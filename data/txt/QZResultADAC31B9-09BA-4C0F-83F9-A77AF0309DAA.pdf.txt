Abstract
Non–small cell lung carcinoma patients are frequently treated with cisplatin (CDDP), most often yielding
temporary clinical responses. Here, we show that PARP1 is highly expressed and constitutively hyperactivated
in a majority of human CDDP-resistant cancer cells of distinct histologic origin. Cells manifesting elevated
intracellular levels of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins (PARhigh) responded to pharmacologic PARP inhibitors
as well as to PARP1-targeting siRNAs by initiating a DNA damage response that translated into cell death
following the activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Moreover, PARP1-overexpressing tumor cells
and xenografts displayed elevated levels of PAR, which predicted the response to PARP inhibitors in vitro and
in vivo more accurately than PARP1 expression itself. Thus, a majority of CDDP-resistant cancer cells appear
to develop a dependency to PARP1, becoming susceptible to PARP inhibitor–induced apoptosis. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Several among the 18 PARP proteins described so far
constitute prospective targets for anticancer therapy
(1, 2). PARP1 and 2 are the most abundant and best-characterized members of this family and are involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, as well as in the maintenance of genomic stability (3–5). PARP1, which is mostly
localized to the nucleus, accounts for approximately 75%

of overall PARP enzymatic activity, ﬁxing PAR polymers on
multiple nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial substrates, including proteins that modulate chromatin structure (e.g., histones, topoisomerases I and II), factors that
stimulate DNA synthesis and repair (e.g., XRCC1, DNA
polymerases a and b, DNA ligases I and II), and transcriptional regulators (e.g., p53; refs. 6–8).
PARP1 has been implicated in DNA repair via the base
excision repair (BER) pathway (9). Upon DNA damage, PARP1
is recruited to single-strand breaks (SSB), where it becomes
activated (10) and catalyzes the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of local
substrates, including histones. As poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation
advances and PAR polymers extend, histones progressively
acquire negative charges, causing their electrostatic repulsion
from interacting proteins and DNA (11). As a result, nuclear
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation facilitates the relaxation of supercoiled
DNA structures, improving the accessibility of DNA to repair
enzymes (12).
PARP1 is characterized by 3 functionally distinct domains:
(i) an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that includes 2 zinc
ﬁngers for the detection of DNA SSBs (13, 14); (ii) an intermediate domain with autoinhibitory poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation sites,
and (iii) a C-terminal catalytic domain that ﬁxes NAD and
transfers its ADP-ribose moiety (which bears one negative
charge) to proteins in an ATP-consuming reaction (15). Several
chemically distinct inhibitors of PARP have been synthesized
and explored for their therapeutic proﬁle against cancer, either
as single agents or within combination regimens (16, 17).
Current clinical trials are evaluating the safety and antineoplastic proﬁle of at least 9 distinct PARP inhibitors (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov/).

PARP inhibitors are currently being evaluated for the
treatment of tumors bearing loss-of-function mutations of
BRCA1 and BRCA2 (18, 19), in particular breast, ovarian, and
prostate cancers. BRCA1 mutations compromise DNA repair
via homologous recombination (HR), obliging cells to correct
double-strand breaks via the less accurate non-homologous
end-joining (20). By interfering with BER, PARP inhibitors
indirectly promote the accumulation of DNA double-strand
breaks (20). In line with this notion, PARP inhibition and lossof-function BRCA1 mutations display a robust synthetic lethality (21). Although initial phase I clinical trials tended to support
this concept (22, 23), less promising results have been obtained
in phase II studies (18, 19), raising an urgent need for predictive
biomarkers. In addition, PARP inhibitors have been used to
sensitize cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents including (but
not limited to) ionizing irradiation, the alkylating agent temozolomide, the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin as well as
platinum compounds such as cis-diammineplatinum(II)
dichloride, also known as cisplatin (CDDP), and carboplatin
(24–26). Some of these combinatorial chemotherapeutic regimens are currently under clinical evaluation (27, 28).
Driven by the facts that non–small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity
and mortality worldwide (29) and that NSCLC patients
often develop resistance against CDDP-based therapies, we
addressed the question as to whether NSCLC cells may respond
to PARP inhibitors. Here, we report the unexpected ﬁndings
that NSCLC cells that have become resistant to CDDP often
overexpress PARP1, constitutively exhibit high levels of PARP
enzymatic activity and apparently rely on it for their survival, as
PARP inhibition kills NSCLC cells that harbor hyperactivated
PARP1.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, culture conditions, and chemicals
The following culture media were used for both wild-type
(WT) cells and their CDDP-resistant counterparts (generated as depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1A): Glutamax-containing Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium/F12 medium
for human NSCLC A549 cells; RPMI-1640 medium for human
NSCLC H460 and H1650 cells; MCDB105/M199 medium for
human ovarian cancer TOV-112D cells, and Eagle's Minimal
Essential culture medium with Earl's salts for human mesothelioma P31, NSCLC H1299, and cervical carcinoma HeLa
cells. Media for cell culture were invariably supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mmol/L HEPES buffer, 100
U/mL penicillin G sodium salt, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin
sulfate. Cell lines were routinely maintained at 37 C under
5% CO2 in T175 ﬂasks and seeded in appropriate supports
(6, 12, or 96 wells plates) 24 hours before experimental
determinations. Authenticated WT cells were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection, immediately ampliﬁed to
constitute liquid nitrogen stocks and (upon thawing) never
passaged for more than 1 month before use in experimental
determinations. Once generated, CDDP-resistant cells were
treated similarly. CEP 8983-07 (CEP) and Z-Val-Ala-Asp
(OMe)-ﬂuoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) were purchased
from Cephalon and Bachem, respectively.

RNA interference
siRNA heteroduplexes speciﬁc for PARP1 (PARP1.a, sense
50 -CAAACUGGAACAGAUGCCGdTdT-30 ; PARP1.b, sense 50 GCCUCCGCUCCUGAACAA UdTdT-30 ; PARP1.c, sense 50 -GAUAGAGCGUGAAGGCGAAdTdT-30 ; ref. 30), as well as 2 nontargeting siRNAs (UNR, sense 50 -GCCGGUAUGCCGGUUAAGUdTdT-30 ; EMR, sense 50 -CCGUGCUCCUGGGGCUGGGdTdT-30 ; ref. 31), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A549 cells
preseeded in 12-well plates were transfected with siRNAs at
30% to 40% conﬂuence by means of the HiPerFect transfection
reagent (Qiagen), as previously described (32, 33). Cells were
used for experiments no earlier than 24 hours after
transfection.
Cytoﬂuorometric studies
For the simultaneous quantiﬁcation of plasma membrane
integrity and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Dym),
both adherent and nonadherent cells were collected, washed,
and costained with 1 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI, which only
incorporates into dead cells) and 40 nmol/L 3,30 -dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide DiOC6(3), a mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Dym)-sensitive dye, (Molecular Probes–Invitrogen), following standard protocols (34, 35). Cytoﬂuorometric acquisitions were conducted on a FACSCalibur (BD
Biosciences), FACScan (BD Biosciences), or Gallios cytometer
(Beckman Coulter). First-line statistical analyses were performed by means of the CellQuest (BD Biosciences) or Kaluza
software (Beckman Coulter), upon gating on events exhibiting
normal forward scatter and side scatter parameters.
Immunoblotting
Cells were collected, washed with cold PBS, and lysed as
previously described (32, 36). Thereafter, protein extracts (30
mg/lane) were separated on precast 4% to 12% SDS-PAGE gels
(Invitrogen), followed by electrotransfer to Immobilon membranes (Sigma-Aldrich) and immunoblotting with antibodies
speciﬁc for PAR (10H; Calbiochem, Merck KGaA), PARP1 (Cell
Signaling Technology Inc.), POLb (Abcam), and XRCC1
(Abcam). An antibody that recognizes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Millipore-Chemicon International) was used to monitor equal lane loading. Finally,
membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotech), followed by chemiluminescence detection with the
SuperSignal West Pico reagent and either CL-XPosure X-ray
ﬁlms (both from Thermo Scientiﬁc-Pierce) or the ImageQuant
LAS 4000 Biomolecular Imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Clonogenic survival assays
To evaluate clonogenic survival, cells were seeded at different concentrations (from 0.2 to 4  103 per well) into 6-well
plates, let adhere overnight, treated for 48 hours with CDDP
and PARP inhibitors, and then cultured in drug-free medium
for up to 10 days. Eventually, colonies were stained with
0.25% (w/v) crystal violet, 70% (v/v) methanol, and 3%
(v/v) formaldehyde in water and quantiﬁed as previously
described (37). Only colonies made of 30 cells and more were
included in the quantiﬁcation. The surviving fraction (SF) was

calculated according to the formula: SF ¼ (number of colonies
formed/number of cells seeded).
In vivo experiments
Mice were maintained in speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions
and all animal experiments were approved by the local Ethics
Committee (CEEA IRCIV/IGR n 26, registered with the French
Ministry of Research), were in compliance with Directive EU
63/2010 and followed the Federation for Laboratory Animal
Science Associations (FELASA) guidelines. Athymic nu/nu 8
weeks old female mice (Charles River Laboratories) were
subcutaneously xenografted with 1  106 WT or CDDP-resistant R6 A549 cells (suspended in 200 mL PBS). Mice were
treated starting from day 8 postinoculation with 5 mg/Kg PJ34
or an equivalent volume of vehicle (PBS) intraperitoneally 3
times a week for 3 consecutive weeks. Tumor growth was
routinely monitored with a common caliper, and tumor volume was calculated according to the formula V ¼ maximal
diameter  perpendicular diameter2.
Statistical procedures
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all experiments were conducted
in triplicates and independently repeated at least 2 times,
yielding comparable results. Data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Co.) and statistical signiﬁcance was
assessed by means of one-tailed Student t tests. P-values were
considered signiﬁcant when lower than 0.05. Minimum effective doses (MED) were deﬁned as the smallest dose to achieve a
statistically signiﬁcant effect over control conditions. MEDs
were computed on the basis of a 4-parameter logistic or 3parameter Emax dose-response models (38). When MEDs
could not be determined within the dose range, maximum
doses are reported. Paired Wilcoxon tests were used to assess
the one-sided hypothesis that MEDs would not differ between
WT cells and their CDDP-resistant counterparts. See also
Supplementary Information.

Results
PARP inhibitors interact with CDDP to induce NSCLC cell
death
To identify pharmacologic agents that may inﬂuence the
activity of the commercial PARP inhibitor PJ34 hydrochloride
hydrate (PJ), we assessed nuclear shrinkage (pyknosis), which
is indicative for the induction of apoptosis (35, 39), in NSCLC
A549 cells exposed to 1,040 U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved drugs alone or combined with PJ for 48 hours.
This screen led to the identiﬁcation of 10 compounds that
induce signiﬁcant apoptosis in the presence, but not in the
absence, of PJ, including alkylating agents such as CDDP,
thiotepa, dacarbazine, and mitomycin C (Fig. 1A and B). The
apparent interaction between PJ and CDDP was conﬁrmed in a
set of independent experiments (Fig. 1C), and this observation
extended to another PARP inhibitor, CEP, whose precursor
(CEP-9722) is currently being tested in phase I clinical trials
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Fig. 1D). On the basis of these
results, we decided to investigate the possibility that PARP
inhibitors might be useful for the treatment of tumors that
become insensitive to CDDP-based chemotherapy.

Selective killing of CDDP-resistant cell clones by PARP
inhibitors
CDDP-resistant NSCLC cell clones were isolated from A549
cells that had been cultured in the continuous presence of
CDDP (2 mmol/L for 6 months followed by 5 mmol/L for 1 year).
This procedure generated nine A549 cell clones (R1–R9) that—
1 month after the withdrawal of CDDP—exhibited variable
extents of CDDP resistance. Thus, as compared with parental,
WT A549 cells, all resistant clones exhibited a reduced
frequency of dying (DiOC6(3)lowPI) and dead (PIþ) cells
upon exposure to CDDP concentrations ranging from 10 to
50 mmol/L (Fig. 2A and B and Supplementary Fig. S1). To get
further insights into the cytotoxic activity of PARP inhibitors in

the context of CDDP resistance, WT A549 cells and all their
CDDP-resistant derivatives were exposed to increasing doses
of CEP or PJ for 48 hours, followed by the cytoﬂuorometric
evaluation of cell death. Unexpectedly, we found that some
CDDP-resistant clones (R1, R2, R3, R6, R7) were more sensitive
than parental A549 cells to both PARP inhibitors used in this
study (CEP and PJ), although a few others were not (R4, R5) or
exhibited intermediate responses (R8, R9). Thus, although 10
mmol/L CEP and 30 mmol/L PJ exerted negligible cytotoxic
effects against WT A549 cells, they did induce signiﬁcant
extents of cell death in several of their CDDP-resistant clonal
counterparts (Fig. 2C and D and Supplementary Fig. S1).
Similar results were obtained in clonogenic assays. Thus,
although the concentration of CDDP that halved the clonogenic potential of parental A549 cells (IC50) was approximately
1 mmol/L, the IC50 of the resistant clone R1 was approximately
5 mmol/L. Conversely, the clonogenic potential of WT A549 cells
was barely affected by exposure to 1 mmol/L CEP or 5 mmol/L PJ,
although that of CDDP-resistant R1 cells was signiﬁcantly
compromised (Fig. 2E and F). In line with these observations,
CDDP-resistant A549 cell clones that were sensitive to the
cytotoxic activity of PARP inhibitors (such as R1) also died in
response to PARP1-targeting siRNAs (Fig. 2G and H).
Altogether, these results indicate that CDDP resistance
often, but not always, entails a hypersensitivity to PARP
inhibition.
PARP hyperactivation predicts the sensitivity of cancer
cells to PARP inhibitors
To characterize the molecular cascades through which
PARP inhibitors kill CDDP-resistant NSCLC cells, we ﬁrst
determined the expression level and activation status of
PARP1. This was achieved by the immunoblotting-assisted
detection of PARP1 and of the products of its enzymatic
activity, that is, poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)-containing proteins.
As compared with their CDDP-resistant counterparts, WT
A549 cells in steady-state conditions exhibited low levels of
both PARP1 and PAR-containing proteins. The amount of PARcontaining proteins increased (at least to some extent) in WT
cells upon addition of CDDP, a phenomenon that could be
entirely suppressed by the administration of CEP or PJ. Conversely, the constitutively high levels of PAR-containing proteins observed in CDDP-resistant clones could not be further
elevated by CDDP, yet were fully suppressed by CEP or PJ
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Of note, CDDP-resistant clones that
were particularly sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of PARP
inhibitors were characterized by higher levels of PAR-containing proteins than clones that responded less efﬁciently to CEP
and PJ (Fig. 3A). These results indicate a correlation between
PARP1 enzymatic activity and the lethal effects of PARP
inhibitors in CDDP-insensitive NSCLC clones.
To assess whether the intracellular levels of PAR-containing
proteins might predict the susceptibility of cancer cells of
different histologic origin to PARP inhibitors, we explored this
parameter in 3 different NSCLC (H1650, H460, H1299), 1
mesothelioma (P31), 1 ovarian (TOV-112D), and 1 cervical
cancer (HeLa) cell lines, invariably comparing parental cells
with their CDDP-resistant derivatives. In 5 out of 6 such

www.aacrjournals.org

pairwise comparisons, CDDP-resistant cells exhibited
increased PAR levels. Only in H1299 cells the amount of
PAR-containing proteins was reduced along with the development of CDDP resistance (Fig. 3B). Importantly, all cell lines
characterized by elevated levels of PAR proteins (PARhigh),
were more sensitive to CEP and PJ than their parental PARlow
counterparts (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table S1). These
results underscore a tight link between high intracellular levels
of PAR-containing proteins (and hence an elevated enzymatic
activity of PARPs) and the susceptibility of cancer cells to
succumb to PARP inhibitors. Of note, although PARhigh cells
tend to express high levels of PARP1 as well, we observed no
absolute correlation between these 2 variables (for instance,
see P31 and TOV-112D cells, Fig. 3B), indicating that PAR levels
predict the sensitivity of cells to PARP inhibition more accurately than the expression levels of PARP1.
Mechanism of cell death induced by PARP inhibitors
CDDP-resistant A549 cells succumbed to PARP inhibitors via
the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, as indicated by the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (assessed by immunoﬂuorescence as the redistribution of cytochrome c from a compartmentalized to a diffuse cytoplasmic localization) and
caspase-3 activation (detected by immunostaining with an
antibody speciﬁc for the cleaved, proteolytically active form of
caspase-3; ref. 40; Fig. 4A). In line with this notion, the
co-administration of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-fmk blunted the cytotoxic effects of CEP or PJ (Fig.
4B). Moreover, CDDP-resistant, but not WT, A549 cells responding to CEP or PJ manifested (at least to some extent) the
apoptosis-associated cleavage of PARP1 (41; Supplementary
Fig. S2). In response to PARP inhibitors, CDDP-resistant cells
also mounted a DNA damage response characterized by an
accumulation of nuclear foci containing histone 2AX phosphorylated on serine 139 (gH2AX) that was far more pronounced
than that of CDDP-sensitive cells (Fig. 4C). In addition, the
percentage of cells exhibiting gH2AXþ foci in steady-state
conditions was signiﬁcantly higher among CDDP-resistant cells
than among their parental counterparts (Fig. 4C). The DNA
damage response elicited by PARP inhibitors was detectable as
early as 6 hours after exposure and could not be suppressed by
the co-administration of Z-VAD-fmk (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Of note, DNA repair via HR appeared to be functional in both
parental cells and their CDDP-resistant counterparts, as
reﬂected by the formation of BRCA1þ and RAD51þ nuclear
foci formation in response to g irradiation (Fig. 4D) or treatment
with PARP inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S4).
As PARP1 is critically involved in the BER pathway, we
comparatively examined the proﬁciency of this DNA repair
system in parental and CDDP-resistant A549 cells. To this aim,
we tested the capacity of cell-free extracts to catalyze the
cleavage of synthetic DNA substrates in assays that reﬂect the
ﬁrst steps in the BER cascade, as catalyzed by apurinic/
apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), alkyl-N-purine DNA glycosylase, human uracil-DNA glycosylase, human endonuclease
III, and human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (42). We found that
WT and CDDP-resistant A549 cells possess similar repair
activities relative to speciﬁc DNA substrates (Supplementary

BER-deﬁcient cells; ref. 43) than their CDDP-sensitive counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Taken together, these results indicate that CDDP-resistant cells that are characterized by high PARP1 expression
levels and high amounts of PAR-containing proteins execute
the early steps of BER as proﬁciently as their WT counterparts, but exhibit some degree of deﬁciency in downstream
reactions such as those catalyzed by XRCC1 and POLb. In
addition, our results indicate that PARP activity may
increase in CDDP-resistant cells in the absence of obvious
HR defects.
Effects of PARP inhibition on CDDP-resistant tumor
xenografts
To validate the hypothesis that PARP-hyperactivating,
CDDP-resistant NSCLCs might respond to PARP inhibitors in
vivo, athymic nu/nu mice carrying parental (WT) or CDDPresistant cell-derived xenografts were treated with PJ. In
contrast to tumors developing from WT A549 cells, which
failed to respond to PJ monotherapy, the growth of cancers
generated by CDDP-resistant cells, which exhibit high levels of

www.aacrjournals.org

PAR-containing proteins (Fig. 3A), was signiﬁcantly delayed by
the administration of PJ as a standalone intervention (Fig. 5A).
Thus, the levels of PAR-containing proteins may be used as a
biomarker to estimate the effects of PARP inhibitors in vivo. To
get further insights into this issue, we developed an immunohistochemical-staining method that speciﬁcally detects PARcontaining proteins on parafﬁn-embedded cell pellets and
tissue sections (as shown by the fact that the siRNA-mediated
depletion of PARP1 as well as the treatment with PARP
inhibitors result in a complete loss of the signal, Fig. 5B). In
the absence of chemotherapy, tumors derived from CDDPresistant R6 cells were characterized by higher levels of PARcontaining proteins than WT A549 cell-derived xenografts (Fig.
5C), indicating that the levels of PAR-containing proteins are
preserved during tumor formation in vivo. Moreover, xenografts featuring high amounts of PAR-containing proteins and
exposed to PJ in vivo underwent a consistent reduction of poly
(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent immunoreactivity (Fig. 5C).
Hence, PARP inhibitors appear to exert antineoplastic effects
in vivo along with a signiﬁcant decrease in PARP enzymatic
activity.

Discussion
Here, we show that NSCLC cell clones that have been
selected for CDDP resistance by prolonged exposure to CDDP
can upregulate PARP1 and hence accumulate elevated levels of
PAR-containing proteins. Both high levels of PAR-containing
proteins and CDDP resistance were maintained upon the
withdrawal of CDDP, suggesting the existence of yet elusive,
genetic or epigenetic mechanisms that stabilize the upregulation of PARP1 and its hyperactivation. Irrespective of these
unresolved issues, the hyperactivation of PARP appears as a
relatively frequent event in the context of acquired CDDP
resistance, as it could be observed in more than half of
CDDP-resistant cells used in this study. As a caveat, the
hyperactivation of PARP is not a universal characteristic of
CDDP resistance but rather constitutes an optional mechanism. Indeed, one of the CDDP-resistant cell lines (H1299)
characterized in this study exhibited a combined reduction in
PARP1 expression levels and in the abundance of intracellular
PAR-containing proteins.
The most striking observation reported in the present study
concerns the ability of PARP inhibitors to kill CDDP-resistant

2278

Cancer Res; 73(7) April 1, 2013

cells that exhibit constitutive PARP hyperactivation. It is therefore tempting to speculate that this trait—which can be monitored by the abundance of PAR-containing proteins—may
reﬂect a situation of PARP-dependent survival. Inhibition of
PARP in PARP-hyperactivating cells led indeed to the activation
of a DNA damage response (as indicated by the appearance of
gH2AXþ foci) and ignited the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
Thus, not only oncogenesis but also the development of chemoresistance appears to be coupled to the constitutive activation of stress response mechanisms that may constitute preferential targets for chemotherapy or chemosensitization (44).
The mechanisms through which CDDP-resistant cells upregulate PARP1 expression and its enzymatic activity remain
largely obscure. Actually, we found that CDDP-resistant cells
can be categorized into different classes, those that overexpress
PARP1 and contain high levels of PAR-containing proteins and
those that do not. This classiﬁcation can be correlated with
other parameters, including (but perhaps not limited to)
XRCC1 and POLb expression levels as well as the cytotoxic
response to the DNA-damaging agent temozolomide. Although
these results are insufﬁcient to establish direct cause–effect

relationships, they suggest a functional connection between
defects in the downstream steps of the DNA repair via the BER
pathway and upregulation/hyperactivation of PARP1.
CDDP remains one of the ﬁrst-line agents for the therapy
for NSCLC, in particular when such tumors lack activating
mutations of the EGF receptor (45). However, NSCLC
patients treated with CDDP often develop chemoresistance,
near-to-invariably leading to relapse and therapeutic failure
(46). Here we show that CDDP-resistant cells respond more
efﬁciently than their WT counterparts to PARP inhibitors. If
the results of in vitro studies could be extrapolated to the
clinics, PARP inhibitors would be most beneﬁcial for (at least
a fraction of) NSCLC patients relapsing after CDDP-based
chemotherapy. In this context, it will be crucial to understand not only to which extent and under which speciﬁc
circumstances PARP inhibitors may be effective as standalone interventions, but also whether the levels of PAR
proteins may be used in clinical settings to predict the
responsiveness of cancer patients to PARP inhibitor-based
chemotherapeutic regimens.
