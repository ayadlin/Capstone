Abstract
Intrauterine and early life exposure to folic acid has significantly increased in North America owing to folic
acid fortification, widespread supplemental use, and periconceptional supplementation. We investigated the
effects of maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation on mammary tumor risk in the offspring.
Female rats were placed on a control or folic acid–supplemented diet prior to mating and during pregnancy and
lactation. At weaning, female pups from each maternal diet group were randomized to the control or
supplemented diet and mammary tumors were induced with 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene at puberty. At
necropsy, mammary tumor parameters, genomic DNA methylation, and DNA methyltransferase activity were
determined in the offspring. Both maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation significantly increased
the risk of mammary adenocarcinomas in the offspring (OR ¼ 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–3.8, P ¼ 0.008 and OR ¼ 1.9, 95% CI
1.1–3.3, P ¼ 0.03, respectively). Maternal folic acid supplementation also significantly accelerated the rate of
mammary adenocarcinoma appearance (P ¼ 0.002) and increased the multiplicity of mammary adenocarcinomas (P ¼ 0.008) in the offspring. Maternal, but not postweaning, folic acid supplementation significantly
reduced global DNA methylation (P ¼ 0.03), whereas postweaning, but not maternal, folic acid supplementation
significantly decreased DNA methyltransferase activity (P ¼ 0.05) in nonneoplastic mammary glands of the
offspring. Our findings suggest that a high intrauterine and postweaning dietary exposure to folic acid may
increase the risk of mammary tumors in the offspring. Further, they suggest that this tumor-promoting effect
may be mediated in part by altered DNA methylation and DNMT activity. Cancer Res; 71(3); 988–97. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Dietary intake and blood levels of folate appear to be
inversely related to the risk of several malignancies in humans
(1). For breast cancer, however, epidemiologic evidence has
not been consistent (2, 3). However, folate status seems to
interact with alcohol, a well-established risk factor for breast
cancer and a folate antagonist, in modifying breast cancer risk;
low folate intake increases, whereas high intake decreases,
breast cancer risk among women who regularly consume
moderate or high amounts of alcohol, but not among women
with low or no alcohol consumption (2). Alarmingly, recent
epidemiologic studies have suggested that high folate intake,

largely from folic acid (the synthetic form of folate that is used
in supplements and fortified foods), and high plasma folate
concentrations may increase breast cancer risk (4–6). The
potential tumor promoting effect of high folate status has
been further suggested in other organs. The Aspirin/Folate
Polyp Prevention Study reported that folic acid supplementation at 1 mg/d for 6–10 years significantly increased the risk of
recurrent colorectal adenomas (7) and of prostate cancer (8)
in subjects with the predisposed colon and prostate that likely
harbored preneoplastic foci. Combined analyses of two Norwegian cardiovascular secondary prevention trials reported
that folic acid (0.8 mg/d) and vitamin B12 significantly
increased cancer incidence, cancer mortality, and all-cause
mortality (9). Furthermore, animal studies have shown that
folic acid supplementation prevents the development of cancer in normal tissues but promotes the progression of established (pre)neoplastic lesions (10–14). Animal studies have
also suggested that supraphysiologic supplemental doses of
folic acid may promote, rather than prevent, the cancer
development (11). Collectively, these observations suggest
folate possesses dual modulatory effects on cancer development and progression depending on the dose and the stage of
cell transformation at the time of high folate exposure or folic
acid supplementation (15, 16).
Several biologically plausible mechanisms exist to explain
the dual effects of folate on cancer development and progression (1). As an essential cofactor for nucleotide biosynthesis,

tube defects and also to the consumption of supplemental
folic acid by up to 30% to 40% of the North American
population (19). In addition, women of childbearing age are
routinely advised to consume folic acid supplementation (0.4–
1.0 mg) for the prevention of neural tube defects (20). These
facts suggest that the developing fetus in North America is
likely exposed to high levels of folate and folic acid. Epigenetic
and metabolic programming takes places during embryogenesis and hence the embryonic stage is highly susceptible to
changes in the intrauterine environment, which may influence
the risk of developing cancer in adulthood (21). In this regard,
the intrauterine nutritional status and hormonal environment
play an important role in mammary gland development and
subsequent breast cancer risk (22). Given these considerations, we investigated the effects of maternal and postweaning
folic acid supplementation on the risk of mammary tumors
and on DNA methylation in the offspring.

folate plays an important role in DNA synthesis, integrity, and
repair, aberrancies of which are integrally related to cancer
development (1). In normal tissues, folic acid supplementation
provides nucleotide precursors for DNA synthesis and replication, thereby ensuring DNA fidelity, maintenance of DNA
integrity and stability, and optimal DNA repair; this would
reduce the risk of neoplastic transformation (1). In contrast,
folic acid supplementation promotes the progression of (pre)
neoplastic lesions by providing nucleotide precursors to the
rapidly replicating transformed cells, allowing accelerated
proliferation (1). Folate also modulates DNA methylation of
cytosine within the cytosine-guanine (CpG) sequences
because its’ role in the provision of S-adenosylmethionine,
the primary methyl group donor for most biological methylation reactions (17). Neoplastic cells simultaneously harbor
widespread global DNA hypomethylation and more specific
regional areas of hypermethylation (17). Global DNA hypomethylation contributes to cancer development through several purported mechanisms including chromosomal
instability (17). In contrast, DNA methylation at promoter
CpG islands silences transcription and hence inactivates the
function of a wide array of tumor suppressor and critical
cancer-related genes (17). Folic acid supplementation appears
to be able to reverse preexisting global DNA hypomethylation
and to increase the extent of global DNA methylation above
the preexisting level (17), thereby reducing the risk of neoplastic transformation. In contrast, folic acid supplementation
may cause de novo methylation of promoter CpG islands of
tumor suppressor genes with consequent gene inactivation
leading to tumor development and progression (1).
Folate intake and blood levels in North America have
dramatically increased over the past decade. This is due to
the drastic increase in dietary folate intake from mandatory
folic acid fortification (18) aimed at reducing the rate of neural

This study was approved by the Animal Care Committee of
the University of Toronto. Six-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats
were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (St. Constant). Female rats were housed in pairs with males when
breeding, and singly during pregnancy and lactation. Female
rats were randomized to receive an amino acid-defined diet
(Dyets) containing 2 mg (control) or 5 mg (supplemented)
folic acid/kg diet, 3 weeks prior to mating and throughout
pregnancy and lactation (Fig. 1). Male rats used for breeding
were placed on the same diet as the female breeding mate.
Litters remained with the mothers until the end of the
weaning period (3 weeks of age). At weaning, 30 pups from

each maternal diet group were killed for baseline plasma folate
and homocysteine (an accurate inverse indicator of tissue
folate status) and hepatic folate measurements (Fig. 1). The
remaining female pups were randomized to receive either the
control or folic acid supplemented diets (Fig. 1).
At puberty (7 weeks of age), 12 pups from each maternal/
pup diet group (total ¼ 48) were killed for folate analyses
(Fig. 1). All remaining pups (n ¼ 70 per each maternal/pup
diet group) received a single intragastric dose of 5 mg of 7,12dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA; Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved
in 1.0 mL of corn oil for mammary tumor induction (23, 24)
and continued to receive the experimental diets until necropsy
at 28 weeks of age (Fig. 1).
Amino acid-defined diets containing different levels of
folic acid constitute a standard method of providing supplemental dietary folate in rodents and have been extensively
used in previous studies of dietary folate and cancer in
rodents (10–14) including mammary tumors (25, 26). The
control diet containing 2 mg of folic acid/kg diet is the basal
dietary requirement (BDR) for rats (27) and was selected to
represent the recommended dietary allowance for humans
(0.4 mg/d of dietary folate equivalents). The supplemented
diet containing 5 mg folic acid/kg diet (2.5 BDR) was
selected to represent the likely average postfortification
total folate intake of 0.8–1.0 mg folic acid/d in North
American populations taking multivitamins containing
0.4 mg folic acid (15), and the recommended dose for all
women planning a pregnancy or capable of becoming pregnant (0.4–1.0 mg folic acid/d; 20). The detailed composition
of the diets has been published previously (14). Diets and
water were provided ad libitum.
Observation parameters
Body weights were recorded weekly. All rats were palpated
for mammary tumors once a week beginning at 4 weeks postDMBA administration. The number, size, and location of each
tumor were recorded in a manner that, after histological
diagnosis, the time of appearance of the cancers could be
determined. All rats were monitored daily for clinical evidence
of illness or morbidity and those approaching a predefined
moribund state (25, 26) were promptly killed.
Sample collection and analysis of mammary tumors
Rats were killed by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by
cervical dislocation. At necropsy, blood was collected and
plasma was stored at –80 C with 0.5% ascorbic acid for plasma
folate determination and without ascorbic acid for plasma
homocysteine assay. The liver and normal mammary tissue
from each rat were excised, snap-frozen, and stored at –80 C
for determination of hepatic and mammary folate concentrations and mammary global DNA methylation and DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) activity.
All macroscopic mammary tumors were counted, excised,
and weighed, and two longest diameters of each tumor were
measured using a digital caliper for final tumor size computation (area calculated using the formula of length/2  width/
2  p). All macroscopic mammary tumors were fixed and
processed in a standard manner for H&E staining and

independently analyzed histologically by 2 study pathologists
(R.R. and A.M.) blinded to the study group.
Folate and homocysteine concentrations
Plasma and tissue folate concentrations were determined
by a standard microbiological microtiter plate assay (25, 26).
Total plasma homocysteine concentrations were determined
using the Axis Homocysteine EIA kit (Abbott Laboratories; 12).
Global DNA methylation analysis
DNA from nonneoplastic mammary tissue was extracted by
a standard technique using proteinase K followed by organic
extraction (25, 26). The size of DNA estimated by agarose-gel
electrophoresis was >20 kb in all instances. The final preparations had a ratio of A260 to A280 between 1.8 and 2.0 and were
free of RNA and protein contamination. The concentration of
each DNA sample was determined as the mean of three
independent spectrophotometric readings.
The methylation status of CpG sites in mammary genomic
DNA was determined by in vitro methyl acceptance capacity
of DNA using 3H-methyl-S-adenosylmethionine (New England
Nuclear) as a methyl donor and a prokaryotic CpG DNMT,
Sss1 (New England Biolabs; 25, 26). The manner in which this
assay is performed produces a reciprocal relationship between
the endogenous DNA methylation status and the exogenous
3
H-methyl incorporation. All samples were run in duplicate
and assays performed twice. Both intra- and interassay CV of
this assay were 5%.
DNMT activity assay
Total cellular DNMT activity was measured by incubating
cell lysates from nonneoplastic mammary tissue containing
10 mg of protein with 0.5 mg of poly[d(I-C).d(I-C)] template
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 3 mCi 3H-methyl-S-adenosylmethionine
(New England Nuclear) for 2 hours at 37 C (28). Each reaction
was performed in triplicate.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were log-transformed due to departure from normality. Characteristics measured at the time of
weaning were analyzed using univariate one-way ANOVA, and
those measured after weaning were analyzed using univariate
two-way ANOVA. Tumor incidence, a binary variable, was
analyzed using logistic regression. Kaplan–Meier and Cox
proportional hazards survival analysis were used to compare
time until tumor appearance (latency) among the four groups.
To correct for any maternally inherited artifacts, tumor incidence was re-analyzed using the general estimating equation
with a binary response variable to take the repeated measures
nature of the data into account. Rat body weights over time,
another repeated measures data, were also analyzed using the
generalized estimating equation. Ordinal variables (litter size,
tumor multiplicity) were assessed using the Kruskal–Wallis
and Mann–Whitney nonparametric tests. With the exception
of the analyses of characteristics measured at the time of
weaning, all analyses included an interaction term between
maternal and pup diets in order to test whether the effect of
the maternal diet depended on the pup diet and vice versa.

Folic Acid Supplementation and Mammary Tumors in Offspring

Significant interactions found in the two-way ANOVAs were
followed by Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference post hoc
analyses to determine the nature of the interaction. Correlations between continuous dependent variables were evaluated
using the Spearman's rank correlation test. All significance
tests were two-sided and were considered significant at P <
0.05. Results are expressed as mean  SEM. Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS 11.0 for Macintosh (SPSS).

Results
Body weight
At weaning, the mean body weight of the pups from the folic
acid supplemented dams was significantly higher, by 13% (95%
CI 1–27%), than that of the pups from the dams fed the control
diet (P ¼ 0.04). The initial difference in pup weights due to the
maternal folic acid supplementation remained significant but
decreased over time (P-interaction for maternal diet  time
<0.001), and disappeared by week 10. The interaction between
maternal and postweaning diet was not significant and postweaning folic acid supplementation did not affect the weight
of pups.
Systemic and tissue folate status
At weaning, plasma folate and homoysteine and hepatic
folate concentrations of the offspring reflected maternal folic
acid supplementation (P < 0.001; Table 1).
At 7 and 28 weeks of age, plasma, hepatic, and mammary
gland folate (P < 0.001) and plasma homocysteine (P ¼ 0.03)
concentrations of the offspring reflected postweaning folic
acid supplementation (Table 1). Maternal folic acid supplementation was reflected in plasma and hepatic folate concentrations of the offspring at both time points (P < 0.001) but
not in mammary gland folate or plasma homocysteine concentrations at either time point (Table 1). A significant interaction between the maternal and postweaning diets was
observed only for increasing hepatic folate concentrations
of the offspring at 7 weeks such that supplementing the
postweaning diet had a larger effect if the maternal diet
was not supplemented (P < 0.001; Table 1) but not for other
folate indices at either time point.
Effect on DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis
All rats were killed at 21 weeks post-DMBA administration
(28 weeks of age) for mammary tumor analysis. No rats died
prematurely. The proportion of rats euthanized for large and/
or ulcerating tumors before the scheduled necropsy was
similar among the four groups (range 6–10%). Consistent with
previous observations (23, 24), >80% of macroscopic mammary lesions were identified histologically as adenomas (15%),
adenocarcinomas (84%), or sarcomas (1%).
Maternal folic acid supplementation significantly accelerated the rate of mammary adenocarcinoma appearance in the
offspring (RR ¼ 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.0; P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 2A; Table 2).
A nonsignificant trend toward an accelerated rate of mammary adenocarcinoma appearance was also observed for
postweaning folic acid supplementation (RR ¼ 1.3, 95% CI
1.0–1.7; P ¼ 0.06; Fig. 2A; Table 2). Maternal folic acid

www.aacrjournals.org

supplementation significantly increased the odds of mammary adenocarcinomas in the pups compared with the control
maternal diet (OR ¼ 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–3.8; P ¼ 0.008; Fig. 2A;
Table 2). Postweaning folic acid supplementation also significantly increased the risk of developing mammary adenocarcinomas in the offspring compared with the control
postweaning diet (OR ¼ 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.3; P ¼ 0.03;
Fig. 2A; Table 2). To control for any maternally inherited
artifacts, tumor incidence was corrected for mother using a
logistic regression analysis; both maternal and postweaning
folic acid supplementation remained significant predictors for
increased tumor incidence (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1–4.8; P ¼ 0.022
and OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2–3.5; P ¼ 0.008, respectively).
Maternal folic acid supplementation also significantly
increased the multiplicity of mammary adenocarcinomas in
the offspring (P ¼ 0.008; Table 2), while a nonsignificant trend
toward an increase was observed for postweaning folic acid
supplementation (P ¼ 0.09; Table 2). The mean weight of
mammary adenocarcinomas was significantly lower in the
pups from the folic acid supplemented dams than in the pups
from the dams fed the control diet (P ¼ 0.03) while postweaning folic acid supplementation had no significant effect
(Table 2). Maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation had no significant effect on the mean size of mammary
adenocarcinomas in the offspring (Table 2). No significant
interaction between the maternal and postweaning diets was
observed for any of the above tumor parameters (Table 2).
A similar pattern of the effect of maternal and postweaning
folic acid supplementation on the combination of all mammary tumors (adenocarcinomasþadenomasþsarcomas) in
the offspring was also observed. Both maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation significantly increased the
incidence of all mammary tumors in the offspring compared
with the corresponding control diets (OR ¼ 1.9, 95% CI 1.0–3.6;
P ¼ 0.05 and OR ¼ 1.9, 95% CI 1.0–3.6; P ¼ 0.04, respectively).
Also, maternal, but not postweaning, folic acid supplementation significantly accelerated the rate of mammary tumor
appearance in the offspring (RR ¼ 1.4, 95% CI 1.0–1.8; P ¼
0.02; Fig. 2B).
Effect on global DNA methylation and DNMT activity in
nonneoplastic mammary glands
Maternal folic acid supplementation significantly
decreased mammary global DNA methylation in the offspring
by 7% (95% CI 1.2–11.6%; P ¼ 0.03; Fig. 3A) compared with the
control maternal diet, whereas postweaning folic acid supplementation had no effect (Fig. 3A). A significant interaction
between the maternal diet and the presence of at least one
mammary adenocarcinoma was observed (P < 0.001); maternal folic acid supplementation significantly decreased mammary global DNA methylation by 18.5% (95% CI 8.5–27.3%; P <
0.001) only in the tumor-free pups, whereas it had no effect in
those bearing at least one mammary adenocarcinoma
(Fig. 3B). Regardless of folic acid supplementation, mammary
global DNA methylation was significantly lower, by 6.7%
(95% CI 1.3–11.8), in the offspring harboring at least one
mammary adenocarcinoma than in the tumor-free pups
(Fig. 3B; P ¼ 0.02).

Maternal folic acid supplementation did not modulate
DNMT activity in the offspring. In contrast, postweaning folic
acid supplementation significantly decreased DNMT activity
by 31% (95% CI 0–52%) in the offspring (P ¼ 0.05; Fig. 3C). No
interactions between the maternal or postweaning diet and
adenocarcinoma status were observed. Among animals bearing at least one mammary adenocarcinoma, a nonsignificant
trend toward a decrease, by 30% (95% CI 0–51%), in mammary
DNMT activity was observed (P ¼ 0.06; Fig. 3D), compared
with the tumor-free pups.

Discussion
In this study, maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation at the level equivalent to the average postfortification total folate intake in North America significantly
increased the incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in
the offspring. Furthermore, maternal folic acid supplementation significantly accelerated the development of mammary
adenocarcinomas and increased the multiplicity of mammary
adenocarcinomas in the offspring, whereas a nonsignificant
trend toward the same effects was observed for postweaning

folic acid supplementation. No significant interaction between
maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation was
observed for any of the tumor endpoints in the offspring. The
mammary tumor promoting effect was more consistent and
greater with maternal folic acid supplementation than with
postweaning supplementation.
We posited that maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation would increase global DNA methylation in the offspring, thereby reducing the risk of developing mammary
tumors. In this study, however, maternal folic acid supplementation significantly decreased mammary global DNA methylation in the offspring. Although this finding may appear
paradoxical, this observation may be partly explained by the
preferential shuttling of the flux of one-carbon units to the
nucleotide synthesis pathway over the methylation pathway in
response to folic acid supplementation. Although folic acid is an
inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (29), it could also upregulate
dihydrofolate reductase in certain situations (30). This upregulation may increase thymidylate synthase activity because the
transcription of these genes is co-regulated by several transcriptional factors (31) and this would increase thymidylate production, thereby increasing cellular proliferation, at the expense of
methylation reactions (32). In contrast, postweaning folic acid
supplementation had no effect on mammary global DNA methylation in the offspring. This observation is consistent with
previous animal studies in which postweaning folic acid supplementation (4–20 BDR) provided continually for up to
27 weeks did not affect global DNA methylation in adult rat
liver (33), colon (11), and mammary glands (25, 26). These
observations collectively suggest that the intrauterine and early
postnatal periods are highly susceptible to the epigenetic modifying effect of maternal folic acid supplementation. Indeed, a
new DNA methylation pattern is established during embryogenesis soon after implantation (34) and DNA methylation of the
developing fetus appears to be highly susceptible to environmental modifiers including maternal supplementation of
methyl group donors (35, 36). Our data demonstrate for the
first time that maternal folic acid supplementation at the level
equivalent to the average postfortification total folate intake in
North America can significantly decrease mammary global DNA
methylation in the offspring.
The functional ramifications of this modest decrease in
global DNA methylation associated with maternal folic acid
supplementation as well as its mechanistic link to the
increased mammary tumorigenesis in the offspring were
not interrogated in this study. Global DNA hypomethylation
is an early, and consistent, event in carcinogenesis (17)
including human breast (37) and rat mammary (25, 26)
cancers. In this study, regardless of folic acid supplementation,
global DNA methylation and DNMT activity in the nonneoplastic mammary glands were lower in the offspring harboring
at least one mammary adenocarcinoma than in the tumor-free
pups. This suggests that global DNA hypomethylation in the
mammary glands might have been a predisposing epigenetic
milieu for mammary tumor development in the offspring.
The facts that the mammary tumor promoting effect was
more consistent and greater with maternal folic acid
supplementation than with postweaning supplementation

and that maternal, but not postweaning, folic acid supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in
global DNA methylation suggest that perturbed intrauterine
and early postnatal epigenetic programming might have
contributed to the initiation and promotion of mammary
tumorigenesis in the offspring. Future studies are warranted
to investigate several downstream effects of global DNA
hypomethylation including chromosomal instability to establish a mechanistic link between global DNA hypomethylation
and increased mammary tumorigenesis in the offspring associated with maternal folic acid supplementation. Maternal
and postweaning folic acid supplementation might have
promoted mammary tumor development in the offspring
through de novo methylation of promoter CpG islands of
tumor suppressor genes, thereby silencing these genes
(1, 17). However, we did not investigate the effect of folic
acid supplementation on promoter CpG islands DNA methylation because most promoters that are subject to DNA
methylation are not conserved between human and rats,
and specific promoters that are presumably epigenetically
regulated in rats have not been extensively characterized
nor have they been implicated in rat mammary tumorigenesis.

Maternal folic acid supplementation had no effect on DNMT
activity whereas postweaning folic acid supplementation significantly reduced DNMT activity in nonneoplastic mammary
glands in the offspring. The DNMT data are not consistent with
the global DNA methylation data and this cannot readily be
explained. Decreased or inactivated DNMT has been shown to
protect against intestinal tumors but increase the risk of
lymphomas and sarcomas in animal studies (1). Although it
is possible that decreased DNMT might have played a role in
the observed increased mammary tumorigenesis in the offspring associated with postweaning folic acid supplementation, further studies are required to elucidate a mechanistic
link between DNMT and mammary tumorigenesis.
There are other potential mechanisms by which maternal
and postweaning folic acid supplementation may increase
mammary tumorigenesis in the offspring. For example, maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation may accelerate proliferation and promote uncontrolled cell growth of
rapidly replicating undifferentiated cells in the mammary
glands of the offspring by providing nucleotide precursors
(1). We determined epithelial proliferation and apoptosis in a
subset of mammary adenocarcinomas from the present study

to test this hypothesis; neither maternal nor postweaning folic
acid supplementation significantly affected epithelial proliferation or apoptosis in mammary adenocarcinomas (Supplemental Table 1). However, future studies are warranted to test
this potential tumor promoting mechanism by studying the
effect of maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation on these endpoints in normal mammary glands during
embryonic and different postnatal developmental stages.
Previous animal studies conducted in another chemical
carcinogen rat model collectively suggest that mild dietary
folate deficiency inhibits, whereas folic acid supplementation
(4–20 BDR) does not modulate, the development and progression of mammary tumors (25, 26, 38). In these studies,
dietary folic acid supplementation was initiated only at weaning (25, 26, 38), suggesting that in utero supplementation has a
drastically different effect on mammary tumor risk. In contrast
to the present study, we have previously reported that maternal

www.aacrjournals.org

folic acid supplementation provided in utero and during lactation significantly reduced the number of terminal end buds of
the mammary glands at puberty, a purported biomarker of
mammary tumor risk in rodents (23, 24), in the offspring (39).
One important distinction between the previous (39) and the
present studies is the difference in the models used: the former
being spontaneous and the current being chemically induced.
Maternal folic acid supplementation may provide a protective
environment for the development of (pre)neopalstic mammary
lesions in the offspring. In the presence of a strong carcinogenic
milieu (in this case, DMBA), however, any preventive effect of
maternal folic acid supplementation on the initiation of mammary tumorigenesis might have likely been overwhelmed.
Regardless of folic acid supplementation, DMBA induced
and established (pre)neoplasic mammary lesions in the offspring and folic acid supplementation promoted the progression of these DMBA-induced (pre)neoplasstic mammary

lesions, similar to the tumor promoting effect of folic acid
supplementation on established (pre)neoplastic colonic
lesions (11–14). Another potential explanation for the contradictory finding between these studies is that terminal end
bud density at puberty may not be a consistent predictor
of mammary tumor risk in rodents as suggested by recent
studies (40, 41).
We reported that maternal, but not postweaning, folic acid
supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of colorectal adenocarcinomas by 64% in the offspring in the azoxymethane rat model (42). In contrast, a study using Apcmin/þ
mice has shown that postweaning folic acid supplementation
significantly increased the number of small intestinal adenomas in the offspring (43). Interestingly, folic acid supplementation provided in utero and lactation and continued through
postweaning period did not increase the number of adenomas
in the offspring (43). In contrast, folic acid deficiency induced
in utero and continued through lactation and postweaning
period significantly reduced the number of adenomas in the
offspring (43). This suggests that the effect of maternal folic
acid supplementation on cancer risk in the offspring may be
organ-specific and may depend on the experimental model.
Epidemiologic studies have reported a protective effect of
periconceptional maternal folic acid supplementation on
several pediatric cancers in the offspring including neuroblastoma and other brain tumors, acute lymphocytic leukemia,
and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (44–47). However, some studies
have not confirmed this purported protective effect (48, 49)
and has even reported an increased risk (46). Furthermore,
most of these epidemiologic studies could not delineate the
effect on cancer risk specific to folic acid from other vitamins
in the supplements (50). At present, no information concerning the effect of maternal folic acid supplementation on breast
cancer risk in the offspring exists in humans.
DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis in rats is different
from human breast cancer in several important aspects: (i) the
use of the genotoxic chemical carcinogen and (ii) molecular

genetic differences (lack of p53 and Brca mutations; 23, 24).
Nonetheless, the DMBA rat model is widely used to determine
the effects of dietary factors on mammary tumorigenesis for
the following reasons: (i) histological similarities of adenocarcinoma to human breast cancer; (ii) molecular genetic similarities (Erb2/HER2, TGFb, and cyclin D1); (iii) a clear operational
distinction between initiation and promotion stages; (iv) hormonally dependent mammary tumorigenesis; and (vi) expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors (23, 24).
In summary, our data suggest that maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation at the level equivalent to the
average postfortification total folate intake in North America
and to that recommended to women at reproductive age
significantly enhances the risk of mammary tumors in the
offspring. Our data also suggest that reduced global DNA
methylation and decreased DNMT activity associated with
maternal and postweaning folic acid supplementation, respectively, may be responsible for the observed increased mammary tumor risk in the offspring. Given the drastically
increased intrauterine and early life exposure to folic acid
and folate in North America (18–20), future studies are
warranted to clarify the effects of maternal and early life folic
acid supplementation on breast cancer risk in the offspring
and associated mechanisms.
