ABSTRACT
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well-validated oncological target
molecule for monoclonal antibody therapies and Sym004 is a novel anti-EGFR
antibody mixture comprising two recombinant chimeric IgG1 antibodies against nonoverlapping epitopes of EGFR. Because EGFR is highly expressed in the majority
of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), we investigated the efficacy of
Sym004 in human ESCC cell lines. Forty eight ESCC cell lines were treated with three
kinds of anti-EGFR antibodies (Sym004, cetuximab, and panitumumab). Genetic
background was investigated by next generation sequencing. The internalization of
anti-EGFR antibodies into ESCC cells and inhibition of the EGFR signaling cascade
by anti-EGFR antibodies were investigated in vitro. Furthermore, growth inhibition
by anti-EGFR antibody treatment was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Sym004
treatments were more effective at inducing EGFR internalization and degradation
than the two other anti-EGFR antibodies. Sym004 was more sensitive significantly to
cell lines with EGFR gene amplification than those without amplification (P = 0.002).
Growth inhibition of Sym004 was greater than in that of cetuximab or panitumumab
in vitro and in vivo. These studies showed that Sym004 exhibited antitumor activity in
some ESCC cell lines in preclinical settings and warrant a clinical evaluation in patients
with ESCC. EGFR amplification is a potential biomarker of response to Sym004.

INTRODUCTION

to ESCC. The efficacy of cetuximab, an anti-EGFR
antibody, in patients with HNSCC has been demonstrated
in combination with radiotherapy or conventional
chemotherapy. [7, 8]. Based on these evidences, EGFRtargeted therapy is hypothesized to be effective for the
treatment of ESCC, particularly for Asian patients.
Sym004 is a 1:1 mixture of the two novel chimeric
IgG1 anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAb) mAb 992
and mAb 1024. These antibodies bind non-overlapping
epitopes on the extracellular domain III of EGFR and the
primary mechanism of action of Sym004 is thought to be
EGFR cross-linking, internalization and degradation of the

Esophageal cancer (EC) is the 6th leading cause of
cancer death and 8th most common cancer worldwide [1].
Remarkable ethnic differences are seen in EC: more
than 95% of EC patients in Asia show squamous cell
carcinoma histology. Pathological analyses have shown
that high EGFR expression occurs in 70–88% of patients
with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) which
correlates with poor prognosis [2–6]. Moreover, head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits high
levels of EGFR expression with comparable tumor biology

in vitro and in vivo preclinical evidence suggests that
Sym004 is superior to cetuximab and panitumumab in
a several types of cancer, its efficacy has not yet been
demonstrated in ESCC [9–13].
In this study, we used 48 ESCC cell lines and three
kinds of anti-EGFR antibodies (Sym004, cetuximab,
and panitumumab) to analyze the efficacy of anti EGFR
antibodies both in vitro and in vivo.

Seven of 48 cell lines were 50% inhibited by Sym004 at
1 μg/mL, whereas only 3 cell lines were 50% inhibited
by cetuximab and panitumumab at this dose. Although
the effects of these antibody preparations were similar in
KYSE960 cell, the anti-proliferative activity of Sym004
was more potent than those of the two commercially
available anti-EGFR antibodies in OE-21, KYSE590, and
KYSE220 cells (Figure 1B). The IC 50 values of Sym004
were significantly lower than those of cetuximab and
panitumumab in OE-21, KYSE220 cells (Figure 1C).

on the key components of cancer-associated signaling
pathways (Figure 2). In these experiments, EGFR
amplification was found in 9 cell lines (18.7%) including
OE21, KYSE590, and KYSE960 and mutations of
oncogenes MET, PIK3CA, KRAS, and HRAS were detected
in 8.3%, 8.3%, and 6.3% of cell lines, respectively.
Cell lines with EGFR amplification showed
significantly greater (P = 0.002) sensitivity to Sym004
than those without EGFR amplifications (Figure 3A).

However, no difference in the sensitivity was observed
between cells with mutations in PIK3CA and RAS and
those without mutation (Figure 3B and 3C).

Internalization of Sym004 into cells
All anti-EGFR antibodies were located in cell
surface membrane at 0 h incubation (Figure 4). In almost
cell lines tested, Sym004 was sufficiently internalized
into the cytoplasm even after 1h incubation. However,

activities of Sym004 and oncogene activation status were analyzed. The percentages of growth inhibition with treatment at 1 μg/mL of
Sym004 were plotted as box plot, and medians of the group were labeled on each plot as the black bar. Circles indicate outliers with values
between 1.5 and 3 box lengths from the upper or lower edge of the box. Triangles indicate outliers beyond 3 box lengths from the edge of
the box. Cell lines with EGFR gene amplification showed significantly higher sensitivity to Sym004 than without amplification (P = 0.002).
P values were determined by Student’s t-test.

(P = 0.027 and P = 0.009, respectively) and panitumumab
(P = 0.014 and P = 0.001, respectively). To clarify the
mechanisms underlying the superior inhibitory effects of
a Sym004 in the presence of ligand, the phosphorylation
of EGFR and the status of downstream signaling
molecules was investigated in OE-21 and KYSE220
cell lines (Figure 5C). In the presence and absence of
ligand, Sym004 treatment led to a more potent blockade
of EGFR phosphorylation at the Tyr1068 compared with
panitumumab (P = 0.012) in OE-21 cells (Figure 5D). In
OE-21 and KYSE220 cells, similar results were found
for phosphorylation of ERK in the presence of ligand.
Sym004 was also more potent than cetuximab at inhibiting
phosphorylation of AKT in the KYSE220 cell line.

most of the cetuximab and panitumumab were still
located on the cell surface and cells contained only few
visible intracellular vesicles after 1h and even after 3 h in
KYSE590 and OE-21 cell lines.

Degradation of EGFR protein and down
regulation of EGFR signaling cascade by
Sym004
EGFR protein of OE-21, KYSE960, KYSE590 and
KYSE220 cells treated with 10 μg/mL of each antibody
for 2, 4, 8, or 24 h were investigated by Western blotting
analysis. EGFR levels were dramatically decreased by
Sym004 in all three cell lines, whereas small decrease in
EGFR level was observed by cetuximab or panitumumab
(Figure 5A). Quantification of band intensities showed
that Sym004 reduced the total EGFR level by 60 to 80%
within 24 h in the four cell lines (Figure 5B). In OE21
cells and KYSE220, reduction of EGFR protein by
Sym004 was significantly more effective than cetuximab

DISCUSSION

EGFR antibodies compared with the group treated with
saline (P < 0.001) (Figure 6A). Body weight loss was
not observed in any groups (Figure 6C). Subsequently,
xenograft tumors were established from OE-21 cells, and
the effects of the three anti-EGFR antibody preparations
were compared following i.p. injections (Figure 6B).
In this OE-21 xenograft model, 50 mg/kg Sym004
caused rapid and complete response of all tumors and
maintained no tumor recurrence for over 90 days after
treatment (Figure 6E). In the cetuximab group (1/6) and
panitumumab group (1/6), complete response was also
observed. However, the other of them were regrowth
during the observation period (Figure 6F). Importantly, no
differences in body weight changes as an adverse effect
were observed between anti-EGFR antibody treatment
groups (Figure 6D).

Overexpression of the EGFR is correlated with
prognosis of several kind of cancer and activated EGFR
signals via the RAS, ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways.
This correlation may result in chemotherapeutic
resistance, angiogenesis, and enhanced tumor progression
[14]. Hence, EGFR-targeted therapy is a promising
approach for cancer treatment and significant efficacy of
anti-EGFR antibody, such as cetuximab, has been shown
in HNSCC. However, in recent clinical trials of ESCC,
combination treatment with cetuximab and radiotherapy
or conventional chemotherapy failed to show significant
additional treatment efficacy [15–17]. Previous studies
have reported that mixtures of antibodies targeting
multiple distinct epitopes are more effective than single

cell lines were treated with 10 μg/mL of anti-EGFR mAbs for 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Cells were then lysed and cell extracts were analyzed using
Western blotting for EGFR and beta-actin (loading control). (B) Band intensities at 24 h (from Figure 5A) were quantified, and EGFR
expression levels were normalized to those of β-Actin. Reduction of EGFR protein was observed in OE-21 and KYSE 220 cells treated by
Sym004 significantly more effective than those by cetuximab (P = 0.027 and P = 0.009, respectively) and panitumumab (P = 0.014 and
P = 0.001, respectively). (C) The immunoblot analyses of the effect of EGF stimulation on phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream

mAbs [18]. Sym004 was developed following screening
of more than 400 different mAb combinations based on
the highest capacity to inhibit cell growth. Sym004 is a
mixture of anti-EGFR mAb 992 and 1024 that targets
non-overlapping epitopes (epitope 992 vs. 1024) in EGFR

extracellular domain III. These two epitopes are different
from the epitopes of cetuximab and panitumumab [11, 19].
Therefore, Sym004 is hypothesized to be more effective
than approved anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies for the
treatment of ESCC.

levels. (D) No difference of effect on body weight among the tested anti-EGFR antibodies was observed. (E) Photograph of OE-21 xenograft

In the present study, Sym004 exerted more potent
growth inhibition than cetuximab or panitumumab in a
panel of 48 ESCC cell lines. Interestingly, ESCC cell lines
with EGFR amplification tended to be more sensitive to
Sym004 in in vitro cell proliferation assays (Figure 3A).
Cetuximab was initially approved for patients with EGFR
overexpressing colorectal cancer. However, following
retrospective studies failed to show correlation between
efficacy of the agent and intensity of EGFR-overexpression
[20, 21], although there was positive correlations between
EGFR amplification and responses to anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody–based treatments [22, 23].
The clinicopathological analysis of ESCC showed
that EGFR amplification occurred in 24%–28% of ESCC
patients and were significantly associated with highlevel overexpression of EGFR [24, 25]. In our study,
EGFR amplification was observed more frequently in
EGFR relative high expression cell lines (Figure 2).
High EGFR gene copy number or EGFR amplification
is correlated with advanced pathologic stage and more
number of the metastatic lymph nodes in ESCC [26, 27].
EGFR amplification may be helpful in predicting patient’s
outcome, however, it is not definite as a poor prognosis
factor. Although further studies are required to characterize
the mechanisms underlying the relationship between
EGFR amplification and sensitivity to Sym004, the present
study showed that the importance of the internalization
ability of Sym004 following the binding of the mAb to
EGFR suggesting that high level presentation of EGFR on
cancer cells is associated with responses to Sym004.
KRAS mutations in the exon 2 are reportedly
predictive of resistance to anti-EGFR mAb therapy, and
a retrospective analysis of RAS mutations in specimens
from a randomized trial of combination chemotherapy for
metastatic colorectal cancer (the PRIME trial) indicated
that, similar to KRAS exon 2, mutations in KRAS exons 3
and 4 and NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4 were negative predictive
factors to panitumumab [28]. However, KRAS and NRAS
mutations are rarely observed in esophageal cancer [25].
In HNSCC, HRAS mutations are more common than
KRAS mutations [29]and this mutation exhibited de novo
resistance to cetuximab-based therapy [30]. In our study,
KRAS and HRAS mutations were found in only one and
two of 48 ESCC cell lines, respectively, indicating no
significant correlation between Sym004 responses and
these mutations. Similarly, relationships between PIK3CA
mutations and responses to anti-EGFR mAb remain
controversial [22, 23, 31], and the present data showed
no differences in Sym004 sensitivity between PIK3CA
mutant and wild-type cancer cells.
The lack of statistically significant difference between
Sym004 and the cetuximab or panitumumab in the KYSE960
xenograft model was not surprising, because in vitro
result showeds that Sym004 and the other anti-EGFR mAb
were equally effective in the growth of KYSE960 cells. On
the other hand, tumor eradication of OE-21 xenografts was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

achieved in all of the mice treated with Sym004 without
any recurrences during the observation period. Sym004 was
significantly more potent in tumor growth inhibition than
cetuximab or panitumumab, respectively. This difference
of anti-tumor effect in OE-21 cell line can be explained
by the enhanced capability of Sym004 to induce EGFR
internalization and degradation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
TE series and EC-GI-10 cell lines were established
from Japanese patients and were obtained from Japanese
Collection of Research Bioresources (Tsukuba, Japan).
KYSE series cell lines established from Japanese
patients were obtained from the Health Science Research
Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). OE-21 established
from British was obtained from the European Cell
Culture Society (Wiltshire, UK). Cells were maintained
in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Cell Culture Technologies, GaggenauHoerden, Germany), 100-units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin and 25 μg/mL amphotericin B (Sigma,
St.Louis, MO) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2 at 37°C.

Compounds and antibodies
Sym004 was provided by Merck Serono Co., Ltd.
(Tokyo, Japan). Commercially available cetuximab
(Erbitux; Merck Serono Co., Ltd) and panitumumab
(Vectibix; Amgen, Tokyo, Japan) were used in this study.
Antibodies against EGFR (D38B1), phosphorylated EGFR
(Tyr1068), Akt, phosphorylated-Akt (Ser473), ERK1/2,
phosphorylated-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Thr204) and β-actin were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

Western blotting analysis
Cells were lysed in a radio immunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0),
150-mM sodium chloride, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% NP-40 (Wako,
Osaka, Japan) with protease inhibitor and phosphatase
inhibitor (Wako). Cell extracts were denatured,
subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (BioRad, Hercules, CA) using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer
machine (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then placed in a
protein detection system (SNAP i.d.; Millipore, Billerica,
MA) and were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T, Sigma) and
0.2% Difco skim milk (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). Membranes were then incubated in dilution

buffer (0.3% skim milk in 0.1% PBS-T) with primary
antibodies for 10 min at room temperature. Antibodies
were used at the following dilutions: against EGF
Receptor (1:200), phosphorylated EGFR (1:200), Akt
(1:200), phosphorylated-Akt (1:400), ERK1/2 (1:200)
and phosphorylated-ERK1/2 (1:400) as indicated.
Subsequently, membranes were washed with a tris
buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T),
and proteins were visualized using ECL prime substrate
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). For analysis of EGFR
signaling, cancer cells were serum starved overnight
and pretreated with 10 μg/mL of control mAb, Sym004,
cetuximab or panitumumab for 8 h and then left
unstimulated or stimulated with 1 nmol/L EGF (R&D
Systems) for 7.5 min. Western blots were imaged using a
ChemiDoc XRSþ System (Bio-Rad).

antibodies at 37°C for 0, 1 and 3 h. After rinsing with
PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako)
for 10 min and then nuclear stained with DAPI solution
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Fluorescent images were
acquired using a BZ-900 instrument (Keyence, Osaka,
Japan).

Xenograft studies
Cells (approximately 1 × 107 cells) were suspended
in 0.2 mL of PBS and were inoculated subcutaneously
into the right flanks of 5-week-old BALB/c nu/nu
mice (Charles River Laboratories Japan, Yokohama,
Japan). Mice were maintained in cages under specific
pathogen-free conditions, provided with standard food,
and given free access to sterilized water. Mice were
monitored daily, and tumor volume was measured one
or two times weekly using calipers. Tumor volumes
were calculated using the following formula: 1/2 × L ×
W2 (L = length; W = width). When tumor volume was
reached to 100 mm3, mice were randomly divided into
4 tests group consisting of saline, Sym004, cetuximab
and panitumumab group. Antibodies were administered
at 50 mg/kg twice weekly by intraperitoneal injection.
All animal procedures were carried out in compliance
with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental
Animals established by the Committee for Animal
Experimentation from the National Cancer Center, Japan.
These guidelines meet the ethical standards required by
law and also comply with the guidelines for the use of
experimental animals in Japan.

Analysis of genetic background
DNA was extracted from cell lines by using the
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan) in
accordance with manufacturer’s instructions and was
stored at –20°C until use.
Genetic background were analyzed by an Ion
PGM (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA) using an
Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, which
allows the characterization of mutational hotspots in 50
cancer-related genes according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Viability assays
The growth-inhibitory effects of Sym004, cetuximab
and panitumumab were examined using tetrazolium
salt based proliferation assay (WST-8 assay: Dojindo,
Kumamoto, Japan). All cell lines were seeded into 96-well
plates in sextuplicate at a density of 1.5 × 103 cells/ 100 μL
and were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The cells were then
treated with various concentrations of Sym004, cetuximab
and panitumumab for a total of 96 h under the same
conditions. After the removal of medium, WST-8 solution
(10 μL) and medium (90 μL) were added to the wells, and
the plates were incubated for a further 2 h at 37°C. Finally,
growth-inhibitory effects were assessed using a 96-well
spectrophotometric plate reader (SpectraMax 190, Molecular
Devices Corp., CA). The 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) was determined from dose–response curves. All
experiments were repeated three times independently.

Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean ± standard
deviation (SD), and statistical significance was analyzed
using ANOVA with Tukey or Dunnet multiple comparison,
as appropriate. Statistical analyses were performed using
IBM® SPSS® Statistics version 21 (IBM Corporation,
Armonk, NY). All tests were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

CONCLUSIONS
Sym004 exhibited significant tumor growth inhibition
in a subset of ESCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo with
pronounced activities in comparison with other anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab.
These analyses suggest that EGFR amplification may be
a potential predictive biomarker to Sym004 in clinical
implication to ESCC.

Immunofluorescence assays
In order to monitor internalization of the
antibodies, they were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647
using antibody labeling kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
In these experiments, 1.5 × 103 cells were pre-cultured
in culture slides (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY)
and incubated with 20 μg/mL of Alexa647-conjugated
