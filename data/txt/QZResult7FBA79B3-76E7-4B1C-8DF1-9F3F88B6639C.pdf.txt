Abstract
Rituximab efficacy in cancer therapy depends in part on induction of complement-dependent cytotoxicity
(CDC). Human CD59 (hCD59) is a key complement regulatory protein that restricts the formation of the
membrane attack complex, thereby inhibiting induction of CDC. hCD59 is highly expressed in B-cell non–
Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and upregulation of hCD59 is an important determinant of the sensitivity of NHL
cells to rituximab treatment. Here, we report that the potent hCD59 inhibitor rILYd4 enhances CDC in vitro and
in vivo, thereby sensitizing rituximab-resistant lymphoma cells and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
(CLL) to rituximab treatment. By defining pharmcokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of rILYd4 in mice, we
showed that by itself rILYd4 does not adversely mediate in vivo hemolysis of hCD59-expressing erythrocytes.
Increasing expression levels of the complement regulators CD59 and CD55 in rituximab-resistant cells occur due
to selection of preexisting clones rather than de novo induction of these proteins. Moreover, lymphoma cells
overexpressing CD59 were directly responsible for the resistance to rituximab-mediated CDC therapy. Our
results rationalize the use of rILYd4 as a therapeutic adjuvant for rituximab treatment of rituximab-resistant
lymphoma and CLL. Furthermore, they suggest that preemptive elimination of CD59-overexpressing subpopulations along with rituximab treatment may be a useful approach to ablate or conquer rituximab resistance.

Introduction
In the last 10 years, the chimeric antibody (Ab) of
rituximab, which specifically targets CD20 on the B lymphocyte membrane, has led to significant progress in the
treatment of B-cell non—Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; ref. 1).
However, a subset of NHL patients do not respond to
rituximab, despite expressing CD20 (2), and many patients
who initially respond develop resistance to further treatment over time (3). The mechanisms suspected to mediate
therapeutic effects of rituximab include (i) complementdependent cytotoxicity (CDC; refs. 4–7); (ii) Ab-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC; refs. 2, 8–10) involving phago-

cytosis (11) and/or Fc:FcR-dependent mechanisms (12); and
(iii) apoptosis (1, 9, 12).
The role of the CDC on rituximab-mediated lymphoma
therapy has been extensively investigated in vivo and in vitro
(9). Complement depletion by cobra venom factor or C1qdeficiency significantly reduces the antitumor activity of
rituximab in mouse models (6, 13–15). Consistently, complement consumption has been observed in vitro and in vivo after
rituximab administration (5, 16), and addition of fresh-frozen
plasma as a source of complement can increase the therapeutic response to rituximab in CLL-refractory patients (17,
18). The importance of CDC in B-cell lymphoma response to
rituximab was further confirmed by the finding that Abs that
abrogate the function of membrane complement regulatory
proteins (mCRP) such as CD46, CD55, and CD59 enhance the
therapeutic effect of rituximab in animal models of the disease
(2, 4, 19–24).
The complement system is the principal part of the innate
immune system and plays an important role in host defense.
To prevent the potentially harmful effect of complement
activation on normal cells, some mCRPs including CD46,
CD55, and CD59 have evolved to restrict complement activation at different stages of the complement cascades (9, 25).
CD59, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored mCRP,
restricts formation of the membrane attack complex by
preventing C9 polymerization through binding to C8 and
C9 (26). CD55, another GPI-anchored mCRP, inactivates the
C3 and C5 convertases by accelerating the decay of these

proteases (27–29), whereas CD46, a non–GPI-anchored membrane protein, acts as a cofactor for inactivation of cell-bound
C4b and C3b by serum factor I (30). Not only do these mCRPs
protect normal cells from bystander complement attack but
also they confer protection to cancer cells by limiting complement activation by a therapeutic Ab such as rituximab. Numerous findings indicate that CD59 is the most effective mCRP
protecting B-cell lymphomas from rituximab-mediated CDC
(2, 4, 21, 31). Dalle and colleagues have recently found that
CD59, but neither CD46 nor CD55, is overexpressed in an in vivo
model of rituximab-resistant (RR) follicular lymphoma (FL)derived tumor cells isolated from a patient (32). Moreover, in a
clinical study of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Bannerji
and colleagues found a significant increase in hCD59 expression in patients who failed to clear CLL cells from peripheral
blood after initiation of rituximab treatment (33). Taken
together, these results suggest that the overexpression of
mCRPs, and especially CD59, contributes to the resistance
of lymphoma and CLL cells to rituximab therapy (34, 35).
For these reasons, the development of a molecule capable of
abrogating CD59 function in cancer cells is likely to fulfill an
unmet clinical need.
Recently, we have generated a specific high-affinity inhibitor of hCD59 denoted as rILYd4 (36), which is the recombinant
114 amino acid peptide representing domain 4 (D4) of intermedilysin (ILY), a cytolytic toxin secreted by Streptococcus
intermedius. We have shown that rILYd4 binds to the hCD59
functional site and thereby abrogates hCD59 function (36).
Here, we further show that rILYd4 sensitizes RR B-cell NHL
and primary CLL cells to rituximab treatment in vitro, ex vivo,
and in vivo. The results indicate that rILYd4 may provide a
novel therapeutic approach as an adjuvant to rituximab for
the treatment of lymphoma.

Materials and Methods
Additional information is available in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Mice
Animal studies were approved by the Harvard Medical
School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Balb/C nude mice used for the determination of rILYd4 in
vivo efficacy were purchased from Charles River Laboratory.
Mice specifically expressing hCD59 as a transgene in the
erythrocytes of mCd59a and mCd59b double-knockout mice
(hCD59RBCþ//mCd59ab/) were used for pharmcokinetic/
pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and toxicity studies. hCD59RBCþ/

/mCd59ab/ were generated by crossing the mCd59a and
mCd59b knockout mouse (mCd59ab/; ref. 37) with a hCD59
transgenic mouse (ThCD59RBC), in which hCD59 was specifically expressed under the control of the hemoglobin promoter
at a level comparable with that seen in human erythrocytes
(38).
B-lymphoma and primary CLL cells and reagents
Human Burkitt's B-cell lymphoma Ramos, Daudi, and Raji
cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collec-

tion and cultured in the RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100
mg/mL streptomycin. These cell lines were authenticated by
the supplier, obtained within 6 months of their use, and
passaged less than 50 times. We did not reauthenticate the
cell lines.
The CLL patients had been previously enrolled on DanaFarber Harvard Cancer Center (DFHCC) protocol 99-224. All
participants signed informed consent prior to sample collection. The blood from CLL patients was then separated on a
Ficoll gradient and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were frozen. The frozen PBMCs from 6 patients
participating in this study (Supplementary Table 1) were
cultured in IMDM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% human AB serum (GemCell; Gemini Co.), 50 mg/mL
transferrin (Roche Applied Science), 5 mg/mL human insulin
(Roche Applied Science), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin.
Intact ILY and rILYd4 tagged with HisX6 at its N-terminals
were purified as described elsewhere (36, 38).
Generation of RR and hCD59-negative Ramos cell lines
We used a previously reported procedure (31) to develop
Ramos cells resistant to CDC at different concentrations of
rituximab. The cells generated were denoted as RR0.2, RR0.8,
RR3.2, RR12.8, and RR51.2 because they could survive complement attack induced by rituximab (Biogen Idec) at concentrations of 0.2, 0.8, 3.2, 12.8, and 51.2 mg/mL, respectively, all in
the presence of 10% normal human serum (NHS; Valley
Biomedical). We followed the same procedures to generate
rituximab-resistant NHL Daudi and Raji cells.
The hCD59-expressing subpopulations in all of the aforementioned Ramos cell lines were removed with repeated
intact ILY treatment (5 mg/mL, on 3–5 occasions), and the
surviving Ramos cell subpopulations were regarded as hCD59negative cells, which was further confirmed by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.
Isolation of CD59-expressing population by cell sorting
Parental or original Ramos (OR) cells were stained with
anti-hCD59 Ab and fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated
secondary Ab. Cells staining positive for CD59 (0.38% of the
total population) were collected in the first round by cell
sorting (CS) and then grown in culture medium. When the
cells reached 5  106 cells/mL density, a second round of CS
was carried out to collect cells positive for CD59 (5% of the
total population) for further experiments. Cells sorted through
2 rounds of selection of the CD59-positive population are
termed CS cells.
Rituximab-mediated CDC on Ramos cells and primary
CLL cells
Cell viability was determined by either Trypan blue or
Alamar blue assay (4). A total of 5  104 Ramos cells per
well were seeded on 96-well plates. Rituximab (10 mg/mL) and
10% NHS were added to the wells (total volume: 200 mL/well)
in the absence and presence of different concentrations of
rILYd4, and plates were incubated at 37 C. For the Trypan

blue assay, complement activation was stopped after a 1-hour
incubation on ice, followed by staining with 0.04% Trypan
blue. The dead cells identified by the blue staining were
counted in a blinded fashion, and cytolysis was expressed
as the fraction of dead cells out of the total number of cells. For
the Alamar blue assay, cells were treated for 4 hours and then
30 mL Alamar blue and 70 mL culture medium were added to
each well and incubated overnight. Cytolysis was assessed by
reading the plates in an F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi; excitation: 560 nm; emission: 590 nm). The
medium alone (without cells), NHS alone, and heat-inactivated human serum (IHS) alone were used as control for
background in the relevant calculation. The positive control,
considered 100% cytolytic, was Triton X-100 (0.1% in
Dulbecco's PBS)-treated wells and negative control were cells
without any treatment. Percent lysis in each well was calculated as follows: [(fluorescence in negative control well 
fluorescence in test well)/fluorescence in negative control
well]  100.
The primary CLL cells spontaneously die after culturing
for several days. Thus, we had to carry out the experiments
individually. Primary CLL cells were seeded on 96-well
plates at 2  106 cells/mL. Different concentrations of
rILYd4, 20 mg/mL rituximab, and 20% NHS (total 200 mL/
well) were added to the corresponding wells and incubated
at 37 C. After 3 hours of incubation, plates were placed on
ice to stop complement activation, followed by staining
with 0.04% Trypan blue. Blue stained dead cells were
counted by 2 independent investigators, and cytolysis
was estimated from the fraction of dead cells as described
earlier.
Anticancer efficacy of rILYd4 in vivo
To ensure the resistance of the RR51.2 cell line, we treated
RR51.2 cells with 51.2 mg/mL rituximab and 10% NHS for 1
hour at 37 C before xenografting the cells into the nude
mice. A total of 1  107 cells suspended in 100 mL 50%
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) diluted in serum-free culture
medium were implanted subcutaneously on the left flank
of each Balb/C nude mouse. An early development model
(the mice had no measurable tumor) or an established
tumor model (the mice had an average 0.15 g tumor) was
used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of rILYd4. After grafting,
treatment was carried out at day 6 in the development
model and, at day 18, in the established tumor model.
Rituximab (2 mg/kg) without or with rILYd4 (2 mg/kg)
was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) on 3 occasions 4 days
apart (Q4D). Tumors size was measured with calipers and
tumor mass was calculated by the following formula:
(width)2  length/2 (39, 40). Tumor-free rate in the established tumor model was expressed as the fraction of the
number of the mice without the tumor at 35 days after the
treatment out of the total number of mice with the tumor
before the treatment.
Data analysis
The difference between means of paired samples on primary CLL cells was evaluated by Wilcoxon's signed-rank test.

In the other experiments, the comparison between 2 or3
groups was examined with a nonparametric Mann–Whitney
test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
rILYd4 sensitizes RR cells to a rituximab-mediated CDC
effect in vitro
We generated 5 RR Ramos cell lines and showed that the
increase in CD59 expression levels correlated with the degree of
resistance to rituximab-mediated CDC (Fig. 1A and B). In
contrast, the level of CD20 expression was not altered by the
selection of rituximab resistance (Supplementary Fig. 1). These
results confirmed functionally the generation of RR cells.
Intact ILY binds exclusively to hCD59 and rapidly lyses
hCD59-expressing cells (38, 41). Repetitive exposure of OR and
RR Ramos cells to ILY was used to enrich for the subpopulation of CD59-negative cells. Elimination of CD59-expressing
cells was verified by FACS analysis (Fig. 1C). All these hCD59negative cells were very sensitive to rituximab-mediated CDC,
as shown by the complete lysis obtained even with the lowest
dose of rituximab (0.2 mg/mL; Fig. 1D). Taken together, these
in vitro results indicate that the CD59-expressing subpopulation in Ramos cells may be responsible for the resistance to
rituximab-mediated CDC. This interpretation provides a
strong rationale for the utilization of rILYd4 as an adjuvant
in rituximab therapy: rILY4 would sensitize RR cells by abrogating hCD59 function and thereby enhancing rituximabmediated CDC.
The effectiveness of this approach was tested using RR51.2
cells, which express the highest level of CD59 and are resistant
to CDC effect mediated by rituximab at the highest concentration (51.2 mg/mL). The results showed that rILYd4
increased rituximab-mediated CDC in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 of rILYd4 ¼ 0.614 mg/mL or 33 nmol/L; Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. 2A). Treatment of the same cells with
escalating concentrations of rILYd4 in the absence of a
complement source (either no addition of NHS or the addition
of inactivated HS) did not induce cell lysis (Supplementary
Fig. 2B). This result rules out a direct toxic effect of rILYd4 and
confirms the complement-dependent nature of the rituximabmediated cytolysis (Supplementary Fig. 2B).
rILYd4 sensitizes primary CLL cells to rituximabmediated CDC ex vivo
The clinical relevance of the aforementioned findings was
shown by the capacity of rILYd4 to sensitize primary CLL cells
to rituximab-mediated CDC effects ex vivo. The selection of
primary CLL cells instead of B-cell NHL was dictated by their
greater accessibility. Treatment of CLL primary cells obtained
from 6 different patients (Supplementary Table 1) with escalating doses of rILYd4 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in
the rituximab-mediated CDC effect in all the samples (Fig. 2B
and C). Determination of the levels of CD20 and CD59 on
the surface of the CLL cells from each patient by FACS
analysis showed that the cells from subject CLL-1 that express
CD20 at the highest level are also the most sensitive to the
induction of rituximab-mediated CDC by rILYd4 (Fig. 2D and

Supplementary Fig. 3). This observation suggests that CD20
level may be associated with the sensitivity to rILYd4 treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that rILYd4
sensitizes RR NHL and CLL cells to rituximab-mediated
CDC in vitro and ex vivo, respectively.
Potential mechanism of upregulation of CD59 in RR
Ramos cells
Here, we document that the levels of GPI-anchored
proteins such as mCRP CD59 (Fig. 1) and CD55, as well
as non-mCRP CD48, but not non–GPI-anchored proteins
such as CD20 and mCRP CD46 gradually increased on the
surface of these RR Ramos cells (Supplementary Fig. 1).
These results are consistent with the findings as reported
previously by Takei and colleagues (31). More interestingly,
after removing the CD59-expressing subpopulation with ILY
pretreatment, the expression of the other GPI-anchored
proteins CD55 and CD48 disappeared simultaneously in
the residual CD59-negative subpopulation whereas the
expression of non–GPI-anchored proteins such as CD20
and CD46 remained unchanged (Fig. 1C and Supplementary

www.aacrjournals.org

Fig. 4). To investigate the potential mechanism of the
upregulation of CD59 in RR Ramos cells, we used a CS
method to enrich and characterize the CD59-expressing
population from OR cells. The enriched CD59-positive cell
population expressed CD20, CD46, CD59, CD55, and CD48
(Fig. 3A) at a similar level and had the same sensitivity to
rituximab-mediated CDC as the RR51.2 cells (Figs. 1A, 2B,
and 3C and Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, rILYd4 also
sensitized CD59-enriched CS cells to rituximab-mediated
CDC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). Furthermore,
the CD59-negative subpopulation obtained from ILY-treated CS cells (Fig. 3B) was sensitive to rituximab-mediated
CDC (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results indicate that
increased detection of GPI-anchored proteins in CD59positive Ramos cells by multiple challenges with rituximab
and complement may result from serial enrichment of the
CD59-positive cells but not from induction of CD59 expression. Therefore, the elimination of the CD59-expressing
subpopulation by combination treatment with rituximab
and CD59 inhibitor such as rILYd4 may be a powerful
approach to conquer rituximab resistance.

rILYd4 sensitizes RR51.2 cells to rituximab-mediated
CDC effect in vivo
Next, we used both developing and established orthotopic
xenograft models to investigate whether rILYd4 sensitizes RR
Ramos cells to rituximab treatment in vivo. We implanted
RR51.2 cells into nude mice following published protocols (39,
40). In the developing xenograft model, we observed that
combination treatment with rituximab and the adjuvant
rILYd4 dramatically slowed down tumor growth as compared
with rituximab alone (Fig. 4A). Importantly, treatment with
only rILYd4 did not affect tumor growth significantly (Fig. 4A).
A similar observation was made in the established xenograft
model, in which combination treatment with rituximab and
the adjuvant rILYd4 resulted in significant reduction in tumor
size as compared with treatment with rituximab alone
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the tumor-free rates in the established
xenograft model after treatment with vehicle, rILYd4 alone,
rituximab alone, and combination of rituximab with rILYd4

were 0%, 0%, 8.3%, and 50%, respectively, suggesting that
treatment with rILYd4 as an adjuvant can lead to elimination
of tumor in 50% of the animals (Fig. 4C).
PK/PD profiles of rILYd4
The circulating half-life (t1/2) and volume of distribution of
rILYd4 were determined after intravenous (i.v.) tail vein
injection of rILYd4 into mCd59ab//ThCD59RBCþ/ mice.
The serum level of rILYd4 showed a biphasic decay curve,
with a fast initial distribution followed by a slower elimination
phase. PK parameters are shown in Figure 5A. The half-life of
rILYd4 in vivo was 2.71 hours, with a distribution volume of
383 mL/kg. The distribution of rILYd4 indicated by the Vss
(distribution volume) is likely due to the binding of rILYd4 to
hCD59 on the erythrocytes of compound mice mCd59ab/

/ThCD59RBCþ/.
PD study was carried out to evaluate the functionality of
rILYd4. Theoretically, the rILYd4 bound to hCD59 should

Figure 3. Expression of CD20, CD46, CD59, CD55, and CD48 on CD59-enriched CS cells with and without ILY pretreatment and their response to
CDC effect induced by rituximab in vitro. FACS analysis on CS cells without ILY pretreatment (A) and with ILY pretreatment (B). Cells were stained with antiCD20, CD46, CD59, CD55, and CD48 Ab (black lines) or isotype-matched Ab (solid gray lines). CS cells are resistant to CDC effect as measured by Alamar blue
assay, which is similar to RR51.2 cells (C). rILY4 sensitizes CD59-expressing cells to the CDC effect of rituximab as measured by Alamar blue assay
(D). The hCD59-negative cells enriched from CS cells by the ILY pretreatment are very sensitive to rituximab-mediated CDC (E). Results are mean

inhibit the hemolysis induced by intact ILY (36). Erythrocytes
collected at different time points following treatment with 10
mg/kg rILYd4 showed a clearly time-dependent decline in
protection against ILY-induced hemolysis as measured by the
concentration of ILY required for 50% hemolysis (Fig. 5B).
Concomitant decay of rILYd4 function, as shown by the PD
study, largely overlapped the decline in rILYd4 exposure in
serum as determined in the PK study. Twenty-four hours after
one 10 mg/kg i.v. dose of rILYd4, we could not detect any
additional protection by rILYd4 against the hemolytic activity
of ILY (Fig. 5B).
rILYd4 alone did not mediate hemolytic anemia in
mCd59ab//ThCD59RBCþ/ mice
We have previously reported (36) and also confirmed in this
study that rILYd4 alone has no direct lytic effect on hCD59expressing cells in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 2B). To further
assess its toxicity profile in vivo, we utilized mCd59ab/

/ThCD59RBCþ/ mice. In an acute toxicity study, we found

www.aacrjournals.org

that there were no significant differences in the levels of
hemoglobin content or free plasma hemoglobin (data not
shown) between mCd59ab//ThCD59RBCþ/ mice treated
with rILYd4 or vehicle (Fig. 6A). In the subchronic toxicity
study with administration of rILYd4 for 1 month, rILYd4 did
not result in any significant difference in hemoglobin levels,
reticulocyte counts, and body weight or pathologic changes in
tissues (data not shown) as compared with vehicle alone
(Fig. 6B–D). These results suggest that transient inhibition
of hCD59 function by rILYd4 does not induce hemolysis or any
negative side effects and that rILYd4 is neither acutely nor
subchronically toxic.

Discussion
Here, we show that the administration of rILYd4 abrogates
hCD59 function in RR cells and restores the sensitivity of these
resistant Ramos and primary CLL cells to rituximab-mediated
CDC effects in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. We also document that

the hCD59-overexpressing population of Ramos cells is
responsible for the resistance to rituximab-mediated CDC
in vitro. These results highlight the critical role of CD59 in
the development of rituximab resistance and indicate that
rILYd4 may provide a new approach to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of rituximab by abrogating hCD59 activity.
These interpretations are also supported by our recent findings that rILYd4 could sensitize the lymphoma cell line RL-7 or
the multiple myeloma cell line ARH-7 to rituximab-mediated
CDC (42).
The role of CDC in rituximab therapy was challenged
previously by the findings that the expression of mCRPs does
not predict clinical outcome after rituximab treatment in
follicular NHL (43). Recently, Weiner's group reported that
that the C3b component of complement could inhibit NK cell
activation and ADCC effects during rituximab treatment (10)
and thus C3 depletion improves rituximab antitumor activity
(20). Also, several researches have shown that both CDC and
ADCC play major roles in the antitumor activity of rituximab

2304

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

(2, 8–10). Furthermore, CDC-resistant cells are sensitive to
ADCC, and vice versa (9, 14, 44). Differences in the relative
importance of CDC and ADCC following rituximab treatment
may result from the different types of tumors used, expression
levels of CD20 and mCRP, tumor-inoculating methods, and
tumor growth period (9, 11). Although the investigation of the
relative roles of CDC and ADCC is beyond the scope of our
studies, it will be very helpful for drug design in future and
therefore warrants further investigation.
Since CD59 is universally expressed in human cells with a
relative high level in erythrocytes, potential side effects such as
hemolysis are the potential hurdles for the development of
clinically useful hCD59 inhibitors. Monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) directed against hCD59 are useful tools for the study
of CD59 function in vitro (4, 19, 31). Despite that it is impossible to apply them to cancer therapy, as they bind not only
cancer cells but also many other cells that express hCD59,
potentially inducing ADCC, or CDC, or apoptosis in normal
cells. To address this problem, Ziller and colleagues identified

mini Abs that specifically blocked hCD59 and hCD55 function
(23). They reported that these mini Abs facilitated rituximabmediated lymphoma treatment in vivo; however, although
alone they failed to activate complement, they killed about
25% of cancer cells through ADCC (24). Therefore, to limit this
unwanted side effect on normal cells and improve specific
targeting of cancer cells, they administered biotin-labeled
rituximab in combination with avidin-labeled MB55-MB59
to target the mini anti-CD59 Abs to the cancer cells (24). In
contrast to this approach, rILYd4 restores sensitivity of the RR
lymphoma cells to rituximab treatment in vitro and in vivo.
Moreover, rILYd4 itself does not trigger lysis (36) or ADCC
effect in cells that are nontargeted by the Ab (data not shown)
ex vivo and in vivo. Therefore, rILYd4 may be a safe and
effective adjuvant for rituximab therapy.
The higher expression of CD59 in cancer cells such as
lymphoma and rituximab-pretreated lymphoma cells has
been long recognized, but its mechanism remains unclear
(32, 33). Our results indicate that RR Ramos cells overexpressing GPI-anchored proteins including CD59, CD55, and CD48
may result from the positive selection of preexisting cells that
highly express GPI-anchored proteins rather than from the
induction of GPI-anchored proteins. We therefore postulate
that tumor heterogeneity may be responsible for the increase
in the population of highly expressing CD59 lymphoma cells, a
contributor to rituximab resistance. In support of this hypothesis, we show that two other NHL cell lines (Raji and Daudi)
resistant to rituximab-mediated CDC also express a higher
level of CD59 than their parental cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Together, these results indicate that the ablation of

www.aacrjournals.org

those preexisting resistant tumor cells by early treatment with
combination of rILYd4 and rituximab may effectively limit the
expansion of RR lymphoma cells through the abrogation of
this subpopulation of cells expressing high levels of hCD59.
Furthermore, rILYd4 may also sensitize tumor cells that have
acquired resistance to rituximab after multiple therapies
administered for the anticancer activity of rituximab.
We also designed and executed a PK/PD study to evaluate
drug exposure and other kinetic parameters such as t1/2, Cmax,
and volume of distribution in mCd59ab//ThCD59RBCþ/
mice. The avid binding of rILY4 to hCD59 most likely explains
its larger volume of distribution (Vss ¼ 383 mL/kg). For the PD
study, we took advantage of the fact that the preformed
rILYd4–hCD59 interaction on erythrocytes could compete
with binding of the full-length ILY to hCD59 and exert
protection against ILY-mediated hemolysis (36). The comparable PK and PD profiles suggest that rILYd4 bound to erythrocytes remains functional throughout the in vivo exposure.
These data provide insight and guidance for the further
engineering of rILYd4 to better suit biological therapy.
The toxicity profile is critical for identifying a dosing
window to get good efficacy with tolerable side effects. Here,
we show that i.p. injection of 3-fold the effective dose (6 mg/kg,
Q4D  8 times) of rILYd4 did not induce erythrocyte lysis in
hCD59 transgenic mice in a mCd59-deficient background. No
other notable pathologic changes have been observed either.
Overall, at the doses tested, rILYd4 did not show any sign of
unwanted side effects. It remains to be seen whether other
toxic effects emerge upon reaching the maximum tolerated
dose in mice. Immunogenicity is another critical aspect for the
