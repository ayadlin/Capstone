Stable oncogenic silencing in vivo by programmable and
targeted de novo DNA methylation in breast cancer
S Stolzenburg1,2, AS Beltran2, T Swift-Scanlan3, AG Rivenbark4, R Rashwan1 and P Blancafort1,2
With the recent comprehensive mapping of cancer genomes, there is now a need for functional approaches to edit the aberrant
epigenetic state of key cancer drivers to reprogram the epi-pathology of the disease. In this study we utilized a programmable
DNA-binding methyltransferase to induce targeted incorporation of DNA methylation (DNAme) in the SOX2 oncogene in breast
cancer through a six zinc ﬁnger (ZF) protein linked to DNA methyltransferase 3A (ZF-DNMT3A). We demonstrated long-lasting
oncogenic repression, which was maintained even after suppression of ZF-DNMT3A expression in tumor cells. The de novo DNAme
was faithfully propagated and maintained through cell generations even after the suppression of the expression of the chimeric
methyltransferase in the tumor cells. Xenograft studies in NUDE mice demonstrated stable SOX2 repression and long-term breast
tumor growth inhibition, which lasted for 4100 days post implantation of the tumor cells in mice. This was accompanied with a
faithful maintenance of DNAme in the breast cancer implants. In contrast, downregulation of SOX2 by ZF domains engineered with
the Krueppel-associated box repressor domain resulted in a transient and reversible suppression of oncogenic gene expression. Our
results indicated that targeted de novo DNAme of the SOX2 oncogenic promoter was sufﬁcient to induce long-lasting epigenetic
silencing, which was not only maintained during cell division but also signiﬁcantly delayed the tumorigenic phenotype of cancer
cells in vivo, even in the absence of treatment. Here, we outline a genome-based targeting approach to long-lasting tumor growth
inhibition with potential applicability to many other oncogenic drivers that are currently refractory to drug design.

INTRODUCTION
Cytosine methylation in mammalian DNA is regarded as a key
epigenetic modiﬁcation controlling essential processes such as
imprinting, silencing of retrotransposons and cell differentiation.1
In addition to DNA methylation (DNAme), repressive histone posttranslational modiﬁcations reinforce gene inactivation, resulting in
the formation of inactive chromatin, namely heterochromatin.2
Importantly, the epigenetic information must be stably transmitted during mitosis for the proper maintenance of cellular
identity, a process referred as epigenetic memory.3 In pathological
states such as cancer, the epigenetic landscape of normal cells
becomes disrupted. Aberrant incorporation or removal of DNAme
in cancer cells leads to genome-wide alteration of gene
expression, including inactivation of tumor suppressor genes
and reactivation of oncogenes.4 Notably, changes in DNAme
patterns are characteristic hallmarks of the distinct intrinsic
subtypes of breast cancer. Poorly differentiated, highly proliferative basal-like breast cancers associated with stem/progenitor celllike features are signiﬁcantly hypomethylated relative to the other
breast cancer subtypes. Importantly, these tumors are driven by
aberrant activation of multiple developmental transcription
factors (TFs), which fuel the tumor with sustained proliferation,
drug resistance and metastatic capacity.5–7
The High Mobility Group oncogenic TF SOX2 is normally
expressed in embryonic stem cells and neural progenitor cells,

where it maintains self-renewal.8,9 DNAme in the SOX2 promoter
and enhancer regions functions as an epigenetic switch, which
forces cells to activate multiple differentiation pathways.10 SOX2 is
therefore not expressed in most normal adult tissues.10–12
Moreover, aberrant reactivation of SOX2 has been detected in
~ 43% of basal-like breast cancers and in several other malignancies, including glioblastoma, lung, skin, prostate and ovarian
carcinomas.13 SOX2 overexpression in tumor specimens has been
associated with both promoter hypomethylation relative to
adjacent normal tissue and copy number ampliﬁcations.14,15 The
overexpression of SOX2 in breast cancer has been shown to
directly activate CYCLIN D1, resulting in an increased mitotic index
and proliferation.16,17 The downregulation of SOX2 by RNA
interference decreased the tumorigenic phenotype in the lung,
breast and ovarian cancers.13,16,18 However, a major limitation of
small interferin RNA and small hairpin RNA approaches in cancer
therapy has been the short half-life of small RNA or the
methylation of the virally encoded small hairpin RNA promoter,
which results in transient effects in vivo.
In light of the essential role of DNAme in the regulation of SOX2
expression we hypothesized that targeted de novo methylation in
the SOX2 promoter would result in an epigenetic 'off' switch,
forcing cancer cells to undertake differentiation programs.
Furthermore, because DNAme is read and written by endogenous
proteins and faithfully transmitted during cell division, we

reasoned that artiﬁcial incorporation of de novo DNAme in the
SOX2 promoter would confer stable oncogenic silencing, resulting
in a sustained blockade of cell growth, faithfully propagated in
successive cell generations. The forced epigenetic reprogramming
of an oncogene toward a 'normal-like' state, which will be stably
transmitted through mitosis, remains a hitherto unexplored
paradigm in cancer research; the resulting therapeutic effect
would provide durability and sustained anticancer response
(memory).
Herein we took advantage of previously characterized artiﬁcial
TFs targeting the SOX2 promoter made of six zinc ﬁnger (6ZF)
domains, recognizing 18 base pair (bp) sites in the core
promoter.17 These 6ZFs were linked to the catalytic domain of
DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), an enzyme that catalyzes de
novo DNAme, to correct the aberrant methylation state of SOX2 in
cancer cells. We show that targeted DNAme is sufﬁcient to initiate,
and even reinforce, potent and mitotically heritable silencing of
SOX2 expression. Our results indicate that the engineering of
artiﬁcial DNA-binding domains (DBDs) linked to DNMT3A can be
utilized to promote long-lasting SOX2 silencing and represents a
promising therapeutic approach to minimize tumor relapse. Our
approach could be used to promote customizable heterochromatization and epigenetic silencing of elusive cancer drivers mapped
by recent genomic projects, such as TFs and small GTPAses (RAS),
for which no drug is currently available.
RESULTS
ZF598-DNMT3A initiates SOX2 downregulation accompanied by
stable inhibition of cancer cell growth
To induce targeted DNAme in the SOX2 locus we took advantage
of our previously characterized 6ZF domains designed to
recognize 18 bps sequences in the SOX2 proximal promoter
(Figure 1a).17 Subsequently, we engineered the catalytic domain
of the human DNMT3A to the C terminus of the 6ZF domains
and in frame with a 13 amino-acid ﬂexible linker, to produce
the ZF598-DNMT3A (Figure 1a) and the ZF552-DNMT3A
(Supplementary Figure S1) constructs.19 The same 6ZF arrays
linked to the repressor super Krueppel-associated box domain
(SKD, ZF598-SKD) were used as a control, as this domain promotes
potent KAP1-dependent repression when linked at the N terminus
of the 6ZFs, without induction of DNAme.17,19
We chose the MCF7 breast cancer cells as a model cell line to
study the temporal dynamics of the incorporation of DNAme, as
these cells express high levels of SOX2, and the promoter does not
contain methylated CpG dinucleotides (Figure 2a). The 6ZF
constructs were delivered into MCF7 cells using inducible retroviral vectors17 and stable clones were isolated in which the
temporal expression of the ZF598-DNMT3A and ZF598-SKD
fusions was controlled by doxycycline (Dox) treatment.
Upon induction of the ZF598-DNMT3A and ZF598-SKD expression with Dox (+Dox), SOX2 mRNA levels decreased by 90% and
73%, respectively, as compared with control (empty vector)
transduced cells (Figure 1b). When Dox was removed for up to
8 days (~10 cell generations) from the culture media (R, Figures 1b
and c) cells transduced with ZF598-SKD restored SOX2 expression
to levels that were similar to those of uninduced cells, whereas
cells expressing the ZF598-DNMT3A showed a persistent decrease
of SOX2 expression (85% relative to uninduced cells) upon Dox
removal (Figure 1b). These ﬁndings suggested that the ZF598DNMT3A construct conferred transcriptional memory in the
targeted SOX2 locus. The SOX2 transcriptional silencing induced
by ZF598-DNMT3A was accompanied by a signiﬁcant decrease in
SOX2 protein expression. This suppression was sustained in Doxremoval conditions in the absence of expression of the ZF598DNMT3A, and even resulted in increased levels of SOX2 silencing
relative to +Dox cells as demonstrated by western blot (Figure 1c).
Oncogene (2015) 5427 – 5435

We next investigated whether the ZF598-DNMT3A fusion was
able to maintain suppression of tumor cell growth in Dox-removal
conditions. We monitored changes in cell viability over time
associated with induction and subsequent removal of the ZF
protein expression (Figure 1d). MCF7 cells stably transduced with
either empty vector control, ZF598-SKD or ZF598-DNMT3A, were
treated for 72 h with Dox to induce the expression of the ZF
proteins. Next, Dox was removed from the culture media
(Figure 1d, red arrow) and cell viability was monitored for the
next 144 h. Cells expressing empty vector or ZF598-SKD had
signiﬁcantly higher proliferation rates upon Dox removal as
compared with ZF598-DNMT3A transduced cells, which retained
a more robust inhibition of cell proliferation after Dox removal.
These results demonstrate the unique capacity of the 6ZFDNMT3A fusions to establish an oncogenic silencing state at both
the mRNA and protein level that was stably maintained through
cell generations.
ZF598-DNMT3A silences SOX2 by initiation and faithful
propagation of DNAme
We subsequently investigated whether ZF598-DNMT3A was able
to catalyze targeted de novo DNAme in the SOX2 promoter. MCF7
cells stably transduced with ZF598-DNMT3A were treated with
Dox to induce the expression of the ZF598-DNMT3A. Next, cells
were either harvested at 72 h or removed from Dox and passaged
for 8 additional days in Dox-free conditions. These Dox-removal
conditions completely suppressed the expression of the ZF
protein, as determined by western blotting of nuclear extracts
using an anti-HA antibody (Figure 1c).
Conventional sodium bisulﬁte sequencing was ﬁrst conducted
to quantify the incorporation of DNAme in the amplicon containing the ZF598-DNMT3A binding site (Amplicon II, Figure 1a). Doxinduced expression of ZF598-DNMT3A resulted in an increase of
DNAme of up to 90% at speciﬁc CpG dinucleotides (Figure 2a). The
incorporation of DNAme was also validated by MassARRAY
analysis (Figures 2b and d). Control cells or cells expressing the
catalytic mutant ZF598-DNMT3A-E74A revealed no increase of
CpG methylation, demonstrating that the induction of DNAme
required the catalytic activity linked to the ZF598. Similar results
were obtained utilizing a second ZF protein (ZF552-DNMT3A)
targeting an 18 bps region 552 bps upstream of the translation
start site (Supplementary Figure S1), which demonstrates
that the approach is generalizable for other DBDs targeting
SOX2. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of the catalytic domain
of DNMT3A (untargeted DNMT3A) lacking the SOX2-speciﬁc DBDs
resulted in an unspeciﬁc background incorporation of DNAme
(Supplementary Figure S1). The untargeted construct was not
capable of downregulating SOX2 messenger RNA levels or to
induce proliferative arrest. Furthermore, when the DNMT3A was
linked to 6ZF DBDs speciﬁc for the MASPIN tumor suppressor gene
context, instead of an oncogenic context, targeted methylation
was observed in the MASPIN promoter accompanied by an
increase in cell proliferation.19 Reciprocally, no changes in DNAme
were observed in the MASPIN promoter context with the SOX2speciﬁc DBDs linked to DNMT3A (Supplementary Figure S2). These
results indicated that the approach required two functional
components, the targeting DBD and a catalytically active DNMT3A
domain.
Importantly, the de novo pattern of CpG methylation initiated
by ZF598-DNMT3A in the SOX2 promoter was stably and faithfully
maintained over several cell generations in vitro, even 8 days after
Dox removal (Figure 2b) when the expression of the targeted
methyltransferase was not longer detectable by immunoblotting.
Furthermore, both the pattern and intensity of the induced
methylation (40–90% depending on the speciﬁc CpG nucleotide)
were maintained over the time course of the experiment.

stably transduced with empty vector, ZF598-SKD and ZF598-DNMT3A. The expression of the ZF fusion was controlled by addition or

(+Dox) or removed from Dox and subcultured for 8 days and processed for western blot. Error bars represent standard deviation (s.d.)
(***P o 0.001, **P o0.01, *P o0.05). (c) Detection of SOX2 by western blot. The C-terminal Hemagglutinin (HA) tag was used for
immunodetection of the ZF proteins. An anti-histone H3 antibody was used as loading control. (d) Cell viability of MCF7 cells assessed by Cell
TiterGlo assays. Empty vector, ZF598-SKD and ZF598-DNMT3A-transduced cells were induced with Dox for 48 h and removed from Dox after
72 h (red arrow). P-values between empty vector and ZF598-DNMT3A and between ZF598-SKD and ZF598-DNMT3A were P o0.001 and
Po0.05 respectively, at 144 h.

To evaluate the spreading of DNAme in the SOX2 locus after the
initial induction, we analyzed two additional amplicons (amplicon
I and III) ﬂanking the 6ZF-binding site, encompassing ~ 1 kbps upand downstream of the translation start site (Figures 2c and d).
Sequencing analysis of amplicon I (−1069 to − 623 bps upstream
of the translation start site) demonstrated an increase of DNAme
upon ZF598-DNMT3A expression as compared with the MCF7
empty vector transduced cell line or ZF598-DNMT3A-E74Atransduced cells. The frequencies of DNAme in amplicon I were
signiﬁcantly higher than those immediately adjacent to the ZFbinding site, suggesting that DNAme was possibly spread and
even reinforced in the ﬂanking regions. Most importantly, after
discontinuation of the ZF598-DNMT3A expression (Dox removal),
the de novo methylation additionally increased up to 97% at
speciﬁc CpG sites in Amplicon I (Figure 1c).
As last, the MassARRAY analysis of DNAme in amplicon III (+695
to +1055 bps downstream of the translation start site, Figure 2d)
revealed no methylation in MCF7 control and ZF598-DNMT3A cells
in the absence of Dox. Upon ZF598-DNMT3A expression (+Dox)
CpG methylation increased up to 80%, and no DNAme was
induced in cells expressing the ZF598-DNMT3A-E74A mutant. Our
time-course analysis suggests that the de novo DNAme induced by
the artiﬁcial methyltransferase results in both, a phase of induction
of gene silencing upon Dox induction, and a phase of
maintenance and reinforcement of silencing (Dox removal), which
© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited

could be associated with propagation or spreading of DNAme
further away from the 6ZF site during DNA replication. These
results further support the increased downregulation of SOX2
expression after Dox removal previously observed by quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot
analysis and outline the importance of CpG dinucleotides ﬂanking
the core promoter for the regulation of SOX2 expression.
ZF598-DNMT3A expression confers anticancer memory and
reduces tumor growth in a breast cancer xenograft in NUDE mice
To analyze whether the ZF598-DNMT3A construct induced
phenotypic memory in vivo we took advantage of our inducible
MCF7 cell lines stably transduced with either the catalytically
active ZF598-DNMT3A or the empty vector control. A total of
2 × 106 MCF7 cells transduced with either ZF598-DNMT3A or
control were implanted into the ﬂank of NUDE mice and allowed
to grow for 22 days before switching the animals to a Doxcontaining diet (Figure 3a). Within each group N = 5 animals were
maintained in a Dox-free diet. At day 19 post induction, half of the
ZF598-DNMT3A injected animals from the +Dox group were
removed from the Dox diet (N = 10), to withdraw the expression of
the ZF methyltransferase (R). In contrast with ZF598-DNMT3A,
catalytic dead ZF598-DNMT3A-E74A mutant cells failed to reduce

mice (Supplementary Figure S3).
Over the period of 43 days, a signiﬁcant inhibition (P = 0.0001)
of tumor growth was detected in animals injected with ZF598DNMT3A receiving a Dox-containing diet (Figure 3b, right panel),
which was superior to the inhibition we have reported for
Krueppel-associated box-containing repressors.17 Furthermore,
this reduction of tumor growth was maintained up to 72 days
after Dox induction (P = 0.001). Importantly, two animals induced
with the ZF598-DNMT3A construct had completely regressed
tumor burden and could not be detected by caliper measurements. As expected, no signiﬁcant change in tumor growth was
detected in animals injected with empty vector (Figures 3b and c,
left panel).

(Dox-removal group), while maintaining the other half under +Dox
conditions. These groups allowed us to investigate whether the
tumor growth inhibition mediated by SOX2 methylation was
stably transmitted even after removal of ZF598-DNMT3A expression. Tumor volumes in the Dox-free, Dox-induced and Doxremoval groups were monitored for 43 days post induction, equal
to 24 days post removal of Dox for the Dox-removal group
(Figure 3c, right panel). The tumor volumes of ZF598-DNMT3A
+Dox animals demonstrated a signiﬁcant inhibition relative to
ZF598-DNMT3A − Dox animals (P = 0.0001). Furthermore, mice
removed from a Dox diet maintained a signiﬁcant reduction of
tumor burden (P = 0.004) relative to uninduced animals (Figure 3c,
right panel). It should be noted that the tumor sizes of mice
removed from Dox slowly increased over time when compared
with animals continuously placed under +Dox conditions. However, this effect could be due to the positive selection of cells

+Dox and Dox-removal tumors was extracted at the indicated time points and subjected to sodium bisulﬁte conversion, followed by
MassARRAY to detect DNA methylation frequencies. The amplicon I is located −1069 to − 623 bps upstream of the translation start site. Each

functional compensation by another oncogenic driver.
To verify that the reduction of tumor growth in the ZF598DNMT3A +Dox animals was associated with the incorporation of
DNAme, MassARRAY analysis of tumor DNA was performed at
different time points post induction (Figure 4). DNA samples
extracted from empty vector +Dox tumors at 29 days post induction
were used as control. Upon induction of ZF598-DNMT3A expression
an increase of DNAme was detected at all time points of sampling
relative to control. The comparison of meCpG frequencies in the
SOX2 amplicon I at day 43 post induction indicated that the majority
of CpG dinucleotides were signiﬁcantly more methylated in the
ZF598-DNMT3A +Dox and Dox-removal tumors over the ZF598DNMT3A − Dox tumors sampled in the experiment (Supplementary
Figure S4 and Supplementary Table S1). Importantly, this
methylation was maintained in vivo for more than 50 days after
Dox removal in all samples analyzed. These data clearly demonstrated that the targeted DNAme was associated with tumor growth
inhibition and with a signiﬁcant decrease in the rate of tumor
relapse when the treatment was discontinued.

Immunoﬂuorescence analysis of tumor sections revealed
nuclear expression of the ZF598-DNMT3A protein in the +Dox
group, but no observable signal in ZF598-DNMT3A − Dox animals
(Figure 5b). This induction of methyltransferase expression
correlated with a signiﬁcant decrease in SOX2 expression in the
tumors that received Dox, which was not observed in control
(empty vector ± Dox) and ZF598-DNMT3A − Dox tumors. After
removal of Dox, the ZF598-DNMT3A expression was not longer
detected in the tumor sections. Importantly, a decrease of SOX2
expression was stably maintained in vivo after Dox removal
relative to control or − Dox tumors. In addition, the downregulation of SOX2 expression correlated with a decrease in tumor
cell proliferation, as indicated by the Ki-67 marker, which was
maintained downregulated relative to uninduced cells even after
removal of ZF598-DNMT3A expression for 10 days (Figure 5b).
These results suggest that the de novo methylation patterns were
robustly maintained during somatic cell division in vivo resulting
in a remarkable phenotypic change of the tumor cells, suggesting
loss of some mesenchymal features and gain of some epitheliallike features.

Breast tumor growth inhibition was maintained upon clearance of
ZF598-DNMT3A expression
To examine changes in the tumor morphology, Hematoxylin and
Eosin staining was performed on sections of empty vector control
and ZF598-DNMT3A tumors. The control tumors were collected
29 days post induction, the ZF598-DNMT3A tumors were
continuously induced with Dox for 72 days and for the ZF598DNMT3A Dox-removal tumors, Dox was withdrawn for 53 days
after an initial induction of 19 days. Histological analysis of empty
vector +Dox tumor sections revealed a high density of closely
packed tumor cells at day 29 post induction (Figure 5a, left panel).
In contrast, the ZF598-DNMT3A +Dox tumors exhibited a very
striking change in the tumor architecture, with a more organized
structure consisting of islands of tumor cells and an increase of
intervening stroma, a phenotype that was maintained after
removal of ZF598-DNMT3A expression (Figure 5a). In the analyzed
tumors, this change in the tumor phenotype was accompanied
with the signiﬁcant downregulation of some mesenchymal
markers, such as SOX2, TWIST1 and Vimentin and a signiﬁcant
upregulation of some epithelial junction proteins such as Claudin 4
as assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (Supplementary Figure S5).

DISCUSSION
Promoter CpG methylation has an important role in controlling
gene transcription and therefore contributes to the regulation of
many biological processes. In cancer, aberrant DNAme is
associated with initiation and progression of malignant disease.
Like TFs, many oncogenic drivers in cancer are of undruggable
nature, such as the small GTPases KRAS and HRAS. Therefore, the
ability to program a heritable targeted silencing state in such
major oncogenic drivers would be a high impact accomplishment
with far reaching clinical implications for cancer treatment.
Targeted DNAme by designer ZFs linked to the catalytic domain
of DNA methyltransferases has been recently demonstrated by
our group and others.19–25 We have previously shown that
engineered 6ZFs binding the MASPIN tumor suppressor promoter
linked to DNMT3A induced targeted DNAme in the promoter, and
that the resulting phenotypic effect of these proteins was the
activation of cancer cell growth.19 Here, we demonstrated that
DNAme targeted to the SOX2 oncogenic promoter via 6ZF
domains linked to DNMT3A was associated with a signiﬁcant
inhibition of tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of breast
cancer. We took advantage of two different 6ZF proteins
engineered to bind SOX2 promoter (ZF598 and ZF552)26 and

45 days after Dox removal. Pictures were taken at × 20 and a detail of the image is shown. (b) Immunoﬂuorescence on sections of empty

demonstrated that both proteins catalyzed the incorporation of
DNAme and induced potent cell growth arrest. This effect was
dependent on both a functional DBD and the catalytic function of
DNMT3A, as an untargeted DNMT3A construct or the expression
of a catalytic mutant resulted in an unspeciﬁc background
incorporation of DNAme, which was not capable of silencing
SOX2 or inhibit cell growth. Furthermore, de novo DNAme was
stably maintained in vivo even 53 days after removal of the ZF598DNMT3A and was accompanied with a sustained suppression of
SOX2 expression and tumor growth inhibition. It is important to
note that the absence of expression of the methyltransferase

upon long-term removal of Dox was carefully validated using
immunoblotting and immunoﬂuorescence.
In this study, we utilized modular ZF proteins engineered to
bind an 18-bp sequence in the core promoter of SOX2. ZFs are
well-characterized DBDs and have been used for almost two
decades for DNA targeting with customizable sequence
selectivity.27 Furthermore, recent novel approaches to target
endogenous gene expression also hold great promise such as
transcription activator-like effectors28,29 and the RNA-guided
clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (Cas)
system.30,31 Both transcription activator-like effectors and Cas9

could be similarly used as alternatives to ZFs to target the catalytic
active domain of DNMT3A to speciﬁc chromosomal sites.
Pioneering work has been recently published by Konermann
et al.32 who fused 32 different histone effector domains to a
transcription activator-like effector DBD targeting the Neurog2
locus and demonstrated transcriptional repression. However,
the spatio-temporal dynamics associated with de novo DNAme
and histone post-transcriptional modiﬁcations still remain
elusive. Here we demonstrate that de novo DNAme is faithfully
transmitted after clearance of expression of the 6ZF-DNMT3A
fusions. The artiﬁcial incorporation of DNAme provides an
initial platform, which is read, written and propagated by
endogenous methylation machinery during DNA replication. The
complex between DNMT1, UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like PHD (containing
plant homeodomain) and RING (really interesting new gene)
ﬁnger domains 1) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) at
the replication fork could mediate the cross-talk between
methylated DNA and repressive histone modiﬁcations.33,34 In our
experiments, it is conceivable that such mechanisms could be
responsible for the maintenance of DNAme and the downregulation of SOX2.35
In addition to hereditable transmission during mitosis, we
observed that the de novo methylation in the SOX2 locus was
expanded at least 1 Kbp away from the targeted site. Potential
mechanisms could involve the endogenous spreading of DNAme
for example by chromatin looping or iterative reading and writing
of DNA and histone post-transcriptional modiﬁcations,36 or by
low-frequency occupancy of these sites by the 6ZF domains. In
this regard, it will be interesting to investigate whether this effect
is also observed with more recently developed engineering
approaches such as transcription activator-like effectors or
clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats/dCas9.
In contrast with DNMT3A, cells expressing the ZF-SKD fusions
did not sustain a stable downregulation of SOX2, indicating
mechanistically distinct epigenetic processes initiated by the
ZF-DNMT3A and ZF-SKD constructs. SKD mediates silencing of
target genes through recruitment of KAP1 (Krueppel-associated
protein 1), which acts as a scaffold for heterochromatin-inducing
modiﬁers such as HP1 and methyltransferase SETDB1.36 However,
unlike DNMT3A, SKD has no intrinsic enzymatic activity, and
mainly carries a recruiting activity. In our study, the suppression of
SKD expression did not result in epigenetic memory.
To date, four epigenetic drugs have been approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration, including two DNMT and two
HDAC inhibitors37 to reactivate aberrantly silenced tumor
suppressor genes. Here we report a novel strategy that will
enable the silencing of aberrantly expressed oncogenes. We have
previously demonstrated systemic delivery of lipid-protamine-RNA
nanoparticles encapsulating mRNA encoding a ZF protein
upregulating the MASPIN promoter for the treatment of serous
ovarian cancer.38 Such lipid-protamine-RNA technology could
be similarly adapted to deliver the ZF-DNMT3A constructs for
stable heterochromatization of SOX2. The small, compact
molecular architecture of ZF domains and their lack of immunogenicity make them very suitable molecular scaffolds for this type
of delivery.
In summary, we demonstrate the applicability of DBD-DNMT3A
fusions to induce targeted DNAme to stably repress oncogenic
expression in a long-term xenograft mouse model of breast
cancer. This approach could be extended to many other
oncogenic drivers for which no drug is currently available to
promote potent and durable cancer cell growth inhibition. In
addition to its important implications in cancer therapeutics, our
approach provides a platform to induce targeted DNAme and
investigate the temporal and spatial propagation of this epigenetic state and its effects on gene expression on a genomic level
in vivo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of stable cell lines
The construction of the SKD, DNMT3A, DNMT3A-E74A and the 6ZF
domains has been described elsewhere.17,19 ZF598-DNMT3A and ZF598DNMT3A-E74A were cloned into pRetroX-Tight-Pur (CloneTech, Mountain
View, CA, USA). Generation of MCF7 cells stably expressing ZF598-DNMT3A
and ZF598-DNMT3A-E74A was performed as described.17 Cells were
induced with Dox every 48 h and either harvested at 72 h after the ﬁrst
induction (+Dox) or removed from Dox and subcultured for 8 days and
processed for western blot.

Cell proliferation assays
Eighteen replicates of MCF7 cells stably expressing empty vector, ZF598SKD and ZF598-DNMT3A were plated in 96-wells plates (1000 cells/well).
Twelve replicates were induced with Dox at time point 0 and after 48 h.
After 72 h, six replicates were removed from Dox, whereas six replicates
were continuously induced. Cell proliferation was assessed by CellTiterGlo
assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) every 24 h for a total period of 144 h.39
Results were normalized to readings at day 0.

Bisulﬁte conversion and MassARRAY methylation analysis
After genomic DNA extraction, 2 μg of sample DNA (derived from either
cell line or tumor) was treated with sodium bisulﬁte using the EZ DNA
Methylation-Direct Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). We custom
designed primers for three amplicons spanning the core SOX2 promoter,
one speciﬁcally including the 6ZF-binding site 5′-gGCCCCCTCCTCC
CCCGGC-3′ and two amplicons up- and downstream of the 6ZF-binding
site. Polymerase chain reaction was then carried out on 5–10 ng of sodium
bisulﬁte converted sample DNA using conversion-speciﬁc primers. For
amplicon I: forward primer 5′-aggaagagagGGATAGAGGTTTGGGTTTTTTAA
TTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-cagtaatacgactcactatagggagaaggctAAACCAAC
CTACCAACCACTAAAA-3′. For amplicon II: forward primer 5′-aggaagagag
AAAGGTTTTTTAGTGGTTGGTAGGT-3′ and 5′-agtaatacgactcactatagggag
aaggctAAAACTCAAACTTCTCTCCCTTTCT-3′ reverse primer. For amplicon
III: 5′-aggaagagagTTTTGGTATGGTTTTTGGTTTTATG-3′ forward primer
and 5′-cagtaatacgactcactatagggagaaggctAATTTTCTCCATACTATTTCTTACT
CTCC-3′ reverse primer with lower case letters representing the T7 tag
sequences. Percent SOX2 DNAme was quantiﬁed using mass spectrometry
with the SEQUENOM EpiTYPER T complete reagent kit (San Diego, CA,
USA). Conventional sodium bisulﬁte-sequencing analysis was carried out as
described before using 5′-AAAGGTTTTTTAGTGGTTGGTAGGT-3′ forward
primer and 5′-AAAACTCAAACTTCTCTCCCTTTCT-3′ reverse primer for
polymerase chain reaction ampliﬁcation of bisulﬁte converted DNA.19

Mouse experiments
Female NUDE mice (age 4 weeks) were purchased from Taconic Farms
(Hudson, NY, USA) and housed under pathogen-free conditions. The
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill approved all experiments described herein.
Estrogen pellets containing 2 mg 17β-Estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.,
St Louis, MO, USA) and 8 mg Cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) were
subcutaneously implanted in the animals 7 days prior of the injection of
the cells. MCF7 cells (2 × 106) were collected and resuspended with
matrigel (BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) 1:1 volume ratio in a total
volume of 100 ml. The cell–matrigel mixture was injected into the mouse
ﬂank of N = 11 mice for empty vector and N = 22 for ZF598-DNMT3A.
Tumor growth was monitored by caliper twice a week. When the tumor
reached a size of ~ 25–30 mm3, Dox was administered to the mice in the
form of green food pellets (200 mg/kg of mice chow) for a period of
19 days. At day 19 post induction half of the animals of each group were
removed from Dox, whereas the other half was maintained under Dox diet.
During the entire experiment, the mice weight was monitored to ensure
absence of toxicity. Animals were killed when tumor reached 100 mm3
(empty vector 29 days post induction, ZF598-DNMT3A upon Dox removal
(‘No Dox’) for 43 days post induction and ZF598-DNMT3A Dox removal at
72 days post induction). Statistical differences between control and
ZF-DNMT3A animals were assessed by Wilcoxon Ranks Sum Test analysis.
