Abstract
Reversibly switchable proteins are powerful tools with which to explore protein function in vitro
and in vivo. For example, the activity of many proteins fused to the hormone-binding domain of
the modified estrogen receptor (ERTAM) can be regulated by provision or removal of 4hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Despite the widespread use of ERTAM fusions in vivo, inadequate
data are available as to the most efficacious routes for systemic tamoxifen delivery. In this study,
we have used two well-characterised ERTAM fusion proteins, both reversibly activated by 4-OHT,
to compare the effectiveness and kinetics of 4-OHT delivery in mice in vivo by either tamoxifen in
food or by intraperitoneal injection. Our data indicate that dietary tamoxifen offers an effective,
facile and ethically preferable means for long term activation of ERTAM fusion proteins in vivo.

Introduction
In classical mouse genetics, the function of a specific gene is irreversibly mutated or deleted
in the germ line and the phenotype that manifests is an amalgam of both, the direct
consequences of the mutation together with the extent to which those direct consequences
drive compensatory adaptation during development. Such developmental compensation,
together with the embryonic lethality associated with other mutations, severely limits the
information that such “germ-line” genetics can provide on the roles played by genes in adult
tissues. The inability to reverse the germ-line alterations of genes in classical genetics
further limits determination of adult gene function. Such considerations have fostered the
idea of using reversibly switchable genetic technologies, whereby wild type gene functions

When fused to a heterologous protein, the modified estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain
(ERTAM) may be used to render that protein rapidly and reversibly ectopically regulatable
by the ERTAM ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), see http://www.picard.ch/downloads
for annotated list of proteins that have successfully been regulated by fusion with a steroid
binding domain. Most notably, ERTAM fusions with various oncoproteins and tumour
suppressor proteins have been successfully employed in transgenic and knock-in mouse
cancer models to ascertain the roles of such effectors in both tumour initiation and
maintenance1-4. However, the efficiency of tamoxifen delivery and activation of ERTAM
fusion proteins has hitherto only been assessed for “hit-and-run” activation functions, such
as activation of Cre-ERTAM by determining the extent of recombination of specific floxed
alleles 8-10. However, such acute studies offer little guidance as to the practical utility of
tamoxifen administration in sustaining the activities of ERTAM fusion proteins over
protracted periods in vivo, as is required for modelling chronic pathologies such as cancer
that typically requires long-term administration of ERTAM ligand to sustain activities of
oncogenic ERTAM-fusion proteins. For such purposes, 4-OHT is prohibitively expensive
and, consequently, most in vivo studies instead use tamoxifen, which is cheaper and is
readily metabolized by the liver into the active 4-OHT metabolite by the cytochrome P450
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 isoforms 5. Unfortunately, tamoxifen has a relatively short half-life
in vivo (about 16 hours)6 and is poorly soluble in aqueous preparations so, to date, the most
consistent results for sustained activation of ERTAM fusion proteins have been obtained
through daily intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of tamoxifen dispersed in vegetable oil 7.
However, administration via this route is both labour-intensive and ethically debatable
because it can result in sterile peritonitis due to the accumulation of oil. Indeed, six weeks of
daily injections is the maximum that can be realistically tolerated therefore extended
treatment with tamoxifen is usually impractical. Despite the widespread use of ERTAM
fusions in vivo, scant data are available on the most efficacious routes for long-term
tamoxifen delivery. We therefore sought to ascertain the kinetics of tamoxifen-induced
activation of ERTAM-fusion proteins in response to various routes of tamoxifen
administration and to investigate more sustainable tamoxifen delivery methods for long-term
analysis.

Results and Discussion
We employed two well-characterised mouse models whose biologies are dependent upon
activities of ERTAM fusion proteins. First, the pIns-MycERTAM mouse, in which transgenic
overexpression of the 4-OHT-dependent allele of the c-Myc oncoprotein, MycERTAM, is
driven from the rat insulin promoter in pancreatic β cells. Administration of tamoxifen to
such animals activates oncogenic Myc, triggering widespread Myc-induced β cell apoptosis
and islet involution. However, co-expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in β cells
blocks Myc-induced apoptosis, whereupon Myc activation drives and maintains
synchronous, rapid, persistent and progressive β cell expansion accompanied by
angiogenesis, inflammation, invasion and tumourigenesis 11. Subsequent de-activation of
MycERTAM triggers complete regression of the β cell tumours. Second, we used

Trp53tm1Gev mice (hereafter called p53KI/KI) in which both copies of endogenous p53 are
replaced by a gene encoding the 4-OHT-dependent p53 allele p53ERTAM 4. In these
animals, p53 function is continuously dependent upon the provision of 4-OHT ligand.
Hence, in the absence of tamoxifen p53KI/KI mice are effectively p53 null and radiosensitive
tissues, such as thymus, spleen and intestinal epithelium, exhibit significant refractoriness to
radiation-induced apoptosis, as they do in p53−/− mice. However, p53-dependent
radiosensitivity of p53KI/KI tissues is rapidly restored upon systemic administration of
tamoxifen 4.
To assess whether dietary tamoxifen is a feasible means for regulating ERTAM protein
activity in vivo, we first assessed the dynamics of oncogenic MycERTAM activation in pInsMycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL mice (also known as Tg(Ins-BCL2L1)2Ksp;Tg(Ins-MYC/Er)1Gev
mice) 11. Myc-driven pancreatic insulinomas were induced in 8- to 15-week-old pInsMycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL (n≥3) mice by either daily i.p. of 0.8 mg tamoxifen in oil or dietary
tamoxifen for 7 days. β cell proliferation in pancreata was then assessed by
immunohistochemical staining for the proliferative marker Ki67. Control RIP7-Bcl-xL mice
exhibited little β cell proliferation (<0.4 Ki67 positive cells per unit area) irrespective of
tamoxifen delivery or route of administration. By contrast, administration of tamoxifen to
pIns-MycERTAM;RIP7-Bcl-xL mice, by either injection or diet, elicited similarly dramatic
levels of β cell proliferation (P= 0.85, Figure 1), indicating that MycERTAM-activating doses
of tamoxifen are achievable by both administration methods. Hence, administration of
tamoxifen through diet is an effective means for achieving ERTAM-activating levels of 4OHT in tissues in vivo.

To establish the kinetics and persistence of tamoxifen-dependent activation of ERTAM
proteins in tissues in vivo, we used the p53KI/KI mouse model, assessing 4-OHT-dependent
p53 functionality using responses of radiosensitive tissues to pathological doses of γirradiation. Tamoxifen was administered to 8-12-week-old homozygous p53KI/KI mice (and
to p53+/+ and p53−/− controls) by either (i) single intraperitoneal bolus of 1 mg tamoxifen
dissolved in oil or by feeding mice with tamoxifen-impregnated food for (ii) 24 hours or (iii)
7 days. Mice were then exposed to 2.5 Gy whole body γ-irradiation (Cs source) at various
times after bolus tamoxifen administration or after removal from tamoxifenized food, and
thymus and spleen collected 4 hours later. p53 functionality was assessed by quantifying
apoptosis in the thymus (immunohistochemical staining for cleaved caspase-3) (Figure 2 A
to C) and by assaying levels of p21cip1 expression in the spleen (Supplemental Figure 1).
As expected, untreated p53+/+ control mice exhibited high levels of both apoptosis and
p21cip1 expression following irradiation whereas non-tamoxifen-treated p53KI/KI mice (as
well as p53−/− controls), exhibited little (Supplemental Figure 2). Significant apoptosis and
p21cip1 expression were evident in the radiosensitive tissues of p53KI/KI within only 2 hours
of i.p. administration of 1 mg tamoxifen, peaking around 4 hours post injection and then
falling back to background levels between 24-48 hours post treatment. Hence, tamoxifen
adminstered i.p. rapidly and systemically restores functionality to p53ERTAM tissues in vivo.
Attenuation of radiosensitivity was more rapid (50% reduction in p21cip1 expression by 8
hours post irradiation) in mice given a single i.p. injection of a reduced (0.8 mg) tamoxifen
dose (estimated to be equivalent to the dose received via chow, see below) whereas a higher

dose (4 mg) elicited a more sustained p53ERTAM functionality (more than 80% of peak
p21cip1 expression was maintained to 8 hours post irradiation). However, higher doses of
tamoxifen did not increase the extent of p21cip1 activation at 2 hours post-irradiation
(Supplementary Figure 3A), indicating that the level of p53 activation is directly dependant
on tamoxifen availability and that tamoxifen doses via i.p. greater than 0.8 mg tamoxifen are
fully saturating for p53ERTAM in vivo and that higher doses merely confer more prolonged
ERTAM fusion protein activity.
We next investigated the kinetics of ERTAM activation when delivery tamoxifen through
food. p53KI/KI mice exposed to tamoxifen-containing food for 24 hours exhibited no
measurable increase radiosensitivity. This is most likely due to the fact that over the first 24
hour period mice only ate on average 2.3 g of tamoxifen containing food (n=14, range 1-3
g), which is around half of their normal daily intake and, consequently, exhibited on average
8.5 % weight loss (n=14, range 0-19 %). We guess that the level of tamoxifen in the animals
is insufficient to activate p53ERTAM and, for this reason, dietary tamoxifen is unsuitable for
studies requiring acute activation of ERTAM proteins. However, tissues of p53KI/KI mice
exposed to tamoxifen-containing food for 7 days was sufficient to render tissues fully
radiosensitive, as evidenced by extensive radiation-induced apoptosis and p21cip1 expression
that then fell to background levels by 16 to 24 hours of surcease of dietary tamoxifen
(Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1C). The actual DNA damage induced by γ-irradiation,
as assessed by phospho-Histone H2A.X staining, was comparable in all tissues irrespective
of tamoxifen provision (Supplementary Figure 3B).

To examine directly the rate of metabolism/excretion of tamoxifen in each experimental
system, we determined the level of 4-OHT, the ERTAM-activating tamoxifen metabolite, in
the blood plasma of pure C57BL6J mice (Supplementary Figure 4) using liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC/MS). These studies confirmed that plasma 4-OHT
is evident 2 hours post single i.p. administration of 0.8 mg tamoxifen, returning to
background levels after 24-48 hours. Sustained dietary administration of tamoxifencontaining food for 7 days resulted in significant plasma 4-OHT and this fell to undetectable
levels between 8 and 24 hours after surcease of dietary tamoxifen. Thus 4-OHT, once
tamoxifen has been ingested or injected, is cleared from tissues within 24 hours, attesting to
the need for repeated daily administration of tamoxifen in situations to maintain ERTAM
fusion protein function. Once animals have become acclimatised to dietary tamoxifen for at
least 7 days they receive on average a 0.8 mg daily dose of tamoxifen over a 24 hour period
from grazing on food. This is reflected in the observation that 4-OHT levels and
corresponding functional readout of ERTAM protein activity is lower than seen via a single 1
mg i.p. injection and decays to background levels rather more rapidly. Nonetheless, we
guess that tamoxifen delivery via the food maintains more consistent ER fusion activity than
can periodic i.p. delivery. Of note, in this study we used either a mixed 129-C57BL6/J or
pure C57BL6/J mouse strains - although we have not observed any strain-dependent
differences in tamoxifen availability this remains a possibility that should be considered in
further in vivo studies using switchable ER-fusion proteins.
To investigate the possibility of any adverse impact on general health through long-term
administration of tamoxifen in food, mice were placed on a tamoxifenized diet for 18 weeks.

Over the first week, mice lost an average of 16% body weight, apparently due to aphagia,
but then recovered normal body weight and thereafter remained healthy, with no
abnormalities detectable in any tissues (Figure 2D). Given the hazards associated with
repeated i.p. injection, our data confirm administration of tamoxifen in food as an effective
and ethically preferable means of maintaining ERTAM activity for prolonged periods in vivo.
