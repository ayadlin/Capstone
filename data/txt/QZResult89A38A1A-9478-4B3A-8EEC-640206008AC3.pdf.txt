Abstract

Introduction

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an approved therapeutic
procedure that exerts cytotoxic activity toward tumor cells
by inducing production of reactive oxygen species such as
singlet oxygen. PDT leads to oxidative damage of cellular
macromolecules, including proteins that undergo multiple
modifications such as fragmentation, cross-linking, and
carbonylation that result in protein unfolding and aggregation. Because the major mechanism for elimination of
carbonylated proteins is their degradation by proteasomes,
we hypothesized that a combination of PDT with proteasome
inhibitors might lead to accumulation of carbonylated
proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), aggravated ER stress,
and potentiated cytotoxicity toward tumor cells. We observed
that Photofrin-mediated PDT leads to robust carbonylation of
cellular proteins and induction of unfolded protein response.
Pretreatment of tumor cells with three different proteasome
inhibitors, including bortezomib, MG132, and PSI, gave
increased accumulation of carbonylated and ubiquitinated
proteins in PDT-treated cells. Proteasome inhibitors effectively sensitized tumor cells of murine (EMT6 and C-26) as well as
human (HeLa) origin to PDT-mediated cytotoxicity. Significant retardation of tumor growth with 60% to 100% complete
responses was observed in vivo in two different murine tumor
models (EMT6 and C-26) when PDT was combined with either
bortezomib or PSI. Altogether, these observations indicate
that combination of PDT with proteasome inhibitors leads to
potentiated antitumor effects. The results of these studies are
of immediate clinical application because bortezomib is a
clinically approved drug that undergoes extensive clinical
evaluations for the treatment of solid tumors. [Cancer Res
2009;69(10):4235–43]

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, in particular, singlet oxygen
(1O2) are responsible for the cytotoxic effects induced by
photodynamic therapy (PDT; refs. 1, 2). 1O2 reacts with proteins,
lipids, and DNA (3–7). Radical-induced protein modifications
include fragmentation, multimerization, misfolding, and/or structural alterations, resulting in functional inactivation, changes in
mechanical properties, aggregation, formation of further reactive
species, or accelerated degradation (8).
Multiple mechanisms have evolved to interact with oxidants to
form less reactive products. These include enzymes that directly
react with ROS such as superoxide dismutases, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and a number of secondary scavengers participating in the reduction of oxidized biomolecules. However, during
robust oxidative stress conditions, such as those occurring during
PDT, these cytoprotective mechanisms are insufficient and a
significant damage to cellular constituents may ensue. Therefore,
other mechanisms have developed to enable restoration of normal
protein function within cells. Oxidized proteins, which lose their
physiologic function due to conformational changes, can be
refolded by molecular chaperones such as heat shock proteins
(HSP). Notably, PDT was found to induce expression of a variety of
HSPs including HS1, HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, GRP78, and
GRP94, and for some of these proteins a protective role in PDTtreated cells has been shown (9–13). Inefficient restoration of
protein structure that leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins
within endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is called ER stress (14).
ER stress triggers several independent adaptive responses
collectively referred to as unfolded protein response (UPR). Its
function is to reestablish protein homeostasis and normal ER
function. UPR triggers at least three signaling pathways: activation
of protein kinase RNA–like ER kinase, activating transcription
factor 6, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (15). Activation of
inositol-requiring enzyme 1 leads to unusual cytosolic splicing of
mRNA for X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), which on translation
produces sXBP-1, an active transcription factor. UPR-induced
genes encode chaperones (including numerous HSPs), enzymes
that participate in red-ox reactions and management of oxidative
stress, and genes for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). ERAD
involves the retrograde translocation of unfolded proteins from the
lumen of the ER to the cytosol, where they undergo degradation

in proteasomes (16). The latter are large multisubunit protease
complexes endowed with three main proteolytic activities: trypsinlike, chymotrypsin-like, and caspase-like (17, 18). Excessive ER
stress or a failure of UPR to counteract it can trigger cell death.
One of the typical biomarkers for oxidative protein damage is
carbonylation. Carbonylation leads to exposure of hydrophobic
patches within proteins, resulting in their partial unfolding,
which favors their ubiquitination followed by recognition and
degradation by proteasomes (19). The ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS) has been shown to play an important cytoprotective role through degradation of oxidatively modified proteins
(19, 20). Robust carbonylation of proteins results in the
formation of large protein aggregates or ‘‘aggresomes,’’ which
entrap elements of the UPS, decreasing the cellular capacity of
proteasomal proteolysis (21). Treatment with proteasome inhibitors is also associated with formation of intracellular protein
aggregates, increased ER stress, and UPR induction in different
tumor models (22, 23).
It was previously shown that PDT with purpurin-18 induces
protein carbonylation in tumor cells (24). However, the fate of
carbonylated proteins in tumor cells has not been investigated.
Therefore, we decided to study the proteasome-mediated degradation of PDT-induced protein carbonyls to better understand
the mechanisms of PDT-mediated cytotoxicity and to find out
whether inhibition of this degradation would affect the antitumor
effects of PDT.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cells. Human cervical cancer (HeLa) and murine breast
carcinoma (EMT6) cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. Murine colon adenocarcinoma (C-26) was obtained from
Dr. Danuta Dus (Institute of Immunology and Experimental Medicine,
Wroclaw, Poland). HeLa cells stably expressing HA-tagged yCD3, HA-tagged
aTCR, a1-antitrypsin Hong Kong mutant (a1AT), and UbG76VGFP were
used. Expression plasmids encoding reporter substrates were obtained from
Dr. Allan Weissman (Laboratory of Protein Dynamics and Signaling,
National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD; yCD3), Dr. Kazuhiro Nagata
(Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto,
Japan; a1AT), Dr. Ron Kopito (Department of Biology, Stanford University,
Stanford, CA; aTCR), and Dr. Maria Masucci (Department of Cell and
Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; UbG76VGFP),
and their sequences were verified before transfection. Stably transfected
HeLa clones expressing reporter substrates were chosen for experiments.
Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (C-26) or DMEM (HeLa and EMT6)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), antibiotic/
antimycotic solution (Sigma), and 400 Ag/mL geneticin (Sigma; transfected
HeLa cells) to ensure stable expression of plasmid vectors.
Mice. BALB/c mice, 8 to 12 wk of age, were used in the experiments.
Breeding pairs were obtained from the Animal House of the Polish Academy
of Sciences, Medical Research Center (Warsaw, Poland). All in vivo
experiments were done in accordance with the guidelines approved by
the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw.
Reagents. Photofrin (Axcan Pharma, Inc.), verteporfin (a generous gift
of QLT PhotoTherapeutics, Inc.), aminolevulinic acid (Sigma), and hypericin
(prepared, purified, and stored as described; ref. 25) were used as
photosensitizers. MG132 and PSI were purchased from Calbiochem/EMD
and were dissolved in cell culture quality DMSO (Sigma). Bortezomib
(Millenium Pharmaceuticals) was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl.
Tumor treatment and monitoring. Exponentially growing EMT6 and
C-26 cells were harvested, resuspended in PBS, and injected into the
footpad of the right hind limb of experimental mice. Tumor cell viability,
measured by trypan blue exclusion, was >98%. Tumor treatment was started
when all mice developed tumors with a minimum size of 3  4 mm.

Figure 1. Influence of PDT on carbonylation and ubiquitination of cellular
proteins. HeLa cells (A) or C-26 cells (C ) were incubated with 10 Ag/mL
Photofrin for 24 h and exposed to 2.4 J/cm2 light. At indicated time points,
tumor cells were collected, and protein carbonylation was determined by the
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) method. MG132 at 250 nmol/L concentration
was used as a positive control. HeLa cells (B) or C-26 cells (D ) were incubated
with 10 Ag/mL Photofrin for 24 h and exposed to 2.4 J/cm2 light. At indicated
time points, total cell lysates were prepared from tumor cells, and Western blot
analysis was done with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. MG132 at 250 nmol/L
concentration was used as a positive control.

Photofrin (in 5% dextrose) was administered i.p. at a dose of 10 mg/kg
24 h before illumination with 632.8-nm light (day 6 after inoculation of
tumor cells). Control mice received 5% dextrose. The light source was a
He-Ne ion laser. The light at a fluence rate of 40 mW/cm2 was delivered on
day 7 of the experiments using a fiber optic light delivery system as
previously described (26, 27). The total light dose delivered to the tumors
was 90 J/cm2. During illumination, mice were anesthetized with ketamine
(87 mg/kg) and xylazine (13 mg/kg) and were restrained in a specially
designed holder at 37jC. PSI at a dose of 20 nmol (dissolved in DMSO) was
administered intratumorally (i.t.) for 7 consecutive days, with the first
dose given on day 7 of the experiment. Control animals received DMSO.
Bortezomib at a dose of 1 mg/kg was administered i.p. in two different
schedules: on days 5 and 7 after inoculation of tumor cells (before PDT) or
on days 7, 9, 11, and 13 after inoculation of tumor cells (after PDT). Control
mice received 0.9% NaCl i.p. Local tumor growth was determined with
calipers as previously described (28, 29) with the following formula: tumor
volume (mm3) = (longer diameter)  (shorter diameter)2.
Statistical analyses. Data were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2007.
Differences in in vitro cytotoxicity assays and tumor volume were analyzed
for significance by Student’s t test. Kaplan-Meier plots were generated using
days of animal death (after inoculation of tumor cells) as a criterion, and
survival time of animals was analyzed for significance by log-rank survival

analysis. Significance was defined as two-sided P < 0.05. The nature of
the interaction observed between proteasome inhibitors and PDT was
analyzed using the Calcusyn software (Biosoft), which uses the combination
index method of Chou and Talalay (30) based on multiple drug effect
equation. The advantage of this method is the automatic construction of a
fraction-affected combination index table, graph, and calculation of dose
reduction indices by the software. Combination indices of <1 indicate
greater than additive effects (synergism; the smaller the value, the greater
the degree of synergy); combination indices equal to 1 indicate additivity;
and combination indices of >1 indicate antagonism.
Additional procedures are described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

Results
PDT induces carbonylation and accumulation of ubiquitinated
proteins. Time course experiments with approximately equitoxic
light fluencies revealed that PDT led to a robust protein carbonylation detectable 8 hours after illumination of HeLa and
C-26 cells (Fig. 1A and C). Increased protein carbonylation coincided with the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins at
8 hours after illumination (Fig. 1B and D). However, despite a
decrease in the amount of carbonylated proteins in cellular lysates,
there was a further accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins
24 hours after illumination.

Figure 2. Influence of PDT on proteasome
activity and degradation of ER-associated
proteins. A, purified proteasome subunits were
incubated for 30 min with 10 Ag/mL Photofrin
and illuminated with laser light at a fluence of
2.4 J/cm2. Chymotrypsin-like (ChT-like ),
trypsin-like (Trp-like), and caspase-like
(Casp-like ) activities were measured with
fluorogenic substrates. Relative proteasome
activity represents the fluorescence intensity
per microgram of protein. B, C-26 cells were
incubated with 10 Ag/mL Photofrin for 24 h and
exposed to 1.4 J/cm2 light. At indicated time
points, tumor cells were collected, and
proteasome activities measured in whole
tumor cell lysates using fluorogenic substrates.
C, C-26 cells were incubated with 10 Ag/mL
Photofrin for 24 h and exposed to indicated light
fluencies. Proteasome activities were measured
in whole tumor cell lysates collected 24 h after
illumination using fluorogenic substrates.
D, HeLa cells stably transfected with expression
plasmids encoding reporter proteins (yCD3
and GFP-GV) were incubated with 4 ng/mL
bortezomib or 10 Ag/mL Photofrin for 24 h
and exposed to 2.4 J/cm2 light. Indirect
immunofluorescence microscopy was done
using a laser-scanning confocal microscope
24 h after illumination with anti–HA-tag
(to detect yCD3) and anti-GFP primary
antibodies.

Figure 3. Proteasome inhibitors increase the accumulation of carbonylated
and polyubiquitinated proteins in PDT-treated cells. A, EMT6 and HeLa cells
were incubated with 10 Ag/mL Photofrin and/or 4 ng/mL bortezomib (Borte ) for
24 h and exposed to 1.2 J/cm2 light. At indicated time points, tumor cells were
collected and protein carbonylation was determined with DNPH. B, EMT6 cells
were incubated with 10 Ag/mL Photofrin and/or 20 nmol/L PSI for 24 h and
exposed to 1.2 J/cm2 light. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was done
using a fluorescence microscope 24 h after illumination with anti-ubiquitin (red )
and anti-Sec61a (green ) primary antibodies and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
staining (blue ). C, EMT6 cells were incubated with 10 Ag/mL Photofrin,
20 nmol/L PSI, and/or 4 ng/mL bortezomib for 24 h and exposed to 1.2 J/cm2
light. Total cell lysates were prepared from tumor cells 24 h after illumination,
and Western blot analysis was done with anti-ubiquitin antibodies.

To study the influence of photosensitization on proteasome
activity, purified 20S proteasome complexes were incubated with
Photofrin and illuminated with laser light. PDT did not affect the
trypsin-, chymotrypsin-, or caspase-like activities of purified
proteasomes (Fig. 2A). However, despite the lack of direct effect
of photosensitization on proteasome activity, there was a timedependent (Fig. 2B) and dose-dependent (Fig. 2C) induction of
chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasomes in whole-cell lysates of
PDT-treated C-26 cells. These observations indicate that PDT does
not inhibit the activity of proteasomes ( found in extramembranous
compartments of cells). The increased activity of proteasomes in
PDT-treated cells might be an adaptive mechanism to remove
oxidatively damaged proteins.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

To investigate subcellular localization of photodamaged and
polyubiquitinated proteins, we used two HeLa cells stably
transfected with reporter constructs: an ER membrane–associated
model protein (HA-tagged yCD3 chain) and a cytosolic
UbG76VGFP protein (GFP-GV). Most yCD3 resides on the cytosolic
side of the ER membrane and is a substrate for the ERAD
pathway. GFP-GV is a cytosolic protein that has a noncleavable
ubiquitin fused in frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP)
that targets the protein for degradation through the ubiquitinfusion degradation pathway. Photofrin-mediated PDT induced
accumulation of ER-associated yCD3, but not cytosolic GFP-GV
proteins (Fig. 2D). Because Photofrin is a hydrophobic photosensitizer that accumulates in membrane compartments (31), it is
likely that PDT is inducing a selective damage to membraneassociated proteins that leads to ER overloading and thereby
impairment of ERAD.
Oxidative damage and impaired degradation of ER-associated
proteins might lead to ER stress. Indeed, PDT increased the
expression of BiP and calnexin in HeLa cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B); reverse transcription-PCR revealed that PDT
induced a time-dependent unconventional cytosolic splicing of
XBP-1 (Supplementary Fig. S1C); and electron microscopy studies
revealed that PDT led to widening of the ER lumen and to
occasional vacuolization of the cytoplasm of EMT6 cells. These
changes were accompanied by mitochondrial swelling and
formation of infrequent lysosomal vacuoles that could represent
autophagosomal vesicles (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar changes
were noticed in PDT-treated HeLa cells (see below).
Preincubation of tumor cells with proteasome inhibitors
augments accumulation of carbonylated and polyubiquitinated
proteins. Cells remove carbonylated proteins to avoid the toxic
effects of protein aggregation by directing them for proteasomemediated degradation (32, 33). Therefore, we examined whether
inhibition of proteasomal protein degradation would affect the
amount of carbonylated proteins in PDT-treated tumor cells. EMT6
cells were preincubated with bortezomib and Photofrin for 24 hours
and illuminated at a fluence of 2.4 J/cm2. A marked accumulation of
carbonylated proteins was observed within 8 hours after PDT, which
significantly decreased during the next 16 hours (Fig. 3A). In the
presence of bortezomib, the amount of carbonylated proteins was
higher at 8 hours after illumination, and their amount further
increased during the next 16 hours. Similar effects were detected in
HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Immunofluorescence studies also revealed
increased accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in cells
treated with PDT + proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 3B). Similarly, with
Western blotting we observed that proteasome inhibitors increased
the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins that accumulate in PDTtreated tumor cells (Fig. 3C).
Next, we performed immunofluorescence studies with HeLa
cells stably transfected with ER-localized model proteins: yCD3,
a1AT, and aTCR. All these proteins are ERAD substrates. In
normal conditions, they undergo proteasomal degradation and
are undetectable by immunofluorescence. Impairment of ERAD
leads to accumulation of these proteins. a1AT is an entirely
lumenal ERAD substrate (with no association to the ER
membrane), whereas aTCR and yCD3 are single-span transmembrane proteins. Both bortezomib and PDT, when used alone,
induced slight accumulation of reporter proteins in tumor cells,
but only ER membrane–associated proteins (yCD3 and aTCR)
accumulated to a significantly higher extent in HeLa cells
preincubated with proteasome inhibitor and treated with PDT

Proteasome Inhibitors in PDT

(Supplementary Fig. S3A). Immunoprecipitation of polyubiquitinated proteins followed by immunochemical detection of
carbonyl groups revealed that proteins that accumulate in the
treated cells were also carbonylated (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Similarly, immunoprecipitated yCD3 was heavily carbonylated
(Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Preincubation of tumor cells with proteasome inhibitors
potentiates the cytotoxic effects of PDT in vitro. Considering
that PDT induces robust oxidative protein damage followed by
carbonylation, and that proteasomes participate in the degradation
of carbonylated proteins, we decided to investigate the outcome of
the combination treatment including PDT and proteasome
inhibitors. To this end, tumor cells (EMT6, C-26, and HeLa) were
preincubated with Photofrin and/or three different proteasome
inhibitors (bortezomib, MG132, and PSI) for 24 hours and
illuminated at fluencies that produced suboptimal rates of tumor
cell death. Potentiated cytotoxic effects of the combination of
PDT + proteasome inhibitors in all studied cell lines were observed
(Fig. 4). The proteasome inhibitor concentrations shown are the
lowest that produced potentiated cytotoxicity. At higher concentrations of bortezomib, potentiated cytotoxicity was not better
than that at low doses (data not shown), indicating that it might
not be necessary to use high-dose treatment to elicit maximal
cytotoxic response. Chow and Talalay calculations revealed that
proteasome inhibitors and PDT exert synergistic and strongly
synergistic cytotoxic effects against tumor cells. Incubation of
tumor cells with proteasome inhibitors did not increase Photofrin
uptake (Supplementary Table S1), indicating that it is an unlikely
mechanism of potentiated photosensitization.
To further study the mechanism of potentiated cytotoxicity, we
incubated HeLa cells with 250 nmol/L MG132 for either 24 hours

or 1 hour before illumination. A 24-hour exposure to MG132
potentiated the cytotoxic effects of PDT to a higher degree than
did incubation of tumor cells for 1 hour before illumination
(Supplementary Fig. S4). A significant cytotoxicity was observed
already at 4 hours after illumination with 2.4 J/cm2 in HeLa cells
preincubated with MG132, whereas the cytotoxic effects of PDT
alone and PDT combined with a 1-hour preincubation with
MG132 were recorded 24 hours after illumination (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Potentiated cytotoxicity was associated with accumulation of higher amounts of carbonylated proteins in cells preincubated with 250 nmol/L MG132 for 24 hours and treated with
PDT (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Because proteasome inhibitors
induce accumulation of proteins that, under normal conditions,
should be degraded (34), including misfolded proteins in the ER, it
can be hypothesized that the potentiated cytotoxicity results from
the accrual of misfolded and/or oxidatively damaged proteins
beyond the proteasomal degradative capacity. Furthermore, the
influence of proteasome inhibitors on the cytotoxic effects of PDT
with different photosensitizers was evaluated. For these studies,
we used photosensitizers that localize predominantly either in
mitochondria (verteporfin and aminolevulinic acid) or in ER
(hypericin). The ER-localizing photosensitizer hypericin was found
most effective in eliciting potentiated cytotoxic effects in the
combined regimen (Supplementary Fig. S6).
To gain further insight into the mechanisms of potentiated
cytotoxicity of the combination treatment, electron microscopy
studies were done. The most remarkable lesions observed within
8 hours of illumination in cells treated with the combination of
bortezomib and PDT included robust vacuolization of the
cytoplasm, with frequent lysosomal/autophagosomal vesicles and
extended ER (Fig. 5).

Figure 4. Proteasome inhibitors potentiate the cytotoxic effects of PDT. EMT6, C-26, and HeLa cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 Ag/mL Photofrin and/or
proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, MG132, or PSI) at indicated concentrations. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were exposed to different doses of light (as indicated
on the right). Following 24 h of incubation, the cytotoxic effects were measured with crystal violet staining. Columns, mean percent survival versus untreated controls;

Preincubation of tumor cells with proteasome inhibitors
potentiates the antitumor effects of PDT in vivo. In the initial
in vivo experiment, we compared the antitumor effects of the
combination treatment with bortezomib administered either
before or after suboptimal PDT in an immunogenic murine breast
carcinoma (EMT6) model (Fig. 6A and B ). Interestingly,
proteasome inhibition significantly potentiated the antitumor
effects of PDT in both experimental paradigms, with complete
responses observed when bortezomib was administered before or
after PDT. Furthermore, PSI, another proteasome inhibitor,
significantly potentiated the antitumor effects of PDT in murine
colon (C-26) and breast (EMT6) adenocarcinoma models (Fig. 6C
and D). Altogether, in all experiments, a marked potentiation of the
antitumor effects of PDT in vivo was observed, resulting in
retardation of tumor growth, prolongation of the survival time,
and complete disappearance of tumors in at least 60% of animals
(no tumor regrowth for 120 days of observation).

Discussion
It was previously shown that PDT with ER- and mitochondria-localizing purpurin-18 induces protein carbonylation, which

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

is a typical oxidative protein modification (24). Interestingly,
many of the carbonylated proteins identified in this report are
normally functioning within ER and include BiP, calreticulin,
phosphate disulfide isomerase, and HSP cognate 71. The major
mechanism for the elimination of carbonylated proteins is their
degradation by the UPS (32, 33). Therefore, we studied the
influence of Photofrin-mediated PDT on carbonylation and
ubiquitination of proteins. Interestingly, although the level of
protein carbonylation was maximal at 8 hours after PDT and
then decreased (Fig. 1A and C), the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins was still increasing until 24 hours after light
exposure (Fig. 1B and D ). There are several potential
mechanisms for this discrepancy. It is possible that carbonylated proteins are not only ubiquitinated but are also
continuously accumulating in PDT-treated cells. It is also
possible that heavily carbonylated proteins are preferential
substrates for proteasomes, thereby resulting in accumulation
of other proteins destined for degradation. Accumulation of
polyubiquitinated proteins might also be caused by impaired
proteasomal degradation, as has been observed with radiotherapy (35). However, the fact that neither the function of purified
20S proteasomes after direct photosensitization nor the

Cancer Research

proteasome activity in PDT-treated cells was impaired indicates
that PDT does not damage the UPS (Fig. 2A–C). Immunofluorescence studies of HeLa cells expressing model substrates of
the UPS indicated that PDT leads to selective accumulation of
ER-associated reporter protein (yCD3), but not a cytosolic one
(GFP-GV), although both undergo carbonylation after PDT. This
observation indicates that PDT might lead to a selective
impairment of the ERAD pathway, which is responsible for
the retrotranslocation of damaged or misfolded proteins from
the ER for their cytoplasmic degradation within proteasomes
(36). Similar changes might also occur in other cellular
membranes, including mitochondrial or plasma membrane, but
were not further studied here.
We and others have shown that PDT leads to a rapid ROSmediated loss of function of proteins, enzymes, and transporters
colocalized in various cellular compartments with photosensitizers (37–41). For example, the ER-localizing hypericin leads to
a rapid disappearance of SERCA2 Ca2+ transporters, which is
associated with increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels (37). Rapid
disappearance of SERCA2 might be caused by a number of
mechanisms such as fragmentation or cross-linking, but it might
also be caused by its carbonylation resulting in change of the
antibody binding sites (epitopes). The possibility that PDT leads
to ROS-mediated damage to the components of ERAD machinery
will require further studies. It is also possible that elimination of
carbonylated proteins observable within 24 hours results from
engagement of other mechanisms such as autophagy. Indeed,
PDT was shown to induce autophagy in tumor cells (42). Electron
microscopy studies revealed that there are lysosomal/autophagosomal vesicles forming in PDT-treated cells. The potential role of
autophagy in the elimination of carbonylated proteins remains to
be elucidated.
Accumulation of carbonylated proteins within ER is accompanied by induction of ER stress and UPR after PDT (Supplementary Fig. S1). Although it was previously shown that PDT induces
damage to ER (42–44) and increases the expression of ER
chaperones (45–47), the signaling pathways associated with UPR
have not been studied. We observed that PDT leads to
cytoplasmic splicing of XBP-1 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1C),
a transcription factor associated with UPR. Together, these
observations indicate that PDT-induced damage leads to aberrant
protein folding within ER. The balance between the extent of ER
stress and the adaptive UPR response can dictate cell fate (14).
Excessive loading of ER with unfolded proteins that results in
extensive ER stress can overwhelm the capacity of UPR, leading
to cell death (14, 48).
Therefore, we decided to study the cytotoxicity of a combined
regimen consisting of preincubation of tumor cells with
proteasome inhibitors followed by PDT. In all cell lines and
combinations studied, we have observed potentiated cytotoxicity
as compared with either PDT alone or proteasome inhibitor alone
groups (Fig. 4). It is possible that the potentiated cytotoxicity
results from accumulation of proteins within the ER membrane at
the time of illumination and not from any direct interaction of
PDT and proteasome inhibitors because only 24 hours, and not
1 hour, of preincubation of HeLa cells with MG132 significantly
sensitized HeLa cells to PDT (Supplementary Fig. S4 and S5A).
Combined treatment led to accumulation of more carbonylated
and polyubiquitinated proteins in tumor cells as compared with
single modality–treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B), and the
proteins that preferentially accumulate were associated with the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

ER membrane (yCD3 and aTCR) but not with the ER lumen
(a1AT) or cytoplasm (GFP-GV; Supplementary Fig. S3A). These
observations indicate that most severely damaged are ER
membrane–associated proteins. Indeed, transmission electron
microscopy studies revealed that there is a marked vacuolization
of the cytoplasm in bortezomib + PDT–treated cells (Fig. 5),
which might be caused by robust extension of the ER lumen.
However, it cannot be excluded that large vacuoles observed in
tumor cells treated with bortezomib and PDT are of autophagic
origin. In PDT-treated cells, we observed numerous swollen
mitochondria (which also accumulate Photofrin), but these
structures were not present in tumor cells after combination
treatment. It is likely, although not further addressed, that
severely damaged mitochondria were removed in a process of
mitophagy.
The most important observation is that proteasome inhibitors
significantly potentiate the antitumor effects of Photofrinmediated PDT in vivo (Fig. 6). There were complete tumor
regressions in mice treated with the combined regimen, and
after 120 days of observation, tumors relapsed in only up to 40%
of animals. Intriguingly, potentiated antitumor effects were
observed independently of the timing of proteasome inhibitor
administration and occurred when bortezomib was administered
either before or after PDT. Because PDT exerts potent
antivascular effects, it is possible that PDT-treated tumors
undergo ischemia-reperfusion episodes that lead to prolonged
oxidative stress. Therefore, administration of proteasome inhibitors before or after PDT might elicit potentiated antitumor
effects that would result from either sensitization to photooxidation or postillumination oxidative stress caused by ischemiareperfusion.
In conclusion, we observed that Photofrin-mediated PDT
leads to carbonylation and ubiquitination of ER membrane–
associated proteins, accompanied by induction of ER stress
and UPR. Compounds that induce ER stress, such as
proteasome inhibitors, can effectively sensitize tumor cells to
PDT-mediated cytotoxicity. These observations are of clinical
significance because proteasome inhibitors are successful
drugs approved for use in oncology. However, caution should
be exercised in the treatment of tumors growing at certain
anatomic locations (such as esophagus, bronchi, or bladder)
because potential increase in the cytotoxicity to normal cells
might be associated with side effects such as perforations or
bleeding.
