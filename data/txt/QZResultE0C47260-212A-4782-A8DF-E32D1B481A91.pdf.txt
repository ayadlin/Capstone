BACKGROUND: To the authors’ knowledge, the functional significance of the Wnt antagonist dickkopf homolog 4
(DKK4) has not been investigated previously in renal cancer. METHODS: The authors initially observed that the
expression of DKK4 was significantly higher in renal cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal kidney tissues. To
assess the function of DKK4, stable DKK4-transfected cells were established, and functional analyses were performed, including a T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) reporter assay and tests for cell viability, colony
formation, apoptosis, cell cycle, invasive capability, wound-healing capability, and in vivo tumor growth. RESULTS:
The relative TCF/LEF activity was significantly lower in DKK4-transfected cells compared with empty vector, and nuclear b-catenin expression was decreased in DKK4 transfectants. In addition, expression levels of the b-catenin downstream effector proteins cyclin D1 and c-Myc were decreased in DKK4 transfectants. However, greater invasiveness
and migration were observed in stably transfected DKK4 cells. Increased growth of DKK4-transfected tumors also
was observed in nude mice. Members of the Wnt noncanonical/c-Jun-NH2 kinase (JNK) signaling pathway also were
effected, such as c-Jun, which had significantly increased expression and phosphorylation in DKK4-stable transfectants, and matrix metalloproteinase-2, which had significantly increased expression in DKK4-stable transfectants.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to indicate that DKK4 expression is increased in renal cancer tissues and that
DKK4 activates the noncanonical JNK signaling pathway while inhibiting the Wnt-canonical pathway. Cancer

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the third leading cause of death among urologic tumors and accounts for 2% of adult
malignancies.1 Although the rate of detection of incidental RCC has increased with improved diagnostic techniques, metastatic lesions still are identified at diagnosis in approximately 30% of patients with RCC.2 Wnt/b-catenin signaling includes
b-catenin-dependent (canonical) and b-catenin-independent (noncanonical) pathways.3-5 The canonical Wnt signaling
pathway regulates cell fate and proliferation, and that signaling is initiated by the binding of Wnt ligands to frizzled (FZD)
family receptors and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and 6 (LRP5/LRP6) coreceptors. Subsequently,
b-catenin interacts with members of the lymphoid enhancer factor 1/T-cell factor (LEF1/TCF) family, resulting in a functional transcription factor complex and the expression of downstream target genes.3,4 The noncanonical Wnt ligands also
bind to FZD family receptors and to the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) and receptor-like tyrosine
kinase (RYK) coreceptors.4-7 The noncanonical signaling pathways include 3 pathways (the Wnt/Ca2þ, Wnt/G protein, and

Wnt/planar cell polarity [PCP] signaling pathways), and
noncanonical signaling regulates cell polarity and movement.4-7 Among the 5 Wnt antagonist families (secreted
frizzled-related protein [sFRP]; Wnt inhibitory factor 1
[Wif1]; and the Xenopus Cerberus, Wise, and Dickkopf
[DKK] families), the DKK family consists of 4 main members (DKK1-DKK4) that contain 2 distinct cysteine-rich
domains.3,8 In our laboratory, we have studied several Wnt
antagonist genes and their function in renal cancer.9-13
Previously, it was believed that DKK4 acted as an inhibitor
of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer.14,15
Recently, 2 groups observed that DKK4 expression was
increased in colon cancer tissues compared with matched
normal colon tissues and that DKK4 was induced by
activated b-catenin, although DKK4 itself significantly
inhibited TCF/LEF reporter activity in colon cancer cell
lines.16,17 To our knowledge, there have been no reports
regarding DKK4 and renal cancer. Therefore, first, we performed real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) analyses to clarify whether DKK4 is
up-regulated in human renal cancer tissues compared with
matched normal kidney tissues, and the results indicated
that the expression level of DKK4 was significantly higher
in renal cancer tissues compared with matched normal kidney tissues. Next, we used a TCF/LEF reporter assay to
confirm the effect of DKK4 effect on the b-catenin-dependent pathway (canonical pathway) and observed that
relative TCF/LEF activity was inhibited significantly in
DKK4-transfected cells. In addition, b-catenin expression
in the nucleus was decreased in DKK4-transfected renal
cancer cells compared with empty vector cells, and protein
expression of major TCF/b-catenin down-stream effectors
(c-Myc and cyclinD1) was down-regulated in DKK4 transfectants. However, cell invasion and migratory ability were
greater in DKK4-transfected renal cancer cells. On the basis
of these results, we hypothesized that DKK4 may be functionally oncogenic in renal cancer despite its inhibitory
effect on the b-catenin dependent pathway. To verify
this hypothesis, we examined the effects of DKK4 expression on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-)4o-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS)
colony-formation, apoptosis, cell-cycle, invasion, and
migration assays using DKK4-transfected renal cancer cells.

this study (Toho University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan).
The mean patient age was 60 years (range, 41-77 years)
(Table 1). The patients were classified according to World
Health Organization criteria and were staged according to
the tumor-lymph node-metastasis (TNM) classification
system, in which T refers to the size of the renal cancer
and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, N refers to
whether or not regional lymph nodes are involved, and M
indicates whether or not there is distant metastasis. The
pathology for all patients was clear cell renal carcinoma.
Samples were obtained from the patients after written
informed consent was obtained in Toho University
Hospital.
Cell Culture
The renal cancer cell lines A-498 (American Type Culture
Collection [ATCC] number HTB-44) and Caki-1
(ATCC number HTB-46) were purchased from the
ATCC (Manassas, Va). The renal cancer cell lines were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum.

DKK4 in RCC Progression and Invasion/Hirata et al

Plasmid Construction
Plasmids that contained the human full-length combinational DNA fragment of DKK4 (GenBank accession
number NM_014420, catalog number RC221217) were
purchased from Origene (Rockville, Md). This clone
(pCMV6-DKK4) expresses the complete DKK4 open
reading frame with a Tag (MYC/DDK) at the C terminal.

Stable Clone Establishment
To prepare stable cell lines that overexpressed DKK4, we
transfected A-498 cells with the pCMV6-DKK4 expression vector that encodes DKK4 combinational DNA
using FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnosis, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacture’s instructions. Transfected cells were selected by culturing with G418 (150 lg/
mL) for 2 months. Empty vector transfectants were used
as controls. Single colonies of stable transfectants were isolated and expanded for further analysis based on the level
of DKK4 expression. We selected the top 2 stable clones
that had the highest DKK4 messenger (mRNA) expression levels compared with empty vector transfectants. We
named these DKK4 Clone 1 and Clone 2 and used them
for further experiments (MTS, colony formation, invasion, apoptosis, cell cycle analysis, and in vivo studies).
When the cells (stable empty vector cells and stable DKK4
Clone 1 and Clone 2 cells) were confluent, they were trypsinized and resuspended in media according to the protocol. At the same time, we confirmed DKK4 expression
levels in the cells before carrying out the experiments. All
experiments were done in triplicate.

Total RNA and Protein Extraction
Total RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) human renal cancer tissues and
matched, adjacent, noncancerous, normal tissues using an
miRNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) after
microdissection. To digest DNA, the Qiagen RNase-Free
DNase kit was used. Total RNA also was extracted from
cell lines using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Cells were
lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Pierce,
Brebieres, France) that contained protease inhibitors
(Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo). We also
extracted nuclear protein and cytoplasmic protein separately using a CelLytic NuCLEAR extraction kit (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, Mich) to confirm b-catenin expression.
Protein quantification was done using a bicinchoninic
acid protein assay kit (Pierce, Brebieres, France).

T-Cell Factor/Lymphoid Enhancer Factor
Reporter Assay
To monitor the activity of Wnt/b-catenin signal transduction, we used the TCF/LEF reporter assay with TCFreporter plasmids (TOPFLASH, which contains the
wild-type TCF binding site; FOPFLASH, which contains
a mutant-type TCF binding site; Millipore, Billerica,
Mass). The pRL-TK renilla luciferase (Promega, Madison, Wis) was cotransfected to normalize transfection efficiency. A-498 renal cancer cells were stimulated with
recombinant mouse Wnt3a protein (100 ng/mL;
rmWnt3a, catalog number 1324-WN; R & D Systems,
Minneapolis, Minn). FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnosis)
was used for transfection according to the manufacture’s
instructions. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Luciferase activity was assayed at 48 hours after transfection using a dual-Luciferase reporter assay system
(Promega).
Cell Viability Assay
Stably transfected DKK4 Clone 1 and Clone 2 cells or
empty vector A-498 cells were maintained in medium
supplemented with 150 lg/mL G418. Cell viability was
measured after 4 days with MTS (CellTiter 96 Aqueous 1
Solution cell proliferation assay; Promega). To verify the
effect of DKK4 on renal cancer cells, we also performed
similar MTS assays using another renal cancer cell line
(Caki-1). Data are reported as the mean  standard deviation of 6 independent experiments.
Soft Agar Colony-Formation Assay
Soft agar colony formation was assayed with empty vector
A-498 cells and A-498 DKK4 stably transfected cells
(Clones 1 and 2) using a Cell BioLabs CytoSelect Cell
Transformation Assay kit (Cell BioLabs Inc., San Diego,
Calif). The cells were incubated for 7 days in a semisolid
agar media before they were solubilized and detected by
using the provided (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2-5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution in a microplate
reader (optical density [OD], 570 nm). The absorbance
was compared between empty vector cells and stably
transfected DKK4 cells (Clones 1 and 2). Data are
reported as the mean  standard deviation of 8 independent experiments.
Cell Invasion Assay
A cell-invasion assay was performed with the CytoSelect
24-well Cell Invasion Assay Kit as described previously
(Cell BioLabs Inc.). Empty vector A-498 cells and stable

DKK4 Clone 1 and 2 cells were resuspended to the upper
chamber in triplicate. To verify the effect of DKK4 on renal cancer cells, we performed invasion assays using
another renal cancer cell line (Caki-1). Cells migrating
through the membrane were stained and counted with a
microscope. Five random fields were chosen for each
membrane, and the results were expressed as migrated
cells quantified at OD 560 nm after extraction.
Wound-Healing Assay
The wound-healing process begins with tissue matrix
remodeling, migration, and eventual closing of the wound
area. Therefore, this assay frequently is used to assess cancer cell migration. A wound-healing assay was performed
with the CytoSelect 24-well Wound Healing Assay Kit as
described previously (Cell BioLabs Inc.). To generate
a wound field, the cells were cultured until they formed
a monolayer around the insert. After removing insert, a
0.9 mm open wound field was left. Cells migrated from
either side of the gap. The wound closure was monitored
and the percentage closure was measured at 10 hours
between empty vector cells and DKK4 Clone 1 and Clone
2 cells. To verify the effect of DKK4 on renal cancer cell,
we also performed migration assays using another renal
cancer cell line (Caki-1) according to the following formula: percentage closure rate (%) ¼ migrated cell surface
area/total surface area  100.
Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Analysis
Empty vector A-498 cells and stably transfected DKK4
Clone 1 and 2 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and trypsinized. After inactivating trypsin in
complete medium, the cells were resuspended in ice-cold
1-lL binding buffer (70 lL). Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (V-FITC) solution (10 lL) and 7-aminoactinomycin D viability dye (20 lL) were added to 70 lL of
the cell suspensions. After incubation for 15 minutes in
the dark, 400 lL of ice-cold 1-lL binding buffer were
added. The apoptotic distribution of the cells in each sample was then determined using fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) (Cell Lab QUANTA SC; Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, Calif). The various cell phases were
determined using a DNA stain (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Cell populations in G0/G1 phase, S phase, and
G2/M phase were measured using fluorescence and were
contrasted against cell volumes. Data are reported as the
mean  standard deviation of 4 independent experiments. To verify the effect of DKK4 on renal cancer cells,

1652

we performed apoptosis and cell cycle analyses using
another renal cancer cell line (Caki-1).
Quantitative Real-Time Reverse
Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed in triplicate with an Applied Biosystems Prism 7500 Fast
Sequence Detection System using TaqMan universal
PCR master mix according to the manufacture’s protocol
(Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, Calif). TaqMan
probes and primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems Inc. Human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous control.
Levels of RNA expression were determined using the
7500 Fast System SDS software package (version 1.3.1;
Applied Biosystems Inc.).
Western Blot Analysis
Total cell protein (20 lg) was used for Western blot analysis. Samples were resolved in 4% to 20% Precise Protein
Gels (Pierce, Brebieres, France) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences,
Fairfield, Conn). The membranes were immersed in
0.3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) that contained 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 hour and probed with primary polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against cyclin
D1 (catalog number 556470; BD Biosciences, San Jose,
Calif), c-Myc (catalog number 551102; BD Biosciences),

In Vivo Study
Groups of 6 female nude mice (strain BALB/c nude;
Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, Mass),
ages 4 to 5 weeks, received subcutaneous injections of 1 
107 A-498 empty vector (n ¼ 6) or A-498-DKK4 stably
transfected cells (Clone 1 [n ¼ 5] or Clone 2 [n ¼ 5]) in
the right flank area at a volume of 200 lL. Tumor size was
determined using calipers once weekly for 35 days, and tumor volume was calculated on the basis of width (x) and
length (y) as follows: x2y/2, where x<y. After the mice
were killed, the tumors were resected and weighted. In
addition, tumor tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin and with DKK4 (catalog number AP1524a;
ABGENT, San Diego, Calif) for histologic examination.
Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Studies
Subcommittee of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center
(Protocol 08-003-01).

Establishment of DKK4 Stable Clones and
Effects of DKK4 on Cell Viability, Colony
Formation, and Cell Invasion
After transfection of A-498 or Caki-1 cells with a
pCMV6-DKK4 expression plasmid, the DKK4 expression level was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses (Fig. 2B). DKK4 protein expression was
observed in both DKK4 stably transfected A-498 cells and
in DKK4 transiently transfected Caki-1 cells. Then, cell
viability analyses (MTS assay), colony-forming assays,
and cell-invasion assays were performed using stable
DKK4 transfectants of A-498 cells or transient DKK4
transfectants of Caki-1 cells. We observed enhanced
growth of A-498 and Caki-1 cells after DKK4 transfection
by MTS and colony-formation assays (Fig. 2C,D). DKK4
also promoted the in vitro invasion and migration ability
of A-498 and Caki-1 cells (Fig. 3A,B).
In Vivo Study
A-498 cells that were stably transfected with either empty
vector or the DKK4 gene (stable Clones 1 and 2) were
injected subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice.
Tumor growth was promoted significantly in the mice
that had DKK4-transfected cells compared with those that
had empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). We performed immunohistochemistry for DKK4 in grown
tumors and confirmed that DKK4 protein was highly
expressed in DKK4-transfectant tumors (Fig. 3C).
Apoptosis, Cell Cycle Analyses, and Cleaved
Caspase 3 Expression
Apoptosis and cell cycle analyses were performed to investigate whether DKK4 overexpression affected these parameters in renal cancer cells. However, no significant
difference was observed in the number of apoptotic cells
between DKK4-transfected Clones 1 and 2 and control
cells (Fig. 4A,B). There was no significant difference
observed in any of the cell cycle phases (G0/G1 phase,

procaspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 in DKK4 transfectants
(stable Clone 2) and in controls using Western blot analysis, but no difference was observed in procaspase expression between the transfectants, and no cleaved caspase 3
expression was observed in either transfectant (Fig. 4C).

cyclin D1 and c-Myc, in Western blot analyses (Fig. 5A).
We observed decreased expression of these proteins in
DKK4 stable transfectants. In addition, we compared the
protein expression of b-catenin in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions between empty vector and DKK4 transfectants. Consistent with the TCF/LEF reporter assay results
and the decreased TCF/LEF down-stream effector expression, b-catenin expression in the nucleus was decreased
significantly in DKK4 transfectants (Fig. 5B). In contrast
to the b-catenin-dependent pathway protein expression,
we observed tumor growth promotion (in vitro and in
vivo) and increased invasion and migration ability in
DKK4-transfected cells, suggesting that DKK4 influenced
other cancer pathways. Therefore, we investigated the
expression of genes in the b-catenin-independent pathway

1656

Wnt-JNK, and observed that c-Jun expression and phosphorylation were increased significantly in DKK4 stable
transfectants, as indicated in Figure 5C. In addition, 1 of
the major down-stream effectors, MMP-2, also had
increased expression in DKK4 transfectants.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we observed that the expression of DKK4
was up-regulated in renal cancer tissues compared
with matched, normal kidney tissues. These results suggested that DKK4 may have oncogenic functions in renal
cancer. Recently, several reports have indicated that
DKK4 expression was high in cancer tissues compared
with normal tissues in patients with colon cancer.16,17

Our current results are consistent with those previous
reports.16,17
DKK4 is 1 of the Wnt antagonist genes and generally has been regarded as an inhibitor of the Wnt canonical pathway.14 Initially, to investigate the relation
between DKK4 and the canonical pathway, we performed
TCF/LEF reporter assays and observed that DKK4 inhibited TCF/LEF reporter activity and that b-catenin expression in the nuclear protein fraction was down-regulated in
DKK4-transfected renal cancer cells. Expression of c-Myc
and cyclin D1, which are major TCF/LEF down-stream
effector proteins, also was down-regulated in DKK4transfected cells. This finding means that DKK4 may be
involved in the b-catenin-dependent pathway and that
DKK4 is a b-catenin-dependent pathway inhibitor, as
described in previous reports in patients with colon
cancer.16,17
In contrast to the inhibitory effect of DKK4 on the
b-catenin-dependent Wnt pathway, DKK4 promoted cell
proliferation, invasion, and migration in renal cancer cells
(the A-498 and Caki-1 cell lines). We also observed that

Cancer

DKK4 promoted the in vivo tumor growth of A-498 cells.
The Wnt signaling pathway involves b-catenin-dependent
(canonical) and b-catenin-independent (noncanonical)
pathways.4,18 The noncanonical pathway includes 3 pathways (the Wnt/Ca2þ, Wnt/G protein, and Wnt/PCP signaling pathways).5 These pathways primarily regulate cell
movement.5 The role of noncanonical pathways in renal
cancer is less understood. Among these, it is believed that
the JNK pathway is involved in the noncanonical pathway
(the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway).5 Noncanonical Wnt
signals are transduced through FZD receptors, and small
G-proteins (RhoA, the ras-related protein Rac, cell division cycle 42 [CDC42]) and JNK are involved with dishevelled (Dvl)-dependent effector molecules.4 Generally,
Rac1 mediates JNK activation. However, the exact role of
JNK in Wnt-mediated signaling remains unknown.19-21
Recently Fukukawa et al reported that FZD homologue
10 was highly expressed in synovial sarcoma, caused the
activation of the noncanonical Dvl-Rac1-JNK pathway,
and also caused destruction of the actin cytoskeleton
structure through the down-regulation of RhoA

activation.22 The activation of JNK is associated with apoptosis in response to various cellular stresses and antiapoptotic and growth-promoting effects.23 Regarding cancer,
several reports on JNK-related apoptosis in response to
cellular stress have been published.24-28 In renal cancer,
JNK-related apoptosis also has been reported.29,30 Among
DKK family members, DKK3 induces apoptosis in several cancers (prostate, testicular, and breast cancers)
through the activation of JNK.24-26 DKK1 also plays an

1658

important role in the induction of apoptosis through the
activation of JNK in placental choriocarcinoma and
mesothelioma.27,28 Regarding DKK4, to our knowledge,
there have been no reports demonstrating its relation to
the JNK pathway in cancer. Previous studies in colon cancer indicated that ectopic DKK4 expression increased the
migration and invasion properties of colon cancer cells,
and our results are consistent with those reports.16,17
Khatlani et al reported that JNK was activated in nonsmall cell lung cancer biopsy samples and promoted
oncogenesis.23 Wang et al also observed that the overexpression of active JNK in human breast cancer cells did
not cause apoptosis but enhanced cell migration and invasion.31 In the current study, we examined apoptosis by
using FACS and investigated active caspase 3 protein
expression by using Western blot analysis in A-498 cells
that were stably transfected with either DKK4 or empty
vector. We did not observe a significant change in apoptotic cell numbers between DKK4 and control transfectants,
and there was no cleaved caspase 3 expression in these
cells. These results suggest that DKK4 is not associated
with the induction of apoptosis. However, we did observe
the significant promotion of cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. We also observed that DKK4 transfectants
displayed enhanced tumor growth in nude mice compared with control transfectants. In addition to the phosphorylation of JNK, the expression and phosphorylation
of c-Jun were increased in DKK4-transfected A-498 cells.
This result is similar to that reported by Wang et al.31
The JNK pathway includes several down-stream
proteins. The MMP family plays an important role in cell
invasion and metastasis in renal cancer and is mediated by
several intracellular pathways.32-35 Fromigue et al
reported that atorvastatin (a member of the drug class
known as statins) reduced MMP expression or activity in
invading osteosarcoma cells and that the inhibition of
JNK reduced MMP-2 activity.34 Inamoto et al reported
that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) stimulation significantly increased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP9 and also increased the invasive activity of renal cancer
cells.35 GABA stimulation promoted the phosphorylation
of microtubule-associated protein kinases, including
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, JNK, and p38.35
In the current study, we observed increased MMP-2
expression in DKK4-transfected A-498 cells. Thus, our
results suggest that DKK4 promotes the noncanonical
pathway by activating JNK, resulting in up-regulation of
c-Jun expression and phosphorylation and increasing
MMP-2 expression. Therefore, the up-regulation of

Cancer

DKK4 in RCC Progression and Invasion/Hirata et al

MMP-2 may be involved in the increased growth of
DKK4-transfectant tumors in nude mice. Although the
exact molecular mechanism with which DKK4 regulates
MMP-2 expression is unknown, our findings indicate
that further studies will be warranted on the roles of
DKK4 in renal cancer invasion and metastasis.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first
report documenting higher DKK4 expression in renal
cancer tissues compared with matched, normal kidney tissues. We examined the role of DKK4 in the canonical and
noncanonical Wnt pathways and observed that DKK4
inhibited the canonical pathway. Although DKK4 did
not induce apoptosis, it promoted renal cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration probably through the
noncanonical JNK pathway, which also increased MMP2 expression. Thus, the current findings contribute
important information about the role of DKK4 in renal
cancer cells.
