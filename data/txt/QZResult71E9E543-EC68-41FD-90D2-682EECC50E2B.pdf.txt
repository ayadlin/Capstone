Abstract
According to a Prognoscan database, upregulation of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase
(Btk) is associated with low overall survival in ovarian cancer patients. We found
that spheroids-forming ovarian cancer cell, which highly expressed cancer stem-like
cell (CSC) markers and Btk, were cisplatin resistant. We next treated CSCs and nonCSCs by a combination of ibrutinib and cisplatin. We found that chemoresistance was
dependent on Btk and JAK2/STAT3, which maintained CSC by inducing Sox-2 and
prosurvival genes. We suggest that addition of ibrutinib to cisplatin may improve
treatment outcome in ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based
chemotherapy, usually yields a multiyear survival rate,
prolonged use of platinum-based chemotherapy usually
induces drug resistance. Although a deeper understanding
of this disease has been attained, relapse still occurs in
70% of patients 18 months after the first-line treatment
[4, 5]. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a novel drug that
effectively impacts on ovarian cancer especially that is
resistant to current chemotherapy [4, 6].
Recent evidence has suggested that a small subset of
ovarian cancer cells with cancer stem cell (CSC) properties
can survive chemotherapy and play a major role in tumor
relapse. Platinum-based chemotherapy effectively kills
common cancer cells, but it fails to kill CSCs. CD44+/
CD117+ cells isolated from human epithelial ovarian
cancer show stem cell properties with high tumorigenicity
in vivo, strong survival, and high resistance to several
chemotherapeutic drugs, including 5-fluorouracil,
carboplatin, and cisplatin. For CD117+ cells, the

Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common
malignancy in women and is the leading cause of death
from gynecological cancers [1]. With an extremely high
mortality rate, ovarian cancer is a public health problem
worldwide. Ovarian cancer has typical clinical behavior.
Even though 80% of ovarian patients have symptoms in
early stage when the cancer is only limited in the ovary,
the non-distinctive symptoms make more than 75%
ovarian cancer patients diagnosed in late stage [1-3].
Ninety-two percent of ovarian cancer patients in stage I
have a 5-year survival. However, patients diagnosed in the
late stage have poor prognosis, with only 19% of 5-year
survival rate for stage IV patients [1, 4]. Because ovarian
cancer exhibits this clinical behavior, developing an
effective treatment strategy for late-stage ovarian cancer
patients is crucial. Although the current standard first-line
treatment for late-stage ovarian cancer, which includes a

aforementioned properties are suggested to be due to
the overexpression of ABCG2 and ABCB1 transporters,
which can effectively efflux chemotherapeutic drugs [7].
Furthermore, because CSCs have self-renewal ability, they
can promote tumor progression and clinical recurrence [5,
8, 9]. Therefore, pharmacologic targeting of CSCs is very
promising [10].
Targeting signaling pathways that are specifically
crucial in CSCs might be a useful strategy for developing
a breakthrough treatment. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk)
is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that exhibits various
modulatory effects in response to external stimuli. The
Btk family can mediate downstream signaling pathways
of G-protein coupled receptors, antigen receptors, and
integrins to regulate cell growth, differentiation, and
apoptosis [11]. B lymphocytes [12] and myeloid cells
[13] with low Btk activity tend to undergo apoptosis and
exhibit decreased proliferation, suggesting the importance
of Btk in cell survival and growth pathways. Moreover,
Btk inhibits Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis, but induces
Akt and NF-κB activation [14, 15]. In addition, another
major pathway downstream of Btk that increases cancer
progression is mediated by activation of signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Although STAT3
has been proven to regulate CSCs in some cancers [16,
17], its involvement through Btk signaling in ovarian
cancer remains unproven. Therefore, in this study, we
explored the role of Btk in regulating ovarian CSCs;
particularly, we examined the link between Btk regulation
and the STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, according to
the PrognoScan bioinformatics database (http://www.
abren.net/PrognoScan/), the overall survival rate of
patients with Btk overexpression is significantly lower
than that of patients with low Btk expression. We here
demonstrated that ovarian cancer spheroids that represent
CSCs are highly resistant to cisplatin, and this resistance
is attributable to the overexpression of Btk signaling.
Btk silencing effectively reduced the expression of the
Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 pathway, which in turn
suppressed the survival of cancer cells through Sox-2
and BCL-XL genes and, finally, restored responsiveness
to cisplatin. In addition, we proved that ibrutinib as an
adjunct to cisplatin has synergistic effects on cancer cells,
indicating that this drug can improve the clinical response
to cisplatin in the future.

immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Btk and histotypes
of all recruited ovarian cancer patients are summarized
in Table 1. We categorized the IHC staining results into
the following three groups as described previously [18]:
no staining (n = 5), weak or focal staining (n = 21), and
moderate or intense staining (n = 24). IHC staining of
tissue arrays showed that the expression of Btk was high
in malignant cells and in line with disease progression
(Fig. 1A, Table 1). Compared with the tissues from
patients in the early stage, those from patients in the late
stage exhibited more intense Btk staining. Granulosa cells
that originated from the sex cord showed negative staining
for Btk, whereas malignant cells consistently expressed
Btk (Fig. 1A). We also found that Btk expression was
related to metastasis (χ2=4.146; p=0.042) and clinical
stage (χ2=4.080; p=0.043) (Table 2). Immunoblotting
data showed that the expression of Btk was consistently
higher in tumor parts than in nontumor parts (Fig. 1B).
In addition, we observed that patients with moderate or
intense staining of Btk had a significantly lower survival
rate than those with no or weak or focal staining of Btk
(Fig. 1C). Our Kaplan–Meier graph was consistent with
survival data from the PrognoScan database (Fig. 1D).
According to the bioinformatics database provided by
PrognoScan, Btk overexpression was correlated with a
lower overall survival rate in ovarian cancer. All of these
results suggested that Btk is specifically expressed in
malignant cells and its expression is in line with disease
progression. We used Cox proportional hazard model
to determine the relationship of four parameters (age,
metastasis, stage and Btk expression) to overall survival in
malignant ovarian tumor patients with surgical resection.
Among these factors, only high Btk expression was related
to unfavorable overall survival (hazard risk=1.115; 95%
confidence interval=1.047 – 2.293) (Table 3). Therefore,
Btk might be a potential histological biomarker and a
prognostic predictor of overall survival in ovarian cancer
patients.

Ovarian CSCs contribute to cisplatin resistance
The proportion of CSCs in ovarian cancer was
reported to be a prognostic predictor and can be detected
according to the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)
activity [20]. To understand the importance of ovarian
CSCs in cisplatin resistance, we initially determined the
molecular characteristics of stemness and epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, including
Klf-4, c-Met, and TCF-8, in nine ovarian cancer cell
lines. These cancer cell lines, according to their platinum
resistance, have been categorized as highly resistant,
moderately resistant, or responsive to platinum-based
therapy. ES-2 [21], Hey-A8 [22, 23], TOV-21G [24], and
TOV-112D [25] are highly resistant to chemotherapy,
whereas CAOV-3, SKOV-3, OVCAR-5, and A2780 are
moderately resistant to chemotherapy [23, 25, 26]. OV-

malignant cell line in this study [26]. We observed that
cells from the more malignant cell lines ES-2, TOV21G, and Hey-A8 had high expression levels of Klf-4,
c-Met, and TCF-8 (Fig. 2A). By contrast, OV-2008 cells
exhibited low expression levels of Klf-4, c-Met, and TCF8 (Fig. 2A). Next, we analyzed the phenotype of spheroid
formation in these cancer cell lines. As expected, cells
from more malignant cell lines such as ES-2 and Hey-A8
had greater ability to form ovarian spheroids than did
OV-2008 cells (Fig. 2B). Because ALDH1 activity is
a conventional marker for CSC [27], we examined the
expression of ALDH1 as an index of the proportion of
CSCs. Flow cytometry data revealed that ES-2, TOVwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

21G, and Hey-A8 cells that expressed high levels of TCF8, Klf-4, and c-Met had higher proportion of ALDH1high
cells (Fig. 2C), indicating the high proportion of CSCs.
Finally, to study the importance of ovarian CSCs in
chemoresistance, we generated spheroids from several
parental cell lines and then compared the responsiveness to
cisplatin between spheroids and parental cells. According
to a cell viability assay conducted after treatment with
cisplatin, compared with their respective parental cells,
spheroids of the TOV-112D, TOV-21G, and ES-2 cell lines
were more resistant to cisplatin (Fig. 2D). Treatment with
cisplatin at concentrations up to 10 µM resulted in cell
death rates of only 10%–20% in spheroids of the TOV112D, TOV-21G, and ES-2 cell lines, and the IC50 values

pathway activation. In addition, Btk signaling in such
spheroids might also follow the Syk–Btk–PLCγ2 axis,
because our immunoblotting data revealed that spheroids
of ES-2 and Hey-A8 cells expressed higher levels of Syk,
Btk, and PLCγ2 than did the respective parental cells
(Fig. 3A). In addition to PLCγ2 activation, STAT3 was
upregulated in these spheroids (Fig. 3A). Etk is another
member of the BTK family [11]. The significantly
higher expression of Btk than of Etk indicated that the
expression of CSCs is highly regulated by Btk. Therefore,
the upregulation of N-cadherin in ovarian CSCs [30]
was consistent with the expression of Btk. Moreover,
microscopic immunofluorescence analysis confirmed
the differences in the Btk, p-Btk, p-STAT3, and Sox-2
expression profiles between spheroids and parental cells
from the ES-2 cell line (Fig. 3B). Altogether, these results
proved our hypothesis that ovarian CSCs play a major role
in cisplatin resistance and that Btk signaling is crucial for
regulating ovarian CSCs.

of cisplatin for these spheroids were 29.28, 17.82, and
57.16 µM, respectively. By contrast, the IC50 values of
cisplatin for parental cells of the TOV-112D, TOV-21G,
and ES-2 lines were 4.00, 4.82, and 9.84 µM, respectively.
These high IC50 values indicated that, compared with
the parental cells, spheroids exhibited high resistance to
cisplatin. Thus, these findings suggest that CSCs play a
major role in cisplatin resistance.

Ovarian CSCs express Btk signaling pathway in
high levels
Btk is nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that can be
modulated by several upstream signaling pathways,
including the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) pathway.
Deregulation of the Syk–Btk axis has been implicated in
certain hematological malignancies and immunological
diseases [28]. Syk enhances Btk activity on several
downstream proteins, such as phospholipase C gamma 2
(PLCγ2) [29] and STAT3 [11]. We observed that ovarian
cancer spheroids originating from ES-2 cells, which
overexpressed Sox-2 and N-cadherin, had high Btk

In situ expression of Btk signaling was elucidated using 3D immunofluorescent staining. Antibodies against Btk, p-Btk, p-STAT3, and Sox2 were used. Btk signaling was highly expressed and activated in ovarian spheroids, indicating the importance of Btk signaling in ovarian
cancer stemness regulation.

survival and cisplatin resistance

20 μM. Furthermore, we determined the expression of
Btk in spheroids in situ. Human ovarian cancer spheroids
were developed from parental and Btk-knocked-down
ES-2 cells. We observed that the expression of Btk and
phosphorylated Btk was markedly higher in the ES-2
spheroids than in the knocked-down cells. Accordingly,
ES-2 spheroids exhibited high expression of p-STAT3 and
Sox-2 (Fig. 5F). A summary of our proposed mechanism
is presented in Fig. 5G.

The importance of Btk in mediating the survival of
ovarian cancer cells remains unclear. We proposed that
Btk mediates chemoresistance through the regulation of
ovarian CSCs. To prove our hypothesis, we performed
gain-of-function (Fig. 4) and loss-of-function studies
(Fig. 5). We overexpressed Btk in OV-2008 cells, which
are primarily responsive to cisplatin, and observed that
the overexpression of Btk promoted STAT3 activation.
Consequently, several downstream effectors of STAT3,
such as Sox-2 and Bcl-XL, were upregulated (Fig. 4A).
Because of the high stemness gene regulation in OV2008 cells overexpressing Btk, these cells easily formed
spheroids and enriched the CSC population (Fig. 4B).
In loss-of-function studies, we found that Btk
knockdown reduced the expression of JAK2 and STAT3
targets such as BCL-XL (Fig. 5A). The results of
gene silencing experiments were comparable to those
after treatment with ibrutinib (Fig. 5B). We observed
that treatment with ibrutinib for 48 h concentrationdependently reduced Btk phosphorylation as well as
Sox-2 and Bcl-XL protein expression. Subsequently, Btk
silencing reduced the self-renewal ability of ES-2 cells
and reduced the population of cells with high ALDH1
activity. This reduction in the population (Fig. 5C) and
decrease in spheroid-forming ability (Fig. 5D) after Btk
silencing indicated the suppression of ovarian CSCs.
In addition, we proved that after Btk knockdown, ES-2
cells became more sensitive to cisplatin (Fig. 5E). Btksilenced cells were compared with control cells following
48 h of treatment with cisplatin at concentrations ranging
from 2.5 to 20 μM. A significant difference in cytotoxicity
was observed in groups treated with cisplatin at 10 and

Cisplatin–ibrutinib combination has beneficial
effects in eliminating ovarian cancer cells
A sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay was performed
to determine cell viability after treatment with cisplatin
only, ibrutinib monotherapy, or a cisplatin–ibrutinib
combination. In addition, isobologram or combination
analysis was performed using CompuSyn software to
study the combined effect of the two drugs. The cisplatin–
ibrutinib combination had synergistic or additive effects
on serous (Hey-A8) and clear cell types (ES-2) of ovarian
cancers (Fig. 6A and 6B). The synergistic effects that were
evident in most of the combination regimens indicated
that the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib can sensitize cancer cells to
platinum, whereas the additive effects indicated that both
drugs independently eliminated cancer cells. Moreover,
ibrutinib may be a potential drug candidate for overcoming
platinum resistance in clear cell carcinoma and malignant
cystadenocarcinoma, which are the most malignant and
most prevalent subtypes, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Ovarian cancer remains the most lethal
gynecological malignancy worldwide. A challenge in the

management of ovarian cancer is increasing treatment
response to current standard chemotherapy. A large-scale
randomized trial showed that in the advanced stage of the
disease, cisplatin alone does not improve overall survival
because of low responsiveness. Moreover, >55% of cancer
patients in the trial relapsed after completing standard
chemotherapy alone, and 72% of cancer patients relapsed
after debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy
[31]. However, cisplatin, as the first-line chemotherapeutic
agent for ovarian cancer, is the most widely used
chemotherapy drug. Therefore, we investigated a
strategy for potentiating the effect of cisplatin so that it
can be easily translated in clinical settings. In addition,
compared with other platinum-based chemotherapeutic
drugs, cisplatin causes less myelosuppression, and, thus,
combining it with other drugs is more feasible [32].
Although discovered decades ago, cisplatin is still
widely used to treat several cancers, including ovarian
cancer. Cisplatin functions by forming intrastrand
cross-links with the target DNA, triggering necrosis
or apoptosis. However, several mechanisms may help
cancer cells evade cellular death induced by platinum

[33]. Primarily, approximately 70%–90% of platinum
resistance is caused by reduced platinum uptake or
increased efflux [34]. CSCs overexpress ABC transporter,
resulting in platinum efflux, and have a self-renewal
ability, which triggers relapse. CSC population, which
we measured on the basis of ALDH1 expression by using
flow cytometry, may become a major tool for predicting
prognosis. Correlations of ALDH1 activity with CSCs and
poor clinical outcomes were previously reported in breast
cancer [35]. In a gynecological malignancy, cisplatin
resistance was correlated with CSC population, which was
recognized according to the ALDH1 activity of CSCs [36].
Ovarian cancer patients with high ALDH1 activity have a
significantly poor overall survival rate [20]. We surveyed
the stemness regulator genotypes, spheroid formation
ability, and ALDH1 activity of nine ovarian cancer cell
lines and found that ES-2 and Hey-A8, as highly platinumresistant cell lines, consistently exhibited high levels of
ALDH1 activity. ES-2 was originated from clear cell
carcinoma, a histological subtype of ovarian cancer with a
poor prognosis [37], and this poor prognosis may be in line
with the proportion of CSCs. In addition, we proved that

poorest prognosis, and the serous cystadenocarcinoma
Hey-A8 cell line, which is the most prevalent subtype. We
demonstrated that cisplatin–ibrutinib combination therapy
had a significant effect on the elimination of cancer cells.
Our data indicate the importance of using combination
therapy to eradicate CSCs and non-CSCs. Clear cell
carcinoma has been described as a prognostic factor
for ovarian cancer. Patients with a clear cell carcinoma
subtype easily develop chemoresistance and relapse. Thus,
they have a poor prognosis [37]. According to our results,
we believe that inhibition of the Btk pathway could be
an effective strategy for overcoming platinum resistance.
We also believe that the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib, of which
the safety and efficacy in treating blood malignancies
have been determined satisfactory in phase III clinical
trials, can be applied in clinical settings [44]. However,
the efficacy of ibrutinib in ovarian cancer therapy has
never been studied. Collectively, our results indicate that
administering ibrutinib, as a Btk inhibitor, may facilitate
sensitizing ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin through
inhibition of the JAK2 pathway.

ovarian CSCs are the major source of tumor development
and resistance to chemotherapy because ovarian spheroids
have higher resistance to cisplatin than do parental cells
(Fig. 2). Therefore, the proposed application of ALDH1
activity as a prognostic predictor in ovarian cancer patients
may be mediated by the chemoresistance properties of
ovarian CSCs.
Spheroid formation is a method through which
CSCs are enriched in various tumors. A spheroid is
enriched with CSCs because it is formed through the selfrenewal ability of CSCs [38, 39]. “Sphere-forming cells”
or spheroids are commonly found within the ascitic fluid
from late-stage ovarian cancer patients and become the
source of metastasis because of high tumorigenicity [40].
In a previous study, 2000 cells from spheroids transplanted
through xenografting triggered tumorigenesis, whereas 105
wild-type cells were required to trigger tumorigenesis [41].
Pharmacological targeting of CSCs is very promising [10].
Inhibition of alkaline phosphatase by levamisole disrupted
self-renewal ability of ovarian CSCs and suppressed tumor
growth in vivo [42]. We confirmed that ovarian spheroids
have higher resistance to cisplatin than do non-CSCs.
However, we found that ovarian spheroids that were
enriched with ovarian CSCs exhibited high Btk signaling
(Fig. 3). Therefore, we determined the importance of Btk
signaling in ovarian cancer and the possible application
of the novel Btk inhibitor ibrutinib in ovarian cancer
therapy. We examined the downstream effectors of the
Btk pathway that play major roles in the maintenance and
self-renewal of CSCs. After silencing Btk gene in ovarian
cancer cell lines, we observed that the JAK2 pathway was
downregulated (Fig. 5A). Therefore, expression levels of
several effectors of STAT3, such as Bcl-XL and Sox-2,
were diminished. Bcl-XL is a major cell cycle regulator
(prosurvival), and its upregulation leads to increased
cell growth [43]. Therefore, suppression of Bcl-XL
can promote cell death. We showed that the expression
of Sox-2 can be decreased through Btk silencing and
can be upregulated through a Btk gain-of-function
strategy. Furthermore, we confirmed that ibrutinib can
concentration-dependently reduce the expression of Sox2. Consequently, Btk silencing reduced the self-renewal
ability of ovarian cancer spheroids (Fig. 5D). Moreover,
administration of ibrutinib reversed chemosensitivity
in vitro. Clear cell carcinoma cells, as one of the most
malignant subtypes [37], regained chemosensitivity after
Btk knockdown.
We observed the beneficial effect of ibrutinib in
combination with cisplatin. Cisplatin was used in this study
because it is the most widely used drug in conventional
chemotherapy and it causes lower myelosuppression
compared with other platinum-based chemotherapeutic
drugs. Administering the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib exerted
synergistic effects on cisplatin (Fig. 6). For combination
analysis, we used the high-grade clear cell carcinoma
ES-2 cell line, which is among the subtypes with the

CONCLUSION
The present study is the first to report the
importance of Btk in the chemoresistance and metastasis
of ovarian cancer. The specific expression of Btk in
ovarian malignancy may be useful as a novel histological
biomarker. We showed that chemoresistant ovarian cancer
cell lines highly expressed CSC regulatory genes. In
addition, ovarian spheroids enriched with CSCs were
more resistant to cisplatin when the Btk signaling pathway
was activated. This result supports the concept of CSCs
in chemoresistance and indicates that Btk inhibitors can
be used as novel CSC-targeting drugs in ovarian cancer
treatment. We demonstrated the beneficial effect of the Btk
inhibitor ibrutinib in ovarian cancer treatment. Ibrutinib
in combination with cisplatin had synergistic effects
on chemotherapy. Btk plays crucial roles in regulating
ovarian CSCs through JAK2/STAT3 activation. We proved
that Btk inhibition through Btk gene silencing can affect
CSC properties related to responsiveness to cisplatin.
Altogether, our findings suggest that Btk is crucial in
ovarian cancer chemoresistance. In addition, the Btk
inhibitor ibrutinib may be beneficial as an adjunct for
overcoming platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.

the Declaration of Helsinki for biomedical research were
also followed to get the approval by Joint Institutional
Review Board (JIRB) of the Taipei Medical University
(approval number: 201411003). Tissue array from 50
patients in different clinical stages were prepared for
immunohistological analysis (Superbiochips, #CJ2).
Antibody against Btk (1:400, SC-81159, Santa Cruz, USA)
was used according to the standard immunohistochemistry
protocol. A similar dilution of the control mouse IgG
was applied as a negative control. The expression of Btk
was then evaluated and confirmed by two pathologists.
According to the expression of Btk, samples were
categorized into the following groups: no staining, weak or
focal staining, and moderate or intense staining. Samples
with weak diffuse staining were considered as weak
staining, whereas focal staining was defined as intense
staining limited to a focal area. Staining was considered
moderate or intense when the expression of Btk exceeded
80% [18]. Western blotting was performed to determine
the Btk protein level in the tumor part relative to that in
the nontumor part. The immunoblotting membrane was
incubated with a primary antibody against Btk (1:600, SC81159, Santa Cruz) and β-actin (1:5000, Abcam, UK).

material).

Flow cytometry
The ALDH activity of the nine ovarian cancer cell
lines was detected using the ALDEFLUOR assay kit
(StemCell Technologies, USA) according to the standard
protocol. Cells were suspended in the ALDEFLUOR assay
buffer containing an ALDH substrate and incubated for
1 h at 37°C. Flow cytometry was performed using BD
Fortessa (BD Biosciences, USA), and data were analyzed
using BD software.

Ovarian cancer spheroid formation
Cancer cell spheroids were generated according
to a previously described protocol [19]. Parental cells
(approximately 105) were seeded on a nonattached vessel
with a serum-free cell medium containing growth factors
suitable for CSC enrichment. Non-stem cells died because
of starvation, whereas CSCs were alive and aggregated to
form spheroids. At least three passages were performed
to obtain highly pure CSCs. The cells were seeded in a
25T flask and supplemented with a stem cell medium
(Nutristem, Biological Industries, Israel) at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 incubator for 2 days when the spheroids were clearly
visible under a microscope.

Culture of ovarian cancer cell line
The human ovarian cancer cell lines A2780,
Hey A8, ES-2, SKOV-3, CAOV-3, TOV-112D, TOV21G, OVCAR-5, and OV-2008 were provided by the
American Type Culture Collection. All nine cell lines
were maintained in the McCoy 5A medium (Gibco,
Life Technologies, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum
in a standard condition. Spheroids were originated from
parental cells in a stem cell medium according to an
established protocol (Nutristem-XF, Biological Industries,
Israel) [19]. A third generation of spheroids was collected
to obtain highly pure enriched CSCs for further study.

Btk gene-function analysis in ovarian cancer cell
lines
The gain- and loss-of function of Btk in ovarian
cancer cell lines were studied using commercially
available systems. For gain-of-function study, the openreading-frame of Btk (gene accession No. NM_000061)
was cloned in pEZ-Lv105 expression vector (Cat. No.
EX-A0534-Lv105, OmicsLinkTM Expression clone,
GeneCoepia, USA). Btk gene-silencing shRNA mir sets
(expression Arrest GIPZ lentiviral shRNA mir) were
purchased from Thermo Scientific (USA). Two clones
were found effectively silenced Btk expression, A6
(clone ID, V2LHS-89195) and B10 (V3LHS-639151)
and non-silencing verified negative control (RHS4346)
was used as control. The production of lentiviral particles
(for both gain and loss of function studies) were carried
out according to vendor’s instructions and under strict
adherence of practice guidelines in certified BSL-2
laboratory in The Integrated Laboratories for Translational
Medicine, Taipei Medical University.

Assay for relative cell number
The cell lines were seeded in 96-well plates (3.5 ×
105 cells/well). After treatment, the cells were cultured
for 48 h and the relative cell number was calculated
using a SRB reagent according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Sigma, USA). The viability of nonattached cells
in ovarian spheroids was quantified using Alamar blue
staining (Life Technologies, USA).

Western blotting

Immunofluorescent staining analysis

Western blotting was performed using a standard
method. The membrane was incubated with primary
antibodies (list of antibodies is available in Supplementary

The cells were seeded onto 96 well-plates (3 ×
103 cells/well)and subsequently treated with cisplatin
for 48 h (abiplatin injection, Pharmachemie BV, the
Netherlands) and a Btk inhibitor (ibrutinib, Cellagen
Technology, USA), and viable cells were quantified using
an SRB assay. To analyze the possible combined effects of
cisplatin and ibrutinib, CompuSyn software was employed
after the standard Chou–Talalay algorithm was used for
combination analysis.
