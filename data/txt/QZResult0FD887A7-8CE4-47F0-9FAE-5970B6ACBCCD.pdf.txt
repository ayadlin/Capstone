Abstract
BIM (BCL2L11) is a BH3-only proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. BIM upregulation is
required for apoptosis induction by EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) in EGFRmutant forms of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Notably, a BIM deletion polymorphism occurs naturally
in 12.9% of East Asian individuals, impairing the generation of the proapoptotic isoform required for the
EGFR-TKIs geﬁtinib and erlotinib and therefore conferring an inherent drug-resistant phenotype. Indeed,
patients with NSCLC, who harbored this host BIM polymorphism, exhibited signiﬁcantly inferior responses to
EGFR-TKI treatment than individuals lacking this polymorphism. In an attempt to correct this response
defect in the resistant group, we investigated whether the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat
could circumvent EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines that also harbored the BIM
polymorphism. Consistent with our clinical observations, we found that such cells were much less sensitive
to geﬁtinib-induced apoptosis than EGFR-mutant cells, which did not harbor the polymorphism. Notably,
vorinostat increased expression in a dose-dependent manner of the proapoptotic BH3 domain-containing
isoform of BIM, which was sufﬁcient to restore geﬁtinib death sensitivity in the EGFR mutant, EGFR-TKI–
resistant cells. In xenograft models, while geﬁtinib induced marked regression via apoptosis of tumors
without the BIM polymorphism, its combination with vorinostat was needed to induce marked regression of
tumors with the BIM polymorphism in the same manner. Together, our results show how HDAC inhibition
can epigenetically restore BIM function and death sensitivity of EGFR-TKI in cases of EGFR-mutant NSCLC
where resistance to EGFR-TKI is associated with a common BIM polymorphism. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2428–34.

Introduction
The EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI),
geﬁtinib and erlotinib, have shown marked therapeutic effects
against non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR-activating mutations, such as exon 19 deletions and L858R point
mutations (1). About 20% to 30% of patients, however, show
intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKIs despite having tumors harboring these EGFR mutations. In addition, patients who
respond initially later develop acquired resistance to EGFRTKIs after varying periods of time (2). Among the molecular
mechanisms associated with acquired resistance to EGFR-

TKIs are (i) gatekeeper mutations in EGFR (i.e., a T790M
second mutation), (ii) activation of bypass signaling caused
by Met ampliﬁcation or hepatocyte growth factor overexpression, (iii) transformation to small-cell lung cancer, and (iv)
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (3, 4). Several therapeutic strategies, including new generation EGFR-TKIs and the
combination of an EGFR-TKI and a Met-TKI, have been
evaluated clinically in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs (2). The mechanisms of
intrinsic resistance, however, remain poorly understood.
Recently, a BIM deletion polymorphism was reported to be a
novel mechanism of intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKIs (5). BIM,
also called BCL2L11, is a proapoptotic protein and a member of
the Bcl-2 family. Gene products (such as BIMEL, BIML, and
BIMS) with a BH3 domain, which is essential for apoptosis
induction, antagonize antiapoptotic proteins (such as Bcl-2,
Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1) and activate proapoptotic proteins (such as
BAX and BAK), thereby inducing apoptosis (6, 7). Activation of
BAX and BAK induce cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm
and result in activation of the caspase cascade (8). BIM is
pivotal in apoptosis induced by EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant
NSCLC cells (9). The expression and degradation of BIM
is regulated mainly by the MEK-ERK pathway (10). The
BIM deletion polymorphism is relatively common in East
Asian populations (12.9%), with 0.5% of individuals being

Overcoming EGFR-TKI Resistance Due to BIM Polymorphism

homozygous for this deletion. During the transcription of BIM,
either exon 3 or exon 4, the latter of which encodes the BH3
domain, is spliced out due to the presence of a stop codon and a
polyadenylation signal within exon 3 (11). The BIM deletion
polymorphism involves the deletion of a 2903 bp fragment in
intron 2 and results in the preferential splicing of exon 3 over
exon 4, generating a BIM isoform that lacks the BH3 domain (5).
A retrospective analysis in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC
showed that progression-free survival (PFS) following EGFRTKI treatment was signiﬁcantly shorter in patients with the
BIM polymorphism (6.6 months) than with wild-type BIM (11.9
months; ref.5). Another study in patients with EGFR-mutant
NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs also reported that PFS was
signiﬁcantly shorter in patients with BIM-low (4.3 months)
than BIM-high (11.3 months) expressing tumors (12), suggesting that reduced expression of BIM with a BH3 domain
is associated with an unfavorable response to EGFR-TKIs.
To date, however, no therapeutic strategy has yet been developed for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with low BIM
expression.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is an enzyme that regulates
chromatin remodeling and is crucial in the epigenetic regulation of various genes (13). Many compounds targeting
HDAC have been developed, including vorinostat, an HDAC
inhibitor approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (14). In mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL) cell lines and in cells from patients with MCL,
vorinostat induced histone hyperacetylation on promoter
regions and consequent transcriptional activation of proapoptotic BH3-only genes, including BIM (15). Using in vitro
and in vivo models, we assessed whether the combination of
vorinostat and geﬁtinib restored the expression of BIM
protein with a BH3 domain in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells
with the BIM polymorphism and overcame EGFR-TKI resistance associated with this polymorphism.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The NSCLC cell lines, PC-9, HCC827, and HCC2279, all of
which have EGFR mutations, were obtained from ImmunoBiological Laboratories Co., ltd., the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), and Dr. John Minna (University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), respectively. PC-3
cells, established from a Japanese female patient with
NSCLC and with an exon 19 deletion in EGFR, and differing
from the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 (ATCC CRL1435),
were purchased from Human Science Research Resource
Bank (JCRB0077: http://cellbank.nibio.go.jp/~cellbank/cgibin/search_res_det.cgi?DB_NUM=1&ID=252 ¼ 1&ID ¼ 252).
PC-3 and the other 3 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) and RPMI-1640 medium,
respectively, each supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.
All cells were passaged for less than 3 months before renewal
from frozen, early-passage stocks. Cells were regularly screened
for mycoplasma using a MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit
(Lonza). The cell lines were authenticated at the laboratory of
the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation (Osaka, Japan)

www.aacrjournals.org

by short tandem repeat analysis. Vorinostat and geﬁtinib were
obtained from Selleck Chemicals and AstraZeneca,
respectively.
Genotype and expression analysis of BIM
Genomic DNA was extracted from cells using DNeasy Blood
and Tissue Kits (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy
PLUS Mini kits (Qiagen). PCR methods were used to detect the
BIM deletion polymorphism in the samples and the level of
expression of BIM isoforms (5).
Cell apoptosis
Cells (3  103) were seeded into each well of 96-well,
white-walled plates, incubated overnight, and treated with
the indicated compounds or vehicle [dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)] for 48 hours. Cellular apoptosis was analyzed with
Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kits (Promega), which measure caspase-3/7 activity, and PE-Annexin V Apoptosis Detection
Kits (BD Biosciences, in accordance with the manufacturers'
directions.
Apoptotic cells in tumor xenografts were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, using the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL
system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol.
RNA interference
Duplexed Stealth RNAi (Invitrogen) against BIM and Stealth
RNAi-negative control low GC Duplex #3 (Invitrogen) were
used for RNA interference (RNAi) assays as described (4). The
siRNA target sequences were 50 -CAUGAGUUGUGACAAAUCAACACAA-30 and 50 -UUGUGUUGAUUUGUCACAACUCAUG30 for BIM #1, and 50 -UGAGUGUGACCGAGAAGGUAGACAA-30
and 50 -UUGUCUACCUUCUCGGUCACACUCA-30 for BIM #2.
Western blot analysis
Western blotting was conducted with antibodies against
phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068), Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), cleaved
PARP, cleaved caspase-3, histone H3, acetylated histone H3
(Lys27), BIM, and b-actin (Cell Signaling Technology); and
against phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), Erk1/2, and EGFR
(R&D Systems). Blots were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies speciﬁc to
mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin G, with signals detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Biotechnology).
Subcutaneous xenograft models
Male BALB/cAJcl-nu/nu mice, ages 5 to 6 weeks, were
obtained from CLEA Japan Inc and injected subcutaneously
into their ﬂanks with cultured tumor cells (5  106 cells/0.1
mL/mouse). When tumor volumes reached 100 to 200 mm3, the
mice were randomized and treated once daily with geﬁtinib
and/or vorinostat. Each tumor was measured in 2 dimensions,
and the volume was calculated using the formula: tumor
volume (mm3) ¼ 1/2  length (mm)  width (mm)2. All animal
experiments complied with the Guidelines for the Institute for
Experimental Animals, Kanazawa University Advanced Science Research Center (approval No. AP-081088).

Results

Vorinostat upregulates BIM and efﬁciently induces
apoptosis when combined with geﬁtinib
Because HDAC inhibition modulates the expression of
various genes, including proapoptotic molecules (13), we
hypothesized that the HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat, may sensitize EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with the BIM polymorphism to
geﬁtinib. In EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines, including PC-3
and HCC2279 cells, vorinostat dose dependently increased the
expression of acetylated histone H3 and BIM with the BH3
domain (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. S3A). We further explored
whether the addition of vorinostat to geﬁtinib induced apoptosis in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with the BIM polymorphism (Fig. 2B and D). In HCC827 and PC-9 cells, which contain
only wild-type BIM, geﬁtinib inhibited downstream signaling,

EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines harboring the BIM
deletion polymorphism have low susceptibility to
geﬁtinib-induced apoptosis
We ﬁrst examined the BIM deletion polymorphism in EGFRmutant NSCLC cell lines by PCR. PC-9 and HCC827 had wildtype alleles, with a PCR product 4.2 kb in size. Consistent with a
previous report (5), HCC2279 cells were heterozygous for the
BIM deletion polymorphism, with PCR products 4.2 kb (wildtype) and 1.3 kb (2.9 kb deletion polymorphism) in size. Among
the 7 additional cell lines with EGFR mutations (Supplementary Table S1), PC-3 was heterozygous for the BIM deletion
polymorphism (Fig. 1A). Western blot analyses reveal that the
expression of the proapoptotic BIM protein was markedly
lower in PC-3 and HCC2279 than in PC-9 and HCC827 cells.
Analysis of BIM isoform transcripts showed that cells with the
BIM polymorphism expressed more exon 3- than exon 4containing transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
Treatment with geﬁtinib enhanced BIM expression, caspase-

3/7 activities, and apoptosis in PC-9 and HCC827 cells much
more than in PC-3 and HCC2279 cells (Fig. 1B; Supplementary
Fig. S1C, S1D, and S2). Moreover, geﬁtinib did not increase
caspase-3/7 activity in PC-9 and HCC827 cells treated with BIM
siRNA (Fig. 1C), indicating the crucial role of BIM in apoptosis
induction in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells treated with EGFRTKI. These observations clearly showed that EGFR-mutant
NSCLC cells with the BIM deletion polymorphism are much
less sensitive to geﬁtinib, as shown by induction of apoptosis,
than cells with wild-type BIM.

including the phosphorylation of EGFR, Erk, and Akt, resulting
in apoptosis, as shown by the expression of cleaved PARP and
cleaved caspase-3. The further addition of vorinostat augmented BIM expression and caspase-3/7 activity. In PC-3 and
HCC2279 cells, which contain the BIM polymorphism, however, treatment with geﬁtinib alone induced minimal apoptosis, although the phosphorylation of EGFR, Erk, and Akt was
inhibited, whereas the combination of vorinostat and geﬁtinib
markedly increased the expression of BIM, as well as of cleaved
PARP and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig.
S3B). This combination also augmented caspase-3/7 activity
compared with that of geﬁtinib or vorinostat alone (Fig. 2D and
Supplementary Fig. S3C), but this activation of caspase-3/7 was
inhibited by knockdown of BIM (Supplementary Fig. S4A and

www.aacrjournals.org

S4B). Conversely, overexpression of BIMEL itself stimulated
caspase-3/7 activities in cells with the BIM polymorphism, with
these activities further enhanced by geﬁtinib treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). These results indicate that BIM
mediates the activation of caspase-3/7 induced by geﬁtinib and
vorinostat. Analysis of BIM transcripts revealed that vorinostat
alone induced BIM mRNA, which was enhanced by the inclusion of geﬁtinib. Moreover, vorinostat treatment preferentially
induced transcripts containing exon 4 over those containing
exon 3 (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the combination of
vorinostat and geﬁtinib inhibits HDAC and increases the
expression of BIM protein with the BH3 domain, thereby
sensitizing EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with the BIM polymorphism to apoptosis in vitro.

Combined treatment with vorinostat with geﬁtinib
shrinks tumors produced by EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells
with the BIM polymorphism
We next determined the in vivo efﬁcacy of vorinostat and
geﬁtinib. Geﬁtinib alone almost completely shrunk xenograft
tumors induced by HCC827 cells (Fig. 3A). Although geﬁtinib
monotherapy prevented the enlargement of tumors produced
by PC-3 cells, which harbor the BIM polymorphism, it did not
induce their complete regression, indicating that PC-3 cells
remained less susceptible to geﬁtinib in vivo. Under these
experimental conditions, vorinostat monotherapy inhibited
tumor growth slightly, whereas the combination of vorinostat
with geﬁtinib resulted in marked tumor shrinkage (Fig. 3B).
None of the mice treated with these agents showed any
macroscopic adverse effects, including loss of body weight
(data not shown).
To clarify the mechanisms by which vorinostat and geﬁtinib
act in vivo, we assessed tumor-cell apoptosis by TUNEL staining. Geﬁtinib treatment increased the number of apoptotic

cells in HCC827 tumors but had little effect on PC-3 tumors
(Fig. 4A and B), indicating that EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with
the BIM polymorphism are refractory to geﬁtinib-induced
apoptosis in vivo as well as in vitro. Importantly, although
vorinostat alone had little effect on apoptosis, the combination
of vorinostat and geﬁtinib induced marked apoptosis in PC-3
tumors (Fig. 4A and B). Western blot analyses showed that
geﬁtinib induced cleavage of caspase-3 in HCC827, but not in
PC-3, tumors. In PC-3 tumors, treatment with geﬁtinib or
vorinostat had little effect on caspase-3 cleavage, whereas
their combination increased BIM expression and the cleavage
of caspase-3 (Fig. 4C and D). These ﬁndings indicate that the
combination of vorinostat and geﬁtinib increases BIM protein
expression and induces tumor-cell apoptosis, thereby shrinking tumors produced by EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with the
BIM polymorphism.

Discussion
EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with the BIM deletion polymorphism show impaired generation of BIM with the proapoptotic
BH3 domain, as well as resistance to EGFR-TKI–induced
apoptosis (5). We have shown here that treatment of cells
with the combination of vorinostat, a HDAC inhibitor, and
geﬁtinib, an EGFR-TKI, restored the expression of BIM protein
with a BH3 domain (predominantly BIMEL), induced apoptosis,
and overcame geﬁtinib resistance in vitro and in vivo.
Although vorinostat preferentially induced expression of
BIM containing the BH3 domain, its exact mechanisms of
action remain unclear. The wild-type allele may be more
susceptible to the effects of HDAC inhibition than the deletion
allele due to differences in the acetylation status of these
alleles. Alternatively, vorinostat may affect the splicing process,
resulting in the production of exon 4- rather than exon 3containing transcripts from the deletion polymorphism allele
as HDAC has been found to affect the splicing of RNA (16).
Vorinostat has been shown to induce the expression of
several genes other than BIM (13). However, we found that
BIM was pivotal not only for geﬁtinib-induced apoptosis but
also when combined with vorinostat. Moreover, the combination of vorinostat and geﬁtinib increased BIM expression and
markedly induced apoptosis in PC-3 and HCC2279 cells. Collectively, these ﬁndings strongly suggest that vorinostat promotes geﬁtinib-induced apoptosis in EGFR-mutant NSCLC
cells with the BIM polymorphism, primarily by increasing BIM
expression. Several other mechanisms, including inhibition of
epigenetic modiﬁcations leading to a drug-tolerant state (17)
and transition of cancer cells from a resistant mesenchymal
state to an E-cadherin–expressing epithelial state (18) may be
also involved.
Both the BIM polymorphism and EGFR mutations are more
prevalent in East Asian than in Caucasian populations. Few
East Asian patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC show a complete response to EGFR-TKIs (1). This incomplete response,
including intrinsic resistance, may be due, in part, to low BIM
expression associated with the BIM polymorphism (6). Our
preclinical data indicate that vorinostat increases BIM even in
BIM-wild type EGFR--mutant NSCLC cells. However, a clinical
trial with erlotinib and entinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, in

unselected patients with NSCLC, more than 65% of whom were
Caucasian, failed to show therapeutic beneﬁts (19). These
ﬁndings suggest that the combination of vorinostat and an
EGFR-TKI should be tested in selected patients with NSCLC
with EGFR mutations and the BIM polymorphism.
Resistance to EGFR-TKIs associated with the BIM deletion
polymorphism may be overcome by treatment with BH3
mimetics, such as ABT-737 (5). Although ABT-737 antagonized
antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, it did not
antagonize the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, which is overexpressed in NSCLC (20), suggesting that the effects of BH3
mimetics may be limited to overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance
caused by the BIM polymorphism in NSCLC. BH3 mimetics are
being evaluated in early-phase clinical trials but are not ready
for use in clinical practice. In contrast, vorinostat has been
approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with
advanced primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (15). Therefore,
the combination of geﬁtinib and vorinostat could easily be
tested clinically.
The BIM polymorphism can be detected in formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded tumor tissues and peripheral blood (5).

Moreover, a convenient and easy access PCR screening method
can detect this polymorphism in circulating DNA from serum
(Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). As the BIM polymorphism is
a germline alteration, it can be assayed in serum obtained at
any time point. Collectively, our ﬁndings illustrate the importance of clinical trials testing the ability of combinations of
vorinostat and EGFR-TKIs to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance
associated with the BIM polymorphism in patients with EGFR--mutant NSCLC.
