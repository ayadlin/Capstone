The landscape of somatic copy-number alteration across human
cancers
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.

Abstract
Author Manuscript

A powerful way to discover key genes playing causal roles in oncogenesis is to identify genomic
regions that undergo frequent alteration in human cancers. Here, we report high-resolution
analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3131 cancer specimens, belonging
largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at
significant frequency across multiple cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the
presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are
enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators
and the NF-κB pathway. We show that cancer cells harboring amplifications surrounding the
MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend upon expression of these genes for survival.
Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are
present in multiple cancer types.

Background
The development of cancer is driven by the acquisition of somatic genetic alterations,
including single base substitutions, translocations, infections, and copy number
alterations1,2. Recent advances in genome characterization technologies have enabled
increasingly systematic efforts to characterize these alterations in human cancer samples3.
Identification of these genome alterations can provide important insights into the cellular
defects that cause cancer and suggest potential therapeutic strategies2.

Somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs, distinguished from germline copy-number
variations, CNVs; see Supplementary Note 1a) are extremely common in cancer4,5,6.
Genomic analysis of tumor samples, by cytogenetic studies and more recently array-based
profiling, have identified recurrent alterations associated with particular cancer types4,5,6. In
some cases, focal SCNAs have led to the identification of cancer-causing genes and
suggested specific therapeutic approaches7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

Author Manuscript

A critical challenge in the genome-wide analysis of SCNAs is distinguishing the alterations
that drive cancer growth from the numerous, apparently random alterations that accumulate
during tumorigenesis (see Supplementary Note 1b). By studying a sufficiently large
collection of tumors, it should ultimately be possible to create a comprehensive, highresolution catalog of all SCNAs consistently associated with the development of all major
types of cancer. Key open questions include: the extent to which significant SCNAs are
associated with known cancer-related genes or indicate the presence of new cancer-related
genes in particular tumor types; the extent to which large sample collections can be used to
pinpoint the precise ‘targets’ of recurrent amplifications or deletions and thereby to identify
cancer-related genes (see Supplementary Note 2); and the extent to which SCNAs are
restricted to particular types or shared across many cancer types, suggesting common
biological pathways.
In this paper, we explore these issues by studying copy-number profiles from 3,131 cancers
across more than two dozen cancer types, with the data all derived from a single
experimental platform and analyzed with a common, rigorous statistical methodology.

Results
Author Manuscript

A collection of 3,131 copy-number profiles from multiple cancer types
The 3,131 cancer copy-number profiles consisted of 2,509 profiles determined by our
laboratory (see references in Supplementary Note 3), including over eight hundred
previously unpublished profiles, and 622 profiles determined by other groups11,15,16. The
majority (2965) come from 26 cancer types, each represented by more than 20 specimens.
Seventeen cancer types are represented by at least 40 specimens each (Supplementary Table
1). Most profiles (2,520) were obtained from tissue specimens, with the remainder from
cancer cell lines (541) and melanoma short-term cultures (70).

Author Manuscript

Copy-number measurements were obtained on a single array platform, the Affymetrix 250K
Sty array, containing probes for 238,270 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We
compared the signal intensities from each cancer specimen to array data from 1480 normal
tissue specimens (of which 1140 were paired with cancer specimens from the same
individual) to identify regions of somatically generated SCNA. We recorded the genomic
position, length, and amplitude of change in normalized copy-number for every SCNA
(Supplementary Figure 1a and Supplementary Methods).
We observed a total of 75,700 gains and 55,101 losses across the 3131 cancers, for a mean
of 24 gains (median = 12) and 18 losses (median = 12) per sample. For most (17/26) cancer
types, the mean number of SCNAs per sample was within two-fold of these overall means

(Supplementary Figure 1b). Across all samples, 8.3% of amplification and 8.7% of deletion
breakpoints (excluding those occurring within centromeres or telomeres) occured in regions
of segmental duplication, which is enrichment relative to the proportion of genome in such
regions (5.1% of SNPs; p<10−20 in each case) and likely reflects a predisposition to SCNA
formation17. An average of 17% of the genome was amplified and 16% deleted in a typical
cancer sample, compared to averages of 0.35% and less than 0.1% in normal samples
(representing germline CNVs and occasional analytic artifacts).
Focal and chromosome arm-level alterations have different background rates
Across the entire genome, the most prevalent SCNAs are either very short (focal) or almost
exactly the length of a chromosome arm or whole chromosome (arm-level) (Figure 1a). The
focal SCNAs occur at a frequency inversely related to their lengths, with a median length of
1.8 Mb (range 0.5 kb – 85 Mb).

Author Manuscript

Arm-level SCNAs occur approximately 30 times more frequently than would be expected
by the inverse-length distribution associated with focal SCNAs (Figure 1a). This observation
is seen across all cancer types (Supplementary Figure 2) and applies to both copy gains and
losses (data not shown). As a result, in a typical tumor, 25% of the genome is affected by
arm-level SCNAs and 10% by focal SCNAs, with 2% overlap. All arm-level (and most
focal) SCNAs are of low amplitude (usually single-copy changes), but some focal SCNAs
can range to very high amplitude. When analyzing SCNAs for evidence of significant
alteration in cancer, we accounted for the difference in background rates between arm-level
and focal SCNAs by considering them separately.

Author Manuscript

Multiple studies have analyzed patterns of arm-level SCNAs across large numbers of cancer
specimens4,5,6, and our results are largely in agreement with theirs. We additionally
observed that the frequency of arm-level SCNAs decreases with the length of chromosome
arms. Adjusted for this trend, the majority of chromosome arms exhibit strong evidence of
preferential gain or loss, but rarely both, across multiple cancer lineages (see Figure 1b and
Supplementary Note 4).
The large size of arm-level SCNAs makes it difficult to determine the specific target gene or
genes. By contrast, mapping of focal SCNAs has great power to pinpoint the important
genes targeted by these events7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.
Pooled analysis of focal SCNAs

Author Manuscript

We determined those regions in which SCNAs occur at a significantly high frequency. For
this purpose, we calculated the genome-average “background” rates for SCNAs in our
dataset as a function of length and amplitude, and used the Genomic Identification of
Significant Targets In Cancer (GISTIC) algorithm18 with improvements as described in
Supplementary Methods.
We identified 158 independently regions of significant focal SCNAs, including 76
amplifications and 82 deletions, in the pooled analysis of all our data (Figure 1c and
Supplementary Table 2). This number was relatively robust to changes in the number of
samples (Supplementary Figure 3a) and removal of individual cancer types from the pooled

analysis (Supplementary Figure 3b). Indeed, a stratified analysis of 680 samples distributed
evenly across the 17 most highly represented cancer types identified 76% of these
significant SCNAs, similar to the number expected based upon the reduced power of this
smaller sample set (Supplementary Figure 3a).
The most frequent of these significant focal SCNAs (MYC amplifications and CDKN2A/B
deletions) involve 14% of samples, while the least frequent are observed in 2.3% of samples
for amplifications and 1.5% for deletions. The frequency of significant arm-level SCNAs is
higher (15–29% of samples; Supplementary Figure 3c). These frequencies are likely to be
underestimates, as some SCNAs are not detected due to contamination of tumor samples
with DNA from adjacent normal cells, technical error, and the incomplete spatial resolution
afforded by the SNP array platform.

Author Manuscript

For each of the 158 significant focal SCNAs, we determined a confidence interval (“peak
region”) that has a 95% likelihood of containing the targeted gene (Supplementary Figure
3d). Our large dataset enables more sensitive and high-resolution detection of peak regions
than prior copy-number analyses (see Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Table 3).
An even larger dataset would be desirable, based on analyses showing that the increase in
resolution with sample size has not reached a plateau (Supplementary Figure 3e).

Author Manuscript

The 76 focal amplification peak regions contain a median of 6.5 genes each (range 0–143,
including microRNAs). Sixteen regions contain more than 25 genes each; the remaining 60
regions contain in aggregate 364 potential target genes. We found that 25 of the 76 regions
(33%) contain functionally validated oncogenes documented to be activated by
amplification (Supplementary Table 2), including 9 of the top 10 regions (MYC, CCND1,
ERBB2, CDK4, NKX2-1, MDM2, EGFR, FGFR1, and KRAS; Figure 1c, Supplementary
Table 2). The tenth region, on 1q, contains nine genes; we present evidence below that the
target gene in this region is the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member, MCL1.
The 82 focal deletion peaks contain a median of seven genes each (range 1–173). Nineteen
regions contain at least 25 genes each; the remaining 63 regions contain in aggregate 474
potential target genes. Nine of the 82 regions (11%) contain functionally validated tumor
suppressor genes documented to be inactivated by deletion (Supplementary Table 2). Two
additional deletions (involving ETV6 and the span from TMPRSS2 to ERG) are associated
with translocation events that create oncogenes. Another deletion adjacent to the T-cell
receptor beta locus occurs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and likely is not associated with
cancer, as it occurs during normal T-cell development.

Author Manuscript

The remaining 70 deletion peaks do not contain known tumor suppressor genes,
translocation sites, or somatic rearrangements. Over one-third (26) contain large genes,
whose genomic loci span more than 750 kb; none of these genes has been convincingly
demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor gene. Conversely, 19 of the 40 largest genes in the
genome occur in deletion peaks (Figure 2a; p = 3×10−9). This association between deletions
and large genes could be due to a propensity for both to occur in regions of low gene
density. Indeed, large genes tend to occur in gene-poor regions (Figure 2a, bottom), and an
analysis of all SCNAs in the dataset reveals that deletions (but not amplifications) show a

bias toward regions of low gene density (up to 30% below the genome average; Figure 2b).
Even after removing the 26 SCNAs containing large genes, the gene density among the
remaining deletions is still 25% below the genome average. These observations suggest that
some of the deletions may not be related to cancer etiology, but rather may reflect a high
frequency of deletion or low levels of selection against deletion in these regions.

Author Manuscript

The majority of known amplified oncogenes reside within the 76 amplified regions,
although there are exceptions. For example, MITF19 is likely undetected because it is a
lineage-specific oncogene restricted to melanoma. At least 10 known deleted tumor
suppressor genes do not reside in the deleted regions in the pooled analysis (BRCA2,
FBXW7, NF2, PTCH1, SMARCB1, STK11, SUFU, VHL, WT1, and WTX). Some of these are
specific to cancer types not represented in our dataset (e.g. NF2, WT1, and WTX), while
others primarily suffer arm-level deletions (with possible additional deletions beyond the
resolution of the array platform) (e.g. BRCA2, FBXW7, STK11 and VHL). Other tumor
suppressor genes may be missed if they lie within regions whose background deletion rates
are lower than the genome-wide average, or if they are adjacent to genes whose deletion is
poorly tolerated (which would be expected to occur more readily in regions of high gene
density) (see Supplementary Note 1). Such tumor suppressors might be inactivated by point
mutations more often than SCNAs.
Specific gene families and pathways are over-represented among focal SCNAs

Author Manuscript

We assessed potential cancer-causing genes in the SCNAs using GRAIL (Gene
Relationships Among Implicated Loci20), an algorithm that searches for functional
relationships among genomic regions. GRAIL scores each gene in a collection of genomic
regions for its ‘relatedness’ to genes in other regions based on textual similarity between
published abstracts for all papers citing the genes, on the notion that some target genes will
function in common pathways.
We found that 47 of the 158 peak regions (34 of the 76 amplification peaks and 13 of the 82
deletion peaks) contain genes significantly related to genes in other peak regions (Figure
2c). In 21 of these regions, the highest-scoring gene was a previously validated target of
SCNA in human cancer (Supplementary Table 2). Across all peak regions, the literature
terms most significantly enriched refer to gene families important in cancer pathogenesis,
such as kinases, cell cycle regulators, and MYC family members (Figure 2d, top;
Supplementary Table 4).

Author Manuscript

To discover new genes, we next examined the 122 regions without previously documented
SCNA targets. The most significantly enriched literature term associated with the
amplification peaks was “apoptosis” (Figure 2d, bottom; Supplementary Table 4). Two of
the five known anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family21 (MCL1 and BCL2L1) are in
amplification peaks. Two of 11 pro-apoptotic members (BOK and BBC3) were also found
among deletion peaks, for a total of four of the 16 known BCL2 family members, with antiapoptotic genes amplified but not deleted and vice versa for pro-apoptotic genes (Figure 3a;
p = 3e-10). Although some BCL2 family members are known to be translocation and point
mutation targets22,23,24,25,26, pathway dysregulation by copy-number change has not been

well-described. Below, we describe functional validation that MCL1 and BCL2L1 are targets
of amplifications that encompass them.
The second-ranking term among amplification peaks without known targets was “NF-κB”,
reflecting a preponderance of members of this pathway (TRAF6, IKBKB, IKBKG, IRAK1,
and RIPK1; p = 0.001 for pathway enrichment27) and consistent with an emerging
recognition of its importance in multiple cancer types28,29,30.

Author Manuscript

Because some gene families may have been missed by GRAIL, we separately analyzed gene
ontology (GO) terms for association with amplification peaks (data not shown). We
identified significant enrichment of genes associated with “molecular adaptor activity” (GO:
0060090, p=4e-10), including IRS2, GRB2, GRB7, GAB2, GRAP, TRAF2, TRAF6, and
CRKL. IRS2 and GAB2 are known to be transforming when overexpressed31,32, and CRKL
has been reported as an essential gene among cells in which it is amplified33.
Amplifications of MCL1 and BCL2L1 are associated with MCL1 and BCL2L1 dependence
MCL1 is one of nine genes in an amplification peak in cytoband 1q21.2 (Figure 3b and
Supplementary Table 2) with focal amplifications observed in 10.9% of cancers across
multiple tissue types. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the MCL1 region in lung
and breast cancers revealed much higher rates of focal amplification (Supplementary Figure
4a–b). Amplifications of 1q21.2 were previously reported in lung adenocarcinoma and
melanoma7,34,35, but the peak regions in those studies contained 86, 36 and 53 genes,
respectively.

Author Manuscript

We examined whether cell growth depends upon MCL1 in the presence of gene
amplification by measuring the rate of change in cell number after activating an inducible
shRNA against MCL1 in cells with and without 1q21.2 amplification. We observed a more
pronounced reduction in proliferation rates among four MCL1-amplified cell lines,
compared to three MCL1 non-amplified control cell lines (p = 0.05; Figure 3c) (all achieved
>70% knockdown; Supplementary Figure 4c). Reducing the expression of 6 of the other
genes (all by >70%; Supplementary Figure 4d) within the 1q21.2 amplicon in NCI-H2110
cells produced no significant effects (Figure 3d). Similar effects were observed following
MCL1 depletion with multiple shRNAs and siRNAs (Supplementary Figure 4e). Growth of
NCI-H2110 xenografts were also inhibited by induction of anti-MCL1 shRNA (Figure 3e).

Author Manuscript

BCL2L1 is one of five genes in a peak region of amplification on 20q11.21 (Supplementary
Figure 5a). Amplifications of this region have been previously noted in lung cancer36, giantcell tumor of bone37, and embryonic stem cell lines (the latter also amplifying a region
including BCL2)38,39, but functional validation of BCL2L1 as a gene targeted by these
amplifications has not been reported. We examined BCL2L1 dependency using shRNA
against BCL2L1 in cells with and without 20q11.21 amplification. We observed a more
pronounced reduction in proliferation rates among six BCL2L1-amplified lines (including
SKLU1, which was MCL1-independent), compared to seven BCL2L1 non-amplified lines (p
= 0.006; Figure 3f). These decreased proliferative rates were associated with increased
apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 5b).

Author Manuscript

We then sought to explore how amplification of these BCL2 family members might act in
cancer by examining other SCNAs found in cancers carrying MCL1 or BCL2L1
amplifications. The most frequent additional focal SCNA in these cancers was amplification
of the region carrying MYC (62% and 69%, respectively). BCL2 has previously been shown
to reduce MYC-induced apoptosis in lymphoid cells40. We found that over-expression of
MCL1 and BCL2L1 in immortalized bronchial epithelial cells also reduces MYC-induced
apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 5c–d). Oncogenic roles for MCL1and BCL2L1 have been
previously suggested by reports of increased rates of lymphoma and leukemia in transgenic
mice41,42. Somatic amplification of MCL1 and BCL2L1 may therefore be a common
mechanism for cancers, including carcinomas, to increase cell survival.
The vast majority of significant focal SCNAs in each cancer type are prevalent across
other types

Author Manuscript

Our analysis of a large number of cancer types with a high-resolution platform afforded an
opportunity to quantify the degree to which significant focal SCNAs are shared across
cancer types. We performed separate analyses of each of the 17 cancer types represented by
at least 40 samples and compared the significant SCNAs to those from a pooled analysis of
the remaining samples, excluding the cancer type in question.

Author Manuscript

The majority of focal SCNAs identified in any one of these 17 cancer types are also found in
the pooled analysis excluding that cancer type (median 79% overlap, versus 10% for
randomly permuted regions, p < 0.001; Figure 4) and, indeed, in the 158 regions from the
overall pool. Nonetheless, cancer type-restricted analyses identified an additional 199
significant SCNAs (145 regions of amplification, 54 regions of deletion, Supplementary
Table 5). (These exclude 79 regions of amplification on chromosome 12 found only in
dedifferentiated liposarcomas and likely to be related to the ring chromosomes in that
disease43). However, even many of these regions were found to occur in more than one
cancer type (median two). As would be expected, the 158 regions in the pooled analysis
were found in more cancer types (median five) and were better localized (median size 1.5
Mb vs. 11 Mb in the lineage-restricted analyses).
Arm-level alterations, like focal SCNAs, tend to be shared among multiple cancer types
(Supplementary Note 4). Prior studies have demonstrated a tendency for cancers of similar
developmental lineages to exhibit similar recurrent arm-level SCNAs44. We found that this
tendency was much more apparent for arm-level than focal SCNAs (see Supplementary
Note 6), suggesting that arm-level SCNAs are shaped to a greater extent by developmental
context.

Discussion
This study represents the largest analysis to date of high-resolution copy-number profiles of
cancer specimens. Several features of the copy-number landscape apply to the vast majority
of cancer types. There is a strikingly high prevalence of arm-level SCNAs4,5,6, which likely
reflects the ease with which such mutational events occur compared to focal events45,46. The
analysis also reveals a strong tendency for significant focal SCNAs in one cancer type to be
also found in multiple others.

Author Manuscript

We identified a total of 357 significant regions of focal SCNA, including 158 regions in the
pooled analysis and 199 regions in analyses of individual cancer types. These are surely
underestimates of the number of regions that are significantly altered in cancer. Many cancer
types were represented by relatively few samples; others were not represented at all. Some
SCNAs were missed due to the resolution limit of the array platform. Further efforts will be
needed to characterize larger numbers of cancer genomes at higher resolution to create a
comprehensive catalog of the significant SCNAs and define their occurrence in difference
cancer types.

Author Manuscript

A key challenge is to identify the cancer gene targets of each of these SCNAs. Fewer than
one-quarter of the 158 common peak regions are associated with previously validated targets
of SCNAs in human cancer. While a subset of the SCNAs may represent deletion events that
are tolerated but not causally involved in cancer (as suggested by the correlation with genepoor regions) or frequent due to mechanistic bias (e.g. associated with fragile sites)47, many
more cancer-causing genes are likely to be found through analysis of SCNAs. The GRAIL
analysis of our peak regions points to more than a dozen likely candidates, while the
functional analysis of MCL1 and BCL2L1 strongly implicates these genes as amplification
targets. Moreover, some SCNAs may contain multiple functional targets10.
Identification of the target genes will require both genomic and functional studies. For focal
events, the copy-number profiles of additional samples at higher resolution can help narrow
the lists of candidates. Nucleotide sequencing may identify point mutations, especially in the
case of heterozygous deletions. Because overlapping SCNAs in different cancer types may
target different genes, all candidates should be functionally tested separately in each cancer
type in appropriate model systems.

Author Manuscript

While many canonical oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are known to be altered
across multiple cancer types and functionally relevant in model systems of diverse tissue
origins1, it has not been clear whether these genes are typical or represent a discovery bias
toward genes relevant to multiple cancer types. By studying a large number of cancers of
multiple types, we have found that most of the significant SCNAs within any single cancer
type tend to be found in other cancer types as well. Similar findings for point mutations and
translocations would suggest that the appearance of tremendous diversity across cancer
genomes may reflect combinations of a limited number of functionally relevant events.

Methods summary

Author Manuscript

DNA extracted from cancer specimens and normal tissue was labeled and hybridized to the
Affymetrix 250K Sty I array to obtain signal intensities and genotype calls. Signal
intensities were normalized against data from 1480 normal samples. Copy-number profiles
were inferred using GLAD48 and changes of > 0.1 copies in either direction were called
SCNAs. The significance of focal SCNAs (covering < 0.5 chromosome arms) was
determined using GISTIC18, with modifications to score SCNAs directly proportional to
amplitude and to allow summation of non-overlapping deletions affecting the same gene.
Peak region boundaries were determined so that the change in the GISTIC score from peak
to boundary had < 5% likelihood of occurring by random fluctuation. P-values for Figures
2b and 4 were determined by comparing the gene densities of SCNAs and fraction overlap
of peak regions respectively to the same quantities calculated from random permutations of
the locations of these SCNAs and peak regions. RNAi was performed by inducible and
stable expression of shRNA lentiviral vectors and by siRNA transfection. Proliferation in
inducible shRNA experiments was measured in triplicate every half-hour on 96-well plates
by a real time electric sensing system (ACEA Bioscience) and in stable shRNA expression
and siRNA transfection experiments by CellTiterGlo (Promega). Apoptosis was measured
by immunoblot against cleaved PARP and FACS analysis of cells stained with antibody to
annexin V and propidium iodide. Tumor growth in nude mice was measured by caliper
twice weekly. Expression of MYC, MCL1, and BCL2L1 was performed with retroviral
vectors in lung epithelial cells immortalized by introduction of SV40 and hTERT49.
Full methods are described in Supplementary Methods.

Identification of significant arm-level and focal SCNAs across cancer. a) Length distribution
of SCNAs. b) Length-adjusted Z-scores for gains (x-axis) and losses (y-axis) of indicated
chromosome arms. Arms in red, blue, purple, and black exhibit significant gain, loss, both,
or neither, respectively. c) GISTIC q-values (x-axis) for deletions (left, blue) and
amplifications (right, red) are plotted across the genome (y-axis). Known or putative gene
targets within the peak regions (TRB@, indicated by an asterisk, is immediately adjacent)
are indicated for the 20 most significant peaks; values in parentheses represent the number
of genes in the peak region.

Characteristics of significant focal SCNAs. a) Genes are ranked by the amount of genome
occupied. Local gene density is normalized against the genome-wide average. b) Average
gene density as a function of copy number. c) GRAIL analysis20 p-values, plotted for each
peak region, reflect the similarity between genes in that region compared to genes in all
other regions. Increasing significance is plotted towards the top and reflects greater
similarity. Histograms of p-values are displayed for randomly placed regions (“Permuted
controls”). d) The literature terms most associated with genes in either deletion or
amplification peaks, but not both.
