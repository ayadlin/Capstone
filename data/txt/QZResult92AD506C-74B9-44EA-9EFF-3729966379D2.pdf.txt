ABSTRACT
Enhanced rRNA synthesis is a downstream effect of many of the signaling
pathways that are aberrantly activated in cancer, such as the PI3K/mTOR and MAP
kinase pathways. Recently, two new rRNA synthesis inhibitors have demonstrated
therapeutic effects on cancer cells while sparing normal cells. One of them,
CX-5461, is currently in phase 1 clinical trials for hematological malignancies. Here,
we investigate the effectiveness of transient treatment with this drug on acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Our results show that short exposure to CX-5461
followed by drug washout is sufficient to induce persistent G2 cell-cycle arrest and
irreversible commitment to cell death, in spite of rRNA synthesis returning to normal
within 24 hours of drug washout. The magnitude of cell death after transient exposure
is similar to continuous exposure, but the time to cell death is relatively delayed with
transient exposure. In this report, we also investigate rational drug combinations
that can potentiate the effect of continuous CX-5461 treatment. We show that the
checkpoint abrogator UCN-01 can relieve CX-5461-induced G2 arrest and potentiate
the cytotoxic effects of CX-5461. Finally, we show that ERK1/2 is activated upon
CX-5461 treatment, and that pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2 leads to enhanced
cell death in combination with CX-5461. In summary, our results provide evidence
for the effectiveness of CX-5461 pulse treatment, which may minimize drug related
toxicity, and evidence for enhanced effectiveness of CX-5461 in combination with
other targeted agents.

of mature ribosome from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [4].
Nucleolar stress caused by drugs or environmental factors
can lead to unraveling of the nucleolus and the release of
nucleolar proteins into the nucleoplasm. Rubbi et al. [5]
first proposed that impairment of nucleolar function in
response to cellular stress leads to p53 activation, which
in turn leads to cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis.
Ribosome biogenesis is a highly coordinated
process that is regulated by tumor suppressor proteins and
oncogenes [6]. Morphological and structural changes in
the nucleolus were one of the earliest reported markers in
cancer. RNA polymerase I (RNA pol I) is responsible for
the synthesis of pre-rRNA. Elevated RNA pol I activity
due to increased growth and protein synthesis demand is
a hallmark of cancer [6, 7]. In fact, some of the major

INTRODUCTION
The primary role of the nucleolus is to synthesize
ribosomes. However, identification of the nucleolar
proteome showed that a majority of nucleolar proteins
have functions unrelated to ribosome biogenesis, such
as cell-cycle regulation and stress response, [1, 2] and
subsequent studies have discovered novel functions
for the nucleolus both in normal and disease states [3].
The nucleolus is a dynamic structure which is formed
by the act of making ribosome. Nucleolar stress can be
caused by inhibition of any of the many steps involved
in ribosome biogenesis including pre-ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) synthesis, rRNA processing, and assembly of
ribosomal proteins on nascent rRNA transcripts and export

irrevocably induce cell death in ALL cells. Cells were
treated with 250 nM CX-5461 or DMSO for 24 hours,
washed twice in the culture medium and suspended in drug
free medium. We measured cell proliferation using the
colorimetric MTS assay at day 1 and 3 after resuspension.
All cell lines showed a time dependent reduction in cell
proliferation in washout cells relative to control treated
cells (Figure 1A). To assess the extent to which reduced
proliferation was due to induction of cell death (as opposed
to growth arrest only), we measured cell death at day 3
after washout using FACS after staining with propidium
iodide (PI). All cell lines showed significant reduction
in proportion of live cells (i.e., PI negative) in washout
cells compared to DMSO treated controls after 3 days
(Figure 1B). To investigate if a shorter incubation with
CX-5461 would still result in cytotoxicity, we exposed the
cells to CX-5461 for 3 hours and 5 hours. We measured
cell viability using trypan blue 4 days after washout. All
cell lines showed a reduction in viability in drug washout
cells (Figure 1C). We then investigated if transient
exposure would lead to cytotoxicity in primary patient
samples. We have previously shown that normal bone
marrow cells show minimal cell death when treated with
1 μM CX-5461 for two days [19]. For transient exposure,
we treated patient samples (n = 3) for 5 hours with 1 μM
CX-5461, washed them twice and resuspended in drug free
media. Cell death was measured with PI staining. All three
samples showed reduced viability in drug washout, and to
a similar extent as with continuous treatment compared to
DMSO treated controls (Figure 1D). Taken together, these
results show that short exposure to CX-5461 is sufficient
to induce cell death in acute leukemia cells.

signaling pathways deregulated in cancers directly
affect ribosome biogenesis. Among them, c-Myc and
PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling directly regulate multiple
steps in ribosome biogenesis [8, 9]. As ribosome
biogenesis is an essential cellular process for normal
cells, its therapeutic targeting in cancer seems unlikely.
However, recently, a class of drugs targeting rDNA
transcription has shown promise as novel cancer treatment
in pre-clinical models [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. These
studies have shown that therapeutically inhibiting rDNA
transcription with these drugs selectively kills cancer cells
and spares normal cells.
CX-5461 is the first potent and selective inhibitor of
RNA pol I transcription [16]. Recently, the rRNA synthesis
inhibitors, CX-5461 and BMH-21, have shown therapeutic
potential in different cancer models [10, 13, 17]. These
drugs have distinct mechanisms of action of inhibiting
rRNA synthesis. BMH-21 was initially discovered
as an activator of p53, and was later found to induce
nucleolar stress by inhibiting RNA pol I binding to the
rDNA promoter and decreased rRNA synthesis [13, 18].
In contrast, CX-5461 inhibits the interaction between
SL1 and rDNA thereby preventing the formation of preinitiation complex. Bywater et al. [10] showed therapeutic
potential of CX-5461 treatment in mouse model of
melanoma and MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia. Their
work showed that nucleolar stress caused by CX-5461
selectively led to p53 activation and subsequent apoptosis
in cancer cells. Recently, we have shown that CX-5461
arrests acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in
G2 phase and induces apoptosis in p53 independent
manner [19].
In recent years, potent but transient inhibition of
BCR-ABL kinase in CML, and PI3K in breast cancer
models has been shown to be an effective therapeutic
strategy [20, 21, 22]. Here, we investigated the cellular
response to transient inhibition of rRNA synthesis with
CX-5461 treatment. We found that short exposure to
CX-5461 produces similar effects as seen with continuous
treatment. Despite reactivation of rRNA synthesis
activity within 24 h of drug washout, transient and potent
inhibition of rRNA synthesis with CX-5461 was sufficient
to commit ALL cells to irreversible cell death. Apart from
acute treatment strategy, we also investigated rational
drug combinations that can enhance the cytotoxicity of
continuous CX-5461 treatment. In this report we analyzed
the effect of inhibiting cellular pathways activated by
CX-5461 treatment. We showed that checkpoint kinase
inhibitor UCN-01 and MAPK pathway inhibitors enhance
CX-5461 mediated cytotoxicity.

rRNA synthesis recovers in drug washout cells
To further investigate changes induced by transient
treatment, we treated SEM and NALM-6 cells with
CX-5461 for 3 hours, washed twice and resuspended
them in drug free media. We then investigated the
effects of drug washout on cell-cycle distribution,
rRNA synthesis and cell viability. Cell-cycle results
show that 24 hours after washout (CX w/o), cells
show an increase in the G2/M population compared
to control treated cells, although the magnitude of
the increase is less than that seen with continuously
treated cells (CX-5461) (Figure 2A and Supplementary
Figure 1A). We used 45S pre-rRNA transcript levels,
which are known to have a very short half-life (several
minutes), as a measure of the rate of rRNA synthesis.
We have shown previously that 250 and 500 nM CX5461 reduces pre-rRNA synthesis by more than 50% by
3 hours in SEM and NALM-6 cells respectively [19].
We first measured 45S pre-rRNA levels at 3 hours after
CX-5461 treatment to confirm inhibition of RNA pol
I transcription (Supplementary Figure 1B). The cells
were then washed and suspended in drug free media
for 24 hours to check if pre-rRNA synthesis recovered

or DMSO for 5 hours. After 5 hours the CX-5461 treated cells were washed, incubated with either DMSO (w/o) or 1 μM CX-5461 (CX);
the DMSO treated cells were washed and incubated in DMSO (DMSO). After 2 days, cell death was measured using PI staining. All three

following washout. Both cell lines showed significant
pre-rRNA synthesis inhibition at 3 hours (CX 3 h) and
almost complete recovery at 24 hours after washout
(CX w/o) (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1B).
Ribosome biogenesis is a highly coordinated process
and inhibition of rRNA synthesis can lead to prerRNA processing defects. In order to make sure that
the increase in the levels of 45S pre-rRNA in drug
washout cells is not due to pre-rRNA processing
defects, we labeled SEM cells with ethynyl uridine
(EU) for 30 min followed by chase in EU free media.
RNA was isolated at 0 and 3 hours after EU washout

from the cells. Newly synthesized EU labeled
transcripts were isolated as described in materials and
methods. Our results show no difference in the levels
of newly transcribed 45S pre-rRNA in DMSO and
CX-5461 washout cells at 0 hour (Figure 2C). Moreover,
3 hours after chase, levels of the EU labeled 45S prerRNA decreases substantially. The decrease was similar
in both DMSO and CX-5461 washout cells suggesting
efficient processing of 45S pre-rRNA transcript under
both conditions.
Next, we measured cell viability of these cells after
washout at day 1 and 3 using trypan blue. The results show

lead to increased cell death. Checkpoint kinases 1 and
2 (CHK1/2) are downstream effectors of ATM/ATR
pathway and are activated upon CX-5461 treatment
[19]. UCN-01, a staurosporine analogue, is a potent
inhibitor of CHK1/2 and sensitizes tumor cells to
genotoxic agents by abrogating G2 arrest induced by
these drugs [23, 24]. Although UCN-01 is an inhibitor
of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of enzymes, G2
checkpoint abrogation by inhibiting checkpoint kinases
play a major role in its  anticancer activity [25, 26, 27].
To determine if UCN-01 can abrogate CX-5461 induced
G2 arrest, we pre-treated cells with UCN-01 followed
by continuous CX-5461 treatment for 24 hours. Cellcycle analysis shows that CX-5461 treatment induced
G2 arrest in SEM, KOPN-8 and NALM-6 cells. This
arrest was completely abolished by UCN-01 pretreatment (Figure 4A). We then investigated if UCN01 treatment will enhance the cytotoxicity of CX-5461
as seen previously in combination with ATR inhibitor.
We pre-treated cells with UCN-01 for 1 hour followed
by CX-5461 and measured cell viability using trypan
blue. Combination treatment with CX-5461 and UCN01 significantly reduced cell viability in all three cell
lines compared to CX-5461 or UCN-01 treatment alone
(Figure 4B).

that transient inhibition of rRNA synthesis substantially
decreased cell viability (Figure 2D). These results confirm
that despite reactivation of rRNA synthesis activity within
24 hours of drug washout, short-term rRNA synthesis
inhibition with CX-5461 was sufficient to inhibit cell
cycling and viability. We have previously shown that p53
levels were increased upon 24 hours CX-5461 treatment
in p53 wild-type cell lines, although cell-cycle arrest
and apoptotic effects were p53-independent [19]. To
investigate if p53 levels remains elevated in CX-5461
washout cells, we measured p53 and phospho-p53 levels
in drug treated and drug washout cells (Figure 2E). As
shown previously [19], there was no increase in p53 levels
in SEM cells (p53 mutant cell line). In NALM-6 cells
(p53 wild-type cell line), there was an increase in p53 and
phospho-p53 levels initially at 3 hours after drug treatment
but drug washout resulted in a decrease in p53 levels when
measured after 24 hours.

Washout effectively removes residual drug from
the culture medium
We considered the possibility that the cytotoxic
effect seen after drug washout is due to incomplete
removal of the drug. To test for any residual drug, the
cell culture supernatant (S) from drug treated cells after
two washes was transferred to previously untreated
cells (naïve) (Figure 3A). These cells were allowed to
grow for three days and cell viability was measured by
trypan blue staining. Our results show no reduction in
viability of cells incubated in media from drug wash
out cells similar to untreated control cells (Figure 3B).
These results show effective removal of the drug from
the culture media following two washes. We further
tested the effect of washout itself on cell viability. SEM
cells were treated with CX-5461 or DMSO for 3 hours
followed by two washes in drug free media. As shown
in Figure 3C, washout has no effect on cell viability as
DMSO washout cell show similar viability as control
unwashed cells. Also, these results suggest a lag in cell
death in drug washout cells compared to continuously
treated cells (Figure 3C).

CX-5461 activates MAPK signaling pathway
As ribosome biogenesis is a highly regulated
process, we investigated other signaling pathways
activated by rRNA synthesis inhibition. We incubated a
human phospho-kinase protein array with equal amounts
of cell lysates from SEM cells treated with CX-5461 or
DMSO for one day. CX-5461 treated cells showed an
increase in pERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), pCHK2 (T68)
and HSP60 levels (Figure 5A). We further confirmed the
activation of ERK1/2 with western blot from CX-5461
treated SEM, NALM-6 and KOPN-8 cells (Figure 5B).
We investigated if pharmacological inhibition of the
MEK/ERK signaling pathway would abrogate
CX-5461 induced ERK1/2 activation and potentiate the
effect of rRNA synthesis inhibition. We treated SEM
cells with MEK1/2 inhibitor, U-0126, in combination
with CX-5461 for one day. Western blot results show
that U-0126 reduced the levels of pERK induced
by CX-5461 treatment (Figure 6A). More-over, cell
viability was substantially reduced in cells treated with
a combination of U-0126 and CX-5461 compared to
CX-5461 or U-0126 alone (Figure 6B). To further
confirm that treatment with MEK/ERK inhibitor can
enhance CX-5461 cytotoxic effect, we treated ALL cell
lines with another MEK1/2 inhibitor, trametinib. Cells
were treated with 150 nM trametinib in combination
with CX-5461 for 2 days and cell viability was measured
by trypan blue staining. As seen with U-0126, trametinib
treated cells show significant increase in cell death in

UCN-01 treatment relieves cell-cycle arrest and
shows enhanced cell killing in combination with
CX-5461
In addition to transient treatment with CX-5461,
we investigated other rational drug combinations
that can potentiate the effect of continuous CX-5461
treatment. We have previously shown that CX-5461
activates ATM/ATR pathway in acute leukemia,
arrests cells in G2 phase and synergizes with ATR
inhibitor in killing these cells [19]. We hypothesized
that abolishing cell-cycle arrest in the G2 phase would
result in inadequate recovery from cellular stress and

ABL inhibition [20, 21]. Dasatinib, a second-generation
BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, with a short half-life of
approximately 3–5 hours has been shown to be clinically
effective with once-daily administration despite only
intermittent BCR-ABL inhibition [28]. More-over,
tolerability of once-daily dosing was superior to the
twice-daily schedule even with partial kinase inhibition.
Recently, transient inhibition of PI3K in breast cancer cells
was shown to be an effective therapeutic strategy [22].
Yung et al. [29] have reported that low dose
actinomycin D treatment for short duration followed by
washout leads to complete recovery of cell growth and
rRNA synthesis, whereas higher dose or longer duration
lead to irreversible inhibition of rRNA synthesis and
cell proliferation. Recently, Ma et al. [30] showed
similar results on cell-cycle arrest with actinomycin
D treatment as seen with CX-5461. But in contrast to our
results, they showed more than 80% inhibition of rRNA

DISCUSSION
In cancer therapy, continuous target inhibition has
been seen as a pre-requisite for maximum clinical impact.
Our results show that transient treatment with CX-5461
induces cellular changes similar to continuous treatment,
albeit with a lag period. Importantly, after drug washout,
cells are irreversibly committed to cell death despite
complete recovery from rRNA synthesis inhibition. This
suggests that short term blockade of rRNA synthesis is
sufficient to irreversibly inhibit cellular proliferation. The
rationale for continuous target inhibition for maximum
efficacy has been challenged in chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML). A series of studies have shown that cytotoxicity
in CML cells can be achieved with transient potent BCR-

synthesis at 20 hours post washout after a 2 and 4 hour
actinomycin D treatment. Compared to their results, we
achieved 50% inhibition in 3 hours with CX-5461. It is
possible that higher inhibition may lead to irreversible
repression of rRNA synthesis. Another explanation may
be the use of a solid cancer cell line in their study. This
difference may also be due to a different mechanism of
action. Actinomycin D is a RNA polymerase inhibitor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which intercalates into GC rich regions of rDNA and
shows selectivity for RNA pol I at low dose. It inhibits
Pol I transcription during the elongation step whereas
CX-5461 disrupts the binding of the SL1 transcription
factor to rDNA promoter, which inhibits initiation of
rRNA synthesis by the Pol I complex. Nevertheless, in our
case, recovery from rRNA synthesis after washout did not
change the eventual fate of these cells.

One of the most studied effects of nucleolar stress
is the stabilization of p53 resulting in cell-cycle arrest
and/or apoptosis [5]. ARF tumor suppressor has been
shown to translocate to the nucleoplasm in response
to nucleolar stress where it inhibits the binding of
E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2, to p53 resulting in p53
stabilization [31]. Recent reports have shown that drugs
targeting rRNA synthesis activate a p53-dependent
apoptosis pathway in cancer cells displaying high rate of
ribosome biogenesis [10, 32]. Although p53 activation
upon ribosomal stress is well established, there are reports

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that provide evidence for a p53-independent mechanism
that links nucleolar stress to inhibition of cell proliferation.
We have previously shown that rRNA synthesis inhibition
by CX-5461 activates ATM/ATR kinase pathway leading
to CDC2 phosphorylation, G2 arrest and apoptosis in
both p53 mutant and wild-type acute leukemia cells
[19]. In line with that report, here we showed that p53
is activated upon 3 hours treatment in p53 wild-type cell
line but the levels go down within 24 hours after drug
washout suggesting p53-independent downstream effects
of CX-5461. Donati et al. [33] showed that knockdown

of POLR1A gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of
RNA polymerase I, in p53 null cells leads to cell-cycle
arrest due to the down-regulation of transcription factor
E2F-1. Ribosomal stress can also reduce the levels of
PIM1 kinase leading to inhibition of cell proliferation in
p53 null cells by stabilizing cell-cycle inhibitor p27kip1, a
target of PIM1 kinase [34]. This reduction in PIM1 levels
can be seen as early as 3 hours after rRNA synthesis
inhibition, a time frame similar to one used in this study.
Many proteins involved in stress response,
proliferation and cell-cycle progression are sequestered
in the nucleolus (away from their site of action or
interacting partners) thereby controlling their action [31].
At the onset of mitosis, rRNA synthesis is suppressed and
nucleolus is disassembled in a highly regulated fashion.
Many of the nucleolar proteins are phosphorylated by
CDC2/Cyclin B complex (including members of rRNA
synthesis and processing machinery) and are dissociated

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from the nucleolus [35]. One interesting question
then is why transient inhibition of rRNA synthesis by
CX-5461 affects cellular proliferation but suppression of
rRNA synthesis during mitosis does not. We speculate
that the untimely release of proteins sequestered in the
nucleolus, upon drug treatment, results in cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis. For example, tumor suppressor
protein ARF is sequestered in the nucleolus in
association with NPM1 [36]. On nucleolar disruption
by drug treatment or radiation, ARF translocates to
the nucleoplasm, binds to E3 ligase MDM2 thereby
preventing p53 ubiquitination. Elevated p53 levels then
lead to cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the
level of cellular insult [31]. Interestingly, ARF levels
decrease during mitosis and recover in early G1 phase
[37]. ARF has also been shown to inhibit growth in
p53-independent manner by arresting cells in G2 phase
which subsequently leads to apoptosis [38]. Also, we

cannot rule out the possibility that CX-5461 has other
targets in the cells which stay inhibited even after drug
removal.
We have previously shown that caffeine and an
ATR inhibitor can relieve CX-5461 induced G2 arrest,
eventually leading to enhanced apoptosis [19]. Here,
we showed that CX-5461 induced G2 arrest can be
abolished by the checkpoint inhibitor UCN-01 [23,
26, 39] which also leads to enhanced cell death. This
suggests that relieving G2 arrest by checkpoint kinase
inhibitor UCN-01 provides no opportunity to the cells
to overcome stress induced by CX-5461 treatment. As
UCN-01 has been shown to enhance the cytotoxicity of
radiation and chemotherapy, combination treatment with
UCN-01 represents a therapeutic strategy that can
potentiate the effectiveness of CX-5461 [40, 41].
More-over, CX-5461 treatment activates MAP kinase
pathway and MEK inhibitors showed increased cell
killing in combination with this rRNA synthesis inhibitor
(Supplementary Figure 1C). In summary, our data suggests
that transient inhibition of rRNA synthesis is sufficient to
activate irreversible changes in cell survival and supports
the potential for pulse treatment strategy in treating ALL
with CX-5461, which in turn may minimize drug related
toxicity. Also, we have provided in vitro evidence that
rational combinations of CX-5461 with other inhibitors
of survival pathways activated upon inhibition of rRNA
synthesis can potentiate its effectiveness and should be
further investigated in an in vivo model system.

drug naïve cells, CX-5461 treated cells were washed
twice and suspended in drug free media. The cells were
centrifuged again, supernatant were collected and this
supernatant was added to drug naïve cells (denoted as
“S” in Figure 3B). Cell viability was measured using
trypan blue staining or flow cytometry of PI stained cells.
CX-5461 was purchased from Xcess Biosciences; UCN01 and U-0126 from Sigma-Aldrich; Trametinib from LC
laboratories.

Cell proliferation
Cells were treated with DMSO or CX-5461
for 24 hours, washed twice and equal numbers of
cells were seeded in 96 well plates. Cell proliferation
was measured at 0 hour, 24 hours and 72 hours after
washout using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution
Cell Proliferation solution (MTS reagent) (Promega).
MTS reagent was added to each well and incubated for
1 hour at 37oC in dark and absorbance was recorded at
490 nm using Bio-Rad microplate reader. Results were
background subtracted and normalized to DMSO treated
control.

Phospho kinase proteome array and western
blotting

Scholar Program (P.B.). The Giant Food Pediatric
Oncology Research Fund supported use of the
FACSCalibur.

Phospho kinase levels were measured using
Proteome Profiler Human Phospho-Kinase Array kit
as suggested by the manufacturer (R&D System).
Briefly, cells were lysed and protein concentrations
were measured. Each phospho kinase array was
incubated with 200 μg of protein lysate from DMSO or
CX-5461 treated cells. Array was developed according to
manufacturer’s instructions. For western blots, cell lysates
were run on SDS Polyacrylamide gel and transferred to
PVDF membrane. Membrane was blocked with 5%
milk and incubated with primary antibody against ERK,
Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) and
β-Tubulin. Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology.

Pre-rRNA synthesis and processing of 45S transcript
was determined by Click-iT® Nascent RNA Capture
Kit (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s
instructions [42]. Briefly, 0.4 mM ethynyl uridine (EU)
was incorporated into SEM cells for 30 min. Cells were
allowed to recover in EU free media and RNA was
isolated at 0 and 3 hours after washout. EU-labeled RNA
was biotinylated and captured on streptavidin magnetic
beads according to the protocol. cDNA synthesis was
performed directly on the beads. Relative levels of 45S
pre-rRNA were measured by qPCR at each time point. All
experiments were performed in triplicates.

Cells were treated with indicated concentrations of
CX-5461. A portion of cells were harvested after 3 hours
drug exposure and RNA was isolated. Rest of the cells
were washed twice and reseeded in drug-free culture
media. RNA was isolated, using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen),
from these cells after 24 hours. qPCR was performed using
SYBR Green master mix and run on a CFX96 Bio-Rad real
time PCR machine. Primer sequences for 45S pre-rRNA
are forward 5′ CCGCGCTCTACCTTACCTACCT 3′,
reverse 5′ GCATGGCTTAATCTTTGAGACAAG 3′; for
βActin are forward 5′ CGTCACCAACTGGGACGACA
3′, reverse 5′ CTTCTCGCGGTTGGCCTTGG 3′.
Experiments were repeated three times. Results were
normalized to GAPDH and β Actin expression for each
sample.
