BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with response rate, resectability, and survival after
cisplatin/interferon a-2b/doxorubicin/5-fluorouracil (PIAF) combination therapy in patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular
carcinoma. METHODS: The study included 2 groups of patients treated with conventional high-dose PIAF (n 5 84) between 1994
and 2003 and those without hepatitis or cirrhosis treated with modified PIAF (n 5 33) between 2003 and 2012. Tolerance of chemotherapy, best radiographic response, rate of conversion to curative surgery, and overall survival were analyzed and compared
between the 2 groups, and multivariate and logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of response and survival.
RESULTS: The modified PIAF group had a higher median number of PIAF cycles (4 versus 2, P 5.049), higher objective response rate
(36% versus 15%, P 5.013), higher rate of conversion to curative surgery (33% versus 10%, P 5.004), and longer median overall survival
(21.3 versus 10.6 months, P 5.002). Multivariate analyses confirmed that positive hepatitis B serology (hazard ratio [HR] 5 1.68; 95%
confidence interval [CI] 5 1.08-2.59) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status  2 (HR 5 1.75; 95% CI 5 1.04-2.93)
were associated with worse survival whereas curative surgical resection after PIAF treatment (HR 5 0.15; 95% CI 5 0.07-0.35)
was associated with improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, the modified
PIAF regimen in patients with no hepatitis or cirrhosis is associated with improved response, resectability, and survival. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is potentially curable by surgical resection,1,2 local ablation,3,4 or liver transplantation.5,6 However, most patients with HCC present with unresectable disease accompanied by background liver disease
that has an independent effect on patients’ survival. Therefore, effective neoadjuvant therapeutic options are limited for
these patients.
Conventionally, HCC has been considered a chemotherapy-resistant tumor, and numerous clinical trials of a wide
variety of chemotherapeutic and hormonal agents have failed to show satisfactory results.7 However, multiple expert panels concluded that the underlying liver disease is a major confounding factor that independently affects HCC treatment
outcome. This fact is very pertinent to failed chemotherapy trials in HCC, because the majority of patients did not tolerate
full doses and regular schedules of chemotherapy, and therefore, the poor outcome and short survival were related, in part,
to deterioration of the underlying liver disease. Notably, the PIAF regimen, consisting of cisplatin, interferon a-2b, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), produced a relatively high objective response rate in the initial phase 2 study of this

regimen for patients with unresectable HCC.8 Although a
phase 3 clinical trial comparing PIAF with doxorubicin did
not show an overall survival benefit of PIAF,9 the objective
response rate of the regimen was confirmed. However, the
potential neoadjuvant role of PIAF in unresectable HCC
remained an open question because the populations in previous studies had high prevalences (> 80%) of cirrhosis
and hepatitis B,8-11 both of which have been reported to
negatively affect the course of intensive chemotherapy and
ultimately patients’ surgical candidacy.10,12 Since 1994,
our group has prospectively followed up all the patients
who have received PIAF treatment at our institution for initially unresectable HCC. From January 1994 through May
2003, PIAF was administered in the context of an
expanded institutional phase 2 trial. In June 2003, on the
basis of the initial results of our phase 2 trial and that of
another group,8 the patient selection criteria for PIAF and
the PIAF treatment protocol were modified.
The objectives of the current study were to compare
the response rate, resectability, and survival between the
patients treated with the original PIAF regimen and the
optimally selected patients treated with the modified
PIAF regimen and to explore the factors associated with

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center, Houston, Texas, and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
The study population consisted of 2 groups of patients:
the conventional PIAF group (n 5 84) and the modified
PIAF group (n 5 33) (Table 1). The conventional PIAF
group was a prospective cohort in an extended single-arm
institutional phase 2 trial assessing the efficacy of the
PIAF regimen and conducted between January 1994 and
June 2003. The modified PIAF group was a prospective
registry cohort treated with the modified PIAF regimen
between July 2003 and June 2012. We performed a retrospective analysis of both cohorts.
Diagnosis and Assessment of Resectability

HCC was diagnosed by histologic examination of tumor
tissue. Treatment options for every patient were discussed
during a multidisciplinary Liver Tumor Study Group,
3335

Original Article

and resectability was assessed by experienced hepatobiliary
surgeons on the basis of imaging findings (eg, tumor size,
tumor location, tumor distribution, invasion, and presence of extrahepatic disease), function of the underlying
liver, presence of medical comorbidities, and patient performance status.
Indications for PIAF Treatment

General indications for PIAF treatment were as follows:
unresectable advanced HCC, life expectancy more than 12
weeks, platelet count of 100,000/mm3 or greater, absolute
granulocyte count of 1500/mm3 or greater, serum bilirubin
level of 2 mg/dL or less, serum albumin level of 3 g/dL or
greater, serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL or less, normal
cardiac function, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status score 2 or less. Since
June 2003, on the basis of results of the phase 2 trial, we
adopted the following as relative contraindications to PIAF
treatment at our institution: positive hepatitis B serology
(ie, presence of hepatitis B surface antigen or anti-hepatitis
B core antibody) with no ongoing antiviral therapy, positive hepatitis C serology (ie, presence of anti-hepatitis C
antibody), histologic or clinical evidence of established cirrhosis, and ECOG performance status of 2 or greater.
Treatment Protocols

The conventional PIAF regimen consisted of cisplatin at 80
mg/m2 on day 1, interferon a-2b at 5 MU/m2 on days 1
through 4, doxorubicin at 40 mg/m2 on day 1, and 5-FU at
500 mg/m2 over 24 hours on days 1 through 4. The modified PIAF regimen consisted of cisplatin at 20 mg/m2 on
days 1 through 4, interferon a-2b at 4 MU/m2 on days 1
through 4, doxorubicin at 40 mg/m2 on day 1, and 5-FU at
400 mg/m2 as a bolus infusion on days 1 through 4. Each
treatment was repeated every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles. Several patients with good response and tolerance received up
to 2 more cycles of PIAF after completion of the 6 cycles of
PIAF that were part of the planned protocol treatment. In
patients who developed grade 3 or higher drug-related
adverse events, treatment was withheld until the event
resolved to grade 1 or less, and doses were reduced by 25%
in the next cycle. Patients who completed scheduled PIAF
treatment but still had unresectable viable tumors received
additional therapies including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and/or other systemic therapy, in consideration of their oncologic status and physical conditions.
Follow-Up and Evaluation of Response

Liver function tests, electrolytes, and serum alphafetoprotein level were examined every 4 weeks during
3336

PIAF treatment. A baseline computed tomography (CT)
scan was obtained before day 1 of the first PIAF cycle, and
the disease status was assessed by enhanced CT every 8
weeks (5 2 cycles) during PIAF treatment. Response to
chemotherapy determined by an investigator was confirmed by radiologists and described according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).13 Objective response rate was defined as the
percentage of patients who had a complete response or
partial response during PIAF treatment. Toxic effects
were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0, and time to severe
adverse event (grade 3 or higher) was retrospectively
reviewed for every patient.
Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables were compared using the MannWhitney U test, and categorical variables were compared
using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Overall survival was measured from day 1 of the first PIAF cycle to
the date of death or last follow-up. Survival curves were
generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between curves were evaluated using the log-rank test.
To identify prognostic factors for survival, a multivariate regression analysis was performed using the Cox
proportional hazards model with backward elimination
for variables with P < .1 in univariate analysis. To identify
factors associated with an objective response to chemotherapy, a multivariate analysis was performed using the
logistic regression model for clinical variables with P < .1
in univariate analysis. Analyses were performed with IBM
SPSS software (version 19.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). All
statistical tests were 2-sided, and significance was set at
P < .05.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study population are summarized in
Table 1. Compared with the conventional PIAF group,
the modified PIAF group had a younger median age and a
higher proportion of females. Positive hepatitis serology
and liver cirrhosis were significantly less common in the
modified PIAF group, and there was a trend toward better
performance status in the modified PIAF group, reflecting
the modified patient selection criteria and only limited to
patients with well-controlled hepatitis, good liver function, and acceptable physical condition who underwent
the modified PIAF treatment when the relative contraindication factors were present. There were no differences
between the conventional PIAF group and the modified
PIAF group in maximum tumor size, nodal involvement,

Adverse Events, Objective Response Rate, and
Rate of Conversion to Resectability

Outcomes of PIAF treatment are summarized in Table 2
in comparison with reported outcomes in previous studies. The median number of PIAF cycles was significantly
Cancer

September 15, 2013

higher in the modified PIAF group (4 versus 2; P 5 .049).
Although the cumulative incidence of grade 3 or higher
adverse events during PIAF treatment was similar in the 2
groups (58% for conventional PIAF versus 61% for modified PIAF), median number of cycles of PIAF before
occurrence of a grade 3 or higher adverse event was significantly longer in the modified PIAF group (2 cycles versus
1 cycle; P 5 .003). As a result, the modified PIAF regimen
was associated with a higher objective response rate (36%
versus 15%; P 5 .013) and rate of conversion to curative
surgery (33% versus 10%; P 5 .004).
Figure 1 shows cumulative objective response rate
during PIAF treatment. Median time to response was 210
days and the cumulative response rates were estimated as
4.2% at 8 weeks (2 cycles of PIAF), 15.4% at 12 weeks
(3 cycles of PIAF), 22.3% at 16 weeks (4 cycles of PIAF),
31.2% at 20 weeks (5 cycles of PIAF), and 36.9% at
24 weeks (6 cycles of PIAF).
When the cutoff value for number of PIAF cycles
was adjusted from 1 through more than 6, 5 or more
PIAF cycles was associated with the highest odds ratio
(OR) for objective response to chemotherapy
(OR 5 13.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5 4.67-36.7;
P < .01). Multivariate analysis confirmed that 5 or more
PIAF cycles was the only predictor of objective response
to PIAF treatment (OR 5 15.6; 95% CI 5 4.9-49.5;
P < .001) (Table 3). The patients with conversion to curative surgery had a significantly higher median number of

compared with the patients whose disease remained
unresectable, although the median pretreatment tumor
size was similar (108 mm versus 100 mm in median,
P 5 .78).
Treatment After PIAF

Among the 98 unresectable patients after PIAF treatment,
27 (36%) patients in the conventional PIAF group and 11
(50%) patients in the modified PIAF group received additional therapies. However, because of the high rate of
severe adverse event and decreased performance status
associated with PIAF treatment, available therapy was
limited after completion of or failure from the treatment.
Eventually, additional systemic therapy was performed in
23 (30%) patients in the conventional PIAF group and 7
(32%) patients in the modified PIAF group (P 5 .65). A
regimen based on 5-FU or capecitabine was the most
common regimens in either of the groups (87% versus
86%, P 5 1). Sorafenib was used in only 1 patient after
the modified PIAF treatment. TACE was selected in 5
(7%) patients in the conventional PIAF group and 4
(18%) patients in the modified PIAF group, respectively
3338

(P 5 .26). Radioembolization using yttrium-90 was performed for only 1 patient in the modified PIAF group.

Survival

At the time of this analysis, of the 84 patients in the conventional PIAF group, 78 had died, 5 had been lost to followup, and 1 was still alive, with a median follow-up period of
10.3 months (range, 1-211 months). Of the 33 patients in
the modified PIAF group, 15 had died, 6 had been lost to
follow-up, and 12 were still alive, with a median follow-up
period of 15.3 months (range, 2-98 months). Intent-totreat survival analysis revealed that median overall survival
was significantly longer in the modified PIAF group (21.3
months versus 10.6 months; P 5 .002); the 3-year overall
survival rate was 33.5% in the modified PIAF group versus
10.1% in the conventional PIAF group (Fig. 2A). When
the groups were stratified according to whether patients
underwent curative surgery, patients who underwent curative surgery had better survival regardless of which PIAF
protocol was used (P < .0001) (Fig. 2B). Notably, among
the patients who did not undergo curative surgery, patients
treated with the modified PIAF regimen had better survival
than those treated with the conventional PIAF regimen
(19.0 months versus 10.1 months; P 5 .04). Median time
to progression (TTP) for the 33 patients was 629 days
(95% CI 124 days - not estimated), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 64.4% at 6 months, and
55.2% at 1 year, while median TTP for the 84 patients was
201 days (95% CI 124-333 days), and PFS was 50.4% at 6
months, and 28.2% at 1year.
Multivariate analysis confirmed that ECOG performance status  2 (hazard ratio [HR] 5 1.75; 95%
CI 5 1.04-2.93; P 5 .034) and positive hepatitis B
serology (HR 5 1.68; 95% CI 5 1.08-2.59; P 5 .020)
were associated with worse overall survival, whereas 5 or
more cycles of PIAF therapy (HR 5 0.56; 95%
CI 5 0.33-0.93; P 5 .024), curative surgical resection
(HR 5 0.15; 95% CI 5 0.07-0.35; P < .001), and additional chemotherapy or transarterial chemoembolization
after completion or failure of PIAF regimen (HR 5 0.39;
95% CI 5 0.25-0.61; P < .001) were associated with
better overall survival (Table 4).
The median increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level after initiation of PIAF treatment was
significantly higher in patients with positive than in
patients with negative hepatitis B serology (30 IU/L versus
1 IU/L; P 5 .008), and patients with positive hepatitis B
serology had a higher incidence of hepatic dysfunction
(ALT > 100 IU/L) during PIAF treatment (16 of 33

patients with the contraindication factors showed the lowest objective response rate (13%) (Fig. 3).

patients, 29%, versus 15 of 81 patients, 16%; P 5 .23).

DISCUSSION
In this study, in patients with initially unresectable large
HCC, the modified PIAF regimen in patients with no
cirrhosis or hepatitis B was associated with improved
tolerance, rate of response, resectability, and survival
(Fig. 4). Receipt of 5 or more cycles of PIAF was associated
with higher objective response rate and a rate of conversion
to curative surgery of 33%. Five or more cycles of PIAF
treatment was independently associated with improved survival in multivariate analysis (Table 4) regardless of whether
surgical resection was performed. Taken together, these
observations argue against the notion that HCC is uniformly chemoresistant and lend support for therapeutic
approaches that take into account both HCC and any
underlying liver disease.14 Our approach, if validated,
could lead to establishing a successful neoadjuvant
approach in potentially resectable large HCC tumors.
The emergence of chemotherapy in the 1950s has led
to the availability of neoadjuvant systemic therapies for
patients with advanced solid tumors. However, systemic cytotoxic therapies have demonstrated a very limited impact
on the resectability of advanced HCC despite several studies
showing reasonable response rates.15-18 This is mainly
because advanced underlying liver disease is associated with
poor survival and tolerance of chemotherapy and is a contraindication to surgery in the first place. Recently, molecular
characterization of hepatocarcinogenesis has led to recognition of defined aberrant signaling pathways, which has
facilitated subsequent development of targeted agents as
potential treatments for HCC, either alone or in combination with other therapies. In 2007, sorafenib was approved
for treatment of patients with unresectable HCC based on
possibly improving overall survival. However, sorafenib
showed a very low response rate in randomized phase 3 trials19,20 and failed to downsize tumors to a resectable stage.
In a previous study, Leung et al8 reported that treatment with the PIAF regimen permitted curative surgery
in 18% of patients who had initially unresectable HCC
(Table 2). Although a subsequent phase 3 study by
Yeo et al showed a surgical conversion rate of only 8%
(Table 2),9 the study confirmed an overall objective rate
of 21%, and excellent long-term survival was also confirmed in patients undergoing curative surgery after PIAF
chemotherapy.21 In the current study, the patients treated
with conventional PIAF had an objective response rate of

15% and a rate of conversion to curative surgery of 10%.
However, selected patients with no cirrhosis who were
treated with modified PIAF, similar to that of the phase 2
and 3 studies, had substantially higher rates of objective
response (36%), and conversion to curative surgery
(33%), and also had prolonged survival, even in patients
with ultimately unresectable disease. Furthermore, the
3340

median size of tumor in patients achieving curative
surgery was 10.8 cm, and this was substantially larger than
the reported median size of HCC (4.7-7.0 cm) in
randomized trials of TACE.22,23 These results suggest
that neoadjuvant PIAF systemic therapy can offer a chance
of cure even in selected patients with large HCC who are
not good candidates for TACE.

Modified PIAF Chemotherapy in Unresectable HCC/Kaseb et al

Figure 4. Size reduction of initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma after PIAF (cisplatin/interferon a-2b/doxorubicin/5fluorouracil) therapy. A 61-year-old man with huge hepatocellular carcinoma received 6 cycles of modified PIAF therapy and
eventually was able to undergo curative resection after impressive size reduction of the tumor. At the time of this writing, the
patient is alive with no evidence of disease 74 months after surgery. Computed tomography images are shown (A) before PIAF
therapy, (B) after 6 cycles of PIAF therapy, and (C) after extended left hepatectomy.

Another noteworthy result of this study is that 5 or
more cycles of PIAF appeared to be required for meaningful objective response and optimal survival, regardless of
the PIAF protocol. This result suggests that the PIAF
regimen must be tolerable in order to produce improved
outcomes. The multivariate analysis showed that patients
with chronic liver disease and worse performance status had
worse prognosis. Indeed, these patients had a higher incidence of hepatotoxicity or termination of PIAF treatment
because of toxic effect. With a carefully selected patient
population and dose modification, tolerance of PIAF treatment was clearly improved, which resulted in higher number of cycles of treatment than in our conventional PIAF
cohort or that of previous studies. These findings indicate
that PIAF treatment should be limited to patients with no
chronic liver disease and good performance status.
The limitations of this study include its retrospective
nature and the difficulty of simple comparisons between
the 2 cohorts because they differed with respect to both the
PIAF protocol and patient selection. However, the modified PIAF dosing was based on results from other PIAF
studies and the higher adverse events rate with the conventional PIAF dosing at our center. Furthermore, the current
results are based on prospectively collected data, and the
modified PIAF group showed substantially better outcomes
compared with that of the conventional PIAF groups (Fig.
3) and previous PIAF studies that used very similar chemotherapy protocols with the modified PIAF group (Table
2).8,9 In addition, in the current era of effective anti-hepatitis B virus treatment, negative influence of hepatitis B on
PIAF treatment could be minimized with adequate antiviral therapy. Therefore, further investigation about the effecCancer

September 15, 2013

tiveness of PIAF therapy for patients with anti-hepatitis B
virus treatment is needed. Another limitation is the potential small percentage of patients with no cirrhosis who
would be good candidates for the PIAF regimen. However,
our group and others observed a notable decreasing trend
of the incidence of cirrhosis (55%-60%) and hepatitis
(30%-47%) in HCC in recent years,19,24,25 compared with
the incidence in historic patients whose data were used to
establish the HCC staging systems26-30 (ie, hepatitis 5 82.3%-100% and cirrhosis 5 77%-100%). This is
consistent with and complementary to multiple recent
reports indicating the rising incidence of HCC cases that
are not associated with hepatitis or cirrhosis, specifically
among patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and metabolic syndrome chronic liver diseases which can progress
to HCC without apparent cirrhosis.31-39
In conclusion, in the current era of early goaldirected therapy and a focus on cost-effectiveness, it has
become ever more important that we discriminate
between patients with HCC who are at risk for clinically
relevant adverse outcomes and mortality following specific therapy, such as treatment with the PIAF regimen,
and patients who are at low risk for adverse outcomes,
who stand to benefit most from therapy. Our proposed
personalized therapy approach of neoadjuvant PIAF regimen to patients with no advanced chronic liver disease
preserves the surgical (curative) option to patients who
have a disease considered unresectable at diagnosis.
