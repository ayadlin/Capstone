ABSTRACT:
Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2) plays an essential role in
regulating matrix remodeling, cell growth, differentiation, angiogenesis and apoptosis
in vitro and in vivo. We have recently shown that TIMP-2-mediated inhibition of tumor
growth is independent of matrix metalloproteinase-mediated mechanisms, and is a
consequence of modulating both the tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. In
the current study we aim to identify the molecular pathways associated with these
effects. We analyzed the transcriptional profile of the human lung cancer cell line
A549 upon overexpression of TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 (mutant that does not inhibit
MMP activity), and we found changes in gene expression predominantly related to
decreased tumor development and metastasis. Increased E-cadherin expression in
response to both TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 expression was confirmed by real time
quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. A549 cells treated with epidermal growth
factor (EGF) displayed loss of cobblestone morphology and cell-cell contact, while cells
overexpressing TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2 were resistant to EGF-induced morphological
changes. Moreover, exogenous treatment with recombinant Ala+TIMP-2 blocked
EGF induced down-regulation of E-cadherin. In vivo, immunohistochemistry of
A549 xenografts expressing either TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2 demonstrated increased
E-cadherin protein levels. More importantly, transcriptional profile analysis of tumor
tissue revealed critical pathways associated with effects on tumor-host interaction
and inhibition of tumor growth. In conclusion, we show that TIMP-2 promotes an
anti-tumoral transcriptional profile in vitro and in vivo, including upregulation of
E-cadherin, in A549 lung cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

risk for cancer cell metastasis [1-3]. TIMP-2 is a unique
TIMP family member, in that it both inhibits active
MMP-2 as well as activates pro-MMP-2 in the presence
of a membrane tethered MMP, MMP14/MT1-MMP
[4, 5]. TIMP-2 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of
both angiogenesis and tumor growth, effects that may

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

be dependent or independent of MMP inhibition [612]. Known mechanisms associated with inhibition of
endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro and
angiogenesis in vivo include: a) TIMP-2 binding to integrin
α3β1 receptor and activation of SH2-containing protein
tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), which suppresses the
activity of receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR2 and FGFR1
upon growth factor stimulation (VEGF-A or FGF2); and
b) C-terminus TIMP-2 loop 6 binding to insulin-like
growth factor receptor I (IGF-IR) to disrupt downstream
mitogenic signaling through AKT hypo-phosphorylation
[9, 11, 13]. Major changes within downstream signal
transduction pathways involve induction of cell cycle
arrest with de novo synthesis of tumor suppressor gene
p27kip1, retinoblastoma protein (pRb) hypo-phoshorylation,
and up-regulation of the MMP inhibitor, reversioninducing-cystein-rich protein with Kazal motif (RECK),
via modification of paxillin phosphorylation and Rap1 upregulation [14-18].
More recently, forced expression of TIMP-2 in
A549 human lung cancer cells was performed to address
whether TIMP-2 overexpression directly influences
tumor angiogenesis and/or tumor cell behavior. Indeed,
tumor cell migration and invasion were inhibited in vitro,
whereas in vivo tumor growth inhibition was achieved
through TIMP-2 mediated interaction with the tumor
microenvironment, angiogenesis inhibition and induction
of tumor cell apoptosis [12]. The use of Ala+TIMP-2 in
similar experiments shows that mechanistically, inhibition
of MMP activity does not entirely explain all TIMP-2
functions [19].
Therefore, it is apparent that TIMP-2 plays a broader
role both in endothelial cell physiology and in cancer
development [20]. In an attempt to understand how TIMP2 regulates angiogenesis and tumor growth inhibition,
we performed human cDNA microarray analysis and
compared the differential gene expression profiles of
A549 tumor cells overexpressing TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2
with that of stably transfected Empty Vector control
cells (EV) in vitro and in vivo. We found that the TIMP2 transcriptional signature in A549 cells is associated
with modulation of genes that inhibit endothelial cell
proliferation, angiogenesis, lung cancer development
and metastasis. Specifically, we show that the tumor
suppressor gene E-cadherin is up-regulated by TIMP-2
overexpression in vitro and in vivo, contributing to the
maintenance of cell-cell adhesion that may also contribute
to inhibition of tumor growth.

Differentially expressed gene profiles in TIMP-2
and Ala+TIMP-2 transfected A549 cell lines.
To identify pathways resulting from TIMP-2
mediated effects on tumor cells and the microenvironment,
we performed microarray analysis on TIMP-2 and
Ala+TIMP-2 overexpressing A549 cells, previously
shown to display reduced migration and invasion in
vitro, and tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo [12,
21]. The microarray data can be found at the link: http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=nxm
zxmkaqgisipu&acc=GSE38408. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) of the data (see methods) identifies a subset of
2480 differentially expressed (DE) genes across the three
A549 experimental groups: EV, TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2
(Fig. 1A). Hierarchical clustering of DE genes using
the ‘Pearson centered’ distance similarity method and
‘average’ linkage rule suggests that specific clusters of
enriched gene functions belong exclusively to TIMP-2
(clusters B & F) or Ala+TIMP-2 (clusters D & E) groups,
whereas other clusters (A & C) were common to both
groups (Fig 1A). This analysis reveals several findings:
the TIMP-2/Ala+TIMP-2 commonly expressed genes
(clusters A & C) identify an MMP-independent function
of TIMP-2, whereas genes that change predominantly in
TIMP-2 overexpressing cells (clusters B & F) may a result
of MMP inhibition. Finally, genes affected solely in the
Ala+TIMP-2 group (clusters D & E) may depend on MMP
activation.
Common AC genes in TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2
samples were primarily associated with cellular movement,
death, growth, signaling and metabolism (Supplementary
Fig. 1A). Comprehensive analysis revealed that the
most up- and down-regulated genes, in either TIMP-2 or
Ala+TIMP-2 samples, were related to decreased cancer
development and metastasis (Fig. 1B). More specifically,
the secreted protein EFEMP1 (up-regulated) was recently
shown to suppress malignant glioma growth [22], and
DLC-1 (up-regulated) is a well-known tumor suppressor
gene that regulates cell proliferation and migration [23].
On the other hand, CEACAM6 (down-regulated) is
overexpressed in a number of epithelial malignancies,
particularly in invasive pancreatic cancer [24], and NTS
(down-regulated) is shown to promote cancer cell growth
[25]. In addition, decreased gene function associated with
lung cancer development was shown in both TIMP-2
and Ala+TIMP-2 samples: IGFBP3 and CDH1 were upregulated, and S100P and PTGS2 were down-regulated
[26-30]. These data indicate that TIMP-2 overexpression
transcriptionally regulates tumor cell development and
growth, independent of MMP inhibition, although further
work is needed to identify specific mechanisms. TIMP-2

also exhibited significant changes related to angiogenesis
inhibition and endothelial cell proliferation, including
up-regulation of CAV1, COL1A and SEMA3A, and downregulation of CEACAM1, PTGS2, and FN1 (Fig. 1C)
[31-37]. Taken together, these data suggest that TIMP-2
overexpression in tumor cells could inhibit angiogenesis
through paracrine effects on tumor endothelium, while

decreasing tumor growth directly through regulation of the
tumor cell transcriptome. In addition, since Ala+TIMP-2
overexpression showed similar findings, our data may
partially explain the MMP-independent activity exhibited
by TIMP-2 (illustrated in previous and recent literature [9,
10, 12, 14, 18, 38-41]).

TIMP-2 enhances E-cadherin expression and
inhibits EGF-induced EMT

Exogenous treatment with Ala+TIMP-2 upregulates E-cadherin in A549 cells and a
linear correlation exists between TIMP-2 and
E-cadherin mRNA levels in NSCLC cell lines.

One of the genes identified to be up-regulated in
both TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 profiles is E-cadherin
(CDH1), a gene expressed in most normal epithelial
tissues. However, its loss in several carcinomas leads to
increased tumor invasiveness, angiogenesis and epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [42, 43]. Therefore,
we investigated the role of TIMP-2 in lung cancer
development by analyzing genes associated with cell
adhesion and EMT (Fig. 2A-C). Although some genes
associated with mesenchymal phenotype also showed
altered expression (CDH2, SERPINE1), E-cadherin
was up-regulated in both TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2
overexpressing A549 cells [44]. Since the C-terminus of
E-cadherin binds directly to beta-catenin to stabilize cellcell adhesion, we also examined beta-catenin expression
(Fig. 2B, C) [45]. Indeed, both E-cadherin and betacatenin were increased in TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 cells,
both transcriptionally and at the protein level.
It has been previously demonstrated that treatment
of A549 cells with EGF induces EMT via disruption of
cell-cell adhesion, internalization of E-cadherin from
cell-cell contacts, cellular morphological changes from
cobblestone to spindle shape, and increased cell motility
[46]. Here, treatment of A549 EV cells with EGF
(100ng/ml) for 2.5 hours, 32 hours, 3 days and 5 days
resulted in disruption of cell-cell adhesion and contacts
(spindle shaped, elongated cells), whereas TIMP-2
and Ala+TIMP-2 overexpressing cells were resistant
to chronic EGF treatment (3 and 5 days) (Fig. 2D).
Additionally, previous studies demonstrated that reduced
E-cadherin expression correlates with tumor invasion,
metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer
[28, 47]. Here we show that both E-cadherin and betacatenin are strongly localized at the plasma membrane
and remain so after exposure to EGF in A549 TIMP2 and Ala+TIMP-2, compared to EV cells (Fig. 2E). In
contrast, EV cells treated with EGF showed reduced
levels of both E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression at
the plasma membrane and disrupted cell-cell adhesion.
It was recently shown that TIMP-1 signaling promotes
MDCK cell migration and invasion and induces an EMT
program that also includes FAK activation [48]. TIMP-1,
as opposed to TIMP-2, is overexpressed in a number of
cancers, promoting tumor growth and inhibiting apoptosis,
suggesting that the functional properties of TIMP family
members are distinct. Indeed, we have previously shown
that forced expression of TIMP-2 or Ala+TIMP-2 in A549
cells decreases both AKT and FAK phosphorylation in
tumor xenografts [12].

Since stable transfection may alter cellular
functionality, we addressed whether exogenous treatment
of wild type A549 cells with Ala+TIMP-2 prior to
addition of EGF would affect expression and localization
of E-cadherin and beta-catenin (Fig. 3A). EGF treatment
for 2 hrs decreased the levels of both beta-catenin and
E-cadherin from the plasma membrane. However,
Ala+TIMP-2 pretreatment for 10 min induced upregulation of both E-cadherin and beta-catenin and, more
importantly, prevented EGF induced down-regulation of
E-cadherin and beta-catenin from the plasma membrane.
We then examined whether our findings are specific
for A549 cells or whether other lung cancer cell lines
show a similar pattern. We selected four non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, H23, H460, A549 and
H358M, and we determined the endogenous levels of both
E-cadherin and TIMP-2 by real time PCR (Fig. 3B). Our
results indicate that there is a linear co-relation between
TIMP-2 and E-cadherin mRNA levels in these cells
(p=0.0439, r2 = 0.9141), indicating that the expression of
both molecules may be modulated by similar mechanisms.

A549 xenografts show increased E-cadherin
protein expression and display a transcriptional
profile related to decreased tumor cell growth and
metastasis
TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 A549 xenografts
exhibited reduced tumor growth (70-95% inhibition),
decreased angiogenesis and increased apoptosis in both
nude and NOD-SCID mice (for tumor volumes and
growth see [12, 21]). Immunohistochemical analysis of
tumor tissue revealed increased E-cadherin expression in
TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2 xenografts (Fig. 3C). Previous
data show that membrane loss of E-cadherin leads to
cell-cell separation and promotes the angiogenic switch
in lung cancer [43]. Taken together, our recent findings
of decreased microvascular density in TIMP-2 and
Ala+TIMP-2 xenografts indicate that novel additional
mechanisms may contribute to the anti-angiogenic effects
of TIMP-2 in vivo [12].
To understand the TIMP-2 effects on the tumor
microenvironment and how these have contributed to
the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, we analyzed the
transcriptional profiles of A549 TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2
xenografts at day 21 post inoculation in NOD-SCID
mice (Supplementary Fig 1B) [21]. TIMP-2 xenografts
revealed several specific functions associated with
decreased tumor metastasis and lipid metabolism, while

Ala+TIMP-2 xenografts showed profiles associated with
decreased tumor growth. In an attempt to explain the
tumor growth inhibition in the TIMP-2 and Ala+TIMP-2
xenografts, canonical signaling pathways were analyzed
(Fig. 3D). The most significant pathways, as determined
by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), included insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling, axonal guidance
signaling, integrin linked kinase (ILK) signaling, and
semaphorin signaling in neurons (Fig. 3D). As shown,
the IGF-1 canonical pathway, a network that regulates
cellular proliferation and apoptosis in several cancers and
is implicated in increased lung cancer risk, was negatively
affected by TIMP-2 overexpression (Fig. 3D) [49, 50].
More specifically, when compared to EV tumors, TIMP-2

or Ala+TIMP-2 caused down-regulation of IGF-1 receptor
(IGF-1R) expression (4.8 fold) and an increase in IGF
binding proteins (including IGFBP-5 (4.0 fold) and -7 (3.5
fold)), proteins that limit the bioavailability of IGF ligands
[51]. Given that inhibition of IGF-1R signaling leads to
increased chemosensitivity in A549 cells, manipulation
of the IGF signaling pathway may provide a useful
therapeutic target for cancer therapy [52-55]. TIMP-2 has
also been shown to inhibit IGF-1R directly by binding to
the receptor expressed on endothelial cells [10, 11]. We,
therefore, conclude that TIMP-2 acts on tumor cells and
the tumor microenvironment to inhibit tumor growth.
We, and others, have previously described MMP
dependent and independent anti-angiogenic properties of

Figure 4: Schematic summary of TIMP-2 anti-tumoral and anti-angiogenic functions. TIMP-2 is primarily understood

to both inhibit and activate (via MMP-14/MT1-MMP) MMP-2, which breaks down the ECM, releasing various growth factors (e.g.
VEGFs, TGF-β, IGFs) that promote angiogenesis and cell proliferation [1-5]. The process of angiogenesis further induces the up-regulation
of MMPs and VEGFs, thus, creating a positive feedback that furthers vascular development and cell growth. Independent of MMP
inhibition and activation, TIMP-2 binds to integrin α3β1 receptor, which causes signaling cascades (moderated by SHP-1 and Csk/Src/
PAX/Rap1, respectively) that lead to the hypo-phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and the up-regulation of the anti-migration factor, RECK [12,
20, 41]. Also, previous studies have shown that TIMP-2 binds to endothelial IGF-R1, which causes a net reduction in the phosphorylation
of ERK and AKT, and the subsequent decrease in endothelial growth and angiogenesis [11]. Additional TIMP-2 induced, decreases in
angiogenic function include the up-regulation of semaphorin-3A and the down-regulation of angiopoietin-1 (Fig 1C). Furthermore, TIMP2 is associated with the inhibition of tumor, which has been paired with the observed hypo-phosphorylation of FAK and AKT, proteins
that contribute to the proliferation and growth of tumor cells [12, 13]. Additionally, as presented in this study, TIMP-2 induces the upregulation of E-cadherin, CDH1, which increases cell-cell adhesion, effectively inhibiting tumor cell growth, migration, and epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Finally, additional signs of TIMP-2 induced inhibition of tumor cell growth are the up-regulation of
EFEMP1 and the down-regulation of fibronectin-1 (Fig 1B).

real-time PCR conditions and analysis of gene expression
were given elsewhere [12]. 500 nmol/L forward and
reverse primers for E-cadherin and beta-catenin were
used. Primer sequences for E-cadherin: forward, 5’GGTCAGCGTGTGTGACTGTG -3’ and reverse,
5’- GCAGAATCAGAATTAGCAAAGCAAG -3’ and
Beta-catenin: 5’- GCAGAAAATGGTTGCCTTGCT-3’
and reverse, 5’- GCAGAAAATGGTTGCCTTGCT -3’.
Mean CT values for target genes were normalized for
the endogenous control GAPDH. The ratio of mRNA
expression of target gene versus GAPDH was defined as
2(-ΔCt). All data are shown as mean ± S.E.M. of at least
three independent experiments.

TIMP-2 (Fig. 4). TIMP-2 can inhibit MMP-2 and overall
migration and invasion of tumor endothelium. In addition,
TIMP-2 inhibits blood vessel formation via receptor
mediated mechanisms, including binding to integrin α3β1
on endothelial cells and inactivating receptor tyrosine
kinases including VEGFR-2 and FGFR-2 through dephosphorylation mediated by SHP-1. Additionally, TIMP2 may also bind to IGFR-1 and decrease downstream
signaling. In the current study, we have identified a novel
anti-tumor activity of TIMP-2 – namely an ability to
modify the transcriptional profile of tumor cells, resulting
in increased E-cadherin expression and down-regulation of
IGFR-1 signaling components. Decreased tumorigenesis
and metastasis could be associated with increased
E-cadherin expression in tumor cells, while inhibition of
tumor angiogenesis may involve down-regulation of the
IGFR-1 signaling pathway as well as tumor derived antiangiogenic signals. Our study describes the anti-tumoral
transcriptional signature of TIMP-2 in lung cancer cells.

Western blot analysis
Immunoblotting for TIMP-2 was performed in
conditioned media (CM) as previously described [12].
Cell lysates were collected for analysis of E-cadherin and
beta-catenin protein levels and probed overnight with
mouse anti-E-cadherin antibody, 1/500 dilution (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) and mouse anti-beta-catenin antibody,
1/12,000 (BD Transduction, San Jose, CA).

METHODS
Cell culture and cell culture conditions

Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry

A549 cell culture, retroviral transfection and analysis
were performed and comprehensive characterization and
confirmation of inability of Ala+TIMP-2 to inhibit MMP
has been previously shown [12]. A549 EV, TIMP-2 and
Ala+TIMP-2 were grown to 80% confluency prior to
replacing with fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal calf
serum for 24 hours to induce quiescence. Cells were
treated with or without EGF (100ng/ml) (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) for the indicated times (2.5 hours, 32
hours, 3 days and 5 days) and morphological changes
were observed by phase-contrast microscopy (Olympus
1X70, Center Valley, PA). Exogenous treatment with
Ala+TIMP-2 (100nM) was performed on 24-hours serum
starved cells for 30min. EGF was added at 100ng/ml for
2 hours.

For immunofluorescence studies, A549 cells were
cultured on 4-well glass slides (NUNC, Rochester, NY),
serum starved, and treated with EGF (100ng/ml) for 2.5
or 32 hours. Prior to staining, cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min, permeabilized in
0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and blocked overnight
in 1% BSA at 4oC with two washes in PBS at room
temperature between each of the previous steps. Cells
were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies
to E-Cadherin (Abcam, 1:100) or Beta-catenin (Cell
Signaling, 1:500) overnight at 4oC in a humidity chamber
followed by incubation with goat anti mouse Alexa-488
secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:800) for 1 hour at
room temperature. Both primary and secondary antibodies
were diluted in Antibody Diluent Solution (Dako,
Carpenteria, CA). Representative images were captured
using the Zeiss LSM510 Meta Confocal Microscope. The
E-cadherin expression in resected tumors was determined
by immunohistochemistry as previously described [12].

Cell line, tumor RNA isolation and real time
quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA from three independent exponential
growth phase cell cultures of A549 EV, TIMP-2,
Ala+TIMP-2 and the 4 NSCLC cell lines was isolated
using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD).
Reverse transcription was performed as previously
described [12]. Xenograft tumors were homogenized
using QIAshredder (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and
RNA purified using the RNAeasy kit according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Equal amounts of RNA
(500ng) from six tumors per group were pooled into
one sample and used to perform microarray analysis in

array data were processed using the R/Bioconductor
Statistical Package. MAS 5.0 normalization was
performed on the probes and those with missing values
were filtered. 20729 probes (sd ≥ 0.2) were retained for
further analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) and
unbiased clustering on probe subsets were used to test the
integrity of the arrays (data not shown). The ‘two-class
unpaired’ t-test was performed using Significance of
Microarray (SAM) module on R between samples TIMP2 and EV, or Ala+TIMP-2 and EV individually to derive
differentially expressed genes. ‘Multiclass’ ANOVA was
performed using SAM module to extract significantly
affected probes across all three sample groups. False
Discovery Rate (FDR) cut-off (10%) was used to generate
the lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes.
Single microarray samples (see above, tumor RNA
isolation) derived using xenografts from EV, TIMP-2
and Ala+TIMP-2 tumor cell lines were processed and
normalized using protocol described above. A fold change
analysis was performed between the three sample classes.
DE gene lists from SAM and fold change analyses
were used to extract enriched pathways on Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. An unbiased hierarchical
clustering on the median centered and normalized DE
genes was performed on Cluster version 3.0 and visualized
on Java TreeView version 1.16r2.

The inoculation of A549 EV, TIMP-2 and
Ala+TIMP-2 cells into NOD-SCID mice (n=15 per
group) and growth curves are described elsewhere [12,
21]. The mice were sacrificed 21 days post injection, and
tumors were harvested. Necrotic tissue was removed,
and the tumors were either processed immediately or
stored in RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, NY) for RNA
extraction.
