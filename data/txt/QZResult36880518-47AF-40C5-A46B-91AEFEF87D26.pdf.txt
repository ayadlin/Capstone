BACKGROUND: A previously reported, double-blind, randomized, multicenter phase 3 trial in 205 patients
with stage C/D prostate cancer compared combined androgen blockade (CAB) with luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist (LHRH-A) plus bicalutamide 80 mg versus LHRH-A plus bicalutamide-matching
placebo (LHRH-A monotherapy). The analysis at a median follow-up of 2.4 years indicated that CAB significantly (P < .001) prolonged the time to progression and the time to treatment failure. In the current report,
survival data from a long-term follow-up (median, 5.2 years) were analyzed. METHODS: All deaths irrespective of cause and all prostate cancer-specific deaths were recorded. The data were analyzed using Cox
regression analysis and the log-rank test. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 5.2 years, a significant overall
survival advantage was observed in favor of CAB over LHRH-A monotherapy (Cox regression analysis: hazard
ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.99; P ¼ .0498; log-rank test: P ¼ .0425). The difference in causespecific survival between the 2 groups was not significant. The achievement of a prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) nadir concentration 1 ng/mL was a prognostic factor for improved survival. More patients attained

KEY WORDS: prostate cancer, survival, combined androgen blockade, bicalutamide, luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist, clinical trial, immediate combined androgen blockade, deferred combined
androgen blockade.

Combined androgen blockade (CAB), consisting of
a nonsteroidal antiandrogen plus either a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRH-A) or bilateral
orchiectomy, is a standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Furthermore, early initiation of CAB is a
potential option for patients who are at high risk of prostate cancer-specific death after failing radical treatment
for clinically localized disease.1,2
The use of CAB therapy over castration alone has
been widely debated because of conflicting efficacy data
from individual clinical trials as well as tolerability and
cost issues. In 2000, the Prostate Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (PCTCG) published a large meta-analysis
of all randomized trials initiated before 1991 that compared CAB with castration alone in patients with
advanced prostate cancer (27 studies; n ¼ 8275).3 The
results demonstrated that CAB with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (flutamide or nilutamide) reduced the risk of
death by 8% compared with castration alone (P ¼ .005).
However, the survival benefit was so small that CAB could
not be widely recommended in clinical practice.
Bicalutamide (Casodex; Astra-Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Del), a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with
a better tolerability profile than flutamide and nilutamide,4,5 was not included in the PCTCG meta-analysis,
because no randomized trial data for CAB with bicalutamide versus castration alone were available at the time.
However, Klotz and colleagues6 estimated the efficacy of
CAB with bicalutamide 50 mg using validated statistical
methodology7 to combine PCTCG meta-analysis data
with data from a phase 3 trial of 2 CAB regimens
(LHRH-A plus bicalutamide 50 mg vs LHRH-A plus flutamide). That analysis suggested that CAB with bicalutamide 50 mg could reduce the risk of death by 20%
compared with castration alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.98).
A multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial has
compared CAB directly with bicalutamide 80 mg (the 80
3438

mg dose is licensed for CAB and monotherapy in Japan)
versus castration alone.8,9 In that phase 3 trial, 205 Japanese patients with stage C/D prostate cancer were
randomized to receive either CAB with an LHRH-A plus
bicalutamide 80 mg (n ¼ 102) or LHRH-A monotherapy
(LHRH-A plus bicalutamide-matching placebo; n ¼
103). The proportion of patients who achieved a prostatespecific antigen (PSA) level 4 ng/mL at 12 weeks was
significantly greater for CAB compared with LHRH-A
monotherapy (79.4% vs 38.6%, respectively; P < .001).8
CAB also improved the 12-week overall tumor response
rate versus LHRH-A monotherapy (77.5% vs 65.3%,
respectively; P ¼ .063).8 At a median follow-up of 2.4
years, CAB significantly prolonged the median time to
treatment failure (117.7 weeks vs 60.3 weeks; P < .001)
and time to progression (not reached vs 96.9 weeks; P <
.001), compared with LHRH-A monotherapy.9 It is noteworthy that the incidence of adverse events and withdrawals was similar between the 2 treatment groups.8,9
Results from that trial, along with those from the
analysis by Klotz and colleagues,6 are cited in guidelines
published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology
to support their recommendation that CAB with bicalutamide should be considered for patients with advanced
prostate cancer.10 A subsequent exploratory analysis of the
phase 3 study revealed that, in terms of the median time
to progression, the benefit of CAB versus LHRH-A
monotherapy was greater in patients with stage C disease
(median not reached vs 134.1 weeks; P < .001)9 than in
patients with stage D disease (98.4 weeks vs 64.1 weeks; P
¼ .024) at diagnosis.11 Furthermore, in patients with
stage C disease, CAB significantly prolonged the median
time to progression compared with LHRH-A monotherapy, irrespective of histologic grade, patient age, or PSA
level at diagnosis.11 Those data support the use of CAB
with bicalutamide in patients with locally advanced, metastasis-free prostate cancer.

Survival Data on CAB for Prostate CA/Akaza et al

When the phase 3 study was completed at a median
follow-up of 2.4 years, survival data were immature and,
consequently, no significant differences were observed
between the 2 treatment groups in terms of overall or
cause-specific survival.9 We instigated the Study Group
for the Combined Androgen Blockade Therapy of Prostate Cancer, comprised of the investigators who had participated in the original study, to conduct a long-term
follow-up of patients who were enrolled in the original
study and remained alive after the trial was completed.
The current article presents the results of the survival analysis from the long-term follow-up study.

because of adverse drug reactions. Secondary endpoints
included time to treatment failure, time to progression, survival, quality of life (QoL), time to PSA normalization, and
the incidence of adverse events and adverse drug reactions.
After the original phase 3 study, the Study Group
for the Combined Androgen Blockade Therapy of Prostate Cancer conducted a follow-up study of patients who
were enrolled in the original study and were still alive
when the original study was completed (from December
2003). The institutional review board at each medical
center approved the follow-up study, and all patients provided written informed consent.
Assessments and Statistical Analyses

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
Detailed methods for the original phase 3 study were published previously8,9 and are briefly summarized here.
Patients with histologically confirmed, previously untreated,
advanced (stage C/D12) prostate cancer were recruited at 49
centers in Japan between February 2000 and December
2001. All patients received an LHRH-A according to the
investigator’s choice, either goserelin acetate (Zoladex;
Astra-Zeneca Pharmaceuticals) 3.6 mg or leuprorelin acetate
(Leuprin; Takeda Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) 3.75
mg, given as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. In
addition, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
either oral bicalutamide 80 mg or matching placebo once
daily. Randomized treatment was given in a double-blind
manner until September 2002, when the code was broken
for ethical reasons. Subsequently, patients in the LHRH-A
monotherapy group discontinued placebo, and patients in
the CAB group continued their treatment in an open-label
manner. Patients continued to receive randomized treatment until the end of November 2003 or until there was
evidence of disease progression or any other event leading to
withdrawal. Patients who had disease progression during
LHRH-A monotherapy were treated at the investigator’s
discretion, with the option of adding bicalutamide 80 mg
(deferred CAB). For patients who experienced disease progression in the CAB group, bicalutamide was discontinued,
and the patient was monitored for antiandrogen withdrawal
syndrome at the investigator’s discretion. The primary endpoints were PSA normalization rate and overall tumor
response at 12 weeks and the percentage of withdrawals

All deaths, irrespective of cause, and all prostate cancer-specific deaths were recorded for 3 years from the completion
of the original study (the follow-up period ended in March
2007). Confirmed deaths from the original study plus
deaths that were recorded during the follow-up period were
analyzed at the University of Tsukuba. Overall survival and
cause-specific survival were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model with covariates for randomized treatment, clinical stage, age, performance status, PSA
level at diagnosis, histologic grade, and the type of LHRHA received. An additional Cox regression analysis of overall
survival was performed with covariates for the PSA nadir
level achieved during the original study irrespective of
whether randomized treatment had been discontinued (1
ng/mL or >1 ng/mL), randomized treatment, clinical stage,
age, performance status, histologic grade, and the type of
LHRH-A received. Results from the Cox regression analyses
were confirmed using the log-rank test.
For patients who achieved a PSA nadir of 1 ng/mL
during the original study, the time taken to reach the nadir level was assessed. The number of patients achieving
PSA nadir levels >4 ng/mL, from 4 to >1 ng/mL, from
1 to >0.2 ng/mL, and 0.2 ng/mL during the administration of randomized treatment only also was
investigated.

patients in the LHRH-A monotherapy group withdrew
from the study before commencing treatment (because of
deterioration of performance status and failure to attend a
hospital visit, respectively). The demographics and baseline characteristics of the patients who received randomized treatment were similar between the 2 treatment arms
and are summarized in Table 1.9 For the majority of men
in both treatment arms, the choice of LHRH-A was goserelin acetate (75.5% and 78.2% for the CAB and LHRHA arms, respectively).

Overall Survival
At a median follow-up of 5.2 years, there were fewer overall deaths with CAB than with LHRH-A monotherapy
(26 deaths vs 38 deaths, respectively). A significant overall
survival advantage was observed in favor of CAB over
LHRH-A monotherapy (Cox regression analysis: HR,
0.78; 95% CI, 0.60-0.99; P ¼ .0498; log-rank test: P ¼

of patients who achieved a PSA nadir 1 ng/mL had
reached that level within the first 192 days of the study
(Fig. 6). During randomized treatment, PSA nadir concentrations 1 ng/mL were achieved by 83 of 102

DISCUSSION
In this report, long-term follow-up data from a phase 3
study of CAB with bicalutamide 80 mg versus LHRH-A
monotherapy alone have demonstrated a significant overall survival advantage in favor of CAB. The overall survival advantage for CAB is consistent with previous
observations from this study of prolonged time to treatment failure and time to progression.9 In particular, the

CAB with bicalutamide 80 mg (22%) concurs with that
estimated by Klotz and colleagues6 for CAB with bicalutamide 50 mg (20%). In most countries, bicalutamide is licensed at a dose of 50 mg daily for use in CAB. However,
based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data,13
the only approved dose of bicalutamide in Japanese men
is 80 mg per day for monotherapy. A previous pilot study
of LHRH-A in combination with bicalutamide 80 mg
identified no safety concerns14; therefore, the 80 mg dose
of bicalutamide is used both for monotherapy and for
CAB in Japan. A comparison between our study results
and Western CAB data with bicalutamide 50 mg should
be considered as the next step.
In total, 30 patients in the CAB group experienced
disease progression during the original phase 3 study,
including at least 18 patients who were observed for antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome, and 7 patients (39%)
responded (median response duration, 58 weeks).9 Of 57

patients in the LHRH-A monotherapy group who had
disease progression during the phase 3 study, at least 40
patients subsequently received second-line CAB with
bicalutamide 80 mg, and 31 patients (78%) responded to
that treatment (median response duration, 40 weeks).9
Currently, CAB is used widely in Japan and accounts for
approximately 70% of primary hormone therapy for prostate cancer.15 For patients who receive LHRH-A monotherapy as initial treatment and subsequently experience
Cancer

disease progression, second-line therapy is usually the
addition of an antiandrogen to their regimen (deferred
CAB therapy). Because the majority of patients who progressed in the LHRH-A monotherapy group received second-line CAB therapy, our study can be considered a
comparison of immediate versus deferred CAB. Consequently, results from the current follow-up study suggest
that immediate CAB may be superior to deferred CAB in
terms of prolonging overall survival.
Although it was not predefined in the protocol, a
subgroup analysis of overall survival by clinical stage was
performed for reference. Consequently, the difference in
overall survival between CAB and LHRH-A monotherapy
was greater in the patients who had stage C/D1 disease. In
the original phase 3 study, the same tendency was
observed in the time to progression for CAB in the
patients who had stage C disease, suggesting that the longterm prognosis for patients who have stage C disease and
3443

Original Article

are treated with CAB can be expected to be markedly
better than that of the patients who are treated with
LHRH-A monotherapy.9 Sylvester et al. reported that,
among patients with stage D2 prostate cancer who either
underwent orchiectomy or received CAB (goserelin þ flutamide), the survival benefit of CAB was greater for
patients who had mild bone metastasis than for those who
had more advanced disease.16 On the basis of these results,
the survival benefit of CAB versus LHRH-A monotherapy
is expected to be much greater for patients who have early
stage disease.
Our follow-up study revealed no significant difference in cause-specific survival between CAB and LHRHA monotherapy (P ¼ .0918). This is unsurprising,
because the analysis lacked statistical power to detect a significant difference in cause-specific mortality in light of
the low number of prostate cancer-related deaths (14
patients on CAB and 22 on LHRH-A monotherapy). To
observe a treatment difference in cause-specific survival,
longer follow-up or a larger patient population may be
necessary.
Previous studies have suggested that the normalization of PSA by hormone therapy may be associated with
prolonged time to progression and survival.17,18 Because
of an exploratory multivariate analysis with PSA cutoff
levels of 4 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL, and 0.2
ng/mL, the use of 1 ng/mL produced a stable and better
fitting model with a small P value and variance of estimated values. Therefore, we used a cutoff level of 1 ng/
mL for our analysis of overall survival. Data from our
study indicated that patients who attained a PSA nadir
1 ng/mL survived significantly longer than patients who
had PSA levels that remained >1 ng/mL. It also was apparent that patients who received CAB achieved lower PSA
nadir levels than patients who received LHRH-A monotherapy. It is noteworthy that PSA levels fell below 0.2 ng/
mL (the detection limit) in 89% of patients who had a
PSA nadir 1 ng/mL in the CAB group, compared with
only 41% of patients who had a PSA nadir 1 ng/mL in
the LHRH-A monotherapy group. Therefore, the PSA
reduction associated with CAB appears to be important
clinically in terms of prolonging overall survival. Among
the patients who achieved a PSA nadir 1 ng/mL in the
original study, 75% had attained this nadir within
approximately 6 months (192 days). This suggests that, if
no therapeutic effect is observed within the first 6 months
3444

of treatment, then a change of therapy should be
considered.
A primary obstacle to the wider use of CAB is the
potential for increased side effects and costs compared
with castration alone. Indeed, compared with castration
alone, CAB with flutamide is associated with an increased
incidence of gastrointestinal disorders and hepatotoxicity,
whereas CAB using nilutamide is associated with an
increased incidence of visual disorders.19 However, in the
phase 3 study of CAB with bicalutamide 80 mg versus
LHRH-A monotherapy, there was no difference between
the 2 treatment arms regarding the percentage of withdrawals because of adverse drug reactions (primary safety
endpoint) or adverse drug reaction profiles.8,9 QoL was
assessed as a secondary endpoint in this study using the
Japanese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy-Prostate questionnaire.20 These data demonstrated that, compared with LHRH-A monotherapy,
CAB with bicalutamide did not reduce overall QoL and
provided an early improvement in QoL related to micturition disorder and pain.21
Nishimura and colleagues22 conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of CAB with bicalutamide 80 mg based
on efficacy data from the phase 3 study and medical costs
in Japan. Those authors concluded that CAB was a costefficient therapy with an incremental cost effectiveness
ratio of approximately ¥1,560,000 (approximately
$14,000 in US dollars). This is consistent with results
from similar analyses conducted in the United States. For
example, Ramsey and colleagues23 demonstrated that the
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)
gained for CAB with bicalutamide 50 mg versus CAB
with flutamide was $22,000 at 5 years and $16,000 at 10
years. Likewise, Penson and colleagues24 estimated that
the cost per QALY of CAB with bicalutamide 50 mg was
$33,677 and $20,053 at 5 years and 10 years, respectively,
compared with castration alone. These studies support
CAB with bicalutamide as a cost-effective treatment strategy for patients with advanced prostate cancer.
In conclusion, the long-term follow-up of the first
double-blind controlled study to directly compare CAB
with bicalutamide 80 mg versus LHRH-A monotherapy
has demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival
benefit in favor of CAB. The advantage in overall survival,
together with the previously reported significant improvements in time to treatment failure and time to

progression, which were achieved without reducing tolerability, indicate that CAB with bicalutamide is a recommendable first-line therapy option for patients with
locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.
