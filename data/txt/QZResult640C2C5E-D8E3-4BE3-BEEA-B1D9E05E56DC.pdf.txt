ABSTRACT
The major oncogenic driver of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is the fusion
protein PML-RARα originated from the chromosomal translocation t(15;17). All-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide cure most patients by directly targeting PMLRARa. However, major issues including the resistance of ATRA and arsenic therapy
still remain in APL clinical management. Here we showed that compound Z-10, a
nitro-ligand of retinoid X receptor a (RXRα), strongly promoted the cAMP-independent
apoptosis of both ATRA- sensitive and resistant NB4 cells via the induction of caspasemediated PML-RARa degradation. RXRa was vital for the stability of both PML-RARa
and RARa likely through the interactions. The binding of Z-10 to RXRα dramatically
inhibited the interaction of RXRa with PML-RARa but not with RARα, leading to
Z-10’s selective induction of PML-RARα but not RARa degradation. Z-36 and Z-38,
two derivatives of Z-10, had improved potency of inducing PML-RARα reduction and
NB4 cell apoptosis. Hence, RXRα ligand Z-10 and its derivatives could target both
ATRA- sensitive and resistant APL cells through their distinct acting mechanism, and
are potential drug leads for APL treatment.

All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces the
transcriptional activity of PML-RARα, leading to the
induction of RARα-targeted genes and the differentiation
of promyelocyte [2]. ATRA also triggers proteasomeand caspase-mediated degradation of PML-RARα
to contribute its efficacy [8–10]. However, ATRA at
pharmacological concentration strongly stimulates the
transactivation and degradation of RAR, resulting in
some RAR-related adverse effects [11, 12]. Also, long
term exposure of ATRA often results in the relapse likely
due to the mutated RARα moiety in PML-RARα [13,
14]. Arsenic trioxide binds to the PML moiety, leading
to SUMO-dependent and ubiquitin-mediated degradation
of PML-RARα [15, 16]. The reduction of PML-RARα
sensitizes APL cells to the apoptotic signals triggered by
arsenic [17]. Because arsenic targets to the PML moiety,
it can overcome ATRA-resistance in some cases [13].

INTRODUCTION
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) originates
from the specific chromosomal translocations mostly
between chromosomes 15 and 17, leading to the
occurrence of the fused oncogene promyelocytic
leukemia - retinoic acid receptor-α (PML-RARα) [1].
The corresponding chimeric protein PML-RARα is most
often the only driving factor of APL initiation [2, 3]. PMLRARα binds to RARα cognate DNA elements and inhibits
RARα-mediated transcription of differentiation genes,
leading to the differentiation block of promyelocytes [2,
4]. PML is the organizer of a nuclear structure known
as the PML nuclear bodies (NBs), which is important
for maintaining cellular homeostasis [5, 6]. Another
pathogenic activity of PML-RARα is to disrupt the PML
nuclear bodies through its interaction with PML [7].

However, APL driven by the PLZF-RARα and PMLRARα with point mutations in the PML moiety such as
A216V are resistant to arsenic [18, 19]. Thus, novel drugs
with different therapeutic mechanisms are desperately
needed to overcome the resistance and adverse effects of
ATRA and/or arsenic.
Retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) is a unique nuclear
receptor due to its ability to form heterodimers with many
other nuclear receptors [20]. It has been elucidated that
PML-RARα forms homodimer mediated by the PML
moiety, and RXRα binds to PML-RARα through the
RARα moiety to form heterotetramer [21]. RXRα is
required for the sumoylation of PML-RARα and PML
RARα efficient binding to DNA, both of which are
necessary for PML-RARα-mediated transformation [22–
25]. Several RXRα ligands such as SR11237 and BMS749
trigger the differentiation and apoptosis of APL cells, but
they have to work together with cAMP for efficient action
[26, 27], leading to the additional side effects from cAMP.
Thus, whether some RXRα ligands alone could show
striking anti-APL effect is worthy of investigation.
We recently reported that Z-10, a nitro-ligand of
RXRα, binds to RXRα with a distinct binding mode and
induces a unique conformational change of RXRα [28].
In the current study, we report that Z-10 induced PMLRARα degradation and the apoptosis of both ATRAsensitive and resistant APL cells in a cAMP-independent
manner.

cell apoptosis comparing with ATRA (8.07%, 7.38% and
4.76% NB4 cells underwent apoptosis in the presence of
Z-10, arsenic, and ATRA, respectively) (Figure 1C). In
addition, the apoptotic induction of Z-10 was in a dosedependent manner (Figure 1C). These results suggested
that Z-10 was of potent capability on inducing NB4 cell
apoptosis.

Z-10 destabilizes PML-RARα
Through the induction of PML-RARα degradation,
arsenic promotes the apoptosis of APL cells [17]. Thus,
we explored whether Z-10 affected the stability of PMLRARα. Figure 2A and 2B showed that Z-10 time- and
dose- dependently induced PML-RARα reduction in
the absence of cAMP. In the presence of cycloheximide
(CHX), Z-10 still induced PML-RARα reduction in a timedependent manner, indicating that Z-10 destabilized PMLRARα protein (Figure 2C). The small fragments of PMLRARα induced by Z-10 suggested that Z-10 destabilized
PML-RARα through cleavage (Figure 2A-2C). Z-10induced PML-RARα reduction and cleavage were strongly
inhibited by z-VAD-FMK but only slightly prevented by
MG132, implying that caspases but not proteasome was
mainly responsible for the degradation and cleavage of
PML-RARα (Figure 2D). Z-11 (Figure 1A), an isomer of
Z-10, also binds to RXRα but induces a distinct RXRα
conformation [28]. Different from Z-10, Z-11 failed to
trigger PML-RARα reduction (Figure 2E), indicating
the selectivity of RXRα nitro-ligands. Additionally, the
strong ability of Z-10 on inducing PML-RARα reduction
was unique among RXRα ligands examined (Figure 2F).
Therefore, results from above study showed that Z-10
down-regulated PML-RARα mainly through caspasemediated cleavage in a cAMP independent manner, which
might trigger the apoptosis of NB4 cells. This may also
explain why Z-10 induced dramatic apoptosis in NB4 cells
but not in THP1 cells that do not possess PML-RARα
oncoprotein (Supplementary Figure 2).

RESULTS
Z-10 induces NB4 cell apoptosis
RXRα ligands together with cAMP have shown
striking anti-APL activities [26, 27]. Recently, we
unraveled that Z-10 is a RXRα nitro-ligand with strong
growth inhibition and apoptotic induction of MCF-7 breast
cancer cells [28]. We therefore explored the activities of
Z-10 on the differentiation and apoptosis induction of NB4
cells, a human APL cell line with PML-RARα oncogene
[29] (Figure 1). Differentiation induction of Z-10 on NB4
cells was examined by flow cytometry following CD11b
the surface differentiation marker staining. As previously
reported, ATRA at 1 μM concentration significantly
triggered NB4 cell differentiation, as shown by the
increased CD11b staining (0.65% CD11b positive cells at
DMSO treatment to 30.35% at ATRA treatment) (Figure
1B and Supplementary Figure 1). In comparison, Z-10 at
1 and 2 μM concentrations only had, if there was, minor
effect (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 3). Z-10 at
3 μM and arsenic at 1 μM had much weaker effect than
ATRA at 1 μM on differentiation induction of NB4 cells
(Figure 1B and 5A and Supplementary Figure 1 and 3).
The apoptotic effect of Z-10 on NB4 cells was examined
through Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay. Both
Z-10 and arsenic at 1 μM significantly promoted NB4

Z-10 inhibits the interaction of PML-RARα and
RXRα
We evaluated whether Z-10 activated caspases
to cleave PML-RARα. Caspase activator PAC-1 could
induce PML-RARα degradation only when caspase3
was highly activated, showing from the simultaneous
events of PML-RARα decreased and cleaved caspase3
increased expressions. However, PML-RARα degradation
induced by Z-10 was an earlier event before the weak
activation of caspase3 (Figure 3A). This suggested that
Z-10-induced PML-RARα degradation may not, at
least not completely, depend on caspase activation. The
binding of RXRα to PML-RARα has been implicated
in the development of APL [2]. We then examined the
possibility of RXRα regulating PML-RARα stability.

When NB4 cells were transfected with siRNA to reduce
RXRα expression, the expression levels of both PMLRARα and RARα were accordingly reduced (Figure 3B),
suggesting that RXRα binding stabilizes PML-RARα and
RARα. We hypothesized that Z-10 could bind to RXRα
and inhibit the interaction of RXRα and PML-RARα,

thereby leading to the instability of PML-RARα. Our
co immunoprecipitation assay showed that PML-RARα
and RXRα overexpressed in Cos-7 cells formed strong
complex, which was largely disrupted by Z-10 (Figure 3C3D and 4C). It has been reported that Z-10 fails to bind
to RXRα/C432S mutant with cysteine 432 substituted

with serine [28]. We found that Z-10 also failed to inhibit
the interaction of PML-RARα and RXRα/C432S (Figure
3D), which indicated that Z-10 inhibiting RXRα and PML/
RARα interaction relied on its binding to RXRα. In Cos7 cells, overexpressed RXRα prevented Z-10 induced
PML-RARα degradation to a certain extent (Figure 3E).
Therefore, RXRα binding could stabilize PML-RARα, and
the disruption of the RXRα/PML RARα complex by Z-10
resulted in the instability of PML-RARα. Our data also
suggested that the basal activity of caspases was able to
induce PML-RARα cleavage once the PML-RARα/RXRα
complex was disrupted by Z-10.

originates from its strong induction of RARα activation
and degradation when patients are treated with ATRA
at pharmacologic concentrations [30, 31]. Consistently,
we found that ATRA at 1 μM potently induced RARα
degradation in NB4 cells (Figure 4A). However, Z-10 only
induced PML-RARα degradation and had no apparent
effect on the expression level of RARα in NB4 cells
(Figure 4A). Similarly, Z-10 dramatically promoted the
degradation of overexpressed PML-RARα but not RARα
in Cos-7 cells (Figure 4B). As expected, Z-10 failed to
inhibit the interaction of RARα and RXRα as did to the
interaction of PML RARα and RXRα (Figure 4C). Thus,
Z-10 induction of PML-RARα but not RARα degradation
was due to its selective inhibition of RXRα interaction
with PML-RARα but not with RARα.

Z-10 has no effect on RARα stability
Because ATRA could bind to both PML-RARα
and RARα, one unavoidable side effect of ATRA

only in NB4 cells but not in NB4-LR1 or NB4-LR2 cells
(Figure 5B and 5D). However, Z-10 was able to induce
PML-RARα degradation in all the three cell lines (Figure
5B-5E). Also, Z-10 dose- and time-dependently induced
PML-RARα reduction and cleavage in both NB4-LR1
and NB4-LR2 cell lines mainly through caspase-mediated
pathway (Figure 5C-5F). Similarly, Z-10 did not affect
the expression of RARα in NB4-LR1 cells (Figure 5D).

ATRA is a widely used and effective clinical drug
for APL [32, 33]. However, a fraction of APL is refractory
to ATRA due to long-term ATRA treatment and PMLRARα mutations [13, 14]. As previously reported, ATRA
could strongly induce the differentiation of NB4 cells but
not NB4-LR1 and NB4-LR2 cells, two ATRA-resistant
cell lines [14, 34] (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure
3). Consistently, ATRA promoted PML-RARα degradation

was not directly correlated to their activation of RXRα
transactivation.

DISCUSSION

Z-36 and Z-38 are optimized Z-10 derivatives

Although ATRA and arsenic have improved the
overall survival rate of APL patients [35, 36], there
exist major issues in the APL treatment such as ATRA
and arsenic resistance as well as their off target side
effects [18, 19, 37]. In our current study, we provided a
potential drug lead that may overcome ATRA-resistance
and ATRA-related side effects through its distinct acting
mode.
Z-10, as the first identified nitro-ligand of RXRα,
has distinct properties from classic RXRα ligands in both
molecular structures and RXRα-dependent activities [28].
cAMP-dependent and PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation
of PML-RARα is crucial for some RXRα ligands to
efficiently induce PML-RARα degradation and APL cell
apoptosis [38, 39]. Here, we showed that Z-10 is unique
among RXRα ligands in that it has strong anti-APL

To improve the potency of Z-10, we synthesized
a series of Z-10 derivatives and examined their effects
in NB4 cells. Among the synthesized Z-10 derivatives
examined, we found that Z-37 had similar ability as
Z-10 while Z-36 and Z-38 possessed stronger ability
than Z-10 on inducing PML-RARα degradation (Figure
1A and Figure 6B). In consistent with their ability on
degrading PML-RARα, Z-36 and Z-38 showed stronger
potency on inhibiting NB4 cell viability (The IC50 of
Z-10, Z-36 and Z-38 were 4.284, 0.7476 and 0.713 μM,
respectively). Z-36 and Z-38 also displayed stronger
apoptosis induction of NB4 and NB4-LR1 cells than
Z-10 (Figure 6D). Z-10 and its derivatives exhibited
similar stimulating effect of RXRα transactivation
(Figure 6A), suggesting that their anti-APL ability

activity in the absence of cAMP (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
This should, at least in part, be attributed to its induction of
a distinct RXRα conformation, resulting in the dissociation
of PML-RARα from RXRα (Figure 3C-3D and Figure
4C). The cAMP-independent PML-RARα degradation by
Z-10 also suggested that Z-10 may represent a promising

drug lead in a distinct class of RXRα ligands for APL
treatment.
RXRα forms strong heterotetramers with PMLRARα, and disruption of their interaction inhibits APL
initiation and development [24, 25]. RXRα has been
shown to be required for PML-RARα sumoylation and
efficiently binding to DNA, both of which are essential

events for APL transformation [22, 23]. In our research,
we unraveled that RXRα was also vital for the stability of
PML-RARα (Figure 3), which provided a new mechanism
underlying RXRα actions in APL. It is conceivable
that this contribution of RXRα also originates from
its interaction with PML-RARα. Therefore, a feasible
approach to eliminate PML-RARα is to abrogate its
interaction with RXRα. Indeed, Z-10 could potently
inhibit the interaction of PML-RARα and RXRα (Figure

3C-3D and Figure 4C), leading to the caspase-mediated
cleavage of PML-RARα (Figure 2D). We hypothesized
that the binding of RXRα may preclude the cleavage of
PML-RARα through masking the cleavage sites or
inhibiting the access of caspases. Figure 3A indicated that
PML-RARα reduction induced by Z-10 preceded caspase
activation, implying that basal activity of caspases was
enough for catalyzing PML-RARα cleavage once the
PML-RARα/RXRα complex was disrupted.

hours, and cell proliferation was measured by MTS assay. Data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism software. D. NB4 and

Different from the heterodimer formed by RARα
and RXRα, PML-RARα and RXRα forms heterotetramer.
In the heterotetramer, PML-RARα not only interacts with
RXRα through RARα moiety, but also interacts with each
other through PML moiety [23, 25]. These may underlie
the different modes of RXRα interaction with PML-RARα
and RARα. It is conceivable that the conformational
change induced by Z-10 may only affect RXRα interaction
with PML-RARα but not with RARα, a possibility that
was confirmed by our co immunoprecipitation assay
(Figure 4C). Consistently, even though RXRα was vital
for the stability of both PML-RARα and RARα, Z-10
binding to RXRα selectively reduced the stability of PMLRARα (Figure 4A-4B and Figure 5D). This property might
allow Z-10 to circumvent some of ATRA's side effects.
RXRα could form heterodimers with many other nuclear
receptors [40]. If Z-10 did not affect RXRα binding to
RARα, it likely has no or only minor effect on RXRα
heterodimerization with other nuclear receptors.
One limitation in APL treatment is ATRA resistance
[14, 41]. Due to the mutations of the RARα moiety that
directly affect the binding of ATRA, it should be difficult
to solve this issue through modifying ATRA or using
other RARα ligands. Since Z-10 inhibited PML RARα
through binding to RXRα, it may overcome this problem.
Indeed, our results showed that Z-10 induced PML-RARα
degradation and apoptosis in ATRA-resistant NB4 cells
(Figure 5). This implied that RXRα was also important
to maintain the stability of the mutated PML RARα, and
Z-10 was able to inhibit the interactions of RXRα with
the mutated PML-RARα. It remains to be investigated
whether Z-10 could also overcome the arsenic-resistance.
Z-36 and Z-38 are two derivatives of Z-10 only after
simple modifications (Figure 1A). However, these two
derivatives had substantially improved potency (Figure 6B6D), which suggested that Z-10 can be further optimized
in term of APL treatment. Animal studies of Z-10 and its
derivatives will be needed to confirm their efficacy and
study their potential side effects. It will also be interesting
to study the synergistic effect of Z-10 and ATRA in animal
experiments.

Apoptosis and differentiation assay

The authors declare no competing financial interests.

Three-milliliter cultures of NB4, NB4-LR1 and
NB4-LR2 cells at a density of 3×105 cells/mL were
incubated with compounds and equal amount of DMSO
for 36 hours. The apoptosis of the cells was detected using
FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (556547,
BD Biosciences) according to the instructions of the
manufacturer. Cell surface differentiation antigen CD11b
was measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled
antibodies with isotype controls via flow cytometry.

NB4 cells were seeded in 96-well culture
plate at a cell density of 1×105 cells/mL and treated
with compounds for 36 hours. The cell viability was
evaluated using an MTS assay kit (Promega, G3580).
Briefly, MTS (10 mg/ml, 3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2
(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium) was added to each well followed by
incubation for 2 hours at 37 °C. The absorbance was
measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using an ElisaReader.

293T cells were cotransfected with pG5-luc reporter
(Promega) together with the RXRα-LBD fused with the
DNA-binding domain of Gal4. After 24 hours, cells were
treated with DMSO, Z compounds, or 9-cis- RA. After
12 hours, cells were lysed by passive lysis buffer. Firefly
and Renilla luciferase activities were quantitated using
the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega,
E1960). Transfection and expression efficiency was
normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.
