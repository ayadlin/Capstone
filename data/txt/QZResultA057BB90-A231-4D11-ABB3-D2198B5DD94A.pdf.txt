ABSTRACT
PURPOSE: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have limited
effective therapeutic options. Given the rapid advanced in drug development and
emergence of novel agents, we analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of HCC
patients treated on early phase trials with an emphasis on targeted therapies.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of consecutive HCC patients evaluated in
the Phase I Clinical Trials Program at MD Anderson from March 2004.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were not treated due to poor performance status
(n = 22, 56%) and decision to pursue alternate therapies (n = 10, 27%). Of 61
treated patients (median age, 60 years; median prior therapies, 3), eight patients
(13%) attained stable disease lasting ≥6 months; four (7%) had a partial response,
mainly with anti-angiogenic or multikinase inhibitors. Median Phase I progressionfree survival (PFS) was 2.6 months versus 4.4 months (p 0.019) and 4.1 months
(p 0.27) for their first-, and second-line FDA-approved therapy. Molecular analysis
showed frequent PTEN loss (10/19 patients, 53%) and P53 mutation (4/4 patients
tested). On multivariate analysis, independent factors predicting shorter survival were
white ethnicity/race (p 0.031), cirrhosis (p 0.016), and serum sodium (p 0.0013).
CONCLUSIONS: In our heavily-pretreated HCC patients, the phase I PFS was
comparable to that of 2nd-line therapy, highlighting a potential role for clinical trials
after progression on first-line therapy. The response rate (SD>6 months/PR) of
20% was observed with early signals of activity in regimens combining inhibitors
of angiogenesis, multiple kinases and mTOR with preliminary molecular analysis
revealing prevalence of PTEN loss.

both of which remain the only potentially curative options.

trial in 602 patients with advanced HCC demonstrates
an improvement in the median overall survival (10.7
months) in the sorafenib group versus the placebo group
(7.9 months).[6] Multimodal therapeutic approaches
using arterial embolization or chemoembolization also
demonstrate a survival benefit over supportive care
alone in patients with unresectable disease.[7, 8] Recent
advancements incorporated the use of radioembolization
with yttrium-90 into the treatment algorithm for
intermediate to advanced HCC with Child-Pugh class A
or B.[9-11] With the expanding development of agents
targeting angiogenesis and aberrant cell signaling, we
explored the characteristics and outcomes of patients
with advanced HCC who received treatment on a phase I
clinical trial with an emphasis on targeted therapies.

in a phase I clinical trial due to poor performance status
(ECOG >3, N = 22, 56%), decision to pursue alternate
therapies including treatments closer to home (N = 10,
26%), no evidence of disease post-resection (N = 3),
prohibitive lab abnormalities (N = 2) and insurance denial
(N = 2).
Overall, 61 patients who participated in a phase I
trial are included henceforth in this analysis. Pretreatment
characteristics at presentation to the Phase I clinic are
summarized in Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was
60 years (range, 11-84 years). There were 12 women and
49 men of whom 30 (49%) were White, 11 (18%) Asian,
10 (16%) African American, and 10 (16%) of Hispanic
origin. Eleven patients (18%) had an ECOG PS of 0, 49
patients (80%) had a PS of 1 and 1 (2%) patient a 2. The
median number of metastatic sites was 2 (range 0-5).
The most common sites of metastases at time of Phase I
referral were liver (N = 49, 80% of patients), lymph nodes
(N = 31, 51%), lung (N = 25, 41%), peritoneum (N = 14,
23%), bone (N = 13, 21%), adrenal (N = 8, 13%), and
other (ovary, pancreas, spleen; N = 3, 5%). Regarding the
extent of liver disease, 41 patients (37%) were classified
as modified Child-Pugh class A while the remaining 20
(33%) had Class B disease.

proceeded with a phase I clinical trial.

Treatment

Overall, of the 61 patients enrolled on a phase I trial,
four patients had received no prior therapy because of the
unavailability of reasonable, conventional therapy for the
extent of their disease or patient desire to pursue clinical
trial. The remaining 57 patients had a median of 3 prior
systemic therapies before referral to the phase I clinic
(range, 1 – 8). Twenty six patients (43%) also underwent
a prior chemoembolization, 17 (28%) a surgical resection,
12 (20%) yttrium-90 radioembolization, 12 (20%)
radiation, 8 (12%) a radiofrequency ablation, and 3 (5%)
an orthotopic liver transplantation.
For their first-line treatment in the advanced/
metastatic setting, 41 of 61 patients received a sorafenibbased regimen, of whom 39 received single-agent
sorafenib while 2 received sorafenib in combination
with erlotinib. Three patients received erlotinib
plus bevacizumab; 5 received a capecitabine-based
regimen, 4 received a gemcitabine-based regimen, 3
received platinum combination therapy, and 1 received
experimental therapy on phase II trial with a novel
camptothecin analog. 33 patients did not receive a second
line treatment with FDA-approved agents and instead

received therapy on 11 “first-in-human” trials with novel
targeted inhibitors against VEGFR, kit, cMET, EGFR,
HER2, CHK1, RAS, organic arsenic or an oleander extract
derivative.
Of 61 patients, 39 (64%) were treated on a trial
with combination therapy of two or more agents while
22 patients (36%) received treatment with a single agent.

thereby attaining a partial response.

Response

The median time from diagnosis of advanced/
metastatic disease to date of primary evaluate in the phase
I clinic was 9.6 months for the 61 patients who enrolled on
a phase I trials. The median time from the primary phase I
consultation to beginning therapy on a phase I clinical trial
was 19 days. The median overall survival from day one
on a phase I trial was 7 months (95% CI 6, 13). Median
PFS for 61 treated patients was 2.6 months (95% CI 1.9,
3.4) on phase I clinical trials. Among these 61 patients,
the median PFS on their first-line and second-line prior
therapies with FDA approved agents given in the advanced
setting was 4.4 months and 4.1 months, respectively. In
comparison, the PFS on the first line FDA-approved
therapy given in the advanced setting prior to Phase I
referral was improved compared to the PFS on phase I
therapy (p 0.019). However, the second-line therapy with
FDA-approved drugs was comparable to the PFS on a
phase I trial (p 0.27). The PFS on first-, second-line and
Phase I therapy are shown in Figure 2.
Among the 61 treated patients, 42 (69%) had died
at the time of analysis. The 90-day mortality was 38%
with 38 patients alive at 3 months after beginning phase I
therapy; the 6-month mortality was 61% with 24 patients
alive at 6 months after beginning therapy on phase I trials.
Importantly, there was no treatment-related mortality. One
patient treated on a combination regimen that included
sorafenib experienced grade 3 hand foot syndrome that
was not responsive to a dose reduction. This patient
ultimately showed disease progression on restaging
imaging. A second patient developed a mild headache,
dizziness and left-sided visual field blurriness five days
after beginning a sunitinib-based combination therapy
and was found to have a small right parieto-occipital
intracranial hemorrhage, possibly related to therapy. There
were no other high-grade toxicities reported.

Survival and toxicities

Fourteen patients were not restaged prior to end
of cycle 2 due to clinical deterioration and early disease
progression and are identified on the waterfall plot as
having a 20% increase in tumor size (Figure 1). Of the 61
patients treated on studies, 4 (7%) had a partial response
(PR), 23 had stable disease (38%) including 8 (13%) who
had SD > 6 months, with a SD > 6 months/PR rate of 20%
(12 of 61 patients); 10 of these 12 patients received an
oral or IV inhibitor of angiogenesis. The characteristics
and specific treatment regimens of these responders
are detailed in Table 2. Thirty-five patients (57%) had
progressive disease (PD). The highest response rates (SD
> 6 months/PR) were observed in patients treated with
protocols that included agents targeting angiogenesis
and mTOR. Of 10 patients who were treated on an HAIbased protocol, 3 (30%) has a significant clinical response
including two with prolonged SD > 6 months and 1 PR.
One dramatic response was observed in a 56year old Asian woman with metastatic HCC in setting
of hepatitis C, Child-Pugh class A. Her prior therapies
included sorafenib monotherapy and then a combination
of bevacizumab plus erlotinib. Upon progression, she
then enrolled on phase I therapy with regorafenib, then
a novel oral small molecular inhibitor of VEGFR2 and 3,
and Ret, Kit, PDGFR and Raf kinases. She demonstrated
a complete response of target lesions with stable nonmeasurable bone lesions, hence deemed a partial response
per RECIST, and has maintained this remarkable response
for 27 months ongoing. A second response was observed
in a 57-year old man who received HAI paclitaxel; he
demonstrated a complete response of target liver lesions
with stable post-embolization non-target hepatic masses,

Prognostic factors for survival

The multivariate analysis showed cirrhosis (p 0.038),
portal hypertension (p < 0.017), and serum sodium (p
0.0012) as predictors of shorter PFS on phase I therapy
while cirrhosis, white race and abnormal serum sodium
predicted for a shorter OS (Table 4).

We conducted univariate and multivariate analysis
to evaluate the effects on survival of variables including
age, sex, race/ethnicity, ECOG performance status,
risk factors for liver disease (alcohol abuse, hepatitis C,
hepatitis B), comorbidities (coronary artery disease, type
II diabetes), extent of liver disease (presence of cirrhosis,
portal hypertension, ascites, portal vein thrombosis),
alpha-fetoprotein; history of thromboembolism; number
of prior therapies; presence of liver metastases; number
of metastatic sites; hemoglobin level; platelet count;
and albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline
phosphatase, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase,
aspartate aminotransferase, sodium, and creatinine levels
(Table 3). Predictors of shorter Phase I PFS in univariate
analysis were the presence of cirrhosis (p 0.016), portal
hypertension (p 0.011), ascites (p 0.012), abnormal
sodium (p 0.028) and hypoalbuminemia (0.0013); these
five factors also predicted for shorter overall survival (p
0.012, 0.038, 0.013, 0.031, and <0.0001 respectively).

Molecular analysis
Testing for mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF,
CKIT, EGFR, PIK3CA, TP53, MET, GNAQ, AKT1,
ALK rearrangement as well as immunohistochemistry
for PTEN loss, ER, and ALK1 and HER-2/neu and MET
amplification via FISH was completed on patients with
adequate available tissue in the MD Anderson CLIAcertified laboratories. On immunohistochemistry, 10 of
19 tested patients demonstrated an abnormality in PTEN
expression with 7 tumors showing frank PTEN loss and
3 samples showing very faint PTEN expression (<10%
of stained cells). PCR-based DNA sequencing analysis
was performed in exons 4 to 9 of the TP53 gene. The
lower limit of detection is approximately one cell bearing

the mutation per five cells (20%). All 4 tested patients
demonstrated a TP53 aberration, one patient with a 12
base pair deletion in exon 4 and 3 patients with a missense
mutation in codon 177 in exon 5 (P177L), codon 158 in
exon 5 (R158H), and codon 272 in exon 8 (V272M). KIT,
PIK3CA, and MET mutations were found in individual
patients. The remainder of the mutational analyses was
negative including KRAS (all 19 tested), PIK3CA (17 of
18 tested), BRAF (all 17 tested), and EGFR (all 13 tested).

referred for phase I trials, 39% were ineligible mainly
due to decline in performance status (ECOG PS of 3 or
greater) and prohibitively abnormal laboratory values,
underscoring the importance of early participation in
clinical trials after progression on frontline therapy in the
metastatic setting.
Overall, the pattern of molecular aberrations
seen in HCC is slowly emerging. In our analysis, the
most common molecular aberration was observed in
the expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. We
observed complete loss or very faint PTEN expression
in 10 of 19 (53%) of tested tumor samples, highlighting
the therapeutic target potential of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway. Indeed activation of the mTOR signaling has
been demonstrated in HCC where immunohistochemical
analysis shows significantly elevated expression of
p-mTOR in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of HCC
tissue samples when comparison with non-cancerous
tissue such as normal liver, cirrhotic nodules, or hepatic
adenomas.[17, 18] Indeed, preclinical murine models of
HCC have demonstrated a greater degree of carcinoma
growth inhibition with the combination of bevacizumab
plus rapamycin treatment rather than monotherapy with
either agent.[19] Furthermore, mTOR inhibition with
rapamycin has been explored in the context of decreased
post-transplant tumor recurrence in patients receiving
sirolimus for immunosuppression.[20] Another metaanalysis investigated 2950 patients with resectable HCC
who underwent a liver transplantation; among these
patients, those who were placed on a sirolimus-based
regimen for immunosuppression had a decreased risk for
disease recurrence and an improvement in their overall
survival, highlighting the significant dual role of mTOR
inhibitors in this selected population.[21]
Another emerging molecular aberration is mutations
in the TP53 gene encoding the tumor suppressor protein
P53. Polymorphisms particularly in codon 72 of TP53
have been associated with increased risk for multiple
solid malignancies including high-grade serous ovarian
and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[22, 23]
In one series, TP53 mutations have been associated
with recurrence of HCC; indeed, 16 of 33 cases (49%) of
recurrent HCC were observed to harbor the P53 mutation;
additionally patients whose tumor had the P53 mutation
had a faster time to recurrence after surgical resection,
further supporting this mutation’s role in carcinogenesis.
[24]
Our analysis demonstrates several limitations. First,
a selection bias exists within our patient population given
that the patients presented with metastatic disease and
were heavily pretreated prior to the initiation of Phase
I therapy. Second, a significant number of patients (39
of 100 referred patients, 39%) were not enrolled on a
phase I trial for the most part due to poor overall health
and performance status. Finally, mutational analysis was
performed in a small subset of patients due to the lack of

DISCUSSION
Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in the
setting of Child-Pugh class A or B liver disease remains
a clinical challenge particularly after relapse on sorafenib
given in the metastatic setting. Alternate recommended
options include locoregional therapy with transarterial
chemoembolization, conformal or stereotactic radiation,
or clinical trial.[13] Multimodal approaches include
liver-directed therapies such as embolization with the
radionuclide yttrium-90.[14] However, for the patient with
extrahepatic disease, the need for novel targeted systemic
therapies and combination regimen is self-evident.
In our analysis, patterns of early signals suggesting
clinical activity emerged in regimens that target
angiogenesis particularly in combination with multikinase
inhibition using sorafenib. Of particular interest is the
observation of clinical response using a combination of
bevacizumab and sorafenib in our HCC patients who
have all previously received single-agent sorafenib.
These patients had demonstrated disease regression
with sorafenib monotherapy given as frontline agent
in the metastatic setting but subsequent development
of secondary resistance with disease progression. This
concept of successful retreatment after initial response
and subsequent progression has been explored in small
case series and provides an intriguing challenge to the
prevailing convention that a resistant tumor is unlikely
to respond to a rechallenge with a similar regimen.
[15, 16] Additional response signals were observed in
regimens utilizing intravenous angiogenesis inhibition
in combination with liver-directed infusion of cytotoxic
chemotherapy. Indeed ten of the twelve prolonged
responders received an angiogenesis inhibitor, of which
two were in combination with hepatic arterial infusion
therapy.
For the clinician faced with the relapsed advanced
HCC patient, the timing of referral for a clinical trial
remains essential point of decision. In our analysis,
frontline therapy with sorafenib given in the advanced
setting prior to phase I referral had an improved PFS
in comparison to the PFS in phase I clinical trial.
However the PFS on the second line therapy with FDAapproved agents given in the advanced setting prior to
phase I referral was comparable to the PFS on phase
I trial. Furthermore, in our analysis, of the 100 patients

Overall, the poor outcomes of advanced HCC
patients emphasize the need for new approaches.
Therapeutic strategies on clinical trials with inhibitor
of angiogenesis and multiple kinases merit further
exploration in phase II trials.

2 cycles (6-8 weeks) of therapy as per the protocol.[12]
Partial response (PR) was defined as a >30% decrease in
the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, excluding
complete disappearance of disease (complete response,
CR) and progressive disease (PD) was a > 20% increase.
Stable disease (SD) was defined as changes that did not
meet the criteria for a PR or PD. Waterfall plot analysis
according to RECIST is used to illustrate response.
Overall survival is defined as the date of enrollment
on a Phase I trial until death from any cause or date of
last follow-up. PFS is defined as the time from first day of
treatment on a phase I trial to date off study of last phase
I trial due to disease progression or death, not toxicity.
Patients still alive at time of survival analysis and free
of progression at time of PFS analysis were censored at
time of last follow-up. Toxicities were assessed using the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events, version per the protocol. A P-value
<.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
analysis was performed using S-PLUS® 8.0 for Windows
(Insightful Corp.).

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Of 3614 patients evaluated in the Clinical Center
for Targeted Therapy (Phase I Clinical Trials Program)
at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center from November
2004 onwards, we identified 100 consecutive patients
with HCC. After review of baseline clinical, laboratory,
radiologic and pathologic data during the initial
consultation, patients were enrolled on a phase I trial
based on scientific rationale and protocol availability.
After initiation of an investigational therapy, patients
were evaluated at 2- to 4- week intervals, based on the
specific protocol, with a history, physical examination,
comprehensive series of laboratory tests, and assessments
of toxicity and compliance. Restaging scans were done
every 6-8 weeks, depending on the protocol.
Specific eligibility criteria varied by protocol;
however, common criteria for participation in most
phase I clinical trials included presence of metastatic or
unresectable disease, measurable disease per Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),
and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status (PS) of 0-1 (although a PS of 2 is
acceptable for certain investigator-initiated studies).
This study and all clinical trials were approved by the
Institutional Review Board.

Endpoints and statistical methods
The statistical analysis was performed by our
biostatistician (K.R.H.). Descriptive statistics summarized
the patients’ characteristics. Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis was used to examine the association
between progression free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) since beginning phase I therapy and
the following variables measured at the time of initial
Phase I consultation: age at diagnosis, gender, ECOG
PS, etiology of liver disease (alcohol abuse, hepatitis B
and C, fatty liver disease, etc.), extent of liver disease
(cirrhosis, portal hypertension, portal vein thrombosis),
number of metastatic sites, number of prior therapies,
hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), platelet count,
history of thromboembolism, total bilirubin, aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
alkaline phosphatase (ALK), serum sodium, serum
creatinine, tumor markers (specifically alpha-fetoprotein),
and serum albumin.
