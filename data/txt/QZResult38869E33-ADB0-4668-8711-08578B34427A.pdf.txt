Abstract
Altered patterns of DNA methylation associated with Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection of gastric epithelial
cells are thought to contribute to gastric cancer risk. However, it is unclear whether this increased risk reflects
an infection-associated inflammatory response or the infection itself. In this study, we sought to clarify mechanisms in a gerbil model of gastric cancer where we showed that HP infection is causally involved in induction of aberrant DNA methylation. By genome-wide screening, CpG islands that were aberrantly
methylated in gerbil gastric cancer cell lines were isolated, and 10 islands were shown to be specifically methylated only in gastric mucosae infected with HP. By temporal analysis, methylation levels in gastric epithelial
cells started to increase at 5 to 10 weeks after infection and reached high levels by 50 weeks. When HP was
eradicated, methylation levels markedly decreased 10 and 20 weeks later, but they remained higher than those
in gerbils that were not infected by HP. Expression levels of several inflammation-related genes (CXCL2, IL-1β,
NOS2, and TNF-α) paralleled the temporal changes of methylation levels. Significantly suppressing inflammation with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A did not affect colonization by HP but blocked the induction of altered DNA methylation. Our findings argue that DNA methylation alterations that occur in gastric
mucosae after HP infection are composed of transient components and permanent components, and that it is
the infection-associated inflammatory response, rather than HP itself, which is responsible for inducing the
altered DNA methylation. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1430–40. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Aberrant DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands (CGI)
is one of the major inactivating mechanisms of tumorsuppressor genes and is deeply involved in human carcinogenesis (1). Nevertheless, there is only limited information
on its inducers and induction mechanisms. Chronic inflammation, known to promote certain types of cancers (2), is one
of the possible inducers of aberrant methylation. The presence of aberrant methylation is frequently observed in noncancerous tissues of patients with inflammation-associated
cancers, such as liver cancers, ulcerative colitis–associated
colon cancers, and gastric cancers (3–7). However, a causal
role of chronic inflammation in methylation induction remains to be established.

In human gastric mucosae, the presence of Helicobacter
pylori (HP) infection, a well-known inducer of chronic inflammation and gastric cancers (8, 9), is associated with high
methylation levels or high incidences of methylation (5, 10–
12). In addition, among individuals without HP infection,
noncancerous gastric mucosae of gastric cancer patients
have higher methylation levels than gastric mucosae of
healthy individuals (5, 10). In addition, eradication of HP
leads to a decreased incidence of CDH1 (E-cadherin) promoter methylation (11, 13, 14). These findings suggest that HP
infection induces aberrant methylation in gastric mucosae
and indicate that levels of accumulated methylation are associated with gastric cancer risk. However, because infection
experiments are impossible in humans, it needs to be clarified in animal models whether or not HP infection induces
methylation and what mechanisms are involved.
HP infection in humans is best modeled in Mongolian
gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). As in man, HP infection
induces severe inflammation in gerbil gastric mucosae and
promotes gastric carcinogenesis induced by administration
of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) or N-methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine (15). The incidence of gastric cancers in gerbils depends
on the duration of HP infection, and eradication of HP significantly reduces the incidence (16), as in man (17, 18). Thus, we
can expect that the gerbil model is also useful in analyzing
whether HP infection induces aberrant methylation and what
mechanisms are involved in vivo. However, unfortunately,

DNA Methylation Induced by H. pylori Infection

little information is available for the gerbil genome, and
the genetic and molecular analysis of this model has been
hampered.
In this study, we aimed to show that HP infection is causally involved in induction of aberrant DNA methylation and
to clarify a critical factor involved. For this, we first isolated
CGIs that could be methylated in gerbil gastric cancers by a
genome-wide screening method, methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis (MS-RDA). Using the CGIs isolated, we then showed that methylation was induced
specifically in gerbils with HP infection and that inflammation induced by HP infection, not HP itself, was critically involved in methylation induction.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Two gerbil gastric cancer cell lines, MGC1 and
MGC2, were established from a single gastric cancer induced
in a gerbil by MNU and HP infection (19). They were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum on a type I collagen–coated dish (Asahi Techno Glass).
Although we did not check the cross-contamination of cell
lines biochemically or genetically just before use, they had
the same morphology and growth rates as described previously (19).
Animal experiments and sample preparation. Male
Mongolian gerbils (MGS/Sea) were purchased from Kyudo.
To induce gastric cancers, male gerbils were administrated
with 30 ppm of MNU (Sigma-Aldrich) in drinking water for
a week at 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 wk of age, and then inoculated
with HP (ATCC 43504, American Type Culture Collection) by
gavage at 17 wk of age (20). At 57 wk, gerbils were sacrificed
and stomachs were resected. Because it was difficult to identify cancers macroscopically in gastric mucosae with severe
hyperplasia, we dissected an area of gastric cancer tissue by
an apparatus for laser microdissection (ASLMD, Leica Microsystems) after histologic confirmation. For temporal analysis
of methylation levels, male gerbils were inoculated with HP
(ATCC 43504) at 5 wk of age. Eradication therapy was done
at 55 wk of age by administering amoxicillin, clarithromycin,
and lansoprazole by gavage (20). Gerbils that had HP after
the eradication therapy were excluded from analysis. As a vehicle control, 0.5% of carboxymethyl cellulose was given by
gavage. To suppress gastritis, gerbils were administered with
250 μg/mL cyclosporin A (CsA; Neoral, Novartis Pharma) in
drinking water for 20 wk. The stomach was resected and cut
along the greater curvature. From the posterior wall of the
pyloric region (pyloric antrum), which contains the pyloric
glands, gastric epithelial cells (GEC) were isolated by the
gland isolation technique (21). The anterior wall of the pyloric region was further cut into two pieces: one for RNA and
DNA extraction from a sample with mucus and mucosal and
submucosal layers and the other for histologic analysis.
Whole blood was obtained from the inferior vena cava. The
animal experiment protocols were approved by the Committee for Ethics in Animal Experimentation.
Human clinical samples. Human gastric mucosae were
obtained by endoscopic biopsy from 10 HP-negative (five

men and five women; average age 42.4 y, ranging from 29
to 56 y) and 10 HP-positive (four men and six women; average age 42.4 y, ranging from 23 to 53 y) healthy volunteers,
whose HP status had been judged by a serum anti-HP antibody test (SBS). Gastric cancer samples were obtained from
surgical specimens from 14 patients who underwent gastrectomy due to early gastric cancers (seven men and seven
women; average age 65.9 y, ranging from 47 to 79 y). Sampling was conducted under the approval of Institutional
Review Boards.
Nucleic acid extraction. From tissue sections, DNA was
extracted by heating the dissected sections at 100°C for 20
min at pH 12, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction
(22). From isolated glands, DNA was extracted by proteinase
K digestion and the phenol/chloroform method. From the
whole blood, DNA was extracted with a QuickGene DNA
whole blood kit (Fujifilm). RNA was isolated with Isogen
(Wako).
Quantitative PCR for gene expression analyses and
HP detection. To analyze gene expression levels, cDNA was
synthesized from 2 μg of DNase-treated RNA with an oligo-d
(T)12–18 primer. Real-time PCR using gene-specific primers
(Supplementary Table S1) and SYBR Green Real-time PCR
Master Mix (TOYOBO) was done, and the amplification curve
of a sample was compared with curves of standard DNA
samples with known copy numbers. Standard DNA samples
were prepared by serial dilution of a PCR product or a plasmid containing a cloned PCR fragment after its quantification. Gene expression levels were normalized to that of
Gapdh. To measure the amount of HP, real-time PCR using
specific primers for the jhpr3 gene of HP was carried out and
normalized to the gerbil Il4 gene (Supplementary Table S1).
Methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis. MS-RDA is a subtraction method that can identify differentially methylated loci between two genomes independent
of genomic information (23) and was done using HpaII or
SacII methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme as described
previously (24). The final PCR product was cloned into pGEM
T-Easy (Promega) and sequenced. If a DNA fragment had a
CpG score ≥0.65 and G + C content ≥55%, the fragment was
considered to be derived from a CGI. To identify homologous
regions in mice and men, database searches were carried out
at a GenBank web site.
Methylation analysis. Fully methylated and fully unmethylated controls were prepared by methylating genomic
DNA with SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) and amplifying genomic DNA with ϕ29 DNA polymerase (GenomiPhi
DNA Amplification Kit, GE Healthcare), respectively (25).
One microgram of DNA digested with BamHI was treated
with sodium bisulfite and suspended in 80 μL of Tris-EDTA
(TE) buffer as described previously (22). In the case of
paraffin-embedded samples, DNA was treated with sodium
bisulfite without BamHI digestion and suspended in 20 μL
of TE buffer. One microliter of aliquot was used as a template
for methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing.
Conventional MSP and bisulfite sequencing were done
with specific primer sets (Supplementary Table S2) as described previously (22). Quantitative MSP (qMSP) was done

by real-time PCR using primers specific to DNA molecules
methylated at a locus and to a repeat sequence. Methylation
levels were expressed as a percentage of the methylated reference, which was obtained as [(number of methylated fragments of a target CGI in sample) / (number of repeat
sequences in sample)] / [(number of methylated fragments
of a target CGI in SssI-treated DNA) / (number of repeat sequences in SssI-treated DNA)] × 100. As a repeat sequence,
the B2 repeat was used for gerbil DNA (ref. 26; Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S1) and the Alu repeat
was used for human DNA (27).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted
with SPSS 13.0J (SPSS Japan, Inc.). To evaluate significant difference between two independent groups of sample data, the
Mann-Whitney U test was used. Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient (r) was used to measure correlation.

Results
Identification of CGIs specifically methylated by HP
infection in GECs of Mongolian gerbils. To identify CGIs
methylated in GECs of gerbils with HP infection, we adopted
the strategy of a genome-wide screening in cancers and highsensitivity analysis in GECs. The genome-wide screening was
done by MS-RDA using a pool of two gerbil gastric cancer cell
lines (MGC1 and MGC2) as the driver and GECs of noninfected gerbils as the tester. The final products of two series of
MS-RDA using HpaII and SacII were cloned and 180 DNA
fragments were sequenced. One hundred three of them were

nonredundant, and 56 of them contained a sequence likely to
have originated from a CGI. Due to the lack of information
on the gerbil genome, we first analyzed the methylation statuses of CpG sites within the DNA fragments isolated using
MSP. MSP primers were successfully designed for 27 of the 56
DNA fragments, and we analyzed the two gastric cancer cell
lines, five samples of GECs from gerbils infected with HP for
50 weeks, and five samples of GECs from age-matched gerbils
without infection. Ten (HE6, HG2, SA9, SB1, SB5, SC3, SD2,
SE3, SF12, and SH6) of the 27 DNA fragments were methylated in the cell lines and GECs of HP-infected gerbils, but not
in any GECs of gerbils without infection (Table 1; Fig. 1). The
others were methylated only in the cell lines or methylated
even in GECs of gerbils without infection.
Methylation in primary gastric cancers was analyzed for
three randomly selected CGIs (HE6, SA9, and SB5). The
methylation levels of HE6 and SB5 in eight primary cancer
samples were similar to or below the mean methylation levels in GECs with HP infection for 50 weeks. In contrast, the
methylation level of SA9 in most cancer samples was 2.1- to
19.1-fold higher than the mean methylation level in GECs
from HP-infected gerbils (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggested that HP infection induced aberrant methylation of multiple but specific CGIs in gerbil GECs, and that
methylation of some of these CGIs was associated with
growth advantage of the cells.
Methylation of the corresponding CGIs in human samples. To examine whether or not these CGIs are also methylated in humans by HP infection, conserved regions of the

DNA Methylation Induced by H. pylori Infection

10 gerbil CGIs in humans were searched for. Eight of the 10
CGIs were found to be conserved between gerbils and humans (marked in Table 1), and five were located in the vicinities of genes (Fig. 2A, left). When the methylation levels of
these five CGIs were quantified in human gastric mucosal biopsies, all of them had 5- to 48-fold higher methylation levels
in individuals with HP infection (n = 10) than in those without (n = 10; right). Their methylation levels had close correlation with each other (correlation coefficient = 0.70–0.88;
Supplementary Table S3).
The methylation levels of the five CGIs were then analyzed
in primary human gastric cancers. NTRK2, GPR37, NOL4, and
NPTX2 had methylation in seven, three, four, and five, respectively, of 14 cancers analyzed, using the average methylation
level of mucosal biopsies of HP-infected healthy volunteers as
a threshold. There was no case with methylation of RNF152
(Fig. 2B). These results showed that some of these CGIs were
also methylated in human gastric cancers.
Induction of DNA methylation by chronic HP infection.
Using the 10 CGIs isolated by MS-RDA, the effect of HP infection on methylation induction was analyzed at 1, 5, 10,

and 50 weeks after HP infection (Fig. 3A). The methylation
levels of HG2, SB5, and SD2 started to increase at 5 weeks
after infection. At 10 weeks, CGIs other than SE3 and SH6
showed significantly higher methylation levels than those
of the noninfected gerbils (3.2- to 85.0-fold). At 50 weeks,
all the CGIs showed significantly higher methylation levels
(14.3- to 215-fold; Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggested that chronic HP infection, not acute HP infection, was responsible for methylation induction.
The presence of dense methylation (methylation of a majority of CpG sites on a single DNA molecule) was confirmed
by bisulfite sequencing of HE6 and SA9 in GECs of two gerbils with HP infection and two without. Densely methylated
DNA molecules were detected only in HP-infected gerbils
(Fig. 3C). The vast majority of DNA molecules were either
largely unmethylated or largely methylated, and the fraction
of methylated DNA molecules was in accordance with methylation levels measured by qMSP. The methylation levels of
the 10 CGIs closely correlated with each other (average correlation coefficient = 0.87; range 0.70–0.95; Fig. 3D; Supplementary Table S4).
Decrease in methylation levels after HP eradication. HP
was eradicated at 50 weeks after infection, and the methylation levels of the 10 CGIs were measured in GECs of the gerbils before and 1, 10, and 20 weeks after the eradication
(Fig. 3A). Complete absence of HP was confirmed by PCR
of HP genomic DNA (Fig. 4C). At 1 week after eradication,
no decrease in methylation was observed (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S3). At 10 weeks after eradication, in contrast,
the methylation levels of the 10 CGIs decreased to 9% to 32%
of those before the eradication (significant for 9 of the 10
CGIs, except for SH6). An additional 10 weeks (20 weeks after
eradication) did not lead to a further decrease in methylation
levels. Importantly, the methylation levels after the decrease
due to eradication were still significantly (P < 0.01 for two
CGIs, and P < 0.05 for seven CGIs) higher than those in gerbils without any HP infection in their life.
Close association between methylation induction and
inflammation, and not HP itself. HP infection is known to
induce severe inflammation in gastric mucosae in gerbils, as
in humans. Histologic analysis revealed that infiltration of
polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear cells started at
5 to 10 weeks after HP infection, and it became severe at
50 weeks (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S4). After eradication,
a decrease in infiltration was not clear at 1 week, but was
marked by 10 and 20 weeks (Fig. 4A). These histologic findings were paralleled by expression of inflammatory cell markers [Cd3g, Cd14, Ela2, and Ms4a1 (Cd20) for T cell,
macrophage, neutrophil, and B cell, respectively] in gastric
tissues containing both mucosal and submucosal layers
(Fig. 4B). Although Ms4a1 expression decreased after eradication, gerbils without eradication (continuous infection) also
showed a similar decrease, indicating that the decrease in
Ms4a1 expression (B-cell infiltration) was independent of
HP eradication.
To explore the components of inflammation associated
with methylation induction, the expression of inflammation-related genes [Cox2, Cxcl2 (MIP-2), Ifng, Il1b, Il2, Il4,

Niwa et al.

Il6, Il7, Nos2 (iNos), and Tnf (Tnf-α)] was also quantified
(Fig. 4B). A marked increase after HP infection and a decrease after eradication were observed for Cxcl2, Il1b, Nos2,
and Tnf, paralleling inflammatory cell markers (Fig. 4B).
The Cox2, Ifng, Il2, Il4, and Il6 expression did not parallel
the methylation levels after HP eradication, and the Il7 expression showed a paradoxical increase compared with the
group of continuous infection (Fig. 4B). Regarding the
amount of HP in gastric mucosae, it had no association with
methylation levels (Fig. 4C).
There remained a possibility that inflammatory cells had
methylation of the CGIs analyzed, and that their contamination into GECs led to an apparent increase in methylation

levels. To exclude this possibility, we analyzed the methylation levels of the 10 CGIs in DNA extracted from the whole
blood of HP-infected gerbils. With the exception of SB1 and
SB5, which showed relatively high methylation levels in the
blood, 8 of the 10 CGIs showed almost no methylation (Supplementary Fig. S5). This excluded the possibility that methylation detected in the GECs was due to methylation in
inflammatory cells contaminating the GECs.
Suppression of methylation induction by suppression of
inflammation. To conclude that inflammation is indispensable for methylation induction, we suppressed HP-induced
inflammation by administration of CsA, which blocks T-cell
activation through inhibition of the calcineurin signal

(ref. 28; Fig. 5A). Macroscopically, administration of CsA to
HP-infected gerbils markedly suppressed erosion and the
formation of nodules. Histologically, it suppressed induction
of hyperplasia almost completely, but infiltration of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells remained (Fig. 5B).
Importantly, the number of HP colonized in the stomach
was not affected by the CsA treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S6). The expression levels of inflammatory cell markers
(Cd3g, Cd14, and Ela2) were not reduced, indicating that the

number of inflammatory cells normalized against other cells
was not affected. However, the expression of three inflammation-related genes (Cxcl2, Il1b, and Nos2), whose expression paralleled methylation induction in the temporal
analysis, was significantly reduced by the CsA treatment
(Fig. 5C).
The DNA methylation levels of the 10 CGIs were markedly
reduced in GECs of CsA-treated gerbils (0% to 28% of methylation levels of GECs from HP-infected gerbil without the

CsA treatment; Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S7). These results
showed that the CsA treatment suppressed inflammatory
responses but not HP colonization, and that the suppression
of inflammatory responses markedly repressed methylation
induction.
Expression analysis of genes with promoter methylation
in HP-infected GECs. HG2, SC3, and SD2 were located in the

Promoter CGIs are generally resistant to DNA methylation
(29), and only when genes are transcribed at low levels are
they susceptible to DNA methylation (30–32). To confirm
the low expression and the effect of methylation on gene expression, we analyzed their expression levels in GECs isolated
from gerbils with and without HP infection (10 and 50 weeks

after infection) and in gastric cancer cell lines. All the three
genes showed low expression levels in the GECs of noninfected and infected gerbils (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Rnf152 expression was significantly decreased in HP-infected
gerbils compared with noninfected gerbils (44% and 25% at
10 and 50 weeks, respectively, after infection; P < 0.001). None
of the three genes were expressed in cancer cell lines with
complete methylation of these CGIs (Fig. 1B; Supplementary
Fig. S8, top).
The absence of DNA methyltransferase upregulation.
DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt) are final effectors of maintenance and induction of DNA methylation, and their overexpression is frequently observed in various types of human
cancers (33). To analyze possible upregulation of Dnmts by
HP infection, expression levels of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and
Dnmt3b mRNAs were quantified in GECs of gerbils with
and without HP infection. Contrary to our initial expectation,
the expression levels of the three Dnmts were significantly
lower in GECs with HP infection (1/2 to 1/3) than those without (Supplementary Fig. S8, bottom).

Discussion
Our study using a gerbil model showed that HP infection is
causally involved in induction of aberrant DNA methylation
in GECs. Thus far, a strong association has been shown between the presence of HP infection and high methylation levels or high incidence of methylation in human gastric
mucosae (5, 10–12). Taking advantage of an animal model,
we were able to conduct an experiment by infecting gerbils
with HP and showed that HP infection was the cause of
methylation induction.
The critical role of inflammation in methylation induction
was shown. Temporal analysis showed that methylation levels were closely associated with infiltration of inflammatory
cells, and suppression of inflammation by CsA markedly repressed methylation induction even in the presence of HP.
These results indicated that HP itself was not necessary for
methylation induction once inflammation was induced by it.
This finding is important because a direct role of HP is suggested by the facts that the SHP2 oncoprotein is deregulated
by injection of virulent factors such as CagA into GECs (34)
and HP possesses multiple DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (35).
Among the inflammation-related genes analyzed, the expression levels of Cxcl2, Il1b, Nos2, and Tnf were upregulated
in the stomach with HP infection and decreased after eradication, almost paralleling those of methylation levels. In the
CsA treatment, in which methylation induction was markedly suppressed, upregulation of Cxcl2, Il1b, and Nos2 by HP infection was significantly suppressed and that of Tnf also had
a tendency to be suppressed. These results suggest that some
specific inflammation-related genes are cooperatively involved in methylation induction by HP infection. In human
ulcerative colitis and hepatitis (cirrhosis), where aberrant
methylation is believed to be induced, increased expression
of IL8 (human functional homolog of Cxcl2), IL1B, NOS2, and
TNF was also observed (36–39), suggesting that upregulation

1438

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

of these genes is a common feature of methylation-associated
inflammation. Especially for human IL1B, its allele with a specific single nucleotide polymorphism is known to be associated with increased gastric cancer risk and increased incidence
of CDH1 promoter methylation in gastric cancers (40, 41).
Also, increased production of nitric oxide, due to upregulation
of a nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) by IL1B or administration of
nitric oxide donors, induced methylation of FMR1 and HPRT
genes in vitro (42).
This study also clearly shows that methylation in gastric
mucosae with HP infection consists of temporary and permanent components, which has been suggested by studies in
humans (5, 10). Methylation that disappeared after eradication corresponds to the temporary component, and methylation that did not disappear corresponds to the permanent
component. A pyloric gland (mucosal epithelia) is known to
be composed of one or a few stem cells, multiple progenitor
cells, and a large number of differentiated cells, and it is renewed within 3 to 14 days (43, 44). Temporary methylation is
likely to have been induced in progenitor or differentiated
cells, which will finally drop off from the gastric epithelium.
Permanent methylation is likely to be induced in stem cells,
which will remain for life. In humans, methylation levels in
gastric mucosae without HP infection correlate with gastric
cancer risk (5, 10), and this fact is also in line with the hypothesis that permanent methylation in gastric mucosae
without HP infection reflects methylation in stem cells.
HG2, SC3, and SD2 were methylated in GECs, although
they were located in promoter CGIs, which are generally resistant to DNA methylation (29). Among promoter CGIs,
those of genes with low transcription are known to be susceptible to methylation (30, 31, 45), and as expected, all the
three genes had low transcription levels in GECs. Transcription levels at 10−4 to 10−3/Gapdh (GAPDH) correspond to 1 to
10 copies of mRNA per cell and are less than 35% of the average expression level of all the genes analyzed by expression
microarray (46). Because their methylation levels in GECs of
gerbils infected with HP for 10 and 50 weeks were less than a
few percent, their methylation was unlikely to have affected
the overall expression levels in gastric mucosae. As a response to HP infection, Rnf152 was downregulated whereas
Gpr37 and Nptx2 were not.
Promoter CGIs of GPR37 and NPTX2 were highly methylated in human gastric mucosae with HP infection and were
frequently methylated in human gastric cancers. Because
their tumor-suppressive functions have not been reported
and they are not expressed in normal gastric mucosae (RefExA database4), their silencing is unlikely to be causally involved in gastric carcinogenesis, and they are considered to
be passengers. Likewise, methylated CGIs that were not associated with genes were likely to be passengers. However, it is
now known that a lot of passengers and limited number of
drivers are methylated to high and small degrees, respectively, in human gastric mucosae with HP infection (5, 45).
Therefore, although most methylation identified here was

considered to be passenger, it is likely that tumor-suppressor
genes are also methylated in association with their methylation. Gastric mucosa with accumulation of silencing of
various genes, including both drivers and passengers, is considered to form a field where cancers will develop (epigenetic
field for cancerization; refs. 7, 10, 47).
As a final effector of methylation induction, we examined
overexpression of Dnmts, which are implicated in methylation induction in various human cancers (33). Unexpectedly,
all the three Dnmts were downregulated by HP infection. Our
recent data in humans also showed that mRNA levels of
Dnmts had decreasing tendencies in HP-infected gastric mucosae (45). These results indicate that overexpression of
Dnmts is not involved in HP-induced methylation induction,
and suggest that local distribution of Dnmts and/or protective factors, such as the presence of RNA polymerase II (48),
might be disturbed by inflammation.
Genome-wide screening to isolate DNA fragments methylated by HP infection was done by MS-RDA, which is applicable to any species without genome information. We used cell
lines as the driver so that we could avoid heterogeneity of
primary samples and aberrant methylation will be present
in all the DNA molecules in the driver. This was considered
to be essential for a genome-wide screening because most
methods cannot detect small differences. Although cell lines
might have artificial methylation, we confirmed the presence
of specific methylation in GECs, and a high-sensitivity meth-

od, qMSP, was used for this. As expected, methylation
levels of CGIs identified here were small (i.e., a few percent)
in GECs with HP infection, showing that the strategy was
correct.
In summary, HP infection was causally involved in induction of aberrant DNA methylation, and a critical role of inflammation in the induction was indicated. This model is
expected to be useful in analyzing detailed molecular mechanisms for induction of aberrant DNA methylation.
