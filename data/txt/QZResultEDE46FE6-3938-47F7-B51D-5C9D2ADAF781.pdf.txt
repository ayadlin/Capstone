Abstract
Telomere maintenance is critical in tumor cell immortalization. Here, we report that the cytokine bone morphogenetic
protein-7 (BMP7) inhibits telomerase activity that is required
for telomere maintenance in cervical cancer cells. Application
of human recombinant BMP7 triggers a repression of the
human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, shortening of telomeres, and hTERT repression–dependent cervical
cancer cell death. Continuous treatment of mouse xenograft
tumors with BMP7, or silencing the hTERT gene, results in
sustained inhibition of telomerase activity, shortening of
telomeres, and tumor growth arrest. Overexpression of hTERT
lengthens telomeres and blocks BMP7-induced tumor growth
arrest. Thus, BMP7 negatively regulates telomere maintenance,
inducing cervical tumor growth arrest by a mechanism of
inducing hTERT gene repression. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9157–66]

Introduction
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) operate through autocrine
and paracrine mechanisms to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during development (1, 2). Similar to other
transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) family members, BMPs bind
cell membrane type I and II receptors of serine/threonine kinases
eliciting intracellular signaling via Smad1, Smad5, Smad8 and
Smad9 proteins (3, 4), and the Lim kinase (5, 6), and mitogenactivated protein kinase pathways (7, 8). BMPs are present
in cancers including breast, prostate, and colon cancers (9–11)
where BMPs are implicated in regulating cancer cell proliferation
(8, 12–14). BMP7 (osteogenic protein-1) is a potent inducer of cell
differentiation required for vertebrate development, deletion of
which is postnatal-lethal with multiple defects in differentiated
tissues (15). Recent studies show that BMP7 maintains epithelial
and endothelial phenotypes against epithelial-mesenchymal transition (16, 17). BMP7 inhibits cancer cell proliferation causing
apoptosis of myeloma cells (12) and prostate cancer cells (13, 18),
and inhibits breast (19) and prostate (16) cancer metastasis.
However, apart from BMP7 antagonizing TGF-h–mediated proinvasive and protumorigenic effects (16, 17, 19), the exact
mechanisms in gene expression underlying these inhibitory actions
of BMP7 in cancer remain unknown.
Cancer cells hold unlimited proliferative potential as the cells
maintain their telomeres (ends of chromosomes) when they divide.
Most cancer cells maintain telomeres by mechanisms requiring the
ribonucleoprotein complex telomerase (20). Telomerase is thus

crucial to cancer cell proliferation toward immortalization.
Containing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT),
human RNA template component, and its binding protein dyskerin,
telomerase catalyses telomeric DNA synthesis and protects
telomere ends (21–23). As the catalyst of telomerase complex,
hTERT is rate limiting and expressed specifically in most cancers to
maintain short telomeres. Ectopic expression of hTERT lengthens
telomeric DNA, stabilizes telomeres, and mediates cell immortalization (24, 25). Inhibition of hTERT by gene silencing, dominantnegative gene expression, or substrate competitive inhibitors
accelerates telomere shortening and thereby triggers cancer cell
senescence and apoptosis in cell cultures and tumors (24, 25).
To date, little is known of how hTERT is regulated in cells by
extracellular cues. Considerable evidence indicates that when
normal cells differentiate in most tissues and organs, hTERT gene
expression becomes repressed, conferring a limited length of
telomeres and therefore proliferative potential on cells (26, 27).
Repression of the hTERT gene occurs at the gene transcription level
under a concerted regulation by a number of transcription factors
and repressors (28–30). We hypothesize that extracellular factors
regulating cell differentiation exert an effect on hTERT gene
expression, telomerase activity, and telomere maintenance through
intracellular signaling. Studies from our laboratory and others
show that TGF-h can induce an hTERT gene repression (30–35). In
the present study, we have examined effects of the BMP family on
telomerase activity and telomere maintenance in cervical cancer
cells. We show that BMP7 induces sustained telomerase inhibition
and telomere shortening in vitro and in vivo, resulting in cancer cell
apoptosis by a mechanism involving the repression of the hTERT
gene and telomerase activity.

Materials and Methods
Cytokines, gene expression plasmids, and antibodies. Human
recombinant BMP 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were from R & D systems. Plasmid
pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-C1-hTERT, and pEGFP-C1-hTERT shRNA were produced
in this laboratory. For hTERT shRNA, the oligonucleotide (5¶-AATTCAAAAAGGGTCTTTCTACCAGAGGTGCTTCTCTTGAAATCATCTCTGGTAGCAAGACC-3) was annealed and cloned to the EcoR1 site downstream
of the U6 promoter. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. The
primary antibodies of mouse anti–c-myc, mouse anti-p53, and mouse antip21 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, rabbit anti-p16 were from Cell
Signaling Technology, mouse anti-actin were from Chemicon, and
horseradish peroxidase–coupled second antibodies were from Dako.
Cell culture and treatment. Human cervical cancer HeLa cells were
grown in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37jC in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 6-well plastic plates or 10-cm dishes
(Nunc). Recombinant BMP proteins at concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 3, 10, and
30 ng/mL were added to cell cultures for various periods of time as
indicated in individual experiments, in which the serum concentration was
0.5% in the cell culture medium. Cells were lysed in ice cold CAHPS lysis
buffer (0.5% 3-[(Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate,
10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.1 mmol/L
benzamidine, 5 mmol/L h-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol), in the

presence of complete mini protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostic). Clarified
cell lysates were normalized for total protein concentrations by the
Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). To reverse BMP7 inhibition of telomerase,
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-hTERT was expressed by transfection with
pEGFP-C2-hTERT plasmid, with pEGPF-C2 plasmid as control. Cell
transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. After 24 h of transfection, cells
positive for GFP were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting,
cultured, and incubated with BMP2, 4, 5, 6, or 7 for different periods of time
and analyzed in Western blotting, semiquantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) for gene expressions, telomerase activity assay, and cell death
analysis, as indicated in individual experiments.
FACS. GFP-transfected cells were sorted using FACSAria flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences). The GFP-positive cells were reseeded into 6-well plates at
a density of 0.2  106 cells/mL in DMEM plus 10% FBS including
Gentamicin antibiotics (Pfizer). For apoptosis analysis, after treatment of
cells as indicated in individual experiments, cells were dislodged from tissue
culture plates using 0.5M EDTA for 5 min at 37jC and incubated with
annexin-V-FLUOS conjugate (Roche Diagnostic) and propidium iodide
(PI; Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature in an incubation buffer that
facilitates binding per the manufacturers’ instructions. The cells were then
analyzed using FL-2 and FL-3 channel, respectively. Percentages of stained
apoptotic cells were determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences). An acquisition gate was set to include f20,000 of the
centrally located cells for each sample acquisition using linear forward
scatter versus linear side scatter. This acquisition strategy resulted in
f40,000 ungated events being included for each sample analysis. Dot-plot
integration was determinate from the background fluorescence using
unstained HeLa cells. This integration cursor placement remained
unchanged when stained HeLa cells were analyzed.
Preparation of protein extracts and Western blotting. These
procedures were described previously (30). Briefly, tumor cells were treated
by CHAP lysis buffer, including protein inhibitors (Roche Diagnostic), at 4jC
and homogenized immediately. The lysates were incubated for 10 min on
ice and then centrifuged for 45 min at 5,000  rpm, then centrifuged again
for 30 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatants were collected and stored at
80jC. Extracted proteins (f25 Ag) in SDS sample buffer were boiled and
electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto
a pre-wet nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The blotted
nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in PBS containing 5% skim milk and
0.02% Tween 20, and probed with antibodies as indicated in individual
experiments at 4jC overnight. The blots were developed using enhanced
chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences).
RNA isolation and gene expression analysis. As previously described
(30), total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA (1 Ag) was transcribed by
oligo(dT) and ThermoScript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a volume
of total 21 AL. Contaminants were removed from the samples by Rnase H
treatment, according to manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen). Linear
amplification for semiquantitative PCR was performed using ThermoScript
RT-PCR kit following the manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen), for
25 to 35 cycles of 30 s at 72jC as the optimized annealing temperature
and 64jC extension. Primers specific for different genes were as follows:
hTERT (5¶-CCACCTTGACAAAGTACAG-3¶) and (5¶-CGTCCAGACTCCGCTTCAT-3¶), and Actin (5¶-GCTCGTCGTCGACAACGGCTC-3¶) and (5¶-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCSTCTTCTC-3¶). Actin was used as control. PCR
produces were mixed with 6 loading dye (30% glycerol, 0.5 mol/L EDTA,
and Bromophenol Blue) and run on 1.5% Agarose gel, visualized in the
presence of ethidium bromide, photographed in a gel 1000 UV documentation system (Bio-Rad), and analyzed by densitometry.
Telomerase activity assay. Telomerase activity was determined by
TRAP as described previously (36). Briefly, cells treated with different
reagents were washed and lysed by detaching and passing the cells though a
261/2G needle attached to a 1-mL syringe in prechilled TRAP lysis buffer.
Equal amounts of telomerase protein extract (0.4 Ag) were incubated with
telomeric DNA substrate and deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and newly

synthesized telomeric DNAs were observed after PCR using specific
telomeric DNA primers and [a-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography. As an internal
control of the PCR and loading, the primers NT (ATCGCTTCTCGGCCTTTT) and TSNT (AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTTAAAAGGCCGAGAAGCGAT) were included in the reaction.
Telomere length analysis. For telomeres in cultured cells, metaphase
spreads from cycling HeLa cells that were treated with or without BMP7
(30 ng/mL, 15 h) thrice per week for 2 wk were generated using standard
laboratory protocols. The slides of metaphase cells or tumor sections were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde before treatment with acidified 1% pepsin
solution, and hybridized with the probe solution [0.3 Ag/mL Cy3-conjugated
[CCCTAA]3 PNA probe (Panagene), 70% formamide, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.0), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)]. Washing was conducted in PBS/
Tween 20 with one high stringent wash at 57jC. DNA was counterstained
with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, visualized, and captured using Nikon
Eclipse TE2000 microscope, Plan Fluor 40 objective, DS-5MC CCD
camera, and NIS-Elements F 2.20 software (Nikon). Telomere images were
captured with a Plan Fluor 100 oil emersion objective, and individual
telomere fluorescence was integrated using spot IOD analysis in the TFLTelo 2.2 program (gift from Dr. Peter Lansdorp, Vancouver, Canada; ref. 37).
Images from at least 13 metaphase spreads from each data point were
quantified before assembly of data in a standard spreadsheet program. At
least 50 cell nuclei from each condition were analyzed.
Tumor cell growth analysis in soft agar. Tumor cell colonies were
grown in soft agar to assess the effects of BMP7 on tumor growth in vitro.
Two milliliters of mixture of 2 DMEM containing 20% FBS were used to
make 0.5% agar (base layer) with or without BMP7 in a 35-mm culture
dish or 6-well plate. On top of the base layer, a mixture of serum
supplemented medium and 0.35% agar (2 mL) containing 2,500 HeLa cells
in the presence or absence of BMP7 (100 ng/mL or as indicated; top layer)
was added. The dishes were kept in tissue culture incubator at 37jC and
5% CO2 for 14 d to allow for colony formation and growth. All assays were
performed in triplicates. The colony assay results were photographed or
scanned after the plates were stained with methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium (MTT).
Tumor xenografting and treatment procedure. HeLa cells were
xenografted in female nude mice (BALB/c Nude; Animal Resources Centre
ARC). Cultured monolayer cells were detached by trypsinization, washed in
PBS, and counted. Approximately 10  106 cells were resuspended in 0.1 mL
PBS and inoculated s.c. in the flank of the mice. Twenty-four hours after
inoculation, BMPs and other reagents prescribed as indicated in individual
experiments were administered into the xenografts on every second day.
The development of xenograft tumors was measured with Vernier callipers
before each treatment. The animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide
asphyxiation when tumor growth in the controls reached 20 mm in
diameter. Immediately after culling, the tumors were removed, measured,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80jC for further analyses.
The mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at
constant temperature (f22jC) and humidity (f40%). Sterilized food and
water were given ad libitum.
Tumor tissue sectioning and staining. Freshly dissected tumor
samples were embedded in ornithine carbamyl transferase compound
and frozen using isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen. Five-micrometer
fresh-frozen sections were prepared and used to stain for the Ki67
antigen, a marker of cell proliferation. Sections were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde/10% sucrose, washed once in PBS, and blocked with
5% BSA (Fraction V; Sigma) for 30 min. Sections were incubated with
polyclonal rabbit anti-Ki67 antibodies (ab15580; Abcam) at 4jC overnight
at a 1:400 dilution. Primary antibody was detected with Cy3-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Chemicon) for 90 min at a 1:200 dilution.
Nuclei were stained with 0.5 Ag/AL Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). The staining
was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Five random images within
the tumor area were analyzed in 3 sections, f5 Am apart, for each
treatment group.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using Student’s t tests and a
P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

BMP7 Induces Telomere Shortening in Cervical Tumors

Results
BMP7 induces telomerase inhibition and telomere shortening in cultured cancer cells. To investigate a potential role of the
BMP family in telomerase activity, we examined effects of BMP2,
BMP4, BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7 by spiking the medium of cancer
cell cultures with purified recombinant human cytokines.
Incubation of human cervical cancer HeLa cells with different
concentrations of BMP7 for 48 hours resulted in significant
inhibition of telomerase activity (Fig. 1A). The maximal inhibition
was f85% inhibition of telomerase activity, achieved with the
median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of BMP7 of 8 F 0.6 ng/mL
and the maximal inhibitory concentration of 35 F 1.4 ng/mL
(n = 3; Fig. 1B). Incubations of the cells with BMP2, BMP4, BMP5,
or BMP6 showed no significant inhibitory effect on telomerase
activity (data not shown). In the time course studies, BMP7
(10 ng/mL) induced telomerase inhibition in 24 hours of the
treatment for f3 days (Fig. 1B). To determine the inhibitory
effect on telomerase in another cancer cell type, we tested human
breast cancer PMC42 cells with different concentrations of BMP7.
As shown in Fig. 1C, BMP7 induced significant inhibition of
telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in PMC42 cells.

To verify that the inhibition of telomerase activity in HeLa and
breast cancer cells was at the levels of gene expression of hTERT,
we measured hTERT mRNA by semiquantitative RT-PCR. As
shown in Fig. 1D, BMP7 induced a significant down-regulation of
hTERT gene expression in both HeLa and PMC42 cells.
In addition, we noted that BMP7 also induced a significant
down-regulation of c-myc gene expression (Fig. 1D ). The
inhibition of c-myc gene expression was f80% of control, and
the inhibition of hTERT gene expression was f70% of the control
(Fig. 1D).
To determine the effect of BMP7 on telomeres, we treated HeLa
cells with 30 ng/mL of BMP7 for 15 hours each time on every second
day for 2 weeks. The pulsatile treatments of cultured HeLa cells with
BMP7 resulted in a sustained telomerase inhibition and significant
shortening of telomeres as measured by quantitative fluorescence
in situ hybridization (Q-FISH), using a specific telomeric DNA probe
in cell metaphase spreads. As shown in Fig. 2A, BMP7 treatments of
cultured HeLa cells caused a marked shift of the telomere
fluorescence peak compared with the control. The size of telomeres
in the control cells was ranged with a major peak of >100
frequencies between f300 and f1,200 fluorescence unit. In

contrast, the telomeres in the BMP7-treated cells were shown as
a major peak with a relatively narrow range exhibiting between
100 and 1,100 fluorescence unit. The highest frequency of telomere
fluorescence in control cells occurred at 800 to 900 fluorescence
units, whereas the highest frequency of telomere fluorescence in
BMP7-treated cells occurred at 500 to 600 fluorescence units
showing significantly shortened telomeres compared with the
control (Fig. 2A). Analyzing the mean telomere length in control
and BMP7-treated cells showed that the mean telomere length in
the BMP7-treated group could be f25% shorter than that in the
controls (Fig. 2B). The fluorescence micrographs in Fig. 2C showed
typical images of telomere fluorescence (yellow dots) in different
sizes at the ends of chromosomes (blue) between control (left)
and BMP7-treated (right) HeLa cells.
BMP7 induces cancer cell death by a mechanism largely
dependent on hTERT gene repression. To determine the
functional consequence of BMP7-induced telomerase inhibition
and telomere shortening, we examined the changes in cell number
and apoptotic death in the cell cultures treated with or without
different cytokines over a time course of several days. As shown in
Fig. 3A, whereas the cells underwent population doubling in the
control group, a single-dose treatment of HeLa cells with BMP7
(10 ng/mL) resulted in a marked reduction of total cell number.
The reduction of cell number in the cell cultures treated with BMP7

was f50% on each day of the controls treated with diluent, BMP2,
BMP4, BMP5, or BMP6, showing a complete arrest of cell
population doubling by the presence of BMP7 (Fig. 3A). Treatment
of the cells with different concentrations of BMP7 for 24 hours
showed a concentration-dependent reduction of cell numbers
(data not shown). To determine if BMP7 induces cancer cell
apoptosis, we examined HeLa treated with or without BMP7 for the
apoptotic markers of Annexin V and PI staining by FACS. As shown
in Fig. 3B, a single dose of BMP7 treatment resulted in a
significantly increase in HeLa cell apoptosis compared with
controls (7% versus 17%).
To investigate if BMP7-induced cell death is a consequence of
hTERT gene repression and telomerase inhibition, we analyzed the
effect of hTERT gene expression on BMP7-induced cell death in
HeLa cell cultures. Underexpression of hTERT with hTERT shRNA
for 48 hours mimicked the cell killing effect of BMP7 (Fig. 3B),
whereas overexpression of hTERT for 24 hours before BMP7
treatment inhibited subsequent BMP7-induced cell death (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that the proapoptotic effect of BMP7 is mediated in a
significant part by hTERT repression. To further attest the role of
hTERT in the BMP7-induced cell death, we transfected HeLa cells
with GFP-hTERT, GFP-hTERT shRNA, or GFP-only gene expression
plasmids, then isolated the GFP-positive transformants by FACS
and treated the cells with BMP7 (10 ng/mL) for 24 hours. In these

or without 30 ng/mL of BMP7, BMP6, BMP5, BMP4, or BMP2 for different periods of time as indicated. Cell numbers were counted in 20 AL at each time when

experiments. D, effects of BMP7 in telomerase-negative cell lines. GM847, Saos2, and HeLa cells were incubated in duplicate with different concentrations of BMP7

homogenously transfected cell cultures, we found that the
expression of GFP-hTERT significantly decreased the levels of cell
death induced by BMP7 ( from 10-22% versus from 10-17%; Fig. 3C),
corroborating that hTERT repression is required to a significant
degree in BMP7-induced cell death. Consistently, down-regulation
of hTERT with GFP-hTERT shRNA increased cell death above basal
levels (Fig. 3C). Consistent with a significant role of telomerase
inhibition in mediating BMP7-induced apoptosis, BMP7 did not
induce significant cell death in the telomerase-negative GM847 and
Saos2 cell cultures (Fig. 3D). Verification of BMP7 receptors by
Western blotting with specific antibodies confirmed the presence
of both BMPR1A and BMPR2 receptors in Saos2 and HeLa cell
lines, although BMPR1A was not detectable in GM847 cells
(data not shown).
BMP7 inhibits tumor growth with hTERT gene repression
and telomere shortening in mouse xenograft tumors. To
investigate if BMP7 inhibits tumor growth, we examined the effect
of BMP7 on tumor cell anchorage–independent growth in soft agar
assays. As shown in Fig. 4A (left), numerous tumor colonies grew
from the HeLa cell suspension under basal conditions. In the
presence of BMP7, however, there was a dramatic inhibition of
tumor colony formation and growth, resulting in <15% colonies of

the control (Fig. 4A). The inhibition was concentration dependent,
with the IC50 and maximal inhibition concentrations being 4 and
20 ng/mL, respectively (Fig. 4A, right). To attest the effect of BMP7
on tumor growth in vivo, we exploited the xenograft tumor model
in immune-deficient nude mice and carried out intratumor
injection of different concentrations of BMP7 on every second
day for 2 weeks. BMP7 markedly inhibited tumor growth compared
with the controls (Fig. 4B). Significant tumor growth inhibition was
observed after the first one or two injections of 10 ng/mL of BMP7,
with maximal inhibition observed after three injections (Fig. 4B).
Inhibition was concentration dependent, with the IC50 being
f10 ng/mL and maximal inhibitory concentration of 30 ng/mL of
BMP7 (Fig. 4C). The effective concentrations were comparable with
that inducing telomerase inhibition (Fig. 1A) and inhibiting
thymidine incorporation in human myeloma cells (12). In 2 weeks
of the treatment, BMP7 induced a maximal tumor growth inhibition
by f75% of the controls (Fig. 4C), whereas no significant inhibitory
effect was observed on the tumors receiving BMP2, BMP4, BMP5, or
BMP6 under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 4B).
To determine the intermediate role of hTERT gene repression in
the BMP7-induced tumor growth inhibition, we carried out
underexpression and overexpression of hTERT in the xenograft

BMP7 Induces Telomere Shortening in Cervical Tumors

tumors and determined the effect of BMP7 in different backgrounds of hTERT gene expression on tumor growth. Significant
inhibitory effect on tumor growth was observed in the animals
treated by intratumor injection of the hTERT shRNA expression
plasmid (Fig. 4D). Overexpression of wild-type hTERT has no
significant effect on tumor growth in the cohort receiving
intratumor injection of hTERT expression plasmid. However,
overexpression of hTERT significantly compromised the BMP7induced inhibition of tumor growth, reversing tumor growth
inhibition from 25% back to 70% to 80% of the control after
2 weeks of treatments (Fig. 4D). Examinations of telomerase
activity in the tumors treated with or without BMP7 showed that
telomerase activity was almost completely inhibited in the tumor
tissues treated with BMP7 for 2 weeks, in contrast to the controls
and other groups receiving treatments with BMP2, BMP4, BMP5, or
BMP6 (Fig. 5A and B). To determine altered gene expressions, we
found that BMP7 treatment rendered a marked inhibition of the
endogenous hTERT gene expression after 2 weeks of treatment
(Fig. 5C and D). In addition, BMP7 treatment also induced a
significant inhibition of the oncogene c-myc gene expression
(Fig. 5C and D), suggesting that BMP7 induces the repression of the
hTERT gene through a transcription-dependent mechanism
involving c-myc gene repression (30, 33). Furthermore, corresponding with a BMP7-triggerd deregulation of telomeres and its associated DNA damage response, we observed significant increases in
the levels of p53 and p16 tumor suppressors in the tumors treated
with BMP7 (Fig. 5C and D). The increases of p53 and p16 were
significant compared with the control, reflecting an activation of
the cell cycle checkpoints and arrest of the cell cycle (Fig. 5D).
Examination of telomeres in the tumor tissues showed that the
average telomere length in the tumors treated with BMP7 for

2 weeks was significantly shorter than that in the controls (Fig. 6A
and B). The shortening of telomeres induced by the pulsatile
treatment with BMP7 for 2 weeks was 25% to 30% of the controls.
On the contrary, overexpression of hTERT resulted in lengthened
telomeres to f130% of the control (Fig. 6A and B) in association
with a significant reversal of BMP7-induced tumor growth arrest
(Fig. 4D). Consistent with a functional consequence of telomere
shortening, we observed a significant decrease of cell proliferation
as indicated by Ki67 staining in BMP7-treated tumors. As shown in
Fig. 6C and D, BMP7 elicited an inhibition of cell proliferation by
f60% as estimated in Ki67 staining on tumor tissue sections.
These in vivo findings from the xenograft tumors mirrored the
findings from cell culture studies, demonstrating that BMP7
triggered an intracellular signaling pathway leading to repressed
gene expressions of c-myc and hTERT, increased gene expressions
of cell cycle checkpoints, inhibition of telomerase activity,
shortening of telomeres, and cancer cell apoptosis.

Discussion
The maintenance of telomeres is critical for cancer cell
proliferation particularly as telomeres are already very short in
cancer cells (21, 24). Inhibition of telomere maintenance offers an
important mechanism to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. In this
study, we show that the cytokine BMP7 triggers an inhibition of
telomere maintenance and cervical cancer cell growth arrest
in vitro and in tumor xenografts. A single application of
recombinant BMP7 produces a significant inhibition of telomerase
activity critical in telomere maintenance in cultured cervical
cancer HeLa cells. Continuous applications of BMP7 on every
second day for 2 weeks in HeLa cell cultures or xenograft tumors

result in a sustained depression of telomerase activity and
shortening of telomeres. Consistently, BMP7 induces a gene
expression pattern of decreased hTERT and c-myc, and increased
p16 and p53. Furthermore, BMP7 induces inhibition of cancer cell
anchorage–independent growth in soft agar and xenograft tumor
growth. These findings suggest that telomere homeostasis
is subject to regulation by extracellular cytokines in which
BMP7 plays a significant role in eliciting a negative regulation of
telomere maintenance and cell proliferative capacity in cancer.
Furthermore, our data also suggest that BMP7 has a potential
utility in anticancer effect by targeting cancer cell telomere
maintenance.
The specificity of BMP7-induced inhibition of telomerase
activity, telomere maintenance and cancer cell proliferation was
shown by testing different BMPs. The dose-dependent effect of
BMP7, with an effective concentration within a physiologically
relevant range (11, 38, 39), supports a specific effect of BMP7
mediated by BMP7 receptors on tumor cell surface. Time course
studies showing that BMP7 inhibition of telomerase activity occurs
in 24 hours of treatment further suggest that BMP7 inhibits
telomerase activity by modifying specific programs of gene
expression in the tumor cells. We identify that the effect of
BMP7 on cancer cell apoptosis is mediated by a mechanism
involving repression of the hTERT gene and inhibition of
telomerase activity. Underexpression of hTERT mimics the cell
killing effect of BMP7, whereas overexpression of hTERT
significantly inhibits the BMP7-induced cell death. Although future
studies are required to investigate the mechanisms underlying
BMP7-induced hTERT gene repression and telomere shortening,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

the findings that c-myc is down-regulated in association with
hTERT down-regulation suggest that repression of c-myc contributes to the repression of the hTERT gene induced by BMP7.
Previous studies show that BMP7 induces apoptosis of myeloma
cells (12) and prostate cancer cells (13, 18). Consistently, our studies
show that BMP7 also induces cervical cancer cell apoptosis. In
addition, we show for the first time that BMP7 inhibits cervical
tumor growth in mice. Our in vivo findings in cervical cancer cells
are consistent with recent studies showing BMP7 antitumor effect
in breast cancer (19) and prostate cancer (19). Furthermore, we have
found that BMP7 inhibits telomerase activity and induces telomere
shortening as a fundamental mechanism in BMP7-induced cell
death. In line with the recent findings that BMP7 maintains
epithelial cell phenotypes, and inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal
transition and cancer cell metastasis (16, 17, 19), our data suggest
that BMP7 serves a function to inhibit cancer cell proliferation by
inducing intracellular signaling to counteract mitogenic stimulation
of telomerase activity by factors such as c-myc. Endogenous BMP7
produced in cancer cells may thus be a protective mechanism
against oncogenic development, and reinforcement with exogenous
recombinant BMP7 produces an imbalance in favor of BMP7
predominance by counterbalancing the actions of oncogenic
growth factors and cytokines in extracellular microenvironment
of cancer. BMP7-induced inhibition of telomerase activity and
shortening of telomeres may therefore represent a powerful
mechanism to intercept the process of immortalization of
neoplastic cells that use telomerase to maintain telomeres. To the
cancer cells that adopt alternative mechanisms to maintain
telomeres, BMP7 seems ineffective as we show that BMP7 does

not induce significant cell death of Saos2 cells that express BMP7
receptors and are telomerase negative. Because BMP7 inhibition of
prostate cancer cell proliferation is also dependent on the subtypes
of derived cell lines (18), it would be interesting to determine if cells
that respond differently to BMP7 without undergoing apoptosis
assume a different mechanism to stabilize telomeres during
continuous proliferation. However, our findings that constant
presence of high levels of BMP7 results in sustained telomerase
inhibition and telomere shortening illustrate a novel model in
cytokine therapeutic intervention of cancer development through
targeting telomerase maintenance of telomeres.
It is currently thought that deregulation of telomeres instigates
rapid cell death via mechanisms including telomere decapping and
DNA damage response. Our observation that BMP7 induces
telomerase inhibition and telomere shortening in association with
imminent cancer cell death are consistent with the recent findings
that inhibition of telomerase induces a rapid cancer cell death (40,
41). Our findings that BMP7 induces hTERT repression–dependent
inhibition on tumor growth are also consistent with recent reports
that inhibition of telomerase induces telomere shortening and
tumor growth arrest (42, 43). In support of telomeric DNA damage
response, we show that BMP7 induces increased p16 and p53 cell
cycle checkpoint activities. Critical in tumor cell aging and death
(44, 45), increased p16 and p53 activities have previously been
shown to be involved in coupling telomere deregulation with cell
senescent and apoptotic response (46, 47). Thus, BMP7-induced

cancer cell death may be prompted by a series of interchanges
including telomerase inhibition, telomere shortening, telomereassociated DNA damage responses, and subsequent cell senescence
and apoptosis (48–50). In summary, our data show a novel
mechanism of BMP7-negative regulation of telomere maintenance
and cell proliferation in cancer by a mechanism of hTERT gene
repression and telomerase inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Our data
suggest that telomeres undergo continuous remodeling, which can
be reprogramming by defined combinations of extracellular factors,
with BMP7 serving as a major negative regulator. Further studies
should unveil a complete picture of extracellular regulation of
telomere remodeling by various factors in cancer and other highly
proliferative cells such as stem cells.
