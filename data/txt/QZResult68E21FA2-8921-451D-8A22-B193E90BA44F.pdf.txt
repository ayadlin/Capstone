ABSTRACT
Here we demonstrated that sepantronium bromide (YM155), a survivin
suppressant, inhibited esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) growth in mice
bearing human ESCC xenografts without affecting body weight. In cell culture,
YM155 decreased survivin levels and caused PARP-1 activation, poly-ADP polymer
formation, and AIF translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Genetic knockdown
of PARP-1 or AIF abrogated YM155-induced parthanatos cell death. Furthermore,
FOS, JUN and c-MYC gene transcription, which is stimulated by activated PARP-1,
was increased following YM155 treatment. Our data demonstrate that YM155 did
not trigger apoptosis, but induced parthanatos, a cell death dependent on PARP-1
hyper-activation, and support clinical development of YM155 in ESCC.

near-haploid human cell line KBM7, Kasap and colleagues
demonstrated that YM155 is a general DNA intercalator
that causes cytotoxicity via DNA damage and is dependent
on the expression of the solute carrier gene SLC35F2[10].
There are additional factors affecting the cellular uptake
of YM155, such as the human organic cation transporter 1
(OCT1/SLC22A1) in primary human hepatocytes.
Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) ranks
as the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death
in China, with approximately 50% of total ESCC cases in
the world occur in China [11, 12]. Most ESCC patients in
China were diagnosed with advanced stages of the disease,
which respond poorly to chemotherapy. Concurrent
chemo/radiotherapy is currently the standard of care in
the nonsurgical management of advanced esophageal
cancer [13]. Cisplatin (cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum
(II), CDDP), combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is a
standard regimen that has been commonly used to treat
ESCC clinically. A recent genome-wide association study
(GWAS) searching for genetic variants associated with

INTRODUCTION
Survivin is overexpressed in most human cancers,
including lung, breast, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers
[1–4]. YM155, a small-molecule transcriptional repressor
of survivin, selected through high-throughput screening
with a luciferase assay using a survivin promoter, is
currently in phase II clinical trials [5]. Several malignant
cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic
breast cancer, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
were clinically evaluated with YM155 alone and as part
of combination treatments (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).
YM155 alone or in combination decreases tumor growth,
induces apoptosis, sensitizes resistant cells to apoptosis,
and prolongs survival of tumor-bearing mice [6–8].
Previous data have demonstrated that YM155 mediates
survivin suppression via directly binding and disrupting
the interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3/NF110
transcription factor complex [9]. Recently, using a
genome-wide insertional mutagenesis approach in the

length of survival with ESCC identified the upregulation
of a member of the 39A family of solute carrier proteins
(SLC39A6) [14].
Here, we examined the expression of survivin and
SLC35F2, responsible for YM155 uptake, in multiple
esophageal cell lines, testing the antitumor activity of
relevant YM155 concentrations against ESCC both
in vitro and in vivo. In esophageal cancer cells, YM155
caused non-apoptotic cell death, a PARP-mediated cell
death (parthanatos). We also investigated the molecular
mechanism of PARP-mediated parthanatos. YM155
killed esophageal cancer cells by causing DNA damage
and the hyper-activation of PARP-1 and the translocation
of AIF, leading to PARP-1-dependent cell death. Genetic
knockdown of PARP-1 or AIF abrogated YM155-induced
parthanatos cell death, suggesting that PARP-1 and AIF
were indispensable for YM155-mediated parthanatos
induction. YM155 also reduced esophageal tumor growth
and tumor weight in xenograft animal models without
affecting mouse body weight. These data emphasize the
significance of PARP-dependent parthanatos induction by
YM155 and should encourage clinical trials in ESCC.

determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A and 2B). As
shown in Fig. 2A and 2B, 12 h of exposure to YM155
changed the cell-cycle phase distribution of KYSE410
and KYSE150. Significantly increased proportions of
cells in S phase were detected in both KYSE410 and
KYSE150 after YM155 treatment for 12 hours. However,
the proportion of cells in G1 phase markedly decreased
after YM155 treatment. Taken together, these data suggest
that both KYSE410 and KYSE150 esophageal cancer cell
lines are sensitive in response to YM155 treatment.

YM155 causes non-apoptotic cell death in
esophageal cancer cells
To test whether the reduced cell viability of
esophageal cancer cell lines following YM155 treatment is
associated with apoptosis, both KYSE410 and KYSE150
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin
V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). As shown in Fig. 2C,
YM155 treatment for 24 h increased the fraction of
cells with PI and annexin V double-positive staining in
KYSE410 and KYSE150 cell lines. To further investigate
whether YM155 treatment induces cell death via apoptosis,
mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS and the active
formation of caspases was examined by flow cytometry
and western blot analysis. The mitochondrial membrane
potential was not decreased after 12 h of YM155 treatment
(Fig. 3A), and only a small increase in ROS was detected
after 12 h of YM155 treatment in KYSE410 and KYSE510
cells (Fig. 3B). Treatment with YM155 for 12 or 24 h did
not affect the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The
levels of survivin and XIAP, an anti-apoptotic marker,
were also measured after YM155 treatment. Survivin
expression decreased after YM155 treatment in KYSE150
cells but not KYSE410 cells, whereas XIAP protein levels
greatly decreased in both cell lines (Fig. 2D). Upon further
analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
KYSE410 cells treated with YM155 for 24 h displayed
swollen mitochondria and discontinuous cytoplasmic
membranes but lacked typical apoptotic features such
as condensed nuclei, plasma membrane blebbing and
apoptotic bodies (Fig. 5E). Collectively, these results
indicate that YM155 predominantly induced a nonapoptotic, caspase-independent form of cell death in
KYSE410 and KYSE150 cells.
Although YM155 has been reported to induce
caspase activation [23], the active cleavage of caspases
was not detected in this study. It was not known whether
YM155 treatment induces other factors that trigger cell
death. Recent data have shown that YM155 induces
autophagy-dependent cell death in salivary adenoid
cystic carcinoma [24]. Autophagy markers, including
LC3I, LC3II, Beclin and BNIP3, were measured by
western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. S2, YM155
treatment did not produce time-dependent increases in
LC3I, LC3II, Beclin and BNIP3 levels in KYSE410

RESULTS
YM155 inhibits growth of esophageal cancer
cell lines
Previous work revealed that the expression level
of the transporter SLC35F2 is associated with sensitivity
to the drug YM155 [22]. To assess the expression of
SLC35F2 and survivin, a panel of eight ESCC cell lines
was constructed for evaluation via western blot analysis.
The molecular formula of Sepantronium bromide
(YM155) is shown in Fig. 1A. It shows that the expression
levels of SLC35F2 and survivin vary across cell lines in
Fig. 1B, with KYSE140, KYSE150, KYSE170, KYSE410
and WHCO1 showing relatively high expression of
SLC35F2 and survivin and KYSKE30, KYSE180 and
KYSE510 showing relatively low expression levels
of SLC35F2. Based on the cell panel data, the cell
lines KYSE410 and KYSE150 were chosen for further
investigation of the efficacy of YM155. Both KYSE150,
which has high survivin expression, and KYESE410,
which has more modest expression, have high SLC35F2
expression. The MEF cell line was used as a control.
To assess the efficacy of YM155, both cell lines were
treated with different concentrations of YM155 for 24
or 48 h. Dose-response experiments (Fig. 1C) and Timedependent cure (Fig. S1) demonstrate that both cell lines
were exquisitely sensitive to YM155, whereas MEF cells
showed no response to YM155 at concentrations below
100 nM. We also found that YM155 markedly suppressed
colony formation compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1E).
To define the response to YM155, the cell-cycle
profiles of cells treated with YM155 for 12 h were

To explore whether the mTOR pathway changed, we
examined mTOR pathway-associated proteins including
mTOR, AKT, S6, and ERK. The expression levels of
mTOR, and the phosphorylation of AKT, S6, 4-EBP and
ERK decreased after treatment with YM155 in KYSE410
but not KYSE150 cells, indicating that the decrease in the
mTOR pathway may be associated with YM155-induced
cell death (Fig. 4D).

generates DNA damage and mediates DNA damage

KYSE410 and KYSE150 cells using immunofluorescence

of γH2AX after 12 h of YM155 treatment in both
KYSE410 and KYSE150 cell lines. A significant induction
of γH2AX expression was detected in both cell lines by
western blot analysis at the 12- and 24-h time points,
indicating the presence of DNA double-strand breaks.

and cleaved PARP. As shown in Fig. 3D, treatment YM155

form of cell death termed “parthanatos,” which is
morphologically characterized by poly-ADP formation,
the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from
the mitochondria, nuclear translocation of AIF and
membrane rupture [27–29]. We have previously shown
that full-length PARP-1 protein levels in KYSE410 cells
greatly increased after YM155 treatment for 12 and 24 h.

To determine whether PARP1 was extensively activated
after YM155 treatment in KYSE410 cells, we analyzed the
expression of PARP1 and PAR by immunofluorescence
and western blot analysis after YM155 treatment.
As shown in Fig. 4A, compared with untreated cells,
YM155 treatment induced the accumulation of PARP1
in the nuclei. To further analyze PARP1 activation, total

cytosolic fractions were isolated and tested for expression
of PARP1 and PAR by western blot analysis. Significant
accumulation of PARP-1 and PAR was observed in the
nuclear fraction of KYSE410 cells after treatment with
YM155 for 12 or 24 h (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescence and
western blot assays using a specific anti-PAR antibody
confirmed that Poly-ADP is formed in the cytoplasm and
nuclei of KYSE410 cells, indicating that PARP is activated
in the nuclei after treatment (Fig. 4C).
PARP activation results in the release of AIF from
mitochondria and occurs directly through PAR targeting
the mitochondrial membrane, and translocation of AIF
into the nucleus plays an essential role in parthanatos
cell death [30, 31]. Therefore, to further explore the
PARP1-AIF pathway, we also assessed AIF release and
translocation after treatment with YM155 for 12 and 24 h
using immunofluorescence and western blot analysis.
Following treatment with YM155, immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence results indicated that endogenous
AIF translocated into the nucleus in a time-dependent
manner, leading to parthanatos cell death in KYSE410
cells (Fig. 4B and Fig. S3). To investigate the roles of
PARP1 and AIF in YM155-induced parthanatos cell death,
siRNA targeting PARP-1 and AIF were used to knock
down PARP-1 and AIF expression in KYSE410 cells.
After siRNA transfection, knockdown of PARP-1 and AIF
was analyzed by western blotting. Compared to the control
group, PARP-1 and AIF protein expression were found to
decrease at 24 h after siRNA transfection in KYSE410
cells (Fig. 4E and 4F). The scramble control group and
targeted siRNAs group of KYSE410 cells were treated
with YM155 for 24 h, and cell survival was analyzed with
the CCK-8 viability assay. As shown in Fig. 4G and 4F,
the effect of YM155 was inhibited by PARP-1 or AIF
knockdown using siRNA transfection in KYSE410 cells.
Collectively, these data indicate that PARP-1 and AIF play
important roles in PARP-1-mediated parthanatos cell death
after YM155 treatment in KYSE410 cells.

chips of untreated and YM155-treated cells. Within the
upregulated genes, similar annotation terms are grouped
into clusters using DAVID functional annotation clustering
to measure the relationships between the annotation terms
and their co-association with the genes [20]. It is important
to note that the upregulated genes were predominantly
involved in the regulation of programmed cell death,
the positive regulation of biosynthetic processes and
the negative regulation of gene expression (Fig. 5C).
Using the online database resource Search Tool for the
Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING), we evaluated
the interactions between the upregulated genes following
YM155 treatment in KYSE410 cells [21]. As shown
in Fig. 5B, we identified certain vital core genes from
STRING, including FOS, JUN, c-MYC, and CCNE,
which are regulated by activated PARP [32, 33]. Canonical
biological process of genes up-regulated in KYSE410 is
available in Supplementary Tables 2. To better understand
how KYSE410 cells execute apoptosis or other cell death
after YM155 treatment, real-time PCR was conducted
on genes associated with programmed cell death,
such as FOS, JUN, c-MYC, CCNE, CCND, NOXA,
MLKL, BIRC5, CYCS, APAF1, CASP9, SLC30A2
and HSPA1A. The mRNA levels of FOS, JUN, c-MYC,
SLC30A2, CCNE, and NOXA were significantly elevated
in KYSE410 cells after treatment with YM155 for 6 h.
Furthermore, the mRNA levels of MLKL, BIRC5, CYCS,
APAF1, CASP9 and HSPA1A, which are associated with
apoptosis and necrosis, remained unchanged or slightly
decreased in the YM155-treated KYSE410 cells (Fig. 5D).
Therefore, transcript analysis demonstrates that YM155
treatment in KYSE410 cells facilitates the transcription
of active PARP-regulated genes such as FOS, JUN, and
c-MYC but not of apoptotic or necrotic genes.

In vivo efficacy of YM155 on esophageal cancer
cell lines
Having shown that YM155 treatment induces PARP1-dependent parthanatos cell death in esophageal cancer
cells in vitro, we next investigated the efficacy of YM155
in inhibiting KYSE410 and KYSE150 tumor growth in
a mouse xenograft model of esophageal cancer. Mice
bearing KYSE410 or KYSE150 tumors were inoculated
for 10 days by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) with 5 mg/
kg YM155 respectively, in the YM155 treatment group
(n = 5 for KYSE410 and KYSE150) or with 0.9% normal
saline for the controls (n = 5 for KYSE410 and KYSE150).
As shown in Fig. 6A, the average tumor burden at the
beginning of the treatment was not significantly different
between the YM155-treated and control groups. YM155
treatment resulted in significant antitumor activity and
reduced the growth of KYSE410 or KYSE150 xenograft
tumors compared with the untreated group (Fig. S4A).
We observed that there was no obvious toxicity in the
various groups in that the mean body weight was similar
in all groups (Fig. 6B and Fig. S4B). There was a 66.3%

Gene expression changes in YM155-treated
KYSE410 cells
To further investigate the mechanism of YM155induced PARP-mediated parthanatos cell death in
KYSE410 cells, Affymetrix Human Genome U133
plus 2.0 arrays were used to analyze mRNA changes
in YM155-treated and untreated KYSE410 cells. Each
experiment included two biological replicates. The
array data were analyzed using Significance Analysis of
Microarrays (SAM 3.02) software. The cutoff criteria for
significantly differentially expressed genes were set to a
ratio of >2-fold difference in expression and an adjusted
P value of < 0.05. In the YM155-treated group, a total
of 549 genes fulfilled these stringent cutoff criteria;
221 genes were upregulated, whereas 328 genes were
downregulated. Fig. 5A shows a heatmap represented of
different genes expression generated from Affymetrix

To assess the biological effects of YM155-based

were examined for markers of PARP-1, tumor cell
proliferation (Ki67), and survivin. Changes in these
markers reflected antitumor activity in response to YM155.
More specifically, significant reductions in survivin, Ki67
and PARP were observed in the KYSE410 model after
treatment with KYSE155 (Fig. 6D).

DISCUSSION
We examined the therapeutic potential of YM155
in esophageal cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Previous
studies have implicated apoptosis in YM155-induced
cytotoxicity in multiple types of cancer [23, 34, 35].
18453

The initial screen identifying YM155, using an artificial
reporter system including the survivin promoter, was
conducted in human cervical epithelia carcinoma cells
(HeLa) and Chinese hamster ovary cells [5]. YM155
efficiently repressed survivin promoter activity via
binding and disrupting proteins such as interleukin
enhancer-binding factor-3 (ILF3-p54/nrb complex) and
SP1 [5, 9, 36, 37]. In this study, we found that YM155
partly reduced survivin expression in KYSE150 but not
KYSE410 cells. YM155 induced DNA damage response
including γH2AX and PARP-1 hyper-activation. Our
results are consistent with Gloro and Kasap’s reports that
YM155 induced DNA damage and cell death [10, 38].
For the first time, YM155-induced PARP-1-dependent
parthanatos cell death has been observed in esophageal
cancer cells, and the underlying cytotoxic mechanism is
tightly linked to PARP-1 hyper-activation leading to PAR
formation and AIF translocation. Thus, YM155 is a novel
inducer of PARP-1-dependent parthanatos cell death and
has potential as an effective esophageal cancer treatment.
Cell death can be enacted through various
mechanisms including apoptosis, necrosis, and
autophagy. In previous studies, we demonstrated that
apoptotic, necrotic and autophagic cell death occurs
after anticancer drug treatment in esophageal cancer
cells [16–18]. Although these three distinct modes of
cell death were considered to share common biochemical
features for death execution, recent advances have
revealed parthanatos cell death, a new variant occurring
in many neurodegenerative disorders, which is reported
to be PARP-1-dependent and caspase-independent
[29, 31, 39, 40]. PARP-1 takes part in genomic repair
under physiological condition and is considered a
“genome guardian” [41, 42]. Mild DNA damage induces
PARP-1 activation to repair the damaged DNA, whereas
excessive activation of PARP-1 leads to a unique form of
cell death termed parthanatos that is largely mediated via
accumulation of poly-ADP polymers and the translocation
of AIF from the mitochondria [40, 43–45]. In this study,
we found that YM155 selectively induces parthanatos cell
death in KYSE410 and KSYE150 cells. This conclusion
is based on the following observations in KYSE410 and
KYSE150 cells undergoing YM155-induced cell death:
(i) little nuclear fragmentation or caspase cleavage;
(ii) the release of LDH, PARP-1 hyper-activation, polyADP polymer formation and translocation of AIF and
(iii) the visualization of disrupted cytoplasmic membranes
and cellular organ swelling using TEM. Furthermore,
our data show that YM155 led to a significant timedependent accumulation of full-length PARP after YM155
treatment. Poly-ADP polymer formation was measured
in the cytosol and the nucleus of KYSE410 cells after
YM155 treatment, using a specific anti-PAR antibody
for immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. In
addition, knockdown of PARP1 using siRNA interference

parthanatos cell death in KYSE410 cells. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that AIF suppression by siRNA decreases
the antitumor activity of YM155 in KYSE410 cells.
Collectively, these results suggest that YM155-mediated
PARP-1 hyper-activation enhances the antitumor effect
through the formation of poly-ADP polymers as well as
the translocation of AIF, ultimately leading to parthanatos
cell death. Previous results suggested that parthanatos cell
death is a result of intracellular energy depletion, resulting
from excess nicotine amide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
and ATP consumption [28, 46]. Consumption of NAD+ as
a PARP-1 substrate generates poly-ADP polymer, which
translocates to the cytosol to induce cell death via the
nuclear translocation of AIF to effect large-scale DNA
fragmentation [47, 48].
Although apoptosis is the predominant pathway
of YM155-induced cell death in cancer cells, it is
reported that autophagy-dependent cell death presents an
alternative YM155-effected pathway in salivary adenoid
cystic carcinoma [24]. The current study shows that both
apoptotic and necrotic machinery were attenuated during
YM155-induced parthanatos cell death in KYSE410 and
KYSE150 cells. Microarray analysis demonstrated that
the transcription of BIRC5, CYCS, APAF1, CASP9,
HSPA1A and MLKL, which are associated with apoptosis
and necrosis, were decreased in YM155-treated KYSE410
cells. Furthermore, autophagy-associated markers,
including LC3I, LC3II, Beclin and BNIP3 [18, 49], did
not increase in a time-dependent manner after YM155
treatment in KYSE410 cells, suggesting that YM155 did
not induce autophagy. On the contrary, our results indicate
that the mRNA levels of FOS, JUN, c-MYC and
SLC30A2 in KYSE410 cells were elevated more than
20-fold after treatment with YM155 for 6 h. Mostocotto’s
study showed that PARP-1 plays an essential role in
regulating the expression of c-MYC, c-FOS, and JUN.
Active PARP-1 enhanced several changes involved in
binding to functionally relevant sequences of the promoter,
chromatin relaxation, the exchange of transcription factors
and the accumulation of phosphoacetylated histone
H3, consequently facilitating the induction of c-MYC
[32]. Several studies have shown that PARP-1 acts as
a regulator of various transcriptional factors, such as
E2F-1, FOXO1 and FOS, and of genomic methylation
patterns [33, 50, 51]. In the present study, we observed
significantly increased transcription of c-MYC, c-FOS,
and JUN in microarray analysis and PCR validation
experiments. Based on transcription of upregulated genes,
we further confirmed the excessive activation of PARP-1
upon YM155 treatment in esophageal cancer cells.
This is the first study demonstrating that YM155
causes hyper-activation of PARP1 and induces PARP1-dependent parthanatos cell death. Previous neuronal
death studies have shown that parthanatos cell death is
a programmed necrotic demise, characteristic of ATP
consumption due to NAD+ depletion by PARP-1-mediated

PAR formation on target proteins [31, 43, 45]. Further
study is necessary to determine (i) why in esophageal
cancer, YM155 initiates PARP-1 hyperactivation-mediated
Parthanatos cell death as opposed to caspase-dependent
apoptosis; (ii) how poly-ADP in the cytosol induces a deathsignaling cascade and executes biological functions in the
PARP-1-mediated pathway and; (iii) the identity of proteins
targeted by PAR to explore the complex pathway from
nuclear to mitochondria during the process of parthanatos.
In conclusion, we report that YM155 treatment can
kill esophageal cancer cells by causing DNA damage,
PARP-1 hyper-activity, and AIF translocation leading
to PARP-1-dependent parthanatos cell death and that it
reduced tumor burden in both in vitro and in animal models
in vivo of esophageal cancer. Our preclinical results provide
a rationale for future clinical investigation of the therapeutic
efficacy of YM155 in patients with esophageal cancer.

treatment for 24 or 48 h, cell viability was assessed
with the CCK-8 assay (Dojindo, Japan), and the
absorbency value was read using a Model 680 microplate
reader (Bio-Rad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For the colony-formation assay, cells were
seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells per
well and treated with YM155 for 24 h. Cells were then
washed 3 times with PBS, and media was replaced with
fresh RPMI containing 10% FBS. After 7 days, cells were
stained with 0.25% crystal violet (AMRESCO) for 20 min.
All experiments were conducted at least 3 times.
Cell-cycle distribution was determined using a cellcycle detection reagent kit (4A Biotech, Beijing, China).
Cells were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol and incubated
at 4°C. Ethanol-fixed cells were stained with propidium
iodide (PI) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell death was
detected by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining
using apoptosis detection kits (Biosea Biotechnology,
Beijing, China), coupled with flow cytometry as described
previously [16]. For data collection, 10, 000 cells were
acquired per sample and analyzed using BD software.
Mean values were obtained from 3 independent assays.

were used to perform enrichment analysis using the
Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated
Discovery (DAVID) and the online database resource
Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes
(STRING) [20, 21].
Total RNA was isolated from the untreated and
YM155-treated KYSE410 cells, and first-strand reverse
transcription was performed using the SuperScript®
III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, USA). Primers
were designed with Primer-Blast software (http://www.ncbi

AKT, Phospho-AKT, ERK, Phospho-ERK, Phospho-S6,
4EBP1, Phospho-4EBP1, LC3, Beclin, Apoptosisinducing factor (AIF), SLC35F2, PAR, PARP and β-actin.

Immunofluorescent staining
Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 min after YM155 treatment,
rinsed 3 times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100, and blocked for 30 min with PBS containing 2%
BSA. The cells on coverslips were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with the indicated primary antibodies
and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min
with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.
Fluorescence images were captured with a Nikon
ECLIPSE 80i microscope [18].

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection
For PARP-1 and AIF knockdown, KYSE410
cells grown in a 6-well plate were transfected with
PARP-1 and AIF siRNA using Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instruction [17]. The siRNAs targeting AIF were
siRNA-1:
5′-CCACCUUCUUUCUAUGUCUTT-3′,
siRNA-2:
5′-GGGCACAGAAGUGAUUCAATT-3′,
and siRNA-3: 5′-CUGCAUGCUUCUACGAUAUTT-3′,
and the siRNAs targeting PARP-1 were siRNA-1:
5′-GAGACCC AAUAGGCUUAAUTT-3′, siRNA-2:
5′-GAGCACUUCAUGAAAUUAUTT-3′, and siRNA-3:
5′-GAGGAAGGUAUCAACAAAUTT-3′. Nonspecific
small interfering RNA (scramble, SCR) oligonucleotides
were synthesized at GeneChem Inc., dissolved in PBS,
and diluted with culture medium.

Transmission electron microscopy
Cells grown in 10-cm dishes were treated with
YM155 for 24 h, fixed for 2 h with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), further fixed
in osmium tetroxide solution for 1 h, and subjected to
electron microscopy analysis with a JEM-2100 electron
microscope (JEOL, Japan).

In vivo xenograft assay
Animal experiments were carried out as previously
described [17]. Briefly, 5 × 106 KYSE410 or KYSE150
cells were suspended in 100 μl PBS and injected
subcutaneously into the right flanks of female nude mice
(n = 10). When a tumor was detectable (approximately
14 days after subcutaneous injection), mice were randomly
assigned to two groups, receiving either YM155 or 0.9%
saline. The YM155 treatment group was given continual
intraperitoneal injections for 10 days. YM155 was
dissolved in PBS to a working concentration of 5 mg/kg.
To monitor tumor growth, the tumor size was measured
every 2–3 days using digital calipers. Tumor volume was
calculated using the formula: 0.5 × a × b2, where a is the
length of the tumor and b is the width. All experimental
procedures using animals were previously reviewed
and approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee (IACUC) at the Cancer Hospital of Chinese
Academy of Medical Science.

Microarray and real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from untreated and
YM155-treated KYSE410 cells using an RNeasy® mini
kit (Qiagen). The quality of the total RNA was determined
using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-2000; Thermo
Fisher Scientific). RNA with an A260/A280 absorbance
ratio ranging from 1.8 to 2.0 was used for cDNA synthesis.
Gene expression profiles were analyzed on a GeneChip®
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA), which contains 54, 000 probe sets representing
approximately 47, 000 genes. The signal intensity of the
gene expression was analyzed to generate CEL files using
the default setting of Affymetrix® GeneChip® Command
Console® 3.2 (AGCC) Software. The Affymetrix
Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS5) and the Robust Multi-array
Average (RMA) algorithm were used for the expression
summary and signal calculation of the GeneChip® Human
Genome U133 2.0 data [19], respectively. Differentially
