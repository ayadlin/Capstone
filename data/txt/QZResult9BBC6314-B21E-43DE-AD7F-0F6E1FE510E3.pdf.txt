ntravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy for nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer is the single most effective therapy
available today, other than extirpative surgery. Since its ﬁrst use in
humans against bladder cancer in the 1970s, most urologists have
used the scheme developed by Morales et al,1 which consisted of
6 weekly instillations of BCG in the bladder. What is not generally
well known is that this schedule was decided based on convenience
of using the then available strain of BCG manufactured by the Institute Armand Frappier and was available as a package of 6 separate
vials.2 It is remarkable indeed that subsequent studies have borne
out the relevance of this induction schedule and a 6-week induction
is now considered to be the gold standard ‘induction course.’
Immunological studies have also shown, however, that a single 6week induction course of BCG is not sufﬁcient—in the majority of
patients in North America—to induce a long-lasting delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It was recognized early on that repeat exposure
to BCG is required. In order to ﬁnd the ‘optimal’ schedule of such
repeated exposure, different maintenance schedules have been
proposed including repeated 6-week cycles every 6 months,3 1
instillation every 3 months,4 or monthly maintenance.5 In these
prospective randomized trials (where a single 6-week course of
induction served as the control group), maintenance therapy was
found to have no signiﬁcant effect on recurrence or progression.
Thus, the erroneous belief exists that maintenance BCG is not beneﬁcial and a single 6-week induction course is ‘enough.’
A landmark study, which did show a beneﬁt of maintenance
therapy, was the prospective study from the Southwest Oncology
Group (SWOG) led by Donald Lamm.6 This study included 550
patients who were randomized to a weekly BCG induction for
6 weeks plus (or minus) 3 weekly instillations at the third and sixth
month, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years. Estimated median recurrence-free survival was 35.7 months in the induction-only
arm and 76.8 months in the maintenance arm (P <.0001). Estimated
median time for worsening-free survival, deﬁned as no evidence of
progression to pathologic stage T2 disease or greater, or the use of
cystectomy, systemic chemotherapy, or radiation therapy was
111.5 months in the induction-only arm and not reached in
the maintenance arm (P ¼.04). The overall 5-year survival was 78% in

the induction-only arm and 83% in the maintenance
arm. This protocol (also known as the ‘SWOG’ or
‘Lamm’ protocol) is the most commonly used dosing
schedule. It has subsequently been conﬁrmed in
meta-analyses that in order to demonstrate an effect
against progression rates patients must receive not
only induction but also maintenance therapy.7
However, maintenance BCG therapy is not without adverse effects, and even though the majority of
these side effects are localized and relatively minor, a
signiﬁcant proportion of patients are unable to complete the full prescribed course of 27 treatments
recommended by the Lamm study. This was true
even of the original SWOG report, where only 16% of
the 243 maintenance cases received all 8 scheduled
courses during 3 years. As such, it remains important
to identify the minimum number of maintenance
doses that are required to show a beneﬁt over induction alone. In this issue, Decobert et al attempt to answer the question: ‘‘How much is enough?’’ They
studied 111 patients who participated in a nonrandomized multicenter trial that was designed to evaluate
various biomarkers. As part of the trial, patients with
nonmuscle-invasive disease received BCG induction
and maintenance fashioned after the SWOG protocol.
After a median follow-up of 31 months, 57% of the
patients were free of recurrence, whereas 8.1% progressed to muscle-invasive disease or metastasis.
The authors then evaluated the outcome of BCG
therapy on patients according to the number of maintenance cycles received. Using subset analysis they
were able to show an association between the number of BCG maintenance cycles and response to BCG,
with more cycles administered associated with lower
recurrence rates, as well as a trend toward lower progression rates. In fact, 12 months following the last
BCG instillation the estimated recurrence rates were
11.5% for those receiving at least 3 maintenance BCG
cycles, 33.3% for those receiving 2 maintenance
cycles, and 53.5% for those who received induction
alone or only 1 maintenance cycle. In order to adjust
for bias they used a strict deﬁnition of recurrence,
considering only those who recurred at the second
cystoscopy (to remove the bias of incomplete transurethral resection [TUR]) and also used time after last
BCG (rather than TUR) to remove bias of BCG duration on recurrence rates. Based on their results, the
conclusion presented is that ‘‘this study suggests that
a minimum of 3 cycles of maintenance BCG is
required to signiﬁcantly reduce recurrence rate.’’
Such a conclusion appears to be in agreement
with what is generally believed about BCG therapy for
bladder cancer—that induction alone is not enough,
and that durable responses are generally not seen

675

until the second maintenance course has been administered. Although the authors state that they were
unable to demonstrate a correlation between
increased number of cycles beyond 3, it is noteworthy
that none of the 12 patients who received 5 or more
maintenance BCG cycles had a recurrence, compared
with 4 of 31 patients who developed recurrence after 3
cycles (n ¼ 1) and 4 cycles (n ¼ 3). Other confounding
factors are that patients who received BCG for 3 or
more cycles were younger by almost 8 years (it has
been suggested that older age is independently associated with decreased response to BCG), and there
were fewer patients who were cTis (9.7% vs 20.3%) and
cT1 (29% versus 34.3%) in the 3 or more versus 1 or
less groups (differences not statistically signiﬁcant).
Even with the above-mentioned caveats, the
authors are to be commended for their attempt to
answer the ever pervasive question surrounding BCG
therapy. Their data suggest that maintenance BCG of
at least 2 cycles beyond the 6-week induction course
is required to demonstrate an improvement in recurrence-free survival over induction alone (from 41%
to 67%, 12-month recurrence estimate), with increased beneﬁt seen with 3 weeks of maintenance
(recurrence-free survival was 89%, P ¼ .0003).
From the viewpoint of treatment of patients with
nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer, the take-home
message is that an increased number of maintenance BCG cycles (administered as 3 weeks of therapy at 3 months, 6 months, and then every
6 months for 3 years) is associated with lower recurrence rates. Because it is unlikely that randomized
trials of a number of courses of BCG maintenance
will be performed, it is up to us to not only encourage our patients to tolerate as many courses of
maintenance therapy as they can, but to implement
measures to allow them to tolerate these repeated
maintenance courses (e.g., dose reduction,8 periinstillation quinolone administration9). In response
to the question ‘‘Intravesical BCG for bladder cancer:
how much is enough?’’ 1 fact is clear: a single
6-week induction course of BCG is not, and repeated
3 weekly instillations at 3 months, 6 months, and
12 months should almost be considered mandatory.
