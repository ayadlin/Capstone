Abstract

Author Manuscript

One of the defining features of aggressive melanomas is their complexity. Hundreds of mutations
and an ever increasing list of changes in the transcriptome and proteome distinguish normal from
malignant melanocytic cells. Yet, despite this altered genetic background, a long-known attribute
of melanomas is a relatively low rate of mutations in the p53 gene. However, it is unclear whether
p53 is maintained in melanoma cells because it is required for their survival, or because it is
functionally disabled. More pressing from a translational perspective, is to define whether there is
a tumor cell-selective wiring of p53 that offers a window for therapeutic intervention. Here we
provide genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrating that p53 represents a liability to
melanoma cells which they thwart by assuming an oncogenic dependency on the E3 ligase
MDM2. Specifically, we used a combination of RNA interference and two structurally
independent small molecule inhibitors of the p53/MDM2 interaction to assess the relative
requirement of both proteins for the viability of normal melanocytes and a broad panel of
melanoma cell lines. We demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that MDM2 is selectively required to
blunt latent pro-senescence signals in melanoma cells. Notably, the outcome of MDM2
inactivation depends not only on the mutational status of p53, but also on its ability to signal to the
transcription factor E2F1. These data support MDM2 as a drug target in melanoma cells, and

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Malignant melanoma has long been characterized by its steadily increasing incidence and
notorious chemoresistance (Jemal et al., 2010). The molecular determinants of this
aggressive phenotype are not well understood, but they are considered to result, at least in
part, from the threshold imposed by efficient suppressive mechanisms acting already at very
early stages of tumor initiation (Bennett, 2008; Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007). Premature
senescence is one of the potent inhibitory activities that must be bypassed to allow for the
oncogenic transformation of normal melanocytes (Prieur and Peeper, 2008). In addition,
melanoma progression associates with a plethora of defects in cell cycle checkpoint controls,
survival and apoptotic pathways, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, as well as hundreds
of often disconnected changes in the transcriptome (Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007; Hoek,
2007). Separating inconsequential byproducts from “druggable” tumor drivers has been a
persistent handicap in this disease.

Given the numerous genetic and epigenetic defects of melanomas, it was logical to expect
that some of these alterations would directly affect key nodes of tumor control. One of the
first such modulators scrutinized in detail was the p53 protein (Castresana et al., 1993). The
initial interest for p53 stemmed from its well known ability to control cell cycle progression
and apoptosis (Vazquez et al., 2008). Studies from other tumor types linking p53 to cell
metabolism, differentiation, senescence, oxidative stress, autophagy, invasion or
angiogenesis (see Ref (Vousden and Prives, 2009) for a recent review), further illustrate the
multiple levels at which p53 could be halting melanoma development. In fact, various
animal models further support the concept of p53 as a suppressor of melanoma initiation and
progression (Bardeesy et al., 2001; Patton et al., 2005; Terzian et al.; Terzian et al., 2010).
Consequently, one of the most puzzling observations in this field is that the majority of
advanced human melanomas still retain wild type p53 (Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007).

Author Manuscript

Mounting evidence supports that the maintenance of p53 in melanoma is compensated for
by deactivation of upstream activators and/or downstream effectors. For example, defects in
CHK2 or p14ARF have been shown to blunt p53 activation by intrinsic and extrinsic stress
inducers (Satyamoorthy et al., 2000). Similarly, high levels of anti-apoptotic factors of the
BCL-2 family or downregulation of caspase modulators (i.e. APAF-1) can block p53dependent mitochondrial death programs (Soengas and Lowe, 2003). Nevertheless,
alterations in this pathway may not be irreversible. For example, a notable accumulation of
p53 can be observed in melanomas upon treatment with various chemical compounds,
including agents that induce DNA damage (Avery-Kiejda et al., 2008; Soengas et al., 2001;
Yang et al., 2006), inhibit MEK (Verhaegen et al., 2006), GSK3 (Smalley et al., 2007), the

proteasome (Fernandez et al., 2005), or Bcl-2 family members (Verhaegen et al., 2006). Still
this p53 induction has not yet been translated into an efficient antitumoral response in vivo.
The mechanisms controlling the levels, stability, and subcellular localization of p53 in
melanoma remain poorly understood.

Author Manuscript

p53 expression and function are modulated by multiple factors such as the murine double
minute-2 (MDM-2) gene product (Wade et al., 2010). MDM-2 can oppose p53 by shuttling
it from the nucleus to the cytosol, as well as by hindering its transactivation domain, and/or
acting as an E3-ligase to govern p53 degradation by the proteasome (Ryan et al., 2001).
MDM2 is upregulated in melanoma (Polsky and Cordon-Cardo, 2003), but whether its roles
in this tumor are limited to p53 is unclear. For example, depending on the cellular context,
MDM2 can both activate or inhibit E2F-1 (Polager and Ginsberg, 2009). In addition, RB,
CYCLIN D1, c-JUN, MYC, DAXX, Ribosomal protein S7, FOXO1, FOXO3A, FOXO4 or
CHK2 are just some examples of an increasing list of recently identified MDM2 targets (Fu
et al., 2009; Kass et al., 2009; Vousden and Prives, 2009; Zhu et al., 2009). Consequently,
MDM2 is emerging as a pleiotropic factor with multiple activities in differentiation, DNA
replication, ribosome biosynthesis, transcription or intracellular trafficking (Wade et al.,
2010).

Author Manuscript

Here we present genetic and functional analyses of the p53/MDM2 axis to answer key
pending questions in the melanoma field: (i) what is the relative contribution of p53 and
MDM2 to survival and proliferative capacity of normal melanocytes and melanoma cells;
(ii) which (if any) of the multiple roles of p53 is under the control of MDM2; (iii) whether
there is a tumor-cell selective requirement of p53/MDM2 that offers a window for
therapeutic intervention, and if the case, (iv) what are molecular requirements for an
efficient anti-melanoma activity of MDM2/p53 inhibitors.

RESULTS
Differential regulation and requirement of p53 in normal melanocytes and melanoma cells
To begin assessing the interrelationship between p53 and MDM2, both proteins were
analyzed in normal skin melanocytes, a panel of 10 melanoma cell lines expressing wild
type p53, and two cell lines (WM1366, SK-Mel-28) with mutant p53 (see Supplementary
Table I for additional information). These cells were studied in basal conditions and upon
treatment with doxorubicin (a classical p53 activator).

Author Manuscript

As shown in Fig. 1A, p53 levels were low to undetectable in the melanoma cells tested, but
could be greatly induced by doxorubicin treatment (by 20–50 fold in p53 mutant cells, and
up to 200 fold in cells expressing wild type 53). In melanocytes, however, doxorubicinmediated p53 induction was considerably less efficient (Fig. 1A and quantification in Fig.
1B). Regarding MDM2, the expression of this protein was as expected (Polsky and CordonCardo, 2003), 2 to10-fold higher levels in melanoma cells than in normal melanocytes (Fig.
1A,B). Interestingly, although the full length MDM2 90 kDa isoform declined as p53 levels
increased upon doxorubicin treatment, there was not a direct correlation between these two
proteins (Fig. 1B). These results indicated a differential regulation of the p53-MDM2 axis in
melanocytes and melanoma cells.

Next previously validated shRNAs (see Fig S1A) were used to define the relative
dependency of melanocytes and melanoma cell lines on p53. Interestingly, p53-shRNA
transduced melanoma cells maintained their morphology (Fig. S1B), proliferated at higher
rates than their uninfected or control shRNA-counterparts (p>0.05; Fig. 1C; Fig. S1C) and
showed no signs of global DNA damage (by comet assays or accumulation of
phosphorylated histone H2AX; see Fig. 1D, Fig. S1A). Therefore, these results argue against
p53 actively maintained in melanoma cells as a protective response against DNA damage or
other forms of intrinsic cellular stress, as described in other systems (Bartkova et al., 2005;
Murga et al., 2009).

Author Manuscript

As shown in Fig. S1C, melanocytes showed a transient increase in S-phase content after p53
depletion, but cell cycle progression eventually declined, with an accumulation of cells at
the G2/M phase. Comet assays were negative (not shown), but a marked increase in
multinucleated cells was observed upon p53 downregulation in melanocytes (Fig S1B). To
follow are studies to determine whether it is feasible to exploit the retention of p53 by
melanoma cells without compromising the viability of normal melanocytes.
High efficiency of melanoma cells to dampen abnormal p53 levels

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that melanoma cells retain p53 but may be particularly efficient shutting
down its induction and/or function. To test this end, normal melanocytes and two
representative melanoma cell lines were infected with bicistronic lentiviral vectors coding
for p53 and GFP (the later to monitor infection efficiencies by fluorescence microscopy, Fig.
1E). In all cells, p53 levels were induced by >50 fold by day 3 after lentiviral infection (Fig.
1F). Of note, this ectopic p53 became phosphorylated at Ser15 in the absence of external
stimuli (Fig. 1F), indicating the presence of latent stress-activating signals (Vousden and
Prives, 2009) in both normal and tumoral melanocytic cells. Interestingly high p53 levels
could be sustained in normal melanocytes, but dampened in melanoma cells (Fig. 1F). The
downregulation of p53 was associated with a transient, and more effective increase of
MDM2 in melanoma cells than in normal melanocytes (Fig. 1F).
Tumor cell-selective senescence-like features by p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors

Author Manuscript

Next, we used Nutlin-3 to block p53-MDM2 interaction (Vassilev, 2007) and define the
contribution of these proteins in melanoma cells. Despite Nutlin-3 being described to have
antitumoral activity in some tumor cell types with mutant p53 (Ambrosini et al., 2007), this
was not the case in SK-Mel-28 and WM-1366 (Fig. 2A and results not shown). However,
most lines with wild type p53 responded to Nutlin-3 by a marked (although not absolute)
arrest in cell proliferation (see Fig. 2A), as described in other tumor cells (Huang et al.,
2009). By 3–4 days after treatment, melanoma cells became flattened, vacuolized and
positive for senescence-associated β galactosidase activity (SA-β-Gal; Figs. 2B,C). The
inhibitory effects of Nutlin-3 on melanoma cell proliferation could be observed even upon
removal of this drug (Fig. S2A,B) and without significant induction of apoptosis (Fig. S3A–
C). Normal melanocytes slowed their proliferation (albeit with delayed kinetics), but
importantly with no obvious changes in cell morphology or acquisition of senescent-like
features (see Fig. 2B,C and Fig. S3D, E).

Differential impact of DNA damaging agents and p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors on p53
levels
A possibility to account for the lack of Nutlin-3 induced senescence in melanocytes could be
related to a lower induction and activation of p53-dependent signals than in melanoma cells.
However, protein immunoblots indicated that MDM2 and the p53 target p21 were induced
by Nutlin-3 in both cell types (see Fig. 2D). Interestingly, total and active (Ser-15phosphorylated) p53 accumulated at higher levels in melanocytes. In fact, the induction of
p53 upon treatment of melanoma cells with Nutlin-3 was modest when compared to
doxorubicin (see particularly UACC-62 in Fig. 2D). Altogether, these results further
emphasize the differential wiring of the p53-MDM2 axis in melanocytes and melanoma
cells. Moreover, these data suggest additional roles of the oncogene MDM2 beyond the
simple modulation of p53 expression.

Transient cell cycle arrest in normal melanocytes vs stable senescence-like phenotype in
melanoma cells upon genetic depletion of MDM2

Author Manuscript

Nutlin-3 binds MDM2 specifically at the p53-binding pocket but does not block the
interaction of MDM2 with other targets (Vassilev, 2007). To abrogate all MDM2-associated
functions, melanocytes and melanoma cells were transduced with GFP-expressing
lentiviruses that code for highly selective interfering shRNAs. This approach allowed for
>90% inhibition of MDM2 within 4 days after infection (see Fig. 3A for detailed kinetics in
SK-Mel-103, and Fig. 3B for representative examples in melanocytes and other melanoma
cells). As the case for Nutlin-3, MDM2 shRNA led to a very modest increase in p53 in cells
(SK-Mel-19, SK-Mel-103, UACC-62) in which this protein is not mutated, and even
diminished the expression of p53 loss of function mutants (i.e. in SK-Mel-28).
Immunophotographs showed an equivalent localization of p53 in control or MDM2-shRNA
transduced cells (Fig. 3C). Therefore, MDM2 may be controlling the function, rather than
the localization and levels of active p53. Melanoma cell lines that responded to Nutlin-3,
also arrested when MDM2 was depleted (not shown). In fact, the resulting phenotype of
MDM2 shRNA expressing melanomas was even more marked than for Nutlin-3 (Fig. 3C
and Fig. S2A,D). Flow cytometry analyses indicated a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (Fig. 3C). In
addition, an intense SA-β-Gal staining reinforced the concept of a senescence-like
phenotype after MDM2 depletion (Fig. 3D,E). Depletion of MDM2 in normal melanocytes
(Fig. 3B) delayed cell division, but without signs of premature senescence (Fig. 3D,E).
These results further emphasize the differential wiring of MDM2 in normal and tumor cells,
offering a window for therapeutic intervention.

p16-independent fail-safe mechanism driven by modest changes in p53 in the absence of
MDM2
Given the modest induction of p53 by Nutlin-3 or MDM2 depletion, it was not obvious
whether these agents activated senescence via p53 or as consequence of other deregulated
MDM2 targets. For example, MDM2 can inhibit p21 in a p53 independent manner (Zhang et
al., 2004). In addition, we questioned the role of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor since it is a
key mediator of cellular senescence, and is retained in a proportion of spontaneous
melanomas (Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007). Moreover, the tumor suppressor activities of

p16INK4a can also be modulated by MDM2 (Xiao et al., 1995). To assess these different
scenarios, SK-Mel-103 cells were infected with lentiviruses coding for validated shRNAs
against p53, p21 or p16INK4a. Transduced cells were then treated with Nutlin-3 (Fig. 4A,B;
Fig. S2) or infected with lentivirus coding for MDM2 shRNA (Fig 4C, see also Fig. 5E
below). p53 shRNA but not p16INK4a depletion abrogated cell cycle arrest by both
treatments (Fig. 4A), avoided cell flattening and the acquisition of SA-β-Gal positivity (Fig.
4C; Fig. S4). Inhibitory effects on Nutlin-3 and MDM2shRNA-driven senescence were also
found for p21shRNA, although less efficiently than p53 depletion (Fig. 4A,B; Fig S4).
These data are consistent with cDNA arrays that predicted a key role of p21 opposing
melanoma cell proliferation (Terzian et al., 2010). Of note, p21 induction, which was
obvious as early as 6 hours upon Nutlin-3 treatment (Fig. 4D, E), was completely abrogated
by p53shRNA (see Fig. 5E). Altogether, the data presented above demonstrates that
melanoma cells are “addicted” to MDM2 to blunt the pro-senescence function of p53, an
activity that is modulated by p21 in a p16 independent manner.
DNA damage and MDM2 inactivation signal to p53 with differing effects on E2F1
In the context of defining the mechanism(s) underlying the induction of melanoma
senescence by Nutlin-3 or MDM2shRNA, we considered of interest the MDMX and RB
proteins. MDMX is a p53 repressor that can modulate the efficacy of Nutlin-3 (Hu et al.,
2006). RB is a tumor suppressor that can be marked by MDM2 for ubiquitin proteasome
degradation (Sdek et al., 2005). However, as shown in Fig. 4D, MDMX was regulated in a
similar manner by Nutlin-3 (that blocks proliferation) and doxorubicin (which primes cells
for apoptosis). Moreover, no RB induction was observed in the response to Nutlin-3 or
MDM2 shRNA. In fact, both agents downregulated total and phosphorylated RB by 70–95%
(Fig. 4E).

Author Manuscript

We then focused on E2F1 based on previous reports indicating various positive and negative
feedback loops between this transcription factor and MDM2 (Polager and Ginsberg, 2009).
Interestingly, while E2F1 was upregulated by doxorubicin in melanoma cells, it was
depleted by MDM2 shRNA and Nutlin-3 (Fig. 4D). Importantly, E2F1 downregulation
preceded entry into senescence following MDM2 depletion by shRNA (which occurs at 4–5
days) or after Nutlin-3 treatment (which occurs at 3–4 days) (see Fig. 4E for immunoblots in
SK-Mel-103 and UACC-62). In contrast, normal melanocytes, which do not acquire
senescence-like features upon treatment with Nutlin-3, do also retain E2F1 levels (Fig. S5).

Author Manuscript

Altogether, these data argue for E2F1 downregulation being an active driver of senescencelike features in melanoma cells, instead of a simple byproduct of cell cycle arrest. Consistent
with this hypothesis, depletion of endogenous E2F1 by highly efficient siRNA pools (Fig.
5A) was sufficient to halt melanoma cell proliferation and induce senescence features (Fig.
5B, C). Conversely, short-term ectopic expression of E2F1 in melanoma cells by adenoviral
infection, blunted the ability of Nutlin-3 to induce cell vacuolization or acquire SA-β-Gal
activity (Fig. S6A, B).

Proteasome independent but p53-dependent downregulation of E2F1 by functional loss of
MDM2
The next pending question was to which extent E2F1 was controlled directly by p53/p21 or
whether known roles of MDM2 on ubiquitin-mediated E2F1 degradation (Campanero and
Flemington, 1997; Hofmann et al., 1996) also played a role. The impact of ubiquitindependent degradation was analyzed by pretreatments with the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib. As shown in Fig. 5D, doses of bortezomib that can effectively stabilize
ubiquitylated proteins and the classical proteasome target MCL-1, could not prevent the
downregulation of E2F1 by Nutlin-3.

Author Manuscript

To demonstrate that E2F1 acts downstream of p53 and p21, but not p16, treatments were
performed in an isogenic series of the SK-Mel-103 line generated by transduction of the
corresponding shRNAs. Representative examples of the results obtained are summarized in
Fig. 5E. In short, p16 shRNA, p21 shRNA and p53 shRNA provided a 0%, 70% and 100%
protection, respectively, to Nutlin-3 induced E2F1 depletion. Therefore, these results
indicate that melanoma cells depend on MDM2 to halt inhibitory effects of p53 on E2F1 via
(at least in part) the tumor suppressor p21.
Melanoma cells depend on MDM2 to prevent senescence-like phenotype in vivo

Author Manuscript

To assess the physiological relevance of MDM2 depletion, GFP-labeled SK-Mel-103
transduced with control or MDM2shRNA, were implanted into immunocompromised mice
before any change in cell morphology or proliferation. Caliper measurements (Fig. 6A) and
GFP-based fluorescence imaging (Fig. 6B) revealed a marked inability of MDM2 shRNA
transduced cells to grow as xenografts. Consistent with a senescence-like arrest, MDM2
shRNA-derived tumors showed clear SA-β-Gal positive staining (Fig. 6C). Histological
analyses further demonstrated the downregulation of MDM2 in the bulk of the tumors (Fig.
6D, left panels), as well as cell cycle arrest (visualized by a reduction in Ki67 staining from
30% to 7%, Fig. 6D, central panels), and downregulation of E2F1 (Fig. 6D, right panels). In
conclusion, MDM2 depletion, when efficient, compromises the tumorigenic potential of
otherwise aggressive melanoma cells. Moreover, these results also support the use of E2F1
to gauge the impact of MDM2 loss in vivo.
E2F1 marks the sensitivity of melanoma cells to Nutlin-3 and MDM2 shRNA

Author Manuscript

Active p53 is required for E2F1 downregulation and induction of senescence by Nutlin-3
and MDM2 shRNA (Fig. 4A,B; Fig. 5E). However, not all wild type p53-expressing
melanomas were sensitive to Nutlin-3 and MDM2 shRNA (Fig. 2A). Given the impact of
both treatments on E2F1, we questioned whether this protein could serve as a response
indicator. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared the response of cells that depend (SKMel-103, UACC-62) or are independent (SK-Mel-19, SK-Mel-29) on MDM2. Cells were
treated with Nutlin-3 in the presence or absence of bortezomib (to assess putative effects of
the proteasome on MDM2 and E2F1 in resistant cells). Resistant melanoma cells
accumulated MDM2 efficiently upon Nutlin-3 treatment, but were markedly less potent at
upregulating p21, and showed a complete maintenance of E2F-1 (Fig. 7A and results not
shown). This similar maintenance in E2F-1 levels was also observed for cell lines resistant
to MDM2 shRNA (Fig. 7B).

Author Manuscript

To test the validity of E2F1 as a sensitivity marker of MDM2-based treatments, melanoma
cells were treated with MI-219, a p53-MDM2 inhibitor structurally unrelated to Nutlin-3
(Fig. 7C). MI-219, which exhibits a higher binding affinity for MDM2 (Ki=5 nM) than
Nutlin-3 (Ki=36 nM) (Shangary et al., 2008) was quantitatively more potent at inducing p53
and MDM2. Nevertheless, MI-219 and Nutlin-3 were qualitatively similar. The same
sensitive cell lines showed E2F1 downregulation prior to the induction of cellular
senescence (see Fig. 7D right panels). Conversely, the Nutlin-3 resistant cells, also failed to
induce p21, downregulate E2F1 or alter cell cycle progression in response to MI-219 (see
examples in Fig. 7D). In conclusion, our data identify E2F1 as a biomarker for tumors that
become addicted to MDM2 to deactivate latent pro-senescence signals resulting from the
maintenance of wild type p53.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The generation of bioavailable, and specific p53-MDM2 binding inhibitors is offering an
alternative venue for the treatment of cancers that maintain active (or activatable) p53
(Shangary and Wang, 2009; Vassilev, 2007). Malignant melanomas, which usually present
with wild type p53 (Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007), would therefore be ideal candidates for this
therapeutic strategy. Nevertheless, the implementation of this concept is not straightforward.
First, the traditional resistance chemoresistance of melanoma cells questions the
functionality of this tumor suppressor (Pommier et al., 2004). Secondly, MDM2 is just one
of many post-transcriptional regulators of p53 (Vousden and Prives, 2009). In turn, MDM2
can impinge on tumor cell physiology by diverse p53-independent mechanisms (Wade et al.,
2010). Furthermore, no obvious outcome of Nutlin3 or MI-219 can be predicted from the
genetic background of the cancer cells. Thus, a variety of effects of these compounds have
been reported ranging from apoptosis (Vassilev, 2007), cytoskeletal reorganizations (Moran
and Maki), endoduplication (Shen et al., 2008), DNA damage (Verma et al.), cellular
quiescence (Korotchkina et al., 2009), senescence (Vassilev, 2007), and even treatment
failure in tumors with wild type p53 (Long et al., 2010).

Author Manuscript

Here we have provided genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrating that p53 can
represent a point of vulnerability in selected melanoma cells. Specifically, we have
identified an intrinsic repressive activity of p53, which in the absence of MDM2, would
drive melanoma cells into a senescence-like program. These results are particularly relevant
as melanoma is one of the prime examples of aggressive neoplasms in which senescence
programs must be disengaged as a pre-requisite for tumor initiation. The p53/MDM2 wiring
in melanoma cells and normal melanocytes is not equivalent, providing a window for
therapeutic intervention. Importantly, we identified the transcription factor E2F1 as a
biomarker to gauge the anti-melanoma activity of p53/MDM2 inhibitors.
The comparative analyses of the p53/MDM2 axis performed in melanocytes and melanoma
cells allowed also to address key pending questions in the field: (i) is there a selective
pressure for the maintenance of p53 in melanocytic cells?, (ii) is p53 active (or activatable)
in melanoma cells?, and (iii) is MDM2 controlling stability, cellular localization and/or
function of p53? The results of this study indicate that p53 is largely dispensable for
melanoma cells but required to avoid mitotic defects in normal melanocytes. Moreover, we

demonstrated that p53 depleted melanoma cells had no increased DNA damage and even
showed an enhanced proliferative potential. These results are consistent with various animal
models in which genetic depletion of p53 cooperates with HRAS, NRAS or BRAF-driven
cell transformation (Bardeesy et al., 2001; Patton et al., 2005; Terzian et al.; Terzian et al.,
2010). Instead, nuclear aberrations observed in melanocytes transduced with specific
shRNAs indicated that p53 loss may in fact be detrimental as a very early event in the
neoplastic transformation. The maintenance of viability and absence of senescence shown
here in response to MDM2 shRNA, treatment with Nutlin3 or DNA damaging agents, may
be the reflection of studies in mouse models, in which melanocyte senescence was found to
be driven by ARF but not by p53 (Ha et al., 2007).

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, our data show that melanocytes may indeed be more suited than melanoma
cells to sustain a transient deregulation of endogenous p53. In fact, perhaps one of the most
unexpected results of this study is that melanoma cells can counteract large inductions of
p53 (> 30 fold) when MDM2 is present, but succumb to relative minor changes of this
protein if MDM2 is depleted. This form of cell cycle exit was found without obvious
changes in the cellular localization of p53 (which remained nuclear). Consequently,
although MDM2 can modulate p53 half life and cellular distribution (by its known roles as
an E3 ubiquitin ligase and cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttle, respectively) (Wade et al., 2010),
our data point to a direct control of p53 function as a central role of MDM2 in melanoma
cells (see schematic in Fig. 7E).

Author Manuscript

Nutlin-3 and the interfering hairpins against MDM2 have also served as tools to uncover an
intrinsic basal phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15. This post-transcriptional modification is
indicative of basal cellular stress (Wade et al., 2010). Therefore, these results a consistent
with a scenario in which melanoma cells become addicted to MDM2 by having maintained
p53 in an intrinsically stressful background without mutating or permanently halting its
potential to tumor cell division.

From a mechanistic point of view, the interplay described here among MDM2, p53 and
E2F1 is intriguing. In other systems, MDM2 can either activate or repress E2F1, by p53
dependent and independent pathways (Polager and Ginsberg, 2009). Furthermore, MDM2
can also activate E2F1 indirectly, by interacting and promoting the ubiquitin-dependent
degradation of RB, an E2F1 inhibitor (Xiao et al., 1995). In turn, the crosstalk between
E2F1 and p53 is not less intricate, with positive and negative feedback loops among them
(see schematic in Fig. 7E). Our results indicate that in the melanoma cells tested, MDM2
does in fact have a positive effect on E2F1, but independent from proteasomal degradation
and repression of RB. Instead, MDM2 was found to allow for sustained E2F1 expression, at
least in part, by thwarting inhibitory effects on this protein elicited by p53 via the tumor
suppressor p21. However, other p53-dependent events (i.e. miRNAs such as miR34a, 34b or
34c) may also contribute to the activation of pro-senescence signals as described in other
tumor types (Kumamoto et al., 2008).
Finally, the identification of E2F1 as a putative biomarker for MDM2-based anticancer
therapies also has important translational implications. As indicated above, Nutlin and
MI-219 compounds are paving the way for pharmacological inhibitors of the p53-MDM2

interaction as a plausible anticancer therapy (Vassilev, 2007). It is not realistic, however, to
expect a generalized efficacy of these treatments even if the target tumors follow the
premise of wild type and responsive p53. The loss of E2F1 preceding the induction of
premature senescence by Nutlin-3 or MDM2 shRNA provide a new strategy to gauge the
efficacy of these agents in preclinical models.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, the data presented here indicate that the bypass of premature senescence is
not just a “one time event” at early stages of melanocyte transformation. The combination of
interfering RNAs and structure-based pharmacological inhibitors identified an intrinsic
addiction of melanoma cells to MDM2 tightly associated with the suppression of latent prosenescence signals. This role of MDM2 was found linked not only to the mutational status
of p53, but to the wiring of the transcription factor E2F1. These results provide new insights
into molecular mechanisms of melanoma cell maintenance. In addition, they have practical
implications for the selection of suitable genetic backgrounds for treatments based on p53/
MDM2 interaction inhibition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and reagents
Human melanocytes and melanoma lines were isolated and cultured as previously described
(Verhaegen et al., 2006). Doxorubicin hydrochloride, was purchased from Sigma Chemical
(St. Louis, MO), Bortezomib from Millennium Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA) and
Nutlin-3 from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). MI-219 was synthesized and purified as
described before (Shangary and Wang, 2009).

Cell proliferation and viability assays
Total cell numbers were estimated by manual counting, and cell death rates were determined
by standard typan blue exclusion assays. Experiments were analyzed in triplicate and data
are presented as the mean ± SEM. Analyses of cell cycle proliferation were performed by
flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer and the Cell Quest software (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Senescence-associated β galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity was
assessed and visualized as described using as positive controls melanocytes transduced with
oncogenic BRAFV600E (Denoyelle et al., 2006).
RNA interference

Author Manuscript

Protocols and vectors for lentiviral-mediated expression of shRNAs against p53, p21 and
p16INK4a have been reported before (Denoyelle et al., 2006; Nikiforov et al., 2007;
Verhaegen et al., 2006). To deplete MDM2, a hairpin containing nt 362–380 (GenBank
NM002392) was cloned into KH1-GFP and transduced following previously described
protocols (Denoyelle et al., 2006). Parallel infections with KH1-GFP vectors coding for
scrambled shRNA served as controls. E2F1 expression was inhibited with ON-Target plus
SMARTpool siRNA E2F1 (J-003259-09) using as a reference control the ON-Target plus
Non-targeting Pool (D-00181010-20, ThermoScientific, Epsom, UK).

Tumor growth

Author Manuscript

Athymic NCr-nu/nu mice (Charles River) were kept in pathogen-free conditions and animal
care was provided in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals of the University of Michigan. To analyze the impact of MDM2
inactivation in vivo, 0.5×106 SK-Mel-103 cells expressing MDM2 shRNA or Control
shRNA were injected subcutaneously (s.c) in both rear flanks of 8 week old mice (n=12
tumors per condition). Tumors were imaged in vivo with an Illumatool TLS LT-9500
fluorescence light system (Lightools Research, Encinitas, CA). Tumor volume was
estimated as V=L×W2/2, where L and W stand for tumor length and width, respectively.
Frozen tumors were processed for SA-β-Gal staining and subsequently paraffin embedded as
described elsewhere (Michaloglou et al., 2005). Statistical analyses of tumor growth were
performed with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test for two-group comparisons. Twotailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
