BACKGROUND. Despite extensive studies of atovaquone in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, there is little information about its efficacy
as a prophylactic agent for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in pediatric
patients with cancer. Therefore, a retrospective analysis was conducted to determine the incidence of PCP in pediatric patients who received prophylactic atovaquone during treatment for acute leukemia.
METHODS. We reviewed the medical records of all patients treated at our institu-

RESULTS. Eighty-six patients were unable to tolerate TMP-SMZ and received daily
atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis. PCP was not diagnosed in any patient who
received atovaquone prophylaxis: the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval
(CI) was 1.74 per 100 person-years.
CONCLUSIONS. Atovaquone is an efficacious alternative for PCP prophylaxis in

neumocystis carinii pneumonitis (PCP) is an opportunistic
infection that is life-threatening in immunocompromised persons.1 The first reported case of PCP in the US was a pediatric
patient in 1956.2 Subsequently, sporadic cases were reported in children whose primary immune function was impaired.3 In 1970, Johnson and Johnson4 described an outbreak of PCP in 19 pediatric
patients who were undergoing chemotherapy for cancer at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital. The impaired host immune function
in this pediatric cancer cohort was a secondary effect of the immunosuppressive nature of their anticancer therapies.5,6
Options for the treatment of PCP were limited to pentamidine
isethionate until the mid-1970s, when Hughes et al.7 demonstrated
the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) for
treating PCP in pediatric patients. PCP continued to contribute to
morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer until chemoprophylactic strategies with TMP-SMZ were demonstrated.8,9 Unfortunately,
the usefulness of TMP-SMZ is limited in some patients by unacceptable toxic effects that include rash, fever, and myelosuppression.7,10
Atovaquone is an effective PCP preventive agent for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who cannot tolerate
TMP-SMZ, with similar efficacy to aerosolized pentamidine.11 In
children with HIV infection atovaquone is safe and well tolerated

when taken daily for PCP prophylaxis.12 Despite
extensive studies of atovaquone in HIV-infected
patients, there is little information about its efficacy
as a PCP prophylactic agent in pediatric patients
with cancer. We therefore reviewed our institution’s
experience with the use of atovaquone in pediatric
patients who were being treated for leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 1994 and 2004, approximately 1000 patients
at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude)
were enrolled on institutional and noninstitutional
leukemia protocols. During this period patients intolerant of TMP-SMZ received alternative PCP prophylaxis that continued until 6 months after the
completion of leukemia therapy or until chronic
graft-versus-host disease was resolved. Patients included in this analysis were children enrolled in
institutional protocols for the treatment of newly
diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Total Therapy Studies XIIIA, XIIIB, XIV, and XV) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML91, AML97, AML02) or those
enrolled on other protocols for the treatment of these
leukemias.13–18 The analysis also included 2 patients
treated for myelodysplastic syndrome and juvenile
chronic myeloid leukemia. Patient medical records
were reviewed to determine demographic data, primary diagnosis, disease status at the time atovaquone
therapy was initiated, treatment protocol, length of
time on atovaquone therapy, and the occurrence
of PCP. TMP-SMZ intolerance included but was not
limited to the patient’s history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or trimethoprim, fever,
rash, urticaria, allergic reaction, neutropenia, or elevation of transaminases. All leukemia protocols were
approved by the St. Jude Institutional Review Board
and written informed consent was obtained from
patients, parents, or guardians. This retrospective
study was conducted after approval by the St. Jude
Institutional Review Board.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows patient demographic and clinical
characteristics at the time of receipt of atovaquone.
Eighty-six patients with hematologic malignancies
received atovaquone for prevention of PCP. Their
mean age was 10.7 years (SD, 5.8 years). Sixtyfive patients were in first complete remission and
21 were being treated for relapsed or refractory
disease during receipt of their atovaquone prophylaxis. Thirty-seven of the 86 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplan-

The time and efficacy of atovaquone chemoprophylaxis are shown in Table 2. As expected from the
duration of treatment of the primary disease, the
median duration of atovaquone therapy was longer
for the 57 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (584 days) than for the 29 patients with
myeloid malignancy (204 days). The total personyears for atovaquone therapy was 172.1. None of
these patients developed PCP. Therefore, the incidence of PCP in this group of patients was zero (95%

DISCUSSION
In this analysis, we found atovaquone to be effective
in preventing PCP in pediatric leukemia patients
who were intolerant of TMP-SMZ. This result was
equivalent to the success in chemoprophylaxis achieved with TMP-SMZ (given daily for 2 years) in the
Hughes et al.8 prospective study in 80 pediatric
patients with cancer. In that study, 17 of the 80
patients who did not receive chemoprophylaxis with
TMP-SMZ (21%) developed PCP, whereas no cases of
PCP were observed in those pediatric patients who
received prophylactic TMP-SMZ.8 On the basis of the
reported results from this early study of prophylaxis
by Hughes et al.,8 we estimate that the PCP incidence was 24.3 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 14.4–
38.4) in the placebo group. Additionally, Hughes
et al.9 did not observe any cases of PCP in the 74
patients with cancer treated at St. Jude when TMPSMZ was administered on an intermittent schedule
(3 consecutive days per week) over a 2-year period.
The current retrospective pediatric leukemia
patient cohort was similar in size to that of Hughes
et al.8,9 and had received even more intensive therapy. Intensive anticancer therapy in the recent era, in
the absence of PCP prophylaxis, continues to place
patients at risk for PCP. A report by Lyytikainen
et al.19 in 1996 provides an indication of the incidence of PCP in acute leukemia in patients receiving
no PCP prophylaxis during intensive chemotherapy.
Of the 29 cases studied, PCP occurred in 7 patients
(24%)19; these results are similar to the 20% incidence reported by Hughes et al.8 in 1977 for acute
lymphoblastic leukemia patients before PCP prophylaxis. Furthermore, in 2001 Poulsen et al.20 identified
PCP in 13 of 71 Danish children (18%) with ALL in
whom PCP prophylaxis was stopped after the induction and consolidation phases of chemotherapy. For
the current cohort at St. Jude, atovaquone provided
effective PCP chemoprophylaxis for the 65 patients
who received intensive contemporary frontline therapy for newly diagnosed leukemia as well as for the
21 patients who received even more intensive therapy for relapsed or refractory leukemia. Moreover,
atovaquone chemoprophylaxis was efficacious in the
37 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT during
this 10-year period. As an alternative agent for PCP
prophylaxis, we continue to use atovaquone in leukemic or stem cell transplant patients at an oral dose
of 30 mg/kg once daily, with the maximum daily
dose of 1500 mg/day (prophylactic dose for adults).

In comparison studies of PCP in patients with
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), atovaquone was a less effective therapy than TMP-SMZ
but had fewer treatment-limiting adverse effects.21
The treatment failure rate for atovaquone was 20%,
whereas that of TMP-SMZ was 7%.21 Conversely,
treatment-limiting adverse effects occurred in 7% of
patients receiving atovaquone and 20% of those on
TMP-SMZ, giving overall therapeutic success rates of
62% and 64%, respectively. Therapeutic efficacy was
related to the plasma concentration of atovaquone. It
is noteworthy that a poorly soluble tablet formulation of atovaquone (no longer in use) was used in
the early trials. The improved suspension formulation was introduced in 1995, providing a 2-fold
increase in bioavailability.22 Although atovaquone is
less effective than TMP-SMZ in treating PCP, its activity and its well-tolerated toxicity profile make it a
useful alternative agent for patients intolerant of
TMP-SMZ. Atovaquone has been approved by the
FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate PCP in
patients who cannot tolerate TMP-SMZ.
For PCP prophylaxis in TMP-SMZ-intolerant
individuals, the use of atovaquone has been reported
and compared with alternative prophylactic agents
such as pentamidine and dapsone.11,23,24 However,
many of the prospective clinical comparative studies
have been limited to HIV-infected adults. Chan
et al.11 observed daily atovaquone to have similar
efficacy when compared with monthly aerosolized
pentamidine for PCP prophylaxis in HIV-infected
individuals intolerant of TMP-SMZ. In another comparison study of atovaquone and pentamidine in
adults with AIDS and PCP, atovaquone showed therapeutic activity and fewer adverse effects.25 In these
studies atovaquone was well tolerated and rash was
often cited as an adverse event. El-Sadr et al.24 compared atovaquone to dapsone and noted both agents
to be similarly effective for PCP prophylaxis in HIVinfected patients (aged 13 years and older). Although
it is convenient to administer a PCP prophylactic
agent monthly, the effective administration of aerosolized pentamidine may not always be possible in
younger pediatric patients. Moreover, methemoglobinemia is an adverse event associated with dapsone
administration and has been recently reported by
Mandrell et al.26 in 4 pediatric patients from St. Jude
and by Williams et al.27 in 3 of 15 children with leukemia—all patients were intolerant of TMP-SMX and
were receiving dapsone for PCP prophylaxis. Clinical
pediatric studies in patients with HIV using atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis or for the prevention of
serious bacterial infections have shown this agent to
be well tolerated in children as young as 1 to 3
months of age.12,28

PCP Prophylaxis in Pediatric Leukemia/Madden et al.

Adverse events, including rash and diarrhea,
have been reported in patients who were receiving
atovaquone chemoprophylaxis for PCP.12,21,25,29 However, prospective studies in patients with HIV, and
recipients of autologous hematopoietic cell transplants, have confirmed its use as an alternative to
TMP-SMZ.12,29 The frequency of intolerance to prophylactic TMP-SMZ ranges from <6% to 20% in
patients with cancer; fever, rash, abdominal pain,
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are among the
most commonly reported adverse effects.9,10,30 Neutropenia is of particular concern in oncology, not
only because of the risk of infection but also because
chemotherapy may be delayed by prolonged neutropenia. Colby et al.29 conducted one of the few prospective, randomized studies that compared
atovaquone and TMP-SMZ in transplant patients.
PCP chemoprophylaxis was given to 39 patients prior
to their autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplants for solid tumors or hematologic malignancies
and was restarted after engraftment.29 Engraftment
was similar in both groups. No cases of PCP were
observed in either group. None of the patients who
received atovaquone had any adverse reaction,
whereas 8 of the 19 patients (40%) who received
TMP-SMZ were removed from the study because of
drug intolerance. Similar efficacy using atovaquone
prophylaxis for PCP was observed in 28 orthotopic
liver transplant patients intolerant of TMP-SMZ.31
Although 50% of the patients were noted to have
side effects attributed to atovaquone (diarrhea, bloating, or abdominal pain most frequently reported),
Meyers et al.31 observed no cases of PCP in these
solid organ transplant patients treated for 1 year
with daily atovaquone.
Although the same agents used for PCP prophylaxis in patients with HIV are efficacious in pediatric
patients with cancer, it is less well known whether
these alternative agents for PCP prophylaxis alter the
metabolism of anticancer drugs or whether they
have other adverse effects on this patient population.
In this regard, the effect of atovaquone on etoposide
in pediatric patients has been studied by Van de Poll
et al.32 at St. Jude. They compared the intraindividual
effects of atovaquone and TMP-SMZ on the pharmacokinetics of the anticancer agent etoposide by using
a crossover study design. Nine patients were randomly assigned to receive either TMP-SMZ or atovaquone during continuation chemotherapy. Etoposide
pharmacokinetics were then analyzed for each
patient after a single dose of intravenous etoposide.
Approximately 8 weeks later, each patient was
crossed over to the other PCP chemoprophylactic
agent and the etoposide pharmacokinetic studies

1657

were repeated. The results showed a slight increase
in the area-under-the-concentration curve of etoposide and its metabolite (median increase, 8.6% and
28.4%, respectively) with atovaquone. The long-term
significance of this effect of atovaquone on etoposide
pharmacokinetics is unknown. Such findings emphasize the need for prospective pharmacokinetic studies in patients receiving anticancer therapies when
new agents (such as atovaquone) are introduced on
a long-term basis, particularly when drugs have similarities in their metabolic pathways.
Although the data presented here are the result
of a single-center retrospective analysis and are subject to the limitations inherent in such a study, no
episodes of PCP were observed in the 86 pediatric
patients who had leukemia and received atovaquone
chemoprophylaxis. This finding suggests that atovaquone is an effective alternative agent for PCP chemoprophylaxis in pediatric patients with leukemia
who are intolerant of TMP-SMZ.
