Abstract
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is increasingly used in clinical studies of brain tumor to provide
information about tissue metabolic profiles. In this study, we evaluated changes in the levels of metabolites
predominant in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (rGBM) to characterize the response of rGBM to antiangiogenic therapy. We examined 31 rGBM patients treated with daily doses of cediranib, acquiring serial
chemical shift imaging data at specific time points during the treatment regimen. We defined spectra from three
regions of interest (ROI)—enhancing tumor (ET), peritumoral tissue, and normal tissue on the contralateral side
(cNT)—in post-contrast T1-weighted images, and normalized the concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)
and choline (Cho) in each ROI to the concentration of creatine in cNT (norCre). We analyzed the ratios of these
normalized metabolites (i.e., NAA/Cho, NAA/norCre, and Cho/norCre) by averaging all patients and categorizing
two different survival groups. Relative to pretreatment values, NAA/Cho in ET was unchanged through day 28.
However, after day 28, NAA/Cho significantly increased in relation to a significant increase in NAA/norCre and a
decrease in Cho/norCre; interestingly, the observed trend was reversed after day 56, consistent with the clinical
course of GBM recurrence. Notably, receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that NAA/Cho in tumor
shows a high prediction to 6-month overall survival. These metabolic changes in these rGBM patients strongly
suggest a direct metabolic effect of cediranib and might also reflect an antitumor response to antiangiogenic
treatment during the first 2 months of treatment. Further study is needed to confirm these findings. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a severe and generally
fatal brain tumor, with an annual incidence of approximately
9,000 in the United States. Despite aggressive treatment strategies involving surgery, radiation, and cytotoxic chemotherapy, the average survival time for a patient with GBM is less
than 1 year, and fewer than 5% of patients survive 5 years or
more (1). Innovative therapeutic approaches are desperately
needed for this patient population. GBM is typically characterized by marked angiogenesis and, paradoxically, severe hypoxia
and necrosis (2–5). Angiogenesis in GBM is mediated by VEGF

(6–8), which leads to dysfunctional and highly permeable
microvessels, characterized by abnormalities in pericyte coverage and basement membrane thickness (2, 9–11).
Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF-A ligand, was approved by the FDA in May 2009 for
use as a monotherapy for recurrent GBM (rGBM), on the basis
of phase II evaluations (12). However, the mechanisms by
which antiangiogenic therapies benefit these patients are not
well understood. Jain and colleagues have shown that antiVEGF therapies "normalize" the tumor vasculature. Their
findings in both preclinical models and a clinical trial of rectal
cancer have indicated that anti-VEGF therapy leads to reductions in microvessel density and mean blood vessel diameter,
basement membrane thickness, tumor interstitial pressure,
and vasculature permeability as well as enhanced pericyte
coverage (10, 13, 14).
A phase II clinical trial of cediranib, a potent oral pan-VEGF
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, showed that vascular normalization was induced at 24 hours and lasted to 28 days in
recurrent GBM patients, as determined by structural and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) metrics (15,
16). However, these functional and structural improvements
were reversed, and the tumor reverted to an abnormal state
with further continuation of cediranib therapy. These findings
thus suggest there may be a "normalization window" during
which delivery of chemotherapeutics may be optimized.

A preclinical study of GBMs in mice showed that use of
cediranib can lead to a decrease in edema by vascular normalization as well as prolonged survival, even as tumor growth
persists (17). The study suggested that the benefits of antiangiogenic therapies might be partially due to anti-edema
effects rather than direct antitumor effects. However, other
investigators have noted direct antitumor effects of VEGF
blockade (18), as well as tumoristatic activities—that is, tumor
growth inhibition and tumor cell apoptosis—in a broad range
of human tumors (19–21), and a possible inhibitory effect on
stem cell–like glioma cells (22). Thus, although the extent of
vascular normalization after one dose of cediranib correlates
with both progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in
rGBM patients (23), underscoring the clinical importance of
vascular normalization, the degree of antitumor effect, if any,
beyond vascular normalization in this class of therapies
remains uncertain in humans.
Early magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies
showed clear differences between the spectral profiles of
tumor and normal brain tissues. For example, choline
(Cho) is typically elevated in brain tumors and metastases,
potentially because of increased cellular turnover and the
accelerated membrane synthesis that occur in rapidly dividing
cancer cells (24, 25). Levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA),
regarded as a neuronal marker, decrease in any disease that
adversely affects neuronal integrity (26). Hence, relative to
normal healthy brain tissue, neoplastic tissue generally exhibits elevated Cho concomitant with decreased NAA (27), a
hallmark widely used in clinical practice. Given these metabolic characteristics of tumors, proton MRS (1H-MRS) may be
able to improve demarcation of cancerous brain tissue when
used in combination with the high-quality anatomic data
provided by conventional MRI techniques.
In this study, we compared 1H-MRS data and conventional
MRI data in a group of patients undergoing cediranib monotherapy for rGBM. Our results suggest that 1H-MRS confirms
the findings from MRI and provides additional information to
improve understanding of cancer responses to antiangiogenic
agents in rGBM patients.

Materials and Methods
Patient recruitment
Thirty-one patients (mean age, 53.7; range, 20–77) with
rGBM were recruited for this study. Every patient underwent
surgical resection and radiochemotherapy after initial diagnosis and pathologic confirmation of GBM. At the time of
enrollment into the study, all patients had tumor recurrence,
as determined by MRI and/or neurologic deterioration.
All patients received an oral dose of cediranib (45 mg) daily,
which was reduced as necessary (15, 16) until there was
radiographic or clinical evidence of disease progression. Neurologic and physical examinations and MRI studies were done
throughout the course of treatment.
MRI and spectroscopy
Magnetic resonance studies were done by using a 3T MRI
scanner (Tim Trio; Siemens) at a series of time points: 5,

1, 1, 26 to 28, 54 to 56, and 110 to 112 days from the start of
cediranib treatment.
We conducted serial 2-dimensional (2D) chemical shift
imaging (28) by using point-resolved spectroscopy (29) for
signal prelocalization and outer volume saturation (30) to
minimize contamination from subcutaneous fat. Water suppression was achieved with a modified chemical selective
saturation (31) method known as water suppression enhanced
through T1 effects (32). Acquisition parameters included
weighted k-space sampling time to repetition and time to
echo in spin (TR/TE) ¼ 1,700/135(144) ms, number of acquisition ¼ 3, nominal resolution 1  1  1.4 cm3. First- and secondorder shimming was done automatically, followed by manual
adjustment. Data selected for analysis had a typical full width at
half maximum in the range of 20 Hz for the water line.
The MRI protocols used conventional sequences (T1, T2,
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) post-Gd T1, and
volumetric post-Gd image) and dynamic sequences (dynamic
contrast enhanced, dynamic susceptibility contrast, and diffusion tensor imaging), as reported by Batchelor and colleagues
(refs. 15, 16; see details in Supplementary Data A).
Data analysis
For 11 of 31 patients, MRS quality was inadequate to reliably
detect distinct signals from the metabolites in the tumor. In
some of these patients, MRS quality was compromised by
tumor location near the skull; because in these cases, shimming could not be adequately carried out, the signal was
considerably contaminated by fat (5 of 11 patients). In addition, in some patients, marked necrosis in the lesion caused
indistinguishable peaks in the spectra (8 of 11 patients). Those
spectra were objectively excluded from the data before further
processing to ensure reliable analysis. The spectra obtained
from 20 of the total group of 31 subjects were included in
quantitative measurements.
We analyzed the spectroscopic raw data by using LC Model
6.1 Software (33), with a manual script written in Matlab. The
spectra were grouped in 3 regions of interest (ROI), defined by
the corresponding T1-weighted postcontrast images at baseline
for (i) enhancing tumor, (ii) non-enhancing surrounding tumor
(peritumoral tissue), and (iii) normal tissue on the contralateral
side of tumor. The location and numbers of the voxels in each
ROI were serially consistent across all time points, although
there were changes in the intensity of enhancement as a
consequence of treatment. To accurately assess tumor metabolism, the voxels in the enhancing tumor were selected so as to
avoid areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, calcification, cysts, or
ventricles. Only fitted spectra with SD (% SD) lower than
25%, per Cramer–Rao lower bounds automatically provided
by the LC model, were accepted. There was no subjective
spectral apodization. The concentrations of all metabolites were
normalized to the normal side creatine concentration (norCre).
We examined the changes in metabolite concentrations
during treatment by analyzing the ratio of NAA to Cho and the
ratios of NAA and Cho to norCre. Typical spectra (Fig. 1) show
that the NAA peak is higher than the Cho peak in normal
tissue, whereas the ratio is reversed in tumor, that is, Cho
peaks above NAA.

Figure 1. Three ROIs were defined on the corresponding T1-weighted postcontrast images: (i) enhancing tumor (red voxels), (ii) nonenhancing
surrounding tumor-–that is, peritumoral tissue (blue voxels), and (iii) normal tissue on the contralateral side of tumor (green voxels). To obtain an accurate
assessment of tumor metabolism, the voxels in enhancing tumor were selected by avoiding areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, calcification, or cysts.
Typical MRS spectra were obtained from contralateral normal tissue (left) and enhancing tumor (right). These show an NAA peak higher than the Cho peak in
normal tissue, whereas the ratio is reversed in the tumor; ppm, parts per million.

Changes in the MRI parameters were additionally analyzed (see details in Supplementary Data B). We assessed the
vascular indexes by analyzing changes in the contrastenhanced T1-weighted tumor (CE-T1) volume, vessel size
(VS), and Ktrans [volume transfer coefficient; in this nonflow
limited state, assumed to mainly represent permeability (P)]
within regions of enhancement. We quantified the waterrelated indexes, the functional consequences of vascular
normalization, using 3 different techniques that indicate
hydration level. We measured: (i) T2-weighted abnormality
FLAIR, (ii) trace apparent diffusion coefficient of water
(ADC), and (iii) extracellular extravascular space fraction
(Ve), within regions of enhancement. We also derived the
absolute T1 relaxation time constant values from variable
flip angle T1 mapping sequences.
We analyzed the MRS/MRI data in relation to OS, and on
the basis of the 6-month survival threshold, categorized all
patients as "high OS" or "low OS" responders. Metabolite
ratios on days 1, 28, and 56 were compared with baseline
ratios. We computed Student t test P values against the null
hypothesis, which assumes no change in metabolite ratios
during treatment. The changes in MRI parameters (i.e., CET1, VS, P, FLAIR, ADC, and Ve) were analyzed in a similar
way. Statistical significance determined by Student paired
t test was accepted at a confidence level of 95% (P < 0.05).
We conducted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
statistical analysis to determine how predictive the MRS
measurements were of 6-month survival. Numerical data
were presented as average  1 SD. The number of subjects
included in the analysis at each time point is given in
Supplementary Table S1.
No corrections were made for T1 or T2, or for possible
variations in water concentration between normal and tumor
tissues. Our data analyses are strictly semiquantitative, as
routine clinical studies do not allow for data acquisition to
correct for metabolite and water relaxation. In addition, we
have assumed tissue–water concentration in the tumor is
similar to that in normal brain tissue; hence, we calculated
only the apparent metabolite concentrations.

Results
Table 1 shows the averaged values of 3 metabolite ratios
(i.e., NAA/norCre, Cho/norCre, and NAA/Cho) with SDs, the
coefficients of variation, and P values tested by Student
t statistics between 2 pretreatment visits in 3 ROIs. Relatively
small mean differences were observed between 2 baselines,
with moderate but acceptable coefficients of variation (<30%).
Figure 2 shows a representative example of serial T1 postcontrast MR images and raw spectra in 1 representative voxel
(denoted by the dark-lined box) of the enhancing tumor region
during the time course of treatment. The spectra display
dynamic changes of peak of each metabolite in the range
of 0.5 to 4 parts per million (ppm).
Figure 3 shows the changes in the NAA/norCre, Cho/
norCre, and NAA/Cho ratios relative to pretreatment values,
as well as lipid and lactate levels normalized by norCre,
averaging across all eligible patients.
The primary metabolic index in Fig. 3A, NAA/Cho, provides
a combined picture of the most commonly used diagnostic
criterion of metabolic changes for some types of tumors (27,
34, 35). Many studies have reported lower NAA/Cho ratios in
tumors (compared with normal tissue) because of decreased
levels of NAA and/or increased levels of Cho (36–39); such
findings are frequently interpreted as resulting from the
replacement of normal brain tissue by cancerous tissue.
Although averaged, NAA/Cho in both enhancing tumor and
peritumor regions showed no significant change until 28 days;
there was significant increase between days 28 and 56 (P ¼
0.01), then a subsequent decrease. In the contralateral normal
tissue, NAA/Cho was relatively constant.
As illustrated in Fig. 3B, the ratio of lipids and lactate
(including all lipid peaks in the range of 0.5–2 ppm) in
enhancing tumor versus Cre on the contralateral normal side
(norCre) decreased significantly on day 56. As in the case with
other metabolites, (lipids and lactate)/norCre was relatively
stable in the contralateral normal tissue.
Figure 3C and D show the individual behavior of the
metabolites normalized by Cre in the contralateral tissue

findings of others in the whole 31-patient sample (16). In both
the larger data set of 31 patients and the subset of 20 patients
from whom we acquired MRS data, the volume of CE-T1
decreased until day 28 and thereafter began to increase. An
abrupt and substantial decrease in Ktrans (mean approximately
70%) was noted immediately after the first dose of cediranib
(day 1). The relative tumor vessel size also decreased until
day 28 and began to increase after day 28. We observed
sustained decrease in vasogenic edema, shown by reduced
FLAIR lesion volumes, ADC, and Ve for the duration of the
therapy. These findings suggested a high probability of antipermeability effects of cediranib until day 28.
We analyzed MRS/MRI findings in relation to OS times of
patients on the basis of the 6-month survival threshold. Early
posttreatment time points (i.e., days 1, 28, and 56) may be the
most important for treatment management because early
indications of therapeutic outcome provide better opportunity
to optimize therapeutic intervention and improve survival (40).
As shown in Supplementary Figure S2, the MRS
data indicated no significant difference in the ratios of the

(norCre). Figure 3C illustrates a sharp increase in NAA/norCre
in the enhancing tumor after a single dose of cediranib. The
increase was present until day 56 (P ¼ 0.02), at which time
point the value began to decrease until the end of the study (P
¼ 0.04). In the peritumoral region, NAA/norCre increased
until day 28 and remained relatively constant close to the
normal value (i.e., 1.5) until day 112 (P ¼ 0.04).
In contrast, Cho/norCre (Fig. 3D) in the enhancing tumor
showed a different pattern: an increase up to day 28 (P ¼ 0.03),
a decrease from 28 to 56 days, and then no change until the
end of the study (day 112). The decrease in Cho reached
statistical significance (P ¼ 0.047) between days 28 and 56. A
similar trend was found in the peritumoral region. In the
contralateral normal tissue, both NAA/norCre and Cho/
norCre remained relatively constant.
We also analyzed the changes in the MR parameters relative
to baseline for the same subset of 20 patients; for reference,
results are shown in Supplementary Figure S1.
The MRI data from the subset of patients from whom we
also acquired analyzable MRS data were similar to the MRI

used clinical MRS measure for discriminating normal and
abnormal tissues (27), notably showed an increase in the "high
OS" group (15%, 9%, and 40% with P < 0.05 on days 1, 28, and
56, respectively), although showing a decrease in the "low OS"
group (12%, 10%, and 20% on days 1, 28, and 56,
respectively). On the basis of this finding, we carried out
ROC analysis to determine the probability that NAA/Cho
predicts 6-month survival. In Table 2, the values of an area
under the ROC curve (AUC) and P values at early time points,
particularly days 28 and 56, showed the high possibilities (74%
and 95%) and the significances (0.02 and 0.01).
We compared the relative changes in the ratios of the 3
metabolites before and after 1 dose of cediranib to the changes
in the absolute values of norCre and the T1 relaxation time
constant in Supplementary Figure S4. The comparison
showed subtle changes in norCre and T1 time constant after
one dose, confirming that changes in NAA/norCre are independent of norCre and T1 changes.

In this clinical study, we sought to identify metabolic
changes in rGBM, using MRS to distinguish the changes
induced by cediranib treatment. We observed elevated Cho,
lactate, and lipid peaks, with very low NAA peak, in enhancing
lesions and a reverse metabolite profile in contralateral normal
tissue at baseline. The mean values of NAA/Cho were 2.4 in the
enhancing tumor and 5.0 in normal tissue. These results mirror

the classic patterns of metabolite peaks seen in high-grade
gliomas and the mean values that have been measured in other
published reports (27, 39, 41–43). Our results also confirm the
ability of MRS to evaluate tumor response to treatment (27, 39,
44–48). Our results both extend earlier studies to track metabolic changes induced by an antiangiogenic agent in tumor
tissue and report several new findings.
The first new observation is the consistency of the NAA/Cho
ratio with increased concentration of both Cho and NAA in
tumoral as well as peritumoral regions during the vascular
normalization window of 28 days (15). One interpretation of
these findings is that tumor cells are not directly killed during
the initial normalization window, and the marked changes in
tumor enhancement observed in conventional MRI reflect
antivascular effects of the antiangiogenic drug. This interpretation is compatible with preclinical results reported (17). The
decrease in tumor size and the consequential shift in brain seen
until 1 month after treatment initiation might reasonably
prompt one to conclude that NAA/norCre and Cho/norCre
increases are attributable to partial volume effects. A statistically significant decrease in hydration level (i.e., vasogenic
edema, as seen by ADC) during 1 month may also account
for these changes.
The second observation is a significant increase in
NAA/Cho, with a significant reduction in Cho and an
increase in NAA after 28 days. This finding suggests that
cediranib has a direct effect on cellular metabolism in rGBM
patients—an effect that is temporally separated from its
anti-vascular effects and distinct from preclinical models of
cediranib—possibly because of the longer survival times
seen in humans compared with animal models of GBM.
Further evidence of this direct metabolic effect is supported
by a significant decrease in observed lipids and lactate after
day 28; it has been previously shown that the spectra from
active GBM contain elevated peaks of lipids (27, 42). Snuderal and colleagues (submitted manuscript) observed
reduced cellular density in the central area of the tumor
in the autopsies of 5 cediranib-treated patients included in
our study population. This morphologic finding is consistent with the metabolic changes we detected. Also of note is
that the delayed antitumor effect associated with antiangiogenic treatment has also been reported in other tumor
types (49, 50).
Interestingly, ADC in MRI showed a decrease, primarily
because of the significant antipermeability effect of cediranib, overwhelming its cytotoxic effect, as an increase in

ism for cytotoxic therapies. At baseline, the value of ADC
was already high and after edema greatly reduced, ADC
dropped to a normal level especially within 28 days, indicating a window of vascular normalization. However,
between 28 and 56 days, there was no significant decrease
in ADC; in fact, we observed a slight increase in the
responding group, which was likely related to the cytotoxic
mechanism of cediranib. Therefore, considering the different mechanisms of antiangiogenic and cytotoxic therapies,
there would not be a complete discrepancy between ADC
and 1H-MRS.
The trend we observed in the MRS data was reversed after
day 56, consistent with the general clinical course of tumor
recurrence and the eventual death of the patients. These
findings might imply that, although cediranib does have direct
effects on metabolism in some tumor cells, those cells that
survive despite blocked angiogenesis are eventually able to
continue to grow.
A third observation in our study is the high probability of
NAA/Cho to predict 6-month survival of rGBM patients
treated by cediranib, as determined by ROC analysis. The
changes in NAA/Cho illustrated in Fig. 4 showed positive
values in "high OS" responders compared with negative values
in the "low OS" group. A ROC analysis of NAA/Cho showed
high significances on day 28 (P ¼ 0.02, AUC ¼ 0.74) and day 56
(P ¼ 0.01, AUC ¼ 0.95). Together, these data might imply that
it is the critical time frame between 28 and 56 days that
discriminates the tumor response to this antiangiogenic
agent. This finding suggests that NAA/Cho has good correlation with tumor responses for predicting 6-month survival on
the antiangiogenic treatment, reflecting a combined picture
for the opposite changes of 2 primary metabolites.
We acknowledge that this study is limited by its small
sample size and, more importantly, by our still-incomplete
understanding of the correlations between MRS findings and
tissue morphology. The conventional interpretations of the
MRS findings in glioblastoma were generated primarily in
the pre-antiangiogenic era. Although a direct antitumor effect
is the interpretation most consistent with our MRS findings in
this study, we cannot at this stage rule out other possible
interpretations and additional studies with larger sample sizes
are warranted.
This prospective study provides preliminary evidence that
cediranib elicits direct metabolic effects in rGBM; traditionally
such findings have been interpreted as antitumor effects
resulting from vascular normalization based on the dynamics
of the predominant brain metabolites. Our data also suggest
that, with further technical advances, early changes in metabolites detectable by 1H-MRS might be able to serve as
imaging biomarkers to predict treatment response in patients
with recurrent malignant GBMs. NAA/Cho changes in enhancing tumor tissues suggest that anti-VEGF therapy not only
has an antivascular effect but also that such an effect modulates tumor and brain tissue, both early and late in the
disease process. These findings, if confirmed in larger studies,
could shed further light on the mechanism of action of this
new class of antiangiogenic agents and potentially even be
used to make treatment management decisions.
