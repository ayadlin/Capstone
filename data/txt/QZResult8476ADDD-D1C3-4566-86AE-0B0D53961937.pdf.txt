ABSTRACT
Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive, strongly chemoresistant liver malignancy.
Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6 family cytokine, promotes progression of
various carcinomas. To investigate the role of LIF in cholangiocarcinoma, we evaluated
the expression of LIF and its receptor (LIFR) in human samples. LIF secretion and
LIFR expression were assessed in established and primary human cholangiocarcinoma
cell lines. In cholangiocarcinoma cells, we tested LIF effects on proliferation, invasion,
stem cell-like phenotype, chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (gemcitabine+cisplatin),
expression levels of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Mcl-1) proteins, with/
without PI3K inhibition, and of pSTAT3, pERK1/2, pAKT. LIF effect on chemotherapyinduced apoptosis was evaluated after LIFR silencing and Mcl-1 inactivation.
Results show that LIF and LIFR expression were higher in neoplastic than in
control cholangiocytes; LIF was also expressed by tumor stromal cells. LIF had no
effects on cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation, invasion, and stemness signatures,
whilst it counteracted drug-induced apoptosis. Upon LIF stimulation, decreased
apoptosis was associated with Mcl-1 and pAKT up-regulation and abolished by PI3K
inhibition. LIFR silencing and Mcl-1 blockade restored drug-induced apoptosis.
In conclusion, autocrine and paracrine LIF signaling promote chemoresistance
in cholangiocarcinoma by up-regulating Mcl-1 via a novel STAT3- and MAPKindependent, PI3K/AKT-dependent pathway. Targeting LIF signaling may increase

steadily increased over the last few decades [1]. Despite this
trend, treatment options remain limited to surgical resection
and liver transplantation, and the overall survival beyond
a year from diagnosis still remains less than 5% [1, 2]. In
fact, resection can only be offered to a minority of patients
(20–40%) because of a propensity for early intrahepatic

INTRODUCTION
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly aggressive
cancer arising from epithelial cells lining intrahepatic (iCCA)
or extrahepatic (eCCA) bile ducts. Although considered
a rare tumor, incidence of CCA (particularly iCCA) has

or lymph node metastatic dissemination, whereas liver
transplant is available only for carefully selected cases in a
few, highly-specialized liver centers [2, 3]. Both procedures
are further complicated by high rates of recurrence [2,
3]. For patients ineligible for surgery, palliation including
radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy or stenting to relieve
biliary obstruction, may provide some benefit [2, 4]. Notably,
chemotherapy is recognized as largely ineffective due to the
high resistance of CCA cells to drug cytotoxicity [5]. A recent
study shows that combined administration of gemcitabine
(GEM) and cisplatin (CDDP) in the treatment of advanced
CCA increases patient overall survival [6] of about four
months compared with patients treated with GEM alone [6].
Mechanisms of chemoresistance in CCA are poorly
understood but the extensive desmoplastic reaction typical
of CCA has been suggested to play a role. In fact, the close
interplay between the cancer and surrounding stromal
cells, i.e. cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and tumorassociated macrophages (TAM), may be responsible for
providing cancer cells with several pro-invasive functions,
including proliferation, invasion, migration and resistance
to apoptosis [7, 8]. Among the cytokines released within
the tumor microenvironment, interleukin (IL)-6 plays a
pivotal role in CCA pathogenesis, as a potent stimulator
of cancer growth and progression [9, 10].
Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic
pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-6
superfamily secreted by a variety of cells including
epithelial and stromal cells (fibroblasts, monocytes,
macrophages and T-cells), albeit generally at very low
levels [11]. However, LIF secretion may be stimulated
by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1 and
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, leading to elevated serum
LIF levels in cancer patients [12, 13]. LIF effects on
cell functions are multifaceted, but still not extensively
detailed. They include differentiation and maintenance of
pluripotency, proliferation and apoptosis, pro- and antiinflammatory stimuli, depending on the cell maturity
and the cell type that the cytokine is acting upon [11, 13,
14]. Following LIF binding, the low affinity LIF receptor
(LIFR) dimerizes with the glycoprotein (gp) 130 subunit,
to form a high-affinity complex which transduces the LIF
signal through different intracellular pathways, including
Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) [15]. Increasing
numbers of studies support LIF as an important player in
tumorigenesis and metastatic spread in various epithelial
cancers [16–19]. LIF and LIFR/gp130 were found to
be expressed in most of 30 human carcinoma cell lines
[20]. However, LIF effects were extremely variable, and
often opposing, as it induced proliferation in breast and
pancreatic carcinomas but apoptosis in colon and gastric
carcinomas; these effects were strictly influenced by the
signaling pathways activated [20].

To date, very little is known about the role of
LIF in CCA. Therefore, in this study, we sought: 1) the
distribution of LIF, LIFR, and gp130 in human CCA liver
tissue derived from surgical resection; 2) the secretion of
LIF and expression of LIFR in primary and established
human CCA cell lines; 3) the functional effects of LIF
on CCA cells with respect to: a) cell proliferation and
invasion, b) cell viability and apoptosis in response to the
chemotherapeutic agents currently used in CCA (GEM,
CDDP), c) the induction of a stem cell-like phenotype; d)
the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins; and e)
the downstream effectors of the signal transduction.

RESULTS
LIF, LIFR and gp130 were extensively
expressed by bile ducts in CCA compared to
peritumoral tissue
Analysis of histological sections from resected
human CCA liver revealed a significantly more
extensive immunoreactivity of LIF (p < 0.001) and LIFR
(p < 0.001) (Table 1) on bile ducts in tumoral areas (Figure
1A, 1C) compared with matched, peritumoral tissue (Figure
1B, 1D). Bile ducts of peritumoral areas were LIF-negative
in all 12 samples, whilst 17/19 (89%) of neoplastic tissue
contained LIF-positive bile ducts of different degree
(Table 1). Similarly, the tumor reactive stroma surrounding
the neoplastic bile ducts showed more extensive LIF
immunoreactivity than the peribiliary stroma in peritumoral
tissue (p < 0.001) (Table 1). Immunofluorescence studies
revealed, more specifically, that in the tumor reactive
stroma, LIF was expressed by inflammatory cells (CD45
positive), likely including macrophages, lymphocytes
and neutrophils as evaluated by immunoperoxidase,
and CAF (α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) positive)
(Figure 1G, 1H). Only 4/12 peritumoral samples (33%) had
extensive (>30%) LIFR staining in bile ducts, however,
extensive LIFR positivity in neoplastic bile ducts was
present in 17/19 (89%) CCA samples (Table 1). Gp130
expression on bile ducts in CCA and peritumoral tissue
paralleled that of LIFR (Figure 1E, 1F). By categorizing
the CCA areas, a significantly higher extent of LIF staining
in ‘ductular-like’ than in ‘mucin-producing’ tumoral bile
ducts was determined (Supplementary Figure 1A, 1C);
in contrast, no significant differences in the extent of
LIFR staining were found between the two CCA subtypes
(Supplementary Figure 1B, 1C).

LIFR protein expression was greater in
CCA than controls
Relative amounts of LIFR protein obtained from
primary and established CCA cell lines, and control
cholangiocytes were evaluated by Western blotting

significant increase in the proliferative rate, except for
a minimal change with the lowest dose in TFK-1 cells
(Supplementary Figure 4A, 4B). Additionally, no change
in invasive functions was observed with both CCA cell
lines in response to LIF (Supplementary Figure 4E, 4F). To
understand whether lack of LIF’s proliferating effects was
affected by autocrine LIF production by CCA cells, possibly
inducing a constitutive activation of cell proliferation which
precludes further activation upon ligand stimulation, we
evaluated MTS assay in CCA cells with genetic inactivation
of LIFR. The quality of the reduction in LIFR expression in
HuCCT-1 and TFK-1 cells was evaluated by both real-time
PCR and WB using 3 different siRNAs (Supplementary
Figure 3). Using the 2 most effective siRNAs (siRNA1 and
siRNA2), LIF’s effects on cell proliferation were evaluated
by comparing silenced cells with scrambled controls in
absence of rhLIF stimulation. No MTS decrease was
found in LIFR silenced cells compared with scrambled
controls (Supplementary Figure 4C, 4D). We next turned
at evaluating whether LIF can protect CCA cells from
the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs currently
used in the treatment of CCA. HuCCT-1 and TFK-1 cells
were treated with CDDP, GEM, and GEM+CDDP after
a pre-incubation with/without LIF, and their viability
assessed by MTS. A drug-induced decrease in cell viability
by 34–89% and 23–64% was observed in HuCCT-1 and
TFK-1 cells, respectively (Table 2). This cytotoxic effect
was significantly counteracted by rhLIF, which augmented
cell viability by up to 69.0 ± 36.7% in HuCCT-1 (Figure
3A) and 73.1 ± 17.7% in TFK-1 (Figure 3B) cells. To

LIF secretion by cholangiocytes was variable
Using ELISA, no significant difference was
found between the amount of LIF secreted by primary
cholangiocytes from CCA and controls (29.9 ± 28.7 vs.
20.7 ± 0.3 pg/mL). However, the amount of LIF secreted
by primary CCA cholangiocytes was extremely variable,
ranging from 0 to 95.7 pg/mL (Figure 2B). Amongst the
established CCA cell lines, HuCCT-1 (iCCA) and TFK1 (eCCA) expressed LIFR and secreted LIF (Figure
2A, 2B), as confirmed by immunofluorescence in cultured
cells (Figure 2C, 2D), therefore these cell lines were
selected for subsequent in vitro experiments.
Data on LIFR expression and LIF secretion
(obtained by WB analysis and ELISA respectively) were
further confirmed by real-time PCR in established and
primary CCA cell lines as well as in control cholangiocytes
(Supplementary Figure 2A, 2B).

of LIFR C. and gp130 E. was more homogeneous. In contrast, LIF B., LIFR D. and gp130 F. immunoreactivity was significantly less in bile
ducts of matched peritumoral tissues. By immunohistochemistry and dual immunofluorescence we demonstrate that LIF (green) was also
extensively expressed by CD45+ inflammatory cells (red, G.) and α-SMA+ cells (CAF, red, H.) that juxtaposed neoplastic biliary structures

understand whether cytoprotection was related to antiapoptotic mechanisms promoted by LIF, we assessed
active caspases 3/7. Up-regulation of these caspases is
the hallmark of an apoptotic response and is observed in
CCA cell lines exposed to GEM+CDDP. The pre-treatment
with rhLIF significantly reduced caspases 3/7 activity
by 24% in HuCCT-1 and 22% in TFK-1 cells compared
to cells challenged with GEM+CDDP in absence of LIF
pre-treatment (Figure 3C, 3D). LIF’s ability to exert
cytoprotective effects in CCA was confirmed in cells
silenced for LIFR. Following treatment with GEM+CDDP,
genetic inactivation of LIFR in cells exposed to rhLIF

led to an increased activation of caspases 3/7 of an extent
comparable to scrambled cells and to cells without rhLIF
pre-treatment (Figure 3C, 3D).

LIF did not induce a stem cell-like phenotype in
established CCA cell lines
To evaluate whether the protective potential of LIF
against apoptosis was associated with a dedifferentiation of
CCA cells to a stem cell-like phenotype, as described for LIF
in malignant melanoma [17], we studied the gene expression
of stem cell markers, Nanog and Oct4, following LIF

cell line. In contrast, LIF stimulated the phosphorylation
of AKT (Figure 5E, 5F). The modulatory effect of the
PI3K/AKT pathway on LIF-induced Mcl-1 up-regulation
was confirmed by treating CCA cells with LY294002, a
specific PI3K inhibitor, which significantly reduced Mcl-1
expression in LIF-stimulated HuCCT-1 and TFK-1 cells
(Figure 4C, 4D).

LIF-induced Mcl-1 up-regulation is mediated by
PI3K/Akt, but neither by STAT3 nor ERK1/2
activation, in CCA cells
To dissect the intracellular signaling that mediates
the protective effect of LIF against drug-induced apoptosis
in CCA cells, relative expression levels of pBax (proapoptotic protein), and Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (anti-apoptotic
proteins) were studied by WB in LIF pre-treated HuCCT-1
and TFK-1 cells. Compared with untreated cells, pBax
levels remained unchanged (Supplementary Figure
6A,  6B), whilst Mcl-1 levels increased significantly in
both CCA cell lines (Figure 4A, 4B). In contrast with pBax
and Mcl-1, Bcl-2 was not expressed in either HuCCT-1
or TFK-1 cells (data not shown). LIF did not induce

the conventional LIF downstream effector STAT3 or
MAPK/ERK; 5) in vitro inactivation of Mcl-1 prevents
cytoprotective effects exerted by LIF from GEM+CDDPinduced apoptosis in CCA cells.
In CCA, both cholangiocytes and stromal cells
(CAF and inflammatory cells) are a source of LIF;
conversely, LIF was not expressed by bile ducts in the
peritumoral regions. In tumoral epithelia, LIF expression
was heterogeneous, with a greater extensiveness in areas
of a ductular phenotype. These findings are consistent with
a recent study showing that LIF is overexpressed in CCA
in conjunction with Oncostatin M, another IL-6 family
cytokine that is closely related to LIF, with pleiotropic
functions in cell differentiation, proliferation and invasion
[23]. In culture conditions, we could confirm that LIF
was variably secreted by CCA cells, in keeping with
the heterogeneous distribution observed in histological
specimens. LIF production by tumor cells directly
correlates with a more invasive phenotype [24].
LIF secretion may be induced by several proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and
TGF-β, variably released by macrophages and activated
T-cells populating the local inflammatory microenvironment
[12, 13, 25], as well as by the hypoxic conditions typically

DISCUSSION
In this study we investigated the role of LIF in
CCA, a malignancy with extremely poor prognosis, with
a view to unveiling molecular mechanisms responsible
for its peculiar aggressiveness, and that may be amenable
of therapeutic intervention. We demonstrate that in
CCA: 1) LIF is expressed both in the bile ducts,
particularly in the ‘ductular-like’ rather than ‘mucinproducing’ subtype, and the stromal cell compartment,
including CAF and TAM; 2) its cognate receptor LIFR is
selectively up-regulated in neoplastic cholangiocytes; 3)
LIF primarily aids tumoral cholangiocytes to resist
apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic agents
GEM and CDDP, without affecting cell proliferation,
invasion or the gain of stemness signatures; 4) antiapoptotic mechanisms are mediated by Mcl-1, through

featured in CCA [17]. Once secreted, LIF itself may induce
the expression of LIFR by malignant cells, thus stimulating
a positive loop [12, 17]. Our immunohistochemical, WB
and real-time PCR data show that LIFR was selectively upregulated in CCA bile ducts. Transduction of LIF signaling
occurs through its binding to the LIF receptor complex
consisting of LIFR and the glycoprotein gp130. As opposed
to LIFR, every cell type within the human body can express
gp130 [26]. Nevertheless, we verified the expression
of gp130 and found that it displayed a profile similar to
LIFR, thereby indicating that LIF signaling is functionally
active in tumoral cholangiocytes. Therefore, the de novo
expression of LIF and the up-regulation of LIFR in CCA
bile ducts, along with LIF overexpression in the tumor
reactive stroma, indicate the presence of autocrine and
paracrine LIF-mediated mechanisms in CCA. Znoyko
et al. also suggested that an autocrine LIF/LIFR axis is
active in reactive ductules of cirrhotic livers based on their
intense neoexpression compared with bile ducts in normal
liver, likely acting as an important signal for ductular
reaction [27]. It is interesting to note that in our CCA
series, LIF expression was more prevalent in the tumoral
areas characterized by a ‘ductular-like’ appearance than by
a ‘mucin-producing’ phenotype. These two specific iCCA
phenotypes have been recently proposed to originate from
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

topographically distinct cholangiocyte subpopulations,
the major hilar ducts for the ‘mucin-producing’ form,
and the smaller ducts associated with hepatic progenitor
cells for the ‘ductular-like’ variant [28]. Further studies
are warranted to understand whether LIF expression may
indeed represent a signature of an iCCA subtype arising
from hepatic progenitor cells.
Despite the observation that LIF was prevalently
expressed in the ‘ductular-like’ areas of CCA, we found
that LIF did not exert any proliferative or pro-invasive
effects in tumoral cholangiocytes. LIF’s effects on
neoplastic cells are highly variable, and its failure to
stimulate proliferation or invasiveness has also been
reported in other epithelial cancers [20]. The nature of the
functional effect of LIF in different cancer cell types are
dependent upon the signal transduction pathways that may
be activated downstream of the receptor [11].
Our data illustrate that LIF enabled CCA cells to
resist the pro-apoptotic effects induced by chemotherapeutic
agents, such as GEM and CDDP, recently proposed in
the treatment of advanced CCA [6]. In CCA cells that
were exposed to GEM+CDDP treatment, LIF was able to
increase their viability by up to 73% compared with the
LIF-untreated cells. In accordance with these findings,
LIF was able to hamper the increase of active caspases

3/7 induced by GEM+CDDP by 22–24% in both CCA
cells, a fundamental step initiating the cascade of events
ultimately leading to apoptosis. Relevance of LIF signaling
in conferring anti-apoptotic properties to CCA cells
was confirmed by the restoration of cytotoxicity from
GEM+CDDP when LIFR was silenced.
To study the mechanisms of resistance to druginduced apoptosis mediated by LIF, we first evaluated
the possible involvement of LIF in inducing a stem celllike phenotype in CCA cells. Cancer stem cells have an
unlimited capacity for self-renewal and a high capacity
for drug resistance, and therefore their activation in CCA
may explain the failure of current chemotherapies. LIF
was recently reported for regulating stemness transcription
factors, including Nanog and Oct4, in malignant melanoma
[17]. Furthermore, Nanog and Oct4 are recognized as
signatures of a stem cell-like phenotype in multiple types
of human cancer as well as molecular players of resistance
to gemcitabine or cisplatin treatment [29, 30]. However, in
our experimental conditions, LIF failed to influence their
gene expression levels, meaning the anti-apoptotic effect of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LIF is unlikely to be related to a dedifferentiation of CCA
cells to a cancer stem cell phenotype. Therefore, we turned
to study the balance between the pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. The anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 acts as a survival factor both in
hematogenous and solid tumors, and is currently regarded
as a major oncogene [31]; its presence has been reported
in both normal and malignant cholangiocytes [32]. We
demonstrated that Mcl-1 expression is further augmented
by LIF treatment in CCA cells, whilst the pro-apoptotic
pBax expression remained unchanged, suggesting that this
dysregulation could be a pivotal mechanism responsible
for the resistance to apoptosis induced by LIF. The JAK/
STAT3, MAPK/ERK or PI3K pathways are three effectors
putatively activated by LIF signaling [15, 16, 33] and
may be involved in the regulation of Mcl-1 expression in
the IL-6-mediated resistance to apoptosis in CCA [9, 10,
33]. Therefore, we first looked at the activation of STAT3
and ERK1/2, classical signals downstream of LIF [11,
33]. However, LIF was unable to alter the levels of either
pSTAT3 or pERK1/2 in CCA cholangiocytes, in vitro. On

the other hand, LIF stimulation up-regulated pAKT in
both CCA cell lines, while their treatment with LY294002,
a specific PI3K inhibitor, reduced the LIF induced upregulation of Mcl-1. This demonstrates that the positive
modulation of Mcl-1 in CCA cells is dependent upon
PI3K/AKT activation, as reported in breast cancer [16],
nasopharyngeal carcinoma [18] and rhabdomyosarcoma
cells [34]. The chemoresistant effects of LIF have also been
reported in colorectal cancer cells by negatively regulating
the tumor-suppressor p53 through a STAT3-dependent
pathway [35]. In our in vitro model, Mcl-1 inactivation
by UMI-77 restored sensitivity of CCA cells challenged
with LIF to chemotherapeutic agents. This finding is in
accordance with recent data indicating that maritoclax, a
similar selective inhibitor of Mcl-1 via stimulation of its
proteosomal degradation, is able to potently enhance druginduced apoptosis exerted by the small-molecule Bcl-2
inhibitor ABT-737 in melanoma cells [36].
Overall, our results indicate that LIF signaling
in CCA is a mechanism that promotes cancer growth
and progression. Whereas LIF does not affect cell
proliferation or invasion of cancer cells, it protects

malignant cholangiocytes from chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis via a STAT3- and MAPK-independent, PI3K/
AKT-dependent Mcl-1 activation. The pro-oncogenic
effects of LIF rely on its secretion by both the tumoral
cells themselves and the adjacent reactive stromal cells
acting on the LIFR aberrantly expressed by neoplastic
bile ducts (Figure 6). In particular, the autocrine effect
is prominent in the ‘ductular-like’ areas of iCCA. On
the other hand, LIF-mediated paracrine effects highlight
the treatment-resistant functions exerted by the tumor
reactive stroma in epithelial cancers with abundant
desmoplasia. Since our histological samples were
obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection,
and, in our center, chemotherapy is only reserved for
those with advanced CCA (which generally do not
perform histological evaluation), correlating LIF/
LIFR expression with clinical data was not possible in
the present study. However, we demonstrated that the
downstream effectors of LIF signaling may represent
innovative molecular targets amenable to thera­
peutic modulation to increase CCA responsiveness to
conventional chemotherapy.

Figure 6: The working model illustrating the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemotherapy-resisting effects of
LIF in neoplastic cholangiocytes. In CCA, LIFR is up-regulated by cholangiocytes under the influence of LIF released by both the

neoplastic cholangiocytes (autocrine loop) and the tumor reactive stromal cells, including CAF and TAM (paracrine loop). When LIFR
dimerizes with gp130, LIF signaling is transduced through PI3K/AKT rather than the conventional STAT3 or MAPK/ERK pathways to
increase levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, which confers resistance to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents by reducing
activation of caspases 3/7.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

LIF secretion by cultured cholangiocytes

Tissue samples

The supernatants of CCA and control cholangiocytes
cultured for 24 h at a density of 5 × 104 were evaluated for
the presence of secreted LIF using an ELISA kit, according
to the supplier’s instructions (Raybiotech, Milan). For each
experiment a LIF standard curve was generated.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of
surgically resected CCA liver from 19 patients were
included in the immunohistochemical study and compared
with the corresponding peritumoral areas where available
(n = 12). The patients were predominantly male (12/19), with
a median age of 64 years (min 35; max 81), and 63% (12/19)
were iCCA. CCA areas were then categorized as ‘ductularlike’ or ‘mucin-producing’ according to Komuta [28].

Cell proliferation
HuCCT-1 and TFK-1 cells were cultured at a density
of 1 × 104 for 48 h with/without exposure to increasing
doses (0.1, 1, 10, 100 ng/mL) of recombinant human LIF
(rhLIF, R&DSystems). Proliferation activity was assessed
by MTS assay according to the supplier's instructions
(CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay, Promega).

Cell lines
Three established human CCA cell lines were used:
EGI-1, TFK-1 (both eCCA, purchased from Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen,
DSMZ, Germany), and HuCCT-1 (iCCA, from Health
Science Research Resource Bank, HSRRB, Japan), along
with primary biliary cell preparations obtained from
surgically resected human iCCA liver samples (n = 7),
as described [37]. Human cholangiocytes isolated from
liver explants of alcoholic liver cirrhosis (n = 2) served
as controls. All specimens were reviewed by the same
dedicated pathologist (AF) to confirm diagnosis. Local
regional ethical committee approval was obtained for
tissue collection and cell preparations.

Cell viability
MTS assay was also used to assess whether LIF (24
h pre-treatment at 0.1, 1, 10, 100 ng/mL) affected viability
of HuCCT-1 and TFK-1 cells in response to a 24 h
treatment with cisplatin, 17 μM (CDDP; Sigma-Aldrich)
[39] and gemcitabine, 30 μM (GEM; Sigma-Aldrich) [40],
either alone or in combination (GEM+CDDP).

Stem cell-like phenotyping
Real-time PCR was used to assess LIF effects
(100 ng/mL) on Nanog and Oct4 gene expression. RNA
was isolated from cultured cells, as described [41]. Further
details are available in the supplementary section.

LIF, LIFR and gp130 expression in tissues
By immunohistochemistry we evaluated the
expression of LIF, LIFR and gp130 in bile ducts
and the stromal compartment in both neoplastic and
matched peritumoral areas. Further details are provided
in the supplementary online section. The extent of
immunoreactivity was scored by two independent
observers (SDM, MC) as: 0 = < 5%; 1 = 5–30%; 2 = 30–
70%; 3 = > 70% area of positive cells, as reported [38].
In selected tissue specimens, dual immunofluorescence
for LIF and α-SMA (myofibroblast marker) or CD45
(inflammatory cell marker) was performed to assess the
specific contribution of the different stromal cell types to
LIF production.

Cell invasiveness
The invasiveness of HuCCT-1 and TFK-1 cells was
assessed by Boyden chamber assay as described [42].
Methodology is detailed in the Supplementary Materials.

Downstream effectors of LIF signaling
in CCA cells
After exposure of HuCCT-1 and TFK-1 cells to
rhLIF (10, 100 ng/mL) for 15 mins (STAT3, pSTAT3,
ERK1/2, pERK1/2, AKT, pAKT) or 24 h (Bax, pBax,
Bcl-2 and Mcl-1), their expression levels were evaluated
by WB (see Supplementary Materials). To unravel the
pathway regulating Mcl-1, its protein expression was also
measured in CCA cells treated with the PI3K chemical
inhibitor, LY294002 (10 μM, Sigma) [43], for 10 mins,
then with rhLIF plus inhibitor for 24 h.

LIF and LIFR expression in cells
To evaluate conformity of immunohistochemical
findings with in vitro data, LIF and LIFR expression
were then assessed in cultured cholangiocytes by
immunocytochemistry. Further details are provided in the
supplementary online section. LIFR protein expression
was also assessed by WB in both established and primary
CCA cholangiocyte lines. See Supplementary Materials
for details. Furthermore, gene expressions of LIF and
LIFR on CCA cell lines were evaluated by real-time PCR
(see Supplementary Materials).

Activation of caspases 3/7
HuCCT-1 and TFK-1 cells were seeded into a 96well plate at 1 × 104 per well with/without rhLIF (100 ng/
26061

Oncotarget

mL) for 24 h followed by treatment with GEM+CDDP
for 12 h. The luminescence-based solution Caspase-Glo 3/7
(Promega) was then used to assess activation of caspases
3/7. Luciferase reaction was evaluated using a microplate
reader (BMG Labtech).

Mcl-1 inactivation

Abbreviations

Apoptotic response following GEM+CDDP trea­
tment, assessed as described above (Activation of
caspases 3/7), was also evaluated upon Mcl-1 inhibition
in HuCCT-1 and TFK-1 cells. We used a novel, selective,
small molecule inhibitor of Mcl-1, UMI-77 (10 μM), for
24 h [22]. Antagonism of Mcl-1 function by UMI-77 does
not depend on the down-regulation of this protein, but on
the ability to block the heterodimerization of Mcl-1 with
several members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bax, Bak
and Noxa [22, 44]. Inhibitory effect of UMI-77 is related
to its binding to the BH3-binding groove of Mcl-1.
