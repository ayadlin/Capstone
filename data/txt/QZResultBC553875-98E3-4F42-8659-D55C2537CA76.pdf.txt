Abstract
Colorectal cancer is a major health problem and the second cause of cancer related
death in western countries. Signaling pathways that control tissue homeostasis are
often deregulated during tumorigenesis and contribute to tumor development. Studies
in mouse models have shown that the p38 MAPK pathway regulates homeostasis in
colon epithelial cells but also plays an important role in colon tumor maintenance. In
this study, we have investigated the role of p38 MAPK signaling in patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs) from three different human colon tumors representing clinical
heterogeneity and that recapitulate the human tumor conditions both at histological
and molecular levels. We have found that PH797804, a chemical inhibitor of p38
MAPK, reduces tumor growth of the three PDXs, which correlates with impaired colon
tumor cell proliferation and survival. The inhibition of p38 MAPK in PDXs results in
downregulation of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is a key regulator of
colon tumorigenesis. Our results show the importance of p38 MAPK in human colon
tumor growth using a preclinical model, and support that inhibition of p38 MAPK
signaling may have therapeutic interest for colon cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

of CRC in order to develop effective treatments.
Mouse models have been widely used to mimic
human CRC, including expression of APCmin for familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP) colon cancer and chemical
treatments with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran
sodium sulfate (DSS) for colitis-associated colorectal
cancer (CAC). CAC represents 1-2% of worldwide CRC
incidence, while FAP cases represent approximately 1%
of total CRC diagnoses per year [6, 7]. Perhaps the best
model to mimic human sporadic CRC is to use AOM
treatment without DSS, as colorectal tumors formed in
this case recapitulate key human pathological features
of human CRC. However, tumor induction by AOM can
easily take more than 6 months with tumor multiplicity

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second cause of
cancer related mortality in developed countries. Colorectal
tumors are of epithelial origin and develop from sequential
mutations in several signaling pathways including Wnt,
K-Ras, p53 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β [1,
2]. At the time of diagnosis, about 35% of patients have
stage IV metastatic disease and 20-50% of patients with
stage II or III disease will progress to stage IV at some
point during the course of the disease [3, 4]. CRC typically
metastasizes to liver and lung. Unfortunately, 5-year
survival rate for metastatic colon cancer is below 10% [5].
Therefore, it is necessary to further understand the biology

and penetrance depending on mouse strain and the AOM
batch [8].
While both APCmin and AOM/DSS models have
greatly enhanced our understanding of the basic biology
underlying CRC, these models do not allow accurate
testing of potential therapies [9]. Patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs) are emerging as reliable models that
are closer to clinical settings in different tumor types [1013]. PDXs can be considered as predictive preclinical
models [9] and have provided promising platforms for
therapeutic decision-making in patients with solid tumors
[14].
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
p38α can regulate many processes important for tissue
homeostasis and that are often deregulated in cancer [15].
Several studies support a tumor suppressive role for p38α
during the onset of malignant transformation [16-18].
Recent work has shown that p38α signaling is important
for maintaining the homeostasis of the colon epithelium in
mice [19-21]. Moreover, specific downregulation of p38α
in intestinal epithelial cells enhances AOM/DSS-induced
CAC [20, 22]. However, unlike many tumor suppressors
that are inactivated during the malignant transformation
process, inactivating mutations for p38α have not been
consistently detected in human solid tumors. This
probably reflects that tumor cells can benefit from the
versatility of this signaling pathway. In line with this idea,
p38α signaling has been shown to be important for the
survival and proliferation of colon tumor cells in vitro and
in mouse models [20, 23-26]. These observations make the
p38α pathway a potential therapeutic target.
Human tumors are heterogeneous in nature,
therefore the response to anti-cancer drugs varies among
different human tumors. We have used PDXs from three
human colorectal tumors with distinct properties and show
that inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling reduces colon
tumor growth in all cases.

histology and the K-Ras mutation status. Histological
analysis revealed that both early and experimental
passages of the CCR-038 and CCR-010 PDXs were very
similar to the corresponding original tumors (Figure 1B).
The original human tumor CCR-038 was a moderately
differentiated adenocarcinoma while CCR-010 was a
neuroendocrine carcinoma. We could not obtain the
original sample of the human tumor CCR-024, but this
model also retained the histological features of moderate
to poor differentiation in the early and experimental
passages (Figure 1B).
To further examine potential histological
differences, the CCR-010 original human tumor and the
PDXs were immunostained for CD56, a known marker for
neuroendocrine differentiation. We found no differences
in CD56 expression between the original tumor and the
PDXs (Suppl. Figure S1). Similarly, PAS staining was used
in model CCR-038 to detect mucin-secreting cells, which
indicate adenocarcinomas. Again, no differences were
found between the CCR-038 original tumor and the PDXs
(Suppl. Figure S1), suggesting that cellular differentiation
was not significantly altered in the tumors of the PDXs.
Moreover, K-Ras mutation status was also confirmed in
the experimental PDXs compared with the parental human
tumors (Suppl. Figure S2). Altogether, these data indicate
that histological and genetic characteristics are conserved
in different passages of the PDXs and that these models
can be used as a tool to recapitulate the human tumor
conditions.

Inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling reduces tumor
growth in PDXs
Pharmacological
inhibition
or
genetic
downregulation of p38 MAPK signaling in established
AOM/DSS-induced colon tumors reduces tumor burden in
mice [20]. To investigate the role of p38 MAPK signaling
in the PDXs from CRC, we used the inhibitor PH797804.
This chemical compound effectively inhibits the p38α
and p38β MAPKs, without affecting other MAPKs such
as ERK1/2 and JNK, and it is used in clinical trials for
inflammatory diseases [27]. Tumors in PDXs were
allowed to grow up to a measurable size (150-200 mm3)
and then mice were randomized into two groups, which
received either PH797804 or vehicle. Models CCR-010
and CCR-024 showed a decrease in tumor size when
treated with PH797804 during the first 5-7 days. Then,
tumors started to grow again although significantly slower
than the vehicle treated tumors. These two models were
treated for 10 days (Figure 2). Model CCR-038 showed
a more pronounced growth inhibition during all the
treatment with PH797804. Due to the different response
observed, in this case we extended the treatment until day
16 to confirm that tumor growth inhibition was maintained
(Figure 2). Therefore, tumor growth was significantly

growth.

found (Figure 3). We also analyzed the presence of mucus
secreting epithelial cells by PAS staining as well as the
neuroendocrine differentiation by CD56 immunostaining.
However, pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK
affected neither the neuroendocrine differentiation in
model CCR-010 nor the mucus secreting epithelial cells
in model CCR-038 (Suppl. Figure S1). These results
indicate that the reduced tumor growth observed upon p38
MAPK inhibition does not correlate with changes in the
differentiation stage of the tumoral cells.

Histological analysis of PDXs treated with p38
MAPK inhibitor
To investigate in more detail the reduction in
tumor growth observed upon p38 MAPK inhibition, we
examined possible alterations in tumor histology. H&Estained sections from the initial tumors and from PDXs of
mice treated with vehicle or the p38 MAPK inhibitor were
analyzed at different time points but no differences were

with p38 MAPK inhibitor

from the tumor growth curves, the effect of p38 MAPK
inhibition in both models was more important at the early
times. In fact, impaired growth of CCR-010 and CCR024 tumors was already observed as early as 2 days after
starting the treatment with PH797804 (Figure 2). At late
time points, tumors still showed decreased proliferation
but apoptosis was not affected (Figure 4), which probably
contributed to the PH797804-treated tumors starting to
grow again slowly (Figure 2). In contrast, p38 MAPK
inhibition reduced cell proliferation at the early time point
without affecting apoptosis in CCR-038 tumors (Figure
4). In conclusion, p38 MAPK signaling can regulate the
proliferation and survival of colon tumor cells in a tumortype dependent manner but pharmacological inhibition of
this pathway leads to reduced tumor growth in the three
PDXs analyzed.

Interfering with p38 MAPK signaling in AOM/
DSS-induced colon tumors reduces proliferation and
enhances death of the tumor cells [20]. Since p38 MAPK
inhibition does not affect the differentiation status of the
three PDXs tested, we determined cell proliferation and
cell death indexes. We analyzed an early time point in the
middle of the treatment (day 5 for CCR-010 and CCR024; day 8 for CCR-038) and a late one at the end (day
10 for CCR-010 and CCR-024; day 16 for CCR-038).
We found that for CCR-010 and CCR-024 tumors, cell
proliferation measured by counting Ki67+ or BrdU+ cells
was significantly reduced and apoptosis was increased in
the mice treated with PH797804 (Figure 4). As expected

Effect of p38 MAPK inhibition in signaling
pathways of human colon tumor cells

similar mechanisms were involved as in mouse colon
tumors. Gene expression analysis showed that in CCR010 tumors, IL-6, CXCL-1 and CXCL-2 mRNAs were all
downregulated at both early and late time points upon p38
MAPK inhibition compared to vehicle treatment (Figure
5). Expression of IL-6 and CXCL-1 mRNAs was also
reduced at both time points analyzed in CCR-024 tumors
treated with PH797804, while CXCL-2 mRNA expression
was only reduced at the late time point (Figure 5). In CCR038 tumors, the expression of IL-6, CXCL-1 and CXCL2 mRNAs was significantly downregulated only at the
early time point upon PH797804 treatment (Figure 5). In
contrast, the expression of IL-11 mRNA was only affected
by p38 MAPK inhibition at the late time point in CCR-038
tumors but not in the other two PDXs (Suppl. Figure S3).

There is good evidence that IL-6 family cytokines
(IL-11 and IL-6) and STAT3 signaling are important
for the survival and proliferation of colon tumor cells
in mouse models [28-32]. Moreover, the chemokine
receptor CXCR-2 and its ligands CXCL-1 and CXCL-2
have been proposed to facilitate the growth of spontaneous
and inflammation-associated colon tumors [33]. Genetic
downregulation of p38α in AOM/DSS-induced mouse
colon tumors reduces tumor growth, which correlates with
reduced levels of IL-6, IL-11, CXCL-1 and CXCL-2 [20].
Since p38 MAPK inhibition reduced tumor growth in the
three PDXs models from CRC, we investigated whether

Treatment with SB202190, another pharmacological
inhibitor of p38α and p38β MAPKs, has been reported
to reduce the proliferation and survival of human colon
cancer cell lines [23, 25]. This effect of SB202190
correlated with upregulation of the receptor tyrosine
kinase HER-3, which was proposed to induce activation
of the ERK1/2 pathway, and GABARAP, a protein
associated with autophagic vacuole formation [23, 25].
However, the reduced tumor growth observed in PDXs
from CRC upon p38 MAPK inhibition with PH797804
did not correlate with consistent changes in the expression
of HER-3 or GABARAP mRNAs. In fact, only CCR-038
tumors treated with PH797804 showed some increase in
HER-3 expression at the early time point (Suppl. Figure
S3). To address this apparent discrepancy, we treated three

human colon cancer lines with SB202190 or PH797804.
In agreement with previous reports [25], we observed that
SB202190 induced autophagic vacuoles in the three colon
cancer cell lines. In contrast, PH797804 did not induce
the formation of vacuoles in any of the colon cancer cell
lines (Suppl. Figure S4A). As a control, we confirmed
that SB202190 and PH797804 both efficiently inhibited
the UV-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway,
as determined by the impaired phosphorylation of the
downstream targets MK-2 and Hsp27 (Suppl. Figure
S4B). Moreover, we found neither upregulation of HER3 and GABARAP mRNAs nor activation of the ERK1/2
pathway in the colon cancer cell lines treated with either
SB202190 or PH79704 compared to the vehicle (DMSO)treated cells (Suppl. Figures S5A and S5B). Taking

levels were determined at early time points (day 5 for CCR-010 and CCR-024 and day 8 for CCR-038) and at the end of the experiment (day
10 for CCR-010 and CCR-024 and day 16 for CCR-038) by counting either Ki67+ and BrdU+ cells or Cleaved caspase-3+ cells. Proliferation
and apoptosis in the initial tumors were given the value of 1 and relative indexes were determined for vehicle or PH797804-treated PDXs.

together, our results indicate that p38 MAPK inhibition
does not affect the expression of HER-3 and GABARAP,
which are therefore unlikely to contribute to the reduced
tumor growth observed in the PDXs from human colon
tumors.
Interestingly, the reduced levels of IL-6 mRNA
observed in the PDXs upon p38 MAPK inhibition
correlated with reduced phosphorylation of STAT3, an
important regulator of colon tumor cell proliferation and
survival (Figure 6). We also found increased activating
phosphorylation of JNK upon p38 MAPK inhibition in
the PDXs (Figure 6), which is consistent with the ability
of p38 MAPK to negatively regulate JNK signaling and
the implication of sustained JNK activation in apoptosis
[15, 34]. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway in
PH797804-treated PDXs was confirmed by the reduced

phosphorylation of the downstream target Hsp27 (Figure
6). We also detected reduced p38 MAPK phosphorylation
in PH797804-treated tumors (Suppl. Figure S6).
Moreover, increased cell death in PDXs treated with
PH797804 correlated with increased expression of the
pro-apoptotic protein Bax in CCR-010 (Suppl. Figure S7),
and with reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein
Mcl-1 in CCR-024 (Suppl. Figure S7), both at early time
points upon p38 MAPK inhibition. The expression level of
Bak did not change in any of the PDXs (Suppl. Figure S7).
Collectively, our data using PDXs that mimic human
pathological conditions of CRC based on key histological
features and K-Ras mutation status, indicate that p38
MAPK signaling contributes to human colon tumor
growth.

DISCUSSION

free survival in CRC patients who do not respond to
chemotherapy [39]. Our results show that inhibition of
p38 MAPK signaling impairs tumor growth irrespective
of K-Ras mutation status or type of colon tumor. It would
be interesting to extend our observations using other p38
MAPK inhibitors currently available for clinical trials.
However, there seem to be differences in the underlying
basis for the reduced tumor growth observed in the PDXs,
as p38 MAPK inhibition mainly affects cell proliferation
but not survival in CCR-038 tumors, whereas both cell
proliferation and survival are impaired in CCR-010 and
CCR-024 tumors. Intriguingly, PH797804 appeared to be
more effective inhibiting the growth of CCR-038 tumors,
although the inhibition of cell proliferation was similar in
the three PDXs. This could be related to the slower growth
rate of CCR-038 compared to the other two models.
At the molecular level, impaired tumor growth in the
three PDXs treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor correlates
with downregulation of the chemokines CXCL-1 and
CXCL-2 and the cytokine IL-6, which are all known to
play key roles in colon tumorigenesis [29, 33, 40]. These
effects could be mediated by the regulation of IL-6 and
CXCL1/2 mRNA stability by p38α [41]. Regulation of the
IL-6/STAT3 pathway by p38α impinges upon tumor cell
proliferation and survival in mouse models of colon cancer
[20]. Our results extend this observation and suggest an
important role for p38α in the regulation of IL-6/STAT3
signaling in human colon tumors. In contrast, IL-11 can
also induce STAT3 activation [42], but it does not seem
to be affected by p38 MAPK inhibition in these models.
Only PH797804-treated CCR-038 tumors show a small
increase in IL-11 mRNA levels, which does not correlate
with changes in STAT3 phosphorylation, cell proliferation
or apoptosis, suggesting that IL-11 is not produced at high
enough levels to engage STAT3 activation. Inhibition of
p38 MAPK in the PDXs also results in increased JNK
activation, which is consistent with the implication of
sustained JNK activation in apoptosis [15, 34]. However,
we could detect no changes in the expression of the JNK
target genes c-JUN, p16INK4a and BIM between vehicle
and PH797804-treated PDXs (data not shown), suggesting
that the observed JNK activation does not result in general
gene expression changes. Expression analysis of Bcl-2
family proteins suggests that the mechanism by which
p38α regulates tumor cell survival, probably varies
depending on the colon tumor type.
The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 has been
reported to impair the proliferation of human colon cancer
cell lines in vitro and in mouse xenografts, which has
been correlated with autophagy induction and increased
expression of HER-3 and GABARAP [23, 25]. However,
in agreement with other studies [43], our results indicate
that the induction of autophagic vacuoles is a p38 MAPKindependent effect of SB202190. Moreover, neither
GABARAP nor HER-3 mRNAs were consistently
upregulated upon p38 MAPK inhibition in the PDXs

Mouse models with genetically or chemicallyinduced colon tumors have greatly enriched our knowledge
of the basic biology of CRC but these models usually lack
the complexity of the human tumors. Moreover, murine
tumors might not truly represent the therapeutic response
of human tumors. To complement the studies with mouse
models, assays based on human cancer cell lines have been
used for decades as preclinical models for the screening
of novel cancer therapeutics. However, human cancer
cell lines cultured in vitro or grown in mice as xenografts
have also limitations, including reduced intra-tumoral
heterogeneity, modest diversity of molecular subtypes
and lack of human stromal cells [35]. To overcome these
limitations, attempts have been made to establish PDXs
from several types of tumors [10-13, 35]. Since PDXs are
derived directly from patient tumor samples with minimal
in vitro manipulation, they are expected to provide a
more accurate depiction of human tumors. In agreement
with previous reports [11, 35], we have confirmed that
PDXs from CRC retain key histopathological and K-Ras
mutational status of human tumors, suggesting they are
histologically and genetically stable in mice and thus serve
as a model system for testing new therapeutics. Indeed, the
effect of drugs on PDXs from colorectal and pancreatic
tumors has been reported to correlate notably with clinical
outcome, both in terms of drug resistance and sensitivity
[11, 13]. Collectively, PDXs seem closer to the clinical
setting and therefore we have used them to investigate the
effect of p38 MAPK inhibition on the growth of human
colon tumors.
There is good evidence that p38α can function as a
tumor suppressor in several mouse models of cancer [17,
18, 20, 22, 36]. It should be noted that all these studies
have been performed by genetic deletion of p38α before
the tumors are induced, which is not the usual scenario
in clinical practice. Interestingly, genetic deletion or
pharmacological inhibition of p38α have revealed protumorigenic roles of this signaling pathway in breast and
colon cancer models [20, 23, 37, 38] therefore supporting
the use of p38 MAPK inhibitors for the treatment of these
tumors. In the case of colon cancer, the studies were done
using chemically-induced mouse tumors or human cell
lines subcutaneously implanted into nude mice, which
may not truly reflect the human tumor conditions as
discussed above. Thus additional studies using a closer
setting to the clinical situation were needed to confirm the
role of p38 MAPK signaling in colon tumor progression.
We have used three PDXs models from CRC with
different characteristics and have found that tumor growth
is substantially retarded upon p38 MAPK inhibition in
the three cases. K-Ras mutation plays a significant role
in the prognosis of patients with advanced CRC and can
affect the response to Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibodybased therapy that improves overall and progressionwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and our studies with cancer cell lines suggest that longterm incubation with DMSO or high cell confluency may
induce HER-3 and GABARAP independently of p38
MAPK signaling.
Taken together, our studies with PDXs from CRC
extend previous reports using human colon cancer
cell lines or AOM/DSS-induced mouse colon tumors,
and support the potential interest of using p38 MAPK
inhibitors for CRC treatment. Along this line, enhanced
levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK have been detected in
human colon tumors [44] and a recent report that analyzed
by immunohistochemical staining the p38 MAPK
activation status in 316 CRC patients, concluded that high
phospho-p38 MAPK levels predict worse prognosis for
CRC [45]. The inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling has been
also reported to sensitize human colon and breast cancer
cells to apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic drugs
such as cisplatin and FOLFIRI [26, 38, 44, 46]. These
studies are encouraging but are mainly based on the use of
established cell lines in vitro or in xenografts. Therefore,
p38 MAPK inhibitors combined with chemotherapeutic
drugs or other therapies should be rigorously tested for
accuracy and reproducibility in PDXs from several
patients, ideally using a panel of human tumors that
represent the heterogeneity observed in the clinic.

embedded. The other two pieces were snap frozen for
RNA and protein analysis. Mice were housed according to
national and EU regulations and protocols were approved
by the animal care and use committee of SEA-PCB. Mice
were housed in a temperature-controlled facility using
individually ventilated cages, standard diet and a 12-h
light/dark cycle. Human material was donated following
all the guidelines established in the protocol approved by
the IRB of reference (CEIC-Grupo Hospital de Madrid).

MATERIALs AND METHODS

The inhibitor of p38α and p38β MAPKs PH797804
[27] was obtained from Selleckchem (#S2726) and was
dissolved in PBS containing 0.5% Methyl cellulose
(Sigma #M7140) and 0.025% Tween 20 (Sigma #P1379)
at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Mice were weighted and a
daily dose of 10 mg/kg body weight was administered by
oral gavage for 10 consecutive days for the PDX CCR010 and CCR-024 and 16 consecutive days for CCR-038.
Control mice were similarly administered vehicle (PBS
with 0.5% Methyl cellulose and 0.025% Tween 20).

K-Ras mutation analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from snap frozen
tumor tissues using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN
#51304). Samples were diluted to 100 ng/µl and PCR
was performed using the following primers for K-Ras:
Forward GGCCTGCTGAAAATGACTGA; Reverse
GTCCTGCACCAGTAATATGC. PCR products were
purified using DNA clean & ConcentratorTM kit (ZYMO
Research #D4006) and sequenced using forward and
reverse primers. Mutations were detected by observing
individual chromatograms.

p38 MAPK inhibition in mice

Generation of PDXs from colorectal tumors
PDXs were generated as described previously
[14]. Briefly, tumor tissue specimens were cut into
2- to 3-mm3 pieces in antibiotic-containing RPMI
medium. Non-necrotic tumor pieces were selected
and immersed in Matrigel (BD Biosciences #354234).
Under anesthesia with isoflurane, one tumor piece was
implanted subcutaneously by a small incision in each
side of the lower back into 5-6 weeks old female athymic
Nude-Foxn1nu mice (Harlan Laboratories). Tumors were
harvested when they reached a size of 1500 mm3 (Px1
xenografts). Xenografts from Px1 mice were divided
into small pieces (approx. 3 mm3) and then implanted
again subcutaneously as described above to obtain Px2
xenografts. This process was further repeated and the
experiments were performed on xenografts between Px3
and Px6. For the experiments, xenografts were allowed to
grow until they reached a size of 150-200 mm3 and then
mice were randomized into two groups for the treatment as
described below. Tumor size was measured twice a week
by a digital caliper using the following formula: Tumor
volume = (length × width2)/2. At the end of the treatment,
tumors were harvested and divided in three pieces. One
tumor piece was fixed in 10% formalin solution (Sigma,
#HT-501128) at RT for 24 h and then was paraffinwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Histochemical staining
Paraffin-embedded tumor sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed by
pathologists in blinded fashion for tumor grading.
Immunostainings were performed using antibodies
against CD-56 (Abcam #ab8233; 1:50, overnight 4ºC),
BrdU (BD Biosciences #347580; 1:100, 1 h RT), Ki67
(Novocastra, #Ki67P-CE, 1:1000, 1 h RT) and cleaved
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661; 1:200, 1 h RT). The
secondary antibodies used were HRP conjugated antirabbit (ImmunoLogic #DPVR110HRP, 45 min at RT),
anti-mouse (Dako #P0447; 1:100, 30 min at RT) and
anti-rat (Dako #P0450; 1:75, 30 min at RT). Signals
were visualized with DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine), using
hematoxylin as a counterstaining.
Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent was used to
detect mucus-secreting cells. Slides were incubated with

Oncotarget

an aqueous solution of 1% periodic acid for 10 min at
RT, followed by incubation with Schiff’s reagent (Merck,
HX383284) for 20 min. Hematoxylin staining was used
as a counterstain.

Mcl-1(#5453; 1:600), Bak (#3814; 1:1000), Bax (#2772;
1:1000) from Cell Signaling; phospho-JNK (#C12541;
1:500) from BD; Hsp27 (#SC-1049; 1:700) from Santa
Cruz. Tubulin (Sigma #T9026) or GAPDH (Sigma
#G8795) were used as loading controls. After three washes
with PBS, membranes were incubated with Alexa Fluor
680 or 800-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen;
1:5000) for 1 h at RT and were visualized using Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor, Biosciences).

Proliferation and apoptosis analysis
For proliferation, BrdU (Roche #10280879001) was
intraperitoneally injected (1 mg /10 g body weight) and 2
h later the mice were sacrificed and sections were stained
with BrdU antibody. Consecutive sections were also
stained with the Ki67 antibody to confirm the proliferation
index. For apoptosis, sections were stained with antibody
for cleaved caspase 3. Proliferation and apoptosis levels
were determined by counting the number of positive cells
and the total number of cells in at least eight random fields
at 20x magnification.

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from tumor pieces or
cultured cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) or PureLink RNA
mini kit (Ambion #12183018A). After DNase I treatment
(Roche #04716728001), total RNA (1-2 µg) was reverse
transcribed using a Super script II Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen #18064-014) and Random primers (Invitrogen
#48190-011). qRT-PCR was performed in triplicates using
4 µl of 1/12 diluted cDNA and SYBR green (Bio-Rad
#1708886) in 20 µl total volume on a Bio-Rad C1000
thermal cycler machine. Relative quantities (∆ cycle
threshold values) were obtained by normalizing against
GAPDH. The primers used are listed in the Supplemental
Table.

Cell culture
Human colon cancer cell lines HT-29, Caco-2 and
DLD-1 were provided by Gavin Whissell and Eduard
Batlle (Colorectal cancer laboratory, IRB Barcelona) and
were expanded, tested for mycoplasma contamination
and then frozen in vials that were directly used for
experiments. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. The p38α and p38β MAPK inhibitors
SB202190 (10 µM) and PH797804 (2 µM) were used to
treat cells. To induce p38 MAPK activation, cells were
UV-treated (60 J/m2) and collected 45 min later.

Statistical methods
Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical
significance was determined by Student’s t test or by twoway ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test for PDX tumor
growth curves using GraphPad Prism 4 software. p values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
