Abstract
Although in vivo targeting of tumors using ﬂuorescently labeled probes has greatly gained in importance
over the last few years, most of the clinically applied reagents lack tumor cell speciﬁcity. Our novel tumor
cell–penetrating peptide-based probe (TPP) recognizes an epitope of Hsp70 that is exclusively present on the
cell surface of a broad variety of human and mouse tumors and metastases, but not on normal tissues.
Because of the rapid turnover rate of membrane Hsp70, ﬂuorescently labeled TPP is continuously internalized
into syngeneic, spontaneous, chemically/genetically induced and xenograft tumors following intravenous
administration, thereby enabling site-speciﬁc labeling of primary tumors and metastases. In contrast with the
commercially available nonpeptide small molecule avb3-integrin antagonist IntegriSense, TPP exhibits a
signiﬁcantly higher tumor-to-background contrast and stronger tumor-speciﬁc signal intensity in all tested
tumor models. Moreover, in contrast with IntegriSense, TPP reliably differentiates between tumor cells and
cells of the tumor microenvironment, such as tumor-associated macrophages and ﬁbroblasts, which were
found to be membrane-Hsp70 negative. Therefore, TPP provides a useful tool for multimodal imaging of
tumors and metastases that might help to improve our understanding of tumorigenesis and allow the
establishment of improved diagnostic procedures and more accurate therapeutic monitoring. TPP might also
be a promising platform for tumor-speciﬁc drug delivery and other Hsp70-based targeted therapies. Cancer

Introduction
Tumor targeting peptides represent a promising new class of
prognostic tools due to their advantageous biodistribution
with fast body clearance and their capacity to effectively
penetrate viable cells (1–3). However, it is essential that such
probes exhibit speciﬁc binding to tumor cells and exclude
normal tissue. The identiﬁcation of tumor-selective probes is
therefore essential.
In addition to its physiologic, stress-induced appearance in the cytoplasm, HSP70 (Hsp70-1, HspA1A, #3303)
has been found to be selectively localized on the plasma

membrane of a broad variety of different murine and
human tumors. Because of its absence in the membranes
of normal cells, targeting membrane Hsp70 on tumors
offers unique opportunities for the detection, screening,
and staging of diseases (4–7), as well as for drug development and treatment evaluation of a wide variety of neoplasms in future theranostic approaches (8–10).
Screening of tumor biopsies and their corresponding
normal tissues of well over 1,000 patients has shown that
the majority of the primarily diagnosed carcinoma samples,
but none of the tested corresponding normal tissues,
exhibited an Hsp70-membrane–positive phenotype (5). Furthermore, we have previously shown that Hsp70-membrane
positivity is increased in stressed tumor cells that also
exhibit elevated cytosolic Hsp70 levels. In the cytosol,
Hsp70 acts in an antiapoptotic manner and enhances
survival of the tumor cells following therapies such as
chemo- and radiotherapy (11). Most importantly, an
Hsp70-membrane–positive tumor phenotype has been
shown to be associated with a signiﬁcantly decreased
overall survival in cancerous diseases such as leukemia
(12), lung, breast (13), lower rectal carcinomas (14), prostate (8), and liver cancer (15). These ﬁndings demonstrate
that Hsp70 positivity might serve as a useful marker for
prediction of clinical outcome. The potential therapeutic
value of membrane Hsp70 has been demonstrated in a

previous study that reported on the generation of an
Hsp70-speciﬁc antibody termed cmHsp70.1 to speciﬁcally
induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumor
cells in vitro and in vivo (16, 17).
Herein, we describe a novel peptide-based probe that
binds to membrane Hsp70. Because of its remarkable tumor
speciﬁcity and capacity for internalization (18), this probe
has been termed Hsp70 tumor cell–penetrating peptide
(TPP). TPP, which comprises the amino acid sequence
aa450–463 (TKDNNLLGRFELSG) of the C-terminal oligomerization domain of Hsp70, binds to tumor cells with high
afﬁnity in vivo as well as in vitro. The speciﬁcity of TPP
toward Hsp70 was shown by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. S1).
As recently shown by Mahalka and colleagues (19), the
C-terminal and N-terminal domain of Hsp70 are exposed
to the extracellular milieu of tumor cells if presented on the
plasma membrane. Although in vitro TPP exhibits similar
binding characteristics toward Hsp70 than the cmHsp70.1
monoclonal antibody (16, 17), TPP exerts a better biodistribution, in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Animals
BALB/c, FvB, and SHO-PrkdcscidHrHr (SHO) mice were
obtained from an animal breeding colony (Charles River and
Harlan Winkelmann) and were maintained in pathogen-free,
individually ventilated cages (Tecniplast). All animal experiments were approved by the District Government of Upper
Bavaria and performed in accordance with the German Animal
Welfare and Ethical Guidelines of the Klinikum rechts der Isar,
TUM, Munich, Germany. Tumors were examined after the
animals were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation.
Syngeneic tumor models
CT26 mouse colon adenocarcinoma cells (5  105) or 4T1
mammary carcinoma cells (2.5  105; ATCC, authentication
not applicable for mouse cell lines) were harvested in the
exponential growth phase and injected subcutaneously in the
neck or orthotopically into the mammary fad pad of 8-weekold, female BALB/c mice, respectively. Primary tumor growth
was followed by ultrasonic measurements (Logiq-5, GE Healthcare). Intraoperative in vivo imaging was performed post
mortem on exposed tumors when the CT26 tumors reached
a size of approximately 0.4 cm3. 4T1-derived tumors and lung
metastases were investigated after 25 to 30 days of tumor
growth.
Xenograft tumor models
To test the capacity of TPP to recognize human tumors,
5  106 cells from the following human carcinoma cell
lines were implanted subcutaneously into the neck area or
orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of 8- to 10-weekold, female SHO mice: colon carcinoma cell lines HCT-116
(ATCC) and CX-2 (DKFZ), mammary carcinoma cell lines
MCF-7, MDA-MB231 and T-47D (ATCC), pancreas carcinoma cell lines Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2 (provided by J.T. Siveke)
and COLO357 (Leibniz-Institute DSMZ, Braunschweig,

Germany), small-cell lung cancer H1339, non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 (n.t.), head and neck carcinoma
FaDu (all ATCC) and Cal-33 (Leibniz-Institute DSMZ), as
well as the human cervix carcinoma HeLa (ATCC). Mice
were sacriﬁced and intraoperative in vivo imaging was
performed on the exposed tumors when tumors had
reached a volume of 0.2 to 0.4 cm3. If not stated otherwise,
cell line authentication was performed by short tandem
repeat proﬁles that are generated by simultaneous ampliﬁcation of multiple short tandem repeat loci by ATCC and
DSMZ. Cells were not cultured for longer than 5 months
after testing.
Colitis-associated spontaneous tumor model
Spontaneous colonic tumors were induced in 8-weekold female FvB mice (Charles River) using an established
approach. Brieﬂy, mice were injected intraperitoneally with
a single dose of azoxymethane (AOM; Sigma-Aldrich) at
10 mg/kg body weight. Following AOM treatment, the mice
were subjected to three cycles of dextran sulfate sodium salt
(MP Biomedicals) administration in their drinking water
(20). After 15 to 18 weeks of tumor development, the mice
were sacriﬁced and the colon was resected for experiments.
The presence of colorectal tumors was conﬁrmed using
standard histologic techniques.
Endogenous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma mouse
model
The spontaneous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) mouse model (Ptf1aþ/Cre;Krasþ/LSL-G12D;p53LoxP/LoxP,
CKP) has been described previously (21). After sacriﬁcing, the
abdominal cavity of tumor-bearing mice, including the pancreas, was exposed for in vivo imaging of the tumor area and
surrounding normal tissue.
Toxicity testing
Potential toxic effects of TPP were investigated by injecting
healthy BALB/c mice intravenously with 500 and 1050 mg of
TPP. Concentrations up to 500 mg of TPP per mouse were
tested in tumor-bearing mice (s.c. tumors, size 0.4 cm3). The
health status and the general behavior of mice were inspected.
Animals were sacriﬁced on day 5 and the heart, liver, spleen,
lung, and kidneys examined for pathologic changes using
standard histologic techniques.
Flow cytometry
The membrane-Hsp70 phenotype of tumors grown in vivo
was determined by ﬂow-cytometric analysis of single cell
suspensions that were generated following 30 minutes collagenase/dispase digestion using FITC-conjugated cmHsp70.1
mAb (IgG1, multimmune GmbH) or carboxyﬂuorescein-conjugated TPP (TPP[CF]). Cell suspensions were incubated with
the appropriate reagent for 30 minutes at 4 C, after which they
were washed and viable (7-AAD negative) cells were analyzed
using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Gating was applied to distinguish the CD45/CD140b tumor cell
population from CD45/CD140bþ ﬁbroblasts and CD45þ/F4/
80þ macrophages.

In Vivo Imaging of Tumors Using an Hsp70 Peptide-Based Probe

TPP, control peptide, and IntegriSense 750 in imaging
procedures
In in vivo imaging experiments, Cy5.5 or DyLight750-conjugated Hsp70-speciﬁc 14-mer TPP (OEM manufactured by
Thermo Fischer) was compared with the unspeciﬁc scrambled
control peptide (CP, OEM manufactured by Thermo Fischer)
and with IntegriSense 750 (IS750, PerkinElmer; Supplementary
Fig. S2). The intraoperative imaging procedure, which captured
color and ﬂuorescence images of the exposed tumors and its
surrounding normal tissue, was conﬁgured to simulate an
intraoperative imaging situation. TPP[Cy5.5] or CP[DL750]
(100 mg, equal to 45 nmol per animal) or IS750, at the recommended dose of 2 nmol per animal, was injected into the tail
vein of tumor-bearing mice. Concentrations above 2 nmol
resulted in a higher staining of healthy tissues and thus
negatively affected the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR; data
not shown). Signal speciﬁcity was determined by calculating
the ratio of the mean signal intensity in the exposed tumor
tissue and that of the surrounding normal tissue (TBR; ref. 22).
Kinetic studies were performed 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after
tail vein bolus injection of TPP[Cy5.5] and CP[DL750]. All other
experiments were performed 24 hours after intravenous injection of the respective probes.
Fluorescent images were acquired by illuminating the specimens using 670 and 740 nm diode lasers and guiding the
emitted ﬂuorescence through appropriate emission ﬁlters
before capturing it using a back illuminated EM-CCD camera
(iXon DU888, Andor), as described previously (16). A more
detailed description of the imaging procedures is shown in the
Supplementary Section.
Biodistribution studies
For biodistribution, tumor-bearing mice were sacriﬁced 12,
24, or 48 hours after intravenous injection of TPP[Cy5.5].
Fluorescent signal intensities of 0.25 cm3 tissue cubes, taken
from the tumor, spleen, pancreas, liver, lung, duodenum,
kidney, heart, and 0.25 mL of peripheral blood were measured
as described above. Agarose-gel cubes with standardized concentrations were used to calculate the probe concentrations in
the investigated tissue samples. Detailed information concerning the quantiﬁcation of TPP[Cy5.5] is provided in Supplementary Fig. S6.
Histology, IHC, and ﬂuorescence microscopy
Paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections (2 mm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin using
standard procedures. For IHC on cryosections, unspeciﬁc
mouse-on-mouse reactions were blocked using a M.O.M. kit
(Vector Labs) and stained with cmHsp70.1 mAb following
antigen retrieval in citrate buffer. The quantiﬁcation and
volumetric analysis of lung metastases were performed using
consecutive tissue sections (100 mm) using Aperio ImageScope
software (Leica).
For microscopic in situ ﬂuorescence analysis, TPP[CF] (100
mg) and the recommended dose of IntegriSense 750 (IS[750])
were injected intravenously into tumor-bearing mice and
allowed to circulate for 24 hours. Tissue was collected
and 8 mm cryosections counterstained with DAPI (DAKO) and

www.aacrjournals.org

examined microscopically using a Zeiss Observer Z1
(Carl Zeiss) equipped with standard ﬁlters for GFP and Cy7
after 4 minutes of ﬁxation with 1.8% w/v PFA.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t test.
Data are mean  SD. P values  0.05 were considered as being
signiﬁcant different between the compared groups.

Results
The membrane-bound form of Hsp70, but not
b3-integrin, is present on a wide variety of human
and murine tumors
To examine the presence of the investigated reporter epitopes on cells in vivo, a broad variety of murine and human
tumors were screened for the presence of membrane Hsp70 and
b3-integrin (CD61), the target epitopes for TPP and IntegriSense, respectively. This screening included colon, mammary,
pancreatic, lung, head and neck, and cervical carcinomas
derived from syngeneic, chemically induced, spontaneous and
xenograft mouse models. Flow-cytometric analysis of viable
cells derived from the solid tumors demonstrated that all of the
cells examined exhibited a comparable membrane Hsp70 staining pattern using the cmHsp70.1 monoclonal antibody or the
TPP probe (Fig. 1; Table 1). This ﬁnding further emphasizes the
fact that targeting membrane Hsp70 could serve as a universal
approach for diagnosing a wide variety of tumor entities.
For ﬂow-cytometric analysis, a cell population was deﬁned
to be membrane positive if as more than 20% of the cells were
stained. The threshold of 20% was deﬁned upon screening of a
large panel of healthy human tissues, including human peripheral blood lymphocytes, ﬁbroblast, and healthy tissues surrounding tumor (n ¼ 86). CD61 staining revealed avb3-integrin
positivity on mouse colon (CT26) and mammary (4T1) carcinoma, on human mammary (MDA-MB231, T-47D) and head
and neck (CAL-33) carcinoma, as well as on human and mouse
pancreatic carcinoma (PDAC, Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2, COLO357).
However, no b3-integrin expression could be detected on
human colon (HCT-116, CX-2), mammary (MCF-7), lung
(H-1339), or cervical (HeLa) carcinoma cells. Cells derived
from a murine colitis-associated carcinoma (CAC) model
showed a heterogeneous CD61 expression. These data indicate
that, in comparison with b3-integrin, Hsp70 is more frequently
expressed on human and murine tumors. However, tumor cell
speciﬁcity is critical for targeting strategies. Therefore, the
presence of membrane Hsp70 and b3-integrin on tumor-residing CD45þ/F4/80þ macrophages and CD45/CD140bþ ﬁbroblasts was investigated. TPP only weakly stains (below 10%)
tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts and tumor-inﬁltrating macrophages; in contrast, b3-integrin positivity was found on more
than 60% of tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts and tumor-inﬁltrating macrophages (Fig. 1B). To test Hsp70 positivity on tumors,
cryosections were stained with the Hsp70-speciﬁc antibody
cmHsp70.1. Although tumor cells of the various tumor models
were positive, cells of the tumor microenvironment remained
negative for Hsp70. A representative staining of a PDAC tumor
is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.

TPP remained signiﬁcantly lower in macrophages (P ¼ 1.54  10 ) and ﬁbroblasts (P ¼ 4.67  10 ), compared with b3-integrin. Averaged tumor cell
positivity revealed no signiﬁcant difference between TPP and b3-integrin staining.

TPP is not toxic in vivo
To examine potential toxic side effects of TPP, healthy and
tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with
500 to 1,050 mg of TPP, which is equivalent to 25 to 50 mg/g of
their body weight. Gross monitoring of the mice did not show
any toxic reactions such as skin ulcerations or toxic death at
any of the tested doses. Nor did any animal exhibit any loss of
weight or change in mobility. Histologic examination of the
heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney on day 5 after injection by a
veterinarian, revealed no pathologic changes. An examination
of the effects of TPP concentrations up to 500 mg in tumorbearing mice also did not exert any side effects.
TPP accumulates within the tumor with maximal
speciﬁcity 24 hours postintravenous injection
To investigate the in vivo circulation and tumor-homing
properties of TPP, we analyzed its biodistribution in CT26
tumor-bearing mice. The accumulation of TPP in different
organs was determined 12, 24, and 48 hours after intravenous
injection of 100 mg TPP[Cy5.5] by measuring ﬂuorescent signal
intensities in the tumor, spleen, pancreas, liver, lung, duodenum, kidney, heart, and in the peripheral blood (Fig. 2).

6906

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

A strong TPP[Cy5.5] signal could be detected within the tumor
(7.6  0.7 mg/cm3) 12 hours after intravenous injection. This
reached a maximum after 24 hours (10.4  2.2 mg/cm3) and
dropped after 48 hours. TPP accumulation was signiﬁcantly
lower at all investigated time points in all other tested
organs, except the kidney. The concentration of TPP[Cy5.5]
reached its maximum in the kidney after 12 hours at 13.7
 0.6 mg/cm3, and this accumulation was followed by a sharp
drop, 24 and 48 hours postinjection. These data further conﬁrm
the tumor speciﬁcity of TPP and indicate that TPP is cleared
from the body by renal excretion.
In further experiments, we investigated the optimal time
point for in vivo imaging in a CT26 tumor model (subcutaneously) 2 weeks after tumor injection (Supplementary Fig. S5A)
and a metastasizing 4T1 mammary carcinoma model (orthotopically) 3 to 4 weeks after tumor injection (Supplementary
Figs. S5B and S5C and S7). TPP[Cy5.5] yielded maximal TBR
in primary tumors 24 hours after injection of the probe,
whereas the peak TBR in metastasized lungs occurred after
48 hours. The scrambled control peptide CP[DL750] did not
show any speciﬁc accumulation in tumor tissue (Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C).

24 hours before in vivo imaging. Although TPP[Cy5.5] and
IS[750] both clearly delineate the tumor, IS[750] signals can
also be found in normal tissue surrounding the tumor (Fig. 3A
and B, true color images of the region of interest is depicted
on the left). TPP[Cy5.5] exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher TBR
than IS[750] (P ¼ 0.0004 and 0.003, respectively). To further
investigate the speciﬁcity of the probes, ex vivo imaging of
dissected lungs containing metastases was performed. Quantiﬁcation of metastases can be found in Supplementary Fig. S4.
The TBR for IS[750] imaging was also lower than that for
TPP[Cy5.5] (P ¼ 0.04; Fig. 3C, bottom) in distant lesions.
Although the delineation of metastases by TPP[Cy5.5] and
IS[750] was comparable, the enrichment of IS[750] in normal
lung tissue is marginally higher (Fig. 3C, top). The speciﬁcity
and colocalization of TPP and IS was further conﬁrmed on
cryo-sections of the lesions, which were obtained 24 hours
after intravenous injection of TPP[CF] and IS[750] (Fig. 3D).
Both probes speciﬁcally enriched in the primary tumor and
lung metastases, however, a background staining of IS[750]
remained in healthy lung tissue. These data demonstrate that,
although both compounds speciﬁcally stain tumors and
metastases, TPP is more effectively washed out of normal
tissue and therefore provides a better signal-to-background
contrast than IntegriSense.
The speciﬁc tumor-homing capacity of TPP is higher
than that of IntegriSense in endogenous tumor models
To more realistically mimic the histologic and molecular
features of human tumors in in vivo imaging, we took advantage of chemically induced and endogenous mouse models of
colorectal (CAC) and pancreatic (PDAC) cancer. Flow-

Hsp70 is rapidly endocytosed in tumor cells under physiologic
conditions (18) provides an explanation for the cytosolic
staining pattern of tumors.

(Panc-1, MiaPaCa-2, COLO357) in our experiment. These
models revealed substantial Hsp70 and b3-integrin positivity
(Table 1; Fig. 1). Although IS[750] produced higher TBRs in
the pancreatic tumors compared with the other xenograft
models that were examined, TPP[Cy5.5] yielded signiﬁcantly
higher ratios in two of these three models [P ¼ 0.04 (Panc-1)
and P ¼ 0.03 (COLO357)].
Other human carcinoma cell lines that were determined
as being b3-integrin positive were T-47D, MDA-MB-231
(mammary carcinomas), and Cal-33 (squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; see Table 1). The TBRs of IS[750]
ﬂuorescence of T-47D and Cal-33 also were signiﬁcantly
lower than the TBRs for TPP[Cy5.5] (P ¼ 0.04 and 0.02,
respectively). The TBR for IS[750] in all b3-integrin negative
tumors remained clearly below the TBRs for TPP[750]. These
data indicate that TPP might be a powerful tumor targeting
agent for the detection, diagnosis, and targeting of several
entities in humans.

The uptake capacities of TPP and IntegriSense were
also investigated using an endogenous pancreatic PDAC
model, which has an activating mutation in the Kras oncogene concomitant with a deletion of the tumor suppressor
Tp53 (21). Tumor cells of this model exhibited strong
membrane positivity of both Hsp70 and b3-integrin
(Table 1). Imaging of the pancreatic tumors was performed
after opening of the peritoneal cavity; the stomach, liver,
and gut were used to calculate the background ﬂuorescence. The TBR for TPP[Cy5.5] was signiﬁcantly higher
than that of the control peptide (P ¼ 0.0001) and comparable with that of the integrin avb3-targeting compound
IS[750] (Fig. 4C). Figure 4D shows ﬂuorescence images of a
cryo-sliced pancreatic tumors 24 hours after simultaneous
injection of TPP[CF] and IS[750]. Although both compounds
stained tumor cells equally (left, white arrows), cells of the
tumor microenvironment showed a weaker staining with
TPP[CF] (right).
TPP has a higher capacity to speciﬁcally target human
xenograft tumors than IntegriSense
To conﬁrm the tumor homing capacities of TPP[Cy5.5] in
human tumors, imaging experiments were performed in 13
different human tumor cell lines derived from six entities
(colon, mammary, pancreas, head and neck, cervix, and
lung; Fig. 5). The TBRs for TPP[Cy5.5] in the xenograft
tumors ranged from 5.6  1.6 (mammary carcinoma cell
line, MDA-MB231) to 7.8  1.4 (squamous cell carcinoma
cell line of the head and neck, Cal-33), all of which were
signiﬁcantly higher than those of CP[DL750]. This indicates
a speciﬁc enrichment of TPP[Cy5.5] in all of the investigated
xenograft tumors. Because it is known that the majority of
human pancreatic carcinomas are positive for b3-integrin
(22), we included three pancreas tumor xenograft models

Discussion
Interest in the use of peptides as innovative cancer diagnostic and tumor-speciﬁc drug delivery tools has increased
(1–3). However, one of the most critical issues in cancer
detection using tumor-targeting probes is speciﬁcity, as most
of the recently used markers also bind to tumor-associated
stroma and other cells. Despite many reports on tumor markers in oncology, the number of clinically useful, tumor-speciﬁc
markers with prognostic relevance remains low (23–26). It was
shown that membrane Hsp70 is present on nearly all aggressive
tumor cells from a wide variety of murine and human tumor
entities (4–8, 11–15). Therefore, membrane Hsp70 is of prognostic value and fulﬁlls the criteria for an effective tumor
targeting molecule.

In Vivo Imaging of Tumors Using an Hsp70 Peptide-Based Probe

Given the widespread expression of membrane Hsp70 in
different tumor entities and its prognostic relevance, this study
evaluated TPP as a tumor homing peptide probe in a wide
range of murine and human tumor models. TPP was shown to
be highly speciﬁc (18) and is therefore an extremely useful tool
for in vivo tumor detection and diagnosis. Targeting membrane
Hsp70 with TPP is advantageous due to its rapid intracellular
uptake, biodistribution, and tumor cell–selective accumulation. Similar to Hsp70, an ectopic and tumor-selective expression of Hsp90 has been utilized for the internalization of optical
and radioiodinated tethered Hsp90 inhibitors (27).
The use of a colitis-associated colon carcinoma (20) and an
endogenous pancreatic tumor model (21) allowed ample mimicking of the human situation in terms of tumor morphology
and microenvironment, whereas the xenograft models of
colon, mammary, pancreas, lung, head and neck, and cervix
carcinoma were used to screen the performance of TPP in
numerous human-derived malignant tumors in vivo. TPP was
able to speciﬁcally detect and penetrate each of the tested
tumors at high yields, in vivo (Figs. 3–5; Supplementary Fig. S7A
and S7B). Furthermore, TPP speciﬁcally stains single cell
suspensions of solid tumors, in vitro (Fig. 1A; Table 1). We
also compared the in vitro and in vivo binding speciﬁcity of
TPP with the neoplastic cells of various tumor models and
nontransformed cells of the tumor stroma with that of a
scrambled control peptide and the commercially available
marker IntegriSense, which has been shown to stain different
tumor entities, including pancreatic cancers, in vivo (28–31).
The TBRs for TPP were higher than that of a control peptide
and IntegriSense for all of the investigated tumors.
Flow-cytometric analysis revealed that the ligand of IntegriSense, b3-integrin, was absent in ﬁve of the 11 human tumor
xenografts, whereas all tested human and murine tumors were
found to be highly membrane-Hsp70 positive (Fig. 1A; Table 1).
To reﬂect the more complex in vivo situation, we broadened
our investigations to non-neoplastic cells of the tumor stroma.
We used ﬂow cytometry to analyze the presence of membrane
Hsp70 and b3-integrin on macrophages and ﬁbroblasts in
single cell suspensions derived from solid tumors. Both cell
types show a low background ﬂuorescence of membraneHsp70 but high b3-integrin positivity (Fig. 1B). Although
macrophages internalize IntegriSense and TPP in vivo, only
a minimal level of TPP staining was detected in tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts. Other studies demonstrated the presence
of integrins, including b3-integrin, on tumor endothelial cells
(32, 33), which were negative for membrane Hsp70 (34).
Another recently discovered tumor targeting strategy
involves the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Similar to Hsp70,
CXCR4 offers the possibility to target different tumor entities.

However, some carcinomas, like the NSCLC, do not or only
weakly express CXCR4 on their plasma membranes (35, 36).
In contrast, Hsp70 is present on all tested NSCLC tumors
(xenograft, primary human tumors; ref. 5). Furthermore,
potential adverse effects of targeting CXCR4, such as the
mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells by CXCR4
antagonists (37), remain to be elucidated.
The current study found no evidence that TPP has any
toxic side effects, even if it was administered at 10-fold higher
doses than those that were used for in vivo imaging. Ex vivo
biodistribution analysis revealed the beneﬁcial tumor-homing capacities of the TPP peptide. Although TPP was effectively washed out of the normal tissue 24 hours after its
administration, pronounced levels remained within the
tumor tissue at this time point (Fig. 2). The small-molecular
weight of TPP ensures that it is cleared via the kidneys and
does not accumulate in the liver like high-molecular weight
targeting probes such as antibodies. As a consequence, TPP
did not result in nonspeciﬁc background signals in the liver.
Therefore, TPP could be used as an imaging probe for
hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases (15).
In conclusion, TPP might be a useful peptide-based marker
for diagnostic tumor targeting, as well as an efﬁcient tool for
drug delivery for a broad variety of human tumors.
