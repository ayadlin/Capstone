BACKGROUND: The importance of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a prognostic and predictive marker in invasive breast cancer is well established. Accurate assessment of HER2 status is essential to determine optimal treatment options.
METHODS: Breast cancer tumor tissue samples from the VIRGO observational cohort tissue substudy that were locally HER2negative were retested centrally with both US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays, using FDA-approved assay cutoffs; results were compared. RESULTS: Of the 552 unique
patient samples centrally retested with local HER2-negative results recorded, tumor samples from 22 (4.0%) patients were determined to be HER2-positive (95% confidence interval [CI] 5 2.5%-5.7%). Of these, 18 had been tested locally by only one testing methodology; 15 of 18 were HER2-positive after the central retesting, based on the testing methodology not performed locally. Compared
with the 530 patients with centrally confirmed HER2-negative tumors, the 22 patients with centrally determined HER2-positive
tumors were younger (median age 56.5 versus 60.0 years) and more likely to have ER/PR-negative tumors (27.3% versus 22.3%).
These patients also had shorter median progression-free survival (6.4 months [95% CI 5 3.8-15.9 months] versus 9.1 months [95%
CI 5 8.3-10.3 months]) and overall survival (25.9 months [95% CI 5 13.8-not estimable] versus 27.9 months [95% CI 5 25.0-32.9
months]). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the limitations of employing just one HER2 testing methodology in current clinical
practice. It identifies a cohort of patients who did not receive potentially efficacious therapy because their tumor HER2-positivity was
not determined by the test initially used. Because of inherent limitations in testing methodologies, it is inadvisable to rely on a single

INTRODUCTION
Overexpression or amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is reported in 15% to 20% of
breast cancers,1,2 and its importance as a prognostic/predictive marker in invasive breast cancer is well established.1,3,4
Prior to the introduction of trastuzumab in the metastatic setting, HER2-positive breast cancer was associated with more
aggressive disease with a poorer prognosis than HER2-negative breast cancer.1-3,5,6 In women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, trastuzumab, in addition to standard adjuvant chemotherapy, significantly improves disease-free survival and overall survival (OS).7-10 Use of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting has been projected to prevent more than

55,000 recurrences over 25 years in the United States.11
In addition, data from randomized clinical trials have consistently shown that treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with HER2-targeted agents
(trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab
emtansine [T-DM1]) has improved clinical outcomes.6,12-16 Thus, accurate determination of tumor
HER2 status is critical in identifying patients most likely
to benefit from HER2-directed therapy, and in avoiding
use of unwarranted or potentially detrimental therapy.1719

HER2 testing is typically performed using either
immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). IHC evaluates receptor protein
expression on the cellular surface and FISH assesses HER2
gene copy number in the nucleus. IHC is scored semiquantitatively as 0, 11, 21, or 31, based on staining intensity,
pattern, and percentage of tumor cells stained.20 FISH
directly examines HER2 gene amplification by use of
fluorescent-labeled nucleic acid probes to enumerate the average number of HER2 gene copies within the nuclei of tumor cells, and is usually scored as a ratio of HER2 signal to
the copy number of chromosome 17 (CEP17).20 According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO)–College of American Pathologists (CAP) HER2
testing guidelines, either test can be used in the determination of HER2 status.20,21 Disagreement as to the most
appropriate HER2 test or test algorithm exists, and the
results of both tests can be affected by technical issues. Several reports have noted discordance between HER2 test
results from local versus large reference laboratories in
patients with locally determined HER2-positive breast cancer evaluated for trastuzumab-based clinical studies.22-25
Most prior studies reporting testing results for patients
with HER2-positive breast cancer have discussed falsepositive results observed, based on central confirmatory
testing. In contrast, there are few published data on the falsenegative rate obtained after examining the concordance of
central and local testing results on locally determined
HER2-negative breast cancer. A better understanding of this
aspect of HER2 testing accuracy is needed, because patients
whose tumors are incorrectly diagnosed as HER2-negative
may forgo the opportunity to potentially benefit from treatment with HER2-directed therapies.
VIRGO is a large, disease-based, observational
cohort study that enrolled 1267 women with primarily
HER2-negative MBC and included an optional tissuebased substudy. Here, we assessed discordance between
local and central HER2 testing in women with HER2negative breast cancer in the tissue substudy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
VIRGO Study Design

VIRGO is a multicenter, prospective observational cohort
study of 1267 women with HER2-negative MBC enrolled between June 2008 and January 2011. Two cohorts
were included: patients with HER2-negative MBC who
were treated with first-line chemotherapy and patients
with hormone receptor–positive MBC (HER2-negative
or -positive) treated with first-line endocrine therapy. The
primary objective of VIRGO was to characterize clinical
outcomes for various subgroups of patients with advanced
breast cancer, as defined by patient clinical and tumor
characteristics and treatment patterns. VIRGO also
included an optional exploratory tissue-based substudy,
for which separate consent for participation was obtained.
Central HER2 testing of tissue samples to examine discordance was not a prespecified analysis.
Enrolled patients received treatment and evaluations
for their advanced breast cancer as determined by their treating physicians, according to the standard of care and clinical
practice at each study site. The VIRGO study design and
protocol were approved by a central institutional review
board and, when necessary, by the institutional review board
at each site. All patients signed an informed consent and authorization to disclose their health information.
Data Collection

At baseline, demographic data, breast cancer–specific history, and prior cancer treatment history (chemotherapy,
surgery, radiation), including metastatic sites and history
and medical history, including cardiovascular risk factors,
concomitant medication use, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, selected laboratory tests,
ejection fraction, or shortening fraction (if performed) were
collected.
After enrollment, data elements were collected at quarterly follow-up visits and included study discontinuation status (including death), treatment status, disease response
status, concomitant medication use, cardiovascular arterial
disease status, interval surgical history, interval radiotherapy
history, protocol-specified (selected) adverse events, and
health economic data (for those who consented).
Definitions

Local HER2 testing refers to the initial testing performed
on the tumor tissue samples that classified their HER2 status. Central HER2 testing refers to the testing performed
in this study. HER2-positivity in central testing was
defined according to FDA-approved assay cutoffs (IHC

Results obtained by central retesting of tumor samples
were compared with local testing results. The discordance
rate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
Tumors with unknown/missing local HER2 status were
excluded from primary analyses. A sensitivity analysis was
performed assessing the impact of including the patients
with centrally HER2-negative tumors with unknown/
missing local HER2 status, assuming their tumors to have
tested HER2-negative locally, on the discordance rate.
Demographics were compared between patients
with centrally HER2-positive tumors and patients with
centrally HER2-negative tumors. Disease-free interval
(DFI) was defined as the interval from the date of the first
diagnosis of breast cancer to metastatic/recurrent diagnosis. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS and
their 95% CIs were calculated for the 2 groups, through
use of the Kaplan-Meier method.

were the same as those used in the pivotal clinical trials of
trastuzumab in the adjuvant HER2-positive breast cancer
setting7,8,10 and are consistent with the updated 2013
ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guidelines.21
HER2 Assays

Available tissue samples were retested centrally with both
FDA-approved HER2 IHC and FISH assays at a single
reference laboratory (Clarient, Aliso Viejo, Calif). The
IHC HercepTest kit was used to determine HER2 protein
expression according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Dako, Carpenteria, Calif). The FISH PathVysion HER2
DNA probe kit/HER2/CEP17 probe mixture (Abbott
Molecular, Des Plaines, Ill) was used to determine HER2
and CEP17 gene copy numbers. Because results obtained
by this central HER2 testing could have had significant
clinical implications affecting treatment decisions, after
ethical consultation, study investigators whose patients
were found to have tumors that tested HER2-positive centrally were informed of the results by certified mail.

Of the 1267 patients enrolled in VIRGO, 776 submitted
samples to the tissue substudy. Of those, 637 unique
patient samples were adequate for central retesting using
both the IHC and FISH assays. Eighty-five samples were
excluded from the analyses described here for reasons outlined in Fig. 1.
Clinical Results

Of the 552 locally HER2-negative unique patient samples that were tested centrally and included in the analysis, 530 were confirmed to be HER2-negative. The
remaining 22 samples (4.0%; 95% CI 5 2.5%-5.7%)
were found to be HER2-positive by central testing. Local
versus central IHC and FISH HER2 testing results for
the discordant cases are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
Only one local laboratory had more than one discordant
case (n 5 2).
Of the 22 centrally determined HER2-positive
tumors, 18 tumors were tested locally by only one testing
methodology (8 by IHC alone and 10 by FISH alone).
Four tumors were tested locally by both IHC and FISH.
Of the 18 tumors tested by one methodology locally, 15
yielded positive results on the testing methodology not
performed locally. In 10 of 15 cases, the central testing
methodology not performed locally was the only HER2positive result. Eleven of 22 centrally determined HER2positive tumors showed discordant IHC and FISH results,
with 7 IHC 31/FISH-negative cases and 4 FISH-positive/IHC 0 or 11 cases. All 7 IHC 31/FISH-negative

cases showed heterogeneous IHC staining with a mixture
of strong, moderate, and weakly stained cells, with the
strong staining component at the 10% cutoff. An example
of a tumor in which there were discordant testing methodology results, potentially due to tumor heterogeneity, is
shown in Fig. 2.
Compared with the 530 patients with centrally
HER2-negative tumors, the 22 patients found to have
centrally HER2-positive tumors were younger (median
age, 56.5 versus 60.0 years, respectively) and more likely
to have estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/
PR)–negative tumors (27.3% versus 22.3%; Table 3).
Patients with centrally HER2-positive tumors were also
more likely to have advanced histologic grade compared
with patients with centrally HER2-negative tumors. For
patients initially diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer
that recurred, 18 patients with centrally determined
HER2-positive tumors (15 patients with stage I through
III breast cancer at time of initial diagnosis and 3 patients
with unknown stage) had a median DFI of 30.4 months
versus 43.1 months for the 399 recurrent patients with
centrally confirmed HER2-negative tumors.
In the first-line MBC setting, 22 patients with centrally determined HER2-positive tumors had shorter median PFS and OS compared with 530 patients with
2660

centrally confirmed HER2-negative tumors (median PFS,
6.4 months [95% CI 5 3.8-15.9 months] versus 9.1
months [95% CI 5 8.3-10.3 months]; median OS, 25.9
months [95% CI 5 13.8-not estimable] versus 27.9
months [95% CI 5 25.0-32.9 months]).
Sensitivity Analyses
Unknown Local HER2 Status

After querying the individual study sites, 49 of 85 tissue
samples excluded from these analyses had unknown local
HER2 status data, likely because of protocol deviations
(Fig. 1). Of these, 48 were centrally determined to
be HER2-negative, and one was unevaluable by central
testing. Assuming these samples to be locally HER2negative, the discordance rate would be 3.7% (22 of 600;
Table 4).
Tumors That Were Locally IHC 21, But Had No
FISH Testing Results

Two patients with centrally HER2-positive tumors had
local IHC 21 results, but no FISH results were reported,
indicating that the local laboratory did not follow the
ASCO/CAP guideline of reflex testing of IHC 21 cases
by FISH. Patient records did not reflect treatment with
HER2-directed therapy at any point. If these 2 patients
are excluded, the discordant rate changes to 3.6% (20 of
550).
DISCUSSION
Accurate determination of HER2 status is critical to
optimize clinical outcomes in patients with breast cancer. To date, most studies reporting discordance in
HER2 testing results between local and central laboratories have focused on the false-positive results. Two prospective substudies from trastuzumab adjuvant trials
(NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831)23,24 revealed discordance rates of 18% and 26%, respectively, when local
HER2-positive samples were retested centrally by IHC
and FISH. After central testing became mandatory in the
NCCTG N9831 trial, an expanded analysis (N 5 2535)
found a lower discordance rate of 12%.25 Another analysis in a community-based setting by Reddy et al determined a false-positive rate of 14% to 16% when locally
tested (by IHC) tumor samples were reexamined by IHC
and FISH at a high-volume, centralized laboratory.19
Because patients whose tumors tested HER2-negative
locally would generally not have been referred to
trastuzumab-based studies and therefore would not have
undergone central retesting, few data on false-negative
rates exist. One exception is the analysis by Reddy et al,

in which tumor samples that were locally determined to
be HER2-negative were also assessed centrally, with a
false-negative rate of 18% to 23% when local IHC
results were compared with central IHC and FISH
results, respectively.19 However, the high false-negative
rate in this study was mainly driven by IHC 21 cases,
which represent 14% to 18% of the observed rate (and

Tumor tissue from 1 of 49 patients with unknown local HER2 status was
unevaluable by central testing.

Figure 3. Estimated number of patients in the United States
diagnosed annually with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumors by local testing, but HER2positive by central testing based on a discordance rate of
4.0%. aBased on American Cancer Society estimates of
N 5 229,060 new cases of breast cancer in 2012 and 80%
HER2-negative.

552 unique tumor samples initially found to be HER2negative by local testing were determined to be HER2positive upon central retesting. For these 22 samples, 18
were tested locally using only one testing methodology,
and 15 of 18 yielded positive results using a testing methodology not performed locally.
Patients with tumors found to be HER2-positive
on central retesting had clinical characteristics (shorter
DFI and PFS) consistent with those of the overall
HER2-positive population. Using the discordant rate
calculated in this analysis (4%) to extrapolate to the
larger population of breast cancer cases, if one assumes
there were 229,060 new cases of invasive breast cancer
2662

diagnosed in the United States in 2012,26 and 80% of
those cases are HER2-negative based on local test results,
the total number of patients potentially misdiagnosed
would be 7330 (range, 4581-10,445) (Fig. 3). Based on
World Health Organization global breast cancer incidence estimates,27 these results translate into 53,440
(range, 33,400–76,152) newly diagnosed patients annually worldwide who may forgo the opportunity to potentially benefit from HER2-directed therapies.
There are several potential reasons for discordant
HER2 testing results between laboratories. For example, a
laboratory may not be using a properly validated assay(s)
or the assay procedure may be altered from manufacturer’s
instructions, which can lead to inaccurate results. In addition, samples with tumor heterogeneity may lead to discrepant results.28,29 In this study, 50% of the 22
discrepant local versus central cases showed discordant
centrally determined IHC and FISH results, possibly due
to tumor heterogeneity. Interestingly, 6 of 7 IHC 31/
FISH-negative cases had a FISH ratio of approximately
1.0 but HER2 gene copy numbers > 2, which could be
the result of polysomy or coamplification of both the
HER2 gene and centromere region. Tumor heterogeneity
has also been reported in other studies. For example, in a
round-robin study evaluating HER2 testing of 389 tumor
blocks from 3 large adjuvant trials (NCCTG N9831,
BCIRG-006, and BCIRG-005) performed among 3 separate central laboratories, block-to-block heterogeneity was
documented in 5% and 10% of the cases with FISH and
IHC results, respectively, for cases with > 1 evaluable tumor block.30
Discordance may also arise from the inherent differences in the characteristics of IHC and FISH HER2 testing assays. IHC and FISH assays provide complementary
results, each evaluating a different aspect of the biological
events underlying HER2-positive cancer.31 Each assay has
methodological and interpretive advantages and disadvantages that should be considered when analyzing HER2
test results. Erroneous results can stem from inadequate or
overfixation, antigen retrieval, antibody sensitivity, or
interpretation error.20 Preanalytic factors, including the
time from tissue removal to tissue fixation, type and duration of fixation, or tissue processing, have the potential to
negatively impact the consistency and reliability of HER2
testing.20,21 Rigorous quality control and standardization
of the testing process are essential for achieving accurate
and reproducible assay results. In the round-robin analysis
described previously, the overall concordance between
IHC and FISH results was 92% (343 of 373 blocks with
both an adjudicated IHC and FISH result).30 In our
Cancer

study, of the 22 tumors yielding HER2-positive results by
central retesting, there was discordance in results obtained
on central IHC and FISH in 11 of the samples. At present, the clinical significance of discordance between IHC
and FISH in terms of potential benefit from HER2targeted therapy is unclear. The goal of pathologists has
been to achieve a greater than 95% concordance between
IHC-negative/FISH-negative and between IHC 31/
FISH-positive results. Yet, considering the curative potential of trastuzumab treatment in the adjuvant setting, a
false-negative rate of 5% should be deemed disproportionate. Laboratories should endeavor to lower this percentage of false-negative tests to as close to 0% as
possible.20 Although some errors would inevitably remain
due to human error, many inaccuracies could be eliminated by following manufacturer’s instructions, participating in laboratory proficiency testing, or retesting
equivocal cases with another test or on a second tumor
specimen, as recommended in the ASCO/CAP guidelines20,21 as well as retesting HER2-negative results with
another test if only one test is used, as suggested by results
from VIRGO.
Although central retesting of patients’ tumor samples is not feasible in all cases, in this study, approximately
two-thirds of the tumor samples locally determined to be
HER2-negative yielded positive results centrally by the
testing methodology not performed locally. A better
understanding of HER2 testing discrepancies is clinically
relevant, because patients who have tumors that are incorrectly diagnosed as HER2-negative are denied the potential benefit derived from treatment with HER2-directed
therapies. Indeed, the Herceptin (trastuzumab) package
insert highlights the importance of accurate HER2 testing
by stating that relying on a single testing method to rule
out potential trastuzumab benefit is inadvisable.32
The 2007 ASCO/CAP recommendations for HER2
testing algorithms endorsed either IHC testing with reflex
testing by FISH for IHC 21 cases, or FISH testing
alone.20 These algorithms were recently revised to recommend consideration of repeat testing if results seem discordant with other histopathologic findings and
encouraged close communication between pathologists
and oncologists.21 Although the new guidelines did not
go as far as recommending reflex testing with the alternative assay for all HER2-negative cases,21 a recent modeling
analysis projected that retesting samples that were IHC 0,
IHC 11, and FISH-negative on their first test from
women with early-stage breast cancer was a cost-effective
strategy.33 The VIRGO tissue substudy data presented
here further support the idea of retesting all HER2Cancer

negative cases. HER2 status may be assessed by testing either the gene or protein in each tissue sample using FISH
and IHC testing, respectively; however, in the case of an
initial negative test by either testing methodology, one
should consider testing by the other methodology, especially in the presence of high-risk clinical or pathologic
features. This would ensure that HER2-positive cases are
not missed by just performing one test and would in part
address the inherent limitations of currently available
HER2 testing methodologies.
This substudy has certain limitations. Because of the
small number of patients with centrally determined
HER2-positive tumors (n 5 22), data regarding clinical
characteristics and outcomes of these patients are limited
and should be interpreted with caution. It is also unclear
whether these patients ever had the opportunity to be
treated with HER2-targeted therapy and, if so, how they
might have responded to such treatment. In addition, this
study was performed in a population of patients with
MBC, which may have resulted in a higher false-negative
rate compared with patients who had early-stage breast
cancer, because this high-risk population (either relapsed
following an earlier diagnosis or diagnosed with de novo
stage IV disease) tends to have a higher HER2-positivity
rate, in general. It is also not known how the assays were
performed in the local laboratories or whether the tumor
block initially tested was the same as that submitted for
the VIRGO tissue-based substudy. Finally, inherent limitations with tissue testing, such as tumor heterogeneity,
variations in HER2 assays, and preanalytical issues,
including fixation, could have affected assay performance.
Conclusions

The data from the VIRGO study highlight a cohort of
patients who were denied potentially efficacious therapy
due to possibly inaccurate HER2 testing, which may
impact a considerable number of patients with breast cancer. Given the magnitude of potential benefit provided by
HER2-directed therapy, it is essential to accurately and
reliably test for HER2 status so that patients may have the
opportunity to receive the most efficacious treatment for
their disease.
