High-coverage whole-genome sequence studies have so far focused on a limited number1 of
geographically restricted populations 2–5, or targeted at specific diseases, e.g. cancer6.
Nevertheless, the availability of high-resolution genomic data has led to the development of
new methodologies for inferring population history7–9 and refuelled the debate on the
mutation rate in humans10.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Here we present the Estonian Biocentre human Genome Diversity Panel (EGDP), a dataset
of 483 high-coverage human genomes from 148 populations worldwide, including 379 new
genomes from 125 populations, which we group into Diversity and Selection Sets (ED1-2;
SI1:1.1-7). We analyse this dataset to refine estimates of continent-wide patterns of
heterozygosity, long- and short-distance gene flow, archaic admixture, and changes in
effective population size through time. We find a genetic signature in present-day Papuans
suggesting that at least 2% of their genome originates from an early and largely extinct
expansion of anatomically modern humans (AMH) Out-of-Africa (xOoA). Together with
evidence from the Western Asian fossil record11, and admixture between AMHs and
Neanderthals predating the main Eurasian expansion12, our results contribute to the
mounting evidence for the presence of AMH out of Africa earlier than 75kya. We also
screen for signals of positive or balancing selection.
The paths taken by AMHs out of Africa (OoA) have been the subject of considerable debate
over the past two decades. Fossil and archaeological evidence13,14, and craniometric
studies15 of African and Asian populations, demonstrate that Homo sapiens was present

outside of Africa ca. 120-70 kya11. However, this colonization has been viewed as a failed
expansion OoA16 since genetic analyses of living populations have been consistent with a
single OoA followed by serial founder events17.

Ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing studies have found support for admixture between early
Eurasians and at least two archaic human lineages18,19, and suggests modern human
reached Eurasia at around 100kya12. In addition, aDNA from modern humans suggests
population structuring and turnover, but little additional archaic admixture, in Eurasia over
the last 35-45 thousand years20–22. Overall, these findings indicate that the majority of
human genetic diversity outside Africa derives from a single dispersal event that was
followed by admixture with archaic humans18,23.
We used ADMIXTURE to analyse the genetic structure in our Diversity Set (ED1). We
further compared the individual-level haplotype similarity of our samples using
fineSTRUCTURE (ED3). Despite small sample sizes, we inferred 106 genetically distinct
populations forming 12 major regional clusters, corresponding well to the 148 self-identified
population labels. This clustering forms the basis for the groupings used in the scans of
natural selection. Similar genetic affinities are highlighted by plotting the outgroup f3
statistic9 in the form f3(X, Y; Yoruba), which here measures shared drift between a nonAfrican population X and any modern or ancient population Y from Yoruba as an African
outgroup (SI1:2.2.6, ED4).

Our sampling allowed us to consider geographic features correlated with gene flow by
spatially interpolating genetic similarity measures between pairs of populations (SI1:2.2.2).
We considered several measures and report gradients of allele frequencies in Figure 1, which
was compared to gene flow patterns from EEMS24 as a validation (ED5). Controlling for
pairwise geographic distance, we find a correlation between these genetic gradients and
geographic and climatic features such as precipitation and elevation (inset of Figure 1,
SI1:2.2.2).
We screened for evidence of selection by first focusing on loci that showed the highest
allelic differentiation among groups (SI1:3). We then performed positive and purifying
selection scans (Methods), and find some candidate loci that replicate previously known and
functionally-supported findings (SI2:3.3.4-I, SI1:3.1, ED6; SI2:3.1-IV,VI). Additionally, we
infer more purifying selection in Africans in genes involved in pigmentation (bootstrapping
p value - bpv for RX/Y-scores <0.05) (ED6) and immune response against viruses
(bpv<0.05), whilst further purifying selection was indicated on olfactory receptor genes in
Asians (bpv p<0.05) (SI2:3.1.1-II). Our scans for ancient balancing selection found a
significant enrichment (FDR <0.01) of antigen processing/presentation, antigen binding, and
MHC and membrane component genes (SI1:3.2, SI2:3.3.2-I-III). The HLA (HLA-C)associated gene (BTNL2) was the top highest scoring candidate in eight of 12 geographic
regions for the HKA test (SI2:3.3.1-I). Our positive selection scans, variant-based analyses
(SI1:3.2 and 3.2) and gene enrichment studies also suggest new candidate loci (SI1:3.4;
SI2:3.5-I-VI), a subset of which is highlighted in Table SI2:3-I.

Using fineSTRUCTURE, we find in the genomes of Papuans and Philippine Negritos more
short haplotypes assigned as African than seen in genomes for individuals from other nonAfrican populations (ED7). This pattern remains after correcting for potential confounders
such as phasing errors and sampling bias (SI1:2.2.1). These shorter shared haplotypes would
be consistent with an older population split25. Indeed, the Papuan-Yoruban median genetic
split time (using MSMC) of 90 kya predates the split of all mainland Eurasian populations
from Yorubans at ~75 kya (SI2:2.2.3-I, ED4, Figure 2A). This result is robust to phasing
artefacts (ED8, See Methods). Furthermore, the Papuan-Eurasian MSMC split time of ~40
kya is older than splits between West Eurasian and East Asian populations at ~30 kya (ED4).
The Papuan split times from Yoruba and Eurasia are therefore incompatible with a simple
bifurcating population tree model.
At least two main models could explain our estimates of older divergence dates for Sahul
populations from Africa than mainland Eurasians in our sample: 1) Admixture in Sahul with
a potentially un-sampled archaic human population that split from modern humans either
before or at the same time as did Denisova and Neanderthal; or 2) Admixture in Sahul with a
modern human population (xOoA) that left Africa after the split between modern humans
and Neanderthals, but before the main expansion of modern humans in Eurasia (main OoA).
We consider support for these two non-mutually exclusive scenarios. Because the
introgressing lineage has not been observed with aDNA, standard methods are limited in
their ability to distinguish between these hypotheses. Furthermore we show (SI1:2.2.7) that
single-site statistics, such as Patterson’s D 9,18 and sharing of non-African Alleles (nAAs),
are inherently affected by confounding effects due to archaic introgression in non-African
populations23. Our approach therefore relies on multiple lines of evidence using haplotypebased MSMC and fineSTRUCTURE comparisons (which we show should have power at
this time scale26; SI2.2.13).

We located and masked putatively introgressed27 Denisova haplotypes from the genomes of
Papuans, and evaluated phasing errors by symmetrically phasing Papuans and Eurasians
genomes (Methods). Neither modification (Figure 3A, SI1:2.2.9, SI2:2.2.9-I) changed the
estimated split time (based on MSMC) between Africans and Papuans (Methods, SI1:2.2.8,
ED8, Table 2.2.8-I). MSMC dates behave approximately linearly under admixture (ED8),
implying that the hypothesised lineage may have split from most Africans around 120 kya
(SI1:2.2.4 and 2.2.8).
We compared the effect on the MSMC split times of a xOoA or a Denisova lineage in
Papuans by extensive coalescent simulations (SI1:2.2.8). We could not simulate the large
Papuan-African and Papuan-Eurasian split times inferred from the data, unless assuming an
implausibly large contribution from a Denisova-like population. Furthermore, while the
observed shift in the African-Papuan MSMC split curve can be qualitatively reproduced
when including a 4% genomic component that diverged 120 kya from the main human
lineage within Papuans, a similar quantity of Denisova admixture does not produce any
significant effect (ED8). This favours a small presence of xOoA lineages rather than
Denisova admixture alone as the likely cause of the observed deep African-Papuan split. We

also show (Methods) that such a scenario is compatible with the observed mtDNA and Y
chromosome lineages in Oceania, as also previously argued13,28.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We further tested our hypothesised xOoA model by analyzing haplotypes in the genomes of
Papuans that show African ancestry not found in other Eurasian populations. We re-ran
fineSTRUCTURE adding the Denisova, Altai Neanderthal and the Human Ancestral
Genome sequences29 to a subset of the Diversity Set. FineSTRUCTURE infers haplotypes
that have a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with another individual. Papuan
haplotypes assigned as African had, regardless, an elevated level of non-African derived
alleles (i.e. nAAs fixed ancestral in Africans) compared to such haplotypes in Eurasians.
They therefore have an older mean coalescence time with our African samples.
Due to the deep divergence between the sampled Denisova and the one introgressed into
modern humans, it is possible that some archaic haplotypes have a MRCA with an African
instead of Denisova and are assigned as “African”. We can resolve the coalescence time, and
hence origin, of these haplotypes by their sequence similarity with modern Africans. To
account for the archaic introgression we modelled these genomic segments as a mixture of
haplotypes assigned a) as African or b) as Denisova in Eurasians and c) haplotypes assigned
as Denisova in Papuans. These haplotypes are modelled (see Methods, ED9) in terms of the
distribution of length and mutation rate measured as a density of non-African derived alleles.
Since Eurasians (specifically Europeans) have not experienced Denisova admixture, this
approach disentangles lineages that coalesce before the human/Denisova split from those
that coalesce after.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We found that the xOoA signature (Figure 2B-D; SI1:2.2.10) was necessary to account for
the number of short haplotypes with “moderate” nAAs density in the data (i.e. proportion of
non-African derived sites higher than that of Eurasian haplotypes assigned as African but
significantly lower than that of those assigned Denisova in either Eurasians or Papuans).
Consistent with our MSMC findings (SI1:2.2.4), xOoA haplotypes have an estimated
MRCA 1.5 times older than the Eurasian haplotypes in Papuan genomes, while the
Denisovan haplotypes in Papuans are 4 times older than the Eurasian haplotypes. Adding up
the contributions across the genome (Methods) leads to a genome-wide estimate of 1.9%
xOoA (95% CI 1.5-3.3) in Papuans, which we view as a lower bound.
Our results consistently point towards a contribution from a modern human source for
derived29 alleles that are found in the genome sequence of Papuans but not in Africans.
Possible confounders could involve a shorter generation time in Papuan and Philippine
Negrito populations30, different recombination processes, or alternative demographic
histories that have not been investigated here. We therefore strongly encourage the
development of new model-based approaches that can investigate further the haplotype
patterns described here.
In conclusion, our results suggest that while the genomes of modern Papuans derive
primarily from the main expansion of modern humans out of Africa, we estimate that at least
2% of their genome sequence reflects an earlier, otherwise extinct, dispersal (ED10).

The inferred date of the xOoA split time (~120 kya) is consistent with fossil and
archaeological evidence for an early expansion of Homo sapiens from Africa13,14.
Furthermore, the recently identified modern human admixture into the Altai Neanderthal
before 100 kya12 is consistent with a modern human presence outside Africa well before the
main OoA split time ( ~75 kya). Further studies will confirm whether the Papuan genetic
signature reported here and the one observed in Altai Neanderthals reflect the same xOoA
human group, as well as clarify the timing and route followed during such an early
expansion. The high similarity between Papuans and the Altai Neanderthal reported in ED1
may indeed reflect a shared xOoA component. Further studies are needed to explore this
model and suggest that understanding human evolutionary history will require the recovery
of aDNA from additional fossils, and further archaeological investigations in under-explored
geographical regions.

Methods
Data Preparation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We analyse a set of genomes sequenced by the same technology (Complete Genomics Inc.)
which results in minimal platform differences between batches of samples analysed by slight
modifications of CG proprietary pipeline (ED2; SI 1.6). We see good concordance between
CG sequence and Illumina genotyping array results for the same samples with minor
reference bias in the latter data (ED2; SI 1.6). In the final dataset, we retained only one
second (Australians, to make use of all the available samples)- and five third-degree relatives
pairs (SI2:1.7-I). All genomes were annotated against the Ensembl GRCh37 database and
compared to dbSNP Human Build 141 and Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project dataset29
(SI1:1.1-6). We found 10,212,117 new SNPs, 401,911 of which were exonic. As expected
from our sampling scheme, existing lists of variable sites have been extended mostly by the
Siberian, South-East Asian and South Asian genomes, which contribute 89,836 (22.4%),
63,964 (15.9%) and 40,758 (10.1%) of the new exonic variants detected in this study.
Compared to the genome-wide average, we see fewer heterozygous sites on chromosomes 1
and 2, and an excess on chromosomes 16, 19 and 21 (ED2). This pattern is independent of
simple potential confounders, such as rough estimates of recombination activity and gene
density (SI1:1.8), and mirrors the inter-chromosomal differences in divergence from
chimpanzee31, suggesting large-scale differences in mutation rates among chromosomes.
We confirmed this general pattern using 1000 Genomes Project data (SI1:1.8).
The “ancient genome diversity panel” consisted of 106 samples from the main Diversity
panel along with Altai Neanderthal, Denisova and the Modern Human reference genome.
Sites that are heterozygous in archaic humans were removed.

Geographic gradient analyses

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We used a Gaussian kernel smoothing (based on the shortest distance on land to each
sample) to interpolate genetic patterns across space. Averaging over all markers, we obtained
an expression for the mean square gradient of allele frequencies in terms of the matrix of
genetic distance between pairs of samples (SI1:2.2.2). This provides a simple way to identify
spatial regions that contribute strongly to genetic differences between samples, and can be
used, in principle, for any measure of genetic difference (for fineSTRUCTURE data, we
used negative shared haplotype length as a measure of differentiation).
To quantify the link between the magnitude of genetic gradients (from fineSTRUCTURE
and allele frequency data) and geographic factors, we fitted a generalised linear model to the
sum of genetic magnitude gradients on the shortest paths between samples to elevation,
minimum quarterly temperature, and annual precipitation summed in the same way,
controlling for path length and spatial random effects (SI1:2.2.2), and calculated partial
correlations between genetic gradient magnitudes and geographic factors.
Finestructure Analysis
FineSTRUCTURE32 was run as described in SI1:S2.2.1. Within the 106 genetically distinct
genetic groups, labels were typically genetically homogeneous - 113 of the 148 population
labels (76%) were assigned to only one ‘genetic cluster’. Similarly, genetic clusters were
typically specific to a label, with 66 of the 106 ‘genetic clusters’ (62%) containing only one
population label.

Correction for phasing errors—To check whether phasing errors could produce the
shorter Papuan haplotypes, we focussed on regions of the genome that had an extended
(>500Kb) run of homozygosity. We ran ChromoPainter for each individual on only these
regions, meaning each individual was only painted where it had been perfectly phased. This
did not change the qualitative features (SI1:2.2.1).
Removal of similar samples—Papuans are genetically distinct from other populations
due to tens of thousands of years of isolation. We wanted to check whether the length of
haplotypes assigned as African were biased by the inclusion of a large number of relatively
homogeneous Eurasians with few Papuans. To do this we repeated the N=447 painting
allowing only donors from dissimilar populations, including only individuals who donated
<2% of a genome in the main painting. This did not change the qualitative haplotype length
features (SI1:2.2.1).
Inclusion of ancient samples—We ran our smaller individual panel with (N=109) and
without (N=106) ancient samples (Denisova, Neanderthal and ancestral human). This did
not change the qualitative haplotype length features (SI1:2.2.1).
Selection Analyses
We investigated balancing, positive and purifying selection for a part of the dataset with
larger group sizes which was defined as the Selection subset (SI2:3.1-I; SI2:3.2-I) using a
wide range of window-based as well as variant-based approaches. Furthermore we

investigated how these signals relate to shared demographic history. Where possible we
contextualized our findings by integrating them with information from various functional
databases. Detailed descriptions of all methods used are available in SI1:3.

MSMC, Denisova masking, simulations of alternative scenarios and assessment of
phasing robustness
Genetic split times were initially calculated following the standard MSMC procedure8, and
subsequently modified as follows. To estimate the effect of archaic admixture, putative
Denisova haplotypes were identified in Papuans using a previously published method27 and
masked from all the analysed genomes. Particularly, whether a putative archaic haplotype
was found in heterozygous or homozygous state within the chosen Papuan genome, the
“affected” locus was inserted into the MSMC mask files and, hence, removed from the
analysis.
We note that a fraction of the Denisova and Neanderthal contributions to the Papuan
genomes may be indistinguishable, due to the shared evolutionary history of these two
archaic populations. As a result, some of the removed “Denisova” haplotypes may have
actually entered the genome of Papuans through Neanderthal. Regardless of this, our
exercise successfully shows that the MSMC split time estimates are not affected by the
documented presence of archaic genomic component (whether coming entirely from
Denisova or partially shared with Neanderthal).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We further excluded the role of Denisova admixture in explaining the deeper AfricanPapuan MSMC split times through coalescent simulations (using ms to generate 30
chromosomes of 5 Mbp each, and simulating each scenario 30 times). These showed that the
addition of 4% Denisova lineages to the Papuan genomes does not change the MSMC
results, while the addition of 4% xOoA lineages recreates the qualitative shift observed in
the empirical data.
Phasing artefacts were also taken into account as putative confounders of the MSMC split
time estimates. We re-run MSMC after re-phasing one Estonian, one Papuan and 20 West
African and Pygmies genomes in a single experiment. By this way we ruled out potential
artefacts stemming from the excess of Eurasian over Sahul samples during the phasing
process. Both the archaic and phasing corrections yielded the same split time as of the
standard MSMC runs.
Emulation of all pairwise MSMC split times
We confirmed that none of the other populations behaved as an outlier from those identified
in the N=22 full pairwise analysis by estimating the MSMC split times between all pairs. We
chose 9 representative populations (including Papuan, Yoruba and Baka) from the 22, and
compared each of the 447 diversity panel genomes to them. We learn a model for each
individual l not in our panel,

where the positive mixture weights αk sum to 1 and are otherwise learned from the j ∈ (1..9)
observations which we have data under quadratic loss. We can then predict the unobserved
values

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Examination of this matrix (SI1:S2.2.3, SI2:2.2.3-III) implies no other populations are
expected to have unusual MSMC split times from Africa.
Mixture model for African haplotypes in Papuans
Obtaining haplotypes from painting—We define as haplotypes assigned as African or
Archaic in Eurasians or Papuans a genomic locus spanning at least 1000bp, and showing
SNPs that were assigned by chromopainter a 50% chance of copying from either an African
or Archaic genome, respectively. For each haplotype we then calculated the number of nonAfrican mutations, defined as sites found in derived state in a given haplotype and in
ancestral state in all of the African genomes included in the present study.
Modelling—We used a non-parametric model for the joint distribution of length and nonAfrican derived allele mutation rate in haplotypes. We fit K (=20) components to the joint
distribution. Each component has a characteristic length lk, variability σk and mutation rate
μk. A haplotype of length li with Xi such mutations from component li = k has the following
distribution:

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

This model for haplotype lengths is motivated by the extreme age of the split times we seek
to model. Recent splits would lead to an exponential distribution of haplotype lengths.
However, due to haplotype fixation caused by finite population size, very old splits have
finite (non-zero) haplotype lengths. Additionally, the data are left-censored since we cannot
reliably detect haplotypes that are very short. We note that whilst this makes a single
component a reasonable fit to the data, as K increases the specific choice becomes less
important.
We then impose the prior p(Ii = k) =1/K and use the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to
estimate the mixture proportions πik = E(Iik|li,Xi) along with the maximum likelihood
We do this for the four combinations of haplotypes

assigned as African (AFR) and Denisova (DEN) found in Papuans (PNG) or Europeans
(EUR), in order to learn the parameters. SI1:S2.2.10 describes this in more detail. We then

describe the distribution of haplotypes for each class c of haplotype in terms of the expected
proportion of haplotypes found in each component,

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

where Nc is the number of haplotypes of class c. πc is a vector of the proportions from each
of the K components.
Single-out-of-Africa model—We fit haplotypes assigned as African in Papuans as a
mixture of the others in a second layer of mixture modelling:

where αc sum to 1. This is straightforward to fit.
xOoA model—We jointly estimate an additional component πxOoA and the mixture
contributions βc under the mixture

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

This is non-trivial to fit. We use a penalisation scheme to simultaneously ensure we a) obtain
a valid mixture for βc, b) give a prediction xk that is also a valid mixture, c) leave little signal
in the residuals, and d) obtain a good fit. Cross-validation is used to obtain the optimal
penalisation parameters (A and B) with the loss function:

where ek are the residuals in each component,
(for a valid
mixture) and PB = s.d(ek) (for requirement c, good solutions will have similar residuals
across components). The loss is minimised via standard optimization techniques.
SI1:S2.2.10 details how initial values are found and explores the robustness of the solution
to changes in A and B - the results do not change qualitatively for reasonable choices of
these parameters, and the mixtures are valid to within numerical error.
Genome-wide xOoA estimation—We used the estimated xOoA derived allele mutation
rate estimate θxOoA to estimate the xOoA contribution in haplotypes classed as Eurasian or
Papuan by ChromoPainter. First we obtained estimates of πPNG.EUR and πPNG.PNG using the
single out-of-Africa model above, additionally allowing a EUR.EUR contribution. We then
estimate αxOoA using the observed mutation rate θobs and that predicted under the mixture
model θmix by rearranging the mixture:

Estimates less than zero are set to 0. The genome wide estimate is obtained by weighting
each θ by the proportion of the genome that was painted with that donor. Neanderthal and
Denisova haplotypes were assumed to be proxied by PNG.DEN (0% xOoA by assumption);
African haplotypes by PNG.AFR; Papuan and Australian by PNG.PNG and all other
haplotypes by PNG.EUR. We obtain confidence intervals by bootstrap resampling of
haplotypes for each donor/recipient pair.
We estimate the proportion of xOoA in Papuan haplotypes assigned as both Eurasian (0.1%,
95% CI 0-2.6) and Papuan (4%, 95% CI 2.9-4.5) (SI1:2.2.10), by using the estimated
mutation density in xOoA.
Y chromosome and mtDNA haplopgroup analysis
The presence of an extinct xOoA trace in the genome of modern Papuans may seem at odds
with analyses of mtDNA and Y chromosome phylogenies, which point to a single, recent
origin for all non-African lineages (mtDNA L3, which gives rise to all mtDNA lineages
outside Africa has been dated at ~70 kya,33,34). However, uniparental markers inform on a
small fraction of our genetic history, and a single origin for all non-African lineages does not
exclude multiple waves OoA from a shared common ancestor. We show analytically
(SI1:2.2.12) that, if the xOoA signature entered the genome of Papuan individuals >40 kya,
their mtDNA and Y lineages could have been lost by genetic drift even assuming an initial
xOoA mixing component of up to 35%. Similar findings have been reported recently13.

ED3. FineSTRUCTURE shared ancestry analysis.

ChromoPainter and FineSTRUCTURE results, showing both inferred populations with the
underlying (averaged) number of haplotypes that an individual in a population receives
(rows) from donor individuals in other populations (columns). 108 populations are inferred
by FineSTRUCTURE. The dendrogram shows the inferred relationship between
populations. The numbers on the dendrogram give the proportion of MCMC iterations for
which each population split is observed (where this is less than 1). Each “geographical
region” has a unique colour from which individuals are labeled. The number of individuals

increasing distance from Africa (left to right for columns and bottom to top for rows).
Colour bars at the left and top of the heat map indicate the colour coding used for the
geographical region. Individual population labels are indicated at the right and bottom of the
heat map. The f3 statistics are scaled to lie between 0 and 1, with a black colour indicating
those close to 0 and a red colour indicating those close to 1. Let m and M be the minimum
and maximum f3 values within a given row (i.e., focal population). That is, for focal
population X (on rows), m = minY,Y≠X f3(X, Y ; Yoruba) and M = maxY,Y≠X f3(X, Y ;
Yoruba). The scaled f3 statistic for a given cell in that row is given by f3scaled=(f3-m)/(Mm), so that the smallest f3 in the row has value f3scaled=0 (black) and the largest has value
f3scaled=1 (red). By default, the diagonal has value f3scaled=1 (red). The heat map is
therefore asymmetric, with the population closest to the focal population at a given row
having value f3scaled=1 (red colour) and the population farthest from the focal population at
a given row having value f3scaled=0 (black colour). Therefore, at a given row, scanning the
columns of the heat map reveals the populations with the most shared ancestry with the focal
population of that row in the heat map.

Result (B) of 1000 bootstrap replica of the Rxy test for a subset of pigmentation genes
highlighted by GWAS (n=32). The horizontal line provides the African reference (x=1)
against which all other groups are compared. The blue and red marks show the 95th and the
5th percentile of the bootstrap distributions respectively. If the 95th percentile is below 1,
then the population shows a significant excess of missense variants in the pigmentation
subset relative to the Africans. Note that this is the case for all non-Africans except the
Oceanians. Pools (C) of individuals for selection scans. fineSTRUCTURE based coancestry

for which an individual was in a long (>500kb) Run of Homozygosity using the PLINK
command “--homozyg-window-kb 500000 --homozyg-window-het 0 --homozyg-density
10”. Because there are so few such regions, we report only the population average for
populations with two or more individuals, as well as the standard error in that estimate.
Populations for whom the 95% CI passed 0 were also excluded. Note the logarithmic axis.
D: Ancient DNA panel results. We used a different panel of 109 individuals which included
3 ancient genomes. We painted Chromosomes 11, 21 & 22 and report as crosses the
population averages for populations with 2 or more individuals. The solid thin lines
represent the position of each population when modern samples only are analysed. The

ED8. MSMC Linear behavior of MSMC split estimates in presence of admixture.

The examined Central Asian (A), East African (B), and African-American (C) genomes
yielded a signature of MSMC split time (Truth, left-most column) that could be recapitulated
(Reconstruction, second left most column) as a linear mixture of other MSMC split times.
The admixture proportions inferred by our method (top of each admixture component
column) were remarkably similar to the ones previously reported from the literature.
MSMC split times (D) calculated after re-phasing an Estonian and a Papuan (Koinanbe)
genome together with all the available West African and Pygmy genomes from our dataset

to minimize putative phasing artefacts. The cross coalescence rate curves reported here are
quantitatively comparable with the ones of Figure 2 A, hence showing that phasing artefacts
are unlikely to explain the observed past-ward shift of the Papuan-African split time.

0.0018) but more importantly, they are also structured. C: Assuming a mutational clock and
a correct assignment of haplotypes, we can estimate the relative age of the splits from the
number of derived alleles observed on the haplotypes. This leads to an estimate of 1.5 times
older for xOoA compared to the Eurasian-Africa split.

Figure 1. Genetic barriers across space.

Spatial visualisation of genetic barriers inferred from genome-wide genetic distances,
quantified as the magnitude of the gradient of spatially interpolated allele frequencies (value
denoted by colour bar; grey areas have been land during the last glacial maximum but are
currently under water). Here we used a spatial kernel smoothing method based on the matrix
of pairwise average heterozygosity a matlab script that plots the hexagons of the grid with a
colour coding to represent gradients Inset: partial correlation between magnitude of genetic
gradients and combinations of different geographic factors, elevation (E), temperature (T)
and precipitation (P), for genetic gradients from fineSTRUCTURE (red) and allele
frequencies (blue). This analysis (SI1:2.2.2 for details) shows that genetic differences within
this region display some correlation with physical barriers such as mountain ranges, deserts,
forests, and open water (such as the Wallace line).

Panel A: MSMC split times plot. The Yoruba-Eurasia split curve shows the mean of all
Eurasian genomes against one Yoruba genome. The grey area represents top and bottom 5%
of runs. We chose a Koinanbe genome as representative of the Sahul populations. Panels BD: Decomposition of Papuan haplotypes inferred as African by fineSTRUCTURE. Panel B:
Semi-parametric decomposition of the joint distribution of haplotype lengths and nonAfrican derived allele rate per SNP, showing the relative proportion of haplotypes in K=20
components of the distribution, ordered by non-African derived allele rate, relative to the
overall proportion of haplotypes in each component. The four datasets produced by
considering haplotypes inferred as (African/Denisova) in (Europeans/Papuans) are shown
with our inferred "extra Out-of-Africa xOoA" component. Panel C: The properties of the
components in terms of non-African derived allele rate, on which the components are
ordered, and length.
Panel D: The reconstruction of haplotypes inferred as African in the genomes of Papuan
individuals, using a mixture of all other data (red) and with the addition of the xOoA
signature (black).
