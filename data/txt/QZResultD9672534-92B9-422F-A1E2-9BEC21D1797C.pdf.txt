Abstract
Understanding the mechanism of cisplatin (CDDP) action may
improve therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer. Although p53
and FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) are determinants of
CDDP sensitivity in ovarian cancer, the interaction between
p53 and FLIP remains poorly understood. Here, using two
chemosensitive ovarian cancer cell lines and various molecular and cellular approaches, we show that CDDP induces
p53-dependent FLIP ubiquitination and degradation, and
apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, we showed that Itch (an E3
ligase) forms a complex with FLIP and p53 upon CDDP
treatment. These results suggest that p53 facilitates FLIP
down-regulation by CDDP-induced FLIP ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4511–7]

Introduction
Cisplatin (CDDP) is the first-line anticancer agent for human
ovarian cancer and is known to act in part by induction of
apoptosis (1). In CDDP-sensitive cells, it also decreases cellular
levels of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP), a FADD-binding
suppressor of apoptosis, which is present as two splice variants:
FLIPL (55 kDa) and FLIPS (28 kDa). FLIP contains two NH2terminal death effector domains (DED), which prevent caspase-8
activation through DED-DED interaction (2). Although FLIP downregulation is an important factor in CDDP-mediated apoptosis,
its mechanism remained unclear (3).
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) could be involved in
regulating FLIP. UPP is a major regulatory mechanism for
intracellular protein level. This process is mediated by an E1 (Ub
activating enzyme), E2 (Ub conjugase), and E3 (Ub ligase) complex.
Typically, proteins modified by polyubiquitin chains are recognized
and degraded by the proteasome (4). Importantly, Itch, a member
of the HECT family of E3 ligases, interacts with FLIP and is believed
to mediate its degradation as well as tumor necrosis factor
a–induced apoptosis (5).
p53 is a transcription factor that regulates cell cycle progression,
DNA repair, and apoptosis. p53 is maintained at low levels by its
negative regulator, MDM2, which ubiquitinates p53, targeting it for
proteasomal degradation (6). TP53 mutations are frequently
observed in human ovarian cancer cells (7) and associated with
decreased chemoresponsiveness (8).

In the present study, we investigated the involvement of Itch and
p53 in CDDP-induced FLIP down-regulation. We showed that CDDP
enhances FLIP-p53-Itch interaction, inducing FLIP ubiquitination
and degradation in a p53- and Itch-dependent manner. These
results suggest that the modulation of FLIP content may be an
effective strategy to overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. MG132, Lactacystin, and Epoxomicin were from Calbiochem
(Ab-1). Cell Signaling, Inc., Ambion, and Dharmacon, Inc. provided siRNA
for p53, Itch, and control, respectively. Ribojuice and Lipofectamine Plus
were from Novagen and Invitrogen, respectively. HA-tagged ubiquitin was
provided by Dr. Qiao Li (University of Ottawa, Canada). Adenoviral cDNAs
were synthesized at the University of Ottawa Neuroscience Research
Institute. Primary antibodies for immunoblots were mouse monoclonal
anti-p53 (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), anti-FLIP (NF6; Alexis; Ab-1)
and anti-Itch (BD Bioscience), anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; ab8245; Abcam), and anti-V5 (Invitrogen). Antibodies for
precipitation were goat polyclonal anti-HA and anti-V5 (Bethyl Laboratories) and anti-p53 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and for immunofluorescence were rabbit polyclonal anti-FLIP (Cell Signaling Technology)
and anti-p53 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and mouse monoclonal
anti-Itch (BD Bioscience). Donkey secondary antibodies were from Jackson
Immunoresearch.
Cell culture and adenovirus infection. Chemosensitive ovarian cancer
cells (OV2008 and A2780s) were cultured as previously reported (8). Cells
were infected with appropriate adenoviral constructs as indicated in the
text. LacZ adenovirus was used to normalize each treatment group to same
total adenoviral concentration. Adenovirus infection efficiency [multiplicity
of infection (MOI), 5; 24 h] was >90% (8).
FLIP ubiquitination analysis. Cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin
(3). After 24 h, spent medium was replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 or DMEM
F12 containing CDDP (0–10 AM; 0–9 h) and Epoxomicin. Cells were
harvested for FLIP ubiquitination analyses (9). The cell pellet was
resuspended in boiling 1% SDS in PBS, heated (100jC for 5 min), and
suspended in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS (1:10). DNA was sheared by
sonication, and after centrifugation (14,000  g for 15 min), the supernatant
[diluted with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS (1:1)]
was incubated (overnight for 4jC) with primary antibody. The beads were
washed (6 times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS), and the precipitated proteins
were immunoblotted.
RNA interference. Cells transfected for 24 h with p53 siRNA (100 nmol/
L), Itch siRNA (100 nmol/L), or control siRNA (100 nmol/L; ref. 3) were
treated with CDDP and harvested for subsequent analysis.
Western blotting. Western blotting (WB) was done as previously
described (3). Membranes were incubated with anti-FLIP (NF60; 1:500),
anti-GAPDH (1:20,000), anti-p53 (1:1,000), anti-Itch (1:500), or anti-V5
(1:5,000; overnight for 4jC], and with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1,000–10,000; 1 h at room
temperature). Peroxidase activity was visualized with the enhanced
chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed (Scion Image
software; Scion, Inc.).

Figure 1. CDDP down-regulates FLIP through Itch-dependent proteasomal degradation. A, CDDP decreased FLIPL and FLIPS contents and induced apoptosis
in a concentration-dependent manner in OV2008 and A2780s cells [***, P < 0.001 versus control (CTL ); n = 3]. OV2008 and A2780s cells were cultured with
CDDP (0–10 Amol/L; 24 h) and assessed for FLIP and GAPDH contents by WB (top ), and for apoptosis by Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining (bottom ). GAPDH served
as a protein loading control. B, CDDP, at concentration that decreased FLIP protein contents (10 Amol/L), failed to elicit a significant influence on FLIP mRNA
abundance (P > 0.05, n = 3; top ). OV2008 and A2780s cells were cultured for different duration (0–24 h) with CDDP (0–10 Amol/L). FLIP mRNA abundance was
determined by RT-PCR (n = 3); WB analysis indicating that the CDDP-induced FLIPL, and FLIPS down-regulation was attenuated by the presence of proteasome
inhibitors (***, P < 0.001; n = 3; bottom ). OV2008 cells were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 (5 Amol/L), Lactacystin (10 Amol/L), and Epoxomicin
(25 nmol/L) and then treated for 12 h with CDDP or DMSO (control). C to D, CDDP-induced FLIP ubiquitination is dependent on Itch (n = 3). OV2008 and A2780s
transfected with HA-ubiquitin (2 Ag; 24 h); infected (MOI, 25; 24 h) with adenoviral V5-FLIPL (V5-FL; C ), V5-FLIPS (V5-FS; D ), or LacZ (as control) in the absence
or presence of Itch siRNA (100 nmol/L; 24 h); and then treated with CDDP (0–10 Amol/L) and Epoxomicin (25 nmol/L, to prevent proteasomal degradation of
ubiquitinated FLIP). Cells only infected with LacZ (lane 2) or transfected with HA-ub (lane 3) are indicated. At the end of 1.5 and 3 h, cells were harvested for
assessment of Itch and GAPDH contents (C and D, top ; WB) as well as V5-FLIPL and V5-FLIPS ubiquitination [C and D, bottom , respectively; IP (anti–HA-ubiquitin,
IgG as control) and WB (V5-FL or V5-FS)].

FLIP mRNA analysis. Relative differences in FLIP mRNA levels in
experimental groups were determined semiquantitatively by reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Total RNA was reverse transcribed followed
by PCR (10).
Assessment of apoptosis. Apoptosis was determined morphologically,
using Hoechst 33258 nuclear stain (3). The counter was ‘‘blinded’’ to avoid
experimental bias.
Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation IP was performed on
whole cell lysates using anti-V5 and -p53 antibodies (11) and immunoblotted
for p53, Itch, and V5.

Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Cultured OV2008
cells were fixed with methanol (10 min at 20jC). Nonspecific binding was
blocked with 0.8% (w/v) serum albumin and 1% gelatin in PBS (30 min at
room temperature; ref. 12). Cells were then incubated with anti-p53 (1:50),
anti-FLIP (1:25), and anti-Itch (1:25; overnight at 4jC) and subsequently
with secondary donkey-conjugated antibodies: anti-goat (Cy5), anti-mouse
(Cy3), and anti-rabbit (FITC; 1:25; 2 h at room temperature). Cells were
mounted with Vectashield (Vector). Cells incubated without primary
antibodies served as negative controls. Fluorescence images (1,024 
1,024 pixels) were acquired using a LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning

Results and Discussion
CDDP down-regulates FLIP protein content via FLIP
proteasomal degradation. Our recent study shows that CDDP
down-regulates FLIP content and induces apoptosis in ovarian
cancer cells (3). To better understand how CDDP decreases FLIP
level in ovarian cancer cells, two ovarian cancer cell lines (OV2008
and A2780s) were cultured with CDDP (0–10 Amol/L; 24 hours) and

described in Fig. 2 (n = 3).

FLIP content was determined. CDDP decreases FLIPL and FLIPS
levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). FLIP
down-regulation was associated with increased apoptosis
(Fig. 1A). The down-regulation of FLIP by CDDP (0–10 Amol/L;

control cells (A ). Clusters were restricted to the cytoplasm and rarely colocalized (arrowhead). In contrast, CDDP treatment (C ) resulted in Itch-, FLIP-, and p53

Although diffuse pattern is represented by constant fluorescence intensity along the membrane of control cells (B1–4 ), clustered pattern is indicated by hotspots
of fluorescence in CDDP-treated cells (D1–4 ), which also exhibited similar Itch, FLIP, and p53 fluorescence profiles. OV2008 cells were treated with DMSO (control,

were pretreated for 30 minutes with proteasome inhibitors MG132
(5 Amol/L), Lactacystin (10 Amol/L), or Epoxomicin (25 nmol/L)
and cultured with CDDP for an additional 12 hours. Although the
proteasome inhibitors displayed no effect on basal FLIP content,
they significantly attenuated the decrease in FLIPL and FLIPS level
induced by CDDP (Fig. 1B, bottom), suggesting that proteasomal
degradation may be responsible for the decreased FLIP content
after CDDP challenge. Similarly, CDDP induces the proteasomal
degradation of the antiapoptotic protein Xiap without affecting its
mRNA abundance (15).
CDDP enhances FLIP-Itch interaction and FLIP ubiquitination. Because proteasomal degradation of most proteins is
preceded by ubiquitination, we examined whether CDDP induces
FLIPL and FLIPS ubiquitination. OV2008 and A2780s cells were
transfected with HA-ubiquitin (2 Ag; 24 hours); infected (MOI=25;
24 hours) with adenoviral V5-FLIPL, V5-FLIPS, or LacZ (as control);
and treated with CDDP (0–10 Amol/L) in the presence of
Epoxomicin (25 nmol/L) for 1.5 and 3 hours, respectively.
Ubiquitinated FLIP was immunoprecipitated with anti–HA-ubiquitin and immunoblotted with anti–V5-FL or anti–V5-FS. Although
FLIP ubiquitination was not detectable with nonspecific IgG or in
cells infected with LacZ or HA-ub alone, CDDP enhanced FLIPL
and FLIPS ubiquitination (Fig. 1C–D, bottom), demonstrating that
CDDP-induced FLIP degradation in ovarian cancer cells is
associated with FLIP ubiquitination.
Because Itch possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and is
involved in protein ubiquitination (5), we determined whether
Itch plays a role in CDDP-induced FLIP ubiquitination by
targeting Itch with siRNA (Fig. 1C–D, top). Although CDDP
increased FLIPL and FLIPS ubiquitination in cells transfected
with control siRNA, these responses were markedly suppressed
by Itch depletion (Fig. 1C–D, bottom), indicating a requirement
for Itch in CDDP-induced FLIP ubiquitination. Although Itch has
been shown to facilitate FLIPL degradation in hepatocytes (5),
FLIPS ubiquitination was not examined nor was the effect of
CDDP. The present study is the first to show that Itch plays a
vital role in the ubiquitination of both FLIPL and FLIPS after
CDDP treatment.
To determine whether Itch directly interacts with FLIP and if
such an interaction leads to CDDP-dependent FLIP decrease,
coprecipitation studies were carried out with OV2008 and A2780s
cells transfected with HA-ubiquitin (2 Ag; 24 hours) and
subsequently infected (MOI=25; 24 hours) with adenoviral
V5-FLIPL, V5-FLIPS, or LacZ and treated with CDDP (0–10 Amol/
L) in the presence of Epoxomicin (25 nmol/L). As shown in Fig. 2A
and C, FLIP-Itch interaction was not detected with nonspecific
IgG or in cells infected with LacZ and was slightly detectable in
absence of CDDP. This response was enhanced by CDDP after 1.5
hours for FLIPS (Fig. 2C, top) and 3 hours for FLIPL (Fig. 2A, top),
and associated with an enhancement in CDDP-induced FLIPL and
FLIPS ubiquitination (Fig. 2B and D). These results suggest that
FLIP-Itch binding may be crucial for FLIP regulation, and that
CDDP decreases FLIP content by enhancing FLIP-Itch interaction,
FLIP ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Our findings
are consistent with previous findings that FLIPS possesses a shorter
half-life than FLIPL due to the presence of a unique c-terminus tail
(Lys 193 and Lys195; ref. 9). Although FLIP ubiquitination has been
detected in several cell subtypes (16–18), the precise mechanism
underlying FLIP ubiquitination was not determined. In the present
study, we show for the first time that Itch binds to FLIPS and FLIPL
to facilitate FLIP ubiquitination in a time-dependent manner.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

p53 is required for CDDP-induced FLIP ubiquitination.
Although some studies suggest p53 could control FLIP protein
levels via the regulation of FLIP proteasomal degradation (19),
direct evidence for such a conclusion was lacking. We thus
investigated whether p53 is involved in the regulation of CDDPinduced FLIP degradation and apoptosis by transfecting ovarian
cancer cells with p53 siRNA (0–100 nmol/L; 24 hours) before CDDP
treatment (10 Amol/L; 24 hours). As expected, CDDP up-regulated
p53, decreased FLIPL and FLIPS protein content, and induced
apoptosis in cells transfected with control siRNA. In contrast, all
these responses were attenuated in cells depleted of p53 (Fig. 3A).
These results strongly suggest that p53 is an important regulator of
FLIP and is required for CDDP-induced FLIP down-regulation and
apoptosis. Our studies extend the observations from several studies
demonstrating a direct correlation between p53 content and FLIP
down-regulation (19, 20).
To examine if p53 interacts with FLIP in response to CDDP, we
investigated FLIP-p53 interaction by IP (p53 and V5) and WB
(V5 and p53, respectively). OV2008 and A2780s cells exhibited
lower basal p53 levels, which were up-regulated by CDDP in a
time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and C). Furthermore, although
FLIP-p53 interaction was barely detectable in the absence of
CDDP, this response was increased by CDDP at 1.5 hours for
FLIPS (Fig. 2C) and 3 hours for FLIPL (Fig. 2A). CDDP also
enhanced p53-Itch binding in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A
and C). These responses were associated with increased FLIPL and
FLIPS ubiquitination in response to CDDP (Fig. 2B and D). Our
results show that CDDP increases p53-FLIP-Itch interaction, which
may be important for FLIP ubiquitination and degradation.
We further elucidated whether CDDP-induced FLIP ubiquitination is p53 dependent by depleting p53. Our coprecipitation studies
show that CDDP enhances p53-FLIP interaction (Fig. 3B–C). These
responses were associated with increased CDDP-induced FLIPL
and FLIPS ubiquitination but attenuated after p53 down-regulation
by p53 siRNA (100 nmol/L; 24 hours; Fig. 3B–C). Interestingly, p53
has been shown to facilitate FLIPL degradation and ubiquitination
in colon cancer cells (19) and temperature-sensitive Germ cell-2
(20). These studies are consistent with our contention that, in
response to CDDP, p53 binds to FLIP and Itch to facilitate FLIP
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
Our results clearly show that p53 plays an important role in
CDDP-induced FLIP ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, a
phenomenon that involves Itch. To further test the above hypothesis,
we examined FLIP-p53-Itch colocalization by triple immunolabeling
on OV2008 cells treated with or without CDDP (0–2.5 Amol/L;
2 hours; Fig. 4). In control cells (DMSO; Fig. 4), FLIP-, Itch-, and p53immunoreactivities (-IR) mostly displayed diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane. Individual clusters of
FLIP, Itch, and p53 along with a few triple colocalizations were
observed in the cytoplasm. In contrast, cells treated with CDDP
exhibited numerous FLIP, Itch, and p53 clusters at the cell
membrane, with frequent triple colocalizations. Interestingly, CDDP
induces p53 nucleus localization at 6 hours but not earlier (data not
shown). Our findings are consistent with the contention that FLIP is
recruited by Itch at the cell membrane in a p53-dependent manner. A
similar recruitment phenomenon for FLIP by FADD at the Fas
receptor has been reported and is believed to suppress caspase8 activation (2). These results strongly argue in favor of a mechanism
involving FLIP-p53-Itch colocalization after CDDP treatment. Moreover, p53, as a docking protein, could facilitate FLIP-Itch interaction,
FLIP ubiquitination and degradation, and ultimately apoptosis.

Regulation of FLIP Ubiquitination by p53 and Itch

In summary, we report that (a) CDDP down-regulates FLIP
protein content via FLIP proteasomal degradation, (b) CDDP
enhances FLIP-p53-Itch interaction and FLIP ubiquitination, and
(c) p53 and Itch are required for CDDP-induced FLIP ubiquitination.
These results are of high relevance for the modulation of FLIP as a
possible modality in overcoming chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.
