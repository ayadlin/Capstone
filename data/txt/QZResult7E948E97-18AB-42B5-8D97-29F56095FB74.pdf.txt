ABSTRACT
Obatoclax is a small molecule which targets the Bcl-2 family, and is to treat
leukemia, lymphoma and lung carcinoma. Previously, an obatoclax analogue, SC2001, was found to disrupt the protein-protein interactions of the Bcl-2 family and
also repress Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression via STAT3 inactivation. Here, we report a
novel mechanism of autophagy induction by SC-2001 in liver cancer cells. The findings
indicate that SC-2001 induced the autophagy marker LC3-II in four hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) cells. Autophagosomes induced by SC-2001-treated cells were
confirmed by electron microscopy. SC-2001 activated SHP-1, dephosphorylated STAT3
and Mcl-1, and subsequently released free beclin 1. Overexpression of STAT3 and
Mcl-1 in PLC5 cells attenuated the induction of SC-2001 on autophagy. Abolishment
of SHP-1 by a specific inhibitor aboragated the autophagic effects induced by SC-2001.
In addition, it was further revealed that RFX-1, a transcription factor of SHP-1, is a
critical regulator in SC-2001-mediated autophagy. Downregulation of RFX-1 by si-RNA
protected cells from SC-2001-induced autophagy. Importantly, Huh7 tumor-bearing
nude mice treated with SC-2001 showed downregulation of Mcl-1 and p-STAT3
protein expression and upregulation of SHP-1, LC3II, and RFX-1 protein expression.
In summary, our data suggest that SC-2001 induces autophagic cell death in a RFX1/
SHP-1/STAT3/Mcl-1 signaling cascade.

INTRODUCTION

and expansion of vesicle. The second step is a docking
and fusion process in which the autophagolysosome is
formed by the interaction of autophagosome, endosomes,
as well as the lysosomes. Biomolecules embedded in
the autophagolysosome are degraded by acid-dependent
enzymes into metabolic fuel [2]. Under stressed
conditions, both cell survival or cell death can mediated
by autophagy, therefore, the fate of cells is dependent on
the type of cellular stress [3-5].
Beclin 1 (also called Atg6) is essential for double-

membrane autophagosome formation, which is a vital
step in autophagic nucleation [6]. Anti-apoptotic Bcl2 homologues bind to beclin 1 and negatively regulate
the autophagy induction [7]. For example, under normal
conditions Mcl-1 and beclin 1 form a complex and
prevent beclin 1 along from forming a double-membrane
autophagosome. Therefore, either downregulation of Mcl1 or the disruption of the Mcl-1–beclin 1 interaction would
be a strategy to induce autophagy [8]. In addition, by
chemical disruption of beclin 1 with other anti-apoptotic
proteins, such as Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, free beclin 1 from
the beclin 1/Bcl-2 complex can activate autophagic
effect [9, 10]. For instance, ABT737, one BH3-mimetic
compound, prevents beclin 1 from interacting with Bcl2/Bcl-XL complex then further induces autophagy [11].
Small interfering RNA screening has showed that several
mTORC1 independent signaling cascades are related to
autophagy, including STAT3, MAPK, CXCR4 [12]. In
addition, recent studies have shown that the activation
of autophagy induced by anti-cancer agents, such as
sorafenib [13], temsirolimus [14], vorinostat [15] and
obatoclax [16] is via a novel mechanism.
Obatoclax is a BH3 mimetic that can interact with
BH3 domain belonged to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family then
blocks the function of anti-apoptotic proteins and release
pro-apoptotic proteins. In preclinical studies, obatoclax
showed potent anti-tumor activity predominantly in
leukemia and myeloma cells [17, 18]. The effect of
obatoclax-induced apoptosis in lung cancer [19, 20]
and breast cancer [21], is not as potent as that seen in
leukemia. However, obatoclax has been suggested to have
a synergistic effect when used with lapatinib, a targeted
therapy for ErbB2-positive breast cancer, to induce
apoptotic and autophagic cell death in human breast and
colon cancer cells [22, 23].
We previously demonstrated that SC-2001, a
novel obatoclax derivative, shows a better apoptotic
efficacy than obatoclax in hepatocellular carcinoma cells
[24]. SC-2001 not only inhibits the function of Bcl-2
family but also regulate represses anti-apoptotic protein
expression. We further discovered a novel mechanism
by which SC-2001 activates SHP-1 phosphatase and
reduces the phosphorylation of STAT3 in HCC cells. SC2001-mediated STAT3 dephoshphorylation inhibits the
transcription activities of STAT3 and expression of its
downstream genes which induces HCC cell apoptosis.
In our paper, we revealed that SC-2001 showed
more potent effect on inducing of autophagy than the lead
compound, obatoclax, and has the different drug target.
We proved that SC-2001 can disruption of the beclin
1–Mcl-1 interaction and repressed Mcl-1 expression,
resulting in free beclin 1 for the induction of autophagy.
Further, we found that SC-2001-induced RFX-1 is
crucial to SHP-1 activation and in modulating SC2001mediated autophagy. Most important, SC-2001-indcued

demonstrated in vivo in a xenograft mouse model. Overall,
our results demonstrate the involvement of the RFX-1/
SHP-1/STAT-3 axis in SC-2001-mediated autophagy.
These findings suggest a novel molecular mechanism of
SC-2001-mediated autophagic cell death and highlight the
potential of SC-2001 in the development of RFX-1/SHP1/STAT-3-targeted anticancer therapeutics.

RESULTS
SC-2001 induces autophagic phenomena in HCC
cells
To explore the efficacy of autophagy induction
caused by obatoclax and SC-2001, we used HCC cells
as model to assess the LC3-II expression level. LC3-II
activation represents the autophagic activity. As shown
in Figure 1A, treatment with SC-2001 resulted in dosedependent induction of LC3-II to higher levels than
obatoclax in PLC5 cells. WL-2, an obatoclax derivative
without any cytotoxicity in HCC cells, was used as a
negative control. SC-2001 also exhibited the same effect
in Huh7, HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells in a time dependent
manner. Next, we applied two autophagy inhibitors to
verify that the observed autophagic effect was induced
by SC-2001. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), a widely-used
inhibitor of the initial phase of the autophagic process
prevented LC3 II formation from LC-3-I in the presence
of SC-2001. Bafilomycin A1, which inhibits the docking
and fusion process in the late stage of autophagy, resulted
in significant accumulation of LC3II in cells treated
with SC-2001 (Figure 1B). Moreover, the SC-2001induced autophagic effect was confirmed by GFP-LC3
staining. As shown in Figure 1C, PLC5 and Huh7 cells
with GFP-LC3 transfection showed increased GFPLC3II dots. In addition, autophagy as a result of SC-2001
treatment was confirmed with acridine orange staining.
Conversely, 3-MA reduced acidic vesicular organelles in
SC-2001-treated cells. (Figure 1D). Finally, the ability
of inducing autophagy by SC-2001 was verified by
electron microscopy which revealed the formation of
autophagosomes in PLC 5 and Huh7 cells (Figure 1E).

Disruption of beclin 1–Mcl-1 complex interaction
and ATG5 expression are associated with SC2001-induced autophagy
Our previous report showed that inhibition of STAT3 and downregulation Mcl-1 are key factors in SC-2001induced cell apoptosis [24]. To elucidate the biological and
pharmacological effect of SC-2001-induced autophagy, the

beclin 1 interaction and further released beclin 1 to initiate
autophagy, but did not influence the complex of beclin 1
and Bcl-2 (Figure 2A). Furthermore, the expression of
ATG5 was increased by SC-2001 in concentrate-dependent
fashion in HCC cells. On the other hand, SC-2001 showed

no influence on ATG3, ATG7 or beclin 1 in HCC cells
(Figure 2B). Genetic knockdown of beclin 1 by siRNA
reversed LC3-II production and partially rescued cell
viability (Figure 2C). Also, 3-MA reversed the reduction
of SC-2001 induced-colony formation (Figure 2D). These
data suggest that disruption the interaction between beclin

expression and reduced the status of phoshpho-STAT3
and Mcl-1 expression in a concentrate-dependent fashion
in SK-Hep-1 and PLC5 and primary HCC cells (Figure
3A). These results correlated with LC3-II production.
Moreover, overexpression of STAT3 and transiently
overexpressed Mcl-1 in PLC5 cells abolished SC-2001induced LC3II production (Figure 3B and 3C). Enhanced
SHP-1 expression synergized the effect of SC-2001
treatment on LC3-II expression (Figure 3D). In addition,
an SHP-1 inhibitor compromises the effect of SC-2001
on LC3-II (Figure 3E). Taken together, we conclude that

examine the involvement of SHP-1 induced by SC-2001

effects of SC-2001 on cell proliferation in HCC cells. The off-target effect of the si-RNA can be ruled out by comparison between the group
of no-transfection and si-scramble. Right, silencing beclin 1 by siRNA reduces the effects of SC-2001 on LC3II protein expression. The
off-target effect of the si-RNA can be ruled out by no-transfection group. D, SC-2001 treatment inhibits clonogenic survival of SK-Hep1
cells. 3-MA rescued SK-Hep1 cells from autophagic cell death induced by SC-2001 treatment. Cells were treated with SC-2001 for 48 h,

According to the literature, RFX-1 is an important
transcription factor of SHP-1 [25]. To investigate
whether RFX-1 is involved in SC-2001-induced SHP-1
expression and autophagy, we examined the expression
level of RFX-1 in HCC cells with the treatment of SC2001. As shown in Fig 3A, RFX-1 was upregulated by
SC-2001 in a concentration-dependent fashion. Next,
to examine the involvement of RFX-1 in SC-2001activated SHP-1 transcription, we applied chromatin IP
to demonstrate binding capacity. As shown in Figure 4A,
the binding activity of RFX-1 to the SHP-1 promoter was
obviously increased. Furthermore, RFX-1 silencing by
si-RNA abolished SC-2001 efficacy on SHP-1 and LC3II
expression (Figure 4B). In addition, we verified the effect

increased RFX-1 and SHP-1 levels and obviously induced
LC3-II (Figure 5C). SC-2001 treatment also activates the
SHP-1 activity in Huh7 tumors (Figure 5D). In addition,
negative regulators of autophagy including p-STAT3 and
Mcl-1 were decreased. Also, IHC staining proved the
effect of SC-2001 on autophagy (Figure 5E). We have
now demonstrated that SC-2001 considerably inhibits
tumor growth in vivo. Equally important, we discovered
that SC-2001 activated a novel RFX-1/SHP-1 autophagic

process that is triggered in response to cellular stress.
Autophagy is separated from four major processes,
initiation, nucleation, cycling, and expansion, which
involve several key genes [27]. For example, Atg1
joints with Atg13 and FIP200 in autophagy initiation. In
addition, complexs formed by beclin 1, class III (Vps34)
PI3Ks, and UVRAG are crucial for the autophagic
process [28]. Through acting jointly with beclin 1, the
pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bcl-2, Bclxl and Mcl-1 abolish autophagy initiation [10, 29, 30].
These Bcl-2 family members disrupt the beclin/Vsp34/
UVRAG complex by competitive binding with beclin 1
and inhibit autophagy. Alternatively, suppression of prosurvival Bcl-2 family members may promote autophagy
[31]. Obatoclax prevents beclin 1 from interacting with
protective Bcl-2 family members, leading to release the
free beclin/Vsp34/UVRAG complex and induction of
autophagy.
Here, we investigated the efficacy of SC-2001 and
the mechanism by which it activates autophagic effect in
HCC cells. First, by measuring LC3-I to LC3-II transition,
we found that SC-2001 induces autophagic effect in both
time- and concentration-dependent fashion. SC-2001
induced higher levels of autophagy than obatoclax. SC2001-induced autophagosome formation was verified
by electron microscopy. Moreover, after transfection of
GFP-LC3 into PLC5 and Huh7 cells, treatment with SC2001 caused GFP-LC3 puncta formation reflecting the
progression of autophagic flux. In agreement with this
result, acridine orange-stained autophagic vesicles were
shown after SC-2001 treatment in PLC5 as well as SKHep-1 cells. These results demonstrated that SC-2001 can

DISCUSSION
SC-2001 was originally derived from obatoclax as a
Bcl-2 family inhibitor against human cancers [26]. In our
previous study [24], SC-2001 was identified to be SHP1 agonist, and a negative regulator of STAT3 (which is
over-expressed in various cancers), by enhancing SHP1 expression via transcription activity. SC-2001 blocks
STAT3 phosphorylation activity, a process required for
survival and proliferation signals, and inactivates STAT3
transcription. Subsequent reduction of several regulatory
substrates of STAT3, such as cyclin D and survivin, leads
to inhibition of tumor growth mainly through induction of
apoptosis. Whether SC-2001 is involved in other types of
cell death in cancer cells, such as autophagy, was totally
unknown. In our paper, we demonstrated that SC-2001 is
a potent autophagy-inducing agent through activation of
the RFX-1/SHP-1/STAT3 axis in HCC cells.
Autophagy is a cellular catabolic degradation

induce autophagy in HCC cells.
Previously, we demonstrated that SC-2001
downregulates Mcl-1 through the SHP-1/STAT3 pathway.
Therefore, we hypothesized that SHP-1 might play an
important role in autophagy. A SHP-1 specific inhibitor
blocked SC-2001-induced LC3-II expression in HCC
cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of SHP-1 enhanced
the LC3-II expression under SC-2001 treatment in HCC
cells, indicating the involvement of SHP-1 in autophagy.
Besides the demonstration that SHP-1 modulates SC2001-activated autophagy, our results suggest RFX-1 to be
the key regulator in SC-2001-induced autophagy upstream
of the SHP-1/STAT3/Mcl-1 axis. Ectopic expression of
RFX-1 leads to subsequently enhanced effects of SC2001 on autophagy, implying its crucial role in SC-2001induced autophagic phenomenon. Conversely, RFX-1
inhibition by siRNA resulted in a reduction of SC-2001induced LC3-II. In a nude mouse xenograft model, SC2001 repressed tumor growth and the expression level of
RFX-1 and SHP-1, and LC3-II was significantly increased

in tumor cells, indicating SC-2001-induced autophagic
cell death.
It should be noted that in many instances autophagy
constitutes a cytoprotective response activated by dying
cells in the attempt to cope with stress, and its inhibition
accelerates cell death [32]. In this regards, inhibition
of autophagy may enhance the efficacy of currently
used antineoplastic agents in cancer cells and has been
suggested as a potential anti-cancer strategy [33-35]. On
the other hand, several studies have shown autophagy
may, in some circumstances, mediates the cytotoxic or
cytostatic effect of anticancer agents, in which blockade of
autophagy abolishes the therapeutic actions [36, 37]. For
example, Turcotte et al [38] reported a novel compound
STF-62247 induced autophagic cell death in renal cell
carcinoma cells. Interestingly, it has been reported that
autophagy mediated the anti-cancer effect of a natural
BH3-memimtic, (–)-gossypol, in androgen-resistant
prostate cancer cells [39] and in malignant glioma cells
[40]. It appears that autophagy plays a paradoxical role

in cell-fate decision mechanisms [36, 37]. Based on the
new, revised Nomenclature Committee of Cell Death
(NCCD) classification on cell death in 2012 [32], Galluzzi
et al reintroduced the term ‘autophagic cell death’ to
indicate a cell death that is mediated by autophagy and
can be suppressed by the inhibition of the autophagic
pathway. On the basis of the NCCD 2012 definition, all
cases of cell death that exhibit markers of autophagy
but cannot be blocked by autophagy inhibition (such as
RNAi targeting beclin 1, or inhibitors of Vps34, a class
III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) should not be
classified as autophagic cell death [32]. Accordingly, our
current study showed that SC-2001-induced autophagy
in association with cytotoxic/cytostatic effects can be
suppressed by Beclin 1 (Figure 2C) or by 3-MA, a broadspectrum PI3-kinase inhibitor (Figure 1B, 1D, and 2D). In
addition, we have added supplementary data showing SC2001 promotes cancer cell death (Supplementary figure 1).
Our current data suggest autophagy mediates part of the
anti-cancer effects of SC-2001 in HCC cells. Moreover,
our previous study has shown that SC-2001 induces
apoptosis by modulating SHP-1/pSTAT3 mechanism in
HCC cells [24]. Collectively, we suggest that SC-2001
not only induces apoptosis, but is also able to induce
autophagic cell death. We have added a comprehensive
plot to provide current known drug mechanisms of SC2001 (Supplementary figure 2).
We conclude that SC-2001 induces autophagy
in novel RFX-1/SHP-1/STAT3/MCL-1 mechanism:
RFX-1-dependent Mcl-1 downregulation. This study
identifies RFX-1 as a major mediator of SC-2001-induced
autophagy and indicates that RFX-1 may play a tumor
suppressor role in HCC. Modification of SC-2001 as a
RFX-1 agonist might have clinical effect in the treatment
of human HCC.

The Huh-7 HCC cell line was obtained from the
Health Science Research Resources Bank (HSRRB,

ATCC were immediately expanded and frozen such that all
cell lines could be restarted every 3 months from a frozen
vial of the same batch of cells. No further authentication
was conducted in our laboratory. Cells were maintained

at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Primary cancer
cells from consenting patients were also analyzed. Study
protocols were approved by the institutional review board

STAT3 cDNA was purchased from Origene
(Origene, RC215836). STAT3-overexpresed PLC5 cells
derived from a single stable clone were prepared for
evaluating the major target of SC-2001. Briefly, following
transfection, cells were cultured in the presence of 0.8 mg/
mL G418 (Gibco, Invitrogen, 11811-031) according to
previous reports [42]. After 8 weeks of selection, surviving
colonies, i.e., those arising from stably transfected cells
were selected and individually amplified. Mcl-1 (Addgene,
25375) or RFX-1 (Genecoeopia, EX-P0104-M29) were
transiently overexpressed by transfection technique in
PLC5 cells, respectively.

were incubated with 2 μg RFX1 antibodies, which were
generated from rabbit, or nonspecific rabbit IgG (Cell
signaling, #3900). The immunoprecipitated products
were washed sequentially with low-salt immune complex
wash buffer, high-salt immune complex wash buffer, LiCl
immune complex wash buffer, and twice with TE buffer.
The chromatin was eluted from the agarose by incubating
with elution buffer (1% SDS, 100mM NaHCO3); and the
DNA–protein complexes were reversely cross-linked by
high-salt solution containing 200 mM NaCl at 65°C for
at least 5 h. To eliminate contaminations of proteins and
RNAs, the mixture was treated with 10 mg RNase A at
37°C for 30 min and then treated with protease K for 2
h at 45°C. Finally, the precipitated DNA was recovered
using the spin column provided in the ChIP kit, and eluted
with 50 ml elution buffer. PCR reaction was conducted
using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, 4398881). Two
microliters of the precipitated DNA was used as template.
The sequence of the primers used in the ChIP assay were
as follows: 5′-CCTCTTGCAGGTGTCCTTAAG-3′, and
5′-TGGAAAGGCAGAGGGAATCAG-3′.

A RediPlate 96 EnzChek Tyrosine Phosphatase
Assay Kit (Molecular probe, R-22067) was used for SHP1 activity assay. The method was as described previously
[43].

Colony formation assay
SK-Hep1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (~10005000 cells per well) and subjected to the indicated
treatments, with the drug being removed to terminate the
treatment. Two weeks later, plates were washed in PBS,
fixed with 100% methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, E7023) and
stained with a filtered solution of 5% w/v crystal violet
(crystal violet, Sigma-Aldrich, C3886). After washing
with tap water, the colonies were counted both manually
(by eye) and digitally using a ColCount automated colony
counter.

Autophagy analysis

TUNEL assay

The following methods were used to assess druginduced autophagic cell death: (1) Western blot analysis of
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3 II) as
described previously [2, 44]; and (2) electron microscopy.
Samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution
buffer in PBS at 4°C for 1 h, postfixed in 1% osmium
tetroxide solution at 4°C for 3 h, dehydrated in graded
concentrations of ethanol and embedded in LR white resin
(Sigma-Aldrich, 62661). Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were
examined with a JEOL JEM-1400EX electron microscope
at 120 Kv. Representative areas were recorded at 20,000,
40,000 magniﬁcation; (3) Immunofluorescence of acridine
orange (Sigma-Aldrich, A6014). HCC cells were grown
on coverslips. After being washed with PBS, cells were
treated with 2 µM SC-2001 or SC-2001+3-MA for 48 h,
fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich,
P6148) for 30 minutes at room temperature then stained
with acridine orange (5 μg/ml) for 5 minutes at room
temperature. Cells were examined under a Leica DM2500
fluorescence microscope.

The TUNEL assay is performed according to
the manufacture’s instruction (AAT Bioquest, 22844).
Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plate. After cells
were attached to the plate, cells were treated with SC2001 as indicated concentration for 48 h. After that, cells
were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde for 20 minutes at
room temperature and then washed with PBS. Each well
was incubated with TUNEL reaction buffer provided by
commercial kit for 1 h at 37°C. The fluorescence intensity
was measured by fluorescence microplate  reader at Ex/
Em = 550/590 nm after incubation.

Xenograft tumor growth
Male NCr athymic nude mice (5-7 weeks of age)
were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal
Center (Taipei, Taiwan). All experimental procedures
using these mice were performed in accordance with
protocols approved by National Taiwan University. When
Huh7 tumors reached 150 mm3, mice received SC-2001
(20 mg/kg) orally (every other day). Controls received
vehicle.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) Assay
The CHIP assay was performed according to the EZ
ChIP chromatin immunoprecipitation (Merck Millipore,
17-371) and EZ-Zyme Chromatin Prep Kit (Merck
Millipore, 17-375) manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, after
cross-linking with 17.5% paraformaldehyde, PLC5 cells
were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in
lysis buffer. The DNA was fragmented to about 200–500
base pairs by the EZ-Zyme. Approximately 5 × 106 cells
were used per CHIP assay and the resulting DNA fragments
