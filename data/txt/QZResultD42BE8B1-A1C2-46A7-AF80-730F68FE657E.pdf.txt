Abstract
GMX1778 and its prodrug GMX1777 represent a new class of cancer drugs that targets nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) as a new strategy to interfere with biosynthesis of the key enzymatic
cofactor NAD, which is critical for a number of cell functions, including DNA repair. Using a genome-wide
synthetic lethal siRNA screen, we identiﬁed the folate pathway–related genes, deoxyuridine triphosphatase and
dihydrofolate reductase, the silencing of which sensitized non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells to the
cytotoxic effects of GMX. Pemetrexed is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase currently used to treat patients
with nonsquamous NSCLC. We found that combining pemetrexed with GMX1777 produced a synergistic
therapeutic beneﬁt in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells in vitro and in a mouse A549 xenograft model of lung
cancer. Pemetrexed is known to activate PARPs, thereby accelerating NAD consumption. Genetic or pharmacologic blockade of PARP activity inhibited this effect, impairing cell death by pemetrexed either alone or in
combination with GMX1777. Conversely, inhibiting the base excision repair pathway accentuated NAD decline in
response to GMX and the cytotoxicity of both agents either alone or in combination. These ﬁndings provide a
mechanistic rationale for combining GMX1777 with pemetrexed as an effective new therapeutic strategy to treat
nonsquamous NSCLC. Cancer Res; 74(21); 5948–54. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Interest in nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)
as a potential anticancer target stems from its involvement
as the major and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of NADþ
(1, 2). Tumor cells have elevated NAMPT expression and are
dependent on NADþ and ATP to support the increased metabolic demands of rapid cell proliferation. As a cellular
response to DNA damage, PARP is activated and consumes
its substrate NADþ for the poly-(ADP-ribosylation) (PAR) of
proteins (3). In this way, it contributes to increased NADþ
demands to support the ongoing DNA repair mechanisms in
cancer cells. GMX1778 (formerly CHS-828) is a competitive
inhibitor of NAMPT whose potency for NAMPT in vitro and

cell growth inhibition is in the low nanomolar range (4).
GMX1777 is a soluble prodrug of GMX used for in vivo studies
(5, 6). NAMPT inhibitors, including GMX1778 (GMX) and
FK866, have shown preclinical activity alone and in combination with several therapeutic DNA-damaging agents, but the
mechanism of synergy has not been clearly elucidated (7–10).
Here, we report a synthetic lethal screen that revealed
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and deoxyuridine triphosphatase (DUT) as genes that modulate cell sensitivity to GMX in
A549 non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. Pemetrexed (PTX) is a multitargeted antifolate that inhibits DHFR,
thymidylate synthase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide transferase, and is currently approved for treatment of nonsquamous NSCLC (11). We demonstrate that GMX synergizes with
PTX in vitro and in the A549 lung adenocarcinoma xenograft
model. The combination is most efﬁcacious when PTX precedes GMX. The mechanism of synergy involves a PARP-1–
mediated accelerated and sustained NADþ decline that results
in enhanced cytotoxicity.

and olaparib (AZD2281) from Selleckchem. Methoxyamine
(MX), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and folic acid
were from Sigma-Aldrich.
Genome-wide synthetic lethal screen
A549 cells were reverse transfected with 20 nmol/L of human
On-Target Plus Smart pool genome-wide library (Dharmacon)
using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions in replicates of 12 (4 wells  3 plates). Controls
included siNT (D-001810-10-20), siPLK-1 (L-003290-00), and
siGAPDH (L-004253-00) as nontargeting, transfection, and
sensitizing siRNA pools respectively. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or a dose range of
GMX in duplicate. Three days after treatment, cell viability was
measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability
Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
See Supplementary Methods for data analysis.
Transfections, antibodies, and Western blot analyses
siRNAs (20 nmol/L) targeting DHFR (pool, L-008799; Dharmacon; individual SI00299992; Qiagen), DUT (pool, L-010258;
Dharmacon), and PARP-1 (SI02662996; Qiagen) or NAMPT
(L-004581; Dharmacon) were transfected into A549 cells using
RNAiMax (Invitrogen) as above. Protein was extracted from
cells 48 hours after transfection and detected by Western
blotting using antibodies to DHFR (EPR5285; Abcam), DUT
(AB137097; Abcam), PARP-1 (9542; Cell Signaling Technology),
a-tubulin (DM1A; Sigma), g-H2AX (05-636; Millipore), or PAR
proteins (MAB3192; Millipore).
Drug combination effects and viability assays
Cells were treated for 72 hours for simultaneous treatments
or 48 hours followed by 72 hours for sequential treatments.
Serial dilutions of GMX and/or PTX were added to microtiter
plates (ﬁnal DMSO 0.2%). Cell viability was determined using
CellTiter-Glo. The combination index was determined using
CompuSyn v1.0 (Biosoft) according to the method of Chou and
Talalay (12).
Murine xenografts
Female SCID hairless outbred (Crl:SHO-Prkdcscid Hrhr)
mice (6–8–week-old, Charles River Laboratories) were injected
subcutaneously with 107 A549 cells in a 1:1 PBS/HC Matrigel
(BD) suspension . At a mean tumor volume of 100 mm3, animals
were administered PTX i.p. daily for 5 days (600 mg/kg/day in
0.9% saline) or GMX1777 i.m. daily for 5 days (150 mg/kg/day in
5% dextrose), appropriate vehicle, or a combination of these.
Differences in tumor volumes between treatment groups were
compared with a one-way analysis of variance using Prism 5.0
(GraphPad).
NADþ/NADH, NADPþ, ATP, and intact cell quantitation
NADþ/NADH, ATP, and intact cells were quantiﬁed using
the NADþ/NADH-Glo, CellTiter-Glo, and CellTiter-Fluor assay
kits respectively (Promega) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. To quantify NADþ/NADPþ by LC-MS/MS, cells
were washed in cold ammonium formate, lysed in 50% aceto-

nitrile, then mixed in a bead beater for 2 minutes. Lipids were
partitioned from extracts with chloroform and following centrifugation (5 minutes, 3,000  g), the aqueous layer was
removed and dried by vacuum centrifuge. Samples were
resuspended in 15 mmol/L ammonium formate in 50% acetonitrile and injected for LC-MS/MS analysis (6430 Triple
Quadrupole; Agilent Technologies). See Supplementary Methods for detailed LC-MS/MS parameters. NADþ/NADPþ levels
were normalized to total protein in each sample quantiﬁed by
the BCA protein assay (Pierce).

Results and Discussion
To identify modulators of NAMPT inhibitor sensitivity, a
genome-wide functional genomic screen was performed in the
A549 NSCLC cell line. Drug sensitivity was assayed with a dose
range of GMX in duplicate for each siRNA pool (4 siRNAs/gene/
well). The IC50 of GMX for each siRNA pool was compared with
the mean IC50 of nontargeting (NT) controls on each plate (Fig.
1A). The siRNA pool targeting DHFR was the top sensitizer
(after the drug's own target NAMPT) with an 18-fold decrease
in the GMX IC50 value. Protein knockdown and sensitization
were conﬁrmed in a secondary assay with two different sources
of siRNAs targeting DHFR (Fig. 1B). Speciﬁc knockdown of
DUT, another folate pathway enzyme, also sensitized A549 to
GMX (Supplementary Fig. S1).
DHFR is inhibited by the non–small cell lung chemotherapeutic PTX. As the DHFR screen results would suggest, the
combination of PTX with GMX treatment is strongly synergistic in A549 and H1299 NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell lines
(Fig. 2A and B). Synergy from the sequential drug combination
was also seen in additional cell lines (Supplementary Table S1).
The synergy is more pronounced in both lines if PTX treatment
precedes GMX treatment by 48 hours. The reverse experiment,
knocking down NAMPT, also sensitizes to PTX treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In an A549 xenograft model, the
administration of PTX (daily  5) preceded 48 hours by
GMX1777 treatment (daily  5) results in a synergistic antitumor effect without signiﬁcant toxicity (10% weight loss) for
any single agent or combination treatment group (Fig. 2C).
This demonstrates the potential clinical impact of this novel
drug combination.
Antifolates such as PTX as well as nonfunctional DUT leads to
an imbalance in dUTP/dTTP nucleotide pools and dUTP misincorporation followed by activation of base excision repair
(BER), which leads to single strand DNA damage, that if unrepaired, results in double-strand DNA breaks (DSB; refs. 13, 14).
Because PARP activation is involved in the BER and DSB repair
pathways (15), we sought to examine the activation of PARP in
response to PTX. Figure 3A demonstrates that robust protein
PAR occurs 44 hours following PTX treatment that lasts until at
least 72 hours. This demonstrates that PARP is activated and is
consuming NADþ at 48 hours following a sublethal dose (150
nmol/L) of PTX treatment. Of note, the total NADþ decline
following treatment with PTX is modest over a 72-hour treatment compared with the decline in NADþ from either lethal (25
nmol/L) or sublethal (6 nmol/L) doses of GMX (Fig. 3B).
Although NADþ levels decline with similar kinetics with both
lethal and sublethal doses of GMX, they can recover only at

Figure 1. A functional genomic screen identiﬁes genes involved in sensitivity to GMX cytotoxic effects. A, A549 cells were transfected with a genome-wide
siRNA library and treated 48 hours later with a dose range of GMX. Viability was measured after 72 hours of GMX treatment by CellTiter-Glo. The IC50
for siRNAs screened are expressed relative to the mean of four nontargeting control siRNAs screened on each plate in rank order. B, DHFR siRNA was

nonlethal doses. This suggests that cell fate is determined by a
reduction in NADþ beyond a threshold concentration and/or
duration. In support of these hypotheses, GMX has a steep dose–
response viability curve in vitro, suggesting that a threshold effect
(4) and sustained exposure to GMX is required for maximal
cytotoxic effect (5). We, therefore, reasoned that the combined
effects of increased NADþ utilization through simultaneous
PARP activation and inhibition of NADþ biosynthesis would be
enhanced in PTX þ GMX–treated cells. Indeed, when the two
agents are combined in sequence, with PTX followed by GMX,
the steady-state NADþ and NADPþ decline is greater than
additive (Fig. 3C) and the rate of NADþ decline is enhanced
(Fig. 3D). Similar effects have been observed for the combination
of FK866 with MNNG, or temozolomide (7, 16). Overall, the
combination results in a more sustained NADþ inhibition, and
notably, a more rapid impact on ATP decline and cytotoxic effect.

NAMPT enzyme, can bypass the activity of NAMPT inhibi-

tors and rescue GMX-mediated cytotoxicity (4). NMN has
been detected in plasma (17). Although NMN does not affect
PTX cytotoxicity, it partially rescues cell death caused by
the GMX alone or in combination with PTX (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Similarly, the addition of folate completely
abolishes the cytotoxic effects of PTX and the PTX þ GMX
combination (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Therefore, regulators of intracellular and extracellular NMN levels, as well as
folate supplementation, could affect the efﬁcacy of NAMPT
inhibitor–containing therapies.
To determine if the PTX/GMX synergy is mediated through
PARP, cells were treated with PTX and GMX in the presence or
absence of olaparib, a small-molecule PARP inhibitor (Fig. 4A
and B; ref. 18) or following siRNA knockdown of PARP-1
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). Treatment with olaparib
was sufﬁcient to inhibit PTX-induced PAR and NADþ depletion. It was also sufﬁcient to partially restore NADþ levels in the
PTX/GMX-treated cells above the threshold level such that

viability was also restored from 22% to 68%. SiRNA knockdown
of PARP-1 completely inhibited PTX-mediated PAR and partially restored viability to the PTX/GMX-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), demonstrating that the synergy is
mediated in part through PARP-1. Of note, by eliminating the
PARP substrate, NADþ, GMX functionally mimics a PARP
inhibitor and prevents PTX-induced PAR (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4B); no PAR occurs following GMX treatment
alone, as expected (Fig 4B and D). GMX does not prevent the
induction of DSB by PTX as measured by g-H2AX levels (Fig.
4B), and, thus, does not interfere with the DNA-damaging
aspects of PTX cytotoxicity or the cell's demand for NADþ.

Figure 4C and D demonstrate that the BER inhibitor
methoxyamine enhances the NADþ/NADH-depleting effects
of GMX and the GMX/PTX combination. Methoxyamine
consequently enhances the cytotoxicity of PTX and GMX
alone, as well as the combination of the two (Fig. 4D).
Methoxyamine has been previously shown to enhance
PTX-induced accumulation of DSBs and cytotoxicity (19).
This suggests that a BER-inhibiting agent such as methoxyamine may enhance the cytotoxic effects of the GMX-PTX
combination, both by increasing NADþ depletion and DNA
damage and may be a useful addition to this combination
strategy.

sensor and in the repair mechanism. Mortusewicz and colleagues demonstrated that initial PARP recruitment and activation generates PAR-modiﬁed binding sites on PARP-1 and on
histones near the site of DNA damage, recruiting and activating
additional PARP-1 for a second and enhanced wave of PARP-1
activation following irradiation DNA damage (20). This suggests why pretreatment with PTX may result in a more
profound combination effect than when the two agents are
added simultaneously or if GMX is added ﬁrst. This work
demonstrates the potential for the combination of NAMPT
inhibitors with various PARP-activating therapeutic agents (in
addition to PTX) in clinical settings and that the schedule of
administration may inﬂuence the treatment efﬁcacy.
