Abstract
The redeployed drug combination of bezaﬁbrate and
medroxyprogesterone acetate (designated BaP) has potent
in vivo anticancer activity in acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML) and endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) patients; however, its mechanism-of-action is unclear. Given that elevated
fatty acid biosynthesis is a hallmark of many cancers and that
these drugs can affect lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that
BaP exerts anticancer effects by disrupting lipogenesis. We
applied mass spectrometry–based lipidomics and gene and
protein expression measurements of key lipogenic enzymes
[acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN),
and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)] to AML and eBL cell
lines treated with BaP. BaP treatment decreased fatty acid and
phospholipid biosynthesis from 13C D-glucose. The proportion
of phospholipid species with saturated and monounsaturated

acyl chains was also decreased after treatment, whereas those
with polyunsaturated chains increased. BaP decreased SCD1
protein levels in each cell line (0.46- to 0.62-fold; P < 0.023)
and decreased FASN protein levels across all cell lines (0.87fold decrease; P ¼ 1.7  104). Changes to ACC1 protein levels
were mostly insigniﬁcant. Supplementation with the SCD1
enzymatic product, oleate, rescued AML and e-BL cells from
BaP cell killing and decreased levels of BaP-induced reactive
oxygen species, whereas supplementation with the SCD1 substrate (and FASN product), palmitate, did not rescue cells. In
conclusion, these data suggest that the critical anticancer actions of
BaP are decreases in SCD1 levels and monounsaturated fatty acid
synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that clinically
available antileukemic and antilymphoma drugs targeting SCD1
have been reported. Cancer Res; 75(12); 2530–40. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

low toxicity are screened for efﬁcacy against cancers (4). This
approach has already been successful in reducing mortality
in hematologic malignancies (5, 6). Using this method, we
previously identiﬁed that the combination of the lipid lowering
drug, bezaﬁbrate, and the contraceptive, medroxyprogesterone
acetate (MPA), has potent and cancer cell selective in vitro anticancer effects against AML, eBL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells (7–10). The potency of
this combination (denoted BaP) extended to the clinic demonstrating efﬁcacy with low toxicity in clinical trials in AML (trial
registration number ISRCTN50635541; ref. 11) and eBL patients
(ISRCTN34303497; ref. 12). In vitro, BaP induces intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells, which is thought to
be important for cell killing (8–10); however, as yet, we do not
have a complete mechanism that fully explains the action of BaP
against these diverse hematologic malignancies.
Both bezaﬁbrate and MPA individually alter lipid metabolism (13, 14); however, nothing is known about their combinatorial effect on lipogenesis. We hypothesized that regulation
of lipid metabolism could be an important component of BaP
anticancer activity given that abnormally rapid lipogenesis is
considered to be a hallmark of most cancers (15, 16). Elevated
lipogenesis in tumor cells is at least partly caused by high rates
of fatty acid biosynthesis (15–18), a phenomenon also
observed in hematologic malignancies (19, 20). Enzymes that
synthesize saturated fatty acids [acetyl CoA carboxylase 1
(ACC1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN)] and monounsaturated

Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and endemic Burkitt
lymphoma (eBL) are two aggressive and biologically very distinct
blood cancers that kill patients quickly if untreated. AML mainly
affects elderly patients, who often cannot tolerate routine highgrade cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment (1, 2). eBL is a B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma predominantly affecting children in equatorial Africa. It responds well to high-grade chemotherapy; however, the high costs of treatment and supportive care often
preclude their use in the endemic setting (3). Thus, in elderly
AML patients in high-income countries and eBL patients in lowincome countries, there is an urgent need for inexpensive treatments that selectively kill tumor cells with low systemic toxicity.
One approach is drug redeployment where existing drugs with

Antilipogenic Leukemia Therapy Targets SCD1

fatty acids [stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)] are often overexpressed in malignant cells, and selective inhibition of these
enzymes exerts an anticancer effect in vitro (18, 20–24). Accelerated fatty acid synthesis may permit faster growth of tumor
cells. Furthermore, synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids
may have additional beneﬁts as it has been shown that oleate
can protect cells against saturated fatty acid toxicity and cellular
stress (25, 26). FASN, ACC1, and SCD1 have therefore been
identiﬁed as plausible targets for cancer therapy, but agents
shown to decrease their activities in the laboratory have yet to
be translated to the clinic.
Here, we have investigated the effect of BaP on lipid metabolism in AML- and eBL-derived cell lines by measuring changes to
the lipidome and lipid synthesis from 13C-labeled D-glucose using
direct-infusion Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry. We also measured mRNA and protein
levels of key lipogenic enzymes. We show that BaP slows de novo
fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis, which appears to be
achieved by downregulation of lipogenic enzymes, particularly
SCD1, at the gene and protein levels. External provision of SCD1
product oleate rescued both AML and eBL cell lines from killing by
BaP. This suggests that the dysregulation of lipogenesis is a key
component of the anticancer action of BaP.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
AML (K562 and HL60; European Collection of Cell Cultures)
and Burkitt lymphoma (BL31 and Glor; gift from A.B. Rickinson,
University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom) cell
lines were maintained in exponential growth (between 0.25 and
1.5  106 cells/mL) at 37 C with 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium
(containing 2 g/L D-glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin (Gibco-Invitrogen).
Drug treatments
Unless speciﬁed, cells were seeded at 2.5  105 cells/mL (AML)
or 5  105 cells/mL (BL) in ﬂasks (Falcon) and treated for 24
hours with either: BaP (0.5 mmol/L bezaﬁbrate and 5 mmol/L
MPA; Sigma-Aldrich); 0.5 mmol/L bezaﬁbrate; 5 mmol/L MPA;
or solvent control (ethanol and DMSO). DMSO and ethanol
was at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 in 1,000 in all classes. The
13
C D-glucose tracer study was set in glucose-free RPMI-1640
(Gibco-Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 g/L 1-13C D-glucose
(Sigma-Aldrich). Where indicated, HL60 cells were treated with
a commercial SCD1 inhibitor (4-(2-Chlorophenoxy)-N-[3[(methylamino)carconyl]phenyl]-1-piperidinecarboxamide;
ab142089; Abcam; 10 nmol/L).
Metabolomics/lipidomics cell quenching and extraction
Cell quenching (to rapidly halt metabolic activity) was done as
described (27) with minor modiﬁcations. Cell suspensions were
centrifuged (250  g, 5 minutes, 20 C) and supernatant was
discarded. Cell pellets were resuspended in residual media, of
which 200 mL was added to 1.6-mL 60% methanol on dry ice
(40 C) and then centrifuged (2,500  g, 5 minutes, 9 C).
Supernatant was discarded and cell pellet weighed and transferred
to a 80 C freezer until extraction. Polar metabolites and lipids
were extracted from cell pellets using a modiﬁed Bligh-Dyer
procedure (28, 29) using 8-mL methanol/mg biomass, 8-mL chlo-

www.aacrjournals.org

roform/mg biomass, and 7.2-mL water/mg biomass. The polar
phase (100 mL) was dried in a centrifugal concentrator and the
nonpolar phase (100 mL) was dried under nitrogen. Both were
kept at 80 C until analysis.
Mass spectrometry analysis and data processing
Dried samples were resuspended in either: 50 mL 80:20
methanol:water with 20 mmol/L ammonium acetate (polar
extracts), or 200 mL 2:1 methanol:chloroform with 5 mmol/L
ammonium acetate (nonpolar extracts). All analyses were conducted by direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS), using a
Triversa nanoelectrospray system (Advion Biosciences; þ1.7 kV/
1.7 kV—positive/negative ion mode, 0.3-psi backing pressure)
and a hybrid linear ion trap FT-ICR mass spectrometer (LTQ FT
Ultra; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) using resolutions of 100,000 to
400,000 (at 400 m/z). Each sample was collected as transient
data in triplicate using the selected ion monitoring (SIM) stitch
approach (Supplementary Data; ref. 30). To measure phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine phospholipids, a novel
DIMS approach, termed tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS)stitch, was used comprising collision-induced dissociation (CID;
80-eV collision energy) fragmentation of phospholipid ions,
resulting in characteristic neutral losses from phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine lipids and thereby aiding their
identiﬁcation (see Supplementary Data and Supplementary
Fig. S1). SIM stitch transient data were averaged, Fourier transformed, and internally calibrated (Supplementary Tables S1–S4)
in MATLAB (Mathworks; ref. 30). For each sample, peaks were
retained if they were present in at least two of the triplicate
analyses. When collating samples into a data matrix, peaks were
retained if they were present in at least 50% of all samples (31).
Data matrices were probabilistic quotient normalized (32). Prior
to principal components analysis (PCA), a generalized log
transformation (l ¼ 7.3  1011) was applied (33).
Mass spectral peak annotation
Peaks were putatively annotated using KEGG (http://www.
genome.jp/kegg/) and LIPID MAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org)
databases in conjunction with MI-Pack software (34). Annotation m/z tolerance was 1 ppm (for peaks < 500 m/z) and 3
ppm (500–1,000 m/z). For the DIMS approach, fatty acids,
phospholipids, and lysophospholipids were identiﬁed as
[MH], except phosphatidycholine and lysophosphatidycholine that ionized as an acetate adduct ([MþOAc]). Diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) were identiﬁed as
[MþNH4]þ. Polar metabolites were identiﬁed as [MH],
[MþOAc], or [MþNaOAc-H]. For the MSMS-stitch DIMS
approach, phosphatidylcholine was identiﬁed as [MCH3]
and phosphatidylserine was identiﬁed as [MC3H5NO2-H].
The identities of phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) were conﬁrmed by CID MSn on the LTQ
FT Ultra (35 eV; Supplementary Fig. S2).

C D-glucose tracer study data analysis
The 13C isotopes of fatty acids and phospholipids were
assigned by looking for multiple additions of 1.003355 m/z
to the 12C parent peak. To establish the amount of each compound that came from 13C D-glucose, the intensity of all the
13
C isotope peaks was summed minus the naturally occurring
13
C intensity from the 12C peak. Naturally occurring 13C (1.1%
abundance) was calculated: (12C intensity  1.1  number of

calculated for 13C1, 13C2 . . . 13Cn peaks.
cDNA preparation and quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was extracted from 4  106 cells using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen) and quantiﬁed on a NanoDrop (Thermo Scientiﬁc). RNA quality was assessed using A260/280 nm and A260/
230 nm ratios measured by the NanoDrop. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using preoptimized
QuantiTect Primer Assays (Qiagen) and a SensiMix SYBR
Low-ROX Kit (Bioline) on an Agilent Mx3005P quantitative
PCR (qPCR) cycler. 18S rRNA was used as an internal standard
for cDNA. The qPCR cycle protocol included an initial heating
at 95 C for 10 minutes, then 44 cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds,
55 C for 15 seconds and 72 C for 20 seconds, then a ﬁnal cycle
of 95 C for 1 minutes, 55 C for 30 seconds and 95 C for 30
seconds. Delta cycle threshold (DCt) values were calculated by
subtracting 18S Ct from test gene Ct. Relative mRNA levels were
determined by subtraction of control DCt values from treatment
DCt values to give a DDCt value. This was inverse logged (2DDCt)
to generate relative fold changes.
Western blotting
Cells treated with drugs for 24 hours were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Thirty micrograms of
protein was combined with Laemmli 4 loading dye (Bio-Rad)
and 10% b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and heated at 70 C (5
minutes), and then separated on SDS-PAGE precast gradient gels
(4%–15%; Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P
membrane (Millipore Corp.) and probed with 1/1,000 dilution of
anti-SCD1 (ab19862; Abcam), anti-ACC1 (4190; New England
Biolabs), anti-phospho-ACC Ser79 (11818; New England Biolabs), and anti-FASN (ab22759; Abcam). Detection was by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse diluted
at 1/1,000 and ECL using Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Loading controls used anti-b-actin antibody (Sigma) diluted at 1/25,000 and anti-mouse-HRP secondary at 1/25,000. Densitometry was performed using the ImageJ
software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) and protein expression normalized to b-actin.
Palmitate and oleate supplementation and measurement of cell
viability
To generate soluble fatty acid stocks, palmitic acid (7.5 mmol/L)
was complexed to bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1.5 mmol/L;
Sigma) as described (35) and oleic acid (3 mmol/L) was purchased
precomplexed to BSA (1.5 mmol/L; Sigma). Vehicle control stock
of 1.5-mmol/L BSA was created. Cells were set in 100-mL cultures in
96-well ﬂat-bottomed plates, with starting cell counts of 5,000
(AML) or 10,000 (Burkitt lymphoma) cells per well. Cells were
treated with BaP and escalating concentrations of palmitic or
oleate. After 48 hours, a further 100 mL of media was added,
including reapplication of BaP and the fatty acids. After 96 hours,
the 200-mL volume of cells was removed into a ﬂow cytometry
tube, centrifuged (250  g) and supernatant discarded. FACS ﬁx
(200 mL; 1% formaldehyde, 2% FBS) and 20-mL (20,000 beads)
CytoCount beads (Dako) were added, the sample vortexed (10
seconds), and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (FACSCalibur ﬂow
cytometer; Becton Dickenson). A minimum of 1,000 bead events

2532 Cancer Res; 75(12) June 15, 2015

were collected and ratio of the beads to the number viable cells in
the forward/side scatter plots was proportional to the cell density.
Cell death (after 96 hours) was measured by FACSCalibur ﬂow
cytometry (Becton Dickenson) using the Annexin V/propidium
iodide kit (Becton Dickenson) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Measurement of ROS
After drug treatment, 200 mL of cell suspension (approximately
1  105 cells) was incubated at 37 C with 20 ,70 -dichloroﬂuorescin
diacetate (DCFDA; Sigma) for 1 hour. The oxidized product 20 ,70 dichloroﬂuorescein (DCF) was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer and
CellQuest software (Becton Dickenson). Relative ROS levels were
calculated as DCF ﬂuorescence intensity relative to untreated
control cells.
Statistical analysis
PCA was conducted using PLS_Toolbox (Eigenvector) in
MATLAB. Statistical outliers were deﬁned as samples that
fell outside the 95% conﬁdence limit on the PCA Q residuals
and/or Hotelling axes. Univariate statistics composed of twotailed t tests or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc testing
where more than two sample classes were tested (in Minitab 17).
Where multiple tests were applied in the metabolomics/lipidomics datasets, a false discovery rate (FDR) of <10% was used to
correct for multiple hypothesis testing (36). Intensity changes
between treatments are expressed as average fold changes. All bar
charts represent the mean  the standard error of the mean (SEM)
unless indicated.

Results
BaP treatment of AML cell lines perturbs the
phospholipidome
Negative ion DIMS ([]DIMS) analysis of lipid extracts from
HL60 and K562 AML cells revealed that the majority of the
abundant peaks were between 600 and 1000 m/z and attributable
to intact phospholipids (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Lipid extracts from HL60 and K562 cells treated for 24 hours
with either BaP (combination of 0.5-mmol/L bezaﬁbrate and 5mmol/L MPA) or solvent control were analyzed by []DIMS. As
reported previously, at 24 hours, BaP had little effect on cell
viability (9), so any changes observed in the lipidome reﬂect
changes upstream of cell differentiation or death. The PCA scores
plot of the []DIMS data demonstrated the major segregation to
be between HL60 and K562 cells along principal component 1
(Fig. 1B). This is not surprising, given that the cell lines were
derived from different individuals with distinct forms of AML
(HL60 are de novo AML M2 cells and K562 are AML cells derived
from a chronic myeloid leukemia patient undergoing blast crisis;
ref. 37, 38). Despite these baseline differences, both cell lines
displayed a uniform response to BaP along principal component
2 (Fig. 1B). The PCA scores plot of 24-hour treatment of HL60 cells
with 0.5-mmol/L bezaﬁbrate, 5-mmol/L MPA, or the combination
demonstrated that bezaﬁbrate contributed most to the BaP effect
(Fig. 1C). However, MPA-treated samples were signiﬁcantly different to control samples along principal component 1 (P ¼
0.004), as were bezaﬁbrate and BaP samples (P ¼ 0.013), indicating that MPA is required to generate the lipid perturbation
proﬁle observed with BaP treatment (Fig. 1C).

after BaP treatment (see

fold change of each individual

24-hour BaP treatment
(Supplementary Table S5). Filled
blocks represent a phosphatidylcholine
species that was detected, and the
position on the plot reﬂects the total
number of carbons and double bonds in
both acyl chains of that species.

The quantities of the four major diacyl-phospholipid
classes (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine) were relatively unchanged after 24-hour BaP treatment of HL60 or K562
cells (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Table S5). Both cell lines
were signiﬁcantly depleted of lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine after BaP treatment
(Fig. 1D and Supplementary Table S5). Lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine are major breakdown
products of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, respectively, and a decrease in their steady-state concentrations might indicate a decrease in the rate of phospholipid
turnover.
In addition, BaP treatment induced a consistent perturbation of
the phospholipid acyl chain composition in HL60 and K562 cells.
This is illustrated in Fig. 1E (and Supplementary Table S5) that
shows the relative fold changes of individual phosphatidylcholine species in BaP-treated cells compared with control cells. The
relative proportions of phosphatidylcholine species with saturated and monounsaturated chains were decreased and those with
polyunsaturated chains were increased (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Table S5). This suggested that in the presence of BaP, HL60

www.aacrjournals.org

and K562 cells had lower de novo synthesis of saturated and
monounsaturated fatty acids.
BaP treatment decreases fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis
and increases triacylglycerol levels
Glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and diacylglycerol (DAG) are
intermediates in the de novo phospholipid biosynthetic pathway:
two fatty acyl chains are added to G3P-generating phosphatidate,
which can then be dephosphorylated to generate DAG. []DIMS
analysis of polar extracts of HL60 and K562 cells treated with BaP
for 24 hours showed elevated steady-state levels of G3P and
positive ion DIMS ([þ]DIMS) analysis of lipid extracts identiﬁed
depleted DAG levels (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S6). This
suggested phospholipid synthesis may be disrupted at the acyl
chain addition stage. In contrast, the concentrations of triacylglycerol (TAG) were substantially increased in BaP-treated cells
(Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S6).
C18:1 was the most abundant of the four observed free fatty
acids in HL60 cells (Fig. 2B), and BaP treatment led to an approximately 15% decrease in its steady-state concentration (P ¼
0.005), whereas C16:0, C16:1, and C18:0 levels were unchanged
(Fig. 2B). To determine the effects of BaP treatment on fatty acid

and phospholipid biosynthesis from glucose, HL60 cells were
grown in the presence of 13C D-glucose for 24 hours with and
without BaP, and 13C incorporation into lipids was measured by
[]DIMS. BaP treatment decreased the incorporation of labeled
carbon from 13C D-glucose into some free fatty acids (C16:1 0.66fold, P ¼ 0.008; C18:0 0.68-fold, P < 0.001; C18:1 0.25-fold, P <
0.001) and phosphatidylcholine (0.71-fold; P ¼ 0.001), phosphatidylethanolamine (0.6-fold; P < 0.001), and phosphatidylinositol (0.59-fold; P ¼ 0.025) phospholipids but did not signiﬁcantly
alter 13C D-glucose incorporation into C16:0 fatty acid (P ¼ 0.63)
or phosphatidylserine (P ¼ 0.22). Bezaﬁbrate was the major
contributor to the effects of BaP; however, given that the changes
associated with BaP were more substantial and/or more signiﬁcant
than bezaﬁbrate treatment alone, MPA also appears to play a role
(Fig. 2C and D and Supplementary Table S7).
The absolute intensities of each newly synthesized 13C phosphatidylcholine (PC) species from 13C D-glucose in HL60 cells are
shown in Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S3A.
The ﬁve most highly produced species [PC(32:1), PC(34:1), PC
(34:2), PC(36:1), and PC(36:2): accounting for >80% of all
synthesized phosphatidylcholine] contained at least one monounsaturated fatty acyl chain and C18:1 was present in all but
one of the species (Supplementary Table S8). The incorporation
of 13C from 13C D-glucose into these ﬁve phosphatidylcholine
species was signiﬁcantly decreased after BaP treatment (0.65- to
0.73-fold decrease; P < 0.01; Supplementary Table S8), which is
consistent with the observed BaP-induced decrease in de novo
C18:1 synthesis, as described above. Phosphatidylcholine species
that had not been newly synthesized from 13C D-glucose (12C
isotope peaks; Supplementary Fig. S3B) were generally increased
after BaP treatment, particularly the long-chain polyunsaturated
species, suggesting that cells were obtaining these from sources
other than glucose, including exogenous import. Phosphatidylcholine species distribution heatmaps for each of the 12C and 13C
datasets (Supplementary Fig. S4) showed that BaP decreased the
de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine species with 0 to 2
double bonds and increased the abundance of polyunsaturated
species mainly via a non-glucose, and most likely exogenous
source. This is consistent with the earlier ﬁndings and gives a
rationale for the observed pattern seen in Fig. 1E.
BaP treatment modiﬁes the expression of key enzymes involved
in lipogenesis
The decreases in fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis led us to
ask whether 24-hour BaP treatment was altering expression levels
of the enzymes responsible for fatty acid synthesis and desaturation. These were investigated in the two AML cell lines (HL60 and
K562) plus two Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (BL31 and Glor).

Synthesis of malonyl-CoA by ACC1 is the ﬁrst committed
step in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. There were decreases in
ACC1 mRNA (HL60: 0.73-fold, P ¼ 0.016; BL31: 0.78-fold, P ¼
0.008; Glor: 0.8-fold, P ¼ 0.029) following 24-hour BaP treatment in HL60, BL31, and Glor cells, but not in K562 cells
(Fig. 3A), whereas ACC1 protein levels remained relatively
unchanged across the four cell lines (Fig. 3B). ACC1 can be
posttranslationally inhibited by phosphorylation at serine 79
(denoted pACC). Immunoassay of pACC showed increased
ACC1 phosphorylation in K562 cells (2.8-fold; P ¼ 0.0001),
but no change in the other three cell lines (Fig. 3B). FASN
catalyzes the synthesis of palmitate (C16:0) from acetyl-CoA
and malonyl-CoA. BaP treatment decreased mRNA expression
of FASN in three of the four cell lines (HL60: 0.41-fold, P <
0.001; BL31: 0.62-fold, P ¼ 0.006; Glor: 0.67-fold, P ¼ 0.036),
but not in K562 cells (Fig. 3C), and FASN protein levels were
decreased in BaP-treated cells across all cell lines (0.87-fold, P ¼
0.009; Fig. 3D).
The clearest effects of BaP treatment were on SCD1, which
mainly converts stearate (C18:0) to oleate (C18:1) and is the ratelimiting step in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids.
SCD1 mRNA levels were decreased in HL60, BL31, and Glor cells
(HL60: 0.63-fold, P ¼ 0.005; BL31: 0.8-fold, P ¼ 0.007; Glor:
0.83-fold, P ¼ 0.042), though not in K562 cells (Fig. 4A).
However, BaP treatment caused a signiﬁcant decrease in
SCD1 protein concentration in all four cell lines (HL60: 0.6-fold,

P ¼ 0.016; K562: 0.62-fold, P ¼ 0.017; BL31: 0.52-fold, P ¼ 0.023;
Glor: 0.46-fold, P < 0.001; Fig. 4B), with both bezaﬁbrate and
MPA both contributing to this effect.
BaP-treated cells can be rescued by oleate (C18:1) but not
palmitate (C16:0)
The BaP-induced depletion of C18:1 free fatty acid levels and
decrease in SCD1 concentration led us to consider whether
provision of exogenous oleate (C18:1) might rescue the leukemia and lymphoma cell lines from killing by BaP during 96-hour
culture. Supplementation with oleate, which was added as a
complex with BSA, increased the viable cell count of BaP-treated
cells in a dose-dependent manner in all four cell lines (between
1.4- and 2.1-fold increase with 300-mmol/L oleate compared
with no oleate supplementation; P < 1  106; Fig. 5A). Analysis
of the effect on bezaﬁbrate and MPA as single treatments showed
that 300-mmol/L oleate rescued bezaﬁbrate-treated cells almost
back to untreated control levels in all four cell lines, whereas
there was only a small rescue effect in MPA-treated K562 and
BL31 cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, supplementation of BaP-treated
cells with palmitate–BSA complex (C16:0), the product of
FASN, did not rescue the cells from the effects of BaP, and
concentrations of palmitate above 100-mmol/L reduced viable
cell counts in both BaP-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 5C).
Our earlier observations demonstrated that AML cell killing by
BaP requires a >96-hour exposure (9), whereas killing of eBL cells
is more rapid (7). Consistent with this, oleate induced a strong
antiapoptotic effect in the Burkitt cell lines, as measured by
decreased Annexin V staining, which was not observed in AML
cells (Fig. 5D).
A commercial SCD1 inhibitor can partially recapitulate the
effect of BaP on lipogenesis.
As SCD1 appeared to be a target of BaP, we treated cells
with a commercial SCD1 inhibitor (4-(2-Chlorophenoxy)-N[3-[(methylamino)carconyl]phenyl]-1-piperidinecarboxamide
[ab142089]) in the presence of 13C-D-glucose to identify if it
could generate a similar lipid proﬁle to that seen in BaP-treated
cells. With respect to fatty acid synthesis from 13C D-glucose,
ab142089 decreased C18:1 (0.70-fold; P ¼ 6  104) and
C16:1 (0.83-fold; P ¼ 0.005) production, increased C18:0
production (1.2-fold, P ¼ 0.03) and had little effect on
C16:0 production (P ¼ 0.13; Supplementary Fig. S5A). The
levels of synthesis of C16:0, C16:1, and C18:1 after ab142089
treatment were consistent with those observed after BaP treatment (Fig. 2C); however, the effect on C18:0 synthesis was
inconsistent: this was decreased by BaP treatment and increased
by ab142089 treatment (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S5A).
When looking at individual classes of fatty acid, ab142089
decreased synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids from
13
C D-glucose (0.73-fold; P ¼ 4  104), but did not signiﬁcantly alter saturated fatty acid synthesis (P ¼ 0.07; Supplementary Fig. S5B). Considering phosphatidylcholine synthesis
from 13C D-glucose, ab142089 decreased production of PC
(36:2) (0.77-fold; P ¼ 0.005) and increased production of
PC(36:1) (1.37-fold; P ¼ 0.008; Supplementary Fig. S6A),
whereas BaP decreased the synthesis of many phosphatidylcholine species, including PC(36:1) and PC(36:2) (Supplementary Fig. S3A). These ﬁndings suggest that BaP decreases SCD1
activity but also negatively regulates other lipogenic processes,
including FASN (see above).

2536 Cancer Res; 75(12) June 15, 2015

Oleate decreases the levels of BaP-induced ROS
BaP induces ROS in all cell types that are sensitive to this drug
combination (8–10). We therefore tested whether the rescue of
cells mediated by oleate was associated with diminished ROS
production. As shown in Fig. 6, oleate (300 mmol/L) decreased
ROS levels in both AML and eBL control cells (between 0.51- and
0.83-fold) and in BaP-treated cells (between 0.57- and 0.82fold; Fig. 6). In BaP-treated K562, BL31, and Glor cells, oleate
treatment brought ROS down to levels similar to those found in
the untreated control cells. Given that ROS production is indicated as a major reason for the killing action of BaP, the ROS
decrease is noteworthy and suggests that oleate is cytoprotective to
BaP-treated cells by lowering ROS to tolerable levels. The rescue of
AML and Burkitt lymphoma cells by oleate was associated with
the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets in both BaPtreated and untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). These are
likely to represent the safe storage of fatty acids as TAG (25, 26).

Discussion
There is a need for new low-toxicity therapies that selectively
target cancer cells. Enhanced lipogenesis, arising from increased
activities of fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes (including ACC1,
FASN, and stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD1)—see the pathways
map in Fig. 7), is a metabolic hallmark of many cancer cells (15–
17). Inhibition of these enzymes has been demonstrated to be
selectively toxic to some cancer cells in vitro (18, 20–24), suggesting that this pathway might represent a good target for anticancer
drugs. In particular, cancer cells appear to have a high dependence
on monounsaturated fatty acids (39), which are key components
of phospholipids. Monounsaturated fatty acids can also protect
cells against saturated fatty acid toxicity by enhancing safe storage
of saturates into TAGs (25, 26). In cancer cells, SCD1 inhibition
leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis (40), symptoms that are similar to palmitate-induced lipotoxicity (41), and
in cardiac myocytes, SCD1 activity protects cells against fatty acid–
induced apoptosis (42). Given their rapid saturated fatty acid
synthesis by ACC1 and FASN (15), cancer cells may be heavily
reliant on SCD1 activity, making SCD1 a potential target for
anticancer therapy. However, there are currently no routine therapies targeting SCD1 in the clinic.
Here, we describe an investigation, at the lipid, gene, and
protein levels, of the effects of the antileukemia and antilymphoma therapy BaP (combined 0.5-mmol/L bezaﬁbrate and 5mmol/L MPA) on lipogenesis in AML and eBL cells. Our clearest
observations on the effects of BaP treatment on lipogenesis in these
two disease settings are the following: (i) phospholipid species
with saturated and monounsaturated acyl chains were decreased,
whereas phospholipids with polyunsaturated chains were increased, (ii) BaP treatment decreased the incorporation of 13C
from 13C D-glucose into a variety of cellular lipids, especially into
monounsaturated free fatty acids and phospholipids with monounsaturated acyl chains, (iii) BaP caused a decrease in the concentration, and probably the activity, of SCD1, and (iv) supplementation of BaP-treated cells with oleate (the product of SCD1
activity), but not with palmitate, protected AML and eBL cells from
killing by BaP. Both bezaﬁbrate and MPA appear to have antilipogenic action individually but the effect against AML and eBL cell
lines was enhanced when the two drugs were combined.
At ﬁrst sight, two of these observations appear contradictory:
the rate of introduction of new double bonds into fatty acids

de novo synthesized PCs in cells used in this study, and the
synthesis of these species from 13C D-glucose was strongly
decreased by BaP. Conversely, phosphatidylcholine species that
were not synthesized de novo from 13C D-glucose increased after
BaP treatment, especially those with polyunsaturated acyl
chains, which suggested that the cells were taking up exogenous
lipids to compensate for the reduction in de novo synthesis. This
phenomenon has been observed in prostate cancer cells after
ACC1 inhibition that led to a doubling of the quantity of
essential polyunsaturated fatty acids being incorporated into
phospholipids (44). The increase in unsaturation of phospholipids in ACC1-inhibited prostate cancer cells caused them to
become more sensitive to ROS-induced lipid peroxidation and
apoptosis and this could be a useful therapeutic consequence of
the treatment (44). Therefore, our observation of the change to
phospholipid saturation status could be particularly relevant in
the case of BaP, which is a strong inducer of intracellular ROS
and also lipid peroxidation (9).
The changes to phospholipid synthesis and acyl chain composition can be explained by lowered fatty acid biosynthesis due to a
BaP-induced decrease in FASN and SCD1 protein levels. SCD1
disruption appeared to be the more dominant factor as its protein
levels were more strongly decreased in all four cell lines compared
with FASN. Also the synthesis of the SCD1 products (C18:1 and
C16:1 fatty acids) from 13C D-glucose was strongly decreased by
BaP, whereas the synthesis of the FASN product (16:0 fatty acid)
was unchanged, which was consistent with the actions of a
commercial SCD1 inhibitor (ab142089). BaP had a broader
negative effect on lipid synthesis than ab142089, including more
widespread decrease in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine
species, which can be explained to some extent by the BaPinduced decreases of FASN protein levels and FASN and ACC1
gene expression. However, the critical anticancer component of

2538 Cancer Res; 75(12) June 15, 2015

BaP appeared to be the decrease in SCD1 protein levels because
oleate (C18:1, SCD1 product), but not palmitate (C16:0, ACC1
and FASN product), supplementation could rescue both AML and
eBL cells from BaP treatment.
Monounsaturated fatty acids have been shown to be important in cancer (39, 45), which, in part, is due to their requirement for cellular growth and proliferation. SCD1 is suggested

Antilipogenic Leukemia Therapy Targets SCD1

be a major driver of fatty acid synthesis from glucose (46) and
has also been shown to help negotiate cellular stress, with
SCD1 inhibition leading to saturated fatty acid accumulation,
toxicity, and endoplasmic reticulum stress (40, 47, 48). This is
likely to be of particular importance in the cancer phenotype
where levels of saturated fatty acid synthesis are often high
(15, 16). BaP treatment led to increases in ROS and TAG levels,
which are consistent with elevated saturated fatty acid levels
as ROS is a symptom of endoplasmic reticulum stress and
saturated fatty acid lipotoxicity (49, 50), whereas TAG represent
a safe storage of excess saturated fatty acids in the cell (25, 26).
In support of the BaP-induced ROS being related to saturated
fatty acid build-up, supplementation of BaP-treated cells with
oleate, which can rescue cells from palmitate toxicity (25),
decreased ROS levels. This was accompanied with an increase
in cytoplasmic lipid droplets, a similar phenomenon to that
seen during oleate rescue of cells from saturated fatty acid–
induced lipotoxicity (25).
To conclude, we show that the redeployed drug combination of
bezaﬁbrate and MPA kills AML and eBL cells, in part, by decreasing
SCD1 protein levels and slowing monounsaturated fatty acid
synthesis. This study is relevant to the wider context of cancer
therapeutics where signiﬁcant effort is being invested into developing therapeutics that can disrupt fatty acid biosynthesis by
interfering with SCD1 due to its apparent anticancer activity
(21–23). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to describe
clinically available drugs with demonstrable antileukemic and
antilymphoma activity in clinical trials (11, 12) that target this
pathway.
