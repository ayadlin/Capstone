BACKGROUND. Early catheter-related infection is a serious complication in cancer
treatment, although risk factors for its occurrence are not well established. The
authors conducted a prospective study to identify the risk factors for developing
early catheter-related infection.

METHODS. All consecutive patients with cancer who underwent insertion of a
central venous catheter were enrolled and were followed prospectively during 1
month. The study endpoint was occurrence of early catheter-related infection.

Department of General Oncology, Oscar Lambret Cancer Center, Lille, France.

RESULTS. Over 10,392 catheter-days of follow-up, 14 of 371 patients had early

2

catheter-days). The causative pathogens were gram positive in 11 of 14 patients.

catheter-related infections (14 patients in 10,392 catheter-days or 1.34 per 1000
In univariate analysis, the risk factors for early catheter-related infection were
aged <10 years (P 5 .0001), difficulties during insertion (P < 1026), blood product
administration (P < 1023), parenteral nutrition (P < 1024), and use >2 days
(P < 1026). In multivariate analysis, 3 variables remained significantly associated
with the risk of early catheter-related infection: age <10 years (odds ratio [OR],
18.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.9–106.7), difficulties during insertion
procedure (OR, 25.6; 95% CI, 4.2–106), and parenteral nutrition (OR, 28.5; 95%
CI, 4.2–200).

CONCLUSIONS. On the day of insertion, 2 variables were identified that were associated with a high risk of developing an early catheter-related infection: young
age and difficulties during insertion. The results from this study may be used to
identify patients who are at high risk of infection who may be candidates for preventive strategies. Cancer 2007;110:1586–92.  2007 American Cancer Society.

espite the development of oral anticancer drugs, the vast majority of patients with cancer who are considered for medical
treatment require a venous-access device (a subcutaneously
implanted device or an externalized catheter).1–9 It has been estimated that approximately 67% of patients who are hospitalized in
comprehensive cancer centers have venous-access catheters.3 The 2
main complications related to central venous access are thrombosis
and infections.3–5
Catheter-related infections represent the most frequent nosocomial infections in cancer patients.2–6 Approximately 33% of patients
experience an episode of infection while they have a catheter in
place.7 In recent studies, the reported catheter-related infection rate
in adults with cancers was 2 per 1000 catheter-days,7–9 and the
incidence of infection was greater in children with cancer.4 Those
nosocomial infections prolong hospital stay from 7 to 21 days and
account for an estimated increase in hospital costs of $3000 to

$40,000 per patient.10–13 Causative pathogens usually
are gram-positive pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus
and noncoagulase-positive Staphylococcus), other
skin saprophytic microorganisms (Corynebacterium
sp., Bacillus sp., and Propionibacterium sp.), and
Candida sp.11–13 Gram-negative rods reportedly are
less frequent.14–16
The main risk factors for long-term catheterrelated infections are the duration of catheter use and,
consequently, the multiple manipulations.4,5,14–21
However, infections also may appear early after
catheter insertion and most likely are related to
insertion procedures.1–3,7 Preventive strategies, such
as antibiotic flushing, antibioprophylaxis, and antibiotic-coated catheters, should be investigated to
reduce the incidence of early catheter-related infections. However, first, the patients who are at high
risk of developing early central venous catheterrelated infection and who can benefit from these
preventive strategies should be identified.7,9,22
Patients who are at high risk for catheter-related
infection and, more specifically, for early infections
are not well identified. The objective of this study
was to identify the risk factors for early catheterrelated infection in cancer patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Procedures
We performed a 5-month, observational, prospective
study that focused on the incidence and risk factors
for early catheter-related infection in 371 consecutive
patients with solid cancers at the Oscar Lambret
Hospital in Northern France who underwent catheter
insertions between July and November 2005. Catheter insertions were performed in the operating room
following the general rules of sterility. The physician
wore a mask, cap, sterile gloves, and surgical gowns
and used large, sterile drapes. Patients had an antiseptic shower and, if necessary, depilation. Showers
were given systematically 1 hour before catheter
insertion. Patients received information regarding the
shower from a nurse. The antiseptic used was povidone-iodine. Chlorexhidine was used for patients
who were allergic to povidone-iodine. The quality of
the shower was checked by the nurse.
All wounds were prepared with povidone-iodine.
No antibiotic prophylaxis was administered. The vast
majority of patients received treatment on an outpatient basis. Insertion was performed according to
international recommendations.1,21,23 Two types of
central access devices were used: a subcutaneously
implanted device, which was inserted by surgeons
(Polysite for adults and Babyport for children aged

1587

<2 years; port housing constructed with titanium),
and an externalized catheter (polyurethane Blue Flex
Tip), which was inserted by anesthetists. Venous
access was through the jugular vein and the cephalic
vein for totally implantable, venous-access catheters
and through the subclavian vein for external, indwelling, central venous-access catheters. All of
catheters were tunnelized.

Data Collection
For each catheter insertion we recorded 1) patient
characteristics (sex, age, and Karnofsky index), disease characteristics (location of primary cancer, presence and type of metastases), and catheter
characteristics (subcutaneously implanted device vs
externalized catheter) at baseline (ie, on the day of
catheter insertion) and 2) variables associated with
the treatments administered during the month after
catheter insertion (ie, chemotherapy, blood products,
or parenteral nutrition) and the number of utilization
days. All data were collected prospectively.
In addition, we noted whether ‘‘difficulties during insertion procedures’’ had occurred. These difficulties were defined as insertion procedures that
required multiple punctures (2) and/or modification of the initial insertion site and/or procedures
that were associated with bleeding (including hematoma) or technical errors (ie, inadequate povidoneiodine exposure time before the procedure or contact
of inserted material with nonaseptic elements).
Diagnosis of Early Catheter-related Infection
All catheters were evaluated during the month after
insertion at each admission (day hospital or conventional hospitalization). External, indwelling, central
venous-access catheter-related infections were defined as follows6,23: 1) isolation of the same organism
from percutaneous blood culture and from one of
the following: exudate at the catheter exit site, or a
semiquantitative catheter-segment culture (the roll
plate technique, although this required catheter removal16), or blood obtained through the catheter
with a quantitative blood culture that showed a 5
times higher colony count from the blood obtained
through the catheter than from a percutaneous blood
culture; and 2) temporal succession of catheter flushing, onset of chills and fever, and a positive blood
culture (highly suggestive of a catheter-related infection).
With regard to the totally implantable, venousaccess catheters, the diagnosis of a catheter-related
infection was made as follows: 1) isolation of the
same organism from percutaneous blood culture and
quantitative blood culture with recovery of a 5-fold

1588

higher colony count from the blood obtained
through the catheter compared with the colony
count from a percutaneous blood culture; and 2) a
temporal succession of catheter flushing, onset of
chills and fever, and a positive blood culture. In all
patients, the diagnosis of catheter-related infection
was confirmed by culture of the device after removal.
An ‘‘early’’ catheter-related infection was defined as a
catheter-related infection that was diagnosed during
the 30 days after the insertion.

Statistical Analysis
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Fisher exact test
were used to compare the general characteristics of
patients with and without infections. The crude
infection-exposure association was determined by
estimating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
interval (95% CI).24 If the number of observed events
was equal to 0 when evaluating the association
between infection and a characteristic (ie, general
anesthesia), we used the data-manipulation technique for OR calculation; that is, we added 1 to all
cells in a 2 3 table.25
Exposures for which the P value was <.20 in the
univariate analysis were submitted to a multivariate
conditional logistic regression model. Backward stepwise regression procedures were used to develop the
final multivariate model, and possible interactions
were examined.26 A P value <.05 (2-tailed) was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software, version 14.
Ethical Review
Patients and the parents of children who were enrolled were informed about the conduct of this study,
and their consent was obtained. In addition, this
study was approved by the French Commission
Nationale Informatique et Libertes (date of approval,
June 2005).

indwelling, central venous-access catheters in 72
patients (20%). The surgical procedure rarely was
performed under general anesthesia (21 patients;
5.6%). The median insertion procedure length was 42
minutes (range, 5–420 minutes). We observed difficulties during insertion, as defined above, in 25
patients (6.7%). The median duration of catheter use
was 2 days (range, 0–30 days).

Early Catheter-related Infection Incidence
We observed 14 early catheter-related infections during the study period (14 of 371 patients; 3.7%; 95%
CI, 1.8%–5.7%). The overall follow-up ranged
between 2 days and 35 days (median, 30 days) for a
total of 10,392 catheter-days. The median time
between catheter insertion and a diagnosis of infection was 11.5 days (range, 3–25 days). The incidence
of early catheter-related infections was 14 in 10,392
catheter-days (1.34 per 1000 catheter-days). The
causative pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis
(5 patients), meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (4 patients), Escherichia coli (2 patients), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1 patient), Staphylococcus
hominus (1 patient), and Candida albicans (1
patient). The treatment of infection required the removal of catheters in all patients.
Risk Factors: Univariate Analysis
In the univariate analysis (Table 1), at baseline (the
day of catheter insertion), we identified 2 factors that
were predictive of catheter-related infection: age <10
years (OR, 17.86; 95% CI, 4.33–73.57; P < 1023) and
difficulties during the insertion procedure (OR, 18.83;
95% CI, 5.96–59.5; P < 1026). In addition, there was a
trend toward a correlation between the duration of
insertion procedure and the risk of infection
(P 5 .06). Moreover, during the period after catheter
insertion, the following variables were associated
with increasing risk of infection: duration of use >2
days (P < 1025), parenteral nutrition (P < 1024), and
blood product administration (P < 1023).

RESULTS
Population and Insertion Procedures
The cohort consisted of 133 men and 238 women.
The median age was 53 years (range, 2–86 years).
The median Karnofsky index was 70% (range, 40%–
90%). All patients presented with solid cancers. The
main primary malignancies were breast cancers (147
patients; 39%), gastrointestinal cancers (50 patients;
13%), gynecologic cancers (41 patients; 11%), head
and neck cancers (10%) and lung cancers (5%). One
hundred twenty-two patients had metastases (32%).
The catheters were totally implantable, venousaccess catheters in 299 patients (80%) and external,

Risk Factors: Multivariate Analysis
In the multivariate analysis (Table 2), 3 risk factors
were identified that were associated with the risk of
infection: age <10 years (P 5 .009; adjusted OR, 18.4;
95% CI, 2.8–86.7), difficulties during the insertion
procedure (P 5 .001; OR, 25.6; 95% CI, 4.2–106), and
parenteral nutrition (P 5 .001; OR, 28.5; 95% CI, 4.2–
200). The decision tree shown in Figure 1 illustrates
the incidence of infection according to the risk factors observed at baseline (the day of catheter insertion): age <10 years and difficulties during catheter
insertion.

DISCUSSION
In this observational cohort of patients with cancer,
the incidence of early catheter-related infections was
estimated at 1.34 per 1000 catheter-days. We identified 2 categories of risk factors for early catheterrelated infections: risk factors on the day of catheter
insertion (patient age <10 years and difficulties dur-

ing the insertion procedure) and risk factors during
catheter use (duration of use, blood product administration, and parenteral nutrition).
In recent large studies, most of which were conducted among adults, the reported incidence of
catheter-related infection ranged from 1.4 to 2.2
infections per 1000 catheter-days.7–9,14 However, cau-

tion must be used when comparing our estimates
with the incidence reported in those studies, because
most studies evaluated the incidence of catheterrelated infections overall and not the incidence of
early catheter-related infections. However, our findings are close to the lower bound of estimates
reported in those studies (observed incidence, 1.34

infections per 1000 catheter-days). Optimal conditions
for catheter insertion clearly have been established:
antiseptic shower, depilation, wound preparation with
chlorexhidine or other antiseptic, and a surgical procedure for insertion.22,27 Manipulation of central venous access also requires a strict asepsis.22,27
We observed that the variables duration of
catheter use, parenteral nutrition, and blood product administration were associated with early catheter-related infections. Those risk factors are well
known in data from the literature and have been
associated with late catheter-related infections,2,23,28
most likely related to increasing catheter manipulation and consequent catheter contamination. In our
study, to identify the risk factors that were associated with infection at baseline, we took into consideration and adjusted the analysis on those wellknown risk factors in a multivariate logistic regression model.2,23,28 We also observed a trend toward a
greater frequency of early catheter-related infections
in patients who had subcutaneously implanted
devices compared with patients who had externalized catheters, although the difference was not
statistically significant. The impact of the characteristics of the catheter on the occurrence of infection
has become a topic of controversy in the medical
literature.20,21,29

Early Catheter-related Infection Risk/Penel et al.

At baseline, first, we observed that age <10 years
was associated with a higher rate of early catheterrelated infections. In another study, it was observed
that young age (<6 years) was associated independently with catheter-related complications, including
infections.4 Other investigators demonstrated the
high incidence of catheter-related complications in
the pediatric population,4,29 possibly because of the
chemotherapy regimens that are used in pediatric
populations, which usually are more complex and
include high-dose-intensity maintenance. In addition, it is more difficult for children to stay immobile
during catheter insertion or catheter manipulation.
Consequently, the risk of contamination may
increase with each procedure.
Second, we observed that catheter insertion difficulties were associated with early catheter-related
infections. This was obvious and was related to the
finding that, because of those difficulties, the risk of
technical errors increased.
There were several limitations to the current
study. First, this was a single-center study that was
conducted in a comprehensive cancer center. Our
results may not be applicable directly to other areas
in France or abroad or in other settings. For example,
none of our patients had hematologic malignancies.
The policy of nosocomial prevention can differ significantly in different hospitals. For example, recent
recommendations favor chlorexhidine rather than
the povidone-iodine that was used in the current
study. In addition, in this study, we did not evaluate
the impact of some variables, such as duration of
neutropenia after catheter insertion, on the occurrence of infection; however, neutropenia that occurs
for >7 days is rare in patients with solid
tumours.14,19 Moreover, the diagnosis of infection for
a subcutaneously implanted device is not well established. We used a definition derived from the established definition for catheter-related infection.
However, in all patients, the diagnosis of infection
from a totally implanted catheter was confirmed by
culture of material after removal of the device.
Early catheter-related infections are caused
mostly by organisms from the skin insertion site.
Thereafter, the catheter hub becomes a far more important source of infection.22 Different preventive
strategies, such as antimicrobial-impregnated central
venous catheters, antibiotic flushing in catheters,
and antibioprophylaxis, need to be evaluated to
reduce the incidence of catheter-related infection in
cancer patients.7–9,22,30 In the current study, we identified those patients who are at risk for early catheter-related infection among cancer patients who may
benefit from these strategies.
