Abstract
Pemetrexed represents the first antifolate cancer drug to be
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 20 years;
it is currently in widespread use for first line therapy of
mesothelioma and non–small cell lung cancer. Pemetrexed
has more than one site of action; the primary site is thymidylate synthase. We now report that the secondary target
is the downstream folate-dependent enzyme in de novo purine
synthesis, aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICART). The substrate of the AICART reaction,
ZMP, accumulated in intact pemetrexed-inhibited tumor cells,
identifying AICART as the step in purine synthesis that becomes
rate-limiting after drug treatment. The accumulating ZMP
causes an activation of AMP-activated protein kinase with
subsequent inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) and hypophosphorylation of the downstream targets
of mTOR that control initiation of protein synthesis and cell
growth. We suggest that the activity of pemetrexed against
human cancers is a reflection of its direct inhibition of folatedependent target proteins combined with prolonged inhibition of the mTOR pathway secondary to accumulation of ZMP.
[Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5467–74]

In a series of cell culture experiments, we have developed
evidence that the target for pemetrexed secondary to thymidylate
synthase is the second folate-dependent enzyme in purine
synthesis, aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICART), not GART, the target for lometrexol (6RDDATHF). The significance of this is substantial, because the
substrate for GART is very labile and is probably inert due to this
lability. In contrast, the substrate for AICART is ZMP, a known
activator of the AMP-activated protein kinase, AMPK (7), a key
controlling element in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway (8).
A therapeutic approach built around reactivation of control on
a pathway often dormant in tumor cells due to loss of tumor
suppressor gene product function or constitutive activation of concogenes would be very attractive. The accumulation of ZMP
offers such an approach, due to the placement of AMPK in the
mTOR pathway. Such accumulation of a regulatory intermediate
behind a metabolic block had been predicted to be a theoretical
avenue for therapeutic drug design, but this case represents a
rare instance in which this theory has been reduced to practice.
Hence, pemetrexed is indeed a multitargeted inhibitor whose activity
seems to extend beyond the traditional targets of antifolates.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
The antifolate pemetrexed is a potent inhibitor of thymidylate
synthase and a very efficient substrate for human folylpolyglutamate synthetase, creating anabolites that are retained intracellularly after drug exposure (1–4). However, pemetrexed also has at
least one other target that becomes apparent from a continued
antiproliferative effect in cell cultures exposed to exogenous
thymidine, which prevents the cytotoxic effects of thymidylate
synthase inhibition (1, 2). A study of the activity of pemetrexed
against several recombinant mouse and human enzymes in vitro
led to the conclusion that both glycinamide ribonucleotide
transformylase (GART) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) were
potential secondary targets for the polyglutamate forms of
pemetrexed (2). The secondary target for pemetrexed is generally
taken as GART (5), which was suggested, but not proven, by the
in vitro enzyme kinetic data (2). The question of the identity of
any secondary targets for pemetrexed has become of substantial
interest given the clinical responses to the drug in lung cancers (6),
an unusual activity for folate antimetabolites.

Cell culture maintenance and reagents. CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemia cells were maintained at a density between 105 and
106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine
serum. Reversal experiments were performed in media supplemented with
20 mmol/L HEPES and 40 mmol/L MOPS. Pemetrexed and (6R)-DDATHF
were obtained from Eli Lilly and Co. and were dissolved in PBS. All other
culture reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich and were of the highest available
quality. 6-[4-(2-Piperidin-1-yl)-phenyl]-3-pyridin-4-yl-pyrrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine (compound C) was also obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Stock
concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. In studies using
modifying agents, 5.6 Amol/L of thymidine, 32 Amol/L hypoxanthine, and
320 Amol/L aminoimidazolecarboxamide (AICA) were used, unless otherwise noted. Cell counts were obtained using a Beckman Coulter Counter.
When CEM cells were treated for longer than 48 h, fresh drug-containing
media was applied at 48 h.
N-Formyl glycinamide ribonucleotide synthesis from 14C-glycine.
Exponentially growing CEM cells were harvested and resuspended in RPMI
1640 without glutamine or serum, and azaserine was added to 10 Amol/L
for 30 min at 37jC. Glutamine at 2 Amol/L and 0.25 ACi/mL of 14C-glycine
were added, and incubation was continued at 37jC for 1 h. Nucleotides
were extracted and radioactivity in the N-Formyl glycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) peak was measured by chromatography on AG1 resin as
previously described (9).
High performance liquid chromatography analysis of ZMP. Following drug exposure, culture densities were determined electronically. Cell

diethyl ether. Samples were passed through a 0.45 Am syringe filter before
being injected onto a Phenosphere SAX 250  2.0 mm high performance
liquid chromatography column (Phenomenex). Absorbance was monitored
at 280 nm using a linear gradient of 5 mmol/L NH4H2PO4 (pH 2.8) to
750 mmol/L NH 4 H 2 PO 4 (pH 3.9) over 25 min at a flow rate
of 0.2 mL/min. ZMP concentration was determined by fitting peak
absorbance to a standard curve generated from synthetic ZMP. The
detection limit of this assay was 25 pmol.
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed in buffer containing
62.5 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.5), 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol,
50 mmol/L NaF, 0.2 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 1 protease inhibitor complete
mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined
using Bradford assay, against a standard of bovine serum albumin (BSA).
Total cellular protein (40 Ag) was resolved on 7.5%, 4% to 15%, and 15%
SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were transferred to an Immobilon-P
polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked
with either 5% milk or Starting Block Buffer (Pierce), washed, and probed
with antibodies against AMPKa (1:1000), phospho-AMPKa (T172; 1:250),
4EBP1 (1:1,000), phospho-4EBP1 (T70; 1:1,000), S6 kinase (1:1,000), phosphoS6 kinase (T389; 1:500), acetyl CoA carboxylase (1:1,000), Raptor and
phosphoRaptor (S792; 1:1,000), and phosphoacetyl-CoA carboxylase (S79;
1:1,000) at 4jC overnight. All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling.
Total and phospho-S6 Kinase, 4EBP1, and total and phosphoRaptor
antibodies were diluted in Starting Block Buffer (Pierce), all other
antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA in TBST. Membranes were incubated
with anti-rabbit secondary antibody with horseradish peroxidase conjugate
for 1 h at room temperature (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was detected
using the SuperSignal West Pico and West Dura Chemiluminescent
Substrate kits (Pierce).

Results
Reversal of the growth inhibition of pemetrexed by purines
and thymidine. The growth of human CEM leukemia cells is
inhibited by pemetrexed at tens of nanomolar concentrations. This
growth inhibition is not reversed by preformed purines, such as
hypoxanthine, but inclusion of thymidine in the culture medium
does reverse the growth inhibitory effects of pemetrexed, shifting
the concentrations of drug needed to affect growth by about 12fold, as shown for the CEM human leukemia cell line in Fig. 1A.
Inclusion of both thymidine and hypoxanthine reverses the effects
of pemetrexed at even high concentrations (Fig. 1A), in agreement
with previous literature (1, 2). These observations have previously
been interpreted to mean that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate
synthase as its primary target, and has a second site of action
within the folate pathways, presumably on purine synthesis, that is
only affected at higher drug concentrations (1, 2). To determine
whether the first or second folate dependent enzyme of de novo
purine synthesis, GART or AICART, respectively (Fig. 1C), is
affected by drug, we tested the effects of AICA on the inhibition
of growth of CEM cells by pemetrexed. AICA is metabolized to the
corresponding ribonucleotide, AICAR monophosphate (also known
as ZMP) by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, and thus, inclusion
of AICA in growth medium introduces a purine pathway intermediate into the cell that is downstream of GART but upstream
of AICART (Fig. 1C). If the secondary target of pemetrexed were
GART, inclusion of thymidine and AICA in the medium should
completely reverse growth inhibition (9, 10), whereas if AICART
were inhibited, either no effect or a mild exacerbation of growth
inhibition would be expected. Others have shown that AICA by
itself at 300 Amol/L did not change the potency of pemetrexed
against CEM cells (2). However, AICA (320 Amol/L) mildly enhanced the growth inhibition by pemetrexed in the presence of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

thymidine (Fig. 1A). In contrast, AICA shifted the sensitivity of
CEM cells to the GART inhibitor 6R-DDATHF (Fig. 1B), similarly to
that seen in mouse cells (9, 10). We concluded that the secondary
target of pemetrexed was not GART, and was most likely AICART.
Effects of pemetrexed on GART and AICART in intact cells.
In the original determination of the site of action of lometrexol
within the purine pathway in mouse cells (9), we had used the facts
that the enzyme downstream of GART was sensitive to the glutamine analogue azaserine, and the enzyme immediately preceding
GART in this pathway incorporated glycine into the purine skeleton
(Fig. 1C). We previously used these metabolic aspects to show that
DDATHF inhibited the accumulation of 14C-glycine into FGAR in
azaserine-treated mouse leukemic cells and, hence, had GART as a
primary target (9). This is also the case in intact CEM cells for 6RDDATHF (Fig. 2A) over the concentration range that is growth
inhibitory (Fig. 1B). In contrast, pemetrexed gradually inhibited
14
C-FGAR accumulation (Fig. 2A) to a lower extent that did not
reach 50% over the range of concentrations associated with drug
action. Hence, any effect of pemetrexed directly or indirectly on
GART in intact cells seems to be limited. When the metabolic fate
of the intermediates of this pathway were followed further downstream, it was found that the ZMP pool expanded in pemetrexedtreated cells, indicating an effect of pemetrexed or its metabolites
predominantly on AICART (Fig. 2B). If inhibition of GART played a
role in the secondary effects of pemetrexed, ZMP accumulation
would not have been observed (Fig. 1C). To this point, ZMP accumulation did not occur in 6R-DDATHF–treated CEM cells (Fig. 2B).
When CEM cells were treated with AICA in the presence of
pemetrexed, the accumulation of ZMP was exacerbated, implying
that blockage of de novo purine synthesis at the AICART step was
restricting the flow of intermediates through this pathway (Fig. 1C
and see below). The accumulation of ZMP was progressive after
drug treatment (Fig. 2C), occurred over the range of concentrations
at which pemetrexed was growth-inhibitory, and became more
intense at concentrations causing inhibition of a secondary target
reversible by hypoxanthine (Figs. 1A and 2B).
The question arises whether the levels of ZMP seen in
pemetrexed-treated tumor cells are sufficient to play a role in the
inhibitory effects of pemetrexed. One can approach this question
by comparing the levels of ZMP that accumulate in pemetrexedtreated cells with those in cells whose growth is inhibited by the
ribonucleoside analogue of AICA, AICAR, whose substantial cytotoxicity is generally taken to be solely due to ZMP accumulation (11).
At growth-inhibitory concentrations of AICAR, cellular levels of
ZMP range from 0.4 to 2 nmol/106 cells, the same concentration
range seen after pemetrexed treatment. This would correspond to
0.4–2 mmol/L in cell water (Fig. 3). Hence, the ZMP levels seen in
pemetrexed-treated cells are sufficient to be at least partially causal
of the growth inhibition seen with pemetrexed.
Effects of accumulating ZMP on AMP-activated protein
kinase and the mTOR pathway. The accumulation of ZMP in
cells treated with AICAR and the substantial cytotoxicity of AICAR
is thought due to the activation of AMPK by ZMP leading, in turn,
to an inhibition of mTOR (11). These effects of AICAR were also
seen in CEM cells (Figs. 3 and 4B and C). We studied the activation
of AMPK by pemetrexed and thymidine. The phosphorylation
of the a-subunit of AMPK enhances the kinase activity of this
protein, but the phosphorylation of a direct target of AMPK, acetylCoA carboxylase (ACC), is a useful and direct indicator of the
activity of AMPK in intact cells (12). A 1-Amol/L concentration of
pemetrexed promoted activation of AMPK as shown by both direct

Figure 1. Reversal of CEM cell growth inhibition by AICA indicated that the second target of pemetrexed is AICART, not GART. CEM cells were treated with the
indicated concentrations of pemetrexed alone (A; No add ) or 6R-DDATHF (B ; No add ) or in the presence of thymidine (dTh ; 5.6 Amol/L), hypoxanthine (Hx ; 32 Amol/L),
AICA (320 Amol/L), or a combination of dTh with either hypoxanthine or AICA. Drug and modifying agents were added simultaneously and drug-containing
medium was changed at 48 h. Cell growth was determined after 96 h and cell number is expressed relative to controls without drug. C, the folate-dependent steps of
de novo purine synthesis and the site of entry of AICA and AICAR into the pathway. De novo purine synthesis consists of ten sequential enzymatic reactions starting

glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR ), and the product of this reaction FGAR, as well as the salvage of AICA, AICAR, and hypoxanthine catalyzed by adenine

phosphorylation at T172 and by an enhanced phosphorylation
of ACC at residue S79 (Fig. 4B). Activation of AMPK is known to
cause inhibition of mTOR by phosphorylation of TSC2, upstream
of mTOR, as well as a direct phosphorylation of the Raptor component of the mTORC1 complex (Fig. 4A; refs. 13, 14). Accordingly,
a robust hypophosphorylation of two key mTOR targets, 4EBP1 and
S6K1, was seen in pemetrexed-treated CEM cells (Fig. 4C), as well
as an increase in phosphorylation of S792 of Raptor (Fig. 4B). The
phosphorylation of S6K1 by mTOR is confined to a single residue
(T389; ref. 15), and this phosphorylation was eliminated by pemetrexed (Fig. 4C), whereas four residues on 4EBP1 are phosphory-

lated by mTOR (16); the broader migration pattern seen in
pemetrexed-treated cells with the pan-4EBP1 antibody (Fig. 3C)
suggests that several of these phosphorylation sites are affected by
drug. Thymidine was included in these experiments to separate the
effects of inhibition of thymidylate synthase from any effect caused
by accumulating ZMP. However, phosphorylation of AMPK and
hypophosphorylation of 4EBP1 were also observed in cells treated
with pemetrexed for 48 hours at doses as low as 0.1 Amol/L in the
absence of thymidine. The effects of pemetrexed on activation of

targets of mTOR were exacerbated in the presence of AICA (Fig. 5B),
in concert with the enhanced accumulation of ZMP seen under
these conditions (Fig. 5A).
Reversal of the effects of pemetrexed by hypoxanthine. It was
clear that a source of preformed purines, such as hypoxanthine,
reversed the effects of pemetrexed on its secondary target (Fig. 1A).
Initially, we thought this effect indicated a role for a diminution
of purine nucleotide pools by pemetrexed inhibition of AICART,
but direct measurement of ATP pools by high performance liquid
chromatography indicated that ATP levels not only did not decrease but also increased somewhat in pemetrexed-treated cells
in the absence of hypoxanthine (data not shown).1 Rather,
the mechanism of this hypoxanthine reversal of the secondary
target of pemetrexed seemed to be a prevention of the
accumulation of ZMP (Fig. 6A), presumably due to the known
feedback effects of an expanded purine pool on early steps in
purine synthesis (17, 18). As would be predicted, the inclusion of
hypoxanthine in the medium also decreased the phosphorylation
of ACC and Raptor as well as the hypophosphorylation of S6K1 and
4EBP1 caused by pemetrexed (Fig. 6B).
Compound C effects support the role of AMPK activation in
the pemetrexed-induced mTOR inhibition. The accumulation of

Others had previously shown that ATP pools were not diminished by pemetrexed
and, in fact, increased by about the factor we observed (37). We would suggest that
this effect is due to the block in cell cycle progression with pemetrexed, which
prevents the loss of purine nucleotides caused by DNA synthesis.

Pemetrexed Indirectly Inhibits mTOR

ZMP in pemetrexed-treated cells and the activating effects of
ZMP on AMPK suggest that the inhibition of mTOR by pemetrexed
is mediated by a ZMP-dependent activation of AMPK. To
determine the intermediacy of activation of AMPK in this
mechanism, the effects of an inhibitor of AMPK, compound C
(19), on the pemetrexed-induced mTOR inhibition were studied. As
expected, compound C inhibited the enhanced AMPK activity in
cells treated with pemetrexed and thymidine, as judged by an
inhibition of the phosphorylation of ACC (Fig. 6C). The effects of
1 Amol/L compound C on AMPK blocked the inhibition of mTOR
by pemetrexed, as judged by the hyperphosphorylation of S6K1 in
the presence of pemetrexed and compound C (Fig. 6C), a striking
contrast to the marked hypophosphorylation of S6K1 caused by
pemetrexed. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of AMPK in the
presence of pemetrexed and compound C was greater than that
seen with pemetrexed, in spite of the fact that compound C
diminished the level of ACC phosphorylation; this suggested that
compound C was blocking the activity of AMPK while allowing
phosphorylation of the a-subunit of AMPK. Overall, we concluded
that the effects of pemetrexed on the mTOR signaling pathway
were caused by the activation of AMPK by accumulation of ZMP.

Discussion
The search for new therapeutic agents useful against cancer has
focused on molecularly targeted small molecules. In ideal cases,
these would be agents inhibitory to steps unique to oncogenically

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

transformed cells that were not shared with normal stem cells
required for host survival. Such steps have rarely been identified,
although the Gleevec-sensitive BCR-Abl and Iressa-selective mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor protein are two wellstudied cases (20, 21). One of the most promising approaches
seems to be the design of therapeutic agents that affect pathways
dependent on tumor suppressor genes whose function is often
eliminated or dramatically altered during transformation. The
mTOR pathway responsible for balance of energy metabolism,
protein and lipid synthesis, and growth involves a series of
upstream controlling proteins recognized as tumor suppressor
proteins, including LKB1, PTEN, TSC1 and 2, and others recognized
as cellular oncogenes, such as AKT and PI3 kinase (8). Perhaps
the central element in this pathway that controls the influence
of the upstream tumor suppressor gene products/oncogenes on
the downstream direct activator of protein synthesis, mTORC1,
is AMPK, a protein kinase that phosphorylates the TSC1/TSC2
complex (13) and also directly inhibits mTORC1 by phosphorylation of the Raptor component of this complex (14). The AMPKphosphorylation of the TSC1/TSC2 complex inactivates the
Rheb GTP component needed for mTOR signaling. AMPK
is composed of three subunits, and activation of the catalytic
a-subunits is facilitated by binding of AMP to the g-subunit; ZMP
is thought to mimic the effect of AMP on the g-subunit (7, 22). In
this study, we make the case that the accumulation of ZMP
behind a block of AICART will activate AMPK and inhibit the
downstream activity of mTORC1.
The concept that the accumulation of a toxic substrate behind
a metabolic block could be used for therapeutics dates back to
the classic treatise by Webb on enzyme inhibition in vivo (23).
It is difficult to find examples in the chemotherapeutic literature,
but the accumulation of ZMP behind an AICART block that we
describe here makes a case for the utility and effectiveness of metabolite accumulation as a mechanism of anticancer agents. An
inhibitor of any linear metabolic pathway would be expected to
cause the accumulation of substrate behind the block, at least
transiently, and such accumulation could result in a limitation
of the effects of the inhibitor, e.g., the excessive accumulation of
dUMP in cells treated with precursors of FdUMP (24), or enhancement of an enzyme inhibitor, e.g., raltitrexid (25).
Why has inhibition of AICART by pemetrexed or its metabolites
not been found during prior surveys of folate enzymes for
sensitivity to this drug? Earlier in vitro analysis of the kinetics of
inhibition of several folate-dependent enzymes by pemetrexed and
its polyglutamates led to the conclusion that inhibition of AICART
was unlikely to contribute to the biological effects of this drug.
Thus, the Ki measured for recombinant human AICART for
pemetrexed itself was 3 Amol/L, and for the more potent longchain polyglutamate metabolites of pemetrexed was 0.26 Amol/L
when measured at a fixed concentration of ZMP (50 Amol/L),
whereas the activity of these compounds against GART was more
favorable but still not very high (Ki, 65 nmol/L). However, we herein
show that any effects of pemetrexed on de novo purine synthesis
in intact tumor cells are apparently due to effects on AICART,
not GART. The solution to this apparent dilemma may be in the
binding mechanisms of these two enzymes: GART can bind its two
substrates, glycinamide ribonucleotide and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate polyglutamates in a random manner (26), with either substrate
binding first, whereas AICART obeys an ordered sequential binding mechanism, with 10-formyltetrahydrofolate polyglutamates
binding first before ZMP can bind (27).

For AICART, when ZMP accumulates behind an initial blockade
of the pathway, the expanded ZMP pool would promote the
reformation of inhibited ternary complex whenever it dissociates to
binary AICART-pemetrexed complex. Hence, the likelihood that the
bound pemetrexed or its polyglutamates can leave the enzyme is
greatly diminished, an example of metabolic trapping of an
inhibitor on the enzyme active site by an expanded pool of second
substrate. This mechanism is formally identical to the metabolic
trapping of FdUMP on the surface of thymidylate synthase
responsible for the stabilization of TS ternary complexes by the
expanded pool of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate polyglutamates
induced by high doses of folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate; refs.
28, 29).
In theory, the secondary effect of pemetrexed reversible by a
combination of thymidine and purine (Fig. 1) might be due to an
inhibition of DHFR causing a cellular deficiency of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. There are four pieces of evidence that argue against
this interpretation: (a) The potency of pemetrexed and its metabolites against DHFR in vitro is quite low (72 nmol/L) compared
with the activity of pemetrexed polyglutamates against thymidylate
synthase (1.3 nmol/L) (ref. 4). (b) The substantial excess of DHFR
over thymidylate synthase in leukemic cells implies that DHFR
must be almost completely inhibited before any inhibition of cell
growth can occur (30). (c) The primary inhibition of thymidylate
synthase by pemetrexed polyglutamates would eliminate the
importance of any inhibition of DHFR, given evidence that DHFR
becomes irrelevant to cell survival or growth in the absence of
thymidylate synthase activity (31, 32). That is, substantial levels of a
DHFR inhibitor as potent as methotrexate are without effect on the
growth of leukemic cells exposed to a complete pharmacologic or

genetic block of thymidylate synthase. And (d) accumulation
of ZMP has been sought in methotrexate (MTX)-treated tumor
cells and does not occur, although MTX treatment does enhance
the ZMP accumulation in cells treated with AICAR (33).
This enhanced accumulation of ZMP made from AICAR in
methotrexate-treated cells is consistent with reports that
methotrexate results in inhibition of AICART both by depletion
of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate and by a direct inhibition of
AICART by methotrexate polyglutamates (34).
It was appreciated that pemetrexed targeted more than one site
since early in the development of this compound, but the multiple
targets were thought to all involve other enzymes on the folate
pathways (1, 2). We now present evidence that inhibition of AICART
by pemetrexed causes a mechanistically important but indirect
effect on the AMP-dependent kinase-mTOR pathway. We note that
this should be the case for any drug targeted against AICART, a
concept that suggests the development of drugs specifically against
AICART but without activity against thymidylate synthase. Pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR with direct inhibitors is currently of
substantial interest for cancer therapeutics, and current mTOR
inhibitors have shown activity against human lung cancers (35, 36).
Perhaps this spillover of the effects of pemetrexed to the mTOR
pathway explains the activity of pemetrexed in lung cancers, an
unusual pattern for classic antifolates.
