Abstract
Little knowledge exists about the mechanisms by which estrogen can impede chemotherapy-induced
cell death of breast cancer cells. 17β-Estradiol (E2) hinders cytotoxic drug–induced cell death in estrogen
receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancer cells. We noted that the activity of the proapoptotic mixed lineage
kinase 3 (MLK3) kinase was relatively higher in estrogen receptor–negative (ER−) breast tumors, suggesting
that E2 might inhibit MLK3 activity. The kinase activities of MLK3 and its downstream target, c-Jun NH2terminal kinase, were rapidly inhibited by E2 in ER+ but not in ER− cells. Specific knockdown of AKT1/2 prevented MLK3 inhibition by E2, indicating that AKT mediated this event. Furthermore, MLK3 inhibition by E2
involved phosphorylation of MLK3 Ser674 by AKT, attenuating the proapoptotic function of MLK3. We found
that a pan-MLK inhibitor (CEP-11004) limited Taxol-induced cell death and that E2 accentuated this limitation. Taken together, our findings indicate that E2 inhibits the proapoptotic function of MLK3 as a mechanism
to limit cytotoxic drug–induced death of ER+ breast cancer cells. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1731–40. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Estrogens comprise a group of structurally related, hormonally active molecules that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis (1). Estrogen occurs naturally in several
structurally related forms; however, the predominant form that
binds strongly to the cognate estrogen receptor α (ERα) is
17β-estradiol (E2). E2 binds to the nuclear ERα, causing dimerization of receptors that finally drives estrogen action by regulating transcription of target genes (1, 2). It is also reported that
E2 acts through rapid, nongenomic pathways (3, 4), where the
plasma membrane–localized ERα (5, 6) or G protein–coupled
receptor (GPCR) superfamily, termed GPR30, acts independent
of classic ERs to trigger rapid signaling by E2 (7, 8). Besides ERα,
ERβ (9–11) has also been reported, whose function is still not
well understood in hormonal signaling.
It is well documented that E2-mediated pathways play a
central role in the survival and proliferation of breast cancer
cells (1). Therefore, the agents that block either E2 synthesis
or antagonize E2-mediated pathways are in clinical use to

control the growth of ER+ breast cancer cells. Thus, the prevailing hypothesis in breast cancer field is that estrogen promotes survival of ER+ breast cancer cells by inhibiting the
proapoptotic cellular machinery. Although, recently, it has
been reported that E2 paradoxically promotes cell death in
long-term estrogen-deprived cells (12–15), the detailed mechanism is not well established. The mechanism by which estrogen promotes survival of ER+ breast cancer cells is also
not well understood. It is reported that the rapid action
of E2 activates Src (16–18) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)–AKT (19) pathways, coupled to the insulin-like
growth factor-I and epidermal growth factor receptors,
which might lead to increased cell survival. Whether E2 inhibits any proapoptotic kinase to provide growth advantage to
E2-dependent breast cancer cells is unknown.
Here, we report a role of a proapoptotic kinase, mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), which mediates the rapid action of E2
on the survival of ER+ breast cancer cells. MLK3 is a member
of MLK subfamily that belongs to the family of mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase kinases (20). The MLK family
members are characterized by the presence of signature sequences of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases within their
catalytic domain (20). Previous work by us and others have
shown that MLK family members, including MLK3 (20), activate the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; refs. 21, 22). We
showed that activation of JNK was mediated via direct phosphorylation and activation of upstream kinase, SEK1/MKK4,
by MLK3 (21). Furthermore, we reported that MLK3 was directly inhibited by AKT by a direct phosphorylation at a specific residue on MLK3 COOH-terminal regulatory domain
(23). Although the detailed function of MLKs, including
MLK3, is still unknown, it is reported that MLK3 behaves
as a proapoptotic kinase, leading to cell death on trophic factor withdrawal (24) or in response to neurotoxic assault in an

animal model of Parkinson's disease (25, 26). The in-depth
mechanism by which MLK3 or other MLK family members
control survival or death of breast cancer cells is yet to be
determined.
In this report, we show that MLK3 kinase activity was significantly higher in ER−, progesterone receptor–negative
(PR−) human breast tumors. Interestingly, the kinase activity
of MLK3 was inhibited in ER+ (MCF7 and ZR75-1) but not in
ER− (SkBr3) cell lines by E2. Furthermore, we show that E2induced inhibition of MLK3 kinase activity was mediated via
PI3K-AKT pathway and more specifically via AKT phosphorylation of MLK3 on Ser674. Induction of cell death mediated
via MLK3 in ER+ breast cancer cells was also attenuated by
E2. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition of all MLK activity
antagonized cytotoxic drug–induced cell death in ER+ breast
cancer cells, which was completely blocked in the presence
of both E2 and pan-MLK inhibitor combination. Taken together, our data show, for the first time, an important role
of MLK3 (and possibly other MLKs) in E2-mediated cell death
pathways in breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments. Human ER+ , MCF7 and
ZR75-1, and ER−, SkBr3 (American Type Culture Collection),
breast cancer cell lines and murine embryonic fibroblasts
(provided by Prof. Nissim Hay, University of Illinois, Chicago,
IL) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin
G/streptomycin) for 2 d. To elevate the estrogenic effect of
exogenously added E2, the cells were cultured in DMEM without phenol red supplemented with 5% charcoal-dextran–
stripped FBS, antibiotics, and 2 mmol/L glutamine for further
2 d. For E2 treatment, cells were starved for 12 h in DMEM
without phenol red supplemented with 0.2% charcoaldextran–stripped FBS and treated with or without 10 nmol/
L E2 (Sigma) at different time intervals, as indicated. For inhibitor treatment, the starved cells in phenol red–free DMEM were
pretreated, wherever indicated, with 50 μmol/L LY294002,
100 nmol/L wortmannin, 20 μmol/L AKT inhibitor VIII,
isozyme-selective, AKTi-1/2 (all from Calbiochem), and
10 nmol/L ICI 182,780 (Tocris Bioscience) for 2 to 3 h (as indicated) before E2 treatment. The pan-MLK inhibitor CEP-11004
(kind gift from Cephalon) was dissolved in DMSO and reconstituted in DMEM before treatment. To assess cell death
caused by Taxol, cells were pretreated with CEP-11004
(500 nmol/L) for 18 h and subsequently with E2 for 8 h and
then with paclitaxel/Taxol (1 μmol/L; Ivax Laboratories) for
24 h.
Immunoblotting. Western blot analysis was performed
following protocols described previously (22–24) by incubation with primary antibodies against phospho-AKT, total
AKT, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; all from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), phospho-JNK (Promega), and total
JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To determine whether
MLK3 is the substrate of AKT, phosphoserine/phosphothreonine AKT substrate antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was
used. The specific signals were finally detected using horse-

1732

radish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence.
Cell transfection. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected
with either Flag-tagged wild-type (WT) MLK3 or Flag-MLK3
S674A mutant using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies,
Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The endogenous
AKT1/2 in MCF7 cells was knocked down as described (27).
MCF7 cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000. Forty-eight hours
after transfection, cells were treated with E2 for 8 h, as described above.
Cell death assays. Apoptosis of cells was evaluated using a
Cell Death Detection ELISAPlus (Roche Diagnostics) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the
MCF7 cells were transfected with Flag-MLK3 and then treated
with E2 (10 nmol/L) for 8 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm and analyzed by the Cell Death Detection
ELISA kit. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
Immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. The breast tumors and matching normal breast tissue samples were freshly
collected and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen following Institutional Review Board–approved protocol. The
frozen tissues were homogenized in protein extraction buffer,
and endogenous MLK3 (from tissues or cells) was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies. Endogenous
MLK3 was immunoprecipitated by using an antibody raised
against the COOH-terminal peptide of MLK3, developed in
our laboratory (22–24). Ectopically expressed MLK3 was immunoprecipitated by using antibody against the Flag epitope
tag (Sigma). In vitro kinase assay was then performed following our published protocol (22–24). The incorporation of 32P
into SEK1 (K-R) was quantified by PhosphoImager (Storm
820, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences), and the kinase activity
was presented as arbitrary phosphoimager units.

Results
MLK3 kinase activity is significantly higher in ER−, PR−
breast tumors. To elucidate any role of MLK3 in breast cancer cell apoptosis, we estimated the catalytic activity of MLK3
in primary human breast tumors and matching normal breast
tissues. Our results showed that MLK3 kinase activity was
significantly higher in some tumors (∼10-fold or more) compared with the matching normal breast tissue (Fig. 1). Further analysis was then carried out to determine any link
between increased MLK3 activity with the ER and PR status
in these breast tumors. Surprisingly, these results revealed
that MLK3 kinase activity was ∼5-fold higher, exclusively
in the ER−, PR− compared with ER+, PR+ tumors (Fig. 1). Additionally, we also measured MLK3 kinase activity in five
more tumors. MLK3 kinase activity was about 5- to 12-fold
higher in the ER− tumors when compared with the ER+ breast
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1). Taken together, these
results suggested the possibility that MLK3 might be negatively regulated by E 2 -mediated pathways in ER + breast
cancer tumors.

Regulation of MLK3 by Estrogen

Estrogen negatively regulates MLK3 and its downstream
target JNK in ER+ but not in ER− breast cancer cell lines.
To understand any role of estrogen in regulating MLK3 kinase activity and its downstream events, we treated ER+
MCF7 and ER− SkBr3 cell lines with 10 nmol/L E2 for different time intervals (Fig. 2). The optimal dose of E 2 (i.e.,
10 nmol/L) to inhibit MLK3 kinase activity was determined
by dose course (data not included). Our results showed that
MLK3 kinase activity was rapidly inhibited by E 2 within
30 minutes of treatment with maximal inhibition (∼4.5-fold)
after ∼8 hours of E2 treatment in the ER+ MCF7 (Fig. 2A) but
not in ER− SkBr3 cells (Fig. 2B). To prove that inhibitory action of E2 on MLK3 kinase activity was not cell type dependent, we treated another ER+ breast cancer cell line, ZR75-1,
with E2 and estimated MLK3 kinase activity. Endogenous
MLK3 kinase activity in ER+ ZR75-1 cells was also inhibited
in a similar fashion as in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2C). To confirm
that the inhibition of MLK3 kinase activity in ER+ breast cancer cell lines was due to specific action of estrogen, we used
the antiestrogen compound ICI 182,780 (28) to block the effect of E2 in MCF7 cell line. The inhibitory effect of E2 on
MLK3 kinase activity was completely abrogated by ICI
182,780 compound (Fig. 2D). Our earlier studies showed that
MLK3 mediates downstream JNK activation via SEK1/MKK4
(21). Therefore, to determine whether E2-mediated inhibition
of MLK3 activity subsequently also leads to inhibition of its
downstream JNK kinase activity, we determined the activation status of JNK by using phospho-antibody directed
against the activation sites of JNK. Inhibition of MLK3 by
E2 also resulted in a corresponding inhibition of JNK activation in ER+ (Supplementary Fig. S2A) but not in ER− (Supplementary Fig. S2B) cell lines. These results showed that E2
indeed inhibits the kinase activities of MLK3 and its downstream JNK in ER+ breast cancer cells.
Estrogen inhibits MLK3 and JNK kinase activities via
PI3K-AKT pathway. Next, we wanted to know the mechanism by which E2 inhibits MLK3 and JNK kinase activities.
Our previous results showed that, on incubation with insulin,
AKT can phosphorylate and inhibit MLK3 kinase activity
(23). Because E2 is reported to activate PI3K-AKT pathway
in breast cancer cells (19), it was conceivable that the inhibitory effect of E2 on MLK3 kinase activity might be mediated
via PI3K-AKT pathway. To understand the contribution of
PI3K-AKT in these events, we first determined whether E2
activates AKT in an ER-dependent manner. Both ER +
MCF7 and ER− SkBr3 cells were treated with E2 for different
time intervals, and equal amounts of total cell lysates were
Western blotted with phospho-AKT antibody. In the MCF7
cells, E2 was able to activate AKT in a time-dependent manner and the maximal activation was observed in 8 hours of
E2 treatment (Fig. 3A), which corresponded with maximal
MLK3 inhibition (Fig. 2A). However, E2 was unable to activate AKT in the ER− SkBr3 cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that
E2 -mediated activation of AKT involves ER. To examine
any role of PI3K-AKT pathway on E2-mediated inhibition of
MLK3 activity, the ER+ MCF7 cells were pretreated with two
different pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K-AKT pathway
(LY294002 or wortmannin) and then treated with 10 nmol/

L E2 for 8 hours. MLK3 kinase assays performed following
these treatments showed that E 2 -induced inhibition of
MLK3 kinase activity was antagonized by both the inhibitors
of PI3K-AKT pathway (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that
E2 inhibits MLK3 kinase activity via activation of PI3K-AKT
pathway. We also observed that E2-induced inhibition of JNK
(a downstream target of MLK3) was regulated similarly by
PI3K-AKT inhibitors (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results
clearly suggest that E2 effects on MLK3 and its downstream
target JNK are mediated via PI3K-AKT pathway. However,
these results do not prove whether it is PI3K or AKT that
ultimately causes E2-induced MLK3 inhibition.
Protein kinase B (AKT) mediates the MLK3 inhibition by
estrogen. To understand whether the inhibitory effect of E2 is
mediated directly via AKT in ER+ MCF7 cells, we took advantage of AKT-specific inhibitor, AKTi-1/2, which is reported to
inhibit AKT specifically (29). The cells were pretreated with
AKT inhibitor followed by treatment with E2. As observed
earlier with the PI3K inhibitors, E2 was unable to inhibit
MLK3 kinase activity when the cells were pretreated with
AKT inhibitor (Fig. 4A), suggesting that AKT does mediate
the inhibitory effect of E2 on MLK3 kinase activity. To determine whether the AKT inhibitor used actually inhibits AKT
activity, the inhibitor-pretreated cell lysates were also blotted
with phospho-AKT antibody, which showed a complete inhibition of AKT phosphorylation following inhibitor pretreatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). Pharmacologic inhibitors of
PI3K and AKT have been used extensively to show direct role
of PI3K and AKT in cell signaling. However, use of these inhibitors does not rule out their potential nonspecific effects
on other pathways. To show specific role of AKT in E 2induced inhibition of MLK3 kinase activity, we first examined
the expression of various AKT isoforms in MCF7 cells. We
observed that AKT1 and AKT2 are both expressed in MCF7
cell line (Supplementary Fig. S4). To conclusively determine
the involvement of AKT, we then knocked down AKT1 and
AKT2 in MCF7 cells by using specific siRNA that was reported to knock down both AKT isoforms (27). Subsequently,
we examined whether E2 was able to inhibit MLK3 kinase
activity in the absence of endogenous AKT1/2. As shown in
Fig. 4B, E2 was able to inhibit MLK3 kinase activity in the parental cells but failed to do so in the absence of endogenous
AKT1/2 expression in MCF7 cells. As stated before, we have
shown earlier that insulin can inhibit MLK3 kinase activity
via direct phosphorylation of MLK3 by AKT (23). To know
whether AKT phosphorylates MLK3 on E2 treatment, we performed studies using a phospho-AKT substrate antibody that
recognizes the phospho-AKT substrates (30). Endogenous
MLK3 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates as described
in Fig. 4A, and the immunoprecipitates were blotted with
phospho-AKT substrate antibody. These results showed that
endogenous MLK3 was phosphorylated on E2 treatment and
this phosphorylation was blocked by AKT inhibitor (Fig. 4C),
suggesting that AKT does phosphorylate MLK3 on E2 treatment. To further define that the inhibitory effect of E2 on
MLK3 was via AKT-mediated phosphorylation, we used an
MLK3 mutant, where the AKT phosphorylation site was
mutated (23). This site on MLK3 was initially identified as

is significantly higher in ER−, PR− breast

the insulin-regulated phosphorylation site by AKT (23). The
MCF7 cells were transfected with either Flag-tagged MLK3
WT or MLK3 Ser674 Ala (MLK3 S674A) mutant and then
treated either with E2 or vehicle. In vitro kinase assays performed following immunoprecipitation of ectopic MLK3 using
the anti-Flag antibody showed that 10 nmol/L E2 was able
to inhibit ectopically expressed WT MLK3, reasonably to a
lesser extent compared with endogenous MLK3 (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, E2 was unable to inhibit the activity of MLK3 S674A
mutant, suggesting that E2-induced AKT does inhibit MLK3
via direct phosphorylation of the Ser674 site. Taken together,
these results convincingly prove that the inhibitory effect of
E2 in ER+ breast cancer cells is mediated via phosphorylation
of MLK3 by AKT.
Estrogen inhibits the proapoptotic activity of MLK3.
MLK3 has been shown to cause cell death in neuronal and
nonneuronal cells (23, 24), whereas E2 in most breast cancer
cells, especially in ER+ ones, causes survival (31, 32). E2 has
also been shown to have trophic effects on neuronal cells
(33–35). Because MLK3 and E2-mediated pathways have opposing effects, we wanted to know whether proapoptotic activity of MLK3 is antagonized by E2 in ER+ breast cancer cells.
To understand the effect of E2 on proapoptotic activity of
MLK3, MCF7 cells were transfected with WT MLK3 (which
was shown earlier to be constitutively active; ref. 21) and
then treated with either E2 or vehicle for 8 hours. The cell
lysates were blotted with anti-PARP antibody to determine
the effect of E2 on cell death induced by MLK3 expression.
We observed that MLK3 overexpression resulted in PARP
cleavage, which was significantly attenuated following E2
treatment (Fig. 5A), suggesting that E2 attenuates the cell
death activity of MLK3. We also measured the extent of cell
death in these cells by using the apoptosome assay. In this

1734

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

assay, E 2 again antagonized the cell death function of
MLK3 (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these results suggest that E2
downregulates the proapoptotic function of MLK3 in ER+
breast cancer cells.
MLK3-mediated cell death by cytotoxic drug is attenuated by estrogen. Cytotoxic drugs, such as Taxol, are generally
used to induce cell death in cancer cells, including breast
cancer cells (36). Our previous studies have shown that Taxol
and other cytotoxic drugs induce MLK3 kinase activity.6 We
thus wanted to know whether Taxol-induced cell death in ER
+
MCF7 cells is also antagonized by E2, and any possible link
of endogenous MLKs in mediating this effect. To perform
these studies, we used the available pan-MLK inhibitor CEP11004 that inhibits the activities of all MLK family members,
including MLK3 (25, 26, 37). The cells were pretreated with
CEP-11004 for 18 hours followed by treatment with E2 for
8 hours and then with Taxol for 24 hours, as indicated in
Fig. 6A. The cell death in these cells was determined by examining the cleavage of PARP. Taxol was able to induce cell
death in these cells as indicated by increased PARP cleavage
(Fig. 6A, lane 4), which was partially blocked by CEP-11004
(Fig. 6A, lane 6), suggesting the participation of MLK group
of kinases. Interestingly, Taxol-induced cell death was significantly reduced by E2 (Fig. 6A, lane 5) and completely blocked
by E2 and CEP-11004 combination (Fig. 6A, lane 7). These results suggest that MLK members, including MLK3, mediate
breast cancer cell death by Taxol, and this effect of Taxol
is down-modulated by inhibitory effect of E2 on MLK3 kinase
activity.

Regulation of MLK3 by Estrogen

Discussion
The overall goal of chemotherapy or radiotherapy for
breast cancer treatment is to promote cell death in the tumors
so that they can undergo regression and not metastasize
to different organs. Most of the modalities currently used
for breast cancer treatment result in cell death by modulating various cell death pathways (38). Thus, it is clear that any
impediment of the normal cell death pathways might lead to
drug resistance and breast cancer progression. It is well
documented that the steroidal hormone estrogen promotes

cell survival and proliferation of breast cancer cells by regulating the downstream signaling pathways via genomic and nongenomic actions of the hormone (1, 3, 39). Therefore, in ER+
breast cancer cells, agents that antagonize ER signaling pathway or block estrogen synthesis are expected to be effective in
promoting cell death (40). Detailed understanding of the pathway by which estrogen promotes cell survival and identification
of potential targets are necessary to design rational therapeutic
approaches to combat estrogen-dependent breast cancer.
Here, we show that the proapoptotic kinase MLK3 is a target of ER and define the mechanism by which ER antagonizes

MLK3 signaling. To define the role of MLK3 in breast cancer
cells, we measured MLK3 kinase activities in primary breast
tumors as a first step. We were perplexed initially to observe
that, in some tumors, the MLK3 kinase activities were very
high compared with others and also to the matching normal
tissues (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1). These results suggested that MLK3 might have some yet-to-be-identified
role in breast tumors. Further analysis and comparison of
the MLK3 kinase activities with the ER and PR status of
the breast tumors analyzed showed that there was a direct
correlation between ER and PR expression with MLK3 kinase
activities in these tumors. Our data clearly showed that
MLK3 kinase activities were significantly higher in ER−, PR
−
tumors (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1). These results suggested the possibility that estrogen might antagonize MLK3
activity and prompted us to examine the role of estrogen in
the regulation of MLK3 kinase activities. The treatment of
ER+ breast cancer cells with 10 nmol/L E2 significantly inhibited MLK3 kinase activities within 30 minutes (Fig. 2A); however, it was unable to inhibit the MLK3 kinase activity in ER−
breast cancer cells (Fig. 2B). These results, combined with
those obtained from the tumor samples (Fig. 1; Supplementary
Fig. S1), clearly showed that E2 negatively regulates MLK3 kinase activity in an ER expression–dependent manner. Inter-

1736

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

estingly, our data also suggested a nongenomic effect of E2
on initial MLK3 inhibition because MLK3 was inhibited within
30 minutes of E2 treatment (Fig. 2A); however, MLK3 was maximally inhibited at 8 hours of E2 treatment, which might be due
to genomic action of E2 for sustained inhibition. Nonetheless,
irrespective of genomic or nongenomic action of E2 on MLK3
kinase activity, our data clearly suggest that the E2 effect was
specific because the antiestrogen compound ICI 182,780
blocked the inhibitory action of E2 on MLK3 kinase activity
(Fig. 2D).
Activation of JNK in neuronal and nonneuronal cells has
been shown to cause cell death (23, 24). It has also been reported that MLK3 causes cell death via JNK activation (41,
42), and thus, one possible downstream effect of E2-mediated
MLK3 inhibition in breast cancer cells might be to antagonize MLK3/JNK-induced cell death. We also observed that inhibition of MLK3 in ER + breast cancer cells leads to
inhibition of JNK (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that
MLK3 regulates JNK activity in these cells. Whether MLK3

is activated by E2 (45). Because earlier we reported that AKT
directly phosphorylates MLK3 and inhibits its activity (23), it

Regulation of MLK3 by Estrogen

was tempting to determine whether estrogen regulates MLK3
activity via the AKT pathway. It is possible that, during breast
cancer pathogenesis, the prosurvival pathways regulated by
E2 down-modulate the proapoptotic function of MLK3 via
AKT activation. We observed that AKT indeed phosphorylated MLK3 following E2 treatment, which was determined
by phospho-AKT substrate antibody (Fig. 4C). This conclusion
was further confirmed by using the phospho-deficient MLK3
mutant that lacks the AKT phosphorylation site (Fig. 4D).

As prevailing clinical and nonclinical data support the prosurvival functions of estrogen pathway, it was expected that
probably inhibition of MLK3 by E2 will promote survival of
breast cancer cells. The inhibition of MLK3 kinase activity
by E 2 attenuated the proapoptotic functions of MLK3
(Fig. 5), suggesting that, under normal conditions, MLK3
and perhaps other MLKs might regulate the normal cell
death pathway in breast epithelial cells. The biggest challenge for any cancer treatment, including breast cancer, is

Figure 4. Protein kinase AKT mediates the MLK3 inhibition by E2. A, MCF7 cells were pretreated with 20 μmol/L of AKT-specific inhibitor (AKTi-1/2) for
2 h and then treated with E2 (10 nmol/L) for 8 h. MLK3 kinase assay was performed as described in Fig. 1. B, MCF7 cells were transfected with
AKT1/2-specific siRNA for 48 h and then treated with 10 nmol/L E2 for 8 h. The cell lysates were first used to judge the knockdown of total AKT and
then used to measure MLK3 kinase activity. C, MLK3 was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody and immunoblotted for anti–phospho-AKT
substrate antibody. D, MCF7 cells were transfected with either Flag epitope–tagged MLK3 WT or MLK3 S674A mutant expression vectors and then treated
with E2 (10 nmol/L) for 8 h. MLK3 was immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag antibody and kinase assay was performed as described in Fig. 1. These
data represent one of three similar experiments (for A, C, and D) and one of two (for B).

Figure 5. Proapoptotic activity of
MLK3 is inhibited by E2. A, MCF7
cells were transfected with Flag
epitope–tagged MLK3 (WT) and
then treated with E2 (10 nmol/L)
for 8 h. Cell lysates were
immunoblotted with anti-PARP
antibody. Equal expression of
MLK3 was detected by anti-Flag
antibody and β-actin was used as
a loading control. B, apoptosis

to overcome the resistance that these cells acquire toward
induction of cell death in response to cytotoxic drugs. Based
on the facts that (a) MLK3 or other MLK members are proapoptotic kinases and (b) cytotoxic drugs activate MLK3
kinase activity,6 it is conceivable that inhibition of these protein kinases by E2 might antagonize cytotoxic drug–induced
cell death. In fact, pretreatment of ER+ cells with a combination of pan-MLK inhibitor CEP-11004 and E2 completely abrogated cytotoxic drug–induced cell death (Fig. 6A), thus
confirming that MLK3 or some yet-to-be-identified MLK

family members play an important role in modulating breast
cancer cell death.
Based on our current data and published results, we propose a model of MLK3 inhibition by E2 that finally leads to
down-modulation of cell death pathway in ER+ breast cancer
cells (Fig. 6B). E2 can bind to both ERα and GPCR at the membrane or to the nuclear ERαs, resulting in their dimerization.
The binding of E2 to membrane-localized ERα or GPCR initiates the nongenomic action of E2 that causes activation of
AKT via PI3K. Once AKT is activated, it phosphorylates

Regulation of MLK3 by Estrogen

MLK3 at Ser674 site, resulting in inhibition of MLK3 kinase
activity. Inhibition of MLK3 attenuates JNK activity and finally blocks the transcription of proapoptotic genes via AP-1
transcription factor. At the same time, nuclear ERα binds to
estrogen response elements and promotes transcription of
prosurvival genes. Therefore, a combination of nongenomic
action of E2 on AKT-MLK3-JNK pathway and genomic action
via upregulation of prosurvival factors finally shifts the balance toward cell survival.
In conclusion, our data provide an insight toward the role
of MLK3 in ER+ breast cancer cell survival. Our biochemical
data clearly show that E2 inhibits the MLK3 kinase activities
and, by doing so, downregulates its proapoptotic function.
This E2 effect is physiologic because MLK3 was highly active
in ER−, PR− breast tumors but not in ER+, PR+ tumors. The
detail role of MLK3 in ER−, PR− breast cancer pathogenesis is
a challenging one and is one of our focuses for future studies.
Interestingly, our data also show that inhibition of MLK3
by E2 is mediated via AKT phosphorylation of MLK3 on
the Ser674 site. We have also shown earlier that MLK3 is ac-

tivated by ceramide (22), and it is reported that ceramide
inhibits AKT (46). Therefore, it seems likely that agents that
can activate MLK3 and inhibit AKT simultaneously might
prove beneficial to promote cell death in ER+ breast cancer
cells.
