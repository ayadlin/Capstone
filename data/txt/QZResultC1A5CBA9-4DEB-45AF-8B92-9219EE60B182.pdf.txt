CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is one of 19 members of the chemokine receptor subfamily of
human Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). CCR2 is expressed on monocytes,
immature dendritic cells and T cell subpopulations, and mediates their migration towards
endogenous CC chemokine ligands such as CCL21. CCR2 and its ligands are implicated in
numerous inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases2 including atherosclerosis, multiple
sclerosis, asthma, neuropathic pain, and diabetic nephropathy, as well as cancer3. These disease
associations have motivated numerous preclinical studies and clinical trials4 (see
ClinicalTrials.gov) in search of therapies that target the CCR2:chemokine axis. To aid drug
discovery efforts5, we solved a structure of CCR2 in a ternary complex with an orthosteric
(BMS-6816) and allosteric (CCR2-RA-[R]7) antagonist. BMS-681 inhibits chemokine binding by
occupying the orthosteric pocket of the receptor in a previously unseen binding mode. CCR2-RA[R] binds in a novel, highly druggable pocket that is the most intracellular allosteric site observed
in Class A GPCRs to date; this site spatially overlaps the G protein-binding site in homologous
receptors. CCR2-RA-[R] inhibits CCR2 non-competitively by blocking activation-associated
conformational changes and formation of the G protein-binding interface. The conformational
signature of the conserved microswitch residues observed in double-antagonist-bound CCR2
resembles the most inactive GPCR structures solved to date. Like other protein:protein
interactions, receptor:chemokine complexes are considered challenging therapeutic targets for
small molecules, and the present structure suggests diverse pocket epitopes that can be exploited to
overcome drug design obstacles.

A ternary complex between an engineered construct of human CCR2 isoform b (further
referred to as CCR2-T4L or simply CCR2), an orthosteric antagonist BMS-681 (compound
13d in6), and an allosteric antagonist CCR2-RA-[R]7 was crystallized using the lipidic cubic
phase method8, and the structure was determined to 2.8 Å resolution (Extended Data Table 1
and Extended Data Fig. 1). Simultaneous addition of two compounds dramatically stabilized
detergent-solubilized CCR2-T4L in comparison with twice the concentration of each
compound individually (Fig. 1a), suggesting concurrent binding of CCR2-RA-[R] and
BMS-681 to the receptor. The presence of both compounds was critical for crystallization.

Author Manuscript

In the structure, CCR2 adopts the canonical fold of class A GPCRs with seven
transmembrane (TM) helices connected by three extracellular (EC) and three intracellular
(IC) loops (Fig. 1b). Both compounds are visible (Fig. 1b–d); BMS-681 binds in the
extracellular orthosteric pocket (Fig. 1b, c) while CCR2-RA-[R] is located more than 30Å
away (Fig. 1b, d), in a site that is the most intracellular allosteric pocket observed in Class A
GPCRs to date (Fig 1e). The binding site of CCR2-RA-[R] spatially overlaps with the G
protein-binding site in homologous receptors (Fig 1f). As for other chemokine receptors9–12,
CCR2 is expected to have two conserved disulfide bonds in its extracellular domains, with
Cys32-Cys277 connecting the N-terminus (NT) to ECL3, and Cys113-Cys190 connecting
TM3 to ECL2. Electron density is apparent for the ECL2-TM3 disulfide bond but not for the
NT residues 1–36 or the NT-ECL3 disulfide bond (Fig. 1b, c). Because the NT-ECL3
disulfide bond has been shown important for CCR2 signaling13, its absence is unlikely to be
an inherent feature of the receptor; instead, it might be caused by strain of the bond in the

ligand-bound state of the receptor14, possibly exacerbated by solvent exposure and radiation
damage of the crystals15.

Author Manuscript

As with other chemokine receptors, the extracellular orthosteric pocket of CCR2 can be
divided into a major and a minor subpocket, defined by helices III–VII and helices I–III,
VII, respectively, and separated by residues Y1203.32 and E2917.39 (superscript indicates
residue number as per Ballesteros-Weinstein nomenclature). BMS-681 binds predominantly
in the minor subpocket (Fig. 2a,b) and buries 366.3 Å2 of surface area. The 6trifluoromethyl quinazoline moiety protrudes between helices I and VII towards the lipid
bilayer, while the tri-substituted cyclohexane packs against W982.60. The γ-lactam
secondary exocyclic amine forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of T2927.40, which is
critical for binding of chemically related compounds such as BMS-558 (compound 22 in 16)
and the Teijin lead series17,18. This amine is also within hydrogen bonding distance from the
backbone carbonyl of Q2887.36. The carbonyl oxygen of the γ-lactam forms a hydrogen
bond with Y491.39, which itself is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of T2927.40. The N1
nitrogen of the quinazoline is within 4 Å of the Q2887.36 side chain. The protonated tertiary
amine on the cyclohexane ring is proximal to a structured water molecule in the binding site.
Some CCR2 antagonists, particularly those containing a basic amine, are known to depend
on the conserved E2917.39 in the receptor19; however, no direct interaction is observed
between E2917.39 and BMS-681. The receptor-bound, bioactive conformation of BMS-681
is strikingly similar to the crystallographic conformation of free BMS-681 (Fig. 2c,
Extended Data Table 2) suggesting the absence of internal strain in the bound state.

Author Manuscript

BMS-681 engages several residues that are critical for CCL2 binding and/or activation of
CCR217,18 including Y491.39, W982.60, Y1203.32, and T2927.40. Thus, it seems to directly
compete with chemokine binding to the orthosteric pocket. Additionally, by inserting
between helices I and VII, BMS-681 may put strain onto residues C32-V37 connecting TM1
to ECL3, destabilize the conserved NT-ECL3 disulfide bond (absent in the structure), and
prevent the N-terminus and TM1 from adopting a productive chemokine binding
conformation observed in homologous receptor:chemokine structures11,12 (Extended Data
Fig. 2).

Author Manuscript

On the opposite side of the receptor, CCR2-RA-[R] is caged by the intracellular ends of
helices I–III and VI–VIII and buries 297.8 Å2 of surface area. The inner hydrophobic part of
the cage is made by V631.53, L671.57, L812.43, L1343.46, A2416.33, V2446.36, I2456.37,
Y3057.53, and F3128.50, while the outer (cytosol-facing) polar part consists of T772.39,
R1383.50, G3098.47, K3118.49, and Y3158.53 (Fig. 2d, e), as well as the backbones of
engineered R2376.29 and K2406.32. The binding pocket of CCR2-RA-[R] is highly enclosed
and possesses a balanced combination of hydrophobic and polar features, all of which favors
pocket “druggability”5. Owing to the lack of a side-chain on G3098.47, the hydroxyl and
pyrrolone carbonyl groups of CCR2-RA-[R] can hydrogen-bond to the exposed backbone
amides of E3108.48, K3118.49, and F3128.50 (Fig. 2d, e). The acetyl group of the compound
resides near the terminal amine of K3118.49. The critical roles of V2446.36, Y3057.53,
K3118.49, and F3128.50 in CCR2-RA-[R] binding were established by an earlier mutagenesis
study20. Because homologs of several residues in the CCR2-RA-[R] binding pocket directly
couple to the G protein in bovine rhodopsin21 and the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR)22

structures (Extended Data Fig. 3), CCR2-RA-[R] appears to sterically interfere with G
protein binding to CCR2.

Author Manuscript

The structure suggests an interesting symmetric mechanism for the concurrent antagonistic
action of the two compounds. BMS-681 interferes with chemokine binding directly and with
G protein coupling indirectly, by stabilizing an inactive, presumably G proteinincompatible6 conformation of the receptor. Conversely, CCR2-RA-[R] directly prevents G
protein coupling and allosterically inhibits binding of the CCL2 chemokine23, which, like
most GPCR agonists, requires an active, G protein-associated receptor for high affinity
binding23. Bi-directional allosteric communication between the extra- and intracellular sides
of the receptor is reminiscent of that previously observed in adenosine A2A receptor
(AA2AR)24 and β2AR25 using allosteric inverse agonist antibodies/nanobodies that target the
same epitope as CCR2-RA-[R]. Similar to these antibodies, CCR2-RA-[R] was previously
shown to allosterically enhance, and to be allosterically enhanced by, binding of orthosteric
antagonists23, i.e. to demonstrate positive binding cooperativity.

Author Manuscript

We further characterized this cooperativity by studying the binding of BMS-681 to WT
CCR2 and the crystallization construct CCR2-T4L using previously characterized
radioactive probes [3H]-INCB-334423 (orthosteric) and [3H]-CCR2-RA (allosteric). In
equilibrium competition binding assays on WT CCR2, both INCB-3344 and CCR2-RA-[R]
displaced their homologous radioligand with IC50 values of 17 and 13 nM, respectively
(Extended Data Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Table 3), comparable to previously reported
values23. Compared to WT CCR2, the affinity of both antagonists towards CCR2-T4L was
improved by approximately 2-fold, suggesting a slight engineering-related shift towards the
inactive state. BMS-681 fully displaced [3H]-INCB-3344 with nanomolar affinities for both
constructs, but did not displace [3H]-CCR2-RA. Instead, at 1 μM concentration it enhanced
the binding of [3H]-CCR2-RA by >30% (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Table
3).

Author Manuscript

In kinetic radioligand experiments, the presence of BMS-681 also increased total binding of
[3H]-CCR2-RA to both WT CCR2 and CCR2-T4L, with the increase as high as 62% in the
case of CCR2-T4L (Extended Data Fig. 4c–d, and Extended Data Table 4). 1μM BMS-681
decreased the dissociation rate constant of [3H]-CCR2-RA, while producing a slight increase
(WT CCR2) or no change (CCR2-T4L) in the observed association rate constants.
Moreover, in CCR2-T4L, the presence of BMS-681 changed the biphasic dissociation
profile of [3H]-CCR2-RA to monophasic, suggesting stabilization of the receptor population
in a homogenous conformational state (Extended Data Table 4). Along with the stability and
equilibrium binding data, these results further corroborate the hypothesis that BMS-681 and
CCR2-RA-[R] cooperatively stabilize a preferred inactive conformation of CCR2-T4L.
We next analyzed the structure of double-antagonist-bound CCR2-T4L to better understand
this conformation. The plethora of existing class A GPCR structures suggests a conserved
conformational signature of an active receptor state26. This signature involves separation
between the intracellular end of helix VI and the rest of the TM bundle, an inward
repositioning and rotation of helix VII, and concerted repacking of the highly conserved
microswitches R3.50 (of the DR3.50Y motif), Y5.58, and Y7.53 (of the NPxxY7.53 motif) (Fig.

3a, b) to form an intracellular binding interface for G protein. Furthermore, rather than
adopting either an “on” or “off” state, receptors can occupy an ensemble of intermediate
conformations27. The active state signature is fully represented in US28, the only agonistbound chemokine receptor crystallized to date12 (Fig. 3a–c). By contrast, the doubleantagonist-bound CCR2 structure appears to occupy the opposite end of the activation
spectrum as it shares the conformational microswitch signatures of the most inactive GPCR
structures observed thus far (Fig. 3a–e).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

As in the inactive CCR5:Maraviroc complex10, the intracellular ends of CCR2 helices III
and VI are close together, and the conserved R3.50 interacts with D3.49 and T2.39, effectively
disrupting the G protein binding pocket (Fig. 3b, d, e). Similarly, in both CCR2 and CCR5
structures, the intracellular end of helix VII is in the inactive outward-facing conformation
with Y7.53 pointing towards helix II rather than the center of the bundle. However, in CCR5,
Y5.58 is oriented towards the center of the bundle, whereas in the present CCR2 structure, it
faces the lipid and is sterically blocked from approaching R3.50 and Y7.53 by F6.38 (Fig. 3d,
e). The net result of these interactions is that the crystallographically observed conformation
of CCR2 appears to be even more inactive than that of CCR5 and most similar to dark
rhodopsin28 and Fab-bound β2AR29. Although receptor construct engineering appears to
contribute to stabilization of this inactive state, the ligand binding and thermal denaturation
data suggest that the concerted action of the two antagonists is also important. By directly
interacting with the conserved activation microswitch residues, CCR2-RA-[R] is perfectly
positioned to stabilize this inactive state: it sterically blocks Y7.53 from populating the active
conformation and is propped against R3.50, restricting its orientation away from the G
protein interface (Fig. 3b). Although located 30 Å away, BMS-681 appears to cooperate with
CCR2-RA-[R] through their common interactions with helix VII, which moves outward on
the intracellular side (opposite to its movement during activation) and inward on the
extracellular side (relative to CCR5 and US28) (Fig. 3f).

Author Manuscript

The CCR2 structure has general implications for the design of drugs targeting chemokine
receptors as a family. As with most protein:protein interfaces, the orthosteric binding
pockets of chemokine receptors are large, wide open, and highly polar. Chemokines explore
numerous hotspots within these pockets and their binding is additionally reinforced by the
interaction with the flexible N-termini of the receptors11,12 (Fig. 4a), collectively making for
an extensive and versatile interaction that is conceptually difficult to inhibit with small
molecules. The CCR2:BMS-681:CCR2-RA-[R] structure extends the repertoire of ideas that
can be employed to overcome these obstacles. The binding mode of BMS-681 (Fig. 4b)
contrasts with both the binding mode of Maraviroc to CCR5 (Fig. 4c) where the ligand spans
the major and the minor subpocket of the receptor, and that of IT1t to CXCR4 (Fig. 4d)
where the ligand is entirely accommodated in the minor subpocket. While occupying the
minor subpocket of CCR2, BMS-681 protrudes between helices I and VII towards the lipid
bilayer (Fig. 4b) in an interaction facilitated by the trifluoromethyl group that is often
present in CCR2 antagonists30. This interaction enables hydrophobic anchoring of BMS-681
to the otherwise polar and open binding site of CCR2; by doing so, it parallels the role of
other unique non-polar subpockets exploited by crystallized small molecule antagonists of
CCR5 and CXCR4 (Fig. 4b–d). The novel subpocket explored by BMS-681 may have an

additional advantage of disrupting the chemokine-compatible conformation of the receptor
N-terminus (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Author Manuscript

CCR2-RA-[R] demonstrates a previously unseen binding mode within an allosteric pocket
on the intracellular side of CCR2. Although relatively small, this pocket has a desirable
balance of polarity and hydrophobicity (Fig. 2e and 4e). Homologous pockets may be
present in other chemokine receptors, owing to a conserved G8.47; in fact, compound
binding in homologous regions has been indirectly demonstrated for CCR1 and CCR5, and
directly for CCR431, CXCR1, and CXCR232. In most other receptors that have been
crystallized thus far, the non-glycine residue at position 8.47 appears to both reduce the
pocket volume and block access to the backbone amides of helix 8; consequently, the
homologous pockets in these receptors may not be druggable although negative allosteric
modulation with antibodies and nanobodies targeting the same region has been reported24,25.
By simultaneously competing with G protein and blocking activation-related conformational
changes, compound binding in the allosteric pocket appears a powerful way to antagonize
the receptor. Therefore, for those receptors in which the allosteric pocket is druggable,
targeting it with small molecules may open new avenues for GPCR drug discovery.

Methods
Design and Expression of CCR2-T4L fusion constructs

Author Manuscript

The sequence of human CCR2 isoform b (Uniprot ID P41597-2) was engineered for
crystallization by truncation of C-terminal residues 329–360 and by grafting T4 lysozyme
(T4L) into the ICL3. In the process of construct optimization, the native CCR2 residues
between L2265.62 and R2406.32 (L2265.62-KTLLRCRNEKKRH-R2406.32) were removed
and replaced with corresponding residues from the crystallized structure of M2 muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor (PDB ID 3UON, resulting amino-acid sequence S2265.62-RASKSRIT4L-PPPSREK-K2406.32). The presence of T4L in ICL3 is expected to prevent receptor
activation; however the similar affinities of BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[R] for both WT CCR2
and CCR2-T4L (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Table 3) suggest that the fusion
construct is a good surrogate of WT CCR2 for understanding ligand recognition.

Author Manuscript

The CCR2-T4L coding sequence was cloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen)
with an HA signal sequence followed by a FLAG tag at the N-terminus and a PreScission
protease site followed by a 10xHis tag and another FLAG tag at the C-terminus. The
receptor was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. High-titer recombinant
baculovirus (>109 viral particles per ml) was obtained using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus
Expression System (Invitrogen) as previously described11. Sf9 cells at a cell density of 2–3
× 106 cells ml−1 were infected with P1 virus at an MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 5. Cells
were harvested by centrifugation 48 h post-infection and stored at −80 °C until use.
Purification of CCR2-T4L
Insect cell membranes were prepared by thawing frozen cell pellets in a hypotonic buffer
containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl and EDTA-free complete
protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Extensive washing of the raw membranes was

performed by repeated douncing and centrifugation in the same hypotonic buffer (2–3 times)
and then in a high osmotic buffer containing 1.0 M NaCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM
MgCl2, 20 mM KCl and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (3–4 times),
thereby separating soluble and membrane associated proteins from integral transmembrane
proteins. 40 mM stock solutions of BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[R] were made in isopropanol.
Washed membranes were resuspended into a buffer containing 50 μM BMS-681, 2 mg/ml
iodoacetamide, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, and incubated at
4 °C for 1 h before solubilization. The membranes were then solubilized in 50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace), 0.2%
(w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS, Sigma) at 4 °C for 3 h. The supernatant was isolated
by centrifugation at 50,000g for 30 min, and incubated in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM
NaCl with TALON IMAC resin (Clontech) overnight at 4 °C. After binding, the resin was
washed without addition of ligands with 10 column volumes of Wash I Buffer (50 mM
HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) DDM, 0.02% (w/v) CHS,
10 mM imidazole), followed by 4 column volumes of Wash II Buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH
7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) DDM, 0.01% (w/v) CHS, 50mM
imidazole). The protein was then eluted with 3–4 column volumes of Elution Buffer (50 mM
HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 μM BMS-681, 400 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) DDM,
0.01% (w/v) CHS, and 250 mM imidazole). PD MiniTrap G-25 columns (GE Healthcare)
were used to remove imidazole. The protein was then treated overnight with His-tagged
PreScission protease to cleave the C terminal His-tag and Flag-tag. PreScission protease and
the cleaved C-terminal fragment were removed by binding to TALON IMAC resin for 2 h at
4 °C. The protein was collected as the TALON IMAC column flow-through. The protein
was supplemented with 75 μM each of BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[R] before being
concentrated to 30mg/ml with a 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off Amicon centrifuge
concentrator (Millipore). The estimated final compound concentrations were ~ 1–2 mM for
both compounds.

Crystallization

The thermostability of CCR2-T4L was analyzed by a differential scanning fluorimetry
(DSF) assay adapted from previous publications33 using a RotorGene Q 6-plex RT-PCR
machine (Qiagen). Briefly, 1–5 μg of protein was mixed with 3 μM 7-Diethylamino-3-(4′Maleimidylphenyl)-4-Methylcoumarin (CPM) dye (2.5 mM stock in DMSO) in 25 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 0.02% DDM, 0.004% CHS, 10% glycerol, and indicated
concentrations of compounds to a final volume of 20 μL; samples were incubated for 5 min
at room temperature and then heated gradually from 28 °C to 90 °C at a rate of 0.8 °C/min,
with CPM fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 460 nm) recorded every 1 °C. The
melting temperature (Tm) was determined from the first derivative of the denaturation curve,
using the Rotor-Gene Q – Pure Detection software (version 2.0.3).

Purified CCR2 in complex with BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[R] was reconstituted into lipidic
cubic phase (LCP) by mixing with molten lipid using a mechanical syringe mixer8. The
protein-LCP mixture contained 40% (w/w) receptor solution, 54% (w/w) monoolein and 6%
(w/w) cholesterol. Crystallization trials were performed in 96-well glass sandwich plates

protein-laden LCP and 800 nL of precipitant solution per well. Plates were incubated and
imaged at 20 °C. Initial crystal hits were found from a precipitant condition containing 100
mM MES, pH 6.5, 30% (v/v) PEG400, 100 mM Li2SO4. After optimization, diffraction
quality crystals were obtained from 100 mM MES, pH 6.5, 30–32% (v/v) PEG400, 75–85
mM Li2SO4. Crystals usually grew to a maximum size of 60 μm × 10 μm × 10 μm in one
week, and were harvested directly from the LCP matrix using MiTeGen micromounts and
flash cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Data collection and structure determination

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

X-ray diffraction data were collected using a 10 μm collimated minibeam at a wavelength of
1.0332 Å with a Pilatus3 6M direct detector on the 23ID-D beamline (GM/CA CAT) of the
Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory. Crystals were located and
aligned by the rastering strategy34. Among the several hundred crystal samples screened,
most crystals diffracted to 2.8–3.5 Å resolution when exposed to 0.3 s of unattenuated beam
using 0.3° oscillations. A 93.1% complete data set at 2.80 Å resolution was obtained by
merging data from 17 crystals, using XDS35 and Aimless36. As the data showed anisotropy,
the UCLA Diffraction Anisotropy Server (http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/anisoscale/) was used
to truncate the data to 3.0 Å along both a* and b* axes, and to 2.81 Å along the c* axis.
Initial phase information was obtained by molecular replacement (MR) with the program
Phaser37 using the receptor portion of the CCR5 structure (PDB ID: 4MBS) converted to
polyalanines, and the T4L portion of the CXCR4 structure (PDB ID: 3ODU) as search
models. The correct MR solution (TFZ=14.8) contained one CCR2-T4L molecule in the
asymmetric unit. Refinement was performed with Phenix38 followed by manual examination
and rebuilding of the refined coordinates in the program COOT39 using both |2Fo| - |Fc| and |
Fo| - |Fc| maps, as well as omit maps. The final model includes 295 residues (37 to 225 and
241–319) of the 360 residues of CCR2 and residues 2 to 161 of T4L plus 16 residues of two
8-residue linkers. The remaining N- and C-terminal residues are disordered and were not
built. Strong electron density for one metal ion was observed. The identity of the ion was
determined to be Zn2+ by X-ray fluorescence scans (Extended Data Fig. 5). The zinc ion is
coordinated by a water molecule as well as side chains of H1443.56, E238, and E1005. Data
collection and refinement statistics is shown in Extended Data Table 1.
Crystallization and structure determination of BMS-681

Author Manuscript

BMS-681 was dissolved in a minimal amount of CH3CN and then 15% water was added.
After standing overnight, the resulting crystals were harvested. Data were collected on a
Bruker-AXS X8-Proteum Kappa goniometer and APEXII detector. Intensities were
measured using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with the crystal kept at a constant
temperature using an Oxford cryo system during data collection. Indexing and processing of
the measured intensity data were carried out with the SAINT-APEX2 (Bruker-AXS)
program suite, structure solution with SHELXS-97 and structure refinement with
SHELXL-97.
The derived atomic parameters (coordinates and temperature factors) were refined through
full matrix least-squares. The function minimized in the refinements was Σw (|Fo| - |Fc|)2. R

is defined as Σ ||Fo| - |Fc||/Σ |Fo| while Rw = [Σw (|Fo| - |Fc|)2/ Σw |Fo|2]1/2 where w is an
appropriate weighting function based on errors in the observed intensities. Hydrogens were
introduced in idealized positions with isotropic temperature factors, but no hydrogen
parameters were varied. It should be noted that the refinement model illustrates significant
disorder and partial occupancy factors of ‘guest’ solvent/water molecules within the
crystalline lattice. The atomic positions of these disordered molecules were taken from the
difference map analysis, which showed peaks of electron density of varying intensities at the
refined positions representing the disordered solvent/water molecules. Data collection and
refinement statistics is shown in Extended Data Table 2.
Cell culture and transfections

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (provided by Hans den Dulk, Leiden University, The
Netherlands; originally obtained from and certified by ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium/F-12 Nutrient Mixture (DMEM/F-12) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) newborn calf serum, 50 IU/mL penicillin and 50μg/mL streptomycin; and maintained
at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured twice a week at a ratio of 1:30 to 1:50 by
trypsinization. Transient transfection of CHO cells with WT CCR2 and CCR2-T4L
constructs was performed using a polyethylenimine (PEI) method, as described previously23.
Briefly, CHO cells were grown on 15 cm ø to around 50% confluence and then transfected
with a DNA/PEI mixture containing 10 μg plasmid DNA – previously diluted in 150 mM
NaCl solution – mixed with PEI solution (1 mg/mL) at a 1:6 DNA:PEI mass ratio. Before
adding 1 mL of the transfection mixture to each plate, the culture medium of the cells was
refreshed and the mixture incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Following transfection,
cells were incubated for 48 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 before membrane preparation. 24 h after
transfection, sodium butyrate was added to each plate at a final concentration of 3 mM to
increase receptor expression. CHO cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination before
use, the outcome of which was negative.
Membrane preparation

Author Manuscript

Membranes from CHO cells transiently expressing the WT CCR2 or CCR2-T4L were
prepared as described previously23. Briefly, cells were detached from 15-cm ø plates using 5
mL of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000g. The membranes were
separated from the cytosolic fractions by several centrifugation and homogenization steps.
First, the pellets were resuspended and homogenized in ice-cold membrane buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl buffer, supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) using an Ultra Thurrax
Homogenizer (IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG; Staufen, Germany). Homogenized membranes
were then centrifuged in an Optima LE-80 K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc.,
Fullerton, CA) at 31,000g for 20 min at 4°C. The final membrane pellet was resuspended
also in ice-cold membrane buffer and aliquoted before storage. Membrane aliquots were
stored at −80°C and protein concentrations were measured using a standard BCA protein
determination assay (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL USA).
Radioligand binding assays
[3H]-INCB-3344 (specific activity 32 Ci mmol−1) and [3H]-CCR2-RA (specific activity 63
Ci mmol−1) were custom-labeled by Vitrax (Placentia, CA). JNJ-27141491 was synthesized

as described previously40. INCB-3344 and CCR2-RA-[R] were synthesized in-house as
described previously7,41.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

All radioligand binding assays were performed at 25 °C in a 100 μL reaction volume
containing assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% CHAPS) and
30 μg of membrane protein from CHO cells transiently expressing WT CCR2 or CCR2T4L. For competition binding assays with [3H]INCB-3344, a concentration of 5 nM
[3H]INCB-3344 was used, and non-specific binding was determined with 10 μM of
unlabeled INCB-3344. In the case of [3H]-CCR2-RA competition binding assays, a
radioligand concentration of 3 nM was used and non-specific binding was determined with
10 μM of JNJ-27141491. In all cases, homologous or competition displacement assays were
carried out using six increasing concentrations of competing ligands. Kinetic experiments
were also performed at 25 °C using 7 nM [3H]-CCR2-RA and 30 μg of membrane protein in
a 100 μL reaction volume. For association experiments, CHO-CCR2 or CHO-CCR2-T4L
membranes were added to the reaction at 8 different time points, in the absence or presence
of 1μM BMS-681. For dissociation experiments, membranes were first incubated with
radioligand for 90 min, dissociation was then initiated by addition of 10 μM of CCR2-RA[R] at 12 different time points, in the presence or absence of 1μM BMS-681. A higher
number of time points were used in the dissociation assays, in order to characterize the
biphasic profile of [3H]-CCR2-RA dissociation. In all cases, total radioligand binding did
not exceed 10% of the total radioligand added to avoid ligand depletion. For all experiments,
incubation was terminated by dilution with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer
(pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% CHAPS). Separation of bound from free radioligand was
achieved by rapid filtration over a 96-well GF/B filter plate using a Perkin Elmer Filtermateharvester (Perkin Elmer, Groningen, the Netherlands) and filter-bound radioactivity was
determined in a Perkin Elmer 2450 Microbeta2 plate counter after addition of 25 μL
Microscint scintillation cocktail per well (Perkin-Elmer, Groningen, the Netherlands).
Statistical Methods

Author Manuscript

All radioligand binding data were analysed using Prism 6.0 and 7.0 (GraphPad software, San
Diego, CA, USA). The pIC50 values were obtained by non-linear regression analysis of
competition displacement assays. Apparent association rate constants (kobs) and maximum
binding (Bmax, used to calculate %B/Bcontrol) were determined by fitting the association data
to a one-phase exponential association function. Dissociation rate constants were determined
by fitting the dissociation data to a monophasic (koff) or biphasic (koff,fast and koff,slow)
exponential decay model. All data shown represent means ± S.E.M of at least three
independent experiments performed in duplicate. An unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test
was used to compare differences in pIC50 as well as differences in kinetic parameters.
Differences in binding enhancement (%Binding) in the absence (set at 100%) or presence of
BMS-681 were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-hoc test. Significant
differences are denoted as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 ****p < 0.0001.

of the CCR2 N-terminus and helix I

a, Model of CCR2:CCL2 built by homology from the structure of CXCR4:vMIP-II11
suggests that a productive chemokine-compatible conformation of the receptor requires reorientation of the N-terminus from almost parallel to almost perpendicular to the membrane
plane, and formation of an extra helical turn in helix I to bring it closer to helix VII and
ECL3. b, Binding of BMS-681 may disrupt this chemokine-compatible conformation by
inserting between helices I and VII.
