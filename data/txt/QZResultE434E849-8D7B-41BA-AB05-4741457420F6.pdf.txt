Abstract
One of the most detrimental hallmarks of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is cellular invasiveness, which is
considered a potential cause of tumor recurrence. Infiltrated GBM cells are difficult to completely eradicate
surgically and with local therapeutic modalities. Although much effort has focused on understanding the various
mechanisms controlling GBM invasiveness, its nature remains poorly understood. In this study, we established
highly serial intracranial transplantation. U87R4 cells were highly invasive and displayed stem cell-like
properties, as compared to noninvasive but proliferative U87L4 cells. Microarray analysis during serial
transplantation revealed that apoptosis-inducing genes (caspase3 and PDCD4) were downregulated whereas
several cancer stem cell–relevant genes [Frizzled 4 (FZD4) and CD44] were upregulated in more invasive cells.
U87R4 cells were resistant to anticancer drug–induced cell death, partly due to downregulation of caspase3 and
PDCD4, and they retained activated Wnt/b-catenin signaling due to upregulation of Frizzled 4, which was
sufficient to control neurosphere formation. We also found that FZD4 promoted expression of the epithelial to
mesenchymal transition regulator SNAI1, along with acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype. Taken together,
our results argue that Frizzled 4 is a member of the Wnt signaling family that governs both stemness and
invasiveness of glioma stem cells, and that it may be a major cause of GBM recurrence and poor prognosis.

genesis continues to accumulate, human GBM still remains
one of the most incurable human malignancies.
The infiltrative property of GBM cells is one of the major
causes of tumor recurrence and patient lethality, because
GBM cells that infiltrate toward normal parenchymal tissues
are hard to eradicate with local therapeutic modalities and are
extremely resistant to various anticancer therapies (2).
Recently, several histopathological features of GBM suggested
that this tumor arises from cancer stem cells (or cancerinitiating cells) that retain many properties similar to normal
neural stem cells, such as self-renewal and the potential for
multidifferentiation, giving rise to tumor heterogeneity (3). A
growing body of evidence has demonstrated that multiple
stemness factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF; 4),
hedgehog (5), notch (6), Wnt (7), and Id4 (8), which play
pivotal roles in genesis and maintenance of embryonic and
adult stem cells, are activated in many types of malignancies
and are sufficient to generate cancer stem cells in cell culture
and mouse model systems.
In particular, Wnt signaling is frequently activated in colorectal cancers, melanomas, breast cancers, and gliomas due to
loss of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) function and/or gain
of b-catenin activity. The Wnt/b-catenin pathway also induces
cell migration, which is necessary for pattern formation and
differentiation during embryonic development (9) and tumor
progression (10). Wnt signaling is also considered a stemness

Frizzled 4 and Glioma Invasiveness

regulator that promotes cellular invasiveness through regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in many
types of malignancies (7, 11–13). Such evidence suggests at
least 2 possibilities: (i) invasive glioma stem cells (GSC) may be
a major cause of tumor recurrence, and (ii) Wnt signaling may
be a potential driver that leads to acquisition of both stemness
and invasiveness in GBM cells. However, these possibilities are
not well understood in relation to GBM recurrence.
In this study, to understand the potential invasiveness of
GSCs and tumor recurrence, we established 2 different cell
lines: a highly invasive glioma cell line (U87R4 cells) and a
noninvasive cell line (U87L4 cells) from U87MG glioma cells
following 4 rounds of serial in vivo orthotopic transplantation.
We found that U87R4 cells retained several GSC features, such
as aggressive tumorigenicity, robust invasiveness, neurosphere formation, neural stem cell marker expression, and
resistance to anticancer drug-induced cell death. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that increased expression of
the signaling regulator Frizzled 4 (FZD4), upregulated Wnt
signaling, and decreased caspase3 and PDCD4 expression in
U87R4 cells were responsible for acquisition of GSC-like
properties and resistance to apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and neurosphere formation
U87MG cells [which are purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC)] were maintained in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) enriched with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCOBRL), and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (GIBCO-BRL) for fewer than
6 months after receipt. This cell line was authenticated by
ATCC with the use of various tests, including DNA profiling,

and cytogenetic analyses. For the neurosphere formation
assay, cells were plated into 96-well plates at a density of 1
cell per well and maintained in neural stem cell culture
conditions (Neurobasal, a medium enriched with 20 ng/mL
EGF, 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor, 1  B27, N2, and
1% penicillin/streptomycin) for 10 to 14 days.
Intracranial transplantation and establishment of
invasive cell lines
Cultured cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin/0.02%
EDTA for 2 minutes, washed twice with Hank's balanced salt
solution (HBSS), and resuspended in Ca2þ/Mg2þ-free HBSS.
Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Only
single-cell suspensions with more than 90% viability were used
for in vivo studies. Cells (2  105) in 5 mL HBSS were stereotactically injected into the left striata of nude mice (6-week-old
BALB/c nu/nu; coordinates: anterior–posterior, þ2.2; medial–
lateral, þ2.5; dorsal–ventral, 2.2 mm from Bregma). When
body weight had decreased more than 25%, mice were considered to have GBM. Brains with tumors were mechanically
and enzymatically dissociated into single cells, red blood cells
were removed by differential centrifugation. The remaining
cells (106 cells) were labeled with 1 mL fluorescence isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-H-2Kb antibody (BD Pharmingen). H-2Kb-populations were sorted using a FACSAria
machine (BD Biosciences), and tumor cells were cultured in
the conditions described above. This procedure was repeated 4
times to enrich for nonmigratory and migratory glioma cells. In
addition, RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction) was performed to determine the purity of human
cell population by amplifying a human b-actin cDNA fragment
with human-specific b-actin primer set. R1 and R3 cells were
cultured for 3 consecutive passages (3 weeks) to attain

sufficient numbers of cells (2  106 cells) for intracranial
injections, while R2 and R4 cells were cultured for 5 to 6
passages to perform intracranial injections and in vitro studies.
All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with
government and institutional guidelines and regulations.

Results
In vivo selection of highly invasive GBM cells
To establish highly invasive subclones from human GBM
cell lines, U87MG glioma cells were stereotactically injected
into the left hemisphere of brains of immunocompromised
mice (BALB/c nude). When GBMs formed, the brains were
harvested and divided in half coronally. GBM subclones
derived from primary culture of the left and right hemispheres
after intracerebral implantation were denoted L1 (noninvasive
cells derived from left brain hemispheres) and R1 (highly
invasive cells established from right brain hemispheres),
respectively. To further enrich cells with an invasive potential,
we repeated this procedure 3 more times, establishing L4 from
L1 and R4 from R1 (Fig. 1A). At each step, H-2Kbþ mouse cells
were excluded from the recovered cultures (<2%) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to ensure that the L4 and R4
subclones were of human origin (data not shown).

U87L4 cells were mainly comprised of cells showing epithelial-like rounding morphology (Fig. 1B; left photograph),
whereas most U87R4 cells showed mesenchymal-like cell
features, such as a long spindle shape (Fig. 1B; right photograph). Furthermore, histological examination demonstrated
that U87R4 cell-derived tumors displayed peripheral invasion
of the surrounding brain as single cells and cell clusters,
compared to U87L4-driven tumors (Fig. 1C). Of note, when
cultured continuously for more than 15 passages under conventional culture conditions (DMEM þ 10% FBS), the majority
of U87L and U87R cell populations retained mixed epithelialand mesenchymal-like cell types, similar to U87MG parental
cells. Therefore, we used relatively early passage U87L and
U87R cells (less than 5 passages) to compare their cellular and
genetic characteristics. When determining tumorigenic capability in vivo, we observed that the survival periods of tumorbearing mice that were intracranially implanted with U87L2
and U87R2 cells were significantly shorter than those of mice
bearing tumors derived from U87MG parental cells (Fig. 1D).
This result may be due to enrichment of tumor cells that
retained a highly tumor-initiating potential during serial in
vivo transplantation. Although the median survival of U87R2injected mice was relatively shorter than that of U87L2injected mice, there was no significant difference in the

overall survival rates (Fig. 1D). Notably, we found that survival
periods of U87R4-injected mice were longer than those of
U87L4-injected mice and U87L2- and U87R2-injected mice
(Fig. 1D). Although we did not determine a precise reason for
this observation, the longer survival of U87R4-injected mice
might be attributed to a lesser proliferative property of U87R4
cells compared with U87L4 cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, it is
likely that U87L4 cells displayed rapid tumor growth compared to U87R4, and increased U87L4-driven tumor burden
might lead to earlier death by impairing normal brain function
(data not shown). Conversely, the invasive U87R4 cells generated relatively dispersed tumors with smaller tumor mass
(Fig. 1C) that might exert a lesser damage to normal brain
function than U87L4-injected mice.
Cellular characteristics of U87L4 and U87R4 cells
To validate the in vivo invasive properties of U87R4 cells, we
conducted an in vitro invasion assay using a transwell culture
system. U87R4 cells were more invasive than U87L4 cells in
Matrigel-coated transwell cultures (Fig. 2A). U87R4 cells
showed a significant reduction in cell proliferation compared
to U87L4 cells (Fig. 2B). Because a recent study reported that
human U87MG and T98G glioma cells contain a subpopulation of glioma stem-like cells (14), we compared glioma stemlike cell properties of U87L4 and U87R4 cells by investigating
their serial neurosphere forming ability and GSC marker
expression. U87R4 cells formed more neurospheres that were
larger, compared to U87L4 cells (Fig. 2C and D). Furthermore,
in contrast to U87L4 cells, the sphere numbers of U87R4 cells
gradually increased from passage 1 to passage 3, indicating
that although both U87L4 and U87R4 cells retained a population of cancer stem cells, the number of glioma stem-like cells
was higher in U87R4 cells than U87L4 cells. We examined GSC
markers, such as CD133 and nestin (15) in neurospheres

derived from U87L4 and U87R4 cells using immunofluorescence and found that U87R4-derived neurospheres showed
increased nestin and decreased CD133 expression compared
to U87L4-derived neurospheres (Fig. 2D), suggesting that
neurospheres derived from U87R4 and U87L4 cells may contain different types of glioma stem-like cells.
Gene expression signature in highly invasive U87R4
cells
To examine the signaling pathways promoting the invasiveness of GBM cells, gene expressions in invasive subclones
(U87R2 and U87R3 cells) and noninvasive, proliferative subclones (U87L2 and U87L3 cells) were compared using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays containing more
than 47,000 human transcripts. We found that 4 genes
(RANKL, DISC1, CD44, and FZD4) were significantly upregulated, and 4 genes (caspase3, SMAD6, MAML3, and PDCD4)
were downregulated in U87R4 cells compared to U87L4 cells
(P < 0.05; Table 1). Next, we validated the expression levels of
differentially expressed genes in U87R4 and U87L4 cells using
real-time RT-PCR. FZD4 are involved in Wnt/b-catenin signaling, which plays crucial roles in cancer stem cell genesis
and cell migration by inducing EMT in many types of malignancies, such as colorectal and breast cancers (7). CD44 is a
cancer stem cell marker expressed in various cancer types,
including breast cancers (16). RANKL is associated with
osteogenesis (17), but its role in cancer stem cells has not
been studied. Because U87R4 cells showed phenotypes resembling glioma stem-like cells, we focused on FZD4, CD44, and
RANKL among the upregulated genes, and found that expression levels of all these genes were significantly upregulated in
U87R4 cells compared to U87L4 cells (Fig. 3A). Among the
downregulated genes in U87R3 cells, SMAD6 is an inhibitor
of TGF-b signaling that is associated with cell cycle arrest

(18, 19). Caspase3 and PDCD4 are well-known factors driving
cell death in a variety of normal and cancer cells (20, 21). We
found that expression levels of caspase3 and PDCD4, but not
SMAD6, were significantly reduced in U87R4 cells compared
to U87L4 cells (Fig. 3B). To evaluate the gene expression
patterns in the U87R cells derived from serial in vivo intracranial transplantation assays, we compared expression of
FZD4, RANKL, CD44, SMAD6, caspase3, and PDCD4 in U87R2
and U87R4 cells, and found that FZD4 and PDCD4 levels in
U87R4 cells were higher than those in U87R2 cells, whereas
caspase3 levels in U87R4 cells were lower than U87R2 cells
(Fig. 3C), implying that FZD4-high and caspase3-low expression pattern might be an advance signature of U87R4 cells,
which is achieved during serial in vivo intracranial transplantation. Taken together, these results suggest that U87R4 cells
display cellular features resembling glioma stem-like cells,
such as a stemness and resistance to apoptosis, via activation
of Wnt signaling and inactivation of cell death regulators.
Decreased caspase3 and PDCD4 expression and
resistance to an anticancer drug in U87R4 cells
Because highly invasive cancer cells often retain resistance
to cell death from various physiological and pharmacological
insults (22), and our mRNA expression data showed decreased

3070

Cancer Res; 71(8) April 15, 2011

expression of caspase3 and PDCD4 in U87R4 cells, we examined whether U87R4 cells were resistant to anticancer druginduced cell death compared to U87L4 cells. U87R4 cells were
significantly more resistant to staurosporine than U87L4 cells
(Fig. 4A). To examine whether this resistance was associated
with downregulation of caspase3 and PDCD4, we stably
depleted expression of caspase3 or PDCD4 in U87L4 cells
using short hairpin RNA interference (shRNAi). As shown in
Figure 4B, over 50% of caspase3 and PDCD4 expression was
successfully reduced in U87L4 cells transduced with caspase3or PDCD4-shRNAi, as compared to U87L4 cells transduced
with nonspecific scrambled shRNAi. Individual depletion of
caspase3 or PDCD4 in U87L4 cells led to marked increases in
resistance to staurosporine- or temozolomide-induced cell
death (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S1), whereas the
transient overexpression of caspase3 in U87R4 cells led to
relative decrease in resistance to staurosporine (STS)- or
temozolomide-driven apoptotic stimulus (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S1). However, STS, but not temozolomide,
significantly increased sensitized cell death in U87R4 cells that
are transiently overexpressing PDCD4 (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Together, our data suggest that resistance to anticancer drugs may result from decreased expression of caspase3
and PDCD4 in U87R4 cells.

FZD4 leads to acquisition of glioma stem cell properties
through activation of canonical Wnt/b-catenin
signaling
Several previous studies have demonstrated that FZD4
activates the canonical Wnt pathway, which plays a pivotal
role in controlling stemness in normal and malignant tissues
(23–25). To evaluate whether the canonical Wnt pathway was
activated and FZD4 was involved in activation of Wnt signaling in U87R4 cells, we examined activation of b-catenin, a
crucial regulator in the canonical Wnt pathway, in U87R4 cells
and in U87L4 and U87R4 cells subjected to gain- and loss-offunctions of FZD4, respectively. In the canonical Wnt pathway,
b-catenin is released from destruction complex (Axin APC and
GSK3) via phosphorylation by CKIa and GSK3b and becomes
stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus (26). Nuclear
b-catenin then forms a nuclear complex with T-cell factor
(TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor to activate transcription of
target genes (27). We found that the expression level and
transcriptional activity of b-catenin were markedly increased
in U87R4 cells compared to U87L4 cells, as determined by
Western blotting and TOP/FOP luciferase reporter assays (28;
Fig. 5A). Furthermore, when treated with lithium chloride
(LiCl), which activates b-catenin by inhibiting GSK3b (29),
U87L4 cells showed marked increases in expression and
transcriptional activity of b-catenin at a similar level to those
of U87R4 cells (Fig. 5A). Overexpression of FZD4 in U87L4 cells
(U87L4-FZD4) resulted in marked increases in nuclear accumulation of b-catenin protein and its transcriptional activity,
whereas depletion of FZD4 in U87R4 cells (U87R4-shFZD4)

www.aacrjournals.org

dramatically decreased nuclear accumulation of b-catenin
(Fig. 5B). When grown in neural stem cell culture conditions
that promote GSCs to form neurospheres (30), neurosphere
numbers from U87R4 cells were markedly increased when
compared to neurospheres from U87L4 cells. Furthermore,
overexpression of FZD4 in U87L4 cells resulted in a significant
increase in neurosphere formation compared to U87L4-control cells, whereas depletion of FZD4 in U87R4 cells resulted in
a marked decrease in neurosphere formation compared to
control U87R4-shScramble cells (Fig. 5C). Thus, overexpression of FZD4 in U87R4 cells is sufficient to promote b-catenin
expression and neurosphere formation.
Next, we examined expression of FZD4, nestin, CD133, and
b-catenin in the margin and core regions of tumors derived
from U87R4 and U87L4 cells, as well as 2 human primary
GBM specimens. Expression of FZD4 and nuclear b-catenin
was detected in tumor cells restricted to the margin of
U87R4-derived tumors and human primary GBM specimens
compared to the core region of the same tumors, and both
the margin and core regions of U87L4-derived tumors
(Fig. 5D). Therefore, FZD4-mediated activation of Wnt signaling at the invasive front, but not in the core region of
tumors derived from U87R4 cells and human primary GBM
specimens suggests that this signaling may be regulated by
both cell autonomous and nonautonomous mechanisms.
Nestin expression was predominately observed in cells confined to the invasive front and perivascular glioblastoma
stem cell niche (31) in U87R4 tumors and human primary
GBM specimens, whereas CD133 expression was mainly

detected in tumor cells localized in the core region of U87L4derived tumors. Therefore, FZD4high/Nestinhigh/CD133low
cells may represent a "mesenchymal" subtype of GSCs
(see the Discussion section).
FZD4 regulates a mesenchymal-like cell phenotype via
SNAI1 induction
Because Wnt/b-catenin signaling promotes EMT in many
types of malignancies (32, 33), we assessed whether FZD4 was
associated with glioma cell invasiveness. U87L4-FZD4 cells
showed a significant increase, whereas U87R4-shFZD4 cells
displayed a marked decrease, in cell invasion in Matrigelcoated transwell cultures, compared to their corresponding

control-transfected cells (Fig. 6A). EMT is regulated by several
transcriptional factors such as twist, SNAIl, and slug during
normal development and in malignant states (34). Thus, we
investigated whether FZD4 regulates expression of EMT-regulating transcriptional factors. We found that U87R4 cells
expressed higher levels of SNAI1 protein (Fig. 6B), but not
mRNA (data not shown), than U87L4 cells, and furthermore,
SNAI1 protein expression was increased in U87L4-FZD4 cells
and decreased in U87R4-shFZD4 cells (Fig. 6B). However, twist
expression was not altered in U87L4 and U87R4 cells by gain or
loss of FZD4 expression. Slug was not expressed at detectable
levels by Western blotting in either U87L4 or U87R4 cells (data
not shown).

Frizzled 4 and Glioma Invasiveness

Figure 6. FZD4 leads to acquisition of a mesenchymal-like cell phenotype through SNAI1 induction. A, in vitro invasion assay of U87L4-Hygro, U87L4-FZD4,
U87R4-shScramble, and U87R4-shFZD4 cells grown in Matrigel-coated transwell cultures. **, P < 0.01 (n ¼ 3). B, expression levels of FZD4, TWIST1, SNAI1,
and vimentin proteins were determined with Western blotting. Immunofluorescence images show vimentin expression (red). DAPI (blue) was used to
stain nuclei. C, representative immunohistochemical images showing expression of vimentin in margin and core regions of each tumor derived from U87R4
and U87L4 cells, as well as 2 human GBM specimens. D, mRNA expression levels of various mesenchymal markers (vimentin, FSP1, SMA, and vitronectin)
in control and SNAI1-depleted U87R4 cells.

Consistent with SNAI1 expression, expression of the
mesenchymal marker vimentin was increased in FZD4-overexpressing cells (U87R4 and U87L4-FZD4 cells), whereas
vimentin was decreased in cells with reduced FZD4 expression (U87L4 and U87R4-shFZD4 cells; Fig. 6B). Furthermore,
vimentin was abundantly expressed in tumor cells restricted
to the margin of U87R4-derived tumors and human primary
GBM specimens compared to the core of the same tumor,
and both the margin and core regions of U87L4-derived
tumors (Fig. 6C). To determine whether FZD4-mediated
acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics in U87R4 cells
was due to SNAI1 induction, we depleted SNAI1 expression
in these cells using SNAI1-specific siRNA. Decreased SNAI1
expression in U87R4 cells was associated with the loss of
expression of various mesenchymal marker mRNAs: vimentin, fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1), smooth muscle
alpha actin (SMA), and vitronectin (Fig. 6D). Furthermore,
we compared expression levels of EMT-relevant genes from
microarray, and found that expression levels of several EMTrelevant genes, including vimentin, YKL40, MMP3, microRNA21, fibroblast activating protein (FAP), Twist1, and fibronectin (FN1), increased more than 2-fold in U87R3 cells compared with U87L3 cells (data not shown). Therefore, U87R4
cells appear to display a mesenchymal-like cell phenotype
and highly invasive features that may be regulated by FZD4SNAIl expression.

Finally, we examined whether FZD4 is also implicated in
invasive features of GSCs derived from 3 GBM patients (35).
The FACS and transwell culture assays revealed that FZD4positivity in GSCs correlated with their invasiveness (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Furthermore, FZD4high GSC4 showed a
significantly increased invasion compared to FZD4low GSC4
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). We also examined expression levels
of GSC (nestin and CD133) and EMT (vimentin and E-cadherin) markers in 3 FZD4high GSCs using FACS analysis. All 3
FZD4high GSCs displayed high levels of nestin and vimentin,
while low levels of CD133 and E-cadherin (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). Taken together, our findings that FZD4 regulates
cancer stemness and invasiveness have implication for the
cellular origin of mesenchymal subtype of GSCs in experimental and clinical trials setting.

Discussion
Despite advances in multimodal treatments such as surgery,
radiation, and chemotherapy, the poor prognosis of patients
with GBM is largely attributed to the highly invasive feature of
GBM cells. Invasive GBM cells infiltrate into the surrounding
brain parenchyma and escape surgical resection and local
therapeutic modalities, and are considered a principle reason
for tumor recurrence (36). Because identifying mechanisms
and/or driving factors governing the invasiveness of GBM cells

is mandatory for development of therapeutic strategies that
inhibit tumor recurrence, establishment of a highly invasive
glioma cell model by serial in vivo orthotopic transplantation
provides more insight into glioma cell invasiveness.
Our results indicate that the GSC-like feature of U87R4 cells
was regulated by increased FZD4 expression, which activated
canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling. Although Wnt signaling
plays a pivotal role in the genesis and maintenance of cancer
stem cells in many types of malignancies including colorectal
cancers (37), its function is less characterized in human GBM.
Although we were not able to directly validate FZD4 expression
in patients with GBM due to a lack of GBM specimens containing the marginal region of the tumor and normal tissues
compared to GBM specimens containing the tumor core
region, our results indicate that FZD4 is a critical Wnt signaling
component that is activated in highly invasive GBM cells.
In this study, we demonstrated that the highly invasive
U87R4 cell line retained several GSC properties, such as neurosphere formation, nestin expression, and resistance to proapoptotic drugs. Interestingly, U87R4 cells showed decreased
CD133 and increased CD44 expression, which is consistent
with our previous study showing that primary CD133-negative
GBM cells give rise to neurospheres and heterogeneous tumors
and show more invasive growth and a more "mesenchymal"
subtype genetic signature compared to CD133-positive GBM
cells (35). Moreover, other groups have also suggested that
primary CD133low and CD44high GSCs possess a "mesenchymal"
gene signature and cellular phenotypes similar to adult neural
stem cells compared to CD133high and CD44low GSCs that show
"proneural" transcriptional profiles and less invasiveness in in
vitro culture conditions, similar to fetal neural stem cells (38–
40). Furthermore, invasive mesenchymal GSCs (CD133low and
CD44high) express a higher level of FZD6 and possess activated
Wnt signaling compared to noninvasive proneural GSCs
(CD133high and CD44low; 38).

Although we did not address how FZD4 regulates posttranscriptional expression of SNAI1, Wnt signaling may
increase EMT by increasing SNAI1 protein stability by not
only inhibiting GSK3b-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent polyubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation, but also nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of GSK3b by
Axin2, a target gene of the b-catenin/TCF complex (11, 13).
Therefore, our findings that ectopic expression of FZD4 in
U87L4 cells led to a mesenchymal-like morphological change
along with increased vimentin and SNAI1 expression, and
depletion of SNAI1 in U87R4 cells resulted in decreases in
vimentin and other mesenchymal marker expression indicate
that an EMT-like event in U87R4 cells likely occurs via FZD4dependent induction of SNAI1.
Taken together, our results suggest that FZD4 promotes
induction of glioma stem cell-like cells with a highly invasive
potential by activating canonical Wnt signaling, and may be a
novel therapeutic target for suppressing tumor invasion and
recurrence.
