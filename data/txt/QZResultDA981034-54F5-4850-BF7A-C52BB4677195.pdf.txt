ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Current
therapeutic options are sparse and the prognosis of patients suffering from this
disease is grim. Abundance in intratumoral heterogeneity among different deregulated
signaling pathways is a hallmark of glioblastoma and likely accounts for its recurrence
and resistance to treatment. Glioblastomas harbor a plethora of deregulated pathways
driving tumor formation and growth. In this study, we show that TIC10/ONC201, a
promising compound that is currently in planned clinical development, along with
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition by ABT263 yields a strong synergistic antiproliferative effect on
pediatric, adult, proneural glioblastoma and glioma stem-like cells. On the molecular
level, treatment with TIC10/ONC201 results in a posttranslational decrease of
the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), through
modulation of the chaperone Bag3 and the deubiquitinase Usp9X. Consistently, the
combination treatment of TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263 required the presence of
functional BAX and BAK to drive intrinsic apoptosis, but is surprisingly independent
of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, the expression of Noxa protein was
required for efficient apoptosis induction by TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263. Importantly,
the drug combination of TIC10/ONC201 and the BH3-mimetic, ABT263, led to a
regression of tumors in vivo, without any notable toxicity and side effects. Overall,
TIC10/ONC201 along with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition holds significant promise as a novel
potential approach for the treatment of recalcitrant tumors such as glioblastoma.

for the development of therapeutic resistance [3]. It seems
unlikely that concomitant activation of different proneoplastic signaling pathways, which furthermore vary
among different cancer cells within the same tumor, will
be successfully addressed by one “magic bullet”. From
that perspective, a multi-targeted therapeutic approach
seems to hold more promise.

INTRODUCTION
For many solid tumor entities including
glioblastoma, efficient therapeutic strategies still do
not exist. Despite vast efforts, current standard of care
provides glioblastoma patients only with a negligible
survival benefit [1, 2]. With the advancement of
modern molecular techniques, our understanding of
cancer biology has rapidly grown and points out that
intratumoral heterogeneity represents one driving force

for compounds inducing tumor necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in cancer cells [4].
In this study, Allen et al. showed that treatment with
TIC10/ONC201 resulted in dual inhibition of AKT
and ERK signaling followed by dephosphorylation of
Foxo3a, subsequent nuclear translocation and enhanced
transcription of TRAIL. In preclinical studies, TIC10/
ONC201 was shown to inhibit various pro-neoplastic
features of different cancer types such as breast cancer,
colorectal cancer as well as lung cancer [4–7]. In addition,
TIC10/ONC201 provides several favorable characteristics
with respect to a potential future clinical application
such as its capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and
a preserved activity when administered orally [8]. These
features also render the compound particularly interesting
for combinatorial therapeutic strategies targeting brain
tumors.
Among the most significant regulators of
programmed cell death are the members of the B-cell
lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins [9]. Life or death
of a cancer cell relies on the levels of each Bcl-2 family
member [10]. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, such
as BAX, BAK, BAD, BIM, BID, NOXA and PUMA,
facilitate death through several mechanisms, including
direct activation of BAX or antagonization of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins share a conserved dimerization motif
called Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) and stood model for
small-molecule inhibitors such as ABT263, which
were molecularly engineered to target anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w,
but  not Mcl-1. These so-called BH-3 mimetics have
been successfully applied in early stage clinical trials
for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies or smallcell lung cancer [11–14]. The major drawback of ABTcompounds is represented by the inability to bind and
interfere with Mcl-1 function. Consequently, high levels
of Mcl-1 are causal for resistance against ABT737,
ABT263 and ABT199.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis whether
TIC10/ONC201 sensitizes for inhibition of Bcl-2/BclxL through BH3-mimetics. Our data show that TIC10/
ONC201, when combined with BH3-mimetics, yields
a synergistic anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect
in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner across different
glioblastoma cells. Moreover, in vivo, combined
treatment with TIC10/ONC201 and the BH-3 mimetic
ABT263 results in a significant enhancement of tumor
growth inhibition in a heterotopic glioblastoma model.
From a mechanistic point of view, we identified downregulation of Usp9X as well as Bag3 followed by
enhanced Mcl-1-degradation as one of the driving
mechanisms subjacent to the profound anti-cancer
activity inherent to a combined inhibition of ERK
signaling and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL.

TIC10/ONC201 along with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL
inhibition yields a synergistic anti-proliferative
effect
In order to examine whether TIC10/ONC201 along
with inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL results in a mutually
enhanced anti-proliferative effect, we performed MTT
assays in pediatric (SF188), adult (T98G) and proneural
(MGPP-3 - derived from a transgenic mouse model)
glioblastoma cells. As shown in Figure 1A, we first
determined the median effective dose (ED50) for the
BH-3 mimetic ABT263 and the dual AKT/ERK inhibitor
TIC10/ONC201 (Figure 1D) in all three cell lines. Next,
we examined how the combined treatment with both
compounds affects the proliferation of glioblastoma
cells when compared to single-agent treatments. The
dose-effect relationship for the combination of both
agents was calculated based on the Chou-Talalay method
generating normalized isobolograms (Figure 1B) and
combination indices (Table 1). Our data show that
treatment with ABT263 and TIC10/ONC201 results in
a synergistic anti-proliferative effect (Figure 1B). These
findings are illustrated by representative microscopic
images of SF188 and MGPP-3 glioblastoma cells
showing a marked reduction in cellular density for those
cells subjected to the combination treatment (Figure 1C).

The combination treatment of TIC10/ONC201
and ABT263 enhances apoptosis and
caspase-activation
We next assessed whether the synergistic antiproliferative effect of ABT263 and TIC10/ONC201 is
related to enhanced induction of apoptosis. Therefore,
staining for propidium iodide was performed prior to
flowcytometric analysis. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B,
combined treatment with ABT263 and TIC10/ONC201
results in a statistically significant increase in the fraction
of sub-G1 cells (apoptotic cells). In addition, we performed
staining for annexin V/PI as an independent second and more
apoptosis-specific method (Figure 2C–2F, Supplementary
Figure 1). Combined treatment with ABT263 and TIC10/
ONC201 results in a marked increase in the fraction of
annexin V-positive (apoptotic) SF188 (pediatric - C),
T98G (adult - D), MGPP-3 (transgenic proneural - E)
and NCH644 (glioma stem-like - F) as well as NCH421K
(glioma stem-like - Supplementary Figure 1) glioblastoma
cells. In concordance with these findings, our data show
enhanced cleavage of caspases 9, 3 and PARP following
treatment with the combination of TIC10/ONC201 and
ABT263 providing additional proof for enhanced induction
of apoptosis due to this treatment on the molecular level
(Figure 2G and 2H).

Combined treatment with TIC10/ONC201 and
ABT263 results in down-regulation of ERK
signaling in glioblastoma

ABT263, we decided to further elucidate the subjacent
molecular mechanism by putting the spotlight onto
the mitochondrial pathway. Bcl-2 family proteins
are important regulators of this pathway and its antiapoptotic members are known mediators of apoptosis
resistance. Expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family member Mcl-1 represents one of the best
described mechanisms of resistance towards ABTcompounds. As shown in Figure 3B and Supplementary
Figure 2, treatment with ABT263 resulted in an early
up-regulation of Mcl-1. In contrast, treatment with
TIC10/ONC201 yielded a suppression of Mcl-1 which
was maintained in the combination treatment. Western
blot analyses of other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, showed inconsistent results.
However, in both, SF188 and MGPP-3 glioblastoma
cells Bcl-xL levels were depleted when cells were
treated with the combination treatment. Moreover, in
MGPP-3, combined treatment with both compounds
resulted in a significant reduction in Bcl-2 expression.

Previous data showed that treatment with TIC10/
ONC201 resulted in dual inhibition of ERK and AKT [4]. To
examine whether this finding holds also true for the setting
of glioblastoma and furthermore, how it may be affected
by an additional treatment with a BH3-mimetic, Western
blot analyses were performed (Figure 3A). Our data show
that combined treatment with both compounds results in an
earlier and more pronounced dephosphorylation of ERK
when compared to treatment with TIC10/ONC201 alone.
Interestingly, pAKT levels were enhanced upon treatment
with the combination which was in contrast to total AKT
levels showing a decrease in expression after 24 h and 72 h
of treatment with both compounds. Dephosphorylation of
Foxo3a is a known downstream effect of dual inhibition of
ERK and AKT. Despite a lack of a significant decrease in the
expression of pAKT after treatment with TIC10/ONC201
alone or in combination with ABT263, expression of the
phosphorylated form of Foxo3a was drastically reduced
and more pronounced following a treatment with the
combination. Protein expression levels of Bcl-2-like protein
11 (BIM), a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member regulated
by Foxo3a, showed an early increase and at later time points
a marked decrease.

Treatment with TIC10/ONC201 and concomitant
inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL depletes the Mcl-1
chaperone Bag3 and the deubiquitinase Usp9X
To further dissect by which means Mcl-1 expression
is mechanistically affected we performed Western blot
analyses for Bag3 and Usp9X - two molecules that are
known to affect the stability of Mcl-1. Both, Bag3 and
Usp9X expression levels were significantly decreased
when cells received treatment with TIC10/ONC201 alone
suggesting that the inhibitory effect of TIC10/ONC201 on
Mcl-1 is at least partly mediated through an inhibition of
Bag3 and Usp9X (Figure 3B, Supplementary Figure 2).

combination of both agents Mcl-1 and Bag3 mRNA levels
were increased across all three  time points. For  Usp9X,
mRNA levels were not decreased at early time points
following single-agent treatments but at 48  h they were
reduced to approximately 50–60% of control (Figure 4C).
Combined treatment with both compounds resulted in
an increase in mRNA levels for Usp9X except after 48 h
where a 50% decrease was noted which however, did not
exceed the decrease in Usp9X mRNA levels observed after
treatment with ABT263 alone. Moreover, when blocking
protein synthesis by treatment with cycloheximide, a marked
reduction in protein stability was found for Mcl-1 when cells
were treated with TIC10/ONC201 (Figure 4D). In addition,
inhibition of proteasomal degradation by treatment with
MG132 resulted in a significant restoration of Mcl-1 protein

mediated but due to enhanced proteasomal

and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization are
hallmarks of apoptosis induction through the intrinsic
pathway. To assess whether the presence of BAX and
BAK are necessary for the synergistic pro-apoptotic
effect exerted by a combined treatment with TIC10/
ONC201 and ABT263, we performed knock-down
experiments silencing both BAX and BAK simultaneously
(Figure 5E and 5F). As shown in Figure 5E, combined
knock-down of BAX and BAK yielded a nearly complete
prevention of apoptosis which stresses the importance of
the intrinsic pathway as the mechanistic route responsible
for the pro-apoptotic synergism of the combination
treatment.

Noxa but not BIM is required for the efficient
cell death induction by the combination
treatment of TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263
Given that Mcl-1 was significantly down-regulated by
TIC10/ONC201 and the combination of ABT263 and TIC10/
ONC201, we next examined whether the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
family members Noxa and BIM, which interact with Mcl-1,
are required for cell death induction by the combination
treatment. Therefore, we conducted immunoprecipitation
studies to assess if the interaction of Noxa and BIM with
Mcl-1 is regulated by the various treatments. Treatment
with ABT263 alone and the combination of TIC10/
ONC201 and ABT263 enhanced the association of Noxa
with Mcl-1 (Figure 4F). The BIM – Mcl-1 interaction was
mildly enhanced by the combination treatment. These results
suggest that Noxa and BIM are potentially implicated in
TIC10/ONC201/ABT263-mediated cell death. To further
test this hypothesis we performed knock-down experiments
for both BIM and Noxa (Figure 4G and 4H). While BIM
silencing did not rescue the effect of the combination
treatment, Noxa knock-down almost completely abrogated
the pro-apoptotic effect of the combination treatment.

The pro-apoptotic synergism of TIC10/ONC201
and ABT263 is independent of extrinsic pathway
activation
It has been previously shown that treatment with
TIC10/ONC201 yields an enhanced transcriptional
activity for TRAIL in cancer cells which in turn has
been postulated to be responsible for part of the antineoplastic activity attributed to this compound [4]. We
therefore examined whether activation of the extrinsic
pathway contributes to the pro-apoptotic synergism of
the combination treatment. T98G glioblastoma cells
treated with siRNA against DR5, the main death receptor
for TRAIL in glioblastoma, showed no significant
attenuation of apoptosis induced by a combined
treatment with ABT263 and TIC10/ONC201 when
compared to cells not silenced for DR5 (Supplementary
Figure 3A and 3B). Moreover, treatment with caspase
8-siRNA (Supplementary Figure 3A and 3C) or the
caspase 8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK (Supplementary
Figure 3D) did not provide a protection against the proapoptotic effect of the combination treatment.

Silencing of Mcl-1, Bag3 or Usp9X are sufficient
to sensitize GBM cells to ABT263-mediated
apoptosis
In order to examine whether the biological effects of
the combination treatment can be mimicked by a different
means we performed siRNA experiments based on the
observations we made on the molecular level. As shown in
Figure 5A, knock-down of Mcl-1 alone resulted in a slight
increase in the fraction of sub-G1 cells. However, when cells
were treated in addition with ABT263 a significant additional
increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells was noted.
Similarly, knock-down of the Mcl-1 chaperone Bag3 or the
deubiquitinase Usp9X, both known to stabilize Mcl-1, lead
to a marked increase in the fraction of sub-G1 cells when
combined with ABT263 (Figure 5B and 5C). Consistently,
siRNA-mediated knock-down of either Usp9X or Bag3
resulted in a concomitant suppression of Mcl-1 protein levels
(Figure 5D). These findings are also in concordance with
the notion that the protein stability of Mcl-1 is reduced upon
TIC10/ONC201 treatment (see Figure 4).

Treatment with TIC10/ONC201 enhances the
anti-cancer activity of ABT263 in vivo
To assess the therapeutic efficacy of this combination
therapy in vivo, 5 × 105 PDGF+, PTEN−/−, p53−/−,
luciferase+ (MGPP-3) glioblastoma cells that were derived
from a proneural transgenic mouse model were implanted
subcutaneously as a 1:1 suspension in matrigel. Once
tumors formed, the mice were randomized and treated
with ABT263 (25 mg/kg), TIC10/ONC201 (25  mg/kg),
both agents or solvent. Under these conditions, animals
that received the combination treatment had statistically
significantly smaller tumors than animals treated with
vehicle, ABT263 or TIC10/ONC201 alone (Figure 6A–6C).
Remarkably, animals treated with the drug combination
showed a 46.1% tumor regression, indicating that the
combination therapy did not only affect tumor proliferation
but also impacted tumor cell death in vivo (Figure 6A).
This notion is reinforced by the fact that histological

through a Foxo3a-dependent mechanism [4]. This finding
is considered a “breakthrough” since before its discovery
extrinsic apoptosis induction was entirely centered on
death-receptor agonistic antibodies, such as lexatumumab,
or on genetically engineered recombinant human TRAIL
(AA: 114–281). For our study, we decided to use the
angular form of TIC10 since this form was shown to
have TRAIL-inducing capacity [20]. In order to target
the intrinsic apoptotic pathway we utilized a novel orally
available BH3-mimetic, Navitoclax also designated as
ABT263. Tagscherer et al. have initially proposed that
inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL through ABT-compounds is a
worthwhile strategy for the treatment of glial tumors [21].
More recently, the group led by Dent and colleagues has
shown that the BH3-mimetic GX15-070 (Obatoclax) may
be active in drug combination therapies in an orthotopic
model of glioblastoma [22] and suggested that GX15-070
may be capable of crossing the blood-brain-barrier. In line
with our initial hypothesis the drug combination of TIC10/
ONC201 and ABT263 elicited strong synergistic cell death
induction in adult and pediatric established GBM cells as
well as in stem cell-like glioma cells.
Mechanistically, TIC10/ONC201 leads to a
significant reduction in Mcl-1 protein levels along with
its interacting proteins, Usp9X [23] and Bag3 [24].
Given the impact of Usp9X on the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and the reduction of
Usp9X by TIC10/ON201 or the combination treatment it
is anticipated that the decline of Usp9X further facilitates
the cell death induction mediated by the combination
therapy. TIC10/ONC201-mediated reduction in Mcl-1
levels occurred in a posttranslational manner as protein
stability of Mcl-1 was reduced upon TIC10/ONC201
treatment. This posttranslational reduction of Mcl-1 by
TIC10/ONC201 may be related to its inhibitory effect
on ERK since ERK was shown to phosphorylate Mcl-1
at Threonine 163 and thereby to regulate its turnover
[25]. In the present literature numerous groups, including
ours, have identified Mcl-1 as a key factor of resistance to
BH3-mimetics [26–32]. This is explained by the notion
that ABT-compounds mostly interfere with the function
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, while they have essentially no effect
on Mcl-1 [33, 34]. Moreover, ABT263 and ABT737 have
been reported to even increase the levels of Mcl-1 thereby
driving paradoxical resistance. Therefore, strategies to
interfere with Mcl-1 are currently explored such as the
design of novel compounds that bind to Mcl-1 [30] or
the discovery of molecules that suppress Mcl-1 levels
in cancer cells [35]. While drug-mediated suppression
of Mcl-1 levels in cancer cells takes place at multiple
instances, commonly this involves reduction of protein
stability of Mcl-1. However, other molecules have been
shown to suppress Mcl-1 at the level of transcription as
well as translation, such as mTORC1/2 inhibitors through
modulation of 4EBP1. Moreover, TIC10/ONC201
caused a down-regulation of the Hsp70 co-chaperone

DISCUSSION
Glioblastoma remains to be a major therapeutic
challenge. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity is characterized
by an activation of several oncogenic tumor driver
pathways in different cells within the same tumor and
represents one of the major obstacles for a therapeutic
success in glioblastoma. While certain malignancies, such
as chronic myeloid leukemia, have shown response to a
single-agent treatment, this seems unlikely in the setting
of glioblastoma given the implications described above.
Therefore, alternative strategies are necessary. One key
strategy would be to target multiple deregulated pathways
by drug combination therapies. The effects of each
compound may be remarkably enhanced when combining
even just two drugs - ideally in a synergistic manner and
without increasing side effects.
Here, we identified a novel drug combination that
has not been described in any tumor entity thus far. Alike
other tumor entities, glioblastoma displays a remarkable
resistance against programmed cell death. There are
different reasons why tumors acquire resistance towards
apoptosis. The activation of multiple oncogenic pathways
certainly contributes to this phenomenon. Consequently,
drug combinations that simultaneously target these
different pathways may represent a welcome contribution
to the treatment battery for malignant brain tumors.
Our initial hypothesis was that dual targeting of
the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways might be a
powerful approach to combat these tumors. In the past,
enthusiasm about this strategy was largely dampened by
the fact that inducers of extrinsic apoptosis bear highly
unfavorable pharmacokinetics (recombinant human
TRAIL) or in some cases even severe side effects, such
as hepatotoxicity (FasL) [15]. Still, death ligands, such as
TRAIL, demonstrated significant anti-glioma activity in
several preclinical models of malignant glioma [16–18].
Moreover, it is notable that TRAIL-mediated apoptosis can
be enhanced by various means, suggesting that TRAILbased therapies are particularly effective in combination
therapies. In most instances, combination therapies are
studied in the setting of two drug compounds, but it
may be worthwhile in the future to even combine more
than two treatment modalities in order to elicit the most
pronounced inhibition on tumor growth [19].

compound that induces TRAIL at the level of transcription

Bag3, which has been reported to mediate resistance to
BH3-mimetics in glioblastoma by regulating Mcl-1 levels.
Consistently, siRNA-mediated knock-down of Bag3
significantly reduced Mcl-1 levels and sensitized T98G
glioblastoma cells to ABT263. Earlier Bag3 was suggested
as a therapeutic target for GBM [36].
Yet, knock-down of Bag3 only marginally induces
cell death and from our own observation it appears that
Mcl-1-dependent cell lines are particularly susceptible
to Bag3 withdrawal. Regardless of Mcl-1-dependency
specific knock-down of Bag3 sensitizes cancer cells to
the cytotoxic effects of ABT263 and ABT737, suggesting
that interference with Bag3 may be useful to chemosensitization.
In addition, we found that the combination treatment
of TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263 regulated the expression
levels of the deubiquitinase Usp9X. Previous data from
others and our own group indicated that Usp9X plays
a role in the regulation of Mcl-1 and consequently
determines susceptibility of cancer cells to the sensitivity
of BH3-mimetics [23, 28, 37–39].
Our data confirms the previous notion that knocking
down Usp9X suppresses Mcl-1 along with Bcl-2 and
primes glioblastoma cells to ABT263. Usp9X remains an
interesting target as its levels are increased in glioblastoma
and this molecule maintains high levels of certain antiapoptotic factors, such as Mcl-1, Inhibitor of Apoptosis
Proteins and a gene fusion observed in 40% of prostatic
carcinomas [40].
With respect to pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members,
it is known that BIM is sequestered by Mcl-1, leading to
interference with its cell death inducing properties [41].
Therefore, down-regulation of Mcl-1 leads to liberation
of BIM that in turn is either sequestered by Bcl-xL or
engages directly in intrinsic apoptosis through binding
and activation of the pro-apoptotic effector BAX [42, 43].
Moreover, inhibition of MEK has been shown to enhance
BIM expression [41]. However, in our model system we
appreciated only an early settle increase in BIM levels.
Given that TIC10/ONC201 had a major impact on Mcl-1
levels this will likely result in an increase of unbound
BIM. Another pro-apoptotic molecule is Noxa which
is encoded by the PMAIP1 gene. Noxa has been shown
to negatively regulate Mcl-1 and when up-regulated to
promote sensitivity to ABT compounds [44–47]. Factors
that lead to an increase of Noxa often activate p53 or
induce a stress response. TIC10/ONC201 did not regulate
the expression of Noxa, but we saw a modulation of
Noxa through ABT263. Therefore, we assessed whether
specific suppression of Noxa may interfere with ABT263/
TIC10/ONC201-mediated cell death. Our data show
that Noxa is a major effector of this drug combination.
We also tested whether the binding of BIM and Noxa to
Mcl-1 is influenced by TIC10/ONC201, ABT263 or the
combination of both. Under our conditions, we did not find
an enhanced release of BIM from Mcl-1. Although there
was no increased binding of Noxa to Mcl-1 in cells treated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with TIC10/ONC201 alone, the combination treatment led
to an increased association of Noxa and Mcl-1. Notably,
the fact that BIM is not primarily involved in cell death
mediated by ABT263 and TIC10/ONC201 may be also
cell line-dependent. In addition, the requirement for BIM
to induce cell death may be also related to the particular
drug combination tested as certain reagents may depend
more on the presence of BIM than others.
Since TIC10/ONC201 was reported to induce
TRAIL and mediate extrinsic apoptosis we assessed
[4–7] whether interference with caspase 8 and DR5 by
specific siRNAs would attenuate death induced by the
combination therapy of ABT263 and TIC10/ONC201.
To our surprise, the combination therapy was neither
dependent on caspase 8 nor on DR5. Moreover, the
combination treatment was also active in NCH421K
cells, which express very low levels of caspase 8 [48].
These results indicate that the combination of TIC10/
ONC201 and ABT263 may have anti-glioma activity
against tumors with absent or low levels of caspase 8.
However, the observation that the combination treatment
of TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263 does not depend on
the presence of caspase 8 may be attributed to the fact
that relatively low concentrations of TIC10/ONC201
were used which may not suffice to mediate a strong
TRAIL induction. Another explanation may be that
these observations are cell line-dependent and certain
cell types may require less TIC10/ONC201 to elicit
an extrinsic apoptotic response. Thus, Mcl-1 which
sequesters a significant pool of BAK in cancer cells
seems to be the major determinant for the sensitization
of TIC10/ONC201 to ABT263-mediated apoptosis. In
line with that assumption is our finding that the drug
combination of TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263 induces
apoptosis in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner since
knock-down of BAX/BAK significantly abrogated cell
death by the combination therapy in T98G glioblastoma
cells.
An earlier study suggested that the drug
combination of TRAIL and ABT737 might be
efficient for the treatment of glioblastoma [49]. From
a mechanistic point of view, combined treatment with
TRAIL and ABT737 elicited BAX- as well as BIDdependent apoptosis since TRAIL was shown to activate
caspase 8, leading to cleavage of BID to tBID and
thereby to the activation and enhancement of intrinsic
apoptosis induced by ABT737. Since in our setting, the
effects of the combination treatment did not depend on
caspase 8, we did not consider tBID as a major factor in
TIC10/ONC201/ABT263-mediated apoptosis. Overall,
these results reinforce the notion that down-regulation of
Mcl-1 is the driving force for the sensitization of TIC10/
ONC201 to ABT-compounds. However, we cannot
exclude that under other conditions or in other model
systems the extrinsic apoptotic pathway may contribute
to the facilitation of ABT263-mediated apoptosis in the
presence of TIC10/ONC201.

Finally, we examined whether the drug combination
of TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263 is also effective in vivo.
We therefore utilized a heterotopic proneural transgenic
glioblastoma model. In this model, the drug combination
led to a tumor regression, while the single and vehicle
treatments did not cause a significant growth reduction.
Notably, the drug combination did not cause any organ
toxicity, suggesting that the treatment is feasible and
may have little to no side effects. At this point, it has
not entirely unraveled whether gliomas of proneural
subtype are particularly prone or resistant to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL
inhibition. This is currently being under investigation.
Nevertheless, proneural gliomas encompass a significant
amount of gliomas which also include lower-grade
gliomas and secondary glioblastomas. Overall, these
observations confirm that drug combination therapies,
involving Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition, are potentially feasible
for the treatment of glioblastoma.
