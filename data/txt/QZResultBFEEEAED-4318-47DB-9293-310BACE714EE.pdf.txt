Abstract
Deregulation of the mTOR pathway is closely associated with tumorigenesis. Accordingly, mTOR inhibitors
such as rapamycin and mTOR-selective kinase inhibitors have been tested as cancer therapeutic agents.
Inhibition of mTOR results in sensitization to DNA-damaging agents; however, the molecular mechanism is
not well understood. We found that an mTOR-selective kinase inhibitor, AZD8055, signiﬁcantly enhanced
sensitivity of a pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma xenograft to radiotherapy and sensitized rhabdomyosarcoma cells
to the DNA interstrand cross-linker (ICL) melphalan. Sensitization correlated with drug-induced downregulation
of a key component of the Fanconi anemia pathway, FANCD2 through mTOR regulation of FANCD2 gene
transcripts via mTORC1-S6K1. Importantly, we show that FANCD2 is required for the proper activation of
ATM-Chk2 checkpoint in response to ICL and that mTOR signaling promotes ICL-induced ATM-Chk2
checkpoint activation by sustaining FANCD2. In FANCD2-deﬁcient lymphoblasts, FANCD2 is essential to
suppress endogenous and induced DNA damage, and FANCD2-deﬁcient cells showed impaired ATM-Chk2 and
ATR-Chk1 activation, which was rescued by reintroduction of wild-type FANCD2. Pharmacologic inhibition of
PI3K–mTOR–AKT pathway in Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells attenuated ICL-induced activation of ATM,
accompanied with the decrease of FANCD2. These data suggest that the mTOR pathway may promote the
repair of DNA double-strand breaks by sustaining FANCD2 and provide a novel mechanism of how the Fanconi
anemia pathway modulates DNA damage response and repair. Cancer Res; 73(11); 3393–401. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Recent data have shown that cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDK) are required for the processing of damaged DNA ends
and checkpoint activation (1–3), but the molecular mechanism
by which CDKs act is unknown. PI3K–AKT and RAS–MAPK are
the predominant growth-promoting signaling pathways,
which enhance CDK activity and increase cell-cycle progression. Cancer genome projects showed that PI3K–AKT and
RAS–MAPK are among the most frequently mutated signaling
pathways in cancers (4), and both pathways converge on
mTOR signaling (5). mTOR lies at the hub of intracellular and
extracellular signal transduction networks via integrating and
processing multiple signals, and dictates the rates of macromolecule synthesis and hence cell growth, proliferation, and

survival (6–8). Aberrant activity of mTOR signaling has been
found in most cancers, making mTOR an important target for
cancer drug development (7, 9, 10). We previously found that
the TOR pathway promotes cell survival at the cost of elevated
mutation rate in response to DNA replication stress and DNA
damage in yeast (11). Data also show that inhibiting the mTOR
pathway sensitizes many cancer cells to chemotherapy and
radiotherapy; however, the molecular mechanism by which
this occurs is largely unclear (12–14).
These observations suggest that mTOR signaling maintains
some components of the DNA damage response (DDR) and
repair response. Besides homologous recombination, most if
not all DNA repair systems are error prone and the major
function of DNA damage checkpoint and repair systems is to
maximize cell survival. It was intriguing, therefore, to test
whether mTOR signaling modulates DDR and enhances DNA
damage repair in cancer cells.
In this study, using pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma models in
vitro and in vivo, we have investigated the functional linkage
between the mTOR pathway and DDR, and found that mTOR
signaling sustains FANCD2-mediated signaling pathways to
promote DDR via potentiating the ATM checkpoint activation
in response DNA double-strand breaks (DSB).

Results
An mTOR kinase inhibitor sensitizes cancer cells to
radiotherapy and chemotherapy
Several mTOR-selective kinase inhibitors have recently been
reported that in comparison with rapalogs, abrogate mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1)-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1
(15, 16). We previously showed that AZD8055 is a potent and
speciﬁc mTOR kinase inhibitor (17). To test the involvement of
mTOR in DDR, we examined the effect of AZD8055 on ionizing
radiation using the Rh30 xenograft model. Mice were irradiated
(2 Gy/tumor day) using whole body shielding to a range of total
doses (from 10–40 Gy) with or without AZD8055 at various
starting volumes. In the radiation alone group, radiation
treatment induced tumor volume regressions, but tumors
regrew and progressed in 14 of the 18 mice (78% failure rate)
with a radiation dose per volume of tumor of 60 Gy/cm3. In
contrast, only in 4 of the 15 mice did tumors regrow in the
combination XRT-AZD8055 treatment arm (Table 1) with dose

Regulation of FANCD2 by mTOR

per volume of 27 Gy/cm3; a more than 50% reduction in
radiation dose with a similar reduction in failure rate. In Rh30
xenografts, AZD8055 has limited single-agent activity, slowing
tumor progression, but does not induce either stable disease or
tumor regression (17). Thus, this mTOR kinase inhibitor may
be a promising radiosensitizer.
We previously reported that rapamycin enhanced the activity of the bifunctional alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide,
against several pediatric tumor models (18). To extend this
observation in vitro, we checked whether AZD8055 sensitizes
cultured Rh30 cells to DNA interstrand cross-linker (ICL)
melphalan, which produces DNA DSB. We pretreated Rh30
cells with AZD8055 for 16 hours, and transiently exposed the
cells to melphalan for 2 hours. Drugs were washed away, and
survival was assayed by colony formation. AZD8055 or transient insult with melphalan resulted in 16% and 18% loss of cell
viability, respectively. Pretreatment with AZD8055 followed by
transient melphalan exposure led to a signiﬁcant decrease in
colony formation (66%; Fig. 1A and B). Thus, targeting mTOR
kinase sensitizes cancer cells to ICL-based chemotherapies.
The mTOR pathway controls FANCD2
The above data suggest that mTOR signaling plays an
important role for cancer cells to survive DSB-producing
agents. This may be not due to the decrease of ATM, ATR
and DNA-PKcs, as AZD8055 did not alter the protein levels of

ATR, RAD51, and DNA-PKcs but slightly increased ATM (Fig.
1C). Of note, exposure to AZD8055 resulted in marked decrease
in FANCD2, but not other components of the Fanconi anemia
pathway (FANCC, FANCA). Fanconi anemia pathway-deﬁcient
cells display phosphorylation of H2AX, a marker of DNA strand
breaks, and defect of DNA damage checkpoint in response to
DNA damage (19, 20). Fanconi anemia cells, such as FANCD2deﬁcient PD20 lymphoblast cells, display high levels of gH2AX,
and reexpression of FANCD2 in PD20 cells reduced gH2AX
levels (Fig. 1D; refs. 19, 20). Similarly, knockdown of FANCD2 by
siRNA led to increased gH2AX in Rh30 cells (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, AZD8055 downregulated FANCD2 and induced
gH2AX, whereas ectopic overexpression of FANCD2 partially
attenuated AZD8055-induced gH2AX (Fig. 1F). These results
led us to hypothesize that mTOR signaling may regulate DDR
and hence DSB repair by controlling FANCD2 signaling.
AZD8055 treatment reduced the levels of FANCD2 in a
time-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similarly,
knockdown of mTOR by siRNA decreased FANCD2 (Fig. 1G). In
contrast to melphalan that causes ICL, inhibition of mTOR
signaling did not result in the monoubiquitination of FANCD2
in Rh30 cells (Fig. 1H). In addition, overexpression of wild-type
AKT1 (Supplementary Fig. S1B) or myristoylated AKT1 (myrAKT1; Supplementary Fig. S1C) in Rh30 cells increased
FANCD2 and was associated with enhanced activity of the
AKT pathway as shown by the elevation of the pGSK3b-S9

signal. These data showed that AKT–mTOR signaling controls
the levels of FANCD2. To test this further, we treated cultured
rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells with mTORC1-speciﬁc inhibitor rapamycin, AZD8055 and AKT kinase inhibitor MK2206
(21). Rapamycin inhibited the phosphorylation of pS6K1
(T389), a marker of mTORC1 activity, but increased the phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 due to the mTORC1-S6K1-IRS–
negative feedback loop (22). Treatment with either AZD8055 or
MK2206 resulted in absence of the phosphorylation of both
pS6K1 (T389) and pAKT (S473), indicating inhibition of both
mTORC1 and mTORC2. Similar to AZD8055, MK2006 reduced
FANCD2 although the effect of rapamycin was less pronounced
(Supplementary Fig. S1D), showing that AKT–mTOR pathway
controls FANCD2.
Our data suggest that mTOR signaling may be involved in
the DDR and repair of DSB by regulating the Fanconi anemia
signaling pathway. To test this in vivo, we next checked
FANCD2 protein levels of the mouse xenografts of Rh18, Rh30,
and Rh10 following treatment with AZD8055. Mice received
AZD8055 daily for 4 days, and tumors were harvested 1, 4, 8, and
24 hours after the ﬁnal dose. AZD8055 efﬁciently and rapidly
inhibited both the mTORC1 and mTORC2, as shown by the
decrease of p4E-BP1-T37/46, pS6-S235/6, and pAKT-S473 signals 1 hour after treatment (Fig. 2A and B). At 24 hours after
AZD8055 dosing, FANCD2 was markedly reduced in all of the 3
tumor models (Fig. 2C). As AZD8055 inhibits both mTORC1
and mTORC2, we additionally checked the FANCD2 of the
mouse tumor xenografts Rh30 and Rh18 treated with rapamycin. Similar to AZD8055, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin resulted in apparent downregulation of FANCD2 in vivo
(Fig. 2D). These in vivo and in vitro data suggest that FANCD2 is
regulated by the mTORC1 pathway.
mTORC1-S6K1 signaling controls transcription of
FANCD2
The above results showed that inhibition of mTORC1 led to
decreased FANCD2 both in tumor xenografts and cultured
cells. As TOR signaling has been implicated in both translation and transcription, we probed the mechanism by which
this pathway regulates FANCD2 levels. We determined the
mRNA levels of FANCD2 following inhibition of mTOR signaling by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).
Treatment of Rh30 cells with AZD8055 resulted in a progressive decrease in FANCD2 mRNA (Fig. 3A). Similarly, rapamycin and MK2206 also decreased FANCD2 mRNA (Fig. 3B).
Conversely, overexpression of AKT1 increased the mRNA of
FANCD2 (Fig. 3C). Thus mTOR signaling seems to regulate
either transcription or transcript stability of FANCD2 gene.
From yeast to mammalian cells, the TOR pathway promotes
cell-cycle progression by increasing the activity of CDKs (8).
Indeed, AZD8055 robustly reduced both total and pRb-S780
(Fig. 3D). Recently, an essential role for CDKs in processing of
damaged DNA ends and checkpoint activation has been
described (1). Our data show that mTOR coordinately controls
the proteins and mRNAs of FANCD2. These observations
suggest that mTOR controls the gene expression of FANCD2
by regulating CDKs. To further test this observation, we treated
Rh30 cells with rapamycin, AZD8055 or MK2206, in parallel

determined FANCD2 by immunoblotting. Similar to AZD8055
and MK2206, PD0332991 signiﬁcantly reduced FANCD2 (Fig.
3E). We further analyzed the FANCD2 mRNAs of Rh30 cells
treated with PD0332991. Consistent with the decreased protein
levels, PD0332991 reduced FANCD2 mRNAs (Fig. 3F), showing
that the gene transcription/transcript stability of FANCD2 is
indirectly controlled by CDKs. We next reduced CDK4 and
CDK6 by siRNAs in Rh30 cells. Knockdown of CDK4 led to
reduction of both FANCD2 protein (Supplementary Fig. S2A)
and mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Interestingly, downregulation of CDK6 by siRNA increased both the protein and
mRNA levels of FANCD2, accompanied by an enhanced pRbS780 signal (Supplementary Fig. S2A). These data showed that
FANCD2 is positively controlled by CDK4, which is consistent
with the ﬁnding that FANCD2 is regulated by Rb-E2F1 (25).
We further tested whether FANCD2 mRNA is controlled by
mTORC1 signaling, by examining whether S6K1 knock out
MEF cells (S6K1/ MEF). S6K1/ MEFs showed signiﬁcant
downregulation of FANCD2 protein (Fig. 3G) and mRNA (Fig.

principally via the mTORC1–S6K1 pathway.
FANCD2 is required for the activation of both ATM-Chk2
and ATR-Chk1 checkpoints
It was recently reported that FANCD2 mediates the nucleolytic incisions near the ICL and leads to DNA DSB (26, 27),
which may result in ATM-Chk2 activation and phosphorylation of H2AX. This model suggests that FANCD2 may be
essential for ATM-Chk2 activation in the early steps of Fanconi
anemia signaling-mediated repair of ICL-induced DNA lesions.
To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst compared the status of ATRChk1 and ATM-Chk2 activation of the lymphoblast PD20 cells
derived from a patient with mutant FANCD2 and the isogenic
PD20 cells reintroduced with wild-type FANCD2 by immunoblotting. Similar to previous ﬁndings (28, 29), FANCD2-deﬁcient PD20 cells showed high levels of gH2AX, an indication of
DNA strand breaks, whereas reintroduction of wild-type

www.aacrjournals.org

FANCD2 into PD20 cells suppressed gH2AX signal (see Fig.
1D). Reintroduction of wild-type FANCD2 into PD20 cells led to
an increase of pChk1-S345, and a slight increase in pChk2-T68
but not pATM-S1981 signals, indicating the activation of ATRChk1 checkpoint (Fig. 4A). As the central function of ATR-Chk1
is to promote DNA damage repair (30), these data suggest that
FANCD2 functions to enhance ATR-Chk1 checkpoint and
suppress spontaneous DNA damage under normal growth
conditions.
FANCD2 is required for repair of ICL-induced DNA damage
and intra-S phase checkpoint activation. To test whether
FANCD2 is required for intra-S-phase checkpoint activation,
we examined ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 activation in response
to hydroxyurea in PD20 cells and the PD20 cells reintroduced
with wild-type FANCD2 by immunoblotting. Hydroxyureatreated PD20 cells displayed decreased pChk1-S345, pATMS1981, and pChk2-T68 signals compared with those of PD20
with FANCD2 reintroduced (Fig. 4B). We additionally tested

shown by the signiﬁcant low levels of pChk1-S345, pATMS1981, and pChk2-T68 signals compared with those of PD20expressing wild-type FANCD2 (Fig. 4C), these data show that
FANCD2 is required for the full activation of both DNA
replication and damage checkpoints under normal growth
conditions and in response to genotoxins.
The mTOR pathway is essential for proper ATM-Chk2
checkpoint activation in response to ICL
The model that FANCD2-mediated nucleolytic incision
near the ICL results in DNA DSB (26, 27) also predicts that
activation of ATR-Chk1 precedes the activation of ATM-Chk2.
To explore this model, we treated Rh30 cells with melphalan for
a different timepoint and monitored the dynamics of gH2AX
and pChk1-S345 signals. Chk1 was activated in 1 hour and
reached its full activation 2 hours following melphalan treatment. In contrast, phosphorylation of H2AX displayed a signiﬁcant delay (Fig. 5A), which correlated with PARP1 cleavage.
Similar to the delayed phosphorylation of H2AX, ATM also
showed delayed phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). We next knocked
down FANCD2 in Rh30 cells by siRNA, transiently insulted with
different concentrations of melphalan, and detected the
gH2AX and pChk1-S345 signals by immunoblotting. Downregulation of FANCD2 by siRNA did not effect the activation of
Chk1, but apparently attenuated the phosphorylation of H2AX
by melphalan (Fig. 5C). We further examined gH2AX by
immunocytochemistry of Rh30 treated with FANCD2 siRNA
plus melphalan or AZD8055 plus melphalan. Both AZD8055
and FANCD2 siRNA reduced the phosphorylation of H2AX
induced by melphalan (Fig. 5D). These results showed that
during the early response to ICL, FANCD2 is required for the

3398

proper phosphorylation of H2AX and hence activation of ATM,
but not essential for ATR-Chk1 activation, providing evidence
for the proposed model of the function of FANCD2 in response
to ICL (26, 27).
Our observations, that FANCD2 is required for the timely
ATM-Chk2 checkpoint activation in response to ICL and
FANCD2 is controlled by mTOR signaling, suggest that the
mTOR pathway is essential for the timely activation of ATMChk2 checkpoint in response to ICL. To test this, we treated
PD20 cells with AZD8055 for 16 hours, followed by addition of
melphalan for 5 hours. Although FANCD2-deﬁcient PD20 cells
displayed impaired Chk2 activation in response to melphalan
(Fig. 4C), PD20 cells rescued by wild-type FANCD2 showed
robust Chk2 activation, which was abolished by AZD8055
accompanied with reduction of FANCD2 protein (Fig. 6A).
Similarly, in Rh30 cells, melphalan-induced pATM-S1981 signals were reduced by either AZD8055 or MK2206, accompanied
with downregulation of FANCD2 (Fig. 6B). In addition to
melphalan, AZD8055 also abolished the activation of Chk2 by
mitomycin C (Fig. 6C). This reduction seems independent of
the proteasome pathway because MG132 did not affect
AZD8055-induced reduction of FANCD2 and melphalan-mediated Chk2 activation (Fig. 6C). Thus, these data support the
hypothesis that mTOR pathway is required for an early step(s)
in ATM-Chk2 checkpoint activation in response to ICL.

Discussion
In this study, we observed that an mTOR-selective kinase
inhibitor sensitized pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts
to radiotherapy and rhabdomyosarcoma cells to ICL. Control
of FANCD2 transcripts and protein levels by mTOR signaling
(Supplementary Fig. S3A) may, at least partially, contribute to
the sensitization of cancer cells. Furthermore, FANCD2 is
required for timely ATM-Chk2 checkpoint activation in
response to ICL in Rh30 cells, suggesting that one of the
mechanisms that Fanconi anemia signaling promotes cell
survival of ICL is through potentiation of ATM-Chk2 activation
(Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Importantly, therapy-using agents that damage DNA and
radiotherapy are essential components of many clinical protocols, and form the backbone for curative treatment of several
childhood malignancies. ICL-based chemotherapies, such as
cisplatin or cyclophosphamide, are ﬁrst-line drugs for treatment of many cancers. Our observation that cancer cells are
sensitized to melphalan and ionizing radiation by an mTOR
kinase inhibitor provides a strategy for cancer therapy by
combination of targeting mTOR signaling with these DNAdamaging modalities.
Our ﬁndings may provide the explanation for recent reports
about the involvement of mTOR signaling in DDR. Several
groups found that inhibition of mTOR signaling resulted in
gH2AX and impairment of DDR following exposure to DNAdamaging agents in cultured cells (31–33). The key function of
DDR is to maximize cell survival by promoting DNA repair (30).
Induction of gH2AX following inhibition of mTOR signaling
suggests impairment of DNA strand break repair. Moreover,
inhibition of mTOR signaling in MCF-7 cells was shown to
result in impaired recruitment of BRCA1 and RAD51 to DNA

Regulation of FANCD2 by mTOR

Figure 5. ATR-Chk1 precedes the activation of ATM-Chk2 in response to ICL. A, Rh30 cells were treated with 2 mg/mL melphalan for the time as
indicated. Total proteins were extracted for immunoblotting to detect Chk1, pChk1-S345, gH2AX, and PARP1. B, Rh30 cells were treated with 2 mg/mL
melphalan for the time as indicated. Total proteins were extracted for immunoblotting to detect pChk1-S345, ATM, and pATM-S1981. C, Rh30 cells were
transfected with control or FANCD2 siRNA. Forty-eight hours later, melphalan with the indicated concentrations was added for 8 hours. Total proteins
were extracted for immunoblotting of gH2AX, pChk1-S345, and FANCD2. D, Rh30 cells were transfected with FANCD2 siRNA for 48 hours or AZD8055
(2 mmol/L) for 16 hours. A total of 2 mg/mL melphalan was added alone or in the cells with AZD8055 or FANCD2 siRNA for 8 hours. FANCD2 and gH2AX was

repair foci (34). BRCA1 and RAD51 promote repair of DNA DSB
by homologous recombination (HR). Fanconi anemia signaling
is essential for cells to survive DNA ICL by coordinating DNA
damage repair through translesion DNA synthesis (TLS),
nucleotide excision repair (NER), and HR (35). Therefore,
downregulation of FANCD2 by inhibition of mTOR signaling
may, at least partially, explain the impaired DDR in response to
DNA-damaging agents.
Recently, it was shown that ATM is synthetically lethal with
Fanconi anemia (28). Fifteen FANC genes have been identiﬁed
in Fanconi anemia or Fanconi anemia-like patients (35, 36).
FANCD2 is the key component of Fanconi anemia signaling.
Activation of Fanconi anemia pathway by ICL leads to monoubiquitination of FANCI-FANCD2 by Fanconi anemia core E3
ubiquitin ligase complex. Activated FANCI-FANCD2 is
recruited to DNA damage sites, and helps endonucleases to
cut both sides of ICL to generate DNA strand breaks, and
promotes TLS, NER, and Rad51-mediated HR together with

BRCA1 and BRCA2 (FANCD1; ref. 37). FANCD2-mediated
nucleolytic incisions near the ICL result in a DNA DSB (26,
27), predicted to activate ATM-Chk2. In support of this model,
our data show that FANCD2 is required for ATM-Chk2 activation in the early steps of Fanconi anemia signaling-mediated
repair of ICL-induced DNA lesions.
Our observation that FANCD2 is controlled by mTOR signaling and mTOR inhibition led to attenuation of ATM-Chk2
checkpoint activation by ICL provides the molecular mechanism by which inhibition of mTOR signaling sensitizes cancer
cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. FANCD2 is required
for repair of DSB and intra-S-phase checkpoint activation
(20, 35). Although the Fanconi anemia pathway is essential
for cells to survive ICL, it can be activated by most DNA
damage including DSB, single-strand breaks, base damage,
intra- and interstrand DNA crosslinks, and DNA replication
block (37). We found attenuated activation of ATR-Chk1 and
ATM-Chk2 in PD20 cells under normal growth conditions,

39). Thus FANCD2-dependent activation of ATM checkpoint
may be one of the mechanisms by which Fanconi anemia
signaling promotes cell survival in response to ICL.
In addition, our data showed that FANCD2 is positively
regulated by CDK4 while being apparently negatively controlled by CDK6 in Rh30 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). These
results could suggest a distinct role of CDK4 and CDK6 in
regulating FANCD2, although this may be context speciﬁc.
Finally, AZD8055 also decreased the protein levels of FANCD2
in PD20 cells, which was rescued by wild-type FANCD2 via a
retroviral vector (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that mTOR
signaling also regulates FANCD2 at posttranscriptional
levels.
In summary, we show that FANCD2 is under tight control
of the mTOR pathway and FANCD2 is required for the timely
activation of the ATM checkpoint in response to ICL in
pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Our data provide the basis
for the sensitization of cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents by
targeting the mTOR pathway. The observation that mTOR
signaling protects cells from therapeutic modalities used in
treatment of human malignancies, gives insight into potential
strategies that may enhance therapeutic activity or reduce
sequellae that result from high-dose therapies, particularly in
children.

hydroxyurea-induced DNA replication stress, and melphalanmediated DNA damage. ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 checkpoints are the central genome surveillance systems to maintain
cell survival in response to endogenous and exogenous DNA
damage. DNA damage or replication stress leads to ATR-Chk1
and ATM-Chk2 checkpoints activation to maintain cell survival by stabilizing stalled DNA replication forks, preventing
the ﬁring of late origins and promoting DNA damage repair (38,
