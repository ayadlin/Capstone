To the Editor:
We read with interest the article by Veselik and colleagues in the
May issue of Cancer Research (1). Using human breast cancer cells,
they show that inorganic nitrate and nitrite mimicked the effects
of estradiol on cell growth and gene induction via activation of
estrogen receptor-a. The findings add to the growing body of
evidence now suggesting important physiologic roles for these
supposedly inert anions (2).
The observed effects are remarkable, especially when considering
the extremely low concentrations that were used. In humans,
normal plasma levels of nitrate are f20 to 40 Amol/L, and for
nitrite, 50 to 500 nmol/L (2, 3). The authors report potent effects at
concentrations far below these levels, and in many cases, lower than
what is ever seen in vivo . Given the physiologic plasma
levels of nitrate, nitrite, and estradiol, this study implies that
the three compounds are equally important in regulating estrogen
receptor-a in vivo, with a further shift after menopause. Surprisingly, nitrate and nitrite were equipotent, suggesting a complete
conversion of nitrate to nitrite. A functional mammalian nitrate
reductase activity was indeed described recently, although in that
study, the rate of aerobic nitrate reduction was much lower (4).
Of concern is that most cell culture media already contain
nitrate and nitrite at fairly high concentrations. Using a highly
sensitive chemiluminescence method (3, 5), we measured nitrate
and nitrite in 10 different culture media with or without the
addition of charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Nitrate varied
between 0.8 and 100 Amol/L, whereas nitrite levels were 50 and 400
nmol/L. Therefore, it is highly surprising to see significant effects
after adding only 1 Amol/L of nitrate. Did the authors measure
nitrate and nitrite levels in the medium?
The authors suggest a possible endocrine-like role for nitrate and
nitrite in breast cancer. Again, we find it hazardous to extrapolate
the present results to a discussion regarding dietary nitrate in
relation to breast cancer because the effect should already be close
to maximal from the normal levels of nitrate and nitrite present in
blood and tissues.
