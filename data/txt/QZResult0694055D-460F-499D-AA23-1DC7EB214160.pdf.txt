ABSTRACT:
Molecular markers for predicting or monitoring the efficacy of bevacizumab
in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remain to be identified. We
have now measured the serum concentrations of 25 angiogenesis-related molecules
with antibody suspension bead array systems for 25 mCRC patients both before and
during treatment in a previously reported phase II trial of FOLFIRI chemotherapy
plus bevacizumab. The serum concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor–A
(VEGF-A) decreased after the onset of treatment (P < 0.0001), whereas that of
placental growth factor increased (P < 0.0001). Significant differences in the levels
of several factors (such as VEGF-A, soluble VEGF receptor–2, and interleukin-8) were
apparent between responders and nonresponders during treatment. The rapid and
pronounced decrease in serum VEGF-A level after treatment onset was apparent in all
subjects and was independent of the baseline concentration. However, four of nine
nonresponders showed a subsequent early increase in the serum VEGF-A level. Our
results thus suggest that an early increase in the serum VEGF-A concentration after
the initial decrease is a potential predictive marker of a poor response and reactive
resistance to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

application of this strategy being pursued in the form
of multiple modalities that include the development of
specific inhibitors of signaling by vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and its cognate receptors
(VEGFRs). Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal
antibody specific for VEGF-A, a key inducer of
angiogenesis in tumors, and it has been found to manifest

Angiogenesis, defined as the formation of new
blood vessels from a preexisting vasculature, is essential
for tumor growth and the spread of metastases [1, 2].
Inhibition of angiogenesis is therefore considered a
promising strategy for cancer treatment, with clinical

clinical activity in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer (mCRC) [3]. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of
chemotherapy is blunted by the production of VEGF
and other proangiogenic factors that recruit new
endothelial cells and protect them from chemotherapy,
and bevacizumab transiently “normalizes” the abnormal
structure and function of the tumor vasculature to
render it more efficient for oxygen and drug delivery
[4]. Indeed, bevacizumab is effective against metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC) mainly in combination with
chemotherapeutic drugs.
The efficacy of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab
varies among patients, however, and so the ability
to identify tumors likely to be most sensitive to such
treatment would help to optimize the implementation
of this approach as well as provide important insight
into the mechanisms of resistance. The identification
of a biomarker predictive of bevacizumab treatment
outcome has proven to be challenging. Angiogenesis
is a complex and highly adaptive biological process,
with multiple factors in addition to VEGF-A playing an
essential role, including placental growth factor (PlGF),
fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF), angiopoietins, and various additional
cytokines [5]. Reactive resistance to bevacizumab in
combination with chemotherapy is mediated in part by
hypoxia-inducible factor–1 (HIF-1) and its transcriptional
activation of genes for multiple factors including VEGF-A
and FGFs.
Extensive biomarker analysis has been conducted
in numerous clinical trials of bevacizumab, with
evaluation of the relation between circulating VEGF-A
levels at baseline and treatment outcome having been
performed in most cases [6]. Although a few studies
have detected a significant correlation between the
baseline serum concentration of VEGF-A and the
outcome of antiangiogenic therapy [7], many others
have not. The inconsistency of these results emphasizes
the need for evaluation of predictive biomarkers in a
dynamic manner—that is, before and after the onset of
antiangiogenic treatment.
We have previously described a phase II study
(AVASIRI trial) designed to investigate the efficacy of a
bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil,
irinotecan) regimen as a second-line treatment for
individuals with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) [8].
Promising results were obtained with regard to response
rate (32%), progression-free survival (PFS) time (median
of 11.6 months), and overall survival (OS) time (median
of 21.4 months). Serum samples were collected at various
time points during the trial for measurement of the levels
of 25 angiogenesis-related molecules. We now present the
results of the analysis of these serum samples from the
AVASIRI trial.

Patient characteristics
Serum samples were available for all 25
patients treated with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab. The
characteristics of the study patients are shown in Table
1. The median age was 62 years (range, 38–73), and the
male/female distribution was 20/5. The overall response
rate was 32%, with 8 patients showing a partial response,
15 stable disease, and 2 disease progression. Median
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
were 11.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.9–
16.4] and 21.4 months (95% CI, 12.0–30.8), respectively.

Circulating levels of angiogenesis-related
molecules before and during treatment with
FOLFIRI and bevacizumab
We examined changes in the serum concentrations
of 25 angiogenesis-related molecules between before
(baseline) and after the onset of treatment with FOLFIRI
plus bevacizumab (Figure 1). The baseline serum
concentrations varied widely among individuals, with the
values for VEGF-A, for example, ranging from 13 to 907
pg/mL. Significant changes in the serum levels of various
molecules were apparent at various time points during
treatment compared with baseline (Figure 2). Of note,
the serum concentration of VEGF-A decreased markedly
after the onset of treatment (from 337.7 ± 244.4 pg/mL at
baseline to 1.9 ± 5.0, 5.6 ± 12.6, 8.2 ± 17.5, and 7.3 ± 20.8
pg/mL at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months, respectively; P < 0.0001),
whereas that of PlGF showed a pronounced increase (from
4.1 ± 3.4 pg/mL at baseline to 17.6 ± 9.0, 19.9 ± 7.9, 21.9
± 12.3, and 24.4 ± 10.8 pg/mL at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months,
respectively; P < 0.0001). Given that these results were
obtained with paired samples from the same individuals
at baseline and after the onset of treatment, the observed
changes were likely attributable to the administration of
FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab.

Serum concentrations of angiogenesis-related
molecules and PFS
We divided the patients into two groups on the
basis of progression-free survival (PFS) time. Given
that the median PFS for patients with mCRC treated
with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in the second-line
setting was previously found to be ~7 months [9], we
dichotomized our patient population according to a PFS
of 7 months (responders, ≥7 months; nonresponders, <7
months). None of the 25 molecules examined served as
a predictive marker on the basis of the baseline serum

concentrations, whereas significant differences in the
levels of various molecules [including soluble VEGFR-2
(sVEGFR-2), interleukin (IL)–8, VEGF-A, and VEGF-C]
at various time points during treatment were apparent
between responders and nonresponders (Table 2).

progression relative to the lowered value apparent after
the onset of treatment and during its administration for
several months. Of note, four nonresponders showed an
early increase in the serum concentration of VEGF-A
(cases 17–20 in Figure 3B). The PFS of these four patients
was significantly shorter than that of the other 21 patients
(200 versus 373 days, respectively; P = 0.009, Student’s
unpaired t test), suggesting that an early increase in
serum VEGF-A level subsequent to an initial decrease is
predictive of early resistance to bevacizumab. On the other
hand, the serum concentration of VEGF-A remained stable
at the time of disease progression in other patients (cases
13–16). Patient 15 continued treatment with bevacizumab,
in combination with a different chemotherapy regimen
(mFOLFOX6), beyond disease progression.

FOLFIRI-bevacizumab
treatment and changes in serum VEGF-A level
Finally, we investigated the relation between
changes in the serum concentration of VEGF-A and the
duration of treatment with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab
(Figure 3). Several patients manifested an increase in
the serum VEGF-A level around the time of disease

suggest that the antibody suspension bead array system
adopted in the present study measures VEGF-A that is free
of bevacizumab.
An initial decrease in serum VEGF-A level was
observed in all patients of the present study. However,
some patients manifested a subsequent early small but
definite increase in this parameter. This latter finding may
be related to the assay measuring free VEGF-A and may
therefore reflect a compensatory increase in the circulating
concentration of this factor. Our observation that the PFS
of such patients was shorter than that of the other subjects
suggests that the development of acquired resistance to
bevacizumab treatment may be driven in part by loss of the
ability to suppress the circulating level of free VEGF-A.
VEGF-A promotes the survival of and increases resistance
to chemotherapy in cancer cells. Chemotherapy acts as
an “accidental” antiangiogenic therapy (action), whereas
VEGF-A and other proangiogenic factors recruit new
endothelial cells and protect them from the cytotoxicity of
chemotherapy (reaction) [4, 23]. Bevacizumab is thought
to block this reaction. From this perspective, our results
suggest that an early increase in VEGF-A levels after the
initial decrease is a potential predictive marker of reactive
resistance to bevacizumab that results in a shorter PFS
in patients treated with the combination of FOLFIRI and
bevacizumab.
Despite the predominant role of VEGF-A, multiple
other factors contribute to regulation of the complex and
highly adaptive process of angiogenesis. Investigation of
potential biomarkers other than VEGF-A is thus important,
given the role of these other factors in tumor angiogenesis
and vessel maturation. However, only a few studies
have previously examined multiple angiogenesis-related
proteins during bevacizumab treatment in a dynamic

The introduction of novel molecularly targeted
therapies, including antiangiogenic and anti–epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents, has increased the
options available for treatment of mCRC [9]. At present,
bevacizumab in combination with fluoropyrimidinebased chemotherapy is widely recognized as a standard
treatment for mCRC [3, 9, 10]. However, no biomarker
has previously been identified as a predictor of benefit
from bevacizumab treatment, with the identification
of such a molecular biomarker being a current priority
of clinical research [11]. In the present study, we have
addressed this issue by measuring the serum levels of
multiple angiogenesis-related factors both before and
during treatment of mCRC patients with bevacizumab
plus FOLFIRI.
Most previous studies have found that the circulating
concentration of VEGF-A, as measured with standard
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, increases after
the onset of antiangiogenic treatment [7, 12-18], whereas
more recent studies have shown a decrease in VEGF-A
levels after treatment onset [19-21]. We have now shown
that treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy was
associated with a rapid and highly significant decrease in
the serum concentration of VEGF-A that was independent
of the baseline concentration and which, in most cases,
remained apparent throughout the duration of therapy,
similar to the results of a previous pharmacodynamic
analysis of angiogenesis-related factors [22]. Although
it remains unclear whether circulating VEGF-A in
individuals treated with bevacizumab is free or bound to
the antibody, given that bevacizumab is administered at
doses high enough to give rise to such binding, our results

manner [22]. We have now detected significant treatmentinduced changes in the serum concentrations of several
angiogenesis-related molecules including PlGF. Previous
biomarker analyses also described an increase in the
circulating concentration of PlGF in response to VEGFtargeted treatment [12, 14, 15, 17, 22]. Indeed, targeting
of PlGF is under consideration as a novel approach to
prevent tumor escape from VEGF-targeted therapy [24].
However, we did not detect a significant difference in
serum PlGF levels after bevacizumab administration
between responders and nonresponders in the present
study. A previous study also found that the combination of
antibodies to PlGF and those to VEGF-A did not yield a
greater antitumor effect in vitro or in vivo compared with
antibodies to VEGF-A alone [25]. Our data thus suggest
that the increase in circulating PlGF level observed after
the onset of bevacizumab treatment does not play a major
role in the development of resistance to bevacizumab in
the clinical setting.
On the other hand, we detected significantly higher
serum concentrations of several angiogenesis-related
factors [such as IL-8, soluble angiopoietin II (sANG-2),
basic FGF (bFGF), stem cell factor (SCF), and VEGF-C]
in nonresponders compared with responders at various
time points during treatment. Resistance to VEGF-A
pathway inhibitors might occur through VEGF-A–
independent mechanisms, such as up-regulation of other
proangiogenic factors [26-28]. Given that targeting of
these molecules may provide a basis for novel approaches
to prevent tumor escape from bevacizumab treatment,
further analysis of multiple angiogenesis-related factors
in a large number of patients is warranted.
In conclusion, our present results indicate that an
early increase in the serum concentration of VEGF-A after
the initial decrease may be a potential predictive marker
of a poor response and reactive resistance to bevacizumab
plus chemotherapy.

followed by 5-fluorouracil given by injection (400 mg/
m2) and then as a 46-h continuous infusion (2400 mg/
m2). Bevacizumab was administered at a biweekly dose
of 10 mg/kg before the FOLFIRI regimen. Treatment
was discontinued in the event of disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Patients
underwent a computed tomography scan after every four
cycles of treatment for evaluation of tumor response. They
provided written informed consent to receive the treatment
and to participate in translational analyses.

Sample collection and analysis
Blood samples were obtained from all assigned
patients at baseline (before the first dose of study drugs)
as well as at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after the onset of the
treatment protocol (Figure 1). In addition, blood samples
from eight patients who received the study treatment
for >6 months were obtained at the time of disease
progression or last follow-up. Serum separated from the
blood samples was stored at –80°C until analysis.
The serum levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D,
PlGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), IL-8, and heparinbinding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) were measured
with the use of a Milliplex MAP Human Angiogenesis/
Growth Factor Magnetic Bead Panel (Merck Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). Magnetic antibody-conjugated
beads were subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 30 s and
then to vortex-mixing for 1 min in order to reduce bead
aggregation. All samples, quality controls, and standards
were prepared as recommended with the supplied diluents
and were processed in duplicate batches. Assay buffer
(200 µL) was added to each well and then decanted. Each
sample (25 µL) and the prepared beads (25 µL) were then
added to the wells together with buffering solutions. The
plate was sealed, incubated overnight at 4°C, and washed
three times, after which detection antibodies (25 µL) were
added to each well and the plate was incubated for 1 h
at room temperature. Streptavidin-phycoerythrin (25 µL)
was then added to each well, after which the plate was
incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature
and washed three times. Sheath fluid (100 µL) was finally
added to each well, and the assay plate was analyzed with
the Luminex 100 instrument.
The serum levels of transforming growth factor
(TGF)–β1 and TGF-β2 were measured with a Milliplex
MAP Multi-Species TGFβ 3-Plex panel (Merck
Millipore), whereas those of various additional factors
related to angiogenesis were measured with a Bio-Plex
Pro Human Cancer Biomarker Panel 1, 16-Plex (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) as previously described [29].
The latter factors included soluble EGFR (sEGFR), bFGF,
osteopontin, PDGF–AB/BB, follistatin, granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), platelet endothelial
cell adhesion molecule–1 (PECAM-1), prolactin, soluble
human EGF receptor 2/NEU (sHER2/NEU), hepatocyte

METHODS
Patients
The main inclusion criteria for the present study
were the same as those previously described for the
AVASIRI trial [8]. In brief, they comprised a histologically
confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer; failure of
first-line treatment with 5-fluorouracil– or oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy without bevacizumab or CPT-11
(irinotecan); measurable disease according to RECIST
(ver. 1.0); and metastatic disease deemed unresectable
at baseline. Enrolled patients received biweekly
administrations of the FOLFIRI regimen, consisting of
CPT-11 (150 mg/m2) on day 1, given as a 2-h infusion
concurrent with leucovorin (folinic acid, 200 mg/m2),

Statistical analysis
Serum factor levels at baseline (pretreatment) were
compared with those at 1, 2, 4, or 6 months after treatment
onset with the use of Student’s paired t test in order to
evaluate the significance of changes induced by the study
treatment. The relations between treatment efficacy and
serum factor levels were analyzed with Student’s unpaired
t test. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. All statistical tests were performed with SPSS
version 14.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
