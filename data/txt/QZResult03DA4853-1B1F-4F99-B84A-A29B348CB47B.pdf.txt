ABSTRACT
Toll-like receptor3 (TLR3) has been confirmed to be differentially expressed
in neuroblastoma (NB), and predicts a favorable prognosis with a high expression
in tumor tissues. Treatment with TLR3 agonist - polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid
[poly(I:C)] could induce significant but limited apoptosis in TLR3-expressing NB
cells, suggesting that other viral RNA sensors, including melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) in the cytosolic
compartment might also be implicated in poly(I:C)-induced NB cell death. MDA5
and RIG-I were induced by poly(I:C) to express in two of six NB cell lines, SK-NAS (AS) and SK-N-FI, which were associated with up-regulation of caspase9 and
active caspase3. While knockdown of either MDA5 or RIG-I alone is ineffective to
decrease caspase9 and active caspase3, simultaneously targeting MDA5 and TLR3
showed the best effect to rescue poly(I:C) induced up-regulation of mitochondrial
antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), caspase9, active caspase3, and apoptosis in AS
cells. Over-expression of MDA5 in FaDu cells resulted in significantly less colony
formation and more poly(I:C)-induced cell death. Further studies in human NB
tissue samples revealed that MDA5 expression in NB tissues predicted a favorable
prognosis synergistically with TLR3. Our findings indicate that MDA5 may serve as a
complementary role in the TLR3 activated suppression of NB.

group [3, 4]. TLR3 agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid
[poly(I:C)] could induce apoptosis in TLR3-expressing
NB cells, preferentially through mitochondrial pathway
[5]. However, the effects of poly(I:C) on NB cell apoptosis
through TLR3 is limited, suggesting that other cellular
mechanisms in addition to TLR3 should participate in the
poly(I:C) induced cell death.
In addition to TLR3, there are other viral RNA sensors
in the cells, including melanoma differentiation-associated
gene 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I),
which have been implicated in mitochondrial apoptosis

INTRODUCTION
Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric solid tumor
characterized by its wide range of clinical manifestations
and poor outcome for those with high-risk clinical
phenotypes, despite significant advance in the treatment
in the last 10 years [1, 2]. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are
initiators of the innate immune response to pathogens. One
of the TLR family members - TLR3 has been confirmed to
be differentially expressed in NB, and predict a favorable
prognosis with a high expression in tumor tissues by our

of human melanoma cells, as well as proimmunogenic
apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells [6, 7]. MDA5 was
initially isolated by subtraction hybridization as a gene
with interferon-inducible putative RNA helicase, which
demonstrated double-stranded RNA-dependent ATPase
activity and melanoma growth-suppressive properties [8].
RIG-I was isolated by differential display-PCR from acute
promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with all-trans retinoic
acid, and initially known as RIG-E [9].
Both MDA5 and RIG-I belong to retinoic acidinducible gene-I-like receptor (RLR) family and function
uniquely as DExD/H-box helicases for anti-viral innate
immunity [10]. While TLR3 is located on the endosomes,
MDA5 and RIG-I are cytoplasmic RNA sensors [10]. Upon
stimulation of the cells with either viral infection or intrinsic/
extrinsic nucleic acids, MDA5 and RIG-I could interact with
mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) [also known
as IFN-beta promoter stimulator (IPS)-1], which activates
signaling pathways of NFkappaB and interferon regulatory
factors (IRFs) to trigger apoptosis of cancer cells [11, 12].
Recently it was shown that targeting MDA5 and
RIG-I could effectively induce apoptotic signaling and
counteract cancer cell heterogeneity in glioblastoma [13],
suggesting that MDA5 and RIG-I might also be implicated
in the suppression of another neurogenic cancer. In this
study, we found that upon treatment with poly(I:C), SKN-AS (AS) and SK-N-FI NB cells showed an increase of
MDA5 and RIG-I expression levels, which was associated
with an increased expression of caspase9 and active
caspase3. In addition, only simultaneously targeting MDA5
and TLR3 showed the best effect to rescue poly(I:C)induced cancer cell suppression. Further studies of human
NB tissue samples also revealed that MDA5 expression in
NB tissues predicted a favorable prognosis synergistically
with TLR3. These results indicated a complementary role of
MDA5 in TLR3 agonist treatment of NB.

a significant increase of TLR3 mRNA in SK-N-AS after
poly(I:C) treatment, despite no simultaneous increase of
TLR3 protein levels. (Supplementary Figure 1A)
Phosphorylated protein kinase R (p-PKR), an
interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein
kinase, was also activated by both high or low molecular
weight poly(I:C) in both SK-N-AS and SK-N-FI, with an
up-regulation of phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor
3 (p-IRF-3) (Figure 1A). Subsequent to the up-regulation of
dsRNA sensors and their adaptor molecules, there were upregulation of caspase9 and activated caspase3 in both SKN-AS and SK-N-FI, but not in other cell lines (Figure 1A).
Since expression of MDA5 and RIG-I, as well as activated
caspase-3 was consistently higher in SK-N-AS than in SKN-FI after treatment with high molecular weight (HMW)
poly(I:C), the results of subsequent in vitro studies were
based on the findings in SK-N-AS.

Expression of PKR, IRF3, MAVS, caspase 9/3 and
apoptosis in SK-N-AS after poly(I:C) treatment
and siRNA targeting TLR3, MDA5 and RIG-I
Treatment of SK-N-AS cells with poly(I:C)-HMW
resulted in significant increase of mRNA levels of TLR3,
MDA5 and RIG-I (Supplementary Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C).
The increase of mRNA levels of TLR3, MDA5 and RIG-I
after treatment with poly(I:C) was suppressed by specific
knockdown of each gene at a level of 60%, 40% and 70%,
respectively (Supplementary Figure 1A, 1B and 1C).
There was no further suppression of each gene expression
by double knockdown of either two genes, indicating that
there was no mutual interference of each gene expression.
As for protein expression after siRNA targeting
TLR3, MDA5 and RIG-I, there were some difference
among these three receptors. While TLR3, as a membrane
protein on the endosomes, showed little change after
siRNA targeting, MDA5 and RIG-I demonstrated a
significant decrease of protein expression after siRNA
targeting (Supplementary Figure 2A, 2B and 2C). Similar
to mRNA expression, double knockdown did not further
suppress MDA5 and RIG-I protein expression levels.
siRNA targeting MDA5 revealed down-regulation
of p-IRF3, but was not associated with down-regulation
of caspase9 and active caspase3. In fact, treatment of
NB cells with poly(I:C) was associated with elevated
caspase9 and activated caspase3 with subsequent elevated
MAVS regardless scramble siRNA or siMDA5 treatment.
A similar findings were found in siRIG-I and siTLR3
treatment (Supplementary Figure 3). However, concomitant
knockdown of MDA5 and TLR3 were more effective to
suppress upregulation of caspase9 and activated caspase
3 triggered by poly(I:C) treatment in NB cells than either
single knockdown or other double knockdowns of TLR3,
MDA5, and RIG-I. Interestingly, cleaved MAVS and
caspase8 were also most significantly decreased in double
knockdown of MDA5 and TLR3 (Figure 1B).

RESULTS
Differential expression of dsRNA sensors,
caspase9 and caspase 3 in NB cell lines after
poly(I:C) treatment
Among the six cell lines, SK-N-AS, SK-N-FI, and
SH-SY5Y had a normal copy number of MYCN, while SKN-DZ, IMR-32 and BE(2)-M17 had MYCN amplification.
All NB cell lines expressed a base-line level of TLR3,
although the level was low in SK-N-DZ. After treatment
with poly(I:C), there was no significant change of TLR3
protein expression in SK-N-DZ, IMR-32 BE(2)-M17, and
SK-N-AS, while there was mild up-regulation of TLR3
expression in, SK-N-FI and SH-SY-5Y. None of the wildtype cell lines expressed MDA5 and RIG-I. But after
high or low molecular weight poly(I:C) treatment, SKN-AS and SK-N-FI showed a significant up-regulation of
MDA5 and RIG-I. (Figure 1A). Interestingly, there was

more effective to suppress upregulation of caspase9 and activated caspase 3 triggered by poly(I:C) treatment than either single knockdown

Apoptosis of NB cells, measured by PI staining,
showed a significant increase after poly(I:C) treatment,
particularly in NB cells treated with scramble siRNA and
poly(I:C) (Figure 1C). NB cells treated with scramble siRNA
alone did not increase NB cell death. Single knockdown
of MDA5 and RIG-I showed little effect in rescuing NB
cell death activated by scramble RNA+poly(I:C) treatment,
while siTLR3 showed a significant though limited effect in
rescuing these cells. However, simultaneous targeting TLR3
and MDA5 with siRNA showed most effective to rescue
poly(I:C) or scramble RNA+poly(I:C)-induced NB cell
death (Figure 1C).

other cell lines were also tried, but only FaDu cells
that derived from a squamous cell carcinoma of the
hypopharynx survived the transfection, which was
confirmed by qRT-PCR and fluorescent microscopy
(Figure 2A and 2B). Colony formation of FaDu cells
after transfection with MDA5 expression plasmid
decreased significantly, as compared to the control
cells. (Figure 2C and 2D). Furthermore, treatment of
MDA5- overexpression FaDu cells with poly(I:C)
resulted in significantly more cell deaths than that of
wild type cells (Figure 2E).
Over-expression of MDA5 in NB cells was
achievable only in SK-N-BE by Tet-inducible MDA5
expression system (Supplementary Methods and Supple­

SK-N-BE cells revealed dose-dependent decrease of cell
viability (Supplementary Figure 4B). However, treatment
of MDA5-overexpressed SK-N-BE cells with poly(I:C)
showed no difference in cell viability comparing to the
control wild type cells. (Supplementary Figure 4C).

Over-expression of MDA5 suppressed colony
formation and sensitized poly(I:C) induced cell

factor for NB (Table 2). Multivariate analysis further
revealed that MYCN status and negative MDA5 expression
remained independent prognostic factors for poor survival
(Table 2). To further evaluate the significance of MDA5
expression in prognostic discrimination, the impact
of MDA5 expression on survival rate was analyzed
according to patients’ risk grouping. Both patients
with low and intermediate risk had excellent prognosis
regardless the MDA5 status. Nevertheless, positive MDA5
expression predicted a better survival probability for NB
patients with high risk (P = 0.020, log-rank test; Figure
4C). To explore the possible synergistic effect of MDA5
and TLR3 expression on patient survival, Kaplan-Meier
analysis according to the expression of MDA5 and TLR3
was performed. The results revealed that patients with
double positive staining of MDA5 and TLR3 had the
most favorable clinical outcome, while patients with single
positive staining of MDA5 or TLR3 had intermediate
survival probability, and patients with double negative
staining of MDA5 and TLR3 had the poorest survival
probability (P < 0.001, log-rank test; Figure 4D).
The results of the above histological studies were
further supported by quantitative measurement of MDA5
mRNA expression in the tissue, which demonstrated that
NB tumor tissues with MDA5 mRNA expression levels
higher than median value showed a higher percentage
of positive MDA5 immunostaining (Supplementary
Table S1). Furthermore, higher MDA5 mRNA expression
in tumors also correlated with younger age at diagnosis,
early clinical stages, and favorable Shimada histology
(Supplementary Table 1). Survival analysis also confirmed
that higher MDA5 mRNA expression predicted a better
5-year survival (Supplementary Figures 5 and 6).

Both intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS) measured by DCF-DA and MitoSOX
RED™, respectively, showed a significant increase after
NB cells treated with poly(I:C) (Figure 3A and 3B). The
increased intracellular ROS levels were not affected by
single knockdown of TLR3 or concomitant knockdown
of TLR3 and MDA5 (Figure 3A). However, the increased
mitochondrial ROS was significantly suppressed by either
single siTLR3 or concomitant siTLR3 and siMDA5
transfection (Figure 3B).

MDA5 expression in human NB tissues implied a
favorable tumor behavior
Since we have shown that double knockdown of
TLR3 and MDA5 was most effective to rescue Poly(I:C)
induced NB cell death and that high expression of TLR3
in NB tumor tissues carries a favorable patient outcome
[4], we would like to further investigate the role of
MDA5 expression in human NB tumor behaviors. MDA5
expression in 92 NB tumor samples were evaluate by
immunohistochemistry. Positive
MDA5 immunoreactivity (2+ and 3+) was detected
in 41 samples (44.6%). MDA5 immunostaining was
negative in neuroblastic cells in undifferentiated NB
(Figure 4A, upper left). In differentiating NB, various
intensities of MDA5 staining could be found in either
the cytoplasm or nucleus (Figure 4A, upper right
and lower left, arrows) of the neuroblastic cells. In
ganglioneuroblastoma, strong nuclear staining in the
neuroblastic cells, as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic
staining in ganglion cells was found (Figure 4A, lower
right, arrows and arrow heads). No stromal cells
demonstrated MDA5 staining. The results suggested that
MDA5 expression in NB tissues may indicate a sign of
histological differentiation.
Further analysis of the relationship between
MDA5 immunostaining and other clinicopathological
characteristics of NB, we found that in addition to
histological grade of differentiation, positive MDA5
staining also strongly correlated with younger age at
diagnosis (P = 0.044, χ2 test), early clinical stages (P =
0.001, χ2 test), favorable histology (P = 0.007, χ2 test), and
MYCN non-amplified (P = 0.001, χ2 test) (Table 1).
To explore the significance of MDA5 expression on
patient survival, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed
and showed that patients with MDA5-positive tumors had
a better predictive 5-year survival rate than those with
MDA5-negative tumors (P < 0.001, log-rank test; Figure
4B). Univariate analysis showed that in addition to MDA5
expression, age at diagnosis, clinical stage, MYCN status,
and Shimada classification could also serve as a prognostic

DISCUSSION
MDA5 and RIG-I are cytosolic receptors responsible
for the detection of viral RNA, which have been expected
to respond to synthetic dsRNA— poly(I:C) similar to
TLR3 in NB [3]. Yet, it has been shown that MDA5
and RIG-I may recognize different types of dsRNAs:
MDA5 recognizes poly(I:C), and RIG-I detects in vitro
transcribed dsRNAs [14, 15]. It is plausible that cytosolic
MDA5 may possibly work together with endosome TLR3
to response to poly(I:C) treatment in NB cells. Indeed,
in this study we found that while single knockdown of
either MDA5 or RIG-I alone fails to suppress poly(I:C)induced NB cell death, concomitant knockdown of MDA5
and TLR3 was effective to rescue poly(I:C)-induced NB
cell death. Importantly, in consistence with the in vitro
studies, MDA5 and TLR3 expression in tumor tissues
also showed a synergistic effect on NB patient survival.
The complementary roles of TLR3 and MDA5 have also
been demonstrated in other studies with melanoma and
NK cells [16, 17]. These lines of evidence strongly support

the potential role of targeting innate immune system in the
treatment of NB.
In the 6 NB cell lines tested, although all of them
showed a variable level of TLR3 expression, none of them
showed expression of MDA5 and RIG-I. After treatment
with high or low molecular weight poly(I:C), two cell lines
(SK-N-AS and SK-N-FI, both are MYCN non-amplified)
showed increased expression of MDA5 and RIG-I as
well as cell apoptosis. Forced expression of MDA5 by
plasmid transfection in NB cells induced a rapid cell death
even without poly(I:C) treatment. Similar results were
also observed in RIG-I transfection experiments (data
not shown). It has been shown that RIG-I and MDA5,
containing two N-terminal CARD domains and a C-terminal
helicase domain, which may trigger DNA fragmentation
in response to a small amount of apoptotic cell substrates
or active caspase-3 [8]. This finding may explain the
instability of the cells transfected with MDA5 or RIG-I,
which ultimately leaded to cell death. Over-expression of
MDA5 was achievable only in SK-N-BE by Tet-inducible
MDA5 expression system. However, this system was
hampered by inhibition of cleavage of caspase-3 when
exposed to inducing ligand doxycycline and thus interfered
the interpretation of the results of cell death [18]. In this
study, we have also observed no significant expression of
cleavage of caspase-3 (data not shown), which can explain
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

no significant decrease of cell viability when treating
MDA5-overexpressed SK-N-BE cells with poly(I:C).
FaDu cells, derived from a squamous cell
carcinoma of the hypopharynx, however, could survive
from the MDA5 transfection without using Tet-inducible
gene expression system. MDA5 over-expressed FaDu
cells become sensitive to poly(I:C) induced cell death.
Obviously there exists a differential tolerance to MDA5
expression between different cell types. However, more
studies are required to verify the surmise.
We found that siTLR3 could rescue NB cells from
poly(I:C) induced cell death and that this rescue effect of
siTLR3 could be improved by additional suppression of
MDA5. In addition, there was no any cell rescue effect
by concomitant suppression of MDA5 and RIG-I. These
lines of evidence suggest that TLR3 may play a key role in
the innate immune mediated NB cell death, while MDA5
may serve a major complementary role to TLR3 in this
pathway. Given the finding that MDA5 and RIG-I are
absent in all NB cells, a defective innate immune system
could be critical for the tumorigenesis of NB.
MDA5 has been a well-known tumor suppressor
since it was first identified [6, 8, 19]. Here we showed
that high MDA5 expression in NB tumor tissues did
correlate well with differentiated tumor histology as
well as other favorable clinical and biological factors.

Survival analysis revealed that high MDA5 expression in
NB tissues predicted a favorable patient prognosis. These
findings supported that MDA5 could play as a tumor
suppressor in NB. On the other hand, although RIG-I
has been recognized as a tumor suppressor in several
human cancers including ovarian cancer, leukemia and
hepatocellular carcinoma [7, 20, 21], a dual role of RIG-I
in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has
been observed [22]. Upon treatment of cells with viral
dsRNA, a low level of RIG-I activation increases host cell
survival, whereas a higher level of RIG-I activation leads
to cell apoptosis [22]. Furthermore, opposing roles of RNA
receptors TLR3 and RIG-I in the inflammatory response
to dsRNA has also been shown in a Kaposi’s sarcoma
cell line SLK [23]. While TLR3 mediated inflammatory
response to poly(I:C), siRIG-I resulted in enhanced
chemokine release, in a TLR3 pathway-dependent manner
[23]. The role of RIG-I in our NB model may be similar
to that in SLK. Our results showed that while siRIG-I

enhanced poly(I:C) induced apoptosis, further knockdown
of TLR3 could reduce the apoptosis rate.
In addition to anti-viral signaling through induction
of type I IFN, MDA5 and RIG-I also induced proapoptotic
BH3-only protein expression and human melanoma cell
death [6]. Here we further showed that upon treatment
with high or low molecular weight poly(I:C), there
was upregulation of MDA5 and RIG-I with increased
expression of caspase9 and cspase3 in NB cells, which
was similar to the activation of TLR3 [3]. Yet, knockdown
of MDA5 and RIG-I was accompanied by a decrease of
p-PKR and p-IRF3 but not a decrease of MAVS, caspase
3, caspase 9, and apoptosis. The above findings support the
notion that multiple signaling pathways may be involved
in the innate immune mediated apoptosis process [24]. On
the other hand, MAVS is known to connect mitochondria
with innate immunity. RNA binding induces MDA5 to
activate MAVS through interactions between the caspase
recruitment domains (CARDs) on these two proteins

[25, 26]. It has been shown that MAVS is cleaved during
apoptosis after caspase activation [27]. The results of our
study echoed these observations by showing that poly(I:C)
treatment induced cleavage of MAVS, which was
attenuated when either TLR3 or both TLR3 and MDA5
were suppressed, leading subsequently to decreased
caspase9 and capase3 expression, mitochondrial ROS
production, and NB cells apoptosis.
In this study, we found significant increase in
both intracellular (or general) and mitochondrial ROS
in poly(I:C)-treated NB cells. However, only increased
mitochondrial ROS, but not intracellular ROS, was
significantly suppressed by either single siTLR3 or
concomitant siTLR3 and siMDA5 transfection. It was
consistent with the report that docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA)-induced MAPK activation and apoptosis was
associated with mitochondrial ROS overproduction and
malfunction, and that ROS inhibition remarkably reversed
these effects of DHA [28]. It also echoed the findings that
ROS induction by a quinone-containing natural product
shikonin was of mitochondrial origin, which then induced
apoptosis in glioma cells [29].
Despite there was significant increase of TLR3
mRNA expression after poly(I:C) treatment of SK-NAS cells, the protein levels showed no significant change,
which was contrary to the expression of MDA5 and RIG-I.
Similar findings were shown in 9-cis-retinoic-acid (9cRA)
treatment of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, which revealed no
significant change of TLR3, MDA5 and PKR, but significant
up-regulation of RIG-I. However, poly(I:C) could synergize
with 9cRA to up-regulate TLR3, RIG-I, MDA5 and PKR,
leading to apoptosis of SK-BR-3 cells [30]. Similar findings
were shown in Me 260 cells, which failed to respond to
poly(I:C) alone, but IFN-α+ poly(I:C) could induce upregulation of TLR3 and induced melanoma cell death [31].
In summary, we identify a particular tumor
suppressor role for MDA5 in NB. MDA5 may
complement TLR3 dependent innate immune mediated
NB cell death. In addition, MDA5 expression may predict
a favorable outcome in NB patients with a synergistic
effect with TLR3. Further elucidating the role of TLR3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and MDA5 expression in NB may not only shed light to
the pathogenesis of NB but also potential therapy of NB
by targeting innate immune system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
Six human NB cell lines (SK-N-AS, SK-N-FI,
SK-N-DZ, IMR-32, BE(2)-M17 and SH-SY5Y) were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA). Cell culture reagents were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). SKN-AS, SK-N-FI and SK-N-DZ were cultured with
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing
L-glutamine; IMR-32 was cultured with Eagle’s Minimum
Essential Medium (MEM) containing sodium pyruvate;
BE(2)-M17 was cultured with a 1:1 mixture of MEM
and F-12 medium containing sodium pyruvate; SH-SY5Y was cultured with a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F-12
medium. All of the above culture mediums contain 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM
nonessential amino acids and antibiotic-antimycotic. Cells
were cultured in 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37°C.

Treatment of human NB cells with poly(I:C)HMW or poly(I:C)-LMW
1 × 106 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes
and treated with 50 μg/ml of polyinosinic:polycytidylic
acid high molecular weight [poly(I:C)HMW; Invitrogen]
or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid low molecular weight
[poly(I:C)LMW; Invitrogen] in culture medium plus 10%
FBS for 24 h. Poly(I:C)HMW has an average size of 1.5–
8 kb, while poly(I:C)LMW has an average of 0.2–1 kb.

control (scramble) siRNA were purchased from GeneDireX
(Las Vegas, NV, USA) .The sequences for siMDA5 was
5′-GUAUCGUGUUAUUGGAUUAdTdT-3′; for siRIG-I
5′-AUCACGGAUUAGCGACAAAdTdT-3; for siTLR3,
5′-AAAGGUAGUGGCUUGACAGCUCAGG-3′ and for
control siRNA, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′,
respectively. MDA5 siRNA was designed according to
published guidelines. Gene delivery of siRNA into SKN-AS was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. 5 × 106 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture
dishes 24 h before transfection. For single knockdown,
25 nM siRNA in 7.5 μl DEPC water (tube 1) and 20 μl
of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (tube 2) were
separately diluted in 500 μl Opti-MEM (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) without serum, and then mixed and
incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature. For double
knockdown, 25 nM of two different siRNAs in 7.5 μl (tube
1) and 20 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (tube
2) were separately diluted in 500 μl Opti-MEM without
serum, and then mixed and incubated for 15–20 min at
room temperature. The mixture was put into culture dishes
containing NB cells for 6 h and the culture medium was
replaced and transfection continued for another 18 h (for
a total of 24 h). The cells were then incubated with 50 μg/
ml poly(I:C)HMW for 24 h before analysis.

10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen Life
Technologies). FaDu (3 × 105 cells in six-well plates) was
transfected with either GFP (green fluorescent protein)
plasmid (pMV6-AC-GFP) as a non-targeting control or
MDA5 expression plasmid (IFIH1 human cDNA ORF
Clone) using Lysovec reagent (InvivoGen). At 48 h after
transfection, we aspirated the medium and replaced it with
fresh medium containing 500 μg/ml selective antibiotics
G418. This selection medium was refreshed every 2
days. We monitored the cells daily and observed the
percentage of surviving cells stably expressing MDA5
or control plasmids. At approximately 4 weeks following
transfection, stable cells were visualized by fluorescent
microscopy and harvested for qRT-PCR (quantitative realtime PCR) analysis.

Over-expression of MDA5 in NB and FaDu cells

Trypan blue exclusion assay

The MDA5 expression plasmid [IFIH1 human
cDNA ORF Clone] and control plasmid (pMV6-ACGFP) were obtained from OriGene Technologies
(Rockville, MD). Stable transfection of cells with
MDA5 expression plasmid was performed by culturing
BE(2)-M17 cells and SH-SY-5Y cells. For transfection,
2 × 106 cells were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes one
day before transfection. On the second day, 8 μg plasmid
DNA (tube 1) and 20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(tube 2) were diluted in 500 μl Opti-MEM (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) without serum in separate tubes. Combine
and mix the diluted plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine 2000
reagent gently, then incubate for 15–20 minutes at room
temperature. After incubate, add the mixture into culture
dishes containing cells. Mix gently by rocking the plate
back and forth. After 6 h, the medium was replaced with
culture medium containing 10% FBS. Approximately 48 h
after transfection, the transfected cells were selected with
G418 (800 μg/ml).
After failed NB cell transfection with MDA5
expression plasmid, we shifted to use FaDu cells. FaDu
cell line was derived from a squamous cell carcinoma of
the hypopharynx and was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The cells
were incubated in Minimum Essential Media (MEM)
medium containing 4.5 g/ml glucose (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with
1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen Life Technologies),

Cell death was analyzed by staining cells with
Trypan blue (BioWhittaker, MD, USA). Cells were
harvested and suspended in 2 ml complete medium,
then 10 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 10 μl of
0.4% Trypan blue. Stained cells and unstained cells were
counted with cell counter under microscope, which was
further confirmed by FACScalibur flow cytometer using
CellQuest software.

Colony formation assay
Fadu cells transfected with MDA5 expression
plasmid or control plasmid were trypsinized and replated
at 100 cells per 12 well plate with complete medium
containing G418 (500 μg/ml). The medium containing
G418 was replaced every two days. After 20 days, cells
were fixed with cold methanol and stained with 0.5%
crystal violet solution. The area of colonies was calculated
using Image J software.

Western blot analysis
After treatment, cells were lysed with PRO-PREP™
Protein Extraction Solution (iNtRON Biotechnology;
Seoul, Korea) and protein concentrations were measured
with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Bio-Rad; Richmond,
CA) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Crude
proteins (30 μg) were separated in 10–15% sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes
were immunoblotted overnight at 4°C with each primary
antibody at the indicated dilution. The primary antibodies
included MDA5 (D74E4; Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA), RIG-I (D14G6 ; Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), TLR3 (Abcam
Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), MAVS (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), cleaved caspase 8 (D391, Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), cleaved caspase 9

(N-term; EPITOMICS), p-IRF3 (pS386; EPITOMICS),
IRF3 (N-term; EPITOMICS), and β-actin (Millipole,
Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes were washed three times
and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature.
Protein-antibody complexes were visualized with an
electrochemiluminescence western blotting detection and
analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala,
Sweden), and blots were exposed to film. Signals were

or unfavorable according to the mitosis-karyorrhexis index
and the patient age at diagnosis based on the criteria of the
INPC [32, 33]. Tumor staging was classified according to
the International NB Staging System [34]. MYCN status
was evaluated using chromogenic in situ hybridization
analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues [35].
Based on risk classifications of the Children’s Cancer Group
(CCG), patients were classified into low-, intermediate-, and
high-risk groups and risk-directed therapies were applied
accordingly [36]. The median follow-up after diagnosis
was 38 months (range of 1–156 months), and the overall
predictive 5-year survival rate for this cohort was 55.6%.

Immunohistochemical staining

Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis and
reactive oxygen species

The tissue sections were sliced from the paraffin
blocks and placed onto the silane-coated slides. After
deparaffinization, the sections were treated with 3%
H2O2 for 10 minutes, followed by antigen retrieval with
microwave in 10 mM citrate buffer pH6.0 for 15 min to
unmask the epitopes. Then the sections were incubated
with diluted primary antibodies directed against melanoma
differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5, 1:50 dilution;
ProSci Inc., Poway, CA, USA) at room temperature for
1 hour and rinsed in PBS. Thereafter, a polymerized
reporter enzyme staining system (ImmPRESS™ universal
reagent, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA)
was applied for 30 min according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation. Finally, the signals were visualized by
treatment with ImmPACT™ DAB peroxidase substrate
(Vector Laboratories) and mounted. The staining method
for TLR3 has been described elsewhere [4]. The staining
intensity was scored as 0: no staining, 1: faint or weak
staining, 2: moderate staining, and 3: strong staining.
All the sections were initially scored by two pathologists
(Chao-Cheng Huang; Hong-Lin He) who did not know the
clinical data, respectively. For the cases with discordant
results, the two pathologists read the slides again together
to get a concordance. Both scores 0 and 1 were grouped
as negative staining, and both scores 2 and 3 as positive
staining for the further statistical analysis since there was a
significant difference of survival possibility between these
two groups of patients (Supplementary Figure 4).
To further confirm the results of clinical
significance of MDA5 expression in NB evaluated
by immunohistochemistry, 35 NB fresh frozen tumor
tissues were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR analysis
of mRNA expression.

The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined
by flow cytometry analysis following propidium iodide
staining (PI; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For PI
staining, 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 60-mm culture
dishes. After siRNA transfection for 24 hr, the cells
were then cultured in medium with or without 50 μg/
ml poly(I:C)HMW for 24 h. Cells were harvested and
incubated in 100 μl PBS containing 5 μl PI (50 μg/ml) for
15 min at room temperature. Samples were analyzed using
a FACS (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species were determined by flow cytometry, after cells were
stained with 6- carboxy-2, 7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCF-DA) (Sigma) fluorescent probe and
MitoSOX RED™ kit (Molecular probe, Invitrogen),
respectively. The procedures for each measurement
followed the protocol provided by the manufacturers. The
fluorescence was analyzed on FACScalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software.

Patients and tumor samples
From January 2000 to December 2012, 92 patients
with NB who were treated and had complete follow-up
were enrolled in the study. The study was approved by
Institutional Ethics Committee (100–3966C issued by IRB
of Chang Gung Medical Foundation on February 1, 2013).
The median age at diagnosis was 2.2 years (range 0–11.5
years). The male to female ratio was 60:32. Adrenal gland
was the most common primary tumor site (61/92). Tumor
histology was categorized into four types according to
the criteria of the International Neuroblastoma Pathology
Classification (INPC) [32, 33] including: undifferentiated
NB (UNB), poorly differentiated NB (PDNB),
differentiating NB (DNB), and ganglioneuroblastoma
(GNB), intermixed. The GNB, nodular subtype, was
classified into UNB, PDNB, or DNB according to the
morphologic features of the NB nodules since these
nodules determine the clinical outcome. For prognostic
analysis, tumors were further classified as either favorable

Statistical analysis
All the data present in the figures were represen­
tatives of at least triplicate experiments. Data were
expressed as mean ± SD. Student’s t-test was used for
between-group comparison while analysis of variance for
continuous variables among groups and Mann-Whitney
U-test for nonparametric data. Survival analysis was done

by using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Wilcoxon logrank test to compare difference between groups. Statistical
analysis of histological findings between different NB
groups was performed using Fisher’s exact test. A P-value
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
