Second Primary Malignancies and Myeloma Therapy: Fad or Fact?
Saad Z. Usmani

Since the first report of the efficacy of thalidomide
in refractory multiple myeloma [1] (MM), there has been
remarkable progress made in the biologic understanding of
this disease. MM patients have benefited from a surge in
biology-based novel drug development based on disease
biology with continued improvement in overall survival
over the last 13 years [2,3]. But it appears that living
longer does not come without a price tag. There are now
three randomized phase three clinical trials [4-6], two in
transplant eligible patients and one in transplant ineligible
patients, which have not only reported on improved
progression free survival with lenalidomide (Len), a
derivative of thalidomide, maintenance but they also show
a higher incidence of second primary malignancies (SPM)
with prolonged use of lenalidomide (Table 1). It appears
that this effect is more relevant to patients receiving
lenalidomide after having received melphalan as part
either the transplant regimen or as part of induction in
case of transplant ineligible patients. There also appears
to be evidence that thalidomide may also potentiate solid
SPMs [7], thereby suggesting an immunomodulatory drug
(IMiD) class effect associated with alkylator exposure.
So what does this all mean in the grand scheme
of MM therapy in 2012? Although the data identify a
small subset of MM patients will likely be affected,
SPMs remains a serious issue especially with regard
to the myeloid malignancies [8]. We have previously
published our experience with myelodysplasia-associated
cytogenetic abnormalities [9]. Since autologous stem cell
transplantation (ASCT) has been slow to gain acceptance
as a standard of care for eligible patients over the last
decade, the US centers that have been ASCT proponents
are likely to be observing and reporting on the SPM issue
before others. For now, the available data speak in favor of

Len maintenance in both transplant eligible and ineligible
patients. There, however, needs to be an informed
discussion with the patients about the potential for SPMs
since much is unknown in absence of long-term follow-up
on the three randomized studies [4-6].
The Arkansas group is presently studying the
baseline whole bone marrow gene-expression profiling,
proteomic analyses and single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) to identify patients who may have the propensity to
develop SPMs. This will be most important in the context
of low risk (or standard risk) patients who have a longer
life expectancy than the high-risk patients [10]. The risk
adaptive therapy approach within low risk patients may
involve limiting post-transplant IMiD exposure in patients
who have a higher potential for SPM development. It may
well be that we are looking at the tip of the iceberg in the
year 2012 and SPMs may emerge as an important longterm sequela with further follow-up.
