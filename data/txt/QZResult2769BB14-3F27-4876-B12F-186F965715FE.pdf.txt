ABSTRACT
The CRNDE gene seems to play an oncogenic role in cancers, though its exact
function remains unknown. Here, we tried to assess its usefulness as a molecular
prognostic marker in ovarian cancer. Based on results of our microarray studies,
CRNDE transcripts were further analyzed by Real-Time qPCR-based profiling of their
expression. The qPCR study was conducted with the use of personally designed
TaqMan assays on 135 frozen tissue sections of ovarian carcinomas from patients
treated with platinum compounds and either cyclophosphamide (PC, N = 32) or
taxanes (TP, N = 103). Elevated levels of two different CRNDE transcripts were a
negative prognostic factor; they increased the risk of death and recurrence in the
group of patients treated with TP, but not PC (DNA-damaging agents only). Higher
associations were found for overexpression of the short CRNDE splice variant
(FJ466686): HR 6.072, 95% CI 1.814–20.32, p = 0.003 (the risk of death); HR 15.53,
95% CI 3.812–63.28, p < 0.001 (the risk of recurrence). Additionally, accumulation
of the TP53 protein correlated with decreased expression of both CRNDE transcripts
in tumor cells. Our results depict CRNDE as a potential marker of poor prognosis in
women with ovarian carcinomas, and suggest that its significance depends on the
therapeutic regimen used.

several (and the most strongest) potential prognostic
factors in ovarian cancer patients [3]. Members of our
group have established complete sequences of two new
CRNDE transcripts (FJ466685 and FJ466686, published in
GenBank in 2008) by using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE
kit (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (see supplementary
data and Figures S1–S4 in the Supplement). One of the first
published studies on CRNDE was an in silico experiment
that used the boolean-based systems biology approach
to predict novel genes associated with colorectal cancer

INTRODUCTION
The CRNDE (Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially
Expressed, formerly known as LOC388279 or
LOC643911) gene is located to the long arm of
chromosome 16 (16q12.2) in human. Until recently,
CRNDE had been treated as a long non-coding RNA
(lncRNA)-coding gene [1], though we have lately
identified its protein product, CRNDEP [2]. Our interest
in this gene started from its identification as one of

[4]. The researchers identified CRNDE as the gene highly
upregulated (FC = 16) in colon cancer compared with
the normal colonic mucosa. Additionally, some in vitro
studies showed that CRNDE is overexpressed in colorectal
carcinomas and other solid tumors and leukemias [5]. The
authors also presented preliminary results showing that
the level of CRNDE lncRNAs in patients’ blood plasma
increased specifically at early stages of colon cancer
development. Accordingly, it was recently discovered that
CRNDE may promote growth and invasion of glioma cells
both in vitro and in vivo [6, 7]. We have shown that the
CRNDEP peptide localizes predominantly to the nucleus
and its expression is elevated in highly proliferating tissues
[2]. All these findings make the CRNDE gene a promising
candidate for a new biomarker of carcinogenesis.
Here, we aimed to elucidate how the expression
of the two CRNDE transcripts identified by our team
affects ovarian cancer prognosis in patients treated with
two different chemotherapy regimens. Another aspect
of this study was to analyze CRNDE expression with
respect to TP53 accumulation status in the nuclei of tumor
cells. TP53 accumulation is one of the most frequently
observed aberrations in ovarian carcinomas; it occurs
as a result of TP53 gene alterations that affect TP53
transactivation capabilities (mainly missense mutations)
[8]. This phenomenon is predominantly due to the lack of
TP53 degradation in proteasomes. Mutant TP53 exerts a
dominant-negative effect on the wild-type TP53, leading
to a complete loss of the TP53 function [9]. Several
studies on cell lines have shown that the levels of different
proteins depend on the function or level of the TP53
protein. In addition, the results obtained in recent years by
our group suggest that the TP53 accumulation status may
influence the clinical importance of other molecular factors
[10–12]. Remarkably, this is the first study investigating a
clinical importance of the CRNDE gene in cancer patients.

was observed for both CRNDE-specific probe sets
available in this microarray, 238021_s_at and 238022_at.
A subsequent multivariate Cox analysis performed in the
microarray group (N  = 37), as well as in an adequate
independent validation group (N = 66), confirmed the
microarray outcome (see Table S2). The same statistical
inference was conducted in the merged TP-treated group
of 103 tumors, and the results turned out to be more
significant than in either of the subgroups (see Table 1).
This analysis also showed a negative impact of CRNDE
overexpression on disease-free survival of patients.
Remarkably, the outcome obtained for the joined
platinum/cyclophosphamide (PC) and TP-treated groups
was, in general, less significant than for the TP-treated
group only. This accorded with the lack of significant
results in the univariate Cox analysis performed for the
PC-treated group (data not shown).
The clinical importance of overexpressing the
short CRNDE splice variant (FJ466686) was particularly
visible with regard to the risk of death (HR 6.072, 95%
CI 1.814–20.32, p = 0.003) and recurrence (HR 15.53,
95% CI 3.812–63.28, p < 0.001) in all TP-treated patients
analyzed (see Table 1).
The results obtained for the longer splice variant of
CRNDE (FJ466685) remained in accordance with those
obtained for the shorter one, showing the negative impact
of CRNDE overexpression on overall survival (HR 6.908,
CI 1.749–27.28, p = 0.006) and disease-free survival (HR
8.760, CI 2.034–37.73, p = 0.004) in the TP-treated group.
However, the associations with clinical endpoints were
less noticeable for the longer transcript than for the shorter
one. Exemplary results are depicted in Figure 1.
Some clinical associations of CRNDE appeared to
be dependent on the TP53 accumulation status, which was
particularly visible in the validation group (see Table S2),
nevertheless, the difference could also be due to unequal
sizes of subgroups. We discovered a statistically significant
correlation between accumulation of the TP53 protein and
the decreased expression of both CRNDE transcripts in
ovarian carcinomas (Mann-Whitney U test p = 0.0369, and
p = 0.0069, for the short and long transcript, respectively,
see Figure 2C–2D).
We did not find any associations between CRNDE
expression and the following clinicopathological
parameters: patient’s age, histological grade and type of a
tumor, and the FIGO stage.
Lastly, we have also compared the results of CRNDE
expression profiling obtained with gene expression
microarrays and Real-Time qPCR, and calculated the
Pearson correlation coefficients between them. The high
correlation coefficients (ranging from 0.784 to 0.803)
in combination with low p-values < 0.0001 suggest that
both aforementioned methods produced highly similar
outcomes, which indirectly corroborates reliability of the
results presented above (see Figure 2A–2B).

RESULTS
Evaluation of the clinical importance of the
CRNDE gene by gene expression microarrays,
and further confirmation with real-time qPCR
The CRNDE gene was chosen for evaluation
of its prognostic value based on the results of our
analysis of gene expression microarray data that are
publicly available in the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) database (accession number GSE63885). This
microarray study revealed a strong negative impact
of CRNDE expression on overall survival of ovarian
cancer patients treated with the taxane/platinum (TP)
regimen (see Table S1 in the Supplement). With FC
values exceeding 5, CRNDE was the most prominent
prognostic marker in that group and in its subgroup
with TP53 accumulation. Moreover, this association

Identification of other possible splice variants of

samples derived from normal endometrium (NE), ovarian
cancer (OC) and HeLa cells (He). In this study, 7 sets
of primers were used (see Figure 3B–3C and Table S3).
The CRNDEv1F primer was specific to the NR_034105
and NR_110453 sequences, whereas CRNDEv2F should
hybridize to the NR_034106 and NR_110454 transcripts
only. The expected length of PCR products, depending
on the primer set used and the CRNDE splice variant, is
shown in Figure 3C. Although the overall band pattern
was in step with our earlier predictions in silico, some
unexpected bands (marked with ellipses) emerged

Four reference CRNDE transcripts, NR_034105,
NR_034106, NR_110453, and NR_110454 are spliced
differently than the transcripts identified in our study (see
Figure 3A). This may suggest that CRNDE pre-RNA is
processed in many ways, depending on, e.g., a tissue type.
As a result, a variety of distinct CRNDE RNAs could
exist in different tissues. To verify this hypothesis, we
carried out an additional PCR experiment on three cDNA

in a tissue-dependent manner. On the contrary, some
other bands, specific to the 5′ end of the NR_034105
and NR_110453 transcripts did not appear in the gel,
suggesting the lack of these splice variants in the analyzed
tissues. Remarkably, the FJ466686 (shorter) transcript
described herein, seemed to be present in all three samples
evaluated (see double bands in Figure 3B). Accordingly,
we have recently proven the prevalence of this CRNDEPcoding splice variant by measuring and comparing its
expression between 21 normal human tissue sets [2].

during cell division. In qPCR experiments, we investigated
the expression of two different splice variants of the
CRNDE gene. The longer variant (FJ466685) contains
83 additional nucleotides in exon 5. Their absence in the
shorter variant (FJ466686) leads to a formation of a new
ORF, which encodes the 84 amino acid-peptide CRNDEP,
recently described by our group as overexpressed in
highly proliferating tissues [2]. This observation is
concordant with the hypothesis by Ellis et al. [13], that
CRNDE may be a target of the MYC regulatory pathway,
being associated with the cell cycle progression and
malignant transformation [14]. Interestingly, our clinical
results obtained for the shorter splice variant (FJ466686,
CRNDEP-coding) were statistically more significant than
those for the longer one, which may imply that the former
variant exhibits a higher biological activity.
The clinical importance of CRNDE expression
was best visible in all TP-treated patients than in either
the microarray or validation subgroup. This was likely
due to the relatively small size of both subgroups.
Nevertheless, we obtained consistent and statistically

DISCUSSION
Herein, by performing microarray and Real-Time
qPCR studies, we have shown that the elevated level
of CRNDE transcripts significantly increases the risk
of death and recurrence in ovarian cancer patients. This
association was observed predominantly in patients treated
with taxanes (and not in the group treated with DNAdamaging agents only), which may be a hint that this gene
is somehow involved in the metabolism of microtubules

significant results for all three sample sets (see Tables 1
and S2), and the overall clinical effect seemed to be
additive. These results were obtained in the multivariate
Cox analysis, which strongly supports the hypothesis that
CRNDE overexpression may be an independent, negative
prognostic factor in ovarian carcinogenesis. Furthermore,
the clinical significance of this novel marker seems to
hinge on the therapeutic regimen used.
In accordance with our results, other researchers
reported CRNDE overexpression in more than 90%
of colorectal adenocarcinomas [5]. The authors also
suggested that CRNDE may be a promising tissue and
plasma biomarker in this cancer. Noteworthy, both
splice variants identified by our team were shown by
Graham et al. [5] to be highly elevated in adenomas and
adenocarcinomas, but not in the normal colonic tissue.
The same team reported in another article [13] that
CRNDE may be involved in development of cancers in
the variety of tissues and organs, like: colon, liver, kidney,

pancreas, prostate, ovary, blood and brain. Based on some
preliminary knock-in and knock-down experiments, the
authors concluded that CRNDE transcripts can promote
carcinogenesis by stimulating cell growth and suppressing
apoptosis. The rise of CRNDE levels during cancer
development may be due to the alterations in upstream
signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase pathway.
Recently, the same authors reported the existence of
a few nuclear, intronic CRNDE transcripts, and found
the association between expression of one of such
transcripts (called gVC-In4) and the insulin/insulin-like
growth factor (IGF) signaling. This mechanism seemed
to depend on the activation of both the PI3K and MAPK
pathways [15]. Accordingly, it was recently discovered
that overexpression of the CRNDE gene may suppress
apoptosis and promote growth and invasion of gliomas
both in vitro and in vivo either in a manner depending on
the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [6]
or by inhibiting the expression of the tumor-suppressing

miR-186 [7]. In line with this, Chen et al. [16] reported
abundant expression of CRNDE in recurrent gliomas. All
these results support our findings described herein.
We have previously shown on large groups of
patients that the TP53 accumulation status determined the

clinical significance of altered expression of some genes,
like BAX, BCL2 or ERBB2, and polymorphisms in others
(AR, FSHR) in ovarian cancer patients [10, 11, 17, 18].
This idea is based on the assumption, and some facts from
studies on cell lines, that mutant TP53, in contrast to the

wt protein, creates a “permissive” environment for action
of oncogenes [19, 20]. However, this was not apparent
with regard to the CRNDE gene. Concomitantly, the RealTime qPCR results presented here imply an association
between TP53 accumulation and lower CRNDE
expression. In accordance with this observation, Ellis et al.
[13] proposed that the CRNDE and IRX5 genes may share
the same bidirectional promoter, whereas the expression of
IRX5 was shown to negatively correlate with mutant TP53
protein levels in LNCaP prostate cancer cells [21].
Finally, we want to present some considerations
related to the methodical part of the study. In order to
achieve the highest possible specificity and sensitivity
of the qPCR study, we designed and tested our TaqMan
assays as recommended by PE Biosystems [22]. One of
the most important factors that could potentially affect the
expression analysis was the presence of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regions, where the CRNDEspecific primers and the TaqMan probe bind. According
to the NCBI dbSNP database, there are no SNPs in the
sequences recognized by two primers, LOCrtF and
LOCrt35R (see Table S3). By contrast, the LOCrt4wR
primer binds to a region, where one SNP, rs575423185, has
been identified in the 1000 Genomes Project [23]. The Minor
Allele Frequency (MAF) of this SNP in the default global
population equals 0.04%. The CRNDE-specific TaqMan
probe, that we designed, lies within a region with three
known SNPs, rs572170005, rs192990372, and rs141935748.
Their frequencies in the default global population equal
0.02%, 0.06% and 0.42%, respectively. This means that the
probability of being a carrier of the most frequent of these
SNPs (rs141935748) in at least one allele is approximately

0.0042^2 + 2*0.0042*(1 – 0.0042) ≈ 0.0084. In other words,
one of about 119 (1/0.0084) individuals is a carrier of this
SNP in the default global population. Considering that the
analyzed group in our Real-Time qPCR study consisted of
135 ovarian cancer patients, it is highly probable that only
one tumor harbored the rs141935748 polymorphism, which
should not affect the CRNDE expression profiling in the
entire group. The 3 other SNPs mentioned above are much
less frequently distributed in the default global population, so
they are likely absent in our group of ovarian cancer patients.
As to the specificity of our TaqMan assays,
they were designed in such a way to allow specific
discrimination between the CRNDEP-coding (FJ466686)
and other CRNDEP-non-coding transcripts, e.g. FJ466685.
This goal was achieved by using the LOCrt35R reverse
primer, specific to the CRNDEP-coding transcript only.
By contrast, the LOCrtF universal forward primer as well
as the TaqMan probe did not discriminate the CRNDE
transcripts (see Figure 4), whereas the LOCrt4wR primer
was able to detect the FJ466685 splice variant as well as
all reference transcripts except one, NR_110454. Thus, our
qPCR results for the CRNDEP-coding transcript are fully
specific, while the results for the longer CRNDE splice
variant, FJ466685, are, in fact, the sum of expression for
several transcripts. This is worth noting in light of the
findings by Graham et al. [5], who showed that CRNDE
transcripts are differentially expressed in colorectal
cancer. Nevertheless, all splice variants detected by our
TaqMan assays were upregulated in that neoplasm, which
is consistent with the results shown herein.
As to the diversity of CRNDE transcripts in human
cells, in July 2015, there were 12 different CRNDE

region within exon 5 was depicted with dashed lines. The presence of this region leads to a disruption of 84aa ORF encoding the CRNDEP
peptide. Red arrows represent primer sequences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

mRNAs collected in the AceView database, the length
of which ranged from 101 bp (FN117285, identified in
breast carcinoma) to 2221 bp (the variant reconstructed
from 25 cDNA clones originating from various normal
and cancerous tissues). Here, we compared the splice
variants described by us with four reference transcripts,
NR_034105, NR_034106, NR_110453, and NR_110454.
Although our CRNDE transcripts were capped and
polyadenylated, which suggested their completeness, the
alignment showed that they were shorter on both ends
than the reference sequences. The boundaries of exons
1a and 1b described by Graham et al. [5] represent the
most external transcription initiation sites, however, the
most common initiation sites are located nearer the 3′ ends
of these exons. Accordingly, the 5′ end of the transcripts
cloned by our group was among those mapped by 5′ RACE
in colorectal cancer cell lines by Graham et al. [5]. As to
the 3′ end of CRNDE transcripts, the polyadenylation site
identified by our group was also the one, which was the
most commonly observed by Graham et al., though in the
reference sequences the most external polyadenylation
site was indicated [5]. Consistently, one of our bacterial
clones, harboring the products of 3′ RACE for CRNDE,
had the 3′ UTR longer by 5 bases than the others, (see
Figure S1). Moreover, the presence of unexpected PCR
products in Figure 3B suggests that some CRNDE
transcripts in normal endometrium and ovarian cancer
cells are likely spliced in a different, currently undescribed
way. This supports the hypothesis that in these cells
alternative termination of transcription may occur, just like
in colorectal cancer cells investigated by Graham et al.
[5]. Similarly, the 5′ UTRs of our transcripts may also be
longer, considering the positive PCR results with the use
of the CRNDEv2F primer (see Figure 3). This fact implies
that CRNDE transcription in normal endometrium, ovarian
cancer and HeLa cells starts at different initiation sites.
Remarkably, we did not obtain expected PCR products
for normal endometrium and ovarian cancer when using
the CRNDEv1F primer, specific to exon 1a. The lack of
amplification may suggest that transcripts containing this
particular exon are not expressed in these tissues. On the
other hand, the CRNDEv1F primer binds upstream of
the main start sites identified by Graham et al. [5], so the
existence of transcripts starting nearer the 3′ end of exon
1a cannot be excluded.
In summary, CRNDE seems to play a prominent
role in carcinogenesis. While this study is the first
demonstration of the clinical importance of CRNDE
in cancer patients, other researchers also reported its
oncogenic role in gliomas [6, 7, 16] and other solid tumors
and leukemias [13]. Furthermore, CRNDE transcripts were
implied to be of potential use as sensitive and specific
molecular markers of early carcinogenesis in colon cancer
[5]. With all this considered, this gene is likely to become
in the future an important marker of cancer development
or even a target for therapy.

Patients and tumors
The first step of our study was the cDNA
microarray-based evaluation of gene expression carried
out in groups of 32 and 37 frozen tumor samples from
ovarian cancer patients who underwent the cisplatin/
cyclophosphamide (PC) or taxane/cisplatin (TP)
treatment (see Table 2 for a detailed clinicopathological
characteristics). Noteworthy, the microarray subgroup
was selected from a larger tumor collection in such a
way to minimize the influence of clinical factors on
patients’ outcome. In other words, this group comprised
the patients who had a good prognosis despite a large
residual tumor (being a strong, negative prognostic
factor), and vice versa. Next, we used Real-Time qPCR to
verify these results in the same group of tumors. We also
evaluated the clinical importance of CRNDE expression
on 66 previously untested ovarian tumors from patients
treated with TP, which gives 135 frozen tumor samples
in total. All of them were collected prior to the chemical
treatment in the Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland
in years 1995–2010. Medical records of all patients
were critically reviewed by at least two clinicians. The
material was carefully selected to meet the following
criteria: no chemotherapy before staging laparotomy,
adequate staging procedure, International Federation of
Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) stage IIB to
IV disease [24], tumor tissue from the first laparotomy
available, moderate or poor tumor differentiation,
availability of clinical data including residual tumor size
and follow-up.
All
tumors
were
uniformly
reviewed
histopathologically, classified according to the criteria
of  the World Health Organization [25] and graded in
a four-grade scale, in compliance with the standards
given by Barber et al. [26]. Additionally, a complete
evaluation of TP53 status has been performed using the
PAb1801 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:500, SigmaGenosys, Cambridge, UK), as described previously [10].
Accumulation of TP53 in immunohistochemical staining
results predominantly from missense mutations (they
account for about 67% of all TP53 alterations). In case
of other mutations in the gene and when no alterations
occur, accumulation of the TP53 protein is not observed
[27]. From among 135 specimens that we examined, the
TP53 accumulation occurred in 86 tumors (63.7%), while
49 tumors (36.3%) were TP53-negative.
As to the evaluation of clinical endpoints, complete
remission (CR) was defined as disappearance of all
clinical and biochemical symptoms of ovarian cancer
evaluated after completion of the first-line chemotherapy
and confirmed four weeks later [28]. Disease-free
survival (DFS) time was assessed only for patients who
achieved complete remission. For the PC-treated group,
43906

Oncotarget

Development of two TaqMan assays for two
different splice variants of CRNDE

the follow-up time ranged from 104 to 3750 days (the
median equaled 1165.5 days); the respective values for
the TP-treated group were 296 and 5630 days (with the
median of 1105 days). All surviving patients had at least a
6-month follow-up.

Two different sets of primers (LOCrtF, LOCrt35R)
and (LOCrtF, LOCrt4wR) as well as one TaqMan probe
were designed and tested, according to PE Biosystems’
recommendations. These assays were able to specifically
detect either the short or the long splice variant of CRNDE
(see Figure S5), though the same TaqMan probe (27 bp)
was utilized in both cases. This was achieved by using
either the LOCrt35R or LOCrt4wR reverse primer. The
former primer spanned a junction between exon 4 and the
shorter splice variant of exon 5, which made it specific to
the FJ466686 transcript. On the contrary, the LOCrt4wR
primer was fully homologous to exon 5 in a region
present in FJ466685 and absent in the FJ466686 transcript
(see Figure 4). The genomic sequence of CRNDE was
undetectable by both primer sets due to the presence of
large introns (> 4 kb) between the amplified exons.
Both personally designed TaqMan assays specific
to the CRNDE gene were thoroughly tested before
use, as suggested by PE Biosystems [22], to ensure the
best specificity and performance of Real-Time qPCR.
Results of the specificity tests are presented in Figure S5,
whereas the performance of each assay equaled about
100% (assessed based on a slope of the standard curve).
In addition, the correctness of both Real-Time qPCR
products was confirmed by DNA sequencing with the use
of BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life
Technologies).

RNA extraction followed by the assessment of its
quantity and quality
RNA was isolated from frozen tumor sections
with stromal cell contamination (scc) lower than 15%
utilizing the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). RNA quantity was measured with NanoDrop
specrophotometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), and its quality was assessed on Agilent
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA). RNA integrity numbers (RINs) of the samples
ranged from 6.5 to 9.4.

A microarray analysis of gene expression
Hybridizations were carried out as described by
Lisowska et al., [29]. Briefly, double-stranded cDNA
was synthesized with Reverse Transcriptase II (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using 8 μg of
total RNA as a template. Obtained cDNA (16 μg) was
then used for the synthesis of biotinylated cRNA with
the BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling
Kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA).
Both cDNA and cRNA were purified with GeneChip
Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). Fragmented cRNA was hybridized first
to the Affymetrix control Test3 Array, and then, after
evaluating the samples’ quality, to the Human Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) for 16 h at 45°C. The
microarrays were stained, washed, and subsequently
scanned with GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix).
Data were  acquired using the GCOS 1.2  software
(Affymetrix).

Real-time qPCR-based studies of gene
expression
Gene expression data obtained from cDNA
microarrays were further verified by Real-Time qPCR.
This study was performed not only in the microarray
group, but also on another set of 66 previously untested
ovarian tumors (so-called the validation group) in order
to confirm a clinical significance of the results. All
Real-Time qPCR experiments described here were run
in triplicates on the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Life Technologies), using HGPRT as a reference gene.
Gene expression was evaluated with TaqMan assays,
CRNDE-specific (6-FAM-labeled, personally designed)
and HGPRT-specific (VIC-labeled, Life Technologies,
assay id: 4326321E). All qPCR experiments were carried
out as standard singleplex reactions in the volume of 10 μl
using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix with uracil
N-glycosylase (Life Technologies) and about 20 ng of
total RNA, earlier reverse transcribed to cDNA with the
High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life
Technologies). The expression of CRNDE was normalized
to HGPRT and relatively quantified using the delta-deltaCT algorithm [30].

PCR experiments
All polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were run on
cDNA using the AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Life
Technologies). They consisted of the following steps:
95°C for 10 min. (hot start of the polymerase), 95°C for
30 sec. (DNA denaturation), 55°C for 30 sec. (primers
annealing), 72°C for 1 min. (the PCR product elongation),
72°C for 7 min. (final elongation of the product), 4°C
hold. DNA denaturation, primers annealing and product
elongation steps were repeated consecutively 35 times.
The ND (no-DNA) sample was used as a negative
reference in every PCR reaction. Sequences of all PCR
primers are shown in Table S3.

The reference gene used in this study, HGPRT, was
nominated from among 11 genes included on TaqMan
Human Endogenous Control Plates (Life Technologies),
because it was characterized by the most stable expression
in both the PC- and TP-treated groups. Expression of the
reference genes was assessed for 8 randomly selected
tumors from each group. Then, the stability was calculated
with the qBasePLUS software (Biogazelle NV, Zwijnaarde,
Belgium), utilizing an improved version of the geNorm
algorithm [31, 32].

continuous variables, the same interpretation applies to a
unit difference [35]. In our study, a tumor exhibiting the
highest expression of each CRNDE transcript was used as
a calibrator. Thus, all the expression values ranged from
0 to 1. This approach allowed for approximate estimation
of the risk of death and recurrence based on the hazard
ratio (HR) values in a similar way as for categorical
variables. However, it has to be stressed that the real HR
will always be lower from what is shown in Tables 1 and
S2, because only one tumor (calibrator) has the CRNDE
expression equaling 1, and none – equaling 0.

Statistical analyses of gene expression data

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Microarray data were subjected to a statistical
analysis utilizing the GC-RMA algorithm [33]. Further
noise reduction was achieved by the elimination of the
least significant principal components. Quality control
parameters were based on MAS5.0-extracted information,
using thresholds suggested by Affymetrix [34]. Internal
consistency of the data sets was also tested using the
principal component analysis (PCA). A selection of
differentially expressed genes was carried out using
the resampling-based test with t statistics. Probe sets with
p-values ≤ 0.001 and fold change (FC) values ≥1.5 were
considered significantly changed.
A prognostic value of the data obtained in
microarray and qPCR experiments was further verified
using the stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards
model. In this analysis, the following 6 variables were
taken into account: gene expression level, patient’s age
(categorized by median split); residual tumor size; clinical
stage (FIGO); histological grade (the last three parameters
were categorized as shown in Table 2) and histological
type (categorization: serous vs non-serous types). The
survival analyses were performed not only in the entire
group of tumors, but also in subgroups with and without
accumulation of TP53. Since the PC-treated group was
too small for a multivariate analysis, the univariate Cox
proportional hazards model was applied to it. In addition,
we conducted the statistical inference in the joined
PC+TP-treated groups to find out whether the outcome
depends on the therapeutic regimen used, and if this effect
is additive or subtractive.
The association of CRNDE expression with either
clinicopathological parameters or the TP53 status in the
tumors was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test or
the Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively, depending whether
the nominal variable had two or more categories.
Herein, the expression of CRNDE was always
treated as a continuous variable to avoid arbitrary
categorization of data, which could potentially lead to
falsification of statistical results. It is worth noting that, in
case of continuous variables, HRs cannot be treated as the
ratio of the hazard rates, corresponding to the conditions
described by two sets of explanatory variables (as for
categorical variables), because these sets do not exist. For
