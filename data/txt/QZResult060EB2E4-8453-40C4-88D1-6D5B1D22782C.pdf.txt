ABSTRACT
The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a crucial role in influencing cell fate
decisions in response to cellular stress. As p53 elicits cell cycle arrest, senescence
or apoptosis, the integrity of the p53 pathway is considered a key determinant of
anti-tumor responses. p53 can also promote autophagy, however the role of p53dependent autophagy in chemosensitivity is poorly understood. VMY-1-103 (VMY),
a dansylated analog of purvalanol B, displays rapid and potent anti-tumor activities,
however the pathways by which VMY works are not fully defined. Using established
prostate cancer cell lines and novel conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) derived
from prostate cancer patients; we have defined the mechanisms of VMY-induced
prostate cancer cell death. Herein, we show that the cytotoxic effects of VMY required
a p53-dependent induction of autophagy, and that inhibition of autophagy abrogated
VMY-induced cell death. Cancer cell lines harboring p53 missense mutations evaded
VMY toxicity and treatment with a small molecule compound that restores p53 activity
re-established VMY-induced cell death. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms
governing VMY-dependent cell death in cell lines, and importantly in CRCs, provides
the rationale for clinical studies of VMY, alone or in combination with p53 reactivating
compounds, in human prostate cancer.

tumor therapy and may contribute to disease progression
and recurrence. Several studies suggest, however, that
apoptosis per se is the not only, or even the predominant,
mechanism of cell death during chemotherapy [1-4].

Among the alternative mechanisms, autophagy, either
concomitantly with- or independently- of apoptosis,
is emerging as an important pro-cell death, anti-tumor
pathway.
Autophagy is a degradative process by which
damaged cellular organelles and abnormally folded
proteins are cleared via the lysosome [5-7]. Autophagy
may participate in either tumor suppressive or
collaborative oncogenic signaling [8, 9]. In normal
tissues and in many tumor cells, autophagy enables
adaptation during nutritional stress via the degradation
of macromolecules and intracellular organelles, thereby
promoting cancer cell proliferation. In contrast, the
impairment of autophagy can promote malignant
transformation, as the mono-allelic deletion of Beclin-1
or loss of heterozygosity of several autophagic genes
occurs in human tumors [5, 10, 11]. Multiple myeloma
cells succumb to excessive autophagic activation triggered
by inhibition of caspase 10 [12] and, we have shown
that autophagy induced by glucose restriction [13] or by
inhibitors of the mitochondrial transporter SLC25A1/CIC
[14] can be directly responsible for cell death.
The activity of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is
induced by a broad array of cell stressors including DNAdamaging chemotherapeutic drugs and can be an excellent
target for therapeutic intervention [15]. While the role of
p53 in regulating apoptosis is well documented, various
lines of evidence suggest that p53 and autophagy are
also closely connected, although in a complex and at
times conflicting manner. Pharmacological inhibition or
ablation of p53 can enhance autophagy during nutrient
stress and hypoxia [8], contributing to cell survival [16].
However, autophagy stabilizes p53 [17], resulting in a
feed-forward activation of p53-dependent autophagy
and cell death following DNA damage. p53 can also
induce autophagy via inhibiting mTOR (reviewed in [18,
19]). Understanding the role of p53 to either induce or
inhibit autophagy is important in determining therapeutic
outcomes and based on these and other studies, we and
others have proposed that autophagy contributes to the
ability of p53 to eliminate cells that have been exposed
to genotoxic stressors, preserving cellular and genomic
integrity [9, 20, 21].
One obstacle to the development of new prostate
cancer therapeutics has been the inability to establish
sustained cultures of primary normal prostate and prostate
cancer cells derived from patients. We have developed
a novel culture methodology, termed “conditional
reprogrammed cells” (termed CRCs), that provides an
epithelial cell culture environment that facilitates the
bypassing of replicative senescence, with the epithelial
cells becoming reversibly immortalized without detectable
cell crisis [22-25]. The ability to rapidly generate primary
human cell cultures provides a unique opportunity to
define the genetic and molecular basis of prostate cancer
and to establish a framework for the personalization of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapy. This unique approach has been integrated into the
present study.
The in vitro [26-28] and in vivo [29] anti-tumor
activities of a novel CDK inhibitor, VMY-1-103 (VMY),
were previously described, and VMY induces p53 activity
and apoptosis in the wild type p53 prostate cancer cell line,
LNCaP [26]. In the present study, we sought to define the
molecular and genetic mechanisms of VMY-induced cell
death. Herein we show that both prostate cancer (PCa) cell
lines and primary prostate cancer CRCs with wild-type
p53, were highly sensitive to VMY-induced cell death and
occurred via the activation of macro-autophagy. p53 null
or p53 mutant cell lines were insensitive to VMY-induced
cytotoxicity. Furthermore, although p53 mutant expressing
cells were resistant to VMY cytotoxicity, co-treatment
of these cell lines with the p53-reactivating compound
PRIMA-1, which restores wild-type p53 activity, resensitized these otherwise resistant cells to VMY-induced
cell death. Mutation of the p53 gene occurs relatively
infrequently (20%) in early stage prostate cancers but
increases significantly in late stage and metastatic PCa
[30]. Given that small molecules that reactivate mutant
p53 are currently in clinical trials, we propose that VMY
in combination with such reactivating molecules may
provide a potentially effective cancer therapeutic in both
the early and late stages of PCa.

RESULTS
VMY induces cell death in p53 wild-type cancer
cell lines
To further clarify whether wild-type p53 is required
for VMY-induced cell death, we interrogated cell lines
derived from a distinct tissue types and differing in p53
status. VMY induced a G2/M arrest as assessed by flow
cytometry, regardless of p53 status (Fig. 1A), indicating
that this compound affects the cell cycle in a p53independent manner. Many cells lacking functional p53
retain the capability to arrest in G2/M [31]. In contrast,
the percentage of cells detected in the subG1 phase of the
cell cycle, indicative of apoptosis, was higher in all of the
cell lines harboring wild-type p53 versus cells with a p53
-null or -mutant genotype. LNCaP and MCF7 and DU145
and PC3 were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively [26, 32]. Consistent with our previous data
[26], VMY induced wild-type, but not mutant, p53 protein
levels across multiple cell lines and tissue types (Fig. 1B),
which correlated with VMY-induced subG1 content (Fig.
1A).
Using flow cytometry, early apoptosis was measured
by annexin V immunostaining. Propidium iodide (PI)
positive, necrotic cells were excluded from these analyses.
The basal levels of annexin V were uniformly higher in

the p53 wild-type cells versus p53-null or p53-mutant cell
lines. Treatment with VMY increased annexin positivity
in p53 wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, wild-type p53
appears to be an important transducer of VMY's effects
on apoptosis.

using expression vectors for WT p53 or the previously
characterized gain of function p53 mutation, p53-G245A,
[13, 33] (Fig. 3A). The expression of wild-type p53
decreased slightly the percent cell death in the presence
of DMSO while mutant p53 expression had no effect.
Consistent with our previous data (reference 26 and Fig.
2), we found that p53 negative PC3 cells are insensitive to
VMY-induced cell death. Most importantly, the expression
of wild-type p53 but not the p53-G245A mutant restored
VMY sensitivity in these cells, leading to a progressive
and dose dependent increase in the subG1 population.
These results firmly establish wild-type p53 as a key
effector of VMY-induced cytotoxicity

Wild-type p53 is necessary for VMY-induced cell
death
To determine the role of p53 in VMY-induced cell
death, an isogenic cellular system was established by
using an adenoviral vector expressing p53shRNA to knock
down p53 protein levels in LNCaP cells. As expected the
p53-shRNA led to an approximate 50% reduction in p53
protein levels relative to control vector cells (Fig. 2A).
Additionally, p53 knockdown significantly inhibited
(p<0.01) the cell death-promoting activity of VMY as
measured by flow cytometry, and nearly completely
abrogated PARP cleavage induced by this compound (Fig.
2B).
We next assessed the effects of expressing wildtype p53 or p53 mutants in an isogenic cellular system,
thus overcoming possible differences in the genetic
background. The most common p53 mutations are
missense mutations occurring in the DNA binding
domain and include several “hot spot” codons, including
R175, G245, R248, and R273. We performed transient
transfection experiments in the p53-null PC3 cells

Compounds that rescue wild-type activity of
mutant p53 proteins restore sensitivity to VMY
Several small molecules including PRIMA-1 have
been developed that are capable of restoring the wildtype conformation and function of mutant p53 proteins.
PRIMA-1 acts via the formation of adducts with thiols
contained within p53 that can rescue the biological activity
of mutant forms of p53 [34]. We therefore determined
whether PRIMA-1 could restore sensitivity to VMY in
mutant p53 PCa cells. Treatment of the mutant p53P223L/
V274F
DU145 human prostate cancer cell line with either
VMY or PRIMA-1 alone showed only modest expression
of the known down-stream p53 target gene, p21CIP1/WAF1,

while co-treatment with both PRIMA-1 and VMY led to
the induction of p21CIP1/WAF1, without affecting the total p53
expression levels, thus demonstrating restoration of p53
activity by PRIMA-1 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, co-treatment
with PRIMA-1 and VMY significantly increased cell death
(Fig. 3C) and induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 3D) versus
either PRIMA-1 or VMY alone. All extracts were run on
the same gel and the image is from one representative
autoradiogram. PRIMA-1 treatment alone did not
significantly affect sensitivity to VMY in either LNCaP
(p53wt) or PC3 (p53-null) cells (Supplemental Fig. S1),
thus demonstrating the specificity of this compound in
restoring VMY-mediated cell death to mutant p53 prostate
cancer cells.

of the cells being AO positive, with an average of 10 AO
puncta dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A),
thus demonstrating that VMY induces autophagosome
formation. In contrast, in the few DU145 and PC3 cells
that were AO positive (approximately 1%), on average
only one AO puncta per cell was observed in DU145 cells
and an average of two AO puncta were seen in PC3 cells
(Fig. 5A)
We next studied the pattern of subcellular
localization of LC3-I (microtubule-associated protein
1 light chain 3), which becomes lipidated by the class
III phosphoinositide 3-kinase Vps34 when autophagy
is activated and re-localizes from the microtubules to
autophagosomal membranes (reviewed in Kang, et al.
[35]). LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells were transiently
transfected with an LC3-GFP expression vector [36] and
subjected to fluorescence microscopy. VMY treatment
induced LC3-GFP re-localization and concentration into
prototypical autophagic puncta (Fig 5B, top right panel)
in 11% of the LNCaP cells (with approximately 5 puncta
per LC3 GFP positive cell) versus approximately 1% of
VMY treated DU145 or PC3 cells with approximately 1
puncta per LC3 GFP positive cell (Supplemental Fig. S2).
Treatment with VMY and 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), a
class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, resulted in
a loss of LC3-GFP puncta in LNCaP cells (Fig. 5B lower
left panel, average 0.8 puncta per cell) while chloroquine,
which inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes with the
lysosomes, lead to an increase in the number of positive
cells (20%) and an increase in the number of puncta per
cell (average of more than 8 puncta per cell) (Figure 5B,
lower right panel) while treatment of PC3 and DU145
cells these compounds had little effect (Supplemental Fig.
S3).
Besides influencing LC3I subcellular localization,

VMY induces autophagy in LNCaP cells
As inhibition of apoptosis with caspase 8 or 9
inhibitors failed to completely rescue VMY-induced cell
death in LNCaP cells, despite a significant reduction in
annexin V positivity (Fig. 4), we explored the role of
autophagy in VMY-induced cell death. Autophagy was
assessed by immuno-fluorescence and immuno-blot
assays. The fluorescent and lysosomotropic compound
Acridine Orange (AO) becomes protonated in the acidic
environment of lysosomes and autophagosomes when
autophagy is activated, resulting in its aggregation
and accumulation. Protonated AO is identifiable via
fluorescence microscopy as discrete aggregates that emit
fluorescence at 640 nm, versus fluorescence at 525 nm in
its native state. LNCaP cells were exposed to AO either
in the presence or absence of VMY. VMY treatment
resulted in the appearance of discrete acidic vesicles. We
found that VMY-treated LNCaP cells exhibited a stark
increase in discrete acidic vesicles with greater than 75%

cells

lipidation also alters LC3-1 electrophoretic mobility
and which is referred to as LC3-II. Treatment of LNCaP
cells with VMY for 24 hours resulted in an induction of
conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (Fig. 5C). Degradation of
the autophagic receptor sequestosome1/p62 [37], together
with its autophagic cargo, occurs via the lysosomes during
autophagy. Accordingly, treatment with VMY for 24 hrs
resulted in a decrease in p62 levels, (Fig. 5C). Collectively,
these data clearly suggest that treatment of LNCaP cells
with VMY results in an induction of autophagy.

A static assessment of LC3 conversion fails
to clearly indicate whether autophagy is inhibited or
activated. To investigate how VMY affects autophagic
flux [38], we performed dynamic kinetics experiments
where autophagic induction was studied as a function of
time following VMY treatment (Fig. 6). In the absence
of VMY, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II remained
relatively stable, with or without 3-MA, and increased
slightly after exposure to chloroquine (Supplemental Fig.
S3). This result strongly suggests that LNCAP cells have
a relatively low rate of basal autophagic flux, at least in
the absence of VMY. By contrast, treatment with VMY

VMY-induced autophagy is p53-dependent

resulted in a strong induction of LC3-II conversion, as
expected (see Fig 5 above), which was blocked by the
early autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (Fig. 6A,B (blue line)),
and was enhanced by chloroquine (Fig. 6A,B (red line).
Importantly, inhibition of autophagy led to an overall
reduction in cell death induced by VMY, as measured by
trypan blue dye exclusion (Fig. 6C), indicating that the
activation of autophagy is a central mechanism in VMYinduced cell death.

In order to establish whether p53 mediates VMYinduced autophagy, we infected LNCaP cells with a
previously validated p53 shRNA-expressing lentivirus
[39]. p53 shRNA led to an appreciable (greater than 60%)
reduction of p53 protein levels compared with vector
control (Fig. 7A). VMY failed to activate autophagy in
the p53 shRNA-transduced cells, as demonstrated by the

was performed at the times indicated in the presence or absence of the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine
(CQ). (A) Induction of autophagy was assessed following treatment with 30 uM VMY. (B) Quantification of normalized protein levels for
LC3-II conversion was performed using the protein expression data in DMSO control treated cells (see Supplemental Fig. S2), following
normalization to β-actin, allowing the effects of VMY and the independent effects of DMSO, 3-MA or CQ to be directly compared based
on the results seen in A. The data were plotted as fold change in LC3-II. (C) Effect of inhibition of autophagy on VMY-induced cell death.
The fold-increase in cell death induced by VMY in LNCaP cells in the presence or absence of 3-MA or chloroquine was quantified by
trypan blue dye exclusion (* p < 0.01, N=3).

lack of conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (Fig. 7A, arrow).
The knockdown of p53 reduced vesicular acidification
by VMY (Fig. 7B lower right panel) compared to vector
control cells (Fig. 7B upper right panel). Thus, p53
regulates autophagosome formation and functional p53
is required for VMY’s induction of autophagy in prostate
cancer cells.

We have recently reported on a novel cell culture
approach that conditionally induces an indefinite

[23-25, 40, 41], which are referred to as conditionally
reprogrammed cells (CRCs). Prostate cancer CRC lines
and their matched normal counterparts were established
from two Gleason’s grade 7 patients who underwent
radical prostatectomy at Massachusetts General Hospital
and Georgetown University Hospital. Exposure to

VMY for 18hrs established that the tumor CRCs were
significantly more sensitive to VMY-induced cell
death, compared to the patient-matched normal CRCs,
(Supplemental Fig. S4). Cell cycle progression and
apoptosis as measured by flow cytometry were also
affected (Supplemental Fig. S4). Robust increases in the
p53 protein levels were seen following VMY exposure
(Fig. 8A), and VMY induced the conversion of LC3I to
LC3II by 18hrs versus both early time points and DMSO
alone (Fig 8A). In addition, sequencing of the p53 DNA
binding domains of both CRC lines revealed no genetic
mutations, further confirming that the p53 genes were
indeed wild-type.
VMY also increased the protonated AO
fluorescence, with discrete vesicles being observed
throughout the cytoplasmic compartment in both
CRC lines (Fig. 8B and Supplemental Fig. S5), fully
recapitulating our observations in wild-type p53 LNCaP
cells. Therefore, to establish whether VMY induction of
p53 induces autophagy in prostate cancer CRCs, genetic
silencing of p53 by shRNA was next performed. Lentiviral
infection of the CRCs was carried out as described above
and transduction with the p53shRNA virus resulted in
significant reductions in p53 levels in the CRCs (Fig.
8C-left). LNCaP cells were used as a positive control for
p53 knockdown (Fig. 8C-right). The genetic silencing
of p53 by shRNA significantly reduced VMY-induced
vesicular acidification (Fig. 8D, upper right panel vs. lower
right panel). These results strongly indicate that the loss of
p53 abolishes VMY-induced autophagosome formation in
primary prostate cancer cells following treatment.
Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that
wild-type p53 is required for VMY-induced autophagy and
apoptosis in both transformed cell lines and in primary
prostate cancer cells and that VMY-induced cell death is
dependent upon p53-driven autophagy.

support p53 induction and both unchecked autophagy and
robust apoptosis will deliver increased curative effects.
We had previously reported that VMY induced both
p53 protein levels and phosphorylation on serine residues
15, 46 and 393, as well as increasing both p21CIP1/WAF1 levels
and PARP cleavage [26], suggesting that p53 activity may
transduce at least a component of VMY’s effects, however
this possibility was not directly addressed. Using genetic
and chemical approaches, we herein established that wildtype p53 plays an essential role in inducing both apoptosis
and autophagy in prostate cancer cells. While there is
known crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis, as
they share certain signaling pathways and proteins, the
mechanisms by which this bridging occurs have not been
fully defined. Furthermore, p53’s role in concurrently
regulating apoptosis and autophagy differs by cell type
and can be influenced by the type of stressor to which the
cell is exposed. For example, treatment of SiHa (cervical
cancer), A549 (lung) and MCF7 (breast) cancer cells
with docosahexaenoic acid resulted in autophagy via an
induction of AMPK and mTOR inhibition [46]. However
while inhibition of autophagy partially prevented the
apoptotic response, the loss of p53 was required [46]. In
contrast, we show that the induction of p53 by VMY was
a prerequisite for inducing both autophagy and apoptosis,
and that silencing p53 effectively blocked activation of
both pathways. While further studies will be required to
more fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated
with p53’s sensitivity to VMY, these studies underscore
the complexity of both p53’s role in regulating cellular
responses to treatment and highlight the importance that
the model system plays in both drug development and
predictive modeling of therapeutic responses.
The lack of clinically relevant cell lines has had a
major impact on effective therapeutic development [47,
48]. By combining detailed tissue collection and pathology
with our CRC technology [22-25, 40, 41], we generated
two wild-type p53 prostate CRC lines from Gleasons
score 7 patients. Since the mechanisms by which p53
bridges autophagy and apoptosis to induce cell death are
still not fully elucidated, these CRC cultures represent
important resources for the assessment of p53 activity in
non-transformed prostate cells. For example, we anticipate
that prostate cultures derived from local or distant
metastases will contain cells harboring mutant p53 genes
[30]. In addition, the establishment of isogenic cell lines
derived through the use of gene-targeting vectors and/or
viral delivery of shRNAs will allow for the modification
of single or multiple genes in either normal or tumor
CRCs with minimal impacts on their existing genetic
background. Since cultures of CRCs can be established
via single cell cloning from the primary tissue sample
(CA, XL, RS unpublished), the necessary tools now
exist for the in-depth study of p53 function in a highly
biologically relevant and patient-specific model system.
In addition, the CRC approach allows for the study of

DISCUSSION
Apoptosis and autophagy represent two complex and
partially overlapping mechanisms that are activated under
a variety of cell conditions, including chemotherapeutic
stress (see references [38, 42] among others), and where
p53 can play a significant regulatory role. For example,
the initiation of p53 and apoptosis by chemotherapeutic
drugs often results in cell death. Furthermore, while
we have recently discovered that autophagy is the key
pathways for degrading mutant p53 proteins [20], it is
autophagy per se that plays a central role in stabilizing
wild-type p53 following DNA damage [17]. Additionally,
autophagy-related proteins such as Beclin 1, ATG5 [19,
43] and Ambra1 [44] are not only targets of apoptosis
but also reciprocally influence apoptotic activity. And,
while controlled autophagy can function as a pro-survival
mechanism [45], unchecked autophagy can trigger cell
death. We predict therefore that compounds that can

inter- and intra- tumor heterogeneity with unprecedented
accuracy and detail and will hopefully form the working
basis for a more personalized approach to prostate cancer
therapy, analogous to the patient we successfully treated
for malignant recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, a life
threatening cancer of the airway epithelium [24].
In conclusion, we have identified a small moleculeinducible, p53-dependent link to the induction of
apoptosis, autophagy and cell death in prostate cancer
cells. Interestingly, the co-expression of the p53G245A
mutant protein in LNCaP cells failed to interfere with
VMY-induced cell death (CA, MA, LR data not shown),
suggesting that tumors that are heterozygous for mutant
p53 still retain VMY sensitivity. While VMY has not
been tested to date in humans, our mouse imaging studies
established that VMY (20 mg/kg given three times per
week for more than four weeks,) was both an effective
treatment for sporadic medulloblastoma and importantly
was well tolerated, with no signs of toxicity being found
[29]. Furthermore the straightforward mass spectrometrybased method we developed in that study for quantifying
systemic VMY delivery to tissues, including the prostate
[29], will be useful in facilitating future in vivo efficacy
and molecular mechanism studies using both engineered
mouse models and primary human tissue xenografts. Since
PRIMA-1 resensitized p53-mutant cells to VMY-induced
cell death, we conclude that this compound may be highly
effective in treating a broad array of cancers, including
those with p53 mutations. Finally, similar to our recent
studies [24, 41], the ability to now perform direct testing of
the efficacy of VMY as a monotherapy or in combination
with other drugs on individual patients cells may result in
more rapidly achievable and more accurate predictions of
a patient’s response to therapeutic intervention, resulting
in better outcomes and enhanced survivorship.

pathological analyses that documented that the tissue
sections collected were nearly exclusively tumor cells,
the specimens were processed via protease dissociation
as previously described [23]. Primary cultures were
established at Georgetown using the CRC method as
previously described [23]. For experimentation, the cells
were carried in conditioned media as described [25].
Briefly, irradiated J2 feeder cells were plated in 175 cm2
tissue culture flasks (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ)
in 30 mls of F media. The media was collected after three
days in culture and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 minutes at
4°C to remove cellular debris, followed by filtration using
a 0.22 µm Millex-GP filter unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
For cell culture, three volumes of conditioned F media was
mixed with one volume of fresh F medium and the final
working conditioned media was supplemented with 5 µM
Y-27632.

Flow cytometry
The prostate cells were fixed and stained with 20ug/
ml propidium iodide (PI) and 5 U RNase A, and the DNA
content and SubG1 DNA fragmentation was measured
using a FACStar Plus system (Becton-Dickson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) as previously described [26, 27]. Cellular
apoptosis was also assessed by APC-Annexin V antibody
(Biolegend, San Diego, CA) staining immediately after
treatment with VMY and analyzed using FACStar Plus
dual laser FACSort system (Becton-Dickson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) as previously described by us [26, 27, 49, 50].

Immunoblotting
Protein extracts were separated on 4-20% Trisglycine gels and electro-blotted onto PVDF membranes
as previously described [13, 26, 27]. Protein levels
were assessed using antibodies against p53 (Millipore,
#05-224), PARP (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA #9542),
b-actin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA #4967), p21 (Santa
Cruz #SC 756), LC3B (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA
#3868S) and P62 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA #5114S)
Densitometry was performed using ImageJ analysis
software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) as previously described
[13, 26, 27].

METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
All commercial cell lines were obtained from
the ATCC. The human cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC3,
AsPC1, PC12 and COLO-357 were maintained in
RPMI containing 10% FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate,
and 100 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin. The cell lines
DU145, MCF7, MDA-MB231, MIA-PACA and A172
were maintained in DMEM media containing 10% FBS,
L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin. T98G
cells were maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential
Media containing 10% FBS, L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml
Penicillin-Streptomycin. Human radical prostatectomy
samples were collected under the auspices and approval
of the Georgetown University and Massachusetts General
Hospital Institutional Review Boards. Following detailed

MA) in appropriate media. After an 18 hr incubation
with 30 µM VMY, the AO solution was added at a final
concentration of 10 µM, and the cells were incubated
for 20 minutes at 37ºC. Live cells were imaged on a
Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) LSM510 Meta microscope.
Non-protonated AO (green fluorescence) was imaged
using argon 488 laser and a 488 dichroic mirror and a
525/50 bandpass filter. For the protonated (orange/red
fluorescence) species of AO, a multi-photon chameleon
laser was set to 760 with a 700 short pass filter using a
651/42 emission filter. LC3 translocation was detected
using the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused LC3
construct that was generously donated by Dr Robert
Clarke [36]. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6 well plates
contained glass coverslips and allowed to attach overnight.
14 ug of LC3-GFP expression plasmid were transfected
using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) as previously described [36]. 24 hours
after transfection, the cells were pretreated or not with
5uM 3MA or 50 uM Chloroquine for 20 minutes and
further treated with VMY or vehicle. After 18 hours, the
coverslips with attached cells were stained with DAPI and
rinsed 3 times with PBS. The excess buffer was removed
and the coverslips were mounted. Imaging was performed
by confocal microscopy as previously described [27].

The p53 wild-type and p53G245A mutant vectors,
have been previously described by us [14, 51]. For
adenovirus knockdown experiments, Adp53shRNA and
empty vector control virus were purchased commercially
(Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA, #1854) and used as
described by the manufacturer. For lentivirus-based
p53 knockdown experiments, the pLKO-p53shRNA
and empty vector lentivirus vectors (kindly provided by
Todd Waldman, Georgetown University) were used as
described [39]. Briefly, 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA)
were cotransfected with shRNA constructs along with the
pHR′8.2ΔR and pCMV-VSV-G helper constructs. After
24 hours, the media was changed and the virus-containing
media was harvested after an additional 24 hours of
incubation. The prostate cancer cells were seeded at 30%
confluency and viral infections were performed for 72
hours prior to treatment with VMY or DMSO. Efficiency
of the knockdown was monitored by p53 immunoblotting
as previously described [14, 26, 51].

p53 restoration
DU145 cells were pre-treated with 75µM PRIMA-1
(Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 24hrs prior to treatment.
Activity of PRIMA-1 was monitored via assessing the
induction of p21CIP1/WAF1 (Santa Cruz, sc481) protein levels
by immunoblot.

Autophagy and Apoptosis Inhibitors.
For the autophagy inhibition, 3-methyladenine (3MA) (Sigma, St Louis, MO M921) was used at 5mM
and 10 mM concentrations and chloroquine diphosphate
(Sigma, St Louis, MO) was used at 50 µM and 100 µM.
Cells were exposed to these inhibitors for 20 minutes prior
to treatment with either DMSO or VMY.
The caspase 8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, (Sigma, St
Louis, MO) and the caspase 9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK
(Sigma, St Louis, MO) were resuspended in DMSO and
used at final concentrations of 20uM.
