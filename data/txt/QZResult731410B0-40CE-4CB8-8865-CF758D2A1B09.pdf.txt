ABSTRACT
Most age-related diseases and aging itself are associated with chronic
inflammation. Thus pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory processes may
be effective antiaging strategy. In this study we demonstrated that treatment of
Drosophila melanogaster with 10 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs:
CAY10404, aspirin, APHS, SC-560, NS-398, SC-58125, valeroyl salicylate, transresveratrol, valdecoxib, licofelone) leads to extension of lifespan, delays agedependent decline of locomotor activity and increases stress resistance. The effect
of the lifespan increase was associated with decrease of fecundity. Depending on
the concentration, NSAIDs demonstrated both anti- and pro-oxidant properties in
Drosophila tissues. However, we failed to identify clear correlation between antioxidant
properties of NSAIDs and their pro-longevity effects. The lifespan extending effects of
APHS, SC-58125, valeroyl salicylate, trans-resveratrol, valdecoxib, and licofelone were
more pronounced in males, valdecoxib and aspirin - in females. We demonstrated
that lifespan extension effect of NSAIDs was abolished in flies with defective genes
involved in Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2 pathway.

INTRODUCTION

lifespan in various model organisms including yeast [10],
nematodes [11], flies [10], and mice [12, 13]. NSAIDs
are also effective in treatment of the neurodegenerative
disorders like Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s
disease [8, 14-16]. NSAIDs demonstrate anticancer
effects, tumor suppression and apoptosis stimulation
[7, 17, 18]. Most NSAIDs are traditionally considered
to be inhibitors of cyclooxygenases (COX), which
induce inflammation activity via catalysis of prostanoid
biosynthesis [19].
However, according to growing number of recent
publications, NSAIDs have multiple molecular targets,
and the range of their activity may be broader than COX
inhibition [17, 20].
Many studies have experimentally demonstrated
that NSAIDs have antioxidant activity via anti-radical

Chronic inflammation is one of the main processes
that causes disruption of normal functioning of tissues and
contributes to age-associated diseases and aging [1, 2].
There is a popular industry term «inflammaging», which
is used to describe aging associated with the development
of chronic inflammation [3]. Inflammation is accompanied
by increase of the activity of pro-inflammatory pathways
with age [4, 5]. Inflammatory cause of different age
diseases: metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease and
Huntington’s disease [6-8]. Pharmacological and genetic
inhibition of inflammatory processes is considered as
effective and proven anti-aging strategy [9].

activity and membrane-stabilizing action. Anti-radical
activity of NSAIDs is mediated by free radical scavenging
and antioxidant enzyme activation [21]. NSAIDs exhibit
antioxidant activity on model membranes [22], in cells
[23, 24], as well as on the organismal level [25, 26].
Anti-inflammatory effects of rapamycin and
resveratrol may be associated with pharmacological
stimulation of autophagic activity via mTOR inhibition
and AMPK activation, respectively. Autophagy prevents
the activation of inflammasomes and induction of
inflammatory responses [27, 28].
In Caenorhabditis elegans NSAID celecoxib was
shown to acts directly on 3’-phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase-1 (PDK-1), a component of the insulin/IGF1 signaling cascade to increase lifespan [11]. In yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae the functional homolog of
PDK-1 is Pkh1 which is involved in Pkh2-ypk1-lem3tat2 signaling pathway. Recent studies demonstrated that
another NSAID ibuprofen increases lifespan in yeast,
nematodes and fruit flies [10]. This effect is dependent on
the ability of ibuprofen to inhibit the tryptophan permease
Tat2p which is the component of Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2
signaling pathway also [10, 29]. Functional homologs of
Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2 signaling pathway are also known
in Drosophila, including Pkh2/Pdk1 [30], ypk1/S6k [31],
lem3/CG8679 [32], and tat2/CG14741 [33], that allows
to study the mechanisms of NSAID effects on Drosophila
model.
The purpose of this study is to explore the
geroprotective properties of NSAIDs, their impact on
lifespan, life quality (locomotor activity), fecundity, and
stress resistance in Drosophila model, reveal toxicity, the
antioxidant activity and membrane-protective activity
of these compounds using in vitro and in vivo models.
In addition it is planned to clarify the role of Pkh2ypk1-lem3-tat2 signaling pathway in the formation of
geroprotective effects.

μM, aspirin, APHS, NS-398, SC-58125 extended median
lifespan by 6.8-16.9%, and NS-398 increase the age of
90% mortality by 3.9% (Figure 1A, 1B).
When exposed to NSAIDs in females at
concentration of 0.05 μM we observed increases in median
lifespan by 5.9-12%. Also SC-560, trans-resveratrol
and valdecoxib at this concentration increased the age
of 90% mortality by 3.4-6.9%. Aspirin and NS-398 at
concentration 0.5 μM extended median lifespan by 7.7
and 9.3% respectively, and the age of 90% mortality by
1.6 and 6.3% respectively. APHS at concentration 0.5 μM
increase median lifespan by 9.6%. The most significant
effects on the longevity of females we observed when
exposed to NSAIDs at concentration of 1 μM. Aspirin at
this concentration extended median lifespan by 32.7%.
Trans-resveratrol, CAY10404, APHS, NS-398, valdecoxib
and licofelone at concentration of 1 μM increased median
lifespan by 9.6-15.4%. All test substances except valeryl
salicylate increased the age of 90% mortality by 4.113.7% (Figure 1C, 1D).
Some of the substances we tested reduced lifespan
of flies. SC-560 at a concentration of 0.5 μM significantly
reduced the median lifespan of males by 6% and decreased
the age of 90% mortality in males by 8.3%, and in females
by 3.2% Valeryl salicylate at a concentration of 1 μM
reduced the age of 90% mortality of females by 4.1%.
CAY10404 at a concentration of 0.5 μM reduced the age
of 90% mortality of female by 4.8% (Figure 1A, 1B, 1C,
1D).

Effects of NSAIDs on fly feeding
According to the feeding assay flies ate less paste
containing SC-560 (37.3% lower level of fluorescence),
NS-398 (43.1% lower), SC-58125 (44% lower). On the
contrary, we observed a higher level of fluorescence in
the flies, when aspirin (58.6%) was added into the paste.
In other experiment variants we observed no change in
the amount of food consumed. Regression analysis did
not reveal statistically significant correlation between the
amount of food consumed and the changes in lifespan
(Supplemental Figure 1).

RESULTS
Effects of NSAIDs on longevity

Effects NSAIDs on locomotor activity and fertility

While exposing the flies to test substances, we
observed a significant increase in median survival age and
90% mortality in males and females (Figure 1).
All substances in a concentration of 0.05 μM
significant increased the median lifespan of the male
by 8.3-19.6% and the age of 90% mortality by 5.120.3%. Geroprotective activity of the test NSAIDs in
males decreased at concentration 0.5 and 1 μM. At the
concentration 0.5 μM, aspirin, CAY10404, APHS, NS398, SC-58125 and licofelone extended median lifespan
by 4-8%. Also, aspirin increased the age of 90% mortality
by 6.7%. When exposed to the highest concentration of 1

last measuring point on the 45th day. Females showed
no significant changes in the negative geotaxis test when
exposed to NSAIDs.
We often observed a decrease in spontaneous
activity of males and females in the first half of life in 5-25
days. However, in 35 and 45 days, spontaneous activity,
in most embodiments a exposure was equal to control or
higher than control values. Likofelon had the strongest

function with age (Figure 2).
Test substances have different effects on female
fertility. We observed an increase in fertility in the middle
of the measurement time when exposed to almost all
substances. However, we did not find the extension of
the reproductive period females. It may be noted that
NSAIDs at concentration of 0.05 μM and especially the
0.5 μM were more positive effects on female fertility.
In contrast, NSAIDs at concentration of 1 μM had more

negative effects on fertility. Some substances with most
geroprotective properties often had a fairly strong negative
effect on fertility. It was aspirin, APHS and NS-398
(Figure 3).

Effects of NSAIDs on stress resistance and level of
lipid peroxidation products
Preliminary experiments have shown that all tested
compounds at a concentration of 0.5 µМ were not toxic to

compounds relative to spontaneous hemolysis was 1.17.
The results of the comparative evaluation of
the membrane-protective activity are shown in Figure
4A. Nine of the ten compounds studied were able to

protect cells from death under stress of acute oxidative
stress. Resveratrol proved to be the most active one in
this respect. Only licofelone, a complex inhibitor of
cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase did not possess
the membrane-protective activity; however, it statistically

and antioxidant activity have been closely correlated (Rs

Biologically active compounds can have an impact
on organism’s lifespan, indirectly, through a complex

of different mechanisms. Since a vast majority of the
compounds investigated are not only COX inhibitors, they
also have a powerful antioxidant activity, it is possible that
this property could also affect the results obtained when
evaluating the parameters of lifespan of model animals.
In order to analyze the contribution of the antioxidant

and membrane-protectiveactivity of NSAIDs on lifetime
variation in Drosophila maintained on a medium
supplemented with test compounds at 0.05, 0.5 and 1 µМ
concentrations, an appropriate regression analysis was
performed. However, none of the cases were statistically
significant for an association between the antioxidant/
membrane-protective activity of the compounds and
the parameters characterizing the Drosophila lifespan
(median lifespan and age of 90% mortality). Thus, among
all compounds studied resveratrol possessed the most
significant antioxidant and membrane-protective activity;
however, supplementing the nutrient medium with this
compound did not lead to a dramatic increase in the
lifespan of model animals.
An analysis of the secondary products of
lipid peroxidation in Drosophila homogenates has
demonstrated that at both concentrations (0.05 and 1μM)
the test compounds have a more considerable effect on
males. At the same time males are characterized by
a higher level of lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the
effect of the compounds significantly depended on both
the concentration and the sex of animals. Previously,
we observed a similar phenomenon in relation to other
biologically active substances (BAS) in experiments

conducted on laboratory mice [34].
For example, maintenance of flies on the nutrient
medium supplemented with NSAIDsat a concentration of
1 µM in most cases resulted in a statistically significant
decrease in the LPO level in male organisms, while in
females half of the compounds caused an increase in the
secondary products of lipid peroxidation (Figure 4C, 4D).
A use of lower concentrations of NSAIDs in the
nutrient medium (0.05 µM) caused an increase in the
intensity of lipid peroxidation in male tissues and did not
significantly affect females (Figure 4C, 4D). Regression
analysis showed no association between the intensity of
lipid peroxidation in Drosophila tissues and the parameters
characterizing their lifespan.
Thus, despite the fact that the vast majority of
the NSAIDs examined in this study have prominent
antioxidant properties, other mechanisms of their
pharmacological activity are implemented as well.
This underlies an ambiguous effect on such an integral
indicator, as lifespan.

SC-560 and trans-resveratrol at concentrations of 1 µM,
we observed a decrease in survival ratio under oxidative
stress, where as upon exposure to SC-560, SC-58125,
trans-resveratrol, licofeloneat a concentration of 1 µM we
observed such a decrease during starvation (Figure 5).
Studies of the resistance of females to exogenous
stresses demonstrated that NSAIDs at concentrations
of 1 and 0.05 µM significantly increased survival
ratios upon exposure to paraquat, under heat shock and
during starvation. Aspirin at a concentration of 0.05 µM
reduced the survival ratio of females under heat shock,
at a concentration of 1 µM it reduced the survival ratio
in starvation, and at the concentrations of 1 µM and 0.05
µM it reduced the survival ratio under oxidative stress.
APHS significantly reduces the survival ratio of females
under heat shock at a concentration of 0.05 µM, while SC560 and NS-398 significantly reduce it at a concentration
of 1 µM. Valeryl salicylate reduces the survival ratio of
females under oxidative stress at a concentration of 0.05
µM, whereas CAY10404, trans-resveratrol and licofelone
reduce it at a concentration of 1 µM. Trans-resveratrol and
licofelone at a concentration of 1 µM significantly reduce
the resistance of females to starvation (Figure 5).

with 1 μM of valeroyl salicylate decreased lifespan. The
most effective NSAIDs which increased lifespan by more
than 15% were APHS (by 17%), SC-58125 (by 17%),
valeroyl salicylate (by 17%), trans-resveratrol (by 20%),
valdecoxib (by 20%),and licofelone (by 20%) in males,
valdecoxib (by15%) and aspirin (by 33%) in females. The
most active concentrations were 0.05μM in males and 1
μM in females.
Our data are consistent with the lifespan extending
effects of NSAIDs previously obtained in yeast [10, 35],
nematodes [10, 11, 36], flies [10], honey bee [37], and
in mice [12]. The inhibition of other pro-inflammatory
factors such as NF-κB [38] and iNOS [39] increases
Drosophila lifespan also.
According to the feeding assay analysis flies
consumed less food containing some substances (SC560, NS-398, SC-58125). However, we did not observe
any correlation between lifespan and the level of food
consumption (Supplemental Figure 1).
In addition, NSAIDs delayed age-dependent decline
in locomotor activity. This effect may be associated
with neuroprotective action of NSAIDs [14, 15]. As it
was shown previously, aspirin reduces age-associated
functional declines in C. elegans also [36].
We observed a decrease in female fecundity. It may
be related to the fact that NSAIDs inhibits the activity
of Pxt, a COX-like facilitator of follicle maturationin
Drosophila [40]. Therefore, the effect of the lifespan
increase may be associated with decrease offecundity.
Attention is drawn to the similarity of life-extending
effects of various anti-inflammatory drugs (Figure 1). This
suggests that non-specific component (hormesis) may also
be implicated in triggering these effects [41]. Hormesis is
usually associated with the activation of various cellular
stress-resistance mechanisms, such as heat shock proteins,
antioxidant enzymes, DNA repair mechanisms, immune
response, selection of unfit cells and may increase both
longevity and stress resistance [42-49].
Therefore, we tested whether NSAIDs might also
increase Drosophila resistance to oxidative stress, heat
shock and starvation. We found that NSAIDs increased
resistance to various stresses. Increased resistance to
heat shock and starvation may be related to the ability of
NSAIDs to inhibit the components of the insulin/IGF-1
signaling [11, 50, 51].
Depending on the concentration and the
experimental model NSAIDs demonstrate both anti- and
pro-oxidant properties. The antioxidant properties were
revealed in the erythrocytes model and Drosophila tissues
at a concentrations of 0.5 μM and 1 μM, accordingly.
However, at a concentration of 0.05 μM we observed prooxidant properties of NSAIDs in Drosophila males. Thus
we failed to find correlation between antioxidant properties
of NSAIDs and their antiaging action in Drosophila.
Thus, our data support the new paradigm that ROS
is not involved in aging under physiological, nonstressed

The role of Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2 pathway
In order to understand the mechanisms of
geroprotective properties of NSAIDs we studied the
effects of aspirin, valdecoxib, and NS-398 on the lifespan
of Drosophila defective in Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2 signaling
pathway.
We observed a decrease in lifespan in flies with
activated RNA interference of genes ypk1/S6k, Pkh2/Pdk1
and lem3/CG8679 upon exposure to aspirin, valdecoxib,
NS-398 at a concentration of 1 μM (Figures 6, 7, 8).
However, inActGS>ypk1/S6kRNAi#2 males exposure
to NS-398 induced a slight extension in lifespan. In
ActGS>lem3/CG8679RNAi females we observed an
increase in the survival ratio in the second half of life. The
treatment with NSAIDs of tat-2/CG14741 knockout males
were characterized by a decreased lifespan, while females,
had an extended lifespan.

DISCUSSION
Thus we investigated the effects of 10 NSAIDs
at concentrations of 0.05, 0.5 and 1 μM on Drosophila
lifespan, life quality (locomotor activity), fecundity,
and stress resistance (oxidative stress, heat shock and
starvation).
We demonstrated that all studied NSAIDs induced
increase in median lifespan (by 4-19% in males and by
2-33% in females), and an age of 90% mortality rate (by
2-20 % in males and by 2-13 % in females). However,

conditions [52]. Numerous experiments on animals also
showed that manipulation of antioxidant gene expression
often has little effect on life span, and that levels of
mitochondrial ROS do not limit it and moreover an
increased ROS production correlated with extended life
span [53, 54]. Clinical trials demonstrated that current
antioxidants do not prolong life and reduction of ROS by
antioxidants can even shorten life span [54]. Perhaps this
is due to ROS important physiological roles, including
regulatory role in cellular signaling pathways, and
elimination of ROS may not be favorable for the organism.
Previous studies demonstrated that antioxidant
and neuroprotective effects of NSAIDs are associated
with inhibition of COX and reduction in the production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the metabolism
of arachidonic acid, a decrease of the prostaglandin
synthesis and a decline of β-amyloid accumulation [8,
14, 15]. Licofelone, due to its conformational similarity
with arachidonic acid, is capable of binding to the active
sites of both classes of enzymes COX-1 and COX-2,
blocking their catalytic activity [55], and normalizing the
parameters of lipid peroxidation in brain tissues with an
experimental Huntington’s syndrome [26].
At the same time, NSAIDs are known to have
intrinsic antioxidant activity [22, 24, 56]. For example,
a complex biological activity of resveratrol is associated
not only with its ability to interact with multiple
molecular targets, in particular, cyclooxygenase, but
also with a high antioxidant activity due to both a direct
elimination of ROS and inhibition of enzymes involved
in their formation, as well as enhancement of activity
of antioxidant protection enzymes [57]. It has been
experimentally demonstrated that resveratrol possesses
a high antioxidant activity on model membranes [22], in
cells [24, 58, 59], as well as in model organisms [25, 60].
Furthermore, many of the effects of resveratrol are due
to an action of its metabolites, and even very low doses
of resveratrol can affect an organism through an indirect
action [57].
Thus, the antioxidant effect of NSAIDs may be
less pronounced on the level of lipid peroxidation due
to the absence of COX in Drosophila. However intrinsic
antioxidant activity of NSAIDs may protect Drosophila
from acute toxicity of paraquat.
In accordance with the findings available from
literature, ibuprofen and celecoxib have targets in yeast
(Tat2p) [10], nematodes (Pkh2/PDK-1) [11], involved
in Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2 signaling pathway [30]. We
therefore studied the role of Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2
signaling pathway in the effects of NSAIDs on lifespan in
Drosophila model.
In our study, RNA interference of gene Pkh2/Pdk1
led to an increase in longevity of Drosophila females.
Our data is consistent with the effects of pharmacological
inhibition of Pkh2/PDK-1 in nematode [11]. Simultaneous
RNAi of Pkh2/Pdk 1and exposure to NSAIDs reduced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the positive effect of RNA interference on female
longevity. It should be noted that the effects of NSAIDs
on flies with other components of Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2
signaling pathway being affected also led to a decrease in
longevity. Thus the lifespan extending effects of NSAIDs
in Drosophila model is mediated by Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2
signaling pathway.
Thus, we demonstrated the ability of 10 NSAIDs
(CAY10404, aspirin, APHS, SC-560, NS-398, SC58125, valeroyl salicylate, trans-resveratrol, valdecoxib,
licofelone) to extend lifespan and increase resistance to
stress in Drosophila accompanied by positive effects
on locomotor activity. The lifespan extending effects of
APHS, SC-58125, valeroyl salicylate, trans-resveratrol,
valdecoxib, and licofelone was more pronounced in
males, valdecoxib and aspirin- in females. The effect
of the lifespan increase was associated with decrease
of fecundity. No correlation was found between the
antioxidant properties of NSAIDs and lifespan-extending
effect. At the same time, increasing of the survival rate of
NSAIDs-treated flies under the influence of paraquat can
be associated with the antioxidant activity of substances.
The lifespan extension effect of NSAIDs was abolished in
flies that are defective in genes of Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2
pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drosophila melanogaster strains
Strains obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila
Stock Center were used in this study.
Standard laboratory wild-type strain Canton-S
(stock #1) was used to test geroprotective properties of
NSAIDs.
To investigate the role of Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2
signaling pathway in NSAIDs effects we used knockout
line tat-2/CG14741(stock #18847, genotype: w1118;
PBac{WH}ATP8Bf05203), as well as transgenic RNAi
strains: Pkh2/Pdk1RNAi (stock #27725, genotype: y1
v1; P{TRiP.JF02807}attP2), ypk1/S6kRNAi#1 (stocks
#41702, genotype: y1 v1; P{TRiP.HMS02267}attP2), ypk1/
S6kRNAi#2 (stocks #41895, genotype: y1 sc* v1; P{TRiP.
GL01327}attP2), lem3/CG8679RNAi (stock #38348,
genotype: y1 v1; P{TRiP.HMS01816}attP40). To induce
RNAi we used driver line ActGS containing the RU486inducible GAL4 in all cells (stock #9431, genotype:
P{hsFLP}12, y1 w*; P{UAS-GFP.S65T}Myo31DFT2;
P{Act5C(-FRT)GAL4.Switch.PR}3/TM6B, Tb1).

Treatment with substances
We greased fly medium by paste of hydrolyzed
yeast containing one of the substances. Control untreated
19439

Oncotarget

animals were fed by yeast past without substances. To
make the hydrolyz at yeast were boiled in water bath for
30 minutes. To prepare the 100 ml of paste 50 g of dry
yeast per 60 mL of water were used.
Flies were treated throughout their whole
lives with the substances as follows: aspirin
(2-(acetyloxy)-benzoic
acid),
valeryl
salicylate
(2[(1-oxopentyl)oxy]-benzoicacid),
transresveratrol
((E)-5[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl]1,3-benzenediol), SC-560 (5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4methoxyphenyl)-3-(3fluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole),
APHS (2-(2-heptynylthio)-phenol-acetate), NS-398 (N[2-(cyclohexyloxy)-4-nitrophenyl]-methanesolfonamide),
SC-58125 (5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1- [4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pirazole),
valdecoxib
(4-(5-methyl-3-phenyl-4-isoxazolyl)-benzenesulfonamide),
CAY10404
(3-(4-methylsulphonylphenyl)-4phenyl-5-trifluoromethylisoxazole),
licofelone
(6-(4-chlorophenyl)-2, 3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-phenyl1H-pyrrolizine-5-acetic acid) at the concentrations of 0.05,
0.5, 1 μM (Cayman Chemical, USA).

cycle and at densities of 30 same sex and age flies per
vial containing sugar-yeast medium covered with a yeast
paste. Flies were transferred to fresh medium 2 times per
week. The number of dead flies was counted daily. The
longevity of males and females was analyzed separately.
Analysis was carried out in three replications, with 80-120
flies in each.

Locomotor activity analysis
In order to measure locomotor activity a hardware
and software complex «Drosophila population monitor»
(TriKinetics Inc., USA) was used. Spontaneous locomotor
activity was measured (for 3 min), and a negative geotaxis
test was performed. The flies were shaken off to the bottom
of a tube, and movement was measured for 20 sec in three
replications. When evaluating the spontaneous activity,
an integral activity of flies for 3 min was registered. For
the negative geotaxis test, an arithmetical mean for three
replications was calculated to offset an impact of random
factors. The measurements in each variant were carried
out, as long as there was the sufficient number of living
flies to perform the analysis, which was 30 pieces.

Feeding assay

Female fecundity analysis

To evaluate the effects of NSAIDs on the food intake
we used the ﬂuorescein dye (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as the
food tracer. To perform the test, three-to-four day-old
females were placed on the paste (with or without NSAIDs
in concentration 1 μM) containing 50 μM ﬂuorescein.
After 1 h of feeding, the ﬂies were anesthetised and
placed in liquid nitrogen for 20 sec. The frozen ﬂies were
then brieﬂy vortexed in tube to separate ﬂy heads from
the bodies. The ﬂy bodies (5 ﬂies per 1 mL) were then
homogenized in distilled water, and the homogenates were
centrifuged 2 min at 15,000g. Then 0.8 mL of supernatant
was transferred to a new tube, the volume was adjusted
to 1.5 mL, and centrifugation was repeated. Before the
measurements, the supernatant was diluted with distilled
water 1:1. The ﬂuorescence level in resulting solution was
then measured on spectroﬂuorimeter Fluorat-02-Panorama
(Lumex, Russia) with a ﬂuorescence excitation of 480 nm
and an emission registration of 521 nm. Nine independent
replicates were performed for each experiment. The level
of food intake was estimated on the base of average
values of ﬂuorescence intensity. Regression analysis was
performed to assess the correlation between the amount of
food consumed and the lifespan. To assess the statistical
significance of differences fluorescence level was carried
out using the t-test.

Fecundity was evaluated by the mean number of
eggs and pupae per female. For this purpose, the groups
consisting of 10 males and 10 females with the same
age were placed into vials with fresh medium. After one
day, the flies were transferred to a new medium, and the
number of eggs laid was counted. After 10 days pupae
formed were counted. A mean fecundity was calculated
as a ratio between the number of eggs or pupae and the
number of females in a group.

Stress resistance analysis
To study an effect of heat shock, the flies were
placed into an incubator at 35° C.
To study an effect of the oxidative stress, a solution
of 20 mM of the pro-oxidant paraquat dissolved in 5%
sucrose was used. This oxidative stress medium was
applied to a filter paper and placed into vials instead of the
nutrient medium.
To study the effect of starvation on the flies they
were placed into vials with 2% agar.

Lifespan analysis

Toxicity, antioxidant activity and membraneprotective activity study

To analyze the lifespan, the imagoes of the same age
of both sexes were selected. Control and experimental flies
were maintained at 25±0.5°C under a 12h light/12h dark

To study the toxicity, antioxidant activity and
membrane-protective activity (in vitro) of the compounds,
an erythrocyte suspension of laboratory mice blood in

phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) was used. The
toxicity of the compounds was evaluated by their ability
to induce the death of erythrocytes (hemolysis). The
solution of compounds dissolved in ethanol were added to
the erythrocyte suspension at a final concentration of 0.5
μM and incubated at 37° C for 5 h in a thermostatically
controlled shaker Biosan ES-20 (Latvia), control samples
also contained ethanol. The membrane-protective and
antioxidant activities were determined by a degree
of inhibition of induced hemolysis and inhibition of
accumulation of secondary products of lipid peroxidation
in erythrocytes, respectively. For this purpose, after
adding of the solutions of the different compounds (final
concentration of 0.5 μM) to the erythrocyte suspension
the hemolysis was induced by the addition of H2O2
solution (1.8 mM). Then this reaction mixture was
shaken gently while being incubated for 5 h, at 37°C.
Every hour an aliquot of the incubation medium was
taken and centrifuged for 5 min. The hemolysis degree
was determined based on the hemoglobin content in
the supernatant using a spectrophotometer Genesys 20
(Thermo Scientific, USA) at λ 524 nm, the percentage of
hemolysis was calculated in relation to the total hemolysis
of a sample [61-63]. Each experiment was performed in
five parallels and two replications.

The Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted using a program
Statistica, version 6.1 (StatSoft, Inc., USA), the calculation
of the lifespan parameters and their statistical analysis
were performed in a statistical programming environment
R [72].
To assess the statistical significance of differences in
resistance to stress-factors, the Fisher’s exact test was used
[73, 74]. Statistical analyses of the data were performed
using OASIS: Online Application for the Survival
Analysis of Lifespan Assays [74].
Statistical significance of differences in the
fecundity and locomotor activity was evaluated using the
χ2 criterion [75].
To process the locomotor activity and fecundity data
Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft, USA) was used.
Statistical significance of differences in toxicity,
antioxidant and membrane-protecting activity of
NSAIDs (in vitro erythrocytes model) and content of
LPO secondary products in flies was assessed by a nonparametric Mann-Whitney test [76]. Significance was
set at p < 0.05. Regression analyses were also performed
to compare the changes of various parameters tested
for using model objects. Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient (Rs) was calculated. Analyses were performed
by applying software packages Microsoft Office Excel
2007 and Statistica 6.0.

Analysis of the level of secondary products of lipid
peroxidation (LPO)

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

University for preparing and editing the manuscript.

The content of the secondary products of lipid
peroxidation from a reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid
(TBA-RS) was determined using the spectrophotometer at
λ = 532 nm [64] in a modification [65, 66]. To prevent the
oxidation of lipids in the process of analysis a butylated
hydroxyltoluene (BHT) solution in ethanol (0.01%) was
added to the samples. Samples without addition of the
TBA solution were used as an external control in order to
avoid artifacts of measuring LPO due to the Drosophila
eye color. A concentration of TBA-RS products was
calculated taking into account the extinction coefficient
(1.56 × 105 M-1 cm-1) and expressed in nmol/mg protein or
nmol/mg of fly mass.
