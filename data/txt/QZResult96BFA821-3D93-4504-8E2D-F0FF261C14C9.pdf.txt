Abstract
Members of the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein family are involved
in repair of genetic damage caused by DNA cross-linkers. It is
not clear whether the FA proteins function in oxidative DNA
damage and oncogenic stress response. Here, we report that
deficiency in the Fanca gene in mice elicits a p53-dependent
growth arrest and DNA damage response to oxidative DNA
damage and oncogenic stress. Using a Fanca / Trp53 /
double knockout model and a functionally switchable p53
retrovirus, we define the kinetics, dependence, and persistence
of p53-mediated response to oxidative and oncogenic stresses in
Fanca / cells. Notably, oxidative stress induces persistent p53
response in Fanca / cells, likely due to accumulation of
unrepaired DNA damage. On the other hand, whereas wild-type
cells exhibit prolonged response to oncogene activation, the
p53-activating signals induced by oncogenic ras are short-lived
in Fanca / cells, suggesting that Fanca may be required for
the cell to engage p53 during constitutive ras activation. We
propose that the FA proteins protect cells from stress-induced
proliferative arrest and tumor evolution by acting as a
modulator of the signaling pathways that link FA to p53. [Cancer

Introduction
Research on Fanconi anemia (FA) has recently generated great
interest because the disease serves as an excellent model for
hematopoietic failure and leukemic evolution. FA is a genetic
disorder associated with bone marrow (BM) failure and cancers,
particularly leukemia (1–3). FA is genetically heterogeneous,
with 13 complementation groups identified thus far. The genes
encoding the groups A (FANCA), B (FANCB), C (FANCC), D1
(FANCD1/BRCA2), D2 (FANCD2), E (FANCE), F (FANCF), G (FANCG),
-I (FANCI/KIAA1794), J (FANCJ/BRIP1), L (FANCL), M (FANCM),
and N (FANCN/PALB2) have been cloned (4–18). The biological
function of FA proteins has been the subject of intense investigation
in recent years.
Because cells deficient for FA genes are hypersensitive to DNA
cross-linking agents, such as mitomycin C and diepoxybutane, it
has been proposed that the FA proteins may be involved in the
sensing and/or repair of DNA interstrand cross-links. This model is
supported by evidence that shows that an intact FA nuclear
complex is required for biochemical modification in the form of
monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI as mutations in any
one of the FA proteins that disrupt the complex prevent the

activation of FANCD2 and FANCI, leading to cross-linker
hypersensitivity and the characteristic broken and radial chromosome formation in FA cells (3, 18). The common damage to DNA
in vivo is oxidative stress, and ample evidence has suggested that
FA cells are in an in vivo prooxidant state (19) and that the FA
proteins may play important roles in cellular responses to oxidative
stress. For example, the FANCC protein has been found to interact
with NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase and glutathione
S-transferase P1-1 (20, 21), two enzymes involved in either
triggering or detoxifying reactive intermediates, including reactive
oxygen species. In addition, mice with combined deficiencies of the
antioxidative enzyme, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and the Fancc
genes showed a defective hematopoiesis (22). Another FA protein,
FANCG, interacts with cytochrome P450 2E1 (23) and mitochondrial peroxiredoxin-3 (24), suggesting a possible role of FANCG in
protection against oxidative DNA damage. Recently, Saadatzadeh
and colleagues (25) showed that oxidant hypersensitivity of
Fancc / cells was due to an altered redox regulation and
hyperactivation of the serine-threonine kinase apoptosis signalregulating kinase 1, an important kinase involved in oxidantinduced apoptosis. Moreover, oxidative stress induces complex
formation by two major FA proteins, FANCA and FANCG (26). These
observations corroborate a critical role for oxidative stress in FA
phenotype and disease progression.
Cells from patients with FA gene mutations have high
predisposition to leukemia and other cancers. However, little is
known about whether these mutant cells have high susceptibility to
oncogenic transformation. In response to oncogenic activation,
normal cells induce genetically encoded programs that prevent
deregulated proliferation and, thus, protect multicellular organisms
from cancer progression. Two such programs induced by
oncogenic activation are apoptosis and senescence, which are
normally triggered by DNA damage or other stresses. Studies have
shown that overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2,
or deletion of apoptosis-associated and senescence-associated
proteins, such as p53, accelerates oncogene-induced tumorigenesis
(27, 28). The theory that has risen from these findings is that
oncogene-driven proliferation must be associated with inhibition of
apoptosis and senescence to allow malignant outgrowth.
The tumor suppressor p53 is a key transcription factor that
activates vital damage containment procedures to restrict aberrant
cell growth in response to DNA damage, oncogene activation, and
loss of normal cell contacts (29, 30). p53 restricts cellular growth by
inducing senescence, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis (31). Thus, p53
plays a major role in the prevention of cancer. Consistent with this,
emerging evidence suggests that p53 deficiency may increase
cancer development in patients with FA and FA mice. For example,
studies have indicated a higher proportion of human papillomavirus-positive squamous cell carcinomas in patients with FA than
in healthy controls, indicating that loss of functional p53 facilitates
tumor development (32, 33). Mice deficient for Fancd1 or Fancd2

have been shown to have accelerated tumor development in Trp53deficient background (34, 35). In addition, Fancc deficiency
accelerates the development of certain blood and solid tumors in
mice heterozygous at Trp53 (36). Moreover, these studies found
that the FA proteins and p53 cooperate in apoptosis and cell cycle
checkpoint control after DNA damage (35, 37, 38). In this study, we
show that p53 is engaged differentially in response to oxidative and
oncogenic stresses in FA cells in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Wild-type (WT), Fanca / mice and double knockout mice
(p53 / ; Fanca / ) were generated by interbreeding the heterozygous
Fanca+/ and p53+/ mice. The genetic background of the mice was
C57BL/6 mice, which were used at f6 to 10 wk of age. All experimental
procedures conducted in this study were approved by the institutional animal
care and use committee of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.
Isolation of BM lineage-depleted cells and differentiation assay. The
femora and tibiae were harvested from the mice immediately after their
sacrifice with CO2. BM cells were flushed from bones into Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS, using a
21-guage needle and syringe. Low-density BM mononuclear cells (BMMNC)
were separated by Ficoll Hypaque density gradient (Sigma) and washed with
IMDM. BMMNC were depleted of lineage-committed cells using a lineage
cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instruction. For myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, BM
Lin cells were cultured with various cytokine combinations known to
support myeloid [100 ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF), 10 ng/mL granulocytemonocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)] or lymphoid [100 ng/mL
SCF, 10 ng/mL each of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and IL-7] differentiation. After
5 d, cells were stained with antibodies against myeloid markers Gr-1 and
Mac-1 or lymphoid markers B220 and CD3e, followed by flow cytometric
analysis using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).
Mouse embryonic fibroblast isolation and culture. Mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEF) were prepared from day 13.5 embryo derived from crosses
of p53+/ with Fanca+/ mice. The head and the red organs were removed,
and the torso was minced and dispersed with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA by using
20-gauge needle. Single-cell suspension obtained was cultured in DMEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, MEM nonessential amino
acid, penicillin/streptomycin, and gentamicin under 5% CO2 for 3 d until
the genotypes were confirmed. Cells were then trypsinized and expanded
for experimental use. MEFs were further maintained on the basis of 3T3
protocol.
Construction of retroviral expression vectors. The full-length human
FANCA cDNA was subcloned into the NotI site of retroviral vector MIEG3 to
create MIEG3-FANCA. The WT mouse p53 (mp53wt), a temperaturesensitive mutant p53 (tsp53V143A), and H-ras V12 cloned in MIEG3 were
kindly provided by Dr. Yi Zheng (Cincinnati Children’s Medical Center). The
plasmids (10 Ag each) were used to produce retroviral supernatant.
Retroviral-mediated gene transfer. Helper virus–free Phoenix packaging cells (kindly provided by Dr. Gary Nolan, Stanford University) were
plated at the density of 3  106 in 10-cm tissue culture dish and incubated
for 24 h. Cells were then transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation
with 10 Ag of retroviral plasmids (15 h at 37jC). Retroviral supernatant was
collected at different time points (24, 36, and 48 h), respectively. After
transfection, the virus-containing medium was filtered (0.45 Am filter,
Millipore) and aliquoted at 80jC. WT, Fanca / , p53 / ;Fanca +/+, and
p53 / ;Fanca / MEFs were plated at the density of 8  105 cells per 10-cm
dish and incubated overnight at 37jC. For infections, culture medium was
replaced by appropriate retroviral supernatant in the presence of 4 Ag/mL
polybrene (Sigma) for 12 h. Infection process was repeated twice. At
24 h after infection, EGFP-positive cells were used for different assays, as
indicated in Results.
Colony and cell proliferation assay. Low-density BMMNCs were plated
in a 35-mm tissue culture dish in 4 mL of semisolid medium containing
3 mL of MethoCult M 3134 (Stem Cell Technologies) and the following

growth factors: 100 ng/mL SCF, 10 ng/mL IL-3, 100 ng/mL GM-CSF, and
4 units/mL erythropoietin (Peprotech). On day 10 after plating, erythroid
and myeloid colonies were enumerated. Hematopoietic clonal growth
results were expressed as means (of triplicate plates) F SD of three
experiments. For proliferation, cells were cultured for 24 h in normal growth
medium supplemented with 10 Amol/L BrdUrd (Sigma), harvested, and
fixed in 70% ethanol. BrdUrd-labeled cells fixed in 70% ethanol were treated
with 2 N HCl (20 min at room temperature), followed by addition of two
volumes of 0.1 mol/L sodium borate (pH 8.5). The cells were incubated with
an anti-BrdUrd mouse monoclonal antibody, washed, and incubated with
FITC-conjugated antimouse antibody. Cells were counterstained overnight
with 5 Ag/mL of propidium iodide containing 40 Ag/mL of RNase. The
stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Apoptosis assay and cell cycle analysis. Cells were stained with
Annexin V and 7AAD using BD ApoAlert Annexin V kit (BD Pharmingen) in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction. Apoptosis was analyzed by
quantification of Annexin V–positive cell population by flow cytometry. For
cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed with 0.25% formaldehyde in PBS and
permeabilized with 0.3% Nonidet P-40. Cells were then stained with
propidium iodide containing 1 mg/mL RNase A, followed by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for G0-G1, S, and G2-M populations
using a FACS caliber.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells were plated on 18-mm diameter glass
coverslips and allowed to recover for 24 h before treatment with H2O2.
Treated cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room
temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2%
Triton X-100 in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS for 10 min at room
temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS and blocked with 10%
BSA/PBS solution for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated
with primary antibodies against p53, p53Ser20, or p21WAF1 (Cell Signaling
Technology) in 10% BSA/PBS solution at room temperature for 2 h. After
extensive washes, cells were incubated with Rhodamine Red X–conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG or Rhodamine Red X–conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(Jackson Immuno Research). DNA was then labeled with 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole(Sigma). Slides were finally mounted in a mounting medium
(Vector) and were visualized under Carl Zeiss invert Axiovert 200M
microscope with OpenLab 4.0.3 software (Improvision).
Temperature shifts and cell proliferation analysis. For the temperature shift experiment, 1  105 tsp53 transduced p53 / ;Fanca+/+ and
p53 / ;Fanca / MEF cells were cultured in triplicate in six-well tissue
culture plates. Plates were incubated at 37jC or 32jC. Every third day, cells
were trypsinized and counted with a hemacytometer, and the same number
of cells was replated in six-well tissue culture plates.
Senescence-associated B-galactosidase. Senescence-associated h-galactosidase (SA-h-gal) activity was determined using a SA-h-gal staining kit
(Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde.
Cells were further washed with PBS and stained with X-gal solution
(1 mg/mL X-gal) overnight at 37jC. The percentage of positive-stained cells
was quantified under a phase-contrast microscope.
Immunohistochemistry. Spleen, thymus, and bone were fixed with
formalin and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. After deparaffinization
and hydration, sections were blocked with 10% serum in PBS for 30 min
and then incubated with 1:50 diluted anti-p53 or 1:50 diluted anti-p21WAF1
(all from Santa Cruz Technologies) primary antibodies overnight at 4jC,
followed by three washing with PBS at 5-min interval. Detection of p53 and
p21WAF1 staining was performed using the biotin peroxidase complex
method (Vectastain ABC kits, Vector Laboratories). Color was developed
with diaminobenzidie tetrahydrochloride, and nuclei were stained with
hematoxylin.
Preparation of cell extracts and immunoblotting. To prepare cell
protein, single-cell suspension was prepared from BMMNCs, spleenocytes,
or trypsinized MEFs, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in ice-cold
lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), 0.1% NP40, and
1mol/L NaCl supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors
[10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 25 Ag/mL leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL pepstatin A, 2 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1mol/L NaP2O4, 25 mmol/L NaF, and

from the lysates by centrifuging them at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Protein
concentration was quantified by using Bio-Rad reagent. Cell lysates (100 Ag)
were resolved on (12%) SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. Immunoblots were then incubated with primary antibodies
specific for p53, p53Ser20, and p21WAF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), g H2AX

Results
Hematopoietic cells and MEFs from Fanca / mice are
hypersensitive to oxidants. Because FA patients have severe
defects in hematopoietic function and because it is not clear
whether the FA proteins function in oxidative stress response, we
used mice deficient for the FA complementation group A (Fanca)
gene to examine the sensitivity of primary FA cells to oxidative
stress. We first treated BMMNCs from Fanca / or their WT
littermates with increasing concentrations of the oxidant hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) and analyzed cell proliferation using the BrdUrd
incorporation assay. We observed that treated Fanca / cells
proliferated much slower than their WT counterparts (Fig. 1A, left).
Because FA hematopoietic failure is a direct consequence of
the defect in the hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor (HSC/P)
compartment, we tested whether the FA HSC/P cells were
hypersensitive to oxidative damage. Indeed, the number of colonies
formed by Fanca / HSC/P cells was markedly decreased with
100 Amol/L of H2O2, whereas WT HSC/P cells showed little effect
with H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1A, right).
We also established MEFs from Fanca / or WT mice and used
this well-established cell type as a cellular model system for the
evaluation of cellular and molecular alterations in oxidative
response in FA mutant cells. Similar to BMMNCs, the growth of
Fanca / MEFs was severely inhibited even at low concentrations
of H2O2, which had little effect on the proliferation of WT cells
(Fig. 1B). In addition, a sublethal dose (10 Amol/L) of H2O2 induced
premature senescence, as tested by SA-h-gal staining in Fanca /
MEFs (Fig. 1C). Together, these results indicate that loss of FA
function results in cellular hypersensitivity to oxidants.
Oxidative stress induces premature senescence by activating
several major signaling pathways, including the p16INK4A/pRB and
ADP ribosylation factor/p53 pathways (39). Oncogene Ras has also
been shown to induce cell growth arrest after oxidative injury by
activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
(40). We, therefore, examined the expression and activities of
proteins and enzymes in the Ras, p53, and pRB pathways. We did
not find significantly elevated Ha-Ras expression or the downstream activation of the MAPK kinases ERK and p38 in senescent
Fanca / cells treated with 10 Amol/L H2O2 (Fig. 1D, left),
suggesting that the Ras pathway was not responsible for the
10 Amol/L H2O2-induced premature senescence in Fanca / cells.
There was only a marginal increase in the expression of p16INK4A
and p19Arf, which was correlated with a decrease in phosphorylated
pRB, in response to 10 Amol/L H2O2 in both WT and Fanca / cells
as determined by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) or Western
blotting, respectively (Fig. 1D, middle and right). However, the
activity of p53, as reflected by its phosphorylation at Ser20 (p53Ser20,
which is a specific indicator of oxidative DNA damage; ref. 41) and
p21WAF1 expression, was significantly increased in senescent
Fanca / cells treated with 10 Amol/L H2O2 (Fig. 1D, right). These
results suggest that the p53 pathway may play a predominant role
in H2O2-induced premature senescence in Fanca / cells.
H2O2 induces G2-M cell cycle arrest and DNA double-strand
breaks in Fanca / BM cells. One hallmark of FA cells in
response to genotoxic stress is increased retardation of the cells at
the G2-M phase of the cell cycle (1–3). We thus examined whether
H2O2 induced abnormal G2-M cell cycle arrest in primary FA BM
cells. Indeed, H2O2-treated Fanca / BM cells displayed a
significant increase in the percentage of cells in G2-M compared
with H2O2-treated WT cells (Fig. 2A). Because G2 cell cycle arrest is

a major cellular response to DNA damage preceding the decision to
repair or enter mitosis and because FA cells are defective in the
repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; refs. 1–3), we determined
whether H2O2-treated Fanca / BM cells accumulated high levels
of DNA damage by examining the well-established DSB marker,
phosphorylated histone H2AX (gH2AX; ref. 42). As shown in
Fig. 2B, there was no significant accumulation of DSB in WT BM
cells, indicating that either the H2O2 treatments have little effect on
WT BM cells or DNA damage induced by H2O2 had been mostly
repaired in these WT BM cells. Strikingly, H 2O2 induced
significantly more DSB in Fanca / BM cells than in untreated
Fanca / or H2O2-treated WT BM cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, like
mitomycin C, H2O2 induces abnormal G2-M cell cycle arrest in
primary FA BM cells, possibly in a DNA damage-dependent
manner.
H2O2 overactivates DNA damage response in Fanca / cells
in vitro and in vivo. Reasoning that the abnormal G2-M
accumulation induced by H2O2 in Fanca / BM cells might have
resulted from the prolonged activation of the oxidative DNA
damage and DNA DSB checkpoints, we examined the expression of

p53 Stress Response in FA mice

several oxidative damage response molecules p53, p53Ser20, and
p21WAF1. We found increased expression of both the total and
activated forms (p53Ser20) of p53 in H2O2-treated Fanca / cells
compared with WT cells (Fig. 3A). Consistent with its activation,
p21WAF1, the target of p53, was up-regulated in H2O2-treated
Fanca / cells.
Next, we examined oxidative DNA damage response in vivo. For
this purpose, we injected (i.v.) H2O2 into WT and Fanca / mice
and examined the expression of p53, p53Ser20, and p21WAF1. Western
blot analysis showed that all these DNA damage response molecules
were elevated in response to H2O2 treatment in BM and spleen
harvested from Fanca / mice (Fig. 3B). Similar results were noticed
in the paraffin-embedded tissue sections of BM, spleen, and thymus
prepared from H2O2-treated mice (Fig. 3C). These results suggested
that loss of FA function causes strong oxidative DNA damage
response, possibly through up-regulation of the p53 pathway.
Kinetics of H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage response in
Fanca / mice. The observation that H2O2 induced strong DNA
damage response in Fanca / cells and tissues prompted us to

study the kinetics of H2O2-mediated p53 signaling in Fanca /
mice. We treated (through tail vein injection) WT and Fanca /
mice with a single dose (250 Amol/kg) of H2O2 and sacrificed the
injected animals 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after H2O2 injection.
The kinetics of DNA damage response in the BM and spleen of the
treated mice was analyzed for the expression of p53Ser20 and
gH2AX. As shown in Fig. 4, p53 activation (in the form of p53Ser20)
was short-lived in both marrow (Fig. 4A) and spleen (Fig. 4B) of
WT mice, which peaked at 4 hours but was decayed rapidly to
background level by 6 hours after H2O2 treatment. In Fanca /
mice, in contrast, high level of p53 activation was evident at 2 hours
and persisted for 24 hours postinjection. Although the expression
kinetics of gH2AX, a well-established DSB marker (42), varied
somewhat among the mouse tissues, Fanca / mice showed
prolonged expression of the DNA damage marker compared with
WT mice, in which gH2AX expression was undetectable by 12 to
24 hours after injection. Therefore, DNA damage response initiated
by oxidative stress is persistent in Fanca / mouse hematopoietic
tissues in vivo.

Figure 3. H2O2 overactivates DNA damage response in Fanca / cells in vitro and in vivo. A, WT or Fanca / mice were injected i.v. with H2O2 (250 Amol/kg body
weight) or with equal volume (100 AL) of PBS. The mice were then sacrificed 4 h later, and BM cells were isolated and stained for the p53Ser20, p53, or p21WAF1 proteins.
B, BM cells and splenocytes of PBS-treated or H2O2-treated WT and Fanca / mice, as described in A were analyzed for the expression of the p53Ser20, p53, or
p21WAF1 proteins by Western blotting. Total protein levels were normalized using h-actin as a control. C, paraffin-embedded BM, spleen, or thymus sections from
untreated or H2O2-treated mice were stained with the antibody against p53 or p21WAF1.

H2O2 (100 mmol/L) for 0, 4, or 8 h, and protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-gH2AX and antiactin antibodies.

The observation that H2O2-induced expression of the DSB
marker gH2AX seemed to be more pronounced and sustained in
the BM than in spleen raised the question as to whether there was
a lineage-specific effect on oxidative DNA damage in Fanca /
mice. To address this, we determined H2O2-induced DSBs in
lymphoid and myeloid cells (Fig. 4C) from the BM of Fanca /
mice. Whereas increased and prolonged expression of gH2AX was
seen in Fanca / cells compared with WT cells, no significant
difference in H2O2-induced DSBs was evident between lymphoid
and myeloid cells (Fig. 4D).

The dependency and persistence of p53-mediated response

explore the requirement for p53 activity and potential FA-p53
interaction in oxidative DNA damage response, we generated
Fanca / mice with the deletion of the Trp53 gene, isolated
primary MEFs from Fanca +/+;Trp53 / and Fanca / ;Trp53 /

mutant tsp53V143A, which can be reverted to functional state at
the permissive temperature of 32jC (43). The functional reversibility of the mutant tsp53V143A was verified by Western analysis,

p53 Stress Response in FA mice

demonstrating that H2O2 induced increased p21WAF1 expression in
all the tsp53V143A-expressing cells cultured at 32jC (Fig. 5A). A
prolonged time course analysis of cell growth indicated that, at
nonpermissive temperature (37jC), loss of p53 function almost
completely abolished growth response to H2O2 in cells with or
without the Fanca protein (Fig. 5B), suggesting that H2O2-induced
damage response requires a functional p53. Indeed, when the
function of p53 was restored at 32jC, H2O2-induced growth
inhibition was clearly evident in both Fanca+/+ and Fanca / cells
(Fig. 5C). However, we observed differential responses to H2O2induced stress in cells with different Fanca status. In Fanca+/+ cells,
the p53 response to oxidative stress seemed to be relatively short
(3–6 days) after the insult; whereas Fanca / cells underwent
prolonged growth inhibition (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, TUNEL assay
indicated that p53 deficiency increased H2O2-induced apoptosis in
Fanca / cells, which could be inhibited by functional tsp53V143A
(Fig. 5D). Thus, although p53 caused prolonged proliferative
suppression in Fanca / cells, a functional p53 seemed to be
required for the survival of the mutant cells under oxidative stress.
We next used the same cell system to explore the requirement
for p53 function in response to oncogenic stress, specifically
activated ras, which is a well-studied p53-antagonizing oncogene

(44). We infected tsp53V143A-expressing Fanca +/+;Trp53 / and
Fanca / ;Trp53 / MEFs with an H-Ras V12 retrovirus and
monitored cell proliferation at 32jC or 37jC for a period of
15 days. Growth kinetics showed that at 37jC, wherein p53 was
inactivated, all cell lines proliferated well regardless of the Fanca
genotype (Fig. 6A). When the cells were cultured at 32jC, wherein
p53 was functional, Fanca+/+ cells exhibited persistent response
to activated ras-induced growth arrest (Fig. 6A). Interestingly,
Fanca / cells initially responded to activated ras-triggered growth
arrest and then started to proliferate like p53-null cells after day 6.
These arrested cells expressed SA-h-gal and seemed morphologically senescent (Fig. 6B).
The interesting observation that Fanca-deficient cells failed to
respond to ras-induced growth arrest after 6 days of culture at
permissive temperature (32jC) suggested that Fanca / cells
might have lost their ability to engage p53 during constitutive
ras activation. To test this hypothesis, we cultured H-Ras V12transduced tsp53V143A-expressing cells at 37jC for either 3 or
12 days and then restored p53 function by shifting the cultures to
32jC. Cell proliferation and induction of p21WAF1 were analyzed by
BrdUrd incorporation and Western blot, respectively. Both cell lines
shifting to 32jC at day 3 underwent approximately same level of

Whereas p53 restoration at day 12 could still triggered immediate
growth arrest in Fanca+/+ ;Trp53 / cells; Fanca / ;Trp53 / cells

function during prolonged ras activation.

Discussion
Cellular stresses, most significantly oxidative DNA damage and
oncogene insults, have been shown to activate p53 (45). Given that p53
activation can lead to cell growth arrest or apoptosis, cancer cells, in
particular, must have developed strategies to regulate p53 activity. In
addition to the p53-negative regulator Mdm2, several p53-interacting
proteins have been shown to regulate p53 activity. The interaction of
p53 with other cellular proteins is known to influence the activity of
the tumor suppressor (46). Our finding that the Fanca protein coordinates with p53 to regulate oxidative and oncogenic stress responses
supports the notion that a fine control of p53 activity is fundamentally
important for cellular homeostasis and cancer prevention.
Patients with FA have an increased susceptibility to cancer, and
cells from FA patients are deficient in repair of DNA damage
induced by certain genotoxic agents. This suggests that the FA

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

proteins may interplay with other tumor suppressor pathways that
are involved in DNA damage repair and oncogenic signaling.
Encouraged by recent reports that p53 deficiency increases cancer
development in patients with FA and FA knockout mice (32–36),
we formally tested the hypothesis that the FA proteins may
functionally interact with the p53-activating signals in response to
oxidative and oncogenic stresses. Our results suggest that the
major FA protein, Fanca, may coordinate with p53 in regulation of
oxidative and oncogenic stress responses. This notion is supported
as follows: (a) the hypersensitive response to oxidative stress in
tissues in vivo and cells in vitro derived from Fanca / mice is
correlated with a persistent overactivation of the tumor suppressor
p53; (ii) the loss of Fanca function causes prolonged oxidative DNA
damage response through up-regulation of the p53 pathway; and
(c) the functional status of p53 dictates the kinetics and persistence
of response to oxidative and oncogenic stresses in these FA cells.
The mechanistic link between p53 signaling and FA has not been
well defined. The involvement of p53 in FA pathophysiology has
been highlighted by recent studies that show accelerated tumor
development in Fancd1, Fancd2, or Fancc mice, also deficient for
the Trp53 gene (34–36). Furthermore, developmental defects and
increased apoptosis in Fancd2-deficient zebrafish could be
corrected by p53 knockdown, suggesting that p53-dependent
apoptosis may be an underlying mechanism for the developmental

p53 Stress Response in FA mice

defect in the Fancd2 / fish (38). The current study establishes the
requirement for p53 signaling in oxidative and oncogenic stress
responses in Fanca-deficient cells. We have used primary MEFs
from Fanca+/+;Trp53 / and Fanca / ;Trp53 / mice combined
with a functionally switchable p53 mutant to define the kinetics,
dependence, and persistence of p53-mediated response to oxidative
and oncogenic stresses in FA cells. One important finding of our
study is that we observed different pattern of p53-dependent
response to H2O2-induced and deregulated oncogene-induced
stress in cells with different Fanca status. For instance, restoration
of p53 function elicited a transient response to oxidative stress in
Fanca+/+ cells, whereas Fanca / cells underwent prolonged p53dependent growth inhibition (Fig. 5). This persistent p53 engagement may be due to the fact that Fanca-deficient cells accumulated
high levels of oxidative DNA damage as a consequence of
impairment in DNA damage repair. We previously reported that
BM progenitor cells from Fancc / mice contained high levels of
oxidative DNA damage and exhibited persistent DNA damage
response (47). Thus, the prolonged p53 response in Fanca / cells
might have been induced by the unrepaired DNA damage, leading
to persistent DNA damage response.
Another interesting finding in the current study is that, although
activation of p53 by oxidative stress causes increased proliferative
suppression in Fanca / cells compared with WT cells (Fig. 1),
studies with the Fanca / ;Trp53 / double knockout cells
indicated that p53 deficiency increased H2O2-induced apoptosis in
Fanca / cells, which could be inhibited by functional tsp53V143A
(Fig. 5). Thus, a functional p53 seems to be required for the survival
of the mutant cells under oxidative stress. Circumstantial evidence
indicates that the selectivity of p53 to regulate the prosurvival or
proapoptotic signaling is affected by the growth environment, the
type of stress used, the cellular context, and differential expression
of the target genes (48, 49). In response to stress, p53 induces cell
growth arrest, thus preventing the damaged cells from further
replication (45, 50). More importantly, p53 can activate cell cycle
checkpoint in cells with damaged DNA, which allows cells to repair
the damage before reentering cell cycle. Indeed, it has been reported
that p53-null cells are more sensitive to mitotic catastrophe induced
by genotoxic drug (51, 52). Because H2O2-induced arrest in
Fanca / cells with a functional p53 occurs at the G2-M cell cycle
checkpoint, inactivation of p53 would lead to the impairment of the
checkpoint. Consequently, failure of the damaged Fanca / cells to
arrest at G2 would result in entry into mitosis and potential death
through mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis.
Patients with FA have high predisposition to leukemia and other
cancers. Whether FA cells have high susceptibility to oncogenic
transformation is not known. We have used an in vitro system in

which a functional p53 could be restored in Fanca / ;Trp53 /
cells to investigate the dynamic interplay between Fanca and p53 in
response to oncogenic stress. Whereas WT cells exhibit prolonged
response to oncogene activation, the p53-activating signals induced
by oncogenic ras were short-lived in Fanca / cells. Indeed,
when p53 function was restored 12 days after ras activation,
Fanca / ;Trp53 / cells showed lack of activated ras-induced
growth arrest and p21WAF1 expression (Fig. 6). This suggests that a
functional Fanca may be required for the cell to engage p53 during
constitutive ras activation. In contrast to oxidative DNA damage,
which triggers p53 activation only transiently, activated Ras elicits
persistent p53-activating signals in WT cells. Furthermore, our
results show that the Fanca function is required to maintain p53
response to Ras-induced growth arrest, as restoration of p53
function after 12 days of constitutive ras activation failed to
suppress proliferation of cells deficient in Fanca.
In conclusion, our results derived from both in vivo and in vitro
studies using the restorable p53 model shed new light on the
potential interplay between p53 and the FA pathway during cellular
response to oxidative and oncogenic stresses. Our studies also
define the important kinetic difference between WT and FA cells
during prolonged response to oxidative DNA damage and activated
oncogene signals. Additional studies into functional interaction
between the p53 and FA pathways in DNA damage and oncogenic
stress response may aid us in better understanding on how cells
can bypass the normal checkpoints and continue to proliferate in
the presence of damaged DNA and oncogenic activation. In the
context of FA, new insights on the role of the FA proteins in
oxidative DNA damage response/repair and oncogene activation
can suggest new pathways and proteins to target for therapeutic
prevention of cancer progression of the disease.
