Abstract
Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in
gastric carcinogenesis. Enzastaurin is an oral ATP-competitive
inhibitor of the PKCB isozyme. Although enzastaurin was
initially advanced to the clinic based on its antiangiogenic
activity, it is also known to have a direct effect on a variety of
human cancer cells, inducing apoptosis by inhibiting the Akt
signal pathway. However, data on enzastaurin for gastric
cancer are limited. Therefore, this study was performed to
assess the antitumor activity of enzastaurin on gastric cancer
cells and to investigate the underlying antitumor mechanisms.
Enzastaurin suppressed the proliferation of cultured gastric
cancer cells and the growth of gastric carcinoma xenografts.
Enzastaurin did not have an effect on gastric cancer cell cycle
progression; however, it had a direct apoptosis-inducing
effect through the caspase-mediated mitochondrial pathway.
Glycogen synthase kinase 3B phosphorylation, a reliable
pharmacodynamic marker of enzastaurin activity, and Akt
phosphorylation were both decreased after treatment with
enzastaurin. Although the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk) was
also dephosphorylated, Erk phosphorylation was not affected
in the enzastaurin-treated gastric cancer cells. Enzastaurin
activated Bad, one of the Bcl-2 proapoptotic proteins, through
dephosphorylation at Ser112, and depletion of Bad activity
resulted in resistance to enzastaurin-induced apoptosis and
cytotoxicity in gastric cancer cells. These data suggest that
enzastaurin induces apoptosis through Rsk-mediated and Badmediated pathways, besides inhibiting the Akt signal cascade.
Furthermore, enzastaurin had synergistic or additive effects
when combined with 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, paclitaxel,
or irinotecan. These results warrant further clinical investigation of enzastaurin for gastric cancer treatment. [Cancer Res

common malignancies in South America, in many former Eastern
European countries, and across Asia. In Korea, according to statistics reported in 2005, gastric cancer was the most prevalent
cancer in men (1). Although chemotherapy is commonly used in
clinical practice, the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer is still
poor and treatment is usually unsuccessful. In breast, lung, and
colorectal cancers, the identification of novel molecular targets
and the development of therapies specific to these targets have
provided successful new approaches to treatment in clinical practice. However, targeted therapy has not been successful in the
treatment of gastric cancer, and attempts to develop and apply new
agents are urgently needed.
The protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway, which functions
through serine/threonine kinase activity, plays a key role in tumorinduced angiogenesis, tumor growth, differentiation, cytokine
secretion, migration, and apoptosis and is a possible target for
anticancer therapy (2, 3). PKC activation contributes to tumor cell
survival and proliferation and, as such, has been implicated
repeatedly in the malignant progression of human cancers, such as
B-cell lymphoma (4), malignant gliomas (2), and colorectal
carcinomas (5–7). PKC is stimulated by vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) receptor activation and is an important
mediator of VEGF, the most potent angiogenic factor identified in
a variety of solid tumors (8).
Gastric cancer tumor tissue possesses a higher level of PKC
activity than normal tissue (9). Two highly specific PKC inhibitors
(RO-31-8220 and chelerythrine) have been shown to suppress the
growth of gastric cancer cells through apoptosis induction and cell
cycle quiescence (10). PKC has been implicated as having an
important role in the development of invasive activity in gastric
cancer (11). Recently, it was reported that the antisense targeting
PKCa and PKCh1 markedly inhibited gastric cancer cell growth
and made gastric cancer cells more responsive to mitomycin
C–induced or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)–induced apoptosis (12). Given
its proposed key role in tumorigenesis, PKC may be a promising
target for gastric cancer growth inhibition.
Enzastaurin (LY317615.HCl), an acyclinc bisindolylmaleimide,
was initially developed as an ATP-competitive selective inhibitor
of PKCh (13). In addition to its major target PKCh, enzastaurin
also potently inhibits other PKC isoforms, including PKCy, PKCq,
PKCg, and PKCa (14). Although enzastaurin was initially developed
for antiangiogenic cancer therapy (15), recent preclinical studies
have shown that enzastaurin has a direct effect on a variety of
human cancer cells, inducing apoptosis (14, 16–18). Enzastaurin
was also shown to target the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/
Akt pathway and to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK3h)

phosphorylation (14). Based on these promising preclinical findings, a phase I clinical study that found that enzastaurin at 525 mg
once daily was the recommended dose for further clinical trials was
completed. At this 525 mg daily dose, a steady-state plasma concentration of enzastaurin and its analytes reached up to 8 Amol/L,
with the a mean plasma exposure of 2.2 Amol/L (3). Currently,
enzastaurin is being evaluated in several phase II or phase III
clinical trials.
However, the role of enzastaurin in gastric cancer remains
unknown. The results of our study show that enzastaurin is cytotoxic to gastric cancer cells. These findings strongly support further
clinical evaluation of enzastaurin. Furthermore, our data show that
enzastaurin induces gastric cancer cell apoptosis by a mechanism
not previously reported through the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk)
and Bad-mediated pathways, in addition to inhibiting the Akt signaling cascade.

Materials and Methods
Drugs and Reagents
Enzastaurin was provided by Eli Lilly Company. Other chemotherapeutic
drugs were obtained as follows: 5-FU and cisplatin from Choongwae
Pharma Company, paclitaxel from BMS Korea, and irinotecan from CJ
Pharmaceutical Company. Enzastaurin was initially dissolved in DMSO
(Sigma Chemical Co.) at a concentration of 5 mmol/L and stored in small
aliquots at 20jC.
Antibodies to caspase-3, caspase-9, Erk, phosphorylated Erk, Akt,
phosphorylated Akt, p90 Rsk, phosphorylated Rsk (Thr359/Ser363), GSK3h,
phosphorylated GSK3h, Bad, phosphorylated Bad (Ser112), and phosphorylated Bad (Ser136) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Antibodies to caspase-8 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were
provided by BD PharMingen. Antibodies to Bax, Bak, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and
cytochrome c were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody
to Bcl-2 was from DakoCytomation.

Cell Lines and Culture
Human gastric cancer cell lines (SNU-1, SNU-5, SNU-16, SNU-216, SNU484, SNU-601, SNU-620, SNU-638, SNU-668, and SNU-719) were obtained
from the Korea Cell Line Bank (19) and grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (10 Ag/mL). All cell lines were
incubated under standard culture conditions (20% O2 and 5% CO2; 37jC).

Cell Growth Inhibition Assays
Tetrazolium dye [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide, MTT; Sigma] assays were used to evaluate the growth inhibitory
effects of enzastaurin, as described in prior studies (20, 21). Cells were
seeded on 96-well plates, incubated for 24 h, and then treated with drugs for
72 h at 37jC. After drug treatment, MTT solution was added to each well
and incubated for 4 h at 37jC before the medium was removed. DMSO was
then added and shaken for 30 min at room temperature. Cell viability was
determined by measuring absorbance at 550 nm in a microplate reader
(Spectra Classic, Tecan Co.). Experiments were performed in groups of six
for each drug concentration and were repeated thrice.

Xenograft Mouse Model
To determine the in vivo activity of enzastaurin, 6-wk-old female athymic
nude mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.) were injected s.c. in the back with
SNU-16 or SNU-484 cells in 100 AL PBS. When the tumor reached 100 mm3,
enzastaurin was suspended in 10% acacia (Fisher Scientific) in water and
given at a dose of 75 mg/kg by oral gavage twice daily. Control groups were
treated only with vehicle. Tumor burden was measured twice a week with
a caliper (calculated volume = length  width  height  p / 6).

were washed with PBS, digested with RNase A (50 Ag/mL) for 15 min at
37jC, and then stained with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL). The cell DNA
contents (10,000 cells per experimental group) were determined using
a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Biosciences) equipped
with a ModFit LT program (Verity Software House, Inc.), as previously
described (20).

Annexin V Binding Assay for Apoptosis
After the cells were exposed to enzastaurin for 72 h, the degree of
apoptosis was assessed by the Annexin V binding assay as instructed by the
manufacturer (BD PharMingen). The harvested cell suspension was
incubated with Annexin V for 15 min at room temperature in the
dark and then analyzed by flow cytometry, as described previously (20).
Single-variable analysis, which used Annexin V–FITC only, was performed
due to the self-fluorescence of enzastaurin within the propidium iodide
spectrum.

Terminal Deoxyribonucleotidyl Transferase–Mediated dUTP
Nick End Labeling Assay for Apoptosis
Three core tissue biopsies (4 mm in diameter) were taken from each
individual paraffin-embedded tissue sample (donor blocks) and arranged in
a new recipient paraffin block (tissue array block) using a trephine
apparatus (Superbiochips Laboratories). Each tissue array block contained
samples of all animals. Sections of 4 Am were cut from each triplicate tissue
array blocks, deparaffinized, and dehydrated. Immunohistochemical
detection of apoptosis was carried out using an Apoptag in situ Apoptosis
Detection kit (Chemicon International) following the procedures provided
by the manufacturer.

Western Blot Analysis
Cultured cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and suspended in an
extraction buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmol/L pepstatin A, 0.1 mmol/L antipain,
0.1 mmol/L chymostatin, 0.2 mmol/L leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin,
0.5 mg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mmol/L benzamidine] on ice
for 15 min. Samples containing equal amounts of total protein were
resolved in a SDS-polyacrylamide denaturing gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies. Detection was performed
using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech).
For total protein extraction from frozen tissue, mouse tissues frozen in
liquid nitrogen after excision were powdered with mortar and pestle.
Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 8.0),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodum
dodecyl sulfate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin,
and 1 Ag/mL pepstatin] was added to powdered tissue. Samples were
vortexed and then incubated for 45 min on ice. Samples were homogenized
and centrifuged at 14,000  g for 10 min. Then, Western blot analysis was
performed using the same method.

Analysis of Cytochrome c Release
For detecting the mitochondrial cytochrome c release into the cytosol,
cells were harvested at each experimental time point, resuspended with
isotonic isolation buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 250 mmol/L
sucrose (pH 7.6)], and collected by centrifugation. Cells were then
suspended in hypotonic isolation buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 50 mmol/L sucrose (pH 7.6)] and disrupted by passing through
a 27-gauge needle 5 to 10 times. After adding hypertonic isolation
buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 450 mmol/L sucrose
(pH 7.6)] to balance the tonicity of the buffer, cells were centrifuged at
16,000  g for 20 min, and the supernatant was used for the cytosol protein extraction.

GACGAGTTTGTGGACTCCTTT; Qiagen Co.) were used in this experiment,
and a nonspecific siRNA (nonhomologous to any known gene sequence)
was used as a negative control. SNU-620 cells were transfected with these
siRNAs for 4 h using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol and recovered in fresh medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum for 12 h. Cells were then treated with enzastaurin
or DMSO, and the proportion of apoptotic cells (sub-G1 fraction) was
determined by flow cytometry.

Analysis of Drug Combination Effects (Isobologram
Analysis)
Analyses of drug interactions were performed by constructing an
envelope of additivity using the isobologram method of Steel and Peckham,
as described previously (21, 22). Based on available dose-response curves,
the combined effects of enzastaurin and other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents were analyzed at IC50. Three isoeffect curves were drawn as
follows.
Mode I line. When the dose of drug A is chosen, there remains
an increment of effect to be produced by drug B. If two drugs were to
act independently, the addition is performed by taking the increase in
doses, starting from 0, that give log survivals which add up to IC50 (heteroaddition).
Mode II(A) line. When the dose of drug A is chosen, an isoeffect curve
can also be calculated by taking the dose increment of drug B that gives the
required contribution to the total effect up to the limit, in this case, IC50
(isoaddition).
Mode II(B) line. Similarly, when the dose of drug B is chosen, an
isoeffect curve can be calculated by taking the dose increment of drug A
that gives the required contribution to IC50 (isoaddition).
With combination of graded doses of drug A and a chosen dose of
drug B, a single dose-response curve can be drawn. When the experimental
IC50 concentration in this drug combination falls left of the envelope
(Supplementary Fig. S1, point P1), the two drugs have supraadditive
(synergistic) interaction. When the experimental data point is within the
envelope, the combination is considered to be noninteractive (additive;
Supplementary Fig. S1, point P2). Finally, when the data point is in the area
to the right of the envelope, the combination is considered to be antagonistic (Supplementary Fig. S1, point P3 or point P4).
Actual IC50 values were obtained from growth inhibition curves after
cancer cells were exposed to a variety of concentrations of enzastaurin or
other cytotoxic agents, alone or in combination. When combined, two drugs
were applied simultaneously for 72 h.
Statistical analysis. Comparison of quantification of terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay or
percentage of surviving cells were analyzed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test
or Student’s t test. Statistical analysis to compare tumor sizes in xenograftbearing mice was performed with Student’s two-tailed t test. Differences
between groups were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05.

Results
Enzastaurin suppresses gastric cancer cell proliferation
in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. Although enzastaurin
was initially introduced for clinical development due to its antiangiogenic activity, it was also shown to have a direct antiproliferative effect on human tumor cells (14). We therefore evaluated
the ability of enzastaurin to suppress gastric cancer cell proliferation in culture. Indeed, enzastaurin suppressed the proliferation of gastric cancer cells and showed a wide variety of IC50
values. SNU-620 cells were the most sensitive to enzastaurin (IC50,
3.56 Amol/L) and SNU-1, SNU-5, SNU-16, and SNU-484 cells had
a low micromolar range of IC50 values (3.78–6.35 Amol/L). However, enzastaurin was not very cytotoxic with SNU-216 and SNU719 with IC50 values of >250 Amol/L after 72 hours of exposure
(Fig. 1A).

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

We next sought to assess the in vivo efficacy of enzastaurin
using a mouse model of human gastric cancer. The phase I clinical
trials for enzastaurin have shown that p.o. administration at
525 mg/d yields f2 Amol/L mean steady-state plasma exposure of
enzastaurin and its analytes (3). In the tumor xenograft-bearing
mice, plasma enzastaurin concentration is f2 Amol/L at a dose
of 75 mg/kg given p.o. by gavage twice daily (14). At this dose of
enzastaurin, tumor growth in the enzastaurin-treated group was
significantly suppressed compared with the control group in the
SNU-484 xenograft-bearing mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 1B). Enzastaurin
treatment also significantly suppressed the growth of SNU-16
gastric cancer xenograft (P < 0.05; data not shown).
Enzastaurin inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation without cell cycle specificity and induces direct apoptosis. After
demonstrating that enzastaurin had antiproliferative effects on
gastric cancer cells, we next sought to examine the effects of
enzastaurin on cell cycle progression. The cell cycle profiles of the
gastric cancer cells were analyzed, and enzastaurin was found to
have little effect on the cell cycle progression of SNU-620 and SNU484. However, the sub-G1 population increased with the passage of
time and in a dose-dependent manner after enzastaurin treatment;
this result suggests that enzastaurin induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A).
Protein profiling of enzastaurin-treated gastric cancer cells showed
cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. The amount of cleaved forms of
these proteins increased in a time-dependent and dose-dependent
manner after enzastaurin treatment (Fig. 2B, top). Consistent with
these data, the Annexin V binding assay confirmed a dosedependent enzastaurin-induced apoptosis in SNU-620 and SNU-484
cells (Fig. 2B, bottom left). Taken together, these analyses show that
enzastaurin induced direct apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells
in the low micromolar range (2.5–10 Amol/L) without cell cycle–
specific inhibition.
The effects of enzastaurin therapy on tumor cell apoptosis
were also examined in a xenograft mouse model (SNU-484). In
Western blot analysis using protein extraction from frozen
xenograft tumors, the induction of caspase-3 activation was shown
in enzastaurin-treated SNU-484 xenograft-bearing mice (Fig. 2B,
bottom right). We also performed TUNEL assay on paraffinembedded xenograft tumors and used tissue arrays, which allowed
direct comparison between tissues from different animal groups.
The results of TUNEL assay indicated increased levels of apoptosis
in enzastaurin-treated animals compared with control animals
(P < 0.05; Fig. 2C).
Enzastaurin activates the mitochondrial pathway during
apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Two major apoptotic pathways,
the death receptor pathway (extrinsic pathway) and the mitochondrial pathway (intrinsic pathway), have been well characterized in
mammalian cells. Over the course of these pathways, activation of
the death receptor first triggers caspase-8 activation, whereas the
release of mitochondrial cytochrome c activates caspase-9 as an
initial caspase, all of which subsequently induce the activation of
effector caspases, such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 (23).
As shown in Fig. 2B, caspase-3 was activated in gastric cancer cells,
and, thus, we next examined the activation of initiator caspases
(caspase-8 and caspase-9) in enzastaurin-treated SNU-620 cells.
Although active fragments of caspase-8 or caspase-9 were not
detected in the Western blotting, the amount of the caspase-9
proform decreased with time. This result suggests that enzastaurininduced apoptosis is associated with the activation of caspase-9.
However, the amount of the caspase-8 proform did not change
after enzastaurin treatment (Fig. 2D, left). In addition, enzastaurin

induced the cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the
cytosol in SNU-620 cells (Fig. 2D, right). These results show that
enzastaurin treatment led gastric cancer cells to undergo apoptosis
through a mitochondrial pathway.
The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bax and Bak) have been
shown to be required for the disruption of mitochondria and
intrinsic death of cancer cells, whereas the antiapoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1) can prevent cell death by
interfering with the action of Bax and Bak. Therefore, the change in
the expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins was examined after
treating the SNU-620 or SNU-484 cells with DMSO or enzastaurin.
The expression levels of Bax and Bak were not changed after
enzastaurin treatment in both cell lines. Enzastaurin suppressed
both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expression at 2.5 Amol/L in the SNU-620 cells
but had no effect on these proteins in the SNU-484 cells. The levels
of Mcl-1 were not significantly changed at 2.5 to 5 Amol/L of
enzastaurin, but were suppressed at a higher dose of enzastaurin
(10 Amol/L) in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Enzastaurin blocks phosphorylation of Akt and p90 Rsk.
We sought to examine whether pathways known to be influenced
by PKC activity might be affected in gastric cancer cells by enzastaurin treatment. PKC activity has been connected to many
intracellular signaling pathways, including the ras-Erk signaling
axis and the PI3K/Akt pathway (14). Although Rsk is activated
by Erk, Rsk can also be influenced by a PKC-dependent and
Erk-independent pathway (24–26). In a previous report, treatment
of HCT116 colon cancer cells and U87MG glioblastoma cells with
enzastaurin failed to inhibit Erk activity, but enzastaurin inhibited
Akt phosphorylation in these cell lines (14). Similarly, treatment
of SNU-620 and SNU-484 cells with enzastaurin did not suppress
Erk activity in the Western blot analysis. By contrast, enzastaurin
showed a clear concentration-dependent reduction of AktSer473
and RskThr359/Ser363 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Enzastaurin also
suppressed the expression of phosphorylated GSK3h, a downstream target of the Akt pathway, in both gastric cancer cell lines
(Fig. 3B).

at two critical sites, Ser112 and Ser136, which leads to the
dissociation of Bad from prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and the
association of Bad with members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins
(27). The regulation of Bad by these phosphorylation events
suggests that Bad is a point of convergence for multiple signaling
pathways that cooperate in cell death or survival. Akt phosphorylates Bad on Ser136, whereas Erk or Rsk phosphorylate Bad on
Ser112, respectively (24–26). Because enzastaurin suppressed the
phosphorylation of Akt and Rsk, we next evaluated whether
Bad activity was affected in enzastaurin-treated gastric cancer
cells using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, Ser112
phosphorylation of Bad was readily detectable and decreased in

a concentration-dependent manner after enzastaurin treatment.
Because Erk phosphorylation was not decreased in enzastaurintreated cells (Fig. 3A), enzastaurin-induced Rsk dephosphorylation
is thought to activate Bad via dephosphorylation of Bad at Ser112.
These data suggest that activation of Bad through its dephosphorylation at Ser112 is a crucial mechanism for enzastaurin-mediated
gastric cancer cell apoptosis.
To confirm the direct involvement of Bad in enzastaurin-induced
apoptotic cell death, we analyzed the effect of silencing endogenous Bad protein by siRNA in SNU-620 cells. Transfections of two
independent siRNAs targeting Bad (Bad1 and Bad2) strongly
silenced endogenous Bad, compared with transfections of nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4B). When SNU-620 cells were transfected with

Bad siRNAs, the extent of enzastaurin-induced apoptosis and
cytotoxicity were markedly reduced compared with those cells
transfected with the control siRNA (Fig. 4C and D). Taken together,
these results suggest that enzastaurin-induced apoptosis and
cytotoxicity in gastric cancer cells were mediated through Bad
activation via the Rsk pathway.
Enzastaurin is also known to exert its anticancer activity by
inhibiting signals through the Akt pathway (14, 17, 18); our data also
showed decreased phosphorylation of Akt in enzastaurin-treated
gastric cancer cells (Fig. 3A). However, although the phosphorylated
Bad (Ser136) antibody readily detected the phosphorylated Bad
control protein ( from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), the Bad
protein phosphorylated at Ser136 from the extracts of gastric cancer cells was not detected (data not shown). Thus, the association between the Akt pathway and the Bad activity could not be
confirmed.
The combination of enzastaurin and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs shows additive or synergistic activity in gastric
cancer cells. The combined effects of enzastaurin and cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agents (5-FU, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and irinotecan) were tested using the isobologram method in SNU-620 and
SNU-484 cells (Fig. 5). The simultaneous exposure of enzastaurin
and these additional cytotoxic agents over a period of 72 hours
produced additive or synergistic interactions.

Discussion
PKC is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate
growth factor response, tumor cell proliferation, and apoptosis.
PKC therefore represents an attractive and promising target for
cancer treatment. Although implicated in gastric cancer pathogenesis, the therapeutic value of targeting the PKC signaling pathway in gastric cancer is to date unknown. We therefore investigated
the cytotoxicity and antitumor effects of enzastaurin in gastric
cancer. Although SNU-216 and SNU-719 were resistant to enzastaurin, growth of other gastric cancer cells was effectively inhibited by enzastaurin. Specially, SNU-1, SNU-5, SNU-16, SNU-484,

and SNU-620 had a low micromolar range of IC50 values (3.78–
6.35 Amol/L; Fig. 1A); this range was similar to that of colon carcinoma, glioblastoma, prostate cancer, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,
and myeloma cell lines (14, 17, 18). When combined with cytotoxic agents commonly used in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, enzastaurin showed synergistic or additive activities
at clinically significant concentrations (1–3 Amol/L), as shown in
Fig. 5. Oral dosing with enzastaurin to yield plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in clinical trials also significantly
suppressed the growth of human gastric cancer cell xenografts
(Fig. 1B).
To date, there is no report on the effects of enzastaurin on
cancer cell cycle progression. In a previous report, stauroporine
and its analogues with high specificity for PKC had differential
effects on cell cycle progression in A549 lung cancer cells.
Staurosporine and UCN-01 retarded A549 cells in G0-G1. However,
CGP 41251 had no effect on any phase of the A549 cell cycle,
as enzastaurin inhibited SNU-620 and SNU-484 cell growth in a
noncycle-specific manner (Fig. 2A). These findings show that PKC
inhibitors differ with respect to the mechanisms by which they
interfere with the cell cycle (28). Our data suggest that enzastaurin
induces in vitro cell growth inhibition in gastric cancer through
direct induction of apoptosis without affecting cell cycle progression. This apoptotic induction by enzastaurin was mediated
through the activation of caspases in the gastric cancer cells. The
increased level of the cytosolic cytochrome c protein and the
decreased level of caspase-9 proform, after enzastaurin treatment, reveal that a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was involved
in enzastaurin-induced gastric cancer cell death (Fig. 2D).
Enzastaurin-induced apoptosis was also shown in tumor xenograft-bearing mice (Fig. 2B and C). In MM.1S myeloma cells, downregulation of Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, was observed after
enzastaurin treatment (2.5–5 Amol/L; ref. 16). However, Mcl-1
expression levels were not changed significantly at 2.5 to 5 Amol/L
of enzastaurin in SNU-620 and SNU-484 cells, but its expression
was suppressed at a higher dose (10 Amol/L). Both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL
expression in SNU-620 cells were decreased at lower doses of

showed that the expression of phosphorylated Akt and GSK3h,
one of the Akt downstream targets, was decreased by enzastaurin
treatment. They also suggested that GSK3h is a reliable pharmacodynamic marker for enzastaurin activity (14, 17, 18). Akt
activation, which is mediated through phosphorylation, maintains
a survival signal that protects cells from apoptosis by phosphorylating proapoptotic proteins, such as caspase-9, Bad, and the
cell regulatory protein GSK3h; in addition to indirectly modulating
p53 and nuclear factor-nB, it also mediates growth factor–induced

cell proliferation (18). Therefore, suppression of Akt phosphorylation may be an important mechanism associated with enzastaurininduced tumor cell death. However, experiments with in vitro
kinase assays showed that enzastaurin caused virtually no inhibition of Akt (14). Thus, it was suggested that enzastaurin may
indirectly suppress the Akt signaling pathway through its inhibitory
effect on PKC proteins (14). However, the mechanisms underlying enzastaurin activity, linking the PKC and Akt pathways, are still
unknown and remain to be elucidated.

Enzastaurin in Human Gastric Cancer

Figure 5 Continued.

In our study, the expression of both phosphorylated Akt and
GSK3h was also decreased by enzastaurin treatment; this finding
is consistent with previous reports. Additionally, our experiments
showed a new mechanism involved in enzastaurin-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells—the Bad pathway. Bad is one of the
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member proteins and is inactivated
by phosphorylation at two critical sites, Ser112 and Ser136. When
phosphorylated at Ser112 or Ser136, Bad is complexed to the cytosolic 14-3-3 protein and fails to interact with the antiapoptotic

www.aacrjournals.org

Bcl-XL protein, thus favoring cell survival (27). In our experiments,
Bad activation (dephosphorylation) was confirmed in enzastaurintreated gastric cancer cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, the depletion of
Bad conferred resistance to enzastaurin-induced apoptosis and
cytotoxicity in the gastric cancer cells (Fig. 4C and D). Because Erk
phosphorylation was not decreased, dephosphorylation of Bad at
Ser112 is thought to be mediated by Rsk inactivation in enzastaurintreated gastric cancer cells (24–26). However, a phosphorylated
Bad at Ser136, which is mediated by the Akt pathway, was not

efficient Bad phosphorylation at Ser136 in normal melanocytes,
whereas it was only minimally detected in melanoma cell lines,
although the levels of Bad protein were similar in the two cell types
(29). Another study reported a similar phenomenon (30). Thus,
the association between Akt and Bad cannot be confirmed in our
study; further investigation of the mechanisms underlying Aktassociated apoptotic induction in enzastaurin-treated cancer cells
need to be performed. Suggesting mechanisms for enzastaurininduced apoptosis in gastric cancer, including the newly identified Rsk-mediated and Bad-mediated pathways, are illustrated in
Fig. 6.
In summary, enzastaurin induced gastric cancer cell death via
mitochondria and caspase-mediated pathways without cell cycle
specificity. We showed that enzastaurin induced apoptosis in
gastric cancer cells via a newly identified mechanism through Rskmediated and Bad-mediated pathways, in addition to the Akt
signaling cascade. Furthermore, enzastaurin had synergistic or
additive activity with other cytotoxic agents in gastric cancer cells.
Our data provide a platform for further evaluation of the novel and
orally available PKCh inhibitor, enzastaurin, as a potential
therapeutic agent for the treatment of gastric cancer.

apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Enzastaurin inhibits PKC activity and

detected in our experiments. One explanation for this finding is
that the expression of phosphorylated Bad at Ser136 in gastric
cancer cells is below the limit of detection with the antibody we
have used ( from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). However, weak
or absent phosphorylation on Ser136 might be a common
phenomenon shared by diverse tumor cells. One study showed
