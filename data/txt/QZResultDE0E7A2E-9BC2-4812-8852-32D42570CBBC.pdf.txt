ABSTRACT
2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME) is a physiological metabolite of 17β-estradiol. At
pharmacological concentrations, 2-ME inhibits colon, breast and lung cancer in tumor
models. Here we investigated the effect of physiologically relevant concentrations
of 2-ME in osteosarcoma cell model. We demonstrated that 2-ME increased nuclear
localization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, resulting in nitro-oxidative DNA
damage. This in turn caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells.
We suggest that 2-ME is a naturally occurring hormone with potential anti-cancer
properties.

concentration of 2.17 × 10−7 M. The minimum estimated
target concentration of 2-ME is 1.1 × 10−8 M, which is
considered as a high physiological concentration [13, 14].
Multiple clinical trials have used 2-ME as an efficient
therapeutic agent for several types of cancer [7, 13–17].
In contrast, there are only a few studies concerning the
physiological activity of 2-ME [5, 6, 53]. In spite of its
proven anticancer activity, the molecular mechanisms
of 2-ME remain unclear. Preclinical studies suggest that
2-ME directly inhibits angiogenesis and induces apoptosis
in tumorous and rapidly proliferating cells. 2-ME induces
both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways associated
with the overexpression of p53 [18, 19, 20]. Additionally, it
takes part in stress-induced apoptosis due to the generation
of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species
[21–23]. Our previous study demonstrated that the anticancer
effects of 2-ME are associated with the selective increase
in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) within highly
metastatic osteosarcoma (OS) 143B cells [21]. In 2002, Su

INTRODUCTION
2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME) is a physiological
metabolite of 17β-estradiol (E2). It is synthesized through
the hydroxylation and O-methylation of E2 at the 2-position
[1, 2]. Serum levels of 2-ME range from 3 × 10−11 M in men
to as much as over 3 × 10−8 M in pregnant women [3–6].
Pharmacological concentrations of 2-ME (10−7 – 10−5 M)
inhibit cancer in various experimental models. In vitro and
in vivo models revealed that 2-ME inhibited growth of colon
[7], breast [8, 9], lung [10] cancer as well as endothelial cells
[11, 12]. 2-ME (branded as Panzem) is currently recognized
as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth [7,
13–17]. Recommended oral dose of 2-ME is 1000 mg,
4 times a day [14]. Treatment with 2-ME NanoCrystal
dispersion enhanced clinical benefit rate due to the
improved bioavaibility of the compound and is preferably
used in clinical practice [14, 15]. Steady-state Cmax

and co-workers reported that microtubule-disturbing agents,
including 2-ME, modify NO generation [24]. Nitric oxide
synthases (NOSs) are a group of hemoproteins that catalyze
the oxidation of L-arginine to citrulline, releasing a molecule
of nitric oxide NO (II) [25]. At least 3 isoforms of NOS have
been distinguished: neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS,
NOS 1, NOS I), found mainly in neurons; inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS, NOS 2, NOS II), induced by factors
such as stress or inflammation; and endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS, NOS 3, NOS III), expressed mainly in
endothelial cells [25]. The regulatory mechanisms controlling
the expression and localization of nNOS are very complex.
Though nNOS is usually found within the cytosol, it may be
also recruited to the nucleus [26, 27, 28]. The reasons for the
nuclear recruitment of nNOS remain unclear.
In our study, we investigated the anticancer effects
of 2-ME at physiologically and pharmacologically relevant
concentrations in osteosarcoma (OS) cell models. OS is
one of the most common bone cancers of childhood and
adolescence. It is characterized by the formation of immature
bone structures or osteoid tissue by cancerous cells [29,
30, 31]. In the light of many studies, 2-ME can become a
potent and relatively safe treatment for OS patients [19, 32,
33, 34, 35]. Here, we showed that the anticancer properties
of 2-ME may be explained by DNA damage caused by
generation of nitric oxide (NO). 2-ME increased nuclear
localization of nNOS in OS cells, possibly causing nuclear NO
production. Thus, 2-ME could be considered as a naturally
occurring hormone of potential oncostatic properties.

Effect of physiological and pharmacological
relevant concentrations of 2-ME on OS 143B
cell death
Our first goal was to determine the influence of
physiological (10−12 M – 10−8 M) and pharmacological
(10−7 M – 10−5 M) relevant concentrations of 2-ME on
induction of cell death within 143B OS cells. These
concentrations were determined from the available
literature data [3–6, 19, 21, 33, 42–47]. Previously, we
demonstrated that 2-ME inhibited cell growth and induced
cell death in hippocampal (HT22) and OS (143B) cell
lines at high pharmacological concentrations [21]. Herein,
the cells were treated with different concentrations (10−12
M – 10−5 M) of 2-ME for 24 h. Induction of apoptosis
and necrosis was determined by flow cytometry. 2-ME
induced apoptosis in 143B OS cells not only at tested
pharmacological relevant concentrations (10−7 M – 10−5 M),
but also at physiological concentrations (10−10 M – 10−8 M)
(Figure 1A). At least 10% of apoptotic 143B cells
were observed in the presence of 2-ME ranging from
concentrations of 10−10 M to 10−6 M. While, treatment of
143B OS with 10−5 M 2-ME resulted in a dramatic 40%
increase in apoptotic cell number in comparison to the
control (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, we did not observe
any induction of necrosis by physiological relevant
concentrations of 2-ME (Figure 1B). Necrosis of 143B OS

cells was observed only under pharmacological relevant
concentrations (10−6 M and 10−5 M) of 2-ME (Figure 1B).
This is consistent with our previous study [21].

nuclear fraction of nNOS was elevated after stimulation
with all used concentrations of 2-ME (Figure 2A–2C).
Significant increases were observed in the level of nNOS
in nuclei of 143B cells after 2 h and 6 h of incubation
with 10−8 M 2-ME. Treatment with pharmacological
relevant concentrations (10−7 M, and 10−6 M) resulted
in nuclear nNOS localization after 6 h and 8 h of
incubation (Figure 2A). These data are in agreement
with the observed increase in the total level of nNOSα
(Figure 2C). Inhibition of 143B OS cell growth by 10−6
M of 2-ME was significantly reversed after adding
L-NDBA, an nNOS inhibitor (Nω-Nitroarginine-2,4-Ldiaminobutyric amide di(trifluoroacetate) salt 10−5 M)
(Figure 2E).

Effect of physiological and pharmacological
relevant concentrations of 2-ME on the
inhibition of the 143B OS cell cycle
Previously, our research group demonstrated
that 2-ME-induced cell cycle arrest in 143B cells was
concentration-dependent [43]. Since physiological and
pharmacological relevant concentrations of 2-ME exerted
anticancer effects in previous experiments, current
studies were performed with the selected, representative
concentrations: physiological (10−8 M) and pharmacological
(10−7 M, 10−6 M) (Figure 1C). Cell cycle analysis was
conducted by imaging cytometry and cells were stained
with Hoechst 33342 and Cell TraceTM Calcein Red-Orange.
The number of 143B OS cells within the G2 and M phases
of the cell cycle increased with a 24 h treatment of every
2-ME concentration (Figure 1C). After 24 h incubation
with 10−8 M, 10−7 M, and 10−6 M of 2-ME, 22.16%, 30.15%
and 31.53% of the OS cells were in the G2 and M phases,
respectively as compared with the control (16.38%). Taken
together, 2-ME may also be considered as a physiological
oncostatic agent regulating cell proliferation and death.

Nitro-oxidative stress level after stimulation
with 2-ME
Previously, we demonstrated using flow cytometry
and 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2DA)
indicator that incubation of HT22 hippocampal and
143B OS cells with 10−6 M 2-ME resulted in an increase
in NO levels due to the upregulation of nNOS [21].
Herein, NO production was measured after treatment
of 143B cells with physiological and pharmacological
relevant concentrations of 2-ME. Imaging cytometry and
specific fluorescent indicators were used to determine
the NO level in live cells. 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,
7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM DA) was
chosen as the indicator because it is more sensitive to
NO, more photo-stable and less pH sensitive than DAF2DA [63, 64]. A significant increase in the level of NO
was observed in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3A).
After 2 h of incubation with 10−8 M, 10−7 M, and 10−6 M
of 2-ME, the level of NO was only slightly augmented
by 3.4%, 1%, 5.5% in comparison to the control,
respectively (Figure 3A). NO level significantly increased
by 24%, 27%, 39% after 6 h of treatment with 10−8 M,
10−7 M, 10−6 of 2-ME, respectively (Figure 3A, 3C).
Interestingly, after 8 h of incubation, an increase in
NO levels was detected only after treatment with 10−8
M and 10−7 M of 2-ME (Figure 3A, 3C). A 2-MEmediated increase in the level of NO was observed
without the presence of the nNOS inhibitor, L-NDBA. As
demonstrated in Figure 3B, level of NO was increased
by 10−6 M 2-ME and then significantly decreased after
preincubation with 10−5 M L-NDBA. Induction of nitrooxidative stress determined by 2′,7′-dichloro-fluorescein
diacetate (DCF-DA) fluorescence by 10−6 M 2-ME was
also reversed by using another specific nNOS inhibitor,
4-AAPNT (N-[(4S)-4-amino-5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]
pentyl]-N′-nitroguanidine tris(trifluoroacetate), 10−5 M)
(Figure 3D). These results confirmed the involvement of
nNOS in the anticancer mechanisms of action of 2-ME.
Increased expression of nNOS was correlated with
enhanced production of NO (Figure 2A, 2C).

Potential mechanisms of 143B OS cell death
induced by 2-ME
In our previous study, we demonstrated that 2-ME
under high pharmacological relevant concentrations
selectively increased nNOS level within 143B OS and
HT22 hippocampal cells, resulting in cell death [21].
The maximal nNOS expression peaked between 6 h
and 8 h of incubation. Moreover, specific inhibitor of
nNOS reversed cell death. E2 (10−6 M, 10−5 M) did not
significantly affect nNOS protein levels [21]. Thus,
this mode of action seems to be unique for 2-ME, since
E2 did not elicit any effects on nNOS concentrations
[21]. Similar effects were found at physiological
concentrations of 2-ME (Figure 2).
In the current study, nNOSα expression was
analyzed by Western blotting using specific anti-nNOS
antibodies (Figure 2D). nNOSα was reported as an
isoform that may be recruited to the nucleus [26, 27, 28].
As presented, total level of nNOSα increased after 1 h of
incubation with 10−9 M to 10−5 M of 2-ME (Figure 2D).
Precisely, nNOSα increased 2-fold after incubation with
10−7 M to 10−5 M of 2-ME. Incubation with 10−8 M and
10−9 M of 2-ME altered nNOSα expression 1.84 and 1.64
times, respectively. Immunofluorescence microscopy and
imaging cytometry was used to analyze the intracellular
localization of nNOS in 143B OS cells. Physiological
(10−8 M) and pharmacological (10−7 M, and 10−6 M)
concentrations of 2-ME were used. We observed that

2-ME-induced DNA damage

comet assay were used to evaluate DNA damage. The alkaline
assay detected single strand breaks (SSBs) and the neutral
assay detected double strand breaks (DSBs) [39]. Time- and
2-ME-concentration-dependent increases in both SSBs
and DSBs were observed (Figure 4). We present that 2-ME
increased DNA damage as soon as after 2 h of incubation
with the stimuli what is in the correlation with increased total
nNOS level (Figure 2). DSBs were 1.37, 1.37, and 1.92 times
greater in number after 2 h of incubation with 10−8 M, 10−7
M, and 10−6 M of 2-ME in comparison to the control (0.82),
respectively (Figure 4A). Incubation with 10−8 M, 10−7 M,
and 10−6 M of 2-ME for 2 h resulted in 5.30-, 7.72-, and 11.45fold increases in the SSBs in comparison to the control (1.86),

We were wondering whether 2-ME increased nNOS
levels and nitro-oxidative stress generation within the
nuclei of 143B OS cells may exert any effects on DNA
damage and genomic instability In a previous study, the
nNOS inhibitor, L-NDBA, significantly decreased the DNA
fragmentation rate after 16 h of incubation with 10−6 M of
2-ME [21 and Figure 5B]. Due to the fact that we observed
nNOS induction after 1 h maintaining till 8 h of incubation
with both physiological and pharmacological concentrations
of 2-ME (Figure 2C), we assessed DNA strand breaks after
2 h and 8 h of incubation with 2-ME. Two versions of the

respectively (Figure 4B, 4C). The number of DSBs and SSBs
subsequently increased after 8 h of incubation with 2-ME. In
comparison to the control (1.31), 3.23-, 4.66-, and 3.25-fold
increases were observed in DSBs after 143B OS cells were
incubated with 10−8 M, 10−7 M, and 10−6 M of 2-ME for 8
h, respectively (Figure 4A, 4C). SSBs increased by a factor
of 7.02, 5.14, and 12.85 after 8 h of incubation with 10−8 M,
10−7 M, and 10−6 M of 2-ME in comparison to the control
(4.18), respectively (Figure 4B, 4C). Appearance of SSBs and
DSBs after 2 h of incubation with 2-ME seemed to be one
of the first signals of DNA damage. The cytokinesis-block
micronucleus (CBMN) assay confirmed that 2-ME stimulated
genotoxicity in 143B OS cells. Micronuclei formation is
correlated with altered genomic stability. Genomic instability
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is often associated with cancer and may be indicative of a poor
prognosis for some types of cancer [74, 75, 76, 77]. By imaging
cytometry the influence of 2-ME on micronucleus formation
was examined. Our experimental data suggested that a time
period of 24 h was sufficient for the effective cell division and
micronucleus formation of 143B OS cells. 24 h treatment with
physiological and pharmacological relevant concentrations of
2-ME lead to increased genomic instability within the 143B
cells. This confirmed the genotoxic effects of 2-ME within
the experimental model. Incubation with 2-ME resulted in
an increased amount of micronuclei that was concentrationdependent. After 24 h of incubation with 10−8 M, 10−7 M, and
10−6 M of 2-ME, micronucleus formation increased by 23.4%
± 1.5, 25.3% ± 1.4, and 28% ± 1.1 in comparison to the control

(20.35% ± 1), respectively (Figure 5A, 5B). Activation of the
DNA damage response (DDR) is an important determinant of
cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs eliminating tumor
cells. 53BP1 is a protein recognizing the central DNA-binding
domain of p53. It relocates to the sites of DNA strand breaks
in response to DNA damage [39]. We investigated whether
the DNA damage response was activated after the treatment
of OS cells with 2-ME at physiological and pharmacological
concentrations. DNA damage detected as 53BP1 foci/nucleus
was evaluated by means of imaging cytometry. As demonstrated
in Figure 5, recruitment of 53BP1 was significantly increased
after 2 h of treatment at all concentrations of 2-ME (Figure 5C,
5D). The recorded data fully supported the observed SSBs and
DSBs in 143B OS cells after treatment with 2-ME (Figure 4).
The cells in which DDR was activated may be those that did
not undergo cell death, another will be transferred to the way
of cell death [78].

Various preclinical and clinical cancer models
proved the anticancer properties of 2-ME [13, 14, 15,
48, 49, 50, 51, 52], though there are only few reports
concerning the physiological activity of 2-ME [5, 6,
53]. Similarly to our current results, Vijayanathan and
co-workers demonstrated the inhibitory effects of 10−8
M of 2-ME towards MCF-7 cell growth [5]. Decreased
concentrations of 2-ME have been implicated as one of
the reasons for pre-eclampsia, suggesting that 2-ME
plays an important physiological role [6]. For the first
time, we managed to prove that at physiological 2-ME
concentrations (10−10 M – 10−8 M) induced apoptosis
in highly metastatic 143B OS cells. While high
pharmacological relevant 2-ME concentrations (10−6 M –
10−5 M) induced necrosis. Little information is available
concerning the induction of necrosis within cancer cells
by 2-ME. High pharmacological concentrations of 2-ME
induced necrosis within human endometrial carcinoma
cells (RL-95–2) [44]. Up to date, 2-ME was shown to
inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis or cell death in
cancer cells [19, 21, 33, 35, 45, 54–56].
Previously, we demonstrated that high pharma­
cological concentrations of 2-ME lead to OS and
hippocampal cell death through the induction of nNOS
[21]. In the current study, we hypothesize that, under
physiological and therapeutical conditions, 2-ME stimulates
the nuclear hijacking of nNOS and directly induced nitrooxidative stress within the nucleus. 2-ME seems to be strictly

DISCUSSION
Herein, we demonstrated a new mode of anticancer
action of 2-ME at physiological and pharmacologically
relevant concentrations. Increased levels of nNOS within
the nuclei of 143B OS cells and the subsequent induction
of nitro-oxidative stress caused cell cycle arrest and
cancer cell death. We used the OS experimental model
due to its high malignancy, chemoresistance and genomic
instability [101].

[82, 83, 84]. In vitro studies with cellular models indicated
that NO and its derivatives were able to induce direct- and
mediated-genotoxic effects [85, 86]. Bossy-Wetzel and
Lipton reported that excessive amounts of NO may have
induced S-nitrosylation and/or triggered DNA damage,
resulting in cell death [87]. ROS/RNS action on DNA
may have caused several modifications of nucleotides and
generated SSBs and DSBs [82, 84, 88]. Oxidative stress
preferentially induced micronucleus formation and mediated
the genomic instability caused by p53 dysfunction [89].
Diverse chemotherapeutics like 2-ME may be selectively
toxic to tumor cells by increasing oxidative/nitro-oxidative
stress and pushing the already-stressed cancer cells beyond
their limit [90, 91]. DNA damage caused by increased
nNOS levels within OS cell nuclei led to cancer cell death
at physiological and pharmacological concentrations of
2-ME. Consistent with our study, 2-ME was reported to
enhance the sensitivity of glioma cell lines to radiotherapy
by arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and increased
DNA damage [92]. Khoei and colleagues demonstrated that
combined treatment with 25 × 10−5 M of 2-ME and 60Co
significantly increased iododeoxyuridine DNA damage.
Only slight DNA damage was observed when 2-ME was

associated with pro-apoptotic and oncostatic mechanisms of
action. nNOS has been believed to be a cytosolic isoform
[57, 58]. However, different splicing variants and subcellular
localizations of the enzyme were recently reported [26].
Nonetheless, the exact role of nNOS within the nucleus has
continued to remain undefined [26, 27, 59]. The effect of
2-ME on proteins regulating nNOS translocation from the
cytosol to the nucleus is currently under our investigation.
In contrast to eNOS or iNOS, nNOS is a larger protein
containing a PDZ domain at its N-terminal, a consensus
sequence of approximately 90 amino acids [60–62].
The PDZ domain seems to be an important factor for the
facilitation of nNOS to distinct intercellular compartments
[27, 59]. Aquilano and colleagues demonstrated that PDZ is
essential for the nuclear recruitment of nNOS, thus favoring
NO production [26]. 2-ME-increased nitro-oxidative stress
associated with the generation of NO and/or its derivatives
within the nuclei of OS cells may have directly resulted in
SSBs and DSBs, leading to 143B OS cell death. The link
between nuclear proteotoxic stress and cancer cell death
has been recently reported [79, 80, 81]. Local generation
of NO and/or their reactive derivatives (nitrogen dioxide,
peroxynitrite) are likely contributed to DNA damage

administered separately [93]. This result may be attributable
to the U87MG glioblastoma cancer cell line spheroid model.
Higher resistance has been observed within spheroid cultures
in comparison to monolayer cultures [93, 94]. Moreover,
cancer cell chemosensitization by NO during anticancer
therapy has been reported [95]. Treatments of human cancer
cells with NO and NO mimetics also have been shown to
restore chemoresistance both in vivo and in vitro [96, 97,
98, 99]. On the other hand, malfunction of DNA damage
repair system may result in chemoresistance of cancer cells
and further cancer progression [75, 78, 100]. It may be
considered as one of the limitations of long-term 2-ME use.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that SSBs and DSBs
is involved in the 2-ME oncostatic mechanism (Figure 6).
Anticancer effects were observed at physiological and
pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Mechanisms
of nuclear transport of nNOS induced by 2-ME need to be
further investigated.

Cell line and culture conditions
143B OS cell line was obtained from the American
Tissue Type Collection (ATTC-8303). Cells were cultured
at 37oC in a humidified atmosphere and saturated with
5% CO2. Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium was
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
and a penicillin (100 μg/mL)/streptomycin (100 μg/mL)
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, Poland).

Cell treatment
The 143B OS cells were treated with various
concentrations of 2-ME and time, depending on the design
of experiments. 10−5 M of nNOS inhibitor (4-AAPNT,
L-NDBA) was added to the cells after 2 h of pre-treatment.

The medium was removed and the cells were washed with
a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma Aldrich). A new
medium containing 2-ME replaced the previous one. We used
charcoal-stripped FBS (Sigma Aldrich, Poland) in the medium
for cell treatment. Charcoal-stripped FBS is used to elucidate
the effects of hormones in a variety of in vitro systems.

The pellet was next washed twice with PBS, followed by
resuspension in PBS. The whole procedure was performed
on ice. Afterward, 3 × 104 cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry (BD FACScan) and the results were analyzed
by Cyflogic software, version 1.2.1. Each experiment was
performed at least three times.

Reagents

NO level by imaging cytometry

Tissue culture media, antibiotic cocktail, fetal bovine
sera, 2-ME, the nNOS inhibitors L-NDBA, 4-AAPNT
were purchased form Sigma Aldrich Poland. Anti-rabbit
IgG were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK).
Mouse antibodies against nNOS, secondary polyclonal
rat antibody against mouse IgG were obtained from BD
Biosciences (Germany).

Imaging of RNS production in living cells based
on fluorescent indicators has been reported as a fast,
sensitive and selective method [40, 41]. After 2-, 6-, 8-h
treatments with 2-ME, NO levels were evaluated using the
fluorogenic probe DAF-FM DA (5 × 10−6 M) and a 10-min
incubation time in a PBS buffer. NO-specific fluorescent
signals were captured with an In Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE
Healthcare, UK) equipped with a high performance CCD
camera. For NO positive control, a NO donor – MAHMA
NONOate (10−3 M) was used.

Assessment of apoptosis by flow cytometry with
Annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) staining
The analysis was performed as previously described
[21, 36]. 143B OS cells were seeded onto six-well plates at
a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h of culturing in the
standard medium, the cells were treated with 2-ME for 24 h.
The cells were then pelleted and incubated with Annexin
V and PI according to manufacturer’s protocol (BD
Pharmingen, Poland). Afterwards, the cells (3 × 104/sample)
were analyzed and the fluorescent signals of Annexin V
conjugate and PI were detected at the fluorescence intensity
channels FL1 and FL3 (BD FACScan). The results were
then analyzed by Cyflogic software, version 1.2.1. Each
experiment was performed at least three times.

Immunofluorescence microscopy
The immunofluorescence was performed as
previously described [50, 21]. The 143B OS cells were
treated with 2-ME for 8 h. Anti-nNOS (1:50 in 0.3%
GSA, 2 h incubation, BD Biosciences) and goat antimouse secondary-conjugated with CY3 (1:100, GAM
Cy3, 1 h incubation, Jackson Immunoresearch, Suffolk,
UK) antibodies were used. The images were analysed
and merged employing the ImageJ software 1.44p. Each
experiment was performed at least three times.

nNOS immunostaining by imaging cytometry

Cell cycle analysis

For nNOS immunostaining, interphase nuclei
were used. After 2-, 6-, and 8-h treatments with 2-ME in
the 96-well plate, 143B OS cells were fixed with 3.7%
formaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS
for 20 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with
1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST (phosphate
buffered saline containing 0.25% Triton X-100) at room
temperature for 30 min. After washing with PBST, the
cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies
against nNOS (BD Biosciences, Germany) (diluted 1:50
in PBST–BSA [PBST containing 1% BSA]) overnight at
4oC. The next day, FITC-conjugated, secondary polyclonal
rat antibodies against mouse IgG (BD Biosciences,
Germany) (diluted 1:1000 in PBST–BSA) were added
and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Nuclei were
visualized with Hoechst 33342. Digital cell images were
captured with an In Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE Healthcare,
UK) equipped with a high performance CCD camera. To
analyze cellular nNOS content and localization, In Cell
Analyzer software (In Cell Analyzer Investigator) was
used. The fluorescence density was presented in relative
fluorescence units (RFUs). As a positive control, treatment
with 0.1 mg/ml nocodazole was used.

After treatment with 2-ME, 143B OS cells were
stained with a mixture of Hoechst 33342 (2.5 μg/ml) and
Cell TraceTM Calcein Red-Orange AM (2.5 × 10−6 M) (Life
Technologies, Poland) in a serum-free DMEM medium
at 37oC for 30 min. The OS cells were rinsed with PBS
and subjected to cell cycle analysis using an In Cell
Analyzer 2000 (GE Healthcare, UK) equipped with a high
performance CCD camera.

Assessment of nitro-oxidative stress by flow
cytometry
ROS and RNS production were determined using
flow cytometry with DCF-DA staining. The cells were
seeded onto six-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/
well. After 24 h of culturing in the normal growth medium,
cells were exposed to treatment with 2-ME for 24 hours.
Subsequently, 30 min before the end of the incubation
time, a solution of DCF-DA was added to each well of
treated cells in order to obtain the final concentration of
10−5 M for 2-ME. Next, both floating and trypsinized cells
were collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 7 min.

53BP1 immunostaining

Kit and following the standard protocol outlined in the
manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 500 binucleated
cells per well [37, 38] were scored using an In Cell
Analyzer 2000 (GE Healthcare, UK) equipped with a high
performance CCD camera. For a positive control, 24 h
treatment with 100 ng/ml mitomycin C was used.

The analysis was performed as previously described
[39]. For 53BP1 immunostaining, interphase nuclei were
used. After 2-, 8- and 24-h treatments with 2-ME in
the 96-well plate, 143B OS cells were fixed with 3.7%
formaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20
min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) in PBST (phosphate buffered saline
containing 0.25% Triton X-100) at room temperature for
30 min. After washing with PBST, the cells were incubated
with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against 53BP1 (Novus
Biologicals, Poland) (diluted 1:200 in PBST–BSA (PBST
containing 1% BSA)) overnight at 4°C. The next day, FITCconjugated secondary polyclonal antibodies against rabbit
IgG (BD Biosciences, Germany) (diluted 1:200 in PBST–
BSA) were added and incubated at room temperature for
1 h. Nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33342. Digital cell
images were captured with an In Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE
Healthcare, UK) equipped with a high performance CCD
camera. 53BP1 foci were scored per nucleus.

Western blotting
The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated
using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif, France)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Equal amounts of
total cell lysates were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE. The
membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies
anti-nNOS (BD Biosciences) (1:1000) overnight at 4°C and
an analysis was performed as previously described [21, 36].
The chemiluminescence was detected using ImageQuant
LAS 500 (GE Healthcare). The protein level was
quantified by densitometry technique using the Quantity
one 4.5.2 software. The protein levels, as determined by
chemiluminescent signal quantification, were normalized
relative to beta-actin levels found in the samples. Each
experiment was performed at least three times.

Comet assay
The analysis was performed as previously described
[39]. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and DNA singlestrand breaks (SSBs) were assessed with neutral and
alkaline single-cell microgel electrophoresis (comet assay),
respectively. After 2- and 8-h treatments with 2-ME, 143B
OS cells were suspended in PBS and mixed with low melting
(LM) agarose (0.7%). The cells were fixed to agarose (LM)
slides and lyzed with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) and reduced
glutathione (2 mg/ml) in a lysis solution (1.25 M NaCl, 50
mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris–HCl, 0.01% N-lauroylsarcosine
sodium salt, pH 10) at 37oC for 2 h. Electrophoresis (neutral
comet assay buffer: 100 mM Tris–HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.2% DMSO, pH 10 and alkaline comet assay buffer:
1 mM EDTA, 0.2% DMSO, 300 mM NaOH, pH > 12) was
performed on the treated cells. The slides were then stained
with 2.5 × 107 M YOYO-1 (Invitrogen Corporation, Grand
Island, NY, USA) in a 2.5% DMSO and 0.5% sucrose solution.
The cells were mounted with a coverslip and digital comet
images were immediately captured with an Olympus BX61
fluorescence microscope equipped with a DP72 CCD camera
and Olympus CellF software. The CCD capture conditions
were: exposure time 81 ms, magnification 400x. Images
were saved as TIFF files. At least 100 comets were measured
per each sample triplicate using AutoComet Software http://
autocomet.com/index.php (TriTek Corp). The Tail Moment
(Tail moment=tail length x fraction of total DNA in the tail)
was scored as general parameter to DNA integrity assessment.
