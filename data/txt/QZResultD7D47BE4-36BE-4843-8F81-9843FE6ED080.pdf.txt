Abstract
Tumor-inﬁltrating immune cells can promote chemoresistance and metastatic spread in aggressive tumors.
Consequently, the type and quality of immune responses present in the neoplastic stroma are highly predictive of
patient outcome in several cancer types. In addition to host immune responses, intrinsic tumor cell activities that
mimic stem cell properties have been linked to chemoresistance, metastatic dissemination, and the induction of
immune suppression. Cancer stem cells are far from a static cell population; rather, their presence seems to be
controlled by highly dynamic processes that are dependent on cues from the tumor stroma. However, the impact
immune responses have on tumor stem cell differentiation or expansion is not well understood. In this study, we
show that targeting tumor-inﬁltrating macrophages (TAM) and inﬂammatory monocytes by inhibiting either the
myeloid cell receptors colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) or chemokine (C–C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2)
decreases the number of tumor-initiating cells (TIC) in pancreatic tumors. Targeting CCR2 or CSF1R improves
chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy, inhibits metastasis, and increases antitumor T-cell responses. Tumor-educated
macrophages also directly enhanced the tumor-initiating capacity of pancreatic tumor cells by activating the
transcription factor STAT3, thereby facilitating macrophage-mediated suppression of CD8þ T lymphocytes.
Together, our ﬁndings show how targeting TAMs can effectively overcome therapeutic resistance mediated by
TICs. Cancer Res; 73(3); 1128–41. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor-inﬁltrating immune cells are a hallmark of most solid
tumors, and the presence of varied immune populations signiﬁcantly affects clinical outcomes for patients with cancer (1,
2). Historically, tumor-inﬁltrating immune cells have been
viewed as restraining tumor progression (3), but in recent years,
it has become more widely appreciated that chronic immune
responses play critical roles in promoting tumor progression,

metastasis, and resistance to cytotoxic therapies (1). Therefore,
understanding the molecular mechanisms by which malignant
cells derail antitumor immune responses to favor disease
progression is critical to identify potential therapeutic targets.
Recently, we reported that selective depletion of tumor-inﬁltrating macrophages (TAM) by neutralizing colony-stimulating
factor-1 (CSF1) or inhibiting CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) activity
improves the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy in mammary tumors, in
part by instigating antitumor responses by CD8þ T cells (4).
Similarly, deﬁciency in the CSF1 gene in op/op mice leads to
decreased mammary tumor metastasis and slows pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumor development (5, 6). Although the potent
capacity of macrophages to induce tumor progression has been
well established, the mechanisms by which macrophage affect
chemoresistance are not well deﬁned.
In addition to immune regulation of cancer progression and
chemoresistance, tumor cells that acquire stem-like or tumorinitiating properties (often called "cancer stem cells") exhibit
enhanced resistance to cytotoxic therapy and increased
propensity for metastatic dissemination (7, 8). Several lines
of evidence suggest that the tumor-initiating capacity of
malignant cells is rooted in inﬂammatory signals (9). However, the mechanisms by which different populations of
leukocytes might support the expansion of tumor-initiating
cells (TIC) are unknown. One possibility is that reciprocal

Macrophages Regulate Tumor-Initiating Cells

cross-talk between tumor-inﬁltrating leukocytes and malignant cells regulates the development of cells with stem-like
properties, which in turn facilitates resistance to therapeutic
interventions. A recent study showed that macrophages
can induce tumor stem-like properties in vitro in murine
lung and colon cancer cell lines (10). However, it is
unclear whether this interaction can be exploited pharmacologically, and if so, whether it also affects tumor-derived
immunosuppression.
In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which
macrophages and TICs collaborate to regulate pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression, immunosuppression, and responses to chemotherapy. We show that

targeting TAMs by inhibiting either CSF1R or chemokine (C–
C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) decreases the numbers of pancreatic TICs and improves chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy in vivo.
We also found that TAMs directly induce TIC properties in
pancreatic cancer cells by activating STAT3. In turn, TICs
induce immunosuppressive behavior in TAMs, and thus
block antitumor CD8þ T-lymphocyte responses during chemotherapeutic treatment.

Macrophages Regulate Tumor-Initiating Cells

diagnosed at the Department of Pathology at Washington
University (St Louis, MO). Patients had not received neoadjuvant therapy and underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, typically followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. To assemble TMAs,
clearly deﬁned areas of tumor tissue were demarked and 2
biopsies (1.0-mm diameter) taken from each donor block. We
used 4.0-mm parafﬁn sections for immunohistochemical (IHC)
analyses. The Washington University School of Medicine (St
Louis, MO) ethical committee approved this study. Fully
automated image acquisition was used using Aperio ScanScope XT Slide Scanner (Aperio Technologies) system to
capture whole-slide digital images with a 20 objective. A
tumor-speciﬁc nuclear algorithm (IHC-MARK) developed inhouse was modiﬁed to quantify CD8 and CD68 expression as
previously published (4, 11).

at day 21 (21) or gross palpation of the pancreas. Gemcitabine
(GEM; Hospira) was obtained from the Washington University
School of Medicine pharmacy and diluted in PBS. Mice were
treated with 50 mg/kg gemcitabine by intravenous injection into
the right retro-orbital sinus every 4 to 5 days. Preclinical studies
were conducted with 10 to 15 age-matched 10-week-old female
mice/group. In survival studies, a death event was classiﬁed as a
loss of 15% of body weight or poor body conditioning score.
Disease and tumor burden were measured by the gross wet
weight of the pancreas. Metastatic and disseminated tumors
were scored by gross evaluation, which was validated by either
bioluminescence or tissue pathology.
Additional methodologic detail is in the Supplementary
Data.

CCR2 kinase, CSF1R kinase, and STAT3 inhibitors
CCR2 inhibitor PF-04136309 was provided by Pﬁzer and
administered to mice at a concentration of 100 mg/kg in twicedaily subcutaneous injections. PF-04136309 details have been
previously published (12). Inhibitors of CSF1R1 and CSF1R2
were provided by Plexxikon Inc. CSF1Ri1 is PLX6134 that
contains the GW2580 compound, which was described in
detail elsewhere (13). CSF1Ri2 is PLX3397, a selective biospeciﬁc inhibitor for c-Fms and the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinases,
with biochemical IC50 values of 0.02 and 0.01 mmol/L, respectively. PLX3397 was used as a conﬁrmatory compound for
PLX6134/GW2580 with better speciﬁcity for CSF1R, and details
were presented elsewhere (4, 14, 15). Both CSF1R inhibitors
were administered to mice in a formulated diet at a concentration of 800 mg/kg chow. STATIC was obtained from
Calbiochem/EMD, used at doses less than the reported IC50
(<10 mmol/L) in vitro, and handled according to manufacturer
instructions.

ALDH PDAC cells have high tumor-initiating capacity
To investigate how macrophages impact the presence of
TICs, we used 3 distinct murine pancreatic tumor cell lines,
denoted as Kras-INK, KCM, and PAN02, derived from
PDACs arising from genetic models (p48-CRE/LSL-Kras/
INK4Aﬂox/wt or Pdx-CRE/LSL-Kras/Tg-Muc1) or tumors arising from 3-methylcholanthrene carcinogenesis (PAN02;
refs. 16, 17, 22). To identify potential TIC cellular subsets, these
cell lines were labeled with mCherry and Click-beetle Red
(CBR) luciferase and analyzed for EpCAM, CD24, CD44,
CD29, CD49f, CD133, and cMet expression and Aldeﬂuor
activity (a measure of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity)
using mCherry to identify implanted tumor cells in vivo.
Our analysis revealed a distinct population of tumor cells
with high Aldeﬂuor activity (ALDHBright; Fig. 1A). No distinct
populations of CD133þ or cMetþ cells were observed. Analysis of cell sorted from orthotopic Kras-INK and KCM PDAC
tumors illustrated that ALDHBright cells express higher levels
of CD29, CD44, and CD49f, display increased tumor spheroid
formation in vitro, and have increased tumorigenic potential
in nude mice (Fig. 1A–C, data not shown). Analysis of fresh
human PDAC tissue also revealed an identiﬁable population
of ALDHBright tumor cells with a frequency ranging from 2%
to 15% of the total CD45 EpCAMþ cells (Fig. 1E). IHC
analysis of ALDH1A1 revealed a signiﬁcant increase in
positive cells in PDAC tissue compared with the normal
pancreas (Fig. 1D). These results are consistent with previous reports showing the tumorigenic potential of ALDH1þ
cells in human tumors (23, 24).

Cell lines and constructs
PAN02 cells were obtained from Dr. David C. Linehan
(Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO),
KCM cells from Dr. Pinku Mukherjee (University of North
Carolina, Charlotte, NC), and Kras-INK from Dr. Douglas
Hanahan's laboratory (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) and have been published elsewhere (16–18). Brieﬂy, KCM and Kras-INK were derived from
pancreatic adenocarcinomas from p48-CRE/LSL-KrasG12D/
Muc1.Tg (17, 18) and p48-CRE/LSL-KrasG12D/INK4aﬂox (18,
19) mice, respectively. All cell lines were Mycoplasma tested
and labeled with a polycistronic click beetle red luciferasemCherry reporter by lentiviral infection, and positive cells were
selected by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorting.
These constructs were supplied by Dr. David Piwnica-Worms
and the BRIGHT Institute (St Louis, MO).
Orthotopic model and preclinical animal cohorts
Syngeneic orthotopic PDAC tumors were established by
surgical implantation as previously described (20). Brieﬂy, we
injected 50,000 to 200,000 cells with 50 mL Matrigel (BD-Biosciences) and cohorts of mice were randomized to treatment
groups by bioluminescence imaging of click beetle red luciferase

Results

Depletion of TAMs decreased the presence of ALDHBright
TICs
To determine whether targeting TAMs alters the frequency of
TICs, we treated mice bearing orthotopic KCM tumors with 2
CSF1R tyrosine kinase antagonists and a CCR2 antagonist
and used CCR2 knockout mice (CCR2/). The CSF1R kinase
inhibitors used were PLX6134, a preparation of the GW2580
compound (CSF1Ri1), and PLX3397 (CSF1Ri2). To test CCR2
antagonism, we used PF04136309 (CCR2i). Additional details
and structures for these compounds are in the Materials and
Methods and published elsewhere (12–15, 25). Analysis of tumor
tissue after 21 days of treatment revealed signiﬁcant reductions

(presumably lymphoid-derived dendritic cells), and the numbers
of CD11bþLy6GHiLy6Cþ immature granulocytes/neutrophils
were modestly increased (30%; Fig. 2A). Despite possible
cellular diversity, we will use the terms granulocytic myeloidderived suppressor cells (G-MDSC) for CD11bþLy6GHiLy6Cþ
cells and monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSC) for CD11bþ
Ly6GLy6CHiF4/80MidMHCIIþ cells.
Analysis of the impact of CCR2 or CSF1R inhibition on TAM
subsets found that these inhibitors signiﬁcantly deplete
macrophages expressing high levels of MHCII, but not
MHCIILo or Tie2þ TAMs (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig.
S1A). Analysis of the MHCIIHi macrophages showed that these
cells express the highest levels of F4/80, display high tumor
phagocytosis as measured by mCherry ﬂuorescence, and
express modest levels of extracellular MRC1 (features consistent with mature macrophages).
To determine whether CSF1R and CCR2 blockade have
differential effects on tumor-inﬁltrating myeloid cells, we
analyzed the impact of CSF1R and CCR2 inhibitors as single
agents or in combination (Fig. 2C). Mice bearing established
(1 cm) PDAC tumors were treated for 4 or 8 days with CCR2i,
anti-CSF1 immunoglobulin G (IgG; 5A1), CSF1Ri2, or CCR2i
plus CSF1Ri2. Analysis of tumor-inﬁltrating M-MDSCs and
TAMs revealed no additive effects of combined inhibition.
Individually, anti-CSF1, CSF1Ri, and CCR2i all effectively
depleted monocytes within 4 days. However, blockade of
CSF1/CSF1R depleted mature TAMs in the ﬁrst 4 days, whereas
CCR2 inhibition did not effectively deplete TAMs until after 8
days of treatment. These results suggest that CSF1R and CCR2
have redundant rather than divergent activities on depleting
TAMs and M-MDSCs.
To assess the effects of these inhibitors on TICs, we
conducted a parallel analysis of the KCM tumor cells,
identiﬁed by CD45mCherryþ, and found a 40% to 55%
reduction in CD44HiALDHBright TICs following CCR2 or
CSF1R blockade (Fig. 2A(i)). To determine whether macrophage depletion can rapidly alter the presence of ALDHBright
TICs, we treated mice bearing approximately 1-cm Kras-INK
tumors with CSF1R inhibitors for 8 days and found a 40% to
70% decrease in CD44HiALDHBright TICs (Fig. 2C). We
observed similar results in orthotopic PAN02 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Correlating with these observed
decreases in ALDHBright cells, we found that OCT4, Nanog,
and SOX2 mRNA expression was decreased following treatment with CSF1R or CCR2 inhibitors (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S1C). Notably, IHC and mRNA analysis of CCR2
or CSF1R expression in these PDAC tumors revealed they do
not express signiﬁcant levels of CCR2 or CSF1R in vivo and in
vitro (Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E). Taken together,
these results suggest that targeting TAMs can rapidly reduce
the numbers of ALDHBright TICs.

TAMs can directly enhance the tumor-initiating
properties of PDAC cells
To determine whether macrophages can directly enhance
the tumor-initiating properties of pancreatic cancer cells, we
cocultured macrophages with PDAC cells. Coculture with
macrophages increased the frequency of ALDHBright cells in
murine and human PDAC cell lines (Fig. 3A). To determine
whether soluble factors derived from tumor-educated macrophages enhanced TIC properties, we ﬁrst cultured bone-marrow–derived macrophages (BM-MAC) in PDAC-conditioned
medium (CM) and then used the resultant "tumor-educated"
BM-MACs to create conditioned medium for tumor spheroid
assays. Conditioned medium from tumor-activated BM-MACs
enhanced the formation of tumor spheres in PAN02, Kras-INK,
and KCM cells (Fig. 3B). Similar results were also seen in KrasINK cells cultured in Transwells with BM-MACs (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Consistent with enhanced tumor-initiating
properties, we observed that BM-MAC coculture increased
CD29 and CD49f protein and OCT4, Nanog, and SOX2 mRNA
expression in PDAC cells (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Another feature commonly associated with TICs is
increased resistance to chemotherapy. Fitting this,
ALDHBright cells isolated from Kras-INK tumors displayed
decreased response to gemcitabine (Supplementary Fig.
S2C). To elucidate whether macrophages can enhance the
resistance to chemotherapy, we treated PDAC cells with
gemcitabine and found reduced numbers of Annexin Vþ cells
when BM-MACs were present in coculture (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S2D). Similar results were observed using a
Transwell system or BM-MAC-CM (Supplementary Fig. S2E
and S2F). Together, these results suggest that tumor-educated
macrophages produce soluble factors that can regulate both
tumor-initiating capacity and chemoresistance in PDAC cells.
Gemcitabine treatment increases macrophage
inﬁltration into PDAC tumors
Common chemotherapeutics have been reported to induce
the recruitment of myeloid cells to regressing tumors (4, 26, 27).
To assess whether gemcitabine treatment alters myeloid cell
recruitment in PDAC tumors, we analyzed pancreatic tissue
from normal mice or mice bearing Kras-INK tumors  GEM
treatment. The numbers of TAMs, G-MDSCs, inﬂammatory
monocytes, and CD4þFOXP3þ regulatory T cells (Treg) were
increased by the presence of PDAC tumors, but only TAMs
increased in number following gemcitabine treatment (Fig.
3E). Corresponding with increased TAM inﬁltration, CSF1 and
CCL2 but not CCL5 were upregulated by gemcitabine treatment (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these results suggest that
blockade of CCR2 and/or CSF1R would improve the response
to gemcitabine in PDAC tumors.
Targeting TAMs enhances the response to chemotherapy
and reduces metastasis
CSF1R and CCR2 inhibitors as single agents modestly
slow PDAC tumor growth, similar to gemcitabine therapy
(Figs. 4A–C and Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C). Similar results
were also observed in CCR2/ mice (Supplementary Fig. S3B),
suggesting that these effects are due to alterations in the tumor

improve responses to chemotherapy, we treated mice bearing
established orthotopic Kras-INK or Pan02 tumors with gemcitabine alone or in combination with CSF1R or CCR2 inhibitors. We found that CSF1Ri plus gemcitabine dramatically
slowed tumor progression in both Pan02 and Kras-INK orthotopic tumors (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3C).

For example, in Kras-INK tumors, gemcitabine reduced tumor
growth (compared with parallel mice sacriﬁced at the start of

the survival of Pan02 tumor-bearing mice (Supplementary
Fig. S3D).
Paralleling the observed efﬁcacy of CSF1Ri plus gemcitabine,
although gemcitabine treatment signiﬁcantly increased the
frequency of both TAMs and ALDHBright TICs, this increase was
abrogated by CSF1R inhibition (Fig. 4G and H). Similar but less
dramatic effects were observed with CCR2 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3E). Taken together, these results suggest that
blocking macrophage inﬁltration into tumors during therapy
reduces the number of TICs and improves the efﬁcacy of
chemotherapy.
Depletion of TAMs results in increased CTL response
during chemotherapy
Previous studies showed that TAMs have signiﬁcant immunosuppressive capacity (4, 28, 29). To determine whether
macrophage depletion would restore antitumor T-cell activity
in PDAC tumors, we analyzed tumor-inﬁltrating T lymphocytes in mice treated with CCR2i or CSF1Ri  GEM. Analysis
of tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes revealed signiﬁcantly
increased CD4þ and CD8þ T cell and reduced FOXP3þ Treg
inﬁltration when CSF1Ri or CCR2i was given in combination
with gemcitabine (Fig. 5A–C). Thus, despite eliciting decreased
tumor growth, single-agent gemcitabine, CCR2i, or CFS1Ri did
not alter T-cell inﬁltration, suggesting that both tumor cell
destruction by chemotherapy and macrophage depletion are
necessary to sustain CTL inﬁltration. Consistent with elevated
CTL responses, we also observed increased IFN-g, IFN-b1,
granzyme B, perforin, and interleukin (IL)-12 p35 and
decreased TGF-b and arginase-1 mRNA expression in tumors
(Fig. 5D). To determine the role of CD8þ T lymphocytes in the
efﬁcacy of combined therapy, we used CD8-depleting antibodies (clone 2.43) in the context of CSF1Ri plus gemcitabine
treatment. While treatment with CSF1Ri1 plus GEM signiﬁcantly blunted tumor growth compared with the effects of
gemcitabine alone (80%), this therapeutic efﬁcacy was largely
dependent on CD8þ T lymphocytes (Fig. 5E).
TAMs and TICs cross-talk to repress CD8 T lymphocytes
Immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment can be
mediated by TAMs, M-MDSCs, G-MDSCs, Tregs, and immature
dendritic cells. Although TAMs are the most prevalent of these
cells, 2 recent reports showed that G-MDSCs mobilized by
tumor-derived granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) can also suppress CTL activation in PDAC
tumors (30, 31). To assess the immunosuppressive capacity of
these leukocytes, we isolated tumor-inﬁltrating TAMs and GMDSCs from Kras-INK tumors and compared their ability with
suppress CD8þ T lymphocyte proliferation (by Carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution) following polyclonal
anti-CD3/CD28 activation. Although both TAMs and G-MDSCs
are capable of suppressing CD8þ T-cell proliferation, TAMs
were slightly more suppressive at lower dilutions (Fig. 5F).
Enhanced T-cell–suppressive activity in TICs has been
reported in glioblastoma (32). To test if PDAC TICs are highly
immunosuppressive, we analyzed the suppressive capacity of
ALDHBright and ALDHDim KCM cells and found that although
both subsets inhibit CD8þ T-cell proliferation at high concen-

www.aacrjournals.org

trations, ALDHBright cells exhibited modestly greater suppressive activity (Fig. 5G).
Activation of the immunosuppressive properties in innate
immune cells by tumor cells is a common feature of aggressive
tumors. To determine whether PDAC TICs increase the immunosuppressive capacity of macrophages, we cocultured small
numbers of ALDHBright and ALDHDim KCM cells with BM-MACs
(Fig. 5H). Although tumor-na€ve BM-MACs exhibited decreased
CD8-suppressive capacity compared with that of TAMs, CD8
suppression by BM-MACs was signiﬁcantly elevated by the
presence of ALDHBright but not ALDHDim KCM cells. Taken
together, these data suggest that inhibiting CSF1R or CCR2 in the
context of chemotherapy allows productive CD8þ T-cell
responses via the combined action of the (i) reduced presence
of immunosuppressive ALDHBright TICs, (ii) reduced presence of
immunosuppressive TAMs (as well as M-MDSC), and (iii) disruption of TIC-induced macrophage immunosuppression.
STAT3 activation is necessary for macrophagedependent increases in TIC numbers and
chemoresistance
STAT3 is a key mediator of proinﬂammatory cytokines
and immune suppression in both leukocytes and neoplastic
cells, and has also been linked to TIC survival and chemoresistance in several cancer types (33–36). IHC analysis of
tumor tissue from mice treated with CSF1R or CCR2 inhibitors revealed signiﬁcantly reduced levels of phosphoSTAT3 (pSTAT3, Ser205) in malignant cells, but not adjacent
normal or leukocytes (Fig. 6A). Correlating with these results
macrophage conditioned medium increased pSTAT3 levels
in Kras-INK cells in vitro (Fig. 6B). Corresponding with the
activation of STAT3-mediated transcription, we observed
increased IL-6, GP130, and STAT3 mRNA expression in
PDAC cells and increased IL-1b, IL-6, and ARG1 mRNA
expression in macrophages when cocultured in a Transwell
(Fig. 6C). To determine if STAT3 was necessary for TAMmediated regulation of PDAC TICs, we used small-molecule
inhibitors of STAT3 signaling [STATIC (37) and WP1066]
and STAT3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs. Treatment with STATIC or WP1066 abrogated the formation of
tumor spheroids in the presence or absence of BM-MAC-CM
(Fig. 6D and E). In addition, partial suppression of STAT3
expression (50%–60%) using shRNA reduced the induction
of tumor spheroid formation by BM-MAC-CM (Fig. 6E).
Inhibition of STAT3 by either STATIC or shRNA was sufﬁcient to overcome the chemoprotective effects of macrophage coculture (Fig. 6F and G). These data suggest that
TAMs induce TIC properties and chemoresistance through
the activation of STAT3.
STAT3 signaling is necessary for TIC-induced
immunosuppression
We next sought to understand how STAT3 activation in TICs
regulated the immunosuppressive capacity of TAMs. To
accomplish this, we analyzed the effects of shRNA against
STAT3 on PDAC-induced immunosuppression. Corresponding to our previous results, ALDHBright KCM cells, but not KCM
ALDHDim cells, stably expressing shRNA against LacZ robustly

induced BM-MAC–mediated suppression of CD8þ T-cell proliferation. In contrast, ALDHBright KCM cells expressing STAT3
shRNA were unable to enhance BM-MAC–mediated CD8þ Tcell suppression (Fig. 7A).
To understand the clinical implications of these interactions, we analyzed a TMA containing specimens from 59
patients with PDAC. Tumors were scored for the presence of
CD68þ and CD8þ leukocytes and stratiﬁed into 2 groups
(CD68Hi/CD8Lo and CD68Lo/CD8Hi). We observed that in
patients in whom CD68þ macrophages were the dominant
tumor-inﬁltrating leukocyte (CD68Hi/CD8Lo), overall survival
was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with all other groups
(denoted as CD68Lo/CD8Hi; Fig. 7B). Similarly, stratiﬁcation
of patients by epithelial pSTAT3 revealed that high pSTAT3
indicated reduced survival (Fig. 7C). Combined analysis found
that CD68þ leukocytes, but not CD8þ T cells, correlated with
epithelial pSTAT3 intensity (Spearman r ¼ 0.32, P ¼ 0.024) and
tumors classiﬁed as CD68Hi/CD8Lo had increased epithelial
pSTAT3 (Fig. 7D). Taken together, these results suggest that
epithelial STAT3 signaling is high in tumors in which macrophages likely play an immunosuppressive role (e.g., CD68Hi
/CD8Lo tumors) and targeting TAMS in these patients could
result in improved survival.

Discussion
Our results show that inhibiting CSF1R or CCR2 signaling
can increase chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy and block metastasis
by the combined action of reducing TIC numbers, and overcome macrophage-induced CD8þ CTL suppression. We illustrate that macrophages can directly induce TIC properties in
PDAC cells by enhancing STAT3 activation and that STAT3þ
TICs enhance TAM-mediated immunosuppression. Thus,
cross-talk between TAMs and TICs through STAT3 regulates
the chemotherapeutic response by repressing antitumor CTL
activity (Fig. 7E).
CCR2 and CSF1R as regulators of myeloid responses
Tumor-inﬁltrating innate immune cells are composed of
diverse cellular populations including G-MDSCs, M-MDSCs,
tie-2þ angiogenic monocytes and myeloid-derived dendritic
cells. We found that blockade of CSF1R or CCR2 result in a very
similar spectrum of alterations in tumor-inﬁltrating myeloid
cells both reducing mature CD11bþLy6GL6CMid-Lo
MHCIIHiF480þ macrophages and CD11bþLy6GL6CHi
MHCIIþF480þ monocytes. Although the effects of CCR2 and
CSF1R blockade on tumor-inﬁltrating leukocytes are similar,
their mechanisms of action are likely divergent. Studies have

suggested that CCR2 mediates the trafﬁcking of circulating
Ly6CHiCCR2þCX3CR1Lo inﬂammatory monocytes to target
tissues (38, 39), whereas CSF1R is more likely involved in
maturation and/or survival of these cells at inﬂamed sites.
Both receptors can affect bone marrow mobilization. In this
and previous studies, signiﬁcantly reduced macrophage inﬁltration was observed as early as 2 to 4 days after CSF1R
inhibition (4). In contrast, CCR2 inhibition reduced monocyte
numbers in 4 days but only depleted TAMs after 8 days of
treatment. Neither CSF1R nor CCR2 blockade resulted in
dramatic alterations in circulating monocyte numbers over
these periods. Thus, these results suggest that CCR2 inhibition
may affect recruitment of inﬂammatory monocytes from the
circulation, whereas CSF1R inhibition may affect survival of
monocytes/macrophages at the tumor site.
Tumor-inﬁltrating immature granulocytes delineated as
CD11bþLy6GHi are often composed of highly heterogeneous
populations, which can include tumor-activated neutrophils
and G-MDSCs (40). GM-CSF–dependent mobilization and
activation of these cells have been shown to mediate suppression of CTL responses in PDAC tumors (30, 31). However, in
this study, targeting either CCR2 or CSF1R did not reduce the
presence of CD11bþLy6GHi cells (Fig. 2). These ﬁndings suggest
that in the context of chemotherapy, CD11bþLy6GHi cells
cannot overcome the loss of TAMs and M-MDSC. While not
observed in this model, gemcitabine treatment has been shown
to reduce the numbers of G-MDSCs in mammary tumors (41)
and may affect the immunosuppressive capacity of G-MDSCs
in PDAC. Alternatively, the depletion of TAMs may alter the
cellular activity CD11bþLy6GHi cells, pushing them toward
more mature, less immunosuppressive phenotypes. These
differences in immune responses following CCR2 or CSF1/
CSF1R inhibition are likely important considerations for their
clinical application.
Inﬂammation and TICs
STAT3 activity has been shown to be required for the
expansion and maintenance of cancer stem cells in several
cancers (33, 34). In pancreatic cancer, epithelial deletion of
STAT3 results in signiﬁcantly reduced Kras-induced tumor
formation in part through alterations in matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) expression and decreased immune inﬁltration (35). These data are consistent with the idea that reciprocal cross-talk between leukocytes and cancer cells sustain
tumor progression. Work by Jinushi and colleagues showed
that macrophage-derived MGF-E8 and IL-6 enhance stem-like
properties in lung and colon cancer cells by activating STAT3
(10). Similarly, we revealed that depletion of TAMs by CSF1R or
CCR2 inhibition leads to reduced STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig.
6) and decreased numbers of ALDHBright TICs. However,
regulation of STAT3 activation may be one of several pathways
regulating this process. TAMs are potent producers of WNTs
and Sonic hedgehog ligands as well as growth factors, such as
EGF, basic ﬁbroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth
factor, and hepatocyte growth factor, many of which have been
implicated in stimulating cancer stem-like properties (42, 43).
In addition, factors such as VEGF, MMP9, and Bv8 emanating
from tumor-inﬁltrating myeloid cells can signiﬁcantly alter the

www.aacrjournals.org

quality of tumor vasculature, and endothelial cell/tumor cell
interactions may be a critical component of the cancer stem
cell niche (44–46). Thus, multiple pathways are likely regulated
by tumor inﬂammation to inﬂuence the prevalence of TICs.
Macrophages and chemosensitivity
Several recent studies revealed that macrophages can
directly regulate tumor cell chemoresistance. Previous work
by Shree and colleagues (27) and Gocheva and colleagues
(47) has illustrated that macrophage-derived cathepsins
regulate pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor progression and
mammary tumor response to paclitaxel. Intriguingly,
cathepsin activity has also been revealed as necessary for
the secretion and processing of proinﬂammatory cytokines.
However, the manner in which these activities affect mammary TICs or STAT3 activation is not known. In addition,
targeting CCR2 in the tumor microenvironment has been
shown to improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic regimens by regulating the tumor vasculature (48). These observations further stress the importance of TAMs and the
complexity of their roles in the tumor microenvironment.
Clinical prospective
Therapeutic resistance and metastatic spread deﬁne the
lethality of aggressive cancers. Thus, understanding and targeting the mechanisms responsible is critical to improving
therapeutic outcomes. Several studies have indicated that
targeting key pathways regulating TIC survival and/or differentiation can overcome therapeutic resistance. However, the
durability of such therapies remains unproven, as such targeting the tumor stromal responses that support tumor "stemness" is an attractive alternative.
