BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of additional chemotherapy in preventing intrahepatic distant tumor recurrence of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully established. The authors compared the efficacy of 2 platinumbased chemotherapeutic agents in combination with radical local treatment for preventing intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR). METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with stage I/II HCC aged 45 to 85 years underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and/or radiofrequency ablation after they received hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of
platinum compounds. The HAI consisted of cis-diammine(1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) (carboplatin) in
25 patients and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin) in 53 patients. Multivariate analysis was used to identify
independent factors that were associated with IDR. RESULTS: Cumulative IDR rates at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years
were 21.7%, 52.2% and 75.7%, respectively, in the carboplatin group and 8.1%, 22.7%, and 36.9%, respectively, in the
cisplatin group. The cisplatin group had a significantly lower IDR rate compared with the carboplatin group. The
selection of a platinum agent was 1 of the independent factors for IDR in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards
model. CONCLUSIONS: HAI chemotherapy with cisplatin before radical local treatment was effective in patients
with HCC. The authors concluded that radical local treatment with concurrent HAI using cisplatin may contribute to a
longer progression-free period, which could be predicted with intrahepatic imaging in patients with stage I/II HCC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with severe complications in patients with cirrhosis or chronic
hepatitis who have severe fibrosis. Although the treatment outcome of HCC recently has improved, intrahepatic recurrence occurs at a high rate of 10% to 25% annually despite radical treatment; and, in many patients, HCC recurrence
leads to fatal consequences.1
Previous reports have indicated that preoperative transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) did not prevent recurrence after hepatectomy or improve patient outcomes in randomized controlled trials.2 However, retrospective studies reported some efficacy of these techniques but with questionable significance.3,4
More effective chemotherapy, received preoperatively by patients with intrahepatic micrometastases or with the possibility of intraoperative tumor spread, may prevent tumor recurrence in the residual liver and further improve prognosis,
although few reports have described such chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy generally is not effective in most patients
with HCC. Chemotherapy often may impair liver function in patients who have disease complicated by cirrhosis.
Currently, systemic chemotherapy is used infrequently in the treatment of HCC with cytotoxic anticancer agents. Compared with systemic chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion (HAI), chemotherapy has the advantages of increasing the
local concentration of chemotherapeutic agents to kill cancer cells without damaging healthy liver tissue and of reducing
systemic side effects.

Arterial Infusion of Platinum in HCC/Ishikawa et al

Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin) is a
key drug in the standard regimens for various cancers in
the respiratory, digestive, and genitourinary organs.5
Recently, treatment with cisplatin for advanced HCC has
produced some encouraging results.6-8 We previously
reported on the characteristics of cisplatin treatment for
HCC.9 In Japan, a fine powder formulation of cisplatin
was marketed in 2004 that allowed the preparation of a
high-concentration, aqueous cisplatin solution. Many
nephrotoxic and emetic effects associated with cisplatin
have been reported, and cis-diammine(1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) (carboplatin) has demonstrated
antitumor activity comparable to that of cisplatin with
fewer nephrotoxic and emetic effects than those of cisplatin. Carboplatin has been regarded as a useful anticancer
agent for HCC.10 In the current study, we investigated
the efficacy of radical local treatment in combination with
HAI chemotherapy with the platinum-based agents carboplatin and cisplatin in the prevention of intrahepatic
distant recurrence (IDR).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
This was a single-center, explorative, prospective cohort
study in patients with stage I/II HCC. All patients met the
following criteria: unresectable disease (including rejection of hepatectomy) or difficulty tolerating surgery (age,
condition of vital organs, etc), a performance status of
0 to 2, normal cardiac function on an electrocardiogram,
normal renal function (normal serum creatinine, blood
urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL), impaired liver function (total
bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of normal, aspartate and
alanine aminotransferase levels 4 times the upper limit of
normal), and ages 20 to 85 years. All patients provided
written informed consent. The study was approved by the
local ethics committee in accordance with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.
Cisplatin was approved as an agent for HCC in July
2007 using phase 2 clinical trial data from studies conducted in Japan. The safety data of cisplatin were not
enough at the beginning of this clinical trial. Therefore,
the target number of enrolled patients was 50 in cisplatin
group.
Treatment Procedure
Only 1 course of HAI with a platinum compound anticancer agent in both groups was conducted before patients
underwent radical local treatment. A catheter was intro-

duced into the proper hepatic artery by using the Seldinger technique followed by an intra-arterial infusion of
either carboplatin 300 mg/m2 over 30 minutes or of the
fine powder formulation of cisplatin (IA-call; Nippon
Kayaku Company Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) 65 mg/m2 over
30 minutes. Cisplatin (100 mg per vial) was dissolved in
70 mL of normal saline that was heated to 50 C (cisplatin
concentration, 1.43 mg/mL).
Next, the catheter was inserted as selectively as possible into vessels feeding the tumor, as indicated by tumor
staining. Then, an epirubicin-lipiodol suspension (epirubicin [Farmorbicin]; Kyowa Hakko Kirin Company, Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan; lipiodol [iodized oil]; Andre Guerget,
Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) was infused according to the
greatest dimension of the tumor until stasis of blood flow
of the target artery was observed. In addition, we embolized the hepatic artery with a gelatin sponge to obtain
complete necrosis.
A combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 antagonist with corticosteroids was administered to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity. For the prevention of renal toxicity,
hydration was maintained by infusing fluid (1000 mL
before the administration of cisplatin followed by
1500 mL daily for 1 week after the administration of cisplatin) to ensure sufficient diuresis.
The TACE procedure is not always an ideal radical
local treatment for HCC. Kagawa et al reported that
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with TACE is
an efficient and safe treatment that provides overall
survival rates similar to those achieved with surgical resection.11 Therefore, we believe that the additional RFA
treatment contributes to complete necrosis if the patient
cannot obtain a complete response with TACE. In
patients who could receive an ablation therapy after
TACE, RFA was given as additional ablation therapy.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of the current clinical study was
IDR, which we defined as the recurrence of a new lesion
developing at a different subsegment away from the previous tumor area site of radical local treatment (excluding
extrahepatic metastasis). IDR rates were calculated using
the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests, and the generalized Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis.
Regarding the patient characteristics, statistical analyses
were performed using the Fisher exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A Cox proportional hazards model
was used to identify independent factors of IDR. The level
of significance was P < .05. Adverse events were evaluated

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of 221 patients who were admitted to Saiseikai Niigata
Daini Hospital for primary HCC between April 2002
and December 2008, 78 patients who were diagnosed
with stage I/II HCC received HAI of platinum compounds, underwent TACE and RFA because of poor
tolerance to surgery, and achieved local control. Of 78
patients (47 men and 31 women; mean age, 63 years), 25
received carboplatin between April 2002 and October
2004, and 53 received cisplatin between July 2004 and
September 2008. These patients were included in the
study because they could be followed over an extended
period.
The patients were enrolled consecutively. We
observed all patients after 1 week, when we confirmed
their complete response in the local treatment area.
Although the levels of protein induced by vitamin K
absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) were significantly
higher in the cisplatin group, there were no significant differences between the carboplatin group and the cisplatin
group in patient characteristics, baseline liver function
tests (including total bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time), clinical stage, and liver function (Table 1). The
median follow-up was 36.6 months (range, 1.6-84.6
months).
Recurrence Rate
Cumulative IDR rates at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were
21.7%, 52.2%, and 75.7%, respectively, in the carboplatin group and 8.1%, 22.7%, and 36.9%, respectively, in
the cisplatin group (log-rank test, P Â¼ .0011; generalized
Wilcoxon test, P Â¼ .0044). The IDR was significantly
lower in the cisplatin group (Fig. 1).
Univariate and Multivariate Analyses of
Predictors of Recurrence
In univariate analysis, significant factors that affected IDR
were sex, serum albumin level, prothrombin time, platelet
count, and drug. In multivariate analysis, independent
factors that affected IDR were drug (carboplatin vs cisplatin: hazard ratio, 0.369; 95% confidence interval, 0.1740.781; P Â¼ .0092) and prothrombin time (>80% vs
80%: hazard ratio, 3.226; 95% confidence interval,
1.044-9.969; P Â¼ .0418) (Tables 2 and 3).

are illustrated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Adverse Events
In the carboplatin group, grade 3 leukopenia and grade 3
thrombocytopenia were observed in 2 patients (8%) and
1 patient (4%), respectively. In the cisplatin group, 1
patient (1.8%) experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia,
and 1 patient (1.8%) experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Grade 3 elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels
were observed in 2 patients (3.7%), all of whom patients
recovered within 1 month. There was no grade 3 or grade
4 leukopenia.

DISCUSSION
The prognosis for patients with HCC has improved dramatically with the identification of high-risk populations
and the advancement of diagnostic imaging and treatment. However, recurrence of HCC is frequent in the
early post-treatment period, even in patients who undergo
radical hepatectomy or receive radical local treatment,
including percutaneous treatment. The recurrence rate after treatment for HCC is higher than that for cancer in
other organs. A possible factor is the growth of residual
micrometastases in the liver that cannot be observed on
imaging studies. Patients with HCC are likely to develop
intrahepatic metastases through the portal vein at a relatively early stage, and there is a risk that micrometastases
not observed on imaging may remain in the liver after
treatment of the primary lesion. The majority of early
metastases are residual liver recurrences associated with
intrahepatic metastases after radical resection of HCC.

with chronic viral inflammation is a factor in tumor

recurrence. Sakon et al12 evaluated the recurrence rate of
HCC after complete resection and reported that many
recurrences within 2 years after surgery were the result of
residual intrahepatic metastases; whereas, at 4 years postsurgery, recurrence was mainly the result of multicentric
liver carcinogenesis. Those authors concluded that additional therapy, including HAI chemotherapy, as well as
the prevention of carcinogenesis in the liver may be appropriate during the 2 years after surgery.
Several clinical trials have been performed with the
aim of preventing tumor recurrence; and, in the initial
reports of preoperative TACE, Imaoka and Sasaki13
reported that, among 103 patients with HCC who underwent curative resection, the 2-year relapse-free survival
(RFS) rate in 37 patients who received preoperative
TACE using cisplatin was significantly better at 72%
compared with an RFS rate of 46% in 14 patients who
received preoperative TACE using doxorubicin, and the
RFS rate was 54% in 52 patients who did not receive preoperative TACE. Zhang et al14 reported that, in a multivariate analysis of RFS in 1457 patients who underwent
hepatectomy, preoperative TACE was an independent
prognostic factor and was beneficial in preventing tumor
recurrence in patients who received 2 sessions of preoperative TACE. In a study of 100 patients who had
tumors that measured <5 cm in greatest dimension, Di

4022

Carlo et al15 observed that overall survival and RFS were
significantly longer in 55 patients who received preoperative TACE than in 45 control patients. Conversely, Paye
et al16 observed no difference in overall survival or RFS
between patients with identical characteristics who did
and did not receive preoperative TACE. Nagasue et al17
compared 31 patients who received preoperative TACE
with 107 patients who did not receive preoperative TACE
and observed complications from TACE, including severe
adhesion, gall bladder infarction, liver infarction, and liver
abscess in 15 patients (48%) at laparotomy. Those authors
reported that preoperative TACE was not useful, because
survival rates did not differ significantly between the
groups. Uchida et al18 reported that preoperative TACE
increased the number of deaths from other causes, such as
hepatic failure and gastrointestinal bleeding; and, in the
long term, the prognosis was poor. However, a conclusion
cannot easily be reached, because those reports were retrospective in nature, and the number of patients, the agents
used for TACE, the number of TACE treatments, and the
patient characteristics differed among groups.
We identified 2 reports on randomized clinical trials
of preoperative TAE.19,20 One was a multicenter,
randomized, controlled trial conducted in Japan that
examined the effects of preoperative TAE without any
chemotherapeutic agents in patients with HCC who had

Cancer

tumors measuring between 2 cm and 5 cm. The results
from that study demonstrated that there was no significant difference in either the 5-year survival rate or the 5year RFS rate between the preoperative TAE group and
the no preoperative TAE group, and preoperative TAE
produced no beneficial effects in preventing recurrence or
improving prognosis after liver resection. A subgroup
analysis of the necrosis rate after preoperative TAE also
demonstrated no significant difference in the survival rate
or the RFS rate.20
If the purpose of preoperative TAE (or TACE) is to
prevent tumor spread arising from intrahepatic micrometastases that are present at the time of hepatectomy or
from intraoperative manipulation, then it is not beneficial
to perform preoperative TAE (or TACE) uniformly,
regardless of whether patients have intrahepatic micrometastases. However, it may be possible to demonstrate
the efficacy of preoperative TAE (or TACE) if the procedure is undergone by patients who have intrahepatic
micrometastases or the possibility of intraoperative tumor
spread. Controversy exists with regard to the prevention
of tumor recurrence and survival rates after preoperative
TAE (or TACE) for any additional treatments.
HAI chemotherapy sometimes may be chosen as a
therapeutic option for HCC. TAI also is used frequently
as a treatment option for advanced HCC because of poor
liver function. The agents used for HAI include cisplatin,
doxorubicin, epirubicin, fluorouracil, mitomycin C,
mitoxantrone, and zinostatin stimalamer (a conjugate
protein or copolymer of styrene-maleic acid and the antitumor protein neocarzinostatin), but there is no evidence
available to define the criteria for selecting these drugs,
and standard chemotherapy has not been established.
Generally, HCC is less sensitive to chemotherapeutic
agents, and the response rate of systemic chemotherapy is
<20%. Furthermore, sufficient doses of chemotherapeutic agents cannot be given because of poor tolerability as a
result of concurrent liver disease, including chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Therefore, standard treatment has not
been established, although there are many chemotherapy
regimens for HCC. We had a patient with stage IVA
HCC who achieved a complete response after having enteric tegafur/uracil (UFT-E) alone, and no recurrence was
observed.21 We reported the efficacy of UFT-E in patients
with stage IV HCC who received UFT-E alone, in whom
interventional radiology, liver resection, TACE, chemolipiodolization, and intra-arterial infusion were not deemed
feasible.22 We also had a patient with HCC who had lung
metastases who successfully responded to multimodal

treatment, including cisplatin-based chemotherapy.23,24
Thus, the selection of appropriate chemotherapeutic
agents may be important in HCC. In the clinical setting,
intrahepatic metastasis frequently determines prognosis
even when extrahepatic metastasis is present; and, in that
context, HAI is promising. Compared with systemic
chemotherapy, HAI requires techniques like as catheter
placement and has disadvantages, including reservoir
management and a risk of damage to blood vessels caused
by catheter insertion, but it allows the direct delivery of
high doses of chemotherapeutic agents to the tumor site
and reduces the systemic concentration of chemotherapeutic agents to a low level, which may result in a lower
incidence of adverse drug reactions. Court et al25 reported
that, in cisplatin-based chemotherapy, HAI enabled
greater drug accumulation within the tumor compared
with systemic chemotherapy. Although there is no sufficient evidence to support the finding that HAI is more
useful than systemic chemotherapy as treatment for
HCC, we believe that it is necessary to deliver a high dose
of chemotherapeutic agents to the liver to prevent liver recurrence from residual micrometastases, and we have used
HAI as additional chemotherapy. Conventionally, anthracycline chemotherapeutic agents have been used in the
HAI regimen; although, recently, platinum compounds
have been used to treat HCC.9
Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent that consists
of a platinum complex compound. It is linked to DNA
chains in cells through passive diffusion and active transport; then, it exerts an apoptotic effect by inhibiting DNA
synthesis and subsequent cell division. The antitumor activity of cisplatin is classified into concentration-dependent, fast-acting, and slow-acting groups. The percentage
of cisplatin taken up by HCC through first-pass kinetics
after HAI reportedly is 48.4% (range, 34.2%-55%).25
The local concentration of cisplatin reportedly is >10
times higher than that after intravenous administration,
and cisplatin is expected to produce an enhanced therapeutic effect after selective HAI at a high dose, resulting in
a concentration-dependent apoptotic effect. Unlike the
chemotherapeutic agents that are excreted in bile, such as
anthracyclines, cisplatin does not undergo metabolism by
cytochrome P450 and is excreted mainly in urine; thus, it
is considered a favorable agent that can be administered
even to patients with cirrhosis who have a reduced hepatic
reserve capacity.
In Japan, cisplatin was marketed in starting in 2004
as high-concentration, aqueous cisplatin solution. The
reported response rate after HAI of high-concentration,

4023

Original Article

aqueous cisplatin solution was 33.8%.26 In the future, cisplatin well may have a pivotal role in chemotherapy for
HCC.9 Cisplatin is associated with renal and auditory
toxicity. In the clinical setting, carboplatin sometimes is
used to reduce toxicity. Carboplatin is a cisplatin derivative that has similar antitumor activity in some regions
and has been associated with less severe adverse drug reactions of gastrointestinal symptoms and renal dysfunction
than cisplatin. However, carboplatin causes severe myelosuppression, especially thrombocytopenia, which is a
dose-limiting toxicity of carboplatin.5 Systemic administration of carboplatin is performed by multiple courses of
intravenous infusion, each course consisting of 300 mg/
m2 to 400 mg/m2 once daily with a 4-week washout period. Combination chemotherapy, including carboplatin,
reportedly is effective in the treatment of HCC.27-30 In
the current study, we performed HAI with cisplatin and
carboplatin before patients underwent radical local treatment with the aim of preventing recurrence of HCC at an
early stage. We compared the 2 agents. Woo et al studied
the period of IDR from the initial response to TACE
treatment and observed that the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year
cumulative IDR rates patients were 27%, 45%, and 65%,
respectively. In our study, the cumulative IDR rates at 1
year, 2 years, and 3 years were 21.7%, 52.2%, and 75.7%,
respectively, in the carboplatin group and 8.1%, 22.7%,
and 36.9%, respectively, in the cisplatin group. Our
cumulative IDR rate in the carboplatin group was similar
that reported by Woo et al.31 These results suggest that
HAI with carboplatin may not prevent IDR. Although
both agents were administered to the whole liver, cisplatin
was significantly more effective in preventing IDR in the
residual liver. Although PIVKA-II status was significantly
higher in the cisplatin group, considering the a-fetoprotein status, PIVKA II could be ruled out as a factor of
recurrence.
In multivariate analysis, independent factors that
affected IDR were drug (carboplatin vs cisplatin) and prothrombin time (>80% vs 80%). Prothrombin time,
which reflects hepatic function, was identified as the
second factor. Because patients who had positive hepatitis
viral status tended to have prolonged prothrombin time
(>80%, 13 of 21 patients [61.9%]; 80%, 48 of 57
patients [84.2%]), these patients were considered to have
advanced viral cirrhosis.
Although there were more patients in our cisplatin
group who received RFA treatment (n Â¼ 41, 77.4%) than
in our carboplatin group (n Â¼ 13, 52%), we did not
observe any statistical difference with regard to RFA status

for the extent of recurrent disease (P Â¼ .9749). The results
demonstrating a significant, preventive effect against IDR
in the cisplatin group suggest the usefulness of whole-liver
treatment with HAI, although a comparison with an
untreated group was not made. Therefore, we conclude
that radical local treatment and concurrent HAI with cisplatin may contribute to a longer progression-free period
at which can be diagnosed on intrahepatic imaging studies
in patients with stage I/II HCC. In the future, we expect
that a prospective study of whole-liver treatment with cisplatin and an assessment of dosing frequency will contribute toward improving prognosis and preventing IDR in
patients with HCC.
