Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)

BACKGROUND: The incidence of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals declined after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
in the mid-1990s, but the cancer risk associated with HIV infection during the HAART era remains to be clarified.
METHODS: Cancer incidence among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected participants in the Multicenter AIDS (acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome) Cohort Study (MACS) between 1984 and 2007 was compared with the expected incidence using US population-based data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Ageand race-adjusted cancer incidence rates were also compared HIV by status and over time within the MACS. Exact
statistical methods were used for all analyses. RESULTS: A total of 933 incident cancers were observed during 77,320
person-years of follow-up. Compared with SEER, MACS HIV-infected men had significantly (P < .05) elevated rates of
KS (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 139.10), NHL (SIR, 36.80), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)(SIR, 7.30), and anal cancer
(SIR, 25.71). Within MACS, HIV infection was found to be independently associated with each of these cancers across
the entire follow-up period, and KS (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 54.93), NHL (IRR, 11.18), and anal cancer (IRR, 18.50)
were each found to be significantly elevated among HIV-infected men during the HAART era. Among these men, the
incidence of KS and NHL declined (IRR, 0.13 and 0.23, respectively), the incidence of anal cancer increased (IRR,
5.84), and the incidence of HL remained statistically unchanged (IRR, 0.75) from the pre-HAART to the HAART era.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer risk remains elevated among HIV-infected men who have sex with men, highlighting the

The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the mid-1990s led to a substantial decline in the
incidence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies (ADMs) Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and,
to a lesser degree, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus

(HIV),1-5 but the incidence of these ADMs remains elevated.3,5 During the HAART era, increased morbidity
and mortality from several non-ADMs have also been
reported in this population.6-8 With HIV-infected individuals living longer in the HAART era1,9 and because the
risk of most human malignancies increases with age,10 it is
important to determine whether HIV infection is associated with long-term cancer risk independent of aging.11,12
Many recent studies linking HIV infection with cancer risk have only examined HIV-infected populations.3,4,8,13,14 More robust information regarding the
association between HIV infection and cancer can be
obtained from studies that include an internal comparison
group comprised of HIV-uninfected individuals of similar
demographics and lifestyle behaviors. To that end, we
investigated the association between HIV infection and
cancer using data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort
Study (MACS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Cohort
The MACS is an ongoing observational study of 6972
men who reported having had sex with men (MSM) in 4
metropolitan areas of the United States (Baltimore, MD;
Chicago, IL; Pittsburgh, PA; and Los Angeles, CA) that
began enrollment in 1984. Recruitment and follow-up
procedures were described previously.15,16 During semiannual study visits, interviewer-administered questionnaires
were completed, physical examinations were performed,
and biological specimens were obtained for laboratory
determinations of HIV/AIDS disease biomarkers and for
repository storage. HIV seropositivity was determined
using enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays and confirmed with Western blot assays.15 All data obtained before
March 2008, were included in this analysis. To allow for
lag in reporting of incident cancers, we censored follow-up
time at March 31, 2007, which provided up to 23 years of
accrued follow-up time. Eighteen participants with no follow-up data were excluded from this analysis as were 5 participants who lacked information about race. None of
these 23 excluded participants were diagnosed with cancer.
The MACS protocol and forms (available at http://statepi.
jhsph.edu/macs/macs.html) were approved by the institutional review board at each site. All study participants provided written informed consent.
Study Outcomes: Cancer Classification
Cancers were ascertained continuously during follow-up
using a variety of methods, including study interviews,

5508

medical record abstraction and review, report by self or
next of kin, and review of vital status records including
data from the National Death Index. Through November
2005, the MACS documented the site and histology of all
cancers using the International Classification of Diseases
for Oncology, first edition (ICD-O-1), codes. Since December 2005, all cancers have been documented using
the third edition (ICD-O-3) codes. During 2006, all
ICD-O-1 site and histology codes were converted to the
corresponding ICD-O-3 codes using a standardized algorithm (IARCcrgTools, version 2.03) available from the
International Agency for Cancer Registries17 and then
reviewed by study personnel.
A total of 1027 cancers were documented in the
MACS through March 2007. For this analysis, we
excluded 94 cancers (all 66 squamous or basal cell skin
cancers because these were not documented by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] program, 21 cancers with an unknown source of
documentation, and 7 cancers diagnosed before the date
of enrollment) leaving 933 incident cancers. We combined related cancers into a common category when the
number of observed cancers was small. For example, the
following 8 cancers were classified as oral cavity/pharyngeal cancers: tongue (n ¼ 2), floor of mouth (n ¼ 1), gum
(n ¼ 1), nasopharynx (n ¼ 1), tonsil (n ¼ 2), and hypopharynx (n ¼ 1). This classification yielded 26 separate
cancer categories that were based on SEER cancer site recodes for ICD-O-3.18
Primary Exposures: Risk Factors
The primary exposures of interest were HIV infection and
HAART. HIV status was coded using a time-varying
covariate for which seroconverters were classified as HIV
negative before seroconversion and HIV positive thereafter. To investigate the association of HAART with cancer incidence, we implemented an instrumental variable
approach that has been used previously in analyses of the
effectiveness of HAART on AIDS and death to account
for confounding by indication.19 Specifically, we stratified
follow-up time into 2 periods (the pre-HAART era
[1984-1995] and the HAART era [1996-2007]) to evaluate the association between HIV infection and cancer incidence during calendar periods without and with effective
HIV therapies. For cancers with sufficient numbers in the
HAART era, we also examined cancer incidence in the
early HAART (1996-2000) and current HAART (20012007) eras.
Because lung cancer occurred only among MACS
participants with a history of smoking, we restricted the

Cancer

Cancer Incidence in the MACS: 1984 to 2007/Seaberg et al

lung cancer analyses to the men who reported having ever
smoked cigarettes. We also adjusted for smoking in the
lung cancer models using time-varying indicator variables
to represent a cumulative smoking history of <10 packyears, 10 to 20 pack-years, 20 to 30 pack-years, and >30
pack-years. We did not incorporate any other cancerspecific risk factors into these analyses.
External Comparison Population
We compared cancer incidence in the MACS with that in
the US population-based SEER program.20 Corresponding to the MACS enrollment beginning in 1984, we restricted the SEER data to the 9 registries involved in the
SEER project at that time and used all the cancer incidence data from these 9 registries between 1984 and
2007.
Statistical Analysis
Incidence rates (IR) were computed as the number of incident cancers observed divided by the number of personyears (PY) of follow-up obtained among those at risk for
the given cancer, where the follow-up time available for
each person was the number of years from the baseline
visit until the earliest of the cancer diagnosis date, death,
loss to follow-up, or March 31, 2007. Because each cancer
was analyzed individually, men who developed >1 cancer
(eg, KS and lung cancer) were classified as having incident
cancer in both analyses.
For external comparisons between MACS and
SEER, we calculated the standardized incidence ratio
(SIR), the ratio of the observed to expected number of
incident cancers in the MACS, adjusted for age (5-year
categories), sex (males only), race (Caucasian, African
American, and other), and calendar year. We estimated
SIRs using methods for indirect standardization21 and
generated exact 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and P
values22 separately for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
men. Because a large proportion of KS in the general population occurs among HIV-infected individuals, the SIRs
for KS in an HIV-infected population tends to be underestimated when it is based on concurrent SEER data. To
account for this bias, we also calculated the SIRs for KS
using the SEER data from 1973 to 1979.23
Direct comparisons of the cancer incidence rates by
HIV status and calendar period were performed using
Poisson regression where the covariate effects were summarized using the incidence rate ratio (IRR). All models
were adjusted for age and race, and the lung cancer models
were also adjusted for pack-years using time-dependent

covariates. Exact 95% CIs and 2-sided P values were
obtained using StatXact (release 8.0; Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA) and LogXact (release 8.0;
Cytel Software Corporation). Statistical significance was
inferred for 2-sided P values <.05.

RESULTS
The median age of the 6949 MACS participants at enrollment was 32.6 years; 73% of the men were Caucasian and
42% were HIV positive. During follow-up, 586 (15%) of
the 4009 men who were HIV negative at the time of study
enrollment became infected with HIV. Overall, the median follow-up time was 9.7 years, and 42% of the 77,320
PY of accumulated follow-up time were accrued by HIVinfected men. Cigarette smoking was common among
both HIV-infected (45% active and 19% former smokers)
and HIV-uninfected (40% active and 20% former smokers) men. Among men who had ever smoked, the cumulative exposure was slightly higher for HIV-uninfected men
both at enrollment (median pack-years, 14.6 for HIVinfected and 15.6 for HIV-uninfected men) and at the
end of follow-up (18.2 pack-years and 19.1 pack-years,
respectively).
The 933 incident cancers were diagnosed in 868
participants; 63 men were diagnosed with 2 cancers and 1
man was diagnosed with 3 cancers. The overall cancer IR
was 1206.7 per 100,000 PYs, which differed significantly
by HIV status, age, race, and calendar time (Table 1).
Cancer incidence was highest among HIV-infected men,
Caucasians and other non-African Americans, and before
1996. Regarding age, incidence was highest among men
ages 30 to 39 years old, which was due to the incidence of
ADMs among HIV-infected men during the pre-HAART
era (data not shown). Among HIV-infected men, the
overall cancer IRs in the pre-HAART and HAART eras
were, respectively, 3601.5 (95% CI, 3343.8-3871.3) and
965.9 (95% CI, 798.8-1157.6) per 100,000 PYs. The
corresponding IRs among HIV-uninfected men were,
respectively, 137.3 (95% CI, 98.1-186.9) and 291.2
(95% CI, 213.2-388.4) per 100,000 PYs.
Comparisons of cancer-specific incidence in the
MACS with that from the SEER program are shown in
Table 2. The most frequent cancer among HIV-infected
MACS participants was KS (n ¼ 552) followed by NHL
(n ¼ 194). Of the non-ADMs, the most common cancers
were anal cancer (n ¼ 15), prostate cancer (n ¼ 12), and
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)(n ¼ 9) among HIV-infected
men, and prostate cancer (n ¼ 25) and melanoma (n ¼ 7)
among men without HIV. Overall, we observed 86

incident cancers among the HIV-uninfected MACS participants, and this number was significantly lower than
the 160.0 cancers that were expected (SIR, 0.53; 95% CI,
0.43-0.66). No specific cancer occurred significantly
more often than expected among these men, but colon,
lung, and renal cancers occurred significantly less often
than expected. In contrast, the overall cancer incidence
was significantly higher than expected (SIR, 10.79; 95%
CI, 10.07-11.53) among HIV-infected men, and this was
driven largely by KS and NHL, which comprised 88% of
all cancers in this subgroup. HIV-infected men also had
significantly elevated SIRs for all non-ADMs (SIR, 1.46;
95% CI, 1.19-1.78), and individually for anal cancer, testicular cancer, HL, and poorly defined cancers.
Direct comparisons of cancer incidence rates among
HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected MACS participants
are shown in Table 3. Adjusted for age and race (and for
smoking in the lung cancer analysis), HIV infection was
found to be significantly associated with higher rates of
anal cancer (IRR, 13.57), HL (IRR, 13.29), poorly
defined cancers (IRR, 9.53), and, as expected, with both
KS (IRR, 374.73) and NHL (IRR, 48.71). HIV-infected
men also had elevated rates of liver (IRR, 5.69), testicular
(IRR, 3.97), melanoma (IRR, 2.68), oral cavity/pharyngeal (IRR, 2.64), and lung (IRR, 2.59) cancers, but these
differences were not significant at the .05 level.
We restricted the comparisons of cancer incidence
in the pre-HAART versus HAART eras to the 7 cancers

5510

that occurred in at least 10 MACS participants (KS,
NHL, anal cancer, HL, lung cancer, melanoma, and
prostate cancer). The results, stratified by HIV status,
are shown in Table 4. Among HIV-infected men, the
age- and race-adjusted incidence rates of KS and NHL
declined by 87% and 77%, respectively, from the preHAART era to the HAART era. In contrast, the incidence of anal cancer increased significantly (IRR, 5.84)
in this group after the introduction of HAART,
whereas the IRs for the other non-ADMs remained statistically unchanged. None of the age- and race-adjusted
(and smoking-adjusted) cancer IRs were found to
change significantly over time among HIV-uninfected
men.
Whereas the adjusted incidence of KS and NHL
declined dramatically after the introduction of HAART,
the incidence of both cancers (IRRs of 54.93 and 11.18,
respectively) remained significantly elevated among HIVinfected versus HIV-uninfected men during the HAART
era (Table 5). Among men with HIV, the incidence of
both KS and NHL continued to decline significantly
from the early HAART era (1996-2000) to the current
HAART era (2001-2007), with the adjusted IRRs comparing the late to early HAART eras being 0.44 (95% CI,
0.20-0.92) for KS and 0.23 (95% CI, 0.10-0.52) for
NHL. Nevertheless, the incidence of both ADMs
remained significantly higher among HIV-infected versus
HIV-uninfected men during the current HAART era

(IRR, 17.76 [95% CI, 2.59-771.24] for KS; IRR, 6.44
[95% CI, 1.61-37.37] for NHL).
Among the non-ADMs evaluated during the
HAART era (Table 5), the incidence of anal cancer was
found to be significantly higher among HIV-infected versus HIV-uninfected men (IRR, 18.50). In contrast to the
temporal findings for KS and NHL, anal cancer incidence
increased from the early HAART era to the current
HAART era among HIV-infected men (IRR, 3.11; 95%
CI, 0.60-31.44), but this increase was not statistically significant. The age-adjusted, race-adjusted, and pack-yearsadjusted incidence of lung cancer was also found to be

5512

elevated among HIV-infected men during the HAART
era (IRR, 5.98), but this difference was not statistically
significant. Similarly, HIV was not found to be associated
with the incidence of HL, melanoma, or prostate cancer
during the HAART era.

DISCUSSION
The dramatic decline in the incidence of KS and NHL
noted in the MACS since HAART was introduced in the
mid-1990s is consistent with reports that HAART has
greatly reduced the likelihood of HIV-related outcomes
including cancer2,3 and mortality.24 However, in contrast
to other reports,4 we found that the incidence of these
ADMs continued to decline during the HAART era
among HIV-infected men, which offers hope that the
excess risk of KS and NHL due to HIV may be eliminated
in the future. Increased HAART use or the development
of more effective HAART regimens over time might
explain the continued decline in the incidence of these
ADMs during the HAART era. It is also possible that cancer incidence during the early HAART era was elevated
due to the lag between the beginning of the widespread
availability of HAART in 1996 and the time when
HAART could begin to impact cancer incidence because
a portion of the cancers detected during the early HAART
era were likely to have existed yet were early stage and
remained undetected during the pre-HAART era. Other
possible explanations include a cancer reporting lag in the
MACS, even though our study design accounted for this
lag, and a survival bias in which persons at highest risk for
developing these cancers were removed from the cohort
over time. Nevertheless, similar to other authors,4 we
found that HIV infection remained significantly associated with an increased risk of these ADMs after 2000.
Further analyses of the etiologic mechanisms underlying
the development of these cancers are required to determine whether the excess risk of ADMs due to HIV can be
entirely eliminated by HAART.
The incidence of anal cancer among HIV-infected
MACS participants was significantly elevated when compared with both the external SEER population and the
HIV-uninfected MACS participants. Adjusted for age
and race, anal cancer incidence was found to have
increased significantly from the pre-HAART era to the
HAART era, and it did not decrease during the HAART
era. In a prior MACS analysis, anal cancer risk during the
HAART era was found to be elevated among those with
more exposure to unprotected receptive anal intercourse,

and concurrent HAART use did not decrease this risk.25
Thus, MACS data are consistent with the finding that
HAART may not be associated with the regression or
clearance of anal intraepithelial neoplasias or their causally
associated human papillomavirus (HPV) infections
during the HAART era.26,27 Whether more effective
HAART regimens or earlier HAART initiation might
affect the development of anal cancer remains unknown.
The potential link between HIV infection and lung
cancer has received much attention recently. In contrast to
other studies,28,29 we did not observe a statistically significant association between HIV infection and lung cancer
among MACS participants with a history of smoking cigarettes after controlling for age, race, and pack-years.
Although the adjusted lung cancer incidence rate among
MACS smokers during the HAART era was nearly 6
times greater for HIV-infected versus HIV-uninfected

men, this result must be interpreted with great caution
given the small number of lung cancers observed since
1996 in the MACS and the extremely wide 95% CI for
this estimate.
HL was found to be strongly and significantly associated with HIV infection in the MACS, and the incidence of HL was similar in the pre-HAART and HAART
eras. This finding is consistent with another report that
HL incidence did not differ significantly by calendar period or by the use of combination antiretroviral therapy.30
Among persons diagnosed with AIDS, 1 study group
noted that the unadjusted incidence of HL increased by
>50% after HAART became widely available, a result
that they attributed to HAART-related improvements in
CD4 counts and interpreted as suggesting that the characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells may require the presence of
CD4 T-cells for HL to develop.31 Because the incidence

of HL in the MACS did not increase in the HAART era,
further analyses that incorporate CD4 data are required to
determine whether our data are consistent with this
hypothesis.
We also observed a significant excess of poorly
defined cancers among the HIV-infected MACS participants. It is interesting to note that 9 of these 10 cancers
did not have a documented cancer site, suggesting that
they may have been diagnosed very late in the disease
course, after widespread metastasis. Thus, it is plausible
that HIV infection had an impact on the progression and
late diagnosis of these cancers, but it is unknown whether
or not HIV was etiologically related to their onset.
The most commonly observed non-ADM in the
current study was prostate cancer, which, when adjusted
for age and race, occurred at similar rates among HIVinfected and HIV-uninfected MACS participants. This
finding is not inconsistent with the conflicting reports
from other studies that found HIV/AIDS to be associated
with an increased14,32 or decreased4,33 risk of prostate cancer. Although these studies either focused on men with a
prior AIDS diagnosis or were based primarily on a comparison with external population-based data, our internal
comparison of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men
provides a direct evaluation of the association between
HIV infection and prostate cancer.

5514

Other non-ADMs that have been reported to be
increased among HIV-infected men include melanoma,32
liver cancer,34 oral cancer,13 stomach cancer,35 and testicular seminoma.36 None of these were found to be significantly associated with HIV infection in the current study.
Several explanations may account for these results.
Because these cancers were rarely observed in the MACS,
we had little statistical power with which to detect a significant association. For example, we found that HIV infection had an adjusted IRR of 5.69 for liver cancer, but with
only 5 liver cancers the corresponding 95% CI was very
wide. In addition, any study, including ours, may be subject to confounding. Indeed, the current study considered
only age, race, and calendar time (and smoking for lung
cancer) as potential confounders. Accrual of additional
follow-up and further detailed cancer-specific analyses
that incorporate important cancer-specific risk factors are
needed to determine whether HIV infection is etiologically important in the development of these cancers.
This study has important strengths and limitations.
A particular strength was the inclusion of an internal
HIV-uninfected comparison group. Studies that restrict
the comparison of cancer incidence among HIV-infected
individuals to an external population are particularly subject to inherent differences between the study population
and the external comparison group. Although those

Cancer

December 1, 2010

Cancer Incidence in the MACS: 1984 to 2007/Seaberg et al

designs are important and useful given the relative infrequency of many cancers among HIV-infected individuals,
more accurate risk estimates can be obtained from studies
with an internal comparison group and individual-level
risk factor data, such as those from an earlier MACS analysis of anal cancer.25
An additional strength of the current study, a long
follow-up period with >10 years during both the preHAART and HAART eras, allowed us to assess cancer
incidence trends before and after the introduction of
HAART. Consequently, we had sufficient data with
which to determine that, although the incidence rates of
both KS and NHL declined significantly after the introduction of HAART, a significant excess burden of both
ADMs remains among HIV-infected men in the current
HAART era.
One limitation of the current study was that we
observed only a small number of many cancers and thus
had limited statistical power with which to detect an association between those cancers and HIV infection. This limitation might be related to the finding of significantly
fewer cancers overall among HIV-uninfected men than
were expected according to the SEER data. Possible
explanations for this observation include cancer underascertainment, or that MACS participants had generally
low risk for most cancers. Indeed, MACS participants,
particularly those enrolled before 2001, are highly educated and affluent, and these 2 characteristics have been
linked to a lower cancer risk.37 In addition, MACS participants willingly enrolled into this study in which they
were repeatedly asked about their health and lifestyles;
this selection process may have resulted in a cohort of men
at lower risk for cancer than the general population. A second limitation is that the MACS cohort was limited to
mostly Caucasian MSM. Although we cannot generalize
our results to women or to other racial and HIV risk
groups, our findings regarding ADMs before versus during the HAART era are consistent with those from
another study performed in a largely minority cohort of
women in the United States.38 Finally, with the exception
of smoking, we did not account for other etiologically important cancer-specific risk factors, including coinfection
with oncogenic viruses (eg, HPV, hepatitis C virus, KS
herpesvirus), which will be considered in future analyses.
Given the continued excess cancer risk among individuals infected with HIV in the HAART era, appropriate
screening programs need to be considered for HIVinfected MSM. Specifically, screening for anal squamous
intraepithelial lesions among MSM has been shown to be

Cancer

cost-effective39 and should be offered to this population.
We also observed a nonsignificantly elevated incidence of
liver cancer among HIV-infected men, suggesting that
vaccination should be offered to those at risk for becoming infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), and that
HBV-active HAART regimens should be considered for
HIV/HBV coinfected individuals. Based on our data indicating that HIV-infection was not associated with the
incidence of other cancers for which screening programs
exist, the current American Cancer Society screening
guidelines for other cancers should be applied to all MSM
regardless of HIV status.
