ABSTRACT
5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine are clinically used to treat patients
with blood neoplasia. Their antileukemic property is mediated by the trapping and
the subsequent degradation of a family of proteins, the DNA methyltransferases
(DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) leading to DNA demethylation, tumor suppressor
gene re-expression and DNA damage. Here we studied the respective role of each
DNMT in the human leukemia KG1 cell line using a RNA interference approach. In
addition we addressed the role of DNA damage formation in DNA demethylation by
5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. Our data show that DNMT1 is the main DNMT involved in DNA
methylation maintenance in KG1 cells and in mediating DNA damage formation upon
exposure to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. Moreover, KG1 cells express the DNMT1 protein
at a level above the one required to ensure DNA methylation maintenance, and we
identified a threshold for DNMT1 depletion that needs to be exceeded to achieve DNA
demethylation. Most interestingly, by combining DNMT1 siRNA and treatment with
low dose of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, it is possible to uncouple DNA damage formation
from DNA demethylation. This work strongly suggests that a direct pharmacological
inhibition of DNMT1, unlike the use of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, should lead to tumor
suppressor gene hypomethylation and re-expression without inducing major DNA
damage in leukemia.

DNA rearrangement, while in the promoters of tumor
suppressor genes (TSG) the CpG grouped in structures
called CpG islands (CGIs) are mostly unmethylated.
But in many cancer cells, bulk DNA becomes largely
unmethylated, allowing for the re-expression of embedded
sequences associated with genomic instability. At the same
time promoters of many TSG become hypermethylated,
associated with the silencing of the corresponding genes
[3]. Such deregulation has been used to identify and

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, epigenetic modifications in cancer
have been largely investigated and have successfully led
to the development of novel anticancer therapies aimed
at reversing aberrant modification patterns, among which
DNA methylation at cytosines in CpG dinucleotides is
probably the best studied [1, 2]. In normal cells, these
CpG are generally methylated, protecting the cells from

cancer cells [25]. In breast cancer cells, Chick and coll.
demonstrated that the concomitant downregulation of
DNMT1/3A/3B proteins lead to inhibition of cell growth
and DNA hypomethylation associated with gene reexpression [26]. Interestingly, DAC leads to a different
gene expression pattern compared to the siRNA-mediated
depletion of all three DNMTs, suggesting potential
additional targets for DAC-mediated phenotypes. Thus,
despite a consistent number of studies, the importance
of each DNMT for cancer maintenance still needs to be
clarified. Noteworthy, it seems to depend on the cancer
type, and, since all these data come from solid tumors,
when FDA-approved demethylating agents are used in
MDS and AML, we chose to explore the role of each
DNMT in this pathology. To the best of our knowledge,
concerning hematological cancers, the recent work
from Peters and coll. is unique in relating the oncogenic
potential of DNMT1 in a mouse model of MYC-induced
T-cell lymphoma [27]. Here we addressed the role of each
DNMT on the DNA hypermethylation and gene repression
of TSG in the human AML KG1 model cell line, by using
the RNA interference approach and compared it to the
effect induced by DAC.
Our data show that (i) DNMT1 is the main
methyltransferase involved in the maintenance of global
and TSG promoter-specific (TP73, CDH1 and CDKN2B)
DNA hypermethylation in KG1 cells; (ii) DNA damage
formation can be dissociated from DNA demethylation
activity in cells exposed to DAC; (iii) KG1 cells express
DNMT1 protein at a level largely superior to the one
required to ensure DNA methylation maintenance; (iv)
a threshold must be bypassed in order to trigger global
DNA hypomethylation and specific DNA demethylation
of tumor suppressor genes, and (v) TP73 mRNA
re-expression by DAC requires, in addition to
demethylation of its promoter, another molecular event,
potentially DNA damage.

develop DNA methylation inhibitors, among which two
“epidrugs” have been approved to treat myelodysplasic
syndromes (MDS), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and
Chronic MyeloMonocytic Leukemia (CMML), namely
5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Dacogen®, hereafter named
DAC) and 5-aza-2′cytidine (Vidaza™) [4–7]. These
cytosine analogs target a family of proteins, called DNA
Methyltransferases or DNMTs, responsible for the transfer
of a methyl group onto a cytosine in the context of a CpG
dinucleotide. But their chemical instability translates
into poor pharmacokinetics properties in human, and a
more stable analogue, i.e. SGI-110, is presently being
evaluated in clinical trials, both for blood and solid tumors
[8–10]. Regarding their molecular mechanism of action,
these nucleoside analogs incorporate into DNA, act as
cytosine decoy and trap irreversibly the various DNMTs,
inducing their proteasome-dependent degradation [11–14].
This loss of the DNMT enzymes then leads to passive
demethylation of silenced TSGs associated with their reexpression, ultimately leading to cell growth arrest and
cell death. Moreover, the formation of DNMT adducts in
DAC-enriched DNA was shown to generate DNA damage
in various solid cancer cell lines, and particularly DNA
breaks inducing γH2AX phosphorylation [15–18]. Such
lesions can contribute to active DNA demethylation
through excision of methylated cytosines (mC) from the
DNA, which are subsequently repaired and replaced by
unmethylated cytosines, in addition to inducing cell cycle
arrest in the G2/M phases and loss of viability. These
mechanisms are not selective for a specific DNMT, but
rather involve all DNMTs acting on DNA.
Among the DNMTs, DNMT1 is normally
referred to as the methylation maintenance enzyme,
mainly ensuring the faithful transmission of the CpG
methylation patterns from the parent to the daughter
cells upon division. DNMT3A and 3B are involved in de
novo methylation, particularly during development [19].
Nevertheless some reports suggest that DNMT3B could
play a role in methylation maintenance as well [20, 21].
Still the respective role of each DNMT in promoting
and maintaining the oncogenic transformation is largely
unknown. Several articles have reported the use of RNA
interference or knockout approaches to address the relative
importance of each DNMT on DNA methylation, gene
expression and cell proliferation, but essentially in solid
tumors. For instance, the knockout of DNMT1 or DNMT3B
alone in the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 does
not impact DNA methylation, while their concomitant
invalidation induces profound hypomethylation leading
to a minimal methylation footprint on DNA [22, 23]. In
the same cell line, Robert and coll. found that DNMT1
depletion by siRNA induces CDKN2A demethylation
[24], while another group using the same approach in the
same cell line did not observe any demethylation of this
gene [21]. DNMT3B was also shown to be required for
the maintenance of DNA hypermethylation in cervical

RESULTS
SiRNA-mediated downregulation of each
DNMT (DNMT1, 3A, and 3B) or concomitantly
of the three together does not induce DNA
demethylation, unlike the DNA demethylating
agent DAC
First, the expression levels of DNMT1, 3A and 3B
and their variant types were assessed in three blood cancer
model cell lines, namely KG1, HL60 and Karpas299.
All three DNMTs are expressed at the mRNA level
(Supplementary Figure S1). However, only KG1 expresses
relatively high levels of all DNMTs and especially of
DNMT3B, compared to the other cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S1 and Table S1). In particular, KG1 cells mainly
express variant 6 of DNMT3B and several mRNA variants
of DNMT3A (Supplementary Table S1). Because KG1

expresses all three DNMTs at high levels and it is known
to possess several hypermethylated TSG promoters, we
chose it as in vitro human leukemia model to address the
respective role of each DNMT in the maintenance of DNA
methylation homeostasis.
Second, each DNMT was downregulated by RNA
interference (siRNA) and DAC was used as the reference
DNA demethylating agent. Each designed siRNA depleted
its corresponding DNMT - although to a different extent without significantly affecting the expression of the other
proteins (Supplementary Figure S2). When the three
siRNAs were combined together, DNMT1/3A/3B were all
depleted to similar levels, with mean residual percentage
amounts of 45% (±17%), 57% (±16%), and 17% (±10%)
for DNMT1, 3A and 3B, respectively (Figure 1a).
Upon treatment with 100 nM DAC daily during 3 days,
DNMT1, 3A, and 3B proteins were depleted down to
20% (±17%), 39% (±9%) and 43% (±12%), respectively.
Noteworthy, the low dose of 10 nM DAC efficiently
depleted each DNMT down to 30% (±13%), 47% (±19%)
and 65% (±23%) for DNMT1, 3A and 3B respectively.
The depletion induced by the siRNAs was slightly weaker
compared to that induced by DAC for DNMT1 and
DNMT3A but stronger for DNMT3B. Next we addressed
the impact of these treatments on global DNA methylation
(Figure 1b) and observed that DAC induced a significant
DNA demethylation, while the downregulation by siRNA
of either DNMT1, DNMT3A or DNMT3B individually
or together did not affect significantly DNA methylation
(Figure 1b, and data not shown for individual siRNA).
Interestingly, the lowest dose used of DAC, 10 nM,
hardly affected the level of global DNA methylation,
although depleting already strongly the DNMTs. The
impact of these DNMT depletion on the methylation of
the promoters of three TSGs, TP73, CDKN2B, and CDH1,
was investigated using Methyl-Specific High Resolution
Melting (MS-HRM). As for global DNA methylation,
DAC induced a dose-dependent demethylation of all
three promoters, while siRNA-mediated depletion of the
DNMTs did not show any significant effect (Figure 1c
and Supplementary Figure S3 for CDH1 and CDKN2B).
Since three days of DNMT downregulation were not
sufficient to observe an impact on DNA methylation, we
double-transfected the siRNAs to increase the efficiency
and duration of DNMT depletion. Only siRNAs targeting
DNMT1 and 3B were used since they were more efficient
than DNMT3A siRNA. Despite this longer downregulation
period, promoter methylation of the three TSG was not
affected, in contrast to DAC that led to a significant
demethylation 72 h post-treatment and up to 4 days
after discontinuing the DAC treatment (Supplementary
Figure S4). Since it has been shown in the human colon
cancer cell line HCT116 that downregulation of DNMT1
by siRNA induced a demethylation of the promoter of
CDKN2A [24], we tested in HCT116 the same DNMT1

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

siRNA that we used in KG1. In this solid tumor cell
line, a strong depletion of the DNMT1 protein was
obtained (> 95%) similar to that obtained with 30 nM and
higher concentrations of DAC (Figure 2a). This strong
depletion induced a significant demethylation of the
TP73 promoter (Figure 2b) and of the CDKN2A, IRF8
and RASSF1A promoters (data not shown), in agreement
with the previous results. In addition, the strong depletion
of the DNMT1 protein by the siRNA induced also a
global demethylation at the LINE-1 repeated elements.
Interestingly, lower doses of DNMT1 siRNA that
induced a partial (40%) depletion of the protein had no
global demethylating effect (Supplementary Figure S5).
Consequently, we hypothesized that the partial siRNAdependent DNMT downregulation (55% for DNMT1,
43% for DNMT3A and 83% for DNMT3B proteins)
observed in KG1 may be the limiting factor for an efficient
promoter demethylation. To explore this hypothesis and
increase the depletion of DNMT, we combined the siRNA
approach with 10 nM of DAC, a dose inducing depletion
of all three DNMT, but without a marked impact on DNA
methylation (Figure 1).

Combining DNMT1 siRNA and DAC treatment
increases DNMT1 depletion and induces global
DNA demethylation
The combination of siRNAs targeting each DNMT
with 10 nM DAC increased the level of DNMT1 depletion
(> 95%), but not of DNMT3A and 3B depletion (Figure 3a
and data not shown). Noteworthy, the control siRNA (Luc)
had no modifying effect on the DNMT level, either used
alone or combined with the increasing doses of DAC. We
thus pursued our investigations with the DNMT1 siRNA
combined with DAC and used two different siRNAs,
namely 1(6) and 1(7), targeting distant regions on the
DNMT1 mRNA sequence (see Materials and Methods).
Both siRNAs alone induced similar depletion of the
protein (Figure 3a), namely around 73–86%, and more
than 95% when combined with 10 or 100 nM of DAC
(Figure 3a). Then the impact of this DNMT1 depletion
on global DNA methylation was measured. As shown in
Figure 3b, combining DNMT1 siRNA (1(6) or 1(7)) with
10 nM DAC induced a significant demethylation, similar
to that induced by higher doses of DAC alone, 30 and 100
nM (Figure 3b). This was not observed with the siRNAs
against DNMT3A and 3B (data not shown). This synergy
was increased in combination with 100 nM DAC. These
results were confirmed by bisulfite conversion followed by
pyrosequencing of the LINE-1 and AluSc highly repeated
sequences used as surrogate markers for global DNA
methylation (Figure 3c and 3d). Thus an increase in the
depletion of DNMT1 by combining the siRNA approach
and low doses of DAC is able to demethylate DNA in
KG1 cells. Since previous works suggested a potential

role of DAC-induced DNA damage in the demethylation
process [28], we explored the effect on DNA methylation
of etoposide, a well-know DNA topoisomerase II poison
leading to DNA breaks. Unlike DAC this compound
was unable to induce any global DNA demethylation
(Figure 3b). We then addressed whether this combination
of treatments was able to demethylate specific TSG
promoters and induce their re-expression.

same concentration (Figure 4d). Finally, etoposide induced
TP73 mRNA expression without having any impact on the
methylation of the promoter, suggesting that DNA damage
can induce TP73 mRNA expression. Due to their very low
expression level, CDH1 and CDKN2B re-expression were
not followed (data not shown).

SiRNA-mediated DNMT1 depletion reverts the
γH2AX phosphorylation and G2/M blockade
induced by 100 nM DAC

Combining DNMT1 siRNA and DAC induces
TP73 promoter demethylation associated with
gene re-expression

Next we investigated the role of DNA damage
induced by DAC at high doses, since etoposide, a
DNA damaging agent, induced TP73 re-expression and
another mechanism than DNA demethylation seemed
to be involved in TP73 re-expression induced by DAC.
The phosphorylation of γH2AX, a histone variant
induced by DNA damage, was analyzed upon treatment
of KG1 cells (Figure 5a). DAC alone induced a dosedependent increase in the percentage of cells expressing
phosphorylated γH2AX with 20% positive cells at 100
nM. Etoposide was used as positive control (57% positive
cells at 5 μM), as it induces DNA double-stranded breaks
through the formation of topoisomerase II-DNA covalent
complexes, similar to the DNMT-DNA adducts formed
upon exposure to DAC [13, 31, 32]. Both DNMT1 siRNAs
did not induce any significant phospho-γH2AX signal
(Figure 5a). Interestingly, the combination of DNMT1
siRNAs and 100 nM DAC strongly reduced the percentage
of γH2AX phosphorylated positive cells (from 25% to less
than 5%). Similarly, previously published data showed
that knocking down topoisomerase II is associated with
a reduced level of DNA damage induced by doxorubicin
and etoposide [33, 34]. This is the result of a reduced
formation of covalent adducts involving topoisomerase II,
DNA, and the aforementioned topoisomerase II inhibitors.
We then explored the consequences of the modulation of
γH2AX phosphorylation on the cell cycle. In agreement
with previous reports [16–18, 35], DAC induced a G2/M
arrest in response to the activation of the G2/M checkpoint
triggered by DNA damage (Figure 5b). Clearly, the
DNMT1 siRNAs reverted the G2/M blockade induced
by 100 nM DAC (Figure 5b, and Supplementary Figure
S9 for a focus on G0/G1 and G2/M phases). Finally, the
impact on KG1 cell growth was explored. Since DAC
is known to induce a delayed effect on cell proliferation
[36], the cell viability was measured seven days after the
first treatment (Figure 5c). As expected, DAC induced
a dose-dependent loss of cell viability of 50% and 90%
at 30 nM and 100 nM, respectively. Although clearly
reversing γH2AX phosphorylation and G2/M blockade,
siRNA-mediated downregulation of DNMT1 did not
protect the cells from the loss of viability measured
seven days after exposure to repeated DAC treatments
(Figure 5c).

As previously reported [29, 30], the promoter
regions of three TSGs, namely TP73, CDH1 and
CDKN2B, are hypermethylated in KG1 cells (Figure 4 and
Supplementary Figure S4). As expected, a dose range of
DAC induced, after 72 h of daily treatment, a significant
demethylation of all three genes, with 30 nM as the first
significantly effective dose and achieving a stronger
demethylation at 100 nM (Figure 4). In agreement with
our observations on global DNA methylation, etoposide
was unable to induce demethylation of the three promoters
(Figure 4). Interestingly, the combined treatment of
DNMT1 siRNA with the demethylation-inactive dose of 10
nM DAC induced a strong and significant demethylation
of all three TSGs, equivalent to higher doses of DAC alone
(Figure 4). These results were obtained with both siRNAs
against DNMT1. To further confirm these observations,
promoter DNA methylation was analyzed by bisulfite
conversion followed by pyrosequencing (Supplementary
Figure S7), confirming the data obtained by MS-HRM.
Noteworthy, in the case of TP73, pyrosequencing did not
only confirm the demethylation activities seen by MSHRM, but also assessed the impact of the combination
on the methylation of the second promoter (P2) described
for this gene (Supplementary Figure S8). Thus an
extensive depletion of DNMT1 in KG1 cells, obtained
by combining siRNA and DAC at low dose, induced
global DNA demethylation and specific TSG promoter
demethylation, among them TP73. This prompted us to
study whether this demethylation affected TP73 mRNA
expression. DAC alone restored TP73 expression in a
dose-dependent manner 72 h after treatment as measured
by qRT-PCR (Figure 4d). DNMT1 siRNAs alone showed
no effect, while when combined with 10 nM DAC, a
modest but significant induction of TP73 mRNA was
measured (Figure 4d). Interestingly, even if the extent
of DNA demethylation was equivalent, the extent of
re-expression was lower (two-fold change) than with
DAC alone at higher concentration (eight-fold change),
implying that another mechanism induced by DAC is
involved. Unexpectedly, when combined with 100 nM
DAC, the siRNAs (luc and DNMT1) suppressed partially
TP73 gene re-expression induced by DAC alone at the

A genome wide analysis of DNA methylation
changes at 450 000 CpGs induced by the
combination of DNMT1 siRNA and DAC

DAC (Figure 7b), in the siRNA treated cells all residual
DNMT1 is mobilized to ensure DNA methylation
(Figure 7b). This explains why the siDNMT1 are unable
to demethylate DNA in KG1 cells. In agreement with this
hypothesis Patel and coll. showed that in DAC treated
cells the formation of cytosine adducts are more critical
for DNA demethylation than the residual level of DNMT1
[38]. Second, in the case of DNMT1 siRNA combined
with a low dose of DAC, the free available pool of protein
drops below the minimally required amount and induces
DNA demethylaton, but with reduced DNA damage
(Figure 7d) compared with 100 nM DAC (Figure 7c).
This combined treatment allows then to reveal the passive
demethylation component of DAC, in contrast to the active
demethylation involving the formation of DNA damage.
Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
low dose of DAC used (10 nM) in combination with
DNMT1 siRNA could participate in a more active manner
than just lowering the level of DNMT1 available for DNA
methylation. In conclusion, this study reveals an essential
role of DNMT1 in maintaining DNA hypermethylation in
KG1 cells, in contrast to DNMT3B, which is abundant
in KG1. Regarding DNMT3A, its expression is already
low in KG1 cells. It is also possible that DNMT3A and/or
DNMT3B play other roles in addition to DNA methylation
management, since Hagemann and coll. recently reported
that DNMT3B depletion in human colon cancer cells
induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis without changes
in their DNA methylation pattern [39].
Concerning the role of DNA damage in DNA
demethylation, it has been suggested that formation of the
suicide complex between incorporated DAC and DNMT
participates to DNA demethylation through a DNA repair
mechanism, a process referred to active demethylation
[28]. Here we clearly separated DNA damage formation
and DNA demethylation by combining DNMT1 siRNA
and low doses of DAC, since this combination induced
DNA demethylation with lower DNA damage compared to
DAC alone at 30 nM or 100 nM. Interestingly, two recent
studies showed that depleting either DNMT1 or DNMT3B
in cancer cells protects them from gene misregulation
and cell cycle arrest induced by a DAC treatment, hence
supporting our present findings [14, 15]. Accordingly, the
suppressive effect of DNMT1 siRNA on DAC-mediated
TP73 mRNA induction that we observed could well be
explained by a significant reduction of DNA damage,
through lowering the DNMT1-DNA adduct formation
that would participate, at least in part, in the gene
re-expression.
Another main conclusion is that the antiproliferative
effect of DAC does not seem to be associated with its
ability to induce DNA breaks. Indeed, the DNMT1 siRNAs
combined with low doses of DAC, which induced the
same DNA demethylation as high DAC doses but with
lower DNA damage, had the same cell viability inhibition
at 7 days as DAC at high doses. This result suggests that

Next, the effect of the combination of the siRNA
against DNMT1 with a low dose of DAC was explored
at the genome-wide level using the Illumina 450K CpG
BeadChips. Unsupervised clustering analysis confirmed
that cells treated with the high concentration of 100 nM
DAC sustain similar methylation changes than those
treated with the low dose of DAC (10 nM) combined with
the DNMT1 siRNA (group 1 in Figure 6a). Non-treated
cells, cells treated with low concentration of DAC and
cells transfected with DNMT1 siRNA alone clustered
together in group 2 (Figure 6a). Since it is known that
DNA methylation of promoters has a direct role in genes
transcription, we focused our analysis on the genes for
which the modulated CpG are located within, or in a close
vicinity, of their corresponding transcription start site
(TSS). We identified 689 hypomethylated genes in group
1, including CDKN2B, in agreement with our MS-HRM
and pyrosequencing data. Most surprisingly, we observed
also that 1 254 genes were hypermethylated in this same
group 1 (Supplementary Table S2 and S3 for the lists of
hypo- and hypermethylated genes, respectively). Next,
we analyzed the pathways that were mostly affected by
hypomethylation changes in group 1, using the Ingenuity
Analysis Pathway® (IPA®) tool. The most significantly
affected pathways (i.e., with the lower p-values, -log(pvalue) > 2) concerned major cell signaling pathways
that share several common factors with NF-kB network
(Figure 6b, genes in bold in the table). This observation
suggested that main apoptosis/proliferation functions are
affected by hypomethylation following DNMT1 strong
depletion (100 nM DAC or 10 nM DAC combined with
siDNMT1).

DISCUSSION
Our data show that all three DNMT1/3A/3B are
expressed in KG1 cells, with DNMT1 and 3B being
predominant. This is in agreement with previous data on
CD34+ leukemia cell lines, such as KG1, showing high
expression of DNMT3B [37]. Surprisingly, partial DNMT
downregulation by siRNA in KG1 cells (60 to 90%) did
not induce any global or specific DNA demethylation,
in contrast to what has been observed in HCT116 cells,
where we could achieve a DNMT1 depletion > 95%. To
explain these apparent discrepancies, we suggest that KG1
cells express high levels of the three DNMT1/3A/3B, and
particularly of DNMT1, which exceeds the minimum
amount required to maintain CpG methylation (Figure 7).
This minimal amount defines the threshold, below which
DNA demethylation is observed (Figure 7a). First, while
in 10 nM DAC co-treated cells the DNMT1 that is not
depleted can be trapped on the DNA by the incorporated

Figure 7: Schematic representation of the DNMT1 threshold hypothesis for DNA methylation maintenance. (a) In KG1

cells the physiological level of DNMT1 is largely above the minimum amount to ensure proper DNA methylation propagation, defining
a reservoir of protein (yellow). (b) The partial loss of DNMT1, either by a low dose of DAC (10 nM) or a siRNA specific to DNMT1,
reduces the DNMT1 content, but the remaining free pool (green + yellow) is sufficient to maintain the CpG methylation, even though a
small proportion of detected DNMT1 can be trapped by the DAC incorporated into DNA (red), leading to few DNA breaks, which is not
the case for the siRNA. (c) A higher dose of DAC (100 nM) strongly lowers the free DNMT1 pool below the critical threshold, triggering
global and specific DNA demethylation. At the same time, DNMT1-DAC adducts formed on DNA translate into DNA breaks visualized by
γH2AX phosphorylation. (d) Depletion of the DNMT1 pool, below the threshold, can also be achieved by combining a low dose of DAC
with a siRNA directed against DNMT1. Similar to a high dose of DAC (i.e. 100 nM) this combination induces a global and gene-specific
DNA demethylation, but little DNA damage, since less DAC and also less DNMT1, downregulated by the siRNA, are present to form the
DNMT-DNA adducts and consequent DNA damage.
Yellow box: Reservoir of DNMT1 not required to maintain DNA methylation
Green box: Pool of DNMT1 required to ensure DNA methylation maintenance
Red box: Pool of DNMT1 that can be trapped on DNA by DAC and be converted into DNA damage
DNMT1 threshold = defines the minimal pool of DNMT1 required for DNA methylation maintenance

to the controls, 10 nM DAC or DNMT1 siRNA alone.
Interestingly, in parallel to a general hypomethylating
activity, we observed promoter hypermethylation of
certain genes. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that
different cell populations are present in the bulk and
behave differently. The analysis of the pathways that
are hypomethylated in the treated KG1 cells compared
to the non-treated converges on genes related to several
cell signaling pathways as targets of the combination
of DAC and DNMT1 siRNA (Figure 6). The NF-kB
network (i.e. FADD, TRAF2, RIPK1, PIK3R1, NFKBIE
and CHUK, in bold in Figure 6b) is clearly affected and
may be involved in the antiproliferative activity of this
combination.

the induced DNA demethylation plays an important role
in affecting cell growth, possibly by the re-expression
of TSGs, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest and cell
death. We thus succeeded in turning the initial drawback
of a partial DNMT1 depletion by siRNA in KG1 cells into
an advantage by combining this approach with low dose
of DAC, giving insights into the mechanism of action of
DAC and one of its main targets, DNMT1.
To further compare the effect of the downregulation
of DNMT1 by DAC or by the combination of siRNA
and non-demethylating doses of DAC, we performed
a microarray analysis to explore the methylation
changes in the genome. Again the two treatments that
strongly depleted DNMT1 clustered together compared

Finally, two recent articles report the successful
TSG induction in cancer cells by combining DAC with
the inhibition of two other epigenetic modifiers, HDAC
and LSD1 [40, 41]. These data combined with our present
results support the rationale to test, in leukemia models, the
combined treatment of DNMT1 selective inhibitors with
already approved “epidrugs”, such as HDAC inhibitors,
or preclinically investigated molecules such as LSD1
inhibitors. Importantly, our data suggest that combining
low doses of DAC with a DNMT1 selective inhibitor could
achieve an efficient TSGs hypomethylation associated with
a reduced impact on DNA damage and potentially reduce
the side effects observed with high doses of DAC.

siRNA delivery
In the case of KG1, the 4D-Nucleofector™ System
(Lonza) was used to vector one or several siRNAs. In a
typical experiment, 8x106 actively growing KG1 cells
were transfected in 100 μL SF solution with 100 nM
(DNMT1) or 300 nM (DNMT3A or 3B) siRNA according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Corresponding
concentrations of luciferase siRNA were used as
negative controls. Immediately after electroporation
cells were collected in 5 mL fresh medium and incubated
for the indicated time periods. The GFP-expressing
vector pmaxGFP from Lonza was used to assess the
transfection efficiency by flow cytometry 24 h posttreatment. Usually 70 to 80% cells expressed GFP. For
HCT116, Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX Transfection
Reagent from Invitrogen (by Life Technologies) was
used to deliver DNMT1 or luciferase siRNA to the cells.
Briefly, a premix of 10 μL siRNA (diluted in water to
ensure final concentrations of 10, 20 and 40 nM) with
485 μL OptiMEM (Invitrogen by Life Technologies)
and 5 μL transfection reagent was incubated for 25 min.
250 μL of this suspension was mixed with 1.5 × 105
cells and seeded in a 6 well plate. After the indicated
period of time the cells were trypsinized for further
analysis. Sequences of siRNAs used to target DNMTs:

procedure described by UK Leammli [43]. Briefly, 48
h after siRNA transfection or DAC exposure, 20 μg
total protein were loaded onto 8% polyacrylamide gel,
separated through electrophoresis, transferred onto
PVDF membrane, and incubated with the following
primary antibodies, at the indicated dilutions: mouse antipan-actin 1:40 000 (MAB1501, Millipore, USA), rabbit
anti-DNMT1 1:10 000 (NB100–264, Novus Biologicals,

HRP-coupled antibodies from Sigma Aldrich. All the
incubation steps were performed in the following buffer:
200 mM NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl pH7.6, 0.1% Tween 20.
The Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate
from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany) was used
to reveal the protein luminescent signals acquired on

to normalize the protein loading variations. The relative

The analysis of the total 5-methylcytosine (5mC)
content in cells was performed according to the method
described in Desjobert et al. [44]. Briefly, the cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and
then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. After
treatment with HCl 2N (30 min, 37°C) and neutralization
with Tris HCl 100 mM pH 8.8, the cells were incubated
in a blocking solution (1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 in
PBS). The 5mC labelling was performed with a primary
monoclonal antibody against 5mC (clone 33D3, AbD
Serotec by Biorad) and an Alexa-Fluor® 647-conjugated
goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody (Invitrogen by
Life Technologies). Cells were finally labelled in 5 μg/mL
propidium iodide (PI) in PBS. All steps were performed at
room temperature except when indicated.
The 5mC labelling was analyzed on a LSRII
cytometer (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France)
using the BD FACSDiva software. After gating the cells
according to their propidium iodide content in order to
exclude debris, cell-doublets, aggregates or apoptotic cells,
the means of fluorescence intensities (mfi) were recorded
on at least 5000 cells. The 5mC mfis were reported to the

The PCR reactions were performed as duplicates in
a final volume of 15 μL on 70 ng of bisulfite converted
DNA as follows: 2 min at 95°C to activate the “hot start”
enzyme and 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 sec and 58°C for
30 sec; followed by a high resolution fusion curve from
65°C to 90°C (0.2°C step climb every 10sec) to determine
the specific Tm of each amplicon. Hypomethylation will
translate into a lower Tm due to the transformation of
unmethylated cytosines into uracils and thymidines after
PCR. The MS-HRM PCR efficiency was higher than
90%. Data analyses were performed using the Precision
Melt Analysis software (Bio-Rad). The melting curve of
unmethylated control DNA was subtracted from the melting

cluster variance using squared Euclidean distances. The
differentially methylated genes between Group1 and
Group2 were analysed by the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis®
tool according to the number of deregulated CpG sites in
the genes TSS. The most enriched canonical pathways
were considered significant with a threshold p-value < 0.01.
The value of ratio is calculated by dividing the number of
deregulated genes in a specific pathway by the total number
of genes that constitute this pathway. All the data generated
in this genome-wide analysis come from three biological
independent experiments for each control and treatment
analyzed.

Seventy-two hours after treatment, 5 × 105 cells
were collected, fixed and permeabilized with DNA Prep
LPR (6607055, Beckman Coulter), incubated with an
Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-γH2AX phosphorylated
(Ser139) antibody from Biolegend (613408, London,
United Kingdom) at a 1:150 dilution in PBS 1% BSA
for 45 min. Cells were then washed with PBS 1% BSA,
and incubated for 60 min with DNA Prep Stain solution
(Beckman Coulter) to stain the DNA. Cells were then
analyzed with a Becton Dickinson LSRII flow cytometer.
ModFit LT™ 3.0 software was used to analyze the
repartition of the cells along cell cycle phases, i.e., G0/G1,
S and G2/M. For the γH2AX phosphorylation analysis,
cells incubated with vehicle, or electroporated with the
control siRNA, were used to define a fluorescent threshold
for cells expressing the phosphorylated form of γH2AX.

Statistical analysis
A minimum of two biologically independent
experiments were performed to generate mean values +/–
standard deviation (SD). In the case of global methylation
measurement through flow cytometry, cell cycle analysis,
and γH2AX phosphorylation, a minimum of 4 replicates
were compiled due to the small variations between the
various treatments. For the p-value calculations, and
since more than two conditions had to be compared, one
way ANOVA associated with the contrast method was
used (SAS R9.3). One star * refers to a p-value ≤ 0.05,
** ≤ 0.01 and *** ≤ 0.001. In the case of MS-HRM, the
p-values were obtained from Tukey’s post-hoc comparisons.

Cell survival
Briefly, 2x105 KG1 cells, previously treated for 72
h with either various doses of DAC, DNMT1 siRNAs or
both, were seeded in 6 well plates. 96 h later cell viability
was assessed via the Trypan Blue (Sigma Aldrich)
exclusion method using a CellometerTM from Ozyme (St
Quentin Yvelines, France).

DNA quantitation was measured using the QuantiTTMdsDNA Broad-Range Assay Kit (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. 1 μg of
DNA was bisulfite-converted using the EpiTect Bisulfite
Conversion Kit (Qiagen). The Infinium® 450K Methylation
BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used
for genome-wide methylation analysis. The experimental
protocol was followed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using 200 ng DNA of each bisulfite-converted
sample. Bead Chips were scanned using the Illumina®
iScan system. The methylation level of each CpG site was
calculated as the methylation beta value using the intensities
between methylated and unmethylated probes (β-value
= Methylated probe intensity (M) / (Unmethylated probe
intensity (U) + Methylated probe intensity (M) + 100) as
defined by Illumina. Data were extracted using the Genome
Studio software version 2011.1, Methylation module
version 1.9.0 (Illumina Inc.) without any normalization
steps. As quality control, Infinium I/II shift correction and
data normalization was performed using a refined version
of an in-house developed pipeline based on subset quantile
normalization [45]. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
