Abstract
Silibinin, a flavonoid isolated from Silybum marianum, has
been reported to have cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic effects. Here, we show that treatment with subtoxic doses of
silibinin in combination with tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces rapid apoptosis in
TRAIL-resistant glioma cells, but not in human astrocytes,
suggesting that this combined treatment may offer an
attractive strategy for safely treating gliomas. Although the
proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 by TRAIL was partially
blocked in glioma cells, cotreatment with silibinin efficiently
recovered TRAIL-induced caspase activation in these cells.
Silibinin treatment up-regulated DR5, a death receptor of
TRAIL, in a transcription factor CHOP-dependent manner.
Furthermore, treatment with silibinin down-regulated the
protein levels of the antiapoptotic proteins FLIPL, FLIPS, and
survivin through proteasome-mediated degradation. Taken
together, our results show that the activity of silibinin to
modulate multiple components in the death receptor–
mediated apoptotic pathway is responsible for its ability to
recover TRAIL sensitivity in TRAIL-resistant glioma cells.

Introduction
Gliomas account for >50% of all brain tumors and are by far the
most common primary brain tumors in adults (1). Despite the use
of conventional treatments, including surgery, g-irradiation, and
chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of glioma patients after
the initial diagnosis is usually <1 year (2). Thus, the researchers are
currently attempting to develop novel therapeutic strategies for
malignant gliomas.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) is considered to be a potential cancer therapeutic agent
because it is able to induce apoptosis in various cancer cells
without affecting the majority of normal human cells (3, 4).
However, recent studies have shown that many types of cancer
cells, including malignant gliomas, are resistant to the apoptotic
effects of TRAIL (5–7), suggesting that treatment with TRAIL alone

may not be sufficient for the treatment of various malignant tumor
cells. Identification of sensitizers capable of overcoming TRAIL
resistance in cancer cells is needed for the establishment of more
effective TRAIL-based cancer therapies.
Silibinin, a flavonoid present in the widely consumed dietary
supplement milk thistle extract, has shown promising efficacy in
preventing and treating human cancers, including prostate and
skin cancer (8, 9). Silymarin, which is composed mainly of
silibinin, has been accepted for human clinical use in Europe
and Asia for the treatment of liver diseases (10). Silibinin
exhibits pleiotropic anticancer effects via induction of cell cycle
arrest (11) and apoptosis (12) as well as prevention of
angiogenesis (13) and invasion (14), showing that silibinin may
prove useful as an anticancer drug either alone or as an adjunct
in combination therapy. Multiple targets, including cyclindependent kinases (11), p53 (12), vascular endothelial growth
factor (13), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ref. 14),
have been proposed to explain the anticancer effects of silibinin,
but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been
fully elucidated.
Here, we show for the first time that subtoxic doses of silibinin
effectively sensitize glioma cells but not human astrocytes to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that this combined
treatment may provide a safe and effective therapeutic strategy
against malignant gliomas that are resistant to various conventional treatments. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that the
prominent sensitizing effect of silibinin on TRAIL-induced
apoptosis is due to modulation of multiple components in the
death receptor–mediated apoptotic signaling pathway, including
DR5 (a TRAIL receptor), FLIP (an inhibitor of caspase-8), and
survivin (an inhibitor of effector caspases).

Silibinin-Mediated Sensitization of Apoptosis
Cells and culture conditions. The human glioma cells U251MG,
U87MG, A172, and U251N were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (Life Technologies). The primary
cultures of normal human astrocytes were prepared from 14-week-gestation
fetal cerebrum tissues as described previously (15). Human astrocyte
cultures were grown in DMEM with high glucose supplemented with 10%
FBS and 20 Ag/mL gentamicin and subcultured every 2 weeks, and cell
culture passage number less than five was used in the present study.
Immunofluorescence study indicated that >99% of cells expressed glial
fibrillary acidic protein, a cell type–specific marker for astrocytes.
Permission to use human brain tissues for research was granted by the
clinical screening committee involving human subjects of the University.
Measurement of cellular viability. Cell viability was assessed by double
labeling of cells with 2 Amol/L calcein-AM and 4 Amol/L EthD-1. The
calcein-positive cells and Etd-1–positive dead cells were visualized using
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).
Construction of the expression vectors for c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS. The
cDNAs encoding human c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS were PCR amplified from
plasmids (pCA-FLAG-hFLIPL and pCA-FLAG-hFLIPS; kindly provided by
Dr. S.I. Park, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Seoul,
Korea) to contain these sequences with the specific primers. c-FLIPL and
c-FLIPS cDNA fragments were digested with KpnI and XhoI and subcloned
into the pcDNA 3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen), and the resulting constructs were
confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.
Establishment of the stable cell lines overexpressing CrmA, Akt,
survivin, c-FLIPL, or c-FLIPS. U87MG cells were transfected with the
following: a mammalian expression vector containing CrmA cDNA, a vector
containing Myc-tagged active Akt (Upstate Biotechnology), a vector
containing Flag-tagged survivin, and a vector encoding Flag-tagged c-FLIPL
or c-FLIPS. Stable cell lines overexpressing CrmA, active Akt, survivin,
c-FLIPL, or c-FLIPS were selected with fresh medium containing 500 Ag/mL
G418 (Calbiochem). Overexpression of CrmA, active Akt, survivin, c-FLIPL,
or c-FLIPS was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-CrmA (BD
PharMingen), anti-Myc (Covance Research Products), anti-Flag (Sigma), or
anti-c-FLIP (Alexis) antibody, respectively.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from U251MG
cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR) was done following the manufacturer’s protocol (TaKaRa Shuzo Co.
Ltd.). Conditions for final analysis were chosen when amplification of
mRNA was in the middle of the exponential amplification phase for
150 Amol/L silibinin. Human DR5 mRNA was amplified using the sense
primer 5¶-GTCTGCTCTGATCACCCAAC-3¶ and the antisense primer 5¶CTGCAAACTGTGACTCCTATG-3¶ (corresponding to a 424-bp region of
DR5). For CHOP, the sense primer 5¶-CAACTGCAGAGATGGCAGCTGA-3¶
and the antisense primer 5¶-CTGATGCTCCCAATTGTTCAT-3¶ (corresponding to a 536-bp region of CHOP) were used. For glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the sense primer 5¶-CGGCCATCACGCCCACAGTTT-3¶ and the antisense primer 5¶-CGGCCATCACGCCCACAGTTT-3¶ were used (corresponding to a 310-bp region of GAPDH). The
PCR cycling conditions (30 cycles) were chosen as follows: (a) 30 s at 94jC
for GAPDH and DR5, 45 s at 94jC for CHOP; (b) 30 s at 68jC for DR5, 30 s
at 60jC for GAPDH, 45 s at 52.5jC for CHOP; and (c) 1 min and 30 s at
72jC for DR5 and GAPDH, 45 s at 72jC for CHOP, with a subsequent 10-min
extension at 72jC. Reaction products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels.
The bands were visualized by ethidium bromide.
Flow cytometry of death receptors. Cells were analyzed for the surface
expression of DR5 by indirect staining with primary goat anti-human DR5
antibody (R&D Systems) followed by FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG.
Briefly, 5  105 cells were incubated with 200 AL PBS containing saturating
amounts of anti-DR5 antibody on ice for 30 min. As a negative control, cells
were incubated with a goat isotype antibody at the same condition. After
incubation, cells were washed with PBS twice and reacted with FITCconjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG on ice for 30 min. After washing with PBS,
the expressions of these death receptors were analyzed by FACS sorter
(Becton Dickinson and Co.).
Small interfering RNAs. The 25-nucleotide small interfering RNA
(siRNA) duplexes used in this study were purchased from Invitrogen and

have the following sequences: DR5 (F01), UUUAGCCACCUUUAUCUCAUUGUCC; DR5 (E11), UACAAUCACCGACCUUGACCAUCCC; and CHOP,
AAGACCCGCGCCGAGGUGAAG. Cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay. Cells were fixed with fresh 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in
PBS. Then, DNA strand breaks were detected using the APO-BrdU terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay kit (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer’s instructions
and pictures were taken on an inverted fluorescence microscope ( filter set
10: excitation, 450–490 nm bandpass; emission, 515–565 nm bandpass; filter
set 20: excitation, 546/12 nm bandpass; emission, 575–640 nm bandpass;
Zeiss).
Plasmids, transfection, and luciferase assay. The DR5-SacI plasmid
[containing DR5 promoter sequence ( 2,500/+3)] and pDR5-605 [containing DR5 promoter sequence ( 605/+3)] were gifts from Dr. T. Sakai (Kyoto
Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan). Point mutations of the
CHOP-binding sites to the DR5-605 promoter were generated by a two-step
PCR method using the following primers: mCHOP (5¶-CTTGCGGAGGATTGCGTTGACGA-3¶ to 5¶-CTTGCGGAGGAGGTAGTTGACGA-3¶). Clones
representing each point mutation were sequenced to ensure the accuracy of
the PCR amplification procedure. For transfection, in brief, cells were plated
onto 60-mm dish at a density of 5  105 per dish and grown overnight.
Cells were cotransfected with 2 Ag of various plasmid constructs and 0.2 Ag
of the pCMV-h-galactosidase plasmid for 3 h using LipofectAMINE Plus
reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After
incubation for 24 h, transfected cells were further treated with or without
silibinin. Luciferase and h-galactosidase activities were assayed according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). Luciferase activity was
normalized for h-galactosidase activity in cell lysates and expressed as an
average of three independent experiments.
Statistical analysis. All data are presented as mean F SE of at least
three independent experiments. The statistical significance of differences
was assessed using ANOVA (GraphPad software, GraphPad) followed by
Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests. P < 0.05 was considered
significant.

Results
Subtoxic doses of silibinin effectively sensitize TRAILresistant glioma cells, but not normal astrocytes, to TRAILmediated apoptosis. We previously reported that glioma cells
are generally resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (6, 7). Here,
we examined whether silibinin could sensitize various resistant
glioma cells to the apoptotic effects of TRAIL. Treatment of
U251MG, U87MG, A172, and U251N cells with 50 to 100 ng/mL
TRAIL alone or 50 to 150 Amol/L silibinin alone induced a
limited cell death over 24 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast, glioma cell
viability was significantly reduced by combined treatment under
conditions of a fixed TRAIL concentration and varied silibinin
concentrations as well as the reverse. However, combined
treatment with silibinin and TRAIL of various concentrations
had no significant effect on the viability of normal astrocytes
(Fig. 1B). These results suggest that sensitizing regimens using
silibinin and TRAIL together may be preferentially toxic to glioma
cells over normal astrocytes.
Critical role of caspases in apoptosis induced by combined
treatment with silibinin and TRAIL. In U251MG glioma cells
cotreated with silibinin and TRAIL, typical apoptotic morphologies
were observed, including cellular shrinkage, blebbing, and nuclear
fragmentation (Fig. 2A). To examine whether silibinin enhances
TRAIL-mediated cell death via caspase-dependent apoptosis, we
analyzed caspase cleavage in U251MG and U87MG cells treated

with 150 Amol/L silibinin alone, 100 ng/mL TRAIL alone, or
150 Amol/L silibinin plus 100 ng/mL TRAIL. Our results revealed
that treatment with 150 Amol/L silibinin alone did not induce the
proteolytic processing of any caspase in the tested cell lines
(Fig. 2B). In glioma cells treated with TRAIL alone for 24 h, the
32-kDa procaspase-3 was partially cleaved to a 20-kDa intermediate form, but further cleavage into the active p17 and p12 subunit
was not detected. However, combined treatment with silibinin and
TRAIL induced the complete processing of caspase-3 into p17/p12
(Fig. 2B). The precursor protein levels of caspase-8 and caspase-9
were also significantly decreased in cells exposed to combined
treatment with silibinin and TRAIL but not in those treated with
either agent alone. Activation of these caspases by cotreatment
with silibinin and TRAIL was further confirmed by Western blotting

of their substrate proteins. Both FAK, the substrate protein of
caspase-3 (16), and Bid, a substrate protein of caspase-8 (17), were
proteolytically processed in response to the combined treatment
but not in response to either agent alone. We then examined the
importance of caspases in silibinin-sensitized TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk significantly blocked the cell death induced by the combined
treatment (Fig. 2C), as did overexpression of CrmA, a viral inhibitor
of caspase-8 (Fig. 2D; ref. 18). These results suggest that caspases
play a critical role in the apoptosis induced by combined treatment
with silibinin and TRAIL.

to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we first examined whether silibinin
affects the expression levels of the death receptors of TRAIL, DR4
and DR5. A time course experiment to determine the changes in
DR5 protein levels following treatment with 150 Amol/L silibinin
showed that DR5 levels progressively increased up to 16 h and
declined at 24 h in both U251MG and U87MG cells (Fig. 3A). In
contrast, DR4 protein levels were not altered by silibinin treatment.
To confirm whether silibinin-induced DR5 up-regulation is
restricted to particular glioma cell lines, U251N and A172 cells
were treated with 100 or 150 Amol/L silibinin for 16 h and
subjected to Western blot analysis, together with U251MG and
U87MG cells. Dose-dependent elevation of DR5 protein levels was
observed in all the glioma cells tested (Fig. 3B). These results show
that DR5 up-regulation is a common response of various glioma
cells to silibinin. When we examined the changes in DcR1 and
DcR2 protein levels, neither DcR1 nor DcR2 protein levels were
altered by silibinin in U87MG and U251N cells. In contrast, both
DcR1 and DcR2 were too low in U251MG and A172 cells for
detection by Western blotting. These results show that silibinin
selectively up-regulates DR5 among the receptors of TRAIL. Flow
cytometric analysis showed that silibinin treatment slightly
affected the background signal of the goat isotype control antibody.
However, the surface expression of DR5 was further enhanced in
the presence of silibinin. In response to cotreatment with silibinin
plus TRAIL, the surface expression of DR5 was also increased
(Fig. 3C). To clarify the functional role of DR5 up-regulation in
apoptosis induced by combined treatment with silibinin and
TRAIL, we used siRNAs against DR5. Suppression of DR5
expression by transfection of U251MG cells with two kinds of
siRNAs directed against DR5 also significantly blocked the
apoptosis induced by the combined treatment when we did
TUNEL assay (Fig. 3D). These results collectively indicate that DR5
up-regulation is important for silibinin-facilitated TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis. Next, we further investigated the possible upstream
signals responsible for silibinin-induced DR5 up-regulation.
Recently, CHOP/GADD153 was shown to be involved in MG132mediated (19) and tunicamycin-mediated (20) DR5 up-regulation,
contributing to the sensitization of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
We found that the protein levels of CHOP were significantly
increased by silibinin treatment, preceding silibinin-induced DR5
up-regulation (Fig. 4A). RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA
levels of both CHOP and DR5 were dose dependently increased by
silibinin treatment (Fig. 4B). To investigate whether CHOP is
associated with silibinin-mediated transcriptional activation of
DR5, we mutated the potential CHOP site ( 281 to 261) of the
DR5 gene (20). U87MG cells were transfected with pDR-SacI, pDR605, and pDR-605-mCHOP plasmids and treated with or without
silibinin. The DR5-SacI and pDR5-605 plasmid contain DR5
promoter sequence 2,500/+3 and sequence 605/+3, respectively.
pDR5-605-mCHOP plasmid contains the mutation at CHOPbinding sites of the DR5 promoter. Whereas the promoter activities
of pDR5-SacI and pDR5-605 were increased by silibinin in a dosedependent manner, the promoter activity of pDR5-605-mCHOP
was not enhanced by silibinin treatment. Because mutation at the
CHOP-binding site significantly abrogated the activation of the
DR5 promoter by silibinin, these results suggest that CHOP is
involved in the silibinin-mediated up-regulation of DR5 (Fig. 4C).
Furthermore, suppression of CHOP by siRNA knockdown significantly inhibited silibinin-induced DR5 up-regulation, showing
again that CHOP induction is required for silibinin-induced DR5
up-regulation (Fig. 4D). Moreover, we found that siRNA knockdown

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

of CHOP significantly blocked the apoptosis induced by combined
treatment with silibinin and TRAIL. Taken together, these results
suggest that CHOP induction plays a critical role in both silibinininduced DR5 up-regulation and silibinin-facilitated TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.
Down-regulation of c-FLIP and survivin is also involved in
silibinin-facilitated TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We further investigated the possible involvement of various regulators of
apoptotic signaling in silibinin-stimulated TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We first examined whether silibinin affects the protein levels of
caspase inhibitors, such as FLIP, a homologue of caspase-8 that
is recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex, thereby
inhibiting the activation and cleavage of caspase-8 (21), and the
inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP; e.g., XIAP, survivin, and c-IAP),
which suppress apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3, caspase-7,
and/or caspase-9 (22–24). We found that the protein levels of both
FLIPL and FLIPS, the major splice forms of FLIP (21), were downregulated in response to treatment with silibinin alone or silibinin
plus TRAIL (Fig. 5A). Among the tested IAPs, we found that the
protein levels of survivin significantly decreased in response to
treatment with silibinin alone or silibinin plus TRAIL. In addition,
the activity of Akt, an antiapoptotic protein, was decreased by
silibinin alone or silibinin plus TRAIL, suggesting that the silibininmediated down-regulation of these antiapoptotic proteins may play
a role in the enhancement of TRAIL-mediated cell death. In
contrast, the protein levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins,
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, were not affected by treatment with silibinin
alone or silibinin plus TRAIL (Supplementary Fig. S1). When we
tested for changes in members of the MAPK signaling pathways
following treatment with silibinin or silibinin plus TRAIL, the
activities of JNK and p38 were rather slightly reduced and ERK
activities were not significantly altered (Supplementary Fig. S1).
These results suggest that these antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins
and MAPKs are not involved in silibinin-enhanced TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.
Based on the above results, we investigated whether downregulation of c-FLIP, survivin, or Akt actually mediates silibininfacilitated TRAIL-induced apoptosis using cell lines overexpressing
these antiapoptotic proteins. In U87MG cell lines established to
stably overexpress c-FLIPS or c-FLIPL, we observed significant
inhibition of cell death induced by silibinin plus TRAIL (Fig. 5B).
Similarly, survivin overexpression in U87MG cells also significantly attenuated silibinin-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 5C). In contrast, the cell death induced by the combined
treatment with silibinin and TRAIL was not affected in the stable
cell lines overexpressing active Akt (Supplementary Fig. S2A) or
in U87MG cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding
active Akt (Supplementary Fig. S2B), indicating that silibininmediated Akt down-regulation is not responsible for the
accelerated cell death in glioma cells cotreated with TRAIL.
Taken together, these results indicate that silibinin treatment
contributes to the recovery of TRAIL sensitivity in glioma cells by
inducing down-regulation of the antiapoptotic proteins c-FLIP
and survivin.
Finally, we investigated the molecular basis of silibinin-mediated
down-regulation of survivin and c-FLIP. RT-PCR analysis showed
that the mRNA levels of FLIPS, FLIPL, and survivin were not
affected by silibinin treatment (Fig. 6A). In contrast, pretreatment
with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 attenuated the silibinininduced down-regulation of these proteins (Fig. 6B), suggesting
that silibinin may reduce the protein levels of FLIPS, FLIPL, and

survivin via proteasome-mediated degradation rather than through
transcriptional control. Next, we examined whether silibinininduced up-regulation of DR5 and down-regulation of FLIPS, FLIPL,
and survivin were dependent on one another. Suppression of DR5
or CHOP by siRNA-mediated knockdown did not affect silibinin-

mediated down-regulation of c-FLIPS, c-FLIPL, or survivin (Fig. 6C).
Western blotting analysis of the cell lines stably overexpressing
c-FLIPS, c-FLIPL, and survivin also showed that silibinin-induced
modulation of the other nonoverexpressed apoptotic regulators
(including DR5) was similar between overexpressing and control

Figure 3. Silibinin-induced DR5 up-regulation is critical for sensitization of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. A, silibinin up-regulates DR5 but not DR4 in U251MG and
U87MG cells. U251MG and U87MG cells were treated with 150 Amol/L silibinin for the indicated time points. Cell extracts were prepared for Western blotting of DR5
and DR4. Western blotting of a-tubulin was used as a loading control. B, silibinin dose dependently up-regulates DR5 protein in various glioma cells. Four different
glioma cells were treated with silibinin at the indicated concentrations for 16 h. Cell extracts were prepared for Western blotting of DR5, DR4, DcR1, DcR2, and a-tubulin.
C, effect of silibinin alone or silibinin plus TRAIL on the surface expression of DR5. After treatment with 150 Amol/L silibinin alone or 150 Amol/L silibinin plus

cells. These results suggest that the expression levels of multiple
components of the death receptor–mediated apoptotic pathway
are independently controlled by silibinin rather than via upstream
or downstream relationships.

Discussion
The effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy in
cancer treatment has been limited by systemic toxicity. Thus, a
major goal for the development of effective cancer therapeutics has
been to identify agents capable of selectively inducing cell death in
cancer cells without damaging normal cells. TRAIL seems to be a
good candidate because it shows selective toxicity to some tumor
cells with minimal toxicity to normal cells (3, 4). However, various
cancer cells reportedly show resistance to the cytotoxic effects of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

TRAIL (5, 6). These include various glioma cells, although they
express the TRAIL receptor DR5 (7). Therefore, researchers are
currently seeking to identify effective sensitizers for TRAIL-induced
apoptosis that may allow cancer cells to recover TRAIL sensitivity.
Silibinin is a polyphenolic flavonoid isolated from the seeds of
milk thistle (Silybum marianum; ref. 25). For more than 25 years,
silibinin and its crude form, silymarin, have been used clinically
and as dietary supplements against liver toxicity (26). Silibinin has
proven nontoxic in various animal models with different modes of
administration (8, 26, 27). Accumulating experimental and clinical
evidence indicates that consumption of silibinin as a drug or
dietary supplement seems to be safe and does not exert adverse
health effects (26). Recent studies have shown that silibinin shows
anticancer efficacy against a broad range of epithelial cancers in
cell culture studies (28) and dietary silibinin was shown to inhibit

the growth and progression of lung (29) and prostate cancers (30)
in rodent models. These findings suggest that silibinin may be
useful as an anticancer drug or as an adjunct in combination
therapy. Here, we show for the first time that silibinin effectively
sensitizes human glioma cells, but not normal astrocytes, to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In our study, 100 to 150 Amol/L silibinin
was required for effective enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Agarwal et al. (31) recently have reported that up to 165 Amol/L
total silibinin levels can be achieved in the plasma without any
signs of gross toxicity in terms of diet, water consumption, and
weight gain profiles in silibinin-treated groups of animals versus
controls. Furthermore, in recent clinical trial with escalating doses
of silibinin in prostate cancer patients, a peak level of >100 Amol/L
silibinin in plasma has been observed (32). Therefore, the silibinin
concentrations used in the present study may be pharmacologically
achievable in vivo in mice as well as humans. In both U87MG and
U251MG cells, which are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis,
TRAIL treatment triggered partial processing of procaspase-3 into
the p20 fragment but did not induce any further processing into
the active subunits. In contrast, cells cotreated with silibinin plus

TRAIL showed full processing from the p20 intermediate form to
the active p17 and p12 forms of caspase-3. Our results collectively
revealed that the molecular basis of the sensitizing effect of
silibinin on TRAIL-induced apoptosis may be summarized as
follows: (a) silibinin increases expression of the TRAIL receptor
DR5, thereby amplifying TRAIL-induced death receptor–mediated
apoptotic signaling; (b) silibinin reduces the protein levels of
c-FLIP, an inhibitor of initiator caspase-8; and (c) silibinin reduces
the protein levels of survivin, an inhibitor of effector caspases. The
latter two functions act to reduce the apoptotic threshold by
removing the barriers of caspase activation in this system.
TRAIL is known to trigger apoptosis through binding to its death
receptors, DR4 (33) and DR5 (33, 34). The expression level of these
death receptors may play a critical role in determining the intensity
and/or duration of death receptor–mediated apoptotic signaling in
response to TRAIL. Here, we show that silibinin-facilitated TRAILinduced apoptosis was accompanied by up-regulation of DR5, but
not DR4, in various glioma cells. Administration of siRNA against
DR5 efficiently reduced the cell death induced by the combined
treatment, showing the involvement of DR5. We recently showed

that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DR5 up-regulation is
critical for sulforaphane-stimulated TRAIL-induced apoptosis (35).
In the present study, however, we found that pretreatments with
the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or overexpression of catalase
failed to block silibinin-induced DR5 up-regulation and apoptosis
induced by combined treatment with silibinin and TRAIL in glioma
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that ROS are not
associated with silibinin-induced DR5 up-regulation in this system.
CHOP/GADD153 has been reported to be involved in the upregulation of DR5 and the sensitization of TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis by MG132 (19) and tunicamycin (20). Consistent with
these previous reports, we found that silibinin treatment increased
the mRNA and protein levels of CHOP, and siRNA-mediated CHOP
knockdown significantly blocked the cell death induced by silibinin
plus TRAIL, indicating that CHOP seems to be mechanistically
involved in this effect.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

Another mechanism potentially involved in the regulation of
TRAIL sensitivity is expressional modulation of the death receptor
inhibitors c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS (21), two proteins with very short
half-lives (36). Previous studies have shown that different treatments, such as synthetic triterpenoids and flavopiridol, can induce
down-regulation of c-FLIP and subsequent sensitization to TRAILinduced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (37, 38). In the present
study, we found that treatment of different glioma cells with
silibinin induced significant down-regulation of both c-FLIPL, and
c-FLIPS, suggesting that silibinin-induced loss of c-FLIP expression
may underlie the observed sensitization to TRAIL. Supporting this
idea, overexpression of both c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS reduced the cell
death induced by combined treatment with silibinin and TRAIL.
Although c-FLIP can be transcriptionally regulated through the
nuclear factor-nB pathway (39), we did not observe any significant
decrease in c-FLIP mRNA in silibinin-treated U251MG cells,

indicating that the inhibitory action of silibinin is not mediated
through transcriptional regulation of c-FLIP. Previous reports have
indicated that c-FLIP protein levels can be down-regulated by
proteasomal degradation (36, 38), and this modulation may lead to
TRAIL sensitization (38). Consistent with this notion, pretreatment
of U251MG cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 attenuated
silibinin-induced down-regulation of c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL, suggesting that silibinin treatment triggers proteasome-mediated
degradation of the c-FLIP isoforms. Recently, JNK activation by
TNF-a was shown to reduce c-FLIPL stability via JNK-mediated
phosphorylation and activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch,
which ubiquitinates c-FLIPL and induces its proteasomal degradation (40). However, we found that silibinin treatment did not
activate JNK in our system; indeed, it slightly reduced JNK activity
(Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that JNK-dependent phosphorylation is not involved in the silibinin-induced proteasomal degradation of c-FLIP in glioma cells. Further work will be required to
fully clarify the molecular mechanism responsible for the silibinininduced proteasomal degradation of c-FLIP in glioma cells.
In addition to DR5 up-regulation and c-FLIP down-regulation by
silibinin, we found that down-regulation of survivin also contributed
to silibinin-facilitated TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Survivin, a member
of the IAP family, is overexpressed in many glioma cells and has been
associated with poor prognosis (41). Survivin prevents apoptosis by
direct or indirect inhibition of downstream effector caspases (42),
and siRNA-mediated survivin knockdown has been reported to
sensitize human melanoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (43).
Here, we found that overexpression of survivin in glioma cells
significantly inhibited silibinin-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
Polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent destruction of survivin have been shown in interphase cells, and mitotic phosphorylation of survivin Thr34 by Cdc2-cyclin B1 has been associated with

increased protein stability at metaphase (44, 45). However, we failed
to observe significant down-regulation of Cdc2, cyclin A, and cyclin B
protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S4) or down-regulation of XIAP,
another target protein of Cdc2 inhibition (6, 7), excluding the
possible involvement of Cdc2 as an upstream signaling partner
during silibinin-induced down-regulation of survivin. However,
although the mRNA levels of survivin were not affected by silibinin
treatment, pretreatment of glioma cells with MG132 significantly
inhibited silibinin-induced down-regulation of survivin, suggesting
that silibinin may promote proteasome-mediated degradation of
survivin in a Cdc2-independent fashion.
In conclusion, we herein show for the first time that silibinin
effectively recovers TRAIL sensitivity in glioma cells via modulation
of multiple components of the death receptor–mediated signaling
pathway, including DR5, c-FLIP, and survivin. Combined treatment
with silibinin and TRAIL was strongly cytotoxic to various glioma
cells but did not affect the viability of normal astrocytes. Therefore,
combined treatment with silibinin and TRAIL seems to warrant
additional study as a potential new strategy for treating TRAILresistant gliomas.
