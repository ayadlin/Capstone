Abstract
The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical activity, safety and
predictive biomarkers of dacomitinib, an irreversible pan-HER inhibitor, in patients
with recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (R/M-ESCC).
Patients, whose diseases were not amenable to curative treatment and had progressed
on platinum-based chemotherapy, were treated with dacomitinib 45mg/day. The
primary endpoint was objective response rate by RECISTv 1.1. Predictive biomarker
analyses included the characterization of somatic mutations and gene expression
using the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel and Nanostring nCounter, and
investigation of their relationship with clinical outcomes. Of the 48 evaluable patients,

6 (12.5%) achieved partial responses and 29 (60.4%) had stable disease. The median
response duration was 7.1 months. The median progression free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) was 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.4-4.3 months) and 6.4 months (95%
CI, 4.4-8.4 months). Adverse events were mostly grade 1-2. Gene set enrichment
analysis revealed that ERBB signaling pathway is significantly enriched in patients
with PFS ≥4 months (n = 12) than PFS < 4 months (n = 21) (p < 0.001). Upregulation
of ERBB signaling pathway was significantly associated with longer PFS (5.0 vs. 2.9
months, P = 0.016) and OS (10.0 vs. 4.8 months, P = 0.022). The most frequent
mutations were TP53 (61%) followed by CDKN2A (8%), MLH1 (8%), FLT3 (8%)
and EGFR (8%). Dacomitinib demonstrated clinical efficacy with manageable toxicity
in platinum-failed R/M-ESCC. Screening of ERBB pathway-related gene expression
profiles may help identify patients who are most likely benefit from dacomitinib.

Introduction

The EGFR family (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1, ErbB2/
HER2, ErbB3/HER3, ErbB4/HER4) plays an essential
role in mediating cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and
metastasis. Therefore, it has become an important
therapeutic target in NSCLC, breast cancer and head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma. EGFR overexpression and
amplification was frequently observed in ESCC and was
correlated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis
[5]. Moreover, overexpression of HER2-4 has been
reported to be present in 30% to 80% of ESCC[6, 7].
In this context, there is a strong rationale for
investigation of biologic agents targeting EGFR family in
ESCC. Gefitinib and erlotinib are EGFR-tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) which selectively block EGFR signaling
through competitive reversible binding at intracellular
EGFR-TK domain. In a small phase II study, gefitinib
showed limited activity (ORR, 2.8%; OS, 164 days) in
second-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer [8].
Of note, a higher rate of disease control with gefitinib was
observed in female patients with ESCC and high EGFR
expression. Erlotinib also exhibited higher ORR (15% vs.
0%) and longer time to progression (3.3 vs. 1.6 months)
in ESCC, compared with adenocarcinoma [9]. Based on
these studies, further evaluation of EGFR-targeted therapy
in advanced ESCC is strongly warranted.
Dacomitinib (PF-00299804) is a potent, irreversible
pan-HER
inhibitor.
Dacomitinib
demonstrated
encouraging clinical activity against EGFR mutationpositive NSCLC and head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas [10, 11]. Because EGFR family members act
together via hetero- and homodimerization to activate
oncogenic signaling pathways, combined inhibition of all
EGFR family kinases may have more potent antitumor
activity than the EGFR inhibition alone.
This phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01608022) assessed the efficacy, safety, and
predictive biomarkers of dacomitinib in patients with
R/M-ESCC who progressed after 1 or 2 chemotherapy
regimens.

Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause
of cancer deaths worldwide [1]. Two major histologic
subtypes of esophageal cancer, adenocarcinoma and
squamous cell carcinoma, have different epidemiology
and risk factors. Esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is
associated with gastroesophageal reflux and obesity, has
become more common in Western countries. In many
Asian countries, however, esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (ESCC), of which risk factors are smoking and
alcohol abuse, represents the most common esophageal
cancer [2].
Despite modest improvements in survival with
multimodal therapy, the prognosis for patients with
locally advanced ESCC remains dismal, with a 5-year
survival rate below 30%. The majority of patients
with locally advanced disease will develop both local
and distant recurrences and will die within a year after
recurrence. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the
backbone of treatment in recurrent or metastatic ESCC
(R/M-ESCC). However, clinical benefit of the platinumbased chemotherapy is typically modest with reported
objective response rate (ORR) of 20 to 35% and median
overall survival (OS) of 7 to 9 months [3, 4]. Although
a number of patients who progress after platinum-based
chemotherapy may still be fit for second-line treatment,
no treatments are available with proven efficacy for these
patients.
Over the past decade, molecularly targeted therapies,
which block important oncogenic pathways, have made
remarkable progress, especially in epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). In contrast, there have been only
a few clinical trials with targeted agents in R/M-ESCC.
Moreover, despite potential clinical and/or biological
heterogeneity, most clinical trials included both squamous
and adenocarcinoma histologies without the identified
druggable target that showed clinical benefit. Given a high
rate of older age and/or comorbidities, there is a pressing
need for biomarker-directed targeted therapy to improve
the efficacy and tolerability in ESCC patients.

Results

Between June 2012 to Aug 2013, a total of 49
patients were enrolled into the study and were received at
least one dose of dacomitinib. The patient characteristics
are listed in Table 1. The median age was 64 years.
Majority of patients were male and ECOG PS 0-1.
Approximately 40% of the patients had both locoregional
and distant diseases in at least 3 organ sites. Two thirds
of patients (73.5%) had received two or more treatment
modalities including surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy prior to enrollment. Thirty-three patients
(67.3%) received dacomitinib as second-line treatment
and sixteen patients (32.7%) received as third-line
chemotherapy. Approximately 60% of patients received
5-fluorouracil and cisplatin prior to enrollment. The
median time from initial diagnosis to the study enrollment
was 10.3 months (range, 2.5 to 93 months).

partial responses (Table 2). The six patients had PRs
lasting 16.6+, 8.5, 7.1, 4.1, 2.0, 2.0 months, respectively,
with the median response duration of 7.1 months. Twentynine patients (60.4%) had stable disease and 13 patients
(27.1%) experienced progression. The 8-week DCR was
72.9 % (35/48). The median number of treatment cycle
was 3 (range, 1-21) and the median treatment duration
is 2.9 months (range, 0.6-21.6 months) with 9 patients
(18.4%) treated for longer than 6 months. Reasons for
treatment discontinuation were disease progression (n
= 43, 87.8%), refusal of the patient because of adverse
events (n = 3, 6.1%), and other medical conditions (n = 2,
4.1%, infection).
With a median follow-up of 12.1 months, the median
PFS was 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.4-4.3 months). Fifteen
patients (30.6%) were progression free at 4 months and
were considered to achieve clinical benefit (Supplementary
Figure 1A). The median OS was 6.4 months (95% CI,
4.4-8.4 months) and 5 patients (10.2%) were alive at 1
year (Supplementary Figure 1B). There was no significant
difference in PFS and OS for performance status, initial
stage at study entry, and body weight.

of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used
to identify differentially enriched signaling pathway
between patients with CB and non-CB on dacomitinib.
Among the 27 upregulated human KEGG pathway gene
sets, this approach identified 20 significant pathways at
25% false discovery rate (FDR) level (Supplementary
Table 1). Notable among them were the ERBB signaling
pathway, given the biologic and predictive potential of
ERBB pathway activation. The pathway enrichment plot
and expression profiles of a subset of genes contributing
significantly to the core enrichment in patients with CB
were shown in Figure 2A and 2B. Of the 87 pathwayaffiliated genes of the ERBB pathway, 20 genes
including ERBB4, EGF, EGFR, AKT1, and MAPK10
were differentially expressed between patients with CB
(n = 12) and non-CB (n = 21) (P < 0.001; Figure 2B).
Hierarchical cluster analysis demonstrated 33 tumors
could be classified into 2 clusters, each with distinctive
expression pattern of ERBB pathway genes. All but one
patient showing CB on dacomitinib belonged to cluster 1
with upregulation of ERBB pathway genes.
Notably, patients with upregulated ERBB pathway
(cluster 1, n = 14) showed significantly longer PFS (5.0
vs. 2.9 months, P = 0.016) and OS (10.0 vs 4.8 months,
P = 0.022), compared to those without (cluster 2, n = 19)
(Figure 3A, 3B). Furthermore, among the 32 evaluable
case, patients with upregulated ERBB pathway (3 out
of 14) tended to have higher ORR (21.4% vs. 5.6%, P =
0.18), compared to those without (1 out of 18).

Somatic mutation results were available in 36
patients (73.5%; Figure 4). Median sequencing depth
in target regions was 730X. Overall, we identified 44
somatic coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
small insertions/deletions (indels). The full list of somatic
mutations is provided in Supplementary Table 2. The list
of the 13 recurrently mutated genes in two or more tumors
or well-known driver cancer genes involved in 5 important
oncogenic pathways (cell cycle, PI3K/mTOR, receptor
tyrosine kinase, WNT and metabolism) is presented in
Figure 4. The most frequently mutated genes were TP53
(61%) followed by CDKN2A (8%), MLH1 (8%), FLT3
(8%), and EGFR (8%). EGFR mutations were found in 3
patients (1 CB, 2 non-CB). Interestingly, all these EGFR
mutations were not classic drug-sensitive exon 19 and 21
mutations frequently identified in NSCLC, but atypical
exon 20 mutations (V765M, C775Y, and G810D). No
specific mutation appeared to be enriched in patients with
CB.

Association of ERBB expression and sensitivity to
dacomitinib
To evaluate the association of drug sensitivity with
ERBB gene expression, we performed detail analysis
of cell viability assay with dacomitinib. Three ESCC
cell lines with various levels of EGFR were treated
with dacomitinib. Significant inhibition of tumor cell
growth by dacomitinib was found in cells with high-

expression was associated with sensitivity to dacomitinib
in ESCC cell lines.

The EGFR-targeted agents have demonstrated
only marginal benefit in unselected patients [8, 9, 15-17].
Therefore, selection of patients who are most likely to
respond to EGFR-targeted agents including dacomitinib
is an important challenge. Conflicting data exist regarding
the correlation between EGFR expression and response to
EGFR-targeted agent [8, 9, 21]. Furthermore, conclusions
that patients with EGFR overexpression derived benefit
from gefitinib or erlotinib were made based on small
sample size, which hampers the validity of such analysis.
In our study, comprehensive biomarker analysis identified
that the screening for ERBB-related gene expression
could help identify subgroups most likely benefit from
dacomitinib in R/M-ESCC. Several studies have shown
that gene expression signatures could serve as useful
molecular markers complementary to genetic mutations
or protein expressions in predicting clinical outcomes
to targeted therapies. For examples, in addition to
PIK3CA mutations, gene expression signature involved
in the PI3K pathway activity may have utility in the
identification of breast cancer patients likely to benefit
from a selective PI3K inhibitor therapy [22]. From a
study in NSCLC, mRNA expression of fibroblast growth
factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) was the better biomarker of
FGFR-TKI sensitivity than FGFR1 gene copy number or
protein expression [23]. Very recently, we demonstrated
that overexpression of inflammatory genes predicted
significantly worse survival to dacomitinib in head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma [11]. Collectively,
identification of ERBB pathway gene expression as a
potential biomarker can contribute to the successful
development of EGFR-targeted therapy in R/M-ESCC.
Our results need further validation in the future clinical
trials with EGFR inhibitors in ESCC patients.
Recently, whole exome sequencing studies in ESCC
have been reported, [24, 25] uncovering recurrent somatic
mutations in TP53 (60-93%), CDKN2A (3-8%), RB1
(8-9%), PIK3CA (7-9%) and PTEN (5%). In our study,
genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation
were mutated in 69% of cases by somatic alterations of
TP53 (61%), CDKN2A (8%) and MLH1 (8%), which
was comparable to the previous reports. Consistent with
previous reports [24, 25], we also found mutations in
PI3K/mTOR pathway including PIK3CA (3%), PTEN
(3%) and STK11 (3%). Although somatic mutations in
the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have been associated
with dramatic response to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC, these
drug-sensitive EGFR mutations are rare in ESCC [8, 9,
24, 25]. In our study, three patients harbored EGFR exon
20 mutations (V765M, G810D, C775Y). Interestingly,
a NSCLC patient with V765M EGFR mutations had
a partial response to gefitinib [26]. Consistent with this
report, a case with V765M EGFR mutation in our study
showed PFS of 4.1 months with 10% of tumor shrinkage.

Discussion
Because the majority of R/M-ESCC patients will
not benefit from second-line chemotherapy but will
nevertheless be subjected to potentially life-threatening
toxicities,[12] the development of effective targeted
therapy with predictive biomarker is of vital importance
in this population with poor prognosis. Nevertheless,
therapeutic advances in R/M-ESCC significantly lag
behind those for other solid tumors, such as NSCLC [13,
14].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
on efficacy, safety and predictive biomarkers of pan-HER
inhibitor in esophageal cancer. In our study, dacomitinib
showed promising clinical activity with manageable
toxicity in heavily-pretreated R/M-ESCC. We performed
next-generation sequencing and nanostring nCounter
gene expression assay in R/M-ESCC patients treated with
dacomitinib to identify potential predictive biomarkers
to this experimental agent. Using this approach, we
demonstrated that the upregulation of ERBB signaling
pathway may characterize a subgroup of patients who are
most likely to benefit from dacomitinib.
It seemed apparent that the clinical benefit of the
selective EGFR-TKI (gefitinib, erlotinib) or the EGFRspecific MoAB (cetuximab) were limited in esophageal
cancer, with reported ORR of 2.0%-6.6% and PFS of
1.6-1.8 months [8, 9, 15-18]. However, the efficacy of
dacomitinib in our study (ORR, 12.5%; PFS, 3.3 months)
exceeded reports from previous studies with selective
EGFR-targeted therapies. Furthermore, we observed
8-week DCR of approximately 72.9% in this population
with poor prognosis, which could partly be attributed
to the potential of dacomitinib to simultaneously block
compensatory signaling from other HER receptors. The
pan-HER inhibitory effects of dacomitinib might induce
disease stabilization rather than tumor shrinkage, resulting
in modest ORR but high DCR. Our results deserves
attention, given that patients enrolled in our study had
multiple poor prognostic factors (one third had progressive
disease after 2 prior chemotherapy regimens and had both
locoregional and distant diseases).
Treatment with dacomitinib in heavily pretreated
R/M-ESCC patients was well tolerated with the frequency
of AEs comparable to that seen in other studies with
EGFR-targeted agents. All toxicities reported in our
study were mostly grade 1-2 and easily manageable with
supportive care. There has been controversy regarding
the relationship between acneiform skin rash and clinical
outcome to EGFR-targeted therapies [19, 20]. However,
acneiform skin rash were not found to be associated with
clinical outcomes in our study.

In conclusion, dacomitinib demonstrated promising
efficacy in platinum-failed R/M-ESCC. Screening of
ERBB pathway-related gene expression profiles may
help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from
dacomitinib. The value of ERBB gene expression profiling
in predicting clinical outcome to dacomitinib needs to be
validated in future randomized trials.

maximum of 2 dose-level reductions were permitted (30
mg then 15 mg). Dacomitinib administration could be
interrupted for a maximum of 21 days.

Study assessment
Baseline evaluations included a complete medical
history, physical and radiologic examinations, complete
blood count, and biochemistries. Response evaluations
were defined according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines.
Radiographic imaging was conducted at week 4, week
8 and every 8 weeks thereafter until disease progression
or when clinically indicated. If a patient had a CR or
PR, a confirmatory evaluation was performed after 4
weeks. Safety was measured by assessment of physical
examination, documentation of AEs, laboratory
measurements on day 1 of each cycle. AEs were graded
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events version 4.0 [30].

Patients and methods
Study design
This was a multicenter, open-label phase II study of
dacomitinib in patients with recurrent or metastatic ESCC
(R/M-ESCC) who had progressed on platinum-based
chemotherapy. The primary objective of this study was
to assess objective response rate according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1
[29]; secondary end points were to estimate the clinical
benefit [CB, progression free survival (PFS) ≥ 4 months
of dacomitinib], duration of responses, disease control
rate at 8 weeks [8-week DCR; complete response (CR)+
partial response (PR)+ stable disease (SD) at 8 weeks),
PFS, OS, and the tolerability of the treatment. Exploratory
objectives were to evaluate whether somatic mutation or
gene expression are correlated with clinical outcomes.
All patients provided signed informed consent and
the study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki
Declaration. The study was approved by the institutional
review board.

Biomarker analyses
Fresh or archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded
(FFPE) tumor tissues were collected at baseline for
biomarker analysis, which included characterization
of gene expression by Nanostring nCounter® Cancer
Human Cancer Reference Kit, which is a sensitive
assay quantifying mRNA transcripts of 230 genes using
multiplexed, color-coded probes, and somatic mutations
by Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2
(CHPv2), which is a next generation sequencing assay
detecting 2,800 Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In
Cancer (COSMIC) mutations from 50 genes. The sets
of genes for expression and mutation analysis were
listed in Supplementary Table 3. These two analytical
platforms have been previously validated with FFPE
clinical samples.[31-33] Analysis and normalization of
the raw Nanostring data was conducted using nSolver
Analysis Software v1.1 (Nanostring Technologies).
For a significance analysis of gene expression, gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA; http://www.broad.mit.edu/
gsea) were performed with a ratio-of-classes metric for
gene ranking and 1000 data permutations. Among the 49
cases, 7 cases had insufficient tumor and 6 and 9 cases
had insufficient DNA and RNA, respectively. Overall 36
and 33 cases had successful AmpliSeq and Nanostring
analyses.

Study population
Patients with pathologically confirmed R/M-ESCC
not amenable to curative treatment were enrolled. Patients
were at least age of 18 years, had an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 to
2, had at least one measurable lesion, had experienced
treatment failure with one to two prior chemotherapy
regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy,
and had a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Patients
with prior EGFR inhibitors and ≥ 3 lines of palliative
chemotherapy for R/M-ESCC were ineligible.

Treatment

Statistical rationale for study design and statistical
analysis

Patients received continuous treatment with oral
dacomitinib 45 mg once daily until disease progression,
death, or unacceptable adverse events (AEs). Treatment
cycle was 28 days long. Drug doses withheld and/or
reduced for intolerable grade 2 or grade 3/4 toxicity. A

A Fleming’s one-stage design was used to test the
null hypothesis (P0) with 5% significance level that the
ORR is ≤ 5% versus the alternative hypothesis (P1) that

the ORR is ≥ 15%. Forty-four response-evaluable patients
were required to provide 80% power to reject P0 when
the true ORR is 15%. Allowing for 10 % loss to followup rate, it is anticipated that the total sample size is 49.
PFS was defined from the first day of dacomitinib until the
first disease progression or death from any cause. OS was
defined from the first day of dacomitinib to death from any
cause. For the predictive biomarker analysis, we defined
clinical benefit (CB) as PFS ≥ 4 months on dacomitinib
based on the previous results that second-line therapies
with either cytotoxic agent or EGFR inhibitors in R/MESCC have shown PFS of less than 4 months [16, 34, 35].
PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and compared using generalized Wilcoxon test.
The association of biomarkers with clinical outcomes was
analyzed using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. P-value ≤
0.05 was considered significant.
