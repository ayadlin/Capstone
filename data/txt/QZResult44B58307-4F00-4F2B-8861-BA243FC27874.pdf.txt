Abstract
Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) oncoproteins are
phosphatases overexpressed in numerous types of human
cancer. Elevated levels of PRL associate with metastasis and
poor clinical outcomes. In principle, PRL phosphatases offer
appealing therapeutic targets, but they remain underexplored
due to the lack of speciﬁc chemical probes. In this study, we
address this issue by exploiting a unique property of PRL
phosphatases, namely, that they may function as homotrimers.
Starting from a sequential structure-based virtual screening
and medicinal chemistry strategy, we identiﬁed Cmpd-43 and
several analogs that disrupt PRL1 trimerization. Biochemical

and structural analyses demonstrate that Cmpd-43 and its
close analogs directly bind the PRL1 trimer interface and
obstruct PRL1 trimerization. Cmpd-43 also speciﬁcally blocks
the PRL1-induced cell proliferation and migration through
attenuation of both ERK1/2 and Akt activity. Importantly,
Cmpd-43 exerted potent anticancer activity both in vitro
and in vivo in a murine xenograft model of melanoma. Our
results validate a trimerization-dependent signaling mechanism for PRL and offer proof of concept for trimerization inhibitors as candidate therapeutics to treat PRL-driven cancers.

Introduction

function as positive signal transducers capable of activating both
ERK1/2 (7–11) and Akt (12–15), two of the major pathways that
are aberrantly upregulated in cancer (16, 17). PRL1 was initially
identiﬁed as an immediate early gene induced during liver regeneration upon partial hepatectomy (18). Subsequent studies found
that exogenous expression of PRLs accelerates cell proliferation
and anchorage-independent growth (7, 18–21). Constitutive PRL
expression also promotes cell migration and invasion (7, 8, 11,
22–25). Moreover, PRL overexpressing cells form tumors with
high metastatic potential when injected into mice (9, 22, 23, 26),
whereas PRL knockdown reduces cell proliferation and migration
as well as tumorigenesis in vivo (9, 11, 25, 27–30). Most significantly, PRL level is elevated in human cancers of colon (31, 32),
liver (23, 33), ovarian (27, 34), prostate (35), gastric (36, 37),
pancreatic (13), and breast (9, 38), as well as in melanoma
(20, 39), multiple myeloma (40) and acute myeloid leukemia
(41, 42), and PRL overexpression strongly correlates with late-stage
metastasis and poor clinical outcomes. Taken together, the data
implicate PRLs as novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets
for metastatic cancers. Consequently, PRLs have garnered considerable interest for drug discovery (6). Unfortunately, the rather ﬂat
PRL active site and its structural similarity to other members of the
PTP family present signiﬁcant challenge for PRL inhibitor design.
Indeed, reported active site directed PRL inhibitors are neither
sufﬁciently potent nor selective, and so are not suitable for in vivo
pharmacologic study and therapeutic development (6).
We describe a novel approach to inhibit PRL function by
targeting a unique structural and regulatory property of the
PRLs. One of the most striking features of PRL1 is that it exists
as a trimer in the crystalline state and has a high propensity to
form trimer in solution and inside the cell (8, 10, 43, 44).
Moreover, trimer formation is essential for PRL1-mediated cell
growth and migration, suggesting that small molecules targeting the trimeric interface of PRLs could potentially have therapeutic value (8). To capitalize on these ﬁndings, we used a
computer-based virtual screen to search the available chemical

Reversible and coordinated protein tyrosine phosphorylation
is central to diverse signal pathways regulating cell growth, migration, and survival. Disturbance of the normal pattern of tyrosine
phosphorylation, due to perturbed balance between the activities
of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), causes abnormal cell signaling and has been linked to
the etiology of many human diseases including cancer (1). Thus,
there is vast interest in targeting dysfunctional pathways driven by
aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation for therapeutic interventions.
Notable success has been achieved by targeting the PTKs, as shown
by the more than two-dozen small molecule inhibitors already in
the clinic (2). However, resistance to kinase inhibitor treatments
prevents durable responses. Therefore, there is heightened interest
to modulate disease progression at the level of PTPs.
The phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) phosphatases
constitute a unique group of PTPs, with three closely related
members (PRL1, 2, and 3; refs. 3–6). Unlike other PTPs, the PRLs

Cmpd-43 and its close analogs bind the PRL1 trimer interface
and block PRL1 trimerization. Cmpd-43 also speciﬁcally abrogates the PRL1-induced cell proliferation and migration
through attenuation of both ERK1/2 and Akt activity. Importantly, Cmpd-43 exhibits excellent anticancer activity both in
vitro and in a xenograft mouse model of melanoma. The study
provides pharmacological validation that trimerization is
important for PRL1 function and targeting PRL trimerization
is a viable approach for therapeutic development.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Anti-HA, anti-tubulin, and anti-GAPDH antibodies were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-ERK1/2,
anti-pERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-Akt, anti-pAkt (Ser473),
and anti-LSD1 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology. DMEM, FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin were
from Invitrogen. HEK293, MeWo, and MCF7 cell lines were
purchased directly from ATCC between 2008 and 2015. The
ATCC cell lines were characterized by short tandem repeat
(STR) DNA proﬁling. MCF10A cell was received as a gift from
Dr. Mircea Ivan's lab in Indiana University School of Medicine
(Indianapolis, Indiana), and was authenticated by morphology. All cell lines were passaged for fewer than 6 months after
resuscitation.
Virtual screening
Asinex and ChemBridge subsets in ZINC (45) database were
downloaded from ZINC website (http://zinc.docking.org) and
used for virtual screening. The monomer B in PRL1 trimer structure (PDBID: 1ZCK; ref. 44) was used as receptor, and the
coordinates were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank. The
DOCK6.2 program (46) was used for rigid docking to generate
a potential subset of molecules binding at PRL1 trimer interface,
and then AutoDock4.01 software (47) was used for ﬂexible
docking to get the most potent hits.
In the ﬁrst-stage docking, the structure of monomer B was
processed using the "Dock Prep" module in UCSF CHIMERA,
then the docking region was deﬁned through a standard pipeline of running dms, sphgen, sphere_selector, and showbox program, and the energy scoring values were calculated by grid
program. About 560,000 small molecules (downloaded in 28
mol2 ﬁles, 20,000 molecules in each ﬁle) were submitted to
the dock6.mpi program to perform docking calculations simultaneously. During each docking, the small molecule was positioned with 1,000 orientations, the lowest interaction energy
and corresponding conformation was recorded. All ligands in
each mol2 ﬁle were ranked according to their lowest interaction
energy, and the top 2,000 were kept for the second-stage
docking, thus 56,000 (2,000  28) molecules were picked out
for next-stage screening.
In the second-stage docking, the structure of monomer B was
processed in AutoDockTools1.4 software, Gasteiger charge was
added and nonpolar hydrogens were merged. The docking area
was designated around the BA or BC interface, and the energy grids
of 51  51  73 points with 0.375 Å spacing on each axis were
calculated for 17 atom types (H, HD, HS, C, A, N, NA, NS, OA, OS,
F, P, SA, S, Cl, Br, and I), as well as the electrostatic and desolvation
potential using autogrid4 program. On the contrary, each ligand

4806 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

structure was used to generate pdbqt and dpf ﬁles using prepare_ligand4.py and prepare_dpf4.py scripts. Based on these prepared
ﬁles, molecular docking was carried out in autodock4 program as
follows: 10 separate docking runs were performed for each ligand.
In each docking run, the optimal binding conformation was
achieved by Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm with Local Search
(LGALS) method. After all ligands were docked, the lowest binding free energy of each ligand was extracted and ranked, and hit
molecules were picked out through binding free energy comparisons, structure similarity analyses and binding mode inspections.
Cell culture and transfection
HEK293, MeWo, and MCF7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (50 units/mL), and streptomycin (50 mg/mL) in a 37 C incubator containing 5% CO2.
MCF10A cells were grown in Mammary Epithelial Basal Medium
supplemented with MEGM Single Quots and 100 ng/mL cholera
toxin (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). HEK293 cells were seeded at
40% conﬂuence in antibiotic-free medium and grown overnight.
Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 from
Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Wound healing assay
Cells were grown to 90% conﬂuence in a 12-well plate at 37 C
in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. A wound was created by scratching
cells with a sterile 200 mL pipette tip. Cells were washed with
PBS to remove the ﬂoating cells, and then treated with fresh
medium containing 20 mmol/L compound or DMSO. The
wounds were photographed at 0 and 24 hours under 10
magnitude microscope. Wound healing magnitude was quantiﬁed by measuring the relative wound closure compared with
control cells at 24 hours.
MTT assay
Cells were seeded in a 96-multiwell plate (3,000 cells/well)
containing DMEM, 10% FBS at 37 C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2
overnight. Cells were then treated with various concentrations of
compounds or DMSO for 24 and 48 hours. Cell proliferation was
then determined by MTT assay as described previously (8) using a
multiwall spectrophotometer. Data are presented as relative proliferation rate compared with control cells.
Cell migration assay
Cell migration was determined as described previously (10)
with some modiﬁcations. The assay was performed with Transwells (6.5 mm diameter; 8 mm pore size polycarbonate membrane) obtained from Corning Costar. Cells (3.75  105) in 1.5
mL of serum-free medium were placed in the upper chamber,
whereas the lower chamber was loaded with 2.5 mL of medium
containing 10% FBS. Cells were then treated with 10 mmol/L of
different compounds as indicated. After 24-hour incubation
(37 C, 5% CO2), the total number of cells that had migrated
into the lower chamber was counted with a hemacytometer. Data
are presented as relative migration rate compared with control
cells. Cell motility of MeWo cells was also measured using live-cell
imaging. 5  103/well of MeWo cells were seeded in a 96-well
plate for overnight and then treated with 5 mmol/L of Cmpd-43 for
4 hours. One mg/mL of Hoechst 33342 was used to label the
nuclei, and Thermo Scientiﬁc ArrayScan XTI Live High Content
Platform was then used for live-cell tracking to measure the
motility in the presence of Cmpd-43. Motility of the cells was

assessed over 6 hours and image data were collected every 30
minutes.
Animal experiments
NSG (NOD/scid/IL2Rgnull) mice were purchased from In Vivo
Therapeutics Core at Indiana University Simon Cancer Center.
Experiments on mice were carried out in accordance with the
regulations of The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
at Indiana University. All mice were housed under pathogen-free
conditions in the animal facility and received autoclaved water
and food. Ten to twelve weeks old NSG mice were used in the
study. MeWo cells were suspended in PBS at 8  107 cells/mL. A
total of 8  106 cells (100 mL) were subcutaneously implanted
into both left and right ﬂank (n ¼ 24) using a 27-gauge needle.
Once the tumor volume reaches 200 mm3, daily intraperitoneal
injection of either control or 30 mg/kg Cmpd-43 was performed,
and the tumor growth was monitored for 3 weeks. Tumor volume
was calculated using the formula V ¼ (W2  L)/2 for caliper
measurements. Mice were sacriﬁced after injection for 21 days,
and organs were collected for immunohistological and biochemical analysis.
Statistical analysis
For cell-based proliferation, migration, and wound healing
assays, the Student t test was used to measure the signiﬁcance.
For MeWo cell xenograft tumors, tumor volumes at different
time and ﬁnal tumor weights were compared using the Student
t test. In comparing the mRNA level of PRLs in human normal
skin and melanoma samples, Student t test was used to assess
the signiﬁcance of differences between groups. Survival analysis
was performed according to the Kaplan–Meier method and
the log-rank test, a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results and Discussion
Identiﬁcation of small molecule PRL1 detrimerizers
Given the functional requirement of PRL trimerization, disruption of PRL trimerization was proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for PRL-based drug discovery (8), but this strategy has not been validated with pharmacologic approaches. As
revealed by the homotrimeric PRL1 crystal structure (44), each
PRL1 monomer (e.g., monomer B) has two dimer interfaces,
namely the BA (residues from 125 to 150) and BC interfaces
(residues from 11 to 18, 36 to 41, and 92 to 98), which are 18 and
19 Å away from the active site Cys104 in the catalytic P-loop C104
VAGLGR110 (Fig. 1A). To discover small molecules capable of
blocking PRL1 trimerization, we used structure-based virtual
screening to identify compounds that bind to the dimer interfaces
in each PRL1 monomer. We employed a sequential screening
strategy, starting with rigid docking in DOCK6.2 (46) to sample a
total of 560,000 compounds (Asinex and ChemBridge subsets in
the ZINC database; ref. 45) to each dimer interface and score
protein–ligand complexes based on the calculated interaction
energies, which was followed by ﬂexible docking in AutoDock4.01 (47) to analyze the top 10% hits obtained from rigid
docking (Fig. 1B). This process led to the selection of 100 topranked compounds for each interface. Upon further binding
mode veriﬁcation and structural similarity analyses, 56 structurally diverse compounds were purchased for further experimental
evaluation.

www.aacrjournals.org

The ability of the 56 compounds to disrupt PRL1 trimerization
was initially assessed by in vitro cross-linking experiments using
recombinant PRL1 protein (44). Ten of the 56 compounds
exhibited signiﬁcant activity in blocking PRL1 trimerization. To
further conﬁrm the efﬁciency of these compounds to disrupt PRL1
trimer formation, we also evaluated them in an in vivo cell-based
cross-linking assay. HA-tagged PRL1 expressing HEK293 cells
were treated with the compounds, ﬁxed with 1% formaldehyde,
and the HA-tagged PRL1 was immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, the top three
compounds, Cmpd-3, Cmpd-26, and Cmpd-43, signiﬁcantly
decreased PRL1 trimer formation inside the cell, with Cmpd-43
being the most potent PRL1 detrimerizer (Fig. 1D). Importantly,
Cmpd-43 at 20 mmol/L did not inhibit the phosphatase activity of
PRL1 as well as a large panel of PTPs including receptor-like PTPs,
PTPm, PTPe, LAR, PTPs and PTPg, cytosolic PTPs, PTP1B, Lyp,
SHP1, PTPH1, HePTP, STEP, and PEZ, the dual speciﬁcity phosphatase VHR, VHZ, MKP5, CDC14A, and the low molecular
weight PTP.
Given that PRL1 trimerization is essential for the PRL1mediated cell proliferation and migration (8), Cmpd-43 is
expected to suppress both cellular processes if it disrupts PRL1
trimerization inside the cell. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of Cmpd-43 on cell proliferation and migration in PRL1-expressing HEK293 cells. As expected, Cmpd-43
inhibited PRL1 induced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1E). In addition, Cmpd-43 also markedly delayed
the wound closure induced by PRL1 overexpression (Fig. 1F).
To delineate the structural features of Cmpd-43 important for
inhibiting PRL1-mediated cellular processes, a series of Cmpd43 derivatives were either purchased (Analogs 1 to 4) or
synthesized (Analogs 5 to 7; Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B and
C, Analog-3 displayed similar efﬁcacy as Cmpd-43 in attenuating PRL1 induced cell proliferation and migration, whereas
Analogs 2 and 4–7 appeared slightly less effective than Cmpd43. Interestingly, Analog-1 exerted no effect on either cell
proliferation or migration, suggesting that the iminomethylaromatic moiety, which is missing in Analog-1, is critical for the
inhibitory activity of Cmpd-43 and the other 6 analogs. Collectively, through a two-stage virtual screening strategy, biochemical and cell-based evaluation, and a limited structure and
activity analysis, we identiﬁed Cmpd-43 and several analogs as
potential disruptors of PRL1 trimerization. We also found a
structurally related but inactive Analog 1, which could serve as a
negative control in mechanistic studies.
Cmpd-43 speciﬁcally blocks PRL1-mediated signaling, cell
proliferation, and migration
Before Cmpd-43 can be used as a chemical probe to address
PRL1's roles in normal physiology and in cancer and serve as a
lead for therapeutic development, it is important to establish
whether Cmpd-43 exerts its effect inside the cell through disruption of PRL1 trimerization and inhibition of PRL1-mediated
signaling. To this end, we ﬁrst compared the effect of Cmpd-43
and its inactive Analog-1 on PRL1 trimerization. As shown
in Fig. 3A, Cmpd-43 effectively blocked PRL1 trimerization in
HEK293 cells whereas at the same concentration Analog-1 had no
effect, consistent with its lack of inhibition in PRL1-mediated cell
proliferation and migration (Fig. 2B and C). To further evaluate
the speciﬁcity of Cmpd-43, we utilized a trimerization deﬁcient

and migration (8). Thus, Cmpd-43 would not be expected to
affect the growth and migration of PRL1/G97R-expressing cells if
its main mode of action is disrupting PRL1 trimerization. We ﬁrst
conﬁrmed that PRL1/G97R was defective in trimer formation (Fig.
3B). We also conﬁrmed that although ectopic expression of PRL1
increased both cell proliferation and migration, the rates for the
PRL1/G97R cells were similar to those of the vector control cells
(Fig. 3C and D), again validating the functional importance of
PRL1 trimerization. We then measured the effect of Cmpd-43 and
Analog-1 on the proliferation and migration of both wild-type
PRL1 and PRL1/G97R expressing cells. As expected, treatment
with Cmpd-43, but not Analog-1, attenuated PRL1-induced cell
proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas neither Analog-1 nor Cmpd-43 had any effect on PRL1/G97R-expressing cell

proliferation (Fig. 3C). Similarly, Cmpd-43, but not Analog-1,
was capable of reducing wild-type PRL1-induced cell migration,
whereas neither Cmpd-43 nor Analog-1 was able to alter the cell
migration behavior of the PRL1/G97R-expressing cells (Fig. 3D).
Finally, we evaluated Cmpd-43 in mouse embryo ﬁbroblast
(MEF) derived from either wild-type or PRL1-deﬁcient mice. As
expected, Cmpd-43 preferentially inhibited wild-type over
PRL1/ MEF cells (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that
Cmpd-43 exerted its antiproliferative activity through blocking
PRL1 trimerization.
PRL1 promotes cell proliferation and migration through activation of ERK1/2 and Akt pathways (8, 13, 24). To delineate the
biochemical mechanism by which Cmpd-43 exerts its inhibitory
activity on cell growth and migration, we analyzed the effect of
Cmpd-43 and Analog-1 on ERK1/2 and Akt activity in both wild-

Analog-3 binds to the PRL1 trimer interfaces and blocks PRL1
trimerization
To provide direct evidence that Cmpd-43 binds to the PRL1
trimer interfaces and to determine the molecular basis of PRL1
detrimerization by Cmpd-43, we sought to co-crystallize PRL1
with Cmpd-43 as well as Analog-3. We obtained co-crystals of
PRL1 bound with Analog-3. The 3D structure of PRL1 Analog-3
complex was solved by molecular replacement using monomer A
in the PRL1 trimer structure (PDBID: 1ZCK; ref. 44) as a search
model and reﬁned to 1.90 Å resolution. The ﬁnal atomic model
encompasses residues 4-160 of PRL1 and the intact Analog-3,
which is unambiguously identiﬁed by the unbiased Fo  Fc
omit density map (Fig. 4A). The details of data collection and
structure reﬁnement are summarized in Table 1. The complex
structure belongs to the C2221 space group with one PRL1

type PRL1 and the trimerization impaired PRL1/G97R mutant
expressing cells. Consistent with the results from the phenotypic
assays, expression of PRL1 increased ERK1/2 and Akt activity by
3.4- and 2.5-fold, respectively, whereas the activation status of
ERK1/2 and Akt in PRL1/G97R cells was similar to that of the
vector control cells (Fig. 3E). As expected, Cmpd-43 effectively
abrogated the PRL1-induced ERK1/2 and Akt activation whereas
the negative control Analog-1 had no effect on ERK/1/2 and Akt
activity. In line with PRL1/G97R being a loss of function mutant,
neither Cmpd-43 nor Analog-1 had any effect on ERK1/2 and Akt
signaling in PRL1/G97R cells. Collectively, these mechanistic
studies provide additional strong evidence that Cmpd-43 inhibits
PRL1-mediated cellular signaling as well as cell proliferation and
migration by blocking PRL1 trimerization.

molecule per asymmetric unit. Remarkably, although a homotrimeric arrangement was always observed in previous crystal
structures of wild-type PRL1 (43, 44), the PRL1/C104S mutant
in complex with sulfate in the active site (44), and PRL1 in
complex with a peptide ligand (10), the PRL1 Analog-3 complex crystallized as a monomer. The overall structure of
PRL1 Analog-3 is quite similar to the initial search model used
for molecular replacement. PRL1 adopts a compact a þ b
structure comprising a central ﬁve-stranded b sheet surrounded
by four a helixes on one side and two a helixes on the other
side (Fig. 4A). The PTP signature motif (C104VAGLGR110) forms
a loop (P-loop) between b5 and a4 located at the base of the
active site pocket. The binding site for Analog-3 is situated at
the backside of the PRL1 active site, which is deﬁned by residues
within the a5 helix, a4–a5 loop, b1–b2 hairpin, and the
C-terminus (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, residues involved in binding Analog-3 come from both the BC- and BA-dimer interfaces
in the resolved complex crystal structure, with the majority of
the contact area in the BC interface (Fig. 4B).
Figure 4C shows the detailed interactions between PRL1 and
Analog-3. The dimethyl-isoindoline moiety is placed within a
hydrophobic pocket deﬁned by Tyr14, Met124, Phe132, and the
aliphatic carbon atoms in Asp128. Speciﬁcally, the two methyl
groups interact with Asp128 and Phe132 respectively, whereas the
isoindoline moiety makes contacts with Tyr14, Met124, and
Phe132. The adjacent benzohydrazide motif has several van der
Waals contacts with residues Thr13, Tyr14, and Lys15, and the
oxygen atom provides an additional polar interaction with terminal amine of Lys15. The furan ring extends into a cavity
constituted by Lys15, Asn16, and Arg159, making van der Waals

interactions with these residues as well as a polar interaction
between the oxygen atom and the side chain of Asn16.
To further substantiate the molecular interactions between
PRL1 and Analog-3, we mutated Tyr14 and Phe132, which have
strong hydrophobic contacts with Analog-3 (Fig. 4C). Analyses of
the buried surface area in the dimer interfaces indicated that these
two residues make very limited, if any, contribution to PRL1
trimerization. Thus, we predicted that substitutions at Tyr14 and
Phe132 would weaken the interaction between PRL1 and Analog3/Cmpd-43, without interference with PRL1 trimerization. As
expected, replacement of Tyr14 and Phe132 by an Ala had no
effect on PRL1 trimerization and PRL1-mediated cell migration
(Fig. 4D and E). Importantly, the PRL1/Y14A and PRL1/F132A
mutants were resistant to Cmpd-43 treatment. Indeed, although
Cmpd-43 blocked wild-type PRL1 trimerization and PRL1-mediated cell migration, it failed to inhibit PRL1/Y14A and PRL1/
F132A trimer formation and had little effect on PRL1/Y14A- or
PRL1/F132A-mediated cell migration (Fig. 4D and E). These
results are in complete agreement with the structural observations
that residues Tyr14 and Phe132 are involved in binding Analog-3.
Taken together, the structural and mutagenesis data provide direct
evidence that Analog-3 and Cmpd-43 bind at the PRL1 trimer
interface and prevents PRL1 trimerization.
PRL1 detrimerizer Cmpd-43 exhibits anticancer activity
As mentioned in the introduction, PRLs are overexpressed in
many tumor cell lines. To investigate the clinical relevance of PRL
overexpression and tumor progression, we analyzed the Gene
Expression across Normal and Tumor tissue (GENT) database, a
publicly available microarray dataset containing more than
34,000 human cancer and normal samples (48). We found that
samples from melanoma patients (n ¼ 302) had signiﬁcantly
higher PRL1 and PRL2 mRNA expression compared to normal

skin samples (n ¼ 141; Fig. 5A and B). To further evaluate the
signiﬁcance of PRL1 overexpression in predicting survival in
patients with melanoma, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) skin cutaneous melanoma dataset. Consistent with the
oncogenic role of PRL1 in human melanoma samples, patients
with high PRL1 mRNA expression had signiﬁcantly decreased
survival (n ¼ 53, median survival ¼ 72.8 months) compared with
those with low PRL1 mRNA expression in the melanoma (n ¼ 57,
median survival ¼ 362.3 months), with an HR of 0.46 (95%
conﬁdence interval of ratio ¼ 0.24 to 0.88, P ¼ 0.019; Fig. 5C).
These clinical data suggest that inhibition of PRL1 could be
beneﬁcial for melanoma treatment. Thus, we hypothesized that
the PRL1 detrimerizer Cmpd-43 may exhibit antimelanoma
activity, possibly via downregulating the activity of both ERK1/
2 and Akt pathways. To directly test this hypothesis, we examined
whether Cmpd-43 could suppress human melanoma MeWo cell
growth and motility. As shown in Fig. 5D, Cmpd-43 dose-dependently decreased MeWo cell proliferation as measured by the
MTT assay. Live-cell tracking was used to measure the motility of
MeWo cells in the presence of Cmpd-43. As shown in Fig. 5E, the
total distance traveled over 6 hours for Cmpd-43 treated MeWo
cells was signiﬁcantly less than that of the control cells. To
determine whether Cmpd-43 preferentially inhibits cancer cell
growth, we treated both mammary carcinoma cell line MCF7 and
normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A with Cmpd-43. As
observed with MeWo cells, Cmpd-43 dose-dependently suppressed the growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells, but the inhibitory
effect of Cmpd-43 was signiﬁcantly compromised towards nontumorigenic MCF10A cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In addition,
the antiproliferative activity of Cmpd-43 to MEF cells was also
signiﬁcantly reduced when compared to the MeWo cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These data indicate that Cmpd-43 displays
signiﬁcantly lower cell toxicity toward normal cells.

Importantly, Cmpd-43 treatment dose-dependently reduced
HGF-induced ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5F). To
make certain that the effect of Cmpd-43 in MeWo cells is also
mediated by blocking PRL1 trimerization, we overexpressed
either wild-type PRL1 or the trimerization deﬁcient mutant
PRL1/G97R mutant in MeWo cells. Similar to what we observed
in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3E), we found that overexpression of PRL1
but not PRL1/G97R signiﬁcantly enhanced both ERK1/2 and Akt
phosphorylation by about 2-fold (Fig. 5G). More importantly,
Cmpd-43 but not Analog-1 suppressed PRL1-induced ERK1/2
and Akt activation. However, neither Cmpd-43 nor Analog-1 were
able to reduce pERK1/2 and pAkt levels in PRL1/G97R expressing
MeWo cells (Fig. 5G), suggesting that Cmpd-43 inhibits PRL1induced ERK1/2 and Akt activation in MeWo cells by blocking
PRL1 trimerization.
The PRL1 crystal structure revealed that residues at the trimer
interface are conserved among all three PRLs (44, Supplementary
Fig. S3A). We previously showed that like PRL1, PRL3 could also
form trimer in solution and inside the cells (8, 44). Amino acid
sequence alignment shows that key residues involved in Analog-3
binding are also highly conserved among all three PRLs (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Therefore, we hypothesized that trimerization
is a general property for all PRLs and Cmpd-43 should inhibit
trimerization of all PRLs. Indeed, both PRL2 and PRL3 can form
trimer, and Cmpd-43 but not Analog-1 signiﬁcantly reduces PRL2
and PRL3 trimer formation (Supplementary Fig. S3B).

trimerization in MeWo cells attenuates both the ERK1/2 and Akt
pathway activation and inhibits cell proliferation and motility.
Given the promising activity of Cmpd-43 in cell-based assays,
we next aimed to establish the therapeutic potential of targeting
PRL with Cmpd-43. First, we characterized the pharmacokinetic
properties of Cmpd-43 in mice. Cmpd-43 displayed a very
respectable pharmacokinetic proﬁle in mouse with a plasma
compound exposure Cmax ¼ 0.3 mmol/L and a half-life t1/2 ¼
15.8 hours at a single 20 mg/kg intraperitoneal dosage. We then
assessed the effect of Cmpd-43 on in vivo tumor growth in a mouse
xenograft model using MeWo cells subcutaneously implanted
into immunodeﬁcient NSG mice. Once the tumor volume
reached 200 mm3, we started daily intraperitoneal injection of
either vehicle control or 30 mg/kg Cmpd-43 and monitored the
tumor growth for 3 weeks. Mice treated with Cmpd-43 displayed
reduced tumor growth throughout the experiment compared with
mice treated with vehicle control (Fig. 6A). At 21 days posttreatment, we collected the tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5), and
observed an approximately 62% shrinkage in tumor volume and
approximately 48% reduction in tumor weight (Fig. 6A and B).
Dissection and histologic analyses revealed no apparent toxicity
in major organs when the mice were treated with Cmpd-43 at 30
mg/kg (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). Furthermore, biochemical studies performed in samples isolated from the melanoma tumors revealed substantial reduction in both ERK1/2 and
Akt phosphorylation, upon treatment with Cmpd-43 (Fig. 6C).
Immunohistological analyses of tumor tissues revealed signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in Cmpd43–treated MeWo tumors (Fig. 6D). Taken together, the reduction
in tumor growth correlated with a decrease in ERK1/2 and Akt
activity, validating the on-target activities of Cmpd-43.
In summary, recent studies expose an oncogenic role of PRLs in
many cancers (3–6), raising the possibility that inhibition of these
phosphatases might have broader therapeutic applications in
oncology. Interestingly, the oncogenic potential of PRLs is always
associated with their overexpression, which should increase the
propensity of PRL trimerization inside the cell. Given the functional requirement of PRL trimerization, pharmacologic disrup-

tion of PRL trimerization represents an innovative approach for
the treatment of human cancers with elevated PRL expression. By
targeting the unique, noncatalytic trimerization interfaces that are
unrelated to any other member of the PTP family, such PRL
detrimerizers would be highly speciﬁc to the PRL. Starting from
a sequential structure-based virtual screening strategy, we have
identiﬁed Cmpd-43 and several analogs that are capable of
preventing PRL trimerization. Biochemical and structural analyses
demonstrate that Cmpd-43 and its close analogs directly bind the
PRL1 trimer interface and obstruct PRL1 trimerization. Cmpd-43
also speciﬁcally blocks the PRL-induced cell proliferation and
migration through attenuation of both ERK1/2 and Akt activity.
Importantly, Cmpd-43 exhibits excellent anticancer activity both
in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model of melanoma. The results
not only further validate the importance of trimerization for PRL
function but also support the clinical potential of compounds that
inhibit PRL trimerization. Although additional medicinal chemistry optimization is required, these PRL detrimerizers represent
valuable tools for elucidating PRL signaling and for developing
novel agents for cancer therapy.
