ABSTRACT
HIPK2 is a Y-regulated S/T kinase involved in various cellular processes,
including cell-fate decision during development and DNA damage response. Cisautophosphorylation in the activation-loop and trans-autophosphorylation at several
S/T sites along the protein are required for HIPK2 activation, subcellular localization,
and subsequent posttranslational modifications. The specific function of a few of
these autophosphorylations has been recently clarified; however, most of the sites
found phosphorylated by mass spectrometry in human and/or mouse HIPK2 are
still uncharacterized. In the process of studying HIPK2 in human colorectal cancers,
we identified a mutation (T566P) in a site we previously found autophosphorylated
in mouse Hipk2. Biochemical and functional characterization of this site showed
that compared to wild type (wt) HIPK2, HIPK2-T566P maintains nuclear-speckle
localization and has only a mild reduction in kinase and growth arresting activities
upon overexpression. Next, we assessed cell response following UV-irradiation
or treatment with doxorubicin, two well-known HIPK2 activators, by evaluating
cell number and viability, p53-Ser46 phosphorylation, p21 induction, and caspase
cleavage. Interestingly, cells expressing HIPK2-T566P mutant did not respond to
UV-irradiation, while behaved similarly to wt HIPK2 upon doxorubicin-treatment.
Evaluation of HIPK2-T566 phosphorylation status by a T566-phospho-specific antibody
showed constitutive phosphorylation in unstressed cells, which was maintained after
doxorubicin-treatment but inhibited by UV-irradiation. Taken together, these data
show that HIPK2-T566 phosphorylation contributes to UV-induced HIPK2 activity but
it is dispensable for doxorubicin response.

In physiological conditions, HIPK2 localizes
mainly in nuclear speckles, including PML-bodies,
and only a small fraction is found in the nucleoplasm
or cytosol [5]. In unstressed cells, HIPK2 is constantly
degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system [6]. In
stressing conditions, such as in response to UV, ionizing
radiation, and chemotherapeutic drugs, HIPK2 stability
is regulated by different ubiquitin E3 ligases [6–10]
and induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis through p53-

INTRODUCTION
HIPK2 (Homeodomain-Interacting Protein Kinase
2) is an evolutionarily conserved tyrosine-regulated
serine/threonine kinase. HIPK2 phosphorylates a large
body of proteins belonging to different signaling pathways
involved in the control of development, cell response to
DNA damage and hypoxia, differentiation, and cytokinesis
[reviewed in 1-4].

dependent and -independent mechanisms [11–15]. In
addition to ubiquitylation, HIPK2 is regulated by different
posttranslational modifications (PTMs), caspase cleavage
[16], and by the interaction with scaffold proteins [9, 17].
Of relevance, HIPK2 PTMs have been shown to occur in a
hierarchical fashion, with phosphorylation being required
for sumoylation, and the latter controlling acetylation
[4, 18].
Thus far, different RefSeqs have been used for
HIPK2 aminoacid numbering. Here, we will refer
to the current NCBI RefSeq (i.e., NP_073577.3 and
NP_034563.2 for human and mouse HIPK2, respectively)
and, when required, add in brackets the aminoacid number
used in the relative references. Both human and mouse
HIPK2 have been shown to become catalytically active
by their cis-autophosphorylation of the activation loop
at Y361 (Y354) and S364 (S357) [19–21]. Of relevance,
the cis-autophosphorylation also controls the subcellular
localization of HIPK2 and its substrate affinity [19–
21]. Subsequent HIPK2 phosphorylations take place
at multiple sites (>40 sites pooling current mouse and
human data) distributed throughout the different HIPK2
domains both by trans-autophosphorylation at S/T sites
and phosphorylation by other, mostly unknown kinases,
in S/T and Y sites (Table 1). The functional consequences
of a few of these phosphorylations are becoming
clear. For example, in DNA damage response (DDR),
HIPK2 activation and accumulation is induced by its
autophosphorylation at T880/S882 that creates a binding
signal for the phospho-specific isomerase Pin1 [22], or by
c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation at Y367 (Y360) [23]. An
inhibitory phosphorylation of HIPK2 by AMPKα2 at T119
(T112), S121 (S114), and T1114 (T1107) has been shown
to release WIP1, a homeostatic regulator of DDR, from
the HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation and degradation
[24]. More recently, HIPK2 phosphorylation at S359/
T360 in the activation loop has been causally linked to ER
stress-mediated neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis [25]. In contrast, substitutions of the putative
S/T phosphorylation sites at position S118 (S111), S121
(S114), S441 (S434), T450 (T443), and T517 (T510)
with non-phosphorylatable alanine did not reduce HIPK2
kinase activity in in vitro assays [19].
HIPK2 dysregulation has been shown to contribute
to proliferative diseases, such as cancer and tissue fibrosis
[2, 26–28]. Based on our current knowledge, three possible
mechanisms explaining the functional inactivation of
HIPK2 have been proposed: the “localization model”, the
“optimum model”, and the “PTM model” which foresee,
respectively, tight regulations of HIPK2 subcellular
localization, protein levels, and PTMs [18]. Mutations in
the HIPK2 gene are sporadic in human cancers (Catalogue
of somatic mutations in cancer - COSMIC http://cancer.
sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) and their contribution to HIPK2
dysregulation has only been rarely verified [29]. By wholeexome sequencing of patient-derived colorectal cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stem cells (C-CSCs), we identified a mutation (T566P) in
one of the sites we previously found autophosphorylated
in mouse Hipk2 (T599 in ref. 20) (Table 1) [20]. Here,
we investigated the contribution of this site in the HIPK2
activity. We observed an impairment of UV-induced
HIPK2 reaction while the HIPK2-mediated response to
doxorubicin was not affected, indicating the existence of a
DDR-specific phospho-mediated regulation of this kinase.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the frame of an effort directed to profile and
functionally characterize the cancer driving events
affecting a panel of C-CSCs obtained by selective culture
from colorectal tumor specimens [30], whole-exome
sequencing was carried out using genomic DNA from
24 C-CSC lines and patient-matched non-tumor tissues.
Statistics and data output is reported in Supplementary
Table 1. Among the multiple hits identified, two different
somatically acquired missense changes, c.1694A>C
(p.Lys565Thr, K565T hereafter) (line CTSC85) and
c.1696A>C (p.Thr566Pro, T566P hereafter) (line
CTSC47) (Supplementary Figure 1A), affecting HIPK2
were identified. Both residues were almost invariably
conserved among vertebrates and were located in a
highly conserved amino acid stretch (Supplementary
Figure 1B), strongly suggesting a possible functional
impact of both changes. Consistently, both substitutions
were predicted to be damaging by Combined Annotation
Dependent Depletion prediction tool [31]. Of note, H565
had previously shown to be an ubiquitylation site and its
substitution had been shown to reduce Siah1-mediated
degradation in the absence of any appreciable effect on the
catalytic activity of the kinase [6]. On the other hand, T566
was previously recognized as one of the sites undergoing
reversible autophosphorylation in mouse Hipk2, which
suggested a possible role of T566 phosphorylation in
the control/modulation of HIPK2 function, and a direct
impact of the T566P change on perturbing HIPK2 activity
by affecting phosphorylation at T566.
To evaluate whether the T566P amino acid
substitution is relevant for HIPK2 localization and
activity, we first introduced the T566P mutation in an
EGFP-tagged wt HIPK2-expressing vector. Mutation of
the nearby K565 to T, found in C-CSC from a different
patient (Supplementary Figure 1A), was engineered as
control. Transfection of these three vectors (WT, T566P,
and K565T) was performed by electroporation in wt p53
carrying U2OS cells. Mock transfected cells (MOCK) and
cells transfected with the EGFP empty vector (GFP) were
used as control.
HIPK2 mainly localizes into nuclear speckles
and specific PTMs, such as cis-autophosphorylation,
sumoylation, and acetylation can regulate the
localization of the kinase. Thus, we first evaluated the
localization of our GFP-HIPK2 derivatives. As shown

in Figure  1A,  T566P mutant has a nuclear-speckled
localization comparable to that of wt HIPK2 and HIPK2K565T mutant, whereas the GFP control showed a diffuse
nuclear/cytoplasmic localization, as expected.
Next, we evaluated the kinase activity of the
three GFP-HIPK2 derivatives on the kinase its-self, a
non-specific substrate, the myelin basic protein (MBP),
and two specific substrates, p53 and p63, as previously
described [20]. GFP-HIPK2 derivatives overexpressed in
U2OS cells were immunopurified and comparable protein
amounts employed for in vitro kinase assays. Compared to
wt HIPK2 and the ubiquitylation mutant, HIPK2-T566P
mutant showed a very mild reduction of kinase activity on
its-self and on MBP, while no significant difference was
observed in the levels of p53 and p63 phosphorylation
(Figure 1B).
HIPK2-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
requires its kinase activity [11–13]. To verify whether the
mild and partial reduction of the HIPK2-T566P kinase
activity might be relevant for its function, we compared
the survival and proliferation-suppressing activities of
the three GFP-HIPK2 derivatives by EdU (5-ethynyl-2'deoxyuridine) incorporation upon expression in U2OS
cells. A comparable, early and mild induction of cell death
was observed among the cell populations transduced with
the three EGFP-HIPK2 derivatives (4±0.5%, 6±0.6%,
and 9±0.8% for WT, T566P, and K565T, respectively).
Single-cell analyses for EdU incorporation and staining
of GFP-positive, transfected cells, and GFP-negative,
untransfected cells in the same dish showed a significant
inhibition of EdU positivity in the wt HIPK2 and HIPK2K565T expressing cells compared to relative GFP-

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

negative cells. In contrast, the HIPK2-T566P mutant
was consistently less efficient in suppressing EdU
incorporation (Figure 1C). Overall, these data documented
that mutation of the autophosphorylation HIPK2-T566 site
in HIPK2 does not affect the nuclear speckle localization
of the kinase but might contribute to its proliferationsuppressing activity.
Exogenous HIPK2 overexpression is thought to
mirror HIPK2 activity in DDR, while developmental and
cytokinesis functions of HIPK2 are better revealed by lossof-function strategies with rescue experiments in HIPK2defective cells that can be obtained only with very low
expression of the exogenous kinase [32–34]. Thus, based
on our overexpression data, we sought to assess the DDR
activity of the endogenous HIPK2-T566P mutant. The
CTSC47 cells expressing this mutant and carrying wt p53,
as assessed by whole-exome sequencing (Supplementary
Table 2), were treated with UV and doxorubicin
(Adriamycin – ADR), two strong HIPK2 activators whose
activity on HIPK2-defective cells is significantly impaired
[35]. As demonstrated by p53-S46 phosphorylation, p21WAF1 expression, caspase 3-cleavage, and reduction of
cell viability, U2OS control cells and the CTSC1.1 patientderived cells expressing HIPK2 and p53 in the wild-type
form, did respond to both treatments (Figure 2A, left and
right panel) [11, 12]. By contrast, the T566P-expressing
CTSC47 did respond to ADR treatment but did not to
UV-irradiation (Figure 2A, middle panel), suggesting the
existence of an agent-specific impairment.
In response to ADR, DYRK2 was also shown to
phosphorylate p53-S46 [36]. Thus, we asked whether the
preserved response to ADR by the HIPK2-T566P-carrying

CTSC47 cells might be independent of HIPK2 activity.
HIPK2-specific siRNAs were employed to deplete HIPK2
expression in the CTSC47 cells as previously described
[37] (Figure 2B). These primary cells grow as spheroids
and cannot be efficiently transfected. However, the mild

downregulation of HIPK2 was associated to a reduction of
p53-S46 phosphorylation in response to ADR (Figure 2C)
indicating that the HIPK2-T566P mutant does contribute
to ADR-induced p53 activation. Together, the results we
obtained on the endogenous HIPK2 suggest a differential

role for the HIPK2-T566 site in cell response to UV and
ADR.
Our previous data by liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on mouse Hipk2 showed
that Hipk2-T566 (T559) is an autophosphorylation site and
its phosphorylation is lost in the catalytic-impaired K228R
(K221R) and Y361F (Y354) mutants [20 and unpublished
results]. T566 was not found phosphorylated in the human
HIPK2 by the same analyses [19]. Since negative results by
LC-MS/MS do not necessarily indicate the absence of the
event and our in silico and functional analyses supported
the relevance of the T566P substitution, we developed a
T566-phospho-specific Ab (see Materials and Methods)
to evaluate the contribution of this phospho-site to UVand ADR-induced DDR. As shown in Figure 3A, the anti-

p-HIPK2 (T566) Ab was demonstrated to immunoreact
with human wt HIPK2 while it did not recognize the
non-phosphorylatable HIPK2-T566P mutant. In addition,
treatment with alkaline phosphatase significantly reduced
Ab immunoreactivity, further supporting the Ab specificity
and confirming the occurrence of phosphorylation at
T566 in the kinase. Next, we employed this Ab to assess
HIPK2-T566 phosphorylation in UV- and ADR-induced
DDR. U2OS cells expressing the GFP-tagged wt HIPK2
were UV-irradiated or treated with ADR. Untreated cells
were used as control. As for other HIPK2 S/T sites, we
found that HIPK2-T566 was constitutively phosphorylated
in the untreated cells (Figure 3B). Interestingly, UVirradiation was associated with dephosphorylation at
T566, while ADR-treatment did not modify the T566

Figure 3: HIPK2-T566 phosphorylation analysis. A. U2OS cells were transfected with the indicated GFP-tagged vectors and total

cell extracts analyzed by WB before and after phosphatase (CIAP) treatment. The anti-p-HIPK2 (T566) Ab recognizes the WT protein but
not the non-phosphorylatable HIPK2-T566P mutant and gives a strongly reduced signal in the dephosphorylated WT sample. The amount
of GFP-tagged HIPK2 proteins (WT and T566P) was detected by anti-GFP Ab. GAPDH was used as loading control. B. U2OS cells were
transfected with the GFP-tagged wt HIPK2 and irradiated with UV (50 and 150 J/m2) or treated with ADR (0.6 and 3 μM). Non-treated
(NT) cells were used as control. Total cell extracts were prepared 24 hrs post-treatments and analyzed by WB for the indicated total and
phosphorylated proteins.

phosphorylation status (Figure 3B), though, as expected
for a wt HIPK2, both treatments resulted in a comparable
p53 phosphorylation at S46, supporting a differential
contribution of the HIPK2-T566 phosphorylation status
in the UV- and ADR-induced HIPK2 activation.
To verify this differential contribution, U2OS cells
were transfected with GFP-tagged wt HIPK2 or the T566P
mutant; the GFP-empty vector was transfected as negative
control. The three transfected populations were treated
with ADR, UV-irradiated, or maintained in non-treated
conditions. As expected from the above reported data
(Figure 1C), EdU incorporation was reduced by exogenous
wt HIPK2 expression and, to a lesser extent, by the T566P
mutant (Figure 4, NT bars). ADR-treatment resulted in a
comparable, further reduction of EdU incorporation in both
wt HIPK2 and HIPK2-T566P expressing cells (Figure 4,
ADR bars). In contrast, UV-irradiation further reduced EdU
incorporation only in the wt HIPK2 expressing cells, while
those expressing the T566P mutant behaved as the GFPcontrol cells (Figure 4, UV bars). These results strongly
support the conclusion that the phosphorylation at T566
contributes to UV-mediated reaction of HIPK2 but it is
dispensable for the doxorubicin-induced response of the

kinase. Taken together, these data show, for the first time,
that different genotoxic agents may activate HIPK2 by
diversely modulating its autophosphorylation at a single site.
The involvement of HIPK2 in a multitude of
biological processes and its participation in many different
signaling pathways is made possible by PTMs that increase
its functional diversity. In this light, the finding that a
specific HIPK2 autophosphorylation site, T566, diversely
contributes to UV- and doxorubicin-mediated DDR may
not be surprising. However, thus far, HIPK2 activation and
function has been indiscriminately studied upon UV, IR or
chemotherapeutic drug treatments. For example, HIPK2
autophosphorylation at T880/S882 and Pin1 binding have
been studied upon doxorubicin treatment [22]; c-Ablmediated phosphorylation at Y367 upon UV and IR [23];
AMPKα2-mediated phosphorylation at T119, S121, and
T1114 upon IR [24]. While generalizations of these results
are usually not specifically claimed, we should be aware
that the common definition of HIPK2 activation in DDR
implies at least diverse phosphorylation states. This should
prompt us to expend more effort in developing tools for
studying the endogenous protein in both physiological and
pathological conditions.

proliferation was assessed by EdU-incorporation and subsequent detection by fluorescence. Data represent the mean ± SE of at least three
different experiments. * P<0.05; ** P<0.001; NS P>0.05 by Student t test.

HIPK2-fw: ggctgaccggcgggagtt; HIPK2-rev:
ggtcaggccgggcacaaatct.
PCR-amplifications were performed in duplicate on
two different RNA preparations.

Whole-exome sequencing and data analysis
Target enrichment was performed using in-solution
technology (NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Library v.3.0,
Roche), and the resulting target libraries were sequenced
by Illumina sequencing technology (HiSeq2000). Raw
image files were processed by Illumina basecalling
software (CASAVA 1.7) using default parameters. Pairedend reads were aligned to the human genome (UCSC
GRCh37/hg19) with the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA
v. 0.7.10) [38]. Presumed PCR duplicates were removed
using Picard's MarkDuplicates. The Genome Analysis
Toolkit (GATK 3.3) [39] was used for realignment of
sequences encompassing indels and for base quality
recalibration. Somatic single-nucleotide variants were
detected using Mutect software v.1.1.6 [40] and small
indels were identified through a comparison between
indels called in individual C-CSC lines and their matched
nontumoral samples by means of the GATK Haplotype
Caller algorithm [41], as previously described [42, 43].
The resulting SNVs and small indels were annotated
by SnpEff v3.6 [44] and dbNSFP2.8 [45] in terms of
functional impact of variants [46, 47]. Variant validation
and genotyping were performed by direct sequencing
using the ABI BigDye Terminator Sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems) and an ABI3500 capillary sequencer (Applied
Biosystems).

HIPK2 expression vectors and cell transfection
The pEGFP-HIPK2-FL vector, encoding for a
N-terminal GFP-tagged wild type HIPK2-FL protein
[37] was mutagenized by QuickChange II Site-Direct
Mutagenesis kit (Agilent) with the following primers:
T566P: cacggtgaaccagagcaaaccccctttcatcac;
K565T: acggtgaaccagagcacaacccctttcatcacg.
The
obtained
pEGFP-HIPK2-T566P
and
pEGFP-HIPK2-K565T vectors were validated by
direct sequencing and transfected in U2OS cells by
electroporation (0.2 kV, 950 μF) using a Gene Pulser
(Bio-Rad) or by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

In vitro kinase assay
Recombinant GFP-HIPK2, GFP-K565T and GFPT566P were produced in U2OS cells by transfection
with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Total cell extracts were
prepared 24 hrs post-transfection by incubation for 30
min at 4°C in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
300 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5mM EDTA, protease
and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche)]. When required, to
reduce protein phosphorylation, the total cell extracts
were incubated at 30°C for 30 min in the presence of 20
U/ml calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). After
centrifugation, GFP-fusion proteins were purified from
supernatant by overnight incubation with anti-GFP Absepharose beads (Abcam) at 4°C and used as enzymatic
source. Western blot (WB) analysis with a different antiGFP Ab (mouse monoclonal anti-GFP Ab, Roche) was
employed to quantify purified proteins. For kinase assay,
recombinant proteins were incubated with recombinant
p53, p63, and MBP for 30 min at 30°C in a kinase
buffer in the presence of [γ32P]-ATP, as described [15].
The phosphorylated substrates were resolved on precast
NuPAGE 4-12% gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
analyzed by autoradiography.

Cells culture and RNA interference
The human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS
and antibiotics (Invitrogen). The patient-derived colon
spheroids were kindly provided by Prof R. De Maria and
cultured in a serum-free medium supplemented with 20
ng/ml EGF and 10 ng/ml FGF-2 (PrePro –Tech) [48]. For
DDR, subconfluent cells were irradiated with UV-B using
a Vilbert Lourmat Irradiator or incubated in the presence
of doxorubicin (Adriamycin; Sigma).
RNA interference was obtained by HIPK2-specific
Stealth RNAi sequences and Stealth RNAi-negative
control (UNC) (Invitrogen), as previously described [37].
Cells were transfected by RNAi-MAX Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions and
BLOCK-iT Red Fluorescent oligo (Invitrogen) was used
to measure RNA transfection efficiency.

Western blotting and antibodies
A rabbit polyclonal Ab recognizing the
phosphorylated HIPK2-T566 site, anti-p-HIPK2 (Thr566)
Ab was raised against a phospho-peptide representing
the human HIPK2 region surrounding T566 and affinity
purified with the immunizing phosphorylated peptide
after negative absorption with the non-phosphorylated
peptide. Peptide design, Ab production and purification
were all performed by the custom antibody service of
Thermofisher.

RT–PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini Kit
(Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using a M-MLTV RTase
and amplified with GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega).
The following primers were employed (NCBI RefSeq
NM_022740.4):

Total cell extracts were prepared, separated,
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and
immunodecorated as described [37]. The following,
additional Abs were employed: anti-GFP (mouse
monoclonals, clones 7.1 and 13.1 - Roche), anti-p53 (mouse
monoclonal: clone DO-1 - Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-p-p53(Ser46) (rabbit polyclonal - Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-p21 (mouse polyclonal - Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-p-p53(Ser15) (rabbit polyclonal
- Cell Signaling Technology), anti-cleaved caspase-3
(rabbit polyclonal - Cell Signaling Technology), anti-αtubulin (mouse monoclonal, clone TU-01 - Immunological
Science), anti-GAPDH (mouse monoclonal, clone 6C5
- Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following incubation for 1
hr at room temperature with secondary antibodies, antiHRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse and goat-anti-rabbit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories), bound Abs were reviled by ECLWB Detection System (GE Healthcare) and analyzed by
chemiluminescence imaging system (UVITEC Cambridge).
