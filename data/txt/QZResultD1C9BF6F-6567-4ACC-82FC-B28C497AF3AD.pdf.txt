ABSTRACT
Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β (GSK3β) is a serine/threonine kinase, known to
regulate various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival,
apoptosis as well as TRAIL-resistance. Thus pathways that can modulate GSK3β axis
are important targets for cancer drug development. Our earlier studies have shown
that combinatorial treatment with Troglitazone (TZD) and TRAIL can induce apoptosis
in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. The current studies were undertaken to investigate
whether GSK3β pathway was modulated during this apoptosis. Our results indicated
an increase in inhibitory GSK3βSer9 phosphorylation during apoptosis, mediated via
AKT. At a later time, however, TZD alone and TRAIL-TZD combination produced a
dramatic reduction of GSK3β expression, which was abolished by cycloheximide.
Luciferase assays with GSK3β-luc promoter reporter showed that TZD can effectively
antagonize GSK3β promoter activity. Since TZD is a ligand for transcription factor
PPARγ and can activate AMPK, we determined their roles on antagonism of GSK3β.
Knockdown of PPARγ was unable to restore GSK3β expression or antagonize GSK3βSer9
phosphorylation. Although pretreatment with Compound C (pharmacological inhibitor
of AMPK) partially rescued GSK3β expression, knockdown of AMPKα1 or α2 alone
or in combination were ineffective. These studies suggested a novel PPARγ-AMPKindependent mechanism of targeting GSK3β by TZD, elucidation of which might
provide newer insights to improve our understanding of TRAIL-resistance.

INTRODUCTION

in neurodegeneration, the efficacy of GSK3 inhibitors
in Alzheimer’s disease have also been tested [4]. GSK3
is known to phosphorylate and regulate the activities of
more than 40 proteins, many of which are transcription
factors [5]. This indicates the potential contribution of this
enzyme in regulating a variety of cellular functions. The
regulation of GSK3β activity is not completely understood
and is believed to be mediated via a combination of
phosphorylation, localization and interaction with other
proteins [6, 7]. The major inhibitory phosphorylation is
on Ser9 of GSK3β and Ser21 of GSK3α [8, 9] and can
be phosphorylated by multiple upstream kinases including
AKT [10].
In the cancer field, GSK-3β is commonly recognized
as a putative tumor suppressor due to its well-established
function as a repressor of β-catenin signaling [11] and

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a
multifunctional serine/threonine kinase that has
been implicated in regulating several fundamental
processes including cell proliferation, differentiation,
metabolism, survival and apoptosis [1], as well as various
pathological conditions such as diabetes, oncogenesis
and neurological diseases [2]. GSK3 derived its name
from its phosphorylation activity toward glycogen
synthase, thus linking it to glycogen metabolism. Since
then, increasing research on GSK3 has significantly
improved our understanding of this molecule. Two GSK3 genes (α and β) have been cloned in mammals with
strong sequence conservation within the catalytic domain
between the homologues [3]. Due to its profound role

phosphorylation-dependent down-regulation of cellcycle regulators cyclin D1 [12], cdc25 [13], and c-Myc
[14]. Paradoxically, it can also promote cell survival and
oppose apoptosis [15, 16]. An involvement of GSK3β in
mediating tumorigenic pathways is also indicated by its
induced expression in various cancers including colon
cancer [17], pancreatic cancer [18, 19], prostate cancer
[20–22], and glioblastoma [23]. This notion is supported
by recent studies suggesting an involvement of

levels were compared. Although total GSK3β expression
was unaffected initially, prolonged treatment with
TRAIL-TZD resulted in a significant reduction of total
GSK3β expression in both cell types (Figure 1A, 1B
24 hrs). Reduction of total GSK3α, however was more
modest. Similar regulation of GSK3β in both LNCaP
(AR dependent) and DU145 (AR independent) cells
suggested that this might be occurring independent of
AR signaling. In addition, we also observed an increase
of pGSK3βSer9 levels, which preceded reduction of total
GSK3β and coincided with the period of active apoptosis
(Figure 1B). The concentrations of both TRAIL and TZD
needed to inhibit total GSK3β expression optimally were
determined next. These studies designed with increasing
concentrations of each agent indicated that combination
of 100  ng/ml TRAIL and 50–100  µM TZD produced
maximal effects on total GSK3β expression (Figure 1C).
Thus the remaining studies were carried out with this
combination.
In order to determine whether this regulation of
GSK3β is also present in other cancer cells, we determined
the changes in GSK3β levels in hepatocellular carcinoma
cells (Huh7) and pancreatic cancer cells (BXPC3). These
also showed a dramatic reduction of total GSK3β and
α expressions in Huh7 cells following treatment with
TRAIL-TZD combination (Figure 2A). A similar time
dependent reduction of total GSK3β and α was also
observed in the BXPC3 cells (Figure 2B). These were
also associated with an initial increase in the levels of
pGSK3βSer9 in both cell types. These suggested that
TRAIL-TZD-induced modulation of GSK3β pathway is
present in various cancer cells and is a generalized event.

GSK3β in pancreatic cancer cell survival [24],
dedifferentiation [19] as well as therapeutic
resistance [25–27]. Similarly, GSK3β inhibition was
shown to ameliorate apoptosis resistance in other
types of cancer as well [28, 29]. A close connection
of GSK3β in prostate cancer has been demonstrated
earlier by the fact that increased cytoplasmic GSK3β
correlated with the clinical stage and Gleason score
in prostate tumor samples [30]. In addition, GSK3β
was shown to positively regulate androgen receptor
(AR) function [31, 20] and nuclear translocation
[32]. An understanding of how GSK3β pathway is

modulated during apoptotic signaling is thus important
for the development of new and effective therapeutic
approaches that can target GSK3β.
In recent studies with TRAIL-resistant cancer cells,
we have observed that treatment with a combination of
TRAIL and PPARγ ligand Troglitazone (TZD) induces
profound apoptosis compared to either agent alone [33].
The aim of the present study was to determine whether
GSK3β pathway was modulated by this combination
treatment and to elucidate the potential mechanism. Our
results indicate that in TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, TRAIL and
TZD treatment resulted in an induction of GSK3βSer9
phosphorylation (indicating inhibition) at an earlier
stage during apoptosis. In addition, total GSK3β levels
were significantly down-regulated by TZD alone and by
TRAIL-TZD combination at a later stage that involved
inhibition of transcription. This downregulation of GSK3β
involved mechanisms independent of PPARγ and AMPK.
In addition, although pharmacological inhibition was
ineffective, knockdown of GSK3α and to a lesser extent
GSK3β seemed to promote apoptosis when treated with
TRAIL-TZD combination.	

Comparison of the effects of TRAIL and TZD
alone or in combination in antagonizing GSK3β
To understand the relative contribution of TRAIL
or TZD alone and their combination in modulating total
GSK3β expression, cells were treated with either agent
alone or in combination and the effect on GSK3β levels
was estimated. These studies indicated that treatment
with TZD alone resulted in a significant attenuation of
total GSK3β expression, which was further potentiated by
TRAIL-TZD combination (Figure 3A, 3B). Antagonism
of GSK3β axis by TZD and TRAIL-TZD was also evident
from the reduction of GSK3β downstream target Glycogen
Synthase Ser641 phosphorylation (Figure 3B, pGSSer641
panel). To determine whether TRAIL-TZD induced any
change in GSK3β localization, Immunofluorescence
studies were designed. These showed that treatment
with TZD alone or in combination with TRAIL
significantly reduced cytoplasmic and nuclear GSK3β
levels (Figure 3C). These suggested TZD to be a major
modulator of GSK3β expression.

RESULTS
Combination treatment with TRAIL-TZD
attenuates GSK3β pathway in cancer cells
To understand the status of GSK3β pathway
during apoptosis following treatment with TRAILTZD combination, prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and
DU145) were treated with TRAIL-TZD combination

TZD inhibits total GSK3β at a transcriptional
level

To confirm any transcriptional regulation of GSK3β,
we performed luciferase assays with GSK3β-promoter
luciferase construct pGL3-GSK-3β-luc (–427/+66)
[34] following treatment with TZD. These showed a
significant attenuation of GSK3β promoter activity with
TZD treatment in both LNCaP and DU145 cells in a time
dependent manner (Figure 4B and 4C), suggesting that
TZD can inhibit GSK3β transcription.

In an attempt to understand the mechanism how
TZD regulates total GSK3β, studies were undertaken to
determine whether the effects were at a post-translational
level. Pretreatment with protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide (CHX) showed that although TZD reduced
total GSK3β expression significantly in the absence of
CHX (Figure 4A, compare lanes 1&3), it was unable to
do so in the presence of CHX (compare lanes 5&7). These
suggested that TZD attenuated total GSK3β levels not at
a post-translational step and most likely regulated it at a
transcriptional level or via modulating mRNA stability.

TZD-induced attenuation of GSK-3β is PPARγindependent
Since TZD is a ligand for transcription factor
PPARγ, and GSK3β was regulated at a transcriptional

TZD-induced attenuation of GSK-3β is
modulated by compound C independent of
AMPK

level by TZD, we determined next whether PPARγ played
any role in modulating GSK3β expression. To understand
the role of PPARγ on GSK3β expression, endogenous
PPARγ expression was knocked down using the smart
pool hPPARγ-siRNA from Dharmacon. PPARγ-siRNA
reduced PPARγ expression significantly (Figure 5A, 5B,
PPARγ-siRNA lanes), but was unable to antagonize
TZD or TRAIL-TZD-induced reduction of total GSK3β
expression (Figure 5B, compare lanes 3&4 with 7&8).
These studies also revealed that, TRAIL-TZD-mediated
induction of pGSK3βSer9 was independent of PPARγ
(Figure 5A).

In recent studies we have demonstrated that TRAIL
and TZD-combination can induce apoptosis in prostate
cancer cells involving AMPK pathway [35]. Since TZD
can also activate AMPK [36, 37], we determined any role
of AMPK in attenuating GSK3β pathway by pretreating
the cells with Compound C (a known inhibitor of
AMPK), prior to TRAIL-TZD treatment. These results
showed that TRAIL-TZD-induced attenuation of total

GSK3β expression at 24 hrs can be partially antagonized
by Compound C pretreatment in both Huh7 and DU145
cells (Figure 6A, 6B, compare lanes 5, 6 and 7, 8, GSK3β
panel). Compound C also inhibited pACCSer79 (AMPK
downstream target) in both cell types (Figure 6A, 6B),
indicating the efficacy of the inhibitor. This suggested
a potential involvement of AMPK in mediating total

GSK3β reduction. To confirm the participation of AMPK
in mediating these effects, we determined the effect of
TRAIL-TZD on GSK3β expression following knockdown
of AMPKα. Surprisingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of
AMPKα1 or α2 alone was unable to antagonize TZD or
TRAIL-TZD-induced attenuation of GSK3β expression
(Figure 7A, compare lanes 2, 5 & 8 and lanes 3, 6 & 9).

endogenous GSK3β (green fluorescence). The nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). The images were captured on a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti
microscope, equipped with a digital camera (Nikon DS-Qi2) at 40× magnification.

Knocking down AMPKα1 or α2 in combination also
showed no effect in any of the cell types (Figure 7B,
compare lanes 2, 4, 6 & 8). These suggested that GSK3β
expression was regulated via a Compound C sensitive but
AMPK-independent mechanism.
In these experiments we also observed that
Compound C pretreatment was unable to antagonize
TRAIL-TZD-induction of pGSK3βSer9 levels and
rather showed minor induction, and a corresponding
hyper-activation of AKT (Figure 6A, pGSK3βSer9 and
pAKTSer473 panels, compare lanes 2 & 4). To determine
whether PI3Kinase and AKT was mediating GSK3βSer9
phosphorylation in TRAIL-TZD pathway, cells were
pretreated with either the PI3Kinase inhibitor (LY294002)
or the AKT inhibitor (AKT inhibitor VIII) followed
by TRAIL-TZD treatment. LY294002 significantly
antagonized basal and TRAIL-TZD-induced GSK3βSer9
phosphorylation levels which was fully antagonized by
AKT inhibitor VIII (Figure 6C, compare lanes 2, 4 & 6,

pGSK3βSer9 panel). pAKTSer473 or pAKT2Ser474 levels
were completely abolished by LY294002, suggesting
its efficacy in antagonizing PI3Kinase activation. These
interesting results suggested that TRAIL-TZD likely
increases GSK3βSer9 phosphorylation via a mechanism that
involves AKT and upstream PI3Kinase pathways.

Effect of GSK-3β inhibition on TRAIL-TZDinduced apoptosis
To understand whether antagonism of GSK3β was
necessary to promote apoptosis, cells were pretreated
with pharmacological inhibitors of GSK3β followed by
treatment with TRAIL or TRAIL-TZD. Pretreatment with
CHIR 99021, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β [38] produced
no significant increase on TRAIL or TRAIL-TZD-induced
apoptosis after 8  hrs or 16  hrs of treatment (Figure 8A
and 8B). CHIR 99021, however, inhibited pGSSer641 levels,
suggesting its efficacy in inhibiting GSK3β activity.

50 µg/ml Cycloheximide (CHX) for 48 hrs and then with DMSO or TRAIL, TZD alone or in combination for an additional 24 hrs. At the
end of incubation, cells were harvested and equal amounts of total protein were analyzed by Western Blots with the antibodies indicated.

and β-galactosidase assays were carried out next and RLU/β-Gal values were expressed as % control. The data in each set represent the
mean ± SD of three independent experiments.

Similar results were obtained with two other inhibitors,
GSK3β inhibitor VIII and Kenpaullone (Supplementary
Figure S1 and S2). To confirm the role of GSK3β in
mediating apoptosis or resistance, GSK3β or GSK3α was
knocked down first followed by treatment with TRAIL or
TRAIL-TZD. Knockdown of GSK3α and to a lesser extent
GSK3β seemed to increase TRAIL-TZD-induced Caspase
3 and PARP cleavage, (Figure 8C, compare lanes 3, 6
& 9). On the other hand, TRAIL-induced Caspase 3 and
PARP cleavage was only marginally increased by GSK3α
knockdown, while knockdown of GSK3β produced no

major effect (compare lanes 2, 5, 8). These suggested that
antagonism of both isoforms are necessary to increase
TRAIL-TZD-induced apoptosis, and GSK3α seems to be
important in TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
The serine/threonine kinase GSK3β plays
important roles in the pathogenesis of a wide variety
of diseases that include neurodegenerative diseases
(e.g. Parkinson’s Disease), inflammatory diseases and

cancer [39–41]. GSK3β expression is known to be
induced in several cancer types, which include colon
cancer [17], pancreatic cancer [18, 19], prostate cancer
[20–22] and glioblastoma [23]. Increasing evidence
points towards a pro-oncogenic role of GSK3β in
various cancer types due to its effects in promoting
cell proliferation and survival [17, 42]. Particularly, in
pancreatic cancer cells GSK3β pathway was associated
with increased NFκB activity, increased cancer cell
survival [24], tumor dedifferentiation [19] and tumor
resistance [25, 26]. There is also a strong evidence
supporting a role of GSK3β in prostate cancer where
it is involved in promoting androgen receptor function

and nuclear translocation [20, 31, 32]. In addition,
increased cytoplasmic GSK3β in prostate tumor
samples correlated with the clinical stage and Gleason
score [30]. While all these suggest that targeting
GSK3β might be an important and effective means of
controlling cancer progression, therapeutic options
currently available are limited. This is because majority
of the available pharmacological inhibitors of GSK3β
have limited specificity and also target several other
protein kinases [38].
In an attempt to overcome this limitation of GSK3β
inhibitors, in the current study we aimed at elucidating
the mechanism by which GSK3β expression can be

antagonized in cancer cells. Although TZD-mediated
antagonism of GSK3β was reported earlier [43], those
studies provided limited insight towards the mechanism
involved. Our results show that treatment with a
combination of TRAIL and TZD which induces potent
apoptosis [35], also antagonized the expression of total
GSK3β in various cancer cells. More in depth analysis
showed that TZD alone can significantly attenuate GSK3β
expression, which inhibited total GSK3β via antagonizing
its transcription. Since TZD is a ligand of PPARγ, we
determined whether PPARγ played any role in this
antagonism via designing siRNA-mediated knockdown
experiments. Surprisingly, TZD-induced antagonism
seemed to be PPARγ-independent. This is supported by
several earlier studies that have showed that TZD can

antagonize expression of β-catenin [44], cyclin D1 [45],
c-myc [46] independent of PPARγ. Since TZD is known
to activate AMPK and our earlier studies showed the
involvement of AMPK pathway in TRAIL-TZD-induced
apoptosis, we hypothesized that AMPK might be involved
in regulating GSK3β expression. In fact, pretreatment with
a pharmacological inhibitor of AMPK (Compound C)
was capable of partially reversing the inhibitory effects
of TRAIL-TZD on total GSK3β expression. However,
these effects of Compound C seemed to be AMPKindependent, since knocking down AMPKα1 or α2 alone
or in combination was unable to reverse the expression of
GSK3β in the presence of TRAIL-TZD. Several studies
have reported AMPK-independent effects of Compound
C [47], which seems to involve antagonism of mTOR

To understand whether GSK3β inhibition plays a
major role in mediating TRAIL-TZD-induced apoptosis or
increased TRAIL sensitivity in cancer cells, we pretreated
cells with different pharmacological inhibitors of GSK3βCHIR 99021, GSK3β inhibitor VIII and Kenpaullone
followed by treatment with TRAIL alone or a combination of
TRAIL and TZD. These results showed that these inhibitors
can successfully antagonize GSK3β pathway as indicated by
the corresponding reduction of pGSSer641 levels, but produced
no effect on apoptosis. To validate these, we also studied
the effect of knocking down either GSK3α or GSK3β on
TRAIL or TRAIL-TZD-induced apoptosis. In these studies,

pathway in T cells [48] and multiple mechanisms in
human gliomas [49]. It is unclear who the mediators
are downstream of TZD or TRAIL-TZD that regulate
GSK3β expression in the cancer cells. Earlier studies
by Zhang et al. have shown that mutant K-Ras induces
GSK3β transcription in pancreatic cancer cells via MAPK
involving E-twenty six 2 (ETS2) transcription factor and
p300 histone acetyltransferase [34]. Since TZD is known
to inhibit the ETS pathway [50, 51], it seems possible that
the inhibitory effects of TZD on GSK3β might involve
ETS transcription factors. More molecular approaches are
needed to firmly establish this in TZD-GSK3β axis.

Cell culture

although knocking down GSK3α and to a lesser extent
GSK3β increased TRAIL-TZD-induced caspase 3 and
PARP cleavage (indicating apoptosis), TRAIL-induced
effects were potentiated only by GSK3α knockdown. Similar
observations were also reported by other investigators, where
inhibition of GSK3β in pancreatic cancer cells significantly
inhibited NFκB activity but failed to sensitize to gemcitabine
[18]. In a separate study, Lithium-induced inhibition of
GSK3β antagonized chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
[52]. On the contrary, studies in colon cancer cells showed
that either pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated
knockdown of GSK3β augmented TZD-induced reduction of
NFκB activity, cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction
[43]. The reason behind these discrepancies is not quite clear,
but indicates the complexity of GSK3β pathway which might
be cancer-type specific and needs further analysis. In fact,
GSK3β is known to have a paradoxical role in mediating
intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of cellular apoptosis [53].
Various other studies have shown the involvement of GSK3β
in specific pathways of apoptosis [54, 55, 52]. As described
earlier and in view of multiple cellular effects regulated by
GSK3β, it is unclear at this point which major biological
effects are mediated via inhibition of GSK3β. It remains
a possibility that TZD-mediated antagonism of GSK3β/α
axis might mediate a non-apoptotic form of cell death (or
necroptosis) as was reported by others [56]. Necroptosis is a
form of programmed necrosis that involves death receptors
and specific signal transduction pathways mediated by
receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinases [57, 58]. TZD has
also been shown to be involved in necroptosis [59]. Despite
this complexity, our studies provide a novel insight towards
a pathway in which TZD can antagonize GSK3β expression
and might be effective in targeting those cancers which rely
on GSK3β activity for proliferation and survival.

Human Prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU 145),
pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC3) were obtained from
ATCC and maintained in RPMI (LNCaP, DU 145) and
DMEM (BxPC3) media supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
Human HCC cells (Huh7) were obtained as described
[60] and grown in DMEM/F12 media. In TRAIL and
TZD experiments, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml
TRAIL or 50 μm TZD (unless indicated otherwise) alone
or in combination for various lengths of time followed
by Western blot analysis. In the studies with CHX, the
cells were pretreated with 50 µg/ml of CHX for 48 hrs
followed by TRAIL-TZD for 24  hrs. For the inhibitor
experiments, cells were pretreated for 1 hour or 24 hours
with the respective inhibitors, followed by TRAIL-TZD
treatment for various lengths of time.

Luciferase assays
Sub-confluent populations of cells were transiently
transfected with GSK-3β luciferase promoter pGL3GSK-3β-luc (−427/+66), along with β-galactosidase
vector (to correct for transfection efficiency) utilizing
Lipofectamine-2000 as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. After 24 hours of recovery in the growth
medium, the cells were treated with TRAIL-TZD for
various lengths of time; the cells were harvested after
treatment and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were
performed as described earlier [61]. Each transfection
was performed in triplicate, and each experiment was
repeated at least twice. Luciferase and β-galactosidase
(β-gal) assays were performed using a luminometer
(Berthold Technologies, Centro XS3 LB 960) and a plate
reader (Power Wave XS, Biotek), respectively. The results
obtained were calculated as the ratio of relative light units
(RLU) to β-gal values (RLU/β-gal) and expressed as the
% increase compared with controls.

control siRNA. siRNA transfection was performed using
Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, subconfluent cells plated in 35 mm plates were
transfected with 50 nM of either control siRNA or target
protein-siRNA for 24 h followed by recovery in serum
containing medium. The transfected cells were treated
after 72 hours of transfection with either DMSO or TRAIL
or TZD alone or in combination for various lengths of time
followed by western blot analysis.

REFERENCES

Western blot analysis was performed utilizing
procedures described previously [60, 62]. Briefly, equal
amounts of total cell extracts were fractionated by SDSPAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and subjected to
Western blot analysis utilizing various antibodies.

Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed
as reported earlier [63]. Briefly, Huh7 cells plated in
4-well chamber slides were treated with DMSO, TZD,
or TRAIL alone or in combination for 8  hrs and fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1  M PBS, pH 7.4 and
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1  M PBS.
Rabbit-anti GSK3β antibody and fluorochrome-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as primary and
secondary antibodies respectively. They were also stained
with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
(DAPI) to show the nucleus. Images were captured on a
Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope, equipped with a digital
camera (Nikon DS-Qi2) at 40 × magnification.
