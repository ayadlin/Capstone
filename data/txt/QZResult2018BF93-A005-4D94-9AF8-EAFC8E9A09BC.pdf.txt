Market Spiral Pricing of Cancer Drugs
Donald W . Light, PhD1; and Hagop Kantarjian, MD2

Every patient with cancer or another life-threatening disease wants the most effective treatment, but drug prices have
become staggering. Twelve of the 13 new cancer drugs approved last year were priced above $100,000 annually (Table 1),
and a 20% copayment makes them unaffordable, even for well-insured patients.1
What determines the escalating prices of cancer drugs? Pharmaceutical experts often cite the high research costs and
the benefit or added value of the new cancer drug. We believe that neither argument is well-founded and that pharmaceutical companies may be using a third strategy: constantly raising prices on last year‚Äôs drugs and then pricing new ones above
the new market price level; this is known as the Market Spiral Pricing Strategy.
The industry-sponsored estimate of average research costs to get a drug to market is $1.3 billion, including the cost
of failures.2,3 Such estimates may be significantly inflated:4
 First, half of this industry estimate is not research costs, but a high estimate of profits that companies would have made
if they had not invested in research in the first place. There are good reasons for subtracting these ‚Äúprofits foregone‚Äù as
not real research costs, which brings the average down from $1.3 billion to $650 million.
 Second, taxpayers subsidize about half of company research through various credits and deductions (though companies make
sure no one can get an accurate figure). This brings the average cost down to $325 million.
 Third, this industry estimate was made on the most costly fifth of new drugs and then misattributed to all drugs. Correcting
for this brings the average down by 30%, to $230 million.
 Fourth, a few costly projects always distort the average cost; therefore one should use the median, which is 26% less than
the average. The average is now down to $170 million.
 Fifth, there is no accurate estimate of basic research to discover new drugs because it varies so much; so an unverifiable
high estimate was added that made up at least a third of the total. More than 84% of all basic research for discovering
new drugs comes from the public, who also bear all the high risk.5 After deducting taxpayer subsidies, companies spend
only about 1.3% of revenues on basic research and the rest on developing minor variations or testing.6 Removing that
basic-research inflator brings the net median corporate research costs down to just $125 million (plus the variable costs
of basic research).
Although such calculations are subject to unknown variables or factors that could alter the final estimates, the statement
that ‚Äúit costs $1 billion to develop a drug to market,‚Äù which has been repeated so often that it is accepted as a solid truth, is
in fact a significant overestimate. Andrew Witty, chief executive officer of GlaxoSmithKline, stated in a recent health care
conference in London (March 2013) that the $1 billion cost to develop a drug is ‚Äúone of the great myths of the industry.‚Äù7
In the case of cancer drugs, most of the basic research and many clinical trials are paid by the National Cancer Institute and foundations, all free to companies. Further, clinical trials in cancer are smaller and shorter than trials for other diseases, so trial costs should be smaller too.8 In sum, there is no credible evidence that the net costs of the major companies
for cancer research are not lower than research costs for other drugs. Consequently, cancer drugs should be priced lower .
The added-value argument for unaffordable prices is not supported by objective data. Most new cancer drugs provide few or no clinical advantages over existing ones. Only one of the 12 new anticancer drugs approved in 2012 provides
survival gains that last more than 2 months (Table 1).

Market Spiral Pricing of Cancer Drugs/Light and Kantarjian

Some economic experts argue that, in a free-market
economy, pricing is based on ‚Äúwhat the market will bear,‚Äù
which will, in the long run, settle prices at reasonable levels. However, there appears to be no free-market forces,
but rather what seems to be monopoly rights to charge
similarly high prices, even when several cancer drugs are
available for the same cancer indication. Although 90% of
oncologists state they would prescribe a cheaper drug for
their patient if there are 2 drugs of similar efficacy and toxicity profiles, there are not enough drug price sensitivities
(or differences) to allow oncologists or patients to select
drugs based on costs savings.
In the past 5 years, companies have doubled the prices for cancer drugs, and have increased prices every year
on older drugs rather than reduce them.9 Other countries
do not allow such increases.
Market spiral pricing impoverishes desperate
patients, strapped taxpayers, and struggling employers. It
threatens universal access to critical care for patients facing
death. Congressional hearings on spiraling prices for specialist drugs, based on the myths of greater added value
and unsustainable research costs, are badly needed. In
fact, the dollars that companies have put into research
over the past 15 years have generated 6 times more revenues.10 Independent studies show that companies recover
all costs and make a reasonable profit at Canadian and European prices, but still charge Americans twice as much or
more.4
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
and Modernization Act of 2003 included legislation prohibiting Medicare from negotiating drug prices.11 This
legislation, probably influenced by the pharmaceutical
lobby, contributed to high drug prices and, when implemented in 2006, was associated with an immediate
increase in pharmaceutical company profits.12 An analysis
by Dean Baker, a well-known economist, suggested that
allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices could save $40
billion to $80 billion annually.13 Congress should eliminate the prohibition against Medicare negotiating discount prices on drugs; this could save the health care
industry billions of dollars annually and avoid a lot of grief
for patients.11,13 Congress should also prevent companies
from delaying access to generic drugs, which would not
only relieve millions of patients, but would also save on
average $80 billion to $100 billion annually, and would
foster more innovation, because patents generate more
innovation by ending, not by perpetuating, monopoly
pricing. Oncologists would then be able to treat their
patients with drugs they can afford.
