SUMMARY
Tetraspanins are commonly believed to act only as “molecular facilitators”, with no direct role in
signal transduction. We herein demonstrate that upon ligation, CD37, a tetraspanin molecule
expressed on mature normal and transformed B-cells, becomes tyrosine phosphorylated, associates
with proximal signaling molecules, and initiates a cascade of events leading to apoptosis.
Moreover, we have identified two tyrosine residues with opposing regulatory functions, one lies in

the N-terminal domain of CD37 in a predicted “ITIM-like” motif and mediates SHP1-dependent
death whereas the second lies in a predicted “ITAM motif” in the C-terminal domain of CD37 and
counteracts death signals by mediating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent survival.

INTRODUCTION
It is generally assumed that tetraspanins are not directly involved in signal transduction due
to the lack of embedded signaling motifs, and that they instead serve as “molecular
facilitators” of signal transduction (Maecker et al., 1997). For instance, tetraspanins such as
CD53 and CD63 associate with a protein tyrosine phosphatase in rat lymph node cells and a
rat mast cell line, respectively (Carmo and Wright, 1995), while CD9-mediated signaling in
platelets involves activation of the protein tyrosine kinase p72SYK (Ozaki et al., 1995).
Tetraspanins can also associate non-covalently with other immune molecules, i.e. CD9 and
CD63 with integrins (Berditchevski et al., 1995; Rubinstein et al., 1994), CD81 with CD19/
CD21 on B cells (Matsumoto et al., 1993) and with CD4 or CD8 on T cells (Imai and
Yoshie, 1993), suggesting that signaling through tetraspanins, possibly following binding to
a yet-unidentified ligand, may regulate the functions of key players in immune recognition.

CD37 is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) of tetraspanin proteins,
which have four potential membrane-spanning regions (Horejsi and Vlcek, 1991; Wright
and Tomlinson, 1994). CD37 is expressed in developing B cells from pre-B to peripheral
mature B-cell stages, but not plasma cells. T cells, monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells
express very low levels of CD37 (Schwartz-Albiez et al., 1988), and it is absent on platelets
and erythrocytes (van Spriel et al., 2004). CD37 forms protein complexes with CD53,
CD81, CD82, and class II glycoprotein on the B-cell surface that may represent an ion
channel or a transporter (Angelisova et al., 1994). Moreover, CD37 is expressed in B-cell
endosomes and exosomes, reflecting possible involvement in intracellular trafficking or
antigen presentation. Targeted inactivation of CD37 in mice revealed no changes in the
development of lymphoid organs, but reduced IgG1 levels and alteration of response to Tcell–dependent antigens indicating a possible role for CD37 in T cell–B cell interaction
(Knobeloch et al., 2000). Although the precise function of CD37 and its ligand remains
unknown, it has been proposed to have a role in signal transduction pathways that affects
cell development, activation and motility (Wright and Tomlinson, 1994). The direct
involvement of CD37 in signaling seems unlikely due to short cytoplasmic tails (8 to ~14
amino acids) that lack canonic signaling motifs.

Given its B-cell selective expression, CD37 represents a candidate therapeutic target for Bcell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Several peptides, including
anti-CD37 SMIP™ (mono-specific protein therapeutic, also referred to as SMIP-016), have
been shown to induce rapid and potent in vitro direct tumoricidal activity in lymphoma/
leukemia cells (Zhao et al., 2007). TRU-016, a humanized SMIP-016, is currently in a phase
1 clinical trial for relapsed CLL and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/). Other CD37 targeted antibodies are currently in early
clinical development (Hallek et al., 2008; Heider et al., 2011). However, the molecular basis
of CD37-mediated cell death is unknown.

time-dependent (Zhao et al., 2007) and correlates with CD37 antigen density (Figure S1B),
but not prognostic factors associated with poor outcome in CLL (Figure S1C–E). How
CD37 ligation induces apoptosis is unknown. Treatment of CLL cells with SMIP-016
induces tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins (Figure 1A) as indicated by
immunoblot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Zhao et al., 2007). To identify these
tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, we undertook a proteomic approach. CLL cells were
treated with SMIP-016 or trastuzumab, which does not bind CLL cells as these cells do not
express HER2. Trastuzumab therefore is a good negative control to rule out potential Fcγ
receptor mediated signaling. The lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE following
immunoprecipitation with 4G10 and the immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered by ingel digestion. Following a phosphopeptide enrichment step, peptides were analyzed by LCMS/MS.

Independent experiments from 5 patients reproducibly identified several tyrosine
phosphorylated proteins including protein phosphatase non receptor-type 6 (PTPN6/SHP1)
and the SRC family kinase LYN. SMIP-016-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP1 and
LYN was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using 4G10 followed by anti-SHP1 or antiLYN immunoblot analysis, and vice versa (Figure S1F and data not shown). Tyrosine
phosphorylation of SHP1 (Yi et al., 1992) has been implicated in cell growth regulation, and
loss of SHP1 in leukemia and other malignancies suggest it to be a tumor suppressor (Wu et
al., 2003). We first assessed SHP1, SHP2, and PP2A protein levels in CLL (Figure S1G)
and found variable expression of these proteins. To determine whether phosphorylation of
SHP1 alters its phosphatase activity, we immunoprecipitated SHP1 from CLL patient cells
treated with either trastuzumab or SMIP-016 and assessed its tyrosine phosphatase activity.
SHP1 purified from SMIP-016-treated cells exhibited increased enzymatic activity relative
to trastuzumab control (Figure 1B). SHP1 down regulation by siRNA resulted in almost
complete loss of SMIP-016-induced cytotoxicity compared to nonsense siRNA (Figure 1C)
supporting that SHP1 is involved in CD37-mediated cell death, which contrasts with SHP1independent death induced by CD20 ligation (Kheirallah et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also identified CD37, SHIP-1 and SYK in the LC-MS/MS analysis. CD37 has three
tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic tail. Detailed sequence analysis shows one of them at the
N-terminal (N-t) domain within a predicted weak immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif
(ITIM) and the other two at the C-terminal (C-t) domain, with one located in an YxxL
context within a single immune tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (Figure 1D). An
ITIM is a conserved sequence of amino acids (S/I/V/LxYxxI/V/L) that is found in the
cytoplasmic tails of many inhibitory receptors of the immune system. Interaction of ITIMbearing receptors with their ligands results in SRC family kinase-mediated tyrosine
phosphorylation of the ITIM motif and recruitment of other enzymes such as SHP1 and
SHP2, or SHIP-1, an inositol phosphatase, that decrease the activation of cell signaling
molecules. Similarly, the two tyrosine residues contained within the ITAM motif (defined
by a consensus sequence: YxxI/Lx(6–12)YxxI/L, where x represents any amino acid) are
typically phosphorylated by SRC family of tyrosine kinases. This results in recruitment of
SYK and initiation of downstream cell activation signals leading to proliferation. The
observations that 1) LYN and SHP1 are phosphorylated upon CD37 ligation; 2) SHP1 is
directly involved in CD37-mediated cell death; and 3) SHP1 is known to bind to weak ITIM
suggested that the ITIM-like motif in CD37 N-t might be functional. We confirmed that, in
CLL cells stimulated with SMIP-016, CD37 was tyrosine phosphorylated and associated
with both SHP1 and LYN (Figures 1E, 1F). Thus, CD37 engages the negative signaling
effectors SHP1 and LYN when tyrosine phosphorylated, consistent with the presence of an
ITIM.

SMIP-016-induced apoptosis requires translocation of CD37 into the lipid rafts

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Lipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains enriched in gangliosides
(glycosphingolipids) and cholesterol that are involved in many signal transduction
processes. For instance, apoptosis induced by rituximab (anti-CD20) requires translocation
of CD20 into lipid rafts where it interacts and activates protein tyrosine kinases LYN, FYN,
and LCK (Janas et al., 2005; Semac et al., 2003). Upon cross-ligation with SMIP-016, but
not trastuzumab, CD37 became associated within membrane lipid rafts along with pSHP1,
pLYN and pSRC (Figure 1G). GAPDH serves as a negative control for the isolation of
detergent insoluble membranes, whereas total LYN, SHP1 and SRC serve as a positive
control as they have been shown to normally reside in lipid rafts (Mone et al., 2004). The
purity of the fractions was confirmed using cholera toxin B subunit-HRP (CT-B) that binds
to GM-1, a specific marker of membrane lipid raft (Figure S1I). Cytochalasins inhibit Factin polymerization, interfere with lipid raft aggregation, and inhibit anti-HLA-DR and
anti-CD47 antibody-induced lymphocyte cell death (Truman et al., 1994). Similarly,
cytochalasin D (CytD) or latrunculin B (LatB) pretreatment of CLL cells reduced
SMIP-016-induced cell death (Figure S1J) and aggregation (Figure S1K).
Generation of CD37+FLAG 697 pTet-on cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To study in more detail the biology of CD37, we created an inducible CD37+FLAG 697 cell
line, a derivative of the CD37-negative 697 human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell
line, that expresses CD37 upon induction with doxycycline (Figures 2A, 2B). Consistent
with the signaling competence of the transfected CD37, treatment of CD37+FLAG 697 cells
with SMIP-016 significantly induced cytotoxicity (Figure 2C) as well as tyrosine
phosphorylation of multiple proteins (Figure 2D). Anti-CD19 was used as a control, as
CD19 levels are not affected by doxycycline treatment.
CD37 is tyrosine phosphorylated upon ligation by SMIP-016

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To study phosphorylation events, protein lysates from SMIP-016 treated CD37+FLAG 697
cells were immunoprecipitated with 4G10 followed by immunoblot analysis using
antibodies specific to proximal signaling targets. These studies identified tyrosine
phosphorylation of CD37 (as detected with anti-FLAG), LYN, SHP1 and SYK, following
SMIP-016 treatment (Figure 3A). Next, 4G10 immunoprecipitates from SMIP-016-treated
CD37+FLAG 697 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to in-gel trypsin
digestion followed by a phosphopeptide enrichment step. Proteomics analysis was then
performed by neutral loss tandem mass spectrometry on a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap
XL. Five unique peptides of CD37 isoforms A and B were found in SMIP-016-treated but
not trastuzumab-treated samples (Figure 3B), with 30% of the sequence covered including
phosphorylation at Tyr274 (C-terminal region). No alternative proteins were identified from
the 37 kDa region of the gel. Presence of CD37 in these immunoprecipitates was
independently verified by anti-FLAG immunoblot (data not shown). Furthermore, lysates
from SMIP-016 or trastuzumab-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG
antibody and analyzed by 4G10 immunoblot showing the presence of a band of
approximately 37 kDa (Figures 3C, 3D), in the SMIP-016 treated lysates, that was abolished
by treatment with λ-protein phosphatase (Figure 3D). Co-immunoprecipitation studies using
CD37+FLAG 697 cells were conducted to confirm that CD37 associates with LYN, SHP1
and SYK upon ligation with SMIP-016 (Figure 3E) and that LYN, SYK were also
phosphorylated (Figure 3F) similar to CLL cells. Initial attempts to downmodulate SHP1 in
this cell line model using siRNA were unsuccessful prompting creation of a 697 cell line
with stable expression of CD37 and doxycycline-inducible expression of a short hairpin (sh)
RNA for SHP1 (shSHP1). In these cells, downmodulation of SHP1 (by 120 hr) resulted in a
reduction of SMIP-016 mediated cell death consistent with the data in primary CLL cells
(Figure 3G).

CD37 possesses dual inhibitory and activation signaling functions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To study the relevance of tyrosine phosphorylation in CD37-mediated killing, 697 cell lines
carrying mutations or deletions of tyrosine residues in the cytosolic regions of the CD37
molecule were generated (Figure 4A). The deletion of Tyr274 or its mutation to
phenylalanine (Phe) did not affect surface expression of CD37 but significantly increased
the cytotoxic effect of SMIP-016 (Figure 4B). Deletion of the entire C-t cytosolic portion of
CD37, which includes Tyr274 and Tyr280 (Figure 4A), also did not affect surface expression
of CD37 but again significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of SMIP-016 (Figure 4C)
consistent with a regulatory function of this region in CD37-mediated cell death. To test the
relevance of Tyr13 in the putative N-t ITIM domain, 697 cell lines expressing an N-t
truncated CD37 [N-t(−)], a single deletion mutant [Tyr13(−)], or a Tyr13_Phe mutant were
generated (Figure 4A). In the N-t (−) and Tyr13(−) cells, no surface CD37 was observed
although CD37 mRNA was still produced and translated (data not shown).The lack of
surface expression of CD37 therefore could be attributed to the presence of a membrane
localization signal in the deleted portions of the molecule. In contrast, the substitution of
Tyr13 to Phe did not affect surface expression of CD37 but significantly reduced the
cytotoxic effect of SMIP-016 (Figure 4D) indicating that this region positively regulates
CD37-mediated cell death consistent with an ITIM function for this domain. A similar death
pattern among the cell lines was also observed for NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Figure S2A), further demonstrating the physiologic relevance
of CD37 phosphorylation at the ITIM and ITAM sites.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The effects of N-t and C-t tyrosine deletions on protein-protein interactions and tyrosine
phosphorylation were also studied. SMIP-016 treatment of cells induced phosphorylation of
both the C-t deleted and the wild type (WT) CD37 (Figure 4E) that was sensitive to λprotein phosphatase treatment (Figure 4F) but the amount of phosphorylation was visibly
higher for the C-t deleted CD37, suggesting that the C-t domain interferes with
phosphorylation of the N-t. Furthermore, the lack of the C-t region did not prevent CD37
association with SHP1, LYN and SYK (Figure 4G) or co-association of LYN and SHP1
(Figure S2B). In contrast, the replacement of Tyr13 with Phe notably reduced SMIP-016induced CD37 phosphorylation (Figure 4H), and prevented association of SHP1 and LYN
with CD37 (Figure 4I) as well as each other (Figure S2B). Together, these data suggest that
Tyr13 acts in the context of an ITIM motif, phosphorylation of which mediates apoptosis
through recruitment and activation of LYN and SHP1. Importantly, the Tyr13-Phe/C-t(−)
double mutant CD37 was not phosphorylated when cells were treated with SMIP-016
(Figure 4H). Furthermore, consistent with our previous report (Zhao et al., 2007),
herbimycin treatment of the WT and the C-t(−) cell lines prevented cell death (data not
shown) and SHP1-CD37 association in both cell lines (Figure 4J). To further demonstrate
the phosphorylation and ITIM function of CD37 at the N-t region, we carried out GST pull
down experiment based on the assumption that SH2 domains of SHP1 can only bind to
phosphorylated ITIM domains. Lysates derived from 697 cells expressing various forms of
CD37 and treated with trastuzumab or SMIP-016 were incubated with GST-SHP1(SH2)N-t,
GST-SHP1(SH2)C-t, or GST-SHIP(SH2) fusion proteins, protein-protein complexes were
then purified using Glutathione agarose beads (GSH beads). The results show that both
GST-SHP1(SH2)N-t and GST-SHP1(SH2)C-t pulled down the WT and the C-t(−) deleted
CD37, but not the Tyr13-Phe or the Tyr13-Phe/C-t(−) CD37. GST and GST-SHIP(SH2)
served as negative controls (Figure S2C). The p85 regulatory and the p110 catalytic subunits
of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) have been shown to bind to phosphorylated
tyrosines within the ITAM (YxxL) motif of the FcγRIIa in macrophages (Cooney et al.,
2001). However it is not known whether this association is ITAM-mediated and direct, or
indirect via an adapter molecule. We hypothesized that the C-t portion of CD37 negatively
regulates cell death by activating a PI3K-dependent survival signaling. Interestingly, WT but

not C-t(−) CD37 cells recruit p85 and p110δ upon stimulation with SMIP-016, indicating
that these proteins bind to the C-t portion of CD37 (Figure 4K), consistent with an ITAM
function for this domain. The targets of PI3K family kinases include AKT, which is known
to mediate B-cell proliferation and survival in response to B cell receptor cross-ligation
through phosphorylation and inactivation of its downstream target GSK3β Upon CD37
ligation with SMIP-016, AKT and GSK3β become phosphorylated in WT but not C-t(−) cell
lines (Figure 4L). Moreover, treatment of the WT cell line with the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002, using a concentration (10 μM) that inhibits PI3K, resulted in increased
SMIP-016-mediated cell death up to the level of the C-t(−) cell line (Figure 4M). A similar
effect is also seen in primary CLL cells, where the combination of suboptimal doses of
SMIP-016 (0.1 μg/ml) with LY294002 or with the PI3Kδ inhibitor CAL-101 is more
cytotoxic compared to any agent alone (Figure S2D, S2E). Surprisingly, PI3Kγ was also
recruited upon CD37 cross-ligation. However its binding was specific to the N-t portion, as
it was found associated to CD37 even in the absence of the C-t domain (Figure 4N). A
functional interaction between PI3K p85/p55 and SHP1 has been shown in T lymphocytes
(Cuevas et al., 1999). This interaction was also associated with a reduction in PI3Kmediated phosphorylation of AKT, suggesting that PI3K signaling can be regulated by
SHP1. Together, these results suggest that upon ligation of CD37, two opposing stimuli act
simultaneously on AKT, and that the outcome for the cell represents a balance between
these two counteracting pathways.

CD37 ligation mediates mitochondrial membrane depolarization in CLL cells
We have previously shown that cross-ligation of CD37 by SMIP-016 induces apoptosis of
CLL cells (Zhao et al., 2007) as early as 4hr (data not shown) and peaked at 18hr. Apoptosis
is induced via two main routes involving either the mitochondria (the intrinsic pathway) or
the activation of death receptors (the extrinsic pathway). Both pathways converge to induce
the activation of caspases, although in the past years mitochondrial-mediated caspaseindependent forms of apoptosis have been reported (Loeffler et al., 2001). We therefore
measured mitochondrial membrane depolarization (MMD) of CLL cells in response to
SMIP-016 using JC-1 staining. While no MMD was observed in trastuzumab-treated
samples, (Figures 5A, 5B), CD37 ligation resulted in 50% MMD. BIM is a critical BH3 only
domain BCL-2 family member protein responsible for mitochondrial induced apoptosis.
Interestingly, CD37 ligation of CLL cells resulted in consistent up-regulation of BIM at both
the protein (Figure 5C) and mRNA level (Fig 5D) while protein level of other pro- and antiapoptotic proteins such as BAX, BCL2 and MCL1 remained unchanged (Figures 5C and
S3).
CD37 cross-ligation increases FoxO3a-dependent transcription of BIM

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CLL and a variety of other B-cell lymphomas show aberrant expression of TCL1, an
oncoprotein with multiple roles in B-cell transformation including active translocation of
pAKT to the nucleus (Figure S4A). Cytoplasmic pAKT is modest in non-stimulated CLL
cells, while nuclear pAKT is dramatically increased (Herman et al., 2010). CD37 ligation by
SMIP-016 resulted in a decrease of CD40L-induced PI3K activity (Figure S4B). More
importantly, ligation of CD37 in CLL cells decreased basal nuclear pAKT (Figure 6A) and
CD40L-induced cytosolic pAKT (Figure S4C). Given the observation that increased pAKT
is present in CLL cell nuclei, we hypothesized that this kinase might be influencing FoxO3a,
a downstream targets of pAKT and a major transcription factor regulating the expression of
BIM. As shown in Figure 6B, cross-ligation of CD37 significant increases the nuclear
FoxO3a level. To determine if SMIP-016 upregulates BIM transcriptionally, a region of the
BIM promoter containing the FoxO-binding site (FHRE) was cloned into a luciferase
reporter construct (Figure 6C) and transiently transfected into CLL cells. As shown in
Figure 6D, BIM promoter activity was significantly induced by SMIP-016 treatment of the

transfected cells. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using an
oligonucleotide sequence derived from the BIM promoter region containing FHRE showed
increased protein binding in nuclear extract derived from CLL cells treated with SMIP-016,
but not the trastuzumab control (Figure 6E). This binding was specific for WT but not
mutant FHRE and was prevented by using an excess of cold WT, but not mutant,
oligonucleotide probe (Figure 6F). The physical interaction of FoxO3a with the BIM
promoter in response to SMIP-016 was further confirmed by oligonucleotide pull down
assay (Figure 6G) showing that SMIP-016 treatment increase the binding of FoxO3a to the
oligos containing a WT but not mutant FHRE. Next, ChIP assay showed an increased
binding of FoxO3a to the endogenous BIM promoter in SMIP-016-treated CLL cells (Figure
6H) but not in cells treated with irrelevant antibody (IgG; data not shown). Thus, the
increased transcriptional up-regulation of BIM via FoxO3a following CD37 ligation by
SMIP-016 correlates with the increased BIM protein expression described above.
BIM up-regulation contributes to CD37 ligation-mediated apoptosis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BIM mRNA and protein upregulation was concurrent with its translocation to the
mitochondria as well as the cleavage of mitochondrial BAX into p21 and p18 fragments
(Figure 7A), which was only detected in the enriched mitochondrial fractions but not in the
whole cell lysates (Figure 5C), consistent with the observed MMD following CD37 ligation
(Figure 5A). Furthermore, BIM down-modulation by siRNA (Figure S5A) resulted in
inhibition of mitochondrial depolarization with increased intact mitochondria (Figure 7B),
and partial reduction of SMIP-016-induced cytotoxicity compared to the scrambled siRNA
control (Figure 7C). SHP1 has been implicated in negative regulation of neuronal survival
by inhibiting phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK and AKT and increasing BIM expression
(Marsh et al., 2003). To determine if proximal SHP1 activation by SMIP-016 directly
contributes to BIM up-regulation, siRNA to SHP1 was used. As shown in Figure 7D, SHP1specific siRNA antagonized BIM up-regulation in CLL cells. Collectively, these studies
suggest a direct role for SHP1 in down-regulating the activity of AKT, which in turn inhibits
FoxO3a nuclear translocation leading to induction of BIM (Figure 7E).
SMIP-016, but not trastuzumab, also induced nuclear translocation of FoxO3a (Figure S5B)
and up-regulation of BIM in WT CD37+FLAG 697 cells (Figure S5C). AKT
phosphorylation was absent in the WT cell line at 18 hours (Figure S5D) corresponding to a
later time where BIM induction is seen. Moreover, the deletion of Tyr13 but not Tyr274
prevented SMIP-016-induced up-regulation of BIM in CD37+FLAG 697 cells (Figure S5E).
Together, these results support our hypothesis that CD37 directly regulates CLL cell
survival.

DISCUSSION
Our study focused on elucidating the role of CD37 in the transduction of apoptotic signals in
transformed B-cells. Analysis of the CD37 protein sequence revealed three tyrosine residues
in its cytoplasmic domains with two opposing functions. One of these residues is localized at
the N-t domain within the sequence IKYFLFV that resembles an ITIM-motif (V/L/IxYxxV/
L) but with an additional residue between the tyrosine and valine. The other two tyrosine
residues are located at the C-t domain of CD37, one of which is in a YxxL context within a
single ITAM-like signaling motif. ITAM-like motifs were originally described in Dectin-1,
and since then, examples of ITAM-based signaling that do not conform precisely to the
standard model are becoming increasingly common (Underhill et al., 2005). Moreover, it
has been demonstrated that a synthetic peptide based on the phosphorylated single YxxL
motif of Dectin-1 binds to SYK (Rogers et al., 2005), suggesting that a single tyrosine
phosphorylation might be sufficient to recruit SYK. Through the use of independent
biochemical and proteomic approaches, we demonstrate that upon cross-ligation, CD37 is

tyrosine phosphorylated directly at two distinct tyrosine residues within the N-t (ITIM-like)
and C-t (ITAM-like) cytosolic regions. Differences in baseline level of phosphorylation
observed in primary CLL cells but not in the CD37+FLAG 697 cell line noted in our
experiments could be attributed to in vivo stimulation of CLL cells by hitherto unidentified
natural ligand for CD37. When a tyrosine in the ITIM is phosphorylated, it forms a docking
site for the SRC homology 2 (SH2) recognition domains of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1.
Conversely, ITAM motifs are phosphorylated by SYK. Once phosphorylated the pITAM
motif activates SYK, which in turn phosphorylates downstream targets that facilitate
survival signaling through PI3K.

We further investigated which complex was recruited by each of these tyrosine domains and
demonstrated, as expected, opposing roles for these two tyrosine residues in cell survival.
We found that upon ligation of CD37, the N-t tyrosine within the ITIM-like motif becomes
phosphorylated and associates with a specific complex of proteins including LYN, SHP1,
SYK and PI3Kγ, whereas p85 and PI3Kδ were specifically recruited at the C-t domain.
Taken together, these data indicate that at least two counteracting signaling pathways
originate from ligation of CD37. One pathway acts through phosphorylation and activation
of the ITIM-like motif at the N-t of CD37 by LYN kinase, leading to SHP1 recruitment and
FoxO3a-dependent BIM upregulation and subsequent mitochondrial depolarization and cell
death. These ITIM-like and ITAM-like functions also influence NK cell-mediated SMIP
cytotoxicity, demonstrating the potential for tumor target antigen signaling influencing
innate immune cell killing.
Our data clearly demonstrate that SHP1 is the major driving pathway of death of CD37
ligation, but does not exclude the possibility that other signaling pathways including
proximal LYN and SYK might be involved as well. The second pathway acts through
tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM-like motif at the CD37 C-t domain, with recruitment
and activation of PI3K, AKT, phosphorylation of GSK3β and promotion of cell survival.
The binding of p85 to the phosphorylated YxxL peptide is direct, rather than through a
phosphorylated adapter protein such as SYK. However, these findings do not completely
exclude the involvement of an unidentified adapter protein in p85/PI3K recruitment. This
complicated signaling network affords the potential for approaches to augment CD37
directed therapy. Combination treatment with SMIP-016 and the PI3Kδ isoform-specific
inhibitor CAL-101 demonstrated synergy, providing clinical rationale for combining these
approaches in clinical trials. A diagram of the signaling induced by CD37 ligation is shown
in Figure 8.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While we showed that SMIP-016 efficacy is independent of traditional prognostic factors in
CLL, a large variability in cell death was observed which can be partially attributed to the
heterogeneity of CD37 expression in CLL cells and to the simultaneous activation of both
pro-death (N-t) and survival (C-t) signaling with SMIP-016 ligation of CD37. No mutations
in the CD37 were identified among 120 patients studied (data not shown), although this
cannot exclude that CD37 or SHP1 can become mutated or otherwise altered in resistant
cells and warrants further study. Additionally, the mechanism by which BIM induction
occurs with the CD19 antibody warrants further study.
In summary we demonstrated herein: 1) that CD37 can function as a death receptor in Bcells; 2) the presence of two distinct regulatory motifs with opposing functions within the
same molecule; and 3) a direct involvement of a tetraspanin in cell death signaling in CLL
cells.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell isolation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Blood was obtained from patients with CLL as defined by 2008 IWCLL criteria (Cheson et
al., 1996; Hallek et al., 2008). All patients provided informed consent under an Ohio State
University Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. CLL B cells were isolated and
cultured as previously described (Lapalombella et al., 2010). The purity of tumor cells in the
enriched populations was always greater than 95% as detected by dual CD19/CD3 staining.
Chemical reagents and cell treatment
SMIP-016 (5μg/ml) was produced by Emergent BioSolutions (previously Trubion
Pharmaceuticals, Seattle, WA) and is the chimeric parental molecule of TRU-016; 2-fluoroara-A (2-Fara, 5μM), rituximab (10μg/ml) and trastuzumab (10μg/ml) were obtained from
the OSU pharmacy; goat anti-human IgG (αFc, at 5X antibody concentration) was
purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; and sodium stilbogluconate and
LY294002 were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). FITC-labeled annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from BD Pharmingen, (San Diego, CA).

SIGNIFICANCE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The signaling role of CD37 in normal and transformed B-cells has not been
characterized. Our extensive studies have identified a unique function of CD37 as a death
receptor in B-cells. We have demonstrated that CD37 is a tetraspanin that can directly
mediate dual signal transduction through the C- and N-terminal domain. The finding that
two independent regions of CD37 exert completely different functions by concurrently
activating cell death and survival pathways opens up opportunities for immunotherapy
directed at CD37 cell death mediated signaling in combination with development of
small inhibitory peptides or kinase inhibitors that target the C-terminal activation domain
to maximize cell death.

Figure 5. CD37 ligation mediates mitochondrial membrane depolarization in primary CLL cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A, B) Representative data for JC-1 staining of CLL cells treated with αFc, trastuzumab
+αFc, SMIP-016+αFc or 2-fluoro-ara-A (2-Fara) for 12hr (A). A gate was drawn around
the population with aggregated JC-1 (intact mitochondria) in untreated cells. Using this gate,
the percentage of cells with intact mitochondria in treated samples was then calculated
relative to the untreated sample, set at 100% (n=12) (B). (C) Lysates derived from CLL cells
treated as indicated were analyzed by immunoblot for expression of BIM and BAX. β-Actin
was used as loading control. The BIM level relative to the loading control was determined
from 5 immunoblots using different patient samples. (D) Real time PCR analysis of BIM
mRNA in trastuzumab+αFc or SMIP-016+αFc treated CLL cells (12 hr, n=7). Data are
represented as mean ± SD for all the relevant panels. See also Figure S3.

Figure 8. Schema for SMIP-016 induced cytotoxicity

Upon ligation of CD37 two signaling pathways are generated, one acting through
phosphorylation of the N-t ITIM-like motif of CD37 by LYN kinase, leading to SHP1
dependent BIM upregulation and cell death. A second pathway acts through tyrosine
phosphorylation of the C-t ITAM-like motif of CD37 with activation of GSK3β and
promotion of cell survival.
