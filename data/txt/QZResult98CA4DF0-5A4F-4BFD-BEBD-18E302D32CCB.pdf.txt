rate of <5%. In part, this is because melanoma is highly resistant to
most currently available forms of therapy, leading to extremely high
mortality rates.
Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is an essential process in
normal tissue development, but it is also essential for normal tissue
homeostasis (2). It is induced in response to stress and by various
biological effectors, such as some of the hormones and cytokines
that are secreted by activated lymphocytes and macrophages.
Importantly, apoptosis also plays a role in cancer. Resistance to
apoptosis is a well-documented hallmark of cancer (3) and seems
to play a critical role in melanoma, where many antiapoptotic
pathways provide survival signals. Furthermore, the resistance of
melanoma to currently used therapies occurs in part because
melanoma cells safeguard their survival through mechanisms that
allow them to escape death receptor–mediated apoptosis. Of
particular note are cytokines of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
family, which includes TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL), Fas ligand (FasL), and TNF-a (4), the latter two of which
are secreted by cells of the immune system. When these ligands
bind to their receptors [TRAIL receptor, Fas receptor, and TNF
receptor (TNFR) 1/2], they induce receptor trimerization and
thereby stimulate recruitment of several proteins which form a
complex called the death-inducing signaling complex (5). This
complex dissociates from the receptors and binds to the adaptor
molecule Fas-associated death domain, leading to activation of a
caspase cascade and consequently to cell death.
Another important signaling pathway in melanoma is the RAS/
RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK cascade. RAS is a
small G protein that is embedded in the plasma membrane and
that is activated downstream of growth factor receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs), cytokines, and hormones (6). RAF is a protein
kinase that is activated following its recruitment to the plasma
membrane by RAS (7). RAF then phosphorylates and activates the
protein kinase MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates
ERK, the third protein kinase in the cascade. ERK phosphorylates
numerous cytosolic and nuclear proteins to regulate gene
expression, metabolism, and the cytoskeleton, thereby regulating
cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and survival. This
pathway also seems to play an important role in human cancer.
RAS genes are mutated in f15% of human cancers, and recently, it
was discovered that one of the three RAF isoforms in humans,
BRAF, is mutated in f7% of human cancers (8). This pathway is
particularly important in melanoma, with NRAS being mutated in
15% to 30% of melanomas and BRAF in 50% to 70% of cases (8).
Consequently, ERK is hyperactivated in the majority of melanoma
cases (1).
More than 70 different cancer-associated mutations have been
described in BRAF in human cancer, but the most common
substitution is a glutamic acid for valine substitution at position
600 (V600E, formally V599E), which accounts for >90% of all cases.

Abstract
The protein kinase BRAF, a component of the RAS/RAF/
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK signaling pathway, regulates
cell fate in response to extracellular signals. Activating
mutations in BRAF occur in f70% of human melanomas.
The active proteins stimulate constitutive pathway signaling,
proliferation, and survival. Thus, inhibition of BRAF signaling
in melanoma cells causes cell cycle arrest and induces cell
death through apoptosis, validating BRAF as an important
therapeutic target. Here, we show that the apoptosis induced
by inhibition of BRAF signaling in melanoma cells can be
prevented if the cells are treated with tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-A. This allows the cells to recover from the inhibition
of BRAF signaling and reenter the cell cycle. This effect
occurs due to a specific TNF-A and BRAF interaction because
TNF-A does not prevent cell death in the presence of
cisplatin, nitrogen mustard or thapsigargin. Furthermore,
the cytokines Fas ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 do not prevent cell death
when BRAF signaling is inhibited. The survival mechanism
requires nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) transcription factor
activity, which is strongly induced by TNF-A in these cells.
These findings suggest that drugs that target the BRAF/MEK
pathway could be combined with agents that target TNF-A
and/or NF-KB signaling to provide exciting new therapeutic
opportunities for the treatment of melanoma. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Melanoma is a form of cancer that arises from melanocytes, the
specialized pigmented cells found in the epidermis (1). The only
known environmental risk factor is exposure to UV irradiation in
the form of natural sunlight or from unnatural sources. The
incidence of melanoma is rising at alarming rates in most Western
societies, with a doubling of cases within the last 20 years. When
treated early, melanoma can be cured by simple surgical resection,
but in its metastatic malignant form, it is particularly difficult to
treat with a median survival rate of 6 months and a 5-year survival

TNF-a Prevents Melanoma Cell Death
V600E

Materials and Methods

BRAF is 500-fold activated and stimulates constitutive MEKERK signaling in cancer cells (9). In melanoma, V600EBRAF provides
both proliferation and prosurvival signals (1); thus, when BRAF
signaling is inhibited through the use of RNA interference (RNAi)
or inhibition of MEK-ERK signaling by small molecular weight
inhibitors of MEK, melanoma cell proliferation is inhibited and the
cells die through apoptosis (10, 11). Together, these studies have
identified oncogenic BRAF and this signaling pathway as an
exciting and important new therapeutic target.
Here, we examine the interplay between BRAF and death
receptor signaling in melanoma cells. We show that although
inhibition of oncogenic BRAF signaling stimulates death of
melanoma cells, when the cells are treated with TNF-a, this death
is reversed and the cells recover to reenter the cell cycle. These
prosurvival effects are due to a specific interaction between BRAF
and TNF-a because they are not seen with other cytokines or when
death is induced using other cytotoxic drugs. The TNF-a-mediated
survival seen when BRAF signaling is inhibited requires the
transcription factor nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) and, in at least
one of the lines tested, the cell cycle regulator p21Cip1 is required.
Taken together, these results suggest that therapies based on
inhibition of oncogenic BRAF may be ineffective in melanoma
unless they are combined with agents that inhibit TNF-a or NF-nB
signaling, providing exciting new strategies that could be used to
treat this potentially devastating disease.

Cell culture and treatments. A375, WM266.4, and Colo829 were
cultured and lysates were prepared as described (11). Western blotting was
done using standard protocols and the following antibodies: ERK2, p21Cip1,
p50, p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Calne, United Kingdom), phospho-ERK
(Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; BD
PharMingen, Cowley, United Kingdom), TNFR1, and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R;
Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Cells were treated with recombinant
TNF-a, TRAIL (Sigma), FasL, IL-1, or IL-6 (Peprotech, London, United
Kingdom) at 50 ng/mL for the times indicated. Enbrel (2.5 Ag/mL; Wyeth
UK, Maidenhead, United Kingdom) was premixed (37jC, 60 min) with
TNF-a in cell culture medium before incubation with cells. As required,
TNF-a was added 24 h after small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection.
Cells were incubated with U0126 (10 Amol/L; Promega, Southampton,
United Kingdom), PD184352 (1–2 Amol/L for A375 and Colo829 and
5 Amol/L for WM266.4, synthesized as described in ref. 12), cisplatin
(5 Amol/L for A375 and Colo829 and 20 Amol/L for WM266.4; Sigma),
thapsigargin (10 nmol/L for A375, 0.5 Amol/L for Colo829, and 2 Amol/L for
WM266.4; Sigma), nitrogen mustard (10 Amol/L for A375, 2 Amol/L for
Colo829, and 20 Amol/L for WM266.4; Sigma) for 48 h before analysis.
Detection of cell death. The cellular sub-G1 fraction was determined by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using propidium iodide staining
and standard protocols. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was
measured using a colorimetric assay following the supplier’s protocols
(Sigma) and caspase-3 activity was determined using an Ac-DEVD-AMC
fluorogenic substrate as recommended by the supplier (BD PharMingen).
All assays were done in triplicate.

G2-M phase of the cell cycle is shown.

Immunofluorescence. TNFR1, IL-1R, and p21Cip1 expression was
detected using standard protocols with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma)–fixed
cells. Intact cells were used to detect TNFR1 and IL-1R, but the cells were
permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) to reveal p21Cip1 expression.
The cells were counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
nuclear stain (Sigma) and mounted in 1,4-diazabicyclooctane (Sigma).
RNA interference. RNAi was done as described (11) using the following
siRNA oligonucleotides: BRAF, AAAGAATTGGATCTGGATCAT; p21Cip1,
AATGGCGGGCTGCATCCAGGA; p65, GCCCTATCCCTTTACGTCA; p50,
AAGGGGCTATAATCCTGGACT; and scrambled, AAACCGTCGATTTCACCCGGG.
Clonogenic survival assay. A375 cells were treated with the indicated
drugs and TNF-a for the times indicated and then replated at equal
densities. After 14 to 21 days, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and
stained with 1% crystal violet (Sigma) in 70% ethanol. Cell density was
quantified by dissolving the crystal violet bound to the cells in 10% (v/v)
acetic acid and by measuring the absorbance of this acetic acid solution at
595 nm.
Luciferase reporter assay. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE
(Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) with 0.8 Ag total DNA [0.3 Ag NF-nBresponsive luciferase reporter construct (13) and 0.5 Ag h-galactosidase
control] and extracts were prepared 48 h post-transfection for luciferase
activity measurement, using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized
relative to the h-galactosidase control.

(V600EBRAF), Colo829 (V600EBRAF), and WM266.4 cells (V600DBRAF)
induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (11). When BRAF signaling
was suppressed through the use of RNAi, cell death became
apparent within 48 h and peaked at 72 h. In contrast, death
induced by small-molecule inhibitors of MEK, such as PD184352,
occurred more rapidly and was evident within 24 h and peaked at
48 h (data not shown). This presumably reflects the fact that MEK
inhibitors block ERK activity more rapidly than when BRAF protein
is depleted through use of RNAi. The induction of apoptosis in
these cells can be measured by the appearance of a sub-G1 peak in
FACS profiles following treatment with siRNA to BRAF (Fig. 1A).
Because melanoma cells are resistant to death receptor–
mediated apoptosis, we wished to investigate if TNF-a could
augment the levels of cell death induced by BRAF siRNA.
Unexpectedly however, rather than augmenting cell death, TNF-a
attenuated cell killing in BRAF siRNA-treated cells, as shown by the
suppression of the sub-G1 peak in the FACS profiles (Fig. 1A). We
extended these findings by measuring release of LDH from the
cytoplasm of these cells as an independent measure of cell death.
BRAF siRNA caused robust LDH release from Colo829 cells, but
TNF-a suppressed this in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B).
Similar results were observed when these cells were treated with
U0126 and PD184352, two small-molecule inhibitors of MEK. Both
agents induced death in all three lines, as shown by the appearance
of a sub-G1 peak in the FACS profiles (Fig. 1C) and by the release of
cytosolic LDH (Fig. 1D). Importantly, in each case, the induction of
death by these MEK inhibitors was attenuated by TNF-a, but note
that TNF-a did not activate ERK in these cells (Fig. 1A and C),
showing that it did not reverse death induced by MEK inhibition
through cryptic reactivation of ERK.

Results
It has been shown recently that cancer cells that harbor
mutations in BRAF are more sensitive to MAPK pathway inhibition
than cells where BRAF is not mutated (14). In agreement with this,
we have reported that inhibition of BRAF signaling in three
melanoma cell lines that harbor V600 mutations in BRAF, A375

TNF-a Prevents Melanoma Cell Death

unable to rescue the cells treated with cisplatin and it actually
augmented the killing observed with thapsigargin (Fig. 3B).
Together, these results show that the prosurvival activity of BRAF
in melanoma is specific to the oncogenic form and that the ability
of cytokines to rescue cells when this signaling is inhibited is
specific to TNF-a. Furthermore, TNF-a does not provide prosurvival signals to cells under other conditions that induce death in
melanoma cells. Importantly, one consequence of TNF-a treatment
when BRAF signaling is inhibited is that melanoma cells recover
and reenter the cell cycle.
We next investigated the mechanism(s) underlying the prosurvival activity of TNF-a in melanoma cells when BRAF signaling is
suppressed, examining the role of NF-nB, because this transcription factor is constitutively activated in melanoma, is downstream
of TNF-a receptors, and has been implicated in many aspects of
melanoma initiation and progression (15). First, we examined
NF-nB activity in these melanoma cells, using a luciferase reporter
gene whose activity depends on a nB element (13). All three cell
lines displayed basal levels of luciferase reporter activity and this
was suppressed when the p65 subunit of NF-nB was depleted
(Supplementary Fig. S1B), showing that the reporter construct
activity is dependent on NF-nB signaling. Importantly, TNF-a
induced a 140-fold increase in luciferase expression from this
reporter in A375 cells (Fig. 4A). In the presence of the MEK
inhibitor, TNF-a was still able to stimulate luciferase activity albeit
to a lower level (Fig. 4A), but importantly, this luciferase activity
was suppressed when the p65 subunit of NF-nB was depleted
(Fig. 4B), again confirming that the reporter activity is dependent
on NF-nB activity. Notably, NF-nB activation by IL-1 and IL-6 was
moderate compared with TNF-a-induced activity and FasL did not
activate NF-nB in A375 cells (Fig. 4C). Similar results were observed
in Colo829 and WM266.4 cells (data not shown), suggesting
common responses in all three cell lines. For IL-1, the lack of

We next wished to examine if the responses to TNF-a were
specific. First, we showed that all three cell lines express TNFR1 to
similar levels (Supplementary Fig. S1A). As important controls, we
show that the prosurvival activity of TNF-a was blocked by Enbrel,
a specific antagonist of TNF-a and also that U0126 did not induce
apoptosis in CHL cells, a melanoma line, in which BRAF is not
mutated (Fig. 2A; ref. 8). We also show that TRAIL and FasL, two
cytokines related to TNF-a, did not rescue PD184352-induced cell
death (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6, two other
cytokines that are secreted by macrophages, also failed to block
PD184352-induced cell death (Fig. 2B). We also wished to examine
if TNF-a was prosurvival under all conditions that induce death in
these cells. A375 cells were treated with the DNA alkylating agents
cisplatin or nitrogen mustard or with the Ca2+ pump inhibitor
thapsigargin and the cell cycle profiles were examined. As expected,
PD184352 induced a G1 cell cycle arrest and the appearance of a
sub-G1 peak that was reversed by TNF-a (Fig. 2C). Thapsigargin
also induced a G1 cell cycle arrest and sub-G1 peak, but TNF-a
augmented, rather than suppressed, the effects of thapsigargin
(Fig. 2C). Cisplatin and nitrogen mustard induce cell death by
cross-linking DNA and this is apparent by the appearance of a
G2-M cell cycle arrest in the FACS profiles (Fig. 2C). TNF-a did not
suppress the induction of the G2-M cell cycle arrest induced by
cisplatin and actually enhanced the G2-M cell cycle arrest induced
by nitrogen mustard (Fig. 2C). Similar results were observed in
WM266.4 and Colo829 cells (data not shown).
We next examined the long-term consequences of MEK
inhibition. A375 cells were treated with PD184352 in the presence
or absence of TNF-a for various times and then assessed for their
long-term survival by clonogenic assay. PD184352 caused a
profound reduction in the long-term survival of A375 cells,
particularly at later time points, but the induction of death was
significantly reduced by TNF-a (Fig. 3A). In contrast, TNF-a was

Fig. 4B), a protein that is implicated in chemoresistance in other
cancers (17). Surprisingly, however, when the cells were treated with
TNF-a and the MEK inhibitors together, rather than augmenting
each other as expected, these agents antagonized each other and
p21Cip1 expression was restored (Fig. 6A and B). The reduction of
p21Cip1 expression in the presence of the MEK inhibitors correlated
with induction of apoptosis as shown by induction of PARP
cleavage in these samples. p21Cip1 expression was reduced in the
presence of PD184352 and U0126, conditions that lead to PARP
cleavage (Fig. 6A). However, when the cells were treated with
PD184352 or U0126 in the presence of TNF-a, p21Cip1 expression
was restored and PARP cleavage was blocked (Fig. 6A). Note
however, that a reduction in p21Cip1 protein levels in the absence of
MEK inhibition was not sufficient to induce apoptosis; p21Cip1
expression was reduced in cells treated with TNF-a, but PARP
cleavage was not observed (Fig. 6A) and TNF-a did not induce
apoptosis in these cells (Figs. 1 and 3).
We therefore examined if the recovery in p21Cip1 expression was
necessary to prevent apoptosis. WM266.4 cells were treated with
siRNA to p21Cip1, conditions that lead to a profound reduction in
protein levels (Fig. 6C). Importantly, when p21Cip1 protein levels
were suppressed, the combined treatment of PD184352 and TNF-a
failed to prevent PARP cleavage (Fig. 6C). Similar results were
observed with NF-nB. Ablation of the p65 subunit blocked p21Cip1
reexpression in the presence of PD184352 and TNF-a and also
blocked the inhibition of PARP cleavage. Thus, in WM266.4 cells,

response does not seem to be due to absence of the receptor
because we were able to detect the presence of IL-1R and TNF-a
receptor 1 by immunohistochemistry in all three cell lines (Fig. 4D;
Supplementary Fig. S2).
Depletion of either the p50 or the p65/RelA subunits of NF-nB
by RNAi reversed the prosurvival activity of TNF-a in the presence
of MEK inhibitors (Fig. 5A). These effects on cell survival are
specific to NF-nB subunit depletion, as shown by the lack of effect
observed with the scrambled control (Fig. 5B). To verify these
findings, we also examined caspase-3 activation and PARP
cleavage, two other markers of apoptosis. Caspase-3 was activated
(Fig. 5C) and PARP was cleaved (Fig. 5D) in PD184352-treated cells
and both events were blocked by TNF-a. Notably, depletion of the
p65 subunit of NF-nB reversed the ability of TNF-a to block
caspase-3 activation and induce PARP cleavage in PD184352treated cells (Fig. 5C and D).
We next examined genes that are downstream of NF-nB to further
characterize the pathway that regulates these effects. We examined
expression of XIAP, Mcl-1, and BclXL, proteins that are known to play
a role in regulation of apoptosis (16), but we did not find any
preliminary evidence to suggest that these proteins play a role in
mediating the survival of melanoma cells treated with TNF-a in the
presence of MEK inhibitors (data not shown). However, we found
that TNF-a, U0126, and PD184352 all suppressed expression of the
small molecular weight cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory protein
p21Cip1 in WM266.4 cells (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 1, 2, 5, and 9;

TNF-a Prevents Melanoma Cell Death

p21Cip1 is a critical TNF-a/NF-nB target gene, but the regulation of
this gene is complex. Its expression is suppressed when MEK is
inhibited or the cells are treated with TNF-a but recovers when
MEK is inhibited in the presence of TNF-a and this recovery is
dependent on NF-nB function. Importantly, the reexpression of
p21Cip1 is essential to block induction of apoptosis in these cells.
However, this role of p21Cip1 is cell type specific because we did not
observe these effects in Colo829 or A375 cells (data not shown).

Thus, although melanoma cells can be induced to die when
oncogenic BRAF signaling is inhibited, TNF-a attenuates the
induction of death. Critically, this allows the cells not only to
survive but also to recover and reenter the cell cycle, and consequently, in melanoma patients, inhibition of BRAF signaling could
be ineffective if cells of the immune system have infiltrated the
tumor and are secreting TNF-a.
The mechanisms underlying TNF-a-mediated recovery seem to
be regulated by NF-nB, a heterodimeric transcription factor mainly
composed of a p50 and a p65 subunit (15). NF-nB is maintained in
an inactive state in cells through its binding to an inhibitory
cytosolic anchor protein called inhibitor of NF-nB (InB). On
activation, InB is degraded through the proteasome, releasing
active NF-nB into the nucleus where it regulates gene expression.
NF-nB is implicated in a wide variety of cell responses, which in
part depend on cell type, context, and other signaling events. In
melanoma, constitutive NF-nB signaling is associated with survival,
angiogenesis, and metastasis and it is therefore implicated in
tumor maintenance and progression. We find that melanoma cells
have elevated basal NF-nB signaling, but this is insufficient to
reverse the death induced by inhibition of BRAF signaling, and
survival only occurs when NF-nB signaling is further enhanced by
TNF-a. We show that TNF-a activates NF-nB (Fig. 4) and the
importance of NF-nB is established by our RNAi depletion of the
p50 or p65 subunits, which block the ability of TNF-a to rescue
cells when BRAF signaling is inhibited. Furthermore, we show that
TNF-a stimulates increased p50 and p65 subunit levels in
melanoma cells, whereas PD184352 suppresses expression of these

Discussion
In this work, we have examined the interaction between death
receptor and BRAF signaling in melanoma. Both pathways play
a key role in the biology and progression of this disease and
we describe an intriguing interaction between these signaling
cascades. We have shown that inhibition of BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling in melanoma cells that harbor mutations in BRAF induces
cell death, whereas this does not occur when BRAF and RAS are
not mutated. This is consistent with recent findings showing
that cells that harbor BRAF mutations are significantly more
dependent on BRAF signaling than cells where BRAF is not mutated
(10, 11, 14). Importantly, we go on to show that the induction of
cell death that occurs when oncogenic BRAF signaling is blocked
can be reversed by the cytokine TNF-a. This is a specific response
because it is blocked by Enbrel, a specific TNF-a antagonist and
it is not seen when the cells are treated with TRAIL, FasL, IL-1, or
IL-6. Furthermore, TNF-a did not suppress the death induced by
the cytotoxic drugs cisplatin, nitrogen mustard, and thapsigargin.

example, ML-IAP is thought to cause resistance to apoptosis and
chemotherapy in some melanomas (19) and we are currently
attempting to identify the key NF-nB targets in Colo829 and A375
cells.
Our findings have important clinical implications because of the
crucial role that inflammation plays in the tumor microenvironment of melanoma. Several studies have shown that there is
significant infiltration of cells of the immune system into
melanomas, particularly macrophages and mast cells, both of
which are known to secrete TNF-a, IL-1, and IL-6 (20–22). TNF-a
plays a critical role in various cancers as shown, for example, by the
observation that TNF-a-null mice are resistant to murine models of
skin carcinogenesis (23). Furthermore, polymorphisms that elevate
TNF-a expression are associated with poor prognosis and
increased disease severity in cancers, such as non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (24). The intrinsic basal activity of NF-nB in melanoma
cells together with the high levels of invasive macrophages seen in
melanoma could account for the fact that NF-nB is constitutively
activated in most human melanomas (15), and importantly, the
invasion of cells of the immune system is associated with a poor
prognosis in invasive melanoma (22).
Several small molecular weight inhibitory drugs that target
either BRAF or its downstream effector MEK are in preclinical or
clinical development. The most advanced of these is sorafenib, a
broad specificity kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF, CRAF, and
RTKs, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(VEGFR) and c-kit (25). However, as a monotherapy, sorafenib
provides only a marginal clinical benefit in patients with melanoma
and its activity does not track with BRAF mutation status (26). The
reason for its lack of activity is unclear. Apparently, sorafenib is
not potent enough to target BRAF in melanoma patients and its
clinical activity is due to its anti-RTK activity. Indeed, the efficacy
of sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma patients is thought to arise
from its anti-VEGFR activity (25). Importantly, our data now
suggest an intriguing alternative interpretation. We suggest that

subunits (Fig. 5A) and we find that TNF-a induces InB degradation
(data not shown). We also find that BRAF seems to enhance the
NF-nB activity in these cells because inhibition of the pathway
using PD184352 caused a reduction in NF-nB-dependent luciferase
activity (Fig. 4A). Thus, the interplay between these pathways is
complex and may be regulated at many levels. Nevertheless, our
data show that the interaction between these pathways provides a
specific rescue that allows TNF-a to overcome the consequences of
BRAF signaling inhibition.
We have also shown that p21Cip1 is a critical NF-nB target that
mediates the effects of TNF-a in WM266.4 cell, but this is not a
universal function of p21Cip1 as it did not seem to play a role in
Colo829 or A375 cells (data not shown). The regulation of p21Cip1
expression in WM266.4 is complex. Its expression is blocked when
MEK is inhibited or when the cells are treated with TNF-a and yet
together these agents antagonize each other allowing p21Cip1
expression to recover in a NF-nB-dependent manner, as shown by
fact that p65 subunit prevents p21Cip1 reexpression. Furthermore,
our data show that depletion of p21Cip1 is not sufficient to induce
apoptosis because although TNF-a suppresses p21Cip1 expression,
it does not induce apoptosis. Thus, it seems that a reduction in
p21Cip1 protein levels is not sufficient to induce apoptosis in
WM266.4 cells but that p21Cip1 expression is essential to prevent
the induction of apoptosis when oncogenic BRAF-MEK signaling is
inhibited.
We posit that NF-nB is the critical transcription factor that
allows TNF-a to block apoptosis when BRAF signaling is inhibited
in melanoma cells. In WM266.4 cells, a key downstream target of
NF-nB is p21Cip1, but in the other cell lines, other targets
presumably mediate the effects of signaling through this pathway.
Our preliminary studies suggest that the prosurvival proteins BclXL,
Mcl-1, and XIAP do not play a role in mediating the survival of
melanoma cells, in which BRAF signaling is suppressed. However,
many of the other factors within these protein families are NF-nB
targets and are implicated in melanoma cell survival (15, 18). For

Where indicated, the cells were also transfected with RNAi oligonucleotides against p21Cip1, the p65 subunit of NF-nB, or a scrambled control.

TNF-a Prevents Melanoma Cell Death

vinblastine, and alkylating agents, such as temozolomide, agents
that all work through distinct mechanisms (18). Melanoma cells are
particularly resistant to most current forms of treatment and their
innate resistance to apoptosis is an enormous barrier to successful
treatment. We propose that the agents described above hold
enormous promise if combined with BRAF/MEK inhibitors to prime
melanoma cells for apoptosis. Further studies are warranted to test
the potential of these approaches.

TNF-a may present a significant barrier to the successful use of
anti-BRAF or anti-MEK therapies in melanoma. Although these
drugs will predispose melanoma cells to death, the prosurvival
activity of TNF-a could overcome this, causing these approaches to
fail.
We therefore propose that strategies that combine drugs that
target BRAF or MEK with agents that antagonize TNF-a could
provide an effective approach to treating melanoma because they
will both induce cell death and remove the rescue pathway provided
by TNF-a. Several agents that inhibit TNF-a are available. Biological
agents, such as Enbrel and infliximab, antagonize TNF-a by binding
to TNF-a or its receptors and are already approved for clinical use in
psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn’s disease (27, 28).
Alternatively, several widely used anti-inflammatory drugs that
target NF-nB, such as aspirin, sodium salicylate, or sulindac (18),
could also be tested. Finally, NF-nB could also be inhibited indirectly
by proteasome inhibitors, such as Valcade, Vinca alkaloids, such as
