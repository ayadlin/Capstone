Abstract
Gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva), which target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are
approved for treatment of patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients whose tumors
harbor mutations in the EGFR gene, including delE746-A750 in exon 19 and L858R in exon 21, may benefit in
particular from gefitinib treatment. However, acquired resistance to gefitinib has been a serious clinical problem, and further optimization is needed for application of EGFR-targeted drugs in lung cancer patients. In this
study, we established gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells from PC-9 cell line, which harbors the delE746-A750 mutation, by exposing the cell line to gefitinib for over 7 months. Gefitinib-resistant PC-9/GEFs cell lines showed
a marked downregulation of PTEN expression and increased Akt phosphorylation. In revertant, gefitinibsensitive clones (PC-9/Rev) derived from PC-9/GEF1-1 and PC-9/GEF2-1, PTEN expression, as well as sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib, was restored. Knockdown of PTEN expression using small interfering RNA
specific for PTEN in PC-9 cells resulted in drug resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib. Nuclear translocation
of the EGR1 transcription factor, which regulates PTEN expression, was shown to be suppressed in resistant
clones and restored in their revertant clones. Reduced PTEN expression was also seen in tumor samples from
a patient with gefitinib-refractory NSCLC. This study thus strongly suggests that loss of PTEN expression contributes to gefitinib and erlotinib resistance in NSCLC. Our findings reinforce the therapeutic importance of
PTEN expression in the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR-targeted drugs. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8715–25. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide (1, 2),
and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common
type of this disease. The development of drugs that target specific molecules, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, which target
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has improved
the efficacy of therapy for NSCLC. The presence of activating
EGFR mutations within the kinase domain of the EGFR gene
in NSCLC adenocarcinomas has a key role in determining the
therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-targeted drugs (3–5). We pre-

viously reported that activating EGFR mutations in lung
cancer cells selectively enhanced their EGF/transforming
growth factor α–independent growth capacity as well as
their susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of gefitinib (6).
Of the EGFR-driven signaling pathways that specifically
mediate the cytotoxicity and therapeutic efficacy of EGFRtargeted drugs, Akt signaling is rather more selectively
activated than extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
signaling in cells harboring mutant EGFRs to promote cell
survival in lung cancer cells (7). About 80% of tumors with
EGFR-activating mutations respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI). In NSCLC tumors, >90% of EGFR mutations
are located in exon 19 (delE746-A750) or 21 (L858R point
mutation). These activating EGFR mutations sensitize the
tumors to EGFR-targeted drugs and are often significantly
associated with an adenocarcinoma-associated histology,
smoking status, gender, and ethnicity (8, 9). Mok and colleagues
(10) recently reported that gefitinib is superior to carboplatinpaclitaxel as an initial treatment for NSCLC adenocarcinomas among nonsmokers or former light smokers in
eastern Asia.
In addition to these mutations in EGFR itself, various
other molecular mechanisms are involved in EGFR activation and responses to gefitinib, erlotinib, and other EGFRtargeted drugs (11, 12). Of the EGFR family of proteins, the
expression of HER3 and/or HER2 has been shown to affect

responses to EGFR-targeted drugs both in vitro and in vivo
(13–15). A secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been
identified that emerged after EGFR-TKI treatment (16–18),
whereas K-ras mutations have been reported to be linked to
primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs (19, 20). Amplification of
the Met gene and overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have been reported as mechanisms for the acquisition of resistance to EGFR-TKIs (21–23). Sos and
colleagues (24) recently reported that loss of PTEN expression contributed to erlotinib resistance by the activation of
downstream signaling pathways of EGFR in lung cancer, suggesting a possible involvement of PTEN downregulation and
Akt activation in the altered therapeutic efficacy of EGFRtargeted drugs. In addition to the mechanisms identified to
date, including activating EGFR mutations, activation of the
HGF/Met pathway, Ras mutations, and HER2/HER3 expression, further understanding of novel mechanisms that
control the sensitivity to and therapeutic efficacy of EGFRtargeted drugs is required for the development of a more
complete evidence base for therapeutics that are effective
in lung cancer patients.
In this study, we identified a novel mechanism for drug
resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib in NSCLC cell lines and
the relevant molecules involved. We established gefitinib resistant cell lines from the lung cancer–derived PC-9 cell line
harboring EGFR-activating mutations, and also their spontaneous revertants. We found that PTEN expression was
specifically lost in resistant cell lines and restored in their
drug-sensitive revertants. PTEN loss was observed in recurring NSCLC tumors harboring EGFR deletions after monotherapy with gefitinib. We investigated the possible
mechanism by which PTEN expression was lost in resistant
cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
PC-9, QG56, and 11-18 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere
of 5% CO2 (6, 14). Gefitinib was provided by AstraZeneca,
Inc., and erlotinib was provided by F. Hoffmann–La Roche
Ltd. SU11274 and anti–phospho-EGFR (pEGFR) antibodies
were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-HER2 and anti–
phospho-HER2 (pHER2) were from Upstate Biotechnology.
Anti-EGFR, anti–phospho-Met (pMet), anti–phospho-HER3
(pHER3), anti-ERK1/2, anti–phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2),
anti-Akt, anti–phospho-Akt (pAkt), anti-PTEN, and antiCREB antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Mutation-specific antibodies (delE746-A750 in exon
19, L858R in exon 21) were also purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-Met, anti-HER3, anti-EGR1, and
anti-HSP90 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti–β-actin antibody was purchased from
Abcam. The small interfering RNAs (siRNA) corresponding
to PTEN (5′-AUUGUCAUCUUCACUUAGCCAUUGG-3′) and
EGR1 (5′-UCCAGCUUAGGGUAGUUGUCCAUGG-3′) were
purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were transfected with

8716

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and
Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.
Plasmid construction
To obtain full-length cDNA sequences for human EGR1, PCR
was carried out with a SuperScript cDNA library (Invitrogen)
using the following primer pairs (single underlining indicates
the start and stop codon): 5′-ATGGCCGCG‐GCCAAGGCCGAGATG-3′ and 5′-TTAGCAAATTTCAAT‐TGTCCTGGGAGAAA-3′. This PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T
easy vector (Promega). To construct a plasmid expressing
HA-tagged EGR1, NH2-terminal HA-tagged EGR1 cDNA was
ligated into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen).
Cell proliferation assay
Exponentially growing cell suspensions (2–4 × 103/100 μL)
were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates per well. The following day, various concentrations of gefitinib, erlotinib, cisplatin, or SU11274 were added. After incubation for 72 hours
at 37°C, 20 μL of Cell Count Reagent SF (Nacalai Tesque)
were added to each well and the plates were incubated for
a further 1 to 2 hours at 37°C. Absorbance was measured
at 450 nm with a 96-well plate reader. Triplicate wells were
tested at each drug concentration. The IC50 value, defined as
the concentration giving a 50% reduction in absorbance, was
calculated from the survival curves.
Western blot analysis
Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Triton
X-100 buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 50
mmol/L NaF, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol containing
5 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate). Cell lysates were separated by
SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes
(Millipore Corp.). After transfer, membranes were incubated in blocking solution, probed with various antibodies,
washed, and visualized using horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)–conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare)
and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham).
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was reverse transcribed from random hexamers using
avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega).
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the RealTime PCR System 7300 (Applied Biosystems). In brief,
20 μL of PCR amplification reaction mixtures contained cDNA,
primer pairs (Applied Biosystems), a dual-labeled fluorogenic
probe (Applied Biosystems), and Taqman Universal PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycle conditions included maintaining the reactions at 50°C for 2 minutes and 95°C for 10 minutes, and then 40 cycles alternating
between 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. The relative gene expression for each sample was determined using
the formula 2(−ΔCt) = 2[Ct (GAPDH) − Ct (target)], which reflected
the target gene expression normalized to glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels.

Peptide nucleic acid–locked nucleic acid PCR clamp
method and direct DNA sequencing
Activating mutations of the EGFR gene in exons 19
(delE746-A750) and 21 (L858R) were examined by peptide
nucleic acid–locked nucleic acid (PNA-LNA) PCR clamp as
described previously (25, 26). In brief, genomic DNA was purified from paraffin-embedded tissue using a QIAamp DNA
Micro kit (Qiagen). The PCR primers used were synthesized
by Invitrogen. PNA clamp primers and LNA mutant probes
were purchased from FASMEC and IDT, respectively. The
PNA-LNA PCR clamp method used a SDS-7500 System
(Applied Biosystems). To analyze the T790M mutation, exon
20 of the EGFR gene was amplified using the PCR primer set
forward (5′-CATTCATGCGTCTTCACCTG-3′) and reverse
(5′-CATATCCCCATGGCAAACTC-3′) and TaKaRa Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa BIO, Inc.). PCR products were directly
used as templates for cycle sequencing reactions using the
BigDye Terminator v.1.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The forward or reverse primers were used for cycle
sequencing reactions, which were carried out in an ABI
PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer.
Immunohistochemistry
Informed consent for the use of tumor tissue specimens
was obtained from all patients or from their legal guardians,
as approved by the institution's ethics review board. Eight
patients had an acquired resistance after receiving gefitinib
therapy at University Hospital, University of Occupational
and Environmental Health, Japan, between 1995 and 2007
(27). Three gefitinib-refractory tumors were obtained from
pulmonary metastases in a patient who did not harbor the
T790M mutation in the EGFR gene. In this patient, three
separated metastatic pulmonary tumors were obtained by
a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which were located
in segments 5, 6, and 8 of the left lung. Paraffin-embedded
tissue samples were sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm,
mounted on coated glass slides, and labeled with anti-PTEN
antibody (DakoCytomation), pAkt antibody (Cell Signaling

Technology), EGR1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology),
and anti-Met antibody (Immuno-Biological Laboratories)
using the ChemMate ENVISION method (DakoCytomation).
The intensity of PTEN, pAkt, EGR1, and Met labeling was
assessed using the following scale: none (0), weak (1+),
moderate (2+), and strong (3+; ref. 26). All slides were evaluated by two experienced observers who were blinded to
the condition of the patients (A.K. and M.Ka.).
Mutation-specific EGFR antibodies recently developed by
Yu and colleagues (28) were used to specifically identify
L858R and delE746-A750 mutations (Cell Signaling Technology) and to analyze the expression of mutant EGFR in our
cell lines and clinical specimens (26). Cells were rinsed with
ice-cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for
30 minutes. After fixation, slides were briefly washed in water. Antigen retrieval was carried out by boiling for 30 minutes in 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 9.0) in a microwave. Intrinsic
peroxidase activity was blocked using Peroxidase Blocking
Reagent (Dako) for 5 minutes. After washing in TBS for 5
minutes, the slides were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted 1:100 at room temperature for 30 minutes. After
washing in TBS for 5 minutes, slides were incubated for 30
minutes with polymer HRP-labeled secondary antibody
(ChemMate ENVISION kit, Dako) at room temperature,
washed in TBS for 10 minutes, and then visualized using
3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Dako). Sections from clinical specimens were incubated with the primary antibodies at 4°C
overnight.

Results
Establishment and characterization of
gefitinib-resistant sublines
To isolate gefitinib-resistant sublines from PC-9 cells harboring the activating EGFR mutation delE746-A750, we cultured the cells in increasing doses of drug from 0.05 to
15 μmol/L, which were increased stepwise over 7 months.
We independently selected gefitinib-resistant cell lines from
two plastic culture flasks, which had been exposed to various
doses of the drug. We cloned three gefitinib-resistant sublines: PC-9/GEF1-1 from one flask, and PC-9/GEF2-1 and
PC-9/GEF2-2 from another flask. These three clones all
showed 70- to 300-fold higher resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib than the parental PC-9 cell line (Table 1). By contrast,
these resistant cells were as sensitive as PC-9 cells to the
non-EGFR–targeted drug, cisplatin, and the Met TKI,
SU11274 (Table 1).
Loss of PTEN expression and increased expression of
activated Akt in gefitinib-resistant cell lines
We compared the expression level and phosphorylation
status of EGFR, HER2, HER3, Met, PTEN, Akt, and ERK in
the gefitinib-resistant cell lines (PC-9/GEF cell lines) and
the parental PC-9 line by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A).
Compared with PC-9 cells, the drug-resistant cell lines expressed 30% to 50% lower levels of Met. However, the most
striking differences between the sensitive and resistant lines
were in PTEN protein expression and Akt phosphorylation

PTEN Loss in Gefitinib-Resistant NSCLC

(Fig. 1A). There was almost no expression of PTEN protein
and markedly increased phosphorylation of Akt in the
drug-resistant sublines compared with PC-9 cells. We further
examined if phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, and Akt was
susceptible to the inhibitory effect of gefitinib in the drugresistant cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1B, only phosphorylation of
Akt was resistant to gefitinib in resistant clones. By contrast,
phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2 remained sensitive to
gefitinib-resistant cell lines as PC-9. PC-9/GEF2-2 cell lines
also showed the same results (data not shown). Downregula-

tion of PTEN is thus mainly responsible for gefitinib resistance through altered phosphorylation status of Akt.
We analyzed the DNA sequences of these three resistant
cell lines for the T790M mutation, known to be associated
with secondarily acquired resistance, but this mutation was
not present (data not shown). Based on the recently developed antibodies specific for the delE746-A750 and L858R mutations (26, 28), we next asked whether the delE746-A750
mutation was conserved in the three drug-resistant sublines
by both immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis

(Fig. 1C and D). Both methodologies showed that the gefitinibresistant cell lines retained the delE746-A750 mutation, characteristic of the PC-9 cell line. We also confirmed this by direct
DNA sequencing of all three resistant lines (data not shown).
Isolation of drug-sensitive revertants from gefitinibresistant cell lines and PTEN expression
We continuously cultured two of the resistant cell lines,
PC-9/GEF1-1 and PC-9/GEF2-1, for ∼9 months in the absence of gefitinib. Cell lines PC-9/Rev1, derived from PC-9/
GEF1-1, and PC-9/Rev2, derived from PC-9/GEF2-1, were established and cloned. We compared their drug sensitivity
with that of their parental drug-resistant cell lines. A higher
sensitivity to gefitinib was restored in the PC-9/Rev1 and

PC-9/Rev2 cell lines compared with their drug-resistant counterparts (Fig. 2A), with IC50 values of 3.5 and 5.1 μmol/L for
PC-9/Rev1 and PC-9/Rev2, respectively, compared with 12.8
to 18.0 μmol/L for the PC-9/GEF cell lines (see Table 1).
These gefitinib-sensitive revertants and their parental drugresistant lines showed almost identical sensitivity to cisplatin
and SU11274: IC50/cisplatin values of 2.7 and 1.6 μmol/L for
PC-9/Rev1 and PC-9/Rev2, respectively; IC50/SU11274 values
of 4.8 and 4.2 μmol/L for PC-9/Rev1 and PC-9/Rev2, respectively. The sensitivity of these sublines to gefitinib and erlotinib was not completely restored to the level seen for PC-9
cells. However, Western blot analysis showed that PTEN
expression was completely restored in the revertant cell lines
and also Akt activation was reduced (Fig. 2B).

PTEN Loss in Gefitinib-Resistant NSCLC

Nuclear translocation of EGR1 is required for
PTEN expression
We next investigated the mechanism by which PTEN protein expression was downregulated in resistant cell lines.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed
markedly decreased expression of PTEN mRNA in all three
resistant sublines, PC-9/GEF1-1, PC-9/GEF2-1, and PC-9/
GEF2-2, and restored expression of PTEN mRNA in revertant
cell lines, PC-9/Rev1 and PC-9/Rev2, compared with PC-9
cells (Fig. 2C). As PTEN expression has been shown to be induced by the EGR1 transcription factor (29, 30), we analyzed
the possible role of EGR1 in the reduced expression of PTEN
in these cell lines. Compared with parental PC-9 cells, the
three resistant PC-9/GEF cell lines showed EGR1 expression
in the cytosolic fraction but lower in the nuclear fraction

(Fig. 2D). By contrast, the expression of nuclear EGR1 was
restored in the drug-sensitive revertant cell lines (Fig. 2D).
We further examined whether expression of EGR1 and PTEN
was affected by exposure to low dose of gefitinib in PC-9 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2,
and Akt was markedly blocked when PC-9 cells were exposed
to low doses of the drug for 1, 3, and 5 days. Under this condition, however, expression of PTEN was not changed by
treatment with gefitinib.
PTEN gene is transcriptionally regulated by Akt-EGR1PTEN axis (29), but EGR1 is also responsible for expression
of various other genes including cyclin D1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2),
and protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B; refs. 31–36).
We examined whether expression of cyclin D1, ICAM-1,

Figure 5. A model showing how resistance to
EGFR-targeted drugs is acquired as a result of
loss of PTEN expression through impaired
nuclear translocation of EGR1 in lung cancer
cells. A, continuous activation of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
pathway in cells harboring EGFR-activating
mutations (EGFRm) promotes cell survival.
PTEN is a negative regulator of PI3K/Akt
pathway, dephosphorylating PIP3, but the PI3K/
Akt pathway is constitutively activated by these
EGFR mutations, resulting in cell survival and
proliferation. B, EGFR-TKIs inhibit the activating
EGFR tyrosine kinase, which is accompanied
by a block of PI3K/Akt signaling, and results in
cell death when lung cancer cells harboring
EGFRm are treated with EGFR-TKI. C, loss of
PTEN expression further promotes the
activation of PI3K/Akt signaling, resulting in the
acquisition of resistance to EGFR-TKI and
thus in cell survival of drug-resistant lung
cancer cell lines such as PC-9/GEFs. In
drug-resistant cell lines, PTEN expression is
downregulated through impaired EGR1
translocation into the nucleus.

FGF2, and PTP1B was differentially altered between PC-9
and drug-resistant cell lines. Of the four genes examined,
mRNA expression of cyclin D1, ICAM-1, and FGF2 was downregulated in gefitinib-resistant cell lines and restored in these
drug-sensitive revertants to similar levels as PC-9 (Fig. 2E).
Some EGR1 target genes in addition to PTEN are regulated
under the control by impaired nuclear translocation of EGR1.
To further determine if EGR1 directly regulates PTEN expression, we examined the effect of EGR1 knockdown on PTEN
expression in PC-9 cells. Treatment with siRNA specific for
EGR1 induced a reduced level of PTEN expression (Supple-

with PTEN. We also examined whether expression of PTEN
could be restored by EGR1 overexpression in the PC-9/GEF
cells. The overexpression of EGR1, however, could not restore
PTEN expression in PC-9/GEF1-1 cells when transfected with
EGR1 cDNA (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

PTEN Loss in Gefitinib-Resistant NSCLC

assessed the effect of PTEN knockdown on sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib. Treatment with siRNA specific for PTEN
induced a reduced level of PTEN expression and increased
Akt phosphorylation in PC-9 cells (Fig. 3A). This knockdown
of PTEN expression also conferred resistance to gefitinib
compared with a control siRNA used in the same cell line
(Fig. 3B). The IC50 values for gefitinib were 0.025 μmol/L in
cells treated with 2 nmol/L control siRNA, 0.29 μmol/L in
cells treated with 0.4 nmol/L PTEN siRNA, and 1.1 μmol/L
in cells treated with 2 nmol/L PTEN siRNA. Similar results
were obtained in PC-9 cells with erlotinib (Fig. 3C), which
showed IC50 values of 0.037 μmol/L in cells treated with
2 nmol/L control siRNA, 0.18 μmol/L in cells treated with
0.4 nmol/L PTEN siRNA, and 0.72 μmol/L in cells treated
with 2 nmol/L PTEN siRNA.
Loss of PTEN expression in patients with gefitinibrefractory NSCLC
We finally examined whether such PTEN loss was observed in NSCLC patients who are refractory to monotherapy
by gefitinib. We screened expression of PTEN in tumors from
patients showing acquired resistance to gefitinib (27) by immunohistochemical analysis. During screening of 10 refractory tumors without T790M mutation, Met gene amplification,
HGF overexpression, and K-ras mutations, we found one refractory tumor showing low expression of PTEN. As shown in
Fig. 4, three gefitinib-refractory tumors were obtained from
three different pulmonary metastatic foci in a patient who
had received monotherapy with gefitinib. Both the patient's
primary tumor, before treatment, and the three refractory tumors harbored the EGFR delE746-A750 mutation. However,
PTEN expression was markedly lower in these three refractory tumors compared with the tumor before gefitinib treatment, and Akt phosphorylation was apparently enhanced
in tumors 1 and 2, but was not apparent in tumor 3. The
expression levels of Met were lower in three refractory
tumors (Fig. 4).
Immunohistochemical analysis with anti-EGR1 antibody
showed that EGR1 was expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm of many cancer cells in both primary tumor and refractory tumors (Fig. 4). EGR1 was also expressed in other
cell types of tumor stroma. However, there was no apparent
difference in expression levels of EGR1 between the primary
tumor and refractory tumors. It remains to be further studied whether EGR1 expression in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm is correlated with PTEN expression in clinical tumor
samples.

Discussion
The deletion or inactivation of PTEN is often seen in a variety of tumor types, including lung, bladder, renal, breast,
endometrial, melanoma, and thyroid, and there are no other
family members that can replace PTEN function (37). Furthermore, the role of PTEN is an important one because its
loss results in the misregulation of multiple Akt-dependent
and Akt-independent pathways critical for the progression
of malignant cancers (37). In this study, we have shown that

www.aacrjournals.org

the loss of PTEN expression was critical for the acquisition of
resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs, such as gefitinib and
erlotinib, in lung cancer cells (Fig. 5) based on the following
evidence: (a) the gefitinib-resistant PC-9/GEF sublines, derived from the NSCLC PC-9 cell line harboring the drugsensitive EGFR delE746-A750 mutation, showed much lower
PTEN expression than the parental PC-9 cells; (b) PTEN expression was restored in gefitinib-sensitive PC-9/Rev revertants, derived from the resistant sublines, to levels
comparable with those seen in the parental PC-9 cells; (c) nuclear translocation of EGR1, a critical transcription factor in
PTEN expression, was markedly inhibited in drug-resistant
cell lines and was restored in revertant cells; (d) knockdown
of PTEN conferred resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib in
lung cancer cells; and (e) secondary gefitinib-refractory
metastases from a patient with NSCLC who had been treated
with gefitinib showed lower expression of PTEN than the
same patient's primary tumor, removed before treatment.
In our gefitinib-resistant PC-9/GEF sublines and gefitinibsensitive PC-9/Rev revertants, the cellular levels of functional
PTEN expression and Akt activation were closely correlated.
This close coupling of PTEN-Akt signaling confers prolonged
cell survival through constitutive Akt activation and acquisition of resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs (Fig. 5). PTEN expression itself is important for predicting the therapeutic
efficacy of gefitinib in NSCLC patients (38). The acquisition
of gefitinib resistance as a result of PTEN loss can be overcome by restoring PTEN function or by inhibiting the constitutive activation of Akt (39). Sos and colleagues (24) have
recently reported the critical role played by both PTEN loss
and Akt activation in resistance to erlotinib in lung cancer
cells. Taken together, these results show that the Akt signaling pathway is critical in the effects that PTEN loss has on
cell survival and sensitivity to EGFR-targeted drugs.
Revertant drug-sensitive sublines were isolated after the
prolonged culture of gefitinib-resistant cells in the absence
of the drug, and showed a 3- to 4-fold higher sensitivity to
gefitinib than the drug-resistant cell lines, indicating that
drug sensitivity in these sublines could be partially recovered.
However, expression of PTEN was almost completely restored to the levels seen in the parental PC-9 cells. During
the acquisition of 200- to 300-fold higher drug resistance, after long exposure to the drug, changes in the expression of
multiple factors, including PTEN, and other growth factor receptors might be expected to be modulated. PTEN loss thus
might be one of several altered pathways that could be involved in the acquisition of drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
The loss of PTEN expression has been reported to be in
part due to the methylation of the PTEN gene promoter
in some tumors (40–42). However, treating the gefitinibresistant cell lines with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
or histone deacetylase inhibitors did not affect the expression of PTEN,7 suggesting that the methylation status of
the PTEN promoter is not likely to be associated with PTEN

expression loss in our resistant sublines. The expression of
PTEN has also been reported to be regulated by the EGR1
transcription factor, and three EGR1-binding sites have been
identified in the PTEN gene promoter (29, 30, 43). In this
study, we showed a close correlation between PTEN expression and EGR1 expression in drug-resistant PC-9/GEF cells,
suggesting that the nuclear translocation of EGR1 directly
regulates the expression of PTEN: EGR1 activates transcription of the PTEN gene through binding to its consensus motif
in the promoter (44). Our present study showed downregulation of some EGR1 target genes, cyclin D1, FGF2, and ICAM-1,
but not other EGR1 target gene, PTP1B (Fig. 2E). Together,
whether expression of PTEN or other EGR1 target genes
could be upregulated or downregulated might in part depend
on how activation of EGR1 is controlled in response to environmental stimuli. Exposure of PC-9 cells to low doses of gefitinib up to 5 days resulted in unchanged expression of
PTEN (Supplementary Fig. S1). Because gefitinib-resistant
cell lines were selected after stepwise exposure to increasing
doses of the drug for 6 to 8 months, continuous exposure for
longer periods might be required to induce loss of both PTEN
expression and nuclear EGR1 translocation. However, it remains unclear how nuclear translocation of EGR1 is specifically blocked by acquirement of drug resistance to gefitinib.
Further elucidation of relevant underlying mechanisms at
molecular basis should be required.
In both immunocytochemical and Western blot analyses
using EGFR mutation-specific antibodies (26, 28), the EGFR
delE746-A750 mutation was found to be conserved in PC-9/
GEFs (Fig. 1C and D), suggesting that there was no change in
the original EGFR deletion mutation that sensitizes the effect
of gefitinib under selection by drug resistance. Onitsuka and
colleagues (27) have recently characterized 10 NSCLC patients showing acquired resistance to monotherapy by gefitinib. In the primary tumor, T790M was observed in 7, and
HGF overexpression was observed in 5, of 10 refractory tumors. In one refractory patient, immunohistochemical analysis showed that PTEN was expressed in cancer cells
harboring the delE746-A750 mutation, both in the primary
tumor before treatment and also in the secondary refractory

tumors after treatment with gefitinib (Fig. 4). Immunohistochemical analysis also showed that Met and EGFR were
expressed in both the primary tumor, before gefitinib treatment, and in the refractory tumors derived from three metastatic foci from the lung of this patient. By contrast, PTEN
expression was much lower in the refractory tumors than
the primary tumor, and Akt phosphorylation was much higher
in two of the refractory tumors (Fig. 4). About the frequency
of PTEN loss, Sos and colleagues (24) have reported
co-occurrence of homozygous gene deletion of PTEN and
EGFR mutation in 1 of 24 clinical NSCLC samples with EGFR
mutations. It seems likely that PTEN loss is less frequent
compared with T790M, HGF expression, and Met amplification. To evaluate the frequency of PTEN loss in gefitinib- or
erlotinib-resistant tumors, quantitative analysis will be required with large number of refractory tumors.
In conclusion, we selected gefitinib-resistant cell lines
from PC-9 cells harboring an activating EGFR mutation
and observed PTEN loss in these resistant cell lines. PTEN
loss was also observed in one NSCLC patient who had
become refractory to gefitinib treatment. Together with recent results published by another group (24, 38, 39), loss of
PTEN expression together with Akt activation could act as a
predictive marker for a therapeutic response to EGFRtargeted drugs.
