Abstract

Author Manuscript

The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is activated in human breast cancer
tissues and cell lines. However, it is unclear whether NF-κB activation is a consequence of tumor
formation or a contributor to tumor development.

Author Manuscript

We developed a doxycycline-inducible mouse model, termed DNMP, to inhibit NF-κB activity
specifically within the mammary epithelium during tumor development in the polyoma middle T
oncogene (PyVT) mouse mammary tumor model. DNMP females and PyVT littermate controls
were treated with doxycycline from 4 to 12 weeks of age. We observed an increase in tumor
latency and a decrease in final tumor burden in DNMP mice compared to PyVT controls. A
similar effect with treatment from 8 to 12 weeks indicates that outcome is independent of effects
on postnatal virgin ductal development. In both cases, DNMP mice were less likely to develop
lung metastases than controls. Treatment from 8 to 9 weeks was sufficient to impact primary
tumor formation. Inhibition of NF-κB increases apoptosis in hyperplastic stages of tumor
development and decreases proliferation at least in part by reducing CyclinD1 expression. To test
the therapeutic potential of NF-κB inhibition, we generated palpable tumors by orthotopic
injection of PyVT cells and then treated systemically with the NF-κB inhibitor thymoquinone
(TQ). TQ treatment resulted in a reduction in tumor volume and weight as compared to vehicletreated control. This data indicates that epithelial NF-κB is an active contributor to tumor

Introduction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To aid discovery of new therapeutics, additional investigation into molecular factors
responsible for breast cancer development and progression is required. Nuclear factor kappa
B (NF-κB) is a transcriptional regulator of proteins that modulate survival, proliferation,
angiogenesis and metastasis (Baud and Karin, 2009). NF-κB is activated in human breast
cancer tissues and cell lines (Nakshatri et al., 1997; Sovak et al., 1997; Biswas et al., 2004).
However, the precise roles played by NF-κB during breast tumor development have not
been extensively investigated in vivo. In particular, the role of NF-κB activity specifically
within epithelial cells has not been studied. The transcription factor NF-κB is a dimer
formed from a multi-subunit family consisting of p65 (Rel A), Rel B, c-Rel, p105/p50 (NFκB1), and p100/p52 (NF-κB2) (Ghosh et al., 1998; Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009).
Activation of NF-κB is regulated by the binding of inhibitory proteins termed IκBs
(Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1988; Hayden and Ghosh, 2008). In the canonical NF-κB
pathway, a dimer composed of the p65 and p50 subunits is held in the cytosol through
binding of the inhibitor IκBα. The phosphorylation of IκBα by IκB Kinase 2 (IKK2) acts as
a signal for the ubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor. p50/p65 then translocates to
the nucleus and binds to the promoter of target genes (Baldwin, 1996; Ghosh et al., 1998;
Hayden and Ghosh, 2008).
Many investigations concerning activation of NF-κB in human breast cancer cells in vitro
have focused on a role of NF-κB in providing resistance to chemotherapeutics. Expression
of a super repressor of IκBα in MDA-MB-231 cells increases sensitivity to paclitaxelinduced apoptosis (Patel et al., 2000). Doxorubicin treatment increases NF-κB activity in
BT-474 human breast cancer cells and treatment of cells with siRNA against NF-κB
subunits p65, p52 and c-Rel leads to a 30–40% increase in doxorubicin toxicity (Tapia et al.,
2007). While these studies illustrate the potential for inhibition of NF-κB in chemoresistant
tumors they do not determine the role of NF-κB in tumor development.

Author Manuscript

Few studies have investigated the contribution of NF-κB activity to tumor progression in
vivo. MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells treated with a dominant negative IKK2
construct prevented xenograft tumor growth in nude mice (Singh et al., 2007). A similar
reduction in tumor formation was observed in a study where NAFA murine mammary tumor
cells transfected with a dominant negative IκBα construct were injected subcutaneously into
FVB mice (Liu et al., 2009). While these studies suggest that NF-κB may contribute to
mammary tumor progression, in both cases cells were injected into areas distinct from the
mammary gland such that, the models may not accurately represent the appropriate
microenvironment for mammary tumor progression. More importantly, both studies used

established tumor cell lines so do not address the role of NF-κB activity during the early
process of cellular transformation. More relevant to this question was a recent study in
which a dominant inhibitor of NF-κB, similar to that used here, was targeted directly to the
mammary epithelium under the control of the MMTV promoter and mice subjected to
systemic chemical carcinogenesis with MPA/DMBA (Pratt et al., 2009). While NF-κB
inhibition had no effect on squamous lesions, induction of mammary luminal lesions was
reduced.

Author Manuscript

In the current study we have developed an inducible mouse model that allows us to inhibit
NF-κB activity specifically within mammary epithelial cells in vivo as they are transformed
and in discrete stages during tumor progression which we define as the continuum from
benign lesion initiated by oncogene expression to malignant tumor. We used the polyoma
middle T oncogene (PyVT) transgenic model that effectively represents human mammary
tumor development (Lin et al., 2003). We recently generated a transgenic model in which
doxycycline (dox) treatment allows the MMTV-reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) to
drive inducible mammary epithelial specific expression of a mutated form of IκBα that acts
a dominant inhibitor of NF-κB activity (Connelly et al., 2010). In the current study, we have
combined these models to generate triple transgenics, termed DNMP, in which NF-κB
activity can be inhibited by dox treatment in defined windows during PyVT induced
tumorigenesis. Using this new model we demonstrate that inhibition of NF-κB signaling
leads to increased tumor latency and decreased tumor burden. In addition, we demonstrate
that significant inhibition of tumor progression can be achieved even after initiation of
primary tumor formation. This is mediated by an increase in apoptosis in early stage tumors
and an inhibition of proliferation throughout tumor development. In an additional model, we
demonstrate that systemic inhibition of NF-κB by Thymoquinone (TQ) also inhibits
mammary tumor progression. This data shows that NF-κB is an active contributor to tumor
progression, not merely up-regulated as a result of tumor formation, and provides in vivo
evidence that inhibition of NF-κB may be an effective therapeutic strategy.

Results
Increased NF-κB activity is associated with mammary tumor development in the PyVT
model

Author Manuscript

The PyVT mouse mammary tumor model recapitulates the stages of human disease (Lin et
al., 2003), however it not known whether this includes activation of NF-κB. Mammary
gland nuclear extracts were prepared and western blot performed for the NF-κB p65 subunit
as nuclear translocation of p65 indicates NF-κB activation. An increase in nuclear p65 levels
was observed in extracts from 7 week old PyVT mice as compared to control. This increase
reached significance in extracts from 12 week old PyVT (Figure 1A). We observed
phosphorylation of IκBα in orthotopic tumors grown with polyoma mouse mammary tumor
cells but not in normal mammary tissue (Figure 1B). These studies confirmed that NF-κB is
activated in PyVT tumors which represent an appropriate model to investigate effects of
inhibiting NF-κB during mammary tumorigenesis.
We developed a modular transgenic mouse model to investigate the effects of inhibiting NFκB in the mammary epithelium during tumorigenesis. The model combines three transgenes,

MMTV-rtTA, (tet-O)7-IκB-αDN-Myc-His and PyVT such that treatment of DNMP females
with dox induces mammary epithelial expression of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB-αDN on the
PyVT background. We have previously used this transgene to inhibit NF-κB activity
(Connelly et al., 2010). Littermates lacking the MMTV-rtTA transgene were used as
controls (PyVT controls).
Characterization of DNMP mice

Author Manuscript

DNMP mice and PyVT control littermates were treated with dox from 4 to 12 weeks.
Mammary glands were harvested and western blots performed on whole cell extracts to
detect expression of the myc-tagged DN-IκBα transgene. Expression of the transgene was
observed in DNMP mammary glands and was undetectable in PyVT controls (Figure 1C).
Transgene expression was observed in mammary gland but not in the heart, lung, liver,
kidney or salivary glands of dox-treated DNMP mice (Figure 1C). To confirm inhibition,
western blot for NF-κB p65 was performed on nuclear extracts from mammary glands of
DNMP and PyVT control mice treated with dox from 8 to 9 weeks of age. A significant
decrease in nuclear levels of p65 was apparent in DNMP mice compared with PyVT
controls (Figure 1D). This demonstrates that the DN-IκBα transgene is expressed
specifically within mammary and functions to inhibit NF-κB activity.
An increase in tumor latency and a reduction in tumor burden is observed in DNMP mice
treated with dox from 4 to 12 weeks old

Author Manuscript

DNMP mice and PyVT controls were treated with dox from 4 to 12 weeks of age, i.e.
encompassing primary tumor development through to metastasis to the lungs. There was a
significant increase in tumor latency in DNMP mice as compared to PyVT controls (Figure
2A). Control mice and DNMP mice developed palpable tumors with a median time of 33
days or 43 days from dox administration respectively (p<0.05; control n=7 and DNMP
n=13). This was accompanied by a reduction in final palpable tumor number (Figure 2B)
and in mammary tumor burden (Figure 2C) in DNMP mice upon sacrifice at 12 weeks old.
There was also a reduction in the number of lung metastases with 60% of PyVT controls
having surface lung metastases as compared with only 15% of DNMP (Figure 2D). Thus,
inhibition of NF-κB within the mammary epithelium throughout progression to metastasis
has a significant impact on tumor burden.
Tumor progression is impacted by inhibition of NF-κB activity in the absence of effects on
postnatal development

Author Manuscript

As NF-κB signaling could impact postnatal virgin ductal development we examined
mammary gland whole mounts from DNMP and PyVT controls treated from 4 to 12 weeks
with dox. This revealed reduced ductal invasion into the mammary fat pads in DNMP mice
suggesting that the transgene may inhibit ductal development (Figure 3A). By 8 weeks of
age virgin postnatal development is complete with ductal branching having extended
throughout the mammary fat pad. Therefore, DNMP mice and PyVT controls were treated
with dox from 8 to 12 weeks. No difference in ductal invasion was observed in DNMP mice
versus control PyVT for this treatment time frame (Figure 3A).

Dox treatment from 8 to 12 weeks led to a significant increase in tumor latency in DNMP
mice as compared to PyVT controls (Figure 3B). PyVT controls and DNMP mice developed
palpable tumors with a median time of 11 days or 16 days from dox administration
respectively (p<0.05; control n=9 and DNMP n=7). This was again accompanied by a
decrease in mammary gland palpable tumor number (Figure 3C) and tumor burden (Figure
3D). An absence of metastasis was observed with no surface lung tumors found in DNMP
mice (Figure 3E). This data suggests that the impact of NF-κB inhibition observed on tumor
progression is not dependent on developmental effects.
Inhibition of NF-κB signaling leads to increased apoptosis during early stages of
tumorigenesis

Author Manuscript

We treated DNMP and PyVT controls with dox from 8 to 9 weeks old to capture a period
when signaling changes are occurring that would result in decreases in tumor burden at later
stages. Whole mount analyses from DNMP and PyVT controls treated from 8 to 9 weeks of
age demonstrate a dramatic reduction in tumor formation in DNMP mice (Figure 4A).
As NF-κB is known to up-regulate expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Karin and BenNeriah, 2000) we performed TUNEL staining to determine if levels of apoptosis were
changed at week 9 after a single week of transgene induction. Analysis of TUNEL staining
by tumor stage revealed an increase in apoptosis in hyperplastic lesions in DNMP mice
versus PyVT controls (Figure 4B). Quantification of numbers of macrophages in
hyperplastic lesions by immunohistochemistry shows an increase in this population in
DNMP mammary compared to controls (Figure 4C). It is likely that there is an increased
infiltration of macrophages in order to phagocytose the apoptotic cells.

Author Manuscript

Since we had observed an effect on apoptosis during the early stages of tumorigenesis, but
not during later stages, we investigated whether this effect was related to a differential
expression of the transgene. We performed immunohistochemistry for myc-tagged transgene
expression (Figure 4D). Analyses in DNMP mammary glands treated with dox from 8 to 9
weeks of age revealed a mosaic pattern of transgene expression. Interestingly, stronger
staining was observed in areas of normal tissue and in adenomas than at later stages. The
lack of significant effects on apoptosis during early and late carcinoma may be due to the
pattern of transgene expression.
Inhibition of NF-κB signaling reduces proliferation and Cyclin D1 expression during
mammary tumor progression

Author Manuscript

As NF-κB is known to regulate the expression of proteins involved in proliferation (Baud
and Karin, 2009), the effect of DN-IκBα expression on proliferation was investigated in
DNMP and PyVT control mammary glands treated with dox from 8 to 9 weeks.
Immunohistochemistry and quantification of cells positive for the proliferation-associated
antigen Ki67 revealed a significant reduction in proliferation in DNMP mammary (Figure
5A). To look more specifically at effects on mitosis, sections from DNMP and PyVT control
glands from mice treated with dox from 8 to 9 weeks were stained for phosphohistone 3. A
significant reduction in phospho-histone 3 was observed in DNMP glands as compared with
controls indicating a reduction in cells undergoing mitosis (Figure 5B). The cell cycle

regulatory protein Cyclin D1 is a key step in cell cycle progression and is up-regulated in
human breast cancers (Roy and Thompson, 2006). Increased expression of Cyclin D1 is
linked with up-regulation of NF-κB activity in the mammary gland (Cao and Karin, 2003).
Western blot for Cyclin D1 in mammary glands from mice treated from 8 to 9 weeks old
with dox revealed a significant decrease in Cyclin D1 protein in DNMP mice (Figure 5C).
This data suggests that NF-κB signaling in the epithelium during tumor progression may
regulate Cyclin D1 expression as one mechanism to effect proliferation.
NF-κB activity has been linked with promotion of angiogenesis (Liu et al., 2009). We
detected no significant differences between DNMP and PyVT control mammary glands
treated with dox from 8 to 9 weeks old in levels of Von Willebrand Factor by
immunohistochemistry or in mRNA levels of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
by real time PCR (data not shown).

Treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor thymoquinone (TQ) inhibits mammary tumor growth

Author Manuscript

Our transgenic model shows that inhibition of NF-κB activity can inhibit mammary tumor
progression. To extend the translational potential of our findings we investigated the impact
of systemic NF-κB inhibition on tumor growth. We generated a cell line (PYG129) from a
mammary tumor arising in a PyVT transgenic crossed with an NF-κB/luciferase NGL
reporter transgenic (Everhart et al., 2006). These cells were injected via the tail vein into a
wild type recipient and a second cell line (L129) was derived from the metastases that
formed in the mouse lung. The plant derivative thymoquinone (TQ) has been shown to
inhibit NF-κB activity and is being investigated as an anti-cancer treatment (Sethi et al.,
2008; Jafri et al.). We treated L129 cells with 10ng/ml TNF-α in the presence or absence of
50μM TQ for 6 hours and measured NF-κB activity by luciferase assay. A significant
reduction in NF-κB activity was observed in the presence of TQ (Figure 6A).
Orthotopic injection of 1 × 106 L129 cells into the mammary fat pad of wild type mice led to
the formation of a palpable mammary tumor within approximately 7 days. Following
detection of a palpable tumor, mice were treated daily by IP injection with 40mg/kg TQ or
DMSO vehicle control. TQ treated tumor volumes were lower as compared with the control
group (Figure 6B). This was accompanied by a significant reduction in final tumor weight in
TQ treated mice (Figure 6C). Similar results were obtained with a second PyVT tumor cell
line (data not shown). This data demonstrates that systemic treatment with an NF-κB
inhibitor delays tumor expansion.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

The activation of NF-κB is observed in human breast cancers but whether this transcription
factor functionally contributes to disease progression has not been extensively investigated.
We have developed a new inducible transgenic mouse model in which NF-κB signaling can
be inhibited in the mammary epithelium at specific times during tumor progression in the
PyVT mouse mammary tumor model. This allows us to investigate whether NF-κB is an
active contributor to tumor development. In initial studies we examined the effects of NFκB inhibition from 4 until 12 weeks old encompassing the time period from which primary
mammary tumors form to metastasis to the lungs in the PyVT model (Lin et al., 2003). We

observed a significant inhibition of tumor progression. However, our data and other reports
suggested that there may be an effect on development of the virgin gland (Brantley et al.,
2001; Hennighausen and Robinson, 2005). To exclude developmental effects from those on
tumorigenesis, we inhibited NF-κB from 8 to 12 weeks. Again we observed an increase in
tumor latency and a decrease in tumor burden. This suggests that inhibition of NF-κB
activity can impact mammary tumor progression independently of effects on development.

Author Manuscript

In both studies, reduced primary tumor burden was accompanied by a reduced endpoint
number of lung metastases. We and others have previously shown that inhibition of NF-κB
in the lung epithelium leads to a reduction in lung tumorigenesis (Stathopoulos et al., 2007;
Meylan et al., 2009; Basseres et al. 2010) demonstrating that modulation of NF-κB can
impact tumor formation in the lung microenvironment. NF-κB modulates expression of
genes involved in metastasis such as matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (Bond et al., 1998;
Han et al., 2001) therefore an effect on metastasis could be predicted. However, as the
current study demonstrates a significant decrease in primary tumor burden, it is possible that
the observed decrease in the number of lung metastases stems from decreased seeding from
a smaller primary tumor. We are unable to distinguish putative effects on metastasis from
those on primary tumor, thus further investigation will be required to establish a direct effect
on lung metastasis.

Author Manuscript

Investigation into the mechanisms responsible for the reduction in primary tumor growth
revealed an increase in apoptosis in early stage tumors. This is in agreement with in vitro
studies where NF-κB inhibition has been shown to promote apoptosis in human breast
cancer cells (Singh et al., 2007). NF-κB activity promotes survival in HeLa cells after
mitotic cell cycle arrest is induced by anti-microtubule drugs by blocking apoptosis (Mistry
et al., 2004). Our data indicates that NF-κB may protect hyperplastic cells from apoptosis,
allowing them to progress to carcinoma.
Mice in which Cyclin D1 expression is driven by the MMTV promoter develop mammary
adenocarcinomas suggesting that elevated Cyclin D1 contributes to tumor development
(Wang et al., 1994). Cyclin D1 is up-regulated in human breast cancers and regulates the
transition from G1 to S phase (Fu et al., 2004; Roy and Thompson, 2006); therefore NF-κB
may up-regulate Cyclin D1 and contribute to proliferation. Our model reveals that inhibition
of NF-κB signaling leads to a reduction in Cyclin D1 accompanied by a decrease in
proliferation. We also observed a reduction of phosphorylated histone 3 indicating less cells
were undergoing mitosis. Inhibition of NF-κB in HeLa cells has been shown to delay mitotic
entry (Cude et al., 2007), therefore inhibition of NF-κB may impact several stages of cell
cycle progression.

In a recent study, a reduction in subcutaneous tumor growth, tumor microvascular density
and VEGF was observed when NAFA murine mammary epithelial cells were stably
transfected with a stabilized form of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα (Liu et al., 2009). We did not
observe effects on tumor vessel density or the expression of VEGF (data not shown). One
explanation could be the differences between tumors growing in the microenvironment of
the mammary gland compared with a subcutaneous tumor.

In a previous study, inhibition of NF-κB signaling with a dominant negative IKK1 protein
did not impact tumor latency or number in the PyVT model but retarded tumor development
in the MMTV-c-neu (Erb2/Her2) model (Cao et al., 2007). NF-κB activity has been linked
with HER-2 positive tumors (Biswas and Iglehart, 2006) therefore further investigation is
required in this subtype of tumors.

Author Manuscript

Pratt et al (Pratt et al., 2009) targeted mutant IκBα to mammary epithelium using the
MMTV promoter. There are significant differences between their studies and the current
study. They used chemical carcinogen treatment to induce tumor development while the
current study focused on expression of an oncogenic signal, potentially more closely
modeling an inherited genetic mutation. The previous study used constitutive mammary
epithelial expression mediated via the MMTV promoter whereas our model is inducible,
making feasible investigation of specific temporal windows of intervention. The ability to
inhibit NF-κB at later stages during tumor progression allowed us to investigate effects after
the stage of postnatal development. The general conclusion from both studies is that
inhibition of NF-κB can impact breast tumor progression in a potentially therapeutic
manner.
In addition to the experiments performed with the DNMP model, we investigated the effect
of systemic treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor TQ on orthotopic mammary tumor
progression. This data is in agreement with that of our transgenic model. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first in vivo evidence suggesting that NF-κB inhibition by systemic
treatment with TQ has potential for treatment of existing mammary tumors.

Author Manuscript

The current study suggests that NF-κB activity within mammary epithelium contributes to
tumor progression in the murine mammary gland. The inhibition of NF-κB decreases
primary tumor load and results in decreased numbers of lung metastases. The effect of NFκB during tumor progression appears to be inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of
proliferation via Cyclin D1 signaling. These results are relevant to current efforts aimed at
developing inhibitors of NF-κB for treatment of cancer (Baud and Karin, 2009). They
demonstrate that inhibition of NF-κB in vivo during primary mammary gland tumor
development can be effective in blocking primary tumor progression with consequent effects
on the extent of metastasis to the lung. The observation that inhibition of NF-κB signaling
for a single week significantly decreases tumor load in a time frame where primary tumors
have already developed as a result of a strong oncogenic stimulus is particularly interesting.
As this models the clinical situation in which a patient is likely to present, we provide
evidence that inhibition of NF-κB may prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy for
treating patients with an existing breast tumor.

into the tail vein of an FVB mouse. After 6 weeks, lungs were harvested and a single tumor
dissected out and L129 cells derived as above.
0.5 × 106 cells/well were plated in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 hours. Cells were
treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) in the presence or
absence of 50μM Thymoquinone (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Solon, OH) for 6 hours. For TQ
plus TNF-α treatment, cells were pretreated for 1 hr with TQ, medium removed and
replaced with TQ plus TNF-α for the 6 hr treatment. Medium was removed and cells were
washed with PBS before addition of Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The extracts
were then centrifuged (13,793 × g, 4 °C, 5 min) and supernatants retained. Luciferase
activity was measured as described (Connelly et al., 2007).

Mouse models

Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. All mice were on an FVB strain background. MMTV-rtTA mice
(Gunther et al., 2002) were crossed with the PyVT mouse mammary tumor model. MMTVrtTA/PyVT mice were crossed with mice containing the NF-κB inhibiting (tet-O)7-IκBαDN-Myc-His construct (Cheng et al., 2007; Connelly et al., 2010) to obtain mice carrying
all three transgenes, these were termed DNMP. Littermates carrying the PyVT and DNIκBα transgenes but lacking the MMTV-rtTA transgene were used as controls. DNMP mice
(and controls) were treated with 2g/L freshly prepared doxycycline (dox; Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO) in drinking water from 4 to 12 weeks, 8 to 12 weeks or 8 to 9 weeks old.
Sucrose (5%) was added to decrease the bitter taste of dox water. A red bottle was used to
prevent light-induced dox degradation and water was replaced twice weekly. DNMP mice
(and controls) treated with dox from 4 to 12 weeks or 8 to 12 weeks were palpated twice
weekly from 7 weeks of age to check for tumor formation. Tumor latency was determined as
the day a tumor was first palpated from the start of dox treatment. At the time of sacrifice,
palpable tumors were counted and mammary glands weighed to determine total gland mass
(g).
Orthotopic injection of L129 cells and TQ treatment

Author Manuscript

Female FVB mice were injected in the right #4 inguinal mammary fat pad with 1 × 106
L129 cells in PBS. Daily IP injections of TQ (40 mg/kg) in DMSO or vehicle control were
begun at day 10 post injection of cells when tumors were approximately 150mm3. On every
second day tumor volume was measured with calipers. Body weight of each mouse was
measured daily, no toxicity was observed. At sacrifice, tumors were weighed to determine
mass (g).
Quantification of lung metastases
Lungs of mice treated from 4 to 12 weeks or 8 to 12 weeks of age with dox were inflated at
the time of sacrifice with Bouin's fixative. Surface tumors were counted by two blinded
readers under a dissecting microscope and counts averaged.

Number four inguinal mammary glands of mice treated from 8–9 weeks of age were fixed in
10% formalin overnight at 4°C. Glands were then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series
followed by xylenes and embedded in paraffin. 5μm sections were prepared and stained for

magnification using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and total Ki67 positive cells and total
nuclei per field were counted by two blinded readers. Additional 5μm sections were assessed
for apoptosis using the Deadend Fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega, Madison, WI).
Staining was performed utilizing rabbit anti-Phospho-Histone 3 primary antibody (Upstate Millipore, Danvers, MA) along with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary
antibody (Invitrogen), rat anti-F4/80 primary antibody (Invitrogen) along with goat anti-rat
FITC conjugated secondary antibody (AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC) and mouse anti-c-myc
primary antibody (Sigma) along with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated

For TUNEL quantification, 3 images from each of the 4 different stages of tumor
progression were captured per slide using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope at 20×
magnification. Tumor stage was assessed using the criteria described by Lin et al (Lin et al.,
2003). For F4/80 quantification, 3 images of hyperplastic lesions per section were captured
at 40× magnification. For phospho-histone 3 quantification, 3 images of tumor area per
section were captured at 20× magnification. Total nuclei (DAPI) and TUNEL, phosphohistone 3 and F4/80 positive cells were separately counted using Metamorph software and
the average of the 3 images calculated.
Western blotting
Whole cell mammary gland extracts and nuclear extracts were prepared and western blot
performed as previously described (Connelly et al., 2010). Primary antibodies: Cyclin D1,
p42/44 MAPK, IκB and IκBα (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), p65 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), TBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Myc-tag (SigmaAldrich) and Actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Statistical analyses

Author Manuscript

Statistical analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, CA). Densitometric analyses were performed using Odyssey V3.0 software (Licor).
All data are plotted graphically with vertical bars representing S.E. A Student's t test or
Mann-Whitney test was used to assess differences between experimental conditions.
Significance of data represented in the Kaplan-Meier curves was determined using log-rank
(Mantel-Cox) and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests for statistical significance. For statistical
analyses a probability (p) value of < 0.05 was taken as an appropriate level of significance.
