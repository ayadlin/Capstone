Abstract
This study is the first to investigate the anticancer effect of
isoobtusilactone A (IOA) in two human breast cancer cell
lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. IOA exhibited effective cell
growth inhibition by inducing cancer cells to undergo G2-M
phase arrest and apoptosis. Further investigation revealed
that IOA’s inhibition of cell growth was also evident in a nude
mice model. Cell cycle blockade was associated with increased
levels of p21 and reduced amounts of cyclin B1, cyclin A, cdc2,
and cdc25C. IOA also enhanced the levels of inactivated
phosphorylated cdc2 and cdc25C. IOA triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by a change in Bax/
Bcl-2 ratios, resulting in mitochondrial membrane potential
loss, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation. We also
found that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
is a critical mediator in IOA-induced cell growth inhibition.
Enhancement of ROS by IOA activated apoptosis signalregulating kinase 1 (ASK1) resulted in the increased activation
of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38. Antioxidants EUK8 and
N-acetyl cystenine significantly decreased apoptosis by inhibiting the ASK1 dephosphorylation at Ser967 and subsequently
increased the interaction of ASK1 with thioredoxin or 14-3-3
proteins. Moreover, blocking ASK1 by small interfering RNA
inhibition completely suppressed IOA-induced apoptosis. Taken
together, these results imply a critical role for ROS and ASK1
in IOA’s anticancer activity. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7406–20]

Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in
women and is the leading cause of death worldwide for women
between the ages of 40 and 55 (1). This pathology is currently
controlled by surgery and radiotherapy and is frequently supported
by adjuvant chemo- or hormonotherapies (1, 2). However, breast
cancer is highly resistant to chemotherapy, and there is still no
effective cure for patients with advanced stages of the disease,
especially in cases of hormone-independent cancer (2, 3). Effective
chemopreventive treatment for breast cancer would have a
tremendous impact on breast cancer morbidity and mortality.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are derived from the metabolism
of molecular oxygen. ROS include superoxide anion radical (O2 ),
singlet oxygen (1O2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the highly
reactive hydroxyl radical (OH; refs. 4, 5). ROS normally exist in

balance with biochemical antioxidants in all aerobic cells (4–7).
Oxidative stress occurs when this critical balance is disrupted
because of excess ROS, antioxidant depletion, or both. Evidence is
accumulating to indicate that chemotherapeutic agents may be
selectively toxic to tumor cells because they increase oxidant stress
and enhance these already stressed cells beyond their limit (8, 9).
Cytotoxic ROS signaling seems to be mediated in part by activation
of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (4, 10–12).
ASK1, a member of the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family,
is an upstream activator of MAPK signaling cascades (12, 13). ASK1
is activated in response to various stresses, including tumor
necrosis factor, serum withdrawal, endoplasmic reticulum stress,
Fas ligation, and H2O2 (12, 14–17). ASK1 activity is regulated at
multiple steps, including dimerization, phosphorylation, and
protein-protein interactions (17, 18). The activation of ASK1
requires dimerization and consequent autophosphorylation, events
that are modulated by several cellular stressors. Both 14-3-3 and
thioredoxin bind to ASK1 and block its activity under nonstressed
conditions (13, 19–21). H2O2 in turn triggers the dissociation of
thioredoxin from ASK1 and is thus a potent stimulus for its activity
(22, 23). Once activated, ASK1 can induce cell death by activating
several proapoptotic signaling proteins, including c-jun-NH2-kinase
(JNK) and p38 MAPK (16, 24, 25).
Cinnamomum kotoense Kanehira & Sasaki (Lauraceae) is a
small evergreen tree native to Lanyu Island of Taiwan that has
recently been cultivated as an ornamental plant. Isoobtusilactone A
(IOA; Fig. 1A) is a new butanolide constituent isolated from the
leaves of C. kotoense, and its properties as an antitumor agent have
not yet been fully described (26). This study is the first to determine
the cell growth inhibition activity of IOA and examine its effect on
cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in two human breast cancer
cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. To further establish IOA’s
anticancer mechanism, we assayed the levels of cell cycle controland apoptosis-related molecules, which are strongly associated
with the programmed cell death signal transduction pathway and
affect the chemosensitivity of tumor cells to anticancer agents.

five fractions. Fraction I was further purified by another silica gel column
using n-hexane–EtOAc to obtain IOA.
Cell culture. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the
American Type Cell Culture Collection. MCF-7 cells were cultured
in DMEM with nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
10 Ag/mL insulin, and 10% FCS. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
solution.
Cell proliferation and clonogenic assay. Cells were plated in 96-well
culture plates (1  104 cells per well). After 24 h incubation, the cells were
treated with vehicle alone (0.1% DMSO) and various concentrations of IOA
for 48 h. Inhibition of cell proliferation was measured by XTT assay as
described previously (27). To determine long-term effects, cells were treated
with IOA at various concentrations for 1 h. After being rinsed with fresh
medium, cells were allowed to form colonies for 14 days, which were then
stained with crystal violet (0.4 g/L; Sigma).
Cell cycle analysis. To determine cell cycle distribution analysis, 5  105
cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and treated with vehicle alone (0.1%
DMSO) and various concentrations of IOA for 6 h. After treatment, the cells
were stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometer as described previously
(27). The data were analyzed using Multicycle software (Phoenix Flow
Systems).
Apoptosis assay. Cells (1  106) were treated with vehicle alone
(0.1% DMSO) and various concentrations of IOA for 48 h. The cells were
then collected and centrifuged at 500  g for 5 min. DNA was extracted
from the cells as described previously (27). The DNA was separated in 2%
agarose gel and visualized by UV after staining with ethidium bromide.
Quantitative assessment of apoptotic cells was assessed by the terminal
nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) method, which
examines DNA strand breaks during apoptosis by using BD ApoAlert DNA
Fragmentation Assay kit.
Measurements of ROS and glutathione. Levels of intracellular O2 and
H2O2 were assessed spectrofluorimetrically by oxidation of specific probes:
dihydroethidium and H2DCFDA. The amount of glutathione (GSH) was
determined by CMFDA. Cells were exposed to 25 Amol/L EUK8 alone,
5 mmol/L N-acetyl cystenine (NAC), 4 Amol/L IOA alone, NAC plus IOA,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

or EUK8 plus IOA for specified time intervals. The cells were stained with
10 Amol/L H2DCFDA, 10 Amol/L dihydroethidium, and 25 Amol/L CMFDA
for 10 min at 37jC, and the fluorescence intensity of the cells was
determined using the flow cytometer (26).
Assay for caspase-9 activity. The assay is based on the ability of
the active enzyme to cleave the chromophore from the enzyme substrate of
caspase-9, LEHD-pNA (Ac-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-pNA). Cell lysates were incubated with peptide substrate in assay buffer [100 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L
HEPES, 10 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS
(pH 7.4)] for 2 h at 37jC. The release of p-nitroaniline was monitored at
405 nm. Results are represented as the percentage of change in activity
compared with the untreated control.
Mitochondrial membrane potential assay. We used mitochondrialspecific cationic dye JC-1, which undergoes potential-dependent accumulation in the mitochondria to check the change in mitochondrial membrane
potential. Following treatment with various concentrations of IOA for the
indicated times, cells were stained with 25 Amol/L JC-1 for 30 min at 37jC.
Fluorescence was monitored with the fluorescence plate reader at wavelengths of 490 nm (excitation)/540 nm (emission) and 540 nm (excitation)/
590 nm (emission) pairs. Changes in the ratio between the measurement at
test wavelengths of 590 nm (red) and 540 nm (green) fluorescence intensities
are indicative of changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (27).
Immunoprecipitation/immunoblot and JNK and p38 activity
assays. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described previously
(27). Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions were separated using
Cytochrome c Releasing Apoptosis Assay kit (BioVision). After equivalent
amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10–12%) and transferred
to polyvinylidene diflouride membranes, membranes were blocked with
5% nonfat dry milk in TBS and incubated with the desired primary
antibody for 1 to 16 h. The membrane was then treated with appropriate
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the immunoreactive
proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit
(Amersham). Quantification was made using a digital image analysis
system (SigmaGel software).
For association of ASK1 with thioredoxin or 14-3-3, cell lysates (300 Ag)
were incubated with 10 AL anti-thioredoxin or anti–14-3-3 antibodies for 1 h

at 4jC. Immunocomplexes were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Association of
thioredoxin or 14-3-3 with ASK1 was detected by incubating the blots with
anti-ASK1 antibodies. The JNK and p38 activities were determined using
kits from Cell Signaling Technology according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
siRNA-based knockdown of ASK1, JNK, and p38 expression. Breast
cancer cell monolayers were transfected with ASK1 siRNA expression
plasmid pKD-Ask1-v2, pKD-NegCon-v1, SMARTpool p38/SPAK, JNK1
siRNA duplexes or nonspecific control siRNA duplexes (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Immunoblot
analyses showed that ASK1, JNK, and p38 all remained low but detectable, and expression of h-actin was unaffected by plasmid or siRNA
transfection.
In vivo tumor xenograft study. Female nude mice [6 weeks old;
BALB/cA-nu (nu/nu)] were purchased from the National Science Council
Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan) and maintained in pathogen-free
conditions. MDA-MB-231 cells were injected s.c. into the flanks of these
nude mice (5  106 cells in 200 AL), and tumors were allowed to develop
for f30 days until they reached f200 mm3, when treatment was
initiated. Twenty mice were randomly divided into two groups. The mice
in the IOA-treated group were i.p. injected daily with IOA in a clear
solution containing 25% polyethylene glycol (PEG; 4 mg/kg of body
weight) in a volume of 0.2 mL. The control group was treated with an

IOA inhibits cell proliferation and clonogenic survival in
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. To investigate the potential cell
growth inhibition of IOA in breast cancer, we first examined the
effect of IOA on cell proliferation and clonogenic survival in MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, IOA inhibited cell
growth in both cancer cell lines in a concentration-dependent
manner. The IC50 values of IOA were 2.1 Amol/L for MCF-7 and
1.8 Amol/L for MDA-MB-231.
Additional experiments were done to determine the antitumor
activities of IOA by clonogenic assays. In vitro clonogenic assays
correlated very well with in vivo assays of tumorigenicity in
nude mice (28). Figure 1C shows the effects of IOA on the
relative clonogenicity of the control and the IOA-treated MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells. Clonogenicity of both cancer cell lines
was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure to IOA.
IOA induces cell cycle arrest and regulates the expression of
cell cycle-related proteins. To examine the mechanism responsible for IOA-mediated cell growth inhibition, cell cycle distribution
and related regulatory factors were assessed. The results showed
that treating cells with IOA caused a significant inhibition of cell
cycle progression in both cancer cell lines at 6 h (Fig. 2A), resulting
in a clear increase in the percentage of cells in the G2-M phase
when compared with the control. Figure 2B shows that IOA
treatment of the cells resulted in a time-dependent decrease in the
protein expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cdc2, and cdc25C in both
cancer cell lines (Fig. 2B). In addition, exposure of cells to IOA
resulted in an increase in levels of inactive phospho-cdc2 (Tyr15) at
3 h and phospho-cdc25C (Ser216) at 1 to 2 h. Results from timedependent studies have indicated that decreasing functional
cdc25C by increasing phosphorylation of cdc25C was followed by
an increase in phospho-cdc2 (Fig. 2B). We suggest that cdc2 action
was inhibited by a decrease in cdc25C expression. Moreover, IOA
treatment also increased the expression of CDK inhibitor p21 in
both cell lines.
IOA induces apoptosis through the activation of the
mitochondrial pathway. We next assessed the effect of IOA on
the induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 by DNA
fragmentation assay. The results showed that IOA treatment results
in the formation of DNA fragments at 48 h in both cell lines, as
determined by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2C). A quantitative
evaluation was also made using TUNEL to detect DNA strand
breaks. Compared with vehicle-treated cells, 4 Amol/L IOA at 48 h
induced 36.9% and 43.8% apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells, respectively (Fig. 2C). TUNEL-positive cells were also visible
using a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 2C).
To investigate the mitochondrial apoptotic events involved in
IOA-induced apoptosis, we analyzed the changes in the Bcl-2

family proteins, cytochrome c store, mitochondrial membrane
potential (DW m) and caspase-9 activity. Immunoblot analysis
showed that treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with
IOA increased Bax and Bak protein levels (Fig. 2B). In contrast,
IOA decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL levels, which led to an increase
in the proapoptotic/antiapoptotic Bcl-2 ratio (Fig. 2B). IOA failed
to affect the expression of Bcl-Xs. The cytosolic fraction from
untreated breast cancer cells contained no detectable amounts
of cytochrome c, whereas it did become detectable after 4 Amol/L
IOA treatment in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2B). In
addition, we investigated mitochondrial dysfunction by measuring
DW m in IOA-treated breast cancer cells for the indicated times
(Fig. 2D).
Hallmarks of the apoptotic process include the activation of
cysteine proteases, which represent both initiators and executors of
cell death (29). Upstream caspase-9 activities increased significantly, as shown by the observation that treatment with IOA increased
caspase-9 activity in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2E).
This is consistent with the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol.
Furthermore, when cells were pretreated with the specific caspase9 inhibitor LEHD-CHO before IOA treatment, the apoptosis
induction effect of IOA decreased in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 2C).
The effect of IOA on the generation of ROS and GSH and
thioredoxin levels. Dysregulation of cellular redox status can be
a potent mechanism of cell death (7). Therefore, we tested the
possibility that IOA induces apoptosis allowing for ROS accumulation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) detection
revealed that intracellular O2 and H2O2 levels increased in both
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells following treatment with 2 and
4 Amol/L IOA for 2 h (Fig. 3A). EUK8, a synthetic salen-manganese
complex with high superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalasemimic activities, completely blocked the generation of H2O2
induced by IOA. In addition, IOA-induced H2O2 was also decreased
by NAC, a ROS scavenger in cells, by interacting with OH and H2O2
(Fig. 3A).
Because GSH scavenges ROS in cells by interacting with OH and
H2O2 (30), thereby affecting ROS-mediated signaling pathways, we
next examined the levels of GSH in IOA-treated cells. Results
showed that intracellular GSH levels decreased in both MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cell lines following treatment with 4 Amol/L IOA
for 2 h treatment (Fig. 3A). Thioredoxin functions as a hydrogen
donor for many protein targets and is the major scavenger for
ROS (30), so we also assessed the changes of thioredoxin levels in
IOA-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, IOA decreased the
expression of thioredoxin in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
Decreased levels of thioredoxin are associated with reduced GSH
and increased ROS accumulation.
The effect of IOA in ASK1/MAPK signaling. Because it has
been shown that ROS-mediated DNA damage triggers activation
of MAPK and subsequent cell death (30), we assessed the status
of MAPK signaling after IOA treatment. First, ASK1 activation
(phosphorylation at the activation loop Thr845 and dephosphorylation at Ser967) was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Treatment of either MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells with IOA significantly
increased ASK1 phosphorylation (Thr845) concomitant with
reduction of inactive ASK1 phosphorylation (Ser967). The change
of active/inactive ASK1 was evident as early as 1 h after IOA
treatment (Fig. 3B). In addition, results also showed that exposure
of either line of breast cancer cells to 4 Amol/L IOA resulted in a
rapid and sustained activation of p38 and JNK. Activation

www.aacrjournals.org

(phosphorylation) of p38 and JNK was determined after 1 h
treatment and persisted for the duration of the experiment. On
the other hand, the expression of p38 and JNK (unphosphorylated
form) was not altered by IOA treatment. However, IOA only
slightly affected ERK1/2 activation in either MCF-7 or MDAMB-231 cells at any of the examined points in time (Fig. 3B).
IOA-mediated activation of p38 and JNK was additionally confirmed by determining phosphorylation of one of its substrates
[activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 and c-Jun for p38 and
JNK, respectively]. As shown in Fig. 3C, in contrast with the
control, the Ser63 phosphorylation of c-Jun increased after a 1-h
exposure of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to 4 Amol/L IOA.
Similarly, phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr71 increased in both
IOA-treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, in contrast to the
control (Fig. 3C).
We next assessed the association of endogenous thioredoxin
and 14-3-3 with ASK1 by immunoprecipitation with antithioredoxin or anti–14-3-3 antibodies followed by immunoblot
with anti-ASK1 antibodies. Figure 3D shows that the association
of thioredoxin and ASK1 decreased in a time-dependent manner
in IOA-treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Similarly, the
association of 14-3-3 protein was also reduced by IOA treatment
(Fig. 3D).
The role of ROS in IOA-mediated ASK1 activation and
apoptosis. To understand the mechanism by which ROS enhance
ASK1 activation, we next determined the role of ROS in the
dissociation of ASK1 from its inhibitors thioredoxin and 14-3-3
and the activation of ASK1. Cells were treated with the EUK8,
NAC, EUK8 plus IOA, or NAC plus IOA. Association of ASK1 with
thioredoxin or 14-3-3 was then determined by immunoprecipitation. The results showed that pretreatment with EUK8 and NAC
caused a significant inhibition of IOA-induced dissociation of
ASK1 with thioredoxin and 14-3-3 protein, as well as the phosphorylation of ASK1 at Thr845 and dephosphorylation at Ser967 in both
cell lines (Fig. 4A).
Next, we further assessed the effect of antioxidant agents in
IOA-induced apoptosis. The results showed that IOA-induced
apoptosis, in both cell lines, was significantly attenuated in EUK8
or NAC-pretreated cells, compared with IOA-treated MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells. These data strongly suggest that the generation of ROS plays an important role in IOA-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 4B).
The role of ASK1 pathway in IOA-mediated MAPK activation
and apoptosis. To confirm the central role of the ASK1 as a key
upstream of IOA-mediated JNK and p38 activation, we transfected
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 with pKD-ASK1-v2 plasmid that
constitutively expresses short hairpin RNAs targeting ASK1. As
shown in Fig. 4C, ASK1 siRNA reduced ASK1 expression f70%
in comparison with control siRNA. Selective genetic inhibition of
ASK1 abrogated the phosphorylation of JNK (Fig. 4C). Similar to
JNK activation, IOA-induced p38 activation was specifically blocked
by ASK1 inhibition, suggesting that ASK1 is a potential upstream
activator of JNK and p38 signaling (Fig. 4C).
To determine whether ASK1 is also involved in IOA-induced cell
death, ASK1 knockdown-MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were treated
with IOA (4 Amol/L), and then apoptotic rate was determined by
TUNEL. The results showed that specific knockdown ASK1
expression by ASK1 siRNA also inhibited IOA-mediated apoptosis.
These data clearly indicate that the activation of ASK1 might act as
upstream of JNK and p38 and plays a key role in IOA-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 4D).

Isoobtusilactone A–Mediated Signaling in Breast Cancer

Discussion
Breast cancer is the most common neoplasm in women of both
developed and developing countries (1). This study is the first to
find that IOA effectively inhibits tumor cell growth of two breast
cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, in vitro, concomitant
with induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibits
tumor cell growth in nude mice.
Mitochondrial apoptotic pathway has been described as an
important signaling of apoptotic cell death for mammalian cells
(29). Following the treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
with IOA, we observed that IOA treatment resulted in a significant
increase of Bax and Bak expression and a decrease of Bcl-2 and
Bcl-XL, suggesting that changes in the ratio of proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins might contribute to the
apoptosis-promotion activity of IOA. Our findings also showed a
collapse of DW m, a substantial release of cytochrome c, and the
activation of caspase-9 after breast cancer cells were treated with
IOA. These mitochondrial apoptotic events are correlated with the
modulation of IOA on Bcl-2 family proteins. The importance of
this pathway was further confirmed by the protection from
programmed cell death that is conferred by caspase-9 inhibition.
A large number of studies have established that the
enhancement of oxidative stress is associated with the apoptotic
response induced by several anticancer agents (7, 30–33). The
status of intracellular redox is regulated by antioxidant enzymes
(SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) and nonenzymatic
thiol-disulfide redox buffers (GSH, vitamin C, thioredoxin; refs.
30, 34). They have been found to play a protective role through
detoxification and modulation of the cellular redox state, and the
subsequent trigger redox-sensitive signaling pathways and interaction with pro- and antiapoptotic signals (34). High levels of GSH
and thioredoxin have been reported in a wide range of human
cancers and are associated with cancers resistant to therapy
(35, 36). Because the level of GSH and thioredoxin is an important
factor in protection against apoptosis, the efficacy of anticancer
drug-induced apoptosis requires depletions of GSH and thioredoxin, thus facilitating cancer cell death (26, 35, 36). In this study,
we have shown that treatment of either MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231
cell lines with IOA resulted in reductions of GSH and thioredoxin
followed by accumulation of O2 and H2O2. Furthermore, we
observed that the blocking enhancement of ROS by NAC and
EUK8 decreased IOA-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ROS
accumulation contributes to IOA-induced cell death in human
breast cancer cells.
A number of studies have reported that MAPK signaling
cascades play an important role in oxidative stress-induced
apoptotic cell death (13, 30). ASK1 is an upstream activator of
JNK and p38, which have been shown to be involved in the
regulation of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis (13, 25, 30).
Several cellular factors, including thioredoxin and 14-3-3, have been
reported to interact with different ASK1 domains and to inhibit
ASK1 activity (19, 22). The release of thioredoxin and 14-3-3 from
ASK1 seems to be a critical step in ASK1 activation (19, 22).
The oligomerization of free ASK1 leads to autophosphorylation of
ASK1 at Thr845 within the activation loop in the kinase domain and
subsequently recruits and activates its downstream targets MAPKK
(MKK3/6 and MKK4/7) and MAPK (JNK and p38; refs. 15, 19, 22).
Our study found that IOA-induced ROS was involved in the
decrease of inactive phosphorylation ASK1 at Ser967 and release of
ASK1 from inhibitor 14-3-3 and thioredoxin, resulting in ASK1

www.aacrjournals.org

activation. These effects, however, were canceled in MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells that were cotreated with IOA and antioxidant
agents (EUK8 and NAC). Moreover, selective knockdown ASK1
expression by siRNA-based inhibition approach also decreased the
effects of IOA on the activation of JNK, p38, and apoptosis,
suggesting that the cooperation of ROS with ASK1 plays a crucial
role in IOA-induced cell death in human breast cancer cells.
Recent studies have shown that MAPK signaling pathways
regulate the eukaryotic cell cycle. p38 has been shown as essential
for sustained G2-M arrest induced by various anticancer agents
(37–40). Reduced activity of cdc25C and a subsequent increase in
cdc2 phosphorylation led to cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase (41).
In this study, we found that the activation of p38 was involved in
the accumulation of inactive phospho-cdc2, which may be due to
the decrease of cdc25C activation by phosphorylation, leading to
subsequent G2 arrest. These effects, however, were abolished in
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines that selectively knocked down
p38 expression by p38 siRNA-based inhibition. These data suggest
that p38 plays a key role in IOA-mediated G2-M arrest. Activation of
the JNK pathways has long been associated with the apoptotic
response induced by several DNA-damaging agents (42). The
proapoptotic targets of the activated JNK are not clearly defined,
but the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun and
p53, as well as regulation of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members, have been suggested to be of importance (43). In our
study, JNK activation is involved in the events of IOA-mediated
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which is completely inhibited by
means of JNK1 siRNA-based inhibition, including Bax augmentation, Bcl-2 down-regulation, and apoptosis induction. These results
show that the p38 pathway may operate in cell cycle arrest, and
that the JNK cascade of events plays a role in apoptosis induced
by IOA.
In conclusion, the present study has shown that (a) human
breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 are highly sensitive to
growth inhibition by IOA in both in vitro and in vivo experimental
models; (b) reduced survival of either MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells after exposure to IOA is associated with G2-M phase cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis induction; (c) IOA can inhibit cell cycle
progression at the G2-M phase by increasing p21 expression and by
decreasing the expression of cdc2, cdc25C, cyclin B1, and cyclin A;
(d) IOA-induced cell growth inhibition in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells is mediated by the production of ROS, which activates
ASK1 by decreasing the interaction of ASK1 and thioredoxin or
14-3-3, and increasing phosphorylation of ASK1 at Thr845; and (e)
ASK1 activates p38 and JNK and triggers the subsequent p38dependent cell cycle arrest and JNK-mediated apoptosis. These
data provide a basic mechanism for the chemotherapeutic
properties of IOA in breast cancer cells. Future in vivo studies
using human patients may ascertain whether this cell growth
inhibition effect of IOA might contribute its overall chemotherapy
effects in the fight against breast cancer and its possible future
therapeutic applications.
