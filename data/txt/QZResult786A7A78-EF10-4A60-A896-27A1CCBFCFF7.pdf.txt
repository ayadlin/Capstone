ABSTRACT
Identification of novel molecular targets and understanding the mechanisms
underlying the aggressive nature of pancreatic cancer (PC) remain prime focus areas
of research. Here, we investigated the expression and pathobiological significance
of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), a gene that was earlier shown to be amplified in a
sub-set of PC. Our data demonstrate PAK4 overexpression in PC tissues and cell lines
with little or no expression in the normal pancreas. PAK4 silencing in two PC cell lines,
MiaPaCa and T3M4, by RNA interference causes suppression of growth and clonogenic
ability due to decreased cell cycle progression and apoptosis-resistance. PAK4-silenced
PC cells exhibit altered expression of proliferation- and survival-associated proteins.
Moreover, we observe decreased nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of
NF-κB in PAK4-silenced PC cells associated with stabilization of its inhibitory protein,
IκBα. Transfection of PAK4-silenced PC cells with constitutively-active mutant of
IKKβ, an upstream kinase of IκBα, leads to restoration of NF-κB activity and PC cell
growth. Furthermore, we show that PAK4-induced NF-κB activity is mediated through
activation and concerted action of ERK and Akt kinases. Together, these findings
suggest that PAK4 is a regulator of NF-κB pathway in PC cells and can serve as a
novel target for therapy.

INTRODUCTION

serine/threonine protein kinases family are considered as
major downstream effector molecules of Cdc42 and Rac1,
the key small Rho GTPase proteins [3-5]. Besides this,
recent evidence suggests that PAKs can also be activated
by Rho GTPase-independent signals [6, 7]. Initially, PAKs
were identified as cell morphology regulatory proteins [3],
but later their important roles in other cellular processes
including proliferation, survival, motility, etc. have also
been reported [8-10]. On the basis of their structure and
regulatory functions, PAKs have been broadly classified
into two groups: group I (PAK 1-3) and group II (PAK
4-6) [5]. Among the group II PAKs, PAK4 is the most
extensively and profoundly studied member. PAK4 has
been shown to be highly expressed in embryonic stage,
whereas its low expression is observed in majority of

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal
malignancies in the United States [1]. According to an
estimate by American Cancer Society, nearly 46,420
Americans will be diagnosed with PC in 2014 and
approximately 39,590 will die due to this devastating
disease, marking it as the fourth leading cause of cancerrelated death [1]. The overall median post-diagnosis
survival of PC patients is ~2-8 months, and 5 years
survival rate is only about 6 % underscoring its impact
on human health and wellbeing [1, 2]. Clearly, there is a
critical need to develop effective treatment strategies to
tackle this deadly malignancy.

the normal adult tissues suggesting its importance in the
embryo development [11]. An overexpression of PAK4
has also been observed in tumor tissues and cell lines
of various origins [12, 13]. Moreover, an association of
high PAK4 expression with the poor prognosis in ovarian
cancer patients has been demonstrated [14]. Besides this, a
functional association of PAK4 with tumor phenotypes has
also been established in some cancers [14-17].
PAK4 gene is localized at chromosome 19q13, a
region amplified in pancreatic tumor specimens [18].
However, till date, there is no report on its pathological
significance in PC. In the present study, we investigated
PAK4 expression and function in PC by conducting a
series of in vitro functional assays. Our data demonstrate
that PAK4 expression is associated with increased growth
of PC cells resulting from enhanced cell-cycle progression
and apoptosis-resistance. Moreover, mechanistic studies
reveal the involvement of Akt- and ERK-mediated
activation of NF-κB signaling in PAK4-induced growth
of PC cells. Together, these findings provide first
experimental evidence for a functional role of PAK4 in
PC and suggest that it could serve as a novel target for PC
therapy.

PAK4 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer
To investigate the clinical significance of PAK4
in PC pathobiology, we first examined its expression in
normal pancreas (n=9) and PC tissue specimens (n=56)
by IHC assay. Data demonstrate that ~96.4 % of the
total tumor samples have an intense staining of PAK4,
which is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm
with some diffuse staining in the nucleus. However, no
staining of PAK4 was observed in normal pancreatic
tissues (Figure 1A). In the group of PAK4-positive
tumor specimens, 25 (44.6 %) were weakly stained, 19
(33.9 %) were moderately stained and the remaining 10
(17.9 %) tumor specimens were strongly stained (Table
1). In addition, PAK4 expression was also examined in
frozen tissue samples of PC (n=21) along with normal
pancreatic tissues (n=7) by immunoblot analysis. Data
show an overexpression of PAK4 in all the PC tissues,
while no expression is observed in 5 normal tissues, while
two are weakly positive (Figure 1B). Furthermore, PAK4
expression was assessed in a panel of established PC cell
lines having varying tumorigenic and metastatic potential

was performed on paraffin embedded tissue microarray containing tissue sections (in triplicates) of normal pancreas (n=9) and pancreatic

[normal (n=7) and malignant n=21] specimens, (C) PC cell lines and (D) in vitro pancreatic cancer progression model (hTERT-HPNE and
derived cell lines). β-actin was used as internal control. Bars (mean ± SEM, n=3) indicate the normalized expression levels of PAK4.

Silencing of PAK4 decreases growth and
clonogenic potential of pancreatic cancer cells

[19]. Data demonstrate a differential expression pattern
of PAK4 in PC cell lines (Figure 1C). Next, we also
examined the expression of PAK4 in pancreatic cancer
progression (hTERT-HPNE and derived cell lines) model
to correlate the expression of PAK4 with progression
of pancreatic cancer. We observed gradually increased
expression of PAK4 in this model (Figure 1D). Together,
these findings confirm an overexpression of PAK4 in PC.

To gain insight into the pathobiological involvement
of PAK4 in PC, we silenced its expression in two high
PAK4 expressing, tumorigenic and aggressive cell lines,
MiaPaCa and T3M4, by stable transfection of PAK4-

cells. (A) Total protein from the stable pooled population of PAK4-silenced (MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4) along with their

were stained with crystal violet, visualized, photographed and counted using imaging system. (D) For anchorage independent clonogenicity

% agar growth medium and allowed to form colonies for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, colonies were visualized and counted using Nikon eclipse
microscope. Data represent as mean ± SEM. n=3, *, p< 0.05.

targeted shRNA (shPAK4) or non-targeted scrambled
sequence (NTScr) expression constructs. Stable
transfectants were selected in antibiotic-selection media
and the expression of PAK4 was analyzed by immunoblot
assay. The clones that exhibited efficient downregulation
of PAK4 were pooled for further analyses. Data show that
the pooled population of PAK4-silenced clones exhibit
significant knockdown of PAK4 in both MiaPaCa-shPAK4
and T3M4-shPAK4 cells as compared to their respective
controls (MiaPaCa-NTScr and T3M4-NTScr) (Figure
2A). We next performed in vitro assays to examine the
effects of PAK4-silencing on the growth characteristics
and clonogenic ability of PC cells. Our data from growth
kinetic assay demonstrate that the growth rate of PAK4silenced (MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4) PC cells
is significantly lower as compared to that of the respective
control (MiaPaCa-NTScr and T3M4-NTScr) cells (Figure
2B). The growth of MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4
is decreased by ~35.7 % and 31.4 %, respectively, on
8th day of culture in comparison with their respective
controls (Figure 2B). The population doubling time (dt)

calculated during exponential growth phase is increased
from 40.7 h to 59.2 h and from 42.3 h to 53.5 h upon
PAK4 silencing in MiaPaCa and T3M4 cells, respectively
(Figure 2B). Furthermore, PAK4 silenced (MiaPaCashPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4) cells show diminished
plating efficiency (3.4 and 3.2 folds, respectively)
compared to their respective control cells (Figure 2C). In
anchorage-independent colony forming assay, we observe
that the clonogenic potential of MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and
T3M4-shPAK4 cells is decreased ~3.6 and 3.3 folds in
comparison with MiaPaCa-NTScr and T3M4-NTScr cells,
respectively (Figure 2D). Taken together, our findings
suggest that PAK4 plays an important role in growth
promotion of PC cells.

PAK4 promotes cell cycle progression and
apoptosis resistance
In general, an enhanced growth of a cancer cell is a
cumulative result of increased cell cycle progression and

Figure 3: PAK4 facilitates cell cycle progression and confers apoptosis resistance. (A) For cell cycle analysis, PAK4 silenced

(MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4) cells along with their respective controls (MiaPaCa-NTScr and T3M4-NTScr) were synchronized
by culturing them in serum-free media for 72 h, and then incubated in regular medium for 24 h. Subsequently, distribution of cells in
different phases of cell cycle was analyzed by Propidium iodide (PI) staining followed by flow cytometry. (B) For apoptosis assay, PC cells
were grown in regular media for 72 h and percentage of apoptotic cells was analyzed by PE Annexin V and 7AAD staining followed by
flow cytometry.

apoptosis resistance [20]. Therefore, flow-cytometry based
assays were executed to investigate the role of PAK4 in
cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance of PC
cells. Our cell cycle analysis data indicate that the PAK4
silencing causes a G1 phase cell cycle arrest in PC cells,
which is clearly evident by the more number of MiaPaCashPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4 cells in G1-phase (77.3 %
and 82.3 %, respectively) as compared to MiaPaCa-NTScr
(43.4 %) and T3M4-NTScr (57.6 %) cells (Figure 3A).

Moreover, apoptosis assay results show that the PAK4silenced (MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4) cells
are more apoptotic (~2.4 and 2.3 folds, respectively) as
compared to their controls (Figure 3B). After confirming
the role of PAK4 in cell cycle progression and apoptotic
resistance, we next examined the expression profile of
proteins associated with cell proliferation and survival
by immunoblot assay in PAK4- silenced and control
cells to decipher the mechanistic basis of these effects.
We observed that MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4
cells have decreased expression of cyclins (A1, D1 and
E1) and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl2 and Bcl-xL) as
compared to MiaPaCa-NTScr and T3M4-NTScr cells,
respectively. In contrast, high expression of p27 and p21
(Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors) and pro-apoptotic
protein Bax in PAK4 silenced (MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and
T3M4-shPAK4) cells is observed (Figure 4). Together,
these findings indicate that the PAK4 enhances growth of
PC cells by inducing cell cycle progression and apoptosis
resistance.

NF-κB is involved in PAK4-induced proliferation
and survival of pancreatic cancer cells
NF-κB is constitutively active in many cancers,
including PC and it has been shown that NF-κB plays
a significant role in facilitating cell proliferation and
apoptosis resistance [21, 22]. Therefore, we next
studied the involvement of NF-κB in PAK4-mediated
pathobiological functions. The effect of PAK4 silencing
on transcriptional activity of NF-κB was analyzed by
luciferase-based promoter reporter assay. As shown
in Figure 5A, the transcriptional activity of NF-κB

proteins associated with cell-cycle and apoptosis. Total
protein from PAK4-silenced (MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and T3M4shPAK4) cells along with their scrambled control (MiaPaCaNTScr and T3M4-NTScr) was isolated and expression of various
cell cycle and survival-associated proteins was examined by
immunoblot analysis. β-actin was used as an internal control.

responsive promoter was decreased by ~3.4 fold in
MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and ~2.8 fold in T3M4-shPAK4 as
compared to that in control cells. These findings were
further confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Our data
show a decreased nuclear accumulation of NF-κB/p65
that correlates with its increased cytoplasmic levels in
PAK4-silenced (MiaPaCa-shPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4)
cells as compared to their respective control (MiaPaCaNTScr and T3M4-NTScr) cells (Figure 5B, upper panel).
We also studied the effects of PAK4-silencing on IκBα,
which inhibits NF-κB by keeping it sequestered into the
cytoplasm [22]. Data demonstrate a significant decrease in
the level of phospho-IκBα, while simultaneously increase
in the level of total IκBα in PAK4-silenced (MiaPaCashPAK4 and T3M4-shPAK4) cells in comparison to
PAK4 expressing (MiaPaCa-NTScr and T3M4-NTScr)
cells (Figure 5B, lower panel). To confirm the role of NFκB in PAK4-induced growth, PAK4-silenced cells were
transfected with constitutively active mutant of IKKβ
(IKKβ-SSEE) or control vector (pCMV). Thereafter, its
effect on transcriptional activity of NF-κB, cell growth,
and the proteins associated with cell proliferation and
apoptosis was examined. Our data show that upon IKKβ
mutant transfection, transcriptional activity and nuclear
accumulation of NF-κB/p65 in PAK4-silenced cells was
restored (Figure 6A & B), which correlated with regained
cell growth (Figure 6C). Furthermore, transfection of
constitutively active IKKβ mutant also restored the
expression of cell cycle promoting and anti-apoptotic
proteins in PAK4-silenced cells (Figure 6D). Together,
these findings suggest that PAK4 enhances pancreatic
cell growth by promoting nuclear accumulation and
transcriptional activity of NF-κB.

the transcriptional activity of NF-κB upon inhibition of
Akt as well as ERK in both the PC cells, whereas their
combined inhibition caused a more potent suppression
(Figure 7B). A similar effect of the Akt and/or ERK
inhibition on nuclear accumulation of NF-κB/p65 was
observed in PC cells (Figure 7C, upper panel). Having
observed association of cellular IκBα level with the PAK4induced nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity
of NF-κB, we also examined the effects of Akt and/or
ERK inhibition of the IκBα in PC cells by immunoblot
assay. Our data show that inhibition of either Akt or ERK
increases the expression level of IκBα in both the PC
cells, which is associated with a concomitant decrease
in its phosphorylation status (Figure 7C, lower panel).
Therefore, these findings suggest a role of PAK4-mediated
activation of Akt/ERK pathways in enhanced nuclear
accumulation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB.

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrated, for the first time,
a pathobiological role of PAK4 in proliferation and
survival of PC cells. Moreover, the data revealed the
participation of Akt- and ERK-mediated activation of
NF-κB in PAK4-induced growth of PC cells. PAK4 has
earlier been shown to be amplified in a sub-set of PC
tissue [18]. Similarly, we also observed an overexpression
of PAK4 in PC tissues and established cell lines, while it
was not expressed or expressed at low levels in normal
pancreatic tissues. It is; however, yet to be established
whether PAK4 overexpression could solely be ascribed
to gene amplification or it might also involve other gene
regulatory mechanisms.
Besides PC, PAK4 overexpression has also
been reported for several other tumor types including
ovarian, breast, gastric and colon tumors suggesting
its important roles in tumor development [5, 12, 14].
Indeed, our in vitro studies provide clear evidence for a
growth promoting role of PAK4 in PC. Similar findings
have also been reported in earlier published studies [14,
16, 17]. It has been shown that PAK4-overexpression
is associated with the tumorigenic potential of human
breast cancer cells in athymic mice [10]. Similarly, it
was reported that PAK4 promoted gastric tumorigenesis
[26]. In another important observation, an essential role of
PAK4 in K-Ras driven proliferation and colony formation
ability of colon cancer cells was also established [27].
Considering the fact that K-Ras is mutated in ~95 % cases
of pancreatic tumors, PAK4 might also be involved in
mediating and/or regulating constitutive K-Ras activationdriven downstream signaling pathways involved in cell
proliferation, survival and therapy resistance [28, 29].
The uncontrolled and rapid growth of cancer cells is
primarily attributed to the enhanced cell-cycle progression
and development of apoptotic resistance [20]. Similar to
the other cellular event, cell-cycle and apoptosis processes

PAK4-enhances nuclear accumulation and
transcriptional activity of NF-κB through
activation of Akt and ERK pathways
After confirming the role of NF-κB in PAK4mediated PC cell growth, we next sought out to delineate
the molecular mechanism underlying PAK4-induced
NF-κB activation. For this, we primarily focused on two
known downstream mediators of PAK4, Akt and ERK,
which are also shown to regulate NF-κB in cancer cells
[23-25]. Our immunoblot data demonstrate significantly
decreased expression of phospho-Akt as well as
phospho-ERK in PAK4 knockdown PC cells, while no
noticeable effect is observed on the expression of total
Akt and ERK (Figure 7A). To confirm the participation
of Akt and ERK in PAK4-induced activation of NF-κB,
MiaPaCa-NTScr and T3M4-NTScr cells were treated with
pharmacological inhibitors of Akt (LY294002) and ERK
(PD98059), alone or in combination, and their effects on
the nuclear accumulation/transcriptional activity of NFκB was examined. The data show a partial reduction in

are tightly regulated by specific proteins such as cyclins
and their inhibitors (in case of cell-cycle) and anti/
pro-apoptotic proteins (for survival) [30, 31]. Our data
revealed that suppressed growth in PAK4-knockdown
PC cells resulted from decreased cell-cycle progression
and induction of apoptosis. Moreover, we also observed
that PAK4 silencing led to altered expression of several
proteins associated with cell-cycle (Cyclin D1, A, p21
and p27) and apoptosis (Bax, Bcl2 and Bcl-xL). Similar
to our findings, importance of PAK4 in the regulation
of cell-cycle and development of apoptosis resistance
has also been reported by other groups as well [32].
Nekrasova and Minden in 2011 reported the arrest of
PAK4-deleted fibroblast cells in G1 phase of cell-cycle,
which was associated with increased p21 and decreased
Cyclin D1 expression in these cells [15]. Furthermore, it
was also demonstrated that PAK4 prevented cancer cells
from undergoing apoptotic cell death by inhibiting the
activation of caspases-3/8/7 and subsequently leading to
PARP1 cleavage [33].
Role of NF-κB, a transcription factor, in the

pathobiology of several cancers has been very well
documented [21, 22]. NF-κB induces the expression
of a number of oncogenes involved in the regulation of
multiple cellular process including cell proliferation and
survival [34, 35]. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests
that NF-κB is constitutively active in PC [36, 37];
however, the exact molecular mechanism(s) responsible
for the activation of NF-κB in PC is not well understood.
In this context, we investigated the role of PAK4 in the
activation of NF-κB/p65 in PC cells and its involvement
in PAK4-mediated effects. We observed decreased
transcription activity/nuclear accumulation of NF-κB/
p65 in PAK4 knockdown cells, which was associated
with inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation and concomitant
increase in its expression. Usually, IκB-α binds with NKκB/p65 and keeps it sequestered in the cytoplasm of a cell.
Upon phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as IKK,
IκB-α gets degraded that causes release and subsequent
nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65, which then induces
gene expression [22, 34]. Similar to current study, we
have also witnessed IκB-α-mediated negative regulation

as loading control. (B) PAK4 expressing (MiaPaCa-NTScr and T3M4-NTScr) cells were treated with Akt inhibitor (LY294002, 20 μm) or

activity was examined after 48 h as described previously. Bars represent the mean of triplicates ± SEM, *, p< 0.05. (C) Total and nuclear

of NF-κB/p65 in prostate cancer cells [38]. Our additional
data using constitutive active mutant of IKK, an upstream
negative regulator of IκB-α provided evidence to support
an important role of NF-κB in PAK4-induced growth of
PC cells through regulation of proliferation- and survivalassociated genes. These findings corroborate other findings
where NF-κB has been shown to regulate cell-cycle and
apoptosis in other cancer types [34, 39].
Based on the studies conducted so far, it has been
suggested that PAK4 can activate several signaling
pathways responsible for tumorigenesis [4, 5, 13, 26,
27]. Here, we observed that the phosphorylation status
of Akt and ERK in PC cells was directly associated with
PAK4 expression. Moreover, our data demonstrated that
both Akt and ERK played an important role in mediating
the effect of PAK4 on subcellular localization of NFκB/p65 and its transcriptional activity. This is consistent
with our recent finding, where we have delineated the
cooperative involvement of Akt and ERK pathways in
the activation of NF-κB/p65 [40]. In another report, ERK
has been identified as a downstream effector pathway
mediating PAK4-induced pro-survival effects [41]. In
addition, a recent study suggested the role of PI3/Akt and
ERK pathways in the PAK4-induced cisplatin resistance
in gastric cancer cells [23]. Interestingly, a positive
reciprocal association between PAK4 and PI3K/Akt, in
which both of the molecules activates each other, has
also been demonstrated [23]. However, exact molecular
mechanism(s) involved in the PAK4-mediated regulation
of Akt and ERK pathways are yet to be characterized. It
is likely that PAK4 may indirectly impact ERK and Akt
phosphorylation through regulation of c-Src and EGFR,
which are their known upstream activators [14].
In summary, our findings have provided first
experimental evidence to support that PAK4 is
overexpressed in PC and promotes proliferation and
survival of PC cells via activation of oncogenic signaling
pathways. These data suggest that PAK4 could serve as a
novel diagnostic biomarker and/or is a promising target for
therapeutic intervention in pancreatic cancer.

For the generation of stable PAK4 knockdown cell
lines, PAK4 overexpressing PC (MiaPaCa and T3M4) cells
were transfected with PAK4-shRNA-pGFP-V-RS along
with control plasmid (NTScr-shRNA-pGFP-V-RS) using
X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
The cells expressing PAK4 shRNA (MiaPaCa-shPAK4
and T3M4-shPAK4) or non-target scrambled control
(MiaPaCa-NTScr and T3M4-NTScr) were selected in
media containing Puromycin (2 μg/ml) and were assessed
for PAK4 expression by immunoblotting. The clones
showing significant knockdown of PAK4 were pooled and
expanded for further experiments. For dissecting the role
of NF-κB/p65, PAK4 knockdown cells were transiently
transfected with constitutively active IKKβ mutant
(pCMV-IKKβ S177E S181E) along with its control vector
(pCMV) using X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, tissue specimens and human tissue
microarray
The human PC cell lines were maintained as
monolayer cultures in RPMI-1640 or Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), penicillin (100
units/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) (Invitrogen)
in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37 °C. All
the cell lines were tested intermittently and determined

Cell cycle analysis

Reagent. To elucidate the role of Akt and ERK, cells were
treated with 20 µM LY294002 (Akt inhibitor) and 25 µM
PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) (Cell Signaling Technology)
alone or in combination as described in respective figure
legend.

Cells (1x106 cells/well) were synchronized by
culturing them in serum-free media for 72 h. Subsequently,
cells were grown in regular medium for 24 h, washed,
trypsinized and fixed with 70 % ethanol overnight at 4 °C.
Post fixation cells were washed, stained with Propidium
Iodide using PI/RNase kit (BD Bio Sciences, San Jose,
CA) and analyzed by flow-cytometry on a BD-FACS
Canto™ II (BD Bio Sciences). The percentage of cell
population in various phases of cell cycle was calculated
using Mod Fit LT software (Verity Software House,
Topsham, ME).

Immunoblot analysis
Total protein from the PC cells and frozen tissue
samples was isolated and estimated using DC Protein
Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Thereafter, protein
samples (80-120 µg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
subjected to immunoblot analysis as described earlier [25,
42] using specific antibodies against various proteins.
β-actin, α-tubulin and Laminin were used as loading
controls for total, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins,
respectively. All the primary antibodies were used at
1:1000 dilution except antibodies against p27, Cyclin
A1, Akt and p-Akt (1:500), whereas all the secondary
antibodies were used at 1:2000 dilution. β-actin was used
at 1:20,000 dilution. The signal was detected using ECL
plus Western Blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific, Logan,
UT) and LAS-3000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.,
Tokyo, Japan).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis assay was performed using PE Annexin
V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells
(1x105 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plate and allowed
to grow for 72 h. Thereafter, the harvested cells were
washed, suspended in 1 mL DNA binding buffer, incubated
with PE Annexin V and 7AAD (7-Amino-Actinomycin-d)
in the dark for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry.

Growth kinetics assay

Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation

MiaPaCa and T3M4 cells (1x104/well) were seeded
in 6-well plates and allowed to grow for 8 days. The
growth rate was determined by counting the number of
viable cells by dye exclusion method using Countess®
Automated Cell Counter (Life technology™, Carlsbad,
CA), every day for eight days. Cell population doubling
time (dt) was calculated during exponential growth phase
(96-144 h) using the following formula: dt = 0.693 t/
ln (Nt/N0), where t is time (in h), Nt is the cell number
at time t, and N0 is the cell number at initial time. The
percent growth inhibition on 8th day was calculated using
the formula: 100-[(NshPAK4/NNTScr) X 100], where NshPAK4
and NNTScr are the number of cells on 8th day.

The cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared
using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad,
CA) In brief, cells were washed following treatment with
1 mL ice-cold PBS/phosphatase inhibitors, lysed in 500
µL hypotonic buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 30 s at
4 °C. After collecting supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction),
pellets were re-suspended in 50 µL complete lysis buffer,
incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14,000
g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (nuclear fraction)
were stored at -80 °C.

NF-κB transcriptional activity assay

Clonogenicity assay

PC cells were grown in 6-well plate and transiently
transfected with 1 µg of NF-κB-luciferase-based promoterreporter construct i.e. pGL4.32 [luc2P/NF-κB -RE/
Hygro] and 0.5 µg of control reporter plasmid (pRL-TK)
containing Renillareniformis luciferase gene downstream
of the TK promoter. After 48 h of transfection, the cells
were harvested in passive lysis buffer and luciferase
activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay
System (Promega).

For anchorage-independent clonogenicity assay,
cells (2.5x103) suspended in 0.4 % agar in regular
medium were plated in 6-well plate on the top of 0.8 %
agar layer and allowed to form colonies under normal
culture conditions for 3 weeks. For anchorage-dependent
clonogenicity assay, cells (1x103) were seeded in 6-well
plate and allowed to grow for 2 weeks under normal
culture conditions. After respective incubation period
colonies were fixed, stained, counted and photographed
(100X) using Nikon Eclipse microscope (Nikon
Instruments Inc. Melville, NY) and counted.

and in the formation of filopodia. EMBO J. 1998;17:652740.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was
performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
pancreatic tissue microarray slide containing tissue from
normal pancreas and tumor samples from PC patients.
In brief, tissue specimens were deparaffinized using
EZ-Dewax (Biogenex, Fremont, CA), rehydrated and
incubated in Peroxidazed I (Biocare Medical, Concord,
CA) for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
Thereafter, antigen retrieval was achieved by using
decloaking Chamber (Biocare Medical) according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, tissue sections
were blocked for 10 min with Background Sniper
(Biocare Medical) and incubated with PAK4 specific
antibody (1:2500, rabbit polyclonal) for 60 min at
room temperature. After that, sections were incubated
at room temperature with recommended polymer and
probe (Biocare Medical) according to manufacturer’s
protocol. Immunoreactivity was visualized by using
DAB Chromogen followed by hematoxylin counterstain.
Thereafter, microarray slide was examined and scored
by a pathologist on a four point scale [staining intensity:
(0 to 3+) and percentage of positive cells: (0 to 4)] and
composite score was calculated by multiplying intensity
score by extent score.
