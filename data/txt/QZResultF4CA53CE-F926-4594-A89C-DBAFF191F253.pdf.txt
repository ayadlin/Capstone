Abstract
Cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) is an attractive target for antibody-based cancer
immunotherapy because of its role in tumor cell biology, its high expression on malignant cells including cancerinitiating cells, and its restricted distribution in normal tissues. The clinical use of CSPG4 has been hampered
by the lack of a CSPG4-speciﬁc chimeric, humanized, or fully human monoclonal antibody. To overcome this
limitation, we generated a CSPG4-speciﬁc fully human single-chain antibody termed scFv-FcC21 and characterized its speciﬁcity and antitumor activity. Viable CSPG4þ melanoma cells were used in a screen of a human
scFv phage display library that included CDR3 engineered to optimize antibody binding sites. The scFv antibody
isolated was then recombinantly engineered with a human immunoglobulin G1 Fc region to construct the fully
human antibody scFv-FcC21, which recognized tumors of neuroectodermal origin, various types of carcinomas,
mesotheliomas, and sarcomas as well as myeloid leukemias. scFv-FcC21 inhibited in vitro growth and migration of
tumor cells and in vivo growth of human tumor xenografts. These effects were mediated by inhibition of the
activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase and focal adhesion kinase signaling pathways that are critical
for tumor cell growth and migration, respectively. Our ﬁndings deﬁne the CSPG4-speciﬁc fully human scFv-FcC21
antibody as a candidate therapeutic agent to target the many types of tumors that express CSPG4. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The beneﬁcial effects of tumor antigen–speciﬁc monoclonal
antibody (mAb)-based immunotherapy on the clinical course
of some hematologic and solid malignancies (1) have reinforced our interest in continuing our studies to optimize an
mAb that targets the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4
(CSPG4). This cell surface tumor antigen, also known as
high-molecular-weight melanoma–associated antigen, is
involved in the activation of several signaling pathways that

play an important role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, and
migration as well as in tumor progression (2–4).
CSPG4 is expressed on melanoma cells and on various types
of carcinoma and sarcoma cells as well as on myeloid leukemic
cells (5). Because of its high expression on tumor cells, including
cancer-initiating cells; its restricted distribution in normal
tissues; and its role in tumor cell biology, CSPG4 has been used
as a target of antibody-based immunotherapy in patients with
melanoma (6, 7). Induction of CSPG4-speciﬁc antibodies was
associated with regression of metastases in a few patients (8)
and statistically signiﬁcant survival prolongation (6, 7, 9). This
association is likely to reﬂect a cause–effect relationship
between induction of CSPG4-speciﬁc antibodies and apparent
clinical beneﬁt, as administration of a CSPG4-speciﬁc mAb to
immunodeﬁcient mice grafted with CSPG4þ human cell lines
inhibited their growth, recurrence of disease, and/or metastasis
(4, 10, 11). The latter ﬁndings have prompted us to develop
an immunotherapeutic strategy with a CSPG4-speciﬁc mAb
for the treatment of tumors that express this antigen. However,
the clinical application of CSPG4-speciﬁc mAb-based immunotherapy is hampered by the lack of a chimeric, humanized, or
fully human CSPG4-speciﬁc mAb. To overcome this limitation,
we have generated a CSPG4-speciﬁc fully human single chain
of variable regions of heavy and light chain (scFv)-Fc antibody, which eliminates the mouse sequence-speciﬁc immune
responses that patients may develop when injected with

CSPG4-Speciﬁc Fully Human scFv-FcC21 Antibody

antibodies engineered from mouse mAb (12, 13). The scFv-Fc
format with an approximate molecular weight of 100 kDa was
preferred to a whole immunoglobulin G (IgG) with an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa. The latter is expected to have
a lower tumor-targeting/penetrating ability than the former,
given the inverse relationship between an antibody's size and its
tumor penetration (14). In this article, we describe the isolation
of the CSPG4-speciﬁc human scFv C21 and the construction of
the fully human scFv-FcC21 antibody. Furthermore, we characterize the speciﬁcity of this antibody and the mechanisms
underlying its antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.

Cell lines were monitored at least every 3 months for
expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II
antigens, of tumor antigens, and of adhesion molecules, and for
sensitivity to zeocin. Lesions of melanocytic origin were
obtained from patients who had undergone surgery in the
Department of Dermatology at Kumamoto University School
of Medicine (Kumamoto, Japan). The diagnosis of melanoma
lesions was based on histopathologic characteristics. Frozen
and formalin-ﬁxed melanoma tissue sections were prepared as
described previously (16). Normal tissue microarray
(Cat#FBN401) was purchased from US Biomax, Inc.

Materials and Methods

Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, scFv antibodies,
and reagents
The CSPG4-speciﬁc mAb 149.53, 225.28, 763.74, TP61.5, VF1TP34, and VF1-TP41.2 (5); the B7-H3–speciﬁc mAb 376.96 (17);
the HLA class I antigen-speciﬁc mAb TP25.99 (18); the c-myc
(all our scFv except scFv-Fc are c-myc–tagged) oncoproteinspeciﬁc mAb 9E10 (19); the anti-idiotypic (anti-id) mAb MK223 (20); and the calnexin-speciﬁc mAb TO-5 (21) were derived
from immunized mice as described. The CSPG4-speciﬁc
human scFv #28 (22), #61 (16), and #70 (22), and the anti–
anti-idiotypic (anti–anti-id) scFv119 (23), which recognizes the
anti-id mAb MK2-23, were isolated from the synthetic scFv
library (#1; ref. 24) by panning with melanoma cells S5, puriﬁed
CSPG4, melanoma cells SK-MEL-28, and anti-id mAb MK2-23,
respectively. The human scFv F98 and W34, which recognize
unrelated tumor cell surface antigens (unpublished data) were
isolated from the semisynthetic scFv library (25) by panning
with the melanoma cells FO-1 and WM1158, respectively.
Mouse mAbs were puriﬁed from ascitic ﬂuid as described
(26). The purity and activity of mAb, scFv, and scFv-Fc preparations were assessed by SDS-PAGE and by testing with each

Isolation of scFv C21 by panning the semisynthetic phage
display scFv antibody library with CSPG4þ cells Colo38
Forty clones, which were isolated from the semisynthetic
phage display scFv antibody library by panning 3 times with
Colo38 cells, were screened in ELISA with CSPG4þ cells Colo38,
and with CSPG4 B lymphoid cells LG2. The CSPG4-reactive
clone scFv C21 was selected for additional studies because
of its selective strong reactivity with Colo38 cells. Because
scFv C21 tends to aggregate at a concentration of more than
1 mg/mL, we generated scFv-FcC21. The scFv C21 and scFvFcC21 displayed superimposable reactivity patterns with
cells; therefore, they have been used interchangeably in the
experiments to be described.
Analysis of the speciﬁcity of scFv C21/scFv-FcC21
When tested in ELISA with a panel of human cell lines with
differential CSPG4 expression, and with the rat neural cell line
B49, which expresses the CSPG4 homolog NG2 (30), scFv C21
reacted only with the melanoma cell lines Colo38, FO-1, SKMEL-28, and Melur. All of them are the only ones in the panel of
the cell lines tested to express CSPG4, suggesting that scFv C21
is speciﬁc for CSPG4 (Supplementary Fig. S1). This possibility
was proven by 4 lines of evidence. First, the reactivity of scFvFcC21 with MV3 melanoma cells was reduced by at least 70%

immunodepleted with mAb 763.74. The immunodepleted cell extract was immunoprecipitated with insolubilized mAb 763.74 and scFv C21. Antigens
were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were ﬁxed, dried, and autoradiographed for up to 1 day at 80 C. A

when CSPG4 expression was knocked down by transduction
with CSPG4-speciﬁc shRNA lentivirus (Fig. 1A). Second, scFv
C21 stained M14 cells, which had acquired CSPG4 expression
following stable transfection with the full-length CSPG4 cDNA,
but did not stain the parental M14 cells (Fig. 1B). Third, scFv
C21 immunoprecipitated 2 moieties with an electrophoretic
proﬁle similar to that of CSPG4 components immunoprecipitated by CSPG4-speciﬁc mouse mAb from 125I-labeled Colo38
cells. Finally, in sequential immunoprecipitation experiments
scFv C21 did not immunoprecipitate any components from a
Colo38 cell lysate, which had been immunodepleted with the
CSPG4-speciﬁc mouse mAb 763.74 (5). The immunodepletion
is speciﬁc, as scFv C21 immunoprecipitated the CSPG4 components from a Colo38 cell lysate immunodepleted with the
B7-H3-speciﬁc mAb 376.96 (ref. 17; Fig. 1C).
Binding kinetics and internalization of scFv-FcC21 to
CSPG4þ living cells
To obtain a physiologically relevant measurement of the
binding kinetics of scFv-FcC21 to CSPG4, we used CSPG4þ
living cells MV3 as the source of the antigen and ﬂow cytometry. scFv-Fc119 was used as an isotype control. The dissociation constant of scFv-FcC21, kd (50 nmol/L) ¼ koff (1.0 
103S1)/kon (0.2  105M1S1), falls into a favorable range of
an antibody for tumor percolation (ref. 31; Fig. 1D). Moreover,
Cy3-labeled scFv-FcC21 was internalized following a 45-minute incubation with MV3 cells (Fig. 2).
Characterization of the scFv C21/scFv-FcC21 deﬁned
epitope
Carbohydrates appear to play a major role in the expression
of the epitope deﬁned by scFv C21 because of the marked
reduction in the intensity of the CSPG4 components immunoprecipitated from Colo38 cells intrinsically labeled with
35
S-methionine in the presence of the N-glycosylation inhibitor
tunicamycin. The inhibition of N-glycosylation is indicated by
the accumulation of the 220-kDa precursor recognized only by
mAb 763.74 which deﬁnes a CSPG4 peptide epitope (Fig. 3A). In
addition, the reactivity of scFv-FcC21 with MV3 cells was lost
following incubation with deglycosylation enzymes (Fig. 3B).
Competition experiments showed that the epitopes recognized by scFv C21 and by mouse mAb VF1-TP34 are distinct,
but spatially close, as they partially inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the binding of each other to CSPG4þ SK-MEL-28
cells (Fig. 3C and D). In contrast, the scFv C21-deﬁned epitope
is distinct and spatially distant from those recognized by
the mouse mAb 149.53, 225.28, 763.74, TP61.5, and VF1-TP41.2
and by the human scFv #28, #61, and #70, as the latter antibodies did not inhibit the binding of scFv C21 to SK-MEL-28
cells (data not shown).
Staining of lesions of melanocytic origin by scFv
C21/scFv-FcC21
scFv C21 stained frozen melanocytic lesions in the immunoperoxidase reaction, but did not stain formalin-ﬁxed and
parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) melanocytic lesions. The staining
was both membranous and cytoplasmic (Fig. 4A–F). scFv C21
and CSPG4-speciﬁc mouse mAb 763.74 stained homogeneously

7414

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

(>80% of cells were positively stained) 4 pigmented nevi with a
membranous and a cytoplasmic pattern. Furthermore, mAb
763.74 stained 14 of 15 primary lesions with a homogeneous
pattern, whereas scFv C21 stained 9 with a homogenous pattern
and 2 with a heterogeneous (<80% of cells were positively
stained) pattern. The staining was membranous in 1 lesion,
membranous and cytoplasmic in 4, and cytoplasmic in 6.
Finally, of the 6 metastatic lesions stained by mAb 763.74 with
a homogeneous pattern, 3 were stained by scFv C21 with a
homogeneous pattern and 3 with a heterogeneous pattern. The
staining was membranous and cytoplasmic in 3 lesions and
cytoplasmic in the remaining 3. The staining is speciﬁc as scFv
C21 stained CSPG4þ M14/CSPG4 cell pellet–derived frozen
sections, which served as a positive control, but did not stain
CSPG4 M14 cell pellet–derived frozen sections, which served
as a negative control. In contrast, no staining of normal tissues
was detected when a tissue microarray composed of 20 normal
human tissues was stained with scFv-FcC21 (Supplementary
Table S1).
Reactivity of scFv-FcC21 with a panel of CSPG4þ
malignant cell lines
Flow cytometric analysis showed that scFv-FcC21
stained a panel of human malignant cell lines, all of which
express CSPG4. Representative examples include the melanoma cell lines Colo38, MV3, and M21; the glioma cell line
LN443; the SCCHN cell line PCI30; the breast carcinoma cell
line MDA-MB-231; the mesothelioma cell line PPM-Mill; the
primary chondrosarcoma cell line KC; the osteosarcoma
cell line MG-63; and the myeloid leukemia cell line ML-2
(Fig. 5). The staining is speciﬁc for CSPG4 for the following
reasons: (i) the reactivity pattern of scFv-FcC21 with the
panel of cell lines is superimposable to that of the CSPG4speciﬁc mouse mAb 225.28 (data not shown); (ii) scFvFcC21 did not stain M14 cells which do not express CSPG4;
and (iii) the isotype control scFv-Fc119 did not stain any of
the cell lines tested.
Functional in vitro properties of scFv-FcC21
Comparison of the functional properties of scFv-FcC21 and
of scFv C21 showed that the latter is markedly less active than
the former one (data not shown). Therefore, only scFv-FcC21
was used in functional assays. scFv-FcC21 mediated neither
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity nor complement-dependent cytotoxicity of target cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2). In contrast, scFv-FcC21 inhibited the growth in vitro of
CSPG4þ MDA-MB-231, and MV3 cells by 13% and 17%, respectively, when they were cultured in 3-dimensional Matrigel
matrices (Fig. 6A and B). Furthermore, scFv-FcC21 inhibited
the migration of MDA-MB-231 and MV3 cells toward ﬁbronectin in a Boyden chamber assay by 28% and 50%, respectively. The inhibitory effects of scFv-FcC21 are likely to reﬂect
its ability to interfere with the CSPG4 role in ERK and FAK
signaling pathways, which are associated with tumor cell
growth and motility. Incubation with scFv-FcC21 for up to
72 hours inhibited, in a time-dependent manner, the activation
of p-ERK1/2 by 37% and 63% and of FAK by 40% and 67% in
MDA-MB-231 and MV3 cells, respectively (Fig. 6C and D).

Inhibition by scFv-FcC21 of established human
melanoma cell–derived lung metastases in vivo
scFv-FcC21 inhibited the growth of established experimental lung metastases in SCID mice that had been injected
i.v. with the human melanoma cell lines MV3 or M21. The
lungs harvested from the mice injected i.v. 3 times with scFvFcC21 were smaller and had a much smoother surface than
those harvested from the mice treated with an isotype control
(Fig. 7A). Furthermore, quantitative histologic examination
revealed that scFv-FcC21 had caused an 87% and a 95%
reduction in the size of established lung metastatic nodules

Discussion
The speciﬁc reactivity with CSPG4þ cells, the marked
reduction of reactivity with cells caused by shRNA knockdown of CSPG4 expression, and the molecular proﬁle of the
moieties immunoprecipitated from CSPG4þ cells indicates
the CSPG4 speciﬁcity of scFv C21. This scFv was isolated
from a semisynthetic phage display scFv antibody library by
panning with the cultured CSPG4þ human melanoma cells
Colo38. CSPG4 is an attractive target to implement antibody-based immunotherapy of malignant diseases for several reasons. First, CSPG4 is highly expressed on malignant
cells, but has a restricted distribution in normal tissues (32).
This distribution accounts for the selective targeting of
malignant lesions when radiolabeled CSPG4-speciﬁc mAbs

7416

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

have been injected in patients with CSPG4þ melanoma
lesions (33, 34). Furthermore, these results altogether provide an explanation for the lack of side effects in patients
with melanoma who developed CSPG4-speciﬁc antibodies
following immunization with CSPG4 mimics, in spite of an
apparent antitumor effect (7, 8). Second, CSPG4 has a higher
expression on activated pericytes in the tumor microenvironment than on resting pericytes in other anatomic sites
(4, 11). This differential distribution of CSPG4 accounts for
the lack of association of the antiangiogenic effects mediated by immunotargeting of CSPG4 in the tumor microenvironment with side effects associated with blood vessel
damage such as delay in wound healing (35). Third, the
distribution of CSPG4 on tumors of different embryologic
origin is broader than what we originally reported (5).
Therefore, immunotherapeutic strategies targeting CSPG4
may be applicable to a variety of malignant diseases. Fourth,
at least in HNSCC and in triple-negative breast carcinoma,

CSPG4 is expressed on cancer-initiating cells (4, 11). As a
result, CSPG4 can mediate immunotargeting of these cells,
which, according to the cancer stem cell theory (36, 37), have
to be eradicated in order for immunotherapy to be effective.
Finally, scFv-FcC21 is able to internalize into tumor cells,
thereby providing its potential, when conjugated with a
cytotoxic agent, as a CSPG4þ tumor-selective antibody–drug
conjugate.
Carbohydrates play a role in the expression of the scFv
C21 deﬁned epitope, as scFv C21 immunoprecipitated a
markedly reduced level of CSPG4 from melanoma cells
which synthesize the antigen in the presence of tunicamycin,
an inhibitor of N-glycosylation of glycoproteins (38). This
conclusion was corroborated by the lack of reactivity of
scFv-FcC21 with CSPG4þ MV3 cells treated with a pool of
endoglycosidases. Regardless of its chemical nature, the scFv
C21 deﬁned epitope, like those recognized by CSPG4-speciﬁc
mouse mAb (5, 39), is expressed not only on cell lines but
also in surgically removed lesions of melanocytic origin and
has a heterogeneous distribution at the cellular and at the
molecular level.
scFv C21 shares some characteristics with the CSPG4speciﬁc human scFv antibodies we have previously described
(16, 22). Like scFv#70 (22), scFv C21 immunoprecipitates both
subunits of CSPG4 from melanoma cells. This ﬁnding may
reﬂect the expression of the epitope recognized by scFv C21
on both CSPG4 components, provided that the latter are
not noncovalently associated. Furthermore, like scFv #70
(22), scFv C21 recognizes an epitope that is not shared with
xenogeneic CSPG4 counterparts and is distinct, but spatially
close to that recognized by one CSPG4-speciﬁc mouse mAb.
The latter ﬁnding is compatible with similarities in the
recognition of CSPG4 by the human and mouse immune

www.aacrjournals.org

systems, provided that the speciﬁcities of the human scFv
antibodies isolated from the semisynthetic phage display scFv
antibody library are representative of the repertoire of the
human immune system. Finally, like scFv #28 (22) and #61 (16),
scFv C21 recognizes an epitope which is carbohydrate in
nature. However, scFv C21 isolated from the semisynthetic
phage display scFv antibody library, which has highly desirable antibody binding sites because of designed CDR3 (25), has
a higher association constant than the CSPG4-speciﬁc scFv
#28 (22), #70 (22), and #60 (16) isolated by us previously from
the synthetic scFv library (#1; data not shown; ref. 24). At
variance with other scFv antibodies described in the literature
(40), scFv C21 is stable even at low concentrations but forms
aggregates at higher concentrations. However, like other scFv
antibodies, scFv C21, which has an approximate molecular
weight of 27 kDa, has the limitation to have rapid in vivo
clearance with a short half-life (41) and lacks immunologic
effector functions contributed by the Fc region of IgG. To
overcome these limitations, we have generated a fully human
scFv-Fc antibody by fusing scFv C21 to a human IgG1Fc
region. This molecule, which, as a monomer, has an approximate size of 50 kDa, forms dimers as shown by SDS-PAGE and
Western blot analysis (data not shown). Human IgG1Fc region
was selected to generate the fully human scFv-Fc antibody, as
among the human Fc isotypes it is the most effective in
activating complement and has the highest afﬁnity to Fc
receptors (42). Nevertheless, scFv-FcC21 mediated neither
cell-dependent cytotoxicity nor complement-dependent cytotoxicity of CSPG4þ cells in 51Cr release assays. This ﬁnding
may reﬂect the location of the epitope recognized by scFvFcC21 at a site of CSPG4 distant from cell membrane (43–46).
As shown by others and by us, CSPG4 is involved in
the activation of several signaling pathways, including ERK

and FAK, which are known to play an important role in
tumor cell proliferation and migration as well as in tumor
progression (2–4). As a result, blocking, by scFv-FcC21 of
CSPG4 related ERK and FAK pathway signaling, inhibited
effectively tumor cell in vitro growth and migration as
well as in vivo proliferation. In addition, the desirable
afﬁnity of scFv-FcC21 (10 8 mol/L) for tumor percolation
and retention (31, 47) may also play a role in its marked

7418

in vivo antitumor activity. However, the dose of scFv-FcC21
to be used for the treatment of solid tumors has to be
optimized. It is noteworthy that the antitumor activity of
scFv-FcC21 is not markedly inﬂuenced by the CSPG4
expression level on target cells, as the extent of inhibition
of tumor growth was similar for MDA-MB-231 and MV3
cells, which have medium to low [mean ﬂuorescence
intensity (MFI): 71] and high (MFI: 258) CSPG4 expression,
