aggressive B-NHL have primary refractory disease or develop
relapses after treatment with rituximab and chemotherapy,
whereas the efficacy of rituximab is limited in B cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients (3). Thus, the development
of alternative rituximab-based approaches with enhanced tumoricidal activity is warranted, especially toward rituximab-resistant
malignant B cells that currently escape from therapy. In this
respect, it has recently been shown that rituximab-mediated CD20
apoptotic signaling synergizes the proapoptotic activity of various
death receptor agonists. For instance, cotreatment with rituximab
and recombinant human sTRAIL synergistically activates apoptosis
(4). Analogously, we and others have recently shown that cotreatment with rituximab and an agonistic anti-Fas mAb also
synergistically activates apoptosis in malignant B cells (5, 6).
Importantly, although clinical use of anti-Fas antibodies is deemed
impossible due to liver toxicity (7–9), the potential feasibility of
exploiting Fas apoptotic signaling using soluble Fas ligand (sFasL)
has recently been reestablished (10, 11).
Homotrimeric sFasL is nontoxic to normal cells but also lacks
tumoricidal activity (12). In contrast, sFasL hexamers and
secondary aggregated sFasL trimers are highly active toward
tumor cells but are also toxic to liver cells (13–15). Thus, to exploit
activation of Fas apoptotic signaling for cancer therapy, therapeutic strategies have to meet the prerequisite of strictly localized
activation of Fas at the tumor cell surface. This prerequisite can be
met by genetic fusion of sFasL to a tumor-selective scFv antibody
fragment, yielding a trimeric scFv:sFasL fusion protein (10, 11). Like
sFasL trimers, soluble trimeric scFv:sFasL fusion proteins are
inactive or poorly active. However, they acquire strong tumoricidal
activity after specific binding to a preselected cell surface–
expressed target antigen.
Here, we generated a fusion protein comprising a rituximabderived antibody fragment (scFvRit) genetically fused to sFasL,
scFvRit:sFasL, with the aim of exploiting and optimizing the
recently reported synergy between CD20 and Fas apoptotic
signaling. Importantly, scFvRit:sFasL activated both CD20 and
Fas apoptotic signaling, resulting in a far superior proapoptotic
activity compared with cotreatment with rituximab and Fas
agonists. scFvRit:sFasL potently induced CD20-restricted apoptosis in a panel of malignant B-cell lines and primary patientderived malignant B cells (two of two NHL and five of six B-CLL).
In contrast, scFvRit:sFasL lacked activity toward normal human B
cells and lacked systemic toxicity in nude mice. In conclusion,
scFvRit:sFasL efficiently activates CD20 and Fas apoptotic signaling and may be useful for the elimination of malignant
B cells.

Abstract
The clinical efficacy of the CD20-specific chimeric monoclonal
antibody rituximab is significantly hampered by intrinsic or
acquired resistance to therapy. Rituximab activates antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity/complement-dependent cytotoxicity–dependent lysis but also induces apoptosis by
cross-linking of its target antigen CD20. Recent reports indicate that this apoptotic activity of rituximab can be synergized
by cotreatment with Fas agonists. Here, we report on a strategy
designed to exploit and optimize the synergy between
rituximab and Fas signaling by genetically fusing a rituximab-derived antibody fragment to soluble Fas ligand (sFasL).
The resultant fusion protein, designated scFvRit:sFasL,
potently induced CD20-restricted apoptosis in a panel of
malignant B-cell lines (10 of 11) and primary patient-derived
malignant B cells (two of two non–Hodgkin lymphoma and five
of six B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia). ScFvRit:sFasL
efficiently activated CD20 and Fas apoptotic signaling, resulting in a far superior proapoptotic activity compared with
cotreatment with rituximab and Fas agonists. ScFvRit:sFasL
lacked activity toward normal human B cells and also lacked
systemic toxicity in nude mice with no elevation of aspartate
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels or
liver caspase-3 activity. In conclusion, scFvRit:sFasL efficiently
activates CD20 and Fas-apoptotic signaling and may be
useful for the elimination of malignant B cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The tumoricidal activity of the CD20-specific chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab predominantly depends on the
presence of fully functional immune effector mechanisms in the
treated patient, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (1). In addition, part of
the tumoricidal activity of rituximab has been attributed to the
direct activation of apoptosis via cross-linking of cell surface–
expressed CD20 on malignant B cells (2).
Rituximab has markedly improved clinical responses in non–
Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Unfortunately, f50% of patients with

in-frame linker sequence. In the downstream multiple cloning site of pEE14,
a PCR-truncated 539-bp DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain
of human sFasL was inserted. The upstream multiple cloning site of pEE14
was used to insert DNA fragment SfiI-scFvRit-NotI after digestion with
restriction enzymes SfiI and NotI and standard DNA ligation reaction,
yielding plasmid pEE14-scFvRit:sFasL.
Eukaryotic production of scFvRit:sFasL fusion protein. Fusion
protein scFvRit:sFasL was produced using CHO-K1 cells and the glutamine
synthetase selection/amplification system, essentially as previously described (18). Briefly, CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pEE14-scFvRit:sFasL using Fugene-6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Transfectant CHO-K1
cells with amplified expression of scFvRit:sFasL were subjected to single-cell
cloning using a high-speed cell sorter (Cytomation). Subsequently,
individual clones were assessed for stable secretion of scFvRit:sFasL using
a FasL-specific ELISA according to manufacturer’s recommendations (10P’s
BVBA) yielding a CHO-K1 production cell line stably secreting 1.3 Ag/mL
scFvRit:sFasL. scFvRit:sFasL-containing supernatant was harvested by
centrifugation (10,000  g, 10 min), protein was purified using affinity tag
purification and size exclusion chromatography was used to isolate
homotrimeric scFvRit:sFasL.
CD20-specific binding of scFvRit:sFasL. CD20-specific binding of
scFvRit:sFasL was analyzed by incubating CD20-positive BJAB cells (1.0  106
cells) with scFvRit:sFasL (1.34 Ag/mL) in the presence or absence of peptide
Rp10-L (20 mmol/L) or parental mAb rituximab (5 Ag/mL). CD20-specific
binding was analyzed by flow cytometry using PE-conjugated anti-FasL mAb.
Incubations were performed for 45 min at 0jC and were followed by two
washes with serum-free medium.
CD20-restricted induction of apoptosis by scFvRit:sFasL. Tumor cells
were seeded at 0.25  106 per well in a 48-well plate and, unless indicated
otherwise, were treated for 16 h with the indicated concentrations of
scFvRit:sFasL in the presence or absence of rituximab (5 Ag/mL), mAb
ALF2.1 (1 Ag/mL), zIETD-FMK (10 Amol/L), or zVAD-FMK (10 Amol/L).
Assay used to assess apoptosis was Annexin V/propidium iodide staining
for phosphatidyl serine exposure on the outer cell membrane; flow
cytometric analysis of exposure of phosphatidyl serine on the outer
membrane was performed using an Annexin V–FITC/propidium iodide kit
(Nexins). Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DW) was analyzed
with the cell-permeant green-fluorescent lipophilic dye DiOC6 (Molecular
Probes) as previously described (11). Immunoblot analysis of caspase8 activation was performed as described previously (17). Caspase-8 and
caspase-3 activities were assessed using luminescent assays Caspase-Glo
8 and Caspase-Glo 3/7 (Promega Benelux B.V.). Luminescence was
quantified using an ELISA plate reader.
Differential quantification of apoptosis in target and bystander
cells in mixed culture experiments. CD20-positive target cells were
labeled with red fluorescent dye DiI (Molecular probes) by incubating
cells (1.0  106 cells/mL) for 5 min at 37jC in serum-free medium

Materials and Methods
Reagents and mAbs. Actinomycin D (stock solution, 2 mg/mL in
ethanol) and FasL-neutralizing mAb Alf2.1 were from Sigma (SigmaAldrich Chemie B.V.). The caspase-8 inhibitor zIETD-FMK (stock solution,
10 mg/mL in DMSO) and the total caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK (stock
solution, 10 mg/mL in DMSO) were from Calbiochem (VWR International
B.V.). Working solutions of all reagents were prepared by serial dilutions in
standard culture medium. Anti–caspase-8 antibody was from Cell Signaling
Technology. Anti-Fas mAb 7C11 was from Beckman Coulter. Rituximab is
a chimeric mAb, comprising human IgG1–derived constant domains and
VH and VL domains derived from the CD20-specific murine mAb 2B8.
Rituximab was provided by Roche Nederland B.V. Secondary cross-linking
polyclonal goat anti-human (GaHu) antibody was from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. CD19-TRITC was from IQ Products. PE-conjugated
anti-FasL was from Alexis. Peptide Rp10-L is a 12-mer linear peptide
(ITPWPHWLERSSG), previously selected from a phage-display peptide
library to mimic the CD20 epitope recognized by rituximab (16). Rp10-L
peptide was produced and purified by Pepscan Systems. scFvCD7:sFasL was
described previously (11).
Cell lines. CD20-positive B-cell lines are BJAB, Ramos, JY, CA5-I, Jiyoyo,
DEV, SJO, NALM-6, and Raji. CD20-positive B-cell lines PR-1 and Z-138 were
gifts of Prof. Dr. Martin Dyer (Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit,
University of Leicester). The CD20-negative T-cell line MOLT16 was a gift of
Prof. Dr. Martin Gramatzki (Division of Stem Cell and Immunotherapy,
Second Medical Department, University Clinic Schleswig-Holstein). Chinese
hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI (Cambrex)
supplemented with 10% FCS at 37jC in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Isolation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and B cells. Peripheral
blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated as previously described (17). B cells
were obtained by negative selection procedures using the MoFlo high-speed
cell sorter (Cytomation). For experiments, cells were resuspended at
2.0  106 cell/mL in 48-well plates in RPMI supplemented with 10% human
pooled serum.
Construction of scFvRit. The synthetic DNA sequence encoding scFvRit
was generated by splice by overhang extension PCR technology using
published sequence data of the VH and VL domains of the murine antiCD20 mAb 2B8 that are present in rituximab. The VH and VL sequences
were genetically linked via a flexible peptide linker [(GGGGS)3]. Moreover,
restriction enzyme sites SfiI (GGCCCAGCCGG) and NotI (GCGGCCGC)
were added to the 5¶-end and 3¶-end of the sequence, yielding a 756-bp DNA
fragment designated SfiI-scFvRit-NotI.
Construction of scFvRit:sFasL. The coding sequence of scFvRit:sFasL
was inserted in the previously described vector pEE14 (11). Important
features of this vector are the murine n light-chain leader peptide encoded
upstream of two multiple cloning sites that are separated by a 26-residue

containing 5 Amol/L DiI, after which cells were washed thrice with
standard medium. For experiments, DiI-labeled target and nonlabeled
bystander cells were mixed at indicated ratios ( final cell concentration of
0.5  106 cells per well in a 48-well plate). Apoptosis was separately
evaluated in target and bystander cells by phosphatidyl serine exposure to
the outer cell membrane or by DW.
Quantification of the effect of cotreatment of cells with rituximab
and anti-Fas mAb 7C11. The effect of combination treatment of cells with
rituximab and anti-Fas mAb 7C11 was quantified using the cooperativity
index (CI). CI was calculated as (sum of apoptosis induced by single-agent
treatment) / (apoptosis induced by cotreatment). CI was qualified as
follows: CI < 0.9, synergy; 0.9 < CI < 1.1, additive; CI > 1.1, antagonistic.
CD20-restricted induction of apoptosis in patient-derived leukemic
cells. Leukocytes from patients with B-CLL (n = 6) and NHL (n = 2) were
obtained after informed consent ( for individual characteristics, see Table 1).
For experiments, lymphocytes were isolated and plated in a 48-well plate at
a concentration of 2  106 cells/mL, after which cells were treated for
16 h with scFvRit:sFasL (8 ng/mL). Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/
propidium iodide staining. Specific apoptosis was calculated using the
formula (experimental apoptosis
spontaneous apoptosis) / (100
spontaneous apoptosis)  100%.
Assessment of in vivo toxicity of scFvRit:sFasL. Nude mice were
intraoccularly injected with scFvRit:sFasL (30 Ag), Flag-tagged sFasL
(2.5 Ag), secondarily cross-liked with anti-Flag mAb M2 (25 Ag) and antiFlag mAb alone (25 Ag). Mice were continuously monitored for changes in
behavior. After 24 h, mice were sacrificed, and organs and blood were
collected. Isolated blood was used to determine aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels as a measure of tissue
damage. Isolated livers were analyzed for caspase-3/caspase-7 activity using

the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay according to manufacturer’s recommendations
(Promega). Animal care and all experiments performed were in accordance
with federal guidelines and have been approved by university and state
authorities.
Statistical analysis. Data reported are mean values of at least three
independent experiments plus SE. P values were determined using twosided, unpaired Student’s t test. A statistically significant difference was
defined as P < 0.05.

Results
CD20-specific binding and induction of apoptosis by
scFvRit:sFasL. Incubation of CD20-positive BJAB cells with
scFvRit:sFasL resulted in binding to the cell surface of BJAB cells
(Fig. 1A, 2). Binding of scFvRit:sFasL was strongly inhibited by
molar excess of peptide Rp10-L, a peptide that neutralizes CD20specific binding by rituximab (Fig. 1A, 3). Similar competition data
were obtained with rituximab (Fig. 1A, 4). Of note, the high molar
excess of peptide Rp10-L (>500-fold) and rituximab (>5-fold)
required to block scFvRit:sFasL points to a high avidity–type
binding of trimeric scFvRit:sFasL to CD20.
Subsequently, the apoptotic activity of scFvRit:sFasL was
determined on a panel of CD20-positive cell lines and the CD20negative T-cell line MOLT16. Treatment with low concentrations of scFvRit:sFasL potently induced apoptosis in all but one
of the CD20-positive cell lines tested ( for EC50 concentrations, see
Table 2). In contrast, treatment with MOCK-scFv:sFasL, targeted
at the T-cell marker CD7, showed no or only minimal activity

NOTE: Expression levels of CD20 and Fas are represented as mean fluorescent intensity. Mean fluorescent intensity values are representatives of three

and sFasL on the other hand), Ramos cells were also subjected
to cotreatment with rituximab and a control scFv:sFasL fusion
protein with specificity for CD19. CD19 has no known or detectable apoptosis-related signaling activity. Consequently, the
scFvCD19:sFasL fusion protein can be used to exclusively activate
Fas-dependent apoptotic signaling in a manner similar to
scFvRit:sFasL. Importantly, the apoptotic activity of cotreatment
with rituximab and scFvCD19:sFasL did not significantly differ
from the apoptotic activity observed for rituximab and anti-Fas
(Fig. 2A). Moreover, dose-response curves for scFvRit:sFasL and
scFvCD19:sFasL on Ramos cells revealed a striking difference in
their activity (Fig. 2B). ScFvRit:sFasL induced >95% apoptosis
(96.9%; Fig. 2B), whereas a 30-fold higher concentration of
scFvCD19:sFasL only induced f40% apoptosis (40.2%; Fig. 2B).
Taken together, these results strongly point to a quantitatively
superior apoptotic activity of scFvRit:sFasL that proceeds via both
Fas and CD20.
ScFvRit:sFasL activates CD20 apoptotic signaling. Proof for
the presence of CD20 apoptotic signaling by scFvRit:sFasL was
obtained when various tumor cell lines were treated with
scFvRit:sFasL in the presence of the FasL-neutralizing mAb Alf2.1
(Fig. 2C). Treatment of BJAB and Raji cells with scFvRit:sFasL in
the presence of mAb Alf2.1 completely abrogated its apoptotic
activity (BJAB, P = 0.0002, difference = 80.7 F 9.8; Raji, P < 0.0001,
difference = 46.6 F 5.8). In contrast, mAb Alf2.1 failed to inhibit
induction of apoptosis by scFvRit:sFasL in Ramos and PR-1 cells.
In fact, the apoptotic activity of scFvRit:sFasL toward PR-1 cells
was significantly increased upon coincubation with mAb Alf2.1
(P < 0.0001, difference = 17.3 F 2.1). Apparently, induction of apoptosis upon treatment with scFvRit:sFasL and mAb Alf2.1 in Ramos
and PR-1 cells proceeds via CD20 signaling, whereas induction of
apoptosis by scFvRit:sFasL and mAb Alf2.1 in BJAB and Raji cells
results from Fas signaling. Of note, these results do not exclude the
presence of Fas or CD20 signaling in the respective cell lines in the
absence of mAb Alf2.1.
scFvRit:sFasL activates dual Fas and CD20 apoptotic
signaling. To assess whether dual activation of CD20 and Fas
signaling could occur upon treatment with scFvRit:sFasL, Ramos

toward all B-cell lines tested (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). Induction of
apoptosis by scFvRit:sFasL was specifically inhibited by cotreatment with a molar excess (>5-fold) of parental mAb rituximab
(Fig. 1B), indicating that the apoptotic activity of scFvRit:sFasL critically depends on selective binding to cell surface–expressed CD20.
This selective binding to cell surface–expressed CD20 equips
scFvRit:sFasL with the possibility to activate Fas-apoptotic
signaling in neighboring CD20-negative tumor cells. We assessed
this so-called bystander effect by treatment of mixed cultures of
CD20-positive target cells (BJAB) and CD20-negative bystander
cells (MOLT16) with scFvRit:sFasL, followed by separate assessment of apoptosis in BJAB and MOLT16 cells. In these experiments,
treatment with scFvRit:sFasL was associated with strong induction
of apoptosis in MOLT16 bystander cells, which was specifically
inhibited by cotreatment with rituximab (Fig. 1C). In these
bystander experiments, the level of apoptosis in BJAB target cells
was identical to treatment of BJAB cells alone (data not shown).
In a direct comparison of scFvRit:sFasL with CD20-signaling
induced by rituximab, scFvRit:sFasL showed superior apoptotic
activity even when rituximab was secondarily cross-linked to
enhance its proapoptotic activity (Ramos, P < 0.0001, difference =
58.3 F 2.5; BJAB, P < 0.0001, difference = 91.6 F 5.0; Nalm-6,
P = 0.0004, difference = 55.1 F 7.9; Fig. 1D). Of note, in most cell
lines tested, rituximab-mediated apoptosis did not exceed 50%
even at a concentration of 20 Ag/mL (data not shown).
The apoptotic activity of scFvRit:sFasL is superior to
cotreatment with rituximab and anti-Fas. To determine the
efficacy of induction of apoptosis by scFvRit:sFasL, we compared
scFvRit:sFasL treatment with the recently reported synergistic
combination of rituximab and anti-Fas mAb 7C11. Cotreatment of
Ramos cells with optimal concentrations of rituximab (5 Ag/mL)
and mAb 7C11 (2 Ag/mL) synergistically induced apoptosis (CI,
0.79; Fig. 2A). Strikingly, treatment with only 5 ng/mL of scFvRit:
sFasL induced apoptosis in over 95% of tumor cells, indicative of a
quantitatively superior apoptotic activity of this agent (P < 0.0001,
difference = 52.7 F 4.9; Fig. 2A).
To exclude that this difference in apoptotic activity was due
to the use of different Fas-agonists (i.e., anti-Fas on the one hand

apparent within the first 6 h in Ramos cells, and CD20-apoptotic
signaling, apparent at later time points.
Of note, treatment with rituximab and anti-Fas or scFvCD19:sFasL
was abrogated by caspase-8 inhibition or overexpression of XIAP
(Fig. 3A and B), which suggests that Fas-mediated caspase signaling
is critical for apoptosis induced by rituximab and anti-Fas, as well as
scFvCD19:sFasL.
scFvRit:sFasL induces potent apoptosis in primary patientderived tumor B cells. Treatment of primary malignant B cells of
leukemic NHL and B-CLL patients with scFvRit:sFasL resulted in
specific induction of apoptosis in two of two NHL and seven of eight
B-CLL (Table 2). For the patient-derived B-CLL cells, the median
induction of apoptosis by scFvRit:sFasL was 40.4% (interquartile
range, 15.2-50.3%). Induction of apoptosis by scFvRit:sFasL was dose
dependent (Fig. 4A) and exceeded the induction of apoptosis by
scFvCD19:sFasL (P = 0.0083, difference = 30.2 F 4.8; Fig. 4B). Of note,
cell surface expression of CD19 was higher than CD20 (data not
shown), suggesting that the difference in activity is not due to
preferential or higher binding of scFvRit:sFasL.
scFvRit:sFasL lacks toxicity in nude mice. Previously, Samel
et al. reported that a homotrimeric scFv:sFasL fusion protein,
targeted to the stroma marker FAP, is nontoxic for murine liver
in vivo (10). Indeed, treatment of nude mice with a high amount of
scFvRit:sFasL (30 Ag per mouse) did not reveal any liver toxicity, as
evidenced by normal blood AST levels, ALT levels, and a lack of liver
caspase-3/caspase-7 activity (Fig. 4C). In contrast, treatment with

cells were treated with scFvRit:sFasL. At early time points,
scFvRit:sFasL induced typical Fas-associated apoptotic features,
including procaspase-8 processing within 3 h and initiator caspase8 and effector caspase-3 proteolytic activity within 6 h (Fig. 2D).
Despite early caspase-8 processing, caspase-8 inhibitor zIETDFMK or overexpression of the caspase-8 inhibitor cFLIPL did not
significantly block apoptosis after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 3A and B,
respectively). Similarly, overexpression of effector caspase inhibitor
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) failed to inhibit
apoptosis induced by scFvRit:sFasL (Fig. 3B). In contrast, overexpression of the mitochondrial antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2
abrogated the activity of scFvRit:sFasL (Fig. 3C).
Subsequent time course experiments with Ramos cells revealed
that the apoptotic activity of scFvRit:sFasL was comparable with
the activity of scFvCD19:sFasL during the initial 6 h of treatment
(open squares and open triangles, respectively; Fig. 3D), most likely
as a result of the activation of Fas signaling by both reagents. In
contrast, at later time points, scFvRit:sFasL-induced apoptosis proceeded to >90%, whereas induction of apoptosis by scFvCD19:sFasL
did not further increase after 6 h and reached a maximum of
only 40%. In a similar time-course experiment with Ramos.cFLIPL
cells, the apoptotic activity of scFvRit:sFasL only became apparent
f6 h after start of treatment (Fig. 3D, solid squares), whereas the
apoptotic activity of scFvCD19:sFasL was fully abrogated (Fig. 3D,
solid triangles). Together, these results strongly suggest that
scFvRit:sFasL can simultaneously activate Fas-apoptotic signaling,

apoptotic signaling by genetically fusing a rituximab-derived
antibody fragment to sFasL. Selective and high affinity binding of
the resultant scFvRit:sFasL fusion protein to CD20 leads to its
accretion at the tumor cell surface and to concomitant potent
apoptotic activity in B-cell lines and primary NHL and B-CLL
patient-derived B-cell tumor cells at low picomolar concentrations.
The antitumor activity of scFvRit:sFasL depends on binding to cell
surface CD20, because cotreatment with parental mAb rituximab
strongly inhibited the induction of apoptosis by scFvRit:sFasL.
Interestingly, there is no clear correlation between the expression
levels of either CD20 or Fas and the proapoptotic activity of
scFvRit:sFasL (Table 1). Thus, although CD20-specific accretion to
the tumor cell surface is required for the proapoptotic activity of
scFvRit:sFasL, the sensitivity of each respective cell line is most
likely a result of not only CD20 and Fas expression, but also of the
intricate interplay of a variety of intracellular modulators of
apoptosis, for instance cFLIPL and proapoptotic or antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members.
A distinguishing feature of scFvRit:sFasL is that it does not
only induce Fas apoptotic signaling but also induces apoptosis
via a CD20-dependent signaling pathway. The specific binding to
CD20 and the simultaneous monocellular or bicellular binding to
Fas confers potent CD20 signaling activity to scFvRit:sFasL. This
is exemplified by the fact that the CD20-mediated signaling of
scFvRit:sFasL was detected at picomolar concentrations, whereas
activation of CD20 signaling by rituximab typically required
micromolar concentrations. Although not investigated here, this

secondarily cross-linked sFasL was associated with severe toxicity in
mice with >30-fold increase in AST-levels (P = 0.0027, difference =
1.3  105 F 1.9  104), a >140-fold increase in ALT-levels (P < 0.0001,
difference = 1.3 105 F 3.7 103), and a 15-fold increase in
caspase-3/caspase-7 activity (P = 0.0065, difference = 37.3 F 7.2).
scFvRit:sFasL lacks toxicity toward purified normal B cells
and PBLs. Treatment with rituximab induces a massive depletion
of normal B cells (19), which is most likely a result of activation of
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or complementdependent cytotoxicity by the Fc domain of rituximab. Because
scFvRit:sFasL does not contain an Fc domain but does activate
CD20-signaling, we subsequently assessed whether the simultaneous binding to CD20 and Fas induced unwanted apoptotic
effects in purified normal CD20-positive B cells. However,
scFvRit:sFasL did not significantly induce apoptosis in these cells
(medium, 15.5%; scFvRit:sFasL, 24.0%; Fig. 4D).
Binding of scFvRit:sFasL to normal B cells may lead to an
innocent bystander effect toward other human blood cells, e.g.,
T cells. However, treatment of PBLs, containing f10% B cells,
with scFvRit:sFasL did not reveal significant apoptotic activity in
any of the normal blood cell types assessed (medium, 15.7%;
scFvRit:sFasL, 18.3%; Fig. 4D).

Discussion
Here, we reported on a novel strategy designed to exploit and
optimize the synergy between rituximab-induced CD20 and Fas

Augmented Apoptotic Activity of scFvRit:sFasL

including intrinsic or acquired resistance to complement-dependent cytotoxicity due to overexpression of CD55 and CD59 (22–24).
Because scFvRit:sFasL directly induces apoptosis, which solely
requires the cross-linking of CD20 and Fas, scFvRit:sFasL may be
particularly relevant for patients with poor or absent complementdependent cytotoxicity. In addition, treatment with rituximab has
been proposed to lead to the development of CD20-negative
relapses in some patients, possibly due to tumor cell heterogeneity
(25, 26). For scFvRit:sFasL, the reciprocal activation of Fas by CD20immobilized scFvRit:sFasL opens up the possibility to induce
apoptosis in neighboring FasL-sensitive leukemic cells that have
lost CD20 expression. In our mixed culture experiments, bystander
tumor cells were eliminated at target to bystander ratio as low as
1:99. This potent bystander effect of scFvRit:sFasL may help to
prevent the occurrence of CD20-negative relapses.
Initial reports on Fas agonists described severe toxic effects
toward murine hepatocytes. More recently, this toxicity has been
ascribed to multimers or aggregates of sFasL, whereas homotrimeric sFasL is nontoxic to liver cells. In an initial screening for
toxicity, treatment with up to 30 Ag of scFvRit:sFasL did not induce
liver damage in nude mice, which indicates that homotrimeric
scFvRit:sFasL is inactive and nontoxic toward normal cells.
Moreover, scFvRit:sFasL was devoid of apoptotic activity toward
normal human purified B cells and PBLs in vitro. Obviously, a

efficient CD20 signaling could be a result of scFvRit:sFasL–
induced hypercross-linking of CD20. Hypercross-linking of CD20
by a dextran polymer of rituximab has recently been shown to
strongly potentiate CD20-mediated induction of apoptosis (20).
In line with this hypothesis, the proapoptotic activity of scFvRit:
sFasL on PR-1 cells was further increased upon coincubation
with mAb Alf2.1. Apparently, secondary cross-linking of PR-1
cells further potentiates CD20 signaling. Such a potentiation of
apoptosis is an effect also known to occur upon secondary
cross-linking of rituximab (21).
Intriguingly, CD20 apoptotic signaling induced by scFvRit:sFasL
did not critically depend on caspase signaling. In contrast,
apoptosis by secondarily cross-linked rituximab or by cotreatment
with rituximab and anti-Fas did depend on caspase signaling.
Apparently, CD20 signaling can vary markedly, depending on the
manner of cross-linking, e.g., experimental secondary cross-linking
of the Fc domain of rituximab versus cross-linking of CD20 by
simultaneous CD20 and Fas binding of scFvRit:sFasL. Based on the
fact that caspase activity is not required while Bcl-2 overexpression
blocks scFvRit:sFasL activity, it seems likely that DNases released
from the mitochondria may be involved in CD20 apoptotic
signaling by scFvRit:sFasL.
Primary refractory disease or the development of relapses after
rituximab treatment has been attributed to several mechanisms,

future in-depth toxicologic evaluation in, e.g., a human CD20
transgenic animal, as well as pharmacokinetic studies, are required
to accurately assess the applicability of scFvRit:sFasL.
