ABSTRACT
Both epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that ethanol may
enhance aggressiveness of breast cancer. We have previously demonstrated that
short term exposure to ethanol (12–48 hours) increased migration/invasion in
breast cancer cells overexpressing ErbB2, but not in breast cancer cells with low
expression of ErbB2, such as MCF7, BT20 and T47D breast cancer cells. In this study,
we showed that chronic ethanol exposure transformed breast cancer cells that were
not responsive to short term ethanol treatment to a more aggressive phenotype.
Chronic ethanol exposure (10 days - 2 months) at 100 (22 mM) or 200 mg/dl (44 mM)
caused the scattering of MCF7, BT20 and T47D cell colonies in a 3-dimension culture
system. Chronic ethanol exposure also increased colony formation in an anchorageindependent condition and stimulated cell invasion/migration. Chronic ethanol
exposure increased cancer stem-like cell (CSC) population by more than 20 folds.
Breast cancer cells exposed to ethanol in vitro displayed a much higher growth rate
and metastasis in mice. Ethanol selectively activated p38γ MAPK and RhoC but not
p38α/β in a concentration-dependent manner. SP-MCF7 cells, a derivative of MCF7
cells which compose mainly CSC expressed high levels of phosphorylated p38γ MAPK.
Knocking-down p38γ MAPK blocked ethanol-induced RhoC activation, cell scattering,
invasion/migration and ethanol-increased CSC population. Furthermore, knockingdown p38γ MAPK mitigated ethanol-induced tumor growth and metastasis in mice.
These results suggest that chronic ethanol exposure can enhance the aggressiveness
of breast cancer by activating p38γ MAPK/RhoC pathway.

cells to invade and metastasize [5–7]. Nonetheless,
the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Various
experimental models have been employed to investigate
the effect of alcohol on breast cancer. The epidemiological
data are supported by experimental studies which show
that alcohol promotes mammary tumorigenesis/metastasis
in animals, stimulates migration/invasion of breast
tumor cells and enhances the expression of markers for
epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cell culture systems
[8–22].
Previous studies show that short-term treatment of
alcohol, that is, exposure for 12–48 hours, is sufficient

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer among American women [1]. Although the exact
etiology for breast cancer initiation and development is
unclear, environmental factors play an important role.
Epidemiological studies indicate that alcohol consumption
significantly increases the risk for breast cancer in a
concentration- and duration-dependent manner [2–4]. In
addition to the promotion of breast cancer carcinogenesis,
alcohol may also enhance the growth of existing breast
tumors and increase the aggressiveness of breast cancer

to alter the behaviors of breast cancer cells, resulting in
enhanced aggressiveness. However, breast cancer cells
display differential sensitivity to alcohol exposure, that is,
some cells are much more sensitive to alcohol exposure
and some are not responsive [15]. For example, the shortterm alcohol exposure stimulates the migration/invasion
of breast cancer cells expressing high levels of ErbB2/
HER2 [8, 12–15]. This may result from alcohol-induced
amplification of ERbB2 signaling. However, some
breast cancer cells, particularly the breast cells that
express low levels of ErbB2, such as MCF7, T47D and
BT20 cells, are quite resistant to alcohol exposure; the
short-term treatment of alcohol has little effect on their
migration/invasion behavior. We hypothesize that a longterm treatment of alcohol is required to convert these
“alcohol-resistant” cells to a more aggressive phenotype.
In this study, we showed that long- term treatment of
alcohol, 10 days-2 months, significantly increased the
migration/invasion, cancer stem-like cell population and
tumorigenicity in “alcohol-resistant” cells in vitro and in
vivo. We further demonstrated that p38γ MAPK played
an important role in alcohol-promoted aggressiveness in
these cells. p38γ MAPK is one of four members of the
p38 MAPK family [23]. Recent studies indicate that
p38γ MAPK is implicated in breast cancer progression
and aggressiveness [24]. We showed here that alcohol
selectively activated p38γ MAPK and its down-stream
effector, RhoC, resulting in enhanced aggressiveness of
breast cancer cells.

but chronic ethanol exposure increased the scattering
of these cells (Figure 1C). Noscattering spheroids were
observed in control MCF7, T47D and BT20 cells.
Chronic ethanol exposure-enhanced malignancy was
also supported by the increase in anchorage-independent
colony formation (Figure 1D). In addition, chronic ethanol
exposure increased the migration/invasion of MCF7 cells
(Figure 2). In this experiment, MCF7 cells were exposed
to ethanol (100 mg/dl) for 10 days, 1 month or 2 months,
and then assayed for their migration/invasion during a
12 hour-period in an ethanol free environment. Chronic
ethanol exposure significantly increased migratory
(Figure 2A) and invasive potential of MCF7 cells (Figure
2C); however, only the effect of ethanol on invasion was
duration-dependent. Continuous ethanol presence in the
medium further increased the migration/invasion (Figure
2B and 2D). Once again, it was confirmed that shortterm ethanol exposure failed to alter migration/invasion
of MCF7 cells (comparing the solid bars in Figure 2B
and 2D: control versus acute ethanol exposure). Chronic
ethanol exposure caused a modest decrease in cell number;
this may result from either a slight inhibition of cell
proliferation or decrease in cell viability (Figure 2E). Next,
we tested the effect of ethanol on T47D and BT20 cells.
Similar to MCF7 cells, we have previously demonstrated
that both T47D and BT20 cells were insensitive to acute
ethanol exposure due to low ErbB2 expression [15]. Here,
we confirmed that short-term ethanol exposure (12 hours)
did not affect the migration of T47D and BT20 cells
(Figure 3A and 3C); however, chronic ethanol exposure
(10 days) significantly increased the migration of these
cells (Figure 3B and 3D).
We further demonstrated that chronic ethanol
exposure significantly increased cancer stem-like cell
population (Figure 4). In this experiment, MCF7 cells
were exposed to ethanol (100 or 200 mg/dl) for 10 days
and then evaluated for the stem-like cell population.
Ethanol caused a concentration-dependent increase in
stem-like cell population.

RESULTS
Ethanol converts less aggressive breast cancer
cells to a more aggressive phenotype
MCF7 cells are a less aggressive breast cancer line
and display modest invasion and metastatic potential.
Our previous study indicated that the short term ethanol
exposure (12–48 hours) had little effect on the behaviors
of MCF7 breast cancer cells [15]. We first examined
the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on MCF7 cells.
MCF7 cells were exposed to ethanol (100 or 200 mg/
dl) for 10 days~2 months at concentrations relevant
to human alcohol consumption and then grown in an
ethanol-free 3-D Matrigel system for an additional 10
days. It was reported that aggressive breast cancer cells,
such as MB231, have a property to grow to scattering
spheroids in 3-D culture system [24]. Ethanol increased
the scattering of MCF7 cells in a concentration- and
duration-dependent manner (Figure 1A) which indicated
an enhanced aggressiveness. The continuous presence
of ethanol after chronic exposure further increased the
scattering (Figure 1B). A similar effect of ethanol on
T47D and BT20 breast cancer cells was observed (Figure
1C). Both T47D and BT20 cells are less aggressive and
barely respond to short term ethanol exposure [14, 15],

Breast cancer cells pre-exposed to ethanol
display higher tumorigenicity in vivo
To confirm that chronic ethanol exposure indeed
converted breast cancer cells to a more malignant phenotype,
we treated MCF7 cells with ethanol (0 or 100 mg/dl) for
a month and then xenografted these cells in to nude mice.
Our data showed that MCF7 cells that were pretreated with
ethanol exhibited significantly higher tumorigenicity (Figure
5A) and tumor growth rate (Figure 5B).

studies, we showed that tumors developed by ethanol
pre-exposed MCF7 cells exhibited higher expression
of phospho-p38γ MAPK (Figure 5C), suggesting that
p38γ MAPK may be involved in ethanol-promoted
aggressiveness. We first investigated whether chronic
ethanol exposure activated p38γ MAPK. Using the
immunoprecipitation assay withcommercial antibodies,
we showed that chronic ethanol exposure increased the
phosphorylation of p38γ MAPK in MCF7 cells, but not

other isoforms of p38 MAPK (Figures 6A–6C). Only
results on p38α are presented and the data on other
isoforms are not shown. In contrast, the short term ethanol
exposure (0.5–12 hours) did not alter the phosphorylation
of p38γ MAPK (Figure 6D). To further validate the
finding, we generated a phospho-specific antibody
directed against p38γ MAPK with the assistance of 21st
Century Biochemical (Marlboro, MA). This antibody was
specific for phospho-p38γ MAPK and did not cross react

with other p38 MAPK isoforms (Figure 6E). Using this
antibody, we confirmed that chronic ethanol exposure
specifically increased the phosphorylation of p38γ MAPK
(Figure 6F). Using this antibody, we compared the levels
of phosphorylated p38γ MAPK between MCF7 cells and
its derivative, SP-MCF7 cells, a Hoechst dye excluding
mammary cell subline which have more cancer stem-like
cell population [25–27]. As shown in Figure 6G, SPMCF7 cells expressed more phosphorylated p38γ MAPK
than MCF7 cells.

The critical role of ethanol-induced aggressiveness
of breast cancer was further confirmed in animal studies.
MCF7 cells expressing control shRNA or shRNA
for p38γ were exposed to ethanol (100 mg/dl) for a
month and then inoculated to nude mice. As shown
in Figure 9A, expression of shRNA for p38γ MAPK
significantly blocked ethanol-stimulated tumor growth
in nude mice. Furthermore, the knock down p38γ MAPK
by the shRNA blocked ethanol-induced lung metastasis
(Figures 9B and 9C).

p38γ MAPK mediates ethanol-increased
aggressiveness of breast cancer cells

Mechanisms underlying p38γ MAPK-mediated
aggressiveness of breast cancer cells

To confirm the involvement of p38γ MAPK in
ethanol-enhanced aggressiveness of breast cancer cells,
we established MCF7 cells with a stable expression
of either control shRNA (Consh) or shRNA for p38γ
MAPK (p38γsh) (Figure 7A). Knocking down p38γ
MAPK inhibited ethanol-induced cell scattering in the
3-D culture system (Figure 7B) and the anchorageindependent colony formation (Figure 7C). Knocking
down p38γ MAPK also blocked ethanol-stimulated
cell migration (Figure 8A) and invasion (Figure 8B).
Furthermore, knocking down p38γ MAPK inhibited an
ethanol-induced increase in stem-like cell population
(Figure 8C). Down-regulation of p38γ MAPK did not
alter cell viability (Figure 8D).

RhoC is a key protein that mediates the cell shape
and motility and is implicated in the aggressiveness of
breast cancer [28, 29]. It has been reported that p38γ
MAPK may regulate the levels of RhoC by controlling
its degradation [24]. We first sought to determine
whether ethanol altered the levels of RhoC and then
to investigate the role of p38γ MAPK in ethanolinduced alteration of RhoC. As shown in Figure 10A,
chronic ethanol exposure increased the levels of RhoC
in MCF7 cells. Knocking down p38γ MAPK blocked
ethanol-mediated increase of RhoC (Figure 10B).
p38γ MAPK may alter RhoC levels by regulating its
ubiquitin-dependent degradation [24]. We showed that
ethanol decreased the ubiquitination of RhoC and down-

regulation of p38γ MAPK increased the ubiquitination
of RhoC (Figure 10C). Together, these results suggested
that ethanol-mediated p38γ MAPK activation inhibited
ubiquitination of RhoC, resulting in increased in RhoC
levels. To confirm the role of RhoC in ethanol-induced
aggressiveness, we knocked down RhoC expression by

specific siRNA and examined the effect of ethanol on the
migration/invasion of MCF7 cells. As shown in Figures
10D and 10E, RhoC siRNA effectively inhibited ethanolinduced migration and invasion, confirming that it played
a critical role in ethanol-induced aggressiveness of breast
cancer cells.

to ethanol in vitro display a much higher rate of growth
and metastasis in mice. It appears that p38γ MAPK plays
an important role in ethanol-promoted aggressiveness.
Knocking-down p38γ MAPK blocks ethanol-stimulated
cell scattering, invasion/migration, an increase in CSC
population as well as in vivo tumor growth and metastasis.
We have previously demonstrated that short term
exposure to ethanol (12–48 hours) increased migration/
invasion in breast cancer cells overexpressing ErbB2, but
not in breast cancer cells with low expression of ErbB2,
such as MCF7, BT20 and T47D breast cancer cells [15].
The current study indicates that given enough time ethanol

can stimulate breast cancer cells that are not responsive
to short term ethanol exposure. It appears the effect of
ethanol is not reversible at least in the present experimental
models. This is demonstrated by the results that the effect
of ethanol on cell scattering, colony formation, migration/
invasion and CSC population is persistent even after the
removal of ethanol. Similarly, it appears that breast cancer
cells treated with ethanol in vitro have acquired greater
potential to grow and metastasize in mice that are free of
ethanol exposure. It is noted that continuous presence of
ethanol further enhances the stimulatory effect of chronic
ethanol exposure (Figures 1B, 2B and 2D).

p38 MAPK in MCF7 cells (Figure 6D). Instead, we show
that chronic ethanol exposure specifically increases the
phosphorylation of p38γ MAPK but not other isoforms
of p38 (Figure 6). The effect of ethanol on p38γ MAPK
phosphorylation parallels its effect on cell behaviors, that
is, only chronic exposure to ethanol has stimulatory effects
on cell scattering, colony formation, migration/invasion
and CSC population.
The p38 MAPK family is comprised of four
members, p38α, p38β, p38γ and p38δ. The first isoform
p38α was identified in 1994 as a 38 kDa polypeptide
that is activated in response to endotoxin treatment, cell
stress or cytokines [23]. Three additional isoforms were
described later: p38β, p38γ and p38δ. These kinases
share highly similar protein sequences; p38α and p38β
are 75% identical, whereas p38γ and p38δ are 62% and
61% identical to p38α, respectively. In turn, p38γ and
p38δ are 70% identical to each other. The four p38MAPK
isoforms are widely expressed, although p38β, p38γ and
p38δ expression appear to be higher in specific tissues;
for example, p38β is abundant in brain, p38γ in skeletal
muscle, and p38δ in endocrine glands [23]. In general, all
p38MAPKs are strongly activated by a wide variety of
environmental and cellular stresses or by inflammatory
cytokines and are poorly activated by serum or growth
factors [23]. The canonical activation of p38 MAPKs
occurs via dual phosphorylation of their Thr–Gly–Tyr
motif, in the activation loop, by mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase (MKK) 3/6 (MKK3 and MKK6) [23]. Upon
activation, the dually phosphorylated p38MAPK goes
through characteristic global conformational changes that
alters the alignment of the two kinase halves (N-terminal
and C-terminal domains) of the folded protein and
enhances access to the substrate, which together increases
enzymatic activity. To date, most studies of the p38MAPK
pathways focused on function of the p38α and p38β
isoform, which is widely considered to negatively regulate
malignant transformation; nonetheless, few reports address
the p38γ and p38δ isoforms. Although p38γ and p38δ can
phosphorylate typical p38 MAPK substrates such as the
transcription factors ATF2, Elk-1 or SAP1, they cannot
phosphorylate some substrates of p38α and p38β and have
their unique substrates [23] .
Recent studies indicate that p38γ may have some
particular implications in breast cancer. For example,
Meng et al. [30] showed that p38γ is overexpressed in
highly metastatic human and mouse breast cancer cell lines
and p38γ expression is preferentially associated with basallike and metastatic phenotypes of breast tumor samples.
Clinical evidence shows that elevated expression of p38γ
is associated with lower overall survival of patients with
breast cancer [24]. Using a computational mechanical
model, Rosenthal et al further showed that p38γ can
regulate the changes of cytoskeleton and cell shape of
breast cancer cells and control cell motility. This evidence
suggests an important role of p38γin the aggressiveness of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

breast cancer. However, it is unclear how p38γ is activated
and how itregulates the aggressiveness of breast cancer
cells. It is reported that p38γ can regulate RhoC expression
by mediating RhoC protein stability through regulation of
RhoC ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation [24]. We
demonstrate that ethanol-induced activation of p38γinhibits
the ubiquitination of RhoC, therefore increasing the
stability of RhoC protein (Figure 10). More importantly,
down-regulation of RhoC is sufficient to inhibit ethanolinduced migration and invasion in MCF7 cells. This
suggests that p38γ and RhoC pathway plays an important
role in ethanol-promoted aggressiveness of breast cancer.
It is currently unclear regarding the mechanisms of
how ethanol specifically activates p38γ. One possibility
is that the effect of ethanol is mediated through the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) is the major
upstream kinase that activate p38γ and its activity is
regulated by intracellular ROS concentration [31]. MKK6
activation in turn can enhance ROS production through
NADPH oxidase [32]. Ethanol oxidation produces ROS.
Although ethanol metabolism mainly occurs in the liver
and is mediated by hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase IB
(ADH1B), breast cancer cells are shown to express
moderate levels of cytochrome P450 2E1, another enzyme
to oxidize ethanol. We have previously demonstrated
that ethanol increases intracellular ROS accumulation in
breast cancer cells [15, 21]. Therefore, it is possible that
ethanol activates ROS-p38γ-RhoC pathway which results
in enhanced aggressiveness of breast cancer.

Cell culture and ethanol exposure

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation

MCF7 and T47D were grown in DMEM medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% AntiAnti. BT20 cells were cultured in EMEM medium
containing 10% FBS, 1% Anti-Anti, 3 mM glucose
and 2 mM glutamine. SP-MCF7 (side populationMCF7) cells, a Hoechst dye excluding mammary cell
subline, were a gift from Dr. Xiuwei Yang (University
of Kentucky). Cells were maintained at 37°C with 5%
CO2. A range of physiologically relevant concentrations
of ethanol (0, 100, 200, or 400 mg/dl, i.e., 0, 22, 44 or
88 mM) was used in this study. Ethanol at 100 mg/dl
(22 mM) was used in the most experiments. A method
utilizing sealed containers was used to maintain ethanol
concentrations in the culture medium. With this method,
ethanol concentrations in the culture medium can be
accurately maintained [33]. The containers were placed
in a humidified environment and maintained at 37°C with
5% CO2.

Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (150
mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium
deoxycholate) containing 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1
mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 μg/ml
of aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml of leupeptin. The procedure
for immunoblotting has been previously described (27).
Briefly, protein samples were clarified by centrifugation
at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and resolved by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE). The separated proteins were transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were
probed with the indicated primary antibodies, followed
by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies, and developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence.
For immunoprecipitation, equal amount of proteins
(about 500–800 μg) were incubated with anti-p38γ,
p38α, phosphorylated-p38 (p-p38), phosphorylated-p38γ
(p-p38γ) or ubiquitin antibodies at 4°C overnight. The
protein/antibody complex was treated with Protein A/G
beads conjugated to agarose at 4°C for 4 hours, and then
centrifuged at 5,000 g for 5 min. Samples were washed
5 times with RIPA buffer, 1 time with cold-TBS, and
then boiled in sample buffer (187.5 mM Tri-HCl, pH
6.8, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mM DTT and 0.03%
bromophenol blue). Proteins were resolved in SDS PAGE
and analyzed by immunoblotting.

Generation of phospho-specific antibody against
p38γ MAPK
Affinity-purified antibodies specifically against
the dual-phosphorylation motif, Thr-Gly-Tyr [34] which
is located in the activation loop [Thr(p) 180/Tyr(p)
182) on p38γ MAPK] were generated at 21st Century
Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA). Rabbits were immunized
with the phosphorylated p38γ peptide Acetyl-SEM[pT]
G[pY]VVT-Ahx-C-amide and serum was affinity
purified.

MTT assay
The MTT assay was performed to determine the
number of viable cells as previously described [21].
Briefly, equal amount of cells were plated into 96well plates and cultured for 24 hours. After that, 10 μl
of MTT reagent was added to each well and the plates
were incubated at 37°C for 4 hours. The cultures were
solubilized and spectrophotometric absorbance was
measured at 595 nm using a microtiter platereader
(Beckman coulter).

Generation of cells stably expressing p38γ
shRNA
To generate stable cell lines with silencing of
p38γ, briefly, MCF7 cells were transfected with either
scrambled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) as controls or
shRNA for p38γ MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using
a Neon Transfection apparatus (Life Technologies). Cells
expressing these shRNA were selected by the treatment
of puromycin (4 μg/ml). Cell lysates were collected and
the down-regulation of p38γ MAPK was confirmed by
immunoblotting.

Cell invasion and migration
Cell invasion was assayed using Matrigel Invasion
Chambers (BD Biosciences). Cell migration was
analyzed using a Transwell Migration System (Costar).
Briefly, equal amount of cells were placed on the upper
compartment of invasion chambers or Transwell chambers
(8.0 μm pore size) which contained serum-free medium.
Culture medium containing 10% FBS was added to the
lower compartment of invasion/migration chambers to
serve as chemoattractants. The chambers were cultured at
37°C in 5% CO2 in the presence or absence of ethanol
(100 mg/dl) for 12 hours. The invaded/migrated cells
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5%
crystal violet in 2% ethanol. Membranes were washed

Three-dimensional cell culture assay
The three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture system
was established as previously described [35]. Briefly, 24well plates were pre-coated with 150 μl Matrigel Matrix
(BD Biosciences). Single cell suspension (103 per well)
were mixed with 200 μl ice-cold Matrigel and seeded
in the pre-coated 24-well plates. After 30 min gelling,
culture medium was added to the plates and the medium
was changed every 2 to 3 days. The cell morphology was
captured by a Zeiss Axiovert 40C photomicroscope.

and the dye was eluted with 10% acetic acid. Absorbance
was measured at 595 nm using a microtiter plate reader
(Beckman coulter).

Anchorage-independent colony formation was
assayed as previously described [36]. Briefly, 5,000
cells were mixed with 0.3% agar in culture medium.
The mixture was plated on the top of 1% agar in sixwell plates with an addition of 1 ml of medium. The
medium was changed every 3 to 4 days. The cultures were
incubated for a month at 37°C in 5% CO2, and stained
with 0.5 ml of 0.005% Crystal Violet. Colonies (diameter
≥ 0.1 mm) were counted using a dissecting microscope,
and images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert 40C
photomicroscope.

Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To
test the tumorigenicity, MCF7 cells (103 - 106 cells/100 μl
PBS) that were exposed to ethanol (0 or 100 mg/dl) were
subcutaneously inoculated into both sides of the lower
flank of nude mice. For each group, there were six mice.
One month after the inoculation, tumors in each mouse
were determined. To determine the effect of p38γ MAPK
knock-down on the growth of tumors, MCF7 stably
expressing control shRNA or p38γ shRNA were exposed
to ethanol (0 or 100 mg/dl) for a month. These cells (5 ×
106 cells/100 μl PBS) were inoculated in to nude mice.
Tumor size was measured weekly using a caliper. Tumor
volumes were calculated using the formula: volume
(mm3) = (length x width2)/2. Mice were euthanized
approximately one month after injection. Metastases in
lung were analyzed as previously described [18].

Assaying Stem-like cell population assay

Immunohistochemical staining

The stem-like tumor cells were identified by
measuring aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity
(ALDEFLUOR assay). The ALDEFLUOR assay was
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Stemcell Technologies). ALDH enzymatic activity was
determined by flow cytometry as previously described
[37, 38]. Briefly, after chronic exposure to ethanol (0,
100 or 200 mg/dl), cells were collected and 106 cells
were incubated in ALDEFLUOR assay buffer containing
ALDH substrate (1 μmol/l per 1 × 106 cells) for 40
minutes at 37°C. Some cells were treated under identical
conditions with a specific ALDH inhibitor (50 mmol/l,
diethylaminobenzaldehyde) as a negative control. Cells
were sorted using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton
Dickinson) and analyzed using the WINMDI software.
The results were presented relative to the controls.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was
performed as described [18]. Briefly, tumor tissues and
lungs were removed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and then transferred to 30% sucrose. Tissues were
sectioned at 10 μm thickness using a Cryostat Microtome
(Thermo Scientific). Tumor tissues were stained with
phosphorylated p38γ using Diaminobenzidine (DAB)
kit. Briefly, tissues were incubated with 0.3% H2O2
in methanol for 30 min at room temperature and then
treated with 0.1% TritonX-100 for 10 min. The sections
were washed twice with PBS and then blocked with 1%
BSA and 0.05% TritonX-100 for 1 hour. The sections
were incubated with phospho-p38γ antibody (1:300)
overnight at 4°C. Negative controls were performed
by omitting the primary antibody. After being rinsed in
PBS, sections were incubated with a biotinylated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)
for an hour at room temperature. The sections were
washed three times with PBS and incubated with in an
avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (1:100) for an hour and
developed in 0.05% 3,3′- Diaminobenzidine (Invitrogen)
containing 0.003% H2O2 in PBS. To examine the lung
metastasis, the sections of lung tissues were stained with
eosin and images were recorded using an Olympus BX51
microscope.

Anchorage-independent colony formation

siRNA and cell transfection
Transient transfection of RhoC siRNA (RhoC
siRNA) or scrambled siRNA (Con siRNA) (San Cruz
Biotech) was performed using a Neon Transfection
System (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, MCF7 cells were
exposed to ethanol (0 or 100 mg/dl) for 10 days, and then
electroporated with Con siRNA or RhoC siRNA using a
Neon transfection apparatus. After electroporation, cells
were incubated for 48 hours, and then assayed for cell
migration/invasion in the presence or absence of ethanol
(100 mg/dl).

Statistics
Differences among treatment groups were analyzed
using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences in
which p was less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. In cases where significant differences were
detected, specific post-hoc comparisons between treatment
groups were examined with Student-Newman-Keuls tests.
The prevalence of lung metastasis between control and
alcohol-treated groups was determined by the Fisher exact
test.

Xenograft tumor model
Ten week-old athymic nude (NU/NU) mice (Harlan
Laboratories) were used in this experiment. All procedures
were performed in accordance with the guidelines set by
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the
