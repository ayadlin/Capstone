Protection from Rapamycin-Induced Apoptosis by
Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I Is Partially Dependent
on Protein Kinase C Signaling
Kuntebommanahalli N. Thimmaiah1, John B. Easton1, and Peter J. Houghton2

Abstract
Rapamycin-induced apoptosis in sarcoma cells is inhibited by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) through
a signaling pathway independent of Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Akt. IGF-I induces Bad
phosphorylation (Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155) in a pathway involving phosphoinositide 3′ kinase (PI3K) and
protein kinase C (PKC; μ, ε, or θ) resulting in sequestering Bad from mitochondria and subsequently interacting with 14-3-3γ in the cytosol. Gene knockdown of Bad, Bid, Akt1, Akt2, PKC-μ, PKC-ε, or PKC-θ was
achieved by transient transfection using small interfering RNAs. Results indicate that IGF-I signaling to Bad
requires activation of PI3K and PKC (μ, θ, ε) but not mTOR, Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2,
protein kinase A, or p90RSK. Wortmannin blocked the phosphorylation of PKC-μ (Ser744/Ser748), suggesting
that PI3K is required for the activation of PKCs. PKCs phosphorylate Bad under in vitro conditions, and the
association of phosphorylated Bad with PKC-μ or PKC-ε, as shown by immunoprecipitation, indicated direct
involvement of PKCs in Bad phosphorylation. To confirm these results, cells overexpressing pEGFP-N1, wtBad, or Bad with a single site mutated (Ser112Ala; Ser136Ala; Ser155Ala), two sites mutated (Ser112/136Ala;
Ser112/155Ala; Ser136/155Ala), or the triple mutant were tested. IGF-I protected completely against rapamycin-induced apoptosis in cells overexpressing wt-Bad and mutants having either one or two sites of phosphorylation mutated. Knockdown of Bid using small interfering RNA showed that Bid is not required for
rapamycin-induced cell death. Collectively, these data suggest that IGF-I–induced phosphorylation of Bad
at multiple sites via a pathway involving PI3K and PKCs is important for protecting sarcoma cells from
rapamycin-induced apoptosis. Cancer Res; 70(5); 2000–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The BH3-only protein Bad is unique, because its functions are tightly regulated by serine phosphorylation (1, 2).
In the hypophosphorylated form, Bad interacts with either
Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL to neutralize their antiapoptotic functions,
and this neutralization is believed to account for its proapoptotic functions. Inactive Bad is highly phosphorylated by
survival signals and binds to 14-3-3 scaffold proteins and
thus cannot interact with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (2, 3). Five phosphorylation sites have been reported for Bad. Phosphorylation at Ser112 and Ser136 is involved in 14-3-3 binding (4).
Published results reveal that phosphorylation of Ser136 is accomplished predominantly by Akt or p70S6 kinase (5, 6),

whereas mitochondrially localized protein kinase A,
Rsk, and Pak1 have all been shown to phosphorylate
Ser112 (7–10). Ser170 is another site that is phosphorylated
in cytokine-dependent cell survival (11). Recent reports
indicate that Ser128 is phosphorylated by cdc2 during induction of apoptosis in cerebellar granular neurons. Phosphorylation of Ser128 has also been implicated in dissociation of
Bad from 14-3-3 (12).
Recently, it has been shown that phosphorylation of Bad at
Thr201 by JNK1 promotes glycolysis through activation of
phosphofructokinase-1 (13). There is growing information
in the literature that the BH3-only protein plays an essential
role in cytokine deprivation–induced apoptosis in mast cells
(5). BH3-only members may initiate apoptosis by directly
binding to the essential cell death mediators Bax and Bak.
Alternatively, they can act by engaging their prosurvival
Bcl-2–like relatives (14). In one study, phosphorylation at
Ser136 and association with 14-3-3 was found to be essential
for its growth-promoting effect (15), whereas, in the other
study, only association with Bcl-XL was shown to be required,
independent of the phosphorylation state of Bad (16).
Mammalian isoforms of 14-3-3 bind and modify the functions of a wide variety of critical signaling molecules. One
function of 14-3-3 is to promote cell survival, as inhibition
of apoptosis results from the binding of many 14-3-3 ligands,

PKC Phosphorylation of Bad and Rapamycin-Induced Death

including Bad, ASK1, and forkhead transcription factors (17).
14-3-3 forms a very stable complex with phosphorylated Bad
and plays a significant role in the regulation of Bad function.
Rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling,
causes G1-phase accumulation and, under growth factor–
deficient conditions, p53-independent apoptosis. We have
shown that rapamycin-induced apoptosis is prevented by
exogenous insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) through a
signaling pathway independent of Ras-extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt (18) and that combining rapamycin with an antibody that blocks ligand binding to
IGF-IR is synergistic against most sarcoma xenograft tumor
models (19). Our initial observation that overexpression of
Bcl-2 significantly protects cells from rapamycin-induced apoptosis stimulated us to extend both pharmacologic and genetic studies to explore whether phosphorylation of Bad is
involved in IGF-I–mediated rescue.

Materials and Methods
Inhibitors. Rapamycin, wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059,
calphostin-C, chelerythrine chloride, KT5720, forskolin, and
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were dissolved in
DMSO before being added to culture medium (final concentration 0.1%).
Cell lines and growth conditions. The human cell lines
Rh1 and Rh30 have been described (20) and were grown
in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For serum-free experiments, cells
were cultured in modified MN2E medium as described
previously (20).
ApoAlert assay. We used the ApoAlert Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis kit (Clontech) as described previously (20).
Western blot analysis. Immunoblotting methods were as
described previously (20) with minor modifications. The
secondary antibody was either horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Immunoreactive
protein was visualized by using Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent.
Protein kinase C kinase assay. Rh1 cells grown in MN2E
were exposed to 0.1% DMSO or calphostin-C (1.2 μmol/L)
for 2 h and then stimulated with IGF-I (10 ng/mL) or PMA
(1 μmol/L) for 30 min. We then used the protein kinase C
(PKC) assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the
manufacturer's instructions to analyze the amount of activated PKC (α, βII, and γ and ε, θ, λ, μ, δ, and ζ). The amount of
incorporated radioactivity into the substrate was determined
by scintillation counting. To calculate the actual PKC activity, background radioactivity associated with control IgG antibody immunoprecipitated samples was subtracted. The
kinase assay was repeated three times.
Plasmids and transfection. The control vector pEGFP-N1
and the test plasmids, pEGFP-Bad (wild-type), or the
same construct with a single mutation (Ser112Ala; Ser136Ala;
Ser155Ala), double mutations (Ser112/136Ala; Ser112/155Ala;
Ser136/155Ala), and pEGFP-Bad (triple mutant; all three serine

sites mutated to alanine) used for this study have been described previously (21). Cells were transfected using the FuGENE6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable
expression of single or double mutants of Bad was confirmed
by Western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies
(data not shown).
Small interfering RNA experiments. Cells growing in
McCoy's 5A medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) control, siBad, siBid, siPKC-μ, siPKC-ε, siPKC-θ, siAkt1, or siAkt2 using
Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were then incubated at 37°C for
72 h, and the levels of protein expression of Bad, Bid, PKCμ, PKC-ε, PKC-θ, Akt1, or Akt2 were analyzed by Western
blot using their respective antibodies.
Binding of Bad to 14-3-3. Rh1, Rh1/GFP-Bad (wild-type),
or Rh1/GFP-Bad (triple mutant) cells cultured in MN2E medium were stimulated with IGF-I or PMA for 30 min and
lysed in 500 μL M-PER buffer as described previously and immunoprecipitated using Protein A/G Plus agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates of Bad were immunoblotted with the
antibodies developed against anti–14-3-3 (σ, γ, β, ε, θ, η,
and ζ).

Results
Effect of growth factors on the phosphorylation of Bad.
Because phosphorylation is critical for Bad inactivation (1, 2,
22–26), we first investigated whether IGF-I (10 ng/mL), insulin (250 ng/mL), epidermal growth factor (EGF; 25 ng/mL), or
platelet-derived growth factor (25 ng/mL) results in phosphorylation of Bad in Rh1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, phosphorylation of Bad reached the maximum at 30 min after
Rh1 cells were stimulated with either IGF-I or EGF. Phosphorylated Bad-specific antibodies to Ser136 and Ser155 were
not sensitive enough for detecting endogenous Bad phosphorylation. Consequently, we examined the effect of these
factors in Rh1 cells engineered to overexpress Bad (Rh1/
GFP-Bad). As shown in Fig. 1B, EGF stimulation led to a transient phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112 and Ser155. In contrast,
IGF-I stimulation resulted in prolonged phosphorylation at
each site (Fig. 1C). Similar kinetics for Bad phosphorylation
was observed in Rh30 cells stimulated with IGF-I (data not
shown). These results show that IGF-I or EGF treatment results in different patterns of Bad phosphorylation at multiple
sites.
IGF-I or EGF stimulation of Bad phosphorylation is via
phosphoinositide 3′ kinase but not ERK1/2, mTOR, or protein kinase A. We (18) and others (27–31) have shown that
phosphoinositide 3′ kinase (PI3K) mediates IGF-I–mediated
antiapoptotic signals. To determine whether PI3K or ERK1/2
signaling was required for phosphorylation of each Bad site,
Rh1/GFP-Bad cells were exposed to wortmannin (0.9 μmol/L)
or the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (30 μmol/L) before stimulation with IGF-I (Fig. 2A) or EGF (Fig. 2B). Wortmannin attenuated the IGF-I– or EGF–induced phosphorylation of Bad
at each site, whereas inhibition of MEK1/2 did not. PD98059
did inhibit the IGF-I– and EGF–dependent activation of
p90 RSK as determined by a block in phosphorylation of

Thr573 and Ser380 within the protein. The PKC inhibitor calphostin-C also failed to inhibit p90RSK phosphorylation in response to EGF or IGF-I treatment, indicating that PKCs may
not be required for the activation of p90RSK (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). To further determine if ERK1/2 was important for
IGF-I–dependent phosphorylation of Bad, a dominant-negative form of Ras (Ras N17) was expressed, which completely
inhibited Ras activation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by IGF-I or EGF (18). Ras N17 failed to suppress phosphorylation of Bad (Ser 1 1 2 ) after IGF-I stimulation
(Supplementary Fig. S1B).
In addition, IGF-I–induced phosphorylation of Bad
(Ser112) was not inhibited by rapamycin (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). Further, activation of protein kinase A with forskolin, as measured by phosphorylation of CREB (inhibited
by the protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720), does not result
in a phosphorylation of Bad (Supplementary Fig. S1D). This
result excludes protein kinase A in the IGF-I–mediated
phosphorylation of Bad.
To further elucidate the role of Akt in Bad phosphorylation, Akt1 and Akt2 were silenced using siRNA specific for
Akt1 or Akt2. siRNA greatly suppressed expression of Akt1
and Akt2 (Fig. 2C). However, phosphorylation of Bad
(Ser 112 ) induced by IGF-I was not abrogated (Fig. 2D).
Further, infection of Rh1 or Rh30 cells with “empty”
replication-defective adenovirus (lacking the E1 and E3 regions), which results in massive activation of both PI3K/
Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways consistent with published data (32), failed to induce phosphorylation of Bad (Ser112; Supplementary Fig. S2).
IGF-I activates PKC (μ, θ, or ε) via PI3K. To determine
the possible involvement of different isoforms of PKC in
IGF-I signaling, Rh1 cells were preincubated in MN2E medium with 0.1% DMSO or 1.2 μmol/L calphostin-C for 2
h before they were stimulated with IGF-I or the PKC activator PMA (1 μmol/L) for 30 min. Cell lysates were then
immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for PKC-α,
PKC-βII, PKC-γ, PKC-δ, PKC-ε, PKC-θ, PKC-μ, PKC-λ, or
PKC-ζ, and the resulting kinase activity of the immunocomplex was determined by measuring 32P phosphate transfer
from ATP to peptide substrates. IGF-I treatment resulted
in a significant increase in the activity of only PKC-μ,
PKC-θ, and PKC-ε (Fig. 3A). PMA was used as a positive
control for PKC activation. Further, as shown in Fig. 3A, activation of the three isoforms of PKC by IGF-I or PMA was
effectively blocked by calphostin-C.
Wortmannin inhibited the IGF-I–induced phosphorylation
of PKC-μ at Ser744/Ser748 but not PMA-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), indicating that PI3K plays an important
role in IGF-I–mediated activation of PKC in Rh1 cells. To
more directly assess the role of PKC in mediating Bad phosphorylation (10, 11, 33, 34), Rh1 cells grown in MN2E medium
were exposed to potent inhibitors of PKC, calphostin-C
(1.2 μmol/L), or chelerythrine chloride (3.5 μmol/L) for 2 h
before stimulating with IGF-I for 30 min (Fig. 3C). Both calphostin-C and chelerythrine chloride suppressed IGF-I stimulation of Bad (Ser112) phosphorylation but failed to block
phosphorylation of Akt. PMA-induced phosphorylation of

Figure 1. IGF-I induces sustained phosphorylation of Bad, while EGF
induces transient phosphorylation of Bad. Cells grown in MN2E medium
were stimulated with IGF-I (10 ng/mL) or EGF (25 ng/mL) for different
times. Phosphorylated Bad (Ser112, Ser136, or Ser155) was detected using
phosphospecific antibodies. Identical results were obtained in at least
three independent experiments. A, Rh1 cells. B and C, Rh1/GFP-Bad
(wild-type) cells.

Bad at Ser112 in Rh1 cells (10) is also blocked by treatment
with chelerythrine chloride (Fig. 3C). To test whether phosphorylation of Bad at other sites was PKC dependent, Rh1/
GFP-Bad cells grown in MN2E medium were exposed to calphostin-C for 2 h before stimulating with IGF-I for 30 min.
Immunoblotting revealed that calphostin-C blocked IGF-I–
induced Bad phosphorylation at each site (Fig. 3D).
The simultaneous knockdown of genes for these three PKC
isoforms using siRNAs resulted in severe toxicity to cells.
However, individual knockdown of PKC-μ, PKC-ε, or PKC-θ
by means of siRNAs failed to inhibit the phosphorylation of
Bad at Ser112, suggesting that the remaining PKC isoforms
may be compensating for knockdown of an individual isoform (Supplementary Fig. S3).

PKC Phosphorylation of Bad and Rapamycin-Induced Death

were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKC-μ, PKC-ε, or antiBad antibodies and immunoblotted. The results show coimmunoprecipitation of PKC-μ or PKC-ε with Bad in Rh1 cells
and provide evidence that there is a direct physical association (Fig. 4A).
Active PKC (μ, θ, or ε) can directly phosphorylate endogenous Bad at Ser112. To determine whether PKC can directly
phosphorylate endogenous Bad, the lysates from serumstarved Rh1 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Bad
antibody and incubated with purified recombinant active
PKC-μ, PKC-θ, or PKC-ε enzyme in a kinase buffer containing ATP (200 μmol/L). The samples were resolved and immunoblotted for phosphorylated Bad at Ser 1 1 2 using
phosphospecific antibody. IGF-I–stimulated phosphorylated
Bad was used as a positive control. Results indicate that active PKC isoforms directly phosphorylate Bad at Ser 112
(Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that PKC is a probable candidate for being the direct Bad kinase. Additional experiments were conducted to ascertain whether recombinant
active PKC phosphorylates recombinant Bad. Recombinant
Bad protein conjugated to agarose beads was incubated with
purified active PKC-μ, PKC-θ, or PKC-ε for 30 min in an
in vitro kinase assay. Phosphorylation of Bad was detected
using phosphospecific antibodies to Ser112, Ser136, or Ser155.
As shown in Fig. 4C, recombinant PKC-μ can directly phos-

phorylate recombinant Bad protein at all the three sites,
whereas the activity of PKC-θ or PKC-ε was weak against
Ser155 and not detected against Ser136.
IGF-I stimulates the binding of Bad to 14-3-3γ under apoptotic conditions. We tested the interaction of Bad with
seven different 14-3-3 isoforms (35). Immunoblotting with
antibodies specific for particular isoforms of 14-3-3 (α, β,
γ, θ, η, ζ, or ε) showed that both γ and θ isoforms were expressed at high levels. We hypothesized that, under apoptotic
conditions induced by rapamycin treatment, Bad would not
be associated with 14-3-3γ but that the protective effects of
IGF-I would stimulate binding. To test this hypothesis, Rh1
cells grown in MN2E medium were exposed to 0.1% DMSO or
rapamycin (100 ng/mL) in the absence or presence of IGF-I
continuously for 5 days. Lysates were prepared, and Bad was
immunoprecipitated using anti-Bad antibody, resolved by
SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using anti–14-3-3γ antibody.
As shown in Fig. 4D, very little association of Bad with 14-33γ was seen in control cells or in the presence of rapamycin
(apoptotic conditions). In contrast, treatment with IGF-I, in
the absence or presence of rapamycin, resulted in a marked
increase in Bad complexed with 14-3-3γ. These findings suggest a possible mechanism by which IGF-I protects the cells
from apoptosis induced by rapamycin through inducing
binding of Bad to 14-3-3γ.

wortmannin and PD98059 for 2 h and stimulated with IGF-I for 30 min. Blots were probed with Bad phosphospecific antibodies. B, Rh1/GFP-Bad cells
were treated as in A but stimulated with EGF. C, Rh1 cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA pools specific for Akt1 (left) or Akt2 (right).
Transfected cells grown in MN2E medium were either stimulated with IGF-I or not treated. Levels of Akt1 and Akt2 were determined by immunoblotting.
Actin was used as control. D, Rh1 cells were transfected and treated as in C. The levels of Bad (Ser112) were detected by immunoblotting.

To determine whether PMA-induced phosphorylated Bad
(Ser112) binds to 14-3-3 proteins, Rh1 cells cultured in
MN2E medium were stimulated with IGF-I or 1 μmol/L
PMA for 30 min, and samples were processed as before.
14-3-3γ coimmunoprecipitated with Bad in cells stimulated
with either IGF-I or PMA but not from the nonstimulated
control cells (Fig. 4D).
Bad phosphorylation at any site (Ser112, Ser136, and
Ser155) facilitates IGF-I rescue from rapamycin-induced
apoptosis. To address the role of Bad phosphorylation in
antiapoptotic signaling, we tested the survival effect of
IGF-I in rapamycin-treated Rh1 cells that were engineered
to stably express pEGFP-N1 (vector control), wild-type
GFP-Bad, single and double phosphorylation site mutants,

and the triple mutant containing amino acid substitutions
Ser112Ala, Ser136Ala, and Ser155Ala. In preliminary experiments, we determined that Rh1/GFP-Bad (wild-type) or
Rh1/GFP-Bad (triple mutant) could be stably expressed in
Rh1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A), and calphostin-C
blocked IGF-I–induced phosphorylation of Bad at each site
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). As anticipated, no phosphorylation was detected in the Bad mutant where all three sites
were mutated to alanine (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Overexpressed wild-type Bad bound 14-3-3γ, whereas the triplemutant Bad failed to bind 14-3-3γ (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
The effect of rapamycin treatment on the viability of Rh1
cells expressing GFP-Bad (wild-type) or the Bad mutants was
compared with the effect on the viability of an empty vector

IGF-I or PMA for 30 min without or with calphostin-C for 2 h and immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific for PKC-μ, PKC-θ, and PKC-ε.
Immunocomplexes were then used to assay PKC activity. Activation of the three isoforms of PKC by IGF-I (mean ± SD): PKC-μ (2.76 ± 0.81; n = 3), PKC-θ
(3.31 ± 0.11; n = 3), and PKC-ε (1.82 ± 0.10; n = 3). B, Rh1 cells were grown under serum-free conditions and treated as described above. The levels
of phosphorylated PKC-μ (Ser744/Ser748) was determined in the presence and absence of PMA and wortmannin with or without IGF-I stimulation. C, Rh1
cells grown under serum-free conditions were exposed to calphostin-C or chelerythrine chloride for 2 h and stimulated with IGF-I or PMA for 30 min.
After blotting phosphospecific antibodies directed against Bad Ser112 and Akt Ser473 were used to probe the blot. Total Bad and β-tubulin were
used as controls. D, Rh1/GFP or Rh1/GFP-Bad (wild-type) cells grown in MN2E medium were incubated without or with calphostin-C for 2 h and then
stimulated with IGF-I for 30 min. Cell lysates were prepared followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Phosphospecific antibodies detected the
phosphorylated signals on GFP-Bad at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155 in IGF-I–treated Rh1/GFP-Bad (wild-type) cells. The blot was stripped and reprobed
with anti–β-tubulin antibody. Representative of at least three independent experiments.

PKC Phosphorylation of Bad and Rapamycin-Induced Death

Figure 4. PKC-μ and PKC-ε immunoprecipitate with Bad and phosphorylate endogenous or recombinant Bad inducing association with 14-3-3γ. A,
lysates from Rh1 cells were prepared after stimulation with IGF-I (30 min) or after no stimulation and immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for PKC-μ,
PKC-ε, or Bad. Immunoblots were probed with the anti-PKC or anti-Bad antibodies. B, endogenous Bad was immunoprecipitated from Rh1 cell
lysates that had been stimulated with IGF-I or not stimulated. Lysates were incubated with recombinant PKC isozymes without (control) or with addition
of ATP. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and immunoblots were probed with antibodies against phosphorylated Bad (Ser112) or
total Bad. IgG was used as a nonspecific control. C, recombinant active PKC-μ, PKC-ε, and PKC-θ phosphorylate recombinant Bad. Recombinant
Bad was incubated with active recombinant PKC isozymes in the absence (control) or presence of ATP. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE
electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The immunoblots were probed with antibodies against phosphorylated Bad (Ser112,
Ser136, and Ser155) or total Bad. The control reaction lacked ATP. The results were similar in at least three independent experiments. D, IGF-I stimulates the
binding of Bad to 14-3-3γ under conditions where rapamycin induces apoptosis. Rh1 cells were grown under serum-free conditions ± rapamycin and
± IGF-I for 5 days (left) or stimulated with PMA or IGF-I for 30 min (right). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Bad antibody. The precipitated
proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti–14-3-3γ antibody. Representative of three independent experiments.

GFP-expressing control cell line using the ApoAlert flow cytometric assay and presented in Table 1 (cells expressing
single, double, or triple mutants of Bad). Expression of Bad
wild-type and mutants was approximately similar (Supplementary Fig. S5). Consistent with our earlier findings, the apoptotic profile of Rh1 cells expressing pEGFP-N1 vector was
almost identical with those of parental Rh1 cells, with ∼25%
of the empty vector–expressing cells positive for both Annexin V and propidium iodide staining. IGF-I reduced this level
to ∼15% to 20%. Rapamycin treatment resulted in ∼60% of
control cells undergoing apoptosis, and addition of IGF-I resulted in almost complete protection from apoptosis. Similar
results were obtained in cells expressing single or double
Bad mutants, whereas IGF-I completely protected against

rapamycin-induced apoptosis. Expression of GFP-Bad (triple
mutant) in Rh1 cells decreased the overall viability to a significant extent resulting in ∼88% apoptosis under rapamycinfree culture conditions, and IGF-I could not reverse this effect
completely (apoptotic population of 50%). This rescue probably reflects IGF-I–mediated abrogation of endogenous Bad
function (∼40% of cells rescued). Rapamycin treatment resulted in ∼95% of cells being scored as apoptotic, and addition of IGF-I resulted in the reduction of this population to
∼76%, thus exhibiting only a marginal rescue effect. Taken
together, our experiments with ectopic overexpression of
phosphorylation-deficient Bad mutants indicate that Bad
phosphorylation at one of three serine residues is essential
for the antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I.

Knockdown of Bad results in a partial increase of cytoprotection from rapamycin-induced apoptosis. Our results
indicate that IGF-I can abrogate the proapoptotic activity of
Bad by inducing its phosphorylation at multiple sites in sarcoma cells. To test this, RNA interference was employed. Results show that siRNA can potently and specifically reduce
Bad expression by >95%, whereas the control siRNA had no
effect (Fig. 5A). To determine whether Bad is responsible for
rapamycin-induced apoptosis, we exposed Rh1/sicontrol
RNA or Rh1/siBad cells to rapamycin for 4 days in the presence or absence of IGF-I and determined the extent of apoptosis within each treatment population. Analysis of the

results (Table 1; Fig. 5B) revealed that, in Rh1/sicontrol cells,
rapamycin increased apoptosis by 31%, whereas, in Bad-deficient cells, rapamycin increased apoptosis by only 16%. In
both conditions, coincubation with IGF-I almost completely
protected the cells. Thus, ∼50% of the apoptosis induced by
rapamycin appears to be mediated through Bad.

Discussion
The specific objectives of the present study were to determine whether Bad phosphorylation is required for IGF-I rescue of Rh1 cells from rapamycin-induced apoptosis and to

PKC Phosphorylation of Bad and Rapamycin-Induced Death

Figure 5. Downregulation of Bad protects cells from rapamycin-induced apoptosis. A, Rh1 cells were transfected with siRNA pools against Bad or control
RNAi. Cells were grown for an additional 2 days, and levels of Bad were determined by immunoblotting. B, Rh1 cells transfected with control or Bad
siRNA were grown in MN2E medium without treatment (control) or with IGF-I, rapamycin, or both reagents. Apoptosis was determined using the ApoAlert
assay after 4 days of treatment. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.

define the IGF-I–Bad signaling pathway. We have dissected
the signaling events leading to Bad phosphorylation at individual sites (Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155), and our results indicate that, in response to IGF-I or EGF, endogenous Bad is
phosphorylated at Ser112 but not significantly at Ser136 or
Ser155 in Rh1 and Rh30 cells as evidenced by the failure to
detect the phosphorylation sites of endogenous Bad at
Ser136 and Ser155 by available phosphospecific antibodies,
consistent with a previous report (36). In Rh1 cells, EGF induces only transient phosphorylation of Bad (Ser112) and
does not afford protection from rapamycin-induced apoptosis, whereas IGF-I stimulation leads to prolonged Bad (Ser112)
phosphorylation and protection from apoptosis.
The observations that PI3K inhibitors blocked the IGF-I–
induced phosphorylation of Bad show that PI3K mediates
IGF-I receptor-Bad signaling pathway, although phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) is not necessary for Bad phosphorylation.
Endogenous Akt3 expression in Rh1 cells is not detectable by
Western blot analysis. Infection of cells with replicationdefective adenovirus resulted in a massive phosphorylation
of Akt (Ser473) without phosphorylation of Bad. These data
appear to confirm that Akt signaling is not involved in the
Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 for this cell type.
IGF-I stimulation of PKC-μ phosphorylation was inhibited
by wortmannin placing PI3K upstream of PKCs in the IGF-I
signaling cascade. We focused on the potential role of PKCs
in IGF-I–dependent phosphorylation of Bad. PMA-induced or
IGF-I–induced phosphorylation of Bad on Ser112 was drastically inhibited by calphostin-C or chelerythrine chloride, confirming that Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 is PKC dependent.
In vitro kinase assays using recombinant active PKC (μ, θ,
and ε) enzymes furnished direct evidence for the phosphorylation of both endogenous and recombinant Bad at Ser112,

Ser136, or Ser155. We found that, of the three isoforms of PKC
examined, only the recombinant active PKC-μ enzyme phosphorylates all three sites of recombinant Bad, whereas PKC-θ
or PKC-ε enzyme targets predominantly Ser112 and, to a lesser extent, Ser155 and showed no activity against Ser136 on recombinant Bad. All three isoforms of recombinant active
PKC enzymes phosphorylated endogenous Bad from Rh1
cells at Ser112. We also observed a direct interaction between
PKC-μ or PKC-ε and Bad as evidenced by immunoprecipitation, suggesting that PKC-μ or PKC-ε may be a physiologic
Bad kinase. Simultaneous silencing of PKC-μ, PKC-ε, and
PKC-θ resulted in severe toxicity to Rh1 cells, but the individual knockdown of PKC-μ, PKC-ε, or PKC-θ by siRNA failed to
inhibit the phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112, suggesting that
PKC-μ, PKC-ε, and PKC-θ isoforms may be able to compensate for one another.
Our findings that calphostin-C failed to block the IGF-I–
induced phosphorylation of p90 RSK but did block Bad
phosphorylation suggest that p90RSK is not involved in this
PKC-mediated pathway. Similarly, pharmacologic and genetic evidence suggest that ERK1/2, protein kinase A, and
mTOR are also not involved in IGF-I–dependent phosphorylation of Bad.
In Rh1 cells, only 14-3-3γ was found to bind phosphorylated Bad following IGF-I stimulation. Further, our observation
that IGF-I stimulates the interaction between 14-3-3γ and
phosphorylated Bad under conditions where IGF-I protects
against rapamycin-induced apoptosis supports a possible
role for this interaction in mediating the protective effects
of IGF-I. To test the hypothesis that interaction of Bad with
14-3-3γ was required for IGF-I–mediated cell rescue, we used
a genetic approach. Either wild-type or phosphorylationdefective GFP-Bad (triple mutant) in which Ala residues were

substituted for regulatory serines was expressed in Rh1 cells.
Mutation of all the three serine residues in Bad to alanine
abrogated its ability to be phosphorylated in response to
IGF-I and completely abolished its binding with 14-3-3γ.
The results of the apoptosis assays reveal Bad as a major
player in rapamycin-induced cell death and that IGF-I–
mediated protection correlates well with phosphorylation
and sequestration of Bad. In Rh1 cells stably expressing control vector, single or double mutants of Bad or Bad (wildtype) cells undergo apoptosis to an extent of ∼25% to 50%
in serum-free medium. However, addition of IGF-I resulted
in essentially complete protection. These results support
the contention that Bad inactivation can be effected through
phosphorylation of any one of the three regulatory serines.
Expression of Bad (triple mutant) offered the opportunity
to determine the contribution played by Bad, as opposed
to other proapoptotic molecules, in rapamycin-induced apoptosis. The viability of Bad (triple mutant) cells was reduced
to a significant extent, and the apoptotic population increased to ∼88% under serum-free conditions. In contrast
to the phosphorylation-competent mutants of Bad, IGF-I
failed to protect Bad (triple mutant) cells completely. IGF-I
reduced the apoptotic population from ∼88% to 50%. This
modest rescue probably is due to IGF-I inducing phosphorylation and inactivation of endogenous Bad but not altering
the proapoptotic activity of the triple mutant. Rapamycin
treatment increased the apoptotic population from ∼88%
to ∼95%, and IGF-I reduced this to ∼76%, suggesting that
it rescued the component contributed by the endogenous
Bad but not that contributed by the phosphorylation-defective mutant. However, apoptosis contributed by the triple
mutant makes analysis of the contribution of mutant and
wild-type Bad difficult.
To better understand the effect of rapamycin alone, Bad was
silenced in Rh1 cells using siRNA. Rapamycin increased apoptosis by 31% in the siRNA control cells, whereas it increased
apoptosis by only 16% in siBad cells. These results suggest that

Bad downregulation plays a significant role in protection from
rapamycin-induced apoptosis. However, addition of IGF-I to
siBad cells resulted in almost complete protection.
This may indicate that a small fraction of endogenous Bad
was still functional, or an alternative mechanism, other than
Bad phosphorylation, contributes to partial protection from
rapamycin-induced apoptosis. The apoptotic effect of rapamycin in Rh1 cells transfected with siRNA control, siBid with
or without IGF-I, was also assessed. The results reveal that
Bid (37) alone failed to play any role in the apoptosis caused
by rapamycin (data not shown).
In summary, we suggest that the increase in Bad phosphorylation through a PI3K/PKC-mediated pathway by
IGF-I may represent an important pathway for the cytoprotective effect of this growth factor. Thus, IGF-I–induced
phosphorylation of Bad by PKC and subsequent sequestration by14-3-3 proteins serves at least, in part, the mechanism
by which IGF-I protects Rh1 cells against rapamycin-induced
apoptosis and offers a potential mechanism by which smallmolecule BH3 domain inhibitors or inhibitors of PKC may be
valuable in changing the cellular response to rapamycin from
cytostasis under normal physiologic conditions where IGF-I
is present to apoptosis.
