Abstract:

Most BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) carry an activating
JAK2 mutation. Approximately 96% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) harbors
the V617F mutation in JAK2 exon 14, whereas the minority of JAK2 (V617F)negative subjects shows several mutations in exon 12. Other mutation events as
MPL, TET2, LNK, EZH2 have been described in chronic phase, while NF1, IDH1, IDH2,
ASX1, CBL and Ikaros in blast phase of MPN. The specific pathogenic implication
of these mutations is under investigation, but they may have a role in refinement
of diagnostic criteria and in development of new prognostic models. Several trials
with targeted therapy (JAK inhibitors) are ongoing mostly involving patients with
PMF, post-PV MF and post-essential thrombocythemia (ET) MF. Treatment with
ruxolitinib and TG101348 has shown clinically significant benefits, particularly
in improvement of splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms in MF patients.
On the other hand, JAK inhibitors have not thus far shown disease-modifying
activity therefore any other deduction on these new drugs seems premature.

Towards
molecular
understanding of MPN

Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)
include three main diseases that are polycythemia vera
(PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary
myelofibrosis (PMF) [1].
As illustrated in Figure 1, ET patients may slowly
progress to PV, especially those carrying the JAK2
(V617F) mutation [2, 3]. Furthermore, PV and ET have a
variable risk of transformation to secondary myelofibrosis
(post-PV and post-ET MF) [4, 5] and subsequently to
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [6]. Finally, AML may
occur directly from ET and PV without the intermediate
step of MF, in which case AML may lack JAK2 mutation
even if arising from JAK2-positive MPN [7]. Evolution to
post-PV and post-ET myelofibrosis occurs at a rate of 10%
to 20% after 15 to 20 years of follow-up [5]. Progression
to AML is less frequent in PV and ET (2-7%) than in PMF
(8-30%) [2, 8-10].

The as yet unfinished story of MPN pathogenesis
started with the discovery of the JAK2 (V617F)
mutation;[11] afterwards many other mutations have
been found in chronic (exon 12 mutations of JAK2, MPL,
TET2, LNK, EZH2) and blast phase (NF1, IDH1, IDH2,
ASXL1, CBL, Ikaros ) of MPN, some involving JAKSTAT signaling activation, others chromatin remodeling
and others leukemic transformation. Mutations with
a gain of function of JAK2, MPL, CBL and those with
a loss of function of LNK and NF1 activate the JAKSTAT pathway[12] leading to a final phenotype of MPN
with alteration of immune response, inflammation,
angiogenesis, proliferation and resistance to apoptosis
(Figure 2). This pathway is the target of new JAK2
inhibitors.

of JAK2, MPL and CBL (due to gain of function) and mutations
of LNK and NF1 (due to loss of function) activate STAT3/5
which, through nuclear signal transduction, determines an
amplification of immune response, inflammation, angiogenesis
and proliferation, mostly modulated by higher circulating
cytokines levels. STAT3/5 activation also confers resistance
to apoptosis which promotes and supports myeloid precursor
proliferation.

Hemorrhage

Figure 1: Natural history of myeloproliferative
neoplasms. Most frequent clinical complications in MPN

patients are thrombosis, whereas hemorrhage is above all
observed in essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients. ET may
slowly develop into polycythemia vera (PV), especially if it
carries the JAK2 (V617F) mutation. PV and ET may progress
to myelofibrosis (post-ET, post-PV MF) and then turn into acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), although they may evolve into AML
even without showing a MF phase.

highlighting the cross talking with the Ras–ERK signaling
pathway. Compared with JAK2 (V617F)-positive PV
patients, those with exon 12 mutations had significantly
higher hemoglobin level and lower platelet and leukocyte
counts at diagnosis but similar incidences of thrombosis,
myelofibrosis, leukemia, and death [18].

Mutations mainly found during chronic phase of
MPN

MPL mutations
The MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia virus)
gene, located on 1p34, can comprise different mutations
within exon 10 targeting the transmembrane domain of
MPL receptor [19]. The parent of these mutations is the
W515L, resulting in constitutive activation of the JAK/
STAT pathway. Mutation frequency is estimated at 3-5%
for ET and 8-10% for PMF.[20, 21] In W515L-murine
models, the mutation confers a PMF-like phenotype with
thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, and fibrosis. In some
instances MPL mutations and JAK2 (V617F) coexist as
two independent clones or two subclones [20], revealing
the genetic complexity of MPN.

JAK2 (V617F)
JAK2 (V617F) mutation (Janus kinase 2), occurring
within exon 14 of JAK2 and located on 9p24 is the most
frequent mutation in MPN, ranging from roughly 96% in
PV to 65% in ET and PMF.[11, 13] This mutation affects
the auto-inhibitory domain (JH2, pseudokinase) of JAK2
leading to constitutive activation of JAK2 and JAK/STAT
signaling. In retroviral mouse models JAK2 (V617F)
confers a PV-like phenotype with a final evolution to
MF,[14] whereas when modulating allele burden, lower
mutant load generates thrombocythemia and higher
mutant burden results in polycythemia [15]. This means
that an increased signaling through JAK2 (V617F) may
be responsible for a PV phenotype, as demonstrated in
patients [13]. Clinical phenotype does not depend only on
allele burden, in fact, downstream of JAK2, an enhanced
phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT5 may promote
megakaryopoiesis or erythropoiesis [16].

TET2 mutations
TET2 (ten eleven translocation), a putative tumor
suppressor gene located on 4q24, can be affected by an
array of frameshift, nonsense and missense mutations [22,
23]. Experiments with NOD–SCID mice suggest that TET2
might be involved in self-renewal pathways relevant to
hematopoietic transformation [23]. Hierarchically, TET2
mutations occur before or after the acquisition of JAK2
mutations or may be an independent event [24]. In a large
cohort of MPN patients, TET2 mutations were detected
in 16% of PV, 5% of ET, 17% of PMF, 14% of post-PV
MF, 14% of post-ET MF and 17% of blast phase MPN;
but TET2 mutations are also described in other myeloid
malignancies such as myelodisplastic syndromes (MDS),
MPN/MDS syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia with
variable, although not unequivocally defined, prognostic
impact.

JAK2 exon 12 mutations
JAK2 exon 12 mutations have been described in
JAK2 (V617F)-negative PV and cover less than 2% of PV
diagnoses [17]. Seventeen different mutations have been
described with N542-E543del, K539L, and E543-D544del
as the most frequent ones [18]. Exon 12 mutations result
in strong ligand-independent signaling through JAK2
as demonstrated by the high levels of phospho-JAK2
and also of phospho-ERK1 and phospho-ERK2 [17],

LNK mutations

on 20q11.1 and belongs to a family of three identified
members that encode poorly characterized proteins
regulating chromatin remodeling, enhancing transcription
of certain genes while repressing the transcription of
others.[35] Mutations, mainly frameshift and nonsense,
occur within exon 12. Both TET2 and ASXL1 alterations
lead to an increase in the program of self-renewal in MPN
progenitors through modifications of DNA and histone
regulation. Mutations within ASXL1 are found in 8% of
MPN, 11% of MDS, 43% of chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia, 7% of de novo AML, and 47% of secondary
AML [35].

LNK, located on 12q24.12, encodes for LNK, a
plasma membrane-adaptor protein whose functions
include inhibition of wild type and mutant JAK2
signaling [25]. In fact, LNK is a negative regulator of
thrombopoietin-mediated JAK2 activation. It’s intriguing
that LNK-deficient mice exhibit increased number of
megakaryocytes and erythrocyte progenitors, as well as an
expanded hematopoietic stem cell pool with enhanced self
renewal [26]. Loss of function mutations of LNK situated
within exon 2 have been described at low frequency in ET
and PMF, and in erythrocytosis with low erythropoietin
[27, 28].

CBL mutations

EZH2 mutations

The casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-CBL) gene is
located on 11q23.3. CBL is a well characterized protein
that plays both negative and positive regulatory roles in
tyrosine kinase signalling.[36, 37] CBL targets a variety
of activated tyrosine kinases for degradation and may
also serve as an adaptor by recruiting some downstream
transduction components. Mutations in this gene are more
frequent in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (17%)
than in MPN (6% in PMF) [38].

Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) located on
7q36.1 encodes the catalytic subunit of the polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a highly conserved histone
H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase that influences stem cell
renewal by epigenetic repression of genes involved in
apoptosis [29]. EZH2 has oncogenic activity. Different
mutations have been found in patients with myeloid
malignancies with a mutation frequency of 12% in MDS/
MPN and of 13% in MF [29].

IKAROS mutation
The transcription factor Ikaros encoded by the IKZF1
gene (7p12) has a role in the regulation of hematopoiesis.
In murine models, deficiency of Ikaros function may
induce lymphoproliferative disorders and B- and T-cell
leukemia, but also anemia and thrombocytopenia. In
MPN, hemizygous loss of IKZF1 was detected in 21% of
post-MPN leukemia and in 0.2% of chronic phase MPN
indicating oncogeneic properties of IKAROS defects
[39]. Post-MPN AML involving Ikaros may be due to the
genetic instability after Ikaros deletion or, alternatively,
by the recently documented interaction of Ikaros with the
JAK-STAT pathway.

Mutations mainly found outside chronic phase of
MPN
NF1 mutations
NF1 (neurofibromatosis-1) (17q11.2 ) is
associated with the hereditary von Recklinghausen’s
neurofibromatosis. It has been shown that these patients
have an increased risk of developing various tumors
including myeloid leukemia [30]. NF1 functions as
a negative regulator of the RAS signal transduction
pathway, cross-talking with the JAK-STAT pathway, and
loss of NF1 can lead to a progressive myeloproliferative
disorder. NF1 mutations were described in few patients
with post-ET and post-PV MF, while no patients with
chronic phase MPN carried these mutations [31].

Towards new targeted therapies
Many drugs are now under investigations targeting
different pathways critical for MPN development, such
as the JAK-STAT (JAK2-inhibitors: INCB018424,
TG101348, CEP701, CYT387, SB1518, AZD1480,
XL019, LY2784544), the mTOR (everolimus), the MAPK
(erlotinib), and the NF-Kb (bortezomib) pathways, or
act through remodeling chromatin with a key role in
epigenetics (givinostat, panobinostat, vorinostat). For
a best update on new trials, we advise to check www.
clinicaltrials.gov.
Most of JAK2 inhibitors are small molecules that act
by competing with ATP for the ATP-binding catalytic site in
the kinase domain. Preclinical studies have demonstrated
activity of these drugs by direct inhibition of interleukin-6
signaling and of proliferation of JAK2(V617F)-positive
Ba/F3 cells [40, 41]. In mouse models of JAK2 (V617F)-

IDH1 and IDH2 mutations
Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH 1 and IDH2)
are located at 2q33.3 and 15q26.1, respectively.[32] IDH1
mutated protein produces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG).
Although the role of 2-HG in tumor initiation and growth is
not fully understood, this putatively oncogenic metabolite
plays a role in MPN progression to leukemia besides the
well defined role in the pathogenesis of gliomas [33].The
frequency of these mutation in chronic MPN such as PV,
ET and PMF is under 5%, but it becomes 21% in postMPN AML [34].
ASXL1 mutations

endpoint was the number of subjects achieving ≥ 35%
reduction in spleen volume from baseline to week 24 for
COMFORT I and the number of subjects achieving ≥ 35%
reduction in spleen volume from baseline to week 48 for
COMFORT II. Media release has recently revealed that
both trials have met the primary endpoint.

MPN, JAK2 inhibitors markedly reduced splenomegaly
and preferentially eliminated neoplastic cells, resulting in
significantly prolonged survival of mice. While treatment
with a JAK2 kinase inhibitor ameliorates the MPN
phenotype, it does not eliminate the disease-initiating
clone [42].
Taking together all available clinical data on MPN,
one may conclude that JAK2 inhibitors give a benefit
to patients with MF, by reducing spleen size of ~ 50%
in approximately 40-50% of patients and by abolishing
symptoms in the vast majority of MF patients. However,
effect on these disease manifestations should be balanced
with the safety profile. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are
on-target toxicities expected with all JAK2 inhibitors.
Other toxicities may involve non-JAK2 targets, as in
case of gastrointestinal events during therapy with JAK2
inhibitors with off-target activity against FLT3 (CEP 701,
TG101348, SB1518). For the current paper, we decided to
report only data from the most promising JAK2 inhibitors,
such as INCB018424 and TG101348, whose results are
already available as full paper.

TG101348, SAR302503
A phase I trial with TG101348 (JAK2 inhibitor,
orally bioavailable) was conducted in 59 patients with
PMF or post-PV, post-ET MF [41]. Eligible subjects
were intermediate and high-risk patients unresponsive
to current treatments. Main exclusion criteria were
thrombocytopenia (PLT < 50 x109/L) and neutropenia
(ANC <1000 x109/L). The results available to date can
be summarized in the following points. First, maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) was 680 mg/day and dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT) was a reversible and asymptomatic increase
in the serum amylase level. Dose chosen for a phase II/
III trial was 400 mg or 500 mg daily. Second, applying
IWG-MRT criteria of response, 59% of patients achieved
CI of spleen size by palpation at 6 months. The majority
of patients with constitutional symptoms, fatigue, pruritus
had a durable resolution without a measurable effect on
cytokines. Across doses, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis
were normalized at 12 months in 57% and 90% of patients.
Third, no differences were reported in term of response
rate according to JAK2 (V617F) mutational status. Fourth,
39% of patients with more than 20% JAK2 (V617F)
allele burden at enrollment had a reduction of mutation
load exceeding 50% at 12 months. Fifth, grade 3 to 4
hematologic adverse events included anemia (occurring
in 35% of 37 patients who were not RBC transfusion
dependent at baseline), thrombocytopenia (24%) and
neutropenia (10%). At doses ranging between 240 mg
and 520 mg, 2 of 5 (40%) RBC transfusion-independent
patients became RBC transfusion-dependent and 2 of 9
(22%) had grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. The main nonhematologic adverse events included all grades nausea
(69%), diarrhea (64%) vomiting (58%), all self-limited
and controlled by symptomatic treatments. Asymptomatic
increase of lipase, AST, ALT, creatinine have been
reported in roughly one quarter of patients.

INCB18424, Ruxolitinib
A phase I/II trial with ruxolitinib (JAK1, JAK2
inhibitor, orally bioavailable) was conducted in 152
patients with PMF or post-PV/post-ET MF [40]. Eligible
subjects were therapy-requiring patients, refractory,
relapsed, intolerant to previous therapy, or patients with
intermediate or high-risk Lille score, if at diagnosis. Main
exclusion criteria were thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100
x109/L) and neutropenia (ANC <1500 x109/L). The results
available to date can be summarized in the following
points. First, 15 mg BID (10 mg BID if platelet count
<100 x109/L) was the best starting dose. Second, applying
IWG-MRT criteria, 44% of patients obtained a clinical
improvement (CI) of spleen size (≥50% reduction from
baseline) by palpation at 3 months and responses were
maintained at 12 months in more than 70% of patients.
The majority of patients had ≥50% improvement in
constitutional symptoms due to the activity against proinflammatory cytokines. Among red blood cell (RBC)
transfusion-dependent patients, 14% become RBC
transfusion-independent. Third, no differences were
reported in term of response rates according to disease type
(primary or secondary MF) or JAK2 (V617F) mutational
status. Fourth, non-hematologic toxicity occurred in less
than 6% of patients and was usually grade 2. At a dose
of 15 mg BID, grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred in
3% of patients and new onset of anemia in 8% of RBC
transfusion-independent patients. Thrombocytopenia was
more frequent if platelet count < 200 x109/L at treatment
start; however, this toxicity proved to be reversible.
Two randomized trials with ruxolitinib are ongoing
in MF patients: COMFORT I, randomizing ruxolitinib
versus placebo, and COMFORT II, randomizing
ruxolitinib versus best available therapy. The primary

Conclusion
The discovery of new oncogenetic mutations in MPN
has enriched our knowledge in these diseases resulting
in the refinement of diagnostic criteria and in potential
advantages in prognostication. JAK2 inhibitors can be
beneficial to patients with improvement of spleen size and
constitutional symptoms. For the time being, these are the
most relevant conclusions on these new small molecules
with anti-JAK2 properties and any other deduction seems
premature.
