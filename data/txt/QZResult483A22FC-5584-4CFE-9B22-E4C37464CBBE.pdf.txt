Abstract
Anorexia-cachexia syndrome (ACS) is a major determinant of cancer-related death that causes progressive
body weight loss due to depletion of skeletal muscle mass and body fat. Here, we report the development of a
novel preclinical murine model of ACS in which lymphomas harbor elevated Myc and activated mTOR
signaling. The ACS phenotype in this model correlated with deregulated expression of a number of cytokines,
including elevated levels of interleukin-10 which was under the direct translational control of mTOR. Notably,
pharmacologic intervention to impair protein synthesis restored cytokine production to near-normal levels,
delayed ACS progression, and extended host survival. Together, our ﬁndings suggest a new paradigm to treat
ACS by strategies which target protein synthesis to block the production of procachexic factors. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Anorexia-cachexia syndrome (ACS) is characterized by loss
of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle mass that leads to weight
loss exceeding 10% of the patient's preillness weight (1, 2). ACS
affects 80% of advanced patients with cancer and impacts on
the survival of patients, response to chemotherapy, and overall
quality of life—accounting for approximately 30% of cancerrelated deaths. The underlying mechanisms responsible for
ACS remains obscure, but are thought to be multifactorial,
resulting from an imbalance of pro- and anti-inﬂammatory
cytokines and orexigenic and anorexigenic factors (1). Altered
expression of several cytokines and growth factors (e.g., TNF-a,
IL-1, IL-6, IGF-1, and IFN-g) have been implicated in cancer
cachexia (3–8).
The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is one of the most frequently
perturbed signaling cascades in human cancers (9) and serves
to integrate extra- and intracellular inputs from a large number
of sources to ﬁne tune cellular proliferation and growth. One
key event downstream of mTOR regulated by this pathway is
the ribosome recruitment phase of translation initiation.

Ribosome recruitment is mediated by eukaryotic initiation
factor (eIF)4F, a complex consisting of eIF4E, the cap (m7GpppN;
where N is any nucleotide) binding protein; eIF4A, an RNA
helicase; and eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein (10). mTOR
regulates translation initiation rates by controlling the availability of eIF4E and eIF4A for assembly into the eIF4F complex
(10). Thus, loss of the tumor suppressors, PTEN, TSC1, or TSC2,
lead to activation of the mTOR kinase and elevated translation
initiation rates. Small molecules that target mTOR or eIF4F
reverse chemoresistance in preclinical cancer models (11, 12).
In the Em-Myc lymphoma model, where Myc overexpression
is driven by the lymphoid-speciﬁc IgH enhancer (Em) in the preB/B-cell compartment (13), lesions in the Akt-Tsc1/2 pathway
accelerate lymphomagenesis (11, 14). Here, we describe a new
murine model of ACS consisting of pre-B/B-lymphoma cells
overexpressing Myc and exhibiting activated mTOR signaling
due to loss of the PTEN, TSC1, or TSC2 tumor suppressor
genes. We take advantage of the powerful genetics of this
model to develop a new paradigm for treating ACS consisting
of targeting protein synthesis to curtail aberrant production of
procachexic factors.

Mouse studies
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc, Tsc1þ/Em-Myc, and Ptenþ/Em-Myc lymphomas were generated from crosses between Tsc2þ/,
Tsc1þ/, and Ptenþ/ to Em-Myc mice. All strains have been
inbred on the C57BL/6 (Charles River Laboratories) background for more than 10 generations. In the Em-Myc model,
disease is characterized by palpable lymph nodes, evidence of
circulating leukemic cells, and enlarged spleens (13).
For treatment studies, C57BL/6 males were injected
with 2 million Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1 cells. Rapamycin or

homoharringtonine treatments were initiated 3 and 5 days
following cell transplant, respectively, and continued every day
for the indicated times. A complete remission is deﬁned as the
absence of palpable tumor and leukemia. Tumor-free survival
is deﬁned as the time between treatment and reappearance of a
palpable lymphoma. Overall survival is deﬁned as the time
between treatment and progression to a terminal stage at
which point the animals were euthanized. The terminal stage is
deﬁned by the McGill University Faculty of Medicine Animal
Care Committee which uses the body condition score (BCS)
method (15). We used a BCS < 2 which includes decreased
exploratory behavior, reluctance to move (decreased locomotion/mobility), pronounced hunched posture, piloerection,
moderate to severe dehydration (sunken eyes, prolonged skin
tent, and lethargy), and unrelenting pain (e.g., distress vocalization). All animal studies were approved by the McGill
University Faculty of Medicine Animal Care Committee. Data
were analyzed in the Kaplan–Meier format using the log-rank
(Mantel–Cox) test for statistical signiﬁcance.
For the C26 colon cancer cachexia model, a tumor section
was obtained from the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,
MD, and surgically transplanted into the ﬂank of a 6 week-old
male BALB/c mouse. Two weeks after engraftment, cells were
extracted by mincing the tumor in PBS, followed by multiple
passages through syringes with decreasing size. Finally, the
resulting suspension was trypsinized by incubation with 0.25%
trypsin and grown in RPMI-1640 medium. Except for their
ability to induce cachexia, no further authentication was
carried out on the C26 cell line. For transplantation studies,
2  106 cells were resuspended in 100-mL PBS and injected
in the right ﬂank of 4- to 6-week-old male BALB/c mice.
Serum harvesting and cytokine proﬁling
For serum collection, mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (240 mg/kg) and blood harvested by heart puncture
with a 25 gauge needle and transferred to BD Microtainer
serum separator tubes (BD Biosciences). Serum was prepared
and cytokine determinations conducted on a Biorad Bio-Plex
reader which allows multiple cytokines to be proﬁled from
single samples. Leptin (Assay Design), CRP (Immunology
Consultants Laboratory, Inc.), acetylated ghrelin (SPI-Bio),
interleukin-10 (IL-10; eBioscience), and neuropeptide Y (NPY;
Peninsula Laboratories) levels were determined by ELISA
assays conducted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Serum levels of glucose were determined by the
glucose (GO) assay kit (Sigma).
Indirect calorimetric assay
Eight mice were individually subjected to indirect calorimetry (Columbus Instruments). Measurements on Tsc2þ/EmMyc and Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice were carried out for
2 weeks in a special experimental room with stable room
temperature and automatic light control (7–19 hours). Body
weight was recorded every day. The concentrations of input
and output oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) were detected by
built-in oxygen and CO2 sensors, respectively. The oxygen
consumption and CO2 production were deduced from the
difference between input and output values. The total energy

748

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

expenditure (heat production) and the respiratory exchange
ratio (RER) were calculated as described previously (16).
Because of changes in body weight, the average weight of 2
consecutive days was used to calculate the per-weight oxygen
and CO2 consumptions.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR
measurements
For monitoring muscle gene expression, RNA was prepared
from gastrocnemius muscles by solubilization in guanidium isothiocyanate followed by centrifugation on a CsCl cushion. cDNA
was prepared from the RNA using reverse transcriptase and
oligo (dT) as primer. Quantitative PCR was conducted on the
cDNA samples using primers listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Polysomal RNA isolation and qRT-PCR were carried out as
described (14). The primers used for qRT-PCR were: IL-10
forward (336–356), 50 -ACCTGGTAGAAGTGATGCCCC-30 ; IL10 reverse (553–572), 50 -CTATGCAGTTGATGAAGATG-30 ;
b-actin forward (822–844), 50 -TCACTATTGGCAACGAGCGGTT-30 ; and b-actin reverse (1,013–991), 50 -TGTCAGCAATGCCTGGGTACAT-30 .

Results
Mice bearing Em-Myc lymphomas harboring loss of the
PTEN or TSC1/2 tumor suppressors develop cardinal
features of ACS
During the course of tumor transplantation studies into
C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary Fig. S1A), we noted that
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc and Ptenþ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing animals
showed signiﬁcantly reduced survival times compared with
mice harboring Em-Myc tumors, despite having received the
same number of cells during transplant (Fig. 1A). The observed
decrease in survival was not due to increased tumor burden as
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc and Ptenþ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing animals
presented with smaller inguinal tumors (Supplementary Fig.
S1B), equivalent or reduced B220þ tumor cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1C), and reduced spleen weights (Supplementary Fig.
S1D). Notably, Tsc2þ/Em-Myc and Ptenþ/Em-Myc tumorbearing mice showed a rapid and severe loss of body weight
starting at 9 and 11 days, respectively, after transplantation
(Fig. 1B). This was in contrast to mice bearing Em-Myc lymphomas who continued to gain weight over the course of the
experiment at a rate comparable with wild-type C57BL/6 mice
(Fig. 1B). Mice bearing Tsc2þ/Em-Myc or Ptenþ/Em-Myc
lymphomas also showed complete loss of adipose tissue
(which occurred before the experimental endpoint; Fig. 1C)
as well as signiﬁcant loss of muscle mass (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1E). To determine the relative rates at which
muscle mass and adipose tissue were lost, a cohort of mice
were injected with either Tsc2þ/Em-Myc or Em-Myc tumor
cells and at speciﬁed times, animals were sacriﬁced and muscle
and adipose fat mass was measured. We found that muscle
mass and epididymal fat loss occurred concurrently indicating
that the reduction in muscle mass was not a secondary
consequence due to the absence of adipose tissue (Supplementary Fig. S2). Mice bearing tumor cells in which mTOR
signaling was not activated, such as Em-Myc or Em-Myc/Bcl-2

lymphomas, did not show this general "wasting" phenotype
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The muscle loss observed in
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing animals was attributable, at
least in part, to activation of intracellular proteolysis as
reﬂected by increased expression of key markers of the ubiquitin and autophagic systems (Fig. 1E). This included elevated
muscle expression of the ubiquitin protein ligases MuRF1 and
MAFbx/atrogin-1 (17, 18), the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19
(19), and the autophagy genes LC3b, Gabarap, Bnip3, and Atg4b
(20) in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice compared with
Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 1E) and indicate the presence of an active catabolic process in muscle of Tsc2þ/EmMyc tumor-bearing mice.
Mice harboring Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumors also have reduced
appetite compared with those bearing Em-Myc tumors (Fig. 2A).
To determine whether this reduced caloric intake could account
for the reduction in body mass noted among Tsc2þ/Em-Myc
tumor-bearing animals (Fig. 1B), we carried out a pair-wise
feeding experiment where mice bearing Em-Myc tumors had
either open access to food or restricted caloric intake equivalent
to that ingested by Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice (Fig.
2B). In this experiment, Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice in the pairwise feeding cohort gained weight for 6 days, then when tumors

than Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice. This contrasted to
mice bearing Tsc2þ/Em-Myc lymphomas who showed a dramatic weight loss upon appearance of palpable tumors (Fig. 2B).
These results indicate that the loss of body weight observed in
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice cannot simply be due to
reduced caloric intake.
The earliest manifestation of deregulated metabolism (after
day 7) in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice was a lowered
RER, indicating a greater reliance on fat metabolism, even
during the active nocturnal period (Fig. 2C). Given the low fat
content of mouse chow this strongly suggests that reserve fuels
in fat pads were being recruited (Fig. 2C). After day 12, the RER
started climbing again suggesting that given the poor general
condition and feeding of the animals at that time, amino acids
from proteins (i.e., muscle and other organs) became a principal source of fuel. Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice also
showed a pronounced decrease in oxygen consumption, CO2,
and heat production, upon onset of palpable tumors, consistent with their inability to maintain a normal level of energy
metabolism (Supplementary Fig. S4). This was also accompanied by a loss of the normal circadian variations in the level of
metabolism in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice.

Because TSC2 interacts with TSC1 to form a complex
that inhibits mTOR signaling, we also evaluated whether
Tsc1þ/Em-Myc tumors would also yield an ACS phenotype.
Tsc1þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice showed reduced survival
rates compared with Em-Myc tumor-bearing animals (data not
shown) and this was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in
body weight (Fig. 2D) and loss of epididymal fat pads (data not
shown). As documented for Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing
mice, Tsc1þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice had reduced appetite (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Tsc1þ/Em-Myc tumors showed
increased signaling ﬂux through mTOR, as evidenced by
increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP and rpS6 (Supplementary
Fig. S5B). Taken together, these results indicate that mice
bearing Em-Myc lymphomas with increased signaling ﬂux
through the Akt-mTOR axis, due to loss of Pten, Tsc1, or Tsc2
exhibit many features of ACS that are present in the human
condition.
IL-10 is elevated in mice bearing Tsc2þ/Em-Myc cells
and is translationally regulated by mTOR
Another signature of the ACS phenotype in humans is what
has been described as a "cytokine storm," the undesired
production of cytokines that lead to a general systemic inﬂam-

matory response (1). To gain insight into the mechanism(s)
driving ACS in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice, we quantitated serum levels of cytokines and known markers of
cachexia in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc and Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice
(Table 1). The results indicate an impressive deregulation of
cytokines and serum factors. We did not observe increases
in the levels of the "classical" cachexia mediators and markers
(e.g., IL-6, TNF-a, IFN-g, and IL-1) in this model (21) but rather
noted reduced levels of leptin and NPY and increased IL-10 and
IL-12(p40) levels (1, 22). Similar changes in the proﬁle of
leptin and IL-10 were observed in skeletal muscle tissue from
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice relative Em-Myc tumorbearing mice or control C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Because of the implication of IL-10 in human ACS (see Discussion), we characterized regulation of IL-10 expression in
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc cells-–focusing on translation as this is a
major gene regulatory pathway usurped in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc
cells (14).
First, to uncouple drug-based effects on tumor cell maintenance from effects on procachexic factor production, we transduced the prosurvival gene encoding Mcl-1 into Tsc2þ/EmMyc cells (Fig. 3A and B) to generate drug resistant Tsc2þ/EmMyc/Mcl-1 cells (7). Ex vivo, both Tsc2þ/Em-Myc and

Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1 cells produce higher levels of IL-10 than
Em-Myc cells (Fig. 3C). IL-10 production in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/
Mcl-1 cells was inhibited by rapamycin suggesting that it was
under mTOR translational control (Fig. 3D). To more directly
assess this, we isolated polysomes from rapamycin- and vehicle-treated Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1 cells (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S7) and quantitated the distribution of IL-10
mRNA across the fractions. Rapamycin signiﬁcantly reduced
IL-10 mRNA translation, as assessed by a shift in the bulk IL-10
mRNA population from heavy to lighter polysomes (Fig 3F).
This was an mRNA-selective effect as the distribution of
b-actin mRNA did not change (Fig. 3G) upon exposure to
rapamycin. These results show that IL-10 is a rapamycinresponsive mRNA whose translation is affected by signaling
ﬂux through the TSC1/2-mTOR pathway in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/
Mcl-1 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that both
muscle and Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor cells are sources of
increased IL-10 levels.
Inhibiting protein synthesis prolongs survival in ACS
We next rationalized that in vivo cytokine production could
be inhibited by targeting mTOR (i.e., rapamycin) signaling or

translation initiation (e.g., homoharringtonine), and that this
might dampen the cytokine storm to ameliorate the severity of
ACS in this model. To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst ensured
that Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1 cells were resistant to rapamycin
and homoharringtonine in vivo. Indeed, animals bearing
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1 cells do not respond to rapamycin or
homoharringtonine compared with the tumor-free survival
beneﬁt afforded by these compounds in mice harboring
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc cells (Fig. 4A). Sufﬁcient rapamycin and
homoharringtonine was delivered in vivo to impair mTOR
signaling protein synthesis in the tumor cell population, as
respectively illustrated by decreased phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and rpS6 (Supplementary Fig. S8A) and by the reduction
of polysomes by homoharringtonine (Supplementary Fig. S8B)
in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1 tumor cells. Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1
tumor-bearing mice rapidly lost weight upon appearance of
palpable tumors (Fig. 4B). Treatment of mice with rapamycin
or homoharringtonine prevented this loss (Fig. 4B), improved appetite (Fig. 4C), and diminished the severity of fat
loss (Fig. 4D), despite having little impact on the total tumor
cell population (Fig. 4E). Both homoharringtonine and rapamycin signiﬁcantly prolonged survival in mice bearing

Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1 tumors (Fig. 4F). As well, both rapamycin- and homoharringtonine-treated mice bearing
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1 tumors showed signiﬁcant improvements in the levels of several deregulated cytokines and
markers (IL-10, CRP, and IL-12p40), leptin, NPY, and glucose
(Supplementary Fig. S9). To determine whether these results
could be explained by a general drug-mediated effect on
muscle cell catabolism, we tested the ability of rapamycin
to prevent IFN-g/TNF-a–mediated muscle breakdown (23).
We found that rapamycin was ineffective in preventing IFN-g/
TNF-a–induced weight loss and muscle degeneration in this
model (Supplementary Fig. S10).
To extend these results and show they are not a peculiarity of
the Em-Myc model, we tested rapamycin and homoharringtonine in another model of cancer cachexia—the C26 colon
cancer model (Fig. 5A). This mouse model has been extensively
studied and the cachexic phenotype is determined predominantly by high levels of the proinﬂammatory cytokine IL-6 (24–

752

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

28), whose production is also under mTOR translational regulation (29). Treatment of C26 tumor-bearing mice with rapamycin, and to a lower extent homoharringtonine, also blunted
several features of cachexia in this model, including loss of
body weight (Fig. 5B), reduction in appetite (Fig. 5C), and the
severity of fat loss (Fig. 5D), despite having little impact on total
tumor weight (Fig. 5E). It is unclear why rapamycin is more
effective than homoharringtonine in this model, but this may
relate to mTOR contributing to the ACS phenotype in the C26
model through additional pathways that are translation
independent.

Discussion
Herein, we characterize a novel model of ACS which displays
many cardinal features of human ACS, including anorexia,
increased expression of catabolic markers in muscle, reduced
body weight, adipose tissue, muscle mass, total energy

expenditure, and survival. ACS is not a general feature of the
Em-Myc model as mice bearing Em-Myc or Em-Myc/Bcl-2
lymphomas do not show signs of ACS (Fig. 1, Supplementary
Figs. S2–S4). An important feature of our model is that the ACS
phenotype presents itself at an early stage after tumor cell
transplant before the tumor burden (lymphoma size, leukemic
burden, and spleen size) is sufﬁciently large to impact on
survival. This is exempliﬁed by the fact that mice bearing
Em-Myc tumor cells survive (Fig. 1A: 25 days) at least 2-fold
beyond the time of ﬁrst noticeable onset of ACS in Tsc2þ/EmMyc tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 1B: day 12). Hence our results
cannot be attributed to an overwhelming tumor burden.
Several features of the model that we present encompass
important components of human ACS and provide a powerful

genetic system for future studies as follows. (i) Our model
recapitulates tumor/host microenvironment by using immunocompetent animals. (ii) The Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing
model recapitulates deregulation of the appetite-controlling
leptin/NPY axis present in human ACS (30, 31). Reduced leptin
levels should increase NPY production to stimulate appetite,
but the opposite is observed in the anorexigenic state in
Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice and is consistent with
what has been reported for the human experience (reviewed in
ref. 1). (iii) In Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice, the onset of
anorexia is reproducible and consistent–-a feature that
is important when standardizing in vivo drug treatment
protocols. (iv) In addition, our model easily lends itself to
genetic manipulations as tumor cells can be expanded and

manipulated ex vivo, followed by transplantation experiments
(Fig. 3A). (v) An increase in energy expenditure is also associated with human ACS (1). In some situations, this is manifested as an elevation in resting energy expenditure, whereas
in others resting energy expenditure is increased whereas total
energy expenditure is reduced, presumably because of reduced
physical activity (1). Our model shows reduced total energy
expenditure (Supplementary Fig. S4C). (vi) Muscle mass was
also dramatically reduced in mice bearing Tsc2þ/Em-Myc
tumors and this coincided with activation of the ubiquitin
system. Activation of this system in muscle has been observed
in patients with cancer (32), suggesting that our model recapitulates this aspect of muscle wasting observed in human
ACS. We also found activation of genes in the autophagy
system which has recently been shown to be important in
muscle wasting (20). To our knowledge there are no reports
investigating the status of the autophagy system in human
ACS, but it is known to be activated in human diaphragm
muscle undergoing disuse atrophy (33).
We ﬁnd that IL-10 and IL-12(p40) levels are signiﬁcantly
elevated in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc tumor-bearing mice whereas
levels of IL-6, IL-1, TNF-a, and IFN-g remain unchanged or
are decreased (Table 1). Hence, the classical markers of
cachexia identiﬁed in other mouse models are not elevated
in the Tsc2þ/Em-Myc model. We characterized the mode of
regulation of IL-10 in our model because of several reports of
IL-10 dysregulation associated with human ACS. Shibata and

Tumors

colleagues (22) reported that IL-10 levels are elevated in
patients with cachexic colorectal cancer compared with levels
found in patients with colorectal cancer of all other stages. As
well, patients with pancreatic cancer having high IL-10 levels
show poorer overall survival than those with low IL-10 serum
levels (34). Importantly, IL-10 promoter polymorphisms (35–
37) are associated with elevated risk for cancer cachexia. How
these polymorphisms predispose to cachexic onset is not
known but one hypothesis could be that some lead to elevated
IL-10 expression in tumors arising in said individuals. Consistent with IL-10 playing a role in the ACS phenotype of our
model, we found that 11 of 13 different Tsc2þ/Em-Myc cell
lines were capable of generating the ACS phenotype described
herein; all produced high levels of IL-10 in comparison with 2
lines that failed to generate an ACS phenotype and which
showed baseline levels of IL-10 (data not shown). We note that
IL-10 effects may be context dependent as in the C26 IL-6 driven
cachexia model it has been shown to protect against cachexia
(25, 38). Future experiments will be required to deﬁne which
features of the ACS phenotype present in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc
tumor-bearing mice are due to elevated IL-10 levels.
We note also that the Tsc2þ/Em-Myc model presents some
differences with other cachexia models and the human condition. (i) Adipose tissue loss in human cachexia can vary
signiﬁcantly, ranging from considerable residual fat mass (39)
to quite signiﬁcant loss (40). In the Tsc2þ/Em-Myc model, we
clearly have an extreme effect of complete epididymal fat lost

An Myc/mTOR-Driven Model of Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome

at the terminal stage. (ii) As well, IL-6, a multifunctional
cytokine, is strongly implicated in cachexia. Administration
of IL-6 to mice is sufﬁcient to recapitulate the muscle wasting
and fat loss phenotype of ACS (41, 42), IL-6 blocking agents
reduce the severity of muscle wasting in the C26 model
(8, 24, 26, 27, 43, 44), and its overexpression is implicated in
the pathogenesis of cachexia in several mouse models, including mice bearing the C26 cell line (5, 26, 45). One mechanism by
which IL-6 has been implicated in this process is through
activation of STAT3 signaling following binding to its receptor
in muscle cells, leading to muscle-based production of acute
phase proteins (28). It will be interesting to determine whether
phospho-STAT3 levels are elevated in the Tsc2þ/Em-Myc
model. Along these lines, we note that IL-10 has also been
shown to activate STAT3 in cardiomyocytes through an Aktdependent mechanism (46). Were IL-6 and IL-10 to share a
common effector target such as STAT3, this could suggest
redundant roles for IL-6 and IL-10 in muscle wasting. (iii)
Third, IL-6 expression in B cells may be regulated in a manner
that precludes its overexpression. During development, IL-6
induces terminal differentiation and ultimately cell death of B
cells (47). However, IL-6 can also participate in autocrine loops
in some cancers to promote survival by signaling to the
prosurvival protein, Mcl-1 (48). Because, Mcl-1 synergizes with
Myc in the Em-Myc model to accelerate lymphomagenesis (49),
expression of IL-6 may be tightly balanced in Tsc2þ//Em-Myc
cells to sufﬁciently maintain antiapoptotic effects (through
Mcl-1 upregulation) while avoiding cellular differentiation and
death.
We found that in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc cells IL-10 protein production was under mTOR translational control (Fig. 3D–F).
Accordingly, inhibition of mTOR signaling or translation with
rapamycin or homoharringtonine, respectively, alleviated the
cachexic phenotype and correlated with reduced IL-10 mRNA
translation. Rapamycin and homoharringtonine were also
effective in the C26 mouse model where IL-6 is the major
cachexic driver (Fig. 5). When considered together with the
ﬁnding that IL-6 production is linked to mTOR activity (29),
these results show that suppression of cytokine production by

targeting translation may ameliorate the cachexic phenotype
in some settings (Figs. 4 and 5). More extensive experiments
will be required to determine whether rapamycin or homoharringtonine are exerting their effects by curtailing protein
synthesis in Tsc2þ/Em-Myc/Mcl-1 tumor cells, on host targets, or a combination of both.
Another strategy to prevent, and even reverse the effects of
cachexia, has recently been described and involves inhibiting
ActRIIB, a high afﬁnity activin type 2 receptor involved in
TGF-b signaling (50). Impressively, pharmacologic blockade of
this pathway in muscles halts and reverses muscle wasting in
cancer-induced cachexia (50). Currently, there is no approved
effective treatment for muscle wasting in cachexia and targeting protein synthesis could complement muscle-directed therapies aimed at providing relief from ACS.
