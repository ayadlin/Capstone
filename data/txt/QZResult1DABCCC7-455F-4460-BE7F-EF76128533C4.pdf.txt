The Molecular Basis of Synergism between Carboplatin and
ABT-737 Therapy Targeting Ovarian Carcinomas
Harsh Vardhan Jain1 and Michael Meyer-Hermann2,3

Abstract
Resistance to standard chemotherapy (carboplatin þ paclitaxel) is one of the leading causes of therapeutic
failure in ovarian carcinomas. Emergence of chemoresistance has been shown to be mediated in part by members
of the Bcl family of proteins including the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, whose expression is correlated with shorter
disease-free intervals in recurrent disease. ABT-737 is an example of one of the first small-molecule inhibitors of
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL that has been shown to increase the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin. To exploit the
therapeutic potential of these two drugs and predict optimal doses and dose scheduling, it is essential to
understand the molecular basis of their synergistic action. Here, we build and calibrate a mathematical model of
ABT-737 and carboplatin action on an ovarian cancer cell line (IGROV-1). The model suggests that carboplatin
treatment primes cells for ABT-737 therapy because of an increased dependence of cells with DNA damage on BclxL for survival. Numerical simulations predict the existence of a threshold of Bcl-xL below which these cells are
unable to recover. Furthermore, co- plus posttreatment of ABT-737 with carboplatin is predicted to be the best
strategy to maximize synergism between these two drugs. A critical challenge in chemotherapy is to strike a
balance between maximizing cell-kill while minimizing patient drug load. We show that the model can be used to
compute minimal doses required for any desired fraction of cell kill. These results underscore the potential of the
modeling work presented here as a valuable quantitative tool to aid in the translation of novel drugs such as ABT737 from the experimental to clinical setting and highlight the need for close collaboration between modelers and
experimental scientists. Cancer Res; 71(3); 705–15. 2010 AACR.

Major Findings
The reduced ability of DNA-damaged cancer cells to
withstand changes in intracellular Bcl-xL concentration is
predicted to be the principle reason behind the observed
synergism between carboplatin and ABT-737. This suggests co- plus post-treatment of tumors by ABT-737 with
carboplatin as the optimal strategy to maximize cell-kill,
whilst minimizing patient drug load.

been made in its treatment with the introduction of platinumtaxane–based chemotherapy since the 1980s, the mortality rate
remains largely unchanged in the past 2 decades (1). The
overall 5-year survival rate is only 29%, possibly due to infrequent early diagnosis coupled with the emergence of drug
resistance in recurrent disease (2). The current gold standard
for chemotherapy targeting ovarian cancer is a combination of
carboplatin, a platinum-based compound, together with paclitaxel, an antimitotic drug. In fact, a majority of patients
respond well to this treatment initially. However, most will
suffer relapse following complete clinical response and the
emergence of drug resistance is observed in a majority of these
cases, implying an overall poor prognosis (3).
Several factors may contribute to this drug resistance,
including decreased drug uptake by and/or increased efflux
from cancer cells, increased rate of drug-induced DNA damage
repair, loss of p53 function, and protection from apoptosis
(3, 4). In particular, ectopic expression of the apoptosis
inhibitor protein Bcl-xL has been linked to drug resistance.
Bcl-xL is a member of the Bcl-2 family of intracellular proteins
that are crucial regulators of programmed cell death (5). In
ovarian cancers, Bcl-xL expression in primary tumors is associated with shorter disease-free intervals following successive
bouts of chemotherapy (6). Furthermore, in vitro studies have
shown that overexpression of Bcl-xL confers resistance to cell
death induced by a variety of chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin (a carboplatin analogue), and paclitaxel (6–8).

Quick Guide to Main Model Equations
The model schematic for tumor cell growth inhibition mediated by application of carboplatin and ABT-737 is presented in
Fig. 1. The following is a brief description of the principal equations and underlying assumptions that drive this reaction diagram.
Here, N and M refer to proliferating and arrested tumor cell numbers per well (ovarian cancer cell line IGROV-1), respectively. B,
C, X, and P are total unbound Bcl-xL, carboplatin, free ABT-737, and Bcl-xL–ABT-737 complex concentration in micromoles per
well, respectively. For a detailed description of the model and various terms, we refer the reader to the Supplementary Material.

(A)

This equation models the growth of proliferating IGROV-1 tumor cells in conditioned growth medium, in vitro, as described in
ref. 11. Therapy is provided in the form of carboplatin (C) and ABT-737 (X) alone, or in combination. Tumor cells proliferate at a
constant rate, ln, whereas their rate of death d n is mediated by the amount of free Bcl-xL per cell, b. Note that b ¼ B/T, where
Rt
T ¼ NðtÞ þ 0 Mðt; aÞda is the total number of IGROV-1 cells at any time t. Furthermore, in response to carboplatin therapy,
proliferating cells undergo cell-cycle arrest at a rate, a, dependent on the amount of carboplatin administered, C.

Major Assumptions of the Model
Assumption on apoptosis control
To keep the number of unknown parameters at a minimum, proapoptotic members of the Bcl family are not included in our
model; instead, cell survival is assumed to depend on free Bcl-xL, which, in conjugation with its proapoptotic counterparts and its
free concentration per cell, is taken into account while estimating parameters relating to Bcl-xL dynamics (See Table 1 and
Supplementary Material, Section B2).
Assumption on arrested cell recovery
An additional source term for N is M(t, a ¼ ar). This represents cells that are able to recover from carboplatin-induced DNA
damage, with some characteristic recovery time ar, and is described in Equation (B).
qM qM
þ
¼ dm ½b; Cðt  aÞ; aM
qt
qa
Arrested IGROV-1 cells undergo apoptosis in an age-structured manner (a is the age variable), with death rate dm proportional
to the amount of carboplatin present at the time of cell-cycle arrest [C(t  a)] and the amount of unbound Bcl-xL per cell, b. The
following boundary condition is imposed on this equation:
Mðt; 0Þ ¼ aðCÞN

(B)

This is a source term for M, which corresponds to the rate of cell-cycle arrest  of proliferating cells in Equation (A).
Assumption on DNA repair
On the basis of experimental observations in ref. 11, it is assumed that arrested cells begin to undergo apoptosis approximately
16 hours after the application of carboplatin. This time of onset of death may be reduced if free Bcl-xL levels are lowered because
of the application of ABT-737. The delay of 16 hours is explained by the sequence of events that follow DNA damage, including
damage recognition, followed by DNA repair or eventual cell death. A detailed review of these events is presented in ref. 21.
Furthermore, on the basis of experimental observations in ref. 11, it is assumed that the arrested cells that have not undergone
apoptosis after 48 hours recover to the proliferating population. In the absence of data by which to estimate a rate of recovery, it is
taken to occur instantaneously at the end of this time period. Thus, ar is taken to have a value of 48 hours.
Assumption on carboplatin degradation
Following ref. 31, the rate of carboplatin decay in culture medium is assumed to obey the first-order kinetics.

(C)

In ref. 31, in vitro cell proliferation assays of Jurkat cells cultured in the presence of carboplatin showed that for cell
concentrations below 107 per mL, the rate of decay lc of carboplatin was unaffected by the presence of cells and was in fact
approximately linear. In the experimental conditions relevant to our model, IGROV-1 cell numbers do not exceed 106 per mL.

level bs of expression of free Bcl-xL. This represents an addition to the total Bcl-xL concentration B at the rate lnNbs, whereas cell
death in both proliferating and arrested cell populations results in the loss of Bcl-xL. The integral term in the rate of loss of Bcl-xL
due to arrested cell death reflects the fact that apoptosis in cells of all ages in this compartment must be accounted for. Finally,
free Bcl-xL may interact with its small molecule inhibitor ABT-737 (X) to form complexes (P), where k1 is the forward rate of the
reaction B þ XP and k1 is the backward rate.
Assumption on ABT-737 dynamics
The dynamics of free ABT-737 concentration in cell culture medium is given by

(E)

ABT-737 undergoes decay at a rate lx, corresponding to its natural half-life. Given the small size of small molecule inhibitors
such as ABT-737 and their large permeability through cell membrane, it is assumed that ABT-737 is free to move in and out of
cells, and when inside cells, it rapidly forms complexes P with Bcl-xL.
Conversely, inhibition of Bcl-xL expression with transfection
by bcl-xS (9), small interfering RNA (siRNA; refs. 10, 11), or a
monoclonal antibody (ABT-737; ref. 11) increases sensitivity of
ovarian cancer cell lines to these chemotherapeutic agents. It
may therefore be concluded that concomitant inhibition of
Bcl-xL with chemotherapy could be an attractive treatment
strategy for this cancer type (10, 11).
Witham and colleagues assess the therapeutic potential of
cotreatment of an ovarian cancer cell line (IGROV-1) expressing Bcl-xL with ABT-737 and carboplatin (11). ABT-737
belongs to a class of compounds that are nonpeptidic small
molecule inhibitors of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 proteins and has been
shown to exhibit significant single-agent activity against small
cell lung carcinoma tumor xenografts in mice (12). It acts by
blocking the Bcl-xL–BH3 binding groove, which prevents it
from sequestering proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family
such as Bad, Bid, and Bim (13). According to Witham and
colleagues (11), ABT-737 shows modest cytotoxic activity as a
single-agent in in vitro cell proliferation assays of IGROV-1
cells. However, when given in combination with carboplatin,
an increase in cell growth inhibition, coupled with a decrease
in time to apoptosis, is observed. In fact, the relative timing of
scheduling of the two drugs plays an important role in
determining therapy efficacy. Posttreatment of cells with
ABT-737, following treatment with carboplatin, is predicted
to be the best strategy, indicating that carboplatin sensitizes
the cells to anti-Bcl-xL therapy. Finally, IGROV-1 tumor xenografts in mice are shown to respond equally well to the 2 drugs
delivered alone, whereas therapy efficacy is greatly enhanced
when the drugs are given in combination.
Although these findings have the potential of representing a
significant advance in the treatment of ovarian cancers, an
important step in the realization of these therapies is to
develop an understanding of the molecular basis of synergism
between such drugs. Evaluating key parameters such as the
degree of synergism and optimization of chemotherapeutic
schedules can be time consuming and costly. Quantitative
modeling such as that described in this article has the potential
to answer these questions while providing further insights into
the mechanism of action of these therapies. We have previously
developed models of tumor growth (14–16) and evaluated the

www.aacrjournals.org

therapeutic potential of small molecule inhibitors of Bcl-2 as
antiangiogenic agents (17, 18). In this article, we present a
multiscale model, with age structure of combination chemotherapy and anti-Bcl-xL therapy targeting ovarian carcinomas, that is validated by direct comparison with experimental
results taken from Witham and colleagues (11). Using this, we
are able to provide a quantitative justification for the hypothesis that carboplatin sensitizes cancer cells to ABT-737. We
propose an optimal dosing regimen for carboplatin and ABT737 and thus provide a useful tool to make predictions relating
to treatment protocols for drugs that are similar in action to
these compounds.

Materials and Methods
Model foundation
To capture the relevant intracellular dynamics of Bcl-xL–
controlled cell apoptosis, a biochemically motivated ordinary
differential equation model was developed. This was linked
to a population-level model describing cell culture growth
dynamics. An age structure was imposed on this to accurately
simulate carboplatin-induced DNA damage and subsequent
cell death. A model schematic detailing the effects of carboplatin and ABT-737 on a population of ovarian cancer
(IGROV-1) cells is shown in Fig. 1. The choice of this particular
cell line is based on the experiments described in ref. 11,
wherein IGROV-1 cells were shown to specifically express high
levels of Bcl-xL while expressing little or no Bcl-2. Furthermore, they exhibited maximum sensitivity to ABT-737 as a
single agent.
The following sections describe the principles underlying our
model formulation. All simulations of the model were carried
out on Matlab. The simulation methodology is described in
greater detail in Supplementary Material, Section C.
Bcl-xL as a regulator of cell death
IGROV-1 cells have been shown to grow exponentially (19)
in the time frame of interest to us (the experiments described
in ref. 11) were conducted over an average of 4 to 5 days. We
therefore assume an exponential growth for IGROV-1 cells in
the absence of therapy, as shown in Fig. 1A. The intrinsic

Figure 1. Model schematic. A, IGROV-1 cells are assumed to grow exponentially when cultured in the presence of growth medium and in the absence
of any therapy. B, in the case wherein IGROV-1 cells are treated with ABT-737 alone, cell death rate is taken to be a function of intracellular free Bcl-xL
level (not shown), which will be decreased upon the application of ABT-737. C, in the case wherein IGROV-1 cells are treated with carboplatin alone,
they undergo cell-cycle arrest at a rate dependent on the amount of drug delivered. The arrested cells subsequently undergo apoptosis at a rate proportional to
the amount of drug present at the time of arrest. This occurs in an age-dependent fashion to account for experimentally observed time lag between
therapy administration and PARP cleavage leading to cell death. Recovery of arrested cells to the proliferating population is also accounted for. D, in the case
wherein IGROV-1 cells are treated with carboplatin and ABT-737 in combination, the two modules described in B and C previously are put together, with
arrested IGROV-1 cell death rate and time to onset of death now a function of Bcl-xL levels.

growth rate of the cells is fit to cell proliferation data taken
from ref. 19, as shown in Fig. 2A.
Next, we include in our model, the regulation of cellular
apoptosis controlled by Bcl-xL, a schematic for which is shown
in Fig. 1B. The intrinsic growth rate of IGROV-1 cells estimated
earlier is divided into a constant proliferation rate, ln, together
with a death rate that is taken to be a function of unbound Bcl-xL
concentration per cell. Choosing the death rate in this manner
allows us to avoid estimating intracellular levels for a number
of proteins and binding parameters, for which little or no
experimental data are available. Furthermore, ABT-737 shows
specific activity against Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (12), of which IGROV-1
cells do not express Bcl-2 (11). Therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that changes in intracellular Bcl-xL induced by ABT-737
would contribute to cell death in this experimental setup.
To model the effect of application of ABT-737 therapy, its
concentration (X) is tracked in time, together with the concentration of Bcl-xL summed over all cells (B). In the absence
of experimental data detailing the mechanism of entry of small
molecule inhibitors into the cell, it is assumed that ABT-737 is
free to move in and out of the cell, and once inside the cell, it
complexes rapidly with Bcl-xL. This is a reasonable assump-

tion, as these small molecule inhibitors are designed to be cell
wall permeable. The law of mass action is used to translate the
binding reaction between ABT-737 and Bcl-xL into a system of
differential equations that govern the temporal dynamics of
these molecules (20).
The precise functional form for the death rate of proliferating
cells is chosen by conducting fits of the model to in vitro cell
growth inhibition data taken from ref. 11, wherein ABT-737
therapy is applied singly to IGROV-1 cell cultures (see Fig. 2B).
The resultant rate reflects the fact that a drop in the levels of
Bcl-xL, possibly due to binding ABT-737, would free proapoptotic proteins of the Bcl family such as Bax and Bak that are
otherwise sequestered by Bcl-xL. These would then be able to
translocate to the cell mitochondria, inducing release of cytochrome c and triggering the apoptotic pathway. Details regarding the fit are presented in Supplementary Material, Section B2.
An age-structured model of carboplatin therapy
The cytotoxicity of carboplatin is primarily due to its interaction with nucleophilic N-7 sites of purine bases in DNA to
form intrastrand adducts. This DNA damage is subsequently
recognized by a number of candidate proteins such as the

In the absence of values in the literature, biologically realistic values for these parameters were chosen so that the solution profiles
best fit experimental observation as described in refs. 11 and 19.
b
In the absence of data, intracellular expression of Bcl-xL was taken to be similar to that of Bcl-2 (IGROV-1 cells are known to express
only Bcl-xL and not Bcl-2; ref. 11). Typical expression of Bcl-2 in cells is 75 nmol/L (28). However, much of this is sequestered by the
proapoptotic members of the Bcl family such as Bax and Bid. Typical expression levels of these are in the range of 200 to 600 nmol/L
Bax (29) and 25 nmol/L Bid (28), respectively. Furthermore, the dissociation constant for Bcl-2 binding with proapoptotic proteins in
the Bcl family can be as low as 0.6 nmol/L (30). Using reaction rates for Bcl-2 binding to Bax taken from ref. 27, we get that free Bcl-2
concentrations can range from 0.008 to 0.3 nmol/L per cell. Therefore, a value of 0.15 nmol/L lying between these two limits was
chosen to represent the free Bcl-xL expression levels in IGROV-1 cells.
c
The half-life of Bcl-xL was assumed to be similar to that of Bcl-2. This has a reported value of between 12 and 20 hours; therefore, a
mean value of 16 hours is chosen.
d
The rate of Bcl-xL production is chosen so that all cells constitutively express bS amount of free Bcl-xL. This gives g 0 ¼ 2lb bs .
e
It was assumed that the rate of forward reaction of ABT-737 with Bcl-xL was similar to that of Bax binding to Bcl-2 because of their
comparable binding affinities.
f
The binding affinity of ABT-737 with Bcl-xL is 1 nmol/L.
g
The half-life of ABT-737 in culture medium is taken to be the same as that of 072RB, another small molecule inhibitor of the Bclfamily. It should be noted that the range of half-lives of other small molecule inhibitors such as sHA-14-I and Su5416 also has similar
reported values.

nonhistone chromosomal high-mobility groups 1 and 2. This
results in the activation of a number of downstream pathways
that could eventually lead to cell-cycle arrest, followed by a
decision to survive or undergo apoptosis based on the extent
and hence reparability of DNA damage. Many mechanisms
related to these pathways remain to be elucidated (21).
To model these effects of application of carboplatin therapy
on IGROV-1 cells, an additional compartment is added to the
cell population, a schematic of which is presented in Fig. 1C.
Upon drug application, the proliferating cells will undergo cellcycle arrest at a certain rate dependent on the amount of therapy
administered. A Hill-like functional form with Hill coefficient 1 is
chosen to represent this rate (see Supplementary Material,

www.aacrjournals.org

Section B3), as it makes the biologically realistic assumption
that when carboplatin concentration is zero, there will be no
change in DNA integrity. As the amount of drug applied
increases, the rate of cell-cycle arrest increases because of
increasing levels of DNA damage, up to a maximum level.
Furthermore, this profile also matches the cell proliferation
assays as described in ref. 11, wherein carboplatin-induced cell
growth inhibition was reported to follow a Hill function curve.
The arrested cells are removed to a separate compartment,
where the cells will undergo apoptosis or will recover to the
proliferating population. An age structure is imposed on the
cells in this compartment to reflect the time taken from
induction of DNA damage to eventual cell death or recovery.

counts of IGROV-1 cells cultured in the presence of growth medium alone (19). B, for the case when ABT-737 is administered to IGROV-1 cell cultures, the
model is modified according to that described in Fig. 1B. This is subsequently fit to cell growth and survival assays, as that described in ref. 11, wherein

levels drop very rapidly (inset, C) and recover at a rate dependent on the quantity of ABT-737 delivered. Black squares, experimental data.

Models of chemotherapy have previously incorporated an age
structure that is imparted to the equations governing cell
growth, as it progresses through the cell cycle (22, 23). However, it is known that carboplatin is not cell-cycle specific and
affects cells in all stages of the cell cycle (24). Thus, in our
model, we do not distinguish between the various phases of
cell growth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
that an age structure has been applied to a model of platinumbased chemotherapy wherein the age of arrested cells is
tracked to mimic the experimentally observed delay in the
onset of apoptosis from the time of cell arrest.
It has been experimentally determined that cell cytotoxicity
is linearly correlated with the amount of platinum bound to
the DNA and hence the extent of DNA damage (21). This is
reflected in our choice of the rate of arrested cell death. This is
taken to be function of age a of the arrested cell and the
amount of carboplatin at the time of cell-cycle arrest, C(t  a).
These cells begin dying at some characteristic age achar,
determined experimentally to be 48 hours in ref. 11. Cells
are also allowed to recover to the proliferating population, as
explained in Equation (B) of the Quick Guide. Both the rate of
arrest of proliferating cells and the rate of arrested cell death

710

Cancer Res; 71(3) February 1, 2011

are fit to in vitro cell growth inhibition data taken from ref. 11,
wherein carboplatin therapy is applied singly to IGROV-1 cell
cultures (see Fig. 3). Further details regarding the fits are
presented in Supplementary Material, Section B3.
Finally, to simulate combination therapy, the two singletherapy modules must be combined appropriately. We first
note that it has been experimentally shown that Bcl-xL does not
protect cells from undergoing cell-cycle arrest as a result of
chemotherapy-induced DNA damage (8). We therefore propose the following model schematic, as shown in Fig. 1D.
Carboplatin induces DNA damage leading to cell-cycle arrest
and subsequent cell death, which might be accentuated by
anti-Bcl-xL therapy. This, of course, also has an effect on
proliferating IGROV-1 cells and has been quantified earlier.
In this case, we have two unknown functions that need to be
determined—the time of onset of arrested cell death, which is
now a function of intracellular Bcl-xL (as opposed to a constant
in the carboplatin-only case), and arrested cell death rate,
which must also depend on intracellular Bcl-xL in addition
to arrested cell age and the amount of carboplatin at the time of
cell-cycle arrest. The full set of equations modeling combination therapy is given in Supplementary Material, Section A.

of ABT-737 alone. Figure 2B shows the best fit to the experimental data in terms of IGROV-1 cell number N at the end of
4 days of therapy. Figure 2C and D show the corresponding
intracellular Bcl-xL levels (b) and ABT-737 concentrations (X),
respectively. It is observed that the application of therapy on
day 0 causes a sharp decrease in the intracellular Bcl-xL level.
As the amount of drug delivered is increased, the cells take
longer to recover their constitutive levels of Bcl-xL expression,
even though most of the free drug has degraded by this time.
Figure 3B shows the best fit to the experimental data in
terms of total IGROV-1 cell number T at the end of 4 days of
carboplatin therapy administered at day 0. Here, the death
rate of arrested cells has already been estimated as described
in Supplementary Materials and plotted in Fig. 3A. As can be
seen, in agreement with experimental data, the arrested cells
begin dying at around 16 hours posttherapy. Figure 3C shows
the carboplatin concentration (C) for varying doses administered at day 0. Given the relatively low rate of carboplatin
decay, even at the end of 4 days of therapy, the level of drug in
cell culture assays remains high, indicating that the time
period of action of a single dose of carboplatin is significantly
longer than that of ABT-737.

percentage of IGROV-1 cells surviving was recorded over a period of 48
hours, as in experiments described in ref. 11. The death rate of arrested
cells is estimated from these data as a function of carboplatin
concentration and time from the application of therapy, and the resulting fit

cultures, the model is modified according to that described in Fig. 1C.
This is subsequently fit to cell growth and survival assays, as that
described in ref. 11, wherein cells are treated with varying amounts of

profiles (in micromoles per liter per well) as a function of time are shown.

Carboplatin treatment primes cells for anti-Bcl-xL
therapy
We begin our simulation of combination therapy by simulating a cell growth inhibition assay as described in ref. 11,
wherein the amount of ABT-737 administered on day 0 was
fixed at 0.6 mmol/L, which by itself would result only in a 6% to
7% growth inhibition after 4 days (Fig. 4C, solid circle and
dashed line) as compared with the no-therapy control case
(Fig. 4C, asterisk and dotted line). The amount of carboplatin
coadministered was adjusted so that 50% growth inhibition
was achieved by day 4. It was observed that 10 mmol/L
carboplatin was required in addition to 0.6 mmol/L ABT-737
to achieve this. Administered without any ABT-737 cotreatment, 10 mmol/L carboplatin would induce only a 30% growth
inhibition in the same period (Fig. 4C, solid triangle and dashdotted line). Thus, the effect of combination therapy, assuming
mutually independent action of the 2 drugs, is predicted to be
only 37% growth inhibition. This implies that to simulate the
observed synergism between the drugs, and given that anti-BclxL therapy does not affect the rate of carboplatin-induced cellcycle arrest (8), the additional growth inhibition must be a
result of enhanced arrested cell death rate because of ABT737–induced lowering of intracellular Bcl-xLb. This assumption
is built into the model as depicted in Fig. 1D and quantified in
our fits of arrested cell death rate (Fig. 4B) and time to onset of
arrested cell apoptosis [achar(b); Fig. 4A]. Note that experimental data relating to relative timing of dosage of ABT-737
and carboplatin, as described in following sections, are also
taken into account while conducting these fits. The resultant fit
to cell growth inhibition data is shown in Fig. 4C. The model
further predicts that in this scenario, most of the arrested cells
undergo apoptosis and are extremely unlikely to recover to the
proliferating population (data not shown).

Figure 4. Combination therapy. A, in the case wherein IGROV-1 cells were cultured in the presence of both carboplatin and ABT-737, it was observed
that the time of onset of arrested cell death was decreased (11). Hence, the dependence of this death rate on intracellular Bcl-xL concentration is determined by
fitting experimental data taken from ref. 11. Black squares, experimental data. B, in the case of combination therapy, the (normalized) maximum death
rate of arrested cells is shown as a function of intracellular Bcl-xL. The model is modified according to that described in Fig. 1D, and a fit is carried out to data
shown in Figs. 4C and 5 in order to estimate the functional form of the Bcl-xL–dependent death rate of arrested cells. The experimental data being fit
is in the form of several combination indices based on scheduling of ABT-737 with respect to carboplatin therapy as reported in ref. 11. To match these data, it
is necessary to assume that the arrested cells that have incurred DNA damage as a result of carboplatin therapy are extremely sensitive to changes in
intracellular Bcl-xL—if this level decreases by more than 1%, the cells will undergo apoptosis. C, an additional data point used to fit Bcl-xL–dependent
death rate of arrested cells is the 50% cell growth inhibition that results from coadministering 10 mmol/L carboplatin with 0.6 mmol/L ABT-737. Shown here is
the resultant fit. Data point, black square; simulation, solid line. Inset, the effect of combination therapy on intracellular Bcl-xL. Also plotted are the
effects of giving these drug doses alone on IGROV-1 cell growth, with model simulations in dotted or dashed lines. D, simulations of the full model are
carried out to obtain CI values (inscribed on the dosage curve) computed for a 50% desired cell kill for various combinations of carboplatin and ABT-737.
Following the experimental protocol in ref. 11, it is assumed that both drugs are given simultaneously at day 0 and the level of growth inhibition of IGROV-1
cells recorded at day 4. The indicated value (dotted lines) is the experimental data point available from ref. 11. Simulations indicate that a combination
of 1.2 mmol/L ABT-737 together with 8 mmol/L carboplatin maximizes the synergism between the 2 drugs.

ABT-737 impairs the ability of cells to recover from
DNA damage
To fit experimental data relating to relative timing of
ABT-737 and carboplatin application (shown in Fig. 5, last
column, rows 1–5), a number of different functional forms
were tried for arrested cell death rate (for details, see
Supplementary Material, Section B4). In these experiments,
carboplatin was administered to IGROV-1 cells in culture for
1 day, the cells were pre-, co-, or posttreated with 0.6 mmol/L
ABT-737, and cell growth inhibition was recorded at day 4
(Fig. 5, as in ref. 11, solid boxes indicate all drug washed from

712

Cancer Res; 71(3) February 1, 2011

cell culture). It was found that posttreatment with ABT-737
induced maximum level of synergism between the two drugs
and was proposed as regimen of choice. The best fit to these
data was obtained upon assuming that a greater than 1%
fluctuation in the value of intracellular Bcl-xL implies that
the arrested cells will be unable to recover from DNA
damage and consequently undergo apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Note
that the experimental data point in the last column of row 5
(Fig. 5) does not match with our model simulations (penultimate column, row 5). This is discussed in further detail in
the next section.

The Molecular Basis of Synergism between Carboplatin

Figure 5. Scheduling of ABT-737. IGROV-1 cells are treated with a range of concentrations of carboplatin for a period of 24 hours and pretreated,
cotreated, or posttreated with 0.6 or 1.2 mmol/L ABT-737. Following the convention in ref. 11, rectangular boxes indicate the addition of new drug and
removal of any drug previously added. Carboplatin is administered on day 1 and removed 24 hours later. Combination indices (CI; last column) are
computed for a 50% desired cell kill, as reported in ref. 11 and are used to fit the full model system as in Fig. 1D describing combination therapy. For the various
dosing regimens, IC50 of carboplatin as estimated numerically is reported in micromoles per liter values. For comparison with experimental CI values, a ratio of
the various IC50 values with that from schedule number 3 (a ¼ 44 mmol/L) is used, as this has a reported CI of 1 and therefore regarded as the baseline. In
general, there is a good agreement with the experimental data. Simultaneous treatment and posttreatment with ABT-737 are predicted as the best therapeutic
strategy that fully exploits the basis of synergism between the 2 therapies in the case when the total dose of ABT-737 is fixed at 1.2 mmol/L.

Optimal dose scheduling regimens
Having extensively calibrated and fitted our model, we can
now use it to investigate in detail the levels of synergism
predicted for various dose-scheduling regimens. Following the
experimental protocol laid down in ref. (11), we take as an
indication of level of synergism a ratio of the predicted
carboplatin concentration required to obtain 50% cell growth
inhibition when combined with 1 to 3 doses of ABT-737 each
of 0.6 mmol/L, with the control case, wherein the cells are
cotreated with both drugs for 24 hours (row 3). A ratio of 1 or
greater indicates suboptimal dosing, whereas a ratio of less
than 1 indicates optimal dosing. (Combination indices calculated as described in ref. 25. See Supplementary Material,
Section D for an explanation of these calculations.) Therefore,
to find an optimal schedule, we need to minimize the amount
of carboplatin required, for a given fixed amount of ABT-737
administered, to achieve a desired cell-kill fraction, by varying
the timing of administering the two drugs with respect to each
other. As can be seen from the first 5 rows of Fig. 5, the

www.aacrjournals.org

experimental data and model simulations both predict that
pretreatment of IGROV-1 cells with ABT-737 is a suboptimal
strategy. However, the true usefulness of the model lies in the
ability to test dosing regimens suggested by but yet untested in
experiments and which would take a very long time if carried
out. Simulation indicates that cotreatment, followed by
immediate posttreatment with ABT-737, indicates greater
therapeutic benefit than purely posttreatment (row 2 vs. rows
7 and 8). This is also a better strategy than simply cotreatment
but with double dose of ABT-737 (row 9). Finally, pretreatment
in all but case 6 (rows 4, 5, and 10) seems to do worse as
compared with any strategy that avoids pretreatment. Thus, in
agreement with experimental results, the model predicts that
if only a single dose of ABT-737 may be given in combination
with carboplatin therapy, posttreatment is the best option
(row 1). However, if 2 doses of ABT-737 are allowed, the best
strategy is predicted to be cotreatment, immediately followed
by posttreatment (row 2). Note that in row 6, as 3 doses of
ABT-737 are being delivered, best results are predicted. In fact,

if 3 doses of ABT-737 are allowed, the model predicts that 1 to
2 doses must be given post–carboplatin treatment; the timing
of the third dose is relatively flexible (not shown). Therefore, in
all cases, posttreatment with ABT-737 is indicated.
Prediction of optimal relative dosages
Finally, we turn our attention to a key question that arises in
the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancers—"What should
the relative dose sizes of two (or more) drugs be, in order to
maximize tumor cell exposure, while minimizing the amount
of drugs administered?" Figure 4D is a phase diagram showing
the amounts of carboplatin and ABT-737 required to achieving
a desired cell growth inhibition of 50% when these two drugs
are administered simultaneously. Here, minimizing patient
drug load is equivalent to minimizing their CI. (Note: We are
attempting to minimize the following function, subject to
the condition that after 4 days, cell numbers in culture should
be half the value in the case when no therapy is given.
Xð0Þ
CI ¼ Cð0Þ
C5 0 þ X5 0 . Here, C(0) and X(0) are the doses of carboplatin and ABT-737 administered at time t ¼ 0; C50 and X50 are
the amounts of the two drugs required to achieve 50% growth
inhibition when administered singly; C(0) is allowed to vary
between 0 and C50 and the constraint used to generate values
of X(0). This may be regarded as an optimization problem in a
single variable C(0) that takes values on a closed interval and
therefore attains its minimum therein.) A computation of the
CI for each pair of doses is enumerated along the dose curve. A
combination of 8 mmol/L carboplatin together with 1.2 mmol/
L ABT-737 is predicted to optimize the synergism between the
2 drugs. Such phase diagrams can similarly be computed for
any desired cell kill.

Discussion
In this article, we presented a model of combination
chemotherapy comprising the platinum-based drug carboplatin, together with a novel small molecule inhibitor ABT-737, in
the case of ovarian carcinomas. To elucidate the mechanism
of interaction between the 2 drugs, details of the apoptotic
pathway were incorporated at a molecular level and a cell age
structure was applied to simulate the effect of DNA damage on
cell fate. The model was extensively calibrated against experimental data and subsequently used to make key predictions
regarding dose and schedule optimization that arise in the
field of cancer chemotherapeutics.
The model could verify the experimentally proposed hypothesis that carboplatin sensitizes cancer cells for treatment with
ABT-737. In fact, it explicitly emerged from our simulations that
the principal reason for this is the reduced ability of DNAdamaged cells to withstand changes in intracellular Bcl-xL
concentration. In addition, a hypothesized reduction in the
time of onset of arrested cell death as a result of coadministration of ABT-737 with carboplatin was predicted to have limited
impact on cell growth inhibition and therefore on synergism
between the 2 drugs. The model further predicted the existence
of a threshold for intracellular Bcl-xL concentration below
which carboplatin-treated cells are unable to survive.

It has been proposed that insufficient exposure of tumor
cells to drugs could contribute to chemoresistance development, calling for a need to conduct studies aimed at optimizing
chemotherapeutic schedules (26). However, such studies have
typically high financial as well as human costs. Using modeling
such as that presented here to arrive at principles of optimal
dose scheduling can lead to significant cost savings and faster
clinically applicable results. For instance, for a maximum of 2
fixed doses of ABT-737 and a single dose of carboplatin, we
predicted that cotreatment immediately, followed by posttreatment of ABT-737 with carboplatin, was the best strategy. In
fact, such regimens can easily be computed for any given
number of doses of the 2 drugs to be administered over a
given length of time. Likewise, fixing the target cell kill at 50%,
we were able to predict dose sizes of these 2 drugs to be
coadministered in order to optimize their synergism and hence
minimize patient drug load. Such phase diagrams can also be
computed for any desired cell kill to minimize drug dose or
under a constraint on the maximum tolerated amount of each
drug to maximize cell kill. Although this is, of course, not
intended to replace clinical testing, it can minimize the various
choices that need to be examined experimentally, in addition
to being a quantitative tool useful for interpreting experimental
results.
Relative dose scheduling experiments reported in ref. 11
suggest that pretreatment of IGROV-1 cells with ABT-737,
followed by cotreatment with carboplatin and ABT-737, is
suboptimal (Fig. 5, row 5, last column). However, this is in
contradiction to the additive effect predicted when cells are
simply cotreated with the 2 drugs (Fig. 5, row 3, last column),
as in the previous case, one is starting with fewer cells at the
time of cotreatment. Our model predicted a near-additive
effect in both cases, and an experiment such as that suggested
in row 6 of the same figure, where pre-, co-, and posttreatment
is carried out, would help to understand this apparent discrepancy.
The model presented here was conscientiously fit to relevant experimental data and a balance between incorporating
the maximum possible biological details and keeping
unknowns to a minimum was striven for. The simplicity of
the model, combined with good agreement between numerical simulations and experimental data, suggests that it may
be a valuable tool for hypothesis generation. However, the
quality of the model predictions will have to be verified in
further experiments. For instance, instead of recording cell
growth inhibition in response to the various therapies at the
end of 4 days, it would be extremely useful to maintain a daily
cell count record. This could then be used to fine-tune the
proliferating cell death rate, rate of cell arrest, and most
important, a rate for cell recovery from DNA damage (which
is taken in to occur spontaneously after a certain length of
time in our model due to a lack of such data). A measure of the
constitutive levels of expression of some of the key players in
the Bcl family, especially Bcl-xL, would help to precisely
quantify the effect of ABT-737 on DNA-damaged cells. Then,
simulations of the predicted effect of the therapies could be
carried out with confidence on any given cell line. The input
data required would only be a comparison of the level of

expression of such proteins, which could be obtained by
methods such as Western blotting. The model described in
this article has the potential of developing into a valuable
quantitative tool to aid in the translation of drugs such as
ABT-737 from the experimental to clinical settings and underscores the need for close collaboration between modeling and
simulation efforts and experimentalists. Given the high costs
of drug development, such collaborations can have a farreaching impact on the field of cancer therapeutics.
