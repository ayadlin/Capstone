Attenuation of Tumor Growth by Formation of Antiproliferative
Glycosaminoglycans Correlates with Low Acetylation of
Histone H3
Ulrika Nilsson1,2, Richard Johnsson2, Lars-Åke Fransson1, Ulf Ellervik2, and Katrin Mani1

Abstract
Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains anchored to core proteins form proteoglycans, widely distributed cellsurface macromolecules with multiple functions, such as regulation of growth factor and cytokine signaling,
cell-cell interactions, and uptake of biomolecules. The biosynthesis of GAG can be manipulated by xylosides
attached to various hydrophobic groups, and we have earlier reported that a naphthoxyloside, 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl) β-D-xylopyranoside (XylNapOH), which serves as a primer for GAG synthesis, reduces tumor load up
to 97% in vivo, despite lower efficiency in vitro. Here we show, using radiolabeled xylosides and coculture
experiments, that XylNapOH-treated bladder and breast carcinoma cells secrete antiproliferative GAG chains
that are taken up by both normal and cancer cells and transported to the cell nuclei where they induce an
antiproliferative effect, accompanied by apoptosis. We also show that XylNapOH treatment lowers the level of
histone H3 acetylation selectively in bladder and breast carcinoma cells without affecting expression of histone H3. However, XylNapOH-primed GAG chains from normal cells are not internalized and do not cause
growth retardation. Using in vitro and in vivo C6 glioma cell and tumor models, we show that XylNapOH is
much more effective in vivo than in vitro. We propose that, in vivo, the antiproliferative XylNapOH-primed
GAG chains produced by tumor cells inhibit tumor growth in an autocrine fashion by formation of antiproliferative GAG chains on the xyloside prodrug, whereas no antiproliferative GAG chains are produced by
surrounding normal cells. This is a novel mechanism for targeting tumor cells, making these xylosides
promising drug candidates for antitumor therapy. Cancer Res; 70(9); 3771–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Proteoglycans (PG) and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are
involved in the pathobiology of cancer by interacting
with growth factors, enzymes, and chemokines and thereby
affecting cancer cell proliferation, tumor invasion and
metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, and cancer stem cell differentiation (1–3). The biosynthesis of GAG starts by formation
of a linker tetrasaccharide (i.e., GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ14Xylβ-), which is further elongated by addition of repeating
disaccharides [e.g., -4GlcAβ1-4GlcNAcα1- for heparan sulfate
(HS) or -4GlcAβ1-3GalNAcβ1- for chondroitin sulfate/
dermatan sulfate (CS/DS)], followed by epimerization and
sulfation reactions, resulting in extensive structural diversity
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

Epigenetic modifications play a key role in cancer, and manipulating acetylation homeostasis of histones has lately attracted interest because of their effect on cell cycle regulation
and cell proliferation (4). Previous and recent studies show
nuclear localization of GAG chains (5, 6), interaction between
GAG chains and nucleosomal proteins (7), and involvement
of GAG, in particular highly sulfated HS, in histone acetylation (8). Exogenously supplied heparin and different HS variants have shown a marked effect on tumor growth and
metastasis (3), and several clinical trials studying the effect
of low molecular weight heparin in different cancer types
are currently in progress (9, 10).
Xylose is an unusual structural component in mammalian
cells and it serves as the linker between the protein and the
GAG chain in PG. However, β-D-xylosides containing various
hydrophobic aglycons can penetrate plasma membranes and
induce priming and formation of biologically active GAG
(11–19).
We have earlier reported that the xyloside 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl) β-D-xylopyranoside (XylNapOH), in contrast to
2-naphthyl β-D-xylopyranoside (XylNap; Fig. 1A), selectively
inhibits the growth of tumor cells in vitro as well as in vivo.
Whereas the selective inhibition by XylNapOH in vitro was
approximately 5-fold, in vivo treatment with this xyloside
reduced the average tumor load in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by 70% to 97% (15, 20). Priming of

HS synthesis was required for growth inhibition by XylNapOH
in vitro, and there was an accumulation of NO-generated
HS degradation products in the nuclei of tumor-derived
cells (20). The antiproliferative effect was also accompanied
by apoptosis (21).
To determine whether the HS products in the cell nuclei
were derived from xyloside-primed HS chains, we have synthesized 3H-labeled XylNapOH, as well as XylNap, with the 3H
in the C-1 position of the naphthol ring (see Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Fig. S2), and investigated the fate
of the GAG chains primed by these xylosides in human
lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) and bladder carcinoma T24 cells.
Furthermore, we have investigated the antiproliferative effect
of XylNapOH using a matched normal and tumor cell pair
from breast cancer patients as well as HFL-1 and T24 cells
in coculture models. We have also investigated the effect of
xylosides on histone H3 acetylation and apoptosis. Finally,
we tested the ability of XylNapOH to inhibit the growth of
C6 glioma cells in vitro and in vivo and propose that the antiproliferative effect of XylNapOH is caused by xyloside-primed
GAG chains produced by the cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culturing, radiolabeling, extraction, isolation of
xyloside-primed GAG chains, proliferation assay, and
immunoisolation of cellular compartments. The human
bladder carcinoma cell-line T24, human embryonic lung
fibroblasts (HFL-1), rat C6 glioma cells, breast cancer cells
from patients with infiltrative ductal cancer (HCC70 cells),
and normal fibroblasts from breast tissue of patients with
infiltrative ductal cancer (CCD-1095Sk cells) were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (LGC Promochem
AB) and cultured as described by the manufacturer. For
radiolabeling, confluent cells were incubated in low-sulfate,
MgCl2-labeling medium containing 50 μCi/mL of [35S]sulfate
(Perkin-Elmer) and 0.01 mmol/L xyloside and [3H]xyloside
(specific activity, 40 μCi/mL) for different time periods. Cell
extraction, isolation of xyloside-primed GAG chains, and
proliferation assay have been described previously (22).
Isolation of nuclei. Cells harvested by trypsinization were
suspended in 10 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/L DTT (pH 7.9) and incubated on ice for

5 minutes. The cells were then broken by 30 strokes using
the homogenizer Tissue-Tearor from BioSpec Products,
Inc., and then centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes. Pellets
containing enriched nuclei were resuspended in 0.25 mol/L
sucrose, 10 mmol/L MgCl2. The mixture was layered onto
an equal volume of a solution containing 0.35 mol/L sucrose,
0.5 mmol/L MgCl2 and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation
at 2,500 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C and lysed in 4 mol/L guanidinium chloride, 50 mmol/L sodium acetate. The radioactive content was determined in a β-counter.
Endocytosis assay. The assay was done as described previously (23). Different cellular compartments were isolated
by treating cell extracts with primary antibodies directed
against ER (rabbit anti-calnexin COOH-terminal polyclonal antibody from VWR International), Golgi (mouse
anti–Golgin-97 monoclonal antibody from Invitrogen
Corporation), clathrin (rabbit anti-clathrin polyclonal
antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caveolin-1
(mouse anti–caveolin-1 monoclonal antibody from BD
Biosciences), or early or late endosomes (rabbit Rab5 and
Rab7 polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
followed by addition of Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-rabbit
IgG for polyclonal primary antibodies and Dynabeads M-450
rat anti-mouse IgG1 for monoclonal primary antibodies
as magnetic secondary antibodies. The radioactivity in the
isolated compartments was determined in a β-counter.
Coculturing experiments. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, and T24 cells and HCC70 cells were seeded into
24-well plates at 50,000 per well and HFL-1 cells and CCD1095Sk cells were grown on polycarbonate membrane inserts
with pore size of 0.4 μm at 90,000 per well using their usual
culturing medium. After 24 hours, HFL-1 inserts were transferred to dishes with T24 cells and CCD-1095Sk inserts were
transferred to dishes with HCC70 cells, and the cocultures
were placed in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL insulin, 25 ng/mL transferrin, and
10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor and grown in the presence of various concentrations of XylNapOH for 72 hours.
Cells were then analyzed as described previously (22).
Measurement of histone H3 acetylation levels by immunofluorescence. The various procedures including seeding
of cells, fixation, and use of primary and secondary antibodies were the same as those used previously (23). Primary
antibody anti–acetyl histone H3 (Millipore), secondary
antibody Texas red–conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:500),
and DNA staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
were used as recommended by the manufacturers. The fluorescent images were analyzed by using a Carl Zeiss AxioObserver inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with
objective EC Plan-Neofluar 63×/1.25 Oil M27 and AxioCam
MRm Rev camera.
Measurement of histone H3 levels by immunoblot. Cell
lysis and acid extraction of proteins were done as described
for anti–histone H3 antibody by the manufacturer (Millipore). Samples containing ∼6 μg of protein were subjected
to SDS-PAGE on 4% to 12% gels followed by transfer onto
a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was
then blotted with 1:500 anti–histone H3 (Millipore) for

2 hours followed by 1:2,000 secondary antibody goat antirabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Promega). Bands were visualized by the chemiluminescence method according to the
manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). The membrane
was stripped and reprobed with α-tubulin antibody (1:500).
Detection of apoptotic cells using the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick-end labeling technique. T24 cells and HFL-1 cells were treated with
GAG chains isolated from the culture medium of T24
cells containing 100 times the amount of cells for a period
of 72 hours. Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was done
according to the manufacturer's instructions and has been
described in detail previously (22).
Animal experiments and tumor formation in vivo.
Female SCIDnodCA mice (7 ± 1 weeks old) were kept under
pathogen-free conditions in animal barrier facility at the Biomedical Center, Lund University, according to the Swedish
guidelines for humane treatment of laboratory animals.
The experimental setup was approved by the ethical committee for animal research in Malmö/Lund, Sweden. C6 glioma
cells (1 × 106 in 200 mL of PBS) were injected s.c. in the
dorsal region of 7 ± 1-week-old mice. Three days after injection, the animals were randomly divided into control and
treatment groups. Xyloside (1.7 mmol/L XylNapOH solution,
i.e., a saturated solution) was administered by daily s.c. injections of 0.15 or 0.5 mL in the neck for a total period of up to
2 weeks after tumor injection. Controls received daily injections of sterile PBS. Food and water intake and changes
in body weight were monitored. The animals were sacrificed
after 2 weeks of treatment, and tumor mass was recorded.
The presented results include nine animals in the control
group, nine animals in the group treated with 0.5 mL of
XylNapOH, and four animals in the group treated with
0.15 mL of XylNapOH.
Chemistry. 2-Naphthyl 2,3,4-tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-xylopyranoside (24) and 2-(6-acetoxy-naphthyl) 2,3,4-tetra-O-acetylβ-D-xylopyranoside (25) were iodinated using In(OTf)3/ICl
in acetonitrile, deacetylated using standard Zemplén conditions, and radioactively labeled by hydrodehalogenation
using tritium gas, performed at Active Biotech AB (Lund,
Sweden).

Results
Nuclear localization of xyloside-primed GAG chains. To
investigate nuclear localization of xyloside-primed GAG
chains, HFL-1 and T24 cells were treated with [3H]XylNapOH
or [3H]XylNap and [35S]sulfate for 24 hours and the cell nuclei were isolated using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Accumulation of radiolabeled GAG chains was detected in the
nuclei of T24 cells incubated with [3H]XylNapOH (Fig. 1B). In
contrast, almost no GAG chains were detected in the nuclei
of HFL-1 cells, nor in cells treated with [3H]XylNap.
Size-separation chromatography on Superose 6 of the [3H]
XylNapOH-primed GAG chains isolated from the nuclei of
T24 cells showed accumulation of medium-sized, mostly
[35S]sulfate-labeled polydisperse material with an estimated

size range of 20 to 60 kDa (fractions 30–45), as well as
shorter, mainly 3H-labeled chains (fractions 50–60; Fig. 1C).
The shorter chains were further size-separated on Superdex
peptide and found to consist of saccharides ranging from dito decasaccharide, indicating the presence of sulfated oligosaccharides carrying the labeled aglycon in the nuclei of T24
cells (Fig. 1D, fractions 25–35).

Biosynthesis of xyloside-primed GAG chains. To determine the origin of the xyloside-primed GAG chains and oligosaccharides, we investigated their biosynthesis. HFL-1 and
T24 cells were thus treated with [3H]XylNapOH or [3H]XylNap in the presence of [35S]sulfate for various time periods
and xyloside-primed GAG chains were isolated from the culture medium and cell extracts and from compartments of the

secretory pathway. Most of the xyloside-primed GAG chains
were secreted into the culture medium and accumulation
over time was observed in both cell lines (Fig. 2A–D). The
total amount of secreted GAG chains from T24 cells treated
with [3H]XylNapOH was low (Fig. 2B) compared to similarly
treated HFL-1 cells (Fig. 2A), as well as to cells treated with
[ 3 H]XylNap (Fig. 2C and D). The size of the XylNapOHprimed GAG chains secreted by HFL-1 and T24 cells during
24 hours was examined using size-separation chromatography on Superose 6 and Superdex peptide (Fig. 2E–H). In
agreement with previous results, both HFL-1 and T24 cells
secreted free medium-sized heterogeneous sulfated GAG
chains with an estimated size of 30 to 50 kDa (see bar I in
Fig. 2E and F; ref. 20). In addition, HFL-1 and T24 cells
secreted large amounts of short, relatively low-sulfated,
3
H-labeled, and thus xyloside-carrying oligosaccharides. The
oligosaccharides secreted by T24 cells were more sulfated
than those secreted by HFL-1 cells (fractions II in Fig. 2E
and F). Chromatography on Superdex peptide indicated
that the oligosaccharides ranged in size from di- to decasaccharide (Fig. 2G and H).
In the cell extracts of T24 and HFL-1 cells, we observed an
increasing intracellular accumulation of 3H- and [35S]sulfatelabeled XylNapOH-primed GAG chains over time, reaching
a maximum after 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, the accumulation of GAG chains was greater in T24
cells compared with HFL-1 cells. The subcellular localization of the xyloside-primed GAG chains during transport
through the secretory pathway was investigated by immunomagnetic isolation of ER and Golgi from cells treated with
[3H]XylNapOH and [35S]sulfate. The amount of radiolabeled
material in ER and Golgi increased slowly over time, indicating localization to the secretory pathway organelles (Supplementary Fig. S3). No differences were detected between
the two cell types, and no differences were found between
XylNap and XylNapOH (results not shown).
Uptake of xyloside-primed GAG chains. As we had detected relatively lower amounts of XylNapOH-primed GAG
chains in the culture medium of T24 cells and correspondingly higher amounts inside cells and also in the nuclei compared with HFL-1 cells, we explored whether xyloside-primed
GAG chains, secreted into the culture medium, could undergo re-internalization. Thus, HFL-1 and T24 cells were exposed to xyloside-primed GAG chains isolated from the
culture medium of the corresponding cell type (i.e., HFL1→HFL-1 and T24→T24). Higher uptake of T24-derived [3H]
XylNapOH-primed GAG chains was detected in T24 cells
compared with uptake of HFL-1-derived GAG chains by
HFL-1 cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no uptake of [3H]XylNapprimed GAG chains was detected in any of the cell types.
To investigate if the uptake of XylNapOH-primed GAG
chains was cell specific, T24 cells were treated with [3H]XylNapOH-primed GAG chains produced by HFL-1 cells, and
HFL-1 cells with corresponding GAG chains produced by
T24 cells (i.e., T24→HFL-1 and HFL-1→T24). Interestingly, this
cross-experiment showed that HFL-1 cells internalized large
amounts of xyloside-primed GAG chains produced by T24
cells, whereas T24 cells took up much less of xyloside-primed

for 24 h. B, XylNapOH-primed GAG chains isolated from the culture
media of HFL-1 and T24 cells were incubated with the opposite cell type
for 24 h. Uptake was expressed as the amount of radioactivity in the
total cell extracts and normalized for cell number. C, uptake by T24 cells

T24 cells into different cellular compartments, analyzed by measuring
the amount of radioactivity in the isolated compartments after 24 h

GAG chains produced by HFL-1 cells (Fig. 3B). These results
indicate that T24 cells, treated with the antiproliferative
XylNapOH, secrete xyloside-primed GAG chains that can be
internalized by both normal and transformed cells.
To investigate the mechanism of uptake of [3H]XylNapOHprimed GAG chains, clathrin- and caveolin-1–containing
compartments and early and late endosomes were isolated
from [3H]XylNapOH- and [35S]sulfate-treated T24 cells using
an immunomagnetic method and the radioactive content was

measured. Both clathrin- and caveolin-1–containing compartments and early and late endosomes contained
radiolabeled GAG chains (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, treatment
with the macropinocytosis inhibitor amiloride (5.0 μmol/L)
had no effect on the uptake (data not shown). Taken together,
these results indicate involvement of both classic and nonclassic pathways in the uptake of XylNapOH-primed GAG
chains and further transport to early and late endosomes.
Antiproliferative effect of XylNapOH-primed GAG
chains. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, T24 cells treated with
the antiproliferative XylNapOH secrete xyloside-primed
GAG chains that can be internalized by both normal and
transformed cells. To establish that the antiproliferative effect of XylNapOH was mediated by XylNapOH-primed GAG
chains secreted by cancer cells, we investigated the growth of
HFL-1 cells and T24 cells in the presence of GAG chains produced by T24 cells. These GAG chains suppressed the growth
of both HFL-1 cells and T24 cells, indicating that the antiproliferative activity was exerted by XylNapOH-primed GAG
chains produced by T24 cells (Fig. 4A). We also investigated
the antiproliferative effect of XylNapOH in cocultures of
HFL-1 and T24 cells and HFL-1 and HFL-1 cells where cells
shared culture medium (i.e., xyloside and xyloside-primed
GAG chains). Whereas treatment with XylNapOH inhibited
the growth of HFL-1 cells that grew in coculture with T24
cells (Fig. 4B, solid line; ED50, 150 μmol/L), there was little
growth inhibition when HFL-1 cells were cocultured with
HFL-1 cells (Fig. 4B, dotted line).
To confirm the selective antiproliferative effect of
XylNapOH, we also used a matched cell pair, HCC70 breast
cancer cells and CCD-1095Sk fibroblasts from middle aged
breast tissue of patients with infiltrative ductal cancer. After
exposure to 70 μmol/L XylNapOH for 96 hours, HCC70
cells were totally growth inhibited, whereas CCD-1095Sk
fibroblasts were not growth affected (data not shown). A
comparison of the ED50 values obtained after 96 hours of
exposure indicated that HCC70 breast cancer cells were

almost three times more sensitive than CCD-1095Sk fibroblasts to XylNapOH treatment (ED50, 37.5 and 120 μmol/L, respectively). We also investigated the antiproliferative effect of
XylNapOH in cocultures of HCC70 cells and CCD-1095Sk cells
wherein both cell types shared the culture medium. Treatment
with XylNapOH inhibited the growth of CCD-1095Sk cells that
grew in coculture with HCC70 cells (Fig. 4C, solid line; ED50,
120 μmol/L). However, there was little growth inhibition in
cocultures of normal CCD-1095Sk cells (Fig. 4C, dotted line).
Taken together, these results indicate that the antiproliferative effect of XylNapOH is mediated by XylNapOH-primed
GAG chains secreted by cancer cells. These GAG chains can
be taken up by both normal and cancer cells, transported to
the nuclei where they inhibit cell proliferation.
XylNapOH treatment lowers the acetylation of histone
H3 in cancer cells. It was recently shown that GAG chains
inhibit the activity of histone acetyltransferase and thereby decrease the acetylation of histone H3 in different cells (8). To
determine the effect of xyloside-primed GAG chains on
histone H3 acetylation, T24, HCC70, HFL-1, and CCD-1095Sk
cells were treated with XylNapOH, and the effect on acetylation of histone H3 was studied by immunostaining using anti–
acetyl histone H3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment
with XylNapOH suppressed the acetylation of histone H3 in
T24 and HCC70 cells, whereas no effect was detected in
HFL-1 cells and CCD-1095Sk cells. To investigate if the effect
on histone H3 acetylation was specific for XylNapOH, we studied the effect of XylNap. Interestingly, treatment with XylNap
had no effect on the acetylation level of histone H3 in T24 cells,
indicating that the effect was specific for XylNapOH. We
then investigated the level of total histone H3 in untreated
and XylNapOH-treated cells by Western blot. As shown in
Fig. 5A, XylNapOH treatment did not appreciably affect the
level of histone H3, indicating that expression of histone H3
was not affected by XylNapOH.
Acetylation of histone H3 is tightly involved in cell cycle
regulation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (26). To explore

mass (n = 9; P < 0.001). D, summary of results. Tumor selectivity by formation of antiproliferative GAG chains by cancer cells. a, xylosides such as
XylNapOH can enter both normal (blue) and tumor cells (pink). b, the xylosides serve as primers for the synthesis of soluble GAG chains. GAG chains
are secreted from both cell types. c, the GAG chains produced by tumor cells (pink) are taken up and transported to the nuclei of both cell types and
induce apoptosis. The GAG chains from normal cells (blue) are not taken up or transported to the cell nuclei of either cell type. d, in vivo, the antiproliferative
GAG chains secreted from the tumor cells form a gradient around the tumor (pink). The GAG chains will be rapidly taken up by neighboring cells (i.e.,
mainly cancer cells), which explains the tumor-selective effect.

whether the antiproliferative xyloside-primed GAG chains
elicited apoptosis, TUNEL assay detecting DNA fragmentation was done on HFL-1 and T24 cells treated with antiproliferative XylNapOH-primed GAG chains produced by T24
cells. Treatment with such GAG chains induced apoptosis
in both HFL-1 and T24 cells (Fig. 5B).
In vivo antitumor effects of XylNapOH. We have previously shown that treatment with XylNapOH, s.c., for a period
of 3 weeks reduced the growth of T24 cells in a tumor model
by 97% without any adverse side effects (20). In this study,
we also investigated the antiproliferative effect of XylNapOH
on C6 glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment with
XylNapOH had a moderate inhibitory effect on the growth of
C6 glioma cells compared with HFL-1 cells (i.e., the ED50 value
was 420 μmol/L for C6 glioma cells versus 500 μmol/L for
HFL-1 cells). To investigate the effect of XylNapOH on the
growth of C6 glioma tumors in vivo, a subcutaneous tumor
model was established in female severe combined immunodeficiency SCIDnodCA mice. C6 glioma cells formed subcutaneous tumors that were clearly palpable after 10 to 14 days of
inoculation. In the experiments, daily s.c. injections of xyloside
(0.15 and 0.5 mL, 1.7 mmol/L XylNapOH, i.e., a saturated solution) was initiated 3 days after tumor inoculation and continued for a period of 2 weeks. No adverse effects were observed
in the treated mice (i.e., no toxic symptoms or loss in body
weight). As shown in Fig. 5C, the tumor load was reduced by
increasing the concentrations of xyloside and the average tumor load was significantly reduced in mice treated with 0.5 mL
of XylNapOH as compared with the control group (P < 0.001).

Discussion
The present results show that T24 cells treated with
XylNapOH secrete xyloside-primed GAG chains that are internalized via both clathrin- and caveolin-dependent pathways
and appear in late endosomes and the nucleus. XylNapOHprimed GAG chains produced by T24 cells were taken up by
both HFL-1 and T24 cells and exerted antiproliferative activity
by induction of apoptosis in both cell types. Normal HFL-1
cells also secreted xyloside-primed GAG chains but these
chains were not internalized and had no antiproliferative activity. Likewise, XylNap-primed GAG chains produced by T24
cells were not internalized and were inactive. Similar results
were obtained using a breast cancer cell line where XylNapOH
selectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Moreover, in coculture experiments, both normal and cancer cells were growth
inhibited when XylNapOH was added to the shared medium.
The origin and type of cells and the nature of the xyloside
aglycon may play an important role in the formation of specific GAG structures. Previous studies have shown that the
structure of the aglycon moiety and the concentration of
the xyloside primers influence the nature and composition
of the produced GAG chains (27). Recently, Kuberan and
coworkers showed that the aglycon moiety of xylosides may
influence the extent of sulfation, the sulfation pattern, the
disaccharide composition, and the chain length of the primed
GAG chains (28). Furthermore, the structure of PG/GAG
varies in different normal and tumor cells, and GAG chain

structure affects cell proliferation and tumor phenotype (1).
Fibroblasts may not be a perfect control for epitheliumderived breast cancer cells because the PG/GAG composition
of fibroblasts is different from that of epithelium-derived
breast cancer cells, with a higher CS/DS presentation in fibroblasts. However, fibroblasts are the major stroma cells in the
breast tissue surrounding the cancer cells and can therefore
be an appropriate control for breast cancer cells.
Nuclear localization of HS-PG and HS-GAG chains has
been shown earlier (5, 6, 29, 30), but the nuclear transportation pathway is poorly understood. It was recently reported
that heparanase, a HS-cleaving enzyme highly expressed by
many tumor types (31), affects gene expression with downstream signals that promote the aggressive tumor phenotype.
This effect is associated with downregulation of the level of
nuclear HS (29). Other studies have shown interaction between HS chains and nucleosomal histone proteins (7) and
inhibition of histone acetyltransferases by HS chains, in particular highly sulfated HS oligosaccharides of 14 to 16 sugars
in length, indicating the involvement of HS in cell cycle and
cell proliferation (8). Here, we show that XylNapOH treatment lowers the level of histone H3 acetylation selectively
in T24 bladder carcinoma and HCC70 breast carcinoma cells
without affecting the expression of histone H3. Moreover, we
show that treatment of T24 carcinoma cells with XylNap
has no effect on histone H3 acetylation, indicating that the
aglycon structure and the structure of xyloside-primed
GAG chains play an important role in this process. Furthermore, we observed that high molecular weight xylosideprimed GAG chains are more abundant in HFL-1 cells
compared with T24 cells (see Fig. 2E and F, void volume fraction to fraction 30). This may be due to higher expression of
endoheparanase in T24 cells, which induces degradation of
high molecular weight GAG chains to smaller molecules that
subsequently accumulate in the nuclei and inhibit cell proliferation by downregulating histone H3 acetylation, resulting
in repression of transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation
regulates such processes as gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair (32). However, the mechanism for the
so-called “deposition acetylation” of the core histones H3
and H4 and the mechanism for the nuclear import of
these histones seem to be complicated. It has been shown
that negatively charged HS binds to nucleosomes via the
positively charged NH2 termini of histones (7). To what
extent XylNapOH treatment affects the activity of histone
acetyltransferase or histone deacetylase or the transport of
histones to the nucleus remains to be elucidated.
Using a C6 glioma tumor model, we show that s.c. treatment with XylNapOH inhibits tumor growth in vivo by 73%
despite moderate selectivity in vitro. Past and present results
thus suggest that the prodrug XylNapOH, when taken up by
tumor cells, primes the synthesis and secretion of antiproliferative GAG chains, most likely of the HS type, as shown
previously (20). These HS-GAG are taken up by both normal
and tumor cells, processed by NO-dependent degradation,
and transported to the nuclei where they induce growth inhibition via apoptosis. Because such HS-GAG chains seem to
be secreted only by the tumor cells, they accumulate in the

immediate vicinity of the tumor, forming a concentration
gradient around the tumor. The GAG chains will therefore
preferentially be taken up by the tumor cells as well as
stroma cells, which may explain the selective effects shown
in vivo (Fig. 5D). In tumor cells, the GAG chains suppress
acetylation of histone H3 without affecting the expression
of histone H3.
In summary, by using synthetic xylosides, we can induce
generation of antiproliferative GAG chains by cancer cells.
These GAG chains modulate the acetylation level of histone
H3 and thereby influence various cell functions, including
proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and carcinogenesis.
Drugs able to regulate the histone-modifying enzymes
are becoming very promising tools for the treatment of
several diseases, including cancer (26). Our findings show a
novel mechanism for selective killing of tumor cells and point

toward new, more effective polysaccharide-based antitumor
therapies.
