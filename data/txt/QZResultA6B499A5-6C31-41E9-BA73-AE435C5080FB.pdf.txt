ABSTRACT
A phosphine copper(I) complex [Cu(thp)4][PF6] (CP) was recently identified as
an efficient in vitro antitumor agent. In this study, we evaluated the antiproliferative
activity of CP in leukemia cell lines finding a significant efficacy, especially against
SEM and RS4;11 cells. Immunoblot analysis showed the activation of caspase-12
and caspase-9 and of the two effector caspase-3 and -7, suggesting that cell
death occurred in a caspase-dependent manner. Interestingly we did not observe
mitochondrial involvement in the process of cell death. Measures on semipurified
proteasome from RS4;11 and SEM cell extracts demonstrated that chymotrypsin-,
trypsin- and caspase-like activity decreased in the presence of CP. Moreover, we
found an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and a remarkable increase of
ER stress markers: GRP78, CHOP, and the spliced form of XBP1. Accordingly, the
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide significantly protected cancer cells from
CP-induced cell death, suggesting that protein synthesis machinery was involved. In
well agreement with results obtained on stabilized cell lines, CP induced ER-stress
and apoptosis also in primary cells from B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.
Importantly, we showed that the combination of CP with some chemotherapeutic
drugs displayed a good synergy that strongly affected the survival of both RS4;11
and SEM cells.

INTRODUCTION

activator of UPR is the chaperon GRP78 which functions
as a inhibitor of three ER transmembrane receptors:
(PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme
1 (IRE1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) [3].
On misfolded proteins accumulation, GRP78 is required
to target proteins for degradation and its release from ER
membrane allows the activation of the three receptors.
Initially, PERK is activated to block protein synthesis,
followed by ATF6 to restore ER homeostasis and finally,
IRE1 is activated with function of UPR mediator but also
of ER stress-apoptosis inducer [4].
Misfolded proteins are ubiquitinated by the
endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation

Many studies have shown that several
chemotherapeutics drive cell death through the activation
of ER stress. Thus, strategies that promote ER stress prodeath function or inhibit its prosurvival activity could be
useful in cancer therapy [1, 2].
In response to ER stress and accumulation of
unfolded proteins, cells activate a process known as
Unfolding Protein Response (UPR). UPR integrates
many signalling pathways to restore ER stability through
the attenuation of protein synthesis and the upregulation
of chaperones that facilitate protein folding. The main

system (ERAD) and degraded by proteasome thus
reducing the toxic effects induced by protein aggregation
[5]. However, alterations or pharmacological inhibition
of ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) prevent misfolded
proteins degradation leading to ER stress condition [6].
Sustained and unsolved ER stress switches signalling from
pro-survival UPR to cell death, via IRE-1. In turn, IRE1 mediates the splicing of the transcription factor XBP-1
and the activation of the transcription factor CHOP (C/
EBP-homologous protein), which ultimately drives the
cell to apoptosis. The overload of ER-folding environment
could also induces the apoptotic machinery through the
activation of ER-resident caspase-12 [7, 8].
However, despite many studies, ER stressinduced cell death is not a well known process [2] and
several mechanisms of programmed cell death, such as
paraptosis, autophagy and apoptosis, have been described
as consequence of prolonged ER stress [2, 9-11].
Recently, a novel phosphine copper(I) complex
[Cu(thp)4][PF6] (CP) was found to have a marked in vitro
antiproliferative activity against different human solid
tumours, whereas it poorly affected non-tumour cells
[12, 13]. The cytotoxic effect of CP in colon cancer cells
has been correlated to the induction of a programmed
non-apototic mechanism of cell death, called paraptosis
or type III cell death [13]. Paraptosis lacks of apoptotic
morphology, caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation
and it is characterized by the massive presence of large
vacuoles derived from endoplasmic reticulum, after the
alteration of ER homeostasis [14]. Many studies show
that copper complexes induce a disruption of proteasomeER functional link through the inhibition of proteasome
and the accumulation of misfolded proteins [15-17]. In
particular, it has been demonstrated that, on colon cancer
cells, the antiproliferative activity of CP is associated
to functional suppression of the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway and to the induction of ER stress [13].
Up to now, very few works have described the
effects of copper complexes on blood cancers and as
concern CP only studies on solid tumors have been
developed.
However, proteasome inhibitors such as Bortezomib,
MG-132 and PS-341 are widely studied in haematological
malignancy and seem very effective in inducing apoptosis.
Moreover, many in vivo studies have demonstrated
the efficacy of these compounds in combination with
other chemotherapeutics. [18,19] Since the potential
of proteasome inhibitors in leukemia treatment and the
promising activity of CP on colon cancer cells, in this
report we investigated CP effects on childhood leukemia
cells.
We showed that CP had a strong growth inhibitory
activity on several leukemia cell lines of different lineage
and phenotype and it preferentially killed B-lymphoblastic
leukemia cells. This cytotoxic activity was mediated by
the induction of ER stress as a consequence of proteasome
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.
Differently from what assessed in colon cancer cells,
ER stress induced by CP triggered a caspase-dependent
apoptotic program. More importantly, the association of
CP with some chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used
in therapy displayed a remarkable synergy that strongly
affected the survival of both RS4;11 and SEM B-ALL
cells.

RESULTS
CP induces growth inhibition in leukemia cell
lines
[Cu(thp)4][PF6] (CP) was evaluated for its growth
inhibition activity on a panel of twelve different human
leukemia cell lines (five B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
three T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, three acute
myeloid leukemia and one chronic myeloid leukemia).
Cells were treated for 72 h with CP and cell viability
was evaluated by MTT test. CP significantly inhibited
leukemia cells growth with a GI50 ranging from 1.2 µM
to 23 µM for myeloid phenotypes, between 3.9 µM and
16.7 µM for T-lymphoblastic phenotypes and from 0.9
µM to 4.2 µM for B-lymphoblastic cell lines (Table 1). In
contrast, on both resting and PHA stimulated peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors,
and on CD19+ isolated cells, the GI50 was generally
higher than that on leukemia cells, suggesting that CP
preferentially killed leukemia cells with a moderate
selectivity toward B-lymphoblastic phenotype. Kumatori
et al. [20] previously demonstrated that in malignant
hematopoietic cells the expression of proteasome is at
least 10 times higher that in lymphocytes and monocytes
from healthy donors. This abnormal high expression of
proteasomal proteins and mRNA seem to be correlated
to the hyperproliferation of these cancer cells and to the
sensitivity towards proteasome inhibitors [19,20].
Evaluated in the same experimental conditions,
the inorganic salts CuCl and CuCl2 only induced a slight
reduction of cell viability in all cell lines at concentration
>250 µM (data not shown), pointing out the role of
phosphine ligands in the cytotoxic action of CP.
Given the high efficacy of CP against B-leukemia
phenotype and the bad prognosis of 4;11 translocated
B-ALL, we further investigated the mechanism of action
and the death pathways activated by CP in RS4;11 and
SEM cells.

Cellular uptake of CP is increased in B-leukemia
cell lines

of CP with its cellular uptake, the intracellular copper

content was evaluated in RS4;11, SEM, Jurkat and THP-1
cell lines and PBMC from healthy donors treated for 24
h with increasing concentrations of CP. The intracellular
copper amount (Figure 1, panel A) was quantified by
GF-AAS analysis (Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption
Spectrometry). Treatment of both leukemic cells with
CP resulted in a marked increase of copper intracellular
content in comparison with healthy PBMC. The higher
uptake of CP in leukemic cells could be correlated with the
higher cytotoxicity displayed by CP in this type of acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines compared to healthy
PBMC, supporting the better selectivity of CP towards
cancer cells.

Many types of cell death are commonly induced in
cancer cells: apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, necroptosis
and paraptosis. Recent studies showed that copper (I) and
copper (II) complexes can induce paraptosis, a caspaseindependent programmed cell death [15-17].
To characterize the mode of cell death induced
by CP, we performed a cytofluorimetric analysis
using PI and Annexin-V-FITC, which stain DNA and
phosphatidylserine residues, respectively. After a time
course of 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h of drug treatment (2.5
µM), SEM and RS4;11 cells were labeled with the two
dyes and analyzed by flow cytometry. Starting from 6 h
of treatment, we observed the appearance of significant
levels of Annexin-V positive cells, that further increased
at 12 and 24 h, in both cell lines, suggesting that apoptosis
was induced by CP (Figure 1, panel C).
To determine whether the apoptotic stimuli involved
mitochondria alteration, we examined the mitochondrial
transmembrane potential (∆Ψmt) by means of the
fluorescence dye JC-1. Cytofluorimetric analysis was
performed on RS4;11 and SEM cells after different times
of treatment, finding that the percentage of cells with low
∆Ψmt slightly increased, only after 12 h (Figure 2, panel
A). Moreover, further cytometric analysis did not reveal

Analysis of the CP effects on the cell cycle
The effects of different concentrations of CP on cell
cycle progression were examined in RS4;11 and SEM
cells after 24 h of treatment. Flow cytometric analyses
revealed that CP did not affect cell cycle in these two
cell lines (Figure 1, panel B) but more importantly, we
observed a concentration-dependent increase of the cell
population with a hypodiploid DNA content peak (subG1),
which is usually considered as apoptotic cells, suggesting
that CP may induce apoptosis (Figure 1, panel B).

cytochrome c release, suggesting that MMP depletion was
not involved in the apoptotic process (Figure 2, panel B).
We therefore evaluated whether the inhibition
of caspases with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk
would prevent cell death. Our results assessed by MTT
analysis showed that z-VAD.fmk significantly increased
cell viability, suggesting that CP-induced cell death was
mostly mediated by caspase-dependent apoptosis (Figure
2, panel C).
Concerning the involved caspases, immunoblot
analysis (Figure 2, panel D) demonstrated the activation of
caspase-9 and the cleavage of the two effector caspase-3
and -7 starting from 6 h of treatment, in agreement with
the appearance of annexin-V positive cells described

above. Accordingly, we also found, again just after 6 h
of treatment, the cleavage of caspase-3 substrate PARP, a
classical feature of apoptosis [21-23].
As a previous work, carried out by some of us,
which showed ER stress involvement in the activation of
cell death program induced by CP [13], we evaluated the
activation of the ER-resident caspase-12. Many studies
pointed out the central role exerted by caspase-12 in
ER-stress induced apoptosis [7,8, 24,25]. Following its
activation, caspase-12 migrates from ER to the cytosol and
can directly process caspase-9, which in turn induces the
activation of the apoptotic program, without cytochrome
c involvement [8]. Starting from 1.5 h of CP treatment,
in RS4;11 and from 3 h in SEM cell lines, we found the

activation of caspase-12 prior to the activation of all the
other caspases, suggesting that the process triggering
apoptosis could start from an ER impairment.
Furthermore, a decrease in the expression of the
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was detectable at least
after 3 h of treatment and this correlates with an early
commitment to apoptosis (Figure 2, panel D).

Previous observations indicated that in colon
cancer cells CP may induce functional suppression of
the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway inhibiting all the
proteolytic activity of the proteasome [13]. The 26S
proteasome is a multicatalytic protease responsible for the

regulated intracellular protein degradation. Its function is
mediated by three main catalytic activities i) chymotrypsin
like (CT) ii) Trypsin-like (T) and iii) peptidyl glutamyl
peptide hydrolyzing (PGPH). To evaluate the effect
of CP on the proteasome activity in leukemia cells,
we tested increasing concentrations of the compound
on semipurified 26S proteasome extract from RS4;11
and SEM cells, and measured the functioning of each
individual proteolytic activity under cell-free condition.

Both in RS4;11 and SEM cells (Figure 3, panels A and B),
CP inhibited all the proteolytic activities with IC50 values
of about 15, 12 and 16 µM in SEM and 18, 11 and 10 µM
in RS4;11 for CT, T and PGPH activity, respectively.
In normal conditions, misfolded proteins in the ER
are driven to the cytoplasm, where upon ubiquitination,
are degraded by the proteasome system. Proteasome
inhibitors have been shown to induce an accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins in the cytoplasm and ER stress.[1]

FIGURE 3: CP treatment affects Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS). 26S proteasome (100 µg) semipurified from (A) SEM

To assess if CP worked as other proteasome inhibitors,
we evaluated the accumulation of ubiquitin after 1.5, 3,
and 6 h of treatment. Immunoblot analysis (Figure 3,
panel C) revealed that CP induced the accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins starting from 1.5 h in SEM and 3
h in RS4;11 cells.

apoptosis induced by CP. Moreover, in unresolvable
stress conditions, an increased CHOP expression has been
correlated to the induction of the expression of many
apoptotic genes and to the down-regulation prosurvival
genes, such as Bcl-2 [30]. Indeed, as showed above, we
found a decrease in Bcl-2 protein (Figure 2, panel D)
following CHOP activation. In addition we observed that
CP induced XBP1 splicing in both cell lines (Figure 4,
panel C).

lines

CP-induced apoptosis is mediated by ER stress

To evaluate if CP effects on proteasome activity lead
to ER stress, we evaluated the expression of ER stress
marker GRP78, CHOP and the splicing of XBP1 in CPtreated RS4;11 and SEM cells [26,27].
Western blot analyses demonstrated a remarkable
increase of GRP78 expression after 6 h of treatment in
SEM and after 12 h in RS4;11(Figure 4, panels A and
B). Moreover we found an increase in CHOP expression
starting from 3 h of CP treatment. Interestingly, the CHOP
increased expression was detectable earlier than the
induction of GRP78. Whilst GRP78, due to its chaperon
activity, exerts a protective function, CHOP promotes
ER-stress cell death [28,29], thus the rapid activation of
pro-death signals and the late activation of pro-survival
chaperone GRP78 could explain the commitment toward

To investigate if proteasome inhibition and ER
stress could be responsible for CP-induced cell death, we
assayed apoptosis and ER stress markers in the presence
of cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis
that antagonizes ER-stress agents [24]. The inhibition of
protein synthesis reduced the accumulation of unfolded
proteins in the ER and therefore ER-stress induced
apoptosis.
As shown in Figure 5, panels A and B, the
Annexin-V/PI assay revealed that CHX effected a
significant protection from CP induced cell death and
a significant reduction of caspase-3 cleavage, in both
RS4;11 and SEM cells. Furthermore, CHX induced a

On the other hand, treatment of patient cells with
CP (2.5 µM) for 12 h induced caspase-3 activation and
PARP cleavage confirming the onset of caspase-dependent
apoptosis also on B-lymphoblastic leukemia primary
cells (Figure 6, panel C). Moreover, monitoring GRP-78
and CHOP expression in primary cultures, a significant
increase in the expression of both these markers was
found, indicating ER-stress response, as observed in RS
4;11 and SEM cell lines (Figure 6, panel C).

SEM and RS4;11 cell lines were exposed to
dexamethasone (Dex), daunorubicine (Dauno), cytarabine
(Ara-C) and vincristine (Vcr) in the presence or absence
of CP, at fixed combination ratios. Table 2 summarizes
the results of drug combinations analysed by Chou and
Talalay method [32]. In both cell lines, CP increased the
antiproliferative effects of all the drugs in a synergistic
way, in particular at high effect levels (GI75, GI90) that
represent the most therapeutically relevant conditions for
cancer therapy [33]. We found a very strong synergism
(CI<0.1) in the case of CP-Dex and CP-Vcr combination
in both cell lines, and by combining CP with CP-AraC
in SEM cells (Table 2). It is important to note that the
effect of CP promoted a synergistic cytotoxic effect when
administered with chemotherapeutic drugs endowed
with different mechanisms of action, suggesting that
the induction of ER-stress, could be potentially useful
in clinical therapy to optimize the efficacy of existing
therapies for B-leukemias.

alternative form of programmed cell death characterized
by cytoplasmic vacuolization, mitochondrial swelling and
the absence of caspase activation [10].
In this study, we demonstrated that CP is effective
also in leukemic cells with a growth inhibitory activity
comparable and in some cases even higher than that
observed in colorectal cancer cells. The cytotoxic
activity on healthy lymphocytes was 5-10 fold lower than
B-leukemia cells, suggesting a preferential cytotoxicity
versus this lineage of neoplastic cells. This finding may
be related to the higher CP intracellular content observed
in RS4;11 and SEM B-cells compared to healthy PBMC.
Herein we demonstrated that, in RS4;11 and SEM
B-leukemia cell lines, CP induced the accumulation
of ubiquitinated proteins and ER stress through the
inhibition of proteasome system and suppression of
protein degradation. The inhibition of protein synthesis
by CHX protected cells from the effect deriving from CP
treatment, supporting the hypothesis of UPS impairment
and ER stress induced cell death.
Besides activating apoptotic pathways, ER stress is
also known to trigger survival signals by increasing the
expression of pro-survival UPR components such as the
chaperon GRP78. In this context, it has recently reported
that GRP78 is highly expressed in response to ER stress
stimuli and may play an important role in cell survival of
leukemic cells [34-36].

CP is a monocationic copper (I) complex that
was found to be an effective antiproliferative agent in
colon cancer cells through the impairment of ubiquitin/

Our data revealed, upon treatment with CP, an
early activation of the proapoptotic transcription factor
CHOP, a well-known marker of ER-stress, and this
activation closely correlated with the appearance of
Annexin-V positive cells, the activation of caspases and
downregulation of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2. It has
been shown that prolonged high expression levels of
CHOP led ER-stress to a proapototic cell fate, despite the
activation of the pro-survival chaperon GRP78 [28,29].
The increase of both CHOP and GRP78 consequent to CP
treatment suggests that CP led a sustained activation of
ER-stress, that was able to overcome GRP78 protective
mechanisms that occurred later than CHOP activation,
thus promoting the induction of apoptotic cascade.
Differently from colon cancer cells, where the
activation of ER stress by CP led to paraptosis, in
B-lymphoblastic leukemia cells it triggered a caspasedependent apoptosis as demonstrated by the significant
increase of cell viability in the presence of the pancaspase
inhibitor z-VAD.fmk. Moreover, the cleavage of
both caspase-9 and caspase-3 as well as caspase-7
unequivocally confirmed the activation of the apoptotic
process. Interestingly, CP treatment only slightly increased
mitochondrial depolarization and didn’t cause cytochrome
c release, suggesting that the mitochondrial pathway was
not involved or, at least it did not play a major role. It
is worth to note that mitochondria-independent cell death
has been described to mediate apoptosis in response to ER
stress induced by different stimuli [37,38].
The accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and
the persistent ER stress primed death signals from the
ER stress sensors and the activation of the ER-resident
caspase-12. The discovery of an ER-localized caspase-12
has brought into question the mechanism by which ER
stress activates caspases and trigger apoptosis. In vitro
active caspase-12 is able to directly cleave caspase-9
which subsequentially activates caspase-3, potentially
eliminating the requirements of the mitochondria and
the apoptosome to perform ER-stress induced apoptosis
[7,8]. This mechanism of action has been observed in
C2C12 cells treated with known ER-stress inducers such
as thapsigargin and tunicamycin where caspase-9 could
be processed by caspase-12 in an Apaf-1/cytochrome c
independent manner [8]. Although this mechanism was
observed in murine myoblasts, a large number of studies
carried out in human cells have indicated that caspase-12
may be activated by ER stress consequent to different
causes, including anticancer drugs [39-44]. Consistent
with these observations, our results showing the early
cleavage of caspase-12 prior to caspase-9 and caspase-3
activation, suggested the direct involvement of caspase-12
in initiating the apoptotic program.
The strong ability of CP to induce cell growth
inhibition and apoptosis response was also confirmed
in ex-vivo B-leukemia cell culture. The activation of
ER-stress markers suggested a link between cell death
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and unfolded protein response and ER-stress overload
also in primary cells. Another important aspect of our
study, is that CP exhibits a strong significative effect in
killing leukemic cells in association with many of the
chemotherapeutics currently used in therapy. Leukemic
cells and in general cancer cells are characterized by
enhanced activation of pro-survival pathways that may
protect cells from stress induced by chemotherapeutic
agents. It is possible that CP sensitizes cancer cells by an
overload of ER stress condition able to improve leukemia
cell death in a synergistic way. It is worthwhile to note that
this effect appears with a large number of drugs currently
used that work with different mechanism of action, such
as microtubule inhibitors, DNA damaging agent and
antimetabolites. These results suggest that CP could
increase the effects of conventional chemotherapy for
B-ALL and pointed towards the potential clinical utility
of ER-stress inducers, although further studies are needed
to better understand the molecular mechanism(s) involved
in the synergistic effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
[Cu(thp)4][PF6], abbreviated CP was synthesize
as previously described[12]. N-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]L-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD.fmk),
tunicamycin and cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Italy).

Cell Lines and Growth Inhibition Assay
The human leukemia cell lines RS 4;11, SEM,
REH, RCH-ACV, MHH-CALL2, Jurkat, CCRF-CEM,
HSB2, HL-60, K562, THP-1, MV4;11 were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Italy)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
glutamine (2 mM; Life Technologies, Italy), penicillin
(100 U/ml; Life Technologies, Italy) and streptomycin
(100 µg/ml; Life Technologies, Italy), and maintained
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The
cytotoxic activity of CP was determined using a standard
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazodium
bromide (MTT) based colorimetric assay (Sigma-Aldrich,
Italy). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 2x104
cells/well in 96-well microtiter plates. After 24 h, cells
were exposed to the test compound. After different times,
cell survival was determined by the addition of an MTT
solution as previously described [45].

Primary leukemia cell cultures

(Life Technologies, Italy) as previously described [45].
Cytochrome c release was analyzed by flow cytometry
using a commercial kit (Innocyte flow cytometric
cytochrome c release kit, Calbiochem, Italy) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

B-ALL patient samples were obtained after
informed consent following the tenets of the Declaration
of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethical
Committee board of the University of Padova, the Padova
Academic Hospital and the Italian Association of Pediatric
Onco-Hematology (AIEOP). Diagnosis was made
according to standard cytomorphology, cytochemistry
and immunophenotypic criteria [46]. All analyzed B-ALL
samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis before
treatment, after Lymphoprep (Fresenius KABI, Norge AS)
separation of mononuclear cells. The percentage of CD19+
cells ranged from 80% to 95%.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and
bone marrow cells from healthy donors were obtained
by separation on Lymphoprep (Fresenius KABI, Norge
AS) gradient. After extensive washing, cells were
resuspended (1.0 x 106 cells/ml) in RPMI1640 with
10% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight in 96well tissue culture microtiter plate. For cytotoxicity
evaluations in proliferating PBMC cultures, non-adherent
cells were resuspended in growth medium, containing 2.5
µg/ml phytohematoglutinin (PHA) (Irvine Scientific). To
isolate B-lymphocyte, PBMC obtained by Lymphoprep
(Fresenius KABI, Norge AS) separation were labeled with
anti-CD19-APC (BD Biosciences, Italy) and collected by
cell sorting.

Proteasome activity on purified cell extracts
RS4;11 and SEM cells were homogenized in a lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA) and ultracentrifuged
for 2 h at 300,000 g. Total protein content was estimated
with BioRad protein assay (BioRad) and 100 μg of protein
aliquots were incubated for 60 min at 37°C with with
CP at different concentrations. Afterwards, fluorogenic
proteasome substrates (N-Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido4-methylcoumarin (AMC) for chymotripsin (CT), BocGln-Ala-Arg-AMC for tripsin (T) and Z-Leu-Leu-GluAMC for peptidyl glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing (PGPH)
were added and the substrate hydrolysis was measured
after 30 min by monitoring the release of Tyr-7-amido4-methylcoumarin (AMC) using a Varian Cary Eclipse
(Varian) spectrofluorometer (excitation at 370 nm,
emission at 460 nm).

Cellular uptake
RS4;11, SEM, Jurkat, THP-1 and PBMC cells
(7x105) were seeded in 25 cm2 flasks in growth medium.
After 24 h, the cells were incubated for further 24 h with
6.25, 12.5 and 25 µM of CP. Cells were washed with
PBS and harvested. Samples were subjected to three
freezing/thawing cycles at -80 °C, and then vigorously
vortexed. Aliquots were removed for the determination
of protein content by the BioRad protein assay (BioRad).
The samples were added with 1 ml highly pure nitric
acid (Cu: ≤0.005 μg/kg, TraceSELECT® Ultra, Sigma
Chemical Co.) and transferred into a microwave teflon
vessel. Subsequently, samples were submitted to standard
procedure using a speed wave MWS-3 Berghof instrument
(Eningen, Germany). After cooling, each mineralized
sample was analyzed for copper amount by using a Varian
AA Duo graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer
(Varian, Palo Alto, CA; USA) at 324 nm. The calibration
curve was obtained using known concentrations of
standard solutions purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

Externalization of Phosphatidylserine (PS)
Surface exposure of PS by apoptotic cells was
measured by flow cytometry with a Coulter Cytomics
FC500 (Beckmann Coulter, USA) by adding Annexin
V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) to cells according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Annexin-V Fluos, Roche
Diagnostic, Italy).

Analysis of Cell Cycle Distribution
5x105 RS4;11 and SEM cells in exponential growth
were treated with different concentrations of CP for
different times. After the incubation, cells were collected,
centrifuged and fixed with ice-cold ethanol (70%) and
stained with PI as described previously [45]. DNA
histograms were analyzed using Multicycle for Windows
(Phoenix Flow Systems)

Western Blot Analysis

Assessment of Mitochondrial Changes and
Release of Cytochrome c

Cells were treated with CP and, after different
times, were collected, centrifuged and washed with ice
cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The pellet was
then resuspended in lysis buffer as described [47]. The
protein concentration in the supernatant was determined

The mitochondrial membrane potential was
measured with the lipophilic cation 5,5’,6,6’-tetrachlo1,1’,3,3’-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine (JC-1)

of protein (10 µg) were resolved using SDS-PAGE gel
electrophoresis (Criterion precast Tris-HCl gel, BioRad,
Italy) and transferred to PVDF Hybond-p membranes
(GE Healthcare, Italy). Membranes were blocked with
2% ECL-Blocking Solution (GE Healthcare, Italy) for
2 hours at room temperature. Membranes were then
incubated with primary antibodies against Bcl-2, PARP,
procaspase-9, cleaved caspase-7, GRP78, (Cell Signaling,
Italy), cleaved caspase-12 (Abcam, UK), β-actin (Sigma
Aldrich, Italy), and cleaved caspase-3 (Novus Biologicals,
Italy) overnight. Membranes were then incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen,
Italy) for 60 min. All membranes were visualized using
ECL Select (GE Healthcare, Italy) and exposed to
Hyperfilm MP (GE Healthcare, Italy). To ensure equal
protein loading, each membrane was stripped and reprobed
with anti-β-actin antibody.

treatments were analyzed using the two-sided Student’s t
test. P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.

To test potential synergistic, additive, or antagonistic
effects of the combination of CP and drugs commonly
used in B-ALL treatment, we performed MTT experiments
as follows.
SEM, and RS4;11 cells were treated for 48 hours
with one of the most used chemotherapeutic agents:
cytarabine (Aractyn, Pfizer), daunorubicin (Pfizer),
vincristine (Pfizer), or dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich).
CP was also added to each drug solution, at fixed
combination ratios. Cell viability was determined after 48
hours of treatment by MTT test as described above. To
determine the synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects
of the drug combinations, we used CalcuSyn software
(version 2.0, Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom) based
on the method of the combination index (CI) described by
Chou and Talalay [32]. Synergy, additivity and antagonism
were defined by a CI<1, CI=1, or CI>1, respectively.
