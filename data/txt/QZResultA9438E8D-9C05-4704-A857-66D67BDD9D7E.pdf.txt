Abstract
Oncogenic transformation may reprogram tumor metabolism
and render cancer cells addicted to extracellular nutrients. Deprivation of these nutrients may therefore represent a therapeutic
opportunity, but predicting which nutrients cancer cells become
addicted remains difﬁcult. Here, we performed a nutrigenetic
screen to determine the phenotypes of isogenic pairs of clear cell
renal cancer cells (ccRCC), with or without VHL, upon the
deprivation of individual amino acids. We found that cystine
deprivation triggered rapid programmed necrosis in VHL-deﬁcient cell lines and primary ccRCC tumor cells, but not in VHLrestored counterparts. Blocking cystine uptake signiﬁcantly
delayed xenograft growth of ccRCC. Importantly, cystine deprivation triggered similar metabolic changes regardless of VHL
status, suggesting that metabolic responses alone are not sufﬁcient

to explain the observed distinct fates of VHL-deﬁcient and
restored cells. Instead, we found that increased levels of TNFa
associated with VHL loss forced VHL-deﬁcient cells to rely on
intact RIPK1 to inhibit apoptosis. However, the preexisting
elevation in TNFa expression rendered VHL-deﬁcient cells
susceptible to necrosis triggered by cystine deprivation. We
further determined that reciprocal ampliﬁcation of the Src–p38
(MAPK14)–Noxa (PMAIP1) signaling and TNFa–RIP1/3
(RIPK1/RIPK3)–MLKL necrosis pathways potentiated cystinedeprived necrosis. Together, our ﬁndings reveal that cystine
deprivation in VHL-deﬁcient RCCs presents an attractive
therapeutic opportunity that may bypass the apoptosis-evading mechanisms characteristic of drug-resistant tumor cells.

Introduction

tive mechanisms often allow for survival, oncogenic events or
stresses may render cancer cells "addicted" to certain amino
acids and therefore susceptible to death upon their deprivation.
Identiﬁcation of such features in tumors may present therapeutic potential (5). For example, glutamine has been reported
to be essential for cancer cells harboring oncogenic events,
including c-Myc activation (6–8), IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) mutation (9), and stresses (10, 11). Recently, we and
others have found that inﬂexible tumor metabolic dysregulation in basal-type breast cancer cells exhibit a robust hypoxia
program (12). Hypoxia imposed signiﬁcant metabolic inﬂexibility and cell death can be affected by nutrient availability
(13–15). Leucine deprivation causes extensive apoptotic death
in melanoma cells due to absence of autophagy (16).
Although amino acid addictions are becoming appreciated as
important metabolic characteristics with therapeutic potential, it
is difﬁcult to predict these addictions (5). Therefore, we established a "nutrigenetic screen" by dropping out one (or all) amino
acid at a time to determine resulting viability and phenotype of
cancer cells with different subtypes or genetic alterations. We
identiﬁed a profound cystine addiction in VHL-deﬁcient clear
cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) that was abolished by the
restoration of VHL. We also found that the cystine-deprived
necrosis involved the activation and reciprocal signaling ampliﬁcation between the Src–p38–Noxa and TNFa–RIPK1/RIPK3–
MLKL pathways. While increased TNFa activity in the VHL-deﬁcient ccRCC may be essential for tumor progression, this oncogenic predisposition also renders tumor cells susceptible to the
cystine-deprived necrosis and provides potential therapeutic
opportunities.

Cellular metabolism comprises various biochemical processes
that produce or consume energy and biomolecules by breaking
and synthesizing metabolites in the pathways of carbohydrates,
fatty acids, and amino acids. Extensive connections exist between
metabolism and oncogenic signaling to coordinate the energy
status in cancer cells to support their distinct and enormous
biosynthetic (macromolecules) and bioenergetic (energy) needs
(1–4). While amino acids are building blocks of proteins, different amino acids also provide essential intermediates for various
processes: carbon and nitrogen for biosynthesis, the citric acid
cycle (TCA) for ATP generation, SAM (S-Adenosyl methionine)
for epigenetic modiﬁcations, antistress capacity to cope with the
oxidative stresses. Mammals have at least two major adaptive
mechanisms, mTOR and GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2, EIF2AK4), that sense the deprivation of amino acids and
trigger amino acid response (AAR) programs. While these adap1

Cystine Deprivation Triggered Programmed Necrosis

Materials and Methods
Materials, tissue culture, and amino acid deprivation protocol
RCC lines (RCC4, 786-O, and their VHL-reconstituted counterparts) were provided by Denise Chan (University of California,
San Francisco, San Francisco, CA), which were further authenticated by DDC Medical using short tandem repeat method in
November 2015. All cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% heatinactivated FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin in a humidiﬁed
incubator at 37 C and 5% CO2.
To prepare media deﬁcient in each amino acid, Earle
Balanced Salt Solution was supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose,
0.37 mmol/L sodium bicarbonate, 24.8 mmol/L ferric nitrates, 10% dialyzed FBS (Sigma), and MEM vitamin solution
(Invitrogen). Different amino acid combinations were then
added. Cells were plated in the complete DMEM media 1 day
prior to PBS-rinsing and amino acid deprivation.
Cell cytotoxicity and survival
Cell death induced by cystine deprivation, sulfasalazine,
or erastin was measured by CytoTox-Fluor Cytotoxicity Assay
(Promega), cell number (crystal violet staining, counting), or
CellTiter-Glo Assay (Promega). Total caspase activity was determined by Homogeneous caspase assay (Roche). ROS was
measured by OxiSelect ROS Kit (Cell Biolabs). The Annexin V/
propidium iodide (PI) assay was performed according to the
company protocol (TACS Annexin V – Fluorescein in situ, R&D
Systems) using BD FACSCanto II.
Metabolomic proﬁling
Metabolites were extracted from VHL-deﬁcient and VHL-reconstituted 786-O exposed to either 200 mmol/L (control) or 1 mmol/L
cystine (deprivation) for 18 hours. The metabolite levels in each
sample were normalized by Phenol Red (Supplementary Table S2)
and subjected to hierarchical clustering using Cluster 3.0. For
speciﬁc metabolite associations with genetic events, data were
analyzed in GraphPad Prism for correlation and signiﬁcance.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma) supplemented with
protease inhibitor and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein
assay. Equal amounts of protein were loaded for the immunoblot
analyses. The signal was detected by the ECL plus Western blotting
detection system (Amersham). The detailed procedures are provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
RNA isolation, Affymetrix hybridization, and real-time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted by RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) from RCC cells
exposed to control or cystine-deprived media for 6 hours, labeled,
and hybridized to Affymetrix U133A 2.0 arrays (GSE60422). Total
RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript-II
reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) and random hexamers.
The level of gene expression was measured by qPCR with Power
SYBR Green PCR Mix (Applied Biosystems). All primers were
listed in Supplementary Table S5.
Gene expression and signature analyses
Affymetrix probe intensities were normalized by RMA. The
changes of gene expression in RCC4 VHL-reconstituted cells were
derived by zero transformation (Dlog2) against those in control

cells. Probe sets that varied by 2-fold in at least three samples were
selected for hierarchical clustering. We compared the pathway
enrichment VHL-null RCC4 (vector) versus VHL-restored RCC4
(VHL; GSE60422) using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
performed at Broad Public Server using G2 annotated genesets
with default criteria of 1,000 permutations (Supplementary
Table S1). Similarly, the effects of cystine deprivation on gene
expression were derived by zero transformation and selected
probe sets that varied by 20.5-fold in at least two samples (Supplementary Table S3).
Cystine deprivation (CysDep), TNFa, and VHL gene signature
projection analysis was performed according to ref. 17 and
detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Xenograft drug treatment
A total of 1  106 VHL-deﬁcient 786-O cells were implanted
subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of NOD.CB17-PrkdcSCID-J
mice (The Jackson Laboratory). Tumors were measured 2 to
3 times per week using a vernier caliper and volumes were
calculated using the following formula [Volume ¼ (width2 
length)/2]. Once tumor volume reached 200–300 mm3, animals were randomized into control or treatment group
and injected intraperitoneally with PBS (control) or SAS
(250 mg/kg; treatment group) once daily for 17 days. Tumor
volume was measured twice weekly and reported as SD. All
experiments were performed following Duke Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee approval in accordance with
the institutional and national guidelines.
Statistical analyses
Experimental results were analyzed with a Student t test using
Prism (GraphPad). Data were expressed as mean SD with a P
value < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
A nutrigenetic screen identiﬁed cystine addiction
of VHL-deﬁcient RCC
To identify nutrient addiction of RCC, we established a "nutrigenetic screen" by dropping out one (or all) amino acid at a time
to determine the phenotypic effects. As the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL) gene is frequently lost or mutated in sporadic ccRCC (18),
we selected two isogenic pairs of VHL-deﬁcient cell lines, RCC4
and 786-O cells infected by an empty vector (Vec) or wild-type
VHL for screens. These paired isogenic cells were subjected to the
deprivation of each one of 15 amino acids in DMEM (supplemented with dialyzed FBS) to evaluate their effect on viability.
As expected, the deprivation of most amino acids arrested proliferation without causing cytotoxicity. One exception was that
glycine removal did not inhibit proliferation, similar to our
previous ﬁndings in MCF7 (19). Interestingly, the deprivation of
cystine, the predominant dimeric form of cysteine in media,
induced acute and extensive cell death in VHL-deﬁcient, but not
VHL-restored RCC4 and 786-O cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A and
S1B). These cells exhibited a swollen morphology, followed by
extensive ﬂoating debris (Supplementary Fig. S1C). When a cell
cytotoxicity assay was used to quantitate cell death via released
protease in media, cystine deprivation triggered massive amounts
of released protease in VHL-deﬁcient cells, but not VHL-reconstituted cells (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1C). The deprivation of all 15 amino acids (-AA) signiﬁcantly reduced the cell

death caused by cystine deprivation. Next, we exposed the VHLdeﬁcient and -restored cells to various cystine levels and found
1.25 mmol/L of cystine triggered cell death in most VHL-deﬁcient
cells by cell number and crystal violet (Fig. 1B and C and
Supplementary Fig. S1D). In contrast, a similar level of cystine
only arrested proliferation in VHL-reconstituted cells without
signiﬁcant death.
Cystine is transported into cells by the cystine/glutamate
transporter [Xc (-) system] and reduced to cysteine as substrate
for the synthesis of GSH, taurine, and other metabolites.
To identify the relevant metabolites for cystine-deprived death,
we supplemented different metabolites and found that glutathione, but not taurine, protected cells from cystine-deprived
death and supported proliferation (Fig. 1C). In addition, we

1894 Cancer Res; 76(7) April 1, 2016

found that inhibitors of glutathione synthesis (buthionine
sulfoximine) or cystine importer xCT (SLC7A11) (sulfasalazine) also triggered extensive death in VHL-deﬁcient, but
not VHL-restored RCC4 (Fig. 1D and E and Supplementary
Fig. S1E). Compared with RCC4 cells, 786-O cells were less
sensitive to either BSO or SAS (Supplementary Fig. S1F).
However, combining BSO and SAS induced massive cell death
in VHL-deﬁcient, but not VHL-restored 786-O (Supplementary
Fig. S1F). We found that primary ccRCC cells, derived from
surgically removed RCC tumors without VHL protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S1G), were also extremely sensitive to
cystine deprivation or SAS (Fig. 1F and G). To test the in vivo
cystine addiction of 786-O xenograft models, we ﬁrst established the xenografts of 786-O after 4 weeks of subcutaneous

injection. After the tumors were established, we treated the
mice with SAS and found that SAS treatment signiﬁcantly
reduced tumor growth (Fig. 1H, P¼ 0.0082). Together, these
data indicated that VHL-deﬁcient ccRCC cells and xenografts
are profoundly addicted to cystine and sensitive to SAS. In
addition, reconstitution of VHL protein expression abolished
the cysteine addiction.
Cysteine deprivation induces RIPK1/3-MLKL–dependent
necrosis
Next, we investigated the type of cell death in cystine-deprived
VHL-deﬁcient RCCs. The swollen cell morphology and membrane leakage suggested necrosis instead of apoptosis. We found
the cystine-deprived cell death was not associated with PARP1
cleavage, a common marker of apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Cysteine
deprivation led to a large population of PI positive and
Annexin-V–negative cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A) further sug-

gested a necrotic cell death with loss of membrane integrity. In
addition, cystine deprivation reduced, instead of increased, the
level of general caspase activity (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a pancaspase inhibitor Z-Vad-FMK (Z-Vad) failed to protect cystinedeprived death. In contrast, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), an inhibitor of
receptor-interacting kinase 1 (RIPK1), rescued RCC4 and 786-O
cells from cystine-deprived death (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S2B). RIPK1 silencing also rescued cystine-deprived death
(Fig. 2D). In addition, we found that Nec-1 also protected the
patient-derived primary ccRCC cells from cystine-deprived death
(Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Recent investigations of programmed necrosis have identiﬁed
important roles of RIPK1, RIPK3 (receptor-interacting kinase 3)
and MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like; 20). MLKL is
phosphorylated by RIPK3 and forms oligomers to execute necrosis (21). We observed that Necrosulfonamide (NSA), a MLKL
inhibitor, blocked cystine-deprived death in a dose-dependent

manner (Fig. 2E and F and Supplementary Fig. S2D). Cystine
deprivation triggered MLKL oligomerization and, to a lesser
extent, dimerization and trimerization in both RCC4 and 786O cells (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. S2E). MLKL oligomerizations were veriﬁed by two independent phosphor-MLKL antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S2E). NSA also reduced MLKL oligomerization during cystine deprivation in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. S2E). However, the
MLKL oligomers could not be disrupted into monomers by
b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME) or urea, which was different from
previous reports (22, 23). This may be due to other cystinedeprived modiﬁcations, in addition to disulﬁde bonds, that
contribute to the formation of MLKL aggregates. Furthermore,
cystine-deprived MLKL oligomerization was only observed in
VHL-deﬁcient RCC4 (Fig. 2H) and 786-O (Supplementary
Fig. S2F) cells but not in VHL-reconstituted cells. Collectively,
these data clearly indicated that cysteine deprivation triggered the
RIPK1/3-MLKL canonical necrosis pathway, which was suppressed by VHL reconstitution.

VHL prevents cystine-deprived necrosis by suppressing TNFa
signaling independent of hypoxia-induced factors
To understand the mechanism by which VHL protected
against cystine-deprived necrosis, we performed gene expression analysis on RCC4-Vec and RCC4-VHL cells (GSE60422).
The inﬂuence of VHL reconstitution on gene expression was
derived by a zero transformation (24), in which we compared
the transcript level for each gene in VHL-restored cells
(VHL) to that in VHL-deﬁcient cells (Vec). We found that the
reconstitution of VHL induced tremendous gene expression
changes (Fig. 3A). GSEA indicated that many hypoxia-regulated
genes were enriched in VHL-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S1), consistent with constitutive hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) associated with VHL loss (18). In addition,
the target genes of MDM4, EGF, and SOX4 were also enriched
in the VHL-null cells. To examine whether HIFs were involved
in cystine-deprived necrosis, we silenced HIF-2a expression in
786-O cells that only expressed HIF-2a without HIF-1a, to
avoid potential redundancy among HIFs. While two shRNAs

Cystine Deprivation Triggered Programmed Necrosis

reduced HIF-2a expression in 786-O cells to the level in 786-O
VHL-restored cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A), they had no
protective effects on cystine-deprived necrosis (Supplementary
Fig. S3A and S3B). Therefore, the protective effects of VHL were
HIF-independent.
GSEA analysis also identiﬁed the enrichment of TNFa pathway in VHL-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 3B). In agreement with this, we
observed higher protein and mRNA expression of TNFa in both
VHL-deﬁcient RCC4 and 786-O cells (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3C). A previous report also suggested that VHL
repressed the translation of TNFa (25). TNFa can bind TNFa
receptors (TNFR) and trigger caspase-8–dependent apoptosis or
RIPK1/3–mediated necrosis (26, 27). A recent report also indicated that RIPK1 limits caspase-8–dependent, TNFR-induced
apoptosis, and animals with RIPK1-knockout exhibit early
postnatal lethality mediated by caspase-8 and RIPK3 (28).
Interestingly, we observed that silencing of RIPK1 by shRNA
in RCC cells caused caspase-8 and PARP1 cleavage (Supplementary Fig. S3D), indicating apoptotic death. The restoration
of VHL or silencing of TNFa abrogated the apoptosis induced
by silencing of RIPK1 (Fig. 3D and E). VHL-restored cells
exhibited increased cleavages of PARP1 and caspase-8 in a
conﬂuent culture not related to RIPK1 silencing (Supplementary Fig. S3E). These data supported that increased TNFa
activity in VHL-deﬁcient cells predisposed them toward apoptosis, which was prevented by the intact RIPK1.
As RIPK1 blocks increased TNFa-dependent apoptosis in VHLdeﬁcient ccRCC, such combination of TNFa–RIPK1 may also
render them susceptible to cystine-deprived necrosis. To test this
hypothesis, we silenced TNFa in 786-O and RCC4 cells and found
a signiﬁcant reduction in the cystine-deprived necrosis (Fig. 3F
and Supplementary Fig. S3F) and MLKL oligomerization (Supplementary Fig. S3G). Together, these data indicate that RIPK1
prevents apoptosis caused by the increased TNFa activity in VHLdeﬁcient ccRCC. However, high levels of TNFa and intact RIPK1
also predispose VHL-deﬁcient RCC to RIPK1-mediated necrosis
triggered by cystine deprivation.
Similar metabolomic responses to cystine deprivation
in RCC regardless of VHL
Cystine deprivation triggered programmed necrosis in VHLdeﬁcient, but not VHL-restored RCC cells. One obvious explanation for such life versus death fate might be their different
metabolic response to cystine deprivation. For example, VHLreconstituted cells might consume less and/or able to synthesize
more cysteine/glutathione (GSH) from other sources. To investigate such possibilities, we performed metabolomic assays (by
Metabolon) in 786-O VHL-deﬁcient and VHL-restored cells
when exposed to regular (HC, 200 mmol/L) or low cystine (LC,
1 mmol/L) for 18 hours (Supplementary Table S2). We compared
the changes of 158 known metabolites under cystine deprivation
in VHL-deﬁcient and VHL-restored 786-O cells. To our surprise,
the metabolic responses were largely similar (Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Cystine deprivation dramatically reduced cysteine,
GSH, and glutathione disulﬁde (GSSG) to undetectable levels in
both cells (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Cystine deprivation also increased the levels of sorbitol, acetyl-CoA, asparagines, and several metabolites in the g-glutamyl cycle (Supplementary Fig. S4B). As intracellular GSH and GSSG were depleted
regardless of VHL status, VHL restoration did not prevent cystinedeprived necrosis by maintaining the levels of GSH and GSSG.

Speciﬁc induction of Noxa in VHL-deﬁcient cells
to trigger necrosis
In spite of similar metabolic responses, cystine deprivation
increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in VHLdeﬁcient but not VHL-restored cells (Fig. 4B). We hypothesized
that such distinct changes in ROS may be caused by different
transcriptional response to cystine deprivation. Therefore, we performed gene expression analysis to compare the transcriptional
responses to cystine deprivation (GSE60422). Zero transformation
identiﬁed shared and distinct transcriptional responses between
the VHL-restored and VHL-deﬁcient RCC (Fig. 4C; Supplementary
Table S3). For example, GADD45A/B, CTH, XBP1, and SLC7A11
were induced in both cells (Fig. 4C and D). SLC7A11 encodes an
xCT subunit responsible for cystine uptake. Therefore, its induction
may reﬂect the cells' adaptive response to import more cystine
during cystine deprivation. The transcriptional responses seen only
in VHL-deﬁcient cells included the induction of IL8, ANGPTL4,
and PLAU (Fig. 4C) as well as ATF3 and Noxa (Fig. 4C and D).
We conﬁrmed the induction of Noxa protein by cystine deprivation (Fig. 4E). Noxa is a proapoptotic protein that targets mitochondria to induce apoptosis (29). Therefore, we were interested
in whether this apoptotic protein also participated in cystinedeprived necrosis. The silencing of Noxa by two shRNAs signiﬁcantly reduced death in 786-O and RCC4 cells (Fig. 4F and
Supplementary Fig. S4D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the speciﬁc induction of the proapoptotic Noxa in
VHL-deﬁcient ccRCC contribute to the cystine-deprived necrosis.
The Src-p38 signaling pathway is required for
cystine-deprived necrosis
In response to some apoptotic stimuli, reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce Noxa expression via MAPK signaling pathways (30). To identify the speciﬁc MAPK responsible for cystine-deprived necrosis, we tested a set of inhibitors of MAPKs or
oxidases. We found that the inhibitors of JNK (SP600125),
PI3Ks (LY294002), and NADPH oxidase (VAS-2870) did not
affect cystine-deprived necrosis (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In
contrast, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 protected both
RCC4 and 786-O cells from cystine-deprived necrosis (Fig. 5A
and Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Furthermore, cystine
deprivation increased p38 phosphorylation and the p38 inhibitor abolished induction of Noxa (Fig. 5B). Consistent with
their protection from cystine-deprived necrosis, Nec-1 treatment and VHL reconstitution also attenuated increased p38
phosphorylation and Noxa induction (Figs. 5B and 4E and
Supplementary Fig. S5C). These data suggested that such signaling differences may account for the distinct life versus death
fate upon cystine deprivation.
The tyrosine kinases Src and FAK can be activated by either ROS
or TNFa and play critical roles in cellular signal transduction
pathways including p38 (31). We examined effects of the Src
inhibitor (Su6656) and FAK inhibitor (PF-573228) on cystinedeprived necrosis. We found that Su6656, but not PF-573228,
protected both RCC cells from cystine-deprived necrosis (Fig. 5C
and Supplementary Fig. S5D). Furthermore, Src silencing protected cells from cystine-deprived necrosis (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S5E). These results indicated that Src was a critical
component for cystine-deprived necrosis.
Next, we fractionated cells to examine protein translocations
between different subcellular components during cystine deprivation. Cystine deprivation increased RIPK1 protein in the

similar to what was reported in TNFa-induced necrosis (32).
In contrast, cystine deprivation did not increase the RIPK3 or
caspase-8 in the membrane fraction, but reduced their levels
in the cytosolic fraction of VHL-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 5E).
Interestingly, we found that cystine deprivation triggered Src
modiﬁcation(s) that signiﬁcantly slowed its migration pattern
into smear (Fig. 5E). As Src is a membrane-anchored protein,
such Src smears were prominent in the triton-insoluble membrane fraction of VHL-deﬁcient cells, but not VHL-restored
cells. This modiﬁed Src was accompanied by the translocation
of RIPK1 protein, further suggesting an important role. However, the nature of Src modiﬁcations upon cystine deprivation

1898 Cancer Res; 76(7) April 1, 2016

remained unclear. We ruled out several protein modiﬁcations,
including K48- and K63-ubiquitination, sumoylation, and
[carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) modiﬁcation (Supplementary
Fig. S5F)]. Together, these results indicated that cystine deprivation in VHL-deﬁcient ccRCC activates the Src–p38 signaling pathway, which contributed to cystine-deprived necrosis.
During this process, the Src protein becomes modiﬁed by
unknown modiﬁcations that change its migration pattern.

target mitochondria and lead to mitochondria permeabilization
(21, 33). Mitochondria complex I and III of the electron transport
chain are a major source of cellular ROS (34), which could act to
amplify the signal during cystine deprivation. We found that the
complex I inhibitor, rotenone, strongly protected RCC4 (Fig. 6A)
and 786-O (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B) from cystinedeprived death. Necrox-5 (Nec-5), a mitochondria ROS scavenger
(35), also protected cells death under cystine deprivation (Fig. 6B
and Supplementary Fig. S6B). As expected, rotenone and Nec-5
strongly abolished Noxa induction and attenuated p38 phosphorylation under cystine deprivation, similar to the Src inhibitor
Su-6656 (Fig. 6C). These results implicated the mitochondrial
ROS signaling in ampliﬁcation of the cystine-deprived necrosis.
Similarly, we observed that suppression of Noxa induction also
signiﬁcantly attenuated its upstream kinase p38's phosphorylation (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S6C). Accordingly, suppression of TNFa–RIP1/3–MLKL pathway by TNFa silencing or
Nec-1 also reduced both p38 phosphorylation and Noxa induction during cystine deprivation (Fig. 6E). These results suggested

www.aacrjournals.org

that inhibition of either component in the necrosis signaling
could limit activation of upstream or downstream components.
Collectively, these data suggested that mitochondrial ROS generation was critical in the ampliﬁcation loop of necrosis during
cystine deprivation. While cystine deprivation initiates the signaling cascade, the two downstream mitochondria-targeting
effectors, Noxa and MLKL, are required to generate a reciprocal
ampliﬁcation loop between the Src–p38–Noxa and TNF–RIP1/3–
MLKL necrosis pathways that ultimately results in necrosis.

As shown above, the TNFa signaling pathway was required for
cystine-deprived necrosis. We projected a deﬁned TNFa gene
signature (TNFa-Sig (36), Supplementary Table S4) to the gene
expression proﬁle of RCC4 cells and found higher activity of
TNFa-Sig in VHL-deﬁcient cells (Supplementary Fig. S6D), consistent with a higher level of TNFa signaling in these cells analyzed
by GSEA (Fig. 3B). In addition, we deﬁned 115 probe sets altered

by cystine deprivation as the cystine-deprived gene signature
(CysDep-Sig, Fig. 4C; Supplementary Table S3), performed signature projection analysis, and found higher activity of CysDepSig in VHL-deﬁcient cells (Supplementary Fig. S6E). We then
performed CysDep-sig and TNFa-Sig projection analysis on the
dataset of ccRCC tumors and their paired normal tissues
(GSE36895; ref. 37). Consistent with our observations in cell
lines, the pathway activities of both TNFa-Sig (Fig. 6F and
Supplementary Fig. S6F) and CysDep-Sig (Fig. 6G and Supplementary Fig. S6G) were signiﬁcantly higher in the ccRCC tumor
samples that associated with lost/mutated VHL. While CysDepSig and TNFa-Sig included approximately 100 probe sets respectively, but only four probe sets overlapping, the activities of
CysDep-Sig and TNFa-Sig were highly correlated in tumor
dataset (P < 0.0001, Fig. 6H). Similarly, a similar strong
correlation between CysDep-Sig and TNFa-Sig pathway was
found in 606 RCC tumor dataset from The Cancer Genome
Atlas. Both activities of CysDep and TNFa also negatively
correlated with activity of VHL in tumors (Supplementary Fig.
S6H). Such high correlation suggested that cystine addiction
might be associated with increased TNFa activity and a common feature of VHL-deﬁcient ccRCC cell lines or tumors as a
predictor of cystine addiction.

Low doses of erastin trigger programmed necrosis as cystine
deprivation in RCC cells through RIPK1
Erastin, originally identiﬁed to target oncogenic-mutated Ras
cells through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels
(38), is recently shown to inhibit xCT and induce ferroptosis:
an iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death (39). We
examined the sensitivity of the isogenic pairs of VHL-deﬁcient
and -restored ccRCC cells to erastin. We found that low doses
(1–2 mmol/L) erastin induced extensive cell death with protease
release in VHL-deﬁcient RCC4 and 786-O cells, but not VHLrestored cells (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig. S7A). VHL restoration offered less protection to high dose of erastin (5 or
10 mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S7A). In addition, low doses of
erastin also induced Noxa protein in VHL-deﬁcient, but not in
VHL-restored ccRCC cells, similar to cystine deprivation (Fig. 7B
and Supplementary Fig. S7B). Therefore, we examined whether
low doses of erastin utilize the same signaling pathways to induce
canonical necrosis as cystine deprivation. Indeed, the silencing of
RIPK1, TNFa, or Noxa all rescued erastin-induced death (Fig. 7C
and Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7C). Taken together, these
results suggest that low doses of erastin trigger canonical necrosis
in VHL-deﬁcient ccRCC via a similar mechanism with cystine
deprivation.

Cystine Deprivation Triggered Programmed Necrosis

Collectively, our data allow us to propose a novel model of
cystine addiction in VHL-deﬁcient ccRCC (Fig. 7D). While the
increased TNFa signaling associated with VHL loss contributes to
tumor progression, such a pre-existing architecture required
RIPK1 or the necrosome complex to inhibit caspase-8–mediated
apoptosis. The delicate balance between TNFa and RIPK1 was
extremely sensitive to redox level regulated by cystine-derived
GSH, and caused tumor cells to be vulnerable to cystine deprivation or inhibition of cystine transport. Therefore, cystine addiction may present a novel form of nutrient addiction that coopts
the preexisting oncogenic signaling pathways as potential promising therapeutic approach.

Discussion
While cysteine is appreciated as a limiting component of
GSH synthesis that can be therapeutically targeted, much
remains unknown about the susceptible tumor types and
underlying mechanisms. Here, we have uncovered a speciﬁc
cystine addiction in VHL-deﬁcient ccRCC that is based on the
preexisting signaling changes associated with VHL loss. As
cystine deprivation depletes intracellular GSH in both cystine-addicted and -independent cells, metabolic differences
cannot readily explain the dramatic differences of necrosis
versus live. In the cystine-addicted cells, increasing TNFa associated with VHL loss requires RIPK1 to prevent apoptosis.
However, these increased activities of TNFa and RIPK1 in
VHL-deﬁcient cells render them vulnerable to cystine-deprived
necrosis that is propagated by mutual ampliﬁcation between

www.aacrjournals.org

the Src–p38–Noxa and TNFa–RIPK1/RIPK3–MLKL pathways.
While in cystine-independent cells, low activities of TNFa and
RIPK1 renders cells insensitive to cystine deprivation.
Although the regulation of the protein stability of HIFs
is the most recognizable activity of VHL, VHL also has HIFindependent actions. Now, others (25) and we showed that
VHL suppresses the TNFa signaling in an HIF-independent
manner. TNFa gene signatures are also enriched in ccRCC,
whose VHL is often lost or mutated. Higher levels of TNFa in
tumors often contribute to tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (40, 41). These increased TNFa pathways may also bring about a vulnerability that can be therapeutically exploited, such as the necrosis triggered by either
cystine deprivation or xCT inhibitors. Cystine-addicted cells
may rely on continuous cystine import and de novo GSH synthesis to protect from higher levels of oxidative stress. Therefore,
such convergence of cystine addiction and tumor progression
may open a signiﬁcant therapeutic window for clinical beneﬁt.
Erastin was ﬁrst discovered on the basis of its ability to selectively eradicate tumors with oncogenic Ras mutations (38). Further studies have implicated the ability of erastin to block xCT and
cystine transport in a form of iron-dependent death called ferroptosis (39). In these studies, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)
and lipid oxidation, but not components of necrosis (RIPK1,
RIPK3 and MLKL), were involved in ferroptosis (42). However,
our data suggest that low dose of erastin shares a similar necrosis
death mechanism as cystine deprivation, as the silencing of
RIPK1, TNFa, and Noxa all rendered RCC resistant to low doses
of erastin. In previous studies, RIPK1 silencing was not able to

prevent cell death under higher doses of erastin. These inconsistencies can be caused by different doses of erastin (low vs. high)
or different genetic contexts of the cell types (wide type renal
tubule vs. VHL-deﬁcient RCC).
Our ﬁndings of the cell type–speciﬁc cystine addiction associated with VHL loss may present therapeutic opportunities to
target these clinically challenging tumors (43, 44). While sulfasalazine has been shown to reduce tumor growth and distant
metastases in xenograft models of head/neck and breast cancer
(14, 45, 46), our studies provide additional novel insights. First,
cystine addiction is found only in a VHL-deﬁcient ccRCC with a
signiﬁcant therapeutic window. Second, as cystine deprivation
triggers necrosis instead of apoptosis, it may bypass many
chemoresistant mechanisms that generally avoid apoptotic
pathways. Sunitinib is a FDA approved drug for ccRCC, which
has signiﬁcant cytotoxic effects (47). However, RCC has been
reported to resist this drug treatment (48) that present clinical
challenges. Cystine deprivation may bypass these apoptosisevading mechanisms and trigger necrosis. Finally, high GSH
levels are usually associated with chemoresistance (49). Therefore, cystine deprivation may deplete intracellular GSH and
overcome chemoresistance. For clinical translation, it will be
important to further elucidate intrinsic addiction mechanisms
and deﬁne predictive biomarkers to identify patient populations sensitive to cystine-targeted therapies.
