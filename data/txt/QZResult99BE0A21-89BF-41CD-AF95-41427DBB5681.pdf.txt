BACKGROUND: Physical examination (PE), mammography (MG), breast magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), and pathologic evaluation are used to
assess primary breast cancer. To the authors’ knowledge, their accuracy has not been well studied in
patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Accuracies of each modality in tumor and lymph
node assessment in patients with T3/T4 tumors receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were compared.
METHODS: Forty-five patients of a prospective clinical trial studying T3-T4M0 tumors were included.
Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy: docetaxel/carboplatin with or without trastuzumab before
and/or after surgery (depending on HER-2/neu status and randomization). Tumor measurements by PE,
MG, and MRI and lymph node status by PE and PET were obtained before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Concordance among different clinical measurements was assessed and compared with the tumor
and lymph node staging by pathology. Spearman correlation (r) and root mean square error (RMSE) were
used to measure the accuracy of measurements among all modalities and between modalities and pathologic tumor size. RESULTS: Compared with the tumor size measured by PE, MRI was more accurate than
MG at baseline (r ¼ 0.559, RMSE ¼ 35.4% vs r ¼ 0.046, RMSE ¼ 66.1%). After neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
PE correlated better with pathology than MG or MRI (r ¼ 0.655, RMSE ¼ 88.6% vs r ¼ 0.146, RMSE ¼ 147.1%
and r ¼ 0.364, RMSE ¼ 92.6%). Axillary lymph node assessment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated high specificity but low sensitivity by PET and PE. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested that MRI
was a more accurate imaging study at baseline for T3/T4 tumor, and PE correlated best with pathology
finding. PET and PE both correctly predicted positive axillary lymph nodes but not negative lymph nodes.

Accuracy of Breast Cancer Evaluation/Prati et al

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has gained acceptance in treating locally advanced breast cancer. Although
neoadjuvant chemotherapy affords the same survival rates
as postoperative chemotherapy in women with operable
breast carcinoma,1 the advantages of neoadjuvant treatment over conventional adjuvant chemotherapy are manifold. First, and most importantly, chemotherapy given
before surgery may shrink the large tumors to improve the
resectability in some and to allow for breast conservation
surgery in others, which is otherwise impossible. Second,
it allows for the assessment of tumor response in each
patient. Third, the upfront nature of this treatment provides the earliest chance to treat micrometastatic disease,
saving time that could potentially be lost to local treatment.2 Lastly, the intact neovasculature associated with
cancer can be exploited to the advantage of the patient.
Because surgical excision may alter the tumor’s vasculature, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may have the advantage
of enhancing the local effect through a nondisturbed
blood supply.3,4
The assessment of residual tumor size is important
in determining the surgical course of action after preoperative chemotherapy. Physical examination (PE) is the
accepted clinical standard in the evaluation of tumor size
before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathologic
evaluation is the ultimate assessment of the residual tumor
size after the chemotherapy.3,4 Other clinical tools, such
as mammography (MG) and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), are also used in the assessment of tumor response
to neoadjuvant treatment.
However, imprecision in tumor measurements
accompanies any of these modalities. All 3 modalities
(PE, MG, and MRI) have been found to carry both significant false-positive5-8 and false-negative rates.4,5,7,9 In
addition, chemotherapy itself may induce significant biologic changes of the tumor, affecting imaging findings differently. As a result, correlation made among MG, MRI,
positron emission tomography (PET), and PE findings
may not be consistent.
Despite these shortcomings, these disease assessment
tools are mainstays of current clinical practice that guides
treatment, and their relative accuracy must be determined.
Outcomes in previous studies varied. Clinical assessment
of axilla is another important evaluation that guides the
choice of axillary management. Clinical lymph node evaluation is conventionally determined by PE, and is not the

focus of MG and MRI. In recent years, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET has emerged as a promising imaging
technology for clinical evaluation of lymph node metastases. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of all available tools—PE, MG, MRI,
and PET scan—for clinical staging of primary breast cancer and axillary lymph nodes in women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Study Design
Forty-eight patients reported in this study were participants of an ongoing trial approved by the institutional
review board of the University of California, Los Angeles.
Eligible patients had confirmed primary adenocarcinoma
of the breast either >2 cm or with skin/chest wall involvement (T2, T3, and T4). Women with evidence of distant
metastasis; any prior radiation to the breast; docetaxel
(75 mg/m2), carboplatin (area under the curve ¼ 6), or
trastuzumab chemotherapy; or a breast cancer diagnosis
within the past 5 years were excluded. In this study,
patients were treated with 4 cycles of preoperative docetaxel and carboplatin (with or without trastuzumab) followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy was
randomly assigned to the patient whose tumor was HER2/neu positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization. All
HER-2/neu–positive patients received postoperative trastuzumab, with both treatment arms receiving a total of 12
months of treatment. Baseline breast disease was evaluated
by PE, MG, and PET scan. The breast MRI was required
for those with discrepancies between the PE and MG
findings or with nonmeasurable disease and was optional
for others. The MRI findings were available in most cases.
The same baseline breast evaluations were repeated after
the completion of 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
The clinical findings of different modalities were compared and the residual tumor in the breast and axilla were
then compared with the pathologic evaluations after their
definitive surgery.
Of the original 48 patients, only the T3 and T4
patients were included in the current analysis, totaling
47 patients. One of the 47 patients refused surgery
because of a clinical complete response. Another went off
study because her tumor did not respond well to the trial
1195

chemotherapy drugs, and she received a second chemotherapy regimen before her surgery. A total of 45 analyzable patients were left.

Study Assessments
Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and the longest dimension of the multidimensional tumor measurement obtained by PE, MG, and MRI before and after
4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were recorded. The
MRI was required on all who had nonevaluable or nonmeasurable disease on MG or had large discrepancies
between the measurements obtained by PE and MG at
both baseline and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathologic tumor dimensions were measured separately for
invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ components of the
tumor. In the rare case that a patient underwent additional surgeries for margin clearance, only the longest unidimensional measurement of the cancer from the first
definitive surgery was used. An absence of invasive cancer
in the mastectomy or lumpectomy specimen was coded as
a complete pathologic response of the tumor.
Histologic subtype, nuclear grade, histologic differentiation, and lymphovascular invasion together with
estrogen/progesterone receptors, and HER2/neu status
were included in the analyses. Tumor biomarkers from
the initial biopsy report were used for analysis to avoid the
changes that may be induced by the neoadjuvant therapy.
Clinical assessment on axillary lymph node status
was recorded both at baseline and after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy by PET scan and PE. The findings were
compared with pathologic lymph node staging. Both
number of positive lymph nodes and total number of
lymph nodes examined pathologically were recorded.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis included mean and standard deviation
(SD) of the differences between tumor measurements, as
well as the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE is
similar to the SD, except that it compares all the deviations among the differences to zero rather than to the
mean difference. The RMSE incorporates lack of agreement between the measurement in question and the measurement of the standard from both systematic bias (1 is
higher than the other) and random variation from patient
1196

to patient. The ‘‘best’’ measurement compared with the
standard is the 1 that has the smallest RMSE. Bias, the difference between the mean gold standard measurement
(the chosen method to be measured against) and the mean
measurement of the modality in question, was also calculated. Measurement correlation was calculated using both
parametric Pearson correlations and the nonparametric
rank-based Spearman correlations. R2, the square of the
Pearson correlation, represents the percentage of the variation in 1 measurement that is accounted for by variation
in the other measurement.

RESULTS
The median age of the 45 patients included in this report
was 50 years (range, 29-68 years). The majority of the
patient population was white (62%), followed by Hispanic (18%), Asian (16%), and black (4%). By T classification, T3 tumors accounted for 69% of the population,
followed by inflammatory breast cancer or T4d (22%)
and T4a-c tumors (9%). Infiltrating ductal histology
(82%) and moderate to poor histologic differentiation
(82%) were the most common tumor characteristics.
Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was noted in 16 (35%) of
the patients. Greater than one-third of the patients had
hormone receptor–negative tumors (38%) (Table 1). Tumor characteristics (LVI, histologic differentiation, tumor
type, and nuclear grade) were taken from the pathology
report of the tumor biopsy procedures.
Forty patients had the clinical tumor measurements
at baseline and postneoadjuvant chemotherapy. Incomplete data in 5 patients was because of lack of evaluable
films or missing pathologic measurement of the size of
their residual tumor. Forty-three patients at baseline and
44 patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had tumor
size measurable on PE. Two patients at baseline and 1 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not have tumor size
measured by PE because of the diffuse nature of the
inflammatory disease in these 3 patients. Forty-four
patients had baseline MG, of whom 30 patients had tumor measurements; 41 patients had postneoadjuvant
MG, with 29 of them containing tumor measurements.
One patient did not receive MG at baseline because of the
extremely painful inflammatory cancer; 14 others had disease that was either not visible, not measurable, or not
evaluable by MG. Four patients did not undergo MG

after their neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 1 did not have a
baseline MG, and 3 had nonevaluable disease on the baseline MG. In the remaining, 12 had evaluable but nonmeasurable disease or nonevaluable mammographies after
4 cycles of chemotherapy. Architectural distortion and
asymmetrical density were the main abnormalities responsible for a nonmeasurable tumor.
Thirty-three patients had tumor measurements by
MRI at baseline, and 34 had MRI measurements after
their neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At baseline, 10 patients

did not receive MRIs, and 2 patients had nonevaluable
MRIs because of technical problems. The 10 patients who
did not undergo baseline MRI did not receive a postneoadjuvant chemotherapy MRI. Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy MRI was reported as nonevaluable in 1 case.
Twenty-one patients had tumor measurements by
all 3 modalities (PE, MG, and MRI) at baseline. The median tumor size by PE at baseline was 6.5 cm (range, 3.520 cm), 3.5 cm by MG (range, 1.5-9 cm), and 6.2 cm by
MRI (range, 2.9-15 cm); patients were deemed T3 if a tumor measurement >5.0 cm was observed on baseline PE,
baseline MG, or baseline MRI. Comparison of the RMSE
indicated that the MRI finding (RMSE ¼ 2.9) was highly
agreeable with PE. This was in contrast to the poor correlation between MG and PE (RMSE ¼ 4.8). Similarly,
Spearman correlation values showed that MRI had a
greater agreement with PE in assessing tumor size (r ¼
0.559) than MG (r ¼ 0.046).
At the end of the neoadjuvant treatment, 23 patients
had all 3 clinical measurements including PE, MG, and
MRI, and subsequent pathologic measurements of the residual tumors (Table 2). Thirty-nine had tumor measurements by PE and final pathology (the definitive
measurement of tumor size), with a median tumor size of
2.0 cm by PE (range, 0-11 cm) and 3 cm by pathology.
Median measurement by MG (n ¼ 28) was 1.5 cm
(range, 0-12 cm) and 2.1 cm by pathology. The 34
patients with MRI and pathology size yielded a median
measurement of 2.6 cm (range, 0-11 cm), 3.0 cm by
pathology.
Given the data in Table 3, it may appear that MRI is
superior to PE in assessing postneoadjuvant tumor measurements, as the difference in median tumor size by MRI

is 0.4 cm as compared with the 1.0-cm difference by PE.
However, postneoadjuvant PE actually had a smaller
RMSE. If there was perfect agreement between the measurement in question and the gold standard (eg, PE minus
pathology measurement), all the differences would be
zero, making the mean difference zero, the SD of the differences zero, and the RMSE zero. Compared with final
pathologic findings, PE, MG, and MRI had an RMSE of
3.1, 3.8, and 3.5, respectively. PE had a Spearman correlation value of 0.655, which was shown to correlate the best
with pathological measurement (Table 4), and it was
slightly better than MRI. Although the RMSE for postneoadjuvant PE versus final pathology differences was
smaller than that of postneoadjuvant MRI, the PE differences were more biased, with a 1.2-cm bias for PE as
opposed to the 0.2-cm bias (mean difference) for MRI.
Eleven of the 45 patients had a complete pathologic
response (pCR) of the primary cancer. All of the pCR
cases were T3 invasive ductal carcinomas (24.4%), and
were mainly ER/PR (55%), high grade (73%), with
no lymphovascular invasion (82%) (Table 5). Two of
these patients with no residual cancer had positive lymph
nodes by PET scan and were lymph node negative by PE.

calcifications on the mammographies was found in 5
patients with pathologic complete response. Of the
patients with pathologic complete response, 9 had postneoadjuvant MRI evaluation, and only 2 patients were
correctly predicted by a negative MRI.
Our study suggested that clinically positive axillary
lymph nodes found by either postneoadjuvant PE or PET
were suggestive of pathologically positive lymph nodes.
Three patients did not undergo postneoadjuvant chemotherapy PET scan, and 1 patient had a study deemed not
evaluable by the radiologist. All patients were assessed by
PE for postneoadjuvant chemotherapy nodal status. Seventy percent of lymph node–positive patients by PE or
PET were proven to have pathologic positive lymph nodes
(Table 6). In contrast, only 41% of patients (17 of the 41
patients by PE and 14 of the 35 patients by PET) with
clinically negative axilla had true pathologic negative
lymph nodes.

Therefore, pathologically negative lymph nodes
were poorly predicted by either modality alone or in combination. In addition, the negative findings on PE and/or
PET did not predict a negative finding on pathology; that
is, the 41 ‘‘lymph node–negative’’ patients identified by
postchemotherapy PE did not wholly contain the 35 PET
‘‘lymph node–negative’’ patients.
We found very high specificity (94% and 88%)
associated with both postchemotherapy PE and PET for
predicting negative lymph nodes and low sensitivity (11%
and 16%, respectively) for predicting positive lymph
nodes, with an accuracy of 52% by the 2 modalities.
When compared with postneoadjuvant evaluation, baseline PE and PET were found to be more accurate in predicting pathology lymph node status: PE had 65%
accuracy, with 56% specificity and 74% sensitivity,
whereas PET had 72% accuracy, with 63% specificity and
81% sensitivity (Table 7).

DISCUSSION
Tumor assessment is important both in planning the
initial treatment course and in monitoring disease
response to the treatment. Baseline assessment of a palpable breast cancer can steer the treatment decision either toward or away from the option of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. Should neoadjuvant chemotherapy be
chosen, monitoring tumor response to treatment by
assessing the residual tumor size is essential to determine
the best course of surgical action. Monitoring and
assessment, however, rely on the relative accuracy of
available clinical tools.
Tumor measurement at baseline by PE was used as
reference to judge the relative accuracy of MG against
MRI. Our results found MRI to hold closer to PE

measurements than MG. Furthermore, the tumor measurements by PE were possible in all, whereas almost 1
third of the mammograms were not evaluable or not
measureable. Our study suggested that MG should not be
the sole breast imaging study in patients with T3 or T4
breast cancer.
Some studies have found all 3 correlate well with
final pathologic findings.10 Others have shown PE to have
a higher predictive value.11 Recently, MRI was found to
have the highest correlative value.2,4,5,6,12,13 Many data
from direct comparisons between PE, MG, and MRI
highlight MRI as the most accurate way to assess residual
tumor size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but other
studies disagree.2-6,14
When compared with the pathologically measured
tumor size, the absolute superiority of MRI for tumor
assessment was not confirmed in the postneoadjuvant
chemotherapy setting in these women. Previous studies
have touted MRI as the most accurate way of assessing residual disease when compared with final pathology measurements in populations including patients not limited to
locally advanced disease.2-6,15,16 Partridge et al found
MRI to be exceedingly accurate (MRI correlation with pathology: r ¼ 0.89 vs r ¼ 0.6 for PE correlation with pathology) despite reduced tumor contrast uptake after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.15 Londero et al reported
MRI capable of accurately evaluating the extent of residual tumor in 80% of patients, a superior rate, when compared with the accuracy of MG in their study (53%).2
Similar to Yeh et al, they implicated postchemotherapeutic fibroglandular changes as the main reason for the inaccuracies frequently associated with mammographic
findings.4 Such fibrotic tissues can confound PE findings
as well, as Balu-Maestro et al postulated in their study of
51 patients comparing PE, MG, ultrasound, and MRI
before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.5
In this study, we found PE to be a reliable method
to evaluate size of residual breast carcinoma, reinforcing
Rieber et al’s observation that MRI is a less reliable evaluation in determining size of residual cancer.8 Our study
indicated that MRI might overestimate the residual tumor
among patients with a complete pathologic response.
Complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
was also assessed most accurately by PE. In our study, 6 of
the patients with complete response had apparent residual
disease on MG, and 7 complete responders had measura1200

ble disease on MRIs. In contrast to the study by Schott et
al, who reported MRI to be the most accurate in the determination of pathologic complete response,14 a complete
response by PE appeared in our study to be the best predictor of pathologic complete response. However, Schott
et al had only 4 patients with a complete pathologic
response, and they suggested that the high sensitivity and
low specificity of MRI might be superior in patient
cohorts unlikely to achieve complete response. Therefore,
MRI may be less accurate in a population with a higher
pathologic complete response rate.
Given the body of evidence that supports the utility
and specificity of MRI imaging, our results should be
interpreted as reinforcing the importance of PE by experienced practitioners rather than detracting from the role of
MRI in patient management. PE findings, particularly
the large primary breast cancer assessment, remain essential in treatment decision-making and not to be omitted
and replaced by the measurements garnered from imaging
technologies.
In women with locally advanced disease, large
tumors are often accompanied by axillary lymph node
involvement. Disease staging, especially in this population, necessitates accurate assessment of lymph node status. FDG-PET is an emerging technology that has the
potential to provide valuable staging information and possibly predict tumor response, but its role in the evaluation
of lymph node involvement after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yet to be clearly defined. The PET scan has been
shown to have low sensitivity when compared with both
axillary lymph node dissection and sentinel lymph node
biopsy.17,18 Nonetheless, the positive predictive value and
high specificity of the PET scan would still be valuable in
staging patients with more advanced disease and guiding
the choice of surgical management of the axilla.17,19 Inoue
et al found encouraging results, showing PET scan to have
higher specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node status than PE.20 FDG-PET
was more accurate in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node
status than PE. We also examined lymph node assessment
by PE and FDG-PET and compared negative and positive
findings to patients’ lymph node staging by pathology.
Our results showed PE and PET scan after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy to be highly specific, but poor for sensitivity and accuracy. This is comparable to the results
reported by Fehr et al, who also found a sensitivity of 20%

Accuracy of Breast Cancer Evaluation/Prati et al

and a specificity of 93% for nodal assessment by PET.21
Although these results might suggest that PET scan has an
inherent low sensitivity after neoadjuvant treatment,
others have reported sensitivity rates of up to 100%.18 In
our study, baseline PET and PE were shown to be more
accurate and sensitive in predicting the final nodal status
than the postneoadjuvant evaluation by either PE or PET,
but none was sufficient to replace pathologic staging.
Limitations of our study included a small cohort of
patients, using only the longest dimension for tumor size
determination, which may not be the best way to measure
tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and heterogeneous medical teams at numerous clinical sites that
participated in this study.
In summary, tumor assessment in patients with
locally advanced breast cancer by PE is accurate, clinically
useful, and can be attained in all patients. Our study suggests that breast cancer size determined by PE in these
women is highly accurate when compared with breast
imaging and pathology finding. The varied experiences of
different physicians and the retrospective nature of many
studies may all play a role in the relative unreliability
found by some reports. In addition, pathologic lymph
node staging is still necessary even when PE and PET are
negative. Further studies focusing on the role of FDGPET in breast disease assessment are warranted.
