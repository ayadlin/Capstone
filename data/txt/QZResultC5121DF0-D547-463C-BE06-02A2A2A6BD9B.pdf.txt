BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have demonstrated that escalated-dose external-beam radiotherapy (EDRT) is better than standard-dose radiotherapy (SDRT) for patients with prostate cancer and that adding androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) to SDRT is better than SDRT alone; however, no trials have compared EDRT versus SDRT plus ADT or EDRT versus EDRT plus ADT. The authors
designed a model to estimate the results of various doses of radiotherapy (RT) combined with various durations of ADT. METHODS:
From 1989 to 2007, 3215 men consecutively received definitive EDRT with or without ADT. In total, 2012 patients had complete
records available for creating the nomogram. The duration of ADT varied for patients who received no RT (n ¼ 1562), 6 months of
RT (n ¼ 145), from >6 months to <24 months of RT (n ¼ 140), and 24 months of RT (n ¼ 165) with a median follow-up of 65.7
months, 66.2 months, 60.1 months, and 63 months, respectively. The model included the following covariates: palpation T-category,
biopsy Gleason score, the percentage of tumor cells with a Gleason pattern of 4 or 5, the percentage of tumor tissue, initial pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, ADT duration, and RT dose. Two nomograms, for outcomes with and without ADT, were
created from a single competing-risks model. Biochemical failure was defined as a rise in serum PSA of 2 ng/mL over the post-treatment PSA nadir. RESULTS: According to the results from analyzing representative intermediate-risk to high-risk patient parameters,
the gains from increasing the RT dose from 70 Gray (Gy) to 80 Gy were far less than the gains from adding 3 months of ADT. CONCLUSIONS: The nomograms provided unique patient-specific estimates of the effects of various doses and durations of RT and ADT.
The results indicated that adding ADT to treatment for intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer is far more beneficial than a

INTRODUCTION
External-beam radiotherapy (RT) is commonly used to treat nonmetastatic prostate cancer with curative intent. Several
randomized studies have demonstrated that escalated-dose RT (EDRT) without androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is
more effective than standard-dose RT (SDRT) in providing long-term biochemical control.1,2 Thus, EDRT has become
standard at most institutions.
Other randomized trials have indicated that the addition of ADT to SDRT improves both biochemical control and
survival in patients with intermediate-risk to high-risk prostate cancer.3,4 In high-risk patients who received SDRT,
extending the length of androgen deprivation from 4 to 6 months to 2.5 to 3.0 years also was effective.5,6 However, to our
knowledge, no reported randomized trials have compared EDRT versus SDRT plus ADT or EDRT versus EDRT plus
ADT. Consequently, there is considerable variability in the management of prostate cancer with external-beam RT.
Although nomograms have been developed to estimate the outcome of patients who receive RT,7 none have estimated the
impact of the length of ADT on patients who receive escalated RT doses. The objective of the current study was to develop
a prediction tool that incorporates contemporary clinical and pathologic parameters to assist clinicians and patients in estimating the potential gains in biochemical control from adding various lengths of ADT to EDRT or SDRT.

also excluded 10 patients who had received <60 Gray
(Gy).
Radiotherapy and Androgen-Deprivation
Therapy
Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy

Patients who had a clinical T-category of T1/T2aT2b and a Gleason score of 2 to 6 typically received treatment to the prostate with or without the proximal seminal
vesicles. Patients who had more advanced prostate cancer
(T2c/T3/T4 or Gleason score 7–10) received 46 to 50 Gy
to a small pelvic field followed by a conformal boost to
the prostate and seminal vesicles.8 The mean dose to the
patient treatment volume (PTV) was typically between
5% and þ7% of the prescribed dose, and 99% of the
PTV received at least 95% of the prescribed dose.
Intensity-modulated radiotherapy

The primary clinical target volume (CTV1)
included the prostate, any extraprostatic extension, and
the proximal seminal vesicles, defined as the first approximately 9 mm of the proximal seminal vesicles. In highrisk patients, additional volumes were defined. CTV2
comprised the distal seminal vesicles, and CTV3 comprised the periprostatic, periseminal vesicle, external iliac,
obturator, and internal iliac lymph nodes. PTV margins
were 8 mm in all dimensions except posterior (5 mm).

The dose was prescribed to the PTV volumes, such that
the PTV1 was planned to receive 95% of the prescription dose, and the PTV2 and PTV3 were planned to
receive 95% of 56 Gy over the full treatment course.9
ADT was received by 450 men in the study group
and was prescribed at the discretion of the treating physician. This consisted of a luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) agonist and/or an antiandrogen. The
LHRH agonist was received by 434 men and consisted of
leuprolide or goserelin depot injections. This was received
in combination with an antiandrogen (eg, bicalutamide,
flutamide, or nilutamide) at the outset by 229 patients.
An additional 16 patients received an antiandrogen alone.
The duration of ADT was used as a continuous covariate
in the model. For purposes of illustration, 1562 patients
received no ADT (none), 145 received ADT for 6
months (short term), 140 patients received ADT for >6
months to <24 months (intermediate term), and 165
patients received ADT for 24 months (long term); the
median ADT duration in each group was 0 months, 3
months, 12 months, and 29 months, respectively.
Statistical Analysis and Model Development

Analyses of variance and chi-square tests were used to
compare variables between the ADT subgroups (Table 1).
Two nomograms—1 with ADT and 1 without ADT—
were created from a single Fine and Gray competing-risks
model. These nomograms predicted the probability of
biochemical failure (BF) at 8 years after RT. BF was
defined using the PSA-based ‘‘nadir þ 2 ng/mL’’
1081

definition and was derived from the cumulative incidence
function, conditional on a set of disease-related patient
characteristics. Specifically, the percentage of tumor cells
with a Gleason pattern of 4 or 5 (%GP4/5),10 the percentage of biopsy tumor tissue that was positive for adenocarcinoma (PPT), the initial pretreatment PSA (iPSA) value,
ADT duration, and RT dose were used as continuous
covariates; whereas palpation T-category was used as a categorical variable. Gleason score was used as a categorical
variable in the no-ADT nomogram and as a continuous
variable in the ADT nomogram.
The PPT was calculated as the average percentage
of the tumor core length that was positive from each
region sampled; then, the average of all region percentages was calculated. For example, if sextant biopsies
were obtained and more cores were taken from 1 sextant over another, then the sextant percentage still
would have the same weighting as the other sextant
percentages.
In developing the nomogram, we used estimated
model coefficients to assign points to each characteristic,
and predictions from the model were used to map cumulative point totals to the probability of having the nadir þ
2 ng/mL outcome by 8 years. We used restricted cubic
splines as described by Harrell11 with 3 knots to model
PSA, PPT, and %GP4/5. Because these variables had a
large effect on BF, we believed it was important to use
splines to allow for nonlinear effects. For Gleason score in
the no-ADT model, we dichotomized the Gleason score
into 7 versus <7 to similarly account for nonlinearity.
We included interactions between all prognostic variables,
including spline transformation terms, and whether an
individual received any ADT. We also included main
effects terms for the duration of ADT. The model, hence,
allowed us to create 2 separate nomograms but also to
adjust predictions based on the duration of ADT (Fig. 1).
The probability of failure was determined as follows: For
each parameter, the location on the horizontal line for a
specific patient’s values is mapped to several points by referring down to the horizontal line labeled total points.
The points are then summed for each parameter to obtain
the total, which is mapped to a probability of BF at 8
years.
The variables were not bounded in the regression
model before fitting the models. However, for 3 variables
in which there were local regions of points estimates that
were nonmonotone or nearly flat, we selected bounding
points at or near the local minimum/maximum, at which
we believed there was no significant difference beyond the
bounding point (Fig. 2).
1082

The predictive accuracy of the model was assessed in
2 ways. First, the Harrell concordance statistic (C-statistic) for the Fine and Gray model11 was estimated using
the imputation methods of Ruan and Gray.12 Second, the
calibration method described by Kattan and colleagues
was used.13 For each individual, we predicted the probability of each outcome at 8 years after fitting the competing-risk regression using data only from the other 2012
individuals in the data set. We then averaged the predicted
probabilities from the model within quintiles defined by
the magnitude of the predictions. Within each quintile of
individuals, we estimated the marginal cumulative incidence of failure using the method described by Gray.14
We then plotted the marginal estimates versus the average
of the model predictions.
RESULTS
In total, 2012 patients were analyzed. Figure 3 illustrates
the unadjusted cumulative incidence BF curves divided
according to the length of ADT. Of the 263 men who had
BF, 56 developed distant metastases, and 237 died.
Patient characteristics are detailed according to the length
of ADT in Table 1. The median follow-up was 65.7
months, 66.2 months, 60.1 months, and 63 months for
those who received no RT, short-term RT, intermediateterm RT, and long-term ADT, respectively (P ¼ .0364).
In addition, as ADT duration increased, T-category,
Gleason score, %GP4/5, PPT and RT dose increased,
whereas the percentage of patients who received <76 Gy
decreased.
Figure 4 presents the results from model calibration.
The model is well calibrated because the average of the
predicted probabilities within each quintile is close to the
estimated marginal cumulative incidence probability and
falls on a 45-degree line. The Harrell C-statistic for the
model was 0.76.
The nomograms allow for estimates of the results
from various durations of ADT and RT dose by comparing the probabilities of failure. Table 2 provides example
case parameters to illustrate the potential of the nomograms. Patients were entered into the model assuming an
RT dose of 70 Gy or 80 Gy; however, other doses also
could be entered. The table indicates that the probabilities
are associated with a P value related to a comparison of
the use of no ADT versus a specified duration of ADT.
For illustrative purposes, a patient with a T1/T2 tumor, a
Gleason score of 7, an iPSA of 10 ng/mL, a %GP4/5 of
5%, and a PPT of 10% (Table 2, Example Patient A)
would be expected to experience a reduction in the 8-year
risk of BF from 40% to 35% by increasing the dose from

70 Gy to 80 Gy. Adding 6 months of ADT reduced the
BF rate to 20% and 18% for 70 Gy and 80 Gy, respectively. By comparison, a patient with the same T-category,
Gleason score, and iPSA but with a %GP4/5 of 30% and
a PPT of 50% (Table 2, Example Patient B) would be
expected to experience a drop in the 8 year BF rate from
81% to 75% by increasing the dose from 70 Gy to 80 Gy.
Adding 6 months of ADT reduced the 8-year BF rate by
over half to 38% and 34% for 70 Gy and 80 Gy,
respectively.
Table 2 also provides pairwise BF comparisons for no
ADT versus ADT for increasing lengths of time. In general,
the P values were more significant with higher tumor burden and iPSA, as observed by the P values for Example
Patients A, B, and C in Table 2. In addition, as the length of
ADT was increased, the significance increased.

associations between the 8 year BF risk and distant metastasis (Gray test for cumulative incidence; P < .0001) as
well as cause-specific death (P ¼ .009).
DISCUSSION
The American Joint Commission on Cancer uses pretreatment PSA, Gleason score, and T-category to classify a
patient’s risk of relapse into 4 groups. Such binned riskgroup associations are inherently heterogeneous. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that tumor burden parameters (eg, the percentage positive biopsies or the
percentage positive tumor tissue) are significant determinants of prostate cancer outcome and are not included in
the American Joint Commission on Cancer groupings. A
patient who has a high Gleason score with low volume, a
low T-category, and a low pretreatment PSA level may
have a lower risk of BF than a patient who has an

have devised takes this a step further by providing for estimate of the impact of treatment parameters, such as RT
dose and length of ADT.
Several nomograms have been described to predict
the risk of failure after prostatectomy or RT15; however,
there are limitations and caveats.16 Only some of these
have incorporated biopsy variables, such as the percentage
positive biopsy cores (PPC) or the percentage biopsy tissue positive for adenocarcinoma (PPT). In a surgical series
by Freedland et al, PPT predicted outcome to a greater
degree than PSA or Gleason score in the patients who
underwent radical prostatectomy.17 Although PPC has
been predictive of outcome in RT series, as reported by
D’Amico et al18 and others, the men in those earlier
reports received low RT doses (median dose, 70.4 Gy;
range, 69.3-70.4 Gy). Williams et al7 reported that PPC
discriminated poorly in men who received higher doses.
Our experience is that PPT is a better predictor of BF
than PPC for men who receive doses >72 Gy. Therefore,
PPT, and not PPC, was included as a covariate representing tumor burden in our nomogram.
Several surgical series have demonstrated that the biopsy tissue %GP4/5 is associated significantly with outcome.19 The %GP4/5 was related to biochemical and
clinical outcome independent of RT dose, T-category,
iPSA, Gleason score 3 þ 4, or Gleason score 4 þ 3 disease
classification.10 On the basis of these data, %GP4/5 was

included in the model. The %GP4/5 is available for most
patients; the primary Gleason pattern, secondary Gleason
pattern, and percentage core length involvement is all that
is needed to calculate the %GP4/5.10
A strength of our analysis is that no variable selection
was done; rather, all variables of interest were entered into
the model and are reported as such. To our knowledge,
this is the first nomogram to incorporate %GP4/5 and
PPT, each of which has demonstrated independent predictive value, but neither of which has previously been
entered into a nomogram.
The second important component of the nomogram
is its design, which factors the impact of RT dose and the
length of ADT into outcome estimates. Both RT dose and
neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT reduce long-term BF, but
there are no published randomized trials incorporating
both for the treatment of prostate cancer. Thus, the anticipated benefit is largely left up to the subjective impression
of the treating physician. The nomogram would be a useful
guide, and the Example Patients in Table 2 are illustrative.
The data indicate that, in terms of reducing BF, the gains
are far greater when ADT is added compared with going
from 70 Gy to 80 Gy. The data from randomized trials
support this relationship from the perspective that RT has
rarely been shown to have a survival impact,20 whereas the
addition of ADT to standard doses of RT has much more
consistently been related to improvements in survival.5–9
Of note, we did not include pelvic lymph node treatment
as 1 of the covariates in the model, because close to 90% of
the high-risk patients received such treatment.
Another correlation that we observed by applying
the nomogram to hypothetical patients was that for most,
short (6 months) to intermediate (from >6 months to
<2 years) term ADT would be favored over extending
ADT to 2 years or more. There are no randomized trials

comparing 1 year to 2 years of ADT directly; however, the
results with 2 to 3 years of androgen deprivation have
been much more consistently positive than those comparing 6 months to 1 year.
Using 8-year BF as the main endpoint allowed us to
draw conclusions about long-term efficacy; however, does
not consider the potential for effects of salvage ADT survival after ADT. We approached this question by examining the association between the 8-year BF risk and distant
metastasis and cause-specific death (Fig. 5). Strong correlations were observed, supporting the supposition that the
BF endpoint estimates translate into long-term clinical
outcome consequences.
In summary, a novel dual-nomogram prediction
tool was devised that provides individualized estimates of
the relative effects of dose escalation and various durations
of ADT. This prediction tool incorporated newer measures of tumor burden and Gleason grade to estimate the
8-year risk of BF. Such a tool would be a useful as an
adjunct to physicians and patients in decision-making and
also could be incorporated into the design of clinical protocol eligibility and/or stratification.
