c-MET Inhibition

Abstract
The receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET is the high-afﬁnity receptor for the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The
HGF/c-MET axis is often dysregulated in tumors. c-MET activation can be caused by MET gene ampliﬁcation,
activating mutations, and auto- or paracrine mechanisms. Thus, c-MET inhibitors are under development as
anticancer drugs. Tivantinib (ARQ 197) was reported as a small-molecule c-MET inhibitor and early clinical
studies suggest antitumor activity. To assess whether the antitumor activity of tivantinib was due to inhibition of
c-MET, we compared the activity of tivantinib with other c-MET inhibitors in both c-MET–addicted and
nonaddicted cancer cells. As expected, other c-MET inhibitors, crizotinib and PHA-665752, suppressed the growth
of c-MET-addicted cancers, but not the growth of cancers that are not addicted to c-MET. In contrast, tivantinib
inhibited cell viability with similar potency in both c-MET-addicted and nonaddicted cells. These results suggest
that tivantinib exhibits its antitumor activity in a manner independent of c-MET status. Tivantinib treatment
induced a G2–M cell-cycle arrest in EBC1 cells similarly to vincristine treatment, whereas PHA-665752 or
crizotinib treatment markedly induced G0–G1 cell-cycle arrest. To identify the additional molecular target of
tivantinib, we conducted COMPARE analysis, an in silico screening of a database of drug sensitivities across 39
cancer cell lines (JFCR39), and identiﬁed microtubule as a target of tivantinib. Tivantinib-treated cells showed
typical microtubule disruption similar to vincristine and inhibited microtubule assembly in vitro. These results
suggest that tivantinib inhibits microtubule polymerization in addition to inhibiting c-MET. Cancer Res; 73(10);

Introduction
The met proto-oncogene (c-MET) was originally identiﬁed from N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-treated
human osteosarcoma cell lines. MET is an activated oncogene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also called scatter factor (1). The
HGF/c-MET–signaling pathway is frequently dysregulated
in human cancer (2). Aberrant activation of c-MET can be
due to gene ampliﬁcation, transcriptional upregulation,

activating mutations, or HGF-mediated auto- or paracrine
stimulation. Activation of c-MET pathway by coexpression
of HGF and c-MET was shown to drive tumorigenesis and
metastasis in xenograft models and in transgenic mouse
models (3). Although HGF/c-MET axis has been associated
with metastasis and migration of cancer cells (3, 4), recent
studies have shown that some cancers are addicted to the
pathway for their growth and survival. In particular, cancers
with ampliﬁcation of c-MET have been shown to be highly
sensitive to c-MET kinase inhibitors in cell lines and in the
clinic (5–7). In addition, HGF/c-MET pathway was associated with the acquired resistance to inhibitors to EGF receptor (EGFR) in EGFR mutant non–small cell lung cancers
(NSCLC; refs. 8–11). Thus, inhibitors of c-MET have been
pursued as therapeutic interventions in oncology. Many lowmolecular inhibitors of c-MET and monoclonal antibodies
against c-MET and HGF are now entering clinical trials.
Tivantinib (ARQ 197) was initially reported as a c-MET
selective inhibitor in 2010 (12) and entered into clinical trials
(13–18). In the initial report, tivantinib inhibited recombinant human c-MET with a calculated inhibitory constant
(Ki) of approximately 355 nmol/L and had weak inhibitory
effects on p21-activated kinase 3, VEGF receptor-3 (Flt4),
calmodulin-dependent kinase II delta, and Pim-1. Tivantinib
did not inhibit any of the other 225 human kinases tested,
including the Ron kinase, which belongs to the c-MET family
of RTKs. The crystal structure of the tivantinib in complex

with the c-MET kinase domain revealed that tivantinib binds
to the inactive form of c-MET, suggesting that it inhibits cMET through a non-ATP–competitive mechanism (19). This
suggested that inhibitory mode of action is different from
the disclosed c-MET inhibitors under preclinical and clinical
development. Recent clinical trial results suggest that tivantinib may be active in KRAS-mutant lung cancers, which is
not a cancer type identiﬁed in other preclinical studies to be
dependent on c-MET signaling (16). In addition, a recent
study found that tivantinib was equally potent against MKN45 cells (with MET ampliﬁcation) and NCI-H460 cells (KRAS
mutation and no MET ampliﬁcation; ref. 12), although a
different study found that another c-MET inhibitor PHA665752 was effective only in the MKN-45 cells (7). In this
study, we aimed to determine whether the toxicity of tivantinib is solely due to inhibition of c-MET, and found that this
was not the case. Thus, we sought to determine whether
tivantinib inhibits additional target molecules or pathways
in the cells. We previously established the COMPARE analysis, which consists of the sensitivity data of a panel of 39
cancer cell lines (termed JFCR39) against numerous drugs
(20–24). The COMPARE analysis enables us to putatively
identify the molecular target of a test compound by comparing the growth inhibitory patterns (ﬁngerprints) of
JFCR39 with those of the known anticancer drug or compounds (24–27). Here, we used COMPARE in silico screening
to identify additional molecular targets of tivantinib that
may lend insights into its indiscriminatory activity.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
EBC1, MKN45, SNU638, A549, NCI-H460, HCC827, SNU-5,
BT-474, and SKBR3 were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with
10% FBS (RPMI growth medium). SNU638 subclones, SR-A1
and SR-C1 cells, were cultured in RPMI growth medium
containing 1 mmol/L of a c-MET inhibitor PHA-665752 as
described previously (28). SR-A1 and SR-C1 cells were cultured
at least 1 week in drug-free RPMI growth medium before
experiments. Tivantinib (ARQ 197) and crizotinib were purchased from ChemieTek. PHA-665752 was purchased from
Tocris Biosciences. Vincristine and paclitaxel were purchased
from Sigma. Compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mmol/L and stored at 20 C
until use.
Survival assays
Assessment of cell viability was conducted as follows. A
total of 2,000–3,000 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in
sextuplet. On the following day, cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of the indicated drugs and incubated for another 72 hours. Cell viability was determined by
adding the CellTiter-Glo assay reagent (Promega) for 10
minutes and luminescence was measured using a Centro
LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies). The data were
graphically displayed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0
(GraphPad Software). IC50 value was determined by a nonlinear regression model with a sigmoidal dose response in
GraphPad.

Immunoblot analysis
Lysates were prepared as described previously (9, 29). Equal
amounts of lysates were electrophoresed and immunoblotted
with the antibodies against phospho-c-MET (Tyr1234/1235)
(3D7), c-MET (25H2), phospho-p42/44 extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK; Thr202/Tyr204), p42/44 ERK/MAPK, phospho-AKT
(Ser473; D9E), AKT1 (C73H10), b-actin (13E5; Cell Signaling
Technology), and a-tubulin (DM1A; Sigma).
Infection of shRNA
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates. After incubation for 24
hours, cells were infected with MET short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA; MET KD 345 shRNA and MET KD 4571 shRNA) or
scramble shRNA (9, 28). Media was changed the following day.
Three days later, cell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo
assay as described above. Titers of virus were used that gave the
same results in the absence and presence of puromycin.
Immunohistochemistry
EBC1 or A549 cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15
minutes at room temperature, followed by 0.5% Triton X-100
for 5 minutes at room temperature. Fixed and permeabilized
cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for
60 minutes at room temperature. Then, cells were incubated
with anti-a-tubulin (1:1,000) as the primary antibody over
night at 4 C and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse
immunoglobulin G (1:1,000) as the secondary antibody with
Hoechst 33342 and Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated pharoidine for 1
hour at room temperature. The cells were observed under an
Olympus IX71 ﬂuorescence microscopy equipped with a
charge-coupled device camera.
COMPARE analysis
On the basis of a series of GI50 values of a panel of 39 human
cancer cell lines (termed JFCR39) described previously, ﬁngerprints are presented in the graphic proﬁles of relative growth
inhibition within JFCR39. To analyze the correlation between
the ﬁngerprints of drug A and drug B, we exploited the
COMPARE computer algorithm as described previously
(23, 27, 30). The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between the
ﬁngerprints of drug A and drug B was calculated.
Microtubule polymerization assay
Porcine brain tubulin polymerization assay was conducted
in 55 mL volumes at 30 C using the Tubulin Polymerization
Assay Kit (Cytoskeleton) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Tubulin preparation was incubated at 30 C in
the presence of inhibitors (tivantinib, vincristine, paclitaxel,
crizotinib, or PHA-665752). Fluorescence emission was read at
excitation (355 nm) and emission (460 nm) with a TriStar
LB941 plate reader (Berthold Technologies) every minute right
after starting incubation.
Flow cytometric analysis
Cells were treated with indicated concentration of tivantinib, vincristine, PHA-665752, or crizotinib for 24 hours. After
incubation, the cells were harvested and ﬁxed with 70%

ice-cold ethanol for 30 minutes at 4 C. The cells were washed
with PBS and then incubated with RNaseA (0.25 mg/mL,
Sigma) for 15 minutes at 37 C, add propidium iodide (ﬁnal
concentration is 50 mg/mL, Sigma) and incubate for 30 minutes
at 4 C. Analyses were conducted using a Cytomics 500 ﬂow
cytometer (Beckman Coulter) with a Cytomics RXP and FlowJo
(Treestar) software.
Apoptosis assay
A total of 1  105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. On the
following day, cells were treated with the indicated concentration of drugs and incubated for another 48 or 72 hours. After
incubation, cells were collected and stained with ﬂuorescein
isothiocyante-labeled AnnexinV and 5 mg/mL propidium
iodide for 10 minutes. Cells were then assayed using a Cytomics
500 ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter), and the data were
analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar).

Results
Tivantinib inhibits the growth of both c-MET–dependent
and -independent cancer cells
To examine whether the antiproliferative activity of tivantinib was due to inhibition of c-MET, we examined cancer cell
lines previously shown to be addicted to c-MET and sensitive to
c-MET inhibitors (NSCLC cell line EBC1 and gastric carcinoma
cell lines MKN45 and SNU638) and NSCLC cell lines previously
shown to be resistant to c-MET inhibitors, A549, NCI-H460
(H460), and HCC827 (9, 10, 28). As shown in Supplementary
Table S1, EBC1 and MKN45 have MET gene ampliﬁcation. The
c-MET–addicted SNU638 cells do not have MET ampliﬁcation,
but express levels of c-MET equivalent to those cell lines
with MET gene ampliﬁcation (28). The resistant A549 and
H460 cells harbor KRAS mutations, and HCC827 cells have an
EGFR exon 19 deletion. As expected, the expression levels of

Tyr1234/Tyr1235-phosphorylated and total c-MET were higher
in the EBC1, MKN45, and SNU638 compared with A549, H460,
and HCC827 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Of note, the
EGFR-addicted HCC827 cell line has high expression of
c-MET as well (Supplementary Fig. S1A), but they are driven
by EGFR signaling and are resistant to c-MET inhibitors (9).
Consistent with the previous data with c-MET kinase inhibitors, we found that the viability EBC1, MKN45 and SNU638
cells was impaired by MET knockdown, but the viability A549,
H460, and HCC827 cells was unaffected (Supplementary
Fig. S1B and S1C). These results are consistent with the
expected ﬁnding that EBC1, MKN45, and SNU638 require
c-MET, but A549, H460, and HCC827 do not.
These cell lines were examined for sensitivity to 3 c-MET
inhibitors, tivantinib, PHA-665752, or crizotinib. Unexpectedly,
tivantinib inhibited cell viability in all of the cell lines examined
(Fig. 1A). In contrast, the other 2 c-MET inhibitors, PHA-665752
and crizotinib, inhibited cell viability speciﬁcally in the cancer
cell lines that were shown to be c-MET dependent in the shRNA
experiments (Fig. 1B and C). Similar analyses were conducted
on the MET-ampliﬁed gastric carcinoma cell line SNU-5 and
the HER2-ampliﬁed BT-474 and SKBR3 breast cancer cell lines
(Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). As
shown in Fig. 1D, tivantinib is equally potent at diminishing
cell viability in cancers cell lines regardless of their dependence
on c-MET, whereas the other 2 c-MET inhibitors show substantially greater potency in the cancers driven by c-MET (Fig.
1D and Supplementary Table S2). These data suggest that the
toxicity of tivantinib against cancer cell lines may be independent of inhibition of c-MET. Importantly, the IC50 values
obtained with tivantinib in these cell lines are equivalent to
those reported in earlier publications (12).
In previous studies, we had developed clones of SNU638 with
acquired resistance to PHA-665752 (28). Both of these clones

showed resistance to both PHA-665752 and crizotinib (Fig.
2A and B). One of these clones, SR-A1, developed a mutation,
Y1230H that was the cause of resistance. Another clone, SRC1, was resistant due to increased activation of EGFR
resulting from increased expression of TGFa (28). In these
cells, c-MET was still inhibited by PHA-665752, but EGFR
signaling maintained cell viability. Furthermore, the viability
of these cells were unaffected by MET knockdown (28). We
observed that both of the c-MET inhibitor-resistant clones
showed the same sensitivity to tivantinib (Fig. 2C and D and
Supplementary Table S2). This was surprising because viability of the SR-C1 clone is not dependent on c-MET (28).
These data are consistent with studies in Fig. 1 suggesting
that sensitivity to tivantinib is independent of a cell's dependence on c-MET.
Tivantinib does not suppress c-MET phosphorylation
and downstream signaling
To examine the effect of tivantinib on c-MET signaling,
MKN45, EBC1, and A549 cells were treated with the increasing
concentrations of tivantinib or crizotinib (Fig. 3A). The ﬁrst 2
cell lines are addicted to c-MET signaling, whereas the A549
cells are not (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). After exposure
to 1 mmol/L of crizotinib for 6 hours, there was a marked
downregulation of phosphorylation of c-MET and downstream
AKT and ERK in MKN45 and EBC1 cells (Fig. 3A). Previous
studies have shown that the PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK signaling
are downstream of c-MET in these sensitive cells (7, 9). However, phospho-c-MET was undetectable in the A549 cells and
crizotinib did not suppress ERK or AKT phosphorylation. In
contrast, tivantinib, used at doses up to 10 mmol/L, failed to
impair c-MET, AKT, or ERK phosphorylation in the EBC1 or
MKN45 cells. Of note, the IC50 of tivantinib was 300 to 400
nmol/L in these cells (Supplementary Table S2), despite the

lack of effect on c-MET phosphorylation or downstream
signaling.
When the cells were treated with tivantinib or crizotinib for
24 hours, 1 mmol/L crizotinib potently suppressed c-MET, AKT,
and ERK phosphorylation in the MKN45, EBC1, and SNU638
cells. In contrast, tivantinib moderately decreased the phospho-c-MET level in MKN45 and EBC1 cells but not in SNU638
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Not surprisingly, there was no
suppression of AKT in these cell lines and a modest suppression of ERK in the EBC1 cells treated with tivatinib (up to 10
mmol/L). However, all of these cell lines, including the A549
cells, had submicromolar sensitivity to the tivantinib (Supplementary Table S2). Similar to the results in Figs. 1 and 2, these
results are most consistent with the notion that the effect of
tivantinib on cell viability is not solely due to inhibition of
c-MET.
A recent report suggests that tivantinib selectively binds to
the inactive or unphosphorylated form of c-MET, preventing it
from being activated (19). To test whether tivantinib keeps cMET in inactive form in cells, MKN45 cells were pretreated
with 100 nmol/L of crizotinib for 6 hours to suppress c-MET
phosphorylation. Pretreatment with crizotinib substantially
downregulated the phospho-c-MET level within 6 hours (Fig.
3B). Washout of the crizotinib with fresh medium led to
reactivation of c-MET within 15 minutes. Coincubation of
tivantinib (up to 10 mmol/L) plus 100 nmol/L of crizotinib for
6 hours also suppressed the phosphorylation of c-MET in
MKN45 cells. Surprisingly, washout and continued incubation
of the cells with medium containing 10 mmol/L of tivantinib
failed to prevent reactivation of c-MET phosphorylation. The
reactivation of c-MET was almost the same as observed after
wash and additional incubation in the medium containing
none (fresh media). When A549 cells, which express c-MET but
not phospho-c-MET (Supplementary Fig. S1A), were treated

with HGF ligand, phospho-c-MET level was increased and
downstream AKT/ERK signaling was also signiﬁcantly activated. We did observe that tivantinib pretreatment moderately
inhibited HGF-dependent c-MET activation in A549 cells
(Suplementary Fig. S4). These results suggest that tivantinib
may have the capacity to mitigate c-MET activation following
HGF activation. However, the results in Figs. 1–3 show that this
activity is not the major mechanism underlying the inhibition
of cell viability.
Tivantinib treatment increases G2–M phase cells
To elucidate the mechanism by which tivantinib inhibits cell
growth, we conducted cell-cycle analyses after tivantinib treatment. MET-ampliﬁed EBC1 cells were treated with 1 mmol/L of
tivantinib, PHA-665752, and crizotinib for 24 hours, and the cell
cycles were examined by propidium iodide staining. To our
surprise, tivantinib markedly increased the number of G2–M
phase cells, whereas the other 2 c-MET inhibitors, crizotinib
and PHA-665752, induced G0–G1 arrest (Fig. 4A). The effect on
cell cycle of tivantinib was more similar to vincristine, a
microtubule polymerization inhibitor (31). When MET-ampliﬁed EBC1 or MKN45 cells were treated with tivantinib, vincristine, or crizotinib for 48 to 72 hours, induction of apoptosis
was observed (Supplementary Fig. S5). The A549 or H460 cells,
both of which are resistant to c-MET inhibitors and MET
knockdown, were treated with 1 mmol/L of tivantinib, PHA-

665752, crizotinib, and vincristine for 24 hours, and the cell
cycles were analyzed. Tivantinib treatment markedly increased
the number of G2–M phase cells and sub-G1 population,
whereas the other 2 c-MET inhibitors, crizotinib and PHA665752 did not affect the cell cycle (Supplementary Fig. S6A and
S6B).
To identify the genuine target of tivantinib, we conducted
COMPARE analysis using the JFCR39 cell line panel. The
JFCR39 panel is effective for in silico screening of compounds
with speciﬁc pharmacologic activities. There is an extensive
database assessing the activity of more than 1,000 compounds,
including anticancer drugs and known inhibitors of various
biologic pathways, across the JFCR39 cell line panel. Using this
JFCR39 panel ﬁngerprint, which is created by a series of GI50
value among the JFCR39 cell lines, we can determine potential
targets of tests molecules. We have successfully identiﬁed the
target of new compounds, such as a new telomerase inhibitor
(FJ5002), an inhibitor of the Golgi system (AMF-26) and a new
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (ZSTK474;
refs. 25–27). From the results of COMPARE analysis, we
observed that the ﬁngerprint of tivantinib is similar to that
of E7010 and vincristine (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S7). In
contrast, the ﬁngerprints of other 2 c-MET inhibitors PHA665752 and crizotinib are mutually similar, but different from
tivantinib, E7010, or vincristine. The COMPARE analysis of the
tivantinib ﬁngerprint identiﬁed the tubulin polymerization

Tivantinib (ARQ 197) Inhibits Tubulin Polymerization

inhibitor E7010 (32) as the compound with a highest correlation coefﬁcient (r ¼ 0.74; 1,805 tests, more than 1,000 compounds). Vincristine and paclitaxel ranked second and third,
respectively, also had high-correlation coefﬁcients (Fig. 4C).
All of these compounds target microtubule function. These
results suggest that tivantinib may disrupt microtubule and
suppress growth of the tumor cells.
Tivantinib disrupts microtubule by inhibiting tubulin
polymerization
To test whether tivantinib alters microtubule dynamics, cMET nonaddicted A549 cells and c-MET-addicted EBC1 cells
were treated with tivantinib or vincristine for 2 or 16 hours, and
the effect on microtubules in those cells was determined by
immunoﬂuorescent staining of a-tubulin. Tivantinib treatment led to a loss of microtubules in both A549 and EBC1,
similar to the vincristine-treated cells (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S8 and S9).
To explore whether tivantinib directly affects microtubule
formation in vitro, we conducted a tubulin polymerization
assay. Highly puriﬁed a- and b-tubulin and GTP were mixed
with tivantinib, vincristine, crizotinib or paclitaxel, and incubated. Compared with control, paclitaxel enhanced tubulin

polymerization, whereas vincristine inhibited tubulin polymerization completely as has been well described previously
(Fig. 5B; refs. 31, 33). Similar to vincristine, tivantinib inhibited
tubulin polymerization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B
and Supplementary Fig. S10). In contrast, c-MET inhibitors
crizotinib and PHA-665752 did not affect tubulin polymerization (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that tivantinib disrupts
microtubules in cells by abrogating microtubule assembly.

Discussion
The HGF/c-MET pathway is required for the normal development in mammals (34). However, evidence to date suggests
that the activity of this pathway is normally low in adults
except for some speciﬁc physiologic responses including
embryogenesis and wound healing (35, 36). However, the
HGF/c-MET pathway is frequently dysregulated in many
types of human cancers, and the c-MET expression is correlated with the patient poor prognosis (35, 37). c-MET transmits
signals for cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis. In addition, activation of c-MET can lead to resistance
to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and the HGF/c-MET pathway is believed to be an attractive target for EGFR-resistant
cancer therapy.

Katayama et al.

Tivantinib (ARQ 197) was originally reported as a selective,
orally administrated, small-molecule, non-ATP competitive
inhibitor of c-MET (12). The sensitivity to tivantinib was
reported to be dependent on the c-MET status (12). Tivantinib
is now entered into clinical trials (13–18) and has shown
preliminary activity in combination with erlotinib in KRASmutant NSCLCs (16, 38).
We compared the tivantinib sensitivity between c-MET–
addicted and c-MET–independent cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). To our surprise, we found that the IC50 values
of tivantinib in c-MET–independent A549, H460, and HCC827
were similar to those in c-MET–addicted EBC1, MKN45, and
SNU638 cells (Fig. 1), suggesting that the toxicity of this
compound is unrelated to inhibition of c-MET. In addition,
our previously established c-MET inhibitor PHA-665752–resistant SNU638 clones were c-MET–independent and were as
sensitive to tivantinib as that in parental SNU638 cells (Fig. 2).
Furthermore, tivantinib did not downregulate phospho-c-MET
levels after 6 hours treatment (Fig. 3A). When cells were treated
with doses of tivantinib exceeding the cytotoxic doses for 24
hours, a modest decrease in phospho-c-MET levels was
observed in EBC1 and MKN45 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
However, this did not lead to marked suppression of downstream PI3K/AKT and MAP–ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK pathways, suggesting that this is not the cause of its cytotoxicity. In
total, these experiments provide compelling evidence that the
cytotoxic activity of this compound is not due to its effects on
c-MET.
Tivantinib was reported to stabilize c-MET in inactive form
(12, 19). MKN45 cells have MET gene ampliﬁcation (7) and
constitutive c-MET activation. However, when MKN45 cells
were treated with 100 nmol/L of crizotinib, phospho-c-MET
levels were potently suppressed within 6 hours. Crizotinib
binds c-MET in the inactive conformation (39). Even though
c-MET was in the inactive conformation, tivantinib was
unable to block the reactivation of c-MET (Fig. 3B). In A549
cells, we did observe that tivantinib incubation mitigated
activation of c-MET by HGF (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus,
it remains possible that tivantinib has an effect on c-MET
activation by ligand. However, the data in this article show that
the indiscriminatory toxicity of this compound is not due to its
modest effects on c-MET signaling.
Although tivantinib was developed as a c-MET inhibitor and
exhibits potent antitumor activity, the data suggested that
tivantinib exhibits its antitumor activity by affecting unknown
targets in addition to c-MET. Indeed, this was underscored by
the effect of tivantinib on the cell cycle, that was quite distinct
from other c-MET inhibitors, crizotinib and PHA-665752 (Fig.
4A and Supplementary Fig. S6). To identify a potential target of
tivantinib, we used the COMPARE analysis using JFCR39 cell
line panel. The ﬁngerprint of tivantinib was most similar to
microtubule inhibitors. In contrast, the ﬁngerprints of crizotinib and PHA-665752 were not similar to tivantinib (Fig. 4B
and C). Furthermore, tivantinib treatment disrupted microtubules both in c-MET–addicted EBC1 and c-MET nonaddicted A549 cells (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Figs. S8 and
S9). These results indicate that tivantinib has an ability to
inhibit microtubule function.

Cancer Res; 73(10) May 15, 2013

Both microtubule polymerization and depolymerization
are required for mitosis and normal homeostasis of the cells
(40). The in vitro tubulin polymerization assay suggested that
tivantinib inhibits tubulin polymerization similar to vincristine
(Fig. 5B). Thus, our results suggest that growth inhibition/
cytotoxicity of tivantinib may be mainly due to inhibition of
tubulin polymerization. In the in vitro tubulin polymerization
experiments, we found that 3 mmol/L of tivantinib was
required to inhibit polymerization. In this assay, the concentration of puriﬁed tubulin is approximately 18 mmol/L
(2 mg/mL). Because the concentration of drug required to
inhibit tubulin polymerization is likely impacted by the concentration of tubulin, higher inhibitor concentration might
be required to inhibit tubulin polymerization in these assays.
However, it is important to note 10 mmol/L doses of c-MET
inhibitors, crizotinib and PHA-665752, do not inhibit tubulin
polymerization (Fig. 5A). Further studies are needed to
clarify how tivantinib inhibits tubulin polymerization. Because
the in vitro tubulin polymerization assay does not contain
microtubule associate proteins, we hypothesize that tivantinib directly binds tubulin.
Currently, many clinical trials are based on the fact that
tivantinib is a c-MET inhibitor. The phase II trial of erlotinib
with tivantinib or placebo did not reveal a signiﬁcant
difference between 2 groups. Although the study did not
meet its primary endpoint, subset analysis suggests that
tivantinib showed increased efﬁcacy among patients with
KRAS mutation (16). Because our study suggests that tivantinib exhibits antitumor effect via microtubule inhibition, it
remains possible that tivantinib may also be effective to
other solid cancers. Indeed, the combination with erlotinib
may not be the most active because this combination was
developed with the notion that tivantinib is a potent c-MET
inhibitor. As the mode of action of tivantinib seems to be
different from classical antimitotic drugs, further studies are
necessary to understand the detailed mechanism how tivantinib inhibits tubulin polymerization and how to use this
agent most effectively to treat cancer.
