Ability of NGR-TNF to Enhance Chemotherapeutic Efficacy

Abstract
NGR-TNF is a derivative of TNF-a that targets tumor blood vessels and enhances penetration of chemotherapeutic drugs. Because of this property, NGR-TNF is being tested in combination with chemotherapy in various
phase II and III clinical trials. Here we report that chromogranin A (CgA), a protein present in variable amounts
in the blood of normal subjects and cancer patients, inhibits the synergism of NGR-TNF with doxorubicin and
melphalan in mouse models of lymphoma and melanoma. Pathophysiologically relevant levels of circulating CgA
blocked NGR-TNF–induced drug penetration by enhancing endothelial barrier function and reducing drug
extravasation in tumors. Mechanistic investigations done in endothelial cell monolayers in vitro showed that
CgA inhibited phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, disassembly of VE-cadherin–dependent adherence junctions,
paracellular macromolecule transport, and NGR-TNF–induced drug permeability. In this system, the N-terminal
fragment of CgA known as vasostatin-1 also inhibited drug penetration and NGR-TNF synergism. Together, our
results suggest that increased levels of circulating CgA and its fragments, as it may occur in certain cancer
patients with nonneuroendocrine tumors, may reduce drug delivery to tumor cells particularly as induced
by NGR-TNF. Measuring CgA and its fragments may assist the selection of patients that can respond better to
NGR-TNF/chemotherapy combinations in clinical trials. Cancer Res; 71(17); 5881–90. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer patients is often
limited by inadequate and uneven diffusion of drugs in tumor
tissues (1). This phenomenon is related to abnormal vasculature and altered composition of tumor tissues, which may
cause irregular blood flow, heterogeneous permeability,
increased interstitial fluid pressure and, consequently, uneven
drug penetration in tumors (2, 3).
We have previously shown that a neovasculature-homing
TNF-a derivative, called NGR-TNF, can be exploited to improve
drug penetration in neoplastic tissues (3, 4). NGR-TNF is a
cytokine–peptide fusion protein, originally developed by our
group, consisting of TNF fused to the CNGRCG peptide (3). This
peptide is a ligand of a CD13 form overexpressed in the tumor
neovasculature (5–7). Experiments in mouse models have
shown that the administration of ultra-low doses of NGRTNF (picograms) increases the penetration of doxorubicin,
melphalan, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel into solid
tumors (4, 8). NGR-TNF can also induce, at later time points,

vascular damage and inflammatory/immune responses (4, 8).
Phase I and II clinical studies with low-dose NGR-TNF, alone
and in combination with chemotherapy, showed manageable toxicity profile and evidence of disease control, particularly in subpopulations of patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma and pleural mesothelioma (9–14). A randomized
double-blind phase III study of NGR-TNF (in combination
with chemotherapy or supportive care) started in 2010 in
patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (http://www.
clinicaltrialsfeeds.org/clinical-trials/show/NCT01098266). The
identification of factors that promote tumor resistance to
targeted-TNF/chemotherapy combination could be, therefore,
pharmacologically and clinically relevant.
We have previously shown that chromogranin A (CgA), a
protein released in circulation by many endocrine and neuroendocrine cells, neurons and granulocytes, is an important
modulator of the endothelial barrier function and a potent
inhibitor of TNF-induced vascular leakage in the liver (15, 16).
Structure–activity studies have shown that a bioactive site is
located in the N-terminal region of CgA (15, 17). A fragment of
CgA spanning the N-terminal residues 1–78, called vasostatin1 (VS-1), can inhibit a series of effects exerted by TNF on
endothelial cells, including phosphorylation of p38 MAP
kinase [p38-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)], redistribution of VE-cadherin, formation of gaps, paracellular
transport of macromolecules (15, 18). VS-1 can also inhibit
VEGF- and thrombin-induced endothelial cell permeability
(19). Thus, CgA and its N-terminal fragment VS-1 are efficient
inhibitors of endothelial cell activation and permeability
caused by TNF and by other stimuli.

Increased levels of circulating CgA have been detected in
patients with neuroendocrine tumors, in subpopulations of
patients with prostate, breast or non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), and in patients with heart failure, renal failure,
hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, hepatocellular
carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, pancreatitis,
inflammatory bowel disease, or atrophic gastritis (20–31).
Furthermore, increased levels of CgA have been detected also
in patients treated with proton pump inhibitors, a class of drugs
commonly used to treat acid peptic disorders (32, 33). Thus,
CgA levels higher than normal values can occur not only in
patients with neuroendocrine tumors or with tumors that may
undergo neuroendocrine differentiation but also in patients
with nonneuroendocrine tumors for a variety of reasons (30).
Given these premises and considering the protective effects
of CgA on TNF-induced alteration of the endothelial barrier
function, we have hypothesized that abnormal levels of circulating CgA might inhibit the synergism between NGR-TNF
and chemotherapy. To address this hypothesis, we have
investigated the effect of CgA and VS-1 on the antitumor
activity of NGR-TNF/chemotherapy against murine lymphoma and melanoma, that is, 2 models of nonneuroendocrine tumors. The rationale for this choice relies on the fact
that these models have been largely exploited for preclinical
studies on NGR-TNF combined with various chemotherapeutic drugs and that this drug combination is currently investigated in patients with nonneuroendocrine tumors (3, 4, 8).
We show that both proteins, at levels similar to those found in
patients, can markedly reduce the response of tumors to NGRTNF combined with melphalan or with doxorubicin, by reducing the transport and the penetration of these drugs into
neoplastic tissues.

Materials and Methods
Drugs and reagents
Melphalan (Alkeran) was obtained from Glaxo-Wellcome;
doxorubicin (Adriblastina) was purchased from PharmaciaUpjohn. Murine NGR-TNF (consisting of TNF fused with the
C-terminus of CNGRCG) were prepared by recombinant DNA
technology and purified from E. coli cell extracts as described
(3).
VS-1, CgA, and anti-CgA antibodies
Ser-Thr-Ala-CgA1–78 (VS-1), human CgA (hCgA), and murine CgA (mCgA) were prepared by recombinant DNA technology and expression in E. coli cells as described (34).
Anti-human CgA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5A8 (epitope
CgA53-57), B4E11 (epitope CgA68-71, all IgG1k) were produced and characterized as described previously (35, 36).
In vivo studies
Studies on animal models were approved by the Ethical
Committee of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute and done
according to the prescribed guidelines. C57BL/6 mice (Charles
River Laboratories), weighing 16 to 18 g, were challenged with
subcutaneous injection in the left flank of 1  105 RMA or
B16-F1 living cells. Six to 10 days later, mice were treated with

5882

Cancer Res; 71(17) September 1, 2011

VS-1 (3 mg) or CgA (0.2 mg or 1 mg) 60, 30, and 0 minutes before
administration of NGR-TNF (0.1 ng). Two hours later, mice
were given melphalan or doxorubicin solutions (90 or 80 mg,
respectively). All drugs were administered intraperitoneally
(i.p.), diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride, containing 100 mg/mL
endotoxin-free HSA (Farma-Biagini SpA), except for doxorubicin and melphalan, which were diluted in 0.9% sodium
chloride alone. Tumor growth was monitored daily by measuring the tumors with callipers as previously described (4).
Animals were killed before the tumors reached 1.0 to 1.5 cm
in diameter.
In vitro endothelial permeability assay
The endothelial permeability assay was done using a transwell system (6.5-mm insert, 0.4-mm pore size filters; Corning),
essentially as previously described, using 40 kDa fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran conjugate (1 mg/mL; Sigma),
as a tracer. The FITC–dextran conjugate present in the lower
chamber of the transwell system at various time points was
analyzed using a fluorimeter (excitation, 495 nm; emission,
520 nm). The same assays were done using doxorubicin
(200 mg/mL) in place of FITC–dextran (excitation, 471 nm;
emission, 556 nm).

Results
CgA and VS-1 inhibit the synergistic activity of NGR-TNF
and chemotherapy in tumor-bearing mice
To investigate the effect of CgA and VS-1 on the synergism
between NGR-TNF and chemotherapeutic drugs, we treated
RMA lymphoma–bearing mice with CgA or VS-1 (1 or 3 mg,
respectively, 3 times in 1 hour), then with NGR-TNF (0.1 ng),
and finally with doxorubicin (80 mg, 2 hours after NGR-TNF;
Fig. 1A). The combination of doxorubicin with NGR-TNF, but
not doxorubicin alone, delayed tumor growth, as previously
shown (4). This effect was completely inhibited by CgA or VS-1
(Fig. 1B). We obtained similar results using a model based on
B16-F1 melanoma–bearing mice and melphalan. Also in this
case, both CgA and VS-1 inhibited the antitumor effect exerted
by NGR-TNF in combination with melphalan (Fig. 1C). These
results suggest that CgA can inhibit the synergism between
NGR-TNF and chemotherapy and that its N-terminal domain
contains a bioactive site.
Notably, CgA and VS-1 reached concentrations of about
5 nmol/L after 1 to 2 hours, that is, at the time at which
NGR-TNF is expected to exert its action (Fig. 1D). Notably,
these levels of CgA are in the range of those observed in certain
cancer patients with nonneuroendocrine tumors (31, 37).
CgA and VS-1 do not inhibit the cytotoxic activity of
doxorubicin and melphalan alone and in combination
with NGR-TNF
The mechanism of action of CgA and VS-1 was then
investigated. Neither CgA nor VS-1 affected the cytotoxic
activity of doxorubicin and melphalan, alone and in combination with NGR-TNF, against human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC) and RMA cells (Fig. 2). These results
suggest that the inhibition of the antitumor activity of

alone or in combination. Viable
cells were stained with MTT. C and
D, the same procedure was
applied for RMA cell cytotoxicity
assays (mean  SE of 2 assays,
each conducted in quadruplicate).

NGR-TNF/chemotherapy by CgA or VS-1 was not related to
inhibition of their cytotoxic activity against endothelial or
tumor cells. More likely, it was related to a decreased drug
delivery to tumor cells.
CgA and VS-1 inhibit the penetration of doxorubicin
in RMA tumors induced by NGR-TNF
To investigate whether CgA and VS-1 could affect the
delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumor cells in vivo,
we exploited the fact that doxorubicin is a fluorescent compound and that tumor cell fluorescence is an indication of the
amount of doxorubicin that penetrate tumor cells (4). Tumorbearing mice were treated with doxorubicin and, 2 hours later,
tumor were excised, disaggregated, and analysed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Preadministration of NGRTNF to mice (2 hours before doxorubicin) increased the tumor
cell fluorescence (i.e., the penetration of doxorubicin in tumor
cells), as observed previously (4). However, pretreatment with
CgA and VS-1 completely inhibited this effect (Fig. 3A). Notably,
VS-1 significantly reduced also the spontaneous penetration of
doxorubicin in tumor cells (Fig. 3A). These results support the

hypothesis that CgA and VS-1 can inhibit the delivery of
doxorubicin to RMA cells in vivo.
Induction of endogenous CgA with omeprazole
inhibits the penetration of doxorubicin in RMA
tumors induced by NGR-TNF
To assess the role of endogenous CgA, we investigated the
effect of omeprazole, a drug known to induce the release of
CgA in circulation in patients, on doxorubicin penetration in
RMA tumors. Preliminary experiments showed that a single
administration of omeprazole to mice (1 mg, i.v.) can increase
the circulating levels of murine CgA from 0.9  0.08 to
1.48 nmol/L  0.079 (n ¼ 5, mean  SE) by ELISA, peaking
2 hours after injection (Fig. 3B, left). Furthermore, repeated
injection of omeprazole (1 mg/day, for 5 days) induced an
increase in circulating murine CgA, reaching levels of
1.75 nmol/L at day 4. The CgA returned to normal values 4 days
after discontinuation of omeprazole administration. Repeated
administration of omeprazole significantly decreased the
penetration of doxorubicin induced by NGR-TNF in RMA
tumors (Fig. 3B, right). No significant effects were observed

CgA and VS-1 do not affect RMA cell membrane

The observation that CgA and VS-1 can reduce the delivery

investigate whether these polypeptides could affect the transport of drugs through RMA cell membranes. To this aim, we

Figure 4. CgA and VS-1 do not affect the penetration of doxorubicin in RMA tumor cells in vitro. RMA cells were incubated with different amounts of
CgA, VS-1, or NGR-TNF in complete medium for 1 hour and then with various amounts of doxorubicin (1 hour). Fluorescence intensity of cells (as measured
by FACS) is shown (mean  SE, cumulative results of 3 independent experiments, each conducted in duplicate).

preincubated RMA cells in vitro with different amounts of
NGR-TNF, CgA, or VS-1 (1 hour) and then with different
amounts of doxorubicin (1 hour). Finally, we analyzed the
fluorescence intensity of cells by FACS. As expected, increasing concentrations of doxorubicin increased the fluorescence
intensity of cells, indicating that doxorubicin could penetrate
the cells in a dose-dependent manner under these conditions
(Fig. 4, left panel). Neither NGR-TNF nor CgA/VS-1 could
affect the fluorescence intensity of doxorubicin-treated cells
(Fig. 4, right panels). These results argue against the hypothesis that these polypeptides can affect the transport of doxorubicin through cell membranes.

NGR-TNF could increase the flux of FITC–dextran from
the upper to the lower chamber of the transwell system.
CgA (4–20 nmol/L) efficiently inhibited this effect (Fig. 6A,
top panel). This result supports the concept that this protein
can inhibit the paracellular transport of molecules induced by
NGR-TNF through endothelial cells.

CgA inhibits the NGR-TNFinduced transport of
molecules from the vascular compartment to the
tumor cell microenvironment
We then investigated whether CgA could inhibit the NGRTNFinduced transport of drugs from blood to the tumor
microenvironment. To this aim, we treated RMA-bearing mice
with CgA, alone or in combination with NGR-TNF, followed 2
hours later by Patent Blue VF, a hydrophilic nontoxic dye that
does not penetrate into cells and that can be easily quantified.
After 5 minutes, the mice were killed and perfused with a
saline solution. The amount of Patent Blue VF present in
tumor tissue homogenates was then quantified spectrophotometrically. CgA inhibited the NGR-TNF–induced penetration of Patent Blue VF in tumor tissues (Fig. 5). These results
support the hypothesis that CgA can indeed affect the transport of molecules from the vascular compartment to the
tumor cell microenvironment induced by NGR-TNF.
CgA and VS-1 inhibit NGR-TNFinduced endothelial
barrier alteration
The positive effect of TNF on endothelial permeability and
vascular leakage is a well-known phenomenon (38). This effect
can be efficiently inhibited by CgA and VS-1 (15). Keeping this
in mind, we tested the hypothesis that NGR-TNF can promote
drug extravasation by affecting the endothelial permeability
and that CgA and VS-1 can inhibit this effect by protecting the
endothelial barrier integrity. To this aim we analyzed, first, the
effect of NGR-TNF on the paracellular transport of FITC–
dextran (a macromolecular tracer) through endothelial
cell monolayers cultured in transwell systems. As expected,

perfused. Tumors were excised, homogenized, and centrifuged. The
supernatants were mixed with trichloroacetic acid [10% (v/v), final
concentration] and cleared by centrifugation. The absorbance at 405 nm
was then measured using a spectrophotometer (n ¼ 4 mice per group,

monolayers in vitro. A, effect of NGR-TNF and CgA on the flux of FITC–dextran (40 kDa) and doxorubicin through endothelial cell monolayers (HUVEC).

B, effect of CgA (2.5 mg/mL) on VE–cadherin delocalization and gap formation (arrows) induced by NGR-TNF (5 ng/mL) in confluent endothelial cells.
VE–cadherin was detected by immunofluorescence analysis with a rabbit anti–VE-cadherin antibody and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 conjugate (red).
Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue; representative picture of 2 experiments each conducted in duplicate). Bar, 10 mm. C, effect of CgA on NGR-TNFinduced
phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were incubated with NGR-TNF and CgA and analyzed by Western blot with antip38MAPK and antiphosphorylated p38-MAPK antibodies after 0, 5, and 20 minutes (representative results of 3 experiments).

To assess weather CgA and VS-1 could also inhibit the
transport of drugs induced by NGR-TNF, we carried out a
similar experiment using doxorubicin in place of FITCdextran. Both CgA and VS-1 could inhibit the flux of doxorubicin from the upper chamber to the lower chamber induced
by NGR-TNF (Fig. 6A, bottom panels). These data support the
hypothesis that these polypeptides can affect drug delivery to
tumor cells in vivo by inhibiting the alteration of the endothelial barrier function induced by NGR-TNF.
CgA inhibits the NGR-TNFinduced disassembly
of VE-cadherin–dependent adherence junctions
The molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect
exerted by CgA on the NGR-TNFinduced permeability was
then investigated. First, we analyzed whether NGR-TNF could
induce the disassembly of VE-cadherin, a protein critical for
adherence junctions, in confluent HUVEC cells. Immunofluorescence staining of VE-cadherin showed a homogeneous distribution of this molecule at cell–cell contacts (Fig. 6B).
Incubation with NGR-TNF induced the disassembly of VE-cadherin and caused the formation of intercellular gaps. This effect
was inhibited by CgA (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that CgA can

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibit the permeabilizing activity of NGR-TNF by preventing
VE-cadherin–dependent adherence junction disassembly.
CgA inhibits the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK
induced by NGR-TNF in endothelial cells
TNF is known to induce the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK,
a signaling mechanism that can alter VE-cadherin expression
and endothelial permeability (39). To assess whether NGRTNF and CgA regulate this signaling pathway in a positive and
negative manner, respectively, we analysed the effect of these
proteins on p38-MAPK phosphorylation in HUVEC cells at
different time points. Western blot analysis of total and
phosphorylated p38-MAPK showed that NGR-TNF can induce
the phosphorylation of this enzyme in a time-dependent
manner and that CgA can inhibit this effect in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 6C). CgA alone did not affect
p38-MAPK phosphorylation (data not shown).

Discussion
The results of this study show that pretreatment of mice
bearing RMA lymphomas or B16-F1 melanomas with doses of

CgA that enhance its circulating levels 4 to 5 times above the
normal values completely inhibits the synergism of NGR-TNF
with doxorubicin and melphalan. This inhibitory activity is
unlikely related to inhibition of the cytotoxic activity of this
drug combinations, as no effect was observed in cytotoxicity
assays with cultured endothelial or tumor cells. More likely,
the inhibitory activity of CgA was related to a reduction of the
delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumor cells. This
hypothesis is supported by the results of FACS analysis of
tumor cells recovered from tumor-bearing mice treated with
doxorubicin (which is a fluorescent compound) showing that
the penetration of drugs into neoplastic cells induced by NGRTNF in vivo can be almost completely inhibited by CgA.
How does NGR-TNF and CgA increase and decrease, respectively, the penetration of drugs into tumor cells? Drug delivery
to neoplastic cells in solid tumors requires, in principle, at
least 4 steps: the drug must (a) enter the tumor blood vessels
(step 1), (b) cross the endothelial barrier (step 2), (c) migrate
through the tumor interstitium (step 3), and (d) cross the
membrane of the target cells (step 4; see Fig. 7 for a schematic
representation). The results obtained with cultured cells show
that neither NGR-TNF nor CgA can affect the penetration of
doxorubicin into RMA cells, arguing against a crucial role of
these molecules on step 4. The effect on other steps are likely
more important. Interestingly, the results of in vivo assays
done with RMA tumor–bearing mice injected with Patent Blue
VF (a hydrophilic dye that does not cross the cell membrane)
show that NGR-TNF can increase the accumulation of dye in
the tumor microenvironment and that CgA can inhibit this
effect. Because tumors were perfused before excision (to
remove the dye present in the intravascular compartment),
these findings suggest that the dye was located in the extra-

and CgA on the penetration of drugs in tumors. To reach cancer cells
drugs must (1) enter tumor vasculature, (2) cross the vessel wall,
(3) diffuse through the interstitium, and (4) penetrate into the cancer cells.
NGR-TNF exerts synergistic effects with chemotherapy by altering the
endothelial barrier function and promoting drug penetration in tumors
(step 2). CgA and VS-1 inhibit NGR-TNF/chemotherapy synergism by
protecting the endothelial barrier integrity.

vascular compartment of the tumor microenvironment. Thus,
NGR-TNF enhances the drug extravasation steps (steps 2 and
3), whereas CgA can inhibit this effect. Accordingly, the results
of endothelial permeability assays showed that CgA can
inhibit the NGR-TNFinduced flux of FITC-dextran through
endothelial cell monolayers. Given that FITC-dextran is a good
tracer for the paracellular transport of soluble compounds
through the endothelial barrier, these findings suggest that
NGR-TNF can reduce the barrier function of endothelial cells
whereas CgA inhibits this effect (step 2). Notably, CgA could
also inhibit the NGR-TNFenhanced flux of doxorubicin
through endothelial cell monolayers. Thus, whereas the alteration of the endothelial barrier function by NGR-TNF might
account for the improved delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs
to tumor cells, the protective activity exerted by CgA on the
endothelial barrier integrity might account for the inhibition
of drug penetration and therapeutic activity observed in vivo.
Notably, all the in vitro and in vivo effects observed with CgA
were observed also with its N-terminal fragment (VS-1). This
observation suggests that the biologically active site of CgA is
located in its N-terminal domain. A schematic representation
of these concepts is shown in Figure 7.
How do NGR-TNF, CgA, and VS-1 affect endothelial cell
permeability? The results of in vitro studies show that NGRTNF, similar to TNF, can alter the barrier function of
endothelial cell monolayers by causing a redistribution of
VE-cadherin, a component of adherence junctions critical
for the maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity (40) and
that both CgA and VS-1 can inhibit this effect. The changes
of VE-cadherin expression induced by TNF involve
p38-MAPK phosphorylation (39). We observed that also
NGR-TNF, similar to TNF, can induce p38-MAPK phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Again, CgA could inhibit this
effect. Notably, CgA did not inhibit the cytotoxic activity of
NGR-TNF in assays done in the presence of actinomycin D, a
transcription inhibitor (data not shown). This observation
suggests that CgA does not inhibit the interaction of
NGR-TNF with TNF membrane receptors. More likely,
CgA inhibits the NGR-TNF–induced phosphorylation of
p38-MAPK by interfering with downstream signaling pathways triggered by TNF receptor activation.
Are the doses of CgA used in our experimental models
physiologically relevant? Administration of 1 mg of CgA, i.p.,
generated circulating levels of about 3 to 5 nmol/L at the time
of NGR-TNF administration in our murine models. This dose
was selected to achieve circulating levels similar to those
observed in subpopulation of patients with nonneuroendocrine tumors (11, 12, 31, 37). For example, although serum CgA
in the blood of normal subjects is about 1 nmol/L (21),
increased levels of CgA, up to 4 to 8 nmol/L have been
detected in the sera of a subgroup of patients with NSCLC,
despite the lack of neuroendocrine differentiation, with
important prognostic implication (37). Considering that the
combination of NGR-TNF and chemotherapy is currently
under investigation in patients with NSCLC, hepatocellular
carcinoma, or other nonneuroendocrine tumors (9–14), the
results showing inhibitory activity of CgA in animal models of
nonneuroendocrine tumors might be clinically relevant.

Chromogranin A and NGR-TNF/Chemotherapy

A growing body of evidence suggest that administration of
proton pump inhibitors, which are drugs commonly used in
the treatment of acid peptic disorders, can enhance 2 to 3
times, and in certain patients even up to 10 times, the
circulating levels of CgA, depending on the time of administration (32, 33). These drugs, by decreasing gastric acidity,
induce the release of gastrin that, in turn, can induce enterochromaffin cell-like cell hyperplasia and CgA secretion (41,
42). Accordingly, we found that daily treatment of mice with
omeprazole can increase 2-fold the circulating levels of CgA
and that 4 day discontinuation of therapy is necessary to
return to base line. Interestingly, we observed that administration of omeprazole to mice can inhibit the penetration of
doxorubicin in tumors and that this effect can be inhibited by
administration of a CgA-neutralizing antibody. Thus, a 2-fold
enhancement of CgA levels was sufficient to inhibit the
penetration of doxorubicin induced by NGR-TNF in tumors.
Considering the wide use of proton pump inhibitors in
patients, also these findings may have important clinical
implications.
This study has a limitation that must be highlighted:
although our models are suitable to investigate the role of
circulating CgA in nonneuroendocrine tumors, they are
not necessarily suitable to address the role of tumor
derived/locally produced CgA that may occur in patients with
neuroendocrine tumors. Indeed, in the latter case the tumor
vasculature is exposed to much higher levels of CgA (possibly
>1 mmol/L) compared with those of nonneuroendocrine
tumors, owing to the fact that the source of CgA is the tumor
itself. Because the dose–response curves of CgA and VS-1 in
various biological assays are "bell shaped" with loss of activity
at micromolar concentrations (36, 43, 44), higher levels of CgA
in the tumor microenvironment could be, paradoxically, less
active than low levels of circulating CgA. Furthermore, different proteolytic processing may occur to CgA released by
neuroendocrine tumor cells and by normal cells (45). Thus,
further studies with suitable neuroendocrine tumor models
are necessary to address this point.
Although many studies showed that CgA is a good marker
for diagnosis and prognosis of neuroendocrine tumors, even
for monitoring their responses to chemotherapy (29, 30, 46),
only few works have investigated the capability of baseline

circulating CgA to predict the therapeutic response. Interestingly, in 3 studies carried out on SCLC, NSCLC, and prostate
cancer, the response rates to chemotherapy inversely correlated with baseline CgA (37, 47, 48). However, another study on
prostate cancer, a tumor that may undergo neuroendocrine
differentiation, showed higher response rates in patients
with high baseline CgA (49). Moreover, in a recent study, a
large proportion of patients with metastatic pancreatic endocrine carcinomas experienced a major biochemical response
despite an elevated serum CgA before therapy (50). These
conflicting results further underline the need of new studies to
elucidate the role of CgA in the response to chemotherapy of
neuroendocrine tumors or of tumors that may undergo neuroendocrine differentiation.
In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that CgA can
inhibit the NGR-TNF/chemotherapy synergism in murine
models of nonneuroendocrine tumors by inhibiting
NGR-TNF–induced changes of vascular permeability and drug
penetration in neoplastic tissues. These results could stimulate further work aimed at assessing whether circulating CgA
and VS-1 levels can predict the response to NGR-TNF/
chemotherapy in patients. Furthermore, the finding that
omeprazole-induced CgA can inhibit the penetration of doxorubicin in tumor tissues may suggest that discontinuation of
administration of proton pump inhibitors to patients and/or
its replacement with H2 receptor antagonists (a class of drugs
that do not increase CgA levels; ref. 33) might increase the
response rate to this therapy in patients with documented
elevation of circulating CgA or VS-1.
