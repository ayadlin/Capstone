Targeting Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatases in Breast Cancer
Nicola Aceto and Mohamed Bentires-Alj:
Most signaling pathways are modulated by
reversible tyrosine phosphorylation, which is regulated by
the opposing actions of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)
and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) [1]. Abnormal
tyrosine phosphorylation underlies various diseases
of deregulated growth and differentiation, including
cancer [1]. Although the involvement of several PTKs
in malignancy has been studied extensively (e.g., ErbB2/
HER2 in breast cancer), elucidation of the participation
of specific PTPs in this disease has only started recently.
Here, we summarize the activities of two major PTPs,
SHP2 [2] and PTP1B [3], in breast cancer, highlight
their potential as targets for breast cancer treatment or
prevention, and discuss the technical challenges facing the
development of specific PTP inhibitors.
The tyrosine-phosphatase SHP2 has been shown to
play a broad role in development and cancer, as well as in
the regulation of cell fate and the activation of a number
of signaling networks downstream of receptor tyrosinekinases and cytokine receptors [4]. However, its merits as
a drug target for breast cancer and its role in breast tumor
progression have not been demonstrated previously. We
have discovered a fundamental contribution of SHP2 to
breast cancer progression and the propagation of tumorinitiating cells (TICs) in vivo [2]. Mechanistically, SHP2
activates transcription factors such as c-Myc and ZEB1
and induces the expression of a set of “SHP2 signature”
genes found co-activated in a subset of human primary
breast tumors and associated with invasive behavior
and poor prognosis. SHP2, acting via c-Myc, induces
the expression of the suppressor of miRNA biogenesis
LIN28B which blocks the maturation of the tumorsuppressor microRNA let-7 [2]. These results provide
new insights into signaling networks promoting tumor
progression and TIC maintenance, as well as a rationale
for developing SHP2-targeting agents for breast cancer
therapy. In addition, the identification of a set of “SHP2
signature” genes, activated in the presence of SHP2
signaling, could provide a powerful tool to identify tumors
eligible for SHP2-targeted therapy.
A further major PTP family member, PTP1B, is a
well-established metabolic regulator that is associated with
cancer [5]. For example, PTP1B knockout mice are insulin
and leptin hypersensitive, which contributes to obesityresistance under high-fat diet conditions [6, 7]. Moreover,
whole-body deletion of PTP1B in mice delays or protects
against HER2/Neu-induced mammary carcinogenesis [8,
9]. Recently, we found that deletion of PTP1B specifically
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in the mammary epithelium also delays the onset of HER2/
Neu-evoked breast tumors, suggesting a cell-autonomous
role for PTP1B in the onset of this disease [3]. However,
deletion of PTP1B in established mouse mammary tumors
or shRNA-mediated depletion of PTP1B in human breast
cancer cell lines grown as xenografts did not affect tumor
growth [3]. These results indicate that targeting PTP1B
may be effective in breast cancer prevention but not in the
treatment of advanced breast cancers of the HER2-positive
subtype.
The latest findings on SHP2 and PTP1B clearly
indicate that many patients would benefit from the
design of specific inhibitors targeting these phosphatases.
Unfortunately, the development of PTP inhibitors has
encountered significant technical challenges. For example,
interaction of inhibitor compounds with the PTP domain
requires a high polarity, which is associated unfortunately
with reduced cell permeability and bioavailability. To
some extent, this problem can be addressed by the use
of prodrugs or other chemical modifications. In addition,
PTPs are highly susceptible to oxidation of the catalytic
cysteine residue in the phosphatase domain, which leads
to a conformational change at the active site and may limit
binding efficacy. Taking advantage of this property, recent
studies suggest that therapeutics that stabilize the oxidized
form of the phosphatase and lock it in an inactive state
may represent an alternative way for inhibiting PTPs [10].
Another important issue is the need to develop selective
compounds that do not bind structurally similar PTPs,
such as SHP1 (in the case of SHP2) or TC-PTP (in the
case of PTP1B). This is a challenging aspect since PTPs
share highly conserved phosphatase domains. However,
specific PTP subpockets surrounding the active site can
be targeted to enhance selectivity. Lastly, although these
technical challenges may be overcome, there remains the
challenge of identifying specific PTP substrates that can be
used as biomarkers of the response to the inhibitor.
In conclusion, we are starting to uncover important
activities of PTPs in breast cancer initiation, progression
and maintenance. Studies of SHP2 and PTP1B have
exposed them as potentially important targets for the
treatment or prevention of breast cancer, not to mention
the importance of PTP1B in diabetes. However, the
appropriateness of specific inhibitors has to be fully
confirmed, especially given the differential involvement
of PTPs in an organ-dependent fashion. Crucial issues for
future studies include the participation of other PTPs in
tissue development and maintenance as well as cancer, and

approach may lead to the discovery of novel signaling
mechanisms regulated by PTPs and a better understanding
of cancer-associated pathways.
