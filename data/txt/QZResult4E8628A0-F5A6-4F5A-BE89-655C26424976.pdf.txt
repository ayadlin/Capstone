BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated the incidence of pathologic downstaging and complete remission (CR) in
patients with high-grade ureteral and renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) (upper tract TCC) who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. METHODS: The study group comprised patients with biopsy-demonstrated, high-grade disease who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by nephrouterectomy from 2004 to
2008, during which time patients uniformly were considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The control group comprised patients with biopsy-demonstrated, high-grade disease who underwent initial nephroureterectomy from 1993
to 2004, when patients uniformly underwent initial surgery. Multiple clinical and pathologic features were evaluated,
and the primary endpoint was pathologic tumor classification. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients in the control
group underwent initial surgery, and 43 patients in the study group received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Baseline
demographics were similar between the groups except for a higher rate of sessile tumor architecture in the study
group (72.1% vs 49.5%; P ¼.018). There was significant downstaging in study group patients compared with the historic control group (P ¼.004). The incidence of tumors classified as pathologic T2 (pT2) or as pT3 or higher was significantly lower in the study group (pT2, 65.4% vs 48.8%; P ¼.043; pT3 or higher, 47.7% vs 27.9%; P ¼.029). Fourteen
percent of patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a pathologic CR. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy was associated with a 14% CR rate and a significant rate of downstaging. While longer follow-up is
awaited for survival data to mature, the current data provide justification for the sustained support of trials using this

Survival rates for patients with high-grade and high-stage upper tract transitional cell carcinoma (UTCC) are poor;
patients with locally advanced disease experience a 50% or greater risk of progression and less than a 2-year median survival duration.1-4 Contemporary analyses indicate that there has been no improvement in survival rates in the past several
decades for patients with high-grade and high-stage disease.1 Some have advocated a paradigm shift in the treatment of
such high-risk patients toward multimodality management that adds neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the traditional surgical
consolidation; however, there are minimal data, randomized or otherwise, supporting this more aggressive approach.1,5
Any interim data that demonstrate significant pathologic downstaging and complete remission (CR) rates (as evidenced
by pathologic T0 [pT0] disease) could provide surrogate data to justify the continuation of current trials that incorporate
the neoadjuvant approach. With this objective in mind, we evaluated the possibility of pathologic downstaging in patients
with high-risk UTCC who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical consolidation by comparing their

pathologic outcomes with those of a historic control
group who had similar clinical high-risk features but
underwent initial surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We performed a retrospective review of patients who
underwent nephrouterectomy at The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 2004 to 2008.
Patients with biopsy-demonstrated, high-grade disease
who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were selected as
the study group. During this period, patients uniformly
were considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed
by surgery if high-risk features were present. High-risk
features primarily entail the finding of high-grade disease
on biopsy, sessile architecture, and a large tumor burden
(defined subjectively as being observed on computed tomography). The control population was obtained from a
database of patients who were characterized previously;
those with biopsy-demonstrated, high-grade disease who
underwent initial nephroureterectomy during 1993 to
2004 were selected.1 During this previous era, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was considered infrequently (<9% of
patients); it was given in extreme circumstances, such as
patients who had overt evidence of clinical T4 disease or
grossly involved lymph nodes.1 Thus, most patients uniformly had undergone initial nephroureterectomy. The
following clinical and pathologic features were evaluated:
patient age, sex, laterality, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status, prior history of bladder cancer, location of tumor, tumor architecture, type of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiographic tumor size, surgical
technique, pathologic classification, pathologic lymph
node classification, number of lymph nodes removed, and
the presence of extranodal extension, lymphovascular
invasion, carcinoma in situ (CIS), and multifocality. A
pathologic CR was defined as the absence of any malignant elements in the resected surgical specimen. This
study was approved by the institutional review board.
Initial statistical power calculations were made on
the basis of previous data indicating an approximate 66%
probability that disease will be classified as pT2 or higher
when high-grade disease is encountered on biopsy.6,7 We
hypothesized that the incidence of disease classified as
pT2 or higher would be reduced in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. By using a 2-sided Fisher exact test
with a significance level of .05, to have 80% power to
detect a difference, a reduction of high-stage disease from
67% to 40% would require 44 patients, a reduction to

3128

35% would require 28 patients, and a reduction to 33%
would require 24 patients. The Fisher exact test and the
chi-square test were used to evaluate the association
between clinical and pathologic variables. Differences in
variables that had a continuous distribution across dichotomous or ranked categories were assessed using the
Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance, respectively. All reported P values
are 2-sided, and significance was set at P  .05. All statistical tests were performed with SPSS software (version
13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Among patients with biopsy-demonstrated, high-grade
disease, 107 patients in the historic control group underwent initial surgery, and 43 patients in the contemporary
study group received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before
they underwent surgery. The association of clinical and
pathologic variables between the 2 groups is shown in
Table 1. Baseline demographics were similar between the
groups, except that patients in the study group underwent
laparoscopic excision more frequently, reflecting current
trends in the surgical management of this disease. With
regard to tumor features, there was a higher incidence of
sessile architecture in the study group (72.1% vs 49.5%;
P ¼ .018), reflecting enrichment of patients with highrisk features.
The distribution of pathologic stage is represented
in Figure 1. There was a significant reduction of pathologic stage in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who underwent initial
surgery (P ¼ .004). The overall incidence of patients who
had pT2 or higher disease was reduced significantly in the
study group (46.5% vs 65.4%; P ¼ .043). When grouping
was based on pT3 or higher disease, the reduction was
greater, and the association was stronger (27.9% vs
47.7%; P ¼ .029). In addition, 14% of patients who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a CR, whereas
no patient in the control group did.
Patients in the study group were more likely to have
undergone lymphadenectomy and to have more lymph
nodes removed than patients in the historic control group
(median number of lymph nodes removed, 12 vs 5; P <
.001), again reflecting current trends in the surgical management of this disease and paralleling the management of
bladder cancer, in which greater import is given to lymphadenectomy and improving lymph node harvest in the
current era.8-12 There also was a trend toward lower rates

of extranodal extension in the study group. Although no
statistical difference was observed in the rate of lymph
node-positive disease between the 2 groups, we presume
that the number of events was low and that the analysis
potentially was underpowered to demonstrate any difference. Dramatic responses were observed in individual
patients (Figs. 2, 3).
The types of neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens
given, the median number of cycles, and tumor radiographic responses are summarized in Table 2. Nearly half
of the 43 patients received dose-dense, combined methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin13 chemotherapy for a median of 4 cycles, resulting in a median
50% decrease in radiographic tumor size. Seventy-seven
percent of patients received either a cisplatin or high-dose
ifosfamide combination preoperatively.14,15

DISCUSSION
We observed a significant reduction in pathologic classification for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including a 25.4% reduction in the incidence of pT2
or higher disease and a 41.5% reduction in the incidence
of pT3 or higher disease. This reduction occurred despite
the presence of higher risk factors in the study group (ie,
sessile tumors) that predicted a worse pathologic stage. In
addition, we observed a CR rate of 14% in patients who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To our knowledge,
this study represents the largest reported group of patients
with UTCC who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Igawa et al5 reported their experience with 15 patients
with locally advanced UTCC who received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and demonstrated a 13% CR rate and a

3130

53% overall response rate. The patients in that study who
had responses had a significant improvement in survival
duration. Although the validity of downstaging has not
been confirmed in upper tract urothelial tumors, it has
been considered a valid surrogate that correlates with outcomes in urothelial tumors of the bladder, and it seems
reasonable to extend it to this population.15-17 Moreover,
pathologic confirmation of CR is more meaningful than
radiographic evaluation because of the limitations of
imaging with this disease, as discussed further below.
The motivation to pursue neoadjuvant, as opposed
to adjuvant, chemotherapy for patients with high-risk
UTCC is based on several important observations. First,
data from the treatment of high-risk bladder cancer indicate improved survival in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.16,18 Second, most patients with highrisk UTCC suffer from underlying renal insufficiency,
and significant loss of renal reserve occurs after nephrectomy.19,20 This loss precludes effective dosing of chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting, providing 1 of the most
compelling reasons for pursuing the neoadjuvant
approach. Third, data indicate that the survival rates of
patients with UTCC have not improved in the past 2 decades, during a time when initial nephroureterectomy was
considered the standard of care and advances in imaging
and endoscopy presumably may have allowed earlier
detection of disease.1,7,21-23
Limitations of the neoadjuvant approach include
the probability that some patients may not tolerate both
chemotherapy and surgery. Given the association of
UTCC with elderly age and tobacco-associated comorbidities, many patients are unable to tolerate the toxic
effects of multimodality treatment. In such patients, surgery is chosen as the therapy that may offer the best chance
of cure. Another obvious limitation of the neoadjuvant
approach is the limited means of preoperative risk stratification and the possibility of over treatment in some
patients.
Particularly difficult with UTCC are the potential
inaccuracies in preoperative staging based on imaging
studies and ureteroscopy. Abdominal imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is
prone to under staging, and excretory urography or retrograde pyelography provide limited staging information.24
During ureteroscopy, the small, delicate instrumentation
used for biopsy, coupled with the risk of perforation of
the thin, muscular layers of the renal pelvis and ureteral
walls, may preclude adequate tissue sampling, unlike during transurethral resection of bladder tumors, when

Figure 2. (A,B) These are computed tomography images from a patient aged 78 years who had a biopsy-proven retrocaval
lymph node metastasis (A, arrow) associated with a right renal pelvic high-grade transitional cell carcinoma (B, arrow). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 52 mL per minute per 1.73 m2. (C,D) After the patient received gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy, there was a complete radiographic response in the primary tumor and in the lymph node metastasis.
Pathologic evaluation of the resected specimen revealed no evidence of cancer in the renal pelvis; there was evidence of an
effect of therapy in the stroma of the lamina propria and in 4 lymph nodes but no evidence of any disease in 16 other lymph
nodes. After 2.5 years of follow-up, this patient remained without evidence of disease and had an estimated GFR of 28 mL per
minute per 1.73 m2.

muscle invasion can be determined readily and an examination under anesthesia can be performed. Because the recurrence of UTCC is associated with a high likelihood of
death within 2 years, our position is that the potential for
over treatment may be justified, especially with the associated loss of renal function after nephroureterectomy.
Our current strategy is to offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy to patients who have high-risk disease. This group
includes patients with high-grade tumors demonstrated
on biopsy; with sessile architecture, which almost always
is observed with high-grade tumors; and with large-volume disease, which commonly is associated with higher
stage upper tract tumors.3,25 The results from a large, retrospective, multi-institutional study with central patho-

logic review were published recently, and multivariate
analyses from that study indicated that these factors were
highly predictive of pathologic stage.26 Because of the difficulty in accurate clinical staging, these features may be
used as surrogates for estimating high-risk pathologic disease. Although using biopsy-demonstrated, high-grade
disease alone has an approximate 66% positive predictive
value for predicting high-stage disease,6,7 the addition of
the factors described above may improve diagnostic accuracy. Survival outcomes of patients with UTCC are highly
dependent on the stage and grade of disease; high stage or
grade and lymph node metastasis confer a significant
increase in mortality. Patients with pT3 or higher disease
and those with lymph node disease have a 50% chance

Figure 3. (A,B) These computed tomography images from a patient who had a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
overuse and exposure to phenacetin reveal a large right renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with apparent parenchymal
invasion and segmental hypoperfusion. The estimated pretreatment glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 35 mL per minute per
1.73 m2 and prompted initial chemotherapy with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin. (C,D) After 3 cycles of chemotherapy,
a significant reduction in tumor volume and improvement in the GFR to 50 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 were evident, allowing
conversion of chemotherapy to a dense-dose regimen of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. Pathologic evaluation of the resected specimen revealed a 3-cm grade 3 TCC that invaded the renal parenchyma with no involvement of lymph
nodes. At 3 years of follow-up, the patient had a GFR of 35 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 and remained without evidence of
disease.

of surviving for 5 years, and the median survival duration
for patients with pT4 disease is <6 months.2 The median
survival duration for patients who have retroperitoneal or
distant metastasis is <3 years.2,26
The limitations of the current study include its retrospective nature and the absence of survival data.
Another potential criticism is the possibility that some
patients may not have undergone surgery because of progression on chemotherapy. Although we cannot be certain
that this did not happen to any patient, our experience
from clinical trials suggests that this type of event is very
unlikely. In a recent study that evaluated neoadjuvant

3132

chemotherapy for locally advanced urothelial cancer, all
patients with upper tract tumors completed chemotherapy and surgery.15 By comparing the contemporary study
group with an historic control group controlled for similar
biopsy features, we hope that we minimized the selection
bias inherent to retrospective studies. During the corresponding time periods, the treatment algorithm at our
institution largely was standardized; before 2004, >90%
of patients underwent initial surgery; and, after 2004, the
neoadjuvant approach was considered uniformly for all
patients who had high-risk features and were deemed capable of undergoing multimodality therapy. Ideally,

randomized studies would indicate definitively the relative benefit of the neoadjuvant approach, but the low incidence of this disease renders the consideration of
randomization prohibitive. Given these limitations, our
goal was to evaluate the next most reliable, readily available level of evidence that could provide justification for
continuing the neoadjuvant approach. Although survival
data will be needed to recommend the neoadjuvant strategy as a standard of care, the data described here suggest a
significant benefit of this treatment approach for high-risk
UTCC and provide justification for the continuation and
support of current trials using this strategy.
