ABSTRACT
B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation signal plays an important role in the pathogenesis
of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and kinase inhibitors directed toward the BCR
pathway are now the promising anti-leukemic drugs. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, demonstrates promising clinical activity in CLL. It is reported that ibrutinib,
additionally to directly targeting leukemic cells, also inhibits the interactions of these
cells with T cells, macrophages and accessory cells. Assessment of these mechanisms
is important because of their non -direct anti-leukemic effects and to identify possible
side effects connected with long-term drug administration.
The aim of this study was to assess the in vivo effects of ibrutinib on T-cell
subpopulations and cytokine network in CLL. The analysis was performed on a group
of 19 patients during first month of ibrutinib therapy. The standard multicolor flow
cytometry and cytometric bead array methods were used for assessment of T-cell
subsets and cytokines/chemokines, respectively.
The data obtained indicates that Ibrutinib treatment results in changes in T-cell
subpopulations and cytokine network in CLL patients. Particularly, a significant reduction
of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood was observed. By targeting these populations of
T cells Ibrutinib can stimulate rejection of tumor cells by the immune system.

aggressive disease and need immediate treatment [4, 5].
Among prognostic factors, the del17p or mutation of
the TP53 gene, are associated with a worse prognosis
[6, 7]. These mutations are the cause of resistance to most
chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of CLL
because they mediate p53-dependent apoptosis [8, 9].
Recently, a great progress has been made in therapy
of CLL. Present treatment options involve a combination
of conventional chemotherapeutics, monoclonal antibodies
and targeted signaling inhibitors. The combination of
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab, is the
conventional first-line of treatment for patients without
relevant co-existing disorders, who do not display the highrisk genetic features [6]. The elderly or non-fit patients,
should receive bendamustine or chlorambucil with an

INTRODUCTION
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most
frequent type of adult leukemias in Western Countries,
belongs to the group of lymphoproliferative disorders.
It is defined as the disease of accumulation of mature
monoclonal B cells and not their proliferation resulted
from a defective apoptotic process [1, 2, 3]. The significant
heterogeneity in the course of the disease between CLL
patients is reported. A number of prognostic parameters
like mutation status of immunoglobulin variable heavy
chain (IgVH) genes, the expression of ZAP-70 or CD38
on leukemic cells, or the presence of genetic abnormalities
may predict favorable or poor prognosis among leukemic
patients and distinguish those who could develop

a­ nti-CD20 antibody [6]. In 2014, two novel agents, blocking
the BCR signaling pathway, idelalisib and ibrutinib,
were approved as first-line treatment for patients with
poor prognostic parameters and for the relapsed disease
[10, 11]. Idelalisib targets phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
(PI3K), while ibrutinib is a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK)
inhibitor. These drugs interrupt BCR signaling leading to
the reduction of leukemic cells number. The direct effects
of ibrutinib on CLL cells are clearly observed; however, its
influence on the accessory cells, particularly in vivo, is less
well defined. The aim of this study was to assess the in vivo
effects of ibrutinib on T-cell subpopulations and cytokine
network in CLL. The analysis was performed in a group of
19 patients during first month of ibrutinib therapy.

changes in the number of CD19+, CD3+, NK (Natural
killer), and NKT (Natural killer T) lymphocytes were
assessed. In the analyzed period, we observed significant
differences in numbers of CD19+ cells from day 0 to day
30 - the mean values at day 30 were higher in comparison
to those on day 0 (Figure 1A). Total number of CD3+ cells
was lower on day 30 of therapy in comparison to day 0;
however, the difference was not statistically significant
(Figure 1B). The increase in NK cell count was observed;
however, also without statistical significance. Lastly,
NKT cells number remained at comparable level. Values
for NK and NKT cells are shown in Figure 1C and 1D,
respectively.

RESULTS

The next step of the study was to assess the CD4
and CD8 populations of T cells. There were no statistically
significant differences in the number of CD4 and CD8
cells during first month of ibrutinib therapy. The CD4/
CD8 ratio did not change, neither. However, we observed

CD8+CD3+ cells, in regards to lymphocyte population
(Figure 2A). Among CD4+CD3+ cells, both CD4RA
and CD4RO representing the naïve and memory cells,
respectively, were significantly decreased in the first
month of therapy (Figure 2B). In CD8+CD3+ population
only the percentage of CD8RO cells was decreased, while
there was no difference in percentage of CD8RA cells
(Figure 2C).

decreased in course of ibrutinib therapy (Figure 3B and
3C). Representative flow cytometry dot plots illustrating
the differences in number of Treg cells between day 0 and
day 30 are presented in Figure 4.

Ibrutinib-induced changes in the cytokines and
chemokines level
In course of ibrutinib therapy statistically significant
differences were observed only in regard to IL-10 level.
The concentration of this cytokine was statistically
significant lower at day 14 and at day 30 in comparison
to pre-treatment concentration (day 0). The differences
in regard to other cytokines analyzed in the study were
not statistically significant. Analysis of chemokines levels
during ibrutinib therapy showed statistically significant
decrease in IP-10, MCP and IL-8 levels. RANTES
concentration was higher at day 14 and 30 in comparison
to day 1 of ibrutinib therapy, however the difference was
not statistically significant.

Influence of ibrutinib therapy on Treg cells
In the presented study the assessment of regulatory
FOXP3+ cells was also performed. The results of changes
in the number and percentage of these cells at days 0,
14, and 30 of ibrutinib therapy are shown in Figure 3.
Interestingly, we observed a significantly lower number
of FOXP3+ T cells at 30 day in comparison to values
before commencing treatment (Figure 3A). Similarly,
the percentage of Tregs was statistically significant

Comparison of ibrutinib effects in standard
versus poor prognosis patients

BTK and PI3K [15]. BTK is a member of Tec family
kinases and is activated upstream by Src-family kinases.
BTK starts downstream activation of critical cell survival
pathways, such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and mitogen
activated protein-kinase (MAPK) [13, 16]. BTK mutation
in humans results in X-linked agammaglobulinemia
[13, 17].
The central role of BCR in disease pathogenesis is
that of introducing kinase inhibitors directed toward the
BCR pathway as a new promising anti-leukemic therapy
[18, 19]. Ibrutinib, a first-in-class, orally administered
inhibitor of BTK, has demonstrated promising preclinical and clinical effects in CLL [20]. The clinical
studies in relapsed/refractory older patients with CLL
reported high response rates and tolerable toxicity of the
drug [20, 21, 22]. The phase 3 clinical trail in patients
with previously treated CLL demonstrated a statistically
significant reduction in the rate of progression and death
in comparison to ofatumumab therapy [23]. Based on
these results, single-agent ibrutinib was approved for
previously treated CLL patients and for all patients with

To assess whether effect of ibrutinib therapy is
connected with CLL prognostic factors, the data was
compared in good versus poor prognosis cases. The ZAP70 positive versus ZAP-70 negative groups, CD38 positive
versus CD38 negative groups, early (0-2) versus advanced
(3-4) stages of CLL according to the Rai classification
and standard cytogenetic risk versus high cytogenetic
risk cases were analyzed, respectively. We did not find
statistically significant differences, thus prognostic factors
seem not to influence ibrutinib effects.

DISCUSSION
BCR stimulation signal launches a signaling
cascade leading to survival of leukemic cells and also
influences tissue homing and microenviroment [12, 13,
14]. Inhibition of BCR cascade can be mediated through
different pathways, including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk),

del(17p) [20] The prolonged follow-up studies confirmed
that ibrutinib therapy leads to long-lasting remissions. In
contrast to chemotherapy, which is given for a defined
time, the side-effects of ibrutinib are moderate, allowing to
continue the therapy for longer time to increase proportion
of responses [20].
Leukemic cells of CLL depend on interactions with
the microenvironment that are beneficial to their survival
via direct cell contact or through secretion of cytokines. On
the other hand, CLL cells produce cytokines that influence T
cells, macrophages or accessory cells and inhibit anti-tumor
activity [24, 25]. Disrupting these tumor-microenvironment
interactions seems to be critical for progression of the
disease. It was reported that BCR-directed kinase inhibitors,
additionally to targeting leukemic cells, inhibit interactions
of these cells with the cells of immune system. Numerous
in vitro experiments have shown that ibrutinib influences T
cells and cytokines network; however, less is known about
such effects in vivo. Assessment of these mechanisms is
important because of their non-direct anti-leukemic effects
and to identify possible side effects connected with longterm drug administration. In the presented study we focused
on evaluation of changes in lymphocytes, particularly
T cells, as well as cytokines and chemokines in patients
treated with ibrutinib during the first month of therapy.
Recently, similar studies focusing on disruption of in vivo
CLL tumor-microenvironment interactions by ibrutinib
were published as a result of Phase II study of ibrutinib
monotherapy [26, 27]. The authors indicate that serum

levels of key chemokines and inflammatory cytokines
decreased significantly in patients on ibrutinib. Moreover,
therapy decreased the overall T-cell numbers, especially
the Th17 subset of CD4 T cells. They also found that in
the bone marrow microenvironment, the drug destroyed
the interactions between macrophages and leukemic
cells by blocking CXCL13 secretion and decreasing the
chemoattraction of neoplastic cells [26]. Similarly to results
of Niemann et al. [26], we observed a decreased in T-cell
number and stable CD4/CD8 ratio. Moreover, we observed
significant lowering of percentage of both CD4+CD3+
and CD8+CD3+ cells. Among CD4+CD3+ cells, both
CD4RA and CD4RO naïve and memory cells, respectively,
were significantly decreased. In CD8+CD3+ population,
only the percentage of CD8RO cells was decreased, while
there was no difference in percentage of CD8RA cells.
Additionally we analyzed NK and NKT populations;
however, the differences in total number of these cells were
not statistically significant. We detected an increase in total
number of CD19+ cells after first month of treatment. This
is confirming results of treatment with ibrutinib described
by Byrd et al. [20] where number of lymphocytes was the
highest after 4 weeks of treatment. Such lymphocytosis
was resolved with continued therapy after 19 weeks. Also
Niemann et. al [26] reported reduction in CD19+ tumor
cell number after longer therapy with ibrutinib up to 24 to
48 weeks.
In the presented study, we report for the first time
that ibrutinib therapy reduced the number and percentage

leukemic action of T cells [29]. Ibrutinib therapy resulted
in a significant reduction of T regulatory cells in peripheral
blood shortly after beginning the therapy. Ibrutinib, by
targeting these populations of T cells, can stimulate
rejection of tumor cells by the immune system. Such
effects on Tregs in CLL were also reported for other antileukemic drugs such as fludarabine or thalidomide [30,
31]. Moreover, effects of ibrutinib on Treg cells seem to
be independent of expression of poor prognosis factors.
The last stage of our study was focused on an
assessment of cytokine and chemokine concentration during
ibrutinib therapy. Firstly, we analyzed cytokines secreted by T
helper cells subsets: Th1/Th2/Th17. We observed significant
lowering of IL-10 concentration, the cytokine produced by
Th2 cells, however no differences in Th1 and Th17 cells. It
was previously reported that ibrutinib alter the composition
of T lymphocytes subpopulations by suppression of Th1 cells
and inhibition of differentiation of Th17 T cells [26, 32]. The
levels of most chemokines analyzed in our study decreased
during first month of treatment, that is consistent with results
of Niemann et al. [26]. We observed, however an growth in
RANTES concentration. The increase in RANTES level was
reported as result of BCR stimulation and it was reduced by
BCR inhibitors [33]. Further studies, however, are required
to elucidate the status of cytokines and chemokines in longer
therapy period.
In conclusion, CLL cells depend on T cells and
cytokines interactions for their survival that are partially
mediated via BCR signals. The treatment with new BCRinhibitors, like ibrutinib, leads to the reduction of tumor cells
number both directly and via microenvironment signals.
The presented study underscores the possible influence of
ibrutinib on T cells subpopulations showing statistically
significant decrease of Treg cell subset during first month of
therapy. Further studies should elucidate precisely the role of
the drug in T cell subsets nd cytokines modulation. It may be
of importance for the effectiveness of treatment, as well as
possible side effects of long-term therapy

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated
via density gradient centrifugation in Biocoll separating
solution (density: 1.077 g/mL, Biochrom, Germany) and
washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Then the number
and viability of cells were assessed with trypan blue
staining. Viability below 95% was a disqualifying criterion
for further study. Mononuclear cells were stored in liquid
nitrogen until staining procedures. Serum was isolated and
cryopreserved at –80°C. The samples were thawed at the
time of analysis.

Assessment of T cell subpopulations by flow
cytometry method
The monoclonal antibodies directed against surface
cell antigens were used to distinguish particular cell
populations (Table 2). All monoclonal antibodies were
purchased from Becton Dickinson, USA. They were
conjugated to one of the four fluorochromes: fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) or alexa fluor 488 (AF488),
respectively, phycoerithrin (PE), peridin chlorophyll
protein (PE-Cy5), and allophycocyanin (APC). The cells
and antibody mixture were incubated for 20 minutes
at room temperature in the dark, then washed twice,
suspended again in phosphate-buffered saline and
subjected to acquisition.
The assessment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was
performed in two steps. First, monoclonal antibodies
against CD4 PE-Cy5 and CD25 PE were used to stain
surface markers. Next, fixation and permeabilization
procedures were performed. Then, co-staining of
intracellular FoxP3 via application of the AF488
conjugated anti-FoxP3 antibody was done. Using a
sequential gating strategy Tregs were identified as
CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ T cells.
Acquisition and analysis of the data were carried
out by flow cytometry method using the eight-color flow
cytometer, FACSCanto II with FACSDiva Software
(Becton Dickinson, USA). At least 10,000 cells of each
sample were collected. Cell populations were initially
gated according to forward scatter and side scatter
differentiation. For T lymphocyte analysis additional gates
for CD3, CD4, or CD8 cells were established. Analysis
was performed with the use of FACSDiva software.
The results were reported as percentages of lymphocyte
population. Based on percentages and lymphocyte
concentration the absolute cell numbers were calculated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical characteristics of analyzed patients
Nineteen CLL patients who were diagnosed in the
Department of Hematooncology, Medical University
of Lublin, and who were qualified for ibrutinib therapy,
constituted the study group. The diagnosis of CLL was
based on clinical examinations and morphological and
immunological standards. All subjects were previously
treated with other regimens. The clinical characteristics are
shown in Table 1. The local Bioethics Committee granted
permission to conduct the research and patients were
asked to sign informed consents. Samples of peripheral
blood for mononuclear cells and serum preparation were
collected on days 0, 14, and 30 of ibrutinib therapy and
then were subjected to further procedures.

performed with use of cytometric bead array (CBA)
method. Human Th1/Th2/Th17 Cytokine Kit and Human
Chemokine Kit (Becton Dickinson, USA) were used.
The cytokines/chemokines were quantified by multiplex
microsphere beads according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The beads of known size and fluorescence
were mixed with the recombinant standards or unknown
samples and incubated with the PE conjugated detection
antibodies to form sandwich complexes. The intensity of
PE fluorescence of each sandwich complex indicates the
concentration of analyzed entity.
Human Th1/Th2/Th17 Cytokine Kit measured
concentration of following cytokines: interleukin-2 (IL-2),
interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10
(IL-10), interleukin-17A (IL-17A), interferon-γ (IFN-γ)
and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF). The standard curve for
each cytokine covered a defined set of concentrations from
20 to 5000 pg/mL. Human Chemokine Kit quantitatively
measured interleukin-8 (CXCL8/IL-8), RANTES (CCL5/
RANTES), monokine induced by interferon-γ (CXCL9/
MIG), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2/MCP1) and interferon-γ induced protein-10 (CXCL10/IP-10)
levels in a single sample. The standard curve for each
chemokine covered a defined set of concentrations from 10
to 2500 pg/mL. Serum samples were diluted 1:2 prior to
procedure to ensure that their median fluorescence values
fall within the range of the generated chemokine standard
curve. The sample acquisition was performed with use of
FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA)
and data were analyzed using FCAPArrayTM software.
