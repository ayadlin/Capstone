Abstract
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of
cancer-related death worldwide. NSCLC often harbors oncogenic K-RAS mutations that lead to the aberrant activation of
several intracellular networks including the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) signaling pathway. Oncogenic K-RAS predicts poor
prognosis and resistance to treatment with ionizing radiation
(IR). Oncogenic K-Ras expression in the respiratory epithelium is sufficient to initiate NSCLC tumorigenesis, which
requires the catalytic subunit of PI3K. Thus, effective
inhibition of the PI3K signaling should lead to significant
antitumor effects. However, therapy with rapamycin analogues has yielded disappointing results due in part to
compensatory up-regulation of AKT. We hypothesized that
dual PI3K/mTOR blockade would overcome these limitations. We tested this hypothesis with BEZ235, a novel dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that has recently entered clinical
development. We found that BEZ235 induces a striking
antiproliferative effect both in transgenic mice with oncogenic
K-RAS–induced NSCLC and in NSCLC cell lines expressing
oncogenic K-RAS. We determined that treatment with BEZ235
was not sufficient to induce apoptosis. However, we found that
dual PI3K/mTOR blockade effectively sensitizes NSCLC
expressing oncogenic K-RAS to the proapoptotic effects of IR
both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that dual PI3K/mTOR
blockade in combination with IR may benefit patients with
NSCLC expressing oncogenic K-RAS. These findings may have
general applicability in cancer therapy, because aberrant
activation of PI3K occurs frequently in human cancer. [Cancer

PI3Ks are heterodimers that consist of the p110 catalytic subunit
and p85 adaptor/regulatory subunits. These enzymes catalyze the
conversion of phosphatidylinositol biphosphate to phosphatidylinositol triphosphate. Thus far, only deregulation of class IA PI3Ks
has been implicated in human cancer (2, 3).
In NSCLC, the PI3K signaling pathway is frequently deregulated
due to tumor-associated mutations affecting its upstream
regulators K-RAS or the epidermal growth factor receptor (4).
Notably, oncogenic K-RAS mutations confer a poor prognosis in
NSCLC and up-regulation of the PI3K signaling pathway predicts
resistance to cytotoxic therapies due to resistance to apoptosis
induction (5). Expression of p110a tumor-associated mutations is
oncogenic in vitro and in vivo including a mouse model of NSCLC
(6–8). Significantly, the p110a subunit of PI3K is required for
oncogenic K-Ras–induced NSCLC tumorigenesis in the mouse (9).
Moreover, phospho-S6, a downstream target of the PI3K signaling
pathway, is up-regulated on oncogenic K-Ras induction in NSCLC
of transgenic mice (8).
Phosphatidylinositol triphosphate favors AKT membrane translocation and activation of AKT through phosphorylation at Thr308
and Ser473. This event, in turn, regulates the activity of several
downstream targets involved in tumorigenesis, including the
mammalian target of rapamycin protein complex (mTORC1;
ref. 10). Notably, a rapamycin-insensitive mTOR complex
(mTORC2) has been recently identified as the kinase responsible
for AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 and consequent activation (11).
Several components of the PI3K signaling pathway have been
targeted for development of specific inhibitors capable of
antitumor activity. Patients with NSCLC harboring epidermal
growth factor receptor mutations benefit from treatment with
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib (12–14).
However, benefits are usually short-lived due to the development
of secondary drug resistance (15, 16). To date, no effective
targeted therapy exists for NSCLC tumors that harbor oncogenic
K-RAS mutations (17). Rapamycin analogues (rapalogs) have
cytostatic properties in preclinical models (18). However, these
drugs have had limited success in the clinic because they
interrupt negative feedback loops that down-regulate PI3K
signaling, causing paradoxical up-regulation of prosurvival
signaling pathways (19, 20).
NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235) is a novel, orally bioavailable dual panclass I PI3K, mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor, the structure and
pharmacologic properties of which have been described previously
(21). BEZ235 exerts antiproliferative responses in cell lines derived
from several malignancies such as breast cancer, glioblastoma, and
multiple myeloma. Notably, treatment of cancer cells with BEZ235

PI3K/mTOR Blockade Radiosensitizes NSCLC

does not up-regulate AKT activity but does increase the sensitivity
of cancer cells to chemotherapy (21–24).
Most recently, it has been reported that treatment with
BEZ235 leads to marked tumor regression in NSCLC initiated by
p110a H1047R tumor-associated mutations but not significant
regression in NSCLC initiated by oncogenic K-Ras. However,
BEZ235 administered in combination with a MEK1 inhibitor
elicited significant tumor shrinkage in transgenic mice bearing
NSCLC initiated by oncogenic K-Ras (8). These results suggest
that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition should be administered in the
context of combination therapies that affect multiple prosurvival
mechanisms.
Because DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (IR)
potently induces the PI3K signaling pathway to counteract
apoptosis (25), we hypothesized that dual PI3K/mTOR blockade
would sensitize cancer cells to the proapoptotic effects of radiation
therapy.
In this study, we characterized the antitumor effects exerted by
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition in NSCLC induced by oncogenic K-RAS
both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we show that the dual PI3K/
mTOR pharmacologic blockade synergizes with radiation therapy
inducing apoptosis in NSCLC expressing oncogenic K-RAS. We
propose that this form of combination therapy may lead to
important clinical benefits.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and reagents. Human NSCLC cell lines H23, H460, and
H2122 were provided by Dr. A.F. Gazdar (26). Mouse-derived NSCLC cell
lines LKR10 and LKR13 were provided by Dr. Jonathan M. Kurie (18).
BEZ235 was obtained from Novartis Pharma (21). LY294002 and rapamycin
were from Biosource. Inhibitors were added to mid-log-phase cell cultures
at the indicated concentrations. Control cells were incubated with medium
containing DMSO at a concentration corresponding to the highest dose
used in inhibitor-treated cells. For in vivo studies, BEZ235 was administered
by gavage daily in NMP/PEG300 (10:90, v/v; ref. 21). All other chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Clonogenic survival assays and growth curves. Clonogenic assays
were done as described previously and surviving fractions were derived
using the number of colonies formed after the treatment divided by number
of cells seeded multiplied by plating efficiency (27). Plating efficiency is the
ratio of colony number to cells seeded. Preliminary experiments showed
that the doubling time of the cells used was 24, 38, and 30 h for H460, H23,
and H2122 cells, respectively. Cells were plated in triplicate 14 to 16 h before
irradiation and/or inhibitor exposure. Cells were irradiated with a Mark I
cesium irradiator. Plates were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet 7 to
15 days after treatment. We scored colonies of >50 normal-appearing cells
and graphed the surviving fraction versus dose of IR. Survival curves were
normalized to drug cytotoxicities. D 0 and D q values, reflecting the
sensitivities and the shoulder of the survival curves of cells with or without
IR exposure, with or without inhibitor treatment, were calculated as
described (28). Experiments to calculate growth curves were done as
described (29).
Flow cytometric analyses. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight and
treated with 50 nmol/L BEZ235 with or without IR (4 Gy). Cell cycle analysis
and determination of apoptosis by propidium iodide staining were done
following a standard procedure with a FC500 Beckman Coulter flow
cytometer using the WinMDI V2.8 software (30).
Immunoblotting and antibodies. Western blotting was done as
described previously (29). The following antibodies were obtained from
Cell Signaling: AKT, Ser473 phospho-AKT, Ser235/Ser236 phospho-S6, S6,
phospho–glycogen synthase kinase-3h, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.
Tubulin and heat shock protein-90 were from Sigma-Aldrich, Ki-67 was
from Abcam, g-H2AX was from Millipore, and 53BP1 was from Bethyl labs.

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses were done as described
previously (29).
Mouse studies. CCSP-rtTA/Tet-op-K-Ras (FVB/N) mice were described
previously (31). Starting at age 8 weeks, mice were maintained on
doxycycline-impregnated food pellets (0.625 g/kg) for 10 weeks. At this
point, mice started treatment with BEZ235 or NMP/PEG300 together with
doxycycline diet for additional 2 weeks (Harlan Teklad). Tumor burden was
assessed by digital quantification of the area occupied by NSCLC compared
with unaffected lung parenchyma in three representative H&E-stained lung
sections per mouse (ImageJ).
Xenograft experiments using H460 NSCLC cells were done by s.c.
inoculation of cells into 6-week-old female athymic nude mice (nu/nu).
Xenograft tumors of 300 mm3 (7 mice per group) were treated with NMP/
PEG300, BEZ235, IR, or BEZ235 plus IR. Mice were irradiated with 4 Gy
every other day for five treatments using an X-RAD 320 irradiator (Precision
X-ray) to deliver local irradiation to the flank or thigh of lead-shielded mice.
BEZ235 was administered daily for 7 days. In combination therapy, we
administered BEZ235 2 h before IR exposure. Tumor volumes were
calculated three times weekly using the formula: (length  width2) / 2.
Orthotopic lung growth of H460 tumors was achieved by tail vein
injection of 1  106 H460 cells expressing firefly luciferase.
All studies were done according to the guidelines of the University of
Texas Southwestern Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Statistical analyses. All data presented are the average F SD of
experiments repeated three or more times. Significance was determined
using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test or the one-way ANOVA test. Curve
fitting for the radiosensitization experiments was done using the linearquadratic formula: exp(aD + hD2), which has two components of cell killing:
one is proportional to the dose of IR (aD) and the other is proportional to
the square of the dose of IR (hD2; refs. 27, 32).

Results
Dual inhibition of PI3K/mTOR leads to a striking
antitumor effect in transgenic mice with NSCLC induced by
oncogenic K-Ras. We used CCSP-rtTA/Tet-op-K-Ras bitransgenic
mice, which express oncogenic K-Ras under the control of the
tetracycline operator (Tet-op) and the reverse tetracycline transactivator under the control of the clara cell secretory protein
promoter (CCSP-rtTA). In these mice, exposure to doxycycline
faithfully reproduces the events leading to NSCLC tumorigenesis
with 100% penetrance (31).
We hypothesized that pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K
signaling pathway would lead to a significant antitumor effect. We
tested the antitumor properties of BEZ235, a novel and specific
dual pan inhibitor of PI3K and mTORC complexes (mTORC1 and
mTORC2), undergoing clinical testing in cancer patients.
We treated CCSP-rtTA/Tet-op-K-Ras mice with doxycycline for
10 weeks (Fig. 1A). At this time point, mice were divided into three
cohorts of 8 mice each. A cohort was sacrificed before starting
treatment to evaluate baseline NSCLC burden. The treatment
cohort received 45 mg/kg BEZ235 and the placebo group received
NMP/PEG300 by oral gavage together with doxycycline daily for 2
additional weeks. We selected this BEZ235 dose and schedule of
administration because of a previous study that showed that this
dose of BEZ235 achieves maximum intratumoral inhibition of PI3K
signaling within 1 h of administration and steady-state serum levels
between 3 and 5 days (21).
As expected, mice exposed to doxycycline developed multiple
large, solid-type adenomas and adenocarcinomas in all lung fields.
Pathologic examination of sections stained with H&E revealed no
significant morphologic abnormalities between NSCLC present in
mice treated with BEZ235 or placebo. Next, we determined that the

tumor burden of mice treated with BEZ235 was <50% of the tumor
burden of mice treated with placebo and comparable with the
tumor burden present in mice of the baseline control group
(Fig. 1A and B). Treatment with BEZ235 suppressed NSCLC growth
but not the number of NSCLC foci.
We determined that treatment with BEZ235 led to a significant
decrease of the level of phospho-S6 and phospho-AKT in NSCLC
(Fig. 1B and C). We also determined that treatment with BEZ235
led to a significant decrease in mitotic activity within NSCLC

positive for Ki-67 in control mice, with positive cells preferentially
located at the periphery of tumor nodules, whereas only 5% of
NSCLC cells were positive in BEZ235-treated mice (Fig. 1B). We
detected no appreciable induction of apoptosis by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
and cleaved caspase-3 staining (data not shown).

control mice. This analysis revealed no abnormalities. Similarly, we
noted no obvious toxicities clinically or by pathologic examination
of major organs (data not shown). This conclusion is in agreement
with published data (8, 21, 23).
Thus, treatment with BEZ235 in vivo caused an efficient
inhibition of PI3K signaling in lung tissue without significant

compensatory up-regulation of phospho-AKT. This antitumor
response appeared to be mediated by antiproliferative effects that
occur in the absence of apoptosis.

transgenic mice) and H23, H460, and H2122 cells (derived from
human NSCLC specimens and harbor oncogenic K-RAS mutations;

of the p53 tumor suppressor, whereas H460 cells do not. Finally, the

subunit of PI3K.6

We found that BEZ235 caused a significant decrease in the level of
phospho-AKT and almost completely inhibited phosphorylation of
S6 protein at a concentration between 50 and 150 nmol/L across the
different cell lines. These effects were comparable with those exerted
by 10 Amol/L LY294002, a well-known inhibitor of PI3K (Fig. 2A).
Next, we determined that dual PI3K/mTOR blockade with
150 nmol/L BEZ235 strikingly inhibited the proliferation of LKR10,
LKR13, H23, H460, and H2122 cells (Fig. 2B; Supplementary
Fig. S1A). We also compared the effect exerted by BEZ235 to the
effects exerted by 10 nmol/L rapamycin (that inhibits mTORC1),
10 Amol/L LY294002, or a combination of the two in H23, H460,
and H2122 cells. We concluded that combination treatment with

LY294002 together with rapamycin led to antiproliferative effects
that were indistinguishable from responses obtained with BEZ235
(Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S1A).
We determined that BEZ235 treatment leads to growth arrest
in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a minor population of
apoptotic cells in all NSCLC cells tested. These analyses were
done 24 and 48 h after treatment with equivalent results (Fig. 2C;
Supplementary Fig. S1B; data not shown).

Taken together, these data lead to the conclusion that dual
PI3K/mTOR blockade with BEZ235 is more effective in inducing
antiproliferative effects than treatment with single agents
blocking either PI3K or mTORC1. Moreover, these data strongly
suggest that these antiproliferative effects were mainly due to G1
cell cycle arrest.
Dual PI3K/mTOR blockade sensitizes oncogenic K-RAS–
expressing NSCLC cells to the proapoptotic effects of IR. Our
results indicate that dual PI3K/mTOR blockade is not sufficient
to efficiently induce apoptosis in NSCLC induced by oncogenic
K-Ras in vivo and in NSCLC-derived cell lines. Because AKT has
been implicated in cell survival responses after IR exposure, we
hypothesized that the combination of IR with PI3K/mTOR
blockade would lead to proapoptotic effects (25, 33, 34).
Therefore, we tested whether dual PI3K/mTOR blockade
sensitized NSCLC cells expressing oncogenic K-RAS to the
antiproliferative effects of IR.
We performed clonogenic survival assays on H23, H460, and
H2122 NSCLC cells exposed to increasing doses of IR (1-6 Gy) in the
presence of 50 nmol/L BEZ235, the lowest dose that efficiently
inhibited colony formation (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S2A).
According to preliminary experiments, continuous incubation with
BEZ235 at 50 nmol/L completely inhibited colony formation,
whereas transient exposure for 24 h did not cause significant
reduction in plating efficiency (Supplementary Table S1). Therefore,
we administered BEZ235 2 h before exposure to IR and limited the
incubation time to 24 h.
Analyses of the radiosensitizing effects of BEZ235 indicated that
addition of this inhibitor decreased the shoulders (D q) of the
survival curves for all cell lines treated while concomitantly
increasing the radiosensitivities (D 0) of exposed cells. Most
importantly, the presence of BEZ235 on all irradiated cells
increased dose enhancement ratios with values ranging between
2.8 and 1.8 (Supplementary Table S2). These data suggested that
addition of BEZ235 inhibits DNA repair and/or augments DNA
damage created by IR possibly by altered cell cycle checkpoint
responses.
BEZ235 efficiently inhibited S6 and glycogen synthase kinase-3h
phosphorylation induced by IR in H460 and H23 cells (Fig. 3B). In
addition, BEZ235 induced a significant poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, a well-known marker of apoptosis, 3, 18, and 24 h after
IR (Fig. 3B). Next, we determined the percentage of sub-G1 cells
present in H23, H460, and H2122 cell cultures exposed to BEZ235
or to BEZ235 + IR. Also, these analyses supported the conclusion
that treatment with BEZ235 significantly increased the percentage
of irradiated cells undergoing apoptosis (P < 0.05; Fig. 3B and C;
Supplementary Fig. S2B).
We detected the same percentage of apoptosis in H23 and H2122
cells (which express mutant p53) and H460 cells (which express
wild-type p53). This observation suggests that the response of
NSCLC cells to BEZ235 + IR is independent of p53 (Fig. 3B and C;
Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Radiosensitization induced by PI3K/mTOR blockade is
accompanied by persistence of DNA damage foci. Our data
suggested that BEZ235 could facilitate apoptosis induced by IR by
promoting increased or persistent DNA damage. Thus, we examined
whether BEZ235 affected induction and repair of DNA breaks after
IR exposure in H23 and H460 cells. We determined that resolution of
g-H2AX and 53BP1 foci, two well-known markers of DNA doublestrand break damage and repair (when foci decrease), occurred
rapidly after treatment with IR (2 Gy). In contrast, treatment with

BEZ235 in combination with IR (2 Gy) led to a dramatic persistence
of g-H2AX and 53BP1 foci at 24 h post-IR administration compared
with exposure with IR alone. However, BEZ235 exerted a discordant
effect on the number of g-H2AX and 53BP1 foci 30 min after IR in
the cell lines we tested. Treatment with BEZ235 alone did not induce
g-H2AX or 53BP1 foci above background levels (Fig. 4A-C;
Supplementary Figs. S3A and B and S4).
These results indicate that dual PI3K/mTOR blockade with
BEZ235 leads to persistent DNA damage induced by IR in
oncogenic K-RAS–expressing NSCLC cells either because of
inhibition of DNA repair or augmentation of damage by cell cycle
checkpoint abrogation. These observations also suggest that IR
therapy could be exploited to sensitize cancer cells to therapy with
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
Combination of PI3K/mTOR pathway blockade and radiation therapy is an effective antitumor strategy in vivo. We
tested the antitumor effects of dual PI3K/mTOR blockade in
combination with IR in H460 NSCLC xenografts, a well-established
model of aggressive NSCLC with up-regulation of the PI3K/mTOR
signaling cascade due to oncogenic K-RAS and p110a mutations
(35).6 Moreover, this cell line is a representative of the cells we used
in tissue culture experiments.
We generated four cohorts of 7 mice bearing xenografts of 300
mm3 average size. Treatments regimens were as follows: (a)
placebo, (b) 45 mg/kg BEZ235 daily for 7 days, (c) IR treatment
alone ( five 4 Gy fractions over 10 days), and (d) 45 mg/kg BEZ235 +
five 4 Gy fractions over 10 days. Preliminary experiments showed
that 45 mg/kg BEZ235 administered daily for 7 days has limited
antiproliferative effects in this xenograft model.
Mice were irradiated 2 h following drug administration because
pharmacokinetic studies indicated that, within this time frame,
BEZ235 achieves effective intratumoral concentrations (21). We

chose this radiation dose and schedule of administration based on
preliminary data that indicated that 20 Gy (administered in
fractionated doses every other day) elicits an antitumor response
that is not curative in this xenograft model. We chose a
fractionated dose to limit overall tissue toxicity and mimic the
administration modality used in the clinic (36). Notably, this
xenograft volume and IR dose is compatible with previous studies
involving H460 xenografts (37).
Treatment with BEZ235 in combination with IR resulted in >90%
reduction in xenograft volume when compared with treatment
with IR 45 days after completion of therapy (P < 0.001). As
expected, IR treatment induced an antitumor response (P < 0.05)
compared with control H460 xenografts. In contrast, single
treatment with BEZ235 induced a modest antitumor response
that was not statistically significant. All mice in the placebo and
BEZ235 treatment groups were euthanized within 10 and 16 days
of initiation of treatment, respectively, due to excessive tumor
burden. Two mice in the IR treatment group were euthanized
25 and 40 days after initiation of treatment. In contrast, 2 mice of
the combination therapy group were apparently tumor-free 45 days
after initiation of treatment (Fig. 5A-C).
Combination therapy with BEZ235 and IR was well tolerated in
xenograft-bearing mice, although we observed a nonstatistically
significant acute drop in body weight of 5% to 10% in the IR and
combination treatment groups that resolved 10 days after
completion of treatment (data not shown).
We assessed whether combination therapy with BEZ235 and IR
induces acute lung toxicity. For this purpose, we generated
orthotopic xenografts of H460 cells expressing firefly luciferase.
We used luciferase imaging to monitor tumorigenesis. We treated
mice with comparable tumor burden with placebo, IR, BEZ235, or
BEZ235 in combination with IR (Supplementary Fig. S5A).

PI3K/mTOR Blockade Radiosensitizes NSCLC

Histologic analysis detected no evidence of acute toxicity in the
respiratory epithelium and lung vasculature after treatment with
either IR or BEZ235 in combination with IR. As expected, histologic
analysis of paraffin-embedded lung tissue confirmed that combination therapy leads to a dramatic reduction in tumor burden
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). Moreover, NSCLC treated with BEZ235
and BEZ235 in combination with IR showed histologic changes
consistent with IR-induced cellular damage such as picnotic nuclei
and foamy cellular inclusions (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
These results indicate that the dual PI3K/mTOR blockade with
BEZ235 leads to significant antitumor effects in vivo in the absence
of acute lung toxicity (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Discussion
Aberrant up-regulation of the PI3K signaling pathway occurs
commonly in NSCLC. This event is frequently mediated by
oncogenic K-RAS mutations. Significantly, expression of oncogenic
K-RAS in the respiratory epithelium is also required for maintenance of NSCLC (31). However, no effective inhibitors of oncogenic
K-RAS have been developed to date. This is an unmet clinical need
because oncogenic K-RAS, the most commonly mutated human
proto-oncogene, not only contributes to the tumorigenesis of
f30% of NSCLC but also confers a poor prognosis and resistance
to therapy (34, 38–40).
In the absence of effective K-RAS inhibitors, mTORC1 inhibitors
have been tested as anticancer drugs in NSCLC. This class of drugs
leads to antiproliferative effects in cell culture. However, rapalogs
have shown limited antitumor effects in vivo (18). This lack of
effectiveness has been attributed to the inability of rapalogs to
inhibit mTORC2 and to the fact that they interrupt several
feedback loops ultimately leading to activation of AKT (19, 20). We
sought to overcome these limitations with BEZ235, a pan-PI3K
inhibitor that also targets the mTORC2 complex.
We found that dual PI3K/mTOR blockade exerts potent
antiproliferative effects but lacks significant proapoptotic properties in oncogenic K-RAS–induced NSCLC.
These results are surprising because genetic evidence has
convincingly shown that the p110a subunit of PI3K is required
for oncogenic K-Ras–induced NSCLC (9). Therefore, we propose
that PI3K function is essential for NSCLC initiation but not for its
maintenance.
Our report provides the first demonstration that dual PI3K/
mTOR blockade is an effective strategy to sensitize NSCLC cancer
cells expressing oncogenic K-RAS to the proapoptotic effects of IR
without evidence of acute lung radiation injury. This radiosensitizing effect appears to be independent of p53, a master regulator of
the DNA damage response (41). On the contrary, rapalogs in
association with IR induce a G2-M block but not significant cell
death (42).

Our data suggest that BEZ235 in combination with IR either
inhibits DNA repair (seen by decreased D q values and persistent
DNA damage) or augments DNA damage (seen by decreased D 0
values, high dose enhancement ratio, and enhanced formation of
foci due to double-strand breaks). In this setting, apoptosis may be
caused by inhibition of prosurvival stress responses (including DNA
repair) activated by IR and by abrogation of cell cycle checkpoints
or mitotic catastrophe (43). Our observation that BEZ235 induces
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage at early time points after IR
administration suggests the hypothesis that apoptosis is induced
by inhibition of prosurvival responses.
BEZ235 and several other dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are being
tested in phase I/II clinical trials. Therefore, our work provides
several relevant preclinical data for the design of therapeutic
protocols using this novel class of drugs.
In this regard, we add to the evidence that dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibition as single therapy leads mainly to cytostatic antitumor
effects. However, concomitant administration of IR, chemotherapy,
or a MEK1 inhibitor with dual PI3K/mTOR blockade is sufficient to
induce apoptosis (8, 21, 24). Thus, we propose that dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors should be used in the clinic in combination with
agents that either promote apoptosis or disable prosurvival
networks.
We also speculate that PI3K/mTOR blockade in combination
with IR may be an effective form of therapy also for NSCLC
expressing epidermal growth factor receptor or p110a tumorassociated mutations and in other malignancies where the PI3K
signaling pathway is up-regulated independently of oncogenic
K-RAS. In this regard, we found that dual PI3K/mTOR blockade
induces similar effects in a panel of NSCLC-derived cell lines that
display up-regulation of the PI3K signaling pathway that includes
epidermal growth factor receptor mutations resistant to tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (35).7
In the future, it will be of interest to determine the cellular
networks responsible for the antitumor effects induced by PI3K/
mTOR blockade, optimize this form of therapy, and identify
biomarkers to predict clinical response.
