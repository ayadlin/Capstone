ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by the accumulation of unfolded
proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which activates the unfolded protein
response (UPR). However, the role of ER stress in tumor initiation and progression is
controversial. To determine the impact of ER stress, we applied tauroursodeoxycholic
acid (TUDCA), a bile acid with chaperone properties. The effects of TUDCA were
assessed using a diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCC model in preventive
and therapeutic settings. Cell metabolic activity, proliferation and invasion were
investigated in vitro. Tumor progression was assessed in the HepG2 xenograft model.
Administration of TUDCA in the preventive setting reduced carcinogen-induced
elevation of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, apoptosis of hepatocytes
and tumor burden. TUDCA also reduced eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIf2α)
phosphorylation, C/EBP homologous protein expression and caspase-12 processing.
Thus, TUDCA suppresses carcinogen-induced pro-apoptotic UPR. TUDCA alleviated
hepatic inflammation by increasing NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. Furthermore, TUDCA altered
the invasive phenotype and enhanced metabolic activity but not proliferation in HCC
cells. TUDCA administration after tumor development did not alter orthotopic tumor
or xenograft growth. Taken together, TUDCA attenuates hepatocarcinogenesis by
suppressing carcinogen-induced ER stress-mediated cell death and inflammation
without stimulating tumor progression. Therefore, this chemical chaperone could
represent a novel chemopreventive agent.

[1]. For the majority of patients with locally advanced
disease, however, the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib
and transarterial embolization are the only approved
treatments. Unfortunately, both of these treatments provide
a limited survival benefit [1]. Given that risk factors for
HCC, such as liver cirrhosis, are fairly well established,
chemopreventive strategies may help combat the disease.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the second
leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and is
frequently associated with liver cirrhosis [1, 2]. Resection
and transplantation are the only potentially curative
treatments available following detection of a small HCC

Ideally, these drugs should be safe for long-term use in the
at-risk population. However, no chemopreventive drugs are
currently available for HCC [3].
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a hydrophilic
bile acid that is produced endogenously in humans at very
low levels [4]. TUDCA is synthesized in the conjugation
pathway of ursodeoxycholic acid, which is effectively used
for treating cholestatic liver diseases, including primary
biliary cirrhosis, without major adverse reactions [4].
These hydrophilic bile acids act as bile secretagogues and
immunomodulators that can prevent apoptosis induced by
several agents, such as hydrophobic bile acids, alcohol,
transforming growth factor β1, and Fas ligand, in hepatic
and non-hepatic cells [5, 6]. In addition, TUDCA protects
rat livers during long-term ethanol feeding [7] and human
livers from ischemia-reperfusion injury during harvesting
and cold storage [8]. The mechanisms involved in the
antiapoptotic properties of TUDCA include targeting
mitochondrial function and integrity and interactions with
the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) signaling pathways [9].
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important
organelle required for cell survival and is highly sensitive
to homeostatic alterations. Disruption of ER homeostasis
leads to the accumulation of unfolded proteins, which
disturb ER function and result in a state known as ER
stress [10]. In resting cells, all ER stress receptors are
maintained in an inactive state through association with
the ER chaperone glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa
(Grp78). Upon ER stress, Grp78 dissociates and triggers
the unfolded protein response (UPR), which orchestrates
cellular adaptation to stress by inducing transcriptional
programs and by repressing global translation by
eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIf2α) phosphorylation
[11]. However, if the stress is too severe, UPR signaling
switches from a pro-survival to a pro-apoptotic state,
leading to increased pro-apoptotic transcription factor
C/EBP homologous protein (Chop) expression and the

cleavage of procaspase-12 to its active caspase-12 form
[11]. Interestingly, the UPR is activated in several liver
diseases, including fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis,
alcohol-induced liver injury and HCC [12, 13].
Importantly, TUDCA has been shown to act as a
chemical chaperone that decreases UPR signaling and
protects hepatocytes against cytotoxicity caused by the ER
stress inducer thapsigargin [14, 15]. TUDCA has also been
shown to abolish ER stress-induced caspase-12 processing
and to subsequently inhibit effector caspases-3/7 activation
and apoptosis [15].
Recent studies have demonstrated that hepatocyte
apoptosis is a pathogenic event in several liver diseases
[13, 16]. Chronically increased hepatocyte apoptosis
in genetic mouse models is carcinogenic and leads to
compensatory liver regeneration, oxidative stress and DNA
hypermethylation [16, 17]. In this study, we investigated the
preventive and therapeutic potential of TUDCA in HCC.
Our data demonstrate that TUDCA reduces carcinogeninduced liver dysfunction and HCC incidence, likely
through the prevention of ER stress-induced apoptosis
and inflammation. Importantly, once HCC nodules are
established, TUDCA does not modulate tumor growth.

RESULTS
Preventive administration of TUDCA reduces
HCC burden in an orthotopic mouse model
The ER stress-inducing hepatocarcinogen diethy­
lnitrosamine (DEN) promotes multifocal HCC after 25
weeks of administration [18, 19]. To explore the effects of
TUDCA on hepatocarcinogenesis, we supplemented the
animals with low or high dose TUDCA in their drinking
water. Administration of DEN resulted in reduced body
weights and 25% increased mortality (p < 0.001; Table 1)
compared to saline administration. TUDCA treatment did

not affect the weight loss or mortality of DEN-treated
mice, and no clinical signs of toxicity were observed in
any of the TUDCA-treated groups.
DEN-treated mice that received low- or highdose TUDCA developed fewer nodules per liver (all
sizes: 18.9 ± 5.3 after vehicle versus 11.5 ± 3.9 after
low-dose TUDCA [p < 0.01] and 12.3 ± 4.1 after highdose TUDCA [p < 0.05]). HCC burden, quantified
by the loss of reticulin staining, was reduced in DENtreated mice following the co-administration of low- or
high-dose TUDCA (p < 0.01; Figure 1A–1C). Choline
positron emission tomography, which visualizes cellular
membrane biosynthesis, demonstrated that administration
of low-dose TUDCA in DEN-treated mice resulted in
fewer hepatic loci with high mean standardized uptake
values compared with animals receiving vehicle alone
(p < 0.05; Figure 1D–1E). Repeated DEN administration
induces HCC in a background of liver fibrosis [18].
However, no difference in grade of fibrosis, as determined
by Sirius Red staining, was found between TUDCA- and
vehicle-treated livers (data not shown).
DEN administration increased the levels of serum
ALT and AST compared to saline administration (p <
0.001; Figure 2A). Importantly, serum ALT and AST levels
were reduced in DEN-treated mice receiving TUDCAsupplemented drinking water compared to those receiving
regular drinking water (p < 0.05; Figure 2A). This suggests
that both low- and high-dose TUDCA protect the liver
from DEN-induced hepatotoxicity. Collectively, these data
indicate that TUDCA decreases the susceptibility of mice to
DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a preventive setting.

carcinogen exposure consistently reduced the expression
of Grp78 and Chop and inhibited eIf2α phosphorylation,
thereby possibly restoring global translation (Figure 3A–3B).
Caspase-12, the central player in ER stress-induced apoptosis
[11], was markedly activated by both tunicamycin and
DEN administration, whereas TUDCA reduced the DENinduced cleavage of procaspase-12 (p < 0.05; Figure 3C).
Overall, these data strongly suggest that TUDCA decreases
carcinogen-induced ER stress and thereby attenuates caspase12-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis.

TUDCA increases cellular metabolic activity
independent of ER stress
To further explore the effect of TUDCA on cell
viability and proliferation, HepG2, BWTG3 and Hepa1-6
cells were incubated with a dilution series of TUDCA.
As shown by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in
the cell supernatant, TUDCA at 0.1–1 mM did not induce
cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells (Supplementary Figure
S1A). At 10 mM, however, TUDCA increased the LDH
activity (p < 0.001). Next, we examined the effect of
TUDCA on the MTT metabolic activity of cells under
basal conditions. The reduction of tetrazolium salts such
as MTT depends on both cellular metabolic activity
and proliferation rate. Intriguingly, 0.1–1 mM TUDCA
increased the MTT metabolic activity of HepG2 cells in
a dose-dependent manner to supranormal levels of up
to 150% (p < 0.001; Figure 3D). Incorporation of the
thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the
DNA of HepG2 cells under basal conditions showed that
TUDCA modestly decreased the cell proliferation rate at
1 mM (p < 0.05, Supplementary Figure S1B). Furthermore,
we directly counted HepG2 cells after 48 h of incubation
with 0.1–1 mM TUDCA and found no difference in cell
number compared to controls (data not shown). The MTT
metabolic activity and BrdU incorporation experiments
were repeated in BWTG3 and Hepa1-6 cells with similar
results (Supplementary Figure S1C–S1F). These data
suggest that, under basal conditions, TUDCA dosedependently enhances cellular metabolic activity without
increasing the absolute number of cells.
Next, we examined whether TUDCA would have the
same effects in the presence of ER stress [11]. Tunicamycin
(0.5 μg/ml) did not alter MTT metabolic activity or LDH
release in HepG2 cells, suggesting no inherent cytotoxicity
at the concentration used (Figure 3D and Supplementary
Figure S1A, respectively). However, tunicamycin did impair
BrdU incorporation (p < 0.01; Supplementary Figure S1B),
confirming the well-known ER stress-mediated induction of
cell cycle arrest [11]. Finally, TUDCA was able to enhance
cellular metabolic activity even in the presence of acute ER
stress (Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure S1C–S1D);
however, this had no effect on the antiproliferative effect of
ER stress (Supplementary Figure S1B and Supplementary
Figure S1E–S1F).

TUDCA attenuates UPR-induced apoptosis in
DEN-treated mice
Repeated DEN administration results in significant
apoptosis and ER stress in hepatocytes [18, 19]. We
measured the activity of effector caspase-3/7 ex vivo and, as
expected, observed increased levels in DEN-treated mouse
livers (p < 0.001, Figure 2B). Interestingly, the hepatic
caspase-3/7 activity was lower in DEN/TUDCA-treated
mice compared to DEN/vehicle-treated mice (Figure 2B).
In agreement with these data, TUNEL immunofluorescence
demonstrated a significant reduction of TUNEL-positive
hepatocytes following TUDCA supplementation (p <
0.05, Figure 2C–2D), thus confirming reduced hepatocyte
apoptosis upon DEN challenge.
Grp78 and Chop expression and eIf2α phosphory­
lation were increased in the mice treated with DEN,
reflecting robust UPR activation (Figure 3A–3B). As a
positive control, tunicamycin, a nucleoside antibiotic that
inhibits protein glycosylation and thereby elicits acute
ER stress [11], was administered to naive mice. These
control mice showed significantly increased expression of
Grp78 and Chop and eIf2α phosphorylation (Figure  3B).

stress response [10]. Thus, we evaluated the effect of
TUDCA on the cytotoxicity of H2O2-induced oxidative
stress in HepG2 cells. Cell viability declined following the
addition of 1–5 mM of H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner

administration resulted in substantial accumulation of
MDA protein adducts (p < 0.001), and this was found to
be unaltered by TUDCA supplementation (Supplementary
Figure S2C). Thus, the chemopreventive action of TUDCA
seems to be independent of oxidative stress.

hepatocarcinogenesis [28]. Using salubrinal, which inhibits
eIf2α de-phosphorylation, we confirmed that sustained eIf2α
phosphorylation leads to translational repression of IκBα in
HepG2 cells (data not shown). Because DEN-induced eIf2α
phosphorylation was abolished by TUDCA supplementation
(Figure 3B), we assessed the effect of TUDCA on hepatic
IκBα expression and NF-κB activation to investigate this
potential mechanism of action. Interestingly, TUDCA
supplementation restored IκBα expression and slightly
decreased phospho-NFκB p65 levels, the active form of
NF-κB, in the DEN-treated livers (Figure 4D–4E). These
data indicate that TUDCA suppresses the immune response
to DEN-induced liver injury by reducing phospho-eIf2αmediated repression of IκBα translation.

TUDCA does not affect DEN-induced
autophagic flux
ER stress is able to induce autophagy [21], which
has been shown to protect against hepatocarcinogenesis
[22]. We therefore tested whether TUDCA modulates
autophagy in vivo (Supplementary Figure S3). DENtreated liver tissue exhibited enhanced expression of
Beclin-1 and increased conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II,
indicating the activation of autophagic signals. The cellular
content of p62, a receptor and substrate of selective
autophagy, is a critical indicator of autophagic flux
[23]. Immunoblotting for p62 showed that DEN slightly
decreased the hepatic p62 content (Supplementary Figure
S3A). TUDCA administration did not alter the stably
elevated LC3 conversion and reduced p62 content. Thus,
TUDCA was unable to alter the enhanced autophagic flux.

TUDCA alters invasiveness in vitro
Because ER stress was previously linked to cell
invasion [29, 30], we questioned whether TUDCA could
modify HCC cell invasion in vitro. Therefore, we examined
the effect of TUDCA in a hepatocyte growth factor-induced
invasion assay in which spheroids of the Hepa1-6 HCC
cell line embedded in collagen matrix were observed over
time (Figure 5A–5C). TUDCA decreased the sphere area
after 60 h of incubation (p < 0.05; Figure 5A), whereas
the perimeter of the TUDCA-treated spheres increased
compared with controls after 24 (p < 0.001) and 48 h
(p < 0.05) of incubation (Figure 5B). Although TUDCA may
have decreased sphere area by affecting cell proliferation in
this context (e.g., as observed for HepG2 in Figure 3B), the
larger perimeter combined with a smaller area suggests an
altered invasive phenotype. This result was also supported
by the more irregular sphere shape observed upon invasion
in the presence of TUDCA (Figure 5C). However, in a
Boyden chamber assay, addition of 1–2 mM of TUDCA
induced no significant alterations in the hepatocyte growth
factor-stimulated invasion of the HCC cells over a 48-hour
period (Figure 5D).
Degradation of the extracellular matrix is one
pivotal step and occurs due to the actions of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP). MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP14 enzymes play important roles in the degradation of the
extracellular matrix and exist extensively in HCC tissues.
MMP profiling showed that addition of TUDCA did not
alter the protein levels of MMP-2, -9 and -14 (Figure 5E).
Accordingly, we observed no changes in the extracellular
MMP-2 and -9 activity in the concentrated conditioned
medium (Figure 5F). In conclusion, although TUDCA
alters the invasive phenotype, TUDCA does not induce
increased HCC cell invasion.

TUDCA attenuates DEN-induced hepatic
inflammation
Human HCC usually develops in the background
of chronic hepatic inflammation [1]. Repeated DENinduced murine tumors share similar pathogenesis [18],
where pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6
(IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), promote
tumor development [24]. Indeed, accumulating evidence
suggests extensive cross-talk between the UPR and
the inflammatory response [25]. Chop-deficient livers
have been shown to exhibit reduced inflammation and
hepatocarcinogenesis [26]. Because TUDCA abolished
the DEN-induced Chop expression in our study, we
hypothesized that TUDCA might alter DEN-induced
hepatic inflammation. Immunohistochemical staining
demonstrated robust accumulation of F4/80+ macrophages
in the livers of animals treated with DEN for 25 weeks
(Figure 4A–4B). However, TUDCA significantly decreased
the number of liver-infiltrating macrophages (p < 0.05).
Using multiplex microbead immunoassays, we observed
that hepatic expression of inflammatory cytokines,
including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, keratinocytederived chemokine (KC), monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (Mcp-1), and TNF-α, was augmented following
DEN administration. Importantly, IL-6 (p < 0.05), KC (p <
0.05) and TNF-α (p < 0.01) levels were reduced following
TUDCA supplementation (Figure 4C).
Elevated eIf2α phosphorylation leads to
translational repression of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα
and thereby promotes NF-κB signaling [27], which
exerts a pro-carcinogenic role in inflammation-related

activity, we evaluated whether TUDCA could stimulate

assess the effect of TUDCA on established tumors,
we used orthotopic and xenograft mouse models of
HCC. Following orthotopic HCC induction with 25
weeks of DEN, 5 weeks of low- or high-dose TUDCA
supplementation had no significant effect on mortality
(Table 1) or tumor number (all sizes: 17.4 ± 4.9 after
vehicle versus 19.7 ± 4.5 after low-dose TUDCA and 18.8
± 5.3 after high-dose TUDCA). Accordingly, microscopic
quantification confirmed that TUDCA produced no
significant effects on HCC burden (Figure 6A–6C).
Next, we investigated the effects of 5 weeks of TUDCA
supplementation following 25 weeks of DEN-induced
tumor development on the UPR (Figure 6D–6E). TUDCA
did not alter the protein levels of Chop or phospho-eIf2α in
HCC-bearing livers (Figure 6E). Moreover, no difference
in the apoptosis rate was observed (data not shown). These
results suggest that TUDCA was unable to restore ER
function after prolonged hepatocarcinogen exposure.
In the HepG2 xenograft model, TUDCA
supplementation for 5 weeks did not significantly modify
tumor growth compared to control treatment (Figure 6F–
6G), and no mortality occurred in any of these groups.
Finally, no metastases were detected in any group of the
preventive or therapeutic settings of the orthotopic or of
the HepG2 xenograft model.

tumor burden in our mouse models. However, the trend
of reduced weight and survival was only observed in
the high-dose TUDCA group. This reduction in body
weight was also observed in a mouse model of retinitis
pigmentosa, where animals were treated with high-dose
TUDCA (500 mg/kg/day) [33]. Additionally, TUDCA has
been shown to increase energy expenditure by promoting
intracellular thyroid hormone activation [34]. Therefore,
a low dose of TUDCA is advisable for chemoprevention.
Chemically improving the ER folding capacity by
TUDCA administration was previously shown to protect
from UPR signaling and ER stress-induced apoptosis,
which are primarily regulated by the phospho-eIf2α\
Chop cascade [10, 15]. Although Chop plays critical
pro-apoptotic roles, it was recently shown to promote
carcinogenesis in a DEN-induced model of HCC [26].
Accordingly, TUDCA efficiently diminished Chop
expression and tumorigenesis during carcinogen exposure
in our study.
In hepatocytes, DEN is metabolized by cytochrome
P450 2E1 through a ROS-generating reaction that induces
liver injury and DNA damage [35, 36]. Subsequently,
danger signals released from injured hepatocytes induce
liver inflammation. Accordingly, certain antioxidants,
such as N-acetylcysteine [35] or lycopene [37], have been
shown to attenuate DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
Of note, N-acetylcysteine was recently shown to accelerate
lung cancer progression in mice [38]. Because TUDCA
did not affect oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in
vitro or hepatic oxidative stress in vivo, we presume that
the chemopreventive effect of TUDCA was not mediated
by directly antagonizing oxidative stress but rather by
modulating ER stress-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the
combination of TUDCA with antioxidants could represent
a dual-targeting chemopreventive strategy for HCC.
HCC has been characterized as a chronic
inflammation-driven cancer, and chemically induced
models have revealed the crucial roles of inflammatory
signaling in disease onset and severity [35]. Therefore, we
assessed whether TUDCA affected tumor-immune system
crosstalk. TUDCA administration resulted in a decrease in
hepatic macrophage infiltration and IL-6, KC and TNF-α
levels. These results suggest that TUDCA attenuates
inflammation in response to DEN-induced liver injury
and thus interrupts positive feedback from inflammationinduced ER stress and UPR-induced inflammation [13].
Interestingly, a similar effect of TUDCA on macrophage
infiltration and TNF-α expression was also recently
observed in a model of ER stress-mediated steatohepatitisinduced HCC [39]. However, additional studies are needed
to uncover the precise mechanism of the interaction
between ER stress and inflammation and the effects of
TUDCA on these signaling pathways.

DISCUSSION
There is an urgent need for innovative preventive
and therapeutic options for HCC [3]. Previous studies
have demonstrated that the chemical chaperone TUDCA
serves as a cytoprotective agent by reducing ER stress
and apoptosis [5, 7, 8, 14]. In this study, we evaluated
the preventive and therapeutic potential of TUDCA
and its effect on carcinogen-induced ER stress in HCC.
Our results reveal that TUDCA supplementation during
carcinogen exposure reduces the carcinogen-induced
apoptosis of hepatocytes and HCC incidence (Figure 7).
Furthermore, it does not stimulate the progression and
invasion of established tumors
A recent double-blind randomized trial demonstrated
that daily TUDCA therapy (750 mg) for 6 months is safe
and appears to be an effective liver cirrhosis treatment;
in particular, it improved several biochemical parameters
[31]. In addition, TUDCA therapy in cirrhotic patients
awaiting liver transplantation supported their functional
stability during the wait time [32]. Our results suggest that
TUDCA therapy in patients with a high HCC risk, such as
cirrhotic patients with continuous exposure to carcinogens,
not only improved liver function but could also prevent
HCC incidence.
We selected a low dosage (60 mg/kg/day), which
corresponds to dosages administrable and tolerable for
humans, and a high dosage (300 mg/kg/day) to assess
dose-dependent effects and potential side effects. Both
low- and high-dose TUDCA administration decreased

be an important factor in hepatocarcinogenesis [16, 40].
Apparently, increased hepatocyte apoptosis contributed
to the development of HCC in our DEN-induced mouse
model. TUDCA interrupts the positive feedback from UPRmediated apoptosis-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, leading to
UPR activation by tumor microenvironmental stresses [11].
Finally, an oral treatment option for preventing HCC
would be highly beneficial for cirrhotic patients with high
HCC risk. In this study, we showed that TUDCA could
represent a clinically applicable chemopreventive agent
for HCC. Whether hepatocyte susceptibility to other
carcinogens, such as viral replication or alcohol, can be
limited by chemical chaperones will be of great interest.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that
supplementation with TUDCA diminishes carcinogeninduced hepatotoxicity and prevents tumor induction by,
at least partially, alleviating positive feedback from ER
stress, inflammation and apoptosis in carcinogen-injured
liver tissue.

weeks of saline injections and regular drinking water. In
the therapeutic arm of the study, mice received DEN for
25 weeks before being treated with saline- or TUDCAsupplemented (low or high dose) drinking water for
5 weeks (n = 12 in each group). In addition, 30 μg of
tunicamycin was intraperitoneally injected in four naive
30-week-old male 129S2/SvPasCrl mice 72 h before
sacrifice. Blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus
under isoflurane anesthesia. After macroscopic evaluation
and quantification of hepatic tumor number, all organs
were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde
(Klinipath) and embedded in paraffin or snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Hematoxylin/eosin and reticulin staining
were performed to assess tumor burden, and the results
were evaluated by two independent observers. Sirius Red
staining enabled fibrosis assessment according to Metavir
scoring.Serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase
(ALT and AST, respectively) levels were measured at the
Lab of Clinical Biology, Ghent University Hospital.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Xenograft model

Animal studies

HepG2 cells (6×106) were re-suspended in 100 μl of
serum-free media and mixed with 100 μl of Matrigel(BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA). The cell preparation
was injected subcutaneously into the right flank of
8-week-old male athymic nude mice. Tumor volumes
were calculated using the following formula: volume
(mm3) = ab2/2; where b is the smaller dimension. When
the mean tumor volume reached 150 mm3, animals were
randomized into three groups (n = 6 in each group) as
follows: regular drinking water, low-dose (60 mg/kg/day)
TUDCA-supplemented drinking water and high-dose (300
mg/kg/day) TUDCA-supplemented drinking water. Tumor
dimensions were recorded two times per week with a
digital caliper starting on the first day of treatment. Tumor
weights were recorded at the time of sacrifice.

Ethics statement
The investigation was conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki as well as the national and international guidelines.
The investigation was also approved by the institutional
review board of Ghent University (ECD 11/52).
Orthotopic model
Wild-type 129S2/SvPasCrl mice were purchased
from Charles River (Belgium) and maintained as
previously described [18]. In the preventive arm of the
study, 5-week-old male mice were randomly divided into
4 groups (n = 12 in each group). Three groups received
weekly intraperitoneal DEN (35 mg/kg, in saline)
injections for 25 weeks with either regular drinking water
or drinking water supplemented with varying amounts
of TUDCA (low dose of 60 mg/kg/day or high dose of
300 mg/kg/day). Mice in the control group received 25

with tunicamycin (0.5 μg/ml), TUDCA (0.1–10 mM,
Calbiochem, MA, USA), salubrinal (50 μM, Tocris,
Bristol, UK), N-acetylcysteine (5 mM), H2O2 (1–5
mM) or equal volumes of solvent. For direct cell
counting, cells were trypsinised and counted in trypan
blue. All reagents were obtained from Sigma (Diegem,
Belgium) unless stated otherwise. Experiments were
performed in quadruplicate and independently repeated
three times.
