BACKGROUND: Patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) develop central nervous system (CNS) progression or recurrence during the course of their disease. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-NHL often develop CNS progression despite the use of prophylaxis. Liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) has shown activity in
lymphomatous meningitis, but there are limited data for prophylaxis. METHODS: Between May 2006 and December
2008, a phase 2 study of intrathecal liposomal cytarabine was performed at the dose of 50 mg in 30 patients with
HIV-NHL, with the aim of evaluating feasibility and activity for prophylaxis. RESULTS: Liposomal cytarabine was well
tolerated, with headache grade I to III being the most frequent side effect in 40% of patients. With a median followup of 10.5 months, only 1 (3%) patient developed a combined systemic and meningeal recurrence. The use of liposomal cytarabine allowed significant reduction of the number of lumbar injections in comparison to the standard schedules (around 50%), improving the quality of life of patients and reducing the professional exposure risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In this first study on prophylaxis of lymphomatous meningitis in HIV-NHL, liposomal cytarabine
seems safe and active; it reduces by approximately 50% the number of lumbar punctures, and exposure risk for

Involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is a relatively common clinical complication of aggressive nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that confers a poor prognosis. The incidence of leptomeningeal disease at diagnosis ranges
from 3.7% to 25%, and it is related to several factors, such as the different histological subtypes, the involvement of particular sites of disease (ie, testis, bone marrow, Waldeyer ring, or retroperitoneal masses), and an increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level.1-11 Moreover, the overall incidence of CNS recurrence with or without intrathecal prophylaxis
is around 5%.3,12-15
Since the beginning of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, a close association between
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and high-grade NHL has been reported. At onset, HIV-NHLs fall within
stages III and IV in >70% to 98% of cases with extranodal involvement, mainly the gastrointestinal tract, the bone marrow, and the CNS.16,17 The most common symptoms at diagnosis are fever, night sweats, and weight loss (75%).16-18
Typically HIV-NHLs are often bulky (nodal masses >10 cm in diameter), with a rapid growth rate and LDH levels well
above the normal range.16-19 The high rate of leptomeningeal disease at presentation, which may be asymptomatic, has
led to the widespread use of lumbar puncture for staging and the use of prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy for patients
considered to be at high risk of recurrence in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The incidence of CSF involvement at diagnosis

ranges from 3% to 15%, and it is related to Burkitt’s histology, extranodal involvement, and the use of highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).20-23 Considering
the high risk of progression during the treatment or recurrence during the remission, the use of intrathecal prophylaxis has been considered a mandatory part of the systemic
treatment of HIV-NHLs. However, despite the use of
standard treatment including methotrexate and/or cytarabine, the CNS recurrence remains a challenge in the outcome of these patients, with a recurrence rate of 4% to
5%.16,17,20 Recently, a liposomal formulation of cytarabine (DepoCyte) has shown similar activity of free cytarabine, with a lower toxicity profile and a more convenient
dosing regimen in the treatment of both lymphomatous
meningitis and meningitis from solid tumors.24-30 Up to
now, there are no data on the efficacy and safety of liposomal cytarabine in the prophylaxis of CSF recurrence or
progression in HIV-positive patients, although it has been
used in the therapeutic setting.31
With the aim of evaluating the feasibility and activity of liposomal cytarabine in the setting of prophylaxis in
HIV-related NHL, from May 2006 to December 2008
we started a phase 2 prospective study at the National
Cancer Institute in Aviano, Italy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria
Patients were enrolled into the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: biopsy-proven NHL according
to World Health Organization (WHO) classification,32
age >18 years, confirmed HIV infection, no previous
chemotherapy for lymphoma, and absence of lymphomatous cells by cytology in CSF. All patients signed informed
consent before entry into the study.
Staging
All patients were evaluated for history and physical examination, including height, weight, and WHO performance
status; measurement of all involved palpable lesions; complete blood cell count; blood chemistry; chest radiography, computer tomography of the head, thorax, and
abdomen; bone marrow aspiration and biopsy; electrocardiogram and left ventricular ejection fraction evaluation;
lumbar puncture with 3 mL of CSF analysis by cytology;
gastroscopy when indicated; CD4 cell count; and HIV viral load. Ann Arbor staging system was applied.33 The
presence of leptomeningeal disease was defined as the
presence of lymphomatous cells at cytology; a flow cytom-

etry was not allowed. All patients with a systemic recurrence or progression were reassessed for CNS recurrence.
Treatment
Liposomal cytarabine was administered at the standard dose
of 50 mg24-31 by lumbar sac injection on Day 1 of the systemic treatment. The use of intrathecal steroids was not
allowed. The systemic treatment plans were given according
to the ongoing protocols running at that time at our institution. Therefore, the liposomal cytarabine schedule was different according to the systemic chemotherapeutic regimens
used. Patients with CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) received CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin, prednisone) with rituximab
(R-CHOP)34 or rituximab plus infusional cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (R-CDE)35 every 3
weeks; patients with plasmablastic lymphoma or primary
effusion lymphoma (PEL) received the standard CHOP,36
and patients with Burkitt subtype received the rituximab
plus cyclophosphamide, oncovin, hydroxydaunomycin,
high-dose methotrexate, ifosphamide, etoposide, high-dose
cytarabine (R-CODOX-M/IVAC) regimen37 or the Stanford regimen for Burkitt.38
Liposomal cytarabine was administered every 3 weeks
in patients who received R-CHOP, CHOP, or R-CDE up
to 6 cycles and on Day 1 of R-CODOX-M up to 3 cycles
or on Day 1 of the Stanford regimen up to 6 cycles. Because
of some data showing an increased neurological toxicity
from the concomitant use of liposomal cytarabine and systemic high-dose cytarabine,39 we decided do not administered any prophylaxis during the R-IVAC regimen.
Patients who experienced a systemic progression of NHL
stopped the treatment with liposomal cytarabine, and did
not receive any prophylaxis during the salvage.
Supportive care included oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg) and fluconazole 100 mg
daily. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given
prophylactically (5 lg/kg/day) from Day 6 until neutrophil recovery. HAART was strongly recommended for all
patients participating in the trial.
Evaluation of Antitumor Response
and Toxicity
The response was evaluated according to Cheson’s criteria.40 Toxicity was rated according to WHO criteria.41
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint of the study was the CNS recurrence rate and the toxicity. The size for evaluation of the
impact of systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy was

assessed by Simon’s methods.42 Considering the optimal
2-stage design for phase 2, with a difference p1-p0 ¼ 20%
in terms of complete response (CR) rate between the
standard therapy (systemic chemotherapy plus intrathecal
methotrexate or cytarabine) (p0 ¼ 50%) and the new therapy (systemic chemotherapy plus liposomal cytarabine)
(p1 ¼ 70%), and fixing error probabilities (a ¼ .05 and
b ¼ .20), the number of patients was 30.
Overall survival (OS) was computed from the initiation of therapy until the last date the patient was known
to be alive, or death from any cause. Disease-free survival
(DFS) was calculated for patients who achieved a CR
from the first CR recorded until recurrence or the last
known date on which the patient was disease-free. OS and
DFS were evaluated according to Kaplan-Meier
method,43 and differences between subgroups were
assessed by means of the log-rank test.44 Differences
between qualitative parameters were performed by chisquare test and Fisher exact test. In all cases, statistical significant was claimed for P  .05 (2 sided).

RESULTS
From May 2006 to December 2008, 30 consecutive
patients with a diagnosis of HIV-NHL were enrolled into
the study. Twenty-five of 30 (83%) patients were men,
and 5 of 30 (17%) were women. Median age was 44 years
(range, 18-64 years), and the median performance status
(PS) was 1 (range, 0-3). As far as the risk group for HIV
infection, 11 of 30 (37%) were men who had sex with
men, 9 of 30 (30%) were intravenous drug users, 8 of 30
(27%) patients reported heterosexual contacts, 1 of 30
(3%) was transfused, and 1 of 30 (3%) denied any risk factor. Twelve of 30 (40%) patients have been receiving
HAART at the onset of NHL, with a median duration of
26 months (range, 17-113 months), and 2 of 30 (7%)
patients had a previous diagnosis of AIDS because of
opportunistic infections. The median CD4 cell count was
221/dL (range, 17-786/dL), and 21 of 30 (70%) patients
had a detectable HIV viral load, with a median value of
57.481 copies/dL (range, 87-550.000 copies/dL). Regarding histological subtypes, DLBCL was diagnosed in 15 of
30 (50%) of patients, Burkitt lymphoma in 11 of 30
(37%), plasmablastic lymphoma in 3 of 30 (10%), and
PEL in 1 of 30 (3%).
According to the Ann Arbor staging system, disease
staging was as follows: stage I in 4 of 30 (13%) patients,
stage II in 3 of 30 (10%), stage III in 6 of 30 (20%), and
stage IV in 17 of 30 (57%). Twelve of 30 (40%) patients
had bulky disease, whereas 13 of 30 (43%) had constituCancer

tional B symptoms. Twenty of 30 (67%) patients showed
extranodal involvement. In particular, the gastrointestinal
tract was involved in 8 of 30 (27%) patients, spleen in 6 of
30 (20%), bone marrow in 5 of 30 (17%), bone in 5 of 30
(17%), liver in 4 of 30 (13%), lung in 3 of 30 (10%), peritoneum 3 of 30 (10%), Waldeyer ring in 3 of 30 (10%),
soft tissue in 2 of 30 (7%), and skin in 2 of 30 (7%). Overall, serum LDH levels were higher than the normal upper
level in 20 of 30 (67%) patients, in particular in 9 of 11
(81%) patients with Burkitt NHL and in 11 of 19 (58%)
patients with other subtypes. As for the distribution of the
prognostic factors according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI),45 11 of 15 patients with DLBCL (73%)
had an age-adjusted IPI >1. No differences were found in
terms of CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, histological subtype, stage, PS, and anatomic site of involvement when we
compared those patients who were on HAART at the diagnosis of NHL versus those patients not on HAART.
The baseline characteristics of the patients are reported in

CDE in 2. HAART was used concomitantly with chemotherapy in all patients; in particular, 26 of 30 (87%) patients
received a protease inhibitor-based HAART (lopinavir/ritonavir in all patients but 1 who received fosamprenavir), and
the remaining 4 of 30 (13%) patients received a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based HAART
(efavirenz in 2 patients and nevirapine in 2 patients).
In December 2008, a total of 101 injections of liposomal cytarabine had been administered, with a median
number of 3 injections per patient (range, 1-7). The treatment was well tolerated. Thirteen of 30 (43%) patients
reported side effects after the administration of liposomal
cytarabine. In particular, headache was the most important side effect in 12 of 30 (40%) patients (grade 1 in 8
patients and grade 3 in 4 patients), with a median duration of 1 day, and in 4 patients headache was severe but
easily managed with aspirin or acetaminophen. The other
side effects included cortical changes in 2 of 30 (7%)
patients (1 patient developed grade 1 somnolence and 1
patient grade 1 agitation), grade 1 fever in 1 of 30 (3%),
grade 1 vomiting in 1 of 30 (3%), grade 1 hypertension in
1 of 30 (3%), and grade 1 chills in 1 of 30 (3%). The incidence of side effects was similar in patients treated with RCHOP/CHOP/R-CDE in comparison with those
patients who received an intensified regimen for Burkitt
NHL (ie, R-CODOX-M/IVAC or Stanford with rituximab). Interestingly, 57% of patients did not report any
side effect. Table 2 summarized the toxicity data. Up to
now, 14 patients have completed the planned cycles of liposomal cytarabine, 10 patients died of systemic lymphoma progression before completing the planned
treatment, 2 patients dropped out because of lymphoma
progression and toxicity of the systemic chemotherapy
regimen (R-CODOX-M/IVAC), 1 patient stopped the
treatment because of the onset of a pulmonary tuberculosis, 1 patient refused further treatment because of head-

1498

ache after the third injection of liposomal cytarabine, and
2 patients are still ongoing. With a median follow-up of
10.5 months (range, 1-32 months), only 1 (3%) patient
who received only 2 doses of liposomal cytarabine because
of R-CODOX-M/IVAC toxicity experienced both systemic and meningeal progression of Burkitt lymphoma after 12 months from the end of the prophylaxis. Twelve of
30 (40%) patients have died, 10 patients because of systemic NHL progression, 1 patient of cerebral toxoplasmosis while in CR for NHL, and 1 patient because of
systemic treatment toxicity. Of the remaining 18 patients,
2 patients are on therapy, and 16 patients are alive and in
CR, 3 of them after a rescue with second-line chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation.
Overall, 16 of 30 (53%) of patients achieved a CR,
6 of 30 (20%) a partial remission, and 8 of 30 (27%) progressed. Interestingly, only 4 of 16 (25%) patients who
achieved a CR experienced a systemic recurrence during
the follow-up. The 1-year OS and DFS are 74% and
100%, respectively.

DISCUSSION
This is the first study of liposomal cytarabine in the prophylaxis of lymphomatous meningitis in HIV-NHL. Liposomal cytarabine has been used only in the therapeutic
setting both for HIV31 and in the general population.24-30
In particular, the only study of the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis in 5 patients with HIV-NHL
showed a 60% CR rate.31 There is only limited experience
in the prophylactic setting in patients with aggressive lymphoma in the general population, whereas some data have
been published in patients with acute lymphocytic or myeloid leukemia.39,46,47

usually involves frequent lumbar punctures. Generally,
the use of direct intrathecal instillation of anticancer drugs
(ie, methotrexate or cytarabine) is 1 approach that has successfully been used in both the treatment and prevention
of leptomeningeal involvement to circumvent the pharmacologic sanctuary resulting from the blood-brain barrier. However, the use of methotrexate or cytarabine
necessitated frequent and prolonged courses of lumbar
punctures. Liposomal cytarabine, an encapsulated microvesicular liposome preparation, has shown significant activity in the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis, with
a significant pharmacokinetic advantage in comparison
with free cytarabine. A single injection of free cytarabine
maintains cytotoxic concentrations in CSF for <24
hours,48 whereas a single injection of 50 mg of liposomal
cytarabine maintains cytotoxic concentrations of cytarabine in CSF for >14 days, and the drug is well distributed
throughout the CSF.49,50
All patients included into the study were considered
at high risk of recurrence into the CNS because of underlying HIV infection, histology, elevated LDH, and
involvement of particular extranodal sites. The treatment
was well tolerated, and half of the patients did not report
any adverse event during the treatment. As expected, the
most frequent side effect was a transient headache that it
did not require any treatment in the majority of patients.
The incidence of headache in our study was similar to that
reported in all published studies of liposomal cytarabine
in the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis.24-30 The
other side effects were negligible. Up to now, with a median follow-up of 10.5 months, only 1 (3%) patient with

Burkitt lymphoma, who did not receive all the planned
injections, has developed disease recurrence in the CSF after 12 months from the end of the treatment. Interestingly, 14 patients completed the planned injections of
liposomal cytarabine, and with a median follow-up of 19
months (range, 6-32 months), no recurrences have been
observed. Our recurrence rate (3%) seems to be similar to
that reported in previous studies in both HIV-positive18,21 and HIV-negative patients with aggressive lymphomas.12 Moreover, in our experience previous to the
present study, we used methotrexate in 285 patients with
HIV-NHL with comparable side effects and a recurrence
rate of 10% (P ¼ .21).
Moreover, the improvement in the control of systemic NHL could contribute to reduce CNS progression.51 In our patients, the use of different regimens, in
particular R-CODOX-M/IVAC, that include high-dose
methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine may have influenced the positive outcome. Finally, the use of HAART
could play a key role in the reduction of CNS involvement, both because it allows the use of more intensive regimens and because it is able to prolong the DFS.16
However, the availability of a long-acting formulation of cytarabine in the prophylaxis setting allowed us to
change the schedule of injections especially in Burkitt subtype in comparison with the standard schedule. In the
standard R-CODOX-M regimen, 3 lumbar punctures
were scheduled (2 with free cytarabine on Days 1 and 3, 1
with methotrexate on Day 15), whereas we decided to
administer only 1 injection of liposomal cytarabine on
Day 1. Moreover, in the Stanford regimen for Burkitt, 2

1499

Original Article

lumbar punctures with methotrexate on Days 1 and 10
were scheduled. In the present study, we used 1 injection
of liposomal cytarabine only on Day 1. A similar reduction was found for R-IVAC, CHOP, and R-CHOP.
Moreover, comparing our schedule with that previously
used with methotrexate or cytarabine in the most
important published studies, a significant reduction of intrathecal injection occurred with comparable side
effects.19,21,34-38,52 These data are reported in Table 3.
This is an important matter both for patients and
physicians. Lumbar puncture is painful, and a significant
reduction of this procedure is generally associated with a
better quality of life for patients. Moreover, this procedure
presents a high risk to healthcare staff of HIV transmission; the risk of contact with patient’s CSF has been estimated at >20%, even if the risk of HIV transmission is
very low.53 Therefore, we think that the use of this drug
should be considered, especially in HIV setting.
In conclusion, our data demonstrated that liposomal
cytarabine is safe and active in the prevention of lymphomatous meningitis in HIV-NHL, even if more
patients and a longer follow-up are needed. However, taking into consideration that there are few data in the prophylactic use of liposomal cytarabine in patients with
lymphoma of the general population, that the HIV population is at higher risk of complications than the general
population, and that the systemic chemotherapeutic regimens are the exactly the same in both settings, our positive
conclusions could be translated into the general
population.
