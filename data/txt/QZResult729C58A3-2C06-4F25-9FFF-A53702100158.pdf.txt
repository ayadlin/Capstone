BACKGROUND: Changes in serum human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) levels associated with clinical
outcomes, including objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival have been reported
in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy. This study investigated
whether baseline or changes in serum HER2 correlated with overall response rate (ORR) and/or PFS in patients with
MBC receiving first-line lapatinib monotherapy. METHODS: The EGF20009 study investigated lapatinib monotherapy
in 138 HER2-positive patients with MBC previously untreated for their metastatic disease. Serum was collected and
assessed at baseline and every 4 weeks for 16 weeks after treatment initiation. Disease assessment was performed at
weeks 8 and 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter. A 20% decrease or increase in serum HER2 was defined as a significant change. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of patients had elevated baseline serum HER2. Baseline serum HER2
was associated with ORR (P ¼ .043) but not PFS. Patients with a 20% decrease from baseline of serum HER2 at
weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 had a significantly increased ORR and prolonged PFS. Conversely, those with a 20% increase
from baseline had a significantly lower ORR and shorter PFS. CONCLUSION: Significant decreases in serum HER2 levels during the first 16 weeks of lapatinib monotherapy were associated with better clinical outcome (longer PFS and

The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, ErbB2) proto-oncogene is a transmembrane receptor with an

extracellular domain (ECD) and intracellular tyrosine kinase activity.1,2 HER2 is overexpressed or amplified in approximately 20%-25% of invasive primary breast cancers as measured by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and it is associated with more aggressive disease.3,4 The HER2 ECD is cleaved by a disintegrin and
metalloprotease, and the remaining membrane-bound internal domain is constitutively activated.5 The ECD (p97-115
kDa) of the HER2 protein is released into the circulation, and serum HER2 levels are elevated in 30%-90% of patients
with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).6,7

Original Article

An elevated pretreatment serum HER2 level is associated with decreased response to both first-line and secondline endocrine therapy.8,9 Numerous studies have also
shown that changes in serum HER2 parallel the clinical
course of disease, with serum HER2 increasing with disease
progression and decreasing with treatment response.10-13
In an international multicenter analysis of data from 307
MBC patients treated with first-line trastuzumab-based
therapy, patients who achieved a >20% decrease in serum
HER2 from baseline had a significantly higher overall
response rate (ORR), longer time to progression (320 vs
180 days; P < .0001), longer duration of response (369 vs
230 days; P ¼ .008), and longer overall survival (898
vs 593 days; P < .018) compared with patients who did
not achieve a 20% decrease from baseline.14
Lapatinib (Tyverb, Glaxo Group Limited, Middlesex, United Kingdom; Tykerb in countries outside the
European Union) is a selective small-molecule dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets both human epidermal
growth factor receptors 1 and 2 (HER1 and HER2).
Unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib enters the cell and binds
reversibly to the cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate–
binding site in the kinase domains of the epidermal
growth factor receptor and HER2 receptors. This binding results in inhibition of receptor phosphorylation and
subsequent inhibition of downstream signaling cascade
through the ras/raf mitogen-activated protein kinase and
phosphoinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathways, leading to
decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. This
mechanism is distinct from that of trastuzumab, because
synergistic antitumor activity of lapatinib with trastuzumab, as well as activity in trastuzumab-resistant cell
lines, has been demonstrated.15 The combination of
lapatinib and capecitabine significantly decreased the
risk of disease progression relative to capecitabine alone
in women with HER2-positive advanced or MBC previously treated with anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab.16 Moreover, single-agent lapatinib activity as firstline treatment in HER2-positive MBC was reported
with an ORR of 24%.17 The purpose of this study was
to determine whether changes in serum HER2 are associated with clinical outcomes in HER2-positive MBC
patients receiving first-line lapatinib monotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
The EGF20009 study investigated lapatinib monotherapy in 138 HER2-positive patients with MBC who had

5014

not received trastuzumab previously.17 Amplification of
HER2 was documented by way of FISH in primary or
metastatic tumor tissues. Eligibility was determined via
local laboratory assessment. In addition, all samples were
centrally tested. Eligible patients were randomized to
receive either 1500 mg lapatinib once daily or 500 mg
lapatinib twice daily. Institutional review board approval
was obtained, and each patient or their guardian signed
informed consent. For the purpose of this biomarker analysis, patients who received either dose of lapatinib were
pooled, because there was no significant difference in
response between the 2 treatment groups. Where appropriate, these data conform to the REporting recommendations for tumor MARKer (REMARK) guidelines.18
Evaluation of Tumor Response and
Clinical Endpoints
Disease state was assessed at weeks 8 and 12 and every 12
weeks thereafter using Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) and was reviewed by a blinded
independent review committee. Progression-free survival
(PFS) was defined as the interval from the time of randomization until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. Confirmed ORR was
defined as the percentage of patients achieving either complete response or partial response.
Quantitation of the Serum HER2
Serum was collected every 4 weeks throughout the study.
Serum HER2 levels were assessed at baseline and every
4 weeks for 16 weeks after initiation of lapatinib monotherapy or until disease progression. Serum HER2 was available from 138 patients at screening, 131 patients at week 4,
109 patients at week 8, 83 patients at week 12, and 61
patients at week 16. Serum HER2 was quantified using a
commercially available test (Oncogene Science/WILEX,
Inc., Cambridge, MA), which has been cleared by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for follow-up and
monitoring of patients with MBC as described previously.19 A significant decline of serum HER2 was defined
as a decrease of 20% from baseline at the follow-up visit.
Similarly, a significant increase of serum HER2 was
defined as an increase of 20% from baseline at the follow-up visit. This definition of a significant change was
derived using the FDA-cleared cutoff, which is 2.5 times
the coefficient of variation of the HER2 assay.19 The 20%
serum HER2 decline had also been reported as the optimal
PFS cutoff obtained via receiver operating curve analysis of
302 patients treated with first-line trastuzumab-containing

therapy.14 Baseline serum HER2 levels above 15 ng/mL
were considered elevated.19
Statistical Analysis
The intent-to-treat population, comprising all women
who underwent randomization and received at least 1 day
of treatment, was used for the analyses. Results were correlated to PFS and ORR. This was an exploratory analysis
with all time points weighted equally. There were no
adjustments for multiple comparisons.
Baseline serum HER2 analysis

Patients were stratified into serum HER2–elevated
or serum HER2–normal groups according to their week 0
serum HER2 values relative to the normal cutoff of 15 ng/
mL. A log-rank test was used to compare PFS across serum HER2 strata. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to
compare the distribution of serum HER2 values for
patients stratified by ORR.
Change in serum HER2 analysis

The distribution of change from baseline serum HER2
values for patients stratified by ORR and by partial response,
stable disease, and progressive disease were compared using
the Kruskal–Wallis test at each time point. Change from
baseline was assessed by grouping patients who had 20%
change (increase or decrease) from baseline serum HER2 levels and comparing them with groups of patients who did not
achieve this change in serum HER2. For PFS, a log-rank test
was used to compare change from baseline serum HER2 values across these strata. For ORR, the percentage of patients
achieving response were compared using the Fisher exact
test. Kaplan–Meier curves were produced for PFS and median PFS were calculated from these curves.
Multivariate analysis

PFS was analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model to verify that the association
of changes in patients’ serum HER2 levels was not due to
baseline patient characteristics. Covariates assessed for the
Cox model were selected based on known clinical prognostic
factors, and availability in the database. The following 10
covariates were included in the model: 20% change in serum HER2 at any time during weeks 4-16, visceral disease at
baseline, number of sites of disease, stage of disease, bone
metastasis, lung metastasis, liver metastasis, time from diagnosis of metastatic disease to randomization, hormone receptor status, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status. Univariate proportional hazards models

were used to screen the covariates, and those significant at
P < .20 were included in a backward elimination multivariate Cox regression model according to a selection-stay criterion of P < .05. Baseline serum HER2 and baseline tumor
lesion size were forced into the multivariate model.
Effects were considered significant if P < .05, and
all P values were 2-sided. All analyses were conducted
using SAS version 9.2.

RESULTS
EGF20009: Patient Characteristics and
Clinical Activity
This was a retrospective analysis of serum samples from
138 patients with MBC who received first-line lapatinib
monotherapy and who had not received prior trastuzumab treatment. All patients had HER2 gene amplification
documented by FISH. The most common cause for lapatinib discontinuation was disease progression. In this
study, 33 patients achieved partial response and 71
patients had stable disease on lapatinib monotherapy.
Disease progression was reported in only 24 patients, and
10 patients were considered not evaluable.17
Baseline Serum HER2 and Clinical Outcomes
Of the 138 patients, 109 (79%) had a serum HER2 baseline
above the normal cutoff of 15 ng/mL. Higher baseline serum HER2 levels were associated with ORR (P ¼ .043) in
patients receiving lapatinib (Figure 1). However, baseline serum HER2 levels were not associated with PFS (P ¼ .87).
Changes in Serum HER2 Differ by
Clinical Outcome
Patients who achieved partial response while on lapatinib
monotherapy experienced statistically significant
decreases in median serum HER2 at weeks 4-16 compared with patients with stable disease or progressive disease (Figure 2). Patients with stable disease did not
experience any significant changes in serum HER2, and
patients whose disease progressed experienced an increase
in median serum HER2 (Figure 3).

In a predefined analysis, serum HER2 from all 138 MBC
patients was grouped according to the first week of significant decrease (20%) or the first week of significant
increase (20%) from baseline at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16
(Table 1). In 17 patients (12%), there was no significant
increase or decrease detected in serum HER2 levels during
the first 16 weeks. However, 64 (46%) of the 138 patients

(66%) of these 64 patients had a significant increase in serum HER2 by week 4. By week 12, 61 (95%) of the 64
patients had a significant cumulative increase in serum
HER2 of 20%. For the majority of patients, once they
achieved a 20% decrease in their serum HER2, the level
did not increase within the 16 weeks, illustrating that the
change in serum HER2 is stable throughout the 16 weeks
of treatment. Only 6.3% (4/64) of patients experienced a
serum HER2 increase following an initial decrease,
whereas only 4.7% (3/64) who had an initial increase had
a subsequent decline over the first 16 weeks of treatment.
Association of Response Rate by 20% Decline
or Increase in Serum HER2
The change in serum HER2 from baseline and its association with ORR was then evaluated. For patients achieving
a 20% decline in serum HER2 (baseline to week 4), the
ORR was significantly higher (24/52 ¼ 46%) compared
with those who did not have this decrease (9/73 ¼
12.3%) (P < .0001). This effect of significant association
between a 20% decline in serum HER2 and ORR was
also observed at weeks 8, 12, and 16 (data not shown).
Conversely, for patients who experienced a 20%
increase in serum HER2 (baseline to week 4), the ORR
was significantly lower (1/39 ¼ 2.6%) compared with
those who did not have this increase (32/86 ¼ 37%) (P <
.0001). This effect of significant association between a
20% increase in serum HER2 and ORR was also
observed at weeks 8, 12, and 16 (Table 2).
Association of PFS by 20% Decline or
Increase in Serum HER2
Patients who achieved a 20% decrease from baseline of
serum HER2 at week 4 had a significantly longer median
PFS of 28.4 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI],
20.7-36.1; n ¼ 53) compared with 19.3 weeks (95% CI,

Patients who experienced a 20% increase from

n ¼ 89) for patients who did not have the increase (P <

weeks 8 and 16 from baseline also had a significantly
shorter PFS. Patients experiencing a 20% increase at
week 8 from baseline had a significantly shorter PFS (median PFS of 16.2 weeks [95% CI, 11.7-20.1; n ¼ 41])
compared with 28.4 weeks (95% CI, 20.7-36.2; n ¼ 68)
for those who did not experience the increase (P ¼

disease to randomization, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. In addition, baseline
serum HER2 and baseline tumor size were forced into the

analysis to maximize the number of patients included in

The results revealed that only the change in serum
HER2 (20% decrease in serum HER2 vs <20%
decrease) and baseline tumor size were significant independent covariates for PFS (Table 3).
In addition, an exploratory analysis was conducted
using serum HER2 change as a continuous variable (eg,
maximum percent change in ECD from baseline). The
continuous ECD change results were consistent with the
categorical ECD change results using the 20% cutoff:

hazard of progression, and decreases in serum ECD were
associated with decreased hazard of progression.

DISCUSSION
Baseline (pretreatment) serum HER2 as well as serial
changes in serum HER2 up to 16 weeks postbaseline in
138 MBC patients treated with lapatinib monotherapy
were investigated. All 138 women were HER2-positive by
gene amplification FISH assay. Of the 138 patients in the
study, 79% had elevated (>15 ng/mL) serum HER2 at
baseline. Elevated serum HER2 at baseline (>15 ng/mL)
was not associated with PFS while on lapatinib monotherapy, but was significantly correlated with ORR.
The serial change in serum HER2 from baseline was
significantly associated with both patient response and
PFS. A 20% decrease of serum HER2 from baseline to
as early as 4 weeks was associated with prolonged PFS and
higher ORR in patients receiving lapatinib monotherapy.
This finding was confirmed at weeks 8, 12, and 16. Serum
HER2 changes were generally consistent (ie, if the serum
HER2 level declined, it generally remained decreased).
However, due to limited serum HER2 data for time
points beyond week 16, the stability of changes in serum
HER2 cannot be assessed beyond the 16-week period. In
general, the change in serum HER2 occurred early,
because 74% of patients exhibited a significant change by
week 4, and 93% by week 8.
This is the first study monitoring serum HER2 in
MBC patients treated with lapatinib monotherapy and
correlating serum HER2 with clinical outcome. Our
results are consistent with previous reports measuring serum HER2 in trastuzumab-treated patients. Esteva et al20
showed that changes in serum HER2 levels from baseline
predicted PFS in patients undergoing trastuzumab-based
therapy for MBC; their report suggested that a rising serum HER2 may be detected sooner than clinical symptoms or radiologic progression. Kostler et al12 also
reported that significant changes from baseline of serum
HER2 predicted PFS, and that the change in serum
HER2 preceded the clinical course of disease in trastuzumab-treated patients. In the largest study to date (307
patients with MBC), Ali et al14 reported that a 20%
decrease of serum HER2 from baseline in the early weeks
following therapy initiation predicted for significantly
increased objective response rate, prolonged time to progression, and longer survival to first-line trastuzumab
therapy. Similar results were obtained by other
investigators.21

In conclusion, in this study baseline serum HER2
was not associated with PFS, but was with ORR. This
result is similar to that of other recent large reports concluding that baseline serum HER2 did not predict
response to trastuzumab22 or lapatinib therapy.23 However, in this study a 20% decrease from baseline in serum
HER2 was associated with an increased response rate and
prolonged PFS to lapatinib monotherapy. A significant
decline (or increase) in serum HER2 levels as early as
4 weeks after the start of lapatinib therapy was correlated
with response to therapy. Therefore, early changes in serum HER2 could be useful in monitoring clinical outcome in HER2-positive MBC patients receiving lapatinib
monotherapy. For patients not achieving a 20% decrease
from baseline in serum HER2, novel agents such as a disintegrin and metalloprotease sheddase inhibitor, which
has been shown to enhance the antitumor effect of lapatinib in vitro,24 or other novel agents could be evaluated in
clinical trials for the potential to improve patient
response.25
