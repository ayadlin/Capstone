BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify subgroups of patients with castrate-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) who had a prolonged response to combined dexamethasone and diethylstilbestrol (DS) therapy by
constructing a prognostic index. METHODS: Multivariate and cutoff point analyses with bootstrapping were performed 1 month after commencing DS therapy, and data were validated using an independent external dataset.
RESULTS: The median overall survival for 145 patients was 18.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.4-23.3
months). Only 2 factors were significant on multivariate analysis: a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level below the
median at the start of DS therapy and a decline >50% in the PSA level after 1 month on DS therapy. Subsequent cutoff point analyses revealed that a PSA level <88 ng/mL at the start of DS therapy and a reduction >53.1% in PSA after
the first month of treatment were the most significant factors. These 2 factors were used to construct a prognostic
index, which was validated successfully by the external dataset (median overall survival, 18.3 months [95% CI, 16.428.0 months]; concordance, 72% [95% CI, 68%-76%]). The prognostic index identified 3 prognostic groups: The
2-year overall survival rate for these 3 groups was 68% (95% CI, 57%-98%) for the good prognostic group, 40% (95%
CI, 31%-52%) for the intermediate prognostic group, and 12% (95% CI, 5%-25%) for the poor prognostic group.
CONCLUSIONS: The easy-to-use prognostic index that the authors developed was able to identify a subgroup of
patients with CRPC who had prolonged survival only 1 month after starting DS therapy. Cancer 2010;116;3595–602.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United Kingdom.1 The incidence of the disease is

increasing, and it is responsible for greater than 10,000 deaths per annum.2 Hormone therapy targeting testosterone and
its receptor is standard treatment for patients who have locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. It is associated with
response rates in excess of 90%, and it is possible to predict the long-term survival of patients from the initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to this therapy.3
The development of resistance to this initial hormone treatment occurs over time2 and heralds a new phase of the
disease known as castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is associated with a poor prognosis. Docetaxel chemotherapy is associated with a modest survival benefit in unselected patients in this setting.4 Predicting which patients with
CRPC will benefit from chemotherapy has proved elusive, in that a reduction in the PSA level does not appear to correlate
with outcome, especially in the first 3 months of treatment.5 Indeed, the PSA level may even rise after the initiation of

chemotherapy.5-7 This has led some investigators to drop
PSA as a surrogate marker in some chemotherapy studies
of patients with CRPC.8 Moreover, this cytotoxic is not
necessarily applicable to all patients, such as those who are
too frail or those who have an asymptomatic, rising PSA,
for whom deferring chemotherapy may be preferred and
further hormone manipulation may be an attractive alternative. Therefore, recently, there has been renewed interest in investigating further hormone-targeted therapy in
patients with CRPC.
It is not known whether PSA response is a useful surrogate marker for survival when patients with CRPC
receive further hormone therapy. Therefore, we studied the
relation between PSA and long-term survival in patients
with CRPC who received further hormone-targeted therapy (combined dexamethasone and diethylstilbestrol
[DS]). It is known that both dexamethasone and diethylstilbestrol produce responses in patients with CRPC, and
they are established treatments at our institutions. Both
agents are licensed and have been used widely to treat
CRPC in the United Kingdom and in much of Europe.9
An important question is to establish whether it is
possible to identify a subgroup of selected individuals
with CRPC who potentially would benefit from further
hormone therapy and, thus, would have a viable option to
defer chemotherapy. In the current study, we attempted
to do this by measuring PSA levels before and 1 month after the start of DS therapy to investigate its prognostic
significance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
At our institution, data on all prostate cancer patients are
collected in a computerized, prospective database by the
Medical Oncology Department. Subsequent data analysis
has been reviewed and approved by the appropriate local
ethics committee. Between 1999 and 2007, it was the policy at our institution to offer DS therapy (dexamethasone
2 mg and diethylstilbestrol 1 mg; both given orally once
daily) to castrate patients with CRPC who had either a rising PSA >20 ng/mL or a rising PSA plus symptomatic
progression before chemotherapy. DS therapy was offered
to all patients (in combination with aspirin and a proton
pump inhibitor) after they had failed on initial hormone
therapy for hormone-sensitive disease. Initial hormone
therapy consisted of either maximum androgen blockage
(MAB) followed by antiandrogen withdrawal (91%) or
MAB with no subsequent androgen withdrawal (9%).
The antiandrogen that was used was either bicalutamide

3596

(86%) or flutamide (14%). This withdrawal of antiandrogen is associated with only modest benefits10 and, in
Europe, is not necessarily considered to be definitive second-line hormone therapy, unlike DS. For the current
study, all patients provided informed consent before starting treatment.
Prognostic patient factors were assessed 30 days
(7 days) after the start of DS therapy rather than at the
start of DS therapy. This type of analysis has been performed previously by others with success in patients with
hormone-sensitive prostate cancer3; and, in the current
study, it allowed us to investigate whether changes in PSA
had prognostic value. We performed an initial univariate
analysis and a subsequent multivariate analysis at this time
point. For the univariate analysis, we included similar factors
that were identified as significant in a previously published,
well known prognostic index for CRPC that was used to
investigate pretreatment factors.11 These included Gleason
score, initial PSA before MAB, nadir PSA on first-line hormone therapy, age, hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, presence of bone metastasis, time on lutenizing hormonereleasing hormone analogs, PSA at the time of DS therapy,
and PSA decline after 1 month on DS therapy. The sample
size had to be large enough to calculate a population prevalence with a given amount of confidence (ie, 95%) in the
measurement of different percentiles of outcome.
To facilitate ease of use, the prognostic index was
designed to range from 0 and to increase in whole-number
increments to 1 and then 2, with each integer representing
a constant proportionate increase in risk. To accomplish
this, the index was based on the hazard ratio (HR) for
each prognostic factor in the final model. First, these were
transformed into whole-number increments by dividing
each by the smallest HR and rounding the resulting ratios
to the nearest integer. This naturally led to a logarithmic
scale in which the whole numbers could be added or subtracted to reflect changes in proportionate risk. Calibration was used to measure the difference between the
observed and predicted probability of survival.
Curves for the overall duration of survival were plotted by using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank
method was used to test for the significance of differences
in survival distributions, and univariate Cox proportional
hazards regression was used to identify the covariates of
possible prognostic significance.
Representation of continuous variables by categorical variables can lead to the loss of information and to
over fitting. Accordingly, we took steps to ensure the validity of the categorical variables, as we described

previously.12-14 First, cutoff points were chosen according
to previous clinical considerations without specific reference to the data. Second, the variables were plotted as
nonlinear covariates in a univariate Cox regression using
natural splines. The resulting curves revealed some evidence of a change in hazard and did not rule out the possibility of using a categorical variable. Third, cutoff point
analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff points
for each covariate. Because the determination of a cutoff
point might be unstable with respect to perturbations of
the data, this analysis was confirmed using nonparametric
bootstrapping: We took 2000 samples from the original
primary data distribution by random resampling with
replacement and repeated the cutoff point analysis. Validity of the proportional hazards assumption was tested by
checking for correlations between time and the scaled
Schoenfeld residuals of each covariate. With these data,
we went on to construct a prognostic index, which was dependent on the number of prognostic factors present.
External validation was performed using a larger
dataset, which consisted of 192 patients who were treated
in the same manner between 1998 and 2007 across a total
of 4 hospitals in the United Kingdom. DS therapy was the
standard of care in these institutions. These hospitals
included 1) Whipps Cross Hospital, 2) Princess Royal
Hospital, 3) University College London, and 4) The
Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. All of these hospitals
used the same regimen as first-line therapy in patients
with CRPC, and all patients were enrolled in a similar
manner. Exclusion criteria followed a pattern similar to
that used to exclude individuals who had a history thromboembolic disease. Once again, the PSA level before treatment and after 30 days of treatment (within 7 days) was
recorded in all patients along with overall survival. The
prognostic index was calculated for each individual
patient and the c statistic (a discriminating measure of
concordance between observed and expected survival
analogous to the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve) was calculated for the prognostic score in the
primary and validation sets. Validation of the c statistic
was carried out by a similar bootstrap procedure using
resampled data comprising 2000 iterations of the dataset,
which also derived the 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Cox multivariate modeling was used again to identify independent variables that were predictive of survival. Backward variable selection based on the Bayes Information
Criterion and allowing up to 2-way interactions between
variables was used to produce the final multivariate
model. Thus, the validity of the HR and CI obtained in

Cancer

the multivariate Cox analysis was confirmed by nonparametric bootstrapping with replacement. Robust estimates
of the HR and standard errors together with CIs were
recalculated from these bootstrap statistics, as we
described previously.12-14

RESULTS
In total, we identified 172 individuals with CRPC and, of
these, 145 consecutive individuals (84%) who had biopsy-proven (adenocarcinoma), locally advanced, or metastatic CRPC received DS therapy and were used to
construct a prognostic index. The median age of these
individuals was 73 years (age range, 50-90 years) (Table 1),
70% had metastatic disease at the time of DS therapy, and
the median overall survival from the start of DS therapy
was 18.3 months (95% CI, 15.4-23.3 months) (Fig. 1A).
Before DS therapy, all patients initially either received gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (98%)
or underwent bilateral orchidectomy (2%). Orchidectomy was chosen either by the patient or if GnRH analog
therapy was deemed inappropriate. None of the patients
had received any previous therapy for CRPC, such as
chemotherapy.
The remaining 27 potentially eligible patients
(16%) did not receive DS therapy because of contraindications, such as a history of thromboembolic disease
(Table 2). Other treatments (instead of DS) for these
patients included single-agent, second-line hormone
therapy (n ¼ 20) or chemotherapy (n ¼ 3). The median
overall survival for this group was 15.3 months (95% CI,
6.7-31.2 months).
By using our primary dataset derived from 145 individuals with CRPC who received DS therapy (n ¼ 145),
we observed that only 2 factors were significant in multivariate analysis (Table 3). These were a PSA level below
the median at the time of starting DS therapy and a
decline in PSA by 50% after 30 days of treatment (P <
.001 for both).
Subsequent cutoff point analysis revealed that a PSA
of 88 ng/mL at the start of DS therapy and a reduction in
PSA by 53.1% after 30 days of therapy were the most significant variables in the derivation dataset (Fig. 1B,C).
These cutoff points were extremely close to those that
were chosen using only previous clinical considerations (a
PSA value above or below the median value at the start of
DS therapy [ie, 82.5 ng/mL] and a 50% reduction in
PSA), thereby justifying the choice of cutoff point for

these categorical variables. Bootstrapping techniques were
used to successfully internally validate these data.
In the final multivariate model, an initial PSA value
below the median produced an HR of 0.464 (95% CI,
0.292-0.739), and a PSA reduction >50% produced an
HR of 0.391 (95% CI, 0.242-0.632). The prognostic
index was created by scaling the 2 HRs to integers, such
that 1 point was given for an initial PSA value above the
median, and 1 point was given for a PSA reduction
<50%.
This resulted in a scale from 0 to 2, with a score of 0
representing the best prognostic group and a score of 2
representing the worst prognostic group. Cox regression
of the prognostic index demonstrated an HR of 0.427
(95% CI, 0.314-0.582), and increasing the prognostic
score by 1 point resulted in a reduction in risk to 42.7%
of the risk of the lower score.

This prognostic index resulted in 3 groups: a good
prognostic group (0 points: n ¼ 40 patients; 28%), an intermediate prognostic group (1 point: n ¼ 58 patients;
40%), and a poor prognostic group (2 points: n ¼ 47
patients; 32%). The 2-year overall survival rates for these
3 groups were 68% (95% CI, 57%-98%), 40% (95% CI,
31%-52%), and 12% (95% CI, 5%-25%), respectively
(Fig. 1D). The characteristics of patients in the 3 prognostic groups are described in Table 1, and the prognostic
scores for patients at risk over time are listed in Table 2.
Next, we analyzed the external validation dataset
(n ¼ 192). The baseline characteristics of the patients in
the primary and validation cohorts did not differ significantly (Table 2). The median overall survival for patients
in this dataset was 18.3 months (95%CI, 16.4-28.0

particularly reliable because 142 of these individuals died,

cancer.

Data were missing for 55 (28%) of these patients, although the data required to calculate the prognostic score (PSA at the start of DS and after 30 days of

d
Gleason scores were obtained both from biopsies and from prostatcectomies.

Sixteen patients (11%) developed thromboembolic events
and continued on DS after commencing anticoagulation
with low-molecular-weight heparin according to institutional protocol. These toxic or embolic events did not
occur more frequently in any of the 3 prognostic groups
(P > .05).

DISCUSSION
The prognostic index that we developed demonstrated
that it is possible to identify a subgroup of patients (28%)
with CRPC who have a comparatively good prognosis
within 1 month (30 days) of commencing DS therapy.
Although DS therapy appears to have impressive efficacy
in these patients, it should not be considered as an alternative to docetaxel in the absence of prospective randomized
studies. However, the finding is noteworthy to patients
for whom the routine use docetaxel is not feasible for clinical reasons or is not available because of healthcare economic reasons.
Our focus on overall survival is consistent with
recently published data confirming this as the most valid

3600

endpoint.15 This includes recent US Food and Drug
Administration briefing documents on the use of new
drugs in this setting16 in which the time to progression
was deemed an unreliable parameter.17 The overall survival in this cohort of >18 months is in line with data
from the randomized studies in this area,3 although this
was a heterogeneous population, and direct comparisons
were not possible.
The prolonged survival of selected patients in the
good prognostic group was not related simply to the identification of individuals with less aggressive tumors at the
time of initial diagnosis, because the initial PSA at diagnosis, Gleason grade, and duration on GnRH therapy were
not prognostically significant in either univariate or multivariate analysis in our dataset. This suggests that factors
beyond ‘‘aggressive disease,’’ such as the development of
tumor clones sensitive to further hormone manipulation,
may be important in determining response.
One of the most important side effects that occurred
in the current study was thromboembolic events (11%).
This should be considered before patients start the regimen.

This factor subsequently was identified as significant on both multivariate analysis and univariate analysis. Results of
the multivariate model identified only 2 factors that were significant: a decline >50% in PSA (P ¼ .0001) and PSA below
the median (P ¼ .0002).

Our work suggests that specific PSA levels before
and 1 month after the initiation of DS therapy can identify which patients with CRPC will have good outcomes.
This is not the case with chemotherapy in this setting, in
which early PSA changes are not useful.5 To our knowledge, this is the first time this distinction has been made,
and it is relevant clinically because it allows nonresponders
to stop DS therapy and start chemotherapy before the
symptomatic progression of disease. In addition, it suggests that earlier intervention with therapy may be important in this setting in terms of survival. This is an
important message for urologists and primary healthcare

physicians as well as oncologists who are involved in the
management of these patients. This prognostic index
applies to both metastatic and locally advanced CRPC
and includes symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Although it does not appear that poor-risk patients benefit
from DS therapy, there is a case for its use in the other 2
risk groups when docetaxel is not deemed appropriate.
Unfortunately, in the absence of randomized studies, it is not possible to determine whether this prognostic
index is predictive of a response to DS therapy or is purely
prognostic. In other words, it is possible that patients in
the good prognosis group are at an earlier stage in the

natural history of their disease and, thus, have a longer
survival. Other limitations include the fact that this study
was carried out before the widespread use of docetaxel
chemotherapy, and only a small proportion of patients in
the study received this treatment (7%). Because of the
small numbers, it is not possible to obtain meaningful
data on whether this had an impact on survival or whether
the prognostic index applied to the patients who received
docetaxel.
Furthermore, a significant proportion of patients
(28%) did not have data available on their Gleason score,
and this should be considered when interpreting the
results (Tables 1 and 2). A final shortcoming was that the
work was retrospective and took place over several years,
which may lead to bias. Despite these issues, the high concordance of the large external dataset, in which 74% have
died (with a median follow-up >3 years), suggests that
the prognostic index is clinically useful.
The major toxicity associated with DS therapy in
this series, as expected, was the development of thromboembolic events in 11% of patients despite the routine
use of aspirin. This was not associated with excess mortality; however, it is a consideration when using DS therapy.
The prognostic index described here, with only 3
scores, is simple to use and relies on only 2 separate PSA
measurements taken 1 month apart. It is of particular importance when docetaxel therapy is not considered possible or appropriate therapy. Indeed, this approach appears
to be attractive in the good-risk group and requires further
evaluation.
