ABSTRACT
Chemokines and chemokine receptors have critical roles in cancer metastasis
and have emerged as one of the targeting options in cancer therapy. However, the
treatment efficacy on both tumor and host compartments needs to be carefully
evaluated. Here we report that targeting CXCR3 decreased tumor cell migration and
at the same time improved host anti-tumor immunity. We observed an increased
expression of CXCR3 in metastatic tumor cells compared to those from non-metastatic
tumor cells. Knockdown (KD) of CXCR3 in metastatic tumor cells suppressed tumor
cell migration and metastasis. Importantly, CXCR3 expression in clinical breast cancer
samples correlated with progression and metastasis. For the host compartment,
deletion of CXCR3 in all host cells in 4T1 mammary tumor model significantly decreased
metastasis. The underlying mechanisms involve a decreased expression of IL-4, IL-10,
iNOs, and Arg-1 in myeloid cells and an increased T cell response. IFN-γ neutralization
diminished the metastasis inhibition in the CXCR3 knockout (KO) mice bearing 4T1
tumors, suggesting a critical role of host CXCR3 in immune suppression. Consistently,
targeting CXCR3 using a small molecular inhibitor (AMG487) significantly suppressed
metastasis and improved host anti-tumor immunity. Our findings demonstrate that
targeting CXCR3 is effective in both tumor and host compartments, and suggest that
CXCR3 inhibition is likely to avoid adverse effects on host cells.

INTRODUCTION

paramount in tumor escape from host immune surveillance,
which includes compromised function of antigen
presenting cells, NK cells, B, and T lymphocytes [5–7].
Despite our recognition of the devastating consequences of
metastasis, we have not been able to treat cancer metastasis
effectively [8]. One major challenge is the selection of
therapy that can not only target cancer cells efficiently,
but also avoid an adverse effect on the host compartment

Metastasis of epithelial tumor cells critically depends
on acquisition of a disseminating phenotype that allows
tumor cells to migrate, invade, and colonize in distant
organs. In addition, the metastatic process also requires the
participation of a host compartment [1–4]. Further, systemic
suppression of both innate and adoptive immune cells is also

and preferably improve host anti-tumor immunity.
Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying both tumor and host compartments during the
metastatic process is critical for cancer therapy to be more
effective and less toxic.
One of the molecular mechanisms involves
chemokines/chemokine receptors [9, 10]. The chemokine
receptors are a family of 18 to 22 G-protein–coupled
receptors whose expressions and functions have been
noticed in a number of malignancies [11]. There is clear
implication of chemokine receptors in breast cancer
metastasis [12, 13]. CXCR3 has been reported to have a
metastasis-promoting function in breast cancer [14–16],
colon cancer [17–19], and osteosarcoma [20], as well
as lung cancer [21]. CXCR3-targeted therapy has been
proposed as a treatment option. However, its molecular
mechanisms of function and therapeutic application
potentials, especially on the host, remain to be investigated.
Here we report that CXCR3 KD in tumor cells inhibited
tumor cell migration and metastasis. Deletion of CXCR3
in host cells using CXCR3 KO mice showed a decreased
metastasis and improved host anti-tumor immunity.
Treating tumor-bearing mice with a CXCR3 inhibitor
(AMG487) that targets both tumor and host compartments
decreased tumor metastasis and simultaneously improved
host immune responses. Our study, using both genetic and
chemical approaches, demonstrates that CXCR3 inhibition
could inhibit tumor cell metastatic capability and, at the
same time, improve host anti-tumor immunity. Our data
suggest that CXCR3 inhibition, unlike most chemotherapy
agents, should prevent adverse or toxic effect on host cells.

It is well known that tumor microenvironment
is an indispensible participant in tumor metastasis. To
examine whether the tumor microenvironment has an
effect on CXCR3 expression, we next examined CXCR3
expression level in tumor cells from primary tumor tissues
compared to those in culture. The tumor cells derived from
the tumor tissues had significantly higher expression of
CXCR3 compared the tumor cells in culture when the
same non-enzymatic dissociation procedure was applied
to the preparation of the single cell suspension for flow
cytometry analysis (Figure 1C). This observation was
also made in the B16F10 melanoma mouse model
(Supplementary Figure 1). Together these data suggest
that CXCR3 is likely important in tumor metastasis
and its expression is likely up-regulated by the tumor
microenvironment.

CXCR3 knockdown in tumor cells significantly
decreased 4T1 metastasis as well as tumor cell
migration and mobility
To understand the function of CXCR3 in breast
cancer metastasis, we knocked down (KD) CXCR3 in 4T1
cells using shRNA (Figure 2A). We then injected these
cells into the tail vein of syngeneic Balb/c mice. Mice
bearing 4T1 CXCR3 KD cells had significantly reduced
lung metastasis compared to the controls (Figure 2B),
suggesting CXCR3 plays a critical role in promoting
tumor metastasis.
We next investigated the mechanisms that are
responsible for CXCR3’s role in metastasis. Using
immunofluorescence staining of the tumor tissues, we
initially observed a higher level of CXCR3 at the invading
edge of the tumors (Figure 3A). This observation led us
to hypothesize that CXCR3 promotes tumor cell invasion
and migration, critical steps in the metastatic cascade. We
thus performed a Transwell migration assay in which the
4T1 tumor cells, with or without CXCR3 KD, were tested
for their migratory capability. CXCR3 KD diminished the
4T1 cell migration (Figure 3B). To further examine this,
we conducted a scratch or wound healing in vitro assay
using IncuCyte (Essen BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI), which
allowed us to monitor cell migration and wound closure
in real time by taking a series of pictures over a specified
period. As expected, the 4T1 cells showed better migration
and wound closure than the non-metastatic 4T07 and
67NR cells (Figure 3C). Interestingly and consistently,
CXCR3 KD decreased the migration and wound closure of
4T1 cells (Figure 3C, left panel for representative figures
and right panel for time course studies). CXCR3 KD
also changed the morphology of 4T1 cells in culture
(Supplementary Figure 2). Together, these data suggest
that CXCR3-mediated signals likely promote tumor cell
migration and mobility, and contribute to metastasis.

RESULTS
CXCR3 expression was increased in the
metastatic mammary tumor cells
CXCR3 has been reported to play a role in tumor
progression and metastasis in a number of cancers
[21]. To investigate the role of CXCR3 in breast cancer
metastasis, we used the 4T1 mammary tumor model, which
shares many characteristics with human breast cancer,
particularly its ability to spontaneously metastasize to the
lungs. The 4T1 model also has three additional cell lines
derived from the same tumor but with different degrees of
malignancy― 4T1 being the most malignant, then 4T07,
168FARN, and 67NR (the least malignant). To examine
whether there is correlation between CXCR3 expression
and metastatic ability, we first performed Q-PCR to compare
the expression of CXCR3 in these cell lines. Interestingly,
CXCR3 expression was the highest in 4T1 cells, second
highest in 4T07, then much lower in 168 FARN or 67NR
(Figure 1A). The results were further validated with
immunofluorescence staining of CXCR3 in cultured 4T1,
4T07, 168FARN, and 67NR cells (Figure 1B). These data
suggest a correlation of CXCR3 level with the degree of the
malignancy in cultured cell lines.

Correlation of CXCR3 with human breast
cancer progression and metastasis

used the average of CXCR3 expression in all patients as
a cut-off; the results above the average were categorized
as the CXCR3 high group whereas the results below
the average were categorized as the CXCR3 low group.
CXCR3 level correlated with tumor grades (Figure 4B).
Grade 3 tumors showed significantly higher CXCR3 level
than grade 1 or grade 2 (Figure 4B). Furthermore, CXCR3
was differentially expressed in ER- and ER + breast
cancer patients (GSE22220). ER- patients, who often
have a worse prognosis than that of the ER + patients,
showed a significantly higher level of CXCR3 than
ER + patients (Figure 4C). The CXCR3 expression
level was clearly higher in the basal cancer types than
in the luminal types in 10 human breast cancer cell lines
examined using flow cytometry analysis (Figure 4D).

To understand the clinical relevance of our
mouse studies, we investigated the possible correlation
between CXCR3 expression with human breast cancer
progression. First we utilized Kaplan-Meier Plotter
to evaluate the prognostic utility of 22,277 genes in
1,809 breast cancer patients [22]. The higher CXCR3
expression level correlated with a poor distant metastasis
free survival (DMFS) of patients with ER + tumors
treated by Tamoxifen (Figure 4A). Next we examined the
correlation of CXCR3 with other clinical-pathological
characteristics in the publicly available database
GSE22220 [23] using GeneSpring GX 10.0 software. We

expression correlates with breast cancer progression in a
clinical setting, and indicate that anti-CXCR3 treatment
could provide options for metastasis treatment of breast
cancer.

with no effect on the primary tumor size (Figure 5A, right
panel). Further, CXCR3 was expressed in most of the
host immune cells including Gr-1 + CD11b + immature
myeloid cells, F4/80 macrophages, B cells, CD4, and
CD8 T cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). These data
indicate that signals mediated through CXCR3 may affect
host immune responses. Indeed, the percentages of the
CD3 +, CD3 + CD4 +, and CD3 + CD8 + cells in the
spleen of CXCR3 KO mice were significantly higher
than those in the wild type control mice (Figure 5B).
Additionally, myeloid cells sorted from CXCR3 KO mice
showed reduced expressions of IL4 and IL10, as well as
iNOS and arginase1 (Figure 5C). These data suggest that
CXCR3 deletion could direct the myeloid cells into more
of a type 1 phenotype, thus stimulating host anti-tumor
immunity. Interestingly, we observed a correlation of
CXCR3 level with TβRII expression (Figure 5D) in
myeloid cells that we previously reported play a critical
role in breast cancer metastasis and host immune
suppression [24]. KD of TβRII in RAW264.7 macrophages

Host CXCR3 promotes 4T1 lung metastasis and
immune suppression
Many therapeutic drugs developed to target cancer
cells often show adverse effects on host cells. To examine
the possible effect of anti-CXCR3 treatment on the host
compartment, we first examined CXCR3 KO mice in
which the CXCR3 receptor is deleted in all host cells,
which models the pan effect of CXCR3 chemical inhibitor
on all host cells. Deletion of CXCR3 decreased the number
of lung metastases in mice that received 4T1 tumor
injection in #2 mammary fat pad (Figure 5A, left panel),

CXCR3 specific inhibitor AMG487 attenuates
4T1 lung metastasis through effect on both
tumor and host compartment

significantly decreased CXCR3 (Figure 5E), suggesting a
regulatory role of TGF-β in CXCR3 expression. Finally,
IFN-γ neutralization diminished the metastasis inhibition
in the CXCR3 KO mice bearing 4T1 tumors, which was
not seen in the wild type mice (Figure 5F). The differential
effect of IFN-γ neutralization between CXCR3 KO and
wild type was not observed in the primary tumor growth
(Supplementary Figure 3B). These data suggest that
CXCR3 mediated signaling suppressed IFN-γ production
and T cell expansion, thus contribute to lung metastasis.

AMG487 is a specific small molecular inhibitor of
CXCR3, and it has significant inhibitory effect on tumor
progression including breast cancer [14], colon cancer
[18], and osteosarcoma [20]. However, the effect of
AMG487 on both tumor and host compartment needs to
be carefully evaluated. This is because cancer therapies

targeting metastasis not only target tumor cells but also
unavoidably target the host compartment. Here we
focused on the effect of AMG487 on the immune system
of the tumor-bearing host. Mice bearing 4T1 tumors were
injected with AMG487 intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg/dose)
twice daily. The tumor growth, lung metastasis, and
immune cell responses were evaluated after 28 days.
AMG487 decreased the number of lung metastasis
(Figure 6A) and the size of metastasis nodules (Figure 6B),
but did not have an effect on primary tumor growth
(Supplementary Figure 4). Mice treated with AMG487
showed increased CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + cell
numbers in the peripheral blood (Figure 6C), with no

change in the number of Gr-1 + CD11b + myeloid cells
(data not shown). These data suggest that AMG487 not
only targeted cancer cells directly as reported [14] but
also improved host immune responses, thus alleviating
the adverse effect on host immunity often seen in small
molecular inhibitor-based cancer treatment.

DISCUSSION
Therapeutic treatments of cancers not only
target tumor cells but also unavoidably affect the host
compartment. CXCR3 inhibition has emerged as one of
the metastasis-targeting options. Here we evaluate the

effect of CXCR3 targeting on both the tumor cells and
the host compartments. We report that genetic targeting
of CXCR3 in both tumor cells and host-derived cells
showed tumor-inhibitory effect. CXCR3 targeting with the
small molecular inhibitor AMG487 significantly reduced
metastasis and improved host anti-tumor immunity.
The underlying mechanisms involved decreased tumor

cell migration and mobility, and improved myeloid cell
function and T cell response. Our data provide molecular
insight for CXCR3 targeting in metastasis disease
treatment. In addition, our work demonstrates that CXCR3
inhibition may provide double benefits for inhibiting tumor
and improving host immunity, unlike most agents that are
effective in targeting tumor cells but are toxic to host cells.

The increased expression of CXCR3 has been
correlated with poor prognosis in breast, melanoma, colon,
and renal cancer patients [25]. It has been reported that
of the three variants of CXCR3―CXCR3A, CXCR3B,
and CXCR3-alt, the two primary variants―CXCR3A and
CXCR3B [26]―induce opposite physiological functions
[25, 27]. CXCR3A appears to mediate pro-tumor effect
including cell proliferation, survival, chemotaxis,
invasion, and metastasis; whereas CXCR3B mediates
anti-tumor effect via promoting growth suppression,
apoptosis, and vascular involution [25]. Notably, one
recent study reported that CXCR3B likely promotes stem
function; whereas CXCR3A shows pro-proliferative and
metastasis-promoting functions [28]. Here in our study of
mouse models of breast tumor metastasis, targeting mouse

CXCR3, the CXCR3A form, decreased tumor metastasis
(Figure 2). Importantly, CXCR3 expression correlates with
human breast cancer progression and metastasis (Figure 4).
Our finding is in agreement with CXCR3 metastasispromoting function in breast cancer [14–16], colon cancer
[17–19], and osteosarcoma [20], as well as lung cancer
[21]. In breast cancers, the molecular mechanisms of
CXCR3-mediated metastasis involve tumor-host
interaction; for example, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
were recruited to the tumor microenvironment through
CXCL10/CXCR3 axis (MSC/tumor cell), one of the critical
signaling loops mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors
and important in stromal and tumor cell interaction [29,
30]. CXCL10 facilitates trafficking of CXCR3-expressing
cancer cells to bone, and promotes osteolytic bone

metastasis [31], implying host involvement. These studies
and the effect of CXCR3 inhibition that unavoidably
targets the host compartment led us to look into the
contribution of host immune response using CXCR3 KO
mice under tumor conditions.
The effect of CXCR3 on the host immune system has
been recognized as one of the earliest studies showing that
CXCR3 KO mice had profound resistance to development
of acute allograft rejection [32]. In our study, using genetic
approaches of RNA interference and KO mice, as well
as a small molecular inhibitor, we found that targeting
CXCR3 not only directly inhibited tumor cell migration
and mobility, but also improved host immune responses.
Our data support that CXCR3 deletion promoted
type 1 myeloid cell polarization producing less immune
suppressive factors, which in turn enhanced host immune
responses (Figure 5). This is consistent with published
reports in which the effect of CXCR3 small molecular
inhibitor AMG487 depends on Natural Killer cells as NK
depletion compromised AMG487 anti-metastatic activity
[14]. This is also in agreement with reported enhanced
Natural Killer cell function [16]. However, in disagreement
with these publications, and our data, CXCR3-dependent
anti-tumor response has also been reported. The underlying
mechanisms seemed to involve the CXCR3-mediated
signaling for migration and infiltration of the activated T
cells [33–36]. We anticipate that this pro- or anti-tumor
metastasis function is likely context dependent, which is
influenced by the cues of multiple CXCL chemokines in
the tumor microenvironment. For example, CXCR3 was
shown to have an angiostatic effect through CXCL4- or
PF4-mediated signaling [14, 37, 38]. Nevertheless, our
data demonstrate that the totality or net effect of targeting
CXCR3 seemed to inhibit 4T1 metastasis and improve
host immune response.

described [40], labeled with CXCR3 antibody or isotype
control (R&D System, FAB1685P or IC006P), and
analyzed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD, San
Jose, CA). The single cell suspensions from cultured
human breast cancer cell lines, 4T1 cells, or tumor cells
from tumor tissues were isolated by incubating with
0.2 g/L EDTA (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), a
non-enzymatic approach, at 37°C for about 15 min. The
tumor cells were gated on 7AAD negative (exclusion of
dead cells), CD45 negative (exclusion of immune cells),
and high SSC and FSC scatter (largely tumor cells).
For immune cells, single cell suspension was made from
spleens of tumor-bearing CXCR3 KO mice or AMG487
treated mice, and labeled with CD3, CD4, CD8, Gr-1, and
CD11b antibodies, followed by flow cytometry analysis or
sorting by FACSAria flow cytometer (BD, San Jose, CA)
or MACS (Magnetic-activated cell sorting, Miltenyi
Biotec, San Diego, CA).

Immunofluorescence (IF) staining
The tumor cells were cultured on chamber slides,
which were incubated with rat anti-CXCR3 antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Y-16, 1:100 dilution) followed
by Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rat or Alexa Fluor® 594
donkey anti goat IgG (1:200, Invitrogen) for 1 h.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from tumor cell lines and
sorted Gr-1 + CD11b + cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScripttm
First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Relative gene
expression was determined using iCycler-iQ SYBR Green
PCR kit (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are available upon

MATERIALS AND METHODS

shRNA knockdown of CXCR3

Cell lines and mice

Three different lentiviral shRNA constructs were
purchased from Open Biosystems. These vectors were
packaged into lentivirus with the packaging vectors,
pMD2, pRSV-REV, and pMDLg in HEK293T cells.
Lentivirus in the supernatant of HEK293T cells were
harvested and stored at −80°C. Tumor cells (4T1) were
infected using the lentivirus mixture, and selected with
puromycin (4 µg/ml, Invitrogen). The KD efficiency
of CXCR3 in the stable infected cells was evaluated by
q-PCR.

Murine 67NR, 168FARN, 4TO7, 4T1, and
B16F10, as well as human breast cancer cell lines, were
obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection,
Manassas, VA) and kept in liquid nitrogen when not in
use. Cells were thawed, cultured, and passaged less than
six months for experiments. Balb/c CXCR3 KO mice
were originally provided by Dr. Craig Gerard [39]. Female
Balb/c or C57BL/6J mice that were 6–8 weeks old,
16–20 g body weight, were obtained from Charles River
(Germantown, MD). All animal studies were approved
by the National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use
Committee.

Scratch and transwell migration assays
For Scratch assay, the tumor cells were seeded
on 96-well plates (3 × 104/well) in DMEM with 10%
FBS. Eight hours later, cells were starved in serum-free
condition overnight. On the second day, the wound was
created in a straight line using the 96-well wound maker

(IncuCyte, Essen BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI). The
width of the wound was monitored by IncuCyte Zoom
(Essen BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI) and images were
taken every 3 h. The distance migrated was calculated as
Wo-Wt, where Wo represents the original width of the
wound and Wt is the width of wound at each time point.
For migration assay, tumor cells (5 × 104 cells per well)
were seeded on the chamber of a 24-well transwell insert
(8 μM, Corning) in DMEM containing 2% FBS. The plates
were incubated for 6 h at 37°C with 5% CO2. Migrated
tumor cells were fixed by formalin for 10 min and stained
using 0.1% Crystal Violet. The migrated cells, in 4 random
fields under a 10 × objective lens, were counted and the
average cell number was calculated.

Spontaneous and experimental metastasis
For the orthotopic model of metastasis, 4T1 cells
(5 × 104) were injected into the #2 MFP of Balb/c female
mice. Mice were sacrificed 42 days later for evaluation
of metastasis and tumor growth. For B16F10 orthotopic
model, 1 × 106 B16F10 cells were injected subcutaneously,
tumors were removed at day 16, and the mice were
euthanized at day 22. Tumor size was measured at 3–4 day
intervals using calipers as: Volume = length × width2 × 0.5.
For experimental metastasis, mice received tail vein
injection (TVI) of 4T1 or 4T1 CXCR3 KD cells (2 × 105).
The number of lung metastasis was evaluated by whole
lung mounting [41] or India ink staining [42] when
mice died, became moribund, or when the primary
tumors reached a size of 2.0 cm in diameter. For IFN-γ
neutralization, the mice were injected intraperitoneally
with IFN-γ neutralizing antibody XMG-6 or IgG control,
1 mg per mouse on day 1, 3, and 6 and 0.5 mg on
day 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27. Mice were sacrificed
on day 28, and tumor growth, as well as lung metastases,
were evaluated. For AMG487 treatment, Mice
injected with 4T1 tumor cells in mammary fat pad #2
or #4 were injected with AMG487 intraperitoneally
(5 mg/kg/dose) twice a day on day 13–17, and once daily
thereafter. AMG487 was prepared in 20% hydroxypropylb-cyclodextrin in water. The tumor growth, lung
metastasis, and immune cell responses were evaluated on
day 28.
