Abstract
Interleukin (IL)-2 is used in the immunotherapy of patients
with certain cancer and HIV infection. IL-2 treatment reliably
results in 16% to 20% objective clinical response rate in cancer
patients, with significant durability of responses in selected
patients. However, the mechanisms of therapeutic activity
in responding versus nonresponding patients remain poorly
understood. CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells contribute to immunosuppressive networks in human tumors.
We treated 31 ovarian cancer patients with IL-2. We show that
administration of IL-2 induces the proliferation of existent
Treg cells in patients with ovarian cancer. The potency of Treg
cell proliferation is negatively determined by the initial prevalence of Treg cells, suggesting that Treg cells are a factor
for self-controlling Treg cell proliferation. After IL-2 cessation,
the number of Treg cells more efficiently dropped in clinical
responders than nonresponders. Furthermore, IL-2 treatment
stimulates chemokine receptor CXCR4 expression on Treg
cells, enables Treg cell migration toward chemokine CXCL12
in the tumor microenvironment, and may enforce Treg cell
tumor accumulation. Our findings support the concept that
administration of IL-2 numerically and functionally affects
the Treg cell compartment. These data provide an important
insight in evaluating the clinical benefit and therapeutic prediction of IL-2 treatment in patients with cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of the gynecologic cancers,
with 14,500 deaths in the United States each year. Patients who
have disease persisting after primary platinum-based chemotherapy are not able to attain sustained disease free status by the
standard therapy (1). Most second-line cytotoxic therapies in this
setting produce responses in the range of 6% to 12% with
progression-free survivals of 9 to 13 weeks (2). Thus, novel therapy
including immune-based therapy is warranted in treating ovarian
cancer.
Interleukin (IL)-2 is used to boost immunity in patients with HIV
infection (3–6) and with cancer including ovarian cancer, metastatic melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma (7–12). IL-2 treatment
reliably results in a 16% to 20% objective clinical response rate in

cancer patients, with significant durability of responses in selected
patients (7, 8, 13, 14). However, the mechanisms of therapeutic
activity in responding versus nonresponding patients remain
poorly understood. CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells
maintain peripheral T-cell homeostasis (15, 16). Compelling evidence shows that Treg cells play a crucial role in tumor immune
pathogenesis and temper immune therapeutic efficacy (15–21).
Strikingly, the in vitro and in vivo mouse studies show that IL-2
is crucial for the production and function of Treg cells (22–25).
Recent reports have documented that administration of IL-2
increased Treg cell pool in patients with melanoma (26, 27), renal
cell carcinoma (27), and pediatric sarcoma (28). To further
understand the effects of IL-2 on Treg cells, we studied the kinetic
changes of Treg cell phenotype and function in patients with
ovarian cancer undergoing IL-2 treatment.
On the other hand, high levels of CCL22 are found in human
ovarian tumor environment (18, 29, 30), and Treg cells migrate into
tumor environment through CCL22 and suppress T-cell effector
function (18, 31). We thus also studied the potential role of IL-2 in
modulating Treg cell chemokine receptor expression and potential
tumor trafficking in patients with ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Human subjects and clinical responses. Thirty-one patients with
ovarian cancers sequentially entered into an open-labeled phase II IL-2
study. Patients received peritoneal infusion of proleukin (aldesleukin) rIL-2
at a dose of 6  105 IU/m2 weekly for 16 consecutive weeks. This clinical
trial was based on our previous report in treating ovarian cancer patients
with IL-2 peritoneal infusion (7). Eligibility criteria included six or more
courses of prior first- or second-line platinum-based chemotherapy and
laparotomy-confirmed persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer. Complete
clinical responses were defined by the disappearance of all clinically
detectable lesions and no detection of new malignant lesions and confirmed
by open laparoscopy or laparotomy. Progressive disease was defined by a
z25% increase in the product of perpendicular cross diameters at
laparotomy or two-dimensional areas by exam, computer-assisted tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Stable disease was defined as disease
for which dimensions failed to meet the criteria defined above for
progression or regression. Patients who withdrew from the trial due to
various reasons were included in the Treg cell assessments in different time
points and considered as nonresponders. Patients were followed until the
date of death or until the date the study closed. Survival time calculations
were computed from the time of the first dose of IL-2 to the completion of
their follow-up. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards
of the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Michigan.
Human cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from
ovarian cancer patients treated with IL-2 at different time points and from
HLA-A2+ and HLA-A2 healthy donors. CD14+ cells [antigen-presenting
cells (APC)], CD4+CD25 T cells, and CD4+CD25high T cells were sorted with
FACSAria (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) for phenotyping

and functional assays. Cell purity was >98% as confirmed by flow cytometry
(LSR II, Becton Dickinson).
Human FOXP3 detection. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was
carried out for FOXP3 (upstream, 5¶-cagctgcccacactgcccctag-3¶; downstream, 5¶-catttgccagcagtgggtag-3¶) and the housekeeping gene gyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Complementary DNA was
normalized against and expressed as fold differences relative to GAPDH
(32) as described (18). FOXP3 protein was detected by intracellular staining
with rat anti-human FOXP3 antibody (clone PCH101, e-Bioscience).
Treg cell–mediated immunosuppressive assay. T-cell immunosuppression was tested in a coculture system. CD4+CD25 T cells (2  105/mL)
were stimulated with 2.5 Ag/mL antihuman CD3 (clone, UCHT1), 1.2 Ag/mL
antihuman CD28 (clone CD28.2; Becton Dickinson Biosciences), and fresh
monocytes (2  105/mL) in the presence of different concentrations of
CD4+CD25high Treg cells. Seventy-two hours after coculture, T-cell
proliferation was evaluated by thymidine incorporation.
Treg cell in vitro proliferation assay. CD4+CD25high Treg cells
and CD4+CD25 T cells were sorted by FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) with
high purity (>98%). The two populations were mixed based on the FOXP3
expression determined by flow cytometry analysis and cocultured with
recombinant IL-2 (50–200 ng/mL; R&D Systems) or CD14+ cells (APCs;
2  105/mL) in the presence of anti-CD3 (2.5 Ag/mL) plus anti-CD28
(1.2 Ag/mL). In some cases, the T cells were labeled before coculture with
10-Am 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular
Probes) for 10 min in the dark at 37jC. Cell proliferation was determined by
CFSE dilution or antihuman Ki67 staining and was analyzed by flow
cytometry analysis.
Treg cell chemokine receptor expression and migration assay.
Chemokine receptor expression, including CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8,
CXCR1, CXCR3, and CXCR4, was analyzed on human CD4+FOXP3+ T cells.
These CD4 + FOXP3 + T cells were either from normal peripheral
CD4+CD25high cells (1  105/mL) cultured with IL-2 (100 ng/mL) for 1 to
3 days or from peripheral CD4+CD25high cells in ovarian cancer patients
treated with IL-2 for different weeks.
Treg cell migration was assessed as we previously described (29) using
human CD4+CD25high Treg cells (5  104–20  104). Treg cells were induced
to migrate with recombinant human CXCL12, CCL22 (100 ng/mL; R&D
Systems), or ovarian tumor ascites. In some cases, mouse anti-human
CCL22 [57226.11, immunoglobulin G2b (IgG2b); 500 ng/mL] and mouse
anti-human CXCR4 (44717, IgG2b; 500 ng/mL) were added 2 h before
migration assay. Identity of migrating Treg cells was further confirmed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for CD4 and FOXP3 expression.
Statistical analysis. Differences in cell-surface molecule expression were
determined by m2 test, and in other variables by unpaired t test, with
P < 0.05 considered significant. Clinical response rates were calculated for
all patients with a final clinical evaluation as well as on an intention-to-treat
basis. Median survival was calculated for all eligible patients including those
without a final clinical evaluation. A test based on the Cox proportional
hazards with a time-dependent covariate of the difference between the two
groups was used to test survival differences between responders and
nonresponders. A test based on the log-rank test was used to compare
Kaplan-Meier survival curves between different tumor dimensions.

but also the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of FOXP3
expression was increased, suggesting novel FOXP3 synthesis in
each individual FOXP3+ T cell. We further cultured CD4+ T cells
with different concentrations of IL-2. We observed that 50 to 200
ng/mL IL-2 increased FOXP3+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner.
IL-2 at <50 ng/mL induced minimal increase of FOXP3+ T cells
whereas 200 ng/mL IL-2 induced maximal increase of FOXP3+ T
cells (Fig. 1C). We used 100 ng/mL IL-2 in the following in vitro
experiments. Our data indicate that exogenous IL-2 and APCs
stimulate FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation.
IL-2 stimulates the proliferation of existent FOXP3+ T cells.
IL-2 promotes FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation (Fig. 1). It is possible
that IL-2 may stimulate existent FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation
and/or IL-2 may initially convert FOXP3 T cells into FOXP3+ T
cells and subsequently stimulate FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation.
To examine these possibilities, HLA-A2 CD4+CD25high T cells,
HLA-A2 CD4+CD25 T cells, and HLA-A2+CD4+CD25 T cells were
sorted by FACSAria to high purity. The sorted CD4+CD25high T cells
with >85% FOXP3 expression and CD4+CD25 T cells with <0.6%
FOXP3 expression were selected for further experiments (Fig. 2,
left). We proportionally mixed these three populations to reach a
physiologic concentration of Treg cells (9% FOXP3+ cells; Fig. 2,
center). We cultured the mixed cells with IL-2. We observed that
IL-2 significantly increased the FOXP3+ T-cell population. The
increased FOXP3+ T-cell population was predominantly HLA-A2 .
There were <1% HLA-A2+FOXP3+ T cells (Fig. 2, right). We obtained

IL-2 and APCs induce the proliferation of FOXP3+ T cells.
Exogenous IL-2 may increase the Treg cell pool in patients with
melanoma (26, 27) and pediatric sarcoma (28). We tested whether
IL-2 can induce human FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation. Normal
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were labeled with CFSE and stimulated with IL-2 for 2 weeks. We observed that FOXP3+ T cells
actively entered into cell division (Fig. 1A). To determine whether
FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation is unique to IL-2 stimulation, we exposed CD4+ T cells to APCs. In line with our observation on T cells
stimulated with exogenous IL-2 (Fig. 1A), we showed that APCs
induced Ki67+ cells in FOXP3+ T cells (Fig. 1B). Not only the percent

similar results when HLA-A2 CD4+CD25high T cells were replaced
by HLA-A2+CD4+CD25high T cells (not shown). The data suggest
that IL-2 minimally converts CD4+CD25 FOXP3 T cells into
FOXP3+ T cells and that the increased FOXP3+ T cells were mainly
from existent FOXP3+ T cells. Therefore, the increased FOXP3+
T-cell pool by IL-2 is largely due to the proliferation of existent
FOXP3+ T cells.
Prevalence of Treg cells determines the efficacy of FOXP3+
T-cell expansion. Four percent to 10% of CD4+ T cells are Treg
cells in peripheral blood and lymphoid organs in normal human
beings. We examined the effects of the initial prevalence of
existent FOXP3+ T cells on the efficacy of FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation induced by IL-2 and APCs. We sorted by FACSAria
autologous CD4+CD25 and CD4+CD25high T cells to high purity.
The sorted CD4+CD25 T cells with negligible levels of FOXP3
expression (<0.6%) and CD4+CD25high T cells with high levels of
FOXP3 (>85%) were selected for further experiments. To experimentally alter the prevalence of FOXP3+ T cells in the culture
system, we mixed autologous CD4+CD25 T cells with different
concentrations of CD4+CD25high T cells based on the expression
of FOXP3. The mixed cells expressed defined but variable levels
of FOXP3 (Fig. 3A, left). The mixed cells were cultured with IL-2.
When the percent of the initial FOXP3+ T cells was increased,
the percent of Ki67+FOXP3+ T cells in FOXP3+ T cells was accordingly reduced (Fig. 3A and B). More strikingly, when the initial
FOXP3+ T cells were <25%, IL-2 induced a profound Ki67+FOXP3+
T cells in FOXP3+ T cells, whereas when the initial FOXP3+ T cells
were >25%, IL-2 induced limited Ki67+FOXP3+ T cells in FOXP3+
T cells (Fig. 3A and B). The data indicate that the prevalence
of existent FOXP3+ T cells negatively determines the efficacy of
FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation induced by IL-2.
The mixed cells were also stimulated with APCs (Fig. 3C and D).
Similarly, when the percent of the initial FOXP3+ T cells was
increased, the percent of yielded FOXP3+ T cells was accordingly

reduced (Fig. 3C and D). In addition, when the initial FOXP3+ T
cells were <25%, APCs significantly increased the number of
FOXP3+ T cells, whereas when the initial FOXP3+ T cells were >25%,
APCs induced limited FOXP3+ T-cell expansion (Fig. 3C and D).
The data indicate that the prevalence of existent FOXP3+ T cells
negatively determines the efficacy of FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation
induced by APCs.
Altogether, regardless of the nature of stimulation, our data
suggest that FOXP3+ T cells may the decisive factor for selfcontrolling FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation.
Administration of IL-2 increases CD4+CD25high T cells in
patients with ovarian cancer. After determining the role and
characteristics of IL-2 treatment in human Treg cells in vitro,
we further studied Treg cells in patients with ovarian cancer
treated with IL-2. Thirty-one patients with ovarian cancer received
i.p. IL-2 weekly infusion for 16 weeks (Table 1). We observed that
the mean percentage of peripheral blood CD4+CD25high T-cell
was 7% at week 0 (before IL-2 treatment), 13% at weeks 4 to 6
(range, 4–17%), 24% at weeks 8 to 10 (range, 12–35%), and
remained at high levels during the treatment at weeks 12 to 16.
Three weeks after IL-2 cessation, the percentage of CD4+CD25high
cells dropped to 18% (range, 8–28%; Fig. 4A and B). In line with
the percent changes of CD4+CD25high T cells, the mean absolute
number of CD4+CD25high T cells increased significantly from
70/mm3 to 154/mm3 at weeks 4 to 6, 223/mm3 at weeks 8 to 10,
and 278/mm3 at weeks 12 to 16 (Fig. 4C). The absolute number
of CD4+CD25high T cells was reduced to 173/mm3 three weeks
after IL-2 cessation (Fig. 4C). Consistent with our in vitro
observations (Fig. 1), IL-2 administration induced Ki67 expression in CD4+CD25high T cells in patients with ovarian cancer
(Fig. 4B). The data suggest that IL-2 induced Treg cell proliferation
in vivo. Thus, administration of IL-2 increases CD4+CD25high T cells
and promotes CD4+CD25high T-cell proliferation in patients with
ovarian cancer.

IL-2–induced CD4+CD25high T cells express FOXP3 and
suppress T-cell activation. Peripheral and tumor-associated
CD4+CD25high T cells express FOXP3 in ovarian cancers (18). We
sorted CD3+CD4+CD25high cells from IL-2–treated patients to
quantify FOXP3 mRNA expression by real time-PCR (18). We
found a potent FOXP3 mRNA expression in CD4+CD25high T cells at
different time points (Fig. 4D), indicating that IL-2–expanded
CD4+CD25high T cells are phenotypically Treg cells. Notably, FOXP3
mRNA expression was enhanced by IL-2 administration at weeks
4 to 10 (Fig. 4D), suggesting IL-2 induced novel FOXP3 synthesis
on a per cell basis. However, 3 weeks after the cessation of IL-2
administration, FOXP3 mRNA expression was reduced by 40% as

compared with the peak values, suggesting that IL-2 may be needed
to support FOXP3 mRNA expression in vivo.
We further sorted CD4+CD25high T cells and tested their
suppressive activities (18, 33). In a typical immune suppressive
assay, we observed a dose-dependent suppression mediated by
CD4+CD25high T cells sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells at week 0 (before IL-2 infusion) and weeks 9 to 10 (Fig. 4E),
indicating that IL-2–expanded CD4+CD25high T cells are functional
regulatory T cells, and hereafter referred to as Treg cells. Of note,
although the levels of FOXP3 were higher in CD4+CD25high T cells
(Fig. 4E), the suppressive capacity was comparable in the IL2–expanded Treg cells as compared with their counterparts before

IL-2 administration (Fig. 4E). The data indicate that IL-2–induced
Treg cells are functionally suppressive.
IL-2 treatment induces CXCR4 expression on Treg cells. We
recently showed that primary peripheral Treg cells constitutively
express high levels of CCR4 and low levels of CXCR4 (18, 33). We
then studied the effects of IL-2 on Treg cell chemokine receptor
expression. Normal peripheral Treg cells were sorted and cultured
in vitro with IL-2. Multiple chemokine receptors were analyzed.
IL-2 treatment had no effects on the expression of CCR6, CCR7,
CCR8, and CXCR1 (data not shown). Expression of CCR4, CCR5,
and CXCR3 was slightly increased by IL-2. CXCR4 expression was
dramatically increased by IL-2 starting on day 4 and peaked on day
8 on peripheral blood Treg cells (Fig. 5A). We sorted Treg cells from
malignant ascites in patients with ovarian cancer and cultured with
IL-2 and similar results were observed.
We next examined the in vivo effects of IL-2 administration in
patients with ovarian cancer. We showed that CCR4 and CXCR4
expression on Treg cells was increased by IL-2 administration on
week 6 and peaked on week 8. The levels of CCR4 and CXCR4
expression remained high during the IL-2 treatment and declined
3 to 4 weeks after IL-2 cessation (Fig. 5B). The data indicate that
IL-2 up-regulated CCR4 and CXCR4 expression on Treg cells in
patients with ovarian cancer.
IL-2 treatment promotes Treg cell tumor trafficking. We
further tested the function of CXCR4 and CCR4 on IL-2–treated
Treg cells. We previously showed that homeostatic Treg cells

migrate in response to CCL22, the ligand for CCR4, but not to
CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4 (18). We confirmed this observation
and further showed that IL-2–expanded Treg cells efficiently
migrate with both CCL22 and CXCL12 (Fig. 5C). High levels of
CXCL12 and CCL22 are found in the tumor environment (18, 30).
As expected, IL-2–treated Treg cells efficiently migrated with
ovarian tumor ascites (Fig. 5D). Antihuman CXCR4 and anti-CCL22
decreased Treg migration toward malignant ascites. Simultaneous
blockade of CCR4 and CXCR4 completely inhibited Treg cell
migration (Fig. 5D). The data suggest that IL-2 administration may
trigger Treg cell tumor trafficking in response to CCL22 and
CXCL12 in the tumor microenvironment.
Clinical responses and CD4+CD25high T cells. Among 31
patients, there were 24 patients assessable for evaluating clinical
response. Of the 24 patients, there were 6 clinical responses
including 4 patients with complete responses and 2 partial
responses as confirmed by laparotomy (Table 1; Fig. 6A). The
overall clinical response rate was 25% [95% confidence interval
(95% CI), 11–45%]. Mean time to progression in the four patients
with a complete response was 22.5 months (range, 4–54 months).
The median survival of the 31-patient cohort was 2.1 years (95% CI,
1.3–4.4 years; Table 1; Fig. 6A).
Tumor Treg cells suppressed tumor-associated antigen (TAA)–
specific immunity and predicted patient survival (18). We predicted
that IL-2 might induce less Treg cells in clinical responders.
Unexpectedly, we failed to observe a significant difference on the

and nonresponders at weeks 0, 8, and 14 (Fig. 4 and not shown).
Strikingly, more than 3 weeks after IL-2 treatment cessation, the
percent and absolute number of Treg cells were significantly lower
in patients with clinical responses than without clinical response
(Fig. 6B and C). It remains to be defined how and why Treg cells
were more efficiently reduced in patents with clinical responses.
The data suggest that Treg cell dynamics after IL-2 treatment may
predict clinical response.

Discussion
In this study, we report that administration of IL-2 promotes
FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation and potential tumor trafficking in
patients with ovarian cancer.
IL-2 has been used to treat patients with HIV infection and
patients with various tumors (8, 12, 34, 35). Studies of the
mechanisms of IL-2 action have revealed that IL-2 restores the
ability of the immune system to produce CD4+ T cells from T-cell
precursors, stimulate CD4+ T-cell expansion, and activate natural
killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells (6, 11, 36, 37). Recent studies have
shown that IL-2 signals during priming (38) are required for
secondary expansion of CD8+ memory T cells (39). Prior studies
have shown that IL-2 contributes to Treg cell differentiation,
expansion, maintenance, and suppressor function in mice (23, 25,
34, 40, 41). We now report for the first time that in patients with
ovarian cancer, IL-2 administration increases CD4+CD25high T cells.
These CD4+CD25high T cells highly express FOXP3 and efficiently
suppress T-cell activation, suggesting that the IL-2–induced
CD4+CD25+ T cells are predominantly suppressive Treg cells. The
data are consistent with recent studies in patients with melanoma
(26), pediatric sarcoma (28), and HIV infection (42), and reveal a
critical role of IL-2 in maintaining the Treg cell pool in humans.

There are three potential sources for the expanded Treg cell
pool in patients treated with IL-2: Treg cell differentiation,
conventional T-cell conversion, and existent Treg cell proliferation.
Recent studies in patients with HIV infection (42), melanoma
(26, 27), and pediatric sarcoma (28) indicate that the IL-2–
expanded Treg cells were largely from periphery rather than
thymus. We observed an increased FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation
in patients treated with IL-2. We further provide direct evidence
that IL-2 and APCs stimulate existent FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation.
In the absence of transforming growth factor h, CD4+CD25 T
cells are minimally converted to FOXP3+ T cells in our setting. The
data suggest that the proliferation of existent Treg cells is the
principal mechanism responsible for IL-2–induced Treg cell pool
expansion.
We observed another important characteristic in the expansion
of FOXP3+ T-cell pool induced by IL-2 or APCs: FOXP3+ T-cell
proliferation is proportionally controlled by FOXP3+ T cells
themselves. When we experimentally altered the prevalence of
FOXP3+ T cells in our culture system, we found that the lower
percentage of FOXP3+ T cells resulted in more efficient FOXP3+
T-cell proliferation when exposed to IL-2 or APCs. When the
FOXP3+ T-cell percentage is >25%, the proliferative response to IL-2
or APCs is significantly reduced. The cutoff point seems to be
f25% FOXP3+ T cells. The data suggest several possibilities: (a)
Treg cells may suppress Treg cell proliferation. (b) Depletion of
Treg cells is suggested to be a novel strategy to treat human cancer
(19, 43–45). It is a technical challenge to completely deplete Treg
cells in the human body. Strategies resulting in partial reduction of
Treg cells and following IL-2 or APC vaccination may promote Treg
cell proliferation and comprise the effects of immunotherapy and
vaccination.
In addition to stimulating Treg cell expansion, we have further
shown that IL-2 may enforce Treg cell tumor trafficking. This

concept is supported by two lines of evidence. First, IL-2 stimulates
CXCR4 and CCR4 expression on Treg cells in vitro and in vivo.
Second, after IL-2 treatment, Treg cells efficiently migrate with

microenvironment. Altogether, our study suggests a previously
unappreciated role of IL-2 in Treg cell trafficking and migration.
Enhanced Treg cell tumor trafficking may possibly contribute to
tumor relapse.
Treg cells suppress TAA-specific T-cell immunity and negatively
affect patient survival (18). It is predicted that the increased Treg
cells may affect clinical responses in patients treated with IL-2.
Unexpectedly, although our sample size is limited, we observed no
significant difference for the percent and absolute number of Treg
cells before and during IL-2 treatment between responders and
nonresponders. Although our data suggest that initial Treg cells do
not predict clinical responses in IL-2 immunotherapy among
responders and nonresponders, we observed that after IL-2
cessation, the reduction of Treg cells is significantly faster in
responders than nonresponders. It is possible that IL-2 efficiently
activates CD8 and NK cells, and these cells may possibly induce
Treg cell killing and subsequently result in Treg cell reduction, or
Treg cells traffic into other compartment such as lymph nodes and
bone marrow (31, 33). It is essential to confirm and extend this
observation in a larger patient pool with a substantial amount
of responders. Nonetheless, our data suggest that Treg cell dynamics may be an important determinant of IL-2–induced tumor
immunity.
In summary, our studies show that IL-2 administration
stimulates existent FOXP3+ T-cell proliferation and may promote
Treg cell tumor trafficking in patients with ovarian cancer.
