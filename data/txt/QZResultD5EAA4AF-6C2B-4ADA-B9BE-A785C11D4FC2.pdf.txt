Abstract
2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a synthetic glucose analogue that
acts as a glycolytic inhibitor, is currently being evaluated in
the clinic as an anticancer agent. In this study, we observed
that treatment of human glioma cells with 2-DG activated
autophagy, a highly conserved cellular response to metabolic
stress and a catabolic process of self-digestion of intracellular
organelles for energy use and survival in stressed cells. The
induction of autophagy by 2-DG was associated with activation of elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2 kinase), a structurally
and functionally unique enzyme that phosphorylates eEF-2,
leading to loss of affinity of this elongation factor for the
ribosome and to termination of protein elongation. We also
showed that inhibition of eEF-2 kinase by RNA interference
blunted the 2-DG–induced autophagic response, resulted in a
greater reduction of cellular ATP contents, and increased the
sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxic effect of 2-DG.
Furthermore, the blunted autophagy and enhanced 2-DG
cytotoxicity were accompanied by augmentation of apoptosis
in cells in which eEF-2 kinase expression was knocked down.
The results of this study indicate that the energy stress and
cytotoxicity caused by 2-DG can be accelerated by inhibition
of eEF-2 kinase, and suggest that targeting eEF-2 kinase–
regulated autophagic survival pathway may represent a novel
approach to sensitizing cancer cells to glycolytic inhibitors.

Introduction
Cellular metabolism of malignant cells differs significantly from
that of normal cells. Whereas normal cells rely on respiration, a
process that consumes oxygen and glucose to produce energystoring molecule ATP, malignant cells mainly depend on glycolysis,
the anaerobic metabolism of glucose into ATP, even in the presence
of sufficient oxygen. This increased dependency of malignant cells
on glycolysis for ATP production is known as the so-called Warburg
effect (1, 2). A number of molecular pathways have been revealed to
be associated with this metabolic phenotype, including hexokinase
2 (3, 4), p53 (5), c-Myc (6, 7), HIF-1 (7), and defect in mitochondrial

respiration (8). Due to the high dependence of malignant cells on
glycolysis, interfering with this metabolic process has recently been
proposed as a potentially useful approach for developing new
selective cancer therapy (9). Treatment of cancer cells with
2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a synthetic glucose analogue that acts
as a glycolytic inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit growth and
viability of cancer cells (10–12), and enhance the efficacy of cancer
chemotherapeutics and radiation regiments (13–18). In both
in vitro and in vivo models, 2-DG was effective in the treatment
of a variety of solid tumors (19–21). The pharmacologic basis of
antitumor action of 2-DG is believed to be the high dependence of
malignant cells, especially those hypoxic cells on glycolysis, the
preferred ingestion and retention of 2-DG by tumor cells, and the
blocking effect of 2-DG on glucose metabolic pathways. In addition,
2-DG causes oxidative stress through increasing pro-oxidant
production and disrupting thiol metabolism, as evidenced by
alterations in total glutathione content (16, 22). In the treatment of
human brain malignancies, 2-DG has been shown to be effective in
sensitizing tumor cells to radiation therapy (17, 23). Despite the
demonstrations of the antitumor activity of 2-DG, large doses are
usually needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, and cancer cells
quickly become refractory to this agent. Therefore, approaches that
can enhance the efficacy of 2-DG may make this agent more useful
in the treatment of cancers.
Elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2 kinase; aka calmodulindependent protein kinase III), a unique calmodulin/calciumdependent enzyme that inhibits protein synthesis, is overexpressed
in several types of malignancies including gliomas (24, 25). eEF-2
kinase phosphorylates elongation factor-2, a 100-kDa protein that
mediates the translocation step in peptide-chain elongation by
inducing the transfer of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosomal A to P
site. Phosphorylation of EF-2 at Thr56 by eEF-2 kinase decreases
the affinity of this elongation factor for ribosomes and terminates
elongation, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Because protein
synthesis requires a large proportion of cellular energy (26, 27),
inhibition of protein synthesis by terminating elongation through
activating eEF-2 kinase decreases energy use, and provides a
survival mechanism against energy stress.
We have recently reported the critical role of eEF-2 kinase in the
regulation of autophagy, a highly conserved cellular process that is
activated in times of metabolic or environmental stress and leads
to large-scale degradation of proteins (28). The process of
autophagy involves formation of a double-membrane vesicle
(‘‘autophagosome’’) in the cytosol that engulfs organelles and
cytoplasm, then fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosme,
where the contents are degraded and recycled for protein and ATP
synthesis (29). The formation of the autophagosome is mediated
by a series of autophagy specific genes (ATG). This form of

self-digestion leads to self-preservation in times of nutrient
deprivation; however, if left unchecked, autophagy has the
potential of producing terminal self-consumption. Although
apoptosis is known as type I cell death, autophagy is called type
II cell death. We showed in human glioma cells that the activity
of eEF-2 kinase is closely associated with the mammalian macroautophagy pathway that is activated in response to nutrient,
growth factor or oxygen deprivation. Furthermore, inhibition of
eEF-2 kinase blunts autophagy and has deleterious effects on cell
viability under nutrient starvation condition (28). These observations raise the possibility that blocking the activation of eEF-2 kinase
may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to promote cell death
induced by metabolic stress. As 2-DG inhibits cell growth and causes
death of tumor cells through antagonizing glucose (20), we sought to
determine the effects of this glycolytic inhibitor on eEF-2 kinase
activity and autophagic cell survival pathway, and the effect of
inhibiting eEF-2 kinase on sensitivity of tumor cells to 2-DG. We
found that treatment of human glioma cells with 2-DG activated an
eEF-2 kinase–dependent autophagic response, and inhibiting eEF-2
kinase by RNA interference (RNAi) blocked the induction of
autophagy by 2-DG and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to
the cytotoxic effect of this glycolytic inhibitor. Our results suggest
that targeting the eEF-2 kinase–regulated autophagic pathway could
be an effective approach to augmenting the activity of 2-DG, and
thus may have clinical implication in cancer treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture. The human glioblastoma cell lines, T98G and
LN-229, were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. T98G
cells were cultured in Ham’s F-10: DMEM (10:1) medium, and LN-229 cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Cells were
maintained at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air.
Reagents and antibodies. 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and anti–a-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. All cell culture medium and other
products were purchased from Invitrogen Corporation. Chemiluminescence

Western blot reagents were obtained from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.
The following antibodies were used in this study: anti–caspase-3 antibody,
anti–eEF-2 kinase, anti–eEF-2, anti–phospho-eEF-2 (Thr56), anti–phosphoAMPKa (Thr172); and anti-AMPKa, anti-S6 kinase, anti–phospho-S6 kinase
(Thr389) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies); monoclonal anti-LC3
antibody (nanoTools, though Axxora; LLC).
siRNA preparation and transfection. siRNA sequence targeting eEF-2
kinase mRNA corresponded to the coding region 144 to 164 (5¶AAGCTCGAACCAGAATGTC-3¶) relative to the start codon (28). siRNA
duplexes were prepared by Dharmacon Research, Inc. For transfection, cells
in exponential phase of growth were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes
at 5  105 cells per dish, grown for 24 h, then transfected with siRNA
(100 nmol/L) using Oligofectamine and OPTI-MEM I–reduced serum
medium, according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The concentrations
of siRNAs were chosen based on dose-response studies. Twenty-four hours
after transfection, the cells were harvested for further experiments.
Measurement of protein synthesis. The rate of protein synthesis was
measured as described previously (30). Briefly, cells were seeded in 60-mm
tissue culture dishes and labeled with 25 ACi/mL of EasyTag EXPRESS [35S]
protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer) in RPMI 1640. After incubation at 37jC
for 15 min, cells were washed 4 times with 4 mL of ice-cold PBS and lysed
in 200 AL of Complete Lysis-M lysis reagent containing the Mini Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were collected in a microfuge
tube and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. The
supernatants were precipitated with 20% of trichloracetic acid and collected
on GF/C filters (Millipore). The filters were washed 4 times with 1 mL of 10%
trichloracetic acid and subject to liquid scintillation counting. The specific
activity of protein synthesis was determined by the amount of incorporated
35
S-methionine/cysteine per mg of total protein per min.
Measurement of cellular ATP. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at
2.5  103 cells per well and treated with 2-DG for 24 h. ATP contents were
determined using the ATPlite Luminescence Assay kit (PerkinElmer)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The luminescence was measured
by a Victor3 Multi Label plate reader (PerkinElmer).
Measurement of autophagy. Autophagy was monitored by measuring
the formation of LC3-II in the absence or presence of lysosomal protease
inhibitors E64D (10 Ag/mL) and pepstatin A (10 Ag/mL), as described by
Tanida and colleagues (31). For detection of LC3-II, cell lysates were
prepared and 25 Ag of total proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis
using a monoclonal anti-LC3 antibody. GFP-LC3 cleavage assay was
performed as previously described (32). Briefly, cells (1  106) were

cotransfected with 3 Ag of GFP-LC3 plasmid DNA and an eEF-2 kinase–
targeted siRNA or a nontargeting RNA in Opti-MEM reduced medium
(Invitrogen) and incubated overnight at 37jC. The cells were then treated
with 2-DG in the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors E64d (10 Ag/mL)
and pepstatin A (10 Ag/mL). At the end of treatment, cells were fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 15 min and inspected at 60 magnification for
numbers of GFP-LC3 puncta. Autophagy was also evaluated by electron
microscopic examination of double or multimembrane vacuoles in the
cytoplasm, as described below.
Western blot analysis. Cells were pelleted at 500  g for 5 min and were
lysed in cold lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmol/L sodium PPi,
1 mmol/L h-glycerolphosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin, and
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and sonicated for 5 s. The lysates
were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 30 min at 4jC. Identical
amounts (25 Ag of protein) of cell lysates were resolved by 8% or 15% SDSPAGE, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene
difluoride. Membranes were incubated in blocking solution consisting of
5% powered milk in TBST [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
and 0.1% Tween 20] for 1 h, then immunoblotted with the respective
antibodies. Detection by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence was carried out
according to the protocol of the manufacturer.

Electron microscopy. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed in
2.5% gluteraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer,
and then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide buffer. After dehydration in
acetone, the cells were embedded in spur resin. Thin sections (90 nm) were
cut on a Reichert Ultracut E microtome. Sectioned grids were stained with
saturated solution of uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were
examined at 80 kV with a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope.
Cellular viability. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Briefly, cells
were plated at 5  103 per well in 96-well tissue culture plates and
incubated at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air.
The formazan product, formed after a 4-h incubation with MTT, was
dissolved in DMSO and read at 570 nm using a Victor3 Multi Label plate
reader (PerkinElmer).
Measurement of apoptosis. Active caspase-3, which is present in cells
undergoing apoptosis, was detected by Western blot using polyclonal anti–
caspase-3 antibody that recognizes the cleaved, active caspase-3, as
described previously (33). For apoptotic nuclei staining, pEGFP-transfected
cells with different treatments were stained with Hoechst 33342 and
observed under green fluorescence and UV. Green fluorescent protein
(GFP)-positive cells were scored for the presence of apoptotic nuclei, and
apoptotic rates were presented as the percentage of apoptotic cells out of
the total number of GFP-positive cells assessed (34).

microscope. Arrows, autophagic vacuoles. D, T98G cells cultured in medium
containing low or high concentration of glucose were treated with the

and eEF-2 kinase were detected by Western blot using the respective
antibodies. Tubulin was used as a loading control. Results shown are the
representative of three similar experiments.

Results
Treatment with 2-DG activates eEF2 kinase and decreases
protein synthesis in glioma cells. We previously reported that
nutrient depletion caused activation of eEF2 kinase and autophagy
in glioma cells, and blocking activation of eEF-2 kinase blunted
the autophagic response (28). To determine the specific effect of
glucose deprivation on the activity of eEF-2 kinase and autophagy,
we first treated T98G and LN229 human glioma cells with varying
concentrations of 2-DG, and then assayed the activity of the kinase.
As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of these glioma cells with 2-DG for
24 hours increased the activity of eEF-2 kinase in a dose-dependent
manner, as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation of its
substrate, EF2. To confirm the stimulatory effect of 2-DG on eEF-2
kinase activity, we compared the rate of protein synthesis in the
cells treated with 2-DG to that of the cells treated with vehicle.
Figure 1B shows that protein synthesis in the cells treated with
2-DG was markedly inhibited compared with that in vehicle-treated
cells. These results were consistent with the role of eEF-2 kinase
in regulating translation, i.e., activation of eEF-2 kinase inhibits
elongation. Activation of eEF-2 kinase by 2-DG was accompanied
by a reduction of cellular ATP contents (Fig. 2A), an inactivation
(decreased phosphorylation) of the key translational governor and
downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),
S6 kinase (Fig. 2B), and an activation of AMPK, as shown by
the increased phosphorylation of this intracellular energy sensor
(Fig. 2C). These results indicate that treatment of glioma cells with
2-DG elicited an energy stress response.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

Treatment with 2-DG induces autophagy in glioma cells.
Given the effects of 2-DG on the activities of eEF-2 kinase (Fig. 1),
S6 kinase, AMPK, and the cellular level of ATP (Fig. 2), we next
determined whether treatment of tumor cells with this glycolytic
inhibitor induced autophagy. LC3-II, a cleaved product of
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, was used as
a marker for autophagy. We found that both steady-state level
(Fig. 3A) and turnover (Fig. 3B) of LC3-II were increased in the
glioma cells treated with 2-DG, compared with the cells treated
with the vehicle. The induction of autophagy by 2-DG was
confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. 3C), which visualized
abundant double or multimembrane vacuoles in the cytoplasm of
the cells treated with 2-DG. By contrast, these vacuoles were rarely
observed in glioma cells treated with the vehicle (Fig. 3C). Although
the basal level of autophagy in cells cultured in medium containing
high concentration of glucose (25 mmol/L) was much lower than
that in cells cultured in medium with low concentration of glucose
(5.6 mmol/L), under either condition 2-DG activated autophagy in
these tumor cells, and the levels of autophagy were correlated to
the activity of eEF-2 kinase (Fig. 3D).
Silencing of EF-2 kinase expression blunts the 2-DG–
induced autophagy. To further investigate whether induction of
autophagy by 2-DG was mediated through eEF-2 kinase, we
silenced the expression of eEF-2 kinase using RNAi approach and
then determined the effect of eEF-2 kinase inhibition on the
autophagic response to 2-DG treatment. Tumor cells were transfected with an eEF-2 kinase–targeted siRNA or nontargeting RNA

for 24 hours, and then treated with various concentrations of 2-DG.
Figure 4A shows that knockdown of eEF-2 kinase expression
decreased the activity of the enzyme, as indicated by the dramatic
decreases in the phospo-EF-2 at Thr56, and blunted the autophagic
response in the cells treated with 2-DG, as manifested by the
decreased formation of LC3-II. Electron microscopy and GFP-LC3
cleavage assay also showed that silencing of eEF-2 kinase by siRNA
blocked the 2-DG–induced autophagy, as evidenced by the
decreased formation of double-membrane vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B) and decreased numbers of cells with >20 GFP-LC3
punctae (Fig. 4C). Moreover, silencing of eEF-2 kinase also
diminished the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on protein synthesis
(Fig. 5A) and accelerated the 2-DG–induced reduction of cellular
ATP contents (Fig. 5B), further indicating that inhibition of this
kinase weakens the adaptive response of cells to metabolic stress
and worsens the energy supply.
Silencing of eEF-2 kinase expression enhances the sensitivity
of glioma cells to 2-DG. It has been shown that autophagy
promotes cell survival under conditions of nutrient deprivation and
that inhibiting eEF-2 kinase can abrogate this prosurvival response
(28). To test whether blockade of 2-DG–activated autophagy via
inhibiting eEF-2 kinase could enhance the cytotoxicity of this
glycolytic inhibitor, we transfected tumor cells with a nontargeting
RNA or siRNA targeting eEF-2 kinase, then exposed the cells to
various concentrations of 2-DG. As shown in Fig. 6A, the
cytotoxicity of 2-DG was significantly increased by silencing
eEF-2 kinase expression in T98G and LN-229 glioma cells. To
explore the mechanism underlying the increased 2-DG cytotoxicity
in cells with decreased eEF-2 kinase activity, we compared

apoptosis in tumor cells with and without silencing of the enzyme
after 2-DG treatment. Figure 6B shows that treatment of T98G cells
with 2-DG not only activated autophagy, as measured by the
formation of LC3-II, but also triggered apoptosis in a dosedependent manner, as measured by the activation of caspase-3.
More notably, inhibition of autophagy by silencing of eEF-2 kinase
augmented apoptosis triggered by 2-DG, as evidenced by the
increased appearance of the cleaved form of caspase-3 (Fig. 6B)
and increased apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 6C), suggesting an increased
death in cells with inhibition of eEF-2 kinase.

Discussion
eEF-2 kinase is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme that
regulates protein elongation (35), and has been observed to be upregulated in human and rat gliomas (25, 36). This kinase was
subsequently found to have several unique characteristics including the ability to phosphorylate serines and threonines within a
helical turns (37). Further work by Proud’s group (38) showed the
exquisite regulation of eEF-2 kinase by multiple enzymes involved
in energy sensing and use, including mTOR, S6 kinase, and AMP
kinase (39, 40). The role of eEF-2 kinase as an energy sensor was
also shown in a study showing that this enzyme participates in the
AMPK-mediated cardioprotection in response to metabolic stress
(41). When exploring the role of eEF-2 kinase in malignant cells, we
found that the activity of eEF-2 kinase and autophagy were rapidly
increased by nutrient deprivation and that inhibiting the enzyme
markedly diminished autophagic cell survival (28), suggesting that

this apparent relationship between eEF-2 kinase activity and cell
survival might be linked directly to its role in protein synthesis.
In this study, we used the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-DG, to further
explore the role of eEF-2 kinase in the autophagic response to
energy stress. We show in human glioma cells that treatment with
2-DG activates autophagy (Fig. 3); the induction of autophagy by
2-DG seems to be dependent on the activity of eEF-2 kinase, as
treatment with 2-DG also activates this kinase (Fig. 1); and
knockdown of eEF-2 kinase expression blunts the autophagic
response induced by 2-DG (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we show that
silencing of eEF-2 kinase expression increases the cytotoxicity of
2-DG (Fig. 6A) and augments apoptosis (Fig. 6B and C). Because
autophagy is known to favor cell survival under environmental and
metabolic stress conditions (42–44), 2-DG–induced autophagy may
represent an adaptive response to the reduction of energy supply
caused by this glycolytic inhibitor, and explain, at least in part, the
decreased sensitivity of tumor cells after exposure to this agent.
Although the two glioma cell lines used in this study, T98G and
LN-229, harbor aberrant and wild-type PTEN, respectively (45, 46),
our results from the two cell lines were consistent, suggesting that
different expression of PTEN does not affect the autophagic
response to 2-DG treatment and the effect of inhibiting eEF-2
kinase on sensitivity to 2-DG.
The results showing that 2-DG–induced autophagy is associated
with the activity of eEF-2 kinase are consistent with our previous
observation that induction of autophagy by metabolic stress is
regulated by this kinase (28), although the precise mechanism
underlying this regulation is still unclear. The association of eEF-2
kinase activity with the regulation of autophagy is consistent with
the function of this kinase, which acts as an inhibitor of peptide
elongation. Protein synthesis is a process that accounts for a major
percentage of energy consumption (26, 27); therefore, inhibition of
protein synthesis may decrease cellular energy use to withstand
nutrient starvation such as glucose deprivation. The activity of eEF2 kinase is tightly regulated by signaling pathways involved in
nutrient use and energy monitoring in the cell. For example, Proud’s
group (38) reported that eEF-2 kinase is inhibited by mTOR and
S6 kinase signaling pathways. They also show that eEF-2 kinase
is activated by AMP kinase, an intracellular energy sensor that
regulates cell metabolism (39, 40). Thus, the activation of eEF-2
kinase in 2-DG–treated cells could be a consequence of energy
stress caused by this glycolytic inhibitor, as treatment of this agent
leads to reduction of cellular ATP contents (Fig. 2A), decreased
activity of S6 kinase (Fig. 2B), and increased activity of AMP kinase
(Fig. 2C). A recent study in breast cancer cells also shows the
activation of AMP kinase and deactivation of S6 kinase by 2-DG (47).
These results support our hypothesis that induction of autophagy
by 2-DG is a type of metabolic adaptation to energy stress because
autophagy can increase ATP production through autophagic
recycling of amino acids produced from digestion of cellular
organelles and proteins, thus favoring cell survival in times of
cellular stress. The stimulatory effect of 2-DG on autophagy may
also contribute to the phenomenon that this agent protects glioma
cells from glucose withdrawal–induced cell death (48). Additionally,
our results showing that basal level of autophagy is higher in cells
cultured in medium containing low concentration of glucose than
in cells cultured in medium containing high concentration of
glucose (Fig. 3D) also support the role of autophagy as a prosurvival
mechanism in cells stressed by nutrient deprivation or metabolic
alteration. Silencing of eEF-2 kinase does not completely suppress
the autophagic response activated by 2-DG (Fig. 4), probably due to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

the fact that 2-DG treatment also causes oxidative stress (49) and
this type of stress is a trigger for autophagy via other pathways (50).
Thus, inhibiting multiple autophagic pathways might result in a
more profound suppression of 2-DG–activated autophagy and
hence increase the anticancer activity of this agent. It has been
reported that inhibition of glutamate cysteine ligase, an enzyme
involved in the glutathione synthetic pathway, sensitizes tumor cells
to the cytotoxicity of 2-DG (22). We recognize that autophagy may
also lead to cell death that is accompanied by caspase activation
(51); however, based on our results, the role of autophagy is
prosurvival but not prodeath in response to 2-DG treatment, as we
observed that although silencing of eEF-2 kinase expression further
increased caspase-3 activation in glioma cells treated with 2-DG
(Fig. 6B), autophagy was inhibited. Moreover, cell viability was also
decreased in siRNA-treated cells compared with the nontargeting
RNA-treated cells (Fig. 6A).
Malignant cells use glucose at a higher rate than normal cells,
and become more dependent on aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis.
Hypoxic tumor cells are particularly dependent on anaerobic
glycolysis, and are therefore more sensitive to 2-DG–induced cell
cycle inhibition and cytotoxicity (12). Moreover, due to the upregulation of glucose transporters in tumor cells and high affinity
of 2-DG for glucose transporters, malignant cells show an enhanced
uptake and retention of this agent (52). These factors are believed
to contribute to the preferential toxicity of 2-DG in cancer cells. In
this study, we show that targeting eEF-2 kinase, an inhibitor of
protein elongation, can enhance the sensitivity of glioma cells to
2-DG (Fig. 6A). The potentiation of 2-DG cytotoxicity by inhibition

Figure 5. Silencing of eEF-2 kinase expression mitigates the inhibition of protein
synthesis (A ) and worsened the energy stress (B ) in the 2-DG–treated glioma
cells. T98G cells were transfected with a nontargeting RNA (NT) or an eEF-2
kinase–targeted siRNA (100 nmol/L) for 24 h, and then treated with the indicated
concentrations of 2-DG. At the end of treatment, (A ) protein synthesis activity
was determined as described in Fig. 1B. B, ATP content was measured
as described in Fig. 2A . Results shown are the representative of three

Figure 6. Silencing of eEF-2 kinase expression increases the sensitivity of glioma cells to the cytotoxicity of 2-DG. A, T98G or LN-229 cells transfected with a
nontargeting RNA or an eEF-2 kinase–targeted siRNA were treated with the indicated concentrations of 2-DG for 60 h. At the end of treatment, cell viability was
measured using MTT assay. Points, mean of quadruplicate determinations; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05. B, T98G cells with or without silencing of eEF-2 kinase expression
were treated with the indicated concentrations of 2-DG for 24 h. Caspase-3, LC3-II, and eEF-2 kinase were detected by Western blot, as described in Materials and
Methods. Tubulin was used as a loading control. C, T98G cells were cotransfected with a pEGFP expression vector and a siRNA targeting eEF-2 kinase or a
nontargeting RNA, and then treated with the indicated concentrations of 2-DG. At the end of treatment, cells were fixed, stained with Hoechst 33342, and observed
under green fluorescence and UV. GFP-positive cells were scored for the presence of apoptotic nuclei, and apoptotic rates were presented as the percentage of
apoptotic cells out of the total number of GFP-positive cells assessed. Columns, mean of triplicate determinations; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.

of eEF-2 kinase seems to result from the metabolic catastrophe
caused by the glycolytic inhibitor, as autophagy is markedly
attenuated and ATP level is further decreased (due to recovery of
protein synthesis) in tumor cells with silencing of eEF-2 kinase in
comparison with the cells without the silencing of the enzyme
(Figs. 4 and 5). Inducing metabolic catastrophe in cancer cells has
been proposed as a new therapeutic approach awaiting for further
investigation (53).
2-DG has entered into phase I clinical trials, but results of the
clinical studies have not been well-documented in literatures.
However, a recent study reported that 2-DG significantly prolongs
survival of the mice bearing aggressive lymphoma with defective
laforin expression (21). The results of the current study show that
the cytotoxic effect of 2-DG on tumor cells can be potentiated by
suppressing an eEF-2 kinase–dependent autophagic survival
pathway, suggesting that 2-DG treatment in combination with
the inhibition of eEF-2 kinase may stand for a new therapeutic
strategy to improve the efficacy of this glycolytic inhibitor against
malignant tumors. We have identified the inhibitors of eEF-2 kinase
and reported their effects on cancer cell lines (54), and are
currently evaluating the in vivo effectiveness and pharmacokinetic

properties of those compounds through National Cancer Institute’s
Rapid Access to Intervention Development program. Because eEF2 kinase is up-regulated in several types of cancers, we expect that
development and use of inhibitors of the kinase with favorable
pharmacokinetic characteristics would increase the selectivity and
effectiveness of glycolytic inhibitors such as 2-DG. Taken together,
our study underscores the potential of eEF-2 kinase as a
complementary target for sensitizing tumor cells to the glycolysis-targeted therapy.
