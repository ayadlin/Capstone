Abstract
Therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases have shown efficacy in molecularly defined subsets of cancers.
Unfortunately, cancers invariably develop resistance, and overcoming or preventing resistance will ultimately be
key to unleashing their full therapeutic potential. In this study, we examined how cancers become resistant to
MET inhibitors, a class of drugs currently under clinical development. We utilized the highly sensitive gastric
carcinoma cell line, SNU638, and two related MET inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF-2341066. To our surprise, we
observed at least two mechanisms of resistance that arose simultaneously. Both resulted in maintenance of
downstream PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT and MEK (MAP/ERK kinase)-ERK signaling in the presence
of inhibitor. One mechanism, observed by modeling resistance both in vitro and in vivo, involved the acquisition
of a mutation in the MET activation loop (Y1230). Structural analysis indicates that this mutation destabilizes
the autoinhibitory conformation of MET and abrogates an important aromatic stacking interaction with the
inhibitor. The other cause of resistance was activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway
due to increased expression of transforming growth factor a. Activation of EGFR bypassed the need for MET
signaling to activate downstream signaling in these cells. This resistance could be overcome by combined EGFR
and MET inhibition. Thus, therapeutic strategies that combine MET inhibitors capable of inhibiting Y1230
mutant MET in combination with anti-EGFR–based therapies may enhance clinical benefit for patients with
MET-addicted cancers. Importantly, these results also underscore the notion that a single cancer can
simultaneously develop resistance induced by several mechanisms and highlight the daunting challenges
associated with preventing or overcoming resistance. Cancer Res; 71(3); 1081–91. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The emerging impact of targeted therapies as cancer treatments is promoting a paradigm shift in the field of oncology.
Concomitant with the exciting progress in this field is the
realization that the benefits associated with many of these
therapies, although pronounced, are temporary. The emergence of resistance has limited the effectiveness of these
therapies, and this observation has spurred efforts to understand how cancers become resistant to targeted therapies. The
understanding of how resistance emerges should enable us to
develop strategies to overcome or prevent resistance, thereby

unleashing a greater therapeutic benefit for our patients. In
the field of acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors, 2 major
kinds of resistance mechanisms have begun to emerge: (i)
mutations in the target kinase itself that abrogate the inhibitory action of the drug [e.g., T790M in epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) and T315I in ABL] or (ii) activation of
other signaling events that bypass the continued requirement
for the original target (reviewed in refs. 1, 2).
MET is the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for hepatocyte
growth factors (HGF), also called scatter factors (SF; refs. 3, 4).
Although MET has been implicated in the metastases and
migration of cancer cells (5, 6), recent studies have revealed
that a subset of cancers are "addicted" to MET signaling. Such
cancers include gastric carcinomas that harbor amplification of
the MET oncogenes (7). In these cancers, MET inhibition
dramatically reduces cell viability and invariably leads to downregulation of the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT and
MEK (MAP/ERK kinase)-ERK signaling pathways (7, 8). In
addition, MET activation, via amplification or with a ligand,
has been identified as an acquired resistance mechanism to
EGFR inhibitors in EGFR mutant non–small cell lung cancers
(8–11). In these cancers, concomitant inhibition of MET and
EGFR leads to marked reduction of cell viability both in vitro
and in vivo (8–11). These observations have increased enthusiasm for developing MET inhibitors as cancer therapeutics.

Although encouraging clinical data with MET are emerging
(12, 13), experience with other RTK inhibitors suggests that
resistance will develop even in the subset of cancers that
initially derive clinical benefit. In addition, there is also the
concern that a single cancer may develop multiple, distinct
resistance mechanisms simultaneously. For example, in an
autopsy of a lung cancer patient who became resistant to
EGFR inhibitors, different resistance mechanisms were
observed in distinct metastatic sites (8, 9). Indeed, the prevalence of simultaneous heterogeneous resistance mechanisms remains unknown, as does its potential impact on our
ability to reinduce remissions.
In this study, we have examined how cancers can become
resistant to MET inhibitors. We examined resistance with the
highly sensitive gastric carcinoma cell line SNU638. Acquired
resistance was modeled in vitro and in vivo to 2 related MET
inhibitors PHA-665752 and PF-2341066 (crizotinib). (crizotinib). Surprisingly, we observed that the single cell line,
SNU638, simultaneously developed 2 distinct mechanisms
to maintain downstream signals for cell survival.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The SNU638 cell line was characterized previously (8). The
cell lines MKN45 and EBC-1 were provided by Dr. Jeffrey
Settleman (Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boston, MA). Both cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640
with L-glutamine (Cellgro; Mediatech Inc.) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100
units/mL streptomycin. PHA-665752 and PF-2341066 were
obtained from Tocris and ChemieTek, respectively, and PF00299804 was provided by Pfizer. Stock solutions were prepared in DMSO and stored at 20 C.
Antibodies against ERBB3 and AKT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p85 and GAB2 (Millipore); GAPDH (Chemicon); and
actin (Sigma) were used per manufacturer's directions. All
other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. The
human phospho-RTK array kit, human transforming growth
factor a (TGFa) immunoassay, and recombinant human
TGFa were purchased from R&D Systems.
ShRNA and lentiviral infection
MET, ERBB3, and scrambled [(scRNA) control] short hairpin RNA (shRNA) contructs were described previously (8).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot
Cells were treated with PHA-667572 for 6 hours and then
lysed using lysis buffer (20 mmol/L Tris, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
NP40, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, and protease and phosphatase
inhibitors). Coimmunoprecipitations with the PI3K regular
subunit p85 were carried out as previously described (14).
Xenograft studies
Nude mice (nu/nu; 6–8 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories) were carried out in accordance with the standards of
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Massachusetts General Hospital. Mice were anesthetized by 2%

isofluorane (Baxter) mixed with oxygen and innoculated with
5  106 SNU638 cells (in 0.2 mL PBS) subcutaneously into the
lower left side of quadrant. Once the tumor size was 500
mm3, the mice were treated with either PF-2341066 (25 mg/
kg/d) or vehicle by oral gavage. Mouse weight and tumor size
were measured 3 times per week.

Results
Resistant clones maintain PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and
TORC1 signaling in the presence of MET inhibitors
SNU638 is a gastric carcinoma cell line that is addicted to
MET signaling and thus highly sensitive to MET inhibitors
(Fig. 1A; ref. 8). Not surprisingly, it expresses MET to levels
comparable with cells harboring MET amplification (e.g.,
EBC1, HCC827 GR5, H1993; refs. 8, 15; Supplementary
Fig. S1). We grew SNU638 cells in increasing concentrations
of the PHA-665752 until cells were able to grow in medium
containing 1 mmol/L PHA-665752, a dose previously shown to
potently inhibit MET signaling and markedly decrease cell
viability in cancers addicted to MET signaling but is not toxic
to MET-independent lines (7, 8, 11). Subclones (A1, A2, A3, C1,
C2, and B1) derived from single cells of the resistant cell line
showed marked resistance (Fig. 1A). Clones A1 and C1 were
utilized for further analyses.
To determine whether the resistant clones had aberrant
activation of RTKs, we assessed the activation status of
multiple RTKs with human phospho-RTK arrays. In contrast
to the parental sensitive cell line, the A1-resistant cells
maintained MET and EGFR phosphorylation in the presence
of PHA-665752. The C1 cells maintained only EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 1B and C). In addition, unlike the parental
sensitive cell line, drug treatment failed to substantially
downregulate pAKT, pERK, or pS6 in either of the resistant
clones (Fig. 1C).
TGFa-dependent activation of EGFR induces resistance
To determine how EGFR was being activated in the C1resistant cells, we measured the expression levels of the EGFR
ligands by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR).
Of all the growth factors tested (including EGF, TGFa, amphiregulin, betacellulin, HB-EGF, and epiregulin), only TGFa RNA
levels were dramatically increased (13; Fig. 2A, left, and
Supplementary Fig. S2). There was also marked elevation of
TGFa protein in the supernatant of resistant cells (Fig. 2A,
right). To determine whether TGFa is sufficient to promote
resistance, we added recombinant TGFa to parental SNU638
and MKN45 cells (an independent MET-addicted cancer cell
line). We observed that exogenous TGFa was indeed sufficient
to promote marked resistance to MET inhibition, but resistance was overcome by combined inhibition of MET and
EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Although neither single-agent
MET inhibitors nor single-agent EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib or
PF-00299804) substantially blocked EGFR phosphorylation in
C1 cells, combined EGFR and MET inhibition was more
effective (Fig. 2B), suggesting that EGFR phosphorylation is
due to both cross-talk with MET and TGFa-induced activation. Interestingly, EGFR inhibitors alone diminished ERK and

S6 phosphorylation, but not AKT phosphorylation, in C1 cells,
suggesting that these cells undergo a "rewiring" in which EGFR
signaling is the primary, independent driver of the ERK pathway. These findings were consistent with the observation that
exogenous TGFa maintained phosphorylation of ERK and S6
in SNU638 and MKN45 cells treated with PHA-665752 but had
only a modest effect on AKT phosphorylation (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Although EGFR inhibition alone had a moderate
impact on C1 cell viability (possibly due to its regulation of
ERK; Supplementary Fig. S4), EGFR inhibition potently resensitized the cells to the effects of MET inhibition and overcame
resistance (Fig. 2C, top).
Somatic MET Y1230H mutation results in drug
resistance in A1 cells
Unlike the C1-resistant clone, the A1-resistant clone was
not sensitive to combined EGFR and MET inhibition
(Fig. 2C, bottom). Furthermore, they were resistant to 2
independent MET inhibitors, PHA-665752 (IC50 ¼ 1.72
mmol/L vs. 13.2 nmol/L parental cells) and PF-2341066

C

(IC50 ¼ 1.66 mmol/L vs. 2.42 nmol/L parental cells; Fig. 3A).
Of note, the previous phospho-RTK arrays and Western blots
revealed that a small amount of MET tyrosine phosphorylation persisted despite MET inhibitor treatment (Fig. 1B and C).
Sequencing of the MET gene revealed the presence of a new
mutation in the resistant cells (Fig. 3B). This mutation
resulted in a change from a tyrosine to a histidine unit at
position 1,230 (Y1230H). This mutation was further confirmed
by sequencing individual bacterial colonies transformed with
the MET RT-PCR product from the A1 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5). This mutation was not detectable in cDNA from
parental cells (Fig. 3B).
These findings suggested that a mutation in MET may have
led to resistance, analogous to resistance mutations observed
in EGFR and ABL when cancers become resistant to gefitinib/
erlotinib and imatinib, respectively. To determine whether the
resistant A1 cells still required MET expression for their
resistance, we assessed the effects of MET knockdown on
cell viability. Knockdown of MET with 2 independent shRNAs
effectively reduced viability of the A1 cells in a manner similar

to that of the parental cells, showing their continued dependence on MET expression (Supplementary Fig. S6). In contrast, the C1 cells were not sensitive to MET knockdown
(Supplementary Fig. S6). This was anticipated, as the C1 cells
were resistant to MET inhibitors due to ligand-dependent
activation of EGFR signaling. To confirm that the deleterious
effects of MET shRNA on the A1 cells were specifically due to
MET knockdown, MET expression was rescued with a lentivirus expressing an MET cDNA resistant to the knockdown
induced by one of the shRNA constructs [which targets the 30
untranslated region (UTR) of MET RNA]. As shown in Fig. 3 C
and D, MET expression rescued the cells from the effects of

MET shRNA. Furthermore, expression of the MET Y1230H
mutant was capable of rescuing the parental cells from the
effects of MET knockdown. Thus, the A1 cells are resistant to
MET inhibitors but are sensitive to MET knockdown, consistent with the notion that resistance is driven by the newly
identified MET mutation that results in incomplete inhibition
of the MET kinase activity. In addition, the A1 cells were
rescued by wild-type (wt) MET because the A1 cells rely on
MET signaling for survival and this could be supplied by wt
MET. As expected, wt MET was sufficient to rescue viability, as
these experiments were not carried out in the presence of the
MET inhibitor.

KD) or targeting the MET 3’ UTR (MET KD) and then selected by puromycin. Expression of ERBB3, MET, and actin was detected by Western blot
analysis. ERBB3 levels were measured as a control to show that MET knockdown did not have an off-target effect on other RTKs. Note that MET often appears
as 2 bands. The upper band is pro-MET, the form before proteolysis (34). D, the resulting cells as in (C) were infected by lentivirus encoding control or

expressing Y1230H maintained MET phosphorylation as well
as downstream signaling in the presence of PHA-665752,
indicating that the Y1230H is sufficient to induce resistance
to the MET inhibitors.
To determine whether MET Y1230H activates PI3K by the
same molecular mechanisms as wt MET, we conducted PI3K
immunoprecipitations that identify the adaptors leading to
PI3K membrane recruitment and activation (8, 14, 16). We
found that the parental and MET-overexpressing cells utilized
ERBB3 and GAB2, but unlike the control cells and those
overexpressing wt MET, the MET Y1230H cells maintained
interactions with GAB2 and ERBB3 despite treatment with
PHA-665752 (Supplementary Fig. S7A), consistent with the
inability of the MET inhibitor to fully inhibit MET and downregulate PI3K-AKT signaling in these cells (Fig. 4C). Of note,
we observed that exogenous expression of the Y1230H mutant

1086

was sufficient to induce resistance in two other MET addicted
cell lines, EBC1 (non-small cell lung cancer) and MKN45
(gastric; ref. 7; Supplementary Fig. S8).
Development of resistant mutations in vivo
We also determined how SNU638 cells developed resistance
to MET inhibition in vivo. SNU638 cells were subcutaneously
injected into nude mice. Once the tumors were 500 mm3, PF2341066 was administered daily by oral gavage. Compared
with the control mouse treated with vehicle alone, PF-2341066
resulted in tumor regression for 3 to 4 weeks before resistance
developed (Fig. 5A). This resistant tumor was harvested at
day 46 of treatment and used for establishing the cell line M1
(Mouse1).
We observed that the M1 cells maintained resistance to PHA665752 and PF-2341066 in vitro (Fig. 5B). MET phosphorylation

(as well as intracellular PI3K, ERK, and TORC1 signaling) was
maintained in the M1 cells after treatment with 1 mmol/L PHA665752 (Fig. 5C) similar to the A1 cells described earlier.
Furthermore, these cells maintained the association between
PI3K and ERBB3 and GAB proteins despite treatment with the
MET inhibitor similarly to the cells overexpressing MET Y1230H
(Supplementary Fig. S7A and B).
Assessment of both the in vivo resistant tumor and the
derived M1 cell line identified mutations in Tyr1230 (Fig. 5D)
that were not detected in the parental cell line and untreated
xenograft tumors. Assessment of single clones of cDNA isolated from the M1 cell lined showed 2 different mutations in
Tyr1230 in the resistant cancers Y1230H (TAT ! CAT) and
Y1230C (TAT ! TGT). We derived cell lines from single-cell
clones from the M1 cell line and assessed 15 of the derived
clones. Three clones had no mutations in MET (wt/wt), 9
harbored MET Y1230H mutations, and 3 harbored Y1230C
mutations (Fig. 5E). All of the clones harboring mutations in
MET maintained resistance to PHA-665752 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S9A). Of interest, clones without mutant MET
maintained sensitivity to PHA-665752, suggesting that, in vivo,
they may have been resistant via non–cell autonomous
mechanisms. Of note, we measured TGFa by RT-PCR in
the resistant xenograft and the derived wt/wt cells, and we
did not observe any increase in RNA abundance (Supplementary Fig. S9B and C). However, because most of the cells in the
resistant tumor harbored a mutation in Y1230, it is unclear
whether substantial increases in TGFa would be detected in
total tumor RNA even if TGFa were driving resistance in this
minor population. Thus, it is possible that stromal interactions may have promoted the viability of those wt/wt cells in
vivo. In conclusion, these in vivo studies confirmed that MET
Y1230H or Y1230C mutations might be sufficient to cause

A

autonomous drug resistance. Furthermore, these findings
show that some of the resistant mechanisms observed in vitro
were recapitulated in vivo and that a single cell line has the
capacity to give rise to multiple resistance mechanisms in vitro
and in vivo.
The crystal structure of the MET tyrosine kinase
domain bound to PHA-665752 reveals the role of Y1230
A crystal structure of PHA-665752 bound to the kinase
domain of MET (PDB entry ¼ 2WKM) was determined.
PHA-665752 binds to an autoinhibitory conformation of
MET in which the beginning of the kinase activation loop
forms a turn that is inserted between a-helix C and the Nterminal domain b-sheet (Fig. 6A). In this conformation,
a-helix C is displaced from a catalytically competent orientation and the position of the activation loop prevents the
binding of substrates. As bound to MET, the conformation
of PHA-665752 is C-shaped, as has been observed for other
class I MET inhibitors including PF-2341066 (17, 18). Activation loop residue Tyr1230 makes an aromatic stacking interaction with the dichlorophenyl ring of PHA-665752 (Fig. 6B).
Tyr1230 also seems to be an important residue in stabilizing
the unique activation loop conformation, as its hydroxyl is
involved in a hydrogen-bonding network with Ala1226 and the
side chain of Lys1110, which is also positioned to hydrogen
bond with Asp1228. One explanation for the diminished
inhibitory activity of PHA-665752 toward the Y1230H mutant
MET is that the substitution of histidine for tyrosine at residue
1,230 results in decreased binding of PHA-665752 because of a
weaker stacking interaction of the smaller histidine imidazole
ring (vs. the tyrosine phenol) with the dichlorophenyl ring of
PHA-665752 (Fig. 6B). Loss of direct favorable interactions
with PHA-665752 and other class I inhibitors may be even

Resistance Mechanisms to MET Inhibitors

greater for the Y1230C mutation than for the Y1230H mutation
due to the nonaromaticity and smaller size of the sulfydryl side
chain.
Another contributing factor to the inhibitor resistance of
the Y1230H/C mutations may be that the substitutions at
position 1,230 destabilize the autoinhibitory conformation of
the activation loop and change the protein conformational
equilibrium in the direction of a catalytically active conformation. Modeling of histidine or cysteine at position 1,230 reveal
that they would not be able to form the same stabilizing
hydrogen bonding network observed with Tyr1230 (Fig. 6B).
Loss of this hydrogen bonding network as well as the impact of
the smaller side chains not completely filling the space of the
tyrosine likely destabilize the autoinhibitory conformation. It
is therefore likely that acquired resistance mutations at position 1,230 may also be discovered with other class I MET
inhibitors that bind to this autoinhibitory conformation of
MET and make a direct interaction with Tyr1230.

Discussion
The deflating realization that cancers become resistant to
effective targeted therapies has spurred great interest in
determining how cancers become resistant so that we can
identify more effective strategies to induce more durable
remissions. In this study, we examined resistance to MET
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). To our surprise, using a single
cell line, SNU638, we observed multiple mechanisms by which
these cells became resistant to MET inhibitors. Some clones
became resistant by activating the EGFR through autocrine
production of ligand, whereas other clones acquired novel
mutations in amino acid 1,230 that conferred resistance. These
results were recapitulated by developing resistance models in
vivo as well. The finding that a single plate of 1 million cells and
a small subcentimeter tumor in vivo can simultaneously
develop multiple mechanisms of resistance highlights the
notion that patients with cancers consisting of billions to
trillions of cells have the capacity to simultaneously develop
a wide array of resistance mechanisms. This will continue to
challenge our capacity to strategically reinduce remissions.
Resistance to other targeted therapies including EGFR and
ABL inhibitors has been associated with the development of
secondary mutations that abrogate TKI inhibition. The most
common mutation that develops after treatment with EGFR
kinase inhibitors is EGFR T790M (19, 20), and a common one
after treatment with imatinib is ABL T315I (21–23). Both
mutations are located in an analogous position in the kinase
domain and have been termed "gatekeeper" mutations. In this
study, we identified mutations in Y1230 as an acquired resistance mechanism to class I MET inhibitors. The occasional
existence of MET Y1230 mutations in pretreatment cancers
(24) is analogous to the observations that some lung cancers
and leukemias harbor EGFR T790M and ABL T315I, respectively, prior to treatment (25, 26). In the case of MET, this is
likely related because of increased MET activity conferred by
the Y1230 mutation. Indeed, the structural analyses (Fig. 6)
suggest that mutation destabilizes the autoinhibitory confirmation. This is supported by the finding that MET Y1230H has

www.aacrjournals.org

increased catalytic activity in vitro (18) and has transforming
activity in vivo (27).
The MET Y1230H mutation is located in the activation loop
of the enzyme. Structural analyses suggest that the substitution of Y1230 with histidine or cysteine has a lower affinity
with PF-2341066 and PHA-665752. Indeed, these results are
supported by previous in vitro kinase assays showing that
these compounds have decreased inhibitory activity toward
MET Y1230H as compared with wt MET in enzymatic and
cellular assays (18). Although these and other class I MET
inhibitors seem to have decreased activity against MET
Y1230H (28), there have recently been reports of class II
MET inhibitors that can potently inhibit Y1230H (29, 30).
Theoretically, such inhibitors will effectively treat these
Y1230 mutant resistant cancers. Moreover, these inhibitors
might prevent the acquisition of Y1230 mutations as a resistant mechanism.
Recent studies suggest that "pulse dosing" may permit one
to overcome resistance and effectively treat oncogeneaddicted cancers with targeted therapies (31). Indeed, we
observed that very high levels of PF-2341066 (10 mmol/L)
could potently suppress MET in Y1230 mutant cells (Supplementary Fig. S10A). Although this dose was capable of inhibiting growth of SNU638 parental cells after only 1 hour of
exposure, the resistant M1 cells required 24 hours of highdose exposure (Supplementary Fig. S10B). Of note, previous
studies found that mice could tolerate 50 mg/kg dosage level
and plasma levels achieved concentrations of 2 mmol/L (32).
Although it remains unknown if mice, or more important,
humans, could tolerate doses required to provide sufficient
target inhibition of Y1230 mutants, the marked decrease in
potency against the resistant mutant (300- to 1,000-fold)
suggests that newer MET inhibitors that can effectively target
Y1230H may ultimately be a more effective clinical strategy.
In addition, we observed that activation of EGFR induced
resistance to MET inhibitors. Of note, we had previously
observed the reciprocal finding that MET activation is one
mechanism of resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancers treated
with EGFR TKIs (8, 11). In this study, we found that SNU638
cells adapt to MET inhibition by overexpressing the EGFR
ligand TGFa to promote resistance. Similarly, another study
showed that exogenous addition of other growth factors (EGF
and heregulin) rescued MET-driven cells (GTL-16 and
MKN45) from MET inhibition (33); however, that report did
not identify upregulation of ligand as a naturally occurring
resistance mechanism. Both the C1-resistant cells and the
cells treated with exogenous TGFa show that ligand-dependent activation of EGFR strongly maintained ERK signaling,
but its effects on PI3K signaling were more modest. Importantly, EGFR inhibition resensitized these cells to MET inhibition. Because tumor stroma can secrete TGFa in vivo, cancers
may acquire resistance by autocrine- or paracrine-derived
sources.
In addition to SNU638 cell line, we also aimed to determine
how other MET-addicted cancer models would develop resistance. We recently developed resistant clones from EBC1 cells
in vitro (designated 1A, 7A, and 4B) by the same procedure
that generated the SNU638-resistant cells (Supplementary

Fig. S11A). These resistant clones do not seem to share the
same resistance mechanisms identified in the SNU638 cells.
Unlike the C1 cells, they were not sensitive to PHA-665752 plus
gefitinib combination treatment (Supplementary Fig. S11B).
There were also no observed resistant mutations in the kinase
domain (Supplementary Fig. S11C), MET phosphorylation was
fully suppressed by MET inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S11D),
and they were insensitive to MET knockdown by MET shRNA
(Supplementary Fig. S11E). Although the mechanism is
unknown, these studies do reveal that there will be additional
mechanisms of acquired resistance to MET inhibitors. However, the Y1230H/C point mutations identified in the SNU638
cells may ultimately prove to be a highly prevalent resistance
mechanism to class I MET inhibitors. Indeed, acquired point
mutations in drug targets have been a commonly observed
resistance mechanism in other targeted therapy paradigms as
well (e.g., EGFR T790M and ABL T315I).
In summary, our data suggest that even a single cell line in
vitro can develop more than one type of mechanism to become
drug resistant. Indeed, we find evidence of both acquired
mutations in MET and the upregulation of EGFR ligand to
promote resistance. As cancers become resistant to the "Cshaped" MET inhibitors in the clinic, it will be important to
assess for these resistance mechanisms in patients. Indeed,
the therapeutic strategies that combine MET inhibitors cap-

able of inhibiting Y1230 mutant MET in combination with
anti-EGFR–based therapies may translate into enhanced clinical benefit for patients.
