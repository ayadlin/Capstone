Many different types of cancer show a high incidence of TP53 mutations, leading to the expression of mutant
p53 proteins. There is growing evidence that these mutant p53s have both lost wild-type p53 tumor suppressor activity and gained functions that help to contribute to malignant progression. Understanding the functions of mutant p53 will help in the development of new therapeutic approaches that may be useful in a broad
range of cancer types.

p53 is one of the most intensively studied tumor suppressor proteins, with mutations that lead to loss of wild-type p53 activity
frequently detected in many different tumor types. Perturbations
in p53 signaling pathways are believed to be required for the
development of most cancers, and there is evidence to suggest
that restoration or reactivation of p53 function will have significant therapeutic benefit. For the first 10 years of investigation,
p53 was considered to be the product of an oncogene, with
many studies describing proliferative and transforming activities
for p53. This mistake in the initial classification of p53 was the
result of a simple error; the TP53 gene that had been cloned
and used in the initial experiments encoded a mutant version
of the wild-type gene. The tumor suppressor credentials of
wild-type p53 are no longer in doubt, but the early studies provided a tantalizing hint of what has become an extremely active
area of study—the suggestion that mutations in p53 can result in
both loss of wild-type activity and gain of a novel transforming
function. Moving in a circle in the past 30 years, we have come
back around to considering that p53, albeit mutant versions of
p53, can function as oncoproteins. In this review, we highlight
recent progress in our understanding of how mutant p53 functions, discuss the avenues that are being explored to target
mutant p53 tumors, and explore future directions for mutant
p53 research.
TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer
(Kandoth et al., 2013). Alterations have been found in virtually
every region of the protein (Leroy et al., 2013), but only a handful
of the most frequently occurring mutations have been studied in
depth for their contribution to cancer progression. In some
cases, frameshift or nonsense mutations result in the loss of
p53 protein expression, as seen with other tumor suppressors.
However, more frequently, the tumor-associated alterations in
p53 result in missense mutations, leading to the substitution of
a single amino acid in the p53 protein that can be stably expressed in the tumor cell. These substitutions occur throughout
the p53 protein, but most commonly cluster within the DNA binding region of p53, with six ‘‘hotspot’’ amino acids that are most
frequently substituted. These mutations generally lead to a loss

or diminution of the wild-type activity of p53, and because p53
normally acts as a tetramer, these mutant proteins may also
function as dominant negative inhibitors over any remaining
wild-type p53. Indeed, in a mouse model, the expression of
mutant p53 has been shown to dampen (but not prevent) the
therapeutic response to restoration of wild-type p53 (Wang
et al., 2011). However, it is becoming clear that at least some
of these mutant p53 proteins give rise to a more aggressive tumor profile, indicating that they have acquired novel functions
in promoting tumorigenesis.
Gain of Function of Mutant p53
The concept that mutant p53 may show a neomorphic gain of
function (GOF) was first suggested 20 years ago (Dittmer et al.,
1993), when the introduction of mutant p53 into p53 null cells
was shown to give rise to a new phenotype. Since then, a large
number of publications have demonstrated many GOFs in
numerous cell lines with a variety of p53 mutations, summarized
in Table 1. The GOF acquired by mutant p53 is further supported
by the finding that patients carrying a TP53 missense mutation
(leading to expression of a mutant p53 protein) in the germline
have a significantly earlier cancer onset than patients with mutations in TP53 that result in loss of p53 protein expression (Bougeard et al., 2008; Zerdoumi et al., 2013). Consistently, in vivo
experiments showed that mice expressing mutant p53 display
a tumor profile that is more aggressive and metastatic than
p53 null or p53 wild-type mice (Doyle et al., 2010; Lang et al.,
2004; Morton et al., 2010; Olive et al., 2004), although some tissue specificity of this effect has been suggested by further
studies showing that introduction of similar p53 mutations in
the lung did not reveal any detectable GOF activity over p53
loss (Jackson et al., 2005). Nevertheless, numerous in vitro and
xenograft models have confirmed the ability of mutant p53s to
drive enhanced invasion and motility, with evidence that mutant
p53 can enhance signaling through receptors such as transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and MET (Adorno et al., 2009; Grugan et al., 2013; Muller
et al., 2009, 2012; Sauer et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013a). In part,

The different cellular processes in which mutant p53 has been shown to play a role are indicated. Literature was selected based on the following search
criteria in Pubmed: ‘‘Mutant p53’’ and ‘‘Gain of Function’’ or ‘‘Mutant p53’’ and ‘‘acquired functions.’’ Only studies in which a clear gain of function effect
was shown are included (i.e., mutant p53 compared to a p53 null in the same cell line). These comprise studies in which mutant p53 was overexpressed
in a p53 null cell line and compared to a vector control, or studies in which endogenous mutant p53 was knocked down or knocked out compared to
control cells. Studies describing the activity of mutant p53 in cells that express wild-type p53 are not included to avoid complications from possible
dominant negative effects. Indicated are the different mutations, cell lines, endogenous expression, or stable/transient transfection, and the references. The studies in this table were manually selected from >400 publications and we apologize to those authors whose papers we have inadvertently
missed.
a
Increased (altered) migration comprises wound scratch assays, scattering, migration in three-dimensional culture conditions, and Boyden chamber
migration (frequently referred to as transwell invasion without addition of a matrix such as Matrigel).
b
Cells were depleted for endogenous wild-type p53 expression.
c
These are T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and therefore increased hematological disease rather than promoted lung metastases.
d
H1299 cells expressing p53 R175H promoted the angiogenesis of HUVEC cells.

these responses reflect an ability of mutant p53 to promote integrin/RCP driven recycling (Muller et al., 2009, 2012) or increase
the expression of growth factor receptors (Sauer et al., 2010;
Wang et al., 2013a). Although mutant p53s have generally lost
the ability to bind consensus p53 DNA binding regions in target
gene promoters, their activity appears to reflect an ability to
regulate gene expression directly (Weisz et al., 2007), although
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial activities of mutant p53 in regulating apoptosis and autophagy have also been described
(Chee et al., 2013; Frank et al., 2011; Morselli et al., 2008).
Whereas various different mutant p53s can bind directly to
DNA with some degree of selectivity (Brázdová et al., 2013; Göhler et al., 2005; Quante et al., 2012) and may thereby directly control the transcription of some genes (Weisz et al., 2007), there is
increasing evidence that an indirect effect on gene expression
through binding to other transcription factors underlies the novel
activities of mutant p53s. For example, several studies have revealed a role for TAp63, a p53 family protein and transcription
factor, which interacts with mutant but not wild-type p53 (Gaiddon et al., 2001; Strano et al., 2002). By inhibiting TAp63, mutant
p53 can regulate a pro-invasive transcription program that includes regulation of the expression of Dicer, DEPDC1, Cyclin
G2, and Sharp1 (Adorno et al., 2009; Girardini et al., 2011). The
Dicer regulation by mutant p53 may be of particular importance,
because several miRNAs that can in turn regulate genes involved
in invasion have been described to be regulated by mutant p53,
although this may not always involve TAp63 or Dicer inhibition
(Dong et al., 2012; Neilsen et al., 2012; Tucci et al., 2012;
Wang et al., 2013a).
Mutant p53 inhibition of TAp63 can be modeled by deletion of
TAp63, which results in an aggressive tumor profile and metastases similar to that seen in mice expressing mutant p53 (Su
et al., 2010). However, a direct comparison of mutant p53
expression with loss of TAp63 in a mouse model of pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) showed that loss of TAp63 is
less potent in inducing metastases, suggesting that mutant
p53 does more than inhibiting TAp63 (Tan et al., 2013). This is
308 Cancer Cell 25, March 17, 2014 ª2014 The Authors

not surprising, because mutant p53 interacts with a wide variety
of other proteins, resulting in interference in a multitude of
cellular pathways, some of which are likely to contribute to
metastasis (Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012; Muller and Vousden,
2013; Walerych et al., 2012). Besides inhibiting p63, mutant p53
inhibits and interacts with other proteins including the MRE11Rad51-NSB complex, p73, and SP-1 to induce genomic instability, chemoresistance, or proliferation (Chicas et al., 2000;
Gaiddon et al., 2001; Song et al., 2007). Furthermore, mutant
p53 can also promote the function of proteins including SREBP,
NF-Y, VDR, ETS2, or NRF2, resulting in increased proliferation,
cholesterol synthesis, accumulation of reactive oxygen species,
and enhanced cell survival (Do et al., 2012; Freed-Pastor et al.,
2012; Kalo et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2011; Stambolsky et al.,
2010). All of these proteins and pathways affected by mutant
p53 are thoroughly described in three recent reviews (FreedPastor and Prives, 2012; Muller and Vousden, 2013; Walerych
et al., 2012).
More recent studies are identifying further GOF activities of
mutant p53, such as a role in cell reprogramming and expansion
or in the maintenance and interaction with tumor stroma. Wildtype p53 was characterized as a suppressor of somatic stem
cell reprogramming, the process in which differentiated somatic
cells can be reprogrammed into a pluripotent stem cell to allow
for unlimited expansion (Kawamura et al., 2009; Marión et al.,
2009). Loss of p53 promoted the dedifferentiation of somatic
cells and some, but not all, mutant p53s could potentiate the reprogramming (Sarig et al., 2010; Yi et al., 2012). An expansion of
hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cell progenitors is also
seen in mutant p53 R248Q transgenic mice (Hanel et al., 2013).
Consistently, in breast tissue with a Wnt transgene, loss of
wild-type p53 generally promoted the formation of one distinct
tumor, whereas mutant p53 R175H expression promoted the
initiation of multiple different tumors that could be expanded in
mammosphere assays (Lu et al., 2013). Together, these data
suggest that mutant p53 can initiate tumor formation by promoting the generation and expansion of pluripotent stem cells.

The role of stroma tissue, including extracellular matrix, proteases, cytokines, immune cells, epithelial cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in tumorigenesis has become very
evident (Pietras and Ostman, 2010). CAFs, the most abundant
cell type in the stroma, secrete cytokines, hormones, and growth
factors including hepatocyte growth factor and TGF-b (Bhowmick et al., 2004; Ostman and Augsten, 2009), both of which
have been shown to mediate mutant p53-dependent invasion
and metastasis (Adorno et al., 2009; Muller et al., 2012). In addition, a recent report highlights an important function for mutant
p53 in promoting the inflammatory environment of colorectal tumors by prolonging NF-kB activation and cell survival (Cooks
et al., 2013). It seems clear, therefore, that the presence of a
mutant p53 in tumor cells will have an influence on how the tumor
and stromal cells interact. In co-culture experiments, H1299 cells
(regardless of p53 status) upregulated interferon-b (IFN-b) secretion in CAFs. This would normally cause inhibition of cell migration, but mutant p53-expressing tumor cells counteracted this
response by enhancing STAT phosphorylation to promote invasion (Madar et al., 2013). Although interesting, these experiments are difficult to interpret, because the IFN-b secreted by
the fibroblasts also reduced mutant p53 expression (Madar
et al., 2013). Alternatively, it is possible that TP53 mutations
occur in the stroma surrounding tumors to promote tumor
growth (Narendran et al., 2003; Patocs et al., 2007). Mutant
p53-expressing fibroblasts were shown to promote tumor
growth better than p53 null fibroblasts, suggesting that mutant
p53 has a pro-oncogenic GOF role not only in tumor cells, but
also in stromal cells (Addadi et al., 2010). However, whether stromal cells that have sustained mutations in p53 are prevalent, and
how they are affected by (or affect) tumor cells remains unclear.
Are All Mutant p53s the Same?
Although most experimental studies have focused on the activity
of a few most commonly detected p53 mutations that are clustered at codons 175, 245, 248, 249, 273, and 282, almost every
codon within the DNA binding domain of p53 has been found to
be mutated in cancer. Mutations have also been found in other
domains, but their contribution to carcinogenesis is largely unknown (Leroy et al., 2013). Different tumor types show different
spectra of TP53 mutations—in some cases, reflecting the mutagenic event was thought to contribute to that type of cancer (e.g.,
aflatoxin and liver, UV light, and skin) or geographic variation in
other cases. The frequency of missense mutations also differs
in different subclasses of tumors of the same organ. For
example, luminal breast cancers almost all carry point mutations
in TP53, while alterations resulting in p53 truncations were more
frequently detected in basal breast tumors (Dumay et al., 2013).
Whereas p53 mutants are often considered to be equivalent,
evidence is accumulating to indicate that different mutants
show a distinct profile with respect to loss of wild-type p53 activity, the ability to inhibit wild-type p53, and the acquisition of gain
of function (Table 1; Halevy et al., 1990; Petitjean et al., 2007).
The large number of p53 mutations complicates such analyses,
as does the realization that different mutants may function differently in different tissues, potentially reflecting differences in the
expression of targets of mutant p53 such as TAp63. To date,
mutant p53s have been considered in two different categories:
the first affecting amino acids that contact DNA and so pre-

venting wild-type transcriptional activity without dramatically
affecting the conformation of the p53 protein (known as contact
mutants), and the second comprising mutations that clearly
disrupt the three-dimensional structure of the protein (termed
conformational mutants). Data from cell lines suggest that
conformational and contact mutants can cooperate via different
mechanisms with the H-Ras signaling pathway, leading to similar
gene expression profiles and tumorigenesis (Solomon et al.,
2012). However, this classification of mutants is clearly an oversimplification, because different mutations can lead to subtly
different alterations in the structure and conformational stability
of the p53 protein (Joerger and Fersht, 2007). Various mouse
models have shown that both conformational and contact mutants can promote metastasis compared to p53 null mice. These
differences appear to be dependent on the nature of the substitution, but caution should be taken when interpreting data from
mouse models using different strain backgrounds that are being
studied in different laboratories, and in some cases mutate the
mouse gene and in others examine humanized TP53 sequences
in the mouse. Models of R172H or R270H (prototype examples
of a conformation and a contact hotspot mutation, equivalent
to R175H and R273H in humans) both showed GOF activity
(Lang et al., 2004; Olive et al., 2004), whereas no GOF was
seen in R246S (the mouse equivalent of human R249S) and the
humanized G245S mutant p53 mouse models, although the
R246S could dominant-negatively inhibit wild-type p53 to promote cell survival after radiation exposure (Hanel et al., 2013;
Lee et al., 2012). R248Q (humanized) p53 knock-in mice showed
an earlier onset of tumor formation with a significantly reduced
lifespan compared to p53 null mice (Hanel et al., 2013), although
this reduction in overall survival was not evident in any of the
other mutant p53 models. Consistently, Li-Fraumeni patients
carrying an R248Q mutation display an earlier onset of cancer
compared to inherited null mutations or the G245S mutation (Hanel et al., 2013). These findings suggest that the R248Q p53
functions in a different manner than other p53 mutants that
have been studied so far. Remarkably, not only the position of
the mutation, but also the nature of the substitution may influence the activity of the resulting mutant protein. For example,
both R248Q and R248W are structural mutants, but the
humanized R248W p53 knock-in mouse does not display
reduced lifespan or earlier disease onset (Song et al., 2007). Understanding the consequences of each p53 mutation in relationship to disease progression and response to therapy therefore
promises to be an extremely complex undertaking.
Consequences of Mutant p53 Expression to Tumor
Therapy
The realization that loss of p53 and expression of mutant p53
may not be analogous has also raised the question of whether
the presence of a mutant p53 protein may affect the response
to therapy. Whereas there is evidence that the presence of
mutant p53 may dampen the response to restoration of wildtype p53 (Wang et al., 2011), reflecting a dominant negative
activity of mutant p53, more recent studies have indicated that
the retention of wild-type p53 can be detrimental to the therapeutic response in breast cancer. This effect is seen in tumors
that express both mutant and wild-type p53 alleles (Jackson
et al., 2012). Such studies highlight the possibility that in some

Figure 1. Strategies that Are Currently Being Explored to Target Mutant p53
Depicted in red are schematics of the strategies that are currently being explored to target p53 mutant-expressing cancers. These strategies include promotion of
mutant p53 degradation through the proteasome and autophagy pathways, restoration of wild-type p53 activity, interference with the interaction between mutant
p53 and other proteins, and interference in signaling pathways downstream of mutant p53.

tumor types wild-type p53 can be dominant over mutant, and
that studies of patient response based on p53 status must
take into account heterozygosity at the TP53 locus, as well as
the presence of mutant or wild-type p53 (Jackson and Lozano,
2013).
Therapeutic Strategies to Restore Wild-Type Activity to
Mutant p53
With so many different mutations and phenotypes it is not surprising that a variety of strategies are being explored to target
tumors expressing mutant p53s (summarized in Figure 1).
Wild-type p53 is a potent inducer of apoptosis and senescence
when expressed in tumor cells, making the reactivation of some
level of wild-type function in mutant p53 (which is generally expressed at high levels in cancer cells) an attractive therapeutic
avenue. Interestingly, loss of wild-type function introduced by
some destabilizing tumor-derived mutations can be rescued by
additional point mutations that serve to stabilize the conformation of p53 protein, showing that the loss of structure is intrinsically reversible (Joerger and Fersht, 2008). In addition, a variety
of compounds that might restore wild-type p53 function have
been characterized and are reviewed in several recent publications (Lehmann and Pietenpol, 2012; Maslon and Hupp, 2010;
Wiman, 2010). Small molecules that bind to a site in p53 formed
in the Y220C mutant (PhiKan083 and PK7088) function by stabilizing the structure of this mutant p53, and so increasing the level
of p53 with a wild-type conformation and activity (Boeckler et al.,
310 Cancer Cell 25, March 17, 2014 ª2014 The Authors

2008; Liu et al., 2013). Other compounds bind to multiple mutant
p53 proteins (e.g., PRIMA-1, or the soluble derivative PRIMAmet/APR-246, CP-31398, and SCH29074; Bykov et al., 2002;
Demma et al., 2010; Foster et al., 1999), interacting with the
DNA binding domain, thereby promoting proper folding of
the mutant protein and restoration of p53 function. However,
the precise mechanistic function of these compounds and
others, such as maleimide analogs and STIMA-1, remain to be
elucidated (Bykov et al., 2005; Zache et al., 2008).
Whereas wild-type p53 requires binding to the metal ion
Zn(2+) to fold correctly (Loh, 2010; Verhaegh et al., 1998), the
R175H p53 mutant was found to be impaired in zinc binding
(Butler and Loh, 2003). Loss of metallothioneins that chelate
and store intracellular zinc promotes a wild-type conformation
of misfolded p53 (Puca et al., 2009) and addition of zinc to the
conformational mutants G245C and G245D p53 partially
restored the wild-type conformation (Pintus et al., 2013). The
potential use of zinc to recover wild-type folding has therefore
been explored and this approach has been shown to restore
chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs in cells expressing endogenous mutant p53 (Puca et al., 2011). In addition, the thiosemicarbazone metal ion chelator NSC31926 was found to restore
wild-type function in a variety of different mutant p53-expressing
cell lines, possibly through increasing the bioavailability of zinc to
(mutant) p53 (Yu et al., 2012).
Of all the compounds that restore wild-type activity, the
most progress has been made with PRIMA-1 analogs, with the

Cancer Cell

demonstration of safety in a phase I clinical study (Lehmann
et al., 2012). PRIMA-1 is rapidly converted to other compounds,
including MQ, which can bind to both mutant p53 and wild-type
p53 (Lambert et al., 2009), although the precise mechanisms
underlying the p53 reactivation are currently unknown. Under
some circumstances, p53 can adopt an unfolded conformation
and behave like a mutant p53 protein to promote invasion (Trinidad et al., 2013). Unfolded wild-type p53 seen in tumor cells
grown under hypoxia (Gogna et al., 2012) could be restored by
PRIMA-1 treatment (Rieber and Strasberg-Rieber, 2012). It will
therefore be interesting to explore whether both wild-type and
mutant p53 tumors might benefit from PRIMA-1 treatment.
Therapeutic Strategies to Promote Mutant p53
Degradation
An alternative approach to targeting mutant p53 is to remove the
proteins by enhancing turnover (Figure 1). Both wild-type and
mutant p53 can be targeted for proteasomal degradation in
otherwise normal cells by the ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Inhibition
of MDM2 in response to stress underlies the activation of wildtype p53, but is also thought to lead to the overexpression of
mutant p53 seen in cancer cells. Indeed, stress induced stabilization of mutant p53 seems to be a prerequisite for its GOF (Suh
et al., 2011). In addition to MDM2, another chaperone-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, was shown to be important for
mutant p53 degradation (Esser et al., 2005; Lukashchuk and
Vousden, 2007). To be stabilized, mutant p53 interacts with the
Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperone complex that requires an interaction with HDAC6 for proper functioning (Li et al., 2011b). Abrogation of HDAC6 binding results in the dissociation of the heat
shock proteins from mutant p53 and allows for mutant p53
degradation by MDM2 and CHIP (Li et al., 2011b). HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA show promise in destabilizing mutant p53 by
preventing HDAC6 from interacting with Hsp90 (Li et al., 2011a).
However, SAHA and the pan-HDAC inhibitor NaB were recently
shown to not only regulate mutant p53 stability, but also its transcription via the p53 activator HoxA5 (Yan et al., 2013). This
activity was not confined to mutant p53 and also extended to
decreasing wild-type p53 expression (Yan et al., 2013), indicating that care should be taken to determine the p53 status of
tumors when HDAC inhibitors are used as therapeutic agents.
Small molecule activators of SIRT1 have also been shown to
lead to the deacetylation of p53 and reduction of overall mutant
p53 levels (Yi et al., 2013). In other studies, Stathmin—a transcriptional target of wild-type p53 and mutant p53 (through the
regulation of miR-223)—promoted mutant p53 activity by regulating phosphorylation and stability in ovarian cancers (Sonego
et al., 2013).
Autophagy also plays a role in mutant p53 degradation.
Macro-autophagy is the process by which intracellular contents
such as proteins or organelles are engulfed and degraded
through lysosomes. This can provide a means to recycling intracellular content, providing an alternative energy source to allow
cells to survive transient starvation, and also functioning to remove damaged or excess organelles (Mizushima et al., 2008).
The role of autophagy in cancer is complex and can both promote and inhibit tumor development, depending on the targets
of the autophagic process and the timing during tumor evolution
(Liu and Ryan, 2012). Macro-autophagy induced by glucose re-

striction selectively promoted mutant p53 degradation, whereas
wild-type p53 was stabilized under similar conditions (Rodriguez
et al., 2012). The degradation of mutant p53 was promoted by
proteasomal inhibition and depended on functional autophagy
machinery (Choudhury et al., 2013; Rodriguez et al., 2012).
Glucose starvation combined with confluent growth conditions
could promote mutant p53 degradation by a specialized form
of autophagy known as chaperone-mediated autophagy (Vakifahmetoglu-Norberg et al., 2013). In contrast to the findings of
Rodriguez et al. (2012), degradation of mutant p53 via this
specialized autophagy pathway was enhanced by inhibition of
macro-autophagy (Vakifahmetoglu-Norberg et al., 2013), suggesting conditional aspects to glucose deprived mutant p53
degradation. Furthermore, both mutant and wild-type p53 can
inhibit autophagy when localized in the cytoplasm (Morselli
et al., 2008; Tasdemir et al., 2008), indicating that the relationship
between autophagy and mutant p53 is complex.
Therefore, while targeting mutant p53 for degradation seems
feasible, there remains a concern as to how effective simple
removal of mutant p53 (without replacement by degradationresistant wild-type p53) might be in driving a therapeutic
response. Some comfort has been provided by many studies
showing reduction of mutant p53 levels (either by siRNA or
spautin treatment) results in increased apoptosis, indicating
that these cells may have become dependent on mutant p53
for their survival (Table 1; Ali et al., 2013; Braicu et al., 2013;
Huang et al., 2013; Hui et al., 2006; Lim et al., 2009; Vakifahmetoglu-Norberg et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2011,
2013). However, whether decreasing mutant p53 levels is sufficient as a means of therapy in vivo and in the long term requires
confirmation.
Targeting Mutant p53 Regulated Pathways
Instead of targeting mutant p53 directly, another approach is to
identify commonalities in the mechanisms through which mutant
p53 proteins function and to target and exploit these downstream pathways (Figure 1). Despite the clear differences between mutant p53s, a large number of them interact and inhibit
p63 and p73. A small molecule named RETRA, identified by
serendipity in a screen to identify drugs to stabilize wild-type
p53, has been suggested to destabilize the p73 mutant p53 interaction (Kravchenko et al., 2008). RETRA-induced release of p73
resulted in the activation of p73 target genes and a concomitant
decreased tumor cell survival and suppression of xenograft
tumor growth (Kravchenko et al., 2008). Whether RETRA impairs
the interaction of mutant p53s with other target proteins has not
been reported, but this could be a more general approach to
block the oncogenic effect of mutant p53s that share binding
partners.
Downstream pathways activated by mutant p53 may also be
targets for therapeutic intervention. An attractive possibility
here is the cholesterol synthesis pathway through which mutant
p53 disrupts the morphology of mammary tumors (Freed-Pastor
et al., 2012). Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis restored the morphology and decreased survival of mutant p53 cells (FreedPastor et al., 2012). This is of particular interest because statins
(cholesterol inhibitors) are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide to prevent cardiovascular diseases
and have shown promise as preventive anticancer agents (Singh
Cancer Cell 25, March 17, 2014 ª2014 The Authors 311

Cancer Cell

Perspective
and Singh, 2013). It will therefore be interesting and relatively
straightforward to determine the utility of statins as a therapeutic
strategy for mutant p53 tumors.
Finally, several studies have described a role for mutant p53 in
enhancing receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling (Adorno
et al., 2009; Muller et al., 2009; Sauer et al., 2010; Wang et al.,
2013a). A multitude of inhibitors of the kinase activity of RTKs
or their downstream mediators have been described, including
EGFR inhibitors, MET inhibitors and MAPK inhibitors. Selective
efficacy of these compounds in the treatment of mutant p53 expressing cancers remains to be explored. The specific role of
RTK and integrin recycling may also provide an additional attractive target, since various integrin antibodies and drugs that
inhibit integrin recycling are currently on the market and have
shown some promise as anticancer agents (Desgrosellier and
Cheresh, 2010).
Future Directions
A number of hurdles still need to be overcome before the studies
of mutant p53 can be translated into clinical practice. While there
is clear evidence that mutant p53 promotes various oncogenic
responses, the relative importance of survival, motility, invasion,
and metabolic changes, or the critical pathways through which
these responses are mediated remain unclear. How different
mutations affect p53 function also remains underexplored, as
does the comparative importance of loss of wild-type, dominant-negative, and GOF phenotypes. The fact that most mutant
p53s are expressed at very high levels in cancer cells (leading to
the immunohistochemical detection of p53 being used as a
proxy for the presence of mutant p53) makes these proteins
tremendously attractive therapeutic targets, and the efficacy of
inhibiting the activity of these mutant p53s or even re-establishing some wild-type function, as described above, holds great
promise. Such approaches depend, however, on designing
efficient mechanisms through which to target mutant p53, an
understanding of the activities and function of the many different
mutants, and the capacity to identify which mutation a tumor
carries (the latter likely to be the most easily attainable goal).
Maybe a more effective approach will be to explore the possibility of synthetic lethality as a therapeutic strategy. Recently, a
computational approach using gene expression from the NCI60 panel, the GBM (glioblastoma multiforme) project and the
TCGA (the cancer genome) project revealed a number of genes
and pathways that may result in synthetic lethality when targeted
in mutant p53-expressing tumors (Wang and Simon, 2013). The
majority of these genes were involved in the cell cycle, perhaps
reflecting the loss of wild-type p53 function, and an interesting
candidate identified in several of the data sets is polo-like kinase
1 (PLK1), which is involved in the regulation of mitosis. PLK1 was
found to be upregulated in breast cancers with mutant p53
expression; the presence of both coincided with a worse prognosis than cancers with either PLK1 upregulation or mutant
p53 expression alone (King et al., 2012). Because PLK1 can be
inhibited by a variety of compounds (Strebhardt, 2010), it will
be interesting to follow up this lead.
Conclusions
Recent data reveal that mutant p53 is not just one protein, but a
multitude of proteins that can contribute to a wide range of onco312 Cancer Cell 25, March 17, 2014 ª2014 The Authors

genic processes. Designing drug strategies to target mutant p53
tumors is therefore highly challenging and will require a deeper
understanding of the degradation pathways, interaction partners, and downstream signaling pathways in mutant p53 cells.
However, we are optimistic that our ever-expanding knowledge
of mutant p53 function will translate into some useful therapeutic
strategies in the future.
