Abstract
We determined previously that a novel human telomerase RNA
(hTR) antagonist, GRN163L, inhibited the tumorigenic potential of A549-luciferase (A549-luc) lung cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo. Further studies revealed that A549-luc cells were also
morphologically altered by GRN163L. A549-luc cells treated
before cell attachment with a single dose of GRN163L only
weakly attached to the substrate and remained rounded,
whereas control mismatch-treated cells exhibited typical
epitheloid appearance and adhesion properties. These morphologic changes were independent of hTR expression and
telomerase inhibition and were unrelated to telomere length.
This effect is dependent on the molecular properties of the
lipid moiety, the phosphorothioate backbone, and the
presence of triplet-G sequences within the GRN163L structure.
Altered adhesion was manifested by a 50% reduction in rapid
cellular attachment and a 3-fold decrease in total cell spreading surface area. Administration of a single dose of GRN163L
(15 mg/kg) at the time of cell inoculation, using an in vivo
model of lung cancer metastasis, resulted in significant
reductions in tumor burden at days 13, 20, and 27 of tumor
progression. Thus, the potent antimetastatic effects of
GRN163L may be related, in part, to the antiadhesive effects
of this novel cancer therapeutic conferred via specific
structural determinants and that these effects are independent of telomerase inhibition or telomere shortening. [Cancer

Introduction
One challenge in the development of novel anticancer strategies
is the identification of new molecular targets. Greater than 90% of
all human cancer cells display robust activation of telomerase (1), a
unique reverse transcriptase consisting of two major components,
the template RNA [human telomerase RNA (hTR) or hTERC] and
the catalytic subunit (hTERT; refs. 2–4). In contrast, normal human
cells lack telomerase activity, with the exception of male germ-line
cells, proliferative cells of renewal tissues (5–7), and perhaps rare
cycling primary presenescent human fibroblasts (8). Telomerase
activation is necessary for the extensive proliferation and
subsequent metastasis of most cancer cells. In the last decade, a
variety of methods have been devised to pinpoint telomerase as an
exceptional target for cancer therapeutics (9–11). Although some

telomerase inhibitors are entering early-stage clinical trials, there
is still much about these inhibitors that are not completely understood.
A new class of oligonucleotide telomerase inhibitors that target
the hTR component of telomerase has been developed recently
(12). GRN163, a N3¶!P5¶ thio-phosphoramidate, causes reversible
telomerase inhibition and subsequent telomere shortening in
many cell types, including human mammary epithelial cells (13).
Importantly, GRN163 is not a typical antisense oligonucleotide
targeting mRNA. Because it is a direct enzymatic inhibitor at the
hTR active site, RNase H is not required and a 50% inhibition of
target can lead to telomere dysfunction (14). GRN163-induced
telomere erosion also causes the induction of senescence or apoptosis in prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma cells as well as a reduction of tumor growth in myeloma and
glioblastoma xenograft models (15–17). It has been reported that
telomerase has multiple functions besides maintenance of telomeres,
which may have some bearing on the observations that GRN163L
induces senescence or apoptosis in addition to telomere erosion (18).
As with most anionic oligonucleotides, repeated transfection of
GRN163 with cationic lipophilic carriers was required for efficient
intracellular uptake because naked oligonucleotides are relatively
poorly internalized (19–24). Thus, we synthesized a second generation
of GRN163 that contained a 5¶-terminal palmitoyl (C16) moiety
conjugated to the thio-phosphoramidate backbone of GRN163 and
designated it as GRN163L (19). The lipidation of GRN163 greatly
increased the intracellular uptake, inhibition of telomerase, rate of
telomere shortening, growth inhibition, and apoptosis in human
mammary epithelial and hepatoma cell lines (19–21).
Of particular interest was the observation that within only 1 to
2 weeks of treatment with GRN163L, A549 lung cancer and MDAMB-435 breast cancer cells exhibited reductions in clonal efficiency,
loss of anchorage-dependent growth capabilities, and decreased
invasiveness (21, 22). These changes in cell behavior were much too
rapid to be caused by progressive telomere shortening, which
previous researchers have found with the parental GRN163. Indeed,
our earlier results indicate that critical telomere shortening in cell
culture in the A549 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines required 6 to
8 weeks of continuous treatment with GRN163L (21, 22). However,
after 1 day of GRN163L treatment, A459 cells exhibited morphologic alterations, suggesting changes in cellular adhesion (22).
In this report, we characterize the antiadhesive effects of
GRN163L in vitro and in vivo. We show that the morphologic
changes induced by GRN163L are independent of hTR expression,
independent of telomerase holoenzyme inhibition, and unrelated
to the telomere length of cancer cells. The rapid morphologic
alterations are related to a dysfunction in cell adhesion induced by
GRN163L, manifested by a reduction in both the strength of cellular
attachment and the total cell spreading surface area. We also
report that in vivo i.p. administration of a single dose of GRN163L

(15 mg/kg) at the time of cell inoculation results in a reduction in
A549-luciferase (A549-luc) lung cancer metastasis. This suggests
that the antimetastatic effect of GRN163L on A549 cells may be
related, in part, to the anticell adhesive effects of this novel cancer
therapeutic. These findings represent an unanticipated mechanism
of action for GRN163L, which may open new avenues for
therapeutic treatments.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and morphologic analysis. Human non–small cell lung
adenocarcinoma cells (A549) were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and grown in XS medium (4:1 DMEM/
medium 199 + 10% CCS; HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37jC under 5% CO2.
A549 cells that express lentivirally delivered luciferase (A549-luc) were
generated as described previously (22). BJ (normal skin fibroblasts), SUSM-1
(4-nitroquinoline–immortalized liver fibroblasts), and VA13 (SV40-immortalized lung fibroblasts) were all obtained from ATCC.
For morphologic analyses, 0  105 to 3  105 cells in 10 mL medium were
seeded into 10-cm2 culture dishes and 1 Amol/L mismatch or 1 Amol/L
GRN163L was added directly to the dish before cell attachment. Phasecontrast micrographs were taken using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M at
20 magnification (Carl Zeiss-Thornwood, NY).
Synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides. All oligonucleotides, except the
shorter versions of GRN163L, were synthesized as described previously (15).
Truncated versions of GRN163L (11, 9, and 7 mer) were purchased from
Transgenomic, Inc. (Omaha, NE). The prepared oligonucleotides were
solubilized in normal saline and their concentrations were determined by
UV spectroscopy.
Telomerase activity assay. Telomerase activity from cell extracts was
analyzed using the PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol
(TRAP) assay (1). Samples were resolved by PAGE and scanned using a Storm
860 PhosphorImager scanner system (Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ). Quantitation and visualization of the TRAP gels were as
described (21, 22).
Generation of adenoviral hTERT-A549-luc cells. A549-luc cells (70%
confluent) were exposed to adenoviral hTERT (AdhTERT; multiplicity of
infection of 30) for 16 h in medium without serum. The virus was then
removed and complete medium was then added. Transfection frequency
was z75% after 24 h.
Immunofluorescence. A549-luc and A549-luc-AdhTERT cells (1  104/
300 AL medium) were seeded into eight-well chamber slides and allowed to
attach overnight. Then, the cells were fixed in 4% PAF, permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The
slides were incubated with antimouse hTERT antibody (1A4; 5 Ag/mL)
produced at Geron Corp. (Menlo Park, CA) and rhodamine-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc., West Grove,
PA), then mounted with Vectoshield + 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and viewed using a Zeiss
Axiovert 200M microscope. All original pictures were taken using a
magnification of 20.
hTR reverse transcription-PCR. Total cellular RNA was extracted from
cultured cells using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was
done using a one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) with hTR primers:
5¶-TCTAACCCTAACTGAGAAGGGCGTAG-3¶ (F3B-hTR) and 5¶-CCAGCAGCTGACATTTTTTG-3¶ (Htr189R; ref. 25). As internal controls for the
quantity and quality of the RNA specimens, RT-PCR amplifications targeting
transcripts of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were done in parallel.
Cell attachment and spreading assays. Cell attachment and spreading
were carried out following the methodology described in Current Protocols
in Cell Biology (Cell Substrate Adhesion Assays 9.1).6 Briefly, wells in a

96-well plate (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated overnight at 4jC
with Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS) or type I collagen (1–25 Ag/mL; BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA). Free collagen was aspirated and wells were blocked with
HI-BSA (10 mg/mL) overnight at 4jC. Wells were washed with DPBS. A549luc cells were trypsinized briefly and detached quickly. Cells (1  105/mL
for spreading and 1  106/mL for attachment) were resuspended gently in
CO2-conditioned medium [DMEM-HEPES-10% fetal bovine serum gassed
with 5% (v/v) CO2 for 20–30 min]. Care was taken to guard against cell
clumping and aggregation. Cells in conditioned medium were placed in
50 mL tubes in incubators (5% CO2 at 37jC) uncovered for 10 to 15 min to
allow for the recovery from trypsinization and the reexpression of cell
surface molecules that mediate cell attachment and spreading. Mismatch or
GRN163L was diluted with DPBS and the diluted oligonucleotides were
added to the 96-well plate, and then 5  103 cells for spreading and 5  104
cells for attachment were added to the wells.
For attachment assays, cells (in triplicate) were incubated with
oligonucleotides for 20 min at 37jC. Cells were washed, which removed
some weakly adherent cells, and fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde for 20 min
at room temperature. The fixed cells were stained with filtered 0.1%
crystal violet diluted in 200 mmol/L MES (pH 6) for 1 h at room
temperature. The dye was solubilized in 10% acetic acid for 15 min on an
orbital shaker. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microtiter plate
reader. Data are expressed as relative attachment, which is equivalent to
absorbance. For spreading assays, conditioned cells were incubated with
test oligonucleotides for 90 min at 37jC. Media were aspirated and cells
were fixed directly with 5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min room temperature.
Fixative was aspirated and cells were stored at 4jC in CMF-DPBS-NaN3.
Cells were viewed on an inverted phase-contrast microscope at 63, oil
using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M. Total cell surface area was quantified with
Axio-Vision (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Thornwood, NY).
Xenograft mice experiments and bioluminescence in vivo imaging
of A549-luc cells. Immunodeficient mice (nu/nu; Harlan Sprague Dawley,
Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were maintained in pathogen-free conditions within
the Animal Research Committee (ARC) at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center and treated according to ARC and Animal
Care and Use Committee guidelines. Mice were irradiated with 3.5 Gy 137Cs
18 to 24 h before tail vein injections with A549-luc cells. The cell viability was checked via trypan blue exclusion and 1  106 cells/200 AL NaCl
(0.9%) were injected into the tail vein of four mice per group. Immediately
after cell inoculation, mice were given a single dose of either mismatch
(15 mg/kg) or GRN163L i.p. Mice were imaged weekly using a novel light
emission tomography system as described previously (21, 22). All images
were taken for 10 min. Signal intensity was quantified as the sum of all
detected photon counts within the region of interest after subtraction of
background luminescence using Igor Pro software.

Results
Rapid morphologic alterations induced by GRN163L. A549luc cells were treated before cell attachment with a single dose of
either 1 Amol/L mismatch control oligonucleotide (mismatch) or
GRN163L (163L), and cell morphology and telomerase inhibition
were assessed after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation (Fig. 1A). After
24 h, the mismatch-treated cells exhibited a typical epitheloid
appearance with properly flattened cytoplasmic extensions and
evidence of proliferation, whereas the 163L-treated cells were
weakly attached, rounded up, and had thin elongated cytoplasmic
extrusions. This altered cellular morphology was persistent after
prolonged treatment (Fig. 1A). Telomerase activity was also
reduced >90% in A549-luc cells treated with a single dose of
1 Amol/L 163L (Fig. 1B and C). Even after 72 h, the growth rate
of the A549 cells was only reduced by 35%, suggesting that GRN
163L is not overtly toxic (data not shown).
GRN163L-induced altered cell morphology is independent
of hTR and telomerase holoenzyme inhibition. To determine if

GRN163L Alters Cell Adhesion

A, A549-luc cells (1  105) were treated with either 1 Amol/L mismatch (MM ) or 163L before cell attachment, and phase-contrast photomicrographs (20) were
taken after 24, 48, or 72 h of treatment. Similar results were obtained in at least five independent experiments. B, TRAP analysis of telomerase activity (TRAP activity)

positive controls [H1299 cells (2,500, 250, and 25 cells)]; lanes 5 to 8, 24 h of treatment of mismatch or 163L; lanes 9 to 12, 48 h of treatment of mismatch or 163L;

the altered cellular phenotype induced by 163L was mediated via
hTR, hTR-negative cells were examined. Both the SUSM-1–
immortalized liver fibroblasts and the VA13 lung fibrosarcoma
cells (Fig. 2A) were altered morphologically by 163L, whereas
normal BJ foreskin fibroblasts, which express low-to-moderate
levels of hTR (data not shown), were not affected by 163L. This
provides evidence that hTR per se is not involved in the altered
morphology induced by GRN163L. Figure 2B shows the RT-PCR
confirmation of the lack of hTR expression in SUSM-1 and VA13
cells. VA13 cells expressing an exogenous hTR (VA13hTR) were
used as a positive control.
Truncated versions of 163L that have less of a telomerase
inhibitory effect were synthesized in efforts to determine if
telomerase inhibition and/or oligonucleotide length was essential
for the alteration of A549 cell morphology (Table 1). A549-luc cells
were treated with a single dose of mismatch or 13-, 11-, 9-, and
7-mer GRN163L-derived oligonucleotides at the time of cell

attachment. All three of the shorter oligomers (11, 9,. and 7 mer)
caused the altered cell phenotype within 24 h (7-mer; Fig. 2C)
to the same extent as the full-length 13 mer. As expected, the
truncated oligomers (11, 9, and 7 mer) had decreasing abilities to
inhibit telomerase activity when compared with the full-length
13-mer 163L (Fig. 2D). The 7-mer minimally inhibited telomerase
activity (Fig. 2D) yet induced the same magnitude of antiadhesive
effects as 163L (Fig. 2C). These data suggested that GRN163L has
two independent mechanisms of action in the A549 cells: one wellcharacterized effect on telomerase inhibition, directly mediated by
its interaction with the hTR, and another novel anti–cell adhesive
mechanism, which is independent of hTR expression and
telomerase inhibition.
Short telomeres are unlikely to be related to changes in cell
shape stimulated by GRN163L. Inhibition of telomerase may lead
to the erosion of a few critically short telomeres causing telomere
end-end fusions and subsequent mitotic catastrophy, culminating

in widespread intracellular destruction. We tested the hypothesis
that the anti–cell adhesive effect of GRN163L may be due to
catastrophic telomere deletion events that occur as a result of
telomerase inhibition. Because A549 cells have heterogenous
telomeres (23), we transiently elongated telomeres via infection
with AdhTERT (Fig. 3). Because adenoviral vectors are not
integrated into the genome, AdhTERT only transiently elongates
the shortest parental telomeres, and after approximately 2 to 3
weeks, its expression is undetectable. Thus, we transiently
elongated telomeres, waited 2 to 3 weeks (14–22 population
doublings), and then determined if the treatment with GRN163L
induced alteration of the cell morphology. Figure 3A shows the
immunofluorescence localization of exogenously expressed AdhTERT using a monoclonal antibody (GRN 1A4) that recognizes
hTERT. Control A549-luc cells contain too little hTERT to be seen
with the GRN 1A4 monoclonal antibody. However, exogenously
expressed hTERT was detected in 40% of A549 cells + AdhTERT
after 6 days of infection. By 16 days of infection, only 10% of
AdhTERT cells could be detected, and by 33 days, no A549 cells
were immunopositive, indicating that the AdhTERT had become

diluted out during cell propagation. The transient infection with
AdhTERT coincided with a 60-fold increase in TRAP activity after
6 days of infection, and by 33 days, TRAP activity had returned to
basal levels (Fig. 3B and C). Figure 3D shows that control A549-luc
cells treated with a single dose of 1 Amol/L 163L at the time
of seeding exhibited an altered cell morphology after 24 h of
incubation (Figure 3D, top ). Similarly, A549-luc cells with
adenovirally elongated telomeres remained susceptible to the
rapid morphologic changes induced by GRN163L (Figure 3D,
middle and bottom). These experiments suggest that critically short
telomeres on some chromosomes are not involved in the
morphologic changes induced by GRN163L.
GRN163L-induced altered A549-luc cell adhesion is due to
a reduction in cell attachment and an inhibition of cell
spreading. To determine if the rapid morphologic alterations were
related to a dysfunction in cell adhesion, A549-luc cells were treated
before cell attachment (Fig. 4A, top) or after overnight attachment
(Fig. 4A, bottom) with a single dose of either 1 Amol/L mismatch
control or GRN163L (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, 163L only alters cell
adhesion when the cells were treated before cell attachment. These

negative) and normal BJ cells were treated before cell attachment with either 1 Amol/L mismatch or 163L, and phase-contrast photomicrographs (20) were
taken after 24 hof treatment. Similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments. B, RT-PCR analysis of hTR levels in SUSM-1, VA13, and

(20) were taken after 24 h of treatment. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. D, 24 h of TRAP analysis of A549-luc cells treated before

GRN163L Alters Cell Adhesion

findings suggested that an aspect of cell adhesion was involved in
this antiadhesive phenomenon induced by GRN163L.
Using a colorimetric assay to determine cell attachment efficiency, Fig. 4B (left) shows that A549-luc cells treated before cell
attachment with a single dose of 1 Amol/L GRN163L (163L)
exhibit a 50% reduction in the ability to attach firmly to plastic
substrata after 20 min when compared with cells treated with
1 Amol/L mismatch control. Interestingly, cells that were treated
preattachment, but were seeded into wells coated with type I
collagen (1–25 Ag/mL), did not exhibit any differences in
attachment strength efficiency when compared with mismatch
control–treated cells. Thus, type I collagen blocks the GRN163Linduced rounding that reduced the strength of attachment.
Importantly, A549-luc cells, allowed to attach to the plastic
substrata for 1 h, were resistant to the antiadhesive effect of 163L
(Fig. 4B, right).
The alteration in cell adhesion in the 163L-treated cells,
attributed above to an inhibition of cell spreading, is documented
in Fig. 4C. A549-luc cells treated before cell attachment (preattachment panels) with a single dose of 1 Amol/L GRN163L have
incomplete cytoplasmic protrusions coupled with retarded cell
flattening after 90 min of incubation, whereas cells treated with
1 Amol/L mismatch control appear well spread with numerous
lamellipodia. Cells that were treated preattachment, but were
seeded into wells coated with type I collagen (25 Ag/mL), did not
exhibit any differences in the ability to spread and flatten out when
compared with mismatch control–treated cells. Quantitatively
(Fig. 4D), the 57% reduction in total cell surface area of 163L
compared with mismatch-treated cells was abolished in collagencoated wells (Fig. 4B and D). Thus, type I collagen blocks the
GRN163L-induced reduction of cell spreading. Importantly, A549luc cells that were allowed to attach to the plastic substrata for
1 h were less resistant to 163L because there was only a
22% reduction in cell spreading between the mismatch- and
163L-treated cells (Fig. 4C and D, right).

Determination of the key molecular components of GRN163L
which confer the antiadhesive effect. To dissect the important
antiadhesive features of GRN163L, we designed and tested several
other oligonucleotides that were similar in structure but contain
specific modifications in the lipid moiety, backbone chemistry, or
G-rich motif. Data shown in Table 1 were collected using 1 Amol/L
of the oligonucleotides added before plating the cells in
plates. Altered adhesion strength (rounding) was determined after
24 h and TRAP inhibition was measured 72 h after oligonucleotide
addition.
We predicted that the most important structural component
involved in the antiadhesive effect of 163L was the lipidation of the
compound because lipidation plays a key role for bioavailability.
We observed that the unlipidated parental GRN163 does not alter
cell adhesion (Table 1). These data indicate that the potential
molecular target may be intracellular. In addition, if the palmitoyl
group is substituted for lipids with different structures, such as
‘‘teflon’’ or cholesterol, cell adhesion is reduced because there were
inactive at 1 Amol/L but showed effects at 10 Amol/L (data not
shown).
We also hypothesized that the nitrogen-phosphorous-sulfur–
containing backbone chemistry (NPS linkage) might be important
in the anti–cell adhesion induced by 163L. Our data show that
oligonucleotides that have alternative backbone chemistries
(oligonucleotides 1 and 2; i.e, phosphoramidate oligonucleotides)
did not alter cell adhesion, suggesting that the thio-containing
backbone chemistry in 163L is an important factor in impeding cell
adhesion.
Because the mismatch control differs from 163L only by the lack
of three contiguous guanine residues, it seemed that this motif
might also be necessary for the altered cell adhesion phenotype.
The data collected using the truncated versions of 163L (11, 9, and
7 mer), which retain the triple-G motif, are consistent with this
concept. All of these shortened derivatives of 163L alter cell
adhesion to the same extent as the full-length 163L-13mer. This

were obtained in a separate independent experiment.

hypothesis is further supported by the fact that oligonucleotides
3 and 4, which lack the triple-G motif, do not alter A549 cell
adhesion.
Thus, it seems that the combination of lipophilicity conferred
by the palmitic group, the thio-containing backbone chemistry,
and the triple-G motif all contribute to making GRN163L an
antiadhesive agent. This is best exemplified by oligonucleotides
5 and 6, which contain the three aforementioned molecular
determinants and subsequently alter adhesion with no effect on
telomerase inhibition; further distinguishing the antiadhesive
mechanisms from the telomerase inhibitory effects.
A single dose of GRN163L given in vivo reduces A549-luc
cell metastasis to the lung. A human xenograft model of lung
cancer metastasis was used to determine the effect of a single i.p.
dose of GRN163L (15 mg/kg) given at the time of i.v. A549-luc lung
cancer cell inoculation in athymic nude mice. We found that a
single dose of GRN163L (15 mg/kg) resulted in a 92%, 76%, and 53%

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

reduction in tumor load at days 13, 20, and 27, as determined by
bioluminescent imaging (of luciferase-expressing A549 cells) of
GRN163L versus mismatch-treated (15 mg/kg) controls (Fig. 5).
Because reductions in A549-luc cell attachment and spreading
were found in vitro (Fig. 4), one interpretation of these finding is
that the antiadhesive effects of GRN163L may be related, at least in
part, to the reductions in lung tumor burden found in vivo in this
experimental model of metastasis.

Discussion
Targeted cancer therapeutics are being developed to be more
effective and to alleviate the toxic side effects typically elicited by
conventional chemotherapeutics. We have developed a new
generation of oligonucleotide analogues, lipid-conjugated N3¶!P5¶
thio-phosphoramidate GRN163L, which is a promising anticancer
compound (19–24, 26). We have shown previously that this hTR

antagonist efficiently inhibits telomerase, which culminates in a
reduction of several transformed and metastatic phenotypes
in vitro and in vivo (19, 21, 22). The ability of GRN163L to act as
an anticancer agent, before this report, was believed to be
mediated by inhibiting telomerase via direct interaction with the
hTR. The results from our present study show a previously uncharacterized antiadhesive effect of GRN163L, which may represent a
novel antimetastatic mechanism of action for this compound. Most
importantly, we hypothesize that the reduction in A549 lung
metastases in GRN163L-treated mice is at least a partial in vivo
manifestation of the decreased adhesiveness of the A549 cells that
we observe in vitro.
Furthermore, these rapid morphologic changes induced by
GRN163L were independent of its known telomerase inhibitory
effect via hTR antagonism. We used two different ALT (telomerase
independent) cell lines (SUSM-1 and VA13) that completely lack
hTR RNA expression to show that even in the total absence of hTR
expression, GRN163L still alters cell morphology (Fig. 2A). This

observation also suggests that the anti–cell adhesive effects of
GRN163L may be effective against ALT tumors.
We rationalized that the phenotypic changes in morphology
induced by GRN163L were a result of altered cell adhesion. Cell
adhesion can be viewed as an intricately orchestrated two-step
process (i.e., initial attachment to the substratum and subsequent
cell spreading). We found that the changes in cell morphology were
prevalent only if the A549-luc cells were treated within the first few
hours of cell attachment. If cells were allowed to firmly attach to
plastic substrata overnight, they were resistant to the reduced cell
attachment and spreading induced by GRN163L (Fig. 4).
Several reports suggest that oligonucleotides with other chemistries (e.g., phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, 2-O-Me PS RNA)
can also act in a sequence-specific manner to alter cell adhesion
due to their protein interactive capabilities (27–30). Phosphorothioates have a sulfur-for-oxygen atom substitution at the
backbone phosphorous, which is similar in structure to the novel
N3¶!P5¶ thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide analogue GRN163L

obtained in at least five independent experiments. B, attachment assay quantitation of A549-luc cells plated on plastic (0 Ag/mL) or type I collagen (1, 6, or 25 Ag/mL).

were obtained in at least three independent experiments. C, spreading assay photomicrographs of A549-luc cells plated on plastic or type I collagen (25 Ag/mL).

luciferase-expressing A549 cells were recorded at days 13, 20, and 27 of tumor progression. B, average BLI signals. Similar results were obtained in

used in this study. GRN163L is a ‘‘hybrid’’ between phosphorothioates and phosphoramidate oligonucleotides because it contains a bridging nitrogen atom included in the backbone, which
greatly enhances its hydrolytic stability in vitro. Indeed, when
oligonucleotide N3¶!P5¶ thio-phosphoramidates were first developed, the chemistry was designed to combine the attractive
pharmacokinetic properties of the phosphorothioate protein
interactive capabilities with the high RNA binding affinity of the
phosphoramidates (12).
The ability of phosphorothioates to bind proteins is not
completely understood; however, others have proposed two
mechanisms to address the ability of various DNA oligonucleotides
to bind to proteins. The first idea is that these highly sulfonated
polyanionic molecules can bind in a sequence and length
dependent or independent manner with numerous proteins that
play key roles in cell adhesion, such as fibronectin, basic fibroblast
growth factor, soluble CD4, HIV gp120, laminin, and several protein
kinase C isoforms (29, 30). These DNA oligonucleotide-protein
interactions are believed to occur via simple ionic and, possibly,
covalent chemical bonding resulting from the attraction of the
highly electronegative phosphorothioates to basic residues within
the proteins in question (24). Our current data neither support nor
negate this concept because we observed that oligonucleotides that
lack the sulfur moiety in the backbone failed to alter cell adhesion,
but the presence of the thio-containing backbone alone is not
sufficient to alter cell adhesion (Table 1). It is noteworthy to

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

mention that the unlipidated GRN163 did not alter adhesion in the
same context as GRN163L, suggesting that lipidation and
subsequent intracellular localization is important.
The second mechanism through which DNA oligonucleotides
bind to proteins may be related to the contiguous deoxyguanosine
residues within the sequence because it has been reported that
antisense oligonucleotides that have four or more sequential
deoxyguanosines can exert an unusual avidity for proteins (27–30).
It has also been proposed that G-rich oligonucleotides can form
quadruple helices that interact with proteins; however, the
mechanisms have not been extensively studied (26). Although it
has been shown that G-rich constructs make better anti-cell
adhesives, the G-quartet motif seemed necessary but not sufficient
to produce an antiadhesive effect: a sequence of three or more
deoxyguanosine residues is required to alter cell adhesion (Table 1),
but only if palmitic or oleic groups are present.
Interestingly, GRN163L-treated cells seeded into wells coated
with type I collagen (1–25 Ag/mL) did not exhibit any differences in
morphologic appearance, attachment efficiency, or cellular spreading when compared with mismatch-treated cells (Fig. 4). Similar
results have also been reported for other compounds, such as
fibronectin- and laminin-coated dishes. It was reported that a
phosphorothioate antisense and sense oligonucleotide directed
toward RelA inhibit the adhesion and spreading of K-Balb, MCF-7,
and DU-145 cells (30). However, when these cells are seeded onto
plates coated with fibronectin or laminin, the antiadhesive effects

of the RelA oligonucleotides were abolished. These researchers also
found that type IV collagen or vitronectin had no effect on the
antiadhesive effect of the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide.
According to the present study findings, type I collagen may
interact with GRN163L or provide an alternative spreading surface
that substitutes for these blocked by GRN163L, at least ex vivo
(Fig. 4B–D).
We also show that a single i.p. dose of GRN163L (15 mg/kg) can
result in a reduction in the colonization of A549-luc cells into the
lung (Fig. 5). This addresses the in vivo relevance of the present
findings. We hypothesize that the ability of GRN163L to decrease
cell attachment and spreading in vitro is recapitulated in vivo via a
reduction in tumor cell seeding and also by a diminished tumor
burden in experimental nude mouse models. Because GRN163L
recently entered phase I/II clinical trials, it may be beneficial to
take advantage of its antiadhesive action by administering the drug
at the time of tumor biopsy or tumor-reductive surgery. It has been
suggested that fine-needle aspiration may stimulate tumor
dissemination through the needle track via the mechanical

exfoliation of cancer cells (31). Thus, a single dose of GRN163L
may have a therapeutic effect on any disseminated tumor cells to
prevent the reattachment and recolonization and may possibly
prevent malignant spread. Pleural carcinosis has been also been
reported after the excision of malignant lung tumors (32, 33).
Therefore, for minimal residual disease, postcytoreductive surgery,
GRN163L may also be efficacious in reducing metastatic seeding
from tumor cells.
