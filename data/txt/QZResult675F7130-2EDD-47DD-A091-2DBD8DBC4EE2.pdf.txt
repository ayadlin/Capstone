ABSTRACT
Epidemiologic studies indicated that diabetics treated with metformin had a
lower incidence of cancer than those taking other anti-diabetes drugs. This led to a
surge in the efforts for identification of safer and more effective metformin mimetic
compounds. The plant Ficus microcarpa is widely used for the treatment of type
2 diabetes in traditional medicine in South Asia. We obtained extracts from this
plant and identified a small molecule, plectranthoic acid (PA), with potent 5′AMPactivated kinase (AMPK) activating properties far superior than metformin. AMPK
is the central hub of metabolic regulation and a well-studied therapeutic target
for metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes and cancer. We observed that treatment
of prostate cancer (PCa) cells with PA inhibited proliferation and induced G0/G1
phase cell cycle arrest that was associated with up-regulation of cyclin kinase
inhibitors p21/CIP1 and p27/KIP1. PA treatment suppressed mTOR/S6K signaling
and induced apoptosis in PCa cells in an AMPK-dependent manner. Interestingly,
PA-induced autophagy in PCa cells was found to be independent of AMPK activation.
Combination studies of PA and metformin demonstrated that metformin had an
inhibitory effect on PA-induced AMPK activation and suppressed PA-mediated
apoptosis. Given the anti-proliferative role of PA in cancer and its potent antihyperglycemic activity, we suggest that PA should be explored further as a novel
activator of AMPK for its ultimate use for the prevention of cancers and treatment
of type 2 diabetes.

studied in the context of type-2 diabetes and metabolic
syndrome. More recently, studies have shown that AMPK
is a possible metabolic tumor suppressor and target for
cancer prevention and possibly cancer treatment [3].
Reports are available for the role of AMPK in melanoma,
leukemia, ovarian, prostate and breast cancers [4–8].
AMPK inhibits/regulates mTOR which is consistently
deregulated in cancer cells, by activating TSC1/TSC2,
which results in dephosphorylation of the translation
inhibitor 4E-BP1 and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase
(S6K), consequently leading to termination of protein
translation. Thus, AMPK plays a central role in the control
of cell growth, proliferation and autophagy. Furthermore,
AMPK directly phosphorylates p53 on S15 residue, which

heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase, consisting of a
catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits (β and γ).
AMPK can be activated by extracellular changes, such as,
depletion of ATP, low glucose, and changes in NADPH
levels [1]. Activation of AMPK stimulates catabolic
pathways leading to ATP production such as fatty-acid
oxidation and blocks anabolic processes that consume ATP
such as lipid and cholesterol synthesis, increases glucose
uptake and stimulates autophagy [2]. The role of AMPK in
regulating metabolism is well understood; predominately

is essential for G1 -phase cell cycle arrest [9]. Accordingly,
in recent years it is increasingly appreciated that AMPK
activators may be a suitable therapeutic target against
human cancers.
Studies have shown that activated AMPK is
expressed frequently in primary human prostate cancer
specimens of various Gleason grades, suggesting its
involvement in the growth and survival of human
prostate cancer cells. Park et al. have further reported
that the growth of human prostate cancer cells is AMPKdependent and its inhibition suppresses cell proliferation,
suggesting its potential as a novel target for prevention and
treatment of human prostate cancer [10]. In contrast, Kim
et al, exploring the mechanistic basis of Remotiflori radix
ethanol extract (ERR)-induced death in prostate cancer
cells demonstrated that knockdown of AMPK dramatically
blocked ERR-mediated apoptosis [11]. However, more
recent studies have identified the energy sensor AMPK
as a viable therapeutic target in prostate cancer. Zadra
et al. showed that the AMPK activator MT 63-78 was a
potent inhibitor of prostate cancer cell growth in androgen
sensitive and castration resistant models, resulting in
mitotic arrest and apoptosis [12].
Many compounds activate AMPK such as 5,
amino-imidazol-4-carboxamide-1-b-4-ribofuranoside
(AICAR), metformin, phenformin, buformin and some
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
[13, 14]. Natural flavonoids (quercetin), polyphenols
(resveratrol), anthocyanin and berberine have also been
shown to activate AMPK [15, 16]. Although several
AMPK stimulators have been identified, each has its
own limitations. AICAR has a short half-life and poor
bioavailability, phenformin and buformin induce lactic
acidosis, and metformin may increase the risk of death in
non-obese individuals. These activators are also known to
have additional molecular targets and AMPK-independent
toxic effects which reduce their efficacy in cancer
[17–19]. In summary, there is a need to develop novel
therapeutic compounds that target this multifunctional
protein kinase at low concentrations [20, 21]. In addition,
most AMPK stimulators at low concentration are effect
at very high concentrations, posing the possibility of
undesired effects.
We isolated a novel triterpenoid plectranthoic acid
(PA) from Ficus microcarpa, a traditional plant with
antidiabetic properties. Our studies exploring its antihyperglycemic effects showed that PA inhibited amylase,
glucosidase and DPP4 activities suggestive of its possible
role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (unpublished data).
The purpose of the current study was to study the effects
of PA, using prostate cancer cells and investigate whether
AMPK serves as its molecular target in mediating the
observed anti-proliferative effects. We observed that PA
is a potent activator of AMPK with therapeutic potential
against prostate cancer.

Crude extract of Ficus microcarpa, its fractions
and isolated compounds inhibit proliferation
of cancer cells
Through liquid-liquid fractionation three fractions,
n-hexane (FMN), ethyl acetate (FME) and aqueous (FMA)
were prepared from crude extract of Ficus microcarpa
(FMC). FME showed toxicity to Agrobacterium
tumefaciens virulent strains At10 in potato disc tumor
assay (Sup. Figure 1). Two pure compounds were isolated
from FME via column chromatography which were then
characterized through NMR and identified as PA and 3, 4,
5 flavantetrol (FL) (Sup. Figure 2). The structure of both
compounds is shown in Figure 1A.
The crude extract and fractions were evaluated for
their efficacy in inhibiting the viability of cancer cells.
Employing the 3-(4, 5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, we initially evaluated
the anti-proliferative activity of the crude extract and its
fractions in melanoma (A375) and prostate (DU145, PC3,
CWRV1 and NB26) cancer cells. Results showed that
FMC, FMN, FME and FMA treatment (10-100μg/ml:24
h) inhibited the growth of cancer cells in a dose dependent
manner. However, FME was found to be more potent than
other fractions in the various cell lines examined (Sup.
Figure 3A). Next, we evaluated the anti-proliferative
activity of the isolated compounds (PA and Fl) at 24h.
PA significantly inhibited the viability of DU145, PC3,
CWRV1, NB26 and A375 cells with IC50 values ranging
from 25.4, 32.2, 41, 53.1 to 77μM, respectively (Figure
1B). As time course analysis revealed only a modest
difference between IC50 values of PA at 24h and 48h (Sup.
Figure 3B) further studies were performed at the 24h time
point. Antiproliferative effect of PA was further assessed
by BrDU assay on DU145, PC3 and NB26 prostate
cancer cells and results confirmed its anti-proliferative
activity (IC50: 35, 42, 61μM respectively) (Sup. Figure 4).
Clonogenic assays validated these findings, where selected
concentrations 20μM and 40μM showed a significant
dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation relative
to untreated controls (Figure 1C). Finally to ascertain if
PA was toxic to normal cells we performed MTT assay
on prostate epithelial (RWPE) cells and human epithelial
keratinocytes (NHEK). The IC50 values of 70.09μM and
98.91μM for RWPE and NHEKs indicated that PA had
no effect on the growth of normal cells at doses which
inhibited proliferation of cancer cells (Figure 1D).

We next evaluated the cell cycle profile of
prostate cancer cells treated with PA. Cells (DU145,

PC3 and NB26) were treated with PA (20μM&40μM:24
h) and cell cycle analysis was performed using flow
cytometry. Results showed that 24h treatment with PA
induced significant enrichment in the G0/G1 phase with
remarkable decrease in the fraction of cells in S phase
(Figure 2A). Our data showed that 66.46 % (20μM PA)
and 72.4% (40μM PA) cells were arrested in G0/G1
phase in DU145, 57.68% (20μM) and 72.69% (40μM)
in PC3 and 60 % (20&40μM) in NB26 as compared
to untreated controls (55.03%, 55.01% and 51.90%,
respectively). There was a corresponding decrease in
number of cells in S phase (0.88%: 12.16% vs 24.22%
for control in DU145, 17.88%: 3.55% vs 29.8% control
in PC3, 12.25%: 10.7% vs 24.16% for control in NB26).
Western blot analysis was performed to determine the
effect of PA treatment on cell cycle related proteins. A
dose dependent decrease in cyclins (Cyclin B1, D1, D2
and E2) and Cdks (Cdk 2, Cdk4 and Cdk6), accompanied
with induction of p21 and p27 was observed in PA treated
cells (Figure 2B, 2C, 2D).

After establishing through a series of experiments
that PA is a potent antiproliferative compound, we
next examined whether its growth inhibitory effect is
associated with induction of apoptosis. For this purpose
FITC staining of PA treated prostate cancer cells (DU145,
PC3 and NB26) was performed out and analyzed by
flow cytometry. There was a significant dose-dependent
increase in apoptotic cell population in PA treated cells.
As shown in Figure 3A, DU145 were more susceptible to
PA with higher percentage of TdT positive cells (39.8%
and 53.9%) as compared to PC3 (4.76% and 40.8%)
and NB26 (0.33% and 8.55%)). Western blot analysis
showed decreased expression levels of anti-apoptotic
proteins such as Bcl2 and Bcl-xl in a dose dependent
manner accompanied by an increase in the expression of
pro-apoptotic protein Bax (Figure 3B). Induction of late
apoptotic events was reflected by activation of terminal
caspase-3 and detection of cleaved PARP (Figure 3C).

effect of PA and metformin on AMPK activity in DU145
and PC3 cell lines. Our data showed that PA activated
AMPK at 20μM while metformin mediated activation
of AMPK occurred at 10mM. Interestingly, treatment of
cells with a combination of PA and metformin resulted in
a decrease in AMPK activity (Figure 4C).

In vitro cell-free enzymatic assays indicated that PA
possessed potent anti-hyperglycemic activity (unpublished
data). Since AMPK has been identified as a target for
anti-diabetic drugs, we asked whether PA modulates the
activity of the kinase. For this purpose DU145 and PC3
cells were treated with PA (20μM) and incubated for
different time periods (1, 3, 6 and 24h). AMPK activity
assay revealed a robust increase in AMPK activity after
PA treatment, in both cell lines (Figure 4A). Western
blot analysis of whole cell lysates showed an increase in
phosphorylation of AMPK α subunit at the Thr172 residue
(Figure 4B). This was associated with phosphorylation
of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC), in a time-dependent
manner. Dose-dependent studies further confirmed the
potential of PA as a potent AMPK activator (Sup. Figure
5). We next performed comparative studies to explore the

PA binds to γ subunit of AMPK with high affinity
We next determined the interaction of PA and AMPK
by in silico docking. Blind docking was performed with
Autodock4 (AD4 Scripps Institute) by preparing a docking
volume that included a large amount of the protein surface.
This allowed the docking program to examine many of
the various surface features. Blind docking volumes were
created for each of the three major domains in AMPK
(Figure 5A). Each Autodock run produced 30 orientations
of the docked molecules ranked on binding energy. The

more negative energies represent the summation of
physical terms that present the free energy of binding.
The lower this energy, the more favorable is the docking
orientation. Some of the orientations will have similar
poses with similar energies and are considered to be a
cluster of hits. Among α, β, and γ subunits, PA bound to γ
subunit with high affinity (Figure 5Aa). The lowest, most
preferred free energy of binding conformations within the
top cluster at γ, α and β were -9.91Kcal/mol, -8.31Kcal/
mol and -6.66Kcal/mol, respectively.
The γ site contains three AMP binding sites that
AD4 selected as potential PA binding sites (Figure 5Ab).
The most favorable site is an AMP binding surface pocket
containing lysine (Lys126) and arginine (Arg223) residues
(site A). In the most favorable orientation in site A, the
carboxylate of PA hydrogen bonds to these residues and
spans the pocket to bind the hydroxyl of PA to the backbone
of the protein in the bottom of the pocket (Figure 5Ac; Sup.
Figure 6A). In an alternate cluster of nearly equal minimum
energy (site B), the carboxylate and hydroxyl of PA flip
positions, and the carboxylate is buried in the pocket. There
are 10 orientations is the top cluster of site A, with a mean
binding energy of -9.07 Kcal/mol. The inverse orientation
cluster, site B, contains 6 poses with a mean binding energy
of -8.11 Kcal/mol. Since AD4 is accurate to + 2 Kcal/mol,
these two orientations are of equal probability.

Figure 5Ad shows the preferred binding mode in the
α domain, the ATP binding domain. The carboxylate of the
acid end of PA is hydrogen bonded to the backbone near
the n-terminal domain while the hydroxyl on the opposite
end of PA is buried in the kinase pocket (Sup. Figure 6B).
This docking does not include the hydrogen bonding
to the adenine binding loop found in common kinase
inhibitors, and docks poorly compared to staurosporine
(binding energy -9.2 Kcal/mol) (Figure 5Ae). The highly
hydrophobic core of PA is interfaced with hydrophobic
residues deep in the pocket. The top binding cluster
contains 8 poses with a mean binding energy of -8.21
Kcal/mol (Figure 5B).
The β site was found to be an activator site involving
the interface of α and β (Structural basis for AMP binding
to mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase. In this
structure, the carbohydrate binding domain, or the β
domain, and theα domain are linked by a small molecule
activator. This site contains the phosphorylated serine that
is important in AMPK activation. Docking in this site with
AD4 results in the weakest binding (Figure 5Aa). The
carboxylate of PA is hydrogen bonding to the phosphate of
the serine (Ser108) in the β domain while hydroxyl accepts
a proton from the backbone of Asn48 in the α domain.
The top orientation contains 11 in the cluster with a mean
binding energy of -6.62 Kcal/mol.

persisted till 24h in PC3 cells. Remarkably, there was
no induction of LC3B at any time point in DU145 cells
(Figure 6B).

We next turned our attention to pathways
downstream of AMPK, known to play a vital role in the
control of cell growth/proliferation and survival. Prostate
cancer cells were treated with PA (20 μM) and the effect
on mTOR signaling pathway and induction of autophagy
was evaluated. Western blot analysis of PA treated PC,
DU145 and NB26 cells showed remarkable decrease
in phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 and S6 Ser236/237
residues (Figure 6A). Next, distribution of the autophagy
marker LC3 was assessed in these cells. PA treatment
caused the induction of autophagy marker (LC3AB) in
PC3 and NB26 but not in DU145 cells (Figure 6A). A
time course analysis of S6K expression was conducted, as
readout for mTOR signaling. PA treated cells showed an
initial reduction in phosphorylation of S6 at 1h followed
by an increase at 3h, after which there was a significant
reduction in phosphorylation at all time points studied.
Moreover, induction of autophagy correlated to conversion
of LC3-I to LC3-II (LC3B) was observed at 6h which

Inhibition of mTOR signaling and induction
of apoptosis by PA is dependent on AMPK
activation
Based on the results above, we hypothesized that
inhibition of mTOR and induction of autophagy and
apoptosis by PA is dependent on AMPK activation. To test
this hypothesis, we treated PC3 and DU145 cells with PA
alone and in combination with compound C, an AMPK
inhibitor. Our data showed that significant inhibition of
phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 was observed in cells
treated with PA alone. However, treatment with compound
C reversed the reduction in phosphorylation in PA treated
cells (Figure 7A).
Next we analyzed the role of AMPK in PA mediated
autophagy. We observed no effect of compound C on the
induction of LC3B in PA treated cells suggesting that
induction of autophagy by PA is independent of AMPK

(Figure 7B). We further assessed the role of AMPK in
PA mediated apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed
abrogation of PA induced cleavage of caspase 3 in
compound C treated cells (Figure 7B). Flow cytometry
was performed to quantify the number of cells undergoing
apoptosis in PA treated cells exposed to compound C.
Results showed that treatment with PA alone (20μM)
resulted in 23.0% and 6.67% apoptosis in DU145 and PC3
cells, respectively but AMPK inhibition by compound C
blocked PA induced apoptosis in both cell lines (0.41%
and 0.3%) (Figure 7C; Sup. Figure 7A).
Combination studies of PA and metformin were
performed to evaluate the effect on mTOR pathway
and induction of autophagy and apoptosis. Western blot

studies showed that treatment of PC3 and DU145 cells
with either PA (20μM) or metformin (10mM) inhibited the
phosphorylation of S6 but this inhibition was not observed
in the combination treatment (Figure 7A). metformin
reduced the induction of PA mediated cell death in PC3
cells, as assessed by a decrease in cleaved caspase 3
and LC3B expression in the combination group (Figure
7B&7C; Sup. Figure 7A).

Our previous studies identified Ficus microcarpa,
native to Pakistan, India, Taiwan and Australia as a rich
source of bioactive compounds with potent antimicrobial
and antioxidant properties [22]. Studies in albino wistar
rats showed that the plant Ficus microcarpa possessed
anti-diabetic activity [23]. Triterpenes isolated from the
roots of Ficus microcarpa showed cytotoxicity to human
nasopharyngeal and colorectal carcinoma cells [24]. In
this study, we evaluated the activity of crude extract and
fractions of Ficus microcapra on cancer cells and showed
that the ethyl acetate fraction (FME) and the crude extract

exerted potent anti-proliferative effect on melanoma and
prostate cancer cells. We isolated two compounds, PA, a
pentacyclic triterpenoid and FL, a flavonoid from the FME
fraction (Figure 1). Cell viability studies demonstrated that
PA, when compared to FL was more effective in inhibiting
proliferation and viability of cancer cells. Cell cycle
analysis of PA treated prostate cancer cells showed arrest
in G0/G1 phase with accumulation of cell cycle inhibitors
p21 and p27, associated with a decrease in Cdks and
cyclins (Figure 2). This was accompanied with apoptosis
in PA treated cells, as assessed by cleavage of PARP
and Caspase-3 (Figure 3). Time course studies indicated
PA treatment resulted in autophagy concomitant with
induction of apoptosis (Figure 6B). Strikingly, relative to
cancer cells, normal human epithelial cells were resistant
to PA-mediated growth repression suggesting its potential
use as a growth inhibitory agent against prostate cancer
(Figure 1D).

One of the central regulators of cellular and
organismal metabolism in eukaryotes is AMPK, with
critical roles in growth, survival and cell polarity [8].
AMPK is a functional protein which is activated by
number of stresses including glucose deprivation,
ischemia, hypoxia and oxidative stress [25–27]. A
recent interest in the role of AMPK in common chronic
diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, has intensified
studies of its regulation in cellular and animal models.
Identification of new agents that can specifically target
AMPK-dependent pathways has recently emerged as a
field of intense and competitive studies. Our preliminary
studies on PA indicated that PA possessed significant antihyperglycemic activity (unpublished data). Since several
anti-hyperglycemic compounds are known modulators
of AMPK activity, we examined AMPK as a molecular
target for the observed PA-induced effects. Here, we
provide evidence that PA is a novel potent activator of

AMPK. Activation of AMPK requires phosphorylation
of the kinase at the Thr172 residue by upstream regulators
such as LKB1 and CaMKKβ [28]. Our studies in prostate
cancer cells showed that PA stimulated AMPK activity
independent of LKB1, and increased activity was observed
both in LKB1 null DU145 and LKB1 positive PC3 cells,
post PA treatment (Figure 4). A similar increase in AMPK
activity was noted in PA treated hepatocytes (unpublished
data) validating its role as an AMK activating agent.
In silico modeling, employed to determine potential
interactions between PA and AMPK indicated regulatory
γ subunit of AMPK as the preferred binding site for PA.
The two polar ends of PA bind to γ subunit in a shape
complementary manner (Figure 5). Labeling studies,
using the reactive AMP analogue 8-azido-[(32)P]AMP
have indicated that the γ subunit may participate directly
in the binding of AMP within the complex [29]. Binding
sites of PA was compared to the AMP binding sites and

and DU145 were analyzed for expression of autophagy marker (LC3AB) and apoptosis marker (caspase 3) after treating with PA alone or in
combination with compound C and metformin. C. Cells were labeled with FITC and analyzed by flow cytometry. Percentage of apoptotic
cells with the corresponding dose of PA or CC is shown on the histograms. The experiment was performed in triplicates and repeated thrice.

it was found that PA does not compete with AMP for
binding (Figure 5Ac). Metformin is also reported to bind
to γ subunit of AMPK, however unlike AMP or ZMP,
metformin is not a direct allosteric AMPK activator [30].
Our data suggest that binding of PA to γ subunit of AMPK
results in allosteric activation of the kinase, however
further studies are warranted to determine the mechanism
through which PA interacts with AMPK and induces the
phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.
Although AMPK signaling was originally
characterized as a tumor-suppressive signaling pathway,
emerging evidence suggests that AMPK has divergent
effects, and its role as an oncogenic regulator or tumor
suppressor is subject to many variables including tissue
model system [31]. mTOR, a downstream targets of
AMPK, functions as an intracellular nutrient sensor
to regulate protein synthesis and cellular growth and
block catabolic processes such as autophagy at the
post-translational and transcriptional levels [32]. Our
studies show that PA negatively regulated mTOR
signaling in prostate cancer cells in an AMPK dependent
manner (Figures 6 & 7). Reduced AMPK activity has
been reported to potentiate cancer cell growth through
inhibition of the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis
complex 2, known to suppress mTORC1 signaling,
thereby augmenting the oncogenic stimulus for
protein  synthesis responsible  for  uncontrolled tumor
cell growth [33].
PA induced autophagy in PC3 and NB26 but
not in DU145 prostate cancer cells (Figures 6 & 7).
Ouyang et al have shown that the autophagy pathway
is genetically impaired in DU145 cells with several
critical  autophagy-related proteins, such as ATG5 and
ATG12–ATG5 conjugates, being absent in this cell type
[34]. The role of autophagy in cancer is controversial and
still not completely clarified: it has been described as a
double-edged sword because it is involved in both cell
survival and tumor suppression, depending on cell type,
stage of tumor development, nature of the stressor and
genetic context [35]. Autophagy induced by PA seems
to be protective as we observed less cell death in PC3
and NB26 as compared to DU145 (Figure 3). However,
long term studies in animal models with or without the
use of an autophagy inhibitor will delineate the role of
PA induced autophagy in prostate cancer. Interestingly our
data indicate that PA-induced autophagy is independent of
AMPK, suggesting involvement of other pathways that are
the subject of our ongoing studies in in vitro and in vivo
models (Sup. Figure 7).
An important finding from our study is that AMPK
activation is necessary and sufficient for PA-mediated
suppression of tumor cell growth. These results are also
in agreement with findings which suggest that the role
of AMPK in cancer research is beyond its regulation of
metabolic activity [12, 36, 37]. Comparative studies of PA
with the widely used AMPK activator metformin suggest
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

different mechanism of actions of these compounds
(Figures 4 & 7). We found that metformin in combination
with PA reduced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells which
was more remarkable in PC3 cells. Since, metformin
inhibited PA induced AMPK activity, it is therefore not
surprising that PA-induced apoptosis, dependent on
AMPK, is compromised by metformin.
Taken together, our studies show that PA is a novel
compound, the potential pharmacological activities of
which have hitherto remained unexplored. It has both
anticancer and antidiabetic potential. The current study
demonstrates a novel AMPK-mediated pathway that
regulates cancer cell viability and growth in PA-treated
prostate cancer cells and identifies AMPK as a potent
therapeutic target of PA. Moreover, our results provide
biochemical and molecular underpinning for direct
targeting of AMPK in prostate cancer therapy given its
potential to induce cell death in prostate cancer cells.
Evaluation of the activity of PA in other preclinical models
of cancer is mandatory for its translation as an effective
agent against prostate cancer in clinical settings.

buffer was added lysis buffer. The composition of lysis
buffer was 50 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
ethyleneglycol-bis(aminoethylether)-tetraacetic acid, 1
mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 20 mM NaF, 100
mM Na3VO4, 0.5% NP-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4 with freshly added
protease inhibitor cocktail (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set
III, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Plates were placed on ice
for 30 min. The cells were scraped with the scraper and the
lysate was collected in eppendorf tube and passed through
needle of the syringe to break up the cell aggregates. The
lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14000g for 30 min
at 4°C and the supernatant (whole-cell lysate) was used or
immediately stored at −80°C. For western blotting 4-12%
poly acrylamide gels were used to resolve 30μg of protein,
transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with
appropriate monoclonal primary antibodies, and detected
by chemiluminescence autoradiography after incubation
with specific secondary antibodies.

The effect of treatment on clonogenic survival
of prostate cancer cells was determined using colony
formation assay. Prostate cancer cells (PC3, DU145 and
NB26) were treated with PA (20 & 40μM). Following
treatment, the cells were re-plated in triplicate on a 6-well
tissue culture plate with 5000 cells/well and cultured in
5% CO2 at 37°C for 8 days with growth media being
replaced with/without PA every 2 days. The cells were
then stained with 0.5% crystal violet (methanol: H2O; 1:1)
and pictures were taken.

Cell cycle analysis/Apoptosis by flowcytometry
Prostate cancer cells treated with PA (20
& 40μM:24h), trypsinized and fixed in 1%
Paraformaldehyde:1XPBS and washed thrice with PBS
and centrifuged. The pellet was suspended in chilled 70%
ethanol and stored overnight. The cells were labeled with
FITC and propidium iodide using the Apo-Direct Kit (BD
Pharmagen, CA) as per manufacturer’s protocol. Analysis
was performed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, NJ).
About 10,000 events per sample were collected and the
DNA histograms were analyzed with ModFitLT software
(Verily Software House, ME).

Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was carried out with
GraphPad prism (San Diego, CA) and p-values <0.05 were
considered significant.
