Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) results in complete regression of
advanced cancer in some patients, but the efﬁcacy of this potentially curative therapy may be limited by poor persistence of TIL
after adoptive transfer. Pharmacologic inhibition of the serine/
threonine kinase Akt has recently been shown to promote immunologic memory in virus-speciﬁc murine models, but whether this
approach enhances features of memory (e.g., long-term persistence) in TIL that are characteristically exhausted and senescent is
not established. Here, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of

Akt enables expansion of TIL with the transcriptional, metabolic,
and functional properties characteristic of memory
T cells. Consequently, Akt inhibition results in enhanced persistence of TIL after adoptive transfer into an immunodeﬁcient
animal model and augments antitumor immunity of CD8 T cells
in a mouse model of cell-based immunotherapy. Pharmacologic
inhibition of Akt represents a novel immunometabolomic
approach to enhance the persistence of antitumor T cells and
improve the efﬁcacy of cell-based immunotherapy for metastatic
cancer. Cancer Res; 75(2); 296–305. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

(4). This notion has also been corroborated by ﬁndings from
murine models of ACT in which there is a progressive loss of
antitumor function as T cells mature toward terminal differentiation (5). Therapeutic TIL isolated for ACT, however, are characterized by a terminally differentiated phenotype that is associated
with diminished antitumor activity and poor capacity for longterm persistence (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 6). Collectively,
these ﬁndings suggest that promoting immunologic memory in
TIL may enhance antitumor immunity and the curative potential
of ACT for advanced cancer.
Recent ﬁndings have highlighted the importance of the
PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway in regulating CD8 T-cell differentiation and memory formation (7–11). Akt coordinates transcriptional programs triggered by activation of the T-cell receptor
(TCR) and interleukin-2 (IL2) to drive expression of key adhesion
and cytolytic molecules that distinguish effector versus memory T
cells (12). Despite the canonical role of Akt in controlling glucose
metabolism in diverse cell types (13), there is emerging evidence
that it is not an obligate regulator of CD8 T-cell metabolism
(10, 14). It has been shown that constitutively active Akt promotes
cell growth and survival of CD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells
(15–17). More recently, it was shown that loss or reduction of Akt
signaling does not compromise T-cell proliferation or survival,
but causes differentiated cytotoxic T cells to transcriptionally
reprogram from an effector to memory phenotype (10).
The observation that Akt inhibition does not signiﬁcantly alter
metabolism and proliferation of CD8 T cells, but promotes a
transcriptional program that drives memory may be therapeutically important because response to ACT not only correlates with
features of immunologic memory, but also absolute number of

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is emerging as a curative therapy for
advanced cancer (1, 2). In previous ACT trials for patients with
metastatic melanoma, the following features of TIL have been
associated with objective response: long telomeres of infused
cells, expression of the memory-marker CD27, and persistence
of cells in circulation 1 month after transfer (3). These ﬁndings
suggest that transfer of TIL with features characteristic of memory
T cells may improve the efﬁcacy of ACT for advanced melanoma

Akt Inhibition Improves T-cell Antitumor Immunity

adoptively transferred TIL. We were therefore interested in exploring whether inhibition of Akt could promote features of memory
in tumor-inﬁltrating cytotoxic T cells without signiﬁcantly modulating metabolism or cell proliferation.
To evaluate this, we expanded TIL in the presence of a wellcharacterized allosteric inhibitor of Akt (18) that has previously
been used in murine cytotoxic T cells (10). We found that human
TIL cultured in Akt inhibitor demonstrate enhanced features of
immunologic memory that correlate with improved long-term
persistence after adoptive transfer. Although Akt inhibition did
not compromise TIL proliferation, we were somewhat surprised to
ﬁnd that it signiﬁcantly modulated the metabolic proﬁle of TIL.
Importantly, in a murine model of ACT, we show that Akt
inhibition improved antitumor immunity of cytotoxic T cells.
Taken together, these ﬁndings support the use of pharmacologic
approaches to enhance cell-intrinsic qualities of TIL that may
potentially augment antitumor immunity and improve the efﬁcacy of cell-based immunotherapy for advanced cancer (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Patients and Methods
Patient cell samples
Human cells used in this study were isolated from patients with
metastatic melanoma receiving treatment under institutional
review board–approved clinical protocols (NCT01319565 or
NCT00670748) in the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer
Institute. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Tumor-inﬁltrating T lymphocyte (TIL) cultures were expanded to
clinical-scale as previously described (19). Brieﬂy, tumor fragments
or digests were cultured in 6,000 IU/mL IL2 for 2 weeks, and
subsequently expanded with a rapid expansion protocol using
30 ng/mL OKT3 (anti-CD3) antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) and
6,000 IU/mL IL2 in the presence of irradiated (50 Gy) allogeneic
feeder cells at a 200:1 ratio of feeder cells to TIL. TIL culture media
was supplemented with 1 umol/L Akt inhibitor (PubChem Compound Identiﬁcation: 10196499, also called Akt inhibitor VIII or
Akti-1/2) purchased from Calbiochem. TIL were harvested for
myriad assays 30 days after initiation of culture, including FACS
analysis, coculture with tumor targets, microarray analysis, adoptive-transfer into NSG mice, and metabolomic analysis.
Mice and tumor lines
Thy1.1 and Ly5.1 Pmel-1TCR-transgenic (Pmel) mice have been
described previously (20). NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG)
mice and C57BL/6 N (B6) mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory and NCI Frederick. Mice were housed in the NIH
Clinical Research Center vivarium and maintained in compliance
with the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were excluded
from analysis if less than 6 weeks old and not age- and gendermatched with experimental cohort. Mice were randomized to
treatment group and investigators blinded when measuring outcomes of tumor size, survival after adoptive transfer, and histopathologic analysis. Splenocytes from Pmel mice were stimulated
with hgp10025-33 peptide (1 mmol/L) and 100 IU/mL recombinant
human IL2 (rhIL-2; Novartis) in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/
L AktI-1/2 (Akti; Calbiochem) and CD8þ T cells were harvested at
day 5. Secondary stimulation was performed using peptide-pulsed
irradiated B6 feeder cells. The B16F10 tumor line (B16) was
obtained from the National Cancer Institute tumor repository and
tested for mycoplasma contamination.

Gene expression analysis and cytokine production assays
For real-time RT-PCR, RNA was extracted with RNeasy Kits
(Qiagen) and cDNA was generated using High Capacity RNAto-cDNA Kits (Applied Biosystems). Real-time RT-PCR was
performed on a CFX96 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) using primer/probe sets for indicated genes and ACTB (Applied Biosystems). For cytokine production assays, coculture of TIL with
autologous tumor was performed and supernatants assessed for
the presence of gamma-interferon (IFNg) by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol.
Adoptive cell transfer
Tumor therapy was performed as described previously (20).
Brieﬂy, Pmel splenocytes were stimulated with hgp10025–33
peptide and expanded in rhIL-2 (1,000 IU/ml) to model clinical
protocol of expanding human TIL in high-dose IL2. Expanded
splenocytes (2  106) were subsequently transferred into irradiated (6 Gy) B6 mice with established subcutaneous B16
melanoma tumor and VVhgp100(1e7pfu) was administered
upon transfer. Intraperitoneal injections of rhIL-2 were administered twice daily for 3 days after transfer. To measure engraftment and homeostatic proliferation of murine Pmel CD8þ T
cells, 1  106 cells were adoptively transferred with coadministration of VVhgp100 (1e7pfu) into irradiated (6 Gy) B6 mice
after ex vivo stimulation (with hgp10025–33 peptide) and expansion in 100 IU/ml rhIL-2. Transferred cells were enumerated
with hemocytometer and FACS staining with conjugated antibodies (all from BD Pharmingen) with speciﬁcity against the
following: CD8 (catalog number 557654), CD27 (560691),
CD62L (553151), Thy1.1 (557266), and Ly5.1 (553775). To
measure engraftment and homeostatic proliferation of human
TIL, 1  107 cells were adoptively transferred into NSG mice
after ex vivo expansion as described above. Intraperitoneal injections of rhIL-2 were administered twice daily for 3 days after
transfer. Transferred cells were enumerated with hemocytometer
and FACS staining with conjugated antibodies with speciﬁcity
against the following: hCD3 (BD Biosciences 557694), hCD4
(Biolegend 317428), hCD8 (BD Biosciences 560179), and
hCD62L (Biolegend 304822).
Microarray analysis
Human TIL from 3 patients were isolated and expanded ex
vivo as described above. After 30 days expansion, T lymphocytes
were enriched for the CD8þ population by Miltenyi magnetic
column separation (order no. 130-096-495) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. RNA (100 ng) was extracted from
CD8þ TILs using Ovation Pico WTA System V2 (NuGEN)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, ﬁrst-strand
cDNA was synthesized using the SPIA tagged random and oligo
dT primer mix in 10-mL reactions after denaturation and incubated at 65 C for 2 minutes and priming at 4 C followed by
extension at 25 C for 30 minutes, 42 C for 15 minutes and
77 C for 15 minutes. Second-strand cDNA synthesis of fragmented RNA was performed using DNA polymerase at 4 C for 1
minute, 25 C for 10 minutes, 50 C for 30 minutes, and 80 C for
20 minutes. 50 double stranded cDNA was used as the template
for isothermal single-strand cDNA ampliﬁcation following a
cycle of DNA/RNA primer binding, DNA replication, strand
displacement, and RNA cleavage at 4 C for 1 minute, 47 C for
75 minutes, and 95 C for 5 minutes in a total 100-mL reaction.

Laboratory Animals (NIH publication no. 85-23; revised 1985). All

metastatic melanoma receiving treatment under institutional
review board–approved protocols in the Surgery Branch of the
National Cancer Institute. Informed consent was obtained from
all human subjects.

Results
Inhibition of Akt promotes expression of CD62L in human
tumor-speciﬁc cytotoxic lymphocytes without compromising
cell expansion
Akt is known to control lymphoid homing behavior of T cells
through regulation of the adhesion molecule CD62L (10). To test
whether Akt inhibition affects expression of CD62L on the surface
of human TIL, we used a well-characterized allosteric inhibitor of
all three isoforms of Akt (hereafter Akti; ref. 18). We ﬁrst sought to
conﬁrm whether Akti inhibits phosphorylation of Akt and downstream targets in human TIL. When measured at acute time points
after TCR stimulation, we found that phosphorylation of Akt is
inhibited at both the serine 473 and threonine 308 residues,
resulting in decreased phosphorylation of its downstream substrates ribosomal protein S6 (Fig. 1A) and glycogen synthase
kinase 3 beta (GSK3b; Supplementary Fig. S2). We then isolated
TIL from 3 patients with metastatic melanoma as previously
described (19), expanded them at clinical-scale in the presence
or absence of Akti, and measured surface expression of CD62L on
CD4þ and CD8þ T cells. We found that Akti-expanded TIL had
signiﬁcantly increased expression of CD62L (Fig. 1B). Strikingly,

300 Cancer Res; 75(2) January 15, 2015

however, we did not observe an effect of Akt inhibition on the
expansion of TIL (Fig. 1C). Finally, we sought to determine if Akt
inhibition compromises tumor speciﬁcity or capacity to release
IFNg when cocultured with autologous tumor cells. Akti-treated
TIL released similar levels of IFNg compared with conventional
TIL that was restricted in an MHC class I–dependent manner
(Fig. 1D). Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of Akt enables expansion of TIL expressing elevated levels of CD62L without affecting
their expansion or capacity to release IFNg upon recognition of
tumor targets.
Inhibition of Akt in human TIL promotes a transcriptional
signature of memory T cells
Expression of CD62L distinguishes antigen-experienced cells
with a central memory phenotype (22). In addition to their
lymphoid homing capacity, these cells exhibit enhanced capacity for cell survival and proliferation (5, 23, 24). Given elevated
expression of CD62L on the surface of Akti-expanded TIL, we
asked whether Akt inhibition causes global changes in gene
transcription that are characteristic of memory cells. To visualize the transcriptome of CD8þ TIL, we performed principle
component analysis (PCA) of microarray data and observed
segregation of treatment groups among the 3 patients under
study (Fig. 2A) Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression of 2,602 genes (P < 0.05) in Akti-treated TIL
compared with vehicle and hierarchical clustering analysis of
the expression of these genes enabled unsupervised segregation
of vehicle- and Akti-expanded TIL (Fig. 2B). It was particularly
striking that na€ve/memory-associated genes such as IL7R,
SELL, CD28, and CD27 were upregulated with Akt inhibition,
whereas effector-associated genes such as IFNG and KLRG1
were suppressed (Fig. 2C; ref. 25). To extend our interpretation

Akt Inhibition Improves T-cell Antitumor Immunity

Figure 4.
Therapeutic TIL isolated from patients with melanoma have poor mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity that is augmented with pharmacologic inhibition of
Akt. Human TIL isolated from indicated patients were stimulated ex vivo using agonistic anti-CD3 (OKT3) antibody and irradiated allogeneic feeders and
expanded to clinical-scale for 30 days with high dose IL2 in the presence or absence of Akt inhibitor. An XF24 extracellular analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) was used
to measure OCR of Akti-treated and vehicle TIL in real time under basal cell culture conditions (after 30 days in culture) and in response to indicated inhibitors
at acute time points. FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-(triﬂuoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone; R&A, rotenone and antimycin A. Spare respiratory capacity is maximal
respiration (after FCCP) minus basal respiration. Data are representative of three independent experiments for each patient.

beyond single-gene analysis, we performed GSEA using genes
upregulated in human na€ve (CD62Lþ CD45RAþ) compared
with effector memory (CD62L CD45ROþ) CD8þ T cells
isolated from healthy donors. We found that Akti-treated TIL
have enhanced expression of na€ve-associated genes and
decreased expression of effector memory-associated genes (Fig.
2D). Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that pharmacologic
inhibition of Akt enables expansion of CD8þ TIL with transcriptional properties characteristic of memory cells.
Akt inhibition is associated with enhanced fatty-acid oxidation
in human cytotoxic TIL
There is increasing evidence that memory T cells have metabolic qualities such as reduced glycolysis (26) and enhanced
mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) that support longterm survival and effector function (27). Having shown that
pharmacologic inhibition of Akt in CD8þ TIL promotes a
transcriptional proﬁle characteristic of memory T cells, we
asked whether Akt inhibition affects metabolism of human
CD8þ TIL. Using a well-established gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometrybased approach (28–29), we observed that pharmacologic
inhibition of Akt modulates several metabolic pathways as
evidenced by clear segregation of treatment groups in principal
component analysis of more than 360 detected metabolites
(Fig. 3A). It has previously been reported in a murine model
that Akt is largely dispensable for glucose metabolism of
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (10). Consistently, we observed a
modest increase in glucose and glucose 6-phosphate in Aktitreated TIL and somewhat diminished 3-phosphoglycerate
levels (Fig. 3B), suggesting relatively little impact of Akt inhibition on glycolytic metabolism. With regard to FAO, however,
Akti-treated CD8þ TIL showed accumulation of both longchain and polyunsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 3C) that may be
a result of membrane lipid turnover used to fuel FAO. This
interpretation is supported by accumulation of phospholipid
catabolites and elevated lysolipid levels (Fig. 3D). Another
possibility is that enhanced lipid accumulation in Akt-treated
TIL was merely due to decreased cell growth and expansion, but
this seems less likely because we did not observe any difference
in absolute cell numbers after culture (Fig. 1A). Thus, although
inhibition of Akt during expansion of TIL does not affect the

www.aacrjournals.org

abundance of glycolytic metabolites, it results in changes in
abundance of metabolites involved in FAO.
Inhibition of Akt augments mitochondrial spare respiratory
capacity in human TIL
Spare respiratory capacity (SRC) is a measure of the bioenergetic ability of mitochondria to produce additional energy
under conditions of increased stress or work and is thought
to be vital for the long-term survival and function of diverse
cell types (21, 30–31). Recent work has demonstrated that
mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity (SRC) is critical for
longevity memory CD8þ T cells (32). Because SRC in memory
CD8þ T cells is dependent on mitochondrial FAO, we wondered whether Akt inhibition augments SRC in human TIL.
By using an extracellular ﬂux analyzer, we characterized the
metabolism of therapeutic TIL in real time by measuring O2
consumption rates (OCR), an indicator of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS; ref. 21). We found that Akti-treated TIL had
slightly higher basal OCR when compared with vehicle (Fig.
4A). To further characterize the bioenergetic proﬁle of TIL, we
challenged TIL with a well-established "mitochondrial stress
test" in which oligomycin (to block ATP synthesis) is added
after measurement of basal OCR, followed by ﬂuorocarbonyl
cyanide phenylhydrazone or FCCP (to uncouple ATP synthesis
from the electron transport chain, ETC), and ﬁnally by coadministration of rotenone and antimycin A (to block complex I
and III, respectively, of ETC; refs. 29, 33, 34). Akti-treated TILs
demonstrated a considerably higher mitochondrial SRC compared with vehicle controls as indicated by the difference
between basal OCR and maximal OCR (after FCCP injection;
Fig. 4A). This is consistent with earlier studies in which elevated
FAO fuels enhanced SRC in memory T cells (29). Collectively,
these ﬁndings are consistent with the hypothesis that Akti
induces a metabolic program in human TIL similar to that of
memory T cells whereby increased FAO supports enhanced
mitochondrial SRC.

long-lived memory T cells. We therefore hypothesized that
Akti-treated TIL may be capable of enhanced long-term persistence. To test this, we performed a clinical-scale expansion
of conventional and Akti-treated TIL. At the end of ex vivo
expansion, both treatment groups were comprised of a similar
proportion of CD8þ T cells, and Akti-treated TIL had enhanced
expression of CD62L (Supplementary Fig. S3). We transferred
conventional and Akti-expanded human TIL into NOD.CgPrkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice (Fig. 5A) and observed
superior engraftment and persistence of Akti-treated cells 30
days after transfer in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs
(Fig. 5A). Thus, in a humanized mouse model, Akti-treated
human TIL have enhanced persistence and this correlates
with phenotypic, metabolic, and transcriptional features of
memory.
Previous studies have demonstrated that CD8þ T cells with
the capacity to persist after adoptive transfer mediate more
effective antitumor responses in both mice and humans receiving ACT (3, 23, 26, 35). Accordingly, we endeavored to evaluate
the persistence and antitumor function of Akti-expanded
tumor-speciﬁc T cells using the Pmel-1 mouse model in which
transgenic T cells express a T-cell receptor speciﬁc for the
melanoma-associated antigen, hgp100, widely expressed in
B16 melanoma (20). Consistent with our ﬁndings in TIL from
patients with melanoma, we found that Akt phosphorylation is
inhibited at both the serine 473 and threonine 308 residues,
resulting in decreased phosphorylation of its downstream
target ribosomal protein S6 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Akti-

treated Pmel-1 T cells showed a gene-expression proﬁle (Supplementary Fig. S5) and surface phenotype (Supplementary
Fig. S6) reminiscent of long-lived memory T cells. Moreover,
global metabolomic analysis showed that Akti-treated Pmel
CD8þ T cells possessed a distinct metabolic signature characterized by augmented FAO (Supplementary Fig. S7).
To evaluate the effect of Akt inhibition on the cell-intrinsic
capacity of tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells to engraft and persist
following adoptive transfer, we cotransferred a 1:1 mixture of
vehicle and Akti-expanded Pmel-1 TCR-tg cells that can be distinguished using congenic markers and tracked their kinetics
following adoptive transfer into mice. Strikingly, Akti-treated cells
expanded to greater numbers and persisted to form a long-lived
population of memory cells that could be detected in lymphoid
and nonlymphoid organs 600 days following adoptive transfer
(Fig. 5B and C).
To test whether Akti-treated CD8þ T cells are capable of superior antitumor immunity, we individually transferred vehicle or
Akti-expanded Pmel-1 CD8þ T cells into sublethally ablated
recipients bearing established B16 melanoma tumors and measured tumor growth and survival following transfer. Consistent
with human TIL, Akti-treated Pmel-1 T cells exhibited superior
persistence and trafﬁcking to the tumor microenvironment (Fig.
6A) and produced similar levels of IFNg compared with vehicle
(Fig. 6B) that correlated with decreased tumor growth (Fig. 6C)
and improved survival (Fig. 6D). Thus, consistent with their
transcriptional and metabolic characteristics, Akti-expanded cells
exhibit enhanced persistence upon adoptive transfer that

correlates with augmented tumor regression and survival following ACT.

Discussion
The principle aim of this study was to determine if pharmacologic inhibition of Akt promotes features of memory T cells in
TIL isolated from patients with advanced cancer. Because there is
considerable evidence in animal models and human trials that
memory T cells mediate superior regression of tumor (5), we also
wanted to evaluate if inhibition of Akt enhances antitumor
immunity of adoptively transferred CD8þ T cells. We found that
Akt inhibition promotes a gene expression signature and metabolic proﬁle characteristic of long-lived memory T cells, and this
was associated with enhanced persistence and antitumor immunity. Enhancing "memory" of adoptively transferred TIL has been
a long-standing therapeutic goal of cell-based immunotherapy for
metastatic cancer. Although the reasons for this observation
remain speculative, it is thought that sheer bulk of tumor in
patients with advanced cancer requires transfer of TIL with a

capacity—much like long-lived memory T cells—to persist long
after their initial encounter with antigen (36, 37).
After antigen activation, diverse signals from the TCR and
costimulatory receptors converge on the Akt signaling pathway
to drive effector differentiation (8). Cytokine signaling such as
IL2 further sustain Akt activity (12), driving CD8 T cells toward
terminal differentiation at the expense of memory formation.
It has previously been shown in a murine model that exposure
to Akt inhibitor 48 hours after TCR activation promotes
memory-associated gene expression and lymph node-homing
of CD8þ T cells (10). Here, we wanted to further characterize
the impact of Akt inhibition on bona ﬁde cytotoxic T cells
isolated from the tumor microenvironment of patients with
advanced cancer.
We used a variety of approaches—metabolomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic—to characterize the global effect of Akt
inhibition on human cytotoxic T cells. Consistent with earlier
studies in murine virus-speciﬁc CD8 T cells (8, 10), we observed
that Akt inhibition signiﬁcantly alters the transcriptome of
human TIL and promotes a global signature enriched for genes

in memory and na€ve T cells. This ﬁnding is especially intriguing in light of recent evidence that CD8þ T cells from the tumor
microenvironment have been characterized as terminally differentiated and exhausted (6). The ﬁnding in this study that
Akti-treated TIL demonstrate enhanced expression of na€veassociated genes raises the possibility that characteristically
exhausted and senescent TIL (6) may undergo "reprogramming," at least at a population level, that endows a renewed
capacity for long-lived persistence.
Akt inhibition is known to promote immunologic memory
in virus-speciﬁc murine T cells (10). It is also known that
memory T cells rely on fatty-acid oxidation (38) and mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity (29) for long-term survival
and function. It remains unclear, however, whether Akt itself
plays a role in the metabolic fate of antigen-experienced CD8þ
T cells. In spite of the canonical role of Akt in facilitating
glucose metabolism in diverse cell types (39), a recent study
in cytotoxic T cells shows that Akt is largely dispensable for Tcell metabolism (10). Consistent with these ﬁndings, we
observed little difference in key glycolytic metabolites between
Akti-treated TIL and controls. We performed a global metabolomic analysis, however, that suggests Akt inhibition modulates
fatty acid oxidation in cytotoxic TIL. Further analysis using realtime cellular bioenergetic studies also shows that Akt inhibition
enhanced mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity. Taken
together, ﬁndings from our analysis suggest that pharmacologic
inhibition of Akt may modulate metabolic programs of antigen-experienced T cells.
Although the ﬁndings suggest that pharmacologic inhibition
of Akt may induce considerable plasticity in the metabolic and
transcriptional programs of a population of terminally differentiated cytotoxic T cells, future studies using genetic
approaches are required to validate and further characterize
the role of Akt in T-cell differentiation and metabolism. In
spite of these limitations, the results of the present study show
that pharmacologic inhibition of Akt promotes a gene expression signature and metabolic proﬁle characteristic of longlived memory T cells and this is associated with enhanced
persistence and antitumor immunity. More importantly, these
ﬁndings could form the basis for novel immunometabolomic
approaches to improve cell-intrinsic features of therapeutic TIL
that may enhance the clinical efﬁcacy of cell-based immunotherapy for advanced cancer.
