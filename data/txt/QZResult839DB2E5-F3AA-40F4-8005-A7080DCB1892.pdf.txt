Abstract
Topoisomerase I (Top1) relaxes DNA supercoiling by forming transient cleavage complexes (Top1cc) up- and
downstream of transcription complexes. Top1cc can be trapped by carcinogenic and endogenous DNA lesions
and by camptothecin, resulting in transcription blocks. Here, we undertook genome-wide analysis of camptothecin-treated cells at exon resolution. RNA samples from HCT116 and MCF7 cells were analyzed with the Affy
Exon Array platform, allowing high-resolution mapping along 18,537 genes. Long genes that are highly expressed
were the most susceptible to downregulation, whereas short genes were preferentially upregulated. Along the
body of genes, downregulation was most important toward the 30 -end and increased with the number of exon–
intron junctions. Ubiquitin and RNA degradation-related pathway genes were selectively downregulated. Parallel
analysis of microRNA with the Agilent miRNA microarray platform revealed that miR-142-3p was highly induced
by camptothecin. More than 10% of the downregulated genes were targets of this p53-dependent microRNA. Our
study shows the profound impact of Top1cc on transcription elongation, especially at intron–exon junctions and
on transcript stability by microRNA miR-142-3p upregulation. Cancer Res; 73(15); 4830–9. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is essential in higher eukaryotes.
It is required to relax DNA supercoiling generated by transcription, replication, and chromatin remodeling (1). Topoisomerase
I relaxes both positive and negative supercoiling by producing
transient topoisomerase I cleavage complexes (Top1cc), which
are topoisomerase I-linked DNA single-strand breaks (1).
Top1cc, which are normally very transient are the target of
camptothecin and its clinically used anticancer derivatives,
topotecan, irinotecan, and belotecan (1, 2). The drugs bind at
the enzyme–DNA interface and block DNA religation, thereby
leading to the trapping of Top1cc (1, 3). The trapped Top1cc are
converted into lethal DNA lesions when their slow religation
interferes with the progression of transcription and replication
complexes (4, 5), leading to collisions that generate irreversible
DNA breaks (1, 6–8). Those breaks activate multiple responses
including cell-cycle checkpoints, speciﬁc transcription factors, S
and G2 arrest, and ultimately cell death (9). Trapping of Top1cc
can also be generated in the absence of drug treatment when the

DNA template contains endogenous and exogenous DNA damage such as abasic sites, mismatches, oxidized bases, carcinogenic adducts, and nicks (10, 11).
Beside topoisomerase I DNA untwisting activity, which is
critical during transcription elongation for the dissipation of
transcription-dependent supercoiling (12, 13), topoisomerase I
is closely linked to transcription in at least 2 other ways: at
promoters, it can act as transcription regulator and at exon–
intron junctions as splicing cofactor. Indeed, topoisomerase I
has been identiﬁed as a cofactor for activator-dependent transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II; ref. 14) and for
the formation of active TFIID–TFIIA complexes (15). This
promoter activity is independent of topoisomerase I unwinding
activity. Topoisomerase I implication in splicing stems from the
discovery that it can phosphorylate serine/arginine-rich (SR)splicing proteins (16) and that it can shift from its classical DNA
untwisting activity to kinase activity after binding the SRsplicing factors (17). Moreover, trapping of Top1cc by camptothecin and topoisomerase I inactivation have been shown to
impact RNA splicing (18–22) and generate alternative transcripts (23). Recently, camptothecin treatment has also been
shown to preferentially alter the splicing of splicing-related
factors, such as RBM8A, generating transcripts coding for
inactive proteins lacking key functional domains (24), as well
as to reactivate the transcription of the ubiquitin protein ligase,
UBE3A, which is implicated in Angelman syndrome (25).
Here, we report the genome-wide effects of camptothecin
on gene expression using the exon array platform that allowed a high-resolution mapping of transcripts for 18,537 individual genes. We used the same treatment protocol recently
reported to map the impacts of camptothecin on genome-wide
splicing (24).

Genome-Wide Gene Expression after Top1 Poisoning

Materials and Methods
Differential analysis using R package LIMMA
We used 2 main steps for analysis: (i) differential microarray
analysis and (ii) the analysis of the probe set genome location for
top differentially expressed probe sets. The microarray analysis
was conducted using packages available in R Bioconductor
(versions available in June 2011). We ﬁrst normalized the data
using the RMA package (26). We deﬁned 3 groups (late—15 and
20 hours, early—1, 2, and 4 hours, and control—4 and 20 hours)
and conducted differential analysis between groups using linear
models and empirical Bayes methods provided by Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) package (27).
The mapping of the probes to the human genome (37.1) was
obtained using Bowtie (28) and probe sets with all member
probes uniquely mapped to the genome were kept. The distance
of a probe set to 50 end of the corresponding gene was obtained
by using the genome start position of the probe set and the
position of the 50 end of the gene was obtained from Entrez
Gene. The distance was normalized to a value between 0 and 1.
The distribution of the normalized distances for the top
10,000 differentially expressed (upregulated or downregulated)
probe sets was obtained using density plot.
Chemicals and cells
Camptothecin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Human
HCT116, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection, grown in DMEM (Invitrogen;
HCT116, MCF7) or RPMI (Invitrogen; MDA-MB-231), and supplemented with 10% FBS (Gemini Bio-products) at 37 C in 95%
air and 5% CO2. p53þ/þ and p53/ HCT116 cells were kind gifts
from Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center; ref. 29).
miRNA inhibitor or miRNA mimic transfection
142-3p inhibitor, 142-3p mimic, miScript inhibitor negative
control, and negative control siRNA were from Qiagen (catalogue numbers MIN0000434, MSY0000434, 1027271, and
1027310). Negative control siRNA was used as a control microRNA (miRNA) mimic. Cells were seeded at the density of 400,000
cells per well in 2.3 mL of medium containing serum, shortly
before transfection. For each sample, 400 pmol of miRNA
inhibitor (or 40 pmol of miRNA mimic) were mixed with 100
mL culture medium without serum (mixture A). Then 12 mL of
HiPerfect (Qiagen) was added to mixture A and incubated for 10
minutes at room temperature to allow the formation of transfection complexes. Finally, the complexes were added to the
cells, after 24 hours the medium was replaced with regular
medium and the cells were incubated for a further 24 hours.
siRNA
For topoisomerase I downregulation, cells were transfected
with siRNA duplex (Qiagen) against the sequence AAGGACTCCATCAGATACTAT from the topoisomerase I mRNA. A negative control siRNA duplex was obtained from Qiagen (target
DNA sequence: AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT). Cells were
seeded in 6-well plates, at a density of 150,000 cells per well 16 h
before transfection. For each sample, 500 pmol of siRNA were
mixed with 250 mL Optimem (Invitrogen; mix A). Five mL
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were mixed with 250 mL of

www.aacrjournals.org

Optimem and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature
(mix B). After mixing A and B and further incubation for
20 minutes at room temperature, the siRNA/lipofectamine
complexes were added in 2 mL culture medium. After 5 hours,
the medium was replaced with regular medium and cells were
incubated for a further 72 h. BCL2L1 siRNAs were obtained
from Qiagen (SI03025141) and Ambion (s1921). MAP3K7IP2
siRNAs were obtained from Qiagen (SI03107685) and Ambion
(s23074). For BCL2L1 and MAP3K7IP2 siRNAs, transfections
were carried out in 384-well plates. Brieﬂy, 20 mL of serum-free
media containing Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life Technologies;
0.05 mL) was added to wells containing siRNA (0.8 pmol). Lipid
and siRNA were allowed to complex for 45 minutes at ambient
temperature before addition of 600 cells in RPMI-20% FBS to
yield ﬁnal transfection mixtures containing 20 nmol/L siRNA
in RPMI-10% FBS. Camptothecin [0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)] was added 48 hours posttransfection and viability
was assayed 72 hours later.
Reverse transcription PCR
Cells were washed in PBS. RNA extraction was carried out
with the Nucleospin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel). The OneStep
RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) was used as previously described (24).
Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Cells were washed in PBS. RNA extraction was carried out
with the Nucleospin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel). Real-time RTPCR was conducted with the QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR
Kit (Qiagen) on the ABI 7900 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems).
Expression level of gene of interest was normalized by b2
microglobulin RNA level of the same sample. Reaction mixtures
contained 5 mL of 2 QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR Master
Mix, 0.5 mL of QuantiFast RT Mix, and 50 ng of template RNA in a
ﬁnal volume of 10 mL containing primers (Proligo) at 1 mmol/L.
Relative gene expression was expressed as 2DDCt ðDDCt ¼
DCtsample  DCt calibrator ; DCt ¼ Ctgene  Ctb2microglobulin Þ. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Quantitative PCR for miRNA
Cells were washed in PBS. RNA extraction was carried out
with the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). An aliquot of 1
mg of RNA was reverse transcribed using the miScript Reverse
Transcription Kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR was conducted with
the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) on the ABI 7900
thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). The expression level of hsamiR-142-3p was normalized by the RNU1A RNA level of the same
sample. Reaction mixtures contained 10 mL of 2 QuantiTect
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and 1 mL of reverse-transcriptase–
generated cDNA in a ﬁnal volume of 20 mL containing miScript
Universal Primer and miScript Primer Assay (Qiagen). Relative
gene expression was expressed as 2DDCt ðDDCt ¼ DCtsample 

Results
Global gene expression alterations induced by Top1cc
The Affy Exon Array (GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array)
allows in depth analysis of 18,537 genes with approximately 4
probes per exon and an average of 40 probes per gene. It can
also be used to determine overall "gene-level" expression by
averaging multiple probes on different exons. We puriﬁed total
RNA from human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells treated with
10 mmol/L camptothecin for 1, 2, 4, 15, and 20 hours (Fig. 1A),
and conducted exon array analysis for each sample. Controls
samples treated with DMSO (0.1%; the solvent used to dissolve
camptothecin) were analyzed at 4 and 20 hours (Fig. 1A).
Nonresponsive probes were removed and only genes with 10
or more remaining probes were included in the analysis (all the
data are in GEO; accession number GSE37352; http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc ¼ GSE37352).
Overall 3,808 genes (20% of all genes) were downregulated
(by 2-fold or more) after camptothecin treatment, whereas 835
genes (5% of all genes) were upregulated (by 2-fold or more; Fig.
1B; see Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). At early time treatments (1, 2, and 4 hours), only few genes were differentially
expressed; it was mostly at late times (15 and 20 hours) that
transcripts were up- or downregulated (Fig. 1B).
Top1cc preferentially downregulate highly expressed
genes and upregulate genes with low expression
First, we analyzed whether differential gene expression
responses were linked to the basal expression level of the
genes. Basal expression for a given gene was determined as

4832

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

the average between the expression values for the 2 controls
(4- and 20-hours DMSO treatment). After ranking all the
genes in the array in term of transcript expression under
baseline untreated conditions, we divided them in 10 groups
of equal size based on their basal expression level. We then
looked at the number of down- (Fig. 2A) and upregulated
genes (Fig. 2B) in each group. The most highly expressed
genes were the most downregulated both at early times (1,
2, and 4 hours camptothecin treatment) and at late times
(15- and 20-hours treatment; Fig. 2A). By contrast, the
upregulated genes both at early and late times were those
with lowest expression before camptothecin treatment
(Fig. 2B).
Impact of gene length on transcriptional down- and
upregulation
Next, we analyzed the impact of gene length on Top1ccinduced up- and downregulation. Figure 3A shows that the
gene density curve for the downregulated genes is shifted to the
right compared with the gene density curve for all the genes,
meaning that the downregulated genes were the longest genes.
On the other hand, the gene density curve for the upregulated
genes was shifted to the left, meaning that the upregulated
genes were the shortest (Fig. 3A). The median gene length for
the overall genome (24 kb) increased to approximately 66 kb
for the downregulated genes and decreased to approximately 7
kb for the upregulated genes (Fig. 3B). These results show that
the long genes are selectively downregulated, whereas the
short genes are selectively upregulated.
Downregulation is predominant at the 30 -end of genes
The exon array platform allowed us to test whether the genes
were downregulated or upregulated differentially along their

Genome-Wide Gene Expression after Top1 Poisoning

Figure 2. Effect of Top1 poisoning on gene expression is correlated with the basal gene expression level. A, downregulation of highly expressed genes by
camptothecin. The basal expression level for a speciﬁc gene corresponded to the average between the log2 expression value for the controls (4 and 20 hours
DMSO treatment). The genes in the array were ranked according to transcripts levels. Genes were divided in 10 groups of same size depending on their basal
expression level (1,745 genes by group). Then we determined the proportion of downregulated genes in each group. The x-axis corresponds to the average
basal expression level for each of the 10 groups of genes. The y-axis corresponds to the number of downregulated genes in each group. Top, plot for the 217
"early" downregulated genes (downregulated within 4 hours of camptothecin exposure). Bottom, plot for the 3,759 "late" downregulated genes

length. For this purpose, we plotted the density of the 10,000
top differentially expressed probes (up- and downregulated)
and 10,000 random probes, depending on their distance from
the 50 -end of the gene. Our analysis showed that the downregulated probes were preferentially located at the 30 -end of
genes compared with random probes, and this effect was
accentuated at late time treatments (Fig. 4A and B, left).
Conversely, for the upregulated genes, the probes that were
upregulated had a preference for the 50 -end of the genes at
early times. However, they had the same location than random
probes at late times (Fig. 4A and B, right). To test whether the
observed increase at 50 ends of genes (Fig. 4A, right) may
inﬂuence the tendency of short genes to be upregulated by
camptothecin, we took the 131 early upregulated genes,
separated them in 2 groups based on their length (short
genes: less than 24,566 bases; long genes: 24,566 bases or
more), and looked at the upregulation mean of their 50 probes
(probes located in the ﬁrst 1,000 bases of the gene) compared
with the upregulation mean of the other probes (probes
located after the ﬁrst 1,000 bases of the gene). For the early
short upregulated genes, we obtained the same upregulation
for both the 50 probes and the other probes: 1.63 and 1.64,
respectively, indicating that camptothecin -induced gene
upregulation is not solely based on accumulation of 50 probes
for short genes.

Both gene length and exon–intron junctions are related
to transcripts downregulation
Figure 5A shows that the probability for a gene to be
downregulated increased with the number of exons. Conversely, intronless genes or genes with few exons had a higher
probability to be upregulated (Fig. 5A and B). The median
number of exons is 9 for the overall genome of HCT116 cells,
while it was 14 for the downregulated genes and 4 for the
upregulated genes. Thus, downregulated transcripts originated from long genes with a high number of exons.
Because long genes also contain high number of exons, we
analyzed the importance of exon–intron junctions. To eliminate the gene length parameter, we divided genes in groups of
same size that differed only by the number of exons (Fig. 5C). By
applying this correction, we observed that downregulation
increases when genes have more exons. This ﬁnding is not
limited to the 2 speciﬁc groups shown in Fig. 5C; it is general for
different groups of genes with matched lengths (Supplementary Fig. S1).
In addition, to examine gene length and eliminate the exons
number parameter, we compared genes with same exons
number but different length (Fig. 5D). The proportion of downregulated genes was higher in long genes. Together these data
show that both the length of a gene and the frequency of exon–
intron junctions per gene are linked to its downregulation.

observed with the Affy Exon Array (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and S4B) was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D).
To differentiate whether the transcriptional effects of camptothecin were related to Top1cc or to topoisomerase I inactivation, we compared the effects of topoisomerase I downregulation by siRNA versus camptothecin treatment with
whole-genome transcript analyses by Affy Exon Array (the
data are in GEO; accession number GSE37352). By contrast
to camptothecin, downregulation of topoisomerase I had only
limited impact on gene expression. Only few genes were up
(DDIT4L) or downregulated (SLC16A6, CPA4) following topoisomerase I downregulation, indicating that the generation of
Top1cc rather than topoisomerase I inactivation is responsible
for inducing differential gene expression. Moreover, contrary
to camptothecin treatment, topoisomerase I silencing did not
downregulate the ubiquitin-related genes, CUL5 and UBE2W
(see Supplementary Fig. S5). These results indicate the importance of Top1cc for the transcriptional effects of camptothecin.

genes of the array (18,537 genes) are represented in green, red, and
black, respectively. B, median and average of gene length (in bases) for
the downregulated genes, the upregulated genes, and all the genes of the

Preferential downregulation of the RNA degradation
and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis genes
Gene ontology analyses of the 3,808 genes upregulated by
camptothecin in HCT116 cells showed signiﬁcant correlations
for the oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome and p53 signaling
pathways (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We also analyzed by Affy
Exon Array the response of the breast carcinoma MCF7 cells
treated with camptothecin (Fig. 1C; all the data are in GEO;
accession number GSE37352; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/query/acc.cgi?acc ¼ GSE37352). One hundred genes were
upregulated in MCF7 cells. They correspond to the p53 signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and cell-cycle–related genes. These results conﬁrm that the p53 signaling pathway
is transcriptionally upregulated in both HCT116 and MCF7
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2), which is consistent with the p53
status of those 2 cell lines (30).
Among the most signiﬁcant GO categories for the genes
downregulated after camptothecin treatment in HCT116 cells
are the RNA degradation and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
categories, two categories that are also present for the genes
that are downregulated in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Table
S4). Supplementary Fig. S3A shows the large number of genes
implicated in RNA decay, and Supplementary Fig. S3B shows
that the CNOT genes are mainly downregulated at late time
treatments. We conﬁrmed the Affy Exon Array data by reverse
transcription (RT)-PCR experiments (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
It is noteworthy that downregulation was detectable at 2 hours
by quantitative (q)RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Similarly,

p53-dependent miR-142-3p upregulation as a novel
mechanism of genomic downregulation and
camptothecin-induced cell death
In parallel to the Affy Exon Array, we conducted Agilent
miRNA microarray (8  15K version 3) analyses in human colon
carcinoma HCT116 cells treated with camptothecin for 1, 2, 4, 15,
and 20 hours (see Fig. 1; the data are in GEO; accession number
GSE37358; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc
¼ GSE37358). Only few miRNA were affected by camptothecin
treatment. miR-142-3p was among the most signiﬁcantly upregulated miRNAs (Fig. 6A and B). This miRNA has 1,329 predicted
target genes including the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis gene
family. Moreover, 415 of these predicted target genes were
downregulated by camptothecin treatment (c2 with Yates correction, P value < 0.0001). We conﬁrmed by PCR that CUL5 and
UBE2W, 2 of the predicted target genes from ubiquitin-mediated
proteolysis gene family, were effectively downregulated by miR142-3p mimic (Fig. 6C) and camptothecin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4C and Fig. 6D). To conﬁrm that the downregulation of CUL5 and UBE2W after camptothecin treatment
was due to the upregulation of miR-142-3p, we used an inhibitor
of miR-142-3p in our experiments. As expected, the miR-142-3p
inhibitor strongly counteracted the downregulation of CUL5
and UBE2W (Fig. 6D). Because the 50 ﬂanking region of miR-1423p contains a p53 binding sequence (Fig. 6E; ref. 31), we tested
whether p53 was functionally related to miR-142-3p upregulation. For this purpose, we compared p53þ/þ or p53/
HCT116 cells. The upregulation of mir-142-3p was delayed in
p53/ cells compared with p53þ/þ cells (Fig. 6F). Altogether,
these results showed that p53-dependent miR-142-3p upregulation could be involved in the downregulation of 10% of the
downregulated genes after camptothecin treatment.
As for camptothecin, the surexpression of miR-142-3p was
cytotoxic (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Moreover, downregulation by siRNA of BCL2L1 and MAP3K7IP2, 2 genes that are
downregulated after camptothecin treatment and are targeted
by miR142-3p, increased camptothecin sensitivity by 25-fold
(Supplementary Fig. S6B and S6C). Altogether, our data show

least 2-fold) more than one-ﬁfth of the genome. We show that
this inhibition can be explained by the combination of 3
mechanisms: (i) Top1cc-mediated transcription arrest along
the body of genes with incremental effect toward the 30 -end of
long genes, (ii) presence of high number of exon–intron junctions that tend to arrest transcript elongation, and (iii) upregulation of at least one speciﬁc miRNA, miR-142-3p that
downregulates a large number of survival genes.
miRNAs target the 30 untranslated region (30 UTR) of genes
(32). Perfect or near-perfect base pairing with the target RNA
promotes cleavage of the RNA (33). miRNA that are partially
complementary to their target genes can also promote their
deadenylation, causing mRNA destabilization and degradation
possibly starting at the 30 -end of the transcripts (34). Upregulation of miR-142-3p can be invoked for the downregulation of

more than 400 of the total 3,800 genes downregulated by
camptothecin, including genes coding for ubiquitin pathways,
and which respond in a coordinated manner to camptothecin
treatment. Although other miRNA were known to be upregulated by DNA damage responses [miR-34a (35, 36), miR-34c
(37), miR-192, miR-215 (38, 39), miR-16-1, miR-143, and miR145 (40)], in our analysis, only miR-142-3p was overexpressed
signiﬁcantly after camptothecin treatment. On the basis of
the presence of a p53 binding sequence, upstream from the
miR-142-3p, and the impact of p53 knockout on miR-142-3p
induction after camptothecin treatment, we conclude that
miR-142-3p is a novel p53-dependent miRNA. It is also likely
that miR-142-3p is upregulated by DNA damage independently
of p53 as it has been recently reported to be upregulated by
ionizing radiation in M059K glioblastoma cells, TK6 human B
lymphoblast cells, and Jurkat lymphoblast acute T-cell leukemia cells (41, 42), which are p53 defective.
At least 2 other mechanisms (besides miR-142-3p discussed
above) are involved in the Top1cc-induced transcription inactivation. First, our exon array analyses show an overall presence of aborted transcripts in camptothecin-treated cells. This
result is consistent with earlier studies by Kann and Kohn who
reported that camptothecin shifts pulse-labeled RNA to lower

molecular weight (43). More recently, using 3H-uridine pulselabeling, Ljungman and Hanawalt also showed that camptothecin inhibits elongation by Pol II in the dihydrofolate reductase
gene (4). Our genome-wide analyses generalize these earlier
results by showing preferential truncation of long transcripts.
In addition, we show that gene upregulation was conﬁned to
short transcripts. Aborted transcripts produced by premature
chain termination may have profound cellular effects. The
simplest mechanism for the formation of abortive transcripts
in camptothecin-treated cells is Pol II arrest at trapped Top1cc.
Pol II is rapidly arrested by Top1cc (4, 44) with reduction of Pol
II density at promoter pausing sites (45), activation of low
abundance antisense RNA (23), and rapid hyperphosphorylation of Pol II (46). The role of Top1cc rather than topoisomerase
I inactivation by sequestration at Top1cc is supported by the
fact that topoisomerase I siRNA had a much weaker effect than
camptothecin treatment (see Supplemental Fig. S5).

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

Our study reveals another mechanism related to exon–
intron junctions for the generation of aborted transcript.
Indeed, transcript downregulation was signiﬁcantly correlated
to the number of exon–intron junctions in camptothecintreated cells (see Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus,
it seems that the trapping of Top1cc might be particularly
deleterious on exon–intron junctions, which is plausibly based
on the known involvement of topoisomerase I in RNA splicing.
The splicing alterations generated by camptothecin could
produce premature stops and generate instable transcripts
subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD;
refs. 21, 24, 47). Recently, an ExonHit Array on the RNA samples
used in the present study (see protocol in Fig. 1A) showed that
camptothecin preferentially affected the splicing of splicingrelated factors. The preferential effect of camptothecin on
genes encoding splicing factors may explain the abnormal
splicing of a large number of genes in response to Top1cc

of camptothecin-induced Top1cc at or near intron–exon junctions for camptothecin-induced transcription stalling and
splicing alterations.
We found several pathways signiﬁcantly downregulated in
camptothecin-treated cells: ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis,
cell cycle, RNA degradation, basal transcription factors, TGFb,
and immune response signaling (see Supplementary Table S4).
Downregulation of cell-cycle–related genes leading to growth
arrest is a well-known effect of Top1cc (48). The sensitivity of
RNA-related genes has recently been noted by Lotito and
colleagues (49). Unexpectedly, the most signiﬁcantly enriched
gene category in our study is ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.
Downregulation of ubiquitin pathways is unexpected as ubiquitylation is a major component of the DNA damage response
and a prerequisite to Top1cc repair (11). Overexpression of
CUL3, a component of an SCF (Skip1-Cul-F-Box) E3 ligase, has
been shown to increase topoisomerase I ubiquitylation and
subsequent degradation resulting in camptothecin resistance
(50). However, in our study, CUL3 and many other ubiquitin
genes are downregulated, consequently the DNA breaks are
not repaired, contributing to the cytotoxicity of Top1cc.
In summary, our exon-speciﬁc gene expression study of the
whole-human genome in response to Top1cc provides novel
insights in the transcriptional effects of Top1cc. At least 3
mechanisms seem to coexist to inactivate gene expression
in camptothecin-treated cancer cells: miRNA upregulation
by DNA damage responses, transcript elongation arrests by
trapped Top1cc, and exon–intron junction interference by
Top1cc. Moreover, cells that are targeted by camptothecin
seem to selectively inactivate several key pathways involved
at least in ubiquitin metabolism, cell cycle, and RNA stability
and to upregulate miR-142-3p, which downregulates survival

genes. These ﬁndings are relevant not only for basic cell biology
as Top1cc form in response to endogenous and exogenous
DNA lesions but also for cancer therapeutics as Top1cc-targeted drugs are routinely used for various human cancers.
