BACKGROUND: The treatment of recurrent transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) remains an unmet clinical
need. This study assessed lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and HER-2, as second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TCC. METHODS:
This was a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, prospective phase 2 study. Patients with TCC whose disease
progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy received lapatinib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with evaluations for response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria
performed every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint of the current study was objective tumor response rate.
Secondary endpoints included safety, time to disease progression, and overall survival. RESULTS: Fifty-nine
patients were enrolled in the study, 25 of whom (42%) could not be evaluated for response. The primary
endpoint of an objective response rate (ORR) >10% was observed in 1.7% (95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 0.0%-9.1%) of patients; however, 18 (31%; 95% CI, 19%-44%) patients achieved stable disease (SD). The
median time to disease progression and overall survival (OS) were 8.6 weeks (95% CI, 8.0 weeks-11.3
weeks) and 17.9 weeks (95% CI, 13.1 weeks-30.3 weeks), respectively. Clinical benefit (ORR and SD) was
found to be correlated with EGFR overexpression (P ¼ .029), and, to some extent, HER-2 overexpression.

Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is a chemosensitive disease that is responsive to chemotherapy including
platinum chemotherapy.1-3 Cisplatin-based chemotherapy
is the primary treatment modality for patients with locally
advanced or metastatic TCC.4 Although a regimen of
methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin
(MVAC) is reported to achieve objective response rates
(ORRs) of up to 70% and a median overall survival (OS)
ranging from 10 to 16 months,5-7 only 3.7% to 15.0% of
patients remain continuously disease free after treatment
for advanced TCC.8,9 Despite the finding that patients
who fail to respond to the initial MVAC demonstrate a
response to the reintroduction of MVAC chemotherapy,10
the majority of patients with advanced TCC ultimately develop disease recurrence and eventually die of the disease.11
Treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) alone
confers a similar survival advantage to MVAC, but with a
superior safety and tolerability profile.5,12-16 GC has
become the first-line treatment for patients with locally
advanced or metastatic TCC in many institutions.
The relatively high response rate to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy and its limited impact on time to disease
progression (TTP) and survival leaves a significant patient
population in need of salvage therapy, and therefore these
patients remain of high unmet medical need.2,4,17 In several single- and multiple-agent trials in this setting,
response rates ranged between 0% and 30%, and survival
advantage remains to be elucidated.18-24
Tyrosine kinase receptors play a crucial role in the
pathobiology of many solid tumors, making them a
potential target for novel anticancer agents.25 The epidermal growth factor receptors 1 and 2 (EGFR and HER-2)
are frequently overexpressed in bladder TCC and are associated with a poor prognosis.26-29 Lapatinib is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits both EGFR and HER230-32 and represents a rational approach to managing
TCC. In bladder cancer cell lines, lapatinib is a potent in2882

hibitor of epidermal growth factor–induced activation of
HER-2 signaling.33
This study evaluated the clinical activity and tolerability of oral lapatinib as second-line treatment for
patients with locally advanced or metastatic TCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
This was a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, prospective
phase 2 study. Eligible patients were aged 18 years, and
had histologically confirmed measurable locally advanced
or metastatic TCC with documented disease progression after first-line platinum-based therapy. Patients were required
to have Karnofsky performance status of 70, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within institutional normal
limits assessed by a multigated acquisition scan or echocardiography, and adequate organ function (granulocyte count
>1500/mm3, platelet count >100,000/mm3, hemoglobin
>9 g/dL, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin
<1.5 times upper limit of normal [ULN], and alanine aminotransferase <3 times ULN). Prior systemic neoadjuvant
and/or adjuvant therapies were permitted. Confirmed 1þ,
2þ, or 3þ expression of EGFR and/or HER-2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was required before enrollment.
Patients were excluded from the study if they had history of
another malignancy, active central nervous system metastases, diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that might interfere
with absorption of study medication, or a history of severe
cardiovascular disease, and if they had received prior therapy
with EGFR or HER-2 inhibitors.
Study Design and Treatment Plan
Patients received oral lapatinib (Tykerb/Tyverb, GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, UK) at a dose of 1250 mg once
daily. Treatment was continued until disease progression,
withdrawal from the study because of unacceptable

toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Dosage reduction to
1000 mg/day was permitted in cases of drug-related toxicity grade 3 as defined by National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) (version 2.0).
Treatment delay was also allowed for up to 2 weeks to
allow for resolution of laboratory abnormalities. All
patients were followed for survival.
The study was performed in compliance with Good
Clinical Practice and the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by each of
the local Ethics Committees and regulatory agencies, and
all patients provided written informed consent.

Study Evaluations and Statistical Plan
All patients were evaluated for response every 8 weeks
according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumors.34 Radiologic scans were independently reviewed
centrally. All adverse events (AEs) were recorded and
graded using NCI-CTC criteria. Standard clinical chemistry and hematology parameters were monitored every 4
weeks, and cardiac function assessments were performed
every 8 weeks.
The expression of EGFR (PharmDx) and HER-2
(HercepTest) were detected by IHC using DakoCytomation kits (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, Calif). The testing was performed centrally in a blinded, independent
manner by Quest Diagnostics using archival paraffinembedded tissue taken from primary and/or metastatic tumor sites. EGFR/HER-2–negative tumor was defined as
the absence of membranous staining above background in
all tumor cells. EGFR/HER-2–positive tumor (1þ, 2þ,
and 3þ) was defined as any membranous staining of the
cell above background level of the cell in >10% of the tumor cells. A tumor with an intensity score of 2þ or 3þ was
classified as an EGFR- or HER-2–overexpressing tumor.
The primary endpoint of the study was an ORR of
>10%. An ORR of 10% was considered to be of little
clinical benefit (null hypothesis), and an ORR of 25%
was considered worthy of further, larger confirmatory
clinical trials (alternative hypothesis). The Green and
Dahlberg 2-stage design provided an overall sample size of
55 patients, with a stopping rule to allow early termination of the study at the end of stage 1 if there was less than
3 responders of the first 30 subjects; otherwise the study
would proceed to stage 2 and recruit the remaining 25

subjects. A 1-sided exact test based on the binomial distribution was used to compare the ORR with the null hypothesis; if the P value was <.055, the null hypothesis
would be rejected.35 Other endpoints included clinical
benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR],
stable disease [SD]), TTP, and OS.
TTP was defined as the time from treatment start
until the first documented sign of disease progression or
death from any cause; OS was defined as the time from
first treatment until death from any cause. TTP and OS
were estimated using Kaplan-Meier techniques, and 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
All the analyses were based on the intent-to-treat
(ITT) patient population, which comprised all patients
who enrolled in the study and received the study drug.
The per-protocol population was defined as all patients
who had documented disease progression after failure on
platinum-based therapy and who received no more than 1
line of chemotherapy in a metastatic setting, as well as
having baseline scans. This population was used for a
more accurate estimation of the clinical benefit.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between November 2002 and July 2004, 83 patients were
screened and 59 patients (42 men and 17 women) were
subsequently accrued from 29 centers in Europe. All 59
patients were included in the ITT efficacy and safety populations. Patient characteristics at the time of screening
for the ITT population are summarized in Table 1.
Because of rapid enrollment, full accrual was met before
the first 30 subjects reached the required follow-up period
of at least 16 weeks that would have triggered the conduct
of the interim analysis.
The most common first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen was GC (37 patients; 63%), whereas
MVAC was used for 6 (10%) patients. Gemcitabine was
given as a monotherapy in 3 (5%) patients. The majority
of patients (37 patients; 63%) had a short progressionfree interval of 6 months after previous therapy; of these,
20 (34%) patients developed disease progression within 1
to 3 months from prior therapy. Sixteen (27%) patients
developed disease progression between 6 months and 1
year; and only 6 (10%) patients had a long-term

Clinical Activity
Of the 59 patients included in the ITT analysis, 34 (58%)
were assessable for response to treatment with lapatinib
by the independent review, whereas 25 (42%) patients
were deemed nonevaluable by independent review;
22 (37%) patients withdrew before first assessment at
Week 8 due to disease progression in 13 (22%) patients, serious AE (SAE) in 7 (12%) patients, consent withdrawal in
1 (2%) patient, protocol violation in 1 (2%) patient, and
incomplete baseline or follow-up scans in 3 (5%) patients.
The ORR was observed in 1.7% (95% CI, 0.04%9.10%) of patients. Eighteen (31%) patients achieved
SD; of those, 5 (8%) patients achieved a minimal response
in pelvic masses, and liver and lung metastases, as confirmed by the independent review (Table 2). Three (10%)
patients who had initial PR at Week 8 were subsequently
classified as having SD or progressive disease (PD) at the
follow-up scans at Week 16. On the basis of the observed
ORR, the stopping rules for the study would have been
met, and enrollment into the study should have been
stopped prematurely. Because enrollment had been completed before the conduct of the interim analysis, the stopping rule could not be applied.
Clinical benefit (ORR and SD) was maintained for
8 weeks in 19 (32%; 95% CI, 21%-46%) patients, and

whose disease overexpressed EGFR and/or HER-2 had a

Safety
Table 4 summarizes the most frequently reported AEs in
the safety population (reported by 5% of the study
population). The most common grade 3 and/or 4 AEs
were vomiting (7%), diarrhea (3%), dehydration (3%),
and hyponatremia (3%). Asymptomatic relative decrease
in LVEF (27%) was reported in 1 patient after 2 months
of lapatinib therapy, which was considered by the investigator to be potentially related to lapatinib therapy. Three
other nonfatal serious AEs were considered by the investigators to be possibly related to lapatinib (grade 3 and 4
diarrhea, and grade 2 vomiting). AEs of any cause led to
treatment discontinuation in 8 patients. Five patients died
from SAEs; the primary causes of death as reported by the
investigator were febrile neutropenia, cardiac arrest, enterostomy suture leakage, metastatic neoplasm, and exacer2886

bated dyspnea. Only the enterostomy suture leakage was
considered by the investigator to be possibly related to
lapatinib.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first clinical
trial to report an EGFR/HER-2 inhibitor as second-line
monotherapy in patients with TCC. Lapatinib was found
to be well tolerated in this advanced patient population,
with an AE profile that was consistent with previous studies of lapatinib in other tumor types.36,37 The most common AEs were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and decreased
LVEF.
The primary endpoint of an ORR >10% was not
met in this study. However, nearly one-third of patients
(32%) experienced clinical benefit. The median TTP and
median OS of 8.6 weeks and 17.9 weeks, respectively, are
similar to those observed in previously reported studies.38
Although TCC is considered to a chemosensitive tumor,
it is important to acknowledge that the disease can
become progressively resistant or refractory to treatment.
This is demonstrated in the current study, because only
32% of patients achieved an objective response on previous chemotherapy, which is lower than generally expected
with GC or MVAC.5,9,39
To our knowledge, there currently is no approved
treatment for recurrent TCC after first-line therapy, and
therefore it continues to present a real challenge to oncologists. Results from previous trials have demonstrated
limited to modest clinical activity with varied response
rates ranging between 0% and 30% with single agents,
including gemcitabine, pemetrexed, taxanes, and ifosfamide.18,23,38,40-43 In a study of gemcitabine in 35 previously treated patients, Lorusso and Pollera38 reported an
ORR of 22.5% (95% CI, 8%-37%) and a median survival of 5 months (range, 2 months-21þ months). Pemetrexed has also been evaluated as a single agent with
various results. In 1 study, an ORR of approximately 28%
and a median OS of 9.6 months18 contrasted markedly
with an ORR of 8% reported in a similar study in the
second-line setting.41 Studies assessing paclitaxel in this
setting have also demonstrated few or modest effects. In a
study in 14 patients, only 1 PR (7%) was observed,43 and
in another study 3 PRs (10%) were reported.40 More
recently, vinflunine and best supportive care (BSC) were

compared versus BSC in 357 patients. The ORR and progression-free survival (PFS) were reported to be significantly higher than in the control arm (P ¼ .0002 and P ¼
.001, respectively).44 In another study, the combination
of gemcitabine and paclitaxel for 6 cycles (Group A) was
compared with maintenance treatment (Group B) in 102
patients. The median PFS and OS were 4.5 months and
7.8 months, respectively, in Group A and 3.3 months and
7.4 months, respectively, in Group B (P ¼ .5554 and P ¼
.3595). The overall response rates of 34.5% in Group A
and 50.0% in Group B were not significantly different.45
These data further emphasize the need to develop robust
clinical trial designs.
One of the limitations of the current study is the
presence of a high incidence of protocol violation, with
the enrollment of patients with multiple lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. However, on analysis of
the per-protocol patient population, a very similar clinical
activity was observed with lapatinib, which could be
explained by either an inherent lack of activity to lapatinib
or the enrollment of patients with disease refractory to further therapy and hence with poorer prognosis. The latter
provides a more plausible explanation, given that clinical
benefit was demonstrated in 36% of the patients with
lapatinib. Indeed, several studies indicate that multiple
risk factors are predictive of poor outcome such as performance status, visceral metastases, or response to prior
chemotherapy.8,46-48 These patients are expected to have
a lower rate of objective response.
In the current study, the patient population had a
high prevalence of multiple poor prognostic factors.
Nearly all patients had metastatic disease at the time of
presentation, with 49% and 27% of the patients presenting with lung and liver metastases, respectively. In addition, 51% of the patients had a Karnofsky performance
status 80. Therefore, a lack of response to first-line
chemotherapy, and the observed short TTP, not only
indicate poor prognosis on subsequent therapy, but could
also be an important factor to consider for a better defined
patient selection and/or more aggressive therapy.
The results of the current study highlight some of
the challenges in designing clinical trials for targeted
agents. Another limitation in the current study is the early
withdrawal of 22 patients before the first assessment at
Week 8. This reflects the importance of considering TTP
on prior therapy and frequency of disease assessment in
Cancer

poor prognosis patients. More importantly, ORR may
not be the most appropriate endpoint for assessing the
activities of targeted agents, whereas disease stabilization
can be sufficient in the palliative setting.49,50 Our knowledge of trial design for targeted agents has greatly
advanced since the time the current study was designed
and conducted; TTP and PFS are more relevant endpoints that have been increasingly adopted in clinical
trials.51
The findings of the current study suggested a greater
clinical benefit in patients with EGFR or HER-2 overexpression, and demonstrated a significant prolongation of
median OS (30.3 weeks) compared with the ITT population (17.9 weeks) or patients with low expression of
EGFR or HER-2 (10.6 weeks), which compares favorably
with other reports.40 These observations, in conjunction
with the importance of EGFR and HER-2 overexpression
as poor prognostic predictors in patients with TCC,27
highlight the need for improved patient selection for a
better clinical outcome.
The evolving understanding of the molecular biology of bladder cancer has resulted in the investigations of
several novel targets in this disease using either single
agents or combinations of chemotherapy. Investigators in
the Cancer and Leukemia Group B conducted a phase 2
study (CALGB 90102) evaluating the addition of gefitinib (at a dose of 500 mg/day) to GC in untreated patients
with advanced TCC. The ORR and median TTP in this
trial were similar to those observed in other studies of GC
and MVAC chemotherapy.52 A phase 2 trial that evaluated trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine was conducted in 109 patients
with advanced HER-2 overexpressing TCC (defined by
IHC or fluorescence in situ hybridization). The ORR was
70%, with 5 patients achieving a CR. The TTP and median OS were 9.3 months and 14.1 months, respectively.53 Emerging data have demonstrated the activity of
multitargeted agents in TCC. In a single-arm phase 2 trial
of sunitinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
inhibitor, in 45 patients with recurrent TCC, the ORR
was 7% (3 patients), with minimal response and SD
achieved in 12 (27%) patients.54 Ongoing trials are currently evaluating the role of sunitinib either as a maintenance or as neoadjuvant therapy.55
In conclusion, the low response rate reported in the
current study indicates modest activity with lapatinib.

Nevertheless, the study was considered to be negative
because it did not meet its primary endpoint. However,
an improvement in OS in a subset of patients with
EGFR-overexpressing and/or HER-2–overexpressing
tumors is encouraging and suggests that a more defined
population could benefit from lapatinib therapy. Therefore, the authors believe that future trials should still
include all comers, but stratify patients according to the
expression status of EGFR or HER-2. A follow-up study
has begun to assess lapatinib activity as a maintenance
treatment in patients who responded to first-line chemotherapy for advanced TCC. In addition, a phase 1 study
of lapatinib in combination with GC chemotherapy in
patients with advanced TCC is ongoing. A window of opportunity study is underway to examine the biologic
effects of short-term lapatinib before primary surgery of
resectable TCC.
