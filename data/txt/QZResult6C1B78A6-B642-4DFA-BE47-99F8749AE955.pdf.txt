ABSTRACT
Gastric carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies and the third highest
cause of global cancer-related death. Notch2 receptor intracellular domain (N2IC),
the activated form of Notch2 receptor, enhances gastric carcinogenesis. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) act as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors in tumorigenesis and crosstalk with Notch pathways. Herein, microRNA-23b (miR-23b) was identified as a Notch2
receptor-related miRNA and its role in gastric carcinogenesis was investigated. Levels
of miR-23b in stomach adenocarcinoma samples were down-regulated, whereas those
of Notch2 receptor, v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (Ets1), and
E2F1 transcripts were up-regulated. Results also showed that N2IC down-regulated
miR-23b expression in gastric cancer cells through up-regulating E2F1. The miR-23b
inhibited gastric tumorigenesis including growth, viability, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, and abilities of colony formation, migration, invasion, and tumorsphere
formation. Mechanistically, miR-23b suppressed tumor progression and pluripotency
gene expression and affected tumorsphere ultra-structure in gastric cancer cells via
targeting Notch2 receptor or Ets1. Furthermore, miR-23b diminished the xenografted
tumor growth and lung metastasis of SC-M1 gastric cancer cells through Notch2
pathway. Our results suggest that Notch2 pathway and miR-23b interplay in a
reciprocal regulation loop in gastric cancer cells and this axis plays an important
role in gastric carcinogenesis.

receptor intracellular domains, the activated forms of
Notch receptors. Notch receptors act as oncogenes or tumor
suppressors in controlling tumorigenesis [2, 3]. In gastric
cancer cells, Notch1 and Notch2 receptor intracellular
domains (N1IC and N2IC, respectively) enhance
carcinogenesis through up-regulating cyclooxygenase-2
[4, 5]. Furthermore, Notch2 receptor mRNA is up-regulated
in the population of cancer stem cells [6].

INTRODUCTION
Gastric carcinoma is the third leading cause of global
cancer mortality [1]. The regulatory mechanisms modulating
aggressiveness of gastric cancer are incompletely
elucidated. There are four Notch receptors (Notch1–4)
in mammals [2, 3]. Notch receptors are activated after
cleavage induced by ligand-binding to release their Notch

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs
that bind to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of target
mRNAs [7, 8]. A growing body of evidence indicates
that miRNAs function as either oncogenes or tumor
suppressors in the development and progression of human
malignancies [8, 9]. Notch pathways regulate expressions
of a number of miRNAs, while several miRNAs modulate
levels of the components in Notch pathways [10, 11]. For
example, Notch1 pathway interplays with several miRNAs
in cancer cells [10, 12]. The Notch3-regulated miR-223
represses the tumor suppressor FBXW7 in T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia [13]. Additionally, miR-34 family
down-regulates Notch1 and Notch2 levels in gastric cancer
cells [14] and also inhibits self-renewal of pancreatic
cancer stem cells via directly modulating Notch1 and
Notch2 receptors [15]. miR-107 suppresses growth and
metastasis of brain tumor cells through down-regulating
Notch2 receptor [16, 17]. Notch2 pathway/miR-205
reciprocal regulation loop regulates mammary stem cell
fate [18]. These results showed a significant cross-talk
between Notch pathways and miRNAs in carcinogenesis.
In the present study, we sought to search for the Notch2
receptor-related miRNAs which are involved in controlling
tumor development and progression of gastric cancer
cells. miR-23b was identified as a Notch2 receptor-related
miRNA and its role in controlling gastric tumorigenesis
was further investigated.

in stomach adenocarcinoma specimens from patients
with gastric cancer advanced stages II–IV, compared with
early stage I, whereas levels of miR-23b were decreased
(Figure 1B). The miR-23b-27b-24-1 cluster is composed
of miR-23b, miR-27b, and miR-24-1. We also found that
levels of miR-27b but not miR-24-1 with rare expression
were suppressed in gastric cancer samples (Supplementary
Figure S1A) and inhibited in those specimens from patients
with advanced stages (Supplementary Figure S1B).
Additionally, the quantitative real-time PCR
analysis was employed on gastric cancer samples and
the corresponding adjacent normal tissues of gastric
cancer patients to examine their clinical relevance. Levels
of miR-23b were lower in stomach adenocarcinoma
specimens than in their corresponding normal tissue
counterparts, but those of Notch2 receptor, E2F1, and Ets1
mRNAs were higher (Figure 1C). Notably, the miR-23b
expressions were dramatically down-regulated in lymphnode tumor samples from 11 gastric cancer patients with
lymph node metastasis. The relationship between levels
of miR-23b and Notch2 receptor, E2F1, and Ets1 mRNAs
in the tumor samples from 21 gastric cancer patients was
analyzed using the Pearson correlation analysis. The
relative miR-23b levels were inversely proportional to the
expressions of Notch2 receptor, E2F1, and Ets1 mRNAs
in stomach adenocarcinoma specimens (Figure 1D).
Moreover, the relative levels of Notch2 receptor, E2F1 and
Ets1 mRNAs in these samples were positively correlated
with those of each other (Figure 1E).

RESULTS
Levels of miR-23b are down-regulated in
stomach adenocarcinoma samples, whereas
transcripts of Notch2 receptor, Ets1, and
E2F1 are up-regulated

N2IC down-regulates miR-23b expression
in gastric cancer cells
To confirm the N2IC-mediated miR-23b suppression,
miR-23b levels were examined in N2IC-expressing
SC-M1/myc-N2IC-His cells, and Notch2 receptorknocked down SC-M1/Notch2i cells by analysis of miRNA
quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 2A). Results showed that
miR-23b expression was decreased by N2IC overexpression,
whereas increased by Notch2 receptor knockdown.
To evaluate whether four Notch pathways suppress
miR-23b expression by inhibiting its promoter activity,
reporter plasmid containing miR-23b-27b-24-1 promoter
was co-transfected with constructs of Notch receptor
intracellular domains into SC-M1 cells for reporter gene
assay (Figure 2B). Only the exogenous N2IC significantly
inhibited the activity of miR-23b-27b-24-1 promoter
among four Notch receptor intracellular domains.
Using search engines PROMO and TFSEARCH to
identify transcription factor-binding sites [22, 23], there are
putative E2F1-binding sites in human miR-23b-27b-24-1
promoter (Supplementary Figure S2A). As demonstrated
previously [24], miR-23b-27b-24-1 promoter activity
was suppressed by c-Myc, a downstream target of Notch
pathway [25–28]. Because c-Myc and E2F1 activate each
other’s transcription [29, 30], we checked whether Notch2

To identify the Notch2 receptor-related miRNAs
in gastric cancer cells, miRNA quantitative real-time
PCR analysis was performed in N2IC-expressing human
stomach adenocarcinoma SC-M1 cells (SC-M1/mycN2IC-His cells) and control cells. We found that miR-23b
was the most potent Notch2 pathway-suppressing miRNA
(data not shown). To survey whether any  significant
difference of levels of miR-23b and Notch2 receptor
mRNA exists in stomach adenocarcinoma specimens
compared with those of normal tissues, data from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed.
Furthermore, mRNAs of the known cellular factors
regulating gastric carcinogenesis were also examined
including E2F1 [19, 20] and Ets1 [21].
Results showed that expressions of miR-23b were
significantly down-regulated in numerous stomach
adenocarcinoma samples compared with normal
counterparts, whereas those of Notch2 receptor, E2F1,
and Ets1 mRNAs were up-regulated (Figure 1A).
According to stage classification, mRNA expressions of
Notch2 receptor and Ets1 but not E2F1 were increased

analysis using anti-Notch2 C-terminal (C-ter), anti-E2F1, anti-Ets1, and anti-GAPDH antibodies (lower). The intensities were quantified
using Multi-Gouge V3.0 and then normalized to the internal control GAPDH. The results were calibrated to levels of the detected proteins
in SC-M1 cells. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation. D. As described above, the correlation among miR-23b, N2IC, E2F1, and

gastric cancer cells. Data showed that E2F1 and c-Myc
expressions were enhanced in N2IC-expressing SC-M1/
myc-N2IC-His cells, whereas decreased in Notch2 receptorknocked down SC-M1/Notch2i cells by quantitative realtime PCR and Western blot analyses (Supplementary

after transfection with siRNA vectors against E2F1 into
SC-M1 cells (Supplementary Figure S2C). The N2ICmediated miR-23b suppression was relieved by E2F1
knockdown when SC-M1 cells were co-transfected with
N2IC-expressing construct and siRNA vectors against E2F1.

The relative levels of endogenous miR-23b in
seven human gastric cancer cells were also determined
using miRNA quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 2C,
upper). miR-23b was expressed in SC-M1, AGS,
KATO III, and NCI-N87 cells but hardly detected in
AZ521, NUGC-3, and SNU-16 cells. Results of Western
blot analysis showed that N2IC, E2F1, and Ets1 were
differentially expressed in these cells (Figure 2C, lower).
Using the Pearson correlation analysis, the relative
miR-23b levels were inversely proportional to N2IC,
E2F1, and Ets1 expressions in these cells (Figure 2D,
left), whereas the relative levels of N2IC, E2F1, and
Ets1 were positively correlated with those of each other
(Figure 2D, right).

were increased in NUGC-3 as well as AZ521 cells scarcely
expressing miR-23b and SC-M1 cells expressing miR-23b
after infection with miR-23b-expressing adenoviruses
as compared with those infected with green fluorescent
protein (GFP)-expressing adenoviruses. Alternatively, the
antagomir-23b reagent, chemically modified antisense
RNA oligonucleotides, was used to inhibit the function of
miR-23b and to address the role of endogenous miR-23b
in gastric carcinogenesis. Transient transfection with 50 or
100 nM of antagomir-23b significantly knocked down
miR-23b expression in SC-M1 cells (Supplementary
Figure S4). To explore whether miR-23b regulates growth
of gastric cancer cells, trypan blue exclusion method
and MTT assay were employed. After infection with miR23b-expressing adenoviruses, the cumulative numbers
of NUGC-3 and AZ521 cells were reduced (Figure 3A).
The cumulative numbers of SC-M1 cells were increased
after transfection with antagomir-23b (Figure 3A). Results
of MTT assay showed that the viabilities were inhibited
by miR-23b overexpression in NUGC-3 and AZ521 cells,
but increased by miR-23b knockdown in SC-M1 cells
(Figure 3B).

miR-23b inhibits growth and progression
of gastric cancer cells
To study the roles of miR-23b in gastric
tumorigenesis, miR-23b-expressing adenoviral system was
established. As revealed by miRNA quantitative real-time
PCR analysis (Supplementary Figure S3), miR-23b levels

To evaluate whether miR-23b regulates gastric
cancer progression, NUGC-3 and AZ521 cells were
infected with miR-23b-expressing adenoviruses for
overexpression and SC-M1 cells were transfected with
antagomir-23b for knockdown and used for the subsequent
colony formation, migration, and invasion assays.
Progression abilities were diminished after miR-23b
overexpression in NUGC-3 and AZ521 cells (Figure 3C,
left), whereas augmented after miR-23b knockdown in
SC-M1 cells (Figure 3C, right).

cells with adherent growth property were infected with
miR-23b-expressing adenoviruses, and the infected cells
had a slightly packed morphology compared with those
infected with GFP-expressing adenoviruses (Figure 4A).
Expressions of epithelial markers E-cadherin and
plakoglobin were enhanced along with the decreased
levels of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin, and
Twist by miR-23b overexpression in SC-M1 and AZ521
cells using Western blot analysis (Figure 4B). Interestingly,
the blockade of pluripotency genes including CD44,
Nanog, Oct4, and SOX-2 was also exerted by miR-23b
overexpression (Figure 4B). The mRNA levels of these
pluripotency genes in SC-M1 cells were inhibited by miR23b overexpression, but enhanced by miR-23b knockdown
(Figure 4C). Data of reporter gene assay showed that
the activities of Nanog, Oct4, and SOX-2 promoters
were inhibited by miR-23b overexpression (Figure 4D).

miR-23b suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and sphere formation ability
of gastric cancer cells
Next, we sought to check whether miR-23b
regulates EMT of gastric cancer cells. SC-M1 and AZ521

24 or 48 hours for morphological examination. Bar, 50 μm. B. Whole-cell extracts of the infected SC-M1 (left) and AZ521 (right) cells were
prepared for Western blot analysis using anti-E-cadherin, anti-plakoglobin, anti-N-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-Twist, anti-CD44, anti-Nanog,
anti-Oct4, anti-SOX-2, and anti-GAPDH antibodies. C. After infection with adenoviruses expressing miR-23b or GFP or transfection with
100 nM antagomir-23b (anti-miR-23b) or scrambled control (-) into SC-M1 cells, the transcript levels of CD44, Nanog, Oct4, and SOX-2 were
measured by quantitative real-time PCR and then normalized to GAPDH. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. D. After transfection with
reporter plasmids Nanog-Luc (Nanog), Oct4-Luc (Oct4), or SOX-2-Luc (SOX-2) for 24 hours, SC-M1 cells were infected with adenoviruses
expressing miR-23b or GFP for 24 hours for reporter gene assay. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. E. After infection with adenoviruses expressing
miR-23b or GFP or transfection with 100 nM antagomir-23b or scrambled control into SC-M1 cells for 48 hours, the treated cells were seeded
and then incubated for 9 days for tumorsphere formation assay. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation.

Furthermore, tumorsphere formation ability of SC-M1
cells was repressed after miR-23b overexpression, whereas
enhanced after miR-23b knockdown (Figure 4E).

Nanog, Oct4, and SOX-2 mRNAs was performed. Data
showed that the mRNA levels were elevated by N2IC in
tumorspheres of SC-M1/myc-N2IC-His cells (Figure 6A)
and by Ets1 in those of SC-M1 cells transfected with
Ets1-expressing construct (Figure 6B), but downregulated by miR-23b in those of control cells. The miR23b-suppressed mRNA levels of these pluripotency genes
were mitigated by N2IC and Ets1 overexpressions in
tumorspheres of SC-M1/myc-N2IC-His cells (Figure 6A)
and SC-M1 cells (Figure 6B), respectively.
There is a microvilli-like structure in tumorsphere
surface of SC-M1 cells [31]. The effect of miR-23b
on tumorsphere ultra-structure in SC-M1 cells was
also examined by scanning electron microscope.
Results showed that miR-23b overexpression
reduced the microvillus extension in tumorsphere surface
of SC-M1 cells and affected the tumorsphere ultrastructure (Figure 6C). N2IC and Ets1 overexpressions
increased the microvillus extension in SC-M1/mycN2IC-His cells (Figure 6D) and SC-M1 cells (Figure 6E),
respectively. The miR-23b-mediated reduction of
microvillus extension and induction of morphological
change in tumorspheres were partially rescued by N2IC
and Ets1 overexpressions in SC-M1/myc-N2IC-His cells
(Figure 6D) and SC-M1 cells (Figure 6E), respectively.

miR-23b attenuates progression of gastric cancer
cells through Notch2 pathway or Ets1
To identify miR-23b targets, in silico analyses were
employed to search for mRNA 3′-UTRs containing the
putative miR-23b-binding sites. Using widely used software
including DIANAmT, miRDB, PicTar, RNAhybrid, and
TargetScan6.2 algorithms, there are conserved putative
miR-23b-binding sites in Notch2 receptor (Supplementary
Figure S5, left) and Ets1 (Supplementary Figure S5, right)
3′-UTRs. Protein levels of N2IC and Ets1 were decreased
by miR-23b overexpression in SC-M1, AZ521, and
NUGC-3 cells (Figure 5A).
To further check whether miR-23b targets
Notch2 receptor and Ets1 3′-UTRs, reporter gene assay
was performed. After transfection with the reporter
plasmids containing human Notch2 receptor or Ets1
3′-UTRs, reporter gene activities were attenuated by
miR-23b overexpression in SC-M1 cells (Figure 5B).
These data clearly demonstrate that miR-23b regulates
Notch2 receptor and Ets1 expressions through targeting
their 3′-UTRs.
It was found that Notch2 pathway [4] and
Ets1 [21] contribute to gastric cancer progression
and metastasis. To delineate whether the miR23b-suppressed progression of gastric cancer cells is
through down-regulating Notch2 receptor or Ets1, the
miR-23b-insensitive N2IC-expressing SC-M1/mycN2IC-His cells and SC-M1 cells transfected with miR23b-insensitive Ets1-expressing construct were infected
with miR-23b-expressing adenoviruses for the subsequent
tumorsphere formation, colony formation, migration, and
invasion assays. N2IC and Ets1 overexpressions elevated
progression abilities of SC-M1/myc-N2IC-His cells
and SC-M1 cells, respectively (Figure 5C). The miR23b-repressed progression abilities in the treated cells were
relieved by N2IC or Ets1 overexpressions. Alternatively,
Notch2 receptor knockdown in SC-M1/Notch2i cells
or Ets1 knockdown in SC-M1 cells transfected with
siRNA vectors against Ets1 impaired progression
abilities (Figure 5D). The miR-23b knockdown-mediated
increment of progression abilities in the treated cells was
abolished after Notch2 receptor or Ets1 knockdowns.

miR-23b diminishes tumor growth and lung
metastasis of SC-M1 cells via Notch2 pathway
To validate the effect of miR-23b on tumor
growth of gastric cancer cells, SC-M1 cells infected with
miR-23b-expressing adenoviruses were subcutaneously
injected into nude mice to assess the xenografted tumor
growth. The tumor sizes of SC-M1 cells were reduced by
miR-23b overexpression (Figure 7A, left). On day 27 postinjection, subcutaneous tumors were excised from the
sacrificed mice for the detection of miR-23b expression
by miRNA quantitative real-time PCR. Results of miRNA
quantitative real-time PCR showed that miR-23b levels
in the xenografted tumors of mice injected with miR23b-expressing SC-M1 cells were higher than those of
control cells (Figure 7A, right). Moreover, we checked
whether miR-23b-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in
SC-M1 cells depends on Notch2 pathway. Data showed
that the miR-23b-inhibited xenografted tumor growth
was restored in N2IC-expressing SC-M1/myc-N2IC-His
cells (Figure 7B, left). miR-23b levels in the xenografted
tumors of mice injected with miR-23b-expressing cells
were higher than those of control cells by quantitative realtime PCR (Figure 7B, right).
To evaluate the effect of miR-23b/Notch2 pathway
on metastatic colonization of gastric cancer cells, N2ICexpressing SC-M1/myc-N2IC-His cells or control cells
were infected with miR-23b-expressing adenoviruses
and then intravenously injected into lateral tail vein of
non-obese diabetic severe-combined immunodeficiency

DISCUSSION

exhibits a tumor-suppressive effect on gastric cancer
progression through targeting Notch2 receptor and
Ets1. Additionally, Notch2 pathway and miR-23b form
a reciprocal regulation loop in gastric carcinogenesis
(Figure 7D). The mutual regulation of Notch2 pathway
and miR-23b in this loop could more precisely tune
target gene expressions.

To decipher the molecular mechanism regarding
the regulation of gastric cancer progression, we had
identified the Notch2 receptor-related miRNA miR-23b
and further characterized its role in gastric carcinogenesis
herein. The critical epigenetic regulator miR-23b
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

miR-23b exhibits dichotomous roles in cancer
progression [32]. For example, miR-23b promotes
tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells [32, 33]. Conversely,
miR-23b inhibits carcinogenesis in prostate cancer cells
[34], colon cancer [35], and hepatocellular carcinoma [36]
and suppresses lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
[37]. We clearly demonstrated herein that miR-23b blocks
gastric cancer progression. Additionally, numerous reports
documented that miRNAs regulate the stemness of cancer
stem cells [18, 31, 38]. Notch2 pathway and miR-205
form a mutual regulation loop in modulating mammary
stem cell fate [18]. Results of this study also showed
that miR-23b dampened tumorsphere formation ability
(Figure 5) and affected pluripotency gene expressions and
tumorsphere ultra-structure (Figure 6) in gastric cancer
cells through Notch2 receptor. These results imply that the
Notch2/miR-23b reciprocal loop plays an essential role in
the maintenance of cancer stem-like phenotype in gastric
cancer cells.
The role of E2F1 in tumorigenesis is complicated
[19] and their expressions are higher in samples of
gastric cancer patients with stages I–II but lower in those
with stages III–IV [20]. Based on our data of stratified
analysis (Figure 1B), mRNA levels of E2F1 were also
down-regulated in gastric cancer samples of patients
with advanced stages. Furthermore, there are several
approaches regarding preclinical evaluation and clinical
trials of strategies for Notch pathway modulation [3]. To
develop miRNA-based therapy for cancer treatment, it is
foreseeable to suppress miRNAs acting as oncogenes or
restore those acting as tumor suppressors in the future [8].
Based on the results of Figure 1C, miR-23b has the
potential as the diagnostic marker and therapeutic target
of gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis. All E2F1
[19], Notch pathways [2, 3], and miRNAs [8, 9] exert the
context-dependent, dichotomous, and contradictory roles
in cancers. It is difficult to treat gastric malignancies only
via cutting-off one factor in Notch2/miR-23b loop. For the
treatment of gastric cancer, it is a potential application in
combination therapies targeting miR-23b, E2F1, Notch2
receptor, and Ets1 in the future.

miR-23b-27b-24-1 promoter [41] contain the DNA segments
of human Ets1 3′-UTR (nucleotide 1–3519 from the start of
3′-UTR) and human miR-23b-27b-24-1 cluster promoter,
respectively. Reporter plasmids Nanog-Luc, SOX-2-Luc,
and Oct4-Luc contain promoters of human pluripotency
genes Nanog, SOX-2, and Oct4, respectively [42].
For knockdown of the endogenous Ets1 and E2F1,
their target sequences were constructed in siRNA vector
pLKO.1 as described previously [5, 43]. To knock
down Notch2 receptor, the target sequences were also
constructed in siRNA vector pLKO.1 [4]. The siRNA
vector pLKO.1-shLuc against luciferase was used as
a negative control for knockdown validation [5, 43].
To construct miR-23b-expressing adenoviral plasmid,
its precursor sequence was amplified by PCR from the
genomic DNA of SC-M1 cells. Then the precursor DNA
fragment was cloned to generate a recombinant miR23b-expressing adenoviral plasmid containing a GFP
tracer as described [40].
To construct the miR-23b-expressing adenoviral
plasmid, the precursor sequence of miR-23b was amplified
by PCR from the genomic DNA of SC-M1 cells. The
amplified DNA fragment was subsequently cloned into
pAdTrack-CMV vector containing a GFP tracer to generate
pAdTrack-miR-23b plasmid [40]. After linearizing with
Pme I, pAdTrack-miR-23b plasmid was transformed into
BJ5183-AD-1 bacterial cells harboring the adenoviral
pAdEasy-1 vector (Stratagene) to construct a recombinant
miR-23b-expressing adenoviral plasmid. The used primers
for plasmid construction, siRNA, PCR, and real-time PCR
were listed in Supplementary Tables S1. All constructs
used in this study were verified by sequencing.

Cell culture and transfection
Human stomach carcinoma including SC-M1,
AGS, AZ521, NUGC-3, KATO III, SNU-16, and
NCI-N87 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
with 10% fetal bovine serum. The stable N2ICexpressing SC-M1/myc-N2IC-His cells, Notch2
receptor-knocked down SC-M1/Notch2i (#1 and #9)
cells, and their control cells (SC-M1/pcDNA3 and SCM1/Luci cells, respectively) were described previously
[4]. Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation
or transfection reagents such as Lipofectamine™
2000 (Invitrogen). SC-M1 cells (5 × 105) were seeded
onto 6-well plates and then transiently transfected for
luciferase reporter gene assay [40]. The transfected cells
were infected with adenoviruses expressing miRNAs or
GFP after 24 hours post-transfection. Luciferase activity
was measured and then normalized after 24 hours postinfection as described before [40]. Antagomir-23b and
scrambled control oligonucleotides (Ambion) were
transfected into SC-M1 cells at a final concentration of
50 or 100 nM [40].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids and plasmid construction
Expression construct pcDNA-myc-N2IC-His contains
the cDNA encoding amino acid residues 1700–2471 of
human Notch2 receptor [4]. Plasmid pCI-ETS1 contains
the cDNA encoding human Ets1 [39]. The DNA segment of
human Notch2 receptor 3′-UTR (nucleotide 2365–2932 from
the start of 3′-UTR) was amplified by PCR from the genomic
DNA of SC-M1 cells to construct reporter plasmid pNotch2
3′-UTR-Luc as described  previously [40]. Reporter
plasmids of pmiR-RB-Ets1 3′-UTR [21] and

the spheres larger than 50 μm in diameter were counted
under the microscope.

The recombinant adenoviral plasmid expressing
miR-23b was linearized by Pac I and then transfected
into AD-293 adenovirus packaging cells to obtain
packaged recombinant adenovirus expressing miR-23b
as described before [40]. The pAdTrack-CMV vector
was also used to generate GFP-expressing adenoviruses
as a control. Both titer and multiplicity of infection of
recombinant adenoviruses were detected according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene).

Migration and invasion assays
As described [5], migration and invasion abilities
of the treated cells were examined in 24-well plates by
Millicell tissue culture plate well inserts (Millipore) for
12 hours and BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers
(Becton Dickinson) for 20 hours, respectively. After
removing cells on the upper surface of the membrane
with a cotton swab, the migrated or invaded cells on the
lower surface of membrane were fixed with methanol and
stained with 0.005% crystal violet in PBS for 1 hour. Then
numbers of the migrated or invaded cells were counted
from 10 random fields under the microscope.

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA isolated by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
was used to synthesize cDNA for the detection of mRNAs
and then the cDNAs were amplified [31]. All primers used
in real-time PCR analysis are listed in the Supplementary
Tables S1. The relative quantification of mRNA levels
was normalized with those of GAPDH and then corrected
to a calibrator using the StepOne software 2.1 (Applied
Biosystems). The cDNA synthesis and TaqMan miRNA
real-time PCR assays were performed for the detection
of mature miRNAs [40]. The relative quantification of
miRNA levels was normalized to those of RNU48 small
nucleolar RNA and corrected to a calibrator using the
StepOne software 2.1.

Scanning electron microscopic analysis
After washing by PBS twice, the tumorspheres
collected by sedimentation were fixed with 2%
glutaraldehyde for 2 hours, followed by 1% osmium
tetraoxide for 2 hours for ultra-structural analysis [31].
After washing with deionized water, samples were frozen
at −80°C for 8 hours and then dehydrated overnight
using Freeze-Drying machine (VirTis Freezemobile
25ES). Subsequently, the lyophilized samples were
subjected to sputter coating with gold nano particles for
120 seconds before the examination with a scanning
electron microscope (JSM-7600F; JEOL Ltd., Japan) at
an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.

Western blot analysis
As described previously [44], whole-cell extracts
were prepared for Western blotting using anti-Notch2
C-terminal, anti-E2F1, anti-c-Myc, anti-E-cadherin,
anti-Ets1, anti-plakoglobin (Santa Cruz), anti-vimentin
(Sigma), anti-N-cadherin (BD Biosciences), anti-CD44,
anti-Nanog, anti-Oct4, anti-SOX2, anti-Twist, and antiGAPDH (GeneTex) antibodies.

Xenografted tumorigenicity assay in nude mice
All animal experiments performed in this study were
carried out in accordance with a protocol approved by the
institutional ethical committee (Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of National Yang-Ming University).
Five-week-old BALB/c nu/nu mice purchased from the
National Science Council Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan)
were subcutaneously injected at both hind limbs with
3 × 106 viable cells in a total volume of 0.1 ml of PBS.
Volume of xenografts was estimated after measurement
with calipers every 3 days [40]. The injected mice were
sacrificed on day 27, and miR-23b levels in excised tumor
samples were detected by miRNA quantitative real-time
PCR subsequently.

Cell growth and viability assays
To evaluate cell growth, the treated cells (1 × 104)
were seeded and then counted by trypan blue exclusion
method at the time indicated. Cell viability was assessed
by MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) assay after incubation for 24 or
48 hours as described [4].

Colony and tumorsphere formation assays
For the colony formation assay, the treated cells were
seeded for the assay of anchorage-independent growth in
soft agar [45]. Two weeks later, the colonies larger than
0.1 mm in diameter were counted from 10 random fields
under the microscope. For the tumorsphere formation
assay, a total of 300 treated cells were suspended in
stem cell-selective conditions and then seeded onto
96-well ultra-low attachment plates [40]. Nine days later,

In vivo tail vein metastasis assay
In brief, six-week-old male NOD-SCID mice
(National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan) were injected
with 1 × 106 viable cells by tail vein injection [40]. After
15 weeks, the injected mice were sacrificed, and the
metastatic nodules in lungs of mice were counted by gross
and microscopic examination.
