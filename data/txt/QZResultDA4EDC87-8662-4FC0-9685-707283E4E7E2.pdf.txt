BACKGROUND: Concurrent inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is
an active and well tolerated regimen in recurrent head and neck cancer (HNC). In the current phase 1 trial, the
authors sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and efficacy of concurrent erlotinib and celecoxib
as a radiosensitizing regimen. METHODS: Fourteen patients with previously irradiated HNC with no distant metastases who required reirradiation were eligible. Treatment consisted of daily erlotinib 150 mg and twice daily celecoxib
(escalated from 200 mg to 600 mg using a 3 þ 3 design with an expanded cohort at the MTD) starting on Day 1 and
was continued during radiation. Daily radiation was started on Day 15, and maintenance erlotinib was recommended.
RESULTS: The recommended phase 2 dose of celecoxib was 400 mg. Three dose-limiting toxicities included late infield orocutaneous fistula (Dose Level 2), osteonecrosis (Dose Level 3), and trismus (Dose Level 3). Acute grade 3
toxicities were uncommon and included mucositis (21%) and dermatitis (14%). At a median follow-up of 11 months,
the 1-year locoregional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates were 60%, 37%, and 55%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent erlotinib, celecoxib, and reirradiation was a feasible and clinically active regimen in

Patients who develop recurrent or second primary tumors in the previously irradiated head and neck represent a
major treatment dilemma.1 Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice but often is not possible or is incomplete.2 In a randomized trial reported by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC),
approximately 80% of patients suffered a locoregional relapse at 24 months after salvage surgery alone compared with
40% of patients who underwent salvage surgery followed by concurrent chemotherapy and reirradiation.3 Systemic therapy alone, consisting of chemotherapy and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, results in a median
survival of 6 to 10 months with virtually no long-term survivors.1,4 A final option is reirradiation, often with concurrent
chemotherapy, to address the unacceptably high rate of locoregional progression.3 With this approach, approximately
20% to 30% of patients remain alive and free of recurrence, and the rates of locoregional control exceed 50% after maximal debulking surgery.3,5,6 In a large series from the University of Chicago that investigated concurrent chemotherapy
and reirradiation, 17% of patients died from events possibly related to treatment, including 5% who had carotid hemorrhage.5 Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate novel and less toxic approaches to salvage treatment.
Biologically targeted agents have emerged as important treatment options in advanced head and neck cancer.7
Approximately 80% to 90% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) demonstrate elevated EGFR, and
approximately 10% of patients respond to anti-EGFR monotherapy.8,9 It is noteworthy that, relative to chemotherapy,
these agents have a favorable toxicity profile with no significant enhancement of radiation-induced mucosal toxicity.10

Original Article

Although the monoclonal antibody cetuximab is the best
studied agent, small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated similar activity rates
in the recurrent and metastatic settings.11,12 In addition
to the advantages of convenient oral administration, antiEGFR TKIs can circumvent certain mechanisms of
ligand-independent EGFR mutations.13 Like EGFR, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is another overexpressed marker
in HNSCC that correlates with a poor prognosis. Indeed,
previous studies have characterized downstream crosstalk
between the 2 molecules, and the preclinical use of EGFR
TKIs combined with COX-2 inhibitors have demonstrated additive efficacy in inhibiting the growth of
HNSCC cell lines. With the objective of enhancing
response to EGFR inhibitors, a recent phase 1 trial from
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute demonstrated a 22%
response rate to concurrent gefitinib and celecoxib with
minimal toxicity.14 On the basis of these data, along with
supporting preclinical data from our laboratory and
others, we designed a phase 1 trial to assess the feasibility
and tolerability of combined erlotinib, celecoxib, and
reirradiation.7,15

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Pretreatment Evaluations
This phase 1 trial (MSSM 06-0509; National Clinical
Trials identifier NCT00970502) was approved by the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine institutional review
board, and all patients signed informed consent. The primary endpoints were to describe the dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT) of the regimen and to define a recommended
phase 2 dose of erlotinib, celecoxib, and reirradiation.
The time to progression was a secondary endpoint. Pretreatment evaluations included medical history, physical
examination, routine laboratory studies (complete metabolic profile, complete blood count with differential, and
international normalized ratio [INR]). Imaging studies
included a computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck
and either chest CT or whole-body fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies.
Eligibility
Eligible patients had a biopsy-proven, malignant neoplasm located in the head and neck with no evidence of
distant metastases. Measurable disease was not required.
The patients had received previous radiation to the head
and neck. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2

with adequate bone marrow function (white blood cell
count 1500/lL, platelets 100,000/lL), kidney function (creatinine <1.5 g/dL), liver function (bilirubin
1.5 mg/dL, transaminase concentrations >2.5 times the
upper limit of normal, and INR 1.5 times the upper
limit of normal), and lung function (oxygen saturation
>95% on room air). Patients who had allergies to aspirin,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or COX-2 inhibitors; patients who had gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers;
pregnant patients; and patients who required blood thinners during treatment were ineligible. All patients were
evaluated by head and neck surgery, medical oncology,
and radiation oncology before trial entry. Because eligible
patients also could receive reirradiation and concurrent
chemotherapy off protocol, trial enrollment generally was
reserved for 3 groups: 1) patients who failed previous chemoradiation; 2) patients who were not candidates for
chemotherapy because of age, comorbidity, or patient refusal; and 3) patients who presented with conditions for
which there was unproven benefit for chemotherapy (ie,
salivary gland or facial skin primary). Patients were enrolled at least 6 months after they had completed prior
radiation.
Erlotinib and Celecoxib Dose-Escalation
Strategy
Erlotinib 150 mg either orally or by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) once daily and celecoxib 200 to
600 mg orally or by PEG twice daily were started 14 days
before radiation and were continued until the end of radiation. Celecoxib was escalated from 200 mg twice daily
(Dose Level 1) to 400 mg twice daily (Dose Level 2) and
to 600 mg twice daily (Dose Level 3) using a standard 3 þ
3 design. DLT was defined as any unexpected grade 3 toxicity and all grade 4 and 5 toxicities using the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0
(http://ctep.cancer.gov; accessed July 1, 2010). Expected
acute toxicities included grade 3 and 4 mucositis and
grade 3 esophagitis, in-field dermatitis, fatigue, diarrhea,
metabolic abnormalities, and hematologic toxicity.
Although late grade 3 and 4 toxicities were considered
dose limiting, and we believed these probably were related
to cumulative radiation doses >100 grays (Gy) rather
than to experimental drug therapy. Discontinuation of
treatment because of patient refusal or declining performance status was not considered a DLT. If no patients had a
DLT, then the dose was escalated to the next level. If 1
patient developed a DLT, then an additional 3 patients
were treated at the same dose level. If 2 patients

developed a DLT at any level, then dose escalation was
terminated, the next lowest dose level was declared the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and safety was confirmed with an expanded cohort at that level.
Dose Modifications
In the event of grade 3 toxicity related to erlotinib, the
drug temporarily was discontinued and was resumed at
100 mg when toxicity resolved to grade 2. A second
dose reduction to 50 mg was allowed in the event of persistent toxicity. In the event of grade 3 toxicity related to
celecoxib, the drug temporarily was discontinued and was
resumed at the next lower dose level when toxicity
resolved to grade 2. Any drug-related hospitalization or
erlotinib-related interstitial lung disease required immediate discontinuation. Maintenance erlotinib at 150 mg
daily was recommended until patients developed either
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Radiotherapy Guidelines
All available previous radiation records were reviewed.
Radiation was delivered by intensity-modulated radiation
therapy planning for all patients starting on Day 15 of
erlotinib and celecoxib. All patients underwent CT simulation using an Aquaplast mask (WFR/Aquaplast Corp.,
Avondale, Pa) and custom shoulder immobilization.
Patients underwent CT simulation, usually with fusion of
PET or MRI imaging to assist with target delineation. In
postoperative patients, surgical clips and pretreatment
imaging were used to recreate the tumor bed. Every effort
was used to minimize the radiation dose to the previously
irradiated spinal cord and brainstem with lifetime acceptable doses of 54 Gy and 60 Gy, respectively. The gross tumor volume received 70.4 Gy, and microscopic positive
margins or extracapsular extension received 63 Gy in 2.2Gy fractions daily fractions on Monday through Friday. A
simultaneous integrated boost plan was used to treat highrisk microscopic disease, which consisted of the resected
tumor bed and/or first echelon of uninvolved lymph node
stations to 60 Gy. At the discretion of the treating radia-

tion oncologist, the low-risk microscopic neck was treated
with up to 54 Gy.
Follow-Up and Toxicity Criteria
Patients were assessed weekly during radiation, 4 weeks after radiation, and every 3 months thereafter. Patient history, physical examination, and laboratory tests were done
during each visit. CT studies of the neck were obtained
performed at 4 weeks after radiation and every 3 to 4
months thereafter. A PET scan was performed at 3
months after radiation and was repeated every 4 to 6
months.16
Response, Disease Control, and Survival
For patients with measurable disease, response was scored
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors.17 All patients were followed until either disease
recurrence or death, and no patients were lost to followup. Survival and disease control parameters were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with survival and
time to progression defined as first day of treatment until
either an event or the last follow-up. Patients who died
without evidence of disease recurrence were censored at
the time of death for time-to-progression curves.
Immunohistochemistry
Pretreatment tumor samples were available from 11
patients, were embedded in paraffin, and were stained
with mouse monoclonal human anti-COX2 and antiEGFR antibodies (Dako Belgium N.V., Heverlee, Belgium). Briefly, tissues were fixed on glass slides with 10%
formalin, deparaffinized in a xylene bath, and dehydrated
with ethyl alcohol. Before immunostaining, slides were
bathed in a 95 C water bath and were allowed to cool in
buffer for 20 minutes. The slides were blocked in swine
serum, and primary antibody was applied at a 1:100
dilution for 1 hour at room temperature. Samples
were then stained with secondary, peroxidase-labeled
horse antimouse antibody at a 1:100 dilution for 1 hour
at room temperature followed by application of

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
In total, 14 eligible patients were enrolled on this study
between March 2007 and December 2009 (Table 1). An
additional patient provided informed consent but withdrew before receiving study treatment and was excluded
from further analysis. Patient and tumor characteristics
are listed in Table 2. Briefly, 43% of patients were aged
70, years 64% had an ECOG performance status of 2,
79% were known smokers, 21% had oropharyngeal primaries, 71% had T4a/T4b disease, and 79% had positive
lymph nodes. Only 1 patient continued to smoke during
treatment. Prior treatment before radiation is listed in Table 2. It is noteworthy that, on review of prior treatment
records, 71% of patients had received previous suboptimal radiation, which was defined as inadequate volume,
insufficient dose, or treatment protraction; 50% had
received previous chemotherapy; and 71% had failed
prior surgery.

Treatment Compliance
The median follow-up for all patients was 11 months
(range, 3-20 months), and the median follow-up for surviving patients was 16 months (range, 8-20 months).
Twelve of 14 patients were able to complete their prescribed dose of radiation with no or minimal treatment
delay. One patient at Dose Level 1 had no response to
treatment and was switched to an alternative regimen,
which consisted of 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and accelerated radiation. A second patient at Dose Level 2 discontinued reirradiation at a dose of 24.2 Gy because of

comfort and anxiety that was refractory to medications.
Overall, 94% of the prescribed radiation dose was delivered. However, mainly because of patient refusal, only 3
of 14 patients received maintenance erlotinib.
Acute and Late Toxicity
Overall treatment was well tolerated, particularly at Dose
Levels 1 and 2 (Tables 1 and 3). One patient at Dose Level
2 developed a grade 3 pharyngocutaneous fistula and
required flap reconstruction. One patient at Dose Level 3
had a dose reduction of celecoxib because of symptomatic
grade 2 folliculitis, nausea, and rectal bleeding. These toxicities resolved at a celecoxib dose of 400 mg twice daily.
This patient developed late grade 3 bone necrosis and
required reconstructive surgery. A second patient at Dose
Level 3 developed late grade 3 trismus and also required
reconstructive surgery. Because of these 2 late grade 3 toxicities at Dose Level 3, Dose Level 2 was established as the
MTD (Table 1). All 3 late grade 3 toxicities occurred
within the prior radiation field. The most common acute
grade 3 toxicities were mucositis (21% of patients), pain
(21% of patients), fatigue (21% of patients), dermatitis
(7% of patients), and hyponatremia (7% of patients).
Clinical Responses
All patients were assessable for survival and time to progression. Among the 7 patients who had measurable disease before treatment, 5 patients had a complete response,
and a sixth patient had only foci of residual squamous cell
carcinoma (Table 4). At last follow-up, 4 patients were
alive and free of disease, 4 patients had isolated

locoregional progression, 2 patients had isolated distant
progression, 1 patient had both locoregional and distant
progression, and 3 patients had no evidence of disease but
died of comorbid illness. The 1-year locoregional control,
distant control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates were 60%, 56%, 37%, and 55%, respectively
(Fig. 1). An example of a complete clinical, metabolic,
and pathologic response is provided in Figure 2.
Biologic Correlatives
Baseline EGFR and COX-2 levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry (Table 4), but no correlation with
response was observed. Imaging studies from a patient
who had a complete response with elevated pretreatment
EGFR and COX-2 levels are provided in Figure 2.

DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates the feasibility and low
acute toxicity of combined erlotinib, celecoxib, and reirradiation. Although the late toxicities probably were related
to surgery and/or lifetime radiation doses of 120 to 136
Gy rather than to erlotinib and celecoxib, we noted 2
DLTs at a celecoxib dose of 600 mg twice daily and 1
DLT at a celecoxib dose of 400 mg twice daily. Therefore,
the recommended phase 2 doses are erlotinib 150 mg
daily and celecoxib 400 mg twice daily starting on Day 1
and continuing during radiation at 2.2 Gy daily starting
on Day 15. Celecoxib 400 mg twice daily is the US Food
and Drug Administration-approved dose for preventing
precancerous polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyps.18 It is noteworthy that there was significant
evidence of several durable complete responses with this
regimen, providing clinical evidence of radiosensitization
by erlotinib and celecoxib in patients with recurrent and
previously irradiated head and neck cancer. This
approach, as an active regimen that can be administered
to elderly and heavily pretreated patients with a favorable
acute toxicity profile, warrants further exploration both in
the reirradiation and previously untreated settings. This
regimen also may be appropriate for further study in
patients with locally advanced salivary gland or cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma who currently have a poor prognosis with radiation alone.19
Although it once was controversial, there is now a
growing body of evidence supporting the role of reirradiation in selected patients who have advanced tumors that
occur after prior head and neck radiation.5,6,20,21 Perhaps
the most compelling evidence is the EORTC trial, which

surgery and adjuvant chemoreirradiation was approximately 60%.5 In comparison, in unresectable patients, the
3-year locoregional control rate was approximately 35%.5
Although reirradiation is performed with curative intent,
its primary disadvantages are the possibility of treatmentrelated morbidity and mortality, which are especially
common reirradiation is received in combination with
aggressive chemotherapy regimens.1
Two earlier studies combined reirradiation with
EGFR inhibitors. A phase 1 trial of 14 patients from
University of Colorado demonstrated the feasibility of
concurrent erlotinib and reirradiation followed by maintenance erlotinib.22 Similar to our study, there were no
unexpected acute toxicities, but there were 2 serious late
toxicities, which consisted of grade 5 carotid hemorrhage
and osteonecrosis. The 1-year progression-free survival
rate in that study was 38%. A second study from Goethe
University demonstrated a reasonable toxicity profile in 7
patients who received concurrent cetuximab and reirradiation to 50.4 Gy.23 Taken together, these data strongly
suggest that reirradiation with concurrent EGFR inhibitors is an active salvage regimen with a toxicity profile
similar to that of reirradiation alone. Although combined
treatment with EGFR and angiogenesis inhibitors has
been tested in patients with recurrent/metastatic
HNSCC, to our knowledge, this approach has not been
applied previously to the reirradiation population.14 In
the current study, we demonstrated the feasibility of combining a combination of biologically targeted agents with
radiation. The mechanism of action of celecoxib is quite
complex but may include effects on angiogenesis.7
Although EGFR inhibitors clearly represent a treatment advance in HNSCC, the disconnect between high
rates of EGFR overexpression and low single-agent activity rates remains incompletely understood.8 Consistent
with prior work, we identified no definite association
between EGFR levels on immunohistochemistry and
response to erlotinib, celecoxib, and reirradiation.24
Taken together, these results suggest that the majority of
tumors have alternative mechanisms of survival despite
treatment with EGFR inhibitors.25 There is significant
crosstalk between COX-2 and EGFR signaling pathways,
and preclinical studies in models of HNSCC suggest that
combined inhibition of both pathways is more effective at
inhibiting growth and angiogenesis than either agent
alone.7 Although only 3 of our 14 patients developed distant metastases, the 1-year distant control rate was only
56%. Further preclinical studies to determine whether
maintenance EGFR and COX-2 inhibition would be

3180

more effective at preventing distant metastasis are
planned.25 In conclusion, concurrent erlotinib, COX-2,
and reirradiation is a well tolerated and active regimen for
patients with recurrent head and neck cancer.
