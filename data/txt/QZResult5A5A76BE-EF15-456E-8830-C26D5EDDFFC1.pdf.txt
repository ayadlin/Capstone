Abstract
Acquired point mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain represent a common mechanism of resistance to
ABL inhibitor therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The BCR-ABLT315I mutant is highly
resistant to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, and is frequently detected in relapsed patients. This critical gap in
resistance coverage drove development of DCC-2036, an ABL inhibitor that binds the switch control pocket
involved in conformational regulation of the kinase domain. We evaluated the efficacy of DCC-2036 against BCRABLT315I and other mutants in cellular and biochemical assays and conducted cell-based mutagenesis screens.
DCC-2036 inhibited autophosphorylation of ABL and ABLT315I enzymes, and this activity was consistent with
selective efficacy against Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL (IC50: 19 nmol/L), BCR-ABLT315I (IC50: 63 nmol/L), and
most kinase domain mutants. Ex vivo exposure of CML cells from patients harboring BCR-ABL or BCR-ABLT315I to
DCC-2036 revealed marked inhibition of colony formation and reduced phosphorylation of the direct BCR-ABL
target CrkL. Cell-based mutagenesis screens identified a resistance profile for DCC-2036 centered around select Ploop mutations (G250E, Q252H, Y253H, E255K/V), although a concentration of 750 nmol/L DCC-2036 suppressed
the emergence of all resistant clones. A decreased concentration of DCC-2036 (160 nmol/L) in dual combination
with either nilotinib or dasatinib achieved the same zero outgrowth result. Further screens for resistance due to
BCR-ABL compound mutations (two mutations in the same clone) identified BCR-ABLE255V / T315I as the most
resistant mutant. Taken together, these findings support continued evaluation of DCC-2036 as an important new
agent for treatment-refractory CML. Cancer Res; 71(9); 3189–95. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Use of ABL inhibitors to block the activity of the oncogenic
BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in the treatment of chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) serves as a model for molecularly targeted
cancer therapies. The ABL inhibitor imatinib has an extensive
and impressive clinical track record in CML, with newly
diagnosed, chronic phase patients demonstrating 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates of 89% and 93%, respec-

tively (1). Most patients treated with imatinib experience
durable responses, although discontinuation of therapy due
to intolerance or resistance is necessary in a subset of patients,
particularly in advanced disease (2).
Resistance to imatinib is most commonly explained by
acquired point mutations in the kinase domain of BCRABL, which impair drug binding (3). Mutations at over 50
residues conferring varying degrees of imatinib resistance
have been reported clinically (4). The more potent ABL
inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib have proven largely successful in imatinib-refractory CML patients harboring this type of
resistance, with the key exception of the BCR-ABLT315I
mutant. Consequently, the addition of targeted ABL inhibitors
with activity against BCR-ABLT315I will be critical to further
controlling drug resistance in CML (3).
A recent approach to addressing this gap in resistance
coverage utilized DCC-2036, an inhibitor that avoids direct
binding contact at T315 and binds a transiently formed
switch control pocket of ABL, resulting in stabilization of
an electrostatic ion pair (R386 of the activation loop and
E282 of the C-helix) critical for maintaining the catalytically
inactive kinase conformation. DCC-2036 exhibits a long

off-rate for binding both ABL and ABLT315I, and demonstrates additional highly selective activity for FLT3, TIE2,
and SRC-family kinases. DCC-2036 also showed significant
efficacy and improved survival in a murine bone marrow
transplantation model of BCR-ABLT315I-driven CML (5).
Here, we evaluate the efficacy of DCC-2036 against BCRABLT315I and other mutants in CML cell lines and primary
cells, and establish the anticipated resistance profile for
DCC-2036 using cell-based screens.

Hematopoietic colony formation assays
To assess granulocyte/macrophage colony formation (CFUGM), mononuclear cells from bone marrow of a newly diagnosed CML patient, an accelerated phase patient harboring
BCR-ABLT315I, or a healthy donor were obtained following
informed consent and plated alone or with DCC-2036 (50 or
500 nmol/L) or imatinib (2,000 nmol/L) in triplicate (5  104
cells/plate) in IMDM/methylcellulose as described (9). Results
are reported as percentage of colonies relative to untreated.

Materials and Methods

Cell-based resistance screens
For DCC-2036 screens starting from Ba/F3 cells expressing
native BCR-ABL, cells were treated overnight with N-ethyl-Nnitrosourea (ENU; 50 mg/mL) and resuspended in complete
media (1  105 cells/well) supplemented with DCC-2036 (50–
1,250 nmol/L) as described (10). DCC-2036 (160 nmol/L) was
also evaluated in dual combinations with imatinib (2,000
nmol/L), nilotinib (500 nmol/L), or dasatinib (25 nmol/L).
Wells exhibiting outgrowth were expanded, sequenced, and
analyzed for mutations (Mutation Surveyor; SoftGenetics) as
described (8). Similar experiments were conducted starting
from Ba/F3 BCR-ABLT315I cells treated with DCC-2036 (250–
750 nmol/L), and from a pooled mix of equal cell numbers of
all Ba/F3 BCR-ABL cell lines treated with a cocktail of ABL
kinase inhibitors [DCC-2036 (250 nmol/L), nilotinib (500
nmol/L), and dasatinib (25 nmol/L)].

ABL autophosphorylation assays
Kinase autophosphorylation assays with tyrosine-dephosphorylated ABL and ABLT315I (Invitrogen) were performed
alone or with DCC-2036 (0.2–3,125 nmol/L) or imatinib (625–
3,125 nmol/L) as described (6).
Cell lines
Certified Ba/F3, K562, KYO1, LAMA, HEL, CMK, and Marimo cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and grown in the recommended culture medium.
Ba/F3 transfectants expressing native BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL
with a single kinase domain mutation were generated and
maintained as described (7). The Ba/F3 BCR-ABLT315A cell line
was a gift from N. Shah (UCSF). None of the cell lines used in
this study was cultured for longer than 6 months from initial
purchase or characterization. No further authentication of cell
line characteristics was done.
Cell proliferation assays
Parental Ba/F3 cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing native or
mutant BCR-ABL (4  103 per well) were incubated alone or
with DCC-2036 (0.2–15,625 nmol/L) for 72 hours. Proliferation
measurements and IC50 value determinations were done as
described (7). Identical experiments were carried out for CML
(K562, KYO1, LAMA) and non-CML cell lines (HEL, CMK,
Marimo).
Immunoblot analyses of CrkL phosphorylation
For cell line experiments, Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL,
BCR-ABLE255V, or BCR-ABLT315I (5  106 cells/well) were
cultured 4 hours in complete media alone or with DCC2036 (0.2–3,125 nmol/L) or imatinib (0.2–3,125 nmol/L) as
described (8). For primary cell experiments, following
informed consent, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
a newly diagnosed CML patient and from an accelerated phase
patient harboring BCR-ABLT315I were cultured (2  106 per
well) overnight in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing 20% bovine serum albumin, insulin, transferrin (BIT) serum substitute (Stemcell) alone or with DCC2036 (0.2–625 nmol/L), imatinib (1,000 nmol/L), nilotinib (200
nmol/L), or dasatinib (50 nmol/L). For all experiments, cells
were lysed in boiling SDS-PAGE loading buffer supplemented
with 0.1 mmol/L AEBSF and 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, subjected to
SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies against phosphorylated (anti-Y207; Cell Signaling) or total CrkL (C-20;
Santa Cruz).

Results and Discussion
We established that DCC-2036 (Fig. 1A) directly inhibits the
catalytic activity of ABL and ABLT315I by evaluating kinase
autophosphorylation activity. Although both imatinib and
DCC-2036 attenuated activity of ABL, only DCC-2036 blocked
ABLT315I tyrosine autophosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Unlike imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, the binding mode of DCC-2036
to ABL or ABLT315I does not require a hydrogen bond to the
side chain hydroxyl of native T315 and avoids a steric clash
with mutated I315. On binding, DCC-2036 induces and stabilizes an aspartate-phenylalanine-glycine motif (DFG)-out, catalytically inactive conformation of the kinase domain,
precluding phosphorylation of activation loop residue Y393,
a critical event preceding full catalytic activation of ABL
kinase (5).
Cellular assays demonstrated that DCC-2036 selectively
inhibits most clinically relevant imatinib-resistant mutants
(Fig. 1C). DCC-2036 inhibited growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing
BCR-ABL (IC50: 19 nmol/L) with approximately 16-fold higher
potency than imatinib and, of key importance, cells expressing
the imatinib-, nilotinib-, and dasatinib-resistant BCR-ABLT315I
mutant (IC50: 63 nmol/L). The selectivity of DCC-2036 for BCRABL–positive cells was evidenced by its marked inhibition of
CML cell lines compared with non-CML leukemia lines
(Fig. 1C). Sensitivity of BCR-ABL mutants to DCC-2036 segregated into 3 categories: (a) IC50  50 nmol/L: 1/14; M351T,
(b) IC50  100 nmol/L: 8/14; M244V, G250E, Q252H, Y253F,
T315A, T315I, F317L, H396P, and (c) IC50 > 100 nmol/L: 5/14;
Y253H, E255K, E255V, F317V, F359V. Among these, BCRABLE255V was least sensitive to DCC-2036 (IC50: 410 nmol/L).

autophosphorylation of full-length ABL or ABLT315I kinase treated with DCC-2036 or imatinib. Tyrosine-dephosphorylated enzyme exposed to inhibitor and
[g-32P]-ATP was separated by SDS-PAGE, and signal intensity was measured by autoradiography. C, cellular proliferation IC50 values for DCC-2036 in BCRABL–positive and –negative cell lines. For Ba/F3 cells expressing native or kinase domain-mutant BCR-ABL, fold IC50 increase over native BCR-ABL is given.
IC50 values for additional CML cell lines derived from CML blast crisis patients and non-CML cell lines are indicated. IC50 values are an average of 3
experiments; error bars represent SEM. D, immunoblot analysis of phosphorylation of CrkL (p-CrkL) in Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL, BCR-ABLE255V,
or BCR-ABLT315I following exposure to DCC-2036 or imatinib using an anti-Y207 CrkL antibody.

Immunoblot analyses examining the ability of DCC-2036
to block tyrosine phosphorylation of the direct BCR-ABL
substrate CrkL revealed greater inhibition in cells expressing
BCR-ABL or BCR-ABLT315I than BCR-ABLE255V (Fig. 1D). These
findings suggest that, although DCC-2036 exhibits activity
against the T315I mutant, select mutations of the P-loop such
as E255V may be more problematic. Notably, BCR-ABLE255V is
highly resistant to imatinib and confers moderate resistance to
both nilotinib and dasatinib in vitro (7), and has been reported
in clinical failures of each of these therapies (4, 11, 12).
As follow-up to the efficacy of DCC-2036 observed in BCRABL–positive cells, particularly the BCR-ABLT315I mutant, we
evaluated DCC-2036 against mononuclear cells from a newly
diagnosed CML chronic phase patient and an accelerated
phase patient harboring BCR-ABLT315I. Ex vivo exposure of
primary BCR-ABLT315I cells to DCC-2036 sharply reduced CrkL
phosphorylation, whereas imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib
were ineffective (Fig. 2A). All inhibitors reduced CrkL phosphorylation in primary cells from the newly diagnosed CML

patient (Fig. 2B), although imatinib (1 mmol/L) showed limited
effect. CrkL phosphorylation is a clinical biomarker of BCRABL activity, and its inhibition in primary CML cells has been
correlated with degree of response achieved on therapy (13).
Although complete pharmacodynamic data for DCC-2036
have not yet been reported, our results demonstrate that
DCC-2036 is active in clinical isolates from CML patients
harboring BCR-ABL or BCR-ABLT315I. This is corroborated
by colony formation data for primary CML cells, wherein
exposure of cells from the same BCR-ABLT315I CML patient
(Fig. 2A) and newly diagnosed CML patient (Fig. 2B) to DCC2036 substantially reduced outgrowth of CML cells, with no
toxicity toward mononuclear cells from a healthy individual
(Fig. 2C).
Given the unique binding characteristics of DCC-2036, we
screened for resistance-conferring mutations specific to DCC2036 but susceptible to other ABL inhibitors. Results from a
cell-based resistance screen for BCR-ABL mutants persisting in
the presence of DCC-2036 revealed a concentration-dependent

reduction in outgrowth and the spectrum of resistant subclones recovered (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Table S1). The resistance profile of DCC-2036 narrowed to a subset of mutations
described for imatinib (G250E, Q252H, Y253H, E255V, E255K,
F359I; refs. 4, 10), as has been largely the case for other ABL
inhibitors [dasatinib (10), nilotinib (10), SGX393 (9), AP24534
(8)], suggesting a limited set of resistance-conferring mutations
can be tolerated without crippling kinase function. Structurally, the vulnerability of DCC-2036 to P-loop mutations (e.g.,
E255V) suggests subtle local alterations in the ATP binding site
may effectively destabilize the inactive conformation, as for
imatinib (3). A full explanation pertaining to DCC-2036 will
require further crystallographic, dynamic (e.g., NMR), and in
silico analysis (5).
Impressively, resistant outgrowth was completely suppressed by DCC-2036 at 750 nmol/L (Fig. 3A; Supplementary
Table S1). As clinically achievable plasma levels of DCC-2036
have not yet been reported and select P-loop mutants confer
partial resistance to DCC-2036, nilotinib (7), and dasatinib (7),
we evaluated dual combinations of DCC-2036 (160 nmol/L)
with each clinical ABL inhibitor in resistance screens.
Although the combination of DCC-2036 with imatinib (2
mmol/L) reduced the fraction of wells with outgrowth, P-loop
vulnerabilities at residues G250, Y253, and E255 were detected
(Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S2). No resistant subclones

3192

Cancer Res; 71(9) May 1, 2011

were recovered with dual combinations of DCC-2036 and
clinically achievable concentrations of nilotinib (500 nmol/
L) or dasatinib (25 nmol/L). These findings are similar to those
from studies with another ABLT315I inhibitor, SGX393 (9), and
suggest that ABL inhibitor cocktails that include an ABLT315I
inhibitor such as DCC-2036 may represent a rational therapeutic approach to mitigating resistance.
As the immediate clinical application of an ABLT315I inhibitor is in refractory CML patients harboring this mutation, we
performed resistance screens starting from Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABLT315I to identify BCR-ABL compound mutations
(2 mutations in the same clone) conferring increased resistance to DCC-2036. Such mutations have been reported in
clinical failures to dasatinib or nilotinib salvage therapy,
suggesting potential for selection on sequential treatment
with ABL inhibitors (14–17). The compound mutation-based
resistance profile for DCC-2036 narrowed predominantly to
BCR-ABLE255V / T315I (83.3% of recovered mutants at 750 nmol/
L; Fig. 3C; Supplementary Table S3). An additional mutant
featuring substitution of the baseline isoleucine at residue 315
for methionine (I315M) was also recovered. To our knowledge,
mutation of the gatekeeper residue (either the native threonine or mutant isoleucine) to methionine has not been
observed in resistance to other ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

site residue M318 and the K271-E286 salt bridge, allowing for
accommodation of the bulky isoleucine substitution in BCRABLT315I. Electrostatic interaction with E282 aids in stabilizing
the E282-R386 switch control pair interaction and, consequently, the inactive kinase conformation (5). One explanation
for the resistance of the mutant featuring methionine at
residue 315 may be that the methionine sidechain impinges
on DCC-2036 binding. Alternatively, introducing methionine
at the gatekeeper position may induce the ABL kinase domain
to adopt an active conformation.
To both broaden the screen for BCR-ABL compound
mutant-mediated resistance and evaluate efficacy of ABL
inhibitor cocktails in this setting, we carried out a similar
screen starting from a pooled mix of Ba/F3 BCR-ABL mutant
cell lines (representing >70% of clinically observed imatinibresistant mutations; ref. 4) using a combination of DCC-2036
(250 nmol/L), nilotinib (500 nmol/L), and dasatinib (25 nmol/L;
Supplementary Fig. 1A). Strikingly, only 3 compound mutations were recovered: G250E/T315I, E255V/T315A, and E255V/
T315I. Among these, the BCR-ABLE255V / T315I mutant has been
observed clinically and reported to confer high level resistance
to multiple other ABLT315I inhibitors (Supplementary Table S4;
refs. 8, 15). Thus, although ABL inhibitor cocktails that include
an ABLT315I inhibitor may prove an effective strategy in minimizing resistance, certain BCR-ABL compound mutations are
predicted to be recalcitrant to such an approach.
Our investigation of the switch control inhibitor DCC2036 reveals substantial activity in CML cells, including
cells expressing BCR-ABLT315I. DCC-2036 is undergoing
phase 1 evaluation for use in imatinib-refractory CML
(NCT00827138; www.clinicaltrials.gov), and our results sug-

gest that it may provide a treatment option for relapsed
patients with a T315I mutation. DCC-2036 adds to a small
set of ABLT315I inhibitors currently in development, each of
which targets the BCR-ABLT315I mutant differently. Recent
approaches include: dodging I315 via a carbon–carbon triple
bond (ponatinib, formerly AP24534; ref. 8; pivotal phase 2
trial; NCT01207440; www.clinicaltrials.gov), utilizing a modified nilotinib–dasatinib hybrid structure to avoid gatekeeper mutations (HG-7–85-01; ref. 18; preclinical), and
combining ATP-competitive and allosteric ABL inhibitors
(GNF-2; refs. 19, 20; preclinical). Although disease eradication remains on the horizon, the much anticipated, imminent clinical availability of ABLT315I inhibitors represents an
important step toward maximal disease control.
