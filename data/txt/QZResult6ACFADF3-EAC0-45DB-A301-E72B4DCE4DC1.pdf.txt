Abstract
Somatic mutations within the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) kinase domain are detected in 10% to 30%
of human non–small cell lung cancers and are correlated with
striking clinical responses in a subset of patients treated with
EGFR kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Cellbased studies suggest that these mutant EGFRs promote
increased autophosphorylating activity on a subset of EGFR
COOH-terminal tyrosines and the consequent engagement of a
subset of downstream effectors. Because EGFR function is
regulated at multiple levels in vivo, and it is therefore difficult
to assess the direct consequences of these mutations on EGFR
enzyme function, we measured EGFR catalytic activity in
in vitro kinase assays using purified recombinant proteins
corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of wild-type and
two frequently detected EGFR mutants (DelL747-P753insS and
L858R). Both mutants exhibit substantially increased autophosphorylating activity relative to wild-type EGFR, and they
exhibit distinct reaction kinetics. In addition, the mutant
kinases are more sensitive to kinase inhibition by gefitinib,
which seems to reflect their increased drug affinity. These
findings suggest that the altered signaling properties and drug
sensitivity of these EGFR mutants that have been observed
in vivo largely result from differences in the catalytic properties of the kinase. In addition, we find that the T790M
secondary ‘‘drug resistance mutation’’ of EGFR, which frequently arises in relapsed patients that initially responded to
treatment, confers enhanced kinase activity to primary activating EGFR alleles and may, therefore, be oncogenic in some
contexts. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2325–30]

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently
overexpressed in solid tumors (1). Recently, a novel class of
EGFR mutations has been identified in f10% to 30% of non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mutations arise in the kinase domain
(2–4) and consist of small in-frame deletions, missense substitutions, and small in-frame insertions/duplications. Nearly half of
all cases involve the substitution L858R. These mutations are

correlated with striking clinical responses to EGFR kinase
inhibitors [Iressa (gefitinib) and Tarceva (erlotinib)] in NSCLC
patients (2–4). However, most responders eventually develop drug
resistance, frequently associated with a secondary EGFR mutation,
T790M, which disrupts drug binding while preserving catalytic
function (5–7). Interestingly, the T790M allele is also detected
at low frequency in untreated NSCLCs, and germ line T790M
mutations have been detected in a family that exhibits inherited
predisposition to lung adenocarcinoma (8). Thus, the T790M
‘‘resistance’’ mutation may also confer oncogenic activity to EGFR.
Cell culture studies suggest that mutant EGFRs exhibit enhanced
autophosphorylating activity and increased activation of downstream signaling proteins and are sufficient to render NIH3T3
fibroblasts tumorigenic (9) and confer IL-3–independent growth
to BAF3 cells (10, 11). However, EGFR is subject to multiple levels
of regulation in vivo, including ligand binding, dimerization,
ubiquitination, and trafficking (12, 13). Consequently, cell-based
analysis might reflect multiple aspects of EGFR regulation.
Therefore, we compared the enzymatic activities of wild-type and
two frequently detected EGFR mutants using purified recombinant
proteins. Both mutants exhibit substantially increased autophosphorylating activity and increased gefitinib sensitivity, suggesting
that the altered signaling properties and drug sensitivity observed
in vivo largely reflect differences in catalytic properties of the kinase.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid construction. The EGFR intracellular domain corresponding
to wild-type and mutant human proteins was amplified using the
following oligonucleotides: 5¶-GCTCTAGAGGAGAAGCTCCCAAC-3¶ and
5¶-CGGGTACCTCATGCTCCAATAAA-3¶. Fragments were excised and subcloned into the pVLFlag baculovirus vector. Resulting inserts were confirmed
by DNA sequencing.
Cell culture. Serum-free adapted Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells
were from Invitrogen (Frederick, MD). Cells were cultivated in complete
sf-900 II serum-free medium optimized for insect cells (Invitrogen) without
antibiotics at 27jC.
Baculovirus production. Sf9 cells were transfected with baculovirus
vector containing EGFR inserts using the BD BaculoGold Transfection Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Viral containing supernatants were collected 3 to 4 days postinfection and
were used to infect 10-cm plates of Sf9 cells to increase viral titer. This was
repeated three to four times. The presence of recombinant protein was
confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody.
Protein purification. Cultures of log-phase Sf9 cells were infected with
viral supernatant. After 3 days, cells were treated with 22 Amol/L gefitinib
for 5 h to dephosphorylate EGFR. Cells were centrifuged at 2000  g for
5 min, and pellets were rinsed in PBS followed by centrifugation. Pellets
were resuspended in 5 mL cold homogenization buffer (HB) containing
25 mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and 10% glycerol

(including protease inhibitors). After 30 min, cells were dounced 30 times,
and cleared supernatant was incubated for 2 h with 200 AL slurry of M2
agarose beads (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). M2 beads were pelleted and rinsed six
times in HB containing 500 mmol/L NaCl. EGFR proteins were competed
from beads using 1 FLAG peptide (Sigma). SDS-PAGE was used to assess
the protein purity.
Larger scale protein production was done using a Wave Bioreactor System
20/50 (Wave Biotech, LLC, Somerset, NJ). In these cases, dephosphorylation
was accomplished using Yersinia tyrosine phosphatase (YopH). After cell
lysis, YopH was added to the cleared supernatant during overnight
incubation with M2 agarose beads at 4jC. Complete dephosphorylation
was observed using antiphosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate, Charlottesville, VA).
Kinase assays. About 20 ng of purified protein was used per reaction.
Reactions were carried out in 10 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
10 mmol/L MnCl2, 10% glycerol, and 10 Amol/L ATP (except where noted
otherwise). Reactions were done at 34jC and terminated using either
Laemmli sample buffer or 10 mmol/L EDTA after 20 min, unless otherwise
indicated. Radiolabeled proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE,
and gels were exposed on autoradiographic film.
EGFR autophosphorylation by rapid chemical quench. Rapid
chemical quench studies were done as previously described (14). After
various times (0.0260 s), the reaction was quenched with 67 AL of
50 mmol/L EDTA. Zero time points were determined by mixing enzyme
solution with 2 substrate solution without ATP at the longest reaction
times. Quenched reaction products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by blotting with phosphospecific antibodies. Phosphorylation
intensity was quantified using Labworks software.
Equilibrium fluorescence titrations to determine gefitinib affinity
to proteins. Equilibrium fluorescence measurements were made using
an SLM 4800C spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments, Rochester, NY). The
emission spectra (300–450 nm) of EGFR were obtained upon excitation at
285 nm. All measurements were made at 25jC with 2-nm slits for excitation
and 4-nm slits for emission. Aliquots of 0.5 AL of gefitinib (10 Amol/L) were
added to 0.6 mL of enzyme solution containing 200 nmol/L EGFR,
20 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH, 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L MnCl2, and 10%
glycerol until no further decrease in fluorescence was observed. Observed
fluorescence at 340 nm was then plotted versus total gefitinib concentration. Data were then fitted to the following expression relating observed
fluorescence to gefitinib concentration [IR]:
F ¼ Fmax  ðFmin  ½IRÞ=ðKd þ ½IRÞ

Purified EGFR mutant kinases exhibit increased kinase
activity and increased sensitivity to gefitinib. To examine
the catalytic properties of mutant EGFR kinases, we generated
recombinant baculoviruses encoding the cytoplasmic domain of
wild-type and two common EGFR lung cancer mutants (L858R and
DelL747-P753S, hereafter referred to as Del747-753; Fig. 1A). Upon
insect cell infection, each form of EGFR is expressed at comparable
levels; however, the two mutants exhibit substantially increased
total tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Phosphospecific antibodies revealed that the mutant EGFRs exhibit increased
phosphorylation on multiple sites, and phosphorylation is suppressed by gefitinib (Fig. 1B).
Next, we purified the EGFR intracellular domains for more
detailed in vitro enzyme assays (Fig. 2A), and the Del747-753 and
L858R EGFR kinases exhibited increased levels of tyrosine
phosphorylation compared with wild-type EGFR (Fig. 2B and C
and Supplementary Table S1). Similar to previous cell-based
assays, purified mutant EGFRs exhibit about 10-fold increased
sensitivity to gefitnib/erlotinib (2, 4); the EC50 for the purified wildtype kinase (22.8 nmol/L) is significantly higher than that observed
for the Del747-753 (5.9 nmol/L) and L858R (7.5 nmol/L) mutants
(Fig. 2D and E). These findings indicate that the increased

Protein immunodetection. For experiments in Sf9 cells, cells were
infected with equivalent amounts of baculovirus. After 3 days, they were
treated with the indicated amounts of gefitinib for 3 h and then lysed in
sample buffer. Equal amounts of lysates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE,
followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After 1 h of
filter blocking in 5% bovine serum albumin, membranes were incubated
overnight with antibody. A chemiluminesence reagent (Perkin-Elmer,
Boston, MA) was used to reveal the presence of tagged proteins. About
25% of the kinase reaction mixture was diluted in 140 AL of TBS and spotted
on a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration apparatus
from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking
solution (LI-COR International, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h, followed by overnight
incubation in primary antibody. Membranes were scanned and quantified
using the Odyssey IR imager.
Antibodies. The following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG (Sigma);
p-Tyr (Transduction Labs, San Jose, CA); Tyr845 and Tyr1173 (Cell Signaling
Technologies, Danvers, MA); Tyr992, Tyr1086, and Tyr1148 (Invitrogen); and
Tyr1045 and Tyr1068 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Both mouse and rabbit
secondary antibodies used were from either Cell Signaling Technologies
(Western blotting) or Rockland Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA; dot blotting).

autophosphorylating activity and drug sensitivity observed in vivo
reflects a direct consequence of mutation on catalytic properties of
the EGFR kinase domain.
Increased enzyme activity and altered substrate preference
of mutant EGFR proteins. Cell-based studies revealed that
mutant EGFRs selectively engage a subset of downstream
signaling pathways (15). Therefore, we did in vitro enzyme assays
with purified EGFR kinases, followed by immunoblotting of
reaction products with phosphospecific antibodies. Most residues
examined are more highly phosphorylated in the mutant proteins
(Fig. 3). For all tyrosines examined, except Y1173, Del747-753
exhibits higher phosphorylation than wild-type EGFR (Supplementary Table S1). The L858R mutant protein exhibits increased
phosphorylation on Y845, Y1045, Y1086, and Y1173. Importantly,
in all cases, the E max values were lower for wild-type enzyme.
These findings suggest that the mutants exhibit differential
reactivity with individual tyrosine-containing peptides within the
EGFR cytoplasmic domain. Notably, these two classes of EGFR
mutants each exhibit increased enzyme activity and increased
drug sensitivity, despite the fact that they would be predicted to
have substantially different structural consequences on the EGFR
catalytic pocket.
Increased catalytic rates of mutant EGFR kinases. Our
in vitro enzyme assays revealed that the two mutant EGFRs exhibit
increased autophosphorylating activity on several COOH-terminal
sites. However, the elevated activity in these assays was
considerably reduced relative to differences detected in Sf9 cells,
raising the possibility that in the in vitro assays, a relatively rapid
saturation of all sites occurs on all three forms of EGFR in the time
frame examined. Indeed, previous kinetic studies on recombinant
fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and ErbB2 showed that
autophosphorylation occurs in the millisecond to second time

frame (14).3 Therefore, we used rapid chemical quench methodology to compare reaction kinetics of wild-type and mutant kinases.
Between 0.02 and 60 s, we observed substantial differences in the
autophosphorylation profile between wild-type and mutant kinases
(Fig. 3B). For wild-type EGFR, Y992 is the only site detectably
phosphorylated in a 20-ms to 1-s time frame. Phosphorylation of
the other sites is not detected under these conditions until the 10to 60-s time domain, during which Y1068 seems to be phosphorylated. In contrast, the L858R mutant is autophosphorylated on
Y845, Y1045, and Y1068 residues at the 10-s time point. Interestingly,
all four tyrosine residues examined are phosphorylated at 0.02 s
on the Del747-753 mutant. These findings are consistent with a
substantially increased catalytic rate for the two mutant EGFR
kinases relative to the wild-type protein and additionally indicate
that the deletion and missense mutants exhibit distinct properties
with regard to their autophosphorylation reaction rates.
These findings suggest a specific ordering of autophosphorylation for activated EGFR, which may be perturbed by mutation.
Transient kinetic studies of the ErbB2 and FGFR kinases have
similarly pointed to rapidly ordered autophosphorylation as a likely
regulatory mechanism (14, 16). Moreover, the temporal dynamics of
receptor phosphorylation have also been suggested to be important
for EGFR signaling (17). If such ordering is influenced by the
conformation of the catalytic pocket, it is conceivable that
activating EGFR mutations could impact the ordered phosphorylation of COOH-terminal tyrosines and consequently affect
signaling function.

There may not always be direct parallels between in vitro model
systems and ligand-stimulated cells. Indeed, the in vitro studies
described here revealed some differences from previous cell-based
studies regarding the ‘‘preferred’’ autophosphorylation sites of
mutant EGFRs (15). Notably, the potential contribution of receptor
dimerization to kinase activity and substrate selectivity of mutant
EGFRs cannot be readily addressed in vitro. Therefore, efforts are
under way to examine rapid kinetics of wild-type and mutant
EGFRs immediately following ligand stimulation in cell culture.
Mutant EGFR kinases exhibit increased gefitinib affinity.
One mechanism by which increased kinase activity could arise is
that mutant enzymes, due to structural change within the catalytic
pocket, exhibit increased ATP affinity. We did in vitro kinase assays
using a range of ATP concentrations. Both the Del747-753 and the
L858R mutants remain quite active even at the lowest ATP

concentration tested (Supplementary Fig. S1A). However, at higher
ATP concentrations, approaching physiologic levels, it is not
possible to discriminate between the activity of wild-type and
mutant kinases, suggesting that differences in ATP affinity may not
be significant in vivo.
Next, we directly examined the affinity of wild-type and mutant
EGFR kinases for gefitinib by conducting equilibrium fluorescence
titration experiments. We previously showed in studies with the
HER-2 kinase that there is a conserved tryptophan near the
active site that can be used to monitor nucleotide/inhibitor
binding affinity (16). For this analysis, an in vitro assay of purified
EGFRs was used in which the change in intrinsic tryptophan
fluorescence can be monitored at a range of gefitinib concentrations to determine the direct binding affinity (K d; Supplementary Fig. S1B). The K d for the wild-type EGFR was f5 times that of

the L858R mutant and f13 times that of the Del747-753 mutant
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Thus, these mutants exhibit significantly
increased gefitnib affinity in vitro, possibly contributing to their
increased drug sensitivity in tumors.
Our observation that mutant EGFR kinases are more effectively
inhibited by gefitinib is consistent with our equilibrium
fluorescence titrations to establish that the mutant kinases
exhibit increased affinity for gefitinib, which competes for ATP
binding in the catalytic pocket. A recent report concluded that
these mutant EGFRs do not differ detectably from wild-type
EGFR in gefitnib affinity (18). However, in that study, assays were
done with the isolated kinase domain expressed on a bacteriophage particle and lacked the COOH-terminal autophosphorylation sites. Another recent report suggests that, similar to our
findings, the Del746-750 mutant exhibits increased gefitnib
affinity (19). A recent study of purified EGFR cytoplasmic
domains corresponding to the same mutants described here also
concluded that the mutant EGFRs exhibit increased catalytic
activity and erlotinib sensitivity (20). In their assay, the mutants
exhibited an increased K m for ATP for peptide substrate
phosphorylation, potentially accounting for increased drug
sensitivity.
The T790M mutation causes increased phosphorylation on
several tyrosine residues. The T790M secondary mutation in
EGFR has been detected in many patients with acquired resistance
to gefitinib treatment (5, 7). Because this mutation has also
been detected in some tumors in combination (in cis) with

additional activating EGFR kinase mutations (8), we tested the
possibility that such ‘‘double mutants’’ exhibit increased catalytic
activity. We expressed recombinant EGFRs containing either
T790M alone or coupled with the L858R mutation in insect cells
and assayed phosphorylation. EGFR T790M exhibits tyrosine
phosphorylation levels comparable to wild-type EGFR, whereas
the T790M/L858R double mutant exhibits a substantial increase
in phosphorylation on several sites (Fig. 4). Thus, the T790M
resistance mutation, when combined with activating EGFR kinase
domain mutations, confers significantly enhanced catalytic phosphorylating activity, suggesting that these mutations ‘‘cooperate’’
to produce a more potent kinase, and potentially explaining the
additional role of T790M in predisposing to tumorigenesis. The
fact that T790M has been linked to the acquisition of resistance to
EGFR inhibitors (5, 7) and to inherited lung cancer predisposition
(8) suggests a dual role in cancer, both as an oncogene and in
conferring drug resistance.
