Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are characterized by activating mutations of KIT or platelet-derived
growth factor receptor a(PDGFRA), which can be therapeutically targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
such as imatinib. Despite long-lasting responses, most patients eventually progress after TKI therapy. The
calcium-dependent chloride channel DOG1 (ANO1/TMEM16A), which is strongly and speciﬁcally expressed in
GIST, is used as a diagnostic marker to differentiate GIST from other sarcomas. Here, we report that loss of DOG1
expression occurs together with loss of KIT expression in a subset of GIST resistant to KIT inhibitors, and we
illustrate the functional role of DOG1 in tumor growth, KIT expression, and imatinib response. Although DOG1 is
a crucial regulator of chloride balance in GIST cells, we found that RNAi-mediated silencing or pharmacologic
inhibition of DOG1 did not alter cell growth or KIT signaling in vitro. In contrast, DOG1 silencing delayed the
growth of GIST xenografts in vivo. Expression proﬁling of explanted tumors after DOG1 blockade revealed a strong
upregulation in the expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), a potent antiangiogenic
factor implicated in tumor suppression. Similar results were obtained after selection of imatinib-resistant DOG1and KIT-negative cells derived from parental DOG1 and KIT-positive GIST cells, where a 5,000-fold increase in
IGFBP5 mRNA transcripts were documented. In summary, our ﬁndings establish the oncogenic activity of DOG1
in GIST involving modulation of IGF/IGF receptor signaling in the tumor microenvironment through the
antiangiogenic factor IGFBP5. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3661–70. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and are
characterized by activating mutations in the KIT or plateletderived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRA) genes (1–3).
Imatinib mesylate (IM) is a small molecule inhibitor of
several oncogenic tyrosine kinases, including KIT and PDGFRA.
About 85% of patients with metastatic GIST derive substantial
clinical beneﬁt from IM treatment; however, imatinib does not
cure metastatic GIST and the majority of patients eventually
progress. Second, imatinib-resistant KIT mutations within the
ATP-binding and activation loop domain are commonly found

in IM-resistant GIST and are believed to be the major mechanism of resistance (4–7).
The protein DOG1 (discovered on GIST-1) encoded by ANO1
(also known as TMEM16A) is a calcium-dependent chloride
channel (CaCC; refs. 8–10). CaCCs are involved in diverse
physiologic processes including gastrointestinal rhythmic contractions (11, 12). Notably, DOG1 was found to be highly
expressed both in GIST (13) and in interstitial cells of Cajal
(ICC), the putative cell-of-origin of GIST (14, 15).
In clinical practice, DOG1 is a sensitive immunohistochemical marker for GIST and is preserved in 36% of GIST that lack
KIT expression or activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA (16–
18). However, DOG1 biologic functions have not been characterized in GIST. To shed light on the relevance of DOG1 for
GIST tumorigenesis, we evaluated the impact of DOG1 expression and activity in various GIST models, both in vitro and
in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
GIST-T1 and GIST882 were established from human,
untreated, metastatic GISTs. GIST-T1 contains a 57bp deletion
in c-KIT exon 11 (19). GIST882 harbors a homozygous exon 13
missense mutation, resulting in a single amino acid substitution, K642E (20). GIST48 and GIST430 were established from
GIST that had progressed, after initial clinical response, during

IM therapy. GIST48 has a primary, homozygous exon 11
missense mutation (V560D) and a heterozygous secondary
exon 17 (kinase activation loop) mutation (D820A). GIST430
has a primary heterozygous exon 11 in-frame deletion and a
heterozygous secondary exon 13 missense mutation.
GIST882B, GIST48B, and GIST430B are sublines, which despite
retaining the activating KIT mutation in all cells, express KIT
transcript and protein at essentially undetectable levels.
GIST62 was derived from an untreated KIT-positive GIST with
KIT exon 11 in-frame mutation, but the cell line, despite
retaining the activating KIT mutation in all cells, expresses
KIT transcript and protein at essentially undetectable levels
(21). GIST5 and GIST474 were established from imatinibtreated GISTs, and lacked KIT expression in the primary and
subsequent cultures, although they retain the KIT exon 11
mutations of the parental GIST population.
Stable short hairpin RNA transfection
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus for human DOG1
(NM_018043) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (MISSION
shRNA Lentiviral Transduction Particles TRCN0000040263).
GIST cells were grown to 80% conﬂuence and then infected
with 1 multiplicity of infection of either nontargeting scrambled shRNA (SHC002V) control particles or DOG1 shRNA
lentiviral particles in medium containing 8 mg/mL polybrene.
Fresh medium containing 4 mg/mL puromycin was added after
48 hours to select for puromycin-resistant cells.
Reagents and antibodies
Imatinib mesylate (IM) was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. 17-N-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)
was purchased from Calbiochem (Merck). A rabbit polyclonal
antibody against KIT was from DAKO and a monoclonal rabbit
antibody against DOG1 was from Diagnostic BioSystems.
Polyclonal rabbit antibodies for phospho-KIT Y703 were from
Cell Signaling. b-actin antibody was purchased from SigmaAldrich.
In vitro assays
BrdUrd incorporation assay. Cells were incubated with 1
mmol/L bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 2.5 hours (GIST-T1)
or 24 hours (GIST882) at 37 C and processed using the
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) BrdUrd Flow Kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy,
1.5  106 trypsinized cells were ﬁxed, permeabilized, and
digested with DNAse. Cells were then stained with FITCconjugated anti-BrdUrd and 7-amino-actinomycin followed
immediately by ﬂow cytometric analysis. Ten thousand events
of each sample were acquired on a Beckman Coulter FC500
Flow Cytometer.
Sulforhodamine B. The sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
was used according to the method of Skehan and colleagues
(22). Cells were plated in 96-well ﬂat-bottomed plates. After 24
hours, culture medium was replaced with fresh medium (with
or without respective drugs) in triplicate or quadruplicate
cultures. At the end of drug exposure (72 hours), cells were
ﬁxed for 1 hour and stained with 0.4% SRB (Sigma Aldrich), and
the optical density was detected at 560 nm. Each experiment

was repeated 3 times and ﬁgures depict a representative result.
The speciﬁc DOG1 inhibitor A01 was kindly provided by Prof.
Alan Verkman (University of California, San Francisco, CA).
Whole-cell patch-clamp. Whole-cell membrane currents
were recorded in GIST-T1 and GIST882 cell lines. The extracellular (bath) solution had the following composition: 150
mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L
glucose, 10 mmol/L mannitol, 10 mmol/L Na-HEPES (pH ¼
7.4). The pipette (intracellular) solution contained 130 mmol/L
CsCl, 10 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1
mmol/L ATP (pH 7.4) plus CaCl2 to obtain the desired free
Ca2þ concentration: 8 mmol/L for 305 nmol/L (calculated with
Patcher's Power Tool developed by Dr. Francisco Mendes and
Franz Wurriehausen, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical
Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany).
During experiments, the membrane capacitance and series
resistance were analogically compensated using the circuitry
provided by the EPC7 patch-clamp ampliﬁer. The usual protocol for stimulation consisted of 600 ms long voltage steps
from 100 to 100 mV in 20 mV increments starting from a
holding potential of 60 mV. The waiting time between steps
was 4 seconds. Membrane currents were ﬁltered at 1 kHz and
digitized at 5 kHz with an ITC-16 (Instrutech) AD/DA converter. Data were analyzed using the Igor software (Wavemetrics) supplemented by custom software kindly provided by
Dr. Oscar Moran (Istituto di bioﬁsica, Genova, Italy).
Western blotting. Whole-cell protein lysates were prepared from cell line monolayers according to standard protocols
(23). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad
Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Proteins were separated
by SDS/PAGE as described by Laemmli and colleagues (24) and
transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). Changes in protein expression and phosphorylation
as visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL chemi-luminescent
reagent, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were captured and
quantiﬁed using a FUJI LAS3000 system with Science Lab
2001 ImageGauge 4.0 software (Fujiﬁlm Medial Systems).
In vivo studies
Tumor growth in vivo was evaluated by subcutaneously
injecting the rear ﬂanks of 6- to 8-week-old female adult
athymic nude mice (NMRI nu/nu) with 10 million cells per
ﬂank transfected with scrambled or DOG1 shRNA. Tumor
growth was monitored biweekly with a caliper, and tumor
volumes were calculated by [(length  width2)/2]. The experiment was stopped, mice were sacriﬁced, and tumors were
harvested when controls reached approximately 1 cm3. Statistical analysis of the mean tumor volumes was done by pairwise
comparison using one-tailed homoscedastic t test analysis.
Immunhistochemical staining
Four micrometer sections of parafﬁn-embedded tissues of
xenograft samples were cut and mounted onto SuperFrost Plus
coated slides (Langenbrinck) for immunohistochemical staining. Heat-induced antigen retrieval (waterbath) was carried
out with Target Retrieval Solution Citrate buffer (Dako) at pH
6.0 or HIER T-EDTA buffer (Zytomed Systems) at pH 9.0.
Specimens were stained with a monoclonal rabbit anti-DOG1

RNA isolation and microarray gene expression proﬁling
Total RNA of cell line monolayers and tumor samples were
isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Residual traces of genomic DNA
were removed with DNase I (Qiagen). RNA concentration and
purity were determined photometrically (NanoDrop, Thermo
scientiﬁc). Preparation of cRNA targets (5 mg total RNA),
fragmentation, hybridization of HG-U133 plus 2.0 microarrays
(Affymetrix), washing, staining, and scanning were conducted
according to manufacturer's protocols (Affymetrix) by the
BioChip-Labor (Dr. Klein-Hitpass, Institute for Cell Biology,
University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany). Signal intensities and detection calls were determined using Affymetrix
microarray suite, version 5.0. Comparison ﬁles were further
ﬁltered to detect differentially expressed genes.

Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA extraction was conducted as described above, and cDNA
synthesis was conducted using the RevertAid H Minus First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from Thermo Scientiﬁc. Quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using TaqMan chemistry on the Roche LightCycler 480 (Roche) using the standard
curve method in triplicate, as previously described (25). Probes
for DOG1 (Hs00216121_m1), LTN1 (listerin E3 ubiquitin protein

Whole transcriptome sequencing rRNA was depleted from 5
mg of total RNA using biotinylated oligonucleotides (Ribominus, Invitrogen), and libraries were constructed from the
rRNA-depleted RNA according to the SOLiD Total RNA-seq

involved fragmentation of the RNA by RNAse III to an average
size of 150 bases, ligation of the fragmented RNA to adaptors in
a directed orientation, then cDNA synthesis, and PCR ampliﬁcation of the resulting library. Approximately, 50 bases were
sequenced from one end of each fragment using either the

carrying shRNAs against DOG1 (sequence: CCGGCGTCGAGTTCAACGACAGAAACTCGAGTTTCTGTCGTTGAACTCGACG TTTTTG). This resulted in a 91% reduction of DOG1
protein levels, whereas nonsense shRNA (scrambled) treatment did not alter DOG1 expression. Expression and activation
of KIT and KIT-dependent signaling pathways were not altered
by DOG1 knockdown (Fig. 2A).
Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were carried out to
conﬁrm the functional effect of DOG1 reduction on chloride
currents. Notably, DOG1 knockdown resulted in a 96% inhibition of chloride efﬂux in GIST-T1 and 90% in GIST882
compared with the controls, underscoring that DOG1 is a
crucial regulator of GIST cell chlorine balance (Fig. 2B).
To assess the impact of DOG1 knockdown on cell proliferation, we conducted BrdUrd incorporation assays. Suppression
of DOG1 did not signiﬁcantly alter the proliferation of GIST-T1
and GIST882 cells in vitro (Fig. 2C). Moreover, IM sensitivity
was maintained in both cell lines despite DOG1 knockdown,
with IC50 values of 20 nmol/L and 50 nmol/L for GIST-T1 and
GIST882 (Fig. 2D).

tumor growth of GIST-T1, GIST882, and GIST430 in vivo. As
shown in Fig. 4, DOG1 knockdown effectively suppressed
DOG1 in all xenograft models (exempliﬁed for GIST-T1 and
GIST882), whereas xenografts from parental cells (no lentiviral
transduction) and control cells (expressing scrambled shRNA)
retained DOG1 expression as measured by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4A) and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, GIST-T1 tumors with DOG1 knockdown had lower
proliferative activity (Ki-67: 60% positive cells in knockdown
tumors vs. 90% in control tumors) resulting in a signiﬁcant
reduction (mean 43%) of tumor size after 19 days (n ¼ 8; P ¼
0.003) compared with controls (Fig. 4C). A substantial growth
delay (mean 31%) was also observed in GIST430, which exhibits
an intrinsically slower tumor growth compared with GIST-T1.
Notably, DOG1 knockdown did not alter the growth of GIST882
xenografts.

Biochemical inhibitors of CaCCs do not affect GIST cell
growth in vitro
To further explore the functional impact of the DOG1 CaCC
on GIST survival, GIST-T1 and GIST882 cells were treated for 3
days with 3 biochemical inhibitors of CaCCs, niﬂumic acid
(NAC), 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB),
and A01 (being most speciﬁc for DOG1). At active concentrations (26), none of these CaCC inhibitors signiﬁcantly reduced
cell viability. The inhibition of GIST-T1 by A01 at 10 mmol/L
(34%) was seen in both DOG1 knockdown and control cells and
is therefore not a DOG1-speciﬁc effect (Fig. 3). Taken together,
these ﬁndings argue against a cell-autonomous activity of
DOG1 in GIST biology.

Analysis of gene expression data suggests IGFBP5
regulation by DOG1
To better understand the molecular consequences of DOG1
knockdown, we conducted expression arrays using Affymetrix
HG-U133 plus 2.0 arrays containing 54,675 probe sets representing more than 24,568 human genes. Changes in expression were found in more than 1,500 genes after DOG1
knockdown in cell lines and in more than 3,500 genes after
DOG1 knockdown in xenografts when compared with controls. As expected, DOG1 (ANO1) was among the top-ranking
differentially expressed genes. Other genes with strong differential expression are shown in Fig. 5 and Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2. Comprehensive pathway analyses were
conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems). For those, a fold-change cutoff was set at 1 to identify
genes whose expression was signiﬁcantly differentially up- or
downregulated.

DOG1 knockdown inhibits growth of GIST xenografts in
nude mice
As DOG1 might be involved tumor–host interactions in
GIST, we next investigated the effect of DOG1 knockdown on

Comparison of microarray data with qRT-PCR data
We conducted a literature search on the 40 top-ranking,
differentially expressed genes. Genes that might have an
impact on proliferation or apoptosis were selected for qRTPCR validation. Among these candidates, a substantial (> 3-

fold) difference in expression levels was found for DOG1 and
IGFBP5, whereas levels of other candidates were only marginally changed (Fig. 6A). IGFBP5 levels decreased in
GIST882 upon DOG1 knockdown (Fig. 6B). In DOG1-negative GIST882B, IGFBP5 transcript counts were unchanged
compared with the parental DOG1-positive GIST882 cell
line. Notably, DOG1-negative GIST430B cell line showed
IGFBP5 transcriptome sequencing counts that were 5,000fold higher than that in the parental DOG1-positive
GIST430 cell line (Fig. 6C). The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
suggested the IGF pathway together with paxillin signaling as the top-ranking pathways affected by the DOG1
knockdown.

With the introduction of imatinib, a potent KIT inhibitor, the
treatment of GIST as a mainly KIT/PDGFRA-driven sarcoma
has been revolutionized. Most patients whose tumors harbor
activating KIT mutations beneﬁt from IM-treatment with a
median progression-free survival of 12 to 24 months (27).
Although a subset of patients remains free of progression, the
majority eventually progress, at which point their therapeutic
options are limited. Novel treatment strategies to prevent or
overcome resistance are therefore urgently needed.
DOG1 (Ano1/TMEM16A), a CaCC, was identiﬁed in microarray studies among a number of genes whose expression was
signiﬁcantly higher in GIST than in other soft tissue sarcomas
(13, 28). It has since then proven to be a reliable immunohistochemical marker in pathologic practice (17). Mutations of
DOG1 have not been found in GIST (29) but expression levels
are also high in ICC, the cells thought to share a common
progenitor with GIST (14, 15). Whether DOG1 is a lineagespeciﬁc marker that plays a role in differentiation or also might
play a transforming role in GIST is yet unclear.
To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to investigate DOG1
biologic roles and to assess DOG1 relevance as therapeutic
target in GIST.
Pathologic and genetic analyses from resected metastases
progressing on imatinib have revealed secondary KIT mutations as a common mechanism of resistance. In a subset of
patients, GIST metastases have lost KIT expression, indicating
that KIT oncogenic programs have been supplanted by yet
unidentiﬁed alternative oncogenic drivers (30). We observed a
similar phenomenon in sublines of several GIST cell lines,
which lost KIT expression during cultivation ex vivo. Interestingly, these cell lines also lost DOG1 expression suggesting
interdependence of expression. Notably, the majority of KITnegative GIST tumors (64%) in clinical practice also do not
express DOG1 (17).
In the studies reported herein, DOG1 knockdown resulted in
strong functional inhibition of chloride currents but did not
affect expression or activation of KIT and KIT-dependent
signaling pathways (Fig. 2A; data not shown). In our models,
DOG1 therefore does not act as key regulator of KIT, and our
studies suggest that DOG1 inhibition will not synergize with
KIT kinase–inhibitor drugs in inactivating KIT. Whether DOG1
expression is directly coregulated with KIT is yet unknown;
however, biochemical inhibition of KIT does not affect DOG1
expression (Fig. 1C) in vitro. We further showed that neither
DOG1 knockdown nor biochemical inhibitors of DOG1 alter
the growth modulating effect of imatinib in vitro. However, we
observed a substantial growth delay when GIST-T1 and
GIST430 were grown as xenografts compared with scrambled
controls in nude mice. This effect was not seen in GIST882.
DOG1 is expressed in many organs (e.g., salivary glands) and
DOG1 knockout mice die soon after birth (10, 31, 32). Little is
known about DOG1 expression in human tissues but the
UniGene database suggests an expression pattern similar to
that in mice (33). Nonetheless, DOG1 expression is still remarkably high in both GIST and ICCs compared with non-GIST
sarcomas (13, 16). Notably, Stanich and colleagues showed
growth inhibitory effects after DOG1 knockdown and DOG1

DOG1 in GIST

region containing DOG1, is frequently seen in breast, bladder,
head and neck, and esophageal cancer (36). Patients with
squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN)
harboring 11q13 ampliﬁcations were associated with a poor
prognosis. These ﬁndings were recently conﬁrmed by functional studies in SCCHN cell lines that showed that DOG1
ampliﬁcation was associated with increased spreading,
detachment, and invasion of tumor cells (37). Similar to our
ﬁndings, Duvvuri and colleagues observed inhibition of tumor
growth in SCCHN xenografts after knockdown of DOG1 (38).
Notably, this effect was also seen in vitro.
We did not ﬁnd published evidence that provides simple
answers as to why a DOG1 knockdown would affect cell growth
in vivo but not in vitro, as seen in our models. We speculate that
the more complex cell–cell interaction in 3-dimensional tumors
compared with monolayers as well as a tumor/hostinteraction
(e.g., vasculature) may be responsible for this effect.
Using gene expression analyses, we investigated differentially expressed genes that are directly associated with proliferation or survival. Pathway analyses using Ingenuity software
suggested IGF- and paxillin signaling as the most relevant
pathways affected by DOG1 knockdown. Although the change
of expression levels of genes involved in the paxillin pathway
was subtle, IGFBP5 was the strongest differentially expressed
gene besides DOG1 as conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR. In line with
these ﬁndings, the GIST cell line GIST430B, a KIT-negative, and
DOG1-negative subline of imatinib-resistant GIST430, showed
a 5,000-fold increase of IGFBP5 transcripts compared with its
parental DOG1-positive GIST430 cell line. IGFBP5 was not
upregulated in GIST882 following DOG1 knockdown, and no
growth delay was observed in vivo suggesting that IGFBP5 may
not be relevant to all GIST.
IGFBP5 is one of the 6 IGFBP family members and is
dysregulated in diverse types of cancer including breast cancer
(39), ovarian cancer (40), and Rb (41). IGFBP5 overexpression
results in "trapping" of IGF1 and IGF2 with subsequent inhibition of the IGF axis pathway (42). Of note, IGFBP5 has
recently been shown to suppress tumor growth and metastasis
of human osteosarcomas (43). In another model, IGFBP5
overexpression prevented tumor growth by inhibition of tumor
vascularity, which might explain the different biologic outcomes we found between our in vivo and in vitro experiments.
Interestingly, IGF2 expression has recently been shown to
predict a high mitotic index correlating with outcome in GIST
underlining the relevance of the IGF axis in GIST (44). DOG1
expression was also reported to promote tumor growth
through activation of the (MAPK) pathway (38), which we did
not observe in our models (data not shown). Of note, MAPK

activation in imatinib-sensitive GIST models is usually strongly
dependent on KIT activation (45).
Given its high levels of expression, DOG1 could represent a
tumor-speciﬁc target in GIST. Tumor growth in our models
was not dependent on DOG1 in vitro and only partially dependent in vivo. These ﬁndings suggest a potential therapeutic role
only in combination with other drugs. In addition, further
efforts are needed to identify biochemical inhibitors with
improved selectivity for DOG1, which recapitulate the effects
seen upon DOG1 knockdown in vivo. At present, clinical
evaluation of DOG1 inhibitors may be constrained by their
concomitant inhibition of other chloride channels.
Our results highlight the functional relevance of DOG1 in a
subset of GIST and suggest that further studies are warranted
to better understand DOG1 and IGF1 axis growth regulation
roles in GIST.
