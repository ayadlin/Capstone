ABSTRACT
SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, and histone deacetylase inhibitors
(HDACis) such as belinostat, vorinostat and panobinostat, have all been shown to
be deactivated by glucuronidation via UGTs. Since they all compete for UGTs for
deactivation, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of various HDACis on the
glucuronidation of SN-38. This inhibitory effect was determined by measuring the
formation rate of SN-38 glucuronide after SN-38 incubation with human recombinant
UGT1A isoforms (1A1, 1A6, 1A7 and 1A9) and pooled human liver microsomes (HLM,
wild type, UGT1A1*1*28 and UGT1A1*28*28 allelic variants), with and without
HDACis. The data showed that belinostat at 100 and 200 µmol/L inhibited SN-38
glucuronidation via UGT1A1 in a dose-dependent manner, causing significant decrease
in Vmax and CLint (p < 0.05) from 12.60 to 1.95 pmol/min/mg and 21.59 to 4.20 μL/
min/mg protein respectively. Similarly, in HLMs, Vmax dropped from 41.13 to 10.54,
24.96 to 3.77 and 6.23 to 3.30 pmol/min/mg, and CLint reduced from 81.25 to 26.11,
29.22 to 6.10 and 5.40 to 1.34 µL/min/mg protein for the respective wild type,
heterozygous and homozygous variants. Interestingly, belinostat at 200 µmol/L that
is roughly equivalent to the average Cmax, 183 µmol/L of belinostat at a dose of 1,400
mg/m2 given intravenously once per day on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks, was able to
inhibit both heterozygous and homozygous variants to same extents (~64%). This
highlights the potential clinical significance, as a large proportion of patients could be
at risk of developing severe toxicity if irinotecan is co-administered with belinostat.

for severe toxicity; irinotecan is one such agent whose
interactions with other drugs may lead to severe toxicities
such as diarrhoea and neutropenia [2, 3].
Irinotecan is an effective antitumour agent,
displaying a broad range of clinical activities against
neoplastic disorders such as colorectal, gynaecological and
lung cancers [4, 5]. This drug is predominantly converted
by carboxylesterases (CES) in the liver to SN-38, an
active metabolite that is 100-1000 times more potent
than irinotecan [6-9]. The potent SN-38 is then primarily
deactivated by glucuronidation catalyzed by UGT1A1
to SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) [10-12]. Other UGT1A
isoforms such as UGT1A6, UGT1A7 and UGT1A9, have
also been reported to play a role in the formation of SN38G [2, 13-15].
An illuminating example of toxicity caused by
accumulation of SN-38 can be attributed to the functional
polymorphism of UGT1A1. Genetic polymorphisms in
UGT1A1 have been demonstrated to have great impact
on SN-38 toxicity through influencing enzyme activity,
leading to inter-individual differences in drug response [13,
16-18]. Notably, when compared to wildtype genotype,
patients expressing the UGT1A1*28 allele experienced
significant irinotecan treatment-related toxicity (p < 0.001)
due to decreased (1.3 to 3.9 fold lower) enzymatic activity
in liver microsomes. This resulted in reduced SN-38G
formation and higher levels of SN-38 [3]. Similarly, any
potential DDI with irinotecan that increases the serum
levels of SN-38 could also cause severe undesirable
toxicity. For instance, co-administration of ketoconazole
and irinotecan to cancer patients resulted in a significant
increase in the formation of SN-38, at least partially due to
the inhibitory effect of ketoconazole on UGT1A1 [19,20].
Thus, it is important to investigate the probable interaction
of irinotecan with other anti-cancer agents and to prevent
such treatment-related toxicity.
Hydroxamic acid histone deacetylase inhibitors
have emerged as a promising class of anti-cancer drugs
in recent years [21,22]. They enhance histone acetylation
and increase the expression of tumour suppressor genes,
thereby inducing growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer
cells [23-25]. It is also believed that they are capable of
sensitising drug resistant cancer cells to anticancer drugs
in combination therapy [26, 27]. The most commonly
used HDACis in the hydroxamate class include belinostat,
vorinostat and panobinostat. It has been shown that all
3 HDACis undergo intensive metabolism via phase II
glucuronidation [28-30]. In particular, belinostat, like
irinotecan, has recently been discovered to utilise the
same phase II metabolic pathway involving the highly
polymorphic enzyme, UGT1A1 [28]. Therefore, we
hypothesise that HDACis may inhibit the UGT1A
isoforms in phase II metabolism, resulting in reduced
conversion of SN-38 to SN-38G and greater accumulation
of SN-38.
Our objective was to investigate the potential
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

presence of glucuronidation-mediated DDI in combination
therapies of irinotecan with HDACis. Belinostat was
approved for peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) by
FDA recently [31], whereas vorinostat is FDA-approved
for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) [32]. This
investigation would then play a vital role in helping
clinicians make more informed decisions regarding
possible combination chemotherapy. Moreover, our
results would also provide vital information to formulation
scientists if these combinations of drugs are considered to
be formulated together.
In this study, we assessed the inhibitory effects
of belinostat on SN-38 glucuronidation in vitro using
UGT1A1 enzymes, and its inhibitory effects were
further confirmed using 3 types of pooled human liver
microsomes (HLMs) (50 donor pool, UGT1A1*1*28 and
UGT1A1*28*28 allelic variants). Significant associations
were observed between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms
and SN-38G formation rates in the absence and presence
of belinostat. Besides, we also studied the possible
inhibitory effects of other HDACis, including vorinostat
and panobinostat on SN-38 glucuronidation.

RESULTS
LC-MS/MS method validation
The chromatographic data were acquired and
analysed using the Analyst v1.4.2 software package
(Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX). The LC-MS/MS
analysis was highly specific and selective as the peaks
have a symmetrical resolution, with no interference around
the retention time (tR) of the analytes. The retention times
were as follows: SN38 and SN-38-d3 eluting at tR = 4.24
min, and SN-38G and SN-38G-d3 eluting at tR = 3.97 min
(Figure 1). Accuracy was expressed as the percentage
of the mean value measured over the true value of QC
samples, whereas precision at each QC concentration was
expressed as the coefficient of variation by calculating
the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean
calculated concentration. Briefly, excellent linearity of
SN-38 and SN-38G was demonstrated to be within the
range of 10 to 500 nmol/L. A weighting factor of 1/x was
used to minimise deviations from the slope of the curve
at lower concentrations resulting from bigger variance
at higher concentrations. Good linearity was achieved,
with a coefficient of determination (r2) of > 0.996 for
both SN-38 and SN-38G. This implied a strong linear
relationship between the peak area ratio and concentration.
The intra-day and inter-day precisions and accuracies
for QC samples were summarised in Table 1. The intraday precision was between 1.26-2.41% for SN-38 and
1.62-6.24% for SN-38G and the inter-day precision was
1.67-3.38% for SN-38 and 4.22-8.30% for SN-38G. The

Belinostat was also found to strongly inhibit SN38 glucuronidation by the 3 types of pooled HLMs (50
donor pool, UGT1A1*1*28 and UGT1A1*28*28 allelic
variants) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3). The
50 donor pool HLMs, were used to represent the wildtype homozygote for (TA)6TAA allele (6/6), while the
UGT1A1*1*28 and UGT1A1*28*28 allelic variant
HLMs are heterozygote (6/7) and homozygote (7/7) for
(TA)7TAA allele, respectively. Based on the analysis of

As the concentration of belinostat increased, the
formation rate of SN-38G decreased in a dose-dependent
manner, demonstrating an increase in the inhibition of
SN-38 glucuronidation (Figure 2A), thus suggesting that
the inhibition type was non-competitive. Upon addition
of belinostat at 100 and 200 μmol/L, intrinsic clearance

the Michaelis-Menten graphs (Figure 3A, 3C and 3E),
belinostat also showed non-competitive inhibition against
SN-38 glucuronidation by HLMs. In the 50 donor pool
HLMs (6/6) (Figure 3B), belinostat showed the highest
inhibitory effect at 200 μmol/L, significantly decreasing
the CLint by 68%, from 81.25 to 26.11 μL/min/mg protein
(p < 0.05). At 100 μmol/L of belinostat, CLint was also

significantly decreased by 56%, from 81.25 to 36.01 μL/
min/mg protein (p < 0.05). In the UGT1A1*1*28 (6/7) and
UGT1A1*28*28 (7/7) allelic variant HLMs (Figure 3D
and 3F), similar significant decreases were detected, where
CLint dropped by 79% (from 29.22 to 6.10 µL/min/mg
protein) and 75% (from 5.40 to 1.34 µL/min/mg protein),
respectively at 200 μmol/L of belinostat (p < 0.05).

Our results also suggested the association of
UGT1A1 genetic polymorphism and the inhibitory
effect of belinostat on SN-38G formation. As illustrated
in Figure 4A, SN-38 glucuronidation activities (Vmax)
decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the samples using
variant 6/7 and 7/7 genotypes (24.96 pmol/min/mg and
6.23 pmol/min/mg, respectively), as compared to the
samples with wild type 6/6 genotypes (41.13 pmol/min/
mg). Moreover, co-administration of 10, 100, or 200
μmol/L belinostat and SN-38 led to further reduction in
the SN-38G formation rates and this reduction occurred
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B-4D). In particular
for 200 μmol/L of belinostat (Figure 4D), the rates of SN38G formation were nearly similar for both variant 6/7
heterozygous and 7/7 homozygous genotypes, at 3.77
pmol/min/mg (decreased by ~ 64% compared to wild type)
and 3.30 pmol/min/mg (decreased by ~ 68% compared
to wild type), respectively, suggesting that belinostat, at
high concentrations, is able to inhibit both heterozygous
and homozygous genotypes to a similar extent. This
implied that patients with heterozygous genotype may
develop severe toxicity similar to that of the homozygous
genotype, if a high dose of belinostat is prescribed.
Since large populations worldwide are found to have

heterozygous UGT1A1*28 genotype and it is thought to
be at a lower risk of developing irrinotecan-related toxicity
as compared to the homozygous genotype [14, 36], our
finding can be clinically relevant as it may prompt extra
caution when the combination of irinotecan and belinostat
is given to patients with heterozygous genotype. Further
investigation is warranted to confirm this finding in vivo.

Effects of vorinostat on SN-38 glucuronidation by
UGT1A9
At a therapeutic concentration of vorinostat (2
µmol/L), no significant inhibition of UGT1A9 was
observed. CLint of SN-38G increased from 7.48 to 12.12
μL/min/mg protein when incubated without and with
vorinostat respectively, but the increase was found to be
insignificant (p > 0.05).

Effects of panobinostat on SN-38 glucuronidation
by UGT1A isoforms
Panobinostat, at both concentrations (20 and 200
nmol/L), was not found to have any inhibitory effect

on all 3 UGT1A isoforms tested. Comparing 20 nmol/L
and 200 nmol/L panobinostat to the incubations without
panobinostat, the CLint increases were all insignificant (p
> 0.05).

demonstrating the UGT isoforms that are responsible for
the glucuronidation of panobinostat. As such, we decided
to study the isoforms (UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and UGT1A7)
involved in SN-38 glucuronidation and investigate
whether panobinostat inhibits any of these isoforms.
In our present work, the results obtained suggested that
there is no glucuronidation-mediated DDI between
panobinostat and irinotecan via UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and
UGT1A7. Hence, there should be no drug interaction
problems when administering intravenous irinotecan with
oral or intravenous panobinostat. Therefore, irinotecan
and panobinostat can be used safely as a combination
therapy in a clinical setting, and formulation scientists can
formulate such combination products in the future.
Most importantly, it was stated and shown earlier
in our findings that genetic polymorphic expression
of UGT1A1 can cause inter-individual variability in
irinotecan pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [3].
Critically, the DDI between irinotecan and belinostat
was found to be worsened to the same extent for both the
UGT1A1*28 heterozygous and homozygous genotypes,
highlighting the potential clinical significance as a larger
proportion of patients with heterozygous genotype may
have the same risk of developing severe toxicity as those
of the homozygous genotype. It is noteworthy that the
Caucasian population is particularly at risk, as 11.5% are
UGT1A1*28 homozygotes and 51.4% are heterozygotes,
increasing the total population at risk of severe toxicity
to 66.9% [36]. Also in Asians, the Indian population is
most at risk, as 1.7% are UGT1A1*28 homozygotes and
25% are heterozygotes, bringing more than a quarter of the
population (26.7%) to a risk of severe toxicity [37].
Currently, individualised treatment of irinotecan
can be tailored for patients who have been genotyped
with the UGT1A1*28 allele, which predisposes them to
higher risks of neutropenia [36]. However, it has also
been shown that UGT1A1*28 is associated with reduced
belinostat glucuronidation, which suggests that patients
with this genotype may potentially have higher exposure
to active belinostat resulting from impaired clearance of
belinostat [17, 18, 28]. This has serious implications, as
a higher concentration of belinostat due to the UGT1A1
mutation will result in a much stronger inhibition of
SN-38 glucuronidation, thereby causing severe toxicity
accordingly. Internationally, this polymorphism is also
more common in Caucasians and Africans than Asians,
with an allelic frequency of about 3-fold or more in
Caucasian and African counterparts [38]. Thus, this
suggests a greater risk of severe toxicity if combination
therapy containing irinotecan and belinostat is given to
patients harbouring the commonest genetic variant of
UGT1A1.
Therefore, irinotecan and belinostat should be
administered together with caution, and our results need
careful evaluation in human interaction studies. As the
results of our study could be clinical significant due

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report describing
glucuronidation-mediated drug interaction of irinotecan
with hydroxamate HDACis. In order to determine the
concentration of SN38 and SN38G, a sensitive and robust
LC-MS/MS method has been successfully developed
and validated according to the FDA guidelines [33].
Excellent linearity was achieved with good precisions and
accuracies for SN38 and SN38G. We have demonstrated
that belinostat inhibits UGT1A1 non-competitively in a
dose-dependent manner by decreasing the glucuronidation
of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. However,
this was not the case for vorinostat and panobinostat. This
is consistent with other studies, which showed that SN-38
and belinostat are primarily deactivated by UGT1A1 [15,
28]. UGT1A1 has also been reported to have more than 1
binding site, and there are several known non-competitive
inhibitors of UGTs enzymes, such as phenylbutazone and
quinine [34]. However, the molecular basis of belinostat’s
non-competitive inhibition is unknown.
There has been interest in developing combination
therapy with irinotecan and HDACis like vorinostat [35].
Notably, our results suggested that taking belinostat
orally (simulated by its concentration at 10 μmol/L)
with irinotecan would not have significant interactions,
whereas using a high-dose intravenous belinostat infusion
(simulated by its concentration at 200 μmol/L) with
irinotecan could pose severe DDI problems. The data
suggested that both drugs should not be simultaneously
administered together via intravenous infusion. If this
combination is needed, human interaction studies should
be performed to establish the safety of doses administered.
Furthermore, our novel findings can be useful for
formulation scientists as they may design combination of
anti-cancer products in the future to combat drug-resistant
cancers. Our results suggest that irinotecan and belinostat
should not be combined and formulated together for use
due to their potential DDI, which may cause SN-38 driven
toxicity. This finding would be of importance, especially
since belinostat was FDA approved in 2014 [31].
Using recombinant UGT1A9, we observed that
SN-38G formation was not reduced by vorinostat at its
therapeutic concentration of 2 μmol/L, when given orally
[32]. Clinically, our results suggested that there should
be no drug interaction problem when administering oral
vorinostat with intravenous irinotecan. In the future,
formulation scientists could combine these 2 drugs in a
formulation if it is shown that they have increased efficacy
in treating cancer.
Currently, there have not been any studies

to the high frequency of genetic variants of UGT1A1,
we strongly believe that further investigations into the
potential inhibition of other drugs including new substrates
and inhibitors of UGT1A1 on irinotecan metabolism
are warranted due to their severe adverse effects in
combination therapies.

Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes.
To ensure clinical relevance, the Cmax of SN-38 in clinical
trials falls within the range being studied [40]. Also,
belinostat at 10 µmol/L, 100 µmol/L and 200 µmol/L were
chosen as they represented the Cmax of oral, low-dose and
high-dose intravenous administration respectively [4143]. Appropriate control reactions were also conducted
with UGT control as the microsomal protein in a similar
fashion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and reagents

Incubations of SN-38 with vorinostat

SN-38, SN-38G and their internal standards, SN38-d3 and SN-38G-d3 respectively, were obtained from
Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, ON, Canada).
Belinostat, vorinostat and panobinostat, were purchased
from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). Human
recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A1,
UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A9), UGT control, UGT
reaction mix - solutions A and B, HLMs (50 donor pool,
UGT1A1*1*28 and UGT1A1*28*28 allelic variants)
were purchased from BD Gentest (San Jose, CA, USA).
All other reagents were of HPLC grade or of the highest
grade commercially available.

SN-38 was incubated in the presence of vorinostat
(0 and 2 µmol/L) and UGT1A9 (0.5 mg/mL). Vorinostat
2 µmol/L was chosen as it represented the Cmax following
oral administration. UGT1A9 was chosen since
vorinostat and SN-38 share this similar minor metabolic
pathway[29].

Incubations of SN-38 with panobinostat
SN-38 was incubated in the presence of panobinostat
(0, 20 and 200 nmol/L) and various enzymes in the
UGT1A family (UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A7 at 0.5 mg/
mL). Panobinostat at 20 nmol/L and 200 nmol/L were
chosen as they represented the Cmax following oral and
intravenous administration respectively [44]. UGT1A1,
UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 were chosen since these UGTs
could be responsible for glucuronidating panobinostat
[45].

Liquid
chromatography-tandem
mass
spectrometry analysis of SN-38 and SN-38G
The protein precipitation with acetonitrile was
adopted for sample preparation for determination of SN38 and SN-38G, similar toa previously described method
in which methanol was used as a a protein precipitating
agent [39]. Ten microliter aliquots were injected into a
high-performance liquid chromatograph assay system
(Agilent 1100, Germany) with tandem mass spectrometric
detection (API 4000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer;
AB Sciex, Concord, Canada). Baseline separation of the
analytes was achieved on the Alltima C18 (150 mm x 2.1
mm, 5 μm) column. The mobile phase A and B consisted
of 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid, respectively.
Gradient elution was done for 5 minutes at the flow rate of
0.4 mL/min using the following stepwise gradient: 0 to 0.1
minutes, 84% A and 16% B; 0.1 to 1.6 minutes, 16% A and
64% B; and 1.6 to 5 minutes, back to 84% A and 16% B.

Data analysis
All experiments were carried out in triplicate. SN38G formation velocity (ν) was calculated as Cm, 30 min/
incubation time/microsomal protein concentration, where
Cm, 30 min was the metabolite concentration after 30 min
incubation. Plots of substrate concentration, S (X axis)
versus ν (Y axis) were then constructed. Km and Vmax were
calculated by the Michaelis-Menten Equation 1 below
using GraphPad software v5.01 (GraphPad Software,
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The kinetic parameter Vmax/
Km, which is equivalent to intrinsic clearance (CLint)
(Equation 2), was derived from the slope of the plot of the
rate of product formation versus substrate concentration.
Comparisons of CLint between two groups were performed
by a paired t-test. Data were considered statistically
significant when p < 0.05.
ν = [S] x Vmax/([S] + Km)		
Equation 1
CLint = Vmax/Km	
		
Equation 2

Incubations of SN-38 with belinostat
The incubation mixture (50 µL) consisted of SN-38
(80 - 16000 nmol/L), belinostat at different concentrations
(0, 10, 100 and 200 µmol/L), MgCl2 (8 mmol/L), TrisHCl buffer at pH 7.4 (50 mmol/L), alamethicin in dH2O
(0.025 mg/mL) and UDPGA (5 mmol/L) in Eppendorf
tubes. After pre-incubation, the reaction was started with
the addition of UGT1A1 or pooled HLMs (0.5 mg/mL).
