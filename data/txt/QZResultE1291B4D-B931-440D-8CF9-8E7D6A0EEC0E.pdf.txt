ABSTRACT:
Increased activation of ERK signaling has been reported in breast cancer models
of acquired tamoxifen resistance. Here, we examined the expression of MitogenActivated Protein Kinase Phosphatases (MKPs) 1 and 2 following tamoxifen treatment
and the effects of MKP-1/MKP-2 overexpression on tamoxifen sensitivity. Treatment
of MCF7 breast cancer cells with tamoxifen increased MKP-2, but not MKP-1, protein
levels. Overexpression of MKP-1 or MKP-2 inhibited estrogen-induced MCF7 cell
proliferation compared to vector controls. MCF7-MKP-2 cells displayed significantly
increased sensitivity to tamoxifen as compared to vector control or MCF7-MKP-1 cells.
MKP-1 or MKP-2 overexpression eliminated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that
decreases in estrogen-induced proliferation of MKP-1 and MKP-2 overexpressing cells
are due to ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. JNK1/2 activation was not detectable in any
of these cells. These data suggest that tamoxifen-induced death of these cells is not
dependent upon JNK signaling, but rather that ERK is the major MAPK driving their
proliferation. MCF7-TAMR cells express higher levels of MKP-2 mRNA and protein
than MCF7 cells. MKP-2 and phospho-ERK1/2 proteins are constitutively expressed
in MCF7-TAMR cells, and activated JNK1/2 is not detectable. These data suggest that
MKP-2 rather than MKP-1 is tamoxifen-regulated and that the elevated expression
of MKP-2 in MCF7-TAMR cells potentially functions to restore tamoxifen sensitivity.

INTRODUCTION

that is resistant to tamoxifen treatment. There are many
proposed mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance, including,
but not limited to, ligand-independent activation of the
estrogen receptor [1] and tamoxifen acting as an agonist
via crosstalk with other transcription factors [5]. Both of
these resistance mechanisms have been connected to the
activity of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK),
one of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs)
[1, 5]. The MAPK family consists of three branches: ERK,
JNK and p38. The activity of these kinases is stimulated
by growth signals (ERK, JNK, and p38), cytokines (JNK,
p38) and cellular stress (JNK, p38) [6, 7] and they are
activated by dual threonine-tyrosine phosphorylation on

Approximately 70% of breast tumors express
estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) [1, 2]. For women who
present with ERalpha-positive tumors, first-line therapy
involves treatment with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen mimics the
binding of estrogen to the estrogen receptor and inhibits
its function. When used in an adjuvant setting, tamoxifen
reduces the chance of developing recurrent disease by 4050% [3]. Approximately 30-50% of women with metastatic
disease will experience temporary remission while being
treated with tamoxifen [3, 4]. Unfortunately, most of
these women will eventually develop recurrent disease

residues present in a TXY motif in their activation loop
[8]. ERK is known to contribute to ligand-independent
activation of ERalpha through phosphorylation of Ser118
[9]. ERK activity has also been associated with endocrine
therapy resistance and decreased survival of breast cancer
patients [4]. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK activity
in vitro has been shown to reverse the tamoxifen resistant
phenotype in breast [10] and several other cancer types
[11, 12].
Endogenously, ERK activation is inhibited
through the activity of Mitogen-activated protein kinase
phosphatases (MKPs). The MKPs are a family of eleven
dual-specificity phosphatases that attenuate MAP Kinase
activity through dephosphorylation of threonine and
tyrosine residues present in the TXY motif [6, 7]. Although
MKPs have been associated with a variety of cancer types,
upregulation of MKP-1 and MKP-2 expression has been
reported in breast cancer [13]. MKP-1 and MKP-2 are
nuclear phosphatases that dephosphorylate ERK, JNK and
p38 [14-16]. Their transcription can be induced by ERK
phosphorylation of transcription factors [17]. Although
the role of the MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer
development, progression and tamoxifen resistance is well

documented [9, 18], very little is known about the role
of MKPs in tamoxifen response and sensitivity. Here, we
characterize MKP expression in breast cell lines and show
that MKP-2 levels increase following tamoxifen treatment,
whereas MKP-1 expression is unaffected. Overexpression
of MKP-2 results in decreased estrogen-induced cell
proliferation and increased sensitivity to tamoxifen,
potentially by abrogation of ERK phosphorylation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of MKP expression in breast cell
lines
To study the regulation of MKPs and their effect on
MAPK signaling in tamoxifen sensitivity, we identified
a cell line model suitable for expression of exogenous
MKP proteins. A panel of three breast cell lines (nontumorigenic MCF10A, ER-negative MDA-MB-231
and estrogen receptor positive MCF7) was screened for
MKP expression using real-time RT-PCR and western

Figure 1: Characterization of MKP-1 and MKP-2 in breast cell lines. A- Untreated whole cell lysates of MCF10A, MDA-

MB-231, and MCF7 cells were analyzed by western blot and probed with anti-MKP-1 antibody. Actin was used as a loading control. B.
Real time PCR using MKP-1- and MKP-2-specific primers were performed to assess mRNA expression in MCF10A, MDA-MB-231 and
MCF7 cells. GAPDH was used as an internal control. C- MCF7-MKP-2 cells were transiently transfected with either the non-silencing
control (NT) or one of four MKP-2 shRNA constructs. Whole cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis with anti-MKP-1
antibody. β-Actin was used as a loading control. D- MKP-1 [GenBank:NP_004408.1] and MKP-2 [GenBank:NP 001385.1] amino acid

blot analysis. Real-time PCR analysis showed that
MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells express similar levels
of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 mRNA, whereas MCF7 cells
expressed low levels of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 mRNAs
(Figure 1A). Western blot analysis with anti-MKP-1
antibody showed the presence of MKP-1 (39 kDa) and a
43 kDa protein in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas only the
43 kDa band was seen in MCF10A cells. Trace amounts
of the 43 kDa protein were detected in MCF7 cells (Figure
1B). The estrogen-receptor positive T47D cell line showed
results similar to MCF7 cells (data not shown). To confirm

the identity of the 43 kDa band detected by the antiMKP-1 antibody, MCF7 cells engineered to overexpress
a V5-His tagged MKP-2 (48 kDa) were transiently
transfected with either a non-silencing control shRNA or
one of four MKP-2 shRNA constructs. MKP-2 shRNAs
reduced both the exogenous 48 kDa and endogenous
43 kDa bands compared to the non-silencing controls,
suggesting that the 43 kDa band detected by the MKP-1
antibody is MKP-2 (Figure 1C). ClustalW alignment of
MKP-1 and MKP-2 amino acid sequences revealed that

antibody epitope are identical (Figure 1D). These data may
explain the recognition of MKP-2 by the MKP-1 antibody.
MCF7 was chosen as the model cell line for further studies
due to the weak and undetectable levels of MKP-2 and
MKP-1, respectively.

remained sensitive to TAM treatment (Figure 2D). To
verify these data, growth responses to E2 in the presence
of increasing concentrations of TAM were determined.
Vector control, MKP-1- and MKP-2-overexpressing cells
were treated with E2 alone or a combination of E2 and 1-,
10- or 100-fold molar excess TAM. Overexpression of
MKP-2 caused a significant (p<0.05) suppression of the
E2-induced cell proliferation observed in vector control
(Figure 2D). Treatment with a combination of E2 with
1, 10 or 100-fold molar excess of TAM resulted in dose
dependent inhibition of MCF7-MKP-1-Pool and MCF7MKP-2-Pool cell proliferation similar to vector control
cells. However, compared to vector control and MKP-1
overexpressing cells, MKP-2 overexpression conferred
greater TAM sensitivity, as significant (p<0.01) decreases
in cell proliferation were observed at all three doses of
TAM.

MKP-2, but not MKP-1 expression increases
following tamoxifen treatment
To determine the effect of tamoxifen on MKP1 protein expression, single clones of cells expressing
empty vector or MKP-1 (MCF7-MKP-1) were cultured
in phenol-red free medium supplemented with charcoalstripped FBS overnight and then treated for twenty-four
hours with either 1 or 10 nM E2, 100 nM or 1000 nM TAM
or the combination of E2 and 100-fold molar excess TAM.
Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates showed no
detectable changes in levels of exogenous MKP-1 protein
expression and endogenous MKP-1 remained undetectable
(Figure 2A). However, treatment with TAM increased
MKP-2 protein levels in both MCF7 vector control and
MCF7-MKP-1 cells (Figure 2A).

Overexpression of MKP-1 and MKP-2 abrogates
ERK activity in MCF7 cells
The decrease in proliferation of MCF7-MKP1-Pool or MCF7-MKP-2-Pool cells in response to E2
treatment, as well as the increase in MKP-2 expression
following TAM treatment (Figure 2A) suggests that these
MKPs impact the activities of MAPKs that drive the
proliferation of these cells. To determine which of the
MAPKs are dephosphorylated by MKP-1 and MKP-2,
western blot analysis of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 (two MAPK
family members associated with cell proliferation) was
performed. Vector control, MCF7-MKP-1-Pool and
MCF7-MKP-2-Pool cells were depleted of E2 and then
treated with E2, TAM, ICI or combinations of E2+TAM
or E2+ICI. Phospho-ERK1/2 levels were increased
in response to E2, but returned to basal levels upon the
addition of TAM (Figure 3A). Overexpression of MKP1 or MKP-2 completely abolished ERK1/2 activation
regardless of treatment condition (Figure 3A). These
results confirm the biological activity of the exogenously
expressed MKP-1 and MKP-2 and suggest that the
decreases in E2-induced proliferation of MKP-1 and
MKP-2 overexpressing cells compared to vector control
cells are likely due to ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. JNK1/2
activation was not detectable in vector control, MCF7MKP-1-Pool or MCF7-MKP-2-Pool cells. These data
further suggest that TAM-induced cell death of these cells
is not dependent on JNK signaling, but rather that ERK is
the major MAPK driving their proliferation.

MKP-1 and MKP-2 overexpression do not alter
tamoxifen sensitivity
To better reflect the heterogeneity present in a
tumor, stable clones of MCF7 cells transfected with empty
pCDNA3.1, pCDNA3.1-MKP-1 or pCDNA3.1-MKP-2
were pooled. Expression of exogenous MKP-1 and MKP2 were verified by western blot with anti-V5 antibody.
Bands corresponding to 44 and 48 kDa, representative
of V5-tagged MKP-1 and MKP-2, respectively, were
detected (Figure 2B). Whole cell lysates of MCF7pCDNA3.1-Pool and MCF7-MKP-2-Pool cells were
analyzed by western blot following treatment with E2,
TAM, ICI or the combination of E2+TAM or E2+ICI
(Figure 2C). Low levels of endogenous MKP-2 protein
were detected following TAM treatment in both MCF7pCDNA3.1-Pool and MCF7-MKP-2-Pool cells.
To assess the effect of MKP-1 overexpression
on MCF7 cell proliferation in response to estrogen or
tamoxifen treatment, MCF7-MKP-1-Pool cells were
treated with E2, TAM or a combination of E2 and 100fold molar excess TAM. Compared to vector control cells
that responded to E2 treatment with a two-fold increase
in cell proliferation, MCF7-MKP-1-Pool cell proliferation
was unaffected by E2. However, MCF7-MKP-1-Pool
cells exhibited similar levels of TAM sensitivity as
vector control cells (Figure 2D). Taken together, these
results suggest that MKP-1 overexpression does not
contribute to alterations in TAM sensitivity but diminishes
stimulation by estrogen. Analyses of vector control and
MKP-2 overexpressing MCF7 cells showed similar data
as MCF7-MKP-1-Pool cells. MCF7-MKP-2-Pool cells

conditions using an isogenic model of acquired tamoxifen
resistance (MCF7 and MCF7-TAMR cells). Compared
to MCF7 cells, a 12-fold increase in MKP-2 mRNA
expression was observed in MCF7-TAM-R cells, whereas
MKP-1 expression was negligible as in MCF7 parental
cells (Figure 4A). Western blot analysis verified real-time
RT-PCR data, as a 3.5-fold increase in the level of MKP-2
was detected in MCF7-TAMR cells (Figure 4A).
Whole cell lysates of parental MCF7 cells treated
with E2, TAM, ICI or the combination of E2+TAM or
E2+ICI were analyzed by western blot for MKP-1, MKP2, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 levels (Figure 4B). Low levels
of MKP-2 protein were detectable following treatment
with anti-estrogens in MCF7 cells. ERK1/2 activation
was detected following E2 treatment and returned to
basal levels upon the addition of TAM. JNK activation
was not detected. Analysis of MKP-2 regulation in

MCF7-TAMR cells following treatment with E2, TAM,
ICI or combinations of E2+TAM or E2+ICI showed
that MKP-2 levels were unaffected by treatments and
MKP-1 expression remained undetectable (Figure 4C).
Consistent with reported data [19], ERK1/2 remained
active regardless of treatment condition (Figure 4C). As
with MKP-1 or MKP-2 overexpressing cells (Figure 3),
JNK activation was not detected in the MCF7-TAMR cells
(Figure 4C). These data corroborate the data from Figures
2 and 3 and suggest that MKP-2 expression is upregulated
by tamoxifen treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
MAP Kinase Phosphatases are key components of
MAPK signaling and regulation. Previous studies have
reported a link between MKPs and therapy resistance in

Figure 5: Proposed model of MKP-2 regulation in tamoxifen sensitive vs. tamoxifen resistant cells. In tamoxifen sensitive cells,

low levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 are present, indicating that cell-growth signaling pathways are activated. Following treatment with
TAM, MKP-2 protein expression is increased with resultant dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and slowing or elimination of cell proliferation.
In tamoxifen resistant cells, phosphorylated ERK1/2 is constitutively present at higher levels than in tamoxifen sensitive cells. MKP-2
protein expression is upregulated in an attempt to return phospho-ERK1/2 levels to that of a tamoxifen sensitive cell. The levels of active
ERK may be too high for MKP-2 to completely dephosphorylate ERK1/2, resulting in continued cell survival. Additionally, previous work
in our lab has shown that active ERK is able to phosphorylate MKP-2, leading to its stabilization, which might be an additional factor in
the higher protein levels seen in tamoxifen resistant cells compared to tamoxifen sensitive cells.

breast and a variety of other cancers [7, 20]. However, the
role of MKPs in tamoxifen response has not been studied.
We show here that treatment with TAM stimulates the
expression of MKP-2, but does not have the same effect
on MKP-1. Similar analysis of MCF7-TAMR cells showed
constitutive expression of MKP-2, but no detectable levels
of MKP-1. Overexpressing MKP-1 or MKP-2 decreased
the ability of MCF7 cells to proliferate in the presence
of E2, TAM or their combination due to abrogation
of ERK1/2 activation rather than JNK1/2 activation.
These results also indicate that when expressed above
physiological levels, the substrate specificity of MKP1 (ERK<<JNK, p38) is lost. MCF7-TAMR cells, which
have high levels of activated ERK, exhibited a constitutive
level of MKP-2 expression. Taken together, these results
suggest that MKP-2 mediated ERK inactivation sensitizes
breast cancer cells to TAM treatment. We posit that MKP2 expression is upregulated in TAM resistant cells to
potentially help return cells to a TAM sensitive state. In
our proposed model (Figure 5), in TAM sensitive cells,
which are dependent on E2 signaling for survival, MKP2 is upregulated following TAM treatment to inactivate
ERK, which results in slowing of cell proliferation and
subsequent cell death. In TAM resistant cells, which are
not sensitive to E2, ERK activation is present at higher
levels than in TAM sensitive cells. This activation is
mediated by increased growth factor signaling, which
is known to occur in TAM resistant tumors [21, 22].
Although these cells show higher levels of MKP-2 gene
expression, the levels of phospho-ERK1/2 in these cells
are probably too high for MKP-2 to completely eliminate
its activity. Previous work in our lab has shown that
activated ERK can stabilize MKP-2 by phosphorylating
MKP-2 on Ser386 and Ser391 [23]. Since ERK activity
is higher in TAM resistant cells, its ability to potentially
modify MKP-2 post-translationally might contribute to
the higher levels of MKP-2 protein in these cells. Thus,
despite the constant presence of MKP-2 in TAM resistant
cells, it is unable to halt ERK-mediated proliferation
rendering the drug ineffective.
The relationship between cell signaling pathways
and the endogenous molecules that attenuate their activity
is important and often understudied in the context of
cancer treatment. While increasing the expression/activity
of MKP-2 to sensitize cells to tamoxifen therapy is not
a viable therapeutic strategy at this time, our results
support the importance of continuing to develop clinically
effective ways to reduce ERK activity in breast cancer
cells. The idea that MKP-2 plays a role in chemotherapy
response is also supported by a recent study by Balko et
al [24], in which molecular profiling of basal-like breast
cancer tissues revealed that loss of MKP-2 expression
was associated with increased ERK pathway activation
and reduced disease-free survival following neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy. The authors also suggested that MKP-2
expression could be used as a biomarker for MEK inhibitor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sensitivity in these patients [24]. In light of these results,
MKP-2 might also be useful as a marker for sensitivity in
tumors that are candidates for TAM treatment. However,
further development of antibodies and reagents that can
selectively differentiate the expression and activities of
MKP-2 from MKP-1 are necessary for this strategy to be
effective. The connection between TAM treatment, MKP2 activation and inhibition of ERK activity in these cells
also needs to be investigated further to determine how best
to translate these findings into clinical benefit.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Culture Conditions
MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)[25]. MCF10A cells were
grown in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with
5% FBS, 10 µg/mL insulin, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth
factor, 100 ng/mL cholera enterotoxin and 0.5 µg/mL
hydrocortisone [25]. MCF7 cells were maintained in
DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 5% FBS,
10 µg/mL insulin and 0.5 nM 17-beta-estradiol [26].
Tamoxifen resistant MCF7 cells (MCF7-TAMR) were
generated by gradual exposure to increasing concentrations
of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (TAM) over a period of six
months. MCF7-TAMR cells are able to tolerate exposure
to 10 µM TAM. MCF7-TAMR cells were routinely
maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with
5% FBS, 10 µg/mL insulin and 1 µM TAM (Gerard and
Shekhar, manuscript in preparation). MCF7 cells stably
expressing empty vector (pEGFP or pCDNA3.1), MKP-1
[27] or MKP-2 [23] were maintained in the same medium
as MCF7 cells and stable clones were selected with 500
µg/mL G418. All cell lines were maintained in a 37°C
incubator with a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5%
CO2. For experiments involving treatment with 17-betaestradiol (E2), tamoxifen (TAM) or ICI 182,780 (ICI),
cells were depleted of endogenous hormones by culturing
in phenol red free media supplemented with charcoalstripped FBS and 10 µg/mL insulin.

Generation of MKP-1 and MKP-2 Overexpressing
Cell Lines
Pooled populations of MCF7 cells overexpressing
full-length human MKP-1, MKP-2, or the empty

(Biontex). Stable clones expressing V5-His tagged MKP-1
or MKP-2 were selected with G418 antibiotic (500 µg/mL)
and pooled to minimize clonal bias. Stable pools of MCF7
cells expressing empty vector, MKP-1 or MKP-2 were

analysis of MKP-1, MKP-2, phospho-ERK1/2, total
ERK1/2, phospho-JNK1/2, JNK1/2, actin and GAPDH.
Proteins were detected either with the Amersham ECL
Plus Reagent(GE Healthcare) or by Odyssey Infrared
imaging.

MTT Assay
MCF7-pCDNA3.1-Pool, MCF7-MKP-1-Pool or
MCF7-MKP-2-Pool cells (1x103 cells per well) were
seeded in 96 well plates (day 0) and treated with vehicle
(EtOH, 0.1% v/v), 10 nM E2, 100 or 1000 nM TAM, or a
combination of 10 nM E2 and 1-, 10- or 100-fold molar
excess TAM. Treatments were refreshed on day 4. Assays
were terminated on day 7 or when control wells reached
85% confluency, whichever was longer. Cell viability
was assessed by MTT assay (Sigma) and measured on a
Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek) with Gen5 1.10 software.

RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis and Real-Time
RT-PCR Analysis
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Life
Technologies) and cDNAs were synthesized using the
SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen)
using 5 µg total RNA and random primers. cDNA quality
and specificity of the gene-specific primers were verified
by semi-quantitative PCR using gene specific primers.
RT-PCR was carried out using the Choice-Taq DNA
polymerase (Denville) and the following conditions: 95°C
for 2 minutes, followed by thirty-five cycles of 95°C for
15 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 60 seconds
and a final 5 minute extension step at 72°C. The following
primer sequences were used for semi-quantitative and
