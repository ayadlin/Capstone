Abstract
Resistance to chemotherapy and metastases are the major causes of breast cancer-related mortality.
Moreover, cancer stem cells (CSC) play critical roles in cancer progression and treatment resistance.
Previously, it was found that CSC-like cells can be generated by aberrant activation of epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT), thereby making anti-EMT strategies a novel therapeutic option for treatment of aggressive
breast cancers. Here, we report that the transcription factor FOXC2 induced in response to multiple EMT
signaling pathways as well as elevated in stem cell-enriched factions is a critical determinant of mesenchymal
and stem cell properties, in cells induced to undergo EMT- and CSC-enriched breast cancer cell lines. More
speciﬁcally, attenuation of FOXC2 expression using lentiviral short hairpin RNA led to inhibition of the
mesenchymal phenotype and associated invasive and stem cell properties, which included reduced mammosphere-forming ability and tumor initiation. Whereas, overexpression of FOXC2 was sufﬁcient to induce CSC
properties and spontaneous metastasis in transformed human mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, a
FOXC2-induced gene expression signature was enriched in the claudin-low/basal B breast tumor subtype that
contains EMT and CSC features. Having identiﬁed PDGFR-b to be regulated by FOXC2, we show that the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration-approved PDGFR inhibitor, sunitinib, targets FOXC2-expressing tumor cells
leading to reduced CSC and metastatic properties. Thus, FOXC2 or its associated gene expression program
may provide an effective target for anti-EMT-based therapies for the treatment of claudin-low/basal B breast
tumors or other EMT-/CSC-enriched tumors. Cancer Res; 73(6); 1981–92. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Despite the initial effectiveness of conventional therapies,
recurrence and the emergence of metastases are major causes
of therapeutic failure in cancer patients. These therapies are

believed to target the differentiated and proliferative cells that
comprise the bulk of the tumor. The relatively high relapse rate
of patients with aggressive forms of breast cancer, including
the recently identiﬁed triple-negative claudin-low/basal B
subtype (for brevity referred to as claudin-low throughout),
is attributed to a small population of cancer stem cells (CSC)
residing within the tumor. In addition to resistance to
standard therapies, CSCs are reported to have inherently
greater tumor-initiating potential, which is implicated in
tumor relapse (1), driving primary tumor growth as well as
the seeding and establishment of metastases (2–7). Therefore, therapeutic approaches that speciﬁcally target the CSC
population, particularly when used in combination with
conventional therapies, may provide a therapeutic strategy
to substantially improve breast cancer patient outcome. The
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program has
recently been linked to the generation of breast CSC-like
cells (8) and has well-documented roles in promoting an
invasive and metastatic phenotype (9, 10). As such, the
development of targeted therapeutics to inhibit the EMT
program may provide signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁts in treating
aggressive breast cancers for which current therapies are
inadequate.
EMT was initially characterized as an important program
during normal embryonic development (11, 12), however,

more recent reports suggest that carcinoma cells are capable
of reactivating the EMT program during tumor progression
(9). Similar to cells that undergo EMT during normal development, carcinoma cells that undergo EMT lose cell–cell
contacts, undergo major changes in their cytoskeleton, and
acquire a mesenchymal-like morphology endowing them
with increased invasive and migratory abilities (11–13).
Several signaling molecules present in the tumor microenvironment are capable of initiating EMT and metastasis (14,
15) and importantly, many of these same factors have also
been found to be aberrantly activated and/or overexpressed
in human cancers (16–20). Because cells undergoing EMT
are shown to possess stem cell properties (8), and several
recent studies independently showed that CSCs as well as
cells that have undergone EMT are relatively resistant to
conventional chemotherapies and radiotherapies (1, 21–26),
suggests the EMT program may provide a novel therapeutic
window for inhibiting CSCs. However, because of the plethora of factors capable of inducing EMT and the hierarchy
of the EMT programs, we sought to identify a central
functional mediator of EMT independent of the initiating
signal that may provide a novel target for anti-EMT-based
therapies. Here we report that FOXC2 serves as such a
mediator. We show that it is induced by multiple factors
and that the expression of PDGFR-b is dependent on the
expression of FOXC2, and thus serves as a potential therapeutic target for cells that have undergone EMT.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and antibodies
Immortalized human mammary epithelial (HMLE) cells and
V12H-Ras transformed derivatives (HMLER), including cells
expressing empty vector (pWZL), Snail, Twist, Goosecoid, or an
activated form of TGF-b1 were maintained as previously
described (8). Established human breast cancer cell lines were
cultured in cell-speciﬁc medium as outlined in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. Antibodies used included:
anti-b-actin (Abcam), FOXC2 (Dr. Naoyuki Miura), E-cadherin
(BD Biosciences), Fibronectin (BD Biosciences), N-cadherin
(BD Biosciences), Vimentin (NeoMarkers), and b-catenin (BD
Biosciences).
Plasmids and viral transduction
The production of lentiviruses and amphotrophic retroviruses, and the transduction of target cells was followed as
previously described (27). See Supplementary Materials and
Methods for brief description.
Mammosphere assay
Mammosphere assays were conducted as previously
described (8). To test effects of sunitinib on mammosphere
formation, 1,000 cells were plated in 96-well ultra-low attachment plates in 100 mL mammosphere media. At 24 and 96
hours, media was replaced with media containing 10 mmol/L
sunitinib or vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]).
Spheres were quantiﬁed after 7 days.

Three-dimensional laminin-rich extracellular matrix
on-top cultures
The three-dimensional (3D) laminin-rich extracellular
matrix (lrECM) on-top cultures were adapted from the procedures previously described (28). See Supplementary Materials and Methods for brief description.
Animal studies
Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient
(NOD/SCID) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory.
All mouse procedures were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committees of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and conducted in accordance with Institutional policies. For xenograft tumor initiation studies, the indicated number of cells
were suspended in 50 mL of Matrigel diluted 1:1 with Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium and injected into the inguinal
mammary gland of NOD/SCID mice. Tumor incidence was
monitored for 12 weeks following orthotopic injection. To
assess the spontaneous metastatic potential of cells, 2  106
HMLER–Vector and HMLER–FOXC2 cells labeled with ﬁreﬂy
luciferase were injected into the inguinal mammary gland
of NOD/SCID mice. Mice were assessed weekly for metastasis via the intraperitoneal injection of D-Luciferin (Caliper
LifeSciences) at 150 mg/kg in PBS and in vivo bioluminescence was assessed using the IVIS imaging system 200 series
(Xenogen Corporation). Once mammary gland tumors reached
1.5 cm in diameter, mice were euthanized and organs were
harvested for conﬁrmation of metastatic tumor burden via
bioluminescence.
To ascertain the effects of sunitinib on HMLER–FOXC2
tumor growth and animal survival, 1  106 ﬁreﬂy luciferaselabeled HMLER–FOXC2 cells were injected into the mammary
fat-pad of NOD/SCID mice as described above. After 24 hours,
the mice were treated 5 days a week with 40 mg/kg sunitinib or
vehicle (n ¼ 9) by oral gavage. Animal were sacriﬁced once the
tumors reached 1.5 cm3 or 30 days following injection and the
dissected organs were immediately analyzed for luciferase
activity. Details of additional procedures can be found in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
FOXC2 is required for the maintenance of the
mesenchymal phenotype following EMT induction in
human mammary epithelial cells
In our previous study, enhanced expression of FOXC2
was observed following the induction of EMT by several
factors in experimentally immortalized HMLE cells (17)
strongly suggesting that FOXC2 may be a critical determinant of multiple EMT programs. To assess the functional role of FOXC2 during EMT, we used shRNA-mediated suppression of FOXC2 in HMLE cells that underwent
EMT via ectopic expression of Snail, Twist, or TGF-b1. The
suppression of FOXC2 had no signiﬁcant effect on
cell growth, but substantially altered the in vitro morphology of all cell lines, including increased clustering of cells
into epithelial-like islands with prominent cell–cell contacts and reduced ﬁbroblastic morphology (Fig. 1A).

FOXC2 attenuation also led to reduced expression of
mesenchymal markers vimentin, ﬁbronectin, and N-cadherin across all cell types tested as well as re-expression
(both mRNA and protein levels) of the epithelial marker Ecadherin in HMLE–Snail and HMLE–TGF-b1 cells (Fig. 1B
and C). To examine whether FOXC2 could function in
parallel to other EMT regulators we examined the expression of Snail, Twist, and Slug in cells ectopically expressing
FOXC2 and found only moderate upregulation of Twist
but not Snail or Slug expression (Supplementary Fig. S1),
suggesting FOXC2 may not regulate expression of these
factors.
The passage of cells through an EMT and the acquisition
of mesenchymal properties is associated with increased
migratory and invasive properties. Suppression of FOXC2
was observed to signiﬁcantly inhibit the invasion of
HMLE–Snail cells through matrigel using Transwell migration assays in response to the soluble chemotactic ligands
basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet-derived
growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB; Fig. 1D). Mammary cells
possessing epithelial traits are known to form organized
multicellular acini structures with an intact laminin positive basement membrane in 3D lrECM cultures (29, 30).
However, following the induction of EMT, cells became
disorganized and gained invasive properties characterized
by disrupted laminin staining (31, 32). Using 3D lrECM
assays, HMLE–Snail control-shRNA cells grew as highly
invasive stellate structures with disrupted basement membrane, displayed by disorganized laminin V staining (Fig.
1E). In contrast, the HMLE–Snail FOXC2-shRNA cells
formed noninvasive, multicellular structures with an intact
basement membrane as depicted by a continuous laminin
V layer (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results suggest that
FOXC2 is necessary for the maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype of mammary epithelial cells following passage through EMT.
FOXC2 is necessary for the stem cell-like properties
generated via EMT in mammary epithelial cells
We previously reported that HMLE–Snail, HMLE–Twist,
and HMLE–TGF-b1 cells acquired properties similar
to breast CSCs, including the CD44high/CD24low cell surface
markers and an increased ability to form mammospheres (8).
Here, we found that the attenuation of FOXC2 expression by
shRNA in these cells reduced the number of cells with the
CD44high/CD24low phenotype compared with the controlshRNA expressing cells (Fig. 2A). In the same conditions, there
was a marked decrease in the mammosphere-forming ability
(Fig. 2B).
Next, the acquisition of stem cell properties and passage
through an EMT has been reported to increase the resistance
to chemotherapeutic agents (22, 23). In accordance with this,
we found that suppression of FOXC2 expression in cells that
have undergone EMT (HMLE–Snail, HMLE–Twist, and
HMLE–TGF-b1) sensitized them to paclitaxel (Fig. 2C).
Together, these results indicate FOXC2 expression is necessary
for EMT-derived stem cell-like properties in mammary epithelial cells.

FOXC2 is elevated in CSC-enriched populations and is
sufﬁcient to promote the generation of CSCs and
metastatic competence in transformed human
mammary epithelial cells
Previously it has been shown that ﬂuorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) isolation of breast tumor cells with the
CD44high/CD24low cell surface phenotype (3) as well as isolation of tumor cells from mammospheres (33) can enrich
for populations of tumor-initiating CSCs. Using this rationale,
we FACS isolated CD44high/CD24low and CD44low/CD24high
cellular fractions from HMLER and SUM159 breast cancer
cell lines and observed increased FOXC2 protein expression
in the CD44high/CD24low stem cell fraction relative to the
CD44low/CD24high fraction (Fig. 3A). Increased FOXC2 protein
expression was also observed in primary mammospheres
isolated from HMLER, SUM159, HCC38, and SUM149 cells
as compared with the same cells grown in monolayer cultures
(Fig. 3B).
Previously, we have reported that ectopic expression of
FOXC2 induced partial EMT in Madin–Darby canine kidney
epithelial cells and was sufﬁcient to promote the metastasis
of EpRas murine mammary carcinoma cells (17). However,
whether FOXC2 expression alone can induce EMT and
generate CSC-like properties remains unknown. We report
here for the ﬁrst time that ectopic expression of FOXC2 in
HMLER cells is sufﬁcient to induce a robust EMT and
subsequent CSC-like properties, both in vitro and in vivo.
This was displayed as a characteristic switch of morphology
to a ﬁbroblastic appearance with a reduction in epithelialspeciﬁc E-cadherin, in conjunction with increased expression of mesenchymal markers vimentin, ﬁbronectin, and
N-cadherin at the mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary
Fig. 2A–2C). Furthermore, HMLER–FOXC2 cells had
increased CSC-like properties, including a switch to the
CD44high/CD24low cell surface phenotype (Fig. 3C), enhanced
mammosphere-forming efﬁciency (Fig. 3D), and increased
resistance to paclitaxel (Fig. 3E). Notably, overexpression
of FOXC2 led to increased tumor formation of HMLER cells
in the mammary fat-pad (Fig. 3F). In fact, as few as 1  103
HMLER–FOXC2 cells could robustly initiate tumors (7/8
sites), whereas at least 2  106 HMLER–Vector control cells
were required to get a 54% tumor take rate (7/13 sites)
within the same 12 week time frame (Fig. 3F).
To assess the effect of FOXC2 expression on the orthotopic
growth and spontaneous metastasis of HMLER cells, we
injected 2  106 luciferase-labeled HMLER–FOXC2 or
HMLER–Vector cells into the mammary fat-pad of NOD/SCID
mice and analyzed for metastases using bioluminescent imaging once per week until the tumors either reached a volume of
1.5 cm3 (28 days for HMLER–FOXC2) or until the end of the
experiment after 12 weeks (HMLER–Vector). FOXC2 expression promoted aggressive growth (Fig. 3G) and metastasis of
HMLER cells to the lungs, liver, hind leg bone, and most
strikingly, to the brain (Fig. 3H) as soon as 28 days postinjection. In contrast, HMLER–Vector cells did not metastasize to
any of the organs examined (Fig. 3H) even at the end of the
experiment (data not shown). Collectively, these ﬁndings
suggest that FOXC2 expression is sufﬁcient to promote EMT

A FOXC2-associated gene expression signature is
enriched in claudin-low human breast tumors
We next investigated whether FOXC2 activity could be
observed in metastatic tumors in vivo. As a measure of
FOXC2 activity, we generated, using microarray data, a
FOXC2 gene expression signature (GES) by comparing the
gene expression proﬁle of HMLER cells overexpressing
FOXC2 to vector-transduced counterparts. Applying this
GES to data from 2 human xenograft models, MDA-MB231 and CN34, we observed that the FOXC2 GES was
signiﬁcantly higher in metastases compared with the primary tumors in both data sets (Fig. 4A and B). Collectively,
these data indicate that the FOXC2-associated signature is
enriched in metastases relative to primary tumors.

www.aacrjournals.org

We previously reported that elevated FOXC2 expression
correlated with basal-like breast cancers (17). However, using
gene expression proﬁling, an aggressive claudin-low group has
been found within this subtype (34, 35). We found the FOXC2
GES to be signiﬁcantly enriched in claudin-low human breast
tumors (Fig. 4C), as well as in claudin-low cell lines (Fig. 4D)
compared with other subtypes. To verify this ﬁnding, we
conducted a Western blot analysis and found that all claudin-low cell lines analyzed (6/6) expressed FOXC2 at varying
degrees, although none of the other cell lines expressed signiﬁcant levels of FOXC2 (Fig. 4E).
FOXC2 is required for the mesenchymal and CSC-like
properties of claudin-low breast cancer cells
As FOXC2 expression and activity was found to be associated with claudin-low breast tumors, we tested whether FOXC2
expression was required for the mesenchymal and invasive
properties of SUM159, MDA-MB231, and HMLER–Snail cells

that have a claudin-low gene expression phenotype (35). The
suppression of FOXC2 resulted in a less ﬁbroblastic morphology with increased epithelial-like cell clustering (Fig. 5A),
decreased expression of mesenchymal markers ﬁbronectin
and N-cadherin (Fig. 5B) and re-expression of E-cadherin in

fashion, SUM159 Control-shRNA cells grew in 3D lrECM cultures with a characteristic stellate morphology (36) and
extended multicellular protrusions invading into the surrounding Matrigel (Fig. 5E). The suppression of FOXC2

resulted in a dramatic reduction in the invasive morphology
of SUM159 cells (SUM159 FOXC2-shRNA) compared with
control cells (Fig. 5E).
We next assessed the effect of FOXC2 suppression on stem
cell properties on the same 3 cell lines. Suppression of FOXC2
expression substantially reduced the percentage of cells displaying the CD44high/CD24low CSC-like cell surface proﬁle (Fig.
5F) as well as signiﬁcantly abrogating the mammosphereforming ability (Fig. 5G) as compared with the Control-shRNA
expressing cells. Given that suppression of FOXC2 expression
diminished stem cell properties in vitro, we next examined if
FOXC2 knockdown affected the tumor-initiating potential of

SUM159 as well as HMLER–Snail cells using limiting dilution
tumor-initiation assays. FOXC2-shRNA or Control-shRNA
expressing cells were introduced into the mammary fat-pad
of NOD/SCID mice, and we found that the suppression of
FOXC2 expression decreased tumor initiation frequency relative to control cells of both SUM159 and HMLER–Snail xenografts (Fig. 5H). In summary, these ﬁndings suggest FOXC2 may
be an important functional mediator of the mesenchymal and
CSC properties of claudin-low breast cancer cells.
FOXC2 regulates PDGFR-b expression
We recently reported that cells induced to undergo EMT by
multiple factors upregulated the expression of PDGFR-b
(CD140b) (37) similar to FOXC2. Thus, we hypothesized that
PDGFR-b might provide a druggable downstream target in
FOXC2 expressing cells. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that PDGFR-b
protein expression was upregulated in a panel of EMT-derived
cells (Figure 6A(i) and A(ii)). As observed for FOXC2 (Fig. 3A
and B), the expression of PDGFR-b was elevated in the stem
cell-enriched CD44high/CD24low subpopulation of HMLER cells

www.aacrjournals.org

as well as in SUM159 cells cultured as mammospheres, compared with controls (Figure 6A(iii) and A(iv)). Furthermore, the
expression pattern of PDGFR-b and FOXC2 correlated strongly
across a panel of established cell lines with increased expression observed in claudin-low cell lines SUM159 and Hs578T
(Fig. 6B). Reﬂecting the increased levels of PDGFR-b in EMTderived and claudin-low cell lines, the addition of the ligand
PDGF-BB signiﬁcantly elevated Transwell cell migration in all
cells tested (Fig. 6C) and led to the further enhancement of the
invasive phenotype of HMLER–FOXC2 cells in 3D lrECM
cultures (Fig. 6D).
We next investigated if PDGFR-b expression is dependent on
FOXC2 expression. Across a panel of cells, the expression of
PDGFR-b was found to be substantially decreased upon suppression of FOXC2 (Fig. 6E and F; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Consequently, the suppression of FOXC2 in HMLE–Snail,
HMLE–TGF-b1, HMLER–Snail, and SUM159 cells compromised the ability of these cells to migrate toward PDGF-BB
(Fig. 6G). To examine the possibility of FOXC2 directly regulating PDGFR-b transcription, we conducted a chromatin

Sunitinib treatment was found to speciﬁcally inhibit the

was found to signiﬁcantly decrease mammosphere formation by >8-fold and >20-fold, respectively (Fig. 7B), as

To investigate whether sunitinib could inhibit FOXC2expressing tumors in vivo, we orally administered sunitinib to
mice following orthotopic injection of luciferase-labeled
HMLER–FOXC2 cells into the mammary fat-pad. In accordance with our in vitro observations, sunitinib treatment
reduced primary tumor growth (Fig. 7C) and extended
event-free survival of mice carrying FOXC2 tumors compared
with vehicle-treated control mice (Fig. 7D). We also analyzed
the lungs (Fig. 7E) and brain (Fig. 7F) of sunitinib-treated mice
for the presence of HMLER–FOXC2 metastases and found that
the sunitinib-treated group had signiﬁcantly reduced

as evidenced by signiﬁcantly lower photon counts in these
organs following dissection (Fig. 7E and F). Taken together,
these results indicate FOXC2-expressing tumor cells are sensitive to PDGFR-targeted therapies and suggest sunitinib may
be an effective means of targeting FOXC2-expressing cell
populations, which may include EMT-derived CSC-like and
metastatic phenotypes.

Discussion
Many recent studies support the emerging dogma that
CSCs are responsible for chemotherapy resistance, tumor
relapse, and metastatic competence (reviewed in ref. 38).
We and others have shown that CSCs and cells that have
undergone EMT share many functional and molecular
traits, with the corollary that engagement of the EMT
program within a tumor may lead to the de novo generation
and/or expansion of CSCs (8, 39). Moreover, it suggests that
perturbing or targeting EMT signaling pathways may pro-

vide an effective therapeutic strategy to deplete the EMT/
CSC populations within a tumor. Although this seems like a
rational approach, the sheer number and diversity of EMTinducing stimuli that elicit EMT in different tumor contexts
will likely hinder the development of universally applicable
therapeutics. On the basis of the increased expression of
FOXC2 following experimental induction of EMT by numerous EMT-inducing factors as well as in stem cell-enriched
fractions (CD44high/CD24low population and mammospheres), we hypothesized that FOXC2 lies at the crossroads
of EMT and stem cell properties. Indeed, we found that
FOXC2 expression is critical for stem cell properties, including resistance to chemotherapeutics and tumor initiation,
using multiple EMT models and claudin-low breast cancer
cell lines. These data clearly show that targeting FOXC2
and the associated pathways may provide an additional
strategy for diminishing the CSC pool or at least those that
arose via EMT.
It was surprising to see re-expression of E-cadherin in the
FOXC2-depleted HMLE–Snail or TGF-b1 cells but not in Twist

cells even though both Snail and Twist are continuously
expressed from a retroviral expression vector and known to
function similarly. Although these data does not explain the
failure of Snail to suppress E-cadherin expression in the
absence of FOXC2, we speculate that this could be mostly due
to differences in epigenetic alterations.
Claudin-low tumors account for between 25% and 39% of
triple-negative breast cancers (ER/PR/HER2), have been
shown to resemble most closely with mammary epithelial stem
cells; and are also enriched for markers of EMT and CSCs
(35, 40). The enrichment of FOXC2 expression and its associated GES in claudin-low tumors (1, 21, 34, 35) provides the ﬁrst
evidence that FOXC2 transcriptional activity may play an
important functional role for this molecular subtype.
We speculate that targeting the FOXC2 pathway may be
an effective therapeutic strategy for tumors with enriched
EMT/CSC properties. Future studies to assess the protein
expression of FOXC2 pathway members in clinical specimens will be critical. As transcription factors can be difﬁcult
to directly inhibit therapeutically, a potential target for
FOXC2-expressing tumors is PDGFR-b, which has U.S. Food
and Drug Administration-approved small molecule inhibitors, such as sunitinib. However, as sunitinib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, future studies using more
speciﬁc pharmacologic inhibitors of PDGFR-b or RNAi
approaches will be required to determine if PDGFR-b is a
key functional mediator of FOXC2 in EMT-derived cells and
claudin-low tumors. Nevertheless, our results suggest that
sunitinib and other PDGFR inhibitors may be effective in
patients with claudin-low or therapy resistant tumors displaying elevated FOXC2 expression.
