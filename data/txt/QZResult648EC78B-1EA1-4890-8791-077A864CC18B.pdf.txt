Abstract
Selective kinase inhibitors have emerged as an important class of cancer therapeutics, and several such drugs
are now routinely used to treat advanced-stage disease. However, their clinical beneﬁt is typically short-lived
because of the relatively rapid acquisition of drug resistance following treatment response. Accumulating
preclinical and clinical data point to a role for a heterogeneous response to treatment within a subpopulation of
tumor cells that are intrinsically drug-resistant, such as cancer stem cells. We have previously described an
epigenetically determined reversibly drug-tolerant subpopulation of cancer cells that share some properties with
cancer stem cells. Here, we deﬁne a requirement for the previously established cancer stem cell marker ALDH
(aldehyde dehydrogenase) in the maintenance of this drug-tolerant subpopulation. We ﬁnd that ALDH protects
the drug-tolerant subpopulation from the potentially toxic effects of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in these cells, and pharmacologic disruption of ALDH activity leads to accumulation of ROS to toxic levels,
consequent DNA damage, and apoptosis speciﬁcally within the drug-tolerant subpopulation. Combining ALDH
inhibition with other kinase-directed treatments delayed treatment relapse in vitro and in vivo, revealing a novel
combination treatment strategy for cancers that might otherwise rapidly relapse following single-agent therapy.

Introduction
Targeted cancer therapies that exploit the "oncogene addiction" phenomenon observed in many tumor cells can be highly
effective in the clinic (1–3). However, responding tumors
invariably recur due to acquired drug resistance, probably
reﬂecting the outgrowth of a subpopulation of treatmentrefractory cells. The maintenance of many cancers seems to
require a subpopulation of tumor cells called cancer stem cells
(CSC; ref. 4), which have been identiﬁed in hematopoietic and
solid malignancies (5), and several studies have described a role
for CSCs in drug resistance (6)
Cancer cells are continuously exposed to extrinsic and
intrinsic stresses that promote increased reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and DNA damage (7–9). The consequent accumulation of mutations in CSCs may render them more vulnerable to stress, especially as they enter S-phase. The activation of DNA damage response (DDR; refs. 10, 11), increased

expression of antiapoptotic genes (12), activation of the b-catenin pathway observed in leukemic stem cells (13), and Notch
and hedgehog pathways in prostate cancer cells (14) are some
of the mechanisms reported to underlie drug resistance in
CSCs.
CSCs express various markers, including CD44, CD133, and
ALDH1A1, at levels substantially different from the bulk tumor
cell population, and these markers are often used to isolate and
functionally characterize CSCs. The association of CSC markers such as CD44 and CD133 with drug resistance has thus far
been largely based on studies demonstrating reduced sensitivity of CSC marker–positive cells to chemotherapeutic drugs
(15) or increased expression of these markers in treatmentresistant tumors (16, 17). There have also been functional roles
in drug resistance reported for these markers, including activation of ABC transporters and antiapoptotic genes (18, 19).
Elevated ALDH1A1 is observed in CSCs of multiple cancer
types (20). ALDH proteins controls the oxidation of aldehydes
to corresponding acids, and ALDH-mediated detoxiﬁcation of
toxic aldehyde intermediates produced in cancer cells treated
with certain chemotherapy agents has been proposed to confer
drug-resistant properties to ALDH1-positive tumor cells (21).
Here, we report that cancer cell subpopulations that tolerate
otherwise toxic drug exposures express elevated ALDH, which
is critical for their survival. Inhibition of ALDH activity effectively eradicates this drug-tolerant subpopulation, revealing a
potential beneﬁcial effect of combination therapy that includes
ALDH inhibition to delay cancer relapse.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human cancer cell lines were grown in RPMI media supplemented with sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, and the antibiotics
penicillin and streptomycin at 37 C in 5% CO2. Cell line identity
is routinely monitored by SNP-based genotyping in the Genentech cell bank facility.
The Incucyte HD imaging system (Essen BioScience) was
used to monitor cell growth in culture, as measured by
percentage of conﬂuence. This instrument captures highdeﬁnition phase contrast images of cells and uses a contrast based conﬂuence algorithm to compute monolayer
conﬂuence of each image over multiple speciﬁed time
points.
ALDH activity assays
A bodipy-labeled ALDH substrate (Aldeﬂuor Kit, Stem Cell
Technology) was used to detect ALDH activity. The substrate
was diluted in RPMI media (5 mL substrate/mL media) and
added to adherent cells. After 30 minutes of incubation, cells
were washed twice with RPMI media, and microﬂuorescence
images were captured using an IncuCyte HD system (Essen
BioScience) with a 10 objective. The quantiﬁcation of
ALDHhigh cells (5% for MKN-45) was based on 16 images
captured using the Incucyte System with a 10 objective.
Flow cytometry
The Aldeﬂuor assay was used to detect ALDH activity in
MKN-45 parental cells. ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells representing about 5% of parental cells with the highest and lowest
ALDH activity, respectively, were sorted by ﬂow cytometry.
MKN-45 cells incubated with the bodipy-labeled substrate and
DEAB, a cold competitive substrate, were compared as a
negative control.
Gene expression analysis
MKN-45 cells were plated on ten 15-cm dishes at 30  106
cells per plate, and grown until 70% conﬂuence and treated
with 1 mmol/L crizotinib every 3 days for 4 weeks until drugtolerant persisters (DTP) were established. Non–drug-treated
cells in a 15-cm dish were harvested 3 days after plating. RNA
was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy kit, and RNA was
ampliﬁed in both parental and DTP cells using the NuGen
RNA Ampliﬁcation Kit. Microarray analysis was carried out in
triplicate as previously described (22). Total RNA was isolated
from ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells using a RNeasy column
(Qiagen), and microarray-based gene expression analysis was
performed on triplicate samples.
Cell viability assays
Cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde at the end of the
assay period, and viability was determined using the nucleic
acid stain Syto60 (Life Technologies) diluted 1:5,000 in water
(23). Fluorescence was measured using a SpectraMax M5
instrument (excitation 635 nm and emission 695 nm; Molecular Device). Viability was expressed as fraction of a notreatment control.

Generation of drug-tolerant cells
MKN-45- and GTL-16–derived DTPs were generated by
treating parental cells with 1 mmol/L crizotinib for 15 to 30
days. PC-9 cells were treated with 1 mmol/L erlotinib for 6 to 9
days for DTP generation. Drug concentrations used for DTP
generation for all cell lines except GTL-16, EBC-1, and A549
cells are based on previous studies (22). The appropriate
concentration of each drug needed for DTP generation was
established on the basis of a dose–response curve (Supplementary Table S3). The 200 nmol/L concentration of disulﬁram
used for most of the cell lines was based on an analysis of
disulﬁram effects on MKN-45 and GTL-16 DTPs, where an
effective cytotoxic disulﬁram concentration was empirically
determined (Supplementary Fig. S3C). In all cases, media 
drug were changed every 3 days.
Immunoblotting
Proteins were extracted from cell pellets using NP-40 lysis
buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein
concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA protein
assay kit. Protein concentrations of samples were derived from
a standard curve with BSA. Immunoblots were performed with
equal amounts of protein for all samples. This assay generated
erroneous concentration values for MKN-45 and GTL-16 DTPs.
Therefore, immunoblots of DTP lysates were performed by
loading gels with a maximum possible sample volume, and
GAPDH levels were measured as a loading control. Proteins
were separated using SDS-PAGE and immunodetection was
performed using standard protocols. Antibodies were from
various vendors: ALDH1A1 (R&D Systems); ALDH1A2 and
ALDH8A1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); ALDH1A3, ALDH3A1,
and phospho-EGFR (Abcam); GAPDH, cleaved PARP, and
phospho-ATM/ATR substrates (Cell Signaling Technology);
GAPDH (Pierce); and phospho-gH2A.x (Millipore).
Gene knockdown studies
shRNA constructs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Lentivirus production was carried out in 293T cells as previously
described (23). For knockdown studies, GTL-16 cells were
plated in 10-cm dishes (2  106 cells per plate). Following
adherence overnight, cells were infected with lentivirus or
control virus in the presence of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich)
overnight. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were replated, and following adherence overnight, cells were treated
as described above and cell viability was assayed using the Syto
60 nucleic acid stain (LifeTechnologies).
Notably, we were unable to develop suitable transfection
and lentivirus infection conditions for MKN-45 cells. Attempts
to infect MKN-45 cells with lentiviruses, including the control
GFP shRNA virus, resulted in cell death. Attempts to transfect
MKN-45 cells with siRNAs using various transfection reagents
also failed because of the unusually poor transfection efﬁciency
of this cell line.
Quantitative PCR analysis
RNA was extracted from parental cells and DTPs using the
RNeasy kit and 1 mg RNA was reverse transcribed using the high
capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems). The amount

of amplicon was determined using the Applied Biosystems
7500 quantitative PCR system using SYBR green as the ﬂuorescence reporter and normalized to GAPDH. All samples were
analyzed in triplicate and Ct values were determined.
ROS assays
ROS measurement was performed by ﬂow cytometry. The
ROS detection reagent H2DCFH-DA (Molecular Probes) was
added to cells in growth media (ﬁnal concentration: 5 mmol/L),
and after 30 minutes at 37 C, cells were harvested. FACS
analysis was performed on 10,000 cells per sample. Parental
cells not exposed to H2DCFH-DA served as negative control.
ROS measurements from parental cells were used to normalize
ROS levels for drug-treated cells.
Xenograft tumor studies
PC-9 cells were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of Hank's
Balanced Salt Solution with Matrigel [growth factor–reduced;
catalog #356231 (BD Biosciences)] to a ﬁnal concentration of 5
 107 cells/mL. Nude (nu/nu) mice (Charles River Laboratories) were inoculated subcutaneously with 5  106 PC-9 cells in
100 mL in the dorsal right ﬂank. When tumor volumes reach
about 100 to 200 mm3, mice were separated into groups of 10 or
15 animals with similarly sized tumors, and treatment was
initiated the following day. Mice were dosed via daily (qd) oral
gavage (per os) with erlotinib (50 mg/kg in 7.5% captisol) and/
or disulﬁram (Sigma; Tetraethylthiuram, Catalog # 86720,
dosed at 200 mg/kg formulated in safﬂower oil 95%, benzyl
alcohol 5%), or with vehicle only. Tumor volumes were determined using digital calipers (Fred V. Fowler Company, Inc.)
using the formula (L  W  W)/2. Tumor growth inhibition
(%TGI) was calculated as percentage of the area under the
ﬁtted curve (AUC) for the respective dose group per day in
relation to the vehicle: %TGI ¼ 100  1  (AUC treatment/
day)/(AUC vehicle/day). Curve ﬁtting was applied to log2
-transformed individual tumor volume data using a linear
mixed-effects model using the R package nlme, version 3.1–
97 in R v2.12.0 (24, 25). Mean time to tumor progression (TTP)
was measured as the time (days) to reach twice (2) or 5 times
(5) initial tumor volume. Partial regressions (PR) are deﬁned
as greater than or equal to a 50% decrease from initial tumor
volume, and complete regression (CR) is deﬁned as a 100%
decrease in tumor volume. Plots were generated and statistical
analysis was run using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad
Software).
Metabolic assays
Approximately 5,000 parental cells and 15,000 DTPs were
plated per well in XF 96-well microplates (SeahorseBioscience)
and incubated for 24 hours at 37 C in 5% CO2. Disulﬁram and
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatments were done for 48 hours
in the presence of kinase inhibitor. Oxygen consumption
rate (OCR) and extracellular acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR) measurements were performed in bicarbonate-free, serum-free,
37 C media. Cells were then ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
stained with Hoechst, and four quadrants/well were imaged
using a Molecular Devices ImageXpress HCS. Average
nuclei number per quadrant was determined. Bar graphs

represented the mean  SEM of normalized (cell number)
OCR and ECAR measurements from six wells.

Results
Drug-tolerant cancer cells express the CSC marker
ALDH1A1
To identify gene expression differences in the drug-tolerant
subpopulation, we analyzed the MET-ampliﬁed gastric cancer
cell line, MKN-45, before and after treatment with the MET
kinase inhibitor crizotinib, to which these cells are highly
sensitive (Fig. 1A). Following several days of treatment, about
5% of the cells remain viable and largely quiescent indeﬁnitely
in continuous crizotinib. Among the gene expression differences (Supplementary Table S1), ALDH1A1, one of several
ALDH isoforms, was relatively highly expressed in the drugtolerant subpopulation. Therefore, we further investigated
ALDH activity in MKN-45 cells and in a second MET-ampliﬁed
gastric carcinoma cell line, GTL-16.
The ALDH substrate Aldeﬂuor was used to detect ALDH
activity in individual cells. We observed clear heterogeneity in
ALDH activity within untreated MKN-45 and GTL-16 cell
populations, even though they were derived from single cell
clones. About 5% of MKN-45 cells expressed detectable ALDH
activity (ALDHhigh)) before treatment. Following several days of
crizotinib treatment, ALDHhigh MKN-45 cells were clearly
enriched among those that remained viable DTPs (Fig. 1B),
and after 30 days, most DTPs were Aldeﬂuor-positive (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similar ﬁndings were made in GTL-16
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These results indicate significant overlap between the Aldeﬂuor-positive and the drugtolerant subpopulations.
To conﬁrm that the ALDHhigh cells present before treatment
correspond to the drug-tolerant population, we used two
approaches. First, viability of MKN-45 ALDHhigh and ALDHlow
cells, separated by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS;
Supplementary Fig. S2A), was measured following 72-hour
crizotinib treatment. The second assay involved treating
ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells with crizotinib for 3 weeks and
then allowing DTPs to expand as colonies in the absence of drug.
Both assays revealed increased crizotinib tolerance by MKN-45
ALDHhigh cells compared with ALDHlow cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2B), whereas there was no difference in growth rates of
ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
ALDHhigh cells yielded more colonies of larger size (Supplementary Fig. S2D), and ALDHhigh-derived colonies consist of both
ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells, indicating that ALDHhigh cells can
give rise to ALDHlow cells (Supplementary Fig. S2E).
Although Aldeﬂuor is the preferred substrate for the
ALDH1A1 isoform (26), Aldeﬂuor can be converted by other
ALDH isoforms (27). To determine which ALDH family member(s) contribute to increased ALDH activity in ALDHhigh cells,
we FACS-sorted MKN-45 cells into ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells
and observed about 8-fold upregulation of ALDH1A1 levels in
ALDHhigh cells but no signiﬁcant expression difference for 18
other ALDH isoforms (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Similarly,
ALDH1A1 protein expression was higher in ALDHhigh cells
(Fig. 1C). Increased ALDH1A1 was also observed in crizotinibtreated MKN-45 within 24 hours (Fig. 1D) before drug-induced

apoptosis was detected (Fig. 1E). ALDH1A1 protein was
induced in ALDHhigh and ALDHlow MKN-45 cells, albeit at
much lower levels in ALDHlow cells (Fig. 1C). Consistent with
the enrichment of ALDHhigh cells in the drug-tolerant subpopulation, increased ALDH1A1 was observed in MKN-45 and
GTL-16 DTPs (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that ALDHhigh
cells, present before treatment, and crizotinib-tolerant DTPs
are largely overlapping populations, both expressing elevated
ALDH1A1.
ALDH is required by drug-tolerant cancer cells
To examine a functional role for ALDH in drug tolerance, we
used the drug disulﬁram, which irreversibly inhibits ALDH
enzymatic activity (28, 29). Disulﬁram-treated MKN-45 and
GTL-16 cells exhibited no signiﬁcant viability effects (Supplementary Fig. S3), but when combined with crizotinib, disulﬁram potently eliminated crizotinib-tolerant MKN-45 and GTL16 cells (Fig. 2A and B). Although a brief preexposure to
disulﬁram modestly reduced DTPs for some cell lines, it did

3582

Cancer Res; 74(13) July 1, 2014

not eliminate all DTPs, indicating that continuous disulﬁram
exposure is required to substantially reduce the drug-tolerant
subpopulation (Supplementary Fig. S4A). When MKN-45- and
GTL-16-derived DTPs, established by treatment with crizotinib, were subsequently exposed to disulﬁram, they were effectively eliminated (Supplementary Fig. S4B), conﬁrming a critical requirement for ALDH for DTP survival. Multiple ALDH
isoforms are increased in GTL-16 DTPs (Supplementary
Fig. S5A and S5B), and knockdown of ALDH1A1 had no effect
on drug sensitivity or DTP formation (Supplementary Fig. S6A
and S6B), implicating additional ALDH enzymes. Although
we were unable to knockdown ALDH1A1 in MKN-45 cells
for technical reasons, expression of 12/19 ALDH isoforms was
detected in MKN-45 parental cells and DTPs (Supplementary
Fig. S5D), implicating potential redundancy.
We also tested disulﬁram with the ALDH1A1-negative
EGFR-mutant lung carcinoma cell line PC-9 (Supplementary
Fig. S5C), which expresses other ALDH isoforms (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). PC-9 cells are EGFR-addicted and very

Disulﬁram plus erlotinib effectively killed erlotinib-tolerant
PC-9 cells (Fig. 2C). PC-9–derived DTPs begin expanding as
colonies when treated with erlotinib beyond 10 days (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B) while maintaining drug tolerance.
We previously described these expanded clones as drug-tolerant expanded persisters (22), which, unlike DTPs, are relatively refractory to disulﬁram (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the
observed effects of disulﬁram on PC-9–derived DTPs, expression of several ALDH family members was increased (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). These results implicate multiple
ALDH family members in drug tolerance and suggest that the
role for ALDH in maintaining the viability of this subpopulation is most critical before their expansion as drug-tolerant
clones.
We extended these ﬁndings to additional kinase-dependent cancer cells. In eight cancer cell lines derived from

bition substantially reduced drug-tolerant clones (Fig. 3A
and B). Disulﬁram alone did not cause signiﬁcant cell death
in any tested cell lines.
A similar effect of disulﬁram was observed on DTPs derived
from treating GTL-16 cells with the DNA-damaging agent,
etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Gossypol, another ALDH
inhibitor (30), also showed effectiveness, although with less
potency than disulﬁram, in killing drug-tolerant cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A). To exclude the possibility that the cytotoxic
effect of disulﬁram reﬂects activity on low-density cultures
(DTPs), we plated GTL-16 cells and DTPs at different densities
and treated with disulﬁram. Irrespective of plating density,
disulﬁram effectively killed most DTPs, whereas no cytotoxic
effect was observed on parental cells plated at the same
densities (Supplementary Fig. S6C). A similar analysis of PC9 parental cells revealed disulﬁram sensitivity only in DTPs
(Supplementary Fig. S6D). These results collectively support
the potentially broad ALDH requirement in a drug-tolerant
subpopulation of cancer cells.

similar between GTL-16 ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells, the basal
OCR in ALDHhigh cells is signiﬁcantly higher (Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Fig. S8A). These results reveal increased mitochondrial respiration in ALDHhigh cells, which might lead to
increased ROS. Indeed, we detected relatively high ROS levels
(ROShigh) in ALDHhigh cells (Supplementary Fig. S8C). We then
sorted cells based on ROS levels and measured ALDH1A1 (Fig.
4B and Supplementary Fig. S8B). Consistent with ﬂow cytometric results, ROShigh cells expressed higher ALDH1A1 than
ROSlow cells. Increased DNA damage, a consequence of

increased ROS, was also observed in ROShigh cells, measured
as increased phospho-gH2A.x and phospho-substrates of ATM/
ATR, indicators of double-stranded DNA breaks and DDR,
respectively (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S8B). Both indicators were higher in ROShigh cells, further supporting the CSClike properties of ALDHhigh cells. Furthermore, as in ALDHhigh
cells, DTPs exhibit increased dependence on mitochondrial
respiration (Fig. 4C), suggesting elevated oxidative stress in
DTPs. Increased DNA damage sensor and transducer activity
was also observed in DTPs (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that

Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Contributes to Cancer Drug Resistance

ALDHhigh cells and DTPs use speciﬁc mechanisms to maintain
viability under conditions of increased oxidative stress.
Disulﬁram-induced killing of drug-tolerant cells
requires increased ROS
ALDH enzymes function as detoxifying agents by reducing
toxic aldehydes resulting from lipid peroxidation in cells
undergoing oxidative stress (34, 31). To determine whether
selectively killing of drug-tolerant cells by disulﬁram reﬂects
the role of ALDH in suppressing ROS-induced DNA damage, we
used the ROS scavenger, NAC (N-acetylcysteine). In PC-9 cells,
erlotinib alone caused a 6-fold increase in ROS in DTPs, and an
additional 3-fold ROS increase was observed in cells cotreated
with erlotinib and disulﬁram. Signiﬁcantly, the disulﬁram
effect on ROS was almost completely abrogated when NAC
was added (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained with GTL16-derived DTPs. A small but signiﬁcant increase in ROS was
observed in crizotinib/disulﬁram cotreated cells, and the
addition of NAC caused about 75% decrease in ROS. NAC also
reduced ROS in GTL-16 DTPs by about 60% but failed to reduce
erlotinib-induced ROS in PC-9–derived DTPs (Fig. 5A). These
results suggest that while kinase inhibitor treatment elevates
ROS in kinase-addicted cancer cells, the drug-tolerant subpopulation uses ALDH to protect against ROS-mediated cell
death.
We then examined DNA damage in DTPs in the presence or
absence of disulﬁram and NAC. We observed signiﬁcantly

To investigate the ability of disulﬁram to delay tumor relapse

was ﬁrst tested in vitro; thus, cells were treated with either
erlotinib or disulﬁram alone or in combination, and after 6 days,
cells were maintained with or without disulﬁram for four more
days. We observed a signiﬁcant growth delay in cells treated with
erlotinib þ disulﬁram compared with erlotinib alone, and a further delay in erlotinib þ disulﬁram–treated cells that continued
to receive disulﬁram (Fig. 6A). A pharmacodynamic study of

increased DNA damage in DTPs exposed to kinase inhibitors
plus disulﬁram compared with kinase inhibitor alone, and the
effects of disulﬁram on DNA damage were abrogated by NAC
(Fig. 5B). Notably, ALDH inhibition increased the turnover of
some of the ALDH isoforms (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig.
S7B). The ROS increase in cells cotreated with kinase inhibitor
and disulﬁram also triggered apoptosis of DTPs as revealed by
increased cleaved PARP in GTL-16–derived DTPs and BimS in
PC-9–derived DTPs. Consistent with the ability of NAC to
suppress disulﬁram-induced DNA damage, NAC cotreatment
also decreased cleaved PARP and BimS (Fig. 5B). NAC is also
sufﬁcient to rescue DTPs from the lethal effects of disulﬁram
(Fig. 5C). Collectively, these results suggest that increased
ALDH in the drug-tolerant subpopulation maintains sufﬁciently low levels of ROS to prevent apoptosis.

treated tumors indicated decreased p-EGFR in both erlotinib
and erlotinib þ disulﬁram–treated tumors (Fig. 6C).
In the xenograft tumor growth study, mice were divided into
four groups, namely, vehicle control, disulﬁram control, erlotinib alone, and erlotinib þ disulﬁram groups. As expected,
erlotinib was highly effective, whereas single-agent disulﬁram
caused minimal efﬁcacy (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Table S2).
After 11 days of erlotinib alone or in combination with disulﬁram, most tumors were substantially reduced. Therefore, to
assess the added effect of disulﬁram, all treatments were
stopped, except for disulﬁram, which was continued until the
end of the study. No signiﬁcant loss in body weight was
observed in mice as a result of any of the treatments (Supplementary Table S2).
We observed near-complete regression of tumors with
erlotinib with 11 of 15 mice responding [10 PRs (deﬁned by
>50% decrease in tumor volume) and 1 CR (no measurable
tumor)]. Tumors quickly rebounded following treatment cessation, with a mean TTP of 41 days to reach twice the starting
tumor volume (Supplementary Table S2). Treatment with
erlotinib þ disulﬁram was more effective, with 15 of 15 animals
responding (9 PRs and 6 CRs). Signiﬁcantly, the combination
treatment resulted in a prolonged response, with tumors not
progressing beyond the initial tumor volume (Supplementary
Table S2). These data indicate a highly signiﬁcant (P < 0.0007)
delay in tumor relapse in the erlotinib þ disulﬁram–treated
mice compared with those treated with erlotinib alone, consistent with a role for ALDH in drug tolerance in tumors.

ﬁndings may explain why ALDH1A1 alone, as a prognostic biomarker for worse clinical outcome and metastasis in cancer, has
at best, yielded mixed results (20). In metastatic breast cancer,
such a correlation improved signiﬁcantly when expression of
ALDH1A3, ALDH2, and ALDH6A1 isoforms, as well as ALDH1A1,
was considered (36). Together, these results point to a likely
role for multiple ALDH family members in drug resistance.
The ALDH requirement in drug-tolerant cells for survival
under prolonged drug exposure implicates a drug-induced
increase in aldehyde levels. We speculate that increased oxidative stress in drug-tolerant cells, leading to membrane lipid
peroxidation, is a likely cause of increased aldehyde levels. The
observed increased dependence on mitochondrial respiration,

We have described a drug tolerance mechanism associated
with a cancer cell subpopulation derived from various tissues
of origin, which involves the ALDH enzyme family. Our observations highlight similar properties of ALDHhigh CSCs and
drug-tolerant cancer cells, consistent with previously reported
ﬁndings supporting a role for CSCs in drug resistance (4–6).
These observations suggest potential beneﬁt of combining
ALDH inhibition with targeted cancer therapeutics as a strategy to prevent or delay cancer relapse.
Our studies initially focused on the CSC marker, ALDH1A1,
which is enriched in a subpopulation of MET-addicted gastric
cancer cells that display crizotinib tolerance. This difference in
crizotinib sensitivity between ALDHhigh and ALDHlow gastric
carcinoma cells perhaps provides a mechanism by which CSCs
can maintain viability upon an initial onslaught of a cytotoxic
drug. The observed crizotinib-induced ALDH expression
in ALDHhigh cells may provide a survival advantage over
ALDHlow cells during prolonged drug exposure. Signiﬁcantly,
we observed disulﬁram sensitivity among DTPs derived from
many cell line models, regardless of whether they speciﬁcally
expressed elevated levels of the ALDH1A1 isoform. Indeed, we
observed consistently increased expression of multiple ALDH
family members in drug-tolerant cells, pointing to the effectiveness of disulﬁram in inhibiting multiple ALDH isoforms.
Our results are consistent with the previous observation that
simultaneous knockdown of two ALDH members results in
increased cyclophosphamide sensitivity of lung cancer cells
compared with knockdown of individual members (35). These

Figure 7. Models depicting the proposed mechanism underlying the
speciﬁc cytotoxic effect of disulﬁram (DS) on DTPs. Accumulation of toxic
aldehydes in kinase inhibitor–treated cancer cells increases ROS
levels particularly in the drug-tolerant population. ALDH activity is
required to maintain ROS levels sufﬁciently low to prevent triggering of
apoptosis. Inhibition of ALDH activity by disulﬁram increases ROS levels
above a threshold, consequently triggering apoptosis, a process that can
be suppressed by the ROS scavenger NAC.

Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Contributes to Cancer Drug Resistance

measured as increased OCR/ECAR ratio, is probably a major
source of increased ROS in drug-tolerant cells. Interestingly,
CSCs identiﬁed from gastric cancer cells, deﬁned by high
ALDH1A1 expression, also exhibit elevated ROS and increased
OCR/ECAR, similar to what is seen in the drug-tolerant cells,
and further supporting the presence of a subpopulation of
preexisting (before treatment) cancer cells that exhibit characteristics of drug-tolerant cells.
One of the major consequences of increased oxidative stress
levels is the accumulation of DNA lesions, which can lead to
apoptosis. The activation of DDR in glioma-derived CSCs at a
level higher than that seen in non-CSCs may contribute to the
observed resistance to ionizing radiotherapy (10). Similarly, we
detected increased double-stranded DNA breaks in our model
systems, suggesting that activation of DDR may be a widely
used mechanism of survival of a subpopulation of cancer cells
during cancer therapy.
Other reported mechanisms of action of disulﬁram, including inhibition of P-glycoproteins involved in drug efﬂux and
proteasome inhibition, are seen at relatively higher disulﬁram
concentrations (37, 38). However, our ﬁndings indicating
complete inhibition of phospho-MET in MKN-45 and GTL16 DTPs (Supplementary Fig. S9A) by crizotinib (even in the
presence of disulﬁram), together with no apparent effect of a
proteasome inhibitor MG132 on DTP formation (Supplementary Fig. S9B), would seem to exclude these alternative potential mechanisms of disulﬁram action on DTPs. A recent study
of paclitaxel-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells (39) demonstrated
cytotoxic effect of disulﬁram/Cuþþ on the resistant cells;
however, in contrast to our observation of a lethal effect of
disulﬁram speciﬁc to drug-tolerant cells, disulﬁram/Cuþþ was
equally toxic to parental MDA-MB-231 cells.
We propose a model (Fig. 7) implicating ALDH family
members in maintaining intracellular aldehyde levels (and
consequently, ROS levels) below the threshold beyond which
an apoptotic response is engaged. Our ﬁndings with NAC
cotreatment emphasize the critical importance of managing
ROS levels for the survival of drug-tolerant cells and raise the
possibility of discovering additional therapeutics that can
speciﬁcally elevate ROS levels within the drug-tolerant cells
to delay tumor relapse. Notably, NAC does not protect drug-

sensitive cells from the lethal effects of targeted therapies,
consistent with a unique role in the CSC-like subpopulation.
Our in vivo ﬁndings demonstrate a beneﬁcial effect of the
combination of disulﬁram and erlotinib in signiﬁcantly delaying
treatment relapse. Signiﬁcantly, a phase II clinical trial performed almost two decades ago demonstrated an increased
survival rate of patients with breast cancer who received chemotherapy plus an active disulﬁram metabolite compared with
chemotherapy alone (40). Altogether, these observations suggest
a potential beneﬁt of ALDH inhibition for the treatment of breast
and other cancers. If the cell culture ﬁndings with disulﬁram
cotreatment can be similarly translated to the clinic, there may
be broad opportunities to use this therapeutic strategy to delay
tumor relapse in various cancer treatment contexts.
