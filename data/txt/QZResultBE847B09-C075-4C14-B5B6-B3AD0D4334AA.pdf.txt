BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that skeletal muscle and adipose tissue are linked to overall survival (OS) and progression-free
survival (PFS). Because targeted therapies have improved the outcome in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), new
prognostic parameters are required. The objective of the current study was to analyze whether body composition parameters play a
prognostic role in patients with mRCC. METHODS: Adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and skeletal muscle density (SMD) were assessed
with computed tomography imaging by measuring cross-sectional areas of the tissues and mean muscle Hounsfield units (HU). A
high level of mean HU indicates a high SMD and high quality of muscle. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method
and compared with the log-rank test. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was adjusted for Heng risk score and treatment. RESULTS: In the 149 patients studied, the median OS was 21.4 months and was strongly associated with SMD; the median OS
in patients with low SMD was approximately one-half that of patients with high SMD (14 months vs 29 months; P 5.001). After adjustment for Heng risk score and treatment, high SMD was associated with longer OS (hazards ratio, 1.85; P 5.004) and longer PFS (hazards ratio, 1.81; P 5.002). Adding SMD will separate the intermediate-risk and favorable-risk groups into 3 groups, with different
median OS periods ranging from 8 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 6 months-12 months) for an intermediate-risk Heng
score=low SMD to 22 months (95% CI, 14 months-27 months) for an intermediate-risk Heng score=high SMD and a favorable-risk
Heng score=low SMD to 35 months (95% CI, 24 months-43 months) for a favorable-risk Heng score=high SMD. CONCLUSIONS: High
muscle density appears to be independently associated with improved outcome and could be integrated into the prognostic scores

INTRODUCTION
Tumors of the kidney represent approximately 2% to 3% of new cancer cases diagnosed each year and approximately onethird of patients will eventually develop metastatic disease. Better knowledge of prognostic and predictive factors could
improve the management of metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) by identifying those patients at a higher risk of death or
disease progression. The most commonly used prognostic scores are the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center score
and the recent Heng risk score for patients receiving targeted therapies.1,2
Since the introduction of targeted therapies, survival has doubled. However, if new drugs have proven efficacy with
regard to progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with mRCC, the discordance between the response to treatment and
overall survival (OS) has been noted.3 Therefore, predictive as well as prognostic markers need to be studied extensively.
Many prognostic scores incorporate clinical and biological factors, but to the best of our knowledge none integrate measurements of body composition such as quantity of fat or skeletal muscle. Patients with RCC who have a higher body mass
index (BMI) have been reported to have a significantly better prognosis than those with a lower BMI.4,5 However, the favorable prognostic roles of overweight and obesity have been challenged.6,7 In addition, body composition parameters (ie, adipose
tissue and skeletal muscle) have been shown to be linked with prognosis in patients with cancer. Previous studies have shown
that low skeletal muscle mass (ie, sarcopenia) is linked to a shorter OS in obese patients with colorectal cancer and in obese

patients with pancreatic cancer.8,9 High levels of muscle performance as have been reported in lung cancer,10,11 or high
skeletal muscle density (SMD) as has been described in the
elderly and in patients with stage III melanoma, are also
prognostic of a longer OS.12,13 With regard to adipose tissue, the results are conflicting. High adipose tissue and especially visceral adipose tissue (VAT) have been reported as
either related to better OS14,15 or to shorter survival.16 The
objective of the current study was to analyze whether skeletal
muscle (either muscle mass or muscle function based on the
SMD) and adipose tissue play a prognostic role in patients
with mRCC who are treated with targeted therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

We selected all patients treated at the Institut GustaveRoussy in Paris, France who were enrolled in 3 prospective multicenter trials: the TARGET trial (Treatment
Approaches in Renal Cancer Global Evaluation Trial)
(n 5 83), which assessed the efficacy of a dose of sorafenib
of 400 mg given twice daily versus placebo17; the RECORD trial (Renal Cell cancer treatment with Oral
RAD001 given Daily) (n 5 28), which assessed the efficacy of an oral dose of 10 mg=day of everolimus versus
placebo18; and the sunitinib phase 2 trial (n 5 38), which
assessed the efficacy of sunitinib at a continuous daily
dose of 37.5 mg.19 Of note, the 83 patients from the
TARGET trial were included in previous studies assessing
the prognostic role of sarcopenia.22
For the original trials, patients provided informed
consent, and these studies were approved by the research
ethics board of all centers according to good clinical practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable regulations. Additional analysis of clinical data and the
interpretation of body composition from computed tomography (CT) images were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institut Gustave-Roussy.
The inclusion criteria for these 3 studies were very
similar: histologically proven clear cell mRCC and evidence of measurable disease, after at least 1 line of therapy.
Full details of the main studies have been previously
described.17-19
Anthropometry and Body Composition by
Analysis of CT Imaging

Weight and height were measured prospectively at baseline as part of the protocol. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated (ie, BMI 5 weight in kg=height in m2).
Body composition features were evaluated using the
same CT images obtained at baseline for tumor assess3378

ment. Baseline CT scans were performed within 28 days
before the initiation of therapy and all the measurements
were performed by 1 technician who was blinded to
patient information, clinical treatment, and outcome.
Directly measured variables in the current study were
lumbar cross-sectional areas (cm2) of skeletal muscle,
VAT, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) as described
in previous studies.20 Total adipose tissue (TAT) was calculated as TAT 5 VAT 1 SAT. The third lumbar vertebra (L3) was chosen as a landmark because L3 crosssectional areas and whole-body measurements are linearly
related.21 CT images were analyzed using SliceOMatic
software (version 4.3; TomoVision, Magog, Quebec,
Canada). To evaluate the density of the skeletal muscle,
we measured the mean radiation attenuation of skeletal
muscle, which describes the input images read by the SliceOMatic software. The pixel values of these images displayed in shades of gray represent the physical properties
of the scanned tissue expressed in a numerical form. The
mean attenuation (expressed as the mean Hounsfield unit
[HU]) has been extensively studied as a correlate of muscle density.12 Muscle density assessed by this method
reflects fatty muscle infiltration, with a lower mean HU
indicating lower density and more fatty infiltration. This
highly reproducible method correlates with muscle triglyceride contents on muscle biopsy.12 As in previous
studies, these values were normalized for height scale and
are expressed as cm2=m2.20,22
Statistical Analysis

Since the distribution of adipose tissue, skeletal muscle,
and SMD differs greatly according to sex, for each parameter the population was dichotomized in 2 groups:
patients with a value under the median value in patients of
the same sex and patients with a value that was equal to or
above the median value in patients of the same sex. Baseline values (at the time of treatment initiation in the trial)
of body parameters were expressed as the median, interquartile range, and coefficient of variation corresponding
to the standard deviation divided by the mean (noise-tosignal ratio). PFS was defined as the time from treatment
to the first documentation of disease progression or death
from any cause, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as a  20% increase in SLD as per
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST,
version 1.0). OS was defined as the time from treatment
to death or last contact. The PFS and OS were estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method with Rothman 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and compared across the
groups using the log-rank test.

The association between each body parameter with
death and disease progression was evaluated using the Cox
proportional hazards model. Univariable analysis assessed
the association between OS and PFS and the following
variables: sex (male vs female), Heng score risk groups
(favorable-risk vs intermediate-risk vs poor-risk groups),
active therapy (yes if sorafenib, sunitinib, or everolimus;
no if placebo), type of therapy (vascular endothelial
growth factor [VEGF] inhibitor-containing therapy vs
other therapies), and BMI (< 18.5 kg=m2 vs 18.5-24.9
kg=m2 vs  25 kg=m2). The interaction between sex and
all body parameters was systematically tested. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for variables with a P value
< .20 in the univariable models using a backward stepwise
strategy to eliminate nonsignificant variables at a P value

RESULTS
Patients

After the exclusion of patients who did not meet the criteria for inclusion (n 5 40), 142 patients and 119 patients
had data available regarding tissue areas and SMD, respectively (Fig. 1). Among the 101 patients receiving active
therapies, 83 received VEGF inhibitor therapy.
The Heng risk score classified 61% of the patients as
being of favorable risk, 36% as being of intermediate risk,
and 3% as being of poor risk. Body composition parameters differed between men and women, reflecting the

(Table 1). Adipose tissue parameters were scattered, especially VAT, which presented high coefficients of variation
in men (61%) and women (107%). Only 4 patients were
considered to be malnourished (BMI of < 18.5 kg=m2).
Overall Survival

In the 149 patients included in the current study, the median OS was 21.4 months (95% CI, 18.4 months-23.9
months) and was strongly associated with SMD; the median OS in patients with high SMD (29 months [95%
CI, 21 months-43 months]) was 2-fold longer than that
of patients with low SMD (14 months [95% CI, 10
months-22 months]) (P 5 .001) (Figs. 2a and 2b). No
association between OS and TAT or muscle area was
found. OS was not found to be associated with BMI category (P 5 .99).
No interaction was found between the respective
effects of sex and each body parameter on survival.
When adjusted for Heng risk score, SMD below the
median value for patients of the same sex was associated
with higher mortality (hazards ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% CI,
1.3-2.9) (Table 2), whereas OS was not found to be associated with either a low level of muscle area (HR, 1.2;
95% CI, 0.8-1.7) (P 5 .40) or a low TAT level (HR, 1.2;
95% CI, 0.8-1.7) (P 5 .38). Adding SMD to the Heng
risk score was found to define 3 groups instead of 2 for the
intermediate-risk and favorable-risk groups, with a different median OS ranging from 8 months (95% CI, 6
months-12 months) for an intermediate-risk Heng scorelow SMD to 22 months (95% CI, 14 months-27 months)
for an intermediate-risk Heng score=high SMD and
3380

favorable-riskHeng score=low SMD to 35 months (95%
CI, 24 months-43 months) for a favorable-risk Heng
score=high SMD.
Progression-Free Survival

In the 149 patients included in the current study, the
median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.2 months-6.5
months) and was strongly associated with SMD; the
median OS in patients with high SMD (8 months (95%
CI, 6 months-11 months) was 2-fold longer than that
of patients with low SMD (4 months; 95% CI, 4
months-6 months) (P < .001) (Figs. 2c and 2d). No
association was found between PFS and TAT and muscle area. PFS was not associated with BMI category
(P 5 .73)
Multivariable analyses were not stratified based on
sex because there was no interaction noted between the respective effects of sex and each body parameter on PFS.
Active treatment was associated with better PFS (Table 2) but in treated patients there was no significant effect
of the type of therapy noted (VEGF receptor [VEGFR]
inhibitor vs mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor:
HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.7 [P 5 .97]).
When adjusted for Heng risk score and active treatment, PFS was found to be associated with SMD
(P 5 .002); SMD below the median value for patients of
the same sex was associated with a higher rate of death or
disease progression (HR of death or disease progression,
2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9) (Table 2), but the PFS was not
associated with either a low level of muscle area (HR, 1.0;
95% CI, 0.7-1.4 [P 5 .86]) or with a low TAT level (HR,
0.9; 95% CI, 0.6-1.2 [P 5 .37]).

incidence of mRCC. A high percentage of overweight or
obese patients was found in the current study (68%) and in
2 other therapeutic trials (56% and 58%, respectively).14,16
The relations between RCC and overweight or obesity
appear to be seem more complex than expected. The influence of BMI on OS and PFS has been found in patients
before nephrectomy and removal of the tumor might affect
outcome.5,15 With the exception of the study by Tang et
al,23 studies focusing on mRCC, including the current one,
failed to demonstrate a prognostic role for BMI.6 Overweight or obese patients appear to have a more favorable
prognosis than those with a normal BMI among those with
organ-confined RCC only, when surgery is planned and
may be in a specific ethnic population.5
Adipose tissue, and especially VAT, is not simply a
way to store energy, but should be considered as a true
endocrine compartment with the secretion of various hormones that interact with tumor progression.24 Two studies
have found opposite results. In a study of 64 patients with
mRCC who were treated with anti-VEGF, Ladoire et al
demonstrated that high VAT was associated with a shorter
OS and PFS (HR, 6.3) (P < .001).16 Conversely, the study
by Steffens et al reported that high VATs and SATs were
both found to be independently associated with longer PFS
and OS.14 Two criticisms can be made in both studies: the
cutoff points were not defined according to sex and both
studies analyzed CT images measured at the umbilicus,
which has never been correlated to the whole adipose and
muscle tissue. Using measurements at L3 and adjusting the
results to patient sex, we did not find any influence of VAT
and SAT on either OS or PFS.
Muscle mass, as well as muscle functional status,
have been shown to be linked with clinical outcomes. In
patients with cancer, low skeletal muscle mass was shown
to be linked to anticancer treatment toxicity22,25 and to
Cancer

OS in sarcopenic obese patients.8,9 Muscle function as
assessed by a low level of peak oxygen consumption and a
6-minute walk test of < 400 meters (clinically significant
cutoff) was found to be strongly associated with survival
in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.10,11
We did not find any correlation between skeletal
muscle mass and OS. The discrepancy we observed in the
current study between results for muscle mass and SMD
could be similar to what has been previously reported in
elderly patients for SMD measures and risk of hospitalization,26 and in patients with stage III melanoma.13 In this
latter study, which was performed among 101 patients,
SMD was found to be significantly associated with both
disease-free survival (P 5 .04) and distant disease-free survival (P < .001). It is interesting to note that, similar to
the results of the current study, no significant association
was found between outcomes and muscle area. Muscle
density has been shown to be closely related to muscle
lipid content and muscle function,12 and it is linked to
inflammatory processes, whereas skeletal muscle mass
may be associated with the imbalance between proteolysis
and muscle anabolism. These 2 concepts are very similar
but do not reflect the same mechanisms.
It is interesting to note that the current study enrolled only patients from clinical trials, and therefore the
prognostic role of SMD should be validated in a realworld experience. However, 2 recent studies have demonstrated a similar relationship between SMD and patient
outcome. Sabel et al13 reported that the SMD was an important predictor of outcome in a cohort of patients with
stage III melanoma. Martin et al also recently published
interesting results.27 They demonstrated that patients
with cancers of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts,
with involuntary weight loss, muscle depletion, and low
SMD, shared a poor prognosis.27.

Conclusions

There is increasing evidence of a close association between
body composition and outcome in patients with mRCC.
The main finding of the current study is that patients with
a high quality of muscle (high muscle density) have an OS
and PFS that are twice that of patients with a low quality
of muscle (low muscle density). By integrating the SMD
status in the Heng risk score, we were able to add a new
prognostic group among the patients with intermediaterisk and favorable-risk Heng scores. There is a gradient in
OS and PFS from the group with an intermediate-risk
Heng score and low SMD, to the group with an
intermediate-risk Heng score and high SMD or a
favorable-risk Heng score and low SMD, to the group
with a favorable-risk Heng score and high SMD, presenting the longest OS and PFS.
Prognostic factors for improved OS are lacking for
patients with mRCC because the prognosis has been
improved with targeted therapies. The results of the current study indicate that muscle density could be used as a
prognostic factor and could improve the usual prognostic
scores. However, further studies are needed to better
define the threshold values for muscle density.
