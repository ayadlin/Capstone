Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of
Lapatinib in HER-2–Positive
Advanced Breast Cancer
Quang A. Le, PharmD1 and Joel W. Hay, PhD
BACKGROUND: A recent clinical trial demonstrated that the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine in the
treatment of HER-2–positive advanced breast cancer (ABC) significantly increases median time to progression. The objective of the current analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this therapy from the US
societal perspective. METHODS: A Markov model comprising 4 health states (stable disease, respond-totherapy, disease progression, and death) was developed to estimate the projected-lifetime clinical and economic implications of this therapy. The model used Monte Carlo simulation to imitate the clinical course of
a typical patient with ABC and updated with response rates and major adverse effects. Transition probabilities were estimated based on the results from the EGF100151 and EGF20002 clinical trials of lapatinib.
Health state utilities, direct and indirect costs of the therapy, major adverse events, laboratory tests, and
costs of disease progression were obtained from published sources. The model used a 3% discount rate
and reported in 2007 US dollars. RESULTS: Over a lifetime, the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine as
combination therapy was estimated to cost an additional $19,630, with an expected gain of 0.12 qualityadjusted life years (QALY) or an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $166,113 per QALY
gained. The 95% confidence limits of the ICER ranged from $158,000 to $215,000/QALY. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated less than 1% probability that the ICER would be lower than
$100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds in oncology treatment, the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine is not clearly cost-effective; and most likely to
result in an ICER somewhat higher than the societal willingness-to-pay threshold limits. Cancer

Breast cancer is the most common female cancer in the United States, the second most common cause
of cancer death in women (after lung cancer), and the main cause of death in women aged 45 to 55 years.1
In 2007, it was estimated that approximately 178,480 American women were diagnosed with breast cancer, and more than 40,000 were expected to die from this disease.1 The National Cancer Institute estimated that about 2.4 million women with a history of breast cancer were alive in 2004; most of these
women were cancer-free, whereas others still had evidence of cancer and may have been undergoing

treatment.2 Because of high prevalence, morbidity, and
mortality, considerable research and development effort is
devoted to developing new breast cancer treatments.
Many of the newer treatment approaches are associated
with substantially higher costs.
Among patients with breast cancer, approximately
20% to 30% have human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive disease, which is associated with
poor treatment outcomes.3 Furthermore, unlike early
stage breast cancer, most metastatic breast cancer is incurable; thus leading to relatively poor prognosis in HER-2–
positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. Treatment, as a result, has been limited to controlling the
spread of metastases and improving the quality of life
without causing a detrimental effect on survival.4
Recently, lapatinib (Tykerb; GlaxoSmithKline,
Research Triangle Park, NC), an orally administered
small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase domains of
HER-1 and HER-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, has been approved by Food and Drug Administration
in combination with capecitabine for treatment of HER2–positive MBC (second-line therapy) for those who had
been previously treated with trastuzumab. The
EGF1000151 clinical trial5,6 demonstrated that the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine in the treatment of HER2–positive advanced breast cancer significantly improved
the median time to progression (TTP) by 8.5 weeks (18.6
weeks vs 27.1 weeks; P ¼ .00013) and overall response
rate by 9.8% (13.9% vs 23.7%; odds ratio ¼ 1.9; 95%
confidence interval, 1.1-3.4). Nonetheless, the cost-effectiveness of the new therapy with lapatinib has not been
determined. The objective of this study was to develop an
economic model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of lapatinib in second-line treatment
of HER-2–positive breast cancer based on the
EGF100151 clinical trial of lapatinib as well as updated
outcomes data reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June 2007.5,6

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Economic Model
This economic model was a cost-effectiveness analysis
evaluating capecitabine monotherapy and the capecitabine plus lapatinib combination therapy from the US

societal perspective. Time to progression (time from randomization to disease progression or death because of
breast cancer) was the specified primary endpoint of the
EGF100151 clinical trial.5,6 Secondary endpoints
included overall response rate (percentage of subjects
achieving either a complete or partial response), progression-free survival (PFS, time from randomization to disease progression or death because of any cause), and
overall survival (OS, time from randomization to death
because of any cause).
We constructed a Markov model comprising of 4
health states: MBC treatment with disease-free progression, respond-to-therapy, disease progression, and death.
In each health state, the gains in direct and indirect costs,
life-months, and quality-adjusted life months (QALMs)
were estimated over time. In our model, patients began
their treatment in the stable-disease health state; then they
could move to the respond-to-therapy health state if the
tumor responded to treatment; or they could stay at the
same health state or move to the disease-progression
health state. Death could occur in any health state; therefore, patients did not necessary die only in the disease-progression state. Similarly, patients in the respond-totherapy health state could stay in the same health state or
move to the disease-progression health state, whereas
patients in the disease-progression health state could stay
in the same health state or eventually die (Fig. 1).
Our model used Monte Carlo simulation to track
the clinical course of MBC patients with response rates
and adverse effects taken from clinical trial data. The analysis was carried out in Microsoft Excel using Visual Basic
to run the model simulations. Transition probabilities

were derived primarily from the results from EGF100151
and EGF200027 clinical trials of lapatinib using the
‘‘DEALE’’ method.8 To validate our transition probabilities, we simulated a first-order Monte Carlo method on
the estimated transition probabilities to obtain the output
results. We then iteratively calibrated the estimated
parameters until the model consistently produced results
similar to the clinical trials outcomes. Finally, the newly
calibrated transition probabilities were applied to generate
model results (Table 1). Each cycle of the Markov model
was set to be 1.5 months (or approximately 6 weeks) to
replicate the true interval time for patient re-examination
that was used in the trial. The model was run until all
patients died (lifetime horizon extrapolation). A discount
rate of 3% was used in our model.9

Patient Population
The baseline patient in the model is a 53-year-old woman
who has progressive, HER-2–positive, locally advanced or
metastatic breast cancer and has previously been treated
with a minimum of anthracycline, taxane, and trastuzumab. Patients with pre-existing heart disease or conditions
that could affect gastrointestinal absorption or previously
treated with capecitabine were ineligible. The combinaCancer

tion regimen consisted of lapatinib at a dose of 1250 mg
daily, and capecitabine at a dose of 2000 mg per square
meter of body surface area in 2 divided doses on Days 1
through 14 of a 21-day cycle; the monotherapy (capecitabine only) was administered at a dose of 2500 mg per
square meter of body surface area in 2 divided doses on
Days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle.5,6

Costs
Healthcare resource costs were based on published data
and were expressed in 2007 US dollar (Table 2). The estimated drug cost per patient was based on the wholesale
acquisition cost.10 In the clinical trial of lapatinib, the average doses of capecitabine in combination and in monotherapies were reported to be 2 000 mg/m2/day and 2377
mg/m2/day, respectively. The mean cost of treating a cardiac event was assumed to be $1979.11 The range of costs
per severe diarrhea event (grade III/IV) was between
$2559 and $8230.12,13 Other costs of monitoring laboratory tests, including left ventricular ejection fraction
exam, renal function test, complete blood count, and liver
function test, were based on the Medicare reimbursement
code for 2007.14 It is less likely that trastuzumab-containing therapies would be given in third-line treatment once

disease progressed in patients who had already been refractory with trastuzumab-containing regimens; thus, the average monthly cost after disease progression was derived
from the study of McLachlan et al15 in third-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer and was set at a baseline
value of $3535 (in 2007 US dollars with 3% discount
rate). The combination therapy of lapatinib and capecitabine showed significant reduction in central nervous
system (CNS) metastasis events compared with monotherapy (2% vs 6%; P ¼ .045). The baseline annual cost
per CNS metastasis event was $100,000 based on a study

FIGURE 2. Estimated overall survival based on the Markov model with 20,000 Monte Carlo simulations is shown.

Major Assumptions
The EGF100151 clinical trial of lapatinib was halted prematurely because of clinically meaningful and statistically
significant advantage in the primary endpoint (TTP) in
the combination therapy with lapatinib and capecitabine
versus capecitabine monotherapy. All monotherapy
patients were offered an option of switching to the combination therapy. There was no significant difference in
median OS reported in the combination therapy (15.78
months) and monotherapy (15.54 months).5,6 This was
likely caused by the crossover from monotherapy to combination therapy when the trial was halted; thus an
assumption was needed to adjust for OS differences. We
therefore assumed that the mean duration of survival after
disease progression was the same with both therapies. In
addition, the mean duration of survival after disease progression was estimated by subtracting the mean PFS from
the mean OS (ie, mean duration of survival after progression ¼ mean OS  mean PFS). As a result, the estimated
mean OS in combination therapy and monotherapy
would be 17.52 months (mean PFS of 6.32 months þ
mean duration of survival after disease progression of
11.20 months) and 15.54 months, respectively (Fig. 2).
Cancer

In our sensitivity analyses, we further varied the duration
of survival after disease progression in the combination
therapy in accordance with the 95% confidence interval
of OS. In other words, when the mean PFS is 6.32
months, varying the OS in the combination therapy
within its 95% confidence interval will result in varying
the duration of survival after disease progression.

Sensitivity Analysis
We performed both 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of varying our base case assumptions on the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year
gained. In the 1-way sensitivity analysis, the effect of changes
in individual base case parameters across possible ranges of
values was investigated. We conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis in which key parameters were simultaneously
and randomly varied over the appropriate probability distributions using Monte Carlo simulation with 20,000 runs
(Table 2). On the basis of the simulation results, we constructed a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve at different
willingness-to-pay thresholds as well as 95% confidence limits for the base case ICER.21

RESULTS
Base Case Results
Over the lifetime horizon, after the model was calibrated
and run on 20,000 simulated patients, in the base case,
the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine in the combination therapy was estimated to cost an additional $19,630
with an expected gain of 0.12 quality-adjusted life years
(QALY). Thus, from the US societal perspective, ICER
was estimated to be $166,113 per QALY gained (or
approximately $13,843 per QALM gained) (Table 3).
The simulation model outcome results were as follows for the combination and monotherapy groups,
respectively: 1) the mean times to progression were
approximately 6.21 months and 4.24 months, 2) the
494

mean overall response rates were 24.1% and 13.6%, 3)
the mean OS was 17.41 months and 15.45 months, and
4) the mean duration of survival after disease progression
was 11.20 months and 11.22 months. In addition, the average total costs per patient were estimated at $66,499
with combination therapy versus $46,869 with monotherapy (Table 3).

Sensitivity Analyses

incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. The

from $115,000 per QALY gained to the combination
therapy being dominated. The base case ICER was most

sensitive to treatment differentials in duration of survival
after disease progression, cost of lapatinib, and the health
utilities in stable-disease and respond-to-therapy health
states. As the major assumption in our model, we varied
only the duration of survival after disease progression in
the combination therapy from 7.4 months to 15.0

months based on the 95% confidence interval of median
OS reported in the EGF100151 trial (approximately
13.7-21.3 months). The resulting ICER, similarly, ranged
from $115,000/QALY to being dominated (Fig. 4).
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed ICER 95%
confidence limits ranging from $158,000 per QALY to
$215,000 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness
acceptability curve indicated less than 1% probability that
the ICER would be lower than $100,000/QALY, and less
than 2% probability that the ICER would be lower than
$150,000/QALY (Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 4. A plot of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER) and changing duration of survival after disease progression in the combination therapy from 7.4 months to 15.0
months is based on the 95% confidence interval (CI) of median overall survival (OS) reported in the EGF100151 trial
(approximately 13.7-21.3 months), while holding the OS in the
monotherapy fixed at 15.54 months. QALY indicates qualityadjusted life years.

The current cost-utility analysis based on the pivotal clinical trial indicated that the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine as a combination therapy for second-line treatment
of HER-2–positive metastatic breast cancer was less likely
to be cost-effective when compared with commonly
accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds in oncology treatment (even at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/
QALY).22,23 In the clinical trial of lapatinib, PFS was used
as the secondary endpoint. Using PFS instead of OS as a
criterion for effectiveness in MBC to estimate the ICER
would result in an overestimation of quality of life before
disease progression and an underestimation after progression as a weight of 1 for life-years before progression of

FIGURE 5. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows <1% and <2% probability that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio

respectively; 95% confidence limits range from $158,000 per QALY to $215,000 per QALY gained.

disease (no adjustment for health state utility) and a
weight of zero after disease progression (no accounting for
duration of survival after disease progression) were
applied.24 The resulting ICER derived from PFS only was
about $133,670 per progression-free life-year gained. It
is, again, less likely that treatment with lapatinib in
advanced breast cancer is cost-effective.
Because there was lack of standard clinical practice
on treatment for trastuzumab-refractory patients, and the
EGF100151 clinical trial was the only clinical evidence on
the effectiveness of lapatinib, our economic model used
the monotherapy with capecitabine as the only comparator with the combination therapy. Several nonrandomized
controlled and observational studies25-29 have shown
some benefits for continuing treatment with trastuzumabcontaining therapies after disease progression; however,
the results have varied widely depending on patient population included as well as treatments used. As a result, it
would be premature to compare indirectly the combination therapy of lapatinib and capecitabine with trastuzumab-containing therapies.
Because of significant improvement in the primary
endpoint (TTP) in the combination therapy compared
with the monotherapy, all patients in the monotherapy
arm were offered an option of switching to the combination therapy; resulting in a ‘‘crossover’’ effect. This effect
likely caused an insignificant difference in median OS
between the 2 therapies (although there was a significant
difference in TTPs). To adjust for the crossover effect, we
assumed that the mean survival times after disease progression were the same in the 2 therapies. Therefore, the
estimated difference of the mean OS between combination therapy and monotherapy was approximately 2
months (8.5 weeks); which was the same as the estimated
difference in median PFS between the 2 therapies (8.5
weeks). We believed that the assumption was realistic and
justified. Without this assumption, the resulting ICER
was well above $500,000/QALY. In addition to varying
this assumption in the sensitivity analyses, our threshold
sensitivity analysis showed that, with an assumption of
23.5 months in OS for the combination therapy with
lapatinib, the ICER was lower than the willingness-to-pay
(WTP) threshold of $100,000/QALY.
Quality-of-life utilities in the different health states
used in our model were not obtained from the clinical
trial, but rather from the breast cancer literature. Ranges
496

of utilities with reported means in 3 of the metastatic
breast cancer health states were obtained from a similar
study of HER-2–positive metastatic breast cancer.18 The
model was sensitive to the ranges of utilities in the stable
disease health state (approximately $150,000 to $195,000
per QALY gained) and in the respond-to-therapy health
state ($156,000 to $189,000 per QALY gained), but not
sensitive in the disease-progression health state ($165,800
to $166,700 per QALY gained).
On the basis of the assumed random distributions of
our key model parameters, the probabilistic sensitivity
analysis showed 95% confidence limits of the ICER
between $158,000 and $215,000 per QALY gained. At a
WTP of $100,000/QALY, there is a <1% probability
that the resulting ICER would be lower than this WTP
threshold. Our threshold sensitivity analysis indicated
that only at 65% of the current acquisition cost of lapatinib (approximately $14.95 per 250-mg tablet) would the
ICER be lower than the WTP threshold of $100,000/
QALY.
In addition, the economic burden of CNS metastases among patients with primary breast cancer as reported
in Pelletier et al16 was estimated to cost, on average, about
$100,000 per year in each patient. The cost-effectiveness
of the combination therapy with lapatinib depends on the
risk reduction of CNS metastases used in the base case.
This subgroup of high-risk patients would benefit most,
as the clinical trial showed 3-fold greater reduction in risk
of brain metastases in the combination therapy (risk of
2%) compared with the monotherapy groups (risk of
6%). Applying lapatinib therapy to this subgroup with an
assumption of 10% in absolute risk of CNS metastases
(ie, 30% absolute risk of CNS metastases in the monotherapy), our model estimated that the resulting ICER
would be approximately $90,000/QALY. It is suggested
that clinical trials should be conducted in the subgroup of
patients with high risk of CNS metastases so that potential
cost and clinical benefits can be assessed.
A limitation of the current analysis was that cost and
clinical data were not available after disease progression;
thus, assumptions were derived from the relevant published literature of metastatic breast cancer. Nevertheless,
the cost-effectiveness results were robust to wide ranges of
parameter values in our sensitivity analyses. Moreover, it
would be possible to extend our results to other Western
countries, as our model was mostly sensitive to duration

of survival after disease progression, the price of lapatinib, and the health utilities in the stable-disease and
respond-to-therapy health states, which are parameters
not widely variable across Western countries. When we
assumed the medical costs (cost of CNS metastasis event,
medical costs after disease progression, cost of severe diarrhea event, and costs of related lab tests) in other typical Western countries were 30% lower than those in the
US, the resulting base case ICER was still approximately
$150,000/QALY.

CONCLUSION
Our economic evaluation of the combination therapy
with lapatinib and capecitabine in advanced breast cancer
patients resulted in an ICER of $166,113 per QALY
gained. Compared with commonly accepted willingnessto-pay thresholds in oncology treatment, the addition of
lapatinib to capecitabine is not clearly cost-effective and
most likely results in ICER somewhat higher than the
willingness-to-pay threshold limits.
