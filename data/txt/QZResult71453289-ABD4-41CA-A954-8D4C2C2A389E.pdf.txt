Abstract
In this work we show a clinically feasible strategy to convert in situ the own
tumor into an endogenous vaccine by coating the melanoma cancerous cells with
CD28 costimulatory ligands. This therapeutic approach is aimed at targeting T-cell
costimulation to chemotherapy-resistant tumors which are refractory and been
considered as untreatable cancers. These tumors are usually defined by an enrichment
of cancer stem cells and characterized by the higher expression of chemotherapyresistant proteins. In this work we develop the first aptamer that targets
chemotherapy-resistant tumors expressing MRP1 through a novel combinatorial
peptide-cell SELEX. With the use of the MRP1 aptamer we engineer a MRP1-CD28
bivalent aptamer that is able to bind MRP1-expressing tumors and deliver the CD28
costimulatory signal to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The bi-specific aptamer is able
to enhance costimulation in chemotherapy-resistant tumors. Melanoma-bearing mice
systemically treated with MRP1-CD28 bivalent aptamer show reduced growth, thus
proving an improved mice survival.
Besides, we have designed a technically feasible and translational whole-cell
vaccine (Aptvax). Disaggregated cells from tumors can be directly decorated with
costimulatory ligand aptamers to generate the vaccine Aptvax. CD28Aptvax made
of irradiated tumor cells coated with the CD28-agonistic aptamer attached to MRP1
elicits a strong tumor- cell immune response against melanoma tumors reducing
tumor growth.

Introduction

one of them (Macugen anti VEGF aptamer) has already
been approved by the FDA for the treatment of macular
degeneration [1]. Aptamers can be chemically synthesized,
they are less immunogenic compounds than protein-based
products, and they show higher plasticity. Considering all
these advantages, it is easy to envision that in the near
future aptamers will gain a significant niche in the clinic
[2].
Chemotherapy is still one of the first-line

Aptamers are defined as single-stranded
oligonucleotide ligands that are selected through a
complex combinatorial technique known as Systematic
Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment
(SELEX). Aptamers display high affinity and specificity
for their targets, and represent a new therapeutic platform
in life science. There are several aptamers in clinical trials;

also previously shown for the first time that bi-specific
PSMA-4-1BB aptamer could be used to target 4-1BB
costimulation to PSMA-expressing tumors eliciting a
potent antitumor immune response and displaying reduced
toxicity with a wider therapeutic index than conventional
4-1BB agonist [21]. That work was extended by Schrand
et al., 2014, to target 4-1BB costimulation by using a
bi-specific aptamer to VEGF as a tumor stroma marker,
showing again a better therapeutic index than regular
4-1BB agonist [22].
In a quest to find a target which is broadly expressed
among most of the tumors, especially the most aggressive
ones, and which may target key cells that are critical for
chemotherapy resistance and tumor progression (cancer
stem-like cells), we selected through a combinatorial
peptide-Cell High Throughput (HT) SELEX an aptamer
against the extracellular exposed motif of MRP1. This
aptamer was used to isolate from melanoma B16/F10
cells a cancer stem cell subpopulation that shows a more
aggressive tumor phenotype and higher chemotherapy
resistance profile. The MRP1 aptamer was used to
generate a bi-specific MRP1-CD28 aptamer, which was
used to create a CD28Aptvax (irradiated tumor cells
coated with CD28 agonistic aptamer).

treatments for oncologic patients. However, resistance
to chemotherapy drugs is quite common among patients
undergoing different chemotherapy regimens [3]. Lack of
therapeutic approaches to tackle residual chemotherapyresistant tumor cells puts those patients at high risk of
disease recurrence.
Chemotherapy treatment will act as a positive
selection pressure on the tumors, favoring the survival
of those cells with higher expression of chemotherapyresistant mechanisms, such as MRP1, ABCC2, etc. [4-6].
Multidrug Resistant-associated Protein 1 (MRP1) has been
directly correlated with chemotherapy drug resistance in
several types of tumors [4, 7-10], and, along with other
chemotherapy-resistant proteins, it is highly expressed in
cancer stem cells [11-13]. It has been evidenced that tumor
stem cells are the main responsible cells for chemotherapy
drug resistance in the long term. Cancer stem cells are
significantly enriched in chemotherapy-resistant tumor
lesions [14, 15]. They have also been underscored as key
players in tumor progression and metastasis spreading
[16]. For this reason, cancer stem cells are in the spotlight
for the development of novel targeting oncologictherapeutic approaches.
New therapeutic approaches are desired to eradicate
chemotherapy-resistant tumors. Cancer immunotherapy
has emerged with strength within the arsenal of
therapeutic strategies in oncology upon the success of
recent clinical trials. Tumor immunity can be promoted
by either counteracting tumor immunosuppression
(releasing the brakes) or by triggering immune activation
(pushing the gas pedal). T-cell activation is provided
by TCR and costimulatory ligands’ engagement. CD28
has been underscored as one of the major costimulatory
receptors on T lymphocytes, promoting proliferation and
cell differentiation into effector T cells [17]. The artificial
expression of CD28 ligand (B7.2) on melanoma tumors
has been shown to favor tumor immune rejection and to
work as a tumor vaccine with irradiated tumor cells [18].
This sort of vaccines based on tumor-irradiated cells that
are transfected with immune-modulatory genes (GVAX,
FVAX, IVAX, etc.) has shown limited success in clinical
trials, basically due to the cumbersome technological
challenge of generating autologous tumor-transfected
cells, which implies the generation of a stable transfected
self-tumor cell line. In order to circumvent this caveat, in
clinical trials allogeneic tumor cell lines were used instead
of autologous tumors, limiting the tumor-specific antigen
repertoire and, therefore, their efficacy [4, 19]. A plausible,
clinically feasible approach is to use as tumor vaccine
self-tumor irradiated cells decorated with immunepotentiated aptamers, obtained directly from primary
tumor disaggregation.
We have recently generated a CD28 agonist aptamer
that was proved to potentiate the antitumor immune
response induced in tumor-specific antigen vaccination,
enhancing tumor-bearing mice survival [20]. We had

MRP1 aptamer selection by peptide-cell HTSELEX
Since MRP1 is 17 trans-membrane protein with very
few exposed extracellular amino-acids, it is not feasible
to obtain the recombinant soluble protein to perform
regular SELEX. Therefore, we performed a combined
aptamer selection using Peptide-SELEX and Cell-SELEX
as shown in Figure 1. Studying the MRP1 structure [23,
24], its pattern of glycosylation [25] and the homology
of most conserved regions among different species,
we identified one peptide from extracellular domain
to perform the SELEX (RLSVYGALG). The peptide
was synthesized with a biotin group at the N terminal;
as control for counter-selection we used a scrambled
peptide. We started the selection with a 25N-randomized
DNA library flanked at 5’ and 3’ for constant region; the
DNA library was transcribed with MutT7, which allows
for the incorporation of 2’-Fluoro-pirimidin, conferring
stability and RNAses resistance. We performed 10
rounds of selection against MRP1-peptide; the selection
restriction was increased in each round as described
in Table S1. During each SELEX round we performed
counter-selection against the scrambled peptide. As the
binding of aptamer to a protein peptide does not assure
the binding of the aptamer to the native protein exposed
in the cell-membrane surface, we performed the last

as counter selection.

round of selection (R11) by Cell-SELEX by using the
chemotherapy-resistant tumor cell line that has high
MRP1 expression (H69AR) [10] and as counter selection
the parental cell line H69.
The aptamer libraries obtained at rounds R10 and
R11, before and after Cell-SELEX respectively, were
HT-sequenced by Ion Torrent. The sequences obtained
from the deep sequencing analysis from each round of
selection (R10 and R11) (Supplementary Data 1, 2, 3, 4)
were aligned using Clustal W and FASTAptamer for R10
and for R11 [26]. The phylogenetic representation of the
sequences at rounds R10 and R11 is shown in Figure 2.
12 major sequences were identified after Cell-SELEX at
R11 that were also present at R10 (Supplementary table 2).
Frequencies changed dramatically for aptamer 3 (Figure
2A, 2B), clearly indicating that not all the aptamers that
bind to the peptide recognized the native MRP1 protein
with the same affinity. The aptamer 3 that was most
abundant in R11 was used for further experiments and
would be named MRP1Apt.
To determine the affinity of the MRP1Apt (aptamer
3) to its target we performed a nitrocellulose filter-binding
assay to the MRP1-peptide. The aptamer showed a high
affinity to MRP1-peptide with a Kd of 50 nM (Figure 2C),
but not to the scrambled peptide. The peptide to which
MRP1Apt binds is quite conserved among species (same

in human and mouse). Therefore, the aptamer will likely
bind to all the MRP1 homologues within all the species
that have this preserved peptide. In order to ensure the
binding of the MRP1Apt aptamer to MRP1-expressing
cells, we performed a flow cytometry assay with biotinlabeled MRP1Apt and PE-streptavidin. We utilized the
high MRP1-expressing human cell line H69AR, which
has been selected from H69 (lung cancer human cell
line) after several passes with anthracycline drugs [10].
As seen in Figure 2D the MRP1Apt binds to H69AR but
not to H69, proving that the aptamer binds to MRP1 on
the cell. We evaluated whether the aptamer would be
able to reverse chemotherapy resistance to doxorubicin
and etoposide in H69AR by MTT, but it did not have any
inhibition (Supplementary Figure 1), indicating that the
aptamer binds to regions of MRP1 proteins that might not
be important for the expulsion of chemotherapy drugs.
Most of the MRP1 protein is exposed within the cell, and
the pore function is regulated from cytosolic domain [24],
indicating that its function might be easily modulated by
targeting the cytoplasmic domain of MRP1.
As drug resistance has been associated with cancer
stem cells [13], we reasoned that the MRP1Apt could
be used to enrich a subpopulation of cancer stem cells.
So we stained melanoma B16/F10 cells MRP1Apt that
bind to a highly preserved peptide in MRP1 (identical

the MRP1-CD28 conjugated aptamer maintains its
binding and costimulation capacity. In order to do that, we
performed a nitrocellulose filter-binding assay to MRP1
peptide; the MRP1-CD28 bi-specific aptamer is capable of
binding to MRP1 aptatope (Figure 3B). We further assayed
the binding of the bi-specific aptamer to MRP1-B16 cells
and to the B16/F10 (Supplementary Figure 3). To test
if the CD28 maintains the costimulation capacity, we
performed a CFSE dilution assay on isolated CD4 T cells
suboptimally activated with anti-CD3 and the MRP1CD28 bi-specific aptamer; the MRP1-CD28 aptamer
construct induces a potent proliferation signal on T cells
(Figure 3C). The final in vitro characterization experiment
consisted in coating irradiated B16/F10 like cancer stem
cells with the MRP1-CD28 bi-specific aptamer or the nontargeting CD28 agonistic aptamer and, after cell-washing,
culture with isolated CD4 lymphocytes activated with a
suboptimal dose of anti-CD3 (Figure 3D). Proliferation
was measured by 3H thymidine incorporation. As it is
shown in Figure 3E, only the cancer-like stem cells that
were pre-incubated with MRP1-CD28 aptamer are able to
trigger the CD28 costimulatory signal.
Specific in vivo targeting of MRP1-CD28 conjugates
was tested in mice co-implanted with B16-MRP1 and the
parental cell line contralaterally in opposite flanks. When
tumors reached 10 mm of diameter, mice were injected
intravenously with 250 pmols of bi-specific aptamer
MRP1-CD28 (Supplementary Figure 4A). Mice were
sacrificed 24 hours later, and tumors were excised and
disaggregated to measure by qRT-PCR the accumulation
of the aptamer in each tumor. As we observed in
Supplementary Figure 4B, the bi-specific aptamer
concentration was 3-fold higher in B16-MRP1hi tumors
compared with the parental B16 tumors.
To evaluate in vivo the immune response elicited
by the treatment of MRP1-CD28 bi-specific aptamer,
we treated B16-MRP1 tumor mice with the bi-specific
aptamer as indicated in Figure 4A, and at day 15 mice were
sacrificed to excise the tumor and assess T-lymphocyte
infiltration by anti-CD3 immunohistochemistry (Figure
4B) and by qRT-PCR for the production of immunocytokines. We observed a significant increase of IFN-ү,
TNF-α and IL-10 cytokines on the group of mice treated
with the bi-specific aptamer versus the control groups
(Figure 4C).

sequence in mouse), and we performed sorting of those
cells that have a higher expression of MRP1. These
mouse B16 isolated cells mirror the chemotherapyresistant tumor cells enriched in cancer patients that are
refractory to chemotherapy treatments [10]. The sorted
cells were expanded for a few days and analyzed for
MRP1 expression by flow cytometry (Supplementary
Figure 2A). To prove whether those cells have a stronger
cancer stem phenotype, we performed an analysis on a set
of known genes that are up-regulated on cancer stem cells
(TERT, CD44, Aldh, ABCG2, notch1 and β-catenin) by
qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 2B). As we can see in
Supplementary Figure 1B, these melanoma cells have a
higher expression of CD44 30-fold change and Aldh 15fold change, and the other markers are up-regulated 5 to 3
times. These results indicate that these selected cells show
phenotype-like cancer stem cells. Another characteristic
of cancer stem cells is their capacity to grow forming
spheres; indeed, we observed that these cells could grow
forming spheres while the parental B16/F10 cell line did
not (Supplementary Figure 2C). Finally, to study whether
this subpopulation of cells were able to tolerate higher
doses of chemotherapy (another characteristic of cancer
stem cells), we performed an MTT assay in the presence
of the chemotherapy drugs doxorubicin and etoposide
(chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with drug
resistance through MRP1 overexpression) [10]. The B16/
F10 cancer stem cells displayed a much higher resistance
to chemotherapy drugs than the parental B16/F10 cell line
(Supplementary Figure 2D, E).

Functional characterization of bi-specific MRP1CD28 aptamer conjugates
Based on the premise that lack of costimulation
at the tumor site might hamper the ability of tumorspecific T cells to eliminate the tumor cells, we developed
a bi-specific aptamer that is aimed at targeting CD28
costimulation to chemotherapy-resistant MRP1 cancer
cells. We have previously shown that CD28 agonistic
aptamers are able to costimulate T lymphocytes and
promote tumor immunity when used as adjuvants in
tumor-antigen vaccination. MRP1-CD28 bi-specific
aptamer will provide to the infiltrating lymphocytes the
CD28 costimulus; concurrently, the tumor cell will elicit
the TCR signal through MHC class I. The bi-specific
aptamer construct was engineered based on secondary
predicted structures using the algorithm software
RNAstructure. The sequence and structure of the MRP1CD28 aptamer conjugate is specified in Figure 3A; the bispecific aptamer is made of a single 2-Fluoro pyrimidine
RNA oligonucleotide and not two independent aptamer
conjugated by hybridization [21, 22]. The bi-specific
aptamer contains two CD28 aptamer motifs to allow for
the costimulation by CD28 crosslinking and the MRP1
aptamer motif. First, we characterized in vitro whether

As we have shown, the bi-specific aptamer is
enriched in tumors with higher concentration of MRP1,
which indicates that the bi-specific MRP1-CD28 aptamer
could be used to elicit targeting tumor immunity in a much
more efficient fashion than the CD28 agonist aptamers.

However, as the stimulus induced by CD28 tumortargeting promotes Th1 cytokines (IFN-ү, TNF-α) but it
also promotes the immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10),
we reasoned that, in order to have an antitumor effect, the
immunosuppressive environment should be diminished.
In order to do that, we treated the mice with Foxp3
blockade peptide (P60) [27] that inhibited Treg function
transiently and we boosted the tumor immune response

with Gvax (GM-CSF producing B16-F10 irradiated cells)
immunization. B16-MRP1-bearing mice were treated as
shown in the immunization calendar (Figure 5A). Mice
that were treated either with Gvax or with Gvax plus
P60 displayed a slight inhibition in tumor growth, while
those mice that were treated with the whole combination
(Gvax, P60 and MRP1-CD28 bi-specific aptamer) had a
significant inhibition in tumor growth (Figure 5B) and

measure. We observed a statistically significant delay in
the tumor growth of the mice treated with CD28Aptvax
versus the control vaccine (Figure 6G).
The immune response elicited by this new
formulation of vaccine CD28Aptvax was determined
in mice immunized as in Figure 6B, by measuring the
proliferation of T lymphocytes and the production of
IFN-ү by ELISA on the supernatant of cultured isolated T
cells from proximal lymph node or spleen from immunized
mice. As can be seen in Figure 6C-6F, LN and spleen
lymphocytes from the mice that have been vaccinated
with CD28Aptvax have a higher T-cell proliferation and
production of IFN-ү than the control groups.	

CD28Aptvax improves tumor mice survival
It is usually technically cumbersome to generate
a stable tumor cell line from primary tumors. This is a
major technical limitation for the use of self-gene modified
irradiated cell-based vaccines in the clinic (e.g. GVAX,
IVAX or FLVAX, among others), which have shown very
promising results in preclinical models. An alternative to
this approach is to artificially link to the cell membrane an
immune-modulatory ligand on disaggregated tumor cells
obtained directly from the primary tumor samples. To that
end, we generated CD28Aptvax, consisting of irradiated
tumor cells coated ex vivo with bi-specific aptamer that
binds to cell-surface protein on tumor cells (MRP1) while
the other part of the aptamer provides the costimulatory
receptor stimulus (CD28 agonist) (Figure 6A). We used
the B16-MRP1 irradiated cells, and we coated them with
the bi-specific aptamer MRP1-CD28. The CD28 agonistic
aptamer-coated tumor cells were injected subcutaneously
in C57BL6 mice as shown in the vaccine calendar (Figure
6B), and the tumor growth was monitored by caliper

Discussion
Here we described a new aptamer to target MRP1expressing cells; we used a novel SELEX combinatorial
approach to identify an aptamer that binds to a preserved
aptatope on MRP1. This approach could be used for
aptamer selections in which it is impossible to obtain a
recombinant soluble protein as it occurs with multiple
trans-membrane proteins. Thanks to the progress in
the last few years in the field of HT-SELEX and the
existence of new valuable software packages to perform

the analysis, we were able to follow the evolution of the
aptamer library from the peptide-SELEX (R10) to the
CELL-SELEX (R11), which allowed us to identify the
aptamer that is able to bind to the MRP1 aptatope and to
the MRP1-expressing cell.
MRP1 is a 190 KDa transmembrane protein which
functions as a transporter of various molecules across
extra- and intra-cellular membranes, and is involved in
multi-drug resistance [10, 28]. MRP1 is associated with
chemotherapy resistance in several types of tumors (lung,
melanoma, etc.) [4, 8, 10], being highly up-regulated in
tumor patients that relapse upon chemotherapy treatment
[29]. But, at the same time, it is an up-regulated marker
on cancer stem cells, which are precisely the cells that
are more resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy
and, therefore, the ones responsible for tumor relapse
in the long term [15]. Here we were able to isolate a
subpopulation of chemotherapy-resistant cells with a
cancer stem cell-like phenotype by using the MRP1
aptamer. It has previously been confirmed by other
groups that chemotherapy resistance is associated with
the enrichment of cancer stem cells [14, 15]. Here we
proposed a clinically feasible approach that will target
chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells with cancer stem
cell-like phenotype. This approach could be a desirable
therapeutic tool for patients that, though apparently
responsive to conventional chemotherapy treatment,
still maintain residual disease, possibly enriched in
chemotherapy-resistant cells, and who, in the end, are
bound to relapse.
CD28 is a receptor expressed in T lymphocytes
which engulfs different types of subpopulation. In order
to elucidate the immunological nature of the infiltrating
T lymphocytes upon treatment with MRP1-CD28Apt,
we assessed the expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-10.
TNF-α and INF-γ are key cytokines of a Th1 polarized
T-cell response, while IL-10 is characteristic of Th2
polarized T-cell response and immunosuppressive
cytokines. This indicates that CD28 might also be
triggering immunosuppression [30]. Following this line of
thought, we performed an in vivo experiment to treat B16MRP1 tumors with the bi-specific aptamer or its controls
in the presence of Gvax so as to boost the efficacy of the
treatment and P60 peptide to abrogate Treg function [27].
Based on the results, immunization with Gvax provided
the boosting of T-cell response elicited by the bi-specific
aptamer and the P60 peptide transiently blocked FOXP3
activity [27], favoring the efficacy of the treatment.
This approach would provide two possible
major advantages versus systemic costimulation with
conventional agonist: 1- the targeting, concentrating
the costimulation signal at the tumor and reducing side
effects on other tissues [21, 22]. 2- The immobilization of
the costimulatory aptamer to the tumor might provide a
more efficient crosslink of the CD28 receptors, delivering
a more potent costimulatory signaling.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Previous bi-specific aptamers were designed to
enhance 4-1BB costimulation at the tumor site [21, 22].
Here we described the use of a new bi-specific aptamer
to target CD28 costimulation to cancer stem cells,
which are the key players in chemotherapy resistance.
The generation of this type of constructs reflects the
aptamer plasticity to generate hetero-dimers which is
more complicated to achieve with antibodies. The same
approach to target costimulation chemotherapy-resistant
tumors with overexpression of MRP1 could be used
with other stimulatory aptamers such as 4-1BB, OX40 or CD40 [31-33]. The reduced toxicity associated
with targeting approaches would ideally allow for
the combination of several of these target stimulatory
approaches in the future. This is highly unlikely to happen
with non-targeting approaches such as antibodies, which
have already shown some toxicity by themselves in
clinical trials [34]. Their combination, even if it could
favor the antitumor response, would inevitably exacerbate
the systemic auto-reactive immunity [35].
In order to bypass the technical limitations of using
genetically modified irradiated cell-based vaccines, we
attempted to generate a new type of vaccines that consists
in artificially linking costimulatory ligands to the irradiated
tumor-cell membrane “Aptvax”. The use of genetically
modified vaccines has shown limited success in clinical
trials due to the problem of generating a stably transfected
self-tumor cell line. We coated irradiated B16-MRP1 cells
with the bi-specific aptamer and subcutaneously injected
them in mice (CD28AptVax). The tumors expressing the
CD28 costimulatory aptamer were significantly smaller
than those of control (Figure 6G), which was associated
with a stronger antitumor immune response (Figure 6C6F). These results reinforce the idea of anchoring the
CD28Apt-dimer aptamer to the cell surface so as to better
deliver the costimulatory signal, which must therefore be
further investigated. The irradiated cells already induce an
immune response due to the antigen input, which recruits
the immune system cells. The bi-specific aptamer provides
proper CD28 co-stimulatory ligands to boost that preexisting immune response. The results provide the proof
of concept that the CD28AptVax is effective, thus delaying

be used in the future as a new type of vaccine, bypassing

MRP1-Aptamer selection by peptide-cell HT
SELEX
The 25N randomized RNA library consisting of
two constant flanking sequences of 22 nucleotides and 46
23191

Oncotarget

nucleotides at the 5’ and 3’ end respectively was transcribed
from partially randomized DNA sequences: Forward
primer 5’- GGGGAAT TCTAATACGACTCACTATA
GGGAGAGGGAGAATAG -3’ and Reverse primer
5’- GGGAGAAGGGAGAAAGGAAG -3’. This sort of
25N randomized libraries is known to present about 411
different starting sequences. The selection was carried
out in the presence of 150 mmol/l NaCl, 2 mmol/l CaCl2,
20 mmol/l HEPES (pH 7.4), 0,01% BSA binding buffer.
Before each round of selection, in order to eliminate those
specific RNAs that bind to biotinylated MRP1 peptide
(RLSVYGALG) and sepharose streptavidin (Strp) beads
(Amersha GE Healthcare Bio-science), the RNA library
was subject to counter-selection with a scrambled peptide
(DEGTHQ). During the counter-selection step, the library
is incubated with the scrambled peptide and sepharose
Strp beads (Amersha GE Healthcare Bio-science) at 37oC
for 30 minutes. The pre-cleared RNA pool present in the
supernatant obtained after bead-pelleting by centrifugation
was subsequently used for the selection step.
The pre-cleared RNA pool was incubated with the
bead-coupled MRP1 peptide and washed three times with
washing buffer that contained 150 mmol/l NaCl, 2 mmol/l
CaCl2, 20 mmol/l HEPES (pH 7.4), so as to remove the
non-interacting RNA species. The MRP-1 peptide-binding
RNA species were extracted after 30 minutes of incubation
through phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1),
followed by reverse transcription and PCR amplification.
The PCR product was transcribed in the presence of
2’-F-pirimidines and T7 polymerase using Durascribe T7
transcription Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI) and used as
library for the next round of selection.
The selection was carried out in ten rounds while
increasing the stringency throughout the rounds of
selection. The RNA-protein ratio was increased in each
round as well as the final volume of binding reaction. RNA
species from round 10 were analyzed with Clustal W and
FastaAptamer software.
The last round of selection (R11) was performed by
Cell-SELEX, using the chemotherapy-resistant tumor cell
line that has the highest MRP1 expression (H69AR) [10]
and the parental cell line H69 as counter selection. The
selection was carried out against 500,000 cells in binding
buffer containing 150 mmol/l NaCl, 2 mmol/l CaCl2, 20
mmol/l HEPES (pH 7.4) at 37ºC for 30 minutes. RNA
extraction was done with TRIzol, followed by reverse
transcription and PCR amplification with the specific
primers. R11 was deep-sequenced with Ion Torrent and
analyzed with Clustal W and FASTAptamer software.

as described [32]. The aptamer transcription was carried
out with α-ATP P32 and PAGE purified; we used 100000
cpm labeled aptamer for the binding assay. The aptamer
was re-folded by heating at 65ºC and progressive cooling
until 37ºC in binding buffer containing 150 mmol/l NaCl,
2 mmol/l CaCl2, 20 mmol/l HEPES (pH 7.4). The labeled
aptamer was incubated with the protein at different
concentrations in binding buffer for 30 minutes at 37ºC
and then added into the dot blot machine including a
nitrocellulose filter. The aptamer bound to the protein is
identified in a film. As binding control we used the IgG1
protein and randomized 2’F- RNA library (control Apt).

Measurement of MRP1Apt aptamer affinity to its
target by flow cytometry
105 H69 cells were centrifuged and subsequently
washed with PBS and stained with 50 pmol of the biotinMRP1Apt and 0.05 µg/µl of streptavidin-PE for 30
minutes at 37 ºC. Afterwards, cells were washed twice
with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (FacsCalibur).

Isolation of melanoma cancer stem cells
106 melanoma B16/F10 cells were stained with
PE-labelled MRP1Apt and the sorting of those cells that
have the highest expression of MRP1 (less than 1%) was
carried out. The sorted cells were expanded for a few
days and analyzed for MRP1 expression assessed by flow
cytometry.

Assessment of melanoma cancer stem-cell
phenotype by qPCR
2 μg of RNA extracted from B16/F10 cells or
B16MRP1 cells cultured in the cell culture media for
the same period of time, were retro-transcribed and
analyzed in a Fast Real Time PCR system (Applied
biosystems, 7900 HT, Foster city, CA, USA ) for stemcell genes (TERT, CD44, Aldh, ABCG2, notch1 and
β-catenin) using the following primers: TERT Fwd
5’- ACTCAGCAACCTCCAGCCTA -3’; TERT Rev

Culture of melanoma sphere stem cells

optimally activated with an anti-CD3 antibody. CD4+
lymphocytes were isolated from the spleen using the
Miltenyi negative selection kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn,
CA). 105 purified CD4+ lymphocytes were stained with 2
μmol/l of CFSE. CFSE-labeled cells were incubated with
1 µg/ml of plate coated with antibody anti-CD3 145-2C11
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and 150 pmol of MRP1CD28 bi-specific aptamer or the unconjugated aptamer,
and randomized 2’F-RNA oligo as Apt control.
To evaluate the dual function of MRP1-CD28 bispecific aptamer we performed H3 thymidine proliferation
assay. 10,000 B16MRP1-irradiated tumor cells were
incubated with 50 pmol of MRP1-CD28 bi-specific
aptamer, or MRP1/CD28 unconjugated aptamer or CD28
monoclonal antibody (37.51) or control aptamer. After 30
minutes of incubation at 37ºC in PBS, cells were washed
twice to culture them with 100,000 isolated CD4 T cell/
well, activated in 96-well CD3-coated plates (1 µg/ml).
T-cell proliferation was assessed at day 4 upon the addition
of H3.

B16/F10 and B16MRP1 cells were grown in a
serum-free culture medium DMEM/F12+GlutMAXTM-I
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 1% N2 supplement
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY), 2% B27 supplement (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY), 20 ng/ml murine FGF-2 (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA), and 50 ng/ml EGF (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). 2·104 cells were plated in a 6-well
ultra-low attachment plate (Corning, Lowell, MA, USA)
and supplemented with medium after 3 days. After 7 days
cells were analyzed for melanoma sphere formation by
light microscopy.

MTT assay
A total of 15,000 B16/F10 or B16-MRP1 cells
were plated in 0.1 ml in 96-well flat bottom plates and
then exposed to doxorubicin and etoposide (final volume
of 0.2 ml per well). 48h afterwards, 20 μl of 5 mg/ml
MTT solution in PBS were added to each well for 4h.
After removal of the medium, 170 μl of DMSO were
added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. The
absorbance at 540 nm was determined by using a plate
reader.

Measurement of in vivo targeting of melanoma
cancer stem cells by qPCR
B16/F10 or B16MRP1 tumor were implanted
in opposite flanks of CD57BL6 mice. At day 15, when
tumors reached 10 mm of diameter each, mice were
intravenously injected with 250 pmol of MPR1-CD28Apt.
We assured that the size of the tumors was equal. Cells
isolated from tumors placed in opposite flanks of
C57BL6 mice were processed and RNA-extracted with
TRIzol and 2µg of RNA was retro-transcribed (Applied
biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA). qRT-PCR was
performed with SYBR green (Applied biosystems, Foster
city, CA, USA) and the following primers: Fwd 5’GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG -3’ and Rev
5’- GGGAGAAAGGAAGGAGAAGGTC -3’ in the Fast
RT-PCR system (7900 HT, Applied biosystems, Foster
city, CA, USA).

Generation of MRP1-CD28 Bi-specific aptamer
For the construction of the MRP1-CD28 Bi-specific
aptamer, the CD28Apt7-dimer was used as template for a
first PCR with the following primers: Fwd 5’- GGGAG
ACCC ACCCATAAAAGGGAGAGAGGAAGAGG-3’
and Rev 5’ - GACTATTCTCCCGGGAG ACCC
ACCCATATTTCCCGGGATCCAGTACTATC-3’. This
first PCR product was used in a second PCR with the
primers FwD 5’-GGGAGACCCACCCATAAAAG-3’
and
Rev5’-GGGAGAAAGGAAGGAGAAGTC
GCCCCAAACGATTTGTTGACTATTCTCCCG
GG-3’. Finally, this product was used as template
for the final PCR with the following primers: Fwd
5’-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3’ and
Rev 5’-GGGAGAAAGGAAGGAGAAGTC-3’. In
order to generate the MRP1-CD28 bi-specific aptamer
with 2’-fluoro-RNA pyrimidines, in vitro transcription of
PCR-DNA template with the kit Durascribe (Epicentre,
Madison, WI) was performed.

Assessment of in vivo MRP1-CD28 bi-specific
aptamer-mediated
immune
response
by
immunohistochemistry
6-8 week-old female C57BL6 mice were
subcutaneously implanted with 105 B16-MRP1 cells. At
days 1 and 2 after tumor implantation, mice were injected
intravenously with 200 pmol of bi-specific aptamer or
the aptamers separately at the same concentration with
three mice per group. When tumors reached around 5
mm of diameter, they were injected again with 200 pmol
of bi-specific aptamer or the aptamers separately at the
same concentration. 3 days later, mice were sacrificed
and the tumor was surgically removed. The tumors that
were selected have a similar size of 10 mm of diameter

MRP1-CD28 bi-specific aptamer proliferation

and no sign of necrosis. Tumors were paraffin-embedded
and stained with anti-CD3 SP7 clone and developed with
EnVision system (Dako, CA, USA).

B16-MRP1 cells were irradiated at 5,000 rad. The
cells were incubated at 40,000 cell/ pmol of aptamer in
PBS at 20,000 cell/µl at 37ºC sacking for 30 minutes;
afterwards, the cells were washed twice with PBS. The
vaccine was performed subcutaneously in the inguinal
area, 500,000 cells per leg. As control Aptvax we used
B16-MRP1 irradiated cells incubated with unconjugated
MRP1/CD28 aptamer and washed as with CD28Aptvax.
Mice were vaccinated three times, three days apart, and at
day 15 after the first vaccine the mice were inoculated with
B16-MRP1 tumor to follow tumor growth and survival.
For immunological studies mice were vaccinated with
CD28Aptvax three times, three days apart, and at day 15
mice were sacrificed to extract the spleen and the inguinal
lymph nodes. The lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph
nodes were incubated with B16-MRP1 irradiated cells in a
1:10 ratio. INF-ү production was measured by ELISA and
proliferation after 72 hours was assessed by H3 thymidine
incorporation.

Assessment of in vivo MRP1-CD28 bi-specific
aptamer-mediated immune response by qRT-PCR
6-8 week-old female C57BL6 mice were
subcutaneously implanted with 105 B16-MRP1 cells. At
days 1 and 2 after tumor implantation, mice were injected
intravenously with 200 pmol of bi-specific aptamer or
the aptamers separately at the same concentration with
three mice per group. When tumors reached around
5 mm of diameter at day 12, they were injected again
with 200 pmol of bi-specific aptamer or the aptamers
separately at the same concentration. 3 days later, mice
were sacrificed and the tumor was surgically removed.
Total RNA from tumor tissue was extracted with RNAse
kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). 2 µg of total
RNA was retro-transcribed using the retro-transcriptase
(Applied biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA), and qRTPCR was performed using the following primers:
TNF-α Fwd 5’- CCTCACACACTCAGATCATCT
-3’; and Rev 5’- GCTACGACGTGGGCTACAG -3’;
IFN-γ Fwd 5’- GCCACGGCACAGTCATTGA -3’; Rev

105 B16-MRP1 cells were injected in C57B6 mice
in the right flank. Mice were treated for 10 days with P60
(100 μg/ mouse); at days 1, 3 and 6, they were treated
with B16 Gvax (106 cells) subcutaneously or PBS (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY), and 200 pmol/injection of the MRP1CD28 bi-specific aptamer or the unconjugated aptamers
intravenously at days 1, 3, 6 and 8. B16 Gvax cells are
irradiated B16 transfected cells that secrete GM-CSF;
these cells were previously used in some of our previous
studies [21] and have been kindly provided by Dr G.
Dranoff. B16 Gvax cells were irradiated at 5,000 rads and
injected subcutaneously in inguinal area 500,000 cell/leg.
Tumor size was calculated by measuring the long (D) and
short diameter (d) of the tumor with a caliper following
the formula Dxd2/2. Mice were sacrificed if they showed
signs of discomfort (loss of weight and mobility), and
when the tumor reached 1,500 mm3.
