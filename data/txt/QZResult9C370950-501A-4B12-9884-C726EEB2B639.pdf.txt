Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF), and their receptors are important
targets in cancer therapy based on angiogenesis inhibition.
However, it is unclear whether inhibition of VEGF and PDGF
together is more effective than inhibition of either one alone.
Here, we used two contrasting tumor models to compare the
effects of inhibiting VEGF or PDGF alone, by adenovirally
generated soluble receptors, to the effects of inhibiting both
together. In RIP-Tag2 tumors, VEGF and PDGF inhibition
together reduced tumor vascularity and abundance of
pericytes. However, VEGF inhibition reduced tumor vascularity without decreasing pericyte density, and PDGF inhibition
reduced pericytes without reducing tumor vascularity. By
contrast, in Lewis lung carcinomas (LLC), inhibition of VEGF
or PDGF reduced blood vessels and pericytes to the same
extent as did inhibition of both together. Similar results were
obtained using tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG-013736 and
imatinib. In LLC, VEGF expression was largely restricted to
pericytes and PDGF was largely restricted to endothelial cells,
but, in RIP-Tag2 tumors, expression of both growth factors
was more widespread and significantly greater than in LLC.
These findings suggest that inhibition of PDGF in LLC reduced
pericytes, and then tumor vessels regressed because pericytes
were the main source of VEGF. The vasculature of RIP-Tag2
tumors, in which most VEGF is from tumor cells, was more
resistant to PDGF inhibition. The findings emphasize the
interdependence of pericytes and endothelial cells in tumors
and the importance of tumor phenotype in determining the
cellular effects of VEGF and PDGF inhibitors on tumor vessels.

Introduction
Angiogenesis is a pivotal process in the growth, invasion, and
spread of tumors (1–3) and is used as a therapeutic target in
several types of cancer based on the abnormalities of tumor blood
vessels (4–6). Endothelial cells of tumor vessels are disorganized,
loosely connected, branched, sprouting, and form a defective
cellular lining of the vessel wall (7). Pericytes, which play a key role

in vascular development, stabilization, maturation, and remodeling
(8–10), are present on tumor vessels but have multiple abnormalities, including loose association with the vessel wall, impaired
support of endothelial function, and altered protein expression
(11, 12).
Endothelial cells and pericytes interact through vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF) signaling (13). VEGF is a key driver of angiogenesis
in many tumors where VEGF signaling promotes endothelial cell
survival, proliferation, and migration (14). Because pericytes
are a source of VEGF (15, 16), they contribute to the survival
and stability of endothelial cells (16, 17). PDGF-B, produced by
endothelial cells, acts on PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-h on pericytes
(18, 19). PDGF-B signaling regulates the recruitment of pericytes
to endothelial cells (9, 20–22) and is important for pericyte survival (23–25). Some tumor cells express VEGF (26) or PDGF in
prostate, ovarian, and non–small cell lung cancers (27, 28).
The benefits of targeting both pericytes and endothelial cells in
tumor vessels have been shown in several tumor models (15, 24,
29). Inhibition of VEGF together with PDGF is a promising strategy
for suppressing angiogenesis in tumors. Receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors that block VEGFRs (SU6668 or SU10944) and PDGFRs
(imatinib mesylate) are more efficacious in combination than when
used alone (15, 24, 30, 31). However, with the use of multitargeted
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it is difficult to unravel the
effects of inhibiting VEGFR from those of inhibiting PDGFR.
The aim of the present study was to develop a better understanding of the respective contributions of inhibiting VEGF and
inhibiting PDGF in settings where both targets are inhibited. To
address this issue, we used a soluble VEGFR-1 ectodomain (AdVEGFR1; ref. 32) and a soluble PDGFR-h ectodomain (Ad-PDGFRh)
delivered by adenoviral transduction of hepatocytes in the liver
(33). These two constructs allow selective inhibition of VEGF and
PDGF alone or in combination. These agents were investigated in
two mouse tumor models with known differences in sensitivity to
VEGF and PDGF inhibition. In spontaneous pancreatic islet tumors
in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice (RIP-Tag2 tumors; ref. 34), tyrosine
kinase blocking PDGFRs increases the effects of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors of VEGFRs on tumor size and growth (15, 24, 30, 31).
However, blockade of VEGFR and PDGFR-h together does not have
an additive inhibitory effect on tumor growth in Lewis lung
carcinomas (LLC tumors; ref. 33).
Our studies revealed that in RIP-Tag2 tumors, blocking VEGF
and PDGF by Ad-VEGFR1 and Ad-PDGFRh had greater effects on
the tumor vasculature than did blocking VEGF or PDGF alone,
whereas in LLC tumors, either Ad-PDGFRh or Ad-VEGFR1 alone
reduced tumor vascularity and pericyte abundance as much as did

administering the two agents together. Similar results were
obtained when we targeted VEGF and PDGF signaling using the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG-013736, which blocks VEGFRs (35, 36),
and imatinib, which blocks PDGFRs (37). The contrasting
responses of the two tumors were consistent with differences in
the amount and cellular location of VEGF and PDGF in the tumors.

Materials and Methods
Animals. Tumor-bearing RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background; ref. 34) were studied at 10 wk of age (36). For the implantation
of LLC tumors, we used two different approaches as described in
Supplementary data. All experiments were done in accordance with the
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of California, San Francisco. In each experimental group, 5 to
10 mice were included.
Construction and use of adenoviral vectors. The Ad-VEGFR1
construct encoding the murine VEGFR-1 ectodomain, the Ad-PDGFRh
construct encoding the murine PDGFR-h ectodomain, and Ad-Fc encoding
the constant Fc region of human immunoglobulin G were prepared as
previously described (32, 33, 38). Both soluble ectodomains of VEGFR-1 and
PDGFR-h had a COOH-terminal 6xHis epitope tag (32, 33, 38).
Mice were injected i.v. on day 0 with (a) Ad-PDGFRh at a dose of 4  109
plaque-forming units (pfu); (b) Ad-VEGFR1 at a dose of 1  109 pfu (32); (c)
combination of Ad-PDGFRh and Ad-VEGFR1 at a dose of 4  109 and 1 
109 pfu, respectively; or (d) Ad-Fc, as a control, at a dose of 1  109 or 4 
109 pfu. To analyze the adenoviral expression of the appropriate transgene,
plasma samples were collected after anesthesia from the tail vein of mice
7 d after adenoviral injection, and 1 AL of plasma was analyzed by Western
blot with rabbit anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were
developed with rabbit-anti-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (New England Biolabs) and detected by chemiluminescence. Equal loading was
determined by using a primary antibody specific to mouse glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Advanced Immunochemical; ref. 32).
Drugs. AG-013736 (Axitinib), a potent small-molecule inhibitor of
VEGFRs, was supplied by Pfizer Global Research and Development. AG013736 was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight in a volume
of 5 AL/g twice daily by gavage for 7 d (39). Imatinib (Gleevec, Novartis
Pharma), an inhibitor of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including
PDGFR-a, PDGFR-h, v-Abl, and c-Kit, was purchased from the UCSF
Pharmacy and administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight in a volume
of 5 AL/g twice daily by gavage for 7 d. Same dosages of AG-013736 and
imatinib were used for the combination treatment.
Estimate of tumor size. At the end of the treatments, the weight (in
milligrams) of LLC tumors was recorded. In RIP-Tag2 tumors, the treatment
effect on tumor size after treatment was assessed in 80-Am-thick cryostat
sections stained for CD31 immunoreactivity. Digital fluorescence microscopic images of all tumors visible in any of three sections cut at different
levels of each pancreas were captured (5 objective, 1 Optovar, tissue
region 1,920 by 2,560 Am), and then the sectional area of each tumor
(8–20 tumors per mouse) was measured with ImageJ. Tumors too large to
fit into a single image were recorded as multiple images and the data
combined (36).
Fixation by vascular perfusion and immunohistochemistry. Following treatment, mice were fixed by vascular perfusion and the tumors were
processed for and stained by immunohistochemistry as previously
described (36). Endothelial cells were labeled with rat monoclonal antimouse CD31 (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; clone MEC 13.3,
Pharmingen; 1:500) or hamster monoclonal anti-mouse CD31 (clone 2H8,
Chemicon; 1:500). Pericytes were stained with Cy3-conjugated mouse
monoclonal anti–a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA; clone 1A4, Sigma;
1:1,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-chicken desmin (A0611, DAKO; 1:2,000),
rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse NG2 proteoglycan (AB5320, Chemicon;
1:2,000), or rat monoclonal anti–PDGFR-h (clone APB5, e-Bioscience;
1:2,000). VEGF was stained with goat polyclonal anti-mouse VEGF antibody
(1:400, R&D Systems, Inc.) that recognizes mouse VEGF164 and VEGF120.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

PDGF was stained with goat polyclonal anti-PDGF antibody (Upstate
Biotechnology; 1:500) that recognizes mouse PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, and
PDGF-BB. Macrophages were stained with rat monoclonal anti-mouse F4/
80 antibody (Serotec; 1:500) and rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse Iba1 antibody
(Wako; 1:1,000).
Imaging and analysis. Specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot
fluorescence microscope and a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal
microscope. Area densities were calculated from digital fluorescence
microscopic images using an empirically determined threshold value of
30 to 50 as previously described (36). In each experiment, five mice per
group were analyzed.
Reverse transcription-PCR methods. Total RNA was isolated from
f50 mg of tumor tissue using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA yield
and purity were determined by spectrophotometry. cDNA synthesis was
done with 1 Ag of total RNA using the cDNA synthesis kit (Roche).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done using SYBR
GreenER qPCR Supermix (Invitrogen) using a Bio-Rad MyIQ detection
system. Expression of each target gene was normalized to the expression of
the control gene b-actin. Primer sequences are available on request.
Statistical analysis. Values are expressed as means F SE (minimum of
n = 5 mice per group). The significance of differences among groups was
assessed using ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni-Dunn or Fisher test for
multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Greater effect on RIP-Tag2 tumor area and vasculature by
inhibiting VEGF and PDGF together than inhibiting either one
alone. Systemic production of the sVEGFR-1 and sPDGFR-h was
confirmed by the presence of a strong band for His-Tag in the
plasma of RIP-Tag2 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1). His-Tag
sVEGFR-1 and PDGFR-h had a robust signal after injection of
Ad-VEGFR1 and Ad-PDGFRh but was not present after control
virus (Ad-Fc; Supplementary Fig. S1).
In RIP-Tag2 mice, treatment with combination of Ad-VEGFR1
and Ad-PDGFRh resulted in a 63% decrease in tumor areas
compared with vehicle-treated mice (0.68 F 0.14 versus 1.85 F 0.19
mm2). After Ad-VEGFR1 treatment, the tumor sectional areas were
reduced by 37% (1.16 F 0.07 versus 1.85 F 0.19 mm2). No reduction
was observed after Ad-PDGFRh treatment for 7 days (Fig. 1A).
RIP-Tag2 tumors were densely vascular under baseline conditions (Fig. 1B-i). After treatment with Ad-VEGFR1 and AdPDGFRh for 7 days, tumor vascularity was reduced by 75%, as
reflected by confocal microscopic images (Fig. 1B-ii) and measurements of CD31-positive endothelial cells (Fig. 1B-iii). A similar
reduction in CD31 area density was observed after treatment with
Ad-VEGFR1 alone (75% reduction), whereas treatment with AdPDGFRh did not change the overall vascularity of RIP-Tag2 tumors
(Fig. 1B-iii).
Next we analyzed the effects of blocking VEGF and PDGF
signaling by using the tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG-013736 and
imatinib. Combination treatment of AG-013736 and imatinib for 7
days reduced the vasculature of RIP-Tag2 tumors by 70%, whereas
AG-013736 alone caused a 53% reduction. Imatinib did not
decrease the blood vessels density of RIP-Tag2 tumors (Fig. 1D-i).
Pericytes identified by a-SMA immunoreactivity were abundant
in untreated RIP-Tag2 tumors (Fig. 1C-i). Ad-PDGFRh and AdVEGFR1 administered together caused a 75% decrease in a-SMA–
positive pericytes (Fig. 1C-ii and C-iii). This reduction was greater
than that observed after treatment with Ad-PDGFRh (40%
reduction) or Ad-VEGFR1 (50% reduction) alone (Fig. 1C-iii).
To determine whether the reduction of a-SMA–positive
pericytes corresponded to a reduction in pericyte number or to a

Tumor-Specific Effects of Inhibiting VEGF and/or PDGF

down-regulation of marker expression, we analyzed three different
pericyte markers: desmin, NG2 proteoglycan (NG2), and PDGFR-h
(23). Desmin-, NG2-, and PDGFR-h–positive pericytes were
abundant in the vehicle-treated RIP-Tag2 tumors (Fig. 2A). The
combination treatment reduced desmin immunoreactivity by 70%
(Fig. 2B and D-iii), NG2 immunoreactivity by 50% (Fig. 2B and Diii), and PDGFR-h immunoreactivity by 50% (Fig. 2D-iii). Surprisingly, treatment with Ad-VEGFR1 alone had only small effects on
desmin (20% reduction), NG2 (4% reduction), and PDGFR-h (10%
reduction; Fig. 2C). These results suggested that in RIP-Tag2
tumors, inhibition of the VEGF signaling pathway did not
significantly affect the number of pericytes. As expected, AdPDGFRh treatment alone significantly reduced pericyte number
(Fig. 2D), with reductions ranging from 40% to 53%, depending on
the marker (Fig. 2D-iii).
Similar effects were observed after treatment with AG-013736
and imatinib. Indeed, combination of AG-013736 and imatinib

reduced all the four pericyte markers analyzed by 50% to 70%
(Fig. 1D-ii; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Imatinib alone decreased all
of them by 30% to 50% whereas AG-013736 treatment reduced
a-SMA (50% reduction) and desmin (50% reduction), but not
NG2 and PDGFR-h area density (Supplementary Fig. S2A). These
data confirmed that in RIP-Tag2 tumors, inhibition of the VEGF
signaling pathway did not significantly affect the number of
pericytes.
Equal effect on LLC tumor size and vasculature by
inhibiting VEGF or PDGF alone as inhibiting both together.
We then investigated the effect of monotherapy and combination
therapy in LLC tumors. Systemic production of sVEGFR-1 and
sPDGFR-h after treatment with Ad-VEGFR1 and Ad-PDGFRh was
confirmed by Western blot (data not shown).
In LLC tumors, treatment with Ad-VEGFR1 and Ad-PDGFRh
alone or in combination reduced the tumor size to a similar extent
(40% reduction; Fig. 3A).

Ad-VEGFR1 and Ad-PDGFRh for 7 d
reduced RIP-Tag2 tumor area significantly
more than did Ad-VEGFR1 or Ad-PDGFRh
treatment alone (A ). Confocal micrographs

immunoreactivity) of RIP-Tag2 tumor under
baseline conditions (B-i ) and pruned

Analysis of CD31 area density shows that
combination treatment reduced blood
vessels to the same extent as did
Ad-VEGFR1 alone and that Ad-PDGFRh
alone did not affect the tumor vasculature
in RIP-Tag2 tumors (B-iii ). The combined
viral vectors reduced a-SMA–positive
pericytes in RIP-Tag2 tumors (C-i and C-ii).
Measurement revealed that all treatments
reduced the area density of a-SMA, but
the combination of Ad-VEGFR1 and
Ad-PDGFRh caused the greatest decrease
(C-iii). Combination of AG-013736 and
imatinib decreased the CD31 area density
more than did AG-013736 treatment alone
whereas imatinib did not change the
blood vessels in RIP-Tag2 tumors (D-i ).
AG-013736 and imatinib combined reduced
a-SMA–positive pericytes significantly
more than did AG-013736 or imatinib alone

Figure 2. Different effects on pericytes in
RIP-Tag2 tumors by inhibiting VEGF and/or
PDGF. Confocal microscopic images of
Ad-Fc–treated RIP-Tag2 tumors stained for
CD31 (green ) and desmin (A-i ) or NG2
(A-ii ; red ). After treatment with combination
of Ad-VEGFR1 and Ad-PDGFRh, a few
desmin-positive (B-i ) or NG2-positive (B-ii )
pericytes remained. The area density
measurements revealed that desmin was
reduced by 70%, PDGFR-h by 50%, and
NG2 by 50% (D-iii ). Treatment with
Ad-VEGFR1 for 7 d significantly decreased
desmin-positive (C-i ), but not NG2- and
PDGFR-h–positive (C-ii and D-iii ),
pericytes. Ad-PDGFRh for 7 d reduced the
immunoreactivities of desmin by 45% (D-i
and D-iii ), NG2 by 52% (D-ii and D-iii), and
PDGFR-h by 40% (D-iii ). *, P < 0.05,
compared with Ad-Fc. Scale bar in D-ii
applies to all images: 115 Am.

The combined viral vectors Ad-VEGFR1 and Ad-PDGFRh caused
a 65% reduction in vascularity of LLC tumors (Fig. 3B). Ad-VEGFR1
alone reduced blood vessels to a similar extent (50%; Fig. 3B-iii).
Interestingly, in LLC, in contrast to RIP-Tag2 tumors, treatment
with Ad-PDGFRh alone was sufficient to cause a 60% reduction in
vascularity (Fig. 3B-iii).
Combination of AG-013736 and imatinib decreased the blood
vessel density of LLC tumors by 60% (Fig. 3D-i). A similar reduction
was induced by AG-013736 or imatinib treatment alone (Fig. 3D-i).
In LLC tumors, a-SMA–positive pericytes (Fig. 3C-i) were
severely reduced after combination of Ad-VEGFR1 and AdPDGFRh (78% reduction; Fig. 3C-ii and iii). Treatment with AdVEGFR1 reduced a-SMA by 60% and treatment with Ad-PDGFRh
decreased a-SMA immunoreactivity by 70% (Fig. 3C-iii).
The analysis of desmin, NG2, and PDGFR-h immunoreactivities
revealed that in LLC tumors, combination of Ad-VEGFR1 and Ad-

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

PDGFRh reduced them by roughly the same extent (75% reduction;
Fig. 4B and D-iii). In LLC, in contrast to RIP-Tag2 tumors, AdVEGFR1 significantly decreased all the markers, ranging in amount
from 48% to 59% (Fig. 4C and D-iii), suggesting a decrease in terms
of pericyte numbers. As expected, pericyte numbers were also
severely reduced after Ad-PDGFRh (Fig. 4D), reflecting 75% to 78%
reductions in immunoreactivities of the three markers (Fig. 4D-iii).
These findings were confirmed by inhibition of VEGF and PDGF
signaling using AG-013736 and imatinib. Indeed, AG-013736 and
imatinib either alone or combined significantly reduced all four
pericyte markers (Fig. 3D-ii; Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Different cellular locations and levels of VEGF and PDGF in
RIP-Tag2 and LLC tumors. The previous data illustrated that
VEGF inhibition alone reduced the number of pericytes in LLC but
not in RIP-Tag2 tumors. In addition, PDGF inhibition alone
reduced vascularity in LLC but not in RIP-Tag2 tumors. To

Tumor-Specific Effects of Inhibiting VEGF and/or PDGF

understand why RIP-Tag2 tumors were less sensitive to monotherapy compared with LLC tumors, we analyzed the level and
localization of VEGF and PDGF in the two tumor models.
In RIP-Tag2 tumors, the overall VEGF expression was higher
than in LLC tumors. Indeed VEGF immunoreactivity was present in
and around the tumor cells (Fig. 5A-i). In contrast, in LLC tumors,
most VEGF-positive cells were located near endothelial cells (Fig.
5A-ii). The analysis of VEGF area density revealed that in RIP-Tag2
tumor, VEGF immunoreactivity was 10-fold higher compared with
LLC (Fig. 5A-iii). This result was confirmed by VEGF mRNA
analysis. The level of VEGF-A mRNA was more than 100 times
higher in RIP-Tag2 tumors than in LLC (Fig. 5A-iv). Immunostaining experiments revealed that the VEGF-positive cells expressed
the three pericyte markers a-SMA (Fig. 5B-i), PDGFR-h, and NG2
(Supplementary Fig. S3A), suggesting that pericytes are the main
source of VEGF in LLC tumors.

Macrophages are a well-described source of VEGF (40); to asses
if macrophage expressed VEGF in LLC tumors, we stained tumor
sections with two different macrophage markers, F4/80 and Iba1.
The staining revealed that very little VEGF immunoreactivity was
present in F4/80- and Iba1-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
To confirm our hypothesis that the different effects of VEGF and
PDGF inhibition depend on the level and distribution of VEGF
expression, we analyzed the effects of inhibiting VEGF and PDGF
together or alone on a different clone of LLC tumor (LLCx)
previously described to express high amount of VEGF (33). Indeed,
in LLCx, VEGF immunoreactivity was significantly higher compared with LLC tumors (Fig. 5B-ii and iii). By mRNA analysis, we
found that the level of VEGF-A mRNA was more than 10 times
higher in LLCx than in LLC tumors (Fig. 5C-i). Considering this
difference, we asked whether LLCx had a different sensitivity to
monotherapy and combined therapy compared with LLC tumors.

Figure 3. Combination of VEGF and
PDGF inhibition reduced tumor size,
vascularity, and a-SMA–positive pericytes
in LLC tumors. Treatment with Ad-VEGFR1
and Ad-PDGFRh alone or combined
reduced the weight of LLC tumors by 45%
(A). Vascularity was more sparse in LLC
tumors (B-i ) than in RIP-Tag2 tumors under
baseline conditions and was reduced
after Ad-VEGFR1 in combination with
Ad-PDGFRh (B-ii ). Bar graph shows
comparable reduction in CD31
immunoreactivities after combination,
Ad-VEGFR1, or Ad-PDGFRh treatment for
7 d (B-iii ). Similarly, a-SMA–positive
pericytes were significantly decreased after
combination treatment (C-i and iii ). The
measurements of a-SMA area density
showed that the combination,
Ad-PDGFRh, or Ad-VEGFR1 treatment
caused a similar reduction (C-iii ).
AG-013736 and imatinib treatment
combined or alone reduced the CD31 area
density and a-SMA area density to similar
extent (D). *, P < 0.05, compared with

Figure 4. Combination treatment reduced
pericytes in LLC tumors to the same
extent as did Ad-VEGFR1 or Ad-PDGFRh
alone. In LLC tumors, desmin and NG2 (A)
immunoreactivity was decreased after
combined viral vector treatment (B ), after
Ad-VEGFR1 (C ), or after Ad-PDGFRh (D ).
Measurements of desmin, PDGFR-h, and
NG2 immunoreactivities confirmed the
comparable reductions of all these markers
after all treatments (D-iii ). *, P < 0.05,
compared with Ad-Fc group. Scale bar in
D-ii applies to all images: 110 Am.

In LLCx, treatment with combination induced a greater reduction
of tumor blood vessels (82%) compared with single treatment
(Fig. 5C-ii). Indeed, in LLCx, Ad-VEFGR1 reduced the tumor vessel
density by 70% (Fig. 5C-ii). Moreover, in LLCx, treatment with AdPDGFRh alone caused a significantly smaller reduction of the
tumor vasculature (30% reduction) compared with that observed in
LLC (60% reduction; Fig. 5C-ii). These results confirmed that PDGF
inhibition had less effect on tumor vessels in tumors with high
VEGF expression.
We then investigated the expression level and localization
of PDGF. The overall level of PDGF immunoreactivity was
higher in RIP-Tag2 tumors than in LLC. In RIP-Tag2 tumors,
PDGF immunoreactivity was widely distributed in tumor cells
(Fig. 5D-i) with some PDGF-positive blood vessels (Fig. 5D-i,
arrows). In contrast, PDGF immunoreactivity was mainly restricted
to endothelial cells in LLC tumors (Fig. 5D-ii). Measurements
of PDGF area density revealed that PDGF immunoreactivity was

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

3-fold higher in RIP-Tag2 tumors than in LLC (Fig. 5D-iii). Different
isoforms of PDGF are frequently present in tumors (41). Because
the antibody used for the staining recognized PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB,
and PDGF-BB, by quantitative RT-PCR, we analyzed the mRNA
expression levels of PDGF-A and PDGF-B in both tumor types. Our
data showed that PDGF-A and PDGF-B mRNA levels were 2.5- and
7.0-fold higher, respectively, in RIP-Tag2 tumors compared with
LLC tumors (Fig. 5D-iv; Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Different plasticity of VEGF and PDGF in RIP-Tag2 and LLC

responsiveness of RIP-Tag2 tumors and LLC tumors to monotherapy and combination therapy were due to differences in the
level and localization of VEGF and PDGF expression. Levels of
VEGF and PDGF were analyzed in both tumor types after inhibition
of VEGF or PDGF signaling.

treatment (area density, 19 F 2%), but it was not noticeably altered
after Ad-PDGFRh treatment (Fig. 6A). By comparison, in LLC
tumors, the sparsely distributed VEGF immunoreactivity (area
density, 9 F 1%) was significantly reduced by f70% after either AdVEGFR1 or Ad-PDGFRh treatment (Fig. 6B). The number of VEGFpositive cells (identified as pericytes) was conspicuously reduced in
LLC tumors after Ad-VEGFR1 or Ad-PDGFRh treatment (Fig. 6B).
In RIP-Tag2 tumors, the extensive PDGF immunoreactivity was
reduced by 88% after PDGF inhibition but was not significantly
affected by VEGF inhibition (Fig. 6C). However, in LLC, sequestration of VEGF decreased by 60% the level of PDGF. The number of
PDGF-positive cells (identified as endothelial cells) was drastically
reduced after Ad-sVEGFR1 or Ad-PDGFRh treatment (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The present study sought to dissect the effects of combined
blockage of VEGF and PDGF signaling on tumor blood vessels in

two mouse tumor models, RIP-Tag2 tumors and LLC tumors. We
found that combination of Ad-VEGFR1 and Ad-PDGFRh strongly
reduced tumor size, blood vessels, and pericytes in both tumor
models. In RIP-Tag2 tumors, single Ad-VEGFR1 or Ad-PDGFRh
treatment caused a lower reduction in tumor area, blood vessels,
and pericytes compared with the combination treatment. In
contrast, in LLC tumors, blocking VEGF or PDGF signaling alone
reduced tumor size, pericytes, and endothelial cell density to the
same extent as did the combination treatment. Similar results were
observed by inhibition of VEGF and PDGF signaling using the
tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG-013736 and imatinib.
Pericytes in tumors are loosely associated with endothelial cells
and have cytoplasmic processes that extend away from the vessel
wall (12, 42). Pericytes express different markers in different organs
and tumors (12, 43, 44). The lack of a single unique marker for all
pericytes presents a challenge for their identification. The absence
of a marker could reflect absence of expression by pericytes or
absence of pericytes. In the present study, to assess the presence of

reduced blood vessels significantly more
than did Ad-VEGFR1 or Ad-PDGFRh alone
in LLCx tumors (C-ii ). In RIP-Tag2 tumors,
most PDGF immunoreactivity was in tumor
cells (D-i ) and endothelial cells (D-i,

of RIP-Tag2 tumors show that the strong
VEGF immunoreactivity (red) after Ad-Fc
(A-i ) was reduced after Ad-VEGFR1
(A-ii ), whereas after Ad-PDGFRh it was
unchanged (A-iii and A-iv ). By comparison,
VEGF immunoreactive cells were much
less abundant in control LLC tumors
(Ad-Fc) and even sparser after

RIP-Tag2 tumors and was equally strong
after Ad-Fc (C-i ) and Ad-VEGFR1 (C-ii ) but
was reduced by Ad-PDGFRh treatment
(C-iii and C-iv ). LLC tumors had fewer

even less after Ad-VEGFR1 (D-ii ) or

pericytes, we used four markers: a-SMA, desmin, NG2, and PDGFRh (23). Pericytes in RIP-Tag2 tumors and LLC tumors expressed all
four markers, with minor differences in cellular localization due to
the association of a-SMA and desmin with the cytoskeleton and of
NG2 and PDGFR-h with the plasma membrane. By looking at these
four markers, we found that Ad-VEGFR1 as well as AG-013736 did
not affect the overall number of pericytes in RIP-Tag2 tumors but
reduced the amount of a-SMA and desmin immunoreactivity.
Because many blood vessels regressed in these tumors after VEGF
signaling inhibition, many pericytes were left without endothelial
cells. The reduction in the two cytoskeletal markers may be a
consequence of the reorganization of the pericyte cytoskeleton,
which could occur after loss of contact with endothelial cells.
Treatment with Ad-PDGFRh led to pericyte loss in both RIP-Tag2
tumors and LLC tumors, but the reduction was much greater in
LLC tumors. In RIP-Tag2 tumors, the combined adenoviral vectors
had a complex effect on pericytes, involving loss of about half of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

the pericyte population and change in phenotype of the remaining
pericytes, as reflected by decreased expression of a-SMA. LLC
tumors differed in this regard from RIP-Tag2 tumors. In LLC
tumors, the combined viral vectors reduced by 75% pericyte density
detected by all four markers, a reduction comparable to the one
obtained by treatment with Ad-VEGFR1 or Ad-PDGFRh alone.
After combination of Ad-PDGFRh and Ad-VEGFR1, almost all
the surviving blood vessels were associated with pericytes. It has
been reported that in RIP-Tag2 tumors, after blocking PDGFR and
VEGFR with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors SU5416 and imatinib or
SU5416 and SU6668, the remaining blood vessels were covered by
few pericytes (24). These differences could be attributed to the
following reasons: the different specificities of the inhibitors used,
the duration of the treatment, and the stage of the tumors
analyzed.
The difference in responsiveness between RIP-Tag2 tumors and
LLC tumors could be attributed to the level and/or localization of

VEGF and PDGF expression. Indeed, RIP-Tag2 tumors had
significantly higher VEGF and PDGF transcript levels and
immunoreactivity compared with LLC tumors. By analyzing the
distribution of VEGF within tumors, we found that both tumor
cells and pericytes produced VEGF in RIP-Tag2 tumors. Those
results are in line with previous studies showing that VEGF is
highly expressed in the tumor cells of tumorigenic islets as well as
in the normal islets in RIP-Tag2 mice (45–47). Our data suggest that
in RIP-Tag2 tumors, the cellular sources targeted by the AdVEGFR1 treatment are mainly the tumor cells, and that these are
responsible for the reduction of the endothelial cells. This
hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that the elimination of
pericytes by Ad-PDGFRh did not lead to reduction of tumor blood
vessels.
In contrast, in LLC tumor, VEGF immunoreactivity was located
in cells close to blood vessels, and most of these cells were
immunoreactive to pericyte markers. VEGF production has been
previously described in the ovary pericytes (48), and pericytes
isolated from RIP-Tag2 tumors have high VEGF transcription level
(25). In addition, previous studies have shown that pericytes
facilitate the maintenance of endothelial cells by secreting growth
factors (10, 13, 16) such as VEGF (16). Macrophages have been
described to be an important source of VEGF (42). In LLC tumors,
double staining with VEGF and macrophage markers showed that
only few macrophages were positive for VEGF. Similarly, VEGF
immunoreactivity was not observed in LLC tumor cells. We cannot
rule out that VEGF was not expressed in these cells, but the fact
that the amount was too little to be detectable by immunohistochemistry suggests that in LLC tumor, pericytes are the major
source of VEGF.
Interestingly, when we analyzed the effects of VEGF and PDGF
inhibition in a LLC tumor line expressing high amount of VEGF,
LLCx tumors, we found that combination therapy had a greater
effect compared with single treatment. Moreover, PDGF blockage
induced only a small reduction of the blood vessel density. These
findings supported our hypothesis that the amount and distribution of VEGF determine the effects of PDGF inhibition on tumor
blood vessels.
Endothelial cells in RIP-Tag2 tumors express genes for PDGF-A
and PDGF-B (24). In our experiments, both tumor cells and
endothelial cells produced PDGF in RIP-Tag2 tumors whereas only
endothelial cells produced PDGF in LLC tumors.
These findings suggest that VEGF and PDGF inhibitors affect
blood vessels differently depending on the amount and cellular
distribution of VEGF and PDGF within the tumor. Our model is

that in LLC tumors, PDGF inhibition affects blood vessels by first
eliminating pericytes, the major source of VEGF; similarly, VEGF
inhibition reduces the number of pericytes by targeting and
eliminating endothelial cells, the major source of PDGF. This model
is consistent with our results showing that in LLC tumors,
inhibition of VEGF strongly reduced PDGF immunoreactivity and
inhibition of PDGF strongly reduced VEGF immunoreactivity.
In RIP-Tag2 tumors, where tumor cells produce both VEGF and
PDGF, targeting endothelial cells via VEGF inhibition did not lead
to a reduction in pericytes because PDGF was unaffected. Similarly,
targeting pericytes by PDGF inhibition did not affect endothelial
cells because VEGF was unaffected. Our results illustrated that
PDGF inhibitors can have effects on tumor vessels similar to those
of VEGF inhibitors but only in tumors where pericytes are the main
source of VEGF. Future experiments in other tumor models will
broaden our findings.
In conclusion, the present study highlights the importance of
VEGF and PDGF signaling in sustaining the tumor vasculature. Our
results also illustrate that tumor vasculature can respond to VEGF
and/or PDGF inhibition differently depending on the cellular
source and amount of growth factors within the tumor. These
findings emphasize the importance of the tumor phenotype in the
responsiveness to inhibitors of VEGF and PDGF. A better
understanding of the interaction of factors from endothelial cells,
pericytes, and other tumor compartments is required to design the
most effective antitumor therapy.
