Abstract
This study was aimed at elucidating the mechanism by which
FTY720, a synthetic sphingosine immunosuppressant, mediated antitumor effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
cells. The three HCC cell lines examined, Hep3B, Huh7, and
PLC5, exhibited differential susceptibility to FTY720-mediated
suppression of cell viability, with IC50 values of 4.5, 6.3, and 11
Mmol/L, respectively. Although FTY720 altered the phosphorylation state of protein kinase B and p38, our data refuted
the role of these two signaling kinases in FTY720-mediated
apoptosis. Evidence indicates that the antitumor effect of
FTY720 was attributable to its ability to stimulate reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production, which culminated in protein kinase C (PKC)D activation and subsequent caspase3–dependent apoptosis. We showed that FTY720 activated
PKCD through two distinct mechanisms: phosphorylation and
caspase-3–dependent cleavage. Cotreatment with the caspase3 inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK abrogated the effect of FTY720 on
facilitating PKCD proteolysis. Equally important, pharmacologic inhibition or shRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCD
protected FTY720-treated Huh7 cells from caspase-3 activation. Moreover, FTY720 induced ROS production to different
extents among the three cell lines, in the order of Hep3B >
Huh7 >> PLC5, which inversely correlated with the respective
glutathione S-transferase P expression levels. The low level of
ROS generation might underlie the resistant phenotype of
PLC5 cells to the apoptotic effects of FTY720. Blockade of ROS
production by an NADPH oxidase inhibitor protected Huh7
cells from FTY720-induced PKCD activation and caspase-3–
dependent apoptosis. Together, this study provides a rationale
to use FTY720 as a scaffold to develop potent PKCD-activating
agents for HCC therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(4):1204–12]

Introduction
FTY720 is a synthetic sphingosine immunosuppressant, which is
currently undergoing clinical trials for the prevention of kidney
graft rejection (1) and the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis
(2). Previous studies indicate that the effect of FTY720 on
prolonging the survival of allografts is attributable to the ability
of its phosphorylated metabolite to inhibit T-lymphocyte infiltration by targeting several of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)
receptors (3, 4). In addition to immunosuppression, FTY720 has

also been shown to induce apoptosis in several human cancer cell
lines, including Jurkat T cells (5), multiple myeloma cells (6), and
those of liver (7, 8), prostate (9–12), breast (13), kidney (14), and
bladder (15). This antitumor effect is noteworthy because of the
involvement of S1P receptor–independent mechanisms (16). To
date, a number of signaling pathways have been proposed to
account for the ability of FTY720 to facilitate apoptosis in different
cancer cell lines, including those mediated by protein kinase B
(Akt) (5, 6, 8), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (6, 10),
focal adhesion kinase (10), Rho-GTPase (12), signal transducers and
activators of transcription 3, InBa, nuclear factor-nB, and Bcl-xL
(6). Mechanistically, the targeting of this wide spectrum of signaling
elements underscores the effectiveness of FTY720 in suppressing
cell growth in a broad range of cancer cells that exhibit distinct
mechanisms in governing cell cycle progression and apoptosis.
Hepatocellular cancer occurs both sporadically and is also
related to chronic viral infection, environmental exposure, and
alternative causes of hepatic cirrhosis. The US Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results database estimates that 19,160
men and women will be diagnosed with and 16,780 men and
women will die of cancer of the liver and intrahepatic bile duct in
2007 within the United States (17). The incidence of hepatocellular
carcinoma is even higher in the Asian cultures due to the higher
frequency of chronic active viral hepatitis. Until only recently,
effective treatment of hepatocellular cancer has been essentially
absent (18). Recently, the RAF inhibitor sornafinib has been shown
to be beneficial for the treatment of metastatic hepatocellular
carcinoma and was approved for marketing by the Food and Drug
Administration in this indication (19). However, this therapy only
works in a subset of patients and is not curative. This emphasizes
both the potential for multitargeted kinase inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma and the need to identify new therapies.
In this study, we describe a novel mechanism by which FTY720
induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC). We
obtain evidence that FTY720 facilitates reactive oxygen species
(ROS)-dependent activation of protein kinase C y (PKCy), resulting
in caspase-3–mediated apoptotic death in HCC cells. PKCy, a
member of the novel PKC subfamily, has been shown to play a
pivotal role in mediating apoptosis induced by oxidative stress
(20, 21), Fas ligands (22), and various genotoxic agents including
DNA damaging agents (23) and paclitaxel (24), thereby representing
an important target for cancer therapy. Consequently, this mechanistic finding provides a molecular basis to pharmacologically
exploit FTY720 to develop potent PKCy-targeted antitumor agents.

Materials and Methods

high-solution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The following
pharmacologic agents were purchased from the respective vendors: okadaic
acid, PD98059, SB203580, Ro6976, rottlerin, and U3122 (Calbiochem);
diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI; Cayman Chemical); 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA; Invitrogen); (Ac-DMQD)2-Rh110 (Anaspec);
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT;
TCI America). Cell death detection ELISA kit and the NE-PER Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit were obtained from Roche
Diagnostic and Pierce, respectively. Antibodies against various proteins
were obtained from the following sources: PKCa, PKCq, PKCf, PKCy,
p-Tyr155-PKCy, p-Thr507-PKCy, and p-Thr308-Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p-Tyr311-PKCy, p-Ser664-PKCy (Abcam); Akt and p-Ser473-Akt (Cell
Signaling); glutathione S-transferase (GST)-k (DAKO). The pKD-PKCy-v2
plasmid encoding shRNA against PKCy, goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) conjugates, and rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugates
was purchased from Upstate.
Cell culture. Huh7, PLC5, and Hep3B human HCC cell lines were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured
in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 Ag/mL
gentamicin at 37jC in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Culture
medium was replaced every 2 days.
MTT assay. Cell viability was assessed by using the MTT assay in six
replicates. HCC cells were seeded at 3  105 per well in 24-well flatbottomed plates and incubated in 10% FBS–supplemented DMEM for 24 h.
Cells were treated with FTY720 at various concentrations in the same
medium. Controls received DMSO vehicle at a concentration equal to that
in drug-treated cells. After 24 h, the drug-containing medium was replaced
with 200 AL of 10% FBS–supplemented DMEM containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT,
and cells were incubated in the CO2 incubator at 37jC for 4 h. Medium was
removed, the reduced MTT was solubilized in 500 AL per well of DMSO, and
100 AL aliquots from each well was transfer to 96-well plates to measure
absorbance at 570 nm.
Annexin V/propidium iodide assay. For assessment of apoptosis, both
floating and adherent cells were collected and analyzed. Briefly, f7  105
cells per dish were plated onto 10-cm dishes and incubated at 37jC for 16 h.
The cells were treated with DMSO or 10 Amol/L FTY720 for the time
indicated. The cells were washed twice with PBS and collected by
trypsinization. After centrifugation at 400  g for 5 min at room
temperature, the cells were stained with Annexin V and propidium iodide
(1 Ag/mL). The cell apoptosis distributions were determined on a FACScort
flow cytometer and analyzed by ModFitLT V3.0 software program.
Western blotting. Cells, seeded in 10-cm dishes (7  105 cells per dish),
were incubated for 16 h, subjected to different drug treatments, and
harvested by scrapping. Cell lysates were prepared by exposing cells to 2 
SDS lysis buffer [0.1 mol/L Tris, 0.4% SDS, and 20% glycerol (pH 6.8)].
Protein concentrations of cell lysates were measured using a Micro BCA
protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). To the cell lysate, the same volume of
SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer [100 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 5%
h-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue (pH 6.8)] was
added, and the cells were boiled for 10 min. Equal amounts of proteins were
resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gel was
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer cell. The
transblotted membrane was washed twice with TBS containing 0.1% Tween
20 (TBST). After blocking with TBST containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h, the
membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody in 1%
TBST nonfat milk at 4jC overnight. The membrane was washed thrice with
TBST for a total of 15 min. The secondary anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugates
or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugates (1:2,000 dilution) was subsequently
incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature and was washed
extensively for 50 min with TBST. The blots were visualized with the
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) Western blot detection system
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell death detection ELISA assay. Induction of apoptosis was assessed
with a Cell Death Detection ELISA kit, which is based on the quantitative
determination of cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA fragments in the
form of mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes after induced apoptotic
death. In brief, Huh7 cells (5  104) were seeded and incubated in 96-well

www.aacrjournals.org

plates containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 16 h and were
then subjected to various drug treatments for 24 h. After incubation, the
plates were centrifuged at 200  g for 10 min and incubated with 200 AL of
lysis buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Twenty microliters of
supernatant from each sample were used in the ELISA by following the
manufacturer’s instruction.
Detection of ROS. DCFDA is an indicator for ROS that is nonfluorescent
until its acetate groups are removed by intracellular esterases and oxidation
occurs in the cell. The ROS production in Huh7 cells after FTY720 treatment
was detected using 5 Amol/L DCFDA. Huh7 cells (7  105) in 10 cm-dishes
were treated with FTY720 for 1 h, washed with PBS twice, and then exposed
to 5 Amol/L DCFDA for 30 min at 37jC. Cells were collected and analyzed
by flow cytometry.
Detection of hydrogen peroxide. Quantitative determination of
hydrogen peroxide in the culture medium was performed by using a
colorimetric hydrogen peroxide kit (Assay Designs, Inc.) according to the
vendor’s instruction. In brief, Huh7 cells (7  105) were seeded and incubated
in 10-cm plates containing 10% FBS–supplemented DMEM for 16 h. Because
the culture medium would interfere with the detection of hydrogen peroxide,
it was replaced with an equal volume of Hanks’ balanced Salt Solution
(HBSS) containing 10 Amol/L FTY720. After 3-h of exposure, 50 AL of the
cultured HBSS solution was incubated with 100 AL of the colorimetric
solution provided in the kit in 96-well plates, and incubated at room
temperature for 30 min. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured.
ShRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCA, PKCE, and PKCD. Huh7 cells
(1  106) were cotransfected with 1.8 Ag of individual shRNA plasmids
(pKD-PKCa-v4, pKD-PKCy-v2, and pKD-PKCq-v5) and 0.2 Ag of pCDNA 3.1
(+) plasmids using Invitrogen Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were then selected by G418 for 2 weeks. The
stable clones were established and confirmed by Western blotting using
individual antibodies against PKCa, PKCq, and PKCy.
Ectopic expression of constitutively active Akt. The pcDNA 3.1
(+)/CA-Akt-HA plasmid that encodes AktT308D/S473D, a constitutively active
form of Akt, was provided by Dr. Matthew D. Ringel (The Ohio State
University, Columbus, OH). Huh7 cells were transfected via nucleofection by
using program T-022 of the AMAXA Nucleofector system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Expression of constitutively active Akt was
confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies against Akt and
hemagglutinin tag.
Subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was performed
using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit according
to the manufacturer’s instruction. In brief, Huh7 (7  105) cells in 10-cm
dishes were exposed to 10 Amol/L FTY720 in 10% FBS–containing DMEM
for different time intervals. After treatment, the cells were washed with
cold PBS, scraped, and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were
suspended in 200 AL of Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent I solution and
incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by adding 11 AL of Cytoplasmic
Extraction Reagent II solution and incubation on ice for 1 min. The
cell suspensions were centrifuged at 16,000  g for 5 min to collect
supernatant as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellets were resuspended with
100 AL of Nuclear Extraction Reagent on ice for 40 min. The cell suspension
was centrifuged at 16,000  g for 10 min at 4jC to collect supernatant as
the nuclear fraction.
Analysis of caspase-3 activity. Caspase-3 activity was determined using
(Ac-DMQD)2-Rh110 as the fluorogenic substrate for active caspase-3.
Briefly, Huh7 (7  105) cells in 10-cm dishes were subjected to different drug
treatments for 24 h and were resuspended in 100 AL of PBS containing
10 Amol/L 2-Rh110 for 15 min at room temperature. Each sample was then
added with 400 AL PBS, and fluorescence signals generated by caspase-3–
cleaved substrate were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Cytochrome c release. Drug-treated Huh7 cells were collected and
triturated with 100 AL of chilled hypotonic lysis solution [220 mmol/L
mannitol, 68 mmol/L sucrose, 50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L
MgCl2, and 1 mmol/L DTT in 50 mmol/L PIPES-KOH (pH 7.4)] for 45 min.
The solution was centrifuged at 600  g for 10 min to collect the
supernatant. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for
30 min, and equal amounts of proteins (50 Ag) from the supernatant were

resolved in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by immunoblotting with anticytochrome c antibodies.
Statistical analysis. The JMP5.0.1 software package was used to perform
all analyses. Data were analyzed by the Student’s t test. Differences were
considered significant at a P value of <0.05.

Results
Differential susceptibility of HCC cell lines to FTY720induced apoptotic death. The in vitro antitumor efficacy of
FTY720 was evaluated in three human HCC cell lines, Huh7,
Hep3B, and PLC5, which are resistant to cytotoxic drugs due to loss
of p53 function and/or overexpression of Bcl-xL (26). As these three
cell lines harbor different cellular and genetic abnormalities, they
showed differential susceptibility to the antiproliferative effect of
FTY720. The IC50 values for Hep3B, Huh7, and PLC5 cells were 4.5,
6.3, and 11 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 1A). The antiproliferative
activity of FTY720 was, at least in part, attributable to apoptosis, as
evidenced by poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage in each
of these three cell lines and Annexin V/propodium iodide staining
in Huh7 cells in a dose- and/or time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B
and C).
Involvement of PKCD in FTY720-mediated apoptotic death.
To date, various signaling pathways have been reported to account
for FTY720-induced apoptosis in different cancer cell systems,
which might be reconciled by differences in the molecular

abnormalities associated with the oncogenesis of individual cancer
types. Of these proposed mechanisms, the ability of FTY720 to
affect the activation status of p38 MAP kinase and Akt in prostate
cancer cells (10) and HCC cells (8), respectively, was especially
noteworthy.
To discern the role of Akt and p38 in FTY720-mediated apoptosis
in HCC cells, we investigated the effect of FTY720 on the
phosphorylation of these two signaling kinases in Huh7, Hep3B,
and PLC5 cells. As these HCC cell lines contained functional PTEN,
they exhibited low levels of Akt phosphorylation at Ser473
compared with the PTEN-defective PC-3 cancer cells (Fig. 2A). In
contrast, this PTEN functional status had no direct correlation with
the Thr308 phosphorylation, as all these three HCC cell lines
exhibited high levels of p-Thr308-Akt relative to PC-3 (Fig. 2B). This
site-specific phenomenon is consistent with the finding that levels
of PTEN modulate Akt phosphorylation on Ser473, but not on
Thr308, in rhabdomyosarcomas cells (27).
As shown in Fig. 2B, exposure to FTY720 for 24 h led to a dosedependent decrease in p-Thr308-Akt levels in these three HCC cell
lines (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with that previously reported (8).
Moreover, the relative potency in Akt dephosphorylation correlated
with the respective susceptibility to FTY720-induced cell death. In
contrast, the effect of FTY720 on modulating p38 phosphorylation
was cell line specific among the three cell lines examined, i.e., only
PLC5 cells exhibited a dose-dependent increase in p-p38 levels after
drug treatment.

(100 nmol/L), PD98059 (10 Amol/L),
SB203580 (10 Amol/L), Ro6976
(10 Amol/L), rottlerin (10 Amol/L), and

on protecting Huh7 cells against

and cell viability was analyzed by MTT
assay. Columns, mean; bars, FSD (n = 6).
E, rottlerin (10 Amol/L) inhibits the effect of
FTY720 (10 Amol/L) on cytochrome c
(left) and PARP cleavage (right ) in Huh7
cells. Huh7 cells were exposed to
10 Amol/L FTY720 in the presence of
10 Amol/L rottlerin or DMSO vehicle in 10%
FBS–containing DMEM for the indicated
time intervals. Mitochondria-free lysates
and total lysates were prepared as
described in Materials and Methods for the
Western blot analysis of cytochrome c
release and PARP cleavage, respectively.

To further examine whether Akt inhibition represented a major
underlying antitumor mechanism for FTY720, we assessed the
effect of the ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of
Akt (AktT308D/S473D) on FTY720-induced cell death by transiently
transfecting Huh7 cells with HA-CA-Akt plasmids (Fig. 2C). The
constitutively activated status of Akt was manifested by the
multifold increase in the phosphorylation level of GSK3h. However,
this ectopic AktT308D/S473D expression did not provide a significant
protection against the suppression of cell viability by 10 Amol/L
FTY720. Together, these findings argued against the involvement of
Akt and p38 in FTY720-induced apoptosis at least in these two
sensitive cell lines.
To delineate the underlying mechanism, we further assessed the
effect of a panel of pharmacologic inhibitors, including those of
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A; okadaic acid), MAP kinase kinase
(PD98059), p38 kinase (SB203580), PKCa/h (Ro6970), PKCy

(rottlerin), and phospholipase C (U3122) on rescuing Huh7 cell
from FTY720-induced cell death. Some of these signaling enzymes
might potentially be targeted by FTY720 to trigger apoptosis
signaling. For example, a recent report suggests the involvement of
PP2A activation in FTY720-mediated Akt dephosphorylation in a
T-cell–derived leukemia cell line (5). However, of these inhibitors,
only the PKCy inhibitor rottlerin exhibited the ability to counteract
the cell killing activity of 5 Amol/L FTY720, whereas others either
exacerbated or had no appreciable effects on FTY720-mediated
suppression of cell viability (Fig. 2D, left). In addition, rottlerin,
even at 1 Amol/L, was effective in protecting Huh7 cells from the
antitumor activity of FTY720. As PKCy mediates mitochondriadependent apoptosis, cotreatment of Huh7 cells with rottlerin
could block the effect of FTY720 on cytochrome c release into the
cytoplasm and PARP cleavage (Fig. 2E). Consequently, these
findings suggested that PKCy activation played a pivotal role in

FTY720-mediated apoptotic death. It is noteworthy that PKCy was
differentially expressed among the three HCC cell lines (Fig. 3A).
Relative to Huh 7 and Hep3B cells, PLC5 cells exhibited low levels
of PKCy expression, which might, in part, attribute to their relative
insensitivity to FTY720-induced apoptosis.
Role of PKCD in FTY720-induced apoptosis. To validate this
premise, we examined the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown
of PKCy vis-à-vis two other PKC isoforms (PKCa and PKCq,
representing conventional and novel PKC isoforms, respectively) on
rescuing FTY720-mediated apoptotic death in Huh7 cells. Huh7
cells were transfected with plasmids encoding shRNA against
individual PKC isoforms, followed by clonal selection. This
selection led to three stable clones with substantially reduced
PKCy expression, and one stable clone each for PKCa and PKCq
(Fig. 3B–D). This shRNA knockdown was highly specific because no
cross silencing of other PKC isoforms examined (a, q, and f) was
noted. As shown, only the knockdown of PKCy rendered Huh7 cells
resistant to FTY720-mediated apoptotic death (Fig. 3B), whereas
that against PKCa or PKCq exhibited no appreciable effect (Fig. 3C
and D).
Effect of FTY720 on PKCD activation. We showed that
treatment of FTY720 led to PKCy activation in Huh7 cells via
two distinct mechanisms, i.e., phosphorylation and proteolytic
cleavage. Of the four potential phosphorylation sites examined,
FTY720 caused a rapid increase in the phosphorylation at Try311,
Thr507, and Ser664, without affecting that of Tyr155 (Fig. 4A, left).
Moreover, this FTY720-facilitated phosphorylation at Thr507 and
Ser664 could be blocked by 1 Amol/L rottlerin (right), suggesting
that PKCy mediated autophosphorylation on these two sites.

Evidence suggests that phosphorylation at Tyr311 and that at
Tyr155 connote different physiologic roles in regulating the
function of PKCy (see Discussion). Moreover, proteolytic activation
of PKCy, which generated an active kinase domain, was also noted
after 12 h of exposure to FTY720 (Fig. 4B, left). In addition to the
cytoplasm, PKCy and its processed form were also detected, to a
lesser extent, in the nucleus (right), suggesting the potential
involvement of a nucleus-dependent pathway in the antitumor
effects of FTY720.
As there exists a mechanistic link between caspase-3 activation
and the proteolytic cleavage of PKCy (28), we examined the effect
of FTY720 on modulating the activity of caspase-3 in Huh7 cells by
using flow cytometric analysis. As shown, exposure to FTY720 led
to a dose-dependent stimulation of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 4C). For
example, FTY720 caused 3.5-fold and 4.8-fold increases in caspase
activity at 5 and 10 Amol/L, respectively. Equally important,
cotreatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK abrogated
the effect of FTY720 on facilitating the proteolytic cleavage of
PKCy (Fig. 4D), confirming the involvement of caspase-3 in PKCy
proteolysis. Overall, this suggests that proteolytic cleavage of PKCy
is a secondary event that occurs after activation of caspase family
members.
FTY720 activates PKCD through a ROS-dependent mechanism. We next sought to determine the upstream activator of
caspases in hepatocellular cancer cell lines that promoted PKCy
activation and cleavage. A variety of reported caspase enzyme–
activating stimuli have been shown to trigger PKCy activation in
different cell systems, including ROS (29), ceramide (30), tumor
necrosis factor a (31), Fas ligand (31), and radiation (32). The

FTY720 Mediates Apoptosis through PKCd Activation

present study shows that the effect of FTY720 on PKCy activation
was attributable to its ability to stimulate ROS generation in HCC
cells.
Flow cytometric analysis using the ROS-sensitive probe DCFDA
indicates that FTY720 at 10 Amol/L stimulated an immediate
robust increase in ROS production in Huh7 cells, and that the level
of intracellular ROS levels remained high even at 6 h after the
treatment (Fig. 5A). The time course of this ROS production
paralleled that of PKCy phosphorylation. Moreover, FTY720
induced different levels of ROS production among the three HCC
cell lines, in the order of Hep3B > Huh7 >> PLC5. It is noteworthy
that this FTY720-stimulated ROS generation inversely correlated
with the expression of GST-k (Fig. 5C), a phase II detoxification
enzyme, which has been implicated in protection against apoptosis
and drug resistance in cancer cells (33). However, the major ROS
produced in response to FTY720 remained unclear because no
significant increase in H2O2 generation was detected in FTY720treated Huh7 cells (data not shown).

The effect of FTY720 on increasing intracellular ROS levels was
independent of PKCy activity. As shown in Fig. 6A, although the
NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI could significantly inhibit FTY720stimulated production of ROS, rottlerin exhibited no appreciable
effect on ROS levels. Moreover, DPI was able to suppress the effect
of FTY720 on stimulating the phosphorylation and proteolytic
cleavage of PKCy (Fig. 6B), indicating the causative role of ROS in
PKCy activation. As a consequence, blockade of ROS generation by
DPI protected Huh7 cells from FTY720-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptotic death, with potency similar to that of rottlerin
(Fig. 6C). In contrast, DPI lacked appreciable effect on rescuing
FTY720-facilitated Akt dephosphorylation, suggesting that Akt
deactivation was not mechanistically linked to ROS-PKCy signaling
and did not play a crucial role in FTY720-mediated cell death
(Fig. 6D). Overall, this suggests that FTY720 production of ROS and
secondary activation of PKCy contributes to the cytotoxicity
observed in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines treated with this
agent.

Discussion
In light of the therapeutic potential of FTY720, the mechanism
underlying its antitumor effect warrants investigations. In this
study, we obtained evidence that FTY720 suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells, at least in part, by stimulating ROS production,
leading to PKCy activation and subsequent caspase-3–dependent
apoptosis. From a mechanistic perspective, ROS production
represents an early hallmark event in the apoptotic effect of
many therapeutic agents, including N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-retinamide (34, 35), arsenic trioxide (36), parthenolide (37), and cisplatin
(38). Relative to these agents, FTY720 represents a structurally
distinct type of small-molecule agent with unique mechanistic
features, which could be exploited to foster novel therapeutic
strategies for HCC treatment.
It is well-documented that drug-induced ROS stress triggers a
cascade of redox-dependent signaling events at difference cellular
levels, culminating in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (39).
This study obtains evidence in HCC cells that PKCy represents a
major downstream effector of FTY720-generated ROS to facilitate
caspase-3–dependent apoptosis, and that blockade of ROS
production by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI would protect
the cells from the effect of FTY720 on PKCy activation and
consequent apoptosis. From a mechanistic perspective, this
signaling pathway provides a molecular basis to account for the
differential susceptibility of different HCC cell lines to FTY720mediated apoptosis. As shown, the expression levels of PKCy and
GST-k represent two key determinants for the cellular capability to
cope with FTY720-incurred oxidative stress, which underlie the
resistant phenotype of PLC5 cells to the apoptotic effects of
FTY720. Consequently, these two biomarkers might be used as
predictors to select patients to receive FTY720 therapy. Moreover,
GST-k overexpression has been reported in a number of human
malignancies, and there exists a strong correlation between high
tumor GST-k levels and failure of patients to respond to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

chemotherapy and low patient survival rates (40). For a mechanistic perspective, therapeutic interference of GST-k expression/
activity by antisense or small-molecule agents provides a viable
strategy to overcome this resistance (41, 42).
PKCy has been shown to play an intriguing role in regulating
apoptosis, either proapoptotic or antiapoptotic, in different cell
systems (43, 44). This dichotomous behavior might be, in part,
controlled by phosphorylation at different tyrosine residues of
PKCy by different kinases. For example, stress signals such as
etoposide and H2O2 promoted the phosphorylation of tyrosine
residues at 64 and 187 (45), and especially 311 (29), respectively,
which presumably committed PKCy to activating caspases through
phosphorylation. On the other hand, phosphorylation on Tyr155
was reported to promote the antiapoptotic effect of PKCy in
Sindbis virus–infected glioma cells (46). Accordingly, the selective
phosphorylation of PKCy at Try311, but not Tyr155, in FTY720treated Huh7 cells underscores the proapoptotic nature of this
signaling pathway.
An earlier report indicates that FTY720 induced apoptosis in
HCC cells through phosphoinositide 3-kinase–mediated Akt
dephosphorylation (8). This premise, however, was disputed by
the finding that overexpression of constitutively active Akt could
not rescue Huh7 cells from FTY720-mediated cell death.
However, it is noteworthy that the mode of antitumor action
of FTY720 might vary in different types of tumor cells. For
example, in hematologic malignant cells such as those of chronic
myelogenous leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
FTY720 induced caspase-independent apoptosis by activating
PP2A signaling (47, 48). This PP2A activation, however, was not
noted in HCC or prostate cancer cells.4 This cell line specificity

FTY720 Mediates Apoptosis through PKCd Activation

Figure 6. Mechanistic link between ROS generation
and PKCy activation. A, effect of the ROS inhibitor DPI
and the PKCy inhibitor rottlerin on FTY720-mediated
ROS production. Huh7 cells were exposed to DMSO
vehicle, rottlerin (10 Amol/L), or DPI (10 Amol/L) for
30 min, followed by cotreatment with DMSO vehicle or
10 Amol/L FTY720 for 1 h, stained with DCFDA, and
subjected to flow cytometric analysis for ROS. B, DPI
inhibits the effect of FTY720 (10 Amol/L) on PKCy
phosphorylation (left) and proteolytic cleavage (right ).
For the assessment of PKCy cleavage, Huh7 cells
were exposed to DPI (10 Amol/L) for 30 min, followed
by cotreatment with FTY720 (10 Amol/L) in 10%
FBS–containing medium for 24 h. C, DPI (10 Amol/L)
and rottlerin (10 Amol/L) protect Huh7 cells from the
effect of FTY720 (10 Amol/L) on stimulating caspase-3
activation (left ) and nucleosomal fragmentation
(right ). Cells were treated with individual agents as
aforementioned. Columns, means; bars, FSD (n = 3).
D, DPI lacks effect on inhibiting FTY720-mediated Akt
phosphorylation. Cells were treated with individual
agents as aforementioned.

underlines the pleiotropic nature of FTY720 in killing cancer
cells. In light of the heterogeneity in molecular and cellular
abnormalities associated with oncogenesis and tumor progression, the ability of FTY720 to target different clinically relevant
signaling mechanisms in different cancer types might have therapeutic relevance in cancer therapy. Consequently, this rationale
constitutes the impetus of defining the causative mechanisms
for the antitumor effects of FTY720 in different types of cancer
cells.
In conclusion, this study shows the involvement of ROS-PKCy
signaling in FTY720-mediated apoptosis in HCC cells, of which the
therapeutic relevance is multifold. First, as PKCy is mostly
activated by genotoxic signals such as ionizing radiation (32) and
etoposide (49), FTY720 represents a novel PKCy activator without
known genotoxic effects. Second, dissociation of the antitumor
effect of FTY720 from its S1P activity provides a molecular basis to

www.aacrjournals.org

use it as a scaffold to develop potent antitumor agents devoid of
the immunosuppressive activity. Third, FTY720 and its derivatives
will be inherently suitable to treat cancers exhibiting increased
oxidative stress with high levels of cellular ROS and a low
antioxidant capability. Human HCC is prevalent in somatic GST-p
gene silencing due to CpG island DNA hypermethylation (50),
which provides a mechanistic rationale to include this type of ROSgenerating agents in HCC therapy.
