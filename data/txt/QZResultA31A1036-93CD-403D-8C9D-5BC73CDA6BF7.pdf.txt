Abstract
There are few reports describing the role of p53-dependent
gene repression in apoptotic cell death. To identify such
apoptosis-associated p53 target genes, we used the prooxidant plant-derived drug thymoquinone and compared
p53+/+ and p53 / colon cancer cells HCT116. The p53
wild-type (wt) status correlated with more pronounced DNA
damage and higher apoptosis after thymoquinone treatment.
A significant up-regulation of the survival gene CHEK1 was
observed in p53 / cells in response to thymoquinone due to
the lack of transcriptional repression of p53. In p53 / cells,
transfection with p53-wt vector and CHEK1 small interfering
RNA treatment decreased CHEK1 mRNA and protein levels
and restored apoptosis to the levels of the p53+/+ cells. p53 /
cells transplanted to nude mice treated with thymoquinone
up-regulated CHEK1 expression and did not undergo apoptosis unlike p53+/+ cells. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed
that the apoptosis resistance in p53 / cells after thymoquinone treatment might be conveyed by shuttling of CHEK1 into
the nucleus. We confirmed the in vivo existence of this CHEK1/
p53 link in human colorectal cancer, showing that tumors
lacking p53 had higher levels of CHEK1, which was accompanied by poorer apoptosis. CHEK1 overexpression was correlated with advanced tumor stages (P = 0.03), proximal tumor
localization (P = 0.02), and worse prognosis (1.9-fold risk,
univariate Cox regression; Kaplan-Meier, P = 0.04). We suggest
that the inhibition of the stress response sensor CHEK1 might
contribute to the antineoplastic activity of specific DNAdamaging drugs. [Cancer Res 2008;68(14):5609–18]

Introduction
p53 was shown to play a critical role in the induction of growth
arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage by chemotherapeutic agents (1, 2). These multiple functions of p53 are important
for tumor suppression, and loss of p53 enhances the risk of

developing malignancies (3). p53 triggers cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis through transactivation of specific target genes, such as
p21WAF1, GADD45, Bax, or PUMA (3, 4). Transcriptional activation is
mediated by p53 binding to consensus sequences in regulatory
regions (5, 6). Recent attempts to identify p53 target genes on a large
scale using microarray technology revealed that many p53responsive genes are repressed rather than activated, and that gene
repression by p53 is closely linked to its ability to induce apoptosis
(7). Transcriptional repression mechanisms are very complex
and are poorly understood (8–10). p53 was shown to down-regulate
the DNA damage sensor CHEK1 at the transcriptional level via direct
DNA binding (7, 11). This serine/threonine kinase is the major cell
cycle checkpoint mediator that is activated upon DNA damage,
especially double strand breaks, through the upstream kinases
ATH/ATR (12, 13). CHEK1 responds to DNA damage by initiating cell
cycle arrest, thus providing time for the cell to repair the damage and
to evade apoptosis before resuming cell cycle. Studies have reported
that CHEK1 inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging
agents (14–17). CHEK1 expression constitutes a defense mechanism
to circumvent the toxicity of DNA-damaging agents.
Recently, we have shown that the functionality of p53 has a
significant effect on cancer cell sensitivity to thymoquinone, an
extract of the black seed Nigella sativa oil (18, 19). Thymoquinone
as a short-chain ubiquinone derivative potentially acts as a prooxidant (20). We found that thymoquinone induces cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in HCT116 human colon cancer cells in a p53dependent manner (18). As it is unclear whether p53-mediated
transactivation or transrepression contributes to p53-dependent
apoptosis, we used thymoquinone as a tool for oxidative stress
induction to identify downstream targets of p53 and to understand
their role in p53-induced apoptosis. By comparing the gene
expression profiles of HCT116 p53+/+ with p53 / cells after
thymoquinone treatment, in vitro and in xenografts, we show that
the sensitivity of these cells to thymoquinone-induced apoptosis is
due to transcriptional repression of CHEK1 by p53 in p53+/+
HCT116 cells. This is the first report of a CHEK1/p53 link and its
prognostic significance in human colorectal cancer tissues.

Preparation of mitochondria. Mitochondria from rat liver were
prepared as described previously (21). Details are in the supplement.
Measurement of reactive oxygen species levels. Generation of
superoxide (O2 ) by mitochondria was measured as oxidation of Amplex
red (Molecular Probes) to resorufin. In the presence of horseradish
peroxidase, Amplex red reacts with H2O2 to resorufin; mitochondrial
protein (0.2 mg) was incubated at 25jC in 1 mL buffer supplemented with
5 Amol/L Amplex red plus horseradish peroxidase (2 units/mL) to detect
H2O2 and, for quantitative conversion of O2 into H2O2, with Cu, Zndismutase (2 units/mL). Changes in fluorescence were monitored by a
Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorescence spectrometer (excitation at 560 nm,
emission at 590 nm). Fluorescence intensity was calibrated with H2O2.
Aconitase activity. Oxidative stress was measured by inactivation of
the mitochondrial enzyme aconitase. Enzymatic activity was measured by
the formation of NADPH at 340 nm (22). Mitochondrial protein (0.4 mg)
was preincubated for 15 min at 37jC in buffer supplemented with
thymoquinone. Thereafter, 5 mmol/L citrate, 0.8 mmol/L NADP+, 0.6
mmol/L MnCl2, and 2 units of isocitrate dehydrogenase were added. To
allow the indicator metabolites to have access to matrix aconitase, 0.05%
lauroyl maltoside (v/v) was added. NADPH formation was photometrically
recorded for 10 min.
Diffusion apoptosis slide halo assay. Trevigen’s diffusion apoptosis
slide halo (DASH) kit allows for an easy discrimination of normal and
damaged cells. The method was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol with cells pretreated with thymoquinone 40 Amol/L for 24 h (more
details in the supplement).
Cell growth and treatment. Human colon cancer cells HCT116
(p53 / and +/+) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 Ag/mL), and 10% FCS at 37jC
in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The HCT116 p53 / cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Carlos Galmarini (Institut National de la Sante et de la
Recherche Medicale, Lyon, France). Cells seeded on six-well plates at a
density of 106 per well were treated with thymoquinone 24 h after plating,
and treatment was replenished every 48 h.
Patients. Sporadic colorectal carcinoma specimens were obtained from
the Department of Surgery, Medical Faculty Magdeburg, between 1996 and
2005. All aspects of this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethics
Committee, and all patients provided informed consent. The tumors were
proven to be microsatellite stable as described previously (23). All
carcinomas were treated solely by partial colectomy with R0 resection.
Tumor and nontumor samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at
80jC for molecular studies, and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded for
immunohistochemical analysis. All malignancies were examined by a
pathologist, and tumor staging and grading were determined according to
the recent guidelines of Union internationale contre le cancer (UICC)
tumor-node-metastasis and WHO classification system (24).
Two groups of tumors were investigated: Group A included 20
carcinomas of known p53 mutation status identified in a former study
using PCR single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Group B
comprised 122 carcinomas. Survival data were available for 99 patients. p53
mutation status of tumors in this group was not investigated. Clinicopathologic data of both study groups are given in the supplement.
cDNA array analysis. To identify apoptosis-associated genes that are
dysregulated by thymoquinone, we used GEArray Q series Human
Apoptosis Gene Array (Superarray Bioscience Corp.) as described recently
(25). The complete gene list can be found online.11
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Real-time reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) was performed as described previously (25). Primer
sequences and PCR conditions are given in the supplement.
Protein extraction and immunoblotting. Proteins were prepared as
described previously (19). Immunodetection was done using the following
primary antibodies: anti-p53 DO1 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Sc.),

anti-CHEK-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti–caspase-3 (Cell Signaling),
and anti–h-actin (Sigma Aldrich). Details are given in the supplement.
Caspase-3 assay. Caspase-3 activation was measured using the CCP32/
caspase-3 fluorometric protease assay kit (Chemicon) as described recently
(ref. 26; details in the supplement).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was carried out in thymoquinone-treated HCT116
p53+/+ cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Upstate
Biotechnologies). CHEK1 promoter primers were sense 5¶-AAGCTCCAACATAAACTGCTCGCTTTC-3¶ and antisense 5¶-GTGCTTTGTAAACCTCAGAGTGCGGTACT-3¶ as described previously (7). Details are given in the
supplement.
Transient transfection. HCT116 p53 / cells were transiently transfected with a p53 wild-type (wt) expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The expression
vector encoding p53-wt was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Haupt (Jerusalem,
Israel). Cells were treated with TQ60 24 h following transfection.
Small interfering RNA transfection. SiRNA transfection was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Santa Cruz) as described
previously ( for details, see Supplementary Data; ref. 19).
Tissue microarray. Representative regions of colorectal carcinomas of
the study group B were selected on H&E-stained slices for inclusion in
a tissue array. More details are given in the supplement.
Immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxyribonucleotide
transferase–mediated nick-end labeling assay. For immunohistochemistry, we used the following antibodies: p53 (mouse monoclonal antibody,
OP43, dilution 1:30; Oncogene Research Products), CHEK1 (G-4; mouse
monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and hMLH1 (mouse
monoclonal antibody, G168-15, dilution 1:20, Zymed Laboratories). More
details are given in the supplement. Positive immunoreaction of p53 or
CHEK1 and positive terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase–mediated
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) reaction was assessed in representative tumor
tissue by two different pathologists blinded to clinical data. A tumor
was considered positive for p53 accumulation when >5% of the tumor cell
nuclei showed definite staining. Cytoplasmic and partly nuclear immunoreaction was recognized for CHEK1. Positive tumor cells were counted. The
apoptotic index was determined by counting the number of TUNEL-labeled
cells per 100 epithelial cancer cells in 20 fields in the most affected tumor
areas under 400 magnification.
TUNEL assay. TUNEL staining was performed as described previously
(23). More details are given in the supplement.
Fluorescence immunostaining analysis. The CHEK1 subcellular
localization was carried out on HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 /
treated with thymoquinone 60 Amol/L for 48 h and grown on two-well
chamber slides (Nunc). CHEK1 was stained with anti-CHEK1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and the nucleus was stained with 4¶-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Xenograft model. The experiment was performed as described
previously (27). Ethical approval was obtained before beginning the
experiments (Regional Government of Lower Franconia, Germany). More
details are given in the supplement.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using the m2
test in cross tables and one-way ANOVA ( for comparison of means) to
assess the relationship between immunohistochemical CHEK1 protein
expression and clinicopathologic factors. All tests were performed twosided. To correlate the CHEK1 and p53 or hMLH1 immunohistochemical
protein expression levels, we performed Spearman correlation coefficient
analysis and the U test for independent variables, respectively. Total survival
curves were drawn according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared
using the log-rank test. Deaths from unrelated causes were censored.
Univariate and multivariate analysis based on Cox’s regression analysis was
adjusted to test the prognostic relevance of clinicopathologic factors and
CHEK1 expression. We used log-linear model and the related m2 test for
analysis in multivariate contingency tables as well as the configuration
frequency analysis for the identification of types and antitypes. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Calculations were carried out by SPSS
version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc.).

CHEK1/p53 Link in Colorectal Cancer

Results
Thymoquinone induces ROS generation and DNA damage.
An early cellular response to double strand breaks is the
phosphorylation at Ser139 of a subclass of eukaryotic histones,
H2A.X (13). TQ at 60 Amol/L caused early and dramatic increase in
the amount of H2A.X protein in p53+/+ cells, whereas the amount
was slightly increased in the p53 / cells (Fig. 1A). In accordance
with these data, DASH assay revealed fewer damaged cells in p53 /
cells (Fig. 1B). The changes in H2A.X protein expression and
apoptosis were compared with the enhanced oxidative stress in
thymoquinone-treated cells. The effect of thymoquinone on

mitochondrial superoxide (O2 ) generation was studied with
isolated, functionally intact rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 1C and
D). Figure 1C shows fluorescence traces indicating the O2
mediated oxidation of Amplex red to resorufin. These traces clearly
revealed that low concentrations (5–20 Amol/L) of thymoquinone
remarkably enhance the generation of ROS. Mitochondrial ROS
generation initiated by 20 Amol/L thymoquinone is completely
abolished in the presence of catalase, an enzyme decomposing the
oxidant H2O2. For comparison, Fig. 1D shows the increase of ROS
generation adjusted by antimycin A (trace 2 Amol/L), an inhibitor
of the electron transport respiratory chain, which was used to

Figure 1. Thymoquinone treatment induced DNA damage in colorectal cancer cells dependent on their p53 status and ROS production by rat liver mitochondria.
A, 60 Amol/L thymoquinone (TQ ) induces different DNA damage signals in HCT116 p53+/+ and p53 / cells reflected by the expression level of H2A.X. B, the DASH
assay shows the characteristic apoptotic pattern in HCT116 p53+/+ cells, where the alkaline lysis unwinds the DNA in the damaged cells releasing fragments that
diffuse away from the center of nucleoid, creating a halo surrounding a small compact region. In HCT116 p53 / cells, there is a significantly higher number of
undamaged cells. C, stimulation of mitochondrial ROS production by thymoquinone. Rat liver mitochondria (Mito ) suspended in incubation buffer were exposed to
thymoquinone (2, 5, 10, and 20 Amol/L) or 2 Amol/L of antimycin A (Anti A) or 10 AL of catalase (Cat) plus 20 Amol/L thymoquinone. The traces show the fluorescence
increase. D, inactivation of aconitase by thymoquinone-induced mitochondrial ROS production. Rat liver mitochondria were treated first with various concentrations
of thymoquinone; thereafter, aconitase activity was measured. Typical traces of aconitase-mediated reduction of NADP+ in mitochondrial samples are shown.

stimulate ROS. The harmful consequences of thymoquinoneinduced ROS generation on the mitochondrial physiology were
examined by measuring the aconitase activity, an enzyme of the
citric acid cycle that responds to superoxide (22). Figure 1D (inset)
shows that thymoquinone dose dependently inactivates aconitase,
suggesting that the enhanced ROS production severely damages the
mitochondrial energy metabolism.
Dysregulation of several apoptotic genes in colorectal
cancer cells after thymoquinone treatment. We have previously
reported that thymoquinone induces apoptosis selectively in
HCT116 p53+/+ colorectal cancer cells and this apoptosis was
mediated through p53 (18).
To identify thymoquinone-modulated, apoptosis-associated
genes, we analyzed the expression of 96 key apoptotic genes using
GEArray Q series Human Apoptosis cDNA microarray. We
compared HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 / cell lines treated
with 60 Amol/L thymoquinone for 48 h. Genes that are up-regulated
only in the HCT116 p53 / cells are likely to be p53 repressed,
whereas genes that are up-regulated only in the HCT116 p53+/+

cells are p53 induced. Genes that are dysregulated similarly in both
cell lines are thymoquinone-modulated p53-independent genes
(Supplementary Table S1). The expression of 17.7% apoptosisassociated genes was modulated by thymoquinone. Analyzing the
microarray, it seemed that the most marked difference between
drug-treated HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 / cells was the
8.9-fold up-regulation of CHEK1 in HCT116 p53 / cells, whereas
it was 2.5-fold decreased in the HCT116 p53+/+ cells (Supplementary Table S1).
CHEK1 regulation after thymoquinone treatment of HCT116
cells is p53 dependent. To verify the adequacy and status of the
CHEK1 mRNA expression and the CHEK1 protein expression, we
used real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Both
analyses showed that thymoquinone induces a significant downregulation of CHEK1 mRNA and protein especially at 48 h in
HCT116 p53+/+ cells, whereas there was significant induction of
CHEK1 in HCT116 p53 / cells at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 2A and C).
Furthermore, thymoquinone up-regulates p-CHEK1 in HCT116
p53 / cells but not in HCT116 p53+/+ cells (Fig. 2B). This

Figure 2. Analysis of p53 and CHEK1 mRNA and protein expression in HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 / cells during thymoquinone treatment. A, after
thymoquinone treatment (20, 40, and 60 Amol/L), p53 is up-regulated in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas CHEK1 protein expression is simultaneously
down-regulated in HCT116 p53+/+ cells. In HCT116 p53 / cells, p53 is not detectable, and CHEK1 is up-regulated after thymoquinone treatment. Fold expression
changes are given below the blots. B, after 48 h, thymoquinone 60 Amol/L up-regulates p-CHEK1 in HCT116 p53 / cells but not in the HCT116 p53+/+ cells.
C, up-regulation of CHEK1 in HCT116 p53 / cells occurred at the transcriptional level shown for thymoquinone 60 Amol/L: The ratio of CHEK1/h2-microglobulin after
thymoquinone treatment versus control ratio was set at 1.0 (*, thymoquinone treatment at all three time points was statistically significant against the control for
P < 0.01). Columns, mean from three experiments; bars, SD. ChIP assay using p53 antibody confirmed that there is transcriptional repression of CHEK1 expression
after thymoquinone treatment in p53+/+ cells. Two controls were included: the input control (Input ) and a negative control ChIP (Neg. con ) without using the p53
antibody. CHEK1 protein amount (WB , Western blotting) decreases with stronger binding of p53 at the CHEK1 promoter (D).

Figure 3. Association between p53/CHEK1 level and caspase-3 activity in HCT116 p53+/+ and p53 / cells. Thymoquinone 60 Amol/L treatment (TQ60 , 48 h)
induced CHEK1 mRNA expression in p53 / cells (#, P < 0.01). Transfection of p53 / cells with a p53-wt vector (CCC ) significantly reduced the amounts of CHEK1
transcripts (*, P < 0.01; A) and protein (B) and enhanced their caspase-3 activity (*, P < 0.01; C ). Thymoquinone treatment of p53-wt–transfected p53 / cells
did not further decrease CHEK1 mRNA (A ) or protein expression (B), nor did it increase caspase-3 activity (C ). Knockdown of CHEK1 by siRNA reduced CHEK1
protein by 65% (inset, D ) and significantly enhanced the caspase-3 activity after 48 h of thymoquinone treatment (*, P < 0.01; D). The mock control did not influence
CHEK1 protein levels (data not shown) or caspase-3 activity levels. Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SD.

indicates that p53 status directly influences CHEK1 expression in
response to thymoquinone.
p53 interacts directly with CHEK1 promoter. CHEK1 is
directly repressed by p53 after treatment of HCT116 cells with the
anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (7). To determine whether CHEK1
down-regulation is due to direct transcriptional repression by p53
promoter binding, we used p53 antibody to immunoprecipitate
chromatin from HCT116 p53+/+ cells treated with the drug. The
ChIP assay showed that the genomic fragment containing p53
binding site from CHEK1 promoter was enriched during the
course of treatment, reaching 3-fold after 24 h and 15-fold after
48 h (Fig. 2D). The level of p53 binding inversely correlated with
the accumulation of CHEK1 RNA transcripts (Fig. 2C) and CHEK1
protein (Fig. 2D). This suggests that the down-regulation of
CHEK1 protein may be partly caused by p53 binding at the
CHEK1 promoter.
Both recovery of p53 function and knockdown of CHEK1 in
p53 / cells sensitize them to apoptosis. To gain further insight
into whether p53-dependent down-regulation of CHEK1 contributes to apoptosis after thymoquinone treatment (TQ60, 48 h), we
transfected HCT116 p53 / cells with p53-wt containing plasmid
vector to restore p53 levels. Indeed, p53 / cells transfected with

www.aacrjournals.org

p53-wt showed nearly the same low amount of CHEK1 mRNA
(Fig. 3A) and protein expression (Fig. 3B) as observed in p53+/+
cells. After drug treatment, the CHEK1 mRNA and protein
expression was 20% higher in p53 / cells compared with
transfected cells (Fig. 3A and B). The transient overexpression of
p53 substantially enhanced caspase-3 activity (2.5-fold; Fig. 3C).
Transfection of p53 / cells with an empty vector caused no
significant caspase-3 activation (data not shown).
To study the role of CHEK1 in thymoquinone-induced apoptosis,
we transfected p53 / cells with CHEK1 siRNA (Fig. 3D).
Immunoblotting showed that CHEK1 protein was reduced by
60% in transfected cells (Fig. 3D, inset). Caspase-3 activity reached
f2-fold higher levels than in p53+/+ cells (Fig. 3C and D).
Our data suggest that the repression of CHEK1 expression by
thymoquinone may prevent cells from progressing through a
prosurvival pathway.
p53-dependent CHEK1 repression is evident in human
colorectal cancer tissues and is accompanied by enhanced
apoptosis. In an attempt to use an in vivo model to validate our
in vitro findings, we investigated CHEK1 levels in a panel of human
colon cancer tissues that are well characterized for p53 mutation
status and for immunohistochemical p53 protein expression (study

group A). We used two types of tumors that differ in their p53
status. The first group included tumors bearing p53 frameshift
mutations (deletion or insertion, legend of Fig. 4) resembling the
HCT116 p53 / cells. The second group consisted of tumors with
p53-wt resembling the HCT116 p53+/+ cells. The first group
showed loss of p53 mRNA expression (Fig. 4A) and p53 protein
expression in immunohistochemistry (data not shown) and
Western blotting (Fig. 4C). p53-wt tumors were negative in Western
blotting and weakly expressed p53 protein in only a few tumor
nuclei using immunohistochemical staining. Although available,
p53 protein was undetectable because of its short half life, but p53
mRNA expression was detectable (Fig. 4A). Confirming the in vitro
findings, p53-wt tumors showed lower CHEK1 mRNA expression
[average ratio CHEK1/h2-microglobulin, 0.31 (0.1–2.5); Fig. 4B]
compared with the p53-deleted tumors [average ratio CHEK1/
h2-microglobulin, 6.39 (3.1–8.9)]. p53-deleted tumors showed
higher amounts of CHEK1 protein [average ratio, 1.4 (0.8–2.7)]
compared with p53-wt tumors [average ratio, 0.4 (0.2–0.6); Fig. 4C].
Using TUNEL, we showed that p53-wt tumors had higher number
of apoptotic cells than tumors bearing a truncated p53 protein
(Fig. 4D).
p53-dependent CHEK1 repression in mouse xenografts
enhances drug sensitivity. We have previously reported that
thymoquinone delays the growth of HCT116 p53+/+ mouse

xenografts (27). By contrast, in this study, the growth of p53 /
xenografts was nearly unaffected by thymoquinone treatment after
14 days of injection (p53+/+ cells: control 20.2 mm F 1.2,
thymoquinone 14.2 mm F 1.4; p53 / cells: control 13.1 F 1.1,
thymoquinone 12.6 mm F 0.5). To determine if the in vivo
sensitivity of p53+/+ xenografts to thymoquinone was due to p53dependent CHEK1 repression, we characterized the xenograft
tissues for CHEK1 protein expression levels. Indeed, p53+/+
xenografts showed a significantly lower CHEK1 expression
compared with the p53 / ones (Fig. 5A and C). To assess if
the differential growth delay was related to apoptosis, we
performed TUNEL staining of tissues and caspase-3 cleavage by
Western blotting. Again, p53 / cells having the highest amounts
of CHEK1 protein showed the lowest signs of apoptosis (Fig. 5C
and D; Supplementary Fig. S1). These data provide compelling
evidence for the involvement of the stress response sensor CHEK1
in thymoquinone-induced apoptosis.
Furthermore, in xenograft tissues of p53 / cells, thymoquinone resulted in a stronger nuclear shift of CHEK1 protein
expression, whereas in untreated (p53 / or p53+/+) cells, a weak
nuclear expression of CHEK1 was detected (Fig. 5A). Coimmunofluorescence analysis of HCT116 cells grown on coverslips showed
an increase in CHEK1 protein expression in the cytoplasm as well
as in the nucleus of p53 / cells after thymoquinone treatment,

Figure 4. Comparison of the expression of p53 and CHEK1 proteins in p53 / (del*) and p53-wt human colorectal carcinomas (study group A). Whereas the p53
mRNA expression did not differ between both tumor groups (A ), a significantly higher CHEK1 mRNA expression was detected in the p53 / (del) tumors
compared with the p53-wt tumors (B ). There was no visible p53 band in the p53 / and p53-wt samples in the immunoblot, but a higher CHEK1 protein expression
was found in the p53 / tumors compared with low CHEK1 expression in the p53-wt tumors (C ). *, detailed information about the p53 mutations: case 1 (exon 5,
codon 146, 1-bp insertion), case 2 (exon 7/splice acceptor, 12-bp deletion), case 3 (exon 4, codon 93, C-deletion/ stop-codon in exon 4), case 4 (exon 6, codon 190,
5-bp deletion/stop-codon in exon 7). TUNEL staining of p53 / (del) tumors revealed a remarkably lower number of TUNEL-positive nuclei (arrows ) compared
with p53-wt tumors; two examples are given (magnifications: 100, 10; insets, 400, 4; D).

Figure 5. Analysis of p53 and CHEK1 expression in mouse xenograft tissues and correlation with apoptosis. A, light microscopic images (200 magnification) of
immunohistochemistry for CHEK1 and CHEK1 subcellular localization in p53+/+ and p53 / tumors after thymoquinone treatment. Specimens obtained from
p53 / cells (con, control) strongly express CHEK1 protein with a further increase and simultaneous occurrence of nuclear shuttling after drug treatment (enlargements
in A). Specimens with p53-wt status (con, control) show high CHEK1 protein expression; drug treatment resulted in a remarkable reduction of CHEK1
immunostaining without nuclear signals. B, we confirmed the nuclear shuttling of CHEK1 after thymoquinone treatment in HCT116 p53 / cells using fluorescence
immunostaining. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After blocking with 1% bovine serum
albumin for 10 min, they were incubated with mouse anti-CHEK1 antibody overnight at 4jC, followed by incubation with Cy3 anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma).
The slides were counterstained and mounted with DAPI (Vector Labs) and were examined using Axioplan2 (Zeiss) fluorescent microscope. C, box plot analysis
showing the percentage of CHEK1-expressing tumor cells (left ) and of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (right ) in mouse xenografts after thymoquinone
treatment. The number of investigated mouse tissues is given below the graph. D, Western blotting for CHEK1 and caspase-3 cleavage in mouse xenografts
confirmed that p53 / cells significantly up-regulated the protein amount of CHEK1 and did not undergo apoptosis after thymoquinone treatment. Thymoquinone did
not induce CHEK1 protein expression but induced caspase-3 cleavage in p53+/+ colon cancer cells. The number of animals is given above the gel image.

whereas in the p53+/+ cells CHEK1 nearly disappeared and was not
visible in the nucleus of tumor cells. Our data suggest that, in the
absence of p53, thymoquinone causes the shuttling of CHEK1 into
the nucleus (Fig. 5B).
CHEK1 overexpression has a prognostic effect on sporadic
colorectal cancer patients. Immunohistochemical protein expression of CHEK1, p53, and hMLH1 was investigated in a group of
sporadic colorectal carcinomas (study group B) and corresponding
nontumor colon tissue grouped in a tissue microarray (Fig. 6A).
According to the ROC curve, an optimal balance between
sensitivity (68.3%) and specificity (61.4%) was reached at 60%
positivity for CHEK1 expression (Fig. 6B). Sixty of 122 carcinomas
(50.8%) showed cytoplasmic CHEK1 expression in >60% of the
tumor cells and were considered as CHEK1-overexpressing tumors

(Fig. 6A). CHEK1 overexpression correlated significantly with
tumor localization (P = 0.02); distal tumors more frequently
overexpressed CHEK1. This was confirmed by the multivariate
configuration table. It revealed two ‘‘types’’ that reflected the
overrepresented combinations of the following variables. Type 1:
CHEK1 low, alive, proximal tumor localization; type 2: CHEK1
overexpression, died of disease, distal tumor localization (P < 0.004,
Table 1). CHEK1 overexpression was correlated with advanced
tumor stages (Fig. 6C; P = 0.03). There was no association between
CHEK1 expression and other clinicopathologic factors such as sex,
tumor size, lymph node metastases, tumor grading, and age. There
was no correlation between CHEK1 and p53 protein expression
(Spearman correlation coefficient: r s = 0.045, P = 0.674) as well as
between CHEK1 and hMLH1 immunostaining (U test, P = 0.828).

(pN), UICC stage, and CHEK1 expression
had prognostic significance. D, the

tumors displayed the worst clinical
outcome. mo , months.

Patients who had CHEK1-overexpressing tumors had a worse
prognosis than those having tumors with low CHEK1 expression.
After 5 years, patients affected by tumors with CHEK1 overexpression and those without had overall survivals of 49% and
30.8%, respectively. Twenty-seven of 54 patients (50%) with CHEK1overexpressing tumors but only 14 of 57 patients (24.6%) with
CHEK1-low expressing tumors died of disease (P = 0.006; Fig. 6D).
There was a high predictive value for CHEK1 overexpression and
clinical outcome. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed 1.95fold increased risk of dying of disease in the CHEK1-overexpressing
tumor group (Fig. 6D). All four factors that were significant in the
univariate analysis were included in the multivariate test for
independency. Only UICC staging, pT, and CHEK1 expression
retained their strong independent prognostic value (P < 0.01). In
normal colon mucosa, nuclear expression of CHEK1 protein was
detected with attenuation of the crypt base (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

Discussion
In a genome-wide scale, p53 was shown to induce apoptosis
through transcriptional activation of its putative apoptotic targets
(e.g., PUMA, NOXA, PIG3, Fas/CD95). However, there is indirect

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (14). July 15, 2008

evidence that p53 also induces apoptosis through transcriptional
repression of antiapoptotic signals (e.g., PLK, PTTG1, CHEK1;
refs. 7, 28). The mechanisms of p53-mediated repression and its
involvement in apoptosis are poorly understood.
By comparing the gene expression profiles of HCT116 p53+/+
and their p53-null counterparts after thymoquinone treatment, we
attempted to identify p53-dependent target genes that could
explain the differential sensitivity of these cells to drug-induced
apoptosis. CHEK1 was chosen for further investigation, as it was
9-fold up-regulated by thymoquinone in HCT116 p53 / cells.
Here, we show that p53 protein represses the expression of CHEK1
in HCT116 p53+/+ cells. Recently, it was reported that p53
transactivates CHEK1 expression through binding to a putative
p53-responsive element in the CHEK1 promoter between nucleotides 1429 to 1169 (7). In response to thymoquinone, p53
binding occurred at the CHEK1 promoter in HCT116 cells as
revealed by ChIP assay. The tested genomic fragment containing
the p53 binding site from the CHEK1 promoter (7) was enriched
after ChIP, which is in accordance with the down-regulation in
CHEK1 protein expression. Using a panel of human colon cancer
tissues well-characterized for p53 mutation status, we confirmed
the in vitro findings in human tumors in vivo and showed that p53
mutations, resulting in a truncated nonfunctional p53 protein, had

significantly higher amounts of CHEK1 mRNA and protein. This
was accompanied by poor caspase-3 activation when compared
with p53-wt–expressing colon carcinomas. Further evidence for the
involvement of CHEK1 down-regulation in drug-induced apoptosis
was shown by our mouse xenograft study (27). We found that
tumor growth was significantly inhibited by thymoquinone in
HCT116 p53+/+ xenografts, which may be attributed to the
induction of apoptosis as indicated by TUNEL positivity and
caspase-3 cleavage. Thymoquinone-induced tumor growth delay
was diminished in the p53 / xenografts. We observed p53dependent subcellular localization of CHEK1 with lack of nuclear
staining in p53+/+ cells after thymoquinone treatment. In contrast,
we did not find any differences in subcellular localization of CHEK1
in both untreated HCT116 p53+/+ and p53 / control cells, as
well as in p53-null and p53-wt human tumors. Considering both
the xenograft findings and the results of the in vitro immunofluorescence staining, showing CHEK1 in the nucleus after thymoquinone treatment, we suggest that nuclear shuttling of CHEK1
occurs only in response to thymoquinone.
Two different pathways have been implicated in viability
following DNA damage, the CHEK1/CHEK2 pathway and the
p53/p21WAF1 pathway (29, 30). According to earlier studies (18),
thymoquinone induced G1-S arrest in HCT116 p53+/+ colorectal
cancer cells. p53 / cells, which are defective in G1 arrest, rely
more strongly on the S or G2 checkpoint to repair their damaged
DNA when treated with genotoxic drugs (14). Indeed, after
thymoquinone treatment, a significant proportion of HCT116
p53 / cells arrested in the S phase (data not shown).
CHEK1 seems to play a role in the cross-talk between the
mechanisms that drive apoptosis and those that control the cell
cycle. It seems to prevent cells bearing damaged DNA from
progressing through the cell cycle, which would lead to an
unsuccessful and lethal attempt to undergo cell division (15, 31).
In agreement with a CHEK1 antiapoptotic role, conditional CHEK1
knockout mice showed severe cell death in proliferating somatic
cells (32). An antiapoptotic role for CHEK1 in response to
replication fork stresses was recently reported (33). To determine
whether CHEK1 down-regulation contributes to enhanced apoptosis in p53-wt cells, we evaluated the apoptotic response of p53 /
cells after transfection with p53-wt plasmid. The level of caspase-3
activity in transfected p53 / cells was restored to that of p53-wt
cells. The knockdown of CHEK1 in p53 / cells by siRNA led to

enhanced caspase-3 activity in response to thymoquinone. We are
aware that no target of p53 will suffice to recapitulate the p53dependent apoptosis phenotype under all physiologic circumstances. In certain tissues and under conditions of stress
development, some p53 targets may be required for apoptosis.
In accordance with other studies, we showed that thymoquinone is a potent inducer of mitochondrial O2 generation. This
finding can be explained by two properties of thymoquinone: (a)
a high solubility in the lipid core of the inner mitochondrial
membrane and (b) an easy reduction of thymoquinone to its
semireduced form. It seems that thymoquinone enhances the
superoxide generation after its incorporation in the respiratory
chain by increasing the capacity of complex III for the oneelectron transfer reaction to molecular oxygen. The stimulation of
O2 generation by thymoquinone can be because it is chemically
related to ubiquinone, ultimately leading to the development of
peroxide. This suggests that the semireduced thymoquinone
increases the capacity of one-electron transitions to molecular
oxygen. A recent report indicated that the half-reduced form of
ubiquinone, semiubiquinone, is a critical site of the one-electron
transfer to molecular oxygen, thereby forming the superoxide
radical (34). The observation that thymoquinone acts as a potent
inducer of mitochondrial ROS suggests that it initiates oxidative
stress inside cells. Mitochondria are likely to be also the target of
the harmful effects of ROS, which eventually leads to apoptosis.
Our study of osteosarcoma cells indicated that thymoquinone
induces apoptosis through the cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase9 (19). Furthermore, the ability of thymoquinone to induce DNA
damage in colorectal cancer cells points to the possibility that
such damage may be the key factor for the activation of CHEK1
damage checkpoint.
To date, only two recent studies have reported on CHEK1
expression in cancer (35, 36). Investigating a group of Korean
colorectal cancer patients, they showed that CHEK1 gene had
more functionally inactivating frameshift mutations in patients
with microsatellite instability. These mutations lead to a
defective DNA damage response. In a study of human breast
cancer, CHEK1 overexpression was significantly correlated
with higher tumor grade (36). These authors confirmed an
E2F-dependent transactivation of the CHEK1 promoter in vitro
and in vivo. We show for the first time a correlation between
CHEK1 overexpression and tumor malignancy and a worse

prognosis, respectively, in colorectal tumors. This seems to be of
great clinical interest because it has been suggested that
inhibition of checkpoint signaling, especially by CHEK1 inhibitors, may correlate with the effectiveness of cancer treatment
(37). The higher frequency of CHEK1-overexpressing tumors in
distal tumor localization is in accordance with the observation
that distal tumors also show a higher number of p53 mutations
(38). Even so, it was not surprising that CHEK1 protein
expression did not correlate with p53 protein expression in
tumors, because p53-wt and p53-null tumors cannot be
differentiated by immunohistochemistry. In addition, we have
no data available whether different p53 mutants are able to
repress CHEK1 differently. CHEK1 overexpression does not seem
to be correlated with the chromosomal instability group as
shown by a lack of correlation between CHEK1 and hMLH1
immunostaining.
In summary, p53-dependent CHEK1 inhibition as shown by the
action of thymoquinone seems to be a general mechanism
responsible for apoptosis induction in colorectal cancer. Our data

confirm the existence of a CHEK1/p53 link and its prognostic
significance in human colorectal cancer tissues. Because colon
cancers harbor p53 mutations in >50% of cases and CHEK1
activation lowers the efficacy of DNA-damaging drugs, we believe
that thymoquinone, in combination with CHEK1 inhibitors, may be
therapeutically promising for colorectal cancer.
