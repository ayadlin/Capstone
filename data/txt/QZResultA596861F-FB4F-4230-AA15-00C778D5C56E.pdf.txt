ABSTRACT
Unlike genetics, epigenetics involves the modification of genome without changes
in DNA sequences, including DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin
remodeling and noncoding RNA regulation. MicroRNA (miRNA), a member of noncoding
RNAs superfamily, participates in RNA interference through a unique mechanism.
Currently, microRNAs have been found to be regulated by some natural compounds.
Through altering the expression of miRNAs and influencing the downstream signaling
pathways or target genes, several natural compounds exhibit its bioactivity in the
prevention, diagnosis, therapy, prognosis and drug resistance of human diseases,
such as cancer. In this review, several natural compounds and their studies about
miRNA-related action mechanism were summarized. These studies provide a new
insight into action mechanism by which natural compound exerts its bioactivity and
a novel treatment strategy, demonstrating natural compound a promising remedy
for clinical treatments.

INTRODUCTION

widely used into clinical treatment due to its innovative
structure, high biological activity and low side effects.
However, its complicated mechanism is difficult to
be elucidated, which limit its application. Increasing
evidence has revealed that some natural compounds
exhibit anticancer properties through epigenetic regulation
[4]. During its antitumor action, natural compounds have
been shown to alter expression profiles of certain miRNAs
by unknown mechanisms. In this review, these miRNAassociated natural compounds are listed as examples to
describe this phenomenon and summarized for their
possible action mechanisms.

MicroRNA (miRNA), a kind of non-coding RNAs,
which is generally delineated as endogenous around
22 nt RNAs that can play important regulatory roles in
animals and plants by targeting mRNAs for cleavage
or translational suppression [1]. In animals, posttranscriptionally, miRNA binds to the 3’ untranslated
region (3’-UTR) of target mRNA via imperfect matching,
which results in inhibition of translation. In plants,
miRNA leads to mRNA degradation through perfect
or nearly perfect matching with the open reading frame
(ORF) of target mRNA (Figure1). It has been reported
that conserved miRNA targets cover more than one third
of human genes [2]. Numerous studies have revealed
miRNAs’ function in cancer development and its aberrant
expression profiles compared to normal cells in human
malignancy. Moreover, miRNAs even involves in action
mechanism of antitumor drugs, at least in part. All these
features make miRNA a promising biomarker [3] and drug
target for diagnose, therapy and prognosis.

and egg yolk, etc., which is a common ingredient in the
infant formula for its vital importance in the development
of baby intelligence and vision. In current investigation,
DHA works as a preventative drug and an adjuvant drug
to breast cancer treatment with unclear mechanisms. One
of reported anticancer mechanisms of DHA is suppression
of tumor angiogenesis. Recently, microRNAs in secreted
exosomes, which can be transferred to endothelial cells
where they induce pro-angiogenic effects encourages a
research group to investigate the relationship between
DHA and exosomal miRNAs. Results revealed that DHA
both increases exosome secretion and miRNAs (let7a, miR-21, miR-23b, miR-27b, and miR-320b) levels
in exosomes and these miRNAs are also increased in
the endothelial cells by DHA treatment of MCF7 cells.
This study indicates that, in breast cancer, DHA is likely
to inhibit angiogenesis through stimulating exosome
secretion and altering exosomal miRNAs [5].

have reported that resveratrol suppresses glioma cell
growth by down-regulating oncogenic microRNAs
(miR-21, miR-30a-5p, miR-19) and up-regulating their
targets’ expression, which are closely relevant to glioma
formation and development [7]. Resveratrol has also been
found to decrease the portion of breast cancer stem-like
cells by increasing Argonaute2 (Ago2, a component of
RNA-inducing silencing complex, RISC) expression
through enhancing promoter activity and prolonging
half lives of mRNA and protein. In this process, many
tumor-suppressive miRNAs are also increased. Similarly,
dimethylether resveratrol analogue pterostilbene has also
been shown to exert antitumor activity in a miRNAdependent manner. This finding indicates that this activity
is likely common in stilbene family containing resveratrol
[8].

Curcumin

Resveratrol

Curcumin is a powerful polyphenolic and
antioxidant compound found in turmeric. Preclinical
studies suggested that curcumin shows an antitumor
effect on diverse carcinomas, including retinoblastoma,
pancreatic cancer, glioma, lung cancer, colon cancer,
hepatoma, breast cancer, cervical carcinoma, leukemia,

Resveratrol is a polyphenolic phytoalexin abstracted
from peanut, mulberr and red wine, etc., which has various
bioactivities, such as anticancer, immunoregulation and
protection against cardiovascular disease [6]. Studies

miR-21, an oncomir that involves in tumor protein p53
(TP53) signaling and other cancer pathways [18].
BBMD3, a berbamine (BBM) derivate, is found
to inhibit cell viability and induce apoptosis in cancer
stem-like cells (CSCs) of human glioblastoma. The
up-regulation of miR-4284 can partially accounts for
antitumor mechanism of BBMD3, although the relevant
signaling cascade is not completely clear [19]. CXCL5,
which has been reported to function for various cancer
development, has been confirmed to be a direct target of
miR-4284 [20], suggesting that CXCL5 might be also
involved in BBMD3’s effect. .

gastric carcinoma, prostate cancer, melanoma, oral
epithelial cancer, bladder cancer and ovarian cancer,
etc. [9]. Recent studies have summarized the epigenetic
alteration induced by curcumin [10]. Many investigations
have been focused on miRNA to demonstrate curcumin’s
action mechanism. In pancreatic cancer cells, curcumin
inhibits cell growth and invasion through up-regulation
of miR-7 and down-regulation of its oncogenic target,
lysine methyltransferase SET-8 [11]. MiR-146a, a negative
regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling that
promotes tumor growth and survival, is up-regulated in the
curcumin-mediated sensitization of human glioblastoma
cells to temozolomide [12]. A tumor-suppressive
miRNA, miRNA-203, is frequently downregulated in
bladder cancer. Curcumin has been found to promote
its expression and block its target genes Akt2 and Src,
ultimately inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation
[13]. In cisplatin-resistant human lung carcinoma cells
A549/DDP, curcumin inhibits the overexpression of miR186*, leading to elevated apoptosis and declining survival
rate with unclear action mechanism [14]. In chronic
myelogenous leukemia cells, the reduction of miR-21 in
exosomes may be related to the antileukemic activity of
curcumin [15].

Aplysin
Aplysin is a marine brominate compound that can
not only suppress malignancy, but also eliminate drugresisitance of cancer cells. Since miR-181b-abundant
glioma cells is more sensitive to temozolomide (TMZ)
[21], aplysin enhances TMZ action through increasing
the expression of miR-181 in TMZ-resistant glioma cells,
which results in MEK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase 1) downregulation [22].

(6)-Gingerol (6G)

Methyl jasmonate

(6)-Gingerol is a natural polyphenolic alkanone
with antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties. Previous
studies have reported that miRNA is also associated with
the antitumor activity of 6G. By means of suppressing
mitochondrial respiratory complex (MRC I), 6G induced
the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) followed
by DNA damage and up-regulation of miR-27b, and in
turn, miR-27b inhibits the PPARy-NF-κB pathway and
leads to the apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells [16].

Drug combination is a novel strategy for clinical
medication for its great synergy, such as methyl jasmonate
and gambogic acid (GA). Studies have revealed that the
sensitivity of GA-treated human bladder cancer cells to
apoptosis triggered by methyl jasmonate is relevant to
the down-regulation of enhancer of zeste homologue 2
(EZH2) level by the elevation in the expression of miR101, which directly targets EZH2. Their combination
increases the antitumor efficacy compared to GA alone
[23].

Diaporine A

Ellagitannin (BJA3121) and BJA32515

Diaporine A is a bioactive substance isolated from
endophytic fungus 3lp-10. A study has demonstrated
that diaporine A can inhibit non-small cell lung cancer
growth by up-regulating miR-99a, which is followed by
the suppression of mTOR signaling pathway to achieve its
antitumor effects [17].

Ellagitannin (1,3-Di-O-galloyl-4,6-(s)-HHDP-bD-glucopyranose, BJA3121) and BJA32515 (1,3,4-triO-galloyl-6-O-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranose)
are
polyphenolic compounds extracted from Balanophora
Japonica Makino and exhibit antiproliferative effect.
Giving the fact that miRNAs play critical roles in
cancer cell proliferation, studies have demonstrated that
ellagitannin BJA3121 and BJA32515 are likely to inhibit
HepG-2 cancer xenograft growth by modifying miRNA
expression profiles [24, 25].

Genistein

Andrographolide

Genistein is an isoflavonoid isolated from dietary
soybean, it has been found to inhibit several oncomirs’
expression and promote tumor-suppressing miRNAs’
expression to function as a promising antitumor drug. In
pancreatic cancer cells, genistein inhibits cell proliferation
and increases apoptosis by down-regulating miR-223 [26]
and up-regulating miR-34a expression [27], whose targets
Fbw7 and Notch-1 are upregulated and downregulated,
respectively. In ovarian cancer cells, genistein inhibits
cell migration and growth via reducing overexpressed
miR-27a accompanied by increasing its target, Sprouty2
[28]. In prostate cancer cells, genistein inhibits invasion
and migration by its down-regulation of miR-151 [29] and
up-regulation of miR-574-3p [30].

Andrographolide is abstracted from Andrographis
paniculata, which is famous for its anti-inflammatory
activity. Accumulated studies have been reported its
inhibition of hepatoma tumor growth in vivo and in vitro.
Recent studies found that andrographolide can upregulate
the expression of some miRNAs, including miR-222-3p,
miR-23a-3p, miR-106b-5p and miR-30b-5p. Target genes
of these miRNAs are also downregulated. All of them
are likely to be related with the anti-hepatoma activity of
andrographolide [34].

Prodigiosene
Prodigiosene
(methyl-3-pentyl-6methoxyprodigiosene) is a kind of secondary metabolite
abstracted from the cell wall of Serratia marcescens.
A latest Iran study found that prodigiosene can induce
apoptosis in colorectal cancer stem-like cells by increasing
the expression of miR-16-1 and decreasing its target gene,
survivin. As it is believed that overexpression of survivin
in cancer stem-like cells lead to the failure of clinical drug
administration, prodigiosebne could be a good choice
for fighting against this obstacle in counties with high
morbidity and mortality of colorectal cancer, such as Iran
[35].

1’S-1’-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA)
1’S-1’-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) is a natural
product and reported to serve as a chemosensitizer. ACA
can potentiate the antitumor activity of cisplatin on human
cervical cancer cell line, Ca Ski by altering miRNAs that
are predicted to target genes associated with cell cycle
progression and apoptosis [31]. The changes in miRNA
level between the administrations of cisplatin alone and
cisplatin plus ACA are remarkable.

that oleanolic acid exerting its antitumor activity by
upregulating miR-122, a tumor suppressor in lung cancer
in vivo and in vitro. In addition, overexpression of CCNG1
(cyclin G1) and MEF2D (myocyte enhancer factor 2D),
two targets of miR-122 also abolished the antitumor effect
in lung cancer, which indicates that oleanolic acid may

OF
NATURAL
COMPOUND-RELATED MIRNAS

Considering that some miRNAs are relevant to
tumorigenesis and development, 3,6-DHF was employed
to study in vivo and in vitro to investigate whether some
miRNAs play roles in the antitumor effect of flavonoids.
It is found that 3,6-DHF activates apoptosis in breast
cancer cells via reversing the upregulation of miR-21 and
the down-regulation of miR-34a induced by tumorigenic
1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU), indicating that miR-34a
and miR-21 are partly relevant to flavonoids’ inhibition of
tumorigenesis and promotion of apoptosis [33].

Taken together, there are some remarkable
regulations in the identification of natural compoundassociated miRNAs. (1) Bioactivities of some miRNAs
are similar with the pharmacological effects of a given
natural compounds on cancer cells [5,7,8, 16,19,21,22,2427,29,30,31], this similarity encourages researchers to
wonder whether natural compound exhibits its effect
by affecting these miRNAs. For example, miR-181 is
related to TMZ-resistance of glioma, and interestingly,
15964

Oncotarget

aplysin can also enhance the sensitivity of glioma cells
to TMZ. Thus, researchers investigated their association
and found aplysin exerts its function through increasing
the expression of miR-181. (2) If the target of a natural
compound is identical to the potential target of a certain
miRNA, it do deserves further investigation about their
relation [11,12,15,17,18,23,32]. For example, methyl
jasmonate and miR-101 share a common target, EZH2.
Studies have been carried out to investigate their relation
and found that methyl jasmonate down-regulated EZH2
level by the elevation in the expression of miR-101. (3)
Some miRNAs play roles in the formation and progression
of cancer and aberrantly expressed in cancer cells
compared with normal counterpart. If results from qRTPCR and microarray analysis indicate that a certain natural
compound can reverse the aberrant expression profiles of
some miRNAs, it is likely that natural compound exerts
its effect through altering these miRNA expression
profiles [13, 14, 21, 28, 33]. For example, the expression
of a tumor-suppressive miRNA, miR-203 is rather low in
bladder cancer. Nevertheless, curcumin increases miR203’s expression and then inhibits cancer cell growth to
achieve its antitumor activity.

treatment of natural compounds, by diverse delicate
mechanisms. The possible mechanisms are listed as below:
Impact on the transcription of primary miRNA
Primary miRNA transcript is the first step of miRNA
biogenesis (Figure 1). Transcriptional factors related to
this process may mediate the influence on the level of
miRNA by natural compounds. Transcriptional factors
modulating miRNAs could be collected from TransmiR
database [37].
In addition, miRNA expression has also been
reported to be affected by epigenetic regulation such
as histone modification and DNA methylation [38].
Hypermethylation in the CpG islands of miRNA’s
promoter is responsible for its epigenetic silence in several
human cancers [39].
A usual epigenetic agent that could inhibit DNA
methyltransferase in cancer cells, 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine
(5-Aza-dC), exhibit maximal DNA de-methylation activity
without killing cells at a suitable concentration [40],
and thus, 5-Aza-dC can be applied to test whether the
methylation of miRNA’s promoter is responsible for its
dysregulation. In non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple
myeloma, miR-129-2 serves as a tumor suppressor and its
promoter is frequently methylated [41]. In gastric cancer,
miR-196b acts as an oncomir and it is overexpressed
because of hypomethylation of its CpG islands [42]. In
prostate cancer, miR-31 plays a role as an antioncogene
and its promoter is hypermethylated [43]. Similarly,
miR-203 is a tumor suppressor and it is inactive due to
the hypermethylation of its promoter in bladder cancer
cells. However, miR-203 expression can be augmented by
curcumin with partial demethylation of its promoter [13].
(2) Impact on miRNA processing and maturation
The post-transcription process of miRNA biogenesis
is described as follow: Primary miRNA is cleaved into
precursor miRNA, and in turn, these precursors are
transferred from the nucleus into cytoplasm (Note:
primary and precursor miRNA are both hairpin RNAs
with double strands). Subsequently, precursor miRNAs are
processed by Dicer into shorter fragment without hairpin
segment. This shorter fragment contains mature miRNA
and its complementary strand. The useless complementary
strand will be discarded at last (Figure 1). In these steps,
certain RNA-binding proteins [44] participate can be the
targets of natural compound.
Aberrant processing of mature miRNA could be
evaluated by the ratio of mature miRNA and precursor
miRNA (M/P ratios), which can be calculated based on
the abundance of mature miRNA and precursor miRNA
measured by deep sequencing analysis. In human glioma,
the M/P ratios of many miRNAs are higher than normal
brain, and are increased along with the severity of glioma.
Moreover, systematical abnormal expression of genes
relevant to miRNA processing in nucleus, transport from
nucleus to cytoplasm, and processing in cytoplasm takes
place in glioma tissues [45].

CONFIRMATION OF MIRNAS AS A
NATURAL COMPOUND’S TARGETS
Confirming a miRNA candidate as an authentic
target of natural compounds includes the following steps:
confirmation of miRNA candidates, discovery of the
mechanism by which a natural compound influences these
miRNA candidates, determination of the roles that miRNA
plays in natural compound’s antitumor effect, exploration
of the action mechanism of miRNA-mediated antitumor
effect of natural compound, and at last, in vivo evidence
from animal experiments.

Confirmation of miRNA candidates
Usually, microarray analysis can be carried out to
determine miRNAs with altered expression level after the
treatment of a natural compound. The miRNA candidates
that are overexpressed or underexpressed by more than
two folds are selected for further study to confine the
measurement error. However, the chosen miRNAs are still
needed to be verified by qRT-PCR.

Discovery of the mechanism by which a natural
compound influences these miRNA candidates
Generally, gene regulation is so precise that cells
can employ them to adapt to the changing complicated
environments. As a non-coding gene, the regulation of
miRNA is also believed to accurately response to the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

15965

Oncotarget

It has been reported that some anticancer chemicals
exhibit affinity binding to the pre-miRNA of miR-155 to
prevent its cleavage from Dicer, and therefore, interfere
with mature miR-155 synthesis [46].
(3) Indirect mechanisms
Indirect mechanisms are unrelated to miRNA
biogenesis, such as miRNA-sponging effect of circular
RNA [47] and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) [44],
which may also explain the modulation of natural
compounds on miRNA expression.
It should be highlighted that regulation of different
miRNAs modulated by one natural compound can be
precise and specific. For example, in human pancreatic
cancer cells treated with circumin, miR-181d is
significantly changed, but miR-181c (chr19:1387469913874808), which is close to miR-181d (chr19:1387487513875011) in the genome, is not changed [48].

www.geneontology. org) is an international gene function
system, the distribution of gene function in GO analysis
could be studied by KEGG to elucidate the appearance
of gene function due to the difference of sample. By
employing pathway significance enrichment analysis,
target genes-related signaling pathways with remarkable
enrichment contrast to the whole genome could be
indentified easily.
In this regard, the network of a natural compoundmiRNAs-target genes could be printed [34].
Besides, Whether a natural compound could effect
on the downstream signaling pathway of miRNA or not
can be tested by building up luciferase reporting vector
containing promoter of downstream elements’ genes
and detecting the fluorescence intensity. And with the
help of siRNA expression cassettes (RNA interference)
and overexpression vector ( such as pcDNA and Dox
,) , miRNA target genes’ expression can be altered to
investigate if the natural compound could also take into
effect.
It must be noted that the regulation of a gene is a
combinational and complex result, the degradation from
miRNA may not be the main point, influenced activity of
the gene promoter and the cleavage of the gene translated
protein by some enzyme, such as caspase3, could also
make sense. This phenomenon is reflected on the distinct
effect on miRNAs under different concentration of a
natural compound [54]. Moreover, it is believed that there
are negative feedback regulation between miRNA and
its targets. For example, downregulation of miR-34a/b/c
increase the expression of its target, SNAIL. In turn,
SNAIL suppresses the miR-34a/b/c expression by binding
to the E-boxes in the miR-34a/b/c promoters [55].

Determination of the roles that miRNA plays in
natural compound’s antitumor effect
Subsequently, it is necessary to evaluate if the
interference of miRNA level by transfection of precursor
mimics or antagomir antisense could rescue the effects
of the natural compounds, such as cell cycle arrest,
cytotoxicity, anti-migration and anti-invasion activities.
If this interfering can reverse the effect of natural
compounds, it can be concluded that the natural compound
might exert its effect via certain miRNAs.

Exploration of the action mechanism of miRNAmediated antitumor effect of natural compounds

Acquiring in
experiments

To further investigate which target or downstream
signaling pathway of miRNA ultimately accounts for the
dependence of natural compound’s antitumor activity on
miRNA, some studies have been conducted to figure out
more precise molecular mechanisms.
Differential gene expression profiles before and
after the treatment of the natural compound assessed by
proteomic technology [49] or CRISPR-Cas9 genome
editing technology [50] could be taken together with the
target genes of miRNAs predicted by several software
[51], such as DIANA-microT 3.0 [52], RNA22, miRDB,
miRanda, Tarbase [53] and TargetScan to find the
overlapped genes, that is, the bona fide target genes that
mediate the miRNA-relayed effect of natural compounds.
In addition, target genes collected from the overlapped
data from at least thee target prediction software of
miRNAs could also be selected as candidates for later
analysis. Both of the results above need to be filtered and
confirmed by qRT-PCR.
Then, signaling pathways associated with the target
genes could be enriched by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG). Gene Ontology (GO, http://

Moreover, animal experiments are also
necessary to obtain in vivo evidence. Xenagroft or
orthotopic transplantation tumor model are established
by intraperitoneal injection, intravenous injection
or subcutaneous injection, followed by periodical
administration referencing clinical experience of natural
compounds at proper doses or maximum tolerated dose
(MTD). Then, some fundamental measurement should
be performed in virtue of in vivo imaging system (IVIS)
[56], such as tumor size, weight, latency, and incidence.
If the effect of the given compounds on the invasion
and metastasis of tumors are aimed to be tested, the
mice should be sacrificed and tumor metastasis must be
counted.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
Currently, most researchers focused antitumor
15966

mechanism of natural compounds on protein, but more
and more evidence has revealed that miRNAs can also be
related to tumor suppressor activity of natural compounds.
The general action mechanism by which natural compound
exerts its miRNA-dependent antitumor function is as
follows: a natural compound exhibits its effects through
up-regulating or down-regulating miRNAs to suppress
or activate their target gene expressions or their relevant
signaling pathways. Moreover, the components of RISC
can also be promoted by natural compounds. Some issues
are still to be addressed.
Beside microRNA, other kinds of non-coding
RNA, such as lncRNA (long non-coding RNA), small
interfering RNA (siRNA), piRNA (Piwi-interacting RNA)
and circRNA (Circular RNA) may also be involved in the
action mechanism of anticancer drugs. These RNAs are
also of unexpected and remarkable effect on malignance.
CircRNA is stable and conserved in cytoplasm, it acts as
more than miRNA sponge. Recent study summarized that
cirRNA regulates tumor-related pathways together with
miRNA, linear RNA transcription and protein production
[47]. LncRNA is larger than other non-coding RNAs
with more than 200 nt, it plays important roles in various

processes, such as chromatin looping, protein scaffolding,
gene transcription, post transcriptional processing, miRNA
sponge [57], endocrine resistance [58] and so on. It has
been reported that genistein inhibits cell proliferation in
prostate cancer cells through reduction of an oncogenic
lncRNA, HOTAIR [59]. SiRNA is usually employed
in gene knock-down, it acts similar posttranscriptional
mechanism to miRNA. After cleaved by Dicer, long
double strand RNA are teared into many siRNAs, among
them, the siRNAs complementing the mRNA transcribed
by the target gene will interact with RISC and then
unfolded to sigle strands. The antisense will bind the target
mRNA and degrade it. PiRNA defends the genome against
insertional mutation caused by transposon in germ cell
lines and benefits the somatic gene regulation by sequencespecific histone modification and DNAmethylation. In
human breast carcinoma, piRNA is reported to make sense
through remodeling the tumor epigenome [60].
In addition, the significance of these studies is
profound, which not only serves as the new evidence
for designing of novel miRNA-targeting therapeutic
strategy for cancer, but also provides a new insight
into our understanding on the molecular mechanism

underlying human malignancy. Particularly, detecting
the levels of tissue/organ-specific miRNAs will benefit
diagnosis, therapy monitoring and prognosis of cancer.
Intriguingly, most of the natural compounds above belong
to polyphenolic compounds (Figure 2), suggesting that
some structures in this group of compounds may have
advantages of binding or targeting miRNA molecules
over other compounds without similar structures. So
is it possible to develop more potent and effective
miRNA-targeting agents based on this type of chemical
compounds? Furthermore, downstream proteins of
compound-related miRNAs can also be selected as drug
targets for further development.
