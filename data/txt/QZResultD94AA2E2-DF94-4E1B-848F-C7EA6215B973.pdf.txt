Abstract
Retinoid X receptor (RXR) is a combinatorial partner for one
third of the 48 human nuclear receptor superfamily members
and acts as a master coordinator of nuclear receptor signaling
pathways involved in the control of cell growth and
differentiation. Thus, ligand-dependent simultaneous activation of multiple pathways is an attractive strategy for
molecular-targeted therapy of neoplastic disease. However,
clinical trials in RXR-targeted molecular therapy with the RXR
ligand (rexinoid) have yielded disappointing outcomes. In this
review, we discuss a possible mechanism underlying the loss of
sensitivity to rexinoid therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(12):4945–7]

Background
RXR is a combinatorial partner for one third of the 48 human
nuclear receptor superfamily members (1), thus enabling to
activate multiple signaling pathways in both ligand dependent
and independent manners. RXR forms three different types of
dimers; RXR homodimer, permissive heterodimers, and nonpermissive heterodimers. RXR homodimers and RXR permissive
heterodimers (e.g., PPAR, LXR, and PXR) are activated upon RXR
ligand binding because this class of dimer formation triggers a
conformational change of the RXR that allows subsequent binding
to the RXR. By contrast, nonpermissive heterodimers (e.g., RAR,
VDR, TR) cannot be activated by the RXR ligand and RXR serves as
a silent binding partner because binding of nonpermissive
heterodimers to the RXR does not permit ligand binding to the
RXR. These dimeric receptors bind to specific DNA response
element of target genes (1), and their DNA binding specificity is
determined by the number of spacer nucleotides present between
the two direct repeats of the canonical binding sequence AGGTCA
(2). For example, the RAR/RXR heterodimer binds to the retinoic
acid response element (RARE) and the RXR homodimer binds to
the retinoid X response element (RXRE), in which the consensus
half sites are separated by five (DR5) or a single nucleotide (DR1),
respectively. This tight regulatory control of the ligand-dependent
transactivation of the nuclear receptor superfamily makes possible
a multitude of therapeutic applications including anticancer
treatments (3). On the basis of promising anticancer effects of
RAR ligands in in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, the
development of RAR selective ligands and their clinical application
have been extensively investigated. However, clinical application of
RAR ligand has only shown limited efficacy possibly because of
multiple adverse effects caused by the requirement of large dosage

to reach therapeutic efficacy, (2) frequent loss of, or (3) reduced
RAR expression in various cancer types. Conversely, RXR ligands
(rexinoid) have shown promising chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activities with mild toxicity in several cancer types
tested, and RXR expression is rarely lost in human tumors.
In an attempt to achieve the activation of multiple pathways,
various rexinoids have been developed and some have shown
promising antitumor activity in preclinical and clinical studies (4).
A specific synthetic rexinoid, bexarotene, was found to induce a
50% overall inhibitory response in patients with refractory or
persistent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma when administered either
orally or topically with minimal toxicity (5). These clinical results
have led to FDA approval of Bexarotene. Another RXR-selective
retinoid, LGD1069, was shown to suppress both estrogen receptorpositive (ER+) tumor development in the methylnitrosourea
(MNU)-induced rat mammary tumor model and ER negative
(ER ) tumor development in mouse mammary tumor virus-erbB2
transgenic mice (6). Though the mechanisms underlying rexinoidinduced antitumor effects are not clearly understood yet, growing
evidence suggests possible roles of RXR in carcinogenesis. Ablation
of RXRa results in hyperplasia in the prostate epithelium and
skin (7, 8). In addition, we and others have shown that RXRa
overexpression sensitizes tumors to the antigrowth effects of
rexinoid both in vitro and in vivo for the induction of cellular
differentiation and the control of aberrant cell growth (9). It is
evident that RXR plays vital roles in multiple signaling pathways
including carcinogenesis via nuclear receptor family members, and
the loss of RXR function will likely negatively impact physiological
roles of the nuclear receptors.
Multiple pathway activation by a single agent is a highly
attractive approach for molecular targeted therapy, however, the
molecular mechanisms underlying the gene modulations by ligand
activated RXR are highly complex due to a lack of comprehensive
understandings of RXR-induced multi-pathway activation. In fact,
despite promising results from preclinical studies as well as
successful clinical application of rexinoid in the treatment of
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, clinical trials investigating the use of
rexinoid for the treatment of lung and breast carcinoma have
yielded disappointing results. In a clinical trial conducted with 145
metastatic breast cancer patients, rexinoid (bexarotene) showed
limited activity, with a 20% partial response in women with
hormone-refractory or chemotherapy-refractory disease (10). In a
more recent phase III clinical trial, rexinoid used in combination
with first line chemotherapies, such as cisplatin or carboplatin,
failed to meet primary endpoints in advanced non small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) (ref. 11). However, rexinoid therapy significantly improved the overall survival in certain patient subgroups
(i.e., males, smokers, and patients with stage IV disease) compared
with the control group (11). The molecular mechanisms underlying this subgroup-dependent response and the molecular basis
of rexinoid resistance remains to be understood. In this review,

Figure 1. The figure illustrates the point that the RAR to RXR ratio may be a determinant of effectiveness of retinoids in p21 transcription and tumor suppression.
The favorable condition is when that ratio is small so as to permit the prevalence of RXR-homodimer, necessary for p21 activation, and minimize the formation of
RAR/RXR heterodimer.

we will discuss obstacles for rexinoid therapy and possible
solutions.

Key Finding
We previously reported two independent mechanisms by which
highly invasive breast cancer cells lose their sensitivity to rexinoid,
and further addressed an approach to resensitize the unresponsive
cells. We have reported that the subcellular localization of RXRa
changes whereas the total RXRa protein expression remains the
same in highly malignant human breast cancer cells. An altered
localization of RXRa to the splicing factor compartments (SFCs),
rather than in the nucleoplasm, caused the loss of functional
activity of RXRa as a transcription factor (12). The consequence of
the loss of RXRa function due to its altered localization is rather
severe because many nuclear receptor superfamily members require
RXR for their function as a dimerization partner of ligand
dependent responses. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analysis
of invasive breast cancer tissue revealed that the same RXRa altered
localization to the SFCs was also detected in tumor stroma
( fibroblast), though not in breast cancer epithelial cells. This altered
localization was not due to mutation of RXRa, but rather likely to
protein-protein interaction via C-terminus of RXRa. The incubation
of the cells with an RXR-terminus peptide corresponding to the
RXRa C-terminus allowed for RXR distribution to the nucleoplasm

from the SFC and the restoration of responsiveness to RXR ligand.
Our preliminary data also showed that this type of altered
localization of RXRa may occur frequently in breast carcinoma.3
Our data suggest that loss of RXRa function due to the sequestration, although total expression level remains the same, causes a
disruption of RXR-mediated signaling pathways. RXR has three
different subtypes and the loss of RXRh and g can be compensated
by RXRa, however, not the other way round. Therefore, the impact
of the loss of RXRa might be severe and the sequestration of
RXRa affect the entire RXRa signaling cascades.
Another line of studies addressed the molecular mechanism of
rexinoid-induced growth inhibition and further highlighted the
complex nature of RXR signaling. We showed that ligand-activated
RXR upregulates p21 expression at the transcription level via RXR
homodimer binding to the two consecutive RXRE in the p21
promoter region, leading to an induction of cell cycle arrest,
followed by apoptosis (9, 12). However this rexinoid-induced cell
cycle arrest was significantly inhibited by the presence of RAR.
Interestingly, we found that both RXREs sequences overlap with a
previously reported RAR/RXR heterodimer binding sequence
(RARE) (ref. 13), raising the question whether RAR/RXR heterodimer

binds to the RARE and interferes with the binding of RXR/RXR
homodimers to the RXREs, and in turn promotes the loss of RXR
ligand-mediated p21 transactivation. We showed that the presence
of RAR interferes with RXR ligand-mediated p21 induction owing to
RAR binding to the RARE situated between the RXREs. Furthermore, in an RNAi approach to knock down the expression of RARa
and RARg, the RXR ligand upregulated p21 expression concomitant
with the reduction in the S phase population of the cells. Together,
these data suggested that the level of RXR ligand-mediated growth
inhibitory effect could be manipulated by the overall amount of
retinoid receptors (RAR and RXR). It might be important to further
investigate whether the RAR interference on RXR ligand-mediated
cell growth inhibition is RAR isotype specific or not. Overall, our
studies further pointed out the complex nature of multiple
pathways activation by RXR by demonstrating two independent
mechanisms leading to rexinoid resistance: (1) different RXR
subcellular localization and (2) an altered balance of RXR and RAR.

Implications and Questions
A recent clinical trial with RXR ligand as a single therapeutic
regimen has shown a favorable clinical outcome with mild toxicity
for a selected subgroup of advanced lung cancer patients (11),
suggesting that the downstream target of RXR would provide a
mechanistic understanding of the anticancer effect of RXR ligands.
One of the affected downstream pathways by liganded RXR is the
p21 through RXR homodimer bindings to the two sequential
RXREs, which overlap with an RARE (Fig. 1). Because the RAR/RXR
heterodimers bind to the RARE with high affinity, RAR/RXR
heterodimer prevents RXR homodimer-mediated p21 promoter
activation. Histopathological studies have shown that downregulation of RARa during tumor progression coincides with loss
of response to RAR ligand (14), and the loss of RARh is commonly
observed at the early stage of tumorigenesis in multiple cancers (3).
Conversely, all RXR isotypes are overexpressed in 66% of breast
ductal carcinomas in in situ lesions (15), and in particular RXRa
upregulation is associated with malignant transformation (16).
These aberrant expressions of RAR and RXR during tumorigenesis
may change the cellular response to retinoid and rexinoid

treatment. The ratio between RXR and RAR is likely one of the
key parameters to determine therapeutic outcome of rexinoid
therapy, i.e., high RXR to RAR expression level is required for p21
induction (G1 arrest) and high RAR to RXR to prevent p21
expression and lead to apoptosis. Similar to our findings, there
have been a few examples that two distinct classes of transcription
factors can recognize a common regulatory sequence. Further, it
should be noted that the nuclear receptor signaling network can be
paradoxical and the divergent responses from multiple cell types
may be attributed to the loss of or reduced receptor expression,
altered localization, or intricate transcriptional regulation.
In addition to the paradox of RXR signaling pathway, an antiapoptotic role of p21 has been reported. Although p21 plays a key
role in cell growth inhibition by activating p53 upon DNA damage,
p21 can also block p53-mediated apoptosis when DNA is damaged
at a low degree. Possible anti-apoptotic roles of p21 have been
observed mostly in p53 wild-type cells, indicating that p53 activity
may be the key determinant factor on whether p21 functions as
pro-apoptotic, anti-apoptotic, or as a cell cycle regulator. Similar to
this, pathological analysis from non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
and ovarian cancer patients showed that the 5-year survival ratio of
p21 positive and p53 negative patients have the most favorable
prognosis over p21 negative and p53 positive patients or over both
positive (17). In addition, recent studies revealed a functional
disruption of p21 via phosphorylation by Akt in Her2/nue
overexpression cancers (18). These findings further suggest that
RXR ligand-mediated cell growth inhibition may require a selective
molecular signature beyond RAR/RXR ratio. Prescreening of cancer
patients by determining the RAR/RXR ratio (Fig. 1), as well as the
subcellular localization of RAR and RXR, may be crucial for
enhancing the efficacy of p21-targeted RXR ligand therapy via the
pleiotropic retinoid response element RXREs/RARE.
