BACKGROUND. The Akt/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
pathway represents a promising target for cancer therapy. The phosphorylation
status of Akt and of mTOR’s phosphorylation target eukaryotic initiation factor
4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) is often used to assess the activity of Akt and
mTOR signaling. The purpose of this study was to determine whether primary
tumors differ from their metastasis in their expression of pAkt and p4E-BP1.
METHODS. Primary breast tumors and their distant metastases surgically resected
from the same patients were evaluated with immunohistochemical analysis
(IHC) for pAkt (Ser473) and p4E-BP1 (Ser65). The agreement between the IHC
results for the primary tumor and metastases was evaluated with Cohen kappa
(j).

RESULTS. Most primary breast tumors and metastatic tumors expressed pAkt
(76% of each). Of the 23 matched evaluable pairs, however, 11 (47.8%) had discordant IHC results (j 20.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.49 to 20.13).
Similarly, although most of the primary and metastatic tumors were positive for
p4E-BP1 (75% and 74%), of the 23 matched evaluable pairs, 8 (47.8%) were discordant (j 0.10; 95% CI, 20.33–0.52).

CONCLUSIONS. In this series, most primary breast tumors and metastases
expressed pAkt and p4E-BP1 by IHC. Concordance between IHC findings in primary tumors and metastases was poor, however. Further work is needed to determine whether this reflects true biological heterogeneity or poor reproducibility of

T

he Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Akt/
mTOR signaling is aberrantly activated in several tumor types,
including breast cancer, through mutations or decreases in expression of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10), mutations in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), or
activation/amplification of growth factor signaling.1,2 mTOR exists
in at least 2 distinct functional complexes (TORC1 and TORC2).3,4
Activation of mTORC1 results in phosphorylation of its effectors eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and S6K1,
while mTORC2 is believed to regulate Akt Ser473 phosphorylation.
Akt Ser473 phosphorylation is thought to precede Akt Thr308 phosphorylation by PDK1, and is important in fully activating Akt.3 Both
high levels of pAkt and of p4E-BP1 have been associated with a

poor prognosis.5,6 Thus, the Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway is an especially promising target for breast
cancer therapy.
Inhibitors of PI3K and Akt are now in early clinical development. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
and its analogs have been tested actively in clinical
trials for the past few years and have shown preliminary promise of efficacy in several tumor types.7–9
Treatment with the rapalogue temsirolimus was associated recently with a survival advantage over interferon-alpha in a phase 3 clinical trial in advanced
renal cell carcinoma (CCI-779, Wyeth, Madison,
NJ).10
Most studies of mTOR inhibitors have shown
clinical benefit for a small subgroup of patients.
Notably, most of these studies were conducted in the
metastatic setting, without selection of patients for
activity of Akt/mTOR signaling. In preclinical work,
tumors that have activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
have been sensitive to rapamycin; however, the value
of pAkt as a predictive marker has not been validated
in clinical trials.11,12
There remains a pressing need to identify markers that can determine the activity of Akt/mTOR
signaling in tumors, and to determine whether
marker assessment in the primary tumor accurately
reflects the status of metastases arising from the
same tumor. In this study we sought to determine
whether primary tumors differ from their metastasis
in expression of pAkt and p4E-BP1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics
Patients who had breast cancer metastases surgically
resected with palliative or curative intent were identified by searching databases maintained in the
Departments of Surgical Oncology, Thoracic Surgery,
Orthopedic Surgery, and Neurosurgery at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. We then
identified patients who had both their primary tumor
and a distant metastasis surgically resected at the
center. The study was limited to 29 patients for
whom tissue blocks were available and viable tumor
was identified on pathologic analysis. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board.
The median patient age was 43 years (range, 26–
76). At primary breast cancer diagnosis, 7 patients
had stage I disease, 14 stage II, 6 stage III, and only 2
stage IV. Of the 28 patients who underwent axillary
staging, 18 had lymph node-positive disease. Of the
23 patients for whom estrogen receptor (ER) status
was known, 9 had ER-positive disease, and of the 21
for whom progesterone receptor (PR) status was

2353

known, 11 had PR-positive disease. Eighteen patients
received adjuvant chemotherapy for their primary tumor; 10 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All
patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy
received an anthracycline-based regimen, and 4 also
received an adjuvant taxane. Seven patients received
adjuvant tamoxifen.
Median time to diagnosis of distant disease
was 31 months (range, 0–153 months). Six patients
underwent resection of their metastases with curative
intent; all other patients underwent surgery with palliative intent. Distant metastases were excised from
bone (12 patients), brain (11), lung (3), liver (2), or
peritoneum (1). Ten patients received chemotherapy,
15 received endocrine therapy, and 4 received radiation therapy to the site of metastasis before metastetectomy.

Immunohistochemical Analysis
Briefly, tissue samples were processed and embedded
in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded samples were cut
into 4-micron sections and placed on poly-l-lysinecoated slides. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene,
rehydrated through graded alcohols, and transferred
to phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS). Immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of pAkt and p4EBP1 was performed by using pAkt (Ser473; #9277)
and p4E-BP1 (Ser65; #9451) rabbit polyclonal antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, Mass).
Sections were placed in a preheated antigen retrieval
solution (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif) in a steamer for
20 minutes. All samples were then blocked in 3%
H2O2 in methanol for 15 minutes and rinsed with
PBS. Slides were then placed in a Sequenza slide
staining system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
Mass) and blocked in 1% normal goat serum for
20 minutes. Slides were incubated overnight at 48C
with pAkt (1:100 concentration) or p4E-BP1 (1:50
concentration). This was followed by assay with a
standard avidin-biotin peroxidase complex ABC Elite
Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif ). Slides
were developed with diamino benzidine (Zymed Laboratories, Carlsbad, Calif) and counterstained with
10% hematoxylin. IHC conditions were optimized
using cell pellets from cell lines known to be positive
or negative for pAkt (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB435 cells) and p4E-BP1 (MCF7 cells cultured in the
absence and presence of 100 nM rapamycin). After
IHC conditions were established, the discrimination
of samples positive and negative for pAkt and p4EBP1 was confirmed by IHC of breast tumors previously shown to be positive or negative for pAkt and
p4E-BP1.5

Quantitation and Statistical Analysis
For IHC quantitation, intensity (1, 11, and 111)
and frequency were added to group the expression
into 3 categories. Tumors with no staining or 10%
of cells with (1) staining were scored as 0, tumors
with >10% of cells with (1) staining or 20% of
cells with (11/111) staining were scored as 1, and
tumors with >20% of cells with (11/111) staining
were scored as 2.5 The IHC results were interpreted
by 2 experienced breast pathologists (A.S., A.N.S.).
pAkt and p4E-BP1 status was assigned according to a
dichotomous scoring system: negative (score 0) or
positive (score 1 or 2).
Discordance between IHC results for the primary
tumor and metastasis or between the markers was
represented as percentage discordance (number discordant/total number), with a 95% confidence interval (CI), including continuity correction. Agreement
between sites or markers was evaluated with Cohen
kappa (j).

dance; 95% CI, 0.17–0.57). The j value was 0.10 (95%
CI 20.33–0.52), consistent with slight agreement.
Of the 24 primary tumors for which both pAkt
and p4E-BP1 results were available, 5 tumors had
discordance between the expression of these 2 markers (20.8% discordance; 95% CI, 0.08–0.43). Of the
26 metastases for which both pAkt and p4E-BP1
results were available, 7 were discordant (26.9% discordance; 95% CI: 0.12–0.48). Thus, the expression of the
2 markers showed moderate agreement in primary
tumors (j: 0.41; 95% CI, 20.01–0.84), and fair agreement in metastases (j: 0.28, 95% CI, 20.13–0.69).
The interobserver variability for these markers
was determined by comparing the independent
scores by 2 pathologists. The interobserver variability
for pAkt was 0.7939 (95% CI 5 0.6019–0.9860). The
interobserver variability for p4E-BP1 was 0.7195 (95%
CI 5 0.4893–0.9497). Thus, both markers showed
substantial interobserver agreement.

DISCUSSION
RESULTS
To determine whether primary tumors differ from
their metastasis in their Akt/mTOR signaling, we
assessed the expression of pAkt and p4E-BP1 on
matched surgical samples from 29 patients with
breast cancer. Twenty-five primary tumor samples
and 26 metastases were evaluable for pAkt immunostaining. Nineteen (76%) of 25 primary tumors and
20 (76%) of 26 metastatic tumors were positive for pAkt.
Of the 23 matched evaluable pairs, however, 11 pairs
were discordant (47.8%, 95% CI, 0.27–0.69) (Table 1).
Examples of discordant samples are shown in Figure 1.
The j value was 20.31 (95% CI, 20.49 to 20.13), consistent with agreement less than expected by chance.
Of the 29 pairs of matched samples, 24 primary
tumor samples and 27 metastases were evaluable for
p4E-BP1 immunostaining. Eighteen (75%) of 24 primary tumors and 20 (74%) of 27 metastatic tumors
were positive for p4E-BP1. Of the 23 matched evaluable pairs, 8 pairs were discordant (34.8% discor-

The Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is being actively
pursued as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy.
There is an urgent need, therefore, to identify robust
markers that can determine the activity of Akt/mTOR
signaling in tumors. pAkt has been widely studied as
a marker of activity of the Akt signaling pathway,
while mTOR’s phosphorylation target p4E-BP1 is pursued by many as a marker of mTORC1 activity. It
remains unknown, however, whether assessment of
these markers in the primary tumor accurately reflects
the status of metastases arising from the same tumor.
We found that, although most of the primary and metastatic tumors in our study were positive for pAkt and
p4E-BP1 by IHC, there was poor concordance between
the primary tumors and metastases.
Activation of Akt/mTOR signaling in primary
tumors is thought to represent a relatively aggressive
phenotype. pAkt expression has been evaluated in a
variety of primary tumor types.5,13–22 Most of the
published literature suggests that pAkt expression is

a marker of poor prognosis in several tumor types,
and is predictive of endocrine resistance in breast
cancer.13,14,19,20,22–24 The prognostic value of p4EBP1, in comparison to that of pAkt, has been understudied. Castellvi et al.6 recently studied the expression of pAkt and p4E-BP1 as well as EGFR, HER2,
pS6K1, and pS6 in ovarian cancers and found that
only p4E-BP1 demonstrated prognostic significance.
Using reverse-phase proteomic arrays, Petricoin
et al.25 found that high pAkt and p4E-BP1 levels were
associated with poor disease-free and overall survival
in rhabdomyosarcoma. The findings of Zhou et al.,5
who examined 165 invasive breast cancers by IHC,
were similar to ours in that 74% of invasive tumors
expressed pAkt and 72% expressed p4E-BP1. On univariate analysis, patients whose tumors expressed
high levels of pAkt and p4E-BP1 tended to have
shorter disease-free survival. Taken together, these
data suggest that pAkt and p4E-BP1 play critical roles
in cancer progression and indeed represent promising therapeutic targets.
Akt/mTOR signaling is being actively pursued as
a target of cancer therapy. Inhibitors of PI3K and Akt
are now entering into clinical trials. Rapamycin,
which inhibits mTOR by binding FK binding protein
12, is already approved for use as an immunosuppressive agent in transplant patients and is now
being investigated as an antitumor agent. Several
rapamycin analogs, including temsirolimus, everolimus (RAD001; Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland),
and AP235673 (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge,
Mass), are well on their way in clinical trials. Encouragingly, treatment with temsirolimus was associated with a survival advantage over interferonalpha in a phase 3 clinical trial in advanced renal cell
carcinoma, demonstrating the potential clinical utility of mTOR inhibitors.10 In most clinical trials performed in unselected cancer populations, however,
mTOR inhibitors as single agents have shown only
modest efficacy. In the phase 2 trial of temsirolimus
in breast cancer, for example, the objective response
rate was 9.2%.8 Thus, markers that can predict
response to inhibitors of Akt/mTOR are needed to
help select patients who are most likely to respond
to these targeted therapies. pAkt status could potentially be used to select patients who have tumors
more likely to be ‘driven by’ or ‘addicted to’ Akt activation, and thus are most likely to benefit from PI3K
or Akt inhibitors. Akt activation has been associated
with sensitivity to rapamycin and its analogs.11,12,26
Whether these markers have predictive value in the
clinic has not yet been demonstrated.
Metastatic tumors often are not easily accessible
for biopsy, and thus markers that can be assessed

reliably in the primary tumor are desirable. An ideal
marker for clinical use would be stable in its expression over time, and its expression in the primary tumor would reflect its expression in metastatic sites.
Indeed, gene profiling studies have shown that primary breast tumors are strikingly similar to distant
metastases in the same patient.27 HER2 expression
has been widely studied, and is usually concordant
between the primary tumor and different metastatic
sites.28–30 On the other hand, there are several reasons why there could be true biological differences
in biomarker expression between primary tumors
and metastases: 1) clonal divergence of biomarkers
due to metastases arising from clonal expansion of
primary tumor cells bearing additional genetic alterations; 2) differential modulation of gene expression
and cell signaling in primary tumors versus metastases by the microenvironment; and 3) gain of additional aberrations in gene expression and cell
signaling due to selection pressures imposed by adjuvant systemic therapy.31 Our study suggests that,
unlike HER2, pAkt and p4E-BP1 expression differs in
primary tumors and their metastases. Interestingly,
we expected that discordance, if any, would reflect
higher Akt/mTOR signaling in metastases due to the
increased metastatic potential of clones with activation of this pathway or due to selection pressure of
systemic therapy selecting for increased Akt/mTOR
signaling.32 Instead, we found that the same number
of patients had activation of Akt/mTOR signaling in
their primary tumor and not in the metastasis as had
activation in their metastasis but not in the primary.
Further study is needed to determine whether our
finding represents a true biological discordance and,
if so, to identify its mechanism of development.
Another possibility is that the poor concordance
between IHC findings in primary tumors and metastases in our study is a reflection of poor reproducibility of IHC with phosphospecific antibodies. There
have been several concerns about the use of phosphoproteins as biological markers of tumor signaling.
One major concern is that the staining and scoring
of the findings of IHC with phosphospecific antibodies has not yet been standardized; no studies have
yet assessed interlaboratory agreement for these
markers. An even greater concern is the stability of
phosphoproteins. Xenograft studies have shown a
rapid decrease in pAkt at room temperature, with a
calculated half-life of 20 minutes.33 In a study conducted in paraffin-embedded samples from patients
enrolled in a Southwest Oncology Group clinical
trial, pAkt (Ser473) staining was observed only in
clinical samples obtained as biopsies (9 of 13), not in
those obtained as surgical samples (0 of 15).33 Many

Akt/mTOR in Primary Tumors and Distant Metastases/Akcakanat et al.

other markers show tumor heterogeneity, however,
and it is thought that there may be a gradient of
mTOR activity due to central hypoxia in larger
tumors, raising a concern about assessing markers of
Akt/mTOR signaling on limited tumor samples
obtained though core biopsy. In this study we elected
to look at surgical samples from primary and metastatic tumors collected in the same institution to try
to minimize variation in specimen processing as well
as variability due to tumor heterogeneity. We
acknowledge that there still will be inherent variation
in tumor hypoxia times in this retrospective study
because of differing surgical procedures (eg, breast
conservation vs mastectomy vs liver resection with
vascular occlusion), as well as variation in processing
and fixation of tumor at different sites. Markers that
are robust enough to remain reproducible in spite of
these technical variations will be most useful in the
clinical setting.
The main limitation of this study is its small
sample size. This is inherent in our study group
choice, as distant metastases from breast primaries
are rarely surgically resected. It also should be noted
that most of the primary tumors in our study were
removed before systemic therapy, while most
patients received systemic therapy after the diagnosis
of metastasis. Although this study design is not optimal to capture de novo biological variations between
primary tumors and metastases, comparison of biomarker expression in primary tumors and metastases
already treated with systemic therapy better reflects
the scenario in which patients with metastatic disease will undergo biomarker testing to assess eligibility for novel targeted therapies. Further study in
larger cohorts is needed to determine whether there
is actual discordance between Akt/mTOR signaling
in primary and metastatic tumors, and whether this
is a true biological phenomenon or reflective of technical variations in IHC staining of tumors retrieved
from different sites. Further work is needed to compare tissue in paraffin with fresh-frozen samples, and
to compare IHC with newer, more quantitative technologies such as reverse-phase proteomic arrays.
Identification of robust biomarkers that can be utilized
widely with low interlaboratory variability and can
accurately assess aberrations in cell signaling and predict response to targeted therapies is critical to successful delivery of individualized cancer therapy.
