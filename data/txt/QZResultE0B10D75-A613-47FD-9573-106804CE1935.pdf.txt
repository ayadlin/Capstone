BACKGROUND: In patients with multiple myeloma, renal impairment (RI) at the time of diagnosis is associated with
poor survival. To the authors’ knowledge, the current retrospective analysis presented is the first to assess the impact
of various degrees of renal dysfunction on safety and efficacy outcomes in a large cohort of patients with relapsed
and/or refractory multiple myeloma who received treatment with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone. METHODS:
Three hundred fifty-three patients from 2 large phase 3 trials were randomized to receive lenalidomide (25 mg) plus
dexamethasone (40 mg). For the purpose of this analysis, RI was defined according to the calculated creatinine
clearance (CLCr) level as follows: mild or no RI (CLCr  60 mL/minute), moderate RI (CLCr from  30 mL/minute to
<60 mL/minute), and severe RI (CLCr <30 mL/minute). RESULTS: The RI subgroups did not differ significantly
in terms of the overall response rate (range, 50%-64%) or response quality (very good partial response or better,
27%-37%). In all RI subgroups, the time to progression and progression-free survival did not differ significantly compared with the mild or no RI group. Patients with RI experienced an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia,
required more frequent lenalidomide dose reduction or interruption, and had shorter overall survival than patients
with mild or no RI (P ¼ .006). Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone led to improvement in renal function in the majority
of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study indicated that, with careful monitoring of the CLCr level and
adverse events as well as appropriate dose adjustments, lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is an effective and well

Approximately 20% of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) present with renal failure.1

Moreover, this end-organ damage is the second most common cause of death in patients with MM.2 Cast nephropathy,
the most common cause of myeloma-associated renal injury, occurs in at least 30% of patients.2,3 Other causes of renal
impairment (RI) in patients with MM include acute tubulopathy, amyloid light-chain amyloidosis, light-chain deposition
disease, tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with monotypic light-chain deposits, and plasma cell tumor nodules.2 In
addition, hypercalcemia, which may impact renal function, occurs in 33% of newly diagnosed patients.4-6 The degree of

RI is usually mild to moderate (ie, plasma creatinine >1.3
mg/dL and <2 mg/dL) in approximately 50% of patients;
however, severe RI (plasma creatinine 2 mg/dL) may be
observed in 15% to 20% of patients at diagnosis.3,5-7
Effective myeloma control and resultant reduction
in urinary light-chain excretion can lead to improvement
in RI in 50% to 60% of patients.3,6,8,9 Although patients
with MM who have persistent RI often have inferior survival, recovery of renal function, often made possible
through novel drugs that better control the disease, is associated with an improvement in outcome.4 In patients
with RI, drugs known as nephrotoxic should be avoided
whenever possible. Medications that are excreted renally
typically need dose and/or schedule adjustment to reduce
the risk of side effects.10,11
Lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone is an
effective treatment for MM that provides an overall
response (OR) rate of 60% with a complete response
(CR) rate of 15%, in patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM.12,13 Two-thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion.14 To our
knowledge, the retrospective analysis presented here is
the first to assess the impact of various degrees of renal
dysfunction on safety and efficacy outcomes with lenalidomide, such as OR, time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and
improvements in renal function, in a large cohort of
patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM who
received lenalidomide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In total, 704 patients who met the entry criteria were
enrolled in MM-009 and MM-010, 2 large, phase 3,
randomized, multicenter clinical trials that compared
treatment with lenalidomide (25 mg daily on Days 121 of each 28-day cycle) plus dexamethasone (40 mg on
Days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 every 28 days for 4 cycles
and 40 mg on Days 1-4 every cycle thereafter) versus
dexamethasone alone (identical schedule).12,13 Treatment was continued until patients developed either
unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Toxicity
was graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0, as reported
previously.12,13
Three hundred fifty-three patients who were
randomized to receive lenalidomide plus dexamethasone
in these 2 trials12,13 were included in the current subgroup
analysis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were published

3808

previously.12,13 Entry criteria for renal function were
based on serum creatinine levels. All patients were
required to have a baseline serum creatinine level <2.5
mg/dL. Renal function was assessed throughout the
course of the study by measuring serum creatinine levels.
For the purpose of the present RI analysis, renal function
was assessed by using the serum creatinine level to calculate creatinine clearance (CLCr) with the Cockroft-Gault
equation. Then, patients were subdivided into RI subgroups based on their CLCr values, defined as follows:
mild or no RI, CLCr 60 mL/minute; moderate RI, CLCr
30 mL/minute and <60 mL/minute; or severe RI, CLCr
<30 mL/minute.15
The objective of the current analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of therapy, safety, and tolerability with
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients who had
mild or no RI compared with patients who had moderate and severe RI. Response to treatment was assessed
according to the modified European Group for Blood
and Marrow Transplantation criteria for CR and partial response (PR), according to criteria described by
the International Myeloma Working Group for a very
good PR (VGPR).16,17 TTP was measured from the
date of randomization to the date of the first assessment that identified disease progression. Patients who
died or discontinued the study without evidence of disease progression were censored at the last evaluation
for assessment of TTP. PFS was measured from the
date of randomization to the date of the first assessment that identified disease progression or the date of
death during treatment, whichever occurred first.
Patients who were alive and discontinued study therapy
without evidence of disease progression were censored
at the last evaluation for assessment of PFS. OS was
measured from the date of randomization to the date
of death from any cause or was censored at the last follow-up.
Data on OR (CR þ VGPR þ PR), TTP, and PFS
were assessed up to unblinding, which occurred in June
2005 for MM-009 and August 2005 for MM-010, for a
median follow-up duration of 17.5 months. The cutoff
for follow-up data on OS was January 2007, with a median follow-up duration of 31.3 months.
Differences in OR rates were analyzed using continuity-corrected Pearson chi-square tests. Time-to-event
variables with censoring, including TTP, PFS, and OS,
were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Twosided log-rank tests were used for comparisons of TTP,
PFS, and OS.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Of the 353 patients who were randomized to receive lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, baseline CLCr data were
available for 341 patients. Of these patients, 243 (71%)
had mild or no RI (CLCr 60 mL/minute), 82 (24%) had
moderate RI (CLCr 30 mL/minute and <60 mL/minute), and 16 (5%) had severe RI (CLCr <30 mL/minute). According to protocol exclusion criteria, all
patients who were included in this analysis had a relatively
low serum creatinine level (<2.5 mg/dL), although 16
patients had severe RI. Patients who had RI were older,
more likely to be women, and had higher serum b2-microglobulin levels compared with patients who did not have
RI (all P < .05) (Table 1). Besides this, renal function subgroups were balanced (Table 1).
Efficacy
There were no statistical differences in OR rates between
the 3 subgroups (Table 2). Moreover, the quality of
response did not differ by severity of RI. A VGPR or better was achieved in 34% of patients with mild or no RI, in
27% of patients with moderate RI, and in 38% of patients
with severe RI (P ¼ not significant [NS] for both). The
TTP was similar in patients with mild or no RI (median,
12.0 months) and patients with moderate RI (median,
11.1 months) (Table 2). Patients who had severe RI had a
shorter TTP; however, the difference was not significant
compared with patients who had mild or no RI (median,

7.8 months; P ¼ NS). Similarly, PFS did not differ significantly between patients who had mild or no RI (median,
11.1 months) and patients who had moderate RI (median, 9.5 months; P ¼ NS) or severe RI (median, 7.8
months; P ¼ NS) (Table 2, Fig. 1).
After a median follow-up of 31.3 months, OS was
38.9 months for patients who had mild or no RI (Table
2). Patients who had moderate or severe RI tended to have
shorter OS (29.0 months and 18.4 months, respectively),
and this was significantly shorter compared with the OS
of patients who had mild or no RI (P ¼ .006 for both)
(Table 2, Fig. 2).
Improvement in Renal Function
Improvement in CLCr by at least 1 level (ie, mild or no
RI, moderate RI, or severe RI as described above; see
Materials and Methods) was experienced by 68 of 94
patients (72%) with moderate-to-severe RI who received
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone; whereas, of all those
who received lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, only 3
patients (1%) had a worsening CLCr by at least 1 level
(Table 3).
Safety
Neutropenia was the most common grade 3 or 4 hematologic adverse event, and the rates of neutropenia were similar across all subgroups of renal function (32%, 48%, and
38% of patients with mild or no RI, moderate RI, and
severe RI, respectively) (Table 4). Renal impairment was
not associated with a higher incidence of fever or

patients with moderate RI (40%) and severe RI (38%)
required a lenalidomide dose reduction or interruption
because of adverse events than patients with mild or no RI
(22%; P < .05). The median time to lenalidomide dose
reduction was 99 days, 85 days, and 78 days for patients
with mild or no RI, moderate RI, and severe RI, respectively. Overall, lenalidomide discontinuation because of
adverse events (in almost all patients because of cytopenias) increased with the severity of RI and was significantly more frequent for patients with severe RI (38%)
than for patients with mild or no RI (12%; P < .05).

DISCUSSION
Renal impairment is a frequent complication in patients
with MM, and its incidence increases in patients with
recurrent disease and as the disease becomes refractory to
treatment.1 Two large, prospective randomized trials,
MM-009 and MM-010, established the significant activity of combination lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in
patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM.12,13
Although lenalidomide is excreted renally, many patients
with advanced myeloma and RI may not have any other
treatment option. This frequent clinical complication
prompted a retrospective analysis of data from MM-009
and MM-010 to evaluate the effects of RI on patient outcomes. The results from the current subgroup analysis
demonstrate that the combination of lenalidomide plus
dexamethasone is effective in patients with all degrees of
renal dysfunction. Renal impairment at the time of diagnosis is associated with poor survival in patients with
MM.6,9 Persistent renal failure is associated with an
increased risk of morbidity and early mortality.18,19 In 1
study, the median survival was an additional 6 months for
patients who had reversible renal failure compared with
patients who had irreversible renal injury, indicating that
renal improvement may be associated with improved
long-term survival.6 Thus, the reversibility of renal failure

3812

may be an important prognostic factor, perhaps as important as quality of response to therapy, for patients with
RI.6,9 The improvement in RI to a near-normal range
(CLCr 60 mL/minute) observed in the majority of
patients in the current study suggests that lenalidomide
plus dexamethasone may be a particularly useful therapy
in this setting.
In the current study, TTP and PFS did not differ
significantly between patients who had mild or no RI
compared with patients who had RI. However, patients
who had severe RI (CLCr <30 mL/minute) tended to
have shorter PFS and a trend toward shorter TTP.
Patients who had moderate or severe RI had significantly
shorter OS (29.0 months and 18.4 months, respectively)
compared with patients who had mild or no RI (38.9
months; P ¼ .006 for both). Furthermore, more patients
who had severe RI discontinued therapy because of
adverse events (predominantly cytopenias). These differences may be associated with treatment schedule: Patients
with moderate RI received a median daily dose of 25 mg,
similar to patients with mild or no RI, and patients with
severe RI received a median daily dose of 15 mg; thus,
patients with severe RI may have received longer treatment and greater benefit at a lower starting and treatment
dose, consistent with the recent dosing adjustment recommendations for this patient population (Table 6).
The time to dose reduction appeared to be shorter
for patients who had RI compared with patients who had
mild or no RI, and those who had moderate or severe RI
required significantly more frequent intervention because
of anemia and thrombocytopenia than those with mild or
no RI. Although thrombocytopenia was more pronounced, there were no bleeding events. Other adverse
events generally occurred with similar frequencies in
patients with and without RI.
The current study highlights the limitations of using
the serum creatinine level as a measure of patient renal
function, because a subset of eligible patients (serum

LenþDex in Relapsed MM With RI/Dimopoulos et al

creatinine <2.5 mg/dL) had severe RI (CLCr <30 mL/
minute) and a greater frequency of certain treatmentrelated adverse events. Because renal clearance may be
reduced by 35% to 50% without evidence of renal disease
in elderly patients, dosage adjustments are necessary for
renally excreted drugs. In addition, because creatinine
production is lower in elderly individuals due to decreased
muscle mass and because serum creatinine may be normal
despite impaired CLCr, it is recommended to base dosage
adjustments on CLCr instead of serum creatinine (Table
6).20 By using CLCr as a guide for dosing patients with
MM who have RI, Chen and colleagues14 studied the
effect of RI on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide after
a single 25-mg oral dose (patients aged 39-76 years) in
patients without cancer. Those authors demonstrated
that, in study participants who had increased baseline RI,
renal lenalidomide clearance decreased substantially, prolonging its half-life by approximately 6 to 12 hours.14 An
80% decrease in lenalidomide clearance was observed in
patients with RI compared with healthy individuals, and
that decrease corresponded to the primary renal route of
drug excretion.14 Since this analysis, adjustments to the
initial dose of lenalidomide have been recommended in
patients with moderate RI (CLCr 30 mL/minute and
<60 mL/minute) or severe RI (CLCr <30 mL/minute not
requiring dialysis) and end-stage renal failure (CLCr 30
mL/minute and <60 mL/minute requiring dialysis). On
the basis of a pharmacokinetic study in patients who had
RI caused by nonmalignant conditions, the recommendations for the starting dose of lenalidomide in patients with
MM who have RI to maintain appropriate exposure are
shown in Table 6.20,21
In conclusion, lenalidomide plus dexamethasone led
to improvement in RI in the majority of patients in the
current analysis. With careful monitoring of CLCr levels
and adverse events and with appropriate dose adjustments, lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is a highly effective treatment and is well tolerated in patients with MM
who have RI. Platelet counts also should be monitored
carefully, because we observed more marked thrombocytopenia in patients who had a CLCr <30 mL/minute,
although there did not appear to be any increased incidence of bleeding in the 16 patients in the current study.
Formal studies confirming the efficacy of lenalidomide in
patients with renal failure are warranted and ongoing.
Currently, 2 trials are recruiting for the study of lenalidomide treatment in patients with MM who have RI. These
include a study of the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide
in patients with MM who have RI (National Clinical

Trial [NCT] 00779922) and a phase 1/2 trial of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone in patients with
relapsed and/or refractory MM and RI (NCT00790842).
For future studies and therapy with lenalidomide, it is important to convert serum creatinine to CLCr and to use
CLCr for dosage adjustments, as recommended in Table
6, for patients with RI.
