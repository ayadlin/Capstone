Abstract
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1
(MKP-1) is the MAPK phosphatase family member that
negatively regulates MAPK signaling. Our previous study
showed that MKP-1 is involved in cisplatin resistance, but
the mechanism underlying its resistance is not understood.
Here, we show that ERK2-mediated MKP-1 expression is
critical for cisplatin resistance. Specifically, we showed that in
the human ovarian cancer cell lines, cisplatin induces MKP-1
through phosphorylation. We also showed that inhibition of
ERK2 activity by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or by small
interfering RNA silencing decreases MKP-1 induction, leading
to an increase in cisplatin-induced cell death, which mimicked
the results obtained with cells in which MKP-1 is downregulated. Importantly, down-regulation of ERK2 decreased
cisplatin-induced MKP-1 phosphorylation, suggesting that
MKP-1 phosphorylation depends on ERK2 activity. Furthermore, down-regulation of ERK2 or MKP-1 enhanced cisplatininduced apoptosis. In addition, we showed that down-regulation
of ERK2 or MKP-1 decreases the basal level of Bcl-2 protein
and that inhibition of Bcl-2 activity sensitizes ovarian cancer
cells to cisplatin. Collectively, our results indicate that
induction of MKP-1 by cisplatin is through phosphorylation
involving ERK signaling and that MKP-1 plays a critical role
in ERK-mediated cisplatin resistance. Thus, our results
suggest that targeting ERK-MKP-1 signaling could overcome
cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Ovarian carcinoma is the fifth most common cause of cancer
deaths among women in the United States. The current available
therapies that are for the most part palliative are not very effective,
but some progress is being made with neoadjuvant approaches
including the use of cisplatin to improve the survival of patients
with locally advanced disease. The major obstacle in ovarian cancer
chemotherapy including cisplatin is the development of resistant
cell populations following the relapse of an initially responsive
malignancy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand
chemoresistance including cisplatin resistance. Cisplatin is the first
line drug for treating epithelial ovarian cancer. Although the
mechanism underlying its anticancer activity is incompletely
defined, it is generally accepted that cisplatin is a DNA-damaging

agent that forms cisplatin-DNA adducts that kill cells by the
activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It is believed that
cisplatin-induced cancer cell apoptosis involves the activation of
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (1).
Mammalian MAPK pathways mainly consist of three subfamilies:
the p38 MAPK, the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), and the
stress-activated protein [c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK)/
SAPK]. These MAPKs can be activated by diverse stimuli including
growth factors and cellular/extracellular stresses. In response to
stimuli, MAPKs are activated through the reversible phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues of the TXY motif in
the catalytic domain by upstream dual-specificity kinases. These
upstream MAPK kinases (MKK) include MKK1/2, MKK3/6, and
MKK-4/7, which are in turn activated by MAPK kinase kinases (2–4).
Specifically, MKK3/6 activate p38 and MKK4/7 activate JNK,
whereas MKK1/2 activate ERK (3, 5, 6). Activated MAPKs can
phosphorylate a number of substrates and subsequently activate
many signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and apoptosis
(3). It is believed that activation of ERK tends to the induction of cell
proliferation, whereas activation of JNK and p38 favors the
induction of cell death. Because phosphorylation is a critical event
for the activation of MAPKs, dephosphorylation of MAPKs by
members of the MAPK phosphatase (MKP) family plays a critical
role in negatively regulating MAPK signaling.
The MAPK phosphatases are a family of dual-specificity protein
phosphatases (DUSP; ref. 7). Eleven members of MKPs have
been identified thus far, including MKP-1, MKP-2, MKP-3, MKP-4,
MKP-5, MKP-7, MKP-X, PAC1, hVH3, M3/6, and MK-STYX (8).
These MKPs can dephosphorylate both phosphorylated threonine
and phosphorylated tyrosine residues and thus inactivate MAPK
activities (7). MKP-1 is the founding member of the DUSP family.
MKP-1 was originally cloned as a growth factor–inducible gene
(9, 10), which could also be induced by stresses (11–13). It has been
shown that MKP-1 can inactivate ERK, JNK, and p38 (12, 14–16).
Because the activation of JNK, p38, and ERK can induce apoptosis
or cell proliferation, MKP-1 is shown to be involved in regulating
the cell cycle (17–20) and apoptosis (21–23). For example, MKP-1
could protect cells from anisomycin-induced apoptosis (24). Our
recent study showed that MKP-1 is induced by cisplatin in human
lung cancer cell lines and that the induction of MKP-1 plays an
important role in cisplatin resistance (25).
In this article, we showed that cisplatin activates ERK and
induces MKP-1 expression. Induction of MKP-1 by cisplatin is
through phosphorylation. Inhibition of ERK activity by the
pharmacologic inhibitor U0126 abolished MKP-1 induction.
Furthermore, knockdown of ERK2 by small interfering RNA
(siRNA) decreased MKP-1 phosphorylation caused by cisplatin,
leading to an increase in cisplatin-induced ovarian cancer cell
death, which is consistent with the result obtained with cells in
which MKP-1 is down-regulated. Importantly, we showed that
knockdown of ERK2 or MKP-1 decreases the basal level of Bcl-2

expression, which may suggest the underlying mechanism of
cisplatin resistance. Taken together, our results identify a new
mechanism by which ERK2-MKP-1 signaling is responsible for
cisplatin resistance and suggest that targeting ERK-MKP-1
signaling may overcome cisplatin resistance in human ovarian
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Cisplatin and antiactin antibody (AC-74) were purchased from
Sigma. The MEK inhibitor U0126 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 were
purchased from Promega. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 and mouse anti–
Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Calbiochem. Gossypol was
obtained from AXXORA. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human MKP-1 antibody was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies
against total and phosphorylated ERK, p38, JNK, cyclic AMP–responsive
element-binding (CREB) protein, c-Jun, caspase-3, PARP, and phosphorylated MKP-1 at Ser359 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Cell lines, culture conditions, and treatment. The human ovarian
cancer cell lines OVCA432, TOV112D, CAOV3, OVCA420, OV433, and
RMG-1 were kindly provided by Dr. Samuel Mok (Brigham and Women’s
Hospital, Boston, MA), as described previously (26). All cell lines were
maintained in MCDB105/M199 except CAOV3, which was maintained in
DMEM. These cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and
95% air. Cells were treated with various concentrations of cisplatin for
different periods of time as indicated in each figure legend.
siRNA transfection for knockdown of MKP-1 and ERK2. OnTARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs for MKP-1, ERK2, and corresponding
control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon Research. The transfection
was performed as suggested by Dharmacon with slight modifications, as
described previously (25). Briefly, OV433 cells were plated at 6  105 cells
per well in six-well plates. The next day, cells were transfected with ERK2,
MKP-1 siRNA oligonucleotides or non-target control oligonucleotides using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 3 days, transfected cells were left
untreated or treated with cisplatin (50 Ag/mL) for 6 h and then harvested to
examine the expression of ERK2 and MKP-1 protein using Western blot
analysis. To determine cisplatin sensitivity, transfected cells were placed at
8,000 cells per well in 96-well plates and then treated with or without
cisplatin (20 or 50 Ag/mL) for 24 h, and cell viability was determined
by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assays.
MTT assay. The MTT assay was done as previously described (27).
Briefly, cells were left untreated or pretreated with 10 Amol/L of SP600125,
10 Amol/L of U0126, or 10 Amol/L of SB203580 for 30 min, and then treated
with cisplatin. After incubation with MTT solution, isopropanol was added
to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorbance was measured using a Vmax
Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) at 590 nm. Survival was calculated
from the mean of pooled data from three separate experiments with five
wells (27).
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared as described
previously (28), and protein concentration was determined using the
Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates (100 Ag) were electrophoresed
through 12% or 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were probed or
reprobed with the antibodies, and bound antibody was detected using
enhanced chemiluminescence or ECLplus Reagent (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Assay of MKP-1 phosphatase activity. MKP-1 activity was measured
using immunoprecipitated MKP-1. Immunoprecipitation was performed
as described previously (29) with slight modification. Briefly, cells were
lysed in lysis buffer, and 500 Ag of supernatant protein was incubated
with 2 Ag of antiphosphorylated MKP-1 antibody or IgG at 4jC for 2 h,
followed by incubation with protein A/G PLUS for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with cell lysis buffer. The precipitates were
used to measure MKP-1 phosphatase activity. Phosphatase activities of

immunoprecipitated MKP-1 were analyzed as described previously (30)
using pNPP protein phosphatase assay kit from AnaSpec according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 50 AL of the pNPP reaction mixture
was added to 50 AL of MKP-1 immunoprecipitates and the reaction was
performed at 30jC for 1 h. Absorbance measured at 405 nm was obtained
in a microplate reader. Nonspecific hydrolysis of pNPP was assessed in
IgG immunoprecipitates, which served as a control.
Assay of caspase-3 activity. The enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was
assayed using the caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit (R&D Systems) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells left untreated or treated with
cisplatin for 24 h and then lysed in lysis buffer for 10 min on ice. The lysed
cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and 100 Ag of protein was
incubated with 20 AL of reaction buffer and 10 AL of caspase-3 substrate at
37jC for 1 h, and absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm on a
plate reader.

ERK and MKP-1 in Cisplatin Resistance
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s
t test. The data were presented as the mean F SD, and P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
Cisplatin induces MKP-1 in a panel of human ovarian
cancer cell lines. Our previous study indicated that cisplatin
induces MKP-1, which plays an important role in cisplatin resistance in the lung cancer cell line H460 (25). Because cisplatin is the
first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, it is
possible that such a mechanism also applies to ovarian cancer. To
this end, we treated a panel of human ovarian cancer cell lines
including OVCA432, TOV112D, CAOV3, OVCA420, OV433, and
RMG-1 with 50 Ag/mL of cisplatin for different periods of time, and
induction of MKP-1 protein was determined by Western blot

10 Amol/L of SP600125 (SP ) for 30 min and then treated with 50 Ag/mL of
cisplatin (Cis ) for 6 h, and total protein was then extracted for measuring MKP-1
protein using Western blot analysis. Actin was used as a loading control. B, role

were left untreated or pretreated with MAPK inhibitors for 30 min as described
in A and then treated with 10 Ag/mL of cisplatin for 24 h, and cell viability was

analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, MKP-1 protein was increased in all
the cell lines tested with different kinetics. MKP-1 was dramatically
increased 3 h after cisplatin treatment in TOV112D, CAOV3,
OVCA420, and RMG-1 cells. Such an induction was observed only
after 1- to 6-h cisplatin treatments in OVCA432 cells, whereas
MKP-1 was gradually increased by cisplatin in OV433 cells. These
data suggest that induction of MKP-1 by cisplatin is a general event
in human ovarian cancer cell lines. To determine their cisplatin
sensitivities, we treated these cell lines with various doses of
cisplatin for 24 h, and the effect of cisplatin on growth was
determined by MTT assays. Figure 1B shows that cisplatin inhibits
the growth of all the cell lines in a dose-dependent manner; OV433
and RMG-1 were the most resistant lines, whereas CAOV3 was the
most sensitive line (Fig. 1B).
The role of MAPKs in MKP-1 induction by cisplatin. It has
been shown that MKP-1 expression can be regulated by ERK, p38,
and JNK (12, 31, 32). Our previous study indicated that ERK might
be involved in MKP-1 induction by cisplatin in human lung cancer
cell line H460 (25). To determine which MAPK is involved in
cisplatin-induced MKP-1 expression in ovarian cancer cells, six
ovarian lines were left untreated or treated with the MEK1/2
inhibitor U0126 (10 Amol/L), the p38 inhibitor SB203580
(10 Amol/L), or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 Amol/L) for
30 min and then treated with 50 Ag/mL of cisplatin for 6 h, and the
expression of MKP-1 was determined by Western blot analysis. As
expected, cisplatin induced MKP-1 in all cell lines tested and the
induction of MKP-1 was inhibited or abrogated by either U0126 or
SB203580 (Fig. 2A). U0126 inhibited MKP-1 induction in OV433 and
RMG-1 cells and reduced its induction in CAOV3, OVCA420, and
TOV112D cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the induction of MKP-1 in
these lines is dependent on ERK. In addition, we found that MKP-1
induction was inhibited or abrogated by SB203580 in CAOV3,
OVCA432, and RMG-1 cells (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, SP600125 had
no effects on MKP-1 induction by cisplatin (Fig. 2A), suggesting
that JNK may not play a role in regulating MKP-1 expression under
this condition.
To determine the consequence of inhibition of MAPKs in
cisplatin-induced death, all six cell lines were left untreated or
pretreated with U0126, SB203580, or SP600125 for 30 min and then
treated with 10 Ag/mL of cisplatin for 24 h, and cell viability was
determined by MTT assays. As shown in Fig. 2B, cisplatin inhibited
the growth of all cell lines to different degrees, and U0126 alone
had minimal or no effect on their growth. In contrast, inhibition of
ERK signaling by U0126 enhanced cisplatin-induced death in
OVCA432, OV433, and RMG-1 cells, but not in the rest of cell lines.
These data indicate that ERK signaling may be important for
cisplatin resistance in OVCA432, OV433, and RMG-1 cells. We also
found that in both RMG-1 and TOV112D cells, SB203580 has some
effect on cisplatin-induced death (Fig. 2B). In addition, inhibition of
JNK signaling by SP600125 increased cisplatin-induced death in
CAOV3 cells (Fig. 2B).
Cisplatin induces MKP-1 and activates MAPKs in human
ovarian cancer cell lines. To determine the effect of cisplatin on
both MKP-1 induction and MAPK activation, OV433 cells were
treated with 50 Ag/mL of cisplatin for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 h, and
induction of MKP-1 and activation of MAPK signaling were then
determined. Of note, we chose the OV433 cell line because blocking
ERK in this cell line correlated with both decreased MKP-1
induction and increased cisplatin-induced cell death, whereas
either U0126 or SB203580 could inhibit MKP-1 induction and
increase cell death in both RMG-1 and TOV112D cells, suggesting

not shown). Importantly, MKP-1 phosphatase activity was also
increased following cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3B). In addition,
cisplatin treatment caused phosphorylation of ERK, p38, JNK,
CREB, and c-Jun, indicating that cisplatin activates all three MAPK
pathways. Interestingly, the activation of ERK was detected after a
5-h exposure to cisplatin, whereas MKP-1 induction was evident at
10 h following cisplatin treatment while activation of both JNK and
p38 occurred relatively later as compared with ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). It seems that activation of ERK precedes MKP-1
induction, which suggests that ERK may be an upstream activator
of MKP-1 in response to cisplatin treatment.
Blockade of ERK activation by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126
abrogates MKP-1 induction, leading to an increase in
cisplatin-induced cell death. To determine the role of ERK in
MKP-1 induction, OV433 cells were left untreated or treated with
U0126, SB203580, or SP600125 for 30 min and then treated with
50 Ag/mL of cisplatin for 6 h, and induction of MKP-1 and activation
of MAPKs were determined. As shown in Fig. 4A, cisplatin induced

that ERK may be the only MAPK that plays a role in MKP-1
induction in OV433 cells (Fig. 2). Figure 3A shows that cisplatin
treatment increases the levels of total and phosphorylated MKP-1
protein (Fig. 3A), suggesting that an increase in MKP-1 protein may
be due to its phosphorylation by cisplatin. We also found that
cisplatin treatment increases the half-life of MKP-1 protein (data

MKP-1 and such an induction was blocked by U0126, whereas
neither SB203580 nor SP600125 had any effects on MKP-1
induction. As expected, cisplatin treatment resulted in the
activation of all three MAPK signaling pathways, as exemplified
by the appearance of phosphorylated ERK, CREB, and c-Jun
(Fig. 4A). To determine the effect of MAPK inhibitors on cisplatin
sensitivity, OV433 cells pretreated with U0126, SB203580, or

following 50 Ag/mL of cisplatin treatment, >70% of cells treated

survival in cells pretreated with U0126 over cells treated with
cisplatin alone (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with cells
treated with 20 Ag/mL of cisplatin (data not shown). However,
increased cisplatin sensitivity was not observed in cells pretreated
with SB203580 or SP600125. Taken together, these data suggest that
ERK-MKP-1 signaling plays a critical role in cisplatin resistance.
Knockdown of either ERK2 or MKP-1 by siRNA silencing
increases cisplatin-induced death. Although U0126 is a specific
inhibitor for MEK1/2, it is possible that U0126 may affect other
kinases that indirectly affect ERK activation. To directly address the
role of ERK in MKP-1–mediated cisplatin resistance, OV433 cells
were transfected with either non-target control siRNA or siRNA
against ERK2, and the effect of ERK2 knockdown on cisplatin
sensitivity was determined. As shown in Fig. 5A, total ERK2 in cells
transfected with ERK2 siRNA was decreased significantly as
compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. Furthermore,
cisplatin-induced ERK2 phosphorylation was abrogated in cells
transfected with ERK2 siRNA (Fig. 5A). Importantly, phosphorylated MKP-1 was decreased in ERK2 siRNA-transfected cells as
compared with cells transfected with control siRNA following
cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5A), suggesting that ERK2 indeed plays an
important role in MKP-1 phosphorylation and induction by
cisplatin. As expected, cisplatin treatment caused ERK, p38,
and JNK phosphorylation in cells transfected with control siRNA
(Fig. 5A). Interestingly, knockdown of ERK2 seemed to have no
effect on both p38 and JNK phosphorylation by cisplatin (Fig. 5A).
To further investigate the role of ERK-MKP-1 signaling in
regulating MAPKs, we used siRNA silencing to knock down MKP-1
expression and the effect of knockdown of MKP-1 on cell death was
determined. Figure 5A shows that the levels of MKP-1 in cells
transfected with MKP-1 siRNA were decreased significantly as
compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. Furthermore,
induction of MKP-1 by cisplatin in cells transfected with MKP-1
siRNA was abolished as compared with cells transfected with
control siRNA. More importantly, phosphorylated MKP-1 was also
decreased in cells transfected with MKP-1 siRNA as compared with
cells transfected with control siRNA following cisplatin treatment.
As expected, cisplatin treatment resulted in an increase in ERK,
p38, and JNK phosphorylation in cells transfected with control
siRNA (Fig. 5A). In contrast, knockdown of MKP-1 by siRNA
silencing resulted in much higher levels of phosphorylated ERK,
p38, and JNK, particularly the level of JNK, as compared with that
in cells transfected with control siRNA. Thus, these data strongly
suggest that MKP-1 plays an important role in negatively regulating
all three major MAPK activities following cisplatin treatment.
To determine the effect of knockdown of ERK2 or MKP-1 on
cisplatin sensitivity, OV433 cells were transfected with ERK2 siRNA,
MKP-1 siRNA, or control siRNA and then treated with cisplatin
(50 Ag/mL) for 15 h, and cell viability was determined by MTT
assays. As shown in Fig. 5B, 50 Ag/mL of cisplatin treatment caused
f20% growth inhibition in cells transfected with control siRNA. In
contrast, such treatment caused f40% growth inhibition in cells
transfected with MKP-1 siRNA, which is consistent with the role of
MKP-1 in cisplatin resistance (25). Increased cisplatin sensitivity in
cells transfected with MKP-1 siRNA was also observed following
20 Ag/mL of cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5B). Importantly, knockdown
of ERK2 also increased cisplatin sensitivity to the same extent as
that observed in cells transfected with MKP-1 siRNA (Fig. 5B).
Thus, these data strongly suggest that the ERK-dependent MKP-1–
mediated pathway is critical for cisplatin resistance in human
ovarian cancer cell OV433.

Figure 6. Effect of ERK2 inhibition or knockdown and MKP-1 knockdown on cisplatin-induced apoptosis. A and B, OV433 cells were left untreated or pretreated
with U0126 (10 Amol/L) for 30 min and then treated with cisplatin (50 Ag/mL) for 24 h. Treated cells were harvested to measure the cleavage of PARP (A ) and caspase-3
activity (B). C and D, OV433 cells were plated in six-well plates and transfected with ERK2 siRNA (siERK2 ), MKP-1 siRNA (siMKP-1), or non-target siRNA
(Non-target ) using LipofectAMINE 2000. After 3 d, cells were treated with or without 50 Ag/mL of cisplatin for 24 h and then harvested to measure caspase-3 and PARP
cleavage (C ) and caspase-3 activity (D ). Data are representative of three independent experiments. **, P < 0.001, statistically significant.

Inhibition of ERK2-MKP-1 signaling increases apoptotic cell
death by cisplatin. It has been known that cisplatin kills cancer
cells in part by apoptosis (1). To determine the effect of blockade of
the ERK-MKP-1 pathway on apoptosis, OV433 cells were transfected with either ERK2 or MKP-1 siRNA to either down-regulate
ERK or MKP-1 expression, or treated with U0126 to block ERK
activation, and the effects of such treatments on cisplatin-induced
apoptosis were determined. As shown in Fig. 6A, cisplatin alone did
not cause PARP cleavage, a hallmark of apoptosis. However, cells
pretreated with U0126, which is able to block ERK signaling,
underwent cisplatin-induced apoptosis as exemplified by an
increase in PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activity. These data
suggest that inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway enhances
cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death. Consistent with the results
obtained with U0126, knockdown of ERK2 by siRNA also increased
cisplatin-induced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage and caspase-3
activity, as compared with cells transfected with control siRNA.
Similarly, knockdown of MKP-1 also enhanced cisplatin-induced
caspase-3 and PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activity, although such
changes were not evident in cells transfected with control siRNA
(Fig. 6C and D). Thus, our data indicate that ERK-MKP-1 signaling
is a survival pathway that protects cells from cisplatin-induced
apoptosis, which leads to cisplatin resistance.

Knockdown of ERK2 or MKP-1 correlates with downregulation of the basal level of Bcl-2 expression. It has been
shown that Bcl-2 is an ERK target that plays a role in protecting
cells from apoptosis (33). We have shown that down-regulation of
ERK2 or MKP-1 increases cisplatin-induced death of OV433 cells
(Fig. 5B). It is possible that Bcl-2 may play a role in ERK2-MKP-1–
mediated cisplatin resistance. To test this possibility, OV433 cells
were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA against ERK2 or
MKP-1. The effect of siRNA-mediated ERK2 or MKP-1 knockdown
on Bcl-2 expression was determined. As shown in Fig. 7A, the levels
of ERK2 and MKP-1 in cells transfected with corresponding siRNA
were decreased compared with cells transfected with control
siRNA. Importantly, the basal levels of Bcl-2 were decreased in cells
transfected with either ERK2 or MKP-1 siRNA as compared with
cells transfected with control siRNA. Interestingly, transfections of
ERK2-siRNA resulted in a more significant decrease in the levels of
Bcl-2 protein as compared with cells transfected with MKP-1
siRNA. In addition, we found that cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer
cells have a higher level of Bcl-2 protein as compared with their
sensitive cells (data not shown). These data suggest that Bcl-2 may
be a downstream target of ERK-MKP-1 signaling. To determine the
role of Bcl-2 in cisplatin sensitivity, we treated OV433 cells with the
Bcl-2 inhibitor Gossypol in the presence or absence of cisplatin for

24 h, and cisplatin sensitivity was determined. As expected,
Gossypol treatment did not affect Bcl-2 expression, as compared
with untreated cells (Fig. 7B). In addition, Gossypol did not affect
the levels of MKP-1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the combination
of Gossypol with cisplatin enhanced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage

as compared with cells treated with either agent alone (Fig. 7B).
Importantly, we showed that Gossypol increases cisplatin-induced
death as compared with either cisplatin or Gossypol alone
(Fig. 7C). Therefore, our results suggest that Bcl-2 plays a protective
role in cisplatin-induced death in the ovarian cancer cell OV433.

inhibition on cisplatin sensitivity. A, the role of ERK2 or MKP-1 knockdown in
Bcl-2 expression. OV433 cells were transfected with non-target, ERK2, or MKP-1
siRNA as described in Fig. 5A. After 3 d, cells were collected and total protein
was extracted to measure the levels of MKP-1, ERK1/2, and Bcl-2 using
Western blot analysis. Actin was included as a loading control. B, enhanced

In this study, we showed that ERK2-dependent MKP-1 induction
is critical for cisplatin resistance. Specifically, we showed that
knockdown of ERK2 decreases MKP-1 phosphorylation and
induction, leading to increased cisplatin sensitivity. Furthermore,
we showed that knockdown of either ERK2 or MKP-1 results in a
decrease in Bcl-2 expression. Thus, these findings indicate that the
ERK2/MKP-1 pathway is important for the negative regulation of
cisplatin-mediated sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells.
MKP-1 is the founding member of the MAPK phosphatase
family that can be induced by a variety of stimuli, including growth
factors, oxidative damage, UV, and anticancer agents (9, 11–13,
24, 28). Induction of MKP-1 by these stimuli can be regulated by
MAPKs including ERK, p38, and JNK. It has been shown that
MKP-1 induction in response to arsenite and lipopolysaccharide
treatment was mediated by the MAPK pathways, which was
blocked by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the p38 inhibitor
SB203580 (12, 31). Our previous study showed that MKP-1 was
induced by cisplatin, which was blocked by U0126 in human lung
cancer cells (25). In this study, we extended our study to show that
MKP-1 is induced by cisplatin, which requires ERK2 because such
a change was abrogated by U0126 (Fig. 4A). Importantly, we
have shown that down-regulation of ERK2 results in a decrease in
MKP-1 phosphorylation and induction (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that the ERK-dependent pathway is critical for cisplatininduced MKP-1 expression.
The regulation of MKP-1 is poorly understood, but it is believed
to involve both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (7, 12). Although transcriptional regulation of MKP-1 is
important for its expression and functions under certain conditions, several lines of evidence implicated that controlling MKP-1
protein degradation is critical for regulating its phosphatase
activity. It has been shown that the proteasome inhibitors Z-LLFCHO and lactacystin could increase the levels of MKP-1 protein
(34), suggesting that inhibition of the proteasome degradation
pathway enhances MKP-1 activity. Consistently, in human lung
cancer cell CL3, the carcinogenic metal Pb(II) induced MKP-1
polyubiquitination (35). It is believed that the mechanism
underlying this process involves the activation of ERK by Pb(II),
which triggers MKP-1 ubiquitination, resulting in its degradation
via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (35). This is consistent with
an earlier study showing that ERK-mediated degradation is crucial
for controlling MKP-1 levels (29). It is known that the majority of
proteins, once phosphorylated, are resistant to ubiquitin-mediated
degradation. A previous study showed that mitogen-induced ERK is
able to phosphorylate MKP-1 at Ser359 and Ser364, resulting in the
stabilization of the MKP-1 protein (29). Consistent with the role of
ERK in MKP-1 phosphorylation, we have shown that cisplatin can
activate ERK and in turn phosphorylate MKP-1 at Ser359 (Fig. 5A).
We believed that cisplatin-induced MKP-1 phosphorylation is
mediated by ERK because knockdown of ERK2 by siRNA
interference abolished MKP-1 phosphorylation and decreased the
total levels of MKP-1 protein (Fig. 5A). Thus, MKP-1 induction by
cisplatin is through an ERK-dependent mechanism.

It has been known that ERK can interact with p38 and JNK but
the mechanisms by which they interact remain unclear. We have
shown that ERK is required for MKP-1 activation because
knockdown of ERK2 abolished MKP-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A).
Kinetically, it seems that activation of ERK occurs earlier than that
of MKP-1, p38, and JNK in response to cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3A),
which suggests that ERK may be upstream of MKP-1, p38, and JNK.
It is documented that MKP-1 is capable of dephosphorylation of
ERK, p38, and JNK, thus inactivating all three MAPK signaling
pathways (7). Based on our data, it is possible that MKP-1 is a
mediator that links ERK to p38 and JNK, which is under investigation. In addition, we believe that, although ERK2 can phosphorylate MKP-1 to positively regulate MKP-1 activity, MKP-1–mediated
ERK inactivation keeps ERK in check, which provides a negative
feedback loop for tightly controlling ERK signaling.
Several lines of evidence implicated that the activation of ERK
signaling protects cancer cells from chemotherapy (36, 37). It has
been shown that cisplatin treatment activates ERK in ovarian
cancer cells and that activation of ERK protects ovarian cancer
cells from cisplatin-induced death (36, 37). Furthermore, inhibition
of ERK signaling by the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 blocked ERK
activation and increased cisplatin sensitivity in SKOV3 cells (37).
Consistent with the role of activation of ERK in modulating
cisplatin sensitivity, we have shown that ERK is activated by
cisplatin in the ovarian cancer cell OV433 and that inhibition of
ERK activation by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or knockdown of
ERK2 expression by siRNA interference sensitizes ovarian cancer
cells to cisplatin (Figs. 4B and 5B). These data suggest that ERK
signaling is a survival pathway that protects cells from cisplatininduced death. Importantly, we found that knockdown of ERK2
results in a decrease in MKP-1 expression induced by cisplatin
(Fig. 5A). Interestingly, knockdown of either ERK2 or MKP-1
enhanced cisplatin sensitivity (Fig. 5B), indicating that ERKmediated cisplatin resistance is through MKP-1. Although the role
of ERK in cisplatin resistance is implicated, the underlying
mechanism is not clear. Thus, demonstrating the role of MKP-1
as a mediator in ERK-mediated cisplatin resistance provides a

The antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-2,
play an important role in chemoresistance (38). It has been known
that MKP-1 is involved in cisplatin resistance (23, 25). However, it is
not clear whether there is a functional interaction between Bcl-2
and MKP-1. In this study, we have shown that knockdown of MKP1 or ERK2 decreases the basal levels of Bcl-2 protein, suggesting
that down-regulation of the Bcl-2 protein level lowers the cell death
threshold, thereby enhancing cisplatin-induced cell death. Furthermore, we have shown that inhibition of Bcl-2 activity by its
inhibitor Gossypol enhances cisplatin-induced cell death. We
believe that Bcl-2 is involved in ERK2-MKP-1 signaling, which
protects cells from cisplatin-induced cell death. Thus, another
novel finding of this study is to demonstrate the involvement of
Bcl-2 in ERK-MKP-1–mediated cisplatin resistance.
In conclusion, we showed that MKP-1 is induced by cisplatin
through phosphorylation by the ERK pathway. We also showed that
knockdown of ERK2 decreases MKP-1 induction. Because MKP-1 is
an important regulator of p38 and JNK, our study suggests that
MKP-1 may be a mediator that functionally links ERK to p38 and
JNK pathways. Furthermore, we showed that knockdown of either
ERK2 or MKP-1 enhances cisplatin sensitivity, suggesting that the
ERK-MKP-1 pathway is critical for cisplatin resistance. Importantly,
we showed that knockdown of either ERK2 or MKP-1 decreases
Bcl-2 expression, which suggests that Bcl-2 is involved in ERKMKP-1–mediated cisplatin resistance. Thus, our results suggest
that targeting ERK-MKP-1 signaling may overcome cisplatin
resistance in ovarian cancers.
