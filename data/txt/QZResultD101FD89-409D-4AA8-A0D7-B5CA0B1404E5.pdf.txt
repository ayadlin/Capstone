ABSTRACT
The lack of information concerning individual variation in drug-metabolizing
enzymes is one of the most important obstacles for designing personalized medicine
approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. To assess cytochrome P450
(CYP) in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous molecules in an HCC setting,
the activity changes of 10 major CYPs in microsomes from 105 normal and 102 HCC
liver tissue samples were investigated. We found that CYP activity values expressed
as intrinsic clearance (CLint) differed between HCC patients and control subjects. HCC
patient samples showed increased CLint for CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 compared
to controls. Meanwhile, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 CLint values decreased and
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 activity was unchanged relative to controls. For
patients with HCC accompanied by fibrosis or cirrhosis, the same activity changes
were seen for the CYP isoforms, except for CYP2D6 which had higher values in HCC
patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, CYP2D6*10 (100C>T), CYP2C9*3 (42614 A>C),
and CYP3A5*3 (6986A>G) polymorphisms had definite effects on enzyme activities.
In the HCC group, the CLint of CYP2D6*10 mutant homozygote was decreased by 95%
compared to wild-type samples, and the frequency of this homozygote was 2.8-fold
lower than the controls.
In conclusion, the activities of CYP isoforms were differentially affected in HCC
patients. Genetic polymorphisms of some CYP enzymes, especially CYP2D6*10,
could affect enzyme activity. CYP2D6*10 allelic frequency was significantly different
between HCC patients and control subjects. These findings may be useful for
personalizing the clinical treatment of HCC patients as well as predicting the risk of
hepatocarcinogenesis.

an increase in procarcinogen activation have also been
documented as HCC risk factors as well as changes in
the metabolism of environmental toxins that arise from
alterations in CYP activity [4–7].
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a large group of
enzymes that localize to mitochondrial membranes or
the endoplasmic reticulum and play crucial roles in the
metabolism of endogenous and exogenous molecules,
including most drugs [8]. CYP1, 2, and 3 families
are responsible for the metabolism of the majority of
drugs and other xenobiotics [9]. The most significant

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most
common form of liver cancer and a leading cause of
cancer death worldwide [1, 2]. HCC is often accompanied
by severe liver dysfunction that is closely related to
disease progression, which can influence HCC treatment
decisions. HCC pathogenesis involves multiple factors
[3] and is often promoted by chronic infection with the
hepatitis virus, especially hepatitis B and C virus (HBV
and HCV) [2]. A decrease in carcinogen metabolism and

drug metabolizing CYPs in humans include CYP1A2,
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19,
CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4/5, which are responsible
for the metabolism of approximately 90% of drugs used
clinically and/or metabolic activation of procarcinogens
[9–11]. CYP enzymes are key enzymes involved in cancer
development [12]. They mediate the metabolic activation
of numerous procarcinogens [12]. Therefore, assessment
of changes in CYP enzyme activity would be useful not
only for designing personalized HCC treatments, but also
for identifying potential factors that contribute to HCC
susceptibility. Due to numerous physiological disorders
that can accompany HCC, treatment of this cancer type
and its complications often requires adjustment of drug
dosages. However, using changes in CYP enzyme activity
in HCC patients as the basis of dosage adjustment has not
been described to date.
Yan et al. investigated the activity of seven CYPs
in tumors obtained from 26 patients with HCC [13]. The
results showed that activity of these seven CYP isoforms
was decreased in tumor human liver microsomes (HLMs)
relative to those in pericarcinomatous HLMs and control
HLMs. The pericarcinomatous tissues were confirmed to
be cirrhosis, however the disease history of the donors of
the control pooled HLMs was not clear. Another similar
study characterized CYP3A4 activity in tumor tissue from
18 HCC patients [14]. The liver microsomes from adjacent
non-cancerous tissue and pooled male liver microsomes
were used as controls. In these two reports the individual
variation of CYP activity in normal liver tissue was not
described.
Early in vitro studies have indicated that CYPs
activity is selectively altered in liver undergoing cirrhosis
[15–18]. In addition, some in vivo studies have reported
that CYP isoform activity is differentially affected by the
presence of liver disease [19–21]. However, these studies
focused on simple cirrhosis without accompanying HCC
and therefore the results may be inappropriate for use
in designing personalized approaches for treating HCC
patients.
Since all CYPs that metabolize drugs are
polymorphic, numerous studies have focused on the
relationship between the distribution of mutant CYP
alleles and risk of developing different types of cancer.
DNA mutations are known to be important carcinogenic
factors in many tumor-related diseases [22]. However,
a consistent consensus does not as yet exist regarding
causation. Some in vivo studies suggest that CYP
polymorphisms maybe related to HCC, while others found
that CYP mutations had no effect [12, 23–27]. Due to
these contradictory conclusions, exploring the relationship
between CYP polymorphisms and drug-metabolizing
changes in liver cancer patients is important for providing
personalized treatment options.
The present study systematically assessed changes
in ten major CYP enzymes in HLMs from HCC patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

compared to normal liver tissue. The effect of HCC
together with liver disease (i.e., cirrhosis and fibrosis) and
CYP single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was also
evaluated. Twenty-four CYP SNPs with frequencies of
more than 1% in Chinese people were investigated. These
mutant sites could represent the main SNPs that affect
metabolic enzyme activities. We believe that our data
show inter-individual differences in CYP metabolism,
which can be used for a personalized treatment approach
of HCC.

RESULTS
Clinical characteristics of patients
Clinical, laboratory, and demographic data were
collected from 102 HCC patients and 105 control subjects
(Table 1). In both groups, over half the subjects were
between 45 and 59 years old. There were 54 patients
with liver fibrosis (including S1, S2, and S3) and 48
patients with liver cirrhosis (S4) among the HCC patients.
Compared with controls, there were more males, smokers,
and drinkers in the HCC group (P < 0.01). The age of
the HCC subjects was slightly older than the controls
(P < 0.05). All subjects only received regular anesthetics
and had no history of exposure to known CYP-inducing
or -inhibiting agents.

Enzyme activity in HLMs
The median individual metabolic parameters (Km,
Vmax, CLint) of liver microsomes from both HCC groups
and controls were determined (Figure 1). Compared
with controls, the Km values for CYP1A2, CYP2A6,
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4/5
were higher in HCC patients. Meanwhile, CYP2C9 and
CYP2D6 values did not differ between HCC patients and
control subjects. CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6,
CYP2E1, and CYP3A4/5 had higher Vmax values in HCC
patients, while the Vmax values of CYP1A2 and CYP2C8
were significantly reduced relative to control samples. The
Vmax of CYP2C19 showed no difference between HCC
patients and control subjects. The most notable difference
between the two groups was the Vmax of CYP2E1, which
was increased by 2.3-fold in HCC patients relative to
controls (1238.0 vs. 539.3 pmol/min/mg, respectively;
P < 0.01). The CLint values for CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and
CYP2E1 were increased in HCC patients, while CYP1A2,
CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 values were lower in HCC
patients than in controls. The CLint values for CYP2A6,
CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 were unchanged between the
two groups. The most prominent change was the CLint
of CYP2C8, which in HCC patients was 77% that of the
value for the controls (0.63 vs. 2.7μl/min/mg, respectively;
P < 0.01).

was increased by 53.6% in patients with cirrhosis relative
to those with fibrosis (8.4 vs. 3.9 μM, respectively; P <

Compared with controls, the Km values of CYP1A2,
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and

CYP2C19 were decreased, while CYP2C9 and CYP2E1
values were increased. In addition, the CLint values of
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 were unchanged
relative to controls. Interestingly, the change in CYP2D6
activity between the cirrhosis and fibrosis groups was not
consistent. The presence of cirrhosis significantly affected

Effect of fibrosis and cirrhosis on enzyme
activity
In order to further evaluate the effect of disease
progression on CYP activities, HCC patients were
categorized into two subgroups that included patients with
fibrosis or cirrhosis.
As shown in Figure 2, the Km values of most CYP
isoforms did not differ between the fibrosis and cirrhosis
subgroups with the exception of CYP2D6 and CYP2C8.
The Km of CYP2C8 was higher (25.7 vs. 21.4 μM; P
< 0.05), but the value of CYP2D6 was lower (21.4 vs.
41.9 μM; P < 0.01) in the cirrhosis group relative to the
fibrosis group, respectively. In terms of Vmax, the CYP
isoform activities were not different between the fibrosis
and cirrhosis groups. The presence of fibrosis or cirrhosis

(21.4 vs. 28.9μM, respectively; P < 0.05) and an increase
in the CLint value (8.4 vs. 3.5 μl/min/mg, respectively;
P < 0.01) relative to controls. However, the Km and
CLint values of CYP2D6 in the fibrosis group did not
significantly differ from the control subjects (Figure 2).
Taken together, these results indicate that the effect
of disease progression on CYP enzyme activities were not

significantly different in HCC patients with fibrosis and
cirrhosis, with the exception of CYP2D6.

Allele and genotype frequency distribution
The allelic frequency of CYP2D6*10 (100C>T)
significantly differed between the control and HCC groups
(Table 2). Moreover, the CYP2D6*10 mutant homozygote

T/T frequency was lower (16.7% vs. 46.7%; P < 0.01) and
the heterozygote C/T frequency was significantly higher
(46.9% vs. 21.9%; P < 0.01) in HCC groups relative
to control subjects, respectively. Among control group
subjects, the highest genotype frequency was CYP2D6*10
T/T, which had the lowest frequency in the HCC group.

The allelic frequency of the CYP2D6*10 mutation
was significantly reduced in HCC patients with fibrosis or
cirrhosis relative to controls. The mutant homozygote T/T
frequency was also lower in both in fibrosis and cirrhosis
groups than control subjects. In contrast, the frequency of
C/T was increased in both the fibrosis and cirrhosis groups
compared to control subjects.

In addition, the frequency of mutant homozygote T/T
was significantly reduced in the cirrhosis group relative
to the fibrosis group (8.9% vs. 23.5%, respectively; P <
0.01).
The allelic frequencies of CYP2C9*3 and CYP3A5*3
were not different in HCC patients (Supplementary
Table S3).

In the control group, similar result was observed.
CYP2D6*10, CYP3A5*3 and CYP2C9*3 mutations had
clear effects on enzyme activities.

Effect of demographic factors and clinical data
on CYP activity
The influence of sex, tobacco smoking, and alcohol
consumption were also analyzed and the result was shown
in Figure 4.
Using CLint values as a measure of CYP activity, we
found that females with HCC had higher CYP2A6 CLint
values than male HCC patients (164.1 vs. 142.1 μl/min/
mg, respectively; P < 0.05). The CLint for CYP2D6 was
higher for HCC patients who were non-smokers than
for HCC patients who smoked (9.0 vs. 5.3 μl/min/mg,
respectively; P < 0.05). Similarly, the CLint of CYP2D6
for HCC patients who did not drink was higher than
for HCC patients who did drink (8.5 vs. 5.0 μl/min/mg,
respectively; P < 0.05).
In control subjects, there were no statistically
significant differences (P > 0.05) in the CLint of 10 CYPs
as a function of gender, smoking status, or drinking habit
with the exception of CYP2D6. History of smoking was
associated with significant differences in the CLint value
of CYP2D6 compared to controls (3.0 vs. 5.7μl/min/mg,
respectively; P < 0.05).

Effect of CYP genetic polymorphisms on enzyme
activity
Twenty-four DNA polymorphisms were analyzed
in HCC patients and controls. The polymorphisms
that influenced enzyme activity are shown in Figure 3.
In the HCC group, the Km of the CYP2D6*10 mutant
homozygote T/T (125.1 μM) was significantly higher than
that for the heterozygote C/T (30.4 μM) and wild-type
C/C (17.4 μM). The pattern for Vmax values differed from
that for Km values, with C/C (241.5 pmol/min/mg) being
the highest and T/T (89.4 pmol/min/mg) being the lowest,
while C/T (155.6 pmol/min/mg) had intermediate activity.
The CLint of T/T (0.70 μl/min/mg) was remarkably lower
than that for C/T (6.9 μl/min/mg) or C/C (13.2 μl/min/mg).
The most significant change in CLint was for T/T, which
was decreased by 95% compared with C/C.
The Km of CYP3A5*3 mutant homozygote *3/*3
(2.3 μM) was significantly lower than in the wildtype *1/*1 (3.9 μM) and mutant heterozygote *1/*3
(2.8μM). The Vmax showed the same differences as Km
(*3/*3<*1/*3<*1/*1, 994.8 vs. 1402.5 vs. 2975.5 pmol/
min/mg, respectively). Similarly, the CLint of *3/*3 (490.8
μl/min/mg) and *1/*3 (542.0 μl/min/mg) both were
significantly lower than *1/*1 (762.9 μl/min/mg).
The CYP2C9*3 mutant homozygote *3/*3 was
not detected in HCC patients. The Vmax of the mutant
heterozygote *1/*3 was significantly lower than that
for wild-type *1/*1 (223.2 vs. 326.5 pmol/min/mg,
respectively; P < 0.01). Meanwhile, the CLint of *1/*3 (1.1
pmol/min/mg) was significantly lower than for*1/*1 (1.6
pmol/min/mg, P < 0.05).
In addition, the CLint and Vmax values of CYP2B6
(516G>T) mutant homozygote T/T were lower than those of
wild-type G/G. No significant influence on enzyme activity
was identified for the other CYP polymorphisms assessed.

DISCUSSION
In this study we found varying activities of 10 CYP
isoforms in HLMs isolated from HCC patients compared
to normal control HLMs, which were obtained from
patients with hemangioma or other liver diseases and
confirmed by histopathological examination and a liver
function test. In HCC patients, CLint values increased for
CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1, while the values for
CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 decreased. In addition,
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 activities were
unchanged between HCC patients and control subjects.
Diseases that often accompany HCC, such as fibrosis and
cirrhosis, did not affect CYP activity changes, except for
CYP2D6 which had higher CLint values in the presence of
50617

cirrhosis. Moreover, gene polymorphisms and genotype
frequency of some CYP isoforms, especially CYP2D6*10,
clearly affected CYP activity in HCC patients.
Given the important role of CYP isoforms in drug
metabolism, these HCC-related changes in CYP activity
could influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs used
to treat this cancer. Several previous studies reported
that the activities of several CYPs, including CYP1A2,
CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A
were decreased in cirrhosis patients relative to healthy
subjects [15, 16, 19-21, 31-35]. However, in the current
study we found that the CYP2D6 CLint value from the
cirrhosis patient subgroup was significantly higher than
that for HCC patients without cirrhosis. This inconsistency
could in part be due to the fact that these earlier studies

focused on patients with simple cirrhosis who did not have
accompanying HCC. Meanwhile, another study found
that CYP2A6 activity decreased in patients with either
moderate or severe alcoholic liver disease, but not in those
with only mild forms of the disease [31]. In contrast, our
study showed that CYP2A6 activity was not changed in
the fibrosis or cirrhosis subgroups of HCC patients, which
again demonstrates the differences that may exist between
simple cirrhosis and cirrhosis that accompanies HCC. The
different characteristics identified in our study suggest
that a special reference standard would be essential for
personalizing treatments for HCC patients with cirrhosis.
Some exogenous substances can be metabolized
by CYP into carcinogenic molecules. For example,
nitrosamine is a common procarcinogen that is

metabolized by CYP2E1 into acetaldehyde, which can
induce multiple cancer types. Our data showed that
CYP2E1 activity was higher in HCC patients. However,
a previous study found that CYP2E1 activity was lower
in patients with moderate or severe cirrhosis [17]. The
differences may again be due to the different inclusion
criteria. Our study considered patients with cirrhosis or
fibrosis that accompanied HCC, while the other study
examined only those patients with simple cirrhosis [17].
Therefore, additional studies are needed to confirm

whether changes in CYP2E1 activity are critical factors
in the progression of cirrhosis to HCC. However, the
increased levels of pre-carcinogen activation might
explain in part why CYP2E1 activities were higher in
HCC patients than in simple cirrhosis patients. The results
also indicate that CYP activity might be a risk factor for
HCC and a candidate marker for metabolic susceptibility
to HCC.
Although numerous studies have reported that DNA
sequence mutations are associated with HCC susceptibility

[23-27, 36, 37], in this study we found that only the allelic
frequency distributions of CYP2D6*10 significantly
differed between the control and HCC groups. Moreover,
in both the control and the HCC group, the CYP2D6*10
T/T type carriers had lower CLint than C/C or C/T carriers.
Relative to control subjects, the T/T frequency was lower
in HCC patients, especially in the cirrhosis subgroup.
This result is consistent with reports by Silvestri et al.
and Agúndez et al. [24, 25]. The higher CYP2D6 activity
in HCC patients compared to control subjects may be
attributed to them carrying more functional alleles. In
addition, subjects who carried the CYP2D6*10 mutant
homozygote appeared to have a lower risk of developing
HCC.
In order to further verify the influence of these
factors on CYP activity in HCC patients, we investigated
the effect of demographics data on CYP activities. CYP
activity values are expressed as intrinsic clearance (CLint),
we did not observe an obvious effect of gender, smoking,
or drinking on most CYP activities, with the exception
of CYP2D6 and CYP2A6. The CLint for CYP2D6 was
lower in HCC patients who were smokers and drinkers
compared to those who were non-smokers and nondrinkers. In this study there were more smokers and
drinkers in the HCC group than in the control group and
CYP2D6 CLint was higher in HCC patients than in control
subjects. Therefore, smoking may not be related to the
activity changes observed in HCC patients, or at least not
the main influencing factor. In addition, males had a lower
CLint value of CYP2A6 than females in the HCC group.
However, there were more males in the HCC patient
group compared to the control group and the CYP2A6
CLint value did not differ between these two groups.
Therefore, gender may not have a substantial impact on
CYP activity. Previous studies demonstrated that smoking
is clinically induction of liver microsomal CYP1A2
[35]. Alcohol consumption is known to cause induction
of liver microsomal CYP2E1 [38]. In the present study,
it was not observed the effect of tobacco smoking and
alcohol consumption on CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 activities.
This disparity may due to other factor, including ethnic,
regional, disease, and sample number.
In conclusion, the 10 tested CYP isoforms exhibited
different changes in activity in HCC patients as evidenced
by increased, decreased, and constant CLint values
relative to control subjects. In addition, accompanying
symptoms of fibrosis and cirrhosis affected CYP activities
differently in HCC patients. These results indicate that
some therapeutic regimens, including drugs metabolized
by CYP isoforms, may require adjustments in HCC
patients. Our observations in this study may be helpful
for designing personalized treatments for HCC patients.
In addition, CYP2D6*10 had unique gene polymorphisms
and genotype frequency, and the mutation clearly affected
enzyme activity in HCC patients. Moreover, the activity
of CYP2E1, which is the major enzyme that metabolizes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ethanol and nitrosamine, was significantly increased in
HCC patients compared to that in the control subjects.
These data could also be helpful for understanding disease
mechanisms in HCC patients. Our findings suggest that the
polymorphism of CYP2D6*10 may be a good predictor of
hepatocarcinogenesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical Statement
Approvals for tissue collection and in vitro
xenobiotic metabolism studies were obtained from the
Medical Ethics Committee of Zhengzhou University.
Informed written consent was obtained from the patients
for the collection of liver specimens.

Human Liver Samples
All non-tumor liver tissues were obtained from
members of the Chinese Han population who underwent
surgical resection in the Henan Provincal People’s
Hospital, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou
University, and Henan Provincal Tumor Hospital between
March 2012 and July 2014. All patients received a liver
function test, histopathological analysis, and imaging
(ultrasonography or computer tomography). All liver
samples from patients with tumors were 2 cm distant from
the tumor tissue and were stored in liquid nitrogen within
30 min of resection until use.
HBV- or HCV-infected liver tissues (102 samples)
were all from patients with HCC. Liver samples
were categorized as having fibrosis or cirrhosis by
histopathological examination. Liver tissue samples
(105 samples) were collected from subjects with liver
hemangioma, metastatic carcinoma, cholelithiasis, or
gallbladder cancer. These subjects had normal liver
function and negative serum HBV and HCV markers,
and the liver samples were confirmed to be normal by
histopathological examination. These samples were used
as normal liver controls.
Detailed information for each patient was welldocumented and included gender, age, body height, body
weight, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, clinical
diagnosis, regular drug intake before surgery, previous
history, allergic history, pathological diagnosis, imaging
examination, and laboratory test data (including, but
not limited to, results from routine blood analysis, liver
function tests, and renal function tests). We defined
‘drinkers’ as those who have drunk 2-3 times or more
drinking per week, ‘non-drinkers’ as individuals who had
never drunk, or those who had drunk less than 2 times
per week. We defined ‘smokers’ as those who smoke 11
cigarettes or more smoking per day, ‘non-smokers’ as
individuals who had never smoked or smoke less than

11 cigarettes per day. The standard referred the previous
method [28].

5’-hydroxyomeprazole, 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone, and
1’-hydroxymidazolam, were separation by HPLC-UV. The
7’-hydroxycoumarin and O-demethylation dextrorphan
were separation by HPLC-FLD. A detailed description
of the separation methods used for the 10 CYP activity
assays is provided in Supplementary Table S2.

Preparation of liver microsomes
Human liver microsomes (HLMs) were prepared
according to the hypothermal differential centrifugation
method as previously described [29]. Microsomal protein
concentration was determined according to the Bradford
method [30].

Genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from human liver
tissues using a genomic DNA purification kit (QIAGEN
Translational Medicine Co., Ltd, China). Polymorphisms
in 10 CYP isoforms with frequencies of more than 1% in
the Chinese sample set were investigated. A total of 23
allelic mutations were determined by mass spectrometry
performed by the LIUHE HUADA Genomics Technology
Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). And the allele CYP2E1*1C/*1D
were genotyped using one-step PCR.

Enzyme activities in HLMs
All probe drugs and part metabolites used in
the current study were purchased from the National
Institute for the Food and Drug Control (China),
including phenacetin, acetaminophen, coumarin,
bupropion, paclitaxel, tolbutamide, omeprazole,
dextromethorphan, chlorzoxazone, and midazolam. Other
metabolites (7’-hydroxycoumarin, hydroxybupropion,
6-hydroxypaclitaxel,
4’-hydroxytolbutamide,
5’-hydroxyomeprazole, O-demethylation dextrorphan,
6-hydroxychlorzoxazone, and 1’-hydroxymidazolam)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) was obtained from Roche Co.,
Ltd. (Switzerland). All organic solvents were of high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purity and
obtained from Siyou Chemical Reagent Co. (Tianjin,
China).
The activity of the 10 most important CYP
isoforms, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6,
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and
3A4/5, were measured using HLMs and probe substrates.
Phenacetin O-deethylation, coumarin 7-hydroxylation,
bupropion 4-hydroxylation, paclitaxel 6-hydroxylation,
tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation, omeprazole 5-hydroxylation,
dextromethorphan O-demethylation, chlorzoxazone
6-hydroxylation, and midazolam 1-hydroxylation were
used as activity indicators of CYP1A2, CYP2A6,
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6,
CYP2E1, and CYP3A/5, respectively.
For biotransformation, seven or eight substrate
concentrations were examined. Incubation mixtures
contained HLMs, 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4),
and different concentrations of substrate with 1 mM
NADPH. The mixture was pre-incubated for 5 min at
37°C. Reactions were terminated by adding 20μl ice-cold
acetonitrile, 1 ml ethylacetate, or 10 μl perchloric acid.
The detailed description of incubation conditions for the
10 CYP activity assays is provided in Supplementary
Table S1.
The formation of all substrate metabolites was
determined by HPLC. Several substrate metabolites,
including
acetaminophen,
hydroxybupropion,
6-hydroxypaclitaxel,
4’-hydroxytolbutamide,

Statistical analysis
Since most data sets were not normally distributed,
nonparametric methods were generally used for
statistical analyses. The Michaelis-Menten constant
(Km) and maximum reaction velocity (Vmax) values were
determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0. In vitro intrinsic
clearance (CLint) was calculated from the ratio of Vmax to
Km. SPSS statistics17.0 software was used for statistical
analyses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for pairwise
comparisons. P values<0.05 were considered statistically
significant (two-tailed). All graphs were generated using
the Adobe Photoshop CC 2014, PowerPoint 2016 and
GraphPad Prism version 5.0 software package.
