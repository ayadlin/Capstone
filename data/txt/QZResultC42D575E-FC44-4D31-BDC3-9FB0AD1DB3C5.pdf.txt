Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although hereditary predisposition to cancer was known before 1900, it was only then, after
the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's once-ignored 19th century work, that hereditary
predisposition to cancer could be rationalized. By then it was also known that the pattern of
chromosomes in cancer cells is abnormal. The next contribution to understanding cancer
genetics was made by Theodor Boveri, who proposed that some chromosomes might
stimulate cell division and others might inhibit it, but his idea was long overlooked. Now we
know that there are genes of both types.
In this review, we summarize the history of the study of the latter type of genes, tumour
suppressor genes (TSGs), and the evidence supporting a role for both complete and partial
tumour suppressor inactivation in the pathogenesis of cancer. We integrate the classical
“two-hit” hypothesis of tumour suppression with a continuum model that accounts for subtle
dosage effects of tumour suppressors, and we discuss other exceptions to the two-hit
hypothesis such as the emerging concept of “obligate haploinsufficiency” in which partial
loss of a TSG is more tumourigenic than complete loss. The continuum model highlights the
importance of subtle regulation of TSG expression or activity such as regulation by
miRNAs. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model on the diagnosis and therapy of
cancer.

The “two-hit” hypothesis
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The first evidence for a genetic abnormality as a cause of cancer came with the discovery, in
1960, of the abnormal “Philadelphia” chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukaemia
cells1. Later, in 1973, it was discovered that this chromosome was a translocation between
chromosomes 9 and 222 and in 1977, a translocation of chromosomes 15 and 17 was
identified in acute promyelocytic leukaemia4. Eventually, the genes at the breakpoints of
these translocations were cloned - BCR/ABL in 19833 and PML/RARα in 19915.
Meanwhile, seminal work demonstrated that the cancer-causing gene within the avian
sarcoma virus genome, v-src, was actually a co-opted and mutated version of a normal
cellular gene termed a proto-oncogene, now called c-src6,7. These observation demonstrated
that normal cellular genes, when mutated or altered, are able to cause cancer, and were
followed by the identification of numerous other cellular oncogenes that are activated by
mutation, chromosome translocation, or amplification. One of Boveri's predictions was
proven to be correct.

In the 1980s, scientists verified Boveri's other prediction with the identification of a second
class of genes involved in cancer, “tumour suppressor genes,” that inhibit cancer
development and oppose oncogene function. In a normal cell, a physiological balance
between tumour suppressors and oncogenes maintains homeostasis and allows carefully
regulated cell proliferation without unrestrained malignant tumour growth. Somatic cell
fusion experiments pointed to the existence of such TSGs, because fusion of a normal cell
with a malignant cell could revert the malignant cell to a normal phenotype8. One paradox
that puzzled cancer researchers was that cancer susceptibility syndromes usually display a
dominant mode of inheritance whereas the hypothesized “tumour suppressor genes”
appeared to function in a recessive manner in the in vitro cell fusion experiments.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The resolution of this problem was provided by the analysis of a tumour of children,
retinoblastoma (RB), which is sometimes present even at birth9. Statistical modelling
indicated that hereditary cases likely developed after only one somatic mutational event. It
was hypothesized that that one mutant allele is inherited and the other is generated
somatically during growth of the developing eye. Because of the high chance of the second
“hit” occurring, almost all individuals with the inherited first hit (the mutant allele) will
develop retinoblastoma, and therefore the cancer susceptibility phenotype is inherited in a
dominant manner (Figure 1). In contrast, tumour initiation requires both hits, and therefore
tumourigenesis is recessive. A similar mechanism could be extended to sporadic
retinoblastoma, the only difference being that in the sporadic cases both the first and second
hits occur in somatic tissue. At the time of the original analysis, it wasn't known if these two
hits occurred in the same or distinct genes, but it was clear that the search for the secondary
mutation would start with the disease gene itself.
The success of the two-hit model came with the identification of deletion of a locus on
chromosome 13 in RB tumours and the subsequent cloning of the RB1 gene as mutated in
familial retinoblastoma10–17. This discovery was made possible by the development of
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping technology. Using this
approach, it was shown that many families with familial retinoblastoma did indeed harbour
mutations or deletions of RB1 in the germline (the first hit), and tumours from RB patients
nearly always contained mutation or loss of the other RB1 allele10–17 (the second hit). This
latter event most often results from somatic mitotic recombination, while in a minority of
cases, the normal allele acquires a distinct mutation. The role of recessive TSGs in
dominantly inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes could then be understood, and Boveri's
second prediction was substantiated.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

These findings and others established the two-hit hypothesis as a model that not only
explained hereditary cancer susceptibility but also provided a proof-of-principle that TSGs
could be identified by the study of chromosomal deletions and genetic linkage in hereditary
cases of a cancer and subsequent analysis of the second allele of the locus. Such a strategy
was critical to the ultimate identification of TP53 (commonly called p53) as a TSG18 and
was used successfully in the identification of other TSGs such as APC19, BRCA120, and
BRCA221. Now the advent of high-throughput sequencing and genome-wide copy number
profiling is allowing further systematic identification of regions of mutation and deletion in
tumour genomes22,23.
It should be noted that it was initially hypothesized that two hits would be sufficient for the
initiation of some tumours such as paediatric cancers, but additional mutations would be
necessary for others. It is now thought that non-hereditary cancers require at approximately
four or more distinct mutation events that result in perturbation of critical cellular signalling
pathways such as PI3K, p53, or RB24. Malignancy is thought to result from an iterative
process of somatic mutation followed by clonal expansion25. In the context of hereditary

cancer syndromes, full inactivation of the involved disease gene may be the rate-limiting
step for tumour initiation, but other events may occur, particularly to promote or enhance
tumour progression. In this respect, the “two-hit hypothesis” should be applied directly to
the TSG, with two hits representing the number of events necessary for inactivation of the
TSG, but not necessarily for tumourigenesis. Haploinsufficiency, as we discuss below, must
also be interpreted in this context; in many cases, a gene might be haploinsufficient for a
specific cellular function, but TSG haploinsufficiency may promote tumour formation only
in the context of other genetic or environmental insults.

Haploinsufficiency and quasi-sufficiency
The two-hit hypothesis clearly explained the differences in tumour number and age of onset
of RB in hereditary vs. sporadic cases of RB. Moreover, it led to the eventual cloning of
RB1 as the first bona fide human TSG. The hypothesis has been useful in cloning genes for
hereditary cancers and for their non-hereditary counterparts. However, this success has led
to a questionable dogma in the field that all important tumour suppressors should behave
according to the “two-hit” model.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Investigators sought to apply the principles learned from the two-hit model to sporadic
cancers in order to identify novel TSGs. Many recurring regions of chromosomal deletion
have been identified in sporadic cancers, suggestive of the presence of a TSG.
Unfortunately, it has become apparent that not all regions of consistent loss are accompanied
by obvious aberrations on the other allele, raising the question of whether these deletions
may represent “passenger” events not relevant to carcinogenesis. Indeed, very few of the
identified regions of chromosomal losses have yielded clear TSGs in those loci that conform
to the two-hit hypothesis. This finding has led many to conclude that the relevant tumour
suppressors in those regions have not been identified or do not exist, when in fact many
genes in those loci are known to have tumour suppressive properties in vitro or in vivo.
Alternatively, these regions could harbour bona fide TSGs but may represent regions/genes
where single copy mutation or loss plays a role in tumourigenesis. These single copy events
may be even be selected for during tumourigenesis instead of biallelic TSG loss. One
possibility is that the initial lesion, when reduced to homozygosity, may lead to cell death or
senescence. The lethality could be due to homozygosity of the disease gene itself or of other
distinct genes included in the initial “hit,” since recombination is a principal “second hit” in
tumourigenesis26. Such a scenario would result in an “obligate haploinsufficiency” in which
selection pressure during tumourigenesis favours partial, but not complete, loss of the TSG.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A second possibility is that the single copy mutation of a TSG functions as a dominantnegative towards the wild-type gene/protein. After mutation of one allele, the mutant protein
product interferes with the normal wild-type protein produced from the remaining wild-type
allele. Because the complete normal function of the TSG is already impaired with only one
hit, there is no selection pressure by the tumour for loss or mutation of the wild-type allele.
A third possibility is that a gene or genes in the region of consistent deletion exhibits
haploinsufficiency for tumour suppressor function and single-copy loss of the TSG is
sufficient for aberrant TSG function and promotion of cancer (Figure 1). In contrast with
classical TSGs that are insensitive to large reductions in expression or activity, the function
of haploinsufficient TSGs is impaired by a 50% partial reduction in expression or activity, or
sometimes by subtler changes, as in a “quasi-insufficiency” of TSG function that we discuss
below.
The role of haploinsufficiency in cancer has been met with scepticism, despite the wellestablished role of haploinsufficiency in numerous developmental disorders such as, for

instance, aniridia (caused by haploinsufficiency for PAX6) and Grieg syndrome (caused by
haploinsufficiency of GLI3)27. Just as increased dosage of genes can result in developmental
syndromes, such as Down syndrome, increased dosage or activity of oncogenes is an
established genetic mechanism of malignancy28, exemplified by the role of MYC
amplification or RAS hyperactivity in cancer. However, the notion that subtle decreases in
gene dosage or protein activity can be relevant to cancer has gained only limited acceptance
in the scientific community.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

One reason for this scepticism stems from the difficulty in definitively proving a
haploinsufficient TSG is involved in tumourigenesis. Whereas the rare TSGs that fully
conform to the two-hit hypothesis can be identified by their homozygous deletion or
mutation in cancer, haploinsufficient TSGs cannot be identified in such a manner. Moreover,
large regions of the genome, encompassing many genes, can be targeted by allelic loss and
likewise, many genes may acquire somatic mutations during the course of tumour
development. It is assumed that only a portion of these genes is responsible for the cancer,
while the rest are passenger mutations. What then could be the gold standard by which to
determine which gene or genes in the region are causative and which are non-involved
bystanders? Unlike the analysis of traditional TSGs, no one assay or approach offers
definitive proof that a haploinsufficient TSG is causally involved in tumourigenesis. Instead,
an integrated approach involving human genetic analysis, in vitro and ex vivo functional
studies, and murine cancer genetic modelling is critical to ascertain whether a gene may
function as a haploinsufficient gene in cancer. Although there are caveats of each analysis
on its own, a body of evidence from each of these analyses can strongly implicate a gene in
dosage-sensitive tumour suppression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Throughout this review, we use PTEN as a model dosage-sensitive TSG, but numerous other
TSGs exhibit haploinsufficiency and dosage-sensitivity. Notably, TP53, commonly referred
to as p53, exhibits haploinsufficiency. Mice with heterozygous (+/−) p53 mutation show an
intermediate survival to that of p53 homozygous mutants and wild-type mice, and tumours
that develop in the +/− animals do not always display loss of the remaining wild-type
allele29. Similarly, tumours in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a cancer susceptibility
syndrome caused by germline mutation of p53, do not always exhibit loss of the wild-type
p53 allele, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of p53 may be sufficient for tumour initiation
in humans as well30. A caveat with these analyses is that the effect of p53 haploinsufficiency
on cancer initiation in mouse models and Li-Fraumeni patients may be due to complex noncell autonomous effects stemming from the partial loss of p53 throughout the body.
However, ex vivo analysis of murine p53 heterozygous thymocytes showed that these cells
have an impaired apoptotic response to ionizing radiation or etoposide31. Similarly, a p53deleted HCT116 isogenic cell line expressed only 25% the normal level of p53 mRNA and
exhibited an impairment in induction of p53-responsive genes and apoptosis after exposure
to UV radiation32. These studies demonstrate that reductions in p53 dosage and function can
impact on a cells' ability to respond to oncogenic stimuli and strengthen the notion that p53
haploinsufficiency may drive tumourigenesis.
Similarly, other classic cancer susceptibility genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 may exhibit
haploinsufficiency and/or dosage effects. Primary breast and ovarian cells from patients with
heterozygous germline mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 have altered mRNA profiles
compared to BRCA wild-type cells, suggesting that single hits in these genes can confer
phenotypic differences that could in principle impact on breast and/or ovarian
tumourigenesis33. Indeed, ex vivo studies of human BRCA1 mutant breast cells have found
that these cells exhibit enhanced colony formation potential34 and show impaired lineage
commitment in differentiation assays35. Although tumour formation in BRCA1 and BRCA2
carriers does appear to require the “second hit,” these “one-hit” premalignant changes could

impact tumourigenesis by either promoting loss of the second TSG allele or of other TSGs,
or by altering the cellular phenotype to predispose to certain tumour subtypes.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Another haploinsufficient TSG is the transcription factor PAX5. PAX5 is found mutated,
deleted, or translocated in approximately 30% of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases, but
the aberrant mutations/deletions are almost invariably mono-allelic and appear to function as
hypomorphs, not dominant negative alleles36. Similarly, the E3 ligase FBW7 is mutated in
approximately 10% of human colorectal cancers37. In 70% of these cases, the mutations are
mono-allelic, suggestive of haploinsufficiency. Conditional mono-allelic deletion of Fbw7 in
the murine intestine cooperated with the tumourigenic APCmin allele in intestinal
tumourigenesis, albeit to a lesser degree than biallelic deletion of Fbw7, suggesting that
Fbw7 is dosage-sensitive37.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Like complete loss of TSGs, the effect of TSG haploinsufficiency can be highly tissuespecific and context dependent (Figure 2). Thus, the cellular and molecular context in which
TSG function is altered will determine the outcome of such impairment of TSG function.
The differing outcomes of TSG expression level in differing situations may reflect distinct
thresholds of protein expression or activity needed for certain processes or in differing cell
contexts. For example, in one cell type there may be other compensatory proteins that mask
the potential phenotype caused by TSG haploinsufficiency whereas in other cells these
proteins are not expressed and so the haploinsufficiency of the TSG manifests as tissuespecific cancer susceptibility.

Two hits for tumour suppression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The genetic background of the individual or tumour will also impact the phenotypic
outcome of TSG haploinsufficiency. In some cases, combinatorial effects could arise
whereby haploinsufficiency or mutation of other genetic loci is required for a phenotype
caused by TSG haploinsufficiency. A powerful example of this context dependency is
provided by the interaction between Pten deficiency or haploinsufficiency and the presence
or absence of mutated p5338 (Figure 2). In the context of wild-type p53, Pten
haploinsufficiency is actually more tumourigenic in the prostate than complete loss of Pten,
because the latter triggers a p53-dependent fail-safe senescence mechanism called Pten-loss
induced cellular senescence (PICS). Haploinsufficiency of Pten enhances proliferation
without activating PICS, making partial loss of Pten more detrimental in this context than
complete loss of Pten (Figure 2). Similarly, complete loss of PTEN in the blood induces
hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion or bone marrow failure, unless loss of PTEN is
accompanied by other genetic events39. After accumulation of aneuploidy or other
mutations, such as loss of p53, complete loss of PTEN in the blood induces fatal
leukemias39,40 (Figure 2).
This phenomenon defines a novel paradigm of “obligate haploinsufficiency” in which
selection pressure during tumour growth may favour haploinsufficiency of a TSG over
complete loss in certain scenarios (Figure 1). However, in advanced cancers with p53
mutation or loss, PICS cannot be induced and complete loss of Pten enhances proliferation
and tumourigenesis to a greater degree than Pten haploinsufficiency. This remarkable
finding likely explains why complete loss of PTEN is typically restricted to advanced
cancers and also emphasizes the importance of single-hit haploinsufficiency of TSGs in
cancer initiation. Understanding the combinatorial and contextual dependencies of genetic
events should not only enhance our ability to effectively treat tumours with differing
combinations on genetic “hits” but will also inform chemopreventative strategies for
eradicating cancer by attacking mechanisms necessary for its development.

Like PTEN, many other TSGs exhibit “obligate haploinsufficiency” where partial loss of the
TSG is tumourigenic but complete loss is lethal to the cell. One example is the microRNAprocessing enzyme DICER1. Mono-allelic deletion or mRNA downregulation of DICER1 is
observed in diverse cancers41,42. In murine models, mono-allelic conditional deletion of
Dicer1 enhances lung tumourigenesis driven by oncogenic Kras41, sarcoma development
induced by KrasG12D and loss of p5341, and retinoblastoma formation induced by deletion
of Rb1 and p10742. In the lung model, complete inactivation of Dicer1 improved survival
compared to animals with mono-allelic Dicer1 deletion41. Tumours that did develop in the
Dicer1flox/flox animals retained one wild-type allele and partial Dicer1 expression, strongly
suggesting that partial loss of Dicer1 promotes tumourigenesis.
A recent in vivo shRNA-based screening approach identified lymphoma tumour suppressors,
including one, the cell cycle regulator Rad17, which appeared to function as a TSG with
obligate haploinsufficiency43. The use of multiple hairpins targeting Rad17 led to the
discovery that only hairpins that partially suppressed Rad17 promoted lymphomagenesis
whereas hairpins that completely repressed Rad17 expression were selected against in the
lymphomas. This study highlights the utility of shRNA knockdown and screening
technologies for the identification of haploinsufficient TSGs.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NPM1, found mutated and translocated in hematopoietic malignancies, also displays
obligate haploinsufficiency. Whereas single-allelic deletion of NPM1 induces tumour
formation in mice44, biallelic loss induces embryonic lethality and is also incompatible with
cell growth after conditional deletion ex vivo45. Although more data is needed, the TSGs
TAp63 and PinX1 may also display obligate haploinsufficiency; heterozygosity for TAp63
promoted tumourigenesis to a greater degree than complete loss of TAp63 in genetically
engineered mice, and tumours that developed in the heterozygous mice did not display loss
of the wild-type allele46. Similarly, PinX1, recently identified as a haploinsufficient tumour
suppressor47, may also display obligate haploinsufficiency; heterozygous loss of PinX1 in a
mouse model promoted cancer development in multiple organs, and tumours did not lose the
wild-type allele or expression of PinX147.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A genome-wide screening study in yeast indicated that about 3% of the genes in the yeast
genome displayed haploinsufficiency when assayed under specific growth conditions48.
These haploinsufficient genes were enriched for ribosomal genes and genes that are highly
expressed. Currently, mammalian tumour suppressors that exhibit haploinsufficiency do not
appear to conform to one specific functional class. Besides p53 and PTEN, dozens of other
TSGs exhibit haploinsufficiency for tumour suppression49,50, many of which we have
discussed above. These TSGs come from many functional classes, including transcription
factors (e.g. PAX5 and TAp63), cell cycle checkpoint genes (RAD17), E3 ligases (FBW7),
ribosomal or associated proteins (NPM1), and other diverse genes such as Dicer1 and
PinX1.

A continuum model for tumour suppression
Rather than TSG function and activity following discrete, step-wise changes, evidence is
emerging that supports the dosage-dependency of TSG function. Data from an allelic series
of targeted Pten alleles that results in varying levels of Pten in vivo in geneticallyengineered mice51,52 demonstrate the tight correlation between Pten expression level and
function. Taking advantage of a null Pten allele in combination with a Pten “hy” allele,
which is expressed at a lower level than the wild-type allele, an allelic series was created in
which Pten expression follows a decreasing pattern in the order Pten+/+ > Ptenhy/+ > Pten+/−
> Ptenhy/−. Surprisingly, Ptenhy/+ animals, with cells expressing 80% of the normal level of
Pten, did display many of the phenotypes observed in Pten+/− animals, such as

Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 November 2.

Berger et al.

lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and mammary gland tumours52. Moreover, survival of
Ptenhy/+ animals is compromised compared to Pten+/+ controls, but not to the same degree
as the survival impairment in Pten+/− animals52. Thus, the tumour incidence and survival of
the animals correlate with the Pten expression level52. Critically, mammary tumours from
Ptenhy/+ animals do not show loss of Pten expression or loss of the wild-type Pten allele and
exhibit a Pten dose-dependent increase in activation of Akt, further demonstrating that a
subtle reduction in Pten dose can result in deregulated signalling and cancer52. Similarly, in
the murine prostate, a progressive lowering of Pten levels correlates with Akt activation,
prostate enlargement, proliferation of prostate cells and tumourigenesis51. These in vivo
studies demonstrate that even a subtle 20% reduction of protein level could constitute an
important “hit” involved in the development of cancer. We termed this state: TSG “quasiinsufficiency”52 (Figure 1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Thus, protein function can be a continuum that is related to the level of expression or
activity of the TSG rather than to discrete step-by-step changes in gene copy number. We
therefore propose a shift from the classical discrete model of tumour suppression to a
continuum model (Figure 3). This model takes into account the fact that subtle regulation of
TSGs can have profound consequences on cancer susceptibility and/or progression, and in
turn has important implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Note that while the
function of PTEN appears to be strongly coupled to its expression level, for other TSGs it
will be the activity of the protein and not the expression level that may be critical. This
situation is readily observed in tumours with p53 mutation where the mutant allele is highly
expressed but functionally inactive or acting as a dominant negative.
Like the effect on TSGs, dosage can be extremely important for regulating the cellular
effects of oncogene expression. Dramatically different consequences for the cell and for
cancer development can occur depending on the level of oncogene expression. For example,
high expression of oncogenic, mutated RAS genes drives senescence, not proliferation53.
Similarly, robust expression of MYC induces apoptosis, not proliferation54. These examples
mirror the paradigm of PICS and “obligate haploinsufficiency” and suggest that tumours
may select for optimal expression of oncogenes. Data to support this notion exist already in
the rampant amplification of mutated oncogenes, such as the amplification of the mutated
EGFR gene in human lung cancer55,56. Such data suggests that it is not only mutation of an
oncogene that is important for cancer, but also its expression level. In this respect, the
continuum model could also apply to oncogenes (Figure 3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It appears now that some TSGs are exquisitely sensitive to dose (e.g. PTEN), some are
intermediately sensitive (e.g. p53) and others are more resistant to expression level and/or
activity changes (e.g. RB1). Those that are most resistant to changes in expression or
activity, such as RB1, will be most likely to conform to the two-hit hypothesis whereas those
that are exquisitely sensitive to dose may exhibit frequent monoallelic deletion/mutation or
be misregulated in cancer via other means, such as miRNA overexpression. Moreover,
tumour suppressors that exhibit “obligate haploinsufficiency” due to the lethality of
homozygous inactivation of the TSG will never exhibit complete inactivation in cancer
unless there are other context- or genotype-dependent events that favour their complete
inactivation (as in the case of Pten/p53 discussed above).
The dogma that every TSG must behave according to the two-hit paradigm could
significantly slow the pace of cancer research by dismissing potentially critical genes as
unimportant. The pace of cancer drug development will in turn be delayed by a lack of
appreciation of the involvement of these potentially druggable pathways in tumour
development and maintenance. A very real challenge for cancer biologists in the next decade
will be first to define the TSGs affected by haploinsufficiency and then to model these subtle

dosage effects in a way that can yield quantitative models of cancer risk or outcome. Since
human genetics analysis alone is often not enough to unequivocally identify critical
haploinsufficient genes, mouse models will prove essential to define which genes exhibit
haploinsufficiency for TSG function and in which specific cellular and genetic contexts.

Regulation of TSG activity
The continuum model of tumour suppression holds that precise regulation of TSG
expression and activity is critical and thus, mechanisms of regulation of expression and
function may powerfully contribute to tumour suppression. One of the most widespread
networks of expression regulation is the post-transcriptional regulatory network of
microRNAs (miRNAs) and competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). In addition to these
networks, TSG dosage/activity is regulated by transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational mechanisms (Figure 4). These networks open up the realm of genes that could
be contextually important for tumourigenesis, especially when considering mechanisms that
tune TSG activity and not only those that function as on/off switches.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As an example, a powerful PTEN-targeting miRNA network was recently identified.
MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate protein expression through
inhibition of protein translation or induction of direct cleavage of their mRNA targets via
RISC57. Many of the PTEN-targeting miRNAs are amplified or overexpressed in cancer
such as miR-26 in glioma58 and miR-22 in prostate cancer59. The regulation of coding
RNAs by miRNAs is made additionally complex through the interaction of miRNAs with
ceRNAs60,61. We coined the term “competing endogenous RNA” (ceRNA), to refer to an
RNA – coding or noncoding – that shares miRNA binding sites with another RNA with
which it competes for miRNA binding60,61. Any two or more mRNAs with shared miRNA
recognition elements (MRE) can act as ceRNAs towards each other by competing for
miRNA binding and thereby co-regulating each other's expression. As the expression of the
ceRNA increases, the miRNA binding sites on the ceRNA compete with the miRNA
binding sites on the other transcript, and less miRNA is available for binding to the TSG
transcript (Figure 4). CeRNA expression (e.g. expression of the PTEN pseudogene60), hence
results in sustained TSG expression by preventing miRNA binding to the TSG and
subsequent mRNA or protein downregulation. Conversely, loss of ceRNA expression could
result in low TSG expression through diversion of additional miRNA molecules to the TSG
transcript60,61. Even non-coding ceRNAs that are not expressed at the protein level could
function as TSGs by regulating expression of protein-coding TSGs, and mutation or deletion
of ceRNA genes could be important in cancer60,61.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Implications for cancer susceptibility and therapy
An appreciation of the continuous nature of tumour suppressive function must in turn lead to
a re-evaluation of the role of TSG dosage in cancer susceptibility, diagnosis, and treatment.
Subtle variation in TSG expression or activity could underlie genetic variation in cancer
susceptibility in the population. Inherent, constitutive differences in gene expression could
be caused by polymorphic variation in TSG promoter regions or in miRNA binding sites or
other regulatory regions. Importantly, synonymous SNPs that do not change the protein
sequence of an expressed gene could still have a powerful impact by altering the level of
TSG expression through alteration of miRNA binding. Moreover, SNPs in non-coding
RNAs could impact tumour development through ceRNA effects. Alternatively, on the basis
of a continuum model, susceptibility to cancer could be induced by environmental factors
through subtle transcriptional up- or down-regulation of relevant genes. Development of
drugs that prevent and counter these fluctuations could be used as chemopreventative agents

to reduce the impact of environmental carcinogens or to correct the effects of inherited
predisposing factors.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Just as transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation may determine cancer susceptibility,
it could also be harnessed for cancer prevention and therapy (Table 1). As an example,
statins, which are already in clinical use, were recently found to upregulate PTEN through
PPARγ signaling62. Statins or PTEN-enhancing drugs could therefore be utilized not only to
treat dyslipidemic cases but also to elevate PTEN expression in patients with tumours with
lowered levels of PTEN (Figure 5). Importantly, such an approach would require a
quantitative analysis of the expression levels of TSGs and oncogenes and not solely a
genetic assessment of their presence or absence.
TSG-targeting microRNAs add another dimension to genotype/phenotype considerations in
targeted cancer prevention and therapy. Overexpression of one or more of TSG-targeting
miRNAs in cancer could confer cancer susceptibility, and tumours not showing genetic
alterations in the TSG but with aberrant TSG levels due to miRNA misregulation could
behave similarly to tumours with genetic deletion or mutation of the gene. Mapping the
interactions between miRNAs and TSGs could be useful for defining and predicting tumour
response to therapy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Provocatively, tumours with partial loss of TSGs like PTEN that display “obligate
haploinsufficiency” might be treated with agents to fully suppress the expression of the
TSG, thereby suppressing tumour growth via senescence or other fail-safe mechanisms
(Figure 5). Alternatively, when a TSG is completely lost, activation of alternative tumour
suppressive pathways or synthetic lethality approaches could be considered63 (Figure 5).
The success of such strategies would obviously depend on the integrity of the fail-safe
response and the expression level of the TSG, once again requiring a careful annotation of
the molecular characteristics of the cancer lesion subjected to treatment. The need for the
same careful annotation is not restricted to targeted therapies but applies to any cancer
therapy since variations of oncogene or TSG dosage may well be at the core of failure of
more conventional radio- or chemo-therapies.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

On this basis, the scientific challenge going forward will be to develop quantitative assays
that can assess and score subtle differences in TSG gene expression to allow accurate
diagnostics and prediction of risk/prognosis. Such diagnostics will also be important for
analysis and prediction of response to therapeutics, since subtle variations could also
determine response to therapy. A tumour with a partial downregulation of a TSG could
respond differently from a tumour that has either no alteration of the TSG or complete
mutation/loss of the gene (Figure 5). Critically, in cases where a tumour shows
downregulation of a TSG via transcriptional repression, epigenetic downregulation, or
aberrant miRNA and ceRNA regulation, there is an opportunity to explore therapeutic
restoration of TSG expression.
The recent explosion of knowledge in the field of non-coding RNA biology has opened a
new frontier in understanding gene dosage regulation and its involvement in tumourigenesis.
In the months and years to come, careful experimentation is required to map out the
networks of gene regulation of TSGs and oncogenes to allow drug development and creation
of diagnostics from this information. Forty years after the twohit hypothesis, we are refining
and extending our understanding of TSG inactivation in cancer. Milestones made in these
past forty years have contributed to the decline in cancer deaths observed in the US since
199064. The next decades promise further relief from the burden of cancer as we continue to
tease out its molecular genetic basis.

Preface

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

2011 marks the forty-year anniversary of the statistical analysis of retinoblastoma that
provided the first evidence that tumourigenesis could be initiated by as few as two
mutations. This work provided the foundation for the “two-hit” hypothesis that explained
the role of recessive tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) in dominantly inherited cancer
susceptibility syndromes. However, four decades later, it is now known that even partial
inactivation of tumour suppressors can critically contribute to tumourigenesis. Here we
analyse this evidence and propose a continuum model of TSG function to explain the full
range of TSG mutations found in cancer.

Figure 1. Paradigms of tumour suppression

A black gradient represents a continuum of expression that is also related to the number of
alleles present (gray numbering). Left, the two-hit paradigm as exemplified by the tumour
suppressor, RB. Loss of one allele induces cancer susceptibility; loss of two alleles induces
cancer. Middle, classic haploinsufficiency. Loss of one allele is sufficient for induction of
cancer. Right, Quasi-sufficiency and obligate haploinsufficiency. Quasi-sufficiency refers to
the phenomenon whereby tumour suppression is impaired after subtle expression
downregulation without loss of even one allele. Obligate haploinsufficiency occurs when
TSG haploinsufficiency is more tumourigenic than complete loss of the TSG, usually due to
the activation of fail-safe mechanisms following complete loss of TSG expression.

Figure 2. Tissue specificity and context dependency of tumour suppression

The phenotypic outcome of a reduction in PTEN expression is differentially manifested
depending upon tissue type and genetic background. WD, well-differentiated. PD, poorlydifferentiated. LA, lymphadenopathy. SM, splenomegaly. HSC, hematopoietic stem cell.
BM, bone marrow. The effect of complete loss of PTEN is highly context dependent due to
the obligate haploinsufficiency caused by PTEN loss-induced cellular senescence (PICS).
Data summarized here come from multiple groups and studies of genetically-engineered
mice with differing PTEN alleles and expression38–40,52,65–68.

Figure 3. The continuum model of tumour suppression

The classical discrete, stepwise model of tumour suppression (left) is contrasted with a
continuum model of tumour suppression and oncogenesis (centre and right, respectively). In
the discrete model, tumourigenesis is induced by either complete loss of a TSG (two-hit
paradigm, dark blue) or after single-copy loss of a TSG (haploinsufficiency, light blue). In
contrast, we propose a continuum model (centre and right), in which tumour suppression is
related to a continuum of TSG expression, rather than to discrete changes in DNA copy
number. A continuum of increasing TSG expression will generally be negatively correlated
with malignancy (centre, light green) whereas increasing oncogene expression will generally
be positively correlated with malignancy (right, red). A linear relationship is depicted for
schematic purposes, but the dose-response relationship need not be linear. In some cases,
fail-safe mechanisms are induced by complete loss of TSG expression or by massive
oncogene overexpression. In these cases, complete loss of TSG expression (centre, dark
green) or massive overexpression of an oncogene (right, orange) will be negatively
correlated with malignancy, as shown.

Figure 4. Mechanisms of regulation of TSG dosage

The interaction between coding and non-coding factors determines final TSG dosage.
Classic mechanisms such as DNA copy number (1), transcriptional regulation (2), and
epigenetic silencing can impact expression of TSG mRNA. TSG mRNA level or translation
into protein is then regulated by miRNAs (4). The availability of miRNAs for TSG
downregulation is further regulated by ceRNA-mediated sponging effects (3). Finally,
additional translational regulation (6) or post-translational modifications contribute to the
final protein expression, function and effective dosage. The protein structure shown is PTEN
(PDB ID: 1D5R).

Figure 5. Opportunities for therapeutic intervention after partial or complete loss of TSG
expression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumour genotype ultimately determines which therapies can be considered for intervention.
Broadly, two general approaches can be taken: restoration of the TSG pathway or function
(upper panel) or induction of fail-safe mechanisms by complete downregulation of the TSG
(lower panel). In tumours with downregulation of TSG expression in the absence of
complete mutation or deletion, expression of the TSG can be attempted using drugs that
induce the TSG transcription, inhibit miRNA-induced TSG downregulation, or relieve
epigenetic silencing. Alternatively, fail-safe mechanisms may be induced by further
downregulation of the TSG, such as inhibition of PTEN by the small molecule VO-OHpic69.
In tumours with mutation or complete loss of the TSG, activation of other TSG pathways
could be pursued. Alternatively, if a synthetic lethality relationship with the TSG is known,
then the synthetic lethal gene can be targeted to induce cell death in the cells with complete
loss of the TSG.
