Abstract

Author Manuscript

Levels of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) are frequently elevated in human cancers and in
some instances have been associated with poor prognosis and outcome. Here we utilize transgenic
and allograft breast cancer models to demonstrate that increased mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) signalling can be a significant contributor to breast cancer progression in vivo.
Suppressing mTOR activity, as well as levels and activity of the downstream translation regulators,
eIF4E and eIF4A, delayed breast cancer progression, onset of associated pulmonary metastasis in
vivo and breast cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro. Translation of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and cyclin D1 mRNAs, which encode
products associated with the metastatic phenotype, is inhibited upon eIF4E suppression. Our
results indicate that the mTOR/eIF4F axis is an important contributor to tumor maintenance and
progression programs in breast cancer. Targeting this pathway may be of therapeutic benefit.

INTRODUCTION
Author Manuscript

Recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA templates is generally the rate-limiting step of
translation initiation and is mediated by eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F—a
heterotrimeric complex consisting of: (1) eIF4E, the cap-binding protein responsible for
binding to mRNA cap structures; (2) eIF4A, an RNA helicase required to unwind local
secondary structure and facilitate access of the 43S ribosomal complex to mRNA templates;
and (3) eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein. The availability of the eIF4F complex is regulated

by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding
partners, called 4E-BP (there are three 4E-BPs with the best characterized being 4E-BP1).
Increased signalling flux through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway
leads to an mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which in turn augments its
dissociation from eIF4E and stimulates eIF4F complex formation.1 The PI3K/Akt pathway
also regulates the availability of eIF4A for eIF4F complex assembly.2

Author Manuscript

In human cancers, including breast malignancies, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling axis is
frequently deregulated as a consequence of genetic alterations or epigenetic changes that
result in constitutive pathway activation. A prominent consequence of elevated PI3K/Akt/
mTOR activity is deregulated translational control—a feature implicated in tumor initiation
and maintenance in a number of in vitro and in vivo settings.3 – 5 There is thus considerable
interest in targeting this pathway in cancer, either by inhibiting mTOR (using rapalogs or
mTOR-kinase inhibitors (KIs)) or PI3K/mTOR activity (using PI3K/mTOR-KIs), the
expectation being that tumors bearing lesions in the PI3K pathway have acquired
dependency on its activity to support their growth and survival programs.6 Some of the
therapeutics effects of rapalogs and PI3K/mTOR-KIs appear to be a consequence of
inhibitory effects on the translational regulatory node in tumor cells as elevated eIF4E levels
can bypass tumor cell sensitivity to mTOR inhibition in vivo7 and is a genetic modifier of
PI3K/mTOR-KI sensitivity in vitro in human mammary epithelial cells.8 MYC amplification
also leads to PI3K-independent breast cancer cell survival and resistance to PI3K inhibitors9
and can overcome the proliferative block induced by PI3K/TOR-KIs.10 eIF4E, eIF4AI and
eIF4G are transcriptional targets of MYC and may be contributing to the MYC phenotype in
these drug-resistant settings.11 – 13

Perturbing eIF4F activity, either as a consequence of elevated eIF4E levels or
hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1, is associated with, and thought to promote, breast cancer
cell maintenance and progression through translational deregulation of a number of
oncogenic drivers and inhibitors.14,15 In human tumors, the phosphorylation status of 4EBP116 and eIF4E/4E-BP levels17 have been reported to be associated with malignant
progression and adverse progression in breast cancer. Ectopic overexpression of 4E-BP1
mutant,15,18 or suppression of eIF4E expression,19,20 both of which repress cap-dependent
translation initiation, significantly decreases cell proliferation and survival of breast tumor
cells. eIF4E is a genetic modifier of anti-HER2-directed therapies, such as the FDA (Food
and Drug Administration)-approved trastuzumab antibody, in breast cancer, with high levels
capable of rescuing growth inhibition in vitro and associated with drug resistance in
xenograft models.21 Therapeutic strategies targeting eIF4E by antisense inhibition,22 or with
a small-molecule inhibitor that removes the eIF4A helicase from the eIF4F complex,23
delays growth of breast cancer cells in xenograft models. Here we utilize the wellcharacterized MMTV-PyMT transgenic model, where breast neoplasia is induced by
restricted expression of polyoma virus middle T antigen in the mammary epithelium,24 to
explore the therapeutic potential of inhibiting eIF4F activity. Our results suggest a rationale
for targeting eIF4F to curtail breast cancer maintenance and progression.

RESULTS
Reductions in Tsc2 expression cooperate with oncogenic signalling in breast cancer
metastasis

Author Manuscript

Given the association between increased PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity and breast cancer (see
Introduction), we wished to determine in a genetically controlled setting if increased mTOR
signalling flux (and thus potentially increased eIF4F levels) could affect tumor onset and
maintenance in this disease in vivo. Our model consisted of intercrossing two transgenic
mouse models. First, we used the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model, which not only
morphologically recapitulates the progression of human breast cancer from hyperplasia to
carcinoma, but also leads to pulmonary metastasis ~8 weeks following tumor onset.24,25 The
similarity of this model with the human disease is exemplified by the loss of steroid
hormone receptors and β1-integrin associated with increased ErbB2 and cyclin D1
expression in late-stage disease.26 We placed the MMTV-PyMT transgene onto the C57Bl/6
background as this has been shown to significantly delay tumor onset.27,28

To establish a setting of activated mTOR signalling, we took advantage of Tsc2+/− mice. The
tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic disorder characterized by hamartomas in different
organs, is the result of mutations in either one of two tumor-suppressor genes, Tsc1 and
Tsc2. TSC1 and TSC2 form a complex that integrate different signalling cues to control
mTOR activity.6,29 TSC2 contains a GTPase Activating Protein domain that stimulates the
GTPase of Rheb (which in its GTP-bound form is an activator of mTOR Complex I).
Although Tsc1 or Tsc2 mutations are rare in sporadic human cancers,30 human tumors show
reduced levels of TSC1 or TSC2,31 – 33 including breast cancer.34 We asked if mTOR
signalling flux could be limiting for either primary tumor or metastasis onset in the MMTVPyMT model by crossing Tsc2+/− and MMTV-PyMT mice. PyMT/Tsc2+/+ and PyMT/
Tsc2+/− females showed a similar tumor onset time (median of 121 – 123 days; Figure 1a),
with no significant differences in overall tumor burden (Figure 1b) or growth
(Supplementary Figure S1). We noted increased mTOR signalling flux in primary PyMT/
Tsc2+/− tumors compared with PyMT/Tsc2+/+ tumors as measured by elevated phospho-S6
levels (Figures 1c and d, Supplementary Figure S2). Primary PyMT/Tsc2+/− tumors also
showed reduced TSC2 levels relative to PyMT/Tsc2+/+ tumors (Figures 1c and d), with
levels below the 50% decrease expected for monoallelic expression. This was not a
consequence of reduction to homozygosity by the mutant allele, as the wild-type Tsc2 allele
was retained in all PyMT/Tsc2+/− tumor samples (Supplementary Figure S3). We attribute
the almost complete loss of Tsc2 expression to epigenetic changes that might further
dampen TSC2 production—an event that may favor tumorigenic progression, but this
hypothesis will require more direct testing. Histopathological analysis of PyMT/Tsc2+/+and PyMT/Tsc2+/−-derived tumors indicated that both genotypes develop multifocal
adenocarcinomas with similar appearance, size and properties (necrosis, cellular atypia,
mitotic apoptotic index; data not shown). However, we noted a threefold increase in the
number of pulmonary metastasis in PyMT/Tsc2+/− mice 8 weeks following appearance of
primary tumors compared with PyMT/Tsc2+/+ mice (Figure 1e). Most of the lung lesions
were glandular/papillary in nature (data not shown), and lesions from PyMT/Tsc2+/− mice
were generally larger than those from PyMT/Tsc2+/+ mice, suggesting an earlier onset time

(Figure 1f). These results suggest that whereas mTOR activation does not appear limiting for
primary tumor initiation and burden, reduced Tsc2 expression cooperates with PyMT to
increase pulmonary metastasis in this model.
Inhibition of mTOR suppresses PyMT-induced breast cancer development and pulmonary
metastasis

Author Manuscript

We next asked if the increased metastatic burden observed in PyMT/Tsc2+/− mice upon Tsc2
loss was a consequence of increased mTOR signalling flux. Treatment of tumor-bearing
mice with rapamycin (RAP) caused a reduction in lung metastasis in both PyMT/Tsc2+/+
and PyMT/Tsc2+/− RAP-treated mice (Figure 2a). Pulmonary tissues and metastases showed
reduced p-S6 staining, indicating that RAP was effectively inhibiting mTOR flux in the
target tissues (Figures 2b and Supplementary Figure S4). RAP also reduced primary tumor
burden regardless of genotype (Figure 2c). This appeared to be a consequence of increased
cell death (Figures 2d and Supplementary Figure S5) in both the primary tumors and
pulmonary metastasis. In contrast, RAP appeared to exert little effect on tumor cell
proliferation (Figures 2e and Supplementary Figure S5). Whereas these results define a
critical role for mTOR signalling in breast cancer maintenance in this model, they do not
allow us to determine if the reduction in pulmonary metastasis observed with RAP is a direct
consequence of the effects on the metastatic program or secondary to inhibition of primary
tumor maintenance.

Author Manuscript

Therefore, to more directly assess the consequences of mTORC1 inhibition on features of
the metastatic program, we turned to the murine TM15 metastatic breast cancer cell line—a
HER2-driven model dependent on activation of the HER3/PI3K axis.35 We also specifically
targeted the downstream mTOR effector, eIF4F, using silvestrol and hippuristanol, the two
small-molecule inhibitors that block its eIF4A-driven helicase activity.36,37 Both compounds
inhibit translation in a dose-dependent manner in TM15 cells (Supplementary Figure S6A)
at concentrations significantly lower than those required to induce substantial cell death
(Supplementary Figure S6B). We therefore assessed the effects of silvestrol, hippuristanol
and RAP on two properties of TM15 cells that relate to the metastatic process—cellular
migration and invasion. When TM15 cells were exposed to 20 nM RAP, or to the halfmaximal inhibitory concentration of silvestrol or hippuristanol required for inhibition of
translation, cell migration and invasion were significantly impaired (Figures 3a–c),
indicating that reductions in mTORC1 or eIF4A/eIF4F helicase activity reduce metastatic
potential in this setting.

Author Manuscript

To determine if suppression of eIF4E levels could phenocopy these results, we took
advantage of an inducible RNA interference (RNAi) strategy to engineer a potent small
hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting eIF4E (sh4E.389) or a neutral control shRNA to firefly
luciferase (shFLuc.1309) into a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible retroviral vector. Suppression
of eIF4E in TM15 cells (Figure 3d) was also sufficient to impair cell migration and invasion
(Figures 3e and f). As previously reported,19,38 knockdown of eIF4E caused a prolongation
of the G1 cell cycle phase (Figure 3g). Similar results were obtained using a second,
independent shRNA to eIF4E, sh4E.610 (Supplementary Figure S7A–C). Taken together,

these data suggest that inhibition of translation initiation can significantly affect the
metastatic program.

Author Manuscript

To assess the consequences of targeting translation initiation in vivo on TM15 cell tumor
growth and metastatic potential, we injected sh4E.389- and shFLuc.1309-infected cells into
the fat pads of female BALB/c nude mice. When tumors were palpable, shRNAmir
expression was activated by DOX administration. As observed in the PyMT-driven breast
cancer model treated with RAP (Figure 2), a significant inhibitory effect on primary tumor
growth (Figure 4a) and pulmonary metastatic burden (Figure 4b) was detected upon in vivo
suppression of eIF4E. In some cases in DOX-treated mice, staining for green fluorescent
protein (GFP) and knockdown of eIF4E was not homogenous throughout the tumor area but
appeared focal in nature (Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure S8). This likely reflects
corruption of the rtTA/TRE-inducible system in the tumor setting, as has been previously
documented,39 and may underestimate the effect of eIF4E suppression in this setting.
Apoptosis was elevated in primary tumors and metastatic lesions in which eIF4E expression
was suppressed (Figure 4d), whereas no effect on Ki-67 staining upon eIF4E suppression
was noted (Figure 4e). The increased apoptosis apparent in the metastatic lesions is
suggestive of a direct effect on cellular viability upon eIF4E suppression.
Suppression of eIF4E affects the metastasis cascade

Author Manuscript

In a separate set of experiments aimed at removing the constraints of primary tumor growth
on cell extravasation, we injected shRNAmir-TM15 cells intravenously into recipient mice
to allow tumor cell dissemination and seeding. Here also, eIF4E suppression resulted in
reduced metastatic burden (Figures 5a and b). To assess if these differences could be
observed early in the colonization process, we analyzed lungs at different time points
following injection of tumor cells. It was clear that eIF4E suppression led to both a decrease
in the number of cells colonizing the lungs (Figure 5c) and a reduction in growth rate of
those lesions that did colonize relative to shFLuc.1309-infected controls (Figures 5d–f).
These results suggest that eIF4E suppression can interfere with the metastasis cascadeprocesses distinct from the effects documented on primary tumor burden above.
Suppression of eIF4E diminishes translation of mRNAs whose products have been
implicated in metastasis

Author Manuscript

To gain insight into the molecular basis of eIF4E suppression on TM15 tumor cell growth
and metastatic potential, we determined if the translation of growth- and metastasisregulatory mRNAs was affected. Global polysome profiles from TM15 cells were not
dramatically affected upon eIF4E suppression (Figure 6a). However, we noticed a reduction
in the levels of proteins encoded by transcripts previously shown to be eIF4E dependent and
implicated in the oncogenic and metastatic processes (that is, vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)), invasion through the extracellular matrix (that is, degrading enzymes such
as matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9)), and cell cycle progression (cyclin D1)40 (Figure 6b).
To determine if reduced translation activity was contributing to the diminished protein
levels, we documented the distribution of VEGF, MMP9 and cyclin D1 mRNAs in
polysomes from sh4E.389- and shFLuc.1309-infected TM15 cells (Figure 6c). Shifts from
heavy to lighter polysomes of VEGF, MMP9 and cyclin D1 mRNAs in sh4E.389-infected as

compared with shFLuc.1309-infected TM15 cells were noted (Figure 6c). In contrast, the
distribution of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA, a transcript
whose expression is not altered upon suppression of eIF4E activity (data not shown), showed
little difference among polysomes from sh4E.389- or shFLuc.1309-infected cells (Figure
6c). The subtle but consistent shifts from heavier to lighter polysomes indicate that whereas
translation of the target mRNAs is being affected, additional gene regulatory mechanisms
not queried here may also contribute to the decrease in VEGF, MMP9 and cyclin D1 protein
levels observed upon eIF4E knockdown. Taken together, these results demonstrate that
eIF4E suppression in TM15 cells dampens translation of several key mRNAs encoding
proteins implicated in the metastatic process.
Deregulated eIF4E expression affects invasion and migration in human breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To determine if our results could be extended to the human setting, we undertook several
complementary approaches to modulate eIF4E levels in breast cancer cells and link this to
invasion and migration. As overexpression of eIF4E in breast cancer has been linked to
poorer survival,41 we assessed if overexpression of eIF4E in cells could increase their
metastatic potential (Figure 7). For these purposes, we chose to ectopically overexpress
eIF4E in the weakly metastatic, HER2-negative MDA-MB-468 cell line using a DOXinducible `All-In-One' retroviral vector (Figures 7a and b).42 Indeed, elevated eIF4E levels
were associated with increased migration and invasion in this setting (Figures 7c and d).

Author Manuscript

Next, we used RNAi to suppress eIF4E expression in the highly metastatic, HER2-negative
MDA-MB-231 cell line (Figure 8a). Knockdown of eIF4E by shRNAs or small interfering
iRNAs reduced by 2.5-fold the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, relative to
shFLuc.1309-infected cells (Figures 8b and c). Associated with eIF4E suppression in MDAMB-231 cells was a prolongation of the G1 cell cycle phase (Figure 8d).
We also injected MDA-MB-231 cells into the tail vein of nude mice and assessed the effects
on dissemination and seeding upon suppression of eIF4F activity with silvestrol. Mice
receiving silvestrol showed a significant decrease in the number and size of metastatic
lesions (Figures 8e and f). These results phenocopy those obtained with TM15 cells upon
suppression of eIF4E by RNAi (Figure 5), making it unlikely that the former results were
cell line specific. Taken together, these results indicate that altering eIF4E levels can
significantly affect the migration and invasion potential of human breast cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

Herein, we utilize powerful transgenic mouse models and RNAi to validate a link between
deregulated mTOR/eIF4E signalling and primary breast cancer maintenance and metastasis
in vivo. Loss of Tsc2, and hence increased mTOR signalling, in mice harboring the PyMT
mutation had little effect on primary tumor onset, burden or histology, but did affect
metastatic burden (Figure 1). In both PyMT/Tsc2+/+ and PyMT/Tsc2+/− mice, inhibiting
mTOR signalling with RAP exerted effects on primary tumor development and pulmonary
metastasis (Figure 2). PyMT/Tsc2+/+ tumors likely respond to RAP because the PyMT
transgene activates PI3K signalling—an event necessary for stimulation of survival
signalling pathways in these tumors.43 In this regard, it will be interesting to assess if Tsc2

loss increases pulmonary metastasis in the mutant PyMT (Y315/322F) mouse, a transgenic
strain where PyMT-mediated PI3K activation is reduced ~75% and where this diminished
signalling is associated with a reduced penetrance of pulmonary metastasis.43 The increase
in metastatic burden seen in PyMT/Tsc2+/− mice would suggest that mTOR signalling is
limiting for, or another Tsc2 effector contributes to, this process. The differential effect of
RAP versus genetic reduction of Tsc2 on primary tumor burden (Figures 1b and 2c) may be
due to reduced Tsc2 levels affecting only mTORC1 activity, whereas long-term treatment
with RAP inhibits mTORC1, mTORC2 assembly and Akt/protein kinase B signalling, as
previously reported.44 RAP and eIF4E suppression exerted direct effects on metastatic cell
survival (Figures 2d and 4d) as assessed by increased apoptosis detected in pulmonary
metastasis in treated animals.

Pathways that impinge on translational control have been previously targeted in breast
cancer cell lines. Jiang et al.45 generated a mutant of 4E-BP1 whose binding to eIF4E could
not be reversed by mTOR. When expressed in the human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, this
mutant inhibited proliferation.45 An innovative approach in which the eIF4E-binding
segment of eIF4G1 was stabilized by an α-helical inducer and fused to the cell-permeable
TAT peptide also inhibited cap-dependent translation and triggered apoptosis in MCF-7
cells.46 Dowling et al.47 have shown that translation can be suppressed in MCF-7 cells with
metformin, an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase that regulates cellular energy
metabolism and mTOR activity. In vivo, metformin is effective as adjuvant therapy against
xenograft models of breast cancer,48 but whether this is related to a translational block is not
known. The mTOR inhibitors, RAP and PP242, have shown effects on cell cycle progression
in breast cancer cells in vitro—a response that correlates with the presence of PI3K
mutations.49 We have also previously reported that silvestrol, a small-molecule inhibitor of
eIF4A, is effective at curtailing tumor maintenance in vivo in a xenograft model of breast
cancer cells.23 eIF4E suppression by RNAi in breast cancer cells has also been shown to
reduce foci formation, enhance chemosensitivity, reduce cell migration and delay primary
tumor onset in nude mice.19,20 Here we extend these studies by demonstrating that eIF4F
inhibition: (1) suppresses mouse and human breast cancer cell migration and invasion, (2)
affects the metastasis cascade in vivo (Figures 5 and 8e–f) and (3) we identify mRNA targets
whose translation is suppressed upon eIF4E knockdown in TM15 cells and implicated in the
metastatic program (Figure 6).

Author Manuscript

Both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells have been extensively analyzed for their eIF4F
status.15 MDA-MB-231 cells express more eIF4F than MDA-MB-468 cells and are more
resistant to apoptosis induced by serum starvation,15 a feature consistent with MDAMB-231 being the more metastatic line.42 Introduction of eIF4E confers upon human
mammary epithelial cells the ability to form anchorage-dependent colonies on plastic
substrates as well as anchorage-independent growth in soft agar.15 In our hands, ectopic
overexpression of eIF4E in human MDA-MB-468 breast cells also increased their migration
and invasion properties (Figure 7). In addition to elevated eIF4E levels, altered expression
levels of a number of other translation factors or regulators (for example, PKR, eIF3a, eIF3e,
eIF4G and 4E-BPs) have been documented in human breast cancer.50 The complexity of the
situation is highlighted by the fact that inflammatory breast cancer shows elevated levels of
eIF4GI—a feature postulated to reprogram the translational apparatus for increased internal

initiation events that drive inflammatory breast cancer cell survival and tumor emboli
formation.

With respect to metastasis, less is known about the role that deregulated translation may play
in supporting this process. Differences in eIF4E levels have been correlated with invasion
potential in vivo among a number of different cell lines in lung seeding and renal capsule
invasion assays.51 As well, inhibition of Mnk-directed phosphorylation of eIF4E reduced
metastasis in a B16 melanoma model.52 In a murine ovarian cancer model, ascites tumor
burden was significantly reduced by use of 4EBP-based peptides that blocked interaction of
eIF4E with eIF4G.53 By utilizing TM15 cells and RNAi-mediated suppression of eIF4E, we
were able to document direct effects on the metastatic properties of cell invasion and
migration, as well as distinguish between effects of suppressing translation initiation on this
process from other RAP-inhibited processes (Figure 3). TM15 cells are dependent on the
HER3/PI3K axis for their survival, and inhibiting eIF4F function significantly dampened the
metastatic program in vitro (Figure 3)—likely through decreasing production of regulators
involved in this process (Figure 6). The requirement of eIF4F for ribosome recruitment is
not equivalent among mRNAs, with a subset of mRNA species being more responsive to
alterations in eIF4F levels, some of which also play roles in cell growth, survival,
angiogenesis and tissue remodelling.54 Taken together, our results suggest that inhibiting
eIF4F/eIF4A activity in breast cancer may have therapeutic potential in affecting not only
primary tumor maintenance but also the metastasis program.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells (106 cells/ml) were fixed in 75% ethanol solution for 1 h at 4 °C and stained with
propidium iodide (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario, Canada; 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 3.8 mM

Cell invasion and migration assays

Author Manuscript

Cell invasion and migration potential was measured using an in vitro chamber assay.57
Approximately 105 cells in 0.5 ml serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were
added to the wells of 8 μm pore membrane chambers (BD Biosciences, no. 353097), either
coated with (for invasion assays) or without (for migration assays) Matrigel (Transwells; BD
Biosciences). The lower chambers contained 0.8 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium/10% fetal bovine serum that served as chemoattractant. For compound treatment,
these were added at the indicated concentrations after cells had been seeded. For DOX
induction of sh4E.389, cells were pretreated with DOX for 2 days, and then plated for
invasion/migration assays, during which time the presence of DOX was maintained. Cells
were allowed to migrate or invade over the course of 24 h. Cells that had not penetrated the
filters were removed by swabbing with cotton swabs. Chambers were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for 20 min, stained in 0.5% crystal violet for 20 min, rinsed with
phosphate-buffered saline after each step, and examined using a bright-field microscope.
Values for invasion and migration were obtained by counting cells in five fields per
membrane (× 20 objective) and are the average of three independent experiments.

point lungs were harvested and assessed for the presence of metastatic lesions. Nude mice
were used as TM15 cells were generated from a mouse of mixed background.
Polysome analysis and quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR

Author Manuscript

For polysome profiling, TM15 cells infected with DOX-inducible shRNAs targeting eIF4E
(sh4E.389) or FLuc (shFLuc.1309) were treated with DOX (2 μg/ml) for 3 days, washed in
phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in hypotonic solution (5 mM Tris-HCl7.5, 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 1.5 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 100
μg/ml cycloheximide). Lysates were loaded onto 10–50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged
in an SW40 rotor at 35 000 r.p.m. for 2 h. Fractions were collected and A260 monitored
using an ISCO UA-6 UV/VIS detector (Teledyne Isco, Lincoln, NE, USA). RNA was
extracted from the fractions using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). The amount of MMP9, VEGF, cyclin D1 and
GAPDH mRNA was determined by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Data analysis
For statistical analysis, unpaired Student t-test with Welch correction was performed using
GraphPad InStat version 3.10 (San Diego, CA, USA).

ectopically induce expression of eIF4E. TRE, Tet-responsive promoter; T2A, Thosea asigna
virus 2A translational cleavage site; IRES, EMCV internal ribosome entry site. (b)
Immunoblot analysis of MDA-MB-468 cells infected with TRE-eIF4E/GFP-PIR vector and
expanded in the presence or absence of DOX. Extracts were prepared and blotted 3 days
after induction of eIF4E expression. (c) Representative crystal violet staining of migrating
MDA-MB-468 cells infected with TRE-eIF4E/GFP-PIR and maintained in the presence or
absence of DOX. (d) Quantitation of cell migration (left panel) and Matrigel invasion (right
panel) of MDA-MB-468 cells infected with TRE-eIF4E/GFP-PIR and maintained in the
presence or absence of DOX. Data represent three independent experiments with five fields
counted per experiment. Bars represent s.e.m. *P = 0.01; **P<0.001.

eIF4E suppression impairs invasion and migration of human breast cancer cells. (a)
Immunoblot analysis of MLP/sh4E.389- and MLP/shFLuc.1309-infected MDA-MB-231
cells (left) and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with either siNT (non-targeting) or siRNAs
against eIF4E (si4E) (right). Quantitation of the relative eIF4E levels is provided below the
blot and is from three independent experiments. (b) Representative crystal violet staining of
migrating MDA-MB-231 cells in which eIF4E was suppressed by RNAi using shRNAs (top)
or siRNAs (bottom). (c, d) Quantitation of cell migration (c) and Matrigel invasion (d) of
MDA-MB-231 cells in which eIF4E was suppressed by RNAi. Data represent three
independent experiments with five fields counted per experiment. Bars represent s.e.m.
*P<0.005. (e) Cell cycle analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells infected with retroviruses
expressing the indicated shRNAs, or transfected with the indicated siRNAs; n = 3; Bars
represent s.e.m. (f, g) MDA-MB-231 cells (106 cells) were injected into the tail vein of 8–
10-week-old nude mice and 2 weeks later treated with vehicle or silvestrol (0.2 mg/kg) daily
for 4 weeks, at which point lungs were harvested. The average metastatic size (f) and
number (g) are presented. *P = 0.05; **P = 0.001.
