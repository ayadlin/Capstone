BACKGROUND: Antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) inhibit the proliferation of various human
cancer cell lines and experimental tumors by mechanisms that include direct action on GHRH receptors in cancer
cells. METHODS: In this study, the effects of newly synthesized GHRH antagonists, MIA-313, MIA-602, MIA-604, and
MIA-610, were investigated in 2 human ovarian epithelial adenocarcinoma cell lines, OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3, in vitro
and in vivo. The expression of receptors for GHRH was demonstrated by Western blot analysis and ligand competition methods in the OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cell lines and in tumors from those cells grown in athymic nude mice. The
effects of GHRH antagonists on the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by OVCAR-3 cells and on
the vascularization of OVCAR-3 xenografts also were evaluated. RESULTS: Both the pituitary and the splice variant
type 1 (SV1) GHRH receptors were detected in the 2 cell lines and in tumor xenografts, and SV1 was expressed at
higher levels. Cell viability assays revealed the antiproliferative effect of all GHRH antagonists that were. Maximal
tumor growth inhibition was approximately 75% in both models. MIA-313 and MIA-602 decreased VEGF secretion of
OVCAR-3 cells, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reduced tumor vascularization in a Matrigel plug assay, but caused no change in the expression of VEGF or VEGF receptor in the terminal ileum of mice with
OVCAR-3 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the current study indicated that a he novel approach based on
GHRH antagonists may offer more effective therapeutic alternatives for patients with advanced ovarian cancer and

Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer among women in the United States, and 22,000 new cases are
diagnosed each year.1 According to the American Cancer Society, epithelial ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate
among gynecologic malignancies, leading to the deaths of 14,000 patients every year in the United States. The majority of
patients are diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecologic Oncologists (FIGO) stage III or IV disease, and
their advanced disease stage at initial diagnosis is the main contributing factor to their overall poor prognosis.2 Despite
aggressive primary therapy and high initial response rates, most women with advanced ovarian carcinoma will relapse and
develop drug-resistant disease.3
After undergoing cytoreductive surgery, patients with metastatic or high-risk early stage disease receive platinumbased and taxane-based chemotherapy.4 However, the 5-year survival rates for patients with FIGO stage III and IV disease
are <40% and 20%, respectively.5 Unfortunately, neither the inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs)
(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER-2]/neu) nor the inhibition of various tyrosine kinases produced a

substantial benefit in patients with ovarian cancer.6-8
Nevertheless, antivascular agents have yielded promising
results in ovarian cancer.9 The administration of bevacizumab, a humanized antibody against vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), has produced higher response
rates in patients with persistent, recurrent, or platinumresistant ovarian carcinoma.10,11 However, possibly
unique to the use of bevacizumab in ovarian cancer
therapy is an alarmingly high rate of gastrointestinal
perforations.12,13
During the past decade, multiple studies by our
group have confirmed that the antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) suppress the growth
of various human cancer cell lines xenografted into nude
mice.14 GHRH has been identified as a growth factor for
epithelial ovarian cancer, and it also has been suggested
that some of GHRH antagonists also may interfere with
tumor VEGF expression.15 In the current study, we evaluated the antiproliferative effects of the newly synthesized
GHRH antagonists MIA-313, MIA-602, MIA-604 and
MIA-610 in the OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 human ovarian
cancer cell lines in vitro and on experimental tumors in
vivo. Previous studies have demonstrated that MIA-602 is
effective in experimental glioblastomas in vivo16 and, in a
certain, rare type of ovarian malignancy (approximately
3%), clear cell carcinoma, in vitro.17 The actions of the
other GHRH antagonists, MIA-313, MIA-604, and
MIA-610, had not yet been tested at the time of that
report. We also investigated whether GHRH antagonists
have a modulatory effect on VEGF secretion by OVCAR3 cells and on the vascularization of OVCAR-3 xenografts
in nude mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and Cancer Xenografts
All experiments were approved by the Veterans Affairs
Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in
accordance with institutional guidelines for the use of experimental animals. Female athymic nude mice (Ncr nu/
nu); ages 5 to 6 weeks were obtained from the National
Institutes of Health (Bethesda, Md). The animals were
housed in laminar air-flow cabinets under pathogen-free
conditions on a 12-hour light/12-hour dark schedule and
were fed autoclaved chow and water ad libitum. Xenografts were initiated by subcutaneous injection of 107
OVCAR-3 and 107 SKOV-3 cells into both flanks of
female nude mice. The developed tumors were dissected
and minced; and 1-mm3 pieces of tumor tissue were
transplanted subcutaneously into both flank areas of the

Peptides and Reagents
GHRH antagonists were synthesized in our laboratory by
using the solid phase method and were purified by
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography

Cell Lines and Culture Conditions
OVCAR-3 (HTB-161) and SKOV-3 (HTB-77) cells
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, Va) are human ovarian epithelial adenocarcinoma cells. Both cell lines were established from malignant ascites in patients with progressive epithelial
adenocarcinoma of the ovary, and the cells are resistant to
doxorubicin and cisplatin. OVCAR-3 cells were grown in
RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 0.01 mg/mL human insulin, and
antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin G and 100 lg/mL streptomycin; Gibco, Grand Island, NY). The SKOV-3 cells
were grown in modified McCoy 5a medium supplemented with 10% FBS and the same antibiotics. Cells
were cultured as a monolayer in a humidified atmosphere
at 37 C and 5% CO2 and were used in the logarithmic
phase of growth.

experimental animals. When the tumors became measurable, control and experimental groups were formed with
animals that had tumors of approximately the same size.
Mice bearing OVCAR-3 tumors were divided into 3
groups (n ¼ 8) and received the following subcutaneous
daily treatment with GHRH antagonists for 7 weeks:
group 1 (control), vehicle solution; group 2, MIA-313
(5 lg); and group 3, MIA-602 (5 lg). Mice bearing
SKOV-3 tumors were assigned to 4 groups (n ¼ 8) and
received the following subcutaneous daily treatment with
GHRH antagonists for 7 weeks: group 1 (control), vehicle
solution; group 2, MIA-313 (5 lg); group 3, MIA-604
(5 lg); and group 4, MIA-610 (5 lg). Tumor size and
body weight were measured every week with microcalipers. Tumor volume was calculated as length  width 
height  0.5236.20 At the end of the experiment, the
tumors were removed under isoflurane anesthesia (Baxter,
Deerfield, Ill) and were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
From mice bearing OVCAR-3 xenografts, 2-cm sections
of the small intestine also were removed and snap-frozen.
All samples were stored at 80 C for further analyses.
Human Nonmalignant Tissues
Normal human pituitaries were purchased from the
National Hormone and Peptide Program (A. F. Parlow,
Los Angeles, County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center,
Torrance, Calif).
Western Blot Analysis
Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and lysed directly in lysis buffer. Proteins from tumor tissues, small intestine samples, and normal human pituitaries were isolated using the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin
kit (Macherey-Nagel Inc., Bethlehem, Pa). The protein
concentrations were determined by NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, Del). Equal amounts
of protein (15-50 lg per lane) were resuspended in 4
times sample loading buffer (0.25 M Trizma Base, 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 40% glycerol, 0.004% bromophenol blue, and 4% b-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) and boiled
for 3 minutes. Proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins from
the gel were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
and were blocked with 50%:50% Odyssey buffer and
Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, the membranes were incubated overnight at
4 C with the following primary antibodies: GHRH-R
polyclonal (1:3000 dilution; AbCam Inc., Cambridge,
Mass), VEGF-R polyclonal (1:250 dilution; Novus Bio-

672

logicals, Littleton, Colo), VEGF-R2 monoclonal
(1:1000dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
Mass), or VEGF monoclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif). After
washing with TBS, the signal for the immunoreactive proteins was developed with infrared IR dye-labeled secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution). The protein bands were
quantified by normalizing the signals of different proteins
to the signal of b-actin (1:10,000 dilution; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and V3.0 software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln,
Neb).
Receptor Binding Assay
The binding characteristics of receptors for GHRH in
membrane fractions of OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cancer
cells were characterized by ligand competition assay based
on the binding of radiolabeled GHRH antagonist,
([125I]JV-1-42).21 The Ligand-PC computerized curvefitting program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
Md) was used to determine the type of receptor binding,
dissociation constant (Kd), and maximal binding capacity
(Bmax) of the receptors.
Cell Proliferation Assay
Cells (105 per well) were seeded onto 96-well plates, cultured overnight, starved for 24 hours in medium without
FBS, and then treated for 48 hours with GHRH antagonists (0.1-10 lM) in medium containing 0.5% FBS. Cell
viability was evaluated by using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfonphenyl)2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous 1 Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega, Madison, Wis)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance
was measured at 490 nm in a Victor 3 Multilabel Counter
(Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Md). All experiments were
done in quadruplicate and were repeated 3 times. The inhibition of cell proliferation was expressed the percentage
of vehicle control (0.1% DMSO in the culture media).
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for
VEGF Expression in Ovarian Cancer Cells
OVCAR-3 cells (2  106 cells per well) were seeded onto
6-well plates, cultured overnight, and then treated for
24 hours with 10 lM MIA-313 or MIA-602 in medium
that contained 2% FBS. Then, the plates were placed on
ice and the medium was removed, and the cells were centrifuged (1000 rpm, 4 C) and stored at 80 C. The cell
numbers were counted in parallel using the MTS assay.

Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed with the Prism 5.0
computer software package (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, Calif). Group comparisons were made by one-way
analyses of variance with the Newman-Keuls post-test.

RESULTS
Figure 1. The expression of pituitary type growth hormonereleasing hormone receptor (pGHRH-R) and the splice variant
type 1 (SV1) receptor for GHRH is revealed by Western blot
analysis in (lane 1) human nonmalignant pituitary (positive
control) cells, (lane 2) OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma cells, and
(lane 3) SKOV-3 ovarian carcinoma cells. The immunoreactive
signals were detected with a polyclonal antibody against a
common sequence present in both pGHRH-R and SV1
receptors.

Concentrations of VEGF protein in the medium were
determined using the Quantikine human VEGF enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kit (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, Minn) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All experiments were done in duplicate and
were repeated 3 times.
In Vivo Angiogenesis (Matrigel Plug) Assay
Female athymic nude mice (Ncr nu/nu;) ages 5 to 6 weeks
were used in these experiments. OVCAR-3 cells were harvested at subconfluence, washed with PBS, resuspended
in serum-free medium and mixed, with Matrigel Matrix
Basement Membrane (Phenol-Red Free; BD Biosciences,
Bedford, Mass; 1:2 volume/volume).22 Under isoflurane
anesthesia, a wide subcutaneous pocket was formed by a
needle, and 3  107 cells were injected into both flanks
of each animal. A week later, the mice were divided randomly into 4 experimental groups (n ¼ 7) and received
the following treatment as subcutaneous injections: group
1 (control), vehicle solution; group 2, a single dose of
100 ng recombinant human (rHu) VEGF (Sigma, St.
Louis, Mo); group 3, MIA-313 5 lg daily; and group 4,
MIA-602 5 lg daily. Treatment with the GHRH antagonists was continued for 2 weeks. In the end, the mice were
anesthetized and killed; and the Matrigel plugs were
carefully dissected, weighed, and placed overnight in icecold PBS at 4 C. The plugs were further digested with
0.03% collagenase (Sigma) at 37 C for 3 hours, stored
overnight at 4 C, centrifuged (at 14,000 revolutions per
minute). Then, the supernatants were collected, and their
hemoglobin concentrations were quantified using the
Quantichrom Hemoglobin Assay Kit (Bioassay Systems,
Hayward, Calif).

The Presence of GHRH Receptors in OVCAR3 and SKOV-3 Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines
In the protein fractions obtained from OVCAR-3 and
SKOV-3 cells and from normal pituitaries, the polyclonal
antibody against a common segment in the pituitary type
GHRH-R (pGHRH-R) and in its truncated splice variant
receptor type 1 (SV1) detected an immunoreactive band
at 39.5 kDa and another at 60 kDa (Fig. 1). Normal
human pituitaries were used as positive controls. The
band at 39.5 kDa is consistent with the receptor protein
encoded by SV1,23 and the 60-kDa band may correspond
to pGHRH-R.16 The SV1 receptor was expressed at a significantly higher level than pGHRH-R in both cell lines.
In the homogenate of the pituitary gland, but not in
the cancer cells, we also observed a broad band between
45 kDa and 48 kDa. SV1 has the highest structural
homology to pGHRH-R and probably is the main SV
that mediates the effects of GHRH and its antagonists on
tumors.
By using (125I)JV-1-42 as a radioligand, a single
class of specific, high-affinity binding sites for GHRH was
detected in the OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cell lines. In the
membranes of OVCAR-3 cells, the Bmax of the binding
sites for GHRH was 207.9  34.5 fmol/mg membrane
protein with a Kd of 4.58  0.18 nM. In the membrane
fractions of SKOV-3 cells, the corresponding Bmax and Kd
values were 335.4  40.5 fmol/mg membrane protein
and 6.55  0.23 nM, respectively.
Inhibition of Cell Proliferation in the OVCAR-3
and SKOV-3 Cell Lines
All the tested GHRH antagonists inhibited the proliferation of OVCAR-3 cells at 5 lM and 10 lM (Fig. 2A).
The effects of the antagonists were similar to each other
on OVCAR-3 cells; therefore, the 2 most effective analogs, MIA-313 and MIA-602, were used in further studies. The proliferation of SKOV-3 cells was inhibited by
all of the tested antagonists at 10 lM, but only MIA-610
was effective at 5 lM (Fig. 2B). Because MIA-602 had
limited effects on SKOV-3 cells, it was not used in the
subsequent in vivo experiments. In addition, 1 lM

Growth Inhibition of Ovarian Tumor
Xenografts
The antitumor effects of the GHRH antagonists MIA313 and MIA-602 were investigated in OVCAR-3 human
ovarian cancers xenografted into athymic nude mice
(Fig. 3A). The effects of MIA-313, MIA-604, and MIA610 were tested on SKOV-3 xenografts. Over the 7-week
treatment, the average volume of OVCAR-3 tumors was
increased by 955.1%  178% in the control group. In
mice that were treated with MIA-313 and MIA-602, the
maximal tumor growth was 250.6%  49% and 218.3%
 55.3%, respectively. Significant inhibition of tumor
growth was observed first after 5 weeks of treatment and

674

peaked at 73.8% with MIA-313 and at 77.1% with MIA602 (P < .05 for both compounds vs control). The maximal tumor growth-inhibiting effects of the tested GHRH
antagonists did not differ between MIA-313 and MIA602 (P > .05).
In mice bearing SKOV-3 tumors (Fig. 3B), the
maximal tumor growth was 1273%  278.8% in the
control group. From the third week on, treatment with
MIA-313, MIA-604, or MIA-610 revealed significant
inhibitions of tumor growth compared with the control
group (P < .001 vs control for all compounds). In the
groups that were treated with MIA-313, MIA-604, and
MIA-610, the maximal tumor growth was 328.6% 
51.8%, 360.9%  72.2%, and 383.9%  73.2%,
respectively, indicating an inhibition of 74.2%, 71.6%
and 69.8%, respectively.

we detected a 39.5-kDa band and a 60-kDa band
corresponding to the SV1 receptor and the pGHRH-R,
respectively (Fig. 4A,B). In all tumor samples, the SV1
receptor was expressed at a higher level (P < .01) than the
pGHRH-R. In the intestine samples from the same animals (Fig. 4C,D), pGHRH-R expression was similar to
that in the tumors (P < .05), but SV1 expression was
lower than that in the tumors (P < .01); that is, SV1
receptors were more abundant in tumor tissues. In
OVCAR-3 tumors, MIA-313 decreased pGHRH-R
and SV1 expression (P < .01 for both), whereas MIA-602
reduced only pGHRH-R levels (P < .01). In small
intestine samples, MIA-313 decreased pGHRH-R expression (P < .01) but not SV1expression. Neither pGHRHR levels nor SV1 levels in the intestine were changed by
MIA-602.
Similarly, in SKOV-3 tumors, SV1 was more abundant (P < .01) than pGHRH-R (Fig. 5A,B). pGHRH-R
expression did not change after treatment with GHRH
antagonists. However, SV1 receptor levels were decreased
in the MIA-604 group and were increased in the MIA610 group.

xenografts or (B) SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer xenografts

are the mean  standard error of the mean. One star indicates P < .05; 2 stars, P < .01; 3 stars, P < .001 versus control.

There were no significant differences between the
maximal tumor growth-inhibiting effects of the tested
GHRH antagonists in either model (P > .05). No differences were observed in the body weights of animals that
received various treatments versus controls.

Expression of VEGF and VEGF Receptors in
OVCAR-3 Tumor Xenografts and Intestine
Samples
The expression of human VEGF and its receptors,
VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2, on OVCAR-3 xenografts and
on small intestine samples of OVCAR-3 tumor-bearing
animals also was investigated by Western blot analysis.
Our results indicated that treatment with MIA-313 or

In the small intestine samples that we tested, MIA-313
and MIA-602 slightly decreased VEGF levels
(Fig. 6C,D), but the decrease was not significant. The polyclonal antibody we used for VEGF receptors recognizes
VEGF-R1 (Flt1) and VEGF-R2 (Flk1 or kinase insertdomain receptor). In tumors, the polyclonal antibody
detected a band only at approximately 200 to220 kDa

220 kDa, corresponding to the VEGF-R2. This indicates
that the OVCAR-3 xenografts expressed VEGF-R2 type
receptors only. The treatment with GHRH antagonists
did not change VEGF-R2 expression in the tumors. No
band was observed in the small intestine samples probed
with either the polyclonal (not shown) or the monoclonal
VEGF-R2 antibody. The only immunoreactivity observed
in the Western blot analysis was that of the positive control
(control tumor) sample.

In Vivo Vascularization of Tumor Xenografts
Tumorigenesis induced the formation of vessels in the
Matrigel plug. In the control group, the hemoglobin content of the plugs was 14.80  2.89 mg/dL (Fig. 7). In
mice that received a single dose of 100 ng rHu VEGF, the
hemoglobin content of the plugs was 21.21  1.53 mg/
dL, indicating enhanced angiogenesis. In mice that
received MIA-313 or MIA-602, the hemoglobin content
of the plugs decreased to 11.35  0.6 mg/dL (P < .05 vs

676

control) and 11.76  0.36 mg/dL (P < .05 vs control),
respectively.

DISCUSSION
GHRH antagonists were developed in our laboratory to
provide targeted antitumor action and to minimize the
side effects associated with conventional cytotoxic drugs.
Over the past decade, we have documented the ability of
these GHRH antagonists to inhibit the growth, tumorigenicity, and metastases of a wide range of human experimental malignancies. Their mechanisms of action include
suppression of the pituitary-hepatic growth hormone–insulin-like growth factor I (GH-IGF-I) axis, the inhibition
of autocrine and/or paracrine production of IGF-I and
IGF-II in tumors, and blockage of the direct stimulatory
action of local GHRH on tumors. Previous studies by our
group demonstrated that the GHRH antagonists JV-1-36
and MZ-5-156, at a dose of 20 lg daily, effectively inhibited growth of the human ovarian epithelial carcinoma
cell lines OV-1063 and UCI-107 xenografted into nude

mice.24,25 Surgical specimens of human ovarian cancer
contained GHRH mRNA, suggesting a local, autocrine,
and/or paracrine role of GHRH in the proliferation of
ovarian cancer cells.26
Our current findings demonstrate that the novel
GHRH antagonists synthesized in our laboratory exert
more potent antitumor effects in experimental ovarian
cancers than our previous analogs. New analogs tested at a
dose of only 5 lg daily inhibited the growth of OVCAR-3
and SKOV-3 xenografts in nude mice by 70% and 77%,
respectively. Through the 7-week treatment, their antitumor effects were not accompanied by weight loss or macroscopic changes of the heart, liver, spleen, intestines, or
kidneys of tested animals, suggesting that these new
GHRH antagonists probably are not toxic.
The GHRH antagonists used in our in vivo experiments were selected based on their in vitro antiproliferative effect. Because all tested antagonists had a similar

Cancer

effect on OVCAR-3 cells, we chose MIA-313 and MIA602 for in vivo testing. The in vivo antitumor effect of
MIA-313 and MIA-602 on OVCAR-3 xenografts was
very similar to that observed in vitro. In SKOV-3 cells,
the effects of MIA-313, MIA-604, and MIA-610 were
considerably better than those of MIA-602, so the latter
was not included in the testing in vivo. It is noteworthy
that the effects of MIA-313 and MIA-604 on SKOV-3
xenografts greatly exceeded their in vitro effects.
The GHRH antagonists exert their antiproliferative
effect mainly by blocking tumor GHRH receptors and
inhibiting growth. By using (125I)JV-1-42, we identified
the presence of specific, high-affinity receptors for
GHRH in both human ovarian cancer cell lines that we
investigated. In addition, we have demonstrated for
the first time the presence of both pGHRH-R and SV1
receptors on OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells using Western
blot analysis.
Our results revealed intense SV1 expression and less
marked pGHRH-R expression in both cell lines tested. It
appears that SV1 is the predominant type of GHRH-R on
certain cancer cells or tumors and functions as the main
therapeutic target for the anticancer effect of GHRH
antagonists.14,27 In contrast, the human pituitary
expresses mostly the pGHRH-R, which may be glycosylated to a different extent. SV1 is the truncated form of
GHRH-R and lacks the first 151 amino acids of the
pGHRH-R,28 a region of potential glycosylation sites.
The glycosylated forms of pGHRH-R between 40 kDa
and 60 kDa were observed as bands in blots of pituitary
extract and tumor xenografts.
Similar high expression of SV1 and low expression
of pGHRH-R was observed in both OVCAR-3 and
SKOV-3 xenografts. Treatment with the GHRH antagonists for 7 weeks did not up-regulate the expression of
pGHRH-R in OVCAR-3 or SKOV-3 xenografts. However, MIA-604 somewhat decreased SV1 expression and
MIA-610 increased SV1 expression in SKOV-3 tumors.
We presume that the up-regulation of SV1 by MIA-610 is
related to its prominent antiproliferative effect. Ligands
with a strong or long-acting antagonistic effect may cause
up-regulation of the target protein to counterbalance the
antagonistic effect. Nevertheless, the difference between
the effect of MIA-610 and other analogs on the up-regulation SV1 is not clearly understood, because all of the analogs in this class that were used in the current study were
powerful antagonists of GHRH.
We also determined GHRH-R expression in the terminal ileum of OVCAR-3 tumor-bearing mice.

Figure 6. Representative Western blots are shown for human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR2) in (A) OVCAR-3 human ovarian xenografts and (C) small intestine samples from mice bearing OVCAR-3 xenografts (þ indicates a tumor sample that was used as a positive control). The immunoreactive signals for VEGF-R2 observed here were
detected with a monoclonal antibody specific for VEGF-R2. Expression levels of proteins were compared after standardization to
the expression of b-actin in (B) OVCAR-3 tumors and (D) small intestine samples versus control (ctrl). Three representative
tumors from each group are shown, and each experiment was repeated 3 times. Values indicated are the mean  standard error

Figure 7. This chart illustrates the effects of recombinant
human vascular endothelial growth factor (rHu VEGF), MIA313, and MIA-602 on the vascularization of Matrigel plugs in
mice bearing OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer xenografts.
OVCAR-3 cells were mixed with Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into both flanks of female nude mice. rHu VEGF
was given in a single dose of 100 ng; MIA-313 and MIA-602
were given at 5 lg daily for 2 weeks. At the end of the
experiment, the mice were killed, the plugs were removed
and dissolved, and their hemoglobin concentrations were
quantified. Values indicated are the mean  standard error of
the mean. A star indicates P < .05 versus control.

According to previous studies, the monoclonal antibody
for VEGF, bevacizumab, has produced promising antitumor effects but also has resulted in severe gastrointestinal
perforations specifically related to ovarian cancers.12 The

678

mechanism by which bevacizumab contributes to gastrointestinal perforations is elusive, although it may result
from impaired bowel perfusion and/or regression of
unrecognized bowel tumor implants.29 Therefore, in the
current work, we intended to study the possible antivascular effects of our newly synthesized GHRH antagonists
that enable us to avoid this complication in anticancer
therapy. The relatively low level of GHRH-R observed
in the ileum and the dominance of the pGHRH-R type
represented a major difference from tumor tissue. The
moderate expression of GHRH-R in this particular part
of the intestine suggests that GHRH does not play a
dominant role there as a growth-promoting factor; thus,
GHRH antagonists should not be detrimental.
The anti-VEGF effect of MIA-313 and MIA-602
also was investigated, and our results confirmed that
MIA-313 markedly inhibited the VEGF secretion of
OVCAR-3 cells. Meanwhile, no change was observed in
tumor VEGF or VEGR-R2 expression in OVCAR-3 xenografts over the course of treatment with GHRH antagonists. VEGF is a potent but not unique angiogenic factor,
and it can induce cell proliferation and migration through
VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2. Previous studies by our group
demonstrated that tumor VEGF concentrations remained

unchanged or slightly decreased by GHRH antagonist
treatment.14,15 The lack of a dramatic decrease does not
mean that tumor VEGF secretion is insensitive to GHRH
antagonists. In addition to ovarian carcinoma cells, the
newly formed vascular endothelial cells and stromal cells
are other important sources of VEGF. Their VEGF secretion may mask the inhibition of GHRH-dependent
VEGF secretion by tumor cells.
We carried out an additional study to assess more
comprehensively the effects of GHRH antagonists on tumor vasculature. In an established Matrigel plug assay,
rHu VEGF used as a positive control enhanced angiogenesis, as expected. MIA-313 and MIA-602 reduced vessel
formation in the OVCAR-3 tumors, which is direct evidence for the inhibition of in vivo angiogenesis by
GHRH antagonists, as demonstrated for the first time (to
our knowledge) on these experimental tumor xenografts.
With regard to VEGF signaling in the terminal
ileum samples from mice with OVCAR-3 tumors, we
detected no change in their VEGF content after treatments with GHRH antagonists. The lack of an immunoreactive band for VEGF-R1 was surprising; however,
other investigators also reported low immunoreaction for
VEGF-R1 in the ileum of mice and rats, possibly related
to a lower cell renewal rate in this portion of the intestine.30 We assume that VEGF-R1 in our samples was
under the detection limits. It is suspected that the other
subtype, VEGF-R2, is consistently nonreactive in normal
intestinal tissue.31 After all, the GHRH antagonists used
in our experiments did not cause any apparent change in
the VEGF/VEGF-R pathway in the tested terminal ileum
sections from tumor-bearing mice.
Our results demonstrate that new, potent antagonists of GHRH receptors inhibit the growth of human
experimental ovarian cancers. The GHRH antagonists
tested seem to be devoid of major adverse effect. However,
only a systematic evaluation of the effect of these antagonists in a clinical setting can reveal whether they offer a
distinct advantage over other classes of antitumor agents.
Because GHRH antagonists operate on different pharmacologic principles, they also could be combined with
standard chemotherapeutic agents for an enhanced antitumor effect.32 It appears to be promising that the 2 antagonists tested, MIA-313 and MIA-602, even reduced tumor
vascularization without affecting VEGF signaling in the
terminal ileum. This novel therapeutic approach based on
GHRH antagonists may offer therapeutic alternatives for
patients with advanced ovarian cancer who do not tolerate
conventional anti-VEGF therapy. In the near future, the

ability to choose appropriate strategies for individual
patients with ovarian cancer hopefully will improve treatment and extend patient survival.
