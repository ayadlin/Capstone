Abstract
Early therapeutic efficacy of anti–death receptor 5 antibody
(TRA-8) combined with gemcitabine was measured using
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in an
orthotopic pancreatic tumor model. Groups 1 to 4 of severe
combined immunodeficient mice (n = 5–7 per group) bearing
orthotopically implanted, luciferase-positive human pancreatic tumors (MIA PaCa-2) were subsequently (4–5 weeks
thereafter) injected with saline (control), gemcitabine
(120 mg/kg), TRA-8 (200 Mg), or TRA-8 combined with
gemcitabine, respectively, on day 0. DWI, anatomic magnetic
resonance imaging, and bioluminescence imaging were done
on days 0, 1, 2, and 3 after treatment. Three tumors from each
group were collected randomly on day 3 after imaging, and
terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling staining was done to quantify apoptotic
cellularity. At just 1 day after starting therapy, the changes of
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in tumor regions for
group 3 (TRA-8) and group 4 (TRA-8/Gem) were 21 F 9%
(mean F SE) and 27 F 3%, respectively, significantly higher (P
< 0.05) than those of group 1 (1 F 5%) and group 2 (2 F
4%). There was no statistical difference in tumor volumes for
the groups at this time. The mean ADC values of groups 2 to 4
gradually increased over 3 days, which were concurrent with
tumor volume regressions and bioluminescence signal
decreases. Apoptotic cell densities of tumors in groups 1 to
4 were 0.7 F 0.4%, 0.6 F 0.2%, 3.1 F 0.9%, and 4.7 F 1.0%,
respectively, linearly proportional to the ADC changes on day
1. Further, the ADC changes were highly correlated with the
previously reported mean survival times of animals treated
with the same agents and doses. This study supports the
clinical use of DWI for pancreatic tumor patients for early
assessment of drug efficacy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8369–76]

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer has the highest fatality rate of all cancers and
is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States in
2007.8 The efficacies of current drugs such as 5-fluorouracil,

irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and gemcitabine are modest in most
pancreatic cancer patients (1–5). A therapeutic approach that
selectively kills pancreatic cancer would be highly advantageous
and may be possible by targeting death receptors expressed on
pancreatic tumor cells (6, 7). Tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in most
tumor cell lines (8–11) via death receptor 4 and death receptor 5
(12–15). Of concern, the significant cytotoxicity of TRAIL in human
hepatocytes may limit its clinical application (16). The hepatoxicity
of TRAIL may be related to binding to multiple receptors (17–20);
the limitation could be overcome by using an agonistic antibody
targeting only one death receptor.
A novel murine, monomeric monoclonal antibody (TRA-8) was
developed specifically to target death receptor 5, predominantly
expressed in most cancer cells but not in normal cells (21). The
antitumor efficacy of TRA-8 in five pancreatic cancer cell lines has
been measured by in vitro cytotoxicity assay; each cell line had a
unique sensitivity for TRA-8 (22). Pancreatic tumor cell resistance
might be reduced by exposure to additional drugs and/or radiation,
which destabilizes the mitochondrial membrane and subsequently
releases cytochrome c, leading to the activation of caspase-3
(23, 24). Although combination therapy might be superior to
monotherapy, a certain range of therapeutic efficacy is predicted in
patients with genetically heterogeneous tumors. Therefore, it would
be ideal to determine the degree of tumor response in each
individual patient following treatment, and then to adjust
therapeutic strategy at the earliest possible time in efforts to
improve survival.
Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) has
successfully been applied in various cancers to evaluate early
response against effective therapy (25–27) and has been positively
correlated with eventual clinical outcome (28). In the early stage of
apoptosis, water in the extracellular space is increased due to
apoptotic volume decrease. This quantitative change in water can
be measured as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), depicted
on DWI with high sensitivity, before visible change of tumor
morphology and size. Early assessment of response should enable
application of appropriate agents during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy will result in a decrease
of primary tumor size to facilitate surgical tumor removal as well
as to prevent potential metastasis.

Cancer Research

The aim of this study was to develop a DWI protocol to detect
early therapeutic response following treatment with TRA-8 combined with gemcitabine in a mouse model of orthotopic pancreatic
tumor, and to correlate the early ADC change with animal survival
time. In addition, living tumor mass was monitored by bioluminescence imaging to confirm the killing efficacy by the combined
therapy while, simultaneously, the tumor volumes were measured
using standard anatomic magnetic resonance imaging; both
parameters were compared with the ADC values from repeated
DWI. The results show that noninvasive imaging parameters
developed in this study accurately reflected the efficacy of the novel
combined therapy in pancreatic cancer, and thus may be readily
translated to a clinical trial.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell lines. All reagents were from Fisher unless otherwise
specified. The human pancreatic cell line MIA PaCa-2 was a gift from
Dr. M. Hollingsworth (University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE). MIA PaCa-2 cells
were cultured in DMEM (Mediatech, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone). Luciferase-positive MiaPaCa-2 cells were created using the
ViraPort retroviral vector, which does not require antibiotics for selection
(Stratagene). After viral infection, MiaPaCa-2 cells were diluted to single
cells to produce a stable luciferase-positive clone. Single colonies were
screened based on luminescence signal obtained with the IVIS-100 system.
The luciferase-positive Mia PaCa-2 clone was allowed to proliferate,
resulting in the cells used for this study. All MIA PaCa-2 cells reported in
this publication were luciferase positive but denoted as only MIA PaCa-2.
Luciferin was purchased from Xenogen, Inc. Purified TRA-8 (mouse origin)
was provided by Daiichi Sankyo (Tokyo, Japan). Gemcitabine (Eli Lilly and
Company) was purchased from the University of Alabama at Birmingham
Hospital Pharmacy. Purified mouse IgG1 K isotype control antibody was
purchased from SouthernBiotech. Fresh Tc-99m pertechnetate was
purchased from Birmingham Nuclear Pharmacy.
HYNIC conjugation and radiolabeling. A fresh 1.8 mmol/L solution of
succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate (HYNIC; courtesy of Dr. Gary Bridger,
AnorMED, Inc., Langley, British Columbia, Canada) in dimethylformamide
was prepared. Forty picomoles were transferred to glass vials, followed by
freezing at 90jC, and then the solutions were vacuum dried using
Advantage Benchtop Freeze Dryer (Virtis Co., Inc.) with the shelf
temperature at 75jC and trap at 90jC. The vials were sealed under
vacuum and kept frozen at 80jC until use. Each vial was reconstituted
with 1.0 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (0.15 mol/L, pH 7.8) containing
1 mg of TRA-8 (HYNIC/TRA-8 molar ratio of 6; ref. 29). After a
3-h incubation at room temperature, the mixture was transferred to
Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette having 10,000 molecular weight cutoff
(Pierce) and then immersed in 1,000 mL PBS (pH 7.4) overnight at 4jC.
The HYNIC-modified TRA-8 was labeled with Tc-99m using SnCl2/tricine as
the transfer ligand (30), and unbound Tc-99m was removed by G-25
Sephadex size-exclusion chromatography. The radiolabeling yield was
f60%. Protein concentrations of the collected fractions were measured
by Lowry assay (31). The level of Tc-99m binding to TRA-8 was always >96%,

as measured by TLC using separate strips eluted with saturated saline and
methyl ethyl ketone.
Animal preparation. Animal experiments were reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Seven groups of
female severe combined immunodeficient mice (National Cancer InstituteFrederick Animal Production Program; 4–5 wk old; n = 5 for groups 1 to 3, 6,
and 7; n = 7 for group 4; n = 3 for group 5) were used. The procedure for
intrapancreatic tumor implantation was as follows: a 1-cm incision was
made in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, and a solution of 2.5  106
MIA PaCa-2 cells in 40 AL of DMEM was injected into the tail of the
pancreas, whereas the mice were anesthetized using i.p. injection of
xylazine and ketamine. The skin and peritoneum was closed in one layer
with three interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures. Four weeks after tumor
implantation, abdominal ultrasound imaging was done as described below
to select mice with matched tumor size for groups 1 to 5. DWI, anatomic
magnetic resonance imaging, and bioluminescence imaging were done for
groups 1 to 4 on days 0, 1, 2, and 3, at 4 to 5 wk after tumor cell
implantation; groups 1 to 4 were injected with i.v. saline (200 AL), i.p.
gemcitabine (120 mg/kg), i.v. TRA-8 (200 Ag), and i.v. TRA-8 (200 Ag)
combined with i.p. gemcitabine (120 mg/kg), respectively, on day 0 after
imaging. TRA-8 and gemcitabine were injected mixed with 200 AL of saline.
DWI and anatomic magnetic resonance imaging were also done on group 5,
a second control group injected with i.v. saline (200 AL), on days 0, 3, and 6.
The mean tumor sizes of the groups 1 to 5 were not statistically different at
the beginning of therapy. All mice in groups 1 to 4 were sacrificed after
imaging on day 3, and histologic analysis [terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining] for tumors
was followed. To assess distribution of TRA-8, animals in groups 6 and 7
were i.v. injected with Tc-99m–labeled TRA-8 (4.4 MBq, 9 Ag) and Tc-99m–
labeled isotype control antibody (3.2 MBq, 10 Ag), respectively; single
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and X-ray computed
tomography (CT) were applied at 6 h after injection, followed by
biodistribution study at 24 h after injection. The mean tumor weights of
the groups 6 and 7 were not statistically different. All animals were
anesthetized using isoflurane gas (1–2%) during imaging.
Magnetic resonance imaging. Small animal DWI was done on a Bruker
BioSpec 9.4T system (Bruker BioSpin Corp.). The animal was placed on an
animal bed equipped with circulating warm water to regulate body
temperature during magnetic resonance imaging scans. An orthogonally
bent plastic board was used to prevent the transfer of the respiratory
motion in chest to abdominal area, as shown in Fig. 1. DWI data were
collected using a standard spin echo sequence with two b-factors (5 and
1,000 s/mm2) at three orthogonal gradient directions (x, y, z) because no
significant difference between ADC values obtained with two b factors and
those with six b factors was measured in previously reported DWI study on
glioma (28). The acquisition parameters are as follows: repetition time (TR)/
echo time (TE), 2,500/32 ms; diffusion separation time, 16 ms; diffusion
gradient duration, 6 ms; 128  128 matrix; and a 30  30-mm field of view.
A total of three to five 1-mm-thick slices (0.2-mm gap) were used to cover
tumor regions of interest. Tumor was imaged using a combination of a 1H
volume resonator/transmitter and a surface coil receiver (Bruker BioSpin).
A magnetic resonance–compatible small animal respiratory gating device
(SA Instrument, Inc.) was used during the scans. A test tube filled with 70%

ethanol was placed on the animal’s skin adjacent to the tumor and imaged
concurrently, so that ADC values in the tumor regions were adjusted using
the mean ADC value of the standard in efforts to correct ADC
quantification error due to body temperature fluctuation (32) or systemic
error from the imager.
While the animal was under anesthesia, anatomic magnetic resonance
imaging to measure tumor volume was done using a T2-weighted spin echo
sequence (RARE) with the following acquisition parameters: repetition time
(TR)/echo time (TE), 2,000/48.8 ms; 128  128 matrix; and a 30  30-mm
field of view. Continuous 1-mm thick slices were used to cover the entire
tumor region. Total acquisition time for DWI and anatomic magnetic
resonance imaging was f35 min.
The tumor area was segmented from images obtained with the smaller
b factor, based on the signal intensity between the region of interest and
background. The ADC value of each pixel of the segmented tumor region
was calculated as follows: ADC = ln(I 1/I 2)/(b 2/b 1), where I 1 was the
intensity on the pixel with b 1, and I 2 was that with b 2. The final ADC map
was obtained by averaging three ADC maps in three orthogonal directions
to acquire orientation-independent ADC values. The segmentation and
quantification of 70% ethanol used as the standard were implemented with
the same procedure. The final ADC value of a tumor was obtained by
averaging all ADC values in the whole tumor region. Tumor volume was
measured by summing all voxels inside of the tumor boundary of the
anatomic magnetic resonance images. Segmentation of the tumor volume
was done using ImageJ version 1.37v (NIH). The ADC quantification and
finding best-fitting curves for ADC changes (described in result session)
were implemented using computer software developed with Labview
version 8.5 (National Instruments Co.).
Ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound imaging was done using a VisualSonics
VEVO 660 high-frequency, high-resolution ultrasound instrument with a

40-MHz probe. Animals were placed in the supine position for examination
with B-Mode imaging (33). The largest diameter was found in the anteriorposterior plane, and this diameter and a transverse diameter were
measured to quantify tumor area (length  width).
SPECT/CT imaging. SPECT/CT imaging was done using a SPECT/CT
dual-modality imager (X-SPECT, Gamma Medica-Ideas). In SPECT imaging,
a total of 64 projections (data matrix size, 5656 per projection) were
acquired with a 50-s acquisition time per projection using a pinhole
collimator with a 1-mm tungsten pinhole insert. The field of view was
43.8 mm, whereas the radius of rotation was 32 mm. Images were
reconstructed using an ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm (8 subsets and 20 iterations). The fourth-order Butterworth digital
filtrations (fc, 0.25; fm, 0.15) provided by the vendor software were applied
for all SPECT images to enhance the image quality. For the CT system,
the X-ray tube was operated at a voltage of 50 kVp and an anode current of
0.6 mA. Two hundred fifty-six projections were acquired to obtain the CT
images, and acquisition time per projection was 0.5 s. The coregistration of
SPECT and CT images was done using computer software, IDL Virtual
Machine (Research System, Inc.). A 60-W heat lamp warmed the bodies of
the animals while they were under anesthesia. A consistent color scale was
applied to all SPECT images after correction for radioactive decay and dose.
Biodistribution study. Tumor, liver, and blood were collected for each
animal; those samples were weighed and the Tc-99m activity was measured
using a calibrated gamma-ray counter (MINAXIg Auto-gamma 5000 Series
Gamma Counter, Packard Instrument Company), decay corrected to dosing
time, and converted to absolute radioactivity; then the percent of injected
dose per gram of each tissue (%ID/g) was determined.
Bioluminescence imaging. Bioluminescence imaging was applied to all
mice after magnetic resonance imaging on each day using the IVIS-100
imaging system (Xenogen). Each mouse was i.p. injected with luciferin at a

dose of 2.5 mg (0.1 mL) and imaged after 15 min on a temperaturecontrolled warm bed (37jC) with the following imaging parameters: 5- to
10-s luminescent exposure time, 8 photographic binning, 25-cm axial field of
view, and 1 f-stop. The region of interest was drawn manually around the
tumor area, and the light emitted from the region of interest was measured
using the vendor software. Mice were imaged weekly before selection by
bioluminescence and ultrasonography for inclusion in the therapy study.
Mice with diffuse bioluminescence signal in the peritoneal cavity (leakage
from implantation site, f15% of implantations) were excluded from further
study. Mice with nonspherical tumors as determined by ultrasonography
were also excluded from further study.
Histologic analysis. Three tumors from each group were selected
randomly after sacrificing the animals, and TUNEL staining of each tumor
tissue was done. Detailed tumor tissue staining procedure is presented in
Appendix 1. Two digital pictures (250) were taken away from areas of
necrosis but otherwise randomly for each tumor slice by one investigator
blinded to the treatments that each animal had received, using SPOT
camera on a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope (Nikon, Inc.), interfaced with a
personal computer and SPOT software. The image analysis software was
ImageJ version 1.37v (NIH). The apoptotic (TUNEL) cells were segmented by
the signal intensity difference between the target cells and background in
each picture, whereas the intensity and minimum particle size thresholds
were determined manually and then counted in all the two pictures per
tumor. The number of total tumor cells was also counted with the same
procedure, and the cell density (apoptotic cell number / total tumor cell
number) was calculated. Uneven background intensity was corrected using
the ‘‘rolling ball’’ algorithm (34), whereas the radius was manually
determined.
Statistical analysis. One-way ANOVA (35) was carried out using SAS
version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Inc.) to compare the averaged ADC, bioluminescence, and tumor volume changes in mice without treatment to those
treated with TRA-8, gemcitabine, and TRA-8 combined with gemcitabine.
ANOVA was also applied to compare the results of TUNEL staining in
tumors of mice in the four different groups.

Results
SPECT imaging and biodistribution analysis confirmed the
specific uptake of Tc-99m–labeled TRA-8 into orthotopic
pancreatic tumor xenografts. Figure 2 shows a photograph of a
representative mouse bearing an orthotopic pancreatic tumor
(Fig. 2A) and SPECT/CT fused images (coronal view) at 6 hours
after injection of Tc-99m-TRA-8 (Fig. 2B) or Tc-99m-isotype control
antibody (Fig. 2C) in another mouse with the same color scaling.
The dotted circle in each subfigure indicates the tumor region.
There was higher tumor uptake of Tc-99m-TRA-8 as compared with
the Tc-99m-isotype control antibody. From the biodistribution
study, the %ID/g in tumor, liver, and blood at 24 hours after Tc99m-TRA-8 injection was 20.0 F 2.2, 11.0 F 0.6, and 12.9 F 1.7,
respectively, whereas those tissues for mice injected with Tc-99misotype control antibody were 9.4 F 1.8, 12.5 F 0.7, and 14.7 F 0.8,
respectively. The tumor uptake of Tc-99m-TRA-8 was significantly
(P < 0.05) higher than that of the Tc-99m–labeled isotype control
antibody.
A significant ADC increase was detected by DWI at 1 day
after combined therapy or TRA-8 monotherapy. Figure 3 shows
a representative set of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
images at b = 5 s/mm2 (Fig. 3A) and b = 1,000 s/mm2 (Fig. 3B) with
the same gray scaling and the ADC map calculated from both the
images (Fig. 3C). The tube filled with 70% ethanol (standard for
ADC quantification) and the tumor regions are indicated with

ADC increases for group 4 on all the 3 days of measurement were
higher than those of group 3, but the differences were not
significant statistically (P > 0.05). The mean ADC change of group 2
gradually increased and reached 12 F 9% on day 3, which was
statistically different (P < 0.05) than that of group 1. Of interest, the
ADC values of group 1 (control) gradually decreased over time,
which was confirmed in a repeat experiment (group 5); the mean
ADC changes of group 5 (control) were 12 F 4% and 26 F 6% at
3 and 6 days after treatment, respectively.
Tumor volume and bioluminescence signal changes for groups 1
to 4 are presented in Fig. 4B and C, respectively. Tumor volume
changes were not statistically different among any of the groups on
day 1, but the mean values for groups 3 and 4 were significantly
lower (P < 0.05) than those of groups 1 and 2 on days 2 and 3.
Whereas the mean tumor volume of group 2 remained constant,
that of group 1 increased 18 F 14% during the 3-day monitoring
period. The tumor volume changes of group 5 (control) were 10 F
11% and 6 F 11% on days 3 and 6, respectively. Mean
bioluminescence signal changes of both groups 1 and 2 increased
f250% during the 3 days, whereas those of groups 3 and 4

decreased 89 F 2% and 88 F 2%, respectively, during the same
time period, comparable with tumor volume decreases of group 3
(69 F 5%) and group 4 (74 F 6%).
Early ADC increase was highly correlated with apoptotic
cellularity. Figure 5A shows representative photomicrographs of
tumor slices (5-Am thickness) following TUNEL staining. Quantifications of apoptotic cell density of groups 1 to 4 are represented
in histograms (Fig. 5B). The apoptotic cell densities of groups 3
and 4 were significantly higher than those of the other groups,
indicating the superior therapeutic efficacy of TRA-8. Figure 5C
shows that the mean apoptotic cell density was linearly
proportional to the mean ADC increase measured at 1 day after
therapy initiation (shown in Fig. 4A).
Early ADC increase was highly correlated with survival time.
Figure 6A shows the ADC changes at 1 day after treatment were
linearly proportional to the mean survival time, measured in our
previous study (22); the mean survival times were 76 F 3 (mean F
SE), 79 F 5, 121 F 4, and 142 F 7 days, when mice were untreated
(control) or treated with two cycles of gemcitabine, TRA-8, and
TRA-8 plus gemcitabine, respectively, with the same doses used for

the current study. From Fig. 6A, an equation to correlate the early
ADC changes and survival times was derived as follows,
EST ¼ 2:89ADC1D þ 5:26  3ADC1D ;

ðAÞ

where EST is extended survival time (%) by treatment and ADC1D is
ADC change (%) at 1 day after therapy initiation. However, one
major concern in the application of ADC measurement for early
therapy evaluation would be that the water induced by tumor cell
killing may not be confined within the tumor boundary but may
diffuse away. As more water is generated, a higher oncotic pressure
may result, causing an even faster diffusion. Therefore, the
prognosis based on Eq. A might be varied according to the
imaging time point after starting therapy.
A new, DWI-based imaging biomarker to measure therapeutic efficacy independently from imaging time point was
proposed. Figure 4A shows that the amount of ADC increase for
group 4 was decreased on each subsequent day after therapy was
initiated. If the amount of extracellular water induced by apoptosis
were in equilibrium with the water that was diffusing out from the
tumor, then the magnitude of ADC increase relative to the baseline
value would be constant. Therefore, the ADC increase over time
could be modeled by
ADCn ¼ ð1  en Þ;

ðBÞ

where n is time (day); ADCn is ADC change (%) relative to day 0 at
n day after therapy initiation; a is the maximum ADC increase (%);
and b is a constant to determine the change rate of ADC increase
over time. From the best-fitting curve to the ADC changes of group
4, a was estimated to be 37%. Figure 6B presents four best-fit
curves for the average ADC changes in groups 1 to 4, when a was
fixed to 37%. The b values were 0.113, 0.096, 0.634, and 1.224 for
groups 1 to 4, respectively. Figure 6C shows that the b values were
linearly proportional to the mean survival time, and therefore Eq. A
can be rewritten to correlate the b values with survival times as
follows:
EST ¼ 69:7 þ 5:26  70:

ðCÞ

In summary, the b value obtained from multiple DWI studies could
be considered as a new imaging biomarker.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the application of
DWI in an orthotopic pancreatic tumor model. Further, this study
shows the feasibility of DWI for early detection of effective therapy
of an apoptosis-inducing drug for pancreatic cancer treatment. To
date, DWI of orthotopic pancreatic tumor has had limited success
due to severe respiratory motion artifact in the abdominal area. To
prevent motion transfer from the chest region, each tumor was
secured using an orthogonally bent plastic board (Fig. 1). The
pressure applied by this board was localized on the abdominal area
and did not result in respiratory difficulty or mortality of the
animals. No injury or death occurred in the 98 imaging sessions,
although each imaging session required f1 hour including
preparation time. Importantly, most diffusion-weighted magnetic
resonance images at even high b values had minor motion artifact,
facilitating reproducible ADC quantification. Furthermore, highfrequency ultrasound imaging was used to select mice bearing
identical tumor sizes throughout the groups, increasing the

Figure 6. Correlation between early ADC change and survival time. A, mean
survival times [from Derosier et al. (22)] versus ADC increases at 1 d after
therapy (shown in Fig. 4A ). The mean survival times were measured in
previous experiment when four groups (n = 10 per group) of severe combined
immunodeficient mice bearing MIA PaCa-2 tumors orthotopically were
untreated (control) or treated with two cycles consisting of multiple injections
of gemcitabine, TRA-8, and TRA-8 combined with gemcitabine. The dose
fraction for each group was the same with that in the current study. B, mean ADC
changes of four groups (shown in Fig. 4A) for 3 d after therapy initiation and
best-fitting nonlinear curves (Eq. B) with four different b values. C, mean
survival times versus the curve constants (b).

accuracy of ADC quantification. In a previous experiment, variable
tumor growth was observed in the same orthotopic pancreatic
tumor model (22, 36). Larger tumors may contain central necrosis
(37, 38), which could increase ADC values for the tumor and be
unrelated to drug-induced apoptosis.
In contrast to the significant increases of ADC values at 1 day
after therapy in groups 3 and 4, tumor volumes were not changed
at this same time. This confirms that extracellular water increase
due to apoptosis preceded change in tumor size, and thereby DWI
may be more sensitive than the current method (Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) to measure early anticancer
efficacy following treatment. The decrease of ADC values in the
control groups (two experiments) was presumably caused by
increased tumor cell density (or fibrous tissue) over time, leading to
a decrease of extracellular water.
Although bioluminescence imaging detected significant decrease
of emitted light from tumors in groups 3 and 4 at 1 day after
initiating therapy, quantification error induced by attenuation of
optical light should be considered in days 2 to 3 (i.e., when tumor
volume shrank, the distance from the tumor to abdominal surface
became correspondingly greater, in general). Bioluminescence
signal could be reduced due to contribution of signal attenuation
as well as an actual decrease of viable tumor mass.
Early assessment of therapeutic efficacy is essential to prevent
unnecessary treatment and optimize therapeutic strategies to
extend patients’ lives. ADC quantification is a safe and logical
approach to establish personalized medicine and can be applied to
measure effective neoadjuvant therapy. Eqs. A and C show how to
predict the survival of animals that harbor pancreatic cancer
following treatment, based on monitoring early ADC change. These
equations will need adjustments following more extensive preclinical and clinical studies, to be used for human pancreatic cancer
prognosis, but they may serve as prototypes for future versions.

Each tumor was sliced into two pieces, which were then immersed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight at room temperature.

Tissue sections of 5-Am thickness were cut on an Accu-Cut SRM
microtome (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc.). Sections of paraffinembedded tissue were mounted on Bond-Rite slides from RichardAllan Scientific and heated at 60j for 2 h. Paraffin was removed from the sections by three changes of xylene and rehydrated
through graded alcohols from absolute to 70% for 5 min each.
The TUNEL assay was done with a Chemicon International
ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Detection Kit. The slides were
rehydrated as above and pretreated for 1 min in 10 mmol/L glycine
(pH 3) with fast cooling after the pressure cooker. The slides
were rinsed for a minimum of 2 h with deionized water after
the H2O2 quench. The procedure after the quenching was previously
described. The chromogen used was 3-3¶diaminobenzidine (BioGenex Laboratories, Inc.). After 7 min, the slides were rinsed with
water and lightly counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. The
sections were dehydrated through graded alcohols from 70% to
absolute and three xylene baths for 5 min each. The coverslips were
mounted with Permount.
