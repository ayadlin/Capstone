BACKGROUND. A study was conducted to determine the efficacy, tolerability, and
safety of concurrent cisplatin and vinorelbine chemotherapy and radiotherapy in
patients with previously untreated brain metastases from breast cancer.

METHODS. Twenty-five patients with untreated brain metastases from breast cancer were treated with cisplatin (at a dose of 20 mg/m2/day, Days 1-5) and vinorelbine (6-mg/m2 bolus on Day 1 and 6 mg/m2/day continuous infusion on Days
1-5) chemotherapy combined with concurrent 30-gray fractionated externalbeam radiotherapy. Chemotherapy was given at 3-week intervals for a total of 4
cycles. Primary endpoint was the rate of radiologic response of brain metastases.

RESULTS. Complete response in the brain was observed in 3 patients, and partial
response was noted in 16 patients, yielding a 76% response rate in the brain. The
overall systemic response rate was 44%. Progression-free and overall survival
were 3.7 months and 6.5 months, respectively. Overall toxicity was acceptable;
nonhematologic grade 3-4 events were noted in 5 (20%) patients, and there were
no toxic deaths.

CONCLUSIONS. Concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin and vinorelbine for
brain metastases from breast cancer appears to be active and well tolerated.

A

pproximately 10% to 30% of patients with metastatic breast cancer will develop central nervous system (CNS) involvement (ie,
leptomeningeal involvement or brain metastases) in the course of
their disease.1 CNS involvement is associated with debilitating neurologic symptoms, such as focal weakness, headache, and seizure.
Furthermore, brain metastases are associated with poor prognosis;
the median survival of these patients is usually 6 months, and has
not improved in the last 15 to 20 years.2-4
Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) remains the cornerstone of
treatment in the management of patients with brain metastases,
resulting in symptomatic improvement in the majority of patients.
However, response to WBRT is usually short-lasting, and impact on
survival is usually limited. Aggressive local therapies such as radiosurgery or neurosurgery combined with WBRT have shown promising results, but only apply to patients with few (1-3) brain
metastases.5,6 The role of systemic chemotherapy in the management of patients with brain metastases remains unclear, largely
because of issues regarding diffusion of cytotoxic drugs through the
blood-brain barrier. However, some investigators have reported

response rates in the 30% to 50% range, using in
most cases cisplatin-based regimens.7-9
Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy
have been shown to improve the rate of local control
over radiotherapy alone in diseases such as cancers
of the lung, head and neck, or rectum and glioblastoma.10-13 The addition of chemotherapy to standard
radiation could improve the activity of radiation on
brain disease through radiosensitizing mechanisms
and allow the concomitant treatment of other sites
of disease.
We conducted a prospective phase 2 trial to
assess the activity and toxicity of cisplatin and
vinorelbine (Navelbine; Pierre Fabre Médicament,
Boulogne, France) combination chemotherapy with
concurrent external-beam radiotherapy in patients
with previously untreated brain metastases from
breast cancer. Cisplatin was chosen 1) because cisplatin-based combinations were shown to be active
in the treatment of brain metastases14; 2) because
autopsy series showed therapeutic concentration of
cisplatin in brain metastases, but not in the adjacent
normal brain tissue15,16; and 3) because of its known
role as a radiosensitizer. Vinorelbine was chosen
because this drug had clinical activity in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated breast cancer,17 and we
believed that cisplatin alone would not be sufficient
to treat systemic disease. Furthermore, data from
studies in patients with brain metastases from lung
cancer demonstrated that concomitant chemoradiation with cisplatin and vinorelbine was feasible.18
The primary endpoint was radiologic response rate
of brain metastases, and secondary endpoints
included overall and progression-free survival (PFS),
safety, and tolerability. Preliminary results of this
phase 2 trial were presented as a poster at the 27th
San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, December 8
to 11, 2004.19

2533

Patients bearing a single metastasis that could be
treated by either surgery or radiosurgery were not eligible. Other exclusion criteria included the following:
progression during previous cisplatin-containing
and/or vinorelbine-containing chemotherapy; pregnancy or lactation; progressive brain metastases
inside a previously irradiated field; other serious illness or medical or psychiatric condition; and history
of other neoplasm (except for curatively treated
basocellular carcinoma of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ).
The study was approved by the institutional
ethics committee of the Leon Berard Center in Lyon,
and all patients provided written informed consent.

Study Design and Statistics
This was a multicentric, open-label, phase 2 trial
designed to assess the efficacy of WBRT combined
with cisplatin and vinorelbine (the CIVIC regimen17).
The primary endpoint was the response rate of brain
metastases. Other endpoints included assessment of
toxicity, PFS, overall survival (OS), and systemic
response rate.
Statistical design was done according to the
Gehan method.20 Briefly, 14 patients were to be
accrued at first; if no response was observed then
the trial was to be terminated, because the probability of further observing a response rate of at least
20% would be <5%. If at least 1 response was
observed among the first 14 patients, then more
patients were to be included.
Data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.
PFS was calculated from the day of study entry to
disease progression or death, whichever came first.
PFS in the brain was calculated from the date of
study entry to the date of brain progression (progression at other sites and death were considered as censored data), and OS was calculated from the date of
study entry to death from any cause. All curves were
displayed using the Kaplan-Meier method.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Patients with histologically proven metastatic breast
cancer were eligible if they met the following criteria:
female; aged between 18 and 70 years; World Health
Organization (WHO) performance status of 0, 1, or 2;
life expectancy of >3 months; absolute neutrophil
count >1.5 3 109/L; platelet count >100 3 109/L;
and serum creatinin <106 lmol/L (11.8 mg/L). Prior
chemotherapy, whether administered in the adjuvant
setting or for metastatic disease, was allowed. Hormonal treatment started before study entry could be
continued during the study. Patients were required to
provide written informed consent.

Treatment
Patients were to receive a standard 30-gray (Gy)
course of WBRT over 2 weeks (3.0 Gy/fraction/day 3
10 days), using high-energy photons. Chemotherapy
was to be initiated within 7 days after the start of
radiation. The CIVIC regimen has been previously
described17 and comprises vinorelbine in a 6-mg
bolus on Day 1, followed by vinorelbine at a dose of
6 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion on Days 1 to 5
and cisplatin at a dose of 20 mg/m2/day on Days 1
to 5. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.
In case of febrile neutropenia, grade 4 neutropenia
without fever lasting >6 days, grade 3 or 4 thrombo-

cytopenia, or grade 2 nonhematologic toxicity
(except alopecia), the dose for the following cycles
was to be reduced by 20%. Patients experiencing febrile neutropenia or grade >2 nonhematologic toxicity
after a dose-reduced cycle were withdrawn from the
study. During radiotherapy, patients received corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day and 20%
mannitol if signs of increased intracranial pressure
appeared.

Assessments
Prestudy evaluation included a history, physical
examination, hematology, serum biochemistry tests,
and serum CA 15-3. Brain metastases were assessed
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan if MRI was not possible.
Other targets were evaluated using standard techniques including CT scan, ultrasonography, and bone
scintigraphy when indicated. Physical examination
and complete blood cell count were repeated before
each cycle. Complete evaluation was repeated, using
the same imaging techniques used for prestudy evaluation, after Cycles 2 and 4. Response of brain metastases (also referred to as ‘‘brain response’’) was
assessed using criteria defined by Macdonald et al.21
Extracerebral response (also referred to as ‘‘systemic
response’’) was assessed according to WHO criteria22
and included the assessment of nonmeasurable disease. When multiple brain lesions were present, only
3 were serially measured for response assessment.
Patients experiencing overt clinical progression or in
whom progression was documented were withdrawn
from the study and were followed until death; further
treatments were left to the referring physician’s discretion. All toxicities were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria v2.

RESULTS
Patients
Between March 1998 and January 2000, 14 patients
were included in the first step of this trial. Seven partial and 3 complete responses in the brain and 5 partial responses and 1 complete systemic response
were observed. Nine more patients were therefore
included in the second step, for a total of 25 patients
accrued between March 1998 and March 2001. Their
main characteristics upon study entry are summarized in Table 1. Briefly, the median age of the
patients was 47 years (range, 31 years-70 years), 17
patients (74%) had Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade 3
tumors, 13 (52%) patients had previously received
adjuvant chemotherapy, and 14 (56%) patients had
previously received chemotherapy for metastatic

disease. Twenty-one patients (84%) had previously
received an anthracycline-containing regimen, 10
had previously received taxane, and 9 had received
both. Overall, only 2 patients were chemotherapy naive before entering the study. All patients had brain
metastases; the median number of brain metastases
was 2 (range, 1 to >10 brain metastases), 12 (48%)
patients had 3 brain metastases, and the median
number of metastatic sites (including the brain) was
3 (range, 1-4 metastatic sites). Although it was not an
exclusion criterion, none of the patients included in
this study had previous surgery or radiosurgery for
brain metastases. Four patients who had a single
brain metastasis were included after they were
deemed inoperable by a neurosurgeon.

Early Treatment Discontinuation and Toxicity
The median time between the initiation of WBRT
and the initiation of chemotherapy was 2 days
(range, 22 to 17) days; only 2 patients began chemotherapy >4 days after the beginning of WBRT (Day
6 and Day 7, precisely). Eleven (44%) patients discontinued treatment early either because of disease
progression in 7 (28%) patients or toxicity in 4 (16%)
patients. Early progression was both systemic and
cerebral in 4 patients and was systemic only in 3
patients. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity
that could be related to WBRT (nausea in 1 patient
and depression in 1 patient), and there were no
grade 4 adverse events during concomitant chemoradiation. Overall, the majority of toxicities from WBRT
were mild (Table 2). However, 23 of 25 patients
received prophylaxis for intracranial hypertension
with either steroids, mannitol, or both. The most
common grade 3-4 toxicities are displayed in Table 2.
Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities were noted in 20
(80%) patients, and was the most common toxicity; 5
(20%) patients experienced a grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity (asthenia in 3 patients, depression in 1
patient, and vomiting in 1 patient).

Response Rate, PFS, and OS
Response rates are displayed in Table 3. Response in
the brain could not be evaluated in 1 patient because
of the use of different imaging techniques between
baseline and other assessments. A second patient
could not be evaluated because she died before the
first assessment. Complete disappearance of brain
metastases was observed in 3 (12%) patients, and a
partial response was noted in 16 (64%) patients,
yielding a 76% response rate for brain metastases.
Two further patients had stable disease for 2.4
months and 3.4 months, respectively. Eight and 17
patients were assessed with CT scan and MRI,
respectively. Brain response rates were not found to
be significantly different between patients assessed
with MRI and CT: 13 of 15 (87%) patients (2 patients
assessed with MRI at baseline could not be evaluated) and 6 of 8 (75%) patients, respectively (P 5
.49). The median PFS in the brain, calculated from
the date of study entry to the date of brain progression, was 5.2 months (range, 0.5 months-53.3
months) (Fig. 1). The brain was the first site of disease progression in 16 patients. For responding
patients, the median duration of response was 8.5
months.
Systemic response (ie, cerebral and extracerebral
disease) was complete in 1 patient (4%) and partial
in 10 (40%), for an overall systemic response rate of
44%. Five patients had stable disease for a median of
4.2 months (range, 2.8 months-6.8 months). Systemic
PFS, calculated from the date of study entry to the
date of disease progression (brain or other organ) or
death, whichever came first, was 3.7 months (range,
0.2 months-46.5 months) (Fig. 2). Four (16%) patients

The median OS was 6.5 months (range 0.5
months-62.1 months) (Fig. 2). Seven (28%) patients
were alive at 12 months. In an exploratory analysis,
patients were stratified by recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, based on the work by Gaspar et al
from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group.23
Patients from classes I and II were pooled because of
the small number of patients in class I (1 patient). As
shown in Figure 3, patients classified as RPA class III
had a significantly poorer outcome, with a median
OS of 4.2 months, compared with 8.4 months for
patients classified as RPA class I or II (P 5 .0026).

were progression free at 12 months. In 3 patients a
partial response of brain metastases was observed,
whereas extracerebral disease progressed.
At the time of disease progression 18 (72%)
patients received salvage therapy; some of them
received several lines of chemotherapy, either for
cerebral or for systemic disease progression or both.

The management of patients with brain metastases
is challenging, and treatment options have remained
virtually unchanged for more than 2 decades. Concurrent chemoradiation is currently being investigated with the aim of improving the control rate of
both cerebral and systemic disease. Molecularly targeted agents are also currently under investigation
for the treatment of patients with brain metastases.24,25 Another direction of current research is focusing on patients’ selection, to offer more aggressive
therapy for patients who are likely to benefit from
the added treatment intensity. The RPA classification
is currently recognized as a major prognostic factor
in patients with brain metastases and is based on

Chemoradiation for Brain Metastases/Cassier et al

simple clinical factors: Karnofsky performance status,
age, and the control of extracerebral disease.
The goal of the current trial was to assess the
efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy and concurrent
chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine for
patients with brain metastases from breast cancer.
This combination shows a high rate of objective
response in the brain (76%) combined with an
interesting systemic response rate (44%) in the setting of taxane- and/or anthracycline-pretreated patients.
By using this regimen, the median brain and systemic
PFS were 5.2 months and 3.7 months, respectively, with
a median OS of 6.5 months. Overall grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicities were infrequent, which combined with the systemic response rate, is consistent
with our previously reported experience with the
CIVIC regimen.17
Other studies of concurrent chemoradiation for
brain metastases of solid tumors have reported
response rates of 50% and up to 96%.26,27 However,
the median PFS and OS times remain disappointingly
low in most studies. In their study of concurrent topotecan and WBRT, Gruschow et al reported a median
survival of 5 months,26 which is comparable to what
was previously reported for WBRT alone.4 Antonadou
et al reported a significant improvement in response
rate using temozolomide and concomitant radiation
as compared with radiation alone in a randomized
phase 2 trial. This improvement in response rate did
not translate into a significant advantage in median
OS, although there appeared to be a trend toward
improved survival in the chemoradiation arm.27 The
PFS and OS in both of these studies is comparable to
those reported in our study.
Several studies have assessed the role of chemotherapy for the treatment of brain metastases. Rivera
et al reported that combination chemotherapy using
temozolomide and capecitabine was efficient and
well tolerated in treating brain metastases from
breast cancer, including brain metastases recurring
after radiotherapy.28 Christodoulou et al reported
on the use of cisplatin-temozolomide combination
chemotherapy for patients with brain metastases
from solid tumors. In their study, the response rate
was 30%, and 16% of patients had stable disease.8
However, in both of these studies PFS and OS were
short.8,28 These studies demonstrate that, as was previously shown in nonsmall cell lung cancer, the
response rate and disease control rate of brain metastases with chemotherapy are comparable to those
of systemic disease18; the addition of WBRT to chemotherapy could improve the response rate at this site
and therefore reduces the prevalence of neurologic
symptoms, thereby improving quality of life.

2537

In conclusion, the results of the current study
show that chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine combined with concurrent WBRT is feasible
and induces a high response rate in brain metastases from breast cancer while providing an interesting response rate of systemic disease, and has an
acceptable toxicity profile. However, despite this
high rate of cerebral control, benefit in OS appears
to be marginal compared with radiotherapy alone.
This combination could therefore have interest for
patients with both cerebral and extracerebral disease
progression.
