ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer is relatively insensitive to conventional chemotherapy.
Therefore, novel agents targeting dysregulated pathways (MAPK/ERK, EGFR, TGF-β,
HEDGEHOG, NOTCH, IGF, PARP, PI3K/AKT, RAS, and Src) are being explored in clinical
trials as monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. This review
summarizes the most recent advances with the targeted therapies in the treatment
of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

of strategies targeting dysregulated signaling pathways
implicated in the development and progression of this
devastating cancer. These targeted therapies include
small-molecule inhibitors of signaling proteins such as
Hedgehog, MEK, RAS, and SRC [16–21]; as well as
cell-membrane proteins such as EGFR [22]. This review
discusses new targeted therapies that have progressed
from preclinical studies into clinical trials for the treatment
of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer either as
monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic agents
in an attempt to achieve better responses and improve
survival.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),
otherwise known as pancreatic carcinoma or pancreatic
cancer, is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized
by local and vascular invasion, extensive regional lymph
node metastasis, and distant metastases [1]. PDAC is the
ninth most common malignancy in western countries,
but represents the fourth leading cause of cancer related
death [2, 3]. Approximately 80% of patients have either
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease at the
time of diagnosis and three-quarter of those who undergo
curative surgical resection develop recurrent disease [4–7].
As such, pancreatic cancer is considered to be a systemic
disease in the majority of patients at the time of diagnosis.
Unfortunately, PDAC typically demonstrates innate
resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics, due in part
to multiple molecular aberrations, dense desmoplastic
reaction, poor angiogenesis and tumor microenvironment
hypoxia [8–10]. Responses are often short-lived and
prognosis is dismal. Primary resection with subsequent
adjuvant chemotherapy yields a median survival of 20–22
months in resectable disease [6, 7, 11, 12]. With current
chemotherapy regimens, the median survival for patients
with unresectable/metastatic tumors is 9–11 months
[13–15].
A better understanding of the molecular basis of
pancreatic carcinogenesis has led to the development

CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES
In newly diagnosed patients with advanced
unresectable /metastatic pancreatic cancer, gemcitabineand fluoropyrimidine- based chemotherapy have been
established as the preferred initial treatment options for
most patients with the goal of prolonging survival and
improving the quality of life. Specifically, gemcitabine
plus nab-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX (combination of
5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, irinotecan and oxaliplatin)
demonstrated high response rates and modest
improvement in overall survival [14, 15]. In contrast,
the combination of gemcitabine with other cytotoxic
agents including oxaliplatin, irinotecan, cisplatin,
fluorouracil/leucovorin, pemetrexed or capecitabine

failed to show a survival benefit over gemcitabine alone
in prospective phase II/III studies (Table 1) [23–29].
Similarly, gemcitabine with monoclonal antibodies
(e.g bevacizumab, cetuximab, ganitumab) did not reveal
improvement in survival when compared to gemcitabine
alone in phase III CALGB, SWOG, and GAMMA trials
(Table 2) [30–32]. Recent trials employing gemcitabine
plus small molecule inhibitors such as sorafenib, tipifarnib,
rigosertib, trametinib, aflibercept, sunitinib, everolimus,
or axitinib failed to show better survival in comparison
with gemcitabine monotherapy in randomized placebocontrolled phase II/III studies in previously untreated
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (Table 3)
[33–39]. Nevertheless, Moore et al reported that
gemcitabine plus erlotinib conferred significant survival
advantage with improved overall survival (OS) and
progression free survival (PFS) rates [40]. These findings
underscore further development of targeted agents in the
treatment of patients with advanced unresectable and
metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

death receptor 5 (DR5). This antibody induces tumor
cell apoptosis and growth inhibition by triggering both
extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic, caspase-mediated
signaling pathways [43, 44]. In vitro studies showed that
tigatuzumab induces selective, dose-dependent cytotoxicity
in several human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines including
MIA PaCa-2 [41, 45, 46]. Tigatuzumab did not induce cell
death in human primary hepatocytes. In xenografted MIA
PaCa-2 mouse model of human pancreatic carcinoma,
tigatuzumab dosed at 0.3 and 3 mg/kg in combination with
gemcitabine at 400 mg/kg substantially inhibited tumor
growth with complete tumor regression noted in two of 10
mice treated with the higher tigatuzumab dose [41].
In an initial, multi-institutional, open-label, phase I
dose-escalation study, tigatuzumab at dose levels of 1, 2,
4, and 8 mg/kg was administered weekly by intravenous
infusion to 17 patients with relapsed or refractory
carcinomas and lymphoma [47]. After at least 2 cycles
of treatment, tigatuzumab was found to be safe, welltolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the
maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. The most
common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, fatigue,
pyrexia, anemia, and cough. No serious treatment-related
toxicities observed [47]. Stable disease was achieved in
approximately 41% of patients for a prolonged period of
time [47]. These results prompted a phase II trial to evaluate
the efficacy of tigatuzumab administered in combination
with gemcitabine to chemotherapy-naive patients diagnosed
with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer [48].
Sixty-five patients, predominantly Caucasians with median
age of 60.6 years, received tigatuzumab intravenously on
days 1, 8, 15, and 21 (8 mg/kg loading dose followed by
3 mg/kg per week) and intravenous gemcitabine on days
1, 8, and 15 (1000 mg/m2) until disease progression or
unacceptable toxicity.  Tolerability profile was acceptable

NOVEL MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES
Tigatuzumab (CS-1008)
Tigatuzumab, also known as CS-1008, is an
intravenously bioavailable, humanized murine IgG1
monoclonal antibody with a molecular weight of
144.6kDA, and composed of the complementarity
determining region (CDR) of the murine monoclonal
antibody TRA-8 and the variable region framework
and constant regions of human immunoglobulin IgG1mAb58′CL [41, 42]. The antibody demonstrates potent
agonist property against TRAIL (tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand) receptor 2 (TR-2)/

as the most common toxicities were grade 1 or 2 nausea,
fatigue, abdominal pain, constipation, and fever after a
median duration of treatment of approximately 18 weeks.
No new treatment-emergent adverse events were seen
[47, 48]. Of 61 patients evaluated for efficacy, the overall
response rate (ORR) was 13.1% with a median duration
of response of 309 days. The primary endpoint, PFS at
16 weeks, was 53%, and the median PFS and OS were
3.9 months and 8.2 months respectively [48]. Tigatuzumab
combined with gemcitabine was well tolerated and may
improve survival outcomes in patients with unresectable or
metastatic pancreatic cancer. Tigatuzumab has now entered
phase II clinical trials for the treatment of patients with a
variety of solid neoplasms including pancreatic cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma,
and ovarian cancer [NCT00521404, NCT00991796,
NCT01033240, NCT00945191].

It.is over-expressed on the surface of several human
malignancies including pancreatic tumor cells [49–52].
When activated by its ligands (IGF-I and -II), the receptor
sends signals that exert antiapoptotic effects and confers
increased tumor growth, resistance to chemotherapeutics,
and motility of cancer cells via multiple signaling cascades
(Figure 1) [53, 54]. Dalotuzumab is a novel, recombinant
humanized IgG1 monoclonal antagonist antibody that
binds to IGF-1R with high affinity (Kd = 1 nmol/L). This
induces receptor internalization and degradation, and inhibits
IGF-I- and IGF-II- mediated pancreatic cancer growth and
metastasis [55–57]. In preclinical studies, dalotuzumab
(also known as MK-0646 or h7C10) enhances gemcitabineinduced apoptosis and inhibits signaling pathways that
confer increased cellular proliferation, survival and drug
resistance in pancreatic cancer [56, 58]. The first-in-human
study of dalotuzumab showed the agent was generally
well-tolerated, exhibited positive pharmacodynamic
effects, and favorable clinical activity in patients with
advanced solid cancers [59]. The most common adverse
event was hyperglycemia. Subsequently, a phase I/II study

Conatumumab (AMG-655)

human TR-2) /DR5 [61]. Conatumumab binds to and
activates TR-2 /DR5, leading to activation of downstream

caspase cascades and tumor cell apoptosis. TR-2 is
highly expressed by pancreatic tumor cells than normal
pancreatic tissue. The TR-2 high expression makes it an
attractive, druggable target for cancer therapeutics [62].
Treatment with conatumumab alone or in combination
with gemcitabine demonstrated potent antitumor activity
against pancreatic tumor xenograft [61]. The safety
and preliminary clinical activity of conatumumab in
combination with gemcitabine have been evaluated in
a phase IB multicenter trial of 13 previously-untreated
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [63]. Participants
received conatumumab 3 or 10 mg/kg IV day 1 and 15,
and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV on day 1, 8, and 15 of
every 28-day cycle. After a median treatment of 6 cycles,
the combination appeared tolerable and no DLTs were
observed. Thrombocytopenia, abdominal pain, and
neutropenia were the most common serious adverse
events. Preliminary efficacy data showed a PR of 31%,
median PFS of 5.3 months, and a 6-month OS rate of
76% [63]. Given these data, conatumumab combined
with gemcitabine was advanced to a placebo-controlled,
randomized phase II clinical testing [64]. No new safety
signal emerged after median treatment of 4 cycles. The
disease control rate was 65% in the combination arm
versus 40% for the placebo arm, with an improved
6-month OS rate of 59% versus and 50% respectively [64].
Additional investigation into this combination in patients
with advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer is warranted.

6 weeks [67]. This preliminary evidence of activity of
cixutumumab has prompted multiple early phase trials
in advanced solid tumors. In a recent report of a phase
IB/II SWOG S0727study, administration of cixutumumab
6 mg/kg/week intravenously in combination with
erlotinib 100 mg/day orally, and gemcitabine
1000 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a
28-day cycle demonstrated tolerable toxicity profile in
chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced/metastatic
pancreatic cancer [68]. The most common serious adverse
effects were transaminitis, hyperglycemia, fatigue, and
cytopenia. When compared with the control arm (erlotinib
plus gemcitabine), the addition of cixutumumab to erlotinib
and gemcitabine did not lead to longer PFS or OS. The
median PFS and OS were 3.6 and 7.0 months respectively on
the cixutumumab arm, and 3.6 and 6.7 months respectively
on the control arm [68].
At this time, it is unclear how much, if any, benefit this
specific agent would add to that achieved with conventional
approaches. Evaluation of cixutumumab with other active
agents in pancreatic cancer is warranted in future trials
to determine whether or not this antibody will produce
clinically, meaningful benefit in patients with PDAC.

R-1507
Like dalotuzumab, R-1507 is a humanized IgG1
monoclonal antibody with potent, highly selective,
antagonist activity against the extracellular domain of
IGF-1R characterized by intracellular internalization
and degradation of the receptor [69]. The antibody
demonstrates antitumor activity against pancreatic cell
lines and delays tumor growth in xenograft models [70].
Preclinical studies by Kawanami and colleagues showed
that R-1507 interacted synergistically with gemcitabine
and/or metformin to inhibit proliferation and growth
in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines
SUIT-2 and MIAPaCa-2 [71]. Treatment with R-1507 and
everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, demonstrated substantial
anti-proliferative activity against pancreatic cell line
BxPC-3 [72]. The agent was well-tolerated up to a dose
of 9 mg/kg weekly in a phase I trial [73]. No DLTs were
observed and the most common drug-related adverse effects
were fatigue and nausea. Further investigations are warranted
to establish whether IGF-1R inhibition with R-1507 alone or
in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy will improve
outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

Cixutumumab (IMC-A12)
Cixutumumab, also known as IMC-A12, is a potent,
highly selective, fully human IgG1 monoclonal blocking
antibody with dual, subnanomolar inhibitory activity
(IC50 = 0.6–1 nM) against IGF-1R homodimers as well
as heterodimeric insulin receptor /IGF-1R in tumor cells
(Figure 1) [65, 66]. Cixutumumab lacks antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Rather, it selectively binds to
IGF-1R or IR/IGF-1R with high affinity (Kd = 0.04 nM),
triggers internalization and degradation of the receptor, and
indirectly blocks both IGF-I and -II mediated ERK-MAPK
(proliferative) as well as the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (survival)
signaling pathway activation [66]. Cixutumumab exhibited
broad anti-mitogenic activity on multiple tumor cell lines
including breast cancer line (T47D), pancreatic cancer
line (BxPC-3), and multiple myeloma cell line (RPMI8226) [66]. In BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer xenograft models,
cixutumumab induced tumor shrinkage by eighty percent at
a dose of 1mg every three days [66].
Infusion reactions, anemia, rash, pruritus, dizziness,
and fatigue were the common side-effects observed in
the first phase I dose escalation study of 16 patients with
relapsed/refractory solid neoplasms including breast,
bladder, pancreatic, endometrial, hepatocellular carcinoma,
and phaechromocytoma [67]. The DLT was hyperglycemia.
Though no objective response was observed, nine
patients experienced stable disease lasting for more than

AGS-1C4D4
AGS-1C4D4 is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal
antibody directed against the human prostate stem cell
antigen (PSCA) with potential anti-neoplastic activity.
The mechanism of action is designed to selectively
bind to the extracellular domain of PSCA and triggers
complement-dependent cell lysis (CDC) and ADCC
in tumor cells expressing PSCA [74]. PSCA is a
39525

glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked cell surface
protein. It is overexpressed on the cell surfaces of a variety
of cancer cell types, including pancreatic cancer, and may
play a key role in cell proliferation, invasion, and survival
[75, 76]. Targeting PSCA has been shown as a promising
anti-tumor strategy in pancreatic cancers in preclinical
models [77, 78].
In phase I studies, the compound demonstrated
acceptable toxicity profile with no DLTs at
48 mg/kg loading dose followed by 24 mg/kg every
3 weeks intravenously [74, 79], and this dose was carried
to a randomized phase II trial in patients with advanced/
metastatic pancreatic cancer [80]. In this multicenter study,
previously untreated, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
patients were randomly assigned 1:2 to gemcitabine
(1000 mg/m2) or gemcitabine plus AGS-1C4D4 antibody
[80]. The trial met its primary endpoint. The 6-month
survival rate was significantly improved in the combination
therapy arm compared to gemcitabine alone arm (60.9%
versus 44.4%; p = 0.03), while the median OS were
7.6 months and 5.5 months in the two arms, respectively
[80]. Another phase II trial is investigating the activity
and safety of this regimen in the second-line therapy for
chemotherapy-refractory patients with advanced/metastatic
pancreatic cancer [NCT01608711].

HuPAM4, directed against the pancreatic cancer antigen
mucin-1(MUC-1), that is conjugated to the chelating
agent tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic acid (DOTA),
and radiolabeled with the beta-emitting radioisotope
Yttrium90 [84]. MUC-1is a cell membrane surface
glycoprotein with extensive O-linked glycosylation of
its extracellular domain [85]. It is overexpressed in more
than 85% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas and absent
in normal pancreas, making it an attractive target for
anti-cancer therapeutics [86–88]. Aberrant activation of
the MUC-1-dependent pathways has been implicated
in initiation and maintenance of malignant phenotype.
Increased expression enhances beta-catenin mediated
cancer invasion, and promotes both p53- and PI3KAKT-dependent cell survival [89–91]. Clivatuzumab
tetraxetan demonstrates ADCC. The compound selectively
binds to tumor cells expressing MUC-1, undergoes
internalization, and delivers high cytotoxic dose of beta
radiation to the tumor cells [92, 93]. In athymic nude mice
bearing CaPan1 human pancreatic cancer xenografts,
clivatuzumab alone or in combination with gemcitabine
exhibited substantial antitumor response [94–97].
A phase I dose-escalation trial of clivatuzumab
teraxetan enrolled 21 patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer. These patients were treated with single dose
of 15, 20, or 25 mCi/m2. The radioimmunoconjugate
was well-tolerated. DLTs included neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia, which occurred at 25 mCi/m2.
Therefore, 20 mCi/m2 was established as the MTD
and chosen for further studies [98]. Notably, 2 patients
developed human anti-human antibody (HAHA). Of
twenty patients evaluated for response at week 4 after
treatment, there were three PR and four with stable
disease (SD) [98]. When clivatuzumab was administered
at weekly fractionated doses together with low dose
gemcitabine, no new treatment-related toxicities were
noted [84]. The disease control rate was higher at 58%
(6 PR, 16 SD) presumably due to the radiosensitizing
effect of gemcitabine.
These encouraging results led to initiation of
phase II/III clinical trials of clivatuzumab in advanced
pancreatic cancer. Final results of a multicenter phase IB
study of 58 heavily-pretreated patients with pancreatic
cancer were recently reported at the 2014 ASCO Annual
Meeting [99]. In arm A, twenty-nine patients received  the
combination of fractionated doses of clivatuzumab
tetraxetan once-a-week for 3 weeks with gemcitabine given
weekly for 4 weeks while 29 patients in arm B were treated
with 4 doses of clivatuzumab tetraxetan alone. The treatment
cycle was repeated every 4 weeks until unacceptable
toxicity or disease progression or patient withdrawal. The
median OS of patients who received combination therapy
(7.9 months) was significantly  longer than that of patients
who received antibody alone  (3.4 months) [P = 0.004]
[99]. Given these favorable results, a phase III PANCRIT-1
registration trial has been initiated to confirm these findings.

Tarextumab (OMP-59R5)
Tarextumab (formerly OMP-59R5) is a novel, highly
selective, fully human IgG2 monoclonal blocking antibody
that binds to and prevents signaling through both the Notch2
and Notch3 receptors [81]. Notch signaling plays a critical
role in pancreatic cancer transformation, tumor progression,
and chemotherapy resistance. In preclinical models,
tarextumab exhibited substantial tumor regressions in
Notch3-expressing human pancreatic cancer xenografts when
combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine via inhibition
of cancer stem cell growth, promotion of cell differentiation,
as well as disruption of tumor angiogenesis [81]. Although
the anti-NOTCH agent (RO4929097) failed to improve
survival [82], final data from a phase IB trial demonstrated
encouraging clinical activity of tarextumab in combination
with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in treatment naïve
pancreatic cancer patients [81, 83]. The combination was
well-tolerated and no DLTs occurred. Frequently reported
adverse effects were cytopenia, fatigue, GI toxicities,
peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia. A phase II ALPINE
study of this combination is underway [NCT01647828].

SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS

Masitinib (AB1010)

Vismodegib (GDC-0449)

Masitinib (AB1010) is a potent, ATP competitive,
multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor with nanomolar activity
(≤ 500 nM) [116] and potential antineoplastic activity.
A benzamide derivative, masitinib selectively binds to
and inhibits both the wild-type and mutated forms of the
stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit; SCFR); platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR); and fibroblast growth
factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) [116]. The compound enhances
the antiproliferative effects of gemcitabine in gemcitabinerefractory human pancreatic cell lines Mia Paca2 and
Panc1 by downregulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
pathway [117]. Substantial clinical progress has been
seen with masitinib. In a phase I dose-escalation study
conducted in patients with advanced and/or metastatic
pancreatic cancer, the MTD was not reached but a dose
of 12 mg/kg/day was found to be safe for the treatment
of patients with solid cancers [118]. In a phase II trial in
combination with gemcitabine, masitinib demonstrated
substantial clinical activity in treatment naïve patients
with advanced pancreatic cancer [119], resulting in its
advancement to phase III registration study. This trial
met its primary endpoint of median time-to-progression
(TTP) (6.4 months) which was well beyond the threshold
(2.1 months) set by the investigators [119]. The results of
the first prospective, international, randomized, doubleblinded clinical trial of masitinib plus gemcitabine as
first line treatment in patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer were presented at the 2013 American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting. Three hundred and
fourty eight patients were randomized to receive either
masitinib (9 mg/kg/day) in combination with gemcitabine
(1000 mg/m2/weekly) or placebo plus gemcitabine
with overall survival (OS) being the primary end point
[120]. A gene expression profiling assay of whole blood
samples was also conducted before initiation of treatment
to identify genetic expression patterns predictive of
overall survival and/or treatment benefit. Overall, no
difference in OS was demonstrated (HR = 0.90; 95% CI,
0.71–1.14; p = 0.74). However, masitinib in combination
with gemcitabine significantly extended median OS in two
independent patient populations [120]. Firstly, median
OS was significantly prolonged in patients with pain at
baseline (defined as a VAS score > 20 mm on a 100 mm
scale) from 5.4 months in the placebo arm to 8.1 months
in the masitinib arm (p = 0.010). In another separate cohort
analysis of patients with a specific deleterious genomic
biomarker (GBM) indicative of aggressive disease, the
median OS was superior with combination of masitinib
plus gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine plus placebo
(11.0 versus 5.0 months, respectively; p = 0.000038) [120].

Vismodegib (GDC-0449, HhAntag-691) is an orally
administered, specific, irreversible, and highly potent
hedgehog pathway (Hh) inhibitor approved by the FDA in
January 2012 for treatment of patients with unresectable
locally advanced/metastatic basal cell carcinoma of the
skin [100, 101]. The Hh pathway is activated by binding of
Hh ligands (Sonic, Desert, Indian) to the transmembrane
G-protein-coupled receptor (Patched), which in turn
releases the suppression of signal transducing protein
(Smoothened) that triggers a cascade of events resulting
in expression of Hh-responsive genes [102]. Uncontrolled
activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has
emerged as a central player in neoplastic transformation,
tumor growth and cancer survival in a growing number
of hematologic and solid malignancies including the
skin, breast, lung, liver, and pancreatic carcinomas
along with colon and brain tumors [103–108]. The
components of Sonic Hh signaling pathway, including
the ligand (SHh), the signaling molecules (Patched-1,
Patched-2 and Smoothened) and effectors (Gli1, and
Gli2) are aberrantly expressed in human pancreatic cancer
cell lines and pancreatic cancer stem cells [109–111].
Vismodegib induces cell apoptosis and inhibits survival
in dose-dependent manner in pancreatic cell lines by
selectively binding to and downregulating the expression
of Smoothened, Patched-1, and Patched-2 [112, 113].
Similarly, vismodegib inhibited the expression of
transcription factor Gli1 and Gli2 [112].
Vismodegib has been assessed in a multi-center,
placebo-controlled, phase IB/randomized phase II
study of previously untreated patients with metastatic
pancreatic cancer [114]. One hundred and six patients
were randomized in 1:1 to gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2
over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15), every 28 days plus
either placebo (GP) or vismodegib (150 mg PO daily)
(GV). Toxicity between the 2 groups was similar.
The most serious adverse events were cytopenia,
hyponatremia, fatigue, and hyperglycemia [114]. Adding
vismodegib to gemcitabine chemotherapy as frontline
therapy yielded disappointing results. No improvement
in median PFS (4.0/2.5 months) and median OS
(6.9/6.1 months) when compared with gemcitabine
alone, although 22 patients on the GP crossed over to
the GV at progression, which could have complicated
the outcome [114]. Interim results from an ongoing open
label phase II trial of untreated pancreatic cancer patients
showed that vismodegib (150mg PO daily) combined
with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) plus nab-paclitaxel
(125 mg/m2) on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28 days cycle
demonstrated acceptable toxicity profile [115]. Of fortynine patients evaluated for response, the ORR was 43%.
Data analysis showed a median PFS of 5.5 months and
OS of 10 months [115].

Selumetinib (AZD-6244, ARRY-142886)
Selumetinib (also known as AZD-6244 or ARRY142886) is an orally bioavailable, non-ATP competitive,
39527

Oncotarget

highly selective MEK 1/2 inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity at nanomolar concentration (IC50 of
14 nm) [17, 121]. In murine BxPC3 pancreatic tumor
xenograft models, selumetinib significantly inhibited
tumor growth [121], and its antitumor activity correlated
with substantial decrease in phosphorylated ERK1/2
levels. A phase I dose escalation study of 57 patients
with advanced cancers including pancreatic carcinoma
identified 100mg BID as safe and well-tolerated [122].
Rash, diarrhea and hypoxia were reported as the major
DLTs. Results of a recently published phase II trial showed
no difference in overall survival between selumetinib and
capecitabine as second-line treatment in 70 patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer who had been pretreated with
a gemcitabine-based regimen [20]. The median OS was
5.4 months in the selumetinib group versus 5.0 months in
the capecitabine group (p = 0.92) [20]. Dual targeting of
MEK/EGFR signaling with selumetinib and erlotinib in
46 previously-treated patients with advanced/metastatic
pancreatic cancer demonstrated a disease control rate of
51%. The estimated median PFS and OS were 2.6 and
7.5 months respectively [123]. Additional clinical trials are
currently underway to further explore this targeted agent in
combination strategies [NCT01658943, NCT01061749].

cancer [128]. The DLTs were grade 3 confusion with
ataxia and disorientation, and grade 4 suicidal ideation.
Asthenia, ocular disturbance, skin rash, GI toxicities, and
cytopenias were the most common adverse events [128].
Further clinical data are awaited.

Refametinib (RDEA119, BAY 869766)
Refametinib is another MEK inhibitor that has
progressed to early phase clinical testing in patients with
advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer. A cyclopropane1-sulfonamide derivative, refametinib inhibits cell
proliferation in several tumor cell lines including BxPC3
human pancreatic cell line [129]. The compound alone
or in combination with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor,
showed significant growth inhibition in murine xenograft
models of human pancreatic cancer cells OCIP19,
21, and 23 mediated by cell cycle arrest predominantly
in G1 phase [130]. The combination of refametinib and
gemcitabine as first-line treatment of sixty patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer showed encouraging results
in a single-arm, open label, phase IIA clinical trial with
stable disease and partial response shown in 38% and
35%, respectively [131]. The compound demonstrated
acceptable safety profile with most common toxicities
being cytopenia, transaminitis, hypertension, rash and
fatigue [131].

Saracatinib (AZD-0530)
A quinazolinamine derivative, saracatinib (formerly
AZD-0530) is an orally bioavailable, dual-specific inhibitor
of Src and Abl tyrosine kinases with antitumor activity
at nanomolar concentrations (IC50 = 4–10 nM) [124]. In
preclinical models of pancreatic cancer, saracatinib showed
great antitumor activity in orthotopic ASPC-1xenograft
mice through inhibition of Src phosphorylation and
induction of cell cycle arrest at G1/S [124].
In first-line setting, phase I/II trial by Renouf
et al. [125] evaluated the combination of saracatinib
(175 mg PO daily) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) in
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and showed the
combination was safe and generally well-tolerated. The
phase II part of the trial did not meet its primary endpoint
of objective tumor response (ORR) plus stable disease ≥ 4
months, and was closed to further accrual [125].

Galunisertib (LY-2157299)
Galunisertib, also known as LY-2157299, is a
novel selective small molecule inhibitor of transforming
growth factor beta receptor 1(TGF-βR1) with potential
antitumor activity mediated by reducing levels of active,
phosphorylated SMAD [132]. A phase IB trial of this
agent in combination with gemcitabine in advanced solid
malignancies including pancreatic cancer demonstrated
acceptable toxicity [133]. The PK profile of galunisertib
was unchanged, and no DLTs were observed [133].
Galunisertib at 300 mg/day has been advanced into a
randomized Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer in first-line
setting to assess the antitumor activity of this combination
[NCT02154646, NCT01373164].

Pimasertib (AS-703026, MSC-1936369B)

Talazoparib (BMN-673)

Pimasertib,
also
known
as AS703026,
MSC1936369B, is a highly potent, ATP noncompetitive,
second generation small molecule inhibitor of MEK1
and MEK2 [126]. It exhibited potent antitumor activity
by selectively binding to the allosteric site on MEK1/2;
induced G0-G1 cell cycle arrest via downregulation of
pERK1/2; and triggered apoptosis by caspase-3 and
PARP cleavage [127]. Interim safety data from an ongoing
open label phase II trial showed that pimasertib was safe
and well-tolerated when combined with gemcitabine in
chemotherapy naïve patients with advanced pancreatic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Talazoparib, also known as BMN-673, is a novel,
orally bioavailable inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with potent
anti-neoplastic activity at subnanomolar concentration
(IC50 = 0.58 nM) [134]. It selectively binds to PARP
and prevents PARP-mediated DNA repair of single
strand DNA breaks via the base-excision repair
pathway. As a consequence, there is accumulation of
DNA strand breaks, increased genomic instability,
leading to apoptosis in target cells [134]. The agent
39528

has demonstrated efficacy with acceptable toxicity in
patients with BRCA- mutant solid tumors including
pancreatic cancer [135]. The recommended phase II dose
is 1000 μg/day, and the main DLT is thrombocytopenia
[135]. Additional phase I/II trials are ongoing
[NCT02286687, NCT01989546, NCT01286987].

tumor growth inhibition in human pancreatic cancer
xenografts [140].
The development of salirasib in advanced
pancreatic cancer is still in the early clinical stage
[141, 142]. A recently reported phase I study involving
treatment-naïve patients with advanced, metastatic
pancreatic cancer demonstrated good tolerability and
encouraging clinical activity [141]. In combination with
standard dose and schedule of gemcitabine, salirasib
at 200–800 mg orally twice daily for 21 days every
28 days showed no overlapping pharmacokinetics. The
most common adverse events were hematologic and GI
toxicities, and fatigue [141]. The combination regimen
achieved a median OS of 6.2 months and the 1-year
survival of 37% in nineteen patients enrolled in the
study [141]. The recommended dose for phase II trials
was 600 mg twice daily.

Veliparib (ABT-888)
Veliparib (formerly ABT-888) is an orally
bioavailable, carboxamide derivative with potent
inhibitory property against PARP 1 and PARP 2 at
concentrations (IC50) of 5.2 nM and 2.9 nM respectively
[136]. Like talazoparib, ABT-888 selectively binds to
PARP, inhibits DNA repair, and potentiates cytotoxicity
of DNA-damaging agents such as alkylating compounds
(e.g. temozolomide, platinums, cyclophosphamide) and
ionizing radiation in syngeneic and xenograft tumor
models [136, 137]. When combined with cisplatin and
gemcitabine in a phase IB trial of untreated pancreatic
cancer patients, veliparib demonstrated a tolerable toxicity
profile with high clinical activity in BRCA-mutant tumors
[138]. Serious adverse effects were anemia, neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. The recommended
phase II dose was 80 mg PO BID on day 1–12 every
3 weeks with fixed doses of cisplatin (25 mg/m2 IV) and
gemcitabine (600mg/m2 IV) on day three and ten [138].
Given these encouraging results, a two-part phase II
trial of this compound has been initiated in this setting
[NCT01585805]. In the first part, patients with untreated
pancreatic cancer and BRCA and/or PALB2 mutations will
be randomly assigned to receive gemcitabine and cisplatin
with or without veliparib. In the other part, patients with
relapses/refractory pancreatic cancer will receive veliparib
alone. Patients from the first part whose cancer did not
respond to gemcitabine and cisplatin treatment alone are
eligible to participate in the second part of the trial.

CONCLUSION
The survival of pancreatic cancer patients with
either unresectable locally advanced or metastatic
disease rarely surpasses 11 months with standard
chemotherapy regimens. Recent efforts have identified
multiple dysregulated signaling pathways in pancreatic
cancer development and progression, many of which
appear to be reasonable targets including PI3K/mTOR,
SIRT1, and ALK [143–146]. The data from clinical
trials on clivatuzumab, masitinib, veliparib, and salirasib
are particularly encouraging. Further research into
combinations of multiple targeted agents as well as
mixture of these inhibitors in combination with cytotoxic
agents to achieve optimal vertical or horizontal blockade
will most likely improve the bleak outlook in patients with
advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer [147].

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

Salirasib (FTS)

This study was partly supported by Henan Cancer
Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou China.

The RAS signaling pathway plays a key role in
signal transduction, cell motility, proliferation, survival
and malignant transformation [17]. Up to 90% of human
pancreatic cancers are driven by aberrant oncogenic RAS
signaling and associated with increased tumor invasion and
metastasis. Unfortunately, previous attempts to directly
block RAS activity by inhibition of farnesyltransferase
have been ineffective, as multiple escape pathways exist
that allow for alternative prenylation of RAS protein
[37, 139]. Salirasib is a novel, highly potent, synthetic
small molecule with distinctive inhibitory property
against RAS at micromolar concentration (IC50 = 2.6 μM)
in kinase assays [140]. As a farnesylcysteine mimetic,
salirasib selectively binds to and dislodges RAS from
its membrane anchorage domains, and eventually
accelerates its degradation and abrogates multiple RASdependent signaling pathways accompanied by substantial
