ABSTRACT
In a previous study, amphiphilic copolymer, polypeptide K237 (HTMYYHHYQHHL)
and folic acid (FA) modified poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (K237/
FA-PEG-PLGA) nanoparticles were developed and studied as a drug carrier. To further
promote the clinical application of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles and provide
guidance for future research, we need to examine their specific biodistribution in vivo.
In this study, K237/FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles were effectively labeled by a direct
method with Technetium-99m (99mTc) using stannous chloride as a reducing agent.
The optimal stability of the labeled nanoparticles was determined by evaluating their
radiochemical purity in serum, physiological saline, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
(DTPA) and cysteine solutions. The affinity of ligands and receptors was elicited by
cell binding and blocking experiments in KDR/folate receptor high expressing SKOV-3
ovarian cancer cells. The nanoparticles biodistribution was studied after intravenous
administration in healthy mice xenografted with SKOV-3 cells. A higher percent
injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) was observed in liver, kidney, spleen,
blood and tumor at 3 and 9 h post-injection. Scintigraphic images revealed that the
radioactivity was mainly concentrated in tumor, liver, kidney and bladder; and in the
heart, lung, and muscle was significantly lower at 3 h. The radioactivity distribution in
the images is consistent with the in vivo biodistribution data. Our works demonstrated
that K237/FA-PEG-PLGA nanoparticles have great potential as biodegradable drug
carriers, especially for tumors expressing the folate and KDr receptor.

used to prepare nanoparticles (NPs) which can serve as
favorable carriers for the delivery of certain drugs [1–4].
In this delivery system, the covalent conjugation of K237
and FA to the NPs confers them the ability to actively bind
the KDR receptor and folate receptor (FR). Binding to the
receptors leads to a greater uptake of the NPs by KDR/FRoverexpressing tumor cells while virtually ignoring normal
tissues, thereby, increasing tumor cell specificity, greatly
enhancing antitumor efficacy, and dramatically reducing
potentially dangerous side effects [5–8]. Polyethylene
glycol (PEG) functions as the outer corona and prolongs the
circulation time of the NPs in blood by reducing non-specific
interactions with blood components [9–17]. The PLGA
hydrophobic component serves as a reservoir for lipophilic
drug, while the anionic component provides the ability to
strong electrostatic interaction with cationic drugs [18, 19].
However, the biodistribution of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs
has not yet been specifically and quantized studied in ovarian
cancer model by using radioisotope 99mTc. Accordingly, we
used the radioisotope 99mTc to label the delivery system and
study the distribution of radioactivity in various tissues
following administration of the labelled NPs by performing
gamma imaging of the whole body at predetermined time
point.

amounts of stannous chloride could lead to formation
of radioactive colloids which are undesirable, while
lower amounts of stannous chloride could lead to poor
labeling efficiency. The influence of stannous chloride
on the labeling efficiency and the R/H of 99mTc is shown
in Table  1. In this study, the aim was to determine the
optimal amount of stannous chloride required for higher
labeling efficiency with lower free 99mTc and R/H of
99m
Tc. The study found that 20 μg was the optimal amount
required for all NPs preparations. The optimal pH value
and incubation time of the NPs, which can obtain high
labeling efficiency, was 7.0 and 15 min, respectively. To
optimize the above parameters, quality control tests were
performed by TLC using ITLC strips.

Stability of labeled NPs in vitro
The 99mTc-labeled NPs were assessed for their
stability in vitro after incubation with healthy human serum
and 0.9% NaCl solutions. These conditions were selected
to mimic the in vivo internal environment, physiological
pH, in vitro storage and applied environment. The human
serum contains many kinds of proteins which can chelate
and bind to 99mTc, affect the stability of the labeled NPs in
blood when the labeled NPs are injected intravenously. If
the labeled NPs were stable in serum, markers can be used
for in vivo biodistribution studies.
The labeling efficiency of the three kinds of NPs,
namely LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30 and 80/20, in a 0.9% NaCl
solution was 95.1%, 94.26%, 93.03%, respectively, at
4 h, and 89.74%, 90.63%, 90.05%, respectively, at 24 h
(Figure 2A). The labeling efficiency in serum was 94.28%,
94.67%, 93.95%, respectively, at 4 h, and 88.94%,
89.53%, 88.31%, respectively, at 24 h (Figure 2B). These
results indicate that the three kinds of NPs were quite
stable in serum and normal saline within 24 h.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Physics characterization of NPs
The K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs have a rigid structure
due to ionic interaction among the base amino groups at
the amino-terminus of PEG-PLGA. The mean diameter of
the K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30, 80/20)
NPs was 128.7 ± 13.9, 114.6 ± 10.3, and 104.2 ± 9.6 nm,
respectively, and the ζ potential was −23.53 ± 2.79,
−18.71  ± 1.84, and −16.91 ± 2.08 mV, respectively.
Meantime, the polydispersity was 0.18 ± 0.03, 0.17 ± 0.03
and 0.14 ± 0.02. respectively. The mean size and
polydispersity index values indicate the narrow size and
homogenous distributions of the particles. The ζ potential
values indicate the stability of the nanodispersions. The
presence of PEG chains in the outer shell layer was used
to improve the stability and biocompatibility of the NPs
[20–23]. A TEM photograph, presented in Figure 1, shows
that the NPs were approximately round, smooth, uniform
size and exhibited no agglomeration. And there were not
obvious changes after 99mTc label NPs.

DTPA and cysteine challenge
The strength of the 99mTc binding to NPs in 99mTclabeled NPs was tested with 10, 30, 50 mM of DTPA
or cysteine, which may indirectly confirm that no transchelation of the metal occurred in such physiological
environment. The results indicated that the labeling
efficiency of the NPs was not altered much in presence
of DTPA (Figure 3A) or cysteine (Figure 3B). Indeed,
an evaluation of these results revealed that only 1%–2%
transchelation occurred when incubated with 10 mM of
DTPA or cysteine; while incubation for 1 h with 50 mM
of DTPA or cysteine, the transchelation was only around
4–5% with DTPA and less than 4% with cysteine,
indicating the high stability of the labeled NPs.

Radiolabeling of NPs with 99mTc
The NPs were labeled with 99mTc with a high
labeling efficiency by a direct method. In the labeling
process, the amount of stannous chloride and pH value
were critical factors influencing labeling efficiency. The
amount of stannous chloride affected the ratio of reduced/
hydrolyzed (R/H) 99mTc and free 99mTc. Thus, higher

The results of the binding specificity tests indicated that the
binding of the 99mTc-labeled NPs to FR-expressing cells was
receptor-mediated, because the receptors could be blocked
and their saturation by pre-incubation with an excess of FA
can significantly decreased the binding of the radiolabeled
NPs. However, the amount of the free 99mTcO4- binding to
cells was negligible. The cell-associated immune activity
of the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30,
80/20) NPs binding to the SKOV-3 cell line was 31.75%,
32.79% and 34.01%, respectively. The highest specific
binding rate of the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA
= 60/40, 70/30, 80/20) NPs binding to SKOV-3 cells was
32.28%, 34.13%, 36.72%, respectively. Additionally, the
total and specific binding rates declined with a decrease
of the density of the SKOV-3 cells. These results indicate
that the labeled NPs have good bioactivity and specificity.
Specifically, the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA =
80/20) NPs have the best bioactivation and specificify of
the three kinds of NPs evaluated, although the difference
was not statistically significant.

in the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). The low level
of radioactivity detected in the stomach suggests that the
release of 99mTc in vivo was negligible. The high radioactivity
in kidney, indicates that the 99mTc-labeled NPs were mainly
metabolized through the urinary system. Meanwhile, the
high radioactivity detected in blood, reveals the long cycle
effects of the NPs, and suggests that it may be better to target
tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention effect
(EPR) and the binding of ligand and receptor.
γ-Camera imaging
The scintigraphic images of the 99mTc-K237/FA-PEGPLGA (LA/GA =80/20) NPs were acquired at 3 and 9 h
(Figure 4) after tail vein injection, and confirmed the results
of the biodistribution experiments. These images reveal the
high level of radioactivity accumulation in tumor, liver,
kidney and bladder. The results of the region of interest
(ROI), show that the T/NT of tumor and contralateral
muscle conforms to the biodistribution experiments. The
uptake of radioactivity by the bone marrow of the mice
injected with 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA =
80/20) NPs was low. Additionally, compared with the
radioactivity accumulation at 3 h, after 9 h of the tail vein
administration of the labeled NPs, the distribution in vivo
was the same as the 3 h and the radioactivity was decreased
in the liver, kidney, bladder and tumor.

In vivo studies
Biodistribution studies
Data on the comparative biodistribution of the 99mTclabeled NPs in male BALB/c nu/nu mice xenografted with
SKOV-3 cells at 3, and 9 h are presented in Table 5. The
average radioactivity in the liver, and spleen, was 23.1
and 13.28%, respectively, at 3 h, and 6.50 and 2.45%,
respectively, at 9 h. The 99mTc- K237/FA-PEG-PLGA
(LA/GA = 80/20) NPs were found to be mainly concentrated

CONCLUSIONS
K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs with narrow size and
homogenous distribution were successfully prepared using
the W/O and solvent evaporation method. The NPs loaded

with drug were also prepared using a similar method
[24]. These approaches can be an alternative to improve
the stability and solubility of drug, while enhancing the
absorption and bioavailability of the loaded-drug by
tumors. The K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs were labeled with
99m
Tc using a rapid and simple direct labeling procedure
to achieve high labeling efficiency and stability within 24
h. Relatively high radioactivity were observed in blood,
liver, kidney and tumor after i.v. administration, and high
retention in blood were advantageous to increase the
loaded-drug residence time. Scintigraphic images showed
that the maximum uptake occurred in liver, kidney and
tumor. In conclusion, the NPs could be a potential ideal
drug delivery system (DDS) to improve the efficacy of
the loaded-drug and reduce drug-associated toxic and side
effects during cancer treatment.

Co, Ltd, China). The resulting emulsion was rotated
and evaporated under 0.5 MPa and 37°C. After 30 min,
the emulsion was stirred gently at room temperature to
evaporate the left organic solvent. Finally, the NPs were
isolated by centrifugation at 15000 rpm, at 4°C for 30 min,
and the pelleted NPs were freeze dried [32, 33].

Physical characterization
The particle size and zeta potential (ζ) of the K237/
FA-PEG-PLGA NPs were characterized using a ZetaSizer
Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK). The
average diameters and size distribution parameters of the
NPs were obtained by dynamic light scattering. The ζ was
determined under a He-Ne laser beam at a wavelength of
633.8 nm at room temperature.
The morphology of the NPs was examined with
an H-800 transmission electron microscope (TEM) from
Hitachi Ltd., (Tokyo, Japan). The samples were prepared
by depositing 10 μL of NPs suspension on a 200 mesh,
copper grid with a formvar film, and then air-drying at

Synthesis of the K237/FA-PEG-PLGA polymer

Radiolabeling of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs
with 99mTc

The synthesis of the K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/
GA  = 60/40, 70/30, 80/20) polymer (Mw 12,000) has
been described in detail elsewhere [28–31], following the
steps depicted in Scheme 1. In brief, (1) the hydroxylterminated PEG-PLGA was synthesized; (2) the hydroxyl
end-group was then converted to Boc-L-Phe; (3) the
t-Butoxycarbonyl end-group was removed, followed
by the synthesis of the amino-terminated PEG-PLGA;
(4) the amino-terminated PEG-PLGA (200 μmol) was
dissolved in DMSO (60 mL), then mixed with NHS
(1,000 μmol), DIC (1,000 μmol), K237 (500 μmol) and
FA (500 μmol) at 37°C. Following 24 hours incubation,
the solution was mixed with 200 mL of distilled water
and centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was
then collected, dialyzed and freeze-dried. The obtained
product was dissolved in DMSO and the concentration
of the conjugated k237/FA was determined. Various
concentrations of K237/FA in DMSO were used as
reference.

Radiolabeling of the NPs was performed by a direct
method using stannous chloride as a reducing agent. The
effect of the amount of NPs and stannous chloride, the
final pH of the preparation and the incubation time on the
labeling efficiency was previously optimized by changing
a parameter at a time and by performing quality-control
tests for the labeled complex as described earlier [38]. The
amount of stannous chloride required for high labeling
efficiency and low radio colloids was optimized in
preliminary experiments, whereby it was determined that
a range of 20 to 100 μg of stannous chloride was optimal
and thus was used in further experiments. Similarly to
achieve optimal labeling efficiency, the amount of NPs,
the pH of the reaction mixture and the incubation time
were also investigated. Eventually, the most appropriate
labeling protocol was found and can be described as
follows. Briefly, 250 μL of NPs dispersion (2 mg/mL)
were mixed separately with 20 μg of stannous chloride
(40 mg/mL). After adjusting the pH of the mixture to
7.0 with sodium hydrogen carbonate (0.5 M), 50 μL of
a 99mTcO4- solution (0.74–3.7 GBq), freshly eluted from
a 99Mo-99mTc generator (Drytec, GE Healthcare), was
added to each preparation, mixed gentle, and incubated
for 15  min at room temperature. Final radioactivity
concentration present in the preparation was examined
using a well-type gamma ray spectrometer (Cobra II
Inspector 5003; Canberra Packard Central Europe GmbH,
Romania) [39].

Preparation of K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs
The K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs were prepared using
a water in oil (W/O) emulsion method. Briefly, 4 mg of
K237/FA-PEG-PLGA were dissolved in 200 μL of ethyl
acetate, followed by the addition of 2.0 ml of deionized
water containing 1% (W/W) of F68. Subsequently,
the mixture was homogenized and emulsified by
ultrasonication (400 W, 6 times × 10s) with a JY 92-II

volume proportion of 3:5:1.5. The reduced/hydrolyzed
99m
Tc present in the preparation remains at the point of
application, while both the free 99mTc and labeled NPs
migrate to the front with the solvent front [38]. The
labeling efficiency was calculated by using the following
equation:
Labeling efficiency (%) = [Bacetone/(T+B)acetone – Tpyridine/
(T+B) pyridine] × 100%. Where, T and B are the radioactivity
counts at the top and bottom of the strip, respectively.

The labeling efficiency of the NPs was determined
by ascending thin layer chromatography (TLC) using
instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) strips coated
with silica gel and the test temperature was 25°C. The
ITLC strips were used to determine the free 99mTc and
percentage of radio colloids in the preparation. Based
on these two parameters, the labeling efficiency of the
preparation was calculated [40].
ITLC strips were spotted with 2~3 μL labeled
complex at 1 cm above the bottom. These strips were
advanced by using acetone as the mobile phase to
determine the percentage of the labeled complex and
a solvent (Vpyridine: Vacetic acid: Vwater = 3:5:1.5) as the
mobile phase to determine free 99mTc and labeled NPs.
The solvent front was allowed to reach to a height
of approximately 6 to 8 cm from the origin. The
radioactivity in the strip of Rf value = 0.1 to 1.0 was
determined by well-type gamma ray spectrometer. The
free 99mTc present in the preparation migrates to the top
portion (Rf value about 0.8 to 1.0) of the ITLC strip,
leaving the labeled NPs along with the radio colloids
(reduced/hydrolyzed 99mTc) at the application point when
using acetone as the mobile phase. The presence of
radio colloids was determined by developing the ITLC
strip using a solution of pyridine: acetic acid: water in

Stability of labeled complexes
The stability of the 99mTc-labeled NPs was evaluated
in vitro in human serum and normal saline by the
ascending TLC technique. The freshly labeled complex
(10 μL) was incubated with freshly collected human serum
(90 μL) at 37°C. Following incubations for 1 h, 4 h, 9 h
and 24 h, the samples were separated by ITLC using the
above mentioned solvent systems.

DTPA and cysteine challenge
The in vitro stability studies of 99mTc-labeled NPs
were performed using DTPA and cysteine as previously
reported [24]. Briefly, fresh DTPA and cysteine solutions
(10, 30, 50 mM, each) were prepared in 0.9% NaCl
solutions. A 500 μL volume of the labeled NPs was

incubated with the different concentrations of DTPA
and cysteine for 1h at 37 oC, while a 500 μL of 0.9%
NaCl solution served as control. The effect of DTPA
and cysteine on the labeling efficiency of the prepared
complexes was analyzed by ITLC-silica gel strips using
acetone as mobile phase. In this acetone system, the
99m
Tc-labeled NPs remain at the point of application
(Rf = 0.0), while free pertechnetate (Rf = 0.8–1.0) and
all known chemical forms of 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTccysteine complexes migrate upward (Rf = 0.7–1.0). After
developing, each paper was cut into two halves, the top
and bottom halves, and radioactivity in each half was
measured using a gamma-ray spectrometer [41, 42].

SKOV-3 cells (1 × 106) were implanted in the right hind
leg of immunodeficient mice [50–52]. Additionally,
3.7 MBq of 99mTc-labeled K237/FA-PEG-PLGA
(LA/GA = 80/20) NPs in 150 μL of normal saline were
administered into the mice tail vein. At 3 h and 9 h postinjection mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and
tissue were dissected for measurement of biodistribution
and tumor targeting. The radioactivity associated with the
blood, heart, liver, kidney, tumor, lung, spleen, stomach,
muscle, and bone tissues were examined with a gamma
counter, together with a standard radioactive solution of
known quantity administered at the time of each injection,
which was considered as 100%. The radioactivity present
in each tissue sample was expressed as percent injected
dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) (n = 6) [53, 54].

Cell binding and blocking experiments in vitro
The specificity of the 99mTc-labeled NPs for receptor
was assessed in vitro. SKOV-3 cells in the logarithmic
phase of proliferation, 80–90% confluency, were detached
with trypsin and resuspended at a cell concentration of
5 × 106, 1 × 106, 5 × 105, 1 × 105, 5 × 104, 1 × 104 cells/mL.
A volume of 1 mL of cell suspension was transferred into
a centrifuge tube, then 1.5 μg (0.37-2.22 MBq, 100 μL)
of 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs in DMEM solution
was added to each tube, followed by incubation for 1 h
at 37°C, before the radioactivity count (T) was measured.
Cells were collected by centrifugation (3000 rpm/min)
for 10 min, at 4°C, washed twice with PBS (0.01 mol/L,
pH = 7.4), and then the radioactivity of the combination
with SKOV-3 cells (B) was measured. Meanwhile, nonspecific binding assay was performed as above described.
A total of 191 μg of FA (equivalent to 1000 times,
compared with FA in 1.5 μg nanoparticles) were added
to the different cell samples, followed by the addition
of the same amount of 99mTc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA NPs
after incubation for 45 min at 37°C. After 1 h, the samples
were centrifuged (3000 rpm/min) for 10 min, cells were
collected and wash twice with PBS (0.01 mol/L, pH = 7.4),
and then the radioactivity was measured. The specific cells
binding rate (%) = the mean of total cells binding rate
(B/T) −the mean of non-specific cells binding rate [43–46].
The cells binding rate of the 99mTcO4− was determined as
follows: a 100 μL (0.37–2.22 MBq) of 99mTcO4− solution
was added to the cells suspension solution, then the other
steps were as described above.

γ-Camera imaging

In vivo studies

The work was supported by the funding from
Wenzhou Science & Technology Bureau (No. Y20150049)
and NSFC projects (No. 81602727 and No. 81501483).

In vivo imaging was performed to obtain a visual
confirmation of the biodistribution data. The SKOV-3
xenograft-bearing mice were injected with 100 μCi of
99m
Tc-K237/FA-PEG-PLGA (LA/GA = 80/20) NPs. Before
imaging, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 18.75
mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride and 0.5 mg/kg medetomidine
hydrochloride. The accumulation of radioactivity in mice
was monitored by imaging with a γ-camera (GE Healthcare,
Cleveland, OH, USA) equipped with a low-energy highresolution collimator. Static images were obtained by a
512×512 matrix and a pixel side length of 0.4 mm, resulting
in a total imaging time of 757 seconds. [55–58]

Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using the
SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
All results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD) for the values obtained from a minimum of three
independent experiments. All statistical analyses involving
comparisons of multiple groups were performed using the
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post
hoc test. All tests were considered statistically significant
when the P value was less than 0.05.
