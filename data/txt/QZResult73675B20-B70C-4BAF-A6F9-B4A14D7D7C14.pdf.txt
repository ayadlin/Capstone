Abstract
Hexavalent Chromium [Cr(VI)] compounds are human lung carcinogens
and environmental/occupational hazards. The molecular mechanisms of Cr(VI)
carcinogenesis appear to be complex and are poorly defined. In this study, we
investigated the potential role of Gene 33 (ERRFI1, Mig6), a multifunctional adaptor
protein, in Cr(VI)-mediated lung carcinogenesis. We show that the level of Gene 33
protein is suppressed by both acute and chronic Cr(VI) treatments in a dose- and
time-dependent fashion in BEAS-2B lung epithelial cells. The inhibition also occurs in
A549 lung bronchial carcinoma cells. Cr(VI) suppresses Gene 33 expression mainly
through post-transcriptional mechanisms, although the mRNA level of gene 33 also
tends to be lower upon Cr(VI) treatments. Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage appears
primarily in the S phases of the cell cycle despite the high basal DNA damage signals
at the G2M phase. Knockdown of Gene 33 with siRNA significantly elevates Cr(VI)induced DNA damage in both BEAS-2B and A549 cells. Depletion of Gene 33 also
promotes Cr(VI)-induced micronucleus (MN) formation and cell transformation in
BEAS-2B cells. Our results reveal a novel function of Gene 33 in Cr(VI)-induced DNA
damage and lung epithelial cell transformation. We propose that in addition to its role
in the canonical EGFR signaling pathway and other signaling pathways, Gene 33 may
also inhibit Cr(VI)-induced lung carcinogenesis by reducing DNA damage triggered
by Cr(VI).

INTRODUCTION

oncogenes or tumor suppressors [2]. The genotoxic effect
of Cr(VI) is more likely represented by genomic instability
in forms of chromosome instability and/or microsatellite
instability [5]. Epigenetic effects of Cr(VI) which lead
to altered histone methylation, histone acetylation, and
DNA methylation have also been reported and believed
to play significant roles in lung carcinogenesis [11, 12].
Despite these previous efforts, the specific mechanisms,
particularly the specific intracellular molecular mediators
of Cr(VI) carcinogenesis, remain poorly defined.
DNA damage triggers phosphorylation of histone
H2AX at Ser139 (γH2AX) by The ATM family protein
kinases as part of the DNA damage response [13-15].
Generation of γH2AX is considered a hallmark of DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs), the most detrimental form
of DNA damage [16, 17]. The DNA damage response
serves to initiate DNA repair or, in case of irreparable
DNA damage, to eliminate cells carrying the damage

Cr(VI) compounds are well documented human
lung carcinogens [1-3]. Occupational exposure, mainly
through inhalation, during industrial processes such as
chrome plating, stainless steel production, and chrome
pigment manufacturing are the main sources of human
contact with Cr(VI) [1-3]. Cr(VI) is a genotoxic agent
that induces DNA damage [2, 4-8]. The toxic effect of
Cr(VI) is believed to be a result of oxidative stresses
generated during its reduction process [7]. Exposure of
cells to Cr(VI) provokes a typical DNA damage response
that leads to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence
[4-6, 8-10]. Interestingly, despite the ability of forming
potentially mutagenic Cr(III)-DNA ternary adducts during
its intracellular reduction process [9], Cr(VI) appears to be
a weak mutagen [5]. Consistently, lung cancers associated
with Cr(VI) exposure exhibit few mutations of the key

through apoptosis or senescence [13-15]. Improper DNA
repair can lead to genomic instability, characterized by
DNA mutations and/or chromosome instability [18]. It
is conceivable that cellular components that affect the
generation or repair of DNA damage can have important
impact on genomic stability and carcinogenesis.
Gene 33 is an inducible adaptor protein containing
multiple domains for protein-protein interaction and
signal transduction [19, 20]. The most significant function
of Gene 33 characterized thus far is to bind to the kinase
domain of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases thereby
inhibiting their kinase activities and the downstream
signaling pathways [20-22]. Gene 33 can also induce
apoptosis by activating the protein tyrosine kinase cAbl
and inhibiting the ErbB-PI3K-AKT survival pathway [23,
24]. Gene 33 may contribute to replicative and oncogeneinduced cell senescence through its inhibition of the
EGFR signaling [25]. Gene 33 has also been shown to
regulate cell migration through the HGF/c-Met signaling
pathway [26]. Thus, Gene 33 regulates multiple signaling
pathways that are important for tumorigenesis and tumor
progression [27].
Increasing evidence supports a role of Gene 33
as a bona fide tumor suppressor in the lung. Nonsense
or missense mutations of gene 33 (errfi1) have been
detected in lung cancers [28]. Reduced or loss of Gene
33 expression has been reported in significant number of
human lung cancer samples and cell lines [28, 29]. Gene
33 null mice tend to develop spontaneous lung adenoma
and adenocarcinoma [28, 30]. Gene 33 is located at
chromosome 1p36.32 where loss of heterozygosity occurs
frequently in lung cancer and associated with tobacco
smoking [31].
Despite these findings, an assessment of its
role in lung carcinogenesis in response to a relevant
environmental lung carcinogen has not been conducted.
Here we report that Gene 33 protein expression can be
significantly suppressed by Cr(VI) in both lung epithelial
(BEAS-2B) and lung cancer (A549) cells through both
transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.
Cr(VI) induces a DNA damage response, which occurs
mainly in the S phase of the cell cycle. Knockdown
of Gene 33 by siRNA elevates the Cr(VI)-induced
DNA damage in BEAS-2B cells, which led to elevated
micronucleus formation and cell transformation. Our
data reveal a novel function of Gene 33 in regulating
Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage and a potential involvement
of this protein in Cr(VI)-mediated genotoxicity and
carcinogenesis.

Cr(VI) suppresses Gene 33 expression
As reduced expression of tumor suppressor proteins
is often associated with tumorigenesis, we checked
whether the expression of tumor suppressor protein Gene
33 is regulated by Cr(VI). We treated BEAS-2B cells
with different concentrations of Cr(VI)(we used Na2CrO4
throughout the study) for different periods of time. We
observed that Cr(VI) suppressed the protein level of Gene
33 in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, with significant
inhibition started at 1μM and 24 hours, respectively
(Figure 1A, 1B, 1C). A dose-dependent increase of
γH2AX was also observed with significant elevation at
2μM (Figure 1A). The activation of γH2AX indicates
that Cr(VI) induces DNA damage in the form of DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs), confirming the previously
published observations [4, 6, 10, 32]. Figure 1D shows
that Cr(VI) could further inhibit Gene 33 expression after
Gene 33 knockdown by RNAi. Cr(VI) also inhibited Gene
33 expression in A549 cells (Figure 1E). In both BEAS2B and A549 cells Gene 33 could be induced by bringing
FBS content to 20% in normal DMEM (Figure 1D &
1E), consistent with the finding that Gene 33 is a mitogen
inducible protein [20, 24]. We further examined whether
long term exposure to low concentrations of Cr(VI) also
affects the level of Gene 33 protein. We treated BEAS-2B
cells with 0.25 or 0.5 μM Cr(VI), two sub-lethal doses of
Cr(VI) to BEAS-2B cells [33], for 2 months followed by
checking the levels of Gene 33 protein. As shown in Figure
1F, Cr(VI) treatments led to a dose-dependent reduction of
Gene 33 protein levels in these cells. Collectively, our data
demonstrate that the Gene 33 protein level is suppressible
by Cr(VI) in lung epithelial and lung cancer cells.

Gene 33 expression is regulated at multiple levels
by Cr(VI)
We next studied how Cr(VI) regulates Gene 33
expression. It is well documented that Cr(VI) generates
the oxidative stress, which is likely the root cause of its
toxicity [7]. We therefore checked whether suppression of
the oxidative stress affects the level of Gene 33 protein.
We find that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a free radical
scavenger, prevented the Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of the
Gene 33 protein level at both 24 and 48 hours after Cr (VI)
and NAC co-treatments. (Figure 2A). This result indicates
that the inhibition of the Gene 33 protein level was caused
by Cr(VI)-mediated generation of oxidative stresses rather
than by direct action of Cr(VI). Of note, NAC alone was
able to strongly inhibit Gene 33 expression (Figure 2A,
NAC group). This would indicate that constitutive level
of expression of this gene, in untreated cells, is facilitated

Gene 33 is an inducible protein whose expression
is tightly controlled by mitogenic and stress signals [19,
20]. In addition, Gene 33 contains two PEST domains
suggesting that the ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated protein
degradation mechanism may be involved in regulating the
Gene 33 level [19, 20]. To explore this, we used MG132,
an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome [34], to examine
whether the proteasome-mediated protein degradation
pathway plays a role in the observed reduction of Gene 33
protein level upon Cr(VI) treatments. As expected, MG132
was able to significantly raise the basal Gene 33 protein
level in BEAS-2B cells (Figure 2B). However, MG132

only modestly reversed the effect of Cr(VI) on Gene 33
expression (Figure 2B). These data indicate that while
Gene 33 is indeed subject to regulation by proteasomemediated pathway, the inhibition of Gene 33 expression by
Cr(VI) can only be partially attributed to this mechanism.
To further test this notion, we ectopically co-overexpressed
FLAG-tagged Gene 33 with ubiquitin in BEAS-2B cells
to see whether the ectopically expressed Gene 33 can be
ubiquitinated by ectopically expressed ubiquitin. Indeed,
as shown in Figure 2C, Gene 33 was ubiquitinated by
ectopically expressed ubiquitin, as indicated by higher
molecular weight proteins detected by anti-Gene 33
antibody. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome by MG132

elevated the level of Gene 33 ubiquitination (Figure 2C).
Consistently, the Gene 33 protein level was strongly
elevated by MG132. These data confirm that Gene 33 is
indeed subjected to regulation by ubiquitin-proteasome
system. However, albeit more modest compared to the
endogenous Gene 33, Cr(VI) could still suppress the level
of ectopically expressed Gene 33 protein with or without
the presence of MG132, confirming that the proteasomemediated pathway may only partially responsible for
the suppression. Moreover, Cr(VI) strongly reduced the
level of ubiquitinated Gene 33 and inhibition of the 26S
proteasome by MG132 did not significantly reverse this
reduction (Figure 2C). These data are against the notion
that Cr(VI) destabilizes the Gene 33 protein by enhancing
its ubiquitination. Instead, they appears to suggest that

Cr(VI) either activates a mechanism independent of the
26S proteasome system to degrade the ubiquitinated Gene
33 or Cr(VI) serves as a activator of the 26S proteasome
that can partially overcomes the inhibitory effect of
MG132, or both.
As expected, ectopic expression of ubiquitin led to
strong global ubiquitination of cellular proteins, showing
as strong ubiquitin signals detected by the FLAG antibody
(Figure 2D). Inhibition of the 26S proteasome by MG132
strongly enhanced the global level of ubiquitination
(Figure 2D). Of note, Cr(VI) appears to reduce the global
ubiquitination with and without presence of MG132
(Figure 2D). These data are consistent with above
prediction that Cr(VI) activates an alternative mechanism
or the 26S proteasome itself in a MG132-independent

fashion that degrades at least some ubiquitinated proteins.
It appears that endogenous Gene 33 was more
strongly inhibited by Cr(VI) than the ectopically expressed
one (compare Figure 1 with Figure 2C). This suggests that
transcriptional or other post-transcriptional mechanisms
may also be involved in the regulation of the expression of
the endogenous Gene 33. We therefore accessed whether
Gene 33 is regulated by Cr(VI) at the mRNA level. Using
real-Time PCR, we observed that Cr(VI) has a tendency to
modestly inhibit the Gene 33 mRNA level in both BEAS2B and A549 cells, although significant inhibition only
occurred at certain time points after treatments (Figure 2E
and 2F).
Given the relatively weak effect of Cr(VI) on Gene
33 mRNA, we searched for other potential mechanisms.
Gene 33 has been shown to be regulated by microRNAs,
specifically miR-200 and miR-148 [35, 36]. We used
TargetScan to search for potential microRNA targets on

the 3’UTR of the Gene mRNA. As shown in Figure 2G,
multiple potential targets for miR-200 family microRNAs
present at the 3’UTR of Gene 33 mRNA, including those
for miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-429. We then measured
the expression of miR-200b and miR-200c in BEAS-2B
cells in response to Cr(VI) using real-Time PCR. We find
that miR-200c but not miR-200b was modestly induced
by Cr(VI) (Figure 2H and 2I), suggesting that miR-200c
may contribute to suppression of Gene 33 by Cr(VI).
To confirm this observation, we transfected a miR-200c
inhibitor (Life Technologies) to see whether inhibition of
miR-200c would overcome the suppression of Gene 33
by Cr(VI). Surprisingly, while miR-200c strongly elevated
the level of Gene 33 protein, it failed to overcome the
inhibition by Cr(VI). These data indicate that the basal
level of Gene 33 is indeed regulated by miR-200c but
its suppression by Cr(VI) is not mediated by the modest
induction of miR-200c in response to Cr(VI). Taken

cancer cells Gene 33 expression are regulated by Cr(VI)
through a combination of mRNA expression, protein
degradation, and possibly other unidentified translational/
post translational mechanisms.

generates a peak γH2AX response at within 2 hours
[17, 37]. These results are consistent with the notion
that Cr(VI) induces DNA damage indirectly through
generation of oxidative stresses [7].
We next used Laser Scanning Cytometry (LSC)
to further examine the effect of Cr(VI) on the DNA
damage response in BEAS-2B cells. We observed that
Cr(VI) had relatively weak effect on the γH2AX level
at all Cr(VI) concentrations at 2 hour treatment while
produced strong response at 6 hour (Figure 3B and 3C).
In contrast, Camptothecin, a chemotherapeutic drug
that inhibits Topoisomerase I (used as a positive control
to detect H2AX phosphorylation) [37, 38], strongly
increased the γH2AX level at both 2 and 6 hours (Figure
3B and 3C). These data confirm our results using Western
blot (Figure 3A). We also simultaneously measured the
phosphorylation level of p53 at serine 15 (P-p53) in these
experiments. Interestingly, there was a dose-dependent

Cr(VI) induces DNA damage responses
Cr(VI) has been shown to induce DNA damage [28]. To confirm this, we treated BEAS-2B cells with Cr(VI)
and checked the level of γH2AX, a hallmark of DSBs
[17], using Western blot. We find that the level of γH2AX
was significant elevated upon Cr(VI) treatment for 6 and
24 hours (Figure 3A). In contrast, 2 hour Cr(VI) treatment
generate minimal amount of γH2AX. This time course is
significantly slower than a typical chemotherapeutic drug
that interferes with the DNA replication process, which

reduction of P-p53 for the 2 hour treatment compared to
a general increase for the 6 hour treatment, except at the
20 μM concentration (Figure 3B and 3C). The differential
behavior between γH2AX and P-p53 may reflect the fact
that serine 15 of p53 is a target of a more diverse spectrum
of kinases while H2AX is mainly phosphorylated by the
ATM family kinases that are directly associated with DNA
damage [16].
Further analysis of the data on the 6 hour treatment
by separating different phases of the cell cycle reveals that
γH2AX mainly presented at the S and G2/M phases of
the cell cycle (Figure 3D). However, the dose-dependent
increases in γH2AX were much more pronounced for cells
in G1 and S phases than those in G2M phase (Figure 3D),
indicating that Cr(VI)-induced DSBs mainly occur in the
S and apparent the G1 phases of the cell cycle. However,
we believe that the apparent strong induction of DSBs
in cells of G1 phase actually caused by cells entering S
phase (see Discussion). In contrast to γH2AX, the dosedependent changes in P-p53 were similar among different
phases (Figure 3E). Cr(VI) treatment also led to cell cycle
arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle in a dose-dependent
fashion (Figure 3F). Figure 3G shows sample readouts of
LSC.

treatments (Figure 4D). In addition, we could hardly detect
the P-p53 signal in A549 cells with or without Cr(VI)
treatment (Figure 4D). These data suggest that A549 may
be more resistant to Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage than
BEAS-2B cells. We also find that Gene 33 knockdown
alone had limited effect on cell cycle progression of
BEAS-2B cells under normal growth condition (Figure
4E and 4F). Collectively, our data indicate that Gene 33
inhibits Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage in lung epithelial
and lung cancer cells.

Gene 33 ablation enhances Cr(VI)-induced
micronucleus formation
Cr(VI) has been shown to induce chromosome
instability in form of micronucleus formation in both
cellular and animal models [32, 40]. Since Cr(VI) is
considered a weak mutagen, induction of chromosome
instability is believed to be the main mechanism leading
to genomic instability and carcinogenesis [5]. Given
the effect of Gene 33 on Cr(VI) induced DNA damage
we wanted to examine whether Gene 33 affects Cr(VI)induced formation of micronuclei, an indication of
DNA damage-induced chromosome instability [41].
We transiently knocked down Gene 33 with siRNA in
BEAS-2B cells and assessed its effect on the level of
micronucleus formation induced by Cr(VI). The result
shows that the combination of Gene 33 knockdown and
Cr(VI) treatment led to statistically significant increase in
the MN level (Figure 5A). Figure 5B and 5C show Gene
33 knockdown by siRNA and examples of MN. Our data
are in line with the notion that Gene 33 regulates Cr(VI)induced DNA damage that lead to chromosome instability
in lung epithelial cells.

Gene 33 knockdown promotes Cr(VI)-induced
DNA damage
Given that Cr(VI) suppresses Gene 33 expression
and induces DNA damage, we checked whether Gene
33 plays a role in Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage. We
transiently knockdown Gene 33 using siRNA and
measured its effect on the Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage
response. We find that knockdown of Gene 33 in BEAS2B cells elevated the level of Cr(VI)-induced DNA
damage, as indicated by increased γH2AX signals in cells
transfected with an siRNA oligo for Gene 33 compared
to those transfected with a scrambled oligo (Figure 4A,
4B, 4C, 4D). This effect occurred after both 6 hour and 24
hour Cr(VI) treatments (Figure 4A, 4B, 4C). In contrast,
while Cr(VI) strongly induced P-p53, Gene 33 knockdown
had limited effect on this phosphorylation (Figure 4A and
4C). We also checked the activities of p38 and ERK by
measuring their phosphorylation levels as these kinases
have been implicated in the phosphorylation of p53
in response to Cr(VI) in A549 cells [39]. We find that
while Gene 33 knockdown slightly increased the level of
phospho-p38, the Cr(VI) treatments had limited effect on
it (Figure 4A). The level of phosphorylated ERK appeared
the same among different treatments (Figure 4A). A
similar effect of Gene 33 on γH2AX was also observed in
A549 cells, where Gene 33 knockdown also enhanced the
level of γH2AX in response to Cr(VI) treatment (Figure
4D). Of note, γH2AX signals in A549 cells appeared to be
weaker at both the basal level and in response to Cr(VI)

Gene 33 deletion increases Cr(VI)-induced cell
transformation
The initial biological step of lung carcinogenesis is
the malignant transformation of lung epithelial cells. Given
the effect of Gene 33 on DNA damage and chromosome
instability, it is likely that Gene 33 regulate Cr(VI)-induced
lung epithelial cell transformation. We checked how the
Gene 33 expression level affects anchorage-independent
cell growth, a hallmark of cell transformation, in BEAS2B cells using standard soft agar colony formation assay.
Cr(VI) has been well documented to be capable of
transforming BEAS-2B cells [33, 42, 43]. To confirm this,
we treated BEAS-2B cells with Cr(VI) at 0.25 and 0.5 μM
concentrations (both are sub-lethal concentrations) [33]
followed by soft agar colony formation assay as described
in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure 6A, there
were significant and dose-dependent increases in numbers
of colonies formed after Cr(VI) treatments, confirming
the previously published findings [33]. Of note, BEAS8922

2B cells are known to have a basal ability of forming
small colonies in soft agar assay [33]. We next compared
levels of Cr(VI)-induced transformation of BEAS-2B
cells with or without stable Gene 33 knockdown using
the same experimental protocol. We find that cells with
stable Gene 33 knockdown exhibited significantly higher
levels of colony formation both at the basal condition and
after Cr(VI) treatments (Figure 6C). Figure 6D shows the

significant lower level of Gene 33 expression in BEAS-2B
cell with stable Gene 33 knockdown before transformation
experiment. Our data establish that Gene 33 suppresses
Cr(VI)-induced lung epithelial cell transformation,
consistent with the observation that endogenous Gene 33
reduces DNA damage and inhibits chromosome instability
elicited by Cr(VI).

Discussion

a previously unidentified function of this protein in the
DNA damage response. We find that the Gene 33 level
can be inhibited by Cr(VI) exposure in lung epithelial and
lung cancer cells at the protein level and to a less extent
the mRNA level. We show that Gene 33 inhibits DNA
damage induced by Cr(VI). We further demonstrate that
Gene 33 inhibits Cr(VI)-induced MN formation and cell
transformation in lung epithelial cells.
Our data reveal that the root cause of the
suppression of Gene 33 by Cr(VI) is the generation of free
radicals (Figure 2A). These free radicals are apparently
able to inhibit Gene 33 at both the protein and mRNA
levels (Figures 1 and 2). The 26S proteasome system is
clearly involved in the Cr(VI) suppression of the Gene
33 protein level (Figure 2A, 2B, 2C). However, the effect
of Cr(VI) on ubiquitination of Gene 33 is interesting as
Cr(VI) inhibits rather than enhance Gene 33 ubiquitination
(Figure 2C). Cr(VI) also inhibits the ubiquitination of
many other cellular proteins (Figure 2D). These data
do not support the notion that Cr(VI) promotes Gene

The cellular effects of Cr(VI) are primarily caused
by the generation free radicals [7]. The relatively nonspecific nature of free radicals implies that Cr(VI) likely
alters multiple cellular activities, as indicated by studies
on gene expression profiles [33, 44-46]. Accordingly,
pathways that control cell proliferation, growth, survival,
autophagy, as well as DNA damage and repair have all
been shown to be part of the cellular responses to Cr(VI)
[2]. Moreover, recent studies suggest that the PI3K/AKT/
GSK3/β-catenin and the EGFR signaling pathways are
important for Cr(VI)-induced BEAS-2B lung epithelial
cell transformation [47, 48]. Given the complexity the
regulation, it is crucial to identify the molecular players
that drive Cr(VI)-induced lung carcinogenesis rather than
those associated only with the transient stress responses.
The present study provides evidence for a novel
association of the adaptor protein Gene 33 in Cr(VI)induced lung epithelial cell transformation and reveals

33 degradation by enhancing its ubiquitination. Instead,
Cr(VI) appears to suppress Gene 33 protein, at least
partially, through a ubiquitin-dependent but proteasomeindependent pathway or by activating the proteasome
itself. Further investigation into this question is clearly
needed.
The finding that inhibition of miR-200c strongly
elevates the Gene 33 protein level is consistent with
the existence of multiple consensus binding element
for miR200 and the previous findings (Figure 2G) [35].
However, we did not detect a role of miR-200c in Cr(VI)mediated suppression of Gene 33 despite the increase in
miR-200c expression upon Cr(VI) treatment (Figure 2G
and 2I).
A recent study suggests that Cr(VI)-induced DSBs
accumulate at the euchromatin region where active
transcription occurs [10]. These events likely slow down
transcription of many genes. Whether Gene 33 is one on
the genes that is suppressed by this mechanism remains to
be determined. In addition, epigenetic modifications could
also supress Gene 33 expression, especially in chronic

setting. Further research in this direction is needed.
It has been shown that Cr(VI)-induced DSBs mainly
happen at the S phase of the cell cycle as a result of the
formation of Cr(III)-DNA adducts during Cr(VI) reduction
process [2]. Our data confirm this notion. However, our
results also seem to suggest that cells in G1 phase are also
sensitive to Cr(VI)-induced DSBs. Since DNA damage
induced by genotoxic agent typically happens during DNA
replication in S phase [37], the apparent increase in the
level of γH2AX in cells in G1 phase likely reflected DNA
damage in cells entering the S phase when their DNA
content was not appreciably increased comparing to G1
cells. This is similar to the cells treated with Camptothecin
(Figure 3G), the drug that induces γH2AX exclusively
in S phase [37]. Indeed, our experiment on the effect
of Cr(VI) in A549 cells confirmed this notion (Figure
S1 and the discussion therein ). The high basal level of
γH2AX in G2/M phase observed in our experiments
was likely a result of DNA damage-independent mitotic
phosphorylation of H2AX [49, 50]. Consistently, the
γH2AX level was less affected by Cr(VI) during G2/M

Figure 7: Proposed model for Gene 33 in Cr(VI)-induced lung carcinogenesis. Cr(VI) reduces the levels of Gene 33 mRNA and

protein thereby inhibiting Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage that lead to genomic instability, cell transformation and carcinogenesis. Gene 33
may also reduce lung carcinogenesis by inhibiting lung epithelial cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, and slowing down cell migration.

phase (Figure 3D).
We find that P-p53 behaved differently between
2 hour and 6 hour treatments with Cr(VI): a dosedependent reduction vs. a dose-dependent increase except
at 20 μM (Figure 3B and 3C). These data, coupled with
those showing limited increase in the level of γH2AX in
response to Cr(VI) at 2 hours vs. strong increase in the
level of γH2AX at 6 hours, suggest that the kinase that
was responsible for the basal phosphorylation of p53 was
inhibited by Cr(VI) at the initial period of the treatment
before DNA damage occurs. Our results show that the
activities of p38 and ERK MAPK kinases, indicated
by the levels of p38 and ERK phosphorylation, were
mostly unchanged by 6 hour Cr(VI) treatment (Figure
4A). Although these two kinases have been shown to
phosphorylate p53 at Serine 15 [51], our data do not
support roles of these kinases in phosphorylation of p53
at serine 15 in response to Cr(VI). Of note, it has been
reported that ERK phosphorylates p53 at serine 15 in
response to Cr(VI) in A549 cells, albeit at a much higher
concentration (50μM)[39]. Moreover, we were unable
to detect any signal of P-p53 in A549 cells after 24 hour
treatment with 5 μM Cr(VI) (Figure 4D). Thus, a cell typeor dose-dependent discrepancy likely exists.
Our observation that depletion of Gene 33 protein
significantly elevates Cr(VI)-induced DSBs (Figure
4) suggests Gene 33 may either function to prevent
Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage or to facilitate DNA repair
following the DNA damage. We also observed that
Gene 33 depletion led to dramatically elevated levels of
ubiquitinated γH2AX upon Cr(VI) treatment (Figure 4A
and 4B), consistent with the notion that ubiquitinated
H2AX is associated with the DNA damage response [52].
Our data showing that Gene 33 can suppress Cr(VI)induced micronucleus formation and cell transformation
is consistent with the notion that Gene 33 functions to
inhibit Cr(VI)-mediated DNA damage and chromosome
instability.
The mechanism underlying the regulation of
Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage by Gene 33 is unclear. It
has been shown that EGFR translocates to the nucleus
after certain genotoxic insults and facilitates DNA repair
by activating DNA-PK and phosphorylating histone
H4 [53-55]. As Gene 33 is a well-established regulator
of the EGFR kinase activity and its internalization [21,
22, 56, 57], it is tempting to speculate that Gene 33 may
modulate EGFR nuclear translocation to and/or activity
in the nucleus thereby regulating the DNA repair process.
Our experiments indeed show that Gene 33 is capable
of affecting the interaction of EGFR with DNA-PK and
histone H4 (SP and DX, unpublished observations).
Further in-depth investigation into this mechanism is
currently underway.
The effect of Gene 33 on canonical EGFR signaling
pathway may also need to be taken into consideration
when evaluating its role in Cr(VI) carcinogenesis.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our data show that Gene 33 knockdown had limited effect
on cell cycle progression in BEAS-2B cells cultured in
medium containing 10% FBS (Figure 4E and 4F). Since
Gene 33 is a specific inhibitor of EGFR family receptor
tyrosine kinases [20-22, 58], it is conceivable that while
Gene 33 can significantly inhibit EGF-induced cell cycle
entry under serum deprivation [20], its role in cell cycle
progression in presence of 10% FBS may be limited.
However, long term increase in EGFR signaling likely
contributes to higher potential for cell transformation.
Accordingly, elevated activity of the EGFR signaling
pathway as a result of increased expression of EGFR has
been reported in Cr(VI)-transformed BEAS-2B cells [48].
The inhibition of Gene 33 expression by Cr(VI) would
be consistent with the increased EGFR expression and
EGFR signaling as Gene 33 inhibits EGFR kinase activity
and promotes EGFR degradation [57, 58]. It will be
interesting to determine whether the reduced expression
of Gene 33 contributes to the elevated EGFR signaling
in Cr(VI)-transformed lung epithelial cells. Furthermore,
the involvement of other known functions of Gene 33
in cell apoptosis, cell senescence, and cell migration in
Cr(VI)-mediated cell transformation and tumorigenesis
also warrants further investigation.
Taken together, the present study implicates Gene 33
as an important player in Cr(VI)-induced lung epithelial
transformation and lung carcinogenesis. Although these
findings are confirmative of the previous view that Gene
33 is a tumor suppressor protein, this is the first study
linking Gene 33 to potential lung malignancy induced
by an environmental and occupational carcinogen. In
addition, we explored the mechanism underlying the
suppression of Gene 33 expression by Cr(VI). Moreover,
we have identified a novel association of Gene 33 with
Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage. We propose a model on
the potential role of Gene 33 in Cr(VI)-induced lung
carcinogenesis: 1. Cr(VI) inhibits Gene 33 expression
at both mRNA and protein levels. 2. Gene 33 inhibits
Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage, genomic instability, cell
neoplastic transformation, and likely carcinogenesis. 3.
This mechanism, together with other functions of Gene
33 in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell migration,
constitutes the overall role of Gene 33 in Cr(VI)-induced
lung carcinogenesis (Figure 7).

Materials and methods
Cell lines, antibodies, and plasmids
BEAS-2B human lung bronchial epithelial cells
and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (100 unit/ml of

Real-time PCR

penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate per
mL) under 5% CO2 condition. The antibody to Gene 33
has been described previously [20, 24]. The antibody
to γH2AX was purchased from Biolegend. Antibodies
to GAPDH, EGFR, and β-actin were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody to P-p53 (S15)
was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The
mammalian expression plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged
Gene 33 have been described previously [20]. The
mammalian expression plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged
ubiquitin was a generous gift from Dr. Wei Dai at New
York University School of Medicine.

Cells were treated and harvest for total RNAs
with Trizol reagent (Life technologies). Total RNAs
were converted to cDNA using a RT-PCR kit (Clontech)
and subjected to real-time PCR using SYBR Green
master mix (Clontech) and a real-time PCR machine
(StratageneMx3005P). The primers used are follows:
Gene
33:
5’-CTGGAGCAGTCGCAGTGAG-3’/
5’-GCCATTCATCGGAGCAGATTTG-3’,
GAPDH
(as
internal
control):
5’-ACAACTTTGGTATCGTGGAAGG-3’/
5’-GCCATCACGCCACAGTTTC-3’ real-time PCRs for
microRNAs were carried out using miScript Primer Assay
(Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The
results were corrected for U6.

Western bolt
Standard Western blot procedure was using
throughout the study. SDS-PAGE was carried out using
the mini gel system from Bio-Rad. Proteins in gels were
then transferred to PVDF membrane. After blocking with
TBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk, the membrane
was incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted
with TBST containing 5% BSA using dilutions suggested
by the manufacturers. After thorough wash with TBST,
the membrane was further incubated with horse radish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour
at room temperature followed by thorough washing
with TBST buffer. The signals on the membrane were
developed with an ECL system (Pierce).

RNAi and microRNA
For transient RNAi, cells were cultured to 70%
confluence and transfected with scrambled or Gene 33
siRNA oligos (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000
according to manufacturer provided protocol. Cells were
analyzed at least 48h post-transfection. For microRNA
inhibition, a negative control or a miR-200c microRNA
inhibitor (Dharmacon) was transfected (at 25 nM) using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Life technology)
and analyzed 24 hours after transfection. For stable
knockdown, shRNA constructs containing scrambled or
Gene 33 (Sigma-Aldrich) were transfected into BEAS2B cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life technology)
followed by selection with puromycin.

Immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in the RIPA buffer supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were
then centrifuged for 30 min at >10000g. The supernatants
were kept as total cell lysates. One μg of the antibody
and 40 μl of protein G Agarose resin (50/50, Upstate
Biotechnology) were then added to 1 mg of each cell
lysates and incubated at 4ºC for overnight followed by
extensively washing with the lysis buffer. Proteins bond to
the resin were then extracted with SDS sample buffer and
subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with
appropriate antibodies.

Cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay
BEAS-2B cells growing on a 6 well plate were
transfected with scrambled or Gene 33 siRNA oligos.
Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were passed to
2-well chamber slides. Twenty four hours later, cells were
treated with cytochalasin B (9µg/ml) for additional 24h
with or without co-treatment with1µM Na2CrO4. At the
end of the treatments, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde
and stained with DAPI (2.85µg/ml). Numbers of
micronuclei in 1000 binucleated cells were scored under a
fluorescence microscope and the ratio of micronuclei and
binucleated cells were presented as percentage.

Laser scanning cytometry
Cells were cultured on 2-well chamber slides.
After treatments, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde
followed by 70% ethanol, pemmeabilized with 0.1% triton
X100, blocked with 1% BSA, and immunostained with
primary antibodies to both γH2AX and phospho-p53 (S15)
followed by fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies
together with DAPI. The cells were then analyzed with
CompuCyte four laser iCys scanning cytometer.
