BACKGROUND: In patients with head and neck and esophageal tumors, nutritional status may deteriorate during concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of enteral nutrition enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on body composition and nutritional and functional status. METHODS: In a controlled,
randomized, prospective, double-blind, multicenter study, 111 patients with head and neck and esophageal cancer undergoing concurV
rent CRT received either an enteral standard nutrition (control group) or disease-specific enteral nutrition Supportan -containing
EPA1DHA (experimental group) via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. The primary endpoint was the change of body cell mass
(BCM) following CRT at weeks 7 and 14 compared with the baseline value. Secondary endpoints were additional parameters of body
composition, anthropometric parameters, and nutritional and functional status. RESULTS: The primary endpoint of the study, improvement in BCM, reached borderline statistical significance. Following CRT, patients with experimental nutrition lost only 0.82 6 0.64 kg
of BCM compared with 2.82 6 0.77 kg in the control group (P 5.055). The objectively measured nutritional parameters, such as body
weight and fat-free mass, showed a tendency toward improvement, but the differences were not significant. The subjective parameters, in particular the Kondrup score (P 5.0165) and the subjective global assessment score (P 5.0065) after follow-up improved significantly in the experimental group, compared with the control group. Both enteral regimens were safe and well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: Enteral nutrition with EPA and DHA may be advantageous in patients with head and neck or esophageal cancer by

INTRODUCTION
Inoperable tumors of the head and neck region and the esophagus are treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy
(CRT).1 Patients suffering from these tumor entities often show tumor-related weight loss and cachexia even before the
onset of treatment.2-7
Moreover, concurrent CRT further worsens the nutritional situation of these patients8; a weight loss of 5-10 kg during CRT is a common finding.9 By use of early enteral nutrition via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), the
weight loss can be reduced at least for some of the patients, preventing them from transition to cachexia.2,10-15 Nevertheless, the general condition of these patients often deteriorates during concurrent CRT, with a corresponding reduction in
nutritional and functional status and quality of life.2

Original Article

In tumor patients, it has been shown that the use of
special formulae and n-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), can
have a positive influence on a number of potential mediators of the tumor cachexia and thus possibly reverse or
stop the development of cachexia.16 This has a positive
influence on the nutritional status of the patients.
Van der Meij and colleagues17,18 examined the
influence of additional EPA nutritional therapy during
chemotherapy or CRT for non-small cell lung carcinoma
patients with respect to nutritional parameters and quality
of life. We performed a controlled, randomized, prospective, double-blind, multicenter study in which a diseasespecific enteral nutrition rich in n-3 fatty acids
(EPA1DHA) was compared with an enteral standard
nutritional therapy administered via PEG in head and
neck and esophageal cancer patients undergoing concurrent CRT.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study Design

This prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled
multicenter study was approved by the central ethics committee of the University of Rostock (II PV 05=2005) and
the institutional review boards of all participating centers.
Patients were recruited between September 2006 and
October 2009 (last patient out January 2010) from 10 radio-oncological centers in Germany (Erlangen, Rostock,
Halle, Dresden, G€
ottingen, T€
ubingen, Ulm, Frankfurt=Main, Homburg=Saar, Bremen). The study was conducted in accordance with the current version of the
Declaration of Helsinki19 and according to Good Clinical
Practice.20 Each patient provided written informed consent before participating in the study.
Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with
histologically confirmed inoperable head and neck or
esophageal cancer, intended for a concurrent CRT. Further inclusion criteria were body mass index of 16-30
kg=m2, a Kondrup-score 3 or subjective global assessment (SGA) B or C, a life expectancy >6 months, start of
nutritional therapy via PEG latest at beginning of the
CRT.
Exclusion criteria included metastatic disease, second active carcinoma, pregnancy, lactation, significant
cardiac disease with cardiac pacemaker. Further exclusion
criteria were: severe diarrhea unresponsive to codeine=loperamide, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type
I and II, allergy to contents of the investigational products, milk protein and fish oil, intake of muscle growth
3344

supporting substances (eg, anabolics) and additional fish
oil or EPA substitution within the last 4 weeks.
The experimental group received 500 mL of the disease-specific enteral formula Supportan, which is especially designed for tumor patients; contains high amounts
of fat (40% of energy [EN%]), protein (27 EN%), and n3 fatty acids from fish oil (2.0 g EPA and 0.85 g DHA);
and is low in carbohydrates (33 EN%).
The control group received 500 mL of the enteral
standard nutrition Fresubin energy fibre (protein, 15
EN%; carbohydrates, 50 EN%). Both formulae were provided by Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH and were
applied continuously via PEG over a maximum of 14
weeks. Both groups received an additional minimum of
500 mL of standard enteral nutrition (Fresubin) to meet
their energy needs of 30-33 kcal=kg. The patients were
also allowed to eat and drink during the period of PEG
nutrition as required. Neither the attending physician nor
the patients knew which diet was applied.
The standard oncologic therapy regimen included
concurrent CRT with cisplatin/carboplatin or mitomycin
C (with or without 5-FU) and radiation therapy according to the center’s current practice. In brief, radiotherapy
consisted of a median total dose of 66 Gy in single fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy daily (Table 1).
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS
Body cell mass (BCM) was measured by means of bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy21-23 using BodyScout software (Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, Bad
Homburg, Germany).
Fat-free mass, lipid mass, total body water, extracellular water, intracellular water, and lean tissue mass were
obtained using the BodyScout software option for water
volume analysis. Anthropometric parameters including
body weight, body mass index, skin fold thickness, and
mid-arm circumference were measured as described previously.24,25 Nutritional status was assessed using the
Kondrup score and the subjective global assessment
(SGA) as described previously.26,27 The Karnofsky index
was evaluated by the physician according to the Karnofsky
rating scale . The European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC ) QLQ-C30 questionnaire was used to assess health-related quality of
life28,29 and was completed by patients themselves. Hand
grip strength was obtained by using a hand grip dynamometer according to Jamar.30 The patient sits square in
a chair with feet flat on the floor, the elbows bent at the
side and not resting against the body. Three measurements were to be made with the dominant hand in a 30Cancer

hand was defined as “the hand the respondent would use
to cut with pair of scissors or cut bread with a bread
knife.” Patients were instructed to “squeeze as hard as possible for 3 to 5 seconds.” The peak value was considered
for data analysis. The time points for each measurement
are provided in Figure 1.
Randomization and Statistical Analysis

A stratified block randomization (1:1) with a block size of
4 was used. According to a randomization list provided by
an independent statistician, enteral nutrition products
were labeled (at the manufacturers). The patients were
stratified by study center and by site of cancer (head and
neck or esophagus) and were placed into the control group
or the experimental group.
The study was planned primarily as a phase 3
study with a 2-stage adaptive design according to
3346

Bauer and K€
ohne.31 In the first step, 2 3 40 patients
were randomized. Depending on the results of the
first part of the study, a second confirmatory analysis
was planned with recalculation of the required sample
size.
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the
change of BCM over time. These changes were evaluated
by means of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using the
baseline as a covariate and “center” and “additional
nutrition” as cofactors and are presented as adjusted
changes from baseline.
For the first 80 patients, P < .0102 indicated that
the study should be stopped, because it would show a superiority of the disease-specific EPA nutrition. A stop was
also planned at P  .5, because it would be assumed that
the nutritional therapy with EPA did not differ from the
standard nutrition. At P 5 .01022.5, the study was to be
continued with an adaptive design.

For the analysis of changes from baseline in the secondary endpoints, ANCOVA using baseline as a cofactor
was employed. Comparison of categorical variables such
as nutritional status (SGA) and quality of life (Karnofsky
index) was performed using a chi-square test. Comparison
of adverse event indices was performed by means of Fisher
exact test and=or chi-square test. For the evaluation of
changes in laboratory parameters and the comparison of
gastrointestinal symptoms, the Mann-Whitney U test and
Wilcoxon test were applied.
Continuous variables were evaluated using descriptive statistics, and unless indicated otherwise, results are
presented as the mean and=or median 6 SD. Standard
summary statistics and 2-tailed 95% confidence intervals
were calculated as appropriate. All statistical analyses were
performed using the statistical software package SAS version 9.1.3 or 9.2.0. The level of significance for all analyses besides that of BCM was set at a 5 0.05 (2-tailed).
Missing data not induced by missing control visits or
missing values in a series of measurements were excluded
from statistical analysis.

tical Principles for Clinical Trials) 32 by defining 2 efficacy
subsets related to the availability of data, holding on to the
intention-to-treat principle as close as possible. The group
of patients who were randomized and had a control examination during CRT was defined as the CRT set (n 5 84).
Those patients who also had an examination in the convalescence period after CRT were defined as the follow-up
set (n 5 69). Homogeneity analyses for baseline characteristics were performed for all patient data sets (Table 1).
Baseline characteristics (age, sex, body mass index,
cancer diagnosis) were well-balanced between groups.
However, significantly more patients in the experimental
group than in the control group consumed alcohol before
the beginning of the study (P 5 .045). The duration and
kind of anticancer treatment (CRT) were balanced in
both arms, as was the compliance to nutritional therapy
during the course of the study (Table 1).
In order to permit adequate analysis, the patients
were therefore examined as shown in Table 2.

The primary endpoint BCM (adjusted changes from baseline of body cell mass) did show a trend toward a smaller
decrease in the experimental arm, but the differences in
results were not statistically significant:
After adjusting for center, the baseline values for
BCM in the experimental arm were 22.32 6 5.21 kg and
24.13 6 6.03 kg in the control arm (Table 1). At the end
of CRT (CRT set), the BCM in the experimental arm
decreased by 20.92 6 0.65 kg (35 patients) in comparison with the control arm at 22.22 6 0.69 kg (29 patients,
P 5 .1835). At 6-7 weeks after the completion of CRT
(follow-up set), the loss of BCM in the experimental arm
was 20.82 6 0.64 kg (31 patients) compared with 22.82

0.328 kg. At least 138 patients per group would be needed
for the confirmatory stage 2 of the adaptive design. Since
the recruiting of the first 80 patients already took 4 years,
the feasibility of recruiting 276 additional patients in a realistic time frame was questioned and the sponsor decided
not to continue part 2 of the study.

Secondary endpoints
Body composition.For the remaining parameters of body
composition (Table 3), there was a similar general tendency for improvement of values in the experimental group
compared with the control group. The effect being most
pronounced for fat-free mass, total body water, and
extracellular water. All nutrition-related effects in favor of
the experimental group were more pronounced after convalescence (follow-up set) than directly after CRT (CRT
set), yet they remained statistically nonsignificant.
Anthropometric parameters.Similar results were obtained

for the anthropometric parameters such as body weight,
body mass index, skin fold thickness, and midarm circumference. In general there was a nonsignificant tendency for
improvement achieved by the experimental group compared with the control group (Table 3).
Nutritional status.In contrast to the anthropometric and
body composition parameters the nutritional status
showed significant changes in favor of the experimental
group (Table 3). The mean baseline Kondrup score
impaired nutritional status was 1.69 6 0.81 for the experimental- and 1.63 6 0.86 for the control group. While
the mean Kondrup score remained almost unchanged in

the control group, there was a significant improvement in
the experimental group after follow-up (P 5 .0165).
Compared with baseline, SGA data of the experimental group at the follow-up time point showed an
improvement in 10=35 (28.6%) patients and no change
in 25=35 (71.4%) patients. The corresponding values for
the control group were improvement in 1=30 (3.3%)
patients, no change in 26=30 (86.7%) patients, and a
deterioration of SGA in 3=30 patients (10%). These
results were statistically significant different using a chisquare test (P 5 .0065).
Overall, these results indicate an improvement of
the nutritional status in the experimental group compared
with the control group.
Functional Status and Quality of Life

After CRT and after follow-up, a slight decrease in handgrip strength was observed in both trial groups. After convalescence the decrease was more pronounced in the control group compared with the experimental group (22.72
6 0.99 kg vs. 21.57 6 0.96 kg) but statistically nonsignificant (Table 3).
For the Karnofsky performance index, a significant
difference between treatment groups was observed after
the CRT period (Table 3). The experimental group
showed a greater improvement than the control group
(P 5 .040, chi-square test). Yet after convalescence (follow-up set), the differences between groups did not
remain significant (P 5 .662, chi-square test).
Overall, the parameters of the EORTC QLQ-C30
showed no significant differences between the experimental group and the control group, except for a higher loss of
appetite with an experimental tube feed than with a control tube feed (P 5 .030, ANCOVA) (Table 3).

Laboratory Values

Laboratory values did not change significantly during the
study, with the exception of interleukin-6 after CRT. The
significantly attenuated increase in interleukin-6 after
CRT in the experimental group compared with the control group (5.25 6 3.57 vs. 17.15 6 4.01 pg=mL;
P 5 .031, ANCOVA) (Table 3) suggests an anti-inflammatory effect of Supportan.
Adverse Events

No deaths and no other nutrition-related serious adverse
events (AEs) occurred. AEs were reported in 52=55
patients in the experimental group and 51=56 in the con3350

trol group. The most frequently observed AEs were gastrointestinal disorders in 41=42 patients, followed by
general disorders and administration site conditions in
41=35 patients.
Overall, the incidence of AEs suspected to be related
to the supplemental nutritional therapy was lower in the
experimental group (6=55 [10.9%]) compared with the
control group (14=56 [25.0%]), just failing to reach significance (P 5 .0535, chi-square test).
The incidence of AEs suspected to be related to anticancer treatment (CRT) was not significantly different
(P 5 .093) between the experimental group (51=55) and
the control group (46=56).

DISCUSSION
This randomized controlled study examined the effect of
a disease-specific enteral diet high in fat, protein, and
EPA1DHA on nutritional status and quality of life in
patients with head and neck and esophageal tumors during multimodal therapy. Therefore, this study has a fundamentally different design to comparable studies with
eicosapentaenoic acid.33-36 These studies evaluated the
influence of n-3 fatty acids or EPA on the cachexia of tumor patients, but had several important shortcomings,
including different palliative chemotherapy regimens or
no tumor specific therapy at all, small sample sizes, lack of
randomization, or no nutrition support in the control
arm.33-36
Mazotta and Jeney35 and Ries et al36 concluded that
there is no conclusive data from randomized studies that
favors the use of n-3 fatty acids for tumor patients. In contrast, Colomer et al33 reported that the use of n-3 fatty
acids for tumors of the pancreas and the upper gastrointestinal tract led to an improvement in weight status, appetite, and quality of life when EPA was applied at a dosage
of 1.5 g=day for 8 weeks. The study groups of Murphy
et al. and van der Meij et al. examined the influence of
additional EPA nutritional therapy during chemotherapy
or CRT for non-small cell lung carcinoma patients with
respect to nutritional parameters and quality of
life.18,37,38 Both groups found that the additional EPA
nutritional therapy led to patients gaining more weight,
improved quality of life, and, in part, it even improved the
response of the patients to the oncologic treatment.
The study presented here differs from these studies.
First, at baseline of our study, no advanced signs of
cachexia as in the above-mentioned studies were observed;
nevertheless, the nutritional status of patients according to
Cancer

September 15, 2013

the Kondrup score and the SGA score was reduced compared with the general population . Moreover, patients in
the above-mentioned studies received the usual standardof-care support in the control arm, which did not necessarily include primary enteral nutritional therapy. As in
patients with tumors in the head and neck region, it is
well known that nutritional therapy intervention can
improve nutritional status, quality of life, and possibly the
therapeutic results as well, both during radiation therapy
alone or CRT,39 we considered it necessary to initiate
nutritional therapy even in the standard arm by means of
enteral nutrition. Thus, in the current study, both arms
included supplemental enteral nutritional therapy via
PEG, which was supported in the experimental arm
through the additional administration of EPA1DHA.
The current study thus permits quantification of the
effects of adding fish oil to supplemental nutritional
therapy.
The difference over time in the primary endpoint of
our study, improvement in BCM, did not reach statistical
significance. Both in follow-up and after completion of
CRT, the loss of BCM was reduced through the cancerspecific nutrition including EPA1DHA, but the P values
of .055 and .1835 did not confirm a significant difference.
Nevertheless, patients have experienced significant subjective benefits (Kondrup score, SGA score) from the
improvement in objective parameters of body composition. It also needs to be taken into consideration that this
study cohort only represents the first part of an adaptive
design based on the procedure of Bauer and K€
ohne.31 In
order to achieve a significant effect, it would have been
necessary to have a further 138 patients per group. Based
on the slow recruiting, it seemed improbable that enough
patients could have been included in the study in a reasonable time. Nevertheless, this study confirms the analyses
of Murphy and van der Meij18,37,38 that EPA-enriched
nutritional therapy distinctly reduces the loss of weight or
lean body mass and helps to maintain BCM in comparison with supportive standard treatment during tumorspecific therapy.
The secondary endpoints showed a different picture:
The objectively measured nutritional parameters, such as
body weight and fat-free mass, showed a tendency toward
improvement through the disease-specific nutrition
enriched with EPA, but the differences were not significant. In contrast, the subjective parameters, in particular
the Kondrup score (NRS 2002) and the SGA score,
improved significantly. This also applies to the Karnofsky
index after completion of CRT. For the EORTC score,
only the patients with additional EPA administration
3351

Original Article

showed an increased loss of appetite. The latter finding
was presumably related to higher fat (40 vs. 35 EN%) and
protein (27 vs. 15 EN%) content of the cancer-specific
tube feed as compared with the standard tube feed.
NRS 2002 is presently considered the best-validated
screening tool for measuring the nutritional risk in hospitals, with a high predictive validity of the Kondrup score
regarding improvements in outcome.40,41 The fact that
the subjective nutritional parameters (Kondrup score,
SGA rating) change significantly before the objective
nutritional parameters do, was quite a surprise for us, and
it once again points out the particular significance of the
Kondrup and SGA scores in assessing the nutritional status of patients. This screening system has been shown to
enable the distinction between trials with a positive effect
versus trials with no effect.26 Therefore, the results of subjective parameters in the present trial strongly indicate
that benefits with regard to improvements in nutritional
status and disease severity will be greater with the metabolically adapted cancer-specific tube feed than with a
standard enteral regimen in cancer patients undergoing
CRT.
Interestingly, the rate of AEs related to study CRT
was distinctly lower in patients treated with experimental
nutrition than in controls, as were the rate of premature
discontinuations due to AEs or adverse drug reactions and
the rate of AEs suspected to be related to CRT, suggesting
that the application of the experimental nutritional therapy may also be associated with a better tolerance of CRT.
In conclusion, enteral nutrition with a metabolically
adapted cancer-specific enteral formula high in fat, protein, and EPA1DHA may be advantageous in patients
with head and neck or esophageal cancer, improving parameters of nutritional and functional status during CRT.
These beneficial effects may be related to the provision of
EPA1DHA and to the specific nutrient profile adapted
to the tumor-induced alterations in substrate metabolism
by increasing the fat=carbohydrate ratio. Both enteral
nutrition regimens were safe and well tolerated.
