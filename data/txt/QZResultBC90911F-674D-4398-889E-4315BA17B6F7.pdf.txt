ABSTRACT:
We recently reported that low NM23-H1 expression of head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) correlated with poor patients’ prognosis. Growing evidence
has indicated that high tumor NM23-H1 expression contributes to a good response
to chemotherapy. Therefore, we investigated the role of NM23-H1 in susceptibility
of HNSCC cells to cisplatin and its clinical significance, as well as the in vitro study
for validation was performed. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed NM23-H1
expression in surgical specimens from 46 HNSCC patients with cervical metastases
receiving surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Low tumor NM23-H1 expression
correlated with locoregional recurrence of HNSCC following postoperative cisplatinbased therapy (p = 0.056) and poor patient prognosis (p = 0.001). To validate the
clinical observation and the effect of NM23-H1 on cisplatin cytotoxicity, we established
several stable clones derived from a human HNSCC cell line (SAS) by knockdown
and overexpression. Knockdown of NM23-H1 attenuated the chemosensitivity of
SAS cells to cisplatin, which was associated with reduced cisplatin-induced S-phase
accumulation and downregulation of cyclin E1 and A. Overexpression of NM23-H1
reversed these results, indicating the essential role of NM23-H1 in treatment response
to cisplatin. NM23-H1 may participate in HNSCC cell responses to cisplatin and be
considered a potential therapeutic target.

INTRODUCTION

in the last two decades [4]. One major cause of treatment
failure is early metastases and poor response of HNSCC
cells to chemoradiation. Clinical surveys showed that
more than half of HNSCC patients with resectable tumors
had lymphatic metastases at diagnosis [5, 6]. Therefore,
it is relevant to assess whether patients with metastases
respond well to cisplatin-based chemoradiation.
Biomarkers for predicting the response to anticancer
agents are imperative to initiate optimal treatments and
improve therapeutic outcomes.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
is the most common malignant pathology, with an
incidence ranging from <0.1% to >40% worldwide [1, 2].
In Taiwan, HNSCC has been the fourth or fifth leading
cause of cancer death in the men the seventh among the
entire population since 1991 [3].
Despite the use of multiple therapeutic modalities,
the overall survival of HNSCC patients has not improved

RESULTS

The nm23 gene was identified by differentiating
cDNA libraries from murine melanoma-derived cell lines
with different metastatic potentials. High expression of
NM23 was found in weakly metastatic cancer cell lines
[7]. The human nm23 (nme) family consists of at least
ten members and low NM23-H1 expression has been
shown to correlate with metastasis and chemoresistance
of some cancers [8-11]. However, clinical studies on
NM23-H1 expression in different cancers did not draw
a consistent conclusion [11-16]. This discordance
might arise from the inconsistency among tumor types,
specificity of antibodies and scoring system used for
immunohistochemical interpretation. It is worth noting
that carcinogenesis is a multifactorial process: a specific
factor might play a certain role within a defined period
of disease progression, and its effects might be different
in other periods. In our earlier observation, there was a
dynamic change that increased NM23-H1 protein in the
primary tumors followed by a decreased level in the
metastatic lymph nodes [6, 17]. Metastatic cells with low
NM23-H1 expression should arise from an NM23-H1deficient and genetically unstable subpopulation within
the primary cancer [18]. NM23-H1 expression might be
gradually reduced over the course of tumor development
[19]. For example, an initial decrease in NM23-H1
levels can promote cancer metastases and further loss
may confer chemoresistance. NM23-H1exhibits 3′-5′
exonuclease activity potentially involved in DNA repair
and its expression is low in metastatic cells, inferring that
such reduced protein level may allow these cells to escape
from apoptosis [19-22]. This survival mechanism of
metastatic cells may also contribute to chemoresistance of
recurrent tumors and poor patient prognosis [8]. Therefore,
potential therapeutic interventions might include restoring
NM23-H1 expression to surmount the resistance of cancer
cells to anticancer agents [23].
There is a paucity of studies concerning the
prognostic significance of NM23-H1 for cancer patients
with resectable metastases treated by postoperative
chemoradiation. We recently noted that low NM23-H1
expression of HNSCCs correlated with the occurrence
of lymphatic metastases and its protein level indeed was
reduced in the metastatic tumors [17]. To clarify the
involvement of NM23-H1 in response of residual minimal
disease to adjuvant therapy, we assessed the correlation
between NM23-H1 expression and clinicopathologic
parameters, specifically focusing on HNSCC patients
with resectable metastases treated by cisplatin-based
chemoradiotherapy after therapeutic surgery. To validate
the effect of NM23-H1 on cisplatin cytotoxicity in
HNSCC cells, we established stable clones derived from
a human HNSCC SAS cell line by both knockdown and
overexpression of NM23-H1.Following the analyses, we
deduced the role of NM23-H1 in chemosensitivity of
HNSCC cells to cisplatin.

Low NM23-H1 expression in HNSCC tumors
correlated with poor prognosis of patients treated
with postoperative chemoradiation
To clarify the role of NM23-H1 in the prognosis
of HNSCC patients with resectable metastases treated
by postoperative cisplatin, we examined NM23-H1
expression in the surgical tumor specimens. On
immunochemistry, NM23-H1 localized predominantly
in the cytoplasm and focally in the nucleus; however, we
focused primarily on its nuclear expression because of the
findings of recent studies [24, 25]. Our analysis included
46 HNSCC patients with cervical metastasis treated by
surgery and postoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiation.
The clinical relevance of tumor NM23-H1 expression was
assessed in comparison with clinicopathologic features,
including age, primary tumor size, nodal involvement,
distant metastasis and tumor recurrence (Table 1).
Seventy-four percent (14/19) of patients with locoregional
recurrence had NM23-H1-negative tumors compared with
41% (11/27) of patients without recurrence. Chi-square
test with Yates′ correction showed that more patients with
NM23-H1-negative tumors (14/25) had tumor recurrence
than those with NM23-H1-positive tumors (5/21), with
marginal significance (p=0.056).
To determine whether a low NM23-H1 level
affects on clinical outcome, we evaluated the prognostic
significance of tumor NM23-H1 expression in HNSCC
patients using the Kaplan−Meier method. On univariate
analyses using log-rank tests, patients with larger primary
tumors (p=0.030), locoregional recurrence (p<0.01), and
distant metastasis (p<0.01) demonstrated poorer survival.
Based on immunohistochemistry, patients with NM23H1-negative tumors displayed a less favorable outcome
than those with NM23-H1-positive tumors (p<0.01; Figure
1). On multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional
hazard model, distant metastasis (p<0.01) remained an
independent factor associated with patient prognosis.
However, tumor NM23-H1 expression was marginally
associated with patient prognosis, and did not reach
statistical difference (p=0.083; Table 2).

Decreased NM23-H1 expression level by
knockdown and increased NM23-H1 expression
level by overexpression
In the earlier study, we established several stable
clones derived from a human HNSCC SAS cell line by
knockdown and overexpression [17]. Knockdown was
achieved by transfection of a pSuper plasmid carrying
the shRNA sequence targeted to nm23-H1 and pSuper
alone as a control into the SAS cell line. After selection,

SASshRNAnm23 (carrying nm23-H1 shRNA) and SASshRNA
(carrying the pSuper plasmid) clones were obtained. In
addition, SAS clones stably expressing the ectopically
introduced HA-tagged NM23-H1 and harboring a control
plasmid were also established, designated as SASnm23 and
SAScontrol. NM23-H1 expression in these cell clones was
examined by Western blot (Figure 2). The NM23-H1
protein level of SASshRNA and SAScontrol remained similar
to that of parental SAS cells whereas that of SASshRNAnm23

was decreased by 75% compared with the mock SASshRNA.
Overexpression of the ectopically introduced HA-tagged
NM23-H1 was detected as a slightly upshifted molecular
weight signal.

Knockdown of NM23-H1 downregulated cyclins
E and A
To address the potential physiologic relevance of
NM23-H1 proteins in SAS cells, we evaluated whether
NM23-H1 could modulate the expression of cyclin D1,
E, A and B1. On western blot, knockdown of NM23-H1
downregulated cyclin E and A, whereas overexpression
of NM23-H1 upregulated them, compared with the mock
controls. In addition, knockdown of NM23-H1 slightly
increased the protein levels of cyclin D1 and B1, while
overexpression of NM23-H1 marginally increased them.
These results suggest that NM23-H1 plays a role in
modulating cyclin expression (Figure 2).

proliferative capacity (Figure 3A).
To explore the possibility of a subtle effect
on cellular proliferation following knockdown or
overexpression of NM23-H1, cell cycle analysis was
performed using flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3B,
normal cell cycle progression was observed in all SAS
clones. Among these clones, there was no significant
difference in cellular distribution of G0-G1, S and G2-M
phases (Figure 3C).

NM23-overexpressing (SASnm23) cells was significantly
lower than that of the mock control (SAScontrol) when
they were treated with cisplatin at 10 µM (Figure 4A).
The 50% cell growth inhibition concentration (IC50) of
cisplatin was 14.50 0.37 M for SASshRNAnm23, significantly
higher than 4.07 ± 0.22 µM for SASshRNA cells (p<0.01).
In contrast, the IC50 of cisplatin for SASnm23 was 2.63 ±
0.31 µM, lower than 5.62 ± 0.29 µM for SAScontrol cells
(p<0.01).

To ascertain whether cisplatin treatment leads
to early apoptosis of SAS cells, we conducted a DNA

cisplatin at 0, 3, 10, and 30 µM for 24 and 48 hours, there
was no DNA ladder observed, in contrast to the positive
control treated with cycloheximide (data not shown). This
result indicated that classical early apoptosis might be not
the major pathway of cisplatin-induced cell death in SAS
cells.

NM23-H1 expression was upregulated following
cisplatin treatment

We treated SAS cells with various concentrations of
cisplatin (0, 3, and 10 µM) for increasing periods (24 and
48 hours) and analyzed the cell cycle by flow cytometry.
Cell cycle arrest in a given phase of the cell cycle is
defined as when cell numbers in that phase increase
above the levels of vehicle controls [26]. Based on this
limited criterion, the exposure of SAS cells to cisplatin
primarily induced S-phase arrest with a decrease in G1
proportion. Upon 48-hour cisplatin treatment at the higher
concentration of 10 μM, there was an increase in the G1phase population of SAS cells compared with that at 3 μM
(Figure 4B).

To establish the relationship between NM23-H1
expression and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, we
examined the NM23-H1 levels of SAS cells by Western
blot. Following cisplatin treatment, there was a time- and
concentration-dependent increase in NM23-H1 expression,
with the response of NM23-H1-overexpressing (SASnm23)
cells being the most pronounced (Figure 5A). The levels
of cisplatin-induced NM23-H1 accumulation in SAS
cells were further confirmed quantitatively using flow
cytometry. Following 24-hour exposure to cisplatin, the
population of NM23-H1-positive cells was significantly
larger than that of vehicle controls in the SAS clones
with the exception of SASshRNAnm23 after 3-μM cisplatin
treatment. In addition, a significant increase in the
S-phase fraction followed NM23-H1 accumulation in
SAS cells, suggestive of an association between NM23-H1
accumulation and S-phase arrest after cisplatin treatment
(Figure 5B).

Knockdown of NM23-H1 delayed cisplatininduced S-phase accumulation
Compared with vehicle controls, 24-hour exposure
to 10-μM cisplatin caused a significant increase in the
S-phase fraction (SPF) of most SAS clones except
NM23-H1-knockdown (SASshRNAnm23) cells. Knockdown
of NM23-H1 delayed cisplatin-induced S-phase arrest
until the later time point of 48 hours and allowed more
SASshRNAnm23 cells to progress to G2 phase compared
with the mock control (SASshRNA). On the other hand,
overexpression of NM23-H1 augmented the S-phase
accumulation of SASnm23 cells compared with the mock
control (SAScontrol) with cisplatin treatment at 3 μM for 24
and 48 hours, as well as at 10 μM for 24 hours (Figure

Knockdown of NM23-H1 reduced cyclin E

by western blot for the SAS clones, including parental (SAS), mock knockdown (SASshRNA), NM23-H1 knockdown (SASshRNAnm23),
mock overexpression (SAScontrol), and NM23-H1 overexpression (SASnm23) cells. Knockdown of NM23-H1 reduced cisplatin-induced
accumulation of cyclin E, as well as maintained cyclin A at a relatively low level in SASshRNAnm23 cells, compared with the SASshRNA. β-actin

with the vehicle controls (Figure 6). After cisplatin
treatment, NM23-H1-overexpressing (SASnm23) cells
exhibited a greater increase in cyclin E levels, whereas
NM23-H1-knockdown (SASshRNAnm23) cells showed a
less pronounced increase compared with their mock
controls. Upon cisplatin exposure, cyclin A expression was
concentration-dependently reduced in most SAS clones,
with the exception of SASshRNAnm23, which maintained a
relatively low expression level. Cyclin B1 was slightly
increased upon cisplatin treatment at 1 μM and decreased
at 10 μM compared with the vehicle controls. At the higher
concentration of 10 μM cisplatin, SASnm23 cells presented
a larger decrease in cyclin B1 expression than the mock
control, while SASshRNAnm23 maintained it at a relatively
high level.

correlated with favorable response to chemotherapy
[9-11]. The NM23-H1 expression of SAS cells did not
significantly affect their growth kinetics, parallel with the
conclusion that NM23-H1 silencing doesid not provide an
intrinsic proliferative advantage to cancer cells but instead
induces chemoresistance [28]. Hence we suggest that the
effect of NM23-H1 on cisplatin cytotoxicity isnot directly
related to cell proliferation, but instead presumably to the
DNA damage response in our tested cell line.
Concerning the mechanism of action of cisplatin,
no early apoptotic DNA fragmentation was detected
after treatment, indicating that classical apoptosis may be
not the major pathway responsible for cisplatin-induced
death of SAS cells. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the
possibility that NM23-H1 could have a part in the caspaseindependent apoptotic pathway in which DNA is damaged
by single-strand nicks under certain circumstances [29].
Alternatively, we noted that most SAS cells exhibited
growth arrest following cisplatin exposure, compatible
with previous evidence [30].
Since the experimental data illustrated that the
NM23-H1 level increased in S-phase and cisplatin had a
high cytotoxicity in S-G2 phase, NM23-H1 may modulate
the cell cycle in response to cisplatin-induced events [26,
31]. Without cisplatin exposure, there was no significant
difference in cell cycle distribution among the SAS
clones established by knockdown and overexpression of
NM23-H1 [10]. Therefore, we propose that the effect of
NM23-H1 on cell cycle progression could be elicited by
cisplatin and involved in susceptibility of SAS cells to its
damage. Most anticancer agents exert their cytotoxicity
through the induction of cell cycle arrest, successively
proceeding toward cell death if extensive damage occurs
beyond repair. Following exposure to cisplatin, SAS cells
primarily accumulated in S-phase, congruent with the fact
that SAS cells can perform normal p53 functions including
checkpoint activation [32]. It is well documented that
NM23-H1 positively regulates p53 activities, thus
NM23-H1 may participate in cisplatin-induced cell arrest
[33, 34]. Knockdown of NM23-H1 delayed S-phase block
until the later time point following cisplatin treatment,
simultaneously with more cells in G2-M phases. It is quite
probable that a portion of NM23-H1-knockdown cells
may recover from the damage caused by cisplatin and then
progress to G2 phase.
We discovered that the NM23-H1 level of SAS
cells was upregulated upon cisplatin treatment in a
time- and concentration-dependent manner, with the
response of NM23-H1-overexpressing cells being
the most pronounced. In response to DNA damage,
accumulation of NM23-H1 in cancer cells was reported
to occur concomitant with its nuclear translocation [22].
Ferguson et al. demonstrated that enhanced cisplatin
sensitivity correlated with increased DNA cross-links in
NM23-H1-overexpressing transfectants [9]. Moreover,
a recent article pointed out that the 3′-5′ exonuclease

DISCUSSION
In patients with cervical metastases receiving
postoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiation, low
NM23-H1 expression in HNSCC tumors correlated
with locoregional recurrence, further indicative of poor
prognosis. Following knockdown and overexpression
of NM23-H1 in the human HNSCC SAS cell line, cells
with low NM23-H1 expression were less susceptible to
cisplatin than those with high NM23-H1 expression.
The cisplatin-induced death of SAS cells resulted from
prolonged S-phase arrest, possibly associated with
NM23-H1 accumulation in response to DNA damage. It is
likely that knockdown of NM23-H1 downregulated cyclin
E and A in SAS cells, subsequently leading to less S-phase
arrest and cell death following cisplatin treatment.
Analysis of clinical information showed that
low tumor NM23-H1 expression was a poor survival
indicator and correlated with locoregional recurrence of
HNSCC in patients with metastases treated with cisplatin
postoperatively. This finding is concordant with an
earlier report on patients with esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma undergoing cisplatin-based chemotherapy
following resection [27]. To our knowledge, there are few
articles reported about the role of NM23-H1 in response
to postoperative chemoradiation in HNSCC patients with
metastases [17]. We observed a correlation between low
NM23-H1 expression and locoregional recurrence of
HNSCC tumors, conceivably as a consequence of poor
response to cisplatin-based therapy.
The present laboratory experiments showed
that suppression of NM23-H1 expression attenuated
cisplatin cytotoxicity, and elevation of NM23-H1
expressionenhanced the chemosensitivity of SAS cells.
Both the clinical observation and in vitro study results
supported our hypothesis that NM23-H1 could be one
of factors involved in the susceptibility of HNSCC cells
to cisplatin. Our findings correspond closely to previous
researches on melanoma, esophageal, and triple-negative
breast cancers, showing that high NM23-H1 expression

activity of NM23-H1 could be involved in chromosomal
instability in esophageal cancers [35]. It is most likely
that intensified exonuclease activity of NM23-H1
following its overexpression may expand cisplatininduced DNA damage and subsequently trigger more cell
death [20, 36]. On cytometric analysis, we noticed that
a significant increase in the S-phase fraction followed
cisplatin-induced NM23-H1 accumulation in SAS cells,
implying that accumulated NM23-H1 proteins may take
part in activation of the S-phase checkpoint. Thus, we
presume that upregulation of NM23-H1 in response to
DNA damage may concurrently alter cyclin expression
and result in cell cycle arrest, thereby actng as a tumor
suppressor gene [37].
Certain reports have validated NM23-H1 modulation
of gene expression in cell cycle regulation [38, 39].
Pharmacologic studies demonstrated that overexpression
of cyclin E rendered cancer cells more susceptible to
S-phase-targeted therapies in a panel of various cancer
cell lines [40, 41]. In SAS cells, overexpression of
NM23-H1 upregulated cyclin E and further augmented
cisplatin-induced cyclin E accumulation, plausibly
contributing to increased chemosensitivity. High cyclin E
expression may assist the surviving cells in S-phase reentry from chemotherapy-induced quiescence and then
boost cisplatin cytotoxicity in S-phase [42]. On the other
hand, knockdown of NM23-H1 downregulated cyclin
E and rendered SAS cells less susceptible to cisplatin.
Nonetheless, thorough investigation of the interplay
between NM23-H1 and cyclin E is necessary to elucidate
the connection with the response of cancer cells to
cisplatin.
NM23-H1 expression has been demonstrated
throughout the cell cycle with a high level in the late
G1-early S and G2-M phases, in accordance with the
active period of cyclin A [43]. Knockdown of NM23-H1
downregulated cyclin A in SAS cells, consistent with the
observation of a low cyclin A level in the hepatoma of
transgenic NM23-M1 knockout mice. Cisplatin treatment
concentration-dependently reduced cyclin A expression in
SAS cells with the exception of NM23-H1-knockdown
cells that maintained a relatively low cyclin A level,
further inferring an association between NM23-H1 and
the cyclin A checkpoint [44]. Based on clinical data, Volm
et al. presented that reduced protein levels of both NM23
and cyclin A correlated with chemoresistance of nonsmall cell lung cancers [45]. Patients with high-cyclin A
tumors had more favorable prognosis and a better response
to chemotherapy in various cancers [46, 47]. Growing
laboratory evidence also revealed that overexpression of
cyclin A could have an additional effect on the cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis induced by anticancer agents [48,
49]. Compatible with these results, NM23-H1-knockdown
SAS cells showing a low cyclin A level exhibited less
susceptibility to cisplatin compared with mock controls.
Collectively, these findings may denote a potential
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

partnership between NM23-H1 and cyclin A with regard
to therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin.
In SAS cells, overexpression of NM23-H1 slightly
downregulated cyclin D1 and B1 whereas knockdown of
NM23-H1 upregulated them, consistent with published
reports in other types of cancer cells. Several studies
mentioned that elevated expression of cyclin D1 or B1
conferred chemoresistance, while decreased expression
enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin
[50, 51]. Similarly, there was a reduction in cisplatininduced death of NM23-H1-knockdown SAS cells that
displayed an increase in the level of cyclin D1 and B1
before treatment [52-54]. In NM23-H1-knockdown
cells, increased cyclin B1 protein may help some cells to
overcome the barriers of cisplatin-induced S-phase arrest
and keep them cycling, leading to increased cell viability.
However, beyond the scope of the present study, additional
experiments are needed to clarify the cross talk between
NM23-H1 and cyclin D1 and B1, as well as its role in the
causal link with cisplatin cytotoxicity.
In summary, our clinical data provided evidence that
relatively low tumor NM23-H1 expression was associated
with locoregional recurrence after postoperative cisplatinbased chemoradiation, further indicative of poor prognosis
of HNSCC patients with cervical metastases. Based on the
in vitro study of stable HNSCC SAS clones established
by knockdown and overexpression of NM23-H1, we
demonstrated that suppression of NM23-H1 expression
attenuated cisplatin cytotoxicity, whereas elevation
of NM23-H1 enhanced chemosensitivity. Following
cisplatin exposure, we observed the cellular accumulation
of NM23-H1 protein with a concomitant increase in the
S-phase fraction of SAS cells. In addition, knockdown
of NM23-H1 downregulated cyclin E and A whereas
overexpression of NM23H1 upregulated them in SAS
cells. These findings suggest that NM23-H1 may
participate in cellular susceptibility to cisplatin through
modulation of S-phase regulators. However, since our
results may reflect a cell line-specific phenomenon, we
will confirm their validity by testing other human HNSCC
cell lines. Future research is necessary to scrutinize the
link between NM23-H1 and cell cycle regulators in the
response of HNSCC cells to chemoradiation. As a clinical
application, increasing tumor NM23-H1 expression
may be a potential strategy to improve the efficacy of
traditional cisplatin-based therapy for HNSCC patients
with metastases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue specimens
The tissue specimens were obtained between 1984
and 1998 from 46 patients with HNSCC and resectable
7400

Oncotarget

cervical metastases treated by postoperative cisplatinbased chemoradiation. The patient ages ranged from 2470 years with a median of 45 years. All patients provided
written informed consent and this study was approved by
the Institutional Review Broad of Taipei Veterans General
Hospital. The preoperative work-up consisted of physical
examination, intraoral biopsy, computed tomography (CT)
scan of the head and neck, sonography of the abdomen,
chest radiography and whole-body radioisotopic bone
scan. We followed the same treatment plan for all patients,
who underwent surgical removal of primary cancers and
cervical metastases. Locoregional irradiation and systemic
cisplatin-based chemotherapy were postoperatively
administered. The cancer stages were categorized based
on the TNM system of the American Joint Committee on
Cancer [55]. Tumor specimens were obtained during the
therapeutic surgeries and normal counterpart specimens
were excised from the neighboring grossly disease-free
mucosa of the surgical margins. Both tumorous and
nontumorous tissues were confirmed by pathologists (Li
WY). Postoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy
was administered for all patients because of close surgical
margins, multiple metastatic lymph nodes, extracapsular
spread, or perineural invasion. Tumor recurrence was
defined as when clinical examinations showed evidence
of recurrence during the regular follow-up. The median
follow-up period was 30 months with a range of 3-218
months. Up to the time of final statistical analysis, 18 of
46 patients were alive and free of HNSCC. The overall
cumulative 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 54%,
48%, and 45%, respectively.

experiments contained both positive and negative controls
to ensure staining quality.
Slide evaluation has been described previously
[6, 17]. Briefly, the histologically non-tumorous mucosa
served as the internal negative control for each case.
Under a low-power field, ten different regions of each
slide containing tumor cells were randomly evaluated
independently by two investigators (Li WY and Wang
YF) unaware of the clinical data and at least 100 tumor
cells were examined per field. Two scoring systems, the
staining intensity and percentage of stained cells, were
included in our study. Staining intensity was scored on a
semiquantitative four-point scale as follows: 0, equivalent
to the negative control; 1, weak staining slightly darker
than the negative control; 2, moderate staining of an
intensity between scores 1 and 3; and 3, intense staining
equivalent to or darker than the positive control. We
used photomicrographs representing the four scores (03) as standards while interpreting the slides. When >5%
of cancer cells showed nuclear staining and >25% had
cytoplasmic staining intensity scores >2, the sample was
considered NM23-H1 positive. In the discrepant cases,
a final opinion was made based on consensus of the two
investigators.

HNSCC cell line and culture conditions
The human HNSCC cell line, SAS, was obtained
from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources
(JCRB, Tokyo, Japan). HNSCC cells were cultivated in
5% CO2 at 37oC in Dulbecco modified Eagles’ medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL
streptomycin). The culture media were obtained from
Gibco Laboratories (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).

Immunohistochemistry and scoring
Expression of NM23-H1 in the pathologic
sections was detected by an immunoperoxidase method
as previously described [6, 17]. Paraffin blocks were
sectioned at the thickness of 4 µm. The wax was melted
at 65°C overnight. The sections were deparaffinized in
xylene, which was subsequently removed with absolute
ethanol. The slides were incubated with specific mouse
monoclonal antibodies against NM23-H1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) followed by biotin-conjugated
goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark). Aminoethylcarbazole was used as a
chromogenic substrate and red precipitate was identified
as positive staining. The specimens were counterstained
with hematoxylin and mounted with glycerol gelatin. In
each experiment, a section of human breast cancer known
to overexpress NM23-H1 served as a positive control
(Dako) and a section with an immunoglobulin classmatched nonimmune antibody substituted for the primary
antibody by an equivalent staining protocol used as a
negative control. Each batch of immunohistochemistry

Plasmids and transfection
To generate the nm23-H1 siRNA expression
vectors, we followed the algorithm for siRNA design
based on the pSuper RNAi system protocol (Oligoengine,
Seattle, WA) [17]. Forward and reverse sequences for
anti-nm23-H1 siRNA construct were as follows: 5’ GAT
CCC CTG CAA GCT TCC GAA GAT CTT TCA AGA
GAA GAT CTT CGG AAG CTT GCA TTT TTA3’;
5’AGC TTA AAA ATG CAA GCT TCC GAA GAT
CTT CTC TTG AAA GAT CTT CGG AAG CTT GCA
GGG3’. These two 60-nucleotide-containing oligos were
chemically synthesized and annealed to form a duplex.
The annealed oligos were then ligated into the BglIIHindIII restriction sites within the pSuper vector, yielding
pSuper.nm23-H1. To establish NM23-H1 knockdown and
the corresponding mock HNSCC clones, pSuper.nm23-H1
and empty pSuper plasmids were transfected into SAS
cells using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
7401

Oncotarget

CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stable
clones were selected under Geneticin (G418, 700 g/mL;
Life Technologies) treatment for 14 days to allow colony
formation. Colonies resistant to G418 were isolated with
cloning cylinders. Individual NM23-H1 knockdown
(SASshRNAnm23) and mock (SASshRNA) clones were amplified
for further analyses.
To construct the NM23-H1 expression vector, we
subcloned the full-length cDNA of nm23-H1 tagged the
hemagglutinin (HA) into the BamH1 and EcoRI sites
of the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) plasmid. SAS cells were
transfected with pcDNA3-HA-nm23-H1 or pcDNA3
vector alone [17]. To select the stable transfectants,
these cells were treated with G418 for 14 days to allow
colony formation. Stable SAS clones overexpressing the
exogenous HA-NM23-H1 protein (overexpression clone;
SASnm23) and those containing pcDNA3 vectors alone
(mock overexpression clone; SAScontrol) were confirmed
by Western blot analysis.

Invitrogen). Suspended cells were resuspended in fresh
culture medium and stained with a 0.4% solution of trypan
blue (Gibco/Invitrogen). Cell growth was determined
with hemocytometer-based cell quantification using a
trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The doubling time was
calculated from the cell growth curve plotted over 4 days.
To assess the chemosensitivity to cisplatin, the SAS
clones were plated in 10-cm dishes at a density of 5.0 ×
105 cells/dish and incubated with various concentrations
of cisplatin (0, 1, 3, 10, and 30 µM). After a 48-hour
treatment, cells were subjected to the aforementioned
trypan blue dye exclusion assay.

Flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis and
NM23-H1 staining
Subconfluent cultures of the SAS clones were
trypsinized, collected, and washed twice with PBS. Cells
were resuspended in PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, and
stored at 4˚C. On the day of analysis, the prepared samples
were analyzed according to previously reported methods
[57, 58]. For each measurement, a minimum of 15,000
cells were analyzed. All data were analyzed using offline
software (FlowJo version 7.6.5, Tree Star Inc., Ashland,
OR).
To detect NM23-H1-positive cells, 5 × 105
cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with a
mouse anti-NM23-H1 antibody or isotype control (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 4°C for 30 minutes.
Cells were washed, resuspended, and incubated with an
anti-mouse immunoglobulin G fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated antibody (Dako) at 4°C for 20 minutes.
Cells were washed and resuspended in staining solutions
A and B for 30 minutes before flow cytometric analysis.

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Proteins were extracted from the subconfluent
cultures of SAS clones. Cultured cells were washed
twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in a
buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM disodium EDTA, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM
phenylmethyl-sulfonylfluoride, 0.01% bromophenol
blue, 10% glycerol and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate
supplemented with leupeptin (10 µg/mL), aprotinin (10
µg/mL) and protease inhibitors (10 µg/mL). The protein
content was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Western blot analysis was
performed as described previously [56]. The membrane
was probed with the specific mouse monoclonal antibodies
against NM23-H1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1: 50),
-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1: 5000), cyclin D1
(MBL International, Woburn, MA; 1: 1000), cyclin E
(MBL International; 1: 1000), cyclin A (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA; 1: 1000) or cyclin B1 (Cell
Signaling Technology; 1: 1000), and then HRP-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.,
West Grove, PA; 1:5000). Immunoreactive bands were
visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence
detection reagents (Immobilon, Millipore Co., Billerica,
MA).

Statistical analysis
To examine the relationships between NM23-H1
expression and each clinicopathologic parameter,
statistical analyses were performed with Chi-square (χ2)
tests with Yates correction or Fisher’s exact test. For
prognostic analyses, the survival curves were plotted using
the Kaplan−Meier method. The statistical difference of
survival between the patient groups was compared using
log-rank test. The joint effects of clinicopathologic factors
were further tested in the multivariate analysis using a Cox
proportional hazards model.
For in vitro studies, data are shown as the mean ±
standard error of at least three independent experiments
except where indicated. Differences between groups
at each time-point were identified by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) or Wilcoxon-signed rank test.
Statistical comparison between two independent variables
was determined by two-way ANOVA followed by
Dunnet’s test. Statistical analysis was performed using

Cell growth and viability by trypan blue exclusion
assay
SAS clone cells were plated in 10-cm dishes at a
density of 2.0 × 105 cells/dish. Once daily, cells were
washed twice with PBS and trypsinized using 1 mL
trypsin-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (0.05% trypsin,
0.53 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid•4Na (Gibco/
