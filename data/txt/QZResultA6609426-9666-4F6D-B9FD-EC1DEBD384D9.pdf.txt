BACKGROUND: The Women’s Health Initiative randomized clinical trial reported that menopausal hormone therapy
increases lung cancer mortality risk. If this is true, use of anti-estrogens should be associated with decreased lung
cancer mortality risk. The authors compared lung cancer incidence and mortality among breast cancer patients with
and without anti-estrogen therapy. METHODS: Our study included all 6655 women diagnosed with breast cancer
between 1980 and 2003 and registered at the Geneva Cancer Registry. Among these women, 46% (3066) received
anti-estrogens. All women were followed for occurrence and death from lung cancer until December 2007. The
authors compared incidence and mortality rates among patients with and without anti-estrogens with those
expected in the general population by Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) and Standardized Mortality Ratios
(SMRs). RESULTS: After a total of 57,257 person-years, 40 women developed lung cancer. SIRs for lung cancer were
not significantly decreased among breast cancer patients with and without anti-estrogens (0.63, 95% confidence
intervals [CI], 0.33-1.10; and 1.12, 95% CI, 0.74-1.62, respectively) while SMR was decreased among women with
anti-estrogens (0.13, 95% CI, 0.02-0.47, P<.001) but not for women without anti-estrogens (0.76, 95% CI, 0.43-1.23).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with expected outcomes in the general population, breast cancer patients receiving antiestrogen treatment for breast cancer had lower lung cancer mortality. This study further supports the hypothesis

KEYWORDS: lung cancer, breast cancer, mortality risk, anti-estrogens, epidemiology, population-based study.

The incidence of lung cancer has increased strongly among women in Switzerland and other industrialized countries

because of the smoking epidemic among young women.1 Despite treatment progress, survival remains poor with only
<16% of patients surviving more than 5 years after diagnosis.2 Although smoking is the main cause for lung cancer occurrence, other factors may act as modulators of the risk or the natural history of the disease. In particular, hormonal factors
that play an important role in lung development, and maturation could also be involved in lung carcinogenesis. There is
biological evidence that some lung cancer cells express active hormone receptors,3,4 and experimental studies report growing evidence that estrogens may promote lung tumor occurrence and progression.5-8 However, studies evaluating the association between menopausal hormone use containing estrogen alone, or combined estrogen and progestin and lung cancer
incidence9-20 or mortality,16,20-25 provide conflicting results. Results from randomized controlled trials showed similar
risk of lung cancer incidence13,20 but reported an increased risk of lung cancer mortality among women with versus without hormone replacement therapy (HRT).20 In particular, the Women’s Health Initiative randomized clinical trial

Lung Cancer Mortality and Anti-estrogens/Bouchardy et al

reported a 60% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59, 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.03-2.46) increased risk of dying from
nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) among women
in the hormone therapy arm versus women in the placebo
arm.20
If exposure to estrogen increases a woman’s risk of
dying as a result of lung cancer, then anti-estrogens may, on
the contrary, potentially reduce this risk. Women with breast
cancer offer a unique possibility to examine the role of antiestrogens on lung cancer incidence and mortality because
many of these women will receive anti-estrogens (tamoxifen
or aromatase inhibitors) as part of their multimodality treatment. In this population-based study, we evaluated lung cancer incidence and mortality risk among breast cancer
patients with and without anti-estrogen therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
We used information from the population-based Geneva
Cancer Registry, which records all incident cancer cases
occurring in the population of the canton of Geneva
(approximately 440,000 inhabitants) since 1970. The
Cancer Registry extracts information from various sources
and is considered accurate; it has a very low percentage
(<2%) of cases recorded from death certificates only.1 All
hospitals, pathology laboratories, and private practitioners
in the canton are requested to report every cancer case.
Trained tumor registrars systematically extract data from
medical and laboratory records. Physicians regularly
receive inquiry forms to complete missing clinical and
therapeutic data.
Recorded data include sociodemographic information, method of detection, type of confirmation, tumor
characteristics (coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, ICD-O),26 hormone
receptor status, stage of disease at diagnosis, treatment
during the first 6 months after diagnosis, survival status,
and cause of death.27
The Cancer Registry regularly assesses survival. The
index date refers to the date of confirmation of diagnosis or
the date of hospitalization when it preceded the diagnosis
and was related to the disease. In addition to passive followup (routine examination of death certificates and hospital
records), active follow-up is performed yearly using the files
of the Cantonal Population Office in charge of the registration of the resident population. Cause of death is systematically recorded and validated by consulting medical files or,
when necessary, by sending a specific questionnaire to the

Cancer

patient’s physician. Cause of death is coded according to the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems (ICD-10).27
In the current study, we included all patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1980 and
2003. We excluded breast cancer cases diagnosed at death
(n ¼ 60). The final cohort consisted of 6655 breast cancer
patients.
Because of differences in data availability, we separated the period of diagnosis 1980-1990, when information was less exhaustive, from the period 1991-2003.
Socioeconomic status was regrouped in 3 levels: low
(manual employees, skilled and unskilled workers, including farmers), middle (nonmanual employees and administrative staff), and high (professionals, executives,
administrators, entrepreneurs) based on the patient’s last
occupation or, if unemployed, that of the spouse. Familial
risk was categorized as high (at least 1 first-degree relative
with breast or ovarian cancer diagnosed before the age of
50 years), low (no affected first- or second-degree relatives
with breast or ovarian cancer), or moderate (all other
known family histories). Staging was based on the pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification or,
when absent, the clinical TMN classification.28
Method of discovery was considered as consultation
following symptoms, mammography or clinical screening, and other. Breast cancer histology was classified as
ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, other, and
unknown (no microscopic confirmation). Hormone receptor status was classified as positive (10% of tumor
cells expressing receptors) or negative (<10% tumor cells
expressing receptors). Treatment was classified as surgery
(breast-conserving surgery, mastectomy), radiotherapy
(yes, no), chemotherapy (yes, no), and anti-estrogen therapy (yes, no). During the study period anti-estrogen therapy consisted mainly of tamoxifen because aromatase
inhibitors were prescribed in Switzerland only from 2006.
As information on smoking exposure is not routinely recorded in the cancer registry database, we retrospectively extracted this data from medical files. Women
were classified as never or ever smokers and within the latter group as former smokers (defined as individuals who
stopped smoking at least 1 year before the breast cancer
diagnosis) or current smokers (defined as individuals who
smoked at the time of breast cancer diagnosis). Tobacco
consumption was expressed as number of pack-years
smoked (calculated by multiplying the number of packs
of cigarettes smoked per day by the number of years the
person has smoked).

Statistical Methods
We compared patient and tumor characteristics among
women with versus without tamoxifen by chi-square test
of heterogeneity.
Patients were followed for lung cancer incidence and
mortality from 6 months after the date of breast cancer diagnosis until December 31, 2007. Person-years at risk
were calculated to the date of end of follow-up, date of departure from the canton, date of lung cancer diagnosis, or
date of death, whichever came first.
Expected numbers of lung cancer cases and lung
cancer deaths were calculated on the basis of the cantonal
lung cancer incidence and mortality rates for each 5-year
age group and calendar year. Standardized Incidence
Ratios (SIRs) and Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs)
were then calculated by dividing the observed numbers by
the expected numbers. Statistical significance and 95%
confidence intervals were estimated assuming a Poisson
distribution.
We also modeled SIRs and SMRs by fitting Poisson
regression models using the natural logarithm as a link
and including the natural logarithm of the expected number of events as a fixed offset.29 Variables significant in
univariate analysis or most biologically relevant for developing or dying from lung cancer were entered into the

Cancer

multivariate Poisson models. In addition to anti-estrogen
treatment, we included age and period at diagnosis, estrogen receptor status, radiotherapy and chemotherapy use.
The model fitted for the SMRs did not include estrogen
receptor status, as the variable had strata with 0 events.

RESULTS
Of the 6655 breast cancer patients, 3066 (46%) received
anti-estrogen therapy and 3589 (54%) did not (Table 1).
Anti-estrogen therapy was more frequently administered
in the most recent period of the study (86% in 19912003). Compared with women without hormonal therapy, those with anti-estrogen therapy were significantly
older (mean age at diagnosis 64 and 60 years, respectively;
P < .001) and postmenopausal (79% and 68%, respectively; P < .001). As expected, tumors of women who
received anti-estrogen therapy were more likely to express
estrogen and progesterone receptors. Women with antiestrogen therapy more often underwent radiotherapy and
less often underwent surgery or chemotherapy than
women without anti-estrogens.
From medical records, we retrieved data on tobacco
use for 3322 women, ie, 50% of the study population
(Table 2). Approximately 57% of the missing data applied

to women with breast cancer diagnosed during the first
part of the study period. The proportion of never smokers
was very similar among women who received anti-estrogen therapy (63%) and those who did not (65%), and no
differences were found between the 2 groups of therapy,
neither for smoking status (former or current) nor for the
number of pack-years smoked.
The median follow-up period for the whole cohort
was 7.3 years. The cohort yielded 57,257 person-years
(21,677 among anti-estrogen users and 35,580 in nonusers). From July 1980 until December 2007, we
observed a total of 40 lung cancer cases occurring at least
6 months after breast cancer diagnosis. The incidence
rate of lung cancer was 55.4 per 100,000 person-years
for women with anti- estrogens versus 78.8 per 100,000
for women without (P ¼ .39; Table 3). Compared with
the general population, the risk (SIR) of developing
lung cancer among women who received anti-estrogens
was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.33-1.10) and among women with-

1292

out anti-estrogens 1.12 (95% CI, 0.74-1.62; Table 3).
Lung cancer mortality rates were 9.2 of 100,000 for
women with anti-estrogens and 45.0 of 100,000 for
women without anti-estrogens (P ¼ .026; Table 4).
Compared with the general population, lung cancer
mortality risk (SMR) was 0.13 (95% CI, 0.02-0.47)
among women who received anti-estrogens (P < .001)
and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.43-1.23) among women who did
not. The SIR predicted from the multivariate Poisson
regression model, adjusted for age and period at diagnosis, estrogen-receptor status, and radiotherapy use, was
1.60 (95% CI, 0.21-12.1) for women with anti-estrogen
and 2.47 (95% CI, 0.48-12.7) for women without. The
SMRs adjusted for the same variables, except estrogen
receptor status, did not change markedly from those in
the univariate analysis, indicating that these results are
likely not due to confounding variables. In particular,
the SMR for women with anti-estrogens was 0.14 (95%
CI, 0.02-1.23), and the SMR for women without anti-

no longer significant.

DISCUSSION
In analyses comparing tumor registry to population
results from standardized mortality ratios, we found that
anti-estrogen treatment for breast cancer was associated
with a reduced risk of death from lung cancer, providing
new evidence on the role of estrogen in lung cancer progression. These findings are unlikely attributable to smoking differences, as the exposure to tobacco among women
who received anti-estrogen therapy and those who did not
was almost identical. In addition, patterns of tobacco use
in our study population (never smokers 57%, former
smokers 14%, and current smokers 29%) were very comparable to that of the general female population of Switzerland in 2003 (55%, 16%, and 29%, respectively).30
However, we retrieved information on smoking history
for approximately only half of the study population. Also,
we have no information on changes in smoking habits after the breast cancer diagnosis. Missing information
mainly applied to older women diagnosed in the years
1980-1990. Because smoking was uncommon in the
Swiss female population 2 to 3 decades ago, it is likely that
most of the women with missing data on smoking were
never smokers. Indeed, when stratifying by tobacco use,
we found that women with unknown smoking status presented with lung cancer incidence rates similar to never
smokers. For women with anti-estrogens, the SIRs among
never smokers and women with unknown smoking status
were 0.35 (95% CI, 0.07-1.02) and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.041.19), respectively. For women without anti-estrogens,
the correspondent SIRs were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.11-1.61)
and 0.47 (95% CI, 0.20-0.93), respectively. These findings, plus the results of our sensitivity analysis only considering women diagnosed after 1990, confirm that
differences in smoking exposure cannot explain our
results. A limitation of our study comes from the type of
Cancer

March 15, 2011

analytical approach used to compare Cancer Registry data
with results expected in the general population, which can
also be subject to potential, random variations and confounding. Additional limitations of this study include the
few number of events, possible biases and misclassifications of data, incomplete data, and lacking type, dosage,
and duration of anti-estrogen. Strengths of the study are
its prospective design in a population-based cohort and
the accuracy of death certificates because trained tumor
registrars establish both the cause of death and the presence of the tumor at death for all diseased patients by systematically consulting clinical records and/or interpreting
questionnaires filled in by the patient’s physician.
Like other studies, we found no significant association
between lung cancer incidence and anti-estrogen therapy.31
However, we cannot exclude a protective role of anti-estrogens on lung cancer risk, as women with anti-estrogens presented a nonsignificant lower risk of developing lung
cancer, despite that another well-known lung cancer risk
factor, radiotherapy, was more often given to women with
anti-estrogen therapy than to women without (67% vs
48%). The small sample size and the short follow-up could
be partly responsible for this lack of results.
The decreased risk of death from lung cancer among
women who received anti-estrogens is compatible with the
findings of higher lung cancer mortality rates among menopausal hormone users reported by recent studies.9,20,21
The association between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and higher lung cancer mortality rates has not
always been observed. A lack of association was found in 2
studies,22,31,32 whereas a protective effect of HRT on lung
cancer mortality was reported in another 2 studies.16,23
This apparent lack of coherence may be explained by the
use of diverse study designs and important differences in
smoking levels among the examined populations. In fact,
HRT seems to act as a risk factor or prognostic factor of
lung cancer only among smokers,12,14,16,21 or more
importantly, type of HRT used. Indeed, it has recently
been determined that the effect of HRT is different

according to its formulation, with estrogen plus progesterone combination being associated with increased lung
cancer incidence9 and mortality,20 whereas no association
has been found with estrogen alone.22
From a biological perspective, the observations that
estrogen intake is associated with increased lung cancer
mortality21,24,25 and that anti-estrogen treatment is associated with a decreased lung cancer mortality, as demonstrated in this study, strongly suggest that estrogens are
involved in lung cancer progression. Previous studies have
reported that a great majority of NSCLC, which represents the majority of lung cancer cases, expressed estrogen
receptors (ER) alpha and beta.6-8,32 Experimental studies
have also shown that estrogens stimulate NSCLC cells
through ER-mediated signaling5,7,8 and that anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, inhibit tumor
growth induced by estrogen.6,33 A study examining the
level of protein expression of aromatase in 422 patients
with NSCLC reported an association between a high level
of aromatase expression and worse lung cancer prognosis.34 Finally, a recent study found several associations
between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a set of
genes involved in the pathways of sex steroid synthesis and
development of NSCLC in women.35
Our a priori hypothesis was that if estrogens have a
real detrimental effect on lung cancer outcome, then antiestrogens would affect lung cancer prognosis. Albeit comparisons across 2 separate populations should require cautious interpretation, our results show that breast cancer
patients who received anti-estrogens have a decrease in
lung cancer mortality, reinforcing the evidence that estrogen plays a key role in lung cancer progression. Existing
large randomized clinical trials for adjuvant breast cancer
therapy and for primary prevention with tamoxifen are
the ideal settings for more definitive assessment regarding
the role of anti estrogens on lung cancer outcome.
