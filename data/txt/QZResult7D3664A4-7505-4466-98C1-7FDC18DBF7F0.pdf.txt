BACKGROUND. The Renal Insufficiency and Cancer Medications (IRMA) study is a
French national observational study. The results from this study of nearly 5000
patients demonstrated the high prevalence of renal impairment in a population
of patients with solid tumors.

METHODS. Every cancer patient who presented at oncology departments that participated in the study over at least 1 of 2 predefined periods during 2004 were
included. Renal function was calculated using Cockcroft-Gault and abbreviated
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (aMDRD) formulae to estimate the prevalence of renal insufficiency (RI) according to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative-Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition and
stratification. Anticancer drugs were studied with regard to their potential renal
toxicity and dosage adjustment.

RESULTS. Of the 4684 patients from the 15 centers, 7.2% had serum creatinine

T

he increased incidence of malignancies in patients
with chronic renal failure has been discussed
since the middle 1970s.1,2 In a recent study, Cengiz
reported that 188 organ tumors (6.7%) of various
pathologies were identified in 2817 patients who had
chronic renal failure.3 Although it is known as a common pathology in the general population,4 currently,
the incidence of renal insufficiency (RI) among
patients with cancer remains unclear. Only limited
data are available. In a pilot study,5 we observed a
high prevalence of RI of approximately 33% among
316 patients from 2 anticancer centers. Only 9.2% of
those patients had elevated serum creatinine (SCR)
levels, but 33% had a creatinine clearance (CrCl) <80
mL per minute, the upper limit of normal at the time
of this study (before the Kidney Disease Outcomes
Quality Initiative [K/DOQI]-Kidney Disease Improving
Global Outcomes [KDIGO] official international definition of RI). More recently, Dogan and colleagues6
studied the frequency of abnormal renal function calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault method compared
with SCR screening in a population of 1217 patients
with cancer. RI was defined as a CrCl <90 mL per minute, as recommended by the K/DOQI. Among those
patients, 5.9% had elevated SCR levels (>1.2 mg/dL,
which corresponds to approximately 106 lmol/L), but
27.1% had RI calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault
formula.
The findings of our pilot study and of the smaller
cohort study of Dogan et al. emphasize the high incidence of RI in cancer patients. This is an important
issue in clinical practice for the handling of anticancer
drugs in those patients. Because approximately 50%
of all anticancer drugs are excreted predominantly in
the urine as unchanged drug or active metabolite(s),
any reduction in renal clearance results in accumulation of potentially toxic species and overdosage. The
dosage of chemotherapeutic agents used in these
patients with RI, thus, frequently will require dosage
reduction to avoid severe toxicities. Furthermore,
using potentially nephrotoxic anticancer drugs also
will require specific monitoring and, when available,
specific prevention methods to help reduce the risk
for renal toxicity, especially in patients who already
have abnormal renal function.

In this report, we present results from the Renal
Insufficiency and Anticancer Medications (IRMA)
study, a large, national cohort, multicentric, retrospective, observational study that was conducted to assess
the prevalence of RI in cancer patients. The objective
of this study also was to describe the profile of the
anticancer drugs prescribed to those patients regarding the need for dosage adjustment and potential for
nephrotoxicity. This study was not designed to identify the potential causes of renal function abnormalities observed in our patients. The 2 questions that we
sought to answer were: 1) Are patients with cancer frequently presenting with abnormal renal function; and
2) do the anticancer drugs prescribed need dosage
adjustment in such patients, and do they represent
further potential renal toxicity?

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The IRMA study included a total of 4684 patients
who were being treated for solid tumors (either in
hospital or as outpatients) in an oncology department. The study consisted of retrospective patient
data collection on 1 of 2, specific, 15-day periods
between either February 1 and February 15, 2004 or
October 1 and October 15, 2004. These periods were
selected to avoid summer vacations and to be representative of the whole year, with 1 period in winter/
spring and the other period in fall/winter.
Patients were included regardless of disease
pathology, treatment (antineoplastic drugs used/to
be used, pretreated or not pretreated). Patients were
excluded if they were aged <18 years, had a diagnosis of myeloma, or presented with end-stage renal
disease that required renal replacement therapy
(either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis).
Study Design and Assessments
The objectives of this national, retrospective study
were to investigate the prevalence of RI in cancer
patients in France and to characterize anticancer
drugs that were prescribed to the study population,
with particular emphasis on their potential interactions with the kidney, ie, potential renal toxicity,

and/or the need for dosage adjustment in patients
with RI.
The following data were collected for each
patient: sex, age, weight, SCR, blood urea nitrogen,
hemoglobinemia, type of tumor, metastasis, and
anticancer drugs prescribed. The upper limit of the
SCR at the Pitie-Salpetriere central laboratory was
110 lmol/L during the time this study was in progress. Patients who were known to present with acute
renal failure were excluded to determine the prevalence of potentially chronic abnormal renal function.
Estimations of renal function were made by calculating the CrCl or the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)
using the Cockcroft-Gault formula7 and the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(aMDRD) formula.8

90 mL per minute;
from 60 to 89 mL per minute;
from 30 to 59 mL per minute;
from 15 to 29 mL per minute; and
<15 mL per minute.

With regard to anticancer therapies prescribed to
study patients, those drugs that required dosage
adjustment were identified in accordance with their
pharmacokinetics and available recommendations
from both their individual Summary of Product
Characteristics (SmPC) and from 2 reference books.
In a previous study,5 the Vidal Dictionary10 and the
Physicians Desk Reference11 were used to provide information on dosing adjustments; however, it was
demonstrated that these references did not provide
the necessary information. Therefore, we used 2 spe-

cific reference books on drug dosage adjustment in
patients with RI: Drug Prescribing in Renal Failure:
Dosing Guidelines for Adults, 4th edition,12 and the
Guide to Prescription Medications for Patients with
Renal Insufficiency, third edition.13 Then, anticancer
medications were classified as ‘‘yes’’ when adjustment was required, ‘‘no’’ when adjustment was not
necessary, and ‘‘no data’’ when no data were available in the literature.
To obtain profiles of anticancer therapies with
regard to renal tolerance, an exhaustive literature
search was performed using the National Institutes
of Health PubMed14 data base to identify any potential renal side effects of the therapies. If, at least
some episodes of nephrotoxicity were identified in
the literature search, then the therapy was classified
as ‘‘yes,’’ which indicated that the drug was ‘‘potentially nephrotoxic.’’ Therapies were labeled ‘‘no’’
when no such episodes were identified or when there
were no suggestions of potential renal toxicity.
Of course, coprescriptions, such as nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, may be a concern in such
patients with potential abnormal renal function at
baseline. However, information on such coprescriptions are difficult to retrieve in a retrospective study.
Thus, we decided to focus only on anticancer drugs
and not to collect information on all of the drugs
that were prescribed to those patients.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics
In total, 4684 patients with various types of cancer
were included in the study from 15 participating centers. Of these, 64.4% of patients were women, and
the mean age of all patients was 58.1 years (range,
18–95 years). The 5 most frequently occurring types
of cancer in the study population were breast (1898
patients; 41%), colorectal (573 patients; 12.2%), lung
(445 patients; 9.5%), ovarian (270 patients; 5.8%), and
prostate (222 patients; 4.7%).
Renal Insufficiency
Table 1 lists the demographic characteristics for 4684
patients studied together with the estimates of renal
function obtained using the Cockcroft-Gault and
aMDRD formulae. Among the whole population of
patients, 339 patients (7.2%) had SCR levels >110
lmol/L. However, a large majority of patients had
decreased GFR or CrCl: 57.4% and 52.9% of patients
had abnormal CrCl (<90 mL per minute) when calculated according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula
and the aMDRD formula, respectively (Table 1). This
high prevalence of RI also was observed in 3903

patients who had normal SCR levels: 60.3% and
54.7% of patients had abnormal CrCl (<90 mL per
minute) calculated according to the CockcroftGault formula and the aMDRD formula, respectively
(Table 2).
In patients with the 5 most frequently occurring
types of cancer, elevated SCR levels ranged from
1.7% of patients with breast cancer to 14.9% of
patients with prostate cancer (Fig. 1). When renal
function was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault
and aMDRD formulae, the proportion of patients
with RI was markedly higher. For example, among
patients with breast cancer, 51.8% and 50.8% of
patients had abnormal renal function (<90 mL per

minute) according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula
and the aMDRD formula, respectively (Fig. 1).
The prevalence of RI across the different cancer
types varied from 51.8% of patients with breast cancer to 75.2% of patients with ovarian cancer when
the Cockcroft-Gault formula was used to calculate renal function (Fig. 1). When the aMDRD formula was
used, the prevalence of RI varied between cancer
types, from 50.8% of patients with breast cancer to
56.0% of patients with lung cancer (Fig. 1).
In 15.4% of elderly patients aged >75 years, SCR
was elevated. However, when renal function was estimated appropriately with the aMDRD formula,15,16
74.1% of these patients had RI according to the official

these patients, 46.9%, 22.9%, and 4.3% had stage 2, 3,
and 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease, respectively.
Anemia was observed in approximately half of
the total population: 49.2% of the 3017 women had

had serum hemoglobin levels <11 g/dL.

Anticancer Drugs
The study population of 4684 patients had 7181 prescriptions for anticancer drugs, resulting in a mean
number of 1.5 drugs per patient. In all, 18.4% of
patients were not receiving any anticancer treatment.
The prescriptions included 75 different drugs (Table 3). Of the 7181 prescriptions, 53.4% were for drugs
for which a dosage adjustment was necessary or for
which there were no available data concerning administration in patients with RI (Fig. 2A), and 53.3% of the
drugs were nephrotoxic (Fig. 3A). Of the patients who
received an anticancer drug, 79.9% received at least 1
drug that required a dosage adjustment or for which
there were no data for use in patients with RI (Fig.
2B), and 80.1% received at least 1 drug that was nephrotoxic (Fig. 3B).

quency of RI routinely is underestimated in clinical
practice, because physicians most often base their diagnosis on SCR measurements. It is crucial to emphasize that SCR is not appropriate for evaluating renal
function if it is not interpreted together with the sex,
age, and weight of the patient. These parameters
represent the muscle mass of the patient and, thus,
the creatinine production rate. Therefore, it is crucially
important to evaluate renal function with the appropriate tools in all patients, including patients with cancer, by estimating CrCl or GFR using either the
Cockcroft-Gault formula or the aMDRD formula. This
includes patients who have normal SCR levels;
because, even in those patients who had SCR levels
within the normal range, the frequency of RI, as estimated with 1 of the 2 recommended formulae, was
60.3% (Cockcroft-Gault formula) and 54.7% (aMDRD
formula) of the patients with stage 2 RI.
The use of those formulae is crucial and should
be systematic. Other methods to asses the GFR ie, renal function, also may be used. Such methods include
a 24-hour urine collection to measure CrCl or a measure of the actual GFR using a specific marker of renal
filtration, such as inulin, iothalamate, or 51 chromeethylenediaminetetraacetate (51 Cr-EDTA), for instance. However, such methods necessitate a trained
staff and time, and they are not cost effective for the
systematic evaluation of renal function. They must be
used only in some specific patients, and those who
may benefit from such a determination of renal function should be carefully identified together with
nephrologists, according to the patient’s profile and
their estimated renal function according to the Cockcroft-Gault or aMDRD formulae.
To date, we have identified no data that allow
recommending the use of 1 formula over the other,

either in oncology patients or in the general population. Most often, differences between the 2 formulae
in terms of renal function are weak. When the Cockcroft-Gault and the aMDRD estimates differ, it may
be useful to consider a measure of the actual GFR
after discussions with a nephrologist.
The frequency of RI in the general population
with cancer probably would be even greater than
that reported in the current study, because patients
with multiple myeloma were excluded. In the IRMA
study, investigators decided not to include patients
with hematologic malignancies, because the high frequency of abnormal renal function in those patients
already was known. Indeed, it is known that RI
occurs in approximately 50% of patients with multiple myeloma at some point during the course of
their disease.17 Because data were lacking for patients with solid tumors, the IRMA Scientific Committee decided to focus on this group of patients.
In the IRMA study, the prevalence of RI was
higher than that reported in our pilot study5 and in
the study by Dogan et al.6 The reason for this difference may be that, in our pilot study, we used a different definition of RI. For the IRMA study, we used
the official recommendations and guidelines from
the K/DOQI and the K/DIGO for the definition and
stratification of RI/kidney disease.9 Dogan et al. also
used this stratification and definition in their study.
The difference between the prevalence of RI we
observed in IRMA study and that reported by Dogan
et al. may have resulted from differences in patient
populations. In the IRMA study, we included 4684
cancer patients, compared with 1217 patients in the
study by Dogan et al. Furthermore, there was a high
proportion of patients with breast cancer in our
study, whereas Dogan et al. had a high number of
patients with gastrointestinal tumors; and the patients

studied by Dogan et al. were younger than the
patients studied in IRMA (mean age, 52 years and 58
years, respectively).
In the IRMA study, most patients had a stage 2
RI according to the K/DOQI definition. This means
that their CrCl or GFR, estimated with the CockcroftGault formula or the aMDRD formula, were within
60 and 90 mL per minute, respectively (37.6% according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula; 40.9% according to the aMDRD formula). For such a decrease in
renal function, drug dosage adjustments rarely are
necessary apart from some well-known examples in
oncology, such as carboplatin, which necessitates
adjustment of its dosage to renal function whatever
the value of CrCl (formulae published by Calvert
et al.18 and Chatelut et al.19). For most drugs, however, the pharmacokinetic changes induced by RI for
this degree of impairment are not significant to
require a modification of the dosage.
In patients with stage 2 RI, potential drug
nephrotoxicity is the main issue. Many studies have
demonstrated that pre-existing abnormal renal function is a risk factor for drug-induced nephrotoxicity.20
Consequently, in those patients who have mildly
decreased renal function, anticancer drugs and antineoplastic or supportive care should be selected cautiously to administer drugs that either are not
nephrotoxic or are less nephrotoxic.20
When renal function is <60 mL per minute, the
risk for nephrotoxicity is even higher; moreover, the
clinical consequences are more severe, because any
further deterioration of renal function may precipitate end-stage renal disease. In those patients, in
addition to nephrotoxicity, the question of drug
dosage adjustment is crucial to avoid an overdose
from the accumulation of the drug from reduced
excretion and related toxicities, such as neurologic,
hematologic, skeletal, cardiologic, and hepatologic
toxicities. Indeed, when renal function declines and
is below 60 mL per minute, pharmacokinetic changes
necessitate modification of the drug dosage to ensure
efficacy and safety.
In elderly patients, Verhave et al. have demonstrated that renal function should be estimated with
the aMDRD formula. Indeed, in elderly cancer
patients in the IRMA study, the prevalence of RI was
high. Almost 75% of patients whose age was >75
years had RI, and a large number of these patients
(27.2%) had stage 3, 4, and 5 RI.
Almost 80% of cancer patients received at least 1
drug that required dosage adjustment in patients
with RI or for which there were no data available
regarding their use in patients with RI (in either the
literature or the SmPC). In patients who are receiving

drugs that require dosage adjustment, CrCl should
be calculated (with the Cockcroft-Gault or aMDRD
formula) to prescribe drugs at their adjusted dosage
in accordance with their renal function. When information is not available on dosage adjustments in
patients with RI, the prescription of these drugs
should be approved by a pharmacologist or nephrologist together with the oncologist in charge of the
patient. When an alternative treatment exists for
which recommendations are available, preferably, it
should be used. In the IRMA study patients, 10.26%,
10.46%, and 10.30% of anticancer drug prescriptions
in patients who had a CrCl from 90 to 60 mL per minute, from 59 to 30 mL per minute, and from 29 to
15 mL per minute, respectively, were prescriptions of
drugs for which no data were available in the literature for dosage adjustment in RI. In patients who
had a CrCl <15 mL per minute, this proportion was
71.43% because of the low number of prescriptions
(7 prescriptions) (Table 4).
The use of potentially nephrotoxic therapies in
patients who are at high risk for drug renal toxicity
because of preexisting renal impairment should be
avoided if possible, and alternative treatments should
be considered. However, in the IRMA study patients
who had at least stage 2 RI, the frequency of nephro-

toxic drug prescriptions still was high. In patients
who had a CrCl from 90 to 60 mL per minute, from
59 to 30 mL per minute, and from 29 to 15 mL
per minute, 53.6%, 60.2%, and 67% of anticancer drug
prescriptions, respectively, were potentially nephrotoxic compounds. In patients who had a CrCl
<15 mL per minute, the low number of prescriptions meant that the data are difficult to interpret
(Table 4).
In cancer therapy, the choice of the anticancer
drug in each patient obeys multiple rules and criteria, for example, indications and protocols. It may
not be always possible to avoid using potentially nephrotoxic drugs. However, it remains very important
to be aware of the renal function of patients who
receive potentially nephrotoxic drugs. If a nephrotoxic prescription is mandatory, and there is no
other, better tolerated alternative, means of prevention of renal toxicity should be used together with
the elimination of potential risk factors for renal toxicity (Table 5). Preventative methods include appropriate hydration and monitoring of both diuresis
and renal function (CrCl) together with appropriate
dosage adjustment in patients who are receiving cisplatin. Furthermore, in those patients who require
nephrotoxic antineoplastic chemotherapy, cautious
selection and analysis of associated drugs should be
performed. For example, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, when possible, should be avoided
because they may potentiate the renal toxicity of the
chemotherapy. Similarly, vomiting should be monitored strictly, treated, and most often prevented to
avoid dehydration.
Regarding the treatment of bone metastases,
when a bisphosphonate is to be prescribed, the same
selection rules should be applied according to renal
tolerance and dosage adjustment. Similarly, it has
been demonstrated that anemia is a risk factor for
contrast-induced nephropathy.21 Because contrast
media and platins, for instance, share similar mechanisms for renal toxicity, patients with anemia also may

1383

be at risk for chemotherapy-induced renal toxicity. In
our study, almost 50% of patients had a low hemoglobin level and, thus, may have been at risk for
drug-induced renal toxicity.
In conclusion, from 50% to 60% of the 4684 cancer patients in the IRMA study had abnormal renal
function, whereas SCR levels were normal in most
patients. Therefore, in clinical practice, patients with
cancer should have their renal function evaluated
systematically with the appropriate methods. Renal
function should be evaluated by calculation with
either the Cockcroft-Gault formula or the aMDRD
formula. Such a high prevalence of abnormal renal
function has crucial consequences on anticancer
drugs handling.
Once RI has been diagnosed, anticancer drugs
should be selected cautiously in those patients who
are at risk for drug-induced nephrotoxicity and who
commonly necessitate adjustment of their dosage.
When possible, nonnephrotoxic drugs should be
used instead of potentially toxic drugs. Those drugs
for which the recommendations of use are known
clearly should be used as a priority compared with
those drugs for which data are lacking.
The IRMA study is the first large cohort study
that allows a clearer estimation of the frequency of
abnormal renal function in cancer patients. Furthermore, results from the study indicate that, in addition to the high frequency of RI, the anticancer drugs
that are prescribed to those patients interact with the
kidneys in terms of excretion or potential toxicity,
thus requiring dosage adjustments in patients with
RI and specific, close monitoring.
