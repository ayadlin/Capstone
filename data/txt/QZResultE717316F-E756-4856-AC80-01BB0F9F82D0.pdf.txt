Abstract
HER2 overexpression drives Akt signaling and cell survival and
HER2-enriched breast tumors have a poor outcome when Akt is
upregulated. Akt is activated by phosphorylation at T308 via PI3K
and S473 via mTORC2. The importance of PI3K-activated Akt
signaling is well documented in HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer
models, but the signiﬁcance of mTORC2-activated Akt signaling
in this setting remains uncertain. We report here that the mTORC2
obligate cofactor Rictor is enriched in HER2-ampliﬁed samples,
correlating with increased phosphorylation at S473 on Akt. In
invasive breast cancer specimens, Rictor expression was upregulated signiﬁcantly compared with nonmalignant tissues. In a
HER2/Neu mouse model of breast cancer, genetic ablation of

Rictor decreased cell survival and phosphorylation at S473 on Akt,
delaying tumor latency, penetrance, and burden. In HER2-ampliﬁed cells, exposure to an mTORC1/2 dual kinase inhibitor
decreased Akt-dependent cell survival, including in cells resistant
to lapatinib, where cytotoxicity could be restored. We replicated
these ﬁndings by silencing Rictor in breast cancer cell lines, but not
silencing the mTORC1 cofactor Raptor (RPTOR). Taken together,
our ﬁndings establish that Rictor/mTORC2 signaling drives Aktdependent tumor progression in HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers,
rationalizing clinical investigation of dual mTORC1/2 kinase
inhibitors and developing mTORC2-speciﬁc inhibitors for use
in this setting. Cancer Res; 76(16); 4752–64. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

ing of signaling pathways both upstream and downstream of Akt
is required for effective Akt inhibition in cancers.
In addition to PI3K-mediated Akt T308 phosphorylation, Akt
S473 phosphorylation activates Akt. Several serine-threonine
kinases can phosphorylate Akt S473, including inhibitor of kBkinase (IKK)-a, DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK), integrin-linked
kinase (ILK), and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2; ref. 2). Interestingly, this places the serine/threonine kinase mTOR in a position
to activate Akt (mTORC2) and to be activated by Akt (mTORC1;
ref. 3). The two structurally distinct complexes of mTOR are
deﬁned by the mTOR-associated cofactors. Raptor is a required
cofactor for mTORC1, while Rictor and Sin1 are required for
mTORC2. Functional distinctions are also activated downstream
of PI3K/Akt and regulate cell growth, protein translation, and
metabolism (4), which controls cell polarity and cytoskeletal
dynamics (5). mTORC2 lies upstream of Akt, directly phosphorylating Akt S473 (6, 7). Given that mTORC1 and mTORC2 utilize
distinct cofactors and substrates, mTORC1 and mTORC2 may
have distinct physiologic roles, and their dysregulation may
produce distinct pathologic consequences. This notion is supported by recent ﬁndings that Rictor/mTORC2, but not Raptor/
mTORC1, is required during mammary gland development for
ductal branching, mammary epithelial cell (MEC) motility, and
MEC survival (8).
Breast cancers often hijack many signaling pathways used by
normal MECs to support tumor cell growth, survival, and metastasis (9, 10). It is possible, therefore, that requirements for
mTORC2 in MECs are paralleled in breast cancers. However
relatively little is known about distinct roles of mTORC2 in breast
cancer formation, progression, and treatment, despite its known
role in activation of Akt, a key signaling node and critical effector
of RTKs, including HER2. We used genetic and pharmacologic

Akt phosphorylation drives cell survival, motility, and proliferation in several diseases, including cancers, causing increased
interest in upstream regulators of Akt. Many cancer studies focus
on PI3K-to-PDK1 signaling as the primary Akt activation pathway,
via Akt T308 phosphorylation. PI3K inhibition reduces P-Akt
T308, decreasing Akt signaling to its downstream effectors, including mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). In many cancers, PI3K/Akt/
mTORC1 inhibition decreases tumor cell growth and survival.
However, mTORC1 inhibition releases endogenous restraints
upon the PI3K pathway, causing resurgent PI3K/Akt signaling
and dampening net treatment response (1). A greater understand-

models of Rictor/mTORC2 blockade to determine whether Rictor/mTORC2 supports spontaneous tumor formation, tumor cell
survival, and therapeutic response to HER2 inhibition. Our study
uncovers a previously unreported role for Rictor/mTORC2 in
HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers.

Materials and Methods
Histologic analysis
Human tissue microarray (deidentiﬁed breast carcinoma specimens with normal tissue controls) was purchased from Cybrdi
(#CC08-10-001) and stained with antibodies against Rictor or
Raptor. Average positive staining expressed in percentage and the
intensity were calculated for each core. For mouse studies, tumors
were resected from mice and parafﬁn sections (5 mm) were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin or with the ApopTag TUNEL Analysis
Kit (Calbiochem). IHC on parafﬁn-embedded sections or on
human tissue microarrays (TMA) was performed as described
previously (11) using: Rictor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Raptor
(Abcam), Ki67 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), P-S6 (Cell Signaling
Technology); P-Akt S473 (Cell Signaling Technology); Rictor
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunodetection was performed
using the Vectastain Kit (Vector Laboratories), AF488-conjugated
anti-rabbit, or AF621-conjugated anti-mouse (Life Technologies),
according to the manufacturer's directions.
Mice
All animals were housed under pathogen-free conditions, and
experiments were performed in accordance with The Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
guidelines and with Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee approval. RictorFL/FL mice (12) were
kindly provided by Dr. Mark Magnuson (Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, TN) and were inbred to FVB for >10 generations.
MMTV-NIC mice (generated in FVB) have been previously
described (13). All analyses of RictorFL/FL X MMTV-NIC mice were
performed on age-matched siblings.
Cell culture
BT474, MDA-MB-361, and SKBR3 cells were purchased in 2012
from ATCC (cell identity veriﬁed by AACR using genotyping with
a Multiplex STR assay) and cultured at low passage in DMEM with
10% FCS. MCF10A and MCF10A-RictorZFN cells (Sigma-Aldrich)
were cultured in DMEM:F12 plus insulin (4 mg/mL), cholera toxin
(1 mg/mL), EGF (100 ng/mL), hydrocortisone (2 mg/mL), and 5%
horse serum and transduced with lentiviral HER2-IRES-RFP (GenTarget) and selected with 10 mg/mL blasticidin. AZD5363 and
lapatinib were purchased from SelleckChem. Lapatinib-resistant
cell lines were previously described (14).
Generation of stable knockdown cell lines
Lentiviral shRNA-encoding plasmids (Rictor shRNA #1853,
1854; Raptor shRNA #1857, 1858; scramble shRNA #1864,
Addgene) were transfected into 293FT cells plus packaging vectors. Cultured media containing viral load were used to infect
cells. Cells were selected and maintained at low passage with
puromycin (2 mg/mL).
Western blotting
Cells were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris pH 7.4, 100 mmol/L NaF, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP-40,

www.aacrjournals.org

100 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] and
cleared by centrifugation (4 C, 13,000  g, 10 minutes). Protein
concentration was determined using BCA Assay (Pierce). Proteins
separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked and probed with antibodies as
described previously (10) using primary antibodies a-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), and Rictor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the
following from Cell Signaling Technology: phospho-cocktail;
AKT, P-Akt S473, P-Akt T308, S6, P-S6, and Raptor.
Xenograft experiments
b-Estradiol pellets (0.17 mg; 14-day release; Innovative
Research of America) were implanted subcutaneously into 4week-old female BALB/c athymic nu/nu mice (Harlan Laboratories). Right and left inguinal mammary fat pads were injected with
106 MDA-MB-361 shScramble or shRictor cells in 100-mL Matrigel. Tumors were measured with calipers twice weekly.
Growth assays
Cells (5,000) seeded in 12-well plates were cultured up to 14
days. Growth media (with 1 mmol/L lapatinib, PP242, or equal
volumes of DMSO) was changed every 3 daya. Cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS, ﬁxed with 10% formalin, stained with crystal
violet, imaged, and quantitated using the Odyssey ﬂuorescence
scanner and Odyssey software. For three-dimensional growth
assay, 5,000 cells were suspended in 100-mL Matrigel and plated
in 96-well plates. After Matrigel solidiﬁed, 100-mL growth media
(supplemented with 1 mmol/L lapatinib, PP242, or DMSO) was
layered over cultures and changed every 3 days. Colonies were
photographed after 14 days.
Annexin V-FITC staining
Cells (5,000) were plated in 96-well plates in triplicate and
cultured overnight. Annexin V-FITC (5 mL; Invitrogen, 807876) in
95 mL complete or serum-free DMEM was added to each well. Live
cell ﬂuorescence was captured at 6 hours and quantitated using
ImageJ.
Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay
Cells (5,000) were plated in 96-well plates and cultured overnight. Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent (Promega) was added (1:1 ratio)
and incubated for 1 hour and luminescence was measured.
Statistical analysis
Experimental groups were compared with a control group
using Student unpaired, two-tailed t test. Multiple groups were
compared across a single condition using one-way ANOVA. To
compare the response of two agents combined to either single
agent alone, two-way ANOVA was used. P < 0.05 deﬁned significant differences from null hypothesis.

Results
P-Akt correlates with decreased survival in patients with HER2ampliﬁed breast cancers
Nearly 20% of all breast cancers exhibit HER2 gene ampliﬁcation, driving PI3K signaling and Akt phosphorylation. Notably,
HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers rely on PI3K/Akt signaling.
Because Akt is a critical signaling effector of HER2 in HER2ampliﬁed breast cancers, we examined AKT1/2/3 mRNA and/or
upregulation of P-Akt S473 in a panel of HER2-enriched
breast tumor specimens curated by The Cancer Genome Atlas

breast cancer patients (Fig. 1C, P ¼ 4.999e5, log-rank test). In

HER2-Mediated Tumorigenesis Requires mTORC2

in HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers is clear, less is known about how
kinases governing Akt S473 phosphorylation participate in the
genesis, maintenance, progression, and treatment of HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers. Consistent with a potential role for mTORC2 in
HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers, RICTOR mRNA levels assessed by
qRT-PCR revealed elevated RICTOR expression in 3 of 3 HER2ampliﬁed breast cancer cells assessed, as compared with what was
seen in untransformed MCF10A mammary epithelial cells
(MECs, Fig. 1D). RICTOR expression was higher in 2 of the 3
HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer cells as compared with luminal (N ¼
4) or basal-like (N ¼ 2) breast cancer cells that were tested. We
conﬁrmed these ﬁndings using Western blot analysis of whole-cell
lysates, revealing Rictor upregulation in 4 of 4 HER2-ampliﬁed
breast cancer cell lines over untransformed MCF10A (Fig. 1E).
Rictor upregulation in aggressive breast cancers
We used IHC to assess the mTORC2 obligate cofactor Rictor in
clinical breast cancer TMAs. Rictor was expressed below the level
of detection in normal breast and ductal carcinoma in situ specimens (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S2A; Supplementary Table
S1), in contrast to our previous ﬁndings that Rictor/mTORC2 (but
not Raptor/mTORC1) is required for mammary ductal branching
and MEC survival during puberty. This may indicate that Rictor
expression is higher during dynamic architectural changes in the
mammary epithelium, such as during puberty, but its expression
may be lower in mature, quiescent MECs, although this hypothesis has not been tested. Rictor was signiﬁcantly upregulated in
invasive breast carcinomas (Fig. 1G), 37% of which scored positive for Rictor staining (Supplementary Table S1). Rictor was
localized in the cytoplasm in a granular pattern, focused primarily
at perinuclear location. The coexpression of positivity for both
markers was 43% in IDC and 88% in ILC.
Strikingly, Rictor staining intensity was higher in grade II/III
breast tumors as compared with what was seen in grade I/II
tumors (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Analysis of TCGA-curated invasive breast cancers revealed that 8% of
all breast cancers assessed display RICTOR gene overexpression,
mutation, or ampliﬁcation (Supplementary Fig. S3), correlating
with decreased overall survival (Fig. 1G). These data suggest that
Rictor, a key factor for mTORC2 signaling, may play a role in
tumor progression, an idea motivating further studies into Rictor/
mTORC2 signaling in breast cancers.
RICTOR loss decreases HER2-driven premalignant changes to
the mammary epithelium
We assessed the impact of Rictor/mTORC2 in the genesis of
HER2-ampliﬁed breast tumors using a transgenic mouse model,
MMTV-Neu-IRES-Cre (NIC; ref. 15), which expresses a bicistronic
transcript comprised of oncogenic Neu (the rat HER2 homolog),
followed by internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and Cre recombinase expression cassettes. These mice develop mammary
tumors with an average latency of 6 months (13). Mice harboring
ﬂoxed Rictor alleles (RictorFL/FL) were crossed with NIC mice to
generate RictorFL/FLNIC, ensuring Cre-mediated Rictor elimination in Neu-transformed cells. Rictor mRNA levels were reduced in
RictorFL/FLNIC mammary samples versus Rictorþ/þNIC samples
(Supplementary Fig. S4). We analyzed hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained mammary glands of 12-week old virgin female
mice, a time point prior to palpable tumor formation (Fig. 2A).
Prominent epithelial structures seen in Rictorþ/þNIC samples
were diminished in RictorFL/FLNIC samples (Fig. 2B). Whole

mount hematoxylin-stained mammary glands showed diffuse
hyperplasia in Rictorþ/þNIC, but not RictorFL/FLNIC samples
(Fig. 2A). Importantly, focal neoplasias seen in whole mounted
Rictorþ/þNIC mammary glands were reduced or absent in
RictorFL/FLNIC samples (Fig. 2B).
IHC revealed abundant Rictor expression in Rictorþ/þNIC
mammary glands, which was eliminated in RictorFL/FLNIC samples, although occasional cells retained Rictor expression (Fig.
2C, yellow arrows). P-Akt S473 was decreased in RictorFL/FLNIC
mammary glands as compared with Rictorþ/þNIC. Histologic
evidence of apoptotic bodies in RictorFL/FLNIC samples (Fig. 2C,
black arrows) was investigated further by TUNEL analysis,
revealing >2-fold more apoptotic cells in RictorFL/FLNIC over
Rictorþ/þNIC (Fig. 2D and E). Ki67 staining, used as a marker of
cellular proliferation, revealed similar proportions of proliferating cells in RictorFL/FLNIC and Rictorþ/þNIC mammary glands
(Fig. 2D and E).
Conditional loss of Rictor delays HER2-driven tumor formation
Rictorþ/þNIC mice (N ¼ 11) formed tumors with 100% penetrance and an average latency of 135 days, but few RictorFL/FLNIC
animals ever formed tumors (5/14, or 35%), doing so with a
substantially delayed latency (Fig. 3A) and decreased tumor multiplicity per mouse (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Rictor promotes
HER2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis. RictorFL/FLNIC tumors
were distinct histologically from controls, harboring a lower nuclear-to cytoplasmic ratio, more serous ﬂuid, and more acellular
debris (Fig. 3C). Tumor cellularity was quantitated (excluding
large areas of acellular debris from analysis) revealing decreased
tumor cells per 600-ﬁeld in RictorFL/FLNIC samples versus Rictorexpressing controls (Fig. 3D). Tumor volume measured at 28 days
after initial tumor palpation revealed decreased tumor burden in
tumor-bearing RictorFL/FLNIC as compared with Rictorþ/þNIC mice
(Fig. 3E, tumor-free mice were excluded from analysis).
RictorFL/FLNIC tumors harvested 28 days after tumor palpation
displayed reduced Rictor and decreased P-Akt S473, as assessed by
Western blot analysis of whole tumor lysates (Fig. 3F and G).
These results were conﬁrmed by IHC for P-Akt S473 (Fig. 3H).
Ki67 staining was similar in Rictorþ/þNIC and RictorFL/FLNIC
tumors (Fig. 3H and I). These data are consistent with the
important role of Akt as an effector of HER2 signaling in breast
tumorigenesis and suggest that Rictor/mTORC2 is required for
Akt phosphorylation in HER2-ampliﬁed tumor cells.
Rictor loss decreases growth and Akt S473 phosphorylation in
established HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer cells
Although mTORC1-selective inhibitors and mTORC1/2 dual
kinase inhibitors currently exist, there are no mTORC2-selective
inhibitors, and the impact of mTORC2-speciﬁc inhibition in the
context of HER2-driven breast cancers is unclear. We addressed
this by transducing HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer cells with lentivirus encoding Rictor shRNA sequences (shRictor), or a scrambled control shRNA sequence (shScr). We conﬁrmed Rictor depletion in SKBR3 (HER2amp), MDA-MB-361 (PIK3CAE545KHER2amp),
and BT474 (PIK3CAK111NHER2amp) cells. Cells expressing shRictor
displayed robust downregulation of Rictor protein and decreased
P-Akt S473 (Fig. 4A). Rictor knockdown decreased growth of
SKBR3, MDA-MB-361, and BT474 cells grown in monolayer (Fig.
4B and Supplementary Fig. S5B), or embedded in three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S5C). To
deplete Rictor using an independent method, zinc-ﬁnger

Because mTORC2 activates Akt, which in turn activates
mTORC1, it is possible that the effects of Rictor/mTORC2 targeting seen here are due to inhibition of Akt-mediated mTORC1
signaling. Therefore, it was important to distinguish the relative
impacts of mTORC1 inhibition versus mTORC2 inhibition in this
scenario. Thus, we assessed HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer cells

affected by inhibition of mTORC2. While Raptor ablation
decreased growth of SKBR3 cells in monolayer, Raptor knockdown did not impact growth of MDA-MB-361 or BT474 cells in
monolayer (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S5B). In 3D Matrigel
cultures, shRaptor decreased colony formation in SKBR3 and
BT474 cells, but not MDA-MB-361 cells (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S5C). In all cases, genetic Rictor/mTORC2 targeting
decreased HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer cell growth to an equal
or greater extent than Raptor/mTORC1 targeting.
Xenografted MDA-MB-361 cells expressing shRictor formed
palpable tumors 7 to 14 days after injection, similar to tumor
formation in controls, suggesting that Rictor depletion did not
affect tumor take rate in this model. Tumor measurements
revealed similar tumor volumes in shScr and shRictor samples

tumors at 52 days after injection (Fig. 4D). Tumors assessed at
day 52 conﬁrmed decreased Rictor and P-Akt S473 in shRictor
tumors (Fig. 4E and F). Cell proliferation was not affected by
Rictor ablation in this xenograft model (Fig. 4F and G),
although shRictor tumors displayed fewer nuclei per 400

that tumor cell survival is affected downstream of Rictor/
mTORC2 ablation, but not Raptor/mTORC1 ablation.
To test the hypothesis that Rictor-to-Akt signaling drives survival of HER2þ breast cancer cells, we expressed active Akt
phospho-mimetic (Ad.AktDD) in SKBR3-shRictor and MDAMB-361-shRictor cells, rescuing P-Akt S473 despite sustained
Rictor depletion (Fig. 5E). Restoration of P-Akt in Rictor-depleted
cells increased cell survival (Fig. 5F and Supplementary Fig. S7A).
Conversely, the allosteric Akt kinase inhibitor AZD5363, which
decreased phosphorylation of the Akt substrate PRAS40 (Fig. 5G),
decreased survival of parental SKBR3 and MDA-MB-361 cells (Fig.
5H and Supplementary Fig. S7B), suggesting that HER2-ampliﬁed
breast cancer cells require Rictor-mediated Akt phosphorylation
for cell survival. These results conﬁrm that cell death occurs in
response to loss of Rictor/mTORC2 signaling to Akt, but independently of Akt-mediated mTORC1 activation.
Rictor ablation enhances lapatinib-mediated cell death in
HER2þ breast cancer cells
We tested the impact of Rictor/mTORC2 loss on therapeutically
induced tumor cell death, using lapatinib to block HER2 kinase
activity in SKBR3, MDA-MB-361, and BT474 cells. Within 0.5
hour, lapatinib (1 mmol/L) decreased P-HER2 and P-Akt S473, as
expected (Fig. 6A). However, P-Akt S473 reemerged after 4–8
hours of lapatinib treatment, correlating temporally with Rictor
(but not Raptor) protein upregulation, despite sustained suppression of P-HER2 and P-S6 (Fig. 6A). RICTOR mRNA levels were
increased after 4–8 hours of lapatinib treatment in each cell line
tested (Fig. 6B), as was RPTOR (Supplementary Fig. S8).
We next examined the effect of pharmacologic mTORC1/2
inhibition on tumor cell response to lapatinib. As expected,
lapatinib treatment blocked P-HER2 in SKBR3, MDA-MB-361,
and BT474 cells, and decreased P-S6 and P-Akt S473 (Fig. 6C).
Dual mTORC1/2 inhibition using PP242 inhibited P-S6 and
reduced P-Akt S473. However, combined treatment with lapatinib and PP242 completely abolished P-Akt S473 and P-S6 in all
three cell lines. Although PP242 and lapatinib each decreased
growth of SKBR3, MDA-MB-361, and BT474 cells as single agents,
the combination of lapatinib with PP242 blocked cell growth to a
greater degree than either agent alone (Fig. 6D and Supplementary
Fig. S9). Furthermore, the combination of lapatinib with PP242
increased caspase activity to a greater degree than either agent
alone. (Fig. 6E).
To deﬁne the impact of mTORC2-speciﬁc ablation on lapatinib-mediated cell death, we used SKBR3 and MDA-MB-361
cells expressing shRictor. HER2 inhibition combined with
Rictor depletion decreased P-Akt S473 to a greater extent than
lapatinib alone (Fig. 6F). In contrast, shRaptor had no impact
on P-Akt S473, but effectively blocked P-S6 (Fig. 6G).
Although lapatinib as a single agent decreased growth of
SKBR3 and MDA-MB-361 acini in 3D Matrigel, the combination of lapatinib plus shRictor produced the greatest degree of
growth inhibition (Fig. 6H and Supplementary Fig. S10A). The
combination of lapatinib plus shRaptor blocked growth more
than lapatinib alone, but not to the same extent as shRictor.
Lapatinib-mediated cell death as measured by Annexin-V
staining was highest in cells expressing shRictor as compared
with shScr or shRaptor (Fig. 6I and Supplementary Fig. S10B).
These data suggest that Rictor/mTORC2 targeting in HER2ampliﬁed breast cancer cells improves tumor cell response to
lapatinib.

4760 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

Rictor/mTORC2 targeting blocks P-Akt S473 and cell survival in
models of lapatinib resistance
To assess the requirement of mTORC1/2 in lapatinib-resistant
cells, we used lapatinib-resistant SKBR3, MDA-MB-361, and
BT474 cells. These cells were rendered lapatinib-resistant by
culturing in progressively increasing concentrations of lapatinib
for >6 months, and have been previously described (14). After
withdrawing lapatinib for 48 hours, we treated SKBR3-LR, MDAMB-361-LR, and BT474-LR cells with lapatinib in the presence or
absence of PP242. While P-HER2 and P-AktS473 were unaffected
by lapatinib treatment, PP242 abolished P-Akt S473 (Fig. 7A).
PP242, but not lapatinib, decreased growth of SKBR3-LR, MDAMB-361-LR, and BT474-LR cells (Fig. 7B). Caspase-3/7 activity
was increased in cells treated with PP242, but not in cells treated
with lapatinib (Fig. 7C).
We examined mTORC2 complex assembly in BT474 and
BT474-LR cells using coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) for mTOR
with Rictor. Rictor coprecipitated with mTOR in both parental and
BT474-LR cells (Fig. 7D), conﬁrming mTORC2 complex assembly. Interestingly, Raptor coprecipitated with mTOR to a lesser
extent in BT474-LR cells as compared with what was seen in
parental BT474 cells.
As PP242 blocks both mTORC1 and mTORC2, we assessed the
impact of Rictor/mTORC2-speciﬁc targeting in LR cells by Rictor
knockdown, which was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.
7E). Lapatinib did not affect the growth of SKBR3-LR, MDA-MB361-LR, and BT474-LR cells expressing shScr, while cells expressing shRictor grew at a decreased rate (Fig. 7F and G). Furthermore, LR cells expressing shRictor exhibited increased cell death
over shScr. (Fig. 7H), suggesting that lapatinib-resistant cells are
exquisitely sensitive to Rictor/mTORC2 targeting.
Taken together, these data highlight the critical role of Rictor/
mTORC2 in activating Akt to support genesis, growth, and survival of HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers.

Discussion
Approximately 20% of breast cancers exhibit overexpression
of HER2, a marker of aggressive disease (16). The studies
presented here uncover the key roles played by mTORC2/Rictor
in models of HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer initiation, maintenance, and progression. Our results show that RICTOR ablation
in a transgenic mouse model of HER2-driven breast cancer
decreased tumor formation and tumor multiplicity, suggesting
that Rictor promotes the genesis of HER2-overexpressing
tumors. Consistent with the idea that mTORC2 is a key factor
in Akt phosphorylation, Rictor depletion decreased Akt S473
phosphorylation and tumor cell survival in this model of
spontaneous breast cancer. Furthermore, RICTOR loss
decreased Akt activation (P-S473) and cell survival in multiple
HER2-ampliﬁed human breast cancer cell lines, including lines
with activating PIK3CA mutations. Other intracellular serinethreonine kinases are capable of Akt S473 phosphorylation,
including IKK-a, DNA-PK, and ILK (2). However, our studies
suggest that HER2þ human breast cancer cells and mouse
mammary tumors speciﬁcally require Rictor/mTORC2 for Akt
S473 phosphorylation, as Rictor ablation eliminated Akt phosphorylation and decreased cell survival. Interestingly, this is
distinct from what is seen in untransformed MECs, which rely
on an Akt-independent, Rictor–PKCa–Rac1 signaling axis for
cell survival, invasion, and morphogenesis (8).

Rictor/mTORC2 blocks P-Akt and induces cell death in lapatinib-resistant HER2-ampliﬁed tumor cells. Lapatinib-resistant (LR) cells were lapatinib-starved 48 hours
prior to experimentation. A, cells were treated for 6 hours with PP242 (1 mmol/L)  lapatinib (1 mmol/L) and assessed by Western blot analysis. B, cells
were seeded and cultured in monolayer for 7 days with PP242 (1 mmol/L)  lapatinib (1 mmol/L) in 10% serum, stained with crystal violet, and scanned (Odyssey) for
quantitation of crystal violet ﬂuorescence. C, cells were treated for 6 hours with PP242 (1 mmol/L)  lapatinib (1 mmol/L) and assessed by luminescent caspase-3/7
assay. D, whole cell lysates and mTOR immunoprecipitates from BT474 and BT474-LR whole cell lysates were assessed by Western blot analysis. E, cells
stably transduced with scrambled (shScr) or two distinct Rictor shRNA sequences (shRictor seq1 and seq2) were assessed by Western blot analysis. F, cells
were seeded and cultured in monolayer for 7 days  lapatinib (1 mmol/L) in 10% serum. Cells were stained with crystal violet and scanned (Odyssey) for
ﬂuorescence quantitation. G, cells were embedded in Matrigel and cultured for 14 days  lapatinib (1 mmol/L). Colonies were imaged and enumerated. H, cells were
treated for 6 hours  lapatinib (1 mmol/L) and assessed by luminescent caspase-3/7 assay. For data shown in B, C, F, G, and H, midlines are the average  SD.
Individual points are individual replicates, each assessed in duplicate.

Several preclinical studies demonstrate that Akt/mTOR inhibition is critical for full therapeutic response to HER2 inhibition in
HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers (17, 18). However, most clinical
and preclinical studies have focused primarily on mTOR associated with mTORC1, perhaps because mTORC1 is activated down-

stream of HER2/PI3K signaling. While mTORC1 blockade produces therapeutic beneﬁt, mTORC1 inhibition also induces resurgent PI3K signaling in tumor cells, reducing net antitumor activity,
and driving therapeutic resistance. mTOR kinase inhibitors,
which target both mTORC1 and mTORC2, have generated intense

HER2-Mediated Tumorigenesis Requires mTORC2

interest, although little is known about mTORC2-speciﬁc signaling in breast cancers. Our analyses, using novel transgenic mouse
models and genetic inhibition of mTORC2 reveal a key role for
Rictor/mTORC2 in HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers, including
those with acquired resistance to lapatinib.
Our studies conﬁrm Rictor overexpression in invasive human
breast tumors as reported by Zhang and colleagues (19). RICTOR
gene ampliﬁcation and Rictor overexpression was noted in a
subset of lung cancer patients with susceptibility to mTORC1/2
dual kinase inhibitors (20). Rictor overexpression was also
reported in melanomas (21), glioblastomas (22, 23), gastric
cancers (24), and hepatocellular carcinomas (25), supporting a
potential role for mTORC2 components in aggressive tumors, and
highlighting Rictor/mTORC2 as a potential therapeutic target.
As AKT1/2/3 and RICTOR gene mutations are rare in breast
cancer (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S3), Akt and Rictor
possibly are regulated at the levels of gene ampliﬁcation, transcription, and/or catalytic activity. One recent study identiﬁed
RICTOR transcripts as a miR-218 target, suggesting cancers may
beneﬁt from miR-218 loss in part through upregulation of Rictor/
mTORC2. Another study demonstrated glucose-induced Rictor
acetylation, which sustained mTORC2 activation in the absence
of upstream signaling input, driving therapeutic resistance to
inhibitors of the PI3K pathway (PMC4522814). Another study
showed Rictor T1135 phosphorylation by the kinase S6K1, which
downregulated mTORC2 activity, suggesting that alterations in
signaling pathways upstream of S6K1 could affect mTORC2.
Because the mTORC2 substrate Akt was more frequently upregulated in HER2-positive breast cancers than in TNBC (Fig. 1), we
focused our studies on HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers. However,
Rictor expression was more frequently elevated in triple-negative
breast cancers (TNBC) than in HER2-positive breast cancers,
suggesting that Rictor/mTORC2 signaling is not exclusive to HER2
tumors, but its role in TNBCs may be independent of HER2 and
Akt.
In summary, we have deﬁned a previously unreported role for
Rictor/mTORC2 in the genesis, maintenance, and therapeutic
response of HER2-driven breast cancers. We have shown that

Rictor/mTORC2 blockade is effective at each stage in the natural
history of HER2-ampliﬁed tumors, supporting continued translational investigations of dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors to improve
the outcome for patients with HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers,
and warranting future efforts to develop mTORC2-speciﬁc
inhibitors.
