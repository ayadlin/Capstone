Abstract

Author Manuscript

Tamoxifen resistance is a major problem in the treatment of Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive
patients. We have previously reported that Hexamethylene bis-acetamide Inducible Protein 1
(HEXIM1) inhibits ERα activity by competing with ERα for binding to cyclin T1, a subunit of
Positive Transcription Elongation b (P-TEFb). This results in the inhibition of the phosphorylation
of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at serine 2 and the inhibition of transcription elongation of ERα
target genes. Since HEXIM1 can inhibit ER activity, we examined whether it plays a critical role
in the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on ER. We observed that tamoxifen induced HEXIM1
recruitment to the promoter region of ER target genes and decreased the recruitment of cyclin T1
and serine 2 phosphorylated RNAPII to the coding regions of these genes. Conversely, in cells
wherein HEXIM1 expression has been downregulated we observed attenuation of the inhibitory
effects of tamoxifen on estrogen-induced cyclin T1 recruitment to coding regions of ER target
genes. As a consequence, downregulation of HEXIM1 resulted in the attenuation of the repressive
effects of tamoxifen on estrogen-induced gene expression and proliferation. Conferring clinical
relevance to our studies is our analysis of human breast cancer tissue samples that indicated
association of lower expression of HEXIM1 with tumor recurrence in patients who received
tamoxifen. Our studies provide a better understanding of the mechanistic basis for the inhibitory
effect of tamoxifen on ER activity and may suggest new therapeutic targets for the treatment of
tamoxifen resistant breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Lifetime exposure to estrogen is a major risk factor for breast cancer since estrogen plays an
important role in the initiation of tumorigenesis (Yager JD and Davidson NE 2006).
Estrogen carries out its functions by activating nuclear receptors, Estrogen Receptor α
(ERα) and Estrogen Receptor β (ERβ) that function as ligand-dependent nuclear
transcription factors (Mangelsdorf et al 1995, Yager and Davidson 2006). When estrogen
binds to ERα, the receptor changes conformation and binds to estrogen-responsive elements
(EREs) located in the promoter region of ERα target genes (Gruber CJ et al 2002,
Mangelsdorf et al 1995). The interaction between ERα and ERE leads to the recruitment of
other transcription factors that facilitate gene transcription (Mangelsdorf et al 1995). ERα
target gene transcription mediates mammary cell proliferation, increased cell division, and
DNA synthesis that elevates the risk of replication errors and can initiate tumorigenesis
(Deroo and Korach 2006).

Author Manuscript

Our laboratory identified an ER coregulator, Estrogen Downregulated Gene 1 (EDG1) as a
protein whose expression is down-regulated by estrogens (Wittmann et al 2003). EDG1 is
also known as hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (HMBA)-inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1)
because it can be upregulated in vascular smooth muscle cells by the differentiating agent
HMBA (Kusuhara M et al 1999). HEXIM1 was shown to inhibit the positive transcription
elongation factor b (P-TEFb) by interacting with the cyclin T1 subunit (Wittmann et al 2005,
Yik et al 2003). We have reported that cyclin T1 and E2-liganded-ER interact on the
promoter region of ER target genes allowing for ERα to compete with HEXIM1 for cyclin
T1 (Ogba et al 2008, Wittmann et al 2005). E2-liganded ER then enhances P-TEFb kinase
activity and phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at serine 2, resulting in
transcriptional elongation. On the contrary, increased HEXIM1 expression results in
inhibition of cyclin T1 recruitment (Ogba et al 2008) and inhibition of E2-induced
phosphorylation of RNAP II at serine 2 (Ogba et al 2008). As a result, HEXIM1 inhibited
estrogen-induced gene expression and proliferation (Ogba et al 2008). Furthermore, levels of
HEXIM1 expression were decreased in breast tumor tissue when compared to adjacent
normal breast tissues in all tumor grades (Wittmann et al 2003).

Author Manuscript

Approximately two-thirds of breast tumors express ERα (Cleator et al 2009). ERα is a
valuable predictive factor since ERα positive breast cancer cells depend on estrogen and can
be treated with antiestrogens such as tamoxifen (Lewis and Jordan 2005). Although,
tamoxifen has different agonist or antagonist effects in different tissues, tamoxifen works as
an antagonist in breast tissues by binding to ERα and blocking the interaction between
estrogen and the ER (Musgrove and Sutherland 1994). It has been effectively used as an
adjuvant therapy for ERα positive patients to reduce mortality and prolong survival time
(Osborne 1998). However, the efficacy of tamoxifen treatment is limited by the
development of resistance, with approximately half of the patients developing tamoxifen
resistance after five years of therapy (Anderson et al 2007, Zwart et al 2009). Proposed
bases for tamoxifen resistance include loss of ER expression/function, activation of growth
factor signaling pathways that circumvent tumor reliance on ERα signaling, and alterations
in the expression of co-regulatory proteins involved in mediating ER target gene

Riggins et al 2007, Ring and Dowsett 2004, Scott et al 2007).
More than 70% of tamoxifen-resistant tumors still express functional ER (Cleator et al 2009)
and because HEXIM1 inhibits ERα transcriptional activity, we hypothesized that HEXIM1
is a critical factor in the inhibition of ER activity by tamoxifen and loss of HEXIM1 may
contribute to tamoxifen resistance. To investigate the hypothesis, we examined the
recruitment of HEXIM1, cyclin T1 and serine 2 phosphorylated RNAP II to ER target genes
in the presence of tamoxifen. Furthermore, we downregulated HEXIM1 expression to
demonstrate a functional role for HEXIM1 in the inhibition of ER activity by tamoxifen. To
confer clinical relevance to our in vitro studies, immunohistochemical studies were
conducted to examine if there was a correlation between HEXIM1 expression and disease
recurrence in patients who had been treated with tamoxifen.

RESULTS
Tamoxifen enhances the recruitment of HEXIM1 to ERα target genes

Author Manuscript

We have previously reported that endogenous HEXIM1 interacted with E2-liganded ERα in
breast cells and was recruited to the promoter regions of ERα target genes (Wittmann et al
2005). Moreover, we observed that trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT)-liganded ERα also
interacted with HEXIM1 (Wittmann et al 2005). We hypothesized that HEXIM1 DNA
binding was regulated by TOT. To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in MCF-7 cells and examined the effect of TOT on
HEXIM1 occupancy on the ER-target genes, pS2 and Cyclin D1 (CCND1). In TOT-treated
cells, we observed a significant increase in HEXIM1 occupancy at estrogen responsive
regions within the pS2 promoter when compared to vehicle or E2-treated cells (Figure 1A).
We also observed increased HEXIM1 occupancy within the CCND1 promoter in TOTtreated cells (Supplementary Figure 1A).
Tamoxifen inhibits the recruitment of cyclin T1 and phosphorylated RNAP II to ERα target
genes

Author Manuscript

Our previous studies indicated that HEXIM1 interacted with and inhibited ERα activity by
competing with ERα for binding to the cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb. In doing so, HEXIM1
inhibited phosphorylation of RNAP II carboxy terminal domain (CTD) at serine 2 and
transcriptional elongation by RNAP II (Ogba et al 2008, Wittmann et al 2005, Yik et al
2003). We determined whether TOT, by increasing HEXIM1 recruitment could also inhibit
P-TEFb recruitment and the resulting phosphorylation of RNAP II. ChIP assays were
performed to study the binding of cyclin T1 and RNAP II to the promoter and coding
regions of the pS2 gene. We examined both regions of ER target genes to investigate
whether the effects of tamoxifen on the recruitment of cyclin T1 or phosphorylated RNAP II
reflected effects on transcription initiation or elongation. We observed no significant
decrease in cyclin T1 binding to the promoter region of pS2 as a result of TOT treatment
(Figure 1B). As we previously reported, E2 induced recruitment of cyclin T1 to the coding
region of the pS2 gene (Ogba et al 2008). However, TOT treatment resulted in attenuation of

E2-induced cyclin T1 recruitment to the coding region of the pS2 and CCND1 genes (Figure
1B and Supplementary Figure 1B).
We also examined recruitment of serine 2 phosphorylated RNAP II to the coding region of
pS2 gene. Treatment with E2 alone resulted in increased serine 2 phosphorylated RNAP II
recruitment, but co-treatment with tamoxifen significantly decreased E2-induced serine 2
phosphorylated RNAP II recruitment to basal levels (p value < 0.05) (Figure 1C). E2induced recruitment of serine 2 phosphorylated RNAP II to the coding region of CCND1
was also significantly decreased in the presence of TOT (Supplementary Figure 1C).

Author Manuscript

In summary, tamoxifen increased the recruitment of HEXIM1 to the promoter region of pS2
and CCND1 and attenuated E2-induced cyclin T1 and phosphorylated RNAP II recruitment
to the coding region of both pS2 and CCND1, supporting a critical role of HEXIM1 in
tamoxifen inhibition of ERα-mediated transcription.
Our previous studies indicated that E2 increased P-TEFb kinase activity. We also observed
that HEXIM1 attenuated E2–induced P-TEFb activity (Ogba et al 2008). We hypothesized
that tamoxifen would inhibit E2–induced P-TEFb activity. To investigate this, we measured
the kinase activity of P-TEFb in endogenous immunoprecipitates of cyclin T1 from MCF-7
cells using a synthetic peptide substrate (CTD4) phosphorylation. We observed that
tamoxifen decreased E2-induced P-TEFb activity in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure 2),
supporting inhibition of the transcription elongation process by tamoxifen.
Downregulation of HEXIM1 attenuates the repressive effects of tamoxifen on ERαmediated transcriptional activity

Author Manuscript

We further tested the critical role of HEXIM1 in tamoxifen inhibition of ERα-mediated
transcription by downregulating HEXIM1 expression and examining repressive effects of
tamoxifen on ERα-transcriptional activity. We developed MCF-7 cells stably transfected
with expression vectors for control or HEXIM1 miRNA and confirmed that HEXIM1
protein expression was downregulated in HEXIM1 miRNA-transfected cells when
compared to control miRNA-transfected cells (Figure 2A). We did not observe any effects
on ERα protein levels, indicating that effects of downregulating HEXIM1 levels cannot be
attributed to changes in ERα levels (Supplementary Figure 3A)

Author Manuscript

The recruitment of HEXIM1 to the promoter regions of pS2 and CCND1 genes was
decreased in HEXIM1 miRNA-transfected cells when compared to control cells regardless
of treatment (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 3B). Recruitment of HEXIM1 in
HEXIM1 miRNA-transfected cells was influenced by hormonal treatment, compounding the
relationship between HEXIM1 expression and promoter occupancy. Downregulation of
HEXIM1 expression resulted in attenuation of the repressive effects of TOT on E2-induced
cyclin T1 recruitment to the pS2 and CCND1 coding regions (Figure 2C and Supplementary
Figure 3C). Cotreatment with TOT induced an increase (although not statistically
significant) in estrogen-induced recruitment of cyclin T1 to the pS2 coding region in
HEXIM1 miRNA-transfected cells, rather than the decrease observed in control-transfected
cells. Downregulation of HEXIM1 expression also resulted in increased basal and TOTinduced recruitment of serine 2 phosphorylated RNAP II to the pS2 coding region (Figure

2D). These data further confirm that HEXIM1 is critical for the repressive effects of
tamoxifen on E2 -mediated transcription.
Downregulation of HEXIM1 results in attenuation of the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on
estrogen-induced gene expression and cell proliferation

Author Manuscript

Cyclin D1, an estrogen target gene, is a D-type cyclin that regulates G1-S cell cycle
progression during cell proliferation. Our previous study reported that HEXIM1
downregulated cyclin D1 expression levels in breast epithelial cells in vitro and in mouse
mammary glands (Ogba et al 2008). We hypothesized that downregulation of HEXIM1
would result in attenuation of inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on E2-induced gene expression
and proliferation. To investigate this, control miRNA- and HEXIM1 miRNA-transfected
MCF-7 cells were treated with E2 or both E2 and TOT for 3 hours. In control cells, we
observed that E2 treatment increased cyclin D1 expression while TOT treatment attenuated
E2-induced cyclin D1 expression (Figure 3A). However, in HEXIM1 miRNA-transfected
cells, we did not observe a significant decrease in E2-induced cyclin D1 expression as a
result of TOT treatment (Figure 3A). pS2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in
TOT-treated HEXIM1 miRNA-transfected MCF-7 cells when compared to TOT-treated
control-transfected cells (Supplementary Figure 4A). We observed attenuation of TOT
repressive affect as a result of downregulation of HEXIM1 expression in another breast
epithelial cell line, T47D (Supplementary Figure 4B).

Author Manuscript

Because TOT had reduced capacity for inhibiting E2-ER regulated transcription as a result
of downregulation of HEXIM1 expression, we examined if downregulation of HEXIM1
expression will also attenuate the inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation by tamoxifen.
In control cells, tamoxifen significantly reduced E2-induced cell proliferation from 4-fold to
1.7-fold (Figure 3B). On the contrary, inhibitory effects of tamoxifen were significantly
attenuated in HEXIM1 miRNA-transfected cells. We also observed enhanced E2-induced
proliferation in HEXIM1 miRNA-transfected cells (Figure 3B).
HEXIM1 expression is associated with decreased probability of cancer recurrence in
breast cancer patients who received tamoxifen treatment

Author Manuscript

Our previous studies indicated reduced levels of HEXIM1 expression in breast cancer
tissues when compared to normal adjacent breast tissue (Wittmann et al 2003). We also
observed that breast tumor cells expressing HEXIM1 were more likely to express ERα than
the proliferation marker Ki67. Since HEXIM1 plays critical roles in the inhibitory effects of
tamoxifen, we examined the expression levels of HEXIM1 in a case control study of breast
cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. This case control study consisted of 58 matched pairs
of ER positive tumors specimens (116 patients), from patients matched with regard to 5
criteria; year of diagnosis, patient age at diagnosis, TNM stage (tumor size, lymph nodes,
metastasis; I, II, or III), and radiation therapy (yes or no). This group was limited to women
with at least 5 years of follow-up. Cases were defined as having recurred earlier than their
matched controls. HEXIM1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining
(Supplementary Figure 5). The proportion of cases decreased with increased HEXIM1
expression (Figure 4). The estimated odds ratio of HEXIM1 expression for the cases was
less than 1, indicating that higher HEXIM1 expression was associated with lower

probabilities of recurrence. The odds of recurrence (case versus control) decreased by an
estimated factor of 0.84 for each 10 percent increase in HEXIM1 expression (Table 1).
These data support our in vitro studies revealing an important role for HEXIM1 in the
inhibitory effects of tamoxifen and that loss of HEXIM1 may be a contributing factor to the
development of tamoxifen resistance.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

The present study provides novel evidence that HEXIM1 is critical for tamoxifen inhibition
of ERα activity. Our studies also suggest that tamoxifen-liganded ER has activities on its
own and a more proactive role beyond competitively inhibiting the interaction of ERα with
estrogens. Tamoxifen-liganded ERα induced recruitment of HEXIM1 to ER target genes,
resulting in the inhibition of recruitment of cyclin T1 and serine 2 phosphorylated RNAP II
to the coding regions of these ER target genes. We also demonstrated a functional role for
HEXIM1 in the inhibition of ER-mediated gene expression and proliferation by tamoxifen.
Most importantly, our immunohistochemical studies indicate a correlation between
HEXIM1 expression and disease recurrence in patients who have been treated with
tamoxifen.

Author Manuscript

Coactivator and corepressor proteins play critical roles in mediating transcriptional
activation by the ER, and enhancement of coactivator or inhibition of corepressor expression
may contribute to the tamoxifen resistant phenotype (Ring and Dowsett 2004, Scott et al
2007). Overexpression of the coactivators Amplified in Breast Cancer 1 (AIB1) or Nuclear
Coactivator-3 (NCoA3) in breast cancer has been correlated with tamoxifen resistance and
decreased overall survival (Lahusen et al 2009). Corepressors have been reported to interact
with tamoxifen-liganded ER (Lavinsky et al 1998, Webb et al 2003). In vitro studies have
indicated that reduced levels of corepressors N-COR and SMRT resulted in attenuation of
the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen (Lavinsky et al 1998). However modulation of the
recruitment of AIB1, NCoA3, N-COR, or SMRT to ER target genes by tamoxifen has not
been reported. Correlations between the levels of known corepressors and tamoxifen
resistance in human breast tissue samples have also not been reported. We have previously
reported that HEXIM1 interacts with tamoxifen-liganded ER (Wittmann et al 2005). We
now report on the consequences of this interaction and show that tamoxifen enhances the
recruitment of HEXIM1 to the promoters of ER target genes that, in turn, inhibits the
recruitment of cyclin T1 and phosphorylated RNAP II.

Author Manuscript

To demonstrate the functional relevance of tamoxifen-induced recruitment of HEXIM1 in
the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen, we stably downregulated HEXIM1 expression and
showed that decreased HEXIM1 recruitment to the promoter region of pS2 and CCND1
resulted in attenuation of tamoxifen inhibition of E2-induced recruitment of cyclin T1.
Moreover, downregulation of HEXIM1 resulted in the enhancement of E2-induced cell
proliferation, and attenuated the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on cyclin D1 expression and
cell proliferation. Therefore, our studies provide evidence for a critical role of HEXIM1 in
the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen.

E2 binds to ER at the hydrophobic pocket of ligand binding domain (LBD) that is sealed by
helix 12 providing a platform for recruiting coactivator proteins. Tamoxifen also binds to
ER at LBD and repositions helix 12. A key difference between E2-liganded ER and SERMor tamoxifen- ER complex is that helix 12 is prevented from sealing the ligand binding
pocket (Shiau et al 1998). HEXIM1 has been shown to interact with the E/F domain of ERα
in vitro (Wittmann et al 2005). The binding of tamoxifen to ER resulted in several residues
exposing different side chains than those observed in E2-liganded ER (Shiau et al 1998),
perhaps allowing for an interaction with HEXIM1 to be more energetically favored. Based
on our current studies, we speculate that tamoxifen can enhance HEXIM1 recruitment to ER
target genes because of conformational changes that occur after tamoxifen binds to ER that
allows for higher affinity binding to HEXIM1 than E2-liganded ER. Further studies should
be done to gain a better understanding of structural basis for the interaction of HEXIM1 with
tamoxifen-liganded ER.

Author Manuscript

The clinical relevance of our findings was supported by our immunohistochemical analysis
of HEXIM1 expression in human breast cancer specimens. Our studies indicated that lower
expression of HEXIM1 was significantly associated with increased risk of tumor recurrence
in patients who received tamoxifen treatment. Thus we speculate that loss of HEXIM1 may
be involved in the development of tamoxifen resistance. Therefore, therapies aimed at
increasing HEXIM1 expression can be developed for tamoxifen-resistant patients to
improve breast cancer survival. We are currently testing this possibility using mouse models
generated in our laboratory.

Construction of expression vectors for control or HEXIM1 miRNA were described
previously (Ogba et al 2008). A Pol II promoter-driven miRNA expression vector system
(Invitrogen, CA) was used. To make pcDNA-HEXIM1 miRNA, miRNA oligos (Ogba et al
2008) were annealed and cloned into the pcDNA 6.2 GW/EmGFP vector (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MCF-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA
6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR expression vectors containing either the HEXIM1 miRNA insert or a
control miRNA insert. Following blasticidin selection, cells expressing the highest level of
GFP were flow-sorted and expanded
Western Blot

Kinase assays were performed as previously described protocols (Ogba et al 2008).
Proliferation assay
MCF-7 cells transfected with expression vector for control miRNA or HEXIM1 miRNA
were plated onto 96 well plates. Cells were treated with 10 nM E2, 100 nM TOT, or both 10
nM E2 and 100 nM TOT for 7 days. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT based
Cell Growth Determination Kit from Sigma-Aldrich according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Human breast tissue samples were obtained from the Cooperative Breast Cancer Tissue
Resource (CBCTR). All samples were confirmed to be ER positive by IHC, and pairs were
matched by 5 criteria including: year of diagnosis by 5 year categories, patient age at
diagnosis by 5 year categories, TNM stage, and radiation therapy. Controls were defined as
having verified recurrence free survival greater than that for their matched case. Sixty-four
matched pairs were initially identified, and 6 pairs were eventually eliminated due to
technical problems with at least one of the pairs slides.

Author Manuscript

We carried out immunohistochemical staining to detect HEXIM1 levels. Breast tissue
samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 micron thickness.
Paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. To unmask epitopes we used heat –
induced antigen retrieval technique using 10 mM Citrate buffer (pH 6.0). After peroxidase
block, samples were blocked with PBS containing 10% goat serum and 10% Triton X-100.
Sections were incubated with HEXIM1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) and
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:200 dilution). Duplicate sections
were immunostained with nonspecific rabbit IgG. Staining was classified according to
intensity of HEXIM1 expression in tumor cells in 4 categories: negative (0), weak (1),
moderate (2), strong (3), and very strong (4).
Statistics
The odds ratio (for the association between HEXIM1 levels and recurrence) and
corresponding 95% confidence interval were estimated using conditional logistic regression
in the SAS Logist Procedure (SAS System Version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc.). The p-value was
obtained using an exact test of the null hypothesis that the odds ratio equals 1. Statistical
significance was accepted at p < 0.05.

Figure 4. Expression levels of HEXIM1 in breast tissue from case control study of breast cancer
patients treated with tamoxifen

Sections from tumor specimens obtained from matched “control” and “case” patients were
stained for endogenous HEXIM1 as described in the "Materials and Methods" section.
“Cases” were defined as having recurred earlier than their matched controls. Shown is the
graph of logit (log(p/(1-p)) proportion of patient (p) with breast cancer recurrence after
tamoxifen within each of five approximately equal size groups based on HEXIM1
expression.
