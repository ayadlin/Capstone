BACKGROUND. The prognosis for patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas is
poor and treatment options are limited. Current chemotherapeutic regimens can
improve clinical outcomes, but extend survival by only a few months. Temozolomide is a methylating agent that is typically administered once daily. Because
preclinical studies suggested that a twice-daily dosing schedule might be more effective, the safety and efficacy of twice-daily dosing of temozolomide were studied in
patients with recurrent gliomas at their first, second, or third recurrence.

METHODS. This multi-institutional trial enrolled 120 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), or anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO). An initial oral dose of 200 mg/m2 of temozolomide was followed

by 9 consecutive doses of 90-mg/m2 every 12 hours. Treatment cycles were
repeated every 28 days. Doses were escalated to 100 mg/m2 twice daily in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or were reduced if unacceptable toxicity occurred.

RESULTS. For GBM, AA, and AO patients, respectively, the median progressionfree survival (PFS) was 4.2 months, 5.8 months, and 7.7 months, whereas the median overall survival (OS) was 8.8 months, 14.6 months, and 18 months. The
overall response rate (partial and complete) for the GBM, AA, and AO patients
was 31%, 46%, and 46%, respectively. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia
(1.1%), thrombocytopenia (3.6%), and anemia (0.3%) (graded according to the
World Health Organization grading system).
CONCLUSIONS. Twice-daily dosing may enhance the efficacy of temozolomide in
the treatment of recurrent gliomas without increasing toxicity. This regimen compares favorably with other dosing schedules of temozolomide reported in the lit-

igh-grade gliomas are highly aggressive tumors
that are rarely cured by conventional treatments
such as surgery and radiotherapy. The prognosis for
patients with recurrent gliomas is poor because treatment options are limited and few patients survive
more than 2 years.1 In these patients repeat surgery
may not be feasible because of tumor infiltration of
critical structures. Additional radiation treatment is
of limited utility in controlling tumor growth and
may potentiate neurologic toxicity. Although chemotherapy improves outcome in the adjuvant setting, it
extends survival only by a few months.2 Moreover,
high-grade gliomas are heterogeneous in nature and
the response to chemotherapy has been shown to
differ considerably according to tumor type. The anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) subgroup of gliomas
has demonstrated chemosensitivity, but responses
are less frequent for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).2–4
Temozolomide (Temodar, Schering, Kenilworth,
NJ), a second-generation DNA methylating agent, is
rapidly absorbed orally.5 It readily penetrates the
blood-brain barrier, with a reported cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF)-plasma concentration ratio of up to 40%.6
Temozolomide has demonstrated antitumor activity in
several human brain tumor xenograft models, including carmustine-resistant tumors.7,8 In addition, clinical
studies have shown single-agent activity in patients
with recurrent/refractory anaplastic gliomas and
GBMs.9–11 In clinical trials, temozolomide was generally well tolerated, with minimal toxicity and predictable myelosuppression; grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia
was noted in only 7% of patients (graded according to
the World Health Organization grading system). The
standard dosage is 150 to 200 mg/m2 once daily for 5
consecutive days in a 28-day treatment cycle. However, both experimentally and clinically, the response
to temozolomide has been found to be dose-dependent and schedule-dependent; more dose-intense regimens may be more effective than single-dose therapy
or the standard 5-day dosing regimen.5,12–14
Temozolomide undergoes nonenzymatic chemical conversion to its active metabolite, monomethyl
triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC).5 The cytotoxic effects of temozolomide are by methylation of
O6 guanine residues in DNA, which forms the cytotoxic adduct O6-methylguanine (O6-mG).12 Repair of
this adduct is by O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGAT) and mediates resistance to temozolomide
and other alkylating drugs.15 During DNA adduct
repair, AGAT is irreversibly inactivated and new synthesis is required to restore repair activity. It has
been hypothesized that increasing the frequency of
administration of temozolomide might deplete more

AGAT.16 Gerson et al.17 initially reported that in cancer patients a temozolomide dosing schedule with a
bolus dose of 200 mg/m2 followed by 9 doses (50–
100 mg/m2) given twice daily for 5 days resulted in
rapid depletion of AGAT activity (>90%) in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This multicenter, single-arm phase 2 study was
designed to determine the efficacy and safety of a
twice-daily temozolomide regimen in patients with
recurrent high-grade gliomas. As in many previous
studies in glioma the primary objective was to determine progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary
objectives were to assess tumor response rates and
toxicity. All patients underwent a baseline neurologic
and general medical examination before starting
chemotherapy. Complete blood counts were performed weekly and liver function tests and electrolyte measurements were performed monthly.
Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) was performed every 2 treatment cycles within
7 days of the next cycle.
In the study protocol, the required number of
events (ie, progression or death) was determined
such that there was approximately 80% power to
detect a 50% improvement in median PFS compared
with historical controls (3 months for GBM and 6
months for AA and AO)12,18–21 using a 1-sided Wald
test under exponential survival. This required enrollment of approximately 30 patients with GBM, 30
patients with AA, and 40 patients with AO to achieve
a power of 86%, 83%, and 92%, respectively. The
study enrolled 68 patients with GBM, 28 with AA,
and 24 with AO. With this sample size at the
observed median survival, the empiric powers were
71%, 32%, and 28%, respectively.
Patient Eligibility
This protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of each participating institution
and was conducted in accordance with the principles
of the Helsinki Declaration and HIPAA guidelines. All
patients provided written informed consent. Eligible
patients were those with recurrent/progressive (up to
and including 3 recurrences) malignant gliomas
(GBM, AA, or AO) who had MRI-measurable disease
within 3 weeks of the initiation of treatment. Patients
upgraded from low-grade glioma were not eligible.
Last prior radiation and chemotherapy had to be 12
and 6 weeks, respectively, before study entry. Patients
were excluded if they had received prior treatment

Twice-Daily Temozolomide for Recurrent Glioma/Balmaceda et al.

with temozolomide for glioma. Other entry criteria
included a Karnofsky performance status >60, life expectancy 12 weeks, age 18 years, and absence of
pregnancy or lactation. Required baseline laboratory
measurements were as follows: an absolute neutrophil
count >1500/mm3, a platelet count >100,000/mm3, hemoglobin >10 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
<1.53 the upper limit of normal (ULN), and aspartate
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels
<33 ULN. Patients were excluded if they had not recovered from the toxicities of previous treatments or had
tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus.

Treatment
Temozolomide was administered orally in a fasting
state on a twice-daily schedule for 5 days. An oral
dose of 200 mg/m2 on the morning of the first day
was followed 12 hours later by 9 doses of 90 mg/m2
every 12 hours. Treatment cycles were repeated every
28 days. Responses to chemotherapy were evaluated
every 2 cycles by MRI and were tabulated according
to the criteria of Macdonald et al.22 Patients without
disease progression while receiving temozolomide
therapy received a maximum of 12 treatment cycles.
In some instances, IRB approval was requested to allow
for treatment beyond 12 months, up to 20 months. In
the absence of unacceptable toxicity after the first
cycle, dosing for subsequent cycles was escalated to
100 mg/m2 twice daily after the initial dose of 200 mg/
m2. For patients with hematologic or any other therapy-related toxicity, prespecified dose reductions were
made, as shown in Table 1. Patients who required a
dose reduction in the previous cycle were required to
recover to nadir toxicity level 0 with a hematocrit 30
before the next treatment cycle to continue therapy.
Patient evaluation
All patients had a baseline bidimensional measurement of their tumor. If multiple lesions were present,
the largest lesion was used as the index lesion. This
lesion was monitored on subsequent contrast MRI
scans for response to chemotherapy. Patients with
stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) received 2 more treatment cycles
with temozolomide followed by another assessment
of response. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all radiographically measurable lesions that
was sustained for at least 4 weeks. PR was defined as
a 50% but <100% reduction in the enhancing component of all brain lesions without the appearance of
any new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) was
defined as a 25% increase in the enhancing tumor
or the appearance of new lesions. SD described all
other situations (ie, <25% volume reduction of all

weeks). For CR, PR, and SD, the patient had to be on
a stable or decreased corticosteroid dose and demonstrate stable or improved neurologic function. All data
were analyzed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis.

Statistical Analysis
Patients were separated into 3 groups according to
tumor histology: GBM, AA, and AO. Baseline characteristics of all patients were summarized using descriptive statistics. The response rate and median
PFS were estimated with a 95% confidence interval
(95% CI). The Cox proportional hazards regression
(HR) model was used to correlate each potential
prognostic factor with survival in univariate analyses
within each histologic stratum. A variable selection
procedure was conducted based on Collett,23 and a
logistic regression model was used to identify important factors for objective clinical responses (CR or
PR). Data were collated based on ITT analysis.
The actual accrual was different from the
planned accrual in the original protocol; therefore,
the post hoc power for each histological group was
recomputed based on the observed median PFS and
a 1-sided Wald test at a .05 level under exponential survival. The probability of death in each group was computed using formula (9.12) published in Collett.23

of treatment was 50 years (range, 24–77 years). Histologic diagnosis was GBM in 68 patients (57%), AA in
28 patients (23%), and AO in 24 patients (20%). All
but 2 patients (98%) had received previous radiation
treatment, and 69 patients (58%) had progressed on
or after previous chemotherapy, which did not
include temozolomide. The majority of patients
(n 5 79; 66%) were treated at the time of first recurrence; 26 patients (22%) were treated at second recurrence, and 15 patients (13%) were treated at third
recurrence. No patients were naive to radiation or
chemotherapy.
A median of 4 temozolomide treatment cycles
(range, 1–20 cycles) per patient was administered. All
patients discontinued study treatment because of
disease progression; there were no discontinuations
because of adverse events or hematologic toxicity.

Efficacy Evaluation
Response outcomes by tumor histology (ITT population) are summarized in Table 3. The overall

responders (85%) achieved their best response after
2 cycles of chemotherapy. The median duration of
response was 6 months for GBM, 17 months for AO,
and 10 months for AA. Eleven percent of responders
achieved best response after 4 cycles, 3% after
6 cycles, and 1% after 8 cycles. By the end of the
study, 31 responders experienced disease progression;
however, at the time of last follow-up, 24 patients
were alive, 21 of whom remained free of disease progression. The median follow-up for all patients was
21 months.
The 6-month PFS rate was 43% for all patients.
Based on tumor histology, the 6-month PFS was 35%
for GBM patients, 50% for AA patients, and 58% for
AO patients (Table 4). The median PFS was 5 months
and the median OS was 11 months for all patients
combined. The median PFS was 4 months for GBM
patients, 6 months for AA patients, and 8 months for
AO patients, which was comparable to or slightly
improved compared with historical controls; however, the median PFS was not improved by 50%,
which was the primary objective of this study.
Among the 45 responders (CR 1 PR), the median
time to progression was 8 months for GBM patients,
12 months for AA patients, and 19 months for AO
patients. For all patients, the 6-month survival rate
was 71% for GBM patients, 86% for AA patients, and
75% for AO patients. The 12-month survival rates
were 35%, 59%, and 71% for GBM patients, AA
patients, and AO patients, respectively.

recurrences. The association between response and
histology was not statistically significant (chi-square
test: P 5 .42). The number of prior recurrences was
the only significant factor for PFS. Surprisingly, a
high number of prior recurrences was found to be
correlated with a reduced risk of disease progression
(HR, 0.75; P 5 .03). The impact of this factor on OS
was similar but did not reach statistical significance
(HR, 0.83; P 5 .16). Age was the only factor significantly affecting OS, with an HR of 1.0 (P 5 .04).

Safety of the Twice-Daily Regimen
Of the 624 total treatment cycles, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia were observed
in 3.6%, 1.1%, and 0.3% of cycles, respectively. Overall, 18% of patients experienced a grade 3/4 toxicity.
Grade 1/2 lymphopenia was observed in approximately 35% of the patients; no grade 3/4 lymphopenia or opportunistic infections occurred.
There were 2 treatment-related deaths. One
patient died of septicemia while neutropenic; the
other died with severe thrombocytopenia. One
patient experienced a transient myelodysplastic syndrome after 1 cycle of chemotherapy. Doses were
escalated for 20 patients with no grade 3/4 toxicities.
Eleven patients (9%) required dose reduction for
transient hematologic toxicity. No dose delays were
required because of hematologic toxicity. It is interesting to note that no correlation was found between
the severity of hematologic toxicities and previous
chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
The optimal dosing regimen for temozolomide
remains unknown. On the basis of studies suggesting
increased AGAT depletion and increased clinical efficacy with more frequent or prolonged exposure to
temozolomide, different treatment regimens have

1143

been investigated. These include temozolomide daily
for 7 days on and 7 days off,24,25 daily for 3 weeks on
and 1 week off,24 and daily for 6 or 7 weeks followed
by 4 weeks off.14 When compared with the standard
once-daily dosing regimen, these extended temozolomide dosing schedules resulted in a 2.1-fold to 2.8fold14,24 greater drug exposure (ie, total dose per
cycle). They were also associated with significant
decreased AGAT activity in PMBCs (ie, 72% decrease
on Day 7 and recovery to only 55% of baseline before
dosing on Day 15 in a trial of a 7 days-on/off schedule24). Moreover, the safety profile of temozolomide
using extended dosing schedules was similar to the
standard once-daily, 5-day dosing schedule.
The twice-daily dosing regimen in this phase 2
study was based on a phase 1 study in which a bolus
dose of 200 mg/m2 of temozolomide was followed by
9 consecutive doses given every 12 hours to patients
with metastatic tumors.17 The rationale for twicedaily dosing after an initial loading dose was that
AGAT activity may partially recover by 24 hours. Gerson et al.17 initially reported that a twice-daily regimen resulted in a >90% reduction in AGAT activity
in PBMCs at 24 hours, compared with only 50% in
those receiving once-daily dosing. As a caveat, this
and a second study from Gerson’s group, which
measured AGAT activity from pretreatment and posttreatment tumor biopsies, showed that AGAT depletion
in tumor tissue was variable and did not correlate with
depletion of AGAT activity in PBMCs.17,26 Therefore,
although it is possible that AGAT depletion in brain
tumors may be enhanced by twice-daily dosing, as
noted in PBMCs, there is no clear evidence that this is
the case in tumors.
The results from the current study indicate that
the temozolomide twice-daily regimen has clinical
efficacy in the treatment of recurrent high-grade gliomas, achieving response rates that compare favorably
with those reported by others in similar patient
populations, with a safety profile that is comparable
to the standard once-daily regimen.10,11,19–21 A summary of phase 2 studies that used the standard oncedaily temozolomide dosing regimen18 for recurrent
gliomas is shown in Table 5. It is important to note
that clinical studies that make a direct comparison
between different temozolomide dosing regimens
have not been published to date; therefore, caution
must be exercised in comparing data from these studies. However, some of the efficacy endpoints evaluated in this phase 2 study suggest that twice-daily
temozolomide dosing might provide some advantage
over the standard dosing regimen. For example,
the 6-month PFS and OS rates for GBM patients in
the current study were 35% and 71%, respectively,

compared with 21% and 60% reported by Yung
et al.11 with the once-daily 5-day regimen (note: PFS
was 1 of the primary objectives of that study). In
addition, the overall response rate of 31% observed
in our GBM patients was greater than that reported
by Yung et al. (5%),11 Harris et al. (20%),10 and Brada
et al. (8%).20 Three CRs (5%) were achieved in our GBM
patients on twice-daily temozolomide, whereas no CRs
were observed in 2 of the 3 studies where GBM patients
received the once-daily temozolomide dosing. The
results of the current study are particularly striking
given that the pivotal trial of temozolomide in patients
with recurrent GBM reported by Yung et al.11 restricted
eligible patients to those in first recurrence, whereas
the present study enrolled patients at first (66%), second (22%), and third (13%) recurrence.
The survival rates of the GBM subgroup in the
current study also compare favorably with those
observed with extended-dosing regimens of temozolomide, which, as discussed earlier, demonstrated
promise in phase 1 studies based on significant
AGAT depletion in PMBCs. The Khan et al.21 trial of

6 weeks on/4 weeks off and the Wick et al.27 study of
a 7 days on/7 days off regimen reported 6-month
PFS for GBM patients of 19% and 48%, respectively,
as compared with 35% in this study. A randomized
intergroup study (RTOG 0525) is comparing 2 schedules of temozolomide for patients with newly diagnosed GBMs. Patients will receive either standard
daily for 5 days or an extended schedule in which
patients receive drug for 21 days of a 28-day cycle.
A direct comparison of the results for recurrent
AA and AO from the current study with reported
data are also possible. However, to our knowledge
only 2 published clinical studies provided data for
pure AA or AO histologies, whereas most other studies combined AA or AOs with tumors of mixed histology. In the study reported by Yung et al.,18 the
overall response rate for AA patients was 34% compared with 46% in the current study. The median
PFS (6 months) and OS (15 months) observed in the
present study for AA were comparable to those
reported for AA patients in the Yung study18 (5.5 and
14.2 months, respectively).

Twice-Daily Temozolomide for Recurrent Glioma/Balmaceda et al.

In the study reported by van den Bent et al.,28
which used the standard once-daily 5-day schedule,
the overall response rate in patients with recurrent
AO was 30% compared with 46% in our study. The
median OS was 7 months for patients with AO in
that study,28 whereas in the present study, median
OS for patients with AO was 18 months. These
results suggest that the twice-daily regimen is at least
as efficacious, if not better than, once-daily dosing in
patients with recurrent AA and AO, but this is based
on very limited data.
A parallel comparison of the demographics and
baseline patient characteristics of the current study
with those from the 2 studies discussed above was
performed to identify any potential confounding factors that may account for the difference in response
rates. The median age and percentage of chemotherapy-naive patients in the study of AA and AO
reported by Yung et al.18 (42 years and 40%, respectively) were comparable to that for the current AA
and AO populations. The median age in the GBM
study by Yung et al.11 (52 years) is comparable to our
GBM population. An interesting difference between
the studies by Yung et al.11,18 and the present study
is that Yung’s studies were restricted to patients at
first recurrence of disease. Because the current study
did not have this restriction, 34% of the total study
population was in their second or third recurrence.
In summary, the results of the current study with
twice-daily dosing of temozolomide compare favorably with published reports of patients with recurrent
gliomas, particularly with respect to response and
PFS in patients with GBM, and suggest that a twicedaily dosing regimen is an effective treatment schedule in the recurrent setting and is associated with
less hematologic toxicity than the dose-dense regimens that deliver a 2-fold higher dose per cycle.
Based on these findings, phase 3 testing of twicedaily versus once-daily dosing is warranted. Pending
confirmation of the benefits of twice-daily dosing,
this regimen could potentially be used as an alternative to the standard once-daily dosing schedule during the adjuvant phase of chemoradiotherapy for
newly diagnosed malignant glioma or as second-line
therapy either in patients not previously treated with
temozolomide or possibly in those achieving a good
initial response to first-line temozolomide. The
twice-daily dosing regimen many have several advantages over once-daily dosing, including the potential
to deplete MGMT more effectively and increased
response rates, particularly in patients with GBM.
The responses observed in the present study were
long-lasting for patients with GBM, with some
patients maintaining a PR or SD for 20 months. Up

1145

to 4 to 6 cycles may be necessary before a response
is achieved, and this should be considered when
determining whether or not to continue temozolomide. Further studies of alternative temozolomide
dosing regimens to optimize treatment efficacy are
warranted.
