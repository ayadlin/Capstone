ABSTRACT
Immune tolerance to self-antigens can limit robust anti-tumor immune responses
in the use of tumor vaccines. Expression of novel tumor associated antigens can
improve immune recognition and lysis of tumor cells. The cancer-testis antigen (CTA)
family of proteins has been hypothesized to be an ideal class of antigens due to tumorrestricted expression, a subset of which have been found to induce antibody responses
in patients with prostate disease. We demonstrate that CTA expression is highly
inducible in five different Prostate Cancer (PC) cell lines using a hypomethylating
agent 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5AZA) and/or a histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589.
These CTAs include NY-ESO1, multiple members of the MAGE and SSX families and
NY-SAR35. A subset of CTAs is synergistically induced by the combination of 5AZA
and LBH589. We developed an ex vivo organ culture using human PC biopsies for ex
vivo drug treatments to evaluate these agents in clinical samples. These assays found
significant induction of SSX2 in 9/9 distinct patient samples and NY-SAR35 in 7/9
samples. Further, we identify expression of SSX2 in circulating tumor cells (CTC) from
patients with advanced PC. These results indicate that epigenetic modifying agents
can induce expression of a broad range of neoantigens in human PC and may serve
as a useful adjunctive therapy with novel tumor vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

the expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) in
the context of MHC class I for a CD8 T cell mediated
anti-tumor immune response [7]. Expanding cancer
immunotherapies to a broader range of patients could be
achieved through novel target identification and vaccine
development. Classical PC antigens currently in clinical
trials include prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid
phosphatase (PAP), androgen receptor (AR) and prostatespecific membrane antigen (PSMA) (NCT00583752,
NCT00849121, NCT00694551).
Most notable is Sipuleucel-T, a dendritic cell vaccine
with PAP as the target antigen, which improved survival in
men with metastatic castration-resistant PC (CRPC) [8–10].
Advanced clinical trials are also evaluating the efficacy of
agents targeting PSA (PROSTVAC-VF) [11] as well as
PSMA (NCT02693860, NCT02552394) with promising

While often described as an indolent or treatable
disease, prostate cancer (PC) remains the most common
cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death
in US men (www.cdc.gov/uscs), as well as the cause of
considerable morbidity. The sequential and concurrent
use of hormonal and chemotherapies have been shown
to improve survival for patients with advanced PC [1].
Resistance to these agents, unfortunately, is inevitable,
and there is therefore a critical need to develop novel
treatments [2]. Recent advances in immunotherapies,
including anti-cancer vaccines (prostate cancer) [3]
and checkpoint inhibitors (melanoma, lung and renal
cancers) [4–6] have been shown to improve survival for
patients with advanced disease. These therapies rely on

results [12, 13]. However, the therapeutic potential in
targeting these antigens may be limited for multiple
reasons including 1) targeting “self antigens” to which the
immune system may already be tolerized; 2) heterogeneous
expression of target antigens in advanced disease; and 3)
the ability of PC cells to escape immune detection via
decreased expression of target antigens [14, 15].
An ideal tumor antigen is one to which the immune
system is naïve and whose expression can be persistently
induced in tumor cells. One class of TAAs that meet these
criteria are the cancer testis antigens (CTAs). CTAs are a
family of genes that are characterized by tissue-restricted
expression to MHC class I deficient germline cells. CTAs
are commonly expressed during early development and
undergo epigenetic silencing in adult tissue, except in
testis where they drive the gametogenic program. CTAs
have also been identified in cancer and are expressed
during the process of tumorigenesis and metastases via
multiple mechanisms, including epigenetic alterations
[16, 17]. To date, over 100 CTA families have been
identified and 275 individual genes registered in the CTA
Database (also referred to as CTPedia, www.cta.lncc.br)
[18–20]. The role of CTAs in tumor progression is poorly
understood but may include enhancement of the cell
cycle, expression of mitotic machinery or suppression of
apoptosis signaling cascades. Expression of these antigens
in cancerous cells is quite variable. While some CTAs are
especially prevalent in advanced or metastatic disease
[21] such as SSX2 [22], significant heterogeneity in the
expression profile of CTAs has been observed between
different cancers including PC, tumor loci within the same
host, or even within the same lesion [23–25].
The expression of CTAs in malignancy is heavily
regulated by epigenetic alterations [17, 26, 27]. Cancerous
cells demonstrate extensive hypermethylation of CTA
gene promoter regions [28–31], and modulation of the
epigenetic profile with the use of hypomethylating agents
has been shown to strongly induce expression of CTAs
in various types of cancer, including breast, colorectal,
and ovarian in vitro [32] as well as in vivo. In a Phase
II study in multiple myeloma, the hypomethylating agent
azacitidine led to a significant increase of CTAs in the
bone marrow compared to pre-treatment samples [33].
Interestingly, the considerable influence of epigenetic
modifications on CTA expression appears to be unique
to cancer cells. In studies using colon, skin, and prostate
tissues, alterations in methylation status of CTA promoter
sites was sufficient to induce expression of CTAs in tumor
but not in normal epithelial cells [34–36].
The restricted expression pattern of CTAs in cancer
cells and the ability to selectively augment expression with
epigenetic modifying agents (EMAs) suggest that these
antigens may be ideal immunotherapeutic targets for
vaccine-based therapies. Prior work in a cohort of patients
with prostatitis or prostate cancer identified antibodies
against CTAs and were suggested to be potential
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

autoimmune targets in prostate disease [37–40]. Novel
anti-cancer vaccines targeting various CTAs have been
developed across a wide variety of malignancies. These
agents have demonstrated promising results in preclinical
models and many have advanced to clinical trials. Early
data suggest that these vaccines are overall well tolerated
as well as efficacious. A seven peptide vaccine targeting
CTAs in colon cancer resulted in disease stability or
improvement in 60% of participants with colorectal cancer
[41], and multiple vaccines in biliary cancer have been
associated with stable disease in 50% or more of trial
participants [42, 43], all with limited toxicities in Phase
I trials. Furthermore, in Phase II studies, evaluation of a
prime and boost vaccination strategy targeting the CTA,
NY-ESO1, in late-stage melanoma and ovarian cancer
demonstrated clinically meaningful responses [44], and
in patients with advanced esophageal cancer, immune
responses induced by a CTA vaccine resulted in improved
survival [45]. These new therapeutic vaccines could be of
use in multiple disease types if the target of interest was
expressed.
The goal of this study was to determine the
expression pattern and inducibility of CTAs in human PC.
Expression patterns of 29 potentially immunologically
relevant CTAs were evaluated in 5 PC cell lines of which
21 CTAs were induced following treatment with EMAs.
This expression pattern varied across different CTAs and
was at least partially related to the androgen sensitivity
of these cell lines. Human PC biopsies showed almost no
expression of SSX2 or NY-SAR35 at baseline but could
be significantly induced following treatment with EMAs.
Gene expression analysis of CTAs in circulating tumor
cells further identified a subset of patients with metastatic
PC that could benefit from vaccines targeting CTAs.
These results identify a translational paradigm in which
combining EMAs with CTA-targeted vaccines in patients
with PC can enhance immune-mediated tumor lysis.

RESULTS
Expression of CTAs in vitro
We evaluated 29 CTAs that had previously been
identified in patients with prostate disease using antibody
screening methodology and may be immunologically
relevant in prostate cancer (Table 1) [37–40, 46, 47].
We tested baseline expression of these 29 CTAs in three
AR-expressing PC cell lines (22rv1, LNCaP, LAPC4),
two androgen-independent cell lines (PC3, DU145)
and a benign prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1)
(Figure 1). Among the 29 CTAs selected for this study,
there were 22 X-linked and 7 non-X linked antigens.
The relative expression of CTA mRNA to internal
control transcript RPLP0 (P0) showed considerable
variation across cell lines, in both expression levels
and the range of CTAs detected. From the SSX family,

SSX2 was detected in all PC cell lines except PC3.
Notably, AR-expressing PC cell lines, particularly 22rv1
and LNCaP expressed higher levels of SSX2 than the
two androgen-independent lines chosen for this study
(Figure 1 and Figure S2). The MAGE-A family members
were detected across several cell lines with MAGE-A3
and MAGE-A4 highly expressed in AR-expressing cells
lines, not detectable in DU145, and detectable in PC3
cells at lower levels. Among the non-X linked CTAs, both
LIP1 and SPA17 were expressed across all tested cell
lines. Taken together, AR-expressing cell lines expressed
higher levels and higher diversity of CTAs compared to
androgen-independent PC cell lines and normal epithelial
cells. Additionally, eleven of the CTAs chosen in this
study had detectable expression in at least one PC cell
line but not in RWPE-1 (SSX1, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A2,
MAGE-A8, MAGE-B1, GAGE-2, NY-ESO1, NYSAR35, NXF-2, XAGE-1 and SPANXC), and twelve were
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

undetectable in all cell lines tested (MAGE-E1, GAGE4, GAGE-7, PAGE-1, LAGE-1, SSX5, FATE-1, TPX-1,
MAD-CT1, MAD-CT2, ADAM2 and TSP50).

EMAs induce CTA expression in vitro
Epigenetic modification has been previously
shown to be a key factor in regulation of CTA expression
[17, 26, 27, 37]. We tested if EMAs shown to induce CTA
expression in other tumor types could have a similar effect
in PC. We utilized the hypomethylating agent 5AZA and/
or the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor LBH589 to
induce CTA expression in PC cell lines (Figures 2 and 3).
Data is also shown in bar graphs in Supplementary Figures
S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 depicting statistical significance
between treatment groups.
In both androgen-independent cell lines (DU145
and PC3) (Figure 3), combinatorial treatment significantly

increased SSX2 expression relative to baseline. Although
there was some limited induction of SSX2 in LNCaP and
LAPC4 cells, epigenetic treatment was much less effective
in AR-expressing cell lines (Figure 2). Both SSX1 and
SSX5 were inducible (Figure S2. top row, left panel and
bottom row, left panel, respectively) by combination
treatments across all cell lines, though at much lower
expression levels than SSX2. Similarly, a significant
increase of protein expression of the SSX family was also
detected in PC3, DU145 and in LAPC4 cells following
combinatorial treatment (Figure S2, bottom right panel).

Combinatorial treatments resulted in a significant
induction of most MAGE-A family members in
most cell lines tested (Figures 2 and 3, shown as bar
graphs in Supplementary Figure S1). MAGE-A1 and
MAGE-A4 were both induced across all cell lines with
the exception of LAPC4 cells. Additionally, they were
both highly induced in 22rv1 cells on top of very high
baseline expression, resulting in the highest expression
levels detected after epigenetic treatments for all
CTAs tested. However, MAGE-A1 expression levels
remained near the detection limit in RWPE-1 cells after

all treatments. While MAGE-A3 was induced in DU145
by both 5AZA alone and combination treatments,
it remained undetectable in PC3 cells, and the ARexpressing cells lines showed limited induction of this
tumor antigen. We also evaluated other members of the
MAGE family (Figures 2, 3, Supplementary Figure S1
and S3). MAGE-A8 had relevant expression only
in LNCaP cells, and expression was not affected by
EMAs. Although both MAGE-B1 and MAGE-B2
baseline expression stayed close to or under detection
limit across all the analyzed cells lines, both 5AZA
and combination treatments rescued MAGE-B1 and
MAGE-B2 in all the PC cell lines while RWPE-1 cells
were only induced by high dose combination treatment.
MAGE-B2 expression was very highly induced by
combinatorial treatments in the androgen-independent
cell lines.
While NY-SAR35 expression was only detected
in LNCaP cells at baseline and at a relatively low level,
combinatorial treatment highly induced its expression
across all PC cell lines but only moderately in the benign
prostate cell line. Combinatorial treatments also resulted

in a significant increase of NY-ESO1 expression across
all cell lines with the exception of 22rv1, which had
the highest baseline expression of NY-ESO1 prior to
treatment. Additionally, LBH589 alone resulted in a
significant increase of NY-ESO1 expression over vehicle
in 22rv1 cells. Of the other CTAs studied, GAGE2,
PAGE5, XAGE1, NXF2, SPANXC, and MADCT2 were
all notable for being significantly induced across all PC
cell lines tested. In RWPE1 cells, however, XAGE1,
NXF2, SPANXC and MADCT2 expression all remained
near or below the detection limit.

Epigenetic treatment induces CTA expression in
human PC ex vivo
In order to determine if epigenetic treatments
may enhance CTA expression in a more clinically
relevant model, we utilized a novel ex vivo prostate
tumor culture system (Figure 4) to treat tumor
biopsies collected from 9 patients undergoing radical
prostatectomy (Figure 5). To validate this model, we
measured the expression levels of AR and PAP which

an internal control transcript (P0) following EMA treatment of RWPE-1, LNCaP, LAPC4, and 22rv1 cells. qRT-PCR was performed using
primers specific for each gene, conducted in triplicate, and repeated in an independent experiment. Expression relative to P0 was color
scaled from red (highest) to black (middle; 50th percentile) to green (lowest) for each CTA separately, across all cell lines, thus similar
colors between different rows cannot be directly compared. Grey indicates that no relevant expression was detected.

are the targets of other vaccine therapies [48]. Baseline
PAP expression was detectable in all 9 patient samples
and 7 out of 9 samples had detectable expression of
AR (bottom row, right panel). In concordance with
in vitro studies (Supplementary Figure S6), EMAs had a
limited impact on AR expression in this model though a
subset of patient samples showed variable induction and
repression of the AR pathway. In 7 patients, epigenetic

treatment enhanced PAP expression in prostate tumor tissue
following at least one treatment condition (bottom row, left
panel). Interestingly, LBH589 alone increased PAP in 3
samples, similar to that observed evaluating PSA in the
Phase I clinical trial with this agent in men with PC [49].
SSX2 mRNA was only detected in 1 out of 9
patients’ tumor tissue cultures at baseline (Figure 5, top
row, left panel). However, epigenetic treatments induced

DISCUSSION

resulted in robust expression of SSX2 in 8 patient samples.
NYSAR35 was not detected in any prostate tumor tissue
cultures at baseline (top row, right panel). Three out of five
prostate tumor cultures responded to 5AZA alone while
LBH589 alone did not have any effect on NYSAR35
expression. Five patient tumor samples showed a
synergistic impact on NYSAR35 expression following
combinatorial treatment with 5AZA and LBH589. Taken
together, our results indicate, that epigenetic treatment has
the potential to increase CTA expression levels in tumor
lesions in situ in human PC.

Recent advances in immune therapies have
improved survival for patients with advanced PC, though
with limited success to date. One major limitation of
these agents is the lack of immunogenic, non-tolerizing
target antigens expressed by tumor cells. CTAs have
been identified as promising TAAs due to their restricted
expression and immunogenicity [50–52]. Previous studies
have identified heterogeneous expression of CTAs in a
wide variety of cancers, including primary PC [52–54].
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that EMAs can
induce expression of immunologically potentially relevant
CTAs in human PC. We detected expression of 19 of the
29 tested CTAs across five PC cell lines with relatively
high expression of multiple MAGE-A family members,
SSX2, NY-ESO1, GAGE-2, XAGE-1, LIP1 and SPA17.
An analytic review of Gene Expression Omnibus Data
(GEOD) on urological malignancies by Kulkarni et al.
[54] also showed a heterogenous panel of CTAs expressed
in prostate cancer, with numerous MAGE-A and MAGE-B
CTAs detected, similarly to a recent study by Maxfield et
al. which analyzed the LNCaP cell line [16]. SSX family
members were also detected with SSX2 and SSX4 (not
analyzed in this report) being identified in the Kulkarni
review [54] but not detected in LNCaPs in the Maxfield
study [16]. Similar to our findings, SSX1, NXF-2 and
SPANXC were also found in PC by this analysis. However,
ADAM2, SSX5, PAGE1, TPX-1 (CRISP2), PRM2
(MAD-CT1) were detectable in PC in this report and not
detected at baseline among our model cell lines suggesting
considerable heterogeneity in the CTA repertoire within
PC. NY-ESO1, NY-SAR35, XAGE-1, GAGE2 and
PAGE5 were all detected in at least 1 cell line in this study
but not reported in the above GEOD analysis [16, 54].
This is the first report of inducible expression of PAGE5
which has previously been detected at low levels in 3 of
12 prostate carcinoma samples in the Human Protein Atlas
[55] (http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000158639PAGE5/cancer/tissue/prostate+cancer) and trace amounts
of PAGE5 was also detected in the PC3 cell line (http://
www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000158639-PAGE5/cell).
In comparison, the LNCaP, LAPC4 and 22rv1 cell
lines expressed a larger repertoire of CTAs, including
at least 8 antigens each while PC3 and DU145 cells
expressed a smaller palette of CTAs. Similar complexity
was also reflected in the study of Maxfield et al. on the
LNCaP cell line [16]. This heterogeneity is not surprising
given prior studies evaluating CTA expression in clinical
samples. For example, CTA expression levels and patterns
highly correlate with advanced disease [22, 56], with
microarray studies identifying significant differences in
SSX2 expression between primary and metastatic PC
lesions. A serum IgG screening study of patients with
PC [36] detected a variety of antibodies specific to CTAs

Promoter methylation in SSX2 expression
We observed that SSX2 expression is considerably
variable across PC cell lines with relatively high
expression in LNCaP and 22rv1 cells and very low or
undetectable expression in all others. To see if differences
in baseline expression and responsiveness to treatment is
reflected in methylation levels of the SSX2 promoter, we
first conducted bisulfite genomic sequencing of promoter
CpG islands of untreated DU145, LNCaP and 22rv1
cells (Supplementary Figure S7.). We analyzed two CpG
islands separately, one from +940 to +664 and the other
from +133 to −51, both relative to the transcriptional
start site. Among the three cell lines analyzed, DU145
showed the highest methylation levels that correlated
with near absent gene expression. However, methylation
levels did not clearly associate with SSX2 expression
levels in the LNCaP and 22rv1 cell lines. Similarly,
methylation analysis of these cell lines at the +133 to
−51 loci following treatment with 5AZA and/or LBH589
treatments did not reveal significant alterations, suggesting
promoter methylation at these loci is not the sole factor
controlling expression of SSX2.

CTA as a potential biomarker for systemic
disease
Next, we obtained peripheral blood samples from
11 patients diagnosed with PC (with variable disease
status). EpCAM+ cells were isolated from CD45−
enriched buffy coats. We performed a qPCR microarray
on the enriched CTCs, which showed a strong baseline
expression of prostate specific markers, including PAP in
all and AR and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) in 10 out
of 11 patients (Figure 6). Further prostate specific markers
were analyzed including PSA and prostate specific
membrane antigen (PSMA). PSA was only detected in
one patient while PSMA was expressed in 4 out of 11 CTC
samples. Cytokeratin 8 was used to confirm tumor cells
present in the isolates. CTCs from 2 out of 11 patients had
detectable levels of SSX2 mRNA. In conclusion, SSX2
may be expressed in PC both in situ in tumor tissue and in
circulating tumor cells.

including NY-ESO-1, LAGE-1, NXF-2 and SSX-2,
suggesting that a variety of CTAs are expressed on PC
cells. Induction of CTA-specific immune response limits
tumor growth as demonstrated in preclinical studies [57]
and have shown some promising clinical benefits in
various tumor models [58, 59].
The heterogeneous expression of CTAs theoretically
limits the utility of this class of TAAs due to absent or
aberrant expression in patient tumors. Multiple studies on
genome-wide epigenetic analysis have demonstrated that
silencing of CTAs is associated with tumor pathogenesis
and that there is hypermethylation of CTA promoter
regions in multiple cancer types [28–31]. Chemical
reversal of epigenetic silencing through the use of EMAs
has been shown in melanoma to induce CTA expression,
restore immune recognition and promote tumor clearance
[25, 28, 29, 35, 36, 60–62]. Similarly, we identified this
phenomenon in PC using hypomethylating agents alone
or in combination with an HDAC inhibitor. Both additive
and synergistic increases in CTA expression occurred in all
cell lines following treatment with both EMAs, inducing
homogenous expression patterns in CTAs across all PC
cell lines. Furthermore, our results suggest promoter
methylation is not the sole mechanism by which EMAs
induce CTA expression. Previous studies suggest that
epigenetic regulation of certain genes may be the result
of core histone modification that results in the increase of
spatial availability for transcription [63]. Gene expression
may also be the result of demethylation of regions outside
of the promoter that were not analyzed in our study. We
observed that AR-expressing cell lines responded less to
epigenetic treatment while androgen-independent cell

lines were more inducible. This finding is in accordance
with those of Suyama et al. [56], who reported that
MAGE-A2 expression was rescued in non-expressing PC3
and DU145 cell lines with a remarkably high fold-change
over vehicle while LNCaP and CWR22 were not inducible
by 5AZA.
To evaluate the translational relevance of these
findings, we developed a novel approach to test EMAs
in human cancer with an ex vivo tissue culture with
human PC specimens. Similar drug cultures were used
by Centenera et al. [64] to test biological responses
to novel HSP90 inhibitors in PC. This study observed
biological effects of these drugs not yet observed in
preceding experiments done on cell lines and in animal
models suggesting the value of ex vivo drug cultures as
a potentially more appropriate preclinical model for
rational selection of therapeutic agents. The absence
of CTA expression in vehicle treated samples matches
previously published work in tissue microarrays. Similar
to the in vitro results, EMAs induced expression of SSX2
and NYSAR35 in primary human PC tissue culture. This
pattern of responses identifies anticipated heterogeneity
in primary human PC that can be modified through the
use of EMAs. These results did not address the durability
of this response or the optimal frequency of treatment to
induce alterations in gene expression and is the subject
of ongoing experiments. This model is also well suited
to screen novel EMAs in development for synergistic
alterations in CTA expression. These results identify a
strategy in which combinatorial epigenetic treatments can
induce a large palette of tumor-selective neoantigens as
part of a multifaceted immunotherapeutic strategy to treat

PC. Multi-epitope immune targeting therapy of prostatespecific epitopes have been studied and shown efficient
at boosting cellular immune responses in multiple studies
in PC [65]. Additionally, antigen spreading after efficient
single-epitope vaccination correlating with improved
overall survival has been also shown in PC [66]. The
induction of polyclonal anti-tumor response against
multiple CTAs on prostate tumor cells may promote
more efficient effector mechanisms, higher intensity of
overall immune responses and more successful tumor
targeting. A Phase I clinical trial (NCT106158) enrolling
patients with NY-ESO-1 expressing tumors including
8 advanced esophageal and 2 PC patients immunized
with recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein found a heteroclitic
immune response to 10 CTAs in addition to NY-ESO-1
protein following immunization [51]. Although the limited
number of patients did not allow the investigators to
establish clear correlation between CTA-specific immune
responses and clinical outcomes in that study, other studies
with the same NY-ESO-1 recombinant protein vaccine
enrolling patients with Stage IV esophageal, Stage D3 PC,
or Stage IV melanoma detected both antibody, CD4 an
CD8 T cell responses against the vaccine protein, which
associated with beneficial clinical effects such as tumor
regression or stable disease for a prolonged time in six of
seven evaluable patients. PSA levels temporarily stabilized
in 3 of 4 PC patients with recurrent hormone-refractory
tumors [58]. Additionally, vaccine studies utilizing CTAs
[59] and other tumor-associated targets have suggested
the association of clinical response with the detection of
multi-epitope cellular and humoral immune responses
against antigens other than the original vaccine epitope
[67]. These results suggest that biological doses of EMAs
may result in expression of a large palette of CTAs in
PC cells and potentially synergize with other immune
therapies to enhance tumor lysis.
These results support a rationale to utilize currently
available vaccines targeting CTAs in combination with
EMAs. However, the timing and appropriate dose of
EMAs in this context is unknown. This is even more
critical of an issue with this class of drugs as clinical
benefit from hypomethylating agents was not observed
until these agents were administered below the maximally
tolerated dose. The potential for biomarkers using CTCs
may allow real-time monitoring of gene expression
alterations to identify an optimal biologic dose for this
specific context of use. We demonstrate proof-in-concept
data identifying expression of SSX2 in EpCAM positive
circulating tumor cells from patients with advanced
PC. Gene expression analysis identified expression of
multiple PC specific genes demonstrating the specificity
of this assay and is consistent with prior studies showing
preferential expression of SSX2 in metastatic lesions
[22]. SSX2 has been previously proposed as a promising
vaccine target in PC [52, 57] and is being evaluated as
part of a combination immunotherapy regimen in a Phase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

I clinical trial (NCT02625857) for men with CRPC. Our
finding is in accordance with a recent report by Bloom et
al. detecting SSX2 mRNA in 19 of 54 (35%) of CD45−/
EpCAM+/CD63+ circulating tumor cell samples in
PC patients [68]. Our detection was lower at 2 out of
11 (18%). Our study has also been sampling a narrower
group, patients with advanced PC while the study of
Bloom et al. has analyzed PC patients from a broad
spectrum of disease from newly diagnosed through CRPC.
These studies do not evaluate other EpCAM-negative
events, which may exhibit higher SSX2 expression as this
gene has been associated with epithelial-mesenchymal
transitions [68] that may have been missed in this study.
The extent to which gene expression alterations occur
in CTCs relative to the primary tumor is unknown at
this time but is an easily testable hypothesis through the
integration of paired tumor and blood analytics. Validation
of these assays in prospective clinical trials may further
speed the development of these combination strategies as
well as improve patient stratification for these treatments.
EMAs have become the focus of renewed interest
for development of cancer therapies as preclinical data has
demonstrated potent and wide-ranging anti-tumor effects
when administered in low, biological doses. This study
has demonstrated that PC cells are potent expressors of
novel immunogenic targets in human PC and that EMA
treatments enhance CTA expression and even restore
it in epigenetically silenced androgen-independent PC
cells. This suggests that EMAs may offer a mechanism
to induce tumor-selective CTL epitopes and may promote
more efficient targeting by induction of a multi-epitope
immune response. Exploring if EMAs may enhance
CTA-specific CTL responses and tumor clearance is an
important question to address to evaluate potential future
clinical significance.

Bisulfite genomic sequencing
Genomic DNA was bisulfite converted using the
EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen) and amplified in 50 µL PCR
reactions containing 2 U ZymoTaq DNA polymerase
(Zymo Research), 1x reaction buffer (Zymo Research),
250 µM each dNTPs, 1 µM forward primer, 1 µM reverse
primer, and 50ng bisulfite converted DNA. Three primer
pairs specific for the SSX2 promoter were used: forward

conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles
of 95°C for 30 sec, appropriate annealing temperature for
30 sec, 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension step of 72°C
for 7 min. PCR products were purified using either the
QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) or the QIAquick
gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified products were then
cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), grown on
AMP/IPTG/X-gal plates, cultured in suspension overnight,
collected using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit, and sent
to the UW-Madison Biotechnology Center for standard
Sanger sequencing.

Reagents
5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5AZA) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and Panobinostat
(LBH589) was purchased from Selleckchem (Houston,
TX). Reagents were dissolved and stored in DMSO
freezer aliquots.

Epigenetic drug treatments of cell lines and
human primary tissue cultures

VERSA capture and CTC mRNA extraction
The VERSA-based capture of circulating tumor
cells from peripheral blood samples followed by mRNA
extraction was previously validated and reported by Sperger
et al. [71]. The VERSA device [71–74] was injectionmolded by Proto Labs (USA). Blood samples were
collected from patients consented under the University of
Wisconsin-Madison IRB protocol #XP08813. Blood was
collected into K2EDTA Vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences,
USA) and PBMCs were isolated on Ficoll-Paque (GE,
USA) gradient. PBMCs were then subjected to CD45
depletion following manufacturer’s protocol (Dynabeads,
Life Tech, USA) and the CD45−fraction was incubated with
paramagnetic particles (PMPs) (Dynabeads® FlowComp™
Flexi kit, Life Technologies, USA) coated with EpCAM
antibody (R&D Systems, USA). The PMP-bound cells
were then captured in the VERSA device.
