BACKGROUND: Pixantrone dimaleate (pixantrone) has been shown to have antitumor activity in leukemia and lymphoma in vitro models and to lack delayed cardiotoxicity associated with mitoxantrone in animal models. FND-R, a
combination regimen of fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone, and rituximab, has been shown to be an effective
regimen for low-grade lymphomas. METHODS: This dose-escalation study, with an expansion cohort, was conducted
to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of FPD-R, in which pixantrone was substituted for mitoxantrone in the
FND-R regimen, in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Escalated doses of
pixantrone were administered to newly enrolled patients on day 2 of each 28-day cycle of FPD-R. RESULTS: Twentyeight of 29 enrolled patients received at least 1 cycle of FPD-R (median, 5 cycles). Pixantrone 120 mg/m2 was identified as the recommended dose in this regimen. Grade 3-4 adverse events were primarily hematologic; grade 3-4 lymphopenia occurred in 89% of patients and leukopenia in 79%. No patients developed congestive heart failure or
grade 3-4 cardiac adverse events. Left ventricular ejection fraction decreases occurred in 8 (29%) patients, and most
were grade 1 or 2, transient, and asymptomatic. The overall response rate was 89%. Estimated survival was 96% after
1 year and 92% after 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The FPD-R regimen was well-tolerated and highly active in patients

Non -Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) encompass a group of diverse lymphoid neoplasms ranging from indolent malig-

nancies to rapidly growing, aggressive tumors.1 NHLs collectively rank fifth in cancer incidence and mortality, and the
prevalence of NHL has been increasing during the last 2 decades.1 More than 90% of NHLs are CD20-positive.2 Follicular lymphoma, a B-cell lymphoma, accounts for 22% of cases of NHL and 70% of indolent NHL diagnoses.3
The majority of patients with indolent lymphoma are diagnosed as having advanced-stage disease, which cannot be
cured by any currently available conventional chemotherapy.3 Most of these patients initially respond to therapy, but
responses typically last less than 2 years, whereas patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma have a median survival
of 7 or 8 years.1 Despite its indolent course, most patients with indolent lymphoma ultimately die of the disease.1
In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, investigators compared responses to the combination of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and a standard chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in patients with follicular
lymphoma and other indolent lymphomas.4 Overall, patients who received the rituximab therapy had better response

rates and disease control, as measured by progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), than patients
who received chemotherapy alone. Improved OS was
noted particularly in the follicular lymphoma subgroup.
Combination chemotherapy with fludarabine,
mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone (FND) is a standard
regimen for relapsed or refractory indolent NHL.5 The
addition of rituximab to this regimen (FND-R) is associated with improved response duration in patients with
CD20-positive follicular lymphoma and only modestly
increased neutropenia.5,6 These regimens, however, may
not improve OS in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL.5 In addition, cardiotoxicity and myelosuppression are associated with mitoxantrone, similar to
other anthracyclines, although mitoxantrone has a more
favorable tolerability profile.7,8
Pixantrone is a novel aza-anthracenedione that is
structurally similar to mitoxantrone and anthracyclines,
such as doxorubicin.9 These agents have structures that
include a hydroquinone moiety, which is thought to
induce cardiotoxicity. However, in pixantrone, the hydroquinone is substituted with a pyridine ring to create the
aza derivative, removing structural groups known to bind
intracellular iron and induce free-radical production.10
When tested in vitro, pixantrone exhibited less cytotoxicity than doxorubicin or mitoxantrone,11,12 whereas in animal models, pixantrone was substantially more effective
than either agent, particularly in leukemia and lymphoma
models. Pixantrone was also much less cardiotoxic than
mitoxantrone or doxorubicin.10,13
Single-agent pixantrone demonstrated encouraging
clinical activity and tolerability in phase 1 and 2 studies in
patients with relapsed or refractory NHL14,15 or with solid
tumors.16 Pixantrone also had significant antitumor activity in studies with combination therapies. In 1 such study
(phase 1/2), pixantrone was substituted for etoposide in the
ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin) regimen to treat patients with relapsed
or refractory aggressive NHL.17 The overall response was
58%; the major toxicities were hematologic, and there were
no grade 3-4 cardiac toxicities.
A phase 3 study compared single-agent pixantrone
with investigators’ choice of another single chemotherapeutic agent. Enrolled patients had relapsed or refractory
aggressive NHL (N ¼ 140) and were previously treated
with 2 or more chemotherapy regimens before entering
the study. At the end of treatment, the complete response/
complete response unconfirmed (CR/CRu) rate was
higher for patients treated with pixantrone (20% vs 5.7%;

5068

P ¼ .021), and PFS was longer (median, 4.7 months vs
2.6 months; P ¼ .007).18,19 Consistent with earlier clinical studies, the major toxicity with pixantrone in the phase
3 study was neutropenia.18,19 In addition, some serious
cardiac adverse events occurred in both the pixantrone
and comparator groups (8.8% vs 4.5%) with no clear pattern of treatment-related causality.18
In the dose-escalation phase 1 study described in
this article, patients with relapsed or refractory indolent
NHL were treated with the FPD-R regimen in which pixantrone replaced mitoxantrone. Here, we report the recommended dose of pixantrone to be administered in
combination with fixed doses of fludarabine, dexamethasone, and rituximab, and we also present the safety and efficacy of this treatment regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Inclusion criteria included relapsed or refractory, indolent, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Revised European-American Lymphoma [REAL] classification and World Health
Organization [WHO] classification systems), life expectancy 3 months, WHO performance status of 0 or 1, left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 50% by multiple
gated-acquisition scan (MUGA), and adequate hematologic (neutrophils 1.5  109/L and platelets 100 
109/L), renal (creatinine 1.5 mg/dL), and hepatic (serum
bilirubin 1.5  upper limit of normal [ULN], alkaline
phosphatase 2.0  ULN, and alanine aminotransferase
[ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 2.0 
ULN) functions.
Exclusion criteria included treatment with fludarabine within 12 months of treatment start, prior treatment
with rituximab unless associated with a complete or partial response, prior exposure to doxorubicin >450 mg/m2
or equivalent, radiotherapy or chemotherapy within 4
weeks of treatment start, radioimmunotherapy within 3
months of treatment start, clinically significant cardiovascular or neurologic abnormalities, and pregnancy or lactation. All patients provided written informed consent
indicating that they were aware of the investigational nature of the treatment, and each study site received approval from its local institutional ethics committee.
Study Design and Treatment
This single-arm phase 1 study had a dose-escalation
design and was conducted to identify the recommended

dose of pixantrone and the safety and preliminary efficacy
of the FPD-R regimen.
Pixantrone (Cell Therapeutics Inc, Seattle, Washington) was administered intravenously on day 2 of a 28day cycle, up to 8 cycles, in combination with fludarabine
25 mg/m2 once daily intravenously on days 2 through 4,
dexamethasone 20 mg/day orally on days 1 through 5,
and rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1. The
initial pixantrone dose was 80 mg/m2, which was approximately one-third of the maximum tolerated dose that was
identified in studies with single-agent pixantrone.10 Dose
escalations of pixantrone to 120 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and
180 mg/m2 were planned with newly enrolled patients.
The recommended dose was the dose of pixantrone that
induced moderate bone marrow suppression but no excess
toxicity. Moderate bone marrow suppression was defined
as grade 4 neutropenia, with no fever lasting <7 days, or
platelet count between 50  109/L and 75  109/L with
no bleeding. Once the recommended dose of pixantrone
was identified, investigators treated 19 additional patients,
as specified in the study protocol, to further evaluate the
safety and efficacy of the FPD-R regimen using the recommended dose of pixantrone.
Adverse events were graded according to National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version
2.0)20 and assessed as not related, or as possibly, probably,
or definitely related to study drug. Dose-limiting toxicities
(DLTs) were defined as any of the following adverse events
that occurred during cycles 1 or 2 only: grade 3 febrile neutropenia, grade 4 neutropenia for 7 days, platelet count
<50  109/L with bleeding, any platelet count <50 
109/L that did not recover by day 21 of the cycle, grade 3
nonhematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia), and nausea
and vomiting uncontrolled by supportive measures.
When the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was <1
 109/L or platelet count was 50  109/L on day 28,
the cycle was delayed until recovery to an ANC of 1 
109/L and a platelet count of 50  109/L. If recovery
took >2 weeks, then the subsequent pixantrone dose was
reduced to the previous level (or by 20% when the previous dose of pixantrone was 80 mg/m2), and the dose of
fludarabine was reduced by 20%. Patients were withdrawn from therapy when recovery did not occur after a
4-week delay.
Grade 2 to 4 nonhematologic toxicities (except alopecia and grades 1-3 nausea and vomiting controlled by
supportive measures) required delay of treatment until recovery to grade 1, then retreatment at the same pixantrone
dose. Patients who did not recover after a 2-week delay

were withdrawn from study treatment. For grade 2 toxicities, when a treatment delay was necessary for the same
toxicity on 2 occasions, investigators reduced the doses of
pixantrone and fludarabine as described above for hematological toxicities. For grade 3-4 toxicities, treatment was
delayed as for grade 2 toxicities, and subsequent doses
were reduced similarly when the patient recovered. Study
treatment was discontinued in patients whose grade 3-4
toxicities recurred at the reduced dose.
All cardiac events were reported in the same manner
as serious adverse events. Patients who developed cardiac
toxicities greater than grade 2 were withdrawn from treatment. Those who developed 20% absolute decrease in
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) versus baseline
were withdrawn from treatment even when LVEF values
were in the normal range and patients were asymptomatic.
Patients received prophylaxis (trimethoprim sulfa or
an alternative) for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while
receiving study treatment and for 3 months thereafter.
Bone marrow stimulating factors (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) were administered after cycle 1 according to the
American Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines to
treat leukopenia or neutropenia.21

Patient Evaluations
Physical examinations, clinical chemistry, hematology
evaluations, and urinalysis were completed at baseline,
before each cycle, and at the end-of-treatment visit.
MUGA scans were performed, and serum cardiac troponin T levels were measured at baseline, every 2 cycles, and
at the end-of-treatment visit. If LVEF decreased 10%
from baseline or to <50% during treatment, then a
MUGA scan was performed every cycle thereafter. LVEF
severity was graded according to the National Cancer
Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0.22
Tumor responses (complete response [CR], complete response unconfirmed [CRu], and partial response
[PR]) were evaluated every 2 cycles according to International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for NHL
(1999).23 Responses of any duration and those that were
maintained at least 8 weeks (per protocol) were reported.
All patients were assessed every 3 months for survival and
progression of disease after completion of the study treatment. Patients who completed 1 cycle of therapy were
considered evaluable for response, and all patients who
received any protocol-directed therapy were included in
safety and survival analyses.

RESULTS
Demographics
The baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled in this
study are summarized in Table 1. The percentage of men
and women enrolled in the study was nearly equal, 69%
of all patients were Caucasian, and the median age was 63
years. The WHO performance status was either 0 (52%)
or 1 (48%), a majority of the patients (62%) had follicular
center cell lymphoma at enrollment, all received at least 1
prior antitumor therapy, and 90% were previously treated
with chemotherapy. From December 2001 to October
2004, investigators enrolled 29 adults with histologically
confirmed relapsed or refractory indolent NHL (Table 2).
All enrolled patients received at least 1 prior therapy for
lymphoma: 26 (90%) had chemotherapy, 10 with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone

5070

(CHOP) or CHOP-like regimen, 3 with CHOP-rituximab; 15 (52%) had immunotherapy, a total of 14 patients
with rituximab in a combination regimen or as a singleagent; and 5 (17%) had radiation therapy. One patient
did not receive pixantrone and was excluded from the
safety and efficacy population. Another patient who
received study treatment was diagnosed with diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of NHL, and was
excluded from the efficacy population.
Recommended Dose and Pixantrone
Exposure
Three patients were treated with the FPD-R regimen
using the starting dose of 80 mg/m2 of pixantrone; none
of the 3 patients experienced DLTs. As a result of these
responses, investigators escalated the dose of pixantrone to
120 mg/m2 and continued to enroll and treat patients
until 2 patients had 2 DLTs, 1 patient had a DLT in cycle
1, and the other patient had a DLT in cycle 2. Dose escalation was stopped at this point, and the recommended
dose of pixantrone was identified as 120 mg/m2. Enrollment was expanded by an additional 19 patients, for a total
of 25 patients, so that a sufficient number of patients were
enrolled for further evaluation of the safety and efficacy of
the treatment regimen at the recommended dose (120 mg/
m2 pixantrone). Four of the 25 patients who received the
FPD-R regimen with the recommended dose of pixantrone
experienced DLTs. Three patients had 1 DLT each, and 1
patient had 2 DLTs. Three DLTs occurred in cycle 2, and
2 occurred in cycle 1. Four of the DLTs were nonhematologic, and 1 was hematologic (Table 3).
The 28 evaluated patients underwent a total of 140
cycles of treatment and a median of 5 cycles (min-max, 18). In 5 patients, investigators reduced the dose of pixantrone (from 120 mg/m2 to 96 mg/m2 or 80 mg/m2)

because of adverse events. No deaths occurred during the
study. Two patients died of progressive disease after leaving the study; 1 patient died after 69 days, and another
died 286 days after the study.
Safety
Adverse events that occurred in 30% of patients, regardless
of relation to treatment, are listed in Table 4. All patients in
the safety population experienced at least 1 adverse event,
and all experienced hematologic adverse events. A total of 29
serious adverse events were reported in 16 (57%) patients; in
14 of these patients, serious adverse events were considered
related to treatment. Grades 1-2 decreases in LVEF
accounted for serious adverse events in 8 patients; 2 of these
patients were symptomatic, with transient shortness of
breath that resolved spontaneously without treatment.
Hematologic serious adverse events occurred in 9 patients.
Other than leukopenia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia, the majority of common adverse events were grades
1-2. Grade 3-4 gastrointestinal and grade 3-4 infectious
adverse events, considered at least possibly related to treatment, each occurred in 7 (25%) patients. Study treatment
was discontinued in 9 (32%) patients because of unacceptable toxicity: 4 patients had hematologic adverse
events, 4 patients had grade 1-2 decreases in LVEF, and 1
patient had a rash that developed after administration of
rituximab. This patient did not receive pixantrone or any
other drug from the treatment regimen.
No grade 3-4 cardiovascular events and no episodes of
congestive heart failure (CHF) were reported. Seven of the 8
patients with grade 1-2 decreases in LVEF had a history of
anthracycline exposure (doxorubicin or mitoxantrone). Median prior cumulative doxorubicin-equivalent dose was 540
mg (min-max, 240-675 mg). Other grade 1-2 cardiac events
occurred in 2 (7%) patients: 1 patient had tachycardia, and 1
had palpitations and a small pericardial effusion. Nine
(32%) patients developed grade 1-2 dyspnea.

Time to tumor progression, the time from date of

patients progressed before 300 days, and 3 patients progressed in 600 to 900 days; 20 (74%) patients were censored because they had not progressed at the time of last
contact (Fig. 1). The median time to progression was not
reached when the study was completed.
The OS for the efficacy-evaluable population was also
analyzed. Two patients died of progressive disease on days
69 and 286; 25 (92.6%) patients were censored as they
were alive at last follow-up (Fig. 1). The 1-year survival rate
was 96.3%; 2- and 3-year survival rates were 91.5%.

DISCUSSION
This study was the first to evaluate FPD-R combination
therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent
NHL. FPD-R was well tolerated with patients receiving a
median of 5 cycles of therapy. The primary toxicities with
FPD-R were hematologic with a low incidence of febrile
neutropenia (4%) and no reported serious infections. In
phase 1 and 2 trials with FND, the predominant toxicities
were myelosuppression and infections.24,25
The incidence of cardiac adverse events with FPD-R
appeared acceptable, especially given the high proportion
of patients who had received prior doxorubicin. It is notable that no grade 3-4 cardiovascular adverse events or congestive heart failure were reported in this study. Of the 8
patients who developed grade 1-2 decreases in LVEF in
this study, 7 had prior anthracycline exposure. In comparison, grade 3-4 cardiac adverse events (dyspnea and
decreased LVEF) occurred in 2 of 21 (10%) patients in a
phase 1 study of FND; both of these patients had prior

and overall survival are shown in the efficacy-evaluable population (N ¼ 27). Abbreviations: OS, overall survival; TTP, time

anthracycline exposure.24 In a phase 2 trial of FND in 51
patients, 2 patients developed congestive heart failure, and
1 patient developed an asymptomatic decrease in LVEF; all
had prior anthracycline exposure.25 It will be important to
monitor prior cumulative anthracycline doses and cardiovascular function in future trials of FPD-R.
Although not in the analysis plan, the current status
of 14 patients treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center
was available. Of the 14 patients, 6 who achieved CR during the study remained in remission 55 to 83 months after
their last treatment with no additional therapy. Five other
patients had allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) after
completing FPD-R treatment; 4 of those patients
remained in remission. Two patients had autologous
SCT, and both remained in remission.
FPD-R achieved major durable responses in this
study. The overall response rate (89%) and duration of
response were comparable to results reported from phase
1 and studies in which FND was tested in patients with
previously treated indolent lymphoma.24,25
The FPD-R regimen was well-tolerated with primarily uncomplicated hematologic toxicities and no serious cardiotoxicity. Given the significant number of
durable responses achieved in this study, further study of
the FPD-R regimen in indolent lymphoma is warranted.
