ABSTRACT:
Neutrophil elastase (NE), a serine protease secreted by neutrophils, contributes
to the progression of cancers to enhance tumor invasion and metastasis. It has been
well reported that the regions surrounding the colorectal cancerous tissues usually
are decorated with increased accumulation or aggregation of neutrophils coupled with
a higher deposition/expression of NE. Therefore, we hypothesized that an increased
expressional level of NE in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) may represent as one
of putative biomarkers for CRC. The aim of this study was to evaluate and assure our
hypothesis by measurements of the expressional level of NE in the sera and tissues
from CRC patients. Moreover, we also proposed a potential therapeutic strategy by
blocking enzymatic activity of NE using sivelestat to inhibit the progression of tumor
developments. The infiltrated numbers of neutrophils from specimen tissues of CRC
patients, and the secreted forms of NE in the sera were quantitatively measured and
compared. To evaluate the serum NE as one of putative biomarkers of CRC patients,
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was made to determine the cut-off
value of NE in sera for assurance of CRC diagnosis. To evaluate NE as therapeutic
target for CRC, sivelestat, a NE inhibitor, was used and administrated into the CRC
xenografts. NE expression level coupled with tumor volume were measured and
compared between the control and sivelestat-treated xenografts. We found that
more infiltrated neutrophils and an increased NE expression were detected in the
cancerous tissues compared to the normal tissues. The serum NE concentration in
CRC patients was statistically higher than that in the healthy controls (0.56±0.08
μg/ml vs. 0.22±0.03μg/ml) (p<0.05), indicating that serum NE can potentially be
a putative marker of CRC. To characterize the role of NE in tumorigenesis, the NE
avtivity was detected in HCT-15-xenografts using in vivo imaging system (IVIS).
Compare to normal mice, the amounts of active NE in xenografts are significantly
higher than normal control animals. In the therapeutic characterizing studies, we

study suggests that NE is not only as a putative diagnostic biomarker of CRC, but also a
potential therapeutic target for patients suffered with CRC.

INTRODUCTION

of subsets from macrophages or neutrophils to TANs
or TAMs may be useful as the surrogate biomarkers of
tumors.
It has been suggested that neutrophil elastase is a
rational candidate of biomarkers because of increasing
expression level of NE during tumorigenesis and its
unique bio-effects in promoting tumor proliferation and
metastasis [3, 20] [21]. As a matter of fact, neutrophil
elastase is a kind of protease which can enzymatically
degrade the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) resulting
in failure to form the association complex of IRS-1and
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to free PI3K
in cytoplasm. The free form of PI3K can associate with
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and
then induce the tumor proliferative signaling pathway
[22]. In summary, NE can act indirectly mediate
PI3K-associated downstream signals for tumor cell
proliferations. Therefore, this unique characteristic of NE
released from neutrophils or TAN is not only as a putative
tumor biomarker but also as an important accelerator in
tumor progression. In this study, we aimed to measure
the expression of NE in serum, and to evaluate NE as a
CRC marker for assisting early diagnosis and use a NE
inhibitor sivelestat as an alternative therapeutic agent to
treat colorectal cancers.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common
gastrointestinal cancers with increasing incidence
worldwide [1]. Due to the difference in the stage at
diagnosis, five-year survival rate of CRC patients varied
from 90% to less than 5%. In clinical practice, most
patients with CRC were diagnosed in the advanced stage
with tumor metastasis resulted in difficulties of treatments,
leading to the poor prognosis. Therefore, to uncover
reliable early biomarkers from CRC patients is urgent and
important. Combined with early detection and treatments,
it can prolong the survival rate and improve prognosis of
patients with CRC.
The endoscopical and histological verification
are considered the gold standard clinical procedure
for diagnosis of CRC [2-4]. However, several factors
including poor resolution of endoscopy plus sampling
error in early small nodules of CRC and inter-personal
variations may contribute to fail in correct detections of
tumors. Several non-invasive biomarkers for assisting the
early detections and diagnosis in gastrointestinal cancers
have been reported and used, such as carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) [5-7]. CRC patients usually express
significantly high level of CEA , which may present as a
putative diagnostic marker. Moreover, CEA level is also
negatively correlated with prognosis. Patients with higher
CEA are prone to suffer the recurrence or metastasis of
CRC [8-11]. Although increased amounts of CEA is one of
markers for early detecting CRC, the diagnostic accuracy
(only ~50%) using CEA as a maker remain controversial
inconclusive because of poor specificity [12]. Therefore,
to uncover other CRC-specific serum biomarkers, and/
or use a multi-marker cocktail strategy may improve the
diagnostic accuracy for CRC [12].
In our previous studies, we found increased
numbers of the infiltrated human neutrophils onto the
gastric cancerous tissues, suggesting that neutrophils may
be positively associated with tumor severity [13]. It has
been suggested that initial tumorigenesis is associated
with tissue inflammation [14]. In detail, activation and
infiltrations of leukocytes including the macrophages
and neutrophils causes the entire array of metabolic and
physiologic changes during sustained inflammations,
leading to tumorigenesis [15]. With unknown reasons,
recruited macrophages and neutrophils can somehow
shifted to specific subsets of leukocytes such as tumorassociated macrophages (TAM) and tumor-associated
neutrophils (TAN), respectively, which initiate or promote
tumor formation and progression [16-19]. Therefore,
these related altering proteins in responded to the changes

RESULTS
Tissue-infiltrated neutrophils accumulated in
colorectal cancer
Tumorigenesis are always accompanied with
constant inflammation in which numerous immune
cells such as neutrophils recruit to tumor foci to secret
various forms of cytokines and neutrophil elastase (NE),
contributing to enhance the tumor progression [23, 24].
We have demonstrated that the increased numbers of
infiltrated neutrophils in the tissues of gastric cancers were
observed in our previous study [13]. To evaluate the role
of neutrophil infiltrations and NE in the tumorigenesis/
progression of colorectal cancer, we first quantified
the numbers of infiltrated neutrophils onto CRC and
then measured the NE expression level. The numbers
of infiltrated neutrophil and the expressional level and
activity of NE derived either from regions of cancerous
tissue (T) or the paired non-tumor region (NT) were
measured and compared. To differentiate cancerous tissue
(T) and the paired non-tumor region (NT), the CRC
specimens were stained with methylene blue (Figure

Neutrophil elastase expressed in sera of CRC
patients as a diagnostic marker

1A). To measure the numbers of the infiltrated neutrophil
onto CRC tumor region, the naphthol AS-D (3-Hydroxy2-naphthoic-o-toluidide) chloroacetate, a substrate
specific for neutrophil esterase, was used. The results
indicated that the numbers of the infiltrated neutrophils
were significantly increased in the CRC tumor tissues as
compared to non-tumor region shown in Figure 1A. This
result was consistent to our previous studies on the gastric
cancers. Furthermore, we also observed the tumor tissues
from CRC xenografts with increased infiltrated neutrophil
numbers as seen in clinical specimens (data not shown).
We further evaluated and compared the expression
level of NE between non-tumor (NT) and CRC tumor
regions (T) using western blotting. The results indicated
that higher expression level of NE in tumors compared
to that in non-tumor regions as shown in Figure 1B,
demonstrating that NE expression was significantly
increased in CRC tumor tissues and may present as a
candidate of CRC biomarkers.

Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a protease which can
cause damage and then generate favorable environments
for carcinogens tumor progression. Furthermore, NE can
enzymatically degrade insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)
and then increase the interactions of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) and the potent mitogen platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGF), triggering to tumor cell
proliferation [22]. Therefore, tumor-deposited NE secreted
from neutrophils may be useful as a candidate biomarker
for benign and malignant diseases [25, 26]. To evaluate the
role of NE in CRC diagnosis, we measured and compared
the amounts of NE from three different sources of serum
including healthy volunteer, individuals with colon
polyp (CP), and patients suffered with CRC. The results
indicated that the NE concentration was significantly
higher in the CRC specimens than that in healthy controls

Figure 1: Neutrophils highly accumulated in the tissues of colorectal cancer (CRC). (A) Histopathological confirmation of

cancerous tumor (T) and non-tumor (NT) tissues of CRC specimen was figured out using methylene blue staining. Neutrophils were then
detected using naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase staining. The results indicated that neutrohpils accumulated in the resected tumor
(T) tissues of CRC higher than that in adjacent non-tumor (NT) tissues from the same individuals. (B) Western blotting was performed to
detect the expression of neutrophil elastase (NE) in T and NT. We found that NE overexpressed in T compared to that in NT (p<0.05, n=3),
indicating that NE secreted by highly accumulated neutrophils can be a tumor biomarker. Scale bar, 200 μm in methylene blue staining and
100μm in neutrophil staining.

Figure 2: Elevated NE level in the sera of colorectal cancer patients. (A) The sera from three groups including healthy volunteers

(n=14), colorectal polyp (CP, n=10), and colorectal cancer (CRC, n=27) were enrolled and compared. NE was measured as 0.22±0.035μg/
ml in healthy volunteers, 0.57±0.15μg/ml in CP, and 0.56±0.078μg/ml in CRC (p<0.05 compared to healthy group). The result indicated
that NE was a reliable marker for predicting CRC. (B) The ROC data suggests that the sensitivity and specificity of NE were 0.63 and 0.643,
respectively, with 0.31μg/ml of cut-off value.

and tumors. In figure 3A, we demonstrated that NE
enzymatic activity is strongly associated with tumors.
This experiment was performed by intravenously injection
of the Neutrophil Elastase 680 FAST imaging agent into
HCT-15-induced xenografts, and then we measured the
fluorescent intensity in three different time point at 4, 8
and 24 hours. The real time imaging results demonstrated
that tumor regions displayed the most strongest fluorescent
intensity, indicating around tumor foci with the maximal
NE enzymatic activity (Fig 3B, p<0.05). Furthermore,
to detail and measure the amounts of NE in various
organs and tissues, the biophysical -distribution assay
was performed. Beside stomach and colon with high
NE activities, the limited NE enzymatic activities were

(Figure 2A, 0.56±0.08 μg/mL vs. 0.22±0.03 μg/mL,
p<0.05), indicating that NE could be a serological marker
of CRC. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of NE
were 0.63 and 0.643, respectively, with a cut-off value of
0.31μg/mL according to ROC analysis (Figure 2B).

The higher activity of neutrophil elastase (NE)
in CRC tumor could be inhibited by sivelestat,
indicating NE as a useful target of CRC
The NE level in serum from CRC patients was
statistically elevated as indicated in Figure 2. Therefore,
we would like to clarify the correlations between NE

Figure 3: The neutrophil elastase (NE) activity was measured in CRC xenografts using an in vivo imaging agent based
on a peptide (amino sequence, PMAVVQSVP) which was specifically recognized by NE. (A & B) NE activity was gradually
elevated from 4h to 24h in tumors (T) compared to muscle (M) after the agent administration via tail vein injection, indicating that NE can
be a reliable theranostic target for CRC. (C) Biodistribution assay of NE expression in the each organ between normal nude mice, without
HCT-15 implatation, and CRC xenografts showed that NE activity was highest in tumors compared to other organs in CRC xenografts, and
HCT-15 implantation caused higher NE expression compared to normal mice in all organs. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

Figure 4: NE was a CRC therapeutic target. (A & B) The neutrophil eleatase inhibitor, sivelestat, was performed to suppress NE

activity. The inhibitory effect of NE activity was measured using real-time in vivo imaging system (IVIS), which indicated that sivelestat
can reduce the NE activity in tumor. (C) Sivelestat can furthermore reduce the tumor growth in vivo (*p<0.05), demonstrating that NE was
a CRC therapeutic target. **p<0.01.

detected in the most organs including liver, spleen, lung,
heart and bone from mice without implantation of HTC-15
tumors (Fig 3C). In the xenografts, however, the strongest
enzymatic activity was noted in the tumor region.
Again, we demonstrated that xenografts displayed with
significantly elevated NE activities in tumors, indicating
that NE can be a putative candidate of CRC makers.
We revealed the associations of NE and tumors.
Furthermore, previous studies suggested that NE can
induce tumor cells proliferation [22]. Taking together,
we hypothesized that tumor growth and progression may
be inhibited or limited by reduced NE activity using NEspecific inhibitors. To examine our hypothesis, sivelestat,
a NE specific inhibitor, was used. We first performed in
vitro cytotoxicity analysis by culturing HTC-15 cells in
the medium containing sivelestat at concentrations of
1, 10, 50 or 100 μg/ml. The results showed sivelestat at
concentration greater than 50 μg/ml directly inhibited
HTC-15 cell proliferation (data not shown). Followed by
in vitro cytotoxicity assay of sivelestat, we evaluated the
inhibitory effects on enzymatic activity by intravenously
injection of 300 μg sivelestat combined with NE imaging
agent to each CRC xenograft. The results shown in Figure
4A and 4B demonstrated that sivelestat can significantly
inhibit in vivo NE activity, especially in the adjacent
regions of tumors. To investigate the therapeutic efficacy
of sivelestat, 100μg of sivelestat was injected to each
CRC xenografts every other day for 3 times. The results
demonstrated that the tumor volume in the xenografts with
injection of sivelestat was statistically diminished near to
two fold reduction (Figure 4C, p<0.05), compared to that
in animals with only PBS injection at day 16 after tumor
transplantation, indicating that targeting to NE activity
may be a potential or alternative therapeutic approach to
eradicate or limit CRC tumor growth and progression.

NE may be a therapeutic target for CRC.
Previous studies have demonstrated that neutrophils
participate in the development and metastasis of tumor
[15, 22, 27-29], thus suppression of neutrophils is also a
proposed strategy for tumor therapy. Overproduction of
NE in tumor tissue elucidates character of neutrophils
on promoting tumor growth. Literatures also report that
NE secreted from neutrophils is a prognostic marker [25,
26], and can trigger tumor proliferation via degrading
IRS-1 in tumor cells [22]. Therefore, NE may be a
target for anti-tumor growth. In this study, we validated
the overexpression of NE in tumor tissues and sera of
CRC, demonstrating that NE was a reliable biomarker of
diagnosing CRC.
Under normal physiological condition, the activity
of secreted NE from neutrophils is regulated by protease
inhibitor such as alpha-1 anti-trypsin (A1AT). However,
in tumor circumstance, A1AT is down-regulated in tumor
tissues [30]. The imbalance between NE and anti-protease
also enhances the NE-induced tumor development.
Except degradation of IRS-1, NE also cleaves pro-TGF-α
to release mature TGF-α in gastric TMK-1 cells, which
activates EGFR-induced tumor proliferation [31, 32].
Based on these evidences, blockage of NE activity is a
good rational therapeutic target. The anti-NE agents, such
as sivelestat, can be a possible candidate or adjuvant for
fighting tumors.
Basically, NE secreted by neutrophils was proposed
to enter blood as a serum biomarker. Therefore, the
serum NE levels were measured (Fig 2A). In the enrolled
CRC patients and healthy volunteers, the sensitivity
and specificity of NE were measured as 0.63 and 0.643,
respectively, with cut-off value 0.31μg/ml. We also
measured the CEA levels, in the enrolled individuals.
The results indicated that the sensitivity and specificity
of CEA applied in clinical practice are 0.593 and 0.643,
respectively, with the cut-off value of 2 ng/ml (data not
shown). Compared to CEA, NE had a similar diagnostic
accuracy. Besides, there was no correlation between NE
and CEA, therefore, we suggest that combination of NE
with CEA may benefit the diagnostic accuracy for CRC.
Except the identification of NE as a reliable
biomarker of CRC, we also demonstrated the highly
accumulation of neutrophils in tumor foci. This character
of neutrophils may also be a target for detecting tumors.
For example, a neutrophil targeting SPECT imaging agent
cFLFLF-PEG-TKPPR-Tc-99m is used to detect activated
neutrophils in the site of inflammation [33], which may
also predict prognosis of tumor and help evaluating
therapeutic effect. But while using NE as a marker to
predict CRC, other diseases involved in neutrophils
activation such as acute lung injury should be excluded.
In conclusion, NE was overexpressed in the sera and
tissues of CRC patients as a diagnostic and a therapeutic
biomarker. In this study, NE levels were measured in
14 healthy volunteers and 27 CRC patients. The results

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated and demonstrated NE in
serum as a putative biomarker for the diagnosis of CRC,
and blocking NE activity using sivelestat or other NE
inhibitors/blockers may provide a new line of therapeutic
drugs to limit CRC progression. Beside increased NE
level in the serum of CRC patients, we also found tumor
tissues with a higher NE expression in compared with that
in the paired non-tumor regions in enrolled individuals.
Moreover, NE level was higher in sera of CRC patients
compared to healthy volunteers. The results indicated that
NE was a reliable and useful diagnostic biomarker of CRC.
On the other hand, a NE inhibitor, sivelestat, was used
to impair NE enzymatic protease activity and evaluate
its therapeutic effects by measuring and comparing the
tumor volume between HCT-15 xenografts with or without
administrations of sivelestat. The results revealed that
sivelestat significantly reduced tumor growth, suggesting
that sivelestat was a good CRC therapeutic candidate and

revealed that the cut-off value of NE was 0.31μg/ml for
distinguishing CRC from health. Thus, NE could be used
as a diagnostic biomarker for CRC in clinical practice.
Regarding NE as a therapeutic target of CRC, NE inhibitor
such as sivelestat could be a candidate applied for the
treatment of CRC in the future.

The pairs of tissue samples were homogenized (Pro
200, Bertec, USA) in the lysis buffer (10 mM of sodium
phosphate, 0.9 % of sodium chloride, 1% of triton-X100,
pH7.4). After getting rid of the precipitated pellets by
centrifugation (10000 rpm, 5 minutes), the peppetted
supernatants were added with the sample buffer (10 mM
of sodium phosphate, 0.9 % of sodium chloride, 8 M of
urea, 30 % of glycerol, 2 % of sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1
% of β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% of bromophenol blue)
by 1: 1 ratio, and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min for protein
denature. Approximately 20 μg of each sample protein
was loaded onto the individual grid of 4-12 % sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE, Invitrogen, USA). The iblot dry blotting system
(Invitrogen, USA) was used to transform the proteins to
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane based on ion
flowing along with a copper electrode. After using 0.5
% of milk to blot the PVDF membrane for 30 min, the
individual 2 μg/ml of primary antibody was added for
incubation for 2 hour on shaking. The consistent secondary
antibodies conjugated with 2 μg/ml of horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) were incubated for 1 hour on shaking
at room temperature. Between the incubating processes,
three-times washing by PBS buffer (10 mM of sodium
phosphate, pH7.4 and 0.9% of sodium chloride) were
necessary. The ECL detection system (Merck Millipore,
USA) was performed, and the images were acquired by
Imaging System (Gel Doc XR System, Bio-Rad, USA)
depending on the moderate exploring time.

METHODS
Acquisition of the tissues of colorectal cancer
The study of acquisition of the clinical samples was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Cheng Hsin
General Hospital (CHGH-IRB-(240) 100-01). The pairs
of tissues including tumors (T) and adjacent non-tumors
(NT) from the individuals of CRC were captured followed
by surgery. The stages of the tumor were determined by
a pathologist using histological staining examination
according to the rules of American Joint Commission
on Cancer Staging (AJCCS) system. The sera were also
collected from patients with CRC or healthy volunteers.

Neutrophils detection and neutrophil elastase
imaging
The pairs of 10 μm-thick tissues from CRC patients
cut by a cryostat (HM525, Thermo Scientific Microm,
Germany) at -20 °C were attached on the general glass
slides for methylene blue staining and for naphthol AS-D
(3-Hydroxy-2-naphthoic-o-toluidide)
chloroacetate
esterase staining. In methylene blue staining, the slides
were fixed using 37% of formadehyde for 15 mins. The
fixed tissues were then immersed in 0.1% of methylene
blue for 1 min after PBS buffer (10 mM sodium
phosphate, pH7.4 and 0.9% sodium chloride) washing,
and consequently washed using tap water. For neutrophils
staining, naphthol AS-D (3-Hydroxy-2-naphthoic-otoluidide) chloroacetate esterase staining method (Sigma,
USA) was performed.
Moreover, the Neutrophil Elastase 680 FAST
imaging agent (PerkinElmer, USA) was performed to
detect NE in vivo. The NE imaging agent is an activated
agent that is optically silenced, but can produce fluorescent
signal after cleavage by neutrophil elastase [34]. The halflife of Neutrophil Elastase 680 FAST imaging agent in
plasma is 4 hours. After 4 hours of intravenous injection
of the dose of 4 nmols (100 μL) into CRC xenografts via
tail vein, in vivo imaging system (IVIS, PerkinElmer,
USA) was performed to capture the imaging for detecting
NE activity. The fluorescent intensity of NE in tumor was
compared to that in muscle according to the student t test.

Tumor inhibition assay
Tumor xenografts were established by injecting 2
× 106 HCT-15 cells into the subcutaneous legs of nude
mice aged 6-8 weeks. The tumor imaging and therapeutic
experiments were performed after 2 weeks from tumor
cells injection. First, the inhibitory effect of sivelestat
to NE activity was investigated using real-time IVIS
technique. The Neutrophil Elastase 680 FAST imaging
agent (PerkinElmer, USA) was co-injected with 300
μg of sivelestat. In addition, 100 μg of sivelestat was
injected via tail vein for 3 times in tumor therapeutic
assay, whereas PBS buffer was used as control. The tumor
volume was calculated as the following formula: length ×
width2 × 0.52.

Statistic analysis
The statistic software GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad
Software, Inc. USA) was performed to calculate the
differential significance using Bonferroni’s Multiple
Comparison Test. The ROC curve was completed using
