ABSTRACT
A proinflammatory cytokine IL-32 acts as an intracellular mediator. IL-32α
interacts with many intracellular molecules, but there are no reports of interaction
with a transcriptional repressor BCL6. In this study, we showed that PMA induces
an interaction between IL-32α, PKCε, and BCL6, forming a trimer. To identify the
mechanism of the interaction, we treated cells with various inhibitors. In HEK293 and
THP-1 cell lines, treatment with a pan-PKC inhibitor, PKCε inhibitor, and PKCδ inhibitor
decreased BCL6 and IL-32α protein expression. MAPK inhibitors and classical PKC
inhibitor did not decrease PMA-induced BCL6 and IL-32α protein expression. Further,
the pan-PKC inhibitor and PKCε inhibitor disrupted PMA-induced interaction between
IL-32α and BCL6. These data demonstrate that the intracellular interaction between
IL-32α and BCL6 is induced by PMA-activated PKCε. PMA induces post-translational
modification of BCL6 by conjugation to SUMO-2, while IL-32α inhibits. PKCε inhibition
eliminated PMA-induced SUMOylation of BCL6. Inhibition of BCL6 SUMOylation by
IL-32α affected the cellular function and activity of the transcriptional repressor
BCL6 in THP-1 cells. Thus, we showed that IL-32α is a negative regulator of the
transcriptional repressor BCL6. IL-32α inhibits BCL6 SUMOylation by activating PKCε,
resulting in the modulation of BCL6 target genes and cellular functions of BCL6.

were first identified in 2005 [1]. IL-32 has since been
associated with cancer, viral infection, and inflammatory
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing
spondylitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [6-11].
IL-32 has several isoforms including α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η,
and θ which was recently discovered by our group [12].
IL-32 is induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) in various cells including immune cells, such
as monocytes/macrophages, and endothelial cells
[13-15]. Although it was first reported as a cytokine, recent

INTRODUCTION
Interleukin (IL)-32 was first identified as a
proinflammatory cytokine in activated T and Natural
killer (NK) cells, and was originally named NK4 [1].
Many reports have revealed that IL-32α is expressed in
various inflammatory cells including peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, NK cells, and
T cells, as well as in non-immune cells such as fibroblasts,
keratinocytes, and endothelial cells in response to various
stimuli [2-5]. The proinflammatory properties of IL-32

reports have established a role for IL-32α in intracellular
pathways [13,  16,  17]. Recent studies have focused on
the  interactions between IL-32 isoforms [12, 18] and
other proteins and transcriptional regulators [13, 16]. We
recently reported that IL-32α binds to STAT3 and PKCε
to induce IL-6 production [13]. IL-32β binds to C/EBPα
and PKCδ to induce IL-10 production [16]. IL-32 isoforms
also interact with each other [12]; in particular, IL-32δ
interacts with IL-32β to inhibit IL-32β from inducing
IL-10 production [18].
Epigenetic mechanisms play crucial roles in several
cellular functions, including DNA damage and repair,
RNA transcription and processing, and protein stability
control and degradation to fundamental cellular process
[19, 20]. Epigenetic post-translational modifications
such as phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination,
and SUMOylation (covalent modification with a small
ubiquitin-like modifier [SUMO] protein) regulate cellular
gene expression [21]. Ubiquitins and SUMOs, ubiquitinlike proteins (Ubls), play an important role in epigenetic
control of gene expression. Both proteins attach covalently
to other proteins on lysine residues by an isopeptide bond
[22, 23]. SUMOylation sometimes requires the consensus
sequence ΨKxE/D (where Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue
and x is any amino acid) around the target lysine, although
this consensus motif is also present in non-SUMOylated
proteins [24]. SUMO also binds other proteins containing
the consensus SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) [25, 26].
There are 4 SUMO isoforms, namely, SUMO-1, -2, -3,
and -4 [27-29]. SUMO-1 is the primary SUMO protein
in human cells and is involved in regulating protein
stability along with ubiquitin [20, 22, 23, 30]. SUMO-2
and SUMO-3 have similar functions in regulating cellular
processes such as signal transduction [28, 31].
B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6 (BCL6), which is encoded
by the ZBTB27 gene, formerly known as LAZ3, is similar
to the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein
[32]. BCL6 is a POK/ZBTB protein. POK/ZBTB family
proteins have an N-terminal, conserved BTB/POZ domain
that interacts with other proteins, and Krüppel type (C2H2)
zinc-finger (ZnF) motifs in the C-terminus that interact
with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. These motifs
are required to repress the transcription of target genes.
POK/ZBTB proteins regulate diverse biological processes,
including development of specific lineages in the immune
system, lymphoid development, and oncogenesis [3335]. In some diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL),
BCL6 protein expression was positively correlated
with the mRNA level of Yin Yang  1 (YY1). YY1
expression was associated with B-cell transformation
and tumor progression in both Burkitt’s lymphoma and
DLBCL [36]. This study highlights the role of IL-32α
in regulating activity of the transcriptional repressor of
BCL6. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-32α inhibits
the transcriptional repressor function of BCL6, which
targets genes such as c-myc, cyclin D2, CCL-3 [35, 37],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and IL-6 [38], by interacting with BCL6 and inducing its
SUMOylation.

RESULTS
PMA stimulates an interaction between IL-32α,
BCL6 and PKCε
We recently observed the interaction between IL-32α
and PLZF by using a yeast two-hybrid system (unpublished
data). Because BCL6 is a member of the human BTB/POZzinc finger family-like PLZF and has a similar structure,
we examined whether IL-32α also interacts with BCL6
[34, 39]. 6×Myc-tagged IL-32α and 5×FLAG-tagged
BCL6 were cotransfected into HEK293 cells, followed
by immunoprecipitation. Upon PMA stimulation, IL-32α
interacts with BCL6. This interaction was diminished by
treatment with the pan-PKC inhibitor Gö6850 (Fig.  1A
and 1B). The interaction between IL-32α and BCL6
was further examined by immunoprecipitation in THP-1
EV and THP-1-IL-32α cells. The interaction between
IL-32α and BCL6 was observed in THP-1-IL-32α cells
stimulated with PMA, but not in the presence of Gö6850
(Fig. 1C). To investigate whether PKCε mediates the
interaction between IL-32α and BCL6, we performed an
immunoprecipitation assay after transfection with siPKCε.
PKCε was almost completely knocked down by PKCεspecific siRNA relative to nontargeting siRNA. Following
PKCε knockdown, the interaction between IL-32α and
BCL6 was not observed after PMA treatment (Fig. 1D).
These data suggest that IL-32α interacts with BCL6 when
PKCε is activated by PMA.
We previously reported that IL-32α specifically
interacts with PKCε and PKCδ [13]. Next, we explored
whether BCL6 might also interact with PKCδ and PKCε.
HEK293 cells were transfected with 5×FLAG-tagged
BCL6, and immunoprecipitation was performed using
normal IgG antibody (IgG) or anti-PKCε antibody.
Endogenous PKCε interacted with BCL6 with PMA
stimulation (Fig. 2A), while PKCδ did not (data not
shown). We then examined whether IL-32α associated
with BCL6 and PKCε together. To establish that IL-32α,
BCL6, and PKCε interact simultaneously after PMA
stimulation, we cotransfected cells with IL-32α, BCL6,
and PKCε and performed immunoprecipitation. After
immunoprecipitation with an anti-PKCε antibody, we
detected the expression of both IL-32α and BCL6. These
interactions were inhibited by treatment with Gö6850
(6850) (Fig. 2B). These interactions were also observed
with endogenous PKCε (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these
results suggest that PMA-stimulated PKCε enhances
the interaction between IL-32α and BCL6 by forming
a trimeric complex. Previous reports have shown
that the IL-32α signaling pathway is mediated by the
NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling pathways [1]. Next
we investigated whether MAPK and various PKC

signaling pathways meditate the interaction between
IL-32α and BCL6. HEK293 cells were transfected with 6×
Myc-tagged IL-32α and 5×FLAG-tagged BCL6 and
pretreated with various signaling pathway inhibitors
before PMA activation. Treatment with inhibitors
PD98059, SB203580, and SP600125 for ERK, p38,
and JNK, respectively slightly decreased the interaction
compared to PMA only controls (Fig. 3). Gö6850, a panPKC inhibitor, and Ro-31-8220, a PKCε-specific inhibitor,
strongly inhibited the interaction between IL-32α and
BCL6. Gö6976, a PKCα and β inhibitor, and Rottlerin,
a PKCδ inhibitor, did not disrupt the interaction, although
Rottlerin did decrease BCL6 and IL-32α expression
(Fig.  3). These data imply that the interaction between
IL-32α and BCL6 is specifically mediated by PMAactivated PKCε.

the interaction between BCL6 and IL-32α regulates
BCL6 ubiquitination. We cotransfected HEK293 cells
with BCL6 and ubiquitin along with IL-32α or empty
vector and treated the cells with PMA for various times.
Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiflag antibody to pull down BCL6. As shown in Figs. 4A,
and 4C, IL-32α had no effect on BCL6 protein expression.
However, PMA treatment did induce BCL6 ubiquitination
in IL-32α expressing cells, compared to empty vector
cells (Fig. 4A). BCL6 ubiquitination was suppressed
by Gö6850 (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that IL-32α
induces ubiquitination of BCL6 with PMA activation of
PKC. SUMO-1 enhances PLZF stability by competitively
binding at ubiquitin-binding sites [30]. The ZBTB1 protein
contains an amino-terminal BTB domain and eight zinc
fingers and is conjugated by SUMO-2 [45]. We observed
that IL-32α induces SUMO-2 conjugation to PLZF in
response to PMA stimulation (unpublished data). BCL6
ubiquitination is known to lead to protein degradation.
IL-32α, however, does not alter BCL6 protein expression
(Figs. 1C, 4A, and 4C). Therefore, we investigated
the possible interaction between SUMO-2 and BCL6.
PMA treatment for 8 h induced SUMO-2 modification
of BCL6, whereas SUMOylation was inhibited in
IL-32α-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). Because Gö6850
inhibited SUMO-2 modification, SUMOylation of BCL6
is PKC dependent in nature (Fig. 4D). These results imply
that IL-32α, mediated by PKC, inhibits BCL6 interaction
with SUMO-2. The specificity of BCL6 modification
by SUMO-2 was further verified with quantitative
SUMOylation assays in THP-1 cells. THP-1 EV and
THP-1-IL-32α cells were cotransfected with SUMO-2
and BCL6 and treated with PMA for 8 h. SUMO-2
interaction with BCL6 was detected by an ELISA assay.
IL-32α significantly inhibited SUMO-2 conjugation

IL-32α inhibits BCL6 SUMOylation conjugated
by SUMO-2, and induces BCL6 ubiquitination
upon PMA stimulation
Next, we investigated whether IL-32α mediates posttranslational modifications of BCL6. Many studies indicate
that the PLZF protein undergoes epigenetic regulation by
SUMO-1 and ubiquitin conjugation. These modifications
are functionally complementary [30]. Ubiquitination
inhibits the transcriptional regulator PLZF through
degradation and decreased protein stability [40], whereas
SUMOylation upregulates PLZF by enhancing protein
stability [41, 42]. BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor in
the POK (POZ and Krüppel)/ZBTB (zinc finger and BTB)
protein family, along with PLZF. BCL6 is structurally
and functionally similar to PLZF [34]. Ubiquitination
of BCL6 has been reported to affect its transcriptional
repressor activity [35, 43, 44]. We investigated whether

50 nM PMA for an additional 3 h. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 μg of anti-myc tag antibody. Anti-flag antibody was used to detect

IL-32α drives IL-6 production and inhibits the
transcriptional repressor BCL6, upregulating
BCL6 target gene expression

to BCL6. This result (Fig. 4E) confirmed the results of the
immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 4B). To further assess the
effects of PKCε on SUMOylation of BCL6, we performed
immunoprecipitation and quantitative SUMOylation assays
using RNAi to specifically downregulate PKCε. When
siPKCε was transfected into THP-1 EV and THP-1-IL-32α
cells, the percentage of SUMOylated BCL6 was decreased
in THP-1 EV cell lines (Figs. 4F and G). Thus, these data
indicate that IL-32α regulates SUMO-2 modification of
BCL6 via PKCε signaling. Figs. 3 and 4 show that PKCε
can mediate both BCL6 ubiquitination and SUMOylation.
These post-translational modifications are regulated by
IL-32α in a functionally complementary manner.

To assess the effects of IL-32α-mediated posttranslational modification of BCL6, we evaluated the
expression of BCL6 target genes. THP-1 cell lines stably
expressing either IL-32α or empty vector were transfected
with BCL6 and then incubated with PMA for 0, 12,
or 48 h. qRT-PCR was performed to assess the expression
of well-known BCL6 target genes, namely, c-Myc, cyclin
D2, and CCL3 [37, 46-48]. THP-1 cells expressing IL-32α
had increased c-Myc expression compared to the empty

encoding Myc-tagged ubiquitin (2 μg) and FLAG-tagged BCL6 (1 μg) were cotransfected into HEK293 cells with or without the IL-32α
expression vector (0.5 μg). After overnight incubation, transfected cells were incubated with PMA (50 nM) for the given time before
harvest. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting carried out as described. Ubiquitin-modified BCL6 is
indicated by trailing bands. (B) HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged SUMO-2 (2 μg) and FLAG-tagged

as described in (A). (C and D), The experiments described in (A) and (B) were repeated, now using the pan-PKC inhibitor, Gö6850.
Transfected cells were preincubated with pan PKC inhibitor, Gö6850 (6850; 10 μM) for 2 h followed by 50 nM PMA for 8 h.

12 h, decreased by 48 h, more stable than in THP-1 EV
cells, where the expression levels decreased considerably
between 12 h and 48 h (Fig. 5A). Cyclin D2 and CCL3
expression increased significantly in the presence of BCL6
at 48 h in THP-1-IL-32α cells compared to THP-1 EV
cells (Figs. 5B and 5C). Increased c-Myc, cyclin D2, and
CCL3 gene expression may result from decreased BCL6
activity in response to PMA-activated IL-32α.
We previously reported that IL-32α induces STAT3
phosphorylation and IL-6 production in THP-1 human

Macrophages from BCL6 -/- mice produce significantly
more IL-6 than wild-type macrophages [38]. To evaluate
the production of IL-6 with BCL6 inhibition by IL-32α,
we transfected THP-1-IL-32α and THP-1 EV cells with
BCL6 and treated them with PMA. ELISA revealed that
PMA significantly increased IL-6 production in both
cell lines, but with greater magnitude in the presence of

IL-6 production was suppressed by BCL6. These results
strongly suggest that PMA activates endogenous IL-32α
expression in THP-1-IL-32α cells, which therein recovers
the IL-6 production suppressed by BCL6 (Fig.  6A).
To investigate this further, we examined how IL-32α
suppressing BCL6 might affect the activity of the IL-6
promoter in HEK293 cells cotransfected with PKCε and
the IL-6 promoter. IL-6 reporter activity was suppressed
to almost 57% in the presence of BCL6. When IL-32α
was cotransfected along with PKCε and the IL-6 promoter,
the reporter activity fully recovered (Fig. 6B). So far, our

results demonstrate that IL-32α negatively regulates the
effects of BCL6 on BCL6 target gene expression and IL-6
production. We then explored whether PKCε mediates this
inhibitory activity of IL-32α with respect to the cellular
functions of BCL6. THP-1 EV and THP-1-IL-32α cells
were transfected with BCL6. These cells were pretreated
with Gö6850 (6850) or Gö6976 (6976) before PMA
activation. On treatment with Gö6850, IL-6 production
was completely inhibited in both cell lines. Treatment
with the classical PKC inhibitor, Gö6976 also decreased
IL-6 production compared to treatment with PMA alone,

IL-32α-expressing vector (1 μg), as described. After overnight incubation, cells were further incubated with 50 nM PMA for 24 h. The cell
lysate was then subjected to a dual-luciferase assay. Results are presented as percent activity relative to the activity in cells transfected with
neither IL-32α nor BCL6 (set a 100%). Data (mean and SEM.) are representative of at least six independent experiments. (C) THP-1 EV

and morphology were analyzed using phase-contrast microscopy.

but the fold-increase ranges noted for THP-1-IL-32α
cells were similar to those observed after PMA treatment,
compared to THP-1 EV cells (Fig. 6C). The adhesion of
THP-1 cells with PMA was inhibited in the presence of
IL-32α, as previously reported [17]. BCL6 gene expression
is continuously increased in PMA-stimulated THP-1
monocyte-macrophage differentiation [49]. To verify
that PKCε is involved in the adhesion of THP-1 cells,
we treated them with PKC inhibitors. Pan-PKC inhibitor
Gö6850 perfectly inhibited adhesion in both cells lines.
However, cells treated with the classical PKC inhibitor
Gö6976 showed that the inhibitory effect on the adhesion
induced by IL-32α might be attributed to the non-classical
PKCs (Fig. 6D). These results demonstrate that IL-32α
regulates the function of BCL6 via IL-6 production and
cell adhesion through PKCε mediation.

of PLZF are determined by the antagonistic relationship
between these two post-translational modifications [30,
41, 42]. BCL6 functions as a transcriptional repressor
by interacting with various corepressors to regulate the
cell cycle and immune responses [37, 51-54]. BCL6
ubiquitination has already been reported [35, 43]. BCL6
protein is phosphorylated by MAPKs, ERK-1 and
ERK-2, which leads to BCL6 degradation via the
ubiquitin/proteasome pathway [44]. We observed that
PMA treatment resulted in more BCL6 ubiquitination
in the presence of IL-32α than in the absence of IL-32α
(Fig. 4). IL-32α had no effect on BCL6 protein expression
or localization (data not shown), while PMA enhanced
BCL6 expression in the presence or absence of IL-32α.
This result implies that IL-32α mediated ubiquitination
does not affect BCL6 degradation. To further elucidate
the mechanism by which IL-32α regulates BCL6
modification, we next evaluated SUMO-2 modification of
BCL6. We found for the first time that BCL6 was modified
by SUMO-2. PMA-mediated BCL6 SUMOylation was
inhibited by IL-32α. This modification was dependent on
PKCε activation, because Gö6850 and siPKCε inhibited
the BCL6 SUMOylation (Fig. 4). These results indicate
that reduction of SUMO-2-conjugated BCL6 by IL-32α
was mediated by PKCε. Previous reports indicate that
blocking BCL6 induces the expression of cell cyclerelated genes [37, 55]. Assuming that IL-32α is related to
the cell cycle by repressing BCL6, we analyzed several
cell cycle profiles by qRT-PCR. IL-32α induced the
expression of several cell cycle genes (Fig. 5). These data
suggest that IL-32α is involved in inhibiting differentiation
and enhancing proliferation by inhibiting BCL6. This
result is also supported by our previous reports that IL-32α
significantly suppresses differentiation into macrophagelike cells by inhibiting cell adhesion molecules on
THP-1 cells [17]. IL-32 has been studied in inflammatory
responses. Several studies reported that IL-32β and
IL-32γ induce production of the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10 [16, 18, 56, 57], and IL-32α, in particular,
promotes IL-6 production in myeloid cells [13]. IL-6 is a
transcriptional target of BCL6. BCL6 negatively regulates
IL-6 production by specifically binding to consensus sites
on IL-6 [38]. Consistent with previous reports, IL-32α
induced IL-6 production. In addition, BCL6-induced
downregulation of IL-6 was recovered in the presence
of IL-32α. We demonstrate that the mechanism of IL-6
production regulated by the interaction of IL-32α and
BCL6 was mediated PKCε. To clarify a cellular function
of IL-32α, we performed cell adhesion assay (Fig. 6). In
keeping with results of previous reports, our data suggest
that inhibition of cell adhesion by IL-32 was mediated by
PKCε [17]. Before this study, limited information existed
on the role of IL-32α in intracellular signaling. A study
of the interaction between IL-32α and target proteins
suggested that an immune response regulated the effect,
although the specific receptors and a detailed mechanism

DISCUSSION
IL-32 has been described as a proinflammatory
cytokine. Its structure is unique among cytokines, and no
specific cell-surface receptor of IL-32 has been identified.
Many studies have focused on the biological functions
of IL-32 exerted through interactions with intracellular
molecules [13, 16, 18, 50]. Using a yeast two-hybrid
system to screen IL-32α interacting proteins, we identified
PLZF. We predicted that BCL6 also interacts with
IL-32α because BCL6, like PLZF, is also a POK/ZBTB
protein [32, 34]. BCL6 and PLZF have many analogous
properties which include molecular structure and cellular
functions. IL-32α induces IL-6 production by interacting
with PKCε and STAT3 upon PMA treatment [13]. BCL6
represses IL-6 production. Macrophages from BCL6 (-/-)
mice produce more IL-6 than do wild-type macrophages
[38]. Our results show that IL-32α interacted with BCL6
after PMA stimulation. This interaction was diminished
by pretreatment with a pan-PKC inhibitor. Therefore, we
sought to determine if PKCε mediates this interaction by
PMA. THP-1-IL-32α cells were transfected with siPKCε
to lack PKCε, and the results of immunoprecipitation
eliminates the possibility of an interaction between
IL-32α and BCL6 (Fig. 1). We investigated whether BCL6
interacts with PKCδ and PKCε because IL-32α interacts
with both PKCs [13]. We found that BCL6 did not interact
with PKCδ (data not shown). We also demonstrated
that IL-32α, BCL6, and PKCε form a trimeric complex
(Fig. 2). Immunoprecipitation analyses using inhibitors
showed that PKCε is the primary signaling molecule
in the interaction between IL-32α and BCL6. MAPKs,
NF-κB, and other PKCs had only a minor effect (Fig. 3).
These results support that IL-32α acts as a modulator by
interacting with PKCε [13].
PLZF is modified by ubiquitin and SUMO-1, and
these modifications regulate its biological function.
Ubiquitin and SUMO-1 conjugation are competitive.

Korea) according to a previously reported siPKCε
sequence [58]. HEK293 cells were transfected with
pcDNA3.1 + 6×Myc-IL-32α, pcDNA3.1 + 5×FLAGBCL6 and pCS3MT + -SUMO-2 or -ubiquitin by using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and cell culture

Western blot and immunoprecipitation

Human promyelomonocytic THP-1 and human
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
MD). THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (WelGENE,
Daegu, Korea) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine,
100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT). HEK293
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) (Invitrogen, Seoul, Korea) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT).
Phorbol 12-myristate 13- acetate (PMA) was purchased
from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). MAPK inhibitors
(PD98059, SB203580, and SP100625) and PKC inhibitors
(Gö6850, Gö6976, Ro-31-8220, and Rottlerin) were
purchased from Calbiochem (Calbiochem, San Diego,
CA). The IL-32α-expressing THP-1 stable cell lines were
previously established [13].

HEK293, THP-1 EV, and THP-1-IL-32α cells
were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1 + 6×Myc-IL-32α,
­pcDNA3.1 + 5×FLAG-BCL6, and pCS3MT + -SUMO-2
or -ubiquitin and then lysed in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5),
150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate,
1% NP-40, 0.5% TX-100, and 1 mM EDTA. Western blot
was performed with an anti-myc tag antibody (Millipore,
­Bedford, MA), anti-flag tag antibody (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO), anti-PKCδ/ε antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
TX), anti-IL-32 antibody KU32-52 [15, 17], and anti-BCL6
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were mixed with 1 μg of anti-myc tag
antibody, 1 μg of anti-PKC δ/ε antibody, and 2 μg of antiflag tag antibody for 1 h and then precipitated with 35 μl of
protein G-agarose beads (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD).

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and real-time qPCR analyses

Construction of expression vectors

THP-1 EV and THP-1-IL-32α cells were treated
with 10 nM PMA for the indicated time, and total RNA was
extracted for RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using the
Easy-Blue total RNA extraction kit (iNtRon Biotechnology,
Seoul, Korea). For cDNA synthesis, reverse transcription
was performed with 2 μg of the total RNA, oligo dT,
dNTPs, DTT, buffer and Superscript M-MuLV reverse
transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). cDNA
was analyzed by real-time qPCR using iQ SYBR Green
Supermix (both from BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to
the manufacturer's instructions for relative quantification
by using Chromo 4 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Target gene
expressions were normalized to that of the housekeeping
gene, GAPDH. Primers sets were as follows: c-Myc:
sense 5′-TCA AGA GGC GAA CAC ACA AC-3′, antisense
5′-GGC CTT TTC ATT GTT TTC CA-3′; CCND2:
sense 5′-CCG GAC CTA ATC CCT CAC TC-3′, antisense
5′-CAC ACC GAT GCA GCT TTC TA-3′; and CCL3:
sense 5′-GGT CTC CAC TGC TGC CCT TGC-3′, antisense
5′-GGA ATC TGC CGG GAG GTG TAG C-3′.

IL-32α cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1  +
6×Myc vector using EcoRI and XhoI. cDNAs for
PKCδ and PKCε were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 +
5×FLAG vector using EcoRI and XhoI [13]. BCL6,
SUMO-2, and ubiquitin cDNAs were PCR-amplified
from a human spleen cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto,
CA). The primers sets were as follows: BCL6: sense
5′-GAA TTC ATG GCC TCG CCG GCT GAC AGC TG-3′,
antisense 5′-CTC GAG GCA GGC TTT GGG GAG CTC
CGG AG-3′; SUMO-2: sense 5′- GCT GAA TTC ATG
GCC GAC GAA AAG CCC-3′, antisense 5′- GAA CTC
GAG CTA ACC TCC CGT CTG CTG-3′; ubiquitin: sense
5′-GGA TCC ATG CAG ATC TTC GTG AAA ACC-3′,
antisense 5′-CTC GAG CTA ACC ACC TCT CAG ACG
CAG-3′. The entire BCL6 gene was amplified and cloned
into pcDNA3.1 + 5×FLAG vector using EcoRI and XhoI.
SUMO-2 and ubiquitin cDNAs were subcloned into the
pCS3MT + 6×Myc vector using EcoRI and XhoI.

Transfection
THP-1 promonocytic cells were transfected
with pcDNA3.1 + 5×FLAG-BCL6 and pCS3MT +
-SUMO-2 or -ubiquitin using the Neon™ transfection
system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. PKCε siRNA was transfected
in the same way. PKCε siRNA and non-targeting siRNA
