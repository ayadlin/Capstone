Abstract
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in the United States. Although there are
effective drugs for treating advanced stages of breast cancers, women eventually develop resistance. One of the
approaches to control breast cancer is prevention through diet, which inhibits one or more neoplastic events
and reduces cancer risk. In this study, we have used human breast cancer cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and
primary human mammary epithelial cells as an in vitro model to assess the efficacy of bitter melon (Momordica
charantia) extract (BME) as an anticancer agent. BME treatment of breast cancer cells resulted in a significant
decrease in cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis of breast cancer cells was accompanied
by increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase activation. Subsequent studies showed that
BME treatment of breast cancer cells inhibited survivin and claspin expression. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis suggested that MCF-7 cells treated with BME accumulated during the G2-M phase of the cell cycle.
Further studies revealed that BME treatment enhanced p53, p21, and pChk1/2 and inhibited cyclin B1 and cyclin
D1 expression, suggesting an additional mechanism involving cell cycle regulation. Together, these results show
that BME modulates signal transduction pathways for inhibition of breast cancer cell growth and can be used as
a dietary supplement for prevention of breast cancer. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1925–31. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most frequent neoplasm in women
from Western countries. The etiology of breast cancer involves a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and probably dietary factors. There have been significant advances in
breast cancer treatment that have improved patient survival
and quality of life. However, women continue to die of the
disease and new treatment strategies are essential. Cancer
prevention by the use of naturally occurring dietary substances is considered as a practical approach to reduce the
ever increasing incidence of cancer. The intervention of multistage carcinogenesis by modulating intracellular signaling
pathways may provide a molecular basis for chemoprevention with a wide variety of dietary phytochemicals (1). Cancer
cells acquire resistance to apoptosis by overexpression of
antiapoptotic proteins and/or by downregulation or mutation of proapoptotic proteins. Generally, the growth rate of
preneoplastic or neoplastic cells exceeds that of normal cells

due to dysregulation of their cell growth and cell death machineries. Therefore, an excellent approach to inhibit the promotion and progression of carcinogenesis and to remove
genetically deregulated, premalignant and malignant cells
from the body is by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis
using dietary chemopreventive compounds.
Momordica charantia, also known as bitter melon, balsam
pear, or karela, is widely cultivated in Asia, Africa, and South
America and extensively used in folk medicines as a remedy
for diabetes, specifically in India, China, and Central America
(2). Freeze-dried bitter melon capsules are available and marketed in health food stores across North America and Western European countries (Eclectic Institute, Inc.). Animal
studies have used either fresh bitter melon extract (BME)
or crude organic fractions to evaluate its hypoglycemic and
hypolipidemic effects (3–6). Compounds isolated from the
fruit and seeds of bitter melon plant that are believed to
contribute to its hypoglycemic activity include charantin
(a steroid glycoside) and polypeptide “p” or plant insulin (a
166-residue insulin mimetic peptide; refs. 7, 8). Bitter melon
is also known to contain additional glycosides such as mormordin, vitamin C, carotenoids, flavanoids, and polyphenols (9, 10).
BME preparations from independent laboratories have shown
comparable beneficial effects not only on glucose metabolism
but also on plasma and hepatic lipids (11–13). In this study, we
have used the crude BME to examine its efficacy against breast
cancer cells as a model. Our data show that treatment of breast
cancer cells with BME accumulates at the G2-M phase of the
cell cycle and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Figure 1. BME inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation. Breast cancer cells
(MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and HMECs were treated with different
concentrations of BME (1%, 2%, and 5%, v/v). Cell viability was
measured after 48 h by trypan blue exclusion. Columns, mean of three
separate experiments. The lowest level of significance was P < 0.001.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of BME. BME was prepared from the Chinese
variety of young bitter melons (raw and green) as discussed
previously (11). Briefly, BME was extracted using a household
juicer and centrifuged at 560 × g at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant BME was stored in aliquots at −80°C until further
analysis.
Cells. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS. Human primary mammary
epithelial cells (HMEC; obtained from Lonza) were maintained in mammary epithelial basal medium (Lonza).
Human apoptosis antibody array. The expression profile
of apoptosis-related proteins was detected and analyzed using a human apoptosis array kit (ARY009, R&D Systems).
This array contains duplicate spots of 35 apoptosis-related
proteins. Briefly, the membrane containing immobilized apoptosis-related antibodies was blocked with bovine serum albumin for 1 h on a rocking platform at room temperature.
The membrane was then incubated with lysates of MCF-7
or MDA-MB-231 cells treated with or without BME along
with Detection Antibody Cocktail overnight at 2°C to 8°C
on a rocking platform. The membrane was incubated with

streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate followed by
chemiluminescent detection reagent. The membrane was
scanned and pixel density was presented by quantifying the
mean spot densities from two experiments.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. MCF-7 cells
were treated with BME for 6 and 24 h. Cells were trypsinized
and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight at 4°C. Cells were
washed, stained with propidium iodide for overnight, and
subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD PharMingen) as described previously (14). Data were analyzed using the
CellQuest and ModFit softwares.
Western blot analysis. Breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231) were treated with or without BME, and cell
lysates were prepared 48 h after treatment in 2× SDS sample
buffer. Cell lysates were analyzed for Western blot analysis
using poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3, caspase-7, claspin, survivin, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, p21, p53, and
pRb antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Cell Signaling),
followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were reprobed with actin to compare protein
load in each lane.

Results and Discussion
BME treatment induces human breast carcinoma cell
death. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer cells), and
HMECs were treated with different concentrations (1%, 2%,
and 5%, v/v) of BME. Cell viability was measured after
48 hours by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 1). We have observed
>80% cell death in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells treated
with 2% (v/v) BME. On the other hand, primary epithelial
cells did not display a significant cytotoxicity even after 5 d
of incubation with BME.
BME treatment of MCF-7 cells induces PARP cleavage
and caspase activation. Cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme
PARP from a 116-kDa protein to a signature peptide of
86 kDa is associated with a variety of apoptotic responses.
PARP is a nuclear protein and a downstream substrate of
activated caspase-3/7. To examine the effect of BME on the
apoptotic signaling pathway, PARP cleavage was investigated

Figure 2. BME-mediated cell death involves
PARP cleavage and caspase activation.
Lysates were prepared from MCF-7 cells (A)
or MDA-MB-231 cells (B) treated with
BME (2%) for 48 h and subjected to Western
blot analysis using a specific antibody to
PARP or caspases. After treatment of BME,
PARP was cleaved to an 86-kDa signature
peptide (top). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with
BME induces caspase-7 (A). The antibody
used in this experiment only recognized the
procaspase-7 form. On the other hand,
BME treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells induces
caspase-3 (B; cleaved caspase-3). The blot
was reprobed with an antibody to actin
for comparison of equal protein load.

in MCF-7 cells treated with different concentrations of BME by
Western blot analysis using a specific antibody. Cells treated with
BME displayed a cleaved 86-kDa signature peptide as shown in
Fig. 2A. MCF-7 cells treated with BME displayed activation of
caspase-7 (Fig. 2A). BME treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells also
induced PARP cleavage and activated caspase-3 (Fig. 2B).
Breast cancer cells treated with BME inhibits survivin
and claspin expression. To investigate the involvement of
apoptotic signaling molecules following BME treatment, we
performed an apoptosis antibody array using the Human Apoptosis Array from R&D Systems. For this, MCF-7 or MDAMB-231 cells were treated with BME (2%, v/v) for 48 h. Cell
lysates were prepared and apoptosis antibody array was done
following the manufacturer's protocol. Our results showed
that a number of apoptotic signaling proteins were modulated
following treatment of BME. Survivin, XIAP, and claspin were
significantly inhibited following treatment of BME in both

www.aacrjournals.org

MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3A and B, respectively).
On the other hand, the proapoptotic gene catalase was upregulated in both cell lines after BME treatment. Antiapoptotic
proteins Bcl-2 and cIAP-1 were inhibited only in BME-treated
MCF-7 cells, whereas p27, HO-1, and Bax protein expressions
were increased in BME-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. We further
verified the expression of survivin and claspin, proteins involved in inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis,
by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Our results
verified an inhibition of both proteins following BME treatment in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3C).
Modulation of proteins involved in the cell cycle process
following BME treatment. Because both claspin and survivin
are involved in cell cycle regulation (15, 16), we next examined whether BME treatment modulates cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells by FACS analysis. Cells were treated
with BME for 6 and 24 h. Control (untreated) and treated

cells were collected and stained with propidium iodide
followed by FACS analysis. A significant increase in G2-M
peak (19% at 6 hours, 45% at 24 hours) was observed in
BME-treated MCF-7 cells, compared with only a 10% increase
in the control cells (Fig. 4), suggesting an accumulation at the
G2-M phase of the cell cycle. We have also observed a trend of
inhibition of cyclins and enhancement of p21 at the 6-hour
time point (data not shown). Therefore, these results suggest
that BME treatment in MCF-7 cells affects their normal regulation of cell cycle progression.
We also examined key cell cycle regulatory molecules following BME treatment. MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were
exposed to BME (2%, v/v) for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared
and Western blot was done using specific antibodies. We
chose to examine the molecules that are downstream of survivin and/or claspin. BME-treated MCF-7 cell lysates dis-

played inhibition of cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 expression and
upregulation of p53 and p21 (Fig. 5A). We further examined
the status of phospho-Chk1/2 because these molecules are
activated in DNA stress (15). Our results showed an increase
in phospho-Chk1/2 (S345Chk1 and T68Chk2) following BME
treatment (Fig. 5B). Similar results were observed from MDAMB-231 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that
BME uses several signaling pathways that induce breast cancer cell death.
Uncontrolled cell growth and resistance to apoptosis are
major defects in neoplasia. Development of approaches that
induce apoptotic machinery within cancer cells could be effective against their proliferation and invasive potential
(17). A number of agents such as γ-irradiation, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy induce apoptosis in tumor cells
as the primary mode of action for most anticancer therapies.

BME for 6 and 24 h and stained with
propidium iodide. DNA content was

Impairment of this pathway is implicated in treatment resistance (18). In fact, many chemopreventive agents of natural
origin have shown promising anticancer properties by induction of the apoptotic pathway in transformed or tumor cells
(1, 13). In this present study, we have shown that BME exerts
a significant effect on inhibition of cell growth and induction
of apoptosis in breast cancer cells mediated by cell cycle and
apoptosis regulatory proteins. The expression of critical cell
cycle regulatory proteins cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 was significantly decreased and the G2-M phase was blocked in MCF-7
cells following BME treatment. This is the first report, to our
knowledge, describing the mechanism of BME-mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell growth. Future in vivo study will
reveal the anticancer efficacy of crude BME in breast cancer
animal models.
Over the years, there has been a worldwide interest in BME
as a dietary supplement because of its various health beneficial effects including lowering diabetes and lipidemia (6, 12).
A recent study by us reveals that BME is well tolerated, and
has been termed as relatively safe in acute, subchronic, and
chronic doses in animal studies (6). Recently, α-eleostearic
acid and the dihydroxy derivative from bitter melon were
suggested to be the major inducers of apoptosis in HL60 cells
(19). MCP30, isolated from bitter melon seeds, selectively induces prostate cancer apoptosis and inhibits histone deacetylase-1 activity (20). While our article was under review,
Grossmann and colleagues (21) reported that α-eleostearic
acid, which makes up ∼60% of M. charantia seed oil, blocks
MDA-MB-231-ERα cell proliferation and induces apoptosis.
We have examined the effect of BME in both estrogen receptor (ER)–positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells and
observed inhibition of survivin expression. Survivin, a member of the BIR-containing inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)
family, involved in inhibition of apoptosis, exerts multiple effects throughout the cell cycle (reviewed in ref. 16). The importance of survivin in inhibiting cell death and promoting
cell proliferation is emphasized by its overexpression in
many human tumors including breast cancer. BME downregulates survivin expression in breast cancer cells along with
other antiapoptotic molecules. We have observed that BMEmediated inhibition of survivin also reduced cyclin B1 and
cyclin D1 expression. Bcl-2 is an upstream effector molecule

www.aacrjournals.org

in the apoptotic pathway and is identified as a potent suppressor of apoptosis and also is regulated by survivin (22, 23).
We have observed downregulation of Bcl-2 following BME
treatment in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Therefore, it is
conceivable that the downregulation of survivin is mechanistically linked with BME-mediated cell growth inhibition and
apoptosis. Our results also indicated that cyclin B1 was
downregulated in BME-treated breast cancer cells, whereas
the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 was upregulated, suggesting that BME inhibited breast cancer cell
growth through the arrest of cell cycle and inhibition of proliferation. The CDK inhibitors (p21, p27, and p57) have been
shown to arrest the cell cycle and inhibit the growth of cancer cells (24–26). Inhibition of cell growth by BME could be
due to the induction of apoptosis in addition to cell cycle arrest.
Overexpression of survivin is also involved in resistance to chemotherapy (27). Therefore, the downregulation of survivin by
BME could also be a useful strategy for chemosensitization

inhibition and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

of metastatic breast cancer cells. Further in-depth investigations are needed to establish the cause-and-effect relationship
of the survivin gene regulation and BME-mediated cell growth
inhibition and apoptosis in breast cancer in animal models.
Claspin expression is inhibited in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells following BME treatment. In normal cells and tissues,
claspin expression was weak, whereas increased levels were
observed in cancer cell lines and tumor specimens (15). Claspin is required for the phosphorylation and activation of the
Chk1 protein kinase by ATR during DNA replication and in response to DNA damage. Chk1 and Chk2 are key mediators
of intra-S-phase checkpoint signaling. How this pathway
couples to cell survival is controversial, especially with respect to p53, and is associated with activation or inhibition
of apoptosis after stress or DNA damage (27). We have observed an increase of phospho-Chk1 (S345) and phosphoChk2 (T68) expression following BME treatment in MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells. These results are in agreement with
previous studies where curcumin, diallyl trisulfide, resveratrol, and lithium caused activation of Chk1 by phosphorylation
at Ser-345 residue in human pancreatic (28), prostate (29), ovarian (30), and hepatocellular (31, 32) carcinoma cells. Cortez (33)
also reported that phosphorylation of Chk1/2 was increased in a
dose-dependent manner by caffeine treatment along with hydroxyurea, irradiation, or aphidicolin. However, the inhibition
of claspin and activation of Chk1 by BME in breast cancer cells
suggests another function of claspin besides activation of Chk1
and warrants further investigation.

In response to DNA damage, p53 is unregulated and phosphorylates various kinases such ATM, ATR, and DNA-dependent protein kinase. Activated (phosphorylated) ATM also
phosphorylates Chk2. We have observed upregulation of
p53 and phospho-Chk. Further study is needed to examine
the regulation of upstream signaling molecules of Chk and
p53 in BME-treated breast cancer cells.
In summary, we have shown that BME exerts a significant
effect on inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis
in breast cancer cells mediated by cell cycle and apoptosis
regulatory proteins, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Together, these
results suggest that BME modulates several signal transduction pathways that additively or synergistically induce breast
cancer cell death and can be used as a dietary supplement for
prevention of breast cancer.
