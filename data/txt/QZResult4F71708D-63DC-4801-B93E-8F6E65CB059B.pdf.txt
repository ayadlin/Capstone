Abstract
Ovarian cancer is a lethal gynecologic malignancy that may benefit from new therapies that block key paracrine pathways involved in tumor-stromal interactions and tumor vascularity. It was recently shown that matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP1) activation of the G protein–coupled receptor protease-activated receptor-1
(PAR1) is an important stimulator of angiogenesis and metastasis in peritoneal mouse models of ovarian cancer. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that MMP1-PAR1 promotes angiogenesis through its paracrine control of angiogenic chemokine receptors. We found that MMP1-PAR1 activation induces the secretion
of several angiogenic factors from ovarian carcinoma cells, most prominently interleukin (IL)-8, growthregulated oncogene-α (GRO-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. The secreted IL-8 and GRO-α acts
on endothelial CXCR1/2 receptors in a paracrine manner to cause robust endothelial cell proliferation, tube
formation, and migration. A cell-penetrating pepducin, X1/2pal-i3, which targets the conserved third intracellular loop of both CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors, significantly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, angiogenesis, and ovarian tumor growth in mice. Matrigel plugs mixed with MMP1-stimulated,
OVCAR-4–conditioned media showed a dramatic 33-fold increase in blood vessel formation in mice. The
X1/2pal-i3 pepducin completely inhibited MMP1-dependent angiogenesis compared with a negative control
pepducin or vehicle. Conversely, a vascular endothelial growth factor–directed antibody, Avastin, suppressed
angiogenesis in mice but, as expected, was unable to inhibit IL-8 and GRO-α–dependent endothelial tube
formation in vitro. These studies identify a critical MMP1-PAR1-CXCR1/2 paracrine pathway that might be
therapeutically targeted for ovarian cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 70(14); 5880–90. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Chemokines have traditionally been viewed as attractants
for inflammatory leukocytes, however, accumulating evidence suggests that they play important roles in modulating
the tumor-stromal microenvironment (1–3). Ovarian cancer
is a lethal disease that recruits a network of chemokines, proteases, and their receptors to grow and metastasize with no
anatomic barriers to prevent peritoneal dissemination (4). Inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL8 [interleukin (IL)-8],
CXCL6 (IL-6), CXCL1 [growth-regulated oncogene-α (GRO-α)],
and CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) are highly
upregulated in epithelial ovarian cancers (5–7) and are posAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Molecular Oncology Research Institute,

tulated to play pivotal functions in tumor growth, inflammation, angiogenesis, and metastasis (2, 6, 8).
IL-8 and GRO-α, ligands for the CXCR1 and CXCR2 chemokine receptors, are produced by the ovulating follicle to
attract leukocytes and assist in ovulation (9), and IL-8 and
IL-8 antibodies have been detected in the serum of patients
with ovarian cancer (10). Upregulated IL-8 expression has
been shown to be a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer (2, 11), and more recently, has been associated with poor
clinical outcome and worse survival in patients with ovarian
cancer (12). IL-8 is a strong stimulator of capillary tube formation via both CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors (13) and coculturing of cancer cells with stromal fibroblasts causes an
induction in IL-8, GRO-α, and GRO-β oncogenes (14). Moreover, GRO-α is expressed at higher levels in the tissue and
serum of patients with ovarian cancer as compared with normal women (15).
Recent work has shown that thrombin activation of proteaseactivated receptor-1 (PAR1) causes an induction of GRO-α in
breast carcinoma and melanoma (16). PARs are a unique
class of G protein–coupled receptors that are activated by
proteolytic cleavage of their extracellular domains (17).
PAR1 has been identified as an oncogene and a potent invasogenic receptor for breast, ovarian, melanoma, and prostate

MMP1-PAR1 Paracrine Signaling through Angiogenic Chemokines

carcinoma cells (18–24). We recently found that matrix
metalloprotease-1 (MMP1) also functions as a protease agonist of PAR1 cleaving the receptor (22, 25) to generate PAR1dependent migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in breast
and ovarian tumors (22, 23, 26, 27). Furthermore, we found
that fluids from patients with ovarian cancer harbor high levels of MMP1 which correlates with malignancy. Inhibition of
PAR1 results in a pronounced reduction of stromal infiltration and angiogenesis in mouse models of breast and ovarian
cancer. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of
the MMP1-PAR1 signaling system in paracrine communication to the endothelial cells and angiogenesis.
Here, we tested the hypothesis that MMP1-activated PAR1
is a critical regulator of cancer-stromal communication and
angiogenesis in ovarian carcinomas through paracrine control of chemokine production and endothelial CXCR1/2
receptors. To block these angiogenic chemokine receptors,
we used cell-penetrating pepducins based on the intracellular loops of CXCR1 and CXCR2 (28). Pepducins are lipidated
peptides that act on the inside surface of the cell membrane
and block signaling between their cognate receptor and its G
protein effectors. The first (i1) and third (i3) loops of CXCR1
and CXCR2 receptors are identical and pepducins based on
these loops are potent antagonists of both receptors. Pepducins have been extensively studied in the context of PAR and
chemokine receptor signaling, and have been shown to possess drug-like properties through pharmacologic and efficacy
studies in various animal models of angiogenesis, cancer,
thrombosis, and inflammation (22, 23, 25–30).
We found that MMP1-PAR1 stimulation of ovarian carcinoma cells leads to the secretion of angiogenic chemokines,
in particular, IL-8 and GRO-α. Medium from MMP1-stimulated
ovarian carcinoma cells produced a florid angiogenesis both
in vitro and in mice. The X1/2pal-i3 pepducin completely inhibited the effects of MMP1 in angiogenesis models, indicating that the MMP1-PAR1-CXCR1/2 paracrine system might
be an attractive new target to block angiogenesis in ovarian
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Pepducins
The CXCR1/2 pepducins X1/2pal-i3 (C15H31CONH-RTLFKAHMGQKHRAMR-NH2), X1/2LCA-i1 (lithocholic-CONHYSRVGRSVTD-NH2), and the PAR1-based negative control
pepducin P1pal-19E (C 15 H 31 CONH-RCESSSAEANRSKKERELF-NH2) were synthesized by standard N-(9-fluorenyl)
methoxycarbonyl solid phase methods as before (29, 30).
Palmitic acid and lithocholic acid were dissolved in 50%
N-methyl pyrolidone/50% methylene chloride and coupled
overnight to the deprotected NH2-terminal amine of the peptide. After cleavage from the resin, palmitoylated peptides
were purified to >95% purity by C18 or C4 reverse phase liquid
chromatography and dissolved in DMSO as before (28).
Reagents
Quantikine ELISAs for human IL-8, GRO-α, and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A-165, were obtained from

www.aacrjournals.org

R&D Systems and used as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant human IL-8 and GRO-α were commercially
obtained from PeproTech. Pure pro-MMP1 was obtained from
EMD BioSciences, FN-439 (MMP Inh-1) from Calbiochem
and human α-thrombin was from Haematologic Technologies and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-dipheyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Angiogenesis array
The human angiogenesis antibody array (AAH-ANG-1) was
bought from RayBiotech. The array membranes were incubated with either MMP1 or buffer-stimulated OVCAR-4
medium and used as recommended by the manufacturer.
Results were calibrated using ImageJ by comparing signal
intensities in the membranes after simultaneous exposure
to X-ray film. Stock solutions of 800 nmol/L of pro-MMP1 were
activated with 2 mmol/L of aminophenylmercuric acetate
(APMA) in 50 mmol/L of Tris (pH 7.7), 5 mmol/L of CaCl2,
0.2 mol/L of NaCl, 50 μmol/L of ZnCl2 at 37°C for 30 minutes
before being kept on ice. The APMA was then removed by
overnight dialysis in 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff Mini
Slide-A-Lyzers (Pierce) at 4°C as previously described (23).
Cell culture
OVCAR-4, OVCAR-3, and IGROV-1 cells were obtained
from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD) and were
grown in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were
serum-starved for 7 hours in RPMI with 0.1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) then stimulated with MMP1 or vehicle
and conditioned media (CM) was collected 18 hours later.
OVCAR-4 PAR1 shRNAi cells were stable cell lines prepared
by transfecting OVCAR-4 cells with PAR1 shRNAi from Sigma
using OligofectAMINE and selecting clones with puromycin
(0.5 μg/mL). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
were bought from Cambrex (Lonza) and cultured in EBM2
medium with Bullet kit and 10% fetal bovine serum. HUVEC
cells were serum-starved in EBM2 medium with 0.5% BSA.
Flow cytometry
A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to PAR1 was purified
by peptide affinity chromatography as previously described
(20). FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Zymed. Flow cytometry was performed on ovarian carcinoma cells as before (23). CXCR1 (IL8-RA) and CXCR2
(IL8-RB) chemokine receptor antibodies were bought from
R&D Systems.
Tube formation assay
MatTek plates were chilled to 4°C and coated with 100 μL
of Matrigel per well. Freshly passaged HUVEC cells (35,000;
P2-5) in EBM2 media with 0.5% BSA were plated on matrigelcoated MatTek plates and stimulated with either IL-8, GRO-α,
or MMP1-stimulated OVCAR-4 CM. MMP1-stimulated CM
was quenched with FN-439 before adding the CM to the
HUVEC cells. Endothelial tube morphogenesis was carried
out in the presence or absence of X1/2pal-i3, X1/2LCA-i1,
P1pal-19E pepducins (300 nmol/L), Avastin (0.25 mg/mL),
or vehicle (0.2% DMSO). Endothelial tube formation was

observed after 18 hours and endothelial tubes were photographed under phase contrast microscopy using an inverted
Olympus microscope. Quantification of the digital images
was performed in a blinded manner by counting total tubes
per five 40× fields and quantified for tube length and branch
complexity using NIH ImageJ software. Tube formation was
expressed as fold change or percentage over the controls.
MTT assay
HUVEC cells were plated in 96-well plates and subjected
to various treatment conditions or vehicle (0.2% DMSO) for
72 hours. MTT reagent was added at a concentration of
0.5 mg/mL and allowed to incubate at 37°C for 5 hours.
The resulting formazan crystals were dissolved with 100%
DMSO and absorbance was measured on a SPECTRmax
340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
Matrigel plug assays and ovarian cancer
xenografts in mice
All animal experiments were conducted in full compliance
with Tufts Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Female NCR nu/nu mice (5–7 weeks) were purchased from Taconic Farms. Mice were injected s.c. into their
flanks with 300 μL matrigel plugs consisting of equal volumes
of CM and matrigel. Animals were subsequently treated
with either X1/2pal-i3, X1/2 LCA-i3, P1pal-19E pepducin
(5 mg/kg/d × 7 d), Avastin (5 mg/kg), or vehicle (15% DMSO)
in 100-μL volumes. At the end of 7 days, mice were euthanized and plugs were excised and fixed in 10% formalin/
PBS. For ovarian cancer xenografts, OVCAR-4 cells were injected s.c. into each flank of female NCR nu/nu mice. The
mice were treated 24 hours later with either X1/2pal-i3 or
vehicle (15% DMSO) until day 30. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula, V = length × diameter2/2. On day 30,
mice were euthanized and tumors were harvested for assessment of angiogenesis.
Confocal microscopy of matrigel plugs and ovarian
cancer xenografts
Subcutaneously implanted matrigel plugs or tumors were
removed, cleaned, and fixed overnight with 10% formalin.
Plugs were blocked for 1 hour with 5% goat serum in TBS
containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (TBST) and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody CD31 (Millipore) diluted
1:1,000 in TBST. After several washes with TBST, plugs or
tumors were then incubated with fluorescently tagged secondary antibody Cy3 anti-hamster (Jackson Immunolabs) diluted in TBST for 4 hours. Plugs and tumors were washed
and postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes.
Whole mounted matrigel plugs and tumors were imaged
using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Confocal images
were constructed into three-dimensional projections of Z
stacks. Quantification of images was performed using NIH
ImageJ.

Results and Discussion
MMP1 induces chemokine production from ovarian
cancer cells in a PAR1-dependent manner
MMP1 activation of PAR1 has recently been implicated in
tumor angiogenesis of breast and ovarian cancers (22, 23, 27),
but the mechanism of action of PAR1-dependent tumorendothelial cell communication is not well understood.
Therefore, we first characterized the profile of angiogenic
factors that resulted from the stimulation of PAR1 in ovarian
cancer cells (Fig. 1A). We exposed a high PAR1-expressing
ovarian carcinoma cell line, OVCAR-4, to MMP1 and found
that several angiogenic factors were secreted into the CM.
As shown in Fig. 1A, the CXCR1/2 chemokines IL-8 and
GRO (α/β/γ), and the CCR2 chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were the most highly upregulated angiogenic/inflammatory factors with a 4- to 5.5-fold increase
above baseline (P < 0.005). Thrombin, a PAR1 agonist, is
known to upregulate VEGF-A in chick allantoic membrane
and human vascular smooth muscle cells (31, 32), however,
we noted no significant change in VEGF-A levels (the two
major isoforms, 165 and 121) following MMP1 stimulation
and a slight increase in VEGF-D (Fig. 1A). Other chemotactic
and angiogenic factors such as angiogenin were increased by
1.5- to 3-fold following MMP1 stimulation of OVCAR-4 cells
(Fig. 1A). We focused on the CXCR1/2 chemokine receptors
and their two major agonists, IL-8 and Gro-α, because we recently developed the first dual antagonist pepducins targeted
against both receptors (28).
To confirm the findings of the cytokine array, we tested
whether MMP1 stimulated IL-8 and GRO-α secretion in several ovarian cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of PAR1.
PAR1 surface expression was quantified on the OVCAR-4
(high), IGROV-1 (medium), and OVCAR-3 (low) ovarian cancer cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a PAR1specific antibody (Fig. 1B). In addition, we performed stable
knockdown of PAR1 in the high PAR1-expressing OVCAR-4
using shRNAi (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1). ELISA analysis
validated that MMP1 treatment caused increased secretion
of IL-8 from PAR1-expressing OVCAR-4 and IGROV-1 cells
(P < 0.005) but had no effect on the low PAR1-expressing cell
line, OVCAR-3, or following gene silencing of PAR1 in OVCAR4 (Fig. 1C). A similar pattern in GRO-α secretion was confirmed by a GRO-α ELISA for OVCAR-4 and IGROV-1 cells,
whereas the low PAR1 expressing OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-4/
PAR1-shRNA cells did not show an increase in GRO-α when
stimulated with MMP1 (Fig. 1D).
We also blocked the effect of PAR1 in the ovarian cancer
cells with a PAR1 small molecule antagonist RWJ-56110 (33)
and a PAR1 antagonist pepducin, P1pal-7 (23, 27, 29, 30). Pepducins are lipidated peptides based on the intracellular loops
of the G protein–coupled receptor that have been previously
validated in animal models of thrombosis, sepsis, and cancer
(23, 27, 29, 30, 34–36). We observed that IL-8 induction by
MMP1 and thrombin was inhibited by RWJ-56110 or P1pal-7

(Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S2A), confirming that the proteaseinduced production of IL-8 was PAR1-dependent. The PAR1
inhibitors RWJ-56110 and P1pal-7 were also able to inhibit
the GRO-α increases induced by MMP1 and thrombin
(Figs. 1D and 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2B). By comparison,
VEGF-A-165 levels (Fig. 1E) remained essentially unchanged
(0.9- to 1.15-fold) following MMP1 stimulation in the ovarian cancer cell lines tested. As was observed with MMP1,
thrombin stimulation of PAR1 caused the secretion of
IL-8 and GRO-α, and gave only a slight induction in
VEGF-A-165 in OVCAR-4 and OVCAR-3 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2C).

MMP1-PAR1 stimulation of ovarian carcinoma cells
triggers endothelial tube formation
We next investigated the angiogenic potential of IL-8 and
GRO-α induction by the MMP1-PAR1 signaling system in
endothelial cells. Medium from OVCAR-4 cells stimulated
with either MMP1 or vehicle was added to freshly cultured
HUVEC seeded on matrigel and incubated overnight. As
MMP1 could stimulate endothelial cells directly (37, 38), we
quenched any residual MMP1 activity with the MMP1 inhibitor FN-439 before adding the CM to the HUVECs. Consistent
with our hypothesis, MMP1 CM containing elevated levels
of IL-8 and GRO-α and basal levels of VEGF enhanced tube

formation and branching complexity of the endothelial cells
by 4-fold (Fig. 2A-B). Furthermore, the MMP1 paracrine
effect on tube formation could be significantly attenuated
by pretreating OVCAR-4 cells with the MMP1 inhibitor
FN-439, or the PAR1 antagonists RWJ-56110 or P1pal-7
(Fig. 2A and B). Taken together, these findings suggest
that the MMP1-induced paracrine communication between
ovarian carcinoma cells and endothelial cells was mediated
through PAR1.
A cell-penetrating CXCR1/2 pepducin blocks IL-8 and
GRO-α–stimulated endothelial cell proliferation
The chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 are expressed on the endothelium and are important for endothelial survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis (13, 39). We
confirmed the presence of CXCR1/2 chemokine receptors
on our endothelial cells using flow cytometry (Fig. 3A).
IL-8 and GRO-α were highly potent inducers of endothelial
cell proliferation, with EC50 values of 200 and 600 pmol/L,
respectively (Fig. 3B). The effects of IL-8 and GRO-α on endothelial cell proliferation were completely blocked by the
X1/2pal-i3 pepducin (Fig. 3B), a palmitoylated pepducin

based on the third intracellular loop of the CXCR1/2 chemokine receptors (28).
We then tested whether medium from the MMP1stimulated OVCAR-4 cells could cause endothelial cell proliferation. As expected, the MMP1-OVCAR-4 media induced
mitogenesis and proliferation by 3.5- to 4.5-fold (Fig. 3C).
The mitogenic effect of MMP1 was not observed in the low
PAR1–expressing OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 3C). The MMP1induced proliferation was inhibited by the addition of X1/
2pal-i3 to the HUVECs (Fig. 3D), again demonstrating that
the observed paracrine effect between the ovarian cancer
cells and the endothelial cells was dependent on the
CXCR1/2 receptors. Exogenous IL-8 and GRO-α also stimulated the migration of endothelial cells in a wound-healing
migration assay which was blocked by X1/2pal-i3 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The X1/2pal-i3 pepducin blocks IL-8 and GRO-α–
stimulated endothelial cell tube formation
As MMP1 caused a 4-fold increase in both IL-8 and GRO-α
secretion from carcinoma cells, we tested the ability of these
chemokines to induce endothelial cell tube formation on

Figure 2. CXCR1/2 chemokines produced by MMP1 stimulation of OVCAR-4 cells lead to tube formation of endothelial cells. OVCAR-4 cells (0.2 million)
were plated in each well of a six-well plate, serum starved, and then treated overnight with either PBS buffer or 1 nmol/L of MMP1 in the presence or
absence of 0.2% DMSO vehicle, P1pal-7 (5 μmol/L), or RWJ-56110 (5 μmol/L). CM was collected and the residual MMP1 activity was quenched with
FN-439 (5 μmol/L). CM was then added to HUVECs (30, 000) on matrigel-coated 12-well MatTek plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. A, tube formation
of HUVECs was visualized at 40× magnification. B, tube formation in A was quantified using ImageJ software in a blinded manner. As indicated, FN-439
(5 μmol/L) was also added to the OVCAR4 cells prior to MMP1 treatment. Columns, means are representative of two or more experiments performed
in triplicate; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05 and **, P < 0.005.

matrigel-coated wells. Exogenous IL-8 and GRO-α caused a
23-fold increase in branch point complexity and a 13-fold increase in tube length over unstimulated controls (Fig. 4A).
This effect was significantly inhibited by 300 nmol/L of X1/
2pal-i3 but not by Avastin (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the effect
was mediated through the CXCR1/2 receptors. In the reciprocal experiment, exogenous VEGF stimulated HUVEC tube
formation, which was significantly inhibited by Avastin but
not by X1/2pal-i3 (Supplementary Fig. S4). To validate the
inhibitory effects of the CXCR1/2 pepducins on endothelial
tube formation, we used neutralizing antibodies to the
IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. The CXCR1 and CXCR2
neutralizing antibodies significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed

length by 58% as compared with control IgG (Supplementary
Fig. S5), quantitatively similar to the inhibition observed with
the X1/2pal-i3 pepducin.
We further tested whether X1/2pal-i3 was able to block
endothelial cell tube formation induced by medium from
MMP1-stimulated ovarian carcinoma cells. We used two
different CXCR1/2 pepducins—X1/2pal-i3 and X1/2LCA-i1
(a lithocholic-tagged i1 loop of CXCR1/2), and a negative
control pepducin P1pal-19E based on the i3 loop of PAR1
(29), which has a similar structure to X1/2pal-i3. Both X1/
2pal-i3 and X1/2LCA-i1 significantly inhibited endothelial cell
tube formation and branch complexity induced by the medium from MMP1-stimulated ovarian carcinoma cells, whereas
P1pal-19E had no effect (Fig. 4B). These data provide further

evidence that the CXCR1/2 pepducins were specifically
blocking the CXCR1/2 receptors to inhibit tube formation.
A CXCR1/2 pepducin suppresses angiogenesis in mice
Next, we tested whether the X1/2pal-i3 pepducin would inhibit blood vessel formation in mouse models of angiogenesis. As stimulation of ovarian carcinoma cells produced a
marked increase in the secretion of both IL-8 and GRO-α,
we first spiked unstimulated ovarian carcinoma cell media
with IL-8 plus GRO-α versus buffer alone and added the mixtures to matrigel plugs, which were injected into the flanks of
nude mice. Mice receiving the IL-8/GRO-α matrigel plugs
were divided into three treatment groups. The mice were injected s.c. with either vehicle, X1/2pal-i3 or Avastin. On day 7,
the matrigel plugs were harvested and stained for blood
vessel formation. Unstimulated CM (buffer-treated) from
OVCAR-4 cells containing basal levels of VEGF, IL-8, and
GRO-α were unable to form blood vessels. The addition of
IL-8/GRO-α to the unstimulated ovarian carcinoma cell me-

dia caused a dramatic increase (P = 0.0016) in angiogenesis
within the plugs as compared with media with buffer alone,
which was completely blocked by treatment with X1/2pal-i3
(P = 0.0075; Fig. 5A). Treatment with Avastin also significantly inhibited angiogenesis, suggesting that the basal levels of
VEGF (∼200 pg/mL) in the OVCAR-4 CM were contributing
to the IL-8/GROα–driven angiogenesis in vivo. These basal
levels of VEGF, however, were not sufficient to stimulate
angiogenesis in the mice as the unstimulated CM from the
OVCAR-4 cells did not support angiogenesis without supplementation with IL-8 and GRO-α.
Mice were then injected with matrigel mixed with media
from MMP1-stimulated OVCAR-4 cells. These mice were
divided into the following treatment groups: X1/2pal-i3
(5 mg/kg/d × 7 days), Avastin (5 mg/kg), or negative control
i3 loop pepducin P1pal-19E (5 mg/kg/d × 7 days). Mice injected with MMP1-stimulated OVCAR-4 CM showed a significant 33-fold increase in blood vessel formation as assessed
by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5B). As observed above, Avastin

CXCR1/2 pepducin X1/2pal-i3. HUVECs were added to matrigel-coated MatTek wells and stimulated with IL-8 (60 nmol/L) plus GRO-α (60 nmol/L) or
IL-8 alone (30 nmol/L) in the presence of X1/2pal-i3 (300 nmol/L), Avastin (0.25 mg/mL), and/or PBS buffer control ( — ) and incubated overnight. Tube
formation was quantified by ImageJ software in a blinded manner to assess tube length and branch point complexity. B, OVCAR-4 cells were plated in each
well of a six-well plate, serum starved, and then treated overnight with 1 nmol/L of MMP1. Stimulated CM was collected and residual MMP1 activity
quenched with FN-439 before adding to the HUVEC cells. Tube formation was assessed after 24 h in the presence of 300 nmol/L of CXCR1/2 pepducins
X1/2pal-i3, X1/2LCA-i1, or control PAR1 i3 pepducin P1pal-19E or 0.2% DMSO vehicle ( — ). Tube formation was quantified by ImageJ software in a
blinded manner. Columns, mean representative of two or more experiments done in triplicate; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05 and **, P < 0.005.

MMP1-PAR1 Paracrine Signaling through Angiogenic Chemokines

Figure 5. X1/2pal-i3 blocks chemokine-induced angiogenesis in vivo. OVCAR-4 cells were serum-starved and treated with PBS buffer (A), or 1 nmol/L of
MMP1 (B) for 18 h. CM was then collected, mixed with equal parts matrigel and HUVECs (10,000), and injected as a plug into each flank of NCR nu/nu
female mice. A, IL-8 (60 nmol/L) plus GRO-α (60 nmol/L) was added to CM from unstimulated OVCAR-4 cells, mixed with matrigel and injected into
the flanks of mice. Mice with were then treated with either X1/2pal-i3 (5 mg/kg/d for 7 d), Avastin (5 mg/kg), or vehicle (15% DMSO) as indicated. After
7 d, the plugs were harvested and stained for blood vessel formation with a CD31 (PECAM) antibody, and analyzed by confocal microscopy in a blinded
manner. B, MMP1-stimulated OVCAR-4 CM was concentrated 6-fold and mixed with matrigel and HUVECs and injected into the flanks of NCR nu/nu mice.
The mice received either X1/2pal-i3 (5 mg/kg/d × 7 d), Avastin (5 mg/kg), P1pal-19E (5 mg/kg/d × 7 d), or vehicle (15% DMSO). After 7 d, plugs were

inhibited the MMP1-induced angiogenesis. Treatment of
mice with the CXCR1/2 antagonist pepducin X1/2pal-i3 gave
a striking reduction (P = 0.002) in blood vessel formation
(Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S6). However, the negative control i3 loop pepducin, P1pal-19E, had no effect on the mouse
model providing further evidence that the observed angiogenesis was mediated by the CXCR1/2 receptors.
X1/2pal-i3 blocks angiogenesis and inhibits tumor
growth in ovarian cancer xenografts
Lastly, we examined the effect of CXCR1/2 receptor blockade on ovarian cancer tumor growth and related these effects
on tumor angiogenesis. OVCAR-4 ovarian carcinoma cells
were s.c. injected into the flanks of female NCR nu/nu mice.
The mice were then randomly divided into two treatment
groups: X1/2pal-i3 or vehicle, and tumor volume was mea-

sured. After 30 days, the mice were euthanized and tumors
assessed for angiogenesis. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, mice
treated with the CXCR1/2 pepducin showed a significant
decrease in tumor volume on day 23 (P = 0.01) and at the
30-day end point (P = 0.02). The X1/2pal-i3–treated tumors
also showed a highly significant (P < 0.0001) 5-fold decrease
in angiogenesis (Fig. 6C), confirming an important role
for the CXCR1/2 receptors in ovarian tumor growth and
angiogenesis.
Targeting MMP1-chemokine communication in ovarian
cancer angiogenesis
Angiogenesis inhibitors, as exemplified by the VEGF antibody Avastin, have recently emerged as potential treatments
for recurrent ovarian and primary peritoneal cancer (40, 41).
Nonetheless, anti-VEGF therapy has not universally been able

to translate response rates into cure rates in patients (42),
necessitating the need to identify new pathways involved in
tumor-stromal interactions. However, there is limited information regarding the involvement of other tumor-produced
angiogenic factors and their cognate receptors in ovarian
cancer angiogenesis. In this study, we found that the metalloprotease MMP1, a poor prognostic factor for ovarian
cancer (43, 44), mediates tumor-stromal communication by
stimulating the release of angiogenic chemokines IL-8 and
GRO-α via the PAR1 receptor on the ovarian carcinoma cells.
The secreted GRO-α and IL-8 chemokines then act in a paracrine manner to promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration, tube formation, and angiogenesis. A cell-penetrating
X1/2pal-i3 pepducin directed against both the CXCR1 and
CXCR2 receptors was able to block the MMP1-induced effects of IL-8 and GRO-α on the endothelial cells and inhibited
tumor progression and angiogenesis in ovarian cancer xenografts. These findings are consistent with our previous observations that upstream blockade of MMP1-PAR1 also
significantly inhibited angiogenesis in mouse models of ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis (23).
Proangiogenic factors such as IL-8 and Gro-α are upregulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase activation of the
NF-κB and activator protein-1 transcription factors in many

cell types including inflammatory cells, endothelial, and carcinoma cells (45). Although little is known regarding PAR1dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways
in ovarian carcinoma cells, both thrombin and MMP1 have
been shown to upregulate IL-8 gene expression in melanoma
cells, presumably through PAR1 (21, 46). We found that
MMP1 activation of PAR1 did not significantly stimulate
VEGF-A production above basal levels from the ovarian carcinoma cells. Despite this, Avastin had a partial inhibitory effect on the IL-8/GROα-induced angiogenesis in mice. This
inhibition might be due to the synergistic effects of VEGF-A
on IL-8 in endothelial cells. Indeed, recent studies have
shown that IL-8 could induce the physical interaction of
CXCR1/2 with VEGFR2 and cause subsequent activation of
RhoA (47). RhoA is critical for endothelial angiogenesis
(48), suggesting that there may be a critical relationship between VEGF and IL-8 in promoting angiogenesis. Other reports showed that shRNAi knockdown of GRO-α impaired
tumor growth and angiogenesis in melanoma (16), and silencing IL-8 expression with lipocalated RNAi decreased
ovarian tumor growth (12).
Novel treatment strategies in ovarian cancer have combined
standard chemotherapeutics with angiogenesis-inhibiting
agents to prolong survival as maintenance therapy (49) and

injected s.c. into each flank of female NCR
nu/nu mice. Mice (n = 8) were treated 24 h later
with either X1/2pal-i3 (5 mg/kg/d × 6/7 d) or
vehicle (15% DMSO) until day 30, and tumor
volume was measured with calipers. C, on day
30, mice were euthanized and tumors were
harvested, fixed in formalin, and stained with
CD31 and subjected to confocal microscopy to
assess angiogenesis. Columns, mean; bars, SE.

as adjuvants in metronomic chemotherapy (50). However,
the rich peritoneal milieu that promotes growth and angiogenesis for the spread of ovarian cancer provides multiple
communication pathways that might need to be interrupted
to prevent metastasis. As exemplified by the inhibitory effects
of the CXCR1/2 pepducins, this study presents a potential
orthogonal strategy to target ovarian cancer angiogenesis
and progression.
