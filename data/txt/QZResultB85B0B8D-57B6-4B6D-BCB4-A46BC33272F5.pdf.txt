ABSTRACT:
Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers
worldwide, especially in Western countries. Although chemotherapy is used as an
adjuvant or as a palliative treatment, drug resistance poses a great challenge. This
study intended to identify biomarkers as predictive factors for chemotherapy.
Patients and methods: By microarray analysis, we studied miRNAs expression
profiles in CRC patient, comparing chemoresistant and chemosensitive groups. The
miRNAs of interest were validated and the impact on clinical outcomes was assessed
in a cohort of 295 patients. To search for potential targets of these miRNAs, tissue
samples were subject to in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analysis.
Colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were also used for in vitro experimentation, where
cellular invasiveness and drug resistance were examined in miRNA-transfected cells.
Results: The expression level of miRNA-17-5p was found increased in
chemoresistant patients. Significantly higher expression levels of miR-17-5p were
found in CRC patients with distant metastases and higher clinical stages. KaplanMeier analysis showed that CRC patients with higher levels of miR-17-5p had
reduced survival, especially in patients who had previously received chemotherapy.
Overexpression of miR-17-5p promoted COLO205 cell invasiveness. We found that
PTEN was a target of miR-17-5p in the colon cancer cells, and their context-specific
interactions were responsible for multiple drug-resistance. Chemotherapy was found
to increase the expression levels of miR-17-5p, which further repressed PTEN levels,
contributing to the development of chemo-resistance.
Conclusions: MiR-17-5p is a predictive factor for chemotherapy response and
a prognostic factor for overall survival in CRC, which is due to its regulation of PTEN
expression.

surgery remains the mainstream treatment course, with
or without adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. In
patients at advanced stages, palliative chemotherapy has
been demonstrated to improve survival, by preventing
tumour invasion or downsizing distant metastatic lesions.
In the past three decades, the use of fluorouracil (5-FU),
combined with irinotecan and oxaliplatin has been shown
to double overall survival [2]. However, drug resistance
poses a great challenge in treating chemorefractory
patients. One of the most challenging tasks is to identify
patient subpopulations that are most likely to respond
to specific therapies. Therefore, understanding the
mechanisms underlying chemoresistance may help identify
subgroup of patients who may benefit from chemotherapy
and avoid over-treatment. Despite enormous efforts,
only a few predictive and prognostic biomarkers have
been validated clinically [3]. Studies have shown that
multiple cellular processes including DNA repair, cell
apoptosis and proliferation may play important role in
chemoresistance [4-6]. Several clinical studies have been
performed in an attempt to find biomarkers predicting
benefit from chemotherapy. However, with the exception
of KRAS mutations, none of these studied markers have
entered into the clinical management of colorectal cancer
[7]. Given that complex signalling pathways and their
cross-talk contribute to chemoresistance in a temporal- and
spatial-specific manner, single molecular markers might
not be sufficient to predict entire clinical outcomes. Thus,
there is a great demanding to identify better markers that
can enhance the prognostic strength in the clinical setting.
In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been
recognized as key regulators of gene expression at the
post-transcriptional level [8]. They are broadly involved
in tumour proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and drug
resistance [9-13]. High-frequency miRNA dysfunction is
also associated with colorectal cancer development and
progression [14]. It has been shown that miRNAs can be
used as biomarkers for cancer detection [15]. One miRNA
may be able to target several pathways, facilitating tumour
cells evasion of drug treatment and generating stem-like
cells [16]. Therefore, it is of value to illuminate whether
dysregulation of these miRNAs-regulatory networks are
also responsible for chemorefractory colorectal cancer.
We identified miR-17-5p as a chemotherapy response
predictor and prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer.
We found that miR-17-5p responded to chemotherapy
by changing the levels of its target PTEN. Up-take of
antisense oligo against miR-17-5p could successfully
sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy.

Expression of miR-17 in the course of colorectal
cancer chemoresistance
To search for potential miRNA targets in the course
of colorectcal cancer (CRC) chemoresistance, we started
with the analysis of miRNA expression profiles of CRC
tissues collected before neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
A comparison of miRNA expression levels between
chemoresistant and chemosensitive groups are shown
in Fig 1a. There were six miRNAs (miR-17-5p, miR19b, miR-20a, miR-592, miR-7 and miR-93) showing
consistently elevated levels in chemoresistant patients.
Among them, miR-17-5p, miR-19b, miR-20a, miR93 belonged to the miR-17~92 cluster and one of its
paralogous clusters, miR-106b~25. Their overexpression
has shown to be associated with many malignancies such
as leukemia, liver and prostate cancer [17]. To confirm
their potential roles in chemoresistance, validation
experiments were carried out by qRT-PCR in seven
chemoresistant and eight chemosensitive colorectal cancer
samples. We found that the chemoresistant colorectal
cancer samples had a significantly higher level of miR17-5p than those obtained from chemosensitive colorectal
cancer patients (Fig 1b, p=0.001, Mann Whitney test).
We further analyzed the association between
miR-17-5p expression and therapeutic outcomes in
CRC patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. The
chemotherapy regimens were primarily fluorouracilbased, with leucovorin and oxaliplatin. Kaplan-Meier
analysis demonstrated that high miR-17-5p expression
was associated with a worse prognosis in CRC patients
with chemotherapy (p=0.001), further indicating its
potential as a predictive biomarker for chemotherapy (Fig
1c). Multivariate Cox regression showed increased miR17-5p expression was predictive of a worse prognosis in
CRC patients receiving chemotherapy (Table 1, HR 4.06,
95% CI 1.24 to 13.36, p=0.021). Therefore, miR-17-5p
expression emerged as a predictive factor in the clinical
outcomes of CRC patients treated with chemotherapy. We
then analyzed association between miR-17-5p expression
and survival in both early stage (Stage I and II) and late
stage (Stage III and IV) CRC patients. A significant
relationship between expression of miR-17-5p and overall
survival rate in early stage CRC patients was not found.
However, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that in late
stage CRC patients, high miR-17-5p expression levels
were associated with a worse prognosis, especially for
patients who had received chemotherapy (Fig 1c).

(b) A validation experiment was carried out using qRT-PCR. Expressions of miR-17-5p from fifteen primary colorectal cancer

patients who consecutively underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed. Among them, seven patients were defined as complete
response/partial response (CR/PR), while eight patients were defined as stable disease/progressive disease (SD/PD). Chemoresistant cancer
samples have significantly higher levels of miR-17-5p (p=0.001, Mann Whitney Test).

survival, especially among those who received chemotherapy (P=0.002, Kaplan-Meier log rank test).

concentration (IC50) to cultured COLO205 cells. After
12 hour treatment, miR-17-transfected cells showed
greater resistance towards these chemotherapeutic agents,
with more cells surviving after the treatment (Fig 2b and

Supplementary Fig S1b). We then conducted an apoptosis
assay to verify our findings through flow cytometry and
found that miR-17 overexpression decreased cellular
apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic treatments (Fig
2c).
In a previous study, we found that the loss of PTEN
resulted in activation of downstream signaling pathways,
which accounted for the drug resistance observed in
cancer cells [16]. To trace the change of PTEN during the
course of chemotherapy, we analyzed the levels of PTEN
expression by Western blotting. Although PTEN was
down-regulated in the miR-17-transfected cells before
Irinotecan treatment, a much more drastic decrease was
observed following Irinotecan treatment (Fig 2d, left).
Consistent with these results was the up-regulation of
pAKT. We also found a concomitant up-regulation of
miR-17-5p, which was substantially increased in response
to chemotherapeutic treatment (Fig 2d, right). It appears

that targeting of PTEN by endogenous miR-17-5p
became a prominent factor in cellular stress induced by
the chemotherapeutic regimens. We hypothesize that miR17-5p is a central mediator of chemoresistance, enabling
colorectal cancer cells to escape chemotherapy.

PTEN as a target of miR-17-5p in colorectal
cancer cells
PTEN is a tumour suppressor which dominates the
PTEN/AKT/PI3K pathway. Loss of PTEN and activation
of AKT has been reported in many types of cancers,
including hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate adenoma and
colorectal cancer [18]. Through computational analysis,
we found that the 3’-untranslated region of PTEN mRNA
contained two binding sites for miR-17-5p (Fig 3a).
Western blot analysis was thereby performed and PTEN
was found decreased in miR-17-transfected cells (Fig 3b).

(a) Real-time PCR was performed to measure miR-17-5p levels in COLO205 and SW480 cells transfected with the
control vector or miR-17. Increased RNA levels were observed in the miR-17-transfected cells compared to vector control.
(b) COLO205 cells were treated with Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan and Fluorouracil (5-FU) overnight, followed by counting

(c) COLO205 cells were treated with Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan and Fluorouracil overnight, followed by analysis of
apoptosis. There were fewer cells undergoing apoptosis in the miR-17 overexpression group.
(d) Left, COLO205 cells were cultured in medium with or without Irinotecan. Cell lysate prepared was analyzed on Western

blot for expression of PTEN and pAKT. While cells transfected with miR-17 expressed lower level of PTEN than the control, treatment
with Irinotecan further decreased PTEN levels, especially in cells overexpressing miR-17. Staining of β-actin from the same membrane
confirmed equal loading. On the other hand, expression of pAKT was opposite. Right, Irinotecan treatment increased miR-17-5p levels,
especially in the cells transfected with miR-17 overexpression plasmid.

We then generated firefly luciferase reporter constructs
with the 3’UTR of PTEN mRNA, and transfected them
into colorectal cancer cells with miR-17-5p mimics. We
found that co-transfection with miR-17-5p in SW480
and COLO205 cells decreased luciferase activity when
the construct contained the 3’UTR of PTEN (Fig 3c, Fig
3d). Mutation of the binding sites reversed the observed
inhibitory effects.
Next we conducted In Situ Hybridization (ISH)

assays to detect miR-17-5p expression in colorectal
cancer tissues. PTEN expression was also analyzed by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in these samples (Fig 4a). In
cancer tissues where miR-17-5p was overexpressed (Fig
4aV), PTEN was down-regulated (Fig 4aVI). Consistent
with this, low expression of miR-17-5p was correlated
with high PTEN expression (Fig 4aVII vs. Fig 4aVIII).
We further validated the association between miR-175p and PTEN expression levels in 295 colorectal cancer
specimens. miR-17-5p was found elevated in 89 samples,
53 of which showed reduced expression levels of PTEN.
By Pearson Chi-square test, it was shown that miR-17-5p
was inversely correlated with PTEN expression (p=0.006)
(Fig 4b).
We then tested whether PTEN mediated the survival
effects observed in cancer cells treated by chemotherapy.
When treated with siRNA against PTEN, more cells
survived after chemotherapeutic treatment (Fig 5a). More

importantly, reconstruction of PTEN expression sensitized
these cells to cytotoxic drugs, with more cells undergoing
apoptosis and cell death (Fig 5b). By complementary
binding to miRNA, antagomir or antisense small RNAs
can arrest miRNA’s functioning by preventing further
processing [19]. When we transiently transfected antisense
oligos against miR-17-5p into COLO205 cells, we found
that the cells became more sensitive to drug treatment

than control cells (Fig 5c). Increased drug sensitivity was
observed in anti-miR-17-transfected cells, co-cultured
overnight with fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin.
These results suggested that miR-17 could be a therapeutic
target in the treatment of chemorefractory colorectal
cancer.

Relationship between mir-17-5p expression and
overall survival of CRC patients

cells.

To corroborate these results and counteract miR17’s effect, we overexpressed PTEN in COLO205 cells
(Fig 6h). As a consequence, we detected decreased cell
migration in the PTEN-overexpressing group by both
scratch wound (Fig 6i, Fig S2c) and trans-well migration
assays (Fig 6j, Fig S2d). Therefore, it was confirmed that
miR-17-5p enhanced invasiveness of colorectal cancer
cells by targeting the PTEN pathway. The addition of
cytotoxic drugs in culture media beforehand was not
found to counteract these aggressive migration phenotypes
(Data not shown). Given that increased motility is often
associated with higher metastasic capacity [22], our data
suggests that miR-17-5p promoted colorectal cancer cell
metastasis in a treatment-independent manner. In 81
colorectal patients with chemotherapy and 214 patients
without chemotherapy, miR-17-5p overexpression was
found to be predictive of worse overall survival (Tables
1, Table S2). Given our in vitro and in vivo results, we
concluded that miR-17 overexpression contributed to
tumour metastasis, leading to decreased overall survival
in CRC patients.

We assessed the impact of mir-17 expression on
overall survival in a patient cohort. The clinicopathological
characteristics of the CRC patients are summarized in
Supplementary Table S1. The testing cohort consisted
of 153 men and 142 women, with a total of 81 CRC
patients, who were treated by adjuvant chemotherapy.
High expression levels of miR-17-5p were found in
89/295 (30.17%) of patients. Significantly higher miR17-5p expression levels were found in CRC patients with
distant metastasis and higher clinical stages (Fig 6a, Table
S1). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that N status, distant
metastasis, clinical stage and miR-17-5p expression
were correlated with poor overall survival (Table 2).
CRC patients with high expression levels of miR-17-5p
had reduced survival than patients with low expression
levels of miR-17-5p (p=0.001, log-rank test, Fig 6b).
Further multivariate Cox regression analysis determined
that tumor location, N status, distant metastasis and
expression of miR-17-5p were independent prognostic
factors for the poor survival of CRC patents (Table 2).
The results also demonstrated that there was no significant
association between miR-17-5p expression and other
clinicopathological features, such as patient gender, age,
tumor location, T classification, N classification and
chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
Currently, fluorouracil based chemotherapy remains
a standard treatment course for patients with advanced
CRC. While improving patient survival and reducing
recurrence, chemotherapy resistance leading to treatment
failure and local recurrence is still a critical problem.
One of the biggest challenges is to identify patient
subpopulations that are most likely to respond to specific
therapies. If one or more biomarkers could predict patient’s
response to chemotherapy, we could more effectively treat
these patients, while redirecting other groups to alternative
strategies that could be more effective. Considering that
the poor prognosis in CRC patients is typically due to
late diagnosis and low chemotherapy response, it is of
importance to identify predictive markers of therapeutic
response.
In the present study, microRNA expression profile
was first examined in CRC samples from patients who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We discovered that
miR-17-5p was capable of conferring a responder or
nonresponder status in colorectal cancer patient samples.
Further results showed that miR-17-5p was an independent
predictive factor in patients who received chemotherapy.
We also demonstrated that miR-17-5p might induce
chemoresistance by regulating PTEN expression. In CRC
samples, the expression levels of miR-17-5p were found to
be correlated inversely with PTEN expression. Subsequent
analysis indicated that miR-17-5p was significantly
correlated with tumour metastasis and advanced clinical
stage. This suggested that the overexpression of miR17-5p in CRC may facilitate the invasive/metastatic
phenotype. Taken together, overexpression of miR-17-

Mir-17-5p promoted colorectal cancer cell
migration
Previous studies have shown that miR-17
overexpression is related to tumour cell growth [20]. In our
study, we found that neither cell survival (Fig S1c) nor cell
proliferation (Fig S1d) was altered by miR-17 transfection.
However, scratch wound assays performed on cancer cell
monolayers revealed that the miR-17-transfected cells
migrated faster than the control cells (Fig 6c, Fig S2a).
Moreover, when seeded on the upper chamber of transwell plates, more cells in the miR-17 group were able to
migrate through to the other side of the chamber (Fig 6d,
Fig S2b). Taken together, the miR-17-transfected colon
cancer cells showed greater motility in culture conditions,
which suggested higher metastatic potential in vivo. These
results were in line with our clinical findings, showing
that patients with metastatic disease had higher expression
levels of miR-17-5p (Table S2).
To validate miR-17’s function in colorectal cancer
cells, we employed siRNAs against PTEN to simulate
miR-17-5p overexpression (Fig 6e). Down-regulation of
PTEN would result in activation of the AKT/PI3K/HIF-1α
pathway, which contributed to cancer cell migration [21].
As expected, we detected increased cell motility (Fig 6f)
and cell invasion (Fig 6g, Fig S2b) in the siRNA treated

5p in CRC was a strong and independent predictor of
chemotherapy response and a prognostic biomarker for
worse survival. Examination of miR-17-5p expression
levels could be used as an additional tool in identifying
CRC patients who are in need of chemotherapy or are at a
risk of tumor metastasis.
Resistance to chemotherapy may arise from inherent
genetic instability or through selection of environmental
stress. Recently, miRNAs have emerged as crucial
mediators in regulating the cellular responses of cancer
cells to therapy. Patient response to chemotherapy has
shown to be closely correlated to the functional status
of microRNAs [23-25]. Although the mechanisms
of miRNA-regulated drug resistance are still largely
unknown, current evidence suggest several roles for
miRNA, including influence of therapeutic induced cell
death, alteration of drug targets, regulation of multiple
drug resistance (MDR)-related proteins, change in
bioavailable drug concentration and promotion of
angiogenesis and tumor stem-like cells (TSC) [10]. Some
miRNAs are capable of conferring drug resistance by
targeting PTEN. For example, it has been reported that
miR-214 induces cell survival and chemoresistance, by
binding the 3’UTR of PTEN mRNA [26]. In our previous
study, we found that miR-17-5p targeted an oncogene,
MDM2 and a tumor suppressor PTEN simultaneously,
resulting in chemoresistance and generation of TSCs
in glioblastoma [16]. Loss of PTEN is a very frequent
genetic aberration in malignant tumours such as breast
cancer, gastric cancer and glioblastoma. Various studies
have suggested that PTEN loss is significantly associated
with cytotoxic drug resistance [27, 28].
In this study, we found that miR-17-5p negatively
regulated PTEN expression in colorectal carcinoma cell
lines COLO205 and SW480. As a result, these cells
became more aggressive and invasive after transfected
with the miR-17 expression construct. Experiments in vitro
showed that the miR-17-transfected cells migrated faster
than control cells in both two- and three- dimensional
environments, which could be linked to more distant
metastasis in vivo. This finding is consistent with clinical
observations, which revealed that more advanced patients
expressed higher levels of miR-17-5p. There is growing
evidence suggesting that dysfunction of PTEN has
prognostic importance in several malignancies, including
colorectal cancer [29]. Our findings reveal that targeting
PTEN at the post-transcriptional level by miRNAs such
as miR-17-5p are also responsible for PTEN inactivation,
and are thereby associated with reduced survival in CRC
patients. PTEN down-regulation is closely correlated
with PI3K/Akt activation, and this cascade pathway
has profound effects on tumorigenesis, proliferation,
migration, and apoptosis. We did not observe a difference
in cell growth, which could be due to minimal repression
of PTEN translation in normal conditions. Interestingly,
we found that miR-17-5p levels were elevated upon
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapeutic stress, leading to increased knock-down
of PTEN. As a result, cells overexpressing miR-17-5p
survived better than the controls. PTEN exerts an essential
role in maintaining chromosomal integrity and cell cycle
progression [30]. In response to DNA damage, cancer cells
often activate PI3K/Akt pathway, which modulate cell
survival signalling and regulate DNA repair machinery
directly [31]. Moreover, inactivation of PTEN also has
a positive effect on cancer cell proliferation, which can
contribute to therapeutic resistance and tumour recurrence
[32]. Our studies suggest that the miRNA-regulatory
network might be the first responder in face of DNA
damaging signalling, and overexpression of miRNAs
trigger various response cascades for cell survival.
In summary, we identified miR-17-5p as a
chemotherapy response predictor and prognostic
biomarker in colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we found
that miR-17-5p responded to chemotherapy by changing
the levels of both itself and its target, PTEN. Up-take of
antisense oligo against miR-17-5p could successfully
sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. Future therapeutic
strategies could be developed based on the predictive
levels of miR-17-5p. Surgery, instead of chemotherapy,
might therefore be more suitable for colorectal cancer
patients with high levels of miR-17-5p expression. In
future, strategy could be developed to repress miR-17-5p
levels combined with chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Fifteen patients with primary colorectal cancer
who consecutively underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy
containing fluorouracil (5-FU) at the Department of
Colorectal Surgery, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-Sen University, were enrolled into the present study.
Tumor specimens were obtained by colonoscopy prior
to starting therapy. The effect of chemotherapy on the
tumors was assessed as the three-dimensional volume
reduction rate or tumor response rate. The tumor response
was evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST), which is defined as the
following: complete response (CR; disappearance of the
disease), partial response (PR; reduction of ≥30%), stable
disease (SD; reduction <30% or enlargement ≤20%), or
progressive disease (PD; enlargement ≥20%). Among
them, 7 patients were defined CR/PR, and 8 patients were
defined SD/PD.
Paraffin-embedded samples of primary colorectal
adenocarcinomas were included from 295 patients, who
underwent tumor resection between 2001 and 2005 at
the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University.
This cohort of patients with CRC included 153 (51.9%)
2983

men and 142 (48.1%) women, with a median age of
59 years, and their clinic-pathological characteristics
are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The cases
selected were based on a distinctive pathological diagnosis
of CRC, undergoing primary and curative resection for
CRC, availability of resection tissue, follow-up data, and
had not received preoperative anticancer treatment. Our
study protocol was approved by The Ethics Committee of
the First and the Sixth Affiliated Hospital.

at a defined position, using a tissue arraying instrument
(Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD).

In situ hybridization and Immunohistochemistry
For in situ hybridization, tissue slides were
deparaffinized and digested with proteinase K for
30 min. The slides were then prehybridized in a
hybridization solution at 570C for 2 hours. Ten picomoles
of digoxingenin-labeled miRCURY LNA detection
probes (Exiqon) complementary to U6 or miR-17-5p
or scrambled microRNA were added and hybridized at
550C for 1 hour. After stringent washes, an immunologic
reaction was carried out by using the biotinylated sheep
antibody against digoxingenin (Roche) and with alkaline
phosphatase streptavidin (Zhongshan Golden Bridge
Biotechnology Company) to detect biotinylated probes.
For immunohistochemistry, the paraffin sections
were incubated with primary antibody against PTEN
(1:100, CST, USA). For negative control, isotype-matched
antibodies were applied. Each slide was assigned a score
for density and intensity. Slides were mounted with
mounting medium and analyzed using a Leica DMI4000B
microscope. Each slide was assigned a score for intensity
and staining positive pattern.
The percentage of positive tumor cells was set as
follows: 1 (up to 25% of positive cells), 2 (25% to 50%
of positive cells), 3 (50% to 75% of positive cells) and 4
(more than 75% of positive cells). Intensity scores ranged
from 0-3: 0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate
staining, and 3, strong staining. Multiplication of the two
scores resulted in a final score ranging from 0 to 12. Under
these conditions, samples with score 0-6 and score 8-12
were defined as low and high expression.

Microarray
Total RNAs were extracted from tissues of six
primary colorectal cancer patients using the mirVana
miRNA extraction kit (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The quality control of RNA
was performed by a 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000
Pico LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
The microarray was performed at the Shanghai Biochip
Company by using the Agilent Human miRNA microarray
Kit version 12.0. Total RNA (100 ng) derived from each
of the specimens were used as inputs for labelling via Cy3
incorporation. Microarray slides were scanned by XDR
Scan (PMT100, PMT5). The labelling and hybridization
were performed according to the protocols in the Agilent
miRNA microarray system.

RNA isolation and quantification of miRNA by
qRT-PCR
RNA samples were isolated from harvested cells
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. miRNA expression was
quantified by two-step quantitative RT-PCR, beginning
with first-strand cDNA synthesis using the One-step
primeScript miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara),
followed by quantitative real-time PCR using the
miRscript SYBR Green PCR kit in a 7500 Real-Time
PCR system. The mature miRNA-specific forward primer
was purchased from Takara (DHM0136) and the universal
reverse primer was provided by the manufacturer. RNA
quantity was normalized using U6 snRNA, and fold
change of expression was calculated according to the 2-Δ
Δ ct
method.

Cell cultures
Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines
COLO205 (CCL-222) and SW480 (CCL-228) were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 U/
mL). Cells were allowed to grow in a humidified incubator
containing 5% CO2 at 370C and subcultured every 3-4
days.

Tissue Microarrays

Construct generation

The tissue microarray (TMA) was conducted using
paraffin-embedded tissues. In brief, the paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks and the corresponding histological H&E
stained slides were overlaid for tissue TMA sampling.
Duplicate of 0.6 mm diameter cylinders were punched
from representative tumor areas of individual donor tissue
block, and re-embedded into a recipient paraffin block

We generated a cDNA sequence which contains a
pair of human pre-miR-17 units, a CMV promoter driving
expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) and an H1
promoter. It was then inserted into an expression vector
pEGFP-N1 between the restriction sites BglII and HindIII.
Successful transfected cells were screened by using green

fluorescence and cultured in media with G418 at the
concentration of 1 mg/ml.
For luciferase assay, computational analysis
showed two potential binding sites for miR-17-5p in the
3’-untranslated region (3’UTR) of PTEN. Thus, two pairs
of primers were used to clone the fragments as well as
mutant controls. The PCR products were then digested
with SacI and MluI, followed by insertion into a SacI- and
MluI-digested pMir-Report vector (Ambion) to obtain
a luciferase construct or a mutant counterpart. In PTEN
rescue test, the PTEN cDNA with coding region was
purchased from Origene.

upper chamber of the transwell. The lower chamber was
filled with 600 μL DMEM media containing 10% FBS.
After incubation for 12 hours, non-migrated cells were
removed with cotton swab and invaded cells were stained
with Coomassie brilliant blue (Bio-Rad).

Western blot
In Western blot analysis, cell lysates were collected
from the cultured cells, which were subject to sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE). The proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad).
The membrane was then blocked in Tris-Buffered Saline
and Tween 20 (TBST: 10 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl
and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% skim milk powder
for 30 minutes. It was then incubated at 4overnight with
mouse monoclonal anti-PTEN antibody (Abcam). After
washing for 30 minutes, secondary goat anti-mouse
IgG (Vector) was applied to nitrocellulose membrane in
TBST for 1 hour. After washing for 1 hour, the proteins of
interest were visualized by using Chemiluminescent HRP
Antibody Detection Kit (Denville Scientific).

Real-time PCR analysis
For real-time PCR analysis, total cellular RNA
was extracted by using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit
(Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The cDNA products were synthesized by using 1 μg
RNA in successive reverse transcription PCR, which
was performed using miScript Reverse Transcription Kit
(Qiagen). The primers specific for mature miR-17-5p were
purchased from Qiagen and real-time PCR was performed
by using miScript SYBR GreenPCR Kit (Qiagen). The
primers used as controls for real-time PCR were HumanU6RNA.

Flow cytometry
For cell cycle analysis, cells in the logarithmic
phase of growth were harvested and washed twice in PBS.
Following adjustment of a cell concentration to 2x106
cells/mL in 50 µL PBS/HBSS with 2% calf serum, 1 mL
80% ice cold ethanol was added and incubated for 30
minutes. The cells were re-suspended in 500 µL HBSS
containing 0.1 mg/mL of Propidium Iodide (Sigma) and
0.6% of NP-40. The DNA content was measured by flow
cytometry (Beckman Coulter).
Cell apoptosis was detected by using Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen).
According to the manufacture’s instruction, 1x106
cells were washed twice in PBS before re-suspension
in 50 µL HBSS with 2% calf serum. Annexin V-FITC
and Propidium Iodide of 5 µL respectively were added
and stained on ice for 30 minutes. The cells were resuspended to 500 µL HBSS and flow cytometry analysis
was conducted within 30 minutes. The data were analyzed
using FlowJo9.1 software.

Cell activity tests
In cell proliferation assay, transfected COLO205 and
SW480 cells were plated onto 12-well tissue culture plates
at a density of 1x105 cells/well for 5 days. Meanwhile,
survival assay was performed by keeping the cells (1x106
cells/well) in serum-free medium for 10 days. The cells
were harvested and cell number was counted in different
time points.
To test drug sensitivity, fluorouracil (Valeant
Pharmaceuticals), eloxatin (Oxaliplatin) (Sanofi-Aventis)
and irinotecan (Pfizer) were applied to adhered cell
cultures. These drugs were purchased from the Pharmacy
Department at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. The
cell number was counted 12 hours after drug loading to
the cultures by Trypan Blue staining. They were also
subjected to apoptosis assay by flow cytometry.
For wound scratch assay, monolayer of cells was
scraped linearly with micropipette tips (BioMart) and
washed to remove cell debris. To diminish the impact of
proliferation, the cultures were treated with Mitomycin
C (Sigma) at 200 µg/mL for two hours beforehand.
Microscopic images were captured at the beginning, 24
hours and 48 hours intervals, and the migrated distance was
quantified. In the transwell invasion assay, 24-transwell
(Coster) was coated with 100 μL BD MatrigelTM (BD
Biosciences). COLO205 cells at a density of 1x105/100 μL
were suspended in DMEM media and transferred into the

Luciferase activity assay
Luciferase activity assays were performed as
previously described [16]. COLO205 and SW480 cells
were seeded onto 12-well tissue culture dishes at a
density of 1x105 cells/well and co-transfected with the
luciferase reporter constructs and miR-17-5p mimic
with Lipofectamine 2000. After 12 hours, cell lysate was
