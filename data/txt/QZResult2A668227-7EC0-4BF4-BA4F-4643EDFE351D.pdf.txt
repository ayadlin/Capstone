ABSTRACT
Androgen receptor (AR) mutations arise in patients developing resistance to
hormone deprivation therapies. Here we describe BAY 1024767, a thiohydantoin
derivative with strong antagonistic activity against nine AR variants with mutations
located in the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD), and against wild-type AR. Antagonism
was maintained, though reduced, at increased androgen levels. Anti-tumor efficacy
was evidenced in vivo in the KuCaP-1 prostate cancer model which bears the W741C
bicalutamide resistance mutation and in the syngeneic prostate cancer rat model
Dunning R3327-G. The prevalence of six selected AR mutations was determined in
plasma DNA originating from 100 resistant patients and found to be at least 12%.
Altogether the results show BAY 1024767 to be a strong antagonist for several AR
mutants linked to therapy resistance, which opens the door for next-generation
compounds that can benefit patients based on their mutation profile.

INTRODUCTION

antagonist enzalutamide [2, 4]. However, the development
of antagonists addressing the most important AR mutants
is compounded by the number of different variants
identified, and the limited and sometimes conflicting
information on their prevalence. Most AR mutations
identified in CRPC are located in the ligand-binding
domain (LBD) and alter the ligand-induced conformation
of this region so that coactivator recruitment is still
possible in the presence of antagonists, non-androgen
steroids or weak adrenal androgens [12, 13]. In addition,
different sets of downstream genes are controlled by AR
mutants, implying that ligand- and mutation-selective
conformations may take place [10, 14].
Conversion of antagonism to agonism in the
presence of different AR mutants has been observed
for approved AR antagonists. Cyproterone acetate,
hydroxyflutamide and nilutamide stimulate AR T877A,
the first AR mutation identified in prostate cancer
[15]. Hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide activate
the AR V715M mutant [16]. Bicalutamide, but not
hydroxyflutamide, becomes an agonist for the AR

Treatments targeting aberrant androgen receptor
(AR) signaling initially show impressive efficacy [1-5].
Unfortunately, therapy response usually only lasts for
about 18 months, after which castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) emerges. Several resistance mechanisms
centering on the AR have been evidenced: rise in androgen
supply by conversion of weak adrenal androgens into
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or by intratumoral de novo
synthesis, increase of AR expression and gene copy
number, mutations of AR leading to promiscuity and
response to non-androgen ligands, and occurrence of
splice variants with ligand-independent activity [6-9]. In
addition, a number of genomic alterations may arise in
the AR signaling pathway, which further underscores the
essential role of the androgen axis in CRPC [10, 11].
Elevated androgen levels and AR overexpression
can be addressed to some extent with AR antagonists
possessing higher activity for the target, as exemplified
by the recent approval of the second-generation AR

W741L and W741C mutants, due to the activation of an
androgenic-like programme [10], further confirming that
ligands with distinct chemical scaffolds have different
allosteric effects on receptor conformation [17]. The
E709Y mutant is strongly stimulated by bicalutamide,
but less so by hydroxyflutamide or nilutamide [18].
TThe AR mutation F876L, which leads to activation
by the recently approved enzalutamide and the related
ARN-509 compound, has been identified by an in vitro
selection procedure and an in vivo model selected for
growth in the presence of the antagonist [19-21]. This
mutation has already been detected in patients developing
resistance to ARN-509 or enzalutamide [22, 23]. The AR
H874Y mutant is stimulated by anti-androgens, adrenal
androgens and non-androgen steroids, leading to enhanced
coactivator recruitment [24, 25]. Several AR mutants not
stimulated by anti-androgens but activated by various
physiological steroids have also been found. For example,
AR L701H is stimulated by glucocorticoids, whose novel
interactions were revealed in modeling experiments [26].
Since this mutant shows little response to AR antagonists,
the broad activation by non-androgen steroids is probably
responsible for the tumor growth observed in prostate
models bearing this mutation [27]. The mutations L701H,
H874Y and T877A were also reported in patients with
resistance to the C17,20 lyase inhibitor abiraterone. This
may be due to previous treatment with AR antagonists or
to co-medication with glucocorticoids, which activate AR
mutants [20, 28].
In view of the persistent crucial role of the AR

in most CRPC patients, there is a high need for novel
antagonists addressing the adaptive mutations that emerge
following anti-hormone therapy. Here we describe BAY
1024767, a novel and potent competitive antagonist of
wild-type and mutated AR forms, and with potent in vivo
efficacy. The prevalence of selected AR mutations was
assessed in CRPC patients using the newly described
BEAMing (Beads, Emulsions, Amplification, and
Magnetics) technology to analyze circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA), and found to be at least 12%.

RESULTS
Identification of BAY 1024767
The synthesis of BAY 1024767 is described in
patent WO 2011/029537 (A1) as example 10. The
compound was discovered during a lead optimization
project aiming at identifying highly potent AR antagonists
with strong activity against wild-type and mutated AR
forms. The crystal structure of AR mutant W741L bound
to bicalutamide shows the influence of ligand shape
on helix 12 conformation [29]. We developed novel
antagonists that extend beyond the space occupied by the
fluorophenyl ring of bicalutamide in order to displace helix
12 into an antagonist conformation, even in AR forms with
an expanded ligand-binding pocket due to mutation. BAY
1024767 is a representative of the thiohydantoin type of
anti-androgens substantiating this hypothesis (Figure 1).

BAY 1024767 is a strong antagonist for wild-type
and mutated AR

all mutants tested and superior to the other anti-androgens
examined, with the exception of the T877A mutant (Figure
3B). Enzalutamide was a strong antagonist at low R1881
concentration, however lost most of its activity for both
wild-type and mutated AR when increasing the treatment
to 10 nM R1881 (Figure 3B). Bicalutamide displayed a
comparatively weak antagonism for AR wild-type in
presence of 0.1 nM R1881, which was rapidly lost when
increasing the stimulation to 1 or 10 nM R1881. Reduced
or no antagonism was observed for all mutants tested
especially at low R1881 concentrations. The novel clinical
AR antagonist ARN-509 was weaker than enzalutamide
but slightly stronger than bicalutamide. When comparing
the overall resistance of the AR mutants tested, it is clear
that T877A is the most challenging to address. Altogether
BAY 1024767 was the only anti-androgen tested which
displayed antagonism for all AR mutants and retained
activity at elevated androgen stimulation.

Binding of BAY 1024767 to human wild-type
AR was determined in a competitive assay and found
to be 450 nM. Target engagement was verified in VCaP
(AR wild-type) and LNCaP (AR T877A mutant) cells
treated with R1881 (Figure 2A and 2B). Comparable
dose-dependent down-regulations of PSA and FKBP5
were observed following BAY 1024767 application. In
light of AR alterations previously described in CRPC
patients, the following nine mutations were chosen for
testing: L701H, E709Y, V715M, W741C, H874Y, F876L,
T877A, M895T and M895V. PC-3 cells were transfected
with plasmids harboring each mutation and an MMTVcontrolled luciferase reporter. The levels of transfected
AR mutants were comparable and in the same range as
endogenous AR in LNCaP cells, when measured by ELISA
(Supplementary Figure S1). The synthetic androgen R1881
stimulated AR wild-type and most mutants similarly, with
however weaker responses of the L701H, W741C, M895T
and M895V forms (Figure 3A). No dose-dependent
agonistic activity was observed with BAY 1024767 for
any of the mutants tested (Figure 3A). Enzalutamide did
not stimulate the mutants tested, with the remarkable
exception of F876L, reaching nearly 40% of the R1881
activity at the highest concentration used (Figure 3A),
as previously described [19, 21, 23]. In sharp contrast,
bicalutamide did not activate F876L, but did stimulate
several of the other mutants already at low concentrations,
reaching almost the activity seen with 1 nM R1881 at
elevated levels in the case of W741C and M895T. Less
but still significant stimulation was observed for E709Y
and M895V. No stimulatory effect of bicalutamide was
detected for the 5 other mutants tested (Figure 3A). Next,
the antagonistic activity of the compounds was compared
using different R1881 concentrations for stimulation
(Figure 3B). BAY 1024767 was a strong antagonist for

BAY 1024767 promotes AR nuclear localization
Immunofluorescence studies using a FITC-labeled
AR antibody were performed in transfected COS-7
cells treated with compounds for 4 h. AR wild-type and
the mutants E709Y, V715M, W741C and H874Y were
distributed in the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand but
concentrated in the nucleus following R1881 treatment
(Figure 4A and 4B). BAY 1024767 promoted nuclear
localization of AR wild-type and mutants in the absence
of R1881 with little residual cytoplasmic signal remaining
upon antagonistic treatment alone, and did not prevent
nuclear translocation in the presence of R1881. The results
were similar following treatment with enzalutamide,
however the translocation effects were slightly less
pronounced, possibly due to weaker target engagement.
Similar results were observed with endogenous AR in
VCaP cells (Figure 4C).

In vitro anti-proliferative activity of BAY 1024767

BAY 1024767 releases AR from the PSA gene
enhancer region

The efficacy of BAY 1024767 was determined
in different prostate cancer cell lines representative of
clinically relevant resistance mechanisms (Figure 5A). In
LAPC-4 cells which express AR wild-type, BAY 1024767
was superior to enzalutamide and to bicalutamide. In
VCaP cells which contain 4- to 5-fold more AR protein
than other prostate cancer cell lines (Figure 5B), BAY
1024767 was more effective at inhibiting cell proliferation
than bicalutamide and enzalutamide. In LNCaP and
22Rv1 cells, containing mutated and/or splice variants
of the AR, BAY 1024767 and enzalutamide had a
comparable anti-proliferative effect, much stronger than
that of bicalutamide. No anti-proliferative activity was
observed when treating the AR-negative PC-3 cell line
(Supplementary Figure S2).

Given that BAY 1024767 antagonized R1881stimulated gene transcription but was not capable of
preventing the translocation of AR into the nucleus,
its mode of action was investigated at the chromatinbinding level in VCaP cells. AR binding to PSA gene
regulatory elements is well characterized [30]. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed AR binding after
agonist treatment to be mostly at the PSA enhancer
region, but not at the middle region or at the promoter.
The strong AR binding to the PSA enhancer was entirely
prevented by BAY 1024767, but not by enzalutamide
(Figure 4D). No significant changes were observed at
the middle or promoter region of the PSA gene, however
a slight increase of bound AR was observed after
enzalutamide treatment, compared to the control or to
BAY 1024767-treated samples.

mg/kg daily and enzalutamide dosed at 160 mg/kg daily

The pharmacokinetic properties of BAY 1024767
are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Low hepatic
clearance was measured in liver microsomes from different
species including humans. The cell permeability was high
and no efflux was observed. In vivo pharmacokinetic
studies in male NMRI mice revealed a low clearance
and a high oral bioavailability, thereby supporting oral
administration as the application route for in vivo studies.
After multiple oral doses of 50 mg/kg every second day to
male SCID mice, unbound plasma concentrations of BAY
1024767 remained over the unbound anti-proliferative

(maximal tolerated dose) showed strong efficacy, and
tumor volume remained almost constant, near the levels
of the group treated by castration (Figure 6A). In sharp
contrast, bicalutamide (60 mg/kg/day) did not affect tumor
growth. Tumor weight measured at the end of the study
confirmed the efficacy of BAY 1024767 (36% T/C on day
54 post-tumor implantation, significant difference (p <
0.05) versus control group), whereas bicalutamide tended
to stimulate tumor growth (147% T/C) (Figure 6B), as
previously described [31]. Treatments were well tolerated
with mean body weight losses similar (bicalutamide)
or inferior (BAY 1024767) to that of the control group,
and mostly related to the tumor burden (Supplementary
Figure S4). BAY 1024767 strongly reduced serum PSA
levels (1.3 ng/ml, compared to 7.1 ng/ml in the control
group (Figure 6C)). In contrast, bicalutamide treatment
led to a 3-fold increase of serum PSA (21.3 ng/ml) when
compared to the non-treated group. In a different study
using the same tumor model, enzalutamide was compared
to bicalutamide (Supplementary Figure S5). Enzalutamide,
applied orally daily at 100 mg/kg was inactive (with 100%

T/C calculated on tumor weights on day 52 post-tumor
implantation). As previously, bicalutamide (100 mg/kg,
orally, daily) was inactive with 112% T/C.
We additionally determined the in vivo efficacy of
BAY 1024767 in the syngeneic Dunning rat R3327-G
prostate cancer model [32]. Rats with subcutaneous
implantation of tumor pieces were treated daily with
oral doses of 40 mg/kg BAY 1024767, once the tumor
reached 50 mm3. Comparison of tumor volumes showed
a significant anti-tumor efficacy of BAY 1024767 (Figure
7A). This was also reflected at the level of tumor weights
measured at the end of the study (11% T/C at day 113
post-tumor implantation, significant difference (p <
0.05) versus vehicle group (Figure 7B)). In addition,
strong inhibition of seminal vesicle weight was observed
following treatment with BAY 1024767, comparable to
that seen in the castrated group (p < 0.05 versus vehicle
group, data not shown). No significant body weight loss
was observed, showing that treatment with BAY 1024767
at an efficacious dose was well tolerated in rats as well.

mutations were designed and in each case only one
possible nucleotide change was selected, based on
previously published information (Supplementary Table

CRPC patients had at least one out of the six investigated

various in vitro transactivation assays using mutated AR
forms. In vivo, we observed very strong activity in the
KuCaP-1 model which bears the comparatively frequent
W741C AR mutation. Importantly, the compound also
strongly impaired AR binding to the regulatory enhancer
region of the PSA gene while reducing PSA serum levels
in tumor-bearing mice, which is routinely used as a
pharmacodynamic marker in the clinic. The efficacy of
BAY 1024767 was further evidenced in the syngeneic
Dunning R3327-G rat model with high AR expression
where a significant anti-tumor effect was observed.
In addition, a dramatic reduction of seminal vesicle
weight, comparable to that seen in castrated animals, was
evidenced.
AR mutations identified in CRPC patients usually
do not merely lead to loss of interaction with antagonists
but rather represent gain-of-function alterations. The
mutations identified in ctDNA are likely to represent
drivers of acquired resistance and among them T877A
was the most frequent. This was unexpected since this
mutation was originally identified in a patient treated
with hydroxyflutamide [38], which is now rarely used for
treatment. The recent finding that progesterone stimulates
this mutant and is synthesized by the tumor may
explain why this position is a mutation hotspot [39, 40].
Bicalutamide exhibits antagonism for the T877A mutant,
which can be explained by the different positioning of AR
LBD helix 12 [29]. Nonetheless, we found bicalutamide
to be a weaker antagonist for this mutant in comparison
to AR wild-type following stimulation with 0.1 nM
androgen, and to lose most of its antagonistic activity at
higher androgen levels. Indeed, loss of antagonism for
the AR T877A mutant was seen for all compounds tested,
but BAY 1024767 and enzalutamide maintained the best
profile. This was mirrored in the proliferation assays with
the LNCaP cell line, which harbors the T877A mutation,
where BAY 1024767 and enzalutamide were also more
efficacious than bicalutamide. The data underline that
this position is key in the switch between an inactive and
active AR conformation necessary for recruitment of coactivators and binding to target genes.

tumor heterogeneity. Interestingly, the T877A mutation
was observed most frequently, accounting for five out
of 14 cases in twelve different patients. Mutations at
positions V715, W741 and H874 were each observed
three times. The mutation frequency varied significantly
among samples and was in several cases below 0.1%. In
patient 5 however, a very high frequency of the T877A
mutation was observed. These ratios should however be
interpreted with caution since the amount of contaminating
lymphocyte DNA may vary in each sample. Nonetheless
the very high frequency and the fact that it was found
in four additional patients underscore the importance of
the T877A mutation in the acquisition of resistance to
hormonal treatment in prostate cancer. It should also be
noted that all the mutation frequencies determined may
represent an underestimation since other DNA point
mutations leading to the same amino acid exchange are
possible but would not have been detected by the primers
used in this study.

DISCUSSION
Resistance mechanisms described in CRPC mostly
concern the AR pathway so that the identification of novel
anti-androgens with improved properties remains an
essential research focus in this field [3-5]. Indeed several
new AR antagonists have moved to the clinical stage in
recent years, raising the hope that new therapy options will
be available soon [35-37].
BAY 1024767 is a novel competitive AR antagonist
that exhibits strong activity against AR wild-type and
mutated forms found in therapy-resistant patients, keeps
antagonistic activity with increased androgen stimulation
and in prostate cancer models with elevated AR protein
levels. It also shows anti-proliferative activity in a model
expressing splice variants. Its potent antagonism when
androgen or AR levels are high is most probably due to
strong target engagement whereas its activity towards
mutants may be linked to its extended structure that
presumably displaces helix 12 towards an antagonist
position. The efficacy of BAY 1024767 was evidenced in

The occurrence of AR splice variants in CRPC
patients has been reported [9, 41]. Many have lost their
LBD and can therefore not be directly addressed by a
competitive antagonist. However splice variants may
form heterodimers with full-length AR wild-type, which
are still blocked by anti-androgens [42, 43], and it will
be interesting to find out whether this is also the case for
heterodimers formed with AR LBD mutants.
The 12% frequency rate measured in our study for
AR mutations is probably an underestimation. Firstly,
despite the very high sensitivity of the BEAMing
method, some of the interrogated mutations may have
gone undetected, as the plasma preparations used in
our study had not been optimized for enrichment of
ctDNA. Secondly, for each selected position only one
specific primer sequence was used to analyze the plasma
DNA samples even though additional options existed in
most cases. Thirdly, additional AR LBD mutations not
addressed in this study have been identified recently,
including F876L which was detected in 3 out of 27 patients
treated with the novel AR antagonist ARN-509 [23]. In a
very recent study on ctDNA from 62 patients progressing
on enzalutamide or abiraterone, the AR mutation rate was
found to be 18% by targeted next-generation sequencing of
exon 8, which covers the C-terminal part of the LBD [22].
As in our study, the H874Y and T877A mutations were
found several times. In addition, the M895V substitution
was detected once, underlining the importance of having
a compound such as BAY 1024767 for blockade of this
AR mutant which was originally identified in a primary
prostate tumor [44]. A sequencing approach was also
used in another study focusing on circulating tumor cells
(CTCs) from CRPC patients [45]. Here, 35 CTC samples
were analyzed and 19 AR missense mutations identified in
15 patients. These mutations include several positions that
we detected, and again M895V. Such unbiased sequencing
approaches have the potential to identify all AR mutations
arising in refractory prostate cancer patients provided the
complete coding region is analyzed, but are unlikely to be
used routinely in the near future. Also, they necessitate
the isolation of CTCs, which is more cumbersome than
purification of plasma DNA, and cannot be used in
patients with low or no CTC counts.
Precise determination of the respective prevalence
of individual AR mutations and their variation along
treatment duration should now be more readily feasible
using blood-based assays and the BEAMing technology
described here, compared to analysis of CTCs which is not
yet routinely established in the clinic, or of tumor biopsies
which is challenging, especially in the case of metastases.
Such approaches will deliver essential information for
guiding the future treatment of CRPC, which is multifocal
in nature and will necessitate bespoke drugs addressing
both wild-type and mutated AR, while keeping efficacy in
the presence of high androgen levels and at elevated AR
expression.

In summary, we have identified BAY 1024767,
a novel AR antagonist which addresses three essential
mechanisms responsible for CRPC. This may offer new
therapy options by overcoming and/or delaying resistance,
either by treating patients who do not respond or who
are stimulated by approved anti-hormonal agents, or by
sequential use of AR antagonists with different profiles.

Cell culture and materials
All anti-androgen compounds were synthesized
in-house and are shown in Figure 1. The cell lines were
obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) or DSMZ
(Braunschweig, Germany) and authenticated at the DSMZ
by short tandem repeat DNA typing. The KuCaP-1 patientderived model [46] was from Prof. O. Ogawa, University
of Kyoto, Japan. The Dunning R3327-G rat prostatic tumor
[47] and the AR expression plasmid [48] were described
before. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the
appropriate primer pairs and the QuickChange II XL SiteDirected Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA).

Binding and transient transfection assays
Competitive binding to recombinant human AR
was determined in presence of 5 nM tritiated R1881.
PC-3 transfection and determination of luciferase activity
were performed as before [49]. The test compounds were
added with 0.1% ethanol (agonistic mode) or the indicated
R1881 concentrations (antagonistic mode). The average
value of six wells treated in parallel was taken. The
experiments were repeated at least twice independently.
The NR Sandwich AR ELISA 49696 (Active Motif,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to determine endogenous
AR levels and compare the levels of expressed AR protein
in transfected PC-3 cells.

mRNA expression assays
VCaP or LNCaP cells were seeded into 6-well plates
in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red, supplemented
with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (cFCS) and 2
mM stable glutamine, and maintained for 2 days prior to
treatment. R1881 (or ethanol control) was added to cells
at 1 nM end concentration simultaneously with DMSO,
or the AR antagonist BAY 1024767 at the indicated
concentrations. After 24 h treatment, total RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) and reverse-transcription was performed using
the SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for
6023

Oncotarget

qRT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Germany). Transcript
levels of AR target genes were determined by real-time
PCR using the following assays (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA): PSA Hs02576345_m1 and
FKBP5 Hs00188025_m1. Human PPIA (Cyclophilin A)
4326316E was used as an internal control.

20 µL of magnetic Protein A bead suspension. 2 µg of
antibodies anti-AR (sc-815-x; Santa Cruz) and rabbit IgG
(Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) were used per
immunoprecipitation. The buffers used were: bead wash
(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02 % Tween-20),
wash 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 % Triton X-100, 0.1 % SDS), wash 2 (20 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1 % Triton
X-100, 0.1 % SDS), wash 3 (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1
mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 1 % Nonidet P40, 1 % sodium
deoxycholate) and elute (0.1 M NaHCO3, 1 % SDS).
Reverse cross-linking of immunoprecipitation
elutions and inputs was done for 16 h at 65°C, with 160
µM NaCl final concentration. The samples were treated
with RNaseA and Proteinase K, and were purified using
the Qiagen PCR purification kit before analysis by qPCR.
The primers used were for the prostate specific
antigen (PSA) gene [30, 50]: promoter forward CCT AGA
TGA AGT CTC CAT GAG CTA CA; promoter reverse
GGG AGG GAG AGC TAG CAC TTG; enhancer forward
GCC TGG ATC TGA GAG AGA TAT CAT C; enhancer

Immunofluorescence
COS-7 cells were grown to 60% confluence and then
incubated in phenol red-free DMEM medium containing
10% cFCS. After two days, cells were transfected with AR
expression plasmids (1.25 ng) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) for 20 h, then were treated for 4 h with 1 nM
R1881 or ethanol along with DMSO, 1 µM BAY 1024767
or 5 µM enzalutamide.
VCaP cells were grown to 30% confluence and then
incubated in phenol red-free DMEM medium containing
carbon-filtered FCS (DMEM-cFCS) for 3 days. The cells
were treated for 6 h with 1 nM R1881 or ethanol along
with DMSO, 5 µM BAY 1024767 or 5 µM enzalutamide.
For staining, culture medium was removed and the
cells were washed three times with PBS. The cells were
then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min
at room temperature, washed, permeabilized with PBS
containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed again,
treated with blocking solution (1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20
in PBS) for 30 min, and incubated overnight at 37°C
in blocking solution in the presence of anti-AR-FITC
antibody (sc-815-FITC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX, USA). The cells were then washed, stained with 300
nM DAPI in PBS for 5 min, and sealed with a coverslip.
Cells were imaged on an LSM700 confocal laser scanning
microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany), using a 25X
objective. Quantification of COS-7 cells was performed
on 25 cells in two replicates using ImageJ software.

Cell proliferation assays
All assays were performed in 96-well microtiter
plates. Cells were grown in RPMI-1640 media without
phenol red and supplemented with 10% cFCS and 2 mM
L-glutamine. LAPC-4 cells were plated at 4,000 cells/well,
VCaP cells at 16,000 cells/well, LNCaP cells at 2,000
cells/well, 22Rv1 cells at 4,000 cells/well. After 1 day, the
cells were treated with R1881 (0.1 nM final concentration,
except for LAPC-4 where the final concentration was 1
nM) and compound (day 0). Cell number was determined
by Alamar Blue staining (2 h). Fluorescence was measured
in a Victor3 device (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA)
with the excitation filter set at 530 nm and the emission
filter set at 590 nm. C0 was defined as the signal measured
at day 7 for cells treated only with R1881 and CI was
defined as the signal measured at day 7 for cells grown
without R1881 or compound.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
VCaP cells were grown in 10 cm plates to
80% confluence. One plate of cells was used per
immunoprecipitation. The cells were maintained in
DMEM-cFCS for 3 days prior to treatment. R1881 (or
ethanol control) was added to cells at 1 nM simultaneously
with DMSO, or the AR antagonists BAY 1024767 or
enzalutamide at 5 µM. After 6 h treatment, the cells
were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 8 min,
quenched in 125 mM glycine, washed 3 times with PBS,
and frozen. After cell lysis (5 mM PIPES pH 8, 85 mM
KCl, 0.5 % Nonidet P40) and nuclei isolation using RIPA
buffer, chromatin was sheared to 100-2000 base pair-long
fragments using a S220 ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn,
MA, USA).
Immunoprecipitations were performed using
the IPstar device (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium) with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Metabolic stability in vitro
The metabolic stability of BAY 1024767
was determined by incubating the compound with
suspensions of liver microsomes from different species
at a concentration of 1 µM. The intrinsic clearance was
calculated from the half-life of the compound. Together
with additional parameters like microsomal protein
content, species-specific liver weight and liver blood flow,
the hepatic in vivo blood clearance (CLH) was calculated.

Caco-2 permeation assay

Efficacy was evaluated according to the National Cancer
Institute standards (%T/C ≤ 42% = active). Statistical
analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) on ranks using Dunn’s method. The
Quantikine® Human Kallikrein 3/PSA Immunoassay
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to
measure mouse serum PSA levels at the end of the study.
Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney
rank sum test.
The Dunning R3327-G tumor [51] was maintained
by serial in vivo passages. For the efficacy experiment,
tumor tissue pieces of 8 mm3 were inoculated
subcutaneously (flank region) in 12-13 week-old male
Copenhagen rats (COP/CrCrl strain, Charles River
Laboratories). Treatment was started once the tumor
reached 50 mm2 and rats were randomly assigned to
control (n = 9), castrated (n = 10) or treatment group (n
= 10). In the treatment group 40 mg/kg of BAY 1024767
was given orally once a day (p.o., QD). The vehicle was
NMP/PEG 1/9 (v/v). Rat body weight was measured
at least twice a week. Tumor volume and weight were
determined as above.

Caco-2 cells were seeded on 24-well insert plates,
0.4 µm pore size, and grown for 15 days. The test
compound was dissolved in DMSO and added either to
the apical (A) or basolateral (B) compartment at a final
concentration of 2 µM. Before and after 2 h incubation,
samples were taken from both compartments and analyzed
by LC/MS/MS. The apparent permeability (Papp) was
determined for each direction and the efflux ratio was
calculated as Papp B-A/Papp A-B.

In vivo pharmacokinetics in mice
BAY 1024767 was administered to 6-7 week-old
male NMRI mice in the tail vein by a single dose of
0.5 mg/kg and intragastral by a single dose of 1 mg/kg
formulated in PEG400/water (60/40). Three mice were
sacrificed at different time points after dosing, and blood
(for heparinized plasma) was sampled from the vena cava.
Analysis of the samples was performed by LC/MS/MS
and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis.

AR mutation frequency

In vivo efficacy studies

All patients received written information about
the planned AR mutation analysis performed on serum
samples and signed a document indicating their informed
consent. Blood plasma was collected and prepared from
CRPC patients under standardized clinical laboratory
practices. A total of 100 patients of which 98 had received
at least two different hormonal treatments and with a
median time to CRPC status of 8 years (range 1-20 years)
were analyzed. Seventy-seven of these patients had bone
metastases, 59 had visceral metastases and 49 had both.
Blood plasma (2 ml) obtained from each patient was
collected in EDTA tubes, mixed gently and centrifuged
at 4 °C for 10 min at 3400 g. It was then transferred by
pipetting into 15 ml conical tubes which were centrifuged
at 4 °C for 15 min at 1500 g. The cell-free plasma was
then transferred into storage tubes and kept at -80 °C. The
BEAMing experiments [52] were performed on cell-free
plasma DNA by Sysmex Inostics (Hamburg, Germany).
For the analysis, cell-free plasma DNA was first preamplified in a multiplex PCR reaction, amplified with
nested primers and normalized. Emulsion PCR was then
performed on the surface of magnetic beads in waterin-oil emulsions. Following destruction of the emulsion
structure, the uncovered DNA fragments were hybridized
to fluorescent probes specific to the mutations. These
labeled beads were then quantified by flow cytometry.
Statistical analysis was performed as described previously
[53].

Animal experiments were approved by the relevant
regulatory agency of the federal state of Berlin (Landesamt
für Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin). Animals were housed
according to institutional guidelines with access to food
(pelleted diet) and water ad libitum. The KuCaP-1 patientderived tumor model was maintained by serial passage
in SCID/CB17 male mice. The presence of the W741C
mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing (not shown).
For the efficacy studies, 11-12 week-old SCID/CB17 male
mice (Charles River Laboratories, Erkrath, Germany)
were inoculated subcutaneously with tumor fragments into
the right flank. Tumors were allowed to grow and mice
were randomly assigned to control or treatment groups
with a mean tumor volume of 100 mm3 (n = 10-12 mice/
group). Mice received vehicle, BAY 1024767 (50 mg/kg
every 2 days [Q2D]), enzalutamide (100 mg/kg once daily
[QD]) or bicalutamide (60 or 100 mg/kg once daily [QD])
orally for 18-21 days, depending on the study. The doses
used were either the maximal tolerated dose or the dose
reaching maximal exposure in mice. Compounds were
solubilized in NMP/PEG300 1/9 (v/v). An additional
group included mice castrated at the start of the study that
received vehicle. Mouse body weight was determined at
least twice a week. Tumors were measured twice a week
using a caliper (tumor volume (mm3) = [length (mm)
x width2 (mm2)]/2). Tumor/control ratio (T/C) % was
calculated as [mean tumor weight in the treated group/
mean tumor weight in the control vehicle group]×100).
