BACKGROUND: In premenopausal women treated for breast cancer, loss of bone mineral density (BMD) follows from menopause
induced by chemotherapy or loss of ovarian function biochemically or by surgical oophorectomy. The impact on BMD of surgical
oophorectomy plus tamoxifen therapy has not been described. METHODS: In 270 Filipino and Vietnamese premenopausal patients
participating in a clinical trial assessing the impact of the timing in the menstrual cycle of adjuvant surgical oophorectomy on breast
cancer outcomes, BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck before this treatment, and at 6, 12, and 24 months after
surgical and tamoxifen therapies. RESULTS: In women with a pretreatment BMD assessment and at least 1 other subsequent BMD
assessment, no significant change in femoral neck BMD was observed over the 2-year period (20.006 g/cm2, 20.8%, P 5.19), whereas
in the lumbar spine, BMD fell by 0.045 g/cm2 (4.7%) in the first 12 months (P <.0001) and then began to stabilize. CONCLUSIONS:
Surgically induced menopause with tamoxifen treatment is associated with loss of BMD at a rate that lessens over 2 years in the lumC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
In high-income countries, premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive tumors account for 15% of the case
burden in breast cancer; however, in low- and middle-income countries this percentage is approximately 36%.1 Globally,
one-third of the case burden in breast cancer is in this group. With increasingly effective therapies and the associated
increases in long-term survival, the total “costs” of therapies are of concern to afflicted women.
Adjuvant ovarian ablation improves survival in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer unselected for
hormonal receptor status.2 Meta-analysis data also suggest a trend favoring ovarian ablation over luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist treatment.2 Adjuvant surgical oophorectomy plus tamoxifen improves survival with
risk reduction of 0.54 in hormone receptor positive patients.3 A variety of direct but underpowered studies and indirect
risk reduction data suggest that this combined hormonal adjuvant treatment may modestly improve results over oophorectomy or tamoxifen alone.4-8 The direct adjuvant comparison of tamoxifen with or without ovarian ablation or ovarian
function suppression is being tested in the SOFT trial, in which, however, the fraction of women treated with surgical
oophorectomy may be too small to allow conclusions about this specific combined hormonal treatment. In this context,
in high-income countries, many premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive tumors are treated with chemotherapy and tamoxifen, because of the conclusion that current chemotherapy regimens, particularly with taxanes, provide
greater benefits than any hormonal therapies.9 In low- and middle-income countries, however, where alkylating agentanthracycline combinations are the standard, surgical oophorectomy plus tamoxifen and chemotherapy plus LHRH plus
tamoxifen provide comparable breast cancer outcome benefits.3,5
Losses of BMD are important because gains are difficult to achieve, and depending on the maximal levels of BMD
women achieve and the rates of loss, losses can rapidly lead to absolute BMD levels associated with markedly greater

fracture risk.10 Loss of ovarian function is associated with
loss of BMD. Because this occurs gradually, annual rates
of loss of BMD vary “at menopause” but absolute loss of
5% to 10% of BMD in 5 years after menopause is common in normal women.11 Tamoxifen alone preserves
BMD in postmenopausal women12-14 ; however, in premenopausal women treated with tamoxifen alone, Powles
et al found loss of BMD (2.88% over 2 years); other data
support this conclusion.13,15 Studies evaluating BMD
changes associated with LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen
and chemotherapy plus tamoxifen treatments have all
demonstrated losses in BMD.15-20
In these contexts, we report here findings from longitudinal assessments of BMD at the lumbar spine (L1L4) and femoral neck in 270 premenopausal Filipino and
Vietnamese women with hormone receptor-positive
breast cancer participating in a clinical trial assessing the
impact of the timing in the menstrual cycle of surgical
oophorectomy on breast cancer outcomes. All women in
the trial also underwent treatment with tamoxifen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This report is of an ancillary study to a randomized phase
3 clinical trial investigating the impact of the timing of adjuvant surgical oophorectomy. Women with core biopsy
hormone receptor-positive invasive breast cancer were
stratified at registration according to likelihood of not
being (stratum 1) or being (stratum 2) in the luteal phase
of the menstrual cycle during the next 1 to 6 days. Patients
in stratum 1 were randomized to (delayed) surgical
oophorectomy during the estimated mid-luteal phase of
the menstrual cycle or to immediate surgical oophorectomy. Patients in stratum 2 were assigned immediate surgical oophorectomy. All patients underwent surgical
oophorectomy and mastectomy surgeries in that sequence
under the same anesthesia on the same day according to
the randomized or direct day-of-surgery assignments. All
patients began on tamoxifen within 6 days of their surgeries. Patient written informed consent that included
monitoring with BMD assessments was required. The
study was approved at individual participating institutions
in the Philippines and Vietnam, and by supervising institutional review boards for these institutions and at the
lead investigators’ US institutions. All of the participating
institutions and institutional review boards were registered with the Office for Human Research Protections in
the United States. A total of 740 patients were enrolled in
the parent trial. Eligibility criteria for the parent study
included age  18 years,  50 years; history of menstrual
cycles for the last 3 months of  25 to  35 days and last

and or progesterone receptor-positive by immunohistochemistry) breast cancer; clinical stage II-IIIB; physical examination including
gynecological examination
unrevealing for any suggestion of serious illness or metastatic breast cancer; negative chest X-ray; and negative
urine pregnancy test. According to the stratification and
randomization schema of the parent study, of the ancillary
study patients, 175 stratum 1 patients were randomized to
either immediate surgical oophorectomy or to having this
procedure delayed until the estimated next mid-luteal
phase of their menstrual cycles; the remaining 95 stratum
2 patients underwent, by direct assignment, immediate
surgical oophorectomy. This distribution of randomized
or assigned treatment times was similar to the full set of
patients who entered the parent trial. All patients in the
parent trial were begun on tamoxifen 20 mg daily within
6 days of oophorectomy surgery, to be continued for 5
years (tamoxifen [Nolvadex] was provided by AstraZeneca
Pharmaceutical, London, UK). Patients returned at 3- to
4-month intervals for tamoxifen medication and symptom and physical examination reevaluations. Because of
this requirement, compliance with tamoxifen administration is thought to be high.
Statistical Analyses

A nonlinear mixed effects regression model was used to
assess the change in BMD over the study period. The
form was adapted from a simple exponential trend
described in Stevens,21 which allows the outcome to
approach an asymptote as time increases. Specifically,

yijk ¼ ai 1uij 1bexpðgxijk Þ1eijk
where yijk represents the BMD measurement for kth observation on the jth subject from ith site, x represents the time
from enrollment, and e the residual error. The model
includes 3 fixed-effect parameters: the site-specific asymptote (ai), the change from baseline to the asymptote (b),
and a rate parameter (g) that determines how quickly the
asymptote is approached over time, and a random intercept (uij) assumed to be normally distributed with mean
zero and variance ru2. The random intercept adequately
modeled the dependency among observations obtained
from each woman. Other random coefficients (eg, rate of
decline) were also tested. In addition, a site-specific asymptote parameter was included to account for absolute
BMD differences at both the lumbar spine and femoral

neck sites found between Vietnamese and Filipino patient
populations. The difference was surmised to be at least
partially due to different equipment and software analytic
programs. The relationships between age, weight, and
body mass index (BMI) and BMD were also explored
RESULTS
The late date of initiation of this ancillary study, site nonparticipation (because of unavailability of BMD assessment equipment), BMD measurements for individual
patients done at different sites with different equipment,
equipment breakdown, absence of baseline BMD assessment, or other logistical issues all unrelated to individual
patient bone health led to creation of a study sample with
baseline BMD assessments (taken within 1 month of randomization on study) in 332 patients. Of these, 270
patients subsequently had at least one BMD measurement
taken within 30 months of randomization using the same
equipment.
Table 1 presents the characteristics of the 270 studied patients; Table 2 gives the details of the number and
time period of follow-up visits completed by the patients.
Figure 1 shows the lumbar spine BMD traces for 30
randomly selected patients. A decrease in BMD was
observed following the intervention, with the rate of the
decline lessening over time (Fig. 2). The nonlinear model
appeared to fit the data well and all parameters were sig-

nificant (Table 3). The site-specific asymptote parameters
(aV and aF) in the model indicated Vietnamese patients
had 0.214 g/cm2 higher lumbar spine measurements on
average than Filipino patients (P value for difference
< .0001). The estimated within-patient variance (re2)
was 0.0018 and the between-patient (intercept) variance
(ru2) was 0.0116, which means that 85% of the total variation in the data was due to variance among patients in
level of BMD. An additional random effect for the rate
parameter was added to the model, but was not significant, indicating little evidence for a varying rate of decline

among patients (ie, only variance for the location of the
asymptote was significant). An additional parameter
allowing for a site-specific rate parameter was not significant (P 5 .16), indicating no evidence for a difference in
the rate by site. Table 4 presents the model-derived estimates for change in BMD at the 6-, 12-, and 24-month
time points. As shown in Figure 2, BMD decreases most
rapidly in the first 12 months after baseline/treatment
initiation.
For femoral neck BMD, there was no clear change
in BMD following the intervention (Fig. 3). Estimates
from the nonlinear model were somewhat unstable due to
the flat nature of the relationship between BMD and
time, but consistently demonstrated a lack of significance
for the change and rate parameters of the model. The difference in the site-specific asymptote parameters was significant (P < .0001) and indicated 0.208 g/cm2 higher
femoral neck measurements for Vietnamese patients, on
average. The estimated within-patient variance was
0.0015 compared with 0.0079 for the between-patient
(asymptote) variance, again roughly 85% of the total. A
fixed effect for site for the rate parameter was not significant (P 5 .22), indicating no evidence for a difference in
the rate by site. The estimated changes from baseline presented in Table 4 are small, and the 95% confidence intervals are narrow, indicating no evidence for a clinically
meaningful change over the study time period. A simple

linear mixed model with site and time as the fixed effects
gave very similar results.
Changes in BMD by patient age, weight, and BMI
were explored. No impact was observed on the rate of
decline by age (< 43 years versus  43 years) for either anatomic site, but patients aged 43 years or older exhibited
0.030 g/cm2 lower baseline femoral neck BMD on average
than those under 43 years. No difference by age group was
observed in baseline lumbar BMD. No changes in the rates
of decline in BMD were observed by weight or BMI. However, clear positive relationships between weight and BMI
and baseline BMD were observed. The BMI correlations
with BMD were similar in Vietnamese and Filipino patients
both for lumbar (r 5 0.32, P 5 .0029 and r 5 0.38,
P < .0001, respectively) and femoral neck (r 5 0.33,
P 5 .0011 and r 5 0.32, P < .0001, respectively).
DISCUSSION
The results presented here are from the largest study
reported to date of BMD changes over time after adjuvant

therapy for premenopausal breast cancer. We found compelling evidence in longitudinal data in 270 patients that
surgical oophorectomy followed by immediate tamoxifen
treatment is associated with loss of BMD at the lumbar
spine, the rate of which declines over 2 years and no significant change in BMD in the femoral neck. Sverrisdottir et
al reported on 14 patients treated with LHRH plus tamoxifen 40 mg and 13 patients treated with LHRH alone.
At 2 years, in the patients treated with LHRH plus tamoxifen, total body BMD had decreased by 1.4% (0.015 g/
cm2) and 5.0% in the patients treated with LHRH alone.
In this study, total body BMD was correlated with lumbar
spine BMD (r 5 0.8).15 Gnant et al studied 82 patients,
who were treated with LHRH plus tamoxifen, 26 of
whom also had 3-year BMD assessments; baseline lumbosacral spine BMD was 1.028 g/cm2 at baseline and at 36
months had decreased by 0.072 g/cm2, of 9.0% observed
or estimated 7.2% (from a model considering missing
data); trochanter BMD was 0.715 g/cm2 at baseline with
losses of 5.1% observed and estimated of 2.9%; In both
sites, the BMD loss stabilized after 24 months.16 Similar
BMD losses have been consistently reported in premenopausal populations treated with chemotherapy and tamoxifen. Shapiro et al studied 35 women, 9 of whom
received tamoxifen; lumbar spine BMD, which was 0.999
g/cm2 before treatment, fell 7.7% in 1 year; femoral neck
BMD, which was 0.782 g/cm2 before treatment, fell
4.6%.17 Powles et al, evaluating 118 patients, most also
treated with tamoxifen and all with ovarian failure, found
lumbar spine BMD losses of 4.0% at 1 year.18 Saarto et al
found BMD losses of 6.8% at the lumbar spine and 1.9%
in the femoral neck at 1 year in 22 patients.19 Finally, Delmas et al reported a lumbar spine BMD loss of 2.7% at 1
year.20
In summary, in studies involving mostly small numbers of patients, treatments with LHRH and chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen have demonstrated loss of
BMD in all treatment groups; the losses appear to be of
lower magnitude at the femoral region than in the lumbar
spine, there are trends for the initial losses to stabilize after
1 to 3 years, and tamoxifen lessens the BMD losses. The
results of the current large study in 270 women, with considerably less missing data than has been reported in the
noted studies (16 for example), are different than all of
these reports in demonstrating no significant change in
BMD at the femoral neck. Multiple complex hormonalbone interactions may explain these study result differences. Because Powles et al found increases of 1.17%
per year in the lumbar spine and 1.71% per year in
the trochanter in postmenopausal women treated with
3750

tamoxifen, it is reasonable to expect that in our populations further stabilization and possibly BMD increases at
both lumbar spine and femoral neck sites may occur with
continuing tamoxifen treatment.13
Interpreting these data is partially compromised by
the absence of comparison groups of patients. There are 2
general possible comparison groups of interest: 1) Women
with breast cancer (DCIS, for example) who have not
received systemic therapy or oophorectomy, or healthy
women without breast cancer; and 2) Women with similar breast cancers treated with more usual high-income
country combined chemotherapy/hormonal therapy. In
the clinical settings in which this study took place, the
numbers of such possible comparison patients were small.
A second broad global population applicability issue
about the data reported here concerns possible ethnic/
genetic differences in bone and drug metabolism in the
studied women, which might influence these results. We
are unaware of any data that would suggest that Filipino
or Vietnamese women might differ in basic hormonal/
bone biology in significant ways from women in Europe
or the United States. The absolute BMD levels in our
patients, despite short height and Asian ethnicity, which
are characteristics that have been associated with lower
BMD, are very similar to those populations (primarily
white patients) in other studied high-income countries.
Although the apparent absolute differences in BMD at
both measured sites between the ethnically different populations with higher levels seen in the Vietnamese patients
can be explained by differences in equipment used, analytic software, and environmental BMD determinants, it
is possible that genetic population differences exist. However, we found no significant differences between the 2
ethnic groups other than this absolute level parameter.
Interestingly, the absolute BMD levels at the lumbar spine
and femoral neck in our Vietnamese population were
higher than in a study of European women.16
A third possible weakness of the current report is
that we have no specific data on possible confounding factors such as family history of osteoporosis, alcohol abuse,
smoking, or calcium intake, which might lower BMD, or
vitamin D or activity levels, which in these populations
might increase BMD (because of large sun exposure and
high levels of physical activity). Fourth, we have missing
data on BMD measurements, but as discussed above these
are less extensive than in many reported studies.
Implications

Although fracture risks increase with decreased BMD, the
magnitude of the changes with the observed changes in

the studied populations is extremely difficult to assess.
There is a marked (as great as 10-fold variation) in ageadjusted fracture risk among countries.11 The World
Health Organization technical report recommends interpretation of BMD results using country-specific reference
populations.11 As an example, by standards for a white
population in which absolute femoral neck BMD of 0.62
to 0.85 g/cm2 are classified as osteopenic, two-thirds of
the 270 patients studied here would be considered osteopenic at baseline.
The results of this study have major implications for
the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women with
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, as treatment is
practiced in low- and middle-income countries. Because
there are data suggesting that surgical oophorectomy plus
tamoxifen is superior to LHRH plus tamoxifen (reviewed
above), and of equivalent benefit compared with chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and
5-fluorouracil plus LHRH plus tamoxifen, the similar
lumbar spine BMD losses and absence of BMD loss in the
femoral neck with the former treatment alters the overall
risk-benefit analysis for these treatments in favor of the
studied hormonal therapy.3,5 Should the primary hypothesis being tested in the parent trial be supported, that
luteal phase oophorectomy is more effective, then additional evidence would further favor this combined hormonal approach.21 The possibility that Her-2/neu-positive
tumor-bearing patients also benefit significantly from surgical oophorectomy plus tamoxifen also adds another important consideration in favor of this approach.22 Finally,
the repeated demonstrations of significant losses of BMD
at both lumbar and femoral neck sites with chemotherapy
and LHRH treatments have led to a multiplicity of studies
evaluating bisphosphonate adjuvant therapies. These have
generally demonstrated benefits in stabilizing or achieving
gains in BMD with this new treatment, but these therapies come with their own side effects (eg, jaw osteonecrosis) and particularly high financial costs. In low- and
middle-income countries where the majorities of premenopausal women with breast cancer reside, and where
oral hygiene is sadly poor, the results of this study are particularly important because they suggest that such additional bisphosphonate treatment may not be necessary to
maintain BMD and decrease long-term fracture risk.
