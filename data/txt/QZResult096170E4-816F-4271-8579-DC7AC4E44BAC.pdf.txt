ABSTRACT
Residual androgen receptor (AR)-signaling and presence of cancer stem-like
cells (SCs) are the two emerging paradigms for clinically challenging castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Therefore, identification of AR-target proteins that
are also overexpressed in the cancer SC population would be an attractive therapeutic
approach.
Our analysis of over three hundred clinical samples and patient-derived prostate
epithelial cultures (PPECs), revealed Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A
(CIP2A) as one such target. CIP2A is significantly overexpressed in both hormonenaïve prostate cancer (HN-PC) and CRPC patients . CIP2A is also overexpressed,
by 3- and 30-fold, in HN-PC and CRPC SCs respectively. In vivo binding of the AR to
the intronic region of CIP2A and its functionality in the AR-moderate and AR-high
expressing LNCaP cell-model systems is also demonstrated. Further, we show that AR
positively regulates CIP2A expression, both at the mRNA and protein level. Finally,
CIP2A depletion reduced cell viability and colony forming efficiency of AR-independent
PPECs as well as AR-responsive LNCaP cells, in which anchorage-independent growth
is also impaired.
These findings identify CIP2A as a common denominator for AR-signaling and
cancer SC functionality, highlighting its potential therapeutic significance in the most
clinically challenging prostate pathology: castration-resistant prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

advanced PC. However due to subsequent resistance to
androgen ablation, this approach fails to achieve a cure.
The resulting recurrent tumors are commonly known
as castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs). It has
now been demonstrated that these cells remain androgen
sensitive [2]. One third of the CRPCs harbor amplification
of the AR gene [1] . In addition, rearrangements of AR,
resulting in ligand independent activation of the receptor
has been reported [2]. Also, in antiandrogen treated
tumors, point mutations abrogating the effect of the drugs
have been identified [3] and it has been shown that CRPC
cells can produce low levels of androgens endogenously
[4]. These adaptations make CRPCs responsive to
the second line AR-signaling blocking drugs, such as
abiraterone and enzalutamide. But even these second
line drugs are effective only in a proportion of patients
and fail to completely cure responsive patients [5]. On
the other hand, the existence of cancer stem cells (SCs)
in advanced stage PC and CRPCs has been suggested as
another potential mechanism for resistance to drugs [6].
Several recent studies have suggested that cancer SCs
are androgen-independent [7, 8]. Together these results
indicate that efficient therapy for advanced stage PC would
require simultaneous targeting of two types of cancer cell
populations: those that are dependent on AR-signaling
and the AR-independent (cells that are non-responsive to
androgens) cancer stem-like cells.
CIP2A, an endogenous inhibitor of protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is a recently identified oncogene,
which is overexpressed in several tumour types at a
very high frequency [9-14]. In fact, its overexpression
is emerging as one of the most frequent alterations in
human cancers [13]. MYC, E2F1, AKT and mTOR have
so far been identified as downstream oncogenic effectors
of CIP2A [13, 15]. The clinical relevance of CIP2A, in
the form of a prognostic marker, has been established
for different human cancers [13]. Notably, in a study
involving small number of cases, CIP2A overexpression
was observed in hormone-naïve prostate cancer (HNPC) specimens and its expression was associated with
poorly differentiated and high-risk PCs [16]. However, its
functional role in prostate cancer cell biology still remains
elusive.

expression (Figure 1C). CIP2A protein expression was
also demonstrated in AR-positive PC cell lines (Figure
1D).
Next, we assessed the expression of CIP2A in the
different populations of cells from biopsy samples of BPH,
HN-PC and CRPC patients. We isolated the stem-like
cell (SC), transient amplifying cell (TA) and committed
basal cell (CB) populations using CD133, CD44 and α2β1
cell surface markers as shown in Figure S1A. We have
previously demonstrated that primary HN-PC tissue
and SC cells form serially transplantable subcutaneous
tumors in Rag2-/-γC-/- immune compromised mice, which
can form distant metastasis and multiple intraprostatic
tumors in nude mice when grafted orthotopically in a
matrigel plug containing human prostatic stroma [17].
As shown in Figure 2A, the expression of CIP2A in the
cancer stem-like cell (SC) population, was increased by
about three-fold in HN-PC-SCs and by about thirty-fold
in CRPC-SCs compared to BPH-SCs. In contrast, CIP2A
expression was decreased in TA and CB cell populations
in cancer (Figure S1B, S1C). Functionally, depletion
of CIP2A in the primary HN-PC PPECs cells with two
different siRNAs (Figure 2B) resulted in decrease in both
cell viability (Figure 2C) and colony forming capacity
(Figure 2D). Particularly, the colony forming capacity in
the BPH PPECs was not significantly altered on CIP2A
depletion (Figure 2D). Together these results indicate that
CIP2A is important for the survival of HN-PC stem-like
cell (SC) populations.
Having confirmed functional significance, we
next investigated the regulation of CIP2A expression.
Although, overexpression and a functional significance
of CIP2A in androgen-independent cancer SCs implied
AR-independent effects of CIP2A, we also have strong
evidence for AR-mediated CIP2A regulation in ARresponsive cells. A statistically significant association of
CIP2A immunopositivity with AR nuclear staining was
observed in primary HN-PC samples (Figure S2A;[18]).
ChIP-Seq data in prostate cancer cell lines from previously
published studies revealed an AR binding site in CIP2A
intronic region (Figure S2B). The in vivo functionality of
this site was demonstrated by an increase in AR binding
at this locus upon dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induction in
LNCaP cells using ChIP-qPCR (Figure 3A). The LNCaP
cells modified to expressed 2-4 (ARmo) and 6- (ARhi)
fold higher levels of AR compared to control (pcDNA3.1)
LNCaP cells [19] showed stronger binding (Figure 3A)
upon DHT treatment. In addition, an increase in CIP2A
mRNA expression was seen in LNCaP-ARhi compared to
LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells after treatment with even modest
doses of DHT (Figure 3B and S3A). Similarly, higher
CIP2A protein levels were observed in LNCaP-ARhi
cells in comparison to LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells with low
DHT stimulation (Figure 3C). Also, immunofluorescene
staining demonstrated higher CIP2A protein levels in
LNCaP-ARhi compared to LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 cells after

RESULTS
To study the role of CIP2A in prostate cancer, we
first investigated the expression and androgen regulation
of this gene in clinical tissue samples, prostate cancer cell
lines and different cell populations from benign prostate
hypertrophy (BPH), HN-PC and CRPC patient samples.
CIP2A was overexpressed in HN-PC and even more
in CRPC compared to BPH at the mRNA level (Figure
1A). Also immunostaining showed higher protein levels
in CRPC compared to HN-PC (Figure 1B, 1C). Notably,
99% of CRPC patient samples were positive for CIP2A

1nM DHT (24h) treatment (Figure S3B). These findings
are in line with our previous observations that androgenregulated genes are induced in cells overexpressing
AR, even in lower ligand concentrations [19]. Next, an
independent siRNA based approach to verify the role of
androgen receptor in CIP2A regulation was used. We
transfected two known AR-positive prostate cancer cell
lines, LNCaP and VCaP (Figure 3D), with siRNAs against
AR and estimated the CIP2A protein levels. As shown in
Figure 3D, AR depletion resulted in decreased CIP2A
protein expression in both the AR-positive prostate cancer
cell lines.
To assess whether the AR-mediated positive

regulation of CIP2A expression has any functional
consequence, we transfected LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 and
LNCaP-ARhi cells with CIP2A siRNAs and performed the
functional assays. As demonstrated in Figure 4A, about 4
to 5 fold decrease in cell viability was observed in both
LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 and LNCaP-ARhi cells. Further, we
demonstrated that CIP2A promotes clonogenicity (Figure
4B) and cellular transformation potential (Figure 4C)
of LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 and -ARhi cells using monolayer
clonogenic and anchorage-independent soft agar assays,
respectively. These functional studies clearly identify
AR as an upstream regulator of CIP2A, which in turn
positively modulates cell survival.

DISCUSSION

cascades.
In this study using patient-derived prostate epithelial
cultures (PPECs) and over three hundred clinical samples,
we identify CIP2A to be a common denominator for AR
and cancer SC-signaling functionality. We demonstrate
that CIP2A is overexpressed in PC and CRPC cases and
promotes the viability and clonogenicity of AR-responsive
prostate cancer cells. Notably, the difference in growth in
the LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 and LNCaP-ARhi cells was not
clearly apparent while doing the siRNA based functional
assays (Figure 4A-4C) despite different AR levels in these
two populations. This could be either be due to blunting
of the induction of CIP2A protein levels in ARhi cells
compared to the parental LNCaP cells (1.6 fold V’s 3.4
fold) as shown in Figure 3C, or due to usage of normal
serum medium to carry out the knock-down assays as the

Overexpression of AR has been commonly observed
not only in primary PCs but also in CRPC cases [1, 2,
4]. Its role in sensitizing tumor cells to low levels of
androgens has been a critical deterrent for effective
therapies in prostate cancer. Additionally, presence
of cancer stem cells adds another layer of complexity
for effective treatment, especially in CRPC cases [6].
Therefore, new therapeutic approaches that overcome
these hurdles are urgently required for an effective longterm therapy against prostate cancer. This can be achieved
by either using drug combinations that target AR-signaling
and cancer SC-signaling simultaneously, or by identifying
and targeting effector proteins common to these signaling

stress on the cells, due to the combination of transfection
reagent and presence of stripped medium or low DHT
conditions, is toxic for the cells. Further, we highlighted
the role of CIP2A protein in promoting the survival of the
PC stem-like cell (SC) populations. Importantly, several
recent studies have demonstrated the tumor suppressive
role of PP2A complex in prostate cancer [20-22]. Based
on these findings, we suggest therapeutic targeting of
CIP2A, an established endogenous inhibitor of PP2A [10,
11, 14] as a novel approach to simultaneous target both
the luminal type mass of prostate cancer, as well as the
tumor initiating capacity of the SC populations (Figure
4D). However, additional mouse pre-clinical studies are
required to further strengthen CIP2A’s role in therapy
against prostate cancer.
Altogether, as CIP2A depletion in many other
cancer models have been demonstrated to result in
robust antitumor effects [13, 23] and inhibition of
activity of several oncogenic driver pathways [13, 15,
23], these novel results highlight the potential remedial
role of CIP2A in the more resistant and therapeutically

challenging prostate cancer cases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples for mRNA expression
Freshly frozen primary prostate cancer samples
from prostatectomies (8 BPH and 27 untreated or HNPC
in addition to 15 CRPC specimens from transurethral
resection of the prostate-treated patients) were used in the
study. The samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
total RNA was isolated with Trizol-Reagent (Invitrogen
Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tumor
samples contained, at least, 70% cancer cells. The use
of the clinical material has been approved by the ethical
committee of the Tampere University Hospital.

Medical Center, and were grown under the recommended
conditions. With respect to primary cells prostate cancer
directed core biopsies from three HN-PC patients had
Gleason score of 4+3 while CRPCs were Gleason 9 (4+5,
one sample) and 10 (5+5, 2 samples) were processed to
establish cultures in stem cell medium (SCM) as described
before [24].

Tissue microarrays contained 185 formalinfixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy and 92 CRPC
(transurethral resection of the prostate) specimens obtained
from Tampere University Hospital. For the prostatectomytreated patients, detectable PSA values ≥0.5 ng/ml) in two
consecutive measurements or the emergence of metastasis
were considered as signs of progression. The use of tissue
microarrays has been approved by the ethical committee
of Tampere University Hospital and the National Authority
for Medicolegal Affairs. CIP2A immunopositivity was
graded in one to three tumour cores for each patient based
on the intensity of the cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in the
cancer cells, that is, 3 was strong, 2 moderate, 1 weak, and
0 negative. All samples were scored by, an experienced
uropathologist (T. Tolonen), without knowledge of clinical
status and outcome data.

Quantitative (q) RT-PCR
Cells were collected from dishes and their total RNA
was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis
was carried out from total RNA using AMV reverse
transcriptase (Finnzymes) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The primers for Q-RT-PCR were designed
with Primer3 program. SYBR Green II-Fast Start kit
(Roche Diagnostics) and Light Cycler apparatus (Roche
Diagnostics) were used for Q-RT-PCR. TBP (TATA box
binding protein) and Actin mRNA was used as a reference.
The specificity of the reactions was confirmed, in addition
to the melting curve analysis, with 1.5% agarose gel
electrophoresis.

Establishment of primary prostate epithelial
cultures and enrichment of prostate epithelial
sub-populations
The epithelial cultures from primary prostate
samples were established according to an established
protocol [24]. The postoperative prostate samples were
obtained with full ethical consent and were chopped
into fine pieces, which were then subjected to overnight
collagenase (Lorne Laboratories) treatment at 37oC. Then,
the stroma was separated by differential centrifugation
and prostate epithelial acini were further disrupted by
mechanical and enzymatic separation methods. At this
point, CD24 positive luminal cells were removed and
enriched by employing CD24 MACS immunomagnetic
beads (Miltenyi Biotec). The rest of the prostate epithelial
cells were then grown with irradiated STOs on collagen
I coated plastic plates in a stem cell media at 37oC with
5% CO2. Cells were sub-cultured typically when they
were 80-90% confluent by splitting them into 1:3 or 1:4
proportions. At passage two; cultured epithelial cells were
selected on the basis of expression of α2β1-integrin, CD44,
and CD133 expression by employing rapid collagen
adhesion and CD133 MACS fractionation (Figure S1A).

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfections
The siRNAs to inhibit CIP2A expression were
obtained from Eurofins MWG operon (Ebersberg,
Germany).

a 6-well plate using Oligofectamine (Life Technology).
2mL of SCM was added after 4 hours in each well. After
4 more hours, wells were washed with PBS twice and 2
mL of fresh SCM was added. Cells were harvested at 72
hours after transfection to determine the effect on protein
expression.

protein extracts were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes
were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS-0.1%-NP40
and then incubated with mouse monoclonal AR (AR441,
NeoMarkers-Lab Vision Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA),
goat polyclonal anti-β-Actin (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or with mouse monoclonal antiCIP2A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For
primary PC cells CytoBuster (Merck Millipore) buffer was
used to lyse freshly cultured cells to extract proteins.

Immunoflourescence
LNCaP-pcDNA3.1 and LNCaP-ARhi cells were
seeded on sterilized coverslips placed in each well of a
6-well plate overnight and the cells were then treated with
1nM DHT for 24hours. Subsequently the cover slips were
placed in fresh sterilized wells and then washed with PBS
before being fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min
at 37° C. Then after washing with PBS twice, cells were
treated with 0.5% NP-40 for 5min at room temperature.
This was followed by blocking the cells with 0.5% bovine
serum albumin for 30 min. Cells were then exposed to
the following primary antibody dilutions, CIP2A; 1: 250
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After which
the cells were washed with PBS 3 times and incubated
in FITC-conjugated goat anti Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen–
Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, USA) for 1h at 37°C.
Next cells were then stained with the Vectashield antifade
solution (Vector Laboratories) containing 0.001 mol/L
4′,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole as counterstain and cells
observed under the microscope and the images taken.

Cell viability
One day before transfection of CIP2A.1 or CIP2A.2
siRNAs, LNCaP and LNCaP-ARhi cells were seeded in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS at a
density of 1 × 103 to 2 × 103 cells per well in 96-well
plates. The cells were transfected with the following
-Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, 33 nM scrambled siRNA
or 33 nM CIP2A.1 or CIP2A.2. Cells were then cultured
for 3 and 6 days post-transfection before relative numbers
of viable cells were measured by fluorescence at the
544 and 590 nm wavelengths in a FLUOstar OPTIMA
Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech, Inc., Durham, NC),
using the resazurin-based CellTiter-Blue Assay (Promega
Corporation) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
In case of primary PC cells, 20µl of cell suspension was
added to an equal volume of 0.4% Trypan Blue Stain
(Sigma-Aldrich). The live cells were counted using
modified Neubauer’s haemocytometer.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

Soft agar and monolayer clonogenic assays

CIP2A ARBS was identified in previously published
ChIP-seq dataset and ChIP was carried out as described
before [25]. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with
10 µg of normal rabbit IgG, 10 µl of anti-AR polyclonal

At 48 hours after transfection, LNCaP (1 × 104
per dish) were suspended in 1 mL of 0.25% agarose
(GellyPhor; EuroClone Spa, Pero, Italy) supplemented
with 2 mL complete RPMI-1640 culture medium
(changed every third day). This suspension was layered
over 1 mL of a base layer of 0.5% agarose in complete
medium in six-well plates. After 8 or 12 days in agarose,
cells were stained with Giemsa 1:20 in water (SigmaAldrich), the wells were scanned using the Surveyor
Software (Objective Imaging Ltd.) with camera (Imaging
Inc., Canada) attached to the Olympus IX71 (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) microscope and colonies were counted by
analysis with ImageJ Software (Wayne Rasband, National
Institutes of Health, Betheseda, MD). Cell groupings
that were greater than 1200 pixels in diameter with
3.2× enlargements were counted as colonies. In case of
primary PC cells, CIP2A and scrambled siRNAs were
transfected into these cells for a day, after which they were
trypsynised and 250 cells were plated in each well of the
6-well Collagen-I coated plates (BD Biosciences). Cells
were plated in triplicates with 2 ml of stem cell medium
(SCM) and 500 µl of irradiated STO feeder cells per well.

Immunohistochemistry
Mouse Anti-CIP2A (Novus Biosciences.) was used
with Power Vision+ Poly-HRP IHC kit (ImmunoVision
