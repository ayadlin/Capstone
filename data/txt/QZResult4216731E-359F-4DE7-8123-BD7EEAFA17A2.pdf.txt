ABSTRACT
Aldosterone (Aldo) is an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease
(CKD), and although Aldo directly induces renal tubular cell injury, the underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. NLRP3 inflammasome and mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS) have recently been implicated in various kinds of CKD. The present
study hypothesized that mitochondrial ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome mediated Aldo–
induced tubular cell injury. The NLRP3 inflammasome is induced by Aldo in a doseand time-dependent manner, as evidenced by increased NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and
downstream cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. The activation of the
NLRP3 inflammasome was significantly prevented by the selective mineralocorticoid
receptor (MR) antagonist eplerenone (EPL) (P < 0.01). Mice harboring genetic
knock-out of NLRP3 (NLRP3-/-) showed decreased maturation of renal IL-1β and IL18, reduced renal tubular apoptosis, and improved renal epithelial cell phenotypic
alternation, and attenuated renal function in response to Aldo-infusion. In addition,
mitochondrial ROS was also increased in Aldo-stimulated HK-2 cells, as assessed
by MitoSOXTM red reagent. Mito-Tempo, the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant,
significantly decreased HK-2 cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the activation of
NLRP3 inflammasome. We conclude that Aldo induces renal tubular cell injury via MR
dependent, mitochondrial ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

INTRODUCTION

injury has been suggested to be an important mechanism
for the progression of CKD, which ultimately leads
to tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Tubular cell apoptosis
was demonstrated to be involved in the progression of
polycystic kidney disease [8]. Yuan et al. demonstrated
that Aldo induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and renal proximal tubular cells injury via
mitochondrial dysfunction [9]. Patni et al. also showed
that Aldo induced tubular epithelial cell apoptosis through
the excessive production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) [2]. These data suggested a contribution of Aldo
to the progression of renal tubular injury. However, the
underlying mechanism of Aldo-induced renal tubular
injury is still not fully understood.

Aldosterone (Aldo) is produced in the adrenal zona
glomerulosa, and mediates salt and water homeostasis
by interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors (MR),
which are expressed in renal epithelial cells [1-3].
Recently, a growing body of evidence indicates that the
direct action of Aldo on the MR plays a key role in the
progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Exogenous
infusion of Aldo was able to reverse the protective effects
of angiotensin II blockade in the remnant kidney rat
model [4, 5]. Moreover, rats receiving MR antagonist
displayed significantly attenuated renal injury induced by
cyclosporine A and radiation [6, 7]. Recently, tubular cell

Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation
in the absence of pathogens, referred to as sterile
inflammation, mediated via the inflammasome.
Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat
containing PYD-3 (NLRP3) is the best characterized
inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a
cytoplasmic protein complex that is activated upon signs
of cellular ‘danger’ to trigger innate immune defenses.
Upon detecting cellular stress, NLRP3 recruits the adaptor
protein ASC and procaspase-1, which results in caspase-1
activation and processing of cytoplasmic targets, including
interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 [10, 11]. Recently, the
NLRP3 inflammasome was demonstrated to participate
in the pathogenesis of kidney disease. NLRP3 deficiency
was shown to ameliorate renal inflammation and fibrosis
in a model of renal tubular injury [12, 13]. These studies
suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the
development of various kinds of CKD.
Several mechanisms underlying the activation
of the NLRP3 inflammasome have been demonstrated,
including ion channel gating, lysosome rupture, and
excessive ROS generation. The notion of activation of
the NLRP3 inflammasome by increased ROS production
was widely accepted and it was suggested that the NLRP3
inflammasome may be a general sensor for changes in

cellular oxidative stress [14, 15]. Additionally, the role
of mitochondria as the main source of cellular ROS has
also been explored. Various triggers induce mitochondrial
ROS generation, such as hypoxia, cell membrane damage,
and increased metabolic rates [16]. Zhang et al. showed
that Aldo induced EMT via mitochondrial ROS in renal
tubular epithelial cells [3]. However, the role of the
NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its correlation with
mitochondrial ROS in Aldo-induced renal tubular injury
still remains unknown. The purpose of this study was
to investigate whether mitochondrial ROS-mediated the
activation of NLRP3 inflammasome that contributes to
Aldo-induced renal tubular injury.

RESULTS
Aldosterone induces NLRP3 inflammasome
activation in HK-2 cells
To evaluate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
in Aldo-treated tubular epithelial cells, we assessed the
markers of inflammasome activation including NLRP3,
ASC, posttranslational processing of caspase-1 (cleaved

caspase-1, Caspase-1 P20), and the proinflammatory
cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. As shown in Figure 1, protein
expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1β and IL18 significantly increased following Aldo stimulation
of HK-2 cells for 24 h, in a dose-dependent manner.
Similarly, protein expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1,
IL-1β and IL-18 were markedly increased in HK-2 cells
after treatment with Aldo in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 2). The increased expression of these proteins was
detected as early as 12 h after treatment with Aldo (10-7
M). These results indicate that Aldo treatment triggered
activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in HK-2 cells.

siNLRP3 resulted in a 60% reduction of NLRP3 protein
expression in HK-2 cells (Figure 3A). Knockdown of
NLRP3 also significantly decreased Aldo-dependent
induction of mature IL-1β and IL-18 protein expression
(Figure 3B). Similarly, the MR antagonist EPL also
markedly reduced Aldo-dependent induction of IL-1β and
IL-18 protein expression (Figure 3B-3D).

SiNLRP3 attenuates Aldo-induced phenotypic
alternation and apoptosis
To further examine the role of NLRP3 in the
phenotypic alternation of HK-2 cells induced by Aldotreatment, we analyzed E-cadherin and α-SMA protein
expression by western blot. E-cadherin protein expression
was significantly decreased and a-SMA protein expression
was significantly increased in Aldo-treated group
compared to the control HK-2 cells (Figure 3B, 3E,
and 3F). In contrast, treatment with siNLRP3 or EPL
markedly attenuated loss of E-cadherin and induction of
α-SMA protein expression (Figure 3B, 3E, and 3F). We
also examined the role of NLRP3 in the induction of

apoptosis of HK-2 cells. Apoptosis was detected using
flow cytometric methods to assess Annexin-V, propidium
iodide, and TUNEL assays. The apoptosis of HK-2 cells
in the Aldo-treated group was significantly higher than
the control group (Figure 4A, 4B), and the induction
of apoptosis was markedly inhibited by treatment with
siNLRP3. Moreover, EPL also inhibited HK-2 cell
apoptosis (Figure 4C, 4D). These results indicate that Aldo
induces renal tubular cell injury via an MR-dependent
pathway which is mediated through activation of the

or NLRP3-/- /sham mice (Figure 5A, 5B, 5E). However,
after mice were infused with Aldo, significant apoptosis
was showed in kidney cortical tissues in the WT/Aldo
group (Figure 5C, 5E). Importantly, much less apoptosis
was measured in tubular cells of the NLRP3-/- /Aldo group
(Figure 5D, 5E). Serum creatinine and BUN levels were
markedly elevated in WT/Aldo mice compared to WT/
sham mice. However, serum creatinine and BUN levels
were reduced in NLRP3-/- /Aldo mice compared to WT/
Aldo mice (Figure 5F and 5G). Similarly, the urine
albumin/creatinine ratio was increased in WT/Aldo mice
relative to WT/sham mice; the increased urine albumin/
creatinine ratio was moderately recovered in the NLRP3-/- /
Aldo mice (Figure 5H).

in the pathophysiological feature of Aldo-induced renal
injury in vivo. As shown in Figure 5, Very little apoptosis

However, these indicators of phenotypic alternation were
not observed in the NLRP3-/- /Aldo mice (Figure 6D, 6E).

vitro

As shown in Figure 6, renal IL-1β and IL-18 protein
were significantly increased in WT/Aldo mice compared
with WT/sham mice. Importantly, Aldo-dependent
induction of renal IL-1β and IL-18 protein was inhibited
in NLRP3-/- /Aldo mice (Figure 6A-6C). Serum IL-1β

mice, renal E-cadherin protein was reduced and renal
α-SMA was significantly increased in WT/Aldo mice.

ROS in Aldo-induced renal injury [17], thus we then
tested whether mitochondrial ROS is triggered by Aldo

Inhibition of mitochondrial ROS attenuates

To determine whether Aldo-induced NLRP3
inflammasome activation was mediated by mitochondrial
ROS in HK-2 cells, we evaluated the NLRP3
inflammasome and its downstream effectors, ASC, IL-1β
and IL-18. The expression of NLRP3, ASC, and mature
IL-1β and IL-18 protein were significantly increased
in HK-2 cells following Aldo stimulation; treatment
with Mito-Tempo markedly inhibited these protein
expression patterns. Similarly, EPL also prevented NLRP3
inflammasome activation in HK-2 cells in response to
Aldo stimulation (Figure 9A-9F).

To determine the role of mitochondrial ROS in Aldoinduced epithelial tubular injury, we examined apoptosis
and phenotypic alternation in HK-2 cells following
stimulation with Aldo. Aldo stimulation significantly
reduced renal E-cadherin and significantly increased
renal α-SMA (Figure 8A-8C). However, treatment with
Mito-Tempo significantly reversed these Aldo-induced
patterns of protein expression (Figure 8A-8C). Similarly,
tubular cell apoptosis was significantly increased in the
Aldo-treated group compared to the control group, and the

DISCUSSION

the renal collecting duct through ROS-dependent signals
[19]. Liu et al. also demonstrated that the NLRP3 and
IL-18 proteins are localized in the proximal tubular
cells in kidney biopsy specimens from patients with
IgA nephropathy; these NLRP3 inflammasome levels
were closely correlated with the extent of proteinuria
and tubulointerstitial fibrosis [20, 21]. In the present
study, we found that Aldo increased the activation of the
NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream cytokines in
a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, silencing
of the NLRP3 inflammasome significantly reversed Aldoinduced apoptosis and phenotypic alternation in vitro,
suggesting that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role
in the progression of renal tubular cells injury.
NLRP3 is a detrimental factor in some models of
proteinuric or nonproteinuric kidney injury. In these
studies, NLRP3 knockout (KO, NLRP3-/-) mice were
resistant to kidney injury via inhibiting inflammatory
processes [22-24]. In the present study, we characterized

Although a large number of researches suggest
that Aldo plays a pathogenic role in the development
of kidney disease, the underlying mechanism of Aldoinduced CKD remains incompletely understood. In present
study, we demonstrate that Aldo induces renal tubular
injury through mitochondrial ROS-mediated NLRP3
inflammasome activation. Our data suggest that the
NLRP3 inflammasome may serve as a therapeutic target in
the prevention or treatment of Aldo-induced tubular injury.
Inflammation is part of the normal response to tissue
damage. Recently, the NLR family of pattern recognition
receptors has been shown to mediate various disease
processes via the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
[18]. Komada et al. demonstrated that inflammasome
related molecules were increased in the kidney of a UUO
model, and that extracellular adenosine triphosphate
triggered inflammasome activation in epithelial cells of

the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating
inflammatory responses in Aldo-induced renal tubular
injury. We found that indicators of kidney damage,
including apoptosis and phenotypic alternation of renal
tubular cells, were attenuated in Aldo-infused NLRP3-/mice compared with Aldo-infused WT mice. Furthermore,
the NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream cytokines IL1β and IL-18 were also inhibited in Aldo-infused NLRP3/mice. Taken together, these data suggest that the NLRP3
inflammasome plays a key role in renal injury triggered
by Aldo in vivo.
IL-1β and IL-18 are two inflammatory cytokines
implicated in various kinds of CKD, and several
studies demonstrated that IL-1β and IL-18 could induce
expression of mesenchymal markers in tubular epithelial
cells [25, 26]. It has also been demonstrated that IL-1β
and IL-18 are significantly increased in Aldo-induced
renal inflammation and fibrosis in vivo [27, 28], suggesting
that IL-1β and IL-18 may be the key mediators of Aldo-

induced renal injury, although the exact mechanisms
remained unclear. In present study, we demonstrate
that Aldo stimulation induces the production of mature
IL-1β/IL-18 in renal tubular cells in a dose- and timedependent manner. Moreover, we show that silencing of
the NLRP3 inflammasome in HK-2 cells significantly
decreased expression of mature IL-1β and IL-18, and
reduced apoptosis. Similarly, mature IL-1β and IL-18
were markedly decreased in kidney samples from Aldoinfused NLRP3-/- mice, indicating that the absence of
NLRP3 ameliorates renal tubular injury and improves
renal function, and suggesting that NLRP3 inflammasomedependent mature IL-1β/IL-18 release may be implicated
in renal tubular inflammation and injury. These data
suggest an important role for the NLRP3 inflammasome/
IL-1β/IL-18 axis in the progression of Aldo-induced renal
injury.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

of renal tubular cells. Interestingly, ROS was also
shown to mediate the downstream mechanism of Aldoinduced renal tubular cells injury [2, 17]. Swerdlow et al.
demonstrated that excessive ROS production was closely
linked to mitochondrial function [29]. Furthermore,
accumulation of mitochondrial ROS was sufficient to
activate the NLRP3 inflammasome [14, 30, 31]. However,
the role of the mitochondrial ROS/NLRP3 inflammasome
axis was still unclear in Aldo-induced renal injury. MitoTempo is a nitroxide linked to a positively charged
triphenyl phosphonium cation, and is targeted specifically
to the mitochondria [32]. Mito-Tempo treatment markedly
abolishes mitochondrial ROS production, caspase-1
activation, and mtDNA translocation in response to LPS
and ATP [33]. Notably, in our present study we also
found that the production of mitochondrial ROS was
significantly increased in response to Aldo stimulation of
HK-2 cells in vitro. Treatment with Mito-Tempo markedly
abolished mitochondrial ROS, decreased renal tubular cell
apoptosis, and attenuated phenotypic alteration associated
with Aldo-stimulation of HK-2 cells. Furthermore, MitoTempo significantly inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome
and its relative downstream cytokines. These findings
support the growing importance of the mitochondrial
ROS-activated NLRP3 inflammasome in Aldo-induced
renal tubular cell injury.
MR was suggested to mediate the pathogenic
role of Aldo in a model of CKD. Recent reports suggest
the anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effect of an MR
antagonist in the progression of CKD [34, 35]. In present
study, we demonstrate that Aldo induces mitochondrial
oxidative stress and apoptosis in renal tubular cells via an
MR-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, Aldo stimulation
induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
and its downstream cytokines, which was dependent on
excessive mitochondrial ROS. Blockade of MR with EPL
significantly prevented mitochondrial ROS production and
activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together,
these results indicate that MR is responsible for the proinflammatory effect of Aldo in renal tubular cells.
In summary, our study demonstrates that Aldo
induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation via MR in
vitro and in vivo. Mitochondrial ROS are involved
in Aldo-induced renal tubular injury, and may act as
redox-signaling messengers. The mitochondrial-targeted
antioxidant significantly inhibited oxidative stress,
activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and attenuated
HK-2 cell injury following treatment with Aldo. These
results support the concept that mitochondrial ROS
triggers the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
leading to Aldo-induced renal injury. Our characterization
of the mitochondrial/NLRP3 inflammasome axis may
provide new insight into the pathogenic progression of
Aldo-induced kidney damage.

with NLRP3 small interfering RNA
HK-2 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37ºC and
5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Transient transfection
of HK-2 cells with siRNA was previously demonstrated

Apoptosis detection with Annexin V/propidium
iodide staining and Hoechst 33258 staining

µl TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37ºC in the dark.
For quantification, 10-20 fields were randomly selected
from each tissue section, and the number of TUNELpositive cells was counted per millimeter.

Annexin V is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding
protein with a high affinity for phosphatidylserine, which
is externalized on the surface of the cell membrane during
the progression of apoptosis. Detection of apoptosis in
HK-2 cells according to the Annexin V/propidium iodide
method (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) was performed
as previously described [17]. After treatment, HK-2
cells were seeded into six-well plates and indicators of
apoptosis were determined on a FACScan flow cytometer
(Epics Altra, Beckman Coulter, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For detecting apoptosis with
Hoechst 33258, HK-2 cells were grown on glass coverslips
and were staining with Hoechst 33258 after treatment;
staining was then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.

ROS and mitochondrial superoxide measurement
The fluorogenic substrate DCFDA was used to
detect the whole intracellular production of ROS, as
previously described. To measure ROS levels, HK-2 cells
were seeded into six well plates, and allowed to grow
until they reached confluent cell density. Plates were
treated with 10 µl DCFDA for 30 min at 37 ºC in the dark.
HK-2 cells were then washed twice, and fluorescence
was measured using a fluorescence plate reader at the
excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 528 nm,
respectively [17]. Mitochondrial ROS were also detected
with MitoSOXTM Red reagent. Briefly, six well plates
were treated with MitoSOXTM Red (5µM) for 30 min at 37
ºC in the dark. For the inhibition of mitochondrial ROS,
Mito-Tempo (10µM) or EPL (10µM) were added for an
additional 15 min. Fluorescence was then measured as
described above.

Animal studies
All animal experiments were performed according to
the approval of the animal care committee at the Jiaotong
University. C57BL/6J (wild type, WT) mice were obtained
from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animals (Shanghai,
China). NLRP3-/- mice (C57BL/6J genetic background)
were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Sacramento,
CA). All mice underwent left uninephrectomy under
anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital. After 10 days of
recovery from surgery, mice were given high-salt drinking
water (containing 1% sodium chloride). An osmotic minipump (Alzet model 2004) was implanted subcutaneously
to infuse Aldo (0.75 µg/h) or vehicle control (0.5%
ethanol) for 4 weeks. Mice were allowed to recover with
free access to food and drinking water. All mice were
sacrificed at week 4, whereupon plasma samples were
collected. At sacrifice, sections of kidney were harvested
and fixed in 10% formalin, followed by embedding in
paraffin for histological evaluation. The remainder of the
kidney was used for mRNA and protein analysis. Serum
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and excreted levels
of urinary albumin and creatinine were measured by
automatic analyzers (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Serum IL-1β
and IL-18 were measured with ELISA kits (RayBiotech,
Norcross, GA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± the standard error of
the mean (SEM). One-way ANOVA was used to compare
mean values; results with P < 0.05 were considered
significant.
