ABSTRACT
Tumor initiating cells (TICs), responsible for tumor initiation, and cancer stem
cells (CSCs), responsible for tumor expansion and propagation, are often resistant to
chemotherapeutic agents. To find therapeutic targets against sarcoma initiating and
propagating cells we used models of myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) and undifferentiated
pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) developed from human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells
(hMSCs), which constitute the most likely cell-of-origin for sarcoma. We found that
SP1-mediated transcription was among the most significantly altered signaling. To
inhibit SP1 activity, we used EC-8042, a mithramycin (MTM) analog (mithralog) with
enhanced anti-tumor activity and highly improved safety. EC-8042 inhibited the growth
of TIC cultures, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and upregulated the adipogenic
factor CEBPα. SP1 knockdown was able to mimic the anti-proliferative effects induced
by EC-8042. Importantly, EC-8042 was not recognized as a substrate by several ABC
efflux pumps involved in drug resistance, and, opposite to the chemotherapeutic
drug doxorubicin, repressed the expression of many genes responsible for the TIC/
CSC phenotype, including SOX2, C-MYC, NOTCH1 and NFκB1. Accordingly, EC-8042,
but not doxorubicin, efficiently reduced the survival of CSC-enriched tumorsphere
sarcoma cultures. In vivo, EC-8042 induced a profound inhibition of tumor growth
associated to a strong reduction of the mitotic index and the induction of adipogenic
differentiation and senescence. Finally, EC-8042 reduced the ability of tumor cells to
reinitiate tumor growth. These data suggest that EC-8042 could constitute an effective
treatment against both TIC and CSC subpopulations in sarcoma.

which are the normal cells that acquire the first cancerpromoting mutations and initiate tumor formation [2].
It has been recently established that transformed MSCs
and/or their immediate lineage progenitors are the most
likely cell-of-origin for many types of sarcomas [3,
4]. Accordingly, many efforts have been undertaken
to produce models of sarcomas based on MSCs
transformed with relevant oncogenic events. This kind
of models constitutes unparalleled systems to unravel the
mechanisms underlying sarcomagenesis from the cell of

INTRODUCTION
Sarcomas often show a limited clinical response
to cytotoxic drugs which still remain as the most utilized
agents for generalized treatment of soft tissue sarcomas
[1]. A hypothesis to explain the resistance of sarcomas
to chemotherapy is the existence of drug-resistant
CSCs, which are responsible of tumor progression and
propagation. These subpopulations of CSCs emerge
during tumor evolution from the cell-of-origin or TICs,

origin, to explore the evolution of CSCs subpopulations
and to search for specific therapies able to eliminate these
populations.
In the search for new therapeutic targets,
transcription factors (TFs) presenting altered activity
offer a promising choice since they are pivotal points in
signaling pathways and therefore their inhibition may
block several routes involved in tumor progression [5]. In
this line, several members of the SP family of TFs, such as
SP1, SP3 and SP4, have been found to play an important
role in the pathogenesis of some cancers including
sarcomas and may constitute relevant therapeutic targets
[6-10]. MTM is an antitumoral antibiotic natural product
that binds preferentially to GC-rich sequences in DNA and
prevents the binding of SP TFs in gene promoters, thus
inhibiting the transcription of SP-regulated genes [11].
MTM showed strong response rates in cancer treatment
although its clinical use was limited due to its adverse side
effects [12]. Nevertheless, new studies reporting specific
modes of action in certain histologies, like Ewing sarcoma
[13], has renewed the interest in MTM and have warranted
the development of two clinical trials (http://www.
clinicaltrials.gov, NCT016110570 and NCT01624090).
Genetic engineering of the MTM biosynthesis
pathway has been used to generate mithralogs showing an
efficient inhibition of the SP-mediated gene expression and
bearing both lower toxicity and higher biological activity
[14-16]. Recently, the new mithralog demycarosyl-3Dβ-D-digitoxosyl-mithramycin SK (EC-8042; DIG-MSK)
has been obtained and characterized [17]. As expected,
EC-8042 preferentially binds GC-rich sequences, is a
potent inhibitor of SP-driven gene expression and shows
pleiotropic anti-angiogenic and anti-oncogenic activities
[18-20]. EC-8042 altered the expression of cell cycle
related genes resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
in breast cancer cell lines [21]. In Ewing sarcoma, EC8042 was substantially less toxic than mithramycin
but maintained suppression of EWS-FLI1 at similar
concentrations as MTM, and markedly suppressed Ewing
sarcoma xenograft growth [22]. More importantly, EC8042 shows a potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity
against several tumors types similar to other analogues
but is 10-fold less toxic in vivo than MTM [17], enabling
it as the lead candidate in the quest for mithralogs with
improved therapeutic window potentially useful in the
clinical setting.
We have recently established and characterized
pioneer models of UPS and MLS developed from
sequentially mutated human bone marrow-derived MSCs
(hBMSCs) [23-25]. To find specific therapies able to
target TICs in sarcoma we search for altered TF-mediated
signaling in these sarcoma models. We found that SP1mediated transcription was among the most significantly
altered signaling and that the inhibition of SP1 expression
and activity by EC-8042 efficiently inhibited the in vitro
and in vivo growth in these models of sarcoma initiating

cells. EC-8042 repressed the expression of important
genes associated to the TIC/CSC phenotype and was
able to inhibit the growth of tumorsphere cultures and the
ability to reinitiate tumor growth, suggesting that EC-8042
could constitute an effective treatment against both the
TIC and the CSC subpopulations in sarcoma.

RESULTS
SP1-mediated signaling is altered in sarcomainitiating transformed hBMSCs
We have previously developed and characterized
sarcoma models using hBMSCs sequentially mutated
with up to 5 oncogenic events. This collection of hBMSCs
ranges from wt (MSC-0H) to fully transformed hBMSCs
(MSC-5H). In addition, the fusion oncogene FUS-CHOP
(FC), characteristic of MLS, or the corresponding GFPcontrol, is ectopically expressed in all the MSC types
(Supplementary Figure S1A) [23-25]. MSC-4H-GFP cells
are immortalized, but not transformed and the rest of the
MSC types are transformed and originate sarcomas in vivo
[23, 25]. Thus, MSC-5H-GFP give rise to pleomorphic
undifferentiated sarcomas, meanwhile FUS-CHOPexpressing hBMSCs (MSC-4H-FC, and MSC-5H-FC)
initiate MLS-like tumors. Several cell lines were also
derived from xenograft tumors generated by transformed
hMSCs (T-4H-FC#1, T-4H-FC#3, T5H-GFP#1 and T5HFC#1) (Supplementary Figure S1A).
To identify altered signaling in this sarcoma TICs we
performed a gene-expression profiling (GEP) comparing
wild type and transformed hBMSCs types. Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed
genes revealed the upstream regulation signaling most
significantly altered in MSC-5H-GFP, MSC-5H-FC and
T-5H-FC#1 cells (Supplementary Figure S1B). All these
cell types displayed a similar pattern of transcription
factor-mediated signaling deregulation, with SP1mediated transcription being the most significantly altered
signaling that showed a higher positive activation z-score
(a predictive value of activation/inhibition) in all cell
lines (Supplementary Figure S1B). Accordingly, RT-PCR
analysis showed that the expression of SP1 and two known
SP1-target genes, C-MYC and XIAP, was upregulated in
MSC-5H-GFP, MSC-5H-FC, T-5H-GFP#1 and T-5H-FC#1
cells (Figure 1A). Importantly, 24 hours-treatment with 0.5
μM EC-8042 efficiently inhibited the expression of SP1 and
their downstream targets, both at mRNA and protein level,
in MSC-5H-FC#1 and T-5H-FC#1 cells (Figure 1B–1C).
Moreover, EC-8042 also decreased the expression of other
members of the SP family which may show certain level
of overlap with SP1-induced signaling [6]. Thus, EC-8042
treatment inhibited the expression of SP3 in both MSC-5HFC#1 and T-5H-FC#1 cell types and SP4 in MSC-5H-FC
(Supplementary Figure S2). In addition, it was previously
reported that SP1 repressed the expression of the adipogenic

of SP1 activity with EC-8042 resulted in a concentrationdependent activation of C/EBPα (Figure 1D).

sensitive to sub-micromolar concentrations of EC-8042 or
doxorubicin (IC50 between 0.107 and 0.311 μM for EC8042 and between 0.086 and 0.604 μM for doxorubicin).
Likewise, EC-8042 showed a similar cytotoxic effect
on a low-passaged primary sarcoma patient-derived
cell line (Supplementary Figure S3A). To explore the
mechanism underlying the antiproliferative effect of
EC-8042, we examined the effect of this drug on the cell

the expression of ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCG2 (BCRP1)
and ABCC1 (MRP1) in MSC-5H cells (Figure 3A).
Nevertheless, neither MTM nor EC-8042 inhibited the
pumping activity of ABC transporters (Figure 3B). More
importantly, a functional assay showed that ABCG2 and
ABCB1 proteins failed to transport both MTM and EC8042 (Figure 3C). This behavior is in stark contrast to most
chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin, which
are known substrates of ABC transporters [30]. Given
that drug resistance caused by enhanced ABC proteins
expression and activity is a hallmark of both normal stem
cells and CSCs [31], the inability of ABC transporters
to pump out EC-8042, together with the capacity of this
mithralog to repress the expression of ABC transporters
genes, suggest that EC-8042 could efficiently target CSC
subpopulations.

cycle distribution. MSC-5H-FC cells treated with 0.1 μM
EC-8042 showed a slow transition through the S-phase
followed by G2 arrest, meanwhile cells treated with a
higher concentration also showed a relevant increment
in the Sub-G1 apoptotic population at latter times (Figure
1G). In line with this result, MSC-5H-FC and T-5H-FC#1
cells treated with low concentrations (0.01-0.05 μM)
of EC-8042 stained positive for senescence-associated
β-galactosidase activity (Supplementary Figure S4),
suggesting the induction of a senescence-like state, while
higher concentrations of EC-8042 (0.5 μM) induced a
time-dependent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
apoptotic cleavage in a similar way to doxorubicin (Figure
1H). Thus, EC-8042 treatment induced cell cycle arrest
followed by apoptotic cell death in sarcoma TICs.
To confirm that SP1 inhibition mediates the antiproliferative effects of EC-8042, we performed siRNA
knockdown of this transcription factor in MSC-5H-FC
cells. Two different siRNA duplexes inhibit SP1 protein
expression to levels comparable to that observed after a
24 hour treatment with EC-8042. These SP1 knockdowns
correlate with the inhibition of C-MYC and the induction
of PARP apoptotic cleavage (Figure 2A). Likewise, SP1
depletion induces a time-dependent cytotoxic effect
(Figure 2B). Therefore, SP1 knockdown seems to mimic
the anti-proliferative effects induced by EC-8042.

EC-8042 decreases the expression of genes
associated to the CSC phenotype
To gain further insight about the ability of EC-8042
to affect the CSC phenotype in sarcoma, we performed RTPCR in T-5H-FC#1 cells treated for 24h with 0.5 μM EC8042 or doxorubicin to analyze the expression of an array
of 84 genes with well known functions in pluripotency,
self-renewal, migration, metastasis and signal transduction
in CSCs as well as several CSC markers. EC-8042 and
doxorubicin induced statistical significant changes (fold
change≥2; p-value<0.05) in the expression of 42 and
30 genes respectively (Figure 4A–4D). Notably, the
way these drugs altered CSC-related gene expression is
strikingly different. Most genes affected by doxorubicin
treatment were upregulated (21 upregulated genes and
9 downregulated genes) (Figure 4B & 4D), whereas
EC-8042-treatment induced the downregulation of
almost all the altered genes (3 upregulated genes and 39
downregulated genes) (Figure 4A & 4C). Confirming
the effect of EC-8042 over SP1-mediated transcription,
several genes known to be controlled by SP1 were

EC-8042 decreases the expression of ABC
transporters and is not a substrate for them
Previous reports showed that the expression of
several members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC)
transmembrane protein family is regulated by SP1 and
can be repressed by MTM treatment [27-29]. These ABC
proteins act as efflux pumps for drugs and metabolites
and cause drug resistance in tumor cells. Therefore, we
studied the effect of EC-8042 on the expression of the 3
members of the family most commonly involved in drug
resistance of cancer cells. EC-8042 was able to decrease

These data are in line with previous works reporting
that CSCs are resistant to doxorubicin treatment and
therefore this drug may favor a CSC positive selection

treatment may disadvantage the CSC phenotype in

the tumorespheres formed from MSC-5H-FC and T-5HFC#1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, EC8042 treatment efficiently prevent tumorsphere formation
from a primary patient-derived cell line (Supplementary
Figure S3B). To further confirm the effect of EC-8042
on CSC subpopulations, we assayed cell viability after
direct treatment of tumorsphere cultures (Figure 6A).
After treatment with doxorubicin and especially with
EC-8042, tumorspheres were smaller and displayed a
disrupted and irregular morphology in all cell types (4H
and 5H models) (Figure 6B & Supplementary Figure
S5A-5B). Both drugs were able to induce apoptosis in
tumorsphere cells as shown by PARP apoptotic cleavage
induction both in situ (Figure 6C) or at protein level
(Figure 6D). In any case, EC-8042 was much more
efficient than doxorubicin in reducing the cell viability
of tumorsphere cultures in all the studied sarcoma TICs
(Figure 6E-6H). These results support that, in contrast

EC-8042 eliminates CSC subpopulations in vitro
To test whether EC-8042 may affect CSC
subpopulations, we assayed the ability of the drugs to
inhibit the formation of clonal spheres (tumorspheres)
in nonadherent and serum free culture conditions
(Figure 5A) [33]. EC-8042 efficiently reduced the

to doxorubicin, EC-8042 could constitute an effective
treatment to eliminate CSC subpopulations in sarcoma.

untreated tumor samples (Figure 8A–8B). Moreover, all of
the tumors of the control and doxorubicin series displayed
a necrotic central area associated to their aggressive
growth pattern, and the appearance of this necrotic area
is largely prevented by EC-8042 treatment (Figure 8A
& 8C). Therefore, tumors treated with EC-8042 showed
a significant reduction in tumor grade according to the
score obtained by applying the three-grade FNCLCC
system which depend on the necrosis, mitotic counts
and differentiation status of the tumors (Figure 8D).
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed a decrease of
C-MYC nuclear and cytosolic expression in EC-8042
treated tumors which did not reach statistical significance
(Figure 8A & 8E). Likewise, in line with the observed
increase in adipogenic differentiation, EC-8042 produced
an increase in the expression of C/EBPα (Figure 8A &
8F), which is in any case much more modest than that
observed in TICs cultures. In addition, only doxorubicin
treatment induced a significant increment in apoptotic cell
death (cleaved-PARP staining) (Figure 8A & 8G). The fact
that EC-8042-treated tumors showed a great reduction
in the mitotic index suggest that this drug could induce
a senescent-like state associated to a permanent cellcycle arrest, as previously observed for other anti-tumor
drugs [34, 35]. To test this possibility, we disaggregated
and placed-back in culture four different tumors from
each group and we analyze senescence-associated
β-galactosidase in these ex vivo-established cell lines.
Cultures derived from EC-8042-treated tumors showed
a pronounced increase in size characteristic of senescent
cells and a large and significant increase in the fraction of
β-galactosidase positive cells (Figure 8H). Furthermore,
immunohistochemical analysis showed a highly increased
expression of P16-INK4A, a key regulator of cellular
senescence, in EC-8042-treated tumors (Supplementary
Figure S7). Taken together, these results indicate that the
in vivo sarcoma growth inhibition induced by EC-8042 is
due to the induction of a senescent-state, while the antitumor effects of doxorubicin are mainly caused by the
promotion of apoptotic cell death.

EC-8042 inhibits the growth of MLS xenografts
through the induction of a senescent-like state
EC-8042 treatment induced a profound tumor
growth inhibition in MLS xenografts originated from
T-5H-FC#1 cells (Figure 7 & Supplementary Figure S6).
A reduction in tumor growth was observed early during
the treatment and highly significant differences in tumor
volume and luminiscence levels between control and EC8042-treated tumors were observed as soon as 5-8 days
after the beginning of the treatment (Figure 7A–7B). At
the end-point, two different experiments displayed TGI
percentages of 61.4 and 76.42% respectively, and showed
highly significant differences in survival (Figure 7A
& 7C and Supplementary Figure S6). Likewise, tumor
weights in the control series almost triplicated those of
the EC-8042-treated series at the end of the experiment
(Figure 7D). On the other hand, doxorubicin treatment
showed lower antitumor activity compared to EC-8042
and resulted toxic at the later time points (Figure 7E). To
examine the ability of drugs to target CSC subpopulations
in vivo, we harvested xenograft tumors after a single high
dose (50 mg/Kg) treatment of EC-8042 or doxorubicin and
dissociated them into single cells to evaluate their selfrenewal and tumor re-initiation ability. A non-significant
reduction in tumorshpere formation was observed in
EC-8042-treated tumors (Figure 7F). More importantly,
EC-8042 produced a delay in tumor formation after reimplantation of tumor cells in limiting dilution assays. We
initially (week 3) observed a 4-fold significant decrease
of TIF in EC-8042- versus control-treated tumors (Figure
7G). Although eventually (week 5) tumor growth was
detected in nearly all mice (13 out of 15 in control and
EC-8042 groups and 12 out of 12 in doxorubicin group),
tumor weights in the EC-8042 group were significantly
lower than in control group (Figure 7H). These data
suggest that EC-8042 is able to partially reduce CSCs
subpopulations in vivo.
Intra-tumor pharmacokinetic measurement of EC8042 concentration at 24h and 48h after 50 mg/kg single
dose treatment indicated that the drug accumulated at
doses higher that those deemed active in vitro: 1640 ± 105
ng/g (media ± standard deviation) at 24h and 412 ± 267
ng/g at 48h. This high dose treatment of EC-8042 is below
the single maximum tolerated dose [17] and was able
to produce tumor regression in a lung cancer xenograft
model (unpublished data).
Histological examination of tumors showed that,
in comparison with control tumors, EC-8042-treated
tumors presented more extended areas of myxoid pattern
and increased adipogenic differentiation (Figure 8A). In
addition, both doxorubicin and especially EC-8042 treated
tumors presented significantly lower mitotic counts than

DISCUSSION
In this work, we aimed to find new targeted
therapies against soft tissue sarcomas using a model of
sarcomagenesis in which, UPS or MLS arise from the
cell-of-origin targeted with oncogenic mutations relevant
for sarcoma development [3, 25, 36]. In search for
altered transcription factor-mediated signaling, we found
that SP1 is the most significantly altered transcription
regulator in this model. Notably, a pro-tumorigenic role
for SP TFs has been reported in several types of soft
tissue sarcomas. Thus, SP1, SP3 and SP4 have been
found overexpressed in rhabdomyosarcoma cells and
fibrosarcoma-forming transformed human fibroblasts,
and its downregulation using tolfenamic acid, reactive

oxygen species (ROS)-inducing anticancer agents or
specific siRNAs/U1snRNAs resulted in inhibited tumor
growth [6, 8, 37, 38]. To inhibit the activity of SP1 and
other SP family members in sarcoma TICs we have used
a newly developed mithralog which shows a potent anti-

tumor activity while being less toxic than MTM and other
mithralogs [17]. EC-8042 induced strong anti-proliferative
effects that can be reproduced by SP1 knockdown using
RNA interference. This data suggest that the inhibition of
this transcription factor is a relevant mechanism of action

for EC-8042, as previously demonstrated for some ROSinducing drugs [38].
Importantly, we proved that this compound, EC-8042,
is not recognized as a substrate by transporters of the ABC
family. Several studies reported that SP1 and SP3 regulated
the expression of ABC family member genes in different
types of cancer cells, and that inhibition of SP1 activity
with MTM downregulated the expression of ABC family
genes and CSC-associated genes, inhibited proliferation
and tumorigenicity, suppressed CSC-associated properties
and caused chemosensitization to anti-cancer drugs [28,
29, 39-41]. Similarly, we show that SP1 inhibition using
EC-8042 results in the downregulation of ABCG2, ABCB1
and ABCC1. In addition, EC-8042, opposite to doxorubicin,
repressed the expression of many genes involved in the
development of the CSC phenotype.
The amplification of C-MYC , one of the oncogenic
genes with enhanced expression in our model of
sarcomagenesis, is a frequent event in many types
of sarcoma, including MLS [42]. EC-8042 treatment
downregulates the expression of this oncogene in our
model, in line with that described in ovarian cancer
cells [20]. C-MYC may be regulated independently of
SP1 by several anti-cancer drugs [38]. We showed that
siRNA-mediated knockdown of SP1 induced C-MYC
downregulation, suggesting that EC-8042 effect on
C-MYC expression is mediated by SP1. In addition,
genes involved in NOTCH signaling display a striking
differential regulation after EC-8042 and doxorubicin
treatments. In a similar way, the expression of the
Hedgehog signaling receptor PTCH1 is repressed by
EC-8042 but stimulated by doxorubicin. Importantly,
both NOCHT and Hedgehog signaling routes have been
found activated in CSC subpopulations of UPS, and their
inhibition reduced the proportion of cells displaying CSC
properties and suppressed tumor self-renewal [43].
The anti-tumor effect of EC-8042 in this model of
sarcomagenesis was associated to a stronger reduction
of the mitotic index, the induction of adipogenic
differentiation, the initiation of a senescent-like state and
the ability to target CSCs. Notably, senescence bypass
in MSCs have been suggested as plausible mechanism
for sarcoma development and therefore, senescence
induction therapy could represent an efficient strategy
against sarcoma [44]. Altogether, these data suggest that
EC-8042 could act as an anti-pluripotency therapy able to
target both CSCs and non-CSCs populations derived from
sarcoma TICs.

the last 3 months. All the cell types were cultured as
previously described [45]. Luciferase-expressing T-5HFC#1 cells were generated as described in Supplemental
Information. Gene expression profiling of some of
these cell types was previously reported and deposited
(GSE48030; [25]). Analysis of upstream transcription
regulator signaling significantly altered in transformed
hBMSCs as compared to wt hBMSCs was performed
with the list of differentially expressed genes (p value
<0.05; regulation ≤2-fold) using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) software 8.0 (Ingenuity Systems, Inc.,
Redwood City, CA). Stocks of EC-8042 and Doxorubicin
(Sigma, St Louis, MO) were prepared as 1 mM solutions
in sterile DMSO for in vitro experiments, maintained at
-20 °C, and brought to the final concentration just before
use. For in vivo experiments, EC-8042 and doxorubicin
were prepared in sterile saline solution. All experimental
protocols have been performed in accordance to approved
institutional review board guidelines and were approved
by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Hospital
Universitario Central de Asturias.

RT-qPCR assays
The expression of SP1, C-MYC, XIAP, ABCB1,
ABCG2 and ABCC1 was assessed by qPCR as described
in Supplemental Information. Primer sequences used are
shown in Supplementary Table S1.
The Human Cancer Stem Cells RT2 Profiler PCR
Array (PAHS-176-Z; SABiosciences, Qiagen Iberia,
Madrid, Spain) was used to analyze the expression of
84 genes linked to CSCs properties according to the
manufacturer instructions (Supplemental Information;
Supplementary Table S2). The analysis of altered signaling
associated to genes affected by EC-8042 was performed
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software 8.0
(Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA).

Western blot
Whole cell protein extraction and western blot
analysis were done as previously described [45].
Antibodies used are described in Supplemental
Information.

siRNA transfection
SP1-especific siRNAs were from Sigma (siSP1#1;
HU-01823-1) and from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO)
(siSP1#2; J-026959-05-0002). siGenome RiSCFree control siRNA (siControl; D-001220-01) were
from Dharmacon. siRNA sequences are shown in
Supplementary Table S1. Cells were transfected with
100 pmol/ml siRNAs using Lipofectamine 3000
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 48 or 72 hours after transfection, cells were
collected and analyzed [46].

permeabilized in PBS plus 0.1 % triton X-100 (Sigma)
for 20 minutes, washed another 5 times with PBS and
incubated with the blocking solution (10% goat serum in
PBS) for 1 hour. After that, tumorspheres were incubated
with anti-cleaved PARP [(ab32064), 1:500 dilution] from
Abcam (Cambridge, UK) for 24 hours, washed 4 times
with PBS plus 0.1% Tween-20 for 10 minutes, incubated
with Alexa-555-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG [(A-21422),
1:300 dilution] from Life Technologies for 1 hour, washed
another 4 times with PBS plus 0.1% tween at 4 ºC and
finally incubated with 300 ng/ml DAPI (Sigma) in PBS for
24 hours at 4 ºC. The slides were washed extensively with
PBS and pipetted into a drop of ProLong® Gold Antifade
Mountant medium (P36930) from Life Technologies
deposited in µ-Slide 8-well chambered coverslips (80826)
from Ibidi (Planegg, Germany). Confocal sections images
obtained with identical exposure times were collected
using an Ultra-Spectral TCS-SP2-AOBS confocal
microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).

The assessment of the ability of EC-8042 and
MTM to inhibit ACBB1/MDR1 and ABCG2/BCRP1 or
to be a substrate for these transporters were performed by
Absorption Systems (Exton, PA) using MDR1- or BCRPexpressing MDCK cells as described in Supplemental
Information.

Cell viability assays
The viability of all cell lines in the presence
and absence of drugs was determined using the Cell
Proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) (Supplemental Information).

Tumorsphere culture
Cells lines or dissociated xenografts were plated at a
density of 5,000 cells per well in 6-well plates treated with
a sterile solution of poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (10
g/l in 95% ethanol; Sigma) to prevent cell attachment, in
serum-free sphere medium containing DMEM-F12 (GE
Healthcare, Pittsburg, PA) supplemented with Glutamax
(1:100; Life Technologies), B-27 Supplement (1:50; Life
Technologies), Heparin (1:1000; Sigma), the growth
factors human EGF (20 ng/ml) and human bFGF (10 ng/
ml; PeproTech, London, UK) and 1% methylcellulose
(Sigma) to avoid cell aggregation. In addition, fresh
aliquots of EGF and bFGF were added every three days.
In xenograft-derived experiments, well-rounded spheres
formed after 10 days of culture were counted. To analyze
the effects of drugs in vitro, we treated adherent cultures
with increasing concentrations of drugs for 72 h and
then we grew them in tumorsphere culture conditions
to assay the ability of the drugs to inhibit the formation
of tumorespheres. Alternatively, 10-days spheres
were incubated in sphere medium containing different
concentrations of EC-8042 and doxorubicin for 4 days.
After that, tumorspheres were scored, recovered by
filtration through 70-μm cell strainers (Corning, New York,
NY), washed with PBS and disaggregated by incubation
with trypsin (0.25%)/EDTA (Life Technologies) for
15 min. The resulting cell suspension was pelleted and
resuspended in 1ml of normal growth medium containing
10% FBS (Life Technologies). 150 μl of these cells
suspensions were plated in triplicates in 96 well plates
and incubated overnight to allow their attachment. Finally,
cell viability was determined using the Cell Proliferation
reagent WST-1 as above.

Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle analysis of floating and adherent cells
was carried out as described previously [46].

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining
Cells were fixed and incubated overnight with X-gal
solution (pH 6.0) as previously described [35].

Xenograft experiments
Female NOD/SCID mice of 5-6 weeks old
(Janvier Labs, St Berthevin, France) were inoculated
subcutaneously (s.c.) with 1x106 T5H-FC#1 cells. Once
tumors reached 200-500 mm3, the mice were randomly
assigned to receive intra-venous (i.v.) treatments of
saline solution (control), EC-8042 at a dose of 18 mg/
kg every 3 days or doxorubicin at 6 mg/kg every 7 days.
Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation when the
tumors reached approximately 2 cm. Mean tumor volume
differences between groups were determined using a
caliper or measuring the luminescence intensity using
an IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton,
MA) (Supplemental Information). The student t test
was performed to determine the statistical significance
between control and treated groups. Survival was
represented using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the logrank test to estimate significant differences among groups
(PAST 3.01 software). Drug efficacy was expressed
as the percentage tumor growth inhibition (%TGI)
(Supplemental Information). Upon tumor removal,
a portion of some of the tumors was mechanically
disaggregated to establish ex-vivo tumor cell lines as
described [47]. In experiments aimed to analyze CSCs
subpopulations after treatments, a single dose of EC-8042
(50 mg/kg) or doxorubicin (8 mg/kg) were inoculated 48

Immunofluorescence staining
Tumorspheres cultures were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 20 minutes.
Tumorspheres were then washed 3 times with PBS,

into single cell suspensions using MACS Tissue
Dissociation Kit and the GentleMACS Dissociator
system (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).
Mouse cells were removed from cell suspensions using
Mouse Cell Depletion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). For limiting
dilution assays, serially diluted numbers of viable cells
dissociated from xenografts were injected s.c. Tumor
growth initiation was monitored for 5 weeks and tumorinitiating frecuency (TIF) was calculated using the
ELDA software [48]. Drug accumulation in tumors was
analyzed as described in Supplemental Information. All
animal research protocols were approved by the Animal
