MEK1/2 Inhibitors AS703026 and AZD6244 May Be Potential
Therapies for KRAS Mutated Colorectal Cancer That Is
Resistant to EGFR Monoclonal Antibody Therapy
Juyong Yoon, Kyoung-Hwa Koo, and Kang-Yell Choi

Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are used widely to treat metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients, but it is now clear that patients harboring K-ras mutation are resistant to
EGFR mAbs such as cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix). For this reason, current recommendations for patient care involve diagnosing the K-ras mutational status of patients prior to EGFR mAb therapy. In
this study, we investigated the ability of two MEK inhibitors currently in clinical trials, AS703026 and AZD6244,
to address the challenge posed by the resistance of K-ras mutated colorectal cancers to EGFR mAb. AS703026
and AZD6244 were tested in various cell-based assays and tumor xenograft studies, focusing on isogenic human
colorectal tumor cell lines that expressed only WT or mutant K-Ras (D-WT or D-MUT). The EGFR mAb
cetuximab inhibited the Ras-ERK pathway and proliferation of D-WT cells in vitro and in vivo, but it did not
inhibit proliferation of D-MUT cells in either setting. In contrast, AS703026 and AZD6244 effectively inhibited the
growth of D-MUT cells in vitro and in vivo by specific inhibition of the key MEK downstream target kinase ERK.
Inhibition of MEK by AS703026 or AZD6244 also suppressed cetuximab-resistant colorectal cancer cells
attributed to K-ras mutation both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings offer proof-of-concept for the use of
MEK inhibitors as an effective therapy in K-ras mutated CRC. Cancer Res; 71(2); 445–53. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is a commonly diagnosed malignancy and
a major cause of cancer-related death (1, 2). During the past
decade, the median overall survival time for patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has increased from 12 to
21 months, primarily due to chemotherapy with oxaliplatin,
irinotecan, and 5-fluorouracil (3). Newly developed molecular
targeted therapies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such
as cetuximab (Erbitux), panitumumab (Vectibix), trastuzumab (Herceptin), and Bevacizumab (Avastin) have provided
clinically meaningful benefits in treating colorectal cancer (4–
6). Most novel therapies have developed by targeting the
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal
growth factor (EGF) signaling involving angiogenesis and
proliferation of cancer cells.
As many human cancers, including colorectal cancer,
involve abnormal expression of EGF receptor (EGFR), which
is implicated in the development and prognosis of malignancy,
EGFR is a rational molecular target for cancer treatment (7).

However, the benefit from anti-EGFR mAb therapy using
cetuximab and panitumumab is limited to only a small
portion (823%) of patients. The patients with mCRC bearing
K-ras activating mutation are resistant to EGFR mAb therapy
(8–12). In July 2009, the FDA recommended that the K-Ras
gene mutational status of mCRC patients be screened prior to
treatment with EGFR mAb to avoid wasting time and disbursement (13).
Most K-ras mutations occur in the mid-adenoma stages in
the colorectal tumorigenesis (14). Ras activation stimulates
cell proliferation via the Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3 kinase-Akt
pathways, which involves development of carcinoma (15–17).
Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR, and its
binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR prevents ligand
binding and inhibits signaling cascades, such as the Ras-RafMEK-ERK and PIK3CA-Akt pathways (18). Considering the
epistasis of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade, we hypothesized
that MEK inhibition may overcome cetuximab resistance
attributed to K-ras mutations in some colorectal cancers.
To investigate the sensitivity of cetuximab resistance
dependent on K-ras mutation in cells and tumors, we used
isogenic DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell lines (D-WT and DMUT) in which wild-type (WT) and mutant K-Ras alleles have
been inactivated by homologous recombination (19). These
cell lines share the same genetic background with the exception of 1 base pair of codon 13 in the K-Ras gene. Considering
intact DLD-1 cells that are heterozygous for K-Ras, this paired
colorectal cell line provides an ideal system to distinguish the
responsiveness of a drug against K-ras mutation. In this study,

we address the effect of K-ras mutation on the responsiveness
of colorectal cancer cells to cetuximab using D-WT and DMUT cells and tumors. We further evaluated the effect of MEK
inhibition on the responsiveness of the D-WT and D-MUT cell
lines using 2 MEK1/2 inhibitors, AS703026 and AZD6244,
which are currently undergoing clinical trial-phase I and phase
II, respectively (20, 21). We observed that the MEK inhibitors
are effective in inhibiting tumor cell growth on the D-MUT
cells harboring a K-ras mutation both in vitro and in vivo, in
contrast to cetuximab. The MEK inhibitors reduced activities
of the ATF2 transcription factors which were also not
affected by cetuximab in K-ras mutated tumors. This study,
based on the recent clinical observations related to cetuximab
resistance (8–11, 22), is a pioneering study to investigate
the responsiveness of an EGFR mAb to a K-ras mutation
using isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines and their xenograft
models.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
The antibodies used in this study were anti–b-catenin (BD
Bioscience); Pan-Ras (Upstate Biotechnology); a-tubulin (Calbiochem); p-ERK, p-ATF2 (T71) (Cell Signaling Technology); pAkt, PCNA, b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-rabbit
AlexaFlour 488 and anti-mouse AlexaFlour 555 (Invitrogen).
Bromodeoxyuridine (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, BrdU) was purchased from DAKO. Cetuximab (Erbitux) and AS703026 were
provided by Merck KGaA. AZD6244 was obtained from
OTAVA.
Cell culture
Human colorectal cancer cell lines with either wild-type (DWT) or mutated K-Ras (D-MUT) were kindly provided by Dr.
Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore,
MD) in 2009. These cell lines are derived from DLD-1 human
colon cancer cell in which the endogenous wild-type or
mutant alleles had been inactivated through targeted homologous recombination (19). D-WT and D-MUT cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin at 37 C. Cells were checked by morphology and were
tested to be Mycoplasma-free using MycoFluor Mycoplasma
Detection Kit (Invitrogen) within the last 6 months. D-WT and
D-MUT cells were authenticated by mutational analysis of KRas, as described below.
Mutational analysis of K-ras
For mutational analysis of K-ras, total genomic DNA was
extracted from D-WT and D-MUT cells using the QIAamp DNA
Mini kit (QIAGEN). DNA (50 ng) were amplified in a 20 mL
reaction mixture containing 2 mL 10x buffer (Roche), 1.7 to 2.5
mmol/L MgCl2, 0.3 mmol/L each primer pair (codon 12, 13, F: 50 TTATGTGTGACATGTTCTAAT-30 , R: 50 -AGAATGGTCCTGCACCAGTAA-30 codon 61, F: 50 -TCAAGTCCTTTGCCCATTTT-30 , R: 50 -TGCATGGCATTAGCAAAGAC-30 ), 250 mmol/L
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 2.5 units of DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). Amplification was carried out using a

5-minute initial denaturation at 94 C, followed by 30 cycles of 1
minute at 94 C, 1 minute at 55 C, and 1 minute at 72 C, and a
10-minute final extension at 72 C. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and gelpurified with a QIAgen gel extraction kit (QIAGEN) before
being subjected to DNA sequencing analysis.
MTT assay and BrdU incorporation
Cells were plated at a density of 4104 cells per 24 well
and treated with MEK inhibitor, AS703026 or AZD6244
with/without cetuximab for 72 hours. MTT reagent
[3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; AMRESCO, Solon, OH] was diluted in RPMI 1640 at a
concentration of 0.25 mg/mL. Cells were incubated for 3 hours
at 37 C. Media was removed and insoluble purple formazan
was solubilized with 500 mL DMSO for 30 minutes. The
absorbance of formazan product was determined at 500 nm.
For In vitro BrdU labeling, cells were treated with 20 mmol/L
BrdU for 4 hours. Cell were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 minutes and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes.
Then, cells were blocked by 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
and 1% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS for 30 minutes and
incubated with anti-BrdU antibody (1:200), overnight at 4 C,
followed by incubation with anti-mouse Alexa Flour 555 secondary antibody, and counterstained by DAPI (Boehringer
Mannheim), and then mounted in Gel/Mount media (Biomeda
Corporation). Visualization of fluorescence signal was done
using confocal microscopy (LSM510, Carl-Zeiss) at excitation
wavelengths of 488 nm (Alexa Fluor 488), 543 nm (Alexa Fluor
555), and 405nm (DAPI). Each experiment was repeated 3
times. Data are given as mean  SD.
Foci formation assay
D-WT and D-MUT cells were seeded at a density of 500 cells
in each well of 6-well plates. The cells were treated with MEK
inhibitor, AS703026 or AZD6244 with/without cetuximab at
every 3 days for 7 (D-MUT) or 14 (D-WT) days. Media was
changed every 3 days. After 7 (D-MUT) or 14 (D-WT) days, cells
were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol.
Ras activation assay and immunoblotting
Cells were lysed with 2% Triton X-100, 100 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5), 200 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate, mammalian cell protease inhibitor
mixture, and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000g, for 5
minutes at 4 C. Aliquots of lysates were to allow quantification of total Pan-Ras, a-tubulin, p-ERK, p-Akt, ERK by immunoblotting. The remainder of cell lysates was incubated with
bead coated with fusion protein (GST-Raf1-RBD; Upstate
Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 C for 1 hour. Beads were washed
3 times with cold lysis buffer, and bounded protein was eluted
with 4x laemmli sample buffer at 100 C for 5 minutes and
analyzed by immunoblotting for Ras.
Mouse xenograft assay
This animal study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of
Medicine. Approximately 4–6-week-old male Balb C nu/nu

mice were purchased from Slc Inc. Mice were housed in filtertopped shoebox cages with a MSRS environmental control
system from Orient Biotech. Room temperature was maintained at 24 C with a relative humidity of approximately 40%
to 70%. The mice were given a standard maintenance diet
from Dae Han Bio Link. After acclimatization for 1 week,
5106 D-WT or MUT cells in 200 mL of PBS: Matrigel (1:1) were
subcutaneously injected to dorsal flank of athymic nude mice.
When the mean values of tumor were between 100 and 200
mm3, mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (5 mice per
group). Cetuximab was treated to mice intraperitonially at
dose of 1 mg/mice, twice a week. AS703026 and AZD6244, in a
suspension of 0.5% methyl cellulose and 0.4% Tween 80, were
injected by oral gavages once and twice daily at dosage of 10
mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively. Tumor volume and body
weight of mice were measured every 4 days. Tumor volumes
were measured by Verniar calipers, following the formula of
p/6  length  width  height. Animals were euthanatized
when tumor volume exceeded 1,500 mm3. For in vivo BrdU

labeling, mice were injected intraperitonially with 100 mg/kg
BrdU 4 hours before sacrifice. Twenty-eight days after treatment mice were sacrificed and tumors were excised and
weighed and then fixed in paraformaldehyde or snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen for further analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical analysis, 4 mm paraffin sections
were treated with 0.1% triton X-100 in PBS for 15 minutes and
then block by 5% BSA and 1% NGS in PBS for 30 minutes.
Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted with 1% BSA
and 1% NGS in PBS. The primary antibody was omitted for
negative control slides, which resulted in very low background

Results
D-MUT colorectal cancer cells are resistant to
cetuximab due to K-ras mutation
Cells retaining endogenous WT K-Ras (D-WT) and cells
with a mutant allele of K-ras (D-MUT) in the genetic background of DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells (19) were adopted to
study the sensitivity of anticancer drugs dependent on the
mutational status of K-ras. DNA sequencing analysis confirmed the mutational status of K-ras in D-WT and D-MUT
cells. (Supplementary Fig. S1). To determine responsiveness of
EGFR mAb on K-ras mutation, D-WT and D-MUT cells
expressing high level of EGFR were treated with cetuximab
at every 24 hours for 72 hours. The proliferation of cells was
measured by MTT analysis at 24, 48, and 72 hours after
cetuximab treatment. As expected, D-MUT cells harboring
mutated K-ras clearly showed resistance to cetuximab,
whereas proliferation of the isogenic D-WT cells harboring
WT K-Ras was suppressed by cetuximab (Fig. 1A). D-WT cell

448

growth was inhibited by 30% after cetuximab treatment as
revealed by MTT analysis, whereas D-MUT cell growth was
unchanged after 72 hours of treatment. To investigate the
efficacy of cetuximab in vivo, mouse xenograft models were
produced by injecting either D-WT or D-MUT cells subcutaneously into the dorsal flank of athymic nude mice. In the DWT xenograft model, administration of cetuximab at dosage
of 1 mg/mice twice a week for 8 weeks significantly reduced
tumor size and tumor weight by 50% (Fig. 1B and 1C). In
contrast, D-MUT tumors treated with cetuximab did not show
a reduction in either volume (Fig. 1B) or weight (Fig. 1C) of
tumors by the cetuximab therapy. Immunohistochemical
analyses were done to confirm the effect of cetuximab on
D-WT or D-MUT xenograft tumors (Fig. 1D). Positive staining
for p-ERK was observed specifically around tumor borders,
where a relatively nonhypoxic condition is maintained. Therefore, all images were obtained from these regions. The p-ERK
staining was decreased in D-WT tumors treated with cetuximab, but was unaffected in D-MUT xenograft tumors with the
same treatment (Fig. 1D). The staining patterns for PCNA, a
proliferation marker, were similar to that of p-ERK, revealing
that proliferation of both D-WT and D-MUT tumors correlate
with activation status of the ERK pathway (Fig. 1D). b-catenin,
as a negative control of staining, did not show any significant
change by treatment of cetuximab (Fig. 1D).

D-MUT cells every 24 hour for 72 hours in combination with either 10 mmol/L AS703026 (A) or 50 mmol/L AZD6244 (B). MTT assays were done at 24, 48,
and 72 hours after drug treatments. C and D, D-WT and D-MUT cells were treated for 24 hours with DMSO (control) or 5 mg/mL cetuximab in combination
with either 10 mmol/L AS703026 (C) or and 50 mmol/L AZD6244 (D). Then BrdU was added at a final concentration of 20 mmol/L for 4 hours, and cells
were fixed, permeabilized, incubated with anti-BrdU mAb, and finally incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa 555 secondary antibodies. Cell nuclei were
counterstained with DAPI. Cells were visualized by a laser scanning confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM510). The percentage of BrdU-positive cells was
calculated from the total number of DAPI-stained cells (bottom), and error bars indicate the standard deviations of 3 independent analyses. Original
magnification: C, 400; D, 200.

AS703026 and AZD6244 inhibit ERK pathway,
proliferation, and transformation in cetuximabresistant D-MUT cells
MEK inhibitors currently in clinical development, AS703026
and AZD6244 (Fig. 2A), which act downstream of K-Ras, were
tested for their ability to overcome cetuximab resistance in DMUT cells. In D-WT cells, cetuximab inhibited ERK activity by
reducing GTP loading of Ras (Fig. 2B and C). In D-MUT cells,
cetuximab did not reduce GTP loading of Ras or ERK activity
attributed to the K-ras mutation (Fig. 2B and C). When D-MUT
cells were also treated with AS703026 or AZD6244 (Fig. 2B and
C), ERK activity was reduced, but no combination effect was
observed. The inhibitory effect of 10 mmol/L AS703026 on ERK
activity was higher than that of 50 mmol/L AZD6244 (Fig. 2B
and C). The alternative MEK inhibitor U0126 showed identical
effect on ERK activity (Supplementary Fig. S2). No significant
change of Akt activity was observed when cetuximab,
AS703026, or AZD6244 treated to both D-WT and D-MUT
cells (Fig. 2B and C).

www.aacrjournals.org

Effects of AS703026 and AZD6244 on cellular proliferation
were measured using MTT and BrdU incorporation assays
(Fig. 3). Treatment with cetuximab alone reduced proliferation
of D-WT but not of D-MUT cells. Addition of AS703026 and
AZD6244 reduced proliferation in both D-WT and D-MUT cells
(Fig. 3A and B). When D-WT cells were treated with cetuximab,
BrdU incorporation was decreased by 54%–65%, but was unaffected in D-MUT cells. BrdU incorporation in D-WT cells was
reduced by 62.3% with the addition of AS703026 and by 67.2%
with AZD6244, and in D-MUT cells by 63.2% with AS703026 and
61.3% with AZD6244 (Fig. 3C and D). The anchorage-independent growth of D-WT cells was inhibited by cetuximab, and that
of D-MUT cells was not (Fig. 4A and B). Cellular transformation
was reduced for both D-WT and D-MUT by treatment with
AS703026 (Fig. 4A) or AZD6244 (Fig. 4B). However, no combination effects from treatment of cetuximab with either AS703026
or AZD6244 were observed in ERK activation, proliferation, or
transformation of cells, although BrdU incorporation in D-WT
cells did suggest combination effect (Fig. 3 and 4)

AS703026 and AZD6244 inhibit tumor growth of
cetuximab-resistant tumor attributed by K-ras
mutation
Antitumor effects of AS703026, AZD6244, and cetuximab
were measured using mouse tumor xenograft models. The
representative gross images for tumor on athymic mice bearing tumor are shown in Fig. 5A and B. Cetuximab treatment
did not reduce the size of D-MUT xenograft tumors (Fig. 5C
and D). However, both volume (Fig. 5C) and weight (Fig. 5E) of
tumors caused by D-MUT cells were reduced by 60% by
AS703026, and this correlates with the cell-based in vitro
studies. Treatment with AZD6244 showed a similar growth
inhibitory effect on tumor volume decreased by 71% (Fig. 5D)
and weight by 68% (Fig. 5F). In agreement with the cell studies,
no combination effect was observed when AS703026 or
AZD6244 (Fig. 5). We did not observe any statistically significant changes in body weight of mice used through the both
experiments (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Immunohistochemical analyses were done to confirm the
mechanisms of action of AS703026, AZD6244, and cetuximab
on D-MUT xenograft tumors (Fig. 6). In AS703026 and
AZD6244 administered D-MUT tumors, however, p-ERK staining decreased markedly (Fig. 6). The ATF2 activity monitored
by anti–p-ATF2 (T71) antibody was reduced by treatment of
AS703026 or AZD6244 in D-MUT tumors, indicating that ERK
activity inhibits the regulation of target genes (Fig. 6). The Akt
activity was not significantly reduced by cetuximab or MEK
inhibitor treatment in D-MUT tumors (Fig. 6). b-catenin did
not show any significant change by cetuximab therapy (Fig. 6).

Discussion
Since the first MEK inhibitor, PD98059 have been developed, other numerous MEK inhibitors have also been developed. Undesirable pharmaceutical properties or side effects

resulted in none of the early MEK inhibitors, including U0126
and RO 09–2210, progressing to clinical trials (23). By cellbased screening or modification from the original MEK inhibitor, 11 MEK inhibitors have entered clinical trials. CI-1040
(Pfizer) was the first MEK1/2 inhibitor to enter clinical trials
(21). Despite higher selectivity of CI-1040 to MEK1/2 inhibition, this drug has been disclosed after Phase II because of
insufficient antitumor activity, poor solubility, and low efficacy (21). A following clinical trial of a second generation
MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901 (Pfizer), an analogue of CI-1040,
was also stopped in phase II by severe toxicity including
blurred vision as well as neurotoxicity. Here, we investigated
the use of AS703026 (Merck Serono) and AZD6244 (AstraZeneca), which are in clinical trials, to check the effects of MEK1/
2 inhibition on K-ras mutated colorectal cancer (20, 21). The
results of the phase I and II studies of AZD6244 were reported
with evidence of only a single-agent antitumor activity in
patients with non–small cell lung cancer, advanced melanoma, or mCRC as well as lack of radiographic response in
patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (24–28). However, other phase II trials in a variety of
tumor types are currently in process (21).
AS703026 was most recently developed as a highly selective,
ATP noncompetitive allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor. Phase I
clinical trials of AS703026 are underway to test its inhibitory
effects on multiple solid tumors (29). Multiple myeloma (MM)
cells are inhibited by AS703026 regardless of Ras and BRAF
mutation when it is administered in combination with multiple conventional, novel, and emerging anti-MM therapies (30).
This study shows efficacy of both AZD6244 and AS703026 on
colorectal cancer with K-ras mutation. When ligands bind to
activate EGFR, both the ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways are
activated (18). Ras protein directly interacts with the p110
subunit of PI3K to activate Akt (31). Both ERK and PI3K-Akt
pathways are strongly implicated in cell proliferation and

survival (32). Combined therapy with MEK and PI3K inhibitors
had a synergistic inhibitory effect on non–small cell lung
cancer cells affected by the K-ras mutation (33). Our study
indicates that inhibitory effects of AS703026 and AZD6244 on
tumor volume in the xenograft assay did not abolish tumor
growth. We observed no inhibition of Akt activity by either
cetuximab or MEK inhibitor in D-MUT tumors due to oncogenic mutation of K-ras. Our results indicate the simultaneous
blockade of Ras-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways may be more
efficacious in the treatment of cancers attributed by K-ras
mutation. The recent announcement of a collaboration
between Merck and AstraZeneca to test combination cancer
therapy using MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (AstraZeneca) and Akt
inhibitor MK-2206 (Merck) further support importance of the
combinatory therapy related with ras mutation (21).
We observed that both AS703026 and AZD6244 increased
GTP-loading of Ras. This increment of GTP-loading of Ras
may be caused by desensitization of Ras activation through

www.aacrjournals.org

the disassociation of the Grb2-Sos complex by phosphorylating Sos (34). Our observation also correlates with the previous
report that MEK inhibition blocked phosphorylation and
dissociation of Sos from Grb2, resulting in prolonged Ras
activation (35). When AS703026 or AZD6244 were treated with
a combination of cetuximab, this negative feedback regulation
was thoroughly diminished by targeting EGFR, the upstream
signaling regulator.
Interestingly, new DNA synthesis of D-WT cells, monitored
by BrdU incorporation, was synergistically reduced by MEK
inhibitor and cetuximab although we did not observe the
synergy effects in the measurement of cellular transformation
by foci formation assay. The synergy effect observed in these
studies indicates that an alternative route for transmission of
proliferation signal is present only in the wild-type DLD-1 cells.
Somatic mutation of PI3K in the parent DLD-1 cells may not
allow transferring downstream signaling to Akt (36). Therefore,
PI3K-Akt pathway may not be involved in this synergistic effect.

Paraformaldehyde fixed paraffin
sections were incubated with anti–
p-ERK, p-Akt, p-ATF2, PCNA, or
b-catenin antibody, followed by
incubation with goat anti-mouse
Alexa 555 secondary antibodies.
Nuclei were counter stained by
DAPI. Images were captured from
nonhypoxic area and the tumor
borders using laser scanning
confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss
LSM510). Original magnification:

One potential route attributing the synergy effect may be the
pathway involving RalGDS. The RalGDS can directly interact
with GTP-bound active form of Ras protein through their Ras
binding domain (RBD) (37), and interaction between GTP-Ras
and RalGDS promote the translocation of RalGDS to the
plasma membrane where it activates Ral (38). The RalGDSRal pathway has been shown to be involved in regulation of
various transcription factors, such as Rlf, c-Jun, and ATF2, to
promote cell proliferation (39–41). In addition, RalGDS promote Akt activation by PDK1 as a scaffold protein (42).
Here, we used D-WT and D-MUT cell, the isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines, as pair. The usage of these cell lines
eliminates the possibility of partial effect by wild-type K-Ras
in K-ras mutated cancer cells, when compared with the
several previous trials related with therapeutic potential
of MEK inhibitors on various cancer cells (43–46). The data
indicate clear resistance to EGFR mAb in the K-ras mutated
cell line D-MUT, an advantage over most colorectal cancer
cells that have heterozygous K-ras mutations. The BRAF
inhibitor Sorafenib was previously suggested to overcome
the cetuximab resistance of K-ras mutated colorectal cancer,
although the study involved only an in vitro system (47). This
study provides in vivo evidence for the cetuximab resistance
of K-ras mutations and therapeutic strategy to overcome it
using xenograft tumor model of CRC harboring an isogenic
K-ras mutation. In the era of personalized medicine, our
results suggest that the paired isogenic colorectal cancer cell

can be used as a drug screening system to identify the
overcoming effect related with cetuximab resistance in Kras mutated colorectal cancer.
