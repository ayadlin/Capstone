Abstract
Emerging evidence suggests that cytotoxic therapy may actually promote drug resistance and metastasis while
inhibiting the growth of primary tumors. Work in preclinical models of breast cancer has shown that acquired
chemoresistance to the widely used drug paclitaxel can be mediated by activation of the Toll-like receptor TLR4 in
cancer cells. In this study, we determined the prometastatic effects of tumor-expressed TLR4 and paclitaxel
therapy and investigated the mechanisms mediating these effects. While paclitaxel treatment was largely
efﬁcacious in inhibiting TLR4-negative tumors, it signiﬁcantly increased the incidence and burden of pulmonary
and lymphatic metastasis by TLR4-positive tumors. TLR4 activation by paclitaxel strongly increased the
expression of inﬂammatory mediators, not only locally in the primary tumor microenvironment but also
systemically in the blood, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and lungs. These proinﬂammatory changes
promoted the outgrowth of Ly6Cþ and Ly6Gþ myeloid progenitor cells and their mobilization to tumors, where
they increased blood vessel formation but not invasion of these vessels. In contrast, paclitaxel-mediated
activation of TLR4-positive tumors induced de novo generation of deep intratumoral lymphatic vessels that
were highly permissive to invasion by malignant cells. These results suggest that paclitaxel therapy of patients
with TLR4-expressing tumors may activate systemic inﬂammatory circuits that promote angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and metastasis, both at local sites and premetastatic niches where invasion occurs in distal
organs. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that efforts to target TLR4 on tumor cells may simultaneously quell
local and systemic inﬂammatory pathways that promote malignant progression, with implications for how to
prevent tumor recurrence and the establishment of metastatic lesions, either during chemotherapy or after it is
completed. Cancer Res; 74(19); 5421–34. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Paclitaxel is a widely used drug for breast cancer treatment
with an overall response rate of 25% (1). The advanced paclitaxel formulation as albumin-embedded nanoparticles (nabpaclitaxel) increased the initial response rate to 42% (2);
however, resistance occurs frequently and the evasion
mechanisms remain unclear. Tumor recurrence occurs in
30% of node-negative and up to 70% in node-positive breast
cancer patients (3). Only 23% of relapsed patients survive 5
years after diagnosis mainly due to metastasis to lymph nodes

(LN) and distant organs (4). Several recent studies suggest that
paclitaxel (5, 6) both kills and activates tumor cells thereby
increasing chemoresistance and metastasis. The goal of this
study was to delineate the mechanisms underlying relapseassociated metastasis possibly driven by paclitaxel therapy.
Tumor resistance to paclitaxel is currently thought to be due
to either overexpression of transporters that decrease intracellular drug concentrations or preexisting mutations preventing drug binding to tubulin (7). We recently identiﬁed a novel
mechanism of chemoresistance to paclitaxel relating to its
activation of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4; ref. 8). TLR4 is
expressed mainly in the antigen-presenting cells that respond
to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of bacterial membrane (9). Macrophages activated by the LPS–TLR4 pathway
acquire the capacities to quickly migrate to an infected site,
protect themselves from pathogen toxicity, destroy invaders,
and restore homeostasis to the injured tissue (9). While these
TLR4-dependent macrophage functions are essential for body
defense, overexpression of TLR4 in tumor cells has deleterious
consequences due to acquisition of a migratory, toxicity-resistant, and "wound healing"-like phenotype. Albeit not universally recognized, TLR4 is often expressed and activated in
human cancers by the products of injured and dead cells
typically present in the tumor environment and particularly

increased after chemotherapy (10). In addition to endogenous
TLR4 ligands, this receptor is also activated by paclitaxel (11),
suggesting that this type of therapy can enhance recurrence
and metastasis in TLR4-positive tumors (5, 8).
This notion is strongly supported by multiple clinical
studies showing that TLR4 expression correlates with tumor
dedifferentiation (12), higher clinical stage (13), faster recurrence rates (14, 15), inﬁltration by inﬂammatory myeloid cells
(14), higher incidence of venous invasion (16), as well as
lymphatic and distant (14, 16, 17) metastasis. Tumor expression of TLR4 also correlates with shorter relapse-free and
overall survival in breast (14), colorectal (17), and pancreatic
(16) human cancers. Moreover, mechanistic studies in multiple cancer models showed that LPS activation of tumorexpressed TLR4 increases expression of angiogenic and
inﬂammatory factors (5, 18), immune evasion (18), cell survival (19), invasiveness (20), and metastatic spread (15). Studies in human ovarian cancer models were ﬁrst to show that
both LPS and paclitaxel cause signiﬁcant inﬂammation and
protection from cell death mediated by an intracellular adaptor of TLR4, MyD88 (5, 21). The latter is highly upregulated in
clinical ovarian cancer and strongly correlates with decreased
patient survival (22, 23). Knockdown of TLR4 restored sensitivity to paclitaxel (5, 21) and conferred a less metastatic
phenotype (24) compared with isogenic TLR4-rich tumors.
In line with this evidence, we recently reported that TLR4
overexpression in a negative breast cancer line HCC1806
substantially increased inﬂammation and chemoresistance to
paclitaxel therapy (8). Consistently, suppression of TLR4
expression in a positive MDA-MB-231 line signiﬁcantly
improved response to paclitaxel, resulting in a 6-fold increase
in the number of tumor-free mice (8). Here, we aimed to
delineate the mechanisms by which paclitaxel in conjunction
with TLR4 impairs tumor response to paclitaxel therapy.
Among various functional consequences of TLR4 activation,
we considered that LPS-activated macrophages rebuild vascular networks through recruitment of bone marrow progenitors (25). Extrapolating from that, we postulated that paclitaxel-driven TLR4 activation in tumor cells may recapitulate
this phenotype, leading to tumor recruitment of provascular
progenitors, increased vessel formation, and tumor spread.
To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effects of paclitaxel
therapy on inﬂammation, tumor vascularization, growth, and
metastasis in both syngeneic mouse and human breast cancer
models with differential expression of TLR4. We found that
paclitaxel increases local and systemic inﬂammation concomitant with expansion of tumor vascular networks, increases
lymphatic metastasis, and signiﬁcantly worsens outcome in
TLR4-positive tumors as compared with TLR4-negative or
untreated tumors. These ﬁndings suggest that blocking the
TLR4 pathway may restore sensitivity to paclitaxel therapy and
signiﬁcantly improve cancer patient survival.

Paclitaxel albumin-bound nanoparticles (nab-paclitaxel) were
obtained from a local hospital pharmacy.
Antibodies
Primary antibodies were rat anti-mouse CD11b, Ly6C, Ly6G
and MECA-32 (BioXCell, NH); rabbit anti-mouse Lyve-1 and
Prox1 (Angiobio); mouse anti-human HLA (ATCC); and PErabbit anti-mouse Ly6C (BD Bioscience). Anti–species-speciﬁc
secondary antibodies conjugated to 488, 549, and 650 dyes were
from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.
Cell lines
Luciferase-tagged human MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806 cell
lines were stably modiﬁed to either suppress or upregulate
TLR4 expression as described previously (8). Modiﬁed lines
and the corresponding controls were designated as 231TLR4þ
and 231TLR4 (derived from MDA-MB-231) or 1806TLR4 and
1806TLR4þ (HCC1806). MMTV-PyMT mouse breast cancer line
was generated in Dr. David DeNardo's laboratory. Other mouse
breast cancer lines were obtained from ATCC. All lines were
cultured in 5% DMEM with standard additives at 37 C in 10%
CO2. All human lines were authenticated by ATCC in 2013 and
tested for mycoplasma using a kit from R&D Systems.
Generation of dominant-negative TLR4 and MyD88 cell
lines
MDA-MB-231 cells were stably transfected with dominantnegative (DN)-TLR4 and DN-MyD88 using pZero-hTLR4a and
pdn-MyD88, respectively. Control lines were similarly generated using corresponding empty plasmids (pZero-MCS and
pDeNy-MCS) from InvivoGen.
Animal studies
Tumor growth was monitored as described previously
(8, 26). Brieﬂy, 4  106 (human) or 0.5  106 (mouse) cells
suspended in 50% Matrigel were implanted orthotopically into
4- to 6-week-old female SCID, C57BL/6, or BALB/c mice
(Taconic) followed by measurements 3 times a week using
digital calipers. When tumors reached 150 or 500 mm3, mice
were treated with 10 to 30 mg/kg nab-paclitaxel for 2 cycles of 5
consecutive days with 1 week rest between the cycles. Tumors,
serum, and organs were collected when tumors reached 1,800
mm3. Animal care was in accordance with institutional
guidelines.
Determination of metastatic burden
Tissues were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (Promega)
containing protease inhibitors. Luciferase substrate (50mL) was
mixed with lysates (10 mL) followed by luminescence detection
using a luminometer (Berthold). Extracts with luciferase activity
of 1,000 relative luciferase units (RLU)/s above background
were considered positive for metastasis. Data are expressed as
the mean RLU/s  SEM from duplicate readings normalized per
mg of total protein determined by Bradford assay.
qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted from tumors, lymph nodes, and lungs by
TRI reagent and reverse transcribed using RevertAid cDNA

Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). Primers were designed on the basis
of complementary DNA sequence of targets found in the NCBI
database. All primer sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table S1, and were validated to be human or mouse speciﬁc.
Transcripts were analyzed using GoTaq Green Master Mix
(Promega) and MasterCycle realplex PCR machine (Eppendorf). Data were normalized to b-actin, and relative changes in
mRNA expression were determined using the DDCt method.
Measurement of cytokine concentration by ELISA
Serum and tumor lysates were collected from tumor bearing
mice treated with sterile endotoxin-free saline or 10 to 30 mg/
kg of nab-paclitaxel and sacriﬁced on day 6 or 14 posttreatment. IL6, IL8, CCL2, and IL1b concentrations were measured
by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Peprotech). All experiments were performed in duplicate and
reproduced twice. Results are presented as mean pg  SD
normalized per mg of protein.
Measurement of spleen weight
Spleens were harvested from untreated or nab-paclitaxel
treated mice bearing 1806TLR4 or 1806TLR4þ tumors. Results
are presented as the mean spleen weight  SD for each group
(n ¼ 3–5 mice).
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed on whole bone marrow,
spleen-derived mononuclear cells, and CD11bþ cells from
tumors. Bone marrow was collected by ﬂushing the bones
with 2% FBS and 1 mmol/L EDTA in PBS. Spleen mononuclear
cells were obtained from a single-cell suspension followed by a
Ficoll–Paque gradient. Tumor-associated CD11bþ cells were
isolated using rat anti-CD11b magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec)
from digested tumors by 225 U/mL collagenase type III and 100
U/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich). After blocking Fc, cells
were incubated with anti-CD11b, Ly6C, and Ly6G for 30
minutes on ice followed by incubation with secondary 488and 650-conjugated anti-rat antibodies. Expression was analyzed using AccuriC6 ﬂow cytometer (BD Accuri Cytometers)
and FlowJo software. Results are expressed as mean% of
marker expression per group (n ¼ 5)  SEM.
Immunohistochemical analysis of blood vessels,
lymphatic vessels, and macrophages
Acetone-ﬁxed 8 mm thick frozen tumor sections were rehydrated in PBS with 0.1% Tween20 (PBST) before incubation with
anti-mouse CD11b, Ly6C, Ly6G, MECA-32, Lyve-1 diluted 1:100,
or w6/32 hybridoma supernatant used undiluted. All antibodies
were incubated with tissues for 1 hour at 37 C with a 10-minute
wash in PBST between incubations. After the last wash, slides
were mounted in VectaShield medium containing 4,60 -diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear stain (Vector Labs). Images were
acquired on an Olympus BX41 microscope equipped with a
DP70 digital camera and DP Controller software (Olympus).
Quantiﬁcation of stained cells
Images of six random ﬁelds were taken at 200 magniﬁcation from sections stained with anti-CD11b, -Ly6C, and -Ly6G.

www.aacrjournals.org

Images were analyzed by ImageJ software to determine ﬂuorescent intensity for individual pixels. The amount of pixels
acquired from positive staining was divided by the total pixels
per ﬁeld yielding the area-normalized% of positive staining
for each speciﬁc marker. The results are presented as mean
percent of marker expression per ﬁeld  SD (3 mice/group).
Quantiﬁcation of blood and lymphatic vessel densities
Blood vascular density (BVD) and lymphatic vessel density
(LVD) were determined from four images per slide captured
at 200 magniﬁcation in tumor sections stained with either
anti-MECA-32 or anti-Lyve-1 antibodies (3 mice/group). Vascular structures were enumerated using ImageJ. BVD is presented as the mean number of vessels per ﬁeld  SEM, and LVD
is the mean number of Lyve-1þ structures normalized per mm2
of the section area  SEM.
Quantiﬁcation of vascular invasion
Tumor sections were double-stained with anti-human HLA
and anti-mouse MECA-32 or Lyve-1 antibodies as described
above. Blood and lymphatic vessels with open lumens were
identiﬁed and enumerated in each section. The percentage of
open-lumen vessels invaded by tumor cells was normalized per
section area. Results are presented as the mean percentage of
invaded vessels from total open-lumen blood or lymphatic
structures normalized per section area  SD.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism software. Results are expressed as mean  SEM or
 SD. Statistical signiﬁcance for continuous variables
and categorical covariants was determined by the Student
paired t test and c2 test, respectively. Metastatic burden and
incidence was assessed by the Mann–Whitney and Fisher
exact tests, respectively. P values  0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
TLR4 expression in breast cancer cells dictates the
response to paclitaxel therapy and metastatic spread
We previously showed that paclitaxel elicits strong inﬂammatory responses and promotes tumor growth in TLR4-positive MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806 models, but not in isogenic
controls with low or no TLR4 expression (8). Here, we conﬁrmed that paclitaxel effect is largely mediated via TLR4
because MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing dominant-negative
(DN) TLR4 or its intracellular adaptor MyD88 had substantially lower responses to paclitaxel than vector-transfected controls (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also conﬁrmed that the
proinﬂammatory response is not restricted to nab-paclitaxel
as both Taxol (8) and docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S2)
similarly activate TLR4-positive tumor cells.
While our ﬁrst study (8) focused on the effects of TLR4
and paclitaxel therapy on growth and recurrence of primary
tumors, here we used the same breast cancer models to analyze the effects on metastasis. Lymph node and lung metastasis
was analyzed in mice with orthotopically implanted 231TLR4þ,

TLR4 and Paclitaxel Promote Metastasis

decreased the burden but failed to reduce 100% metastatic
incidence in mice with TLR4-expressing 231TLR4þ tumors. In
contrast, the same treatment of an isogenic model with 90%
depleted TLR4 drastically decreased both burden and incidence of lymph node and lung metastases (Figs. 1C, E, and G;
Supplementary Table S2).
The prometastatic role of TLR4 ampliﬁed by chemotherapy was even more pronounced in the HCC1806 model in
which nearly all treated mice (90%) with TLR4-positive
tumors were positive for lymph node and pulmonary metastases compared with less than half of the mice bearing
isogenic-negative tumors (Fig. 1D). Importantly, only in
1806TLR4þ tumors, nab-paclitaxel therapy increased the
burden of lymph node metastasis by 245-fold compared
with untreated controls (P ¼ 0.008; Supplementary Table
S2). Chemotherapy also increased pulmonary metastasis
by 12-fold in TLR4-positive and 5-fold in negative tumors
(Figs. 1F and H), suggesting that some oncogenic effects of
paclitaxel are TLR4 independent. Cumulatively, these results
show that paclitaxel activation of TLR4 in tumor cells
promotes tumor growth and metastasis, and that paclitaxel
therapy may result in a strikingly different outcome depending on expression of TLR4.
Paclitaxel in concert with TLR4 promotes local
inﬂammation in primary human xenografts
We next delineated the mechanisms by which TLR4 and
paclitaxel advance metastatic spread. TLR4 is the major
inducer of inﬂammation in injured or pathogen-attacked
tissues (27). We therefore hypothesized that nab-paclitaxel
activation of TLR4 promotes metastasis by increasing tumor
inﬂammation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the cytokine expression in untreated and nab-paclitaxel–treated TLR4negative and -positive tumors isolated 6 days posttreatment.
Tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT)PCR for expression of 15 inﬂammatory cytokines typically
upregulated by the TLR4 pathway (8). Chemotreatment of
mice with TLR4-negative tumors increased only a third of the
examined cytokines by 2- to 3-fold (Fig. 2A). In contrast,
treatment of mice with TLR4-positive tumors elevated 73.3%
of cytokines up to approximately 12-fold (Fig. 2B). This result
demonstrates that nab-paclitaxel induces a signiﬁcantly stronger inﬂammatory response in TLR4-positive tumors than those
lacking this receptor.
Remarkably, the mere expression of TLR4 in malignant
cells caused signiﬁcant proinﬂammatory changes in the
tumor environment as evident by highly increased levels
of IL6 (92.6-fold), IL10 (39.3-fold), and IL1b (16.4-fold) as
compared with TLR4-negative controls (Fig. 2C). This proinﬂammatory pattern was intensiﬁed by nab-paclitaxel
that further increased IL6 and IL1b by 276-fold and 57-fold,
respectively (Fig. 2D). Protein analysis by ELISA conﬁrmed
TLR4-dependent alterations in the inﬂammatory proﬁles
induced by paclitaxel (Figs. 2E–H). IL6 protein was undetectable in TLR4-negative tumors, but its expression increased to 56 pg/mg in TLR4-positive ones and ampliﬁed by
470% by nab-paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 2E). The changes in
IL8 expression mirrored this pattern with barely detectable

protein in TLR4-negative tumors and >10-fold upregulation in the TLR4-positive ones following nab-paclitaxel
treatment (Fig. 2G). The differences between TLR4-negative
and -positive tumors were maintained throughout the experiment as evident by highly expressed cytokines in the TLR4positive groups 2 weeks after treatment (Figs. 2F and H).
Taken together, these data indicate that paclitaxel activation of TLR4 substantially upregulates a wide range of cytokines, causing a sustained inﬂammatory state in the local
tumor environment that likely contributes to development
of metastasis.
Paclitaxel–TLR4 pathway increases inﬂammation and
metastasis in syngeneic mouse models
We then determined whether similar effects occur in
syngeneic mouse models having intact adaptive immunity.
We ﬁrst screened several breast cancer mouse lines in vitro
to identify lines positive for TLR4 and responsive to paclitaxel. We found that all examined lines (MMTV-PyMT,
4T1, 66.3, and EMT6) highly express TLR4 as well as all
major regulatory components of the TLR4 pathway (Fig. 3A
and B). MMTV-PyMT and EMT6 models were selected for
in vivo analysis. Both models showed similar increases in
intratumoral inﬂammatory cytokines after paclitaxel treatment (Figs. 3C and D) to those observed in human xenografts (Fig. 2). EMT6 tumors were also analyzed for the
effects on tumor growth and metastasis. Similarly to results
in human breast cancer models, nab-paclitaxel therapy
suppressed the growth of primary tumors (Fig. 3E), but
signiﬁcantly elevated metastasis (Fig. 3F). These data suggest that paclitaxel and TLR4 cause similar pro-oncogenic
and inﬂammatory changes in both human xenograft and
syngeneic mouse models.
Paclitaxel activation of tumor TLR4 also enhances
systemic inﬂammation
LPS-mediated activation of TLR4 increases systemic inﬂammation to alert distant organs of pathogen invasion and recruit
immune cells ﬁrst for body defense and, subsequently, for
tissue healing (28). We postulated that paclitaxel activation of
TLR4 in malignant cells mimics this pattern by increasing
inﬂammatory cytokines in the blood and distant organs
responsive to TLR4 systemic signals. To test this hypothesis,
we determined the proinﬂammatory effects of TLR4 and nabpaclitaxel on blood-circulating IL6 and IL8 and multiple cytokines in the main metastatic organs, i.e., lymph nodes and
lungs.
The results showed that paclitaxel activation of TLR4 signiﬁcantly changed the inﬂammatory milieu in both blood
and distant organs. Following treatment, levels of blood-circulating IL6 and IL8 proteins were highly increased in
TLR4-positive (but not negative) group from undetectable
to, correspondingly, 80 and 330 pg/mL (Fig. 4A–D). These
cytokines were derived from human tumor cells because
ELISA was performed using human-speciﬁc antibodies.
We also analyzed the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines in lymph nodes and lungs from untreated and nabpaclitaxel treated mice with TLR4-positive or -negative

primers validated on mouse and human universal cDNA
(Supplementary Table S1). Transcripts of human cytokines
were undetectable in distant organs; however, all groups
showed changes in mouse host cytokines that closely followed transcriptional alterations in primary tumors (Fig. 2).
In mice with TLR4-negative tumors, therapy caused a modest 2- to 3-fold increase in isolated lymph node cytokines. In
contrast, in mice with TLR4-positive tumors, 40% of the
examined lymph node cytokines increased by 4- to 8-fold.

Similarly, nab-paclitaxel did not affect lung cytokines in
mice with TLR4-negative tumors, but increased many cytokines 3- to 4-fold in mice with TLR4-positive tumors (Figs.
4G and H). CCL20, IL4, IL6, and IL10 were among the highest
upregulated in both lymph nodes and lungs. Collectively,
these data indicate that paclitaxel activation of TLR4 at
the primary tumor causes profound systemic changes in
expression of inﬂammatory mediators in the blood, lymph
nodes and lungs, the two main organs that permit growth of
metastatic breast cancer cells.

components of the TLR4 pathway. B, cell lines were treated with 30 nmol/L of nab-paclitaxel followed by qRT-PCR analysis of a panel of mouse

MMTV-PyMT or EMT6 cells. When tumors reached 200 mm , mice were treated with nab-paclitaxel (30 mg/kg) for 5 days. Tumors were
extracted on day 6 posttreatment and analyzed for expressions of inﬂammatory cytokines by ELISA. The most upregulated cytokines in MMTV-PyMT
(C) and EMT6 (D) models are shown. ELISA analysis was performed in duplicate and repeated twice. The data are expressed in ng normalized
per mg of total protein and each circle represents the average value for an individual mouse. The black bars indicate the mean cytokine concentration in

TLR4-mediated systemic inﬂammation increases
generation of myeloid progenitor cells in bone marrow
and spleen
TLR4-induced cytokines (e.g., IL1b, IL10, and IL6) have been
reported to induce generation of myeloid progenitors that
promote metastasis (29). As these cytokines were highly upregulated both locally and systemically by the TLR4–paclitaxel
axis, we hypothesized that their production enhances generation of myeloid progenitor cells in the distant organs such as

bone marrow and spleen. Indeed, the average spleen weight in
mice with TLR4-positive tumors was 300% larger than that in
mice bearing tumors lacking TLR4 (Fig. 5A and B). Moreover,
nab-paclitaxel treatment doubled spleen weight in mice with
1806TLR4þ tumors, making them 6-fold larger than in untreated
controls. Notably, spleens of mice with TLR4-negative tumors
were unchanged by chemotherapy (Fig. 5A and B).
We next determined whether the increase in spleen size
is due to generation of myeloid progenitors rather than

and Ly6Gþ cell recruitment showed a similar pattern. After
chemotherapy, 1806TLR4þ tumors recruited approximately 7fold more Ly6Cþ cells than TLR4-negative tumors (Figs. 6A and
C). Following this trend, paclitaxel treatment of 1806TLR4þ
tumors mobilized approximately 3-fold more Ly6Gþ cells than
negative tumors following identical therapy (Fig. 6B–D; statistically signiﬁcant differences are identiﬁed by asterisks).
Because Ly6Cþ and Ly6Gþ cells have been reported to
promote tumor blood vasculature (30), we determined the
effects of TLR4 and paclitaxel therapy on formation of blood
vessels. We found that BVD was signiﬁcantly increased by
2.5-fold (P < 0.001) in treated mice with 1806TLR4þ, but not
in other experimental groups (Fig. 6E and F). The role of

immature myeloid cells in chemotherapy-driven vascular formation was also supported by treatment with anti-CD11bþ
antibody, which signiﬁcantly reduced intratumoral densities of
both CD11bþ monocytes and blood vessels (Supplementary
Fig. S4). We next determined whether increased BVD corresponded to enhanced tumor cell invasion of these vessels.
Tumors were double-stained with w6/32 (anti-human HLA)
and MECA-32 (anti-mouse BV marker) antibodies followed
by quantifying the percent of tumor-invaded vessels of total
open-lumen MECA-32þ structures. Following nab-paclitaxel
treatment, TLR4-positive tumors displayed slightly higher

0.2% in TLR4-negative group); however, this difference was
not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 6G). This suggested that
although TLR4–paclitaxel-recruited Ly6Cþ and Ly6Gþ myeloid cells enhanced formation of new blood vessels they had no
effect on tumor invasion of these vessels.
Activation of the TLR4–paclitaxel axis creates de novo
intratumoral lymphatics and promotes their invasion
As increased metastasis could not be explained by
enhanced invasion of blood vessels, we hypothesized that

TLR4 and Paclitaxel Promote Metastasis

the prometastatic effect of the TLR4–paclitaxel axis might
be mediated through increased tumor cell access to lymphatics. To test this hypothesis, we restained tumors shown
in Fig. 6 for lymphatic-speciﬁc markers. As previously
reported (31), native HCC1806 tumors lack intratumoral
lymphatics although they are rich in peritumoral Lyve-1þ
structures as shown in Fig. 7A. This pattern did not change
in the absence of TLR4 or omission of paclitaxel therapy. In
sharp contrast, all treated mice with 1806TLR4þ tumors
display extensive network of intratumoral lymphatics as
shown in the last panel of Fig. 7A. The mean LVD in this
group was 5.0  0.7 Lyve-1þ vessels/mm2, which was
approximately 25-fold higher than in any other group (Fig.
7D). These de novo created vessels, residing as deep as 792
mm from the tumor margin, displayed clear lymphatic
phenotype as shown by mutually exclusive staining pattern
with a blood vascular-speciﬁc marker, MECA-32 (Fig. 7B),
and conﬁrmed by another lymphatic-speciﬁc marker, Prox1
(Fig. 7C). Importantly, the new intratumoral lymphatics
were highly permissive for tumor cell invasion as demonstrated by the drastically increased fraction of occluded
Lyve-1þ vessels that increased from zero in TLR4-negative
tumors to 42% in TLR4-positive tumors treated by nabpaclitaxel (Fig. 7D). In comparison, only 8% of lymphatic
vessels were invaded in 1806TLR4þ tumors without treatment. Noteworthy that albeit TLR4-negative tumors were
surrounded by Lyve-1þ peritumoral vessels (Fig. 7A), most of
them showed no signs of invasion (Fig. 7F). In sharp contrast, the majority of both peritumoral and intratumoral
Lyve-1þ vessels in TLR4-positive tumors after chemotherapy
were invaded by malignant cells (Fig. 7G). These ﬁndings
demonstrate a paramount role of tumor-expressed TLR4 in
paclitaxel chemotherapy-driven lymphatic metastasis.

Emerging evidence derived from recent clinical and experimental studies highlights the dark side of chemotherapy,
namely, its alarming association with metastatic relapse after
treatment. In particular, clinical studies showed a link between
the widely used drug paclitaxel and substantial increase in
lymphatic metastasis (32), tumor recruitment of prometastatic myeloid cells (32), circulating inﬂammatory cytokines
(33), intratumoral COX-2 (34), and resistance to cytotoxic
therapy (35). Paclitaxel was also shown to signiﬁcantly promote metastasis in a transgenic breast cancer model MMTVPyMT (32), orthotopic human breast (26), and ovarian (36)
xenografts as well as syngeneic models of melanoma and colon
cancer (6). Mechanistically, the prometastatic effects of paclitaxel can be attributed to its ability to induce NF-kB–dependent inﬂammatory, angiogenic, and prosurvival factors that
either directly enhance tumor aggressiveness (37) or mobilize
bone marrow myeloid cells that promote tumor spread via
paracrine loops (32). We recently proposed that prometastatic
effects of paclitaxel are mediated by tumor-expressed TLR4
(8). Macrophage-expressed TLR4 is a naturally designed pathway that propagates inﬂammatory local and systemic circuits
that expand pools of myeloid progenitors and recruits them to

www.aacrjournals.org

sites of inﬂammation to repair injured vasculature. We previously showed that TLR4-positive tumors vigorously react to
paclitaxel therapy by upregulating inﬂammatory mediators
that create a favorable environment for expansion of primary
tumors (8). Here, we used mouse and human breast cancer
models with differential expression of TLR4 to analyze its
role in promoting vasculature that subsequently increases
locoregional and distant metastasis following the paclitaxel
therapy.
This analysis showed that both TLR4 and paclitaxel play
paramount roles in determining the magnitude of metastatic
spread. Even in the absence of treatment, TLR4 expression in
tumor cells caused multifold increases in both inﬂammatory
cytokines and metastasis compared with tumors lacking this
receptor (Figs. 1 and 2). This drug-independent activation
of TLR4 might be mediated by endogenous ligands overexpressed in breast cancer such as hyaluronan (38) and S100A8/
A9 (39). We also observed TLR4-independent effects of paclitaxel, which was evident by moderately enhanced inﬂammation and metastasis in tumor models lacking this receptor
(Fig. 2). This effect might be mediated by TLR2 receptor (40)
or by sensory receptors such as RAGE (25) and TREM-1 (41), all
of which are known to be activated by the products of dead
cells generated by chemotherapy. This scenario may explain
prometastatic effects of chemotherapeutics other than paclitaxel, including cyclophosphamide (42), gemcitabine (43),
and cisplatin (6, 43). However, combination of paclitaxel and
TLR4-positive tumors signiﬁcantly increased the magnitude
of the effect, resulting in a 500% increase in incidence of
lymph node and pulmonary metastasis and up to 245-fold
elevated nodal burden (Supplementary Table S2). This was
concomitant with an approximately 300-fold increase in intratumoral inﬂammatory mediators (Fig. 2D), implicating the
inﬂammatory consequence of the activated paclitaxel–TLR4
pathway as the primary cause of increased metastasis.
Notably, paclitaxel-dependent activation of TLR4 increased
inﬂammation not only in the local tumor environment, but also
in the blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, and lungs
(Figs. 4 and 5). This observation is not surprising given the
natural function of macrophage-expressed TLR4 to systemically alert responsive organs for the presence of pathogens
urging them to generate hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors. Under normal circumstances, these progenitors are
recruited to the pathogen-invaded site to replenish the pool of
immune cells, clear debris, and restore tissue homeostasis,
including the repair of vasculature. Analogously, in mice with
TLR4-positive tumors, paclitaxel induced strong responses in
bone marrow and spleen, resulting in an approximately 20-fold
increase in CD11bþ/Ly6Cþ and CD11bþ/Ly6Gþ progenitors
that subsequently massively mobilized to tumors (Figs. 5
and 6). These ﬁndings are consistent with widely reported
paclitaxel-dependent (6, 32, 44) increases in bone marrow
produced progenitors along with the evidence for their prometastatic effects upon arrival to primary (32) and distant
tumor sites (44). However, this is the ﬁrst evidence that both
expansion of CD11bþ/Ly6Cþ/Ly6Gþcells at TLR4-responsive
organs and their recruitment to tumors is enhanced by taxane
therapy and correlate with tumor-expressed TLR4. This notion

TLR4 and Paclitaxel Promote Metastasis

cancer lines (45). Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that
prometastatic effects of the paclitaxel–TLR4 axis are mediated,
in part, by chemotherapy-induced factors in primary tumors
that are released to systemic blood circulation and promote
successful engraftment of malignant cells at secondary sites.
Paclitaxel therapy of TLR4-positive tumors creates
intratumoral lymphatic vessels and promotes their
invasion
One of the most remarkable and important ﬁndings in this
study is the discovery that paclitaxel therapy induced de novo
formation of intratumoral lymphatics in TLR4-positive (but
not negative) tumors (Fig. 7). It is currently believed that
peritumoral lymphatic vessels are mainly responsible for
malignant spread (31), because intratumoral lymphatics are
rare in most untreated tumors, including breast cancers, that
preferentially metastasize through these vessels (46). However,
tumors that do generate intratumoral lymphatics are much
more efﬁcient in reaching lymph nodes (47), resulting in a
signiﬁcantly higher risk for relapse and poorer prognosis (48).
We show here that although blood and lymphatic vessels are
both signiﬁcantly increased in TLR4-positive tumors following
chemotherapy, only the latter were invaded by tumor cells (Fig.
7). This suggests that the primary mechanism by which the
paclitaxel–TLR4 axis promotes breast cancer metastasis is
through creation of penetration-permissive intratumoral
channels that exponentially increase the number of malignant
cells transported to the local nodes. This new mechanism in
tumor biology might mirror a previously established ability of
the LPS-activated TLR4 pathway to promote lymphangiogenesis mediated by bone marrow-derived macrophages recruited
to the inﬂamed site (49). Analogously, the paclitaxel–TLR4
pathway may induce intratumoral lymphangiogenesis mediated by CD11bþ myeloid progenitors mobilized to the tumor
site (Fig. 6). Thus, this discovery not only provides a likely
explanation for paclitaxel-mediated metastasis, but also suggests a novel way to study the formation of tumor lymphatics

by comparing parallel steps of this monocyte-driven process
induced by both chronic inﬂammation and cancer (50).
In summary, we show here that paclitaxel chemotherapy
substantially increases the magnitude of lymphatic and distant
metastasis through activation of the TLR4 pathway in tumor
cells, which strongly elevates inﬂammation in the tumor
environment, regional nodes, and distant organs thus favoring
malignant outgrowth. The prometastatic phenotype is locally
driven by de novo formation of intratumoral lymphatics and
ampliﬁed systemically by expansion of myeloid provascular
progenitors and their recruitment to both primary and distant
sites. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that blocking paclitaxel-induced inﬂammation in patients with TLR4-positive
cancers may signiﬁcantly improve therapeutic outcome.
