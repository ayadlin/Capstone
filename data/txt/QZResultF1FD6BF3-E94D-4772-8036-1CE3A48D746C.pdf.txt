BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML), imatinib resistance is
of increasing importance. Imatinib dose escalation was the main treatment option before dasatinib, which
has 325-fold more potent inhibition than imatinib against unmutated Bcr-Abl in vitro. Data with a minimum
of 2 years of follow-up were available for the current study of dasatinib and high-dose imatinib in CP-CML
resistant to imatinib at daily doses from 400 mg to 600 mg. METHODS: A phase 2, open-label study was
initiated of 150 patients with imatinib-resistant CP-CML who were randomized (2:1) to receive either dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (n ¼ 101) or high-dose imatinib 800 mg (400 mg twice daily; n ¼ 49). RESULTS: At a
minimum follow-up of 2 years, dasatinib demonstrated higher rates of complete hematologic response
(93% vs 82%; P ¼ .034), major cytogenetic response (MCyR) (53% vs 33%; P ¼ .017), and complete cytogenetic response (44% vs 18%; P ¼ .0025). At 18 months, the MCyR was maintained in 90% of patients on the
dasatinib arm and in 74% of patients on the high-dose imatinib arm. Major molecular response rates also
were more frequent with dasatinib than with high-dose imatinib (29% vs 12%; P ¼ .028). The estimated

KEY WORDS: dasatinib, drug resistance, imatinib, chronic myeloid leukemia.

The development of targeted therapies to treat chronicphase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) resulted in a
positive shift in outcomes in patients with this disease.
The first Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) available
as treatment for CP-CML was imatinib (Gleevec; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), which became a first-line therapy.1-4 Despite the favorable results obtained with
imatinib,5 resistance occurred in a subset of patients with
CP-CML.3,5-8 This led to the development of recommendations defining response milestones.1,2 In the International Randomized Interferon Versus STI571 or IRIS
study, lack of complete cytogenetic response [CCyR]
could be identified in approximately 25% of imatinibtreated patients within 18 months after therapy initiation.3 Currently, the achievement of a CCyR by 18
months after starting imatinib therapy1,2 is considered a
minimally acceptable response.
Previous treatment options for imatinib-resistant
patients were limited and primarily included imatinib
dose escalation up to 800 mg daily.2 Data from small series demonstrated responses in a subset of imatinib-resistant patients after imatinib dose escalation.7,9-12 Dasatinib
(Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) was the
first TKI approved to treat patients with imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant CP-CML. Later, nilotinib
(Tasigna; Novartis) also became available. In vitro studies
demonstrated that dasatinib was 325-fold more potent
than imatinib at inhibiting unmutated BCR-ABL.13 The
potency of dasatinib, coupled with its activity against
imatinib-resistant mutations in vitro,14 provided a compelling preclinical rationale for its investigation in patients
with imatinib resistance. Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies have
demonstrated the effectiveness of dasatinib in CP-CML
after imatinib resistance or intolerance,15-19 with durable
responses after 2 years of follow-up.20
In the current study, we evaluated dasatinib and
high-dose imatinib in patients with CP-CML and
resistance to imatinib at doses from 400 mg to 600 mg

daily. Data with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up are
presented here.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study methods and eligibility criteria have been
reported previously17 and are described briefly below.
This multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 2 study
(START-R) evaluated patients who had CP-CML with
imatinib resistance at standard doses of 400 mg to 600
mg daily. Criteria for CP-CML diagnosis were defined
previously.17,19 Primary imatinib resistance was defined
as no complete hematologic response (CHR) after 3
months, no cytogenetic response after 6 months, no
major cytogenetic response (MCyR) (>35% Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells) after 12 months, or a
continuously increasing white blood cell (WBC) count
on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 2 weeks apart from
nadir to a WBC count 20,000/mm3 or an absolute
increase in the WBC count >50,000/mm3 above the
lowest value. Acquired imatinib resistance was defined
as disease recurrence after a previous hematologic
response or MCyR. Imatinib resistance could occur
only while the patient was receiving at least 400 mg to
600 mg daily of imatinib.
Eligible patients were aged 18 years and dasatinibnaive. Patients with imatinib intolerance or who
previously received imatinib >600 mg daily were
ineligible. In addition, patients previously identified
(screening was not required) with one of the following
BCR-ABL mutations, which are known to confer a high
degree of imatinib resistance in vitro, were excluded:
L248V, G250E, Q252H/R, Y253H/F, E255K/V,
T315I/D, F317L, and H396P/R.
All patients provided written informed consent, and
the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by each center’s
Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee. The study
4137

Original Article

was registered as a National Clinical Trial (NCT)
(NCT00103844) (available at: www.clinicaltrials.gov).
Patients were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive either oral dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (140 mg daily) or
oral high-dose imatinib 800 mg (400 mg twice daily).
Randomization was stratified by study site and cytogenetic response on imatinib (any response vs no cytogenetic
response). Dasatinib could be dose escalated to 90 mg
twice daily for disease progression or no MCyR at 12
weeks. Dose reductions of dasatinib to 50 mg or 40 mg
twice daily were permitted for toxicity. No imatinib dose
escalation beyond 800 mg daily was allowed, but imatinib
could be reduced to 600 mg daily for toxicity in patients
who had not been treated previously at this dose level.
Patients could cross over to the alternate treatment arm for
disease progression or intolerable toxicity17 according to
protocol guidelines. For the high-dose imatinib arm only,
patients also could cross over if they did not achieve an
MCyR or a 30% reduction in metaphases by 12 weeks.
Therapy continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, or discontinuation. Cytogenetic and hematologic evaluations were performed as
described previously.17 Quantitative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction analysis was performed every 4
weeks up to Week 12 and every 3 months thereafter.
The primary endpoint of the current study was the
estimated MCyR rate at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints
were the precrossover major molecular response (MMR)
rate; the MCyR and CHR rates at any time; the duration
of and time to MCyR and CHR; cytogenetic and hematologic responses after crossover; and safety. Before crossover to the alternate treatment arm for progression or
intolerable toxicity, the CCyR rate, the progression-free
survival (PFS) rate, the time to treatment failure, and
BCR-ABL mutations also were assessed. Additional analyses included cytogenetic response by prior imatinib dose
and prior cytogenetic response on imatinib and by primary or acquired imatinib resistance. The MMR was
defined as a BCR-ABL level 0.1% on the international
scale based on standard methodology.21,22 Disease progression was defined as progression to accelerated or blast
phase, loss of CHR or MCyR, or increasing WBC count
(doubling of the count from nadir to >20,000/mm3 or an
increase >50,000/mm3 on 2 occasions at least 2 weeks
apart). PFS was calculated as the time from randomization
until progression, treatment discontinuation because of
4138

progression before crossover, or death. The time to treatment failure was calculated as the time from randomization to progression (as described for PFS), the time off
study or crossed over, or death.
Analyses reported were based on data precrossover
unless otherwise specified. Adverse events (AEs) were
graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version
3.0).

Statistical Analysis
Sample size determination was based on the primary
endpoint. At least 100 dasatinib-treated patients were
estimated for a maximum 20% width of the 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and at least 50 imatinib-treated
patients were estimated for a maximum width of 29% for
the 95%CI.
In the initial study design, no formal statistical
comparison between treatment arms was planned. The
comparisons performed were unadjusted for multiplicity. Response rates were estimated with an exact
95%CI based on the Clopper and Pearson method.23
The Agresti and Min method24 was used to calculate
differences in response rates with corresponding
95%CIs, and for post-hoc response rate comparisons.
Kaplan-Meier curves with median and corresponding
Brookmeyer and Crowley 95%CIs25 were used to evaluate the duration of responses, time to treatment failure, and PFS. For PFS and time to treatment failure, a
2-sided post-hoc, unstratified log-rank test was used to
compare treatments. The time to response was summarized with Kaplan-Meier estimates.

RESULTS
Overall, 150 patients were enrolled and treated from
February 2005 to November 2005 (Fig. 1); follow-up to
November 2007 provided 2 years of study data. The
median follow-up was 26 months (range, 6.9-32.7
months). Most baseline characteristics were well balanced
between groups (Table 1), and the median time since
CML diagnosis was 59 months for all patients. An exception was a higher incidence of baseline BCR-ABL mutations in patients who were randomized to receive
dasatinib.

Dasatinib or High-Dose Imatinib in CML/Kantarjian et al

FIGURE 1. Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram is shown. Randomization was in a 2:1 ratio of dasatinib:imatinib. An asterisk indicates that patient death was within 30 days of dasatinib discontinuation; dagger, 2 patients who were
not listed had withdrawn from dasatinib therapy for intolerance (n ¼ 1) or for another reason (n ¼ 1) but were not yet receiving
high-dose imatinib; double dagger, 1 patient had developed disease progression and intolerance. MCyR indicates major cytogenetic response; Phþ, Philadelphia chromosome positive.

Response Rates
The CHR rate was higher with dasatinib (93%; 94 of 101
patients) than with high-dose imatinib (82%; 40 of 49
patients; P ¼ .034). At 24 months, a greater proportion of
patients receiving dasatinib (84%; 95% CI, 76%-93%)
than patients receiving high-dose imatinib (73%; 95%
CI, 49%-96%) were without loss of CHR. In patients
without a CHR at baseline, the CHR rate was 86% (43 of
50 patients) on dasatinib and 72% (16 of 22 patients) on
high-dose imatinib.
The MCyR rate was higher with dasatinib at 53%
(54 of 101 patients) than with high-dose imatinib at
33% (16 of 49 patients; P ¼ .017), and the CCyR rates
were 44% (44 of 101 patients) and 18% (9 of 49
patients) with dasatinib and high-dose imatinib, respectively (P ¼ .0025) (Table 2). Ninety percent (95% CI,
82%-98%) of patients receiving dasatinib and 74%
(95% CI, 49%-100%) of patients receiving high-dose
imatinib maintained their MCyR at 18 months (Fig.
2). For patients who achieved an MCyR, 45% (45 of
101 patients) and 18% (9 of 49 patients) of those
receiving dasatinib and high-dose imatinib, respectively,
Cancer

still were on study with an MCyR. Among the patients
who achieved MCyR, the reasons for discontinuing
dasatinib or high-dose imatinib included loss of MCyR
(5% and 6% of patients, respectively), intolerance (3%
and 4% of patients, respectively), or other reasons (1%
and 4%, of patients, respectively). In patients without a
baseline MCyR, the MCyR rate was 52% (49 of 95
patients) with dasatinib and 33% (16 of 49 patients)
with high-dose imatinib. The CCyR rate was 42% (41
of 97 patients) with dasatinib and 18% (9 of 49
patients) with high-dose imatinib among those who
were not in CCyR at baseline.
In patients who previously received imatinib at doses
of 400 or 600 mg daily, the MCyR rate was higher with
dasatinib than with high-dose imatinib both overall and
among those with and without a prior cytogenetic
response on imatinib (Table 2). Among patients with primary and acquired imatinib resistance, the MCyR and
CCyR rates were higher for dasatinib relative to high-dose
imatinib (Table 2).
The MMR rates were 29% (29 of 101 patients) with
dasatinib and 12% (6 of 49 patients) with high-dose

were grade 1/2 in both arms (Table 3). The more frequent
grade 3/4 nonhematologic events (2%) were fluid retention (including pleural effusion), dyspnea, infection,
fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and abdominal and musculoskeletal pain (Table 3). Five of the 25 instances of pleural
effusion reported with dasatinib were grade 3, and no
grade 4 events were reported. Occurrences of grade 3/4
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia were
more frequent with dasatinib (Table 3). There were 2
deaths reported on the dasatinib arm. One death occurred
within 30 days of the last dose and was caused by multiorgan failure, which was considered unrelated to dasatinib;
the other death occurred 44 days after study discontinuation because of progression to blast crisis.

Safety
The median treatment duration was longer for dasatinib
at 23 months (range, 0.16 months-29.4 months), whereas
high-dose imatinib was received for a median of 3 months
(range, 0.16 months-26.3 months). The median average
dose was 105 mg daily (range, 42-177 mg daily) for dasatinib and 796 mg daily (range, 358-800 mg daily) for
high-dose imatinib.
Treatment-related AEs were reported in 93% (94 of
101 patients; (grade 3/4, 61%; 62 of 101 patients) of
patients on the dasatinib arm and in 90% (44 of 49
patients; grade 3/4, 39%; 19 of 49 patients) of patients on

Dose Modifications and Discontinuations
Dose interruptions occurred in 86 patients (85%) and
dose reductions occurred in 71 patients (70%) in the dasatinib arm. Initial dose interruptions and reductions were
for hematologic toxicities in 62 patients (61%) and 47
patients (47%), respectively, and for nonhematologic toxicities in 18 patients (18%) and 14 patients (14%), respectively. On the high-dose imatinib arm, dose interruptions
were recorded for 17 patients (35%), and dose reductions
were recorded for 6 patients (12%). Initial high-dose
imatinib treatment interruptions and reductions were for

* Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
y Hematologic adverse events were reported based on laboratory values.

Discontinuations because of AEs occurred in 23
patients (23%) receiving dasatinib and in 10 patients
(20%) receiving high-dose imatinib. Patient discontinuations because of hematologic AEs occurred in 10% (10 of
101 patients) and 8% (4 of 49 patients) of patients receiving dasatinib and high-dose imatinib, respectively, and
nonhematologic AEs occurred in 13% (13 of 101
patients) and 12% (6 of 49 patients), respectively. Nonhematologic AEs that resulted in treatment discontinuation
included 5 grade 1/2 pleural effusions (5%, 5 of 101
patients) in the dasatinib arm and 1 grade 4 joint effusion
(2%, 1 of 49 patients) in the high-dose imatinib arm.
Postcrossover Safety
After crossover, the median treatment duration was 89
weeks (range, 3 weeks-113 weeks) on the dasatinib arm (n
¼ 39) and 28 weeks (range, 4-100 weeks) on the highdose imatinib arm (n ¼ 20). Before crossover in patients
who withdrew from initial treatment (Fig. 1), the median
4144

treatment duration had been 34 weeks (range, 1 weeks108 weeks) on dasatinib (n ¼ 22) and 13 weeks (range, 1
weeks-68 weeks) on high-dose imatinib (n ¼ 39).
After crossover, the treatment-related AE incidence
was 95% (37 of 39 patients) with dasatinib and 85% (17
of 20 patients) with high-dose imatinib; grade 3/4 AEs
occurred in 54% (21 of 39 patients) and 25% (5 of 20
patients), respectively. The most frequent treatmentrelated AEs were consistent with those reported before
crossover. Three deaths were reported on the dasatinib
arm, including 2 deaths that occurred within 30 days of
the last dose and were considered to be unrelated to dasatinib (1 patient had lung infection and sepsis and 1 patient
had acute heart failure) and 1 death caused by disease
progression.

DISCUSSION
The 2-year follow-up data for the current study demonstrate the durability of efficacy and provide mature safety

information. Consistent with the initial study report,17
dasatinib demonstrated higher MCyR, CCyR, and MMR
rates (53%, 44%, and 29%, respectively) relative to highdose imatinib (33%, 18%, and 12%, respectively). Efficacy results were achieved in pretreated patients who had
a median prestudy CML duration of 5 years who then
received dasatinib for an additional median 2 years. The
MCyR was durable for dasatinib, because 90% of dasatinib-treated patients maintained an MCyR at 18 months
compared with 74% of high-dose imatinib-treated
patients. The estimated PFS at 2 years was greater with
dasatinib (86%) relative to high-dose imatinib (65%),
and the estimated time to treatment failure was more prolonged with dasatinib. The time to treatment failure provided a composite endpoint of efficacy and safety and
produced results that were consistent with other study
endpoints. In addition, among patients who crossed over
to the other treatment arm, an MCyR occurred more
frequently with dasatinib (49%) than with high-dose imatinib (15%). The MCyR and CCyR rates in this study are
promising given the association between cytogenetic
response and survival and disease progression in patients
with CP-CML.5,26,27 Overall, dasatinib was found to
have durable response rates and prolonged PFS,
suggesting improved efficacy over high-dose imatinib in
this CP-CML population.
Because a previous response on lower doses of imatinib may suggest the presence of disease that is inherently
more sensitive to TKI therapy, the achievement of a
response in patients without a prior cytogenetic response
to imatinib may be expected to be difficult. In the current
study, however, patients who were receiving dasatinib
were able to achieve an MCyR regardless of their previous
imatinib dose (400 mg or 600 mg daily) and lack of a
prior cytogenetic response. Patients who were receiving
imatinib at doses 400 mg daily who did not achieve any
cytogenetic response appeared more likely to achieve an
MCyR with a change to dasatinib than with an imatinib
dose escalation to 800 mg daily.
The most common mechanisms for secondary or
acquired imatinib resistance are mutations in the
BCR-ABL kinase domain.6,13,28 Despite an imbalance of
BCR-ABL mutations at baseline, a higher CCyR rate was
reported with dasatinib than with high-dose imatinib
(43% vs 18%). These responses with dasatinib are
supported by in vitro data demonstrating that imatinibCancer

resistant cell lines, except for T315I, may have varying
levels of dasatinib sensitivity.13,14 It is noteworthy that the
dasatinib treatment arm had a higher proportion of protocol-specific mutations (18% vs 4%), which confer a high
degree of imatinib resistance in vitro.
The cytopenias and nonhematologic treatmentrelated AEs that were reported after 2 years of follow-up
generally were consistent with those in the earlier study
report.17 Interpretation of safety data and differences
between treatment arms may be limited, because the study
was predisposed to differences in treatment duration. The
median treatment duration of 23 months for dasatinib
and 3 months for high-dose imatinib allowed more
opportunity for dasatinib-treated patients to experience
an AE than imatinib-treated patients. In addition, the
eligibility requirement of adequate tolerability of 400 mg
to 600 mg daily of imatinib effectively preselected patients
with few AEs while receiving imatinib. It is interesting to
note that the safety results in this study apply to the dasatinib dosing regimen of 70 mg twice daily. A subsequent
large study demonstrated improved safety with a lower,
single daily dose.18
The results of this randomized study demonstrated
that the dasatinib dosing regimen of 70 mg twice daily
had improved response rates with prolonged PFS compared with high-dose imatinib. Dasatinib also demonstrated a positive effect regardless of the prior imatinib
dose received by patients. Particularly noteworthy is the
frequency of CCyR in dasatinib-treated patients in this
study. The achievement of CCyR has been associated
with a low risk of disease progression and improved survival in patients with CP-CML who are treated with imatinib.5,27 Thus, dasatinib rather than high-dose imatinib
should be considered the preferred treatment option for
patients with CP-CML who have experienced resistance
to imatinib doses of 400 mg to 600 mg.
The recommended dose of dasatinib recently was
modified to 100 mg once daily for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CP-CML based on
results of a phase 3, dose-optimization study with a
median treatment duration of 8 months in patients who
had CP-CML with resistance, suboptimal response, or
intolerance to imatinib.18 Study results demonstrated
similar efficacy between doses of 100 mg once daily and
70 mg twice daily, with a lower incidence of cytopenia
and a significantly lower incidence of grade 3/4

thrombocytopenia (P ¼ .004) and any grade of pleural
effusion (P ¼ .024) noted for the dosing regimen of 100
mg once daily.18 Overall, dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg
once daily demonstrated a more favorable risk-benefit
ratio than dasatinib at a dose of 70 mg twice daily. In that
study and in the current report, the average median dasatinib dose administered to patients who intended to take 70
mg twice daily was approximately 100 mg daily. The
equivalent efficacy and improved tolerability of dasatinib
at a dose of 100 mg once daily relative to 70 mg twice
daily further support dasatinib as a favorable therapeutic
option in patients who have CP-CML with resistance to
imatinib doses of 400 mg to 600 mg.
