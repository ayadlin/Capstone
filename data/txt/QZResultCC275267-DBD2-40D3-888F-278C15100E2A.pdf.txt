BACKGROUND. The use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the treatment
of men with prostate cancer has risen sharply. Although cardiovascular disease is
the most common reason for death among men with prostate cancer who do not
die of the disease itself, data regarding the effect of ADT on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in men with prostate cancer are limited. In the current
study, the authors attempted to measure the risk for subsequent cardiovascular
morbidity in men with prostate cancer who received ADT.

METHODS. A cohort of newly diagnosed men in a population-based registry who
were diagnosed between 1992 and 1996 were identified retrospectively. A total of

RESULTS. Newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients who received ADT for at least
1 year were found to have a 20% higher risk of serious cardiovascular morbidity
compared with similar men who did not receive ADT. Subjects began incurring
this higher risk within 12 months of treatment. However, Hispanic men were
found to have a lowered risk for cardiovascular morbidity.

T

he use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the treatment
of men with prostate cancer has risen sharply in the last decade,
partially based on evidence supporting specific indications for its
use in men with high-risk features who are undergoing radiotherapy.
This dramatic rise in the use of ADT in men with prostate cancer is
documented in data reported by Cooperberg et al. from a national
prostate cancer registry.1 In that cohort, the proportion of prostate
cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy who also
received ADT rose from 10% in 1989 to 75% in 2001. During the
same period, the proportion of men receiving ADT in conjunction
with brachytherapy rose from 7% to 25%. In 2001, 8% of men
undergoing radical prostatectomy received ADT, although evidence
does not support its use in that context. Although not curative, ADT

was the primary treatment strategy in nearly half of
the men diagnosed with high-risk localized disease
in 2001.1 ADT is the mainstay of therapy for men
with metastatic prostate cancer. As survival has
improved for these men,2 the skeletal effects of lifelong hormonal deprivation have been widely recognized.3,4 Although data suggest that cardiovascular
disease is the most common reason for death among
men with prostate cancer who do not die of the disease itself,5 the effect of ADT on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in men with prostate cancer
remains poorly described.
Although male sex is a risk factor for coronary
artery disease, evidence is accumulating that testosterone may actually have a cardioprotective influence
in men with prostate cancer (and in men in general).
Studies of men undergoing ADT have documented
an increase in adiposity; 1 study demonstrated an
increase in body fat of 9.4% after 1 year of ADT.6
Androgen deprivation has also been associated with
significant increases in total serum cholesterol and
triglyceride levels in men with prostate cancer.7 Obesity and hyperlipidemia are risk factors for coronary
artery disease.8 Accordingly, these effects of medically induced hypogonadism could provide a mechanism by which ADT would increase the risk for
cardiac morbidity and mortality.
Given the increasing use of ADT in men with
prostate cancer, we sought to measure the risk of
subsequent cardiac morbidity in this group of men.
We hypothesized that a direct correlation exists
between ADT use and cardiovascular morbidity. To
investigate this hypothesis, we examined cardiovascular outcomes in men receiving ADT for prostate
cancer who were registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database linkage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
We identified subjects with newly diagnosed prostate
cancer using a linked database combining the SEER
national cancer registry and Medicare claims for
1992 through 2000.9 The SEER registry identifies
patients at the time of a new prostate cancer diagnosis; data currently available are from 11 urban and
rural regions representative of the general U.S. population. The SEER registry includes the metropolitan
areas of Atlanta, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco/
Oakland, San Jose/Monterey, and Seattle/Puget
Sound, and the states of Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa,
New Mexico, and Utah.

Medicare claims data analyzed included the
Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR)
file, Outpatient file, and the National Claims History
(NCH) records. The MEDPAR file includes all Medicare Part A short-stay and long-stay claims with
International Classification of Diseases (9th revision
[ICD-9]) diagnosis and procedure codes for each
admission. The NCH records detail physician and
provider claims with Current Procedural Terminology
coding system (4th edition [CPT-4]) codes and corresponding ICD-9 codes. Linkage of the SEER registry
with Medicare data allows the integration of detailed
cancer information, such as stage and grade, with
claims information pertaining to procedural codes,
comorbidities, and dates of treatment.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Study subjects were identified on the basis of primary malignancy codes indicating prostate cancer in
the SEER dataset with a diagnosis made between
1992 and 1996 (to allow for adequate follow-up).
Subjects must have survived at least 12 months after
the initial diagnosis. Patients with all stages of disease at the time of diagnosis were eligible for study
inclusion except for those with in situ carcinoma.
Subjects were excluded if they were members of
health maintenance organizations or if they did not
have part A and part B coverage for 12 months
before and after diagnosis, due to concerns regarding
incomplete claims data. Subjects diagnosed at autopsy were excluded. Subjects were excluded if they
underwent bilateral orchiectomy at any time as evidenced by CPT-4 or ICD-9 procedure codes. Subjects
were excluded if they had a cardiovascular event
within 12 months of diagnosis because these events
may have represented manifestation of pre-existing
cardiac disease unrelated to ADT. The duration of
ADT use was calculated in terms of 1-month equivalent doses using fields found in NCH files (carrier/
miles/time/units/service count) or Outpatient files
(revenue center unit count).
Cohort Definition
The cohort of subjects receiving ADT was created by
identifying subjects with a first hormonal treatment
(defined by Medicare claim codes [all coding algorithms are available from the authors by request])
between 3 months prior to diagnosis and 6 months
after diagnosis. The control cohort was comprised of
men with prostate cancer who at no time received
ADT. Both groups were followed for 5 years after diagnosis. The main outcome of interest was cardiac
morbidity, as defined using the ICD-9 codes.

ADT and Cardiovascular Morbidity/Saigal et al.

Demographic data abstracted included age, sex,
race/ethnicity, and marital status. We consolidated
race/ethnicity into 4 categories: white, African American, Hispanic, and other. Information regarding individual subject socioeconomic variables is not
available through the linked SEER-Medicare files;
therefore, values were ascribed to individuals based
on ZIP code data from the U.S. Census Bureau. We
present annual income as the median income in a
subject’s ZIP code of residence. Education level is
presented as the percentage of residents in a subject’s ZIP code with a college-level education.

Calculation of the Comorbidity Index
Patient comorbidity was assessed using the Charlson
index, in which a higher score indicates greater
comorbidity, abstracted from Medicare claims
according to established techniques.10 The Charlson
score was calculated using both physician and hospital claims containing ICD-9 codes indicating a
comorbidity of interest. Claims were examined in the
year preceding the prostate cancer diagnosis, excluding claims occurring within the same month of diagnosis. We excluded claims for solid tumors,
leukemia, and lymphoma because we were measuring comorbidity in a cancer population, as suggested by others.10 ICD-9 diagnosis codes that only
appeared once on a physician claim were excluded,
as were claims with a specific ICD-9 diagnosis code
that only appeared during a 30-day window. In addition, we ascertained the prevalence of hypertension
(not included in the Charlson index) as defined by
ICD-9 codes 401-5 and 437.2.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics are presented for demographic
and clinical data. We compared these data among
subjects stratified by receipt of ADT using chi-square
analysis. To determine the independent association
of subject demographic and clinical variables (such
as receipt or duration of ADT) with cardiovascular
morbidity, we ran a multivariate logistic regression.
We incorporated variables thought to influence cardiovascular morbidity, including demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables. To ensure that the
model adequately fit the data, we also explored possible interaction terms. The interaction between
black race and the location of Detroit was persistently found to be significant and was retained in the
model. We also created a version of this model that
examined the impact of the duration of ADT on subsequent cardiovascular risk. ADT duration was
defined as either 12 months or >12 months. Onemonth equivalent doses were totaled up to the time

1495

of first cardiovascular event or death. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS software (version
9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
We identified 22,816 subjects who were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1992 and 1996
who did not experience a cardiovascular event during
the first 12 months after diagnosis. Of these, 4810
subjects (21%) received ADT, with the control cohort
comprised of the remaining 18,006 men. Table 1 presents demographic characteristics of the 2 cohorts.
Subjects who began ADT at the time of diagnosis
were older, less likely to be white, and more likely to
be of ‘‘other’’ race than subjects in whom ADT was
not initiated at the time of diagnosis (P < .0001).
Subjects who began ADT were more likely to have
metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis (P < .001).
The 2 groups did not differ significantly with regard
to measures of educational and economic status,
with the exception that subjects receiving ADT
tended to live in ZIP codes with higher median
incomes (P < .0001) (Table 2). Subjects who began
ADT at the time of diagnosis were more likely to be
diagnosed after 1994. Approximately 22% of patients
undergoing external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy received ADT compared with 12% of patients
undergoing radical prostatectomy.
On univariate analysis, those patients receiving
ADT were more likely to have had a cardiovascular
event in the 12 months preceding the diagnosis (19%
vs 15%; P < .001). They were also significantly more
likely to have a cardiovascular event 12 to 60 months
after diagnosis (24% vs 18%; P < .001). The prevalence of 2 cardiac risk factors, hypertension and diabetes, was found to be higher in the ADT group than
in men not receiving ADT (20% vs 17% for hypertension [P < .001] and 7% vs 5% for diabetes [P < .002]).
The mean time on ADT represented as 1-month
equivalent doses was 21 months. The mean time on
ADT represented as the date from the first claim for
ADT to the date of the last claim for ADT was 36
months.
Several clinical and demographic features were
found to be associated with cardiovascular morbidity
on multivariable analysis (Table 3). Subjects receiving
ADT had 1.2 times the risk of cardiovascular morbidity as those not receiving such therapy, after controlling for age, stage, grade, race, comorbidity score,
history of pretreatment cardiac disease, treatment
type, measures of socioeconomic status, and registry
location. A Kaplan-Meier analysis (Fig. 1) demonstrated a sustained difference in cardiovascular

pared with those in Utah. Subjects treated with external beam radiotherapy were found to have a higher
risk of cardiovascular morbidity compared with those
who received no treatment, whereas those treated
with radical prostatectomy had a lower risk. This
effect persisted after adding interaction terms
between the receipt of radiotherapy and ADT, and
pretreatment cardiac disease and radiotherapy (data
not shown). Subjects with preexisting cardiac disease
(prior to the diagnosis of prostate cancer) had more
than twice the risk of cardiovascular morbidity as
those who did not have preexisting cardiac disease.
Subjects with a Charlson comorbidity index score >0
had 1.6 times the cardiovascular morbidity risk of
those with a score of 0. Because subjects undergoing
radiotherapy may have had more comorbidities than
those undergoing radical prostatectomy, and patients
undergoing radical prostatectomy were less likely to
receive ADT, the model was run excluding subjects
undergoing radical prostatectomy. No significant
changes were found (data not shown).
The risk of cardiovascular morbidity was found
to be associated with the duration of ADT; those
receiving treatment for a total of 12 months had a
significantly higher risk than those who received
ADT for >12 months (hazards ratio of 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.46).

received ADT had a 20% higher risk of serious cardiovascular morbidity than similar men who did not
receive ADT. These data may temper physician enthusiasm for ADT in situations in which the clinical
benefit has not been established, such as primary
treatment for men with localized prostate cancer.
Given the contribution of cardiovascular disease to
mortality in men with low-risk or intermediate-risk
disease, those patients who undergo adjuvant or
neoadjuvant ADT for even a short duration may
actually experience decreased overall survival as a
result of this intervention. For men being treated
with ADT for metastatic disease, physicians should

1497

focus on interventions that may mitigate cardiovascular risks. Counseling on the importance of a lowfat diet, the promotion of aerobic exercise, and medical therapy to improve lipid profiles may have special
benefits in these patients. Our finding that the risk of
cardiovascular morbidity was observed during the
first 12 months of treatment should encourage physicians to begin these counseling interventions at the
time of the initiation of therapy to achieve maximum
benefit. We found a nonsignificant risk for longer
durations of ADT, perhaps because subjects were at
higher risk from the time of the initiation of therapy.
As time progressed, fewer men were eligible to incur this outcome, limiting our power to detect a
difference.
Prior investigation of the correlation between
androgens and cardiovascular health support our
findings in men with prostate cancer. Studies of animal models of atherosclerosis have demonstrated
that after castration, aortic atherosclerosis was
increased, an effect inhibited by testosterone.11,12
One population-based study of 1032 men and
women in the Netherlands found that men within
the highest tertile for bioavailable testosterone had a
relative risk of 0.2 for severe atherosclerosis, compared with men within the lowest tertile.13 Several
cross-sectional observational studies in humans have
also noted lower testosterone levels in men with coronary artery disease compared with controls,
although other studies have found similar levels in
cases and controls.14 Interventional data from prospective randomized controlled trials have provided
evidence that testosterone supplementation may
function as a coronary vasodilator in men with coronary artery disease. Testosterone supplementation
has been found to reduce exercise-induced ischemia
(as measured by ST segment depression) during
treadmill testing.15,16 Although they did not report
data concerning variations in risk by ethnicity or
treatment type, data from the study by Keating
et al.17 support our findings regarding the overall risk
of cardiac disease in men with prostate cancer who
receive ADT. The Early Prostate Cancer trials examined the effect of the antiandrogen bicalutimide versus usual care on overall and progression-free
survival. These trials did not find an effect on overall
survival in men who were being treated with the
agent.18 However, a trend toward reduced survival
was noted in men with localized disease being
observed with watchful waiting who began therapy
with bicalutimide. The reason for this trend was not
clear. Although myocardial infarction rates were similar in both treatment arms in the overall sample,
congestive heart failure rates were found to be higher
in the bicalutamide group.

Several mechanisms may explain the increase in
risk for cardiovascular morbidity in men rendered
hypogonadal as a result of ADT. Aside from testosterone’s potential direct dilatory effects on vascular
walls,19 low serum testosterone has been associated
with several modifiable risk factors for cardiac disease. A meta-analysis of the effects of testosterone
supplementation in hypogonadal men documented a
significant decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, although it was also was found to be
associated with a decrease in serum high-density
lipoprotein.20 Obesity, particularly visceral obesity, is
a recognized risk factor for cardiac disease. Androgen
receptors present on visceral adipocytes may inhibit
triglyceride uptake and thus retard fat accumulation.
Higher serum testosterone levels are associated with
lower levels of visceral obesity,21 and replacement
therapy in hypogonadal men has clearly been shown
to reduce visceral obesity.22,23 Hypogonadism has
been associated with and found to predict hyperinsulinemia; cardiac risk may be elevated through this
link to diabetes.24,25 Lower serum testosterone has
been associated with a prothrombotic state, which
may predispose men to myocardial infarction.26
Pugh et al.27 reported additional evidence of a link
between testosterone and the coagulation cascade in
a case-control study of men experiencing myocardial
infarction. Serum free testosterone fell acutely after
myocardial infarction; lower baseline levels of testosterone were associated with increased complications
after myocardial infarction.27 A prothrombotic effect
was also associated with diethylstilbestrol (DES)
treatment (another hormonal therapy for advanced
prostate cancer) in the Veterans’ Administration Co-

operative Urologic Research trials,28 perhaps due to
an effect on the coagulation cascade.29
Hispanic men with prostate cancer in the current
study sample were found to have a lower risk for cardiovascular morbidity after controlling for various
risk factors, including receipt of ADT. Other research
has documented a ‘‘Hispanic paradox’’ of lowered
cardiovascular mortality despite an increase in cardiovascular risk factors.30–32 This may be due to
genetic factors or the ‘‘healthy immigrant’’ hypothesis, which holds that included in the Hispanic male
group are a selected subset of individuals healthy
enough to meet the challenges of immigration.
Lower socioeconomic status as measured in the current study did not predict an increased risk of cardiac morbidity, although lower socioeconomic status
has been established as a predictor of cardiac morbidity in many population-based studies.33,34 Our
measures may be too crude to capture this risk; we
are limited to using group variables (median ZIP
code values) to impute individual socioeconomic
status.
Our finding that radiotherapy was associated
with an increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular
morbidity, whereas radical prostatectomy was associated with a lower risk, is unexpected. We had no a
priori hypothesis regarding such risks and therefore
the finding should be viewed with caution. This finding persisted after adding interaction terms with
receipt of ADT and preexisting cardiac disease. However, it appears plausible that unmeasurable risk factors (eg, disease severity, smoking status, obesity) for
cardiac disease in the patients receiving radiotherapy
or those steered away from surgery may explain this
finding.
The use of ADT differed in our sample in ways
that are consistent with earlier findings. Men receiving ADT had higher-risk prostate cancer than men
not receiving ADT, and men undergoing radiotherapy
were more likely to receive ADT, a finding that is
consistent with data supporting its use in this setting.35 Differences in the use of ADT by registry location are difficult to explain. They may be related to
therapeutic uncertainty regarding the usefulness of
ADT in situations in which few data are available for
guidance, or they may reflect physician or patient
preferences.
The current study has limitations. We were
unable to control for the use of nonsteroidal antiandrogens as part of combined androgen blockade;
combined androgen blockade may be associated
with a higher risk of cardiac morbidity due to the
establishment of a more complete hypogonadal state.
We were unable to control for 2 cardiac risk factors,

ADT and Cardiovascular Morbidity/Saigal et al.

obesity and smoking status, which are not captured
in claims data. We were also unable to control for
diet, activity level, or the use of medications that
modify cardiac risk, such as statins. Because our
sample consisted of Medicare beneficiaries, all subjects had access to healthcare. This access may have
masked socioeconomic differences in cardiac risk
that otherwise would have been apparent. The current study is neither prospective nor randomized and
men selected for ADT may have been at higher risk
for cardiovascular morbidity. To address this potential limitation, we created a model that adjusted for
variables that appeared relevant to this bias, and created interaction terms when indicated. Further prospective study is needed to confirm these findings.
Finally, the study is limited by the fact that it
employed claims data. Claims data are designed for
administrative use, as opposed to clinical studies;
practice patterns that create incomplete or incorrect
coding may bias results in unpredictable ways.
In this population-based study of men with
newly diagnosed prostate cancer, the use of ADT was
found to increase the odds of subsequent cardiac
morbidity by 20%. Increased risk for cardiac morbidity was observed within the first 12 months of treatment. Hispanic men had a lower risk for cardiac
morbidity. These data have particular relevance to
decisions regarding the use of ADT in men with
prostate cancer in settings in which the benefit has
not been clearly established. For men with metastatic
disease, focused efforts to reduce cardiac risk factors
through diet, exercise, or lipid-lowering agents may
mitigate some of the risks of ADT.
