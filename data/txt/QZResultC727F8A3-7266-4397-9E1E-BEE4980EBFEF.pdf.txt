Abstract
Author Manuscript

How neoplastic cells respond to therapy is not solely dependent on the complexity of genomic
aberrations they harbor, but is also regulated by numerous dynamic properties of the tumor
microenvironment. Identifying and targeting critical pathways that improve therapeutic efficacy
by bolstering anti-tumor immune responses holds great potential for improving outcomes and
impacting long-term patient survival. Macrophages are key regulators of homeostatic tissue and
tumor microenvironments; thus therapeutics impacting macrophage presence and/or bioactivity
have shown promise in preclinical models, and are now being evaluated in the clinic. This review
discusses the molecular/cellular pathways thus far identified whereby macrophages mediate
therapeutic responses.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Macrophages are represented in all tissues by functionally and phenotypically distinct
resident populations that are critical for development and homeostasis (Wynn et al., 2013).
Under non-pathological conditions, most resident macrophage populations derive from
embryonic progenitors and are maintained through local proliferation (Epelman et al., 2014).
Exceptions to this include intestinal, dermal and alveolar macrophages at barrier sites (Bain
et al., 2014; McGovern et al., 2014; Perdiguero et al., 2014; Yona et al., 2013), and
macrophages in the adult heart that are replaced by circulating bone marrow-derived Ly6C+
inflammatory monocytes over a time scale of several weeks (Molawi et al., 2014). Under
pathological conditions, there is evidence for both local proliferation and recruitment, with

differences observed by tissue location and type of inflammatory insult (Epelman et al.,
2014).

Author Manuscript

Solid tumors appear to be unique; preclinical studies indicate absence of macrophage
proliferation and shorter half-lives as compared to resident macrophages in counterpart
homeostatic tissues, measurable in days to weeks (Movahedi et al., 2010; Strachan et al.,
2013). That said, proliferating CD68+ cells, also positive for proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) expression, have been observed in breast cancers where they are associated
with poor clinical outcome (Campbell et al., 2011). Whether macrophage life span in this
context is reflecting diminished tissue integrity, extent of damage/inflammation, or instead
represents an adaptive process engaged by tumors to support growth is unclear, but
production of the C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and/or colony stimulating factor-1
(CSF-1) are necessary to sustain their numbers (Noy and Pollard, 2014). With the critical
role for CCL2 and CSF-1 in recruiting macrophages to neoplastic tissue there is growing
interest in therapeutics targeting these ligands and/or their respective receptors in an effort to
ablate pro-tumorigenic properties of macrophages. This therapeutic approach has led to
improved outcomes in a range of pre-clinical models — particularly for agents targeting
CSF-1 or the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) — results of which have spurred several clinical
trials (Table 1).

Author Manuscript

As monotherapy, CSF-1R inhibition alone impedes growth of orthotopically implanted
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines (Mitchem et al., 2013), prevents
cervical carcinogenesis (Strachan et al., 2013), and induces regression of glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) (Pyonteck et al., 2013). In other tumor models, CSF-1R inhibition is
without consequence as monotherapy; however, synergism with other modalities, including
chemotherapy (DeNardo et al., 2011; Mitchem et al., 2013; Paulus et al., 2006; Ruffell et al.,
2014), radiation therapy (Shiao et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2013), angiogenic inhibitors
(Priceman et al., 2010), adoptive cell transfer (Mok et al., 2014), and immune checkpoint
blockade (Zhu et al., 2014) have been revealed. Together, these findings implicate
macrophages in regulating therapeutic responses, and indicate that durable responses may be
more likely by augmenting standard-of-care or emerging therapies with “macrophage
antagonists”. This review will focus on the mechanisms underpinning these observations,
and conclude with a discussion of targeting approaches that extend beyond inhibiting
macrophage recruitment.

Clinical Significance of Macrophages
Author Manuscript

For many solid tumor types, high densities of cells expressing macrophage-associated
markers have generally been found to associate with poor clinical outcome (Figure 1)
(Komohara et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012). There is conflicting data for lung, stomach,
prostate and bone, where both positive and negative outcome associations have been
reported (Zhang et al., 2012), possibly related to the type/stage of cancer evaluated, (e.g.,
Ewings sarcoma versus osteosarcoma) (Buddingh et al., 2011; Fujiwara et al., 2011), or to
the type of analysis performed (e.g. quantitation of stromal versus intratumoral
macrophages). Some discrepancy may also reflect use of different macrophage markers.
CD68, a glycoprotein predominantly resident in intracellular granules, represents a fairly

specific marker for murine macrophages, and in combination with F4/80, identifies a
majority of tumor-associated macrophages. In humans however, CD68 expression is
widespread, and includes granulocytes, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and
some lymphoid subsets (Gottfried et al., 2008; Hameed et al., 1994; Ruffell et al., 2012b);
use of CD68 for association studies in this context is thus of variable utility. A clear example
of this is non-small cell lung cancer, where detection of macrophage scavenger receptors
CD163 and CD204, but not CD68, yielded clear correlations with negative outcome (Chung
et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2012; Ohri et al., 2011; Quatromoni and Eruslanov, 2012).

Author Manuscript

In addition to potentially representing more selective macrophage biomarkers, both CD163
and CD204 are associated with activation of macrophages towards an alternative or tumorpromoting and immunosuppressive phenotype, and accordingly, significant correlations
between CD163/CD204 and negative outcomes have been reported across multiple tumor
types (Komohara et al., 2014). This correlation may indicate that macrophage polarization
can direct clinical outcome, also supported by the positive association between presence of
CD68+ cells and survival in colorectal adenocarcinoma (Roxburgh and McMillan, 2012).
Unlike most populations of tumor-associated macrophages that possess pro-tumor and
immunosuppressive properties (Biswas and Mantovani, 2010), macrophages in human
colorectal cancer have been found to be functionally (and phenotypically) anti-tumor (Edin
et al., 2012; Ong et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014). Together, these data collectively support
the tenet that repolarizing macrophages towards an anti-tumor phenotypic state, either by
impeding activities/signals that drive pro-tumor polarization, or delivering exogenous
signals that enhance anti-tumor polarization, could act as an alternative and perhaps more
efficacious approach to blocking macrophage recruitment, even though these activities and
responses are all dynamically regulated in vivo. Indeed, an agonist monoclonal antibody
against CD40, a co-stimulatory protein found on professional antigen-presenting cells, has
demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
(Beatty et al., 2011) and patients with PDAC (Beatty et al., 2013) when delivered in
combination with the chemotherapeutic gemcitabine, ostensibly via the anti-tumor activities
of macrophages and CD8+ T cells (Vonderheide et al., 2013). In addition to use of an antiCSF-1R depleting antibody in diffuse-type giant cell tumors (Ries et al., 2014), these are the
first clinical studies to demonstrate potential efficacy of macrophage-targeted agents.

Polarization and Macrophage Function

Author Manuscript

Macrophages produce an array of cytokines, chemokines, polypeptide growth factors,
hormones, matrix remodeling proteases and metabolites, many of which possess tumorpromoting activities (De Palma and Lewis, 2013; Noy and Pollard, 2014; Ruffell et al.,
2012a). A caveat to some of these reported activities is that many findings originate from
cell culture studies utilizing neoplastic myeloid cell lines or bone marrow-derived
macrophages, and thus cannot account for the complex milieu of polarization signals that
macrophages would be exposed to in vivo (Figure 2). This includes the aforementioned
CSF-1 and CCL2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) such as high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), extracellular ATP, and
degraded extracellular matrix components (Ruffell et al., 2012a; Zelenay and Reis e Sousa,
2013).

Stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α and -2α are also important in mediating
the pro-tumor properties of macrophages, as evidenced from the use of LysM-cre mice to
induce myeloid-specific loss of either factor (Doedens et al., 2010; Imtiyaz et al., 2010). As
might be expected, hypoxic conditions drive an angiogenic phenotype in macrophages, and
in vivo this occurs specifically in a subpopulation of macrophages found within hypoxic
regions of tumors that express low levels of major histocompatability complex (MHC) II
(Laoui et al., 2014; Movahedi et al., 2010). The recruitment of macrophages (presumably
MHCIILO) into hypoxic regions through Neuropilin-1 also supports an immunosuppressive
phenotype (Casazza et al., 2013) that is likely dependent upon HIF-1α (Doedens et al.,
2010). Surprisingly however, while hypoxia can induce HIF-1α-dependent expression of
arginase-1 in macrophages (Doedens et al., 2010), neither improving tumor oxygenation, nor
preventing macrophage recruitment into hypoxic areas alters arginase-1 expression (Casazza
et al., 2013; Laoui et al., 2014). This discrepancy might be explained by the recent finding
that lactic acid promotes arginase-1 expression by macrophages in a HIF-1α-dependent
manner (Colegio et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

Finally, the use of immune competent murine models has firmly established that
macrophage polarization and function within tumors is strongly influenced by lymphocytes
through the production of multiple factors including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-13,
interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and immunoglobulins (Andreu et al.,
2010; DeNardo et al., 2009; Gocheva et al., 2010; Guiducci et al., 2005; Kang et al., 2011).
These activities include mediating responses to therapy, as B cells coated in anti-CD20
antibody can suppress their phagocytic removal from circulation by Kupffer cells through
the secretion of IL-10 (Horikawa et al., 2011), while B cell production of immunoglobulins
(Affara et al., 2014) and CD4+ T cell expression of IL-4 (Shiao et al., 2015) suppress
responses to cytotoxic therapy by altering macrophage polarization. Even the efficacy of
CSF-1R inhibition depends upon altered macrophage polarization, rather than depletion, in
certain models (Pyonteck et al., 2013).

Macrophage Function and Therapeutic Resistance
Regulation of tumor cell survival pathways by macrophages

Author Manuscript

The general concept that neoplastic cell extrinsic factors mediate resistance to cytotoxic
therapy owes to three dimensional (3D) cell culture models evaluating microenvironmentalderived factors (Correia and Bissell, 2012), but in vivo studies have revealed that
macrophages also mediate chemotherapy resistance by providing survival factors and/or
activating anti-apoptotic programs in malignant cells. While macrophage-secreted soluble
factors have usually been implicated, it is also possible that extracellular matrix deposition
and/or remodeling, or direct cell-cell interactions are involved (Castells et al., 2012; Correia
and Bissell, 2012; Meads et al., 2009).
Using a CSF-1 neutralizing antibody in combination with chemotherapy, Paulus and
colleagues reported increased chemosensitivity of subcutaneous MCF-7 breast cancer
xenografts (Paulus et al., 2006). Co-culture studies utilizing mammary carcinoma cell lines
and bone marrow-derived macrophages revealed macrophage-mediated resistance to
paclitaxel, doxorubicin and etoposide (Shree et al., 2011), and to gemcitabine in murine

PDAC cells (Mitchem et al., 2013). At least with PDAC cells, this resistance is dependent
on activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), implicating
macrophage IL-6 or other macrophage-derived factors such as milk-fat globule-epidermal
growth factor-VIII, found to promote resistance to carboplatin in vivo and synergize with
IL-6 to enhance tumor cell growth (Jinushi et al., 2011). STAT3 activation promotes
neoplastic cell proliferation and survival, and multiple tumor cell lines exhibit IL-6 or
STAT3-dependent chemoresistance in vitro (Taniguchi and Karin, 2014; Yu et al., 2014).
Though autocrine production of IL-6 is common, tumor-associated macrophages produce
IL-6 in vivo (DeNardo et al., 2009; Movahedi et al., 2010; Song et al., 2009), with
expression induced in bone marrow-derived macrophages by co-culture with neoplastic cells
(Mitchem et al., 2013). However, as the only in vivo evidence of IL-6 being
chemoprotective derives from a murine lymphoma model where IL-6 is expressed by thymic
endothelial cells (Gilbert and Hemann, 2010), the source and relevance of IL-6 during
chemotherapy for solid tumors remains incompletely described.

Author Manuscript

Surprisingly, macrophage production of soluble chemoprotective factors is in part dependent
on cathepsin protease activity, specifically cathepsin B and S, where inhibition of cathepsin
activity in vivo enhances response of mammary carcinomas to paclitaxel (Shree et al.,
2011). A possible underlying mechanism may derive from cathepsin B-dependent activation
of inflammasomes in myeloid cells following treatment with gemcitabine or 5-FU, leading
to IL-1β release and enhancement of a TH17 immune response (Bruchard et al., 2013).
Tumor-associated macrophages isolated from ovarian cancer patients also direct IL-17
production in memory T cells through IL-1β and IL-23 production (Kryczek et al., 2009). As
IL-17 induces IL-6 expression in multiple cell types, including melanoma, mesenchymal,
endothelial, and immune cells (Wang et al., 2009), cathepsin B could therefore be linked
indirectly to STAT3 activation. However, IL-17 has also been found to direct anti-tumor
responses to subcutaneously implanted tumor cell lines following treatment with
anthracycline chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2011), and a role for IL-17 fails to explain
macrophage chemoprotection in the absence of T cells. A more direct pathway may be
through IL-1β-induced IL-6 expression that occurs in multiple cell types, including
monocytes and osteoblasts (Mori et al., 2011; Tosato and Jones, 1990).

Author Manuscript

Alternatively, as cathepsin B activity is important in trafficking of TNF-α-containing
vesicles to the surface of macrophages (Ha et al., 2008), TNF-α may be one of the critical
factors mediating chemoprotection, either directly through NF-κβ activation (Li and Sethi,
2010), or indirectly through induced IL-6 expression and subsequent STAT3 activation
(Mori et al., 2011). Macrophages can be a critical source of TNF-α in vivo, as it has recently
been demonstrated that macrophage-derived TNF-α imparts resistance to MAPK inhibitors
in melanoma through NF-κβ-dependent expression of microphthalmia transcription factor
(Smith et al., 2014). Further research is warranted to determine whether macrophages indeed
mediate resistance to cytotoxic therapies via these pathways, and to extend these finding to
other targeted therapeutics, as with the complexities of TNF-α and NF-κβ in cancer
development/growth, the efficacy of targeting these pathways may be context specific
(Balkwill, 2009).

Macrophages and tumor angiogenesis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Macrophages are well-described regulators of tumor angiogenesis, with supporting evidence
derived from both clinical and experimental studies (Murdoch et al., 2008; Ruffell et al.,
2012a), wherein much of their capability is associated with vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) signaling. This includes macrophage production of VEGF-A (Lin et al.,
2007; Stockmann et al., 2008), production of VEGF homologues such as placental growth
factor (Fischer et al., 2007; Rolny et al., 2011), enhancement of VEGF-A bioavailability
through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity (Bergers et al., 2000; Du et al., 2008;
Giraudo et al., 2004; Nakasone et al., 2012), and induction of VEGF-A production by
endothelial cells via WNT7B expression (Yeo et al., 2014). VEGF-A drives formation of
abnormal vasculature in tumors, consisting of excessive branching, dead-end vessels, and
vessel leakiness, that together impact tumor hemodynamics and drug delivery (Heldin et al.,
2004; Tredan et al., 2007). VEGF antagonists induce vascular normalization (Greenberg et
al., 2008; Jain, 2005), and several studies have reported increased uptake of
chemotherapeutics associated with this process, likely due to reduced vessel leakiness and
interstitial fluid pressure (Chauhan et al., 2012; Tong et al., 2004; Turley et al., 2012).
Although macrophages are not necessarily a dominant source of VEGF-A in all tumor
tissue, specific deletion of VEGF-A in macrophages via lysozyme M promoter-driven Cre
recombinase revealed their role in driving abnormal vascular phenotypes in tumors
(Stockmann et al., 2008). Importantly, similar to the use of VEGF antagonists, tumors in
these mice were more sensitive to chemotherapy; although unexpectedly, they also grew at a
faster rate due to improved tissue perfusion and reduced hypoxia in the absence of
therapeutic intervention (Stockmann et al., 2008).

While CSF-1 neutralization enhances response to chemotherapy in mammary carcinomas
(DeNardo et al., 2011), this is not due to increased delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, at
least for small molecules such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin (Ruffell et al., 2014). Why then
does macrophage depletion not phenocopy specific VEGF-A inhibition? One possible
explanation is that blockade of the CSF-1/CSF-1R pathway only partially depletes
macrophages in tumors, with macrophages surrounding vasculature remaining (DeNardo et
al., 2011; Pyonteck et al., 2012; Ruffell et al., 2014). This residual subset has not been
analyzed in detail, but at least a portion of the remaining cells are composed of Tie2+
macrophages (Mitchem et al., 2013) associated with vascular programming and important
mediators of tumor angiogenesis (De Palma et al., 2005; Mazzieri et al., 2011). Although
CSF-1 neutralization could functionally impair the angiogenic potential of Tie2+ monocytes
(Forget et al., 2014), neutralizing angiopoietin-2, the ligand for Tie2, inhibits growth of
mammary carcinomas (Mazzieri et al., 2011) – a phenotype not observed following
therapeutic inhibition of CSF-1 or CSF-1R – and exhibits efficacy in xenograft models when
used in combination with chemotherapy or VEGF antagonists (Brown et al., 2010).
Interfering with Tie2+ macrophage recruitment via CXCR4-blockade also enhances the
effects of the vascular-disrupting agent CA-4-P (Welford et al., 2011), and macrophage
depletion further suppresses tumor growth in the context of VEGF/VEGFR inhibition
(Priceman et al., 2010; Zeisberger et al., 2006). Although Tie2 is also expressed by
endothelial cells and pericytes (De Palma et al., 2005), and thus the results with
angiopoietin-2 neutralization cannot be entirely ascribed to the role of Tie2 expression by

macrophages in regulating vascular architecture (Mazzieri et al., 2011), it would be
interesting to evaluate combination angiopoietin-2 and CSF-1R-blockade for synergistic
efficacy.
Macrophages as mediators of immune suppression

Author Manuscript

In murine tumor models, macrophages contain immunosuppressive transcriptional profiles
(Biswas et al., 2006; Ojalvo et al., 2009), and accordingly, can directly suppress CD8+ T cell
proliferation in vitro (DeNardo et al., 2011; Doedens et al., 2010; Movahedi et al., 2010;
Ruffell et al., 2014). Based on macrophage expression of CD163, CD204, and CD206 in
human tumors, it is presumed that macrophages will exhibit similar profiles, although this
has yet to be evaluated in cells isolated directly from tumors. That said, CD14+ myeloid
cells from hepatocellular and ovarian carcinomas suppress autologous T cell proliferation
and IFN-γ expression in vitro, and nullify anti-tumor T cell activity during in vivo adoptive
transfer experiments (Kryczek et al., 2006; Kuang et al., 2009).

Author Manuscript

In mouse models, T cell suppression by immature myeloid cells is typically linked to
nutrient depletion via metabolism of L-arginine or production of free radicals (Gabrilovich
and Nagaraj, 2009). However, while hypoxia promotes macrophage suppressive activity via
expression of arginase-1 (Doedens et al., 2010), and thyioglycollate-induced peritoneal
macrophages suppress T cell proliferation through L-arginine depletion (Rodriguez et al.,
2003), inhibition of arginase activity does not blunt in vitro suppressive functions of tumor
macrophages (Movahedi et al., 2010). This seems to be the case even for MHCIILO
macrophages associated with hypoxic areas of tumors. To date, only inhibition of inducible
nitric oxide synthase (NOS) has been reported to reduce suppression by tumor macrophages
isolated from subcutaneously implanted lung carcinomas (Movahedi et al., 2010). Whether
macrophages directly suppress T cell activity in vivo remains compelling, albeit speculative,
but one role may simply be to overwhelm T cells with non-productive interactions (Broz et
al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

In humans, there is no evidence for a role of nutrient depletion in mediating immune
suppression by macrophages, since macrophages conditioned by ovarian carcinoma ascites
suppress T cell proliferation independent of arginase and NOS activity (Kryczek et al.,
2006). Instead, macrophages directly suppress T cell responses through programmed deathligand 1 (PD-L1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (Kuang et al., 2009) and B7-H4 in ovarian
carcinoma (Kryczek et al., 2006). This is perhaps fortuitous as immune checkpoint blockade
is therapeutically more attractive (Pardoll, 2012), with monoclonal antibodies against PD-1,
PD-L1, and PD-L2 all in clinical trials. Notably, response rates in the PD-1/PD-L1 trials
relate, at least partially, to PD-L1 expression in tumor stroma (Herbst et al., 2014; Tumeh et
al., 2014), consistent with a role for macrophages, and/or other stromal cells, in blocking
anti-tumor T cell responses. Could macrophage targeting enhance checkpoint blockade
therapy? At least one study to date has reported this using an orthotopic implant model of
PDAC, with CSF-1R inhibition providing additive efficacy to either PD-1 or cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) blockade in combination with gemcitabine (Zhu
et al., 2014). Importantly, CSF-1R inhibition also enhanced response to combined PD-1/
CTLA-4 blockade in the absence of chemotherapy (Zhu et al., 2014); thus, it would not be

surprising for CSF-1R antagonists to be combined with checkpoint blockade antibodies in
future clinical trials (NCT02323191).

Author Manuscript

Rather than directly suppressing anti-tumor T cell responses, macrophage may also regulate
the immune microenvironment, such that T cell responses are controlled indirectly through
an intermediate cell type, as was first suggested in human ovarian carcinoma with regulatory
T (TReg) cell recruitment via CCL22 (Curiel et al., 2004). In vitro, TReg cells induce IL-6
and IL-10 expression by macrophages, leading to autocrine upregulation of B7-H4 and a
suppressive phenotype (Kryczek et al., 2007; Kryczek et al., 2006). Macrophages are also a
key source of IL-10 in murine mammary carcinomas, but in this system, macrophages do
not express detectable levels of B7-H4 (Ruffell and Coussens; unpublished observations),
and IL-10 was not a significant mediator of macrophage polarization or suppressive function
(Ruffell et al., 2014). Instead, in mammary carcinomas exposed to paclitaxel, macrophage
IL-10 suppresses the capacity of dendritic cells to express IL-12, thereby blocking
productive cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses (Ruffell et al., 2014). Increased understanding
of interactions between macrophages and other immune cells in tumor microenvironments,
and deconstruction of the molecular pathways underlying these interactions, will
undoubtedly provide additional therapeutic targets to fine tune an immune response during
therapy.
Macrophages and metastasis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

From local invasion, intravasation into vessels, and extravasation at peripheral sites,
macrophages (or their monocyte precursors) have been implicated as regulators of all stages
of the metastatic process, often through positive feedback pathways involving CCL2 and/or
CSF-1 (Joyce and Pollard, 2009). Studies with human tissues have also demonstrated a
relationship between epithelial-mesenchymal transition and macrophage expression of
CCL18, for which there is no murine homolog (Meng et al., 2015; Su et al., 2014).
Preclinical mouse models of tumor development (mammary, pancreas, glioblastoma, etc)
wherein macrophages have either been depleted (albeit not completely) or reprogrammed,
exhibit diminished metastatic burden in end-stage mice (DeNardo et al., 2009; DeNardo et
al., 2011; Gocheva et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2001; Qian et al., 2009; Rolny et al., 2011; Shree
et al., 2011; Welm et al., 2007; Zabuawala et al., 2010). Mechanistically however, direct
evidence for a pro-metastatic role is largely derived from directed migration of neoplastic
cells in response to molecules secreted by macrophages (DeNardo et al., 2009; Mizutani et
al., 2009; Qian et al., 2009). The combined impact of these studies has been interpreted to
indicate that therapies targeting macrophage presence and/or polarization would ameliorate
metastasis in late-stage cancer patients. The fact that malignant cells likely already reside in
secondary metastatic niches long before clinical presentation of malignant primary disease
(Valastyan and Weinberg, 2011), mandates that this therapeutic approach be evaluated
carefully. A recent evaluation of preclinical mammary carcinoma metastasis models with
CCL2 neutralizing antibodies revealed enhanced metastatic burden; experimental
neutralization of CCL2, while limiting early metastatic processes, promoted metastasis
following cessation of therapy by enhancing recruitment of monocytes to micrometastatic
lesions (Bonapace et al., 2014). Therapies targeting the stromal compartment of primary
tumors may also prove ineffective at treating metastasis if the pathways regulating the

targeted process differ between the tissue of origin and the metastatic site. As a possible
example of this, IL-34 mediates development of Langerhans cells and microglia through
CSF-1R (Wang et al., 2012), whereas CSF-1R signaling is mediated in most tissues by
CSF-1 (Pollard, 2009). Development of macrophage-directed therapeutics aiming to
minimize or eradicate metastasis will therefore first require identification of pathways that
drive neoplastic cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune suppression in
ectopic sites. Some progress has been made in the lung, where both VEGF-A and
angiopoietin-2 appear important for angiogenesis in metastatic tumors derived from
mammary carcinomas (Bonapace et al., 2014; Mazzieri et al., 2011); however, as
mentioned, this may not be directly linked to macrophage function. Interestingly, CSF-1R
inhibition reverses the effects observed following cessation of CCL2 neutralization
(Bonapace et al., 2014), even though CSF-1R inhibition does not alter the number of
macrophages in lungs (Strachan et al., 2013). This could hint at a possible role for CSF-1R
signaling in mediating macrophage polarization in metastatic lungs, similar to the
observations in glioblastoma multiforme (Pyonteck et al., 2013). Nevertheless, it remains
uncertain whether macrophages are important in mediating therapeutic resistance at
metastatic sites, or even the degree to which they are involved in mediating metastatic
outgrowth. As the majority of patients succumb to metastatic disease, this is an urgent area
of research that has been largely unexplored, in part due to experimental obstacles and
maintaining mice with spontaneous tumors prone to metastasize where primary tumor
burden limits duration of study.

Macrophages as Therapeutic Targets

Author Manuscript

Based on compelling preclinical data from numerous laboratories indicating that
macrophage presence and/or activity are malleable in vivo (Figure 3), clinical studies are
now ongoing in several solid tumor types wherein macrophages are being targeted via
CSF-1R inhibitors or blocking monoclonal antibodies (Table 1). While a goal of these
clinical studies is to reduce the presence of tumor-associated macrophages, based on
preclinical and clinical studies, we anticipate that not all macrophages will be eradicated.
The hope is however, that those remaining will be reprogramed towards an anti-tumor
phenotypic state wherein they would support T cell responses, and together with cytotoxic
therapy, limit ongoing tumor growth. CSF-1R antagonists appear well tolerated as single
agents in both pre-clinical and clinical studies (Radi et al., 2011; Ries et al., 2014; Ruffell et
al., 2014), but with that significant macrophage depletion in the colon and liver is observed
in nonhuman primates, toxicity is a significant concern for combinatorial studies moving
forward. It should also be noted that while increased CSF-1 serum concentrations resulting
from the use of CSF-1R antagonists (Ries et al., 2014) provides an excellent biomarker to
evaluate on target efficacy, recent findings with CCL2 inhibition (Bonapace et al., 2014)
indicate that recurrence or exacerbation of disease is a possibility after therapy cessation.
These potential issues will need to be incorporated into the design of clinical studies for
appropriate drug combinations and patient monitoring.
Blocking macrophage recruitment into tumors (DeNardo et al., 2011; Shiao et al., 2015),
pro-tumor polarization (Affara et al., 2014; Pyonteck et al., 2013; Shiao et al., 2015) effector
function (Ruffell et al., 2014; Shree et al., 2011), or directly promoting macrophage

activation (Beatty et al., 2011), have all been used successfully in preclinical models to
enhance response to cytotoxic therapy. The question remains, which of these approaches
(Table 1) will be most efficacious when combined with cytotoxic, targeted, or immune
checkpoint blockade therapy. At least in a murine model of squamous cell carcinogenesis,
repolarizing macrophages was more effective than blocking recruitment, and in fact,
repolarized macrophages were necessary for recruitment of CD8+ T cells via CCR5 during
paclitaxel chemotherapy (Affara et al., 2014). For this reason, going forward it will be
critical to understand if depletion, or instead repolarization is the “best” therapeutic
approach to accompany combination therapy, for which tumor types, and at which stage of
tumor progression (primary or metastatic disease). Multiple agents targeting TH2 cytokines
and their receptors have gone beyond Phase II clinical trials with demonstrated efficacy in
autoimmune disorders and acceptable safety profiles (Beck et al., 2014; Corren et al., 2011;
Danese et al., 2015). Although none of these compounds have been re-directed towards
therapy in solid tumors, we have recently found that targeting this pathway (IL-4, IL-13,
IL-4Rα) improves response to cytotoxic therapy (Shiao et al., 2015).

One lesson learned from results comparing efficacy of immunotherapy in mice bearing
orthotopic versus subcutaneously implanted tumors is that the later exhibit enhanced
sensitivity (Devaud et al., 2014), indicating that context matters. In light of these findings,
and given the dearth of late-stage metastatic studies, it will be important to be mindful of the
fact that a one size-fits-all approach, while attractive, may not be realistic as we strive to
translate preclinical findings to the clinic. A major question to address from these preclinical
and clinical studies with either macrophage depletion or reprogramming approaches will be
to evaluate the durability of resultant anti-tumor immune responses formed against the
tumor. Along these lines, evaluating patients longitudinally for indicators of T cell function
could reveal an important diagnostic opportunity whereby monitoring circulating T cell
receptor diversity becomes a routine diagnostic strategy to indicate when addition of
combination therapy, e.g., immune checkpoint or anti-tumor vaccine, might be beneficial to
the patient.

Figure 3. Macrophage function in the tumor microenvironment

Author Manuscript

(a) Macrophage expression of IL-6 and TNF-α promotes survival signaling in neoplastic
cells and resistance to chemotherapy and targeted agents. Expression of survival factors is
dependent upon the protease activity of cathepsin B and/or S. (b) Neoplastic cell invasion of
ectopic tissue can be promoted through directed release of cytokines/chemokines such as
EGF and CCL18, or through protease-dependent ECM remodeling that may directly affect
neoplastic migration or increase chemoattractant bioavailability. EGF expression is driven
by signaling through the CSF-1R via neoplastic cell production of CSF-1, as well as T cellderived IL-4 (not shown). (c) Macrophages directly promote angiogenesis via production of
VEGFA and other angiogenic factors, and can enhance VEGFA expression by endothelial
cells through WNT7B. A subset of macrophages expressing the Tie2 receptor are recruited
to the vasculature by mural cell/pericyte expression of ANG2 and are important in
regulating vascular structure. (d) Direct suppression of a cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response
can occur via expression of B7 family ligands (PD-L1, B7-H4). Indirect suppression may
occur through release of IL-10 or recruitment of IL-10-expressing regulatory T cells (TReg)
via CCL22, whereby IL-10 suppresses the capacity of dendritic cells to produce IL-12 and
promote a TH1/CTL anti-tumor immune response.
