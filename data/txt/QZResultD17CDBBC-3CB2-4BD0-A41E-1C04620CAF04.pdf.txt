BACKGROUND: This prospective study describes the procedure-related anxiety, treatment-related anxiety, pain, and nausea experienced by children with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during the first year of treatment. METHODS: This study
was undertaken at 31 Children’s Oncology Group (COG) sites. Eligible children who were 2 to 9.99 years old were enrolled in a COG
trial for patients with newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL from 2005 to 2009. Parents completed a demographic survey at the baseline and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.0 Cancer Module (proxy version) and the General Functioning Scale of the Family
Assessment Device 1, 6, and 12 months after the diagnosis. The association between patient-related (age, sex, ethnicity, and treatment), parent-related (marital status and education), and family-related factors (functioning, income, and size) and symptom scores
was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean scores for procedure-related anxiety, treatment-related anxiety, and pain improved during the
first year of treatment (P < .0389). The mean nausea score was poorer 6 months after the diagnosis in comparison with the other
assessments (P 5 .0085). A younger age at diagnosis was associated with significantly worse procedure-related anxiety (P 5 .004).
An older age (P 5 .0002) and assignment to the intensified consolidation study arm (P 5 .02) were associated with significantly
worse nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL experienced decreasing treatment-related anxiety, procedure-related anxiety, and
pain during the first year of treatment. In comparison with scores at 1 and 12 months, nausea was worse 6 months after the diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION
The modern treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is extraordinarily successful with 5-year survival
rates of approximately 90%.1 Although the importance of lessening the symptom burden during therapy has long been
acknowledged, most existing research has focused on the assessment of late effects in long-term ALL survivors rather than
children receiving active treatment.2
Anxiety, pain, and nausea have been ranked among the most severe and bothersome treatment-related symptoms by
parents of children receiving cancer treatment.3 Procedure-related anxiety, treatment-related anxiety, pain, and nausea occur
as a direct and often immediate result of cancer treatment. These symptoms may be especially bothersome and burdensome
for children with ALL because the treatment is long and the patients are most often young. Anxiety stemming from anticipating treatments and procedures has been raised as a significant source of distress for children receiving cancer therapy by several investigators.3-5 Pain remains a common experience for children with cancer. For example, in a longitudinal assessment
of pain self-reported by 95 children with ALL aged 4 to 17 years, most reported pain at each of 7 interviews during the first
year of treatment.6 Information about the severity of nausea experienced by children receiving cancer treatment and the

Anxiety, Pain, and Nausea in ALL/Dupuis et al

extent to which it bothers them is very limited. However,
in the experience of adult cancer patients, nausea may be
more debilitating than vomiting.7,8
No longitudinal studies have explored procedurerelated anxiety, treatment-related anxiety, pain, and nausea over the course of treatment in children with ALL. It is
important to understand how these symptoms vary during
ALL treatment and to appreciate which factors may influence their severity so that appropriate and timely interventions can be offered.
This article is the third in a series that prospectively
describes the symptom burden and health-related quality
of life of children with standard-risk ALL enrolled in a
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) therapeutic clinical
trial9 during and shortly after treatment.10,11 The first article of the series describes psychological functioning in
these children during the first year of treatment.10 Anxiety
and depression were found to be problematic immediately
after diagnosis. Although anxiety symptoms lessened over
the first year of treatment, depression persisted. The second describes overall health-related quality of life during
and shortly after treatment in these children.11 Healthrelated quality of life impairment was observed at the end
of the first month of treatment, but there was improvement during and after treatment. A significant proportion
of children, however, experienced persistent physical and
social functioning impairment. In the current study, we
aimed to describe the burden of symptoms that are a
direct result of treatment during the first year of treatment: procedure-related anxiety, treatment-related anxiety, pain, and nausea. We also aimed to identify
potentially modifiable factors associated with these
symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Yale University human investigation committee and
the institutional review board of each participating site
approved this study. Informed consent and assent, when
appropriate, were obtained from all participants. Forms
were completed at 3 time points during the first year of
ALL treatment: approximately 1 month (day 1 of the consolidation phase), 6 months (day 1 of the maintenance
phase), and 12 months after the diagnosis (6 months after
the start of the maintenance phase).
Patients

This study was conducted at a subset of 31 of the 181
COG sites participating in the therapeutic protocol.
Participating sites were selected to participate in the ancillary study on the basis of interest, the availability of

resources needed to conduct the study, size (large and
small), university affiliation (academic and community
treatment centers), and location (urban and rural) to minimize potential center bias. Eligible patients were 2 to
9.99 years old, had a diagnosis of standard-risk–average
ALL,12 were enrolled in COG AALL033113 between
2005 and 2009, and had at least 1 parent with reading
comprehension of English or Spanish.
A treatment schema for AALL0331 is presented in
Figure 1. Induction therapy consisted of 4 weeks of therapy with dexamethasone, vincristine, pegaspargase, and
intrathecal methotrexate. Patients were then randomized
to 1 of 2 study arms: standard consolidation (4 weeks of
oral mercaptopurine, intravenous vincristine, and intrathecal methotrexate) or intensified consolidation (8 weeks
of intravenous cyclophosphamide, intravenous or subcutaneous cytarabine, oral mercaptopurine, intravenous vincristine, intramuscular pegaspargase, and intrathecal
methotrexate). Patients then entered the interim maintenance phase. From 2005 to 2008, patients were randomized to receive vincristine, intrathecal methotrexate, and
either oral methotrexate or escalating intravenous methotrexate. In 2008, the superiority of escalating intravenous
methotrexate was demonstrated,14 and all subsequent
patients received escalating intravenous methotrexate during interim maintenance. All patients then received 8
weeks of standard delayed intensification (dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, pegaspargase, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, intrathecal methotrexate, and
6-thioguanine) followed by maintenance (vincristine,
dexamethasone, oral methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine,
and intrathecal methotrexate).9 Girls and boys received
maintenance therapy for 2 and 3 years, respectively.
Parents of 194 eligible children were approached to
participate in this study, and 160 consented to participate.
The characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. The mean age of the children at diagnosis was 4.9 6
2.2 years; 52% were male. Most children were white
(68%), the parents of most children were married (70%),
and the majority of the mothers had attended a college or
university (63%). The mean family size was 4.6 (range, 210 members), and the annual household income was less
than $50,000 in more than half (56.7%) of the families.
Compared with parents who declined to participate in
this study, participants were more likely to be white and
non-Hispanic (P 5 .014) with an older child (4.9 vs 4.1
years; P 5 .03). No differences in other variables (school
age vs preschool age, sex, and treatment arm) were noted
between participants and nonparticipants.

Measures

At the first assessment (approximately 1 month after treatment initiation), the self-identified primary caregiver
1118

(the mother in 84% of instances) completed a self-report
demographic survey regarding ethnicity, the primary language spoken in the home, household income, marital status, maternal education, and family size. In addition, the
primary caregiver completed the General Functioning
Scale of the Family Assessment Device (FAD-GF).15 This
scale was administered to evaluate family functioning and
consists of 12 statements regarding coping strategies and
other family characteristics. Respondents are asked to
indicate the extent to which each statement describes their
family. For example, one statement is “making decisions
is a problem for our family.” Scores range from 1 to 4.
Depending on the domain, score thresholds for problematic functioning of 1.9 to 2.3 have acceptable sensitivity
(57%-83%), specificity (64%-79%), and diagnostic confidence (68%-89%).15 Higher scores reflect a higher
degree of problematic functioning, and the developers of
the FAD-GF have validated a cutoff score of more than 2
on the General Functioning scale to reflect unhealthy
family functioning.15
The primary caregiver then assessed his or her child’s
procedure-related anxiety, treatment anxiety, pain, and
nausea by completing the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 3.0 Cancer Module (proxy version). This
measure asks parents how problematic each of 8 items
(pain and hurt, nausea, procedural anxiety, treatment anxiety, worry, cognitive problems, perceived physical
appearance, and communication) has been over the last
month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from never to
almost always.16 The proxy-report Cancer Module has an
internal consistency reliability greater than 0.70, and for
the scales used in this study, reliability ranged from 0.85
to 0.93.16 Parents were given the instrument in their

and the FAD-GF again at the second and third assessment
time points (approximately 6 and 12 months after the
diagnosis).
Statistical Analysis

The primary outcomes were the PedsQL 3.0 Cancer
Module scores for pain, nausea, procedure-related anxiety, and treatment-related anxiety. Means and 95% confidence intervals of the scores at the 3 assessment periods
were described. The marginal time effect on each outcome
(and the difference in scores between time periods) was
assessed with a mixed model (longitudinal analysis of variance). To control the type I error rate, the step-down
method for multiple comparisons between time points for
each outcome was used to adjust for the pairwise comparisons in the mean scores of each outcome. Univariate linear
mixed model analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of patient-, parent-, and family-related factors and
each primary outcome, and we took into consideration
the correlated nature of the repeated measures at 3 time
points for each subject. The evaluated factors were as follows: patient’s age at diagnosis (dichotomized as preschool
age [2-4 years] vs school age [5-9 years]), sex, and ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, and other); protocol randomization; treatment site type (Community Clinical
Cancer

April 1, 2016

Oncology Program site vs other); respondent type
(mother vs other); FAD-GF score at the baseline; annual
family income; household size; primary language spoken
in the home (English vs other); highest level of maternal
education (college/university vs no college/university);
and marital status (married vs not married). Factors that
had a P value < .1 in the univariate analyses were included
in the multivariate longitudinal analysis. Differences
between patients who did and did not contribute a third
assessment were evaluated with the exact chi-square test
(categorical variables) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables). The significance level of .05 was considered
for all analyses; that is, a factor was considered to be associated with an outcome only when the corresponding
P values was <.05. All analyses were performed with SAS
statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary,
NC).
RESULTS
Patients

At the first assessment, 150 parents responded to the
procedure-related anxiety, pain, and nausea scales, and 149
provided responses to the treatment-related anxiety scale.
At the third assessment, 138 parents provided responses to
the treatment-related anxiety, pain, and nausea scales, and
137 responded to the procedure-related anxiety scale.
There were no statistically significant differences in either
patient characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, language, or
treatment arm) or characteristics of the family or parents
(family income, family size, maternal education, marital
status, or baseline FAD-GF score) between those children
whose parent did provide a response at the third assessment
and those children whose parents did not. However, children whose parents provided a third assessment had higher
mean pain (51.3 vs 39.2; P 5 .05) and nausea scores (83.4
vs 67.4; P 5 .001) on the first assessment than children
whose parents did not provide a third assessment. There
was no difference in treatment- or procedure-related anxiety scores observed between the groups.
Symptom Patterns Over Time

The mean scores for procedure-related anxiety, treatmentrelated anxiety, pain, and nausea are presented in Table 2
and Figure 2. The mean score of each outcome did not
differ according to the type of center (Community Clinical Oncology Program vs other) where patients received
treatment (P > .05) or according to the type of respondent (mother vs other; P > .05). However, the mean score
of each outcome was significantly different between each
of the 3 assessment periods (P < .0389).

pain scales (P < .0389) progressively improved over the
first year of treatment, and this indicated less anxiety and
pain with increased time on treatment (P < .007). In contrast, the mean nausea score approximately 6 months after
the diagnosis was significantly worse than the score 1

allocation (P 5 .01). None of the factors evaluated were
significantly associated with pain.
Procedure-related anxiety and nausea scores were
examined in a multivariate analysis (Table 4). In the
adjusted analysis, a younger age at diagnosis (P 5 .004)
was independently associated with significantly worse
procedure-related anxiety, but ethnicity, sex, and annual
family income did not retain significance. An older age at
diagnosis (P 5 .0002) and assignment to the intensified
consolidation study arm (P 5 .02) were associated with
significantly more nausea.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective, longitudinal study of children with
ALL enrolled in a large multi-institutional clinical trial,
we found that procedure-related anxiety, treatmentrelated anxiety, and pain improved over time. However,
nausea significantly worsened 6 months after the ALL diagnosis at the time when the intensive phases of chemotherapy were completed. We also found that patients
younger than 5 years were more likely to experience
procedure-related anxiety, whereas older children were
reported to experience more nausea. These findings highlight the need for targeted support for these age groups.
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to evaluate
procedure-related anxiety, treatment-related anxiety,
pain, and nausea longitudinally in a large cohort of children with standard-risk ALL receiving homogeneous
cancer therapy. Our study findings are important because
they highlight that not all symptoms improve as treatment
proceeds and because they raise awareness that vigilance
1122

for and screening of symptoms are required during
therapy.
Despite the recommendations of Savage et al17 in
2009 that large, longitudinal studies of the specific dimensions of health-related quality of life in children with ALL
be prioritized, there are few such descriptions. Sitaresmi
et al18 describe symptom burden in a cross-sectional study
of 98 children with ALL at various stages of treatment. Half
of the respondents were parents of children with standardrisk ALL, and slightly more than half of the parental assessments (57%) were performed during the maintenance
phase of therapy. No patient-, parent-, or treatment-related
factor, including disease risk stratification, correlated with
the procedure-related anxiety, treatment-related anxiety,
pain, or nausea scores reported by parents.
Sung et al5 also described symptom burden in
children older than 2 years who were receiving ALL treatment. Seventy-five percent of these children had standardrisk leukemia. Mean symptom scores were provided
according to the treatment phase (preceding maintenance
vs during maintenance) for a subset of 137 children. In
agreement with our findings, Sung et al observed
improved procedure- and treatment-related anxiety scores
during maintenance in comparison with scores reported
by parents whose children were in earlier treatment
phases. However, we observed significantly improved
pain scores at each assessment, whereas Sung et al reported
similar pain scores in children before and during maintenance treatment. The differences in our findings may be
due to the fact that Sung et al did not directly capture the
experience during the induction phase.

Anxiety, Pain, and Nausea in ALL/Dupuis et al

Just as others, we observed significant improvements
in procedure- and treatment-related anxiety associated
with increasing elapsed time from the diagnosis.5,18 Our
finding that preschool children are more likely to experience treatment- and procedure-related anxiety has also
been noted by others.18 Nonpharmacological interventions to allay anxiety such as education through storytelling,19 distraction,20 therapeutic clowns,21 and music
therapy22 may be especially useful in this age group.
It is important to appreciate that despite our observation that pain improved with continued ALL treatment,
many children still experience pain well into ALL treatment. Pain due to disease may predominate early in treatment, whereas pain as a result of cancer treatment (eg,
mucositis and neuropathy) or procedures related to cancer
treatment (eg, use of central venous access devices) may be
more problematic with continued therapy. Because pain
can most often be effectively prevented and managed, proactive screening throughout treatment should be the
standard of care.
Nausea was reported to be more problematic during
the last month of delayed intensification than during
induction or maintenance. There is an emerging awareness that nausea represents a symptom that is distinct
from emesis and has a separate pathophysiology.23 Nevertheless, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
(CINV) prophylaxis is selected according to the emetogenicity classification of the planned chemotherapy.24,25
Because little pediatric evidence exists, the current pediatric chemotherapy emetogenicity classification relies highly
on the experience of adult cancer patients.25 Parents
reported the most nausea in children who were allocated
to the most intense treatment arm (intensified consolidation). This arm includes both chemotherapy known to be
highly emetogenic (cyclophosphamide) and prolonged
periods of daily oral and parenteral chemotherapy.
Underappreciation of the emetogenicity of these agents or
their propensity to cause nausea may lead clinicians to
select inadequate antiemetic prophylaxis. In addition,
health care providers generally underappreciate the severity of CINV experienced by ambulatory patients such as
these and may not offer adequate antiemetic prophylaxis
for use at home.26-28 Moreover, clinicians caring for children enrolled in the AALL0331 protocol were advised
against the routine use of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis, and dexamethasone was not given as an antileukemic agent during
consolidation. We, therefore, speculate that most children
in our study did not receive optimal CINV prophylaxis
during treatment with highly and moderately emetogenic

chemotherapy29 and did not have effective antiemetics
available at home to effectively treat breakthrough
CINV.30
The relation between age and the risk for CINV is
not well substantiated in children. In comparison with
very young children (1 month to 2 years), changes in
antiemetic regimens were found to be more likely in children older than 9 years in a retrospective cohort study.31
This may provide indirect evidence of a higher risk of
CINV in older children but may also reflect the increased
ability of older children to advocate for adequate antiemetic therapy. In our study, parents reported more nausea
in older children. It is not possible to determine whether
our finding reflects a greater ability of older children to
communicate the severity of their nausea to their parents,
differences in the antiemetic prophylaxis provided to
young children versus older children, or a true age-based
difference in susceptibility to CINV. Large, prospective
studies are required to determine risk factors for
chemotherapy-induced nausea in children.
This study is limited by the lack of detailed information regarding the variability of supportive-care practices
among participating centers that may influence symptom
burden, including the use and care of central venous access
devices,32 procedure-related sedation and analgesia,
CINV prophylaxis, and types of health care providers
available to the patient (including psychosocial support).
Because we obtained information about the family’s socioeconomic status only at the baseline and used the initial
FAD-GF scores for analysis, our results are not sensitive
to changes in family circumstances over the 12-month
study period. Furthermore, our results may have been
influenced by the association between less severe nausea
and pain reported at the first assessment and the completion of assessments at the third assessment. It is possible
that children with significant pain and nausea were not
fully represented at the later assessment time periods. Our
findings are also limited to children aged 2 to 10 years and
cannot be generalized to infants or adolescents.
In addition, our results may be limited by the use of
proxy reporting of the severity of subjective symptoms.
We were not able to correlate our findings with real-time
clinical assessments of symptom severity, and in comparison with self-reporting by children, parents may underestimate or overestimate the severity of children’s
symptoms.33,34 Indeed, a parent’s ability to cope with his
or her child’s treatment may influence the report of the
child’s symptom severity or the child’s actual symptom severity.32 Child self-report of subjective symptoms is ideal
and should be pursued in future evaluations of symptom

burden and in trials evaluating interventions to prevent or
manage symptoms. This notwithstanding, such tools are
extremely difficult to develop for the age group most commonly diagnosed with ALL, for which the peak age of diagnosis is 1 to 4 years.32,35 Thus, a parent’s perception of
his or her child’s symptom severity will continue to be an
important determinant of symptom severity assessment
and health care intervention, especially for young
children.
The strengths of this report lie in its prospective,
longitudinal design, the large number of participating
centers, and the high participation rates. The participants
were treated with a protocol almost identical to the current standard of care, and our observations are likely to be
generalizable to future children receiving ALL treatment.
We believe that our results represent a real-world example
of the experience of children with ALL.
In conclusion, treatment-related anxiety, procedurerelated anxiety, and pain experienced by children with
ALL, as reported by their parents, progressively decrease
over the course of treatment. Nausea severity is highest 6
months after the diagnosis. It is reassuring that factors
related to the patient’s family circumstances (ie, income
or functioning) do not influence these symptoms. However, there is still room for improvement. Greater attention to nausea control should be paid in delayed
intensification. It may be reasonable to make a special
effort to target interventions to prevent and allay anxiety
in younger children and to prevent chemotherapyinduced nausea in older, ambulatory patients with ALL.
Clinical practice guidelines on these topics would greatly
facilitate the provision of evidence-based care. Future trials evaluating pharmacological and nonpharmacological
interventions aimed at reducing these symptoms should
use validated patient self-report tools to evaluate outcomes
in real time, evaluate the contribution of parental anxiety
to the child’s perception of symptom severity, and explore
the utility of biomarkers for identifying patients at risk of
a higher symptom burden.36,37
