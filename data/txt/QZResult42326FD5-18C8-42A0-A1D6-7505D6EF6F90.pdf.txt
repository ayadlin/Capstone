Abstract:

AXL is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the TAM family, the function of which is poorly
understood. We previously identified AXL overexpression in Imatinib (IM)-resistant
CML cell lines and patients. The present study was conducted to investigate the
role of AXL and the mechanisms underlying AXL overexpression in Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitor (TKI)-resistant CML cells. We present evidence that high AXL expression
level is a feature of TKI-resistant CML cells and knockdown of AXL sensitized TKIresistant cells to IM. In addition, expression of wild-type AXL but not a dominant
negative form of AXL confers IM-sensitive CML cells the capacity to resist IM effect.
AXL overexpression required PKCα and β and constitutive activation of ERK1/2.
Accordingly, GF109203X a PKC inhibitor, U0126 a MEK1 inhibitor and PKCα/β
knockdown restore sensitivity to IM while PKCα or PKCβ overexpression in CML cells
promotes protection against IM-induced cell death. Finally, using luciferase promoter
activity assays we established that AXL is regulated transcriptionally through the
AP1 transcription factor. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of AXL in resistance
to TKI in CML cells, identify the molecular mechanisms involved in its overexpression
and support the notion that AXL is a new marker of resistance to TKI in CML.

Introduction

Nilotinib are now also given as a first line therapy in CML
patients. Nevertheless, resistance to TKI which occurs
in all phases of the disease [8] represents a recurrent
problem for CML patients. Importantly, activation of
tyrosine kinases including LYN, FYN, and AXL has been
reported in IM and Nilotinib-resistant cell lines and also
in some CML patients treated with such inhibitors [9-11].
Therefore, targeting tyrosine kinases, expression of which
is elevated in resistant patients could be a pertinent option
to treat TKI-refractory patients.
We have shown previously that AXL is overexpressed
in CML cell lines resistant to IM and PD166326, a dual
BCR-ABL and SRC kinase inhibitor of the Dasatinib
family. AXL is a member of the TAM family of receptor

A feature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells
is the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) that
results from the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation [1]. The
Ph gene encodes BCR-ABL, an oncogenic fusion protein.
In CML, p210-BCR-ABL is a constitutively activated
tyrosine kinase that triggers several signaling pathways
which collectively confers CML cells a proliferative
advantage and resistance to apoptosis [2-5]. Imatinib
(IM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is used frequently
as the first line treatment for patients suffering CML
[6, 7], even though other TKIs including Dasatinib and

tyrosine kinase (RTK) initially isolated from primary
human myeloid leukemia cells [12]. The TAM receptor
family also includes the Tyro-3 and Mer receptors which
share with AXL subsequent sequence homologies [13].
AXL overexpression is a common feature of cancer cells.
Moreover, increased AXL level and activation have been
linked with Imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GIST) [14], Nilotinib resistance in CML cells
[11], resistance to BMS-754087 in Rhabdomyosarcoma
[15], Lapatinib resistance in HER-2 positive breast tumor
cells [16] and in Cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer [17].
AXL has been also shown to be induced by chemotherapy
drugs in acute myeloid leukemia [18] and AXL is
consistently associated to drug-mediated resistance in
several types of cancer [15, 16, 18, 19]. Although, it seems
well established that AXL is involved in resistance to
chemotherapy in cancer cells, the mechanisms underlying
AXL overexpression in this context remain unexplored.
In the present study, we report compelling evidence
that AXL is overexpressed in several TKI-resistant CML
cell lines. Importantly, we establish that AXL knockdown
using specific siRNA sensitized TKI-resistant cells to IM
effect. Moreover, overexpression of AXL-WT but not
AXL-DN which lacks the kinase domain allowed IMsensitive CML cells to resist IM treatment. Importantly,
we also bring evidence that PKCα and β and constitutive
activation of the ERK1/2 pathway are required for
AXL overexpression in TKI-resistant cells lines.
Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of classical
PKC and MEK1 or PKCα/β silencing by specific siRNA
restores sensitivity to Imatinib while PKCα and PKCβ
overexpression or PMA treatment in TKI-sensitive cells
confers protection against Imatinib-induced cell death. In
addition, luciferase promoter activity assays also indicate
that AXL overexpression is regulated at the transcriptional
level by the AP1 transcription factor in TKI-resistant
cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the role
of AXL in resistance to TKI in CML cells and identify
the involvement of PKC and ERK1/2 pathways in AXL
accumulation. Our data support the notion that AXL could
be a pertinent prognostic marker for resistance to TKI in
CML cells.

absent from the nuclear fraction (Figure 1B). To assess
the level of phosphorylation of AXL, we performed
immuno-precipitation assays from IM-S, IM-R and
PD-R CML cells followed by western blot with the
specific 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody
(Figure 1C). As expected, AXL phosphorylation, which
reflected AXL activity, was found only in IM-R and
PD-R resistant cell lines. To investigate the role of AXL
overexpression in resistance to TKI in K562 CML cells
we used a siRNA approach. A siRNA directed against
AXL efficiently inhibited AXL expression in both IM-R
and PD-R CML cells (Figure 1D, bottom panel). AXL
knockdown by itself had no effect on cell metabolism
but sensitized drastically IM-R and PD-R cells to IMmediated loss of cell metabolism (Figure 1D, top panel)
and also decreased total cell counts (Sup Figure 1A). As
expected, IM abolished the clonogenic potential of IM-S
cells but had minimal effect on IM-R and PD-R CML
cells (Figure 1E). Knockdown of AXL by itself failed
to affect the clonogenic potential of IM-R and PD-R but
strongly reduced the number of colonies when combined
with IM. Indeed, quantitative analysis of colonies counts
by the Image J software revealed a 80% decrease in the
number of IM-R and PD-R colonies in the presence of
the combination of the AXL siRNA and IM versus only
25% with IM alone (Figure 1F). Knockdown of AXL also
sensitized IM-R and PD-R cells to the effect of PD166326
(Sup Figure 1B). By contrast, AXL knockdown did not
modify the effect of staurosporine on cell metabolism
linking specifically AXL expression to IM resistance (Sup
Figure 1C).

Knockdown of AXL induces apoptosis of TKIresistant CML cell lines
To determine whether loss of cell metabolism and
clonogenic potential reflected increased cell death, IM-S,
IM-R and PD-R CML cell lines were treated or not with IM
in the presence or the absence of a siRNA directed against
AXL. As expected IM increased the number of dead cells
from 8 to 28% but had no effect on both IM-R and PD-R
cells (Figure 2A). AXL knockdown restored sensitivity to
IM in both IM-R and PD-R cells to almost the same level
than in control cells (26 and 22% dead cells respectively
versus 33% in IM-S cells). Accordingly, AXL knockdown
specifically increased caspase 3 and 9 activities and PolyADP-Ribose-Polymerase cleavage (Figures 2B, C and
D). To verify that the observed effects were not due to
clonal variations, we also analyzed the IM-resistant cell
line JURLMK1-R. Resistance of JURLMK1-R to IM
was also correlated with overexpression of AXL (Sup
Figure 2A). Identical results were obtained regarding cell
metabolism when JURLMK1-R CML cells were assessed
for annexin V/PI staining and caspase 3 activity (Sup
Figures 2B, C and D). All together our findings show that
increased cell death is one the main mechanisms by which

(A) IM-S, IM-R and PD-R cells were incubated for 48h with 1µM IM. Cell metabolism was measured using the XTT assay (top panel).
Protein extracts were prepared, and 50µg of proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis (bottom panel). (B)
Cell extracts were separated into cytosol, mitochondria and nuclear-enriched fractions and AXL location was assessed by Western blot
in the different fractions. HSP60 and tubulin served as both loading control and validation of the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions,
respectively. (C) Cell extracts were prepared and AXL was immuno-precipitated with an anti-AXL antibody. AXL phosphorylation was
analyzed by western blot using the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. (D) Cells were transfected with control or AXL siRNAs. 48h

of classical and new PKCs, and U0126, a MEK1 inhibitor,
dampened AXL expression in IM-R and PD-R CML cell
lines (data not shown). Therefore both PKC and MEK/
ERK pathways are involved in AXL overexpression in
TKI-resistant CML cell lines. If GFX was capable to inhibit
AXL expression levels in IM-R and PD-R CML cells, it
should sensitize these cells to IM effect. Although GFX
by itself induced only a limited loss of cell metabolism in
TKI-resistant cells, it synergized with IM to promote loss
of cell metabolism in IM-R and PD-R cells (Sup Figure
4A and B). Accordingly, GFX also sensitized IM-R and
PD-R CML cells to IM-induced apoptosis as judged by
increased annexin V staining (Sup Figure 4C) and caspase
3 activity (Sup Figure 4D).

PKCα and β are strongly expressed in K562 cells [21, 22].
Importantly, abrogation of both PKCα and β expression by
a dual PKCα/β siRNA results in a parallel decrease of AXL
expression, irrespectively of the presence or the absence of
IM (Figure 3A). Knockdown of PKCα/β was accompanied
by a sensitization to IM treatment in accordance with the
effect of pharmacological inhibition of PKCs (Figure 3B
and Sup Figure 5B). Importantly, silencing of both PKCα
and β led to an increase in Annexin V staining (Figure 3C)
and caspase 3 activity (Figure 3D) only in TKI-resistant
cells treated with Imatinib. In addition, overexpression of
PKCα or β induced AXL expression in IM-S K562 cells,
while co-expression of both isoforms triggered further
AXL accumulation (Figure 4A). PKCα and β were also
shown to protect IM-S cells from IM-mediated loss of
cell metabolism (Figure 4B) and apoptosis as judged by
AnnexinV/PI staining (Figure 4C) and caspase 3 activity
(Figure 4D), even though co-transfection of both isoforms
conferred further protection.

PKCα and β are responsible for increased AXL
expression in resistant CML cells

As GFX drastically inhibits AXL expression in both

Overexpression of AXL-WT or AXL-DN
differently affects IM-mediated apoptosis

by subcellular fractionation (Figure 6F). Collectively, our
findings support the notion that in IM-resistant CML cells
constitutive activation of the ERK pathway is responsible
for PKCα and β activation.

As previously mentioned, PKCα and β can protect
cells from IM-induced cell death by different mechanisms
including AXL overexpression. To assess the implication
of AXL in CML cell protection, we next overexpressed
a wild-type (AXL-WT) or a kinase deleted mutant of
AXL (AXL-DN) in IM-S K562 cells. We first checked
expression and phosphorylation of AXL in transfected
cells. As shown on Figure 5 A, both forms of AXL protein
were present at a similar level in IM-S cells, but tyrosine
phosphorylation of AXL was detected only in cells
transfected with the wild-type construct. Importantly,
AXL-WT but not AXL-DN over-expression conferred
IM-S cells protection against IM-induced loss of cell
metabolism (Figure 5B), apoptosis as judged by Annexin
V/PI staining (Figure 5C) and caspase 3 activity (Figure
5D). Importantly, no protective effect was observed with
AXL-DN indicating that the protective effect of AXL was
strictly dependent on its kinase activity. The protection
triggered by AXL overexpression although not complete
was equivalent to the one induced by PKCα or β (Figure
4) suggesting that AXL is one if not the main cause of
resistance to IM in IM-R and PD-R CML cell lines.
When the same experiments were reproduced in IM-R
cells, increased level of AXL-WT and AXL-DN were
detected (Figure 5E). Overexpression of AXL-WT in
IM-R cells failed to alter cell metabolism, whereas AXLDN inhibited drastically cell metabolism in the presence
of IM (Figure 5F). This was also correlated with increased
cell death as assessed by Annexin V/PI staining (Figure
5G) and caspase 3 assay (Figure 5H).

AP1 is required for AXL overexpression in TKIresistant CML cells
To get insights into the mechanisms of AXL
regulation in CML cells we performed luciferase activity
assays using a minimal AXL promoter carrying or not a
mutation on its AP1 binding site. Promoter activity was
8 and 6 times higher in IM-R and PD-R cells respectively
compared to control cells, reflecting increased AXL
transcription in these cell lines (Figure 7A). When using
the mutated promoter there was an 80% decrease in
luciferase activity arguing for an important role of AP1
in AXL overexpression. AXL transcription was abolished
by U0126 highlighting the role of ERK1/2 in this process
(Figure 7B). Accordingly, knockdown of PKCα/β was
associated with a drastic inhibition of AXL transcription
in IM-R and PD-R CML cells (Figure 7C). Finally,
overexpression of PKCα or PKCβ triggered activation of
the AXL promoter, the combination of both being more
efficient that the individual expression of one of these
isoforms (Figure 7D). Finally, it is worth noting that the
level of activation of the AXL promoter was identical
whatever the situation in TKI-resistant cells and IM-S
cells transfected with the combination of PKCα and β,
highlighting the role of PKCs in the regulation of AXL.

Discussion
We report here that over-expression of the RTK
AXL is consistently detected in several TKI-resistant
CML cell lines and that silencing of AXL with specific
siRNA sensitizes TKI-resistant cells to IM-mediated loss
of cell viability and apoptosis. We also bring evidence that
a WT, but not a dominant-negative AXL protein lacking
the kinase domain, confers IM-sensitive cells the capacity
to resist IM treatment. Pharmacological inhibition of
classical PKC and MEK1 or PKCα/β silencing by specific
siRNA restores sensitivity to IM while PKCα and PKCβ
overexpression in TKI-sensitive cells confers protection
against IM-induced cell death demonstrating that both
PKCα and β and constitutive activation of ERK1/2 are
required for AXL overexpression. In addition, we show
that AXL overexpression is regulated at the transcriptional
level by the AP1 transcription factor in TKI-resistant cells.

Role of ERK1/2 activation in AXL overexpression
We reported earlier that ERK1/2 is constitutively
activated in IM-R CML cells [20]. Accordingly, AXL
overexpression correlated also with persistent activation
of ERK1/2 in IM-R and PD-R CML cells (Figure 6A).
Interestingly, inhibition of ERK1/2 by the MEK1 inhibitor
U0126 abolished AXL expression (Figure 6A). In addition
U0126 also sensitized TKI-resistant CML cells to IM
(Figure 6B). Finally, U0126 increased both IM-induced
annexin V/PI staining (Figure 6C) and caspase 3 activity
(Figure 6D) in IM-R and PD-R CML cell lines. Taken
together our data established that ERK1/2 is required for
AXL expression upstream of PKCα and β in TKI-resistant
CML cell lines. In addition, Figure 6E showed that IMS, IM-R and PD-R cell lines expressed the same level of
PKCα and β expression and phosphorylation. Importantly,
U0126 significantly inhibited expression of PKCα and
β in IM-R and PD-R cells but not in their IM-sensitive
counterpart. Translocation rather than global expression of
both PKC isoforms was impaired in IM-R cells as judged

chemotherapy in gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell lines
[14], in CML cells [11], rhabdomyosarcoma [15], HER2 positive breast tumor cells [16] and ovarian cancer
[17]. In addition, AXL has been shown to be induced
by chemotherapy drugs in acute myeloid leukemia [18].
Accordingly, a recent study has reported that inhibition
of AXL expression in Nilotinib-resistant CML cells lines
can restore sensitivity to Nilotinib [11]. Indeed, Gioia et
al. showed that AXL interacts with both Syk and Lyn to
mediate resistance to Nilotinib in the K562 CML cell line.
Interestingly, these Nilotinib-resistant CML cells were
shown to display constitutive activation of Lyn a situation
that is closed to the one observed in our TKI-resistant

K562 cell lines where the Fyn but not Lyn tyrosine
kinase is constitutively activated and participates to
persistent ERK1/2 activation [9, 10, 20]. Therefore, AXL
activation in TKI-resistant CML cells could be achieved
by two different but complementary pathways, increased
signaling or increased protein expression, both leading to
resistance to TKIs. It has been reported that dominantnegative inhibition of AXL suppresses brain tumor growth
and invasion and prolongs survival in a mice model of
gliomagenesis [23]. This was the first direct proof that the
tyrosine kinase activity of AXL can be involved in tumor
progression. Accordingly, we established here using AXLDN constructs that AXL activity is necessary to confer
resistance to IM-sensitive cells.

time evidence that PKCα and β are also involved in AXL
overexpression. This observation is in good agreement
with the fact that AXL has been identified initially as a
gene induced by phorbol esters in CML cells [21, 27, 28].

It is well established that AXL stimulated cell

required for increased transcription of AXL in IM-R cells.
Importantly, pharmacological and siRNA approaches
allowed us to determine that increased transcription and
expression of AXL in TKI-resistant cells are dependent
on both ERK and PKCα and β signaling. One important
question that remains to be answered is whether ERK1/2
and PKC act independently to promote AXL accumulation
in TKI-resistant or whether it exist a hierarchy of
activation of these kinase pathways. Importantly, we
established the hierarchy of kinase activation leading to
AXL overexpression. Indeed, we showed that ERK1/2
is involved upstream of PKCα and β to regulate AXL
expression in TKI-resistant CML cells since inhibition of
MEK1 by U0126 abrogated PKCα and β translocation and
as consequence on AXL expression only in IM-resistant
cells. Collectively our finding supports the notion that
the constitutive activation of ERK in TKI-resistant cells
control translocation and activity of PKCα and β which in
turn are involved in increased transcription and expression
of AXL.

true regarding CML and AML. Moreover, increased
expression of AXL is often associated to chemotherapy
drug resistance [15, 16, 18, 19]. Therefore, targeting AXL
could represent a promising strategy for TKI-resistant
patients. Until now, no specific inhibitors of AXL have
been characterized. MP470 is reported to inhibit AXL
in vitro and in vivo [14] but is also effective at identical
concentrations on other RTKs [33, 34]. For instance,
MP470 was found effective to sensitize the IM-resistant
GIST882 cell line to IM, but it is not known from the
results of this study whether this effect is due to effective
AXL inhibition. In this line, we have shown that MP470
efficiently killed IM-R K562 cells. However, MP470 was
found to affect IM-S K562 cell as well, strongly suggesting
that at least in the case of CML, AXL is not an MP470
target. In the absence of highly specific AXL inhibitor the
use of siRNA directed against AXL have however brought
clear evidence that AXL is involved in TKI-resistance.
The development of highly specific inhibitors of AXL
will certainly help deciphering further the role of this
RTK in resistance to TKI and to propose new therapeutic
strategies in hematopoietic malignancies [35].

Findings from other and our present data clearly
indicate that increased expression of AXL is a common

resistant JURLMK1 cell clones (JURLMK1-R) have been
described previously [9].

Reagents and antibodies:

Colony formation assay:

Imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec) was purchased
from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY, USA) and
RPMI 1640 medium, IMDM medium and fetal calf
serum (FCS) from life technologies (Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Sodium fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, leupeptin
and Phorbol-12-Myristate-13-Acetate (PMA) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (France). Ac-DEVD7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), Ac-LEHD-AMC,
Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-LEHD-CHO and zVAD-fmk
were from peptanova (PeptaNova GmbH, Sandhausen,
Germany). Anti-HSP90, anti-HSP60, anti-tubulin and
anti-AXL antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). HRP conjugated
anti-mouse and anti-goat antibodies were from Dakopatts
(Glostrup, Denmark). Anti-phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr), antiPARP, anti-PKCα, anti-PKCβ, anti-PKCγ, anti-phosphoERK, and peroxydase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
MA, USA). Staurosporine, U0126, SP600125, SU6656,
GF109203X, PP2 and SB202474 were from Calbiochem
(San Diego, USA).

IM (1µM) was added to cells lines growing in
semisolid methylcellulose medium (0.5x103 cells/ml;
MethoCult H4236; StemCell Technologies Inc, Vancouver,
BC, Canada). Colonies were detected after 10 days of
culture by adding 1 mg/ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent
and were scored by Image J quantification software (U.S.
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) [37].

Caspase assays:
Caspase assays have been described in details
elsewhere [4].

Flow cytometry:
Apoptosis analysis: After stimulation, cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS and were stained with the
annexin-V-fluos staining kit (Roche, Meylan, France)
according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Fluorescence
was measured by using the FL2 channels of a fluorescenceactivated cell sorter apparatus (Miltenyi cytometer).

RNA interference:

Western blot:

AXL
(UCGCGGUGCUGGGAGCUAA)
and
PKCα/β (life technologies) specific siRNAs from Life
Technologies were transfected in cells using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX reagent as described previously [36].

After stimulation, cells were harvested and lysed in
buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics).
Lysates were pelleted, and 50 µg of protein were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE as described previously [38].

Plasmids and luciferase reporter constructs:

Preparation of cytoplasmic, microsomal and
nuclear fractions:

AXL-WT and AXL-DN (kinase-deleted) plasmids
have been published elsewhere [23] and were kindly
provided by Pr Axel Ullrich. PKCα and PKCβ have been
described previously [22]. Luciferase reporter constructs
of the AXL promoter were kindly provided by Dr Heile
Allgayer. pAXL-WT represents the WT luciferase reporter
construct (−1276/+7) and pAXL-AP1mut corresponds to
luciferase reporter construct mutated into position (-637
to -650 AP1 corresponding to the AP1 binding site) [27].

After stimulation, cells were washed and lysed as
described previously [36]. Proteins contained in cytosolic,
microsomal and nuclear fractions were separated by
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane before
incubation with specific antibodies.
