BACKGROUND: The prognostic and therapeutic implications of the spectrum of v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) oncogene substitutions in lung cancer remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether
KRAS oncogene substitutions differed with regard to prognosis or predictive value in lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: KRAS
oncogene substitutions and mutant allele-specific imbalance (MASI) were determined in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and the
associations with overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and chemotherapy interactions were assessed. RESULTS: KRAS
mutational analysis was performed on 988 lung adenocarcinomas, and 318 KRAS mutations were identified. In this predominantly
early stage cohort (78.6% of patients had stage I-III disease), OS and RFS did not differ according to the type of KRAS substitution
(OS, P ¼ .612; RFS, P ¼ .089). There was a trend toward better OS in the subset of patients with KRAS codon 13 mutations (P ¼ .052),
but that trend was not significant in multivariate analysis (P ¼ .076). RFS did not differ according to codon type in univariate analysis
(P ¼ .322). There was a marked difference in RFS based on the presence of MASI in univariate analysis (P ¼ .004) and multivariate
analysis (P ¼ .009). A test for interaction was performed to determine whether the effect of chemotherapy on OS and RFS differed
based on KRAS substitution type, codon type, or the presence of MASI. That test indicated that there were no differences in the
effects of chemotherapy for any of variables examined. CONCLUSIONS: KRAS codon 13 mutations and MASI were identified as candidate biomarkers for prognosis, and it may be useful to incorporate them into prospective studies evaluating novel therapies in KRASC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States.1 Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
accounts for 85% of all lung cancers, whereas small ell lung cancer accounts for about 15%.2 Historically treated as a single
disease entity, the identification of driver mutations and the development of molecularly targeted agents against the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene have permanently
shifted the landscape of NSCLC therapy toward a personalized approach.
Data from the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium indicate that, of 1000 tumors from patients with lung adenocarcinoma, mutations in the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) were the most prevalent of the
driver mutations, identified in 25% of all cases.3 The presence of a KRAS mutation is thought to have prognostic implications with regard to survival; in a meta-analysis of studies assessing RAS mutations in lung adenocarcinomas, the presence
of a RAS mutation was associated with a 50% relative increase in the risk of death.4 However, the prognostic implications
of RAS mutations have not been validated in a prospective fashion.
The predictive properties of KRAS mutations were explored in a molecular analysis of the patients included in the
JBR.10 clinical trial, which evaluated the role of cisplatin and vinorelbine in the adjuvant setting.5 In that analysis, KRAS
mutations were neither prognostic of survival nor predictive of a differential benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Retrospective studies in the metastatic setting have failed to demonstrate a differential chemotherapy effect based on the presence or absence of a KRAS mutation.6,7 The predictive value of individual KRAS oncogene substitutions was explored in a
pooled analysis of trials evaluating the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal
cancer.8 In that study, patients with a G13D KRAS oncogene substitution derived greater benefit from cetuximab-based

chemotherapy compared with patients with G12D and
other KRAS oncogene substitutions, suggesting clinical
heterogeneity among subtypes of KRAS mutations.
Furthermore, the significance of KRAS gene copy
number change is uncertain. It has been observed that
KRAS mutations may be associated with a higher KRAS
gene copy number.9-11 The combination of mutations and
copy number gain may result in an imbalance between the
wild-type allele (W) and the mutant allele (M), which may
results in a situation in which M is predominant over W, a
scenario defined as mutant allele-specific imbalance
(MASI).12 The incomplete dominance of M over W is
most frequently a result of selective amplification of M, but
it may also be because of the presence only of M in the absence of W, as in acquired uniparental disomy, which frequently leads to complete MASI.13 Recent reports suggest
that the combination of a KRAS mutation and copy number gain may be associated with adverse outcomes in
patients with lung and colon adenocarcinoma.12,14,15
The objective of the current study was to assess
whether the spectrum of KRAS oncogene substitutions
differs with regard to their clinical behavior, specifically
examining the type of KRAS amino acid (AA) substitution
present, the presence of a codon 12 versus codon 13 mutation, and the presence or absence of MASI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a retrospective analysis of banked tumor specimens that were collected from patients with newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) between 2005 and
2011. All formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens
that remained after complete pathologic sign out of the
case were considered for inclusion in the study and were
selected on the basis of meeting a minimum tissue requirement of 300 cells per sample. Guided by hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E)-stained slides, tumor targets that contained
>70% tumor cells were manually microdissected from
the 4-lm unstained histologic sections. Mutational analysis of KRAS codons 12 and 13 was then performed as previously described.16 Briefly, DNA was isolated from each
target using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
Calif) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced in both
the sense and antisense directions using the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 cycle-sequencing kit on an ABI 3130
automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster
City, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The sequences were analyzed using Mutation Surveyor
software (SoftGenetics, LLC, State College, Penn). SamCancer

ples were classified as mutated or wild type for KRAS
based on the sequencing results. MASI was determined in
a semiquantitative fashion on sequencing electropherograms and was defined as a KRAS mutant peak greater
than the wild-type peak on (M > W) or a mutant peak
equal to the wild-type peak (M ¼ W), and no MASI was
defined as a mutant peak less than a wild-type peak (M <
W) (Fig. 1A).
Baseline demographics, staging, and smoking history were obtained through a review of the medical record
in the UPMC Medical Archival System. First-line treatment data, follow-up data with regard to first recurrences,
and survival were collected through the UPMC Network
Cancer Registry. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated either from the date of
surgery (in patients with stage I to III disease) or from the
date of a diagnostic biopsy (in patients with stage IV disease) to the date of recurrence or death, respectively.
Patients who had <30 days of follow-up were excluded
from the survival analyses. Those patients who did not experience the event of interest were censored at the date of
their last follow-up. Survival probabilities were estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard
models were used to examine the effects of KRAS mutations and MASI on OS and RFS while controlling for age,
sex, race, smoking history, disease stage, and receipt of
chemotherapy. Only significant factors were left in the
final model with the type of KRAS mutation or MASI. A
test for interaction was used to determine whether the
effect of the KRAS mutation or MASI was modified by
the receipt chemotherapy both in patients with resected
stage I to III disease (either neoadjuvant or adjuvant
chemotherapy) and in the metastatic setting. This study
was conducted under an exemption approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.

RESULTS
By using the inclusion criterion of 300 cells per sample,
988 tumor specimens that were collected between 2005
and 2011 were sequenced for KRAS mutations. Of those
tumors, 318 (32.2%) harbored KRAS mutations, the majority of which were codon 12 mutations (298 tumors;
93.7%). Glycine-to-cysteine (GLY!CYS) AA substitutions were the most common codon 12 (139 tumors;
46.6%) and codon 13 (10 tumors; 58.8%) oncogene substitutions (Table 1). This was predominantly an early
stage cohort, consisting of 143 patients (45%) with stage I
disease, 52 patients (16.4%) with stage II disease, 55
patients (17.3%) with stage III disease, and 64 patients

follow-up was 24.3 months (range, 0-6.5 years).
OS did not differ according to the type of KRAS AA
substitution either in univariate analysis (P ¼ .612) (Fig.
2A) or in multivariate analysis adjusting for age and stage
(P ¼ .287). Similarly, RFS did not differ according to the
type of KRAS AA substitution either in univariate analysis
(P ¼ .089) (Fig. 2B) or in multivariate analysis adjusting
for stage (P ¼ .126). It is noteworthy that there was a
trend toward better OS in the subset of patients with
KRAS codon 13 mutations (P ¼ .052) (Fig. 2C); however,
this trend was not statistically significant in multivariate
analysis adjusting for age and stage (P ¼ .076). In addition, RFS did not differ according to codon type either in
univariate analysis (P ¼ .322) (Fig. 2D) or in multivariate
analysis adjusting for stage (P ¼ .318). However, RFS
differed significantly according to MASI status both in
univariate analysis (P ¼ .004) (Fig. 1B) and in multivariate analysis controlling for stage (P ¼ .009). Controlling
for stage, MASI, defined as M > W (hazard ratio, 2.42;
95% confidence interval, 1.06-5.52) or M ¼ W (hazard
ratio, 3.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-11.44), was
associated with a greater risk of recurrence compared with
no MASI (M < W) (Fig. 1C).

Next, we examined whether KRAS mutation subtypes differed with regard to the predictive value of a
chemotherapy benefit. A test for interaction was performed to determine whether the effect of chemotherapy
on OS differed based on the type of KRAS AA substitution
present, the codon type, or the presence or absence of
MASI. Adjusting for age and stage, there were no differences in the effects of chemotherapy for any of the variables
examined (AA substitution, P ¼ .795; codon type, P ¼
.438; and MASI, P ¼ .598) on OS (Table 2). A similar
test for interaction was performed for RFS among patients
who had resected stage I through III disease to explore
whether there were any differences with regard to the
effects of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant
settings. In that analysis, no interaction was observed
between the AA substitution (P ¼ .357), the codon type
(P ¼ .790), or MASI status (P ¼ .392) and a chemotherapy benefit (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In the largest published series of KRAS mutant lung
adenocarcinomas to date, we report no differences in
prognosis based on the type of KRAS AA substitution
present, a trend toward better survival among patients

with the presence of KRAS MASI. It is important to note
that this was largely an early stage cohort, which is likely a
reflection of the minimum tissue requirement needed for
inclusion in the analysis.

In cell line models, KRAS codon 12 mutations
appear to be a more potent oncogenic driver compared
with codon 13 mutations, inducing a higher level of resistance to apoptosis and a predisposition toward anchorageindependent growth.17 Remarkably, in the small number
of patients with codon 13 mutations in the current study,
there was a trend toward better OS in univariate analysis,
which did not remain significant in multivariate analysis
adjusting for age and stage. In a molecular analysis of
1532 patients who were included in the Lung Adjuvant
Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE) meta-analysis, in total, 300
KRAS mutations were identified. KRAS mutations, considered neither as a whole nor as subsets of AA substitutions or codon types, had prognostic value in the resected
early stage setting.18,19 Ultimately, KRAS codon 13 mutations are infrequent in number (there were 24 codon 13
mutations in the LACE meta-analysis and 17 in the current study). Thus, a robust analysis to further delineate
the true prognostic value of KRAS codon 13 in lung adenocarcinoma will require pooling of codon 13 mutations
across institutions to obtain an adequate number of
patients.
In the relapsed metastatic setting, an analysis of
KRAS AA substitutions in patients who were treated on
the Biomarker-integrated Approach of Targeted Therapy
for Lung Cancer Elimination (BATTLE) trial demonstrated 48 KRAS mutations among 268 tumors profiled.
The presence of a GLY!CYS or GLY!VAL substitution at codon 12 was associated with significantly worse
progression-free survival (PFS) compared with the other
KRAS AA substitutions or wild-type KRAS.20 Sixty-four
patients with KRAS-mutant stage IV disease were
included in the current analysis, and we were unable to
demonstrate an association between KRAS AA substitution subtypes and survival (both OS and RFS) in a multivariate analysis controlling for stage. It should be noted
that the BATTLE clinical trial reflects a refractory
NSCLC population as distinct from the current population, which represents a predominantly early stage and
first-line metastatic cohort. Cell line data indicate that
codon 12 GLY!CYS and GLY!VAL mutations are
associated with activated Ral signaling and decreased factor-dependent Akt activation.20 The difference in the
prognostic significance of individual AA substitutions
between the current study and the BATTLE analysis may
be a reflection of a distinct biology between the relapsed
metastatic setting and the adjuvant or first-line metastatic
setting.

direct sequencing is a valid method for quantifying MASI

manual microdissection limits the proportion of nontumor DNA in a given sample. The presence of remaining
nontumor DNA would randomly affect all specimens,
and nontumor DNA increases the wild-type peak and
decreases the mutant:wild-type peak ratio, thereby
decreasing the ability to detect MASI on sequencing
electropherograms.
We demonstrated that the presence of KRAS mutant
MASI was associated with a markedly inferior RFS compared with the absence of MASI. In prior studies, we demonstrated that the presence of MASI also was associated
with worse OS, mirroring the adverse RFS with MASI
observed in the current study.21 The presence of MASI is
frequently associated with KRAS amplification, as demonstrated by fluorescent in situ hybridization studies.21 This
suggests that the KRAS mutant:wild-type peak ratio
observed on sequencing electropherograms is representative of the actual KRAS mutant allele:wild-type allele ratio
within the tumor. This allelic imbalance is a reflection
both of the post-transcriptional dosage of the KRAS allele
and its concomitant kinase activity. Although amplification may account for KRAS MASI, other potential mechanisms may include uniparental disomy, chromosome 12
hyperdiploidy, or KRAS homozygous mutation. The
implications of KRAS MASI will require prospective validation as a biomarker of prognosis.
In the current study, there was no suggestion of a
predictive value for chemotherapy benefit among the subtypes of KRAS AA substitutions, among the subtypes of
KRAS codons, or among the subpopulations with or without MASI. In both the JBR.10 clinical trial and the LACE
meta-analysis, KRAS mutations considered as a whole

were not associated with differential chemotherapy effectiveness.5,18 In an analysis of patients who were included
in the LACE meta-analysis according to KRAS mutation
subtypes, the subset of patients with KRAS codon 13
mutations fared worse with adjuvant chemotherapy relative to the observation arm.19 In drawing a comparison
with the LACE meta-analysis, KRAS codon 13 mutations
in the current study were associated with a nonstatistically
significant trend toward worse OS and RFS with chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy. However, the number
of patients in those subanalyses was small, and the resultant confidence intervals were wide.
The major limitation of these predictive analyses
(which also applies to the prognostic analyses) is that they
represent a biomarker analysis that was not conducted in
the context of a prospective randomized clinical trial.
Comparisons in this study were made between KRAS
mutation subtypes and not relative to a wild-type population, limiting our ability to draw conclusions from our
predictive analyses. However, the aims of this study were
to ascertain whether there were differences in prognosis
and predictive benefit between different types of KRAS
mutations and not necessarily between KRAS-mutant and
KRAS wild-type lung adenocarcinomas. The KRAS wildtype population itself is a molecularly heterogeneous population; that is, it includes a significant proportion of
patients who are KRAS wild-type but whose tumors harbor other oncogenic drivers, such as EGFR mutations or
ALK translocations, among others.3 Therefore, we chose
to focus the current analyses on a purely KRAS-mutant
cohort. This study is meant to be hypothesis-generating,
and the incorporation of these candidate biomarkers in a
