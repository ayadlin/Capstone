ABSTRACT:

Here we demonstrate the crucial role of CKS1B in multiple myeloma (MM) progression
and define CKS1B-mediated SKP2/p27Kip1-independent down-stream signaling
pathways. Forced-expression of CKS1B in MM cells increased cell multidrug-resistance.
CKS1B activates STAT3 and MEK/ERK pathways. In contrast, SKP2 knockdown or
p27Kip1 over-expression resulted in activation of the STAT3 and MEK/ERK pathways.
Further investigations showed that BCL2 is a downstream target of MEK/ERK signaling.
Stimulation of STAT3 and MEK/ERK signaling pathways partially abrogated CKS1B
knockdown induced MM cell death and growth inhibition. Targeting STAT3 and MEK/
ERK signaling pathways by specific inhibitors induced significant MM cell death and
growth inhibition in CKS1B-overexpressing MM cells and their combinations resulted
in synergy. Thus, our findings provide a rationale for targeting STAT3 and MEK/ERK/
BCL2 signaling in aggressive CKS1B-overexpressing MM.

INTRODUCTION

supporting the hypothesis that 1q21 gain may be important
in MM progression. High expression of CKS1B, a Cdc28
protein kinase regulatory subunit 1B, mapping to the 1q21
amplicon [2] and one of the 70 high-risk signature gene
pattern, has been shown to be inversely related with survival in MM [3]. Additionally, knockdown of CKS1B in
MM cells potently induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, suggesting that CKS1B plays a crucial role in MM
cell survival [4]. However, the functional role of CKS1B
in MM cell survival and MM disease progression remains
to be elucidated.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy,
which remains largely incurable with current therapeutic
strategies. The molecular bases of MM progression and
drug-resistance are not completely understood. Gain of
chromosome 1q21 is one of the most recurrent chromosomal aberrations observed in MM and correlates with
disease progression [1]. We previously identified a 70 highrisk signature pattern in MM, with over-representation of
over-expressed genes mapping to chromosome 1q, further

CKS1B has a well-documented role in the cell-cycle
regulation. Cks1 is a member of the Cks/Suc1 family of
proteins, which are essential components of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that regulate mitosis in all eukaryotes
[5]. CKS1B was identified as an essential accessory protein
to the SCFSKP2-CKS1 ubiquitin ligase complex [6-8]. In this
complex, Cks1 enhances the interaction between SKP2 and
p27Kip1 (a CDK inhibitor), resulting in cell proliferation
[9]. The role of Cks1 in regulating p27Kip1 proteasome degradation in the cell cycle is particularly evident in CKS1–/–
mice. The key feature of these mice is their small body size,
which is due to lack of cell proliferation, secondary due
to lack of degradation of the G1-/S-phase CDK inhibitor
p27Kip1[6]. Interestingly, besides influencing cell growth
and survival through regulation of p27Kip1, silencing of
CKS1B also induces cell death and inhibits growth in MM
cells in the presence of a bi-allelic deletion of the CDKN1B
(p27Kip1) locus, indicating that CKS1B mediates its effects
on cell growth and survival also through mechanisms that
are independent p27Kip1 and SKP2 [4].
In this study, we found that forced expression of CKS1B

by lentivirus vector-mediated CKS1B-cDNA transfection
in MM cells increased drug-resistance, providing direct
evidence of the crucial role of CKS1B in MM progression.
Furthermore, we also identified STAT3 and MEK/ERK/
BCL2 pathways to be downstream targets of CKS1B activation independent on the complex of SKP2/p27Kip1.
RESULTS
CKS1B expression is increased in relapsed MM and
confers a short post-relapse survival.
Our previous studies showed that CKS1B was one
of the 70 high-risk genes, inversely associated with survival in newly diagnosed MM [3]. We compared CKS1B
expression in 51 patients with paired baseline (diagnostic) and relapse samples. The median signals of CKS1B
from microarray data at diagnosis and at relapse were 1398
(range: 370 ~ 4433) and 2174 (range: 405 ~ 9867), respectively. CKS1B expression increased in 76% of relapsed

Fig. 1. Increased CKS1B expression in relapsed myeloma links a short postrelapse survival.
(A) CKS1B signal for 51 paired arrays was obtained at diagnosis and relapse. The high risk (quartile
4) reference line is taken from the complete (n=351) sample of arrays at diagnosis. Note that a majority of samples showed increased expression at relapse; the most dramatic changes were observed
in patients with expression levels in quartiles 1–3 at diagnosis. A paired Student t test was used to
compare log-scale signal at diagnosis and relapse. (B) Kaplan-Meier analysis of postrelapse survival
is shown in relation to CKS1B expression from low expression at baseline (BL-Low) to low expression
at relapse (RL-Low; n = 15) and BL-Low to high expression at relapse (RL-High; n = 23) and already
high expression at baseline (BL-High; n = 13) determined by microarray. At the time of analysis, the
median follow-up of a post-relapse survival was 14 months (range, 0.3 to 50 months) in this analysis..

MMs and was more than 1.5 fold higher in 51% (Figure
1A; p = 2.39× 10-5).
As we expected, patients, who had CKS1B expression
in quartile 4 (high-risk) at baseline and receiving various
salvage therapies had the worst 4-year post-relapse survival
(Figure 1B; p = 0.0012). The quartile 4 reference line is
taken from the complete sample (n= 351) of arrays at diagnosis [3, 10]. Interestingly, among 38/51 relapsed patients
with low CKS1B expression (quartiles 1 ~ 3) at baseline,
but who showed increased CKS1B expression of at least
1.5 fold at relapse had inferior 4-year post-relapse survival compared with those lacking a 1.5 fold CKS1B upregulation at relapse (Figure 1B; p = 0.032). Furthermore,
among 36 relapsed patients with high CKS1B expression
at relapse, the 4-year post-relapse survival of those with
high CKS1B at baseline and at relapse was significantly
worse compared with that of patients with high CKS1B
expression only at relapse (Figure 1B; p = 0.0247). These
data further confirm that CKS1B expression is a prognositic

marker especially at diagnosis, but also at relapse.
CKS1B over-expression promotes MM cell drug-resistance
Increased expression of CKS1B is a progression event,
but it is possible that CKS1B may be heterogeneously
expressed in myeloma cells at diagnosis, and current treatments ineffectively eliminate the small populations of
CKS1B high-expression myeloma cells, leading to relapse.
To test the hypothesis that MM cells with high expression
of CKS1B are more drug-resistance and responsible for
MM relapse, CKS1B was over-expressed in OCI-MY5 and
XG-1 MM cells by lentivirus vector-mediated CKS1BcDNA transfection (Figure 2A). CKS1B-transfected OCIMY5 and XG-1 cells were treated with bortezomib (Vel)
at a dose of 5 nM for 48 hours. Cell growth and cell survival were examined. Untreated and EV-transfected cells
with or without bortezomib served as controls. As shown

Fig. 2. CKS1B over-expression promotes myeloma cell drug-resistance. (A) Western blots examined CKS1B
proteins increased in CKS1B-transfected OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells (CKS1B-OE). (B - G) MM cells overexpressed
CKS1B showed multi-drug resistance. CKS1B-over-expressing OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells were treated with bortezomib (Vel; 5 nM), doxorubicin (Dox; 100 nM), and etoposide (Epo; 100 nM) for 48 hours in the cultures, and
cell growth (B, OCI-MY5: 0.11M vs. 0.75M, and XG1: 0.06M vs. 0.65M; D, OCI:-MY5: 0.11M vs. 0.47M, and
XG1: 0.19M vs. 0.54M; F, OCI-MY5: 0.21 vs. 0.39M, and XG1: 0.19 vs. 0.47M) and death (C,OCI-MY5: 34% vs.
63%, and XG1: 20% vs. 54%; E, OCI-MY5: 38% vs. 77%, and XG1: 53% vs. 81%; G, OCI-MY5: 41% vs. 71%,
and XG1: 32% vs. 59%) were evaluated for these three treatments respectively. Untreated and EV cells with or
without drug treatment were used as controls. Results were expressed as Mean+SD of three independent experiments (*p <0 .05).

in Figure 2B & 2C, bortezomib treatment induced significantly less growth inhibition (Figure 2B) and cell death
(Figure 2C) in CKS1B-transfected cells compared with
EV-transfected controls (p <0 .05). Similarly, treatment of
doxorubicin (Dox) 100nM (Figure 2D & 2E) and etoposide
(Epo) 100nM (Figure 2F & 2G) for 48 hours, induced significantly less growth inhibition and cell death in CKS1Btransfected cells compared with EV-transfected controls (p
< 0.05).

cells and cells transfected with a non-targeting, scramble
sequence (SCR) (Figure 3A & 3B). Similar results were
also observed in CKS1B silenced KMS28PE and XG-1
cells (Figure 3B). We further examined the alteration of
STAT3, MEK/ERK and BCL2 in CKS1B-transfected OCIMY5 and XG-1 cells. As shown in Figure 3C, increased
levels of p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, p-STAT3 and p-BCL2
were observed in CKS1B-transfected OCI-MY5 and XG-1
cells compared with the EV-transfected controls. These
results strongly suggest STAT3, MEK/ERK, and BCL2 are
the downstream signaling targets of CKS1B.
To examine the functional independence of SKP2
and CKS1B, SKP2-shRNA was used to silence SKP2 in
KMS28PE, OCI-MY5, and XG-1 cells and protein levels
of p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2, p-STAT3, and p-BCL2 in these
cells were examined. Wild-type (WT) and SCR-transfected
cells were used as controls. As shown in Figure 3D, SKP2knockdown resulted in an increase rather than a decrease of
p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2 and p-STAT3 levels in KMS28PE,
OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells, with no remarkable changes in
p-BCL2 level. We then examined the functional relationship between p27Kip1 and STAT3, MEK/ERK and BCL2
by over-expressing p27Kip1 in KMS28PE, OCI-MY5 and

CKS1B over-expression activates STAT3 and MEK/
ERK through SKP2 and p27Kip1-independent pathways.
To identify these CKS1B-mediated SKP2/p27Kip1-independent signaling pathways, western blots were applied to
screen for activation of the key signaling pathways which
relate to MM cell survival and apoptosis, including MAPK,
NF-κB, TP53, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 using OCI-MY5
cells after CKS1B-silencing by specific CKS1B-sh+RNA
transfection. Decreased phosphorylated (p)-MEK1/2,
p-ERK1/2, p-STAT3 and p-BCL2 levels were detected in
CKS1B silenced OCI-MY5 cells compared with wild-type

knocked down in KMS28PE, OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells. Cells were cultured for 72 hours and cell
lysates were prepared. (A) CKS1B-induced signaling pathways were screened by western blots in
CKS1B-knockdown (CKS1B-sh) OCI-MY5 cells using the indicated antibodies. (B) Protein levels of
p-STAT3, p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2 and p-BCL2 were examined in KMS28PE, OCI-MY5 and XG1 cells

and p-BCL2 were examined by western blot analysis in CKS1B-transfected, SKP2-silenced, and
p27 Kip1-transfected MM cell lines of OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells, respectively. WT and EV cells were
used as controls and β-actin was used as loading control.

XG-1 cells using a lentivirus system. Western blots detected
increased levels of p-STAT3, p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2
in p27Kip1-transfected myeloma cells with no remarkable
effect on p-BCL2 levels (Figure 3E) compared with WT
and EV controls.

myeloma cells with higher CKS1B-expression levels are
more sensitive to STAT3 inhibition than cells with lower
CKS1B-expression.
Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) is a well-recognized
myeloma cell survival factor [10, 11] activating the STAT3
signaling pathway [12] . To further confirm the functional
role of STAT3 signaling in CKS1B-mediated myeloma cell
growth and survival, CKS1B-silenced KMS28PE, OCIMY5 and XG-1 cells were treated with IGF-1 (100ng/ml)
for 72 hours. Western-blots detected increased p-STAT3
in these CKS1B-silenced myeloma cells compared with
untreated, SCR- or CKS1B-shRNA-transfected controls
(Figure 4D), confirming activation of STAT3 in IGF-1treated cells. The effects of IGF-1 treatment on CKS1BshRNA-induced myeloma cell death and growth inhibition
were evaluated. As shown in Figure 4E & 4F, IGF-1 treatment partially abrogated growth inhibition and cell death
induced by CKS1B-knockdown (p <0 .05).
STAT3 regulates the expression of many target genes
involved in cell survival and growth. To investigate whether
CKS1B activates STAT3 signaling through regulation of
STAT3 target genes, protein levels of cell growth and apoptosis related gene MCL1 were measured by western blot.

Activation of STAT3 is involved in CKS1B-mediated
myeloma cell growth and survival.
A specific STAT3 inhibitor Nifuroxazide at the dose
of 10 nM for 48 hours was used to treat CKS1B-transfected OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells. Nifuroxazide treatment
decreased p-STAT3 in both EV- and CKS1B-transfected
myeloma cells compared with untreated controls by western blot (Figure 4A), and it did not alter the total protein
and phosphorylation of MEK/ERK1 (data not shown), confirming its specificity. Nifuroxazide-induced cell growth
and cell death were also evaluated in CKS1B-transfected
OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells. Cells were treated with 10 nM
Nifuroxazide for 48 hours, Nifuroxazide treatment induced
more inhibition of cell growth (Figure 4B) and more
increase in cell death (Figure 4C) in CKS1B-transfected
cells compared with EV-transfected cells, indicating that

Fig. 4. Activation of STAT3 is involved in CKS1B-mediated myeloma cell growth and survival. (A) 1x106 CKS1B- transfected
OCI-MY5 and XG-1 were treated with 10nM Nifuroxazide (Nif) for 48 hours, and cell lysates were prepared. Protein levels
of p-STAT3 and MCL1 were analyzed and showed decreased in Nif treated MM cells by Western blots. (B) Cell growth and
(C) cell survival were evaluated. MM cells treated with Nif showed clearly more cell growth inhibition (OCI-MY5: 2.18M vs.
1.04M, and XG-1: 2.07M vs. 0.90M) and more cell death (OCI-MY5: 60% vs. 27%, and XG1: 58% vs. 31) in CKS1B overexpressed cells. Untreated and EV cells with or without Nif treatment were used as controls. (D) Western blots showed IGF-1
increased p-STAT3 and MCL1 in CKS1B silenced MM cells. 1x106 OCI-MY5 and XG-1 after CKS1B-knockdown (CKS1B-sh)
were treated with 100 ng/mL IGF-1 for 72 hours and p-STAT3 and MCL1 protein levels were analyzed. Untreated CKS1B-sh
cells and SCR cells with or without IGF-1 treatment were used as controls. (E) Cell growth and (F) cell death were evaluated.
IGF-1 can partially rescue CKS1B knockout induced cell growth inhibition (KMS28PE: 1.74M vs. 2.88M, OCI-MY5: 2.40M
vs. 3.64M, and XG1: 2.60M vs. 3.86M) and apoptosis (KMS28PE: 36% vs. 56%, OCI-MY5: 43% vs. 61%, and XG1: 39% vs.
53%). Untreated cells and SCR cells with or without IGF-1 treatment were used as controls. Results were expressed as Mean
+ SD of three independent experiments (*p <0 .05).

[14]. The level of MCL1 was decreased in CKS1B silenced
MM cells and increased in CKS1B over-expressing MM
cells (Figure 3B & 3C); whereas MCL1 expression did not
show alteration in MM cells manipulated by inhibition of
SKP2 and over-expression of p27Kip1 (Figure 3D & 3E).
Furthermore, MCL1, following STAT3 expression pattern,
was significantly increased in IGF1 treated MM cells with
inhibited CKS1B expression by CKS1B-shRNA (Figure
4D). These data provide evidence that CKS1B regulates
STAT3 signaling and MCL1 transcription.

CKS1B-knockdown.
Our results indicate that BCL2 is a downstream target
of the CKS1B and MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, a specific BCL2 inhibitor (2,9-Dimethoxy-11,12dihydrodibenzo[c,g][1,2]-diazocine
5,6-dioxide
and
5,5’-Dimethoxy-2,2’-dinitrosobenzyl) at the dose of 10 nM
for 48 hours was used to treat CKS1B-transfected OCIMY5 and XG-1 cells. Treatment with this BCL2-inhibitor
resulted in significantly more cell growth inhibition (Figure
5G) and cell death (Figure 5H) in CKS1B-transfected
cells compared with EV-transfected cells, indicating that
myeloma cells with higher CKS1B-expression are more
sensitive to BCL2 inhibition than cells with lower CKS1Bexpression. We subsequently over-expressed BCL2 by
lentivirus-mediated BCL2 cDNA transfection in CKS1Bsilenced KMS28PE, OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells. Cells were
cultured for 4 days and western blots confirmed increased
p-BCL2 levels in BCL2 cDNA and CKS1B-shRNA doubly-transfected cells (Figure 5I). The effects of BCL2-transfection on CKS1B-shRNA induced myeloma cell growth
inhibition and death were evaluated. As shown in Figure 5J
& 5K, although BCL2-cDNA and CKS1B-shRNA doublytransfected cells clearly showed cell growth inhibition and
death compared with SCR-transfected control cells (p <0
.05), BCL2 transfection partially abrogated myeloma cell
growth inhibition and death induced by CKS1B-silencing
(Figure 5J & 5K, p < 0.05).

Activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is also
involved in CKS1B-mediated myeloma cell growth and
survival.
A specific MEK inhibitor U0126 was used to treat
CKS1B-transfected OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells for 48
hours at the dose of 10 μM. Cell lysates were prepared and
subjected to western analysis using antibodies recognizing p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 proteins. U0126 decreased
p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 in both EV- and CKS1B-transfected myeloma cells (Figure 5A). However, U0126 also
shown to decrease p-STAT3 indicating this compound is
not specific inhibitor of MEK/ERK.. Interestingly, U0126
treatment down-regulated BCL2 in myeloma cells (Figure
5A), suggesting that BCL2 represents a downstream target
of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. We also evaluated
U0126-induced cell growth and cell viability in CKS1Btransfected OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells. Cells were treated
with 10 μM U0126 for 48 hours, U0126-treatment induced
more cell growth inhibition (Figure 5B) and cell death
(Figure 5C) in CKS1B-transfected cells than those in EVtransfected cells (p < 0.05).
Since inhibitors of MEK/ERK signaling pathway
may induce some non-specific effects on myeloma cell
growth and survival, we constitutively activated the MEK/
ERK signaling pathway by lentivirus-vector-mediated
MEK1-cDNA transfection in CKS1B-silenced KMS28PE,
OCI-MY5 and XG1 cells. Western blots showed a larger
increase of p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 levels in MEK1cDNA and CKS1B-shRNA double-transfected cells compared with SCR- and CKS1B-transfected controls (Figure
5D). MEK1-transfection increased protein levels of
p-BCL2 in CKS1B-silenced cells (Figure 5D), indicating
that MEK1-transfection could overcome CKS1B-knockdown-mediated inhibition of BCL2 signaling pathway
[13]. Although MEK1-cDNA and CKS1B-shRNA doublytransfected cells clearly showed increased cell death and
growth inhibition compared with SCR-transfected control
cells (Figure 5E & 5F, p < 0.05), these double-transfected
cells exhibited significantly less cell death and growth inhibition than CKS1B-silenced myeloma cells (Figure 5E &
5F, p <0 .05), indicating that MEK1-transfection partially
abrogated cell death and growth inhibition induced by

Combination of STAT3 and MEK1 inhibitors induced
synergistic cytotoxicity on myeloma cells with high
CKS1B expression.
Since the STAT3 and MEK/ERK signaling pathways
were both involved in CKS1B-induced myeloma cell
growth and survival, a combined targeting of these signaling pathways might induce synergistic cytotoxicity in
myeloma cells. CKS1B-transfected OCI-MY5 cells were
treated with combination of STAT3 and MEK1 inhibitors (i.e. U0126 [10 μM] plus Nifuroxazide [10 nM]), or
combination of STAT3 and BCL2 inhibitors (i.e. U0126
[10 μM] plus BCL2 inhibitor [10 nM]) for 48 hours. EVtransfected cells treated with the same combinations were
used as controls. Untreated CKS1B- and EV-transfected
cells also served as controls. As shown in Figure 6A & 6B,
the combinations of the STAT3 with MEK1 and the STAT3
with BCL2 inhibitors induced significant less cell growth
(Figure 6A) and more cell death (Figure 6B) in CKS1Btransfected OCI-MY5 compared with EV-transfected control cells (p <0.01). CKS1B-transfected XG-1 cells were
also treated with the same combinations for 48 hours. Similar to the CKS1B-transfected OCI-MY5 cells, the combinations of the STAT3 with MEK1 and STAT3 with BCL2
inhibitors induced significant less cell growth (Figure 6C)
and more cell death (Figure 6D) in CKS1B-transfected

expression. 1x106 CKS1B- transfected OCI-MY5 and XG-1 were treated with 10nM U0126 for 48 hours,

treatment were used as controls, and β-actin was used as loading control. (B) Cell growth and (C) cell
death were evaluated. MM cells treated with U0126 showed clearly more cell growth inhibition (OCI-MY5:
2.84M vs. 2.01M, and XG1: 2.3M vs. 1.3M) and more cell death (OCI-MY5: 80% vs. 43%, and XG1: 77%
vs. 52%) in CKS1B over-expressed cells than in empty vector (EV)-transfected controls. (D) Western
blots showed p-BCL2 increased in MEK1 over-expressed MM cells. KMS28PE, OCI-MY5 and XG-1 were
doubly transfected with CKS1B-shRNA and MEK1-cDNA to knockdown CKS1B and constitutively activate the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in these cells. SCR and CKS1B-sh cells were used as controls,
and β-actin was used as loading control. (E) Cell growth and (F) cell death were evaluated in CKS1B-sh
and MEK1 doubly-transfected cells after 72 hours induction. Clearly, MEK1 overexpression can partially
rescue CKS1B-shRNA induced cell growth inhibition (KMS28PE: 1.74M vs. 3.10M, OCI-MY5: 2.10M vs.
3.63M, and XG1: 1.20M vs. 2.50M) and cell apoptosis (KMS28PE: 22% vs. 41%, OCI-MY5: 27% vs. 51%,
and XG1: 33% vs. 56%). (G) Cell growth and (H) cell death were evaluated in the treatment of a specific BCL2 inhibitor (BCL2-inh). OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells transfected with CKS1B showed a stronger cell
growth inhibition (OCi-MY5: 1.97M vs. 0.85M, and XG1: 1.53M vs. 0.96M) and cell death (OCI-MY5: 60%
vs. 17%, and XG1: 58% vs. 21%) compared with EV- transfected OCI-MY5 and XG-1. (I) Western blots

ings clarify the SKP2/ p27Kip1-independent mechanisms of
CKS1B activity in maintaining myeloma cell growth and
survival, and also provide a rationale for specifically targeting STAT3 and MEK/ERK/BCL2 in aggressive CKS1Boverexpressing MM.
CKS1B is one of the 70 high-risk signature genes associated with poor outcome in newly diagnosed myeloma
[3]. Elevated expression of CKS1B is a predictor of poor
prognosis and aggressive disease in many other malignancies [15-18]. Recently, Westbrook et al reported that
Cks1 mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated in
transgenic mice with mammary tumors initiated by erbB2,
c-myc and polyoma middle-T (PyMT) [19]. Consistent
with our current report, mammary tumor cells derived from
both transgenic mice and cell lines with high expression of
Cks1 failed to reveal a decrease of p27Kip1; in fact p27Kip1
levels were slightly higher in mammary tumors initiated
by erbB2, PyMT and MNU [19]. We previously showed
that CKS1B is essential for myeloma cell growth and survival by using gene knockdown [4]. In the present study,
forced expression of CKS1B was found to promote multidrug-resistance. Based on our results, it is reasonable to
speculate that high CKS1B expression will also result in
increased drug resistance in other malignancies.
We have reported that dysregulation of expression of
one of the three type D cyclins is likely to be an initiating
genetic lesion in most myelomas and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) [20, 21]. Dysregulation of type D cyclins is a common event in cancer
that contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting hyper-phosphorylation of pRB1 and activation of E2F target genes,
which are important in promoting the transition of cells
through early G1-phase to S-phase [22-24]. RNA interference of CKS1B mRNA in myeloma cells led to reduced
CKS1B mRNA and protein, an accumulation of p27Kip1,
and profound growth inhibition [4]. Based on these observations, we conclude that while activation of a type D
cyclin is an early initiating event, CKS1B over-expression
is a progression event; both events are required for the loss
of early and late G1- to S-phase cell cycle checkpoints and
to establish an aggressive clinical phenotype. Recent studies indicate that Cks1 is required not only for G1/S, but also
for G2/M transition [25-27]. Knockdown of Cks1 in mouse
embryonic fibroblasts or Hela cells results in cell cycle
arrest in G2 and blocks cell proliferation. Over-expression
of cyclin B1 rescues this cell cycle arrest [27]. Thus, these
observations further demonstrate that CKS1B functions
indeed at multiple levels.
In this study, we found that CKS1B-knockdown inhibited and CKS1B-overexpression activated STAT3 and
MEK/ERK signaling pathways, demonstrating that STAT3
and MEK/ERK signaling pathways are the CKS1B downstream signaling pathways, independent of SKP2/p27Kip1.
Further investigation showed that BCL2 is also a downstream target of MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Our results

XG-1 cells compared with EV-transfected control cells
(p < 0.01). Combination Indices (CI) were also calculated
according to the method that was developed by Chou and
Talalay [14] . The CI values of EV- and CKS1B-transfected OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells treated with combination
of STAT3 and MEK1 inhibitors are 0.44 and 0.30, and 0.69
and 0.27, respectively; while these cells treated with combination of STAT3 and BCL2 inhibitors are 0.37 and 0.27,
and 0.50 and 0.26, respectively. The lower CI values were
shown in the CKS1B-transfected cells, which means the
synergism of the combinations are stronger in the CKS1Btransfected cells compared with the EV-transfected cells.
Our results demonstrated that these combinations exhibit
synergistic effect and are very toxic to myeloma cells even
when they do not over-express CKS1B, but myeloma cells
with higher CKS1B-expression are more sensitive to combinations therapy with STAT3 and MEK/ERK inhibitors
than cells with lower CKS1B-expression.

DISCUSSION
Expression of CKS1B, which maps to a previously
defined amplicon at 1q21 and regulates SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitination and proteolysis of the CDK inhibitor
p27Kip1, was significantly overexpressed in newly diagnosed myeloma patients with a short survival [3, 4]. In this
study, we showed that high expression of CKS1B does also
predict post-relapse survival. Our study showed a marked
increase of CKS1B expression in relapsed MMs, which
provides molecular evidence of a more drug-resistant disease.
The aim of the present study was to further clarify the
functional role of CKS1B in myeloma cell survival and
drug-resistance by investigating CKS1B-induced SKP2and p27Kip1-independent signaling pathways. Our results
show that forced-expression of CKS1B in MM cells
induces multidrug-resistance, providing direct evidence for
the crucial role of CKS1B in myeloma progression. Using
western blots, we found that over-expression of CKS1B
stimulates STAT3 and MEK/ERK, whereas SKP2 knockdown or p27Kip1 over-expression activated rather than suppressed STAT3 and MEK/ERK pathways, suggesting that
SKP2 over-expression or p27Kip1 inhibition exerted the
opposite effect of CKS1B over-expression on STAT3 and
MEK/ERK. We also showed that BCL2 is a downstream
target of CKS1B- induced MEK/ERK signaling. Moreover,
stimulation of STAT3 and MEK/ERK/BCL2 signaling
pathways partially abrogated MM cell death and growth
inhibition induced by CKS1B-knockdown.
Targeting STAT3 and MEK/ERK/BCL2 activity by
specific inhibitors resulted in significant MM cell death
and growth inhibition and their combinations had a synergistic cytotoxic effect on myeloma cells. Thus, our findwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/

are consistent with the recent investigations which showed
that CKS1B stimulated MEK/ERK signaling pathway in
the breast cancer cells [28, 29]. Our findings explain why
SKP2 knockdown or p27Kip1 over-expression induces less
myeloma cell growth inhibition and cell death than CKS1B
knockdown [4]. Myeloma cells with forced CKS1B expression are more sensitive to treatment with specific inhibitors targeting these signaling pathways, while stimulation
of these signaling pathways partially abrogates myeloma
cell death and growth inhibition, induced by CKS1B
knockdown. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that CKS1B
mediates myeloma cell growth and drug-resistance through
activation of STAT3 and MEK/ERK/BCL2 signaling pathways.
In conclusion, this study further demonstrates that
CKS1B plays a crucial role in MM cell growth and survival and for the first time provides direct evidence for the
crucial role of CKS1B in myeloma multidrug-resistance.
We identified STAT3 and MEK/ERK/BCL2 as CKS1Bdownstream signaling pathways; and thereby provided tarOncoTarget, May 2010

gets for the development of new therapeutic approaches for
CKS1B over-expressing myeloma and other tumor malignancies. Since CKS1B over-expression and 1q21 gains
have been observed in many other malignancies and it is
well-documented that JAK/STAT3 and MEK/ERK/BCL2
signaling pathways play a crucial role in tumor cell survival, drug-resistance and cancer progression [30-38], our
findings might have broad applications for cancer treatment. Further preclinical in-vivo animal studies are needed
to confirm our in-vitro findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects and gene Expression Profiling (GEP)
51 paired myeloma samples collected at baseline and
at early relapse were obtained from newly diagnosed MM
patients who were treated on the National Institutes of
Health-sponsored clinical trials UARK 98-026 (Total Ther30

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/

apy 2 [TT2], n = 668) [39, 40] . This protocol used induction
regimens followed by melphalan-based tandem autotransplantation, consolidation chemotherapy, and maintenance
treatment. All subjects provided written informed consent,
acknowledging the investigational nature of the protocol
and the availability of other treatment options, as required
by the Institutional Review Board and the Food and Drug
Administration and in line with the Helsinki Declaration.
The plasma cells were isolated by automated CD138
immunomagnetic bead selection (Miltenyi Biotec). CD38/
CD45 flow cytometry determined that plasma cell purity
was routinely 85% or greater [41, 42]. 51 myeloma patients
with paired GEPs from U133 Plus2 Affymetrix microarray
at baseline and at relapse were used in this study. All GEP
data included in the study were reported in our previous
publications [29, 42, 43] . Paired Student t test were used to
compare CKS1B expression between baseline and relapse
samples. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
post-relapse survival.

following a standard protocol [44]. Briefly, crude virus
was concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 9 000 g for 90
minutes. Viral titers were determined by measuring the
amount of HIV-1 p24 antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NEN Life Sciences, Boston, MA). A 99%
transduction efficiency of MM cells was achieved with
3000 ng lentiviral p24 particles/106 cells. Myeloma cells
with CKS1B-knockdown, SKP2-knockdown or p27Kip1
over-expression were described previously [4]. Primers for
cDNA clones (CKS1B forward, 5'-CGA TCA TGT CGC
ACA AAC A-3’, and reverse, 5'-GCC AGC TTC ATT TCT
TTG GT-3’; MEK1 forward,5’- GTC CAA AAT GCC CAA
GAA GA-3’, and reverse, 5’-CAA ACA CTT AGA CGC
CAG CA-3’; and BCL2 forward, 5’-GTC CAA GAA TGC
AAA GCA CA-3’, and reverse, 5’-AGC CTG CTT TGT
TTC AT-3’) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA). Recombinant lentiviruses were produced by transient
transfection of 293T cells following a standard protocol
[44]. Efficiency of viral transfection was determined by
counting the number of GFP expressing cells using flow
cytometry and the transduction efficiency of MM cells was
above 95%.

Human myeloma cell lines and reagents
Myeloma cell lines KMS28PE,OCI-MY5, and XG1
were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 5%
CO2.
Bortezomib was obtained from Millennium Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA). Doxorubicin and etoposide
were purchased from Sigma (Louis, MO). The MEK
inhibitor U0126 was obtained from Promega (Madison,
WI); the STAT3 inhibitor Nifuroxazide was purchased
from Sigma and the Bcl2 inhibitor (2,9-Dimethoxy11,12-dihydrodibenzo[c,g][1,2]-diazocine 5,6-dioxide and
5,5’-Dimethoxy-2,2’-dinitrosobenzyl) was purchased from
Emd biosciences (San Diego, CA). The BCL2 inhibitor
is not a specific compound to target BCL2, it inhibits the
activity of both BCL2 and BCL-xl. These inhibitors were
dissolved in DMSO (Sigma), and the final concentration of
DMSO in cultures was 0.05%. IGF-1 was obtained from
R&D (Minneapolis, MN).

Treatment of CKS1B-overexpressing MM cells with
chemotherapeutic drugs
To determine the role of CKS1B in MM drug-resistance, OCI-MY5 and XG-1 cells were transfected with
CKS1B-cDNA to overexpress CKS1B in these cell lines
by lentivirus expression vector system. 1×106 cells were
treated with bortezomib at 5 nM for 48 hours in the cultures. Cell growth was evaluated by cell counting with a
hemocytometer, and dead cells were determined by trypan
blue staining, from which dead-cell fraction was calculated. Untreated cells and empty-vector (EV) transfected
cells with or without drug-treatment were used as controls.
Similar experiments were performed for doxorubicin (100
nM) and etoposide (100 nM), and cells were treated for 48
hours.
Western Blots
Western blots were performed to examine the protein
levels in MM cells as previously described [45, 46]. CKS1B
antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA)
and all other primary antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). β-actin was used to
normalize the amount of protein in each sample.

Specific gene silencing or overexpressing by lentivirus
expression vector system
The lentiviral system in this study was kindly gifted
from Dr. Didier Trono (National Center for Competence in
Research, Switzerland). This system includes the lentiviral
vector pLVTH, the envelop plasmid pMD2G, and the packaging plasmid pCMV-dR8.74. Specific gene knockdown
was previously described [4, 29]. Similar methods are used
for gene over-expression by this system. Recombinant lentivirus was produced by transient transfection of 293T cells
