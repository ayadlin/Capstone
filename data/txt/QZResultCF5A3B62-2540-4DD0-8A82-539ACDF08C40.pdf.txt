ABSTRACT
Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2 (EphA2) is upregulated in
gastric cancer tissues and cells, which is accompanied by epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT). The current study was designed to establish the oxaliplatin-resistant
human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901/L-OHP, to determine if EMT in these cells
could be reversed, and to determine if the susceptibility of these cells to oxaliplatin
was affected by silencing EphA2 expression. We found that EphA2 expression levels
were upregulated in gastric cancer and associated with chemotherapy sensitivity.
EphA2 and the EMT molecular markers N-cadherin and Snail were upregulated in
SGC-7901/L-OHP cells, while silencing of EphA2 using small interfering RNA had the
opposite effect. Moreover, silencing of EphA2 inhibited cell migration and invasion,
and significantly enhanced the sensitivity of oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells
to oxaliplatin. These observations demonstrate that EphA2 affects the sensitivity to
oxaliplatin by inducing EMT in oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells.

rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer has not
significantly increased [11-13].
The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)
refers to the physiopathological process in which
epithelial cell-like features are lost and mesenchymal
cell-like features gradually develop in tumor cells
originating from epithelia. EMT plays important roles
in tumor invasion and metastasis, acquisition and
maintenance of stem cell characteristics, resistance to
cell death and aging, escape from immune monitoring,
and drug resistance of tumor cells [14]. It is believed
by many to be an early critical event in the induction
of tumor invasion and metastasis. Indeed, recent studies
have indicated that the occurrence of EMT in tumor cells
is closely related to drug resistance [15].
The increased expression and activity of
erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular carcinoma
(Eph) receptors are observed in multiple tumors and are
closely related to tumor metastasis and the prognosis of
patients with malignancies [16]. EphA2 is a member of
the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family and was the first

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer remains the third leading cause of
cancer-related mortality worldwide; however, its incidence
has decreased in the past six decades [1,2]. Most patients
are diagnosed with this disease at an advanced stage and
the 5-year survival rate for surgically resected cases ranges
from 13.1% to 43.8% [3]. The incidence and mortality of
gastric cancer rank second and third, respectively, among
malignant tumor types in China [4]. Chemotherapy
plays a decisive role in the prevention and treatment of
gastric cancer recurrence and metastasis [5,6]. Oxaliplatin
(L-OHP) belongs to the third generation of platinum
compounds and is gradually becoming the primary
drug for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer [7].
Although chemotherapeutic regimens for gastric cancer
are continuously improving, adverse treatment effects
following gastric cancer chemotherapy still occur in
some patients. In addition, resistance to chemotherapeutic
drugs occurs or develops in most tumor cells, leading to
treatment failure [8-10]. Consequently, the 5-year survival

protein shown to demonstrate tyrosine kinase activity among
the Eph proteins encoded for by genes on chromosome
lp36.1 [17]. Our previous studies demonstrated that EphA2
plays a key role in signal transduction pathways associated
with the regulation of growth, proliferation, and metastasis of
tumor cells. Conversely, silencing of EphA2 resulted in the
inhibition of human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cell invasion
both in vitro and in vivo [18]. However, previous studies
have not determined if the EMT in oxaliplatin-resistant
gastric cancer cells can be regulated by EphA2, thereby
affecting associated drug resistance. The putative role of
EphA2 in this phenomenon and the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear and require further investigation.
In this study, the expression of EphA2 in cancer
tissues and adjacent normal gastric mucosa was determined
by immunohistochemistry in 120 patients with advanced
gastric cancer. The chemotherapy response rate of all
patients was used to analyze the association between EphA2
expression and chemosensitivity. We also used in vitro
assays to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of oxaliplatin. The
sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to oxaliplatin following
silencing of EphA2 was determined using the oxaliplatinresistant gastric cancer cell line, SGC-7901/L-OHP. The
expression of EphA2 and the EMT markers, N-cadherin,
Snail, and E-cadherin, were also analyzed in vitro by
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR),

Western blotting, and immunoﬂuorescence analyses of the
SGC-7901/L-OHP cells. In addition, cell migration and cell
invasion were also studied.

RESULTS
EphA2 expression is associated with the
therapeutic effects of oxaliplatin-based
chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric
cancer
The expression of EphA2 in cancer tissues
and adjacent normal gastric mucosa was analyzed
in 120 patients with advanced gastric cancer using
immunohistochemistry. Patients were treated with a 2 h
continuous infusion of oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2) on day 1.
The patients were also administered calcium folinate (400
mg/m2) followed by fluorouracil(5-FU, 400 mg/m2) for 46
h by continuous infusion of 2400 mg/m2 on days 1 and
2. Treatment was repeated every 2 weeks. After three of
these treatment regimens, the chemotherapy response rate
of all patients was analyzed to investigate the association
between EphA2 expression and chemosensitivity. EphA2
showed significantly higher expression in gastric cancer
tissues relative to adjacent normal gastric mucosa
(Figure 1). As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the expression

higher than that in adjacent normal gastric mucosa tissues
(P < 0.05). All 120 patients with advanced gastric cancer
received three cycles of FOLFOX6 chemotherapy, and the
efficacy evaluation revealed complete remission (CR) in
10 cases, partial remission (PR) in 52 cases, stable disease
(SD) in 41 cases, and progressive disease (PD) in 17 cases.
The chemotherapy response rate (RR) was 51.67%. The
RR was 78.72% and 34.24% in the EphA2-negative and
Eph-A2-positive expression groups, respectively. The
chemotherapy RR in the EphA2-negative expression group
was higher than that in the EphA2-positive group, with
a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) (Table 3).

7901/L-OHP under an inverted phase contrast microscope
showed that the epithelial mucosa in the SGC-7901 cells was
uniformly circular. On the other hand, a mesenchymal-like
phenotype was observed for SGC-7901/L-OHP cells, which
displayed irregular shapes such as long strip, fusiform, and
polygon. The resultant morphological changes indicated
that SGC-7901/L-OHP cells possessed a mesenchymal-like
phenotype (Figure 2A–2D). A cell growth curve analysis
revealed that compared with the gastric cancer cell line
SGC-7901, the proliferation rate of the oxaliplatin-resistant
gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901/L-OHP was significantly
reduced (Figure 2E). The population doubling time of the
SGC-7901/L-OHP cells was 27.44 ± 2.01 h, whereas that of
the SGC-7901 cells was 23.89 ± 1.56 h, with a statistically
significant difference (P < 0.05). These results suggest that
the oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901/LOHP exhibited reduced proliferative capacity. The resistance
level of SGC-7901/L-OHP cells to L-OHP was determined
using the MTT (3- (4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) assay. The results indicated that the

inhibition ratio of L-OHP to SGC-7901 gradually increased,
whereas the inhibition ratio of L-OHP to SGC-7901/L-OHP
was significantly lower at an identical concentration of
L-OPH (P<0.05) (Figure 2F). The IC50 values within 48 h
of treatment of SGC-7901/L-OHP and SGC-7901 cells were
calculated as 97.90 and 10.10 µg/mL, respectively, following
probit regression analysis. The resistance index (RI) of SGC7901/L-OHP cells to L-OHP was calculated to be 9.7 using
the following formula: RI = IC50 (drug resistance cells)/IC50
(parental cells). These results suggest that there is increased
resistance of oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells to
L-OHP.

Expression of EphA2 in SGC-7901 and SGC7901/L-OHP cells
The mRNA and protein expression of EphA2 in
SGC-7901 and SGC-7901/L-OHP cells was analyzed
by real-time qPCR and Western blotting, respectively.

in SGC-7901 was set to 1. The results indicated that the
relative expression of EphA2 mRNA and protein in SGC7901/L-OHP cells was significantly increased compared to

that in SGC-7901 cells. At 48 h post-transfection of
SGC-7901/L-OHP cells with EphA2 siRNA, the mRNA
and protein expression levels of EphA2 were evaluated
by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting,
respectively. Compared with the control cells, the mRNA
and protein levels of EphA2 in the EphA2 knockdown
cells significantly decreased (P < 0.05) (Figure 4C–4E).

Effects of EphA2 knockdown on oxaliplatinresistant gastric cancer cells
The oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cell line
SGC-7901/L-OHP was transfected with EphA2 siRNA
using Lipofectamine 2000. Insignificant morphological
changes of these cells before and after transfection were
observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope, and
the transfection efficiency was > 80% (Figure 4A and 4B);
this efficiency was suitable to analyze the effects of
siRNA. The mRNA and protein expression of EphA2
in SGC-7901/L-OHP cells was significantly higher than

It is well known that E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and

for 48 h, the mRNA and protein expression of N-cadherin
and Snail was examined by quantitative real-time PCR and
Western blotting, respectively. The results demonstrated

that the expression levels of N-cadherin mRNA and
protein were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the
EphA2 knockdown cells compared with the negative
control and blank control cells (P < 0.05). Conversely,
the expression levels of N-cadherin and Snail mRNA
and protein were reduced in the EphA2 knockdown cells
compared with the negative control and blank control
cells (P < 0.05) (Figure 5A–5C). These results suggest
that expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, in
SGC-7901/L-OHP cells was upregulated at the mRNA and
protein levels, whereas expression of the mesenchymal
marker, N-cadherin, and the transcription factor, Snail,
was inhibited in SGC-7901/L-OHP cells following
transfection with EphA2 siRNA. Similar results were
obtained by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 5D).
Morphological characteristics of the EMT include the
loss of epithelial characteristics and the acquisition of
mesenchymal properties such as spindle-like fusiform
shape and loss of sheet-like architecture in epithelial cells.

After transfection of SGC-7901/L-OHP cells with EphA2
siRNA, an epithelioid phenotype was visualized under
an inverted phase contrast microscope. Conversely, the
control and blank groups still exhibited a mesenchymallike phenotype (Figure 5E). These results suggest that
EphA2 is a driving force of EMT in SGC-7901/L-OHP
cells, and silencing its expression might reverse the EMT
process.

Changes in migration and invasion ability in
oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells after
transfection with EphA2 siRNA
To demonstrate the effects of EphA2 on the migration
and invasion of gastric cancer cells, a scratch woundhealing assay was used to validate our observations that
EphA2 expression has a positive effect on cell migration
ability. As shown in Figure 6A and 6B, the EphA2-silenced
oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells (SGC-7901/L-OHP)

migrated at a significantly reduced rate compared with the
control group (P < 0.05). A cell invasion assay based on the
Boyden chamber assay was used to provide further support
for the EphA2-mediated effect on cell invasion. Images of
cells that migrated through the Matrigel matrix are shown
in Figure 6C and 6D. Upon inhibition of endogenous
EphA2, the number of SGC-7901/L-OHP oxaliplatinresistant gastric cancer cells migrating through the Matrigel
significantly decreased compared with the control group
(P < 0.05). These results suggest that EphA2 facilitates the

migration and invasion of SGC-7901/L-OHP oxaliplatinresistant gastric cancer cells.

cancer cells to L-OHP after transfection with

rates of L-OHP in each cell group increased concomitantly
with an increase in L-OHP concentration. The inhibition
rate of L-OHP (identical concentrations) in the EphA2
knockdown cells was significantly higher than that in
control siRNA and blank cells (P < 0.05). These results
suggest that EphA2 silencing enhances the susceptibility
of SGC-7901/L-OHP cells to L-OHP (Figure 7)

morphologies with long horns stretching out from the
edges of cells. The intercellular junctions of the resistant
cells were relatively loose, indicating that the morphology
of the oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/L-OHP was consistent with the characteristics of
EMT. The drug RI of SGC-7901/L-OHP to L-OHP was
9.7 in this study. Snow [19] reported that a drug RI < 5 is
indicative of low-level drug resistance, a drug RI between
5 and 15 suggests moderate-level drug resistance, and
a drug RI > 15 suggests high-level drug resistance. In
accordance with this proposed standard, the drug RI of
SGC-7901/L-OHP to L-OHP represents moderate drug
resistance, suggesting that the SGC-7901/L-OHP cell line
is a reliable model of drug resistance and an ideal model
for studying the mechanisms underlying drug resistance
and screening for reversing agents.
The EMT is not only an early critical event involved
in the induction of tumor invasion and metastasis, but is
also closely related to drug resistance in tumor cells [20].
Recently, Yao [21] demonstrated that the characteristics
involved in promoting distant metastasis and drug
resistance in tumor cells following chemotherapy were
exhibited during the process of EMT development. A
series of recent studies regarding the effects of EMT on

DISCUSSION
In this study, we revealed that EphA2 was
overexpressed in gastric cancer patients who received
chemotherapy. Furthermore, reduced EphA2 expression
affected the efficacy of chemotherapy. As part of this
study, the oxaliplatin-resistant human gastric cancer cell
line SGC-7901/L-OHP was successfully established
by induction of a continuous stepwise increase in drug
concentration. This long-term exposure of the human
gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 to oxaliplatin was
performed for 6 months by gradually increasing the
drug dose, resulting in relatively stable drug resistance.
Compared with the parental cells (SGC-7901), the
drug-resistant cells exhibited long strip and fusiform

the occurrence of drug resistance in tumors demonstrated
that the susceptibility of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs was also significantly altered. However, in the
same studies, the mesenchymal phenotype in epitheliumderived tumor cells occurred as a consequence of EMT,
and mesenchymal changes in cell morphology were
observed during the generation of multiple drug-resistant
cell lines [22-24]. Thomson [25] found that the expression
of E-cadherin in tumor tissues was extremely low after
the erlotinib-resistant A549 cell line was used to inoculate
nude mice. Yang [26] observed that morphological changes
were present in oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer
cells, and loss of polarity, disappearance of intercellular
junctions, presence of pseudopodia, and changes in
the expression of the epithelial and mesenchymal cell
markers, E-cadherin and vimentin, were also observed.
In this study, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting
and immunfluorescence analyses revealed that the EMT
molecular markers, N-cadherin and Snail, were increased
while E-cadherin was decreased in oxaliplatin-resistant
gastric cancer cells. Further analyses revealed that the
opposite effects were observed following the silencing of
EphA2.
Ephs form the largest known subfamily of RTK
families and the Eph proteins are involved in the
transduction of multiple signal pathways and the regulation
of immune function in different tissues and cells. Thus,
Eph is closely related to the development and progression
of tumors [27]. EphA2, a member of the RTK family,
transduces extracellular signals into the cell that modulate

downstream signaling networks. EphA2 upregulation is a
common event in gastric cancer specimens and is closely
correlated with cancer metastasis and the promotion
of EMT in gastric cancer cells through activation of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling [28]. Research has shown that
overexpression of EphA2 in breast cancer cells promotes
resistance to trastuzumab, a human monoclonal anti-HER2
antibody used for breast cancer treatment [29]. Blocking
the activation of EphA2 not only prevents tumors from
progressing but also increases the susceptibility of tumor
cells to chemotherapy [24]. A separate study suggested that
silencing EphA2 enhanced the sensitivity of lung tumors
and malignant plural mesothelioma cells to Lipoplatin™
treatment [30]. Therefore, EphA2 has been suggested as a
novel target for cancer treatment [31-33]. In this study, we
observed that EphA2 expression significantly correlated
with the expression of EMT markers in the oxaliplatinresistant gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901/L-OHP. The
suppression of EphA2 expression resulted in the inhibition
of cell migration and invasion, and prevention of EMT
in these cells. Thus, inhibition of EphA2 enhances the
susceptibility of SGC-7901/L-OHP cells to L-OHP. The
aforementioned results further validate that the reversal of
oxaliplatin resistance in SGC-7901/L-OHP cells following
the silencing of EphA2 results in the prevention of EMT.
In conclusion, this study reports that EphA2
functions as an EMT promoter, and that the EMT process
in SGC-7901/L-OHP cells can be inhibited by EphA2
siRNA. Conversely, the susceptibility of SGC-7901/LOHP cells to L-OHP increases concomitantly with the

occurrence of EMT. These findings indicate that EphA2
promotes EMT in SGC-7901/L-OHP cell, and silencing
its expression increases the susceptibility of SGC-7901/LOHP cells to L-OHP via the EMT. Therefore, EphA2 is
an excellent candidate for the development of a targeted
gastric cancer therapy that will improve chemosensitivity
in tumors while maintaining resistance in normal cells.

to each well and the contents of the wells were mixed
for an additional 10 min. Spectrometric absorbance was
determined at a wavelength of 490 nm using a microplate

were measured for each sample.

Plasmid construction and transfection

MATERIALS AND METHODS

As previously described, the EphA2 coding
sequence and EphA2 siRNA were constructed by Jikai
Biomedical (Shanghai, China). A blank vector was used
as a negative control [18]. A total of 5 × 105 SGC-7901/LOHP cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate.
The SGC-7901/-LOHP cells were transfected upon
reaching 80–90% confluence. Three groups of SGC-7901/LOHP cells used in this study including untransfected
cells (‘Blank Ctrl’), cells transfected with the EphA2siRNA vector (‘EphA2 Si’) and cells transfected with the
scrambled shRNA vector (‘Si Ctrl’). In the latter stages of
the study, the three groups of cells were assayed to test the
influence of EphA2 on EMT.

Materials
Anti-EphA2, Snail, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin
antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Oxaliplatin was purchased from
Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceutical (Paris, France).

Patient selection and tissue preparation
Between January 2013 and December 2016, 120
patients (including 88 male and 32 female subjects)
between 28 and 76 years of age (59.2 ± 12.6 years) with
gastric adenocarcinoma from the Department of General
Surgery in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University
(Changsha, China) were selected for this study (reference
Table 2 for patient clinicopathologic features). Radical
resection was performed on each of these patients. The
patients received chemotherapy, but no radiotherapy prior
to surgery. The study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University.
Cancer tissues were excised, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin, and embedded in paraffin blocks.

Immunohistochemistry
The paraffin-embedded sections (4 mm thick)
were cut and then deparaffinized and rehydrated.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect
the expression of EphA2 by using the DAKO EnVision
System (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Following proteolytic
digestion, the slides were blocked with peroxidase for 30
min at room temperature with 2.5% hydrogen peroxide
in methanol. The slides were subsequently incubated
overnight with primary antibody at 4°C. After washing,
the slices were incubated with peroxidase-labeled
polymer and substrate-chromogen. Finally, sections were
incubated for 5 min at room temperature in phosphatebuffered solution containing diaminobenzidine. The
staining results of the targeted proteins were observed
under the microscope. Negative controls were prepared
by substituting the primary antibody with non-immune
rabbit serum. Two independent pathologists evaluated and
scored the sections following observation of 10 random
visual fields for each section (double-blinded). The
evaluation of the staining was graded semi-quantitatively.
The expression intensity scores (0 point = 0–5%; 1 point
= 6–25%; 2 points = 26–50%; 3 points = more than 50%)
and positive staining cell scores (1 point = weak intensity;
2 points = moderate intensity; 3 points = strong intensity)
were summed. Sum scores ≥ 3 points were considered
significant overexpression and noted as positive to
simplify the data analysis.

Evaluation of chemotherapy efficacy
According to the World Health Organization criteria
for the determination of the efficacy of multiple organ
tumors the subjects were divided into CR, PR, SD and PD
groups. The total RR refers to CR% + PR%.

Cell culture
The human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SGC7901 was obtained from the Xiangya Central Experiment
Laboratory, Central South University (Changsha, China).
The cells were cultured in PRMI 1640 (Hyclone, Waltham,
MA, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Hyclone) in a humidified atmosphere of 37°C at
5% CO2.

MTT assay
SGC-7901/-LOHP cells were incubated in 96-well
plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well for 24 h. Then,
after the specified time points, 10 mL MTT dye (5 mg/
mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added, and
the SGC-7901/-LOHP cells were incubated for another 4

wounding under the inverted microscope.

calculated from the standard curve as directed. All of the
reported results are the average ratios of three different
independent experiments.

Cell invasion assay

The cells were grown to confluence and lysed in
lysis buffer Equal amounts of protein were loaded and
resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE ( Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA) Whole-cell extracts were
prepared using 0.14 M NaCl, 0.2 M triethanolamine,
0.2% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40
supplemented with a protease inhibitor (Sigma). A total
of 40 μg protein was loaded into each well. Proteins
were electrotransferred onto membranes that were
subsequently blocked and incubated overnight at 4°C
with primary antibody. Next, the membranes were
incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. Then, the
bands were visualized and quantitated using the ECL
Advance Detection System (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ, USA).

Western blotting

Transwell invasion assays were performed in 24well 8 mm pore size transwell plates according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Corning, New York, USA).
The bottom of each transwell chamber was coated with BD
Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA, USA). The upper chamber was filled with
1 × 105 cells in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine
serum, and the lower chamber was filled with RPMI
1640 containing 25% fetal bovine serum (this served as
a chemoattractant). After the chambers were incubated
for 24 h or 48 h at 37°C, non-invading cells on the upper
side of the chamber were removed from the surface of
the membrane by scrubbing, and invading cells on the
lower surface of the membrane were fixed in methanol,
mounted, and dried. The number of cells invading through
the matrigel was counted by a technician blinded to the
experimental settings. The cells were counted in four
randomly selected microscopic fields for each filter. The
test was repeated three times.

Statistical analysis
The protein expression levels were compared with
χ2 tests. Continuous variables were evaluated using the
unpaired Student’s t-test. Bivariate correlations between
study variables were calculated by Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficients. Measurement data were expressed
as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses
were performed with SPSS 19.0 software. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Immunfluorescence
SGC-7901/L-OHP cells were grown in dishes
and fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The
SGC-7901/L-OHP cells were permeabilized with
0.04% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The primary antibody,
diluted in phosphate-buffered solution/5% bovine
serum albumin, was applied for 1 h at 37°C. Following
phosphate-buffered solution washing steps, the
appropriate Alexa Fluor 488-linked secondary antibody
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was applied for 30 min
at room temperature. Controls were performed omitting
the primary antibody and with the corresponding
immunoglobulin G fraction as the primary antibody.
SGC-7901/L-OHP cells were counterstained with SGC7901/L-OHP cells were coun, and images were viewed
under a fluorescence microscope.
