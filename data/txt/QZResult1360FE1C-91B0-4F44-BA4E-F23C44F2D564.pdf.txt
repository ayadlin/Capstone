Abstract
The p53 tumor suppressor plays a key role in protection
against malignant transformation. MDM2 and MDMX are
important regulators of the transcriptional activity and
stability of p53 by binding to its NH2 terminus. Recent studies
suggest that inhibition of both MDM2 and MDMX is necessary
for robust activation of p53 in certain tumor cells. However,
small-molecule MDM2 inhibitors such as Nutlin fail to inhibit
MDMX despite significant homology between the two proteins.
The therapeutic efficacy of such compounds may be compromised by MDMX overexpression. To evaluate the feasibility
and biological effects of simultaneously disrupting p53
binding to MDM2 and MDMX, we used phage display to
identify a novel peptide that can inhibit p53 interactions with
MDM2 (IC50 = 10 nmol/L) and MDMX (IC50 = 100 nmol/L).
Expression of a scaffold protein (thioredoxin) displaying this
peptide sequence by adenovirus disrupts both MDM2 and
MDMX interaction with p53, resulting in efficient p53
activation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of tumor cells
overexpressing MDM2 and MDMX. Intratumoral injection of
the adenovirus also induces growth suppression of tumor
xenografts in mice in a p53-dependent fashion. These results
show the therapeutic potential of targeting both MDM2 and
MDMX in cancer, and provide a novel structural motif for the
design of potent p53 activators. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8810–7]

Introduction
MDM2 is a ubiquitin E3 ligase for p53 and an important
regulator of p53 stability and activity by forming a negative
feedback loop (1, 2). Overexpression of MDM2 abrogates the ability
of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (3). In f30% of
human osteogenic sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas, MDM2 is
overexpressed due to gene amplification. In tumors without MDM2
amplification, hyperactivation of MDM2 due to silencing of ARF
expression also leads to p53 inactivation. Therefore, MDM2 is a
key factor in tolerance of wild-type p53 in nearly 50% of tumors,
making it an attractive target for the development of novel
antitumor agents (4).
The MDM2 homologue MDMX also binds to p53 and inhibits
p53-dependent transcription (5). Loss of MDM2 or MDMX leads to
embryonic lethality, which can be rescued by deletion of p53 (6–8).
Therefore, expression of both MDM2 and MDMX is necessary for
regulation of p53 during development. Unlike MDM2, MDMX does
not have significant intrinsic E3 ligase activity (9). However, MDMX
forms heterodimers with MDM2 through COOH-terminal RING

domain interactions, which stimulates the ability of MDM2 to
ubiquitinate and degrade p53 (10–13). Another consequence of
MDMX-MDM2 heterodimer formation is that MDMX can be
ubiquitinated and degraded by MDM2 (14–16); this is an important
mechanism for controlling MDMX level during p53 stress response.
Recent studies suggest that the major mechanism of p53
regulation by MDMX is the formation of inactive MDMX-p53
complexes. Under nonstress conditions, MDM2 and p53 have short
half-lives whereas MDMX is relatively stable. Therefore, elimination
of MDMX is important for efficient p53 activation during stress
response. DNA damage induces MDMX phosphorylation by ATM
and Chk2 at several COOH-terminal serine residues (Ser342, Ser367,
and Ser403) generating a docking site for 14-3-3. These modifications stimulate MDMX degradation by MDM2, which facilitates p53
activation (17–20). Ribosomal stress resulting from disruption of
rRNA biogenesis also activates p53, in part, by promoting MDMX
degradation through L11-MDM2 binding, which enhances MDMX
ubiquitination (21–24). MDMX overexpression leads to sequestration of p53 into inactive complexes and abrogates p53-mediated
cell cycle arrest in response to ribosomal stress (24).
MDMX overexpression has been found in 40% of tumor cell lines
(25), and in breast, colon, and lung tumor samples with 18.5%
frequency (26). It is amplified in 4% of glioblastomas (27) and 5% of
breast tumors (26). More recently, f60% of retinoblastomas have
been found to have MDMX overexpression or gene amplification
(28). MDMX overexpression prevents oncogenic ras-induced
premature senescence in mouse fibroblasts and cooperates with
activated ras to confer tumorigenic potential in nude mice (26).
RNAi-mediated knockdown of MDMX in HCT116 tumor cells
suppresses tumor xenograft formation in nude mice (24). Because
MDM2 and MDMX overexpression or deregulation mainly occurs
in tumors that retain wild-type p53, they are appealing targets for
cancer drug discovery.
The extensive validation of MDM2 as a drug target resulted in
the development of Nutlin, which can activate p53 by disrupting
MDM2-p53 complex in tumor cells and tumor xenograft models
(29). MDM2 and MDMX showed f50% amino acid sequence
identity in their p53-binding domains. However, recent studies
reveal that Nutlin is inefficient for disruption of MDMX-p53
interaction and failed to activate p53 in cells overexpressing
MDMX (30–32). Knockdown of MDMX cooperates with Nutlin to
activate p53 in tumor cells and induces growth arrest. These results
suggest that development of novel inhibitors optimized for dualinhibition of MDM2 and MDMX is necessary to achieve full
activation of p53.
In this study, we used phage display to identify a novel peptide
that can inhibit p53 interactions with MDM2 (IC50 = 10 nmol/L)
and MDMX (IC50 = 100 nmol/L) in vitro. Expression of a scaffold
protein (thioredoxin) displaying this peptide sequence by recombinant adenovirus for the first time achieved disruption of both
MDM2 and MDMX interaction with p53, resulting in efficient p53
activation and apoptosis of MDMX-overexpressing tumor cells in

culture and in mice in a p53-dependent fashion. These results show
the advantage of targeting both MDM2 and MDMX for p53
activation and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, and provide a
novel structural motif for the design of potent p53 activators.

Materials and Methods
Phage display. An M13 phage library (Ph.D.-12, New England Biolabs)
encoding random 12-mer peptides at the NH2 terminus of pIII coat protein
(2.7  109 sequences) was used. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MDM21-150 and GST-MDMX-1-200 fusion proteins containing the p53 binding
domain of human MDM2 and MDMX were expressed in E. coli and loaded
onto glutathione-agarose beads. The loaded beads were incubated with
blocking buffer [0.1 mol/L NaHCO3 (pH 8.6), 5 mg/mL bovine serum
albumin (BSA), 0.02% NaN3] for 1 h at 4jC, washed with TBST [50 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20], and incubated in TBST at
4jC with 4  1010 phages. Bound phages were eluted with 0.2 mol/L glycine
(pH 2.2), 1 mg/mL BSA and neutralized with 1 mol/L Tris (pH 9.1). The
eluted phages were amplified as instructed by the manufacturer. The
binding/amplification process was repeated for four cycles for both targets.
Phage DNA was prepared and the region of interest was sequenced.
Fusion protein construction. E. coli thioredoxin was used as a scaffold
to display structurally constrained peptides. Double-stranded oligonucleotide (5¶-GTCCGCCTCTGAGTTTGACGTTTGAGCATTATTGGGCGCAGTTGACGTCGGAAAACG) encoding pDI was cloned into the RsrII site of
pBAD/Thio vector (Invitrogen). The complete thioredoxin-coding region
with the peptide insert was amplified by PCR (using 5¶-GGTCGACCCATGGGATCTGATAAAATTATTCATC-3¶, 5¶-GCTCGAGGGCCAGGTTAGCGTCG-3¶
primers), cleaved with SalI and XhoI, and cloned into pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP-1
vector (Stratagene). The plasmid was linearized with PmeI and cotransformed
into E. coli BJ5183 with adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. Recombinant plasmids were linearized with PacI and transfected into AD-293 cells
(Stratagene) to generate viruses. Recombinant adenoviruses were purified by
ultracentrifugation on CsCl2 gradients and titered using the Adeno-X Rapid
Titer Kit (Clontech).
ELISA assay. GST-MDM2-1-150 and GST-MDMX-1-200 containing
human MDM2 and MDMX, respectively, and His6-tagged human p53
expressed in E. coli were used in ELISA as previously described (30).
GST pull-down assay. 35S[Methionine]-labeled MDMX and MDM2 were
generated using the TNT in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega).
Five microliters of the translation products were mixed and incubated with
glutathione-agarose beads loaded with 5 Ag of GST-p53-1-52 in lysis buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5%
NP40, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] for 2 h at 4jC. The beads
were washed with lysis buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and bound
MDMX and MDM2 were detected by autofluorography.
Cell lines and antibodies. Tumor cell lines H1299 (lung, p53-null), U2OS
(bone), MCF-7 (breast), JEG-3 (placenta), and DLD-1 (breast) were maintained
in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. HCT116-p53 +/+ and HCT116-p53 /

cells were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Department of Oncology,
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD); retinoblastoma Y79 cell line was
provided by Dr. George Blanck (Department of Biochemistry, University of
South Florida, Tampa, FL); and normal human foreskin fibroblasts were
provided by Dr. Jack Pledger (Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL). A U2OS stable
cell line with MDMX overexpression and U2OS stable cell line, expressing
tetracycline-regulated human MDM2 and MDMX were previously described
(14, 30). The following antibodies were used in the experiment: 3G9 (mouse)
and a rabbit polyclonal serum for MDM2 Western blot and immunoprecipitation; DO-1 (PharMingen) and FL393 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for p53
Western blot; 8C6 monoclonal or a rabbit polyclonal serum for MDMX Western
blot and immunoprecipitation; and anti-p21WAF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
for p21. p53 ubiquitination assay was done as previously described (14).
Animal studies. Athymic-NCr-nu female mice, between 7 and 8 weeks of
age, were inoculated s.c. on both flanks with 5  106 HCT116 cells. Tumor
formation was followed for 4 to 6 days. When tumor size reached f0.2 cm3,
the mice were injected with 5  1010 plaque-forming units (pfu) of Ad-DI or
control adenoviruses everyday for a total of five times. Tumor volume was
calculated with the formula [(length + width) / 2]3  0.5236. Tumors
recovered after termination of the experiments were fixed in formalin and
paraffin sections were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining with
rabbit antibodies against p53 and FLAG.

Results
Identification of a high-affinity MDM2 and MDMX binding
peptide. To identify novel peptide inhibitors of MDM2 and MDMX,
phage display was used to screen a 12-mer library to obtain peptides
that bind to the p53-binding domains of MDM2 and MDMX. GSTMDM2 and GST-MDMX were used as baits and the binding/
amplification process was repeated for four cycles for both targets.
Phage DNA was prepared and the variable region was sequenced.
The results showed that 7 of 10 MDMX-selected and 4 of 10 MDM2selected phages contain the same insert (LTFEHYWAQLTS;
Table 1). This peptide was named pDI for peptide dual inhibitor.
The remaining phages contain unrelated and inactive sequences
when tested by ELISA and were not further characterized.
The results above showed that screens using GST-MDM2 or
GST-MDMX resulted in the selection of the same peptide. This
suggests that pDI has such high affinity for both MDM2 and
MDMX that it outcompeted any potential isoform-specific
peptides by a significant margin. The pDI peptide (LTFEHYWAQLTS) is distinct from the p53 peptide (16-QETFSDLWKLLP28) and the previously identified 12/1 peptide (MPRFMDYWEGLN)
that interacts with MDM2 and MDMX (33), but retains three key
p53 hydrophobic residues (Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26, underlined)
that contact the MDM2 pocket (34, 35). In an ELISA assay, pDI
inhibited MDM2-p53 and MDMX-p53 interactions with IC50 of 10

Figure 1. Disruption of MDM2 and MDMX-p53 interactions by a novel peptide. A and B, phage display–selected pDI and control p3A peptides were tested in an
ELISA assay of GST-MDM2 and GST-MDMX binding to immobilized His6-p53. C and D, glutathione beads loaded with GST-p53-1-52 fusion protein were incubated
with a mixture of in vitro translated MDM2 and MDMX and different concentrations of peptides or Nutlin. Binding of MDM2 and MDMX to GST-p53-1-52 in the
presence of inhibitors was determined by autofluorography after washing and SDS-PAGE.

and 100 nmol/L respectively, which is 15-, 60-, and 300-fold
better than 12/1, Nutlin, and p53 peptide on MDM2 (Fig. 1A and B;
Table 2). Mutation of the three key hydrophobic residues to alanine
(p3A) abrogated MDM2 and MDMX inhibition, suggesting that pDI
mimics p53 binding to MDM2 and MDMX. In a different assay,
pDI also inhibited GST-p53 capture of in vitro translated MDM2
and MDMX with different efficiency (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Nutlin
only blocked MDM2 but had no effect on MDMX-p53 interaction
(Fig. 1D). The 10-fold difference in IC50 for MDM2 and MDMX
suggests that MDMX may bind p53 with higher affinity than
MDM2, which is consistent with its mechanism of p53 inhibition
by sequestration.
Construction of an MDM2 and MDMX inhibitory protein.
After unsuccessful attempts to activate p53 in cells by fusion or
conjugation of pDI to the Antennapedia cell-permeable peptide,
the pDI sequence was inserted into the active center of FLAGtagged E. coli thioredoxin protein that serves as a display scaffold
(ref. 36; Fig. 2A). Adenoviruses expressing the fusion proteins
with wild-type pDI (Ad-DI) and control p3A (Ad-3A) sequences
were constructed (Fig. 2B). The fusion proteins expressed in
infected cells showed diffused cytoplasmic and nuclear staining,
consistent with their small sizes (f15 kDa), and has a half life of
f1 h, which was unrelated to MDM2 binding (data not shown).
The pDI peptide was selected based on its ability to bind MDM2
and MDMX. To test whether insertion of pDI sequence into
thioredoxin conferred the ability to binding MDM2 and MDMX,
cells infected with Ad-DI virus were immunoprecipitated with
FLAG antibody and analyzed for the coprecipitation of endogenous
MDM2 and MDMX. The results showed that the FLAG-DI protein,
but not FLAG-3A, coprecipitated with both MDM2 and MDMX
when expressed in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, FLAG-DI
expression disrupted MDM2-p53 and MDMX-p53 coprecipitations
(Fig. 2D). As expected, Nutlin failed to disrupt MDMX-p53 complex

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

in the same assay. Infection with Ad-DI did not cause p53 Ser15
phosphorylation (data not shown), suggesting that the fusion
protein disrupted p53 binding to MDM2 and MDMX by a
competitive mechanism without triggering DNA damage signaling.
These results showed that the FLAG-DI fusion protein was
expressed at levels sufficient to compete with p53 for binding to
endogenous MDM2 and MDMX.
Activation of p53 by the MDM2 and MDMX inhibitory
protein. Disruption of MDM2-p53 and MDMX-p53 complexes
should result in p53 stabilization and activation. As expected,
infection of tumor cells or normal human foreskin fibroblasts
expressing wild-type p53 with Ad-DI resulted in significant increase
in p53 level and induction of p53 targets (p21, MDM2, and PUMA;
Fig. 3A and B). The effects were not observed using Ad-3A or
Ad-vector control viruses, indicating that they were dependent on
the pDI sequence in the fusion protein. Infection of p53-null
(HCT116-p53 / ) or mutant (DLD1) cell lines failed to induce p53
target genes, indicating that the effect of Ad-DI was p53 dependent
(Fig. 3A and B). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that

Figure 2. Design of recombinant adenovirus for expression of peptide epitopes. A, schematic representation of the scaffold protein E. coli thioredoxin with pDI
and p3A inserted between Gly33 and Pro34 at the active center. B, the coding regions of thioredoxin-DI and thioredoxin-3A were fused to FLAG epitope in the
adenovirus genome. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter drives expression of FLAG-DI or FLAG-3A, and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element allows
coexpression of hrGFP from the same transcript. C, MCF-7 cells were infected with Ad-DI, Ad-3A, and Ad-Vec (MOI, 300) for 48 h and cell lysate was
immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody and blotted for coprecipitation of MDM2 and MDMX. D, MCF-7 cells were treated with Ad-DI, Ad-3A, and Ad-Vec
(MOI, 300) or Nutlin (10 Amol/L) for 48 h and MG132 (30 Amol/L) was added 4 h before harvest. Cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with p53 antibody and blotted
for coprecipitation of MDM2 and MDMX.

the increase in p21 and MDM2 levels was associated with increase
in mRNA (data not shown). Ad-DI infection also activated a stably
integrated p53-responsive reporter, BP100-luc, in HCT116 and
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3C), indicating activation of p53 transcriptional
function. Although FLAG-DI was diffusely localized to both nucleus
and cytoplasm, MDM2 and p53 induced by its expression were
predominantly nuclear. As expected, Ad-DI infection inhibited p53
ubiquitination by MDM2 (data not shown), consistent with its
ability to disrupt MDM2-p53 binding. Cell cycle analysis by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) revealed an f10-fold
reduction of S-phase population in the Ad-DI–infected HCT116p53 +/+ cells but not in HCT116-p53 / cells (Fig. 3D). Ad-DI
infection also induced significant apoptosis in HCT116-p53 +/+ cells,
but was much less effective in HCT116-p53 / cells (Fig. 3D).
Therefore, the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis activities of Ad-DI are
mediated by activation of p53.
Activation of p53 in cells overexpressing MDMX. Nutlin does
not disrupt MDMX-p53 binding when applied at practical
concentrations dictated by solubility and nonspecific toxicity
(5–10 Amol/L). Therefore, p53 activation by Nutlin is attenuated
in cells overexpressing MDMX (30–32). To test whether Ad-DI is

www.aacrjournals.org

more efficient in activating p53 in cells overexpressing MDMX,
JEG3 (high MDM2 and MDMX) and Y79 (high MDMX) cells were
treated with the virus (24, 28). The results showed that Ad-DI
infection resulted in significant apoptosis in both cell lines,
whereas Nutlin was less effective (Fig. 4A). These results suggested
that FLAG-DI is able to overcome physiologic levels of MDM2 and
MDMX overexpression.
To further test the ability of FLAG-DI in overcoming higher levels
of MDM2 and MDMX overexpression, U2OS cells expressing
tetracycline-regulated MDM2 (f8 endogenous level) and MDMX
(f8 endogenous level) were treated with Ad-DI and Nutlin.
The results showed that, as expected, Nutlin remained highly
effective even when MDM2 is overexpressed, whereas MDMX
overexpression completely abrogated the ability of Nutlin to
activate p53 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the activity of Ad-DI was only
moderately inhibited by MDM2 and MDMX overexpression,
consistent with a competitive mechanism of FLAG-DI action.
Similar assay using U2OS overexpressing even higher levels of
MDMX (30 endogenous level, noninducible) also showed the
ability of Ad-DI to activate p53 under conditions when Nutlin
was completely ineffective (data not shown). In addition, FACS

and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assays showed that Ad-DI induced significant apoptosis
in U2OS-MDMX cells, which were completely resistant to Nutlin
(Fig. 4C and D). Treatment of normal human foreskin fibroblasts
with Ad-DI did not cause apoptosis (data not shown). This is
expected because most nontransformed cell types do not undergo
apoptosis on p53 activation (37). These results suggested that
FLAG-DI is an efficient activator of p53 in tumor cells over-

expressing MDM2 and MDMX due to its ability to neutralize both
proteins.
Antitumor effects of MDM2 and MDMX inhibition. To test the
antitumor potential of Ad-DI, HCT116 tumor xenografts (f0.2 cm3)
were treated with daily single intratumoral (i.t.) injection of 5  1010
pfu Ad-DI or control virus for 5 consecutive days. This resulted in
90% suppression of tumor growth for the following 16 days by Ad-DI
but not by control viruses or buffer (Fig. 5A). The differences in

Reduction of S phase was analyzed by propidium iodide staining and FACS. Apoptosis was measured by the level of sub-G1 fraction in FACS analysis.

for 48 h and analyzed by FACS for apoptotic sub-G1 population. B, U2OS expressing inducible MDMX (Tet-on) and MDM2 (Tet-off) were treated with 0.1 Ag/mL
tetracycline for 18 h, followed by treatment with Ad-DI (MOI, 100) or Nutlin (10 Amol/L) for additional 24 h, and p53 activation markers were analyzed by Western
blot. C, U2OS and U2OS-MDMX cells were treated with Ad-DI (MOI, 300) and Nutlin (10 Amol/L) for 48 h and analyzed by FACS for sub-G1 population. D, U2OS
and U2OS-MDMX cells were treated with Ad-DI and Nutlin at indicated concentrations for 5 d and analyzed by MTT assay for cell viability.

tumor suppression effects of Ad-DI (n = 10), Ad-3A (n = 6), Ad-vector
(n = 8), and buffer (n = 17) were statistically significant (P < 0.01).
Similar treatment of larger tumors (>0.5 cm3) resulted in moderate
growth inhibition in only a subset of animals (data not shown), most
likely due to limited access of the virus to distant parts of the tumor.
Strong induction of p53, MDM2, and p21 was observed in the extract
of tumors 48 h after injection with Ad-DI (Fig. 5B). Immunohistochemical staining of tumor serial sections showed localized
expression of FLAG-DI in the nucleus and cytoplasm of tumor cells
near the sites of injection, which correlates with significant p53
staining in the same area (Fig. 5C).
Consistent with cell culture results, the antitumor effect of Ad-DI
was strictly dependent on p53. The growth of HCT116-p53 /
tumor xenograft was not inhibited by Ad-DI (n = 6) and Ad-3A
(n = 6, P > 0.05; Fig. 5D). Furthermore, Ad-DI also inhibited the
growth of tumor xenograft formed by a modified HCT116-MDMX
cell line overexpressing MDMX (f5-fold; Fig. 5D; ref. 24; P < 0.01,
n = 5) and induced p53 activation, as determined by Western blot
and immunohistochemical staining (data not shown). Ad-DI and
control viruses were well tolerated in mice after i.t. administration,
with no observable weight loss or pathologic changes of different
organs (data not shown).

Discussion

MDMX in cancer is still limited, cell culture experiments suggest
that MDMX is a significant player in suppressing p53 activity in at
least a subset of tumors. Several studies of MDMX expression in
clinical samples also strongly implicate its involvement in cancer
development. These observations suggest a need to further evaluate the potential of MDMX as a therapeutic target. Currently, the
most attractive approach for targeting MDMX is to use small
molecules to disrupt MDMX-p53 association. MDMX knockout and
RNAi provided valuable evidence for the functional importance of
MDMX in regulating p53. However, because MDMX also interacts
with other molecules such as MDM2 and casein kinase 1, MDMX
depletion does not provide the best simulation of disrupting
MDMX-p53 binding.
The MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin was developed specifically for
MDM2 (40, 41). Interestingly, we and others showed that Nutlin
is at least 30-fold less efficient in disrupting MDMX-p53 binding
(30–32). When applied at practical concentrations, Nutlin is likely
to function only by inhibiting MDM2. MDMX is also insensitive
to a class of small-molecule MDM2 inhibitors that are a-helical
mimics based on the terphenyl scaffold (42).1 These observations
suggest that the p53-binding pockets on MDM2 and MDMX have
differences that affect the binding of small molecules. Such
differences may also compromise the effect of other small
molecules optimized for MDM2.

Recent studies suggest that MDM2 regulates p53 mainly by
promoting its degradation, whereas MDMX acts by sequestration
of p53 (38, 39). Although current understanding of the role of

Figure 5. Antitumor activity of Ad-DI. A, nude mice bearing HCT116-p53 +/+ xenografts were treated with Ad-DI, Ad-3A, Ad-vector, or buffer by daily i.t. injections
(5  1010 pfu/injection) for 5 consecutive days. The tumor volumes were measured every 2 d after completion of treatment cycle. B, representative tumor samples
recovered 48 h after injection were analyzed by Western blot. C, representative tumor specimens 48 h after injection with Ad-DI and Ad-3A were stained for p53 and
FLAG in serial sections. D, HCT116-p53 / and HCT116-MDMX tumor xenografts were treated with i.t. injection of 5  1010 Ad-DI or Ad-3A for 5 consecutive
days. Tumor growth was measured for the indicated time frame after completion of injections.

For therapeutic applications, it is beneficial to have an inhibitor
that is dual-specific for MDM2 and MDMX. Our attempts to screen
for MDM2 and MDMX binding peptides in this study resulted in
the identification of the same sequence motif. This finding suggests
that MDM2 and MDMX have similar binding specificity to peptide
sequences, which is distinct from their interactions with small
molecules. It is possible that peptides rely on extensive contacts
with the p53 binding pockets and is not sensitive to minor
differences that affect small-molecule ligands. Interestingly, in both
ELISA and GST pull-down assays, disruption of MDMX-p53
interaction always requires f10-fold higher concentrations of
the pDI peptide. This suggests that MDMX may bind p53 with
higher affinity than MDM2, which is consistent with its mechanism
of p53 inhibition by forming stable complexes.
Our results showed that simultaneous inhibition of MDM2 and
MDMX binding to p53 has strong proapoptotic potential in cell
culture and can efficiently suppress tumor growth in vivo. The
ability of Ad-DI to induce apoptosis is a significant contrast to
Nutlin, which induces cell cycle arrest in most tumor cell lines
(41). It is possible that the ability of FLAG-DI to target both
MDM2 and MDMX caused p53 activation over the apoptotic

threshold. These results provide a proof-of-principle for the
antitumor potential of MDM2/MDMX dual inhibitors. The potent
pDI peptide also provides a novel motif for structural study of
MDM2 and MDMX interactions with a high-affinity ligand and
should aid the design of small-molecule inhibitors. Cancer
therapy using the Ad-DI virus may be limited by the efficiency
of delivery to large tumors. However, it is possible that gene
therapy is a useful approach against certain tumors such as
retinoblastoma, 60% of which overexpress MDMX (28). In such
cases, the small tumor sizes, enclosed environment, and a need
to avoid genotoxicity and preserve vision may make it a potential
therapeutic option (43).
