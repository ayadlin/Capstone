BACKGROUND. From 20% to 30% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL) who are treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) develop recurrent
disease. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is an effective agent for the salvage of patients
with recurrent APL, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) has shown activity in
patients with APL.

METHODS. The authors investigated the efficacy of a combination of ATO, ATRA,
and GO in 8 patients with APL in first recurrence (7 patients with hematologic
recurrences and 1 patient with a molecular recurrence). All patients had received

previous treatment with ATRA either alone or in combination with other agents.
Patients received ATO 0.15 mg/kg intravenously until they achieved a bone
marrow complete remission (CR). Once in CR, patients received consolidation

with ATO, ATRA, and GO for 10 months. Patients then received maintenance with
idarubicin, ATRA, 6-marcaptopurine, and oral methotrexate for 11 months.

RESULTS. All 7 patients who had hematologic recurrences achieved CR after a
median of 39 days (range, 21–56 days). After a median follow-up of 36 months
(range, 4–55 months), 6 patients remained alive in CR, and 2 patients died in CR.
Six of 8 patients remained in second CR that was longer than their first CR. All
7 evaluable patients achieved molecular remission. There were no grade 3 or
4 extramedullary toxicities. Two patients died, 1 secondary to a complication of
metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, and the other of sepsis.

CONCLUSIONS. The combination of ATO, ATRA, and GO was effective and may
achieve durable remissions in patients with APL in first recurrence. It should be
considered as an effective alternative to allogeneic or autologous transplantation.

cute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a biologically distinct
form of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). It is characterized by
the presence of a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of
chromosomes 15 and 17 [t(15;17)] that fuses the gene encoding for
the nuclear receptor for retinoic acid (RAR-a) to the promyelocytic
leukemia (PML) gene, leading to a PML-RAR-a fusion gene.
Although it is unclear how this translocation results in leukemogenesis, there is evidence that PML/RAR-a impairs terminal differentiation and subsequent apoptosis of promyelocytes.1,2 Patients with
APL present with a unique tendency to disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy, which increases their morbidity and mortality during
induction.3 The introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to APL

therapy has improved outcomes greatly.4–9 The current standard treatment for APL consists of ATRA
and anthracyclines with or without cytarabine. With
this regimen, remission rates from 70% to 95% have
been reported, and the cure rate has doubled from
approximately 35% to >70%.4–6,8,9
Despite these results, approximately 20% to 30%
of patients with APL still develop recurrent disease
and require salvage therapy.5 Until recently, salvage
regimens consisted of chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), and the latter
often was considered the only proven curative
approach. Experience with autologous SCT in patients
with APL also suggested that this approach might be
useful.3 These strategies may be associated with high
morbidity and mortality rates. Arsenic trioxide (ATO)
has proven to be very effective in achieving high complete remission (CR) rates in patients with APL10,11
and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of recurrent APL.
Some studies have suggested synergy between ATRA
and ATO. In a study by Shen et al., untreated patients
were randomized to receive ATRA, ATO, or ATRA plus
ATO as induction therapy.10 Patients who received the
combination had the greatest reduction in PML-RARa transcript numbers at the time of CR and had the
lowest recurrence rate. Gemtuzumab ozogamycin
(GO) is an anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody with activity against APL when it is used as a single agent or in
combination with ATRA and chemotherapy.12,13 We
conducted a pilot study of the combination of ATO,
ATRA, and GO to determine the feasibility, tolerability,
and efficacy of this approach in patients with recurrent APL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From March 2001 to December 2005, adults with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory APL after initial
treatment with a regimen that included ATRA and
chemotherapy were eligible for this study. Other eligibility criteria included 1) confirmation of translocation (15;17) by conventional cytogenetics analysis or
positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PML/RAR-a, 2) serum creatinine
and bilirubin levels <2 mg/L, 3) adequate cardiac
function (patients with New York Heart Association
cardiac Class III and IV function were excluded),
and 4) signed informed consent. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board, and all
patients signed an informed consent according to
institutional guidelines.

Prior to therapy patients had a complete blood
cell count and differential (CBC); blood chemistry;
coagulation profile, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, fibrin split products, and D-dimer; electrocardiogram (EKG) and
chest x-ray; and bone marrow (BM) aspiration with
cytogenetic analysis and RT-PCR for PML/RAR-a.
During therapy, patients were monitored by CBCs,
coagulation profiles, and weekly EKGs until they
achieved a response. BM aspirations were done at
remission, after ATO Courses 3 and 5, then every 4 to
6 months, and at the completion of the study. RTPCR was monitored at CR and every 3 to 6 months
thereafter.

Treatment
The regimen for remission induction consisted of
ATO 0.15 mg/kg intravenously daily until BM remission was achieved; then, patients were observed until
their counts recovered to meet standard CR criteria.14
Consolidation treatment was initiated once CR was
achieved or 60 days after the start of induction therapy and consisted of 1) ATO 0.15 mg/kg intravenously daily for 5 days every week for 4 weeks and
repeated every 8 weeks for total of 5 courses, 2)
ATRA 45 mg/m2 orally twice daily for 10 days every
month for 10 months, and 3) GO 9 mg/m2 intravenously every month for 10 months (premedication
with solumedrol 50 mg intravenously). Subsequent
maintenance therapy consisted of 1) idarubicin
8 mg/m2 daily on Days 1 and 2 every month for
3 months, 2) ATRA 45 mg/m2 daily for 10 days every
month for 14 months, 3) 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)
50 mg orally 3 times daily for 11 months, and 4)
methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg/m2 orally every week for
11 months. The initiation of idarubicin, 6-MP, and
MTX was delayed if the absolute neutrophil count
was <1.0 3 109/L and/or if the platelet count was
<75 3 109/L.
Response Definitions and Statistical Considerations
A CR was defined by using conventional criteria;
including cellular BM blasts and abnormal
promyelocytes <5%, an absolute neutrophil count
1.0 3 109/L, and a platelet count 100 3 109/L.14
Remission duration was measured from the date CR
was achieved to the date of clinical recurrence. A
molecular CR was defined as a negative PCR result
from BM studies with a sensitivity of 104. Clinical
recurrence was defined as the presence of 5%
blasts, or abnormal promyelocytes in the BM, or the
appearance of leukemic cells in peripheral blood.
Survival was measured from the time of treatment
until death. The primary endpoint of the study was

Combined ATO, ATRA, and GO in APL/Aribi et al.

the rate of PCR negativity at 12 months with the
objective of achieving a rate 30%. The rules for
stopping treatment were designed to ensure that the
PCR-negative rate at 12 months was not <30%
(P ¼ .05 with a power of .80). Therefore, the study
would be stopped if the numbers of treated patients
who had PCR-negative results at 12 months were as
follows: 0 of 7 patients, 2 of 15 patients, 4 of 25
patients, and 6 of 40 patients. Secondary endpoints
included CR duration, survival, induction mortality,
complication, and hospitalization.

RESULTS
Eight patients with recurrent APL were treated during
first recurrence (1 patient was in hematologic CR but
with molecular recurrence). Their median age was 51
years (range, 18–68 years). Baseline characteristics

treatment with ATRA-based regimens. Prior therapy
included liposomal ATRA alone (n ¼ 2 patients);
ATRA with idarubicin (n ¼ 1 patient); ATRA with
idarubicin plus high-dose cytarabine (n ¼ 1 patient);
ATRA and GO (n ¼ 2 patients); liposomal ATRA, vitamin E, and interferon a (n ¼ 1 patient); and ATRA,
ATO, and 1 dose of GO (no consolidation or maintenance; n ¼ 1 patient). None of the patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation at
the time of recurrence. The median duration of the
first CR was 18.5 months (range, 7–48 months). All 7
patients with hematologic recurrence achieved a hematologic CR before 60 days: The median time to CR
was 39 days (range, 21–56 days). Eventually, all 8
patients achieved a molecular remission (mCR) with
a median time to mCR of 4 months (range, 1–6
months). Seven patients had repeated PCR testing, as
described above, and all remained negative. One patient had a suboptimal specimen for evaluation at 3
months and has not reached the 6-month follow-up
evaluation. At the time of CR, 4 patients had cytogenetic studies available for evaluation, and 3 patients
had achieved a cytogenetic CR (Table 2).
All patients received consolidation therapy after
achieving CR (Table 3). Patients 2 and 4 had treatment discontinuation after 4 cycles and 2 cycles,
respectively, because of grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia
that was reversible upon discontinuation of therapy.
Patient 5 died of bacterial sepsis after the seventh
cycle of consolidation. Patient 6 decided to undergo
allogeneic SCT while in CR before he had completed
consolidation therapy (his CR duration at the time of
SCT was 4 months). Three patients (Patients 1, 3, and
7) had completed consolidation therapy, and 1
(Patient 8) was receiving consolidation at the time of
this report. Three patients received maintenance
therapy: Patient 1 completed all maintenance ther-

apy, Patient 3 received only 1 cycle of idarubicin
because of mucositis during the first cycle and died
of lung cancer during maintenance therapy, and
Patient 7 still was receiving maintenance at the time
of this report. The latter patient received maintenance without ATRA or idarubicin at the patient’s
request. After a median follow-up of 36 months
(range, 4–55 months), 6 patients remained alive in
CR, and 2 patients died in CR (1 from metastatic
lung adenocarcinoma and 1 from sepsis).
Treatment was tolerated well during induction
therapy. None of the patients developed coagulopathy during therapy. There was no dose adjustment
except in 1 patient who had her ATO dose reduced
to 0.11 mg/kg per day secondary to grade 2 vaginal
bleeding, probably unrelated to therapy. The most
common side effects during consolidation therapy
were grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression in 7 patients.
Two patients had a grade 2 increase in serum bilirubin level, which improved with treatment discontinuation. A work-up that included liver biopsy in 1
patient showed no evidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. One patient developed grade 2 peripheral neuropathy that required an ATO dose reduction
after 4 months of treatment. Three patients developed neutropenic fever. Two patients had bacterial
sepsis, and 1 of those patients died as a consequence
of this complication. None of the patients developed
differentiation or ATRA syndrome. Other side effects

DISCUSSION
A standard treatment for recurrent APL has not been
defined to date. Several effective drugs and
approaches with different success rates have been
described. Treatment options for recurrent APL
include reinstitution of the same treatment, ATO, GO,
and allogeneic or autologous SCT.15
ATO has been approved as standard therapy in
APL salvage. The first report of ATO activity in recurrent APL was from a Chinese study of 47 patients: In
that study, the CR rate was 84%, and the 2-year survival probability was 50%. A multicenter study in the
United States of 52 patients reported a CR rate of
87%, an mCR rate of 83%, and 2-year recurrence-free
and overall survival rates of 49% and 63% respectively. In that study, although some patients underwent transplantation in CR, the 18-month
recurrence-free survival rate was 58% when patients
were censored at the time of transplantation.16–18
Because of the strong expression of CD33 antigen on
the surface of APL cells, their selective targeting by
anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies was proven effective in patients with untreated and recurrent APL
when such antibodies were used as single agents or
in combination with ATRA with or without idarubicin.12 Furthermore, GO has shown activity in minimal residual disease. In a study of 16 patients with
APL in molecular recurrence who received treatment
with GO, 14 patients (87%) achieved an mCR, and 7
patients (43%) remained in mCR for a median of 15
months.13
In the current study, we demonstrated the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with ATO,
ATRA, and GO, which resulted in high rates of CR
and mCR in recurrent APL. Of the 7 patients who
had hematologic recurrences, all 7 achieved a CR
within a median of 39 days. In addition, all patients
who were treated achieved an mCR after a median of
17 weeks. Most toxicities were minor and transient,
and the most common toxicities were myelosuppression and neutropenic fever. We did not observe the
hyperleukocytosis syndrome associated with ATRA or
cardiac toxicities in this study.
The high CR and mCR rates of 100% from this
study compare favorably with the rates obtained by
using ATRA, ATO, and GO as single therapies. The
durability of second remission (36 months) compared with the durability of first remission (18
months), the acceptable toxicity profile, and eventfree survival rates comparable to the rates reported

Combined ATO, ATRA, and GO in APL/Aribi et al.

in patients who received ATO followed by allogeneic
or autologous SCT make this regimen attractive for
the treatment of recurrent APL. However, the current
results should be interpreted with caution, because
our sample size was small, and only 3 patients
received maintenance. In addition, it is difficult to
assess the contribution of the different components
of the treatment regimen. Also, the need for maintenance therapy is not clear, because only 3 patients
received that portion of the therapy. Additional studies are required to determine the efficacy and optimal scheduling of this or similar regimens.
We conclude that combined therapy with ATO,
ATRA, and GO and possibly maintenance in recurrent APL induces durable remissions in most
patients. Further studies with more patients are
needed to evaluate this strategy as an alternative for
patients with recurrent or refractory APL.
