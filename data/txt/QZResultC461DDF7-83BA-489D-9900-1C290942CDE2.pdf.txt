ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal of all human malignancies
with its incidence nearly equaling its mortality rate. Therefore, it’s crucial to identify
newer mechanism-based agents and targets to effectively manage pancreatic cancer.
Plant-derived agents/drugs have historically been useful in cancer therapeutics.
Sanguinarine is a plant alkaloid with anti-proliferative effects against cancers,
including pancreatic cancer. This study was designed to determine the mechanism of
sanguinarine’s effects in pancreatic cancer with a hope to obtain useful information to
improve the therapeutic options for the management of this neoplasm. We employed
a quantitative proteomics approach to define the mechanism of sanguinarine’s effects
in human pancreatic cancer cells. Proteins from control and sanguinarine-treated
pancreatic cancer cells were digested with trypsin, run by nano-LC/MS/MS, and
identified with the help of Swiss-Prot database. Results from replicate injections were
processed with the SIEVE software to identify proteins with differential expression.
We identified 37 differentially expressed proteins (from a total of 3107), which are
known to be involved in variety of cellular processes. Four of these proteins (IL33,
CUL5, GPS1 and DUSP4) appear to occupy regulatory nodes in key pathways. Further
validation by qRT-PCR and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that the dual specificity
phosphatase-4 (DUSP4) was significantly upregulated by sanguinarine in BxPC-3 and
MIA PaCa-2 cells. Sanguinarine treatment also caused down-regulation of HIF1α and
PCNA, and increased cleavage of PARP and Caspase-7. Taken together, sanguinarine
appears to have pleotropic effects, as it modulates multiple key signaling pathways,
supporting the potential usefulness of sanguinarine against pancreatic cancer.

chemotherapy has not shown desired therapeutic outcome,
it is crucial to identify novel mechanism-based modalities
that can be effectively used alone or in conjunction with
existing therapeutics for the management of this dreaded
cancer.
From ancient time, natural products, including
plant-alkaloids, have been a fertile source for anti-cancer
drugs. Sanguinarine (13-methyl-[1,3]benzodioxolo[5,6-c]1,3-dioxolo[4,5-i]phenanthridinium) is a bioactive
benzophenanthridine alkaloid found in plants of the
Papaveraceae family, blood root plant Sanguinaria

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers
because it is difficult to diagnose early, and is relatively
resistant to treatment. The overall incidence of pancreatic
cancer as well as mortality associated with it has not
improved over the past several decades. It has an extremely
poor prognosis, with ~20% one-year survival and a bleak
~3% five-year survival. In the United States alone, 46,420
new cases and 39,590 pancreatic cancer related deaths
are predicted for year 2014 [1]. Since the conventional

Mexicana [2]. Plants synthesize sanguinarine from
dihydrosanguinarine through the action of dihydro­
benzophenanthridine oxidase. Sanguinarine has been
shown to possess broad spectrum pharmacological
properties including anti-microbial, anti-oxidative and
anti-inflammatory activities [2]. Several in vitro and
in vivo studies have demonstrated sanguinarine’s anticancer properties in variety of cancers [3–15]. We have
previously demonstrated that sanguinarine imparts antiproliferative effects in human epidermoid carcinoma
(A431) cells without affecting normal cells (human
epidermal keratinocytes) [10]. We have also demonstrated
that sanguinarine imparts anti-proliferative effects
against pancreatic cancer cells, AsPC-1 and BxPC-3, via
modulation in Bcl-2 family proteins [9].
Therefore, sanguinarine has shown excellent
developmental promise for treatment of cancer, including
pancreatic cancer. This necessitates a need for a more in
depth understanding of mechanism(s) of sanguinarine’s
action, which may be useful in multiple ways. First,
identification of mechanistic signature of sanguinarine in
pancreatic cancer cells may further validate if this alkaloid
is a suitable candidate for anti-cancer drug development.
Second, this may also help in identifying genes and/
or protein targets modulated by sanguinarine that could
be developed as surrogate biomarkers in preclinical
studies and future clinical trials. Finally, this may also
lead to discovery of novel targets for the management of
pancreatic cancer.
Thus, the objective of this study was to decipher
the molecular mechanism of the anti-proliferative effects
of sanguinarine by interrogating the proteomics changes
incurred by sanguinarine treatment in pancreatic cancer
cells. For this purpose, we chose a label-free nanoESI ultra high resolution mass spectrometry approach
employing Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass
spectrometer. Indeed, quantitative proteomics combined
with bioinformatics is a powerful tool that can be used to
reveal the complex molecular events in biological systems.
The speed and efficiency of modern mass spectrometers
allow data from thousands of peptides to be collected
in a few hours. Database searching and post-processing
can then be used to reveal quantitative changes in
proteins from a broad array of biochemical and signaling
pathways. In order to determine the molecular signatures
associated with sanguinarine’s anti-proliferative response,
we subjected sanguinarine treated BxPC-3 pancreatic
cancer cells to quantitative proteomics using SIEVE, a
label-free relative quantitation strategy that uses rigorous
statistics to quantitate LC-MS/MS peptide peaks. Labelfree approaches are becoming more popular due to the
vast improvements in instrumentation capabilities, as
well as the relative lower cost of label-free experiments
in comparison to stable isotope labelling such as Stable
Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification
(iTRAQ) [16]. The Q-Exactive mass spectrometer is
particularly well suited for label free quantitation due to its
fast scanning speed and high resolving power. The SIEVE
software tool calculates peptide ratios based on variation
in the MS peak intensities between sample populations
[16]. Peptide ratio data in SIEVE can be stringently
filtered using multiple statistical models, including ratio,
p-values (Fishers Combined Probability), and coefficient
of variance scores between biological replicates which
can be used to assess sample variability. SIEVE has an
advantage over label-free spectral counting methods as it
has the capability of quantitating lower abundant proteins/
peptides which may show up in LC-MS/MS with relatively
little MS/MS spectral data. In this study, we identified 37
differentially expressed proteins (from a total of 3107),
which may be useful in creating a molecular signature
of sanguinarine that may be significantly relevant to
pancreatic cancer.

RESULTS
Effect of sanguinarine on proteome profile of
human pancreatic cancer cells
As a first step to identify the effect of sanguinarine
on global proteome changes, we determined the best
effective dose regimen for sanguinarine treatment using
two human pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3 and
MIA PaCa-2. BxPC-3 cells represent adenocarcinoma
of moderate to poor differentiation with high angiogenic
potential while MIA PaCa-2 are poorly differentiated
carcinoma with low levels of pro-angiogenic factors
[17]. Anti-proliferative effect of sanguinarine (0.1, 0.2,
0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 μM; for 24 and 48 h) in BxPC3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were analyzed using an MTT
assay. Both cell lines showed a dose and time dependent
decrease in OD570 following treatment with sanguinarine,
indicating a decrease in cellular proliferation/metabolism
(Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B). We further assessed
the effect of sanguinarine (24 h treatment) against BxPC3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells on the cell growth and viability
using trypan blue exclusion assay, and clonogenic
survival, where equal number of sanguinarine treated cells
were allowed to grow for 14 days followed by staining
with crystal violet, and noticed significant inhibition in all
three parameters. The cell morphology, growth, viability
and clonogenic survival data are shown in Supplementary
Figure 2A, 2B and 2C. We observed that sanguinarine
resulted in a significant reduction in cell growth at 1 and
2 μM concentrations. However, a significant decrease
in viability was observed only at 2 μM concentration of
sanguinarine (Supplementary Figure 2B). Collectively,
our data show that sanguinarine at lower concentration (<
1 μM) did not have much effect whereas 2 μM seems to
produce excessive cell killing in both BxPC-3 and MIA
10336

PaCa-2 cells. Thus, we selected 1 μM concentration of
sanguinarine (for 24 h) in BxPC-3 cells for proteomics
analysis.
We performed a pre-validation experiment running
duplicate injections of two biological replicate samples
prepared identically. The pre-validation is important
because despite advances in instrument technology and
performance, data-dependent LC/MS/MS analysis of
complex proteomics samples is still affected by undersampling. This results run-to-run and sample-to-sample
variability in the peptides selected for MS/MS analysis
and which can be identified [18]. It is critical to have an
understanding of the magnitude of this under-sampling
so that sufficient replicate runs are done to have adequate
statistical significance. When we compared the variability
between duplicate injections of the same sample using a 2%
false discovery rate (FDR) in our database search (lower
than used in our actual analyses) we found 68% overlap.
Comparing the overlap between biological replicates
using 2% FDR we found a 66% overlap at the protein

identification level (data not shown). Based on these, we
elected to perform 6 replicate injections of each sample in
our experimental protocol as shown in Figure 1A.
A crucial step in post-acquisition data processing
is alignment of the base peak chromatograms. The
SIEVE 2.1 uses a proprietary algorithm, Chromalign
which in addition to aligning chromatogram regions
of interest (in our case from retention time 30 min
−122 min) also provides a measure of the quality of
the alignment. Our data show excellent alignment as
the scores of all the control and sanguinarine treated
samples were ≥ 0.849, (Supplementary Figure 3A and
B). SIEVE requires a score of 0.75 or above for valid
quantitative analysis, scores above 0.85 are considered
an excellent alignment. The output data were searched
against the Swiss-Prot human proteome database
with decoy using the Sequest HT search engine and
further analyzed with the SIEVE 2.1 software to reveal
the proteins with altered expression. This analysis
resulted in a total of 3107 proteins identified at 0.05

Confidence Interval (CI) (Supplementary Table 1).
The majority of these identified proteins showed no
significant difference between treated and untreated
samples. Less than 5% of the proteins (total 148
proteins) identified differed by > 1.5-fold (61
upregulated and 87 downregulated) (Supplementary
Figure 4A). Further, the data of combined replicates
compared at peptide and protein level show an overlap
of 65% and 74%, respectively. The Venn diagram
represented in Supplementary Figure 4B and 4C are
generated using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.) identification software which re-groups
the proteins if a peptide identified is 100% homologous
in two or more different proteins. That’s why the
number of proteins identified by SIEVE 2.1 do not
match with the protein numbers shown in Venn diagram.
SIEVE is a quantification software and does not group
proteins during the quantification because it has no way
of knowing which protein the peptide belongs too. It
gives the ratio data for all of the homologous proteins,
thus inflate the protein numbers.
Out of 3107 identified proteins, we selected 37
proteins showing > 1.8 fold change with statistical
significance ( p-value < 0.05) (Table 1), for further
analysis. The criteria for this selection (> 1.8 fold
change) as a threshold was based on the fact that these
proteins tend to numerically meet the principles of truly
differential expressed proteins. Although some researchers
have considered fold changes even less than 1.8-fold
assuming adequate absolute expression levels, during
validation it generally fail to reach statistical significance.
Details about these 37 proteins which include protein
ID, protein name, molecular weight, number of unique
peptides, frames (defined rectangular region in the m/z vs.
retention time plane), hits (ms/ms identification scans), %
coverage of protein, average p-value and fold change upon
sanguinarine treatment, are presented in Table 1. The fold
change and direction of sanguinarine-modulated proteins
are represented in Figure 1B.

of proteins related with metabolic and cellular processes
(Figure 2B). Sanguinarine also modulate biological
regulation, developmental process, localization, cellular
component organization, multicellular organismal, response
to stimulus, immune system, reproduction and apoptotic
processes. The protein class analysis shows the pleotropic
mode of action of sanguinarine as it affects broad category
of protein classes namely chaperones, transcription factors,
hydrolase, signaling molecules, ligase, enzyme modulators,
transporter, transferase, receptor, cytoskeletal protein,
nucleic acid binding, protease, phosphatase, membrane
traffic protein and kinase (Figure 2C). Taken together, the
data from gene ontology suggest that sanguinarine affects
multiple critical cellular processes that are relevant to cell
growth and proliferation.

Pathway analysis by IPA software
The relationships, putative networks and canonical
pathways analysis of differentially expressed proteins were
performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity
Inc.). The selected 37 proteins (Table 1) were uploaded to
the IPA module with their corresponding Swiss-Prot IDs
and respective fold changes to map proteins into biological
networks and to retrieve functions and key pathways. We
were able to identify association of 26 canonical pathways
with these selected proteins. Among these, the protein
ubiquitination pathway which generally involves in post
translational modification, appears the top hit. The protein
ubiquitination system functions in a variety of cellular
processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle and division, DNA
transcription and repair, response to stress and extracellular
modulators. Further, as shown in Figure 3A, we identified
an involve­ment of several important signaling pathways in
the biological response of sanguinarine.
Next, we organized the sanguinarine-modulated
protein network into distinct interaction networks, to predict
involvement of disease and function-related processes. As
shown in Figure 3B, most of these networks account for
biological functions related to cancer, cell morphology,
cell cycle, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cellular
development and cellular function and maintenance, and
DNA replication, recombination and repair.
The protein-protein networks of sanguinarinemodulated proteins were algorithmically generated based
on their connectivity. The significance values for network
and pathway analyses were computed using Fisher’s
Exact test. Multiple central nodes, namely L33, ERK,
JNK, MAPK, CUL5, GPS1 and DUSP4, were identified
from protein-protein networks (Figure 4). However,
ERK, JNK and MAPK appeared as additional proteins of
this network that were not identified by the proteomics
analysis. The protein interaction networks indicated a
marked association of DUSP4 in anti-proliferative effects
of sanguinarine in pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 4). The
protein networks were further systemized through IPA to
determine which of the identified proteins are involved in

Gene ontology analysis of proteome changes
To better understand the biological pathways being
affected by modulation of protein abundance in response
to sanguinarine, the selected 37 proteins were annotated
with gene ontology (GO) terms using Protein ANnalysis
THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) classifi­
cation system. The distribution of these proteins among
molecular functions, biological processes and protein classes
are illustrated in Figure 2. It is noteworthy that most of the
differentially regulated proteins are involved in binding and
catalytic activity, followed by lesser involvement of enzyme
regulator, nucleic acid binding transcription factor, receptor,
structural molecule and transporter activity (Figure 2A).
The GO analysis on the basis of biological processes, which
show the molecular events pertinent to the functioning of
integrated living system, explored the majorly involvement

cancer-specific distinct interaction networks. As shown in
Supplementary Figure 5, the complex network generated
found DUSP4 as an important hub.

mRNA level of AP3B1, CUL5, FAM160A2 and UACA
were found in sanguinarine treated MIA PaCa-2 cells. IL33
mRNA level in MIA PaCa-2 cells, and PDLIM4 mRNA
level in BxPC-3 cells were not detectable. However, DUSP4
seems to follow the same trend as shown by proteomics
analysis in both cell lines and shows dose-dependent effects.

Validation by qRT-PCR analysis
Changes in protein levels can attributed to regulation
at multiple levels including transcription, translation,
and degradation. To determine if the observed changes
were at the transcription level, we performed a qRTPCR validation of proteomics data. For this purpose,
we included only those proteins that showed > 2.0 fold
differential expression. Out of 37 proteins, only 18 proteins
showed > 2-fold differential expression. This was done
to focus on most obvious/major protein modulated by
sanguinarine. However, out of these 18, only 13 proteins
were detectable and showed consistent results during
qRT-PCR validation. This validation was done in two cell
lines (BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2) at two concentrations of
sanguinarine (1 and 2 μM). A minimum of three biological
replicates were used for final analysis presented in
Figure 5. Overall, we found that most of the modulated
proteins identified in the proteomics analysis seems
to follow the same trend at the transcription level at
sanguinarine 1 μM. However, at the higher concentration
of sanguinarine (2 μM), we observed a different trend of
mRNA changes that was not consistent between the BxPC3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells (Figure 5). Contrary to proteomics
and mRNA data of BxPC-3 cells, decreasing trend of

Validation by immunoblot analysis
Although sanguinarine seems to affect several
regulatory molecules, the observed effect on DUSP4
was consistent and predominantly visible. Therefore,
immunoblot analysis was performed for validation
of changes in DUSP4. Further, we also validated two
additional relevant proteins, HIF1α and PCNA, due
to their well-established association with pancreatic
cancer progression. These proteins were found to be
downregulated in proteomics data, though at less than 1.8
fold. As shown in Figure 6A, immunoblot analysis revealed
an upregulation of DUSP4, and downregulation of HIF1α
and PCNA in sanguinarine treated BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa2 cells in a sanguinarine concentration dependent manner.
In the Figure 6B, we have re-plotted the proteomics data
obtained for DUSP4, HIF1α and PCNA, for a comparison.
We also performed qRT-PCR analysis to assess the mRNA
levels for HIF1α and PCNA. We noticed a dose dependent
decrease in HIF1α and PCNA mRNA level (Figure 6D). In
addition, we determined the effect of sanguinarine on Poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Caspase 7, which are

frequently dysregulated in cancer to allow the cancer cell
to evade apoptosis. As shown in Figure 6C, Sanguinarine
treatment resulted in an increase in a marked cleavage of
PARP and Caspase 7 in both BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2
pancreatic cancer cells. To further confirm the effect of
sanguinarine on apoptosis induction in BxPC-3 and MIA
PaCa-2 cells, we employed flow cytometric analysis using
Annexin V/PI binding and CellQuest 3.0 software system.
The results showed a dose-dependent increase in cells

in apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 6A and 6B).

pancreatic cancer. Data amassed from a number of studies
has suggested that the plant-alkaloid sanguinarine may
have promise in the therapy of cancer, including pancreatic
cancer. The Bloodroot plant (Sanguinaria canadensis)
that contains sanguinarine has a long history of use
in folk-medicine, for treatment of variety of illnesses
including cancer. An internet search reveals current use
of sanguinarine-based modalities for cancer treatment in
veterinary patients. In addition, sanguinarine has widely
been used in toothpaste, mouthwashes and for other
antimicrobial properties [19]. However, these practices
are not based on robust scientific studies. Detailed studies
are needed to ascertain the efficacy, mechanism, and
toxicity of sanguinarine for its potential use as anti-cancer
therapeutics in the modern medicine.
In this study, we employed quantitative proteomics
to determine the mechanism of anti-proliferative effects
of sanguinarine in pancreatic cancer. As described in
‘Results’, our proteomics analysis have revealed that

modulated proteins. The solid lines denote a robust correlation with partner proteins, and dashed lines indicate statistically significant but

sanguinarine modulates multiple key pathways, which are
relevant to cancer growth. We found that a big proportion
of the proteins affected by sanguinarine are involved in
cellular metabolism. This is an interesting finding because
on the way to tumorigenesis and tumor progression, cells
undergo metabolic reprogramming to fulfill their energy
requirement.
Based on IPA analysis (Figure 3A), protein
ubiquitination was identified as the top canonical
pathway affected by sanguinarine in our study. In a
cell, protein ubiquitination adjusts protein turnover by
closely regulating the degradation of protein of interest.
The proteins identified by IPA analysis that are directly
involved in ubiquitin/proteasome pathways include
DUSP4, USP16 and HSPA7. Interestingly, Cagnol and
Rivard have shown that DUSP4 becomes ubiquitinated
and degraded through proteasome, and proteasome
inhibition increases basal DUSP4 expression in nonstimulated BRAFV600E:ER cells [20]. The disease and
functions canonical pathways of the altered proteins
shows that sanguinarine targets a variety of cancer related
processes (Figure 3B). Further, multiple central nodes
(CUL5, IL33, GPS1 and DUSP4) were identified in IPA
analysis to be affected by sanguinarine (Figure 4). These
newly identified ‘central nodes’ are very interesting and
relevant to cancer development and progression.
Cullin-5 (CUL5) is known to inhibit cellular
proliferation. Fay and colleagues have found a decrease
level of CUL5 in human breast tumor tissue supporting its
potential role in breast tumorigenesis [21]. In this study,
we found increased level of CUL5 at the proteomics level
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and mRNA level in BxPC-3 cells (Table 1, Figure 5A).
Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a pro-inflammatory molecule
that has been suggested to act as a crucial mediator in
inflammation-associated pancreatic carcinogenesis [22].
Our proteomics data as well as qRT-PCR data shows
the marked decrease in the expression of IL-33 (Table 1,
Figure 5A). In this study, we found a significant increase in
G protein pathway suppressor 1 (GPS1) by sanguinarine.
GPS1 suppresses G-protein- and mitogen-activated protein
kinase-mediated signal transduction [23]. However,
there is no reported role for GPS1 in pancreatic cancer
at present. Our study also identified the Dual specificity
phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) as a novel protein modulated by
sanguinarine. DUSP4 dephosphorylate both Thr and Tyr
residues on MAP kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) to regulate
the mitogenic signal transduction [24]. DUSP4 shows
higher substrate specificity in vitro for ERK followed
by JNK and P-38, respectively [24, 25]. Interestingly,
oral supplementation of sanguinarine has been shown
to inhibit tumor burden in A375 human melanoma
in athymic nude mice via inhibiting the activation of
mitogen-activated protein kinases (p-p44/42 MAPK) and
protein kinase B (pAKT) [26]. Niu and colleagues have
shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of sanguinarine
are mediated by inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2
phosphorylation [27]. Furthermore, the protein network
data of sanguinarine-modulated proteins show that
DUSP4 negatively regulates ERK, JNK, MAPK. Our
proteomics data followed by qRT-PCR and immunoblot
analysis demonstrated that sanguinarine significantly
increases DUSP4 in pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 and MIA

PaCa-2 cells. The role of DUSP4 in pancreatic cancer
has not yet been explored; however, an association of
DUSP4 loss with cancer progression has been shown in
certain cancers [28, 29]. Balko and colleagues found that
the loss of DUSP4 activates MAPK pathways which in
turn stimulates cancer stem cell-like phenotypes in basallike breast cancer [29]. Recently, Waha et al. have found
frequent epigenetic downregulation of DUSP4 in glioma
[30]. Furthermore, exogenous overexpression of DUSP4
has been shown to inhibit glioblastoma cell growth,
indicating DUSP4 as a possible tumor suppressor [30].
Our study suggests that DUSP4 is an important central
hub, which interacts with several important molecules
modulated by sanguinarine in pancreatic cancer.
In our study, we found that sanguinarine treat­
ment also resulted in a marked cleavage of PARP
and Caspase 7, which are indicative of apopto­
sis induction (Figure 6C). We further confir­
med sanguinarine induces apoptosis using Annexin

V/Propidium Iodide (PI) binding assay (Supplementary
Figure 6A and 6B). This data confirms our previous study
where we demonstrated apoptosis-induction by sanguinarine
in BxPC-3 and AsPC1 cells [9]. Further, the immunoblot
analysis also showed that sanguinarine causes a decrease in
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) and proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in both BxPC-3 and MIA
PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 6A). We also found a
significant decrease in mRNA level of HIF1α and PCNA as
a result of sanguinarine treatment in these cells (Figure 6D).
While PCNA is a marker of cellular proliferation, HIF1α
has been shown to be associated with negative prognosis of
several cancers including pancreatic cancer. In fact, hypoxia
is known to alter cellular metabolism (by transcriptional
activation of genes) and promote neoangiogenesis that
leads to sustained tumor growth and survival [31]. Thus,
it appears that sanguinarine decreases cellular hypoxia and
cell proliferation in addition to apoptosis induction that
leads to inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells.

We have previously demonstrated that BCL-2
family proteins and p53 play the key roles in the biological
effects of sanguinarine in pancreatic cancer cells [9].
Specifically, we found that sanguinarine treatment
resulted in a slight decrease in p53 protein level and a
significant increase in its phosphorylated form [9]. In our
current investigations, p53 appeared in the proteomics
data with negligible change (Supplementary Table 1),
however, phosphorylated p53 and BCL-2 didn’t appear
as visible proteins in criteria selected for quantitative
proteomics analysis. Indeed, studies have shown
associations between p53, BCL-2 and DUSP4. While the
tumor suppressor p53 is a well-known regulator of BCL-2
(based on a number of studies), Shen and colleagues have
shown that DUSP4 is a novel transcription target of p53
[32]. Interestingly, Shen and colleagues have also shown
that DUSP4 can induce apoptosis even in the absence
of p53, thus highlighting the p53-independent role of
DUSP4 in apoptosis signaling [32].

Taken together, our study has suggested a
pleotropic nature of sanguinarine as it negatively
regulates multiple pathways relevant to pancreatic cancer
cell survival. Indeed, studies suggest that pancreatic
cancer is a genetically complex and heterogeneous
disease. A recent study has suggested that the mature
pancreatic cancer cell carries on average 63 genetic
alterations which is a core panel of 12 cellular signaling
pathways and processes that affect 67–100% of the
tumors [33]. Therefore, a successful drug for pancreatic
cancer management will have to affect multiple targets
to attack heterogeneous population of pancreatic cancer
cells. Our study has shown that sanguinarine possesses
these characteristics. In addition to the pathways
identified by our study, sanguinarine has been shown
to modulate several other important pathways. For
example, sanguinarine has been shown to facilitate
the formation and increase the stabilization of DNA
G-quadruplex, which could potentially damage cancer

cells [15]. Importantly, sanguinarine appears to have a
reasonable safety profile as it was found to be safe at a
dose of 5 mg/kg body weight in pigs [34]. In addition, we
have previously shown that sanguinarine doesn’t affect
normal human epidermal keratinocytes at up to 2.0 μM
concentration [10]. Similarly, Sun and colleagues have
shown that 1 μM sanguinarine does not have any effect
on the growth of immortalized normal prostate epithelial
cells [35]. However, further detailed studies, especially
in relevant in vivo models, are needed to further ascertain
the usefulness and efficacy of this promising herbal agent
against pancreatic cancer.

stains non-viable cells), and counted using a Bio-Rad cell
counter (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). For clonogenic cell
survival, following treatment of cells with sanguinarine,
cells were collected by trypsinization, counted and replated equal number of cells at low density (3,000 cells)
in triplicate in six-well tissue culture plates (TPP). The
cells were allowed to grow for 14 days followed by
staining with crystal violet. Images of cell colonies were
procured using a digital scanner.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Apoptosis was measured using a VybrantTM
apoptosis assay kit (Molecular Probes) as per as
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa2 cells (105) were seeded in 6-well plates and next day,
treated with 1.0 and 2.0 μM of sanguinarine for 24 h.
After treatment, cells were trypsinized and resuspended
in Annexin V binding buffer followed by incubation with
Annexin V-FITC for 15 min at 4°C in the dark. Cells were
further stained with 5 μl of PI for another 5 min at 4°C in
the dark. Apoptotic cells were analyzed immediately on a
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with the CellQuest 3.0
software system.

Cell culture and treatments
BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic
cancer cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (Corning Cellgro) supple­
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Cells
were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5%
CO2 at 37°C. BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were
authenticated at University of Wisconsin, Translational
Research Initiatives in Pathology laboratory (TRIP
Lab) by STR Analysis. This was done using the
Promega PowerPlex 16 HS System kit (DC2101),
which analyzes 15 STR loci and one sex determinant.
Before experimentation, these cells were tested for
mycoplasma using the Mycoplasma Detection Kit
(Lonza) according to manufacturer’s protocol, with
fluorescence readings done on a Synergy H1 Multimode
microplate reader (BioTek). Sanguinarine (≥98%
purity) was purchased from Sigma. Stock concentration
of sanguinarine (5 mM) was made in ethanol. The cells
were treated with sanguinarine as described later.
Ethanol alone treatment served as the control.

Sample preparation and LC/MS/MS analysis
For quantitative proteomics analysis, BxPC-3 cells
were treated with vehicle or sanguinarine (1 μM) for 24 h.
The treatments were done in duplicate and the experiment
was repeated three times to yield a total of 6 replicates
(3 biological replicates X 2 technical replicates). Treated
cells were collected by trypsin digestion followed by
centrifugation and washing with PBS to obtain cell pellets,
which were stored at −80°C for nano-LC/MS/MS.
Protein preparation and nano-LC/MS/MS
were performed at School of Pharmacy Analytical
Instrumentation Center Mass Spectrometry facility. A
schematic representation of the process is provided in
Figure 1A. Briefly, proteins were extracted from the
frozen cell pellets after addition of 0.3 ml ice cold PBS by
passing them through a 23 gauge needle 10–15 times. Cell
lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 g for
10 min at 4°C. Protein concentration of the extracts was
then determined by Micro BCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific/
Pierce). Sample protein (20 μg) was digested with 1 μg
sequencing grade trypsin (Promega Corp.). Following
an overnight digestion, samples were prepared for LC/
MS/MS by C18 Zip-Tip purification according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore Inc.). Samples were
then suspended in water with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) and
subjected to nano-LC/MS/MS.
For LC/MS/MS, the samples were analyzed by
injecting 1 μg of the digest onto a reverse phase BEH
C18 column (100 μm x 100 mm), with 1.7 μm, 300 Å

MTT, trypan blue exclusion- and clonogenic
cell survival assays
The effect of sanguinarine on cell proliferation
against BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were
analyzed using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly,
10,000 cells were seeded in 96-well plate, next day
treated with sanguinarine (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0
and 8.0 μM; for 24 and 48 h), followed by incubation
with MTT reagent for 2 h. MTT formazan crystals were
dissolved in DMSO and optical density was measured at
570 nm on a Synergy H1 Multimode microplate reader
(BioTek). The effect of sanguinarine treatments on the
growth and viability of BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells
was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion assay. Briefly,

nanoACQUITY chromatography system. Peptides were
eluted from the column using a 180 min increasing
organic gradient. Solvent A was water/0.1% formic acid
(v/v), while solvent B was acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid

gradient increased to 95% B and held for 10 min. At
160 min the gradient returned to 3% to re-equilibrate
the column for the next injection. Peptides eluting from
the column were analyzed by data-dependent MS/MS
on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.). A top 15 method was used to
acquire data. The instrument settings were as follows:
the resolution was set to 70,000, the AGC target was set
to 106 counts, the scan range was from 300–2000 m/z,
the MS scan was recorded in profile while the MS/MS
was recorded in centroid mode, dynamic exclusion was
set to 25 seconds.

and canonical pathways were generated using inputs of
gene identifiers, log2 fold-changes and p-values between
control and treated group comparisons.

Real-time PCR analysis
Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction in real time (qRT-PCR) was used for validation
modulated proteins at the transcription level. QIAshreder
and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) were used to isolate
total RNA from the cells following treatments, as per
the manufacturer’s protocol. The first strand cDNA was
transcribed with random primers, dNTPs and M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Promega). qRT-PCR was performed
using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems/Life Technologies Corp.) and SYBR Premix
Ex Taq II (TaKaRa) with first strand cDNA, forward
and reverse primers. Primers for STK33, HSPA1L,
FAM160A2, AP3B1, UACA, PDLIM4, ZCCHC14,
GPS1, DIP2C, DUSP4, CUL5, KCNS2, IL33, PCNA and
GAPDH were selected from the PrimerBank database
[37]. HIF1α primers used are described elsewhere [38].
All the primer sequences used in this study are listed in
Supplementary Table 2. The PCR program was set as:
initial denaturation step (95°C for 30 s) followed by DNA
amplification (95°C for 3 s followed by 61°C for 30 s)
for 40 cycle. Melt curve analysis was performed to ensure
the specificity of target amplicon. A housekeeping gene,
GAPDH was used for normalization and ∆∆CT algorithm
was used for relative quantification of target amplicons.

Data processing and protein identification by
human database search
Following LC/MS/MS acquisition, the data
were searched against the Swiss-Prot human proteome
database with decoy using Sequest HT search engine
under the Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.). Proteins were identified at a false
discovery cut off < 1%. Following protein identification
the LC/MS/MS data were aligned using Chromalign
software. Quantitation of peptides eluted between 30
and 130 min were performed on the processed data
using SIEVE 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The
protein list (as detailed in Supplementary Table 1)
were generated with set p-value 0.05 for the identified
proteins. Data were filtered to remove all proteins
identified by only a single peptide (no one-hit wonders).
Additional filtering of the data was done to remove
peptides with a coefficient of variance (CV) > 30% in
the 6 replicates.

Immunoblot analysis
A subset of proteins identified in LC/MS/MS
analysis (DUSP4, HIF1α and PCNA) and proteins related
with apoptosis (PARP and Caspase 7) were selected
for further validation by immunoblot analysis. Briefly,
following treatments, cells were collected and lysed
in 1X RIPA buffer (EMD Millipore Corp.) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc.) and 1 mM PMSF (Amresco LLC). The protein
concentration was determined by the BCA Protein
Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). For immunoblot
analysis, 40 μg proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE,
transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane, and
incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% milk). 1X TBST
buffer was used for blot washing as well as to make
5% milk. The membranes were probed with DUSP4
(Abnova Corporation), HIF1α, PCNA and Caspase 7
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), PARP and β–actin (Cell

secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
antibodies. The proteins were detected by enhanced
