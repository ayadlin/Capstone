ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancer-related causes of death
in the world. Recently, downregulation of microRNA-497 (miR-497) has been
observed in CRC tissues. In this study, we found that miR-497 expression levels were
downregulated in human CRC specimens compared to the adjacent normal tissues.
MiR-497 expression levels were strongly correlated with clinical stages and lymph
node metastases. Furthermore, kinase suppressor of ras 1 (KSR1), a known oncogene,
was a direct target of miR-497, and KSR1 expression levels were inversely correlated
with miR-497 expression levels in human CRC specimens. Overexpression of miR497 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and increased chemosensitivity
to 5-ﬂuorouracil treatment, whereas forced expression of KSR1 had the opposite
effect. Taken together, these results revealed that lower miR-497 levels in human
CRC tissues induce KSR1 expression which is associated with CRC cancer occurrence,
advanced stages, metastasis and chemoresistance. Lower miR-497 levels may be a
potential biomarker for CRC advanced stages and treatment response.

initiation and progression remain largely unknown. Better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
carcinogenesis, progression and drug resistance in CRC
would be helpful in improving diagnosis, therapy and
prevention.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as negative regulators for mRNA
expression via sequence-complementary targeting of the
3′-untranslated and other regions (3′-UTRs) to repress
translation or mediate mRNA degradation [9]. Due to
their abundance and divergence of targeting speciﬁcity,
it is believed that one single miRNA can interact with
multiple mRNA targets to achieve regulatory control over
virtually many biological processes [10, 11]. A variety of

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent
carcinomas throughout the world, with an estimated one
million new cases and half million mortalities each year
[1, 2]. The 5-year overall survival rate ranges from 40%
to 60% [3, 4]. The advances of diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches have greatly improved long-term survival of
CRC, but a signiﬁcant proportion of patients still develop
into drug resistance, relapse and poor outcomes [5–7]. At
the molecular level, colorectal cancer arises from a series
of genetic and epigenetic alterations that may inactivate
tumor suppressor genes or/and activate oncogenes
[8]. However, the basic mechanisms underlying CRC

MiR-497 inhibits cell proliferation, migration
and invasion of CRC cells

studies have reported that miRNAs play critical roles in
cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis
and they can potentially act as both oncogenes and
tumor-suppressor genes in a variety of tumors including
colorectal cancer [12, 13]. Among them, miR-497 has
been demonstrated to function as a tumor suppressor.
Loss of miR-497 expression has been reported in many
cancer types, whereas restoration of miR-497 expression
has been shown to abrogate tumorigenesis [14–16]. To
date, some genes have been identiﬁed as miR-497 target
genes, including IGF-IR, eIF4E, SMURF1, Bcl2 and
cyclin E1 [14, 17–20], which are involved in pathogenesis
of cancers. However, the role and molecular mechanism
of downregulated miR-497 in CRC has not been fully
determined.
In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-497
levels were downregulated in human CRC tumor specimens
using 62 pairs of normal and cancer tissues. Then, we
will investigate: (1) what is the role of miR-497 in CRC
cell growth, migration and invasion; (2) what is speciﬁc
direct target of miR-497 that is associated with cancer
development; and (3) whether forced miR-497 expression
inhibits cell growth, migration and invasion via this direct
target; (4) whether miR-497 and its target are responsible
for the resistance to 5-ﬂuorouracil treatment in CRC.
These results will provide new insights into the molecular
mechanism of CRC development and provide potential new
therapeutic strategy for CRC treatment in the future.

To examine the role of miR-497 during
carcinogenesis of human CRC, SW1116 cells with
low expression levels of miR-497 were infected with
lentivirus expressing miR-497 or negative control. After
the selection by puromycin, stable cell lines termed as
SW1116/miR-497 and SW1116/miR-NC were established.
Taqman RT-PCR analysis demonstrated miR-497 was
highly expressed in SW1116/miR-497 cells, conﬁrming
that stable cell line over-expressing miR-497 was
successfully established (Figure 2A).
To further study the role of miRNA-497 in
regulating cell proliferation, migration and invasion, we
found that cell growth and migration were attenuated in
SW1116/miR-497 cells compared with SW1116/miR-NC
cells (Figures 2B and 2C). Furthermore, SW1116/miR497 cells showed signiﬁcantly lower invasion activity
compared to SW1116/miR-NC (Figure 2D). Thus, our
results show that miR-497 is responsible for suppressing
cell proliferation, migration and invasion, similarly as a
tumor suppressor in CRC cells.

KSR1 is a direct target of miR-497, and CRC
tissues have higher KSR1 levels that are inversely
correlated with miR-497 expression levels
To fully understand mechanism of miR-497 in
inhibiting human CRC development, TargetScan search
program was used to predict targets of miR-497. KSR1
was one of the putative targets of miR-497 (Figure 3A).
To explore whether miR-497 targets KSR1 by binding
to its 3′-UTR region, SW1116 cells were co-transfected
with the wild type (WT) or mutant (Mut) KSR1 luciferase
reporter in the presence of miR-497 or miR-NC. After 24
h, the luciferase activities in these cells were measured. As
shown in Figure 3B, luciferase activities were signiﬁcantly
reduced in the cells transfected with the wild type KSR1
reporter, but not in the cells with the mutant reporter
(Figure 3B). In addition, forced expression of miR-497
attenuated KSR1 protein expression and ERK activation, a
known downstream molecule (Figure 3C), suggesting that
miR-497 directly targets KSR1 by binding its seed region
of the 3′-UTR region in human CRC cells.
Furthermore, we measured levels of KSR1 in
human CRC specimens and adjacent normal tissues.
The results showed that the average expression levels
of KSR1 were signiﬁcantly higher in tumor tissues
than those in the normal tissues (Figure 3D). Next, we
determine the correlation between KSR1 levels and miR497 expression levels in the same human CRC specimens
using Spearman’s rank correlation analysis. As shown
in Figure 3E, expression levels of KSR1 and miR-497
were inversely correlated in 62 human CRC specimens
(Spearman’s correlation r=-0.6407).

RESULTS
MiR-497 is down-regulated in human CRC
specimens
To determine the expression levels of miR-497
in human CRC specimens, RT-qPCR analysis was
performed in 62 pairs of tumor specimens and matched
adjacent normal tissues. The results showed that miR497 expression levels in tumor tissues were signiﬁcantly
lower than those in adjacent normal ones (Figure 1A).
To compare miR-497 expression levels among different
clinical stages, we found that its expression levels in
tumor tissues were correlated with the clinical stages of
CRC patients. The expression levels of miR-497 in high
grade tumors (WHO Grades III-IV) were signiﬁcantly
downregulated compared with those in low grade tumors
(WHO Grade I and II) (Figure 1B and Table 1). In addition,
miR-497 levels were markedly lower in the patients with
lymph node metastases than those in the patients without
lymph node metastases (Figure 1C and Table 1), which
was consistent with the above result, since lymph node
metastases commonly occurs in high grade tumors. Taken
together, low expression levels of miR-497 in tumor
tissues were closely related with advanced clinical stages
and metastases, indicating that miR-497 levels may be a
potential new biomarker for the diagnosis of CRC.

Restoration of KSR1 reverses miR-497suppressed cell proliferation, migration and
invasion

MiR-497 renders CRC cells more sensitive to
5-ﬂuorouracil treatment by targeting KSR1
Resistance to 5-ﬂuorouracil treatment is one of the
major causes for the failure of chemotherapy in treating
human CRC. Therefore, it is critical to discover new
strategies to increase 5-ﬂuorouracil effect for therapeutic
purposes. Our results showed that overexpression
of miR-497 in SW1116 cells signiﬁcantly increased
chemosensitivity to 5-ﬂuorouracil treatment (Figure
5A). Furthermore, cell growth rate in the presence of
5-ﬂuorouracil was assayed using CCK-8 proliferation assay
at different time points, we found that forced expression of
KSR1 resulted in more resistance to 5-ﬂuorouracil treatment
in miR-497-overexpressing CRC cells (Figure 5B). To
further test whether miR-497 and its target KSR1 play a

To test whether KSR1 overexpression reverses
miR-497-inhibiting cell proliferation, migration and
invasion, SW1116 cells were transfected with KSR1
cDNA without its 3′-UTR region. As shown in Figure 4A,
forced expression of KSR1 rescued miR-497-suppressed
KSR1 expression and ERK activation, conﬁrming the
effect of KSR1 cDNA expression. As we expected, forced
expression of KSR1 also restored miR-497-inhibited cell
proliferation, migration and invasion (Figures 4B–4D),
suggesting that miR-497 suppresses human CRC cell
proliferation, migration and invasion by inhibiting its
target KSR1.

role in cellular apoptosis in the presence of 5-ﬂuorouracil
treatment, FACS analysis and caspase-3 assay were
performed. The combination of miR-497 and 5-ﬂuorouracil
treatment signiﬁcantly induced cellular apoptosis, whereas
forced expression of KSR1 partially abolished the apoptotic
effect induced by the combination of miR-497 and
5-ﬂuorouracil treatments (Figure 5C). Moreover, we found
that compared with miR-497 or 5-ﬂuorouracil treatment
alone, the activities of caspase-3, a key executor of cell
apoptosis, were signiﬁcantly upregulated upon combination
treatment of miR-497 and 5-ﬂuorouracil, whereas forced
expression of KSR1 attenuated the activation of caspase-3
during the treatment (Figure 5D). These results indicate that
miR-497 renders CRC cells more sensitive to 5-ﬂuorouracil
treatment for inducing apoptosis through targeting KSR1.

results suggest that miR-497 inhibits tumor growth and
angiogenesis with decreased KSR1 expression in vivo.

DISCUSSION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a novel class of regulatory
molecules, have been frequently indicated to be
dysregulated in diverse human cancers [21]. miRNAs have
been documented to function as both tumor suppressor
genes and oncogenes in regulating many cellular events.
Recent studies have reported that miR-497 functions as
a tumor suppressor in several kinds of cancers [14–20].
In this study, we found that miR-497 expression was
downregulated in CRC tumor samples compared with
adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of miR-497
inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and
increased chemosensitivity to 5-ﬂuorouracil treatment.
KSR1 is a molecular scaffold for the Raf/MEK/ERK
phosphorylation cascade [22–24]. KSR1 binds to Raf,
MEK, and ERK to positively induce ERK activation [22–
27]. KSR1 has been widely denoted as a pseudokinase,
owing to the fact that there is controversy regarding
whether its kinase domain is active. However, emerging
evidence suggests that KSR1 has dual functions as both an
active kinase and a scaffolding protein, adding complexity
to the simple view of MAPKs spatiotemporal pathway
control [28, 29]. Recent studies have reported that KSR1
affects cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation
through inducing ERK activation [22]. In our study, KSR1
oncogene has been experimentally validated as a novel
direct target of miR-497 not only in vitro, but also in vivo.
Furthermore, we also show that miR-497 acts as a tumor
suppressor to inhibit cell growth, migration, invasion, and
to diminish MAPK/ERK signaling pathway via targeting
KSR. Our study highlights a key role of miR-497 in
inhibiting CRC tumorigenesis.
Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (e.g.,
5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU), S-1) has been the cornerstone

MiR-497 suppresses tumorigenesis in vivo
In order to test whether miR-497 inhibits tumor
growth and angiogenesis of CRC in vivo, SW1116/miR497 or SW1116/miR-NC cells were injected into both
posterior ﬂanks of immunodeﬁcient mice, and tumor sizes
were started to be measured after 2 weeks of injection.
Compared to miR-497 group, miR-NC group developed
signiﬁcantly larger tumors from Day 20 to Day 29 (Figure
6A). MiR-497 overexpression signiﬁcantly suppressed
tumor growth since the tumors trimmed out from miR497 overexpressing group showed smaller size and lower
tumor weight (Figures 6B and 6C). Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining revealed that expression levels of CD31
and the quantitative microvascular density (MVD) were
signiﬁcantly decreased by miR-497 overexpression in
tumor tissues (Figure 6D), demonstrating that miR497 inhibits angiogenesis in xenografts. Consistent
with in vitro data, levels of KSR1 and p-ERK1/2 in
tumor tissues from miR-497 overexpression group were
much lower than those of miR-NC group analyzed by
immunoblotting assay (Figure 6E). Taken together, these

Extensive efforts in the past have contributed to
better understanding of both molecular and cellular
mechanisms of 5-ﬂuorouracil action, one of the most
important pyrimidine antagonists [30]. Recent studies
have focused on the involvement of microRNA (miRNA)
in cancer chemoresistance. miRNAs are differentially
expressed in chemosensitive and chemoresistant cells
[31, 32]. Several studies have suggested that miRNAs
are novel players in the development of chemoresistance.
Our recent study showed that microRNA-143 inhibits
tumor growth and angiogenesis and sensitizes

chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin in colorectal cancers
[33]. Overexpression of miR-22 reverses paclitaxelinduced chemoresistance through activation of PTEN
signaling in p53-mutated colon cancer cells [34]. In
this study, we found that forced expression of miR497 increased the effect of 5-ﬂuorouracil in inducing
cellular apoptosis, indicating that miR-497 restoration
may offer a new option to overcome chemoresistance to
5-ﬂuorouracil treatment in CRC.
In summary, we have identiﬁed that KSR1 is a novel
target of miR-497. MiR-497 acts as a tumor suppressor
to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor

were dissected. Total proteins were extracted and used for
immunoblotting. Tumors were formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded, sectioned at 5μm, then immunohistochemically
stained using CD31 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
under similar procedure as previously described [36].

Statistical analysis

Dual-luciferase reporter assay

All experiments were performed three times, and
data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5(La Jolla, CA,
USA). The correlations between miR-497 expression
levels and clinical pathologic features in human CRC
specimens were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test for
2 groups and by Kruskall-Wallis test for 3 groups. The
correlations between miR-497 expression levels and
KSR1 levels in human CRC tissues were analyzed using
Spearman’s rank test. Statistical evaluation for data
analysis was determined by t-test. The differences were
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

For dual-luciferase assay, 3′-UTR regions of KSR1
containing predicted miR-497 seed-matching sites and
corresponding mutant sites were ampliﬁed by PCR using
human cDNA template, and inserted into the SacI and
HindIII restriction enzyme sites by pMIR-REPORTER
vector (Ambion, CA, USA). These constructs were
validated by DNA sequencing. SW1116 cells were seeded
in a 24-well plate and co-transfected with the wild type
or mutant reporter plasmid, pRL-TK plasmid, and miR497 or miR-NC. Luciferase activities in the cells were
analyzed 24 h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega, WI, USA). Experiments
were performed in three independent replicates.

Cancer cells were seeded at a density of 4,000 cells
per well in a 96-well plate overnight. Freshly prepared
5-ﬂuorouracil solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) was added into medium to obtain ﬁnal culture
concentrations ranging from 1 to 32 μM. Cell viability was
assayed using CCK8 kit 48 h later.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Apoptosis assay

The authors declare that they have no conﬂict of
interest.

Apoptosis was measured by ﬂow cytometry as
previously described [35]. For AnnexinV staining, 5 μL
phycoerythrin-Annexin V, 5 μL propidium iodide (BD
Pharmingen) and 400 μL 1× binding buffer were added
to the cell samples, and incubated for 15 min at room
temperature in the dark. Then the samples were analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences)
within 1 h. The data were analyzed using FlowJo software.
Three experiments were performed in triplicate.
