ABSTRACT
Preclinical evaluation of Retrocyclins (RC-100, RC-101) and Protegrin-1 (PG-1)
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is important because of their therapeutic potential
against bacterial, fungal and viral infections. Human mast cells (HMCs) play
important roles in host defense and wound healing but the abilities of retrocyclins
and protegrin-1 to harness these functions have not been investigated. Here, we
report that chemically synthesized RC-100 and PG-1 caused calcium mobilization
and degranulation in HMCs but these responses were not blocked by an inhibitor of
formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1), a known receptor for AMPs. However, RC-100
and PG-1 induced degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells stably
expressing Mas related G protein coupled receptor X2 (MrgX2). Chemical synthesis of
these AMPs is prohibitively expensive and post-synthesis modifications (cyclization,
disulfide bonds, folding) are inadequate for optimal antimicrobial activity. Indeed,
we found that synthetic RC-100, which caused mast cell degranulation via MrgX2,
did not display any antimicrobial activity. Green-fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged
RC-101 (analog of RC-100) and GFP-tagged PG-1 purified from transgenic plant
chloroplasts killed bacteria and induced mast cell degranulation. Furthermore, GFPPG1 bound specifically to RBL-2H3 cells expressing MrgX2. These findings suggest
that retrocyclins and protegrins activate HMCs independently of FPRL1 but via MrgX2.
Harnessing this novel feature of AMPs to activate mast cell’s host defense/wound
healing properties in addition to their antimicrobial activities expands their clinical
potential. Low cost production of AMPs in plants should facilitate their advancement
to the clinic overcoming major hurdles in current production systems.

INTRODUCTION

as the cathelicidin LL-37 and human β-defensins (hBDs)
have the potential to be utilized as antimicrobial agents
[2-4]. In addition to their direct antimicrobial activity, LL37 and hBDs display immunomodulatory properties which
include the recruitment and activation of immune cells
such as mast cells, neutrophils, monocytes and T cells [59]. These AMPs also modulate angiogenesis and promote
wound healing [10-12]. In addition, many AMPs cause
red blood cell lysis and display cytotoxic activity against
immune and non-immune cells [13, 14]. Great strides have

Antibiotics have been used for treatment of
microbial infections since the early 1900s but emergence
of multidrug resistant strains of microbes poses a
tremendous public health concern globally [1]. Thus,
there is an urgent need to develop novel therapy for the
treatment of infectious diseases caused by antibiotic
resistant organisms. Cationic antimicrobial peptides

After establishing the in vitro efficacy of RC-101 against
various pathogens, formulated peptide has been shown to
be efficacious in several primate and human ex vivo tissue
culture models [22, 30]. RC-101 is also effective in vivo
when applied as a topical microbicide on vaginal tissue
in a pigtailed macaque model [31]. The preclinical safety
shown by this AMP has made it a promising candidate to
move ahead with safety trials in humans. In the case of
PG-1, Iseganan a synthetic analogue of protegrin has been
developed as an oral mouthwash against opportunistic
pathogens and has already been tested in several Phase
II and Phase III clinical trials [32-34]. Before further
trials are carried out, it is important to mechanistically
understand the impact of AMPs on non-target cells,
especially immunomodulatory cells in addition to their
effect on microbes.
Mast cells are multifunctional immune cells found
in all mammalian vascularized tissues, most commonly
at sites exposed to the external environment, such as the
skin, oral mucosa, airway and intestine. Not surprisingly,
mast cells play a sentinel role in host defense, orchestrate
innate immunity and promote wound healing [35-44].
Mas-related G protein coupled receptor-X2 (MrgX2) was
originally identified as a novel G protein coupled receptor
(GPCR) that is expressed in the dorsal root ganglia and
participates in the perception of pain [45]. Outside the
dorsal root ganglia, the expression of this receptor is
restricted to human mast cells and no other immune or
structural cells [46, 47]. We have recently shown that the
AMPs such as human β-defensins and the cathelicidin
LL-37 activate human mast cells via MrgX2 to induce
G protein-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and robust mast
cell degranulation [6, 7]. Unlike MrgX2, FPRL1 (also
known as FPR2), a member of the chemokine GPCRs,
is expressed in a variety of cells including mast cells,
neutrophils, macrophages and ovarian cancer cells [8, 48,
49]. Mast cells are the only immune cells that are known
to express both MrgX2 and FPRL1. Furthermore, AMPs
such as hBD3 and LL-37 activate human mast cells via
MrgX2 but pleurocidin does so via FPRL1 [6, 7, 50].
These findings raise the interesting possibility that RC100/RC-101 and PG-1 could activate human mast cells via
MrgX2 or FPRL1, thereby contributing to their therapeutic
potentials as antimicrobial agents.
With the exception of our recent reports on human
defensins, none of the AMPs in clinical development have
been investigated for their role in immune modulation
via mast cell activation. Here, we report that two
AMPs (retrocyclin and protegrin) currently in clinical
development activate human mast cells via a mechanism
different from human HDPs (independent of FPRL1) but
through the same receptor (MrgX2). Our studies also
demonstrate a dissociation of synthetic RC-100’s ability
to activate mast cells from its antimicrobial activity and
could reflect the peptide’s cyclization status. Unlike most
GPCRs that are expressed in mast cells, MrgX2 is located

been made in recent years in identifying and optimizing
AMPs for lower toxicity with greater stability/activity,
which can also harness the immune system for therapeutic
benefits [15, 16].
A family of AMPs known as θ-defensins is found
in leukocytes of rhesus macaques [17]. These cyclic
octadecapeptides are stabilized by three disulfide bonds,
display antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral activities
and are thought to play an important role in host
defense in primates [18]. Although mRNA transcripts
for θ-defensins are found in humans, corresponding
peptides are not expressed due to a premature stop
codon which prevents their translation [19]. It has been
proposed that this mutation and the resulting absence
of θ-defensins may render humans more susceptible to
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection than
rhesus macaques [20]. Retrocyclin-1 (RC-100) is a
cyclic octadecapeptide humanized θ-defensin, which
was initially prepared by solid phase synthesis [19]. It
has broad spectrum antimicrobial properties and protects
human target cells from HIV-infection in vitro [19]. This
protective effect does not involve direct inactivation of
the virus but reflects high affinity binding to gp120 and
galactosylceramide [21]. An analog of RC-100 containing
a single arginine to lysine substitution (RC-101) has
greater antimicrobial and anti-HIV effects [22]. Unlike
hBD3 and LL-37, retrocyclins are non-hemolytic and noncytotoxic but whether they activate immune cells has not
yet been determined [23].
Protegrin-1 (PG-1) is an antimicrobial peptide that
was originally isolated from porcine leukocytes [24]. It
shares many structural similarities with θ-defensin; it
is a cysteine rich octadecapeptide with high arginine
content but lacks a cyclic backbone [18]. The antiparallel β-hairpin conformation of PG-1 is stabilized by
two cysteine-cysteine disulfide bonds and contributes
substantially to their antimicrobial activity [24-27]. Due
to the unique structure and broad-spectrum antimicrobial
activities, retrocyclins and PG-1 have immense therapeutic
potential against infectious diseases. A major limitation
of chemically synthesized peptides is that they are
prohibitively expensive (~$600,000 - $700,000/gram).
In addition, post-synthesis modifications (cyclization,
disulfide bonds and folding) are less than adequate for
their optimal antimicrobial activity. Most commercial
sources of retrocyclin have no antimicrobial activity due
to inadequate cyclization. To overcome these limitations,
we have expressed RC-101 and PG-1 in transgenic
tobacco chloroplasts as GFP-fusion proteins. Both these
AMPs are folded properly with suitable posttranslational
modifications (cyclization and disulfide bonds) and have
potent antimicrobial activity against bacterial and viral
pathogens [28].
Currently around 500 - 600 AMP drugs are in
clinical trials as a result of their high efficacy, pathogenic
specificity and safety shown in in vitro experiments [29].

at both plasma membrane and intracellular sites [6, 47]
but the relative contribution of these receptors on mast
cell activation is unknown. The availability of chloroplast
expressed GFP-tagged PG-1 allowed us to demonstrate
that activation of cell surface MrgX2 by this AMP is
sufficient to cause mast cell degranulation. Increased
understanding of AMPs’ mechanism of action, their
interaction with non-target cells and low cost production
should facilitate further clinical development.

µg/ml (Figure 1A). Because increase in intracellular Ca2+
mobilization provides an important signal for mast cell
degranulation, we sought to determine the effect of PG-1
on this response. We found that PG-1 (3 µg/ml), which
caused ~60% mast cell degranulation, was associated with
a sustained Ca2+ response (Figure 1B). To determine the
relationship between mast cell activation and antimicrobial
activity, we tested the effects of different concentrations
of PG-1 on bacterial growth. As shown in Figure 1A and
1C, PG-1 caused mast cell degranulation and inhibited
bacterial growth at a similar concentration range (2 -5 µg/
ml).
RC-100 also induced degranulation and Ca2+
mobilization in human mast cells and it was more potent
than PG-1 (Figure 1D and 1E). Thus, while PG-1 (1 µg/
ml) did not induce mast cells degranulation, RC-100 at
this concentration induced a significant response. Despite
this difference, both peptides induced a similar maximal
response (~80% degranulation) at a concentration of 5 µg/
ml. Surprisingly, RC-100 did not prevent bacterial growth
even at a high concentration (5 µg/ml) (Figure 1F), which
induced substantial mast cell degranulation (Figure 1D).

RESULTS
PG-1 and RC-100 induce degranulation in HMCs
but RC-100 does not have antimicrobial activity
We used laboratory of allergic diseases 2 (LAD2)
cells to determine the effects of PG-1 and RC-100 on mast
cell signaling and degranulation. We found that PG-1 (2
µg/ml) induced significant degranulation and a maximal
response of ~80% was observed at a concentration of 5

Roles of G proteins on PG-1 and RC-100-induced
Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation in human
mast cells

PG-1 and RC-100 mediated degranulation in
HMCs does not involve FPRL1
The cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37
activates human neutrophils and monocytes via the
utilization of FPRL1 [8]. Human mast cells also express
FPRL1 and the cationic AMP pleurocidin induces mast
cell via this receptor [50]. Furthermore, a selective
FPRL1 antagonist peptide, WRW4 blocks pleurocidininduced mast cell degranulation [50]. To determine the
possible role of FPRL1 on PG-1 and RC-100-induced
responses in HMCs, we utilized WRW4. We found that
pretreatment of cells with WRW4 had no effect on PG-1
and RC-100 induced Ca2+ mobilization (Figure 3A-3D)
or degranulation (Figure 3E). These findings suggest that
FPRL1 does not participate in RC-100 or PG-induced
mast cell responses.

Next, we sought to determine the involvement of
G proteins on mast cell responses to PG-1 and RC-100.
Pertussis toxin (PTx), an inhibitor of Gαi-family of G
protein, is known to block the complement component
C3a-induced Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation in
human mast cells [51, 52]. While PTx completely blocked
C3a-induced Ca2+ mobilization it had little or no effect on
the responses elicited by either PG-1 or RC-100 (Figure
2A, 2B, 2D and 2E). Notably, treatment of cells with
PTx almost completely blocked degranulation induced
by PG-1 and RC-100 (Figure 2C and 2F). These findings
demonstrate that PG-1 and RC-100 cause degranulation in
human mast cells via the interaction of a Gαi-independent
Ca2+ influx and an unknown Gαi-dependent signaling
pathway.

PG-1 and RC-100 activate human mast cells via
MrgX2

Expression and purification of GFP-tagged RC101 and PG-1 from transgenic plants

Considering the recent demonstration that MrgX2
acts as the receptor for a range of cationic peptides
including AMPs [6, 7, 46, 53], we hypothesized that PG-1
and RC-100 could activate HMCs via this receptor. RBL2H3 cell is a rat basophilic leukemia cell line that has been
extensively used to study the role of IgE receptor (FcεRI)
and GPCR signaling in mast cells [51, 54, 55]. We have
recently shown that RBL-2H3 cells are unresponsive to
human AMPs unless the cells are transfected with cDNA
encoding MrgX2 [56]. To determine the role of MrgX2
on PG-1 and RC-100-induced degranulation, we utilized
RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing human MrgX2. In this
system, PG-1 and RC-100 induced substantial mast cell
degranulation (Figure 4A and 4B). Taken together, these
data demonstrate that PG-1, RC-100 activate mast cells
via MrgX2.

To determine the expression levels of GFP-RC101
and GFP-PG1 in transgenic plants, plant extracts were
quantified by western blotting using anti-GFP antibody
(Figure 5A). Expression level of GFP-RC101 was between
20 - 34% and GFP-PG1 was 4 - 8% of total leaf protein.
One gram of fresh leaf yielded about 100 µg of GFP
protein on an average with an overall recovery of 20%
and 95% purity. Figure 5B shows the purified GFP-RC101
obtained after dialysis, lyophilization and reconstitution
in a small volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
quantified by immunoblotting against GFP. GFP-RC101
(29 kDa) purified protein has a slightly higher molecular
weight than GFP standard (27 kDa) due to RC101 fusion
(1.9 kDa). The purity of such preparations was about 90%
when evaluated through immunoblot analysis. To evaluate
purity and functionality of GFP-RC101, the purified
proteins were run under non-denaturing conditions in a
native PAGE. Figure 5C shows purified GFP-RC101
exhibiting increasing fluorescence intensity corresponding
to the amount of total protein loaded, confirming GFP

GFP-RC101 and differential electrical mobility due to

the high positive charge present on RC101 and secondary
structures.

GFP-RC101 and GFP-PG1 isolated from plant
chloroplast display antimicrobial activity and
cause mast cell degranulation via MrgX2

is challenging because of their antimicrobial activity.
Therefore, in this study, we compared both chemically
synthesized and recombinant GFP-tagged peptides
expressed in chloroplasts and evaluated their antimicrobial
and immunomodulatory properties. Chloroplasts are
prokaryotic compartments within eukaryotic cells with
exceptional ability to synthesize foreign proteins from
different kingdoms including bacterial [57] viral [58]
fungal [59], animal [60] and human genes [61-65].
Because of expression of >10,000 copies of transgenes
in each plant cell, foreign proteins are expressed at very
high levels (up to 70% of total leaf protein). Expressed
recombinant proteins can be indefinitely stored at ambient
temperature in lyophilized cells maintaining their efficacy
and functionality [66, 67], thereby eliminating expensive
cold storage/transportation and short shelf life. These
are highly desired features for affordable production and
delivery of human therapeutic proteins in the clinic.
Most importantly, chloroplasts perform all posttranslational modifications required for fully functional
antimicrobial peptides including folding, stabilization
with disulfide bond and cyclization. Several studies have
shown that human blood proteins (like insulin, interferon,
etc), when expressed in chloroplasts are properly folded
with disulfide bonds and are fully functional upon oral or
injectable delivery [68, 69]. Chloroplasts also assemble
complex multimeric structures (like cholera toxin B) with
disulfide bonds that bind to epithelial cell receptors like
GM1 (General Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside) [60,
61, 64, 70-73]. Assembly of virus-like particles that are
required for stability and efficacy of vaccine antigens has
been observed in chloroplasts [74, 75]. Protein disulfide
isomerase/thioredoxin expression has been shown to
enhance folding and assembly of human serum albumin
within chloroplasts, a complex protein requiring 17
disulfide bonds [76]. Cyclization with disulfide bonds
is required for antimicrobial activity of retrocyclin and
chloroplasts synthesize and fold such cyclic proteins [28].
Functional evaluation of both protegrin and retrocyclin
synthesized in chloroplasts, in this study, again confirms
proper folding and formation of disulfide bonds.
Human mast cells express FPRL1 and MrgX2
and these GPCRs are activated by different AMPs [6,
7, 50]. We found that a potent and selective inhibitor of
FPRL1 had no effect on RC-100 or PG-1-induced Ca2+
mobilization and degranulation. Furthermore, expression
of MrgX2 in a rodent mast cell line RBL-2H3 cells, which
do not endogenously express this receptor, rendered
these cells responsive to both RC-100 and PG-1 for
degranulation. These findings demonstrate that RC-100
and PG-1 bind to MrgX2 receptor to induce signaling
and degranulation in human mast cells. It is noteworthy
that in unstimulated mast cells, MrgX2 is located at both
plasma membrane and intracellular sites [6, 47]. There is
now growing body of evidence for the role of both plasma
membrane and intracellular GPCRs for sustained signaling

To determine antimicrobial activity of chloroplastderived GFP-RC101 and GFP-PG1, we tested their effects
on growth of E. coli. As shown in Figure 6A, both peptides
completely inhibited growth of E. coli. To determine their
effects on mast cell degranulation, we incubated LAD2
mast cells with GFP-RC101 (1.8 µg/ml) and GFP-PG1
(2.4 µg/ml). We found that GFP-PG1 and GFP-RC101
cause significant degranulation of human mast cells
(Figure 6B) and such responses were equivalent to those
elicited by chemically synthesized commercial peptides
(Figure 1A and 1D).
An important property of MrgX2 that distinguishes
it from other GPCRs in mast cells is that this receptor is
located at both plasma membrane and intracellular sites [6,
47]. This raises an interesting possibility that PG-1 or RC101 could activate mast cells via their interaction with cell
surface or intracellular receptors. To test this possibility,
we exposed mock or MrgX2-transfected RBL-2H3 cells
to GFP alone or GFP-PG1 for 30 min and observed GFP
fluorescence in mast cells by confocal microscopy. As
shown in Figure 7A, GFP-PG1 did not associate with
mock-transfected RBL-2H3 cells. In contrast, GFP-PG1
was associated with the plasma membrane of MrgX2expressing cells but not GFP alone without PG1 fusion
(Figure 7B). These findings suggest that GFP-PG1 induces
mast cell degranulation via the activation of MrgX2
receptors that are present on the cell surface.

DISCUSSION
Retrocyclins and protegrins are cyclic or acyclic
peptides with potent antimicrobial activities against a
broad spectrum of microorganisms, including bacteria,
fungi, yeast. They also bind to glycoprotein 120 to prevent
HIV entry. These peptides therefore have potential for
use as anti-microbial and anti-HIV agents. Many AMPs
not only display antimicrobial activity but they also have
immunomodulatory and wound healing properties that
can be harnessed for their therapeutic activity. However,
to the best of our knowledge, the effects of retrocyclins
and protegrins on the activation of immune cells such as
mast cells have never been tested.
An important limitation of studies with these
peptides is the tremendously high cost of their chemical
synthesis ($600,000 - $700,000/gram). In addition, postsynthesis modifications (cyclization, disulfide bonds and
folding) are less than adequate for optimal antimicrobial
activity. Thus, most commercial source of retrocyclin has
no or negligible antimicrobial activity due to inadequate
cyclization or other post-translational modifications.

and effector function [77]. Substance P, which couples to
MrgX2, has been shown to activate intracellular G proteins
to induce mast cell degranulation [46, 78]. This raises
the interesting possibility that AMPs used in this study
could induce mast cell degranulation via the activation of
intracellular MrgX2. The availability of GFP-PG1 allowed
us to test this possibility. The findings that GFP-PG1
interacted with RBL-2H3 transiently expressing MrgX2
but not mock transfected cells clearly demonstrated a
specific ligand-receptor interaction. We found that the
interaction of GFP-PG1 with MrgX2-expressing RBL2H3 cells was localized to the plasma membrane and no
green fluorescence was detected at intracellular sites even
after prolonged incubation. This finding demonstrates that
GFP-PG1 interacts with cell surface MrgX2 on mast cells
to induce signaling and degranulation.
One important finding of the present study is that
while the synthetic RC-100 activated mast cells via
MrgX2, it had no detectable antimicrobial activity. The
data sheet from the manufacturer indicated that the peptide
is >95% pure and has the appropriate molecular mass but
did not provide evidence for antimicrobial activity. It has
previously been shown that while structures and stabilities
of retrocyclins depend on the number and position of the
disulfide bonds, their antimicrobial and membrane binding
properties depend on the presence of cyclic backbone
[21]. Our previous studies have shown that both linear
and cyclic cationic peptides including substance P, hBD3
and LL-37 activate human mast cells via MrgX2 [6, 7,
56]. Thus, it is likely that the cationic residues on AMPs
such as hBD3, LL-37, retrocyclins and protegrins interact
with negatively charged residues on MrgX2 to induce
mast cell activation but their ability to cause microbial
killing requires additional posttranslational modifications
(cyclization, disulfide bonds, folding). These findings
suggest that different structural determinants on AMPs
dictate their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory
properties. Thus, new molecules can be designed in the
future to modulate their different functions.
Unlike circulating leukocytes, mast cells are tissue
resident cells that are found beneath the epithelium and
close to blood vessels. The epithelium expresses pattern
recognition receptors (e.g. toll-like receptors), which
responds to infectious agents to generate AMPs [79,
80]. These cationic peptides kill microbes by binding
to negatively charged residues on their membrane [81].
Mast cell degranulation plays an important role in innate
immunity by causing increased vascular permeability and
by initiating the recruitment of neutrophil to the sites of
infection [36-39, 43, 44]. We have previously shown that
hBD3, which is derived from epithelial cells, activates
human mast cell via MrgX2 [7]. Furthermore, hBD3
increases vascular permeability in a mast cell-dependent
manner [82]. These findings suggest that MrgX2 expressed
in mast cells contributes to innate immunity via its effects
on vascular permeability and neutrophil recruitment.

In addition to innate immunity, mast cells
orchestrate the development of adaptive immunity and
play an important role in wound healing [35, 40-42]. Thus,
at sites of microbial infection, mediators released from
mast cells promote migration of dendritic cells, which
are subsequently increased in draining lymph nodes [8385]. Furthermore, mast cell-derived histamine directly
modulates dendritic cell activation to enhance antigen
presentation to T cells [86]. Interestingly, compound
48/80, which activates mast cells via MrgX2, has been
used as a safe and effective vaccine adjuvant in mice [42,
46, 87]. Wound healing is a dynamic process that involves
a number of overlapping phases including inflammation,
granulation tissue formation, wound contraction and
remodeling. Wound provides an excellent breeding
ground for microbes and proper healing is dependent on
managing the microbial burden. Interestingly, LL-37 and
hBD3, which display antimicrobial activity and cause
mast cell degranulation via MrgX2, also promote wound
healing [6, 11, 12, 88]. It is noteworthy that mast cells
are only immune cells that express MrgX2 and the data
presented herein demonstrate that retrocyclins and PG-1
activate mast cells via this receptor. These findings suggest
that potential therapeutic benefits of retrocyclin/PG-1 and
other AMPs in vivo not only reflects their antimicrobial
activity but also involves the harnessing of mast cell’s
immunomodulatory and wound healing properties.
In conclusion, biopharmaceuticals produced in
current systems are prohibitively expensive and are not
affordable for a large majority of the global population.
Chemically synthesized AMPs used in this study cost
$600,000 - $700,000 per gram and their post-synthesis
modifications (cyclization, disulfide bonds, folding) are
inadequate for optimal antimicrobial activity (retrocyclin
100 has no detectable antimicrobial activity). Therefore,
in this report we synthesized fully functional AMPs in
plant chloroplasts, making them affordable for the large
global population who often face outbreak of infectious
diseases. Enhancing our understanding of mechanistic
aspects of AMPs is important for clinical development.
With the exception of our recent reports on human HDPs,
none of the AMPs in clinical development have been
investigated for their role in immune modulation via mast
cell activation. Here, we report the novel finding that two
AMPs (retrocyclin and protegrin) currently in clinical
development as antimicrobial agents activate human mast
cells via MrgX2. Using AMPs with GFP fusion expressed
in plant chloroplasts we demonstrate that activation
of cell surface receptor is sufficient to cause mast cell
degranulation without involvement of the intracellular
receptor. Increased understanding of AMPs mechanism of
action, their interaction with non-target cells and low cost
production should facilitate further clinical development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

1 mM p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine for 1.5
h at 37oC. Reaction was stopped by adding 250 μl of a
0.1 M Na2CO3/0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer and absorbance was
measured at 405 nm [90].

All cell culture reagents and pertussis toxin were
purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). Amaxa
transfection kit (Kit V) (Lonza, Gaithersburg, MD),
recombinant human cytokines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill,
NJ), C3a (Complement Technology, Tyler, TX), RC100 (VWR Bachem, Louisville, KY) and Protegrin 1
(Anaspec, Freemont, CA) were purchased from the
sources indicated.

Biomass production and immunoblot analysis of
AMPs from transgenic plants
Seeds from transplastomic plants expressing
GFP-RC101 and GFP-PG1 [28] were germinated on
Murashige and Skoog medium containing 500 mg/l
spectinomycin. After confirmation of GFP fluorescence,
transgenic plants expressing AMPs were transferred to
pots in the greenhouse for growth under controlled light,
temperature and moisture. Because the psbA sequence
used for the transgene expression is regulated by light
mature leaves were harvested at 6 PM for maximizing
protein accumulation. To determine GFP protein
expression levels Bradford assay was performed on plant
extracts and purified proteins to find the total soluble
protein (TSP) concentration. Based on this, appropriate
dilutions were made and mixed with 5X sample buffer.
The GFP standard and samples were boiled for 3 minutes
and loaded onto a 1.0 mm thick 12% SDS-PAGE gel
for electrophoresis. The separated proteins were then
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane at 85V for 45
min. The nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked
with PTM (1X PBS, 0.05% Tween-20, 3% Milk) for 1 h
at room temperature. Mouse anti-GFP primary antibody
(EMD Millipore, cat# MAB 3836, 1:3,000) was added in
PTM and incubated overnight at 4°C. The membrane was
washed 3 times with PBS-T (1X PBS, 0.05% Tween-20),
10 min each time. Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
(Southern Biotech, cat# 1031-05, 1:4,000) was added
in PTM and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.
Membrane was developed using SuperSignal West Pico
chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, cat#
34079).

Culture of mast cell lines
LAD2 human mast cells were maintained in
complete StemPro-34 medium supplemented with 100 ng/
ml hSCF [89]. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells
were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% FBS, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 IU/ml)
and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) [90].

Transfection of RBL-2H3
RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with plasmids
encoding hemeagglutinin (HA)-tagged MrgX2 using the
Amaxa nucleofector device and Amaxa kit V according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Following transfection, cells
were cultured in the presence of G-418 (1 mg/ml) and
cells expressing equivalent receptors were sorted using
an anti-HA specific antibody 12CA5/FITC-conjugated
anti-mouse-IgG and subsequently used for studies on
degranulation and confocal microscopy.

Calcium mobilization
Ca2+ mobilization was determined as described
previously [90]. Briefly, LAD2 cells (0.2 x 106) were
loaded with indo-1 AM (1 μM) for 30 min at room
temperature. Cells were washed and resuspended in 1.5
ml of HEPES-buffered saline. Ca2+ mobilization was
measured in a Hitachi F-2500 spectrophotometer with
an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission
wavelength of 410 nm.

Purification of AMPs from plants
The GFP-PG1, GFP-RC101 and control GFP
peptides were purified as described previously [28]. One
gram of finely ground frozen leaf material was suspended
in 5 ml of protein extraction buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10
mM EDTA, 200 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 0.2% [v/v] Triton
X-100, 400 mM sucrose, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 1X solution of Pierce protease inhibitor cocktail).
Vortexed samples were sonicated and centrifuged at
2500 x g for 5 min. The lysate was then subjected to the
organic extraction protocol described by Skosyrev et al
[91]. Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added to
the cleared lysate so that the final lysate contained 70%
ammonium sulfate [v/v]. The precipitated proteins were
then extracted into 100% ethanol by adding 1/4th and 1/16th

Degranulation
LAD2 cells (5 × 103) and RBL-2H3 cells (5 × 104)
were seeded into 96-well plates in a total volume of 50 μl
HEPES buffer containing 0.1% BSA and exposed to the
indicated peptides. In some assays cells were pretreated
with pertussis toxin (PTx, 100 ng/ml, 16 h). For total
β-hexosaminidase release, unstimulated cells were
lysed in 50 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100. Aliquots (20 μl) of
supernatant or cell lysate were incubated with 20 μl of

of the volume of the lysate/ammonium sulfate mixture
(aqueous phase) followed by shaking for 2 min and
centrifugation at 2500 x g for 5 min. The ethanol extracts
were pooled and to 1/3rd volume of this ethanol phase 5M
NaCl was added to make a final concentration of 1.6 M.
The aqueous phase was collected and salt was removed
using a desalting column (Thermo Scientific, Zeba spin
column, 7 kDa MWCO). The desalted aqueous phase was
loaded onto the Butyl-Toyopearl Hydrophobic Interaction
Column (TOSOH Butyl-650S resin, Grade S resin, particle
size 65 µm, Column Volume 48 ml) pre-equilibrated with
20% ammonium sulfate in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM
EDTA pH 7.8. Subsequently, the column was washed
with 3 column volume (CV) of the equilibration buffer
and 2 CV with 10% step wise reduction in ammonium
sulfate. Proteins were eluted with salt free elution buffer
containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA pH 7.8. The
proteins were then dialyzed three times in dialysis buffer
containing 1 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM Tris-HCl, and 10 µM
EDTA, pH 8.0. Dialyzed proteins were shell frozen in a
freezing bath and lyophilized. The purified proteins were
then reconstituted in a small volume of reconstitution
buffer (PBS, 10% glycerol).

Antimicrobial assay

Fluorescence gel and fluorescence intensity
readings

Mock and MrgX2-transfected RBL-2H3 cells were
grown on coverslips and maintained in fresh complete
media. Cells were incubated with control GFP and
PG1-GFP (4 µg/ml) for 30 min in 50 μl HEPES buffer
containing 0.1% BSA, washed with ice cold PBS and
then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Confocal
microscopy was performed on a Nikon A1R laser scanning
confocal microscope with a 60x water objective (NA 1.2),
using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter with the emission
wavelength of 488 nm. Images were analyzed using
Nikons Elements 4.1 software.

Antimicrobial assay was adapted from the
microbroth dilution assay described by Steinberg and
Lehrer [92]. An overnight culture of E coli grown in
tryptic soy broth (TSB) was diluted to 1:20 in the same
media and OD600 was measured using the Nanodrop
2000C spectrophotometer. From the measured OD value
the bacterial concentration in terms of colony forming
units (CFU)/ml was calculated based on the formula
provided below.
A bacterial density of 4x105 CFU/ml was used as
the starting inoculum. Bacterial suspension (250 µl) was
grown in the presence of AMPs at the indicated final
concentrations on a shaker (VWR Benchtop Shaking
Incubator, Model 1570) at 240 RPM and 37°C. The
growth curves of these cultures were followed for 8 h by
measuring OD600 at 2 h intervals. At the end of 8 h the
cultures were diluted and plated on LB agar to determine
CFU the next day.

Confocal microscopy

Total soluble protein (TSP) concentration was
determined by the Bradford assay, and different quantities
of protein were loaded with non-denaturing sample buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.04% Bromophenol
blue, 10% glycerol) into a 12% native polyacrylamide
gel. After electrophoresis, gels were observed under
UV light for GFP fluorescence. Images were taken and
analyzed with Image J software. For fluorescence intensity
calculations, the Gemini EM microplate reader was
used and calculations were done with the Softmax Pro
software (Molecular Devices). Standard GFP (Millipore,
cat# 14-392) was used to calculate GFP concentrations
in samples based on the fluorescence intensity. Samples
and GFP standards (standard curve range from 31.25 ng
to 500 ng) were dissolved in 200 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0 and fluorescence intensities were measured by
exciting the samples at 400 nm and measuring emission
at 510 nm using a 96-well optical bottom plate. For
Commassie staining gels were soaked in fixing solution
(40% ethanol, 10% acetic acid in Milli Q water) for 20
min at room temperature on a shaker. Subsequently, the
gel was stained overnight in colloidal Coomassie G-250
stain (35% methanol, 2.5% phosphoric acid and 10%
ammonium sulfate in Milli Q water) and destained first by
rinsing with water three times followed 10% acetic acid.
