Abstract
Cancer stem–like cells (CSC) have been proposed to promote
cancer progression by initiating tumor growth at distant sites,
suggesting that stem-like cell features can support metastatic
efﬁciency. Here, we demonstrate that oncogenic DNp73, a
dominant-negative variant of the tumor-suppressor p73, confers cancer cells with enhanced stem-like properties. DNp73
overexpression in noninvasive melanoma and lung cancer cells
increased anchorage-independent growth and elevated the
expression of the pluripotency factors CD133, Nanog, and
Oct4. Conversely, DNp73 depletion in metastatic cells downregulated stemness genes, attenuated sphere formation and
reduced the tumor-initiating capability of spheroids in tumor

xenograft models. Mechanistic investigations indicated that
DNp73 acted by attenuating expression of miR-885-5p, a
direct regulator of the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) responsible for
stemness marker expression. Modulating this pathway was
sufﬁcient to enhance chemosensitivity, overcoming DNp73mediated drug resistance. Clinically, we established a correlation between low p73 function and high IGF1R/CD133/
Nanog/Oct4 levels in melanoma specimens that associated
with reduced patient survival. Our work shows how DNp73
promotes cancer stem–like features and provides a mechanistic
rationale to target the DNp73–IGF1R cascade as a therapeutic
strategy to eradicate CSC. Cancer Res; 76(2); 197–205. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

mesenchymal properties involves interference with wild-type
TAp73-dependent transactivation of LIMA1/EPLIN that consecutively fosters activation of the IGF1R-AKT-Slug signaling and
downregulation of E-cadherin.
Regardless of the function in DNp73-induced EMT and cancer
aggressiveness, IGF1R signaling was implicated in several biologic
processes essential for malignancy, including cell growth, DNA
repair, and survival. Emerging evidence also support an involvement of the IGF1-receptor in differentiation events. IGF1R expression levels are enriched in human embryonic and hematopoietic
stem cell populations. Regulated by mutant D40p53, IGF1R
maintains pluripotency by blocking differentiation of embryonic
stem cells into somatic cells (5). A direct link between activated
IGF1R signaling and the gain of stem cell– and EMT-associated
properties was recently discovered in lung cancer stem cells,
demonstrating a profound role for ﬁbulin 3-suppressed IGF1R/
PI3K/AKT/GSK3b signaling in the regulation of mesenchymal and
stem cell markers (6). Cancer stem–like cells (CSC) are a rare
subpopulation of undifferentiated cells within a tumor that are
proposed to be the cancer-initiating cells responsible for tumorigenesis, tumor relapse, and metastasis. In particular, CSCs exhibit
characteristics of tumor cells that have undergone EMT, and
contribute to DNA damage protection. In consistence with the
activation of IGF1R by DNp73 and the role of IGF1R signaling in
mediating EMT, chemoresistance, and stemness, we hypothesize
an involvement of DNp73 in the acquisition of stem cell features
to promote therapeutic resistance and cancer cell propagation.

N-terminal truncated variants of the tumor-suppressor TP73,
collectively termed DNp73, are of pivotal importance in the
modulation of gene expression to confer a malignant phenotype
and drive tumor progression. Lacking the TA domain by differential splicing events at the 50 -end or usage of an alternative
intrinsic promoter, DNp73 isoforms are unable to directly transactivate target gene expression. DNp73 thereby counteracts
tumor-suppressive properties of wild-type p53/TAp73 through
forming inactive heteromeric complexes with them or by occupying p53-responsive elements on gene promoters. High-expression levels of DNp73 are observed especially in late-stage tumors
and metastases, where they signiﬁcantly correlate with poor
patient outcome (1). Numerous studies have provided substantial evidence that DNp73 bestows chemoresistance by decreasing
intracellular drug accumulation through upregulation of the ABC
transporters A2, A5, and B1 (2, 3). Moreover, we recently demonstrated that the DNp73 variant DEx2/3p73 causes dramatic
increases in cancer malignancy via promoting the transition from
an epithelial to a highly motile mesenchymal (EMT) phenotype,
leading to increased invasiveness and metastases formation in
xenograft mouse models (4). DNp73-mediated acquisition of

1,407/1,414 bp and 1,833/1,839 bp (30 UTR-1) or 6,965/6,971 bp
(30 UTR-2) were cloned downstream of the luciferase gene into the
pEZX-MT01 vector (GeneCopoeia) via SpeI and HindIII restriction
sites. Primer pairs used for cloning were listed in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. Luciferase activity was measured 40 hours
after transfection using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega) and normalized to total protein concentration in cell
extracts.
RNA and miR extraction, qRT-PCR, and TaqMan array
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and
miR extraction was performed with the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems). For qRT-PCR RNA was reverse
transcribed with the Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA
samples were mixed with iQTM SYBR Green Supermix and
analyzed on iQTM5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Relative gene expression was calculated using
iQTM5 Optical System Software. Ct values were normalized
with the housekeeping gene b-actin. Primer pairs used for PCR
were listed in Supplementary Materials and Methods. MiR-8855p expression was measured using TaqMan MicroRNA assays
and 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System purchased from
Applied Biosystems. Speciﬁc microRNA primers were used for
the detection of hsa-miR-885 (hsa-miR-885-5p 002296) and
hsa-miRNA-RNU6B purchased from Applied Biosystems. Relative miR expression was calculated by the comparative Ct

Colony formation assays were conducted by seeding cells on
0.6% agarose at 1  104 cells per well in 6-cm plates. After 4 weeks

198 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

of culturing, colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted.
Self-renewal assay was performed by seeding 2  103 cells on 24well plates in DMEM/F12 (PAA) containing N-supplements
(Invitrogen), 20 mg/mL insulin (Sigma), 10 ng/mL FGF2 (Cell
Systems), 10 ng/mL EGF (Sigma), 10 mg/mL penicillin (PAN
Biotech), and 100 U/mL streptomycin (PAN Biotech). After 10
days, tumor spheres were photographed and counted.
Flow-cytometry analysis
Apoptotic cells were quantiﬁed after infection and treatment
with genotoxic cisplatin (cDDP, 70 mmol/L) or doxorubicin
(DXR, 1 mmol/L) for 48 hours as described previously (2, 4).
Animal studies
Athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice were s.c. injected into the ﬂank
with 103, 104, 105 adherent melanoma cells or spheres suspended
in Matrigel 1:3 (BD Biosciences). Impact of DNp73 on tumor
initiation was detected by injecting ASO.116- or ASO.scr-pretreated SK-Mel-147 tumor spheres. Tumor volume was measured
using calipers. All animal procedures were conducted in adherence to ethical standards and with approval of the local Animal
Care Committee.
Statistical analysis
Statistical evaluation was performed by the Student unpaired t
test. Overall survival curves were calculated by SigmaPlot (Systat
Software) according to the Kaplan–Meier method using the logrank test. Melanoma cancer patients were grouped according to
low TAp73 and high IGF1R/CD133/Oct4/Nanog mRNA levels
based on an expression signature generated by using the cancer
browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu). All statistical tests
used in this study were two sided. A value P of <.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results and Discussion
DNp73 confers stem-like properties to melanoma and lung
cancer cells
Considering higher levels of p73DEx2/3b (hereinafter referred
as DNp73) in metastatic than nonmetastatic melanoma cell lines
(4), we ﬁrst attempted to investigate the impact of this variant on
the expression of classical well-characterized stem cell surface
markers and stemness-related genes, which are involved in preservation of the stemness status, in noninvasive SK-Mel-29 cells
that stably express DNp73. Compared with parental SK-Mel-29,
DNp73 considerably enhanced Nanog, Oct4, and CD133 mRNA
levels, whereas endogenous levels of CD44, Sox2, and Klf4
remained unaffected (Fig. 1A, left). Evaluating the ability of these
cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner characteristic
for tumor and stem cells, we observed a raised number of colonies
in SK-Mel-29.DNp73 cells after 4 weeks of culture in soft agar (Fig.
1A, right). To further assess the potential of DNp73 in modulating
stem cell features, we used several human melanoma cell lines
with a strong correlation between endogenous DNp73 and their
invasive/metastatic potential (4). Ectopic expression of DNp73 in
noninvasive SK-Mel-28 and -888 cells, harboring low endogenous
DNp73, upregulated Nanog, Oct4, and CD133 without altering
CD44, Sox2, and Klf4 levels (Fig. 1B). Consistently, treatment of
highly DNp73-expressing metastatic SK-Mel-147, C8161,
A375M, and WM793 with ASO.116 to speciﬁcally block DNp73
(7) reduced endogenous Nanog, Oct4, and CD133 compared

with control (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S1A). Unexpectedly,
depletion of DNp73 in C8161 cells additionally showed a clear
inhibitory effect on CD44, Sox2, and Klf4. As C8161 are very
aggressive melanoma cells with even stronger invasive/metastatic
potential than A375M or WM793, differences of DNp73-regulated stem cell markers may be due to their molecular background.
Comparability analysis in C8161 and A375M cells showed a
marked reduction of c-Fos and increased collagenolytic activity
as well as c-Jun and c-Myc overexpression in C8161 (8). In light of
impaired transcriptional activity of TAp73 through direct interaction with c-Myc and the recently demonstrated role of c-Myc in
promoting stemness by increasing Nanog, Oct4, and EpCam (9),
elevated DNp73 and c-Myc levels in advanced tumor stages might
potentiate transactivation of speciﬁc stem cell gene promoters. We
recently discovered somatic genomic rearrangements of TP73 that
create an oncogenic TP73DEx2/3 version in highly aggressive lung
cancer (10). According to the ﬁndings in malignant melanoma
cells, up- and downregulation of DNp73 in A549 and H1299 lung
carcinoma cell lines, which differ in their endogenous DNp73
level (11) and invasive capacities (Supplementary Fig. S1B) also
alters Nanog, Oct4, and CD133 expressions but not CD44, Sox2,
and Klf4 (Fig. 1B, right).
To elucidate whether DNp73 can stimulate CSC features, we
examined the ability of tumor cells to form spheres in serumfree media as a key criteria for self-renewal capacity. Spheroid
formation of SK-Mel-147, C8161, and H1299 cells with high
DNp73 expression was seen within 10 days, demonstrating that
they possess a signiﬁcant portion of CSCs, whereas SK-Mel-28,
-29, and -888 only form very few and small spheres (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The speciﬁc requirement of DNp73 in stem
cell maintenance was corroborated by treating highly malignant C8161 cells with ASO.116. Compared with control, inhibition of DNp73 signiﬁcantly reduced their efﬁciency to form
tumor spheres (Fig. 1C, top left). In addition, gene-expression
analysis in these cancer cell–derived spheres revealed a clear
enrichment of DNp73 in the sphere population with high
CD133 levels (Fig. 1C, top right) and increased expression of
stem cell markers (Fig. 1C, bottom), which shows that upregulation of DNp73 is associated with increased stem cell
characteristics. We also assessed the impact of DNp73 on the
cancer-initiating capacity of tumor spheres in mouse xenografts. Compared with C8161, spheres derived from these
melanoma cells exhibit a higher ability to initiate tumors upon
xenotransplantation (Fig. 1D, top). Selective ablation of
DNp73 by ASO.116 substantially suppresses initial growth of
CSC-derived tumors (Fig. 1D, middle and bottom, and Supplementary Fig. S1D), implying that DNp73 has a crucial
impact on tumor initiation and self-renewal activity of the
CSC subpopulation in cancer cells.
TAp73/miR-885-5p–mediated blockade of IGF1R is removed by
DNp73
On the basis of the activation of IGF1R signaling through
DNp73 to drive EMT (4) and the importance of IGF1R in selfrenewal of CSCs, we hypothesized that this receptor is also
involved in DNp73-associated acquisition of stem cell features.
To gain mechanistic insight into how p73 regulates IGF1R, we
performed TaqMan microarrays in SK-Mel-29 cells infected
with adenoviral vector–expressing TAp73 or GFP as control.
Using bioinformatic analysis tools such as microRNA.org and
TargetScan.org to search for TAp73-regulated miRNAs targeting

200 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

the IGF1-receptor, we identiﬁed miR-885-5p that was upregulated 10-fold by TAp73 and potentially inhibits IGF1R. Regulation of miR-885-5p expression due to TAp73 but not p53 was
veriﬁed in various melanoma and lung carcinoma cell lines
with TaqMan qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A).
For investigating the role of DNp73 in miR-885-5p regulation,
its p73-driven activation was analyzed in the presence of
ectopic DNp73. As shown in Fig. 2A (left) and Supplementary
Fig. S2B, TAp73-induced miR-885-5p expression is abolished
through DNp73. Furthermore, miR-885-5p whose expression
increases in DNp73-depleted cells in a dose-dependent manner, declines strongly upon DNp73 overexpression (Fig. 2A,
right; Supplementary Fig. S2C). Previous studies reported a
tumor-suppressive function of miR-885-5p in neuroblastoma
cells, demonstrating that this miRNA induces apoptosis and
senescence by targeting CDK2 and MCM5, and activating p53
signaling (12). Here, we provide evidence that p73-induced
miR-885-5p targets the IGF1-receptor. Stable expression of
miR-885-5p (Supplementary Fig. S3A) causes severely reduced
IGF1R transcript levels compared with cells expressing miR-scr
(Fig. 2B). To support direct suppression, we cloned 30 UTR
fragments of IGF1R mRNA containing the miR-885-5p–responsive elements at position 1407-1414, 1833-1839 (30 UTR-1),
and 6965-6971 (30 UTR-2) into reporter plasmid and examined
luciferase activity (Fig. 2C). Increasing amounts of miR-885-5p
clearly blocked reporter activity regulated by both 30 UTR
elements, demonstrating a strong inhibitory effect of miR885-5p on IGF1R expression.
Because of our recent data, which showed that DNp73 leads to
IGF1R and AKT activation in melanoma cells (4), we further
investigated whether IGF1R signaling is affected by miR-8855p. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2D, the levels of IGF1R,
P-IGF1R, and P-AKT are reduced upon ectopic TAp73, whereas
upregulated when DNp73 is overexpressed. TAp73-mediated
repression of IGF1R signaling was signiﬁcantly recovered by
inhibiting miR-885-5p (Fig. 2D, left). The only partial effect can
be explained by the incomplete inhibition of p73-induced miR885-5p through miRZip-885-5p (Fig. 2D, central). Accordingly,
high levels of miR-885-5p diminished endogenous IGF1R and
reduced phosphorylation of IGF1R and AKT (Fig. 2D, right).
Together, these results provide a molecular mechanism that is
responsible for inhibition of IGF1R by TAp73, and indicate that
DNp73 activates IGF1R signaling via suppression of the TAp73–
miR-885-5p axis.
IGF1R is the mediator of DNp73-driven stemness
Because activated IGF1R signaling is associated with enhanced
Nanog expression in embryonic stem cells (5), and in liver CSCs
both proteins were demonstrated to regulate each other in a
positive feedback loop (13), we examined whether DNp73 controls stem cell properties via the miR-885-5p-IGF1R cascade. Thus,
we analyzed expression levels of DNp73-induced stem cell markers in melanoma and lung cancer cells with ectopic miR-885-5p.
Compared with parental cells, stable miR-885-5p expression
(Supplementary Fig. S3) was correlated with decreased levels of
Nanog, Oct4, and CD133, and additionally in C8161 cells with
diminished CD44 but not SOX2 and KLF4 expression (Fig. 3A, left
and middle). Moreover, miR-885-5p overexpression reduced
sphere formation capacity of SK-Mel-147 (Fig. 3A, right). Vice
versa, miR-885-5p ablation could restore p73-mediated inhibition of Nanog, Oct4, and CD133 (Fig. 3B, left). Accordingly, the

treatment of stable SK-Mel-29.DNp73 or H1299 and SK-Mel147 cells harboring high endogenous DNp73 with IGF1R
inhibitor results in decreased Nanog, Oct4 and CD133
(Fig. 3C, middle). Intriguingly, in aggressive C8161 melanoma
cells where depletion of DNp73 also attenuates CD44, SOX2,
and Klf4 levels (Fig. 1B), inhibition of IGF1R autophosphorylation abrogates CD44 but not Klf4 and SOX2 expression (Fig.
3C, right), suggesting an IGF1R-dependent mechanism for
CD44 while Klf4 and SOX2 induction by DNp73 is apparently
independent of IGF1R signaling. The signiﬁcance of the discovered DNp73–miR-885-5p–IGF1R axis for the cancer stem
cell phenotype was conﬁrmed by the detection of low miR-8855p and high DNp73, IGF1R, CD133, Oct4, and Nanog levels in
C8161-derived tumor spheres in contrast with tumor cells (Fig.
3D, left and middle). In addition, analysis of TCGA RNA-seq
datasets revealed that low TAp73 and high IGF1R, Nanog, Oct4,
and CD133 levels signiﬁcantly correlate with poor survival of
melanoma patients (Fig. 3D, right).
Inactivation of TAp73 through CK2-mediated phosphorylation was recently demonstrated to enhance Nanog, Oct4, and
Sox2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(14). Our data indicate that interference of DNp73 with the
TAp73–miR-885-5p–IGF1R axis stimulates expression of
Nanog, Oct4, and CD133 in melanoma and lung cancer as
well as CD44 in highly aggressive C8161 cells. On the basis of
the ﬁndings that DNp73 directly contributes to increased Nanog
promoter activity in mouse ES cells, which is inhibited by
TAp73 and p53, and so far no binding of p73 to the Nanog
promoter has been detected (14, 15), activated IGF1R signaling
might be crucial for DNp73 to stimulate transactivation of stem
cell markers in a gain-of-function–dependent manner. In this
regard, Niemantsverdriet and colleagues (16) demonstrated
that enhanced TGFb signaling induces complex formation of
DNp73 with Smad3/4 on Smad-binding elements to transactivate TGFb-regulated target genes. Furthermore, DNp73 interacts
with the transcriptional repressor NF-Y, resulting in PDGFRB
promoter activation (17). Therefore, association of DNp73
with IGF1R signaling–related transcription factors like NF-kB,
LEF1, or hypoxia factors 1/2, which have potential binding
elements in the Nanog, Oct4, and CD133 promoter as predicted
with the Genomatix software might be relevant to cooperatively
enhance expression of these developmental genes independently of interfering with p53/p73-responsive elements.
Repression of miR-885-5p links DNp73-mediated stemness to
enhanced chemoresistance
Numerous studies have reported that cancer stem cells are
more resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs than
the non-stem cell population. Because high DNp73 levels are
associated with enhanced resistance against cytotoxic agents
(2, 11, 18), we analyzed the effect of miR-885-5p-IGF1R
signaling regulated by antagonistic TAp73/DNp73 on survival
of tumor cells upon DNA damage. Apoptosis induction by
treating H1299 and A549 lung cancer cells with cisplatin or
doxorubicin greatly raised TAp73 and miR-885-5p expression,
which was accompanied by downregulation of endogenous
IGF1R (Fig. 4A). Consistently, stable overexpression of miR885-5p increased the proportion of apoptotic cells upon drug
treatment (Fig. 4B), whereas depletion of miR-885-5p considerably reduced DXR-mediated cell death (Fig. 4C, left). Notably, evasion of highly malignant tumor cells from genotoxic

204 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

therapy conferred through oncogenic DNp73 can be ablated via
concomitant overexpression of miR-885-5p or treatment with
the IGF1R inhibitor (Fig. 4C, right), suggesting that DNp73
causes chemoresistance through interfering with TAp73-miR885-5p–mediated repression of IGF1R. Increased death after
depletion of the DNp73-IGF1R signaling was also observed in
melanoma-derived tumor spheres through treatment with
ASO116, IGF1R inhibitor, or by miR-885 overexpression (Fig.
4D). Likewise, suppression of IGF1R signaling abrogates
DNp73-driven survival in SK-Mel-147 spheres, indicating the
importance of the DNp73–IGF1R axis in driving drug insensitivity of melanoma spheres.
Induction of a mesenchymal phenotype and stemness is
implicated in cancer resistance to chemotherapy. We previously
reported that the DNp73 variant DEx2/3p73 promotes skin
cancer metastasis by triggering EMT, migration, and invasion of
malignant melanoma cells (2, 4, 19). The data displayed here
indicate that this isoform bestows cancer cells with stem cell–
like characteristics that additionally favors the aggressive phenotype. Our results deﬁne that activation of IGF1R signaling is
necessary for DNp73 to elevate expression of distinct stem cell
markers, and to impart cancer stemness and chemoresistance to
different melanoma and lung carcinoma cell lines. This is in
agreement with other studies where activated IGF1R is the
inducer of an increased population of CD133/Oct4–positive
geﬁtinib-resistant lung cancer stem cells under hypoxic conditions (20). Moreover, expression of IGF2 and IGF1R is elevated
in Nanog-positive stem cells derived from hepatocellular carcinoma (13). In this report, we provide ﬁrst evidence that
IGF1R is stimulated by interference of DNp73 with the
TAp73–miR-885-5p axis. Our data lead us to conclude that
TAp73-induced miR-885-5p targets the IGF1-receptor, resulting
in loss of stem cell traits and an increased responsiveness of
melanoma and lung cancer cells to genotoxic therapy. Conversely, upregulation of DNp73 during malignant progression
blocks this miR-88–mediated repression of IGF1R, which
enables cancer cells to adopt a mesenchymal phenotype with
enhanced migratory properties, to preserve stemness and to
escape anticancer drugs.
