ABSTRACT
New strategies to prevent and early detect the cardiotoxic effects of the
anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOXO) are required. MicroRNAs emerged as potential
diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic approaches in cardiovascular diseases. MiR34a has a role in cardiac dysfunction and ageing and is involved in several cellular
processes associated with DOXO cardiotoxicity. Our in vitro and in vivo results
indicated that after DOXO exposure the levels of miR-34a are enhanced in cardiac
cells, including Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CPCs). Since one of the determining event
responsible for the initiation and evolution of the DOXO toxicity arises at the level
of the CPC compartment, we evaluated if miR-34a pharmacological inhibition in
these cells ameliorates the detrimental aftermath of the drug. AntimiR-34a has
beneficial consequences on vitality, proliferation, apoptosis and senescence of
DOXO-treated rat CPC. These effects are mediated by an increase of prosurvival
miR-34a targets Bcl-2 and SIRT1, accompanied by a decrease of acetylated-p53
and p16INK4a. Importantly, miR-34a silencing also reduces the release of this miRNA
from DOXO-exposed rCPCs, decreasing its negative paracrine effects on other rat
cardiac cells. In conclusion, the silencing of miR-34a could represent a future
therapeutic option for cardioprotection in DOXO toxicity and at the same time, it
could be considered as a circulating biomarker for anthracycline-induced cardiac
damage.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been
recognized as fundamental regulators of cardiovascular
functions and diseases and currently there is a growing
interest in develop their potential as both biomarkers
and therapeutics for cardiovascular pathologies [3–7].
MiRNAs are small (~22 nucleotides), noncoding RNAs
that regulate gene expression, primarily inhibiting the
translation of a specific mRNA target into a functional
protein and/or promoting mRNA degradation [8].
They can also convey part of the biological activity of
conditioned media from cell culture and their presence in
body fluids supports their role in cell-to-cell information
transfer [5, 7].

INTRODUCTION
Anthracyclines, a class of chemotherapeutic drugs
widely used to treat several pediatric and adult tumors,
are among the leading causes of cardiotoxicity in
cancer survivors. The spectrum of short- and long-term
cardiotoxic effects induced by doxorubicin (DOXO), one
of the most effective anthracycline, ranges from subclinical
ventricular dysfunction to severe cardiomyopathy and
heart failure that may result in cardiac transplantation or
death [1, 2]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to early
diagnose DOXO-induced toxicity and prevent future
ventricular complications.

MiR-34 family members (miR-34a, -34b, and -34c)
are upregulated in the heart in response to stress (i.e.
myocardial infarction) and contribute to the age-dependent
decline in cardiac function [9, 10]. In particular, miR-34a
the one predominantly expressed in the heart [10] modulates
several target proteins involved in cell cycle, apoptosis,
senescence, differentiation and cellular development
[11]. Pharmacological inhibition of miR-34a improves
cardiac regeneration and function in experimental models
of myocardial infarction and pressure overload-induced
hypertrophy [9, 10, 12], suggesting the silencing of this
miRNA as a future therapeutic option for cardioprotection.
Therefore, we evaluated whether miR-34a contributes to
the onset of DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity. In particular,
based on our previous studies that have demonstrated that
detrimental effects of DOXO on cardiac progenitor cells
(CPCs), negatively affect myocardial homeostasis [13, 14,
15], we investigated the possibility that miR-34a expression
is modified in rat CPCs (rCPCs) after DOXO exposure.
Additionally we address the possibility that modulation of
this miRNA could protect rCPCs from anthracycline toxicity.
Moreover, a recent study revealed an increased
expression of miR-34a in mouse heart as an early molecular

event of cardiac tissue injury during DOXO treatment [16].
Interestingly, miR-34a has been identified as a predictive
plasma marker of future heart failure in patients after acute
myocardial infarction [17]. These findings prompted us to
determine whether miR-34a could be a potential circulating
biomarker of DOXO-induced cardiac damage.

RESULTS
MiR-34a expression and release in DOXOtreated rat cardiac cells
To determine whether miR-34a take part to the
complex mechanisms involved in DOXO-induced
cardiotoxicity, its expression was evaluated in rat cardiac
cells. Rat CPCs, H9c2 cells, fibroblasts and RAOEC
(rat aortic endothelial cells) were exposed to 0.5 μM
DOXO for 24h. Real time PCR (qPCR) results showed
a significant upregulation of miR-34a in all cardiac cells
after DOXO treatment except for H9c2 (Figure 1A).
Nevertheless, miR-34a expression was significantly
increased in these cells after 48h of DOXO exposure
(Supplementary Figure 1). Moreover, to investigate

whether miR-34a could be released by cardiac cells,
the secretion of this miRNA in cell culture media was
evaluated. MiR-34a levels significantly increased only in
media from DOXO-treated rCPC and RAOEC but not in
H9c2 and fibroblast media (Figure 1B).

on known miRNA function, was used as control. MiR34a, both produced and secreted by rCPCs, was drastically
silenced by Ant34a, as well in the absence and presence of
DOXO (Figure 1C and 1D).

MiR-34a inhibition in DOXO-exposed rCPCs

AntimiR-34a effects on vitality and proliferation
of DOXO-treated rCPCs

The findings that the damage at the level of CPC
population is responsible of DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity
[13, 14, 15], prompted us to consider whether miR-34a
inhibition in rCPCs could provide therapeutic benefit to
DOXO toxicity. The cells were transfected with antimiR34a (Ant34a) 24h before DOXO administration and miR34a levels were measured by qPCR. Ant34a negative
control (AntCTL), a random sequence antimiR molecule
that has been validated to produce no identifiable effects

As expected the vitality and the proliferation of
AntCTL+DOXO rCPCs markedly decreased respect to
AntCTL treated cells (Figure 2A and 2B). Importantly,
miR-34a inhibition was able to reduce the cytotoxic effect
of DOXO. In fact, Ant34a treatment significantly increased
rCPC vitality and proliferation after DOXO exposure as
measured by MTT assay and the rate of BrdU incorporation
respectively (Figure 2A and 2B). In particular, in presence
of DOXO, miR-34a inhibition increased vitality by 29%

and the percentage of BrdU positive rCPCs raised more
than 2-fold with Ant34a+DOXO treatment with respect to
AntCTL+DOXO (Figure 2A and 2B).

[10, 12], and apoptosis is an essential process in DOXO
cardiotoxicity [19, 20], we next evaluated whether miR34a has a role in DOXO-induced apoptosis in rCPCs.
TdT assay showed that the number of apoptic cells were
markedly reduced by inhibition of miR-34a in DOXOtreated rCPCs (51% vs AntCTL+DOXO) (Figure 3A). To
assess if the protection from cell death is mediated by Bcl2, a target of miR-34a, the expression of this antiapoptic
protein was measured. Ant34a administration significantly
increased Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels in DOXO
rCPCs as validated by qPCR and western blot analysis
respectively (Figure 3B and 3C). In particular, Bcl-2
mRNA and protein levels in Ant34a+DOXO cells were
respectively almost 3-fold and 2-fold higher with respect
to AntCTL+DOXO.

AntimiR-34a effects on DOXO-treated cancer
cells
To determine whether miR-34a inhibition could
interfere with anthracycline antitumor activity, the effects
of increasing concentration of Ant34a were evaluated on
breast cancer cell line (MCF7) exposed to DOXO. In this
settings, 10 nM Ant34a treatment, that increased vitality
of DOXO-treated rCPCs (Figure 2A), did not influence
cytotoxic action of drug on tumor cells (Figure 2C).
However, the reduction of the cytotoxic effect of DOXO
in MCF7, was observed with a 10-fold higher Ant34a
concentration (Figure 2C).

Role of miR-34a in apoptosis of DOXO-exposed
rCPCs

SIRT1, one of several miR-34a targets, is a member
of the Sirtuin family of class III histone deacetylases,
which regulates cell cycle, cellular survival, senescence
and metabolism [21, 22]. It has been reported that SIRT1

As miR-34a has been shown to prompt apoptosis
in tumor cells [18] and recently also in cardiomyocytes

treated cells (Figure 6A). Nevertheless, with respect to
AntCTL+DOXO CM, the exposure to Ant34a+DOXO
CM caused a significant reduction of both apoptotic and
senescent H9c2 and endothelial cells, as demonstrated
by TdT and SA-β-galactosidase assays respectively
(Figure 6B and 6C). On the contrary, vitality, apoptosis
and senescence of cardiac fibroblasts were not influenced
by Ant34a+DOXO CM treatment (Figures 6A, 6B and
6C). These results indicated that miR-34a released by
DOXO-treated rCPCs can have negative consequences
also on other cardiac cells in a paracrine manner. Notably
pharmacological inhibition of miR-34a could revert these
effects.

plays an important regulatory role in the connection
between DNA damage, p53 and miR-34a [11]. P53 is
linked to miR-34a in a multifaceted manner and the
most common identified pathway is SIRT1, which
deacetylates its non-histonic substrate p53. Practically,
a positive feedback loop regulates p53-miR-34a-SIRT1
axis: p53 induces miR-34a and miR-34a activates p53 by
inhibiting the expression SIRT1 [11, 23]. As previously
demonstrated, DOXO induces acetylation of p53 in
human CPCs promoting cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or
senescence [24]. Therefore, we investigate whether miR34a inhibition could modulate SIRT1 and p53 expression
and function in DOXO-treated rCPCs. The 3’ untranslated
region (UTR) luciferase assay confirmed that SIRT1 is
a direct target of miR-34a. In fact, transfection of miR34a precursors clearly reduced luciferase activity for
the wild-type reporter but did not for the mutant types
SIRT1 3’UTR both at 24h (Figure 4A and 4B) and 48h
(Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B). Consistently, Ant34a
treatment upregulated the expression of both SIRT1
mRNA (62% vs AntCTL+DOXO) and protein (30% vs
AntCTL+DOXO) after DOXO exposure of rCPCs (Figure
4C and 4D). Moreover, in our experimental settings, miR34a inhibition decreased DOXO-induced p53 acetylation.
Both acetyl-p53Lys370 and acetyl-p53Lys381 were significantly
reduced subsequently to Ant34a treatment (Figure 4E and
4F), consistent with SIRT1 upregulation.

Evaluation of miR-34a levels in tissues and
plasma of rats affected by DOXO-induced
cardiomyopathy
Following the demonstration that in vitro miR-34a
secretion by rCPCs and endothelial cells is enhanced after
DOXO exposure, we evaluated if, also in vivo, DOXO
triggers the expression of miR-34a in heart tissue. MiR34a levels in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle were also
analysed. The well-established animal model of DOXOinduced cardiomyopathy was represented by F344 rats
treated with a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg DOXO [13,
24, 26]. At 3 weeks after the first injection of DOXO,
cardiac functions were measured by echocardiography and
then organs and blood samples were collected. DOXOtreated animals showed left ventricular dysfunction
respect to controls, in particular ejection fraction (EF) and
fractional shortening (FS) decreased by 10% and 20%
respectively (Figure 7A and 7B). qPCR results indicated
that DOXO administration upregulated miR-34a in heart,
liver, kidney, skeletal muscle (Figure 7C). However, in
DOXO-treated animals the heart contribution seems to
be predominant since, with respect to the other organs,
miR-34a levels were higher in cardiac tissue (Figure 7C).
Moreover, corroborating in vitro experiments, miR-34a
in situ hybridization in heart sections of DOXO-treated
animals showed higher levels of this miRNA in cardiac
cells, including c-kit positive rCPCs (Figure 7D and
7E). Importantly, plasma and exosome fraction from rats
affected by DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy were highly
enriched in miR-34a respect to control animals. MiR34a levels increased 4.7-fold in plasma and 3.5-fold in
exosome fraction, indicating that it is mainly released into
the blood within exosomes (Figure 7F). Therefore, cardiac
cells could release miR-34a in the peripheral circulation
and it could be potentially used as a marker of DOXOinduced cardiac damage.

AntimiR-34a effects on senescence of DOXOtreated rCPCs
The inactivation of p53, by SIRT1-mediated
deacetylation, may influence the process of cellular
senescence [25]. In rCPCs, DOXO induced an upregulation of p16INK4a and led to a massive cellular
senescence, confirming previously published results
[13, 14, 24]. However, with respect to AntCTL+DOXO,
Ant34a+DOXO treatment resulted in a significant
reduction in p16INK4a expression (37%) (Figure 5A).
These data were confirmed by a substantial decrease of
senescent cells (69% reduction vs AntCTL+DOXO),
as demonstrated by the reduced percentage of SA-βgalactosidase positive rCPCs (Figure 5B). Thus, miR34a inhibition could protect rCPCs from DOXO-induced
senescence.

Paracrine role of miR-34a on rat cardiac cells
Since in rCPCs DOXO stimulates also miR-34a
secretion, we investigated its possible paracrine effects on
other cardiac cell types. For this purpose, H9c2, fibroblasts
and RAOEC were grown for 48h in conditioned media
(CM) from AntCTL+DOXO- or Ant34a+DOXO-treated
rCPCs. In H9c2 and RAOEC, although cell vitality
was significantly reduced in all samples exposed to
DOXO CM, no significant variation was observed
between AntCTL+DOXO CM and Ant34a+DOXO CM

DOXO and its inhibition in rCPCs can partially prevent
the negative effects driven by DOXO not only in these
cells but also in neighboring ones. Second, in the light
of its increasing levels in heart and plasma of DOXOcardiomyopathic rats, miR-34a could be a potential
circulating biomarker of anthracycline induced cardiac
damage.
Cardiotoxicity remains the major side effect of
anthracycline, therefore the search for a strategy able to
counteract chemotherapy-induced cardiac complications
is extremely important, above all in view of the growing
population of cancer survivors. The involvement of
miRNAs, a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs,
in almost all processes underlying cardiovascular
disease raises the exciting possibility for the therapeutic
applications of these molecules [3, 6, 27].
In this paper, we have focused our attention on
miR-34a, a miRNA involved in several cellular processes
implicated in DOXO cardiotoxicity, such as apoptosis and
senescence [11] and recently recognized as a key regulator
in cardiac dysfunction and ageing [9, 10, 12, 17]. Our data
indicate that DOXO exposure upregulates, both in vitro
and in vivo, miR-34a expression in rat cardiac cells and
increases its release from rCPCs and endothelial cells,
supporting the hypothesis that this miRNA could be the
possible mediator of the negative consequences driven by

DOXO. Since previous studies have demonstrated that
resident CPCs are very sensitive to DOXO that severely
impairs their functions and regenerative capacity in
vitro and in vivo [13, 14, 24], influencing the subsequent
and progressive cardiac damage, we verified if miR34a pharmacological silencing in these cells prevents
anthracycline toxicity. In DOXO-treated rCPCs miR34a inhibition increased vitality and proliferation and
reduced apoptosis and senescence. Notably, miR-34a
released by DOXO-treated rCPCs has negative paracrine
consequences on other cardiac cells and its inhibition
could revert these effects. Different cardiac cells
including CPCs, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells,
have been demonstrated to secrete miRNAs, suggesting
a role of these small RNAs to act as paracrine signalling
mediators in several cardiovascular diseases [17, 28–30].
In this view, the silencing of a dysregulated miRNA may
represent a novel strategy, not only for modulating the
intracellular expression of the target miRNA but also for
reducing secreted miRNA, abrogating pathological cell-tocell communication.
To further assess the mechanisms which underlie
the above miR-34a mediated processes in DOXO toxicity,
we examined the expression of some direct or indirect
miR-34a targets, which have previously been linked
to cellular survival, apoptosis and senescence. Among

miR-34a direct targets, Bcl-2 and SIRT1 expression was
evaluated. Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein that promotes
cell survival in many organs, including the heart [31], is
implicated in DOXO-induced cardiac apoptosis [20] and
is downregulated in DOXO-exposed human CPCs [14].
SIRT1 plays an important role in the development and
progression of heart failure through the regulation of cell
death/survival-related signalling [32, 33] and numerous
evidence shows that molecules that activate SIRT1 are
cardioprotective in several models of cardiovascular
diseases, including DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity [24,
26, 34, 35]. Importantly, our recent study demonstrated
that SIRT1 activation by resveratrol protects DOXOexposed human CPCs and re-establishes their proper
functions [24]. Results of the present work show that the

prosurvival function of Bcl-2 and SIRT1, recovered by
Ant34a, are critical in DOXO-treated rCPCs. Additionally,
miR-34a induces cell senescence through the most
commonly accepted p53-miR34a-SIRT1 axis with a
positive feedback loop [36, 37]. Genotoxic stress activates
p53, the strongest inducer of miR-34a that inhibits
SIRT1 expression, which in turn inactivates p53 by its
deacetylation. Cellular senescence is the main process that
lead to functional failure of stem cells contributing to the
onset and progression of heart failure [13, 14, 24, 38–40].
Data of the present investigation indicate that miR-34a
pharmacological inhibition in DOXO exposed rCPCs
significantly reduce both p53-acetylated forms according
to SIRT1 increased levels. These molecular changes lead
to an important attenuation of DOXO-induced cellular

senescence as demonstrated by the reduction of p16INK4a
expression and SA-β-galactosidase activity. In conclusion,
DOXO-induced apoptosis and senescence in rCPCs can
be counteracted by miR-34a pharmacological repression.
These results shed light on the complex pathways that
underlie DOXO cardiac damage and propose miR34a inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for
anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.
As on one hand the intrinsic ability of miR-34a
to target different DOXO-related pathways makes its
inhibition an attractive therapeutic perspective, on the
other its clinical implications remain to be determined.
The potential candidates for such cardioprotective strategy
should be oncologic patients but antimiR treatment could
interfere with antitumor activity of DOXO. Nevertheless,
our results show that to reduce DOXO cytotoxic effect in
tumor cells, an effective concentration of Ant34a needs
to be 10-fold higher than the concentration that protects
rCPCs. So theoretically, its potential to prevent or reduce
anthracycline cardiotoxicity in oncologic patients should
not influence antitumor therapy. In the view of discording
studies that have reported a different role of miR-34a in
modulating tumor progression [23, 41, 42], it could be
suitable to address miR-34a inhibition exclusively to
the heart. At the same time, miR-34a is the first miRNA
entered into phase I clinical trials as emerging antitumor
approach (NCT01829971 clinicaltrials.gov). However,
taking into account our results, this therapy could
theoretically increase the risk of cardiovascular side
effects making necessary long-term studies.
Together with the need of an effective
cardioprotective approach for DOXO-induced toxicity,
the detection of earlier instrumental or biochemical
markers of cardiac injury able to predict heart failure is
of crucial importance. Recent evidences describe the
dysregulation of miRNAs across the heart upon DOXO
treatment [43–45] and importantly, miR-34a expression
has been found upregulated in the heart of DOXOcardiomyopathic mice [16]. In addition, miR-34a has
been identified as a predictive circulating marker of future
heart failure in patients after acute myocardial infarction
[17]. Interestingly, the present work reveals that rat cardiac
cells exposed to DOXO secrete increased levels of this
miRNA. Therefore, the hypothesis that miR-34a could
represent a possible circulating marker for DOXO-induced
cardiotoxicity has been explored. Our results indicated
that plasma of rats treated with DOXO is highly enriched
in miR-34a and, although anthracycline administration
upregulated miR-34a not only in the heart but also in
liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, the cardiac contribution
seems to be predominant. Moreover, it remains to verify
if cells from other organs could release miR-34a after
DOXO exposure thus concurring to secrete this miRNA
in plasma. We documented remarkably higher miR-34a
levels in plasma with respect to cardiac tissue of DOXOcardiomyopathic rats. This finding could be explained by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the extreme stability of circulating miRNAs that in our
settings are packaged in exosomes.
To our knowledge, it is the first time that a miRNA
is been recognized as a potential circulating biomarker
associated to DOXO-induced cardiac damage. Only
two studies had attempted to identify circulating miR208 as a marker for DOXO-cardiotoxicity in breast
cancer patients and in an animal model, but both failed
to demonstrate their intention [46, 47]. In our settings,
the animals were sacrificed one week after the last
injection of DOXO (3 weeks). This time represents an
early stage of the drug-induced cardiac damage, which
progresses in the long term. In fact, the abnormalities
in cardiac structure, myocyte performance and above
all the regenerative properties of stem cells population
found at 3 weeks after DOXO were markedly worsened
at 6 weeks, impairing ventricular hemodynamics and
affecting the animal survival as showed in the paper by
De Angelis [13]. Circulating miR-34a increases in the
animals treated with DOXO sacrificed at 3 weeks, but its
levels could be also higher during, at the end or also upon
DOXO administration. Therefore, the validity of miR-34a
as DOXO-associated biomarker should be assessed with
further studies to investigate how the time but also the
dose of DOXO could influence this parameter. Moreover,
clinical implications of miR-34a as biomarker of cardiac
toxicity consequent to anthracycline therapy in oncologic
patients should be carefully evaluated since its circulating
levels could be dysregulated in some types of tumors [23]
and its release could be also linked to tumor cell damage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Rat cardiac cells
rCPCs were isolated from 2-3 months old female
Fisher 344 rat hearts (Harlan Laboratories), slightly
modifying the protocol described by Smith AJ [48].
Briefly, hearts were rapidly dissected and washed in
Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with penicillin (100
U/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Euroclone). Then the
tissue was directly minced and dissociated in a sterile
collagenase, type II solution (280 U/ml, Worthington)
at 37°C for 40-60 minutes. Cell suspension was run
through cell strainers with different pore diameters,
respectively 100-μm and 40-μm, and subsequently
subjected to serial centrifugations. Isolated cells were
sorted for c-kit with rabbit anti-c-kit (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and magnetic immunobeads (Miltenyi)
as previously described [13, 48, 49]. c-kit positive cells
were cultured and expanded in Ham’s F12 medium,
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(Euroclone), 5% (v/v) horse serum (Euroclone), 100 mM
glutathione, 10U/ml erythropoietin (Sigma-Aldrich),
100 ug/ml bFGF (Peprotech). rCPCs were used for
experiments from P3 to P6.

Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from hearts finely
minced and incubated in collagenase/dispase 1:1 buffer (1
mg/mL, 200 U/mL each) for several rounds of 20′ at 37°C
until final samples dissociation. Low speed centrifugation
was used to remove myocytes and debris. Cell suspension
was obtained by several mashes separations (70 μm and 40
μm diameter pores) and centrifugation. Fibroblasts were
plated and cultured in Ham's F12 medium, supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5% (v/v) horse serum,
100 mM glutathione, 10 U/mL erythropoietin, 100 μg/
mL bFGF. After twenty-four hours, floating cells were
discarded and adherent cells, mainly fibroblasts, were
cultured in the same medium.
Rat embryonic myoblasts (H9c2) were obtained
from ATCC. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium
(Euroclone, Italy), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum.
Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAOECs) were
obtained from ECACC and amplified in Rat Endothelial

number of living cells. Optical density (OD) was measured
at 540 nm with iMark microplate reader (Biorad).

Cell treatment

Western blotting

rCPCs, H9c2, fibroblasts and RAOECs were
exposed to 0.5 μM DOXO (Adriblastina, Pfizer) for 24h.
This concentration of DOXO is comparable with drug
plasma levels in patients after standard infusion [20, 50].
To silence miR-34a, rCPCs were exposed for 24
hours to 10 nM has-miR-34a-5p mirVana miRna inhibitor
(Ant34a) (Ambion). MCF7 were exposed for 24 hours to
5-10-30-60-100 nM Ant34a. MirVana miRNA inhibitor
negative control (AntCTL) (Ambion) was used as control.
Transfection of Ant34a or AntCTL was performed with
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (2 μl/ml)
and Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then treated
with 0.5 μM DOXO for 24h.

Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 250
mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors
(Sigma-Aldrich). 20 μg/lane of total cellular proteins
were resolved by 10-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane
(Thermo Fisher). Membranes were probed with primary
antibodies against p16INK4, SIRT1, acetyl-p53Lys370,
acetyl-p53Lys381 (Abcam), p53 (Cell Signaling), Bcl2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled
secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)
were used to detect primary antibody and developed
by a chemiluminescence-based detection system (ECL,
Amersham). Loading conditions were determined with
α-Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were obtained by
ChemiDoc-it 500 Imaging System and analyzed by
Vision Works LS analysis software (UVP).

Cell proliferation
Cell proliferation was evaluated by Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) Labeling and Detection Kit I (Roche). One
hour before the end of the experiment, rCPCs were
incubated with BrdU (10 μM). The cells were fixed and
stained as suggested by manufacturer's instructions. Cell
proliferation was determined by the percentage of BrdUpositive cells.

TdT assay
Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay was used for the
detection of apoptosis by ApoAlert DNA fragmentation kit
(Clontech). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and then stained as suggested by manufacturer's
instructions. The number of apoptotic cells (TdT-positive)
was counted blindly in randomly selected fields at 1000x
magnification and expressed as a percentage of a total
number of counted cells.

Collection of CM
Cell culture media from treated rCPCs were
centrifuged for 5’ at 200g and the supernatants were
collected. H9c2, fibroblasts and RAOECs were exposed
to rCPC CM for 48h.

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase
Senescent cells were detected by senescenceassociated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity using
the artificial substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-Dgalactoside (X-gal) (Promega) [52]. Briefly, cells were
fixed for 5 min in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde
(Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 37°C with fresh SAβ-Gal staining solution containing 1 mg/ml X-gal. Cell
senescence was determined by the percentage of β-gal
positive cells.

Cell viability assay
MTT
(3-(4,
5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to
determine cell viability [51]. Yellow MTT is reduced to
purple formazan when mitochondrial reductase enzymes
are active. This conversion is directly related to the

Quantitative real-time PCR

Cloning and luciferase reporter assay for pGL3SIRT1-3’UTR vector

Total RNA was extracted from rCPCs by Trizol
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both cDNA
synthesis and PCR were performed simultaneously by
using the SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green OneStep qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time
PCR (qPCR) was carried out using the CFX96 Realtime system (Bio-Rad). The transcript levels of SIRT1
and Bcl-2 were detected and the housekeeping gene
encoding hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
(HPRT) was used as internal control for mRNA
expression studies. Relative expression was calculated
using the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method
(2−ΔΔCt).

pGL3-SIRT1-3’UTR vectors (Supplementary
Table 1) were obtained as previous described [53] and
transfected into MCF7 cells using using Lipofectamine
2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen), following
supplier’s instructions. 1 μg pGL3-Sirt1-3’UTR plasmids
plus mimic-miR-34a-5p (100 nM and 200 nM) (pre-miR34a) or mimic-miR-CTL (200 nM) (pre-miR-CTL) were
used. For normalization, 1 μg pMAX-GFP vector was
transfected into all the samples. Luciferase activity was
measured after 24 and 48 h from pGL3-SIRT1-3’UTR
transfections as reported protocol [53]. The results were
expressed as normalized luciferase activity.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

Quantitative real-time PCR of miR-34a from
cells and tissues

MiR-34a was detected by FISH according to
protocol previously described [54] and modified as follow.
Tissues sections were digested by 0.5μg/ml proteinase-K
for 10’ at RT. miRCURY LNA detection probe hsa-miR34a, 5’-DIG and 3’-DIG labeled and control probe LNA
U6 snRNA, 5’-DIG labeled (Exiqon) were used at 50
nM and 10 nM respectively and denatured as suggested
by manufacturer's instructions. To detect signal AntiDigoxigenin antibody (Abcam) and TSA Fluorescein
Plus evaluation kit (Perkin Elmer) were used. rCPCs were
identified by c-kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), myocytes
were labeled with α-sarcomeric actin (Sigma-Aldrich) and
nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples
were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope.

MiRNAs were extracted from cells by MirVana
miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. MiRNAs were also isolated
from organs by miRCury RNA Isolation Kit (Exiqon)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reversetranscription (RT) were performed by TaqMan MicroRNA
Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystem) and
GeneAmp PCR System 9700. qPCR were performed by
using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystem) using the CFX96 Real-time system (BioRad). RT and qPCR used TaqMan® MicroRNA Assays
(Applied Biosystem). Levels of miR-34a were detected
and were normalized byRNU6B (U6) as internal control
for miRNAs expression studies. Relative expression was
calculated using the comparative cycle threshold (Ct)
method (2−ΔΔCt).

In vivo studies
The present study conforms to the National Ethical
Guidelines (Italian Ministry of Health; D.L.vo 26, March
4, 2014) and has been performed upon approval of local
ethics committee. Cardiomyopathy was induced in 2-3
months old female Fisher 344 rats (Harlan Laboratories)
(n=10) by 6 intraperitoneal injections of 2.5 mg/kg of
DOXO over a period of 2 weeks to reach a cumulative
dose of 15 mg/kg [13, 17, 25]. Control rats (n=5) were
injected with saline solution. At 3 weeks after the first
injection of DOXO, animals were anesthetized with
ketamine (100 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) and echocardiographic
parameters were analysed with a high resolution MicroUltrasound system System (Vevo 770, VisualSonics Inc.)
equipped with a 25- MHz linear transducer [55, 56]. FS
and EF were calculated. The animals were sacrificed and
organs and blood samples were collected.

Quantitative real-time PCR of miR-34a from cell
culture media, rat plasma and exosomes
Cell culture media were collected after cell
treatment and concentrated by Centrifugal Filter
Units (Millipore). Rat blood samples were collected
and centrifuged to obtain plasma. MiRNAs were
extracted from cell culture media and from rat plasma
by miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit (Qiagen) and from
circulating exosomes by exoRNeasy Serum/Plasma
Midi Kit(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. RT were performed by miScript II RT kit
(Qiagen) and GeneAmp PCR System 9700. qPCR were
performed by using the miScript SybrGreen PCR Kit
using the CFX96 Real-time system (Bio-Rad). qPCR
used miScript Primer Assay. MiR-34a levels were
detected and normalized by using C. elegans miR-39
miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Spike-in control. Relative
expression was calculated using the comparative cycle
threshold (Ct) method (2−ΔΔCt).
