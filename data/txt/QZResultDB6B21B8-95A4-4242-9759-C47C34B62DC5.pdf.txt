Abstract
Resveratrol, a well-established phytoestrogen and chemopreventive agent, has gained much attention among oncologists because it can act as both estrogen receptor agonist and
antagonist, depending on dosage and cell context. It is
increasingly accepted that steroidal receptor coregulators
may also function in the cytoplasmic compartment. Deregulation and altered localization of these coregulators could
influence target gene expression and participate in the
development of hormone-responsive cancers. Proline-, glutamic acid–, and leucine-rich protein-1 (PELP1), a novel
estrogen receptor (ER) coactivator, plays an important role
in the genomic and nongenomic actions of ER. Furthermore,
recent studies have shown that differential compartmentalization of PELP1 could be crucial in modulating sensitivity to
tamoxifen. In this study, we investigated the role of PELP1 in
resveratrol-induced autophagy in lung cancer and salivary
gland adenocarcinoma cell lines. Resveratrol reversibly
inhibited the growth of these cancer cell lines and induced
autophagy, as evidenced by microtubule-associated protein 1
light chain 3 (LC3) up-regulation in a time-dependent and
3-methyladenine–sensitive manner. Confocal microscopic
analysis showed that resveratrol induced PELP1 accumulation
in autophagosomes with green fluorescent protein-LC3. The
intermediary molecule involved in PELP1 accumulation in
resveratrol-induced autophagosomes is hepatocyte growth
factor–regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS), a trafficking
molecule that binds to PELP1. These results identify PELP1 for
the first time in autophagosomes, implying that both PELP1
and HRS reallocate to autophagosomes in response to
resveratrol treatment, which might be important in the
process of autophagy in the cancer cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Proline-, glutamic acid–, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) is a
novel estrogen receptor (ER) coregulatory protein that positively
modulates ER transcriptional functions. PELP1 is overexpressed in
breast tumors, and recent evidence indicates that it plays a
permissive role in estradiol (E2)-mediated cell cycle progression via
its regulatory interaction with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb)

pathway (1, 2). In particular, deregulation of PELP1 in breast cancer
cells hypersensitizes tumor cells to E2, leading to an increased G1-S
phase transition. Because PELP1 overexpression increases both
basal and E2-induced pRb phosphorylation and cyclin D1
transcription, this effect has been attributed to the ability of
PELP1 to bind directly to pRb in response to E2 and to affect cyclin
D1 transcription. The intracellular localization of PELP1 accounts
for its role as an ER coactivator (3, 4). PELP1 is mainly localized in
the nucleus, although its nuclear abundance varies between
different tissues. However, PELP1 can also be localized in the
cytoplasm and in the proximity of the plasma membrane,
suggesting that PELP1 may have a role in nongenomic ER signaling
and possibly in selective ER modulator (SERM) resistance (2). More
recently, it was shown that PELP1 interacts in the cytoplasm with
hepatocyte growth factor–regulated tyrosine kinase substrate
(HRS), a molecule that plays a role in endosomal membrane
trafficking (5).
Resveratrol, a phytochemical found in grapes and red wine, has
been categorized as a phytoestrogen because of its ability to bind
and activate ERa. It has both estrogenic and antiestrogenic
properties and therefore has characteristics similar to the SERMs
(6). Resveratrol inhibits in vitro growth of cancer cells of diverse
origin (breast carcinoma, ovarian cancer, hepatoblastoma, leukemia, colon cancer, and prostate cancer cell lines) via induction of
apoptosis and/or other mechanisms, including autophagy (7).
Besides this, it has been shown that resveratrol suppresses 7,12dimethylbenz(a)anthracene–induced mammary carcinogenesis in
rats (8).
Autophagy is a genetically programmed, evolutionarily conserved process that degrades long-lived cellular proteins and
organelles. This process is important in normal development and
response to changing environmental stimuli and is also important
in numerous diseases, including bacterial and viral infections,
neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease (9).
Autophagy involves the formation of large double-membrane
vesicles, called autophagosomes, which encapsulate cytoplasm
and organelles and then fuse with lysosomes, thus degrading the
contents of the vesicles. This process is also thought to have an
important role in tumor development. In cancer cells, autophagy
acts as a tumor suppressor in the initial stages of tumorigenesis but
as a promoter of tumor progression in the advanced stages (10, 11).
Various treatments induce autophagy in cancer cells (12).
Tamoxifen, which targets the ER, induces autophagic cell death
in breast cancer cells through down-regulation of the protein
kinase B/Akt. Temozolomide, a DNA alkylating agent, induces
autophagy in malignant glioma cells. Despite these examples,
however, it is highly controversial whether autophagy ultimately
plays a role in the protection from or the induction of cancer cell
death (13). A better understanding of the molecular mechanism

and the regulatory pathways that control autophagy may provide a
useful way to prevent cancer development, limit tumor progression, and increase the efficacy of cancer treatments.
In this study, we found that resveratrol reversibly inhibited the
growth of lung cancer and salivary gland adenocarcinoma cell lines
by autophagy, as evidenced by the up-regulation of microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a marker of autophagy, in a
time-dependent and 3-methyladenine–sensitive manner. Confocal
microscopic analysis showed that resveratrol induced the accumulation of PELP1 in autophagosomes and PELP1 colocalized with
green fluorescent protein-LC3 (GFP-LC3). In addition, we identified
HRS, a PELP1-binding protein, as an intermediary molecule
involved in the accumulation of PELP1 in resveratrol-induced
autophagosomes. Our results for the first time provided a glimpse
of PELP1 and HRS together in autophagosomes in response to
resveratrol, an association that may be important in the process of
autophagy in cancer cells.

Results
Resveratrol inhibited the growth of several human cancer
cell lines. Because previous studies have shown that resveratrol
binds to ERa and ERh and acts as a mixed agonist and antagonist
(6), we explored the possibility of its effect on growth in lung cancer
and salivary gland adenocarcinoma cell lines expressing ERa, ERh,
or both. Our results showed that resveratrol greatly inhibited the

growth of the ERa- and ERh-positive lung cancer cell lines A549
and H460 and the ERh-positive salivary gland adenocarcinoma cell
lines HSG and HSY (Fig. 1A). This growth inhibition was augmented
with increasing resveratrol concentrations, although the physiologic concentration, 100 Amol/L (16), was the one at which
maximum growth inhibition was achieved (Fig. 1B).
Next, to determine the reversibility of the growth inhibition
caused by resveratrol, H460, A549, HSG, and HSY cells were treated
with resveratrol for 24 h. Then, the medium was washed with PBS
and replaced with medium without resveratrol, and the cells were
cultured for another 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1C, resveratrol
treatment during the first 24 h inhibited the growth of all four cell
lines, whereas the removal of resveratrol improved the growth rate
during the second 48-h period, indicating that the growth
inhibition caused by resveratrol is reversible.
Resveratrol induced changes in cell cycle distribution in
human cancer cell lines. Because several studies have shown that
resveratrol inhibits cell growth by affecting cellular proliferation
(17–19), we examined the effect of resveratrol on the cell cycle
distribution of H460, A549, HSG, and HSY cells. Resveratrol treatment of lung cancer cell lines H460 and A549 resulted in a substantial arrest of the cell cycles at the G1 phase, whereas salivary
gland adenocarcinoma cell lines HSG and HSY accumulated in the
S phase (Table 1; Fig. 2A). To examine the mechanism by which
resveratrol arrested cells in the G1 phase, we analyzed the status of
several cell cycle regulatory proteins. Among all the cell cycle proteins analyzed, we observed the most profound change in the status
of phosphorylated pRb. pRb plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation (20). It has also been shown to inactivate
E2F through direct interaction and sequestration. However, phosphorylation of pRb by cell cycle–dependent kinases releases E2F,
thus leading to G1-S phase progression. Because we hypothesized
that resveratrol-mediated cell cycle arrest could be due to dephosphorylation of activated pRb, we analyzed phosphorylation of pRb

cell lines by resveratrol. A, H460 and A549
cells were arrested in the G1 phase and HSG
and HSY cells in the S phase after resveratrol
treatment. Cells were fixed, treated with
RNase, and then stained with propidium iodide.
B, H460 cells were treated with 100 Amol/L
resveratrol for 24 h and phosphorylation of pRb
and expression of p21 and p27 were analyzed
by Western blotting. C, H460 and HSY cells
were treated with 100 Amol/L resveratrol and
then stained with DAPI to examine whether
nuclear fragmentation by apoptosis in these
cells was induced by resveratrol treatment.

in H460 cells by Western blotting. We found that phosphorylation
of pRb decreased 6 h after resveratrol treatment, and this decrease
continued until 24 h, indicating that inactivation of pRb was
blocked by resveratrol (Fig. 2B). The status of the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 were also investigated. The levels of
both p21 and p27 were elevated 6 h after resveratrol treatment, and
this increase continued further. Taken together, these results
indicated that the cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase of H460 could
result from a series of steps caused by up-regulation of cyclindependent kinase inhibitors, hypophosphorylation of Rb, and arrest
of the cell cycle in G1 (Fig. 2B).
We found it interesting to note that in experiments using H460
cells, nuclear fragmentation was observed in a few cells treated with
resveratrol for 24 h by 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
staining, indicating that H460 cells undergo apoptosis (Fig. 2C).
This process was not observed in salivary gland adenocarcinoma
cells, indicating that resveratrol-induced apoptosis is cell line specific.
Resveratrol induced expression of LC3, a marker of
autophagy. A previous study showed that resveratrol inhibited
the growth of ovarian cancer cells by autophagy (18). Although the
molecular pathways involved in the execution and regulation of
apoptosis have been well defined, the mechanisms of autophagic
cell death have not. In fact, aside from the finding that autophagic
cell death is a caspase-independent process, investigations into
autophagic cell death have been largely limited to discovering the
morphologic characteristics of cells involved in the process, such as
extensive autophagosomal formation and Atg-8/LC3 translocation
to autophagic vesicles (21). Thus, to determine whether the cell
growth inhibition and death caused by resveratrol is due to
autophagy, and given the importance of the induction the typical
autophagy marker LC3 as an indication of autophagy (10), we
checked LC3 expression in lung and salivary gland cancer cells

after treatment with resveratrol. LC3 expression was induced at
3 h and reached a maximum 24 h after resveratrol treatment in
both H460 and HSY cells, indicating that the phytoestrogen resveratrol induced autophagy in both cell lines (Fig. 3A).
To validate our finding that the growth inhibition is reversible
and due to autophagy, we analyzed the expression of LC3 in cells
treated with resveratrol both before and after being washed with
PBS. The expression of LC3 that was induced by resveratrol
treatment decreased in H460 and HSY cells after it was washed off
(Fig. 3B). This confirmed that the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on
cell growth is due to autophagy and is reversible.
Resveratrol-induced LC3 expression is inhibited by 3methyladenine, U0126, and pepstatin A. To further substantiate
the role of autophagy in resveratrol inhibition of cell growth, we
examined the effect of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine.
3-Methyladenine is a specific inhibitor of autophagy that acts at the
sequestration stage when a double-membrane structure forms
around a portion of the cytosol (22). We treated H460 cells with
3-methyladenine for 1 h before resveratrol treatment to determine
whether resveratrol-induced LC3 expression was reduced by
3-methyladenine treatment. Indeed, LC3 expression stimulated by
resveratrol was substantially blocked by 3-methyladenine (Fig. 4A).
Then, because activation of the RAF1-MEK/extracellular signal–
regulated kinase pathway by RAS stimulates autophagy (23), we
examined whether a MEK inhibitor, U0126, inhibited resveratrolinduced LC3 expression. Treatment with U0126 at a concentration of 20 Amol/L effectively reduced LC3 expression in H460 cells
(Fig. 4B). The aspartatic protease cathepsin D is abundant in
lysosomes and plays an important role in autophagy in a various
cells (24). Therefore, we also examined whether the cathepsin D
inhibitor pepstatin A affected induction of LC3 expression caused
by resveratrol. Treatment with 100 Amol/L pepstatin A for

blotting. B, H460 and HSY cells were treated with

PBS thrice (at time indicated by arrow ), and then
cultured in the same medium without resveratrol for
6 additional hours. The autophagy marker LC3
was analyzed by Western blotting.

1 h before resveratrol treatment effectively blocked the induction of
LC3 expression by resveratrol (Fig. 4C).
Because activation of Akt by class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
has been shown to inhibit autophagy via activation of mammalian
target of rapamycin (9), we next analyzed the activation status of
Akt in H460 and HSY cells after treatment with resveratrol.
Although there was no change in the level of total Akt,
phosphorylation of Akt was reduced in both cell lines (Fig. 4D).
As expected, there was a considerable increase in the levels of LC3
expression after resveratrol treatment. Taken together, all these
results confirmed that autophagy is the main cause of the
antiproliferative effect of resveratrol in these cell lines.
PELP1 in resveratrol-induced autophagosomes. It is known
that when autophagy is not activated, LC3 is localized homogeneously in the cytoplasm; however, on initiation of autophagy,
LC3 associates with the isolation membrane and then remains
associated with the autophagosomal membrane after these
vacuoles are formed, indicating that LC3 can be used as a marker
of autophagosomes (12). Because the presence of autophagic
vacuoles in cancer cells after treatment with resveratrol indicates
that they undergo autophagy and because GFP-LC3 localizes in the
autophagosomes, we examined for cells transfected with GFP-LC3
and treated with resveratrol for autophagic vacuoles by immunofluorescence analysis. Autophagic H460 and HSY cells were
identified by their characteristic GFP-LC3 dots on fluorescence
microscopy (Fig. 5A).
Because resveratrol is known to bind to ERs as both agonist and
antagonist (6) and it is known that, in addition to its direct ER
binding, resveratrol has many non–ER-mediated cellular activities
that may influence ER transcriptional activation through cross-talk
mechanisms, we hypothesized that resveratrol induction of
autophagy might have something to do with either the ER by
itself or with one of its coactivators localized in the cytoplasm. This
raised the possibility that PELP1, being able to bind to both ERa
and ERh (2) and a coactivator of both, owing to its localization in

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

both cytoplasm and nucleus, plays a role in resveratrol autophagy
induction. Another notable property of PELP1 is its ability to
interact with HRS, an early endosomal protein that plays a role in
regulating the trafficking of growth factor-receptor complexes
through early endosomes (5). HRS sequesters PELP1 in the
cytoplasm. Recently, an orthologue of HRS, CeVPS-27, was found
to play a role in the endosomal and autophagic pathways in the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (25). On the basis of all these
findings, we examined the localization of endogenous PELP1 in
both control and resveratrol-treated H460 and HSY cells. PELP1
was mostly present in the nuclei of H460 cells under control
conditions, whereas resveratrol treatment induced the accumulation of PELP1 in vacuole-like compartments in the cytoplasm
(Fig. 5B). These compartments were considered to be autophagosomes produced during autophagy. This finding provided a clue
that PELP1 might be localized in autophagosomes. To substantiate
this finding, we determined whether PELP1 is colocalized with
GFP-LC3, a typical marker of autophagy in cells transfected with
GFP-LC3 and treated with resveratrol. Confocal microscopic
analysis showed that GFP-LC3 colocalized with endogenous PELP1
in autophagosomes in H460 and HSY cells treated with resveratrol
(Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that PELP1 and LC3 are together
in the autophagosomes.
The recent characterization of cytoplasmic PELP1 functions in
our studies showed that it interacts in the cytoplasm with HRS, a
trafficking molecule that activates mitogen-activated protein
kinase in the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor,
presumably by sequestering PELP1 in the cytoplasm. The fact that
the general mechanism of autophagy involves the sequestration of
cargo material into autophagosomes (11) raises the possibility that
some sequestering molecule is involved in the localization of
PELP1 in autophagosomes. Therefore, we next sought to determine
whether HRS is what brings PELP1 to the autophagosomes. To
verify this, we treated H460 cells with resveratrol and stained them
for endogenous HRS and PELP1; we found that HRS colocalized

PELP1 in Autophagosomes

with PELP1 in the autophagosomes (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these
results proved that HRS indeed brings PELP1 to the autophagosomes. To determine whether resveratrol-induced autophagosomes
were reduced by 3-methyladenine treatment, H460 cells were
transfected with GFP-LC3, left untreated or pretreated with 3methyladenine for 1 h before treatment with resveratrol for 24 h,
fixed, and then immunolabeled with anti-PELP1 antibody. The
formation of autophagosomes induced by resveratrol in H460 cells
was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (Fig. 5D).
To further confirm the HRS-dependent recruitment of PELP1 to
autophagosomes on resveratrol treatment, we used HRS-specific
siRNA to down-regulate HRS in cells treated with resveratrol, which
were stained for HRS and PELP1. We found that in cells treated

with resveratrol, HRS colocalized with PELP1 in the autophagosomes, whereas in HRS-knockdown cells, the number of PELP1positive autophagosomes decreased drastically in resveratrol-treated
cells (Fig. 6A). Together, these findings strengthen our hypothesis
that HRS and PELP1 interact in the cytoplasm and move together to
the autophagosomes on treatment with resveratrol. Recent
studies from our group (26) showed that the cytoplasmic
localization of PELP1 promotes resistance to SERMs. Because
autophagy is a major intracellular pathway for the degradation
and recycling of long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles
and because we found PELP1 in autophagosomes in response to
resveratrol treatment, we speculated that this has some
physiologic relevance to the protein levels of PELP1. To explore

this possibility, we treated HSY and H460 cells with resveratrol
and then checked their LC3 and PELP1 protein levels. The results
of this experiment clearly showed that the PELP1 protein level
was considerably lower in samples treated with resveratrol than it
was in control samples (Fig. 6B). These differential changes in
PELP1 levels in different cell lines could possibly be attributed
to the effects of resveratrol on cell cycle progression, with a
significant decrease when cells undergo G1 arrest (H460) but not
an S-phase arrest (HSY). There was also a clear increase in LC3
expression, indicating that these cells indeed undergo autophagy.
Preliminary results from this experiment suggested that cells use
autophagy as a means of degrading PELP1 in the cytoplasm in
response to resveratrol treatment.

Discussion
The resveratrol-induced localization of the ER coactivator PELP1
in autophagosomes and its physiologic importance in cancer cells
were the key issues being intensely investigated in this study. Our
results showed that resveratrol inhibited cell growth and induced
autophagy in various cancer cell lines in a reversible and 3methyladenine–sensitive manner and that PELP1 is recruited to
autophagosomes in response to resveratrol treatment.

The transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors is not only
regulated by hormones but is also affected by several regulatory
proteins called coactivators and corepressors (27). The novel ER
coactivator PELP1 plays a role in both the genomic and
nongenomic actions of ER. PELP1 is predominantly localized in
the nucleus in hormonally responsive tissues, but recent findings
suggest that PELP1 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm in
cancer cells, leading to excessive nongenomic signaling and
possibly to SERM resistance (1).
The antiproliferative activity of the phytoestrogen resveratrol
against tumor cell lines of different origin has been extensively
characterized (7, 18). Opipari et al. (18) reported that resveratrol
induces both apoptosis and autophagy in ovarian cancer cells. A
number of studies showed cell cycle arrest of cancer cells induced
by resveratrol and the ultimate induction of apoptosis and/or
autophagy. Resveratrol treatment resulted in the S-phase arrest of
ovarian cancer cell lines (28). Pozo-Guisado et al. (29) showed
that MCF-7 breast cancer cells accumulated in the S phase after
treatment with 50 Amol/L resveratrol, but at the 100 Amol/L
concentration, they were blocked in the G1 phase. The same was
the case with ovarian cancer cells (18). However, in this study, we
found that 100 Amol/L treatment with resveratrol resulted in the

arrest of H460 and A549 lung cancer cells in the G1 phase and of
HSG and HSY salivary gland cancer cells in the S phase. This
variation between different cell lines may be attributable to the
difference in their basal proliferation rates. However, the overall
outcome from these studies is that resveratrol provokes arrest of
the cell cycle, preventing cancer cells from multiplying.
In our study, we found that resveratrol modulated cell cycle
regulatory phosphorylated Rb and that the observed cell cycle
arrest was associated with the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb. Recently, Kim et al. (17) showed that resveratrol inhibits
proliferation of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells by
blocking them in the G1 phase and that this was associated with
hypophosphorylated Rb. Our study showed that PELP1 was
recruited to autophagosomes by resveratrol, and because PELP1
is known to regulate the cell cycle by interaction with pRb, we
hypothesized that the recruitment of PELP1 to autophagosomes
results in its degradation and might be related to the cell cycle
arrest at the G1 phase in H460 cells. Previous studies showed that
E2 induces up-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and that this
increase is implicated in pRb phosphorylation (30). Furthermore,
pRb is a coactivator and regulates cyclin D1 expression. Because
our previous study showed that PELP1 overexpression resulted in
persistent expression of cyclin D1 and hyperphosphorylation of
pRb (3), it might be possible that resveratrol recruitment of PELP1
into autophagosomes causes down-regulation of cyclin D1,
inducing the hypophosphorylation of pRb. It was reported earlier
that cyclin D1 expression decreased with resveratrol treatment in
SW480 colon carcinoma cells (16); Wolter et al. (19) also showed
that finding in colon cancer cell lines.

In general, autophagy induces degradation of cytoplasmic
proteins and organelles under both physiologic and pathologic
conditions (9). The ER coactivator PELP1 has been shown to
interact with HRS in the cytoplasm. Previously, an HRS orthologue,
CeVPS-27, was found to play a role in the autophagic pathways in
C. elegans (25). In this context, we hypothesized that during the
process of autophagy induced by resveratrol, HRS clings to PELP1
as it is recruited into the autophagosomes, causing the degradation
of PELP1 (Fig. 6C). This degraded PELP1 might be compensated for
by the transition of PELP1 from the nuclear compartment to the
cytoplasm. Till now, there are no reports about what regulates
shuttling of PELP1 from nucleus to cytoplasm or vice versa.
Because the cytoplasmic localization of PELP1 maybe linked with
SERM resistance, another possibility is that cells might be using
autophagy as a means of degrading PELP1 in the cytoplasm in
response to resveratrol treatment. Further studies are needed to
clearly understand the role of PELP1 in autophagy. It is quiet
possible that other coactivators that bind to ERa and ERh may
have similar function as PELP1. In conclusion, these results give us
a clue to the biological and physiologic mechanisms underlying
autophagy in cancer cells.
