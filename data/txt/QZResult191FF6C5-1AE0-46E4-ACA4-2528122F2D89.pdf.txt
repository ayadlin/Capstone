Abstract:
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most highly lethal malignancies
ranking as the third leading-cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although
surgical resection and transplantation are effective curative therapies, very few
patients qualify for such treatments due to the advanced stage of the disease at
diagnosis. In this context, loco-regional therapies provide a viable therapeutic
alternative with minimal systemic toxicity. However, as chemoresistance and tumor
recurrence negatively impact the success of therapy resulting in poorer patient
outcomes it is imperative to identify new molecular target(s) in cancer cells that
could be effectively targeted by novel agents. Recent research has demonstrated that
proliferation in HCC is associated with increased glucose metabolism. The glycolytic
enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a multifunctional
protein primarily recognized for its role in glucose metabolism, has already been
shown to affect the proliferative potential of cancer cells. In human HCC, the
increased expression of GAPDH is invariably associated with enhanced glycolytic
capacity facilitating tumor progression. Though it is not yet known whether GAPDH
up-regulation contributes to tumorigenesis sensu stricto, emerging evidence points
to the existence of a link between GAPDH up-regulation and the promotion of survival
mechanisms in cancer cells as well as chemoresistance. The involvement of GAPDH in
several hepatocarcinogenic mechanisms (e.g. viral hepatitis, metabolic alterations)
and its sensitivity to a new class of prospective anticancer agents prompted us to
review the current understanding of the therapeutic potential of targeting GAPDH in
HCC.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) is a classical protein with enormous
biochemical and biophysical interests owing to its
functional significance in glucose metabolism. The
focus on GAPDH has gained further momentum with
recent discoveries unraveling its non-glycolytic (nonenzymatic) roles associated with cell death and diseases.
Pharmacologically, GAPDH obeys the cardinal rules
of “druggability” due to its disease relevance and the
presence of an inhibitory site (e.g. catalytic domain of an
enzyme, ligand-binding site of a receptor). Although, it has
been estimated that at least 2-5% of the human genome
(among ~30,000 genes) may form potential therapeutic
targets [1], the key requirements of “druggability”, in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the interests of pharmaceutical industry or any drugdevelopment programs, restrict the number dramatically
into fewer candidates. Nonetheless, the efficacy of the
agent(s) targeting such a “druggable molecule” and the
tolerable systemic toxicity and so on, will eventually
determine the fate of successful clinical translation.
Current advancement in understanding the cancerrelated roles of GAPDH together with the sensitivity
of tumor cells to its inhibition designates GAPDH as a
potential molecular target in cancer treatment. Several
elegant reviews by Sirover and others have delineated
the functional diversity of GAPDH, particularly its
participation in cell death and survival mechanisms [2-6].
The aim of the current review is to critically evaluate, from

GAPDH and its therapeutic potential in liver cancer.

the patients to other treatment modalities. Among other
therapeutic options for HCC, loco-regional therapies have
the unique advantage of selective-targeting of tumors
(primarily under image guidance), thereby evading
systemic toxicity [9]. In clinics, the loco-regional therapies
in practice consist of intra-arterial chemo-embolization
or radio-embolization [10, 11] and percutaneous
ablative therapies [12-15]. The effectiveness of locoregional targeted-delivery in achieving tumor ablation
greatly impacted the development of new, potential
chemotherapeutic agents of high target-specificity and
tolerable-toxicity profile. Nevertheless, as HCC is always
associated with an underlying disease, it is imperative to
administer any novel agent that selectively targets tumor
cells with a high level molecular specificity. Recently,
there has been a tremendous progress in the development
of various therapeutics targeting different pathways or
molecules of HCC[16, 17], yet the therapeutic success
is often counteracted by chemoresistance and tumor
recurrence necessitating the search for sensitive target
molecule(s) that can be effectively targeted by potent
inhibitors/drugs.

Liver cancer and current therapeutic challenges
Liver cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies
and consistently ranked as the third most common cause
of cancer-related death worldwide [7]. Intense research
both at preclinical and clinical levels contributed a wealth
of information on the causes and risk factors of liver
cancer. In general, functional impairment of normal liver
by hepatitis (due to the infection of hepatitis B and C
viruses), excessive alcohol consumption, and aflatoxin B,
in addition to oncogenic driver mutations, are considered
as some of the causal factors that promote cirrhosis
eventually leading to liver cancer [e.g. hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC)] (Figure 1). Statistically, the incidence
of HCC in the Unites States is on the rise, secondary to a
parallel rise in hepatitis C virus (HCV). In HCC, patient
survival remains poor at less than nine months, and
largely depends on the stage of the disease. Patients with
intermediate-stage disease show better 3-year survival
expectancy than advanced-stage disease (viz., 50% vs.
8%) [8]. Current curative therapies include surgical
resection and transplantation, and are very effective in
early-stage disease, however very few patients qualify for
such treatments. The asymptomatic nature of HCC and the
lack of an early-detection marker invariably result in the
diagnosis of the disease at an advanced stage enforcing

Rationale for molecular targeting of tumor
metabolism in liver cancer
Liver cancer has long been known to have
increased-glucose metabolism, a prominent biochemicalsignature of solid tumors. This tumor-specific metabolic

phenotype plays pivotal roles in several biosynthetic
processes facilitating uninterrupted growth. Further, recent
data indicate that oncogenic driver mutations culminate
in altered signal transduction pathways enabling tumor
cells to reprogram their metabolic circuitry to adapt to the
microenvironment. For example, it has been demonstrated
that enhanced nutrient uptake is an effect of oncogenic
RAS mutations [18]. Similarly, the tumor suppressor,
p53, which has been known to be mutated in majority of
tumors, has a role in the regulation of glucose metabolism
[19]. Mounting evidence indicates that the tumorspecific shift in metabolism is vital for the uncontrolled
proliferation and invasiveness of almost all solid tumors.
Alternatively, this disparity in glucose metabolism
between tumor cells and normal cells suggests a window
of opportunity in treating cancer. This altered metabolism
has been exploited by PET imaging in clinical diagnosis
in the detection of malignant tumors using the glucose
analog, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Thus, tumor (glucose)
metabolism has been recognized as critical for tumor
growth, hence aptly described as “Cancer’s Achilles’
Heel” [20] accentuating it as a potential therapeutic target
[21, 22]. Hence, the ramifications of disrupting glucose

metabolism could be envisaged to generate desirable
anticancer effects.
Strong data provide the scientific rational for
targeting glucose metabolism in treating HCC, or
liver cancer in general. HCC has long been known to
demonstrate regulation of glycolytic enzymes facilitating
aerobic glycolysis [23]. It has also been demonstrated
that in HCC, tumor proliferation is tightly correlated with
glucose metabolism [24]. Indeed, both increased-glucose
metabolism and proliferation share common regulatory
pathways, making tumor metabolism a unique therapeutic
target [25]. The therapeutic potential of targeting tumor
metabolism triggered a renewed interest in studying
glucose-metabolism. Consequently our understanding of
the molecular regulation of tumor glycolysis has advanced
significantly [26]. Many new investigational agents with
potential inhibitory effects on glycolysis have been
developed, and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo models.
Despite promising results in preclinical tumor models [27],
the majority of these agents have not been successfully
translated into the clinic thus far, either due to the lack of
efficacy in the clinical setting and/ or significant systemic
toxicity. Thus, the need to identify a molecular target that

hepatocarcinogenesis [33-35]. Surprisingly, GAPDH
has been known to bind with CSF-1 mRNA resulting
in increased stability, thus contributing for tumorigenic
potential or malignant phenotype [36]. Moreover, analysis
of HCC patient samples revealed the incidence of GAPDH
up-regulation in human HCC strongly correlates with
c-jun, a proto-oncogene that has long been known to be
involved in liver tumorigenesis [37]. It remains to be seen
if such a correlation exists between GAPDH expression
and other oncogenes (e.g. KRAS) in HCC progression.
Though it is not known whether GAPDH up-regulation
contributes for tumorigenesis sensu stricto, adequate data
unequivocally demonstrate the existence of an association
between GAPDH over-expression and pro-survival
mechanisms [5] and chemoresistance [38] in cancer cells.
Metabolically, in human HCC, the increased
expression of GAPDH is invariably associated with
increased glycolytic capacity [23, 39], facilitating tumor
progression (Figure 2). Recently, a hitherto unknown
role of GAPDH in the regulation of mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR)-complex1 (mTOR-C1) signaling
pathway has been documented [40]. mTOR pathway
is a growth signaling mechanism that has been active
during hepatocarcinogenesis [41, 42], hence provides

is indispensable for cancer cell survival and developing an
agent to effectively inhibit the molecule remains critical
for successful anticancer therapy.

GAPDH in hepatocarcinogenic mechanisms
Several reports unravel the participation of GAPDH
in pathways that are cross-linked with cancer-specific or
cancer-related phenotypes. GAPDH has been known to
interact with the nucleic acids of Hepatitis B [28, 29] and
C [30] viruses that cause hepatitis, a major contributing
factor for hepatocarcinogenesis. Although GAPDH
binding with nucleic acids of other viruses have also been
reported (e.g. influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis virus)
[31, 32], none of those viruses have been significantly
associated with hepatocarcinogenesis or any other
carcinogenesis.
Accumulating data indicate a strong link between
GAPDH up-regulation and tumorigenic potential of
transforming cells. For example, granulocyte macrophage
(GM) colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), a factor
known to play a pivotal role in several malignancies,
has been increasingly recognized to be associated with

an opportunity for therapeutic targeting [43-48]. It has
been found that GAPDH regulates mTOR-C1 signaling
according to the availability of glucose (hence ATP).
GAPDH interaction with rheb, the activator of mTOR,
mitigates mTOR-C1 signaling pathway thus halting the
growth mechanism under conditions of energy depletion
or inadequate glycolysis. It has to be noted that only
chronic disruption but not transient inhibition of mTOR
affects tumor cells [49]. Thus, GAPDH in addition to
its role in glycolysis and energy production also signals
and regulates other pathways like mTOR, depending
upon cellular requirements. Hence, GAPDH is one of
the very few earliest metabolic enzymes to exert such
pleiotropic effects on energy metabolism and related
signaling pathways. Unlike the majority of metabolic
enzymes, GAPDH displays the unique feature of being
functionally active in all three cellular compartments;
nucleus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane. As a result,
the interaction of GAPDH with either proteins or nucleic
acids has been attributed to its diverse functions. Such
interactions have been known to result in a variety of
effects; (a) its interaction with VDAC-1 initiating proapoptotic membrane permeabilization of mitochondria

[50], (b) its binding with tubulin affecting cytoskeletal
structures and membrane trafficking and (c) its localization
within endoplasmic reticulum (ER) affecting secretory
pathway. GAPDH also interacts with RNA (e.g. human
tRNA, lymphokine mRNA), and DNA (e.g. binding with
telomere [38, 51]), and has been known to impact the
genetic regulation of Oct-1 by participating in the OCA-s
complex.
Such a multifaceted role for a single protein
(GAPDH) would nevertheless require complex structural
organization and regulation under dynamic physiological
conditions. In this context the role of posttranslational
modification (PTM) of GAPDH has been critically
analyzed. It has been well documented that GAPDH
undergoes one or more modifications such as acetylation,
O-GlcNAcylation, S-nitrosylation, thiolation and “siah-1binding” depending upon its cellular function. All of these
PTMs have already been known to affect the enzymatic
function of GAPDH [52]. In other words, PTMs that
underlie GAPDH’s non-glycolytic roles eventually affects
its glycolytic function.
Since it has been established that GAPDH achieves
its non-glycolytic functions through PTMs, compromising

its glycolytic role conceivably, it would have serious
consequences on the bioenergetics of cancer cells.
Nevertheless, its cellular abundance and cancer-specific
over-expression could compensate or satisfy for the
variety of functions while maintaining tumor glycolysis.
From an experimental therapeutic point of view, the
multiple roles of GAPDH such as enzymic function
(in energy metabolism), scaffold or adaptor protein
(in vesicular trafficking) makes GAPDH an attractive
molecular target to achieve desired anticancer effects. In
other words, blockade of GAPDH would impair multiple
pathways / mechanisms forcing cancer cells to become
fragile, eventually causing their death.

disrupt its function.
Though enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) [53] and hexokinase II (HKII) [54] have been
investigated in preclinical tumor models for their
therapeutic potential, their respective inhibitors are yet to
be successful in clinical trials. Hence, the need to identify
a target that is critical for tumor growth but sensitive to
therapy remains unanswered. As discussed elsewhere,
the tumor specific roles of GAPDH include, apart
from its glycolytic function, chemoresistance [38, 55],
metastatic potential [56], protecting cells against caspaseindependent apoptosis [5] and cell cycle regulation
[57]. Thus, any interference with GAPDH’s function is
anticipated to surpass the effect of a single molecule (e.g.
LDH, HK II) targeted-therapy that exclusively targets one
molecule, and one pathway/function, where the interrupted
physiology could be compensated by collateral or
alternative mechanisms. Conceivably, GAPDH inhibition
could sensitize the cancer cells for chemotherapy, as the
protection and resistance offered by GAPDH will also be
abrogated. However, the concern of ubiquitous nature of
GAPDH, and the related systemic toxicity, needs to be
addressed.
In this context, advancements in current
interventional approaches (like loco-regional therapies,
thermal-, cryo-, and chemo-ablative therapies, nanoparticle
or lysosome-based drug delivery etc. ) and identification of
GAPDH-specific inhibitor(s) provide impetus in exploring
the therapeutic potential associated with the anti-GAPDH

Targeting GAPDH to treat liver cancer
Considering a therapeutic strategy to target
GAPDH primarily relies on (a) its disease-relevance and
(b) druggability. The rationale for considering GAPDH
as a molecular target, from an oncologist’s perspective,
chiefly depends on its disease-relevance and the desirable
phenotypic effects of abrogating its functions. Whereas,
for a pharmacologist, the accessibility and inhibition
of various domains of GAPDH by developing specific
inhibitors to block its biochemical functions provides the
rationale for drug design (Figure 3). GAPDH enzyme
exists as a tetramer (four subunits) with each subunit
having a catalytic site favoring the inhibition of the native
enzyme even at any one of the four catalytic sites to

therapeutic strategy. Thus, molecular targeting of GAPDH
by tumor-specific delivery or inhibition could provide a
viable therapeutic opportunity enabling us to overcome the
current challenges in chemotherapy.

The fungal metabolite Koningic acid (KA) has been
reported to inhibit glycolysis through the inhibition of
GAPDH [59, 60]. The antiglycolytic principle of KA has
been documented in multiple in vitro models. The efficacy
of KA has been shown to be directly proportional to the
glycolytic- dependency of cells, with cells exhibiting
increased glycolysis demonstrating higher sensitivity
[61]. KA binding site with GAPDH and the subsequent
inhibition of activity has been identified. Preliminary
reports have also demonstrated that administration of KA
within 8 days of intraperitoneal inoculation of Ehrlich
ascites tumor cells provided survival benefit to mice
compared to untreated placebo, although detailed reports
on the effect of KA on the rate of tumor growth and other
tumor types are wanting. Further investigations on KA
with a focus on selective targeting of tumor-GAPDH and
not normal cellular GAPDH would provide an opportunity
in understanding and advancing its therapeutic potential.

Preclinical efficacy of GAPDH inhibitors
Several inhibitors derived from natural and / or
synthetic sources have been investigated for their antiGAPDH efficacy in treating cancer (Figure 4, Table I).
Here, we discuss the agents that have been investigated
in preclinical models that demonstrate adequate data on
anticancer efficacy of such inhibitors.
Saframycin (Saf A)
Myers and his co-workers [58] elegantly
demonstrated the involvement of GAPDH in the antiproliferative effects of Saframycin A (Saf A), a natural
product of bacterial fermentation. This report suggested
GAPDH as a protein target of chemotherapeutic agents.
However, the principal mechanism underlying the antiproliferative effects of Saf A involves the formation of
DNA adducts as the first step followed by the binding of
the drug-DNA adduct with GAPDH protein. Although
GAPDH is implicated in the anti-proliferative effects
mediated by Saf A class agents, additional experimental
evidence is required to demonstrate if Saf A is a specific
inhibitor of GAPDH.

3-Bromopyruvate (3-BrPA)
The metabolic blocker, 3-bromopyruvate (3BrPA), a halogenated analog of pyruvic acid, has
gained significant attention due to its remarkable
antitumor effects. In vitro testing against human HCC
cells demonstrated that 3-BrPA inhibited glycolysis and
blocked ATP production causing apoptosis in a dosedependent manner [62]. Tracer studies with radio-(14C)labeled 3-BrPA demonstrated GAPDH as the primary
intracellular target of 3-BrPA. The binding of 3-BrPA

to GAPDH in multiple cell lines [63, 64] substantiated
the fact that GAPDH inhibition underlies 3-BrPA’s
antiglycolytic effect, leading to apoptotic cell death [64].
3-BrPA is one of the very few agents that have substantial
data demonstrating GAPDH as the preferred target.
Unlike other alkylating agents, 3-BrPA demonstrated
tremendous specificity in molecular targeting, enforcing
its antitumorigenic effects by promoting energy depletion,
disruption of redox balance and induction of intracellular
stress in a concurrent fashion. Therefore it appears
that 3-BrPA is an extremely promising agent due to its
tumor selectivity and ability to promote a multipronged
antitumor effect enabling it to progress towards clinical
trials.

currently IA’s use as a metabolic blocker is at higher
concentrations (~100 micromoles) where significant
cytotoxicity occurs [66]. Although the metabolic inhibitory
effect of IA has been attributed to its effect on GAPDH
activity, further investigations are required to validate
GAPDH as the primary target of IA.
Methylglyoxal (MG)
Methylglyoxal (MG) a normal metabolite of glucose
metabolism is formed during the process of glycolysis
by dephosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate or
dihydroxyacetone [67]. Methylglyoxal has been reported
to inhibit tumorigenesis by interfering with the growth
of malignant cells [68]. In the past decade reports have
indicated that methylglyoxal targets the enzyme GAPDH,
and this inhibition is the primary mechanism underlying
its anticancer effects [69]. Lee et al., [67] have also
demonstrated that the physical interaction / binding of
methylglyoxal resulted in an alteration of the structure of
GAPDH leading to inactivation. Methylglyoxal mediated
glycation has been attributed as the cause for such an
inactivation of GAPDH. Although very interesting,
additional experimental evidence validating the tumor
selectivity and molecular specificity (showing GAPDH as
the only or at least the primary target) of MG in multiple

Iodoacetate (IA)
McKee et al., [65] provided the earliest
documentation of Iodoacetate (IA)’s inhibitory role on
GAPDH in cancer cells, where the effect of GAPDH
inhibition was seen in micromolar concentrations of IA.
Interestingly at the lowest concentration (3 micromoles)
used by these investigators the cancer cells switched
from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (as evident
by an increase in oxygen consumption and a decrease in
lactate production) with no signs of cytotoxicity. However,

greater drug concentrations can be achieved within tumors
while minimizing systemic exposure. For example, the
intra-arterial delivery of 3-BrPA in animal models of liver
cancer demonstrated striking antitumor effects [77, 78] in
most cases significantly prolonged the survival [71, 79]. In
addition, combinatorial approaches can also be envisaged
for improved or better effects in cases where such dual
therapies are required. Recently, a clinical investigation
revealed a marked effect of combining sorafenib with
drug-eluting beads where the patient response was
significant [80], assuring the feasibility and effectiveness
of such loco-regional therapies.

RNAi
Several reports indicate that silencing GAPDH by
antisense oligonucleotides [70] or small-interfering (si)
RNA [57] induces apoptosis or affects cell proliferation,
in vitro. To our knowledge, until our recent documentation
[71], there was no report on the plausibility of shRNAmediated GAPDH knockdown in the management
of HCC. Yet, two major challenges to this approach
remain. They are; (i) the ubiquitous nature of GAPDH,
raising the concern for non-specific toxicity and (ii) its
intracellular abundance, which would require higher
doses of drug for therapeutic effect. To overcome these
challenges, loco-regional therapies such as percutaneous
and intra-arterial deliveries provide a viable alternative to
systemic administration [72, 73]. The unique advantage
of selectively targeting tumors under image guidance
would minimize systemic toxicity [9]. Data demonstrated
that percutaneous injection of GAPDH-antagonists block
HCC progression. Future studies on the optimization
of treatment regimen as well as delivery system with
GAPDH antagonists will enable us to characterize
the means of achieving maximal therapeutic efficacy
either alone or in combination with other therapies. For
instance, nanoparticle based slow release of potential
therapeutic agents has emerged as a promising approach
in preclinical models [74, 75]. Hence, integration of
GAPDH antagonists with nanoparticles will allow us to
improve the efficacy of therapy with minimal number
of percutaneous injections, which is feasible in clinical
translation. In summary, molecular targeting of GAPDH
via percutaneous injection of either an inhibitor, 3-BrPA,
or shRNA blocks tumor progression demonstrating the
therapeutic potential of targeting GAPDH in HCC.

Tumor specific silencing of GAPDH
The therapeutic potential of RNA interference
(RNAi) strategy for treating HCC has been increasingly
recognized [81]. Despite attempts by several groups,
the only RNAi therapeutic against liver tumor that has
entered Phase I trial is ALN-VSP02 that targets kinesinspindle protein and vascular endothelial growth factors
(ClinicalTrials.Gov, identifier # NCT00882180). Thus
the translation potential of RNAi mediated blockade of
HCC is largely unexplored. Targeting tumor-specific
GAPDH could be achieved either by targeted-delivery
or selective-activation of si/shRNA in the tumor. The
targeted delivery is within the limits of loco-regional
therapies whereas selective activation involves a strategy
of molecular cloning. For instance, if the expression of
GAPDH-shRNA is regulated by the known marker of
HCC (the alpha-fetoprotein, AFP) it would enable us to
selectively target AFP-positive HCC. In such a scenario,
even if the GAPDH-shRNA inadvertently enters into
normal, non-cancerous cells, the toxicity will be prevented
as the silencing effect is under the control of the presence
of HCC marker, AFP.

Selective targeting of GAPDH

Future directions

The involvement of GAPDH in several mechanisms
that are associated with hepatocarcinogenesis (e.g. viral
hepatitis, metabolic alterations), and the sensitivity of
human HCC to targeted inhibition of GAPDH underscore
the therapeutic potential of inactivating GAPDH,
particularly in liver cancer. Next, the efficacy of targeted
inhibition and the necessity of preventing systemic toxicity
are the tasks to be achieved for clinical translation of such
anti-GAPDH approach.

Successful
translation
of
any
potential
chemotherapeutic for cancer essentially relies on the
molecular-specificity of the therapeutic agent and its
selectivity in targeting tumor. However, for liver cancer
such as HCC, there is an additional requirement that
needs to be fulfilled for successful practice in the clinics;
that is the potential new drug candidates must exhibit an
extremely favorable toxicity profile in order to preserve
the functionally normal liver. This necessity is due to the
fact that liver cancer typically arises in the context of an
underlying liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis) making the liver
especially susceptible to any kind of therapeutic insult.
Thus ideal molecular targets will be those that are critically
required for cancer cell proliferation, chemoresistance and
metastasis. Since GAPDH is known to be involved in all
of these processes (Figure 5) it is an extremely attractive

Loco-regional therapies
Image-guided procedures, especially intra-arterial
therapies, play a key role in the treatment of patients with
liver cancer [10, 76]. The advantage of loco-regional
approaches is that it provides not only access to the core
but also to the periphery of the tumor. In addition, much

Identifying a specific inhibitor can be as difficult
as identifying the molecular-target. Based on our current
understanding of GAPDH and its functions, it is evident
that inhibition of either the glycolytic role or interference
with its non-glycolytic actions is sufficient to block
GAPDH. Akin to this, several motifs have been predicted
in the peptide sequence of GAPDH that can be attributed
to its multiple functions (Figure 6). Preclinical evaluation
of GAPDH inhibitors to date has been shown to inhibit its
glycolytic role. Whether such inhibitors affect the PTMs,
and their anticancer effects are PTM-inhibition dependent,
have yet to be proven. It certainly appears that PTM
remains an area that requires intense research especially
since the majority of the non-glycolytic functions of
GAPDH are affected by PTMs. For example it is known
that phosphorylation of the Thr 237 decreases the nuclear
translocation of GAPDH and blocks its apoptotic role
[82]. Presumably, screening and developing inhibitors
that would inhibit Thr 237 phosphorylation could restore
GAPDH’s-apoptotic role. Likewise, Akt2 kinase has
been documented to mediate phosphorylation of Thr
237. Hence inhibitors specific for Akt2 kinase could
support GAPDH dependent apoptosis. Interestingly,
another PTM, the O-GlcNAcylation of GAPDH at Thr
(227) has been shown to allow its nuclear translocation
to facilitate its non-glycolytic functions [83] suggesting
O-GlcNAcylation as a possible target. However, the
translational potential of such an anti-GAPDH approach
lies in the successful treatment of HCC in clinically
relevant experimental models. Hence, further research is
necessary in order to evaluate (a) the feasibility of delivery
of GAPDH-shRNA under Ultra-sound guidance to target
GAPDH in an orthotopic liver tumor model and (b) the
molecular specificity of AFP-dependent silencing of
GAPDH in HCC.
Recently, gene (silencing) therapy and / or antibody
based therapeutics have been shown to be very effective
in loco-regional therapies however, their selectivity in
targeting tumor cells and sparing normal hepatocytes
would require tumor cell-specific functional activation
of such therapeutics. This is plausible, if the functional
activation of such therapeutics is dependent on the
presence of a tumor-specific protein (e.g. AFP in some
cases of HCC). Preclinical studies in line with this
principle of tumor-specific functional activation have been
documented and further studies are required to evaluate
this selective silencing of GAPDH in HCC in relevant
models mimicking the clinical set-up (e.g. spontaneous
HCC, orthotopic liver tumor, image-guided therapy etc).
The failure of majority of the antimetabolites during
clinical translation may be attributed to the plasticity of
tumor cells where “alternative or complementary feeder
pathways” can substitute for the disrupted metabolism. In
other words, the complex network of tumor metabolism
demonstrates innate flexibility to overcome or withstand
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

disruption of any single biochemical pathway or inhibition
of any particular molecular target. Hence, concurrent
inhibition of complementary metabolic pathways (e.g.,
glycolysis, PPP, cellular redox balance) might prove to be
a vital therapeutic strategy.
In summary, “targeting early steps of glucose
metabolism (e.g. GAPDH activity) will enable us to
block intracellular energy production and other critical
pathways linked to it (e.g. macromolecular biosynthesis),
eventually causing cancer cell death”. Future research
focusing on the targeted (via loco-regional therapy) and
selective (e.g. 3-BrPA) inhibition of GAPDH would
provide us an opportunity to acquire better armamentarium
in treating HCC.
