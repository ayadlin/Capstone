BACKGROUND: Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) result in durable responses in patients with previously
untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Previous reports have suggested that in patients with relapsed CLL, a dose-intensified
rituximab regimen increases response rates in comparison with standard-dose rituximab. It is unknown whether rituximab intensification of the FCR regimen will result in improved response rates and patient outcomes in patients with previously untreated CLL.
METHODS: A single-arm study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a modified FCR regimen with multiple-dose rituximab (FCR3) in 65 patients with previously untreated CLL. The results were compared with those for a historical cohort treated
with FCR. RESULTS: The overall response rate to FCR3 was 97%, with 75% of the patients achieving a complete remission. Minimal residual disease negativity was achieved for 62% of the patients according to flow cytometry. The median time to progression (TTP)
was 81 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached, with 58% of the patients still alive at a median survivor followup of 9.7 years. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and major infections were observed with 45%, 5%, and
1.9% of the FCR3 courses, respectively. Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) or therapy-related acute myelogenous
leukemia (t-AML) developed in 7 patients (11%; P < .01 vs the historical FCR cohort). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with previously
untreated CLL, FCR3 resulted in response rates, TTP, and OS similar to those of a historical cohort of patients treated with FCR. FCR3

INTRODUCTION
The development of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has improved the outcomes of patients with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Combination chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC)
results in complete remission (CR) rates of up to 38% in patients with previously untreated CLL.1-3 In a phase 2
trial, the addition of rituximab to this regimen resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 95% and a CR rate of
70%.4,5 In a randomized phase 3 trial, the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR)
was associated with improved progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in comparison with FC in
treatment-naive patients with CLL.6
Single-agent rituximab has also been shown to have activity in both patients with treatment-naive CLL and patients
with relapsed CLL.7-9 Notably, the response rates for CLL are significantly lower than those seen for other indolent lymphoproliferative disorders such as follicular lymphoma.8 Possible explanations for this phenomenon include the relatively
low expression of CD20 on CLL cells10 and the altered pharmacodynamics in patients with CLL due to the high intravascular tumor burden.8 In the latter scenario, the large amount of circulating malignant CLL cells may lead to an antibody
sink, which causes rapid clearance of rituximab from the blood and leads to decreased efficacy.
In an effort to increase the response rate of single-agent rituximab in CLL, some investigators have used doseintensification strategies. A dose-dense regimen of rituximab given 3 times a week for 4 weeks at the standard dose of 375
mg/m2 resulted in an ORR of 45% in a cohort of mostly pretreated patients with CLL.11 In another trial, escalating doses
of rituximab, ranging from 500 to 2250 mg/m2, were given weekly for 4 weeks to previously treated patients with CLL.12
An ORR of 36% was achieved, and there was evidence of increased response rates in patients treated with higher rituximab

doses. In both of these studies, the dose-intensified rituximab regimens increased response rates in comparison
with those seen in historical controls, and they were associated with an acceptable toxicity profile.
Given improved response rates with dose-intensified
regimens of single-agent rituximab, we designed a trial to
investigate whether increasing the number of rituximab
doses given with FCR chemoimmunotherapy would
improve outcomes for patients with untreated CLL. The
results were compared with historical data for FCR. We
hypothesized that a modified FCR regimen with
multiple-dose rituximab (FCR3) would result in higher
CR rates without a significant increase in toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This phase 2 study was approved by the institutional
review board of The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center (MDACC) and was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00794820). All patients provided informed consent according to institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were
required to have progressive CLL with an indication for
treatment according to the National Cancer Institute
Working Group guidelines.13 Patients of all ages were eligible. All patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 3, a
serum creatinine level < 2 mg/dL, and a bilirubin level
< 2 mg/dL (unless renal or liver dysfunction was thought
to be due to organ infiltration by lymphocytes). Prognostic markers, including the presence or absence of
zeta-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (Zap-70) and the
immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene
mutation status, were determined, and standard metaphase cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed on bone marrow at
baseline for the majority of the patients.
Therapy

The FCR3 regimen consisted of six 28-day cycles of intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m2 per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2 per day) on days 2 to 4 for cycle 1
and on days 1 to 3 for cycles 2 to 6. For the first cycle, rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on day
1 and at a dose of 500 mg/m2 on days 2 and 3. For cycles
2 to 6, rituximab was administered at a dose of 500 mg/
m2 on days 1 to 3. Premedication for rituximab infusion
with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and/or steroids
was recommended and provided at the discretion of the
treating physician. Courses were delayed at the discretion

of the treating physician if this was needed to allow for
adequate recovery of neutrophil and platelet counts. Dose
reductions for FC, but not rituximab, were made if a
patient experienced a prolonged grade 3 or 4 hematologic
toxicity, infection, or organ dysfunction. Prophylaxis
against tumor lysis syndrome, herpes simplex virus (HSV)
reactivation, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP)
and myeloid growth factors were administered at the discretion of the treating physician.
Response Assessment

Patients were evaluated with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy and with 4-color flow cytometry for residual CD5- and
CD19-coexpressing lymphocytes with light-chain restriction
at the end of the third and sixth cycles and then every
12 months until evidence of disease progression. Minimal
residual disease (MRD) negativity was defined as <1%
CD5- and CD19-coexpressing cells with a normal j-k ratio;
this cutoff was standard at the time at which this trial was
conducted but differs from the recent consensus definition
for MRD negativity.14 Computed tomography scans were
not used for response assessment. Patients were evaluated for
responses according to the response criteria defined by the
National Cancer Institute Working Group.13
FCR Comparison Group

Patients enrolled at MDACC in a previously published
clinical trial of FCR for patients with untreated CLL were
used as a historical comparison group (n 5 300).4,5 The
median follow-up for the FCR cohort at the time of this
analysis was 119 months.
Statistical Considerations

The primary objective of this study was to determine the
CR rate with FCR3 for treatment-naive patients with
CLL. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the OS,
time to progression (TTP), ORR, MRD negativity rate,
and toxicity of the FCR3 regimen. TTP was defined as
the time from the initiation of treatment to primary refractory disease or CLL progression. TTP was censored
for therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) or
therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia (t-AML)
and death in remission. t-MDS/t-AML was diagnosed in
accordance with consensus guidelines.15 OS was defined
as the time from the initiation of treatment to the date of
last follow-up or death. The data cutoff for this analysis
was October 1, 2014. TTP and OS were calculated with
Kaplan-Meier estimates, and survival estimates were compared with the log-rank test. Responses were assessed by
pretreatment characteristics and compared with Fisher’s

Sixty-four of the 65 patients were evaluable for the assessment of the response to FCR3. Among the patients
evaluable for responses, the ORR was 97% (Table 2).
Forty-eight patients (75%) achieved a CR, 10 (16%)
achieved a nodular partial remission (nPR), 4 (6%)
achieved a partial remission (PR), and 2 (3%) did not
respond to FCR3. These response rates were not significantly different from the CR, nPR, and PR rates for
patients treated with FCR (72%, 10%, and 12%, respectively). As for the 2 patients whose CLL did not respond
to FCR3, the patient with a 17p deletion developed cytopenias from progressive CLL after 2 cycles of FCR3 and
died 6 months after study enrollment. The other patient,
whose chromosomal status was unknown, also developed
cytopenias due to CLL progression after 4 cycles of FCR3
and died of sepsis 7 months after study enrollment. One
patient died 2 months after study enrollment because of
sepsis after 3 cycles of therapy and was not evaluable for a
response.
Responses to FCR3 by pretreatment patient
characteristics are listed in Table 3. Only a pretreatment
b2-microglobuln level  3.8 mg/L was predictive of
achieving a CR (P < .01). No significant association was
found between CR rates and patient age, Rai stage, IGVH
mutation or Zap-70 status, or chromosomal abnormalities by FISH. The patient with a 17p deletion was the

CLL did not respond to FCR3.
Sixty patients were tested for MRD with flow
cytometry on bone marrow aspirate samples after 6 cycles
of therapy or after their last cycle of therapy if fewer than
6 cycles were administered (Table 2). Thirty-seven
patients (62%) had <1% CD5- and CD19-coexpressing
cells (MRD negativity), 14 patients (23%) had 1% to 5%
residual CLL cells, and 9 patients (15%) had >5% residual CLL cells by flow cytometry. Among the patients who
achieved a CR, 34 of the 46 evaluable patients (74%)
were negative for MRD. Among those patients who
became MRD-negative, the median time to the loss of
MRD negativity was 49.2 months. The MRD negativity
rate was not significantly different between patients
treated with FCR and patients treated with FCR3 when

with FCR; P 5 .19).
Response Duration and Survival

The median TTP for the entire FCR3 cohort was 81
months (Fig. 1A), which was similar to the historical FCR
population, which had a median TTP of 84 months (P 5
.63). The median TTPs for patients achieving a CR,
an nPR, and a PR were 86 months, 49 months, and
not evaluable, respectively (P 5 .14 for a CR vs an nPR;
Table 2 and Fig. 2). Sixteen patients (25%) were still alive
without relapsed disease at the time of this analysis. The
median TTP for patients with unfavorable chromosomal
abnormalities by FISH (ie, 11q deletion and/or 17p deletion) was 63 months, whereas it was 82 months for
patients who had favorable chromosomal abnormalities
or were negative according to FISH (P 5 .14; Fig. 3).
There was a trend toward prolonged TTP for patients
with mutated IGVH versus those with unmutated IGVH
(median TTP, not reached vs 74 months, respectively;
P 5 .09). No significant difference was observed in TTP
between patients who were MRD-negative and patients
who were MRD-positive when all patients were analyzed

administered was 5.5 (range, 2-6). The most common
cause of premature discontinuation of therapy was persistent cytopenia, which developed in 5 patients (8%). Other
reasons for discontinuation were resistant disease (n 5 2),
infection (n 5 3), hepatitis B reactivation (n 5 1), interstitial pneumonitis (n 5 1), persistent splenomegaly
requiring splenectomy (n 5 1; no CLL on pathology),
metastatic gastric cancer (n 5 1), and cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n 5 1).
Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed in 19%
and 26% of FCR3 cycles, respectively. Fifty-eight patients
(89%) experienced at least 1 episode of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and the median incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia per patient was 2 (range, 1-6). Growth factor
support with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) was provided to 41 patients (63%) during 1 or more
cycles. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in
5% of the courses. A total of 14 patients (22%) experienced at least 1 episode of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia.
No patients experienced major bleeding. Rates of grade
3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were not significantly different from those seen with FCR.
All patients received HSV prophylaxis with valacyclovir, which is standard practice at our institution.
Twenty-two patients (34%) received PJP prophylaxis
with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Minor infections
such as urinary tract infections, cellulitis, sinusitis, and
upper respiratory infections occurred in 14% of the
courses. Only 1.9% of the courses were associated with
major infections, including septicemia (n 5 5) and pneumonia (n 5 2). There were no cases of HSV or PJP infections. One patient developed hepatitis B reactivation after

cycle 4, which prompted treatment discontinuation. This
patient developed only a mild transaminase elevation and
responded well to antiviral medications.
Secondary Malignancies

t-MDS developed in 6 patients, and t-AML developed in
1 patient. t-MDS/t-AML occurred in 11% of study participants at a median of 32 months after the initiation of
FCR3 treatment (range, 22-92 months). In the historical
FCR cohort, t-MDS/t-AML developed in 2.7% of
patients (P < .01). The age at study enrollment was
62.7 6 4.2 years (mean 6 standard error of the mean) for
the patients who developed t-MDS/t-AML after FCR3
versus 58.6 6 1.3 years for the patients who did not develop t-MDS/t-AML (P 5 .30). Five of the 7 patients
received all 6 cycles of FCR3, and 2 patients received only
4 cycles. The mean number of cycles received by patients
who developed t-MDS/t-AML was not significantly different than that received by patients who did not (5.4 vs
5.6 cycles; P 5 .99). No difference was observed in the
baseline IGVH mutation status, abnormalities by FISH,
or number of courses associated with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia among those patients who developed t-MDS
/t-AML versus those who did not.
Six patients developed t-MDS/t-AML without
receiving any further chemotherapy (5 who had a CR and
1 who had a PR at the time of the t-MDS/t-AML diagnosis). None had a history of any prior radiation or cytotoxic
chemotherapy. The other patient developed t-MDS 7.5
years after study enrollment. This patient’s CLL progressed 4 years after the completion of 6 cycles of FCR3.
This patient was then observed for 1 year and was subsequently treated with rituximab and lenalidomide for 2.5
years before the development of t-MDS. All 6 patients
with t-MDS had deletions of all or part of chromosome 5
and/or chromosome 7, and the 1 patient with t-AML had
trisomy 8. The baseline karyotype was available for 5
patients who developed t-MDS/t-AML. None of these
patients harbored baseline cytogenetic abnormalities other
than those known to be associated with CLL. The median
OS for patients who developed t-MDS/t-AML was 10
months from the time of the t-MDS/t-AML diagnosis
(range, 3-21 months). All patients diagnosed with tMDS/t-AML had died at the time of this analysis.
Richter’s syndrome (RS) developed in 3 patients
(5%) at the time of disease progression. All of these
patients were in CR before the diagnosis of RS. One
patient developed RS 41 months after the initiation of
FCR3 and died 10 months after the RS diagnosis, and
1 developed RS 43 months after FCR3 and died 6 months
3874

later. The third patient was diagnosed with RS 105
months after FCR3 and was still alive at the most recent
follow-up 8 months after the RS diagnosis. There was no
significant difference between the RS rates for the FCR3
and FCR cohorts (3% in the FCR cohort; P 5 .61).
Malignancies other than t-MDS/t-AML and RS
developed in 6 patients (9%). Observed malignancies
included cutaneous anaplastic T-cell lymphoma, gastric
adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, and
squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, all of which
occurred in 1 patient each. The median time to the diagnosis of a secondary malignancy (excluding t-MDS/
t-AML and RS) was 14.7 months (range, 4.5-98.7
months).
DISCUSSION
Chemoimmunotherapy with a regimen such as FCR is
the standard of care for younger, physically fit patients
with previously untreated CLL.16 Nearly all patients
respond to FCR, and most achieve a CR, although the
majority of patients eventually develop relapsed disease.5
Patients who achieve a CR and those who are MRDnegative after FCR have a longer disease-free interval than
those who achieve lesser responses.5,17,18 In a large
randomized controlled trial, the addition of rituximab to
FC significantly increased CR and MRD negativity rates
and resulted in marked improvements in progression-free
survival and OS in comparison with FC alone in patients
with previously untreated CLL.6,17 In patients with
relapsed CLL, dose-intensified rituximab regimens
increase response rates in comparison with standard-dose
rituximab.11,12 This observation prompted our group to
evaluate the effect of a modified FCR regimen with multiple doses of rituximab in patients with previously
untreated CLL.
Despite prior reports of increased responses with
dose-intensified rituximab, FCR3 did not result in significant improvements in response rates, MRD negativity,
TTP, or OS in comparison with a historical FCR cohort.
It is possible that different mechanisms underlie the
increased efficacy observed with dose-intensified singleagent rituximab and that observed when rituximab is
combined with chemotherapy (eg, FCR vs FC). Because
of the relatively low CD20 expression on CLL cells,10
higher doses of rituximab may be needed to induce
adequate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity when
it is administered as a single agent. In contrast, rituximab
has been shown to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of
chemotherapy agents such as fludarabine,19-21 and this

synergism likely contributes to the efficacy of rituximabbased combination regimens for CLL in comparison with
chemotherapy alone. The lack of improved response rates
with FCR3 versus FCR suggests that when rituximab is
used in combination with chemotherapy, there may be a
ceiling beyond which higher cumulative doses of rituximab do not further potentiate the cytotoxic effects of the
backbone chemotherapy regimen.
The FCR3 regimen was well tolerated and had an
early safety profile comparable to that of standard FCR
chemoimmunotherapy, as previously reported.4 The majority of the patients (77%) received all 6 cycles of FCR.
Despite the increased doses of rituximab given in the
FCR3 regimen, the incidences of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and major infections were not increased. The
rate of RS was also similar to that seen in patients treated
with FCR.t-MDS/t-AML developed in 7 patients (11%)
who received FCR3 and accounted for 26% of all study
deaths. The development of t-MDS/t-AML was not associated with patient age or with the number of cycles of
FCR3 administered. The frequency of t-MDS/t-AML in
patients treated with FCR3 was 4-fold higher than that
observed in the historical FCR cohort (2.7%); this difference reached statistical significance. Our group at
MDACC previously reported a rate of t-MDS/t-AML in
patients treated with FCR-based therapy as high as 5.1%,
although notably this analysis included data from patients
treated with FCR3 as well as FCR plus concomitant
GM-CSF, both of which were associated with higher rates
of t-MDS/t-AML than FCR alone.22 Despite the significant increase in t-MDS/t-AML with FCR3, OS was not
decreased in comparison with that seen in the FCR
cohort.
It should be noted that definitive conclusions about
the relation between FCR3 and the development of
t-MDS/t-AML are precluded by the small sample size of
this study and the comparison with a historical control
group. To our knowledge, a statistically significant association between higher cumulative doses of rituximab and
the development of t-MDS/t-AML has not previously
been reported. The addition of rituximab to FC in the
CLL8 trial did not result in increased rates of t-MDS/
t-AML.23 Similarly, in a single-arm study of 67 patients
with CLL given rituximab maintenance after upfront
rituximab, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone, no cases of t-MDS/t-AML were reported after a
median follow-up of more than 4 years.24
In contrast, the addition of rituximab to high-dose
chemotherapy was associated with an increased rate of
solid tumors in patients with lymphoma in a large series.25

In this series, there was a numerically higher cumulative
incidence of t-MDS/t-AML in patients who received
rituximab, although this did not reach statistical significance. A randomized trial evaluating rituximab maintenance versus observation in patients with CLL after either
first- or second-line chemoimmunotherapy also suggested
an increase in secondary malignancies in the rituximab
maintenance arm versus the observation arm (6% vs
<1%), although the rates of t-MDS/t-AML were not
reported.26
The mechanism by which an increased cumulative
dose of rituximab might have caused the apparently
increased incidence of t-MDS/t-AML in the current study
is unclear. B cells have been shown to exert antitumor
effects through both antibody-mediated cytotoxicity of
malignant cells and antigen presentation to effector T
cells.27,28 It is, therefore, feasible that the immunosuppressive and B cell–depleting effects of rituximab might
impair immune surveillance and predispose patients to
secondary malignancies. Alternatively, rituximab might
potentiate the cytotoxic effect of the backbone FC chemotherapy on normal hematopoietic progenitors and predispose patients to secondary hematologic malignancies.19-21
It is also possible that frequent use of growth factors may
have played a role in the higher rate of t-MDS/t-AML in
the current study. In a previous trial, the routine addition
of GM-CSF to FCR resulted in a numerically higher rate
of t-MDS/t-AML in comparison with FCR alone (6% vs
3%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance.29 The use of growth factors in the historical
FCR cohort was not recorded, so our ability to draw conclusions about the role of growth factors in the development of t-MDS/t-AML is limited.
In conclusion, the addition of multiple doses of rituximab to FCR failed to significantly improve response
rates or long-term outcomes in patients with previously
untreated CLL. FCR3 had short-term toxicity similar to
that of FCR, although it resulted in an increased rate of
secondary hematologic malignancies. Further studies are
needed to evaluate this finding.
