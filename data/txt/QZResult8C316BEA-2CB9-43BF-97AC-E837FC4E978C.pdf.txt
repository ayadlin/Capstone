Abstract
Telomerase is considered an attractive anticancer target on the basis of its common and specific activation in
most human cancers. While direct telomerase inhibition is being explored as a therapeutic strategy, alternative
strategies to target regulators of telomerase that could disrupt telomere maintenance and cancer cell
proliferation are not yet available. Here, we report the findings of a high-throughput functional RNA interference
screen to globally profile the contribution of kinases to telomerase activity (TA). This analysis identified a
number of novel telomerase modulators, including ERK8 kinase, whose inhibition reduces TA and elicited
characteristics of telomere dysfunction. Given that kinases represent attractive drug targets, we addressed the
therapeutic implications of our findings, such as demonstrating how limiting TA via kinase blockade could
sensitize cells to inhibition of the telomere-associated protein tankyrase. Taken together, our findings suggest
novel combinatorial approaches to targeting telomere maintenance as a strategy for cancer therapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Telomerase is a ribo-nucleoprotein complex essential for
the maintenance of chromosome structure and function
[reviewed in (1)]. Telomerase adds de novo telomeric repeats
to chromosome termini, thereby ensuring the "capping" and
protection of chromosome ends and limiting termini erosion
due the end replication problem (1). In normal human cells,
telomerase activity (TA) is tightly regulated and is restricted
primarily to germline cells. As a consequence, telomeres
shorten at each round of cell division until they reach a critical
length, which triggers replicative senescence (1). It has been
proposed that replicative senescence acts as a barrier to
unrestricted cell proliferation and tumourigenesis (1). In
keeping with this model, most human immortal cell lines
and tumor cells bypass replicative senescence by activating
mechanisms to maintain telomeres (1). This occurs via activation of telomerase, or alternatively via a second mechanism

based on DNA recombination, ALT [alternative lengthening of
telomeres, (1)].
The minimal telomerase enzyme encompasses a catalytic
subunit (hTERT), an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase with
reverse transcriptase activity, and an RNA subunit (hTR),
which functions as template for the addition of telomeric
repeats to chromosome termini (1). TA is tightly regulated in
human cells and this regulation involves a number of protein
kinases (2). For example, hTERT is phosphorylated in vitro by
the kinase AKT (3, 4). Conversely, c-ABL kinase has been
identified as a negative regulator of TA (5). Members of the
protein kinase C (PKC) family also phosphorylate hTERT
in vitro, induce TA, and stimulate hTERT promoter activity
(6, 7). The kinase SRC acts as a negative regulator of TA by
phosphorylating hTERT in response to oxidative stress and
inducing its export from the nucleus (8). Several other kinases,
such as ERK1/2 and JNK, have also been linked to the
regulation of TA but the mechanisms underlying these effects
are still not clear (9, 10).
The almost universal presence of telomerase in human
cancers and its absence in most normal tissues make telomerase an attractive therapeutic target. Indeed several compounds that inhibit TA have been developed; however, the
clinical results with these drugs to date have been inconclusive
(11). As an alternative to direct telomerase inhibition, inhibition of proteins that modulate TA could be exploited in cancer
therapy. This could be achieved by targeting transcription
factors that mediate the expression of either telomerase
subunit, but this is pharmacologically challenging. Alternatively, targeting protein kinases that modulate TA could also
be used. Protein kinases are important mediators of signal
transduction and are involved in a wide variety of biological
processes. Moreover, the relative ease by which catalytic

inhibitors of kinases can be developed makes kinases attractive drug targets. To comprehensively profile the contribution
of kinases to telomerase regulation, we conducted a highthroughput RNA interference screen (HTS). We used a library
of siRNAs targeting kinases and kinase-associated genes and
measured the effects of kinase silencing on TA. This approach
identified a number of new modulators of TA, whose inhibition could be exploited as a means to target telomere
maintenance.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, siRNAs, plasmids, and compounds
HeLa, CAL51, MCF7, MCF10A, and MCF12A cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Human
foreskin BJ fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. Silvia
Bacchetti (IRE, Rome, Italy). The protein kinase siRNA library
(siARRAY) was obtained in 10 96-well plates from Dharmacon.
pCMV5-HA-ERK8 and pCMV5-HA-ERK8-D154A (HA-ERK8KD) containing, respectively, HA-tagged wild-type and kinasedead mutant ERK8 were kindly provided by Prof. Cohen
(University of Dundee, Scotland, UK; ref 12). pcDNA3-FlaghTERT was kindly provided by Prof. Chantal Autexier (McGill
University, Montreal, Canada). The siERK8-04–resistant cDNA
constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using
the Quickchange Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence in ERK8 targeted by
siERK8-oligo 4 (siERK8-04) is the following: CCUAUGGCAUUGUGUGGAAUU. Cell transfection, drug treatment, lentiviral
infection, and gene silencing validation methods are described
in the Supplementary Methods section.
BX795 was obtained from Axon Medchem and dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Ro318220 was obtained from
Calbiochem. XAV939 was obtained from Maybridge and dissolved in DMSO.
HTS method
HeLa cells were plated in duplicate 96-well plates and
transfected with the siRNA library (final concentration 100
nmol/L). After 5 days, cell viability was assessed using CellTiterGlo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (CTG; Promega) in
plate 1 and whole cell extracts were prepared from plate 2. For
the analysis of cell viability, the effect of each SMARTpool was
calculated by dividing the mean luminescence of each siRNAtransfected well by the mean luminescence of the siCtrltransfected wells in each plate.
To determine the overall assay quality and reproducibility,
Z scores were calculated using the surviving fractions from all
10 siRNA plates centered on the median and the standard
deviation estimated from all the plates. Z0 -factors between
negative control (siCtrl) and positive control [sihTERT (siRNA
targeting hTERT)] were calculated as reported (13), using Z' 
0.5 as a threshold of acceptable dynamic range.
Whole cell extracts and qTRAP
We optimized a 96-well–based method of whole cell
extracts suitable for the TRAP assay [Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol; (14)]. Briefly, cells in 96-well plates were

www.aacrjournals.org

scraped in a NP-40–based lysis buffer (15), incubated in ice for
15 minutes, transferred to a Multiwell Filter Plate containing a
0.2 mm Biolnert Filter (AcroPrep, VWR), centrifugated for 10
minutes at 4 C, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. After
quantifying the total protein concentration, 0.1 mg of whole
cell extracts were used for SYBR Green-based qTRAP according to reference (16). Standard curves were calculated for all
reactions with serial dilutions of HeLa extracts. As a negative
control, we used HeLa extracts heat-inactivated for 10 minutes
at 85 C and a lysis buffer only control. Relative telomerase
activity (RTA) was calculated using the average Ct of the 3
replicas for each sample with the following formula RTA ¼ 10
(Ct sample-Yint)/slope, where Yint, the intercept on the y-axis
and the slope were derived from the standard curve (16). The
RTA for each siRNA was normalized to RTA of the siCtrl cells.
Immunofluorescence and FISH
For immunofluorescence, cells were treated with hypotonic
solution for 5 minutes (0.25% Triton, 20 mmol/L Hepes, 50
mmol/L NaCl, 3 mmol/L MgCl2 in H20), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15
minutes, treated with ice-cold methanol for 20 minutes, and
blocked in PBS with 5% FBS.
Telomere dysfunction–induced DNA damage foci (TIF)
were detected by the colocalization of 53BP1 (BP13, 1/200,
Upstate Cell Signaling) and telomeric-repeat binding factor
(TRF1; 1/300, Abcam). Nuclei were counterstained with 40 ,6diamidino 2 phenylindole (DAPI) and cells were analyzed
using a confocal fluorescence microscope. At least 50 cells
for each experiment in at least 3 independent experiments
were scored. Statistical differences were analyzed with
the unpaired t test, using the online GraphPad QuickCalcs
software.
Metaphase spreads were prepared as previously reported
(17) and hybridized with a telomeric FITC-labeled probe
(DAKO), counterstained with DAPI and processed according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent signals were
visualized with a confocal fluorescent microscope.
Telomere length analysis
Genomic DNA was prepared using the QIAamp DNA Blood
Minikit (Qiagen). Telomere length was measured using a realtime PCR–based method, qTRF (18). For each population the
TRF length was normalized to the length of sh-NS cells and
differences between controls and ERK8-silenced populations
were calculated using the unpaired t test. For differences in
TRF over time, the TRF length of each population was normalized to that of the early population doubling and statistical
differences between early and late time-points were analyzed
with the paired t test.

Results
To identify novel determinants of TA in human cells, we
conducted a HTS in a telomerase-positive human tumor cell
line, HeLa (Fig. 1A). We used a human SMARTpool siRNA
kinase library. In this library, each well contained 4 distinct
siRNA species (SMARTpool) targeting a single gene. HeLa

high-efficiency transfection, as measured by the ability of
siRNA targeting the essential gene, PLK1 (polo-like kinase 1),
to cause more than 80% reduction in cell viability compared

method that was compatible with the qTRAP assay (see

Following optimization, the screen was conducted twice. Z
scores for viability between the replica screens were highly
reproducible (r2 ¼ 0.7783; Fig. 1B). Moreover, the dynamic
range of the screen was estimated using the performance of
the negative (siCtrl) and positive (sihTERT) controls used in
the TRAP assay and was acceptable in both replicas with Z' ¼
0.5 in each replica (19).
To account for the differing effects of each SMARTpool on
cell viability and to minimize nonspecific effects on TA due to
significant cell death, only SMARTpools that caused less than
50% reduction in viability compared with control-transfected
cells were analyzed by qTRAP. To further increase the specificity of the screen, we set stringent threshold values for TA in
candidate selection; those kinases whose inhibition reduced
TA below 35% of TA in the siCtrl cells were considered
potential positive regulators, whereas those that increased
TA above 150% of the controls were considered potential
negative regulators. Of all the siRNAs analyzed by qTRAP (480
siRNAs), about 1/5 were hits in both replica screens using
these criteria (109 kinases out of 480 analyzed; see Supplementary Table S1).
Internal validation of the screen was provided by the
observation that siRNAs targeting SRC (v-SRC sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog), a negative regulator of telomerase (8),
significantly increased TA (see Supplementary Fig. S1A). In a
similar fashion, siRNAs targeting PRKCQ (protein kinase C
theta), a positive regulator of telomerase (6), significantly
decreased TA (see Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Annotation of the hits from the screen identified 2 main
groups modulating TA: (i) mitotic kinases involved in the
spindle formation and the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as
aurora kinase B (AURKB), NEK [NIMA (never in mitosis)related kinase] family members, CCRK (cell-cycle–related
kinase), and (ii) MAP kinase super-family members, including
members of the ERK1/ERK2 pathway as well as members of
the JUNK/p38 MAPK pathway, such as ERK1/2, MAP3K4,
MAP2K7, MAPKAPK5, and ERK8 (MAPK15).
Of the novel modulators of TA identified, we selected a
subset of 26 (see Supplementary Tables S1, genes in bold;
and S2) for further analysis. Since the main aim of this work
was to identify novel modulators of telomerase and ultimately novel targets for cancer therapy, we selected a
number of kinases not previously implicated in telomerase
regulation. Candidates were also selected where several
members of the same sub-family were represented among
the hits, perhaps supporting their involvement in regulating
telomerase. Among the mitotic kinases selected were
AURKB, NEK2, and NEK7. AURKB is an important regulator
of mitosis involved in chromosome alignment and spindle
assembly checkpoint, is frequently overexpressed in human
cancers and has been pursued as a target for anticancer
therapies (20–22). AURKB has also been shown to modulate
telomerase via Survivin (23). NEK2 and NEK7 belong to the
NEK family of kinases, of which 5 members were present
among the hits. There is now substantial evidence that
NEK2, NEK6, NEK7, and NEK9 regulate mitotic progression
and mitotic spindle organization (24). Furthermore, high
expression levels of NEK kinases have also been found in

3332

Cancer Res; 71(9) May 1, 2011

human cancers, such as breast and bladder cancers (25, 26)
and NEK kinases are now being pursued as potential therapeutic targets (27, 28). Members of the MAPK superfamily
were also selected given their diverse functions in a wide
variety of biological processes (9, 29). Other kinases previously unconnected to telomere maintenance that were
further analyzed include ERK8, a new member of the MAPK
family whose expression is upregulated in colorectal and
other cancers (30, 31; see Supplementary Table S2). As
controls we analyzed the kinases PRKCQ and SRC (2).
Using this selected gene subset, we first repeated the
original screen assay to confirm the initial results and filter
out aberrant observations common in HTS (see Supplementary Fig. S1B). Of the 26 original hits, 13 showed a similar
effect to the original HTS and were selected for further
analysis. To validate the specificity of the observed phenotypes and minimize "off-target" effects, we repeated the HTS
assay using each individual siRNA present in the SMARTpools targeting the selected hits (32). For most of the kinases
analyzed at least 2 of 4 siRNAs within the SMARTPools
modulated TA, replicating the effects observed in the HTS
(Fig. 1C and D). To confirm that the reduction in TA was
associated with silencing of the target kinases, we carried
out qPCR to quantify mRNA levels or western blotting to
estimate protein expression of the target genes (see Supplementary Fig. S2).
To eliminate the possibility of identifying effects particular
to HeLa cells, we assessed the ability of siRNAs to modulate TA
in additional cell lines. We selected 2 telomerase-positive cell
lines, CAL51 and MCF7, which are amenable to high-efficiency
siRNA transfection. The majority of siRNAs had comparable
effects on TA in both MCF7 and CAL51 cells as those observed
in HeLa cells (Fig. 1E and F).
Mechanisms of modulation of TA
TA is tightly regulated in human cells and several proteins
have been implicated in its regulation (2). We assessed
whether the kinases identified in the screen modified the
transcription of hTERT or hTR (33). We found that silencing
of MAPKAPK5 or ERK8 significantly reduced hTERT mRNA
levels compared with siCtrl-transfected cells (Fig. 2A),
effects that correlated with a marked decrease in TA in
the qTRAP (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Conversely, knockdown of SRC resulted in a significant induction of hTERT
mRNA, consistent with the upregulation of TA in the qTRAP
assay and also a proposed model whereby SRC acts as a
negative regulator of telomerase. Interestingly, siRNAs targeting PRKCQ, which has been proposed to activate the
promoter activity of hTERT in T lymphocytes (6), did not
significantly affect hTERT mRNA levels. However, the use of
different cell line models could explain this difference. For
the other kinases analyzed we found that silencing did not
significantly affect hTERT mRNA levels (Fig. 2A), suggesting
that these genes most likely regulated TA via some other
mechanism. We also measured the levels of hTR upon
silencing of the selected kinases by qPCR and found that
none of the siRNAs analyzed significantly affected hTR levels
(see Supplementary Fig. S3).

siRNA Screen for Modulators of Telomerase Activity

Targeting the kinase activity of ERK8 affects TA and
causes telomere dysfunction
ERK8 is a rather poorly characterized MAPK, but does
appear to be regulated by DNA damage and some activated
oncogenes (31, 36, 37). Recently, it has been shown that
ERK8 promotes the neoplastic transformation and progression of colorectal cancer (30). In addition, ERK8 expression
appears to be elevated in various types of human cancers,
including lung, pancreatic, and ovarian tumors (31, 38).
ERK8 knockdown had the strongest effect among the
kinases analyzed on the formation of TIFs and a dramatic
effect on TA, which suggested that ERK8 might be a specific
and potent regulator of telomerase. Initially we noted that
inhibition of ERK8 in 2 telomerase-negative cell lines did not
induce TIFs, in contrast to the observations made in telomerase-positive cells (see Supplementary Fig. S4B), providing some support to the hypothesis that the effects of ERK8
on telomere function were mediated via an effect on telomerase. Subsequently, we investigated whether the catalytic
activity of ERK8 was required for modulation of TA. To
achieve this, we used a combination of siRNA-mediated
targeting of the endogenous ERK8 gene together with recapitulation of ERK8 expression. We introduced siRNA-insensitive HA-ERK8 or HA-ERK8-KD cDNA constructs into cells
in which ERK8 levels were reduced by siRNA (see Supple-

Modulation of telomerase via kinase silencing causes
telomere dysfunction
One of the cellular consequences of telomerase inhibition is
telomere dysfunction due to uncapped telomeres, which result
in the formation of DNA damage–induced foci localized at the
telomeres [TIFs (34, 35)]. TIFs can be identified by the
colocalization of a telomeric-specific protein, such as TRF1,
and a DNA damage-associated protein, such as 53BP1.
To investigate whether modulation of the selected kinases
caused telomere disturbances, we measured the presence of
TIFs by monitoring the colocalization of TRF1 and 53BP1 by
immunofluorescence. We found that silencing of kinases
that elicited a reduction in TA also caused an increase in the
percentage of cells containing TIFs, whereas silencing of
kinases that had no effect on TA did not (Fig. 2B and D),
supporting the hypothesis that perturbing TA via kinase
modulation could result in telomere dysfunction. Specifically, targeting of ERK8 or PRKCQ resulted in a high percentage of cells containing multiple TIFs (2–5 TIFs/cell; 23%
and 18% of cells with TIFs in siERK8- and siPRKCQ-transfected cells vs. 7% in siCtrl-cells; P < 0.001). siRNAs targeting
of AURKB, PNKP, NEK2, MAPKAPK5, and MAP2K7 induced
more moderate yet significant increases in cells containing
multiple TIFs (each effect P < 0.05 compared with siCtrlcells), whereas MAPK1, NEK7, and MAP3K4 silencing
increased the percentage of cells containing 1 or 2 large
TIFs (11.2, 15, and 14.4% vs. 7%; P < 0.05). Of the kinases
analyzed, only MAPK3 knockdown did not significantly
increase TIFs. A similar increase in the number of cells
containing TIFs was also observed using multiple individual
siRNAs for ERK8 and MAPKAPK5 (see Supplementary
Fig. S4A).

comparable to siCtrl-transfected cells, whereas reconstitution of the kinase-dead mutant ERK8 did not (Fig. 3A),
suggesting that ERK8 kinase activity is essential for TA
regulation. Moreover, introduction of the kinase-dead
ERK8 in siCtrl-transfected cells reduced TA, reminiscent
of a dominant-negative effect and supporting the hypothesis
that ERK8 activity is essential for TA regulation. Furthermore, introduction of hTERT cDNA construct restored TA in
ERK8-silenced cells, suggesting that the effect of ERK8 on TA
acts via hTERT (Fig. 3A).

ERK8 modulation of telomerase, we investigated whether
prolonged ERK8 silencing could affect telomere length over
time. To examine this, we infected MCF7 cells with 4 lentiviruses expressing sh-RNAs targeting ERK8 or a control,
nontargeting sh-RNA (sh-NS). After puromycin selection, we
assessed ERK8 silencing and TA. Of the 4 sh-RNA used, E8-72
did not affect ERK8 levels or any of the other parameters
analyzed, whereas 2 sh-RNAs, E8-1294 and E8-1846, elicited a
significant reduction in ERK8 expression, correlative reduction
in TA and a mild decrease in hTERT mRNA levels (Fig. 4A and B,
and data not shown). Moreover E8-1294 and E8-1846 also
induced TIFs (19% and 22% of cells with TIFs in sh-E8-1294
and sh-E8-1846-infected cells vs. 8% in sh-NS cells, P < 0.01;

Fig. 4C and D). The increase in TIF frequency was restored to
basal levels by the introduction of a wild-type but not a kinasedead ERK8 cDNA, confirming that these effects were specific
for ERK8 kinase activity, similar to the effect on TA in HeLa
cells (Fig. 3B). A final sh-RNA construct, E8-486, induced a
marked albeit not significant reduction of ERK8 levels, but this
did not result in any effect on TA; we assume that the silencing
of ERK8 with this sh-RNA did not reach a critical threshold
required to affect telomerase function.
To determine the effect of ERK8 modulation on telomere
length, we used the qTRF assay (18). Compared with sh-NS
infected cells, populations with significant ERK8 silencing (shE8-1294 and sh-E8-1846) had shorter telomeres (Fig. 4E). More

importantly, whereas sh-NS infected populations and populations in which ERK8 silencing was not profound maintained
stable telomere lengths over time, sh-E8-1294 and sh-E8-1846infected cells showed significant telomere shortening (Fig. 4F),
indicating that inhibiting telomerase via ERK8 silencing
affected telomere maintenance.
Finally, we examined the presence of telomere fusions in
cells with ERK8 silencing, but were unable to detect major
differences between the control and siERK8-transfected cells
(see Supplementary Fig. S6). Nevertheless, the ability of
ERK8 silencing to elicit a reduction of TA, an increase in

TIF frequency and a reduction in telomere length together
confirmed the status of ERK8 as a telomerase modulating
enzyme.
Chemical inhibition recapitulates the phenotypes of
ERK8 silencing
We also investigated the potential for recapitulating the
phenotypes observed using silencing of ERK8 with small
molecule inhibitors. While clinical inhibitors of ERK8 do
not yet exist, 2 experimental inhibitors have been described

specificity: BX795 and Ro318220 (12, 39). BX795 was originally
described as a PDK1 inhibitor, but also inhibits the catalytic
activity of ERK8 with similar potency to PDK1 inhibition (39).
Ro318220 was developed as a PKC inhibitor, but also inhibits
auto-phosphorylation of ERK8 at similar concentrations used
to inhibit PKC (12).
We treated HeLa cells with BX795 or Ro318220 for 24 hours
before testing the effects on viability, TA, and TIFs formation.
At the concentrations used, neither compound affected cell
viability but both compounds caused a significant reduction of
TA compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover,
both compounds elicited an increase in the frequency of cells
containing TIFs compared with vehicle alone, suggesting that
chemical inhibition of the catalytic activity of ERK8 mirrored
the phenotypes observed with siRNA (Fig. 5B and C).
Given the therapeutic potential of modifying ERK8 activity
in tumor cells, we also analyzed the effects of ERK8 inhibition
in nontumor cells. For this purpose, we treated 2 telomerasepositive noncancerous cell lines, MCF10A and MCF12, as well
as a primary cell line, BJ, with BX795 and Ro318220 (Fig. 5D
and E). We found that treatment with either inhibitor did not
impair cell viability in normal cells, giving further support for
the clinical potential of ERK8 inhibition.

Combinatorial targeting of ERK8 silencing and
tankyrase induces cell death
The main limitation of targeting telomerase as an anticancer approach is the lag time between initial telomerase
inhibition and crisis, which could limit efficacy and foster the
development of drug resistance (40–42). As such combinatorial therapeutic approaches that involve telomere dysfunction
might be more successful. We investigated whether inhibition
of TA-modulating kinases could synergize with agents that
targeted telomere maintenance via a separate mechanism. We
selected a tankyrase inhibitor, XAV939, which has been shown
to inhibit tankyrase 1 and 2 (43). Tankyrase is a shelterin
component (44), whose inhibition enhances the effects of
telomerase inhibition (45, 46). As expected XAV939 did not
significantly affect TA, but caused an increase in cells containing TIFs (see Supplementary Fig. S7), in keeping with the role
of tankyrase in controlling telomere maintenance (46).
We transfected HeLa cells with siRNAs targeting ERK8,
treated them with XAV939 and measured clonogenic survival.
Silencing of ERK8 dramatically increased sensitivity to
XAV939 (Fig. 6A; Table 1), suggesting that modulation of
telomerase function via inhibition of ERK8 could synergize
with anticancer therapeutics that impact on other aspects of

telomere maintenance. To give further support to these
results, we combined XAV939 with small molecule ERK8
inhibitors. We found that the combination of XAV939 with
either BX795 or Ro318220 was significantly synergistic with
combination indexes (CI) below 0.7 (47; Fig. 6B and C; Table 2).
These results confirmed our observations with the siRNAs and
suggested that combining inhibition of targets that regulate
telomere maintenance via different mechanisms (i.e., ERK8
that modulates TA and tankyrase which affects, at least in
part, telomerase access to telomeres) could have a synergistic
effect on cell viability.
To understand whether silencing of the other kinases
identified in the screen would also synergize with XAV939
treatment, we transfected HeLa cells with siRNA targeting
these kinases and then assessed XAV939 sensitivity (Fig. 7). Of
the genes tested, silencing of AURKB and NEK7 strongly
increased sensitivity to XAV939 in a similar fashion to
ERK8, whereas MAPK1 knockdown had a significant, although
less marked, effect (Fig. 7A; Table 3). These results highlighted
the potential of our screen to identify novel telomerase
modulators for targeting telomere maintenance and may
support a new rationale for the development of novel telomere-based anticancer approaches.

Discussion
Telomere maintenance is an essential pre-requisite for
unlimited cell proliferation and tumourigenesis. Indeed, more
than 85% of human cancers activate telomerase to maintain
telomeres (48, 49). Inhibiting telomerase results in telomere

shortening and eventually crisis and cell death due to dysfunctional telomeres (40–42). Telomerase is, therefore, an attractive target for the development of cancer therapies. Several
compounds that inhibit telomerase have been developed as
potential cancer therapeutics, but to date these have had only
limited clinical success (11). As an alternative, the inhibition of
telomerase regulators could also be used to target telomere
maintenance in tumor cells. Here we describe a high-throughput siRNA screen to identify novel modulators of telomerase
that could be used as potential therapeutic targets. Given the
pharmacological tractability and involvement in a plethora of
signaling processes, we selected kinases and functionally
profiled their ability to modulate TA. In doing so we identified a number of novel effectors, involving kinases with no
previous association with telomere biology. Several kinases
that had been previously shown to regulate telomerase were
also among the hits, confirming the specificity of the functional read-out of the HTS (6–8). Moreover several of the
identified kinases have been found overexpressed in different human cancers and are now being exploited as potential
targets for cancer therapeutics (20–22, 25–29). Subsequent
validation experiments showed that modulation of some of
these proteins resulted in perturbation of telomerase function and elicited phenotypic changes characteristic of telomere dysfunctions, suggesting that the proteins identified in
our screen are likely true modifiers of telomerase. Although
the molecular mechanisms underlying many of these observations remain to be elucidated, we have showed that
silencing of ERK8 or MAPKAPK5 can impair the expression
of hTERT mRNA, perhaps explaining at least in part their
effect on TA. It is possible that these kinases directly regulate
hTERT expression though there is no previous evidence in
the literature for their direct involvement in transcriptional
regulation; alternatively they might act indirectly by modulating the activity of other factors that in turn regulate
hTERT expression (2).
We examined ERK8 in more detail because it had the
strongest effect on telomerase function. We showed that
inhibition of this rather poorly characterized MAPK kinase,
not only affected telomerase function at the telomeres, but also
synergized with compounds such as XAV939, which inhibits
the telomere-associated binding protein poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase tankyrase. More importantly from a therapeutic
point of view and contrary to what we observed in cancer cells,
inhibition of ERK8 did not noticeably affect viability or induce

Importantly, the effects of the combination of kinase inhibition (in this case of ERK8) with other compounds that also
target the telomeres (such as XAV939) suggest that this
approach may hasten crisis and reduce the potential problems
associated with the lag time between telomerase inhibition
and eventual cell death. We also noted that XAV939 treatment
synergized with silencing of other TA-modifying kinases
including AURKB, NEK7, and MAPK1; each of these kinases
is pharmacologically tractable and as such expands the range
of approaches that could eventually be used in future therapeutic strategies.
We do note that other studies have used RNAi screening
with the same siRNA platform to identify telomerase regulators, most notably by looking at modulators of telomerase
expression rather than activity (50). One such study identified
GSK3B as a regulator of telomerase expression and showed
that targeting this protein strongly affected cell proliferation
as well as telomere length, providing a link between the Wnt
pathway and telomere maintenance (50). Our results complement and extend this previous study by analyzing the effects of

modulating kinase activity on TA and ultimately telomerase
function at the telomeres.
In summary, our data identify several novel regulators of TA
that modulate telomere maintenance. More importantly,
modulation of telomerase functions by these regulators can
be used to sensitize tumor cells to other anticancer therapeutics that impact at least in part on telomere maintenance.
Our data have important clinical implications and suggest a
new rationale for the development of novel mechanism-based
anticancer approaches.
