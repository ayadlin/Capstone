ABSTRACT
Recently we have shown that the transcription factor FOXO1, highly expressed in
B cells, is downregulated in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). As primary mediastinal
B cell lymphoma (PMBL) has similarities with the cHL transcription program we
investigated FOXO1 expression in this entity. By using immunohistochemistry we
found that FOXO1 was absent or expressed at low levels in 19 of 20 primary PMBL
cases. PMBL cell lines reproduce the low FOXO1 expression observed in primary
cases. By analyzing gene expression profiling data we found that FOXO1 expression
inversely correlated with JAK2 in PMBL cases. Targeting JAK2 activity by the small
molecular weight inhibitor TG101348 resulted in upregulation of FOXO1 mRNA and
protein expression in MedB-1 and U2940 cell lines, and the MYC inhibitor 10058-F4
increased FOXO1 mRNA in MedB-1 cells. Moreover, in MedB-1 cells FOXO1 expression
was strongly upregulated by the inhibitor of DNA methylation 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine
and by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Since FOXO1 promoter was
unmethylated, this effect is most likely indirect. FOXO1 activation in the FOXO1negative MedB-1 cell line led to growth arrest and apoptosis, which was accompanied
by repression of MYC and BCL2L1/BCLxL. Thus, FOXO1 repression might contribute
to the oncogenic program and phenotype of PMBL.

INTRODUCTION

such as cardiomyopathy after high anthracycline doses and
mediastinal irradiation, further investigation of the PMBL
oncogenic program to find specific molecular targets is
warranted.
The oncogenic program of PMBL is similar to
that of cHL. Both entities rely on constitutive activation
of JAK-STAT and NF-κB signaling [3]. The genomic
amplifications on 9p and 2p16 involving JAK2 and REL
genes, respectively, are recurrent features of PMBL and
cHL [4, 5]. Furthermore, suppressor of cytokine signaling

PMBL is a distinct subtype of diffuse large B cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) sharing several morphological and
molecular similarities with classical Hodgkin lymphoma
(cHL). It comprises about 2% of NHL and preferentially
affects young females [1]. Although PMBL belongs to
the most curable lymphoma subtypes [2], delayed late
complications of chemo- and radiotherapy remain a main
challenge. With respect to complications of chemotherapy

1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of JAK/STAT signaling,
is recurrently mutated in both entities leading to increased
phosphorylation of the JAK2 downstream targets STAT5
and STAT6 [6]. STAT transcription factors, in turn,
induce transcription of genes responsible for proliferation
and survival including MYC and BCLxL/BCL2L1[7]. In
addition, JAK2 and histone demethylase KDM4/JMJD2C
can directly activate MYC transcription in PMBL and cHL
cell lines [8].
Despite these similarities, PMBL principally differ
from cHL, e.g. in terms of maintenance of major parts of
the B cell differentiation program. The characteristic trait
of cHL is almost complete loss of the B cell phenotype,
whereas PMBL express most of the B cell-specific
transcription factors including POU2AF1/BOB.1/
OBF1, POU2F2/OCT2, PU.1, PAX5, BCL6 and B cell
surface differentiation markers CD19, CD20, and CD79a
[9]. However, PMBL like cHL typically lacks surface
immunoglobulins [10].
Recently, we have shown that the forkhead O
family transcription factor FOXO1, which is highly
expressed in B cells, is downregulated in Hodgkin and
Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of cHL. Interestingly, all
NHL subtypes tested including follicular lymphoma,
marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL, marginal
zone B lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell
lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma expressed FOXO1
protein at levels comparable with those of normal B
cells [11]. FOXO family transcription factors have been
shown to act as tumor suppressors regulating expression
of proapoptotic and antiproliferative genes [12]. FOXO1
plays a critical role in establishing and maintaining the
B cell specific differentiation program, but it is also

responsible for cell death due to an inappropriate BCR
signaling [13, 14]. The best-studied mechanism of FOXO
inactivation is phosphorylation followed by nuclear
export and proteolytic degradation. AKT, ERK, and IKK
kinases are known to phosphorylate FOXO proteins
thereby contributing to cell proliferation and survival
[15-18]. Constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT and ERK
pathways is typical for many lymphoma subtypes [19,
20]. In addition, FOXO1 mutations were detected in 7%
of all NHLs [21] and in 8.6% cases of DLBCL. These
mutations did not influence FOXO1 mRNA and protein
levels [22]. In cHL high expression of specific miRNAs,
chromosomal deletions, and constitutive activity of
AKT and ERK signaling pathways contribute to almost
complete repression of FOXO1 [11].
Considering that PMBL resembles cHL in various
aspects, we asked whether it also expresses low levels of
FOXO1 and which role FOXO1 might play in PMBL.
By using immunohistochemistry we found that most
PMBL cases were either low or negative for FOXO1. We
identified FOXO1 as a tumor suppressor in PMBL and
revealed mechanisms responsible for its repression.

RESULTS
FOXO1 is repressed in PMBL
To clarify the expression status of FOXO1 in PMBL
we analyzed 20 clinically and morphologically validated
PMBL cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC). In 15%
of cases FOXO1 was absent, in 80% of cases only weak
staining was observed, and one case (5%) was scored
as strongly positive (Figure 1A). Further, we measured
expression of FOXO1 mRNA in an independent PMBL
cohort and in two samples of CD19+ cells isolated from
hyperplastic human tonsils (Figure 1B). The expression
of FOXO1 mRNA in PMBL samples significantly
varied but in all cases it was substantially lower than in
normal tonsillar B cells. There is a scarcity in cell lines
representing PMBL, the only three available cell lines
are MedB-1, Karpas1106, and U2949. We therefore
analyzed FOXO1 expression in these three PMBL cell

Objective: Plan-Neofluar 40×/0.75 NA. (B) FOXO1 mRNA
expression is downregulated in PMBL cases. RNA was isolated
from CD19+ tonsillar cells and from frozen PMBL cases, and
FOXO1 expression was measured by Q-RT-PCR and analyzed
by delta Ct method. Here and in all other Q-RT-PCR experiments
the house keeping gene RPL13A was used as reference and the
data are shown as mean±SD of at least 2 independent Q-RT-PCR
runs that included 3 technical replicates each.

lines using Q-RT-PCR, immunoblot, and IHC (Figure
2). The levels of FOXO1 mRNA in all PMBL cell lines
were significantly lower than in CD19+/CD10+ tonsillar
cells representing the germinal (GC) population (Figure
2A). The highest FOXO1 mRNA levels were detected in
Karpas1106, followed by U2940 and MedB-1. Of note,
FOXO1 mRNA expression levels in Karpas1106 and
U2940 cells were similar to that in PMBL cases with
highest FOXO1 levels, whereas expression of FOXO1 in
MedB-1 cells was somewhat lower than in PMBL cases
with lowest expression (Figure 1B and Figure 2A). The
FOXO1 protein levels in the PMBL cell lines correlated
well with the mRNA data. Karpas1106 expressed the
highest and MedB-1 expressed the lowest levels of
FOXO1 (Figure 2B). To further corroborate similarities
between clinical PMBL cases and cell lines we also used
IHC to analyze FOXO1 expression in paraffin embedded
pellets of the cell lines (Figure 2C). The cell lines matched
well to three groups of primary PMBL tumors which were
identified on the basis of FOXO1 expression: FOXO1
negative - MedB-1, weakly positive - U2940, and strongly

positive Karpas1106.

Contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors to
FOXO1 repression in PMBL
To clarify the genetic mechanisms of FOXO1
repression we first sequenced both FOXO1 exons in all
three PMBL cell lines (Figure S1). We did not find any
missense mutations in the transcribed region and the
promoter region of FOXO1. Next, we analyzed publically
available human genome tiling array data from 31 PMBL
cases [28]. We found five samples with copy number
aberrations affecting FOXO1 but none of them was limited
to FOXO1 locus. Specifically, we found one sample with
a single allele loss of FOXO1 and four cases displaying
a single allele gain, which was based on trisomy in two
cases. Therefore, FOXO1 copy number aberrations
in PMBL are biased to gains rather than to losses and
therefore do not contribute to FOXO1 downregulation in
this lymphoma subtype (Table S1).
Epigenetic factors are often involved in repression

Figure 3: Epigenetic factors contribute to FOXO1
silencing. (A, B) PMBL cells were seeded at a density of 2×106

cells in 10 ml of complete culture medium and incubated for
24h with 5-aza-dC at a concentration of 1 µM. The cells were
then washed and cultured in complete medium without 5-azadC. After 72h, cells were harvested and used for analysis of
FOXO1 mRNA and protein expression by Q-RT-PCR (A) and
by immunoblot (B). One of three independent experiments
that yielded similar results is shown. The Q-RT-PCR data were
analyzed by delta Ct method. (C) MedB-1 cells were treated
with graded concentrations of TSA for 24h. FOXO1 protein
expression was analyzed by immunoblot. (D) Ectopic FOXO1
activation induces transcription of endogenous FOXO1 in MedB1 cells. MedB-1 stably expressing inducible variant of FOXO1
(FOXO1ER) or empty vector (EV) were treated with 4-OHT at
concentration of 200 nM. 24h later expression of endogenous
FOXO1 was measured with help of Q-RT-PCR using primers
targeting 3´-UTR. One of three independent experiments that
yielded similar results is shown. The data were calculated by
comparative Ct method using RPL13A as reference gene.

three samples of each cell line. (B) Expression of FOXO1 protein

at different time points of culturing are shown. All immonoblot
analyses yielded similar results. (C) FOXO1 expression in

of tumor suppressor genes. To test the contribution of
DNA methylation to the FOXO1 repression we treated
PMBL cell lines with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
5-aza-dC. We observed an increase of the FOXO1 mRNA
levels in all cell lines with highest upregulation in MedB1 cells (6.6 fold) whereas in Karpas1106 and U2940
FOXO1 levels were only slightly increased (1.9 and
2 fold, respectively) (Figure 3A). Interestingly, 5-azadC increased expression of FOXO1 on protein levels
only in MedB-1 (Figure 3B), but not in Karpas1106 and
U2940 cell lines (data not shown). Given that histone
deacetylation can also be responsible for gene silencing,
we treated MedB-1 cells with the histone deacetylase
inhibitor TSA. In fact, TSA treatment resulted in a dose
dependent increase of FOXO1 protein levels (Figure
3C). Finally, to find out whether the positive effect of
5-aza-dC on FOXO1 expression can be explained by
hypermethylation of the FOXO1 promoter, we analyzed
the methylation status of 26 CpG-dinucleotides located
in the vicinity of the transcription start site (Figure S2).
Surprisingly, the MedB-1 promoter was unmethylated like
in normal B cell subtypes (data not shown), suggesting that
5-aza-dC and TSA affect FOXO1 expression indirectly.

The absence of promoter methylation indicated “open”
chromatin structure of the FOXO1 promoter in MedB1 cells. To clarify whether this assumption is true, we
overexpressed a constitutively active mutant of FOXO1
fused in frame with the estrogen receptor ligand-binding
domain (FOXO1ER) in MedB-1 cells. We measured the
expression level of endogenous FOXO1 mRNA due to
the fact that FOXO1 promoter harbors FOXO binding
motifs and is regulated in a positive feed-back loop
manner in normal cells [29]. Stimulation with 4-OHT for
24 h increased the levels of FOXO1 mRNA 8.3 fold in
comparison with non-treated control. Thus, the FOXO1
promoter has functionally “open” chromatin structure
and can be activated by unknown epigenetically silenced
transcription factors. Taken together, our results suggest
that down-regulation of FOXO1 is not due to genetic
aberrations in PMBL. Additionally, epigenetic events may
play an indirect role in FOXO1 repression.

Figure 4: JAK2 and MYC contribute to FOXO1 repression in PMBL. (A) FOXO1 expression negatively correlates with MYC

and JAK2 mRNA levels in PMBL samples. The data of 31 PMBL cases were mined from GEO database (GSE11318). We used following
probe sets for correlation analysis: FOXO1 - 202724_s_at; JAK2 - 205842_s_at; MYC - 202431_s_at. The criteria for the chosen probe
sets are described in “Material and Methods”. The data are shown as log2 of fluorescence intensity. Expression of MYC (B) and JAK2 (C)
in PMBL cell lines was measured by Q-RT-PCR. The data are shown as ratio to the reference gene RPL13A. (D) Expression of JAK2 and
MYC protein in PMBL cell lines was analyzed by immunoblot. JAK2 and MYC expression was normalized to MedB-1 cells. (E). PMBL
cell lines were treated for 24 h with the JAK2 inhibitor TG101348. FOXO1 expression was measured by Q-RT-PCR and by immunoblot.
Statistical analysis was done by a two-way t-test. FOXO1 expression in the control group was compared with groups treated with increasing
concentrations of the inhibitor. For immunoblot ACTB was used as a loading control. To control repression of JAK2 activity we used
anti-phospho-STAT6 antibody. (F) PMBL cell lines were incubated with the MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 for 24h. FOXO1 expression was
measured by Q-RT-PCR. The data were analyzed by comparative Ct method.

FOXO1 expression in PMBL is regulated by a
complex network including JAK2 and MYC

a positive correlation was observed at the protein level
where the highest expression of both genes was detected
in MedB-1 cells (Figure 4B,C,D). Like in PMBL primary
cases, expression of FOXO1 inversely correlated with
expression of MYC and JAK2 in PMBL cell lines
(Figure 2A,B and Figure 4B,C,D). Thus, PMBL cell
lines are similar to original tumors in terms of FOXO1,
JAK2, and MYC expression. Since JAK2 and FOXO1
correlated negatively, we investigated whether inhibition
of JAK2 activity is able to increase FOXO1 levels. The
physiological effect of JAK2 inhibition was controlled by
analyzing the phosphorylation status of STAT6, a known
JAK2 target in PMBL [32].
In all cell lines treatment with JAK2 inhibitor
mildly increased FOXO1 mRNA expression (Figure
4E). Interestingly, this weak transcriptional upregulation
resulted in upregulation of FOXO1 protein level in
MedB-1 and U2940, but not in Karpas1106 cell line.
The efficiency of JAK2 inhibition by TG101348 was
proven by a concentration-dependent decrease of STAT6
phosphorylation in all cell lines (Figure 4E). Given
reciprocal interactions between MYC and FOXO1 we
asked whether MYC downregulation might also increase
FOXO1 expression. We found that the small molecular
weight inhibitor 10058-F4 induced a significant and dosedependent upregulation of FOXO1 mRNA specifically
in MedB-1 cells (Figure 4F). Taken together our results
suggest that the JAK2/MYC axis contributes to FOXO1
repression in PMBL.

We hypothesized that FOXO1 down-regulation
in PMBL may result at least in part from transcriptional
repression. To find factors that might be responsible for
the repression of FOXO1, we mined available GEP data
of 31 PMBL cases to identify genes whose expression
negatively correlates with FOXO1 expression (Table S2).
Among these genes was JAK2. Given that JAK2 inhibition
blocks FOXO1 nuclear export [30] and due to the critical
role of JAK2 in survival and proliferation of PMBL and
cHL cell lines [8] we used correlation analysis to prove
the correlation between FOXO1 and JAK2 expression. We
actually found a significant negative correlation between
JAK2 and FOXO1 in PMBL samples (Figure 4A). Since
JAK2 maintains proliferation of PMBL and cHL cell
lines by induction of MYC [8], we also investigated
correlation between these genes. In fact, we found a
positive correlation between MYC and JAK2 (Figure
4A). Given reciprocal interactions between FOXO1
and MYC [31], we assessed their expression and found
a significant negative correlation (Figure 4A). Next, we
asked whether the correlations between FOXO1, JAK2,
and MYC expression, found in primary PMBL tumors also
holds true in PMBL cell lines. Therefore, we measured the
mRNA and protein expression levels of these three factors
in MedB-1, Karpas1106, and U2940 cells by Q-RT-PCR
and by immunoblot. The expression of MYC and JAK2
positively correlated at the mRNA level in all cell lines
confirming the results from the primary cases. Moreover,

FOXO1 is a tumor suppressor in PMBL

were only moderately affected (Figure 6A,B). Expression
of BCL2L1 protein was also strongly downregulated
(Figure 6B), while BCL6 was upregulated. (Figure
6C,B). Therefore, repression of MYC and BCL2L1 might
contribute to the tumor suppressor effects of FOXO1 in
PMBL.

To investigate the functional role of FOXO1
repression in PMBL we overexpressed a constitutively
active inducible variant of FOXO1 (FOXO1ER) in the
FOXO1 negative cell line MedB-1 (Figure 5A). Activation
of FOXO1 by 4-OHT led to a decrease of cell viability in
comparison to untreated control. 4-OHT did not influence
proliferation of MedB-1 cells expressing empty vector
(Figure 5B). The decrease of viable cells can be explained
by a block of proliferation due to accumulation of cells
in G1-phase (Figure 5C). FOXO1-induced cell death
was associated with activation of caspase 3 (Figure 5D
and Figure S3). Therefore, FOXO1 repression in PMBL
contributes to the maintenance of the oncogenic program
in this lymphoma type.

DISCUSSION
We found that FOXO1 is downregulated at both the
mRNA and protein levels in PMBL. In 95% of PMBL
cases analyzed by IHC FOXO1 expression was low or
absent, and in all samples analyzed by Q-RT-PCR FOXO1
mRNA was expressed at substantially lower levels than in
normal B cells. Several functional mechanisms including
repression by JAK2 and MYC, as well as deregulation of a
positive feedback mechanism regulating FOXO1 promoter
activity, contribute to FOXO1 repression in PMBL.
Activation of FOXO1 in MedB-1 cells led to growth
arrest and apoptosis which was associated with repression
of the protooncogene MYC and the antiapoptotic protein
BCL2L1 (Figure 6D).
PMBL is similar to cHL in molecular aspects [3, 4].
Therefore, downregulation of FOXO1 in PMBL provides
additional evidence of the close similarities of cHL and
PMBL oncogenic programs. At the same time our finding
raises the question of heterogeneity of PMBLs. Although
virtually all PMBL expressed FOXO1 mRNA and protein
at lower levels than normal B cells, there were substantial
differences among primary cases and cell lines. In PMBL
complete repression of FOXO1 was observed only in 15
% of cases, whereas only 3% of the cases were FOXO1positive in cHL [11]. The observed heterogeneity in
FOXO1 expression is in line with reported morphologic
and molecular differences among PMBL cases [35,
36]. Of note, this heterogeneity cannot be explained by
genetic aberrations. We did not find FOXO1 mutations
in PMBL cell lines. We have proved that chromosomal
aberrations are not responsible for FOXO1 repression
in PMBL, therefore our data are in line with the recent
next-generation sequencing study which also did not
reveal FOXO1 genetic aberrations in 10 primary PMBL
cases [37]. Epigenetic silencing is certainly involved
in FOXO1 repression in some cases of PMBLs but it is
likely to play an indirect role because we were not able

FOXO1 activation represses genes responsible for
proliferation and survival in PMBL
Given that proliferation of PMBL depends on
expression of the protooncogene MYC [8], and that
constitutive JAK-STAT activation is responsible for
expression of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2L1 [33] in
PMBL, we analyzed the effect of FOXO1 on expression
of MYC and BCL2L1 in MedB-1 cells. As a control
for physiological effects of FOXO1 we measured the
expression of the known direct FOXO1 target gene BCL6
[34]. FOXO1 activation almost completely abolished
MYC protein expression, although MYC mRNA levels

to detect methylation of the promoter CpG-island in the
FOXO1-negative cell line. Interestingly, although FOXO1
is frequently repressed in different tumor types, promoter
hypermethylation has never been observed by other
studies [38, 39].
We identified JAK2 as a factor contributing to
FOXO1 repression in PMBL. The ability of JAK2 to
repress FOXO was shown in different cellular models.
In neuronal cells JAK2 activation led to nuclear export
of FOXO1 [30]. Mechanistically, the repression of
FOXO1 can be explained by activation of PI3K-AKT
and ERK pathways by JAK2 [40]. This, in turn, results
in phosphorylation, nuclear export, and degradation of
FOXO transcription factors [17, 41]. It is conceivable that
the upregulation of FOXO1 protein by the JAK2 inhibitor
is due to repression of FOXO1 inactivating pathways. The
increase in FOXO1 transcription by repression of JAK2
and the negative correlation between JAK2 and FOXO1
mRNA expression in PMBL samples might be explained
by positive autoregulatory feedback loop controlling
FOXO1 transcription [29].
We further observed that a small molecular weight
MYC inhibitor reactivates FOXO1 transcription in the
FOXO1-negative cell line MedB-1. Considering that
MYC was shown to compete with FOXO3 for PUMA,
GADD45A, and p27/CDKN1B promoters [15, 42], it is
conceivable that MYC can also interfere with FOXO1
binding on the FOXO1 promoter thus disrupting a positive
autoregulatory mechanism.
FOXO transcription factors simultaneously activate
numerous proapoptotic and antiproliferative pathways.
Therefore it is hard to determine single factors responsible
for FOXO-induced cell death and growth arrest [15]. In the
present study we analyzed only FOXO targets which are
known to play a critical role in the maintenance of PMBL.
We found that FOXO1 represses the protooncogene
MYC and inhibitor of apoptosis BCL2L1 in MedB-1
cells. FOXO proteins were shown to repress MYC at the
mRNA and protein levels by induction of miR-145, miR34b, and miR-34c [43, 44]. In addition, FOXO3 inhibits
MYC protein stability by decreasing phosphorylation
[45]. Given that FOXO1 activation in MedB-1 cells
led to strong inhibition of MYC protein but relatively
mild reduction of MYC mRNA level, the inhibition of
translation and protein stability might be critical.
BCL2L1 is an indirect repression target of FOXO
proteins. FOXO4/AFX protein induced death of HeLa
cells through upregulation of BCL6, the repressor of
BCL2L1 [46]. Considering that FOXO1 strongly activated
BCL6 protein expression, this mechanism might contribute
to BCL2L1 repression in MedB-1 cells. Interestingly,
expression of BCL2L1 in GC-DLBCL (bcl6+/CD10+/-/
MUM1-/CD138-) was significantly lower than in non-GCDLBCL (bcl6-/CD10-/MUM1+/CD138-)[47].
We have shown that FOXO1 repression contributes
to the maintenance of PMBL and that constitutive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression of JAK2 and MYC is involved in FOXO1
downregulation. We identified the protooncogene MYC
and the antiapoptotic gene BCL2L1 as FOXO1 repression
targets in PMBL.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell lines, chemicals, and treatments
PMBL cell lines MedB-1, Karpas1106, and U2940,
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% FCS, glutamine, and antibiotics as described [23].
MedB-1 cells stably expressing a constitutively active
form of human FOXO1 in-frame with the modified
tamoxifen-specific version of the murine estrogen
receptor-α ligand-binding domain (FOXO1-ER) were
established by infection with pCFG5-FOXO1(A3)ER
retroviral vector followed by selection with 100 μg of
zeocin as we described earlier [11]. Control cells were
transduced with empty pCFG5-IEGZ vector. FOXO1ER
construct was induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)
(Merck Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) at a final
concentration of 200 nM. The small-molecular weight
MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 was obtained from SigmaAldrich (Steinheim, Germany). The JAK2 inhibitor TG
101348 was obtained from Axon Medhem (Groningen,
The Netherlands); 5-aza-dC and TSA were purchased
from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany).

DNA methylation and mutational analysis
For analysis of the methylation status of the FOXO1
promoter CpG island we used pyrosequencing [11]. The
mutational status of FOXO1 coding exons was analyzed
by direct sequencing as we described earlier [11].

Cell death and proliferation analysis
Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using
annexin V-PE and 7-amino-actinomycin D co-staining
[11]. For cell-cycle analysis we used PI staining [11].

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated and first strand cDNA was
synthesized as described [11]. Samples were amplified
with help of IQ™SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD,
Munich, Germany) using LightCycler 480 real-time
PCR instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany). We used following primer sets: FOXO1:
5´-tggacatgctcagcagacatc-3 and 5´-ttgggtcaggcggttca-3´;
FOXO1 3´-UTR: 5´- cccattgtgtgttgaaatcc-3 and 5´-ttgcttt

cagtctcca-3´; JAK2: 5´-tttggcaacagacaaatgga-3´and 5´-g
caggaagctgatgcctatc-3´. Annealing temperature was
60 ºC for all primers. Primer sequences were identified
using Genscript online software (www.genscript.com,
12.08.2013). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by
biomers.net (Ulm, Germany).

Correlation analysis of FOXO1, MYC, and JAK2
expression
The data were mined from GEO database
(GSE11318;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/,
10.08.2013). To analyze FOXO1 expression we used the
probe set 202724_s_at. In our pilot experiments we found
that FOXO1 expression levels in B-cell lymphomas and
B cell subtypes (GEO data set GDS3516, 18.02.2011)
assessed with help of 202724_s_at and 202723_s_at
probe sets perfectly correlated with the results of our
Q-RT-PCR, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry in
the relevant tissues [11]. We have chosen 202724_s_at
probe set because it had highest Jetset score (overall score
0.443). The scoring is based on assessment of specificity,
coverage of all transcripts, and probability of transcription
of target [27]. The MYC probe set 202431_s_at we used
was the only true MYC probe set on Affymetrix Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (overall score 0.328).
JAK2 is represented by two probe sets 205842_at and
205841_at. Both JAK2 probe sets revealed a statistically
significant negative correlation between FOXO1 and JAK2
expression. When we assessed correlation between MYC
and JAK2 expression both probe sets revealed a positive
correlation, but only 205842_at yielded statistically
significant results and was chosen for analysis. Statistical
significance of the correlation was measured by Statistics
Calculators software (http://www.danielsoper.com/
statcalc3/calc.aspx?id=44; 13.08.2013).

Immunoblot
Immunoblot was done as described earlier [24]. The
following primary antibodies were used: anti-FOXO1
rabbit # 2880 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA);
anti-MYC rabbit sc-788 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Heidelberg, Germany); anti-JAK2 sc-278 (Santa Cruz);
anti-beta-Tubulin ab6046 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK); antiactin rabbit A5060 (Sigma-Aldrich). As second antibody
we used goat anti–rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2004; Santa Cruz).
Signals were visualized using the SuperSignal West Dura
extended-duration substrate (Thermo Scientific).

Human material, immunohistochemistry
Twenty cases of PMBL were included in this study.
Lymphoma diagnosis was in accordance with the current
World Health Organization classification [10]. As control,
we used samples of non-neoplastic tonsils. All PMBL
samples were drawn from our archive of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissues and pseudonymized to comply
with the German law for ethical usage of archival tissue
for clinical research (Deutsches Ärzteblatt 2003; 100
A1632). Approval for these studies was obtained from
the University of Ulm ethics board. The CD19+ tonsillar
cells and B-cell subtypes were isolated as described earlier
[25]. For immunostaining, deparaffinized tissue sections
were heat-denatured in a pressure cooker and incubated
with rabbit monoclonal antibody against FOXO1 used
for immunoblot (1:25 dilution). Bound antibody was
labeled using EnVision System (Dako, Jena, Germany).
Peroxidase activity was visualized by the substrate
3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (0.1 mg/mL in 0.17 M sodium
acetate, pH 5.2 plus 0.01% H2O2). The images were
acquired as described earlier [11].
