ABSTRACT
Oncoprotein CIP2A a Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A forms an “oncogenic nexus”
by virtue of its control on PP2A and MYC stabilization in cancer cells. The expression
and prognostic function of CIP2A in different solid tumors including colorectal
carcinoma, head & neck cancers, gastric cancers, lung carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma,
esophageal cancers, pancreatic carcinoma, brain cancers, breast carcinoma,
bladder cancers, ovarian carcinoma, renal cell carcinomas, tongue cancers, cervical
carcinoma, prostate cancers, and oral carcinoma as well as a number of hematological
malignancies are just beginning to emerge. Herein, we reviewed the recent progress
in our understanding of (1) how an “oncogenic nexus” of CIP2A participates in the
tumorigenic transformation of cells and (2) how we can prospect/view the clinical
relevance of CIP2A in the context of cancer therapy. The review will try to understand
the role of CIP2A (a) as a biomarker in cancers and evaluate the prognostic value
of CIP2A in different cancers (b) as a therapeutic target in cancers and (c) in drug
response and developing chemo-resistance in cancers.

INTRODUCTION

background”.
Cancerous
Inhibitor
of
PP2A,
CIP2A
(Recommended name: Protein CIP2A; Alternative
name(s):p90 autoantigen) is a human onco-protein [2].
The basic structure of CIP2A is shown in Figure 1A. As
an integral protein, CIP2A functions via protein binding
through interactions with many proteins including PP2A,
(a tumor suppressor), MYC, (a pleiotropic transcription
factor; MYC proto-oncogene protein, a class E basic
helix-loop-helix protein 39; Transcription factor p64),
polo like kinase (PLK1), and NIMA (Never In Mitosis
Gene A)-related kinase 2 (NEK2) protein. CIP2A
[(Q8TCG1 (CIP2A_HUMAN) Reviewed, UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot Last modified May 14, 2014. Version 90)]
has been reported to have binary interactions with MYC
(MYC proto-oncogene protein; Entry: P01106) and
PPP2R1A (serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 65
kDa regulatory subunit A alpha isoform; Entry:P30153)
(Binary interactions provide information about binary
protein-protein interactions. The data presented in this
section are a quality-filtered subset of binary interactions
automatically derived from the IntAct database). CIP2A

The unharnessed growth and metastasis of a tumor
mass [1] is initiated either by a single and/or by a number
of sequential multiple genetic triggers, the cumulative
effects of which are known to manifest through certain
discrete common growth promoting signaling pathways
of cells. The entire course of growth and metastasis of
cancer as a disease, is realized through simultaneous and/
or successive deleterious genetic changes affecting a wide
range of cellular functions either inside the cell itself (e.g.
from DNA damage repair to antigen response) and /or
outside the cell (e.g. from angiogenesis to the dissolution
of matrix proteins). Thus the entire sequence of events of
the growth and metastatic evolution of a tumor, although
unique to each patient from the standpoint of its oncogenic
events, course of growth, drug/radiation response and the
development of resistance to drug/radiation is attributed
to the long-lasting consequence of the genetic changes
either in their oncogene(s), tumor suppressor(s) genes, or
oncogenic transcription factors, which either singularly
or collectively setup each patient’s “oncogenic stage/

wherein the interacting target(s) are FLT1 (Vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 1 Isoform Iso 2), MYC
, and PPP2R1A (Source: neXtProtBETA).
An “oncogenic nexus” of CIP2A refers to the
interconnected regulatory network of CIP2A which is
established either through direct (binary) interactions of
CIP2A or indirectly through interactions of the CIP2APP2A duo with either multiple key cellular proteins/
transcription factors (onco-proteins like RAS, betacatenin, c-SRC; tumor suppressors like PP2A, p53;

transcription factors like MYC, E2F1, ETS1, ATF2, FLT1,
CHK1) or with components of key oncogenic pathways
(pathways like the PI3K-mTOR pathway, the RAS-MEKERK pathway, the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway) [3-10].
CIP2A by virtue of its functional interactions with a wide
number of oncogenesis related proteins and transcription
factors forms the major constituent of “oncogenic nexus”.
The central event of the “oncogenic nexus” constitutes
the close and reciprocal functional interactions between
CIP2A, c-MYC and PP2A which fine tunes the balance
between the function of an oncogenic transcription factor,

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the basic structure of CIP2A (A) and the mode of interaction of CIP2A with
c-MYC and PP2A (B). The “oncogenic nexus” of CIP2A is primarily constituted of the interactive functional network between oncogenic

transcription factors, tumor suppressors and different signaling components of the PI3K-mTOR pathway, the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway and
the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway. Schematic representation of the major interacting partners of “oncogenic nexus” involving CIP2A protein
has been compiled from Puustinen, P., 2014; Perrotti, D. and Neviani, P., 2014; Li, Y., 2013; Khanna, A., 2013; Laine, A., 2013; Niemela,
M., 2012; Westermarck, J. and Hahn, W. C. 2008; Junttila, M. R. and Westermarck, J. 2008; Junttila, M. R. et al., 2007. Bi-directional

c-MYC and a tumor suppressor, PP2A [11]. PP2A [2, 12,
13] constitutes one of the major tenets of the “oncogenic
nexus” of CIP2A. CIP2A by itself does not constitute
the “oncogenic nexus”; rather it forms the unique and
irreplaceable component of the nexus. The major role of
CIP2A in the “oncogenic nexus” is imparted to its control
over another important component of the nexus, PP2A.
CIP2A controls oncogenic cellular signals by
suppressing tumor suppressor PP2A [2, 12, 14]. Hence
understanding the molecular structure, the function and the
regulation of PP2A is crucial to envisage the “oncogenic
nexus” of CIP2A [15]. CIP2A binds to PP2A and inhibits
its phosphatase functions resulting in tumorogenic
transformation of cells. PP2A has been identified as
a protein involved in regulating c-MYC expression
[11]. CIP2A stabilizes c-MYC towards oncogenic
transformation. MYC is regulated by CIP2A via PP2A.
Niemelä et al., have shown that depletion of certain PP2A
subunits reverses CIP2A siRNA effects on both MYC
and proliferation [16]. CIP2A interacts directly with
c-MYC, inhibits PP2A activity toward c-MYC serine 62,
and thereby prevents c-MYC proteolytic degradation. As
serine 62 of MYC is an established PP2A target regulated
by CIP2A, it appears that CIP2A functions towards MYC
are similar to CIP2A´s functions towards other PP2A target
proteins. Thus CIP2A controls oncogenic transcription in
tumor cells and the “oncogenic nexus” of CIP2A protein in
human malignancies is executed through the stabilization
of MYC protein involving PP2A. From the oncogenesis
point of view, these changes converge on the oncogenic
upregulation of the RAS-MAPK and the PI3K-mTOR
pathways which help to transform cells [1, 15, 17]. PP2A
and MYC dependent interactions of CIP2A which form
the major components of the “oncogenic nexus” are shown
in Figure 1B. The global effect of CIP2A on oncogenesis
can be explained by CIP2A-mediated inhibition of PP2A
and its consequent effects on a number of oncoproteins,
tumor suppressors and transcription factors. Studies from
multiple laboratories have so far demonstrated that CIP2A
effects on regulating proliferation, migration, MYC and
E2F1 are reversed by simultaneous PP2A inhibition.
There are also a number of PP2A-independent
functions of CIP2A including (1) regulating the stability,
localization and activity of PLK1 [18] (2) enhancing
NEK2 kinase activity to facilitate centrosome separation
[19] and (3) increasing self-renewal of neural progenitor
cells [20]. Kim et al., reported that CIP2A depletion
delayed mitotic progression, resulting in mitotic
abnormalities independent of PP2A activity and CIP2A
interacted directly with the polo-box domain of PLK1
during mitosis [18]. One of the studies that reported a PP1and PP2A-independent function of CIP2A demonstrated
the involvement of CIP2A in cell cycle progression
through centrosome separation and mitotic spindle
dynamics. Jeong et al., on the basis of their yeast twohybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, demonstrated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that NIMA (never in mitosis gene A)-related kinase 2
(NEK2) is a binding partner for CIP2A [19]. CIP2A
exhibited dynamic changes in distribution, including the
cytoplasm and centrosome, depending on the cell cycle
stage in their study. Upon CIP2A depletion, centrosome
separation and the mitotic spindle dynamics were
impaired, resulting in the activation of spindle assembly
checkpoint signaling and ultimately extension of the cell
division time. This data can explain higher mitotic rates
observed in many tumor cells upon an upregulation of
CIP2A function as observed in several other studies. Their
data implied that CIP2A strongly interacts with NEK2
during G2/M phase, thereby enhancing NEK2 kinase
activity to facilitate centrosome separation in a PP1- and
PP2A-independent manner [19]. In breast cancer cells, a
positive feedback loop between CIP2A and E2F1 had been
shown to define the cell-intrinsic senescence sensitivity
[21]. Laine et al., showed that E2F1 overexpression, due
to p53 or p21 inactivation, promotes expression of human
oncoprotein CIP2A which in turn by inhibiting PP2A
activity, increases stabilizing serine 364 phosphorylation
of E2F1. Khanna et al., identified a novel functional link
between DNA damage kinase CHK1 and regulation of
the onco-protein CIP2A [22]. The clinical relevance
of CIP2A as a CHK1 effecter protein was validated in
several human cancer types including neuroblastoma
where CIP2A was identified as an N-MYC-independent
prognostic factor [23]. The role of JNK2/ATF2 in CIP2A
regulation was first reported from Kallunki laboratory
[24]. In the following years Zhao et al., also demonstrated
that Helicobacter pylori enhanced CIP2A expression
(mRNA and protein levels) and cell proliferation via
JNK2/ATF2 signaling leading to malignant transformation
in human gastric cancer cells [25]. The expression of
CIP2A has been regulated both via several transcription
factors as well as through downstream effectors of
classical growth promoting steroid hormones dependent
mitogenic pathways as reviewed in detail elsewhere [15].
Considering the close and overlapping functional ties
between the CIP2A and PP2A, it is possible that many
of CIP2A actions are directly or indirectly mediated via
PP2A. Further experimental evidence is indeed required
to provide convincing evidence for the PP2A-independent
function of CIP2A which will implicate a better and
clearer understanding of the complexity of CIP2A function
and its functional relationship to PP2A. Thus future studies
are warranted to prove whether these examples of CIP2A
functions (“E2F1 regulation” and “as CHK1 target”) are
functionally linked to PP2A or are independent of PP2A
function.
The magnitude of the extent of involvement of
CIP2A in the overall process of oncogenesis in different
organ type can be envisaged by a recent article from Danish
Cancer Society Research Center (Copenhagen, Denmark)
who identified the regulatory circuit involving CIP2A and
mTORC1 (as shown in Figure 1B) in tumor cells [26]. In
4583

Oncotarget

CIP2A in Cancers

their article Puustinen P et al., demonstrated that CIP2A
associates with mTORC1. Through this interaction, CIP2A
acts as an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1-associated
PP2A (PP2A negatively regulates mTORC1), thereby
enhancing mTORC1-dependent growth signaling and
inhibiting autophagy. Using ribonucleic acid interference
screens for autophagy-regulating phosphatases in human
breast cancer cells, they have identified that CIP2A acts
as a key modulator of mTORC1 and autophagy. This
regulatory circuit is reversed by ubiquitination and
p62/SQSTM1-dependent autophagic degradation of
CIP2A and subsequent inhibition of mTORC1 activity.
An autophagic degradation of CIP2A upon mTORC1
inhibition leads to destabilization of c-MYC. In line with
(a) CIP2A’s reported ability to protect c-MYC against
proteasome-mediated degradation [27] and (b) mTORC1’s
capability to integrate information regarding the
availability of nutrients and energy to coordinate protein
synthesis and autophagy [28-31], this evidence that CIP2A
is functionally connected to the enhancement of mTOR
function rationally strengthens the argument that CIP2A
forms a dominant part of the oncogenic transformation in
cells. In fact, Puustinen P et al.’s data not only characterize
CIP2A as a distinct regulator of mTORC1 and reveals
mTORC1-dependent control of CIP2A degradation as
a mechanism that links mTORC1 activity with c-MYC
stability to coordinate cellular metabolism, growth, and
proliferation but also provides a strong evidence for the
rationale that CIP2A as an oncopropein has the capability
to control major aspects of a tumorogenic transformation
of a cell. The complexity of the nexus is further amplified
due to the involvement of mTORC, which negatively
regulates PP2A activity [32-35] and studies by Li et al.,
detected increased PP2A activity in cancer cells exposed
to rapamycin [35].
It is intriguing how the interactions of CIP2A
(“oncogenic nexus”) with all different cellular
components/signaling molecules function in complex
co-ordinated ways to (1) enhance the activity of oncoproteins, (2) suppress the function of tumor suppressors,
(3) stabilize pro-oncogenic transcription factors, (4)
facilitate the function of other transcription factors
and / or (5) control cell growth, protein synthesis and
autophagy through growth factors, nutrients, energy
sensors and mTORC1 which eventually signals towards
oncogenic transformation of a cell. This review presents
an “oncogenic nexus” of CIP2A involving PP2A and
c-MYC in [2, 36] different cancers. The review describes
the role of the PP2A-CIP2A oncogenic nexus in different
organ type cancers and evaluates the clinical relevance of
CIP2A “oncogenic nexus” in the context of therapeutic
intervention.

CIP2A is overexpressed at a high frequency in a
number of tumors and expression levels are independent
markers for long-term outcomes in many of these tumors.
There are reports of changes in the expression of CIP2A
in both solid tumors and Myelodysplastic Syndromes. In
solid tumors, CIP2A (mRNA or protein) has been shown
to be amplified / overexpressed and these expression levels
either correlated significantly with tumor stages or served
as an independent prognostic marker for disease-free
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Interestingly
the changes in the expression levels were also found to be
tumor cell specific. CIP2A is rarely present (low levels) in
non-transformed/non-malignant cells while in a typically
transformed cell, CIP2A is present in abundance [37].
Supplementary Table 1 lists the reported of changes in
CIP2A levels and its role in different cancers. Recently
miR-375 has been reported to activate p21 and suppresses
telomerase activity by coordinately regulating HPV E6/
E7, E6AP, CIP2A and 14-3-3ζ in HPV-positive cancers
[38] . In their study Jung et al demonstrated that miR-375mediated repression of CIP2A, E6, E6AP and E7 occurs in
HPV16-positive cells that simultaneously increases tumor
suppressor p53, p21 and RB and causes cell cycle arrest.

CIP2A in Colorectal Cancers
Wiegering et al., reported that CIP2A influences
survival in colon cancer patients and is critical for
maintaining MYC expression. CIP2A mRNA was
amplified / overexpressed in colon tumor samples and
CIP2A expression levels correlated significantly with
tumor stage. They demonstrated that CIP2A serves
as an independent prognostic marker for disease-free
and overall survival [39]. Studies by Bockelman et al.
reported that CIP2A overexpression is associated with
c-MYC expression in colorectal cancer [40]. In another
study Cristobal et al., reported that PP2A is frequently
inactivated in patients with colorectal cancers indicating
that PP2A represents a potential therapeutic target for this
disease and its restoration using FTY720 shows promising
therapeutic potential [41]. In their study a PP2A activator
FTY720 impaired proliferation and clonogenic potential
of cells, induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, affected
AKT and ERK1/2 activation status and showed an
additive effect with drugs used in standard chemotherapy
(5-fluorouracil, SN-38 and oxaliplatin) in colorectal cancer
patients.

CIP2A in Lung Cancers
CIP2A is overexpressed in non-small cell lung
cancer [42]. Although the mechanism of the involvement

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

4584

of CIP2A in lung cancer is not clearly understood,
some recent studies have indicated the involvement of
interleukin-10 (IL-10) in this event. The role of CIP2A
in mediating interleukin-10 effect in the progression of
human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated lung cancer has
been recently studied [43]. The secretion of IL-10 in both
malignant and immune cells is known to promote the
progression of lung tumors hence it negatively impacts
patient prognosis. The secretion of IL-10 by immune
and malignant cells, as induced by the E6 protein of
human papilloma virus type 16 or 18, contributed to
tumor progression by upregulating CIP2A and MYC.
HPV-infected lung cancer cells upregulated IL-10 at
the transcriptional level (involving phosphorylation of
cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 and CCAAT/
enhancer binding protein β) which stimulates an autocrine
loop relying on the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) by binding to
IL-10R expressed by immune cells and IL-10 in turn may
imbalance TH1 vs. TH2 tumor-specific immune responses
cumulatively favoring tumor progression. Above studies
collectively indicate the involvement of CIP2A during
malignant progression of lung tumors and argue in
favor of the fact that IL-10 may aid in promoting tumor
aggressiveness via upregulation of CIP2A transcription in
lung adenocarcinoma [44] .

found to be co-overexpressed [47].
MYC-dependent regulation and prognostic role of
CIP2A in gastric cancer has been reported by Khanna et
al. [48]. In other study Li et al., reported that CIP2A is
overexpressed in gastric cancer wherein CIP2A can serve
as a biomarker and its depletion leads to an impaired
clonogenicity of tumor cells [49]. CIP2A in tumor
cells from malignant gastric tissues helped to maintain
proliferation by preventing cell growth arrest, senescence,
or differentiation and CIP2A expression is significantly (P
< 0.001) discriminatory between normal and cancerous
gastric tissue [49]. The relationship between specific
bacterial infection and CIP2A-associated oncogenic
changes has been demonstrated by Zhao et al., who
proposed a model to explain the effect of CagA positive
H. pylori infection on CIP2A in gastric epithelial cells.
Their study demonstrated that the bacterial oncoprotein
CagA protein [Certain H. pylori strains have a 35–40 kb
cag pathogenicity island (PAI), which is encoded by 27–
33 genes; One of the constituents of the cag PAI is cagA
that encodes a 120–140 kDa CagA protein] was tyrosinephosphorylated by non receptor tyrosine kinase, SRC
kinase, and thereafter activated the MEK/ERK pathway
to upregulate CIP2A expression in AGS cells. They also
found that H. pylori infection-induced MYC stabilization
was partially dependent on CIP2A expression, while
CIP2A depletion caused increased MYC degradation [50].

CIP2A in Osteosarcoma

CIP2A in Pancreatic Cancers

CIP2A has been identified as a critical oncoprotein
involved in cell proliferation and invasion, which could
serve as a therapeutic target in osteosarcoma. Knockdown
of CIP2A expression significantly reduced osteosarcoma
cell proliferation and invasion, with decreased c-MYC
expression and p-AKT expression. CIP2A depletion
also facilitated apoptosis and inhibited MMP9 mRNA
expression [45]. Considering the role of MMP9 and other
members of MMP family in mediating invasion of tumor
cells, inhibition of mRNA expression for MMP9 following
depletion of CIP2A clearly indicated a direct effect of
CIP2A in metastasis in this cancer.

Immuno-histochemical staining demonstrated
that CIP2A expression correlated with poor tumor
differentiation, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis in
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis of data from patients with CIP2A-positive
expression showed lower overall survival rate than those
with CIP2A-negative expression. Furthermore positive
expression of CIP2A was strongly associated with loss
of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and acquisition of the
expression of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and
vimentin suggesting that CIP2A might promote epithelialmesenchymal transformation (EMT) and progression
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which together
indicates that CIP2A may be a potential therapeutic target
for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [51].
Recently Farrell et al., have reported that endogenous
inhibitors of PP2A, SET (also known as I2PP2A) and
CIP2A were overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer
and contributed to decreased PP2A activity as well as
overexpression and stabilization of the oncoprotein
c-MYC [52]. Their results indicated that antagonizing
SET and/or CIP2A may be an innovative approach for the
treatment of human pancreatic cancer.

CIP2A in Esophageal and Gastric Cancers
CIP2A is overexpressed in esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma [46] and increased CIP2A expression is a
predictor of poor survival in esophageal cancer. Rantanen
et al., demonstrated that there is a positive correlation
between CIP2A and c-MYC expression (p = 0.018) in
esophageal adenocarcinoma. Although according to
adjusted Cox regression survival analysis CIP2A and
c-MYC had no effect on survival, among patients with
stage IVA-IVB cancer, there was a trend toward poor
prognosis in CIP2A-positive patients. The expression of
CIP2A and c-MYC were associated with one another, and
in most cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma they were

effective in both p53- and RB-deficient cancer cells [58].
Results from studies in different organ-type
cancers including breast cancer indicated that CIP2A,
rather than independently/ exclusively accomplishing
the tumorigenic effect in cells, forms an important
component of the “oncogenic nexus” in concert with
PP2A and c-MYC. Recently a report by Baldacchino et
al., demonstrated that deregulation of PP2A is a common
event in breast cancer and a particular subset of patients
with suppressed PP2A activity are potentially eligible
for treatment using therapies which target the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway such as phosphatase activators
like FTY720 [59]. They reported that the cBioPortal for
Cancer Genomics shows that 46.7% (245 cases out of 525
eligible cases) of all the subtypes of breast cancer patients
either had a low expression, including deletions, of one
of the PP2A complex components or a high expression,
including amplification, of the inhibitory regulatory
subunits (the criteria were generally mutually exclusive,
except for PPP2CB and the PPP2R2A which can occur
simultaneously). Furthermore 8.6% of the patients either
had a high expression of CIP2A (KIAA1524) or a high
expression of SET, an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A,
which implied that the PP2A complex is sequestered in
the cells. This in turn strengthens our argument that in
a cell undergoing an oncogenic transformation, CIP2A
activation may accompany a functional downregulation
of PP2A either by mutation of its functional subunits or
by high expression of its endogenous inhibitor, SET.

The reports on the role of CIP2A in brain cancer are
limited. Yi et al., reported the expression and biological
role of CIP2A in human astrocytoma [53]. In their study
to investigate the clinical significance and biological
function of CIP2A in astrocytoma Yi et al., observed an
overexpression of CIP2A which was positively correlated
with advanced tumor grades. CIP2A depletion in the
astrocytoma cell lines inhibited cell growth, reduced
anchorage‑independent cell growth and increased
apoptosis. In addition CIP2A depletion increased
caspase‑3 cleavage and downregulated c‑MYC, BCL2
and pAKT expression. Although this study indicates role
of CIP2A as a clinically relevant oncoprotein and point
out that CIP2A may be a promising therapeutic target of
astrocytoma, further studies in this direction are required
to draw a conclusion.

CIP2A in Breast Cancers
CIP2A is associated with human breast cancer
aggressiveness [54] and the overexpression of CIP2A
has been shown to increase the proliferation of RAS/
RAF mutated aggressive MDA-MB231 cell line [55].
Interestingly MDA-MB231, a RAS/RAF mutated cell
line also is a MYC-dependent cell [56]. Yu et al., studied
the expression and regulatory effects of CIP2A protein
in breast cancer to report a correlation between CIP2A
protein expression and the prognosis of breast cancer
[57]. CIP2A signature revealed the MYC dependency
of CIP2A-regulated phenotypes in the breast cancer.
Niemelä et al., by studying the clinical relevance of the
CIP2A-regulated transcriptome in breast cancer subtypes
reported a high-confidence transcriptional signature that
is regulated by CIP2A [16]. Bioinformatics pathway
analyses of the CIP2A signature revealed that CIP2A
regulates several MYC-dependent as well as MYCindependent gene programs [16] . CIP2A expression was
also associated with MYC gene amplification (P<0.001).
With regard to MYC, these results both validate CIP2A’s
role in regulating MYC-mediated gene expression and
provide a plausible novel explanation for the high MYC
activity in basal-like and HER2+ breast cancers. Laine et
al., identified that the E2F1-CIP2A positive feedback loop
is a key determinant of breast cancer cell sensitivity to
senescence and growth arrest induction [21] the results
of which may also facilitate stratification strategies for
selection of patients to receive senescence-inducing
cancer therapies. In a recent report, an important role for
the E2F1-CIP2A feedback loop in causing senescence
resistance in p53 compromised cancer cells has been
demonstrated. It has been further proposed by Laine and
Westermark that targeting of E2F1-CIP2A the feedback
loop could provide a pro-senescence therapy that is

CIP2A in Bladder Cancers
Huang et al., reported that CIP2A protein is
specifically expressed in human bladder tumors. CIP2A
is preferentially expressed in high-grade and high-stage
TCC tumors, which are high-risk and invasive tumors.
Their studies supported the role of CIP2A in bladder
cancer progression and indicated the usefulness of CIP2A
for the surveillance of recurrence or progression of human
bladder cancer [60]. In another study, CIP2A was also
reported as a predictor of survival and a novel therapeutic
target in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma [61].

CIP2A in Ovarian Cancers
CIP2A is overexpressed in human ovarian cancer
and its expression has been found to regulate cell
proliferation and apoptosis. Fang et al., reported that
65.79 % of all the tumors in their study showed CIP2A
overexpression including serous carcinomas (68.48
%), endometrioid carcinomas (63.64 %), mucinous
carcinomas (52.17 %) and clear cell carcinomas (100
%). CIP2A overexpression positively correlated with
advanced FIGO stage and tumor grade. CIP2A depletion
in ovarian cancer cell lines inhibited proliferation, blocked

apoptosis, downregulated cyclin D1, c-MYC, p-RB,
BCL2 and pAKT expression validating the role of CIP2A
as a clinically relevant oncoprotein as well as establishing
CIP2A as a promising therapeutic target of ovarian cancer

expression is a novel marker of reduced survival in serous
ovarian cancer patients [63].

hematopoietic cells, while all patients with refractory
cytopenia with unilineage or multilineage dysplasia and
the control group were negative. CIP2A was mainly
expressed by the MPO-positive myeloid series of cells and
partly by the CD34-positive cells in association with the
expression of phosphorylated c-MYC (p-c-MYC) protein
and the cell cycle-related proteins Ki-67 and geminin. The
percentage of phospho-c-MYC-positive cells in the bone
marrow of CIP2A-positive MDS cases was significantly
higher than that in CIP2A-negative MDS cases (P < 0.01).
The expression levels of mRNA for CIP2A and PP2A
exhibited positive correlation in MDS/control bone
marrow. The data indicated that up-regulated expression
of CIP2A might play a role in the proliferation of blasts
in the MDS bone marrow and in disease progression in at
least some cases. Increased expression of CIP2A has been
also reported in aggressive subtypes of B-cell lymphoma
by Lilja et al. [79]. CIP2A levels at diagnosis of chronic
myeloid leukemia are known as a critical determinant of
the disease progression [80]. CIP2A is also overexpressed
in acute myeloid leukaemia and associated with HL60
cells proliferation and differentiation [77]. CIP2A was not
only associated with the proliferation of the tumor cells
or the progression of the disease, it was also found to be
associated with the chromosomal translocation in these
cancers. Coenen et al., identified CIP2A (KIAA1524)
as a novel MLL translocation partner in acute myeloid
leukemia [81]. Odero MD and colleagues had showed
that PP2A inactivation is a recurrent event in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and that overexpression of SET
(I2PP2A) is a poor prognostic factor in this disease [8284]. The fact that restoration of tumor suppressor activity
by PP2A-activating drugs has anti-leukemic effects in both
KIT-positive and KIT-negative AML cells suggests that
salvaging PP2A function could represent an innovative
therapeutic target in AML.

CIP2A in Other solid Cancers
CIP2A
is
overexpressed
in
human
cholangiocarcinoma tissues, which correlated with poor
prognosis and the expression of CIP2A protein was an
independent prognostic factor for cholangiocarcinoma
patients [64]. Expression of CIP2A in renal cell
carcinomas correlated with tumor invasion, metastasis
and patients’ survival [65]. High CIP2A immunoreactivity was an independent prognostic indicator in
early-stage tongue cancer [66]. CIP2A was overexpressed
in cervical cancer [67] and its expression was upregulated
by human papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein [68]. CIP2A
expression was also increased in prostate cancer [69].
CIP2A expression and localization in oral carcinoma and
dysplasia has been reported in different studies [70, 71].
Repression of CIP2A coding sequence was reported as the
mechanism by which tumor suppressor miR-375 regulated
MYC expression [72] in oral cancers. Furthermore CIP2A
gene polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma
susceptibility has been reported [73]. CIP2A is highly
expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and its expression
predicts poor prognosis [74, 75]. Recent studies by Wei
et al., have demonstrated that miR-218 regulated the
biological process of melanoma development by targeting
the 3’-UTR of the oncogenes CIP2A and BMI1 and thus
observed that CIP2A and BMI1 knockdown phenocopies
miR-218 overexpression [76]. Their studies show that
miR-218 plays a pivotal role in the development of the
disease and by targeting CIP2A and BMI1, miR-218
regulates the proliferation, migration and invasion of the
melanoma cell lines A375 and SK-MEL-2, explaining
miR-218’s pivotal role in melanoma development.

A cross-cancer alteration summary for CIP2A
(Gene Name: KIAA1524)
Although CIP2A has been shown to be
overexpressed in a number of solid as well as myeloid
cancers, it is evident that there are only a handful of
reports regarding the involvement of CIP2A in each of
the organ type cancers. We have performed a cross-cancer
alteration summary for KIAA1524 (69 studies / 1 gene)
using c-Bioportal (Figure 2). Data mining was carried
out using cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, a data portal
(cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics [85]), available at http://
www.cbioportal.org to measure the incidence of conditions
that are associated with the alterations in KIAA1524 gene,
as per the criteria mentioned in the legends of respective
figures (Fig. 2-4). The database query was based on
deregulation (mutant, copy number alterations and altered
expression) of the KIAA1524 gene. Tumor types (tumor

CIP2A is over-expressed in acute myeloid
leukaemia and associated with HL60 cells proliferation
and differentiation [77]. Overexpression of CIP2A in
bone marrow cells from a group of patients with a highrisk of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has been
reported by Li et al., who demonstrated that CIP2A plays
an important role in the progression of myelodysplastic
syndromes [78]. IHC analysis revealed that a patient
having refractory anemia with excess blasts exhibited
significant expression of CIP2A in bone marrow

Data show that out of different organ type cancers

harboring genetic changes in CIP2A the most predominant
alterations (mutations and putative copy-number
alterations from GISTIC) occurred in lung squamous cell
carcinoma in which the Gene Set / Pathway was altered
in more than 50% of all cases (Lung Squamous Cell
Carcinoma, TCGA, Nature 2012/Tumors with sequencing

this the mutation occurred in less than 4% cases while
the amplification occurred in more than 6% cases, while
more than 40 % cases showed “Gain”. In an individual
cancer type the ratio of mutation to amplification varied
from 1 (as in cervical cancer; data not shown) to mutation
> amplification as in melanoma, bladder, uterine (data not
shown) to amplification > mutation as in ovarian cancer
and head & neck cancers. Certain cancers harbored only
mutations as in bladder cancers, stomach cancers, lung

all 459 Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma cases
(TCGA, Provisional; TCGA Head and Neck squamous cell
carcinoma, containing 459 samples; raw data at the NCI).
We have selected three organ type cancers with higher
percentage of changes in CIP2A including lung squamous
cell carcinoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma and
Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma in the context
of clinical attributions and tabulated the changes in
CIP2A (KIAA1524) gene. The custom case sets for
individual cancer were build for (A) Disease Free Status
(this group represented the data either from the patients
whose disease recurred / progressed or the patients who
were disease free) and (B) Overall Survival Status (this
group represented the data either from the deceased
patients or from the patients who were alive) (Figure
3). The table shows that in Head and Neck carcinomas,
the alterations in KIAA1524 were higher in the patients
whose disease recurred/progressed as compared to disease
free patients. However this pattern was found opposite in
ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma and lung carcinomas.
When each of the recurred/progressed and disease free
groups were broken down into deceased and living in
Head and Neck cancer, the percentage of the change in
the gene was found higher in the deceased group that the

living group, a pattern opposite to that has been found in
the lung squamous cell carcinoma patients. It will need
a greater and in-depth study involving a higher number
of cases to establish any association between the change
in the KIAA1524 gene and the clinical attributes towards
determing the prognostic value of KIAA1524. Considering
the contribution of CIP2A in the process of tumorigenesis
in different cancers, we have also determined the
alterations (Amplification and Gain) of KIAA1524
gene in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA,
Provisional), Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma
(TCGA, Provisional), and Head & Neck Squamous Cell
Carcinoma (TCGA, Provisional) using c-bioPortal (Figure
4). Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma exhibited more
than 50% of cases (out of 575) where an alteration (either
gain or amplification) was recorded. We have not observed
a clear seperation of the line representing patients showing
no alteration from the line representing patients showing
the alteration in the Overall Survival curve (OS; KaplanMeier estimate).
Additionally dominant types of alterations in
KIAA1524 gene which were observed across different
organ-type cancers were in the category/level of “gain”
under data type of copy number alterations (CNA). Most

of these “gain(s)” were observed in cervical squamous
cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (TCGA,
Provisional), where the gain was observed in 55.6% (20
cases out of 36 total cases) cases (c-BioPortal data; not
presented due to limitation of permission). The other
cancers which exhibited a similar order of frequency of
the alteration (gain) in KIAA1524 were lung squamous
cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,
ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, and bladder urothelial
carcinoma. It appears from the results from different
laboratories who studied the tumorigenic involvement
of CIP2A, PP2A and c-MYC in different organ-type
cancers, that CIP2A forms an important component of
the “oncogenic nexus” in concert with PP2A and c-MYC
in achieving the tumorigenic effect in cells. Recently
Baldacchino et al., reported that the cBioPortal for Cancer
Genomics shows that PP2A is deregulated in 59.6% of
basal type of breast tumors [59]. We have also observed
that many of these cancer types like ovarian serous
cystadenocarcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma and
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with higher
frequencies of gain in KIAA1524 gene also have high
frequencies of alterations in c-MYC oncogene (both gain
and amplification) (data not shown). Considering the role
of CIP2A protein in the stabilization of c-MYC protein, it
will be worthwhile to look for an additional relationship
between these two oncoproteins in coordinating an
oncogenic transformation in cells. However it is beyond
the scope of our current review to critically evaluate the
nature of relationship between these two genes and their
respective proteins.
It appears from the data that there is an upregulation
of the genetic message for KIAA1524 across different
organ type cancers specially those exhibiting a “gain”
around 50%. Considering the role of protein product of
KIAA1524 gene in cells, it is possible that this event
is link to oncogenic transformations. Two facts are in
favor of this argument. First the product of KIAA1524
gene CIP2A is a proto-oncoprotein and second, CIP2A
is overexpressed at high frequency (40-80%) in most
of the human cancer types (as discussed in this review).
But the strongest support for this conclusion comes from
the systematic analysis by Khanna et al., towards the
contribution of potential gene regulatory mechanisms
for high CIP2A expression in cancer [87]. Searching
for the mechanisms of induction of CIP2A expression
in cancer, they identified proximal -27 to -107 promoter
region responsible for MEK-dependent stimulation of
CIP2A expression (two functional ETS1 sites on the
proximal CIP2A promoter) and reported that ETS1 acts
as the transcription factor mediating stimulation of CIP2A
expression through the EGFR-MEK pathway. CIP2A
mRNA expression was sensitive to inhibition of EGFR
activity as well as inhibition or activation of the MEKERK pathway. Khanna et al., in their bioinformatics
analysis of overexpression of CIP2A and components of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the EGFR-MEK1/2-ETS1 pathway from two different
genome wide leukemia studies have identified M6
subtype of acute myeloid leukemia as a cancer type in
which CIP2A and representative genes of each level of
the pathway (EGFR, MEK2 and ETS1) were significantly
upregulated. The result of the study demonstrate that
the EGFR-MEK1/2-ETS1 pathway is a critical positive
regulator of CIP2A expression revealing a potential link
between deregulated EGFR-MEK1/2-ETS1 pathway
signaling and CIP2A-dependent tumor growth [87]. In
contrast to the role of ETS1 alone in the transcriptional
control of CIP2A as reported by Khanna et al., in prostate
and gastric carcinomas, the later reports by Pallai et
al., showed that additional factors also regulate CIP2A
expression in a cell-type specific manner [88]. Pallai et
al., have characterized the proximal promoter region
of the human CIP2A gene in cervical, endometrial and
liver carcinoma cells to demonstrate that the 5’ flanking
minimal proximal promoter of the CIP2A gene consists
of putative binding sites for ETS1 and ELK1 in forward
and reverse orientations. Pallai et al.,demonstrated that in
cervical, endometrial and liver carcinoma cell lines, the
binding of both ETS1 and ELK1 to the proximal CIP2A
promoter is absolutely required for CIP2A expression.
ETS1 and ELK1 binding was found essential for the basal
expression of CIP2A in several urogenital cancer cell lines.
This observation is complementary to our observation
that bladder urothelial carcinoma exhibited a high order
of frequency in the alteration (gain) in KIAA1524 (Fig.
2). However the patho-physiological relationship between
the “gain” in KIAA1524 gene and the transcriptional
expression of CIP2A protein remains unresolved.

CIP2A as Biomarkers in Cancers: Prognostic
Value
The “oncogenic nexus” of CIP2A has provided
some advantages in the choice/use of certain drugs. It
has been reported that CHK1 targeting reactivated PP2A
tumor suppressor activity in cancer cells via CIP2A
[23]. Studies from Khanna et al., suggest that because
the CHK1-CIP2A-PP2A pathway is driven by DNA-PK
activity, functioning regardless of p53 or ATM/ATR status,
which may (1) explain how CHK1 inhibitors mediate
single-agent anticancer efficacy and (2) define CIP2APP2A status in cancer cells as a pharmacodynamic marker
for the response to CHK1-targeted therapy [23].
CIP2A expression may be a potential biomarker
for chemotherapeutic sensitivity and prognosis in breast
cancer [57]. Interestingly Liu et al., demonstrated that
auto-antibodies against p90/CIP2A may be useful serum
biomarker for early stage breast cancer screening and
immuno-diagnosis [89].
CIP2A is highly expressed in hepatocellular
carcinoma and its expression predicted poor prognosis
4591

Oncotarget

in this cancer [74, 75]. CIP2A gene polymorphisms and
hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility has been reported
[73]. Bortezomib (a proteosome inhibitor used in clinics
on myeloma patients) congeners induced apoptosis in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells via CIP2A inhibition [90].
The inhibition of CIP2A has been shown to determine the
effect of bortezomib on apoptosis and PP2A-dependent
AKT inactivation in hepatocellular carcinoma indicating
that CIP2A may be a biomarker for predicting clinical
response of bortezomib in hepatocellular carcinoma
treatment [91].
CIP2A regulates bortezomib-induced apoptosis
in leukemia cells [92]. Cancerous inhibitor of protein
phosphatase 2A was expressed in leukemic blasts from
bone marrow samples. Ectopic expression of CIP2A
upregulated pAKT and protected HL-60 cells from
bortezomib-induced apoptosis, whereas silencing CIP2A
overcame the resistance to bortezomib-induced apoptosis
in MOLT3 and K562 cells. Bortezomib also exerted in
vivo antitumor activity in HL-60 xenografted tumors
and induced cell death in some primary leukemic cells
indicating a major role in mediating bortezomib-induced
apoptosis in leukemia cells.
A prognostic role for CIP2A expression has been
reported in serous ovarian cancer [63]. CIP2A protein
expression is a novel marker of reduced survival in serous
ovarian cancer patients [63]. Their study concluded that
CIP2A could be used to predict biological behavior in the
group of patients with otherwise favorable prognosis. The
result suggested that CIP2A characterized (sub-classified)
the aggressive type of the disease even within subgroups
with initially favorable prognosis. The association of
CIP2A expression with survival evaluated by KaplanMeier method demonstrated that CIP2A immunopositivity is a marker of reduced overall survival. Positive
CIP2A expression was more frequently observed with high
grade, advanced stage, aberrant p53 immuno-reactivity,
high proliferation index, and aneuploidy of tumor cells
[63]. Even in subgroups of patients with favorable clinical
factors, CIP2A expression was strongly associated with
reduced survival.
Huang et al., identified and evaluated CIP2A
(both mRNA or protein) as a novel reliable and sensitive
biomarker for diagnostics (early detection) in cervical
cancer [93]).Their studies indicated that CIP2A (mRNA/
protein) was specifically expressed (1) in cervical cancer
tissues (different cancer stages), but not in non-cancer
or adjacent non-tumor cervical tissue and (2) in cervical
cell lines, but not in normal epithelial cell lines. The data
strongly indicated that only CIP2A (but not PP2A or
c-MYC) is a reliable biomarker for detection of cervical
cancer and furthermore there was no strong correlation
of CIP2A expression with HPV subtype, age, ethnical
background, or other patient characteristics.
Studies undertaken by Huang et al., to test the
expression of CIP2A for bladder cancer diagnostics
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrated CIP2A as a novel bladder cancer biomarker
[94]. In their study CIP2A protein was found specifically
expressed in bladder tumor tissue at different cancer stages
like most of other solid tumors, and not in adjacent nontumor bladder tissue. CIP2A protein was also abundantly
expressed in bladder cancer cell lines while it was not
expressed in non-neoplastic epithelial cell lines.
The p90/CIP2A has been referred to as a fetal oncoprotein in lung cancer [95]. Expression data for CIP2A
in lung cancer also supported the working hypothesis
that auto-antibody production in cancer may be directly
linked to aberrant expression of proteins involved
in tumorigenesis pathways. Peng et al., identified an
immune response to p90/CIP2A in lung cancer [95]. In
order to address the possibility whether or not the p90/
CIP2A might be a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and
a useful biomarker in lung cancer, they used the fulllength recombinant p90/CIP2A protein as the antigen in
an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and Western
blotting was performed for the detection of autoantibodies in 105 sera from patients. Of the 72 lung
cancer tissue specimens examined, increased expression
of p90/CIP2A was observed in 61 (84.7%) specimens,
which was significantly higher than in normal lung tissues
(14.3%, 9/63). Data indicated that tested together with
antibodies against other well-validated TAAs such as p53,
p62/IMP2, auto-antibody to p90/CIP2A might provide
a potential novel marker for lung cancer detection. In
other studies, overexpressed CIP2A correlated with poor
prognosis in non-small cell lung cancers [42]. CIP2A
expression in non-small cell lung cancers correlated with
TNM stage, while survivin expression correlated with
TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis showed that the overall survival times
in patients expressing either CIP2A or survivin protein in
non-small cell lung cancers were shorter. The expression
of CIP2A protein was an independent prognostic factor
for non-small cell lung cancers patients (COX regression
analysis). Therefore CIP2A expression in non-small cell
lung cancers patients may be an useful biomarker of
malignancy [96].
The prognostic significance of CIP2A has been
reported in several other malignancies including cancers
of skin, stomach, colon/rectum and pancreas. CIP2A has
proved its prognostic significance in cutaneous malignant
melanoma (CMM). In their study Shi et al., demonstrated
that CIP2A immuno-staining level was correlated with
Breslow thickness, Clark’s Level and lymphovascular
invasion and high-CIP2A expression was associated with
poor survival for patients, while in vitro downregulation
of CIP2A attenuated metastasis of CMM cells [97].
CIP2A is a predictor of poor prognosis in colon cancer
[98]. Peng et al., investigated the clinical significance
of the expression of CIP2A in human colorectal cancer
and examined the association of CIP2A expression with
clinico-pathology and prognosis to show that up-regulated
4592

Oncotarget

CIP2A expression is closely related to clinico-pathology
of colorectal cancer. Their study indicated that CIP2A
may be used as a potential predictive marker of metastasis,
prognosis and therapeutic target in colorectal cancer
[99]. MYC-dependent regulation and prognostic role of
CIP2A is reported in gastric cancer [48]. Multivariate
analysis as reported by Wang et al., showed that CIP2A
expression is associated with altered expression of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and
is an independent prognostic factor for pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma patients [51].

a higher efficacy than erlotinib on growth inhibition and
apoptosis in erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer
H460 and H322 cell lines through the CIP2A-PP2AAKT pathway. Mechanistically their data also show
that overexpression of CIP2A upregulated pAKT and
protected H460 cells from TD-19-induced apoptosis [104].
CIP2A represents a major factor through which erlotinib
derivatives induce apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma
cells. The di-substituted erlotinib derivatives were tested
for their ability to inhibit CIP2A and mediate cancer-cell
proliferation. A correlation was observed between cell
death, CIP2A and AKT inhibition by these derivatives.
Inhibition of CIP2A determined erlotinib-induced
apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma [105]. Erlotinib
derivatives as CIP2A-ablating agents independent of
EGFR activity have also been developed [106].

CIP2A as Therapeutic Target
Based on the experimental evidence that CIP2A
has a clinical relevance in the progression of the disease
it has been regarded that CIP2A inhibitors have potential
for use in the treatment in cancers. So far CIP2A has been
targeted in a limited number of cancers using (1) natural
compounds, (2) fusogenic-oligoarginine peptide-mediated
delivery of siRNAs for gene silencing and (3) erlotinib
derivatives.
Recently CIP2A has been targeted by a natural
compound celastrol in non-small-cell lung cancer. Liu et
al., demonstrated that celastrol binds CIP2A and enhances
the CIP2A-CHIP interaction, leading to ubiquitination/
degradation of CIP2A. Inhibition of CIP2A by celastrol
inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo. Their study also showed that celastrol potentiates
cisplatin’s efficacy by suppressing the CIP2A-AKT
pathway indicating that CIP2A inhibitors may represent
novel therapeutics for this cancer [100].
CIP2A has been targeted using fusogenicoligoarginine peptide-mediated delivery of siRNAs in oral
cancer cells. Cantini et al., demonstrated that a chimeric
peptide consisting of a fusogenic sequence, in combination
with cell-penetrating residues, can be used to effectively
deliver siRNAs into oral cancer cells and induce the
silencing of its target gene, potentially offering a novel
therapeutic strategy involving CIP2A in combating oral
cancer [101].
Studies have been undertaken in search of a lead
compound for the development of CIP2A inhibitor
for cancer therapies. In one of these studies a natural
compound, ethoxysanguinarine (ESG), has been found
to be effectively downregulating CIP2A protein and its
downstream signaling molecules, c-MYC and pAKT,
and ESG has been found to induce protein phosphatase
2A (PP2A) activity [102]. In their study Liu et al., also
demonstrated that ESG inhibited proliferation and induced
apoptosis of lung cancer cells and enhanced the effects of
cisplatin on malignant cells.
Shiau et al., reported development of erlotinib
derivatives which closely resemble erlotinib structurally
but are devoid of tyrosine-kinase inhibitory activity as
CIP2A inhibitors [103]. TD-19 (erlotinib derivative) had

Role of CIP2A in Drug response and Developing
Chemo-Resistance in Cancers
The central role of CIP2A in the “oncogenic
nexus” allows CIP2A to mediate the effects (cancer cell
phenotypes) of many anti-cancer drugs. These effects not
only confirm the pivotal role of CIP2A in the “oncogenic
nexus”, but also helps to understand the mechanism
of action of CIP2A in (1) the cellular transformation
(oncogenic) and the progression of cancer cells (e.g.
EMT), (2) mediating different drug responses (as drug
target), (3) mediating drug-induced resistance and (4)
determining the prognosis of a disease.
In line with its role as an oncogenic protein in the
transformation of cells and the progression of a disease,
CIP2A has been shown to play a role in mediating a
number of drug effects in cancer. In hepatocellular
carcinoma cells, Chen et al., reported that CIP2A mediates
the effect of bortezomib on pAKT and apoptosis [91].
Following their observation that CIP2A is involved
in mediating the apoptotic effect of bortezomib in
hepatocellular carcinoma, Yu et al., also reported a
proteasome-independent mechanism by which bortezomib
induces autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma through
the CIP2A-PP2A-AKT-4EBP1 pathway [107]. The
in vivo study showed that bortezomib downregulated
CIP2A and upregulated PP2A activity in Huh-7 tumors.
Ectopic expression of CIP2A decreased AKT-related
PP2A activity whereas silencing CIP2A increased this
activity, indicating that CIP2A negatively regulates AKTrelated PP2A activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells
[91]. CIP2A-mediated AKT activation also plays a role in
bortezomib-induced apoptosis in head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma [108]. Bortezomib sensitizes hepatocellular
carcinoma cells to CS-1008, an anti-human death receptor
5 antibody, through the inhibition of CIP2A [109]. CIP2A
has been shown to be expressed in leukemic blasts from
bone marrow samples. Liu et al., reported that bortezomib

exerted in vivo antitumor activity in HL-60 xenografted
tumors and induced cell death in some primary leukemic
cells. Their study revealed that CIP2A plays a major role
in mediating bortezomib-induced apoptosis in leukemia
cells [92]. Inhibition of CIP2A is reported to be one of the
mechanism by which bortezomib-mediated enhancement
of radiation-induced apoptosis occurs in different solid
tumors [110]. Treatment with bortezomib plus radiation
downregulated CIP2A in a dose-dependent manner.
Knockdown of CIP2A enhanced radiation-induced
apoptosis in cancer cells, and ectopic expression of CIP2A
in cancer cells abolished radiation-induced apoptosis.
Thus bortezomib sensitized solid tumor cells to radiation
through the inhibition of CIP2A. It suggests bortezomib
may sensitize solid tumor cells to radiation through the
inhibition of CIP2A. Tseng et al., also demonstrated that
CIP2A mediates bortezomib-induced apoptosis also in
TNBC [111] which is in line with their previous reports
that CIP2A mediated effects of bortezomib on pAKT and
apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Tseng et al., has shown that CIP2A may be a novel
target in breast cancer cells [112]. CIP2A expression is
readily detectable in tumor samples from TNBC patients.
Liu et al., showed that bortezomib inhibited CIP2A in
association with pAKT downregulation in a dose- and
time-dependent manner in all sensitive TNBC cells and
in this way mediated the apoptotic effect of bortezomib.
CIP2A governs tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in ERnegative breast cancer cells [113]. When tested for the
efficacy of tamoxifen (in a panel of ER-negative breast
cancer cells), tamoxifen differentially effected apoptosis in
human ER-negative breast cancer cell lines as compared to
ER-positive lines. Tamoxifen inhibited CIP2A in a dosedependent manner in all apoptosis-sensitive ER-negative
breast cancer cells (MDA-MB468, MDA-MB453, MDAMB231), but not in resistant cells (HCC1937). Tamoxifen
treatment downregulated CIP2A in MDA-MB468
xenograft tumors, but not in HCC1937 tumors.
Wang et al., investigated the role of CIP2A in
mediating the synergism between temsirolimus (mTOR
inhibitor) and cetuximab (EGFR inhibitor) in colon cancer
and showed that temsirolimus mediated enhancement
of the efficacy of cetuximab in colon cancer is CIP2Adependent [114]. The mTOR protein immunoprecipitated
along with CIP2A protein. Temsirolimus decreased
pERK and phosphorylated v-AKT murine thymoma viral
oncogene (pAKT) and decreased the interaction of CIP2A
and mTOR in cell lines without the K-RAS codon 12
mutation. Temsirolimus decreased the resistance of cells to
cetuximab by both inhibiting transcription of CIP2A and
increasing degradation of CIP2A through the lysosomalautophagy pathway. CIP2A was found to be a prognostic
marker in colon cancer patients with weak expression
of pERK or pAKT and potential biomarkers for CIP2A
inhibitors include pERK and pAKT.
An increase in CIP2A expression was associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells [55].
Since CIP2A increases the proliferation of several
cancer cells, they measured the effect of CIP2A on the
doxorubicin-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation.
The authors’ work revealed the mechanism of CIP2A
regulation by doxorubicin and CIP2A-mediated
doxorubicin resistance. MDA-MB231 cells showed
an increase in CIP2A expression after treatment with
doxorubicin, while MCF7 cells showed a decrease in
CIP2A expression. The overexpression of CIP2A in
MCF7 cells overcame the inhibition of cell proliferation in
response to doxorubicin treatment. CIP2A expression was
not affected by wild-type or mutant p53 (lack of p53 leads
to doxorubicin resistance). As a regulatory mechanism of
doxorubicin-mediated CIP2A expression, it was showed
that phosphorylated AKT was involved in the suppression
of CIP2A expression. Mutant p53 blocked doxorubicinmediated CIP2A downregulation in HCT116 cells [55].

Future Perspectives
As studies are revealing the exquisitely complex
relationship between different oncogenic pathways and
cellular functions specific to different cancer types [115119], understanding how genetic changes upregulate the
growth promoting signaling pathways in cancer cells
will be the most rationale way in which researchers
can develop more effective therapeutic interventions in
future. Being a pleiotropic disease, cancer cells have a
characteristic way of changing over time and even within
a specific tumor. Cells may have different mutations
and dependencies on different signaling pathways for
survival or for metastatic potential [120]. New tools and
technologies for genomic- or systems-level analysis, in
addition to the conventional biochemistry and cell biology
approaches are starting to reveal how signaling pathways
of CIP2A’s “oncogenic nexus” contribute to cancer
development, cancer evolution, and drug resistance.
Surprisingly since CIP2A depletion did not induce
any overt short-term effects on cellular morphology or
viability, it is unlikely to show up in a genomic siRNA
screen designed to detect dramatic phenotypic readouts
due to depletion of a single protein [27]. Also CIP2A is
not sufficient alone to induce tumorigenic conversion of
immortalized mouse fibroblasts [2]. This characteristic of
CIP2A strongly indicates that CIP2A action is mediated
via its “oncogenic nexus” with other critical onco-proteins,
such as RAS and MYC as well as tumor suppressor,
PP2A. CIP2A antagonizes PP2A action and cooperates
with RAS and MYC in regulating malignant growth and
transformation.
One interesting aspect of CIP2A’s “oncogenic
nexus” appears to be its physiological role versus its
contribution to oncogenic transformation. It is clear
from the literature that CIP2A is hardly expressed in
non-transformed adult tissues (except testis). Peng et
4594

Conflict of interest:

al., reported that examination of the dynamic expression
of p90/CIP2A during mouse development shows that
p90/CIP2A protein is mainly expressed during embryo
development, and becomes silent after birth [95]. The
lack of physiological function of CIP2A in an adult
organism raises the question regarding its role outside
being an inhibitor of the tumor suppressor PP2A. Results
from a more recent study by Ventela et al., revealed first
physiological function for oncoprotein CIP2A [121].
They generated a CIP2A hypomorphic CIP2AHOZ mouse
using gene-trap technology. CIP2AHOZ mice were viable
and presented a normal lifespan and did not show any
obvious anatomical malformations. CIP2A expression
correlated with expression of spermatogonial progenitor
cell self-renewal marker PLZF and testicular germ cell
proliferation in mice. In human testicular spermatogonia,
CIP2A and PLZF expression were shown also to correlate
with Ki-67 expression. This study also demonstrated the
clinical relevance regarding targeting of oncogenic CIP2A
for future cancer therapies based on the fact that CIP2A
expression can be systematically inhibited without severe
consequences to normal mouse development and viability.
The fact that (1) there is a limited role of CIP2A in adult
cells and (2) CIP2A is overexpressed differentially in the
tumor compartment in contrast to the adjacent non-tumor
regions provides an unique opportunity to target CIP2A
for therapy. Targeting CIP2A will be more specific to the
tumor cells and also will have limited overall toxicity.
As a cancer target CIP2A is unique. The detailed
molecular structure of CIP2A remains to be resolved.
Although this poses a problem for CIP2A to be recognized
as a “druggable” candidate, the uniqueness of CIP2A
lies in its functions. CIP2A as an integral protein does
not have any enzymatic activity. Yet it has a strong and
bi-directional functional control over the enzymatic
action of PP2A and oncogenic transcription factor
MYC in transformed cells. CIP2A is a rare inhibitor of
tumor suppressor PP2A, protein phosphatase which
dephosphorylates several well-known oncogenes
including MYC, beta-catenin, AKT and BCL2 [3, 4].
Our current knowledge regarding the structure, function
and regulation of CIP2A with particular emphasis on its
“oncogenic nexus” opens up a possibility that CIP2A can
be targeted in cancers.
