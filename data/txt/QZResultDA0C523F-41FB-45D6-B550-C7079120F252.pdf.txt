Abstract

Author Manuscript

CBP and p300 are highly homologous transcriptional coactivators with unique, non-redundant
roles that bind a wide array of proteins, including catenins – β and γ. ICG-001 is a small molecule
inhibitor that specifically inhibits the CBP/catenin interaction. Importantly, ICG-001 does not
inhibit the p300/catenin interaction. We demonstrate that specifically inhibiting the interaction
between CBP and catenin with ICG-001, results in the differentiation of quiescent drug resistant
chronic myelogenous leukemia initiating cells (CML-LICs), thereby sensitizing them to BCRABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, e.g. Imatinib. Using ICG-001 in a NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ−/− mouse
model of engrafted human chronic myelogenous leukemia, we now demonstrate the complete
elimination of engrafted leukemia after only one course of combined chemotherapy. Combinationtreated animals live as long as their non-engrafted littermates. Results from these studies
demonstrate that specifically antagonizing the CBP/catenin interaction with ICG-001 can
eliminate drug resistant CML-LICs without deleterious effects to the normal endogenous
hematopoietic stem cell population.

Despite the stunning clinical success achieved to date in treating chronic phase chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML), responses in advanced phase patients treated with the BCRABL antagonist Gleevec/Imatinib (IM) are often short-lived, and patients generally undergo
disease progression.1 Even patients demonstrating complete response to IM therapy are not
cured, as discontinuation of IM treatment frequently results in relapse. Furthermore,
resistance to IM develops in 2% to 4% of patients annually and IM dose escalation is
generally not sufficient to control the disease.2 Several mechanisms that contribute to
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance have been proposed, including the insensitivity of
quiescent CML stem cells to TKIs due to low expression of BCR-ABL.3 Increased nuclear
β-catenin has been observed with progression to blast crisis, 4 a hallmark of increased Wnt/
β-catenin transcription.5 LICs are insensitive to TKIs and additionally, genomic instability in
this subpopulation is a significant concern.6 Although deletion of β-catenin after CML
initiation does not significantly affect survival in mice, deletion of β-catenin has been shown
to synergize with IM and abrogate CML stem cells.7
Aberrant Wnt signaling is associated with many cancers including CML.8 Many Wnt
signaling related genes are upregulated in CML, especially in association with disease
progression.9 Genes that are critically involved in oncogenesis, including survivin, have
been identified to be regulated by the activation of Wnt/catenin-mediated transcription.10,11
Epigenetic silencing of negative regulators of the Wnt signaling cascade is also frequently
associated with leukemias, including CML.12 β-catenin signaling is also activated during the
development of MLL leukemic stem cells.13

Wnt signaling is classically mediated through β-catenin,14 which in turn recruits the Kat3
co-activators, CREB Binding Protein (CBP) or its closely related homolog EP300 (p300), as
well as other components of the basal transcriptional apparatus.15,16 The distinct roles of the
co-activators CBP and p300 in self-renewal and differentiation respectively, has been
documented.17–20 This has also been confirmed at the genome wide level using ChIP-seq.21
Using a hematopoietic stem cell model, Livingston and co-workers concluded that CBP, but
not p300, is essential for HSC self-renewal, whereas p300 is critical for proper
hematopoietic differentiation.17,22 Additionally, Kawasaki et al. found that p300, but not
CBP, is absolutely required for retinoic acid-induced F9 teratocarcinoma cell
differentiation.23 Utilizing the specific small molecule CBP/catenin antagonist ICG-001, we
previously demonstrated that CBP and p300 have distinct functions in the regulation of βcatenin-mediated gene transcription including, c-myc, Cyclin D1,24 EphB2,25 and survivin/
BIRC5,10 the 4th most up-regulated transcript in cancer.26 The molecular mechanism of
ICG-001 has been previously described. Briefly, it modulates Wnt/catenin signaling by
specifically binding to CBP, but not p300, thereby disrupting the CBP/catenin interaction
and thus down-regulating CBP/catenin mediated transcription.24,27,28 The high affinity,
specific binding of ICG-001 to CBP subsequently leads to transiently increased p300/catenin
interaction, and thereby upregulation of p300/catenin mediated gene
transcription.10,24,25,27–31 The minimal ICG-001 binding region on CBP has been mapped to
amino acids 1–110 at the N-terminus; interestingly, the least homologous region between the
two coactivators.

The controversial dichotomous behavior of Wnt/catenin signaling in controlling both
maintenance of potency and differentiation in stem/progenitor cells can be readily explained
through our model of differential coactivator usage by catenin – i.e. CBP usage by catenin
leads to the transcriptional activation of cassettes of genes that are involved in the
maintenance of stem/progenitor cell potency and self-renewal; whereas, the use of the
coactivator p300, leads to activation of genes involved in the initiation of differentiation28,29
(Supplementary Figure S1). The use of p300 by catenin as a coactivator can be
pharmacologically induced by CBP/catenin antagonists e.g. ICG-001,24,25 thereby initiating
differentiation in a wide variety of systems25,28,30,31 and eliminating cancer stem-like cells
in both mouse genetic models19 and drug resistant human primary B-ALL.20

Author Manuscript

In this report, we demonstrate that IM-resistant CML cells exhibit characteristics consistent
with a quiescent LIC population. Our data also indicates that when the quiescent IMresistant population is treated with the CBP/catenin antagonist ICG-001, it initiates a
myeloid differentiation pathway. Treating this cell population with ICG-001 induces their
differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo, thereby sensitizing these quiescent drug resistant
cells to IM. Eliminating the LIC population via forced differentiation dramatically increases
the effectiveness of BCR-ABL antagonist chemotherapy both in vitro and in vivo in murine
models of CML. A CBP/catenin antagonist in combination with the BCR-ABL antagonist
Nilotinib completely eliminates engrafted chronic myelogenous leukemia in NSG mice,
without any apparent deleterious effects to the normal hematopoietic stem cell population as
judged by both hematopoietic parameters and overall lifespan compared to their nonirradiated, non-engrafted, untreated littermates.

Imatinib Resistant CML Cells Are Enriched in LIC

Author Manuscript

The oncoprotein BCR-ABL is the molecular target for TKIs, such as IM and second
generation agents Dasatinib and Nilotinib. However, the insensitivity of quiescent LICs to
TKIs constitutes a significant problem. Rather than trying to prospectively identify LICs via
specific cell surface markers,4,32,33 we chose to initiate our investigations using primary
CML patients’ samples, which we treated in vitro with IM to identify drug resistant
populations. IM resistance correlates with the emergence of drug resistant LICs, and is
associated with increased nuclear catenin levels and enhanced Wnt/catenin transcription.5
We anticipated that the drug resistant cell population would be enriched in LICs relative to
the drug sensitive population. Treatment in vitro with 1µM IM for 6–12 days was used to
select for resistant cells. IM treated versus control treated samples were analyzed by FACS.
DAPI was used to exclude dead cells. We consistently observed an IM resistant population
in all primary CML samples tested – both bone marrow and leukopheresis samples. This
was true regardless of whether the patient had previously received IM chemotherapy, or was
chemotherapy naive. The IM resistant cells were consistently characterized as being DAPI
negative, low forward and low side scatter (DAPIneg/Flow/Slow ) (Figure 1a, upper panel). In
contrast, the IM sensitive cells were DAPI negative, but exhibited both higher forward and
side scatter (DAPIneg/Fhi/Shi). Enrichment of the IM resistant cell population could be
achieved by treatment with IM in a dose dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S2A).

Cell cycle analysis revealed that approximately 65 times more IM sensitive cells compared
to the resistant cells are in S phase (13% versus 0.2%, respectively). Furthermore, 96% of
IM resistant cells were in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle versus 72% of the IM sensitive
cells (Figure 1a, lower panel). BrdU incorporation and Ki67 staining were consistent with
the cell cycle analysis (Figure 1b). These data are consistent with the IM resistant cells
having a highly quiescent, blast-like phenotype.

Author Manuscript

Recent studies have revealed that multi-drug resistance genes, including MDR-1, ABCG2,
and ABCA3 are intrinsically expressed in stem/progenitor cells from multiple adult tissues
and that they contribute to the Side Population (SP) phenotype of malignant cells.34,35 Wnt/
catenin signaling appears to play an important role in ABCB1/MDR-1 transcription and
multi-drug resistance36 and in particular, CBP/catenin signaling is critical to maintain the
SP.37 We therefore utilized Hoechst 33342 dye exclusion to identify the SP cells in the same
CML patient samples. Again, consistent with enrichment in LICs, the IM resistant cells
contributed to the majority of the SP cells in the CML samples – 77% vs. 23% for IM
resistant vs. IM sensitive (Supplementary Figure S2B).
We next examined the expression of BCR-ABL in both IM sensitive and resistant
populations using real-time qRT-PCR. BCR-ABL gene expression is significantly (3 times)
lower in the IM resistant cells compared with the IM sensitive cells (Figure 1c). This was
anticipated, as it has been previously demonstrated that IM does not eliminate the CML
leukemia initiating cell population. Both CML LICs and the IM resistant cell population do
not depend on the BCR-ABL oncoprotein for their survival.38

Author Manuscript

We next sorted IM resistant (1.6×105) and IM sensitive (2×105) cells and engrafted them
into NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ−/− (NSG) mice. After 6 months, the mice were sacrificed and
peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen were analyzed to determine the engraftment of
the human leukemic cells. In five out of five mice that received the IM resistant cells, we
could readily detect human CD45+ cell engraftment (Figure 1d). In sharp contrast, none of
the seven mice that received IM sensitive cells demonstrated any human CD45+ cell
engraftment at six months. BCR-ABL expression was confirmed by RT-PCR in all human
CD45+ samples collected. This confirmed that the IM resistant population was enriched in
LICs compared with the IM sensitive population.

CML LICs do not require BCR-ABL for their survival,38 however, as they differentiate and
become transient amplifying cells and expand, they increase their expression of this
oncoprotein. We therefore performed a series of experiments to determine whether the IM
resistant cell population, upon differentiation and expansion, also increased its expression of
BCR-ABL, like the leukemia initiating cell population. When IM resistant cells were
cultured for 4 days on the murine stromal cell line M2-10B4, BCR-ABL expression was
significantly increased by 10 fold (Figure 1e). In colony formation assays (CFC) using
freshly isolated IM resistant cells, we could not detect any CFC activity, unlike the IM
sensitive cells (Figure 1f). However, after co-culture on stroma for 5 weeks, IM resistant
cells acquired significant colony forming activity (Figure 1g). We conclude that
differentiating the primitive, quiescent IM resistant cell population on stroma generated

Inhibiting the CBP/catenin interaction initiates differentiation in CML LIC

ICG-001 by binding to the amino terminus of the coactivator CBP blocks the interaction
between CBP and catenin – both β and γ.24,39 This results in decreased transcription of
CBP/catenin dependent genes that are associated with tumor cell survival (e.g. survivin),26
with a concomitant increase in the expression of genes associated with cellular
differentiation (e.g. EphB2).25 We examined 3 CML patients’ samples, 2 BC and 1 IM
resistant, for β- and γ-catenin expression in subcellular fractions by immunoblotting
(Supplementary Figure S3). In two of 3 patients’ samples, there is significantly increased
nuclear γ-catenin. Next, we examined Wnt/catenin (β or γ-catenin) coactivator usage, either
CBP or p300 – by co-immunoprecipitation assay in both IM resistant and IM sensitive cell
populations. Treatment with IM has previously been shown to significantly increase γcatenin expression.10,39 After in vitro treatment of CML cells with IM, the majority of
nuclear catenin was γ-catenin in the IM resistant cells and was essentially exclusively
associated with CBP (Figure 2a, lane 7 vs. lane 8). Little or no catenin can be detected in
association with either coactivator in the IM sensitive cells (Figure 2a, lanes 5 and 6).

When LICs differentiate, there is a concomitant upregulation of BCR-ABL expression.40
ICG-001 is a potent initiator of differentiation in stem/progenitor cells,19,20,27,31,41 we
therefore evaluated BCR-ABL expression in the IM resistant LIC population. We treated
blast crisis CML patient samples with ICG-001, and examined the expression of BCR-ABL
and survivin/BIRC5. An inhibitor of apoptosis protein, survivin is the 4th most upregulated
transcript in cancer and is associated with chemotherapy resistance, increased tumor
recurrence, and poor prognosis.11,42 As shown in Figure 2b, ICG-001 treatment resulted in a
dramatic increase in BCR-ABL message in the IM resistant cells, with a 50% reduction in
survivin message in the IM resistant population as well as a smaller reduction in the IM
sensitive cells. Based on these results, we anticipated that ICG-001 would re-sensitize IM
resistant CML cells to IM.20

CML patient samples were first treated with ICG-001 prior to IM treatment. As expected,
ICG-001 treatment alone did not cause significant cell death (Supplementary Table 1).
However, there was a significant increase in apoptosis in the dual treated cells (ICG-001 pretreated, followed by IM), as compared to IM only treated cells (Figure 2c). Next, we tested
17 primary CML samples – 9 chronic phase patients, 4 blast crisis patients and 4 patients
that had failed IM therapy. These samples were pre-treated with either ICG-001 or DMSO
control for two days, and then exposed to low dose IM (0.2 µM) for two days. Again,
ICG-001 treatment alone did not result in significant cell death. However, in both IM naïve
samples, as well as samples from patients that had failed IM chemotherapy, cells pre-treated
with ICG-001 responded to IM more effectively, compared with cells pre-treated with the
DMSO-vehicle control as judged by increased apoptosis (Figure 2d). The down-regulation
of CBP/catenin signaling with ICG-001 treatment, as anticipated, resulted in decreased
survivin expression with a concomitant increase in BCR-ABL expression, thereby making

the cells BCR-ABL dependent, and thus more sensitive to IM. It is also important and worth
noting that the blast crisis/failed IM samples were also more responsive to IM after ICG-001
treatment.
Inhibiting the CBP/catenin interaction eliminates CML LICs
We next investigated the effects of ICG-001 on colony forming activity. When primary
unsorted patient samples were treated with 10µM ICG-001 for 2 days, the colony forming
cell (CFC) numbers were significantly decreased compared to the DMSO control samples
(Figure 2e, upper panel). When patient samples were combination-treated with IM and
ICG-001, this essentially eliminated colony forming activity (Figure 2e, lower panel).

Author Manuscript

To determine in vitro, which subset of the CML cell population was most sensitive to
ICG-001, we treated patient samples with IM alone, ICG-001 alone or in combination and
analyzed the viability of the IM-resistant (DAPIneg/Flow/Slow) and the IM-sensitive
(DAPIneg/Fhi/Shi) populations. Whereas IM’s effect, as anticipated, was manifested on the
IM-sensitive (DAPIneg/Fhi/Shi) cell population, the effect of ICG-001 was more pronounced
on the IM-resistant (DAPIneg/Flow/Slow) cells. There was a strong synergistic effect in both
cell populations treated with the combination of ICG-001 and IM (Figure 2f). Furthermore,
as anticipated ICG-001 also decreased the side population in these samples (Figure 2g).
Inhibiting CBP/Catenin interaction eliminates CML LIC engraftment in NSG mice

Author Manuscript

Having determined that ICG-001 can sensitize drug resistant CML LICs to IM in vitro, we
wanted to investigate the ability of ICG-001 to eliminate drug-resistant LIC in vivo. For
these studies, we first selected two well characterized CML cell lines that were derived from
blast crisis patients – K562 cells were sensitive to IM, whereas EM2 cells were resistant to
IM (Supplementary Figure S4A). We initially characterized the effects of ICG-001 on K562
and EM2 cells in vitro. Similar to our results with the CML patient samples, ICG-001
treatment decreased survivin and increased BCR-ABL expression in both K562 and EM2
cells at both the mRNA (Figure 3a) and protein level (Figure 3b).

Author Manuscript

Similar to the biochemical specificity data previously reported in other cell types,24 when
CML cells were treated with ICG-001, the CBP/catenin interaction was specifically
disrupted (Figure 3c, compare lanes 4 & 6), while the interaction between p300 and catenin
was enhanced (Figure 3c, compare lanes 5 & 7). Furthermore, as demonstrated by ChIP,
there was a decrease in CBP with concomitantly increased p300 occupancy at the human
survivin promoter in the presence of ICG-001 (Figure 3d). Although ICG-001 treatment
alone did not cause significant cell death in either line, treatment sensitized both K562 and
EM2 cells to IM-induced apoptosis after ICG-001 treatment (Supplementary Figure S4B).
ICG-001 treatment also significantly decreased CFC capacity and the side population
(Supplementary Figure S4C and D).
We also evaluated the effects of ICG-001 on cell differentiation. Treatment of K562 cells
with ICG-001 for 3 days increased the cell surface expression of myeloid and
megakaryocyte markers examined – CD11b, CD16, CD33, CD56 and CD41 (Figure 3e).
Taken together, the data demonstrates that ICG-001 by disrupting the CBP/catenin

interaction initiates a differentiative pathway with upregulation of BCR-ABL expression,
thereby improving the efficacy of BCR-ABL antagonists.

Long term and secondary engraftment are hallmarks of both LICs and normal hematopoietic
stem cells. To examine the ability of a CBP/catenin antagonist to eliminate drug-resistant
LICs, we performed a series of experiments. We marked EM2 cells with a lentiviral
luciferase expression vector, and then treated these cells in vitro with either ICG-001 or
DMSO for 5 days prior to engraftment in NSG mice. ICG-001 and DMSO treated EM2 cells
were subcutaneously transplanted into the first generation recipients. The transplanted cells
were viable and proliferative as judged by imaging (Figure 3f). After 20 days, 5×104
leukemia cells were recovered from the engrafted primary recipients and transplanted into
the bone marrow of secondary recipients. In the DMSO control group, the secondary
transplantation was uniformly successful (4/4) and all of the mice were dead by day 53. In
stark contrast, none of the mice in the ICG-001 pretreated group successfully engrafted,
even after extended periods of observation (128 days) (Figure 3f). This data demonstrates
that after only 5 days of in vitro treatment with ICG-001, the LIC population had been
eliminated as judged by the lack of bone marrow engraftment, even though leukemic cell
viability was seemingly not affected, based on in vivo imaging at day 20. This suggests that
ICG-001 treatment eliminates the LIC population by differentiating the LIC to “bulk” CML
cells, without killing this “bulk” population.

Author Manuscript

Furthermore, even allowing the cells to proliferate untreated for 20 days subcutaneously in
vivo, there were no evidence of non-LICs reverting to an LIC phenotype. This experiment,
together with previous studies with the CBP/catenin antagonist ICG-001, at least partially
addresses concerns about the plasticity of the CSC/LIC phenotype and their therapeutic
elimination.20,37,43 However, as this experiment consisted of an in vitro pretreatment,
concerns regarding the potential deleterious effects of CBP/catenin antagonists on the
normal hematopoietic stem cell pool still needed to be addressed.
CBP/Catenin Antagonism Safely Eliminates CML LIC In Vivo

Author Manuscript

To alleviate these concerns and to monitor leukemia engraftment and progression in vivo, we
marked K562 cells with the lentiviral luciferase expression vector and transplanted these
cells into the bone marrow of NSG mice. Leukemia engraftment was detected by day 13 and
subsequently the mice were randomized into 3 treatment groups – PBS only (control), PBS
plus Nilotinib, and ICG-001 plus Nilotinib (Figure 4a). The second generation and more
potent TKI Nilotinib was utilized in this experiment, due to its enhanced bioavailability in
mice compared to IM.44 All groups received one 28-day course of treatment (from posttransplantation day 13 to day 41). At the end of this treatment period, the control PBS
treated mice showed continuously increasing levels of luciferase activity, whereas the
luciferase signal in the PBS/Nilotinib as well as the ICG-001/Nilotinib treated groups had
decreased to baseline levels (Figure 4a). However, by day 63, approximately 20 days after
treatment had stopped, the luciferase signal in the PBS/Nilotinib group was detectable again,
and the signal continued to increase (Figure 4a). This result was not surprising, and has also
been observed clinically after cessation of treatment, as BCR-ABL antagonists are not able
to eliminate the CML LIC population.4 In sharp contrast, the ICG-001/Nilotinib

combination treatment group continued to show baseline luciferase levels, with no increase
in luciferase signals even at the termination of monitoring.
The median life span post CML transplantation in the Nilotinib treated group was 235 days
versus 73 days in the PBS control group. Nilotinib-only treated mice demonstrated
significantly increased survival when compared to the PBS control-treated animals.
However, all the mice in the PBS control group, as well as the Nilotinib only group were
dead by Day 110 and Day 260 post transplantation, respectively (Figure 4b). Importantly, in
the ICG-001/Nilotinib combination-treated group, all the mice survived significantly longer
than the Nilotinib-only treated group. All the mice in the ICG-001/Nilotinib combination
treatment group have essentially the same lifespan as their healthy littermate controls, which
had never been engrafted with leukemia (Figure 4b).

Author Manuscript

To confirm the absence of the BCR-ABL transcripts in the peripheral blood of the ICG-001/
Nilotinib combination-treated mice, PCR was performed using samples that were collected
330 days after cessation of treatment. As shown, no BCR-ABL transcripts were detectable in
the combination-treated group (Figure 4c, lanes 1–5). Importantly, the mice from the
ICG-001/Nilotinib combination treatment group also exhibited a normal hematopoietic
profile as judged by red blood cell, white blood cell, platelet counts and hemoglobin
measurements, similar to and essentially all within the normal range compared with their
age matched, non-irradiated, non-engrafted, non-treated control littermates (Figure 4d).

Author Manuscript

Finally, we engrafted two primary human CML patient samples into NSG mice. Having
confirmed the engraftment based upon FACS analysis at day 14 (Supplementary Figure S5),
mice were randomized to Nilotinib or Nilotinib plus ICG-001 treatment groups, and a 28
day course of treatment was initiated. Similar to the results observed with the engrafted
K562 cells, the combination treatment of ICG-001/Nilotinib demonstrated significant
improvement in overall survival compared to the mice in the Nilotinib only group. The
median survival time for the first Nilotinib only group was 108 days. However, all the mice
in the ICG-001/Nilotinib group were still alive at the time of sacrifice almost 200 days post
bone marrow transplantation, indicating the combination treatment significantly extended
life span (p=0.0018) (Figure 4e, lower panel). The second sample group provided similar
results. 190 days post leukemia transplantation, only 1 of 5 mice in the Nilotinib only group
survived (median survival 169 days), while 5 of 6 mice in the ICG-001/Nilotinib treated
group survived (p=0.045, Figure 4e, upper panel).

Discussion
Author Manuscript

The ability to safely eliminate the drug resistant LIC population, without damaging
endogenous normal stem cell populations, is critical to the development of more effective
chemotherapeutic strategies and the complete elimination of leukemia. We have recently
reported that selective disruption of the CBP/β- and γ-catenin interactions using ICG-001
leads to differentiation of pre-B-ALL cells and loss of self-renewal capacity in primary drug
resistant patient samples.20 Similarly, ICG-001 initiates the differentiation of salivary gland
tumor propagating cells in a mouse genetic model (Gain of Function Wnt signaling /Loss of

genes in vitro.19

Author Manuscript

In this paper, we demonstrate that ICG-001 by specifically antagonizing the interaction
between CBP and catenin in CML, results in the initiation of a differentiative pathway. This
is manifested by the increased expression of the myeloid and megakaryocyte differentiation
markers – CD11b, CD16, CD33, CD56 and CD41 (Figure 3e). CBP/catenin antagonists e.g.
ICG-001, being initiators of differentiation are not cytotoxic and therefore only very limited
apoptosis is observed when used as a single agent (Supplementary Table 1). The forced
differentiation of LICs leads to decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene survivin and
a concomitant increase in expression of the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, a hallmark of CML.
These combined observed effects on LICs after treatment with ICG-001 – including
downregulation of survivin and upregulation of BCR-ABL – are associated with elimination
via forced differentiation of quiescent LICs into a “bulk” CML population that is sensitive to
BCR-ABL antagonists, thereby enabling the complete elimination of the leukemia.
CML patient samples similarly show that ICG-001 leads to decreased survivin expression,
particularly in the IM resistant but also albeit less, in the IM sensitive population. Pretreatment of CML cells in vitro with ICG-001 eliminated, essentially irreversibly,37 the LIC
population, as judged by the lack of bone marrow engraftment into NSG mice, even though
this pre-treatment did not decrease cell viability (Figure 3f). Importantly, ICG-001 in
combination with Nilotinib, can safely eliminate engrafted leukemia of both primary CML
patient samples, as well as K562 cells, in NSG mice, without any apparent deleterious
effects to the normal endogenous hematopoietic stem cell population, as judged by normal
hematopoietic parameters and normal life span.

We have shown that ICG-001, a specific CBP/catenin antagonist, by inhibiting the
interaction between catenins and CBP, results in transient increased binding of p300/catenin,
leading to the initiation of a differentiative pathway (Supplementary Figure S1).27,28
Treatment with CBP/catenin antagonist leads to the differentiation of tumor initiating cells
(TICs), as well as the downregulation of survivin levels. This renders the differentiated
progeny sensitive to current chemotherapeutic agents. Modulation of this fundamentally
critical and evolutionarily (at least from mouse to human) highly conserved protein/protein
interaction decision point in stem cells27,28,31,45 may provide a unique advantage in regards
to drug resistance. Translationally, the unique ability of CBP/catenin antagonists to initiate
the differentiation of drug resistant tumor initiating cells in multiple mouse models (genetic
and primary patient cell engraftment) without any apparent deleterious effects on the normal
endogenous stem cell populations, provides a new paradigm to effectively treat and
eliminate TICs in a wide range of malignancies.46,47

has proven extremely safe in both IND enabling toxicology studies and in a Phase Ia clinical
trial. In the IND enabling toxicology study, the NOAEL (no adverse effect dose level) in
dogs given continuous i.v. administration for 28 days was 120 mg/kg/day with sustained
plasma levels > than 200 times the IC50. Furthermore, in the Phase Ia clinical trial for solid
tumors, no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached with escalation from 40–1280

mg/m2/day with continuous infusion i.v. for 7 days. In addition, an inverse relationship was
observed between dose level and survivin/BIRC5 expression in patient circulating tumor
cells.48 The results reported here, in conjunction with the safety of CBP/catenin antagonists
in the clinic to date, augur well for a new therapeutic paradigm to safely eliminate drug
resistant tumor initiating cells. Clinical studies to evaluate this strategy are currently
underway (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01606579).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and CML patient samples

Author Manuscript

Human CML cell lines K562, K562R (IM resistant), EM2 and M2–10B4 stromal cells were
purchased from ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies Inc., Grand
Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan UT,
USA). Cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. K562R cells were
cultured with medium containing 1µM IM. For in vivo studies, both EM2 and K562 cells
were labeled with a lentiviral vector expressing firefly luciferase and GFP with pCCL-cMNDU3c-LUC-PGK-EGFP viral supernatant. For high titer production of viral supernatant,
the lentiviral expression plasmid was cotransfected using calcium chloride precipitation into
HEK293T cells together with plasmid pMDG and pCMVΔ8.91. Transduced EM2 and K562
cells were FACS sorted for GFP bright population.

Author Manuscript

All samples from CML patients (bone marrow or peripheral blood) were obtained with
written informed consent and the study was conducted according to the regulations of the
institutional review board of the University of Southern California, Keck School of
Medicine. 6 BC, 5 IM resistant, and 9 CP patients’ samples were used in the study. Detailed
de-identified patients’ information is summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Primary CML
cells were cultured in QBSF-60 medium (Quality Biological Inc, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)
at a seeding concentration of 1–1.5×106/ml. Dead cells were removed using a dead cell
removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA, USA) before treatment.
CFC assay and SP cell assay
Stromal cells were irradiated at 8000rad and then plated at 3×105 per well in 6 well plates.
Then 1000 sorted IM-resistant (IM-R) or IM-sensitive (IM-S) cells were co-cultured with
stromal cells in Stem Pro-34 SFM (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA)
supplemented with the following human growth factors: Arg-1 100ng/ml, TPO 300ng/ml,
Flt3 300ng/ml, SCF 300ng/ml, GCSF 10ng/ml, IL-3 10ng/ml, IL-6 10ng/ml (PeproTech,
Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). Cells were recovered for BCR-ABL expression or CFC assay.

Author Manuscript

CFC assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were
plated in triplicate on dishes containing methylcellulose medium (Methocult H4435,
StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Cells were pre-treated with different
compounds or different compounds were added into the methylcellulose medium and 1000
(DMSO) to 2000 (ICG-001, or IM or ICG-001/IM) cells were plated. The plates were
incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Total colony numbers were counted 14 days after plating.

Side population assay was performed as previous described.49 Cells were pre-treated with
DMSO or ICG-001 (10µM) for 24 h before SP assay analysis was performed.
FACS analysis/sorting

Author Manuscript

Antibodies and isotype controls for immunostaining were purchased from eBioscience (San
Diego, CA, USA): anti-human CD45 (clone 2D1, Cat# 8011-9459), CD11b (clone 1CRF44,
Cat#47-0118), CD16 (clone CB16, Cat#9011-0168), CD33 (clone HIM3-4, Cat#12-0339),
CD56 (clone CMSSB, Cat#17-0567), CD41 (clone HIP8, Cat#9011-0419) and CD61 (VIPL2, Cat#17-0619), anti-BrdU (clone BU20A, Cat#11-5071), anti-ki67 (20Raj1,
Cat#12-5699). Cell staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
analyzed with a BD LSR Fortessa. To sort IM-R and IM-S cells, CML samples were treated
with IM (1 or 5µM) for 4–6 days after which the cells were sorted using a BD AriaII Flow
Cytometer. Annexin V and Caspase 3 analyses were performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA).
Synthesis of ICG-001
ICG-001 was synthesized as previously described.24
RNA isolation and Real-time PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s
instructions and then treated with DNase before cDNA synthesis (iScript TM cDNA
synthesis kit, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Quantitative real time PCR was performed with
the SYBR Green PCR Master mix kit (Bio-Rad) using the following primers: Human
survivin F 5’-AGCCCTTTCAAGGACCAC-3’, R 5’GGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTC-3’; BCR-ABL F 5’GAGTCTCCGGGGCTCTATGG, R 5’- GCCGCTGAAGGGCTTTTGAA, human GusB F
5’- CGTCCCACCTAGAATCTGCT, R 5’- TTGCTCACAAAGGTCACAGG, human
GAPDH F 5’-GGTGCTGAGTATGTCGTGGA, R 5’-ACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGT. All
results were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH or Gus-B and expression was
compared to control treated cells. Quantitation of gene expression was based on the cycle
threshold (Ct) value for each sample. Delta Ct was calculated as (gene of interest Ct)(housekeeping gene Ct). The relative quantity of mRNA expression was calculated by deltadelta Ct calculation as (treated sample delta Ct)-(control sample delta Ct). All experiments
included negative controls consisting of no cDNA for each primer pair. Data represent the
mean of at least two independent experiments (± S. D.).
Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting

Author Manuscript

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously.24
Briefly, cell lysates (50 – 100µg protein) were incubated with protein A agarose (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) for 1h. The precleared samples were then incubated
with specific antibodies at 4°C overnight. Normal rabbit IgG was used as negative control.
Protein A agarose beads were incubated with protease inhibitors. The immunocomplexes
were washed and separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Invitrogen, CA) and
analyzed by immunoblot. The antibodies utilized were CBP/p300 (Santa Cruz, SC-32244),

anti-β-catenin (BD Bioscience, Cat# 610153) and anti-γ-catenin (BD Bioscience, Cat#
610253). Antibodies for immunoblotting (50 µg total protein) were anti-BCR-ABL (clone
131), anti-CBP (clone SC-369), anti-p300 (clone SC-584), anti-survivin (clone SC-10811),
all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA). Anti-α-tubulin (clone CP06)
was from Calbiotech (Spring Valley, CA). UN-SCAN-IT software was used to quantify the
protein bands normalized to α-tubulin.
ChiP analysis of CBP/p300 occupancy at the human survivin promoter

Author Manuscript

ChiP analysis was performed as previously described.10 In brief, K562 cells were cultured in
T25 flasks with approximately 15 million cells in 10ml of complete growth medium
containing DMSO, 10µM, or 20µM ICG-001 for 24 hours prior to cross-linking with 1%
formaldehyde. Cells were then lysed and sonicated. Normal IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-2027), antiCBP ( A22, Santa Cruz, sc-369) or anti-p300 (N15, Santa Cruz, sc-584) were then added to
the sheared chromatin. After 24 hours, agarose beads were added and DNA was eluted from
beads. 1/10 of the elution was used for qPCR analysis on a BioRad MyIQ real time PCR
detection system. The occupancy of CBP or p300 at the survivin promoter was determined
by the Fold Enrichment Method (ThermoFisher Science, ChiP analysis). The primers used
in the study were: forward: hu-Survivin ChIP-F 5’-CTC CAG GAC TCA AGT GAT GC-3’;
and reverse hu-Survivin ChIP-R 5’-CCG CGG CCT TCT GGG AGT AG-3’
Animal studies

Author Manuscript

All animal studies were approved by the USC institutional IACUC committee. NOD.CgPrkdcscidil2rgtm1wji/SzJ (NSG) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and
subsequently bred and maintained at the University of Southern California animal facility.
Female mice at age 8–10 weeks were used in the study. Animals were randomly assigned to
each treatment group. Investigators were not blinded in the animal studies. Transduced EM2
or K562 cells were injected via tail vein into sublethally irradiated (300 cGy) NSG mice.
Under general anesthesia with isoflurane, leukemia progression was monitored via in vivo
utilizing an IVIS 100 bioluminescence/optical imaging system (Xenogen Corporation,
Alameda, CA, USA). D-luciferin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) dissolved in PBS was
injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 2.5mg/mouse, 15 min before luminescence signal
measurement. After confirmation of leukemia engraftment, mice received either saline/
saline, Nilotinib/saline (100mg/Kg/day) or a combination of ICG-001 (50mg/Kg/day) and
Nilotinib (100mg/Kg/day) treatment.

Author Manuscript

For the primary CML patients’ sample study, leukemia cells were injected via tail vein into
300 cGy irradiated NSG mice and blood was collected for FACS analysis of human CD45
positive leukemia cells after 14 days to confirm leukemia engraftment. At the end of the
experiment, the mice were sacrificed and bone marrow, blood, and spleen were collected for
FACS analysis of human CD45 positive cells. To measure blood counts, mouse blood was
collected in BD microtainer tubes with EDTA and analyzed with a Hemavet (Drew
Scientific Inc, Miami, FL). ICG-001 was delivered via Alzet osmotic minipump (model
1004, Alzet, Cupertino, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

(A) Primary CML cells were cultured in QBSF-60 serum free medium with or without IM
(1µM) for 6–12 days. Cells were then analyzed by FACS for cell viability (DAPI was used
for dead cell exclusion). The IM resistant population in all primary CML samples tested was
consistently DAPI negative, low forward and low side scatter (DAPIneg/Flow/Slow). The IM
sensitive population was DAPI negative, but demonstrated both higher forward and side
scatter (DAPIneg/Fhi/Shi) (upper panel). Cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide showed
that there were approximately 65 times more cells in S phase of the cell cycle in the IM

sensitive population (13%) compared to the IM resistant cell population (0.2%). This
analysis also demonstrated that 72% of the sensitive population was in G0/G1 phase
compared to the IM resistant cell population in which 96% of the cells were in G0/G1 phase
(lower panel). Representative results from a BC patient sample are shown. Similar results
were obtained from 3 CML patient samples (Supplementary Table 2).
(B) After culture with IM for 6–12 days, CML cells were labeled with BrdU and stained for
BrdU incorporation and Ki67 expression. The results confirm the quiescent nature of the IM
resistant population. Representative results from 1 of 3 CML patient samples analyzed are
presented.
(C) After IM treatment for 6 days, cells were sorted and quantitative qRT-PCR for BCRABL was performed on cells from both the IM sensitive and IM resistant populations. The
result presented is based upon analysis of 3 CML patient samples.
(D) One CML patient’s (BC, IM naïve) cells were treated with IM (5µM) in vitro for 4 days
and subsequently FACS sorted into IM-S and IM-R populations using the gates presented in
Figure 1. The given number (inserted table in Figure 1D) of sorted cells were transplanted
into NSG mice via tail vein injection. 6 months after engraftment, mice were sacrificed and
donor cell (human CD45+) engraftment in bone marrow, blood and spleen was analyzed.
(E) Sorted IM-R cells dramatically upregulate BCR-ABL gene expression when cultured on
stromal cells for 4 days. The result presented is based upon analysis of 3 patient samples.
(F) Freshly sorted IM-R cells do not form colonies in CFC assay, whereas IM-S cells readily
form colonies under the same conditions. Results from 3 patient samples are presented.
(G) After co-culture on stromal cells, IM-R cells readily form colonies in CFC assay.
Results from 3 patient samples are presented.

(A) One CML patient’s cells (BC patient, IM naïve) were treated with IM (1µM) for 4 days
and then sorted into IM-R and IM-S populations for co-immunoprecipitation assay. After coIP with antibodies specific for CBP and p300, the membrane was probed with the following
antibodies: upper panel probed with an antibody recognizing both CBP and p300; the middle
panel was probed with an antibody specific for γ-catenin; the lower panel was probed with
an antibody specific for β-catenin. Only the IM-R and not the IM-S cells demonstrate a
robust interaction between γ-catenin and CBP (middle panel, compare lanes 7 and 5). There

is no detectable β-catenin interaction with either CBP or p300 (lower panel). IP:
immunoprecipitation; IB: immunoblotting.
(B) 48h post ICG-001 (10µM) treatment, FACS sorted IM-R cells demonstrate a significant
increase in BCR-ABL expression, while survivin/BIRC5 expression is significantly downregulated in the IM-R as well as the IM-S cells, albeit less than in the IM-R cells. Result
shown is a summary of 3 CML patient samples.
(C) Representative Annexin V analysis from the results shown in Figure 2D.
(D) ICG-001 pre-treatment results in increased sensitivity to IM induced apoptosis in
primary CML patient samples: 9 CP, 4 BC, 4 IM failed. Each sample was divided into two
wells, one treated with DMSO and the other with ICG-001 at 10µM for 2 days.
Subsequently, Annexin V staining and analysis was used and dead cells were removed. The
live cells were then treated with 0.2µM of IM for 24h and subsequently re-analyzed for
Annexin V expression. There was no significant difference in Annexin V staining between
DMSO and ICG-001 pretreated samples prior to IM treatment (data not shown).
(E) Primary CML cells were treated with ICG-00110µM or DMSO for 2 days.
Subsequently, 500 cells were plated for CFC assay. As shown in the upper panel, ICG-001
treated cells gave significantly less colony formation. When different compounds were
added in methycellulose medium, the combination of ICG-001(5µM) and IM (1µM) almost
completely eliminated colony forming activity (1000 cells per well were plated). Colonies
formed in samples treated with ICG-001alone were significantly smaller (lower panel).
Data are representative of three individual CML patient samples.
(F) Primary patient samples treated with IM (1 µM) and ICG-001 (10 µM) eliminated both
the IM-R and IM-S cells (representative results from 7 different patient samples).
(G) CML cells were cultured in QBSF-60 serum free medium and treated with DMSO or
ICG-001(10 µM) for 24 h. After treatment, side population analysis was performed by
FACS. ICG-001 significantly decreased the SP in primary patient CML samples (V=
Verapamil, Ho=Hoechst 33342, percentage of SP cells is labeled). The result shown is
representative of 3 CML patient samples.

(A) 48h treatment with ICG-001 significantly increases BCR-ABL gene expression in both
K562 and EM2 cells while survivin/BIRC5 gene expression is significantly down regulated.
Results are a summary of three independent experiments.
(B) At the protein level, expression of BCR-ABL is also significantly increased, while
survivin is significantly down-regulated in both K562 and EM2 cells. The bar graphs on the
right represent pixel numbers determined using UN-SCAN-IT software.

(C) In K562R cells, ICG-001 (10µM) treatment for 48h blocks both the β- and γ-catenin
interaction with CBP (compare lanes 4 and 6) while increasing both β- and γ-catenin
interaction with p300 (compare lanes 5 and 7). The upper panel was probed with an
antibody recognizing both CBP and p300; the middle panel was probed with an antibody
specific to γ-catenin; the lower panel was probed with an antibody specific to β-catenin .
(D) K562 cells were treated with DMSO or ICG-001 (either 10µM or 20µM) for 24 hours
for ChiP analysis, using normal IgG, anti-CBP (A22) or anti-p300 (N15). qPCR was
subsequently performed to determine the change in occupancy by CBP and p300 in the
human survivin/BIRC5 proximal promoter region. ICG-001 decreased CBP, but increased
p300 occupancy on the human survivin promoter. The results are the average of two
experiments.
(E) K562 cells were treated with ICG-001 (10µM) for 3 days and then harvested for FACS
analysis of multiple myeloid surface markers (CD11b, CD16, CD33, and CD56) and the
megakaryocyte marker CD41. The light gray peaks represent the DMSO treated samples; the
darker gray peaks represent the ICG-001 treated samples.
(F) EM2 cells marked with a lentiviral luciferase vector were pre-treated in vitro for 5 days
with either DMSO control or ICG-001 (10µM) before being subcutaneously implanted into
primary recipient NSG mice. The implanted cells expanded and were viable in vivo in the
case of both treatments. After 20 days, 5 × 104 cells were recovered from the engrafted
primary recipients and transplanted into the bone marrow of secondary recipient NSG mice
via tail vein injection. In the DMSO group, secondary transplantation was uniformly
successful (4/4) and all of the mice died by day 53. In stark contrast, none of the mice (4/4)
in the ICG-001 pretreated group successfully engrafted even after 128 days of observation.

Figure 4.

(A) K562 cells marked with a lentiviral luciferase vector were engrafted into 15 NSG mice.
Leukemia engraftment was detected at day 13 by bioluminescence imaging and the mice
were subsequently randomized into 3 treatment groups – PBS/PBS, PBS/Nilotinib, and
ICG-001/Nilotinib. ICG-001 or saline (control) was administered via Alzet osmotic
minipump for 28 days. Nilotinib or saline (control) was administered by daily oral gavage.
Leukemia development was monitored by bioluminescence imaging.

(B) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that mice from the ICG-001/Nilotinib
treatment group survived more than 1 year post BMT and essentially as long as their
nonleukemia engrafted, untreated littermates (p=0.0072 between saline and Nilotinib
treament, p=0.0018 between Nilotinib/saline and Nilotinib/ICG-001 group). The control
mice are the experimental mice littermates without leukemia engraftment.
(C) 330 days post treatment stoppage, qRT-PCR analysis for BCR-ABL was performed on
peripheral blood from mice in the ICG-001/Nilotinib treatment group. Assay sensitivity was
determined by serial dilution of K562 cells with mouse blood cells. With as little as 10 K562
cells per 106 mouse cells BCR-ABL can be detected. There was no BCR-ABL detected in
any of the mice from the ICG-001/Nilotinib treatment group.
(D) 330 days post treatment stoppage, blood from the ICG-001/Nilotinib treatment group
mice was analyzed. The green dotted lines indicate the normal range for each parameter
compared to their non-irradiated, non-leukemia engrafted, untreated littermate controls.
(E) Two primary CML patient samples were transplanted into NSG mice and treated with
either Saline/Nilotinib or ICG-001/Nilotinib. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a
significant improvement in survival with the combination treatment.
