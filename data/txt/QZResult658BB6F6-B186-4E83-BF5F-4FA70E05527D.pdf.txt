ABSTRACT
Trastuzumab resistance is leading cause of mortality in HER2-positive breast
cancers, and the role of TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
in trastuzumab resistance is well established, but the involvement of lncRNAs in
trastuzumab resistance is still unknown. Here, we generated trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer cells with increased invasiveness compared with parental cells, and
observed robust epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and consistently elevated
TGF-β signaling in these cells. We identified long noncoding RNA activated by TGF-β (lncATB) was the most remarkably upregulated lncRNA in TR SKBR-3 cells and the tissues of
TR breast cancer patients. We found that lnc-ATB could promote trastuzumab resistance
and invasion-metastasis cascade in breast cancer by competitively biding miR-200c, upregulating ZEB1 and ZNF-217, and then inducing EMT. In addition, we also found that
the high level of lnc-ATB was correlated with trastuzumab resistance of breast cancer
patients. Thus, these findings suggest that lncRNA-ATB, a mediator of TGF-β signaling,
could predispose breast cancer patients to EMT and trastuzumab resistance.

and has paved the way for the era of targeted therapy in
breast cancer treatment, the median duration of response
is modest [6–7]. This is due to either primary or secondary
mechanisms of resistance during the course of treatment
[8–9]. More importantly, only less than 35% of patients
with HER2-positive breast cancer initially respond
to trastuzumab [10–11]. Though a number of critical
studies have been conducted to identify the underlying
mechanisms that account for trastuzumab resistance, little
is known regarding the biological role of long non-coding
RNA (lncRNA) in the process of trastuzumab resistance.
The multifunctional cytokine transforming growth
factor β (TGF-β) orchestrates an intricate signaling
network to modulate carcinogenesis and progression [12].
It has been confirmed that TGF-β signaling could promote
cancer progression and confer resistance to various
therapeutics through enhancing proliferation, migration,
and invasion, in part by its ability to induce epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) [13–15]. EMT has been
proven to correlate closely with cancer progression by

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignance
in women with 232670 newly estimated diagnosed
cases and 40000 estimated deaths in the United States
in 2014 [1]. The leading causes of these deaths are
attributed to distal metastasis and resistance to currently
available therapeutics [2]. Erb2/HER2 is amplified and
overexpressed in 25%–30% of human breast cancers
[3]. HER2-positive breast cancer has the second-poorest
prognosis among breast cancer subtypes and is correlated
with reduced disease-free and overall survival time
[4–5]. Trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genetech, San Francisco,
CA, USA) is designed to target the extra-cellular
domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) and block its function, and is currently used in
patients with early stage and metastatic HER2-positive
breast and gastric cancers. Even though trastuzumabbased combination treatment with chemotherapy has
significantly improved outcome in breast cancer patients

facilitating invasion of cancer cells [16–17]. In breast
cancers, the functional synergy between TGF-β and
HER2 has been characterized. It has been demonstrated
that TGF-β cooperated with HER2 at various levels,
including transcriptional regulation of the Smad target
genes and pathways; activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
in a Smad-independent manner; modification of the tumor
microenvironment by inducing the secretion of TGF-β,
Erb2 ligands, and angiogenic mediators [18]. Given the
established role of EMT in breast cancer progression [19],
deciphering the biological function of TGF-β signaling in
trastuzumab resistance and metastasis of HER2 positive
breast cancer will provide novel insights into molecular
mechanism underlying multifaceted malignant phenotypes
of breast cancer.
LncRNAs are a class of transcripts longer than
200 nucleotides with extremely limited protein coding
potential. Recently, many studies have demonstrated
that lncRNAs had multiple functions in a wide range of
biological process, such as proliferation, apoptosis, cell
migration, and cell invasion [20–21]. Although lncRNAs
have been reported to modulate tumor metastasis by
mediating the prometastatic role of TGF-β and regulating
EMT [22], and several lncRNA transcripts were involved
in the biology of carcinogenesis in breast cancer [23–
24], the biological roles of lncRNAs in the process of
trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer are not well
studied.
In the current study, we screened for candidate
lncRNAs responsible for the maglinant phenotype of
trastuzumab resistant (TR) SKBR-3. We identified long
noncoding RNA activated by TGF-β (lnc-ATB) was the
most remarkably up-regulated lncRNA in TR SKBR-3
cells and the tissues of TR breast cancer patients. We then
focus on the role of lnc-ATB in trastuzumab resistance
and invastion-metastasis cascade of breast cancer. We
found lnc-ATB could promote trastuzumab resistance
and invasion-metastasis cascade in breast cancer by
competitively biding miR-200c, up-regulating ZEB1 and
ZNF-217, and then inducing EMT.

Then, we investigated the difference of malignant
phenotype between TR SKBR-3 cells and WT SKBR-3
cells. Compared with WT SKBR-3 cells, the apoptosis rate
of TR SKBR-3 cells was significantly decreased (Figure
1B). Moreover, the migration and invasion capacity of TR
SKBR-3 cells was significantly increased than WT SKBR3 cells (Figure 1C–1F). Consistent with the morphological
changes of EMT, the epithelial maker E-cadherin was
significantly down-regulated in TR SKBR-3 cells;
meanwhile, the mesenchymal marker Vimentin was
significantly up-regulated in SKBR-3 cells (Figure 1G).
A cluster of EMT markers, including ZEB1, ZEB2, ETS1,
TWIST1, SNAIL1, was significantly increased in TR
SKBR-3 cells (Figure 1H). These results indicated the
acquisition of trastuzumab significantly enhanced the
migration and invasion capacity of breast cancer cells, and
the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is EMT of
breast cancer cells.

Lnc-ATB is up-regulated in TR breast cancer
tissues and TR SKBR-3 cells
LncRNAs has been proven to play critical role in
mediating the prometastatic role of TGF-β and regulating
EMT. We used microarray analysis to compare the lncRNA
expression level between the TR SKBR-3 and WT SKBR3, we found 572 up-regulated and 321 down-regulated
lncRNAs in TR SKBR-3 cells. Then, we used microarray
analysis to compare the lncRNA expression level between
the tissues of 5 WT breast cancer patients and 5 TR breast
cancer patients, we found 421 up-regulated and 245 downregulated lncRNAs in TR breast cancer patients. Among
the 30 lncRNAs with the most significant fold change in
tissues of TR breast cancer patients or TR SKBR-3 cells,
lnc-ATB was found up-regulated in both TR SKBR-3 cells
and tissues of TR breast cancer patients (Figure 2A and
2B). Given the established role of lnc-ATB in invasion
and EMT, we proposed lncATB should account for the
aforementioned changes of malignant phenotypes between
WT SKBR-3 and TR SKBR-3 cells. We then further
confirmed the significant up-regulation of lnc-ATB in TR
SKBR-3 cells (Figure 2C) and tissues of 50 TR breast
cancer patients (Figure 2D).

Induction and identification the phenotype of
trastuzumab resistant SKBR-3 model

Up-regulation of lnc-ATB account for the
trastuzumab resistance and high invasiveness
of TR SKBR-3 cells

In order to develop an in vitro SKBR-3 model of
acquired trastuzumab resistance, SKBR-3 which is HER2 overexpressed breast cancer cell line was continuously
exposed to 5 μg/ml trastuzumab for 6 months until cells
had acquired trastuzumab resistance [25]. Consistent with
previous studies characterizing trastuzumab resistant
breast cancer cells (TR), we observed the growth
inhibition of TR SKBR-3 cells was significantly lower
than WT SKBR-3 cells under the trastuzumab medium
explosion (Figure 1A) [26].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In order to further confirm whether lnc-ATB promo­
tes trastuzumab resistance through regulating EMT, we
performed MTT assays to investigate the effects of lncATB on malignant phenotypes of TR SKBR-3 cells.
Down-regulation of lnc-ATB significantly increased the
growth inhibition of TR SKBR-3 cells under the under the
trastuzumab medium explosion (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
down-regulation of lnc-ATB also significantly increased

importantly, compared with shRNA-control, TR SKBR-3

Taken together, these results indicated lnc-ATB could
promote trastuzumab resistance through increasing the
invasiveness and EMT of breast cancer cells.

important, all these miRNAs had been reported to repress
EMT and tumor invasion by targeting the 3′-UTR of ZEB1,
ZEB2, and ZNF217, etc. Thus, we used microarray analysis
to compare the miRNA expression level between the TR
SKBR-3 and WT SKBR-3, we found 98 up-regulated and
73 down-regulated miRNAs in TR SKBR-3 cells. Then, we
used microarray analysis to compare the miRNA expression
level between the tissues of 5 WT breast cancer patients and
5 TR breast cancer patients, we found 54 up-regulated and
47 down-regulated miRNAs in TR breast cancer patients.
Among the 30 miRNAs with the most significant fold change
in tissues of TR breast cancer patients or TR SKBR-3 cells,
miR-200c was found down-regulated in both TR SKBR3 cells and tissues of TR breast cancer patients (Figure 4A
and 4B), which is consistent with previous studies. We
then further confirmed the significant down-regulation of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

miR-200c in TR SKBR-3 cells (Figure 4C) and tissues
of 50 TR breast cancer patients (Figure 4D). Previous
studies indicated lnc-ATB could function as a ceRNA by
competitively binding miR-200c in hepatocellular carcinoma,
so we investigated the relationship between lnc-ATB and
miR-200c in breast cancer. As predicted, lnc-ATB inversely
correlated with miR-200c expression in the tissues of TR
breast cancer patients (Figure 4E).

Lnc-ATB functions as a ceRNA by competitively
biding miR-200c in TR SKBR-3 cells
To validate the direct binding between miR-200c and
lnc-ATB at endogenous levels, we constructed luciferase
reporters containing 3′ 500nt of lnc-ATB, which contains
wild type (WT) or mutant (MUT) miR-200c binding sites
(Figure 5A). We found overexpression of miR-200c reduced

luciferase activities of WT reporter vector but not mutant
reporter vector (Figure 5B). To determine whether lncATB was regulated by miR-200c, we compared lnc-ATB
expression in TR SKBR-3 cells transfected with miR-200c
mimics or miR-200c control. We found overexpression
of miR-200c did not induced the degradation of lnc-ATB
in TR SKBR-3 cells (Figure 5C), which supporting that
miR-200c was bona fide lnc-ATB-targeting miRNAs. But
when the expression of lnc-ATB was down-regulated, the
expression of miR-200c was corresponding up-regulated
in TR SKBR-3 cells (Figure 5D). These results implied

that lnc-ATB physically associated with miR-200c and
functioned as a ceRNA for miR-200c in TR SKBR-3 cells.

Lnc-ATB up-regulates and positive correlates
with ZEB1 and ZNF217 levels
Because lnc-ATB shares regulatory miR-200c
with ZEB1 and ZNF 217 which has been proven to be
the direct targets of miR-200c in TR SKBR-3 cells, we
wondered whether lnc-ATB could modulate ZEB1 and
ZNF217. We found down-regulation of lnc-ATB could

decrease the expression of ZEB1 and ZNF217 at mRNA
and protein levels in TR SKBR-3 cells (Figure 6A and
6B). Additionally, lnc-ATB significantly correlated
with the expression of ZNF217 and ZEB1 in the tissues
of TR breast cancer patients (P = 0.025 and P < 0.001
respectively; Figure 6C and 6D).

Previous studies demonstrated the trastuzumab
displayed potent inhibition of multi-organ metastasis [27],
and loss of HER2 facilitated distal metastasis of breast
cancer patients receiving trastuzumab treatment [28],
which indicating that trastuzumab resistance significantly
associated with metastasis in breast cancer. Furthermore,
consistent with previous studies, our study also confirmed
acquisition of trastuzumab resistance was characterized
by enhanced invasiveness of breast cancer cells with
concomitant EMT and elevated TGF-β signaling [26]. It
has been demonstrated that lnc-ATB could mediate the
role of TGF-β in induced EMT and promoting metastasis
in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer and breast
cancer, which indicating lnc-ATB was a general TGF-β
mediator. Furthermore, lnc-ATB was also proved to be a
direct target of TGF-β/Smad pathway [22]. Our results
indicated a higher level of lnc-ATB was associated with
trastuzumab resistance in patients with breast cancer,
which is consistent with the observation that elevated

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we reported that lnc-ATB, which
had been reported to be activated by TGF-β, promote
trastuzumab resistance and invasion-metastasis cascade
in breast cancer by competitively biding miR-200c, upregulating ZEB1 and ZNF-217, and then inducing EMT
(Figure 6E). In addition, we also found that the high level
of lnc-ATB was correlated with trastuzumab resistance
of breast cancer patients. All these data support our
conclusion that lnc-ATB has pleiotropic effects on breast
cancer cell invasion, apoptosis, and trastuzumab resistance.

TGF-β signaling is also associated with trastuzumab
resistance. More importantly, we also found miR-200c
was down-regulated in the tissues of trastuzumab resistant
breast cancer patients, and inversely correlated with lncATB expression. It has been confirmed down-regulation
of miR-200c promote invasiveness and EMT of breast
cancer by regulating the expression of ZEB1 and ZNF217.
Taken together our results and previous studies, we get
the conclusion that both lnc-ATB and miR-200c play
important role in the process of EMT and the malignant
phenotype of TR SKBR-3 cells. Interestingly, it has been
confirmed that lnc-ATB was a ceRNA by competitively
binding miR-200c. Our study further confirmed lnc-ATB
could regulate the expression of miR-200c, but miRwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

200c could not induce degradation of lnc-ATB. Thus, our
results further elucidate lnc-ATB physically associate with
miR-200c and function as a ceRNA in breast cancer cells.
Considering the established role of miR-200c in EMT
and trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer, we could
conclude lnc-ATB which is activated by TGF-β modulate
the process of trastuzumab resisitance and metastasis in
HER2 positve breast cancer by regulating the miR200c/
ZEB1 and miR-200c/ZNF217 signaling pathway.
In order to further confirm our hypothesis, we
investigated the relationship between lnc-ATB and
ZEB1/ZNF217. We found lnc-ATB shared miR-200c
response elements with ZEB1 which was the master
inducers of EMT and ZNF217 which promoted TGF-β
11659

by transcriptionally activating TGF-β2 and TGF-β3
[29–30]. We observed down-regulated lnc-ATB was
sufficient to reduce the expression of ZEB1 and ZNF217
in TR SKBR-3 cells. Notably, this role depends on the
competitive binding with miR-200c, further indicating
lnc-ATB functions as a ceRNA in breast cancer cells.
Because there is a double negative feedback loop between
miR-200c and ZEB1/ZNF217 [31], the upregulation of
ZEB1 and ZNF217 by lnc-ATB could further augment
the effects. More importantly, the expression of lnc-ATB
was significantly associated with ZEB1 and ZNF217
expression in TR breast cancer patients. All these results
proved lnc-ATB functions as a ceRNA by regulating ZEB1
and ZNF217 expression in breast cancer.
ZNF 217 is a candidate oncogene in breast cancer, and
overexpression of ZNF217 was found to promote migration
and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and stimulate the
development of spontaneous lung or lymph node metastasis
in vivo. More importantly, ZNF was confirmed to promote
EMT and mediate direct up-regulation of TGF-β2 and
TGF-β3 in autocrine loop [29]. HER2 converts TGF-β from
a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter, and exogenous as
well as transduced TGF-β confers motility and invasiveness
to MCF10A nontransformed human mammary epithelial
cells stably expressing transfected HER2 [32–33]. And
GDF15-mediated activation of TGF beta receptor-SrcHER2 signaling crosstalk was reported to be a novel
mechanism of trastuzumab resistance [34]. Taken together
previous studies and our results, we tend to confirm lncATB could augment its effects on trastuzumab resistance
in breast cancer by lnc-ATB/ZNF217/TGF-β positive
feedback. Thus, it is more prone to develop trastuzumab
resistance in the breast cancer patients whose lnc-ATB
expression was elevated.
More and more miRNAs have been proven to be
associated with trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer.
Specifically, miR-21 and miR-200c were confirmed to
mediate trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer [25–26].
More importantly, nested feedback circuits of miR-200c/
ZEB1 and miR-200c/ZNF217/TGF-β/ZEB1 contribute to
EMT correlated with trastuzumab resistance and metastasis
of breast cancers. Our studies expanded this regulatory
circuit and identified an important role of lnc-ATB in
this circuit. On one hand, the negative feedback between
ZEB1 and miR-200c may be more complicated than we
currently know. Lnc-ATB may be function as a ceRNA to
up-regulate the ZEB1 expression in breast cancer. On the
other hand, lnc-ATB could enlarge its effect on trastuzumab
resistance and EMT of breast cancer by lnc-ATB/ZNF217/
TGF-β signaling pathway. Thus, up-regulation of miR-200c
alone may not sufficient to reverse trastuzumab resistance
in breast cancer. Therefore, nested feedback circuits
of lnc-ATB/miR-200c/ZEB1 and lnc-ATB/miR-200c/
ZNF217/TGF-β/ZEB1 contribute to EMT correlated with
trastuzumab resistance and metastasis of breast cancer.

Taken together, our research demonstrated that lncATB acts as a key regulator of TGF-β signaling pathways
and restuzumab resistance in breast cancer. The findings
of this study have significant implications regarding our
understanding the mechanism of EMT and trastuzumab
resistance in breast cancer. As direct targets of lnc-ATB,
miR-200c-ZEB1/ZNF217 mediated the role of lnc-ATB in
trastuzumab resistance and invasion-metastasis cascade.
The pleiotropic effects of lnc-ATB on the trastuzumab
resistance and invasion-metastasis cascade suggest that
lnc-ATB could be an effective target for anti-metastasis
and reversal of trastuzumab resistance therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human breast cancer SKBR-3 cell line was purchased
from the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China), where they were characterized by
mycoplasma detection, DNA-Fingerprinting, isozyme
detection and cell vitality detection. Cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Hyclone, Logan, UT) and maintained at 37°C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Recombinant
TGF-β2 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and Docetaxel
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis) were used for incubation
with cells at working concentrations of 20 ng/ml and
4 nM, respectively. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was obtained
from Roche (Basel, Switzerland) and dissolved in sterile
water. Trastuzumab-resistant (TR) cells were developed
by continuous culture of SKBR-3 cells in the presence of
5 mg/ml trastuzumab for 6 months as reported.17 Thereafter,
TR and parental (WT) SKBR-3 cells were cultured in
parallel with or without trastuzumab, respectively.

Microarray analysis
The total RNA was extracted from above mentioned
TR or WT SKBR-3 cells and breast cancer patients, amplified
and transcribed into fluorescent cRNA using the Quick Amp
Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The
labeled cRNA was then hybridized onto the Human LncRNA
Array v2.0 (8 x 60K, ArrayStar, Rockville, MD), and after the
washing steps, the arrays were scanned by the Agilent Scanner
G2505B. Agilent Feature Extraction software (version
10.7.3.1) was used to analyze acquired array images. Quantile
normalization and subsequent data processing were performed
using the GeneSpring GX v11.5.1 software package (Agilent
Technologies). The differentially expressed lncRNAs and
miRNAs with statistical significance were identified using
volcano plot filtering. The thresholds we used to screen upregulated or down-regulated lncRNAs and miRNAs are fold
change > = 1.5 and a p-value < = 0.05. Gene expression

profiles were determined using Phalanx human OneArray
microarrays (HOA 6.1) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

MTT assay
Cell proliferation was analyzed in vitro with
the tetrazolium salt 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent. Briefly,
2000 cells from each group were plated in each well of
five 96-well plates in 200 μL of medium. To analyze cell
proliferation, 20 μL of MTT substrate at a concentration
of 2.5 mg / mL in PBS was added to each well. The plates
were then returned to a standard tissue incubator for an
additional 4 h. The medium was then removed, and the
cells were solubilized in 150 μL of dimethylsulfoxide
for the colorimetric analysis (wavelength, 490 nm). One
plate was analyzed immediately after the cells adhered
(approximately 4 h after plating). Then, one plate per day
was examined for the next 4 consecutive days.

Western blot analysis
Cells were washed in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) twice before proteins were extracted, and proteins
were separated on a SDS/PAGE gel, transferred onto
a PVDF membrane and subjected to immunoblot
analysis. Blotting was performed with antibodies against
E-cadherin (ab53226, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), vementin
(ab8978, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), ZEB1 (ab180905,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK), ZNF217 (ab136678, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse
immunoglobulin horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab)2
fragments (ZAGB-bio, Beijing, China) were used as
secondary antibodies.

Apoptosis assay
TR SKBR-3 cells were transfected with lnc-ATB
shRNA and shRNA control for 48 h, and the cells were
then suspended in incubation buffer at a density of 1 × 106
cells / mL. The cells were incubated with Annexin V-FITC
and propidium iodide (PI) (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA)
for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Cell apoptosis
was then analyzed using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA, USA).

Luciferase reporter assay
pmirGLO-ATB-WT or pmirGLO-ATB-MUT(miR200c) was coransfected with miR-200c mimics or miR NC
into 293T cells by Lipofectamine-mediated gene transfer.
The relative luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla
luciferase activity 48 hr after transfection.

Migration and invasion assay
Cell migration and invasion capacity were measured
using transwell migration assays (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) in vitro. The TR SKBR-3 cells were transfected with
lnc-ATB shRNA and shRNA control for 48 h, and then
the cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 with 10 g/L BSA
at a density of 1X106 cells / mL. Then, cell suspensions
(150 μL) were seeded in the upper chamber with aporous
membrane coated with (for the transwell invasion assay)
or without (for the migration assay) Matrigel (BD
Bioscience, San Diego, CA). To attract the cells, 500 μL
of RPMI-1640 with 10% serum was added to the bottom
chamber. After allowing the cells to migrate for 24 h
or to invade for 48 h, the penetrated cells on the filters
were fixed in dried methanol and stained in 4 g/L crystal
violet. The numbers of migrated or invasive cells were
determined from five random fields using a microscope
(Olympus) at × 10 magnification.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM
SPSS statistical software (version 21.0). The differences
in characteristics between the 2 groups were examined
by the χ2 test and Fisher’s exact test. All P-values were
determined from 2-sided tests, and statistical significance
was based on a P-value of 0.05.

Patients and specimens
This study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of No.202 of PLA. Written informed consent
was obtained from all of the patients. All specimens were
handled and made anonymous according to the ethical
and legal standards. 50 cases of herceptin-sensitive
and herceptin-resistant breast cancer patients based
on accepted clinicopathological were enrolled in this
study. The inclusion criteria of herceptin-resistant breast
cancer patients were as following: 1, primary herceptinresistance: the condition of patients who recieved initial
trastuzumab treatment (12 weeks or less) progressed; 2,
secondary herceptin-resistance: the condition of patients

Quantitative RT-PCR for miRNAs and mRNAs
