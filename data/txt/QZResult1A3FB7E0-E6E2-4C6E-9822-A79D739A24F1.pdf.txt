ABSTRACT:

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), the major transcription factor specifically
activated during hypoxia, regulates genes involved in critical aspects of cancer
biology, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, glycolysis and invasion. The HIF1a subunit is stabilized by low oxygen, genetic alteration and cobaltous ions, and
its over-expression correlates with drug resistance and increased cancer mortality
in various cancer types, therefore representing an important anticancer target. Zinc
supplementation has been shown to counteract the hypoxic phenotype in cancer
cells, in vitro and in vivo, hence, understanding the molecular pathways modulated
by zinc under hypoxia may provide the basis for reprogramming signalling pathways
for anticancer therapy. Here we performed genome-wide analyses of colon cancer
cells treated with combinations of cobalt, zinc and anticancer drug and evaluated
the effect of zinc on gene expression patterns. Using Principal Component
Analysis we found that zinc markedly reverted the cobalt-induced changes of gene
expression, with reactivation of the drug-induced transcription of pro-apoptotic
genes. We conclude that the hypoxia pathway is a potential therapeutic target
addressed by zinc that also influences tumor cell response to anticancer drug.

INTRODUCTION

(PHD1-3) at key proline residues in the oxygen-dependent
degradation domain (ODD) facilitating interaction
with the E3 ligase, Von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL),
which drives HIF-1a ubiquitination and degradation [2,
3]. Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylation is
inhibited, thereby stabilizing HIF-1a and EPAS1 (also
known as HIF-2α), which can then translocate to the
nucleus and bind to constitutively expressed HIF-1b
forming the active HIF-1 complex [4]. In a screen from the
National Toxicology Program [5], three out of 1408 tested
compounds (o-phenantroline, IodoChlorohydroxiquinone

Hypoxia is a common state of cancer cells due to
the lack of blood supply to the rapidly growing tumor.
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is the key factor
that mediates adaptive response to hypoxia; it is an
heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of the
HIF-1b subunit, constitutively expressed in cells, and
the HIF-1a subunit whose stability is enhanced by low
intracellular oxygen and also by genetic alteration [1]. In
normoxia, HIF-1a is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases

and cobalt sulfate) were selected as hypoxia-mimetic
whereas cobalt was the only one that interacted with
HIF-1 in a manner similar to hypoxia. Thus, cobaltous
ions have been shown to inhibit hydroxylation of HIF1a and therefore induce elevated HIF-1a protein levels,

mimicking hypoxia [1]. The interest in HIF-1 comes form
the fact that HIF-1 controls the expression of numerous
genes involved in many aspects of cancer progression,
including angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth
factor - VEGF), metabolic adaptation (e.g., Glut1),
apoptosis resistance (e.g., Bcl2), invasion and metastasis
(e.g., c-Met) [6]. The levels of HIF-1a subunit are often
increased in most solid human tumors including colon,
brain, breast, gastric, lung, skin, ovarian, prostate,
renal, and pancreatic carcinoma, rendering tumor cells
resistant to conventional chemotherapy and selecting
a more malignant and invasive phenotype leading to
poor prognosis [6]. Inhibition of HIF-1a may, therefore,
represent an attractive strategy with potential for
synergism with other antitumor therapies [7, 8].

metastatic and invasive cells, that eventually lead the
tumors to relapse as a more invasive and metastatic
disease [10, 11]. Similar results may apply also for the
treatment with antibodies when the signaling triggered
by the antibody affects the HIF-1 pathway [12]. Zinc is
a trace element that is essential for the normal function
of cells and is a cofactor for a wide range of structural
proteins, enzymes, and transcription factors involved in
key cellular functions such as the response to oxidative
stress, DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression and
apoptosis [13]. The mechanisms through which gene
expression is regulated by zinc are central to cellular
homeostasis, thus, zinc is an essential prerequisite for the
execution of many signaling pathways in eukaryotes [14].
Preclinical studies have shown that zinc exerts a positive
beneficial effect against chemically induced pre-neoplastic
progression in rats and provides an effective dietary
chemopreventive approach to disease [15]. On the other
hand, zinc deficiency has been associated with induction
of cancer [16]. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies
by our group have shown that zinc supplementation to
cancer cells improves the chemotherapeutic response with
reactivation, for instance, of inactive onco-suppressor
p53 and apoptosis [17, 18]. Understanding the molecular
pathways modulated by zinc under hypoxia may provide
the basis for reprogramming signalling pathways for
anticancer therapy and hopefully improve classical
anticancer therapies. To this aim, we performed a genomewide expression analysis in colon cancer cells treated with
different combinations of hypoxia-mimetic cobalt, zinc
and anticancer drug. Our strategy identified differences
in gene expression among the combination treatments.
The most remarkable result was that zinc reversed gene
expression of most genes modulated by hypoxia, including
genes involved in metabolism, proteasomal build-up, and
amino acid biosynthesis. As a result of hypoxic phenotype
reversion, zinc supplementation restored the drug-induced
apoptosis, inhibited by hypoxia. Our studies suggest that
zinc supplementation to cancer cells may have an effective
anticancer outcome by targeting the hypoxia pathway and
therefore provide the molecular basis for the combination
treatment of tumors by zinc with classical anti-tumoral
drugs.

Expression of the modulated genes shared
between cobalt and hypoxia
Low oxygen as well as cobaltous ions inhibit
hydroxylation of HIF-1a and therefore induce elevated
HIF-1a protein levels, mimicking hypoxia [1]. Here, we
first attempted to evaluate the extent of similarity in gene
expression between cobalt and hypoxia treatment by

constructing a list of hypoxia genes using hypoxia related
gene sets that were published on the MSigDB database
[19 by ten different studies [20-29]. This resulted in
150 up-regulated (hypoxia up) and 76 down-regulated
(hypoxia down) genes that appeared in at least two out
of the ten hypoxia studies (data not shown). When the
150 and 76 modulated genes were intersected with the
modulated genes in the cobalt (C) treatment of RKO cells
(Supplementary Table S1), the resulting shared genes
were found to be 54 out of the 150 ‘hypoxia up’, and 12
out of the 76 ‘hypoxia down’ genes (Table 1, column C-0).
This significant overlap is in agreement with many studies
on hypoxia-like effect by cobalt, showing high level of
similarity in modulated genes between hypoxia and cobalt
treatment [30, 31].
Among the shared ‘hypoxia up’ genes we identified
genes involved in carbohydrates metabolism, fructose,
mannose, and glycolysis, (i.e., SLC2A1, also known as
GLUT1, PGM1, ALDOA, ALDOC, PFKFB3, PFKFB4,
GYS1, GBE1, HK2, ENO2 and PGK1), genes involved
in oxidoreductase activity (i.e., SCD, P4HA2, P4HA1,

HMOX1 and EGLN1), in autophagy and tumor cell
survival (i.e., BNIP3L) [32], in pH regulation (i.e.,
CA9) [33] in multidrug resistance (i.e., ABCB6) [34] in
cell survival and proliferation (i.e., ADM, cyclin G2), in
angiogenesis (i.e., EGLN1, ANG and ANGPTL4). We
also found newly identified HIF-1a target genes such
as TMEM45A, ANKRD37 and WSB1 [35], the latter
one being involved in ubiquitination and degradation
of HIPK2 [36], a putative tumor suppressor and p53
apoptotic regulator [37] that is down-regulated in hypoxia
[38], supporting the hypoxia-mimetic function of cobalt.
Since we recently showed that the hypoxic phenotype
can be inhibited by zinc supplementation to cancer cells
[9, 17], we next evaluated the effect of zinc treatment
on the cobalt modulated genes. Interestingly, we found
that zinc markedly reverted the differential expression
of genes shared between hypoxia and cobalt (Table 1,
column ZC-C), in support of our biological results [9,
17]. Although some of the up- and down-regulated genes
were reversed by less than 1.5 fold change, the expression
levels of most of the ‘hypoxia up’ genes (34 out of 54) and

5 of the 12 ‘hypoxia down’ genes were reversed by zinc
supplementation to cobalt treatment by more than 1.5 fold
change (Table 1).

(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, zinc treatment shifted the cobalt
sample to the untreated and zinc-treated samples (Fig. 1A,
see arrow) and the ADR+cobalt sample to the ADR and
ADR+zinc samples (Fig. 1A, see arrow), suggesting that
zinc counteracts and reverses the effect of cobalt on gene
expression. Indeed, this reversal effect was also evident
in heatmaps of the normalized expression data, showing
that most genes up-regulated by cobalt, marked by the red
sidebar, were down-regulated after zinc treatment, while
the group of genes down-regulated by cobalt, marked by
the green sidebar, was up-regulated after zinc treatment
(Figure 1B, compare C with ZC column). This expression
reversal was further analysed in the scatter plots showing
the same red and green groups of genes comparing cobalt
treatment with the untreated sample (Fig. 1C, left panel).
The right scatter plot in Fig. 1C shows the same groups
when comparing cobalt+zinc with the untreated sample.
In this comparison, almost all the genes are within the 1.5
fold change range (marked by dashed lines), meaning that
their expression levels were shifted towards their original
(untreated) values.
The strong effect of zinc on cobalt-induced gene
expression was evident in the samples treated with ADR.

Zinc supplementation reverses the gene expression
pattern induced by cobalt
We next compared global gene expression variation
between samples treated with different combination of
cobalt (C), zinc (Z) and ADR (A), as shown in Table 2.
The number of genes modulated by each treatment is
shown in Supplementary Table S1. We used Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), a method that reveals the
internal structure of high dimensional data in a way
which best explains the variance in the data [39]. PC1,
the first principal component, shows that ADR treatment
had the strongest effect on the cells (Fig. 1A), as PC1
separates the samples into two groups according to the
ADR effect, differentiating between samples treated
with ADR (red) and without ADR (blue). On the other
hand, PC2 separates the cobalt and ADR+cobalt samples
(filled red and blue squares) from the rest of the samples

The heatmap shows that cobalt treatment inhibited the
effect of ADR on gene expression (Fig. 2A, compare
column A with AC). Interestingly, zinc treatment
counteracted the effect of cobalt (Fig. 2A, compare
column AC with AZC), restoring the ADR-induced gene
expression (Fig. 2A, compare column AZC with A).
Of note, zinc treatment per se did not change the ADR-

induced gene expression (Fig. 2A, compare column A
with AZ), suggesting that the main variation obtained
was by cobalt treatment. This expression reversal was
also apparent in the scatter plots showing the comparison
of AC with A (Fig. 2B, left panel), and then reversal of
expression changes in AZC compared with A (Fig. 2B,
right panel), showing that zinc supplementation to AC

antagonized the effect of cobalt and decreased expression
of the up-regulated genes towards their expression levels
in A cells. The same applies to the down regulated genes.
Altogether, these findings demonstrate that most of the
genes that were significantly modulated by cobalt, when
compared with the untreated cells, were reversed by zinc
almost to their previous expression.

(AC) but restored by zinc (AZC) (Fig. 3C). As expected,
the apoptotic genes were neither up-regulated by zinc nor
in zinc-cobalt treatment (Fig. 3C, ZC).

Zinc restores the ADR-induced pro-apoptotic
pathway in the presence of cobalt

In addition to the apoptosis pathway, Table 3 reflects
the effect of ADR on chromatin and the clusters that
contain these genes showed enrichment for genes involved
in chromatin structure like histones, some of them
involved with enzymes of ribosomal RNA synthesis like
RNA polymerase I, and III. Many (over 50) of the genes
in this group are involved in facilitating transcription of
coding RNA by RNA polymerase II. In addition, genes
in these clusters take part in different signaling pathways
such as insulin receptor, PI3K, TP53, TGFB that are
also related to colorectal cancer. The pathways enriched
within the light blue and pink clusters (Fig. 3B) reflect the
effect of zinc on cobalt treatment and are mainly involved
in carbohydrates metabolism, in protein synthesis and
in regulation of metallothioneins (Table 4). Protein
translation is one of the processes down-regulated in
hypoxia [40]. In this regard, we found increased activation
by zinc of pathways, such as metabolism of amino acid,
aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis and transporters of amino
acids that will result in increase of protein synthesis
(Table 4). On the other hand, the genes that were downregulated by zinc are enriched in pathways of protein
degradation and in proteolytic enzymes associated with
protein degradation (Table 4). Decrease in the expression
of these genes results in decrease of protein degradation
in the cells, which complements the increase in protein
synthesis.

Enrichment analyses of the cluster genes showing
additional modified pathways

The next step in our analysis was the identification
of the cellular pathways that are enriched within groups
of modulated genes by the different treatments (see
Methods). We first analysed the set of genes modulated in
the comparison of AZC with AC treatments (denoted by
AZC-AC in Supplementary Table S1). The result is shown
in the Venn diagrams and includes 956 up-regulated genes
(Fig. 3A, left panel, pink) and 784 down regulated genes
(Fig. 3A, right panel, green). Most likely, the genes of
these groups, which intersected with genes modulated in
the A-0 comparison but not with ZC-C comparison, are
good candidates to include genes for apoptotic response.
Another group of genes that are modulated by zinc either
in the presence or in the absence of ADR, is represented
by the intersection of AZC-AC with ZC-C, and may not
contribute to the chemosensitivity of the cells, since cells
treated with zinc+cobalt do not undergo apoptosis [17].
This intersection includes 246 up-regulated genes (Fig.
3A, left panel, light blue) and 198 down-regulated genes
(Fig. 3A, right panel, violet). The normalized expression
levels of the genes that belong to these two groups are
shown in the heatmap using the same colors than the Venn
diagram, indicated on the side bar (Fig. 3B). The first two
clusters of genes (light blue, violet) showed differential
expression when comparing their expression in the cobalt
treated samples (AC, C) versus the other samples. The
third and fourth clusters (pink, green) showed differential
expression when comparing the ADR related samples (A,
AZ, AZC) with the rest of the samples. The reversal by
zinc supplementation to cobalt treated cells in the pink
and green clusters occurred only in the presence of ADR
(Fig. 3B, AZC vs. AC). In order to determine putatively
affected pathways, enrichment analysis was performed on
these clusters (see Methods). The first enrichment analysis
was performed on genes belonging to the pink and green
clusters (Fig. 3A, 3B). We found that the apoptotic
pathway showed one of the highest score for enrichment,
comprising 18 genes between up-regulated pro-apoptotic
genes (i.e., caspase 7 and 10, cytochrome C (CYCS) and
the apoptotic protease-activating factor APAF1, etc) and
down-regulated anti-apoptotic genes (i.e., inhibitor of
cell death BCL2L1, etc.) (Table 3). The heatmaps of the
normalized expression data show that the apoptotic genes,
up-regulated by ADR (A), were downregulated by cobalt

DISCUSSION
Hypoxia is a common state within many growing
tumors because of lack of adequate blood supply, that
promotes cell survival and blocks cell death. Therefore,
targeting hypoxia is an attractive strategy to inhibit tumor
growth and reactivate drug response. In the present
work we aimed at evaluating the global gene expression
pattern of colon cancer cell line, treated with the hypoxiamimetic cobalt and the antagonistic effect of zinc on the
gene expression level and particularly with regard to
response to drug (ADR) treatment. As demonstrated here,
zinc reverted almost completely the hypoxia-induced
gene expression. This was markedly evident by using
the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [39], a method
that reveals the internal structure of high dimensional
data in a way which best explains the variance in the
data. This method, clearly substantiated how the zinc
treatment shifted the cobalt samples near the untreated
or zinc-treated samples (see Fig. 1A, 1B). The positive
1198

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 1191 - 1202

effect of cobalt inhibition was then corroborated with drug
treatment (see Fig. 1A, Fig. 2).
How could zinc down-regulate the hypoxia-induced
gene expression? One mechanism could be through
inhibition of HIF-1 activity that mediates adaptive
responses to changes in tissue oxygenation. Thus, our
previous findings showed that zinc supplementation
to cancer cells downregulates HIF1α/2α protein levels
with a mechanism that involves PHD and VHL, leading
to inhibition of HIF-1 activity [9]. This was particularly
interesting in vivo, where the zinc-inhibitory of HIF-1a
was reached inside the xenograft tumor injected in nude
mice, meaning that oral zinc administration is able to
reach the tumor site and modify the intratumoral HIF-1a
expression [9]. The specific effect of zinc on HIF-1 activity
was evident here at the molecular level, where the list of
genes up-regulated by cobalt treatment and then reversed
to their initial expression values by zinc supplementation
(see Table 2), largely reflects the HIF-1 target genes (i.e.,
SLC2A1, BNIP3L, CA9, HK2, ALDOC, TMEM45A,
WSB1, etc.) [6, 35]. A large overlap with hypoxia related
genes compiled by MSigDB database [19] on the basis
of ten different studies [20-29] supported the hypoxia-like
effect of cobalt.
Is it possible to clinically exploit the zinc-induced
HIF-1 inhibition in tumor treatments? It is well known
that hypoxia leads to chemoresistance which is a
significant obstacle to successful cancer treatment [6].
One of the mechanisms of apoptosis resistance could be
through expression of GLUT-1 or glycolytic enzymes,
e.g., Aldolase A/C and hexokinases [41-43]. Besides these
protective mechanisms that depend on glucose metabolism,
alternative survival mechanisms that block apoptosis
under hypoxia have been also implicated. These survival
pathways may involve overexpression of anti-apoptotic
proteins, e.g., Bcl-2 and inhibition or downregulation of
pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bid or Bax [43]. Here, we
found that zinc supplementation markedly reversed both
the glycolytic pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways
(see Table 1), leading to restoration of chemosensitivity
under hypoxia. Thus, the ADR-induced gene expression,
partially abrogated by the cobalt treatment, was restored
by zinc supplementation almost to the original expression
level of ADR (see Fig. 1A, Fig. 2), therefore giving a
molecular answer to the initial question.
Recently, HIF-1 has been shown to antagonize
the p53 apoptotic activity [44] and in particular we
showed that this depends on HIF-1-induced HIPK2
downregulation [45]. A major determinant of a successful
cancer therapy is the ability of cancer cells to activate
apoptotic cell death, mainly through intact p53 function,
and much experimental and pre-clinical effort is devoted
to reactivation of inactive and/or mutant p53. Therefore,
by assuming that a solid tumor presents intratumoral
hypoxia, the zinc-induced HIF-1 inhibition should
rescue the p53 function in tumors bearing wtp53 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HIPK2. As a proof of principle, we found here that one
of the ubiquitine ligases involved in HIPK2 degradation
under hypoxia, that is WSB-1 [35, 36], was up-regulated
by cobalt but downregulated by zinc supplementation,
strongly supporting the role of zinc in reactivating the
HIPK2/p53 oncosuppressor axis under hypoxia. Another
molecule important in p53 regulation is the MDM2
oncogene that downregulates both p53 and HIPK2 protein
levels, strongly impairing tumor treatments [46]. Here, we
found that MDM2 was one of the genes that were downregulated by zinc (Table 4), supporting, at molecular level,
the zinc inhibitory effect on MDM2 activity [17, 47].
Although much more effort must be taken to
understand the physiological implications of the various
pathways modified by hypoxia and/or cobalt and after
zinc supplementation, our findings provide the molecular
basis for the reversal of the hypoxia-induced changes of
gene expression by zinc, which may have an effective
anticancer outcome through a more efficient utilization of
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and treatments
RKO human colon carcinoma cells (wild-type
p53) were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Life TechnologyInvitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum plus glutamine and antibiotics in humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 370 C. Subconfluent cells
were seeded the day before the treatment. The cells were
pre-treated for 16 hours with CoCl2 (200µM) and ZnCl2
(100 µM) before adding adryamicin (ADR) (1.5 µM) for
additional 8 hours. The list of the different combination
treatments used for the analyses is shown in Table 2, each
treatment was prepared in duplicates.

RNA extraction and reverse transcription (RT)PCR analysis
After treatments, cells were harvested in TRIzol
Reagent (Invitrogen) and total RNA was isolated
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The first
strand cDNA and the semi-quantitative RT-PCRs were
carried out essentially as described [17, 18]. Part of the
cDNA was used to validate the system through analyses
of gene transcription by RT-PCR by using genes specific
oligonucleotides under conditions of linear amplification
(data not shown). Total RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix
HU-gene st1.0 microarrays.

targeted for VHL-mediated destruction by prolyl
hydroxylation: implications for O2 sensing. Science. 2001;
292:464-468.

For normalization of the data from the 28,830
probesets of the arrays, Iter-Plier [48] algorithm was used
on the .cel files, followed by modified Lowess correction
algorithm [49] and log2 transformation. The mean
intensity of each probe set in each pair of replicates was
calculated, producing ‘averaged data’ for nine different
conditions. The histograms of these nine conditions are
plotted in Supplementary Figure S1. Intensity dependent
variance was estimated for each probe set, using the
distribution of the differences between repeats of probe
sets having similar mean intensity [50]. To look for
differentially expressed probe sets between the different
conditions, 17 comparisons were made (described in
Supplementary Table S1), Each comparison was made
between two corresponding pairs of replicates, using a
filtering step which included probe sets that were above
threshold (t=4) in both replicates, in at least one of the
conditions. FDR of 5% was applied on all probe sets to
control the number of false positives. An additional filter
was imposed, requiring the fold change of the average
gene expression to exceed 1.5. Unique gene representation
of the data (known gene symbols only) was calculated for
each gene symbol by averaging over all probe sets of that
gene, and by averaging the replicates of each treatment.
To extract some biological meaning from
differentially expressed genes, we looked at gene sets
that share a common biological function such as cellular
pathways. In order to do this we intersected the list of
co-expressed genes with a subset of gene sets from the
MsigDB [19] dataset, that belong to the positional,
canonical pathways and GO biological process collections,
retaining gene sets of minimal size of 8 and maximal size
of 500 genes. Each gene set was assigned an enrichment
score using the hyper geometric test; sets that passed FDR
of 10% and included at least 5 genes were considered as
significantly enriched.
