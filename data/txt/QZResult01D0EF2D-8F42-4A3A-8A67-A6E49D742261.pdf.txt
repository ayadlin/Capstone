ABSTRACT
Mesoderm Inducer in Xenopus Like1 (MIXL1), a paired-type homeobox
transcription factor induced by TGF-β family of ligands is required for early embryonic
specification of mesoderm and endoderm. Retrovirally transduced Mixl1 is reported
to induce acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with a high penetrance. But the
mechanistic underpinnings of MIXL1 mediated leukemogenesis are unknown. Here,
we establish the protooncogene c-REL to be a transcriptional target of MIXL1 by
genome wide chromatin immune precipitation. Accordingly, expression of c-REL and
its downstream targets BCL2L1 and BCL2A2 are elevated in MIXL1 expressing cells.
Notably, MIXL1 regulates c-REL through a zinc finger binding motif, potentially by a
MIXL1–Zinc finger protein transcriptional complex. Furthermore, MIXL1 expression
is detected in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) AML samples in a pattern mutually
exclusive from that of HOXA9, CDX2 and HLX suggesting the existence of a core, yet
distinct HOX transcriptional program. Finally, we demonstrate MIXL1 to be induced
by BMP4 and not TGF-β in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.
Consequently, MIXL1 expressing AML cells are preferentially sensitive to the BMPR1
kinase inhibitor LDN-193189. These findings support the existence of a novel MIXL1-c
REL mediated survival axis in AML that can be targeted by BMPR1 inhibitors. (MIXL1human gene, Mixl1- mouse ortholog, MIXL1- protein)

despite the incremental progress in defining subsets
responsive to aggressive chemotherapy [2]. Recent highthroughput genome sequencing efforts have identified
several somatic mutations some recurrent and some
unique to individual leukemia, uncovering the vast

genetic heterogeneity in AML [3–9]. Even as valuable
clues emerge from the mutational landscape, challenges
remain in discerning therapeutic vulnerabilities. Better
understanding of differentially expressed regulatory
genes may yield clues on novel target identification. In
this regard, homeobox genes (HOX), are constitutively
expressed in AML in contrast to the temporal regulation in
normal hematopoiesis [10–16]. But HOX proteins remain
unexplored as therapeutic targets due to the technical
limitations in inhibiting transcription factors.
MIXL1 the human ortholog of Mix.1, a pairedtype, non-clustered HOX transcription factor originally
isolated in Xenopus laevis is aberrantly expressed in
AML and lymphomas [17, 18]. In normal homeostasis,
MIXL1 expression is restricted to hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) [17]. Retroviral transduction
of Mixl1 the mouse ortholog, results in transplantable
AML in 100% of mice, suggesting a leukemogenic
potential for Mixl1 [19]. Additionally, forced expression
of Mixl1 in hematopoietic stem cells confers abnormal,
growth factor–dependent self-renewal potential to
granulocytic precursors [20]. Over expression of Mixl1
in mouse embryonic stem cells promotes mesodermal,
hemangioblastic, and hematopoietic progenitors
consistent with a role for mesoderm induction [21].
Mix.1 and orthologs of Mix.1 are induced by TGF-β/
BMP family of structurally related secreted molecules
[22–24]. In mammals, the TGF-β/BMP family
comprises of 24 ligands. The transmemebrane
receptor complex consists of two molecules each
of type II and type I receptor. Upon ligand binding,
type II receptor phosphorylates type I receptor which
in turn phosphorylates SMAD transcription factors.
Phosphorylated SMADs regulate target gene expression
in the nucleus to elicit a growth or differentiation
response. Given the functional overlap and redundancy
between the ligands [25], it is likely that Mixl1 may
be induced by different ligands in a cell type specific
manner. Thus in mouse ES cells TGF-β stimulation
results in SMAD 2 and 3 binding to Mixl1 promoter
[26]. In hematopoiesis, TGF-β confers quiescence to
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) raising the possibility
that MIXL1 may not be TGF-β inducible in HSCs [27].
The present study was aimed at determining factors
upstream and downstream of MIXL1 in hematopoiesis
and the potential role of MIXL1 in AML pathogenesis.
We identified several transcriptional targets of MIXL1
in myeloid leukemic lines using genome wide chromatin
immunoprecipitation. We establish the proto-oncogene
c-REL to be an important MIXL1 transcriptional target that
confers an anti apoptotic advantage to MIXL1 expressing
cells. Upstream of MIXL1, BMP4 induces MIXL1 in
HSPCs. Consistent with the BMP mediated induction, AML
cells that express MIXL1 are preferentially sensitive to type
1 BMP/activin receptor kinase inhibition. Together, these

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

results indicate for the first time a novel survival mechanism
conferred by BMP-MIXL1- c-REL axis in AML which can
be targeted by type I BMP receptor kinase inhibitors.

RESULTS
Generation of MIXL1-expressing AML cell lines
MIXL1 expression is varied in AML cell lines.
KG1, ML3, and K562 express abundant MIXL1,
whereas HL60 and U937 do not [17]. The lack
of MIXL1 expression in U937 cells allowed us to
generate isogenic cell lines with MIXL1 expression
as ectopic expression of transcription factors in these
cells has been valuable in elucidation of target genes
and pathways for SET-CAN, MLL, MN1 [28–30]
Therefore, we established two clonal lines (1MIXL1 and
2MIXL1) expressing HA- FLAG epitope tagged MIXL1
and a control vector–transduced clone in U937 cells. As
shown in Figure 1A, MIXL1 expression levels in the
clonal lines were similar to endogenous MIXL1 levels
in K562, KG1, ML3, and OCI-AML2 cells. There were
no significant differences in doubling time as measured
by conventional MTS assay or clonogenicity in methyl
cellulose between the control cells and the 1MIXL1 and
2MIXL1 cells However, response to the alkylating agent
doxorubicin differed significantly between the control
and MIXL1 expressing cells (Fig. 1B). After 24 hours of
treatment, doxorubicin had an LD50 of 0.25 μM for the
control line and 0.75 μM for 1MIXL and 2MIXL. At
1.75 μM, doxorubicin was cytotoxic to 100% of control
cells, whereas 30% of the MIXL1-expressing clones appear
to survive. These results suggested that MIXL1 expression
confers a survival advantage, potentially through an anti
apototic pathway. Importantly, such a subtle yet functional
response supported the use of these clonal lines for further
characterization of downstream transcriptional targets.

c-REL, a direct transcriptional target of MIXL1
By taking advantage of the Flag epitope tag and the
characterization of two distinct isogenic lines (1MIXL
and 2MIXL), we performed a rigorous, high-throughput
chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled sequencing
(ChIP-Seq) analysis. MIXL1–bound DNA fragments were
immunoprecipitated from each clonal line using monoclonal
antibodies against Flag epitope. For controls, two separate
immunoprecipitations were performed in the U937 vector–
transduced cells using (i) FLAG antibodies and (ii) mouse
immunoglobulin G (IgG). The sequenced DNA fragments
were aligned to the human genome and analyzed in different
combinations: 1MIXL-Flag normalized to control-Flag and
control-IgG, 2MIXL-Flag normalized to control-Flag and
control-IgG, and 1MIXL-Flag and 2MIXL-Flag combined
and then normalized to control-Flag and control-IgG.

peaks (denoted as “distant” in Fig. 2B) were classified as

the global ChIP results, we tested five of the target loci

MIXL1 binding loci were functionally annotated
using the gene ontology and tissue expression analyses
with the software DAVID (The Database for Annotation,
Visualization and Integrated Discovery version 6.7)
[31–33]. As anticipated for a homeobox transcription
factor MIXL1 occupied genes were involved in broad
categories of cellular processes, translation factor
activity, nucleic acid binding, organelle, cell part, cell
and organelle part functions (Table I and Supp. Table S2).
The most significant was the cellular processes class
(P value = 9.59E-04). Of note, was a tenfold enrichment
for factors regulating translation including EIF1
(NM_005801) confirmed by direct examination (Fig. 2C).
Based on the structure of homeodomain MIXL1 was
predicted to bind a 11 bp motif cooperatively as a dimer [34,
35]. Consistent with this prediction, TAAT motif with a 3 bp
spacer i.e TAATTARATTA, was identified by in vitro size
selection and confirmed to regulate expression of Gsc [36].
Likewise, Flk1, and Pdgfrα were identified to be activated
by a similar motif in mouse embryonic stem cells [37]. To
determine whether this motif was enriched in the set of 179
peaks (Supp. Table S1), we analyzed two variants of the
motif and a comparable randomized sequence using the
Motif Alignment and Search Tool (MAST) (Supp. Fig. S1).
Surprisingly, neither motif was more frequent in the 179peak set than the random sequence. We next performed
Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation
(MEME) [38] for the sequences within 200 bp of each peak
summit. As shown in Fig. 2D, the two highest peaks were:
NC(A/G)(C/G)(C/T/A)AG(G/A)(G/T/A)(G/A)
(G/T)(C/A)(G/A)(C/G)(C/T) (width = 15 nucleotides,
sites = 65, E-value = 1.1−027) and (G/A/T)(A/G/C)(G/A)
(G/C/A)(A/C/G)(G/A/T)(G/A)(A/G)(A/G)(G/A/C)
N(G/A)(G/A/C)(A/G/T)(G/A) (width = 15 nucleotides,
sites = 112, E-value = 3.6−015). Interestingly, both these
sites harbored a potential zinc finger binding motif
consensus. Thus, in the U937 myelomonocytic leukemia
system, MIXL1 appears to regulate transcription through
either a novel motif or interaction with another DNAbinding protein.
To further characterize direct transcriptional targets
of MIXL1, we performed whole-genome expression

analysis using the control and 1MIXL lines on an
Affymetrix HG-133 Plus 2.0 microarray (Supp. Table
S3). A few differentially expressed genes (APBB2,
EGR1, IL18R1, PCGF2, and c-REL) were validated by
reverse transcription coupled quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) to confirm the global expression
profiling results (Fig. 3A). When the ChIP-Seq results
were integrated with the global expression profiling
results, 82 of the 179 genes identified by ChIP-Seq were
either up regulated or down regulated. Sixty-seven of
these 82 MIXL1-binding genes were in gene promoters,
four were upstream of transcription start sites, nine were
in the gene body, and two were downstream of the 3′
transcription end (Supp. Table S4 and S5). Among the
genes with expression alterations, the proto-oncogene
c-REL, cellular homolog of the chicken retroviral
oncogene v-rel (for reticuloendotheliosis) and a member
of the NF-κB family, was of particular interest because
of its established role in inducing anti apoptotic genes
and the observed decrease in drug sensitivity in MIXL1
expressing clones shown in Fig. 1B  [39]. To confirm that
endogenous MIXL1 regulated c-REL expression, the AML
cell line KG1 was tested for occupancy with antibodies
against different epitopes (amino and carboxy terminals)
on the MIXL1 protein. Fig. 3B confirms localization of
MIXL1 to endogenous c-REL promoter in KG1 cells.
Next, we evaluated the expression of c-REL and its
transcriptional targets BCL2A1 and BCL2L1 (Fig. 3C).
As anticipated, KG1 cells expressed c-REL, BCL2A1 and
BCL2L1 transcripts. To determine whether genetic ablation
of MIXL1 affected the expression of its downstream
targets, we used two distinct short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
lentiviral vectors. MIXL1 expression was decreased under
the knockdown conditions with the two shRNAs but not
with the scrambled control (Fig. 3C). Expression of c-REL,
BCL2A1, and BCL2L1 were all lower under conditions of
MIXL1 knockdown. Forced expression of c-REL in MIXL1
shRNA–expressing cells rescued BCL2A1 and BCL2L1
expression, confirming these genes to be transcriptional
targets of c-REL. We next examined how genetic ablation
of endogenous MIXL1 affected the growth kinetics of KG1
cells (Fig. 3D). While the control shRNA–transfected cells

show enhanced transcript levels for c-REL, BCL2A1, and BCL2L1. Quantitative RT-PCR results show the differences in c-REL,
BCL2A1, and BCL2L1 expression levels between the U937 control, 1MIXL, and 2MIXL cells. Expression was normalized to 18S
rRNA transcript levels. Error bars represent standard deviation between triplicates. *p < 0.05. (B) ChIP localizes endogenous MIXL1

to c-REL promoter in KG1 cells. Quantitative genomic PCR analysis shows specific enrichment of endogenous MIXL1 immunoprecipitated
with either N-terminal or C-terminal MIXL1 antibodies on the c-REL promoter whereas an internal locus within the c-REL gene showed no
MIXL1 occupancy. Error bars represent standard deviation between triplicates. (C) Knockdown of MIXL1 decreased while enforced expression
of c-REL increased c-REL, BCL2A1, and BCL2L1 transcript levels. MIXL1 shRNA lentivirus and c-REL retrovirus were transduced into KG1
cells. RT-qPCR was performed in triplicate on RNAs isolated 48 hours after transduction. Expression was normalized to 18S rRNA levels, and
error bars represent standard deviation between triplicates. (D) c-REL over-expression rescues MIXL1 knockdown–mediated growth arrest in
KG1 cells. Growth was measured by MTS assay every 24 hours over a 4-day period in KG1 cells transduced with MIXL1 shRNA lentivirus and
c-REL retrovirus. Absorbance was normalized to that of a non-transfected control sample. *p < 0.05.

grew exponentially over 4 days as anticipated, the cells
with MIXL1 knockdown showed a diminished doubling
time for the first 48 hours. Enforced expression of c-REL
rescued the retarded growth establishing that loss of
c-REL expression in the absence of MIXL1 mediated the
diminished growth rate. These results demonstrate c-REL
to be a direct transcriptional target of MIXL1 in AML cells.
To further define the promoter elements ChIP
peak in the c-REL promoter was examined by luciferase
reporter assays with nested fragments (Fig. 4A). The
reporter constructs were co-transfected with a MIXL1
expression construct, a HOX-less MIXL1 expression
vector, or an empty vector in HEK293T cells and assayed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for luciferase activity. Of these, only the 700-bp and
944-bp promoters were significantly induced by fulllength  MIXL1 (Fig.  4B). To narrow down the region
further, the 5′ part of the 700-bp region was reduced to
progressively shorter fragments (Fig. 4A). Among these,
only the 550-bp promoter segment was significantly
induced by full-length MIXL1 (Fig. 4B).
A search of the 550-bp region for known
transcription factor binding motifs identified two NF-κB
motifs, a RUNX1 motif, two Sp1 motifs, and four MZF1
motifs (Supp. Fig. S2). MZF1 is a zinc finger transcription
factor associated with the myeloid lineage [40]. As the
consensus motif identified in the global ChIP was a zinc

of MIXL1 transcripts (Fig. 5A). MIXL1 expression was
seen in a subset of M0, M1, M2, M4 and M7 samples
but excluded from M3 and M6. Furthermore, global
expression profiling in the 1MIXL1 clonal U937 cells
suggested a decrease in HOXA cluster transcripts upon
MIXL1 expression. Although HOXA9 may not be a
direct target of repression, because of the established role
of HOXA9 in AML [41, 42], we examined whether the
inverse relationship between HOXA9 and MIXL1 was also
seen in primary AML samples. The FAB based analyses
confirmed mutually exclusive expression of MIXL1 and
HOXA9 within each FAB subset (Fig. 5A). To further
refine the identity of MIXL1 expressing AML samples,
we accessed the RNA-Seq data through c-Bioportal [43]
which allowed the threshold to be set at a z-score >= 1
for expression. Thus we identified samples with greater
than one standard deviation above the mean expression
value. By this criterion, MIXL1 was upregulated in 11.8%
of cases and amplified and overexpressed in 1.2% of

finger binding motif, qPCR analysis was performed with
c-REL promoter and control intron primer sets in MZF1immunoprecipitated 1MIXL cells (Fig. 4C). The promoter
region was enriched approximately 2.5-fold in the MZF1immunoprecipitated fraction, whereas the intronic control
region was not. These findings are consistent with c-REL
promoter activation by MZF1 through direct or indirect
interaction with MIXL1 (Fig. 4D).

Mutually exclusive expression of MIXL1 and
HOXA9 in primary AML samples
Next we interrogated the significance of MIXL1
expression in primary human AML. To determine if
MIXL1 expression levels were restricted to specific
French American British (FAB) categories of AML,
the RNA seq data from TCGA samples were correlated
with the 8 FAB subsets. Within each FAB category, the
samples were ordered according to the expression levels

normalization. Luciferase activity of each combination was tested in triplicate after 48 hours. Error bars represent standard deviation

cases (Fig. 5B). HOXA9 was up regulated in 10.8% of
cases. Once again, very few samples had expression in
either gene suggesting a mutually exclusive expression
pattern. Furthermore, higher transcript levels of the three
HOX genes previously characterized to be important in
AML (non-clustered HOX genes CDX2 [10], HLX [12],
HOXA9) and MIXL1 were mutually exclusive with a
few exceptions (Fig. 5B). To rule out the apparent lack
of overlap was due to the low threshold used, we validated
this method by examining the transcript levels of PBX3,
MEIS1, HOXA9 encoding members of a multi protein
complex [44–46]. Concomitant over expression of all three
members in this AML dataset confirmed the applicability of
this method (Supp. Fig. S3A).

To determine whether MIXL1 expression was
associated with any of the commonly identified somatic
mutations the TCGA samples were queried for NPM1,
FLT3, DNMT3A, and TP53 mutations (Fig. 5C). The most
frequent of these alterations were TP53 mutations, seen
in eight (38%) of the cases with MIXL1 expression;
interestingly, the eight cases constituted 66% of the
12 AML cases with TP53 mutations in this dataset.
The  other recurrent mutations were less frequent. Four
cases had mutations in NPM1; DNMT3A, and IDH1
mutations appeared in three cases each; FLT3 and RUNX1
mutations appeared in two cases each; and a single case
had a JAK3 mutation. In total, 76% (16/21) of the cases
with high MIXL1 expression had common AML associated

in distinct FAB subsets. The RNA-seq data are publicly available from the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). 177 samples
of Acute Myeloid Leukemia classified by leukemia French American British morphology code (FAB) and a total of 20319 genes with
expression values in the RPKM format were included. The data were quantile normalized using the normalize Quantiles function from the
limma package. The expression levels of MIXL1 and HOXA9 of the 177 samples from 8 FAB categories were plotted in the heatmap using
the heatmap.2 function in the gplots package of R 3.1.1. Within each FAB category, the samples were ordered according to the expression
value of the MIXL1 gene. (B) MIXL1 upregulation identifies a non-overlapping AML subset from those expressing CDX2, HOXA9, or
HLX. TCGA AML patient dataset was queried for alterations in expression as determined by RNA-Seq across 166 AML cases through
the cBioPortal database. Each column represents a case of AML. MIXL1 is amplified or upregulated in 13% of the total AML cases. Note
the predominantly non-overlapping expression patterns of MIXL1, CDX2, HOXA9, and HLX. (C) Seventy-six percent (16/21) of MIXL1expressing cases in TCGA AML dataset harbored somatic mutations common in AML (NPM1, FLT3, DNMT3A, IDH1, RUNX1 JAK3, and
TP53). Each column represents a case. (D) Relapse-free survival of MIXL1-expressing cases is lower than that of non–MIXL1-expressing
cases. TCGA AML cases were separated into two groups: MIXL1-expressing (increase in expression or amplified) and non–MIXL1expressing. Relapse-free survival was then compared between the two groups using the Kaplan-Meier method.

potential off target effects specific to MIXL1 expressing
cells, we tested LDN-193189 response in the stably
transfected clonal U937 cells, 1MIXL1. There was no
significant difference in sensitivity to LDN-193189 over
1-3 uM range between control U937 and 1MIXL1 cells

mutations. To validate this approach we queried the
mutational profile of HOXA9 over expressing samples;
these were predominant in the NPM1 mutated cases
(Supp. Fig. S3B) consistent with pediatric AML studies
and murine models of NPM1 mutations [47, 48].
Finally, to determine whether MIXL1 expression
impacts outcome in AML, the relapse-free survival
rates were compared between samples with expressing
MIXL1 and those without readily detectable expression.
The cases expressing MIXL1 had notably shorter
relapse-free survival than those without high MIXL1
( p = 0.051; Fig. 5D). In contrast, samples with increased
expression of CDX2, HLX and HOXA9 did not attain
statistically significant event free survival by these criteria
(Supp. Fig. S4 A-C).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we identify c-REL as a direct
transcriptional target of MIXL1 and BMP4 as a ligand
upstream of MIXL1. These findings implicate the BMP4–
MIXL1–c-REL axis in AML pathogenesis. Notably, this
pathway may be therapeutically targeted with type I BMP
receptor kinase inhibitors.

BMP4 induces MIXL1 in HSPCs and MIXL1expressing AML cells are sensitive to the BMP
inhibitor LDN-193189
To determine whether there is a ligand preference
between BMP and TGF-β for MIXL1 induction human
cord blood–derived HSPCs from three donors were
short-term cultured in the presence of BMP4 or TGF-β.
Upon 2 hours of treatment with BMP4, MIXL1 transcript
levels were 1.8–2 times higher than control HSPCs,
whereas MIXL1 was not induced by TGF-β (Fig. 6A).
These results suggested that BMP4 is a preferred ligand
upstream of MIXL1 in HSPCs. Since the HSPCs used
are an enriched lineage-negative population composed
primarily of progenitors with rare (<10%) stem cells, the
response to BMP4 was likely in the progenitors. Notably,
the consistent induction of MIXL1 in three donor-derived
HSPC lines signified a fundamental difference between
the BMP4 and TGF-β responses in these cells.
MIXL1 induction by BMP4 raised the possibility that
AML cells that express MIXL1 have increased sensitivity
to BMP pathway inhibition. The ALK2/3/6 (ACVR1,
BMPR1A, and BMPR1B) inhibitor LDN-193189 shows
a preference for BMP and activin signaling over TGF-β
signaling [49]. Four of the previously characterized high
MIXL1–expressing cell lines (OCI-AML2, KG1, ML3,
and K562) and two cell lines lacking MIXL1 expression
(U937  and HL60) were grown in medium containing
3 μM LDN-193189 for 4 days. LDN-193189 was strongly
cytotoxic to all the MIXL1-expressing cell lines, whereas
HL60 and U937 cells recovered by day 4 after an initial
setback (Fig. 6B). Since the high dose of LDN-193189
could have had off-target effects  [50], we performed
a dose-response assessment in the 0–700 nM range
(Fig.  6C). Once again, the MIXL1-negative cell lines
U937 and HL60 were relatively unaffected, whereas the
200–700nM range was cytotoxic to MIXL1-expressing
cells. The differential sensitivity of these AML cell
lines to LDN-193189 together with the BMP4-induced
expression of MIXL1 suggests that inhibition of the BMP
receptor kinase may be an effective therapeutic approach

Transcriptional targets of MIXL1
Several novel transcriptional targets of MIXL1
were identified by ChIP-Seq and the importance of a
number of these molecules and relevant pathways will
be examined in the future. For this initial report, c-REL
was of immediate relevance because of its established
role in the activation of the anti-apoptotic gene
BCL2L1 encoding Bcl-XL protein [51]. Although the
NFκB pathway is canonical, recent evidence suggests
potential functional variations in the activity of c-REL
depending on its subunit composition [52]. Thus, c-REL
homodimers or heterodimers with NFκB2 or RELB
may have varied transcriptional responses [53]. Among
these BCL2L1 encoding the BCL-XL protein is critical as
silencing this pathway synergizes with hypomethylating
agents in AML [54]. Likewise, retroviral expression of
BCL2A1 a lesser characterized anti-apototic molecule,
enhances engraftment potential of hematopoietic stem
cells and subsequent transformation to transplantable
malignancies [55].
Although intriguing initially, recent studies suggest
the possibility of a potential MIXL1-Tbox-MZF1–
containing multiprotein complex. First, our unbiased target
motif search based on rigorous ChIP sequencing studies
identified potential zinc finger binding sites (Fig.  2D).
Second, MIXL1 and the T box factors T, Eomes, Tbx6, and
Tbx20 interact directly in embryonic stem cells to regulate
transcription [56]. Third, TBX20-MZF1 interaction
has been identified in a high-throughput mammalian
transcription factor interaction screen  [57]. Therefore,
our findings raise the possibility with a MIXL1/Tbox/
MZF1 multiprotein complex that mediates transcriptional
regulation of c-REL. Clearly, further studies are necessary
to identify T box factor that bridges MIXL1 and MZF1.
Thus, the absence of the consensus TAAT motifs in the
ChIP targets together with MZF1 localization to the c-REL

through c-REL. Whereas this is the only readily
detectable difference in U937 cells, in KG1 cells genetic
ablation of endogenous MIXL1 results in loss of viability
(Fig. 3D) which is rescued by c-REL. Such a significant
difference between the two AML cell lines could be
explained in part by the fundamental difference in the
driver mutations in these cell lines. U937 cells harbor a
CALM-AF10 translocation [62] whereas KG1 is driven
by a constitutively activated FGFR1 tyrosine kinase
due to FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 translocation [63]. CALMAF10 fusion induces HOXA over expression in murine
models [64]. Recent studies demonstrate CALM-AF10
mediated epigenetic reprogramming of HOXA locus
to be dependent on nuclear exporter CRM1. Thus the
transcriptional circuit in U937 cells is distinct from that
of KG1. Therefore, U937 cells may be addicted to other
HOX cluster mediated growth and clonogenic advantage
whereas KG1 cells may be dependent on MIXL1.

promoter (Fig. 4C) suggest that MIXL1-MZF1–containing
multiprotein complexes, rather than MIXL1 homodimers,
may be important in AML. Such a scenario would be
analogous to, the paired type homeo box factor NKX2-5,
TBX3, and zinc finger factor GATA4 multiprotein complex
that plays a central role in cardiac development [58].

MIXL1 as a novel marker in AML
MIXL1-expression makes up 13% of AMLs in the
TCGA dataset, a group both distinct from and larger
than the CDX2- and HOXA9-expressing subsets (Fig. 5A
and 5B). Using the cBioPortal RNA-Seq data, we set the
threshold low so that subtle yet pathologically relevant
alterations may be detected. This group had a slightly
lower rate of survival than those not expressing MIXL1
(Fig. 5D), suggesting that MIXL1 may be an independent
prognostic marker.
Our analysis of TCGA AML dataset although small,
agrees overall with the larger global profiling results for
HOX expression in AML: FLT3-mutated AMLs have
higher HOXA9 expression [59], AMLs with mutant NPM1
also show aberrant HOXA9 expression [47], and the
coordinate expression of three established members of a
transcriptional complex—HOXA9, MEIS1, and PBX3—is
common (Supp. Fig. 3A). Notably, the search for MIXL1
expression in TCGA AML cases uncovered an elegant
stratification of HOX expression, including some patterns
of mutual exclusion. The mutual exclusivity of MIXL1
and HOXA9 expression (Fig. 5A and 5B) suggests the
specific homeobox genes might cooperate with distinct
driver mutations. Lack of MIXL1 expression in AML
M3 acute promyelocytic leukemia (Fig. 5A), frequently
associated with the PML-RARA translocation arising in
the context of myeloid restricted gene expression program
is also consistent with such a model. Collectively, these
results suggest that quantitative evaluation of both
clustered and non-clustered HOX transcripts in AML may
stratify AML further. Such an evaluation may elucidate
whether HOX expression reflects the stage of progenitor
maturation which cooperates with the driver mutations.
Interestingly, a recent report in pediatric AML suggests
a similar pattern of mutual exclusion; namely HOXA
and HOXB down regulation in cases of RUNX1 or PML/
RARA translocation or CEBPA double mutations, HOXA
up regulation, HOXB down regulation in cases of MLL
translocation and MYST up regulation, or HOXA and
HOXB upregulation in patients with NPM1 mutation, and
NUP98 translocations. Thus the HOX expression pattern
could be segregated by distinct cytogenetic or driver
mutations [60, 61].
Functionally, the decreased drug sensitivity of
MIXL1 expressing U937 clones shown in Fig. 1A is
suggestive of an antiapoptotic advantage conferred

Therapeutic potential of targeting type 1 BMP
receptor
Mix.1 is induced in Xenopus embryos by BMP4 or
activin A in a SMAD5-dependent manner [22, 23], and
MIXL1 can be induced by TGF-β in human hepatocellular
carcinoma [65] and in mouse embryonic stem cells [26].
TGF-β from the glial cells within the bone marrow niche
is thought to maintain hematopoietic stem cell quiescence
[27]. BMP proteins regulate maintenance, proliferation,
and repopulating activities of hematopoietic progenitors
[66–68]. A recent study reported that BMP receptor
IB is required for the expansion of primitive chronic
myelogenous leukemia stem cells, raising the possibility
of targeting this pathway in chronic myelogenous
leukemia [69]. Additionally, a subset of pediatric AML
cases with a novel translocation CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and
poor outcomes express BMP2 constitutively and respond
in vitro to dorsomorphin, a precursor molecule to LDN193189. Importantly, these studies demonstrated murine
bone marrow cells transduced with CBFA2T3-GLIS2 to
be more sensitive to dorsomorphin than wild type cells
in colony forming assays [70]. Our findings demonstrate
for the first time that MIXL1 is induced in human HSPCs
by BMP4. Future studies will uncover whether the BMP
ligand for MIXL1 induction in HSPCs is stromally derived
or autocrine. Above all, our findings suggest the ACVR1/
BMPR1 pathway to be preferentially engaged to induce
MIXL1 in hematopoietic stem cells or progenitors. As
shown in Fig. 7A the canonical type II receptor dimer
phosphorylates the type I receptor upon ligand binding
[25]. The phosphorylated type I receptor in turn may
phosphorylate SMADs 1 or 5 which translocate to the
nucleus to activate MIXL1 expression. Our findings are
consistent with existence of such a pathway in MIXL1

expressing KG1, OCI-ML2 and K562 cells. Of note,
studies from the Zon laboratory showed BMP2 treatment
of K562 and U937 recruited phosphor SMAD1 with
lineage specific factors (erythroid factor GATA1 in K562
cells derived from chronic myelogenous leukemia in
erythroid blast crisis and CEBPA in U937 myelomonocytic
cells) [71]. A search of the ChIP seq data from this study
in the public domain revealed SMAD1 binding to MIXL1
promoter in K562 and not U937 cells. Thus a potential
model shown in Fig. 7B suggests expression of MIXL1
induced by BMP or related ligand can be inhibited by
LDN-193189 to induce cell death. Recent studies in
lung cancer cell lines demonstrate potent inhibition of
clonogenic potential of lung cancer cells by LDN-193189
in a SMAD dependent manner [72].
Of note, two thirds of TCGA AML samples with
TP53 mutations, a subset with very few therapeutic
options, had high MIXL1 expression. The significance
of MIXL1 expression is further heightened in the context
of BMP pathway suppression in the AML cell lines KG1
and K562, which have compromised TP53 activity. The
differential cytotoxicity by 3 μM LDN-193189 specific to
those lines indicate that a defined subtype of AML may
be responsive to type I BMP receptor kinase suppression.
LDN-193189 also inhibits non canonical BMP signaling
[73]. This would be a significant boon, as LDN-193189

has already been used in rodent models of hepcidininduced chronic anemia and fibrodysplasia ossificans
progressiva (FOP) with constitutive activation of ACVR1,
a type 1 BMP receptor kinase [49, 74]. A caveat, however,
is that LDN-193189 inhibits ALK2/3/6 kinases (ACVR1,
BMPR1A, and BMPR1B) [75], and its activity may inhibit
other type I receptors of the TGF family ligands. Other
kinases that LDN-193189 can bind and inhibit include
SIK1, ABL, VEGFR, YES1, CAMKK2 [76]. While
many of these kinases may be useful therapeutic targets
themselves, the role that inhibition of BMP or related
ligands would play in AML needs further evaluation.
Indeed, a soluble activin receptor that sequesters the ligand
is showing promise in myelodysplasia, a clonal disorder
and common precursor to AML [77, 78].
In summary, we define for the first time the potential
role of MIXL1 in human AML and implicate c-REL as
a direct transcriptional MIXL1 target to confer an anti
apoptotic advantage. More extensive studies are required
to define mutually exclusive expression of MIXL1 from
other HOXs, inducibility of MIXL1 by BMP4 and above
all preferential sensitivity of MIXL1 expressing AML cells
to BMPR1 inhibitors. The findings reported here provide
a compelling rationale for future investigations which
may lead to a novel targeted therapy for an aggressive subset
of AML.

Figure 7: BMP4 induced MIXL1 an important survival axis and therapeutic target in AML. (A) Canonical BMP signaling
pathway. Upon BMP binding to type II receptor (BMPRII), type I receptor BMPRI is phosphorylated. Activated BMPRI phosphorylates
SMAD1 or 5 which heterodimerizes with SMAD4 to up regulate MIXL1 expression. (B) BMPR1 mediated signal is hypothesized to induce
endogenous MIXL1 expression in KG1, OCI-ML2, ML3 and K562 cell lines. These cells are sensitive to BMPR1 inhibitor LDN-193189.
Enforced expression of MIXL1 in U937 cells 1MIXL1 is independent of BMP signaling and therefore insensitive to LDN-193189. In HL60
and U937 cells which are insensitive to LDN-193189, the pathway may be absent or modified.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

of 108 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde
in growth medium at 37°C for 20 minutes. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes
and resuspended in 500 μl of radio-immunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. After 10 minutes on ice, the
cells were sonicated 20 times at 4–5 watts for 20 seconds,
with a rest time of 40 seconds between each sonication.
The samples were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4°C
and precleared with 20 μl of A/G agarose slurry for 1 hour
at 4°C. Two aliquots from each lysate were processed
as follows: Flag-IP with 240 μl of the lysate, 250 μl of
lysis buffer, and 8.4 μg of mouse anti-flag antibody (antiFlag-M2; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and IgG-IP with
240 μl of the lysate, 250 μl of lysis buffer, and 8.4 μg of
mouse IgG. The samples were incubated overnight at 4°C
with rotation and then incubated for an additional hour
with 20 μl of A/G agarose slurry. The agarose beads were
recovered by centrifugation and washed for 15 minutes
each in RIPA lysis buffer, high-salt RIPA buffer, lithium
chloride RIPA buffer, and finally TE buffer prior to
proteinase K and RNAse treatment at 37°C overnight. The
samples were incubated for 6 hours at 65°C to reverse the
cross-linking. DNA was precipitated overnight at –20°C
in 75% ethanol and then washed twice in 75% ethanol.
For each sample, DNA from a 20-μl aliquot of the preimmunoprecipitation lysate diluted with 180 μl of TE
buffer served as another control for target amplification.
The DNAs were resuspended in 50 μl of ddH2O, and the
pre-immunoprecipitation sample was diluted with 450 μl
of ddH2O. Fifty nanograms each of immunoprecipitated
DNAs from (1) U937 control IgG-IP, (2) U937 control
Flag-IP, (3) U937 1MIXL Flag-IP, and (4) U937 2MIXL
Flag-IP were used to construct libraries at the Sequencing
and Microarray Facility at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center using the Beckman SPRIworks
system, Pasadena, CA. Illumina analysis pipeline
(GAPipeline-1.5.0 San Diego, CA) was used for base
calling and alignment to the human genome. Peak calling
was done by MACS v1.3.7.1 with p ≤ 1e-5 considered
significant. Peaks were identified against the human
genome (University of California, Santa Cruz, genome
browser assembly hg18, NCBI36) using genome modelbased analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) [84]. Unique peaks
were generated by normalizing to the two control samples
in three combinations: Flag-1MIXL to IgG-control and
Flag-control, Flag-2MIXL to IgG-control and Flagcontrol, and Flag-1MIXL and Flag-2MIXL combined to
IgG-control and Flag-control. The primary dataset used
for analysis comprised the overlapping peaks in all three
analyses. The combined dataset was tested for predicted
Paired-Q9 binding motifs [34, 35] using MAST [85], and
enriched motifs were identified using MEME [38].
ChIP-PCR confirmation was performed by SYBR
green system quantitative PCR using an exonic REL region
primer set as a control and the following primer sets: REL
internal region (5′-TTACCAGGATTTTGGCAAGG-3′

Cell culture
AML cell lines U937, HL60, OCI-AML2, and ML3
and chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 were grown
in 5% CO2, 95% humdified air at 37°C in RPMI 1640 with
10% fetal bovine serum. KG1 cells were grown in RPMI
1640 with 20% fetal bovine serum. Human embryonic cell
line HEK-293T was grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum.
We established two clonal lines, 1MIXL and
2MIXL, expressing amino FLAG- and HA-tagged MIXL1
driven by a Tet response element in the U937 clonal line
expressing the tetracycline-controlled transactivator
protein as previously described [28, 79, 80]. A clonal
line transfected with the vector served as a control. After
multiple passages, we noted that both lines were leaky
regardless of the selection pressure. Therefore, 1MIXL
and 2MIXL were treated as stable MIXL1 overexpression
clones without any selection agent or tetracycline.

Human cord blood hematopoietic stem
progenitors
Human CD34+ progenitor cells were acquired
from cord blood as described previously [81]. Briefly,
mononuclear cells were isolated from umbilical cord blood
by density gradient separation, followed by enrichment of
CD34+ cells via magnetic bead separation. CD34+ HSPCs
were cultured in TGF-β or BMP4 for 2 hours.

Lentiviral knockdown
Lentiviral constructs were from Open Biosystems
(Pittsburgh, PA) and designated as follows: MIXL1 KD1 =
TRCN0000019155, MIXL KD2 = TRCN0000019156, and
Rel Expression = ccsbBroad304_11094. The protocol for
lentiviral production was similar to that of Moffat et al. in
HEK293T cells by transient transfection of the lentiviral
construct, the envelope construct pCMV-VSV-G, and the
gag-pol construct at a ratio of 2:1:1, respectively [82].
Transductions of AML cells were performed by
resuspending 2 × 105 cells in 1 ml of virus-containing
medium with 8 μg/ml polybrene and incubating the
suspension at 37°C for 24 hours prior to pelleting by
centrifugation and resuspension in growth medium.
Growth assay and expression experiments were
performed 48 hours after transduction in medium
containing 2 μg/ml puromycin.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was based on
the procedure used by Chadee et al. [83] with the

was reverse transcribed and assayed.

Immunoblotting
The Western blotting technique was performed
as previously described [17] using the following
modifications: Samples lysed with whole cell lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton
X-100, 1 mM DTT 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin,
2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mM NaVO3, 1 mM PMSF), were
resolved on 10% NuPAGE gel (Life Technologies), and
a mixture of Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (50 mM
Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 adjusted to pH
7.6) was used for immunoblotting. The primary antibodies
used were anti-MIXL1-N at a dilution of 1:1,500 and
beta-actin (Sigma Aldrich) at 1:5,000. The secondary
antibodies used were anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase
(GE Healthcare Wauwatosa, WI at 1:10,000 and antimouse horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare) at 1:7,000
for the beta-actin primary antibody.

Global expression profiling
To identify potential targets of the MIXL1
transcription factor, we performed global expression
profiling analysis on MIXL1-expressing cells by
microarray. The 1MIXL and control cell lines were
cultured without Tet for 24 hours at 5 × 104 cells/ml. RNA
was extracted from 5 × 106 cells by RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Extracted RNA was hybridized
against a HG-U133A Microarray (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA).
For analysis, dChip analyzer software [86] was used,
normalizing the 1MIXL dataset to the control dataset, and
gene expression models were obtained through the Perfect
Model–only approach. Differentially expressed genes
were defined as genes in which the difference between the
detected expression levels was at least 100 and the ratio
was at least 1.2.

Luciferase assay
Luciferase constructs were generated by PCR
amplification of normal human DNA segments of the REL
peak region identified by ChIP-Seq. Promoter segments
were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the
following probes:
Rel-R-EcoR1
(5′-ctgtgaattcCGCAGTCAGTCAGTCAGGAG-3′),
Rel-FM-130
(5′-ctgtacgcgtAGAATTCAGGGGTTGGGAAG-3′),

Rel-RE-200
(5′-ctgtgaattcGGCTAGCAGCGTGAGAAGG-3′),
Rel-RE-300
(5′-ctgtgaattcGACGCAGCAACCCTCACC-3′), and
Rel-RE-580
(5′-ctgtgaattcAACCCCTGAATTCTTGCAC-3′). Each was
then sub-cloned into the pBV-Luc vector between the Mlu1
and EcoR1 sites. 293T cells were transfected with 200 ng
of expression vector, 200 ng of luciferase vector, and 0.2 ng
of Renilla luciferase vector by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY). The activity was then tested by the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System  (Promega,
Madison, WI) 48 hours post-transfection.

Public access
The ChIP Seq data can be accessed at GSE52781
and the expression profiling is designated GSE52622

RT-qPCR
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (QIAGEN), and cDNA was prepared by reverse
transcription using SuperScript II (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). The samples were assayed by qPCR in

(Hs00968440_m1), REL (Hs00231279_m1), BCL2L1
(Hs99999146_m1), BCL2A1 (Hs00187845_m1).
For CD34+ cells, RNA was harvested in triplicate
from approximately 2,500 cells using the RNeasy Plus
Micro Kit (QIAGEN) 2 hours after the addition of either
50 ng/ml BMP4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or
2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Sigma-Aldrich) in X-VIVO 15 medium

clinical data and expression data from the 166 samples
were collected from the TCGA AML dataset for whom
outcome was available [8] and compared between the
amplified or upregulated group and the normal, loss, or
down-regulated group for each gene. The unadjusted
distribution of relapse-free survival was evaluated by the
method of Kaplan and Meier [90], and the differences
in the distributions between expression levels were
compared using the log-rank test.
Transcription factor binding motifs in the c-REL
promoter were identified using TFSEARCH [91].

The MTS assay in which a tetrazolium compound
is reduced by cellular NADH to generate colorimtrically
detectable formazon product was used to quantify cell
number and viability. The amount of product formed
was a direct function of the number of viable cells. For
comparative analysis of the effects of doxorubicin on
U937 MIXL1-overexpressing lines, doxorubicin (SigmaAldrich) was added to the cell lines at 0–2 μM in triplicate,
for 24 hours of incubation before MTS treatment.
Comparison of knockdown cell lines was performed by
plating 3 × 104 cells/well for each line into a 96-well plate
in triplicate and then adding the CellTiter 96 AQueous
Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega)
with a 1-hour incubation, following the manufacturer’s
instructions. For LDN-193189 treatment, each cell line
was grown in growth medium containing either 3 μM
LDN-193189 (Cellagen Technology, San Diego, CA) or
vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) in triplicate for 4 days with
growth measured every 24 hours. For the dose-response
studies, each line was grown in 0–0.7 μM LDN-193189 in
triplicate replenished with fresh drug-containing medium
every 24 hours to account for loss of drug activity at 37°C,
and the MTS assay was performed at day 4.

The functionality of the gene list from CHIPseq, was analyzed for gene ontology analysis and tissue
expression with the software DAVID (The Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
version 6.7 [31–33]. The functional analysis in DAVID
evaluated gene-to-gene similarity by utilizing the terms
from gene ontology [87]
The RNA-seq data were publicly available from
the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
tcga/). 177 AML samples stratified by leukemia French
American British morphology classification (FAB) and
a total of 20319 genes with expression values in the
RPKM format were included. The data were quantile
normalized using the normalizeQuantiles function from
the limma package [88] The expression levels of MIXL1
and HOXA9 of the 177 samples from 8 FAB categories
were plotted in the heatmap using the heatmap.2 function
in the gplots package of R 3.1.1 (Development Core
Team  .  R Foundation for Statistical Computing.
Vienna, Austria: 2009. R: A language and environment
for statistical computing. ISBN 3-900051-07-0, URL
http://www.R-project.org). Within each FAB category,
the samples were ordered according to the expression
value of the MIXL1 gene. Additionally, TCGA AML
database [8] was accessed and analyzed through the
cBioPortal [43,  89] for cases with a mutation, copynumber alteration, or expression change over a threshold
of 1.0 in the genes of interest. For statistical analysis,
