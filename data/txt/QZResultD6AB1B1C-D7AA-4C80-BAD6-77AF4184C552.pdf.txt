ABSTRACT
Anticancer potential of metformin has been extensively studied. However, its
anticancer clinical use remains yet to be approved since sufficient concentration on
target organs could not be achieved via conventional administration. To overcome
this drawback, we aim to examine the efficiency of novel intravesical treatment
of metformin on syngeneic orthotopic preclinical model. Three human and one
murine bladder cancer cell lines were tested in vitro for inhibitory sensitivity by
MTT and cologenic assays. AMPK pathway including AKT, Erk and S6K was examined
by western blot and further explored by regulating activated levels using specific
inhibitors. In vivo efficacy was determined by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and
measurements of body and bladder weights plus tumor biomarkers. Lactic acid and
metformin levels of plasma were measured by standard procedures. The results
demonstrated that metformin activated AMPK and decreased phosphorylation of Akt
and Erk. Furthermore, combinations of metformin with either Akt or Erk inhibitors
synergistically diminished cancer proliferation, suggesting the involvement of Aktand Erk- related pathways. Intravesical metformin 26 and 104 mg/kg, twice per week
demonstrated a rapid elimination of the implanted tumor without any evidence of
toxicity. In contrast, oral treatment at a dose of 800mg/kg/d exhibited little efficacy
whereas severe toxicity existed if the dosage is higher. Collectively, intravesical
metformin displays potent inhibition on bladder cancer in vitro and this preclinical
study reveals the profound therapeutic application of metformin with durable
tolerance via intravesical administration route.

chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents [3–4].
However, these methods are largely restricted with various
degrees of side effects such as bone marrow suppression,
allergic reactions and etc[5]. Thus, there is an unmet
demand to discover safe and effective drugs for treating
bladder cancer.
Abnormality of metabolism is one typical
characteristic of tumors proposed in Warburg effect.
There is renewed interest in developing novel anti-cancer

INTRODUCTION
Bladder cancer is one of the most frequent cancers
of the urinary tract, accounting for about 74,000 new cases
and 16,000 deaths in the United States in 2015[1]. Even
though transurethral resection has served as the standard
treatment, recurrence and metastasis are often seen in
clinic [2]. The commonest way to prevent recurrence
and progression is supplemented with intravesical

breakthroughs modulating metabolism to limit neoplastic
growth. Tumorigenesis is a multistep process and tumor
cells often display alterations in their energy metabolism to
support rapid growth [6]. Metabolic reprogramming might
be a profound strategy for cancer treatment. Metformin,
a widely prescribed drug for treating type II diabetes,
is one of the most extensively recognized metabolism
modulators. Epidemiological evidence indicates that
metformin has a high potential efficacy as an anti-cancer
drug [7–10]. Data collected from various xenograft cancer
models suggest that metformin delays the progression and
relapse of cancer but no much research in bladder cancer
is available [11–12].
Moreover, over two hundreds of clinical trials on
anticancer studies have either been completed or are on
going. However, no positive clinical results have been
reported yet. Concentration of metformin on target organs
is probably the major obstacle for these unsatisfactory
results [13]. We notice that oral administration is the
general treatment route in these bench work studies and
clinical trials. The maximum concentration of metformin
in circulating system is less than 60 μM via oral
administration, far less away from 2 mM, the minimum
effective concentration in vitro [14]. Moreover, increase of
oral dosage of metformin causes the risk of lactic acidosis,
having a vicious circle with the lactic acidosis produced
by tumors via anaerobic glycolysis. Therefore, alternative
administration to achieve an effective dose is critical [13].
Thus, in this present study, we aim to explore the
efficacy of metformin using intravesical administration
to treat bladder cancer. To achieve this aim, MB49, the
popular murine bladder cancer cell line, was applied to
establish syngeneic orthotopic model. This study provides
an effective strategy to eradicate bladder cancer.

Metformin inhibits bladder cancer cell
proliferation
These cell lines were exposed to 0. 5~64 mM
metformin. Interestingly, metformin generally promoted
cell growth at less than 0.5mM concentration, then turned
to a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. The
most sensitive cell line is UMUC3 with IC50 8.25mM while
the most resistant one is J82 (IC5030.24mM ) (Figure 1,
Table 1).

Metformin suppresses colony formation
Colony formation was examined in the presence of
metformin with either regular continuous or intermittent
fashion. In regular continuous fashion, it was found
that 0.5mM metformin favored the colony formation as
shown in Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure S1. However,
suppressive effect increased when the concentration of
metformin was higher than 2mM in T24 and UMUC3 cell
lines. Inhibitory effect in J82 was not significant, showing
similar pattern observed in proliferation assay described
above.
To mimic intravesical treatment, we designed an
intermittent treatment protocol with 2 hour metformin
incubation twice per week for two weeks (Figure 2B,
Supplementary Figure S2). Understandably, much higher
concentration of metformin is needed for inhibiting the
colony formation, compared with that in continuous
fashion in general (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure
S2). MB49 and UMUC3 were more sensitive than T24,
same trend observed in continuous fashion. The dramatic

inhibitor of Erk1/2, or MK2206, the inhibitor of AKT
exerts synergistic inhibition of cancer cell growth with
metformin respectively, in a dose dependent fashion. This
indicated that both Erk1/2 and AKT pathways got involved
in events of inhibition of metformin. Interestingly, western
blot results demonstrate that MK2206 alone increases
protein level of phospho-AMPK while AZD6244 does
not, indicating that inhibition of Akt may exert a different
effect on phospho-AMPK, compared to inhibition of
Erk, which warrants further investigation (Figure 5B
and 5D). However, both MK2206 and AZD6244 amplify
metformin-induced phosphorylation of AMPK (Figure 5B
and 5D). Inhibition of either AKT or Erk1/2 will produce
synergistical effect with metformin but MK2206 and
AZD6244 may exert these effects via different molecular
ways which also warrant further investigation.

Metformin activates AMPK
AMPK, a central energy sensor, is known as a
crucial factor in the interaction between metabolism and
cancer [15]. As the activation of AMPK correlates tightly
with phosphorylation at Thr-172 (p-AMPKα), we assessed
activation of AMPK by determining phosphorylation
AMPKα and its primary downstream targeting enzyme
such as p-p70s6k, p-4EBP1 and p-ACC. As shown in
Figure 3A–3C, metformin activated AMPK markedly
and decreased the phosphorylation of downstream
proteins including 4EBP1 and P70S6K. In the meantime,
metformin increases the protein level of p-ACC then
inhibits FASN, its downstream of AMPK-ACC, consistent
with previous reports [16–17].
Next, we added AMPK specific inhibitor compound
C to determine whether activating AMPK signaling
pathway is essential for metformin to exert anti-tumor
effect. As shown in Figure 3D, the ability of metformin to
inhibit MB49 cancer cell proliferation was reduced after
adding compound C, implying that inhibition of AMPK
accelerates proliferation of cancer cells, consistent with
western blot results (Figure 3E). Similar trends of human
bladder cancer cells T24 and UMUC3 were observed
(Supplementary Figures S3 & S4).

Intravesical rather than oral administration of
metformin exert potent anti-cancer effects on
orthotopic bladder tumors
Orthotopic mouse model was established to provide
the useful tool to determine the effect of intravesical
localized treatment [23]. Syngeinic tumor implantation
provided better tumor take rate compared to the xenograft
implantation [24].
Further, experimental trials on cancer cell
implantation were conducted with harder but safe
scratching on bladder wall to guarantee 100% tumor take
rate. After achieving this rate, we designed intravesical
and oral administrations, comparing efficacy and toxicity
between the two different routes.
In total, five groups were designed, 2 control groups:
I-control with tumor and V- control without tumor, and
3 treatment groups: II- oral-treated group (800mg/kg/d),
III- intravesical treated group (80mM, 50μL, equivalent
to 26 mg/kg, twice per week) ,and IV- intravesical treated
group (320mM, 50μL, equivalent to 104 mg/kg, twice
per week). All treatments started at day 2 post tumor
implantation for two weeks. Orthotopic bladder cancer
implantation was processed for mice in Groups I, II, III,
and IV except Group V, control mice without treatment
in the absence of tumor. Figure 6A shows cumulative
survival curves of five groups. Cancer cell implantation
induced death of mice (Group I) but intravesical treatment
dramatically enhanced life span with better survival in
higher dose (Group IV vs Group I, p<0.001). Identical
cumulative survival curves were observed in Groups IV
and V, suggesting a potent anticancer efficiency of high
dose of intravesical metformin. Oral treatment exerts very
mild benefit in improving survival (Group II vs Group I,
p = 0.015). Furthermore, there is a close correlation
between the decrease of mouse body weight and the
progression of tumor, based on observations of tumor
implantation trials (data not shown). Therefore, decrease
of mouse body weight could be a surrogate for tumor

Both AKT and ERK signaling pathways
participate in inhibitory effect of metformin on
bladder cancer cell growth
Phosphorylated AKT and ERK are key intracellular
mediators of cell survival and proliferation signals. Recent
findings have confirmed that activated mutation of PI3k
is associated with improved recurrence-free survival
[18–20]. Thus, inhibition of Akt, the downstream of PI3K
pathway, would be beneficial to block cancer cell growth
[21–22]. Examining these molecular pathways during
metformin treatment is meaningful for us to elaborate
its anticancer mechanism. As shown in Figure 4A–4C,
metformin decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and/or
Erk1/2 at higher than 0.5 mM with no significant change
on the protein levels of total Erk1/2 and AKT, in MB49,
T24 and UMUC3, indicating that the inhibitory effect of
metformin is correlated to the PI3K and Erk signaling
pathways. A slight increase of phosphorylation of Erk1/2
at 0.5 mM in MB49 and UMUC3 cells is associated
with the results of increase of colony formation at this
concentration in Figure 2A. There was no significant
difference of these signaling pathways among these
cell lines. These data prompted us to further probe the
role of Erk1/2 and AKT pathway by these inhibitors.

progression. As shown in Figure 6B, the decrease of body
weight in Group I is seen, indicating the toxicity induced
by tumor implantation. This decrease in body weight
is attenuated by oral metformin at dose of 800mg/kg/d
(Group II). However, oral administration is not able to
reverse this decrease. In contrast, intravesical treatments
at both doses reverse this decrease with better efficiency
at higher dose (320mM). Furthermore, at the end of
experiment, the weight of bladders was examined. The
weight of every bladder in Group I was much bigger
than that in Group V, indicating 100% existence of
tumors in all mice in Group I (Figure 6C). Intravesical
treatment profoundly diminished bladder weights at both
doses. The bladder weights with higher dose are almost
back to normal (Group IV vs Group V, p = 0.081). Oral
administration reduced the bladder weights as well but
this reduction was the mildest (132.8 mg vs 80.1 mg,
Figure 6C). Furthermore, H&E results show the complete
absence of tumor in Group IV (Figure 6D). In contrast,
oral administration (Group II) causes much more residue
of tumor. Ki67 staining demonstrates similar efficiency
pattern Figure 6E. In all, intravesical treatment exhibited
potent anti-cancer effect.

Previous report has shown that the oral metformin
in mice was 200mg/ml in drinking water [25],
approximately equivalent to around 1000 mg/kg/d with
gavage administration. To detect the toxicity of oral
treatment, 1600mg/kg/d in mice was applied to determine
the tolerance of mice. However, mice died successively
at this dose with acute toxicity and behaved severe
gastrointestinal side effects (data not shown). In contrast,
neither visual vomiting, gastrointestinal side effects nor
hematuria were observed in 800 mg/kg/d oral and two
intravesical groups (II, III and IV) although hematuria
is seen in Group I. Lactic acid and metformin in blood
samples increased markedly in 800 mg/kg/d oral treatment
(Group II) with maximum increase within two hours on
day 2 and 9 respectively. Amount of lactic acid maintained
within 7 hours whereas metformin disappeared sharply
(Figure 7). In contrast, lactic acid in Group IV does not
increase (Figure 7) and metformin is not detectable (data
not shown), indicating that intravesical administration
does neither increase any lactic acid nor any metformin
leak into blood circulating system.

DISCUSSION

In summary, the intravesical administration of
metformin yields a high rate of tumor clearance after 2
weeks therapy. In addition, intravesical treatment limits
systemic exposure and reduces non-specific toxicities.
This study has demonstrated the promising result of antibladder cancer effects in orthotopic preclinical animal
model. This will encourage us to further explore its
clinical application and/or combine metformin with other
chemotherapy.

In this study, we report pre-clinical results of
intravesical treatment using a syngeneic orthotopic bladder
cancer model and the molecular mechanism of mode of
action is elaborated.
Intravesical treatment of metformin showed a rapid
elimination of the implanted tumor twice per week after 2
weeks without any evidence of toxicity. Furthermore, mice
are very tolerated with these doses. Interestingly, our in
vitro data show that metformin at 0.5 mM enhances rather
than blocks colony formation (Figure 2A), indicating
that the sufficient dose is essential to exhibit anticancer
effect. A recent negative report of oral metformin on
pancreatic cancer from clinical trial strongly highlights
the importance of dose concentration on target organ [26].
At the other hand, increasing oral metformin does not help
to enhance its blood concentration rather than generating
more side effect due to pharmacokinetics of metformin
[27]. Higher dose of oral metformin arise gastrointestinal
discomfort and lactic acidosis [28], as evidenced in this
study as well. Markedly, intravesical administration is able
to overcome these obstacles and exhibit potent effects.
The basis of molecular anticancer mechanism of
metformin is activation of AMPK, proven by previous
reports [29]. Interestingly, metformin is able to increase
the longevity which is related to AMPK signaling pathway
as well [30–33]. Another new proposal is that metformin
functions primarily as antiforlate agent and secondarily as
AMK activator [34]. We present new findings that AKT
and ERK signaling participates in this event.

Cell viability and cologenic assay

Metformin and lactic acid measurement

Cell viability was assessed using a tetrazoliumbased assay using microplate reader (Biotek, SYNERGY
HTX, Vermont, USA). IC50 values were determined
through the dose-response curves.
Cologenic survival was defined as the ability of the
cells to form colonies. Images were taken and analyzed
by microscopy (Leica, DFC450C, Wetzlar, Germany) and
microplate reader (Biotek, SYNERGY HTX, Vermont,
USA).

Blood samples of mice were collected using the
process described previously [36] from 0.5 to 6h after
metformin was given via oral gavage. Blood lactic acid
levels were measured by lactic acid assay kit (SigmaAldrich) and metformin concentrations were determined
by HPLC, as reported previously [37].

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean±SEM. Statistical
analyses were carried out using ANOVA analysis and
statistical significance was assumed at a value of p<0.05.

Protein characterization
Western blot assessment was performed using
regular procedure in previous work [23]. Primary antibody
was added in BSA and allowed to incubate overnight at
4°C, then washed with TBS/0.05% Tween-20 before
secondary antibody was added and incubated for an
additional hour at room temperature. The membrane was
again washed 3 times before adding Pierce Super Signal
chemiluminescent substrate (Rockford, IL, USA) and then
immediately imaged on Chemi Doc (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). The films were scanned using EPSON
PERFECTION V500 PHOTO and quantified by Image J
(NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
