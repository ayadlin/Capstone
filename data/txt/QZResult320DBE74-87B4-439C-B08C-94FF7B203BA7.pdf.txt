ABSTRACT
The co-delivery of drug and gene has become the primary strategy in cancer
therapy. Based on our previous work, to co-deliver docetaxel (DOC) and MMP-9
siRNA more efficiently for HNE-1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma therapy, a folatemodified star-shaped copolymer (FA-CD-PLLD) consisting of β-cyclodextrin (CD) and
poly(L-lysine) dendron (PLLD) was synthesized, and then used for DOC and MMP-9
co-delivery. Different from commonly used amphiphilic copolymers micelles, the
obtained CD derivative could be used directly for the combinatorial delivery of nucleic
acid and hydrophobic DOC without a complicated micellization process. In vitro and
in vivo assays are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the target strategy
and combined treatment. It was found that the conjugation of CD-PLLD with FA
could enhance the DOC/MMP-9 delivery effect obviously, inducing a more significant
apoptosis and decreasing invasive capacity of HEN-1 cells. In vivo assays showed
that FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 could inhibit HNE-1 tumor growth and decrease PCNA
expression effectively, indicating a promising strategy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma
therapy. Moreover, the in vivo distribution of DOC and MMP-9, blood compatibility
and toxicity are also explored.

INTRODUCTION

synergistic actions, enhance the treatment effect
and deter the development of drug resistance [3].
For examples, He et al. prepared a drug and gene codelivery system through coordination using Zn2+
as the connecting point. The obtained coordination
liposome promoted the cellular uptake of cisplatin
and siRNA, and enabled efficient endosomal escape
in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells [4]. Li et al.
used poly(carboxybetaine) to conjugate camptothecin,
then assembled with cationic liposomes to form the drug
and gene dual carrier, which showed a synergistic tumor
suppression effect in tumor-bearing mice in vivo [5].
Chang et al. prepared the drug and gene co-delivering

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the
most common malignant tumors in Southern China [1].
The comprehensive treatment of radiotherapy combined
with chemotherapy is the main clinical treatment
strategy for NPC nowadays. However, the average
5-year survival rate of advanced NPC patients is still low
due to the easy tumor metastasis, multi-drug resistance
and so on [2].
Recently, the strategy of combining chemotherapy
with gene therapy has been promising in cancer
therapy, because this technique could promote

liposomes assembling from amphiphilic pillar [5] arene
capped with ferrocenium, which showed redox sensitivity
and effective drug/siRNA co-delivery [6].
In these assemble carriers, hydrophobic anticancer
drugs were incorporated into the hydrophobic cores, and
plasmid DNA or siRNA was bound to the hydrophilic
shells with cationic character. For the preparation of these
micelles, however, these self-assembly processes are
usually difficult to control, which was not easy to obtain
the stable and uniform complexes. Moreover, micelles was
not stable in blood circulation in vivo, the disassembly of
micelles may result in the drug emission [7–9].
Our collaborators have synthesized a star-shaped
cyclodextrin derivative (CD-PLLD) consisting of a
cyclodextrin (CD) core and poly(L-lysine) dendron
(PLLD) arms [10]. The CD core could interact with
hydrophobic model drug and the cationic arms could
bind pEGFP respectively, in which a complicated
micellization process is avoided. Moreover, PLLD is low
cytotoxicity and high transfection efficiency, which has
been applied widely in drug and gene delivery [11–14].
We have used this CD-PLLD to co-deliver docetaxel and
MMP-9 siRNA plasmid for NPC therapy. In vitro assay
indicated that CD-PLLD could co-deliver docetaxel
(DOC) and MMP-9 effectively into NPC HNE-1 cells
and the HNE-1 cells apoptosised obviously, which
suggested a potential application in drug and gene codelivery [15]. However, the deliver efficiency of CDPLLD should be improved.
It is reported that folate receptors (FRs) are
expressed at high levels in numerous cancers including
NPC HNE-1 cells, while low expression of FRs was
found in normal tissues [16–18]. Due to the strong
affinity between FRs and folate, many works have been
reported in which folate was used to modify carrier to
facilitate the internalization of the carriers into cancer
cells [19–22].
In this paper, we conjugated CD-PLLD with FA to
synthesize a FA-targeted drug and gene dual carrier, and
then use this carrier to co-deliver DOC and MMP-9 for
NPC treatment. In vitro and in vivo assays are carried
out to confirm the effectiveness of the target strategy and
combined treatment. And the in vivo distribution of DOC
and MMP-9 is also explored.

H NMR was used to confirm this. From Figure 1, all
signals of FA-CD-PLLD were marked. Except the peaks
from CD-PLLD, the characterized peaks at 6.5–8.0 ppm
were attributed to FA. This result indicated that the FAfunctionalized CD-PLLD was obtained successfully.
Particularly, the integral ratio (Ia/Ib of the proton resonance
signal at 7.65 ppm to that at 7.50 ppm was found to be
about 2.58, which indicated that 1 mol of CD-PLLD
reacted with about 2.58 mol of FA.

In vitro and in vivo target
In vitro target
We evaluated the targeted transfection efficiency
of MMP-9 siRNA plasmid into NPC cells. As shown in
Figure 2, the gene transfection efficiency in CNE-2 cells
with negative FR expression was lower, and less than 10%
CNE-2 cells were transfected. Correspondingly, the HNE-1
cells with high FR expression showed significantly higher
transfection efficiency than that in CNE-2 cells, and more
than 2 times of HNE-1 cells were transfected. The reason
was resulted from the molecular targeting phagocytosis
effect in addition to nonspecific phagocytosis effect.
To study further the targeting transfection effect of
FA-CD-PLLD/MMP-9 complexes to HNE-1 cells, RTPCR and Western blot analysis was carried out to detect
MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression. From the result
of Figure 3A, it was found that after targeting sequencespecific MMP-9 gene silencing by FA-CD-PLLD/MMP-9
complexes, the MMP-9 mRNA expression level was
reduced obviously. Its MMP-9 mRNA expression reduced
about 20% compared with CD-PLLD/MMP-9 group,
although CD-PLLD/MMP-9 mediated also the reduction
of MMP-9 mRNA. A reduction in MMP-9 mRNA was
subsequently accompanied by decreased MMP-9 protein
expression (Figure 3B and 3C), as determined by Western
blot analyses of MMP-9 protein in the cell lysates after
targeting transfection. It was found the samples treated
with targeting FA-CD-PLLD/MMP-9 showed the obvious
reduction of MMP-9 protein expression compared to the
non-targeting CD-PLLD/MMP-9, and the MMP-9 protein
expression reduced about 25%.

Synthesis of FA-CD-PLLD

To confirm the targeting delivery of FA-CD-PLLD/
DOC/MMP-9, the nude mice bearing both HNE-1 and
CNE-2 tumor model were set as shown in Figure 4A.
It showed a good linear relationship between DOC
concentration in tumor tissues and peak area, and the
standard curve of DOC and regression equation were
achieved as follow:
In HNE-1 tumor: Y (peak area) = 2474.3 × (DOC
concentration) + 799.96;

The star-shaped polymer, CD-PLLD, has been
synthesized in our previous work and showed drug/gene
co-delivery ability [15]. To improve the delivery ability
of CD-PLLD to HNE-1 cells, FA was conjugated to CDPLLD, and its chemical structure was shown in Scheme 1.
FA was conjugated by the amidation reaction between
the carboxyl groups of FA and amino groups of PLLD.

In CNE-2 tumor: Y (peak area) = 2496.8 × (DOC
concentration) − 272.89.
Then, the DOC concentration in tumor tissue
at different time (5 min, 30 min and 60 min) after tail
intravenous injection with FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9
were calculated, average concentrations of DOC in both
HNE-1 and CNE-2 tumor was 2.33 and 1.16 μg/g at
15 min, 5.39 and 2.65 μg/g at 30 min, 6.97 and 3.30 μg/g
at 60 min respectively, and the results were shown in
Figure 4B.
Via tail intravenous injection with nanocomposite
for 24 h, GFP expression in tumor tissues were shown in
Figure 4C. A stronger GFP expression was observed in
HNE-1 tumor than in CNE-2 tumor, which was consistent
with the DOC concentration analysis in tumors.

effectively, the percentage of cell apoptosis treated with
various formulations was determined by ﬂow cytometer.
As shown in Figure 5A, after incubation with FA-CDPLLD for 48 h, HNE-1 cells displayed limited apoptosis
and the apoptosis ratio showed no significant difference
with the control group, which demonstrated the nontoxicity of FA-CD-PLLD. After loading DOC and MMP-9,
the complexes showed obvious apoptosis to HNE-1 cells.
It was found that for the cells treated with CD-PLLD/
DOC/MMP-9, about 7% HNE-1 cells undergone
apoptosis. Further more, the percentage of HNE-1
apoptosis treated with FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9
reached up to 23.3%, much higher than that treated with
non-targeting CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9. These results
revealed that targeting co-deliverer of both MMP-9 and
DOC can signiﬁcantly enhance the cell apoptosis
To determine whether the targeting delivery of both
DOC and MMP-9 renders HNE-1 cells less invasion, a
transwell invasion assay was conducted on blank FA-CDPLLD, CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 and FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/
MMP-9. From Figure 5B, it was found that FA-CD-PLLD/
DOC/MMP-9 signiﬁcantly decreased cells invasion than

the group of CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9, and the ratio of
HNE-1 cells which were able to invade through matrigel
decreased obviously. FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 showed
the better therapy effect to HNE-1 cells in vitro compared
with non-targeting CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 through flow
apoptosis and cell invasion assays, which benefited from
the molecular targeting of FA.

Tumor PCNA expression in each group were shown in
Figure 6C. It was found that high level expression of
PCNA was observed in normal control group with the PI
of 94.02%, and the PI of the blank FA-CD-PLLD group,
CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 group and FA-CD-PLLD/
DOC/MMP-9 group were 90.53%, 48.73% and 5.16%
respectively. Compared with the control group and blank
FA-CD-PLLD group, PI in both CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9
group and FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 group were
decreased obviously, and FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9
group showed the best result.

In vivo therapy
The anti-tumor effect in vivo of FA-CD-PLLD/
DOC/MMP-9 was tested, and PBS was used as the
control. Nude mice implanted with HNE-1 tumors were
used as the animal models for this in vivo anti-tumor test.
The representative tumor images are shown in Figure 6A.
As is seen, the tumor volume of the FA-CD-PLLD treated
group increased rapidly after 21 d, and had no significant
difference in volume with the PBS control. However,
both of the DOC/MMP-9 treated groups were effective
in tumor regression, and more obvious inhibition effect
on HNE-1 tumor was found when treated with FA-CDPLLD/DOC/MMP-9. Figure 6B gave the HNE-1 tumor
growth profiles after treated with different groups, and the
same results were obtained. The group treated with FACD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 showed the smallest volume and
slowest growth rate.
PCNA is a cofactor of DNA polymerase δ which
is necessary for cell proliferation, so it is often used as

In vivo DOC and MMP-9 distribution
DOC concentration in each tissue (liver, kidney,
lung, heart, spleen and brain) was assayed according to
tert butyl methyl ether extraction method [24], and the
standard curves and regression equations were achieved
and shown in Electronic Supplementary Information.
The mean tissue concentrations of DOC after intravenous
administration of the FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 at
the DOC dose of 20 mg/kg at different times are shown
in Figure 7. The results demonstrated that DOC was
absorbed rapidly and distributed widely into most tissues
after intravenous administration of FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/
MMP-9, and the DOC concentration was the highest in
liver, followed by kidney, heart, spleen and lung. After 60

min circulation, DOC concentration decreased obviously
and there was no significant difference in different organs.
In addition, no DOC was detected in the brain of the nude
mice.
The MMP-9 distribution was also studied through
GFP expression observed in tissue frozen section, shown
in Figure 8. Similar to DOC distribution, GFP expression
can be observed in all assayed organs except brain, and
liver and kidney frozen sections showed stronger GFP.

hemolytic with the extent of hemolysis lower than the
permissible level of 5% [25].
The cytotoxicity of FA-CD-PLLD was evaluated on
HNE-1 cells by an MTT assay. Figure 9B gave the cell
viabilities result of the HNE-1 cells cultured in the media
treated with different FA-CD-PLLD or PEI concentrations.
As seen, FA-CD-PLLD had an obviously lower toxicity
than PEI. The cell viability was higher than 90% even if
FA-CD-PLLD concentration reached as high as 500 μg/mL.
Contrarily, the viability of HNE-1 cells treated with
500 μg/mL PEI was lower than 50%.
In vivo toxicity studies are essential to prove
the safety of any polymers used as gene delivery.
Herin, a histological analysis of organs was performed
to determine whether FA-CD-PLLD caused tissue
damage, inflammation, or lesions. As shown in
Figure 10, histologically, no visible difference was
observed compared to the control (top row).

Biocompatibility
The biocompatibility is a key factor for FA-CDPLLD as the drug and gene dual carrier. Herein, the
hemolysis, in vitro and in vivo toxicity were tested to
confirm the good biocompatibility of FA-CD-PLLD. The
blood compatibility of FA-CD-PLLD was assessed by
spectrophotometric measurement of hemoglobin release
from erythrocytes after polymer treatment. Figure 9A
showed the percentage of blood in contact with FA-CDPLLD or PEI with different concentrations. It was found
that PEI caused serious hemolysis in a concentrationdependent manner as a result of the erythrocyte
membrane disruption, while FA-CD-PLLD showed a
much better blood compatibility. When the FA-CD-PLLD
concentration was up to 500 μg/mL, it showed non-

survival rate is about 50%. The co-delivery of drug and
gene has become the primary strategy in cancer and other
disease therapy in recent years [3].
Our collaborators have synthesized a star-shaped
cyclodextrin derivative (CD-PLLD) consisting of a
cyclodextrin (CD) core and poly(L-lysine) dendron
(PLLD) arms [10]. We have used this CD-PLLD to codeliver docetaxel and MMP-9 siRNA plasmid for NPC
therapy [15]. However, the deliver efficiency of CD-PLLD

should be improved. Using folate as the ligand, a wide
variety of drug payloads can be delivered to FR-positiver
cells, ranging from small radioactive imaging agents up
to large DNA-containing formulations, folate modified
nanomedicine had more obvious inhibition effect on tumor
cells in a short treating time and lower concentration via
molecular targeting phagocytosis FR pathway [26, 27].
In this paper, we conjugated CD-PLLD with FA by the
amidation reaction to synthesize a FA-targeted drug and

gene dual carrier, and then use this carrier to co-deliver
DOC and MMP-9 for NPC treatment.
From in vitro target results, it was confirmed that
the FA-CD-PLLD could targeting deliver MMP-9 siRNA
plasmid effectively into HNE-1 cells. In vivo target
experiment, for DOC distribution analysis, compared
to liquid–liquid anhydrous diethyl ether extraction
method [28], we found tissue sample extracted by low
toxicity tert-butyl methyl ether can be blown dry easily
by nitrogen, and the higher DOC extraction rate in tissue
was acquired [24]. Because of the two compartment
model of drug distribution, after tail intravenous injection,
nanomedicines were distributed immediately in central
compartment of organs with abundant blood supply such
as liver, heart, kidney and so on, concentration of DOC
dropped fastly following with accelerated blood flow, and
then nanomedicines were distributed slowly in peripheral
compartment of organs with less blood flow such as skin,
fat, bone and so on, and GFP expression in vivo was
similar to DOC distribution. These results indicated that
FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 complexes could be stable
in blood circulation and could not escape phagocytosis
effectively in meshy endodermis system such as liver
and spleen, which need to improve further. Moreover, the
complexes could not cross the blood–brain barrier because
of its larger molecular size which confirmed its relative
safety. Because the nanomedicine can be swallowed by
tumor cell easily and accumulate in the tumor tissues for
its enhanced permeability and retention effect (ERP effect)
[29, 30], so DOC concentrations in both HNE-1 and CNE2 tumor increased with the prolonged blood circulation
time. Moreover, the DOC concentration in HNE-1 tumor
was significantly higher than that in CNE-2 tumor because
of the molecular targeting property of FA-CD-PLLD/
DOC/MMP-9 nanocomposite. GFP expression in HNE-1
tumor was stronger than that in CNE-2 tumor, which was
consistent with the DOC concentration analysis in tumors.
It showed FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 nanocomposite
had a good targeting ability to achieve the high DOC
concentration and gene transfection efficiency in HNE-1
tumor. and FA-CD-PLLD was considered as a promising
targeting gene and drug carrier.
Cell apoptosis was determined by ﬂow cytometer.
Annexin V-FITC staining in conjunction with PI can
distinguish early apoptosis from late apoptosis or living
cells from necrotic cells [31]. In vitro therapeutic results
revealed FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 showed the
better therapeutic effect on HNE-1 cells compared to
non-targeting CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 through flow
apoptosis and cell invasion assays, which benefited from
the molecular targeting of FA. In vivo treatment results
also showed anti-tumor effcet was most obvious in FACD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 treated group by analysed
tumor volume and PCNA expression. The results were
attributed to the targeting effect of FA-CD-PLLD, which
could accumulate DOC and MMP-9 in tumor tissue and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

penetrate into tumor deep [32]. The targeting co-delivering
strategy is promising in cancer therapy [32].
The instability of delivery vehicles in the blood
was considered as one of the serious limitations in the
therapeutic of cationic polymers [33]. The nonspecific
interactions of cationic polymers with blood components
could severely diminish the half-life and targetability of
complexes. FA-CD-PLLD showed a much better blood
compatibility and in vitro obviously lower toxicity
than PEI. The in vivo toxicity of polymers is influenced
by the chemical structures, size, exposure duration,
biodistribution, location, metabolism as well as the nature
of the surface and terminal groups. The toxicity of FACD-PLLD also depends on its type, molecular weight
and generation [34]. The non-observed toxicity of starshaped FA-CD-PLLD could be attributed to its lower
molecular weight (less than 5 KDa) and the characteristic
of molecular structure, such as the biodegradability
and carrying a positive charge only on the surface. The
biodegradability of FA-CD-PLLD can also promote its
elimination from organism and thereby enhance the in vivo
biocompatibility [35].
In conclusion, in vitro and in vivo assays showed
that FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 as the co-delivery of
hydrophobic drug and gene can efficiently exert targeted
anti-tumor effect. It indicated a promising strategy for
targeted NPC synergy therapy.

CD-PLLD has been synthesized according to our
previous work [10]. Docetaxel (DOC) was purchased
from Sigma and used without further purification.
MMP-9 siRNA plasmid vector expressing EGFP was
purchased from Invitrogen Company (Shanghai).
1-hydroxybenzotriazole
(HOBt),
O-benzotriazoleN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluromium
hexafluorophosphate
(HBTU) and folate (FA) were obtained from Aladdin Ltd
(Shanghai) and dried before use. RPMI-1640 medium,
fetal bovine serum, Propidium Iodide (PI) and PBS
purchased from Invitrogen Company. Human NPC HNE-1
cells and CNE-2 cells were provided by Southern Medical
University. BALB/c mice and BALB/c nude mice (SPF)

After 48 h reaction at room temperature, the mixture was
dialyzed in distilled water for 3 d (MWCO = 3000). The
FA-CD-PLLD was obtained by lyophilization with a yield
of 68%. Its chemical structure was characterized by lH
NMR analyses. The 1H NMR spectra were measured in
DMSO-d6 by using a Bruker DPX-300 NMR spectrometer
(300 MHz) at 25°C.

per well onto 12-well tissue culture plates in complete
DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) culture
medium respectively, and then incubated in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Freshly prepared FA-CDPLLD/MMP-9 (N/P = 20) complexes in serum-free
RPMI-1640 were added. The MMP-9 in each well was
fixed at 3.0 μg. After 2 h incubation, the formulations were
removed and 500 μL of fresh DMEM culture medium
was added. The experiments of studying gene transfection
were continued to 46 h, and then the cells were analyzed
for green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression with a
fluorescence microscope (Nikon-2000 U, Japan). The
cells treated with PEI/MMP-9 (N/P = 10) were set as the
control groups. After the cells were digested by trypsinase
(0.05 wt% in PBS), the transfection percents (positive
cell percent) were calculated by dividing the number of
fluorescent cells by the number of total cells in a certain
area of a well. The transfection efficiency was recorded
by a flow cytometer (Accuri C6).

DOC loading
For the loading of hydrophobic DOC, 50 mg
FA-CD-PLLD was dissolved in distilled water with a
concentration of 10 mg/mL, then 5 mL DMF containing
15 mg DOC was added dropwise to the solution. The
mixture was stirred for 4 h in the dark at room temperature.
After that, the sample was put into a dialysis bag
(MWCO = 500) and subjected to dialysis against distilled
water for 24 h. The drug-loaded complex was obtained by
ﬁltered through a 0.45 μm ﬁlter and then lyophilized.
To determine the loading amount of DOC, the
resultant FA-CD-PLLD/DOC complexes were dissolved
in CH3OH and then analyzed by HPLC. The HPLC
analysis of DOC was achieved on a C18 column (Waters,
USA) with a mobile phase consisting of methanol and
purity water (70/30, v/v) at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
The effluents were monitored at 227 nm and quantized by
comparing the peak areas with the standard curve [36].
It was found that the loading amount of DOC in FA-CDPLLD was 38.4 μg/mg.

mRNA and protein expression
HNE-1 cells (5 × 104) were seeded in 6-well plates
and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h to reach 70%
confluence. Various formulations (Blank FA-CD-PLLD,
CD-PLLD/MMP-9 and FA-CD-PLLD/MMP-9) were
added and incubated with the cells for 48 h (for mRNA
isolation and protein extraction). The cellular levels of
MMP-9 mRNA and protein were assessed using RT-PCR
and Western blot, respectively.
In RT-PCR analysis, total RNA from transfected
cells was isolated using the AxyPrep Multisource
total RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen, USA) according to
the protocol of manufacturer. 1 mg of total RNA was
transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScriptTM RT reagent
Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Japan). Thereafter, 2 μL
of cDNA was subjected to RT-PCR analysis targeting
MMP-9 and β-actin using Premix Taq Version 2.0 (Takara,
Japan). PCR parameters consisted of 35 cycles of PCR
(denaturation at 95°C for 30 sec, annealing at 58°C for
30 sec, and elongation at 72°C for 30 sec). The PCR
products were run on 2% agarose gel with Ethidium
bromide and visualized in Gel DocTM XR+ imaging
system (Bio-Rad). Relative gene expression values were
determined using Quality One Software. Primers used in
RT-PCR for MMP-9 and β-actin are:
MMP-9-forward 5ʹ-GAGAAGAGAGGGCCCAGC-3ʹ

In Western blot analysis, transfected cells were
washed twice with cold PBS, and then resuspended in
100 μL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2,

MMP-9 binding
The best siRNA plasmid targeting MMP-9 has
been screened out in our previous work [15], showing
in Electronic Supplementary Information. For FA-CDPLLD, the optimized N/P ratio was 20, which was shown
in Electronic Supplementary Information (Supplementary
Figure S1). Then, FA-CD-PLLD and MMP-9 were
dissolved in distilled water to make aqueous solutions
respectively and then mixed at an N/P ratio of 20. The
resultant mixture was stirred gently for 15 min for the
formation of FA-CD-PLLD/MMP-9 complexes. For
the preparation of co-loaded nanoparticles, FA-CDPLLD/DOC complex was mixed with MMP-9 at an N/P
ratio of 20. The resultant mixture was stirred gently for
15 min for the formation of FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9
nanoparticles.

Targeting analysis

in the tumor tissue frozen section was observed under the
fluorescence microscope.

Inhibitor PMSF Tablets. The cell lysates were incubated
on ice for 30 min and vortexed every 5 min. The lysates
were then clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 12 000
r/min. The supernatant was boiled in loading buffer for
10 min. Total protein (20 μL) was separated (at 120 V for
40 min) on 12% PAGE-SDS gels and then transferred (at
300 mA for 40 min) to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). After
incubation in 5% BSA (Merck, Germany) in phosphate
buffered saline with Tween-20 (PBST, pH 7.2) for 1 h.
The membranes were incubated in 5% BSA in PBST with
MMP-9 antibodies (1:1000) over night. After incubation in
5% BSA in PBST with goat anti rabbit IgG-HRP antibody
(1:5000) for 60 min, bands were visualized using the ECL
system (Pierce). Relative gene expression values were
determined using Image-J Software.

NPC HNE-1 therapy
Apoptosis assay
HNE-1 cells seeded on the 24-well plates were
treated with FA-CD-PLLD, CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9
and FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 (DOC concentration of
0.192 μg and MMP-9 concentration of 2 μg/well) at 37°C
for 48 h. Cells without treatment were used as control. At
the end of incubation, all cells were trypsinized, collected
and resuspended in 200 μL of binding buffer. Thereafter,
5 μL of annexin V-FITC and 10 μL of PI were added
and mixed for 15 min in the dark. The stained cells were
analyzed using a flow cytometer.

In vivo assay
Nude mice implanted with HNE-1 and CNE-2
tumors were used as the animal model for in vivo targeting
analysis. HNE-1 cells (1 × 107 cells in 200 μL PBS) and
CNE-2 cells (1 × 107 cells in 200 μL PBS) were injected
subcutaneously on the right and left axillary flank of
female BALB/c nude mice respectively. After the tumors
grown with suitable size a few days later, the nude mice
were sacrificed, and the removed HNE-1 and CNE-2
tumors were cut into small patchs at aseptic conditions.
Then, the tumors were transplanted to the right and left
axillary flank of 5 nude mice respectively, and all nude
mice were aged 4–5 weeks and weighed 17–20 g. Then all
nude mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection
of chloral hydrate, and injected with FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/
MMP-9 through tail vein at DOC doses of 19.2 μg/g and
MMP-9 doses of 25 μg/g.

Cell invasion assay
For invasion assays, the cells were plated into
6-well dishes in triplicate at high density. The cells were
serum starved for 12 h before performing the assay, and
BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers were used for
invasion assays. After starvation, cells were trypsinized
and 2.5 × 104 cells were plated in 0.2 mL PRMI 1640 with
0.5% FBS in the upper chamber. In the lower chamber,
0.5 mL PRMI 1640 with 10% FBS was used as an
attractant. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Invading
cells on the lower surface of the membranes were stained
with 0.3% crystal violet stain and counted manually.

In vivo tumor inhibition

DOC distribution

Nude mice implanted with HNE-1 tumors were used
as the animal model for in vivo anti-tumor test. The mice
were divided into 4 groups randomized, each group was
5 mice. Subsequently, the mice were intravenously
injected via tail vein with 200 μL PBS (pH=7.4, as
control), FA-CD-PLLD, CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 and
FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 at DOC doses of 9.6 μg/g
and MMP-9 doses of 12.5 μg/g at the 1st, 6th, 11th and
16th day respectively. After 3 weeks, all groups of mice
were sacrificed. The tumor volume was calculated by the
formula W × L2/2, where W is the widest diameter, and L
is the longest diameter.
The tumor tissues from the mice treated with
different samples were selected for histology observation
on the 21st day after treatment. The tumors were dissected
and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, routinely
processed into paraffin, sectioned at a thickness of 5 mm.
The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was used
to evaluate the proliferation ability of the cells in the left
tumors. The slices obtained were examined by optical
microscopy.

After administration, nude mice bearing HNE-1 and
CNE-2 tumor were sacriﬁced at 5 min, 30 min and 60 min
respectively, and the tumors were rapidly resected. Tumor
samples were rinsed with ice saline, dried by filter paper
and homogenized with saline according to 1:2 ratio of
tumor weight/saline doses. After that, the tumor samples
were extracted by tert-butyl methyl ether. 0.2 mL of tumor
tissue sample and 1.2 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether were
mixed for 5 min by vortex to extract, then the total organic
layer was separated by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10
min, transferred to a clean tube, and evaporated to dryness
at 40°C under a stream of nitrogen. The drug residue was
ﬁnally reconstituted in 0.4 mL acetonitrile followed by
centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 5 min before analysis. The
DOC concentrations were determined by the HPLC.

humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37ºC. After 24 h,
the growth medium was replaced with 200 μL complete
DMEM culture medium that contained the desired amount
of FA-CD-PLLD or PEI respectively. Five multiple holes
were set for every sample. The cells treated with the same
amount of PBS were used as a control group. The cells
were incubated for another 48 h, and the cell viability was
assayed by adding 20 μL of MTT (Sigma) PBS solution
(5 mg/mL). After incubation at 37 ºC for another 4 h, the
formed crystals were dissolved in 150 μL of DMSO. The
absorbance that correlated with the number of viable cells
in each well was measured by an MRX-Microplate Reader
at a test wavelength of 490 nm.

For DOC and MMP-9 in vivo distribution, the nude
mice bearing HNE-1 tumor model were firstly established
described as 2.5.3. Then the nude mice were intravenously
injected via tail vein with FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 at
DOC doses of 19.2 μg/g and MMP-9 doses of 25 μg/g.

DOC distribution
After administration, nude mice were sacriﬁced
at 5 min, 30 min and 60 min respectively. The main
tissues (liver, kidney, lung, heart, spleen and brain)
were rapidly resected respectively. Tissue samples were
removed, rinsed with ice saline, dried by filter paper and
homogenized with saline according to 1:2 ratio of tissue
weight/saline doses respectively. The DOC concentrations
were determined by the HPLC.

In vivo toxicity
The FA-CD-PLLD (500 mg/kg mouse) was
dissolved in PBS and injected into 7 female BALB/c mice
(4-week old, 18 ± 2 g) through tail vein, and physiological
saline was used as control reagent. After 7 days, all
animals were sacrificed, and the liver, heart, brain, spleen
and kidney were separated, washed twice with PBS and
fixed in 4% formaldehyde for histological examination.

MMP-9 distribution
Nude mice were sacrified after 24 h via tail vein
injection of nanocomposites, each tissue (liver, kidney,
lung, heart, spleen and brain) was resected immediately,
and GFP expression in the tissue frozen section was
observed under the fluorescence microscope.

Statistical analysis
Comparison between groups was analyzed by the
one-tailed Student’s t-test using statistical software SPSS
11.5. All data are presented as means ± S.D. Differences
were considered to be statistically significant when the
P values were less than 0.05.

Biocompatibility
Blood compatibility
The blood compatibility of CD-PLLD was evaluated
by its hemolysis assay. For each sample, its hemolytic
potential was tested according to the method reported
by O’Leary and Guess [37]. Human blood (0.1 mL)
anticoagulated with citrate was added to 5 mL of PBS
containing the samples with different amounts in test
tubes. Separate positive (100% hemolysis induced by
replacing the PBS with 5 mL of 0.1% Na2CO3 solution)
and negative (0% hemolysis, PBS with no material added)
controls were also set up. Each set of experiments was
carried out for three times. All the test tubes containing the
samples and the control were incubated for 1 h at 37°C.
After the incubation, the tubes were centrifuged at 500 rpm
for 5 min. The percentage hemolysis was calculated by
measuring the optical density (OD) of the supernatant
solution at 545 nm in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer as per
the following formula:
Hemolysis (%) = [(OD of the test sample - OD of
negative control) × 100]/OD of positive control.

CONCLUSIONS
For the targeting co-delivery of hydrophobic drug
and gene effectively, a FA modified star-shaped copolymer
(FA-CD-PLLD) has been synthesized and used to
targeting co-deliver DOC and MMP-9 for nasopharyngeal
cancer therapy. The obtained FA-CD-PLLD showed a
good molecular targeting ability in vitro and in vivo, and
could targeting mediate a signiﬁcant reduce of MMP-9
protein in HNE-1 cells. The FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9
could enhance the DOC/MMP-9 delivery effect obviously,
inducing a more significant apoptosis and decreasing
invasive capacity of HEN-1 cells. In vivo assays showed
that FA-CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 could inhibit HNE-1
tumor growth and decrease PCNA expression effectively.
Moreover, FA-CD-PLLD showed the good blood
compatibility and non-toxicity, indicating a promising
strategy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma therapy.
