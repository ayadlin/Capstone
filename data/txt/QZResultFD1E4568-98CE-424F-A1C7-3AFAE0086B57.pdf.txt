ABSTRACT:
Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer that retains functional p53
and p73, and drug unresponsiveness largely depends on defects in death pathways
after epigenetic gene silencing in conjunction with an imbalanced p73/DNp73 ratio.
We constructed oncolytic viruses armed with an inhibitor of deacetylation and/or
p73 to specifically target metastatic cancer. Arming of the viruses is aimed at lifting
epigenetic blockage and re-opening apoptotic programs in a staggered manner
enabling both, efficient virus replication and balanced destruction of target cells
through apoptosis. Our results showed that cooperative expression of shHDAC1 and
p73 efficiently enhances apoptosis induction and autophagy of infected cells which
reinforces progeny production. In vitro analyses revealed 100% cytotoxicity after
infecting cells with OV.shHDAC1.p73 at a lower virus dose compared to control viruses.
Intriguingly, OV.shHDAC1.p73 acts as a potent inhibitor of highly metastatic xenograft
tumors in vivo. Tumor expansion was significantly reduced after intratumoral injection
of 3 x 108 PFU of either OV.shHDAC1 or OV.p73 and, most important, complete
regression could be achieved in 100 % of tumors treated with OV.shHDAC1.p73. Our
results point out that the combination of high replication capacity and simultaneous
restoration of cell death routes significantly enhance antitumor activity.

INTRODUCTION

pathways in virtually all tumor types that is able to
repress melanoma initiation and progression is p53 [4,
5]. In melanoma, however, unlike most other aggressive
and chemoresistant cancers, mutations in the TP53 gene
occur rarely [6]. Instead, epigenetic events including
aberrant promoter methylation or histone deacetylation
leading to the loss of expression of upstream activators
and/or downstream effector proteins such as p14Arf or
Apaf-1 that prevent the execution of apoptotic programs
is frequent [7]. In this regard, previous work has shown
a significant correlation between gene hypermethylation
and increasing primary tumor Breslow thickness, which
is associated with a high risk of metastasis development
in melanoma patients [8, 9]. Given that these alterations
in p53-dependent death pathways are reversible and

Malignant melanoma is one of the most
aggressive human cancers with steadily increasing
incidence. Melanoma-associated mortality accounts for
approximately 75% of all skin cancer related fatalities
[1]. The main cause of death in melanoma patients is
widespread metastasis. Metastatic disease is refractory
to all current forms of therapy and has an overall poor
prognosis without effective cure. Malignant progression
of melanomas is associated with numerous defects in cell
cycle checkpoint controls, survival and apoptotic pathways
[2] that are topped by both, genetic and epigenetic events
ultimately establishing the aggressive phenotype [3].

restoration of, for example, Apaf-1 by treatment with the
methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine could rescue
the observed apoptotic defects [10], reversing epigenetic
changes may lead to a targeted therapy of advanced
melanomas.
Another member of the p53 family that shares target
gene promoters with p53 is p73. p73 exists as multiple
functionally diverse protein variants that originate from
alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage.
Whereas the full-length isoform (TAp73) containing a
transactivation domain has similar biological functions
as p53, amino-terminally truncated DNp73 proteins
are transactivation-deficient displaying antagonistic
activities. TAp73 induces apoptosis and sensitizes cells to
chemotherapy, which is blocked by DNp73 through either
interfering with the binding of p53 and TAp73 to target
promoters or by forming inactive heteromeric complexes
with TAp73 [11]. Prognosis, disease-free survival and
chemotherapeutic response in a number of human cancers
are worse when the levels of the anti-apoptotic and
oncogenic DNp73 variants are elevated as compared to
the TA isoforms [12-14]. Characteristic for melanoma is
that inhibitory DNp73 isoforms are aberrantly expressed
in what are otherwise wild-type p53/p73 positive invasive
and metastatic tumors [15, 16], suggesting that high
levels of the oncogenic protein may contribute to the low
frequency of mutations in both tumor suppressor genes
in late tumor stages. We recently reported that DNp73
promotes melanoma metastasis by triggering EMT, cell
migration and invasion, which is achieved by direct
interference with wild-type p73-dependent stimulation of
the tumor suppressor LIMA1/EPLIN [16]. This led to the
adoption that the aggressive cancer phenotype and its lack
of sensitivity to DNA damaging agents is to a large extent
determined by the ratio of apoptotic to anti-apoptotic p73
proteins. DNp73 was shown to mediate drug resistance
of metastatic melanoma through inhibiting p73-dependent
miR-205 expression with subsequent recovery of antiapoptotic factors like Bcl-2 [17]. Furthermore, increased
sensitivity towards chemotherapy and growth inhibition of
tumor xenografts in mice was achieved by specific DNp73
depletion leading to the induction of apoptotic p73 [18].
Following these observations our alternative approach
is aimed to shift the balance in favor of an efficient
destruction of metastatic cells by overexpressing TAp73
in conjunction with an HDAC1 inhibitor in a replicating
adenovirus (Ad).
HDAC1 is responsible for the removal of acetyl
moieties from histone lysine residues, leading to the
exposure of the lysine’s positive charge. Negatively
charged DNA in turn is able to bind tightly to the histone
proteins, which increases chromatin condensation.
Generally, condensed chromatin is believed to impede
access of transcription factors to the DNA and thus, causes
a decrease in overall cellular transcription activity. Histone
acetylation has also been associated with other important
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cellular functions like DNA repair, recombination, and
chromatin assembly [19]. Moreover, deacetylation of
histone H3K14 is a prerequisite for methylation of H3K9,
which is typical for transcriptionally silenced regions
[20]. HDAC1 not only deacetylates histones, but also
other proteins, decreasing transcriptional activity of the
deacetylated protein with p53 being a very prominent
example [21]. Chemical inhibitors of histone deacetylases
have been shown to induce apoptosis and to sensitize cells
to chemotherapy or radiotherapy in cell culture and animal
models [22-24]. Further, it has been shown that HDAC
inhibitors are able to trigger cell death in human papilloma
virus positive cells by inducing the E2F-p73 pathway [25].
Different attempts have been made to improve the
efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OV) through expression
of therapeutic genes in infected tumor cells [26, 27]. In
order to restore epigenetically blocked apoptotic pathways
in metastatic melanoma cells and, in consequence, to
enhance the cytolytic effect after virus infection, we
generated different OVs encoding either shRNA against
histone deacetylase 1 (shHDAC1), the p73 gene, or both
elements together in a timely coordinated manner.
Here, we demonstrate that the combination of
ectopic p73 expression after knockdown of HDAC1
synergistically generates enhanced cytotoxicity in
metastatic melanoma cells. The deactivated death
programs could be restored by first lifting the epigenetic
blockade to subsequently allow transactivation of p73
and p53 target genes. Most intriguingly, concurrent
deacetylation activity and pro-apoptotic protein expression
by the OV.shHDAC1.p73 virus enhances autophagy of
infected melanoma cells that efficiently reinforces progeny
production. Our results emphasize the importance of
pursuing synchronous cytotoxic strategies to treat highly
therapy-resistant cancers using tumor specific replicative
oncolytic viruses that spares healthy cells.

RESULTS
Construction of oncolytic adenoviruses expressing
either shRNA against HDAC1, the p73 gene, or
both effectors simultaneously
In order to construct oncolytic adenoviruses with
enhanced cytotoxicity, we modified the Addelta24 virus
[28]. A hallmark of this virus is its replication restriction
to cancerous cells due to a 24bp deletion in the E1A gene
(E1Adelta24) which is essential for binding to the Rb
protein. Due to the abolished binding of Rb to E1A, the
subsequent release of E2F1 from the inhibitory E2F1-Rb
complex is prevented, thus limiting the viral replication to
cells with abnormal Rb control, which is commonly seen
in melanoma. In clinical trials, oncolytic adenoviruses
designed for cancer therapy have shown limited success

[29]. Therefore, arming OVs with therapeutic genes is
necessary to enhance their oncolytic efficacy. To address
chemoresistance of malignant melanoma due to defects
in death pathways, we aimed at apoptosis reactivation by

concomitant expression of two effectors of apoptosis: p73
and an shRNA to suppress HDAC1 to reopen apoptotic
routes. Figure 1A gives a schematic overview of all
oncolytic viruses constructed in this study in comparison

compared to wild-type adenovirus. A 24 bp deletion in the E1A gene (E1Adelta24) restricts OV replication to cells with inactive pRb.
Furthermore, OVs harbor a deletion in the E3-region known from AdEasyI to enable efficient virus packaging after recombining the viral
genomes. In OV.Luc, the luciferase gene is expressed bicistronically together with the fiber gene. OV.shHDAC1.Luc in addition, contains
the gene for an shRNA directed against HDAC1 under control of the H1-promoter. In OV.p73 the luciferase gene is replaced by the p73
gene and OV.shHDAC1.p73 combines the expression of both, the p73 and the shRNA gene directed against HDAC1. (B) p73 and HDAC1

(Ad.Empty), or vectors able to transduce the cells either
with an shRNA against GFP (Ad.shGFP), an shRNA
against HDAC1 (Ad.shHDAC1) or TP73 (Ad.p73) were
used as expression controls (Figure 1B, upper panel). As
expected, strong p73 protein expression at comparable
levels was observed in cells treated with the replicating
and replication-deficient virus. Cells treated with OV.p73
showed a distinctly higher p73 protein level compared
to OV.shHDAC1.p73, which can be explained with
the recent finding that HDAC1 regulates p73 protein
stability via HSP90 interaction [30]. In melanoma cells
infected with viruses containing shHDAC1, the histone
deacetylase level was significantly reduced via inhibiton
of the HDAC1 mRNA by the specific shRNA (Figure 1B,

Burst assays were performed on SK-Mel-147 cells
to evaluate the progeny production of viruses. Cells and
supernatants were collected 24, 36, and 48 hours after
infection with the OVs at MOIs of 1 and the viral titers
were estimated by TCID50 determination (Figure 1C). The
low MOI was chosen to reduce re-infection events during
the observation time. Within 24 hours, the OV expressing
both apoptosis effectors replicated faster than the parental
virus. After 48 hours, the virus titer reached almost the
same level as the parental virus. Interestingly, both OVs
that express either p73 or shHDAC-1 alone showed overall
lower replication capacities than OV.shHDAC1.p73. From
these experiments we conclude that the combination
of both effectors does not significantly hamper virus
replication. Additionally performed real-time PCR data
revealed that replication of viral DNA at 48 hours after

infection with OV.Luc was roughly 2-fold higher than in
cells infected with OV.shHDAC1.p73 (Figure 1D). These
data demonstrate the efficient replication characteristics
of OV.shHDAC1.p73 where progeny production is
comparable to the parental OV. The replication capacities
of OV.Luc and OV.shHDAC1.p73 were also tested in
other cancer cell lines and compared with that in SKMel-147. Both, the non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line
H1299 and A549 adenocarcinoma cells were infected, and
progeny assays were performed 72 hours post-infection.
In all cell lines tested OV.Luc progeny production was
higher than that of OV.shHDAC1.p73 basically reflecting
the data shown in Figure 1D (Figure 1E). Virus replication
is even higher in other cell lines and occurs independent
of whether they express wild-type p53 or not. These data
support the validity of OV.shHDAC1.p73 as a candidate
for the treatment of other cancers irrespective of their p53

play a vital role to consider them as therapeutic agents.
Infection with OV.shHDAC1.p73 at MOI 10 resulted
in a significantly lower viability of SK-Mel-147 cells
compared to all other viruses examined (Figure 2A).
Strikingly, the percentage of cell viability 48 hours after
infection with OV.shHDAC1.p73 decreased to 37%, in
comparison to 76% for OV.Luc. In contrast, infection with

values comparable to OV.Luc or slightly below. These
results clearly demonstrate that the OV expressing both
effector genes has the highest cytotoxic potential in these
metastatic melanoma cells.
These data were confirmed by dose-dependent
cytotoxicity assays. As shown in Figure 2B, infection of
two distinct highly aggressive melanoma cell lines with
OV.shHDAC1.p73 at MOI 1 was sufficient to achieve
100% cytotoxicity within 7 days, whereas the cytotoxic
potential of the other viruses was significantly lower.
Moreover, cells infected with the virus expressing both
effectors exhibited clearly visible cytotoxicity at the very
low MOI of 0.1, while cells infected with any of the other
viruses did not show any signs of cytopathic effects.
Replication-deficient Ad vectors expressing shHDAC1 or
p73 were not cytotoxic at MOI 0.1.

infection (Supplementary Figure 2). Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP) is usually involved in DNA repair
and a direct target for activated caspase 3. The intensity
of PARP cleavage was confirmed and most prominent in
cells infected with the replicating agent expressing both
apoptosis effectors (Figure 3D) and proves once more
the potential to induce apoptosis in cancer cells while
replicating efficiently.
Macroautophagy, usually referred to as autophagy,
plays an important role in cellular homeostasis and
occurs as a response to stress forms such as starvation
or infection by intracellularly replicating pathogens [33,
34]. It is known that infection with replication-competent
adenoviruses involves induction of autophagy [35, 36]
and this suggests that autophagy plays a critical role in
viral structural protein synthesis likely by degrading
intracellular components necessary to assemble progeny
virus particles. Since autophagy might modulate the
virus replication, we also investigated this catabolic
mechanism by detecting the autophagy related marker
LC3. Conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II is needed for
autophagosome formation and the ratio of LC3-II to
LC3-I represents the autophagic flux of the cell. Figure
4A shows that LC3 conversion can be observed after
infection with OV.Luc and to a lesser extend after
infection with OV.shHDAC1.Luc and OV.p73. Cells
infected with OV.shHDAC1.p73, however, exhibit a
significantly increased ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I than the
three other viruses. The strongest authophagy induction
through OV.shHDAC1.p73 was also confirmed by
the detection of Beclin-1 and Atg3 in Western blot and
immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 4B). These
results indicate that not only apoptosis induction in
OV.shHDAC1.p73 infected cells is distinctly higher
than in cells treated with other oncolytic viruses, but
also autophagy takes part in cellular disassembly. In
comparison to vector controls, it becomes obvious that
autophagy strongly depends on virus replication rather
than overexpression of pro-apoptotic genes (Figure 4).
Taken together, these observations clearly show that
autophagy is induced by OV.shHDAC1.p73, which
enhances viral progeny production and ultimately, cellular
impairment. Further studies are needed to investigate
the factors responsible for autophagy induction in
OV.shHDAC1.p73 treated cells.

Induction of apoptosis and autophagy after
infection with oncolytic viruses
As previous reports demonstrated increased
apoptosis after HDAC1 inhibition [31] or p73
overexpression [32] in melanoma cells, the capability of
our oncolytic viruses to induce apoptosis was analyzed.
Hoechst 33342 staining after 24 hours of cells infected
at MOIs of 2 yielded the highest rate of apoptotic cells
when treated with OV.shHDAC1.p73 (Figure 3A, upper
panel). Significantly lower amounts of apoptotic cells
were detected after infection with OVs expressing p73 or
shHDAC1 alone (Figure 3A, lower panel). The percentage
of apoptotic cells using TAp73, DNp73, p53 or shHDAC1
independently of each other expressed by a replicationdeficient Ad vector is shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
To distinguish between necrosis by viral
replication and apoptosis by repression of HDAC1 and
overexpression of p73, we monitored the changes in
expression of the pro-apoptotic genes Apaf-1, Bax, Bim,
and PUMA 48 hours after infection of SK-Mel-147 cells
with the oncolytic viruses by real-time PCR. All of these
genes, independent of whether they are p53 or p73 targets,
were significantly upregulated only in cells infected with
OV co-expressing HDAC1 inhibitor plus p73 (Figure 3B).
A significant increase was also observed after infection
with OV.p73 except for the p53 target Apaf-1, which is
epigenetically silenced in melanoma cells and solely
enhanced by the virus able to knock down HDAC1.
These data again support that OV.shHDAC1.p73 has the
strongest capability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells.
One of the earlier events in programmed cell death
initiation is cleavage of caspase 3 into its active form.
Monitoring by Western blot the accumulation of activated
caspase 3 in cells treated with Ad-derived vectors and
infected with OVs gave another hint for enhanced
apoptosis triggered by OV.shHDAC1.p73 (Figure 3C). No
increase in uncleaved caspase 3 was observed after virus

Anti-tumoral effect of OV.shHDAC1.p73 in vivo
To examine the oncolytic effects of viruses on
experimentally induced xenograft melanoma in vivo, we
established subcutaneous tumors from SK-Mel-147 cells
in nude mice. Upon injection, SK-Mel-147 induce very
fast growing solid tumors and the sacrification of untreated
mice becomes necessary after 2-3 weeks. Tumors were
grown to a size of 100 mm3 and subsequently injected with
three doses of 1 x 108 PFU per mouse every other day.

Luc, OV.p73, and OV.shHDAC1.p73. In mice receiving
OV.Luc, the mean tumor volume reached 648 mm3 (SD
138 mm3) 28 days after the initial treatment. These tumor
volumes were significantly higher than the mean tumor size
of 264 mm3 (SD 214 mm3) and 259 mm3 (SD 180 mm3)
in the groups that received OV.p73 or OV.shHDAC1.Luc,
respectively. Complete tumor regression was observed in
eight out of eight mice treated with OV.shHDAC1.p73
within seventeen days after treamtent was initiated. One
animal retained some fibrotic tissue along the observation
time. In mice treated with OV.shHDAC1 and OV.p73 the
tumors progressed slower or showed some regression
compared to OV.Luc. In only two mice from each of the
latter groups we experienced complete tumor regression
four weeks after the first treatment. One of the most
common drawbacks in tumor therapy with oncolytic
viruses is the recurrence of tumors, even if the immediate
effect of the virus on tumor growth is significant. Survival
of mice treated with oncolytic virus that coexpresses
shHDAC1 and active p73 was prolonged to a statistically
significant extent (C) and no signs of tumor recurrence
were observed in the OV.shHDAC1.p73 group at least for
16 weeks. Altogether, despite of the rather low amount of
virus used for treatment, OV.shHDAC1.p73 appears to be
a potent anti-tumoral agent.

the efficiency of DNA damaging agents [44]. DNA
damage-induced acetylation potentiates the apoptotic
function of p73 by enhancing its ability to selectively
activate transcription of pro-apoptotic genes [45]. Histone
deacetylase inhibitors have been shown to exhibit an
antitumoral effect in different tumor types including
melanoma, and more important, have a potential to
reverse epigenetic repression of tumor suppressor genes
[44]. Treatment of cells with HDAC inhibitors has been
reported to induce p53-independent cell cycle arrest with
little or no cytotoxicity [46] and to counteract promoter
repression by p73 [43]. In addition to the suppressive
function of HDAC1 on apoptosis signaling in cutaneous
melanoma, DNp73 isoforms that act as antagonists of
wild-type p53 and p73 [11] are highly expressed in
invasive and metastatic melanoma cells [15, 16]. Current
data clearly implicate the imbalanced p73/DNp73 ratio coresponsible for the anti-apoptotic features of skin cancer
cells [47]. Increased expression of DNp73 abrogates
the apoptotic properties of p53 or p73 and switches the
cells towards cancer progression [17, 48]. This opened
up completely new possibilities for successful therapy
of aggressive cancer phenotypes by either knocking
down DNp73 or enforced p73 expression in association
with removal of the epigenetic blockade. We tested here
a strategy aiming at concomitant expression of an RNAbased HDAC1 inhibitor and TAp73 in the context of an
oncolytic adenovirus. Gene-based virotherapy is a well
known approach for anticancer treatment where tumor
selectivity is achieved through deletion of viral genes
critical for growth in normal cells but dispensable in
tumor cells [49]. The advantage of virotherapy is that
progeny viruses released after destruction of cancer cells
do spread to neighbouring and distant cancer cells, and
ideally eliminate the entire neoplastic tissue [50]. In the
present study, we used the previously described Addelta24
harboring a 24bp deletion in the E1A gene responsible for
Rb binding [28] to replicate exclusively in cancer cells.
We demonstrated that the combination of
replication-competent Ad expressing shHDAC1 and
p73 has a superior therapeutic effect compared to OV
that solely impairs cell growth by virus replication. Our
study revealed that virus encoding HDAC1 inhibitor in
combination with p73 results in 100% cytotoxicity even
by treating cells at a much lower concentration than the
control virus. In contrast, a lesser cytotoxic effect was
seen after expressing either one alone which is somehow
surprising. A rational explanation for this observation is
that the expression of only shHDAC1 or p73 adversely
affects viral replication, as the efficacy of virus replication
within cancer cells determines its cytotoxic potential.
Accumulating evidence indicates that viruses actively
delay apoptosis of their host cells in order to prevent the
cells’ disintegration prior to replication, efficient assembly,
and progeny release. In this regard, previous studies
reported that the chemical histone acetylase inhibitor

DISCUSSION
Metastatic melanoma is a deadly cancer that fails
to respond to conventional chemotherapy [37]. The basis
for drug resistance in malignant melanoma is mainly
dysregulation of apoptosis although other mechanisms
including drug transport, detoxification, and enhanced
DNA repair may also play a role [38]. Apoptotic defects
have been described at multiple levels and in both
major death pathways. The clinical challenge today is
whether effective therapies can specifically target the
pivotal triggering events and their evolution when cancer
progresses [39].
p53 plays an important role in the execution of
programmed cell death in tumors but, though inactivated
in melanoma, gene mutations that are frequently found
in other human cancers are seldom. In more than 60% of
melanoma cell lines, p53 has lost its normal transcriptional
activities [40] and p53-dependent pro-apoptotic genes are
often underexpressed in wild-type p53-positive tumors
[41, 42]. In tumor cells, downregulation of genes often
results from the direct effect of histone deacetylation
which blocks the transcription machinery. HDAC1,
for instance, can bind to TAp73 and suppresses p73dependent transcriptional activity [43]. Growing evidence
suggests that gene expression governed by epigenetic
changes is also crucial for tumor progression and that
modulation of histone deacetylase activity may increase

valproic acid (VPA) acts as an antagonist of adenoviral
replication [51] and might be the reason for low virus
progeny production of OV.shHDAC1.Luc. Similarly,
overexpression of p73 might also result in decreasing
progeny due to apoptosis induction that impedes the
production of mature virus particles [52]. Notably, progeny
production of OV.shHDAC1.p73 was significantly higher
than that of OV.p73 and OV.shHDAC1.Luc. Earlier studies
showed that both, p73 and chemical inhibitors of HDAC1,
like suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), are capable
to induce autophagy in addition to apoptosis [53, 54]. The
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), another protein
with key functions in cell growth and proliferation, for
example, is able to regulate p73, and treatment with
rapamycin sensitizes highly aggressive breast cancer
cells to cisplatin through upregulation of TAp73 [5557]. Our results revealed that the levels of autophagy
induction measured as autophagic flux represented by
the ratio of autophagosomal microtubule-associated
protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-II) to cytosolic (LC3-I)
protein, differed considerably between the viruses used
in this study. The conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was
lower in OV.p73 and OV.shHDAC1.Luc compared
to OV.Luc infected cells. In contrast, in cells infected
with OV.shHDAC1.p73, the autophagic flux increased
substantially. Thus, our data support previous results
indicating that adenovirus-induced autophagy correlates
positively with virus replication and that autodigestion
may generate nutrients to be recycled while assembling
progeny particles [35]. Based on these observations, we
can conclude that apoptosis and autophagy are induced
more intensely in OV.shHDAC1.p73 infected than in cells
treated with the other viruses. This could be a reason for
the relatively higher progeny production of OV.shHDAC1.
p73 compared to OV.shHDAC1.Luc and OV.p73. As
previously demonstrated, an oncolytic adenovirus
overexpressing beclin-1, a central protein for autophagy
induction and regulation [58], had a significantly
enhanced cytotoxicity compared to parental OV lacking
beclin-1 in a leukemic cancer model in vitro and in vivo
[59], whereas inhibition of autophagy via chloroquine
resulted in enhanced oncolytic activity in glioblastoma
[60], indicating that cellular prerequisites might play an
important role in balancing the consequences of viral
autophagy induction. Our data therefore suggest the notion
that only the combination of HDAC1 knockdown and p73
overexpression enhances virus yield via a process in which
autophagy is crucial. From the therapeutic perspective,
a relevance of the interplay between apoptosis and
autophagy for efficient elimination of melanoma cells was
also reported by others [61].
To enhance apoptosis while oncolytic viruses
replicate in cancer cells was the major goal of our study
and indeed, the viruses we created showed substantial
differences in their capacity to induce programmed cell
death during replication. To differentiate between necrosis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and apoptotic cellular disintegration after virus treatment,
we compared cleavage of the apoptosis related proteins
caspase 3 and PARP in infected cells. The hypothesis,
that apoptosis rather than destruction of cells due to
viral replication is the hallmark of OV.shHDAC1.p73,
we compared the expression of pro-apoptotic genes
influenced by p73 and HDAC1. Results demonstrated that
the expression levels of Apaf-1, Bax, Bim, and PUMA
were increased after infection with OV.HDAC1, OV.p73,
as well as OV.shHDAC1.p73 compared to the parental
OV.Luc. The expression of the above mentioned proapoptotic genes was significantly higher in OV.shHDAC1.
p73 infected cells than in cells treated with the other
viruses. Upregulation of Apaf-1 by both shHDAC1
expressing viruses also argues for the efficient restoration
of endogenous p53-dependent pathways. This indicated
the enhanced apoptotic capabilities of the virus expressing
both, p73 and shHDAC1 while replicating efficiently.
We further confirmed the highest therapeutic
efficacy of the oncolytic virus that co-expresses HDAC1
shRNA and p73 in a mouse xenograft model by treating
aggressively growing melanomas with a low virus dose of
3 x 108 PFU separated over three consecutive injections
of 1 x 108 each. Intratumoral injection of this virus caused
complete tumor regression in all animals. The validity of
arming oncolytic viruses with either RNA-based inhibitor
of epigenetic silencing or apoptosis inducing gene was
further supported in that viruses that only express shRNA
against histone deacetylase 1 or the TP73 gene lead
to tumor regression in two or three out of eight mice,
respectively.
Altogether, the studies reported here indicate that the
combination of ectopic p73 expression with knockdown of
HDAC1 generates synergistically enhanced cytotoxicity in
metastatic melanoma cells. The defective death pathways
could be reactivated in these tumor cells by lifting
the epigenetic blockade to allow p73/p53-dependent
transcription of pro-apoptotic genes using tumor specific
replicative oncolytic virus. This study also showed that
autophagy induced by the virus expressing both effectors
plays a pivotal role for its replication. These results
emphasize the importance of pursuing different cytotoxic
strategies for the treatment of highly therapy-resistant
cancers using oncolytic viruses. At present, patients with
advanced melanoma barely profit from chemotherapeutic
regimens. The reasons for nonfunctional p53/p73
pathways in melanomas and the compromised apoptotic
response to chemotherapy include the inactivation of p53/
p73 and their pro-apoptotic target genes by deacetylation
as well as the expression of antagonistic DNp73 variants.
Releasing the apoptotic genes by knocking down HDAC1
and concomitant ectopic expression of functional p73
to change the ratio of p73/DNp73 and transactivate
readily available pro-apoptotic genes through highly
efficient gene transfer by a replicating virus could
enhance chemosensitivity. This raises the possibility that

OV.shHDAC1.p73 treatment also improves the chances
for successful therapy of metastatic melanoma through
conventional chemotherapy.

The plasmid pSuper.Retro.shHDAC1 was generated
by using the Oligoengine plasmid system and inserting an
HDAC1 specific shRNA-sequence 5’-CGCAGATGCA
GAGATTCAAC-3’ [65]. The shRNA including the H1promoter was excised from pSuper.Retro.shHDAC1
using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and BsrGI. To
generate pSdelta24.shHDAC1, the resulting fragment and
the previously MluI-linearized pSdelta24 were blunted
with Klenow enzyme and ligated. The luciferase gene
in pFiberILDE3 was replaced with p73 by cleaving the
plasmid with NcoI and XbaI. Since both restriction
enzyme recognition sites existed twice in this plasmid
it was necessary to remove the second XbaI site located
outside the region of homologous recombination by partial
digestion followed by blunting with Klenow enzyme and
re-ligation to create pFiberILDE3X. Due to its position
inside the fiber gene, the unwanted NcoI recognition site
could not be removed in the same way. Instead, a PCR
fragment was generated by using pFiberILDE3 as a
template and primers to replace the NcoI site at the 5’end of the luciferase gene with an XbaI site, pFiberNcoIFw 5’-CAAAACAAA AATTGGCCATGGC-3’ and
pFiberXbaI-Rv
5’-GCTCTAGAGTATCATCGTGTT
TTTCAAAGGAAA-3’. Ligation of this NcoI/XbaIdigested PCR product with an equally digested
pFiberILDE3X resulted in the plasmid pFiberDE3
retaining a unique XbaI restriction enzyme recognition
site. The plasmid pcDNA.p73 [38] served as a PCR
template to attach XbaI restriction sites at both ends of the
p73 gene using primers p73-XbaI-Fw 5’-GCTCTAGAA
TGGCCCAGTCCACCGCCAC-3’ and p73-XbaI-Rv
5’-GCTCTAGATCAGGGCCCC CAGGCTCTGAC-3’.
After digestion with XbaI, the PCR fragment was
introduced into the linearized pFiberDE3 to generate
pFiber.p73DE3. All plasmids were validated by PCR,
restriction digestion, or sequencing.
The replication deficient adenoviral vectors
Ad.Empty, Ad.shGFP, and Ad.p73 have been described
previously [66]. Oncolytic viruses were produced by
transfecting A549 cells with PacI-digested recombined
plasmids using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The viruses were validated by
Western blotting, subsequently enriched in A549 cells,
and finally purified by two rounds of CsCl equilibrium
density gradient ultracentrifugation. Physical particle
concentration was determined by OD260 measurement
(viral particles/ml) and infectious particle concentration by
a standard TCID50 assay on HEK293 cells (plaque forming
units/ml). Titers of Ad.Empty, Ad.shGFP and Ad.p73 were
2.8x1010 PFU/ml, 4.5x1010 PFU/ml and 8.9x109 PFU/ml,
respectively. Oncolytic viruses OV.Luc, OV.shHDAC1.
Luc, OV.p73 and OV.shHDAC1.p73 had a titer of 6.3x109
PFU/ml, 1.6x109 PFU/ml, 1.0x109 PFU/ml and 8.9x109
PFU/ml, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and culture
HEK293, A549, H1299, SK-Mel-147, and SKMel-103 cell lines were cultured in DMEM with sodium
pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA), and 10% fetal calf
serum (Biochrome) with 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml
streptomycin, and 1.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (PAA) in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Plasmids and viruses
The plasmids modified in this study for producing
oncolytic adenoviruses have been described previously
[62, 63]. They comprise pVK500 which bears the
adenovirus serotype 5 genome, as well as the shuttle
plasmids pSdelta24 that contributes the E1A gene
lacking the nucleotides 923–946 that encode the amino
acid stretch LTCHEAGF of E1A [31], and pFiberILDE.
The plasmids were used for two subsequent steps of
homologous recombination carried out in BJ5183
bacteria (Stratagene) as described [64]. First, pVK500
was recombined with PmeI-linearized pSdelta24 or
pSdelta24.shHDAC1 to produce pVK500.Sdelta24 and
pVK500.Sdelta24.shHDAC1, respectively. The altered
plasmids were linearized with SwaI and subjected to a
second homologous recombination with PmeI-linearized
pFiberILDE3 or pFiber.p73DE3 to generate pOV.Luc,
pOV.shHDAC1.Luc, pOV.p73, and pOV.shHDAC1.
p73, respectively. For a schematic representation of
the generated oncolytic viruses see Figure 1. Plasmid
pSdelta24 was used to introduce E1Adelta24 into the E1region of the adenoviral genome. Its descendant pSdelta24.
shHDAC1 was created by using the previously described
newly introduced MluI/SalI restriction sites between
the E4 genes and the right terminal repeat (between
nucleotides 35,774 and 35,775 of the Ad5 genome) of
pSdelta24 [63]. This allows the additional insertion of an
shRNA against HDAC1 under control of the human H1promoter into the E4-region, without disrupting the viral
replication capacity [64].The plasmid pFiberILDE3 and
its descendant pFiberp73DE3 were used to either insert
the luciferase or the p73 gene, respectively, into the fiber
region of the virus genome. These groups of genes are
then expressed bicistronically together with the fiber gene
by means of an enhanced IRES sequence. Moreover, both
fiber-plasmids contain the pAdEasyI E3-deletion, which
was transferred together with luciferase or p73 into the
adenoviral genome by homologous recombination.

Quantification was performed using iQTM SYBR Green
Supermix with the iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR
Detection System (Bio-Rad). Relative gene expression
was calculated with the comparative Ct method using
GAPDH for normalization.
To quantitiate gene expression by qRT-PCR, RNA
was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and
subsequently reverse transcribed with the Omniscript
RT Kit (Qiagen). cDNA samples were mixed with iQTM
SYBR Green Supermix and analyzed as described above
for the quantification of viral DNA. Primers used for
Apaf-1 were: Fw 5’-AACCAGGA TGGGTCACCA-3’
and Rv 5’-ACTGAAA CCCAATGCACTCC-3’, for
Bax: Fw 5’-CACCAGCTCTG AGCAGATCAT-3’ and
Rv 5’-GCGGCAATC ATCCTCTGCAG-3’, for Bim:

PUMA: Fw 5’-GAAGAGCAAATGAGC CAAACG-3’
and Rv 5’-GGAGC AACCGGCAAACG-3’, respectively.

Cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer
(50mM Tris-Cl, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Total protein concentration was
quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and equal amounts
of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to
nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences).
Samples were probed with antibodies against p73 and
PARP (both BD Bioscience), cleaved Caspase 3, HDAC1,
LC3A/B (Cell Signaling), uncleaved Caspase 3 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), Atg3 (Cell Signaling), Beclin-1
(Cell Signaling), and actin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies
against mouse or rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling) were used for
signal detection.
For immunofluorescence SK-Mel-147 cells were
grown on coverslips and infected with OVs. At 48 h after
virus infection cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized, and stained with anti-Beclin 1 [EPR1733Y]
(Abcam) or Atg3 antibody (Cell Signaling). A secondary
anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor488 (Molecular
Probes) was used for visualization with a laser-scanning
microscope. Cell nuclei were stained with 406-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) (5 mg/ml) (Molecular Probes).

Living cells determination by trypan blue
exclusion or crystal violet staining

Burst assay

The cytopathic effect within the first 48 hours after
infection was determined by trypan blue exclusion cell
counting. Cells (2 x 106) were plated in 6-well plates and
either mock treated or infected with virus at MOI 10 in
1.5 ml culture medium. After 24, 36, and 48 hours cells
were trypsinized and resuspended in 500 µl PBS. Cells
were then mixed with 500 µl trypan blue solution (Sigma)
and subjected to cell count to determine the percentages
of living cells. The cytopathic effect of the viruses at low
MOI was measured by crystal violet staining. Cells (1
x 104) were seeded in 48-well plates and 24 hours later
either mock treated or infected with MOI 1, 0.1, or 0.01
in 0.2 ml DMEM containing 2% fetal calf serum. After 2
hours, DMEM was replaced and the cells were maintained
in fresh DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum for seven days.
Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained
for 45 min with 1% crystal violet in 70% ethanol followed
by washing with H2O to remove excess color. After drying,
the plates were photographed.

To quantify virus progeny production, 2 x 104 cells
were plated in 24-well plates and infected at MOI 1 in
250 µl growth medium. Two hours post-infection the
medium was removed and cells were washed twice with
PBS to remove unbound viruses. Then 500 µl of growth
medium were added and 24, 36, 48, or 72 hours later the
cells and supernatants were harvested. The viruses were
released from cells through three cycles of freezing in
liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37°C. Infectious virus
particles were determined as plaque forming units (PFU)
by the tissue culture infective method (TCID50) assay on
HEK293 cells.

Quantitative real-time PCR
To quantify viral DNA by qRT-PCR, 2 x 106 cells
were seeded onto 6-well plates and either mock treated
or infected with viruses at MOI 10. After two min, 24
hours, and 48 hours cells were washed twice with PBS,
trypsinized and finally resuspended in PBS. Genomic
DNA was isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit with an additional RNase A treatment. 50 ng
of genomic DNA were then used to quantify virus DNA
content in relation to cellular GAPDH. The respective
primers E2B-Fw 5’-GGCATCT CGATCCAGCATATC3’
and E2B-Rv 5’-CCGTGGAAAGACATGACCCT-3’
were published previously [26], as well as GADPHwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Hoechst 33342 staining and FACS analysis
In situ cytopathic effects after virus infections were
visualized by Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) staining. Cells
(2 x 106) were seeded in 6-well plates and either mock
treated or infected at MOI 2 with virus in 1.5 ml culture
medium. After 24 hours, cells were stained by adding
Hoechst 33342 at 1 µg/ml to the culture medium. After
20 min of incubation at 37°C cells were analyzed by

Athymic male NMRI nu/nu mice at the age of 6 to
8 weeks were subcutaneously injected into the right flank
with 5 x 106 SK-Mel-147 tumor cells. Tumor volumes
were monitored using calipers according to the formula
V = 4π/3 × (b/2)2 × (a/2) (with a = length and b = width).
Once the tumors had reached a mass of 100 mm3 usually
ten to 14 days after inoculation, the mice were treated with
oncolytic viruses by direct injections into the tumor. A total
of three injections (each 1 x 108 PFU) were administered
every other day. Tumor volume developments were
monitored daily and their volumes determined according
to the above formula. Animals were sacrificed when tumor
sizes exceeded 800 mm3. All experiments were performed
in accordance with guidelines set by the University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were
approved by the local government.
