ABSTRACT
Polypharmacology (the ability of a drug to affect more than one molecular
target) is considered a basic property of many therapeutic small molecules. Herein,
we used a chemical genomics approach to systematically analyze polypharmacology
by integrating several analytical tools, including the LINCS (Library of Integrated
Cellular Signatures), STITCH (Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals), and
WebGestalt (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit). We applied this approach to
identify functional disparities between two cytidine nucleoside analogs: azacytidine
(AZA) and decitabine (DAC). AZA and DAC are structurally and mechanistically similar
DNA-hypomethylating agents. However, their metabolism and destinations in cells are
distinct. Due to their differential incorporation into RNA or DNA, functional disparities
between AZA and DAC are expected. Indeed, different cytotoxicities of AZA and
DAC toward human colorectal cancer cell lines were observed, in which cells were
more sensitive to AZA. Based on a polypharmacological analysis, we found that AZA
transiently blocked protein synthesis and induced an acute apoptotic response that
was antagonized by concurrently induced cytoprotective autophagy. In contrast, DAC
caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase associated with p53 induction. Therefore,
our study discriminated functional disparities between AZA and DAC, and also
demonstrated the value of this chemical genomics approach that can be applied to
discover novel drug action mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

cells and affect their phenotypes on a global scale [3].
Utilization and integration of these resources can build
a systematic view of a drug’s actions. For example,
our previous study successfully identified novel action
mechanisms of the Chinese herbal medicine, berberine,
using a gene expression signature-based approach [4]. This
approach integrates the Connectivity MAP (CMAP) that
collects gene-expression profiles from cultured human cells
treated with small molecules [5], and the Search Tool for
Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) that explores known
and predicted interactions of chemicals and proteins by
evidence derived from experiments, databases, and the

Many therapeutic drugs generally exhibit actions on
more than one molecular target, which is a phenomenon
known as polypharmacology [1]. Predicting the
polypharmacology of clinically used drugs or compounds
that failed during development is highly useful for finding
new indications (drug repurposing or repositioning) and
discovering novel drug action mechanisms to improve
their therapeutic efficacies [2]. Increasingly, large-scale
databases are being established to explain how drugs
induce changes in gene and protein expressions in human

literatures [6]. More and more biomedical databases and
analytical tools have been developed in recent years, which
provide easy and open access to masses of accumulated
data [3]. Integration of these resources will be highly useful
in the field of polypharmacology.
DNA methylation is one of the most widely
studied epigenetic changes, which is catalyzed by DNA
methyltransferases (DNMTs). Two DNMT inhibitors,
5-azacytidine (azacitidine, AZA) and 2′-deoxy-5-azacytidine
(decitabine, DAC) were approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for treating myelodysplastic syndrome and
other leukemias [7]. Both drugs are cytidine analogs that
are incorporated into DNA to bind and inhibit DNMTs, thus
preventing maintenance of the methylation status. Unlike
DAC, which is directly incorporated into DNA, AZA is
primarily incorporated into RNA. Only when its diphosphate
form is reduced to deoxy-diphosphates by ribonucleoside
reductase can AZA then be incorporated into DNA to deplete
DNMTs [8–10]. Actually, AZA was reported to more often
be incorporated into RNA than DNA [9, 10]. Therefore, AZA
may possess RNA-dependent effects. Indeed, ribonucleotide
reductase M2 (RRM2), a subunit of ribonucleotide
reductase, was identified as a novel molecular target of AZA
in acute myeloid leukemia [11]. The inhibition of RRM2
expression by AZA involves its direct RNA incorporation
and attenuated RRM2 messenger (m)RNA stability [11].
Thus, AZA and DAC should be viewed as distinct types of
DNMT inhibitors, and a greater understanding of their action
mechanisms will provide further clinical benefits.
In this study, we used an integrated chemical
genomics approach to investigate functional disparities
between AZA and DAC. This approach integrated the
Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) [12]
which is the next generation of CMAP, together with two
analytical tools, the STITCH and the WEB-based GEne
SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt). Polypharmacological
analyses of AZA and DAC displayed functional disparities
that were further demonstrated by proof-of-concept studies
which showed that AZA transiently blocked protein
synthesis and reduced protein stability, while DAC induced
cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase that was associated with
p53 expression. Further investigation showed that AZA
simultaneously induced an acute apoptotic response and
cytoprotective autophagy in a mutually exclusive manner.
Our results provide an example of applying several
existing bioinformatics tools for systematic discovery of
polypharmacology.

database that collects gene-expression profiles from cultured
human cells treated with small molecules, can be used to
find connections among small molecules that share common
action mechanisms [5]. The LINCS is the next generation
of CMAP, which generates gene expression signatures
including pharmacological or genetic perturbations applied
to mostly cancer cell lines using the L1000 platform
[13]. The L1000 assay is an mRNA expression profiling
technique based on reduced representation of the genome
whereby 1000 carefully selected transcripts are monitored,
and from which the remainder of the transcriptome can be
computationally inferred [13]. Compared to CMAP, the
LINCS contains gene expression profiles of small molecules
and also those of genetic constructs for knocking-down
genes (short hairpin (sh)RNA) or overexpressing genes
(complementary (c)DNA). The LINCS has greater numbers
of gene expression signatures (perturbagens) and cell lines
than CMAP, thus providing more-reliable predictions.
In addition, the LINCS can be more easily accessed
through a web-based interface at http://www.lincscloud.
org/. Therefore, we proposed that the LINCS provides an
opportunity for a comprehensive systematic analysis of
polypharmacology.
Herein, we describe the workflow of a
polypharmacology analysis that integrated the LINCS with
other online bioinformatics tools (Figure 1). First, we queried
the LINCS database (http://www.lincscloud.org/) for “your
drug of interest” using the “Compound Digest” algorithm.
We obtained output results for “Compound Connections”,
“Consensus Knockdown Connections”, and “Overexpression
Connections”. The “Compound Connections” section
contained a number of compounds similar to “your drug of
interest”. The “Consensus Knockdown Connections” and
“Overexpression Connections” sections indicated that the
outcomes of knockdown or overexpression of genes were
similar to the effects of “your drug of interest”. Second,
compounds with strongly positive connectivity scores in
“Compound Connections” were further filtered using the
STITCH database (http://stitch.embl.de/) to explore their
chemical-chemical connectivities [6]. Then, compounds
directly connected to “your drug of interest” were
obtained. Third, gene profiles of “Consensus Knockdown
Connections” and “Overexpression Connections” were
analyzed using WebGestalt (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.
edu/webgestalt/) [14] to enrich Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Therefore, the
polypharmacology of “your drug of interest” was obtained
from results of the STITCH and WebGestalt analyses. By
comparing results of the STITCH and WebGestalt analyses,
we obtained possible targets or functions regulated by “your
drug of interest” for further validation.

two DNMT inhibitors, AZA and DAC, were performed
and used as examples. Despite the similarity of AZA
and DAC, which both closely resemble the structure
of cytidine, their metabolism and destinations in cells
were distinct (Figure 2A). DAC is phosphorylated by
deoxycytidine kinase into triphosphate, which can be
incorporated into newly synthesized DNA. In contrast,
AZA is primarily phosphorylated by uridine-cytidine
kinase into triphosphates, which are ultimately incorporated
into RNA. However, the diphosphate forms of AZA can
also be reduced by ribonucleoside reductase into deoxy-

diphosphates, which can be incorporated into DNA. It was
reported that incorporation of AZA into RNA is greater than
that into DNA [9, 10]. Therefore, AZA may possess RNAdependent effects. Indeed, differential responses of AZA
and DAC toward various types of cancers were observed
[15–19]. In this study, we also observed that human CRC
HCT116 cells were more sensitive to AZA than to DAC
according to an MTT cell viability assay (Figure 2B, upper
part; IC50 values shown in Table 1). To investigate whether
the differential effects of AZA and DAC result from their
ability to degrade DNMTs, a Western blot analysis of

DNMT1 was performed. As shown in Figure 2B (lower
part), DNMT1 was depleted in response to both AZA and
DAC, suggesting that other mechanisms in addition to
DNMT1 inhibition are involved in their differential effects.
To investigate whether this phenomenon is common in
human CRC cells, several cell lines (RKO, LoVo, HCT-15,
DLD-1, and HT-29) were treated with AZA or DAC for 3
days, and then cell viabilities were analyzed by an MTT
assay. Consistently, these cell lines were more sensitive to
AZA treatment (Figure 2C). Therefore, we propose that
AZA and DAC are suitable examples to evaluate whether
our approach can discriminate their functional disparities.

that knockdown and overexpression of genes with strong
positive scores have similar gene expression signatures to
AZA or DAC. Analyzing these genes may reveal action
mechanisms of AZA and DAC. Therefore, enrichment of
KEGG pathways was evaluated using the WebGestalt [14].
Due to limited genes with a score of > 60 in “Overexpression
Connections” gene sets of AZA and DAC (Supplementary
Table  S2), only “Consensus Knockdown Connections”
gene sets were analyzed. As shown in Table 2, “aminoacyltRNA biosynthesis” and “metabolic pathways” were
enriched in the “Consensus Knockdown Connections”
gene set of AZA. While in the “Consensus Knockdown
Connections” gene set of DAC, numerous pathways were
enriched, including “pathways in cancer”, “cell cycle”,
“p53 signaling pathway”, “metabolic pathways”, “T cell
receptor signaling pathway”, “epithelial cell signaling in
Helicobacter pylori infection”, “neurotrophin signaling
pathway”, “Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis)”,
and “osteoclast differentiation”. Consistent with results of
the STITCH analysis, AZA and DAC showed functional
disparities in regulating biological pathways. Results of the
STITCH and WebGestalt analyses were comparable because
aminoacyl-tRNAs are substrates for protein translation [14],
and AZA might disrupt aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and
inhibit protein synthesis. Although DAC did not show direct
connections to other compounds in the STITCH analysis,
a pathway enrichment analysis indicated that DAC might
affect cell cycle progression and the p53 signaling pathway
(Table 2). In addition, the most similar compound to DAC
was danusertib (Supplementary Table S1) which was
formerly known as PHA-739358 and acts as a pan-Aurora
kinase inhibitor [20]. Aurora kinases consist of a family of
serine/threonine kinases that play important roles in cell
cycle progression, particularly during the G2 and M phases
[21]. Danusertib was found to arrest cancer cells at the G2/M
phase involving the p53 signal pathway [22]. Therefore, we
propose that DAC may alter the phenotype of cells similar
to that by danusertib.

Chemical genomics analysis reveals functional
disparities between AZA and DAC
Herein, we analyzed the polypharmacology of
AZA and DAC by our chemical genomics workflow
(Figure 1). First, we queried the LINCS database for
AZA (input “azacitidine”) or DAC (input “decitabine”)
using the “Compound Digest” algorithm. We obtained the
output results of “Compound Connections”, “Consensus
Knockdown Connections”, and “Overexpression
Connections”. The top 100 compounds with positive scores
in “Compound Connections” are shown in Supplementary
Table S1, representing the most similar drugs to AZA or
DAC. These drugs were further queried using the STITCH
database to explore their chemical-chemical connectivities
[6]. As shown in Figure 3A, the STITCH analysis indicated
that AZA is directly connected to emetine and cycloheximide
(CHX), and indirectly to puromycin. These drugs belong to
protein synthesis inhibitors (Figure 3B). In contrast, DAC
did not have direct connections to other compounds (data
not shown). Therefore, these results suggest that AZA and
DAC indeed show functional disparities, and AZA might
interfere with protein synthesis.

translation through its covalent incorporation into the C
terminus of nascent polypeptide chains [24]. Puromycinincorporated neosynthesized proteins can be detected by
an anti-puromycin antibody [23]. To investigate the effects
of AZA and DAC on protein synthesis, HCT116 cells were
treated with AZA or DAC for 6 and 24 h, or with CHX,
a protein synthesis inhibitor, which was used as a positive
control. Puromycin was added to cells 30 min before cells
were harvested. Whole-cell lysates were separated using
SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane. Proteins were
visualized using ponceau S staining (Figure 4A, upper

Based on results of the chemical genomics analyses,
we hypothesized that AZA disrupts aminoacyl-tRNA
biosynthesis and then inhibits protein synthesis, while
DAC perturbs cell cycle progression that may involve the
p53 signaling pathway. To demonstrate this hypothesis,
we first analyzed protein synthesis by a puromycinincorporation assay [23]. As a Tyr-tRNA mimetic,
puromycin enters the ribosome A site and terminates

part). After hybridization with an anti-puromycin antibody,
we found that AZA, like CHX, inhibited puromycin
incorporation at 6 h; however, DAC enhanced puromycin
incorporation at the same time (Figure 4A, lower part).
Interestingly, the effects of AZA and DAC had recovered at
24 h, indicating that alterations of protein synthesis by AZA
and DAC were transient. Because perturbation of protein
synthesis will affect protein stability, we further examined
the effects of AZA, DAC, and CHX on protein stability
by treating HCT116 and RKO cells with these drugs for
1~4 h. We chose the c-MYC protein as an indicator because
of its short half-life, usually 20~30 min [25]. As shown in
Figure 4B, both AZA and CHX reduced the protein stability
of c-MYC in HCT116 and RKO cells. In contrast, DAC
increased the stability of c-MYC.

We also examined the effects of AZA and DAC
on cell cycle progression and the p53 signaling pathway
according to the above prediction. To investigate whether
AZA or DAC affected cell cycle progression, HCT116 cells
were treated with 25 and 50 μM AZA or DAC for 24 and
48 h, and then cell cycle distributions were analyzed by flow
cytometry. Consistent with results of pathway enrichment,
DAC induced G2/M arrest at 24 h, which had been relieved
by 48 h (Figure 5A). In contrast, AZA increased the subG1
population at both 24 and 48 h, suggesting the induction of
apoptosis (Figure 5A). To investigate the effects of AZA
and DAC on the p53 signaling pathway, protein expressions
of p53 and p53R2, a p53 target gene that causes G2/M arrest
and is directly involved in the p53 checkpoint for DNA
repair [26], were analyzed by a Western blot analysis. As

AZA induces an acute apoptotic response that is
antagonized by concurrent autophagy

shown in Figure 5B, DAC induced greater expressions
of p53 and p53R2 compared to AZA. In addition, AZA,
but not DAC, induced DNA damage as indicated by the
phosphorylation of H2AX (γH2AX), indicating that DACinduced p53R2 might be responsible for the repair of DNA
damage. Taken together, these proof-of-concept studies
confirmed our chemical genomics approach.

Induction of apoptosis by AZA might explain the
differential effects of AZA and DAC on cell viability.
Therefore, we further characterized AZA-induced apoptosis
by a caspase-3/7 activity assay. In addition, cellular plasma

membrane permeabilization was determined by staining
of dead cells with the dye, 7-AAD. As shown in Figure 6,
only AZA induced obvious activation of caspase-3/7 at 24
and 48 h. Treatment with 0.5 μM doxorubicin was used
as a positive control for caspase-3/7 activation (Figure 6).
Interestingly, we found that kinetic changes of AZA (50 μM)
and doxorubicin (0.5 μM) on caspase activation differed,
although their inhibitory effects on cell viability were
similar (Figures 2C, 7A). The percentages of apoptotic,
apoptotic/dead, and dead cells induced by doxorubicin
(0.5 μM) at 24 h were 24%, 23.56% and 1.39%, respectively.
At 48 h, the reduced apoptotic cell (1.9%) population was
correlated with the induction of apoptotic/dead (40.95%)

and dead (12.55%) cell populations (Figure 6), representing
a shift from early to late apoptotic responses. However,
AZA (50 μM) induced 8.2% of apoptotic, 17.64% of
apoptotic/dead, and 3.13% of dead cells at 24 h, but 6.6%
of apoptotic, 16.7% of apoptotic/dead, and 20.6% of dead
cells at 48 h (Figure 6), indicating that the ability of AZA
to induce apoptosis was limited as observed in a cell cycle
analysis showing similar subG1 populations (18.1% and
19.1%, respectively) at 24 and 48 h (Figure 5A). Because
poly(ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a well-known
cellular substrate of caspase-3/7 [27], the effects of AZA,
DAC, and doxorubicin on PARP1 cleavage were examined
by Western blot analyses. As shown in Figure 7B, AZA,

but not DAC or doxorubicin, induced obvious cleavage of
PARP1 after 24 h of treatment. Interestingly, the cleaved
form of PARP1 declined without a concomitant recovery
of the pro-form in response to 48 h of AZA treatment,
suggesting that AZA-induced apoptosis might have been
retarded. Consistent with results of caspase-3/7 staining
(Figure 6), doxorubicin induced significant PARP1 cleavage
at 48 h (Figure 7B). Therefore, these results suggest that
AZA induced an unusual and acute apoptotic response
compared to doxorubicin at an equivalent dose level which
inhibited cell viability.
Autophagy is a physiological process that regulates
the turnover of proteins and intracellular organelles.
Through self-digestion, it provides an alternative energy
source and serves as a temporary survival mechanism
during starvation [28]. In addition, autophagy can be a
stress adaptive method that avoids cell death in several
scenarios, and it can also act as an antagonist to block
apoptosis by promoting cell survival [29, 30]. Because
of the inhibitory effect of AZA on protein synthesis, we
hypothesized that AZA might simultaneously induce
autophagy and apoptosis in a mutually exclusive manner.
To investigate whether AZA induces autophagy in
HCT116 cells, a Western blot analysis was performed to
detect autophagy by the conversion of cytosolic LC3B-I
(autophagy-inactive) to processed LC3B-II (autophagyactive) [31]. Indeed, AZA, but not DAC or doxorubicin,
induced the conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II at both 24
and 48 h (Figure 7B). To investigate the role of autophagy
in AZA-induced apoptosis, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an
autophagy inhibitor, was used. 3-MA is a class III PI3K
inhibitor that blocks autophagosome formation in the
early stage of autophagy [31]. As shown in Figure 7C,
3-MA blocked the conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II as
indicated by an increase in LC3B-I, and concurrently
enhanced AZA-induced PARP1 cleavage. In contrast,
the caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, inhibited AZAinduced PARP1 cleavage as indicated by an increase in
the pro-form of PARP1, but enhanced AZA-induced
LC3B-II accumulation (Figure 7C). To confirm the role
of autophagy in the cytotoxicity of AZA, autophagydeficient ATG7-knockout (ATG-KO) DLD-1 cells were
used. As shown in Figure 7D, ATG7-KO DLD-1 cells
were more sensitive to treatment with AZA. Therefore,
AZA simultaneously induces apoptosis and cytoprotective
autophagy in a mutually exclusive manner.

recent years, which provide easy and open access to the
masses of accumulated data [3]. Integrating these resources
would be highly useful in the field of polypharmacology.
In this study, we demonstrated the value of an integrated
chemical genomics approach that can be applied for drug
repurposing and also for the discovery of novel mechanisms
of unknown drugs.
Although AZA and DAC have been clinically
used for more than half a century, and despite decades of
research to define their mechanisms, little is known about
their precise mechanisms of action [32]. In addition, despite
being viewed as structurally and mechanistically similar
drugs, AZA and DAC have different metabolism and
destinations in cells, further increasing the complexity for
delineating these two drugs. In this study, we proposed a
workflow for an integrated chemical genomics approach,
which indeed suggested functional disparities between
AZA and DAC, because similar compounds and genes
associated with AZA or DAC greatly differed, and AZA
and DAC showed little similarity to each other. This is
consistent with the highly distinct differences observed in
microarray gene expression and proteomic profiles of AZA
and DAC in cancer cells [15–18]. On further analyses of
chemical and genetic profiles of AZA and DAC, we found
that AZA inhibited protein synthesis and reduced protein
stability, and then induced an acute apoptotic response and
cytoprotective autophagy in a mutually exclusive manner. In
contrast, DAC affected cell cycle progression and induced
expressions of p53 and its target gene, p53R2. Therefore,
these proof-of-concept studies indeed demonstrated the
value of this systematic polypharmacological approach.
AZA and DAC are viewed as hypomethylating
agents because they were shown to inhibit DNA
methylation [33], which seems to be relevant to their
clinical benefits [32]. However, their hypomethylating
activity is lost and is replaced by direct cytotoxicity when
higher concentrations are given [17], which is consistent
with their original purposes of being developed as classical
cytostatic agents [34]. In this study, differential effects
of AZA and DAC were observed at doses of > 10 μM,
suggesting that DNA-hypomethylating activities might be
not associated with their functional disparities. However,
it still cannot explain why the direct cytotoxicity of AZA
and DAC toward cancer cells differed. Because 100% of
DAC is incorporated into DNA, whereas 80%~90% of
AZA is incorporated into RNA and only 10%~20% of it
into DNA [10], RNA-dependent effects of AZA might
have higher cytotoxicity than DNA-dependent effects of
DAC. Incorporation of AZA into newly synthesized RNA
(including ribosomal (r)RNAs, transfer (t)RNAs, mRNAs,
and microRNAs) might interfere with their biogenesis
and thus inhibit protein synthesis. Indeed, our results
showed that the primary pathway influenced by AZA was
aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and AZA was able to inhibit
protein synthesis and stability. Incorporation of DAC into
newly synthesized DNA might affect DNA replication

DISCUSSION
It is now commonly accepted that polypharmacology
(drug molecules that interact with multiple targets) is a basic
property of small molecules, which is also an important
basis for drug repurposing [2]. Therefore, investigating the
polypharmacologic mechanisms of drugs would be very
helpful for drug discovery. More and more biomedical
databases and analytical tools have been developed in

that could cause arrest of the cell cycle and activation of
the p53 signaling pathway to repair DNA damage [35].
Pathway enrichment of DAC-associated genes showed the
involvement of cell cycle regulation and the p53 signaling
pathway. In addition, DAC induced G2/M arrest and
expressions of p53 and p53R2. p53R2 is a p53 target gene
that causes G2/M arrest, and it is directly involved in the
p53 checkpoint for repairing DNA damage and preventing
cell death [26]. Therefore, unlike DAC, AZA did not
induce p53 or p53R2 expression, and thus AZA-induced
DNA damage could not be repaired.
In recent years, increasing numbers of studies
have been conducted to investigate the RNA-dependent
effects of AZA, and some specific molecular targets were
identified. For example, RRM2, a subunit of ribonucleotide
reductase, was identified as a novel molecular target of
AZA in acute myeloid leukemia. The inhibition of RRM2
expression by AZA involves its direct RNA incorporation
and an attenuation of RRM2 mRNA stability [11]. Because
a reduction in the diphosphate form of AZA into deoxy-

diphosphates by ribonucleotide reductase is required for
the incorporation of AZA into RNA, inhibition of RRM2
can explain the small DNA-incorporating ratio of AZA.
In addition, AZA was shown to inhibit tRNA methylation
at DNMT2 target sites [36]. DNMT2 is a tRNA-specific
methyltransferase with three verified tRNA targets:
Asp-tRNA, Gly-tRNA, and Val-tRNA [37, 38]. It is of
interest to note that the major pathway enriched in AZAassociated genes was aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and
tRNA methylation by Dnmt2 promotes tRNA stability and
protein synthesis in mice [39]. Therefore, we proposed
that AZA treatment demethylated and destabilized tRNA,
thus inhibiting protein synthesis.
Our results demonstrated that AZA induced an acute
apoptotic response that had distinct kinetics compared to
a chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin. According to this
study, aminoacyl-tRNA might be the primary target of
AZA. Disruption of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis might
be associated with AZA-induced apoptosis. One of the
major apoptosis pathways that exists in mammalian cells

is the mitochondrial pathway [40]. This pathway is defined
by the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the
cytosol where it binds to Apaf-1 and ATP/dATP, which then
assembles into an oligomeric apoptosome complex. The
apoptosome then recruits and oligomerizes the precursor of
an initiator caspase, caspase-9, leading to its autoproteolytic
activation. Caspase-9 activates effector caspases such as
caspases-3 and -7, which cleave various cellular proteins,
leading to cell death [40]. Interestingly, tRNA was shown
to bind to cytochrome c, preventing its interaction with
Apaf-1, thus blocking Apaf-1 oligomerization and caspase
activation [41]. AZA might destabilize tRNA and then
induce an acute apoptotic response in cancer cells, which
warrants further investigation in the future.
In conclusion, we report how an integrative gene
expression-based chemical genomics approach can
be useful for identifying polypharmacological action
mechanisms of a drug. Our results may provide novel
molecular insights into the anticancer mechanisms of AZA.

“Score-best6” signifies the mean connectivity score across
the six cell lines in which the pertubagen connected most
strongly to the query. “ncell” signifies the number of cell
lines over which the connectivity between the query and
the perturbagen are summarized. “nsig” signifies the
total number of perturbagen signatures over which its
connectivity to the query is summarized. In this study,
compounds with a Score-best6 of > 90 and genes with a
rank of < 100 and/or a Score-best6 of > 60 were considered
for further analyses.

Search tool for interactions of chemicals
(STITCH) analysis
LINCS compounds similar to AZA or DAC (with
a Score-best6 of > 90) were queried with STITCH 4.0
(http://stitch.embl.de/) [6]. Compounds that are present
in the STITCH database are described in Supplementary
File S1. Different nominations between the LINCS and
STITCH were carefully checked and manually edited. The
organism in STITCH was set to “Homo sapiens”. To focus
on compound connections and exclude the disturbance
of proteins, the parameters were set as follows: Active
prediction methods = Predictions; Required confidence
(score) = medium confidence (0.400); and Interaction
shown: no more than 0 interactors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Library of integrated cellular signatures
(LINCS) analysis
Data of the LINCS were generated by L1000
technology that only measures 1000 genes in each
experiment, and the remaining about 22,000 genes are
estimated by a model built from computational processing
of thousands of gene expression datasets from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) [13, 42, 43]. The LINCS has
approximately one million gene expression profiles from
22,412 unique perturbations applied to 56 different human
primary and cancer cell lines [43]. It not only provides
chemical perturbations, but also genetic perturbations
(knockdown and overexpression of a single gene). The
LINCS can be queried by an input of the user’s own upand downregulated gene lists (gene symbol or Affymetrix
U133A probe ID), or by using the “Compound Digest”
or “Gene Digest” algorithm to search established drugs
or genes. Outputs are lists of matching experiments in
three tables of “Compound Connections”, “Consensus
Knockdown
Connections”
and
“Overexpression
Connections”.
In this study, connections of AZA or DAC to other
compounds or genes were directly obtained from the LINCS
database (http://www.lincscloud.org/) using the “Compound
Digest” algorithm. The output of results included
“Compound Connections”, “Consensus Knockdown
Connections”, and “Overexpression Connections”,
representing the mostly similar (with positive scores) or
dissimilar (with negative scores) compounds or genes,
when they are knocked down or overexpressed, to AZA
or DAC. The top 100 compounds with positive scores in
“Compound Connections” are described in Supplementary
Table S1, and the top 100 genes with positive scores in the
“Consensus Knockdown Connections” and “Overexpression

Pathway enrichment analysis by the WEB-based
GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt)
Genes with a rank of < 100 and/or a Score-best6
of > 60 (Supplementary Table S2) were selected for a
pathway enrichment analysis using the WebGestalt (http://
bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/) [14]. Because of
limited genes in “Overexpression Connections” of AZA
and DAC, only genes in the “Consensus Knockdown
Connections” of AZA and DAC were considered for the
WebGestalt analysis. Parameters were set as follows:
Enrichment Analysis = KEGG Analysis; Select Reference
Set for Enrichment Analysis = hsapiens_genome; Statistical
Method = Hypergeometric; Multiple Test Adjustment = BH;
Significance Level = 0.01; and Minimum Number of Genes
for a Category = 5.

apoptosis

Human colon cancer cells (HCT116, LoVo, RKO,
HCT-15, DLD-1, and HT-29) were kindly provided by Prof.
Ya-Wen Cheng (Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan).
ATG7-wildtype (ATG7-WT) and ATG7-knockout (ATG7KO) DLD-1 cells were purchased from Horizon Discovery
(Cambridge, UK). These cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium

then treated with complete medium containing drugs for
24 and 48 h. Floating and adherent cells were harvested.
For the cell cycle analysis, cells were immediately fixed
with 75% ethanol and stored at −20°C. Cells were stained
in staining buffer (10 μg/mL PI and 100 μg/mL RNase A)
for 30 min and then analyzed on a Muse Cell Analyzer
(Merck Millipore). For apoptosis determination, cells
were stained with a Muse Caspase 3/7 Assay Kit (Merck
Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with drugs.
After 72 h of incubation, 0.5 mg/mL of MTT was added to
each well for an additional 4 h. The blue MTT formazan
precipitate was then dissolved in 200 μL of DMSO. The
absorbance at 550 nm was measured on a multiwell plate
reader. IC50 values of AZA and DAC were calculated by
SigmaPlot software using a standard curve analysis.

Statistical analysis
Means and standard deviations of samples were
