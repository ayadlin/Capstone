In this Letter, we reported that Hmga2 promotes lung cancer progression in mouse and
human cells by operating as a competing endogenous RNA for the let-7 microRNA family.
It has been brought to our attention that the cell lines used in the RNA sequencing (RNAseq) experiment presented in Extended Data Fig. 4 of the Letter cannot be those specified in
the figure legend. Moreover, these data cannot generate the Sylamer plots presented in this
figure. The cell line substitution also casts doubt on which cells were used for experiments
presented elsewhere in the paper. Although replication of other experiments in the Letter
have not uncovered any further inconsistencies, given this uncertainty and the clear issues
with Extended Data Fig. 4, we think it prudent to retract the paper pending more thorough
investigation. We apologize for any adverse consequences that this may have caused.
