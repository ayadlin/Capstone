ABSTRACT:
Angiogenesis is one of the key hallmarks of cancer. In this study, we investigated
whether γ-tocotrienol can abrogate angiogenesis-mediated tumor growth in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and if so, through what molecular mechanisms. We
observed that γ-tocotrienol inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)induced migration, invasion, tube formation and viability of HUVECs in vitro. Moreover,
γ-tocotrienol reduced the number of capillary sprouts from matrigel embedded
rat thoracic aortic ring in a dose-dependent manner. Also, in chick chorioallantoic
membrane assay, γ-tocotrienol significantly reduced the blood vessels formation. We
further noticed that γ-tocotrienol blocked angiogenesis in an in vivo matrigel plug
assay. Furthermore, γ-tocotrienol inhibited VEGF-induced autophosphorylation of
VEGFR2 in HUVECs and also suppressed the constitutive activation of AKT/mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction cascades in HUVECs as well as in HCC
cells. Interestingly, γ-tocotrienol was also found to significantly reduce the tumor
growth in an orthotopic HCC mouse model and inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis in
HCC patient xenografts through the suppression of various biomarkers of proliferation
and angiogenesis. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that γ-tocotrienol
might be a promising anti-angiogenic drug with significant antitumor activity in HCC.

malformations [1, 2]. It is now well established that
angiogenesis is vital for invasive tumor growth and
metastasis and contributes significantly to cancer
progression [3, 4]. For tumors to develop in size
and achieve metastatic potential they must make an
“angiogenic switch”, a complex cascade of events, which
is turned on when the concentration of natural proangiogenic factors outweighs that of anti-angiogenic [3,
5]. The newly generated blood vessels supply adequate
oxygen and nutrition, supporting the growth of tumor
mass, and later aid in the initiation of metastasis, which
contributes to >90% of deaths in various cancers including
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [6, 7]. Although
numerous pro-angiogenic factors have been identified
as potential mediators of the angiogenic switch, the
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appears to
be a key factor in pathological situations that involve
tumor neovascularization [8]. VEGF is a specific mitogen
and survival factor for endothelial cells in vitro, capable
of directly stimulating their growth and also acts as a
potent angiogenic factor while promoting angiogenesis
in vivo [6, 9]. VEGF regulates angiogenesis mainly
via two interacting tyrosine kinase receptors, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and
vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGFR2), but its
signal transduction and biological responses are mediated
primarily via VEGFR2 [9, 10].
HCC’s are highly vascular tumors with high
microvessel density and levels of circulating VEGF,
thus making the angiogenesis pathway an attractive
therapeutic target [11, 12]. A number of angiogenesis
blockers, including small molecule kinase inhibitors and
monoclonal antibodies are currently being evaluated as
potential therapeutic agents against HCC [11, 13-15].
Treatment with endogenous angiogenic inhibitors such
as endostatin and angiostatin has been found to reverse
the angiogenic switch thereby significantly preventing
growth of tumor vasculature [15, 16]. However, most
of the anti-angiogenic therapies currently available
for treatment have significant side effects [14, 17]. So
the identication of pharmacological agents targeting
angiogenesis is considered an important strategy both for
cancer prevention and treatment.
Small molecules derived from natural products
provide a potential drug pool in the development of
new bioactive molecules [18]. In the present study,
we investigated the anti-invasive, anti-angiogenic and
anticancer potential of a vitamin E derivative, γ-tocotrienol
derived from palm oil in endothelial and HCC cell lines
and orthotopic mouse model. Increasing evidences indicate
that γ-tocotrienol exerts significant antiprolifeartive/proapoptotic effects in diverse cancers, including breast,
liver, lung, gastric, colorectal, skin and prostate cancers
[19-22] through the negative regulation of various
oncogenic molecules including NF-κB [23, 24], STAT3
[25], telomerase [26], peroxisome proliferator-activated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

receptor gamma [27], hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha
[28], Wnt/β-catenin [29], epidermal growth factor [22] and
inhibitor of differentiation family proteins [30]. Although,
few prior studies have indicated that palm tocotrienols can
inhibit angiogenesis [31-33] and decrease levels of proangiogenic markers [34], but the underlying molecular
mechanisms and whether γ-tocotrienol specifically affects
tumor angiogenesis and growth in HCC has never been
studied before. We observed that γ-tocotrienol can indeed
attenuate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion
and tube formation through the abrogation of VEGFR2mediated AKT/mTOR signaling cascades. In vivo,
γ-tocotrienol inhibited chick chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) and VEGF-induced angiogenesis and the growth
of tumor in an orthotopic HCC mouse model through the
modulation of various oncogenic biomarkers.

RESULTS
γ-tocotrienol
suppresses
VEGF-induced
migratory and invasive potential of HUVEC in
vitro
Endothelial cell migration is one of the most
important and early event during the process of
angiogenesis [8]. To assess the in vitro anti-angiogenic
property of γ-tocotrienol, we examined its effects on
the chemotactic motility of endothelial cells using the
wound-healing migration and invasion assays. When
HUVEC migration was stimulated with VEGF, the wound
closing in cells treated with γ-tocotrienol was much less
when compared to control (VEGF alone) (Fig. 1A).
Similar results were obtained when HUVECs treated with
γ-tocotrienol were allowed to invade the matrigel coated
polycarbonate membrane (Fig. 1B).

γ-tocotrienol abrogates VEGF-induced HUVEC
capillary-like structure formation and viability in
vitro
HUVECs can also spontaneously form three
dimensional capillary-like tubular structures when
cultured on matrigel. Tube formation assay represents
a simple, reliable and powerful model for studying
inhibitors of angiogenesis and so we studied the effects
of γ-tocotrienol on tubulogenesis in HUVECs. Our results
indicated that HUVECs can form robust tubular-like
structures when seeded on growth factor–reduced twodimensional matrigel, in the presence of VEGF. However,
treatment with γ-tocotrienol resulted in significant
reduction in the number and the continuity of HUVEC
capillary-like structures in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
1C), suggesting that in vitro HUVEC tube formation is

inhibited. The process of angiogenesis also requires the
proliferation of endothelial cells, so we examined the
effect of γ-tocotrienol on VEGF-induced proliferation
of HUVEC cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, treatment of
HUVECs with γ-tocotrienol resulted in a dose-depend
reduction in VEGF-induced cell viability. Overall, these
findings clearly demonstrated that γ-tocotrienol can
cause significant inhibition of VEGF-induced migration,
invasion, tube formation and proliferation of HUVECs.

We further explored the anti-angiogenic activity of
γ-tocotrienol using 2 ex vivo angiogenesis models, the rat
thoracic aortic ring and the chick embryo chorioallantoic
membrane assays. The serum-free three-dimensional
rat aortic model closely approximates the complexities

vitro and cell viability. A, γ-tocotrienol inhibited HUVEC migration. An IBIDI culture insert (IBIDI GmbH) consists of two reservoirs

separated by a 500 µm thick wall created by a culture insert in a 35mm petri dish. An equal number of HUVECs (70 µl; 5×105 cells/ml) were
added into the two reservoirs of the same insert and incubated at 37°C/5% CO2. After 12 hours, the insert was gently removed creating a
gap of ~500 µm. The cells were treated with 50 μM γ-tocotrienol for 12 h before being exposed to 10ng/mL VEGF for 24 h. Width of wound
was measured at time zero and 24h of incubation with and without γ-tocotrienol. The representative photographs showed the same area at
time zero and after 24 h of incubation. B, γ-tocotrienol inhibited HUVEC invasion through matrigel coated polycarbonate membrane. After
pre-incubation with or without 50 µM γ-tocotrienol for 12 h, transwell chambers were then placed into the wells of a 24-well plate, in which
we had added Medium 200 containing 10 ng/mL VEGF. After incubation for 24h cell invasion was analyzed and columns represent mean

of angiogenesis in vivo, from endothelial activation to
pericyte acquisition and remodelling. So we analyzed
the sprouting of micro-vessels from aortic rings in the
presence or absence of γ-tocotrienol. VEGF significantly
stimulated microvessel sprouting, leading to the formation
of a network of vessels around the aortic rings (Fig. 2A).
The presence of γ-tocotrienol at different concentrations
significantly antagonized the VEGF-induced sprouting
in a dose-dependent manner as evidenced by a decrease
in the numbers of microvessel spouting as shown in Fig.
2B. In the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, the
fertilized chicken eggs can form blood vessels, especially

microvessels and serve as an ideal indicator of the anti- or
pro-angiogenic properties of drugs. As shown in Fig. 3A
and 3B, treatment with γ-tocotrienol significantly reduced
the number of microvessels when compared to VEGF
alone control, demonstrating that γ-tocotrienol can indeed
inhibit CAM induced angiogenesis.

plug assay. As shown in Fig. 3C, matrigel plugs
containing VEGF alone appeared dark red, indicating that
functional vasculatures had formed inside the matrigel
via angiogenesis triggered by VEGF. In contrast, the
addition of different concentrations of γ-tocotrienol (10 or
20 μg per plug) to the matrigel plugs containing VEGF
dramatically inhibited vascular formation. These plugs
displayed much paler appearance at 10 μg and showed
almost no vascular formation at 20 μg. H&E staining of
the functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs (Fig. 3D)
showed that γ-tocotrienol at a dose of 20 μg dramatically
blocked VEGF-induced vasculature formation in vivo.

To elucidate the molecular basis of anti-angiogenic
activity, we examined the signaling cascades modulated by
γ-tocotrienol in HUVECs using western blot analysis. In
tumor microenvironment, one of the most potent mediators
of the angiogenic switch is VEGF, which mediates its
signaling events through VEGFR2 phosphorylation [9].
VEGFR-2 is thought to be the primary receptor involved
in angiogenesis, and its activation is considered critical
in endothelial cell migration, proliferation and survival

Figure 3: A, γ-tocotrienol inhibits angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The rectangular

filters papers contained VEGF alone or in combinaiton with γ-Tocotrienol. The representative photographs of control and γ-tocotrienoltreated CAMs were shown. B, The number of the microvessels was quantified manually and displayed as bar diagram *p < 0.01 versus

matrigel containing 10 or 20 μg γ-tocotrienol, 100 ng of VEGF, and 20 units of heparin into the ventral area (n = 5 per group). After 6
days, the skin of mice was pulled back to expose the intact Matrigel plugs and were photographed. D, γ-Tocotrienol inhibited blood vessel
formation. The Matrigel plugs were fixed, sectioned, and stained with H&E (magnification, ×200).

[10], hence we next examined the effect of γ-tocotrienol
on VEGFR2 activation. The phosphorylation of VEGFR2
at Try1175 residue was suppressed by γ-tocotrienol in a
time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). These results indicated
that the observed anti-angiogenic effects of γ-tocotrienol
may be partially mediated through inhibition of VEGR2
activation.
Our next series of experiments were aimed at
investigating the effects of γ-tocotrienol on the key
components of the downstream signaling pathway that
regulate the endothelial cell function in angiogenesis. We
found that γ-tocotrienol effectively suppressed VEGFtriggered activation of AKT/mTOR signaling cascade,
including AKT, mTOR, and P70S6 kinases in HUVECs

in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B), suggesting that
anti-angiogenic effects of γ-tocotrienol may be mediated
through negative regulation of the AKT/mTOR signaling
cascade.

γ-tocotrienol induces apoptosis and inhibits AKT/
mTOR signaling pathway in HCC cells
Whether γ-tocotrienol can induce apoptosis through
the abrogation of AKT/mTOR pathway in HCC cells was
investigated next. MTT analysis showed that γ-tocotrienol
caused a significant dose-dependent inhibition in the
proliferation of highly metastatic HCCLM3 cells (Fig.

signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Proteins from different treatments were probed with phospho-specific antibodies. The same blots

5A). We also noticed that γ-tocotrienol significantly
induced apoptosis in HCCLM3 cells as evident by
substantial cleavage of full-length PARP (116 kDa) into
its large cleavage fragment (89 kDa) (Fig. 5B). These
findings suggest that γ-tocotrienol also has direct apoptotic
effects on HCC cells besides its anti-angiogenic effect
on endothelial cells. Treatment with γ-tocotrienol also
inhibited the activation of AKT, mTOR, and P70S6K
kinases in a time-dependent manner in HCCLM3 cells
(Fig. 5C), suggesting that the AKT/mTOR pathway
may mediate both anti-angiogenic/anti-tumor effects of
γ-tocotrienol.

Prior to the first therapeutic injection (10 days after
tumor implantation), the presence of growing orthotopic
tumors could be detected and are mainly confined to
the liver (Fig. 6A). Mice were treated five times a week
with either vehicles alone (n = 5) or 3.25 mg (n = 6) of
γ-tocotrienol for up to five weeks. Bioluminescence
imaging revealed the significant inhibition of tumor
growth in the γ-tocotrienol-treated group compared with
the vehicle-treated control group (Fig. 6A). Quantitative
analysis at set time points were quantitated by measuring
photon counts and expressed as tumor burden relative to
photon counts before the first therapeutic injection (Fig.
6B). It was determined that γ-tocotrienol at 3.25 mg
induced significant inhibition of tumor growth compared
with the vehicle-treated controls, p=0.0042 (Fig. 6C).
No significant changes in body weight were observed
in the treated mice, showing that γ-tocotrienol produced
insignificant toxicity in the treated mice at the curative
dose (Fig. 6D).

compared with control group (Fig. 7B). Also treatment
with γ-tocotrienol led to a decrease in the expression of
VEGF protein and increase in the expression of cleaved

anti-angiogenic and pro-apototic agent in HCC.

We next evaluated the effect of γ-tocotrienol on
the expression of Ki-67 (marker of proliferation), VEGF,

apoptosis) in HCC tumor tissues by immunohistochemical
analysis. As shown in Fig. 7A, expression of Ki-67,
VEGF, and CD31 was downregulated and that of cleaved
caspase-3 was significantly increased in γ-tocotrienol

analyzed the effect of γ-tocotrienol on constitutive p-AKT

and HCC020113. The HCC cells prepared were mixed
with matrigel and injected into the flanks of mice with or
without γ-tocotrienol. Gel plugs were harvested 7 days
after implantation. Both cell suspensions induced blood
vessel formation in the plug (Fig. 7C). However, blood
vessel formations induced by the cell suspensions were
significantly reduced in the presence of 20 ug γ-tocotrienol
(Fig. 7C).

The goal of this study was to examine whether
γ-tocotrienol can inhibit the angiogenesis mediated
growth of HCC carcinoma through abrogation of AKT/
mTOR pathway in an orthotopic mouse model. Our results
suggest that γ-tocotrienol is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor
and inhibits multiple steps of angiogenesis, including
endothelial cell viability, migration, invasion, and
differentiation into capillary like structures. γ-tocotrienol
was found to exert its anti-angiogenic effects via targeting

AKT/mTOR signaling cascade in endothelial HCC cells.
We also observed for the first time that γ-tocotrienol can
significantly suppress tumor growth in an orthotopic
human HCC mouse model through the suppression of
various mediators of proliferation, angiogenesis and
survival.
The process of angiogenesis has been recognized
to play a crucial role in cancer progression as the newly
formed tumor vasculature serve initially as feeding tubes
providing nutrients and oxygen supply for the growing
tumor mass and finally as conduits for dissemination
of tumor cells that have escaped from the established
primary tumor [17]. The current strategies for anticancer
therapy become ineffective once tumor cells reach favored
secondary organs and generate metastatic foci. Therefore
control of tumor angiogenesis has become a central issue
in the fight against cancer progression [14]. Anti-cancer
drugs such as bevacizumab (anti-VEGF monoclonal
antibody) and vatalanib (VEGFR inhibitor) have already
been successfully approved for clinically treating many
malignant tumors by targeting anti-angiogenic mediators
[15, 16]. However, the identification of novel antiangiogenic agents with anti-tumor activity and less side
effects is urgently needed.
Endothelial cells, which are the major components
making up blood vessels, proliferate rapidly during
angiogenesis than under normal conditions. As VEGF is
the major mediator of tumor associated angiogenesis, we
analyzed the rate of proliferation and viability of HUVECs
stimulated with VEGF. The ability of γ-tocotrienol to
reduce the VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells
indicated the ability of this vitamin E isoform to abrogate
the formation of tumor vasculature. Treatment of HUVECs
with γ-tocotrienol effectively abrogated VEGF-induced
migration, invasion, and capillary-like structures formation
in vitro. VEGF generally exerts its biological effects by
binding to transmembrane receptors such as VEGFR1 and
VEGFR2, both of which are specifically expressed on the
surfaces of endothelial cells and contain a cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinase domain [15]. The binding of VEGF to
VEGFRs leads to conformational changes in the receptors,
followed by dimerization and autophosphorylation of
the tyrosine residues [8]. Interestingly, we found that
γ-tocotrienol substantially down-regulated the VEGFinduced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in HUVECs, thereby
indicating that the anti-angiogenic effects of this Vitamin
E isoform may be partially mediated through inhibition
of VEGR2 activation. We also further validated the antiangiogenic properties of γ-tocotrienol using ex vivo rat
thoracic aortic ring capillary formation, CAM, and the in
vivo matrigel plug assays.
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is involved in the
regulation of multiple cellular processes, including cell
proliferation, migration, invasion and survival. In many
cancers this pathway is overactive, reducing apoptosis,
allowing proliferation and thus enhanced signaling
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

through this pathway is a significant contributor to new
blood vessel formation [35, 36]. The activation of the
AKT/mTOR/p70S6 kinase pathway during normal
blood vessel development can promote angiogenesis by
increasing VEGF expression in a HIF-1α dependent and
independent manner [37]. A previous study reported that
mTOR, an important downstream target of PI3K/AKT,
can also increase HIF-1α-dependent gene expression
in certain tumor cell types [38]. Mammalian mTOR is
known to regulate translation through p70S6K1 and
the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding
proteins. P70S6K1 activation is found in various human
cancers such as thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and
ovarian cancer and P70S6K1 plays an important role in
phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-negative and
in AKT-overexpressing tumors [36, 39]. Recent studies
also suggest that P70S6 kinase, downstream of mTOR,
drives the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in human
ovarian cancer, mediating tumor growth and angiogenesis.
We found that treatment with γ-tocotrienol substantially
reduced the activation of AKT/mTOR/ P70S6 kinases in
endothelial cells in a time-dependent manner. Although,
prior studies have indicated that palm tocotrienols can
inhibit angiogenesis [31-33, 40] and decrease levels of
pro-angiogenic markers [28, 34], the exact molecular
mechanisms of these anti-angiogenic effects have never
been investigated before. Our findings that γ-tocotrienol
can significantly reduce VEGF-induced migration,
invasion, and angiogenesis through the modulation of
AKT/mTOR pathway is contrary to a previously published
study in which this Vitamin E isoform was shown to
exert its anti-angiogenic effects via down-regulation of
β-catenin pathway [33], whereas δ-tocotrienol isoform
acted similarly by reducing HIF-1α-protein expression or
increasing HIF-1α-degradation [28].
We further noticed that γ-tocotrienol treatment also
induced substantial apoptosis in HCCLM3 cells, which are
fairly resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents
as evident by PARP cleavage assay. These results are
consistent with our previous report in which γ-tocotrienol
was found to induce apoptosis in another HCC cell line,
namely HepG2 [25]. We also report for the first time that
γ-tocotrienol treatment at a dose of 3.25 mg per mice
(equivalent to around 700 mg dose in a 60 kg human)
significantly suppressed HCC growth in orthotopic
mouse model and downregulated the expression of
various biomarkers of proliferation and angiogenesis in
tumor tissues. Western blot analysis data also revealed
that γ-tocotrienol treatment can substantially inhibit the
expression of phospho-AKT and VEGF, and increase
the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in tumor tissues as
compared to the control. We also demonstrate for the first
time the potential of γ-tocotrienol to inhibit tumor-induced
angiogenesis in HCC patient xenografts implanted in
SCID mice.
To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies with

γ-tocotrienol have been conducted in HCC mouse models,

holds enormous promise for the treatment of HCC
through the abrogation of AKT/mTOR pathway. These

γ-tocotrienol has been found to be well tolerated in preclinical studies, with no reported toxicity [19, 41, 42].

have been described previously[43]. HCCLM3 were
cultured in high glucose DMEM containing 1× antibioticantimycotic solution with 10% FBS. HUVECs and
HCCLM3 cells were cultured at 37°C under a humidified
95%:5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2.

CONCLUSIONS
Thus, overall, our experimental findings clearly
indicate that the anti-cancer effects of γ-tocotrienol in
HCC are mediated through the mitigation of AKT/mTOR
signaling cascade and thus provide a strong rationale for
pursuing the use of γ-tocotrienol in the treatment of HCC
and other malignancies where angiogenesis is the key
contributor to disease progression. Because γ-tocotrienol
is non-toxic and currently undergoing clinical trials, the
present study would provide the basis of novel therapeutic
options for the treatment of HCC patients.

Wound healing migration assay
The migration of cells was investigated using a
wound healing assay. An IBIDI culture insert (ibidi GmbH,
Munich, Germany) consists of two reservoirs separated by
a 500 µm thick wall created by a culture insert in a 35
mm petri dish. For migration assay, HUVECs were starved
to inactivate cell proliferation and then an equal number
of cells (70 µl; 5×105 cells/ml) were added into the two
reservoirs of the same insert and incubated at 37°C/5%
CO2. After 12 h, the insert was gently removed creating a
gap of ~500 µm. The cells were treated with γ-tocotrienol
(50 μM) for 12 h before being exposed to VEGF (10 ng/
mL) for 24 h. After incubation, the wounds were observed
using bright field microscopy and multiple images were
taken at areas flanking the intersections of the wound. Gap
distance of the wound was measured at three different sites
using Photoshop software, and the data were normalized to
the average of the control. Graphs were plotted against the
percentage of migration distance the cells moved before
and after treatment, normalized to control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
γ-tocotrienol with purity more than 97% was
obtained from Davos Life Science, Singapore in the form
of Naturale3 γ-tocotrienol. γ-tocotrienol was dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a 10 mM stock solution
and stored at 4°C for the in vitro experiments. Further
dilution was done in cell culture medium as required.
Human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and growth factor reduced (GFR) matrigel
matrix were purchased from BD Biosciences (CA, USA).
Mayer’s hematoxylin solution, eosin Y Solution, MTT,

Invasion assay
The in vitro invasion assay was performed using
Bio-Coat matrigel invasion assay system (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 5×104 HUVECs were suspended in Medium
200 and seeded into the Matrigel transwell chambers
consisting of polycarbonate membranes with 8 μm
pores. After pre-incubation with or without γ-tocotrienol
for 12 h, the transwell chambers were then placed into
appropriate wells of a 24 well plate, in which either the
basal medium only or basal medium containing 10 ng/
mL VEGF had been added. After incubation, the upper
surfaces of the Transwell chambers were wiped with
cotton swabs, and the invading cells were fixed and stained
with crystal violet solution. The invading cells were then
counted in five randomly selected areas under microscopic
observation as described previously [44].

the yolk vessels lying on top of undamaged yolk. As a
carrier, a 3x3 mm Whatman filter disk pretreated by 20
μg/disk γ-tocotrienol with or without 100 ng VEGF was
put onto the CAM. The ex ovo cultures are returned to
an incubator and kept at 38.2°C and 60% humidity for
another 5 days. Then the CAM was observed under
microscope, and the neovascularization was quantified.
Two independent experiments were performed (n=10/
group).

Tube formation was assessed as described
previously [45]. Briefly, HUVECs were pretreated with
various dilutions of γ-tocotrienol for 12 h and then seeded
onto the Matrigel layer in 24-well plates at a density of 5
× 104 cells in Medium 200 with or without VEGF. After 6
h, tubular structure of endothelial cells was photographed
using an inverted microscope. Three independent
experiments were performed.

Matrigel plug assay

MTT assay

Matrigel plug assay was performed as described
previously [48]. Matrigel (0.5 mL) containing 100 ng
VEGF and 20 units of heparin with or without 10 or 20
μg of γ-tocotrienol were injected subcutaneously into the
ventral area of C57/BL/6 mice (n=5 per group). After
6 days, the mice were sacrificed using CO2 and intact
Matrigel plugs from all groups of mice with different
treatments were removed. The removed matigel plugs
were photographed and then fixed with 10% neutral
buffered formalin and paraffin sections were used for H&E
staining to identify the formation and infiltration of new
microvessels. Functional microvessels with RBC were
quantified manually using a microscope (magnification,
200X).

The antiproliferative effect of γ-tocotrienol against
HUVECs and HCC cell lines was determined by the MTT
dye uptake method. Briefly, the cells (5 × 103/well) were
incubated in triplicate in a 96-well plate in the presence
or absence of indicated concentrations of γ-tocotrienol
in a final volume of 0.2 ml for 24 h at 37 °C. HUVECs
were treated with or without 10 ng/mL VEGF. Thereafter,
20 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to
each well. After a 4 h incubation in the dark at 37°C, 0.1
ml of lysis buffer (20% SDS, 50% dimethylformamide)
was added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C, followed by
measurement of optical density at 570 nm by Tecan plate
reader (Durham, NC).

Tumor-induced angiogenesis

Rat aortic ring assay

All procedures were reviewed and approved by the
SingHealth IRB and Animal Use and Care Committee.
Single cell suspensions freshly derived from HCC patients’
xenografts, designated as HCC180811 and HCC020113,
were mixed with phenol red-free matrigel and injected
into both flanks of severely combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mice. For γ-tocotrienol treated group, matrigel
was mixed with cells in the presence of 20 μg γ-tocotrienol
and 20 units of heparin. Matrigel mixed with the cell
suspensions alone was used as negative control. Seven
days post-implantation, matrigel plugs were removed and
photographed.

Rat aortic ring assay was performed as described
previously [46]. In brief, aortas isolated from SpragueDawley rats were cleaned of fibroadipose tissue and
colateral vessels and cut into approximately 1 mm long
rings. The aortic rings were randomized into Growth
Factor Reduced Matrigel-coated wells and further
sealed with a 100 μl overlay of Matrigel. Medium 200
containing with and without VEGF along with different
dilutions of γ-tocotrienol was added to the wells and
incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 6 days. At the end of
incubation, the microvessel sprouting formed were fixed
and photographed using a Nikon inverted microscope
(magnification, 100X). Two independent experiments
were performed.

Western blotting

Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)
assay

For detection of phopho-proteins, γ-tocotrienol
treated cells were harvested and lysed in whole cell lysis
buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA
(pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.005
mg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mM PMSF, and 4 mM NaVO4).
Lysates were then spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to
remove insoluble material and stored at −80°C for later
use. The protein content in the lysates was measured by
Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (BioRad, CA) and equal quantity of protein was resolved on

Fertilized chicken eggs were purchased from SSS
Exports International (Tamil Nadu, India). According to
a previously described method [47], fertilized eggs are
incubated at 37.5°C with the relative humidity 60-62% for
72 h. The egg is held horizontally and cracked on the edge,
keeping close to the bottom of a petri dish and content of

electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked
with 5% nonfat milk, and probed with appropriate
antibody overnight at 4°C. The blot was washed,
exposed to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1
h, and finally examined by chemiluminescence (ECL; GE

instructions. Immunoreactive species were detected
using 3, 3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)
as a substrate. Sections were counterstained with Gill’s
hematoxylin and mounted under glass cover slips.
Images were taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope
(magnification, 40X).

Statistical analysis

Orthotopic HCC mouse model

Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. In all figures,
vertical error bars denote the S.D. The significance of
differences between groups was evaluated by Student’s
t-test and one way analysis of variance, (ANOVA) test.
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

All procedures involving animals were reviewed
and approved by the SingHealth Animal Use and Care
Committee. Ten week-old Balb/c nude female mice
(Biolasco, Taiwan) were implanted orthotopically with
approximately 1 mm3 of human HCCLM3_Luc2 tumor
stably expressing firefly luciferase. Tumor growth was
monitored bi-weekly by bioluminescence imaging using
IVIS 200 Bioluminescence Imaging System (Xenogen
Corp., Alameda, CA). Mice were randomized and
treatment was started once the observed bioluminescent
signal increased steadily. Mice were administered 3.25
mg γ-tocotrienol in the form of self-emulsifying mixture
by oral gavage 5 days a week. For control, γ-tocotrienol
in the formulation was substituted by corn oil. All mice
were euthanized once the tumor signal reached above 1 x
1011 photons per second (p/s), and tumor were harvested
for subsequent analysis. For imaging, mice were given
i.p. injections of 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (Xenogen) 10
minutes before imaging. To quantitate tumor burden,
bioluminescence signals were calculated from the imaging
data using the Living Image software 3.2 (Xenogen)
according to manufacturer’s protocol.
