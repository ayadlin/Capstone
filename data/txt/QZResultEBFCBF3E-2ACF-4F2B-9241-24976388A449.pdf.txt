BACKGROUND: Preclinical data indicate that there is substantial antitumor activity and synergy between calcitriol
and dexamethasone. On the basis of these data, the authors conducted a phase 2 trial of intravenous (iv) calcitriol at
a dose of 74 lg weekly (based on a recent phase 1 trial) and dexamethasone in patients with castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: A 2-stage Kepner-Chang design was used. Oral dexamethasone at a dose of 4
mg was given weekly on Days 1 and 2, and iv calcitriol (74 lg over 1 hour) was administered weekly on Day 2 from 4
to 8 hours after the dexamethasone dose in patients with CRPC. Laboratory data were monitored weekly, and renal
sonograms, computed tomography scans, and bone scans were obtained every 3 months. Disease response was
assessed by using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and standard criteria for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. The calcitriol dose was delineated by from the authors’ recent phase 1 trial. RESULTS:
Of 18 evaluable patients, 15 patients were Caucasian (83%). No patients had a complete or partial response by either
RECIST or PSA response criteria. Fourteen patients had progressive disease, 2 patients refused to continue treatment
(after 64 days and 266 days), and 2 patients remain on the trial (for 306 days and 412 days).The median time to disease progression was 106 days (95% confidence interval, 80-182 days). Fourteen episodes of grade 3 or 4 toxicity
were noted in 7 patients (hyperglycemia, hypocalemia, chest pain, dyspnea, hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and pain). Only 1 episode of grade 3/ 4 toxicity was related definitely to calcitriol (hypercalcemia).
No treatment-related deaths were noted. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose, iv calcitriol at a dose of 74 lg weekly in combination with dexamethasone was well tolerated but failed to produce a clinical or PSA response in men with CRPC.

Cancer of the prostate is the most prevalent cancer among American men.1 At the time of diagnosis, many patients

have disease that extends beyond the prostate gland.2 Disseminated prostate cancer is treated primarily by local palliative
measures and by testicular androgen ablation. Progression of disease after primary hormone therapy occurs in almost all
individuals. The median survival after onset of disease progression in such men is ranges from 18 months to 24 months.
Several secondary hormone manipulations are available; however, responses to such approaches are <30% and no survival
benefit has been demonstrated.3-7 We have developed a substantial body of information suggesting that vitamin D or D
analogues, in combination with glucocorticoids, may have merit in such men.

model systems, and in human breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer, as well as leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma
lines.8-16,17 Calcitriol and its analogues induce G0/G1
arrest and a decrease in cells in S phase.18,19 Calcitriol also
increases expression of p27Kipl and p21Waf1/Cipl, the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors implicated in G1
arrest.20 Calcitriol induces cleavage of caspase 3, polyadenyl ribose 6 phosphate (PARP), and the growth-promoting/prosurvival signaling molecule mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MEK) in a caspase-dependent manner.15,17 Calcitriol inhibits the phosphorylation and
expression of Akt, a kinase that regulates an important cell
survival pathway. In contrast to cytotoxic drug-induced
apoptosis, the proapoptotic signaling molecule MEKK-1
is up-regulated significantly by calcitriol.14
Dexamethasone potentiates the antitumor effect of
calcitriol and decreases calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia.21 It also enhances antitumor activity through the
up-regulation of vitamin D receptor ligand binding in the
tumor and may abrogate calcitriol-associated hypercalcemia through the down-regulation of vitamin D receptor
ligand binding in the intestinal mucosa, where dexamethasone is known to inhibit calcium absorption.22
In a phase 2 study of oral calcitriol (12 lg on Days
1, 2, and 3 weekly) and dexamethasone (4 mg on Days 0,
1, 2, and 3 weekly) in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the combination was well tolerated
and resulted in a response rate of 19%.23 That trial used
Rocaltrol, the oral formulation (Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals
Inc., Gurgaon, India), and it was administered well below
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). To address the issue
of bioavailability with the oral route of administration, we
conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation trial of intravenous
(iv) calcitriol in combination with a fixed dose of oral gefitinib of 250 mg daily.24 Results from this trial indicted
that iv calcitriol is safe and feasible. Dose-limiting hypercalcemia was noted at a weekly calcitriol dose of 96 lg,
and the MTD was confirmed at 74 lg of calcitriol per
week when given with gefitinib. On the basis of these
data, we conducted a phase 2 trial of iv calcitriol at 74 lg
(the recommended phase 2 dose) weekly along with oral
dexamethasone 4 mg twice weekly in patients with
CRPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Objectives
The primary objective of this study was to determine the
response rate of iv calcitriol plus oral dexamethasone in

Cancer

patients with CRPC. The secondary objective was to evaluate the toxicity of high-dose iv calcitriol and dexamethasone in patients with prostate cancer.
Eligibility Criteria
Patients who had a history of CRPC with evidence of rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level with or without
new radiographic or clinically evaluable lesions, PSA 5
ng/dL and clearly rising on 2 measurements at least 2
weeks apart after androgen deprivation (orchiectomy or
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue) and
antiandrogen withdrawal were considered eligible. The
last dose of antiandrogen therapy must have been received
28 days (42 days for bicalutamide) before study treatment. Other inclusion criteria included: absolute neutrophil count 1000/mm3, platelet count 75,000/mm3,
hemoglobin >8.9 g/dL, normal serum corrected calcium,
normal liver function (aspartate aminotransferase level
4times the upper limit of normal, total bilirubin 2.0
mg/dL), serum creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, an Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2,
expected survival of at least 12 weeks, and the ability to
sign an informed consent. Exclusion criteria included a
previous history of nephrolithiasis within 5 years and
uncontrolled diabetes. The receipt of previous anticancer
therapy with calcitriol or calcitriol analogs was not
allowed.
Treatment Plan
Commercially available iv calcitriol (Sivor Inc., Irvine,
Calif) in 1-lg ampoules was used. Calcitriol was prepared
according to the previously described procedures, diluted
in 100 mL normal saline in a polyvinyl chloride bag to
maintain the appropriate maximum concentration.24
Such preparations were used within 3 hours of preparation. Intravenous calcitriol was administered on Day 2 of
each week (74 lg) over 1 hour, 4 to 8 hours after Day 2
dexamethasone. Commercially available dexamethasone
as 4-mg oral tablets was administered orally on Day 1 and
Day 2 each week. The dexamethasone dose and schedule
were chosen based on previous experience with docetaxel
plus dexamethasone in which this dose and schedule of
dexamethasone did not appear to induce a PSA
response.25,26 No dose escalation was allowed. Patients
who had not undergone bilateral orchiectomy were continued on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs. Calcium supplementation was not allowed. Patients
who were receiving bisphosphonate therapy at the time of
study entry were permitted to continue. Supportive care

with the use of blood transfusions and erythropoetic
agents was permitted. Patients were continued on study
drugs until they had evidence of either disease progression
or intolerable toxicity. Patients who received any calcitriol
and dexamethasone were evaluable for toxicity.
Patient Monitoring and Dose Modification
Serum calcium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and
phosphorus levels were obtained weekly before calcitriol
was given. Complete blood counts, electrolytes, PSA, glucose and liver function studies were done monthly. A renal ultrasound (RUS) study was obtained before therapy
and was repeated every 3 months. Physical examination
and toxicity assessments were done at the initiation of
therapy and every 4 weeks thereafter. Imaging studies
(computed tomography or bone scans) were obtained every 12 weeks to assess response.
Therapy was discontinued if the absolute neutrophil
count fell below 500/ mm3 or if the platelet count was
<20,000/ mm3. Therapy was reinstituted when the absolute neutrophil count was >1000/ mm3, the platelet
count was >75,000/ mm3, AND stable or responding disease was documented. Treatment was held for a serum calcium level >14.0 mg/dL (corrected). Calcium levels were
obtained weekly, and calcitriol was resumed at 50% of the
previous dose when the calcium level returned to <10.5
mg/dL. Patients who developed symptomatic nephrolithiasis or pancreatitis or who had nephrolithiasis detected
by RUS were to be taken off study. Drug administration
was held if the serum creatinine reached 2 times the
baseline level or >2.5 mg/dL. Treatment could be reinitiated if the creatinine recovered to <1.5 times the baseline
level or <2.0 mg/dL. Toxicity was graded according to
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3.0).27 After the first occurrence of any unmanageable and clinically meaningful grade 3 toxicity, calcitriol was held until there was resolution to grade 1 or
baseline. Patients who experienced any persistent or recurrent, unmanageable and clinically meaningful grade 3 or
greater toxicity were taken off study permanently. All
adverse drug reactions were reported to the Roswell Park
Institutional Review Board.
Measurement of Effect
Patients with measurable bidimensional or unidimensional, nonosseous disease (eg, mediastinal, abdominal,
or pulmonary mass or hepatomegaly) were assessed
using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).28 Standard PSA response criteria were used.29

2134

A complete response was defined as normalization of PSA
to <4 ng/mL (nonprostatectomy) or <0.2 ng/mL (previous prostatectomy) on 3 successive determinations
obtained 4 weeks apart. A partial response was defined as
a decrease >50% in PSA that persisted for at least 4 weeks.
Disease progression was defined as an increase in PSA to
50% above the baseline level maintained for >4 weeks.
Statistical Design
The current study was designed as a 2-stage, phase 2 trial
using a Kepner-Chang type 2 design.30 The trial was
designed to accrue 18 patients in the first stage and 18
more patients in the second stage. The historic (dexamethasone alone) and expected (calcitriol plus dexamethasone)
objective response rates (complete or partial) were estimated at 25% and 45%, respectively, with type I and II
errors of 4% and 19%, respectively. In stage 1, if there were
4 responses in 18 evaluable patients, then the study
would be terminated because of futility, and the treatment
would not be recommended for further study. If there were
5 responses, then 18 more evaluable patients would be
accrued at stage 2. If there were 14 responses among all
36 evaluable patients, then it would be concluded that the
response rate was >25% and the treatment would deserve
additional study. If there were 13 objective responses
among all 36 evaluable patients, then the treatment would
not be recommended for further study.
PSA dynamics were studied in a purely exploratory
manner. Changes in PSA slope before and after treatment
were calculated using a linear mixed model.31,32 The time
of PSA test was calculated from date of the PSA test minus
the date treatment was started. Thus, a negative time corresponded to a test done before treatment. The response
was defined as the natural logarithm of 1 þ PSA (ie,
loge[1 þ PSA]). A linear mixed model was used to fit
repeated PSA data. After model selection, the final model
contained fixed effects of treatment indicator (before or
after treatment), time, timê2 (quadratic term of time),
interaction between treatment and time, and interaction
between treatment and timê2. Random effects included
intercept and slope with an unstructured covariance matrix. The significance of each effect was assessed by using
an approximate t test.

Response Assessment
Sixteen patients were taken off study, 14 because of
disease progression and 2 because of patient refusal to
continue the study. Because 14 of 18 patients had progressive disease, the stage 1 endpoint of 5 responses for continuation to stage 2 could not be met, and the study was
terminated for futility after stage 1. Two patients currently remain on the study (for 306 days and 412 days).
The median number of calcitriol doses received was
13.5 (range, 5-61 doses). The median time to disease progression was 106 days (95% confidence interval, 80-182
days).
Of 4 patients who had evaluable soft tissue disease,
no patient met the criteria for soft tissue disease response
according to RECIST, and no patient met the standard
criteria for PSA response. Six patients had progressive disease, and 12 patients had stable disease (SD) as their ‘‘best
response’’ to treatment. Table 2 summarizes patient
responses to treatment.
Survival
The estimated median time to progression was 3.5
months, and the median overall survival was 12.9 months
after a median follow-up of 6.8 months (range, 3-18.4
months) at the time the study was closed for data analyses.
Toxicity
Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). All grade 1 and
grade 2 toxicities were readily and rapidly reversible without treatment interruption. Table 3 summarizes the toxicities that were associated with the study drug. Two
episodes of grade 4 toxicity (hyperglycemia and hypocalcemia) were noted and were deemed unrelated to calcitriol. There were 7 patients with grade 3 toxicities and 13
patients with grade 2 toxicities. Only 1 episode of grade
3/4 toxicity could be related definitely to calcitriol administration (hypercalcemia). Other grade 3/4 toxicities that
were noted on study were cardiac arrhythmia, dyspnea,
chest pain, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and pain. None of the patients who were treated on
this study developed grade 2 or greater hematologic toxicity. No treatment-related deaths were noted.
Serum Calcium
Eighteen patients were studied, and 373 weekly serum
calcium values were assessed. Fifty-two corrected serum
calcium values were >11 mg/dL (13.9%), and 9 were
>12 mg/dL (2%). In 6 patients (33.3%), serum corrected

calcium levels between 11 mg/dL and 12 mg/dL were
detected on 1 or more occasions, and, in 4 of those
patients (22.2%), calcium levels >12 mg/dL were
detected. All patients had normal baseline calcium levels
(8-10.5 mg/dL). According to the protocol, treatment
was held for a serum calcium level >14.0 mg/dL (corrected). Calcium levels were assessed weekly, and calcitriol
was resumed at 50% of the previous dose when calcium
levels returned to <10.5 mg/dL. No patient met this criterion. For unmanageable grade 3 toxicity, treatment was
held until the toxicity resolved to grade 1, and calcitriol
was resumed. Only 1 episode of grade 3 hypercalcemia
was noted: The serum calcium level in that patient was
12.2 mg/dL. Treatment was held for 7 days and then was
resumed.
Serum Creatinine
In 4 patients, serum creatinine levels of 1.5 to 2 times the
upper limit of normal (0.8-1.5 mg/dL) were noted. Two
of those patients also had hypercalcemia (11.6 mg/dL and

2136

12.2 mg/dL), which preceded the increase in creatinine by
7 days and 27 days, respectively. The other 2 patients had
high creatinine levels (2.7 mg/dL and 2.1 mg/dL) that
preceded increased calcium levels (by 7 days and 14 days,
respectively). In 2 of those patients, the increased creatinine levels resolved in 7 days. In the other 2 patients, the
increased creatinine levels did not resolve before the
patients went off study because of disease progression. No
patient developed nephrolithiasis. Drug administration
was held if the serum creatinine level reached 2 times
the baseline level or >2.5 mg/dL. Treatment could be
reinitiated if the creatinine level recovered to <1.5 times
the baseline level or <2.0 mg/dL.
Hyperglycemia
Five patients had hyperglycemia greater than grade 2 that
was attributed to dexamethasone. This toxicity may have
been overestimated, because patients were not required to
be fasting at the time of blood draws. One episode of
grade 4 hyperglycemia was noted in a diabetic patient.
The median time from the last dexamethasone dose was
7 days (range, 7-21 days). Hyperglycemia resolved in all
5 patients in a median of 7 days after onset (range, 7-42
days after onset).
PSA Dynamics
PSA dynamics were studied in post hoc analyses. Eight
patients (44.4%) had a decrease in their PSA from baseline during treatment; whereas, in the remaining
10 patients, the PSA increased. One patient had a 59%
decrease in PSA from baseline; this decrease was not persistent for more than 1 month. Of the patients who had a
decrease in PSA, the median best decrease in PSA was
25.4% (range, 2.2%-59.0%). Figure 1 depicts the best

response in PSA from baseline in the patients on study.
There was no significant difference in the slope of log
(PSA þ 1) before and after treatment (P ¼ .4590, 2-sided
test; P ¼ .2295, 1-sided test). The estimated difference
between the slope after and before treatment was
0.04158.

DISCUSSION
Considerable epidemiologic data suggest that there may
be an etiologic role of vitamin D in prostate cancer.33-37
Preclinical studies indicate that calcitriol has considerable
antitumor activity in prostate cancer and other tumor
types and acts as an antiproliferative agent, induces apoptosis, and has antiangiogenic properties.10-17
Limited data suggest that vitamin D alone has therapeutic value in prostate cancer. In a pilot study, Woo et al
demonstrated prolongation of PSA doubling time after
commencing cholecalciferol in men who had a PSA
relapse after definitive therapy.38 In an open-label, nonrandomized pilot study of calcitriol among men with early
recurrent prostate cancer, Gross et al observed that calcitriol slowed the rate of PSA rise compared with the pretreatment rate.39 Osborn et al reported a trial of calcitriol
in patients with CRPC in which oral calcitriol was given
daily (dose, 1.0-1.5 lg).40 No responses were noted in
that study, and a 30% frequency of hypercalcemia was
encountered. Because of these initial studies, we and
others have demonstrated that intermittent, high-dose
calcitriol regimens are safe and feasible.27,41,42 Our group
has observed that high-dose oral calcitriol (12 lg) in
patients with CRPC administered on Days 1,2, and 3
each week in combination with dexamethasone 4 mg on
Days 0, 1, 2, and 3 each week was well tolerated and

produced a response rate of 19% according to PSA criterion (a PSA decline 50% that persisted for 28 days).
This response rate is not clearly superior to what would be
expected from dexamethasone alone at this dose and
schedule.23,25,26
In preclinical models, both in vitro and in vivo exposure to very high concentrations of calcitriol are necessary
to produce antitumor effects. A shortcoming of all previous studies of vitamin D-based therapies is that calcitriol
and the other analogues that were studied were used at
doses well below the MTD, as determined in our trial of
iv calcitriol. Muindi et al demonstrated that the exposure
achieved in patients (area under the curve and maximum
concentration) was only 20% to 33% of the exposure that
was identified as necessary to produce activity in preclinical models.43
Before the work of Fakih et al,24 to our knowledge,
no study had ever determined an MTD for calcitriol in
humans using an intermittent schedule. In the current
study, we used a dose regimen that proved to be very safe
and well tolerated. It should be noted, however, that this
dose and schedule were inconvenient. With the 1-lg
ampule, 74 ampules must be used for each weekly dose in
this regimen. Despite administration of the highest dose
of intermittent calcitriol ever given in a phase 2 trial in
any disease, no clear antitumor effects were noted. Possible explanations include the following: 1) The calcitriol
dose still may have been insufficient, and exposure of tumor cells may not have been comparable to in vivo studies. Given the safety of this regimen, we believe that
further dose escalation is possible. Fakih et al studied
high-dose, iv calcitriol in combination with dexamethasone and gefitinib. A fixed oral dose of 4 mg dexamethasone daily was given every 12 hours for 3 doses starting

2137

Original Article

12 hours before iv calcitriol administration. Gefitinib was
given at a fixed oral daily dose of 250 mg starting in Week
2. The combination of calcitriol (weekly iv) and dexamethasone had an MTD for calcitriol of 125 lg per week.
This dose was safe and well tolerated, and it consistently
achieved the high systemic calcitriol exposure that was
associated with antitumor activity in preclinical models.44
It is conceivable that even higher doses of calcitriol might
be administered alone or in combination with other
agents. Although there are no data directly assessing this
issue, our determination of an MTD in this iv calcitriol
study may have been complicated further by the administration of gefitinib. 2) PSA may not be a valid endpoint,
especially for a drug like as calcitriol. 3) Calcitriol resistance mechanisms are unclear and include, at the least, loss
of vitamin D receptor and enhanced calcitriol degradation
by CYP24. It is possible that patients may be selected for
responsive phenotype based on these or other parameters.
In addition, other modalities are available to reduce the
likelihood of hypercalcemia (bisphosphonates, excluding
patients who have a predilection to develop hypercalcemia) and may allow further dose escalation.
Although the meaning of SD in this setting is conjectural, it is noteworthy that, among 12 patients with
CRPC whose best ‘‘response’’ was SD, the median duration of SD was 147 days; and, in 2 patients, calcitriol was
continued for approximately 1 year (412 days and 306
days), because PSA did not rise >25% over baseline during this period. After study closure, these 2 patients continued on the drug for a total of 744 days and 329 days,
respectively.
We believe that vitamin D may have a role in cancer
treatment. Better understanding of responsive phenotypes
and potential combination with cytotoxic drugs are promising avenues for the future use of vitamin D in cancer
therapy.
