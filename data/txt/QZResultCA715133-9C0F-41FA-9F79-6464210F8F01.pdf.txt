BACKGROUND: Surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy has been standard treatment for stage III colon cancer
since 1990. However, to date, clinical trials have not been conducted to determine the definitive outer time limit by
which adjuvant chemotherapy should be received for optimal survival benefit. The objective of the current study was
to assess the association between the receipt/timing of adjuvant chemotherapy and patient survival in clinical practice. METHODS: Residents of Alberta who were diagnosed with stage III colon adenocarcinoma in years 2000 to
2005 who underwent surgery were included in the study. Patients were identified from the Alberta Cancer Registry
and were linked to hospital data and neighborhood-level socioeconomic data from the 2001 Canadian Census. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios of death according to the timing of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: There were 1053 patients in the study; 648 (61%) initiated adjuvant chemotherapy within 16 weeks of surgery. There was no difference in overall survival or colon cancer-specific survival between those who received adjuvant chemotherapy from 8 to 12 weeks postsurgery compared with those who received it within 8 weeks. However,
those who received chemotherapy 12 to 16 weeks after surgery and those who either received it >16 weeks after surgery or received no treatment had a 43% and 107% greater risk of dying, respectively, than those who received chemotherapy within 8 weeks of surgery (hazard ratio, 1.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.96-2.13] and hazard ratio, 2.07
[95% confidence interval, 1.56-2.76], respectively). Analyses were controlled for age, year, and region of residence at
diagnosis; sex; neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors; and number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: The results
from this study were consistent with current guideline recommendations in Alberta that patients with stage III adenoC 2011 American

In the early 1990s, guidelines were developed recommending that patients with stage III colon cancer receive chemotherapy after their surgery (ie, adjuvant chemotherapy).1 These guidelines were based on large, randomized studies conducted
in the United States that demonstrated relative risk reductions of 33% for mortality and 40% for disease recurrence in
patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who underwent surgery alone.2 A large, populationbased study conducted in the United States that included patients aged 65 years with stage III colon cancer recently
reported that adjuvant chemotherapy initiated 3 months after surgery was associated with a 50% increase in colon cancer-specific mortality compared with initiating chemotherapy within 1 month.3 The guideline treatment for stage III colon cancer in Alberta consists of surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy initiated within 12 weeks from the date of
surgery.4
Regardless of the benefits and survival advantage gained by adjuvant chemotherapy, several studies have demonstrated that large proportions of patients do not receive it or experience treatment delays.5-9 The objectives of the current

study were 1) to quantify the proportion of patients
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy within 12 weeks after
surgery, 2) to identify factors associated with the receipt of
timely adjuvant chemotherapy, and 3) to assess the association between the receipt and timing of initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy and survival among patients who were
diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in Alberta between
2000 and 2005.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria
All residents of Alberta who were diagnosed with stage III
colon adenocarcinoma (International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology [ICD-O] 10th edition10 codes c18
and c18.2-c18.9) between 2000 and 2005 who underwent
surgery were identified from the Alberta Cancer Registry.
Patients were excluded if they died within 16 weeks of
their surgery, were diagnosed with another primary cancer
within 6 months before or after their colon cancer diagnosis, did not have histologically confirmed disease, or were
treated outside of Alberta. Cancer staging was based on
the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) AJCC
Cancer Staging Manual (version 6).11
Data Sources
Data were linked from the Alberta Cancer Registry, the
Ambulatory Care Classification System (ACCS), the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), and the 2001 Canadian
census. The Alberta Cancer Registry (a member of the
North American Association of Comprehensive Cancer
registries) was established in 1942 and is responsible for
recording and maintaining data on all cancer cases and
cancer deaths that occur in Alberta; physicians and hospitals are legally required to report all cancer cases to the
Alberta Cancer Registry. Patient demographics, tumor
histology and stage, postal code of residence at diagnosis,
initial treatment modalities and start dates, and date of
death were obtained from the Alberta Cancer Registry.
Date and cause of death are received and updated monthly
from the provincial vital statistics office. All death certificates are reviewed by the Alberta Cancer Registry to confirm cause of death using coding rules from version 10 of
the ICD for cause of death12; corrections are made to
cause of death as appropriate.
The ACCS and DAD databases contain diagnosis
and procedure codes on all outpatient and inpatient hospital visits in the province of Alberta. All hospital visits
that occurred in the year before the patient’s cancer diag-

3834

nosis were used to identify comorbidities using an
enhancement to the Charleson Comorbidity Index.13
Comorbidity scores were categorized into 3 groups: no serious comorbidity, 1 serious comorbidity, and 2 serious
comorbidities.
The 2001 Canadian census was used to obtain socioeconomic indicators at the geographic level for each
patient, also called the dissemination area (a neighborhood with approximately 600 households). Four variables
were used as measures of the neighborhood socioeconomic status: 1) median income; 2) proportion of
employment; 3) proportion separated, divorced, or widowed; and 4) proportion not graduated from high school.

Statistical Analysis
Exploratory data analysis was performed to determine cutoff levels for categorical variables. Descriptive statistics
were calculated for the overall cohort with respect to
patient and clinical characteristics. Chi-square or Fisher
exact tests, as appropriate, were used to assess associations
between patient/clinical characteristics and the timing of
receiving chemotherapy. The patient and clinical characteristics that were evaluated included sex, age at diagnosis,
region of residence at diagnosis, neighborhood socioeconomic factors, number of comorbidities, and year of
diagnosis.
Time from the date of surgery to the date of first
chemotherapy session was calculated, and patients were
categorized into the following 4 groups for survival analysis: received chemotherapy 1) within 8 weeks after surgery,
2) 8 to 12 weeks after surgery, 3) 12 to 16 weeks after surgery, or 4) no treatment within 16 weeks. The last group
originally was separated into ‘‘received chemotherapy
>16 weeks’’ and ‘‘never received chemotherapy.’’ In the
final analysis, these 2 groups were combined, because the
hazard ratios (HRs) for these 2 groups relative to the reference group (<8 weeks) were very similar.
Kaplan-Meier curves were used to describe the
patient survival stratified by time from surgery to adjuvant
chemotherapy. Cumulative incidence curves were used to
describe the cumulative mortality from colon cancer-specific deaths, treating the other causes of death as competing risk.14 The Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence
curves were started at 16 weeks after surgery. This starting
time was the earliest time point that allowed us to define
all ‘‘time from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy’’ groups
before the starting time: Deaths before this starting time
were not included in the analysis.

Timing of Treatment and Survival/Lima et al

Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the adjusted colon cancer-specific and overall mortality HRs according to the time from surgery to adjuvant
chemotherapy (time-dependent covariate) starting at 16
weeks after surgery. The following covariates were
included in the Cox regression models to adjust for relevant factors related to survival to produce adjusted HR
estimates for the time-to-adjuvant-treatment variable: sex,
age at diagnosis, region of residence at diagnosis, number
of comorbidities, year of diagnosis, and neighborhoodlevel socioeconomic factors. To closely adjust for age at diagnosis, a natural cubic spline of age at diagnosis was used
with 4 knots.15 P values for the time to adjuvant chemotherapy and year of diagnosis were calculated based on a
trend test with 1 degree of freedom. Patients were followed to the earlier of death or March 31, 2009. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical
software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R
(version 2.9; R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).

RESULTS
There were 1211 residents of Alberta diagnosed with stage
III colon cancer between 2000 and 2005. The following
patients were excluded from the study: Eighty-two
patients died within 16 weeks of their surgery, 52 patients
were diagnosed with another cancer within 6 months
before or after their diagnosis, 6 patients did not have histologic confirmation of their disease, 14 patients had a
histology other than adenocarcinoma, 2 patients did not
undergo surgery, and 2 patients were treated outside of
Alberta. The remaining 1053 patients were included in
the study.
Table 1 lists the demographic, clinical, and neighborhood characteristics of the 1053 patients who were
included in the study stratified by time from surgery to
the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. It also indicates
the proportion of patients that received treatment and
the proportion that died during the study follow-up.
Overall, 648 patients (61%) with stage III colon cancer
received adjuvant chemotherapy within 16 weeks after
undergoing surgery, and 45% died during the study follow-up. The minimum time to chemotherapy after surgery was 24 days, and the maximum was 260 days.
Twenty patients received adjuvant chemotherapy >16
weeks postsurgery; the primary reason for delays in this
group was because of time needed to evaluate the possibility of metastases (eg, a delay in obtaining a computed

tomography scan). Patients aged 65 years and patients
with comorbidities were less likely to receive adjuvant
chemotherapy. Patients who received chemotherapy >12
weeks postsurgery were more likely to live in neighborhoods with a high percentage of divorced, separated, or
widowed; a low employment rate; and a low median
household income. In addition, this group had more
comorbidities compared with patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy within 12 weeks of surgery. The Edmonton area had the highest proportion of patients who
received adjuvant chemotherapy within 12 weeks after
surgery.
Figures 1 and 2 provide the Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence curves for overall survival and colon
cancer-specific mortality, respectively, according to the
time from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy. The risk of
death was greater for patients who received adjuvant
chemotherapy >12 weeks postsurgery compared with
those who received it within 12 weeks postsurgery for
both overall and colon cancer-specific mortality.
Table 2 provides the adjusted overall and colon cancer-specific mortality HRs and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for patients with stage III colon
cancer according to the timing of adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no difference in the overall or colon cancer-specific mortality hazard for patients who received
chemotherapy 8 to 12 weeks after surgery compared with
those who received it within 8 weeks after surgery.
Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy 12 to 16
weeks after surgery had a 1.43 times higher mortality hazard compared with those who received the treatment
within 8 weeks (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.96-2.13). The
same treatment group was associated with an 18%
increase in the hazard of colon cancer-specific mortality
(HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.75-1.85), although the hazard was
not statistically significant: However, the test for trend
was highly statistically significant (P < .001). Patients
who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy within 16
weeks postsurgery had more than a 2-fold hazard of death
compared with those who received it within 8 weeks
(HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.56-2.76) and had a 76% increase
in the hazard of colon cancer-specific mortality (HR,
1.76; 95% CI, 1.28-2.42).

DISCUSSION
The objectives of this study were to identify how the timing of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery was distributed, to identify factors associated with the timely receipt

of adjuvant chemotherapy, and to determine whether the
receipt and timing of adjuvant chemotherapy were associated with survival in patients who were diagnosed with
stage III colon cancer in Alberta after adjusting for other
factors. Seventy-four percent of patients aged 75 years
and 76% of patients with 2 serious comorbidities did
not receive adjuvant chemotherapy within 16 weeks postsurgery. This is a surprising finding, because the current
study was under a publicly funded healthcare system, and
standard treatment guidelines had been in existence for 10
to 15 years at the time these patients were diagnosed.
Clinical trials and observational studies have indicated
that older patients and those with comorbidities benefit
from adjuvant chemotherapy.16-19 Gross et al. observed
that, based on 5-year survival, the benefit of adjuvant
chemotherapy does not change regardless of the number
of chronic health conditions in an individual patient.20
Another study that surveyed a nationally representative
sample of 1000 general surgeons and 1000 oncologists in
the United States, however, indicated that both types of
physicians hesitate to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy
to patients aged >72 years or with comorbidities who
have stage III colon cancer.21 Efforts are need to address
treatment disparities in these patient populations. A study
similar to ours that used National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry
data also indicated that the receipt of chemotherapy 12
weeks after surgery is the outer limit at which the maxi-

Cancer

mum survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is
reached.3
In Alberta, chemotherapy is organized and managed
centrally; before receiving chemotherapy, patients must
have a consultation with an oncologist. Treatment guidelines are created by the appropriate provincial tumor
group using the best available knowledge. The treatment
guidelines for patients with stage III colon cancer state
that adjuvant chemotherapy should begin within 12
weeks after surgery.4 Our results are consistent with those
guidelines. However, in the current study, a large portion
of patients (46%) did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy
or received delayed treatment. We reported this finding
previously and identified the factors related to not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.6 A significant finding was
that 20% of all patients who were diagnosed with stage III
colon cancer were not referred to an oncologist postsurgery; thus, potentially clinically eligible patients did not
have the opportunity to receive adjuvant chemotherapy.6
In addition, in the current study, of the 20 patients who
received adjuvant chemotherapy >16 weeks after surgery,
the delay for 8 of those patients (40%) was because of system delays (eg, delays in obtaining postsurgical computed
tomography scans to confirm the absence of metastatic
disease).
Further investigations to identify the reasons for the
large proportion of patients who do not receive adjuvant
chemotherapy, however, still are needed to optimize
patient outcomes. The physician may delay chemotherapy

Timing of Treatment and Survival/Lima et al

because of slow recovery from surgery, postsurgery complications, or possibly a change in the patient’s decision to
receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Alternatively, delays may
occur because of inefficiencies in the healthcare system or
shortages of resources to deliver care. The variation in
treatment by geographic region and the findings from our
initial investigations are consistent with the latter possibilities. Currently, we are investigating referral patterns to
oncologists and treatment patterns of oncologists to determine whether there is practice variation that could be
addressed. We also are conducting a chart review to clarify
and quantify reasons why patients do not receive chemotherapy if they have a consultation with an oncologist. We
are engaging the surgical and oncology communities in
these initiatives to positively affect change with respect to
both the receipt and the timely receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, and we are investigating the unexpected finding
of an increasing trend in adjusted mortality hazards over
years.
The strengths of this study are that it is populationbased and includes all patients who were diagnosed in the
province of Alberta over a 6-year period with 4 to 9 years
of follow-up. These strengths make the findings robust
and generalizable. Only a clinical trial, however, can
directly evaluate the effect timing of treatment has on survival. The intent of the study, however, was not to replace
a clinical trial but, rather, to assess the association between
treatment (and its timing) and survival in a real clinical
practice setting and in a population-based manner. Other
limitations of the study are that we did not have treatment
details, such as completeness of the regimen or the specific
chemotherapy regimens received. Clinical factors that
were unavailable and also may affect patient survival were
surgical complications, the number of positive lymph
nodes, grade, and patient’s functional status.
In conclusion, the results from our study are consistent with current guidelines for the treatment of stage III
colon cancer in Alberta: surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy that begins within 12 weeks after surgery. Forty-six
percent of the patients who were diagnosed between 2000
and 2005, however, did not receive chemotherapy or did
not receive it within 12 weeks after surgery. Efforts are
needed to improve the uptake and initiation of adjuvant
chemotherapy within 12 weeks after surgery to maximize
the survival of patients with stage III colon cancer.
