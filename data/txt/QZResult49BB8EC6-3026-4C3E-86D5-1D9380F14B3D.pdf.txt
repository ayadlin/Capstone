Abstract
A truncated version of retinoid X receptor-a, tRXR-a, promotes cancer cell survival by activating the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. However, targeting the tRXR-a–mediated survival pathway
for cancer treatment remains to be explored. We report here our identiﬁcation of a new natural product molecule,
CF31, a xanthone isolated from Cratoxylum formosum ssp. pruniﬂorum, and the biologic evaluation of its
regulation of the tRXR-a–mediated PI3K/AKT pathway. CF31 binds RXR-a and its binding results in inhibition of
RXR-a transactivation. Through RXR-a mutational analysis and computational studies, we show that Arg316 of
RXR-a, known to form salt bridges with certain RXR-a ligands, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), is not
required for the antagonist effect of CF31, showing a distinct binding mode. Evaluation of several CF31 analogs
suggests that the antagonist effect is mainly attributed to an interference with Leu451 of helix H12 in RXR-a. CF31
is a potent inhibitor of AKT activation in various cancer cell lines. When combined with TNF-a, it suppresses TNFa activation of AKT by inhibiting TNF-a–induced tRXR-a interaction with the p85a regulatory subunit of PI3K.
CF31 inhibition of TNF-a activation of AKT also results in TNF-a–dependent activation of caspase-8 and
apoptosis. Together, our results show that CF31 is an effective converter of TNF-a signaling from survival to death
by targeting tRXR-a in a unique mode and suggest that identiﬁcation of a natural product that targets an RXRmediated cell survival pathway that regulates PI3K/AKT may offer a new therapeutic strategy to kill cancer cells.

Introduction
Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-a, a unique member of the
nuclear receptor superfamily, regulates diverse biologic processes, including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and
immune response, and ligands for RXR-a show promise as
therapeutic agents for many diseases, such as cancer (1–4).
Alterations in the expression and function of RXR-a are
implicated in the development of a number of diseases and
cancer. Targeted disruption of RXR-a gene leads to prostatic
preneoplastic lesions (5) and skin abnormalities (6). Dysregulation of RXR-a function by phosphorylation is associated

with the development of human liver cancer (7) and colon
cancer (8). Levels of RXR-a protein are often reduced in
cancer cells and tumor tissues (9–14), suggesting that
diminished RXR-a expression is associated with the development of certain malignancies. Numerous studies have
shown that proteolytic cleavage of RXR-a protein is primarily responsible for its diminished levels in tumor cells and
represents an important mechanism controlling the function and activities of RXR-a (13–18). Recent studies have
shown that RXR-a binding to PML/RAR-a is essential for the
development of acute promeylocytic leukemia (19, 20), further showing the oncogenic potential of this protein when it
acts inappropriately.
Although signiﬁcant progress has been made, how RXR-a
regulates cancer cell growth and how its ligands suppress
tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. Like other nuclear
receptors, RXR-a interacts with DNA to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-dependent manner (1–4). Aside
from its role in DNA binding and transactivation, accumulating
evidence indicates that RXR-a also has extranuclear nongenomic actions (15, 21–24). RXR-a resides in the cytoplasm at
certain stages during development (25, 26). It migrates from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to differentiation (23),
apoptosis (21), and inﬂammation (22, 24). Cytoplasmic localization of RXR-a facilitates nuclear export of its heterodimerization partner Nur77, leading to Bcl-2 conversion and apoptosis (21, 27, 28).

We showed recently that proteolytic cleavage of RXR-a
results in production of truncated RXR-a protein, tRXR-a,
which acquires new function that is different from the fulllength RXR-a (29). Unlike the full-length RXR-a that resides in
the nucleus, tRXR-a is cytoplasmic and interacts with the p85a
subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in a TNFa–dependent manner, leading to activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, a
major survival pathway important for uncontrolled growth of
tumor and as drug resistance (29). Activation of the PI3K/AKT
pathway by tRXR-a contributes signiﬁcantly to anchorageindependent growth of cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth
in animals (29), offering an opportunity to suppress cancer cell
growth by targeting the tRXR-a–mediated PI3K/AKT pathway.
Epidemiologic studies have shown that dietary phytochemicals provide beneﬁcial effects for cancer prevention, and
among them, xanthones are of great interest as cancer chemopreventive agents because of their potent antioxidative and
anticancer activity (30–33). We previously puriﬁed a series of
xanthones from a medicinal plant, Cratoxylum formosum ssp.
pruniﬂorum, which belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is
widely distributed in several Southeast Asian countries (34, 35).
Here, we report our identiﬁcation of one of the xanthones,
CF31, which suppresses tRXR-a–dependent AKT activation
through its unique RXR-a binding. CF31, when combined with
TNF-a inhibits TNF-a–induced tRXR-a–p85a interaction and
AKT activation. Moreover, the CF31 and TNF-a combination
results in synergistic induction of TNF-a–dependent caspase-8
activation and apoptosis in cancer cells. Thus, CF31 represents
a new modulator of the tRXR-a survival pathway and a potent
converter of TNF-a signaling from survival to death.

Materials and Methods
Isolation of natural products
Compounds CF31, also called cochinchinone B or 1,3,6,7tetrahydroxy-2-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-5-(3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienyl)xanthone (36), CF13 (1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-geranylxanthone),
and CF26 (pruniﬂorone Q) were isolated from the stems of
Cratoxylum formosum ssp. pruniﬂorum as described (35).
Plasmids
The pGAL4-RXR-a-LBD plasmid was obtained by inserting
RXR-a ligand-binding domain (LBD) sequence (amino acids
198–462) in-frame with the Gal4 DBD coding sequence in the
pBIND vector (Promega).
Antibodies and regents
Antibodies for phospho-AKT (Ser473, D9E) and cleaved
caspase-8 (p43/p41; Cell Signaling); Bax (6A7; Sigma-Aldrich);
p85a (Millipore); AKT1 (C-20), actin, c-Myc (9E10), RXR-a
(DN197), RXR-a (D20), and PARP (H-250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Caspase-3 and -8 activity assay kits were
from Biovision.
Stable transfections
GFP-RXR-a/D80 was stably transfected into SW480, HepG2,
andMCF-7 cells to obtain SW480/RXR-a/D80, HepG2/RXRa/D80, and MCF-7/RXR-a/D80, respectively.

Ligand-binding assay
RXR-a LBD was incubated with [3H]-9-cis-RA in the presence or absence of unlabeled 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) or
CF31. Bound [3H]-9-cis-RA in RXR-a. LBD protein was determined in a scintillation counter (29).
Transient transfection and reporter assays
CV-1 green monkey kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter assays, cells
were seeded at 5  104 cells per well in 24-well plates and
transfected with 50 ng TREpal-tk-CAT reporter plasmid (37),
20 ng b-galactosidase expression vector (pCH 110; Amersham),
20 ng RXR-a expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Cells were then treated with CF31 at different
dose for 20 hours. CAT activity was normalized with b-galactosidase activity. For luciferase reporter assay, 24 hours after
transfected with pGL5 luciferase reporter vector (40 ng/well)
and pGAL4-RXR-a-LBD expression vector (40 ng/well), cells
were incubated with varied concentrations of compounds for
12 hours. Luciferase activities were measured using the DualLuciferase Assay System Kit (Promega).
Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations
AutoDock version 4.0 was used for the docking screening.
The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was selected for ligand
conformational searching. Docking parameters were as follows: grid box of 40 Å  40 Å  40 Å, xyz-coordinates of
gridcenter: 49.192 63.991 7.523, population size of 150, random starting position and conformation, translation step
ranges of 2 Å, rotation step ranges of 50 , elitism of 1, mutation
rate of 0.02, cross-over rate of 0.8, local search rate of 0.06, and
2.5 million energy evaluations. Molecular dynamics simulations were adopted to sample possible conﬁgurations of each
RXR-a LBD complex using the AMBER (version 7.0) program
(38). To set up each molecular dynamics simulation, the
electrostatic potentials of the ligand was computed by using
the Gaussian 98 package at the HF/6-31G level. Atom-centered partial charges were derived by using the Restrained
Electrostatic potential method implemented in the AMBER
package.
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
HepG2 cells mounted on glass slides were permeabilized
with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mol/L glycine
for 15 minutes, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in
PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then
incubated with primary antibody [anti-Bax (6A7; 1:500)] at
37 C for 1 hour and detected by anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G
(IgG) conjugated with Cy3 (1:400) at room temperature for 30
minutes. Cells were costained with 40 60 -diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize nuclei. The images were taken using
LSM-510 confocal laser scanning microscope system (Carl
Zeiss).
Western blotting
Equal amounts of the lysates were electrophoresed on 8%
SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride

membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat
milk in Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20 [50 mmol/L Tris–
HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20] for 1 hour,
incubated with various primary antibodies for 2 hours and
detected with either anti-rabbit (1:5,000) or anti-mouse
(1:5,000) secondary antibodies for 1 hour, all of which were
undertaken under room temperature. The ﬁnal immunoreactive products were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system.
Caspase activity assay
Caspase activities were determined by a colorimetric assay
based on the ability of caspase-3 and -8 to change acetyl–Asp–
Glu–Val–Asp p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA) and acetyl–Ile–
Glu–Thr–Asp p-nitroanilide Ac-IETD-pNA) into a yellow
formazan product [p-nitroaniline (pNA)], respectively. After
treatment with CF31 and/or TNF-a, lysates were prepared and
assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Biovision
Research Products).
RXR-a siRNA
RXR-a siRNA siGENOME SMARTpool (M-003443-02) and
siRNA Nonspeciﬁc Control IX (D-001206-09-05) were from
DHARMACON, and they were transfected into cells by RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen).
Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays
Cells extracts were cleared by incubation with the Protein
A/G plus Agarose beads and then incubated with appropriate
antibody and 30 mL of Protein A/G plus Agarose beads overnight at 4 C. Immunoreactive products were detected by
chemiluminescence with an ECL system (Amersham).
Colony formation assay
HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plate (500 cells/well) for 5
days, treated with CF31 in 0.5% serum medium for 3 days, and
ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Colonies were stained with
0.1% crystal violet.
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using an analysis of variance or Student
test and were presented as the mean  SEM of triplicate.

Results
CF31 binds to RXR-a
To identify new agents for regulating the tRXRa survival
pathway, we screened a natural product library prepared from
Chinese Herbal Medicine for compounds capable of regulating
RXR-a transcriptional function. For this purpose, transient
transfection assays using a CAT reporter containing TREpal
capable of binding to RXR-a homodimer (37) were used.
Compounds were evaluated for their effect on TREpal activity
in the absence or presence of 9-cis-RA, the natural RXR ligand
known to induce the formation of RXR-a homodimer and its
activation of TREpal (37). Among compounds that were identiﬁed to modulate RXR-a activity, CF31 (Fig. 1A), which was
prepared from Cratoxylum formosum ssp. Pruniﬂorum (35),
potently inhibited 9-cis-RA–induced TREpal-reporter activity
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). CF31 at 10 mmol/L

www.aacrjournals.org

showed a similar inhibitory effect when compared with BI1003
(1 mmol/L), a known RXR-a antagonist (39). To further study
the inhibitory effect of CF31, we cloned the LBD of RXR-a as a
Gal4 fusion, and used the resulting Gal4-RXR-a/LBD chimera
and Gal4 reporter system to evaluate the inhibitory effect of
CF31. Gal4-RXR-a/LBD strongly activated the Gal4 reporter in
the presence of 9-cis-RA, which was inhibited by 1 mmol/L
UVI3003, another RXR-a antagonist (40; Fig. 1C). Similar to
UVI3003, treatment of cells with CF31 resulted in inhibition of
9-cis-RA–induced reporter activity in a CF31 dose-dependent
manner. Because UVI3003 was derived from a potent and
selective RXR-a agonist CD3254 (40), the effect of CF31 on
CD3254-induced RXR-a activity was also evaluated. CD3254
strongly induced Gal4-RXR-a/LBD activity, which was comparable with that induced by 9-cis-RA. Interestingly, CD3254induced reporter activity was similarly inhibited by UVI3003
and CF31 (Fig. 1C). We next determined whether CF31 could
bind to RXR-a. Thus, a ligand competition assay with [3H]9-cisRA binding to RXR-a LBD was used. While unlabeled 9-cis-RA
was able to efﬁciently displace [3H]9-cis-RA from binding to
RXR-a LBD with an IC50 of 7.6 nmol/L, CF31 displaced [3H]9cis-RA with an IC50 of 9.6 mmol/L (Fig. 1D). Together, our data
show that CF31 acts as a RXR-a antagonist by binding to the
RXR-a LBD.
Arg316 is not required for the antagonist effect of CF31
Molecular conformation analyses showed there was a
large degree of structural overlapping between CF31 and
LG100754 (Fig. 2A), an antagonist of RAR-a/RXR-a heterodimer (41). This suggested that CF31 might bind to the
antagonist form of the RXR-a LBD. However, CF31, unlike
many natural and synthetic RXR-a ligands, lacks a carboxylate moiety known to form salt bridges with Arg316 in the
L-shaped RXRa ligand-binding pocket (LBP; refs. 41–43). To
understand how CF31 binds RXR-a, a docking study using
the antagonist structure of the RXR-a LBD in complex with
LG100754 (41) was conducted. CF31 docked well with a good
score to the RXRa antagonist conformation. Superposing
the docked conﬁguration of CF31 and the crystal structure of
LG100754 showed that their scaffold orientations were
highly conserved (Fig. 2A). An interesting difference, however, is that while the carboxylate group of LG100754 made a
strong salt bridge with Arg316 in helix H5, CF31 could not
form such a bridge (Fig. 2B).
To study the requirement of Arg316 in CF31 binding, Arg316
was replaced with Glu, and the resulting mutant RXR-a/R316E
was evaluated for its activation by 9-cis-RA and CD3254. As
shown in Fig. 2C, mutation of Arg316 completely abolished the
effect of 9-cis-RA on activating the Gal4 reporter. In contrast,
CD3254 could still activate the RXR-a/R316E mutant. Thus,
while Arg316 is capable of establishing an ionic interaction
with the carboxylate group of 9-cis-RA (43), it fails to form salt
bridges with CD3254 (40). Consistently, our computational
analysis showed that 9-cis-RA formed 2 shorter hydrogen
bonds (2.098 Å and 2.423 Å) with Arg316 than those formed
with CD3254 (2.901 Å and 2.553 Å; Fig. 2D). Therefore, Arg316
plays a more important role in the binding of 9-cis-RA than
that of CD3254. We then studied whether CF31 could inhibit

CD3254-induced RXRa/R316E activity. When RXR-a/R316E
was cotransfected with the Gal4 reporter, CD3254-induced
reporter activity was potently inhibited by CF31 in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2C), showing that Arg316 was not
required for CF31 binding.
To identify which amino acid residues in the RXR-a LBP
were key to CF31 binding, we used the Molecular Mechanics
Poisson–Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PB/SA) method (44)
to evaluate binding free energy of CF31 in complex with the
RXRa LBP. For comparison, 9-cis-RA was also studied. Our
examination of the interaction spectrum of CF31 with
amino acid residues in the RXR-a LBP with that of 9-cisRA revealed that Arg316 was indeed mainly responsible for
the binding of 9-cis-RA but not CF31 (Fig. 2E; Supplementary Table S1). However, CF31 made considerable contacts
with several amino acid residues in the RXR-a LBP, including Val265 and Ile268 in H3, Ile310 and Phe313 in H5, V342,
I345, F346 in H7, and Leu436 in H11 (Fig. 2E). Thus, the
nonpolar van der Waals interactions of CF31 with the
hydrophobic residues in the RXRa LBP may serve to stabilize the binding of CF31, revealing its distinct mode of
RXRa binding.

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

In an attempt to gain more understanding of the antagonist
effect of CF31, we evaluated 2 additional xanthones isolated
from Cratoxylum formosum ssp. pruniﬂorum, CF13 and CF26
(Fig. 3A), for their antagonist effect (Fig. 3B). While CF13 had no
inhibitory effect of 9-cis-RA–induced RXR-a transactivation,
the inhibitory effect of CF26 was even stronger than that of
CF31 (Fig. 3B). Modeling studies suggested that a potential
steric hindrance between side chain of Leu451 in H12 and
substituent at position 3 of ring A of these compounds might
mediate their antagonist effect (Fig. 3C). The size of the
substituent correlated well with their antagonist effect, with
3-methyl-2-butenyl in CF26 being the most effective.
CF31 inhibits AKT activation
In the ﬁrst step to study the effect of CF31 on tRXRa–
dependent AKT survival pathway, we determined whether
CF31 could regulate AKT activation. Figure 4A shows that
CF31 dose-dependently inhibited the activation of AKT in HeLa
cells, revealed by its inhibition of the expression of phosphoAKT but not total AKT using Western blotting. Time-course
analysis showed that the inhibition of AKT activation by CF31
was observed when cells were treated by 10 mmol/L CF31 for as

CF31 also closely correlated with apoptosis induction as shown
by enhanced cleavage of PARP protein (Figs. 4A and B).
The ability of CF31 to inhibit AKT activation prompted us to
examine the effect of CF31 on the survival of HeLa cells by
colonogenic survival assays. Treatment of cells with CF31 for 3
days completely inhibited colony formation of HeLa cells,
which was as effective as K-80003, a sulindac analog that
inhibits AKT activation through its binding to tRXR-a (29).
In contrast, sulindac showed little effect under the same
conditions (Fig. 4C). We also determined whether CF31 inhibition of AKT activation could enhance the apoptotic response
of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. To this end, we examined
the death effect of the topoisomerase-I inhibitor camptothecine (CPT), which has shown signiﬁcant antitumor activity
across a broad spectrum of human tumors (45) in the presence

or absence of CF31 in HepG2 liver cancer cells. Immunoblotting showed that PARP cleavage induced by camptothecine
was signiﬁcantly enhanced when cells were cotreated with
CF31, whereas CF31 alone had undetectable effect on PARP
cleavage under the conditions used (Fig. 4D). When cells were
transfected with RXR-a siRNA, the enhancing effect of CF31
was impaired. Thus, CF31 may sensitize cancer cells to the
apoptotic effect of certain anticancer drugs through its inhibition of AKT activation.
Antagonist effect of CF31 on TNF-a activation of AKT
TNF-a, a multifunctional cytokine, can activate AKT in a
tRXR-a–dependent manner in certain cancer cells (29). In
HeLa cells, TNF-a treatment enhanced AKT activation,
whereas CF31 and K-80003 showed comparable effect on
inhibiting AKT activation. Both compounds were much

more effective than sulindac when used at 10 mmol/L (Fig.
5A). We then examined whether CF31 could inhibit TNF-a
activation of AKT. Treatment of HeLa cells with TNF-a
for 30 minutes strongly activated AKT, which was inhibited
by either CF31 or K-80003 in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5B). Both compounds at 20 mmol/L completely inhibited the effect of TNF-a on activating AKT. CF31 could also
inhibit basal and TNF-a–induced AKT activation in other
cancer cell lines, including A549 lung cancer and HepG2 liver
cancer cells (Fig. 5C). All these cancer cell lines expressed
high levels of tRXR-a, as revealed by immunoblotting using
DN197 anti-RXR-a antibody recognizing the LBD of RXR-a
(29; Fig. 5C).
To study the role of tRXR-a in CF31 action, we ﬁrst assessed
the effect of RXR-a siRNA transfection. Transfection of RXR-a
siRNAs in A549 cells, which reduced levels of both the fulllength RXR-a and tRXR-a (29), abolished the inhibitory effect
of CF31 on AKT activation either in the absence or presence of
TNF-a (Fig. 5D). To complement this study, we determined
whether overexpression of tRXR-a could enhance the inhibitory effect of CF31. For this purpose, we stably expressed GFPRXR-a/D80 (29), a GFP-tagged RXR-a mutant lacking 80 Nterminal amino acid residues, in SW480 colon cancer cells that
expressed little tRXR-a protein (Fig. 5E), SW480 cells exhibited
low basal AKT activation, and their AKT activation was insen-

sitive to regulation by TNFa and (Fig. 5E). However, stable
expression of GFP-RXRa/D80 enhanced not only their basal
AKT activation but also their response to TNF-a induction of
AKT activation (Fig. 5E). Moreover, the sensitivity of SW480
cells to CF31 was restored, as it could effectively inhibit TNFa–induced AKT activation in SW480/RXR-a/D80 cells. Thus,
tRXR-a expression is involved in AKT activation by TNF-a and
is essential for its inhibition by CF31.
Previously, we reported that tRXR-a binding to p85a was
essential for the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (29).
Thus, we determined whether CF31 inhibition of tRXRa–dependent AKT activation could be attributed to its interference with tRXR-a interaction with p85a. Consistent with
our previous observation, TNF-a induced interaction of tRXRa with p85a, as revealed by coimmunoprecipitation using the
DN197 anti-RXR-a antibody (Fig. 5F). However, when cells
were cotreated with CF31, TNF-a–induced tRXR-a–p85a
interaction was largely abolished. Thus, CF31 may modulate
AKT activation through its ability to inhibit the interaction of
tRXR-a with p85a.

result in apoptosis, we ﬁrst examined the effect of CF31 on

cells in the presence of TNF-a by immunostaining using a Bax
conformation-sensitive antibody Bax/6A7 that recognizes
active Bax protein (46). As shown in Fig. 6A, immunostaining
with Bax/6A7 antibody showed that activated Bax protein was
undetectable in control cells. However, when cells were treated
with CF31, a strong immunostaining was observed, suggesting
the activation of Bax by CF31. The apoptotic effect of CF31 in
the presence of TNF-a was also illustrated by its induction of
PARP cleavage in HepG2 and HeLa cells (Fig. 6B). Induction of
PARP cleavage by TNF-a/CF31 combination treatment was
associated with reduction of AKT activation, suggesting that
the inhibition of AKT activity plays a role in their induction of
apoptosis. In support of the role of AKT inhibition by the
combination treatment, transfection of the constitutive-active
AKT (CA-AKT) expression vector prevented its induction of
PARP cleavage (Fig. 6C).
We also determined the role of RXR-a in CF31-induced
apoptosis by transfecting control and RXR-a siRNA in HeLa
cells. Comparison of the effect of CF31 in cells transfected with
control siRNA or RXR-a siRNA showed that transfection of
RXR-a siRNA impaired the ability of CF31 to induce PARP
cleavage and to inhibit AKT activation (Fig. 6D). To address the
role of tRXR-a, we examined the effect of CF31 on PARP
cleavage in cells stably expressing RXR-a/D80. In A549 cells,
CF31 showed little effect on inducing PARP cleavage (Fig. 6E).
However, it signiﬁcantly induced PARP cleavage in cells stably
expressing RXR-a/D80 tagged with Myc epitope, Myc-RXRa/D80. Similar results were obtained in MCF-7 breast cancer
cells stably expressing GFP-RXRa/D80 (Fig. 6F). Thus, the
expression of tRXR-a plays a role in the apoptosis induction
by CF31.

CF31 activates TNF-a–induced extrinsic apoptotic
pathway
TNF-a is capable of inducing opposing biologic activities,
such as cell survival and death, and its killing effect in cancer
cells are often antagonized by its survival function that is
mainly mediated by activation of the NF-kB and PI3K/AKT
pathways (47, 48). Our observation that both inhibition of AKT
activation and induction of apoptosis by CF31 occurred in the
presence of TNF-a prompted us to study whether CF31 could
convert TNF-a from a survival to a killing molecule. Thus,
caspase-3 activation was examined in HeLa cells treated with
CF31 or TNF-a alone or their combination. Treatment of cells
with either CF31 or TNF-a alone had little effect on caspase-3
activation, whereas the combination treatment resulted in
strong caspase-3 activation (Fig. 7A). The combination treatment also strongly induced the activation of caspase-8, the
downstream mediator of the TNF-a–dependent apoptotic
pathway (47, 48). Caspase-8 activation by CF31/TNF-a combination was also revealed by immunoblotting showing strong
induction of cleaved caspase-8 products, p43/p41, an indication of caspase-8 activation (Fig. 7B). The induction of caspase8 activation and PARP cleavage by the CF31/TNF-a combination was partially impaired by transfection of RXR-a siRNA
(Fig. 7B), showing a role of RXR-a.
Induction of PARP cleavage by CF31/TNF-a combination
treatment was closely correlated with caspase-8 activation
(Fig. 7B), suggesting an activation of TNF-a–dependent apoptotic pathway by CF31. To further address the role of caspase8 activation in apoptosis induction by CF31, we examined the
effect of caspase-8 siRNA transfection. Transfection of HeLa
cells with caspase-8 siRNA reduced the level of p43/p41 and

Xanthones, a class of 3-membered heterocyclic ring compounds mainly found as secondary metabolites in higher
plants and microorganisms, exert very diverse biologic proﬁles,
including antihypertensive, antioxidative, antithrombotic, and
anticancer activity, depending on their diverse structures (30–
33). A large number of naturally occurring and synthetic
xanthones such as psorospermin (50), dimethylxanthesone4-acetic acid (DMXAA; ref. 51), and a-mangostin (52) have
shown potent anticancer activities. However, the biologic
targets of xanthone compounds remain elusive (30–33). Cratoxylum is a small genus distributed in Southeast Asia with
some of its species used medicinally, and xanthones are the
most characteristic biologically active components of this
genus (31, 35, 52, 53). We have previously identiﬁed several

bioactive xanthones from the stems of Cratoxylum formosum
ssp. pruniﬂorum (34, 35). We report here that CF31, one of the
xanthones that we isolated, acts as a potent negative regulator
of the tRXR-a–mediated PI3K/AKT survival signaling pathway
by binding to RXR-a, thus identifying CF31 as a new lead for a
class of anticancer agents targeting this newly identiﬁed
cancer survival pathway.
CF31 binds to RXR-a in a unique mode and acts as a RXR-a
antagonist. The LBP of RXR is highly restrictive to ﬂexible and
elongated ligands. The published crystal structures of RXR-a
bound to natural or synthetic ligands show that a carboxylate
group in these ligands forms salt bridges with basic residue
Arg316 at the end of the L-shaped RXR-a LBP to establish
anchoring ionic interaction for stabilization (41–43). However,
CF31 lacks such a carboxylate moiety (Fig. 1A) and is therefore
incapable of interacting with Arg316. This was supported by

our mutagenesis study, which showed that Arg316 was not
required for its antagonist effect (Fig. 2C). Although Arg316 was
not required for CF31 binding, our MM-PB/SA analysis suggested that the binding of CF31 was stabilized by its extensive
van der Waals interactions with several hydrophobic residues
in the RXR-a (Fig. 2E), thus revealing a distinct binding mode
for CF31. It is noteworthy that mutation of Arg316, which
completely impaired the transactivation function of 9-cis-RA,
did not show much effect on CD3254 (Fig. 2C), implying that
CD3254 binding to RXR-a does not require its ionic interaction
with Arg316. Very recently, crystal structure studies showed
that begelovin, a RXR-a agonist lacking the carboxylate moiety,
bound to RXR-a (54) in a mode similar to CF31. Thus, the LBP
of RXR-a is more ﬂexible than expected to mediate diverse
activities of compounds with different structural features.
CF31 effectively inhibited constitutive and inducible AKT
activation and cell survival in several cancer cell lines (Figs. 4
and 5). It was much more effective than sulindac, an nonste-

316

roidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID) that was previously
reported to inhibit tRXR-a–mediated AKT activation (29), and
was comparable with K-80003, an improved sulindac analog
(29), on inhibiting AKT activation (Fig. 5A and data not shown).
The inhibitory effect of CF31 on AKT activation occurred at
concentrations under that CF31 could bind to RXR-a, suggesting that it achieved its inhibitory effect on AKT activation by
RXRa binding. In support of this conclusion, we showed that
knocking down RXR-a expression by RXR-a siRNA impaired
its inhibitory effects on basal and TNF-a–induced AKT activation (Fig. 5D), whereas overexpression of tRXR-a resulted in
an enhancement (Fig. 5E).
Another unique property of CF31 is its ability to convert
TNF-a from a survival molecule to a killer of cancer cells. TNFa is a multifunctional cytokine that plays roles in diverse
cellular events, such as cell survival and death (47, 48, 55,
56). The apoptotic effect of TNF-a is mediated by caspase-8–
dependent apoptotic pathway, whereas its survival function

CF31 Inhibits AKT Activation by tRXR-a

involves activation of PI3K/AKT and NF-kB pathways. Because
the death effect of TNF-a is antagonized or suppressed by its
abnormally elevated survival function in cancer cells, TNF-a
often acts as a survival instead of killer in the cells (47, 48, 55,
56). Because TNF-a is produced by malignant or host cells in
the tumor microenvironment but not in normal cells, there has
been tremendous interest in developing strategies to change a
tumor-promoting microenvironment to a tumor-inhibiting
state by shifting TNF-a signaling from survival to death (47,
48, 57–59). Our previous discovery that tRXR-a mediates AKT
activation by TNF-a provides an opportunity to convert TNFa's function from survival to death in cancer cells by targeting
tRXR-a (29). Our current study provides several lines of
evidence that CF31 could act as such a converter through its
ability to suppress tRXRa–mediated AKT activation by TNFa. First, we found that CF31 could potently induce PARP
cleavage in cancer cells when used together with TNF-a (Fig.
6). Moreover, combination of CF31 and TNF-a led to a synergistic effect on PARP cleavage (Fig. 6C) and caspase activation (Fig. 7A), showing that the apoptotic effect of CF31
requires the TNF-a signaling pathway. Second, induction of
PARP cleavage by the combination treatment in cancer cells
was associated with their inhibition of AKT activation (Fig. 6B),
which was also tRXR-a dependent (Fig. 6D–F). In contrast,
transfection of CA-AKT abolished the inducing effect of CF31/
TNF-a combination on PARP cleavage (Fig. 6C). Thus, inhibition of AKT activation was essential for their induction of
apoptosis. Third, induction of caspase-3 activation and PARP
cleavage by the CF31/TNF-a combination was mediated by
activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 7), a critical mediator of TNFa–induced intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Thus, CF31 can serve
to relieve the antiapoptotic function of AKT, leading to activation of TNF-a–dependent apoptosis. Together, our results
identify CF31 as a new converter of TNF-a survival signaling in
cancer cells. With its ability to shift TNF-a signaling from
survival to death by its unique RXR-a binding, CF31 represents

a promising lead for a class of RXR-a modulators that selectively induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Because of the proven
natural product drug discovery track record, identiﬁcation of
a natural product that targets an RXR-mediated cell survival
pathway that regulates PI3K/AKT may offer a new therapeutic
strategy to kill cancer cells.
