Abstract
Nuclear factor erythroid-2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redoxsensitive transcription factor that regulates the expression of
electrophile and xenobiotic detoxification enzymes and efflux
proteins, which confer cytoprotection against oxidative stress
and apoptosis in normal cells. Loss of function mutations in the
Nrf2 inhibitor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1),
results in constitutive activation of Nrf2 function in non–small
cell lung cancer. In this study, we show that constitutive
activation of Nrf2 in lung cancer cells promotes tumorigenicity
and contributes to chemoresistance by up-regulation of
glutathione, thioredoxin, and the drug efflux pathways involved
in detoxification of electrophiles and broad spectrum of drugs.
RNAi-mediated reduction of Nrf2 expression in lung cancer cells
induces generation of reactive oxygen species, suppresses tumor
growth, and results in increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic
drug–induced cell death in vitro and in vivo. Inhibiting Nrf2
expression using naked siRNA duplexes in combination with
carboplatin significantly inhibits tumor growth in a subcutaneous model of lung cancer. Thus, targeting Nrf2 activity in
lung cancers, particularly those with Keap1 mutations, could
be a promising strategy to inhibit tumor growth and
circumvent chemoresistance. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7975–84]

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United
States and worldwide for men and women. Despite considerable
progress over the last 25 years in the systemic therapy of lung
cancer, intrinsic and acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents remains a challenge (1). Most patients with small cell lung
cancer have a favorable initial response to chemotherapy, but the
majority relapse and their tumors tend to be largely refractory to
further treatment. Non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are
intrinsically resistant and are generally nonresponsive to initial
chemotherapy. Frequently, resistance is intrinsic to the cancer, but
as the therapy becomes increasingly effective, acquired resistance
has also become common (1).

Formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is important for
induction of apoptosis for commonly used chemotherapy agents
such as cisplatin, bleomycin, paclitaxel, adriamycin, and etoposide
(2, 3). Many chemotherapeutic agents depend on oxidative insult to
cancer cells for their mode of action. Xenobiotic metabolism
enzymes in conjunction with drug efflux proteins act to detoxify
cancer drugs, whereas antioxidants confer cytoprotection by
attenuating drug-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. Several
studies have shown that the expression of xenobiotic metabolism
genes [glutathione-S-transferases (GST)], antioxidants [glutathione
(GSH)], and drug efflux proteins [multidrug resistance protein
(MRP) family] are increased in NSCLC (4–6). Cancer cells exhibit a
superior defense system against electrophiles compared with
normal cells due to the up-regulation of genes involved in
electrophile detoxification. In addition, lung cancer cells have
greater expression of MRPs, which confer chemoresistance (7).
In normal cells, nuclear factor erythroid-2–related factor 2 (Nrf2),
a cap ‘n’ collar basic leucine zipper transcription factor regulates a
transcriptional program that maintains cellular redox homeostasis
and protects against toxic xenobiotics. Kelch-like ECH-associated
protein (Keap1) is a cytoplasmic anchor of Nrf2 and maintains
steady-state levels of Nrf2 and Nrf2-dependent transcription by
targeting it for proteasomal degradation (8–10). Keap1 constitutively suppresses Nrf2 activity in the absence of stress. Oxidants,
xenobiotics, and electrophiles hamper the Keap1-mediated proteasomal degradation of Nrf2, which results in increased nuclear
accumulation and transcriptional induction of target genes. The
Nrf2-regulated transcriptional program includes a broad spectrum
of genes, including genes encoding antioxidants [e.g., the glutathione system: g-glutamyl cysteine synthetase modifier subunit
(GCLm), g-glutamyl cysteine synthetase catalytic subunit (GCLc),
glutathione synthetase, glutathione reductase (GSR), glutathione
peroxidase (GPX), and the cysteine/glutamate transporter
(SLC7A11); the thioredoxin system: thioredoxin-1 (TXN), thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD1) and peroxiredoxins (PRDX), xenobiotic
metabolism enzymes [e.g., NADP(H) quinone oxidoreductase 1
(NQO1), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase], and members of the GST
family], and several ATP-dependent multidrug-resistant drug efflux
pumps (e.g., ABCC1 and ABCC2; refs. 11–18). Nrf2 also protects
against apoptosis induced by oxidants and FAS ligand (16, 19, 20).
Down-regulation of Nrf2 using antisense RNA resulted in cell
sensitization to apoptosis (19). Thus, Nrf2 promotes survival against
stress caused by exposure to electrophiles and xenobiotics.
Recently, we have reported point mutations in the Keap1 gene
leading to nonconservative amino acid substitutions and nonsense

mutations in a high percentage of the lung cancer cell lines and
tumors (21). Somatic mutations in Keap1 coding region in Japanese
patients with lung cancer as well as breast cancer have been
reported by other groups (22–24). Loss of Keap1 activity due to
mutations leads to constitutive activation of Nrf2. In the present
study, we determined the functional consequences of increased
Nrf2 activity in lung cancer using two lung cancer cell lines (A549
and H460) with complete loss of functional Keap1 activity (21) and
developed a novel strategy for counteracting therapeutic resistance
by targeting Nrf2-Keap1 pathway.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. A549 and H460 cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection and cultured under recommended
conditions. All transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen).
Generation of lung cancer cell lines stably expressing Nrf2 short
hairpin RNA. To inhibit the expression of Nrf2, we designed a short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) targeting the 3¶ end of the Nrf2 transcript as described in our
previous reports (21, 25). The Nrf2-shRNA duplex with the following sense
and antisense sequences was used as follows: 5¶GATCCGTAAGAAGCCAGATGTTAATTCAAGAGACATTCTTCGGTCTACAATTTTTTTTGGAAA-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAAATTGTAGACCGAAGAATG
TCTCTTGAATTAACATCTGGCTTCTTACG-3¶ (antisense; ref. 21). Short
hairpin RNA cassette was subcloned into pSilencer vector and transfected
into A549 and H460 cells. A shRNA-targeting luciferase gene was used as
control. Stable cell clones with reduced Nrf2 expression were generated.
For the in vivo experiments, all siRNA compounds were chemically
synthesized being stabilized by 2’-OMe modifications (Biospring). The
sequence of siRNA targeting human Nrf2 used for in vivo experiments is
5¶-UCCCGUUUGUAGAUGACAA-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-UUGUCAUCUACAAACGGGA-3¶ (antisense). The sequence of control siRNA targeting green
fluorescent protein (GFP) is 5¶-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3¶ (sense)
and 5¶-GGUGCGCUCCUGGACGUAGC-3¶ (antisense; ref. 26).
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from
tumors and cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The reverse transcription
reaction was performed using high-capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Applied
Biosystems). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
analyses of Human Nrf2, GCLc, GCLm, GSR, SLC7A11, G6PDH, PRDX1,
GSTM4, MGST1, NQO1, HO-1, TXN1, TXNRD1, ABCC1, and ABCC2 were
performed by using assay on demand primers and probe sets from Applied
Biosystems. h-ACTIN was used for normalization.
Western blot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was performed by
following the protocol described by Singh and colleagues (21). The
following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-Nrf2, antiTXNRD1, and anti-actin (SantaCruz Biotechnology), anti–glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Imgenex), anti–Caspase-3 (BD
Biosciences), and anti-TXN1 (American Diagnostica).
Measurement of ROS levels. Cells were incubated with 10 Amol/L
c-H2DCFDA (Molecular probes) for 30 mins at 37jC to assess the ROSmediated oxidation to the fluorescent compound c-H2DCF. Fluorescence of
oxidized c-H2DCF was measured at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm
and an emission wavelength of 525 nm using a FAC Scan flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences).
Enzyme assay. Enzyme activities of GST, GSR and NQO1, and G6PDH
were determined in the total protein lysates by following methods
previously described (27).
Drug accumulation assay. A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA cells
as well as their respective control cells expressing Luc-shRNA were seeded
at a density of 0.3  106 cells/mL in 6-well plates. After 12 h, growth
medium was aspirated and replaced with 1.5 mL of RPMI 1640 containing
0.2 Amol/L of [3H] Etoposide (646 mCi/mmol; Moravek Biochemicals) and
[14C] Carboplatin (53 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were
incubated with radiolabeled drug for indicated period of time and then
cooled on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and solubilized with 1.0 mL of 1%

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

SDS. The radioactivity in each sample was determined by scintillation
counting. Results are presented as means F SD. Comparisons were made by
paired t test.
MTS cell viability assay. The in vitro drug sensitivity to etoposide and
carboplatin was assessed using Cell Titer 96-Aqueous assay kit (Promega).
Cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates,
allowed to recover for 12 h, and then exposed to various concentrations of
etoposide and carboplatin for 72 to 96 h. Drug cytotoxicity was evaluated by
adding 40 AL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-Carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium solution. The plates were incubated at 37jC
for 2 h and absorbance at 490 nm was measured. Each combination of
cell line and drug concentration was set up in eight replicate wells, and the
experiment was repeated thrice. Each data point represents a mean F SD
and normalized to the value of the corresponding control cells.
Cell proliferation assay. Cellular proliferation was analyzed using the
colorimetric MTS assay kit (Promega). Briefly, H460 cells (1,000 cells per
well) and A549 cells (1,500 cells per well) were plated in 96-well plates, and
the growth rate was measured.
Soft agar growth assay. A549 and H460 cells (2  104) stably expressing
Nrf2-shRNA or the control Luc-shRNA were diluted in 4 mL of DMEM
containing 10% serum and 0.4% low-melting-point (LMP) agarose. This
mixture was subsequently placed over 5 mL of hardened DMEM containing
10% serum and 1% LMP and allowed to harden at room temperature. The
cells were allowed to grow for 2 to 3 wk, after which visible colonies
containing >50 cells were counted.
Tumor xenografts and siRNA treatment. We injected A549 cells
(5  106) and H460 cells (2  106) s.c. into the flank of athymic nude mice
and measured the tumor dimensions by caliper once every week. The tumor
volumes were calculated using the following formula: [length (mm)  width
(mm)  width (mm)  0.52]. For in vivo delivery of siRNA into tumors,
siRNA duplexes diluted in PBS were injected into the tumors using insulin
syringes at a concentration of 10 Ag of siRNA/50 mm3 of tumor volume.
Intraperitoneal injections of carboplatin were given at a dose of 40 mg/kg
body weight. Both siRNA and carboplatin were administered weekly twice
for 4 wk. Upon termination, tumors were harvested and weighted. All
experimental protocols conducted on the mice were performed in
accordance with NIH guidelines and were approved by the Johns Hopkins
University Animal Care and Use Committee.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections were treated with anti–Ki-67 antibody at a dilution of 1:100 for
1 h and stained using LSAB+System-HRP kit (DakoCytomation) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nonimmune rabbit IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as a negative control. Ki-67–
positive cells/200 cancer cells were counted in randomly selected visual
fields at 20 magnification, and the mean of 5 fields were calculated.
Statistical analysis. Statistical comparisons were performed by
Student’s t tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum test or m2 test. A P value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant. Tumor weights and changes in
tumor volume were summarized using descriptive statistics. Differences in
tumor measures between treatment groups were examined using linear
regression models with generalized estimating equations. The distributions
of both tumor measurements were skewed, so log transformations were
used.

Results
Generation of lung cancer cell lines stably expressing
Nrf2shRNA. To inhibit the expression of Nrf2, we designed a
shRNA targeting the 3¶ end of the Nrf2 transcript as described in
our previous reports (21, 25). Short hairpin RNA cassette was
subcloned into pSilencer vector and transfected into A549 and
H460 cells. A shRNA-targeting luciferase gene was used as control.
Stable cell clones with reduced Nrf2 expression were generated. We
screened 15 clones transfected with Nrf2-shRNA and 10 clones
transfected with luciferase shRNA for each cell line by real-time
quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. After initial screening, we

selected two independent clones of A549 cells expressing Nrf2shRNA, which showed a stable 85% down-regulation of Nrf2 mRNA
(Fig. 1a). A single clone expressing Nrf2 shRNA derived from H460
cells showed 70% inhibition of Nrf2 mRNA (Fig. 1b). Measurement
of Nrf2 protein by Western blotting showed similar decrease in
protein levels. The expression of Nrf2 did not change between the
control cells transfected with luciferase shRNA and the untransfected cancer cells (Fig. 1c).
Lowering Nrf2 expression in A549 and H460 cells causes
global decrease in expression of electrophile and drug
detoxification system. Lowering of Nrf2 protein level leads to a
decline in the expression of electrophile and drug detoxification
genes in normal cells. The expression of selected electrophile and
drug detoxification genes were determined in two clones of A549
and one clone of H460 cells stably expressing Nrf2 shRNA using
real-time RT-PCR (Table 1).
Lowering Nrf2 expression by RNAi in the A549 and H460 cells
decreased the mRNA expression of the genes that constitute the
glutathione system [g-glutamyl cysteine synthetase modifier and
catalytic subunit (GCLM, GCLC), GSR, and the SLC7A11 that
transports cysteine for synthesis of glutathione] as well as the
glutathione-dependent enzymes GPx2, GPx3, and Glutathione
S-transferases (MGST1 and GSTM4; Table 1).
Enzyme activity measurements for selected gene products
(GSR, GPX, and GST) were carried out to determine the extent
to which their transcriptional inhibition paralleled changes in
their activities. There was significant decrease in activities of all
of these enzymes in the A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA
cells relative to the cells expressing luciferase shRNA (Fig. 1B).
Direct measurement of intracellular GSH concentration by Teitz
assay showed a decrease in GSH levels in Nrf2-depleted A549
cells and in H460 cells (Fig. 1C). Pretreatment of A549LucshRNA and A549-Nrf2shRNA cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine
(NAC) increased GSH levels in both A549-LucshRNA and A549Nrf2shRNA cells, but the total GSH levels in NAC-treated
A549-Nrf2shRNA remained much less than the vehicle-treated
A549-LucshRNA cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). A549-LucshRNA
cells responded rapidly, and their GSH levels increased after
1 hour of NAC treatment. A549-Nrf2RNA cells showed an
increase in GSH levels only after 24 hours of NAC treatment,
suggesting that GSH synthesis in response to NAC treatment is
impaired in A549-Nrf2RNA cells.
Lowering of Nrf2 in A549 and H460 cell caused significant
decrease in the mRNA for TXN1 and TXNRD1, which constitutes
the thioredoxin system and has been associated with therapeutic
resistance. Protein levels of TXN1 and TXNRD1 were decreased in
A549-Nrf2shRNA cells but did not change between control A549
cells expressing Luc-shRNA and the untransfected cells (Fig. 1D).
NADPH is required to provide reducing equivalents for the
regeneration of reduced glutathione and thioredoxin by GSR and
TXNRD1. Expression of genes encoding the NADPH biosynthesis
enzymes, such as G6PDH and malic enzyme 1 (ME1) were downregulated in the A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA cells,
suggesting the dependence of these genes on Nrf2 for their
expression (Table 1). Consistent with low transcript levels, G6PDH
enzyme activity was significantly down-regulated in A549Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA (Fig. 1C).
We also found that other antioxidant genes such as NQO1, HO-1,
and PRDX1 were down-regulated as a result of lowering of Nrf2 by
shRNA in cancer cells (Table 1). Furthermore, the transcript levels
of MRP such as ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C, member 1

www.aacrjournals.org

(ABCC1) and ATP-binding cassette, sub family C, member 2
(ABCC2), were significantly down-regulated in cells expressing Nrf2
shRNA. Thus, down-regulation of Nrf2 profoundly decreased the
expression of antioxidant enzymes and electrophile and drug
detoxification systems in cancer cells with constitutive activation
of Nrf2 function.
Enhanced production of ROS in cells stably transfected with
Nrf2 shRNA. To determine the degree of overall increase in
oxidative stress as a result of global decrease in the expression of
electrophile detoxification system by down-regulating Nrf2, intracellular ROS levels were monitored using 2¶, 7¶-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (c-H2DCFDA) and flow cytometry. The results
showed an increase in fluorescence in both A549-Nrf2shRNA and
H460-Nrf2shRNA cells (Fig. 2A–B). A549-Nrf2 shRNA cells showed
a pronounced 25-fold increase in ROS level, whereas H460Nrf2shRNA cells showed a 3.5-fold increase in ROS levels.
Treatment of these cells with nonspecific free radical scavenger
NAC for 30 minutes reduced ROS production and attenuated the
mean fluorescent intensity in A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460Nrf2shRNA by 85% and 75% in A549 and H460 cells, respectively.
These results suggest that the generation of ROS at a steady state is
relatively increased in Nrf2 shRNA transfectants than in control
Luc-shRNA cells. Interestingly, inhibition of Nrf2 activity in
nontumorigenic BEAS2B cells did not show a significant increase
in ROS (Fig. 2C). Thus, constitutive Nrf2 activity is indispensable
for maintaining redox balance in cancer cells unlike normal cells in
the absence of stress.
Decrease in Nrf2 expression by shRNA leads to increased
drug accumulation and enhanced chemosensitivity in cancer
cells. Because Nrf2 shRNA causes decrease in expression of drug
detoxification enzymes as well as drug efflux pumps, we measured
drug accumulation in cancer cells (H460 and A549) stably
transfected with shRNA-targeting Nrf2. A nonspecific shRNAtargeting luciferase (Luc shRNA) was used as control. To analyze
drug accumulation, cells were incubated with radiolabeled drug
and intracellular drug content was assayed at various time points.
Drug retention was substantially higher in Nrf2shRNA cells (f1.5to 2-fold) at 30 to 120 minutes compared with the control LucshRNA cells. The difference in intracellular drug content remained
the same or increased with time. Increased drug accumulation in
cells with low levels of Nrf2 protein suggests that Nrf2 plays an
important role in regulating the accumulation of drug in the cancer
cells (Fig. 3A–B).
To study whether targeting Nrf2 expression enhances the
sensitivity of lung cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs such
as carboplatin and etoposide, we used same A549 and H460 cells
stably expressing Nrf2 shRNA. We treated these cell populations
with escalating concentrations of carboplatin and etoposide. The
concentrations were selected after pilot experiments to determine
the maximum amount of drug that revealed survival differences
between A549 and H460 cells expressing control shRNA and its
derivatives expressing anti-Nrf2 shRNA. We found that lowering of
Nrf2 expression in both A549 and H460 cell lines greatly enhanced
the cytotoxicity (f30–70%) of these drugs resulting in increased
cell death compared with the control shRNA group (Fig. 3C–D).
The IC50 doses of carboplatin and etoposide was followed by a
reduction in the number of viable cells to 50% compared with
vehicle-treated control cells. The IC50 for carboplatin and etoposide
decreased in both A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA cells
when compared with their respective control cells expressing
luciferase shRNA.

NOTE: Genes down-regulated in A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2 shRNA cells in response to Nrf2 inhibition. The expressions of several Nrf2dependent genes were quantified using real-time RT-PCR. Cells stably expressing luciferase shRNA were used as baseline control to calculate the fold
changes. All the represented fold change values of Nrf2 shRNA–expressing cells are significant compared with the control cells transfected with
luciferase shRNA.

inhibition of Nrf2 can sensitize cells to drug-induced apoptosis, we
carried out Caspase-3 cleavage assays. H460-LucshRNA cells were
resistant to carboplatin-mediated (25 and 50 Amol/L) and etoposide-mediated (1 Amol/L) apoptosis and did not show any caspase-3
cleavage in response to drug treatment. In contrast, H460-Nrf2

shRNA cells displayed the presence of cleaved caspase-3 product,
indicative of apoptosis after treatment with identical concentrations of carboplatin and etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S3).

to examine its significance in the tumorigenic properties of the
NSCLC cells. Depletion of Nrf2 in both the cancer cell lines resulted
in a pronounced decrease in cellular proliferation as measured by
MTS assay (Fig. 4A). We also determined the ability of A549Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA cells to form colonies in soft agar.
Suppression of Nrf2 in H460 and A549 cell lines resulted in a
substantial reduction on colony formation in soft agar compared
with the control cells expressing luciferase shRNA (Fig. 4B). To
further examine the affect of Nrf2 suppression on lung tumorigenesis, we injected A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA and their
corresponding control cells expressing Luc-shRNA into the flank of
athymic nude mice and monitored the increase in tumor volume
over a 4- to 6-week period. Weight of the tumor was recorded at the
termination of the experiment. Significantly, suppression of Nrf2 in
the A549 cells resulted in complete inhibition of tumor formation,
whereas H460 cells showed a less dramatic yet significant and
reproducible reduction in tumor volume (Fig. 4C). Mean difference
in tumor weight between the Luc-shRNA– and Nrf2 shRNA–
expressing H460 cells was 1.24 grams [95% confidence interval
(95% CI), 0.773–1.71; P = 0.0001; Fig. 4D]. Data were analyzed using
two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test. These data

indicate that Nrf2 is required for maintenance of the transformed
phenotype in vitro and in vivo.
Therapeutic efficacy of Nrf2 siRNA in combination with
carboplatin in vivo. To elucidate whether the potential synergistic
mode of action of Nrf2 shRNA and carboplatin observed in cell
culture occurs in vivo, we performed a xenograft experiment with
A549 cells. Mice bearing subcutaneous tumors were randomly
allocated to one of the following groups with therapy beginning
15 days after tumor cell injection: GFP siRNA, GFP siRNA+
carboplatin, Nrf2 siRNA, and Nrf2 siRNA+ carboplatin. Mice were
treated with siRNA and carboplatin twice a week for 4 weeks, and
tumor volume was measured biweekly. Tumor weight was
measured at the termination of the experiment (Fig. 5A;
Supplementary Table S1). Treatment with control nontargeting
siRNA did not inhibit tumor growth compared with control mice
treated with PBS alone (data not shown). The change in tumor
volume was significantly different between GFP siRNA– and
Nrf2 siRNA–treated tumors (P < 0.0001). Tumor weights were
significantly higher in the GFP siRNA–treated tumors compared
with Nrf2 siRNA–treated tumors (ratio of weights, 2.09; 95% CI,
1.41–3.10; P = 0.0002), and siRNA compared with siRNA +

carboplatin–treated tumors (ratio of weights, 2.13; 95% CI,
1.44–3.16; P = 0.001; Fig. 5A). The change in tumor volume was
significantly different between Nrf2 siRNA– and GFP siRNA–
treated tumors (ratio of differences, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.31–0.68;
P = 0.0001) and siRNA + carboplatin and siRNA tumors (ratio of
differences, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29–0.71; P = 0.0005). The difference in
the change in tumor volume was larger between GFP siRNA +
carboplatin and Nrf2 siRNA + carboplatin (differences of 352.34
and 58.78) than it was for GFP siRNA and Nrf2 siRNA (differences
of 532.94 and 249.17), (ratio of differences, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.03–5.48;
P = 0.042). Data from the second set of experiments validating the
same findings is presented in the supplement (Supplementary
Fig. S4; Supplementary Table S2). Gene expression analysis of
randomly selected tumors from GFP siRNA and Nrf2 siRNA groups
showed significant decrease in Nrf2 and its downstream target
gene expression (Fig. 5B).
Immunohistochemical staining of GFP siRNA–treated A549
tumors showed 48% Ki-67–positive cells in tumors treated with
GFP siRNA alone and 46% positive cells in tumors treated with GFP
siRNA and carboplatin, suggesting that carboplatin treatment
alone does not significantly affect the rate of cell replication
(Fig. 5a–b). On the other hand, tumors treated with Nrf2 siRNA
alone showed only 18% of cells labeling with Ki-67, and tumors

treated with a combination of Nrf2 siRNA and carboplatin showed
only 19% of cells labeling with Ki-67, suggesting that blocking Nrf2
expression does reduce the rate of cell replication (Fig. 5c and d).
In addition, the tumors treated with a combination of Nrf2 siRNA
and carboplatin showed areas of massive cell death, corresponding
to the greatly reduced size of tumors seen in this treatment group
(Fig. 5d). Number of Ki-67–positive cells in Nrf2 siRNA–treated
tumors were significantly lower than the GFP siRNA–treated
tumors (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in Ki-67–
labeled cells between the GFP siRNA and GFP+carboplatin or Nrf2
siRNA and Nrf2 siRNA+ carboplatin–treated groups.

Discussion
Therapeutic resistance in cancer cells occurs as a result of
genetic aberrations that confer tumorigenic potential and survival
advantage against chemotherapy. Nrf2, a redox-sensitive bZIP
transcription factor, activates cytoprotective pathways against
oxidative injury, inflammation, and apoptosis through transcriptional induction of a broad spectrum of genes involved in
electrophile/drug detoxification and antioxidant protection
(10, 16, 27). Keap1 negatively regulates Nrf2 activity by targeting
it for proteasomal degradation. We and others have shown that

cellular proliferation was analyzed using

H460; n = 6 for A549). A549 and H460
cells expressing Luc-shRNA were used as
control. Weekly measurements were taken
from the tumors, and the mean tumor
volume was determined after 4 to 6 wk.
Weight of the tumor was recorded at the

difference in tumor weight between the
Luc-shRNA and Nrf2 shRNA expressing
H460 cells was 1.24 grams (95% CI,

there is increased Nrf2 activity in NSCLC cells due to somatic
mutations in the Keap1 gene (21–23). Loss of Keap1 activity leading
to constitutive activation of Nrf2 in lung cancer cells up-regulates
the expression of antioxidants, electrophile, and drug detoxification
enzymes and efflux proteins (21, 22). To understand the functional
significance of the gain of Nrf2 function in lung cancer, we used an

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

RNAi approach and selected two lung cancer cell lines (A549 and
H460) that have been previously reported to have complete loss of
Keap1 activity (21).
Inhibition of Nrf2 in A549 and H460 cells resulted in marked
decrease in the expression of genes that constitute the glutathione
system (GSH biosynthesizing enzymes, GPX, GSR, GST), the
thioredoxin system (TXNRD1, TXN, and PRDX), NADPH regenerating system (G6PDH), antioxidants, and drug efflux pumps (10, 27).
In corroboration with gene expression, enzyme activities of GSR,
GPX, GST, and G6PDH as well as total GSH levels were significantly
reduced in A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA cells when
compared with Luc-shRNA control cells. Thus, down-regulation of
Nrf2 expression profoundly decreased the expression of key
antioxidant enzymes and electrophile/drug detoxification systems
in lung cancer cells with constitutive activation of Nrf2 function.
Increased ROS is common in cancer cells and is believed to be
attributable at least in part to high metabolism and hyperactive
glycolytic metabolism driven by oncogenic proliferative signals (7).
The intrinsic ROS associated with oncogenic transformation
renders the cancer cell highly dependent on antioxidant systems
to maintain redox balance and, thus, vulnerable to agents that
impair antioxidant capacity. The down-regulation of Nrf2 pathway
resulted in dramatic accumulation of intracellular ROS in A549Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA cells. Treatment of these cells
with nonspecific free radical scavenger NAC reduced ROS
production in both A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA cells.
These results suggest that steady-state generation of ROS is
relatively increased in Nrf2-depleted cells compared with control
cancer cells, and it provides a biochemical basis to develop new
therapeutic strategies to preferentially increase ROS to a toxic level
in cancer cells and selectively eradicate them. Interestingly, basal
levels of ROS did not differ between wild-type and nrf2 / mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (28).
Depletion of Nrf2 in both the cancer cell lines resulted in a
pronounced decrease in cellular proliferation. Suppression of Nrf2
in the H460 and A549 cells resulted in a substantial reduction in
colony formation on soft agar compared with the control cells.
Significantly, decreased Nrf2 levels in the A549 cells resulted in
complete inhibition of tumor formation in athymic mice, whereas
H460 cells showed significant reduction in tumor volume and
weight. These data indicate that Nrf2 is essential for growth of
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Recently, Reddy and colleagues (29)
reported that type-II epithelial cells isolated from nrf2 / mice
lungs display defects in cell proliferation, and GSH supplementation rescues these phenotypic defects (29). We hypothesize that
decreased antioxidant capacity leading to increased ROS levels in
A549-Nrf2shRNA and H460-Nrf2shRNA cells inhibited the growth
of these cells in vitro and in vivo compared with the control A549
and H460 cells expressing Luc-shRNA. Thus, unlike normal cells,
constitutive activation of Nrf2 is indispensable for maintaining the
redox balance and growth of lung cancer cells under homeostatic
conditions.
Anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin
are commonly used intravenous platinating agents (30, 31).
Treatment with these agents is characterized by resistance, both
acquired and intrinsic. This resistance can be caused by a number
of cellular adaptations including reduced uptake, inactivation by
glutathione and other antioxidants, and increased levels of DNA
repair. Since Meister (32) claimed that the cellular metabolism of
glutathione could affect the fate of chemotherapeutic agents,
several reports have shown that glutathione content is increased in

Nrf2 Confers Therapeutic Resistance

several drug-resistant cancer cell lines (33, 34). Glutathione, a
nonprotein thiol, can interact with the reactive site of a drug,
resulting in conjugation of the drug with glutathione. The
conjugate is less active and more water soluble and it is excluded
from the cell with the participation of transporter proteins named
GS-X (including MRPs). Increased levels of glutathione were found
in cell lines resistant to alkylating agents (e.g., nitrogen mustard,
chlorambucil, melphalan, cyclophosphamide carmustine, vincristine, and anthracyclines; refs. 5, 35). GSTs catalyze the interactions
between glutathione and alkylating drugs, thereby increasing the
rate of drug detoxification. Thus, activation of these enzymes can
cause cellular drug resistance (5, 36). Expression of thioredoxin,
another important thiol, increases in many human cancers and is a
validated target associated with resistance to standard chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and etoposide and decreased
patient survival (37–39). Inhibition of Nrf2 activity by shRNAmediated gene silencing debilitated the expression of antioxidants
and drug detoxification genes, thereby increasing the accumulation
of etoposide and carboplatin in lung cancer cells and enhanced the
cytotoxicity of these drugs. Increased accumulation of these drugs
in Nrf2 shRNA–expressing cells supports the idea that Nrf2
contributes to drug resistance by modulating the expression of
several drug detoxification enzymes and efflux proteins.
Pretreatment with NAC, a potent thiol antioxidant, reversed the
cytotoxicity of carboplatin in A549 and H460 parent cells as well as
Nrf2-depleted cells and significantly increased the survival.
However, NAC pretreatment did not restore GSH levels to normal
in Nrf2 knockdown cells because the genes involved in GSH
biosynthesis are positively regulated by Nrf2. NAC can protect cells
in this context by covalent binding of the molecule to the platinum,
producing an inactive complex (40–42). Schweitzer (43) showed
that sulfur-containing compounds may prevent cisplatin from
interacting with target molecules, displacing platinum after it is
bound. Therefore, the NAC-mediated protective effect against
carboplatin was most likely due to its function as a direct thiol
containing antioxidant rather than as a precursor for GSH
synthesis (44, 45). Interestingly, pretreatment with NAC had no
effect on etoposide induced apoptotic cell death. Similar observations have been reported by Garder and colleagues (47), where
antioxidants failed to prevent etoposide provoked apoptosis,
although etoposide induced ROS production and glutathione
depletion (46). Etoposide, a topoisomerase-II inhibitor, can be
metabolized to DNA-inactivating catechol, ortho-quinone, and
semiquinone free radical derivatives, which may contribute to its
cytotoxicity (48). GSH protects against semiquinones and orthoquinone free radicals of etoposide by GST-mediated conjugation
with these species (48). The GS-X conjugates of etoposide are
pumped out of the cell by GS-X pumps encoded by ABCC1, ABCC2,
ABCC3, etc (49). Depletion of GSH levels by D,L-buthionine-S,R-

sulfoximine treatment enhanced the cytotoxicity of etoposide (50).
Thus it seems that total cellular GSH content plus phase-II and
phase-III drug detoxification enzymes may be a determinant for
etoposide toxicity.
To elucidate whether suppression of Nrf2 expression can
potentiate the cytotoxicity of carboplatin in vivo, we performed a
xenograft experiment with A549 cells. Mice bearing A549 subcutaneous tumors were treated with Nrf2 siRNA and carboplatin and
tumor volume as well as weight were measured. Treatment with
Nrf2 siRNA alone reduced mean tumor weight by 53% (F20% SD)
compared with the control group. When Nrf2 siRNA was combined
with carboplatin, there was an even greater reduction in mean
tumor weight. Thus, combination of Nrf2 siRNA with carboplatin
led to a significant reduction in tumor growth compared with either
agent alone. Treatment with Nrf2 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation
as shown by reduced Ki-67 staining. Interestingly, tumors treated
with combination of Nrf2siRNA and carboplatin displayed areas of
massive cellular death that was not seen in the other samples. These
findings suggest that Nrf2, but not carboplatin, affects cell
replication, and that the combination of the two agents results in
extensive cell death in addition to the effects on cell replication
caused by Nrf2. Thus, Nrf2 siRNA inhibitors may present a novel
therapeutic approach for lung cancer with chemoresistance.
In conclusion, we show that constitutive activation of Nrf2 plays
an important transcriptional role in the activation of genes
involved in protection against oxidative stress and thereby
promotes tumorigenecity and chemoresistance. These studies
provide a potentially novel therapeutic strategy to circumvent
therapeutic resistance in lung cancer.
