Abstract
Tissue factor (TF), a rate-limiting enzyme cofactor in activating coagulation, is highly expressed in a wide
spectrum of human tumor and tumor stromal cells. Using TF-deficient cancer cells and a conditional TFknockout mouse model, we show that TF expressed by cancer cells, but not by the host stromal cells, plays a
critical role in tumor growth. In the tumor microenvironment, serum coagulation factors are readily extravasated and therefore lead to continuous TF-mediated activation of coagulation proteases. To target this highly
specific cascade of serine proteases, we used both a TF:VIIa inhibitor and doxorubicin-based prodrugs that are
selectively activated by TF:FVIIa, FXa, and thrombin. Treatment with the TF:FVIIa inhibitor led to growth
retardation in breast tumor models. In contrast, treatment with the prodrug eliminated primary tumor cells and
lung metastases without apparent toxicity. Our findings offer preclinical proof of principle that targeting the
coagulation cascade that is activated in the tumor microenvironment can be a highly effective approach for
cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6492–502. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Tissue factor (TF) is the plasmalemma receptor and obligatory cofactor for cell surface assembly and initiation of the
coagulation protease cascade (1). It is widely expressed and a
key determinant of tumor progression (2–6). In addition to its
function as an initiator of hemostasis, TF can signal through
TF:FVIIa, FXa, and thrombin-mediated activation of proteaseactivated receptors. Human TF is a glycoprotein of 263
residues, which shares structural homology with the cytokine
receptor families (7–9). To initiate the coagulation protease
cascade, TF binds and facilitates activation of factor VII(FVII)
to the serine protease factor VIIa(FVIIa) and allosterically
conforms the catalytic site of the bound FVIIa and associates
with the physiologic substrate zymogens factor X(FX) and
factor IX (10, 11), leading to thrombin generation, fibrin
deposition, and platelet activation. TF presence is prominent
in the perivascular cells that form a hemostatic barrier and
serve to limit hemorrhage after vessel injury. Therefore,

TF-mediated coagulation is otherwise inactive elsewhere in
the body, unless there is an injury to the vasculature.
To assess the role of TF in tumor progression, we generated
TF knockout cancer cells by crossing a PyVmT mouse with TF
flox/flox mice. Multiple cancer lines were established from the
tumors developed in TFflox/flox.PyVmT(þ) mice. In addition,
TF knockout was achieved by infecting the established
TFflox/flox.PyVmT(þ) tumor cell line with adenovirus vector
express Cre recombinase. The contribution of the host TF
was evaluated in TFflox/flox LysM Cre(þ) mice with the deleted
TF gene in mature macrophages and granulocytes, and the
TFflox/flox Tie2 Cre(þ) mice specifically deleted TF gene in
endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells. Through these
genetic models, we show that TF expressed by cancer cells
is the key contributor to tumor growth, but not the host TF
expressed by myeloid cells and endothelial cells.
Because of enhanced tumor vasculature permeability, the
coagulation factors and albumin are extravasated and present
in the tumor microenvironment where the coagulation cascade is constantly activated by the high level of the tissue
factor on the tumor and stromal cell surface. Fibrin deposit in
tumor stroma is commonly observed. Therefore, the coagulation cascade is an attractive target for prodrug therapy.
Peptide conjugates of doxorubicin designed for activation by
plasmin (12, 13) and cathepsins (14, 15) have been described.
Indeed, the TF:FVIIa and proteases in the coagulation cascade
have the highest substrate specificity among serine proteases
and are very well characterized (16, 17). We synthesized 2
types of doxorubicin prodrugs targeting coagulation proteases. The first type of prodrug contained a short polyethylene glycol or a succinyl substituent to enhance the prodrug

solubility, while the second prodrug includes an albumin
binding e-maleimidocaproic acid (EMC) moiety to prolong
half-life. The prodrugs were prepared by incorporating a small
peptide appended to the amino functionality of doxorubicin
resulting in an inactive compound, unless hydrolyzed to
leucine-doxorubicin by TF:FVIIa and proteases within the
coagulation cascade. Both types of prodrugs were found to
be effective against primary tumors. However, the EMC containing prodrug showed superior efficacy as a single agent.
In vivo administration of the EMC prodrug achieves complete
tumor growth arrest and size reduction in the aggressive 4T1
murine mammary carcinoma. This strategy is similar to the
cell-impermeable prodrug activation by cell surface–associated legumain in tumors (18, 19). The prodrugs significantly
reduced the number of established lung metastasis and
resulted in tumor eradication in human breast cancer xenogragh. The coagulation protease activated prodrugs were
stable in plasma indicating that the activation of coagulation
is discreet and only occurs in the tumor microenvironment
and during injury. Taken together, these data support that
coagulation cascade is activated in the tumor microenvironment and may serve as an enzymatic target to achieve
chemotherapeutic eradication of cancer and metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell lines
Biotinylated mouse TF antibody was purchased from American Diagnostica. Rabbit FVII antibody and human albumin
were from Abcam. FVIIa and FXa were from HTI. Thrombin
was from R&D systems. Doxorubicin and biotinylated albumin were from Sigma. Tissue factor was kindly provided by
Wolfram Ruf. The 4T1 and MDA-MB231 cell lines were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
and were characterized according to ATCC instructions. The
cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 or Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified
incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 C. All the cell lines were
used within 20 passages.
Immunochemical analysis
4T1 and PyVmT tumor sections were stained by using
biotinylated anti-TF and Goat anti-FVII antibody. Fluorescein
streptavidin and Texas red were used as the secondary
reporting reagent. FVII was i.v. injected into mice to increase
FVII extravasation. Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 laser scanning
confocal microscope was used for analysis.
Albumin extravasation assay
Albumin or biotinylated albumin (30 mmol/kg) was i.v.
injected into the tail vein for observation. Fluorescein avidin
was used for biotinylated albumin staining. Nuclei were
stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Tissue distribution
Drug auto fluorescence was observed 12 hours after
10 mmol/kg i.v. injection. Nuclei were stained with DAPI.
Tissues was homogenized and diluted with 50% ethanol

containing 0.6 mol/L HCL. After normalization of protein
concentration, the relative fluorescent intensity was measured
by using of a Perkin-Elmer LS-50-B spectrofluorometer
(excitation: 470 nm; emission: 590 nm).
Colony-forming cell assays
Bone marrow single cell suspension was (1  106 per mL)
cultured in MethoCult medium containing SCF, IL-3, and IL-6
(Stemcell Technologies) for 10 days at 37 C and 5% CO2 and
the number of colony are counted.
Plasma pharmacokinetics
Blood from mice injected with 15 mmol/kg prodrugs i.v.
were collected at 10 minutes, 6-, 12-, and 24-hour postinjection
and 1:10 diluted. Samples were measured by spectrofluorometer (excitation: 470 nm; emission: 590 nm).
Mouse tumor models
PyVmT murine breast carcinoma was produced by injection of 5  105 TF normal and deficient PyVmT tumor cells
into the right flank of wild or conditional knockout C57BL/6J
mice. 4T1 murine breast carcinoma model was produced by
injection 1  106 4T1 cells into the s.c. site on the back of
BALB/c mice. MDA-MB231 human breast carcinoma model
was generated by injection of 1  106 MDA-MB231 cells into
the s.c. site on the back Hsd:Athymic nude mice. Treatment
was initiated when the tumors reached 4 mm in diameter
through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the indicated
reagents. The lungs were removed on day 24 and fixed in
the Bouin's solution to count spontaneous lung metastases.
Number of lung metastases was counted under an anatomy
microscope. Experimental lung metastases were induced by i.
v. injection of 2  106 4T1 in the tail vein of BALB/c mice.
EMC-LTPRL-DOX treatment was started on day 16 with i.p.
injection of 15 mmol/kg daily. Experimental lung metastases
were count on day 25. Tumor growth (volume ¼ length 
width  width/2) and signs of physical discomfort were
monitored including for any gross evidence of tumor necrosis,
local tumor ulceration, and evidence of toxicity including the
mobility of animals, response to stimulus, piloerection, eating,
and weight. These procedures have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
The Scripps Research Institute.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of data was determined by the
2-tailed Student t test.

Results
TF activates coagulation within the tumor
microenvironment
To determine cancer cell-surface expression of TF:FVIIa
complex, we examined 4T1 murine syngeneic mammary
carcinoma and polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyVmT)
murine spontaneous mammary carcinoma by immunohistochemical analysis using the rabbit anti-mouse TF antibody.
The staining shows that there is high-level expression of the

TF on 4T1 tumor cell surface (Fig. 1A). It also shows that FVII
can be extravasated readily from the vessel into the tumor
microenvironment of primary tumors and TF:FVIIa complex
are detectable on the tumor cell surface (Fig. 1B and 1C). The
TF expression was furthermore found on the cell face of tumor
associated macrophage in PyVmT tumor (Fig. 1D). Expression
of TF is also confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1E). A
schematic presentation of TF:FVIIa complex formation in
primary tumor microenvironment is proposed (Fig. 1F). On
the basis of the size of the coagulation factors and the
enhanced permeability of tumor vasculature (Supplementary
Table S1), FVII and FX extravasate from leaky tumor vessels
into the tumor microenvironment of primary tumors and bind
to the cell surface TF to active coagulation cascade.
Albumin readily extravasates from the tumor
vasculature into tumor microenvironment
To further evaluate the enhanced permeability of tumor
vascular of serum proteins, we examined the extravasation of
albumin by injecting biotinylated albumin into circulation of
tumor-bearing mice. Albumin and biotinylated albumin (30
mmol/kg) were i.v. injected into the tail vein of tumor-bearing
mice. Tumor and normal organ specimens were collected and
frozen sections were probed with Fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled strepavidin to visualize the biotinylated albumin.
Albumin is readily extravasated in tumor, but not in normal
organs such as liver (Fig. 1G). In tumor tissue, biotinylated
albumin is accumulated in the tumor microenvironment

(Fig. 1G, tumor), but absent in normal liver (Fig. 1G, liver)
and other organs (data not shown).
TF overexpression is a critical mediator of the tumor
growth
A transgenic animal expressing the polyoma virus middle T
antigen (PyVmT) is a robust breast cancer model developing
multiple palpable mammary carcinomas spontaneously. To
generate TF knockout cancer cells, we crossed TFþ/þ-PyVmT
(þ) mice with TFflox/flox-PyVmT() mice to acquire
TFflox/flox.PyVmT(þ) mice (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The
mouse tail PCR genotyping were performed to confirm
TFflox/flox.PyVmT(þ) mice (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
TFflox/flox.PyVmT(þ) cancer cell lines were established from
the spontaneous tumors developed in TFflox/flox.PyVmT(þ)
mice. The TF/ PyVmT(þ) cancer cell line was achieved
by infecting the established TFflox/flox.PyVmT(þ) tumor cell
line with adenovirus vector expressing Cre recombinase and
GFPþ marker (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The Cre recombinase
eliminates a segment of TF gene from the genome and
disrupts TF expression completely (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
To examine the role of TF expressed by cancer cell in tumor
growth, TF normal (TFþ/þ-PyVmTþ) and TF-deficient (TF/
PyVmTþ) tumor cells were inoculated into C56BL/6 mice.
The tumor induced by TF-deficient cells grow much slower
than that induced by TF normal cells (Fig. 2A and B). TFdeficient cells only developed and grew small tumors in
mice, indicating a critical role of TF in tumor progression.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of tumor specimens
indicated the TF-deficient tumors contain scarce and small
lobular of tumor cells, but abundance of stromal component
between tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E).
The contribution of TF expressed by stromal cells was
evaluated in mice with conditional TF gene knockout in
different host cells. We have transplanted TF normal cancer
cells into the TFflox/floxLysM Cre(þ) mice in which TF gene
is deleted in mature macrophage and granulocyte, and the
TFflox/flox Tie2 Cre (þ) mice in which TF gene deleted
endothelial cells and hematopoitic cells. We found no difference in tumor growth patterns in these models, and all
the tumor volume are larger than 1,200 mm3 (Fig. 2C and D).
However, when we transplanted TF/ cancer cells into the
TFflox/floxLysM Cre(þ) and Tie2 Cre (þ) mice, tumor growth
is retarded and all the tumor volume is less than 600 mm3
(Fig. 2E and F). TF deletion in stromal cells does not seem to
suppress tumor growth. Taken together these results indicate that TF expressed by cancer cells plays a significant role
in tumor progression, in contrast to TF provided by stromal
cells.

FVIIa inhibitor suppresses tumor growth
To evaluate the role of TF:FVIIa on tumor growth, a
reported high-affinity inhibitor of FVIIa (Supplementary
Fig. S2A) was synthesized and applied in to 4T1 in vivo model
with 0.2 mg/kg dosage daily. At this dose, bleeding time was
prolonged 3-fold (Supplementary Fig. S2B) in mouse tailbleeding experiment. The FVIIa inhibitor had an inhibitory
effect on tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. 2C) that is
consistent with the role of TF:FVIIa activity in tumor growth.
However, the FVIIa inhibitor has a low solubility and short
half-life in blood. The lack of more pronounced effects is due
to the poor pharmacokinetic properties of this compound.
These experiments underscore the difficulty in the development of successful inhibitors for this class of serine proteases
in cancer therapy, especially due to the risk of bleeding.
Synthesis of doxorubicin-based prodrugs
To validate the strategy of tumor microenvironment activated prodrugs and to take advantage of an enhanced vascular
permeability of the blood vessels found in malignant tissue for
circulating macromolecules, we synthesized 2 doxorubicin

prodrugs targeting coagulation proteases containing: (a) a
short polyethylene glycol substituent to enhance the prodrug
solubility, (b) an albumin binding e-maleimidocaproic acid
moiety introduced to react with cysteine-34 of the albumin
circulating in the bloodstream, increasing the prodrug halflife, and significantly reducing drug toxicity. The plasma
protein albumin preferentially accumulates in solid tumors
(20, 21), and can be used as an endogenous drug carrier to
enhance the pharmacologic properties of these drugs. The
synthesis of both prodrugs commenced with the preparation
of peptides 2a–b using standard Fmoc solid phase synthesis,

where 2-(2-methoxyethoxyacetic acid) or e-maleimidocaproic
acid was incorporated as the last amino acid residue in the
growing sequence. After cleavage from the resin, these peptides were purified by RP HPLC. Subsequent coupling with
doxorubicin in the presence of PyBOP and diisopropylethylamine afforded the target prodrugs a and b, which were
purified by RP HPLC and characterized by HR MS (Fig. 3A).
The activation of Peg-LTPRL-DOX by FVIIa and TF:FVIIa
was carried out in vitro and analyzed by LC-MS (Fig. 3B and C).
In the control sample, there was only 1 component, the
Peg-LTPRL-DOX (WM 1240.5; ref. Fig. 3C, peak 2). Hence,

incubation of Peg-LTPRL-DOX with thrombin, FVIIa, and FXa
induced activation of the prodrug producing Leu-DOX (WM
542.5; Fig. 3C, peak 1), which could be separated by liquid
chromatography and detected by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3D).
Inclusion of equal molar soluble TF extracellular domain with
FVIIa significantly enhanced the activity of FVIIa as expected.
However, this still underestimates the catalytic activity of TF:
FVIIa complexes on the cell surface that are of native TF
proteins and in an appropriate cell-surface lipid environment.

Indeed, nonspecific serine protease trypsin has a very low
activity toward this prodrug. Although the catalytic efficiency
of the serine proteases in the coagulation cascade and trypsin
toward prodrug activation were determined (Table 1) and
support the specificity of activation of the prodrug by serine
proteases in the coagulation cascade.
Prodrug activation and accumulation are enhanced in
tumor
The profile of prodrug distribution and activation in vivo
were determined by detecting prodrug and parent drug using
a fluorescent microscope and a fluorometer. Prodrug and
active prodrug accumulation were visualized in tumor sections after i.v. injection of 10 mmol/kg DOX, Peg-LTPRL-DOX,
and EMC-LTPRL-DOX, respectively (Fig. 4A, red color). The
accumulation of the prodrug in tumors of Peg-LTPRL-DOX–
treated mice and EMC-LTPRL-DOX–treated mice was greatly
enhanced compared with that of doxorubicin-treated mice.
Doxorubicin is cell permeable and has a high-clearance rate in
tumor tissue, because doxorubicin is a small molecular compound. The EMC-LTPRL-DOX is cell impermeable until activated and is not taken up by normal tissue cells. The

fluorescence signal in the liver and kidneys of mice treated
with EMC-LTPRL-DOX were primarily extracellular, suggesting that EMC-LTPRL-DOX is not activated in the normal
tissues (Fig. 4A. liver and kidney). Nuclear positivity of active
EMC-LTPRL-DOX is detected in tumor indicating that the
prodrugs are only activated in the tumor microenvironment
(Fig. 4A, tumor). Tumor accumulation and activation of the
EMC-LTPRL-DOX are supported by quantitative assay in
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4B). Binding to albumin (half-life
9–12 days) with EMC group, EMC-LTPRL-DOX shows a longer
half-life in mouse circulating blood than that of doxorubicin,
which almost disappeared after 6 hours from injection
(Fig. 4C).

whereas EMC-LTPRL-DOX given at a "save-dosage" had no
effect on the WBC count. Next, we examined the effect of
EMC-LTPRL-DOX on hematopoietic stem cells using a colony
forming assay. Doxorubicin showed significant suppression on
the formation of CFU-GM. In contrast, EMC-LTPRL-DOX at
the same concentration had no effect on colony formation
(Fig. 5C) indicating the coagulation cascade is not activated in
the bone marrow microenvironment and is consistent with
the lack of TF expression by hematopoietic cells and circulating blood cells. The EMC-LTPRL-DOX was significantly less
toxic than doxorubicin when evaluated in vivo and its accumulated MTD is greater than 20-fold of that of the doxorubicin
(Supplementary Table S3).

Coagulation cascade serine protease-activated prodrug
has low toxicity and is stable in serum
First, we assessed the stability of the prodrug compounds by
mixing the Peg-LTPRL-DOX with mouse serum and incubated
at 37 C for 24 hours. The compounds were subjected to HPLC
analysis at the end of incubation (Fig. 5A) and the prodrugs
appeared very stable in serum and only minor degradation
products were observed that was distinct from activated drug.
With 3 mg/kg injection every 2 days, doxorubicin caused
significant toxicity as shown by weight loss (Fig. 5B) whereas
both Peg-LTPRL-DOX and EMC-LTPRL-DOX lacked apparent
toxicity and weight loss. We further evaluated the effect on
white blood cells by EMC-LTPRL-DOX prodrug and compared
this with doxorubicin (Supplementary Table S2). Single injection of doxorubicin at MTD caused significant WBC reduction,

The coagulation activated prodrugs are affective
against tumor
The 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model was used to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of Peg-LTPRL-DOX, EMCLTPRL-DOX, and doxorubicin. On 21-day posttreatment, tumor volumes of the prodrug-treated groups (3 mmol/kg) were
significantly smaller than the control group (Fig. 6A; P < 0.01
for EMC-LTPRL-DOX, n ¼ 6). The MTD of Peg-LTPRL-DOX (i.
p. 5) was greater than 54 mmol/kg versus that of DOX at 2.8
mmol/kg. Treatment of 4T1 at MTD of DOX showed growth
retardation in this model versus untreated control.

Prodrug with the EMC tag has enhanced efficacy
The efficacy of the albumin-binding prodrug EMC-LTPRLDOX was further enhanced (Fig. 6A), compared with PegLTPRL-DOX at 3 mmol/kg dosage and resulted in near complete growth inhibition at 3 mmol/kg. Thus, prodrug treatment
significantly prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice compared with untreated controls and DOX-treated groups
(Fig. 6B). Both prodrug treatments caused massive tumor
death upon histologic analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). In
groups treated with EMC-LTPRL-DOX at a higher dose, the
tumor growth was completely halted and started to reduce
upon continued treatment (Fig. 6C). Importantly, in a human
MBA-MD-231 xenograph model, EMC-LTPRL-DOX treatment
at 3 mmol/kg led to complete tumor eradication and nonrecurrence with no weight loss and no other apparent signs of
toxicity (Fig. 6D).
Albumin bound prodrug eliminates established breast
cancer metastasis in lung
EMC-LTPRL-DOX treatment at 3 mmol/kg has significant
inhibitory effects on spontaneous metastasis of 4T1 murine
mammary carcinoma (Fig. 7A and B). H&E staining of lung
sections showed metastasis and extensive lung architecture
destruction in untreated control mice, whereas in the treated
mice, metastasis was significantly inhibited and the lung
architecture was nearly normal (Fig. 7C).
Next, we evaluated the effect of high-dosage treatment on
established metastasis. The lung metastasis was induced by
i.v. injection of 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells. On day
16, tumor metastasis was already established in the lung of
tumor-bearing animals (Fig. 7D, control 16 days). The high
dose EMC-LTPRL-DOX treatment was initiated on day 16 with

10 mmol/kg dose for 7 injections. The lungs were dissected on
day 25. Lung metastasis of the treated group on day 25 was
compared with that of the control on day 16 (Fig. 7D). The lung
metastasis in the EMC-LTPRL-DOX–treated group on day 25
was significantly less than that found in control mice on the
day 16 indicating the high dose EMC-LTPRL-DOX treatment is
capable of eliminating established lung metastasis in these
mice (Fig. 7E). H&E staining of lung sections revealed that
treatment of metastasis greatly improves lung tissue morphology (Fig. 7F). Elimination of established metastasis is a
very challenging assay and has great clinical relevance. Taken
together, the effect of EMC-TPRL-DOX represents a promising
treatment for metastatic cancer, a major cause of mortality
of cancer patients.

Discussion
TF is overexpressed in many types of human cancers, and
clinical studies have shown a correlation between the levels of
TF expression and poor prognosis (22–25). Not only does TF
expression occur in a wide spectrum of cancers, but also the
level of expression in cancer cells is upregulated by 1,000-fold
compared with the levels of normal cells that these cancer
cells are derived from (26, 27). This drastic upregulation may,
to some extent, be caused by the existence of common tumor
microenvironmental stimuli, such as those responsible for TF
upregulation during inflammation and hypoxia. Recently, it
was shown that TF expression is under the direct control of
oncogenic pathways activated by genetic mutations sustained
by cancer cells (28). This is shown experimentally by the effect

www.aacrjournals.org

of several mutant oncogenes, including K-ras, EGFR, EGFRvIII,
HER-2, and PML-RARa on TF transcription, translation, halflife, and encryption. The effect of these oncogenes was operative in colorectal, mammary, cutaneous, and astrocytic cancer cells (28–31). In addition, similar changes are also found in
loss of function mutations of major tumor suppressor genes
such as p53 and PTEN (2, 30–32).
Several recent studies indicate that TF plays a role in tumor
biology (33). The formation of the TF:FVIIa and TF:FVIIa:FXa
complexes leads to cleavage of protease-activated receptors
(PAR) at the cell surface (34). The TF:FVIIa–PAR-2 pathway
induces expression of the proangiogenic cytokine IL-8 in
tumor cells (35) and also contributes to retinal neoangiogenesis (36). The TF cytoplasmic domain can regulate the p38
mitogen-activated kinase and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase1/2 and the rac pathways (37) as well as suppress
integrin-mediated migration of cells (36). Increased intravascular TF expression is observed in cancers (33, 38). TF is also
expressed by tumor cells as well stromal cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells (38). This may
contribute to the prothrombotic state (Trousseau's syndrome)
associated with a high percentage of cancer patients (27). In
addition, TF containing procoagulant microparticles may be
shed from different cells, including platelets, leukocytes, and
endothelial cells, or from cancer cells (39–44) and recently these
particles were shown to be important to tumor growth (4).
Breeding conditional TF knockout mice with PyVmT murine spontaneous mammary carcinoma model, we generated
for the first time conditional TF knockout tumor lines that are

cancer lines were established from this tumor model. They
express a high level of TF and the TF gene can be removed by
Cre expressing adenovirus in vitro. The growth patterns of the
TF wild type and the TF-deficient cancer cells provided clear
evidence that TF expressed by tumor cells is required for the
accelerated growth of cancers in this model. In contrast, the
growth of tumor cells in mice lacking TF either in myeloidderived cells and endothelial cells is barely affected, suggesting
the contribution of TF expressed by these 2 types of stromal
cells is small.
Consistent with enhanced permeability of the tumor vasculature, we have shown that coagulation factors are readily
extravasated in tumors. Furthermore, TF initiates the activation
of the coagulation cascade in the tumor microenvironment.
On the basis of on these findings, we designed and validated
PEG-LTPRL-DOX and EMC-LTPRL-DOX prodrugs that can be
selectively catalytically converted to the cytotoxic end product
by the tissue factor–activated coagulation cascade in the tumor
microenvironment. PEG-LTPRL-DOX and EMC-LTPRL-DOX
activation is not found in any significant amount in normal
tissues because TF:FVIIa and thrombin are not activated
without injury. Importantly, PEG-LTPRL-DOX and EMCLTPRL-DOX are very stable in plasma. We found the little
effect of PEG-LTPRL-DOX and EMC-LTPRL-DOX on cells of
myeloid lineage, as mice showed a negligible reduction in
peripheral blood or marrow myeloid cells at elevated therapeutic doses. Although this therapeutic approach showed little
toxicity in our mouse models, the potential toxic risks of off

6500

site activation require careful evaluation in cancer patients
especially when persistent thrombotic conditions such as deep
vein thrombosis exist. Selection criteria to exclude such higherrisk patients may be necessary in initial clinical trial.
Because of the reduced toxicity, larger cumulative dosage of
PEG-LTPRL-DOX and EMC-LTPRL-DOX can be administered
more frequently. Consequently, significant effect of EMCLTPRL-DOX on tumor has been observed in the 4T1 mouse
carcinoma model. In high-dose treatment of EMC-LTPRLDOX in the human MDA-MB231 carcinoma model, the tumor
was completely eradicated, and the host survives long term. In
high-dose treatment, EMC-LTPRL-DOX not only reduced 4T1
tumor metastasis to lung, but also halted and eradicated
established metastasis.
In summary, TF expression in malignant cancers is widely
recognized, yet its functions during tumor progression are
unknown. Our findings implicate TF expressed by cancer cells
can activate a coagulation cascade in the tumor microenvironment and is an essential contributor to tumor progression.
For robust and critical hydrolases, including proteases and
glycosidases that are enriched and activated in the tumor
microenvironment, sufficient inhibition may prove difficult
to achieve pharmacologically without significant toxicity. Target the enzymatic activity for prodrug activation is an attractive alternative and amenable to rationally design drug
candidates. Development of clinically viable inhibitors for
these enzymes has proven to be difficult and has taken up
an overwhelming majority of our collective cancer drug
