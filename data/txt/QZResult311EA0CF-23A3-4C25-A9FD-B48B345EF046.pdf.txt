ABSTRACT
Necroptosis/regulated necrosis is a caspase-independent, but receptor interacting
protein kinase (RIPK)-dependent form of cell death. In previous studies, neoalbaconol
(NA), a constituent extracted from Albatrellus confluens, was demonstrated to induce
necroptosis in some cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanism of NA-induced
necroptosis is described in this research study. We determined that NA-induced cell
death is partly dependent on tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) feed-forward signaling.
More importantly, NA abolished the ubiquitination of RIPK1 by down-regulating E3
ubiquitin ligases, cellular inhibitors of apoptosis protein 1/2 (cIAP1/2) and TNFα
receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). The suppression of RIPK1 ubiquitination induced
the activation of the non-canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and stimulated
the transcription of TNFα. Moreover, we also found that NA caused RIPK3-mediated
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and contribution to cell death. Taken
together, these results suggested that two distinct mechanisms are involved in NAinduced necroptosis and include RIPK1/NF-κB-dependent expression of TNFα and
RIPK3-dependent generation of ROS.

INTRODUCTION

TRAIL and TNFα), virus infection, and anticancer agents,
can initiate necroptosis [2]. Resistance to cell death is a
hallmark of human cancer. Because necroptosis can act
as an alternative cell death pathway when apoptosis is
compromised, it might be exploited as a novel anticancer
strategy [3]. Research results showed that a growing list of
anticancer agents, such as etoposide [4], Smac mimetic [5,
6] and shikonin [7], can initiate necroptosis to kill cancer
cells. These findings raised the possibility that necroptosis
might be considered as an alternative choice for cancer
treatment.

Regulated cell death, a physiologic process for
elimination of damaged cells, is critically important
in normal development and disease pathogenesis.
Multiple mechanisms of regulated cell death have been
identified that function in distinct manners: apoptosis,
autophagic cell death, and necrosis. Necroptosis is a
form of regulated necrosis that is RIPK1/3-dependent
under apoptotic deficient conditions [1]. Several types of
stimuli, including ligands of death receptors (such as Fas,

TNFα, a major mediator of inflammation, cell
survival and cell death depending on cellular context,
is the most extensively studied initiator of necroptosis.
Previous studies showed that zVAD-fmk and IAP
antagonist could induce necroptosis in cancer cells that
was dependent on autocrine TNFα production [8, 9]. By
binding with TNFR1, TNFα triggers the formation of the
TNFR1 signaling complex by recruiting several effectors
such as TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD),
RIPK1, cIAP1/2, and TRAFs [10, 11]. In particular,
ubiquitination, de-ubiquitination and the interaction of
RIPK1 with different adaptor proteins control cell fate
[10, 11]. RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by cIAP1/2 and other
E3 ubiquitin ligases [12]. Interestingly, certain anticancer
agents, such as etoposide, can suppress cIAP1 expression,
thereby inducing formation of a complex called the
ripoptosome, which comprises RIPK1, FADD, RIP3
and caspase 8, resulting in necroptosis [4, 13]. Lys63polyubiquitylated RIPK1 binds to the transforming growth
factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)/TAK1-binding protein
2 (TAB2)/TAB3 complex, leading to the activation of NFκB and transactivation of cytoprotective genes to facilitate
cell survival [10]. Under certain conditions, the RIPK1
Lys63-de-ubiquitination regulated by deubiquitinase
cylindromatosis (CYLD) and A20 switches its function
from survival promotion to cell death [14]. The execution
of necroptosis requires RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase activity
in the necrosome [11]. Activated RIPK3 binding with
mixed lineage kinase-domain like (MLKL) results in ROS
production and necroptotic cell death [15].
Two different NF-κB pathways, referred to as the
canonical and non-canonical pathways, play critical
roles in the regulation of diverse biological processes
[16]. The activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway
is mediated by the phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK
components (IKKα, IKKβ and IKKγ, primarily IKKβ)
and subsequent degradation of IκBα, which results in
the nuclear translocation of the p65-p50 heterodimer,
leading to gene transcription [17]. Unlike IκB degradation,
the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is
dependent on IKKα and its activator, NF-κB inducing
kinase (NIK), but independent of IKKβ and IKKγ [17].
Accumulated NIK phosphorylates and activates inhibitor
of IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates p100 [18]. Upon
phosphorylation by IKKα, p100 is processed in the
proteasome to generate p52; the p52-RelB dimer enters
the nucleus and activates NF-κB-responsive genes to
transcription [19]. Studies showed that loss of cIAPs
facilitates the stabilization of NIK, promoting IKKα/IKKα
activation and NF-κB2 p100 processing to p52 [18, 20].
The non-canonical NF-κB-driven pathway up-regulates
specific target genes, including TNF-α that is required for
Smac mimetic-induced cell death [20, 21]. In particular,
cIAP1/2 is required for stimulus-dependent activation of
the canonical pathway and for constitutive suppression of
the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Under non-stimulated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

conditions, non-canonical NF-κB signaling is suppressed
by cIAP-mediated degradation of NIK [18, 20, 21]. cIAPmediated degradation of NIK also requires TRAF2 and
TRAF3, which function as adaptor proteins recruiting
NIK to cIAPs. Loss of TRAF2, TRAF3 or cIAPs prevents
NIK turnover and results in the accumulation of NIK
protein levels and in the stimulation of non-canonical
NF-κB signaling [22]. For the canonical NF-κB pathway,
stimulation with TNFα leads to recruitment of cIAPs
through TRAF2 to the plasma membrane-bound TNFR1
signaling complex, resulting in the activation of the
canonical NF-κB pathway [23].
Our group previously reported that neoalbaconol
(NA), a novel small-molecular compound isolated
from the fungus, Albatrellus confluens, could activate
autophagy and cause apoptotic and necroptotic cell death
through an independent pathway [24]. Necroptosis was
markedly induced, which was confirmed by the presence
of necrotic morphology, and rescued by the necroptosis
inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) [24]. Here, we report
that NA-induced cell death is dependent on TNFα feedforward signaling. Furthermore, ROS production through
RIPK3 also contributed to cell death in NA-treated cells.
These findings provide novel insights into the molecular
mechanisms of NA-induced necroptosis of cancer cells
and suggest that NA may be a potential therapeutic agent
in the treatment of cancer.

RESULTS
Autocrine production of TNFα correlates with
RIPK-dependent necroptosis in response to NA
In previous study, we found that NA can induce
apoptotic and necroptotic cancer cell death through
an independent pathway. Phosphorylation of Thr357
and Ser358 of MLKL is a specific cellular marker of
necroptosis [15, 25]. To detect necroptosis in NA-treated
cells, an antibody against the phosphorylation of Thr357/
Ser358 of human MLKL was used by Western blot
analysis. The phosphorylation of MLKL was up-regulated
in NA-treated human nasopharyngeal carcinoma C6661 and HK1 cells (Figure 1A). Necrotic cell death has
also been marked by the loss of cytoplasmic membrane
integrity, which can be measured by trypan blue staining.
C666-1 and HK1 cells were treated with NA and then cell
membrane integrity was analyzed at different time points.
The loss of cytoplasmic membrane integrity started 4 h
after treatment and continued with linear kinetics up to
12 h (Figure 1B). RIPKs are well-established as having
a critical function in necroptosis. Knockdown of RIPK1
and RIPK3 reduced cell death induced by NA. These
data suggest that NA induced both RIPK1- and RIPK3dependent necroptotic cell death (Figure 1C).

Autocrine production of TNFα has been recognized
as a critical signal for the induction of necroptosis [8,
9]. In the previous study, several cancer cell lines were
screened with NA and some were killed, whereas others
showed no reduction in viability. Here, a panel of cell
lines was tested to consider the possibility that TNFα
is involved in NA-induced cell death. After 8 h of NA
treatment, cell lines (C666-1, HK1, MX-1, AGS-EBV)
that showed sensitivity to NA showed a 3- to 15-fold
induction of TNFα compared to untreated cells, whereas
‘resistant’ cells (A375, CNE1-LMP1) showed less than a

2-fold induction compared to control cells (Figure 1D).
Exposure to NA also elevated the transcription of TNFα
in L929 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A). Elisa analysis
results demonstrated that after NA treatment cell lines
sensitive to NA (C666-1, HK1) were secreting TNFα into
the cell culture medium, whereas low levels of TNFα
were present in medium of the resistant cell line (CNE1LMP1) (Figure 1E). We further determined whether NAinduced secretion of TNFα contributes to cell death. Cells
were pretreated with a neutralizing TNFα antibody and
then treated with NA. The TNFα neutralizing antibody

partially and dose-dependently rescued cells from death
(Figure 1F). The conditioned medium from C666-1 cells
treated with NA decreased cell viability compared with
the conditioned medium from DMSO-treated cells (Figure
1G). More importantly, the C666-1 conditioned mediummediated death effect could be rescued by Nec-1, but not
zVAD (Figure 1G). zVAD could not up-regulate the TNFα
mRNA level in C666-1 and HK1 cells (Supplementary
Figure 1B), so, there may be a unique mechanism of NAinduced TNFα upregulation. Although, we cannot rule
out the possibility that other factors might have a role
in NA-induced cell death, our research clearly showed
that autocrine TNFα plays a crucial role in NA-induced
necroptotic cell death.

established that NA could down-regulate cIAP1 and
cIAP2, we examined the RIPK1 ubquitination level in
cells treated or not treated with NA. Results showed that
NA exposure led to a reduction in RIPK1 ubiquitination
in C666-1 cells (Figure 3A). In cells treated with
NA, the endogenous levels of cIAP1 and cIAP2 were
decreased by co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-RIPK1
antibody (Figure 3A). Different types of ubiquitination
modifications of RIPK1 can lead to different functions.
To determine which ubiquitination modification of RIPK1
was affected by NA, Wt-Ub, His-UbK48 or His-UbK63
plasmids were introduced into C666-1 cells. NA treatment
reduced the ubiquitination of the K63-linked modification
compared with the control, whereas the ubiquitination of
the K48-linked modification was not affected (Figure 3B).
Either cIAP1 or cIAP2 is required for RIPK1
polyubiquitination and NF-κB activation upon TNFα
treatment [32-34]. Having established that RIPK1
ubiquitination is reduced, we next investigated the
signaling pathways that are regulated by RIPK1,
including the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB
pathways. Western blot analysis showed that treatment
with NA reduced IKKβ and inhibited phosphorylation
of p65 compared to untreated cells, but IKKα was not
changed (Figure 3C). Previous reports showed that IAP
antagonist-induced proteasomal degradation of cIAP1/2
would eliminate the candidate E3 ligases responsible for
proteasomal degradation of NIK, thus allowing NIK to
accumulate and trigger the non-canonical NF-κB pathway
[20]. Here, we found that NIK protein levels increased
and were accompanied by the processing of p100 to p52
following NA treatment (Figure 3C). The Rel-B protein
level was not changed after NA treatment (Figure 3C).
The translocation of p65 to the nucleus is preceded by
the proteolytic degradation of IκBα. NA at a high dose
has a slight effect on IκBα degradation up to 24 h (Figure
3C). Whether NA could suppress constitutive NF-κB/
p65 activation was also examined. Reporter gene data
suggested that constitutive NF-κB/p65 activation was
suppressed by NA at various concentrations (Figure 3D).
Taken together, these findings indicate that NA reduced
the K63 ubiquitination of RIPK1, inhibited the canonical
NF-κB pathway and activated non-canonical NF-κB
pathway, respectively.

NA induces degradation of cIAP1/2 in a
proteasomal-dependent manner
Cells exposed to IAP antagonists can induce
cIAP1/2 degradation, leading to RIPK1 de-ubquitination
and autocrine TNFα to trigger either apoptotic or
necroptotic cell death [12, 26, 27]. To determine whether
cIAP1/2 can be affected by NA, we examined the
cIAP1/2 protein level in cells incubated with or without
NA. Results demonstrated that NA caused loss of cIAP1
and cIAP2 proteins and the XIAP protein level was also
reduced at the same time in these cell lines (Figure 2A).
IAP antagonists can induce loss of cIAP1 and cIAP2
by inducing their auto-ubiquitination and proteosomal
degradation. To address possible mechanisms of NAinduced loss of cIAP1 and 2, C666-1 and HK1 cells
were treated with NA in the absence or presence of the
proteasome inhibitor, MG132. The presence of MG132
efficiently blocked the NA-dependent decreases in
c-IAP1/2 protein levels (Figure 2B). NA exposure leading
to enhancement in cIAP1 and cIAP2 ubiquitination further
indicated that loss of cIAP1 and cIAP2 involves their
auto-ubiquitination (Figure 2C). TRAF2, an E3 ubiquitin
ligase, was originally identified as a cIAP1/2-binding
protein mediating IAP antagonist-induced degradation
of cellular cIAP1 [28-30]. Knockdown of TRAF2 in
L929 cells activated RIPK1-dependent TNFα production
and induced necroptosis. The protein levels of TRAF2
and TRAF6 were reduced in cancer cell lines treated
with NA, but not TRAF3, TRADD, and FADD (Figure
2D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NA
triggers auto-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal
degradation of cIAP1 and cIAP2.

The non-canonical NF-κB pathway has a key role
in NA-induced TNFα production and cell death
Researchers reported that RIPK1 and JNKs
mediated TNFα production in response to zVAD-fmk
and IAP antagonists [8, 9]. Thus, the roles of RIPK1 and
JNKs were analyzed to further investigate the molecular
mechanisms of TNFα production in NA-treated cells.
To determine how TNFα production is activated, we
used real-time PCR to measure TNFα mRNA levels

JNKs activation. JNKs activation might be a side effect
of NA stimulation. Therefore, these results implied that
RIPK1, but not JNKs, contributes to NA-induced TNFα
production.
Activation of the NF-κB pathway is usually thought
to promote cell survival. However, certain situations also
exist in which activation of NF-κB is pro-apoptotic and
might lead to the production of TNFα and FasL [35].
Both the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways
have been reported to participate in autocrine production
of TNFα in cancer cells [20, 21, 36]. We examined the
role of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways in
TNFα production after treatment with NA. The NF-κB
activation inhibitor (NAI) and BAY11-7082 (BAY11),
which are small molecular inhibitors of the canonical NFκB pathway, did not affect NA-induced transcription of
TNFα (Figure 4C). In addition, NAI and BAY11 could not
rescue the cells from death (Figure 4D). siRNA silencing

after NA treatment. Stimulation with NA increased
TNFα mRNA expression, and knockdown of RIPK1,
blocked the increase in TNFα mRNA level (Figure 4A).
Thus, RIPK1 activates the transcription of TNFα after
NA treatment. In a previous study, we found that NA
treatment could induce JNKs activation[24]. SP600125
(SP), a small molecular inhibitor of JNKs, was used to
verify the possibility that JNKs activation may trigger
autocrine production of TNFα. SP treatment could
not reduce TNFα transcription level induced by NA
(Supplementary Figure 2A). Furthermore, results showed
that knockdown of RIPK1 inhibited NA-induced TNFα
secretion (Figure 4B), demonstrating that RIPK1 is
required for TNFα production. In addition, inhibition of
JNKs by SP treatment failed to block NA-induced TNFα
production (Supplementary Figure 2B). Although JNKs
were phosphorylated and activated by NA treatment,
NA-induced TNFα secretion occurred independently of

NA-mediated ROS generation contributes to cell
death

of IKKα, a key molecule in the non-canonical NF-κB
pathway, down-regulated the transcription and secretion
levels of TNFα (Figure 4E, F). More importantly, NAinduced TNFα-dependent necrotic cell death was inhibited
by silencing IKKα (Figure 4G). Consistent with the
inhibition of the canonical pathway and promotion of the
non-canonical pathway, pro-survival and anti-apoptotic
genes regulated by canonical NF-κB were decreased
with NA treatment, whereas the IL-1α and IL-8 were upregulated (Supplementary Figure 3). Thus, these results
indicated that the non-canonical NF-κB pathway has a key
role in NA-induced TNFα production and cell death, and
after NA treatment, the secretome may also include other
factors that promote cell death, such as ILs.

Classically, execution of necroptosis has been
thought to involve ROS generation and mitochondrial
dysfunction [37, 38]. Here, we investigated whether ROS
participate in NA-induced cell death. Results showed
that the amount of ROS was markedly elevated by NA
treatment (Figure 5A). Pretreatment of C666-1 cells with
the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) decreased
ROS production (Figure 5A). NAC administration also
attenuated NA-induced cell death (Figure 5B), indicating
that ROS production contributed to NA-induced cell death.
RIPK3 is key regulator in energy metabolism-associated
ROS production, which partially accounts for RIPK3’s
ability to promote necrosis [39]. Knocking down RIPK3
reduced ROS production in NA-treated cells, whereas
treatment with the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1 had no effect

on ROS production induced by NA (Figure 5C). Knocking
down of IKKα did not change ROS production in NAtreated cells (Supplementary Figure 4A). This suggested
that ROS production independent from activation of the
non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Mitochondrial complex
I and complex III are major ROS-producing sites in
the electron transport chain (ETC). Several inhibitors
of energy metabolism were used to confirm that the
source of ROS originates from the mitochondria. The
mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, rotenone, reduced the
ROS production in NA-treated cells; but the complex
III inhibitor, antimycin, and the ATPase inhibitor,
olygomycin, had no effect (Figure 5D). Furthermore,
rotenone attenuated NA-induced cell death (Figure 5E).
Previous studies showed that besides mitochondria, the
activation of phospholipases/lipoxygenases (PLA2/LOX),
also contributes to ROS production, and consequently to
necrotic cell death [40]. The LOX inhibitor (AA861) and
PLA2 inhibitor (bromoenol lactone, BEL) were used to
exclude this possibility. AA861 and BEL had no effect
on ROS production in NA-exposed cells (Supplementary
Figure 4B) and NA-induced cell death was not changed by

AA861 and BEL (Supplementary Figure 4B). Collectively,
these data suggested that the mitochondrial complex I is
the main site for ROS generation and main contributor to
cell death in NA-treated cells.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we discovered that NA triggers
necroptosis by promoting autocrine secretion of TNFα
through the regulation of the RIPK/NF-κB signaling
pathway and RIPK3-dependent ROS production. NA
induces the proteasomal degradation of cIAPs that leads
to the de-ubiquitination of RIPK1 which activating
necroptosome to initiate necroptosis; meanwhile, loss
of cIAPs facilitates the stabilization of NIK, promoting
IKKα/IKKα activation and the processing of p100 to
p52 to activate non-canonical NF-κB pathway. The
non-canonical NF-κB-driven pathway up-regulates
specific target genes, including TNFα that is required
for NA-induced cell death. Surprisingly, NA reduced the
phosphorylation of p65 to inhibit the canonical NF-κB
pathway, providing the insight that NA not only activate

pro-survival signal of this pathway. Taken together, data
from this study suggest that NA is capable of inducing
necroptosis by these mechanisms (illustrated in Figure 6).
TNFα, a pleiotropic ligand of TNFR1/2, can signal
both cell survival and cell death based on the downstream
protein complexes constitutes. The ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and the interaction of RIPK1 with a
class of ubiquitin receptors control cell fate [41]. TNFα
is produced in two ways. First, TNFα can be produced
independent of the NF-κB pathway. Two independent
groups reported that TNFα could be triggered by zVAD
and IAP antagonists through the RIPK1/AP1 and PKC/
MAPKs/AP-1 pathways [8, 9]. The second means of
production is NF-κB pathway-dependent. Another group
reported that an IAP antagonist could activate NF-κB
signaling and induce TNFα production to kill tumor cells
[20, 21]. Depending on their response to IAP antagonists,
cells can be grouped into three general classes :1) IAP
antagonists induce autocrine TNFα production and
massive cell death; 2) IAP antagonists induce autocrine
TNFα production, but do not have a major effect on cell
viability; 3) IAP antagonists have no effect on autocrine
TNFα production or on cell death [20, 21, 36, 42, 43].
The ability of cells to produce TNFα is necessary but
not sufficient for IAP antagonists to induce cell death
as a single agent. Similar to IAP antagonists, which can
induce TNFα production through activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, NA activates the NF-κB
pathway to enhance TNFα production and cell death.
Two cellular events can result from cIAP degradation and
include activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway
with subsequently increased production of autocrine
TNFα and caspase-8/RIPK1/FADD complex formation.
Our results showed that NA activated the non-canonical
NF-κB pathway stimulating the transcription of TNFα, but
inhibited the canonical NF-κB pathway, which providing
survival force to cells under stress. Specifically, the use of
NA had the unintended, but fortuitous, effect of altering
the functional state of TNFα from one that signals through
the survival pathway to one that signals cell death. NAinduced TNFα autocrine production was only detected
in NA-sensitive cell lines and not in NA-resistant lines.
Why the TNFα-blocking antibody could not fully block
NA-induced tumor cell death needs to be studied in the
future. Although NA might influence other signaling
pathways apart from non-canonical NF-κB, the fact that
inhibition of non-canonical NF-κB signaling blocked
TNFα production and promoted tumor cell survival in
response to NA treatment suggests that non-canonical NFκB signaling is the major pathway by which NA triggers
TNFα production.
ROS has been implicated in TNFα-induced,
RIPK-dependent necrosis [26, 39]. However, literatures
suggest that cell-specific contexts might occur where the
mitochondrial and necroptotic pathways bisect to mediate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

necrosis. Multiple studies have shown that mitochondrial
ROS are critical in the execution of necroptosis in L929
cells [26, 44], whereas HT29 and U937 cells seem to
lack this requirement [45]. Disparate results have been
obtained in MEFs with ROS being both implicated in
[46] and dispensable for [47] necroptosis. Although ROS
production is not essential in all instances of necroptosis,
increasing mitochondrial ROS production can act as
second messengers in the signaling pathways leading to
cell death. Treatment with NAC abrogated NA-induced
ROS generation and cell death by necrosis, indicating
that an imbalance in the oxidative stress response might
be induced by NA. A previous study showed that RIPK3
physically interacts with and activates several metabolic
enzymes to trigger ROS production [39]. Here, we
observed that generation of ROS by NA also relies on
RIPK3, but not RIPK1, and the mitochondrial complex I
is the site for ROS generation. The relationship between
RIPK3 and the metabolic process in NA-treated cells
should be further investigated. Research results showed
that the anti-necrotic effect of BHA reflects not only its
ROS scavenging property, but also its ability to inhibit
LOXs [40]. Here, we found that NA-induced ROS
production is independent of PLA2 and LOXs. Taken
together, our results show that mitochondrial complex I is
the origin of ROS in NA-treated cells.
In summary, our study provides a mechanistic
explanation for the observed ability of NA to stimulate
cancer cell death and defines a novel biological role for
RIPK/NF-κB in the regulation of cellular signaling. To
further examine whether NA or other small-molecular
natural compounds possess similar effects in other cell
types, especially in apoptosis compromised human cancer
cells, will be interesting to examine in the future.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection
H2-DCFDA is widely used for ROS detection.
H2-DCFDA is a stable, nonpolar compound that readily
diffuses into cells and is hydrolyzed by nonspecific
esterases to DCFH. This nonfluorescent molecule is further
oxidized by ROS to form the fluorescent compound DCF.
The cells were incubated with 10 μM H2-DCFDA at 37°C
for 30 min, then harvested and the pellets suspended in 0.5
mL of PBS. ROS generation was measured as the increase
in green fluorescence intensity using the FL1 channel on
a Guava EasyCyte HT Sampling Flow Cytometer (Merck
Millipore, Billerica, MA).
