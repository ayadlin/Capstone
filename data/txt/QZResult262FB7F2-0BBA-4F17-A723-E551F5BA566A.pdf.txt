ABSTRACT
Epigenetic modifications, like histone acetylation, are essential for regulating
gene expression within cells. Cancer cells acquire pathological epigenetic modifications
resulting in gene expression patterns that facilitate and sustain tumorigenesis.
Epigenetic manipulation therefore is emerging as a novel targeted therapy for cancer.
Histone Acetylases (HATs) and Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) regulate histone
acetylation and hence gene expression. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are
well known to affect cancer cell viability and biology and are already in use for the
treatment of cancer patients. Immunotherapy can lead to clinical benefit in selected
cancer patients, especially in patients with limited disease after tumor debulking.
HDAC inhibitors can potentially synergize with immunotherapy by elimination of tumor
cells. The direct effects of HDAC inhibitors on immune cell function, however, remain
largely unexplored. Initial data have suggested HDAC inhibitors to be predominantly
immunosuppressive, but more recent reports have challenged this view. In this review
we will discuss the effects of HDAC inhibitors on tumor cells and different immune cell
subsets, synergistic interactions and possible mechanisms. Finally, we will address
future challenges and potential application of HDAC inhibitors in immunocombination
therapy of cancer.

INTRODUCTION

accumulation of genomic mutations/alterations but also
to changes in the epigenetic code, the epigenome[1].
The epigenome regulates the heritable patterns of
gene expression without changing the sequence of the
genome[2]. In cancer, alterations to the epigenome may
lead to gene expression profiles that support tumorigenesis
and thereby play an important role in cancer initiation
and progression[3-6]. Epigenetic changes can occur at
multiple levels including direct modifications of the DNA
itself as well as modifications of the DNA associated
histone proteins[7]. Histone proteins can be chemically
modified by acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation,
and ubiquitination[8]. Hyperacetylation of histone proteins
results in increased transcriptional activity, whilst histone
hypoacetylation is associated with repression of gene
transcription[9]. Hypoacetylation of histones was shown

Recent reports have demonstrated synergistic effects
of HDAC inhibitors with cancer immunotherapy. Whereas
the direct cytotoxic effects of HDAC inhibitors on cancer
cells are well known, the effects of HDAC inhibitors on
the immune system are less well understood. Here, we
review the effects of HDAC inhibitors on immune cell
function in relation to anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore,
we discuss the mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors in
combination with immunotherapy in the treatment of
patients with cancer and provide future directions for
research.

lines as well as in primary lymphoma and colon carcinoma
tissue samples[10].
Immunotherapy is a promising novel cancer
therapy for multiple cancer types, including melanoma
and neuroblastoma[11, 12]. Immunotherapy can lead to
clinical benefit and active anti-tumor immune responses
have been observed in selected patients[13]. However,
in most patients, the clinical response is still limited or
even absent following immunotherapy[14]. Accumulating
evidence indicates that tumors evade immune responses
by down regulation of MHC molecules and tumor
antigens or active suppression of anti-tumor immune
responses at the site of the tumor by creating an immune
suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME)[15-18].
Therefore, immunotherapy should best be combined
with other therapies in so-called immunocombination
therapy to overcome these tumor induced immune escape
mechanisms[19].
One potential type of therapies that could be
combined with immunotherapy are therapies that target
the epigenetic code. Epigenetic alterations are dynamic
and generally reversible and for this reason epigenetic
manipulation has emerged as an attractive novel treatment
for cancer[20]. Small molecule inhibitors were identified
that target the enzymes responsible for the deacetylation
of histones, the histone deacetylases (HDACs). These socalled HDAC inhibitors, are now regarded as a group of
anti-cancer drugs with high clinical potential[9, 21, 22].
Inhibition of HDACs leads to genomic effects through
accumulation of acetylated histone proteins, resulting in
altered gene transcription[23]. Specifically in cancer cells,
the altered gene transcription leads to, amongst others, the
activation of and/or sensitization to intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptosis pathways[24, 25]. Besides blocking the function
of HDACs leading to genomic effects, HDAC inhibitors
also modulate the function of many other proteins resulting
in non-genomic effects. For example, p53 becomes hyper
acetylated upon HDAC inhibitor treatment, resulting in
tumor cell apoptosis[26, 27]. Interestingly, tumor cells
appear much more sensitive to the induction of apoptosis
by HDAC inhibitors than normal cells, although the
responsible mechanisms are still not fully understood.
Besides changes in gene transcription other possible
mechanisms for the tumor specificity of HDAC inhibitors
have been suggested, e.g. induction of double-strand DNA
breaks[28]. Other reports link the selective sensitivity of
cancer cells to HDAC inhibitors relative to normal cells to
the disturbed chromatin structure in cancer cells[29].
The classical HDAC inhibitors inhibit the function
of one or more of the 11 known zinc-containing HDAC
enzymes. The zinc-containing HDAC enzymes can be
classified into several Classes: Class I HDAC (HDAC
1,2,3,8), Class IIA (HDAC 4,5,7,9) and Class IIB (HDAC
6,10). Class III HDACs or Sirtuins, have a different
catalytic mechanism and are not a target for the classical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HDAC inhibitors. The most recently discovered HDAC11
is the only Class IV HDAC[9]. PanHDAC inhibitors
inhibit HDACs from Class I, II and IV, while Class specific
HDAC inhibitors only inhibit HDACs from either Class I
or Class II. More recently, HDAC inhibitors preferentially
targeting a single HDAC have been developed[30, 31].
Because each individual HDAC inhibitor has a unique
chemical structure and HDAC inhibitory profile, different
HDAC inhibitors can cause a large variety of biological
effects in cancer cells and in normal cells[32, 33].
Although the effects of HDAC inhibitors on tumor
cells have been studied extensively, the exact role of
HDAC inhibitors on immune cells and in anti-tumor
immunity is just emerging. HDAC inhibitors were
previously reported to exhibit strong anti-inflammatory
effects[34-36]. Rapamycin, however, previously viewed as
a pure immune suppressant drug, was more recently also
shown to mediate strong immune stimulating effects as
reviewed in[37, 38]. Similarly, a recent study showed that
the Class I HDAC inhibitor Entinostat markedly enhanced
anti-tumor vaccination[39]. In this review we will discuss
the effects of classical pan-, Class I and Class II HDAC
inhibitors on tumor cells and immune cells in relation to
immunotherapy. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential
of combining HDAC inhibitors with immunotherapy as
immunocombination therapy for cancer.

Effects of HDAC inhibitors on tumor cells;
immunological consequences
HDAC inhibitors can induce tumor cell death
in a specific manner through various mechanisms and
with different half maximum inhibitory concentrations
(IC50s) as reviewed elsewhere[9, 22, 40]. However,
HDAC inhibitors also have profound effects on the
remaining viable tumor cells. Here we will discuss the
effects of HDAC inhibitors on the cell biology of these
surviving tumor cells with a focus on the immunological
consequences.

Effects of HDAC inhibitors on tumor cell
recognition by T cells and NK cells
Tumor cell recognition and elimination by tumor
specific T cells is, amongst others, dependent on the
expression levels of both tumor associated antigens
(TAAs) and MHC Class I (MHCI) molecules by the tumor
cells. HDAC inhibitors can increase TAA expression by
tumor cells. The Class I HDAC inhibitor Depsipeptide
enhanced the expression of the tumor antigen gp100 in
murine melanoma cells[41]. Combination treatment of
Depsipeptide and adoptive transfer of gp100-specific
cytotoxic T cells resulted in increased tumor killing
by transferred tumor specific CD8 T cells. However,
sometimes TAA-expression is downregulated after HDAC

inhibitor treatment. The panHDAC inhibitor Valproic acid
(VPA) downregulated the expression of the tumor antigen
Muc1. Remarkably, it upregulated another tumor antigen
NY-ESO-1 in mesothelioma cells in vitro[42].
Other reports have shown that HDAC inhibitors
upregulate genes involved in the antigen presentation
machinery or co-stimulatory molecule expression by
tumor cells[43, 44]. The panHDAC inhibitor Trichostatin
A (TSA) up-regulated MHCI surface expression in
a murine cervical cell line with an impaired antigenprocessing machinery[45]. TSA pre-treatment of these
tumor cells resulted in more effective lysis of these tumor
cells by CD8 T cells in vitro. Similarly, TSA was able to
increase or induce expression of TAP-1, TAP-2, LMP-2,
and Tapasin in TAP-expressing and TAP–deficient murine
tumor cell lines[46]. TSA treatment of mice bearing TAPdeficient tumors delayed tumor growth due to enhanced
tumor cell killing by adaptive immune effector cells. More
recently, the panHDAC inhibitor Panobinostat was shown
not only to enhance the expression of several TAAs, MHCI
and MHCII, but also the expression of co-stimulatory
molecules in several human and a murine melanoma cell
lines in vitro[47]. In addition, effective therapy of B16F10
melanoma bearing mice using Panobinostat was dependent
on the presence of the adaptive immune system. In another
study, TSA induced MHC Class II expression in murine
plasmacytoma cells through activation of the pIII-CIITA
promoter, resulting in enhanced proliferation of CD4
T cells in vitro[48]. In summary, HDAC inhibitors can
modulate TAA expression and many components of the
tumor antigen processing and MHC presentation pathway
in surviving tumor cells, overall resulting in enhanced
tumor cell recognition and killing by tumor specific T cells
(Table 1).
NK cells are innate immune cells that exert
important anti-tumor effector functions in cancer
immunotherapy[49]. The outcome of an interaction
between a tumor cell and a NK cell is balanced by the
expression of activating and inhibitory ligands by the
tumor cell. Several stress-induced activating ligands, like
MHC class I-related chain A (MICA) and B molecules
(MICB), and UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs), expressed
by tumor cells are recognized by the activating NKG2D
receptor on NK cells[50]. HDAC inhibitors were shown
to increase the expression of activating ligands for this NK
cell receptor by tumor cells. The Class I HDAC inhibitor
VPA induced the expression of MICA, MICB and ULBPs
in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulting in
enhanced recognition and killing by NK cells in vitro[51].
Importantly, in non-malignant primary human hepatocytes,
VPA treatment did not induce the expression of these
NKG2D ligands. Although the mechanisms for the tumor
specific induction of NKG2D ligands remained unclear,
this study confirms the selective effect of this panHDAC
inhibitor on the expression of NK cell activating ligands
by malignant cells. Lopez-Soto et al. showed that TSA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increased the expression of ULBPs in epithelial tumor
cells by releasing HDAC3 mediated repression on ULBP
promotors[52]. Similar effects have been reported for
other panHDAC inhibitors when added to osteosarcoma,
leukemia and Ewing sarcoma cell lines in vitro and to
primary myeloid leukemia cells ex vivo[53-56]. These
studies collectively show that panHDAC inhibitors can
increase the expression of activating NKG2D ligands
resulting in enhanced tumor cell recognition and
elimination by NK cells.
HDAC inhibitors, however, do not always increase
tumor cell recognition by immune cells. Fiegler et al.
showed that the panHDAC inhibitor Vorinostat and
other panHDAC inhibitors down regulated the B7 family
member B7-H6, a ligand for the activating NKp30
receptor on NK cells, in multiple human cancer cell lines,
both at the mRNA and protein level[57]. The decreased
surface expression of B7-H6 resulted in decreased
degranulation of primary NK cells in an NKp30 dependent
manner. Thus, HDAC inhibitors can also mediate the
downregulation of activating ligands for NK cells by
tumor cells. Furthermore, HDAC inhibitor induced
increased MHCI expression, leading to increased tumor
cell recognition by T cells, at the same time will negatively
affect NK cell recognition. Besides lymphocytic NK
and T cells, macrophages and other myeloid cells are
also able to recognize and kill tumor cells directly[58].
However, the effects of HDAC inhibitors on tumor cell
recognition by myeloid cells have not been reported to
date. We conclude that, in general, HDAC inhibitors lead
to enhanced recognition and elimination of tumor cells by
effector lymphocytes, but this effect may vary between
tumor types and HDAC inhibitors used.

HDAC inhibitors and immunogenic cell death
Selected chemotherapeutics can induce so-called
“immunogenic cell death”, a process in which dying tumor
cells can stimulate cellular uptake, activation and crosspresentation by antigen presenting cells (APCs), thereby
inducing antitumor T cell responses[59]. Christiansen et al.
showed that MC38 colon carcinoma cells, treated with the
panHDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, were efficiently taken up
by dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro[60]. In addition, in other
studies, Vorinostat stimulated the release of important
mediators of immunogenic cell death, like HMGB1 and
ATP, as well as the expression of cell surface Calreticulin,
an important ‘eat-me’ signal, by dying tumor cells[61, 62].
However, the precise role of immunogenic cell death upon
Vorinostat therapy in vivo was not investigated in these
studies. AK7 pancreatic carcinoma cells, pretreated with
Vorinostat or other cytotoxic drugs, have also been used
together with the adjuvant BCG as a vaccine. Only the
vaccine consisting of the Vorinostat treated tumor cells
was able to inhibit tumor growth upon tumor challenge
and resulted in increased CD8 T cell infiltration in this
6561

Oncotarget

experimental setting[63]. These studies imply that
Vorinostat, like a subset of chemotherapeutic compounds,
induces a form of cell death with immunogenic properties.
It remains to be determined whether other panHDAC or
Class specific HDAC inhibitors also induce immunogenic
cell death. Furthermore, it will be interesting to
compare the potency of Vorinostat and other HDAC
inhibitors to induce immunogenic cell death with that
of chemotherapeutic agents previously demonstrated to
induce immunogenic cell death[64].

TSA and the panHDAC inhibitor Panobinostat increased
IL-12 production in peritoneal elicitated macrophages,
which was associated with a downregulation of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10[70]. One explanation for
these different findings could be that the timing of HDAC
inhibitor exposure differed between these studies: in the
first studies the APCs were exposed to the HDAC inhibitor
one hour before the immune stimulus, whereas in the
latter study the HDAC inhibitor and the immune stimulus
were administered together. These observations suggest
that the pre-activation of these APCs leads to differential
effects upon HDAC inhibitor treatment. Also, in contrast
to the panHDAC inhibitor TSA, the Class I specific
HDAC inhibitor Entinostat did not down regulate IL-12
mRNA in BMDM, suggesting Entinostat may prevent
the reduced production of IL-12 in these APCs[71]. In
addition, HDAC6 was required for the production of IL10 in murine APCs, suggesting panHDAC and Class II
HDAC inhibitors may downregulate IL-10 production by
APCs[72].
Support for a role of individual HDACs in the
initiation of inflammatory cytokine production by
APCs comes from studies using HDAC3-/- murine
BMDM. These cells were shown to be incapable of a
pro-inflammatory gene response when stimulated with
LPS[73]. The lack of expression of pro-inflammatory
genes could be largely explained by a lack of IFN-β
expression in these macrophages. This was most
probably due to the constitutive over expression of
Cox-1 in the se macrophages, which interfered with
pro-inflammatory signaling cascades. In addition, other
studies have reported on panHDAC inhibitor mediated
downregulation of systemic inflammation by reducing
pro-inflammatory cytokine production in mice[34, 35, 7477]. Similar suppressive effects of HDAC inhibitors on
pro-inflammatory cytokine production were also reported
for human macrophages and DCs[76, 78-81]. In human
monocyte derived DCs, the reduced cytokine production
upon HDAC inhibitor exposure was suggested to be
mediated through decreased NF-kB and type I interferon
signaling as suggested by the reduced nuclear translocation
of NF-kB RelB, IRF-3 and IRF-8[82]. Similarly, upon
exposure to Panobinostat, RelB was down-regulated in
a dose-dependent manner in human monocyte derived
DCs[83]. Cytokine production by immune cells was also
reduced upon administration of the panHDAC inhibitor
Givinostat to healthy human subjects[84]. Givinostat
treatment reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine
production by endotoxin stimulated PBMC, four hours
after Givinostat administration ex vivo. Twelve hours after
Givinostat administration, however, cytokine production
by the PBMC had already returned to baseline levels,
suggesting a transient reduction in cytokine production.
This observation was in agreement with the half-life of
Givinostat of around 6 hours as determined in the same
study. This transient reduction of pro-inflammatory

Effect of HDAC inhibitors on immune cells
So far, we discussed the effects of HDAC
inhibitors on tumor cell biology and the immunological
consequences. In the next paragraphs we will review
the effects of HDAC inhibitors on immune cell viability
and function and address the mechanisms and critical
factors of successful combinations of HDAC inhibitors
and immunotherapy in vivo. Immune cells can have both
pro- and anti-tumor effects, depending on cell lineage and
environmental cues. For example, in a recent study by
West et al, successful treatment of MC38 colon carcinoma
tumors using the panHDAC inhibitors Vorinostat and
Panobinostat was fully dependent on the presence of an
intact immune system[61].

Effect of HDAC inhibitors on antigen presenting
cells and cytokine production
In order to generate effective and long-lasting
immune responses, activation of both the innate and
adaptive arms of the immune system is required. APCs,
like monocytes, macrophages and DCs are the first
innate immune cells to sense danger signals coming
from foreign or damaged self[65]. Upon encounter of
these signals, APCs become activated and start to recruit
and activate other immune cells and thereby initiate
antigen specific immunity[66]. DCs are professional
APCs and are therefore especially capable of inducing
adaptive immunity. Besides signal 1 coming from specific
recognition of antigens presented in MHCI and MHCII
molecules, co-stimulatory and cytokine signals (signals
2 and 3, respectively) are required to initiate and direct
adaptive immune responses[67].
HDAC inhibitors were repeatedly shown to down
regulate both co-stimulatory and cytokine signals coming
from APCs. The panHDAC inhibitors Vorinostat and
TSA profoundly down-regulated genes involved in costimulation and the production of cytokines in murine
bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) and dendritic
cells (BMDC)[68, 69]. Upon treatment with TSA, surface
expression of CD40, CD80, CD86 and CCR7 as well as
the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12
and TNF-α was down regulated in BMDC[69]. In contrast,

cytokine production following Givinostat treatment,
could imply that the timing of HDAC inhibitor treatment
may be crucial when combining HDAC inhibitors with
immunotherapy (Figure 1). In this respect, short pulses
of Givinostat might circumvent prolonged immune
suppression in immunocombination therapy regimens.
Overall, these data suggest that HDAC inhibitors suppress
macrophage and DC functions in terms of reduced
expression of co-stimulatory molecules and reduced
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
The effect of HDAC inhibitors on the (cross-)
presentation of antigens by APCs has not been studied
extensively. TSA reduced the capacity of murine BMDC to
induce T cell proliferation in mixed-lymphocyte-reactions,
but the contribution of antigen (cross-)presentation was
not investigated[85].
Besides
down-regulating
pro-inflammatory
cytokines, HDAC inhibitors can also reduce the production
of pro-tumorigenic soluble factors or cytokines. Vorinostat
reduced the production of the tumorigenic factors Nitric
Oxide (NO) and M-CSF & MMP-9 by murine peritoneal
macrophages and primary mammary tumor cells,
respectively[86]. Administration of Vorinostat delayed
tumor onset in a spontaneous mammary tumor model,
which was associated with reduced numbers of tumor

infiltrating macrophages. Similarly, several panHDAC
inhibitors reduced the production of the tumorigenic
cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)
in several human cancer cell lines as well as in mouse
blood[87]. These studies suggest that the production of
tumorigenic cytokines or other soluble factors by myeloid
cells and tumor cells are also reduced upon panHDAC
inhibitor treatment. The net outcome of HDAC inhibitor
treatment on anti-tumor immune responses will likely
be a delicate balance in the production of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines and other soluble factors in the
blood, lymphoid organs and, more importantly, locally in
the tumor.

on

effector

CD4 T cells are essential in the induction of
adaptive anti-tumor immunity by maintaining and skewing
immune responses[88-90]. HDAC inhibitors were
reported to have inhibitory effects on CD4 T cell viability
and function. The panHDAC inhibitor TSA inhibited
PMA/Ionomycin induced NF-kB nuclear translocation
in murine CD4 T cells after 8 hours and impaired their
viability after 20 hours in vitro[91]. TSA also potently
decreased the antigen specific proliferation of murine
CD4 T cells, which was associated with upregulation of
the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 p21Cip1[92, 93]. In
human CD4 T cells, Vorinostat had limited to no effect
on viability and the expression of genes involved in
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis after a 24 hour
exposure period[94]. These opposite observations may be
species related or due to intrinsic differences between the
panHDAC inhibitors used in these studies. Indeed, the
panHDAC inhibitor TSA has a higher inhibitory potency
for most of the individual HDACs compared to Vorinostat,
which could explain the more pronounced effects of TSA
in the murine CD4 T cells[95-97]. In patients treated with
the Class I HDAC inhibitor Romidepsin, the percentages
of CD4 and CD8 T cells in patient’s blood were decreased
by around 50%[98]. In a study by Schmudde et al,
Vorinostat affected the proliferation and function of naïve
human PBMC and T cells, but not of IL-2 pre-activated
PBMC or previously primed T cells[99]. These studies
suggest that pan- and Class I HDAC inhibitors reduce
the viability and function of naive CD4 T cells, thus
hampering the induction of anti-tumor T cell responses.
The inhibitory effect of HDAC inhibitors, however, seems
less severe or absent following activation of these CD4+
lymphocytes. Therefore, the timing of HDAC inhibitor
administration in combination with immunotherapy could
critically determine the outcome of immunocombination
therapy, combining HDAC inhibitors with immunotherapy
(Figure 1).
For effective anti-tumor immunity the function

HDAC inhibitor administration and the type of HDAC inhibitor
used, determine the effect on the various types of immune cells
and their interactions. Therefore, these are emerging factors

of cytotoxic CD8 T cells is of crucial importance[13].
Several studies suggest HDAC inhibitors enhance the
function of this CD8+ T cell subset. Treatment of mice
with the panHDAC inhibitor Panobinostat resulted
in increased serum levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α and
an accelerated graft-versus-host disease, which was
associated with higher numbers of CD8 T cells in the
affected organs[100]. Strikingly, in murine CD8 T cells,
the panHDAC inhibitor TSA mimicked the effect of
the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IFN-α at the
level of gene expression[101]. TSA up-regulated genes
involved in CD8 T cell activation and memory similar
to those induced by these pro-inflammatory cytokines.
This finding suggests that part of the immune inhibitory
effect of HDAC inhibitors on pro-inflammatory cytokine
production by APC may be compensated by the direct
induction of a set of genes in these effector lymphocytes.
Murine memory CD8 T cells were capable of producing
IFN-γ only when CD4 T cell help was present during
priming[102]. Interestingly, only in these CD8 T cell
memory cells, the IFN-γ locus was hyper acetylated,
allowing for the rapid production of IFN-γ. More recently,
the function of exhausted CD8 T cells in chronic viral
infection was shown to be restored upon treatment with
panHDAC inhibitors[103]. The effect of Class II HDAC
inhibitors on CD4 and CD8 T cells have not been reported
to date. These studies collectively suggest that panHDAC
inhibitors have the ability to stimulate CD8 T cell
activation and function.
Although HDAC inhibitor treated tumor cells are
more efficiently recognized by effector NK cells, not much
is known regarding the effects of HDAC inhibitors on NK
cell function itself. Ogbomo et al. first showed that the
Class I HDAC inhibitor VPA and the panHDAC inhibitor
Vorinostat inhibited the proliferation and cytotoxic
capacity of human NK cells, treated with IL-2 and the
HDAC inhibitor simultaneously[104]. The NK cells down
regulated the expression of activating receptors on the cell
surface upon Vorinostat exposure. In another study, upon
exposure to similar concentrations of Vorinostat, NK cells
were still able to degranulate upon co-culture with tumor
cells[99]. The NK cells from the latter study, however,
had received the activating cytokine three days prior to
the addition of the HDAC inhibitor and were thus preactivated. These studies imply that IL-2 pre-activated NK
cells retain their functionality whereas NK cells receiving
IL-2 simultaneous with the HDAC inhibitor show reduced
functionality. In a more recent study, the Class I HDAC
inhibitor Entinostat increased the expression of the
activating receptor NKG2D in IL-2 and IL-21 activated
as well as in freshly isolated human NK cells. Entinostat
also increased the expression of NKG2D ligands on
human tumor cell lines, but not on normal cells, in this
study[105]. Furthermore, Entinostat treated NK cells
showed increased cytotoxicity upon co-culture with tumor
cells and the combination of Entinostat treatment and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

adoptive NK cell transfer resulted in synergistic inhibition
of tumor growth in vivo. Thus, the Class I HDAC inhibitor
Entinostat increased activating ligand expression by tumor
cells as well as NK cell cytotoxicity. The effects of Class
II HDAC inhibitors on NK cells have not been reported to
date. These studies suggest that panHDAC inhibitors have
distinct effects on NK cells, at least partially depending on
their activation status, whereas Class I HDAC inhibition
seems to enhance NK cell function.
In conclusion, HDAC inhibitors can either inhibit or
promote effector lymphocyte function depending on the
cell type, activation status and the type of HDAC inhibitor
used.

Effect of HDAC inhibitors on regulatory immune
cells
After induction of effective immunity through
activation of both innate and adaptive arms of the immune
system, feedback loops are in place to control the ongoing
inflammation. Specialized immune cells like CD4+
regulatory T cells (Treg) and specific subsets of regulatory
myeloid cells can actively dampen immune responses.
Tumors actively recruit Treg, myeloid derived suppressor
cells (MDSC) and tumor associated macrophages (TAM)
[106]. These immune cells all contribute to an immune
suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), abrogating
anti-tumor immune responses.
Several panHDAC inhibitors were shown to
promote the expansion and function of CD4+ Treg in
multiple mouse studies, often after prolonged daily
administrations of panHDAC inhibitors[107-111]. HDAC
6 and HDAC9, both Class II HDAC enzymes, were shown
to be expressed by murine CD4+FoxP3+ Treg and acted as
inhibitors of the suppressive function of these regulatory
immune cells[107, 112, 113]. HDAC9-/- mice showed
increased numbers of Treg with increased suppressive
capacity[112]. In line with these observations, exposure
to Class II HDAC inhibitors was repeatedly shown to
directly enhance the suppressive function of murine
Treg[113-115]. These studies demonstrate that Class II
HDAC enzymes are important regulators of Treg function
and that Class II HDAC inhibition results in increased
Treg functionality. The effect of Class I HDAC inhibition
on Treg proliferation and function is less clear. The Class
I HDAC inhibitor Entinostat enhanced Treg numbers and
FoxP3 expression by Treg[116, 117]. In another study,
however, the numbers of Treg were equal and FoxP3
expression by the Treg was down-regulated following
Entinostat treatment, leading to improved anti-tumor
vaccination in vivo[118]. In addition, Bridle et al. showed
both reduced Treg numbers as well as reduced FoxP3
expression in Treg upon Entinostat treatment[39]. These
studies collectively indicate that pan- and Class II HDAC
inhibitors enhance Treg numbers and function, whereas

in vivo

Class I HDAC inhibitors show more complex effects on
Treg, including decreased numbers and function, that need
to be studied in more detail. In this respect, Class I HDAC
or panHDAC inhibitors might be more suited to combine
with immunotherapy than Class II HDAC inhibitors
(Figure 1).
MDSC are immature myeloid cells that can
actively suppress T cell responses and contribute to
an immune suppressive TME[106, 119]. Murine bone
marrow precursor cells cultured for 7 days in the
presence of GM-CSF & TSA or GM-CSF alone, revealed
striking differences in myeloid cell differentiation. The
presence of the panHDAC inhibitor TSA throughout
this culture period resulted in the accumulation of a
pool of undifferentiated myeloid cells. These cells were
CD11b(+)Ly6C(+)F4/80(int)CD115(+) and showed
immune suppressive properties in vitro, thus mimicking
MDSC[120]. Treatment of naïve mice with GM-CSF
and TSA resulted in a similar accumulation of CD11b(+)
Gr1(+) cells in the spleens of these mice, showing immune
suppressive activity ex vivo. Youn et al. showed that the
Class I HDAC inhibitor VPA could differentiate tumor
induced MDSC into macrophages and DC following in
vitro culture[121]. These MDSC were isolated from the
BM of tumor bearing mice and cultured with GM-CSF
and tumor conditioned medium in the presence or absence
of VPA. Thus, panHDAC inhibition affects myeloid cell
differentiation from precursors towards MDSC, whereas
Class I inhibition directs MDSC to more differentiated
macrophages and DC. In the latter study, the Rb1 gene
was shown to regulate the differentiation from MDSC
to macrophages and DC. Rb1 expression in turn was
regulated by HDAC2, showing a role for HDAC2 in
MDSC differentiation. The effects of Class II specific
HDAC inhibitors on MDSC have not been reported.
TAM expressing low levels of MHCII also
accumulate in tumors and are associated with tumor
progression[122]. Similarly to MDSCs, TAM have been
reported to be sensitive to the Class I HDAC inhibitor
VPA and the panHDAC inhibitor TSA, resulting in
restoration of MHC class II expression, reversal of
immune suppression and delayed tumor growth[123, 124].
The effects of Class II specific HDAC inhibitors on TAM
have not been reported.
Overall, the available data suggest that the effect
of HDAC inhibitors on regulatory immune cells differ
between the immune cell type studied, the differentiation
status and the HDAC inhibitor used. The precise effects of
HDAC inhibitors on myeloid cells in cancer, like MDSC
and TAM, deserve further exploration.

HDAC inhibitors can impact the immune cascade by
influencing different cell types in various life-cycle stages
including activation, differentiation, and proliferation.
The complex interactions of immune cells in this cascade
makes the influence of HDAC inhibitors on the overall
outcome of an immune response difficult to predict. In the
tumor setting, the growing tumor influences the various
immune cells locally and systemically, which further
increases the complexity. Thus, the effect of HDAC
inhibitor treatment combined with immunotherapy
should be investigated by the use of autologous and
immunocompetent preclinical models.
As can be concluded from previous sections, HDAC
inhibitors can have immune suppressive as well as immune
stimulating effects in vitro. There are not many studies
reporting on detrimental effects of HDAC inhibitors in
combination with cancer immunotherapy in vivo. HDAC
inhibitors, however, have been used to limit cytokine
production and immune damage in autoimmune diseases,
for example in rheumatoid arthritis[78, 125]. The few
studies that have reported synergistic effects of treatments
combining HDAC inhibitors and immunotherapy in the
treatment of cancer, will be discussed here.
The panHDAC inhibitors Vorinostat or Panobinostat
showed a synergistic effect in combination with the
immune cell stimulating antibodies anti-CD40 and antiCD137 in immunocompetent models of mammary, renal
and colon carcinoma[60]. This synergistic inhibition of
tumor growth was highly dependent on CD8 T cells. Vo
et al. demonstrated that the panHDAC inhibitor LAQ824
potentiated both adoptive transfers of tumor specific T
cells as well as a prime/boost vaccination scheme in mice
bearing B16 melanoma tumors[126]. The authors showed
that the adoptively transferred T cells were more abundant
in the tumor when LAQ824 was co-administered. Similar
to what has been reported in vitro[99], naïve T cells
were more sensitive to LAQ824 mediated cell death in
vivo, suggesting a survival advantage of the transferred
CD8 T cells. In addition, upon LAQ824 treatment, the
tumor cells expressed higher levels of the tumor antigen
gp100 and MHCI presenting molecules, implying
enhanced recognition by the tumor specific T cells. The
adoptively transferred T cells in LAQ824 treated mice
produced higher levels of IFN-γ upon re-stimulation
ex vivo, indicating also direct enhancement of CD8 T
cell function by this HDAC inhibitor. In addition to the
panHDAC inhibitor LAQ824, also the Class I inhibitor
Entinostat showed synergistic anti-tumor effects when
combined with IL-2 in mice bearing established RENCA
tumors[127]. This synergistic effect was also dependent
on the presence of CD8 T cells. More recently, Bridle et al
showed that administration of Entinostat enhanced tumor
specific T cell function only when Entinostat was given at
6565

Oncotarget

the time of the booster vaccination, but not at the prime
vaccination[39]. Surprisingly, the tumor specific CD8 T
cell expansion was not enhanced directly by Entinostat in
this study. Instead, Entinostat enhanced functionality of
the tumor specific CD8 T cells by creating a prolonged
state of lymphopenia following vaccination. The selective
elimination of unwanted precursor lymphocytes from the
BM resulted in tumor specific CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes
exhibiting enhanced functionality. This study elegantly
shows that the timing of HDAC inhibitor treatment is
essential for the combination with immunotherapy in order
to boost anti-tumor immune responses. Taken together,
these studies indicate that carefully designed regimens
of HDAC inhibitor treatment and immunotherapy
have the potential to be synergistic in the treatment of
cancer. The underlying mechanisms of these successful
immunocombination therapies are, however, complex
and diverse and may include direct tumor cell killing,
reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment as well
as different effects on innate and adaptive immune cells
like depletion of bystander lymphocytes and activation of
effector lymphocytes.

CONCLUSIONS
DIRECTIONS

AND

the mechanisms of such synergistic combinations will
be instrumental to efficiently translate these findings
into effective immunocombination therapies for cancer
patients.

FUTURE

Although HDAC inhibitors have negative/
detrimental effects on immune cell viability and
function, increasing evidence also supports a rationale
to combine HDAC inhibitors with immunotherapy to
obtain synergistic anti-tumor effects. HDAC inhibitors
induce tumor cell specific apoptosis already resulting in
tumor debulking. Selective elimination of tumor cells also
reduces the tumor induced immune suppression and makes
the tumor more accessible for immune cells. In addition,
HDAC inhibitors can increase tumor cell recognition by
NK and T cells. More recently, it was shown that HDAC
inhibitors can have both stimulatory as well as detrimental
effects on immune cell viability and function, depending
on cell type and activation status. Timing is therefore
emerging as a crucial factor in obtaining synergistic
effects with immunotherapy (Figure 1). For example,
based on present data, the administration of HDAC
inhibitors should take place following immune activation/
CD8 T cell priming, as activated lymphocytes seem less
affected and CD8 T cells become more activated by
HDAC inhibitors. Besides timing, the Class of the HDAC
inhibitor is very important. Inhibition or downregulation
of Class II HDACs enhanced Treg numbers and function,
whereas the Class I HDAC inhibitor Entinostat enhanced
NK cell and CD8 T cell functions. Finally, due to the vast
complexity of molecular and cellular events, rational
combination therapies of immunotherapy with HDAC
inhibitors should be designed and tested using autologous
and immunocompetent preclinical models, to elucidate
the complex underlying mechanisms. Understanding
