BACKGROUND: Tumor-related temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has a high likelihood of medical intractability
and requires surgical treatment. The aims of this study were to analyze the long-term surgical outcomes of
and to present appropriate surgical strategies for tumor-related TLE. METHODS: The clinical data of 87
consecutive patients diagnosed with tumor-related TLE were analyzed. The median age at surgery was 22
years. Sixteen patients had a tumor confined to the amygdala or the parahippocampal gyrus, and 10 of
them received a tailored lesionectomy without hippocampectomy. The surgical outcome was evaluated
based on 3 aspects: seizure control, tumor control, and discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
RESULTS: The actuarial seizure and tumor control rates at the fifth year postoperatively were 79% and
90%, respectively. Seizure control was highly correlated with tumor control. The following factors were
found to be significantly associated with poor seizure control: duration of epilepsy >10 years, presence of a
remote focus on surface electroencephalography, and incomplete tumor removal. The actuarial AED maintenance rates were 47% at the second year and 11% at the fifth year. The median time to AED discontinuation was 22 months. A younger age at surgery was found to be significantly associated with an increased
chance of AED discontinuation. Tailored resection focusing on the tumor resulted in a favorable outcome,
even for tumors confined to the amygdala or the parahippocampal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of tumor-related TLE resulted in long-term seizure control in the majority of patients. Maximal tumor

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the prototype of the surgically remediable epilepsy syndromes.
Approximately 10% to 30% of TLE cases are associated with a brain tumor, the majority of which are lowgrade glial tumors.1,2 Tumor-related TLE has a high likelihood of medical intractability, and early surgical
treatment is recommended.3

The surgical outcomes for tumor-related TLE are
comparable to those for TLE with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS); adequate seizure control can be achieved in
>80% of the patients.4,5 However, the long-term control
of seizures and of the tumor is a concern in these patients,
and to the best of our knowledge, very few longitudinal
analyses have been reported in the literature. Furthermore, data regarding the discontinuation of antiepileptic
drugs (AEDs) after surgery for tumor-related TLE are
scarce.
The extent of surgery necessary in tumor-related epilepsy has been controversial. In tumor-related TLE, the
tumor’s anatomic proximity to and even involvement of
the mesial temporal lobe, which is the most epileptogenic
structure in the human brain, render it more difficult to
determine the optimal surgical extent.6,7 In the current
study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes
of 87 patients with tumor-related TLE. We estimated the
actuarial seizure control rates and analyzed the relevant
prognostic variables related to seizure control and AED
discontinuation in these patients. In addition, we investigated the effects of the anatomic location of tumors and of
the extent of surgery on the seizure outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We selected patients who had surgery at the epilepsy surgery program of the Seoul National University Hospital
from 1995 to 2006, based on a diagnosis of focal epilepsy
with a primary brain tumor in the temporal lobe. A minimum postoperative follow-up of 1 year was required. We
excluded patients with an extra-axial tumor or a malignant
tumor that corresponded to World Health Organization
grade 3 or 4. Eighty-seven patients were included in this
study. The clinical and radiologic data of the patients
were retrospectively reviewed. This study was approved by
the institutional review board of the Seoul National University Hospital.
Forty-nine patients were male, and 38 were female.
The median age at surgery was 22 years (range, 1-62
years). The median age at seizure onset was 14 years
(range, 4 months-62 years). The mean duration of epilepsy was 66 months (range, 1 month-48 years). The
patients received a comprehensive presurgical evaluation
5772

that consisted of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
interictal surface electroencephalography (EEG), ictal
video-EEG monitoring, positron emission tomography,
single-photon emission tomography, and neuropsychologic tests. Fifty-one (59%) patients received the Wada
test for determination of language and memory
lateralization.

Seizure Characteristics and EEG Findings
Seventy-six (87%) patients had complex partial seizures,
and 13 (15%) patients demonstrated simple partial seizures. Secondary generalization was documented in 55
(63%) patients. The mean seizure frequency was 32 seizures/month (range, 0.2-600 seizures/month). The mean
number of AEDs taken by the patients at the time of the
surgery was 1.7 (range, 1-4 AEDs).
Interictal surface EEG was available for review for
60 patients. Interictal EEG was localized to the affected
temporal lobe in 29 (48%) patients, to the contralateral
temporal lobe in 1 (2%) patient, to the bilateral temporal
lobes in 3 (5%) patients, and to the affected temporal lobe
and an extratemporal lobe in 4 (7%) patients. It was nonlocalizable in 23 (38%) patients. Ictal video-EEG monitoring was available for review for 51 patients. Ictal EEG
was localized to the affected temporal lobe in 36 (71%)
patients, to the bilateral temporal lobes in 2 (4%) patients,
and to the affected temporal lobe and other foci in 9
(18%) patients. Ictal EEG was nonlocalizable in 4 (8%)
patients.
Invasive EEG was obtained for 7 patients using grids
and strips. Six patients had a tumor in the lateral temporal
lobe (4 were anterolateral and 2 were posterolateral), and
1 had a tumor in the mesial temporal lobe. The surgical
extent was eventually extended in 6 patients according to
the results of the invasive EEG analysis.

Tumors
Fifty-seven (66%) patients had a brain tumor in the left
temporal lobe, and 30 (34%) patients had a tumor in the
right temporal lobe. Tumor location was divided into the
mesial, anterolateral, and posterior temporal lobes (Fig.
1). Forty-nine (56%) tumors were located in the mesial
temporal lobe, 25 (29%) tumors were located in the anterolateral temporal lobe, and 13 (15%) tumors were

found in the posterior temporal lobe. Dysembryoplastic
neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) and ganglioglioma were
the most common tumors, and were diagnosed in
29 (33%) and 25 (28%) patients, respectively. The pathologic diagnoses of the tumors are summarized in Table 1.

Dual Pathology
Concomitant atrophy and high signal intensity in the hippocampus in fluid attenuated inversion recovery images
(dual pathology) were detected on preoperative MRI in 8
patients. The abnormal hippocampus was located on the
same side as the tumor in all patients. Five patients had a
tumor in the mesial temporal lobe, mainly in the parahippocampal gyrus, and 3 had a tumor in the anterolateral
temporal lobe. One patient with a tumor in the dominant
anterolateral temporal lobe underwent invasive monitoring, and ictal EEG was localized to the ipsilateral mesial
temporal lobe. Invasive monitoring was not performed
for the other 2 patients with a tumor in the nondominant
anterolateral temporal lobe.
In all 8 patients, both the tumor and the abnormal
hippocampus were removed simultaneously, regardless of
the tumor extent. Hippocampal sclerosis was confirmed
on pathological examination in 7 patients.
Cancer

The extent of surgery was determined based on several factors: tumor location and structures involved, laterality of
the lesion (dominant or nondominant hemisphere), imaging evidence of dual pathology, and electrophysiologic
evidence of other epileptogenic zones (Fig. 2).
In 16 patients, the tumor was confined to the amygdala or to the parahippocampal gyrus (in 11 patients and
5 patients, respectively), without apparent involvement of
the hippocampus. In a dominant hemisphere, the hippocampus was preserved, unless tailored lesionectomy was
technically difficult. In a nondominant hemisphere, the
entire mesial temporal lobe was removed.

Outcome Evaluation and Statistical
Analyses
In all patients, the extent of surgery and degree of tumor
removal were evaluated using MRI results recorded within
3 months postoperatively. Macroscopic total resection
was achieved in 74 (85%) patients. No adjuvant treatment
was immediately given to the patients with an incompletely resected tumor, except for 1 patient with a large residual oligodendroglioma who received postoperative
radiotherapy. AEDs were prescribed to the patients as preoperatively and were tapered down after the patients
became seizure free. The mean follow-up period was

54 months (range, 12-128 months). Three treatment outcomes were measured: seizure control, tumor control, and
AED discontinuation. The status of seizure control was
evaluated by chart review and was classified according to
Engel’s classification.8 The factors affecting seizure control and AED discontinuation were analyzed using the
Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards
model. The significance level applied was 5%. Patientrelated factors (sex, age at seizure onset, duration of epilepsy, age at surgery, secondary generalization, multiple
ictal foci on EEG, and dual pathology on MRI), tumorrelated factors (laterality, mesial/anterolateral/posterior
location, and tumor involvement), and treatment-related
factors (degree of tumor resection and extent of surgery)
were included in the analyses.

RESULTS

FIGURE 3. Kaplan-Meier plots illustrate the crude cumulative
incidences of (A) seizure control and (B) tumor control. The
actuarial seizure control rates were 92%, 86%, and 79%,
respectively, at the first, second, and fifth years. Seizure control and tumor control were found to be highly correlated
(odds ratio, 10.1; P ¼ .002 [Fisher exact test]).

Seizure Outcome
In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of overall seizure
control, the endpoint was defined as the time when
seizure recurred after surgery. The actuarial seizure
control rates were 92% at the first year, 86% at the
second year, and 79% at the fifth year postoperatively
(Fig. 3A).

In univariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model, the same 4 factors were found to be significantly associated with seizure outcomes (Table 2).
Multivariate analyses performed using the same model
demonstrated that a duration of epilepsy of 10 years,
the presence of a remote focus on surface EEG, and failure
of total tumor removal were significantly associated with
poor seizure outcomes, and that tumor location in the
mesial temporal lobe was marginally correlated with
improved seizure outcome (Table 2).

Tumor recurrence was observed in 8 patients. The
initial pathologic diagnoses were DNET, pleomorphic
xanthoastrocytoma, ganglioglioma, and oligodendroglioma (2 cases for each). Although DNETs are known to
have a low recurrence potential, 2 of 4 patients with
incomplete removal of a DNET experienced disease
recurrence after 20 months and 29 months, respectively.
Failure of total tumor removal was the single significant
predictive factor of tumor recurrence (P < .0001; logrank test).

AED Discontinuation
Tumor Outcome
For analysis of overall tumor control, the endpoint was
defined as the time when recurrence of a totally removed
tumor or progression of a partially resected tumor were
noticed on follow-up MRI. The actuarial tumor control
rates were 99% at the first year, 94% at the second year,
and 90% at the fifth year postoperatively (Fig. 3B).
Seizure control and tumor control were found to be highly
correlated (P ¼ .002; odds ratio, 10.1; Fisher exact test).

Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed that the actuarial
AED maintenance rates in 72 patients without seizure
recurrence were 79% at the first year, 47% at the second
year, and 11% at the fifth year. The median time to AED
discontinuation was 22 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model
revealed that a younger age at surgery was significantly
associated with a greater chance of AED discontinuation
(Table 3).

Dual Pathology
The 8 patients who received mesial resection based on the
preoperative MRI findings indicative of dual pathology
were seizure-free postoperatively, with the exception of 1
patient who developed seizure control failure after 13
months without tumor recurrence. The patient responded
to a change in AEDs and finally became Engel Class 2.

Surgical Strategy
Seizure control rates according to the location of tumors
and surgical extent are summarized in Table 4. The surgical outcomes in patients with a posteromedial temporal
lobe tumor appeared to be poor (seizure control failure in
3 of 4 patients), partly because the tumors were incompletely removed in these 3 patients.
Surgical resection was tailored to the extent of tumor
involvement in 49 patients with a tumor in the mesial
temporal lobe. The hippocampus was always removed in
5776

cases in which the tumor involved this structure, with the
exception of 1 patient with a ganglioglioma who refused
hippocampectomy for fear of memory deterioration. The
tumor recurred with malignant transformation, and the
patient died of the disease.
The hippocampus was preserved in 8 patients with a
tumor confined to the amygdala. Five patients became seizure free. Two patients underwent reoperation (mainly
for hippocampectomy) after invasive monitoring and subsequently became seizure free. A hippocampus was also
preserved in 2 patients with a small tumor involving only
the parahippocampal gyrus, and seizures were controlled
in these patients.
Dual pathology was overlooked in a patient with a
ganglioglioma confined to the left amygdala; thus, tailored tumor resection alone was performed initially. The
patient underwent reoperation (hippocampectomy) after
seizure recurrence. Hippocampal sclerosis was pathologically confirmed, and the patient became seizure free after
the reoperation (Fig. 4).

amygdala detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (B) A tailored resection (temporopolar resection plus amygdalectomy
including the tumor) was performed. Intraoperatively, the hippocampus appeared free from tumor invasion and was left
untouched. Immediate postoperative MRI revealed a slightly smaller hippocampus (arrow) in the left side without a definite signal
abnormality in T2-weighted images. Seizures recurred 21 months postoperatively, and MRI demonstrated a clearly atrophic hippocampus (arrow) with high signal intensity in (C) T2-weighted and (D) fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. Invasive monitoring revealed ictal discharges from the left hippocampus. The patient underwent hippocampectomy, and hippocampal sclerosis
was found on pathologic examination.

DISCUSSION
Seizure and Tumor Outcome
Tumor-related TLE appears to have a favorable prognosis.
Seizure control rates after surgery, including both Engel
Class 1 and 2 outcomes, have been reported to be approximately 80%4,5; however, previous studies on tumorrelated TLE provided seizure control rates at a fixed time
point. In the current study, we calculated the actuarial
rates for seizure control, because epilepsy per se as well as
brain tumors are dynamic disease entities that require a
long-term follow-up. The actuarial seizure control rates
were 86% at the second year and 79% at the fifth year
postoperatively, and there was no seizure recurrence after

the fifth year. The stable maintenance of seizure outcome
in tumor-related epilepsy patients has been reported in
another study.4 This stability is in contrast with the steady
decline in seizure control rates after surgery for MTS.9,10
Three clinical factors were found to be significantly
associated with seizure outcome in the present study.
Although some authors reported that good seizure control
can be obtained despite incomplete tumor resection,11,12
the importance of total tumor removal for seizure control
has been emphasized by many authors, especially in recent
studies.4,5,13 However, Daumas-Duport et al14 reported
that they observed no recurrence in 17 patients with an
incompletely resected DNET; in contrast, we found
2 patients with a recurring DNET who had seizure

recurrence. Moreover, a patient died of relentless recurrence and malignant transformation of low-grade ganglioglioma after intended subtotal resection for protection of
memory function. Although it has been proposed that
brain tumors presenting with chronic epilepsy are biologically indolent,4,15 to the best of our knowledge, the prognosis cannot yet be predicted on a patient basis, and total
tumor removal has an important meaning in the oncological perspective.
In the current study, a longer duration of epilepsy
was correlated with poor seizure outcomes, which is consistent with previous studies.4,5,13 Tumor-related TLE may
attain treatment resistance if it persists for a long time.
Because a remote focus on EEG was also associated with a
poor seizure outcome in this and other studies,4,16 the 2
phenomena—long duration of epilepsy and generation of
a secondary epileptogenic focus—may be interrelated.
AED Discontinuation
To our knowledge, few studies to date regarding tumorrelated epilepsy have addressed AED use in the postoperative period. In a study on tumor-related TLE, 17 of
44 seizure-free patients were completely off AEDs.5 Only
4 of 26 children with tumor-related TLE were able to quit
AEDs, although they attained a seizure-free state.17 In the
current study, the actuarial rate of AED discontinuation
at the fifth year in seizure-controlled patients was 89%.
The higher value found in this study may reflect differences in the statistical analysis. Younger patients appeared to
be more prone to AED discontinuation. Young patient
age at surgery is also known to be a favorable prognostic
factor of AED withdrawal after surgery for MTS.18
Surgical Strategy
The surgical extent necessary and sufficient for seizure
control in tumor-related epilepsy remains highly controversial.12,17,19 In tumor-related TLE, the surgical procedure may be limited to lesionectomy (tumor resection) or
be extended up to the standard temporal lobectomy. To
the best of our knowledge, little evidence is available
regarding this issue, mainly because well-matched comparisons of surgical procedures are difficult to undertake
in these heterogeneous patients. It was reported that the
prognosis of tumor-related epilepsy was determined not
5778

by the surgery type, but by the tumor pathology.4 A
detailed surgical strategy has been proposed: a lesionectomy and/or anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) for lateral temporal lobe tumors, and a lesionectomy plus ATL
and/or amygdalohippocampectomy for mesial temporal
lobe tumors. The performance of amygdalohippocampectomy was limited to a nondominant hemisphere or to
dual pathologic entities in a dominant hemisphere.16 Our
strategy was similar to this, with the difference that we
applied a more tailored lesionectomy to mesial temporal
lobe tumors. Approximately 70% of our patients who
received a tailored lesionectomy for an amygdala or a parahippocampal gyrus tumor had a good seizure outcome;
however, 2 patients required removal of the hippocampus
after tailored lesionectomy, and MTS was found in 1 of
the patients. Therefore, thorough evaluation of neuroimaging and electrophysiologic results should be undertaken before tailored lesionectomy, especially in the case
of amygdala tumors.
In the case of anterolateral temporal lobe tumors,
75% of patients in the current study received lesionectomy
and/or ATL, and 25% underwent ATL plus amygdalohippocampectomy. The outcome was slightly worse in the
latter group. The latter group may represent a more complex disease, with the presence of dual pathologic lesions.
Similar results were reported in a study on TLE patients;
only 1 patient had poor seizure outcome of 27 patients
with a lateral temporal lobe tumor who received lesionectomy (13 patients) or ATL (14 patients), whereas 2 of
7 patients who received lateral tumor resection with amygdalohippocampectomy had poor outcomes.20
Tumors in the posterior temporal lobe can be
regarded as extratemporal tumors in many aspects. In
the current study, seizure outcome was mainly affected
by the completeness of tumor removal; therefore, a
lesionectomy could be a safe and effective procedure
for these tumors.

Limitations and Advantages of This Study
Many efforts to establish clinical standards in the treatment
of tumor-related epilepsy have been discouraged by the
small number of patients, long inclusion periods, the heterogeneity of the disease, and uncontrolled study designs.
On the basis of retrospective analyses, this study had similar limitations. Although we focused on tumor-related
Cancer

December 15, 2009

TLE patients, the study population was heterogeneous in
age distribution, tumor pathology, and the extent of the
tumor. The treatment strategy was not concretely uniform
but heavily individualized. Moreover, the lack of comparative neuropsychologic analyses lessens the significance of
tailored resection with preservation of the hippocampus,
which was applied in a small group of patients. Nonetheless, this study presents substantial advantages. This is a
single-institutional study in which the patients were treated
in a relatively short period, were all examined using modern neuroimaging technologies, and were operated on by 3
surgeons. At the time of last follow-up, 60 (69%) patients
were being observed in outpatient clinics, and long-term
evaluation of the outcome was possible. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses were conducted to overcome the shortcomings of the cross-sectional approaches that have
frequently been applied to this subject.
