Abstract
Restoration of wild-type p53 tumor suppressor function has
emerged as an attractive anticancer strategy. Therapeutics targeting the two p53-negative regulators, MDM2 and MDM4, have
been developed, but most agents selectively target the ability of
only one of these molecules to interact with p53, leaving the
other free to operate. Therefore, we developed a method that
targets the activity of MDM2 and MDM4 simultaneously based
on recent studies indicating that formation of MDM2/MDM4
heterodimer complexes are required for efﬁcient inactivation of
p53 function. Using computational and mutagenesis analyses
of the heterodimer binding interface, we identiﬁed a peptide
that mimics the MDM4 C-terminus, competes with endogenous

MDM4 for MDM2 binding, and activates p53 function. This
peptide induces p53-dependent apoptosis in vitro and reduces
tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, interfering with the MDM2/
MDM4 heterodimer speciﬁcally activates a p53-dependent
oxidative stress response. Consistently, distinct subcellular
pools of MDM2/MDM4 complexes were differentially sensitive
to the peptide; nuclear MDM2/MDM4 complexes were particularly highly susceptible to the peptide-displacement activity.
Taken together, these data identify the MDM2/MDM4 interaction interface as a valuable molecular target for therapeutic
reactivation of p53 oncosuppressive function. Cancer Res; 75(21);

Introduction

interfere with the formation of the MDM2/p53 complexes (i.e.,
Nutlin; refs. 5–7). Although p53 reactivation is observed in many
wild-type TP53 cancer cells exposed to these molecules, only few
of them die by apoptosis (7, 8).
The presence of MDM4 (or MDMX; ref. 9), the MDM2 homolog, has provided a rational explanation for the relatively modest
p53-dependent apoptotic response observed in these cells (10–
12). Indeed, computational and molecular studies provided
evidence that the p53 binding domain of MDM2 and MDM4
are sufﬁciently dissimilar to explain the lack of activity of the
MDM2 inhibitors towards MDM4 (13–15).
Importantly, these data conﬁrmed previous genetic evidence
that optimal p53 reactivation can only be achieved by targeting
both MDM proteins simultaneously (16) and therefore highlighted the need of identifying molecules that target both the
p53–MDM2 and p53–MDM4 interactions. Therefore, new efforts
have been developed to ﬁnd out new molecules able to dissociate
MDM2 and MDM4 from p53 (2, 17).
Recent genetic evidence indicates that efﬁcient inhibition of
p53 requires the formation of MDM2/MDM4 heterodimers. The
heterodimers are more efﬁcient than the MDM2 homodimers in
promoting ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (18, 19).
Heterodimers also efﬁciently control basal p53 transcriptional
activity in vivo, and thus even in the absence of MDM2 E3ubiquitin ligase activity (20). In line with these data, MDM2 and
MDM4 have been found together with p53 at the promoter of
some p53 target genes to inhibit its transactivation activity (21).
To further support this model, mice that express MDM4 mutants

Discovery of new molecular targets for cancer therapy is a ﬁeld
in which considerable efforts are being employed, to develop new
and safe therapeutic agents. The p53 pathway is an attractive target
because of its well-documented oncosuppressive function (1, 2).
Since the discovery of MDM2 as crucial p53 inhibitor (3, 4), there
have been numerous attempts to pharmacologically disrupt the
interaction between these two proteins to reactivate p53 in human
wild-type TP53 tumors (2). This has led to the development of
different classes of molecules that efﬁciently and speciﬁcally

Targeting MDM2/MDM4 Interaction for p53 Reactivation

defective in MDM2 binding die during embryonic development
(22, 23). These genetic experiments support the view that the
heterodimer is required for proper control of p53 activity.
These data have raised the hypothesis that an alternative
therapeutic approach for p53 reactivation in tumors is to target
the interaction between MDM2 and MDM4 (18, 20). As the
ubiquitin ligase activity of the heterodimers depends on the Cterminal RING ﬁnger domain of MDM2, and as MDM2 homodimers are still able to function as an E3 ligase (24, 25), we
searched for molecules that bind MDM2 by simulating the MDM2
interaction interface of MDM4.

Materials and Methods
Peptides
Lyophilized Peptide3 (KEIQLVIKVFIA), Peptide3M (KEIQLVIKVAEA), Peptide SC3A (VQEAFKLIKIVI), and SC3B (AIKIFVKVLEIQ) (synthesized from Biosynthesis) were dissolved in 100%
DMSO at a concentration of 10 mmol/L. Peptides purity level was
 96%. Peptides' solution was freshly prepared at a concentration
of 0.5 mmol/L in sterile distilled deionized H2O. Peptides were
premixed with growth media at 37 C for 15 minutes before
addition to the cells. All peptides were used at 10 mmol/L concentration unless differently speciﬁed. All peptides were chemically modiﬁed by a capping acetyl group at the NH2- and an
amide group at the C-terminus.
Computational methods
Starting from the crystal structure of the heterodimer complex
(pdb code: 2VJF; ref. 19), one complex of Pep3 with MDM2 was
generated shortening the RING domain of MDM4 (chain B) from
residue E428 to K478, while keeping the RING domain of MDM2
(chain A). Pep3M was obtained editing the structure of Pep3 by
mutating residues F488 and I489 into alanine and glutamate,
respectively. The geometry of the resulting two complexes was
optimized using the Protein Preparation Wizard tool as implemented in Maestro v.9.7. (Schr€
odinger, LLC). Two molecular
systems were then prepared inserting Pep3/MDM2 and Pep3M/
MDM2 complexes into a cubic box containing TIP3P water
molecules for protein solvation, and extended 10 Å away from
any protein atom. Each of the systems was neutralized by adding
sodium and chlorine ions at a concentration of 0.15 mol/L.
Periodic boundary conditions were applied to avoid ﬁnite-size
effects. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed
using Desmond v.3.0 and the OPLS-2005 force ﬁeld. The simulation protocol included an initial energy minimization over
a maximum of 2,000 steps, with a convergence criterion of
50 kcal/mol/Å, and the presence of harmonic restraints on the
solute atoms (force constant ¼ 50.0 kcal/mol/Å2); a second
energy minimization without restraints; a third stage of 12 picoseconds (ps) at 10 K with harmonic restraints on the solute heavy
atoms (force constant ¼ 50.0 kcal/mol/Å2), using the NVT
ensemble and Berendsen thermostat; a fourth 12 ps at 10 K,
retaining the harmonic restraints, and using the NPT ensemble
and Berendsen thermostat and barostat; a ﬁfth heating phase of 24
ps at 300 K, retaining the harmonic restraints, and using the NPT
ensemble and Berendsen thermostat and barostat; a ﬁnal 24 ps at
300 K without harmonic restraints, using the NPT Berendsen
thermostat and barostat. The ﬁnal production phase of 30 nanoseconds (ns) was run using the canonical NPT Berendsen ensemble at temperature 300 K. During MD simulations, a time step of

www.aacrjournals.org

2 femtoseconds (fs) was used inserting constrains on the bond
lengths of hydrogen atoms with the M-SHAKE algorithm (26). A
total of 6252 frames of atomic coordinates were saved along the
MD trajectories. The occupancy of intermolecular hydrogen
bonds between Pep3, Pep3M, and MDM2 was calculated using
a cut-off value of 10%.
Cell cultures and treatments
Human primary ﬁbroblasts, MCF7, p53þ/þ and p53/HCT116,
HepG2, and H1299 cells were maintained in DMEM, GTL-16 in
RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). MCF7, HCT116, and
GTL-16 cell identity has been conﬁrmed by PowerPlex 18D System
(Promega) by BMR Genomics service (last analysis December
2013). Mycoplasma-free conditions have been routinely tested by
MycoAlert kit (Lonza). MCF10A cells were maintained in MEBM
supplemented with speciﬁc condiments according to the manufacturer's instructions (Lonza). p53/Mdm2/Mdm4/MEFs
(TKO-MEF) were maintained in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS (FBS-Cambrex). Transient transfections were
performed by Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Life Sciences) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. All stealth siRNAs are from
Life Technologies. MDM2 and MDM4 mutants were generated by
QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene).
Imaging
Imaging was performed through a confocal laser scanning
microscope (Leica SP5, Leica Microsystems) equipped with four
laser lines and a transmitted light detector for differential interference contrast (Nomarski) imaging. The following acquisition
settings were used: objective 63 oil immersion NA 1.4; zoom
factor 2; image format 10241024; sampled image area was x:
122 mm, y: 122 mm; pinhole 1 producing an optical section
thickness of 0.8 mm; speed acquisition 10 Hz. A random set of
single plane images of both ﬂuorescence and bright ﬁeld channels
was taken to analyze the peptide cellular distribution throughout
the coverslip. The confocal image acquisitions were performed so
that all samples were imaged using the same settings for laser
power and detector gain. Brightness and contrast of images were
globally enhanced by using linear histogram correction and
slightly oversaturated to allow a better qualitative visual evaluation of the morphologic features.
Viability and apoptosis analyses
For the Annexin V–propidium iodide staining, cells were collected, washed with PBS, and stained by Annexin V–FITC and
propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Clontech). Cells were analyzed by FACScan ﬂow cytometer and
data analyzed by CellQuest Software (Becton Dickinson). Cellcycle proﬁles were evaluated by FACS analyses of 70% ethanolﬁxed cells stained with 0.1 mg/mL propidium iodide/PBS and 2
mg/mL RNaseA solution. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation analysis
was carried out by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays with ﬂuorescent In
Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis
For immunoprecipitation cells were lysed in Saito modiﬁed
buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 0.5%

Isolation of nuclear/cytoplasmic fractions
Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as follows:
cells scraped with PBS were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer
(10 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA,
0.1 mmol/L EGTA) added with protease inhibitors (Roche). After
resuspension, NP-40 was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.6%
and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for
30 seconds at 4 C. Supernatant was collected as cytoplasmic
fraction. Nuclei pellet was resuspended in nuclear extract buffer
(20 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.4 mol/L NaCl, 0.1
mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA), rocked for 15 minutes at 4 C
and then recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes
at 4 C. The pellet containing the chromatin enriched fraction was
resuspended in nuclear extract buffer and sonicated by Heat
Systems UltraSonics Inc Sonicator W-375 Cell Disruptor at
20% of maximum output power for 30 seconds.

Clonogenicity assay
MCF7 (250 and 500 cells), and MCF10A (5,000 and 10,000
cells) were plated in complete medium in triplicate in 6, 0, and
35 mm dishes, respectively. Treatments (DMSO 0.1%, Pep3
10 mmol/L, Pep3M 10 mmol/L) were administered every 2 days.
Dishes were stained by crystal violet.

Nude mice study
CD1-Foxn1nu 6-week-old male mice were injected subcutaneously with luciferase engineered HCT116 (5  106/tumor), or
GTL-16 (2  106/tumor) in Matrigel 10 mg/mL (dilution 1:1; BD
Biosciences) to induce tumor formation. After detection of palpable tumor (tumor volume  70 mm3), mice were treated with
either Pep3 or control Pep3M injected intratumorally at a dose of
10 mg/kg and tumor growth was followed and analyzed by
luciferase activity during time. Light emission was detected using
the IVIS Lumina II CCD camera system, and the bioluminescent
signal was analyzed with the Living Image 2.20 software package
(Caliper Life Sciences). All animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with institutional guidelines, in the full observation of
the Directive 2010/63/UE. GTL-16 cells were infected with lentiviral vector pMA3160 (Addgene) to generate luciferase-expressing
cells. HCT116 were transfected with pcDNA-Luc and pBABE Puro
and selected using 1 mg/mL puromycin.

Pep3M, or Pep3 was isolated using RNA Puriﬁcation columns
(Norgen, Puriﬁcation Plus kit) following the manufacturer's
instruction. Biologic triplicates were performed. RNA quality was
assessed by Bioanalyser (RIN  9.6). After in vitro retrotranscription (Applied Biosystem), real-time PCR was performed using ABI

mRNA levels, normalized to TBP, were calculated as follows:
2[DCt(Pep3 or Pep3M)DCt(DMSO)] ¼ 2DDCt, where DCt equals Ct
(BIK, PIG3, GAPDH, p21, or MDM2)  Ct (TBP).
Whole genome expression proﬁling
The gene expression proﬁling was performed according to
the standard Agilent one-color microarray protocol (Agilent
Technologies). The cy3-labeled cRNA was hybridized to Agilent
8  60K whole human genome chip. Images were acquired
by Agilent Scanner; expression data were extracted by Feature
Extraction. Data quality ﬁltering and analysis was performed
by GeneSpring GX and Microsoft Excel. Microarray functional
data analysis was generated through the IPA webtool (27).
Clustering analysis was done using MultiExperiment Viewer.
Genes associated to speciﬁc cancer features were selected on the
basis of the annotations in the Cancer Gene Index of the NCI.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
HCT116 were untreated or treated with 10 mmol/L Pep3 or
Pep3M for 24 hours and then incubated in culture media containing 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature. After
formaldehyde neutralization, cells were washed and harvested by
ice-cold PBS. Cell lysis was performed in lysis buffer (5 mmol/L
PIPES pH 8.0, 85 mmol/L KCl, 0.5% NP-40, protease inhibitors)
and nuclei were collected and suspended in nuclei lysis buffer
(50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 1% SDS, protease
inhibitors). Nuclei were sonicated by using a Bioruptor sonicator.
Extracts were precleared with protein G (Invitrogen), and 50 mg
of DNA were used for immunoprecipitation. An aliquot of precleared lysate was taken as input control. Immunoprecipitation
was carried out with anti-p53 sheep polyclonal antibody (Ab-7
Calbiochem), conjugated to paramagnetic protein G beads (Invitrogen). Immune complexes were eluted in elution buffer
(50 mmol/L NaHCO3 and 1% SDS) by heating to 65 C for
15 minutes. DNA was puriﬁed by using QIAquick PCR

HCT116 and MCF7 cells were plated in 96-well plates and
treated with Pep3, Pep3M, or DMSO. After 48 or 72 hours, cells
were washed with PBS and incubated with 25 mmol/L 20 ,-70 dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA, Sigma) in
serum-free media at 37 C for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed
once in PBS and incubated for 3 hours in complete media
supplemented with or without 100 mmol/L H2O2. The ﬂuorescent
signal from ﬂuorescent 20 -70 -dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein (DCF)
was monitored by multimode plate reader Enspire (Perkin

Results
Characterization of the MDM2–MDM4 interaction interface
MDM2 and MDM4 form heterodimers via association of their
C-terminal RING ﬁnger domains (28) and the last residues of

www.aacrjournals.org

these domains play a crucial role in this interaction and in the
heterodimer activity (24, 25). Analyzing the structural complex of
these domains (19), three central b-sheet motifs were observed
from each RING domain that are engaged in the formation of a
tight b-barrel core at the interface. Particularly, the N-terminal
regions of MDM2/MDM4 RING ﬁnger domains interact with each
other adopting a-helix like structures, while the C-terminal
regions contribute to the formation of the b-barrel core through
hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1A). Mutagenesis experiments
have previously identiﬁed residues of MDM2 RING domain
involved in the ubiquitin ligase activity of the complex
(24, 29–31). Among these, F490, located at the C-terminus of
MDM2, forms a hydrophobic patch at the interface of the complex
with residues L433 and I489 of MDM4, and L430 and A434 of
MDM2 (Fig. 1A). As hydrophobic patches play key roles in
stabilizing protein–protein interactions (32), we investigated the
role of L433, I489, L430, and A434 as hot spots of MDM2/MDM4
interaction. MDM2 and MDM4 mutants were generated, by
mutating the above residues in either a negatively charged residue
or a polar uncharged residue (M2-L430E or M2-L430Q, and
M2-A434D or M2-A434N; M4-L433D or M4-L433N and M4I489E or M4-I489Q, respectively; Fig. 1B).

activity of all mutants but MDM2L430Q, is abolished (Supplementary Fig. S1A), indicating that these residues are important for
MDM2/MDM4 heterodimer formation as well as for MDM2
activity. In fact, all these mutants still bind p53, indicating that
loss of p53 ubiquitination is due to impairment of MDM2 activity
and that the folding of the MDM2 and MDM4 proteins is not
affected by the point mutations introduced, at least at the levels of
the p53-binding domain (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C).

of MDM2/MDM4 complex revealed that mutation of both
MDM4 residues abolishes its binding to MDM2 conﬁrming that
they are essential for the binding of the two proteins (Fig. 1C).
Conversely, the association of MDM2 mutants to MDM4 was
dependent on the replaced residue, with charged residues (L430E
and A434D) and polar uncharged residues (L430Q and A434N)
abolishing and reducing the binding to MDM4, respectively (Fig.
1D). Collectively, these observations suggest that the hydrophobic interactions promoted by the side chains of L433 and I489
from MDM4 are important for the stabilization of the RING
domain complex. Conversely, MDM2/MDM4 complexes tolerate
the replacement of L430 and A434 from MDM2 with polar
uncharged residues to some extent, though not standing the

(thereafter Pep3), a dodecapeptide that overlaps the COOHterminus of MDM4 comprising the I489 residue (KEIQLVIKVFI489A), was able to reduce p53 ubiquitination in different cell
lines as compared with untreated or solvent (0,1% DMSO) treated
cells (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S1E). In comparison, a
control peptide in which the I489 and the F488 aminoacids were
substituted by E489 and A488, respectively (Pep3M, KEIQLVIKVAEA) did not affect levels of ubiquitinated p53 (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E). A peptide containing only
substitution of I489 retained partial inhibitory activity towards
MDM2 (Supplementary Fig. S1E).
Starting from the structural data of MDM2/MDM4 RING
domains, MD simulations of Pep3 and Pep3M in complex with
the MDM2-RING domain were used to investigate the molecular
basis of their binding modes to MDM2. Pep3 is stably anchored
to MDM2, with the backbone oxygen and nitrogen atoms engaged
in a pattern of stable hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms
of MDM2 (Table 1). The side chain of MDM4-I489 stably occupies a hydrophobic pocket deﬁned by residue L458 of MDM2
(Pocket 1, Fig. 2B) along the entire MD trajectory. MDM4-F488
undergoes a conformational change docking its side chain into a
second hydrophobic pocket (Pocket 2, Fig. 2B) deﬁned by residue
V477 of MDM2. Although Pep3M makes six stable backbonemediated hydrogen bonds with MDM2 (Table 1), it does not
occupy the two hydrophobic pockets (Fig. 2C). Speciﬁcally, the
side chain of A488 is too short to reach Pocket 2, and the polar
side chain of E489 is not suited to occupy the hydrophobic
Pocket 1. These data provide a likely explanation as for why Pep3,
but not Pep3M, binds to MDM2, with the former peptide matching two hydrophobic patches (Pocket 1 and 2) at the interface
of the complex. These data highlight also the role of MDM4F488 in the interaction of MDM4/Pep3 to MDM2 and explain
the partial activity of the peptide-3 mutated in the I489 only.
In vitro binding assays conﬁrmed Pep3/MDM2 interaction. Pep3
conjugated to the ﬂuorescein-isothiocyanate group (FITC-Pep3)
was indeed able to coimmunoprecipitate MDM2, whereas
increasing doses of FITC-Pep3M did not (Fig. 2D).
Pep3 induces p53-dependent cancer cell death
We next tested the cell-penetrating activity of FITC-Pep3 in vivo.
Strikingly, internalization of the peptide in a time and dosedependent manner was observed upon its addition to the culture
medium of the human cancer cell line MCF7 (Fig. 3A and B).
Confocal imaging showed an intense FITC-Pep3 staining conﬁned to vesicular structures frequently surrounding the nucleus.
In addition, several FITC-Pep3–positive vesicles were observed in
proximity to the plasma membrane indicative of an active internalization process of FITC-Pep3. Similar results were obtained for
Pep3M (Supplementary Fig. S2A). FACS analysis allowed us to
quantify the high proportion of FITC-positive cells (Fig. 3B and

Supplementary Fig. S2B). Similar results were obtained with the
colorectal cancer cell line HCT116. Interestingly, the FITC-Pep3–
positive HCT116 cells showed a signiﬁcant increase of apoptotic
cell death compared with FITC-Pep3M–treated cells (Fig. 3C and
Supplementary Fig. S2C). In contrast, Pep3 and Pep3M peptides
caused only a limited increase of cell death in HCT116 cells
lacking functional p53 (p53/HCT116), indicating that
Pep3-induced apoptosis is dependent on the presence of p53
(Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained when using untagged
peptides (Supplementary Fig. S2D). In contrast, scramble peptides (SC3A and SC3B) containing the same aminoacids present in Pep3 but assembled in a different order did not induce
cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2E), conﬁrming the speciﬁcity
of Pep3 activity.
Treatment of HCT116 cells with increasing doses of Pep3 (2, 5,
10, 20, 30 mmol/L) showed dose-dependent cell death reaching a
plateau at 20 mmol/L (Fig. 3D). Pep3 also induced apoptosis in
wt-p53 GTL-16, MCF7 (Fig. 3E), and HEPG2 (Supplementary Fig.
S2F) cell lines. Conversely, it was ineffective in p53-null H1299
(Supplementary Fig. S2G) or in p53-knockdown MCF7 cells
(shp53-MCF7) (Fig. 3F). Importantly, Pep3 did not signiﬁcantly
increase cell death in MDM2-knockdown GTL-16 cells (siMDM2GTL-16), indicating that its activity requires the presence of
MDM2 (Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. S2H). Pep3 also significantly inhibited colony formation in MCF7 cells in comparison
with control cells, suggesting its ability to affect the tumorigenic
potential of cancer cells in vitro (Fig. 3H). Importantly, Pep3 did
not increase apoptotic cell death nor affected cell-cycle proﬁle or
colony forming ability in untransformed MCF10A cells (Fig. 3I
and J and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Similarly, it did not increase
cell death (by FACS and PARP-1 cleavage analysis) nor affected
cell-cycle proﬁle in primary human ﬁbroblasts (Supplementary
Fig. S3B–S3D), suggesting that this peptide selectively affects the
viability of tumor cells but not of untransformed ones.
Pep3 impairs tumor growth in vivo
To assess the therapeutic potential of Pep3 in vivo, we tested the
antitumor effects of Pep3 in xenograft models. CD1-Foxn1nu mice
were injected in both ﬂanks with HCT116, or GTL-16 cells
expressing a stable luciferase reporter gene. Once luciferase-positive tumor masses were clearly detected (corresponding to tumor
volume  70 mm3), the mice were randomly divided into two
groups and Pep3 or Pep3M injected (10 mg/kg) every other day in
one of the two ﬂanks for at least 15 days. Tumor growth was
monitored by measuring bioluminescence and quantiﬁed as
percentage of the bioluminescence of the treated versus untreated
contralateral tumor. Whereas Pep3 signiﬁcantly reduced tumor
growth, Pep3M had only a marginal effect (Fig. 3K and L and
Supplementary Fig. S4A). The p53 protein showed comparable
levels in all samples, suggesting that the gene remained wild-type

during the course of the experiment (see Fig. 4C). No signiﬁcant
host toxicity was observed as evaluated by animal weight (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Accordingly, FITC-Pep3 injection in the
hind limb muscle of mice showed no diffusion of the ﬂuorescence
signal within 24 hours (Supplementay Fig. S4C). Taken together,
these data demonstrate that Pep3 effectively suppresses tumor
growth in vivo, and conﬁrm that the MDM4/MDM2 interaction
interface is a potential molecular target for anticancer therapy.
Pep-3 increases levels of p53 bound to chromatin
To understand Pep3 activity, we analyzed the effects of Pep3
treatment at the molecular level. Pep3 exposure caused a marked

4566 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

decrease of full-length PARP-1 (ﬂ-PARP-1), a marker of cell
apoptosis, in both MCF7 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 4A and B).
Caspase-3 cleavage was not detected, suggesting the involvement
of caspase-7 in PARP-1 cleavage (33). Importantly, ﬂ-PARP-1 was
signiﬁcantly decreased also in Pep3-treated but not in Pep3Mtreated xenograft tumor samples (Fig. 4C and D), indicating that
Pep3-induced suppression of tumor growth is likely caused by in
vivo cell apoptosis. Unexpectedly, Pep3-induced apoptosis did not
correlate with an increase in p53 steady-state protein levels
(Fig. 4A–C). However, analysis of p53 subcellular distribution
revealed a signiﬁcant Pep3-mediated increase in the pool of p53
bound to chromatin at the detriment of its soluble/nucleoplasmic

fraction (Fig. 4E). The MDM4 protein was redistributed similarly
to p53, whereas MDM2 subcellular distribution was not affected
by Pep3 (Fig. 4E). These data are consistent with an alteration of
the MDM2/MDM4 nuclear complexes upon Pep3 addition. In
fact, association between MDM4 and MDM2 was reduced by Pep3
in the nuclear fraction but not in cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 4F and
Supplementary Fig. S5A). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not exacerbate the Pep3-dependent increase in
p53 protein levels, including the chromatin bound fraction
(Fig. 4G), conﬁrming that Pep3 interferes with p53 degradation.
The levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX (g-H2AX), a marker of DNA damage did not increase upon Pep3 exposure (Fig. 4E),
indicating that recruitment of p53 to the chromatin is not associated with activation of the DNA damage response. Accordingly,
phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46 or Ser15, two features of stressmediated p53 activation were not observed (Supplementary Fig.
S5B and S5C).
Pep3 induces p53-dependent transcriptional activation of
proapoptotic/oxidant targets
Transcriptionally active p53 can induce apoptosis through
different target genes (34). Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis
of Pep3-treated HCT116 cells compared with untreated, DMSO or
Pep3M-treated cells, identiﬁed 347 and 198 genes that were
signiﬁcantly deregulated 24 and 48 hours after treatment respectively (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Overlapping of the two
groups of genes deregulated at 24 and 48 hours revealed a
signiﬁcant alteration of a common subgroup of 49 genes (Fig.
5A and Supplementary Fig. S6). Clusters corresponding to the
different treatments were clearly apparent on a principal component analysis (PCA; Fig. 5B).
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis revealed that most of the 347
mRNAs deregulated by Pep3 encode for proteins involved in cell
death and survival (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S6E). Of note,
p53 was identiﬁed as one of the top putative upstream regulators
of these genes conﬁrming that Pep3 induces p53 activity (Fig. 5D).
Among the well-established p53 target genes induced by Pep3
are two genes encoding for proapoptotic and pro-oxidant factors:
BCL2 interacting killer, BIK/BP4/NBK/BIP1 (35), and tumor protein p53-inducible protein-3, PIG3/TP53I3 (Fig. 5D; ref. 36). qRTPCR conﬁrmed the signiﬁcant induction of these mRNAs at 24
(Fig. 5E) and 48 hours (Supplementary Fig. S6F), whereas, in
comparison, p21/WAF1 and MDM2, two p53 target genes,
involved mainly in growth arrest, were not induced by Pep3.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) conﬁrmed the increased
recruitment of p53 at the promoter of PIG3 in cells exposed to
Pep3 (Fig. 5F). In contrast, no increased recruitment of p53 at the
MDM2 promoter in the same experimental conditions was
observed (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Consistent with these ﬁndings, BIK protein levels were highly increased upon Pep3 exposure
both in MCF7 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 6A and B and Supplementary Fig. S7B). Of importance, siBIK by single oligos or their mix
(Supplementary Fig. S8A) resulted in decreased PARP-1 cleavage
(Fig. 6B) and Pep3-induced cell apoptosis (Supplementary Fig.
S9A), conﬁrming the role played by this gene in Pep3-mediated
activity. Given the involvement of BIK and PIG3 in p53-mediated
oxidative stress response (36, 37), we quantiﬁed reactive oxygen
species (ROS) levels using the ﬂuorogenic probe DCF upon H2O2
stimulation. This analysis revealed a signiﬁcant increase of intracellular ROS levels following Pep3 exposure both in HCT116 and
MCF7 cells (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S9B), conﬁrming that

4568 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

Pep3 counteracts the antioxidant potential of the cell. The Pep3dependent increase of ROS levels in HCT116 cells was detectable
even in the absence of H2O2 stimulation (Fig. 6C). Importantly,
ROS levels were not induced by Pep3 in p53/HCT116 cells (Fig.
6C), conﬁrming the crucial role played by p53 in this Pep3induced response. Finally, siBIK or siPIG3 (Supplementary Fig.
S8) rescued the increase of ROS levels mediated by Pep3 treatment
(Fig. 6D), conﬁrming the role played by these genes in this
response.

Discussion
Most of the pharmacologic approaches aiming at reactivating
p53 in cancer cells have focused to date on the interaction
interface between p53 and MDM2 or MDM4. Here, we developed
an alternative strategy that aims at inhibiting the activity of the
MDM2/MDM4 complexes by interfering with their heterodimerization. Our study demonstrates that the binding of a
peptide mimicking the MDM4 C-terminus tail to MDM2, impairs
MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and activates p53-dependent transcription and oncosuppressive activities.
Interestingly, our data indicate that Pep3 may be mainly
effective towards a speciﬁc subcellular pool of MDM2/MDM4/
p53 as evidenced by the alteration of the nuclear complexes but
not of the cytoplasmic fraction. Consistently, the p53 transcriptional program activated by Pep3 is restricted to some p53 target
genes involved in the oxidative stress response, suggesting a
speciﬁc control of this function by the MDM2/MDM4 complexes.
In fact, MDM2 and MDM4 act as cotranscriptional inhibitors at
the p53-responsive elements on the promoter of PIG3, but not of
MDM2 or RCHY1/PIRH2 genes (21). In addition, MDM2 mediates histone ubiquitylation and transcriptional repression (38).
At present, it is not known whether subcellular MDM2/MDM4
complexes present different features. The conformation assumed
by the complexes consequent to DNA binding might contribute to
the selective sensitivity of the nuclear heterodimers to Pep3.
Alternatively, additional partners and/or post-translational modiﬁcations may distinguish the subcellular complexes.
In contrast to the majority of the approaches that target the
interaction between p53 and MDM2, our method causes p53dependent cell death of various cancer cells, supporting the
requirement of the heterodimer for efﬁcient control of p53
function. The observation that the preferred response elicited by
Pep3 is apoptosis is also in agreement with recent data from our
and other labs that reported impairment of MDM4/MDM2 heterodimer function during apoptosis (22, 39–41). Importantly,
this observation highlights the potential therapeutic value of
targeting the MDM2/MDM4 heterodimers.
Cancer cells are subjected to increased and persistent oxidative
stress and accumulating evidence indicates that increasing ROS
levels represents an effective approach to induce cancer cell–
speciﬁc apoptosis (42–44). Accordingly, the p53-reactivating
molecule RITA appears to function by ROS-activating mechanism
as Pep3 (45). Our data, indicating that Pep3 reduces the antioxidative potential of the cell and enhances ROS levels, further
support the targeting of MDM2/MDM4 complexes as a cancer
cell–speciﬁc efﬁcient therapeutic strategy. The absence of Pep3
activity in untransformed cell line MCF10A and in human ﬁbroblasts is consistent with this hypothesis.
Compared with the current p53-reactivating approaches, the
ability of Pep3 to activate the chromatin-enriched fraction of p53

Targeting MDM2/MDM4 Interaction for p53 Reactivation

might endow this strategy of reduced toxicity. In fact, in a recent
exploratory clinical trial, the p53-activating molecule RG7112, a
member of Nutlin family, has shown treatment-related serious
adverse events (46), all of which related to haematologic toxicity
(47) caused probably by the treatment-derived high levels of p53.
Similarly, highly levels of p53 have been observed following the
treatment with the unique double MDM2/MDM4 inhibitor
developed so far (17).
In addition, given the increased speciﬁcity of anticancer peptides in the recognition of their targets (48), Pep3 may overcome
side effects and toxicities of other cancer therapies. In fact, smallmolecule inhibitors of MDM2-mediated ubiquitinating activity,
have shown unintended activities towards other RING ﬁnger E3
ligases (49, 50).
On the basis of these data, targeting the MDM2/MDM4 interaction interface appears a promising therapeutic strategy for
developing new anticancer lead compounds with high speciﬁcity
and effectiveness.
