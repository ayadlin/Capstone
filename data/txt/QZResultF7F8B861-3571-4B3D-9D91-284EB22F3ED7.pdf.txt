BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have suggested that resection of the primary tumor improves survival in patients
with stage IV breast cancer, yet in the era of targeted therapy, the relation between surgery and tumor molecular
subtype is unknown. The objective of the current study was to identify subsets of patients who may benefit from primary tumor treatment and assess the frequency of local disease progression. METHODS: Patients presenting with
stage IV breast cancer and intact primary tumors (n ¼ 186) were identified from a prospectively maintained clinical
database (2000-2004) and clinical data were abstracted (grading determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system). RESULTS: Surgery was performed in 69 (37%) patients: 34 (49%) patients with
unknown metastatic disease at the time of surgery, 15 (22%) patients for local control, 14 (20%) patients for palliation,
and in 6 (9%) patients to obtain tissue. Surgical patients were more likely to be HER-2/neu negative (P ¼ .001), and
to have smaller tumors (P ¼ .05) and solitary metastasis (P <.001). Local therapy included axillary lymph node clearance in 33 (48%) patients and postoperative radiotherapy in 9 (13%) patients. The median survival was 35 months.
Cox regression analysis identified estrogen receptor (ER) positivity (hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.29-0.76), progesterone receptor (PR) positivity (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.90), and HER-2/neu amplification (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.77) as being predictive of improved survival. There was a trend toward improved survival with surgery (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.06). On exploratory analyses, surgery was found to be associated with
improved survival in patients with ER/PR positive or HER-2/neu-amplified disease (P ¼ .004). No survival benefit was
observed in patients with triple-negative disease. CONCLUSIONS: Although a trend toward improved survival with
surgery was observed, it was noted most strongly in patients with ER/PR positive and/or HER-2/neu-amplified disease. This suggests that the impact of local control is greatest in the presence of effective targeted therapy, and supC 2010

The prognosis of patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer has improved over the last decade.1 Recent data suggest

that patients are being diagnosed with a lower burden of disease because of improved diagnostic modalities.1 Along with
these trends, systemic treatment options have proliferated rapidly and now include several molecularly targeted therapies.
As a result, the survival of patients with stage IV breast cancer has improved to a median of 29 months.1 For many patients,
the treatment paradigm for stage IV disease is changing and can be viewed as chronic, maintenance therapy.
Traditionally, local treatment of stage IV breast cancer, either through surgery or radiotherapy, has been reserved
for palliation of advanced local disease.2 However, recent reviews of population and institutional databases suggest that
a significant percentage of women (approximately 40-60%) are receiving surgical treatment of their primary tumor as a
component of therapy for stage IV disease,3-6 a rate that is considerably higher than what would be expected for palliative purposes alone. Although the clinical rationale for the inclusion of surgery in the treatment of many of these
patients with stage IV disease is unclear, these retrospective studies have suggested that surgical resection of the primary

tumor is associated with a survival benefit.3-5,7-11 However, in the absence of prospective data, the subset of
patients presenting with stage IV disease who are most
likely to benefit from surgical resection of the primary
tumor is unknown.
Although the population database studies addressing
the role of surgery in the management of patients with
stage IV breast cancer incorporate large cohorts of patients
and provide the most generalizable conclusions, they are
inherently limited by the clinical variables recorded.12
This is especially significant when it applies to hormone
receptor or HER-2/neu status. In addition, clinical details
such as indications for the procedure, the specific procedure performed, surgical margin status, and local radiotherapy are unable to be considered. In contrast, singleinstitution studies may be limited by institutional biases
and smaller numbers of evaluable patients. Therefore, any
conclusions reached from these series should be considered exploratory. However, the strengths of these singleinstitution datasets are the degree of clinical detail available. Institution-based studies have the potential to contribute significantly to the literature regarding surgical
resection in patients with stage IV breast cancer by identifying those subsets of patients with the greatest potential
to benefit from surgical resection—information critical to
the design of the prospective clinical trial needed to definitively address this question. In addition, single-institution
studies are needed to clarify the magnitude of the problem
of uncontrolled local disease in this patient population in
the modern era of systemic therapy. Therefore, we sought,
in a single-institution study, to explore the role of local
control of the breast primary tumor in patients presenting
with stage IV disease in the era of molecularly targeted
therapy. The objective of the current study was to identify
subsets of patients who may benefit from primary tumor
treatment and assess the frequency of local disease
progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This project was approved by the Institutional Review
Board. Two institutional databases were screened to identify all patients evaluated at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center who presented with an intact primary tumor and stage IV disease from January 1, 2000 through
December 31, 2004. The cohort was limited to this time
period to ensure homogeneity in available treatment
options, specifically molecularly targeted systemic therapy. Patients were classified as having stage IV disease

based on the sixth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual13; patients with supraclavicular disease only were excluded. Patients
undergoing surgery for the primary tumor >30 months
from the time of the initial diagnosis of breast cancer also
were excluded.
Demographic, tumor, treatment, and survival data
were retrospectively abstracted from the chart. Breast tumor size; histology; and estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER-2/neu status were recorded.
ER and PR status was available for all patients; in 2
patients, the HER-2/neu status was unknown. Site(s) of
metastases at the time of initial presentation were classified as soft tissue, bone, visceral disease, or a combination
of disease sites. The number of metastases at the time of
diagnosis was categorized into 1 or >1 site. Indications
for surgical resection were classified into 1 of 4 categories:
palliation of symptoms, local control in the setting of
good systemic response or minimal metastatic disease, to
obtain tissue (for additional receptor status testing, protocols, etc), or the presence of metastatic disease unknown
at time of surgery. Surgical procedure performed, margin
status, and the use of local radiotherapy were recorded.
Local disease recurrence after surgical resection (chest wall
or axillary) was also abstracted; only those patients undergoing axillary lymph node clearance were evaluated for axillary disease recurrence. It was not possible from
retrospective chart review to accurately determine why
patients were not selected for surgery. In addition, local
control of the chest wall or axilla for patients not selected
for surgical resection was not able to be evaluated accurately in a retrospective manner.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
statistical software (version 9.2; StataCorp, College Station, Tex). Baseline characteristics of patients selected or
not selected for surgery were compared using the Student
t test or chi-square test when appropriate. Survival time
was defined from the time of the diagnosis of breast cancer
until the time of death or last follow-up. Unadjusted survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and differences in survival were evaluated with a
log-rank statistic. Multivariate assessment of prognostic
factors associated with survival was performed using Cox
regression analysis. Factors evaluated in the model
included surgical resection, ER/PR status, HER-2/neu
amplification, age at the time of the diagnosis of breast
cancer, the presence of solitary metastasis, and site(s) of
initial metastatic disease. Age was regarded as a continuous variable.

RESULTS
A total of 186 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were
identified from the institutional databases. Overall demographics are presented in Table 1. The median age at the
time of diagnosis was 56 years. The majority of women
(64%) had T1 or T2 breast tumors. At the time of diagnosis, 31% had visceral-only disease, 37% had bone-only
disease, and 29% had both; 3% of patients had soft tissue
disease alone. Most patients received a variety of systemic
treatments, including chemotherapy in 88%, hormonal
therapy in 65%, and trastuzumab in 29% of patients.
Overall, 89% of patients with hormone receptor-positive
(113 of 127 patients) and 90% of patients with HER-2/
neu-amplified (53 of 59 patients) disease received hormonal therapy and trastuzumab, respectively.
Surgery was performed in 69 (37%) patients. When
the clinical features of patients selected for surgery were
evaluated (Table 1), surgical patients were more likely to
be negative for HER-2/neu (P ¼ .001), have smaller
tumors (P ¼ .05), and have a solitary metastasis (P
<.0005). In 34 patients (49%), surgery was performed
before the extent of disease workup that demonstrated
metastatic disease (Table 2). Other reasons included palliation in 14 (20%) patients, local control in 15 (22%)
patients, and to obtain tissue in 6 (9%) patients. The median time to surgery in this cohort of patients was 8
months (range, 0-25 months) after diagnosis. Among
patients selected for surgery, 29 (42%) had bone-only disease at the time of diagnosis, 10 of whom had a solitary
bony metastasis. Seven of the 22 patients with visceralonly disease and 3 of the 4 patients with soft tissue-only
disease had a solitary metastasis.

months). At a median of 8.5 months (range, 4-27
months) from surgery, 12% (8 of 69) of patients experienced a clinical disease recurrence in the chest wall (n ¼ 5
patients) or breast (n ¼ 3 patients), and 9% (3 of 33) of
patients undergoing axillary lymph node clearance developed a clinical disease recurrence in the axilla. No clinical
factors (tumor size, surgical margin status, use of postoperative radiotherapy, reason for surgery) were found to be
associated with disease recurrence. A trend toward
increased locoregional disease recurrence was observed in
patients who were ER/PR negative and HER-2/neu negative. However, the number of patients in each subset was
too small to draw any definitive conclusions.
The overall median survival for the entire cohort
was 35 months, with a 1-year survival rate of 88% and a
5-year survival rate of 30%. A total of 128 deaths were
observed in the cohort during the follow-up period, and
the median follow-up of survivors was 53 months (range,
6-88 months). On univariate analysis, patients selected
for surgical resection were found to have improved survival compared with those patients undergoing systemic

therapy alone; the median survival times were 40 months
and 33 months, respectively. No survival difference was
observed in patients who underwent surgical resection
based on margin status or the timing of the resection (data
not shown). On Cox regression, ER status, PR status,
HER-2/neu amplification, and site of metastatic disease
predicted survival (Table 3).
Several exploratory analyses were performed to
attempt to identify a subset of patients with stage IV disease and an intact primary tumor who may most benefit
from the incorporation of surgery as a component of multidisciplinary treatment. In our cohort, tumor molecular
subtype was found to be the most significant prognostic
factor (Table 3). When considering surgery in the context
of tumor molecular subtype, surgery was associated with
improved survival in patients with either hormone receptor-positive disease or HER-2/neu amplification; surgery
was not found to be associated with improved survival in
patients with triple-negative disease (Fig. 1). This correlation was maintained on multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, site of metastasis, and number of metastases
(Table 4).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we observed a trend toward improved survival in patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer
who underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor.
This observation is in keeping with the remarkably consistent findings of other retrospective studies evaluating
the role of surgery in the treatment of patients with stage
IV disease (Table 5),3-11 and similar outcomes also have
been observed in patients receiving radiotherapy for local
control in the breast.14 As in prior studies, patients
selected for surgery in our cohort represented a somewhat

cancer and an intact primary tumor, with and without triplenegative disease, is shown by surgical status.

better prognostic group: they tended to have smaller primary tumors and less metastatic disease, and were less
likely to have HER-2/neu amplification. However, we
found that the survival benefit of surgery was present not
only in the group of patients with the more favorable hormone receptor-positive status, but also in patients with
HER-2/neu-amplified disease when targeted systemic
therapy was used.
Although a trend toward improved survival after
surgical resection of the primary tumor was observed in
our overall study cohort, on exploratory analyses this
effect was limited to patients with ER/PR positive or
HER-2/neu-amplified cancers; patients with triple-negative disease did not experience any differential improvement in survival. To the best of our knowledge, the
current study is the first to recognize that the molecular
subtype of the primary tumor influences the outcomes of
patients with stage IV disease who undergo surgical resection of the primary tumor. However, other recent studies
have suggested that the molecular subtype of the primary
tumor has a significant influence on outcome after local
treatment, including the likelihood of local disease recurrence after breast conservation or mastectomy, and even
overall survival.15-18 In a study by Kyndi et al, the molecular subtypes of the tumors in a subset of patients randomized as part of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative
Group trials evaluating postmastectomy radiotherapy
were reviewed.16 Overall survival in this trial was found to

be improved with postmastectomy radiotherapy; however, on subset analyses, this effect was found to be limited
to patients who were ER/PR positive and HER-2/neu
negative who received tamoxifen. The impact of radiotherapy on locoregional control also was found to be
greatest in these subgroups. Similarly, Nguyen et al
reported that the molecular subtype impacted the likelihood of local and distant disease recurrence after breastconserving therapy.17 Patients with ER/PR negative
tumors, regardless of HER-2/neu amplification status,
were found to have the highest likelihood of disease recurrence, whereas patients with ER/PR positive tumors who
received tamoxifen had a 5-year risk of local disease recurrence of <2%.
Although these studies support the current study
findings that locoregional therapy has a positive impact
on outcome in patients with ER/PR positive disease, they
differ with respect to the influence of HER-2/neu status.
This is likely attributable to differences in the patient
cohorts. We limited the current study cohort to a relatively modern time period during which homogenous
treatment options were available. As a result, nearly 90%
of the patients in our cohort who were eligible for hormonal therapy or trastuzumab received the targeted therapy.
In contrast, although the majority of patients in both the
studies by Kyndi et al16 and Nguyen et al17 received hormonal therapy, none received trastuzumab. Therefore, we
believe the current study represents a unique cohort in
which to observe the impact of a local therapy in women
optimally treated with targeted systemic therapy. In addition, it has been postulated by others that the likelihood
of local therapy improving survival in patients with stage I

Cancer

March 1, 2010

to stage III breast cancer is correlated with the effectiveness of adjuvant systemic therapy.19 The results of the current study support this concept for patients with stage IV
disease by demonstrating a survival benefit for both a traditionally good-risk group (patients with tumors that are
ER/PR positive) and a high-risk group (patients with
HER-2/neu-amplified disease) in the setting of effective
targeted therapy.
Survival is an important outcome when considering
treatment modalities in the setting of metastatic disease.
However, when contemplating the role of surgical resection of the breast primary tumor in patients with stage IV
disease, factors beyond survival must be considered. Retrospective analyses suggest that most patients in the modern era do not undergo surgery for palliation of
symptoms.2,7,10,11,20 The possibility that uncontrolled
local disease in the breast will become a concern increases
as survival time increases, and a desire by clinicians to
avoid ‘‘toilet’’ mastectomy, may be behind the high rates
of breast surgery observed in the patient population with
de novo stage IV disease. However, to the best of our
knowledge, few studies to date have evaluated the effectiveness of surgical local control in this setting. Current
data are limited to 2 relatively small retrospective series
(20 patients and 47 patients, respectively) in which chest
wall local control was maintained after surgical resection
of the primary tumor in 82% to 85% of patients (followup of a mean of 20 months21 and a median of 26.9
months11). In what to our knowledge is the largest series,
surgical resection was found to be protective against the
development of symptomatic chest wall disease when
compared with a cohort not selected for surgical resection

(64 patients).11 Although 66% of the patients undergoing
surgery in this study also underwent axillary lymph node
dissection, no comment was made regarding local control
of axillary disease.
Data from the current study confirm that surgery
can provide durable control of in-breast disease, even
when a limited surgical approach is used. Although
approximately 42% of patients had positive surgical margins, and radiotherapy was used infrequently, only 12%
of patients developed disease recurrence in the chest wall
or breast. The axillary lymph node recurrence rate of 9%
is somewhat higher than that reported after axillary lymph
node dissection in the nonmetastatic setting, but represents a small group of patients and may be a reflection of
the failure to use radiotherapy in patients with a heavy disease burden. The molecular subtype of the tumor did not
appear to impact the likelihood of durable local control
after surgical resection; however, the number of patients
included in this exploratory analysis was very small. It was
not possible from our retrospective chart review to determine how many patients who were not selected for surgery may have benefited from preemptive local treatment
for symptom control. However, the true benefit of surgery
with regard to local control in the breast or the axilla can
only be answered within the setting of a prospective trial.
The current study is limited by its retrospective
design and cannot provide definitive causation between
surgical resection of the primary tumor and the improved
survival observed; for this reason, it should be considered
an exploratory study intended to identify subsets of
patients in whom a stronger association between surgery
and survival is present. We were unable to evaluate some
clinically relevant data points, such as why some patients
were not selected for surgery and the incidence of locoregional disease progression in those patients. In addition,
our study population was derived from a single tertiary
care hospital, and the results may be less generalizable
than those from larger population-based studies. In particular, a high percentage of these patients had asymptomatic metastatic disease detected on postoperative staging
workup, and their clinical course may not reflect that of
patients with overt metastatic disease and a higher tumor
burden. However, the strength of the current study lies in
the relative homogeneity of the study cohort and the completeness of data regarding prognostic factors. In contrast
to population database studies,12 ER/PR status was available for all patients, HER-2/neu status was available for
99% of patients, and we used a single definition of stage
IV disease (the sixth edition of the AJCC staging man-

1232

ual).6,13 By limiting the time period of the study, we were
able to ensure homogeneity in available treatment
options1 and confirm the receipt of molecularly targeted
therapies when appropriate. Because of the detailed clinical data available, we were able to perform exploratory
analyses to identify those patients who may benefit the
most from surgical intervention to the primary tumor.

Conclusions
The results of the current study contribute to the growing
body of literature addressing the question of whether surgical resection of the primary tumor in patients presenting
de novo with stage IV disease improves survival. It represents the outcomes of a modern cohort of patients treated
entirely in the era of molecularly targeted therapy.
Although a trend toward improved survival with surgery
was observed in the overall study population, this was
most strongly noted in the subset of patients with ER/PR
positive and/or HER-2/neu-amplified disease, suggesting
that the impact of local control is most evident in the presence of effective targeted therapy. It is interesting to note
that patients with HER-2/neu-amplified disease, who are
in the subset of patients most likely to benefit from local
therapy, are also the patients least likely to be selected for
this treatment modality.
It is conceivable that the observations of the current
study and others may be attributable to selection bias that
is not controlled for in the analyses; the true impact on
survival can only be definitely answered in a prospective
fashion. However, a biological rationale for the improved
survival observed with surgical resection of the primary tumor in patients with stage IV disease does exist. New concepts of the metastatic dissemination of tumors support
the possibility that resection of the primary tumor may
impact survival. Under the ‘‘self-seeding’’ theory, tumor
cells have the propensity to escape from the primary tumor and seed distant sites, but also may metastasize back
to the site of the primary tumor22; resection of the primary tumor in this scenario would have clinical relevance.
Thus, clinical observations, viewed in parallel with new
theories of cancer biology, mandate that further exploration into the role of surgery for local control, as well as the
potential survival implications, be performed. The strong
preferences for management of the breast among women
diagnosed with breast cancer also dictate that quality of
life be a part of any future study evaluating the role of surgical resection of the primary tumor in patients with stage
IV breast cancer.

Primary Breast Surgery in Stage IV CA/Neuman et al

As in any multidisciplinary treatment plan, some
patients will benefit more from therapy than others, and
treatments should be tailored toward those patients who
will derive the most benefit. The same should hold true for
surgical resection of the primary tumor in patients with
stage IV breast cancer. The current study was intended as
an exploration to identify those patients who may benefit
most from surgical resection of the primary tumor in the
modern era of targeted systemic therapy. The prognostic
factors identified should be considered in the patient stratification phase of any future prospective study.
