Abstract
Purpose: We conducted this phase I/II clinical trial to determine the safety and
efficacy of lower-dose decitabine based therapy in pretreated patients with advanced
HCC.
Experimental Design: Patients with advanced HCC were eligible. The administered
dose of decitabine was 6 mg/m2/d intravenously on days 1 to 5 of a 28-day cycle.
Additional therapies were given based on their disease progression status. The
endpoint was to ensure the safety, hepatotoxicity, clinical responses, progressionfree survival (PFS) and pharmacodynamics assay of lower-dose decitabine.
Results: Fifteen patients were enrolled. The favorable adverse events and
liver function profiles were observed. The most beneficial responses were 1
complete response (CR), 6 stable disease (SD) and 8 progressive disease (PD).
MRI liver scans post-treatment indicated a unique and specific characteristic.
The immunohistochemistry result from the liver biopsy exhibited noteworthy CTL
responses. Median PFS was 4 months (95% CI 1.7, 7), comparing favorably with
existing therapeutic options. Expression decrement of DNMT1 and global DNA
hypomethylation were observed in PBMCs after lower-dose decitabine treatment.
Conclusion: The lower-dose decitabine based treatment resulted in beneficial
clinical response and favorable toxicity profiles in patients with advanced HCC. The
prospective evaluations of decitabine administration schemes and tumor tissue-based
pharmacodynamics effect are warranted in future trials.

Introduction

of decitabine for treating solid tumors have proven to be
substantially toxic to cancer patients [3, 4]. A clinical trial,
conducted in MDS using 0.1-0.2 mg/kg (3.5-7 mg/m2)
decitabine, revealed the decreased toxicity and complete
hematologic and cytogenetic remission, with an overall
response rate of 44% [5], suggesting the usage of a very
low dosage of decitabine could be a potential compelling
and effective form of therapy for solid cancer [3, 6-8].

Decitabine (5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine) is an
epigenetic drug that inhibits DNA methylation [1] and
has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute
myelogenous leukemia [2]. The maximally tolerated doses

Based on this hypothesis, we registered a phase I/II
clinical trial for lower-dose decitabine therapy, named the
“Lower Dose Decitabine Based Therapy in Patients with
Refractory and/or Chemotherapy Resistant Solid Tumors
or B Cell Lymphomas” (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01799083).
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most common lethal malignancies [9, 10]. The prognosis
of HCC is dismal, mainly because diagnosis typically
occurs in the advanced stage and there is a lack of feasible
treatment modalities [10]. In particular, HCC was selected
because of its clinical uniqueness and significance in
China. The majority of the Chinese HCCs are associated
with viral hepatitis. Importantly, prior trials involving high
doses of decitabine did not draw a definite conclusion
about the clinical response of HCC and posed a problem to
subjects with ultra-hepatotoxicity [11, 12], whereas lowdose decitabine could be a reasonable preferred adoptive
choice for the treatment of advanced HCC. Thus, we
felt compelled to conduct a thorough verification of the
efficacy and safety of lower-dose decitabine therapy in
patients with advanced HCC.
The reported lowest total dose of decitabine that
has been used to treat a solid tumor was 50 mg/m2, but
the administration was accompanied by a variety of
adverse events (AEs) [7, 11, 12]. Our previous study
has confirmed that low-dose decitabine treatment could
reverse DNA methylation and induce the re-expression of
known epigenetically regulated genes in patients’ PBMCs

(peripheral blood mononuclear cells) [13]. On that basis,
we de-escalated the dose of decitabine in our phase I/II
trial to 6 mg/m2/d for 5 days of therapy. In this study, we
report the results of the efficacy and safety evaluation of
the very first phase I/II study of lower-dose decitabine
based therapy in Chinese patients with advanced HCC.

Results
Patient characteristics
All 15 patients finished 2 to 8 cycles of treatment.
The baseline demographics characteristics are shown
in Table 1. The median age was 55 years (range, 38-66
years). Performance status ranged from ECOG (Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group) of 0 to 2. Liver function
was rated as Child-Pugh Class A in 13 of 15 patients
(86.66%). Twelve patients (80%) had chronic HBV
infection, and 3 (20%) were negative for HBV and
HCV. Eight patients (53.33%) had metastatic disease
at the time of study entry. The most frequently affected
metastatic sites were the lung (3), adrenal gland (1) and
retroperitoneal lymph node (4).
Cohort 1 was opened at the time of study entry based
on the overlarge tumor lesion (max diameter ≥ 10 cm) of
the two patients UPN11 and UPN 12 (Figures 1 and 2,
Table 2). TACE (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization)

was regarded as the priority treatment for the HCC
patients with larger tumors according to the Clinical
Practice Guideline of Primary Liver Cancer of China.
Therefore, the 2 patients from cohort 1 underwent TACE
before lower-dose decitabine administration to maximize
the clinical benefit of the patients from the present trial.
For the two patients from cohort 2, UPN9 and
UPN10, strategy was lower-dose decitabine treatment
alone until the growth of metastases, then combined with
systemic chemotherapy (Figures 1 and 2, Table 2). Based
on the clinical guideline of China, the more tolerable
first-line chemotherapy regimen, capecitabine, was given
orally at the dose of 1.25g/m2 2 times per day. The drug
was administrated on 14 consecutive days followed the
decitabine treatment in cycle 3 and 4.
Percutaneous radio-frequency ablation (PRFA)
was performed on all 5 patients of cohort 3 as required
by progression of HCC foci based on MRI (magnetic
resonance imaging) scan (Figures 1 and 2, Table 2). Of
the 5 enrolled patients of cohort 3, 2 patients, UPN2 and
UPN3, received argon-helium cryosurgery followed by
4 cycles of lower-dose decitabine treatment. Meanwhile,
microwave ablation (MWA) was performed on the other
3 patients, UPN6, UPN8 and UPN13, after 3 cycles and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

followed by 1 cycle of decitabation treatment.
The remaining 5 patients was treated for 3 to 6
cycles of lower-dose decitabine monotherapy and assigned
to cohort 4 (Figures 1 and 2, Table 2).

Safety and toxicity
The lower-dose decitabine based treatment was
generally well tolerated throughout the study, and none
of the 15 patients withdrew from the study because of
adverse events. The most commonly reported AEs were
hematologic toxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Leukopenia was the most common hematologic toxicity,
especially within the first 2 cycles (grade 1 to 2; n=10,
62.5%), and white blood cell (WBC) counts improved
after adjuvant treatment. Neutropenia was also reported
in 3 patients (18.75%, grade 1 to 2). The gastrointestinal
symptoms were mainly reported as mild anorexia (n=7,
43.75%), nausea (n=31.25, 30%), vomiting (n=1, 6.25%)
and constipation (n=1, 6.25%), and did not required
clinical intervention. Some other mild AEs were also
observed and are summarized in Table 3. Grade 3 or 4
toxicity was not observed in any of the 15 patients during
the entire study. Furthermore, the platelet counts increased
16701

Oncotarget

with therapy was not statistically significant, while the
reduced level of platelet counts of most enrolled patients
were noted at baseline (Table 4).
Because decitabine was the causative event of the
compromised liver functions in previous studies [11, 12],
we focused on the evaluation of hepatotoxicity in this
phase I/II study. The complete liver enzyme profiles were
analyzed after every 2 cycles of the therapy (Table 4). The
majority patients experienced descending ALT (alanine
aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase)
levels, but γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) levels were
still modestly high in the majority of patients. Intriguingly,
the levels of albumin and total protein fluctuated within
the normal range in the duration of exposure. The other
liver enzymes that leaked into the peripheral blood were
not obviously altered by the lower-dose decitabine based
treatment that was used in this study. These results suggest
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that decitabine exerts extremely mild hepatotoxicity
effects at the lower dose used in this phase I/II trial and
was relatively safe for patients with advanced HCC.

Efficacy
All 15 eligible patients who received 2 to 8 cycles
of treatment patients were assessable for response. In
the overall population, one patient achieved a complete
response (CR) (6.67%), six patients experienced stable
disease (SD) (40%) and 8 had progressive disease
(PD) (53.33%) (Table 4), clinical benefit rate (CR +
SD rate) was 46.67%. By the end of our data sorting
(a follow-up time of ~14 months), the median PFS
(progression-free survival) and OS (overall survival) of
the corporate patients were 4 and 11 months (95% CI

[confidence interval], 1.7–7 months and 8.9–14.6 months)
(Supplementary Figure S1).
The PFS of cohort 1 and 3 were basically coincident
based their similar therapeutic schemes (lower-dose
decitabine combined with palliative local treatment).
Patient UPN15 had progressed and exited after 2 cycles
treatment. The PFS of 2 patients in cohort 2 was significant
shorter than the other cohorts mainly because of the
progression of their metastatic lesion (Table 5). Their
liver lesions remained SD; if considered liver condition
separately, PFS time would be significantly prolonged.
Patient UPN2 of cohort 3 received a total of 8 cycles of
therapy and achieved stable disease, 6 months after which
he died due to clinical deterioration. The extension of PFS
of cohort 4 was most significant based on their favourable
response to the lower dose decitabine. Patient UPN7 in
cohort 4 achieved CR for 11 months. However, the death
of UPN14 occurred after 3 cycles of treatment due to
disease progression and treatment discontinuation.
Notably, MRI image of patient UPN1, who received
lower-dose decitabine treatment only and achieved SD,
displayed a unique characteristic at the T2 phase after
the decitabine treatment (Figure 3). The density of the
occupying lesions was not homogeneous and appeared
as a central opaque area surrounded by a much more
translucent texture, similar to the structure of a “fried
egg” (Figure 3). The MRI signal indicated that the lesions
were organized as tumor, necrosis and inflammation tissue
from the inside to the outside. This organization was most

obvious in 3 phases (hepatic arterial phase [HAP], portal
venous phase [PVP] and delayed phase [DP]) identified
by contrast-enhanced MRI imaging (Figure 3). The other
patients presented similar MRI scanning images within
their SD period, but the organization was not as clear as
patient UPN1 (Figure 4).
To confirm the structural characteristics of the
occupying lesions that were observed by MRI scanning,
percutaneous CT (computerized tomography)-guided
liver biopsies should have been performed before other
therapeutic regimen added. Unfortunately, only 4 patients
(UPN1, UPN2, UPN6 and UPN13) received the biopsy
assessment, whereas none of the others consented to a
biopsy. The clinicopathologic analysis of liver biopsy of
patient UPN1 confirmed the structural characteristics: few
to no HCC cells with extensive necrosis surrounded by
swollen hepatocyte and exhibited CD8+ cell infiltration,
suggesting SD other than PD according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Figure 3).
The immunohistochemical staining from patients UPN2
presented a similar situation but CD4+ cell infiltration
(Figure 4).

Pharmacodynamics analyses
To assess the biological activity of the lower-dose
decitabine, we investigated the changes in expression
levels of the direct target of decitabine DNMT1 (DNA

events. The most common reported AE was leukopenia,
consisting with previous studies demonstrating the noncytotoxic mechanism of decitabine [18]. Whereas, the
platelet counts did not increase significantly but fluctuated
with the treatment, which might be attributed to the poor
liver function and aberrant platelet count at the base line.
Furthermore, a lack of direct cytotoxicity from lower-dose
decitabine may contribute to a reduction in liver toxicity,
and no obvious hepatotoxicity was observed in any of the
15 enrolled patients in our study. Although the cohort of
this current study is relative small, the results have clearly
demonstrated that the specific treatment regimen is safe
with a limited adverse event profile. The single-agent
decitabine regimen at the lower dose used in our trial may
be an attractive and safe approach.
The proposed mechanism of action of low-dose
decitabine is hypomethylation of DNA, which ultimately
“normalizes” the gene expression profile of cancer
and modulates multiple tumor signaling pathways
simultaneously [19, 20]. The epigenetic mechanism of
action of lower-dose decitabine is S-phase dependent,
requiring overlap between drug exposure time and
cancer S-phase entries [21, 22]. Moreover, the rapid
disappearance of decitabine has been detected in plasma
and demanded a longer duration of therapy due to the
short half-life of decitabine [18, 22, 23]. Considering the
S-phase dependent mechanism and short in vivo half-life,
the ideal administration of decitabine should be the long
enough duration of therapy to permit all the cancer cells
to enter the S-phase of the cell cycle. In this context, the
unacceptable hematopoietic toxicity would hamper the
clinical application of decitabine [22]. Fortunately, it
has been demonstrated that longer infusion schedules of
decitabine administration would be as effective as repeated
shorter infusions, in light of the asynchronization of cell
cycle of cancer cells and the antitumor “memory” response
produced by the exposure to low-dose decitabine [20, 24,
25]. In the present trial, a consecutive 5-day intravenous
push of lower-dose decitabine was performed during each
28-day treatment cycle, consistent with the traditional
administration of S-phase dependent anti-cancer drugs
to ensure the safety of the evaluated decitabine therapy.
However, as previously described, the subcutaneous
administration and/or increased exposure time of
decitabine might promise the more favorable clinical
benefits and AE profile [18, 23]. The administration of
decitabine possessed significant logistic challenges, and
the assessment of efficacy of different schemes of lowerdose decitabine are warranted in our now-ongoing phase
II study.
Higher proliferation rate was an important hallmark
of tumor cells, and the S-phase-specific mechanism of
action of lower-dose decitabine has been documented
[18, 23]. Based on these, we hypothesized that the DNA
incorporation of decitabine might be higher in tumor
cells than the surrogate tissues (PBMCs). This should

(cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1). Since the pretreatment
tumor biopsy material was not available in the current trial,
the measurement of DNMT1 expression was performed
with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by
western blot analysis. The elevated gene expression of
DNMT1 was observed in PBMCs of 8 patients treated
with lower-dose decitabine on day 6 of cycle 2 (Figure
5). Furthermore, the global DNA hypomethylation by
decitabine was demonstrated by the downward trend in
methylation of LINE-1 repetitive elements (Figure 5).
Collectively, our data suggested that the lower dose of
decitabine could demethylate and re-express some tumorrelated genes, and this at least partially contributes to antitumor activity of lower-dose decitabine based therapy in
patients with advanced HCC.

Discussion
In this phase I/II study, we confirmed the safety
and efficacy of lower-dose decitabine in heavily
pretreated patients with advanced HCC. Decitabine was
administered at a dose far below the maximally tolerated
dose (6 mg/m2/d), which has a confirmed pharmacological
demethylation effect on PBMCs [13]. The disease control
rate (CR + SD rate) was up to 46.67%. The treatment
prolonged PFS and OS to 4 and 11 months in patients
with advanced HCC, which is superior to the estimated
3.3 and 9.1 months, respectively [14]. The lower-dose
decitabine exhibited a favorable AEs profile for patients
with advanced HCC. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study of the application of lower-dose decitabine,
a hypomethylating agent, for antitumor therapy of patients
with advanced HCC.
The liver has been noted as the main detoxifying
organ for decitabine because of the enrichment of cytidine
deaminase (CDA). Saunthararajah proposed that in the
liver, there might be a reduction of the concentration of
decitabine to a sub-therapeutic level [3, 15]. However,
these conclusions were based on the existence of
the normal tissue architecture of liver, but one of
characteristics of HCC is the loss of cell polarity and
decrement of liver function [16], and this may result in a
deficiency in the CDA enzyme system and prolonged halflife of decitabine in primary HCC patients. The specific
SD of liver lesions in cohort 2 indicated that this might be
the pivotal factor for clinical effectiveness and favorable
hepatotoxicity. The speculation and our results merit
additional focused investigation.
A favorable adverse event profile was observed in
this phase I/II study, which was highlighted by the finding
that only grade 1-2 adverse events were observed. The
AEs were predictable and manageable. In most cases of
the prior reported studies, the administration of decitabine
was either combined with other anticancer agents, or it
was administered alone at a relatively high dose [7, 17],
which resulted in additional serious grade 3-4 toxicity

radiographically measurable disease of ≥ 1 cm in the
largest dimension by a traditional CT scanning technique
or ≥ 1 cm in the largest dimension by spiral CT scanning;
ECOG performance status of 0 to 2; Child-Pugh class
A to B liver disease; and adequate hepatic, hematologic
and renal function (WBC ≥ 3000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 8.0
g/L, platelets ≥ 50000/μL, AST and ALT ≤ 3 times the
upper limit of normal [ULN], total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/
dL, serum albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dL, serum creatinine ≤ 1.5
times the ULN). The following exclusion criteria were
applied: anticancer therapy (including chemotherapy,
radiation therapy and immunotherapy) within 3 weeks
prior to the first dose; active serious infection; receipt
of any other investigational agents or decitabine;
severe cardiac insufficiency; history of organ allograft;
immunodeficiency; known history of HIV infection;
significant neuropathy; pregnancy or lactation; and
unsuitability for the trial, based on clinical judgment

be confirmed by the pharmacodynamics analysis in both
tumor tissue samples and PBMCs. The primary design of
the current trial was to perform the HCC biopsies after
4 cycles of decitabine treatment, but unfortunately only
part of patients consented a biopsy. Moreover, because
the pretreatment biopsies were not mandated in this trial,
we did not have available pretreatment tumor tissues.
Thus, the pharmacodynamics analyses of the tumor tissue
samples were not executable, and we will determine the
pharmacodynamics effect of lower-dose decitabine in
tumor cells of HCC in our future study.
Numerous laboratorial and clinical data have
indicated that low-dose decitabine has the ability to
affect the activity and differentiation of immune cells
and the expression of cancer cell surface makers [24,
26]. Additionally, previous reports demonstrated that
3-5% of the genes modulated by low-dose decitabine
in PBMCs were immunomodulatory genes [24]. Thus,
we could draw the hypothesis that low-dose decitabine
may play a critical role in the epigenetic reprogramming
that is related to the immune reconstruction in the tumor
bed. The immunohistochemical analysis of the liver
biopsy tissue of UPN1 and UPN2 indicated massive
inflammatory cell infiltration of tumor bed. The different
subtypes of infiltrating T cells (CD8+ and CD4+) may be
the foundation of their distinct outcomes (SD and PD).
Although the results were not amenable to statistical
analysis because of the low patient number, our data were
nonetheless supportive of our proposed hypothesis. Our
phase I/II study is the first analysis of the in vivo effects
of decitabine on the immunology of solid tumor patients,
but the effect of decitabine needs to be examined and
confirmed in future trials with a larger number of patients.
In summary, we confirmed the tolerance and
antitumor activity for the lower-dose decitabine based
therapy in patients with advanced HCC. This report
describes a small phase I/II study, and it is difficult to
draw a solid conclusion about the mechanism of action
and determine efficacy assessment criteria. This study
nevertheless highlights several possible attractive
investigational directions of clinical and laboratory
decitabine research, and further clinical trials of this
lower-dose regimen of decitabine should be considered.

Study design
This phase I/II study protocol conforms to the
ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki
as reflected in a priori approval by the Ethics Committee
of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. The study was
conducted from August 2012 to June 2014. The present
study was undertaken in accordance with the Clinical
Practice Guideline of Primary Liver Cancer of China
(National Health and Family Planning Commission of the
People’s Republic of China, 2011). Based on the guideline,
in order to ensure the clinical benefits of patients, the
patients were divided into four cohorts and given different
additional treatments. At least 2 patients were accrued
to each cohort (Figure 1). The rationale for the cohorts
was as follows: cohort 1, the patients, tumor diameter of
whom ≥ 10 cm at the time of study entry, received TACE
followed by lower-dose decitabine treatment; cohort
2, systemic chemotherapy with the first-line drugs was
given to the patients, who experienced progression of
metastasis during the decitabine treatment cycles; cohort
3, PRFA was performed between the cycles of decitabine
treatment when the progression was indicated by MRI
scan; cohort 4, the lower-dose decitabine monotherapy
group. Decitabine (DacoGen, Pharmachemie BV) was
administrated at 6mg/m2/d by intravenous push on day1 to
5 of each 28-day treatment cycle. Decitabine was stored
as a stable freeze-dried powder, reconstituted in 10 mL of
sterile water, and diluted to a final volume of 25 mL for
injection immediately before use.

Materials and Methods
Patients
Written informed consent was obtained from
each enrolled patient of this Phase I/II study. Eligible
patients were aged from 18 to 85 years old and had
pathologically or clinically proven advanced HCC after 1
to 3 prior anticancer regimens were completed. Additional
eligibility criteria were as follows: at least one site of

MRI was used to confirm the treatment response
after every cycle of therapy, and the same imaging
modality was used at baseline and follow-ups. In
addition, if the physical condition of the patient allowed,
a percutaneous CT-guided liver biopsy was performed to
further assess responses within the first 30 days after the
4th cycle of treatment. Efficacy variables were evaluated,
including the objective response definition, PFS and OS.
Tumor responses were assessed in a blinded manner using
RECIST 1.0 combined with the pathological analysis
of the liver biopsies. PFS was defined as the time from
randomization to the first documentation of disease
progression or death. OS was defined as the time from the
starting treatment to the date of death.

A phase II study of epigenetic therapy with hydralazine and
magnesium valproate to overcome chemotherapy resistance
in refractory solid tumors. Annals of oncology : official
journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology /
ESMO. 2007; 18:1529-1538.

The safety population (all patients who received 2
to 8 cycles of treatment) was used for all analyses. All
data were summarized using simple description statistics
for the continuous assessment of safety and efficacy for
lower-dose decitabine in patients with advanced HCC.
