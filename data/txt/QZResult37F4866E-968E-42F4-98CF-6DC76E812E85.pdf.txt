BACKGROUND: This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of gabapentin for the treatment of pain syndromes
related to radiation-induced mucositis in patients with head and neck cancers treated with concurrent chemoradiation. METHODS: Data from 42 patients with head and neck malignancies treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy
using an intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique were analyzed. Gabapentin was initiated in the second week of
radiotherapy. Opiates were prescribed in addition to gabapentin as clinically indicated to obtain adequate pain control. RESULTS: At a median dose of 2700 mg/day of gabapentin, only 33% and 55% of patients required additional
low-dose narcotic medications for pain control during the third and fourth week of treatment, respectively, despite
exhibiting a grade 2 or higher mucositis in 71% and 86% of the patients, respectively. Furthermore, during the last
weeks of treatment, 71% of the patients required additional low-dose opiates for adequate pain control, despite the
presence of grade 2 or higher mucositis in 95% and 100% of patients at Weeks 5 and 6, respectively. Only 1 patient
had a treatment-related interruption of >3 days during chemoradiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin appears to
be promising in reducing the need for high total doses of opioids and avoiding unplanned treatment interruptions for
patients with head and neck malignancies treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy and should be further evalC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Patients undergoing radiotherapy for the head and neck malignancies develop painful mucositis, which often result

in decreased oral intake, weight loss, decreased quality of life, and unforeseen treatment interruptions.1,2 Concurrent
chemotherapy with radiotherapy is associated with a significantly increased frequency, severity, and duration of oral
mucositis.1 The pathogenesis of radiation-induced mucositis is multifactorial and appears to be more complex than direct
damage to the epithelium.3,4 Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with head and neck cancer experience nociceptive and neuropathic pain during their radiotherapy course, suggesting the need to treat both types of pain.5
Although opioids are the mainstay for the treatment of cancer pain management, their use is limited not only by
common side effects such as depression, sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, and respiratory depression,
but also by the fact that neuropathic pain responds poorly to narcotics and requires escalating doses.6-8
Gabapentin has been effectively used to treat multiple neuropathic pain syndromes such as chronic pain, diabetic
neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and postoperative pain, but to the best of our knowledge only
limited data exist regarding its efficacy for other pain syndromes.9-14 Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of

gabapentin in improving the pain control in patients with
neuropathic cancer pain who already have been treated
with opiates.15
We previously demonstrated that gabapentin at median doses of 2700 mg/day appeared promising in reducing the need for narcotic pain medication for patients
with head and neck malignancies treated with intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) without concurrent
chemotherapy.14 In the current retrospective review, we
evaluated the efficacy of gabapentin for the treatment of
pain syndrome related to radiation-induced mucositis for
patients with head and neck tumors treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
The information for this retrospective analysis was collected from the medical records of patients treated in the
Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of
Pennsylvania. Institutional Review Board approval was
granted for the conduct of this study. The study cohort
was represented by 42 patients diagnosed with head and
neck cancer and treated with concurrent chemoradiation
between December 2003 and November 2006. Patient
characteristics are shown in Table 1. Patients already taking narcotic pain medications before chemoradiation
treatments were excluded from this retrospective review.

Surgery
Eighteen (43%) patients underwent surgical resection of
the primary tumor and were treated postoperatively with
concurrent chemoradiation. Unilateral or bilateral selective neck dissections were performed in 14 (33%) of the
patients before chemoradiotherapy.
Radiotherapy
Radiation was delivered using IMRT that incorporated a
simultaneous in-field boost technique. Radiotherapy was
delivered to the primary tumor site and bilateral cervical
lymph nodes in all patients.
For the patients who were biopsied only and undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy, median doses of
57.6 Grays (Gy) (range, 50-61.25 Gy), 64 Gy (range, 5470 Gy), and 70.4 Gy (range, 66-75.6 Gy) were delivered
to the low-risk planning target volume (LRPTV), highrisk planning target volume (HRPTV), and macroscopic
tumor volume, respectively. The median dose per fraction
prescribed was 1.8 Gy (range, 1.75-2 Gy) to the LRPTV,
2.1 Gy (range, 2.0-2.1 Gy) to the HRPTV, and 2.2 Gy
(range, 2.0-2.2 Gy) to the macroscopic tumor volume. A
median of 32 (range, 29-35) treatment fractions were
delivered.
For the patients treated with postoperative chemoradiotherapy, median doses of 54 Gy (range, 54-61.25 Gy),
60 Gy (range, 60-63 Gy), and 66 Gy (range, 60-66 Gy)
were delivered to the LRPTV, HRPTV, and boost target

volume, respectively. The dose per fraction prescribed was
1.8 Gy to the LRPTV, 2 Gy or 2.1 Gy to the HRPTV,
and 2.1 Gy or 2.2 Gy to the boost target volume. Thirty
treatment fractions were delivered to all patients receiving
postoperative concurrent chemoradiation.
All patients were treated once daily to all target
volumes, 5 fractions per week, with 6-megavolt photons
using a simultaneous boost technique. The median number of beams used for the IMRT treatment delivery was 7
beams (range, 6-14 beams).
Chemotherapy
All patients in this cohort received systemic therapy during their radiotherapy. Twenty-one patients (50%)
received platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens
delivered every 3 weeks: cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2
every 3 weeks in 19 patients, cisplatin at a dose of 75
mg/m2 combined with etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m2
on Days 1 to 3 every 3 weeks in 1 patient, and cisplatin at
a dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks combined with weekly
cetuximab at a dose of 400 mg/m2 on Day 1 followed by
weekly C225 at a dose of 250 mg/m2 thereafter in 1
patient. Eighteen patients (43%) received weekly systemic
therapy, including weekly carboplatin (area under the
curve, 2) and weekly paclitaxel at a dose of 30 mg/m2 in
17 patients and weekly C225 at a dose of 400 mg/m2 on
Day 1 followed by weekly C225 at a dose of 250 mg/m2
thereafter for 1 patient. The concurrent chemotherapeutic
regimen was unknown in 3 patients (7%). Seven patients
(17%) in this group received induction chemotherapy
before concomitant chemoradiation.
Pain Medication
Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 600 mg taken at
bedtime in the second week of chemoradiation. The dose
was gradually increased over 1 week to 900 mg taken 3
times per day for a total daily dose of 2700 mg/day. The
dosage of gabapentin used in this study was in accordance
with the published literature demonstrating that, at doses
of 1800 to 3600 mg/day, gabapentin was effective in the
treatment of adults with neuropathic pain.16 Opiate pain
medication (oxycodone) was prescribed as needed in addition to gabapentin in response to the patient’s subjective
pain scores. For patients who did not tolerate oral oxycodone, additional parenteral fentanyl or other opioids were
prescribed and an equianalgesic dose ratio between different opioids was used to convert their specific dose to an
oxycodone-equivalent dose.17

Feeding Tube Placement
Thirty-nine (93%) patients underwent a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement to maintain adequate nutrition for the duration of chemoradiotherapy and the weeks following. This practice reflects our
institutional policy recommending prophylactic PEG
tube placements for all patients receiving concurrent
chemoradiotherapy. All but 1 patient had the feeding
tube placed before the initiation of concurrent chemoradiation. One patient underwent placement of the feeding
tube in the last few weeks of treatment due to weight loss
and need for frequent intravenous hydration. Three (7%)
patients refused feeding tube placement for the entire
duration of treatment.
Toxicity Assessment
Radiation-induced mucositis was assessed for each patient
on a weekly basis using Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Grade 0 mucositis was defined as no oral cavity or oropharyngeal mucosal changes. Grade 1 mucositis was defined as erythema of
the mucosa. Grade 2 mucositis was defined as a patchy
pseudomembranous reaction (patches measuring
1.5 cm in dimension and noncontiguous). Grade 3
mucositis was defined as confluent pseudomembranous
reaction (contiguous patches measuring >1.5 cm in
dimension). Grade 4 mucositis was defined as necrosis or
deep ulceration.
Dysphagia due to radiation was assessed for each
patient on a weekly basis using CTCAE. Grade 0 dysphagia was defined as no swallowing difficulty. Grade 1 dysphagia was defined as difficulty swallowing but still able
to eat a regular diet. Grade 2 dysphagia was defined as difficulty swallowing requiring predominantly a pureed,
soft, or liquid diet. Grade 3 dysphagia was defined as difficulty swallowing requiring feeding tube, intravenous
hydration, or hyperalimentation. Grade 4 dysphagia was
defined as complete obstruction (not able to swallow
saliva), ulceration with bleeding not induced by minor
trauma or abrasion, or perforation.
Patients were monitored on a weekly basis and examined for other treatment-related toxicity, such as pain control, and adjustments to their pain medication schedule
were made accordingly. The technique for evaluation of
mucositis was primarily by means of intraoral examination.
However, for the patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancers
and for the patients diagnosed with nonlaryngeal tumors
who developed severe treatment-related toxicity, nasopharyngolaryngoscopy was performed as needed during the

duration of chemoradiotherapy and regularly the following
weeks after the end of the treatment.
Side effects of gabapentin and additional pain medication were recorded on a weekly basis.
Statistical Analysis
Subgroup differences in grade of mucositis at Week 1
through Week 6, dichotomized between grades 0 and 2
versus grade 3, were tested using the Fisher exact test or
Pearson chi-square test. Subgroups analyzed included
patients with laryngeal (7 patients) versus nonlaryngeal
(35 patients) primary site of disease, as well as patients
who received cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimens
delivered every 3 weeks (21 patients) versus patients who
received weekly chemotherapeutic regimens (18 patients).
Early opioid use during the second week of radiotherapy was reported. Subgroup differences in early
opioid use were tested using the Pearson chi-square test
for patients who underwent surgery before radiotherapy
(18 patients) versus patients who did not undergo surgery
(24 patients) before their radiotherapy.
All P values for proportional differences in the subgroups analyzed were 2-sided and considered significant if
<.05. Analysis was performed with JMP for Windows statistical software, version 8.0.1 (JMP Macintosh product
for Microsoft Windows statistical software).

RESULTS
The median age of the patients in this cohort was 53 years
(range, 30-78 years). The median duration of follow-up
was 6 months (range, 1-33 months).
Mucositis Due to Radiation
All patients in the current study developed mucositis
necessitating narcotic pain medication. Grades 1 and 2
mucositis occurred during the first 2 weeks of chemoradiotherapy in 37 (88%) patients, with half of these
patients experiencing grade 2 mucositis during the second
week of treatment. No grade 3 mucositis was reported
during the first 2 weeks. By the third and fourth week of
treatment, grade 2 or higher mucositis was present in
71% and 86% of the patients, respectively. The incidence
of grade 3 mucositis increased to 17% during the third
week of radiation and to 45% of patients by the fourth
week of chemoradiation. Approximately 95% of the
patients in the current study developed grade 2 or 3 mucositis by the fifth week of treatment, with 60% of the
patients presenting with grade 3 mucositis. All patients in

this cohort experienced grade 2 or higher mucositis by the
sixth week of treatment, with 81% of the patients exhibiting grade 3 mucositis. Twenty-two patients undergoing 7
weeks of treatment experienced grade 2 or 3 mucositis,
with 77% demonstrating grade 3 mucositis. No grade 4
mucositis was reported for this study group. These results
are illustrated in Figure 1.
Severity of Radiation-Induced Mucositis
(‡ Grade 3 Mucositis as Opposed to
Grades 0 to 2) for Patients With Laryngeal
Versus Nonlaryngeal Sites of Disease
No grade 3 or higher mucositis was reported during the
first 2 weeks of radiotherapy. There was no statistically
significant difference with regard to severity of mucositis
( grade 3 mucositis vs grades 0-2) between patients with
laryngeal sites of disease versus patients with nonlaryngeal
tumors at Week 3 of radiotherapy (Fisher P value, .326).
The difference in severity of mucositis ( grade 3 mucositis
vs grades 0-2) between the groups of patients with laryngeal
versus nonlaryngeal primary sites of disease at Week 4 of
radiotherapy was statistically significant (Fisher P value,
.011), with a larger proportion of grade 3 or higher mucositis reported for patients with laryngeal primary sites of disease. However, the difference in severity of mucositis (
grade 3 mucositis vs grades 0-2) between the groups of
patients with laryngeal versus nonlaryngeal primary site of
disease returned to a statistically nonsignificant level during
the last weeks of radiotherapy (Fisher P value, .099 for
Week 5 and Fisher P value, 1.0 for Week 6, respectively).

Severity of Radiation-Induced Mucositis
(‡ Grade 3 Mucositis Versus Grades 0-2) for
Patients Who Received Concurrent CisplatinBased Chemotherapeutic Regimens Delivered
Every 3 Weeks Versus Patients Who Received
Weekly Chemotherapeutic Regimens
No grade 3 or higher mucositis was reported during the
first 2 weeks of radiotherapy. There was no statistically
significant difference in severity of mucositis ( grade 3
mucositis vs grades 0-2) between patients who received
cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimens delivered every 3 weeks versus patients who received weekly chemotherapeutic regimens at Weeks 3 and 4 of radiotherapy
(Pearson P value, .138 for Week 3 and Pearson P value,
.083 for Week 4 of radiotherapy, respectively). However,
the difference in severity of mucositis ( grade 3 mucositis vs grades 0-2) between patients who received cisplatinbased chemotherapeutic regimens delivered every 3 weeks
versus patients treated with weekly concurrent chemotherapeutic regimens achieved statistical significance at Week
5 and 6 of radiotherapy, with a larger proportion of
patients who received weekly chemotherapeutic regimens
found to develop severe mucositis (Pearson P value, .054
for Week 4 and Pearson P value, .014 for Week 6,
respectively).
Dysphagia Related to Radiotherapy
Forty (95%) patients in this study developed grade 1, 2,
or 3 dysphagia at some point during their treatment
course. Only 2 (5%) patients reported difficulty with
swallowing (grade 1 dysphagia) at the end of the first week
of treatment. However, 16 (38%) patients experienced
grade 1 or 2 dysphagia by Week 2, and 22 (52%) patients
by Week 3. By Week 4, 32 (76%) patients experienced
swallowing difficulty, 15 of whom (36%) reported grade
2 or 3 dysphagia. Swallowing difficulty was reported in 40
(95%) patients by Weeks 5 and 6, with 20 (48%) patients
reporting grade 2 or 3 dysphagia. Dysphagia remained
stable during the seventh week of treatment. No grade 4
dysphagia was reported for this study cohort.
Pain Management
No patient required pain medication during the first week
of treatment in this study. Three (7%) patients in this
cohort refused the use of gabapentin for their pain management and were treated with only opiates at some point
during their course of chemoradiotherapy; the opioid
doses were gradually increased during the course of chemoradiotherapy for a better pain control. During the last

4210

weeks of treatment, 2 of these patients received 90 mg/day
of oxycodone-equivalent and 1 patient was treated with
180 mg/day of oxycodone-equivalent. One patient was
treated with opioids only at a dose of 90 mg/day of oxycodone-equivalent for the majority of his course of chemoradiotherapy, and agreed with to the addition of gabapentin
at a dose of 2700 mg/day for better pain control only during the last 2 weeks of radiotherapy. Gabapentin was initiated in the second week of radiotherapy in 38 (90.5%)
patients, with only 5 (12%) patients using an additional
median dose of 10 mg/day of oxycodone-equivalent
(range, 5-65 mg/day) for satisfactory pain control. By
Week 3, 38 (90.5%) patients were prescribed a median
dose of 2700 mg/day of gabapentin, with only 14 (33%)
patients requiring an additional median dose of 10
mg/day of oxycodone-equivalent (range, 5-90 mg/day)
for adequate pain relief, despite the presence of grade 2 or
higher mucositis in 71% of these patients. During the
fourth week of chemoradiation, 38 (90.5%) patients continued on a median dose of 2700 mg/day of gabapentin;
only 23 (55%) patients required an additional median
dose of 30 mg/day of oxycodone-equivalent (range, 10150 mg/day) for adequate pain control, despite the presence of grade 2 or higher mucositis in 86% of these
patients. Finally, during the last weeks of treatment, 38
(90.5%) patients were continued on a median dose of
2700 mg/day of gabapentin, but 30 (71%) patients
required an additional median dose of 60 mg/day of oxycodone-equivalent (range, 10-180 mg/day) for adequate
pain control, despite the presence of grade 2 or higher
mucositis in 95% to 100% of patients. Pain medication
was continued through the last week of treatment, and for
several weeks after the end of chemoradiation. During follow-up after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients
were gradually weaned off of narcotic pain medication
first and then off of gabapentin.
In summary, no pain medication was required during the first week of radiotherapy and opioid use during
the second week of radiotherapy was reported at low doses.
There was no statistically significant difference in the early
use of opioids between patients who underwent surgery
before radiotherapy versus patients who did not undergo
surgery before radiotherapy (Pearson P value, .27).
Gabapentin-Related Toxicity
Gabapentin was well-tolerated by the majority of patients.
Only 2 (5%) patients experienced mild side effects, comprised of dizziness. These side effects were managed by
reducing the dose from 2700 mg/day to 1800 mg/day.

DISCUSSION
Radiation-induced oral mucositis is a common treatmentlimiting toxicity of chemoradiotherapy for head and neck
cancers. Oral mucositis presents initially as erythema of
the oral mucosa, which frequently progresses to erosion
and ulceration, causing severe pain.3,4 Radiation-induced
oral mucositis is potentially influenced by multiple factors, including primary tumor site, chemotherapeutic regimen delivered concurrently with radiotherapy, size of
radiation fields, and total doses of radiation.3 The difference in severity of mucositis ( grade 3 mucositis vs
grades 0-2) between the groups of patients with laryngeal
versus nonlaryngeal primary sites of disease at Week 4 of
radiotherapy was statistically significant, with a larger proportion of grade 3 or higher mucositis reported for
patients with laryngeal primary sites of disease; however,
the difference in severity of mucositis ( grade 3 mucositis vs grades 0-2) between the groups of patients with laryngeal versus nonlaryngeal primary sites of disease
returned to a statistically nonsignificant level during the
last weeks of radiotherapy. Nonetheless, we acknowledge
the limitations of the retrospective nature of the current
study and the small sample analyzed. Moreover, the difference in severity of mucositis ( grade 3 mucositis vs
grades 0-2) between patients who received cisplatin-based
chemotherapeutic regimens delivered every 3 weeks versus
patients who received weekly chemotherapeutic regimens
was statistically significantly different at Weeks 5 and 6 of
radiotherapy, with a larger proportion of grade 3 or higher
mucositis reported in the group of patients who received
weekly chemotherapeutic regimens. The majority of
patients receiving weekly systemic therapy in this cohort
were treated with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel. It is
likely that a higher rate of grade 3 or higher mucositis
reported in this group of patients was related to the addition of weekly paclitaxel concurrently with irradiation.
Hoffmann et al demonstrated that the dose-limiting toxicity for weekly paclitaxel delivered concurrently with
radiotherapy was oral mucositis; hematologic and other
nonhematologic toxicities were mild.18
Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with
head and neck cancer experience nociceptive and neuropathic pain during their radiotherapy course, suggesting
Cancer

the need to treat both types of pain.5 Moreover, neuropathic cancer pain appears to be less responsive to opioids
and represents a major problem in cancer pain
management.19
Gabapentin, initially developed as an antiepileptic
drug, was later discovered to be effective in the treatment
of neuropathic pain having antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic properties.9 To the best of our knowledge, the
mechanism of action of gabapentin for pain control is
unclear, but the most accepted hypotheses support a
reduced neurotransmitter release and attenuation of postsynaptic excitability in the spinal cord, through inhibition
of calcium currents by means of the high voltage-dependent calcium ion channels.20,21
Opiates and gabapentin are believed to interact
favorably through a simultaneous decrease in hyperexcitation and increased inhibition of nociception.19 Whether
these interactions are synergistic or merely additive
remains to be fully elucidated. Preclinical studies demonstrated that the combination of gabapentin and opiates
results in a synergistic effect.22 An enhanced analgesic
effect of morphine, resulting from the additional administration of gabapentin, was demonstrated in a recent clinical study in healthy volunteers.23 Furthermore, this
combination was found to be better in relieving neuropathic pain than escalating doses of opioid alone in cancer
patients or patients with painful diabetic neuropathy or
postherpetic neuralgia.19,24 The combination of gabapentin and morphine also had a beneficial effect on painrelated interference with daily activity, mood, sleep, and
quality of life.16,24 This combination of gabapentin and
opioids may represent a potential first-line regimen for
the management of pain in cancer patients.19 In the current study, gabapentin, at a median dose of 2700 mg/day,
appeared to reduce the need for high total doses of narcotic pain medication for satisfactory pain control in
patients with head and neck malignancies treated with
concurrent chemoradiation. The findings of the current
study suggest an adequate pain relief with the use of gabapentin and low-dose opioids, thereby reducing the risk of
adverse side effects traditionally associated with narcotics
in this group of cancer patients.
In addition to its symptomatic impact, oral mucositis increases the likelihood of unplanned treatment interruptions or delays in chemoradiotherapy.3 The negative
effect on survival and locoregional control of unplanned
radiotherapy breaks and prolongation of the duration of
treatment time for head and neck cancer patients has been
well documented in multiple studies.1,2 Only 1 patient in

4211

Original Article

the current study had an interruption of >3 days during
the treatment, related to chemoradiotherapy toxicity. The
findings of the current study have significant implications
in achieving better pain relief and allowing patients to
continue their radiotherapy without unplanned treatment
interruptions.
Furthermore, pain management using gabapentin is
associated with good drug tolerability, lack of serious toxicity, and ease of use. Gabapentin is not significantly
metabolized in the human body, is entirely excreted by
the glomerular filtration apparatus, is not protein-bound,
and has no significant drug interactions.23,24 Clinically,
gabapentin has been shown to be safe and well tolerated
without significant acute or chronic toxicity. In addition,
unlike narcotic medications that potentially have addictive and tolerance properties in certain patient populations, to our knowledge dependence on gabapentin has
not been reported to date.8,12,22 The current study findings are in accord with the previously mentioned reports
indicating that gabapentin is well-tolerated by the majority of patients. Only a few individuals experienced mild
side effects, comprised mainly of dizziness, which was
readily managed by reducing the dose of the drug.
Conclusions
The results of the current study support the use of gabapentin as both an effective and well-tolerated treatment
for pain related to radiation-induced mucositis in patients
with head and neck malignancies who are treated with
concurrent chemoradiation. Gabapentin appears promising in reducing the need for high total doses of opioids
and avoiding unplanned treatment interruptions for
patients with head and neck malignancies treated with
concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Given the potential benefits of gabapentin in combination with opioids for the
treatment of pain syndromes related to radiation-induced
mucositis, randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the role of this analgesic combination in this group of
cancer patients.
