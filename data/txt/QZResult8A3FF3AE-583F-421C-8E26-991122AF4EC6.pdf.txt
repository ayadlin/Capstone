ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high recurrence rate, and patients
exhibit poor survival mainly because intrahepatic metastasis is common. We
previously reported that let-7c down-regulation is significantly associated with
poor differentiation level in HCC. In the present study, we demonstrate that miR199a-5p and let-7c are frequently down-regulated in HCC cells and tissues, and low
expression of miR-199a-5p is correlated with tumor size, liver envelope invasion.
Furthermore, miR-199a-5p and let-7c cooperatively inhibit HCC cell migration and
invasion in vitro. MAP4K3 is identified as the direct target of miR-199a-5p and let-7c
and this regulation is further confirmed by luciferase reporter assays and Western
blotting. In addition, MAP4K3 functions as a metastasis promoter since the results
demonstrate that MAP4K3 could promote HCC cell migration and invasion. We also
find that miR-199a-5p and let-7c increase the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib.
Conclusions: We report that miR-199a-5p and let-7c cooperatively and efficiently
inhibit HCC cell migration and invasion by targeting the metastasis promoter MAP4K3 and
MAP4K3-mediated drug sensitization, suggesting that the use of miRNAs and sorafenib
in combination therapy may be a powerful approach to the treatment of HCC.

INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of highly
conserved non-protein-encoding short RNA molecules
that regulate genes at the post-transcriptional level [6].
Emerging evidence has indicated that many miRNAs are
dysregulated in HCC and that some specific miRNAs are
associated with metastasis, recurrence, and prognosis [7–9].
Moreover, some miRNAs, such as miR-122, miR-21,
miR-192, play important roles in regulating HCC growth,
apoptosis, migration and invasion [10–12]. The microRNA
let-7 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting Ras oncogenes
[13]. Takamizawa et al. reported that reduced expression
of let-7 in human lung cancer was associated with a
shorter postoperative survival [14]. Han and colleagues
demonstrated that let-7c functions as a metastasis
suppressor in colorectal cancer through its targeting of
MMP11 and PBX3 [15]. Most of important, there was
a report showed that let-7c induced apoptosis in HCC

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause
of cancer death in many Asian and African countries.
HCC causes approximately 662,000 deaths each year
worldwide, and approximately 55% of cases occur in
China [1–3]. The pathogenesis of HCC is a multistage
process that is typically associated with chronic liver
inflammation, liver cirrhosis or alcohol abuse [4, 5].
Despite great advances in screening for the disease,
HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, at which
it does not respond to radical treatment. Owing to the
high rate of recurrence and metastasis, advanced HCC
has a poor prognosis and a high fatality rate. Therefore,
the identification of new molecules involved in tumor
metastasis is a key step toward the development of novel
therapeutics.

in cooperation with an anti-cancer drug sorafenib [16].
Shen et al. demonstrated that miR-199a-5p was
consistently decreased in HCC tissues and cell lines, and
low miR-199a-5p expression contributes to increased cell
invasion by deregulation of DDR1 activity in HCC [17].
These studies suggest that let-7c and miR-199a-5p play a
crucial role in the growth and development of liver cancer.
However, the impact of let-7 and miR-199a on HCC
metastasis has received minimal attention.
In our previous study, we found that let-7c
expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissues,
and a correlation was noted between the decrease in let-7c
expression and poor differentiation level in HCC [18]. In
this study, we comprehensively investigated the biological
functions and underlying molecular mechanism of let-7c
and miR-199a-5p in HCC metastasis. The enhanced
expression of miR-199a-5p and let-7c significantly
inhibited HCC cell migration and invasion. Interestingly,
miR-199a-5p and let-7c exhibited combinatorial effects
on the decrease in HCC cell migration and invasion.
Furthermore, MAP4K3, a putative metastasis promoter in
HCC, was characterized as a direct and functional target of
let-7c and miR-199a-5p. miR-199a-5p and let-7c increased
the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib. These results
indicate a possible regulatory pathway involving mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) and a candidate target
for HCC treatment.

differentiation level in HCC. Moreover, in this study, we
first examined miR-199a-5p expression in 45 HCC tissues.
The results showed that the miR-199a-5p levels were
significantly decreased in HCC tissues compared with
pair-matched normal hepatic tissues (Figure 1A). We then
measured miR-199a-5p and let-7c expression in HCC cell
lines. As presented in Figure 1B and 1C, the expression
of mature miR-199a-5p and let-7c was lower in cells
with high metastatic ability (MHCC-97H, MHCC-97L)
than in those with relatively low or no metastatic potential
(HepG2, SMMC-7721, SNU-449, SNU-398). To
further investigate the correlation between miR-199a-5p
expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of
the 45 HCC patients. As shown Table 1, low expression
of miR-199a-5p was significantly correlated with tumor
size (p < 0.05), liver envelope invasion (p < 0.01). These
results suggested that the down-regulation of miR-199a-5p
and let-7c might be associated with HCC metastasis.

miR-199a-5p and let-7c cooperatively inhibit
HCC cell migration and invasion
Given that miR-199a-5p and let-7c expression might
be associated with the metastatic property of HCC, we
assessed whether miR-199a-5p and let-7c play an important
role in HCC cell migration and invasion. We first transfected
HepG2 and SNU-449 cell lines with miR-199a-5p and let-7c
agomirs and confirmed their overexpression through
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
(Supplementary Figure 1). Overexpression of miR-199a-5p
and let-7c significantly inhibited the migration of HepG2
and SNU-449 compared with the negative control group
(Figure 2A and 2B). In addition, the invasive capacities of
HepG2 and SNU-449 transfected with miR-199a-5p and
let-7c were substantially less than those of the negative
control group (Figure 2C and 2D). Importantly, miR-199a-5p
and let-7c exhibited combinatorial effects on the reduction

RESULTS
Expression of miR-199a-5p and let-7c is
decreased in HCC cell lines and tissues and is
associated with HCC metastasis
In our previous study, we found that let-7c
expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissues,
and low expression of let-7c is associated with poor

The expression of miR-199a-5p was normalized to that of U6 small nuclear RNA. (B, C) The expression of miR-199a-5p and let-7c was
determined by quantitative real-time PCR in HCC cell lines (HepG2, SMMC-7721, MHCC97-H, MHCC97-L, SNU-449 and SNU-398)
and the normal human liver cell line L-02. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and normalized to U6 expression.

of HCC cell migration and invasion (Figure 2E and 2F).
However, the migration and invasion of SMMC-7721 was
enhanced when endogenous miR-199a-5p and let-7c were
silenced with a miRNA inhibitor (Supplementary Figure 2).
Taken together, these results indicated that miR-199a-5p and
let-7c cooperatively inhibit HCC cell migration and invasion.

targets of let-7c [19], and forty-one candidate genes were
predicted to be possible targets of miR-199a-5p using the
three algorithms (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly,
only the MAP4K3 gene was predicted as a possible target of
both miR-199a-5p and let-7c (Figure 3A).
To determine whether MAP4K3 is a direct
target of miR-199-5p and let-7c, we generated a firefly
luciferase reporter vector containing the MAP4K3
3′-UTR (Figure  3B). For luciferase activity assays,
HepG2 cells were transfected with the vector along
with miRNAs. Relative luciferase activity was mildly
reduced by individual miRNAs, whereas transfection
with two miRNAs resulted in an approximate 70%
decrease, suggesting that these miRNAs act cooperatively
(Figure 3C). To further assess whether this reduction was
sequence specific, we generated a series of MAP4K3
3′-UTR fragments, including wild-type and mutant

and invasion, we first used the prediction algorithms

fragments that were inserted into the region downstream of
the luciferase reporter gene (Figure 3B). The two miRNAs
were transfected along with different MAP4K3 vectors
into HepG2 cells to test the binding ability of the miRNA
combination. The results indicate that the relative luciferase
activity of the wild-type was significantly decreased
compared with the mutant (Figure 3D), suggesting that
miR-199a-5p and let-7c suppress luciferase activity
cooperatively by directly targeting the 3′-UTR of MAP4K3.

analysis demonstrated that the endogenous protein level
of MAP4K3 was mildly decreased by individual miRNAs.
However, when both miRNAs were transfected together,
a significant decrease in the MAP4K3 protein level
was observed (Figure 4A). This finding was consistent
with the luciferase experiments described above.
Moreover, the silencing of both let-7c and miR-199a-5p
significantly increased the expression of MAP4K3 protein
(Figure 4B). However, the mRNA level of MAP4K3 was
not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by both miRNA agomirs
(Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting that MAP4K3
expression was inhibited by miR-199a-5p and let-7c
primarily at the post-transcriptional level. Taken together,
these results indicated that MAP4K3 down-regulation
requires the cooperation of miR-199a-5p and let-7c.
Previous reports have indicated that MAP4K3, a
member of the MAP4K family, plays a critical role in
migration and invasion [20]. To explore the biological
function of MAP4K3 in HCC cells, HepG2 cells were
infected with a lentivirus construct containing the

MAP4K3 gene or vector alone, and MAP4K3 expression
was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure  4C).
Remarkably, MAP4K3 overexpression strongly promoted
HCC migration and invasion (Figure 4E). In addition,
knockdown of endogenous MAP4K3 expression by
siRNA in HepG2 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease
in HCC cell migration and invasion (Figure 4D and 4F).
This phenotype was similar to that induced by the
overexpression of miR-199a-5p and let-7c.

(Figure 5C). As expected, transwell assays demonstrated
that the restoration of MAP4K3 expression significantly
promoted HCC cell migration and invasiveness initiated
by miR-199a-5p and let-7c (Figure 5D and 5E), suggesting
that the 3′-UTR region of MAP4K3 is required for the
actions of miR-199a-5p and let-7c. This result is consistent
with the binding site mutations in the luciferase assay.

of HCC cells to sorafenib, which down-regulates

Restoration of MAP4K3 expression promotes
miR-199a-5p and let-7c-mediated migration and
invasion in HCC cells

Previous reports have indicated that microRNAs
modulate the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
agents [16, 21]. Therefore, we next tested whether
miR-199a-5p and let-7c could sensitize HCC cells to
sorafenib. First, we treated HepG2 cells transfected with
miR-199a-5p and let-7c with the sorafenib. Cell survival
was measured by EDU assays, and cell metastasis was
measured by Transwell assays. EDU assays revealed that
transfected miR-199a-5p and let-7c caused a significant
decrease in cell numbers, a finding that was also observed in
cells transfected with siRNA against MAP4K3 (Figure 6A).
Sorafenib caused a significant decrease in cell numbers;
more importantly, sorafenib caused a further decrease in

To improve the delivery efficiency of the two
miRNAs and to evaluate the long-term stable expression,
we first established a lentiviral expression vector
carrying both miR-199a-5p and let-7c (Figure 5A) and
confirmed the expression of each miRNA in HepG2 cells
(Figure 5B). To further verify that the down-regulation
of MAP4K3 is involved in miR-199a-5p- and let-7cmediated suppression of tumorigenesis, we transfected
the coding sequence of MAP4K3 lacking the 3′-UTR into
HepG2 stably expressing miR-199a-5p and let-7c, and
MAP4K3 expression was confirmed by Western blotting

cell numbers in cells transfected both miR-199a-5p and
let-7c (Figure 6B and 6C). In addition, Transwell assays
revealed that the transfection of both miR-199a-5p and
let-7c in HepG2 cells significantly inhibited cell migration
and invasion treatment with sorafenib compared with the
controls (Figure 6D).
To understand the underlying mechanism, we
measured the level of phospho-MAP4K3 in HepG2 cells
treated with different concentrations of sorafenib. The
results indicate increased p-MAP4K3 levels in control
cells, and these levels were marginally reduced after
treatment with 10 μm sorafenib (Figure 6E and  6F).
Interestingly, the basal level of p-MAP4K3 was reduced
by at least 50% in HepG2 cells treated with 10 μm

sorafenib, and these levels were further reduced with
increasing concentrations of miR-199a-5p and let-7c
(Figure 6G and 6H). Taken together, these results revealed
that miR-199a-5p and let-7c expression promotes the
growth inhibitory property of sorafenib in HCC cells.

DISCUSSION
Here, we demonstrate that miR-199a-5p and let-7c
are commonly down-regulated in HCC cells and tissues
and cooperatively inhibit HCC cell migration and invasion
in vitro. A direct and functional target of both miR199a-5p and let-7c was also identified. The target gene,
MAP4K3, is frequently overexpressed and promotes

metastasis in HCC. Knockdown of endogenous MAP4K3
by siRNA exhibited similar effects to the overexpression
of miR-199a-5p and let-7c, whereas overexpression of
MAP4K3 abrogated miR-199a-5p- and let-7c-mediated
metastasis inhibition. Taken together, these findings
indicate that miR-199a-5p and let-7c play fundamental
roles in hepatic carcinogenesis, particularly in the process
of HCC metastasis.
Metastasis is one of the most important hallmarks of
cancer and is the main factor that leads to recurrence and
mortality in patients with malignant cancer, particularly
with HCC [22]. The long-term survival of HCC patients

after curative resection remains low, given the major
obstacle of a high recurrence rate, which is mainly due
to the spread of intrahepatic metastases. Therefore, the
identification of metastatic factors and an understanding
of the underlying molecular pathways involved in the
progression of metastasis are critical issues.
Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs
play a fundamental role in the invasion and metastasis
of HCC, and their involvement in common cellular
pathways make them valuable and comprehensive targets.
Yao et al. reported that aberrant expression of miR-30d
significantly promotes HCC cell invasion and metastasis

through targeting GNAI2 [23]. Tsai et al. suggested that
miR-122 affects HCC intrahepatic metastasis partially
via the regulation of ADAM17 [24]. Recent findings have
demonstrated that miR-199a-5p and let-7c are involved
in various biological and pathological processes. For
example, Shen et al. reported that the down-regulation
of miR-199a-5p not only is highly associated with HCC
invasion but also inhibits cell migration and invasion
by targeting discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) [17].
The let-7 miRNA family members are widely viewed as
tumor suppressors, particularly in lung cancer. Reports
have indicated that let-7 inhibits cancer cell proliferation
by repressing multiple genes, including RAS, CDK6 and
CDC25A [19, 25, 26]. In addition, Zhao et al. reported that
let-7c inhibits lung cancer cell migration and invasion by
targeting ITGB3 and MAP4K3 [20]. However, the data
remain scarce, and we must provide more evidence about
the role and underlying molecular mechanism of miR199a-5p and let-7c in HCC. In our study, we established
the role of miR-199a-5p and let-7c in HCC migration
and invasion. Moreover, we found that miR-199a-5p and
let-7c cooperatively target a single mRNA. This result
is consistent with those of previous reports [27, 28]. For
example, multiple miRNAs have been recently shown to
regulate GRP78 expression in various cancer cells [28].
Importantly, such studies have indicated that miRNA
networks tightly control gene expression.
To date, MAPK has been well established as an
important mediator of signaling from the cell surface
to the nucleus [29]. The MAPK pathway is involved in
various cellular functions, including cell proliferation,
differentiation and migration [30]. MAP4K3 upregulation in various tumor types is a major contributor to
tumorigenesis, such that Chung-Ping Hsu et al. reported
that MAP4K3 overexpression associates with recurrence
risk for non-small cell lung cancer [31]. There is date
showed that MAP4K3 as a novel apoptosis inducer which
modulates cell death via the post-transcriptional regulation
of BH3-only proteins in pancreatic cancer [32].We
reported that MAP4K3 promotes HCC cell migration and
invasion. Previous ﬁndings have indicated that miRNAmediated suppression of protein production potentially
occurs at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional
level [33, 34]. In this report, we demonstrate that miR199a-5p and let-7c cooperatively bind to the 3′-UTR of
MAP4K3 and dramatically decrease the protein levels of
MAP4K3, providing evidence in support of a mechanism
for MAP4K3 regulation at the post-transcriptional level.
Carlo-Stella demonstrated that the inhibition of the MAPK/
ERK pathway using siRNA increases the sensitivity of
lymphoma cells to sorafenib [35]. In our study, decreased
levels of MAP4K3 achieved using siRNA or transfection
of two miRNAs increase the sensitivity of cancer cells
to sorafenib, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell
growth, migration and invasion. Therefore, the use of two
specific miRNAs combined with sorafenib to target key
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

genes involved in tumorigenesis could provide an exciting
avenue for the development of new cancer therapies.

CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates that miR-199a-5p and let-7c
cooperatively inhibit HCC cell migration and invasion and
that the up-regulation of MAP4K3 subsequently promotes
tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance. Our results
suggest that two miRNAs in combination therapy may
provide a new and powerful approach for the treatment of
metastasis and drug-resistant HCC.

Cell culture and clinical samples
The human HCC cell lines HepG2 (ATCC no. HB8065), SNU-449 (ATCC no. CRL-2234), and SNU-398
(ATCC no. CRL-2233) were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). SMMC-7721,
MHCC97-H, MHCC97-L and the human immortalized
liver cell line L-02 were obtained from Shanghai Institutes
for Biological Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
HepG2, MHCC-97H and MHCC-97L cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM).
SMMC-7721, SNU-449, SNU-398 and L-02 cell lines were
cultured with RPMI 1640. Both media were supplemented
with fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 10% and
antibiotics at 37ºC with 5% CO2.
Freshly isolated human HCC tissues and paired
normal adjacent tissues were obtained from patients
undergoing surgery at Zhejiang Provincial People’s
Hospital during 2008.08-2010.08 with informed consent
following the protocols approved by the Ethics Committee
of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from HCC cells using
TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For miRNA detection, mature miR-199a-5p or
let-7c was reverse transcribed with specific RT primers,
quantified using a TaqMan probe, and normalized by U6
small nuclear RNA using TaqMan miRNA assays (Assay
ID: 000498, Applied Biosystems, CA). MAP4K3 mRNA
expression was detected using SYBR Green (Perfect
Real Time) (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). Glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used to
normalize the MAP4K3 mRNA expression level.The
sequences of all primers were listed in Supplementary
Table 2. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
using an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems). Data analyses were performed
using the 2−ΔΔCt method.

Cell transfection

let-7c binding sites at the MAP4K3 3′-UTR were amplified
by PCR from HEK-293 cell genomic DNA and cloned
into the XhoI and NotI sites downstream of the luciferase
reporter gene in the pmiR-Check-REPORT vector. Three
mutant constructs were generated using the KOD-Plusmutagenesis kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). All constructs
were verified by DNA sequencing. HepG2 cells were
co-transfected with pmiR MAP4K3-3′-UTR-wt or pmiRMAP4K3-3′-UTR-mut reporters along with either the
miR-199a-5p and let-7c agomirs or negative control in 96well plates using Lipofectamine 2000. Luciferase activity
was measured using the dual luciferase assay system
(Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) 48 h post transfection.
Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control; the
firefly luciferase activity of each sample was normalized
to the activity of Renilla luciferase. The experiment was
performed independently in triplicate.

HepG2, SNU-449, SMMC-7721 or SNU-398
cells were transfected with the miR-199a-5p or let-7c
agomir, the negative control or miRNA inhibitor at a final
concentration of 50 nM in six-well plates according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The miR-199a-5p and let-7c
agomirs, miRNA negative control, miRNA inhibitor
and negative control were synthesized by Ribobio
(Guangzhou, China).

Lentivirus vector
For the construction of miR-199a-5p and let-7c
lentivirus vectors, the pre-miR-199a-5p and pre-let-7c
sequences were ampliﬁed and cloned into GV369-GFP
(System Biosciences, Shanghai, China). The virus
particles were harvested 48 h later. GV369-GFP-199a-7c
was then co-transfected with the packaging plasmids
into HepG2 cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen).

Western blotting
Total protein from the transfected or infected cells
was extracted using standard protocols. The target protein
levels were detected using primary antibodies against
MAP4K3, p-MAP4K3, and GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK). The values of these proteins were normalized for
the corresponding values of GAPDH. Band signals were
acquired in the linear range of the scanner and analyzed
using QUANTITY ONE software (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA).

EDU assay
Cell proliferation was evaluated using the CellLight EdU DNA cell proliferation kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China).

Cell migration and invasion assays
Cellular migration and invasion was assayed
using Transwells (Corning Costar Corp). At 48 h posttransfection, 5 × 104 cells were placed on the top chamber
of each insert with the noncoated membrane for the
migration assay (BD Biosciences, NJ). For the invasion
assay, 1 × 105 cells were added to the upper chamber of
each insert that was coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
NJ).Next, 600 to 800 µl of DMEM or RPMI 1640
containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added into the
lower chambers. After 18 h of incubation at 37°C, the cells
were fixed with 95% absolute alcohol and stained with
0.1% crystal violet. The cells in the inner chamber were
removed, and the cells adhering to the lower membrane
were counted and imaged under an inverted microscope
(Olympus Corp. Tokyo, Japan) at ×200 magnification.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS17.0
software. The results are presented as the mean ± standard
error of at least three independent experiments. P < 0.05 was
regarded as statistically significant and is represented as *.
