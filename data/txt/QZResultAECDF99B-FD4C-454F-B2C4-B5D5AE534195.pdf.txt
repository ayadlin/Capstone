Abstract
There is an unmet need for pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers for antiangiogenic agents. Recent
studies have shown that soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR2), VEGF, and several
other soluble factors may be modulated by VEGF pathway inhibitors. We conducted a broad profiling of cytokine
and angiogenic factors (CAF) to investigate the relationship between baseline CAF levels, CAF changes during
treatment, and tumor shrinkage in early-stage non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with pazopanib, an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-kit. Plasma
samples were collected before treatment and on the last day of therapy from 33 patients with early-stage NSCLC
participating in a single-arm phase II trial. Levels of 31 CAFs were measured by suspension bead multiplex assays
or ELISA and correlated with change in tumor volume. Pazopanib therapy was associated with significant
changes of eight CAFs; sVEGFR2 showed the largest decrease, whereas placental growth factor underwent
the largest increase. Increases were also observed in stromal cell–derived factor-1α, IP-10, cutaneous T-cell–
attracting chemokine, monokine induced by IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand,
and IFN-α. Posttreatment changes in plasma sVEGFR2 and interleukin (IL)-4 significantly correlated with
tumor shrinkage. Baseline levels of 11 CAFs significantly correlated with tumor shrinkage, with IL-12 showing
the strongest association. Using multivariate classification, a baseline CAF signature consisting of hepatocyte
growth factor and IL-12 was associated with tumor response to pazopanib and identified responding patients
with 81% accuracy. These data suggest that CAF profiling may be useful for identifying patients likely to
benefit from pazopanib, and merit further investigation in clinical trials. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2171–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Angiogenesis and the vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) pathway have been recently validated as therapeutic
targets in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with bevacizumab prolonging survival when added to chemotherapy in
patients with advanced disease (1). A growing number of

antiangiogenic, multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), with activity against the VEGF family of receptors,
have shown clinical activity in NSCLC (2–7). These results
raise the possibility that antiangiogenic therapy may benefit
NSCLC patients at earlier stages of their disease, where new
blood vessel formation is critical for tumor growth and metastatic spread, as well as in advanced disease (8).
Tumor angiogenesis is controlled by proangiogenic and
antiangiogenic factors (9) produced by tumor or stromal
cells, inflammatory cells, or other circulating populations.
The efficacy of VEGF inhibitors is likely affected by the balance of these factors, as well as cytokines and chemokines,
through complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment; VEGF pathway blockade, in turn, affects levels of
many of these factors (10–13). Satisfying a growing and unmet need, baseline levels of these cytokine and angiogenic factors (CAF) could therefore be exploited to predict which
patients will derive the most benefit from specific antiangiogenic agents, and the modulation of these CAFs could potentially be used to monitor drug activity, to determine the
optimal antitumor dose, and to help identify possible mechanisms of resistance.
Blood-based biomarkers, including VEGF, soluble VEGF
receptor 2 (sVEGFR2), and circulating endothelial cells, have

been assessed for several different VEGF pathway inhibitors (12, 14–16). Recently, we and others have found that
baseline circulating VEGF levels may be predictive of clinical benefit or tumor response for these agents (17–19). A
limited number of factors have been analyzed in these
studies, however. Multiplex technologies offer a noninvasive and convenient method of simultaneously assessing
a much larger number of biologically relevant CAFs from
small plasma volumes (20, 21). Recently, we and other investigators have tested these methods to investigate CAFs
modulated by treatment with chemotherapy, angiogenesis
inhibitors, or other targeted agents or associated with
therapeutic resistance (21–23). It is unclear whether
changes of any of these factors correlate with tumor response in NSCLC patients treated with TKIs. It is also unknown whether baseline levels of any single factor or
combinations of factors may be predictive of response to
these agents.
To address these questions, we performed an exploratory
CAF analysis in untreated, early-stage NSCLC patients treated with preoperative, single-agent pazopanib. Pazopanib is
an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGFR1, VEGFR2,
VEGFR3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR),
and c-kit, which has recently received approval by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and has previously shown clinical activity
against multiple other tumor types, including ovarian cancer
and sarcoma (24–26).

Materials and Methods
Patients, study design, and overall objectives. Thirty-five
patients participated in this nonrandomized, open-label,
single-arm phase II trial (NCT00367679; VEG105290) conducted in eight sites in the United States, Spain, and Israel.
Patients were to receive oral pazopanib at 800 mg daily for
2 to 6 wk before scheduled surgery followed by a washout
period of 7 d before surgery. No pazopanib dose modifications were planned. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed, resectable, stage I to II (to T2) NSCLC
were included. No prior approved or investigational anticancer therapy within 6 mo before the start of therapy
was permitted. Baseline measurements included tumor assessment by high-resolution computed tomography
(HRCT), tumor biopsy, and plasma sampling for CAF analyses. Tumor volume assessments were conducted by a central reviewer blinded to scan sequence. Volumetric instead
of unidimensional measurements were used for biomarker
correlations because of the high degree of reproducibility
compared with investigator-assessed unidimensional measurements (27–29) and because recent data suggest that
volumetric measurements could detect treatment-induced
tumor changes earlier than unidimensional measurements
in lung cancer patients (29).
Patients consented to enroll in the trial and for plasma and
tumor sample collection before and after surgery for translational studies.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate tumor
volume reduction assessed by HRCT after preoperative treatment with pazopanib. Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety and tolerability of pazopanib (800 mg oncedaily monotherapy). The analyses of CAF profiles in plasma
and transcriptional profiles in tumor tissue were explorative
objectives of this study.
Plasma preparation and measurements. Plasma samples
with EDTA were collected at baseline and on the last day of
pazopanib dosing. Samples were centrifuged at 1,100 × g
(relative centrifugal force) for 15 min at 4°C for separation
of plasma and mononuclear cell layers. Plasma was stored
at −70°C. Before analysis, samples were thawed overnight
at 4°C and centrifuged at 1,500 × g to remove debris.
CAFs were analyzed with commercially available multiplexed bead suspension arrays (MBA). MBA kits were used
as per the manufacturer's instructions using a BioPlex 200
machine (Bio-Rad) in the Thoracic Blood-Based Biomarkers
Laboratory at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The human
group I, 27-plex cytokine panel (Bio-Rad) and human group
II, 23-plex cytokine panel (Bio-Rad) were used. Placental
growth factor (PlGF), VEGF, and sVEGFR2 concentrations
were determined by ELISA (R&D Systems). Analytes for
which >25% of patients had nondetectable levels were not
included in the subsequent analyses.
Statistical methods. CAF analytes that were significantly
changed from baseline following treatment were determined using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Spearman's rank correlation test was used to determine
CAF analytes that were significantly correlated with volumetric shrinkage. This test was also used to determine
an association at baseline between CAF analytes and tumor shrinkage. Hierarchical clustering of the CAF change
data was done using Ward's algorithm (implemented in
Spotfire v8.2.1). CAF log ratios (posttreatment divided by
pretreatment) were mean centered and unit variance
scaled. To understand whether the patient clustering was
related to tumor response, volumetric shrinkage was added
as an extra variable in the clustering analysis. Euclidean
distance was used as similarity measure for clustering,
and profiles were ordered by average value. Multivariate
classification was used to distinguish “responders” from
“nonresponders” using baseline CAF profiles. To maximize
the information from this small data set, patients were divided in two equally sized groups and responders were defined as patients whose volumetric tumor shrinkage was
greater than the median shrinkage of 17% over all patients.
The CAF data were mean centered and unit variance
scaled. Univariate feature selection was done using t test,
requiring at least 1.5-fold change between the two groups.
Class prediction was performed using the nearest centroid
method. To avoid overfitting of the data, leave-one-out
cross-validation was used to determine the smallest number of CAF profiles that maximized overall prediction accuracy. Feature selection and class prediction were
properly embedded within the cross-validation loop to
avoid any selection bias. Class label permutations were
done to assess classifier significance.

CAF Profiling Predicts Response to Pazopanib in NSCLC

Figure 1. Tumor volume changes
after treatment with pazopanib.
Thirty patients (85.7%) achieved a
reduction in tumor volume after
pazopanib treatment. Tumor
volume changes ranged from
−86% to +17%.

Results
Patients. Details of the clinical trial results and analysis of
paired tumor specimens are described in a separate article
(30).5 The average duration of treatment was 16 days (ranging from 3 to 29 days). Thirty-three of 35 early-stage NSCLC
patients had pretreatment and posttreatment plasma samples available for CAF analysis. The median age was 65 years
(range, 51–79), of which 62% were female. Histologies included adenocarcinoma (63%), undifferentiated adenocarcinoma
(3%), undifferentiated carcinoma (6%), squamous cell carcinoma (11%), and other NSCLCs (17%). Stage IA included 19
patients, stage IB included 14 patients, stage IIA included 1
patient, and stage IIB included 1 patient. Thirty patients
(86%) had a reduction in tumor volume after pazopanib
treatment. Tumor changes ranged from −86% to +17%
(Fig. 1). Three patients had a partial response according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.
Baseline CAF levels as predictors of tumor response. We
hypothesized that a broad profile of circulating factors
known to affect angiogenesis, tumor-associated inflammatory cells, or other aspects of the tumor microenvironment (16,
19, 22, 23, 31–34) would be useful for identifying candidate
markers of activity and baseline (pretreatment) markers of
response and resistance. A total of 31 analytes were used
in the final analysis as summarized in Table 1. These included proangiogenic [e.g., VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), PDGF, PlGF, and stromal cell–derived factor-1α
(SDF-1α)] and antiangiogenic factors (e.g., IFN-α2 and IFNγ), interleukins (IL), chemokines involved in myelomonocytic

cell mobilization or recruitment [e.g., granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), MIP-1β, and
GRO-α], and markers of endothelial function or damage
(sVEGFR2). Note that several known angiogenic factors, such
as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), were assessed but
were not detectable in >25% of patients and were therefore
excluded from the analysis.
Baseline levels of 11 CAFs were statistically significantly
correlated with tumor response. These included IL-12, HGF,
IL-16, IP-10, SDF-1α, IL-2Rα, IL-3, IFN-α2, tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), M-CSF,
and PlGF (Table 2). Higher levels of these factors correlated
with better tumor response. Baseline levels of VEGF were
not associated with tumor response. The strongest association was observed with baseline IL-12 and tumor response
(Fig. 2A). IL-12 levels did not seem to be modulated by
treatment.
CAF signature associated with response. To determine
whether combining markers added value to the predictive
ability of individual markers, we analyzed the baseline CAF
levels using multivariate classification techniques. The optimal number of CAF analytes was determined to be two via
cross-validation, and class label permutations showed this
model to be significant (P = 0.003 in 1,000 permutations).
Cross-validation results revealed the ability of the model to
predict 13 of 16 responders and 14 of 17 nonresponders according to the rule described earlier, and the model was able
to classify patients into responders and nonresponders with
an accuracy of 81% (27 of 33 correct predictions). In a final
model training step, all the available data (without leaving
out any patients) were used to build the classification model
and select the top 2 analytes: IL-12 and HGF. Classification
results using these two analytes and all the available data are
shown in Fig. 2B.

CAFs modulated during treatment with pazopanib.
Analysis of CAF levels after treatment revealed eight analytes
that were changed significantly during treatment. These included a decrease in sVEGFR2 and an increase in PlGF, IP-10
(CXCL10), cutaneous T-cell–attracting chemokine (CTACK),
SDF-1α, monokine induced by IFN-γ (MIG; CXCL9), TRAIL,
and IFN-α, all with a Wilcoxon P value of <0.05 (Table 1; Fig.
3A and B). Changes in VEGF levels were not statistically significant (Table 1). PlGF, on the other hand, showed both the
maximal and the most significant increase in response to
treatment with pazopanib (Fig. 3B).
Modulated CAFs as markers of tumor response.
sVEGFR2 and PlGF both showed pronounced changes after
pazopanib treatment (Fig. 3A and B). However, analysis of
CAF changes in relation to tumor shrinkage identified only
sVEGFR2 as a potentially useful marker of tumor response.
That is, greater decreases in sVEGFR2 correlated with larger
tumor shrinkages as shown in Fig. 4A. Increase in IL-4 levels
also correlated with tumor response (Fig. 4B). VEGF changes
from baseline were insignificant and did not correlate with
tumor volume changes. Interestingly, although PlGF had
the largest modulation with treatment, those changes did
not correlate with tumor shrinkage, suggesting that it may
be a pharmacodynamic marker but not a marker of tumor
response.
Hierarchical clustering analysis of CAF changes. Hierarchical clustering analysis results are shown as a heat map in
Fig. 3C. Each row represents a patient, and each column a
CAF analyte or volumetric shrinkage. Red color indicates
the largest changes in CAF levels after treatment and green
color denotes smallest changes. For example, in the case of a
CAF analyte that increased for every patient following treatment, the smallest increases will be green and the largest increases will be red. Clustering analysis revealed three major
patient groups: those in the top few rows of the heat map
who experienced mostly large changes (in red) in multiple
analytes, those in the bottom few rows of the heat map

who experienced mostly smaller changes (in green), and patients in the middle that experienced more variable changes
in baseline CAF levels. Because the tumor volume change
variable in the heat map does not follow the pattern described above, the arrangement of patients in the heat map
does not seem to be related to response. We explored other
patient characteristics (age, gender, race, and initial tumor
volume). However, none was significantly correlated with
the order of patients in the heat map.

Discussion
In cancer patients treated with antiangiogenic TKIs, the
ability to noninvasively measure the baseline and modulated
levels of multiple circulating CAFs could help satisfy an unmet need for biomarkers of drug activity and efficacy. Prior
clinical studies have focused on only single or few markers,
and multiple CAF measurements have mostly been explored
with non–TKI-based therapies (20, 21). Recent preclinical
and clinical studies, however, have suggested that multiple
circulating factors are modulated by VEGF inhibitors given
as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy and
could potentially serve as markers of activity (13, 16, 22,
23). The aim of this study was to explore which factors and
to what extent they are modulated by the novel antiangiogenic TKI, pazopanib, and to identify possible predictive
and early response markers. The primary findings of this
study are that, first, baseline levels of 11 different markers
associated with tumor response were identified. Second, we
show that combining the baseline levels of two factors (HGF
and IL-12) identified patients likely to benefit from preoperative pazopanib treatment. Third, pazopanib therapy results

in the modulation of multiple plasma CAFs, with PlGF showing a striking rise from baseline. Finally, plasma sVEGFR2 not
only decreased during therapy but also correlated with tumor shrinkage. This study identifies several plasma markers
associated with tumor shrinkage and indicates that combinations of these may have greater predictive value.
In patients receiving pazopanib, we observed a decrease in
sVEGFR2 and an increase in PlGF, IP-10 (CXCL10), CTACK,
SDF-1α, MIG (CXCL9), TRAIL, and IFN-α. This is consistent
with previous preclinical findings that show a decrease in
sVEGFR2 and elevation in PlGF and SDF-1α following treatment with another VEGFR/PDGFR inhibitor, sunitinib (13).
These changes were reported in clinical studies to reverse
with discontinuation of sunitinib when used in an intermittent dosing schedule (12). Interestingly, the levels did not
seem to change as a result of tumor hypoxic changes as previously thought but were mostly systemically derived (10).
This may be particularly relevant for our clinical study where
the tumors were localized and small in size. The mechanism
for the decrease in sVEGFR2 has not been established, but
preclinical studies suggest that VEGF-A stimulates shedding
of VEGFR2 from endothelium by VEGFR2-dependent activation of the metalloproteinase ADAM-17 (35). The correlation
between larger decreases in sVEGFR2 and a greater degree of
tumor shrinkage may therefore reflect that more effective
VEGFR2 inhibition results in greater inhibition of receptor
shedding. The mechanism(s) underlying the weaker association between shrinkage and IL-4 changes is less clear because
a greater degree of tumor shrinkage was associated with
smaller changes in IL-4 (Fig. 4B) and IL-4 has been shown
to have both proangiogenic and antiangiogenic effects under
different conditions (36–38).

In the clinical setting, a rise in VEGF and a decrease in
sVEGFR2 have been reported in multiple tumor types and
with several antiangiogenic TKIs (12, 23, 39–42). The majority
of these studies investigated VEGF and sVEGFR2 as potential
biomarkers. We have also conducted a similar CAF analysis
to the one presented here, with the use of vandetanib monotherapy and/or chemotherapy in patients with advanced
NSCLC (23), which showed a decrease in sVEGFR2 and an
increase in VEGF as well as IL-8 and IL-17 in the vandetanib

monotherapy arm. In all these studies, a consistent pattern of
VEGF elevation and sVEGFR2 decrease was observed, suggesting a class effect for antiangiogenic TKI therapies. As discussed below, the molecular mechanisms of these VEGF and
sVEGFR2 changes are currently under investigation (13). Our
study extends these earlier findings in identifying several new
potential pharmacodynamic markers and in showing that
changes in several, but not all, of these markers correlate
with tumor shrinkage.

CAF Profiling Predicts Response to Pazopanib in NSCLC

Figure 4. Changes in plasma levels of (A) sVEGFR2 and (B) IL-4 (represented by the log of posttreatment to pretreatment ratio) are correlated with tumor
shrinkage. Increase in sVEGFR2 (r = 0.41, P = 0.017) and decrease in IL-4 (r = −0.37, P = 0.033) are associated with greater tumor shrinkage.

The marker that changed most dramatically during pazopanib treatment was PlGF. PlGF initiates endothelial proliferation, migration, and mobilization of angiocompetent
bone marrow progenitors. Plasma PlGF levels have been
shown to increase with the use of antiangiogenic treatments
(16, 31, 40, 43). Specifically, patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with cediranib had rises in PlGF plasma levels
(as well as increases in VEGF and decreases in sVEGFR2; ref.
16). Among patients who experienced tumor progression
during treatment, increases in tumor volume were associated with decreases in PlGF levels (as well as increases in SDF1α, bFGF, and sVEGFR). Because of its potential role in
mediating resistance to antiangiogenic therapies, anti-PlGF
therapy is now being pursued as a novel antiangiogenic
agent (44).
Unlike PlGF or VEGF, a decrease of soluble levels of
VEGFR2 was found to correlate with tumor volume decrease.
Previously, in nontumor-bearing mice treated with sunitinib,
sVEGFR2 decreased and correlated with the optimal dose for
antitumor response (13). Consistent with the findings in the
results of the present study, a recent phase I study of the
VEGFR TKI AMG706 showed a rise in PlGF and a decrease
in sVEGFR2 during treatment; in that study, however, both
changes correlated with a decrease in tumor size (43). Taken
together, our data and these earlier studies suggest that
sVEGFR2 may be a distinct marker for drug exposure and
early tumor response. It is worth noting that all patients in
the study had early-stage disease, and the duration of treatment was short (mean, 16 days). It is not possible to determine whether sVEGFR2 changes would continue to be
associated with tumor response in the setting of advanced
disease or after prolonged treatment. These issues merit further investigation in subsequent studies.

We separately investigated baseline levels of CAFs in relation to tumor shrinkage and found 11 factors that could
serve as potential predictive markers, with higher levels of
these factors correlating with better tumor response. Baseline levels of IL-12 followed by HGF had the best correlation
with tumor response and could potentially serve as an important predictive marker in future studies. IL-12 is a master
regulator of TH1 immune responses and a known angiogenesis inhibitor. To our knowledge, this is the first report of circulating IL-12 as a predictor of response in patients receiving
an antiangiogenic TKI. HGF and its receptor, the MET tyrosine kinase, mediate neoplastic invasive growth and have
been the cause of many other biological events, including cell
proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis (45). By multivariate classification, we derived a two-factor signature that may
identify patients likely to benefit from pazopanib treatment.
As a final step in our analysis, we performed an exploratory hierarchical clustering analysis of CAF level changes before and after treatment for individual patients. This
analysis showed that, for a given patient, changes in many
of the factors were highly correlated with one another. Although the absolute magnitude of these changes varied between the CAFs, it suggests that groups of these factors
undergo coordinated changes, suggesting that a common
mechanism or pathway may be regulating them. Three major
clusters of patients were identified, with one group having
relatively large changes across most CAFs, another having
smaller changes, and the third with mixed results. The factors regulating these changes are under investigation, but
preclinical studies suggest that they are affected by both
the tumor and the host (13).
In brief, our exploratory analysis revealed multiple CAFs
modulated with preoperative pazopanib treatment. PlGF

showed a striking rise from baseline and is a potential pharmacodynamic marker. sVEGFR2 decrease and IL-4 increase
from baseline were associated with tumor response, and
multiple other potentially predictive markers were identified,
several of which have not been previously reported. Lastly,
our finding that a combination of baseline levels of plasma
factors was associated with tumor shrinkage shows the utility and feasibility of such an approach and merits further investigation in future clinical trials.
