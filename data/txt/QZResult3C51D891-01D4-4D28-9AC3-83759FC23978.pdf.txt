BACKGROUND. The current study was conducted to asses the safety profile and
clinical activity of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in patients with recurrent follicular lymphoma (FL).

METHODS. This study was a noncomparative, multicenter, phase II study.
Between March 2000 and December 2002, 54 patients with recurrent FL were enrolled in the FCþR trial. Patients received fludarabine at a dose of 25 mg/m2 and
cyclophosphamide at a dose of 300 mg/m2 daily for 3 consecutive days, every
3 weeks for 4 cycles. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 beginning 2 weeks after the first course of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and
then on Day 1 of each cycle thereafter. The planned treatment duration was 10
weeks.

RESULTS. Overall, 92% of patients completed the planned therapy in 10 to 14
weeks and 74% achieved a complete response (CR). Among patients with BCL2-

median survival from treatment (SFT), the duration of disease remission (DR),
low-up of 45 months. Of the baseline characteristics, >2 previous treatments,
BCL2-positive bone marrow, and low Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score were found to be associated with better DR and/or
TTP. Hematologic toxicity was transient and reversible, with the exception of 3
patients with severe and prolonged neutropenia. Three patients presented with
infections, 1 of whom died of bronchopneumonia.

CONCLUSIONS. The FCþR scheme, a nonanthracycline-containing regimen lasting
up to 10 weeks, was found to be relatively well-tolerated and demonstrated significant antilymphoma activity with excellent clinical CR and molecular response
rates. Cancer 2007;110:121–8.  2007 American Cancer Society.

characterized by a high initial response rate to chemotherapy followed invariably by disease recurrence,
with subsequent remissions of progressively shorter
duration.2,3 The majority of patients eventually die of
their disease. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is often characterized by the t(14;18) translocation, in which the
BCL2 protooncogene on chromosome 18 is translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH)
region on chromosome 14, creating a hybrid BCL2/
IgH gene.4 This translocation results in the overexpression and activation of BCL2 and a subsequent
inhibition of apoptosis.
To our knowledge, to date there is no gold standard for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent advanced FL. Until a few years
ago, the management of FL was basically palliative
and little therapeutic progress appears to have been
made within the last 30 years.2
A large majority of FL patients initially respond
to alkylating agent-based combination chemotherapy.5 The use of purine analogues6 and combination
regimens containing anthracyclines7 may increase
the rate of complete response (CR). Adding interferon in the context of relatively intensive initial
chemotherapy may prolong overall survival,8 but
many patients are unable to tolerate the accompanying side effects.9 The results of a recent study suggested that the combination of cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab (CHOPþR) may prolong the duration of disease
remission (DR).10 Although the results of recent retrospective studies9,11 suggest that new treatment
options, including the incorporation of rituximab,
have made significant stepwise improvements in
patient outcome, to our knowledge it has not been
shown conclusively that these treatment modalities
improve survival in FL patients.
New treatment approaches for FL currently
under investigation include attempts to eradicate the
disease using high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation, and testing new drugs
or biologic therapies. Among these, the use of antiCD20 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) appears to be
the most useful approach. The chimeric anti-CD20
MoAb rituximab has been shown to be a highly
effective agent in the treatment of FL, either alone12
or in combination with chemotherapy9–11,13 or other
biologic agents.14 The ability of rituximab to sensitize
indolent lymphoma-derived cell lines to cytotoxic
chemotherapy agents has been demonstrated previously.15,16 Furthermore, chemotherapeutic agents
such as fludarabine also may sensitize cells to the
effects of rituximab.17 Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine have shown synergistic activity in B-cell

chronic lymphocytic leukemia in vitro.18 In view of
the single-agent activity and demonstrated synergy
between cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and
between fludarabine and rituximab, we evaluated the
combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
plus rituximab (FCþR) in previously treated patients
with advanced FL. The primary objective of the current study was to assess the safety profile and clinical activity of the FCþR combination. The secondary
goal was to evaluate the ability of the treatment to
convert bone marrow BCL2 positivity such that
patients achieved molecular disease remissions
(MRs).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Entry Criteria
This study was conducted at 10 Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi (GISL) sites in Italy between March 2000
and December 2002; a total of 54 patients were enrolled in this trial. Ten patients, 25 patients, and 19
patients were enrolled during 2000, 2001, and 2002,
respectively. Eligible patients had histologically documented World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1–
21, CD20-positive, recurrent FL. Patients were required to have an Ann Arbor stage III or IV disease.
Patients with stage II disease were eligible if they presented with B symptoms or bulky disease. Patients
were further required to have a need for therapy in
the opinion of the treating clinician, measurable disease, an expected survival of 6 months, to be aged
18 to 70 years, to have undergone <3 lines of chemotherapy, and to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection; hepatitis B or C virus; central nervous
system (CNS) lymphoma; previous malignancies; or
cardiac, renal, hepatic, or respiratory failure were
excluded. Pregnant or lactating women and patients
of childbearing potential were not eligible for the current study, unless birth control measures were used.
The study complied with all requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki and its current amendments, and
was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical
Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by
the institutional review board at each participating
center. Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients.
Study Design and Treatment Schedule
This was an open-label, noncomparative, multicenter, phase II study. The dose and schedule of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and
cyclophosphamide (FCþR) is illustrated in Figure 1.

FC1R in Follicular Lymphoma/Sacchi et al.

FIGURE 1. Dosing schedule of the regimen of rituximab in combination
with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.
Briefly, patients received FCþR chemoimmunotherapy, comprised of fludarabine at a dose of 25 mg/m2
and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 300 mg/m2 daily
for 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.
Rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 was administered
by infusion beginning 2 weeks after the first course
of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to reduce the
risk of cytokine release syndrome, and was then
administered on Day 1 of each cycle thereafter.
Treatment was planned for 10 weeks. Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), acyclovir prophylaxis, and granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) support were allowed at the discretion of
the treating physician. Concurrent treatment with
corticosteroids was not permitted.

Patient Evaluation, Follow-up and Response Criteria
Pretreatment and response evaluation included medical history; physical examination; complete blood
counts; serum chemistry profile; computed tomography (CT) scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and bone marrow biopsy and aspirate to assess
the extent of disease and BCL2 rearrangement. Analysis of the molecular BCL2/IgH chimeric gene rearrangement was performed using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) according to a previously published
method.19
During the follow-up physical examination, laboratory parameters and CT scans were performed every 6 months until disease recurrence or progression.
Response to therapy was evaluated 6 to 8 weeks after
the completion of treatment. Clinical response
(including CR, unconfirmed CR, partial response
[PR], stable disease, and progressive disease) were
defined according to International Working Group
recommendations.20 The frequency and severity of
side effects were recorded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCICTC) (version 1).21

Statistical Analysis
A total of 54 patients entered this protocol and the
intent-to-treat population included all enrolled
patients. Survival from treatment (SFT) was defined
as the time from the date of the first cycle of FCþR
to the date of the last follow-up examination or the
date of death from any cause. Duration remission
(DR) was defined as the time from the date of CR or
PR after the completion of FCþR cycles to the date
of disease progression or the date of the last followup examination. Time to disease progression (TTP)
was defined as the time from the date of the first
FCþR cycle to the date of documented disease progression or death from non-Hodgkin lymphoma or
the date of the last follow-up examination. Overall
survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date
of first treatment after the diagnosis of FL to the date
of last follow-up examination or the date of death
from any cause. Survival analysis was calculated
using the Kaplan-Meier method 22 and statistical
comparisons between the baseline characteristics of
the patients and survival estimates were made using
the log-rank test.23 Chi-square analysis, when appropriate, and the Fisher exact test were used to evaluate differences between baseline characteristics of
the patients, in categorized form, and clinical
response and toxicity related to treatment. For continuous variables, the Mann-Whitney U test was
used.24 In all analyses, a 2-sided P value <.05 was
considered to demonstrate a moderate strength of
evidence against the null hypothesis. However, this
level of probability was helpful to detect clinically
significant variables. The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI)25 was calculated
for 46 of the 54 patients (85%).

RESULTS
Demographics
The clinical characteristics of the 54 patients at baseline are summarized in Table 1. The median age of the
patients was 62 years (range, 44-79 years) and 59% of
the patients were female. All patients were pretreated
and 20% had received 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Prior chemotherapy included CHOP, CHOPlike, and anthracycline plus fludarabine-containing
regimens.26 Thirteen patients (24%) had received previous treatment with fludarabine, 4 patients (7%) had
been treated previously with rituximab, and no
patients had received combination treatment with
chemotherapy plus rituximab. Three patients had
undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. The
majority of patients (81%) had advanced disease (stage
III and stage IV). The FLIPI score was >2 in 35% of the

Efficacy
Overall, 49 (92%) of the 53 patients who began treatment completed all planned therapy in 10 to 14
weeks. Treatment was discontinued for 4 patients for
the following reasons: severe and prolonged neutropenia in 3 patients (after 3 cycles in 2 patients and
after 2 cycles in 1 patient) and progressive disease in
1 patient (occurring after 2 cycles). The overall
response rate for all 54 patients in the intent-to-treat
analysis was 90%, and 40 patients (74%) obtained a

and 1 patient (2%) refused to begin therapy immediately after giving written informed consent (Table 2).
A univariate analysis of baseline prognostic factors
(age, sex, stage of disease, lymph node sites, hemoglobin level, lactate dehydrogenase level, FLIPI score,
number of previous treatments, previous treatment
with fludarabine or rituximab, BCL2-positive bone
marrow involvement, and enlarged spleen) found
that none of these factors were predictive of response
to treatment.
At the time of last follow-up, 14 patients had
died (Table 3). Forty patients were still alive, 31 with
ongoing responses and 9 with progressive disease.
The median SFT, DR, and TTP had not been reached
after a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 1-74
months). Figure 2 shows the SFT, DR, and TTP
curves. The associations between clinical characteristics versus SFT, DR, and TTP are summarized in Table 4.
The probability of SFT at 4 years was 75% (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 60-85%). None of the
baseline prognostic characteristics was found to be
significantly correlated with SFT. The 4-year DR rate
in the 49 patients who achieved a CR or PR was 63%
(95%CI,47-75%). Among the baseline prognostic
characteristics, <2 previous treatments was found to
be significantly (P ¼ .03) correlated with a better DR
and a trend was noted in patients who were positive
for BCL2 (P ¼ .08). The 4-year TTP rate in all 54
patients was 61% (95% CI , 46-73%). BCL2 positivity
and having received <2 previous treatments were
found to be correlated with better TTP (P ¼ .02 and
P ¼ .04, respectively), confirming the trend observed
for DR. A trend toward better TTP also was observed
in patients with a FLIPI score <2 (P ¼ .06).Overall
survival at 8 years was 78% (95% CI,63-88%). Figure
2 shows the overall survival curve.

Toxicity
Toxicity was evaluable in 52 patients. Typical firstdose rituximab infusion toxicity was observed in the
current study patients, as previously described. 14
Fludarabine was found to be well-tolerated. The
most commonly noted severe side effects were hematologic and included 21 cases of neutropenia, 3

cases of thrombocytopenia, and 2 cases of anemia
(Table 5). Overall, the hematologic toxicities were
transient and reversible. Treatment delays of 1 to 3
weeks were necessary in 12 patients. However, 3
patients were taken off therapy for severe and prolonged neutropenia. These 3 patients presented with
WHO grade 3/4 infections. Two patients recovered
within 2 to 5 weeks. One patient died of bronchopneumonia 13 weeks after protocol entry. One patient

We observed a significant association between >4
lymph node sites (P ¼ .01), BCL2-positive bone marrow (P ¼ .007), and female sex (P ¼ .01) with the risk
of presenting with WHO grade 3/4 neutropenia. Age,
FLIPI score, and the number of previous treatments
were not found to be associated with the grade of
neutropenia observed. Only 1 patient presented with
WHO grade 2 herpes zoster infection. Overall, 15
patients received G-CSF support. Prophylaxis with
TMP-SMX and acyclovir was used in 10 patients and
2 patients, respectively.

DISCUSSION
The treatment of patients with FL remains a matter
of controversy, and treatment choices may vary radi-

cally from a watch-and-wait policy to high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
However, to our knowledge, none of these options
has demonstrated the potential to cure FL patients.
Several treatment options are available for patients
with recurrent disease, making it challenging for the
treating physician to choose the best treatment.
Because to our knowledge no optimal therapy has
been identified to date, the characteristics of patients
with recurrent disease, the type of previous treatment, the duration of previous response, age, comorbidities, and the expanding role of MoAb treatment
(ie, rituximab maintenance and radiommunotherapy)
must be taken into consideration during the decision-making process for the treatment of each individual patient.
A recent randomized trial compared fludarabine
with the combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) in patients with recurrent
FL.27 Compared with CVP, fludarabine significantly
improved progression-free survival, treatment-free
survival, and social functioning scores.27 Combining
fludarabine with cyclophosphamide and/or mitoxantrone could increase the efficacy of fludarabine to
improve response and failure-free survival.28,29 Early
phase II studies10 and recent randomized trials have
demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to the
CHOP regimen30,31 or to other anthracycline-containing32–34 or nonanthracycline-containing regimens35
resulted in higher CR rates and better progressionfree survival rates. The rationale behind our decision
to utilize the FCþR combination was the observed in
vitro synergism between fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, the ability of rituximab to sensitize lymphoma cells to fludarabine, and the ability of
fludarabine to synergize with rituximab. We also considered the single-agent activity of cyclophospha-

FC1R in Follicular Lymphoma/Sacchi et al.

mide, fludarabine, and rituximab in the treatment of
FL, and the high efficacy of the FCþR combination
in the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.36
Because of the high number of older patients
with comorbidities, a nonanthracycline-containing
immunochemotherapy regimen would be a valid alternative treatment, especially in patients who were
previously treated with CHOP. Although the use of
fludarabine is associated with significant immunosuppression,37 our short-duration FCþR scheme
(only 10 weeks) could be a valuable addition to current therapeutic options because anthracycline treatment is limited by the cardiotoxicity associated with
the cumulative dose. The results of the current study
are encouraging and compare favorably in terms of
efficacy and safety with those obtained with 6 cycles
of CHOPþR in a similar subset of patients with
recurrent FL.31 Furthermore, the current study results
are similar, in terms of efficacy, to those obtained in
a longer-duration scheme of fludarabine plus rituximab conducted in chemotherapy-naive and recurrent
FL patients.13 When evaluating the results of the current study, it is interesting to note that no patients
with refractory FL were enrolled in this trial; 80%
were in first disease recurrence, and 19% had stage II
disease with B symptoms or bulky disease.
Approximately 89% of the patients enrolled in
the current study completed all planned therapy in
10 to 14 weeks, and 74% of patients achieved a CR.
At the time of last follow-up, the median SFT, DR,
and TTP had not been reached after a median of 45
months, and 86% of tested patients converted to
BCL2-negative bone marrow. Statistical analysis of
baseline characteristics versus DR and TTP demonstrated that <2 previous treatments, BCL2-positive
bone marrow, and low FLIPI score were correlated
with better survival outcomes. Overall, hematologic
toxicity was found to be reversible and a short treatment delay due to neutropenia was necessary in only
12 patients. Surprisingly, age, FLIPI score, and the
number of previous treatments were not found to be
associated with the grade of neutropenia. The 3
patients in whom treatment had to be discontinued
because of prolonged neutropenia presented with
grade 3/4 infections. However, 2 of the 3 patients
recovered within 2 to 5 weeks.
In conclusion, the results of the current study
demonstrated that the immunotherapy scheme of
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide plus rituximab
had high antitumor activity, with 74% of patients
achieving CRs and 89% achieving BCL2 clearance.
Treatment could be administered in <3 months, and
the median SFT, DR, and TTP were not reached after

127

a mean follow-up of 45 months. This treatment
appears to be relatively safe, and complications from
infection appeared to be a relatively rare event, despite approximately 40% of patients presenting with
severe neutropenia. The current study results
demonstrated that this short regimen is a possible
treatment option for patients with recurrent FL and
could constitute 1 treatment arm of a randomized
trial. Based on the observed incidences of neutropenia, which resulted in a treatment delay in 12
patients, this scheme could be modified by cycling
every 28 days instead of 21 days. Furthermore, considering the expanding role of rituximab as a maintenance therapy after induction treatment, the FCþR
regimen could be followed by rituximab infusion every 2 to 3 months for 1 to 2 years.
