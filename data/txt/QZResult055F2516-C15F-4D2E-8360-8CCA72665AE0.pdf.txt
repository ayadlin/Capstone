ABSTRACT
Purpose: To establish accurate prognostic score models to predict survival for
patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), treated with intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy. Materials and methods: Six hundred and
seventy-five patients with newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic and histologically proven
NPC who were treated with IMRT and chemotherapy were analyzed retrospectively.
Samples were split randomly into a training set (n = 338) and a test set (n = 337)
to analyze. All data from the training set were used to perform an extensive survival
analysis and to develop multivariate nomograms based on Cox regression. Data from
the test set was used as an external validation set. Risk group stratification was
proposed for the nomograms. Results: The nomograms are able to predict survival
with a C-index for external validation of local recurrence-free survival (LRFS; 0.66,
95% CI: 0.58-0.74), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; 0.73, 95% CI: 0.66-0.79),
and disease-specific survival (DSS; 0.73, 95% CI: 0.67-0.79). The calibration curve
for probability of survival showed good agreement between prediction by nomogram
and actual observation. The C-index of the nomogram for LRFS, DMFS and DSS were
statistically higher than the C-index values of the AJCC seventh edition (P < 0.001).
In the test set, the nomogram discrimination was also superior to the AJCC Staging
systems (P < 0.001). The stratification in risk groups allows significant distinction
between Kaplan-Meier curves for outcome. Conclusions: Prognostic score models were
successfully established and validated to predict LRFS, DMFS, and DSS over a 5-year
period after IMRT and chemotherapy, which will be useful for individual treatment.

treatment centers. However, TNM staging system may not
be precise enough to predict prognosis of NPC because
patients with the same TNM stage often have different
prognoses. Various prognostic factors, such as lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) level in serum, body mass index
(BMI), hemoglobin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)

The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system
for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) plays an important
role in predicting prognosis, facilitating treatment

and primary gross tumor volume (GTV-P), have also been
identified and evaluated retrospectively [1-4].
In the past decades, the diagnostic and treatment
methods for NPC have made great progress. Especially,
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has improved
local control and long-term survival for patients with
NPC compared with two-dimensional conventional
radiotherapy (2D-CRT) [5, 6]. Therefore, it is necessary to
determine whether prognostic factors previously evaluated
for 2D-CRT could also be applied to modern IMRT. More
and more attention has been paid to individual treatment.
That emphasizes the need to build a more accurate and
practical prognostic system for predicting the clinical
outcome of patients treated by IMRT and chemotherapy.
The objective of this study is to establish a convenient
prognostic score models for NPC patients treated with
IMRT and chemotherapy.

Patterns of treatment failure and survival for the
whole cohort
A total of 68 (10.1%) patients developed disease
recurrence, 114 (16.9%) developed distant metastases
and 136 (20.1%) died. A total of 136 patients died,
among which 105 died of distant metastasis, 31 died of
locoregional relapse, 3 died of other cancer, 2 died of
intercurrent disease, 3 died of cardiovascular events, 2
died from car accident, and 4 died of unknown causes. The
5-year survival rates were as follows: local recurrence-free
survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS),
disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival
(DSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 92.3%, 83.6%,
76.4%, 85.1% and 83.7% , respectively.

by nomogram and actual observation (Figure 2).

Comparison of predictive accuracy for LRFS,
DMFS and DSS between nomogram and the
AJCC staging systems

The median follow-up time was 70 months (range,
6 to 116 months). The 5-year LRFS, DMFS and DSS
rates were 93.3%, 84.5% and 85.7%, respectively. The
results of the Kaplan-Meier analyses are listed in Table
2. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that age, LDH,
N2 classification, N3 classification and GTV-P have
a significant impact on DSS time. GTV-P was the only
one independent prognostic factor for LRFS. LDH,
N2 classification, N3 classification and GTV-P affect
significantly DMFS (Table 3).

The nomogram showed better accuracy in predicting
LRFS, DMFS and DSS in the training set. The C-index
of the nomogram for LRFS was much higher than that
of T stage of the 7th edition of the AJCC staging system
(0.65, 95% CI: 0.58-0.74 vs. 0.60, 95% CI: 0.54-0.66, P
< 0.001). The C-index of the nomogram for DMFS was
much higher than that of N stage of the 7th edition of
the AJCC staging system (0.76, 95% CI: 0.65-0.86 vs.
0.70, 95% CI: 0.61-0.80, P < 0.001). The C-index of the
nomogram for DSS was much higher than that of the 7th
edition of the AJCC staging system (0.76, 95% CI: 0.700.81 vs. 0.66, 95% CI: 0.60-0.73, P < 0.001).

test set displayed statistically different outcomes for the
two proposed risk groups (5-year LRFS: 94.9% for low
risk group; 79.2% for high risk group; P < 0.001, Figure
3a).
By splitting the training set into four subgroups with
different quartiles of the risk score for DMFS, we have
identified a high- and low-risk group. No differences,
however, were found between the other two groups; thus,
we merged these groups on patient group with a low risk
score. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the DMFS rate for the
test set displayed statistically different outcomes for the
three proposed risk groups (5-year DMFS: 91.4% for low
risk group; 81.1% for medium risk group; 66.3% for high
risk group; P < 0.001, Figure 3b).
By splitting the training set into four subgroups
with different quartiles of the risk score for DSS, we have
identified a high- and low-risk group. No differences,
however, were found between the other two groups; thus,
we merged these groups on patient group with a low risk
score. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the DSS rate for the test
set displayed statistically different outcomes for the three
proposed risk groups (5-year DSS: 94.6% for low risk
group; 83.1% for medium risk group; 65.1% for high risk
group; P < 0.001, Figure 3c).

LRFS prediction performed with a C-index of 0.66
(95% CI: 0.56-0.73). For DMFS, the final model’s C-index
was 0.73 (95%CI: 0.66-0.79). The nomogram for DSS had
a C-index of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.68-0.78). These validation
performances are not significantly lower than the
performances on the training set, which makes overfitting
by the model less evident. A calibration curve showed
good agreement between prediction and observation in
the probability of 5-year survival (Figure 2). The C-index
of the AJCC seventh edition for LRFS was significantly
lower than that of the nomogram (0.59, 95% CI: 0.52-0.66,
P < 0.001).The C-index of the AJCC seventh edition for
DMFS was significantly lower than that of the nomogram
(0.67, 95% CI: 0.59-0.73, P < 0.001). The C-index of the
AJCC seventh edition for DSS was significantly lower
than that of the nomogram (0.65, 95% CI: 0.59-0.72, P
< 0.001).

of interest to reevaluate the previous existing prognostic
factors for NPC in the new era of IMRT.

LFRS and significantly improves the prognostic validity
of T classifications in NPC. Wu et al. [12] analyzed the
correlation between GTV-P and prognosis in patients with
NPC undergoing IMRT. Multivariate analysis showed that
only GTV-P had a statistically significant correlation to
local control, whereas T classification was not associated
with LRFS. It concurred closely with our findings that not
T classification but GTV-P significantly had significant
effect on 5-year LRFS in the current study. This indicates
the limitations of the current T staging system, which is
based on anatomic location and cranial nerve involvement
and cannot accurately reflect the tumor bulk.
Benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been
seen in reduction of local failure [13]. The results
from two meta-analysis also showed that the addition
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) to radiation

LRFS prediction
The aim of this study was to develop a nomogram
for LRFS to predict LRFS and select patients for
neoadjuvant chemotherapy to improve local control. The
best model for LRFS was only based on GTV-P.
A retrospective study by Sze et al. [10] suggested
that GTV-P was an independent prognostic factor for
the local failure-rate, and the risk of local failure was
estimated to increase by 1% for every 1 cm3 increase
in primary tumor volume. Guo et al. [11] reported that
only GTV-P was an independent prognostic indicator for

significantly reduced the incidence of locoregional
recurrences, and no significant beneficial effect on the
incidence of locoregional recurrence was found for
adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) [14, 15]. However, no
significant differences in 5-year LRFS were observed
among the three groups (concurrent chemotherapy (CCT),
CCT+NACT, CCT+ACT) in the current series (Table
2). One reasonable explanation is that the patients with
advanced disease were more likely to receive NACT.
So, we can select patients for NACT based on GTV-P.
Although the estimated probabilities by the nomograms
are on a continuous scale, we proposed two risk groups of
local recurrence based on GTV-P which stratified by 48.5
ml(5-year LRFS: 94.9% for low risk group; 79.2% for
high risk group; P < 0.001, Figure 3a). In agreement with
our findings, Wu et al reported that 48 ml was the cutoff
point of GTV-P for local control, and the 5-year local
recurrence-free for patient with GTV-P smaller than 48 ml
and greater than 48ml were 98.0% and 77.9%, respectively
(P < 0.001). So, different treatment strategies could be
followed for the two categories (CCT, NACT+CCT).

distant metastasis, and adjuvant chemotherapy had limited
positive effect on distant metastasis [14, 15]. In contrast,
the combination of neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy
(cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil regimen) and concurrent
chemotherapy had modest effect on the risk of distant
metastasis compared with concurrent chemotherapy
alone (Table 2) in our study. The main reason may be
that it was more likely for patients with advanced disease
to receive neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy. The
nomograms can serve as a guide for clinicians to choose
neoadjuvant chemotherapy considering the risk for distant
metastasis. Although all the patients from the medium
risk and high risk were treated with chemoradiotherapy,
they still had a high incidence of distant metastasis.
Thus, the chemotherapy strategies we have fall short as
treatments for these patients and, with better treatment
outcomes in mind, we need more studies in order to find
a comprehensive approach that works more intensively.
Among other newer agents, taxanes and gemcitabine have
demonstrated results that are promising with neoadjuvant
and palliative chemotherapy in NPC [18, 19]. For the
treatment of advanced NPC, Hui et al did a randomized
phase II trial on the concurrent cisplatin radiotherapy
with neoadjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin or without[20].
The preliminary results demonstrate that neoadjuvant
chemotherapy shows its potential by reducing the distant
metastasis. As a result, newer practice to combine more
tolerable drugs which is likely to enhance the efficiency of
chemotherapy as an adjunct in medium risk and high risk
patients should be investigated. Moreover, the addition
of molecular targeted agents to chemoradiotherapy may
provide a survival benefit for these patients by eradicating
micro-metastases [21, 22].

DMFS prediction
With the use of IMRT, coupled with the wide
adoption of concomitant chemotherapy, the local relapse
rate in NPC has significantly decreased, and distant
metastases has become to be the predominant model of
treatment failures [6], the identification and stratification
of patients at high risk for metastasis could optimize
staging and treatment strategies.
The aim of this study was to develop a nomogram to
predict metastasis rates and select patients for neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. The best model for distant metastasis
resulted in the following factors: LDH, N2 classification,
N3 classification and GTV-P.
Up-regulation of LDH ensures an efficient
anaerobic/glycolytic metabolism while enabling tumor
cells to become independent of an oxygen supply.
Meanwhile, high serum LDH level may reflect a large
tumor burden and high probability of developing clones
resistant to treatment. Consistent with our study, Zhou et
al reported that serum LDH level before treatment was
an adverse prognostic factor for distant metastasis [16].
A retrospective study reported by Wan et al showed that
high pretreatment LDH value was also associated with an
inferior 5-year DMFS [17].
Large tumor volumes usually indicate a high
proliferation rate and malignancy of tumor cells, which
has correlation to distant metastasis. Here, we confirmed
that GTV-P affected significantly DMFS. Consistent to
our present study, previous studies have demonstrated
that GTV-P had a significant effect on distant metastasis
of NPC [11, 12].
Two meta-analysis indicated that neoadjuvant
chemotherapy had a significant impact on reduction of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DSS prediction
Disease-specific survival is more dependent on the
DFMS than LFRS. The most predictive model for DSS
was based on predictors similar to those for DFMS: age,
LDH, N2 classification, N3 classification and GTV-P.
Treatment responses and compliance to treatment
seem to change with age: elderly patients displayed a
worse DSS than younger patients in the present study.
Consistent to our study, Zhou et al.’s [16] and Chang
et al.’s [3] studies revealed that there was a significant
difference in survival between patients younger than 50
years and those older than 50 years.
Consistent to our present study, several groups have
reported that serum LDH level before treatment was an
adverse prognostic factor in NPC [1, 16, 17]. Chen et
al. [23] and Guo et al. [11] reported that GTV-P was an
independent prognostic indicator for overall survival. Wu
et al’ study also indicated that GTV-P had a statistically
significant correlation to overall survival. The previous
studies concurred closely with our findings that GTV-P
was associated with DSS in the current study.

Nomograms have been developed and shown to
be more accurate than the conventional staging systems
for predicting prognosis in some cancers [9, 24]. The
nomograms performed well in predicting survival, and
its prediction was supported by the C-index and the
calibration curve. When compared with the 7th edition of
the AJCC staging systems, the nomogram displayed better
predictive accuracy for DSS in our study.
A prognostic index derived by combining points
for each of these characteristics included age, LDH, N2
classification, N3 classification and GTV-P accurately
separated patients into categories at the low risk, medium
risk and high risk for disease-specific death. Different
treatment strategies could be followed for each of these
categories (radiotherapy alone, concurrent chemotherapy,
and neoadjuvant/adjuvant+concurrent chemotherapy) and
tailored schedule could be randomly tested any category
to test the value of multidrug schedules.

patients in training set and test set are shown in Table 1.
Our study was approved by the ethics committee of our
Cancer Center.

Clinical staging
All patients completed pretreatment evaluations
that included physical examination, hematologic and
biochemistry test, fiberoptic endoscope examination of
the nasopharynx, magnetic resonance imaging of the neck
and nasopharynx, chest radiograph, bone scintigraph, and
ultrasonography of the abdominal region. All NPC cases
were restaged according to the 7th edition of the AJCC
staging system.

Treatment methods
Radiotherapy

The limitations of our study

Target volumes were delineated according to
our institutional treatment protocol, in agreement with
the International Commission on Radiation Units and
Measurements Reports 50 and 62 [7-8]. Planning target
volumes (PTVs) of GTVs and CTVs were generated
automatically by adding a 3-mm margin after delineation
of tumor targets according to the immobilization and
localization uncertainties. Inverse planning was performed
on the Corvus System for all patients using Simultaneous
Modulated Accelerated Radiation Therapy boost RT. The
prescribed dose was 68Gy to the PTV of the GTVnx,
60Gy to the PTV of CTV1 (i.e., high-risk regions), 54Gy
to the PTV of CTV2 (i.e., low-risk regions), and 60-66Gy
to the PTV of the GTVnd for the positive cervical lymph
nodes in 30 fractions.

This study had several limitations. First, the
nomograms were developed based on data obtained
from a single institution in China. Second, although the
prognostic value of pretreatment and post-treatment
plasma Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA levels has been
validated in non-metastatic NPC patients [25, 26], only
15.3% (103/675) patients had plasma EBV DNA copy
number before treatments in this series. It is not available
for us to take EBV DNA into the model analysis. Further
research is merit in future. Third, because no patient had
histology of WHO I type, the model should be applied
with caution in NPC patients with WHO type I disease.

CONCLUSIONS

Chemotherapy
Of the 675 patients, 377 (55.9%) patients received
concomitant chemotherapy. A combination of neoadjuvant
and concomitant chemotherapy was delivered to
267(39.6%) patients, and concomitant and adjuvant
chemotherapy were delivered to 31 (4.5%) patients.
Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of
cisplatin (80mg/m2 IV on day 1) with 5-fluorouracil
(800mg/m2 continuously IV on day 1-5) every three
weeks for two or three cycles. Concurrent chemotherapy
consisted of cisplatin (80mg/m2 IV) given on weeks 1, 4
and 7 of radiotherapy.

Prognostic score models were successfully
established and validated to predict LRFS, DMFS, and
DSS over a 5-year period after IMRT and chemotherapy,
which will be useful for individual treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient characteristic
A total of 675 patients with newly-diagnosed,
nonmetastatic and histologically proven NPC were treated
with IMRT and chemotherapy in our Center from January
2003 to October 2008. The 675 NPC patients were
randomly split into a training set (n = 338) and a test set
(n = 337) by software with ratio of 1:1. A programmer
(Guo Pi), who was blind to the clinical information before
data analyses, performed the computerized randomization
using randomization sequence. The characteristics of

Follow-up and statistical analysis
The follow-up duration was calculated from the first
day of therapy to either the day of death or the day of the
last examination. After the completion of radiotherapy,
all patients were followed up every 1-3months during the
first 2 years, every 6 months in years 2 to 5 and annually
thereafter. The median follow-up period was 70 months
(range: 3-123 months).

All analyses were performed with SPSS software,
version 19.0. Survival curves were depicted using the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank
test. Multivariate analyses with the Cox proportional
hazards model were used to test for independent
significance parameters by backward elimination.
A nomogram was formulated based on the results of
multivariate analysis and by using the package of rms in
R version 2.10.1. A final model selection was performed
by a forward step-down selection process with the Akaike
information criterion. The performance of the nomogram
was measured by concordance index (C-index) and
assessed by comparing nomogram-predicted versus
observed Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probability.
Comparison between the nomogram and the seventh
edition of the AJCC staging system was performed with
the rcorr.cens package in Hmisc in R and were evaluated
by the C-index. The larger the C-index, the more accurate
was the prognostic prediction [9]. During the external
validation of the nomogram, the total points of each
patient in the test set were calculated according to the
established nomogram, then Cox regression in this set was
performed using the total points as a factor, and finally,
the C-index and calibration curve were derived based
on the regression analysis. The training set and test set
was split into four subgroups according to quartiles of
the risk score. To assess for differences in survival of the
subgroups Kaplan-Meier curves were made. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
