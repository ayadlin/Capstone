ABSTRACT:
Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations.
MMSET, identified by its fusion to the IgH locus in t(4;14) MM, is universally
overexpressed in t(4;14) MM. In order to identify cell surface biomarkers associated
with t(4;14) MM for small molecule or antibody based therapies, we knocked down
MMSET expression with shRNA and generated a cell line pair from KMS11, a t(4;14)
MM cell line. We used quantitative mass spectrometry to identify plasma membrane
proteins associated with MMSET overexpression. Using this approach, 50 cell surface
proteins were identified as differentially expressed between KMS11 and KMS11/
shMMSET. Western blot and flow cytometry analysis indicated SLAMF7 was overexpressed in t(4;14) MM cell lines and down-regulated by MMSET shRNAs. SLAMF7
expression was also confirmed in primary t(4;14) MM samples by flow cytometry
analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR and ChIP analysis indicated MMSET might regulate the
transcription level of SLAMF7 and be an important functional element for SLAMF7
promoter activity. Furthermore, SLAMF7 shRNA could induce G1 arrest or apoptosis
and reduce clonogenetic capacity in t(4;14) MM cells. Overall, these results illustrated
SLAMF7 might be a novel cell surface protein associated with t(4;14) MM. It is
potential to develop t(4;14) MM targeted therapy by SLAMF7 antibody mediated drug
delivery.

INTRODUCTION

FGFR3 has transforming activity in vitro and in vivo, but
approximately 30% of t(4;14) MM patients do not express
FGFR3, whereas overexpression of MMSET isoforms is
a universal feature of t(4;14) cases [5-7]. Furthermore, the
poor prognosis of t(4;14) persists irrespective of FGFR3
expression [7]. These data suggest that MMSET may be
the critical oncogene in this translocation. The MMSET
gene spans 120 kb, consists of 24 exons and undergoes
complex alternative splicing. Two major transcripts were
identified: type I encodes a protein of 647 amino acids
and type II encodes a protein of 1365 amino acids. Both
proteins share a common amino terminus [8]. A third
transcript initiated within a middle intron of MMSET

Recurrent chromosomal translocations are central to
the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis of hematologic
malignancies. In the past decade, it has become
apparent that approximately 50% of multiple myeloma
(MM) harbor recurrent translocations involving the
immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus on chromosome
14q32 [1-3]. The translocation t(4;14)(p16;q32) is one of
the most common translocation in MM, affecting 15%
of patients, and is associated with very poor prognosis
[4]. The t(4;14) translocation leads to the simultaneous
overexpression of two genes, FGFR3 and MMSET.

encodes a protein named RE-IIBP [9].
The 1365 amino acid MMSET protein
contains a SET domain that is found in many histone
methyltransferases (HMTs) and determines their
enzymatic activity [10]. Recently MMSET has been shown
to have histone methyltransferase activity and knockdown
studies have demonstrated that MMSET upregulation
contributes to cellular adhesion, clonogenic growth and
tumorigenicity [1, 10, 11]. While differentially expressed
genes were identified between cases with and without a
t(4;14) by using global gene expression microarrays, the
t(4;14) MM proteome is unknown [12, 13]. Currently
there is no drug targeting MMSET proteins directly.
The implications of identifying proteins with MMSETdependent expression are clear, as they could potentially
constitute novel biomarkers or targets for the treatment
of MM. Plasma membrane proteins play a pivotal role in
regulating cell-cell interaction, recognition, migration,
adhesion, and signal transduction [14]. It is noteworthy
that many clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets are
cell surface proteins. Herein, we seek to unveil potential
molecular cell surface markers on t(4;14) MM.

Plasma membrane proteins are present in relatively
low abundance and therefore are often overlooked or
not identified in broad spectrum, whole cell, or tissue
arrays [15]. Prefractionation enrichment strategies
are critical for comprehensive profiling of the plasma
membrane proteome. A number of methodologies
have been adopted, including the use of a membraneimpermeable biotinylation reagent that selectively labels
cell surface proteins which are subsequently purified
by avidin-affinity chromatography [16, 17]. Recently
stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture
(SILAC) has become widely used in mass spectrometry
(MS)-based quantitative proteomics [16-19]. This is
proving to be a simple, robust, yet powerful method to
complement transcription measurements at the protein
level. In this study, we identified differentially expressed
plasma membrane using cell surface biotinylation and
avidin affinity chromatography combined with a SILACbased MS approach (Figure 1). Our results illustrated
that SLAMF7 might be a novel cell surface biomarker
associated with t(4;14) MM.

protein precursors were identified using Mascot Server. Finally relative quantification of protein expression was determined by the
chromatographic response observed for each isotopic peptide pair in the MS.

known to be associated with t(4;14) MM [8]; IL6ST, a
signal transducer shared by many cytokines including
interleukin 6 [21]; CD99L2, a cell-surface protein that
is similar to CD99 [22]. Western-blot analysis indicated
only SLAMF7 was over-expressed in t(4;14) MM cell
lines and decreased by MMSET knockdown (Fig. 2A).
FGFR3, IL6LT and CD99L2 were also over-expressed in
t(4;14) MM cell lines, but they might not be associated
with MMSET overexpression as their expression was not
changed with MMSET knockdown, except that FGFR3
was reduced in KMS28BM cells and IL6LT was reduced
in KMS18 cells (Fig. 2A). We further validated SLAMF7
expression by flow cytometric analysis, and confirmed that
SLAMF7 was over-expressed in t(4;14) MM cell lines
and reduced upon MMSET knockdown (Fig. 2B), while
four of five non-t(4;14) MM cell lines expressed low level
of SLAMF7 (Fig. 2B). Direct flow cytometric analysis
indicated that SLAMF7 was expressed highly in all of
three t(4;14) patient samples and one of three non-t(4;14)
patient samples, and weakly in two of three non-t(4;14)
patient samples (Fig. 2C). In summary all the t(4;14)
MM cell lines and patient samples tested over-expressed
SLAMF7 whereas only some of the t(4;14) negative cell
lines and patient samples over-expressed SLAMF7. The
data presented here suggest that SLAMF7 over-expression
might be associated with MMSET expression in t(4;14)
MM.

and

In order to identify cell surface biomarkers
associated with t(4;14) MM, we cultured KMS11, a
t(4;14) MM cell line, with SILAC method. The “light”
and “heavy” cell populations were treated with control or
MMSET shRNAs respectively, then a cell line pair was
generated (Supplementary Fig. S1). The cell line pair
were mixed at 1:1 ratio by cell counting, and labeled with
sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in situ. The labeled cells were lysed
and plasma membrane proteins were enriched by avidin
affinity chromatography followed by separating the elution
on SDS-PAGE. Extracted peptides from in-gel trypsin
digested gel slices were subjected to nanoLC OrbitrapMS analysis. MS data were analyzed using MaxQuant
software (Fig. 1). After MS analysis, we identified 144
differentially expressed proteins with P (ratio significance
B) <0.05 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). The
cellular localization of each identified protein was further
investigated based on Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA)
database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA). Approximately
51% of identified proteins are membrane or membraneassociated proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2). Known
functions of some of these proteins include cell-cell or
cell-matrix adhesion, receptors of cytokines or growth
factors, and transporter of substances across membranes.

MMSET Regulating the Transcription Level of
SLAMF7 Gene
To explore the mechanism of MMSET protein
regulating the expression of SLAMF7, we determined
SLAMF7 mRNA levels upon MMSET knockdown.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis indicated that SLAMF7
mRNA levels were significantly reduced upon MMSET
knockdowns in all t(4;14) MM cell lines (Fig. 3A). We
performed quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) for MMSET II occupancy at the 5’ regulatory
region of the SLAMF7 gene. We observed that the
MMSET II protein binding was concentrated in an
upstream region (near −1,500 bp) of SLAMF7 transcript

Validation of Differential Protein Expression
To validate the findings of above MS-based
quantification results, we analyzed selected cell surface
proteins by Western-blot. SLAMF7, identified by MS
analysis as one of most differentially expressed proteins,
was selected for validation because it is currently being
tested as a potential therapeutic antibody target in MM
[20]. Three more differentially expressed proteins were
also selected for further analysis: FGFR3, which is

start site. We also found a markedly reduced presence of
the MMSET II protein in the SLAMF7 promoter when
MMSET expression was knocked-down (Fig. 3B). We
further performed luciferase reporter assay using the
SLAMF7 promoter (-2165/+193) and its two truncations in
KMS11 cells. We found the activity of SLAMF7 promoter
(-2165/+193) was decreased significantly when MMSET
expression was reduced. Furthermore, deletion of the
-1744/-1335 region greatly reduced SLAMF7 promoter
activity (approximately four-fold) (Fig. 3C). These results
suggest that MMSET is an important functional element
for SLAMF7 promoter activity and is likely to reside in the
-1744/-1335 region of SLAMF7 promoter.

4A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Cell cycle analysis
indicated that the knocked down of SLAMF7 decreased S
phase cells and induced G1 arrest or apoptosis in t(4;14)
MM (Supplementary Fig. S3B). To assay for clonogenetic
capacity, MM cells were cultured in methylcellulose
medium. Eleven days after cell plating, t(4;14) MM cells
with SLAMF7 shRNA treatment had markedly reduced
ability to form colonies compared with controls, evidenced
by decreased colony number and size (Fig. 4B and 4C).
In the above assay, SLAMF7 shRNA had little effect on
KMS12BM, a non-t(4:14) MM cell line with low level of
SLAMF7.

DISCUSSION

Characterization of the SLAMF7 Activity in
T(4;14) MM Cells

MM is a malignant plasma cell disorder that
accounts for approximately 10% of all hematologic tumors
[23]. The t(4;14) translocation is the second most common
translocation in MM, affects 15% of MM patients, and
is associated with the worst prognosis [4, 5, 24, 25]. The
t(4;14) translocation results in over-expressing MMSET

To investigate the function of SLAMF7 in t(4;14)
MM cells, its expression was knocked down with
SLAMF7 shRNA. SLAMF7 down-regulation was
confirmed by qPCR and flow cytometric analysis (Fig.

genes [8]. Recently MMSET has been shown to have
histone methyltransferase activity and knockdown
studies have demonstrated that MMSET upregulation
contributes to cellular adhesion, clonogenic growth and
tumorigenicity [1, 10, 11]. Although MMSET proteins are
likely to be associated with the pathogenesis of t(4;14)
MM, currently there is no drug targeting MMSET proteins
directly. The proteins closely associated with or regulated
by MMSET expression might potentially constitute novel
biomarkers or therapeutic targets for t(4;14) MM. Because
of membrane proteins’ accessibility, they constitute about
60% of approved drug targets [26]. However, the relative
low abundances and hydrophobicity of most membrane
proteins impose challenges for determining their identities.
In this study, we identified cell surface markers depending
on MMSET expression using cell surface biotinylation and

avidin affinity chromatography combined with a SILACbased MS approach. MS results indicated that SLAMF7
might be a novel cell surface biomarker associated with
t(4;14) MM.
SLAMF7 (also known as CS1, CD319 and CRACC),
one of SLAM (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule)
family members, is a transmembrane glycoprotein
with 355 amino acids [27]. The cytoplasmic domain of
SLAMF7 contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
switch motifs (ITSMs), whose activation could induce
tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1/2 [27, 28]. SLAMF7
is selectively expressed on activated B cells, NK cells,
mature dendritic cells and a subset of cytotoxic T cells, and
a positive regulator of above cells [27, 29-31]. Recently,
it was reported that SLAMF7 is over-expressed on MM
cells and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of

MM, but the mechanism of over-expressing SLAMF7 on
MM is not known [20, 32]. In previous gene expression
analysis in MM patient samples, t(4;14) MM cells have
one of the highest SLAMF7 expression [32]. Our data also
showed that SLAMF7 was over-expressed in all of three
t(4;14) primary MM samples and one of three non-t(4;14)
primary MM samples. In this study we found MMSET
knockdown could reduce SLAMF7 levels in t(4;14) MM
cells. Furthermore, we found MMSET proteins were
enriched in the SLAMF7 promoter region and regulated
the transcription level of SLAMF7. Thus, one of the
mechanism leading to SLAMF7 expression in MM and the
higher expression observed in t(4;14) MM may be a direct
effect on it transcription and expression by the MMSET

protein. Previous studies showed that SLAMF7 could
induce proliferation and autocrine cytokine expression
on human B lymphocytes [31]. Here we showed that
SLAMF7 knockdown could induce cell cycle G1 arrest
or apoptosis, and reduce colony formation in t(4;14)
MM cells, suggesting a potential role of SLAMF7 in the
tumorigenicity of MM. Since the cell cycle plays a critical
role in chemosensitivity for combination chemotherapy
[33], we also investigated whether SLAMF7 knocking
down could potentiate the activity of bortezomib, a
proteasome inhibitor with significant activity in myeloma.
Although previous report indicated bortezomib could
enhance Elotuzumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody
against SLAMF7) mediated antibody-dependent cell-

upon shSLAMF7 treatment. (B and C) T(4;14) MM cells with SLAMF7 ShRNA treatment had markedly reduced ability to form colonies
compared with control shLuc. Data represent the mean ± SD derived from 3 separate experiments. KMS12BM, a non-t(4:14) MM cell line
with low level of SLAMF7, is a negative control. ShLuc, control shRNA; Sh#91, and Sh#96, SLAMF7 shRNAs.

mediated cytotoxicity [34], our data indicated SLAMF7
knocking down only marginally potentiated bortezomib
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Sequence-specific gene silencing with small
interfering RNA (siRNA) has transformed basic science
research, and the efficacy of siRNA therapeutics toward a
variety of diseases is now being evaluated in pre-clinical
and clinical trials [35]. The key therapeutic advantage of
using siRNA lies in its ability to specifically and potently
knock down the expression of disease-causing genes
of known sequence. However, clinical use of siRNAs
encounters one of obstacles: delivery of siRNAs to the
appropriate cells. Antibody-mediated delivery is an
effective method of targeting siRNA to particular cells
[36]. Our study showed that SLAMF7 overexpression
in t(4;14) MM was associated with MMSET expression.
Thus, it is potential to develop t(4;14) MM targeted
therapy by SLAMF7 antibody mediated MMSET siRNA
delivery. This therapeutic strategy will achieve two levels
of targeting for t(4;14) MM: tumor cell selective delivery
by the SLAMF7 antibody and gene pathway selectivity
by the MMSET siRNA. Therefore, this therapeutic
strategy would avoid nonspecific silencing and toxicity in
bystander cells.

supplemented with normal L-lysine and L-arginine, and
the “heavy” cell population was supplemented with13C6L-lysine and 13C615N4-L-arginine. The cells were allowed
to grow for six doubling times to achieve maximum
incorporation of heavy amino acids into proteins. Labeling
efficiencies were determined by MS analysis of peptides
from light- and heavy-labeled proteins and were found to
be >98%.

Virus Production and Infection
The sequences encoding short hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) against MMSET or SLAMF7 (Supplementary
Table S2) were cloned into lentiviral vector pLKO.1.
Lentivirus infection was performed as previously
described [40, 41]. Briefly, lentiviruses were produced
by transiently cotransfecting HEK293T cells with the
shRNA-expressing lentivirus vector, packaging plasmid
pMDLg/pRRE and pRSV-Rev, and VSV-G envelope
plasmid pCMV-VSVG using X-tremeGENE HP DNA
Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to
the manufacturers’ instructions. Cells were infected with
lentiviruses in the presence of 8 µg/mL polybrene (SigmaAldrich). Protein expression was analyzed 3 days after
infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell Surface Protein Isolation
Cell Lines and Cell Culture

“Heavy” KMS11 cells were treated with MMSET
shRNA and cultured for 72 h, while “light” KMS11
cells were treated with shLuc as a control. The two cell
populations were counted and mixed in a 1:1 ratio (a total
of 4x107 cells) followed by two rounds of washing in PBS.
Cell surface protein isolation was performed using Pierce
Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (#89881) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were resuspended at 1x106 cells/mL in PBS with 0.25 mg/mL
Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and incubated for 30 min at 4°C.
The biotinylation reaction was quenched by the addition
of 2 mL of Quenching Solution following two washes
with TBS. Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer containing
protease inhibitors (Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail,
Pierce #78410). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation
at 10000 x g for 2 min at 4°C. Biotinylated proteins were
affinity purified with NeutrAvidin Agarose and eluted with
SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 1%
SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM DTT).

Human MM cell lines KMS11, KMS12BM,
KMS18, KMS28BM and OPM-2 were maintained in
RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.
MM cell line NCI-H929 was cultured in RPMI 1640
with 15% FCS and 0.00036% 2-mercaptoethanol. All
MM cell lines except KMS12BM are t(4;14) positive.
All MM cell lines are from Prof Rafael Fonseca and P.
Leif Bergsagel laboratories (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale)
and have been tested, authenticated, and previously used
in the peer-reviewed articles from the laboratories [37,
38]. HEK293T cells (from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were
maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FCS, 100
U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. All cells
were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2.

SILAC

Mass Spectrometry Analysis

SILAC was performed as described previousely
[39]. Two populations of KMS11 cells were maintained
in lysine and arginine depleted RPMI1640 medium
(Pierce SILAC Protein Quantitation Kit) supplemented
with 10% dialyzed FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100
μg/mL streptomycin. The “light” cell population was

Immunoblot Analysis

tryptic digestion, peptide extraction and reconstitution
were carried out as previously described[42]. Vacuum
dried peptide samples were reconstituted in 0.1% formic
acid and analysed using nanoHPLC (Proxeon, Thermo
Scientific) coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo
Scientific). Peptides were trapped onto a C18 precolumn and separated on an analytical column using
2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid as Solvent A and 80%
acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid as Solvent B. A 120 min
gradient ranging from 5% to 50% solvent B, followed by
a 5 min gradient ranging from 50% to 100% Solvent B at
the flow rate of 250 nL/min was used. Peptide samples
were analyzed on an Orbitrap XL (Thermo Scietific) with
two technical replicates. Survey full scan MS spectra
(m/z 300–1400) were acquired with a resolution of r =
60,000 at m/z 400, an AGC target of 1e6, and a maximum
injection time of 500 ms. The ten most intense peptide
ions in each survey scan with an ion intensity of >2000
counts and a charge state ≥2 were isolated sequentially to
a target value of 1e4 and fragmented in the linear ion trap
by collisionally-induced dissociation using a normalized
collision energy of 35%. A dynamic exclusion was applied
using a maximum exclusion list of 500 with one repeat
count, repeat, and exclusion duration of 30 s.

Cells were treated with shRNAs and cultured for
72 h. Cells were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer as
described previously [44]. Equal amounts of protein were
separated on SDS–polyacrylamide gels and transferred
to PVDF membranes. The blots were probed with
antibodies against CS1(SLAMF7) (sc-53576), FGFR3
(sc-13121) and β-Actin (sc-69879) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. The blots were probed with antibodies
against IL6ST (#H00003572-M05, NOVUS), MMSET
(#75359 Abcam), CD99L2 (#AF5185, R&D SYSTEMS).
Western Blotting Luminol Reagent (sc-2048) was used for
detection on film from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Preparation of primary myeloma cells
Primary myeloma cells were obtained from bone
marrow aspirates by purification with human CD138
selection kit (StemCell Technologies, #18357). Purified
primary myeloma cells were re-suspended with RPMI/
DMSO freezing medium and stored in liquid nitrogen.
All primary cells were obtained from routine diagnostic
samples after informed consent was provided by the
patients and permission given by the NUS Institutional
Review Board.

Identification and Quantification of Peptides and
Proteins

Flow Cytometric and Cell Cycle Analysis

Data were searched using Mascot (version 2.2;
Matrix Science, London, UK) against a concatenated
target/decoy database, prepared appending a sequencereversed by human International Protein Index (IPI)
(version 3.52, 73,928 sequences) and adding common
contaminants such as human keratins, porcine trypsin,
and proteases to yield a total of 148,380 sequences.
Database searches were performed with tryptic specificity
allowing maximum two missed cleavages and two
labeled amino acids as well as an initial mass tolerance
of 7ppm for precursor ions and 0.5Da for fragment ions.
Cysteine carbamidomethylation was searched as a fixed
modification, and N-acetylation and oxidized methionine
were searched as variable modifications. Labeled
arginine and lysine were specified as fixed or variable
modifications, depending on the prior knowledge about
the parent ion. SILAC peptide and protein quantification
was performed with MaxQuant version 1.0.13.13 (19, 20)
using default settings. Maximum false discovery rates
were set to 0.01 for both protein and peptide. Proteins
were considered identified when supported by at least one
unique peptide with a minimum length of six amino acids.
The differentially expressed proteins were selected based
on the Ratio Significance B < 0.05 [43].

Cells were treated with shRNAs and cultured for
72 h. Then, cells were collected and stained for flow
cytometric analysis as previously described [45]. Primary
antibody was CS1(SLAMF7) (sc-53576, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and secondary antibody was Alexa
Fluor 488 goat anti—mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Directly
conjugated CS1 antibody (FITC, sc-53577, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) was used for patient sample analysis. The
data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.). Cells
were treated with SLAMF7 shRNA and cultured for 72
h. Then, cells were collected and stained with propidium
iodide (PI) for cell cycle analysis as previously described
[46].

QPCR
Cells were treated with shRNAs and cultured for 48
h. Total RNA was extracted by using the Qiagen RNeasy
Mini kit (Germany). Using oligo(dT)20 primer and reverse
transcriptase, cDNA was created by using the Invitrogen
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System. QPCR
analysis was performed as previously described [41]. The
primers for qPCR were listed in Supplementary Table S3.

ChIP Assay

Statistical Analysis

KMS11 cells were treated with shRNAs for 72 h and
fixed in 1% formaldehyde. ChIPs were performed using
SimpleChIP™ Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (#9002, Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. A rabbit anti-MMSET antibody for ChIP was
produced from a rabbit immunized against the recombinant
GST-tagged C-terminal peptides of MMSET II (residues
1329–1365), which was expressed in Escherichia coli and
purified in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
(GE Healthcare). Input controls consisted of 2% chromatin
before immunoprecipitation. Purified DNA from crosslinked cells was used for qPCR with a subset of primers
across SLAMF7 promoter (Supplementary Table S4). Data
obtained by qPCR were plotted as percent input control.

Results were expressed as mean values ± SD, and
t-test was used for evaluating statistical significance.
Results were considered to be significant when p < 0.05.

Construction of luciferase reporter vectors

REFERENCES

The SLAMF7 promoter region was PCR amplificated
from KMS11 genomic DNA using forward and reverse
primers containing Xho I and Hind III restriction sites
(Supplementary Table S5). After restriction digestion,
the fragments were cloned into the pGL3-Control
vector (digested with Xho I and Hind III to delete SV40
promoter) to generate the SLAMF7 promoter constructs,
pGL3-SLAMF7 (-2165/+193) and pGL3-SLAMF7-Δ2
(-1335/+193). The pGL3-SLAMF7-Δ1 (deletion of -1744/1336) was generated by cloning SLAMF7 -1335/+193
into pGL3-SLAMF7 (-2165/+193) (digested with ExoR I
and Hind III to delete -1733/+193). The constructs were
verified by nucleotide sequencing.

KMS11 cells were treated with shRNAs and
cultured for 24 h. Then, cells were cotransfected with
firefly luciferase reporter construct and Renilla luciferase
reporter vector pRL-SV40 (Promega) in a ratio of
200:1 using X-tremeGENE transfection reagent (Roche
Diagnostics). Cells were harvested after 24 h and analyzed
for luciferase activity using Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega). The promoter activity was
calculated by dividing the luciferase activity of constructs
by the internal Renilla luciferase activity.
