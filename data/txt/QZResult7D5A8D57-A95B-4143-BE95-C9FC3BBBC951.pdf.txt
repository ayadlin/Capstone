Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) are ubiquitous environmental
pollutants found in tobacco smoke, air pollution, and grilled foods. Prenatal exposure to BaP causes premature
reproductive senescence in mice, and other PAHs are transplacental ovarian carcinogens. Glutathione (GSH) is
critical for detoxiﬁcation of the reactive metabolites of PAHs. Therefore, we hypothesized that mice that are
genetically deﬁcient in GSH synthesis, due to deletion of the modiﬁer subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclm),
the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, have increased destruction of oogonia, premature ovarian failure, and
ovarian tumorigenesis after transplacental BaP exposure compared with Gclmþ/þ females. Gclmþ/ female and
male mice were mated, and dams were treated with 0, 2, or 10 mg/kg/d BaP in sesame oil by gavage from
gestational days 7 to 16. Compared with oil-treated F1 females of the same genotype, Gclm/ prenatally BaPtreated females had signiﬁcantly greater decrements in offspring production than Gclmþ/þ BaP-treated females.
Similarly, we observed signiﬁcant BaP dose  Gclm genotype interactions on ovarian follicle counts and ovarian
tumor multiplicity at 7.5 months of age, with Gclm/ females having greater decrements in follicle numbers and
more ovarian tumors in response to prenatal BaP exposure than Gclmþ/þ females. The ovarian tumors were
positive for the epithelial marker cytokeratin. Our results show that prenatal exposure of females to BaP causes
premature ovarian failure and ovarian tumorigenesis and that embryonic GSH deﬁciency due to deletion of Gclm
increases sensitivity to these transplacental ovarian effects of BaP. Cancer Res; 73(2); 908–17. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Sixty percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer will
die of the disease; it is the leading cause of death from
gynecologic cancers. Because ovarian cancer tends to be
asymptomatic until it has reached an advanced stage, treatment is often ineffective. Understanding the causes of ovarian
cancer is critical for the development of preventive strategies
and methods for early diagnosis, yet the underlying cause of
most ovarian cancers remains elusive. Ninety percent of
malignant ovarian cancers in women are histologically classiﬁed as epithelial, whereas about 7% are classiﬁed as stromal
(1). Epithelial ovarian cancers are thought to originate from the
ovarian surface epithelium, and stromal ovarian cancers are

thought to originate from granulosa cells, theca cells, other
stromal cells, or their counterparts in the testicular sex cords
(Sertoli cells and Leydig cells; ref. 1).
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are ubiquitous
environmental pollutants found in air pollution, cooked foods,
and tobacco smoke. Human biomonitoring data show that
essentially all Americans are exposed to PAHs (2). It has been
known for decades that PAHs like benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) are
toxic to the ovary, destroying ovarian follicles and causing
ovarian tumors in rodents. The PAHs 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), 3-methylcholanthrene, and BaP all destroyed
follicles in pre- and peripubertal mice after both single high
doses (3, 4) and repeated low doses (5). The signiﬁcant PAH
content of tobacco smoke is thought to play a role in the known
ovarian toxicity of smoking. Women who smoke have decreased
per menstrual cycle probability of pregnancy compared with
women who do not smoke (6, 7), and the onset of menopause
occurs several years earlier in women who smoke (8). Treatment of adult mice with various PAHs by several routes induced
ovarian tumors (9–11), and women who smoke have increased
risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (12, 13).
There is increasing evidence that environmental exposures
that occur during embryonic and fetal development modify the
risk for developing diseases, such as cancer, in adulthood.
In utero exposure to PAHs causes ovarian toxicity to the female
offspring. Treatment of pregnant mice with BaP dose

Glutathione Deﬁciency and Transplacental Ovarian Cancer

dependently decreased fertility and resulted in atrophic ovaries
with few follicles in female offspring (14). Transplacental
ovarian carcinogenesis has been shown for the PAHs DMBA
(15) and dibenz[def,p]chrysene (16), but to the best of our
knowledge, has not been reported for BaP. BaP, like dibenz[def,
p]chrysene, is relevant to humans because environmental
exposure to these 2 PAHs is ubiquitous, whereas DMBA is not
present in the environment.
To exert their toxicity, PAHs generally require metabolic
activation to toxic metabolites by the phase I metabolizing
enzymes, cytochromes P450 (CYP) and microsomal epoxide
hydrolase (17). Of the major CYPs involved in PAH metabolism,
Cyp1b1 is expressed in mouse embryos from embryonic day (E)
11 to E17, whereas Cyp1a1 is expressed on E7, but not later, and
Cyp1a2 is not expressed (18, 19). To our knowledge, no information is available on fetal ovary expression of any of these
CYPs in mice. Prostaglandin–endoperoxide synthases are also
key enzymes involved in bioactivation of PAHs in the developing embryo (20, 21). Prostaglandin–endoperoxide synthases
oxidize PAHs to free radical intermediates, which can initiate
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (21). Phase II metabolism or detoxiﬁcation of toxic BaP metabolites occurs via
glutathione-S-transferase–catalyzed conjugation with glutathione (GSH; refs. 22, 23). During mouse development, embryos
express GSH synthetic enzymes and synthesize GSH beginning
at the blastocyst stage (24). Expression of Gsta4 is present in the
whole embryo on E7.5 and E8.5 and in the ovary on E14.5, and
Gstp1, Gstp2, Gstm1, and Gstm2 are expressed throughout the
embryo on E14.5 (25).
GSH is the most abundant intracellular nonprotein thiol and
one of the most important intracellular antioxidants. It is
present in cells at millimolar concentrations. GSH has numerous intracellular functions, including reduction of hydrogen
peroxide and lipid peroxides as a cofactor for GSH peroxidases,
detoxiﬁcation of electrophilic toxicants as a cofactor for glutathione-S-transferases, regulation of protein function, and
regulation of nucleotide metabolism. GSH is synthesized in
2 ATP-dependent reactions (26). The ﬁrst, rate-limiting reaction is catalyzed by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), a heterodimer composed of a catalytic (GCLC) and a modiﬁer (GCLM)
subunit. Mice that lack Gclc die during embryonic development (27, 28). Mice that lack Gclm survive and reproduce but
have greatly reduced tissue levels of GSH (29, 30). We recently
reported that female Gclm/ mice have compromised fertility
due to early preimplantation embryo mortality (31).
In view of the importance of GSH in maintaining cellular
redox status and in detoxifying reactive metabolites of BaP, we
hypothesized that Gclm-null mice have greater sensitivity to
the ovarian toxicity of prenatal exposure to BaP. We further
hypothesized that BaP is a transplacental ovarian carcinogen
and that female Gclm-null mice are more susceptible than
wild-type littermates to ovarian tumorigenesis resulting from
in utero BaP exposure.

Animals
Gclm-null mice were generated by disrupting the Gclm gene
by replacing exon 1 with a b-galactosidase/neomycin phosphotransferase fusion minigene (30, 32). The mice were backcrossed 8 times onto a C57BL/6J genetic background
(B6.129-Gclmtm1Tjka; hereafter referred to as Gclm/). Mice
for these experiments were generated at the University of
California, Irvine (UC Irvine). Offspring were genotyped by
PCR using primers for both the native Gclm sequence and the
b-Geo sequence on DNA extracted from tail or toe snips as
previously described (32). The mice were housed in an American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care–accredited facility, with free access to deionized water
and soy-free laboratory chow, on a 14:10 hour light–dark cycle.
Temperature was maintained at 21 to 23 C. The experimental
protocols were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UC Irvine.
Monitoring of estrous cycles
Estrous cycle stage in individually housed adult female mice
was evaluated every morning by microscopic examination of
fresh vaginal lavage ﬂuid obtained in 0.9% sodium chloride.
Experimental protocols
Gclmþ/ female mice were mated with Gclmþ/ or Gclm/
male mice on the afternoon of proestrus based on vaginal
cytology. Females were checked for vaginal plugs the following
morning. The day of vaginal plug detection in the female was
designated gestational day (GD) 1. Dams were treated by oral
gavage with 10 mg/kg BaP in sesame oil daily from GD7 to
GD16 (experiment 1) or 2 mg/kg/d from GD7 to GD16 (experiment 2). Control animals were gavaged with the same volume of
sesame oil alone in both experiments. The dosing regimen in
experiment 1 was based on a previous study in mice, which
showed that offspring of dams treated with this dose had
reduced fertility compared with controls but were not completely infertile (14). We used the lower dose in the second study
because of an apparently increased intrauterine mortality of
Gclm/ female fetuses in experiment 1. Of 8 litters born to
dams treated with 10 mg/kg BaP, only 2 Gclm/ females (both
from the same litter) were born, compared with 7 Gclmþ/þ
females from 5 litters. Dams were allowed to deliver and care for
their litters. Litters were weaned on postnatal day (PND) 21, and
dams were euthanized with CO2 on the day of weaning. Maternal
ovaries were processed for histomorphometry.
Fertility of Gclm/ and Gclmþ/þ female offspring was
tested in a continuous breeding assay (see below). At the end
of the breeding assay, female mice were removed from their
mates. After the last litter was delivered, estrous cycles were
monitored for at least 14 days and mice were killed by CO2
asphyxiation on the next morning of estrus or on day 15 if they
were not cycling. Skin, mammary glands, livers, kidneys, lungs,
uteri, and ovaries were carefully examined for gross evidence of
tumors at necropsy. In experiment 1, both ovaries were ﬁxed in
Bouin ﬁxative, processed for histology, serially sectioned at 5
mm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and used for histomorphometry, including diagnosis of ovarian tumors. In

experiment 2, both ovaries were examined for ovarian tumors.
One ovary was processed as for experiment 1 and used for
histomorphometry, and the other was ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryopreserved in 15% sucrose in PBS, embedded in
optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding compound,
and every fourth section was used for hematoxylin and eosin
staining. Gclmþ/ female offspring were sacriﬁced by CO2
euthanasia at 35 days of age, and ovaries were processed as
for experiment 1 for ovarian histomorphometry.
Female fertility assessment
Beginning at 2 months of age, control or BaP-treated
Gclmþ/þ or Gclm/ female mice were mated to wild-type,
10-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Jackson Laboratories) for
a continuous breeding assay. Females were checked daily for
pups. On the day of birth, live and dead pups were counted
and sexed, live pups were weighed, and pups were humanely
euthanized.
Ovarian histomorphometry
Complete serial histologic sections from each animal were
evaluated by 2 of the investigators (U. Luderer and J. Lim)
without knowledge of genotype or treatment using an Olympus
BX60 microscope equipped with Plan Fluor 10, 20, and 40
objectives, Plan Achromat 4 objective (Olympus America),
and a Retiga 2000R cooled CCD mono digital camera (QImaging). Ovarian follicles were classiﬁed as primordial (single
layer of ﬂattened granulosa cells), primary (single layer of
cuboidal or mixed cuboidal/ﬂattened granulosa cells), secondary (more than one layer of granulosa cells), or antral (possessing an antral cavity or several ﬂuid ﬁlled vesicles in the case of
early antral follicles) and were further classiﬁed as healthy or
atretic. Atretic secondary and antral follicles were identiﬁed by
the presence of 3 or more pyknotic granulosa cells per largest
cross section and separation of the oocyte from the granulosa
cells (33). Atretic primordial and primary follicles were identiﬁed by eosinophilic oocytes (34). Primordial, primary, and
secondary follicles were counted in every ﬁfth serial section.
The counts were multiplied 5 times to obtain estimates of the
total number of follicles per ovary (35). Antral follicles were
followed through every serial section, taking care to count each
of these structures only once. Each section of the ovaries from
7.5-month-old mice was also evaluated for the presence of
ovarian tumors or cysts by a board-certiﬁed veterinary pathologist (G.W. Lawson) blind to genotype and treatment. Perpendicular tumor diameters were measured in the largest tumor
cross section. The average tumor diameter was calculated for
each animal. Several tumors contained very large cysts. For
these cystic tumors, the largest diameters with and without the
cyst were measured, and average diameters were calculated
with and without the cyst. Sensitivity analyses compared the
effect of genotype on average tumor diameter when cysts were
included versus not included in the measurements.
Immunostaining
One slide was selected from each ovarian tumor for destaining with 1% hydrochloric acid and 1.5% ammonium hydroxide
in 70% ethanol and subsequent immunostaining with an

910

Cancer Res; 73(2) January 15, 2013

antibody directed against mouse pancytokeratin (Sigma
C1801, Clone PCK-25), a marker for epithelial ovarian tumors
(36). Immunostaining was done using the Mouse on Mouse
(MOM) Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories). Brieﬂy, slides were subjected to antigen
retrieval in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate with 0.05% Tween-20
at 95 C, blocked with mouse MOM immunoglobulin G blocking reagent, washed, blocked with avidin and biotin blocking
reagents, washed, incubated with 1:50 dilution of primary
antibody in MOM diluent, washed, incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS to block endogenous peroxidases, incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody, washed, incubated with ABC reagent, washed, incubated with diaminobenzidine substrate in peroxide buffer, and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Negative control slides (without primary antibody, primary antibody replaced with mouse immunoglobulin,
without secondary antibody) and an untreated ovary control
were run simultaneously with the experimental slides. All
negative control slides showed no nonspeciﬁc staining. The
untreated ovary showed staining only in the ovarian surface
epithelium.
Statistical analyses
Because experiments 1 and 2 were conducted 2 years apart,
the effect of the experiment on various endpoints was examined for Gclmþ/þ females exposed prenatally to 0 mg/kg BaP.
As there were no signiﬁcant effects of the experiment on any of
the endpoints, the data were combined for subsequent analyses. The effects of genotype and BaP dose on continuous
outcome variables were analyzed using generalized estimating
equations, a form of generalized linear models, with BaP dose,
Gclm genotype, and BaP times genotype interaction modeled
as ﬁxed effects. To adjust for litter effects, litter numbers were
entered into the model as a subject effect. An unstructured
working correlation matrix was used for the litter effects,
except in the rare cases when the model did not converge, in
which case an exchangeable working correlation matrix was
used (assumes homogeneous correlation among littermates).
When the outcome variable was a fraction (e.g., fraction of
corniﬁed or leukocytic vaginal cytology), the data were ﬁrst
arcsine square root-transformed before they were entered into
the models; for these analyses only, the unadjusted means and
SEMs were used for presentation of the data. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 20.0 for MacIntosh.

Results
Effects of gestational treatment with BaP on F0 dams
Data on pregnancy outcomes are shown in Table 1. The
percentage of F0 females with vaginal plugs that delivered
litters did not differ by BaP dose. Litter size did not differ by BaP
dose. Full litter mortality occurred for 5 of thirteen 10 mg/kg
BaP-treated dams, 4 of nineteen 2 mg/kg BaP-treated dams,
and 6 of 26 control dams; the effect of BaP dose was not
statistically signiﬁcant. Although fewer Gclm/ female offspring were born to 10 mg/kg BaP-treated females than to 2
mg/kg BaP-treated or control females, the effect of BaP dose on
offspring genotype distributions was not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 1).

had prolapsed uteri and had to be euthanized before the end of
the 20-week breeding study in experiment 1. Both were wild
type, one in the control group and one in the 10 mg/kg/d BaPtreated group. Among the remaining mice, in utero treatment
with 10 mg/kg/d BaP profoundly decreased fertility of female
mice of both genotypes, whereas treatment with 2 mg/kg/d
BaP decreased fertility to a much greater extent in Gclm/
females than in Gclmþ/þ females. Two of two 10 mg/kg/d BaPtreated Gclm/ mice and 4 of 6 Gclmþ/þ 10 mg/kg/d BaPtreated mice delivered no litters and showed no signs of
pregnancy during the study period. The other 2 surviving
Gclmþ/þ 10 mg/kg/d BaP-treated mice had 1 and 3 litters,
and the BaP-treated mouse with uterine prolapse had delivered
the second litter, when she was euthanized at week 11 of
the study. The effects of genotype (P < 0.001) and BaP dose (P <
0.001) on the number of litters produced in 20 weeks were
statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 1A). In addition, to having fewer
litters, BaP-treated females produced fewer offspring in 20
weeks (P < 0.001, effect of BaP dose); this effect of prenatal BaP
treatment was more pronounced in the Gclm/ females
than in the Gclmþ/þ females (P<0.001, BaP dose  genotype
interaction; Fig. 1B). Gclm/ females produced signiﬁcantly
fewer pups compared with Gclmþ/þ littermates (P < 0.001,
effect of genotype), as we have previously reported (31).
Estrous cycle data collected after completion of the breeding
study are shown in Table 2. Two of 13 Gclmþ/þ and 2 of 12
Gclm/ oil-treated female offspring were not cycling at 7.5
months of age. None of the 10 mg/kg/d BaP-treated offspring
displayed estrous cycles (P < 0.05, effect of BaP on presence or
absence of cycles). Most of the 10 mg/kg/d BaP-treated mice
had persistently corniﬁed vaginal cytology, whereas most of
the irregularly cycling control and 2 mg/kg/d BaP mice had
predominantly leukocytic vaginal cytology (P < 0.005, effect of
BaP on percentage of corniﬁed and percentage of leukocytic
vaginal smears). Predominantly corniﬁed vaginal cytology,
termed "persistent vaginal estrus," is uncommon in normal
aged, reproductively senescent mice, whereas predominantly
leukocytic vaginal cytology is commonly observed in aged
mice. Persistent corniﬁed vaginal histology has been reported
following neonatal treatment with various estrogenic chemicals. The number of transitions between corniﬁed and leukocytic cytology, consistent with an estrus to metestrus transition, in 14 days declined signiﬁcantly with BaP dose (P < 0.001,
effect of BaP). There were no effects of BaP dose or genotype on

Gestational BaP treatment decreased ovarian follicle
numbers in offspring
To assess the effect of gestational treatment with BaP on
prepubertal ovarian follicle numbers, ovarian histomorphometry was conducted on a subset of the Gclm heterozygous F1
female offspring from experiments 1 and 2 at 35 days of age.
Exposure to BaP from GD 7 to 16 dose dependently decreased
the total number of healthy ovarian follicles from 2,250  348 in
0 mg/kg BaP-exposed, to 1,036  338 in 2 mg/kg BaP-exposed,
and 34  16 in 10 mg/kg BaP-exposed (P < 0.001, effect of BaP
dose). The effect of BaP dose was statistically signiﬁcant for

and antral follicles (P ¼ 0.005; P ¼ 0.031; Table 3). Very few

atretic primordial or primary follicles were observed in any BaP
dose group, and there were no apparent effects of BaP dose on
these outcomes (data not shown).
Ovarian follicle counts were also conducted on both ovaries
per mouse in the breeding study from experiment 1 and 1 ovary
per mouse from the breeding study in experiment 2, both at
about 7.5 months of age (Fig. 2). Prenatal BaP exposure dose
dependently decreased the total number of healthy follicles, as
well as the numbers of healthy primordial, primary, secondary,
and antral follicles (P < 0.001, effects of BaP dose). Consistent
with the lack of litters in the 10 mg/kg/d BaP-treated mice after
week 12 of the breeding study, there were no antral or secondary follicles in any of the 10 mg/kg/d BaP-exposed ovaries.
Deletion of Gclm was associated with greater sensitivity to
follicle depletion due to prenatal BaP exposure. The interaction
between BaP dose and Gclm genotype was statistically significant for total follicle count (P < 0.001; Fig. 2A), primordial
follicle count (P < 0.001; Fig. 2B), primary follicle count (P ¼
0.025; Fig. 2C), and secondary follicle count (P ¼ 0.032, Fig. 2D).

Supplementary Fig. S1. Two of two 10 mg/kg/d BaP-treated
Gclm/ female offspring had bilateral ovarian tumors that
replaced the entire ovarian parenchyma and were invading the
periovarian fat. Three of six 10 mg/kg/d BaP-treated Gclmþ/þ
offspring had bilateral ovarian tumors, 2 of 6 had unilateral

ovarian tumors, and 1 of 6 had no ovarian tumors; 4 of the 8
tumors were invading the periovarian fat (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). Four of six 10 mg/kg/d BaP-treated Gclmþ/þ offspring
had very large, complex, ﬂuid-ﬁlled cysts within the ovaries; 2 of
these were in tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1C and Fig. 3C).
One of nine 2 mg/kg/d BaP-treated Gclm/ females had a
unilateral ovarian tumor (Supplementary Fig. S1F and Fig. 3D).
None of the ovaries from 2 mg/kg/d BaP-treated Gclmþ/þ
females or from 0 mg/kg/d BaP-treated females of either
genotype had any ovarian tumors. The adjusted average number of ovarian tumors per mouse was 0  0 for both 0 mg/kg/d

females (1,894  203 mm vs. 1,396  444 mm in the Gclmþ/þ
females), but the difference was no longer statistically significant (P ¼ 0.20).
All of the ovarian tumors were initially classiﬁed as stromal
tumors based on their histologic appearance (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Although invasion of the periovarian fat was noted for
several tumors, the relative paucity of mitotic ﬁgures and lack
of metastases was consistent with benign tumors. Immunostaining for the epithelial marker cytokeratin showed that all
but 2 of the tumors strongly expressed cytokeratin in the cells
lining the abundant tubule-like structures in these tumors (Fig.
3A–C). One of these cytokeratin-negative tumors, in a Gclmþ/þ
10 mg/kg/d BaP-exposed female, contained a large cyst, and
only the cells lining the cyst and the ovarian surface epithelium
displayed cytokeratin immunostaining (not shown). The other
cytokeratin-negative tumor was the only tumor found in a 2
mg/kg/d BaP-exposed female (Supplementary Fig. S1F and Fig.
3D); only the ovarian surface epithelium and a small epithelial
inclusion showed cytokeratin immunostaining. Cytokeratin is
expressed only in the ovarian surface epithelium in normal
ovaries (36). In view of this pattern of cytokeratin immunostaining, we concluded that the majority of the tumors induced
by prenatal BaP exposure were benign epithelial tumors, most
likely tubular adenomas. The 2 cytokeratin-negative tumors
were diagnosed as granulosa theca cell tumors based on their
histologic appearance.
We did not observe gross tumors in any organ besides
ovaries at necropsy. Histologic examination of the livers and
kidneys of the 10 mg/kg/d BaP-exposed mice also did not
reveal any tumors.

Discussion
Our results show for the ﬁrst time that the ubiquitous PAH
BaP is a transplacental ovarian tumorigen at doses that do not
produce tumors in other organs. The majority of the ovarian
tumors induced by prenatal exposure to BaP were positive for
the epithelial marker cytokeratin. Our study conﬁrms earlier
ﬁndings that prenatal oral exposure to the PAH BaP causes
premature reproductive senescence in F1 female mice (14), and
our data show that this is due to premature depletion of
ovarian follicles. Importantly, our data show that GSH deﬁciency due to deletion of Gclm sensitizes female embryos to
the ovotoxicity and the transplacental ovarian tumorigenicity
of BaP.
Transplacental exposure to the PAHs DMBA and dibenzo[def,p]chrysene has been reported to cause sex-cord stromal
ovarian tumors (15, 16), and our current results show that BaP
is also a transplacental ovarian carcinogen. Importantly,
immunostaining showed that most of the BaP-induced ovarian
tumors were strongly positive for cytokeratin, an epithelial cell
marker, indicating that they were of epithelial and not stromal
origin (36). Adult exposure to PAHs, including BaP, by several
routes has long been known to induce ovarian tumors in mice
(9–11). Although the doses used in those studies were high
compared with those used in the present study, the incidences
of females with ovarian tumors tended to be lower than we
observed in the 10 mg/kg/d BaP-treated group. Taken together,
these results suggest that the period of ovarian development is

www.aacrjournals.org

a sensitive window for ovarian carcinogenesis. Our data also
show for the ﬁrst time that embryonic GSH deﬁciency
increases the sensitivity to transplacental ovarian tumorigenesis by BaP. Our ﬁndings that transplacental PAH exposure
causes epithelial ovarian cancers in mice and that GSH-deﬁcient embryos have increased sensitivity to this effect have
relevance to humans. Mainstream and sidestream tobacco
smoke contains dozens of carcinogenic PAHs, including BaP,
and women who smoke have increased risk of epithelial
ovarian cancer (12, 13). Polymorphisms in GCLM and GCLC,
which affect GSH synthesis, exist in humans (37–40) and may
modulate sensitivity to transplacental ovarian toxicity and
tumorigenesis of PAHs.
Decreased ability to detoxify reactive metabolites of BaP
and/or ROS produced as a result of BaP metabolism likely
causes the increased sensitivity of the Gclm/ embryonic
ovary to BaP. GSH conjugation is an important phase II
detoxiﬁcation mechanism for the diol epoxide metabolites
(22, 23), which are thought to be the ovotoxic metabolites in
peripubertal mice (41). GSH conjugation is also important in
phase II metabolism of arene oxide and quinone metabolites of
PAHs. CYPs 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 are the major P450 enzymes
involved in the metabolic activation of BaP in vitro, although in
vivo metabolism of BaP by CYP1A1 seems to be more important in detoxiﬁcation (17, 42). Expression of most CYPs remains
low until after birth. Exceptions include transient constitutive
expression of Cyp1a1 on GD 7 in the mouse, induction of
Cyp1a1 expression in the liver and lung as early as GD 12.5 by
exposure to PAHs in the mouse, and constitutive expression of
Cyp1b1 in the mouse embryo from GD 11 onward and in the
human fetal thymus and kidney (18–20, 43). Previous work has
shown that embryos constitutively express prostaglandin–
endoperoxide synthase 1 and 2, that prostaglandin–endoperoxide synthases can bioactivate BaP to free radical intermediates that initiate ROS formation, that gestational treatment
with BaP increases embryonic oxidative protein and DNA
damage, and that antioxidants are protective against teratogenesis caused by BaP (21, 44, 45). Although these previous
studies did not examine developmental toxicity to the reproductive system, our ﬁndings of increased sensitivity of GSHdeﬁcient female embryos to transplacental ovarian toxicity of
BaP in the present study and our observation of increased
sensitivity of GSH-deﬁcient male embryos to transplacental
testicular toxicity of BaP (46) provide further support for a role
for oxidative stress in the developmental toxicity of BaP.
The mechanism by which transplacental exposure to BaP
and other PAHs causes ovarian tumors is uncertain. It is well
known that metabolism of PAHs leads to the formation of
mutagenic metabolites, including diol epoxides and ROS (17).
Although we are not aware of any published studies describing
PAH-induced ovarian mutations, BaP treatment caused testicular DNA adducts and germline mutations in male mice (47),
and BaP treatment resulted in the formation of ovarian DNA
adducts in adult mice and rats (48, 49). Different histopathologic types of ovarian tumors have been reported in Cyp1b1null mice (cystadenomas) versus wild-type mice (granulosa cell
tumors) treated with DMBA (48). The authors postulated that
this could be due to the absence of Cyp1a1 expression in

stromal cells, versus its presence in ovarian surface epithelial
cells where it could compensate for the lack of Cyp1b1. It is also
possible that different PAH metabolites have different mechanisms of ovarian tumorigenesis. Oocyte depletion has been
proposed to play a role in ovarian tumorigenesis by PAHs
(10, 11). Although most of the tumors that we observed
occurred in ovaries that were devoid of oocytes and follicles,
the tumor that occurred in the 2 mg/kg/d BaP-treated Gclm/
female occurred in an ovary that still contained hundreds of
healthy follicles. This supports the contention that oocyte
depletion and the resultant high levels of gonadotropin hormone secretion may promote ovarian tumor growth but may
not be required for ovarian tumor initiation.
The ED50 for primordial follicle destruction by 15 daily
intraperitoneal doses of BaP in peripubertal mice was 3 mg/
kg/d (5). In contrast, we observed no effect on follicle numbers
in the F0 dams and an ED50 of about 2 mg/kg/d in the Gclm
wild-type and heterozygous F1 offspring with 10 days of oral
dosing to the pregnant dam in the present study. Although
comparisons with earlier studies of BaP on ovarian follicle
destruction are complicated by their use of intraperitoneal
dosing (3–5), taken together, the results suggest that the period
of in utero development is the most sensitive to the ovotoxicity
of BaP, followed by the peripubertal period, with adults being
least sensitive. In a previous study, oral gavage of CD-1 dams
with 10 mg/kg/d BaP during the same dosing window that we
used in the present study caused about a 50% decrease in pup
production by female offspring (14). In contrast, we observed a
96% reduction in pup production in the wild-type 10 mg/kg/d
BaP-treated F1 females. This is consistent with earlier reports
that C57BL/6 mice are more sensitive to the peripubertal
ovarian toxicity of BaP than other strains (3, 4, 41). An alternate
explanation is that the Gclm heterozygosity of the mothers may
have contributed to the increased ovarian toxicity of the
transplacental exposure compared with the earlier study. In
the future, this could be tested by transferring embryos from
heterozygous dams mated with heterozygous males to pseudopregnant wild-type recipients, then treating the recipient
dams with BaP. Treatment with the PAH DMBA destroyed
small follicles in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human

ovarian explants that were implanted subcutaneously in mice
(50), showing that human ovarian follicles are susceptible to
PAH-induced destruction.
Our ﬁndings show that the PAH BaP is a transplacental
ovarian tumorigen, which causes mainly epithelial ovarian
tumors in mice. Furthermore, deﬁciency of GSH due to deletion of Gclm increases sensitivity to premature ovarian failure
and ovarian tumorigenesis induced by in utero exposure to
BaP. These ﬁndings have broader implications because human
exposure to BaP and other PAHs is ubiquitous and known
human polymorphisms in GCLC and GCLM may deﬁne a
sensitive subpopulation of women at greater risk for ovarian
toxicity and tumorigenesis from early life exposures to PAHs.
