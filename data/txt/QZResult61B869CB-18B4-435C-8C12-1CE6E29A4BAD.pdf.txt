Abstract
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue
sarcoma in children. Highly malignant, RMS frequently fails to
respond to conventional aggressive multimodal radiation,
surgery, and chemotherapy treatment protocols that also
cause significant sequelae in the growing child. Other tumors
of mesenchymal origin, such as locally aggressive fibromatoses and desmoid tumors, have been successfully treated with
a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, tamoxifen. In
an effort to identify new targets for RMS therapy, our group
investigated the previously uncharacterized ER pathway in
RMS cell culture and primary tumors. We detected ER isoform
B (ERB), but not isoform A, RNA, and protein in five RMS cell
lines. Immunohistochemical staining of primary RMS tumor
sections confirmed high levels of ERB but not ERA protein.
RMS cell growth was dramatically inhibited in steroid-free
conditions, and this growth inhibition was rescued with 17-Bestradiol (E2) supplementation. Exposure of RMS cells to
4¶OH-tamoxifen (4OHT) decreased cell viability and inhibited
colony formation as detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and colony-forming assays.
4OHT also induced apoptotic signaling in RMS cells as
detected by cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. This effect increased 3- to 8-fold in steroid-deprived
conditions but was rescued by supplementation with E2.
Immunofluorescence studies detected a change in the subcellular localization of ERB in response to 4OHT. Together, these
data suggest an active ERB-mediated signal transduction
pathway in RMS. The ability of 4OHT to induce apoptotic
signaling and disrupt estradiol-mediated proliferation provides a rationale to explore a role for selective ER modulators
in the treatment of RMS. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3476–85]

Introduction
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue
sarcoma of childhood, accounting for f10% of all solid tumors in
children (1). RMS is thought to arise from immature mesenchymal
cells already committed to the skeletal muscle lineage, and has two
major histologic subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS),
both demonstrating metastatic potential (2, 3). ERMS, the most
common RMS subtype, generally has an earlier age of onset and is

associated with a more favorable prognosis (2, 3). ARMS,
characterized by either t(1;13) or t(2;13) translocations, is often
resistant to current multimodal treatment protocols, providing
strong rationale to explore new therapeutic targets. Although much
is understood about paracrine and autocrine growth factor
signaling pathways in RMS (4–11), very little is known about the
influence of endocrine hormone activity on the development and
growth of this sarcoma. Here, we investigate the role of the
previously unexplored estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathway in
both histologic subtypes of RMS.
For >30 years, the clinical observations that up to 80% of
aggressive fibromatoses and desmoid tumors, two locally aggressive mesenchymal tumors, occur in women in their child-bearing
years has led to postulations of a role for elevated estrogens and ER
signaling in the development and growth of these tumors (12, 13).
Furthermore, multiple reports of remission of desmoid tumors in
response to treatment with a selective ER modulator, tamoxifen
(12, 14, 15), have resulted in more commonplace use of the
antiestrogenic agent in the treatment of these fibroblastic
neoplasms. Although the clinical evidence for an active ER pathway
in these tumors has recently been bolstered by findings of strong
ER expression profiles in desmoid tumors (16, 17), little other
experimental or mechanistic evidence exists to support the current
hypothesis of estrogen sensitivity.
The ER Family is a subset of the type I Steroid Receptor
Superfamily of nuclear receptors, which also includes receptors for
progesterone, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgens
(18, 19). The two major ER isoforms, ERa and ERh (595 and
530 amino acids, respectively), are encoded by genes located on
different chromosomes (6q and 14q, respectively). Shown to be
distinct receptors with similar DNA and ligand-binding patterns,
ER isoforms a and h exhibit different transcriptional activation
profiles in response to many agonists and antagonists (18, 20, 21).
The ER pathway is stimulated by estrogens and inhibited by
selective ER modulators, such as tamoxifen, opening up new
therapeutic options in ER-positive tumors. In this study, we explore
the potential existence of an active ER pathway in biologically
aggressive, mesenchyme-derived RMS, and test the hypothesis that
selective ER modulators have therapeutic potential for the
treatment of RMS.

penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 0.1% Fungizone (Invitrogen).
For experiments performed in steroid-free conditions, phenol red–free
(prf)DMEM + 10% charcoal stripped serum (CSS; Wisent, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-Glutamine (Invitrogen) was used. 17-h-estradiol
(E2) was used as an ER agonist, whereas selective ER modulator 4¶OHtamoxifen (4OHT) was used as an ER antagonist, both obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich Canada and dissolved in ethanol. For Western blot experiments, either 4.0  105 cells per well (RH28), 2.5  105 cells per well (RH4,
RH18, RH30, and MCF7), or 2.0  105 cells per well (RD) were plated
overnight in 6-well plates before treatment. For 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assays, either
7  103 cells per well (RH28), 2.5  103 cells per well (RH18, RH30,
and MCF7), or 2  103 cells per well (RH4 and RD) were either plated in
96-well plates in the appropriately treated medium or treated after 24 h.
Reverse transcription PCR. Total RNA was extracted from five
RMS and two breast cancer cell lines using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit
according to manufacturer’s protocols. The Superscript II First Strand
DNA kit (Invitrogen) was used for reverse transcription to generate cDNA
according to manufacturer’s instructions. One microlitre of reverse
transcription reaction was used as a template for PCR with Amplitaq Gold
DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) using 35 cycles (ERa) or 33 cycles
(ERh). All thermal cycling was performed using the GeneAmp PCR System
9700 (Applied Biosystems). For ERa, an initial activation step of 10 min
at 94jC and 35 cycles of 45 s at 94jC, 45 s at 60jC, and 1 min at 72jC was
followed by 7 min at 72jC. For ERh, the initial activation step of 10 min
at 94jC and 33 cycles of 1 min at 94jC, 45 s at 55.5jC, and 1 min at 72jC
was followed by 10 min at 72jC. Specific primers were designed for ERa
(sense, 5¶-AAGAGCTGCCAGGCCTGCC-3¶ and antisense, 5¶-TTGGCAGCTCTCATGTCTCC-3¶) and ERh (sense, 5¶-TAGTGGTCCATCGCCAGTTAT-3¶
and antisense, 5¶-GGGAGCCACACTTCACCAT-3¶), and were used for the
PCR reaction along with a no template control tube for each series.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control gene for
normalization of input cDNA.
Antibodies. For immunohistochemistry, primary antibodies specific to
ERa and ERh were purchased from Novocastra and Abcam Ltd,
respectively. For Western blotting, primary antibodies specific to ERa and
ERh were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Novocastra,
respectively. Primary antibodies specific to cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (cPARP), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (pERK), and total ERK were purchased from Cell Signalling
Technology. Primary antibody specific to loading control vinculin was
purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, whereas primary antibody specific
to ERh for the purpose of immunofluorescence was purchased from Gentex.
Goat anti-Mouse IRDye 800 cw and Goat anti-Rabbit IRDye 680 cw (LI-COR
Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies for all Western blots
developed using the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System.
Western blot protein analysis. Whole cell lysates from 5 RMS cell
lines and 2 breast cancer cell lines were harvested using Lysis Buffer C
[50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 1% v/v Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
EDTA (pH 7.4)] + Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Tablets (Roche Applied
Science), and concentration of each lysate was determined using the
Bradford assay. For each experiment, equal protein samples (50–70 Ag) were
run on a 15% SDS-PAGE mini gel under reducing conditions. Protein
was transferred to a PolyScreen PVDF Hybridization Transfer Membrane
(Perkin-Elmer), which was blocked for 1 h in Odyssey Blocking Buffer
(LI-COR Biosciences), and then probed at 4jC overnight for the presence of
ERa, ERh, cleaved caspase-3, cPARP, or pERK using target-specific primary
antibodies. Vinculin was used as a loading control for normalization of
results. Membranes were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in
anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to 680 and
780 nm IR dyes, respectively, both purchased from LI-COR Biosciences. Blots
were scanned at wavelengths of 700 and 800 nm using the Odyssey Infrared
Imaging System from LI-COR Biosciences. Densitometry was performed
using the Odyssey Application Software Version 2.1 (LI-COR Biosciences).
For pERK Western blots, after scanning the membrane for pERK-1, the
membrane was stripped with a polyvinylidene difluoride–stripping buffer
[25 mmol/L glycine (pH 2.0) and 1.5% SDS] and reprobed for total ERK.

Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor
tissue from 12 patients diagnosed with RMS—four diagnosed as ARMS,
four as ERMS, two as pleomorphic RMS, and two RMS not otherwise
specified—was cut into 3-Am sections and mounted onto slides.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using the EnVision+ peroxidase
system (DAKO). Deparaffinized sections were microwaved in citrate buffer
then treated with hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase.
Sections were incubated with either mouse monoclonal antibodies against
ERa (clone 6F11; diluted 1:100) or ERh (clone 14C8; diluted 1:300), stained
with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), and counterstained
with hematoxylin. Both series included positive controls of both benign and
malignant breast tissue. Using a microscope, fields were then scored based
on the percentage of cells staining positive for the target protein, as well as
for the relative strength of stain in each cell.
Cell growth and proliferation assays. Cells from one breast cancer line
and five RMS cell lines were plated in 96-well plates in either DMEM or
phenol red–free DMEM containing the appropriate treatment. At 24, 48, 72,
or 96 h, the TACS MTT Reagent (R&D Systems), a tetrazolium dye that is
metabolized by cells to produce punctate, colored crystals, was added to
each well. After 4 h, a detergent reagent was added to the wells, and the
following day, the plate was read at a wavelength of 570 nm and a control
wavelength of 650 nm in the SpectraMAX 250 colorimetric plate reader
(Molecular Devices Corporation). Statistical analysis of all results was
performed using a two-sample Student’s t test, assuming equal variances,
with an a of 0.01. Results are presented as means F SE.
Soft agar assays. MCF7 (5  103) or RMS (RD, RH4, RH18, and RH30)
cells were suspended in a solution of 0.35% sterile agarose (Invitrogen) in
OPTIMEM I (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS and vehicle (sterile
ethanol), 5, or 10 Amol/L 4OHT. Cultures were incubated for 3 wk, and once
weekly, 500 AL of OPTIMEM I supplemented with vehicle (sterile ethanol),
5, or 10 Amol/L 4OHT were added to the surface of the assays. The number
of colonies formed was counted using the average of two fields at
4 magnification, using a Leica Leitz DM IL phase-contrast microscope
(Leica Microsystems Canada).
Colony forming assays. MCF7 (5  103) or RMS (RD, RH4, RH18, and
RH30) cells were plated in 100-mm2 dishes, in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS and vehicle (sterile ethanol), 5, or 10 Amol/L 4OHT. Cultures were
incubated for 2 wk with one medium change and stained with 0.0025%
crystal violet at room temperature for 30 min. Colonies were counted
manually.
Statistical analysis of soft agar and colony forming assays. All data
for soft agar and colony-forming assays was analyzed using Graphpad Prism
3.0 (Graphpad Software, Inc.). Results are presented as means F SE. All
statistical analyses were performed with two-way ANOVA with post hoc
Tukey tests. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Immunofluorescence. Cells from one breast cancer line and two RMS
cell lines were plated on Poly-L-lysine–coated coverslips (BD Biosciences;
VWR) in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours after plating, medium containing
the appropriate treatment was added to each well. After another 24 h, cells
were fixed using 4% formaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.2%
Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were incubated in primary antibody against
ERh, incubated with a CY-3–tagged secondary antibody ( Jackson
ImmunoResearch), and then stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) nuclear stain (Molecular Probes). Cover slips were mounted on
slides, and images were captured by CCD camera coupled to a Leica
DMRA2 compound microscope equipped with standard epifluorescence
filters and Nomarski optics at 630 and 1,000 magnification.

Results
RMS primary tumors and cell lines express ERB but not ERA
isoform. To establish whether there is an active ER signaling
pathway in RMS, we first tested for the expression status of both ER
isoforms—ERa and ERh—in five RMS cell lines. Two breast cancer
cell lines were selected as experimental controls. The MCF-7 cell
line has been shown to express both ER isoforms (22, 23), whereas

T47D expresses ERa but not ERh (24). Total mRNA was extracted
from all cell lines, and reverse transcription-PCR was performed to
selectively amplify the gene of interest using primer pairs specific
to either ERa or ERh. All five RMS cell lines expressed ERh but
not ERa mRNA (Fig. 1A). We then measured ER expression at the
protein level, using whole cell protein lysates from the same cell
lines. Western blot analysis confirmed the same expression profiles
for both ERa and ERh in all cell lines tested (Fig. 1B).
To test for clinical relevance of our in vitro findings, we analyzed
12 primary RMS tumor samples by immunohistochemistry for the
relative expression of both ERa (Fig. 1C) and ERh (Fig. 1D). These
12 samples included both RMS histologic subtypes, ERMS (samples
1–4) and ARMS (samples 5–8), pleomorphic (samples 9 and 10)
and, other (samples 11 and 12). All 12 primary tumors stained
strongly positive for ERh, with 10 exhibiting expression in >50% of
the cells within any given field of view. In contrast, only 2 of the 12
samples stained positive for ERa. In these two cases, ERa staining
was weak, with only 10% to 30% of cells within any given field of
view expressing the protein. Tumor samples staining positive for
ERh exhibited predominantly nuclear localization of the protein.
ER agonist estradiol stimulates cell proliferation in RMS cell
lines. With ERh expression established in RMS cell lines, we next

examined whether the ER agonist (E2) could stimulate cell proliferation. When RMS cells were grown in steroid-free conditions
(prfDMEM/10% CSS), a highly significant decrease in cell proliferation of 50% to 90% (P < 0.005) was observed at 48 hours
(Fig. 2A). When steroid-free medium was supplemented with
100 nmol/L E2, which would represent a physiologic equivalent
level of circulating E2 (24), a significant 50% to 550% rescue of cell
proliferation (compared with steroid-free conditions) was observed
in all five RMS lines (Fig. 2A).
ER antagonist 4OHT inhibits RMS cell proliferation in vitro.
We next explored whether treatment with 4OHT, a selective ER
modulator and ER antagonist, could inhibit cell proliferation in
RMS. The breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was selected as a positive
control because inhibition of cell proliferation in response to clinically therapeutic dose levels of 4OHT has previously been shown
(25). Forty-eight hours after treatment of all RMS cell lines with
7.5 Amol/L 4OHT, a significant decrease in cell proliferation of 20%
to 90% (P < 0.005) was observed compared with control groups
(Fig. 2B). Similar and significant trends were seen using treatment
with both 5 and 10 Amol/L 4OHT (data not shown).
4OHT treatment inhibits RMS colony formation and
number in vitro. To examine the biological significance of

4OHT-induced inhibition of RMS cell growth and proliferation, we
performed colony formation assays in both treated soft agar and
treated culture medium. RMS cell lines RH4, RH18, RH30, and RD
were tested. For low numbers of RMS cells (5  103) after 3 weeks
of growth in 0.35% agar treated with OPTIMEM I (10% FBS)
medium containing vehicle (sterile ethanol), 5, or 10 Amol/L 4OHT,
a significant and dramatic reduction in the number of colonies
formed by 4OHT-treated RMS cell lines was observed (Fig. 3A).
These reductions in colony number ranged from 30% to 70% in
5 Amol/L 4OHT and up to 75% to 95% in 10 Amol/L 4OHT. For low
numbers of the same RMS cell lines (5  103) after 2 weeks of
growth in DMEM (10% FBS) medium containing vehicle (sterile
ethanol), 5, or 10 Amol/L 4OHT, a dramatic reduction in the
number of colonies formed by 4OHT-treated RMS cells was shown
(Fig. 3B). These reductions in colony number ranged from a 35%
to 90% in 5 Amol/L 4OHT and up to 75% to 99% reductions in
10 Amol/L 4OHT when compared with the vehicle control. MCF-7
was used as a positive control for both experiments. RMS cell line
RH28 was not tested due to its poor ability to form colonies when
plated in small numbers.

response to 4OHT treatment were due to induction of apoptosis,
we treated all five RMS lines with 4OHT and performed Western
blot analysis to determine whether apoptotic markers were
induced. Cleavage of caspase-3 was used as an indicator of early
apoptotic signaling, and relative activation of the protein was
measured in response to treatment of cells with 4OHT. Increases
(1.8–5-fold) in cleaved caspase-3 were detected in a dosedependent response to treatment with 4OHT in the MCF-7–
positive control and in all five RMS cell lines (Fig. 4A).
We next verified these findings by examining the effect of 4OHT
on a second indicator of apoptotic signaling, cPARP. In this
experiment, it was possible to discern differences in apoptotic
induction between additional concentrations of 4OHT, likely due to
the fact that PARP cleavage is a late apoptotic event, and because
it is further downstream in the apoptotic cascade, may be subject
to some degree of signal amplification. Increases (1.5–8-fold) in
PARP cleavage were observed in a dose-dependent curve according
to the concentration of 4OHT added (Fig. 4B).
Treatment with 4OHT in steroid-free conditions induces
high levels of apoptotic signaling that can be rescued with E2
supplementation in RMS cell lines. To explore the effect of
removing steroids from the growth medium on activation of the
apoptotic pathway in RMS cell lines, both in the presence and

absence of antiestrogens, Western blot analysis of the apoptotic
marker cPARP was performed. All results were normalized against
a DMEM/10% FBS control set to one, and plotted on a log order
graph (Fig. 5A). Removal of steroids from the medium resulted in
2- to 2.5-fold increase in cPARP in all RMS lines. When 4OHT was
added to the steroid-free medium, a dose-dependent 6- to 50-fold
increase in cPARP was observed for all cell lines. On average, the
dose-dependent curve resulting from 4OHT exposure was 3 to 6
times greater in steroid-free conditions (Fig. 5A) than had been
observed in DMEM/10% FBS medium (Fig. 4B). Similar trends were
observed in apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 in both DMEM
control and steroid-free conditions (data not shown).
We next tested whether this dramatic increase in activation of
the apoptotic pathway in steroid-free conditions could be rescued
back to the levels observed in RMS cells grown in regular growth
medium simply by resupplementing cells with E2. The relative
levels of PARP cleavage were investigated under both steroid-free
and E2-supplemented conditions (Fig. 5B). When steroids were
removed from the medium, PARP cleavage increased 4- to 10-fold
at higher 4OHT concentrations, but when cells were supplemented
with E2, this increase in activation of the apoptotic pathway was
rescued back to the levels observed for the DMEM control groups
(data shown is for the RD cell line). This trend was also observed in
RMS cell lines RH30 and RH28, and a similar trend was observed

for the cleavage of caspase-3 in all cell lines tested (data not
shown).
Treatment with 4OHT changes the subcellular localization
of ERB in RMS cell lines. To explore possible mechanism by which
4OHT treatment affects RMS cell lines, we performed immunofluorescence to investigate whether subcellular ERh localization is
affected by exposure to 4OHT. In untreated cultures growing in
DMEM with 10% FBS, ERh localization was observed to be predominantly nuclear (with some cytoplasmic signal) in RH30 cells
(Fig. 6). These findings were in keeping with immunohistochemical
observations made in the 12 primary RMS samples (Fig. 1D).
However, in RH30 cells treated with 4OHT for 24 hours, ERh was
primarily perinuclear in location. 4OHT-treated RH30 cells were
photographed at 1,000 due to a decrease in cell number per field
of view, resulting from exposure to 4OHT. Similar results were
observed with the RH4 line, and at concentrations of 5 and
10 Amol/L 4OHT (data not shown).

Discussion
Although paracrine and autocrine growth factor signaling—
including pathways activated by epidermal growth factor (6),

et al. (16) have recently identified ERa and ERh expression in
desmoid tumors, the activity of ER signaling in tumors of mesenchymal origin, including the sarcomas, has yet to be elucidated.
Furthermore, ERh may play an important role in a variety of
cancers with recent reports of significant ERh expression profiles
being shown in human bladder cancer (26), prostate cancer
(27, 28), salivary gland adenocarcinoma (29), astrocytic cancers
(30), and colonic adenocarcinoma (31).
Our experiments have shown, for the first time, the presence of
ERh and lack of ERa expression in RMS primary tumor samples
and cell lines, as well as a functional, estrogen-sensitive signaling
pathway. This pathway is also shown to be responsive to both ER
agonists and antagonists, and is capable of inducing proliferation
or activating apoptotic signaling in RMS cell lines under both
normal and steroid-free conditions. A recent report by Gruvberger-

www.aacrjournals.org

Saal et al. (32) demonstrating that for patients with ERa-negative
breast carcinomas, ERh expression is a predictive marker for
tamoxifen response and an independent marker for favorable
prognosis after adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, further highlights
the clinical relevance of these findings.
It should be noted that no differences were observed between
ARMS and ERMS cell lines with respect to their responses to
treatment with E2 and 4OHT, and that the effects observed did not
seem to be related to the relative level of ERh expression in each line.
Additional studies are necessary to determine if ERh-mediated
regulation of tumor cell growth and survival occurs in other ERh
expressing tumors, and whether clinical testing for ERh expression
may be a useful tool for determining whether adjuvant antiestrogenic therapy could be relevant for the treatment of previously
unconsidered tumor types.
A role for ERB in RMS cell growth. Here, we show, for the first
time, that multiple RMS tumor samples and cell lines express an

active ER. Although Zacharin et al. (33) previously speculated about
the importance of hormones, including estrogen, on an RMS tumor
that recurred after 25 years, directly following the patient’s
commencement of hormone therapy, this is the first study to
show a functional and estrogen-sensitive signaling pathway in both
ARMS and ERMS models in vitro.
Our data shows that removal of steroids from growth medium
results in a dramatic decrease in RMS cell growth and proliferation,
and a 2-2.5 fold increase in markers of apoptotic induction. This
effect can be significantly rescued by E2 supplementation. It is
important to note that the remaining discrepancy in cell growth
observed in several RMS cell lines between those groups partially
rescued from steroid-free conditions with E2 supplementation, and
those grown in regular growth medium (Fig. 2A) is suggestive of a
role for steroid hormones other than estrogens in the growth of
RMS cells. Such factors likely account for the only partial rescue of
cell growth in RH4, RH18, and RD and would be in keeping with
the recent findings of Ishizuka et al. (16), which suggest that
desmoid tumors, of similar ontogeny to RMS, express a variety of
steroid hormone receptors, including progesterone and androgen
receptors.

In contrast to the increased proliferation induced by resupplementation of E2, treatment with an antiestrogen, 4OHT, resulted in
decreased proliferation of RMS cells. These results were dramatic
and highly significant (P = 0.0039–0.000022), ranging from 20%
to 90% reductions in RMS cell growth at 24-, 48-, and 72-hour time
points. In most RMS cell lines, the decrease in proliferation
observed after 4OHT treatment was comparable with that shown
for breast cancer cell line MCF-7, one of the first cell lines on which
tamoxifen treatment was successfully tested. Previous studies by
Wakeling et al. (25) have shown f50% reductions in MCF-7 growth
in vitro in response to 4OHT treatment. This effect was comparable
with that observed in our experiments with MCF-7.
The in vitro studies of the ability of tamoxifen to inhibit MCF-7
proliferation (25) were subsequently confirmed in vivo in a study
that showed 4OHT-induced inhibition of MCF-7 xenograft tumor
growth in a mouse model (34). Our in vitro tests of the biological
significance of tamoxifen-induced RMS growth inhibition showed
significant and dramatic reductions in the ability of RMS cell lines
to form colonies in either soft agar or growth medium. Reductions
in RMS colony number ranged from 35% to 99% (depending on the
cell line and tamoxifen concentration used) and confirmed the

An Active Estrogen Receptor Pathway in RMS

Figure 6. Impact of 4OHT on the
subcellular localization of ERh in RMS cell
lines. Cells from RMS line RH30 were
plated on poly-L-lysine–coated coverslips in
DMEM/10% FBS; at 24 h, new medium
containing vehicle (sterile ethanol), 5, 7.5,
or 10 Amol/L 4OHT was added; at 48 h,
cells were fixed, permeabilized, and
incubated with a specific antibody against
ERh. Cells were then incubated with
Cy-3–tagged secondary antibodies and a
DAPI nuclear stain, mounted on slides,
and images at 630 magnification were

importance of the effect of tamoxifen on RMS cells in a more
biologically relevant system.
Thus, based on the success of tamoxifen in the treatment of
breast cancer after inhibition of MCF-7 xenograft growth in mouse
models (34), our in vitro results with RMS growth suppression and
inhibition of colony formation in soft agar and growth medium
provide a solid rationale for future analysis of antiestrogen therapy
for this type of tumor.
Tamoxifen-mediated induction of the apoptotic pathway in
RMS. Our data shows that the ER pathway in RMS can be modified
with the antiestrogen 4OHT, which not only inhibits cell
proliferation and colony formation but also induces apoptotic
signaling in both the presence and absence of steroids. Tamoxifen
and its derivatives are most commonly associated with inhibition
of cell growth (35), and findings of 4OHT-induced apoptosis are
uncommon but not unprecedented. A recent study has shown
that tamoxifen is capable of inducing dose-dependent effects on
apoptosis and proliferative arrest when added to growth medium
used to culture mesenchyme–derived chondrocytes in rat metatarsal bones (36). An additional study by Wu et al. (37) has shown a
similar dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in another mesenchyme-derived cell type, murine osteoclasts. Cumulatively, these
studies are supported by the many clinical case reports in which
tamoxifen has induced rapid regression of desmoid tumors,
although little mechanistic evidence is provided (12, 14, 15, 38).
Here, we report the identification of a targeted therapeutic agent
that decreases cellular growth and activates the apoptotic pathway
in RMS tumor cells but has not been shown to induce gross cytotoxic effects in ER-negative cells even after extensive clinical use.
This finding may prove to be of significant relevance for reducing
off-target effects and toxicity in the future treatment of RMS.
The fact that removal of steroids from growth medium resulted
in dramatic increases in the susceptibility of RMS cells to 4OHTinduced activation of apoptosis pathways suggests a possible
degree of protection conferred on RMS cells by one or more steroid
hormones. However, these dramatic increases in apoptotic

signaling could be rescued back to control levels by E2 supplementation. This observation is likely due to competitive binding
between E2 and 4OHT as explored by Barkhem et al. (39), confirming ERh as a specific target of 4OHT in RMS cells. Changes in
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation and
cellular localization of ERh in response to 4OHT were also
observed and provide potential insight into mechanistic explanations for the results obtained (data not shown).
Finally, all of these findings of 4OHT-induced activation of
apoptosis pathways were shown in an ERh-positive/ERa-negative
tumor model, providing new insights into the poorly defined
activity of ERh in tumor growth.
Potential mechanisms for tamoxifen-induced proliferative
inhibition and apoptosis in RMS. The nuclear to cytoplasmic
change in subcellular localization of ERh after exposure of RMS cell
lines to the ER antagonist 4OHT observed here is consistent with a
model in which ER antagonists disrupt genomic ER signaling
(which takes place in the nucleus) and induce changes in nongenomic, ERK-mediated cascades (which occur in the cytoplasm).
Several studies have previously shown that nuclear localization of
ERs in response to E2 stimulation can be disrupted in ERaexpressing cells by treatment with pure ERa antagonist ICI 182,780
(40, 41). This results in an induced cytoplasmic localization of
ERa in contrast to its normal and predominantly nuclear location,
likely due to a relative increase in nuclear export of the receptor
(40, 41). Although this effect was not observed after treatment with
tamoxifen in these experiments, tamoxifen is a partial agonist of
ERa (42) but a pure antagonist of ERh (39), explaining the changes
in ERh localization observed in RMS cells. Changes in the activation of MAPK pathway kinases have also been implicated in the
regulation of ER nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (41).
A tamoxifen-induced apoptotic pathway that both induces and
is dependent on ERK phosphorylation has recently been described
in detail for both ERa and ERh-expressing MCF-7 and T47D breast
cancer cells (43). Experiments with several RMS cell lines (RD and
RH18) also showed up to 2-fold increases in ERK-1 phosphorylation

at the time points at which the highest levels of tamoxifen-induced
apoptosis were observed (data not shown). Further studies to
determine the outcome, role, and significance of ERK-1 phosphorylation in the RMS response to both E2 and tamoxifen may help to
elucidate the importance of this pathway for both RMS proliferation and apoptosis.
Sex steroid hormones in sarcoma development. RMS has two
major histologic subtypes each with a distinct age of onset. ERMS,
the embryonal version of this tumor, generally presents in children
ages <6 years, with some 35% of RMS cases occurring in the first 4
years of life, and as many as 10% occurring in the neonatal period
(2, 3, 44). ARMS, the more aggressive subtype, is more typically seen
in early to midadolescence. Elevated levels of hormone expression
associated with these age groups—maternal estrogen in fetal
development and sex hormones during adolescence—might
contribute to the onset of RMS through endocrine steroid signaling.
Other examples of this potentially hormone-related pattern of onset
in tumors of similar lineage include fibrosarcoma, with an infantile
(<2 years) and adult (10–15 years) age of onset (2, 3, 45). Together,
these observations may provide further rationale for exploring the
influence of steroid signaling in tumors of mesenchymal origin.
Additionally, the exploration of a potential role for ERs in the

differentiation of normal skeletal myoblasts warrants investigation
in light of findings that differential ERa and especially ERh
expression patterns have been linked to the process of differentiation in osteoblasts (46) and osteoclasts (47), both of which are
derived from the same mesenchymal progenitor cells as myoblasts.
Our findings provide new insight into the relatively poorly
understood mechanisms of ERh activity in both RMS and other
ER-positive tumor types. Furthermore, the evidence of estrogen
sensitivity and tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in RMS cell lines
constitutes a compelling rationale for further study of the ER
pathway as a therapeutic target in RMS, as well as other mesenchymally derived sarcomas, as a potential synergistic or adjuvant
treatment to be used in conjunction with current chemotherapy
protocols.
