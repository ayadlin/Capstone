ABSTRACT
Proteomic analysis of ionomycin-treated and untreated mammary epithelial
MCF10A cells elucidated differences in Ku80 cleavage. Ku80, a subunit of the Ku
protein complex, is an initiator of the non-homologous, end-joining (NHEJ), doublestrand breaks (DSBs) repair pathway. The nuclear Ku80 was cleaved in a calcium
concentration-dependent manner by m-calpain but not by m-calpain. The cleavage
of nuclear Ku80 at its a/b domain was validated by Western blotting analysis using
flag-tagged expression vectors of truncated versions of Ku80 and a flag antibody and
was confirmed in m-calpain knock-down cells and in vitro cell-free evaluation with
recombinant proteins of calpains, Ku70, and Ku80. In addition, the cleaved Ku80 still
formed a Ku heterodimer and promoted DNA DSB repair activity. Taken together, these
findings indicate that translocated m-calpain enhances the NHEJ pathway through
the cleavage of Ku80. Based on the present study, m-calpain in DNA repair pathways
might be a novel anticancer drug target, or its mechanism might be a possible route
for resistance acquisition of DNA damage-inducing chemotherapeutics.

pathway [8]. The most important difference between the
two pathways is cell-cycle dependency. HR is cell-cycle
specific because homologous DNA segments exist only
after DNA replication; therefore, HR has a low probability
of producing errors [9–12].
NHEJ is the main pathway in the repair of DSBs
because it repairs the DNA DSBs by ligating both ends
of the broken DNA. This pathway is less accurate than
HR, but it can operate throughout all phases of the cell
cycle [13, 14]. The initiator of NHEJ is the Ku complex,
which recognizes DNA DSB ends. The Ku complex exists
in mammalian cells but not in yeast and is a heterodimer
composed of two subunits, Ku70 (70 kDa) and Ku80 (80
kDa) [15]. Ku proteins play an important role in numerous
cellular processes including V(D)J (Variable-(Diversity)Joining) recombination, transcription, regulation of
heat shock proteins, and telomere maintenance [16,
17]. Furthermore, many reports have suggested that Ku
proteins have positive effects on the progression of cancer
cells. If Ku is deficient in cells, the aforementioned cellular

INTRODUCTION
There are many ways to treat cancers such as
interrupting cell division, targeting angiogenesis or growth
factors, and inhibiting synthesis of nucleic acids. Induction
of DNA damage and interference with DNA repair is one
of the preferred ways to prevent the proliferation of cancer
cells [1]. DNA can be damaged by endogenous oxidative
stress or exogenous toxic agents such as radiomimetic
drugs, ionizing radiation (IR), or ultraviolet (UV) light
[2–5]. When damaged, DNA might undergo some
chemical alterations such as strand breaking, crosslinking,
and the loss of bases [1]. Among these types of DNA
damage, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most
severe [1–5] due to the resulting reduction in genomic
stability, induction of chromosomal aberration, and loss
of genetic information, which eventually leads to cell
death [6, 7]. In eukaryotes, there are two major DNA DSB
repair pathways, the homologous recombination (HR)
pathway and the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)

of blood vessels than does m-calpain, whereas m-calpain
has a larger effect on migration and angiogenesis [54, 55].
Thus, demonstrating their specific roles could be a key
factor in the development of effective anti-cancer drugs.
In the present study, we hypothesized that
translocated m-calpain affects DNA processes such as
replication, damage, and repair based on a literature search
(Tables S1-S3). We found that m-calpain translocated as
the result of calcium influx was involved in DNA DSB
repair, especially in the NHEJ pathway through proteolysis
of nuclear Ku80 but not Ku70. We also elucidated that
cleaved Ku80 was still able to form a heterodimer with
Ku70 and enhance DNA repair activity. Taken together,
these results suggest that the mechanism of m-calpain in
DNA repair pathways might be used as a novel anticancer
drug target or a possible route for resistance acquisition of
DNA damage-inducing chemotherapeutics.

processes cannot be performed properly, and cells undergo
tumorigenesis [17–19]. After DNA damage occurs,
the Ku complex binds to DNA break ends and recruits
NHEJ proteins such as DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK)
[20]. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of the
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway
enhances the NHEJ pathway through the activation of
DNA-PKcs [21, 22].
Although the induction of DNA damage is the
main treatment for cancer, it can promote carcinogenesis
by damaging normal cells, to which the majority of the
adverse effects of anticancer therapy are attributed.
Moreover, the DNA process is easily affected by cell
cycle-related proteins and apoptosis regulators [23, 24];
therefore, it is very important to control DNA damage and
to repair it properly in order to minimize side effects.
Recent studies have suggested that calpains are one
of these DNA process-regulating proteins because it has
been demonstrated that m-calpain but not μ-calpain can
translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus. Translocated
m-calpain proteolyzes topoisomerase I, which produces
DNA topological problems during the cell cycle. The
relaxation activity of topoisomerase I is greater when it is
truncated by m-calpain [24]. Calpains belong to the family
of calcium-dependent cytoplasmic cysteine proteases; due
to the high calcium level in cancer cells resulting from
the low buffering system, calpains are easily activated to
process toward survival [25–29]. Among 15 human calpain
isoforms, calpains 1 (μ-calpain) and 2 (m-calpain), named
after the respective micromolar and millimolar calcium
concentrations required for their full activation in vitro, are
expressed ubiquitously and have been the most intensively
studied [30, 31]. Calpain uses various proteins as substrates;
therefore, we attempted to classify the substrates of mcalpain in order to understand its diverse roles. First,
calpain regulates transcription through the proteolysis of
transcription factors such as nucleolin, IkBa, and histone
2B [32–34]. Second, calpain has effects on cell motility
and adhesion by cleaving cytoskeletal proteins such as
spectrin, tubulin, and filamin [35–45]. In addition, there are
many signaling proteins and apoptosis regulators such as
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), Bax, Bid, and caspases that
act as calpain substrates, suggesting that calpain is likely
involved in apoptosis and cellular survival [35, 46–50].
In addition, it is also involved in angiogenesis by altering
blood coagulation proteins such as fibrinogen and kininogen
[51] (Tables S1-S3 in Supplementary Information).
Although not fully understood, it seems
very important to define the unique roles of each
calpain isoform, because where and which calpain is
overexpressed can differ according to cancer type. For
instance, both μ- and m-calpain are closely involved in
the invasion of lung cancer. However, it has also been
shown that m-calpain is more involved in the invasion of
prostate cancer than is μ-calpain [52, 53]. Furthermore,
μ-calpain plays a larger role in the apoptosis and regression

RESULTS
Calcium influx-mediated translocation of
m-calpain from the cytosol to the nucleus
attenuates ERK in MCF10A cells
Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that
translocation of the cytosolic protein m-calpain to the
nucleus was induced by calcium influx (Figure 1A).
m-Calpain was located in the cytosol in untreated
MCF10A cells. While it clearly translocated from the
cytosol to the nucleus when treated for 2 hours with an
ionomycin concentration of 0.75 μM or higher. Ionomyci,
an ionophore, was used to increase the level of intracellular
calcium. Thus, activated m-calpain can affect nuclear
proteins involved in cellular processes occurring in the
nucleus such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription
(Tables S1-S3). To verify the effect of Ca2+ influxmediated translocated m-calpain on nuclear proteins,
nuclear extracts of ionomycin-treated and untreated cells
were prepared and analyzed using two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis (2-DE). In comparison with untreated
MCF10A cells, intensities of 10 DE-labeled spots of the
treated cells were decreased more than two-fold, and two
spots labeled JD were no longer present. In addition, 10
spots were intensified more than two-fold and were thus
named IN spots. The three newly appeared spots were
labeled JI (Figure 1B). These spots changed dramatically
upon treatment with 1 μM ionomycin for 2 hours and
were further analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The
results are summarized in Tables 1-3. As we expected,
cytoskeletal proteins such as talin, actin, and filamin
were shown to be the most influenced by calcium influx,
because calpain cleaves a substantial number of such
cytoskeletal and structural proteins (Table S1). Moreover,
the expressions of heat shock proteins and RNA-binding
proteins such as ribonucleoprotein K were changed with
the calcium level. Among these proteins, we focused on

large ERK kinase in the DE03 spot. As mentioned earlier,
ERK kinase has been reported to be involved in the DNA
repair pathway by enhancing the NHEJ pathway [21, 22].
Taken together, these results led us to hypothesize that the
DNA repair pathway, especially the NHEJ pathway, is
affected by change in intracellular calcium level.

To verify the identity of the enzyme that cleaved
nuclear Ku80, we treated the cells with calpeptin prior
to treatment with 0.75 μM ionomycin since a previous
study had reported that m-calpain was translocated from
the cytosol to the nucleus after activation by calcium
[24]. Calpeptin is a well-known, cell-permeable calpain
inhibitor and synthetic peptidomimetic aldehyde moietyconteining molecule. The calpain inhibitory activity of
calpeptin was reported as 0.04 μM of the IC50 value in
platelets [58]. As shown in Figure 2D, cytosolic Ku70 and
Ku80 and nuclear Ku70 were not changed by co-treatment
with ionomycin and calpeptin. However, nuclear Ku80
was cleaved upon treatment with ionomycin, as seen in
Figure 2A, and the extent of proteolysis was decreased by
calpeptin treatment in a concentration-dependent manner.
This data suggests that calpain is the main enzyme causing
cleavage of nuclear Ku80.

Ionomycin-induced cleavage of nuclear Ku80 in
MCF10A cells is blocked by calpeptin, a calpain
inhibitor
Our observation of ERK attenuation induced by
abnormally increased levels of intracellular calcium
(Figure 1B and Table 1), in combination with a literature
study of the relationship between ERK and NHEJ, led
us to hypothesize that NHEJ is enhanced by calcium
influx [21]. Further, previous studies have shown that
the expression of Ku proteins, the initiators of the NHEJ
pathway, were altered by oxidative stress in the nucleus
but not in the cytosol, and that Ku80 in particular was
cleaved by some proteases [56, 57]. Therefore, we decided
to further clarify the effects of calcium influx on Ku70
and Ku80 by identifying their expression levels in the
cytosol and nucleus. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, the
expression levels of Ku70 and Ku80 were not affected
by calcium influx in the cytosol, nor was that of nuclear
Ku70. However, Ku80 in the nucleus was proteolyzed
by calcium influx in a calcium concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 2C). This data supports the notion that
Ku80 is cleaved by enzymes activated by calcium.

Recombinant m-calpain cleaves only Ku80, not
Ku70, in the presence of calcium
Recombinant μ- and m-calpains were activated
with calcium in calpain assay buffer and reacted with
recombinant Ku70 and Ku80 as substrates. After
performing cell-free assays, it was evident that Ku70 was
not the substrate of either μ-calpain or m-calpain. Ku80,
however, was proteolyzed by m-calpain but not by μcalpain (Figure 3A). Therefore, it is clear that m-calpain
cleaves only Ku80, and that Ku80 is the specific substrate
of m-calpain.

Figure 1: A. Cytosolic m-calpain was translocated to the nucleus by Ca2+ influx in MCF10A cells. An immunofluorescence assay using

confocal microscopy revealed that ionomycin treatment led to translocation of cytosolic m-calpain to the nucleus. The nucleus was stained
with DAPI, and m-calpain was indicated by an Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated secondary antibody. B. Changes upon ionomycin treatment
of MCF10A cells were analyzed by 2-DE and MS. Nuclear extracts of MCF10A cells, after treatment with or without 1 μM ionomycin
for 2 hours, were prepared by the cellular fractionation method. Following electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250.

cells. These results confirm that m-calpain is the key
enzyme causing the proteolysis of nuclear Ku80 upon
calcium influx.

there were two bands in the ionomycin-treated MCF10A
cell immunoprecipitates, with the sizes of the detected
proteins matching the sizes of the cleavage products of
Ku80 shown in previous studies (Figure 5). Therefore, it
was concluded that cleaved Ku80 can dimerize with Ku70
in the same manner as full-length Ku80.

m-Calpain cleaves the α/β domain of Ku80
The 293FT cells separately transfected with the
α/β domain (N-terminus of Ku80) and the carboxy
helical domain (C-terminus of Ku80) were analyzed
following incubation with or without ionomycin to
verify the cleavage region of Ku80. Prior to treatment
with ionomycin, a 15 hour transfection was set as the
most efficient time by monitoring the extent of protein
expression encoded by the transfected genes with an
anti-flag antibody (Figure 4A). Figure 4B shows that
the carboxy domain of Ku80 was not altered by calcium
influx; however, the α/β domain of Ku80 was diminished
by calcium influx. These data demonstrate that the
cleavage site of Ku80 for m-calpain is located in the
N-terminal region of Ku80, called the α/β domain.

Cleaved Ku80 enhances the repair activity of
adriamycin-mediated DNA damage
Although cleaved Ku80 was shown to form a
heterodimer with Ku70, additional experiments were
performed to determine its effects on DNA repair activity.
In order to identify the biological implications of mcalpain-mediated cleavage of Ku80 on DNA repair, we
induced DNA damage with adriamycin treatment and
then activated m-calpain with ionomycin treatment in
order to cleave Ku80. In addition, we treated the cells
with calpeptin to inhibit m-calpain activation. Firstly,
the expression of γ-H2AX was observed at 3, 6, and 9
hours after m-calpain activation. When mammalian cells
undergo DNA damage, histones are phosphorylated to
γ-H2AX, a widely used marker of DNA damage [59].
As shown in Figure 6A, the expression of γ-H2AX was
increased upon treatment with adriamycin, and the extent
of this increased expression was decreased by treatment
with ionomycin. However, the increased expression level
of γ-H2AX by adriamycin was maintained upon treatment
with calpeptin. These results imply that m-calpain,
activated by calcium influx, ameliorates DNA repair and
decreases adriamycin efficacy. In addition, a comet assay

Cleaved Ku80 forms a heterodimer with Ku70
In order to investigate the function of cleaved Ku80,
immunoprecipitation was performed. Based on previous
reports that Ku70 and Ku80 form a heterodimer, a Ku70
antibody was used to precipitate the immune complex, and
Western blotting was performed with a Ku80 antibody. In
untreated cells, one band of approximately 80 kDa was
detected, corresponding to full-length Ku80. However,

DISCUSSION

was performed to identify the extent of the DNA damage.
The comet assay is a sensitive method for the detection of
DNA damage in individual cells [60]. The extent of the
tail formation is regarded as the extent of DNA damage.
As shown in Figure 6B and 6C, neither ionomycin nor
calpeptin alone induced DNA damage, while treatment
with 3 μM adriamycin induced a comet tail. A comet tail
was rarely seen in combined treatment with ionomycin
and adriamycin in MCF10A cells. When calpeptin was cotreated with adriamycin and ionomycin, the comet tail was
restored to a similar extent to that induced by adriamycin.
These results confirm the positive effect of m-calpainmediated Ku80 cleavage on DNA repair activity.

It is known that μ- and m-calpains participate
in several cellular processes such as transcription,
apoptosis, maintenance of cellular structure, and
carcinogenesis [29–31, 52]. The proteolytic activity of μand m-calpains against diverse substrate proteins must be
tightly controlled, as their abnormal activation has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases such as
Alzheimer’s disease, muscular dysfunction, myocardial
infarct, and tumor progression [26-31, 35, 47-49, 53, 55].
However, calpain isotype-specific cleavage of nuclear
proteins and its biological importance and roles in the

pathogenesis associated with diseases remain incompletely
investigated. The insufficient or imprecise understanding
of calpain isotype-specific functions might be due to the
structural similarity of substrate-binding catalytic sites in
μ- and m-calpains and a lack of stable and potent isotypespecific inhibitors available for in vivo experiments [30,
61]. We first attempted to summarize a plethora of proteins
that are cleaved by m-calpain in order to better understand
the isoform-specific biological implications of m-calpain.
As listed in Tables S1-S3, translocated m-calpain affects
DNA processes including replication, damage, and repair;
however, no substrate related to DSBs repair has been
reported. It has however been reported that calcium influxactivated topoisomerase I proteolysis is caused by mcalpain translocation. Moreover, truncated topoisomerase
I exhibited an enhancement of DNA relaxation activity
compared with its full length, leading to a reduction in
camptothecin efficacy related to cell death [24]. In this
regard, the current study focused on the role of m-calpain
in DNA DSB repair. We found that ionomycin-activated
and translocated m-calpain induced substantial abatement
in the expression level of ERK kinase, as seen by 2D-gel
and MS analysis. Based on reports that the inhibition of
ERK kinase activation enhanced the NHEJ pathway of
DNA DSB repair through DNA-PKcs activation [21],

and that Ku proteins were downregulated and cleaved
by proteases under oxidative stress conditions [56, 57],
we evaluated the influence of ionomycin-activated mcalpain nuclear translocation on the NHEJ pathway of
DNA DSB repair through investigation of NHEJ pathwayrelated proteins. Ionomycin treatment activated and
translocated cytosolic m-calpain to the nucleus (Figure
1A). Translocated m-calpain cleaved nuclear Ku80 but not
Ku 70 (Figure 2A & 2C). Calpeptin, a calpain inhibitor,
blocked the cleavage of nuclear Ku80 (Figure 2D & 2F),
which was confirmed in m-calpain knockdown cells and
in in vitro cell-free μ- and m-calpain assays with purified
recombinant calpains and Ku proteins (Figure 3). This is
the first report of Ku80 as the specific substrate for mcalpain. We further determined the cleavage region of
Ku80 to be its α/β domain (Figure 4). When DSBs are
caused by various DNA-damaging agents such as IR,
chemotherapeutics, UV light, and radiotherapy, Ku70
and Ku80 form a heterodimer [18] and initiate the NHEJ
pathway by binding to both ends of DSBs, followed by
recruitment of other repair proteins such as DNA-PK,
XRCC4, and ligase IV [10, 11, 13, 14]. Ku proteins
consist of three subunits, an α/β domain, a β-barrel
domain, and a helical carboxy arm. The β-barrel domain,
the central part of Ku proteins, is involved in non-specific

Figure 6: Cleaved Ku80 enhanced the repair activity of DNA damaged caused by adriamycin. A. MCF10A cells were

treated with 5 μM of adriamycin for 1.5 hours, followed by treatment alone or combined with 0.75 μM ionomycin and 50 μM of calpeptin
in fresh media for the designated times. Cell lysates were then subjected to Western blotting. B. A comet assay was performed to evaluate
the effect of cleaved Ku80 on DNA repair following treatment of ionomycin, calpeptin, and adriamycin alone or co-treatment of ionomycinadriamycin and ionomycin-calpeptin-adriamycin. Tail extent was obtained with the lengths of the tail and head by analysis of images using
the Komet software. C. Columns and error bars indicate the mean ± SD (n = 50). ***p<0.001 shows a significant difference from the value
of adriamycin-treated cells. Adriamycin was used to cause DNA damage, and γ-H2AX was used as a marker of DNA damage. DNA damage
caused by adriamycin was more efficiently repaired under m-calpain activation conditions than under suppressed conditions.

binding to the DNA backbone. The α/β domain is at the
N-terminus of Ku proteins, and the helical C-terminal arm
is related to the binding to repair proteins. In particular,
the C-terminus of Ku proteins is involved in dimerization
and association with DNA-PKcs [18]. Therefore, cleavage
of the N-terminus of Ku80, caused by activated mcalpain in the nucleus, does not interfere with the ability
of Ku80 to form dimers with Ku70, as observed from
the immunoprecipitation analysis shown in Figure 5.
Although the extent of nuclear cleaved Ku80 by calcium
influx-activated m-calpain was not as high as that of intact
full-length nuclear m-calpain (Figure 2), nuclear cleaved
Ku80 reduced the adriamycin-induced DNA DSBs (Figure
6). Previously, it has been reported that Ku80 (732 aa)
is cleaved at the Asp-730 residue by caspase-3 during
apoptosis in Jurkat cells [62]. This caspase-3-mediated
C-terminal cleavage prevented Ku80 from associating
with DNA-PKcs because the C-terminus of Ku80 is the
binding site for DNA-PKcs. The repair of DNA DSBs was
eventually retarded during apoptosis [63]. The C-terminal
last two-residue cleaved form of Ku80 is distributed in
the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells, and the localization of
full-length Ku80 depends on the cell cycle. The full-length
form of Ku80 localizes in the nucleus in interphase, in the
cytoplasm during mitosis, and in the nucleus during late
telophase/early G1 phase [63, 64]. The Ku80 cleavage site
and localization seem to be very important for its DNA
repair function. The m-calpain-mediated Ku80 N-terminal
cleavage occurred and its cleaved form was retained in
the nucleus, while the Ku80 C-terminal-truncated by
caspase-3 was localized in the cytoplasm.
Improper repair of DBSs, the most lethal form of
DNA damage, can lead to chromosomal aberrations,
genetic instability, and cellular death [1–5]. NHEJ joins
the ends of DSBs regardless of the cell-cycle, indicating
that NHEJ is the most predominant DSB repair pathway,
especially for damage caused by IR and radiomimetic
drugs [1, 11, 12]. Therefore, the role of m-calpain in
NHEJ DNA repair through the cleavage of Ku80 in the
nucleus has to be cautiously considered during treatment
of DNA damage caused by anticancer drugs such as the
topoisomerase II-targeting drugs, adriamycin, etoposide,
and quinolones [65]. Adriamycin is considered to be the
most effective anticancer drugs in clinical use; however,
resistance is common, demonstrating a main disablement
to successful treatment. It has been previously reported
that adriamycin increased the intracellular calcium
concentration and ROS generation in rat cardiomyocytes
[66]. A higher calcium level has been observed in
adriamycin-resistant leukemia cells compared with
adriamycin-sensitive cells; however, the correlations
between intracellular free calcium concentration and
calmodulin content with induction of drug resistance
in leukemia cells have not been clearly defined [67].
Treatment with cepharanthine, a calcium antagonist, at
nontoxic concentrations moderately enhanced adriamycin

cytotoxicity against sensitive K562 and Ov2780 human
cancer cells, while a significant enhancement was observed
when resistant K562/ADM and AD 10 human tumor
cells were co-treated with cepharanthine and adriamycin
[68]. The results obtained in the current study, showing
that activation and translocation of m-calpain induced
by calcium influx cleaved nuclear Ku80 and reduced
adriamycin cytotoxicity, suggest a link between adriamycin
resistance and the high level of intracellular calcium
concentration in cells. The mechanism of drug resistance
is extremely complicated; therefore, our findings are not
a solid resolution to resistance. However, DNA damage
and repair are closely related to carcinogenesis, and our
proposed mechanism will be a novel way to approach
cancer therapy through the inhibition of calpain activation
in combination with radiomimetic chemotherapeutics.

proteins were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.
Membranes were again washed three times with TBST
every 20 minutes and detected with Power Opti-ECL
Western blotting detection reagent (Animal Genetics Inc.,
Korea) and West-Q Femto Clean ECL solution reagent
(GenDEPOT, USA). Western blot images were produced
using a LAS-3000 and ChemiDoc™ XRS and analyzed
using Multi-Gauge Software (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.,
Japan) and Image Lab™ Software (Biorad, USA),
respectively. Primary antibodies against Ku70, Ku80, and
histone were from Santa Cruz Biotech (CA), that against
γ-H2AX was from Abcam (USA), and those against mcalpain, β-actin, flag, and all secondary antibodies were
from Cell Signaling (USA). All primary antibodies were
diluted at a ratio of 1:1000, and secondary antibodies were
diluted at a ratio of 1:2000.

MCF10A cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 3200 rpm and room temperature for 3 minutes, and
the pellet was washed with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) in the same manner. The pellet was subsequently
resuspended in 200 μL of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, 10
mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),
and 0.5 mM PMSF adjusted to pH 7.5 with HCl) and
incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Then, 10% NP-40 was
added and vortexed for 10 seconds. The supernatant was
collected following centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12000
rpm and 4 °C, and the pellet was washed once with buffer
A in the same manner and resuspended in 50 μL of buffer
B (20 mM HEPES, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM
PMSF adjusted to pH 7.9 with HCl). Following incubation
on ice for 30 minutes, the supernatant was collected by
10-minute centrifugation at 12,000 rpm and 4 °C. The
supernatant was the nuclear extract and was stored at -20
°C until use.

Two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis and mass
spectrometry
Nuclear extracts of MCF10A cells untreated or
treated with 1 μM of ionomycin for 2 hours were prepared
using the same process as used for cellular fractionation
without the addition of buffer B. For electrophoresis,
nuclear extracts were lysed with two-dimensional
electrophoresis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea,
4%
3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1propanesulfonate (CHAPS), and 2.5% DTT and sonicated
for full lysis. Next, 700 μg of proteins of each prepared
nuclear extract were loaded and electrophoresed using
Immobiline™ DryStrip pH 3-10, 18 cm gels (GE
healthcare Life Sciences, USA). After electrophoresis, gels
were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. 2DE gels and
mass spectrometry for the prepared nuclear extracts were
performed by ProteomeTech (Korea).

Western blotting analysis
MCF10A cells were washed with PBS
and quickly trypsinized. The cells were lysed in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (RIPA lysis
buffer) solution containing 50 mM Tris, 1% NP-40,
0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% protease inhibitor
cocktail adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl. The lysate was
incubated on ice for 30 minutes and centrifuged for 20
minutes at 12,000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatant was then
collected and stored at -20 °C until use. The amount of
soluble protein in the lysate was determined using BCA™
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, USA). Next, 70 μg of proteins
were loaded for the detection of Ku70, Ku80, m-calpain,
histone, and β-actin, and 100 μg of proteins was loaded for
the detection of γ-H2AX. Samples were run on 10-15%
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a 0.2 μm polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation, USA) for the
detection of γ-H2AX and a 0.45 μm membrane for the
detection of the remaining proteins at 200 mA for 1 to 2
hours. The membranes were subsequently blocked with
5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature.
After washing the membranes three times with TBST
once every 20 minutes, they were incubated with primary
antibodies against β-actin (loading control), Ku70,
Ku80, m-calpain, and γ-H2AX in TBST with 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and histone (loading control) in
TBST with 5% skimmed milk at 4 °C overnight. The
following day, the membranes were washed three times
with TBST every 20 minutes, and secondary antibodies of
anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase for histones and
anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase for the remaining

Immunofluorescence assay
MCF10A cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells
per well in an 8-well cell culture slide (SPL, Korea). The
following day, the cells were incubated with ionomycin
in serum-free medium for 2 hours. After being washed
with ice-cold PBS, cells were then fixed with 3.7%
formaldehyde in PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 20
minutes. The fixed cells were washed three times with
PBS and permeated by incubation at room temperature
for 10 minutes with immunofluorescence lysis buffer
containing 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM
MgCl2, 300 mM sucrose, and 0.5% Triton X-100. After
washing with PBS, the cell culture slide was incubated
with blocking solution containing 3% BSA in PBS for
1 hour at room temperature and subsequently with antim-calpain antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4
°C. The following day, the cell culture slide was washed
three times with PBS every 10 minutes and incubated
with an AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody

of the Ku 80 were used, a generous gift from Prof. Y.S.
Lee (Ewha Womans Univ. Korea). To transfect each gene,
239FT cells were seeded in 60-mm cell culture plates
at a density of 5 x 105 cells and incubated for various
times using the WelFect QTM Plus kit (Welgene, Korea).
The most efficient transfection time was elucidated by
monitoring the extent of protein expression by Western
blotting analysis using an anti-flag antibody (Cell
Signaling, USA). Following transfection, cells were
incubated with 0.75 μM of ionomycin for 2 hours. Results
were obtained by Western blotting analysis.

Lentivirus-mediated small hairpin RNA

Immunoprecipitation assay

MCF10A cells were seeded in 6-well plates (SPL,
Korea) and incubated until the confluency was greater
than 90%. Subsequently, 1 mL of culture medium was
removed, and 1 mL of shRNA lentivirus and 8 μg/mL
of polybrene were added. m-Calpain-targeting shRNAs
in four different pLKO.1-shRNA plasmids were kindly
provided by Prof. H.G. Yoon (Yonsei Univ, Korea). After
2 days, cells were moved to a 100-mm cell culture plate
(Nunc, USA), and shRNA-infected cells were selected
with 3 μg/mL puromycin. The surviving cells were
maintained for 2 weeks with 1 μg/mL puromycin, and the
expression level of m-calpain was monitored by Western
blotting analysis.

Immunoprecipitation was performed in 3 steps;
preparation of the lysates, pre-clearing of the lysates, and
precipitation of the immune complexes. Firstly, MCF10A
cells were lysed with RIPA buffer, and lysate samples
were prepared in the same process as for Western blotting
analysis. Secondly, 500 μg of cell lysates were incubated
with 1 μg of normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotech, CA) and
1 μL of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech,
CA) at 4 °C for 30 minutes with gentle shaking and then
centrifuged at 4 °C and 12000 rpm for 10 minutes. The
supernatant was collected, and the anti-Ku70 antibody
was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation.
The following day, the protein A-agarose beads were
added, rocked for 2 hours, and centrifuged at 4 °C and
12000 rpm for 10 minutes. The pellet was collected after
washing twice with RIPA buffer. Immune complexes were
resuspended in 20 μL 2X SDS sample buffer and boiled
at 95 °C for 5 minutes. Samples were separated by SDSPAGE electrophoresis.

In vitro μ- and m-calpain assay
The in vitro μ- and m-calpain assay was performed
by mixing each protein in μ- and m-calpain reaction
buffer, respectively. μ-Calpain reaction buffer was
composed of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol
adjusted to pH 7.5 with HCl, and m-calpain reaction
buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM
β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM EDTA, with pH adjusted
to 7.5 with HCl. Ku70 and Ku80 proteins were purchased
from Abcam (USA). μ-Calpain (human erythrocyte) and
m-calpain (recombinant, High Purity, E. Coli) enzymes
were obtained from Calbiochem (Germany). Then, 0.2
μg of Ku proteins and 0.8 units of each calpain were
mixed in the respective calpain buffer, and calcium was
added. The final concentration of calcium was 2.5 mM
and 5 mM for μ- and m-calpain activation, respectively,
according to previous studies [69, 70]. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 5 mM EDTA and 2X sample
buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10%
β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.6 μM bromophenol blue), and
Western blotting analysis was performed.

Comet assay
The comet assay was performed using the Alkaline
CometAssay® kit (Trevigen, USA). MCF10A cells were
seeded in 6-well cell culture plates at a density of 105 cells
per well and cultured for 2 days. Cells were incubated
with or without 3 μM adriamycin, 0.75 μM ionomycin,
and 50 μM calpeptin for 3 hours in serum-free media.
Prior to harvesting cells, LMAgarose was melted in a
beaker of boiling water and then cooled in a 37 °C water
bath. Trypsinized cells were combined with molten
LMAgarose at a ratio of 1:10, immediately transferred
onto a CometSlide™, and incubated at 4 °C in the dark
for 10 minutes. The slides were subsequently immersed
in lysis solution that had been cooled to 4 °C before use.
After 30 minutes, the slides were incubated in alkaline
unwinding solution (0.2 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA) for 20
minutes at room temperature and electrophoresed at 15 V
for 20 minutes in electrophoresis solution (0.2 M NaOH,
1 mM EDTA, pH>13). The slides were then washed twice
with double distilled water and once with 70% ethanol
for 5 minutes each. Subsequently, the samples were dried

Green for 15 minutes in the dark, mounted on coverslips,
and sealed with clear nail polish. Images were captured
using a Zeiss HBO100 microscope illumination system
(Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an epq100-isolated
epifluorescence condenser. Approximately 100 spots of
MCF10A cells were randomly analyzed with an image
analysis system (Komet 5.5, Kinetic Imaging Ltd, UK).
The Komet 5.5 software calculated the lengths of the
comet tails, and the mean values represent the extent of
the DNA damage.
