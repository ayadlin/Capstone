BACKGROUND: Increased soluble human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (sHER2) is an indicator of a poor prognosis in HER2positive metastatic breast cancer. In this study, the authors evaluated levels of sHER2 during treatment and at the time of disease
recurrence in the adjuvant North Central Cancer Treatment Group N9831 clinical trial. METHODS: The objectives were to describe
sHER2 levels during treatment and at the time of recurrence in patients who were randomized to treatment arms A (standard chemotherapy), B (standard chemotherapy with sequential trastuzumab), and C (standard chemotherapy with concurrent trastuzumab).
Baseline samples were available from 2318 patients, serial samples were available from 105 patients, and recurrence samples were
available from 124 patients. The cutoff sHER2 value for the assay was 15 ng/mL. Statistical methods included repeated measures linear models, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and Cox regression models. RESULTS: There were differences between groups in terms of age,
menopausal status, and hormone receptor status. Within treatment arms A, B, and C, patients who had baseline sHER2 levels 15 ng/
mL had worse disease-free survival than patients who had baseline sHER2 levels <15 ng/mL (arm A: hazard ratio, 1.81; P 5 .0014; arm
B: hazard ratio, 2.08; P 5 .0015; arm C: hazard ratio, 1.96; P 5 .01). Among the 124 patients who experienced disease recurrence,
sHER2 levels increased from baseline to the time of recurrence in arms A and B but remained unchanged in arm C. Patients who had
recurrence sHER2 levels 15 ng/mL had a shorter survival after recurrence with a 3-year overall survival rate of 51% compared
with 77% for those who had recurrence sHER2 levels <15 ng/mL (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-4.70; P 5 .01).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early stage, HER2-positive breast cancer, a high baseline sHER2 level was identified as a prognostic
marker associated with shorter disease-free survival, and a high sHER2 level at recurrence was predictive of shorter survival. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is a significant health problem worldwide, with an estimated 1.38 million women diagnosed annually.1
There remains a significant interest in and a need to identify prognostic and predictive characteristics of the disease to help
understand its natural history and its impact on therapeutic selection.2 The discovery of amplification and/or overexpression of the tyrosine kinase human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in 15% to 20% of invasive breast cancers
and the correlation of HER2 overexpression with a worse prognosis in both locoregional and advanced disease have revolutionized the understanding of the prognosis and therapeutic management of patients with breast cancer.3
Clinical advancements have principally been accomplished with the use of trastuzumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against HER2 that has demonstrated activity against HER2-overexpressing, invasive breast cancers in both
locoregional and advanced disease.4-7 Identifying biologic predictors to optimize prognosis and selecting patients for antiHER2 therapy with or without other therapies are significant foci of our research and that of others.

Original Article

In addition to evaluating HER2 and other molecular
markers in tissue specimens, there has been great interest
in serologic-based testing for circulating HER2 because of
the accessibility of serologic testing and the possibility of
serial monitoring for tumor response to therapy.8 HER2
is a 185-kDa protein composed of an intracellular domain, a transmembrane, and an extracellular domain
(ECD). The ECD is occasionally cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases and is released into the peripheral circulation as soluble HER2 (sHER2),9 where it can be
quantified using commercially available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays.10 Therefore, sHER2 is a logical
marker to evaluate as a prognostic and/or predictive factor
in the setting of metastatic and early stage HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.
Some data gathered over the last few years support
the evaluation of this marker, whereas others do not.11-14
Carney et al conducted a meta-analysis of 55 publications
(>6500 patients) evaluating the prevalence, prognosis,
prediction of response to therapy, and potential use of
sHER2 for monitoring breast cancer.11 In that study,
from 0% to 38% of patients (mean, 18.5%) with HER2positive, early stage breast cancer and from 23% to 80%
of patients (mean, 43%) with metastatic breast cancer had
sHER2 concentrations that were above the control cutoff
described in each publication. Results from the meta-analysis suggested that a high circulating sHER2 level is a
prognostic factor of inferior progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) and a predictive factor of
a poor response to endocrine therapy and some chemotherapy regimens. Those authors also noted that serial
increases in sHER2 may precede the appearance of metastases and that longitudinal sHER2 changes could predict
the clinical course of the underlying disease. Although the
data regarding metastatic breast cancer demonstrate a possible correlation of tumor burden and clinical outcome
with sHER2, there are very little data regarding the significance of sHER2 levels in the adjuvant setting. Our North
Central Cancer Treatment Group adjuvant trial N9831 is
an ideal study in which to explore the role of sHER2 as a
potential prognostic or predictive marker, because it is a
large prospective study of chemotherapy alone or with
trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive resected
breast cancer.15
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The eligibility criteria and study design for N9831 have
been previously reported.4 Patients were required to have
histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast
with 3 1 immunohistochemical staining for HER2 or
2676

amplification of the HER2 gene by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (2.0 ratio) and with either lymph nodepositive or high-risk lymph node-negative disease to be eligible for the study. The N9831 trial had 3 treatments
arms (arm A: doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 3
weeks for 4 cycles followed by weekly paclitaxel for 12
weeks; arm B: sequential trastuzumab treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks for 4
cycles, followed by weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks, followed by 52 weeks of weekly trastuzumab; arm C: concurrent trastuzumab treatment, doxorubicin and
cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by
weekly paclitaxel plus concurrent trastuzumab for 12
weeks, followed by 40 more weeks of weekly
trastuzumab).
In a plan to examine correlations with clinical outcomes, serum samples were scheduled to be obtained at
baseline from all patients (at study entry; all patients were
postprimary surgical resection of tumors); throughout
treatment in a subset of 35 patients per arm (every 3
months for the first year then every 6 months from year 2
to year 5; these samples were part of a planned cardiac
marker substudy); and, when available, at the time of tumor recurrence for all patients who developed recurrent
disease. The median follow-up for these patients was 4.7
years. Specimens were analyzed using the commercially
available Advia Centaur serum HER2 assay (Wilex/Oncogene Science, Cambridge, Mass). Payne et al have demonstrated that trastuzumab does not interfere with this
serum HER2 assay.16
The cutoff for this assay for normal and high sHER2
levels was 15 ng/mL according to the US Food and Drug
Administration-approved ADVIA Centaur HER-2/neu
assay recommendation. Of the total 3505 patients enrolled in the trial, baseline samples were available for 2318
patients participating in treatment arms A (n 5 795), B
(n 5 814), and C (n 5 709). For various reasons, 1187
patients were excluded from the statistical analysis, as outlined in Figure 1. Serial samples were available from 105
patients, and recurrence samples were available from 124
patients for analyses. Statistical methods included Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Cox regression models. A linear
mixed effects model was used in the analysis of serial
sHER2 levels. DFS and OS analyses were stratified by
estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status and by lymph node status. Multivariate analyses stratified by ER/PR and lymph node status were conducted
including additional patient characteristics that were significant or borderline significant predictors of baseline
sHER2 levels 15 ng/mL. These included menopausal

status, age, tumor size, tumor grade, and race. Age was not
included simultaneously with menopausal status in models because of their high correlation.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics between patients with sHER2
levels <15 ng/mL (n 5 2029) and patients with sHER2
levels 15 ng/mL (n 5 289) are listed in Table 1. Differences between groups existed by age, menopausal status
(higher sHER2 levels in patients aged 50 years and in
postmenopausal patients), and hormone receptor status
(lower sHER2 levels in hormone receptor-positive
tumors). Table 1 compares the characteristics of patients
with and without baseline blood samples to assess sHER2
levels. Caucasians and patients with tumors <2 cm were
more likely to have a blood sample available.

Within treatment arms A, B and C, patients who
had baseline sHER2 levels 15 ng/mL had worse DFS
than patients who had baseline sHER2 levels <15 ng/mL
(arm A: hazard ratio [HR], 1.81; P 5 .0014; arm B: HR,
2.08; P 5 .0015; arm C: HR, 1.96; P 5 .01) (Table 2).
Table 3 displays a DFS multivariate analysis across all 3
treatment arms. sHER2 levels 15 ng/mL remained
unchanged (HR, 1.95 in both analyses). Similarly, multivariate analyses were performed within each treatment
arm and had minimal effect on sHER2 HRs. With regard
to hormone receptor status, the association of sHER2
with DFS was present within the ER/PR-positive and ER/
PR-negative subgroups (Table 3).
Analyzing serial sHER2 levels during treatment, the
mean loge sHER2 level remained constant over time in
arm C (estimated slope, 0.003; P 5 .43), whereas the

estimated increase per month was 0.010 (loge scale) for arm
B (P 5 .07) and 0.022 (loge scale) for arm A (P  .0001).
On the basis of the linear mixed model at 18 months, the
mean loge sHER2 was 2.98 (95% confidence interval [CI],
2.88-3.08) for arm A, 2.72 (95% CI, 2.62-2.82) for arm B,
and 2.55 (95% CI, 2.42-2.68) for arm C.
Among the 124 patients who developed disease recurrence and had serum samples available for this test,
sHER2 levels increased from baseline to the time of recurrence in arm A (mean, 73.4 ng/mL; median, 1.8 ng/mL;
P 5 .005) (Fig. 2, top) and in arm B (mean, 48.2 ng/mL;
median, 2.2 ng/mL; P 5 .01) (Fig. 2, middle), but
sHER2 levels remained unchanged in arm C (mean, 9.1
ng/mL; median, 2 0.3 ng/mL; P 5 .66) (Fig. 2, bottom).

Patients who had recurrence sHER2 levels 15 ng/mL had
a shorter survival after recurrence, with a 3-year OS rate of
51% compared with 77% for the <15 ng/mL sHER2
group (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.19-4.70; P 5 .01).
DISCUSSION
Some small studies and subsequent meta-analyses that
were published before the widespread use of HER2directed therapies demonstrated a correlation between elevated baseline sHER2 levels and shorter survival in
patients with metastatic breast cancer.11,17 Although the
clinical importance of sHER2 has been studied extensively
in metastatic breast cancer, to date, no consensus has been
reached, and there are little available data regarding the

use of sHER2 in locoregional breast cancer or in the era of
multiple anti-HER2 therapies. A prospective study of 256
consecutive patients with stage I through III breast cancer
demonstrated that sHER2 levels were high in 9% of
patients, and the concordance of high sHER2 levels with
positive HER2 status in tumor tissue was 87.1%.18 High
sHER2 levels were strongly associated with higher disease
stage, higher histologic grade, and negative ER/PR status.
Multivariate analysis identified high sHER2 levels as an
independent prognostic factor of wore DFS. Recently,
data have been published regarding the potential role of
sHER2 in the neoadjuvant setting. In the GeparQuattro
study, investigators assessed whether evaluation of a serum
marker like sHER2 could help monitor and optimize
treatment in 175 patients with early stage breast cancer
who participated in that large neoadjuvant clinical trial.19
Cancer

August 1, 2013

The sHER2 level was measured before treatment initiation and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (presurgery) in
HER2-positive (n 5 90) and HER2 negative (n 5 85)
patient cohorts. That study demonstrated a significant,
positive association between high baseline sHER2 values
and achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) at
the time of surgery in patients with HER2-positive
tumors. A similar correlation also was observed with a
decrease in sHER2 levels during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, as expected, no such association between
sHER2 levels and pCR was observed in the subset of
patients who had HER2 negative disease. In a follow-up
neoadjuvant study, GeparQuinto, the same investigators
noted that higher prechemotherapy sHER2 levels (>15
ng/mL) also were associated with higher pCR rates.20
However, sHER2 levels changed differently during neoadjuvant therapy, with higher declines noted in patients
who received trastuzumab than in those who received
lapatinib. If a pCR is the best surrogate of improved longterm outcome, then a higher baseline sHER2 level would
seem to indicate lower recurrence rates down the road for
these patients who received with neoadjuvant therapy.
This may initially seem contradictory to our finding, but
the situation of these patients is different. A high baseline
sHER2 level in the GeparQuattro and GeparQuinto studies may only reflect higher tumor burden, and its decline
with neoadjuvant therapy and subsequent achievement of
a pCR may reflect a population of patients with treatment-sensitive disease. However, ours was a study

population of patients whose primary tumors had been
resected several weeks earlier; thus, a higher baseline
sHER2 level may represent a population of patients with
2680

residual circulating malignant cells that inherently have a
higher residual risk of systemic relapse.
Data from the adjuvant, early stage, HER2-positive
breast cancer N9831 translational clinical trial present a
unique opportunity for the examination of meaningful
associations and trends between clinical outcome and biomarkers of disease. In the N9831 study, 12% of the 2318
women who enrolled in the study after undergoing breast
cancer resection and who had serum available and
approved for use by written consent, had baseline elevation of sHER2 (289 of 2318 patients). This is consistent
with the percentages reported previously in the meta-analysis of greater than 6500 patients reported by Carney et
al11 and in the study by Ludovini et al.18
In the N9831 trial, higher sHER2 levels were noted
in patients aged 50 years, in postmenopausal patients,
and in those with negative hormone receptor status.
Whether there is a biologic reason for this correlation is
unclear. Patients with high baseline sHER2 levels demonstrated significantly worse DFS in arm A (standard chemotherapy without trastuzumab) compared with patients
who had normal levels, confirming the prognostic relevance of this marker in patients with HER2-positive
breast cancer who do not receive trastuzumab. There also
was a correlation of elevated baseline sHER2 with worse
DFS in patients on arm C (standard chemotherapy plus
concurrent trastuzumab) who had elevated baseline
sHER2 levels (HR, 1.96; P 5 .01). Again, this is in keeping with some of the data published in the metastatic setting, suggesting that patients with elevated sHER2 levels
at baseline have inferior outcomes, in this case, even when
they received treatment with trastuzumab.11,17
It is important to note the differences in trends in
sHER2 levels between arm A (without trastuzumab) and
arm C (with trastuzumab). sHER2 levels progressively
increased in patients who developed tumor recurrence but
did not receive HER2-directed therapy, whereas levels
remained fairly stable in patients who received concurrent
chemotherapy and trastuzumab. This trend persisted in
patients who developed disease recurrence in both treatment arms. Although this observation is intriguing, the
reasons for these data are unclear, and we hope that this
issue will be readdressed in other data sets (and/or by
other investigators). In the meantime, we can speculate
that there may be biologic reasons for these observations,
such as the possibility that trastuzumab therapy may
directly inhibit the detection of sHER2. Molina et al demonstrated that trastuzumab prevents sHER2 shedding by
inhibition of basal and activated HER2 proteolytic cleavage well before it induces any detectable decrease in cell

surface HER2.21 It is also possible that relapse in patients
who did not receive trastuzumab therapy is primarily
mediated by the classic HER2 pathway, although patients
on the trastuzumab-containing arm who experienced progression developed it independent of the HER2 oncoprotein or through alternative pathways that confer acquired
resistance to trastuzumab.
On the basis of the results presented herein, we can
conclude that, in patients with early stage, resected,
HER2-positive breast cancer, sHER is a prognostic
marker associated with shorter DFS and that a high recurrence sHER2 level is predictive of shorter survival. This
test may help enhance the prognostic information and,
thus, assist in patient education and further studies (such
as including patients with high sHER2 levels in studies to
further evaluate novel therapeutic strategies that enhance
the activity of chemotherapy with trastuzumab).
One of the main autocritiques of this study is that
we started the correlative section with baseline samples
from 2318 patients, but we were able to obtain completed
serial samples from only 105 patients and recurrence samples from only 124 patients. Unfortunately, this is a recurring theme with large prospective trials, although our
study has the largest matched sets between baseline and
recurrent specimens in the adjuvant setting. Patients and
participating institutions are initially eager to participate
in these collections of samples for correlative sciences;
however, as time goes on or as patients are confronted
with updated consents to sign, the number of collections
drops significantly. The small sample size at the time of recurrence makes it difficult to draw absolute conclusions
about why sHER2 levels did not increase among patients
in arm C (which is the current standard of care) compared
with arm A.
Our study has been successful as a tool to explore the
prognostic and predictive value of sHER in patients with
early stage, HER2-positive breast cancer in 1 of the several
early pivotal trials of adjuvant trastuzumab, but it in no
way tries to be a comprehensive review of this test and of
its role in the management of such patients. Several other
biomarkers that have demonstrated promise in preclinical
models are being evaluated in many of the already completed, large adjuvant HER2 clinical trials for their potential to prognosticate risk of disease recurrence and predict
response to anti-HER2-based therapies. To date, none of
those trials have reliably had clinical significance, including p95 HER2,22,23 PTEN,24 PI3-kinase,25,26 topoisomerase IIa,27-30 C-MYC,31 and IGF-1R.32,33 Additional
prospective studies are needed to further evaluate the role
of sHER2 testing in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and

using newer HER2-directed therapies, such as lapatinib,
pertuzumab, and trastuzumab-emtansine.
