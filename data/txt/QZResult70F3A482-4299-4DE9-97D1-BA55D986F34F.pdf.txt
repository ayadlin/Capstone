Chemosensitivity into Tools for Clinical Outcome
Prediction and Drug Discovery in Cancer

Abstract
Substantial effort has been devoted to in vitro testing of candidate chemotherapeutic agents. In particular,
the United States National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI-DTP) Human Tumor
Cell Line Screen has screened hundreds of thousands of compounds and extracts, for which data on more than
40,000 compounds tested on a panel of 60 cancer cell lines (NCI-60) are publically available. In tandem, gene
expression profiling has brought about a sea change in our understanding of cancer biology, allowing discovery of biomarkers or signatures able to characterize, classify, and prognosticate clinical behavior of human
tumors. Recent studies have used tumor profiling matched to clinical trial outcome data to derive gene
expression models predicting therapeutic outcomes, though such efforts are costly, time-consuming, tumor
type-specific, and not amenable to rare diseases. Furthermore, addition of new or established drugs to multidrug combinations in which such models are already available requires the entire model to be re-derived.
Can the aforementioned in vitro testing platform, coupled to the universal language of genomics, be used
to develop, a priori, gene expression models predictive of clinical outcomes? Recent advances, including the
CO-eXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) algorithm, suggest that development of these models may be possible
and raise important implications for future trial design and drug discovery. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1753–8. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Few technological innovations have transformed biology
to the extent high throughput molecular profiling has done.
Such efforts, coupled with a wide variety of platforms for statistical and biological interpretation as well as interinstitutional sharing of the data produced by these assays, have
changed how we study neoplasia. Recent advances suggest
that these technologies may change the way pathologists
and oncologists approach the diagnosis and nosology of tumors, and key recent reports suggest that the use of prediction frameworks developed from gene expression profiling
data, roughly, gene expression models (GEM), can be developed and clinically implemented to provide accurate prognostication of disease course (1) and even therapeutic
benefit (2). For example, in bladder cancer, studies have developed GEMs predicting chemotherapeutic response of
muscle invasive tumors (3, 4).
Although these efforts lay the foundation for implementation of molecular tools to predict patient benefit from stanAuthors' Affiliations: 1Department of Molecular Physiology, University of

dard cancer chemotherapeutic regimens, they come with
important limitations. Such GEMs must be developed a
posteriori, on the basis of profiling patient tumors at baseline
followed by supervised biomarker discovery comparing clinical
responders and nonresponders, with subsequent validation in
independent trials. Thus, such strategies are not adaptable to
rare orphan tumors (insufficient numbers for trials) or cancers
of unknown primary (among the 10 most common cancer diagnoses; ref. 5). Such strategies also do not suggest a “salvage”
therapeutic option for predicted nonresponders, and such
approaches are not adaptable for a priori stratification of patients for novel agents in which clinical trial outcome is not
known. Finally, upon addition of approved or investigational
agents to standard combination regimens, existing GEMs
must perforce be rebuilt and prospectively revalidated.
The United States National Cancer Institute's Developmental Therapeutics Program's (NCI-DTP) NCI-60 Human
Tumor Cell Line Screen, which has tested 60 cancer cell lines
derived from 9 common histologies tested with more than
110,000 compounds of which more than 45,000 are publicly
available, provides a rich database of in vitro drug response
data (6). Initially intended as a government-sponsored drug
discovery pipeline, this initiative has already made significant
contributions directly to this objective. In addition, these data
are a rich source of information that could be mined for additional biological insights. For example, reports as early as 2001
showed that using gene expression profiling of these 60 cell
lines, coupled to the vast in vitro response data in the NCI60 screen, investigators could develop signatures predictive

of sensitivity within the same cell line panel (7). Taken a step
further, what if the language of gene expression could be used
to systematically extrapolate drug sensitivity results observed
in cell culture screening to predict tumor behavior in patients? Surprisingly, only lately has this been shown by us
(8, 9) and by others (10).

Motivation for the Development of the COXEN
Algorithm
Bladder cancer–derived cell lines were not included in
the NCI-60 cell line panel. Our desire to develop chemotherapeutic response prediction models for this tumor type
prompted us to develop a collection of nearly 40 commonly
used bladder cancer cell lines, which we called BLA-40.
These were profiled for their baseline gene expression using
oligonucleotide microarrays, and tested in vitro for sensitivity to several chemotherapeutic drugs relevant in the treatment of urothelial cancer, including gemcitabine, cisplatin,
and paclitaxel. Using a classification algorithm that favors
discovery of robust, parsimonious gene expression models
and is relatively resistant to “overfitting” (11), we were able
to show in cross-validation studies correct prediction of
drug sensitivity across the three drugs. Most compellingly,
given the frequent use of doublet (gemcitabine-cisplatin)
therapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer (12), we were
able to predict response to doublet combination chemotherapy within the cell lines with 80% accuracy (P =
0.0002; ref. 13). We recently reported a similar effort for
the dual EGFR-HER2 inhibitor, lapatinib (14).
With this expression-profiled bladder cancer cell panel in
hand but lacking the resources to carry out large-scale drug
screening, we formulated the hypothesis that perhaps clustering of the NCI-60 gene expression data with that of
BLA-40 would allow us to project the in vitro drug sensitivity
data available on the NCI-60 to the bladder cancer cells lines.
Unfortunately, this simplistic approach was not successful as
the cell lines clustered primarily by histological subtype. To
correct for this, we first identified the genes whose expression in the NCI-60 was related to drug sensitivity and then
determined which of these genes maintained concordant expression in the BLA-40 panel. This is done through comparisons of correlation matrices. For example, for a list of 50
candidate sensitivity genes, a 50 × 50 matrix of the correlation of expression of the 50 genes, across the first cell line
data set, to each of the other 50 genes is generated. The same
matrix is then prepared from the second cell line data set
gene expression data. Finally, each row (i.e., each genecandidate biomarker) of these two correlation matrices is
then correlated between the two matrices to generate a second correlation coefficient (the COXEN coefficient), reflective
of whether that particular candidate biomarker maintains
concordant relationships to the other candidate genes. A
correlation coefficient cutoff may thus be used to select the
concordant subset, which are then used for GEM development. Thus, this “correlation of correlations” step allows
selection, through requiring intercohort concordant expres-

sion, of genes relevant to both cell line panels while maintaining strict independence of the data sets with respects
to the drug sensitivity outcomes in the second cohort. We
call this process COeXpression ExtrapolatioN, or COXEN,
and have employed it for several combinations of cell line
panel to cell line panel and cell line panel to human tumor
projections as described below. COXEN was also used for
computational drug discovery in bladder cancer using in vitro
sensitivity data obtained from the NCI-60 panel. These applications are summarized in Fig. 1.

Applications of COXEN in Therapeutic
Response Prediction
Our first report of the development and use of this methodology described several applications of COXEN (8). The
first was to use gene expression data for the NCI-60 cell lines,
coupled with their published in vitro sensitivity data to the
drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel, to predict sensitivity of our
BLA-40 cell lines. By using a COXEN step to select concordant genes from NCI-60 data-derived candidate sensitivity
biomarkers and implement them into GEMs, we were able
to predict sensitive and resistant bladder cancer cell lines
with accuracies of 85% for cisplatin and 78% for paclitaxel
on the basis of the NCI-60 cell line data alone.
The next application used gene expression and in vitro
sensitivity data for paclitaxel and tamoxifen to predict actual
therapeutic outcomes in two clinical studies in which breast
cancer patients had their tumors expression profiled. In the
first case COXEN used paclitaxel in vitro cell line data to generate GEMs, which were applied to the clinical trial response
data for the related taxane, docetaxel. Three such models exhibited a classification accuracy of 75% for the 11 responders
and 13 nonresponders in this trial. A second clinical study–
based implementation used a similar approach to predict
metastatic recurrence of 60 estrogen receptor positive breast
cancer patients treated with tamoxifen whose tumor tissues
were gene expression profiled before therapy. Based on
GEMs derived from concordant subsets of NCI-60 sensitivity
data and untreated human breast tumors derived biomarkers, we were able to predict with 71% accuracy recurrence
in this patient cohort (8).
Recently, we have undertaken an extensive validation of
the COXEN methodology using data from an additional seven independent clinical trials of nearly 500 patients of diverse
geographic and ethnic backgrounds (9). Importantly, 233 of
these patients were from trials with prospective enrollment.
We developed drug-specific GEMs, again, by comparing gene
expression in cell lines from the NCI-60 screen on the basis of
in vitro sensitivity and used separate breast, bladder, and ovarian cancer gene expression data sets (without response data
and unrelated to those trials examined in the study) for the
COXEN step. Then, concordant sensitivity biomarkers were
used to develop COXEN GEMs, which were evaluated singly
and in combination for ability to predict response and survival outcomes for several published studies including bladder cancer patients (N = 59) treated with methotrexate,

The COXEN Principle

Figure 1. The COXEN algorithm and its implementations. Reported uses of the COXEN algorithm have included both intercohort prediction of sensitivity
between different cell line panels for drug discovery and cell line to tumor prediction for response stratification in clinical trials. Either way, the workflow
proceeds per the sequence illustrated at left. The algorithm starts by deriving candidate biomarkers by comparing gene expression data between
sensitive and resistant cell lines from the NCI-60, a step which can be regarded as biomarker discovery. Next candidate biomarkers are triaged by COXEN
to ensure concordant expression between data sets. Then concordant biomarkers are used to derive GEMs, predictive of sensitivity to individual drugs or
combinations. Finally, such models are used to classify cell lines or tumors on the basis of their own gene expression data, and prediction scores are
examined with respects to empirical (in vitro) or observed (clinical trial) response outcomes. In the case of drug discovery, GEMs can be derived for each of
thousands of drugs tested against the NCI-60 panel, then drugs ranked by percentage predicted responders to prioritize them for preclinical evaluation.

vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC), breast cancer patients (N = 275) treated with 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin,
and cyclophosphamide, and ovarian cancer patients (N = 143)
treated with combination platinum-based therapies.
Importantly, for two studies of bladder cancer tested, these
COXEN GEMs did well for patients in both the neoadjuvant
(N = 45; refs. 3, 15) and advanced tumor (N = 14; ref. 4) settings. When single drug GEMs for each of MVAC were combined, prediction scores found to be significantly different
between responders and nonresponders (P = 0.002 and
0.03, respectively), resulting in a sensitivity of 83%, specificity
64%, positive predictive value of 71%, and negative predictive
value of 78%. Compellingly, in the neoadjuvant data set (3, 15),
which was large enough for multivariate analysis, the COXEN
GEM scores were found to be independent of a variety of
traditional clinicopathologic parameters and the only parameter independently associated with response.
For breast and ovarian cancer, the COXEN GEMs developed from NCI-60 cell line testing was done similarly. Whereas single drug GEMs for doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and

www.aacrjournals.org

5-fluorouracil did well in two separate gene expression–
profiled breast cancer drug outcome studies (N = 133 and
N = 45, respectively), combination GEMs for these three
drugs—used in both studies—were significantly associated
with patient responses and survival status (as were the outcomes studied, respectively). This finding was associated
with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 53%. In a third
gene expression–matched neoadjuvant study of gemcitabine,
epirubicin, and docetaxel for breast cancer patients (N = 100),
each single-drug COXEN GEM, as well as a three-drug combination GEM, provided prediction scores significantly different between responders and nonresponders. In the first trial,
the only case in which complete clinical data were available
for multivariate analyses, both estrogen receptor status and
the combination GEM were found to be significantly independently prognostic for response. Similarly, in two studies
of ovarian cancer (adjuvant N = 119, neoadjuvant N = 24),
COXEN GEMs for carboplatin and paclitaxel were both
significantly predictive of response and survival, as well
as independently predictive of response to therapy in the

larger adjuvant trial in which complete clinicopathologic data
were available for multivariate analysis.
One interesting aspect of these findings that pertains to the
interplatform and interhistology ability of COXEN was illustrated by a recent analysis we subsequently did on the breast
and ovarian cancer studies from the above report. Wishing to
determine whether cell line training set composition (as regards cell line tissue of origin) impacted the accuracy of prediction, we excluded breast cancer (N = 5) and ovarian cancer
(N = 7) cell lines from the NCI-60 panel and re-derived GEMs.
We found that the GEM predictions derived without breast or
ovarian cancer cell lines included in training were essentially
unchanged.5 In the same vein, in the Williams and colleagues
report, we specifically examined whether the stage composition of the data set used for the COXEN step (specifically,
whether the tumors did or did not exhibit muscle invasion)
changed the results. We found that either way it resulted in
essentially identical outcome predictions (9).

Applications of COXEN in Computational Drug
Screening
We also reported an application of COXEN for in silico
drug discovery. The publically available NCI-60 screening data for >43,000 candidate compounds, together with NCI-60
gene expression profiling, was used to develop drugspecific candidate biomarkers, concordant between the
NCI-60 and BLA-40, which were implemented as GEMs predictive of sensitivity in the bladder cell lines in vitro. In fact,
139 compounds were identified for which >35% of the BLA-40
were predicted to be sensitive, of which 8 had >50% predicted
sensitive. The top hit for this screen was the cytotoxic imidazoacridinone, NSC-637993, which we showed empirically to
exhibit submicromolar GI50s in >60% of the BLA-40 cells. In
comparison, the anchor drug of bladder cancer combination
chemotherapy, cisplatin, exhibits submicromolar GI50s in only 22% of cells (8). Perhaps more importantly, we also found
that a structurally similar compound, C1311, was also a top
COXEN hit. This finding is relevant because: (1) COXEN computational screening was able to find closely related analogs;
(2) C1311 has significant cytotoxic activity in vitro and in vivo
for a range of cancer cell lines (16); (3) C1311 has been tested
in phase 1 (17 18 19) and phase 2 (20) trials for breast and
other advanced solid tumors, potentially facilitating rapid
translation of C1311 to bladder cancer patients.
In prior studies the cytotoxic activity of C1311 has been
evaluated in 16 human cell lines from solid tumor types and
leukemias producing a median IC50 of 0.3 μM (16). In vivo,
C1311 caused 77% growth inhibition of HT29 colon cancer
xenografts compared with 17% for paclitaxel (21). Importantly, no cross-resistance was seen between in vitro sensitivity to C1311 and doxorubicin or paclitaxel, two agents used in
human bladder cancer, opening the possibility of effective
combinations of C1311 with these agents. Consistent with

these findings, we recently completed testing of C1311 in vitro
in our BLA-40 panel and observed a median GI50 of 0.5 μM.6

Questions and Future Directions
The ability of the COXEN methodology to produce, solely on
the basis of gene expression profiling coupled to in vitro NCI-60
testing, predictive models capable of stratifying patients is suggestive of several important applications that address limitations of gene expression models derived from a posteriori
analysis of gene expression against patient treatment outcomes.
Principally, these studies show that a priori stratification of patients is possible, offering the opportunity to substantially reduce the size of clinical trials for novel agents (22), while
potentially avoiding treating patients who are unlikely to receive any clinical benefit from investigational or even standard
of care regimens. For example, in the case of bladder cancer,
cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is associated with
substantial morbidity and up to 3% mortality (12). The ability
to stratify patients on the basis of probability of response to
standard therapies could spare the substantial proportion of
therapeutic nonresponders (∼50% in larger studies; ref. 12)
the toxicity associated with therapy while preventing delay
of surgery in the neoadjuvant setting (23). As authors have observed before, for advanced and inoperable patients, earlier triage of predicted nonresponders to investigational agents
could take place before further deterioration of performance
status, a key factor for survival time in advanced disease (4).
In the case of investigational agents, particularly targeted
agents, increasing experience in this area has suggested that
a priori stratification of patients is essential to design trials
enriched with responders and to exclude participants unlikely
to enjoy any clinical benefit (22). Recent a posteriori studies
have found that in some cases, particular genetic lesions confer exquisite sensitivity or resistance to targeted agents (24,
25), whereas we note that, in the case of EGFR mutations
and drug response in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), between ∼5 to 15% of mutation-negative patients still enjoy a
therapeutic response (24). We suggest that constructing GEMs
a priori on the basis of in vitro response by using COXEN might
offer the opportunity to represent a core responder phenotype
with gene expression that can be further refined when combined with targeted evaluations such as mutations or activity
of signaling intermediates. Supporting this idea is a recent report by Balko and colleagues, who reported signatures of gefitinib sensitivity from in vitro studies that were predictive of
EGFR mutation and activation status in NSCLC tissues (26).
In addition, there is no reason that predictive nomograms
could not be built on the basis of traditional clinicopathologic
characteristics, mutation or activation markers, and yet
include a GEM; indeed, we have incorporated phosphoprotein
biomarkers into the development of combination GEMs for
prediction of BLA-40 sensitivity to lapatinib (27).

The COXEN Principle

This technology raises the specter of other possible implementations. For example, future studies in vitro and in animal models might show that COXEN GEMs can predict
efficacious agents for nonresponders to standard of care
agents. Could such a strategy be implemented to suggest
an approved agent or combination for rare orphan tumor
histologies, in which standard of care consists of only empiric
multi-agent therapies because large randomized trials are
not feasible? Most provocatively, could this type of technology be employed to offer other approved anticancer agents to
predicted standard of care nonresponders? Similar issues
have been raised by other investigators in the field, who have
questioned whether prospective validation might always be
necessary, particularly in critical cases such as second or
third line therapy for treatment failures in which no standard
of care exists (28). Although the practical and ethical concerns of these kinds of implementations are manifest and deserve serious consideration and debate, it is clear that novel
trial formats will be necessary to evaluate such interventions
that are eo ipso outside of current designs. One potential way
to address these concerns may be to use methodologies like
COXEN GEMs to select therapies to add to standard of care
regimens, as is often the trial design used to show efficacy for
promising agents. Clearly, though, complex pharmacologic
interactions will need to be considered in any combination
that is computationally recommended.
From the standpoint of development, two significant
opportunities are offered by COXEN. This technology can
be used early on to evaluate which tumor histologies are
most likely to respond to newly developed agents, suggesting ways to enrich early clinical trials with such patients
increasing the chances for success. This approach could
also be used in the unfortunate case of failed clinical trials
for a drug salvage and/or repositioning strategy in another
tumor system, with the theoretical ability to find success
in a different tumor histology after trial failures in its primary target. Such trials would be especially efficient and
more rapid because the pharmacology and toxicity of the
drug would have been already well documented in prior
studies.
Finally, whereas we have used COXEN to link cell line panels to other panels or to human tumors by virtue of the
common language of gene expression, the principle is not
limited by the platform. As such, we are in the process of
evaluating the ability of COXEN to generate predictive biomarkers using DNA, microRNA, as well as proteomic data
sets from tumors and body fluids.

Caveats and Limitations
Several limitations must be taken into consideration and
interpretation of the COXEN findings. First, except for 233
of the breast cancer patients in the most recent report, the
patient cohorts in which we have studied the predictive ability of the COXEN GEMs were not prospectively enrolled,
which can introduce selection biases. Though this limits
the generality of interpretation of the potential role of GEMs
in such a setting, it is reassuring to have observed significant

www.aacrjournals.org

prediction, retrospectively, in smaller patient subsets across
multiple tumor types reported from geographically different
areas. It is revealing, however, that recently this issue has
come to the attention of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, who have suggested in their nonbinding recommendations, Draft Guidance: In vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index
Assays (29), that “use of archived samples and/or retrospective
data may sometimes be used to support clearance or approval, provided the study design and sample composition reflect
the intended use of the device in the intended population.”
Beyond the larger concerns of how and under what
circumstances COXEN or other powerful predictive technologies may be used or approved for use in patients
(28), COXEN raises important technical implementation
questions. For example, it certainly is not customary in
the general practice of oncology for most cancer types to
subject patients to the additional morbidity of biopsy of, let
alone metastectomy, for presumed metastatic disease. If
COXEN GEMs are capable of predicting sensitivity in such
a setting, is the original, primary tumor from the definitive
resection even the correct lesion to profile for prediction?
If not, what degree of efficacy, however defined, of predictive GEMs must be shown to outweigh the risk of invasive
surgical or imaging-guided sampling procedures (as has
been reported recently; ref. 30) to secure tissues of the metastasis itself to use for prediction. This kind of question becomes all the more important in the setting of metastatic
recurrence postadjuvant chemotherapy, as occurs with some
frequency in bladder cancer, as such lesions are often chemoresistant and trials of second-line agents generally observe low response rates. Perhaps circulating tumor cells
could be evaluated for the COXEN-derived GEMs (31), and
this may be a solution that obviates the need for biopsy in
patients in which such tumors can be captured and analyzed.

Conclusion
In summary, the COXEN algorithm shows promise as a
means to use genomic information as a universal language
to translate drug sensitivity biomarkers between cell line and
tumor platforms. The findings reviewed herein constitute the
first attempt at laying a foundation for future implementations
that seem compelling and suggestive. Future studies ranging
from model systems and preclinical studies to prospective
clinical trials will determine if this concept, now in its infancy,
will grow up into a strong adult in the fight against cancer.
