Abstract
(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a well-known chemoprevention factor. Recent studies have revealed that EGCG
triggers cancer cells undergoing apoptosis through p53dependent pathway. How EGCG activates p53-dependent
apoptosis is not fully understood. In the present study using
JB6 cell as a model system, we have shown that EGCG can
negatively regulate protein serine/threonine phosphatase-2A
(PP-2A) to positively regulate p53-dependent apoptosis. First,
EGCG at physiologic levels down-regulates PP-2A at the
protein and enzyme activity levels. Second, EGCG induces
apoptosis of JB6 cells, which is associated with hyperphosphorylation of p53 and up-regulation of the proapoptotic
gene, Bak. DNA sequence analysis, gel mobility shifting,
chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter gene activity
assays revealed that p53 directly controls Bak in JB6 cells.
Knockdown of p53 and Bak expression with RNAi substantially inhibits EGCG-induced apoptosis. Third, PP-2A directly
interacts with p53 and dephosphorylates p53 at Ser-15 in vitro
and in vivo. Fourth, overexpression of the catalytic subunit for
PP-2A down-regulates p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, attenuates expression of the downstream proapoptotic gene, Bak,
and antagonizes EGCG-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of
PP-2A activity enhances p53 phosphorylation at Ser-15 and
up-regulates Bak expression to promote EGCG-induced
apoptosis. Finally, in the p53 / H1299 and p53+/+ H1080
cells, EGCG down-regulates PP-2A similarly but induces
differential apoptosis. In summary, our results show that (a)
PP-2A directly dephosphorylates p53 at Ser-15; (b) P53
directly controls Bak expression; and (c) EGCG negatively
regulates PP-2A. Together, our results show that EGCGmediated negative regulation of PP-2A is an important
molecular event for the activation of p53-dependent apoptosis
during its chemoprevention. [Cancer Res 2008;68(11):4150–62]

(1–3). Regarding its action mechanisms, previous studies have
shown that EGCG exerts its antitumorigenesis through regulation
of various protein kinases, which consist of mitogen-activated
protein kinase family members [extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)1/2, and p38; refs. 4–7],
InB kinase (8, 9), Akt kinases (7, 10), PKC (11), receptor-linked
kinase (12), and others (1–3). Through these different kinases,
EGCG regulates several major signaling pathways including
activator protein (AP), nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/AKT (1–3).
Compared with our understanding of EGCG action on protein
kinases, its regulation on protein serine/threonine phosphatases
remains largely unknown. In the present study, we have examined
the EGCG action on the protein serine/threonine phosphatase-2A
(PP-2A). In eukaryotes, dephosphorylation at the serine/threonine
sites is largely executed by four major protein phosphatases:
phosphatase-1 (PP-1), PP-2A, phosphatase-2B (PP-2B), and phosphatase-2C (13). In mammals, PP-1 and PP-2A account for >90% of
total protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity (14), and PP-2A
is the most abundant serine/threonine-specific phosphatase,
representing f0.3% of the total cellular protein (15). PP-2A is a
major player in many biological processes including proliferation,
differentiation, development and morphogenesis, as well as organ
function (15–21).
PP-2A exists in cells in two major forms: holoenzyme and core
enzyme (16, 22). The core enzyme of PP-2A comprises a 65-kDa
scaffolding A subunit and a 36-kDa catalytic C subunit (22). PP-2A
activity is largely regulated by the binding of one of at least 18
regulatory B subunits to the A to C core enzyme (16, 22). Previous
studies have revealed that both the scaffold A subunit and the
regulatory B subunit are involved in regulation of carcinogenesis
(19, 23). The evidence for the involvement of scaffold A subunits
in tumorigenesis is derived from the discovery that both Aa and
Ah subunits are found mutated or deleted in 15% lung, breast,
colon, and skin cancers (24, 25). The mutation or deletion of
either of these subunits likely abolishes its ability to bind the
regulatory B unit, or both B and C subunits (26, 27). On the other
hand, the implication of the regulatory B subunits in tumorigenesis is reasoned from the observations that Ras-mediated cell
transformation does not occur in the absence of either Ras or
small T antigen in both human fibroblasts or embryonic kidney
cells (28, 29). It was observed that the function of the small
T antigen is to displace the regulatory B subunit(s) and, thus, to
suppress PP-2A activity (30, 31). However, whether the catalytic
subunit alone can directly regulate carcinogenesis remains to be
further explored. In the present study, we present first evidence to
shown that the catalytic subunit of PP-2A (PP-2Acs) alone plays
an important in modulating carcinogenesis through dephosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and inhibition of p53-Bak pathway.

EGCG Negatively Regulates PP-2A to Promote Apoptosis

Figure 1. Regulation of PP-2Acs by
EGCG at the mRNA, protein enzyme
activity, and cellular localization levels. Aa
and Ba, EGCG down-regulates expression
of the mRNA and protein for the catalytic
subunit of PP-2A. Mouse JB6 Cl41 cells
were treated with 0, 10, 20, and 80 Amol/L
EGCG in the absence (A) or presence (B)
of 20 ng/mL TPA for 24 h with 0.1% serum
in culture medium, then harvested for
extraction of total RNA and proteins.
RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were
conducted as described in the materials
and methods. Bb and Bb, EGCG
down-regulates the enzyme activity of
PP-2A. JB6 C141 cells were treated as in
Aa or Ba and then harvested for extraction
of total proteins. PP-2A activity was
assayed as previously described (33, 34).
Note that the protein and enzyme activity
were clearly down-regulated at 10 to
20 Amol/L of EGCG (A and B). Ca to Cd,
immunocytochemistry analysis of PP-2Acs
localization in JB6 C141 cells. Mouse JB6
Cl41 cells were treated with 0 Amol/L (Ca ),
10 Amol/L (Cb ), 20 Amol/L (Cc), and
80 Amol/L (Cd ) EGCG for 24 h with 0.1%
serum in culture medium, then proceeded
for immunocytochemistry as described in
the Materials and Methods. Note that
EGCG at the 10 to 20 Amol/L promotes
translocation of PP-2Acs from cytoplasm to
nucleus (Cb and Cc). However, under
treatment of 80 Amol/L EGCG, PP-2Acs
were relocated to cytoplasm around
nucleus (Cd ). D, fractionation-linked
Western blot analysis of the PP-2Acs in the
cytoplasm (C ) and nucleus (N ) of JB6
cells without (a) and with (b ) 20 Amol/L
EGCG treatment for 24 h. Isolation and
analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic
proteins were conducted as previously
described (35). Note that EGCG treatment
promotes nuclear localization of PP-2Acs.
Shown here are typical results of three
independent experiments.

In addition, PP-2A is an important target in EGCG-mediated
chemoprevention.

Materials and Methods
Cell and cell culture. JB6 mouse skin epidermal cell line Cl41 was
cultured in monolayers at 37jC and 5%CO2 using Eagle’s MEM
containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 1%
penicillin and streptomycin. H1299 (p53 / ) and H1080 (p53+/+) lung
cancer cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection were
cultured in MEM with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin
and streptomycin.
Generation of stable transfectants. JB6 Cl41 cells were transfected with
various mock and expression constructs including pCI-neo vector, the
PP-2Acs expression construct, the small hairpin control construct for p53
RNAi (shmock), and the small hairpin p53 silence construct (shp53) using
Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer’s instructions. The stable
transfectants were obtained through G418 selection (400 Ag/mL) or
puromycin selection (2 Ag/mL) and further confirmed by reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis as described before

www.aacrjournals.org

(32). The selected clones of both vector and PP-2A–transfected JB6 Cl41
were cultured in the same conditions described above plus 400 Ag/mL G418.
The selected clones of both shmock and shp53-transfected JB6 C141 cells
were cultured in the same medium conditions except that the 400 Ag/mL
G418 was replaced with 2 Ag/mL puromycin.
Cell treatment. JB6 Cl41, H1299, and H1080 cells or various stable lines
of transfected JB6 cells were seeded onto 100-mm dish, and the cells were
serum starved for 24 h in 0.1% FBS MEM before EGCG treatment. After
starvation, the cells were treated with different concentrations of EGCG
(0–80 Amol/L) in the absence (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 1A) or presence
of 20 ng/mL 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). After 24 h treatment with EGCG and TPA, the cells were harvested for flow cytometry
analysis (32, 33), Western blot analysis (32, 33), and/or assay of phosphatase
activities (33). To inhibit protein serine/threonine phosphatase activities,
JB6 C141 cells were pretreated with 0.01% DMSO or 10 to 200 nmol/L
okadaic acid, followed by different concentrations of EGCG (0, 10, and
20 Amol/L), and 20 ng/mL TPA for an additional 12 h. After treatment, the
cells were harvested for cell flow cytometry and/or Western blot analysis.
The pCI-neo, pCI-PP-2Acs, shmock, and shp53 transfectants were also
seeded onto 100-mm dish. After serum starvation for 24 h in 0.1% FBS and

EGCG Negatively Regulates PP-2A to Promote Apoptosis
400 ug/mL G418 MEM or 2 Ag/mL puromycin, the cells were treated with
different concentrations of EGCG (0–40 Amol/L), in the presence of 20 ng/mL
TPA before harvesting for cell flow cytometry analysis and/or Western blot
analysis. As a control for EGCG treatment, JB6 cells were also treated with
0 to 500 nmol/L Adriamycin for 24 h in the presence of 0.1% FBS MEM.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was conducted as
previously described (32–34). Total proteins were extracted from parent
JB6, H1299, and H1080 cells, or transfected JB6 cells with or without
treatment by okadaic acid, EGCG, and/or TPA, or parent JB6 cells with or
without treatment by Adriamycin. Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were
isolated as previously described (34) except that the nuclear soluble and
insoluble portions are combined. The protein concentration was determined
as described before (32, 33). Fifty or 100 Ag of total proteins, cytoplasmic, or
nuclear proteins were used for each lane of loaded sample. The protein blots
were blocked with 5% milk in TBS buffer (32, 33) overnight at 4jC and then
incubated for 1 h or overnight with antibodies against Bax, p21, total p53
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), puma, noxa, and phospho-p53-Ser-15 and
phospho-p53-Ser-20 (Cell Signaling Technology), Bak and PP-2Acs (Upstate,

Inc.), and h-actin antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:200 to 3,000. The
secondary antibody was anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, or anti-goat IgG
(Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:1,000 to 3,000. Immunoreactivity
was detected as described before (32–34).
Flow cytometry analysis. The apoptosis rate of parent JB6, H1299, and
H1080 cells, or transfected JB6 cells after various treatment was determined
using an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit as previously described
(32, 33). Briefly, the treated cells were trypsinized, washed twice with icecold Dulbecco’s PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the
dark with Annexin V–conjugated FITC and propidium iodide in the binding
buffer provided. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using the
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) as previously described (32, 33).
Assays of protein serine/threonine phosphatase activities. The
protein phosphatase activities in the parent and transfected JB6 cells after
different treatment were assayed as previously described (33) using a kit
from New England Biolabs, Inc.

95% confluence, the cells were fixed in 1% formalin in PBS for 10 min, then
rinsed with PBS thrice, incubated with 10% normal blocking rabbit serum in
PBS for 20 min to suppress nonspecific binding of IgG. The blocked slides
were further incubated with anti–PP-2Acs for 60 min (1:200), followed
by washing thrice with PBS, and then incubated with Texas-red–linked
anti-rabbit IgG (1:250) for 45 min. After three washes in PBS, the slides
were mounted with 90% glycerol in PBS and photographed under Leica
Fluorescence Microscopy.
In vitro phosphorylation of the p53 fusion proteins. The fusion
proteins of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p53 and GST-p53-S15A were
prepared and phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as
previously described (33). Equal amounts of GST-p53 and GST-p53-S15A were
each incubated with DNA-PK in the presence of g-32P-ATP for 30 min at 30jC.
The reaction was stopped by adding 1/5 volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid
(TCA) to precipitate the reaction mixture, which was then dissolved into
40 AL 1  protein phosphatase assay buffer for dephosphorylation assay (33).
In vitro dephosphorylation assays. The in vitro dephosphorylation
assays were conducted as previously described (33, 34).
In vivo dephosphorylation assays. The in vivo dephosphorylation
assays were conducted as described before (33, 34). Briefly, JB6 cells were
labeled with [32P]-Pi (200 ACi/mL) in phosphatase-free DMEM and
subjected to 80 Amol/L EGCG treatment for 4 h in the presence of
20 ng/mL TPA. Then, total proteins were extracted for immunoprecipitation
with an antibody against phospho-p53–Ser-15. The immunoprecipitated
protein complex was mixed with phosphatase reaction buffer and incubated
at 30jC for 30 min. After TCA precipitation, the supernatant fraction was
recovered for counting the release of free 32P in a scintillation counter.
Immunoprecipitated sample with anti-h-actin antibody was also used for
the parallel dephosphorylation assay (mock). The dephosphorylation assay
was conducted in the absence or presence of PP-2A–specific inhibitor,
PP2A-I1; or PP-1–specific inhibitor, PP1-I2; or PP-2B–specific inhibitor, CSA,
or okadaic acid to block both PP-1 and PP-2A.
RT-PCR to detect gene expression for PP-2Acs, p21, Bak, Bax, Puma,
and Noxa. The expression level of the mRNA for PP-2Acs, p21, Bak, Bax,
Puma, and Noxa mRNAs in parent or transfected JB6 cells were detected
with RT-PCR as previously described (33). After treatment, parent or
transfected JB6 C141 cells were used for RNA extraction with RNAeasy kit
(Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was conducted with 450 ng total RNA
and oligo(dT) primers (Promega). The oligonucleotide primers synthesized
by Invitrogen, Inc. were as follows: for PP-2Acs, 5¶-ATGGACGAGAAGGTGTTC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TAACGAACCTTAAG-AGCTAC-3¶
(reverse) with the amplified fragment of 310 bp; for p21, 5¶GTCCAATCCTGGTGATGTCC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GCTCAGACACCAGAGTGCAA-3¶ (reverse) with the amplified fragment of 359 bp; for Bax,
5¶-GGAGACACCTGAGCTGACCT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGAGGAAGTCCAGTGTCCAG-3¶ (reverse) with the amplified fragment of 314 bp; for Bak,
5¶-TACCTCCACCAGCAGGAAC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGTAGACGTACAGGGCCAG-3¶ (reverse) with the amplified fragment of 310 bp;
for Puma, 5¶-GGACGGTCCTCAGCCCTC-3¶ ( for ward) and 5¶CTTGTCTCCGCCGCTCGTAC-3¶ (reverse) with the amplified fragment of
203 bp; for Noxa, 5¶-GGAGTGCACCGGACATAACT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶CAGATTCAGAAGTTTCTG-CCG-3¶ (reverse) with no amplified fragment;
and for h-actin, 5¶-ACATGGCATTGTTACCAAC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶CGTTGCCAATAGTGATGAC-3¶ (reverse) with the amplified fragment of
541 bp. PCR was run 30 cycles with an annealing temperature of 50jC.
Silence of p53, Bak, and PP-2Acs. For stable knockdown of p53
expression in JB6 cells, the pSHAG-MAGIC vector expressing shRNA against
p53 expression and the nonsilencing shRNA pSHAG-MAGIC vector as
negative control were obtained from the Open Biosystem. Transfection of
JB6 cells was performed using a Lipofectamine 2000 agent as described
previously (33, 34). Stably transfected cell clones were selected with
puromycin (2 Ag/mL). For knockdown of Bak and PP-2Acs expression, the
siRNA oligos were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and the
transfection was conducted as previously described (33, 34).
Gel mobility shifting assays. Gel mobility shifting assays were
conducted as previously described (35). The oligos used were as follows:
5¶-GTTGGCTTGCCTGCCTCTGCCTCT-3¶ for mouse Bak gene p53 binding

site and 5¶-GTTCCACCAAAGAAATCCAAAGCT-3¶ for mutated p53 binding
site. Forty micrograms of nuclear extracts prepared from JB6 cells treated
with 40 Amol/L EGCG and 20 ng/mL TPA for 12 h were incubated with
1  105 CPM of 32P-labeled double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides for
30 min at 30jC in a binding shifting buffer (35). For competition
experiments, 50-fold of the unlabeled wild-type or mutant double-stranded
synthetic oligonucleotides were preincubated with the nuclear extracts for
10 min before the labeled probe was added into the reaction. In the
precleared experiments, 10 Ag antibody against p53 was preincubated with
the nuclear extracts on ice for 10 min before addition of the 32P-labeled
oligonucleotides. After the binding reaction, the mixtures were loaded onto
5% native PAGE and detected by autoradiography.
Analysis of transient gene expression. For reporter gene activity, the
constructs of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the Bak gene promoters
with a wild-type or mutant p53 binding sites inserted at 74 were each
introduced into JB6 cells with an internal control plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. Two hours after transfection, the
transfected cells were treated with 20 ng/mL TPA alone or 20 Amol/L
EGCG in the presence of 20 ng/mL TPA for additional 22 h before harvested
for assays of luciferase activity using a kit from Promega as described
previously (33, 34). For p53 dose-dependent response, the Bak-luc construct
containing a wild-type p53 site, and the internal control plasmid plus 0 to
1,000 ng of pCMV-p53 plasmid were cotransfected into both JB6 and H1299
cells, the transfected cells were harvested after 24 h, and the harvested cell
extracts were used for assay of luciferase activity as described above.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. JB6 cells were grown to 95%
confluence, then starved in 0.1% serum overnight, and followed by
treatment with 20 Amol/L EGCG for 24 h in the presence of 20 ng/mL
TPA. Approximately 2.0  107 cells were incubated with 1% formaldehyde
for 10 min at room temperature for crosslinking, which was terminated by
washing the cells with 4 mL of 1.25 mol/L glycine solution. The cells were
further washed with cold PBS twice and then scraped into 1 mL of
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sonication buffer [50 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 8.1), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
and 150 mmol/L NaCl] containing the protease inhibitor cocktail. These
lysates were sonicated 15 times for 10 s each time to generate DNA
fragments that ranged in size from 200 to 1,000 bp. The sheared chromatinlysed extracts were incubated with either 5 Ag of anti-p53 antibody or 5 Ag
of normal IgG overnight at 4jC, and then incubated for an additional
1 h with 30 AL protein A/G agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were
washed by cold ChIP sonication buffer 2 and cold PBS 2, then
suspended in the elution buffer [Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and 1% SDS],
and incubated overnight at 65jC, and an additional 2 h at 55jC with 100 Ag
of protease K to reverse proteins/DNA crosslinks. Finally, these samples
were processed for DNA purification by phenol-chloroform extraction and
ethanol precipitation. PCRs were performed in 25 AL with 1/1,000 of input
DNA or 1/50 of the immunoprecipitates with the following primers:
5¶-CTCTGCCTAGCTGCCTCAATG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GAGACCACCGTCACTTGTCAC-3¶ (reverse), which generates a fragment of 383 bp. As a
positive control, a pair of oligos derived from p21 promoter containing the
p53 binding site were designed as follows: ( forward) 5¶-AGGGTAAAGGCACAGGAGGT-3¶ and (reverse) 5¶-ACAGCTTCTCCAAA-GCAGGA-3¶, which
produces a fragment of 478 bp. PCR was conducted with following
specifications: 94jC 5 min, (94jC 30 s, 52jC 30 s, and 72jC 30 s)  32, 72jC
5 min, and the PCR products were separated on an 1.5% agarose gel and
stained with ethidium bromide.

Results
PP-2A is regulated by EGCG at multiple levels. To investigate
whether EGCG acts on protein serine/threonine phosphatases
during its chemopreventive function, we examined the expression,
activity, and localization of PP-2A after treatment by different

after (right ) glutathione column purification. B, in vitro dephosphorylation assays by PP-2A. The two substrates, GST-p53 and GST-p53-S15A, were labeled with
DNA-PK and precipitated by TCA after labeling. Then equal amount of each protein (2 Ag protein for each sample) was mixed with 1 PP-2A dephosphorylation buffer
and 10 ng PP-2Acs (obtained from Calbiochem, Inc.) in the absence or presence of specific PP-2A inhibitor, PP2A-I1. The mixture was incubated 10 min at 30jC.
After the reaction, the released free 32P was counted. The final results were averaged from three independent experiments in which the free 32P released from
each dephosphorylation reaction was recorded. C, reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP ) to show that PP-2Acs and p53 form interacting complex. JB6 cells were
harvested for extraction of total proteins, which were used for immunoprecipitation with anti–PP-2Acs antibody (1 and 2 ) or anti–total p53 antibody (3 and 4 ). The
immunoprecipitated samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis as described before (32–34). The supernatant represents the sample after
immunoprecipitation. Shown here are typical results of three independent experiments. D, in vivo dephosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 by PP-2A. JB6 cells were labeled
with [32P]-Pi (200 ACi/mL) in phosphatase-free DMEM for 30 min and then subject to 80 Amol/L EGCG treatment for another 4 h in the presence of the [32P]-Pi
(200 ACi/mL). Total proteins were extracted for immunoprecipitation with an antibody against phospho-p53 at Ser-15. The immunoprecipitated protein complexes
were mixed with phosphatase reaction buffer in the presence or absence of various inhibitors and then incubated at 30jC for 10 min. After TCA precipitation, the
supernatant fraction was recovered for counting the release of free 32P in a scintillation counter. Immunoprecipitated sample with antiactin antibody was also used for
the parallel dephosphorylation assay (mock ). The dephosphorylation assays were conducted in the absence (extract ) or presence of PP-1 inhibitor, PP1-I2
(Extract +PP1-I2 ) or 200 nmol/L okadaic acid (Extract +OA ), PP-2A inhibitor, PP2A-I1 (Extract +PP2A-I1 ), and PP-2B inhibitor, 250 nmol/L cyclosporin A
(Extract +CSA ). The results shown here are averaged from three independent experiments. Note that the inhibitor blocking PP-2A but not PP-2B was able to inhibit
f75% dephosphorylation. In contrast, the specific inhibitor for PP-1 only inhibited f25% of dephosphorylation, indicating that in JB6 cells, PP-2A is the major
phosphatase that dephosphorylates p53 at Ser-15. IB, immunoblot.

treatment of 10 and 20 Amol/L EGCG, significant down-regulation
of the PP-2Acs mRNA was observed after the JB6 cells were treated
by 40 to 80 Amol/L EGCG (Fig. 1Aa and Ba, 1). As a comparison,

down-regulation of the PP-2Acs protein (Fig. 1Aa and Ba, 3)
and also PP-2A activity (Fig. 1Ab and Bb). Western blot analysis
revealed that EGCG also down-regulates PP-2A in other cancer
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Although 10 Amol/L EGCG

only caused slight change in the PP-2Acs protein level and activity
(Fig. 1A and B), EGCG at this concentration did cause change
in PP-2Acs localization, and majority of the PP-2Acs was
concentrated to the nuclei of the treated JB6 cells (Fig. 1Ca and
Cb). Under treatment of 80 Amol/L EGCG, however, PP-2Acs
was found released from the nuclei of the treated cells and
moved into the cytoplasm around the nuclei of the treated cells
(Fig. 1Cd). The differential localization induced by physiologic
level of EGCG was further confirmed through differential
fractionation–linked Western blot analysis (Fig. 1Da and Db).
TPA had little effects on EGCG-mediated regulation of PP-2A
(Fig. 1A and B). Thus, EGCG at both physiologic (10–20 Amol/L) or
nonphysiologic concentration (80 Amol/L) regulates PP-2Acs at
different aspects.
EGCG induces p53-dependent apoptosis in JB6 cells.
Previous studies have shown that EGCG-induced p53-dependent
apoptosis in cancer cells (9). To confirm this function of EGCG in
JB6 cells, we first treated JB6 cells with different concentration of
EGCG and examined its role in triggering apoptosis of JB6 cells. As
shown in Fig. 2Aa to Ac, cell flow cytometry analysis revealed that
in the presence of 20 ng/mL TPA, EGCG induced dose-dependent
apoptosis of JB6 cells, whereas TPA alone only caused background
apoptosis. Analysis of EGCG-induced apoptosis in JB6 cells and two
lung cancer cell lines, p53 (+/+) 1080 and p53 ( / ) H1299
cells, revealed that lack of functional p53 distinctly attenuates
EGCG-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2Ba).
To explore if EGCG activates p53-dependent apoptosis in JB6
cells, we have examined the expression level and phosphorylation
status of the tumor suppressor, p53, under treatment of different
concentrations of EGCG. As shown in Fig. 2Bb, under normal
culture condition, the p53 level was barely detectable in JB6 cells.
Treatment of JB6 cells with EGCG from 10 to 40 Amol/L induced
dose-dependent up-regulation of p53 and also dose-dependent
hyperphosphorylation at Ser-15. However, phosphorylation of p53
at Ser-20 was not detectable (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast,
treatment of JB6 cells by Adriamycin induced hyperphosphorylation of p53 at both Ser-15 and Ser-20 of p53 (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). Associated with up-regulation of both total p53 and also

hyperphosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15, the CDK inhibitor, p21, and
the proapoptotic gene, Bak, were also up-regulated at the protein
level (Fig. 2Bb) and mRNA level (Fig. 2Bc) after EGCG treatment. A
mutation from serine to alanine at Ser-15 of p53 caused clearly
reduced induction of Bak in transfected H1299 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). On the other hand, the proapoptotic gene, Bax, was
only slightly up-regulated due to its presence of high background
level in JB6 cells. Examination of EGCG-induced expression of
additional p53 target genes revealed that Puma and Noxa were
hardly detectable in both untreated and treated JB6 cells at protein
levels (Supplementary Fig. S2A). At the mRNA level, however,
although Noxa mRNA was undetectable, the Puma mRNA was
present but the level was lower than Bax or Bak mRNAs
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). As comparison, treatment of JB6 cells
by Adriamycin induced up-regulation of the proteins and mRNAs
for p21, Bak, Bax, and Puma (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D,
respectively). Again, Noxa mRNA and protein were still undetectable (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D). Together, these results
suggest that EGCG induces apoptosis, which is associated with
up-regulation in p53 expression, phosphorylation at Ser15, and Bak
up-regulation.
To confirm that EGCG-induced apoptosis is p53-dependent, we
established stable transfectant JB6 cells to knockdown p53 (shp53);
shmock stable transfectant JB6 cells were also developed as
control. Western blot analysis revealed that f80% p53 was
knocked down through stable expression of the shRNA expression
construct, targeting p53 in comparison with the control construct–
transfected clone (Fig. 2Ca). When the shp53 and shmock
expression constructs–transfected cells were treated with 10 to
40 Amol/L EGCG in the presence of 20 nmol/L/mL TPA, cell flow
cytometry analysis revealed that silence of p53 lead to substantial
suppression of the EGCG-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2Cb). Similarly,
when Bak was knocked down through RNAi (90% knockdown;
Fig. 2Da), EGCG-induced apoptosis of JB6 cells were attenuated
f45% (Fig. 2Db and Dc). These results showed that EGCG-induced
apoptosis in JB6 cells is p53- and Bak-dependent.
Overexpression of PP-2Acs prevents EGCG-induced apoptosis and hyperphosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 in JB6 cells. The

Bb, assays for transient reporter gene expression. JB6 cells were transfected with the Bak-Luc reporter gene (Bak-Luc ) containing one copy of wild-type p53
binding site, or the same construct with the p53 binding site mutated (mBak-Luc ) without or with treatment by TPA (Bak-Luc+TPA and mBAK-Luc+TPA ), or by
both TPA plus EGCG (Bak-Luc +TPA +EGCG and mBAK-Luc+TPA+EGCG ), together with an internal control plasmid as described in the Materials and Methods.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, these cells were harvested for analysis of luciferase activity as described (34). Note that mutation of the p53 binding site inserted in
Bak promoter caused a loss of 50% of the Bak promoter activity and also abolishes the induction by EGCG. Shown here are typical results of three independent
experiments. C, dose-dependent response to exogenous p53 by the Bak-Luc promoter with a copy of p53 binding site transfected into JB6 cells (a) and H1299 cells (b).

fact that EGCG negatively regulates PP-2A suggests that PP-2A may
be an important target for EGCG to exert its chemopreventive
function. To show that this is the case, we stably overexpressed the
cDNA encoding PP-2Acs and the corresponding vector as mock.
The stable clones of JB6 cells were obtained through G418
selection. Overexpression of exogenous PP-2Acs was confirmed
with Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). When the JB6 cells expressing
either the empty pCI-neo vector (Fig. 3Ba) or the PP-2Acs
cDNA (Fig. 3Bb) were treated with various concentrations of
EGCG, cell flow cytometry analysis revealed that cells overexpressing PP-2Acs displayed distinct ability to resist on apoptosis
induced by various concentrations of EGCG in the presence of
20 ng/mL TPA (Fig. 3B–C).
Because EGCG induces p53-dependent apoptosis, the suppression of EGCG-induced apoptosis by PP-2Acs may be derived from
its action on p53. To explore this possibility, we examined the
changes of the total p53 protein and its phosphorylation status at
Ser-15 and other sites induced by EGCG. As shown in Fig. 3D,
introduction of a vector into JB6 cells induced detectable p53
expression and its phosphorylation at Ser-15. EGCG treatment of
the vector-transfected cells enhanced both p53 level and hyperphosphorylation at Ser-15 in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylation at Ser-20 of p53 was not observed (data not shown).
Associated with up-regulation of p53 and phospho-p53 at Ser-15, p21,
and Bak but not Bax were clearly up-regulated by EGCG in vectortransfected cells. Overexpression of PP-2Acs, however, abolished
EGCG-induced up-regulation in p53 expression and phosphorylation at Ser-15, and also prevented up-regulation of p21 and Bak.
This result suggests that PP-2A may directly dephosphorylate p53 at
the Ser-15 to modulate expression of its downstream genes.
PP-2A directly dephosphorylates p53 at Ser-15 in JB6 cells.
To confirm that PP-2A directly dephosphorylates p53 at Ser-15 in
JB6 cells, we first conducted in vitro dephosphorylation assay.
To do so, we prepared GST and mouse p53 fusion proteins, GST-p53
and GST-p53-S15A, and purified these proteins through glutathione
affinity column purification (Fig. 4A). The purified GST-p53
fusion proteins were then labeled with DNA-DPK in the presence
of 32P-g-ATP, and the labeled GST-p53 fusion proteins were used
for in vitro dephosphorylation assays. As shown in Fig. 4B, GST-p53
(labeled at Ser-15) fusion protein phosphorylated by DNA-PK in the
presence of 32P-g-ATP can be dephosphorylated by PP-2A. In
contrast, p53-S15A was not phosphorylated by DNA-DPK and did
not yield detectable free 32P (Fig. 4B). Next, we conducted
coimmunoprecipitation analysis. As shown in Fig. 4C, the proteins
immunoprecipitated by anti–PP-2Acs can be detected with
anti-p53 antibody (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the proteins immunoprecipitated down by anti-p53 antibody also contains PP-2Acs (Fig. 4C,
3). Finally, we conducted in vivo dephosphorylation assay. As
shown in Fig. 4D, the labeled proteins immunoprecipitated by
anti–phospho-53 at Ser-15 antibody contains PP-2Acs, which under
dephosphorylation condition, released free 32P from the immunoprecipitated p53. This release is largely inhibited in the presence of
specific PP-2A inhibitor (f75% inhibition) and, to a much less
degree, by specific PP-1 inhibitor (f25% inhibition). In the
presence of 200 nmol/L okadaic acid, the release of free 32P was
almost completely inhibited (Fig. 4D). In contrast, 250 nmol/L CSA,
a PP-2B inhibitor, had very little effect (only f7% inhibition).
Together, these results suggest that PP-2A is the major phosphatase
dephosphorylating p53 at Ser-15 in JB6 cells.
P53 controls Bak gene in JB6 cells. As described above,
overexpression of PP-2Acs abolished p53 expression and its

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (11). June 1, 2008

hyperphosphorylation at Ser-15. Overexpression of PP-2Acs also
prevented up-regulated-expression of the proapoptotic gene, Bak
(Fig. 3D). These results suggest that p53 may control Bak in JB6
cells. To explore this possibility, we checked the Bak gene sequence
from the gene bank information and found one well-conserved
p53 binding site localized at +2635 to +2654, the first intron of
the Bak gene. This is not surprising because numerous genes are
found containing specific cis-elements in their first introns acting
as core elements of enhancers (36, 37). An oligo containing
this p53 binding site was synthesized (Fig. 5Aa) and used for
gel mobility shifting assay. As shown in lane 1 of Fig. 5Ab, a
complex was found assembled from the extracted JB6 nuclear
p53 and the oligo containing the p53 binding site from Bak
gene. This complex band can be significantly competed off
with unlabeled wild-type oligo (Fig. 5Ab, lane 2) but could not
with unlabeled oligo with the p53 binding site mutated (Fig. 5Ab,
lane 3). Moreover, the nuclear extract precleared with an antibody against p53 could no longer bind to the labeled oligo (Fig. 5Ab,
lane 4), indicating that p53 indeed interacts with Bak gene
p53 binding site. To further confirm that p53 controls Bak in JB6
cells, we conducted three lines of experiments. First, we generated
a Bak promoter with a copy of wild-type or mutant p53 binding site (the oligo containing the p53 binding site found in the
first intron was inserted at 72 of the Bak promoter) and tested
their ability to drive the reporter luciferase gene expression in
the absence or presence of EGCG. As shown in Fig. 5Bb, a
comparison of the luciferase activities between the Bak promoter
wild-type p53 binding site-Luc and the Bak promoter mutant
p53 binding site-Luc revealed that presence of a wild-type or a
mutant p53 binding site in the mouse bak promoter causes a 54%
difference in reporter luciferase activity. Moreover, mutation of
the inserted p53 binding site in the bak promoter also abolishes
the EGCG-mediated inducibility of the luciferase reporter gene
(Fig. 5Bb). Second, we cotransfected the Bak promoter-wildtype p53 binding site-luc and wild-type p53 into JB6 cells, or into
H1299 cells lacking functional p53, and examined the dosedependent induction of luciferase activity by exogenous wild-type
p53. As shown in Fig. 5C, the dose-dependent induction of the
luciferase activity was observed in both types of cells, although
lack of the endogenous p53 in H1299 lead to better inducibility.
Finally, we conducted ChIP assay to show that p53 directly binds to
the Bak gene p53 binding site. As shown in Fig. 5Da, after
crosslinking of the EGCG-treated JB6 cells, the anti-p53 antibody
was able to precipitate down the complex of p53-Bak gene chromatin fragment containing the p53 binding site. After digestion by
protease K, the remaining DNA fragment can be amplified with
specific primers for the endogenous enhancer containing p53
binding site. As a positive control, the anti-p53 antibody was also
able to precipitate down the complex of p53-p21 promoter
sequence containing the p53 binding site (Fig. 5Db). Together,
these results show that p53 regulates Bak gene in JB6 cells.
Inhibition of PP-2A activity with okadaic acid enhances
EGCG-induced p53-dependent apoptosis. Because up-regulation
of PP-2A suppresses EGCG-induced p53-dependent apoptosis, we
next examined whether inhibition of PP-2A activity by a specific
chemical inhibitor, okadaic acid, would regulate EGCG-induced
apoptosis. It is well-established that PP-2A is 100 times more
sensitive than PP-1 to okadaic acid in the in vitro assay due to the
PP-2A structure features (38). Protein phosphatase activity assayed
with directly lysed okadaic acid–treated JB6 extracts revealed that
60 nmol/L okadaic acid can inhibit PP-2A but not PP-1 activity

(Fig. 6A ). This conclusion was derived by comparing the
phosphatase activity in JB6 cells after treatment by 0.01% DMSO,
60 Amol/L or 200 Amol/L okadaic acid without (lanes 1, 2, and 5) or
with addition of thrice of the IC50 concentrations of the specific
inhibitors for either PP-2A (PP2A-I1) or PP-1 (PP1-I2; lane 3, 0.01%
DMSO–treated JB6 cell extract plus 90 nmol/L PP2A-I1; lane 4,

PP1-I2; lane 7, 200 nmol/L okadaic acid–treated JB6 cell extract
plus 6 nmol/L PP1-I2). When PP-2A but not PP-1 was blocked by
60 nmol/L okadaic acid, EGCG-induced apoptosis in the presence
of 20 ng/mL TPA in JB6 cells was significantly enhanced (Fig. 6Ba
and Bb). To determine whether the enhancement of EGCG-induced
apoptosis by inhibition of PP-2A occurs through p53-dependent

mechanism, we examined the expression and phosphorylation
patterns of p53. As shown in Fig. 6C, even in the absence of
EGCG-treatment, inhibition of PP-2A caused slight up-regulation
of total p53 expression and distinct enhancement of p53 hyperphosphorylation at Ser-15. Both 10 and 20 Amol/L EGCG
moderately enhanced expression of total p53 but distinctly
enhanced hyperphosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 (Fig. 6C).
Associated with distinct up-regulation of p53 expression and
phosphorylation at Ser-15 under induction by the inhibition
of PP-2A and also by EGCG, the expression of p21 and Bak
was also up-regulated. These results suggest that PP-2A actively
regulates EGCG-induced apoptosis. EGCG-mediated downregulation of PP-2A is an important aspect for EGCG-induced
p53-dependent apoptosis.

previously described (32–34). Note that

p21, and Bax expression, and also
phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15. D,
schematic diagram to show that PP-2A is
an important target regulated by EGCG
during its chemopreventive action against
carcinogenesis. PP-2A (red ) is actively
involved in dephosphorylation of p53 at
Ser-15. Dephosphorylation of p53 at
Ser-15 favors MDM2-p53 interaction and
sensitizes p53 toward ubiquitination and
degradation pathway. EGCG negatively
regulates PP-2A at the mRNA, protein,
enzyme activity levels, as well
as localization. As a result,
EGCG inhibits PP-2A to promote p53
hyperphosphorylation, which enhances
p53 transactivity to up-regulate Bak
expression, and thus, promotes
p53-dependent apoptosis. The
enhancement of p53 transactivity also
up-regulates p21 to block CDK/cyclin
activity to enhance growth inhibition. Thus,
PP-2A plays an important role in mediating
EGCG-induced cancer prevention.

Discussion
In the present study, we have shown the following: (a) EGCG at
physiologic levels (10 to 20 Amol/L) down-regulates expression of
PP-2Acs at protein and enzyme activity levels and also causes
change in PP-2Acs localization; (b) EGCG at 10 to 40 Amol/L
induces p53-dependent apoptosis of JB6 cells through mitochondrial death pathway; (c) overexpression of PP-2A suppresses
p53-dependent apoptosis; (d) PP-2A directly dephosphorylates
p53 at Ser-15; (e) P53 controls expression of Bak gene; and ( f )
inhibition of PP-2A activity enhances p53-dependent apoptosis.
Together, our results show that EGCG-mediated negative regulation of PP-2A is an important molecular event for the activation of
p53-dependent apoptosis during its chemoprevention against
cancer (Fig. 6D).
EGCG regulates both kinases and serine/threonine PP-2A to
initiate p53-dependent apoptosis. Chemoprevention, which
refers to the use of nontoxic chemical substances to inhibit, delay,
and/or reverse cellular events associated with carcinogenesis, is
regarded as a promising alternative strategy to therapy for the
management of cancer (39). EGCG is a well-known chemopreventive agent. With regard to its functional mechanism,
previous studies have revealed that EGCG regulates various kinases
(1–12). These kinases include three major types of MAP kinases,
ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 kinase, which in most cases convey the
signal to activating protein-1 (1–7), the InB kinases, which directly
control the translocation of the p65 and p50 subunits from
cytoplasm to nucleus through phosphorylation of InB (8, 9), the Akt
kinases, which control the survival pathway through several
downstream targets (7, 10), and other kinases (1–3). Through
these different kinases, EGCG regulates AP-1, NF-nB, and PI3K/
AKT signaling pathways to change expression patterns of the
downstream genes and, therefore, to inhibit cell proliferation and
transformation, and induce apoptosis of the treated cancer cells
(1–3).
In contrast, during EGCG chemoprevention, whether it acts
on protein serine/threonine phosphatases remains largely
unknown. In the present study, we show that EGCG at physiologic
concentrations (10–20 Amol/L) regulates one of the most
important serine/threonine phosphatases, PP-2A. EGCG at
10 Amol/L promotes the nuclear localization of the catalytic
subunit of PP-2A. When its concentration is increased to 20 Amol/
L, EGCG clearly down-regulates the protein level and enzyme
activity of PP-2Acs. At 40 and 80 Amol/L, EGCG also downregulates the mRNA level for PP-2Acs. A search of the PP-2Acs
promoter sequence reveals the presence of multiple cis-elements
for AP-1, NF-nB, and several other transcription factors.5 Knowing
that EGCG regulates AP-1 and NF-nB (1–3), it is not surprising that
EGCG can regulate PP-2Acs mRNA level.
Because PP-2A and PP-1 contributes >90% of total cellular
protein serine/threonine phosphatase activities, and PP-2A
contributes to f0.3% of the total cellular proteins in eukaryotes
(13–15), it is conceivable that down-regulation of PP-2A by EGCG
would have profound consequences. As a major phosphatase,
PP-2A may have many different targets. One of such target is the
tumor suppressor, p53. We show here that PP-2A can directly
dephosphorylate p53 (Fig. 4; see below for more discussion).

induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B–C). Mechanistically, overexpression of
PP-2A greatly attenuates p53 hyperphosphorylation at Ser-15,
which lead to suppression of EGCG-induced up-regulation of Bak
(Fig. 3D). On the other hand, inhibition of PP-2A activity by okadaic
acid enhances p53 hyperphosphorylation at Ser-15 and induced
elevated expression of Bak (Fig. 6C). Together, these results show
that PP-2A is one of the key targets regulated by EGCG in exerting
its chemopreventive effects.
PP-2A directly dephosphorylates p53 at Ser-15 to modulate
p53 function. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is the most
important posttranslational modification on p53 functions (40). At
the present, 17 serine/threonine residues are found regulated by
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (40). Many laboratories have
shown that different signals can activate multiple pathways to
phosphorylate p53 at one or more of these serine/threonine
residues and, thus, lead to profound changes in stability,
transcriptional activity, and apoptotic ability of p53 (40).
Compared with our understanding of p53 phosphorylation by
various protein kinases, much less is known about the dephosphorylation of p53. Nevertheless, the few reports have identified the
specific phosphatases responsible for dephosphorylating p53 at
four specific residues. Long and colleagues (41) have reported that
PP-1 may dephosphorylate p53 at Ser-392 in neonatal rat
cardiomyocyte. Dohoney and colleagues (42) have shown that in
response to DNA damage, protein phosphatases-2A is able to
dephosphorylate p53 at Ser-37 in Molt-4 cells. We previously
reported that PP-1 dephosphorylates p53 at Ser-15 to promote
survival in human lens epithelial cells (43). Recently, we have
shown that PP-1 dephosphorylates both Ser-15 and Ser-37 to
modulate both transcriptional activity and proapoptotic ability of
p53 (33). More recently, Li and colleagues (44) have shown that in
U2OS cells, PP-2A is responsible for dephosphorylation of p53 at
Thr-55 to activate p53. In the present study, we provide evidence to
show that PP-2A can directly dephosphorylate p53 at Ser-15. First,
PP-2Acs and p53 can be coimmunoprecipitated. Moreover, in vitro
labeled p53 at Ser-15 by DNA-PK in the presence of g-32P-ATP
could be dephosphorylated by purified PP-2A. Furthermore, the
pulse-chase labeled p53 when immunoprecipitated with an
antibody against phosphorylated p53 at Ser-15 was largely
dephosphorylated by the coimmunoprecipitated PP-2Acs. These
data indicate that PP-2A can directly dephosphorylate p53 at
Ser-15 in JB6 cells. This conclusion is further supported by the fact
that overexpression of PP-2Acs causes dephosphorylation of p53 at
Ser-15 in JB6 cells (Fig. 3D), and that inhibition of PP-2Acs by
okadaic acid leads to p53 hyperphosphorylation at Ser-15 as
observed in Fig. 6C. Thus, our results show that in JB6 cells, PP-2A
is a major phosphatase that catalyzes dephosphorylation of p53 at
Ser-15 residue, which is contrast to what we previously observed
in human lens epithelial cells where PP-1 acts as a major
phosphatase dephosphorylating p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-37 two
residues (Fig. 4; ref. 33).
In the present studies, our results show that dephosphorylation
of p53 at Ser-15 by PP-2A has distinct effect on p53 function. We
show that p53 can regulate expression of the downstream
proapoptotic gene, bak (Fig. 5; see further discussion below).
Overexpression of PP-2Acs induces hypophosphorylation of p53 at
Ser-15, attenuated expression of bak, and eventual inhibition of
EGCG-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3). Our results are consistent with
previous studies from numerous laboratories including ours where
it was found that dephosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-37 by
PP-1 or at Ser-37 and Thr-55 by PP-2A modulates its transcriptional

EGCG Negatively Regulates PP-2A to Promote Apoptosis

activity on target genes such as Bcl-2, Bax, and p21 (33, 41–44). In
the present study, we also observed that dephosphorylation of p53
at Ser-15 by PP-2A attenuates p21 expression, which is associated
with EGCG-mediated inhibition of cell growth (1–3).
P53 directly controls expression of the proapoptotic
regulator, Bak, to regulate apoptosis. The tumor suppressor,
p53, is a master regulator of apoptosis in many types of cells (40).
As a master regulator of apoptosis in different cells, p53 regulates
apoptosis by two mechanisms. First, it acts as a transcriptional
factor to regulate expression of many genes involved in apoptosis.
One set of such genes are the ones coding for members of the Bcl-2
family including Bcl-2 and Bax (45). Second, p53 could be
translocated into mitochondria where it antagonizes the antiapoptotic ability of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (46). Although it has been
shown that p53 can activate Bak in mitochondria to induce
apoptosis (47) and EGCG induces up-regulation of both p53 and
Bak (48), it remains to be determined whether p53 regulates Bak
gene expression. In the present study, we present several lines of
evidence to show that p53 controls expression of bak, another
important p53 downstream gene mediating apoptosis. First,
analysis on the bak gene sequence reveals the presence of a wellconserved p53 binding site located from +2635 to +2654, in the first
intron of the Bak gene. Gel mobility shifting assays reveal that a
nuclear protein can strongly bind to this conserved p53 binding
site. When the nuclear extracts were precleared with an anti-p53
antibody, the precleared nuclear extract lost most of the ability to
bind to the bak gene oligo containing the p53 binding site. Second,
when a luciferase reporter gene driven by the bak gene promoter
inserted with a copy of the wild-type p53 binding site or a copy of
mutant p53 binding site is transfected into JB6 cells, the reporter
gene activity assays reveal that mutation of the p53 binding site
causes distinct reduction of the reporter luciferase activity
(Fig. 5Bb). Mutation of the p53 binding site in the Bak-Luc
construct also abolishes, to a large degree, the inducing ability of
the reporter gene by EGCG. Third, cotransfection of this Bak
promoter-wild-type p53 binding site-Luc reporter gene with
wild-type p53 expression construct induces a dose-dependent
increase in luciferase activity as tested in both JB6 and H1299 cells.
Finally, ChIP assays confirmed that p53 binds to Bak gene p53
binding site. Together, our results show that p53 regulates Bak
expression in mouse JB6 skin cells. Considering that p53 can
directly activate Bak in mitochondria to induce apoptosis (47), our
demonstration that p53 also controls Bak expression suggest that
the p53-Bak pathway plays an important role in EGCG-mediated
chemoprevention of JB6 cells. This is further supported by the fact
that knockdown of Bak in JB6 cells caused a 45% attenuation of the
EGCG-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Moreover, EGCG regulation of
PP-2A also conveys the signaling pathway to p53-Bak (Fig. 6D).
The molecular mechanisms by which PP-2A regulates
carcinogenesis. As mentioned above, PP-2A exists in cells in two
major forms: holoenzyme and core enzyme (16, 22, 38). The core
enzyme consists of a 36-kDa catalytic C subunit and a 65-kDa
regulatory A subunit (22). The holoenzyme is composed of a core
enzyme to which one of several regulatory B subunits is bound (22).
The A and C subunits exist in two isoforms: Aa and Ah, and Ca
and Ch, respectively. The B subunits fall into four subfamilies,
designated B, B’, B’’, or B’’’, which seem unrelated by sequence
alignment. The B family has four members: Ba, Bh, Bg, and By. The
B¶ family consists of five genes encoding B’a, B’h, B’g, B’y, and B’q as
well as several isoforms and splice variants. The B’’ family has four
members, designated PR48, PR59, PR72, and PR130. The latter two

www.aacrjournals.org

are splicing variants of the same gene. The B’’’ family has two
members: striatin and SG2NA (19).
Both A and B subunits of PP-2A are implicated in carcinogenesis.
For the scaffold A subunit, it was found that the gene encoding the
Ah subunit of PP-2A is mutated or deleted in 15% of primary lung
and colon cancers (24). Calin and colleagues (25) have reported
that both the Aa and Ah subunit isoforms are genetically altered
in a variety of primary human cancers. These results suggest that
PP-2A seems to act as a tumor suppressor. Based on the location of
the mutated amino acids in the intrarepeat loops or nearby in Aa
or Ah, it has been suggested that the mutant A subunits are likely
defective in binding B and/or C subunits (19, 26, 27). As a result, the
specific PP-2A activity needed in these tissues is diminished and
the normal functions of certain targets or signaling pathways are
interrupted. For example, PP-2A is colocalized with Bcl-2 in
mitochondria to modulate Bcl-2 function. Lack of the functional
scaffold A subunits may lead to absence or insufficiency of the
mitochondrial PP-2A activity and, thus, favor the Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation at Ser-70 (49) and inhibition of cancer cell
apoptosis, allowing accumulation of cancer cells for tumor
formation. On the other hand, mutation of the scaffold A subunits
would leave more unbound catalytic subunit of PP-2A, a situation
similar to overexpression of PP-2Acs. The free PP-2Acs could move
into nucleus and negatively regulates p53 function through
dephosphorylation as we have shown in the present study, leading
to attenuation of p53-dependent apoptosis and further enhancement of tumor development.
Certain members of the regulatory B, B’, B’’, or B’’’ family
subunits are also involved in regulation of cancer development.
In this regard, numerous previous studies have shown that PP-2A
interacts with the SV40 small antigen (ST), and such interaction is
essential for transformation of certain human cells. Yu and
colleagues (28) reported that the transformation of primary human
diploid fibroblasts and of mesothelial cells in culture depends on
both SV40 large T and small T. Moreover, they found that inhibition
or alteration of PP-2A by SV40 small antigen is required for cell
transformation. Similar results were reported by Hahn and
colleagues (29) using human fibroblasts and human embryonic
kidney cells. At the molecular level, the SV40 small antigen
displaces the B family subunits of PP-2A and binds to both A and C
subunits to inhibit PP-2A activity (22). The importance of the B
family members in tumor suppression is further revealed by a
recent study where Chen and colleagues (50) have discovered that
suppression of the B family regulatory subunit, B56g, inhibits
PP-2A–specific phosphatase activity in human embryonic kidney
epithelial cells immortalized by SV40 large T antigen, hTERT, and
H-RAS and confers these cells anchorage-independent growth and,
thus, leads to formation of tumors.
Although accumulated evidence suggests that both A and B
subunits of PP-2A are involved in regulation of carcinogenesis, it
remains to be determined if the catalytic subunit of PP-2A is
directly involved in regulation of cancer development. In the
present study, we present evidence to show that the catalytic
subunit of PP-2A is also involved in regulation of carcinogenesis.
Overexpression of PP-2Acs blocks EGCG-induced apoptosis,
which is mediated through the p53-Bak pathway. Inhibition of
p53-dependent apoptosis could interrupt the dynamic homeostasis between cell proliferation and cell death, thus promoting cell
transformation. Indeed, our unpublished results suggest that
overexpression of the catalytic subunit for PP-2A promotes cell
transformation.
