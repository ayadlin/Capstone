ABSTRACT
The Akt/mTORC1 pathway plays a central role in the activation of Warburg
effect in cancer. Here, we present for the first time that halofuginone (HF) treatment
inhibits colorectal cancer (CRC) growth both in vitro and in vivo through regulation
of Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. Halofuginone treatment of human CRC cells
inhibited cell proliferation, induced the generation of reactive oxygen species and
apoptosis. As expected, reduced level of NADPH was also observed, at least in part
due to inactivation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in pentose phosphate
pathway upon HF treatment. Given these findings, we further investigated metabolic
regulation of HF through Akt/mTORC1-mediated aerobic glycolysis and found that HF
downregulated Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. Moreover, metabolomics delineated
the slower rates in both glycolytic flux and glucose-derived tricarboxylic acid cycle
flux. Meanwhile, both glucose transporter GLUT1 and hexokinase-2 in glycolysis were
suppressed in CRC cells upon HF treatment, to support our notion that HF regulates
Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway to dampen glucose uptake and glycolysis in CRC cells.
Furthermore, HF retarded tumor growth in nude mice inoculated with HCT116 cells,
showing the anticancer activity of HF through metabolic regulation of Akt/mTORC1
in CRC.

INTRODUCTION

as protein kinase B (PKB), which is overexpressing in
a number of cancers including colorectal cancer, plays
a key role in multiple cellular processes such as glucose
metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription and
cell migration [3]. Akt activates an array of downstream
factors through phosphorylation and then regulates cellular
metabolism which is rewired in cancer cells [4]. Of note,
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1),
is led by Akt through phosphorylation at Ser 2448. It has
been reported the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling components
were highly activated in glandular elements of colorectal

More than 1.2 million cases are diagnosed with
colorectal cancer (CRC) every year, and more than 600 000
die from the disease worldwide. CRC is responsible for
8% of all cancer deaths [1]. In United States, CRC is the
second leading cause of death from cancer among adults
[2]. As evidenced by genetic modifications, environmental
impacts, diet and lifestyles, the underlying mechanisms
of CRC have been intensively studied. Akt, also known

carcinoma and colorectal adenomas with high-grade
intraepithelial neoplasia [5], indicating that inhibitors of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling may serve as potential antiCRC agents.
The cellular metabolism could be regulated by
Akt/mTORC1 and the downstream effectors. As a
central activator of Warburg effect, mTORC1 can induce
glycolytic enzymes in cancer cells [6]. The p70S6K
controls lipid/sterol synthesis and switches glucose
metabolism from glycolysis to pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP) in cancer cells [7]. It is well known that oxidative
arm of PPP is one of the major pathways for NADPH
(the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate) production. NADPH is a strong reducing
agent which can react with reactive oxygen species
(ROS), allowing cancer cells to escape apoptosis [8].
Thus, activated p70S6K regulates redox state of cancer
cells and promotes cancer cell growth. 4EBP1 is another
well characterized mTORC1 downstream factor which
inhibits the initiation of protein translation by binding and
inactivating eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E). Active mTOR regulates 4EBP1 inhibition, increasing
glucose uptake and glycolysis [9]. Therefore, PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway is thought to be very important
for glucose and lipid metabolism in cancer cells. This
pathway activates aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect),
leading to glucose being avidly consumed by cancer cells
for energy demands and survival [10, 11].
Halofuginone (HF) is a derivative of the febrifugine
which can be extracted from the Chinese herb Dichroa
febrifuga Lour. (Changshan in Chinese) (Figure 1A)
[12]. It has been used as anti-coccidial drug in animal
husbandry for many years [13]. In the last two decades,
HF has gained attention for its potential therapeutic
effects in fibrotic disease by inhibiting alpha-1 type I
collagen gene expression and collagen synthesis [14].
HF also has anticancer activity in bladder carcinoma
by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis through
matrix metalloproteinase-2 [15, 16], prostate cancer
[17], hepatocellular carcinoma [18], and also modulates
the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling
pathway to inhibit acute promyelocytic leukemia as well
as melanoma bone metastases [13, 19]. Particularly, HF
has also been found to inhibit Th17 cell differentiation
by activating the amino acid starvation response for
regulating Stat3-dependent Th17 effector function and
reducing established autoimmune inflammation [20, 21].
However, to our best knowledge, whether HF inhibits
tumor growth in CRC has not been reported. The aim
of this study, therefore, is to investigate the anticancer
activity of HF in CRC through the inhibition of Akt/
mTORC1 signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Glucose
metabolism and lipid profiles mediated by Akt/mTORC1
signaling pathway in CRC cells upon HF treatment were
also depicted by applying metabolomics and lipidomics
based on mass spectrometry.

Halofuginone treatment inhibits proliferation and
induces cell cycle arrest in G1/G0 phase
The effect of HF in CRC cells was examined
by performing MTT, colony formation, cell cycle and
apoptosis assays as well as measurement of ROS and
NADPH levels. As shown in Figure 1B, treatment with
increasing concentrations (5 to 160 nM) of HF reduced
CRC cell viability compared with the untreated control
cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. A sharp
decline in cell viability was also observed with increase
of HF concentrations. The IC50 values were calculated to
be 24.83 nM, 5.82 nM, 40.76 nM, 47.61 nM and 60.89
nM for SW480, HCT116, SW620, HT29 and DLD-1
respectively, after 48 h-treatment. In addition, to further
test HF toxicity in normal cells, we used non-transformed
rat small intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 and human
non-tumorigenic liver cell line MIHA treated with HF,
and calculated IC50 values as 205.7 nM and 261.9 nM
for IEC-6 and MIHA respectively, after 48 h-treatment,
indicating that HF exerts relatively low toxicity to these
two non-tumorigenic cell lines (Figure 1C). Colony
formation assay was also conducted for examining the
effect of HF on CRC cell survival in vitro. HF treatment
dose-dependently reduced cancer cell survival rates
(Figure 1D). Furthermore, the effect of HF on cell cycle
progression was tested in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines
by PI staining, followed by FACS analysis. As shown in
Figure 1E, after HF treatment for 12 h, a dose-dependent
arrest occurred in the G1/G0 phase of the CRC cells,
indicating that the inhibitory effect of HF on CRC cell
proliferation might be correlated with the arrest of G1/G0
cell cycle progression.

Halofuginone induces apoptosis, increases ROS
and decreases NADPH levels
In the cell cycle distribution analysis, sub-G1
peaks in two cell lines also revealed that HF could induce
apoptosis (Figure S1). To further determine the effect
of HF-induced apoptosis, annexin V/PI dye staining
was performed for quantitative analysis of the apoptotic
cell percentage in both cell lines treated with increasing
concentrations of HF for 12 h. As shown in Figure 2A,
HF treatment increases the percentage of both early and
late apoptotic cells compared with the untreated control.
Consistently, HF treatment profoundly increased the
expression of cleaved Caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in a
dose-dependent manner as demonstrated by Western blot
analysis (Figure 2B). The induction of apoptosis, at least
in part due to ROS generation, has been implicated [22].
Therefore, we tested whether HF treatment can enhance

ROS formation in CRC cells. After HF treatment for 12
h, CRC cells produced more ROS than control group
(Figure 3A). In particular, 20 nM HF pronouncedly
elevated ROS levels in both SW480 and HCT116 cell
lines. Co-treatment with N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) fully
reversed the HF-induced increase in ROS and cell death
(Figures S2 and S3). To further evaluate mitochondriaderived ROS production, we detected mitochondrial
marker voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) located
on the outer mitochondrial membrane and found that HF
treatment markedly augmented VDAC protein levels
(Figure 3B). Based on the ROS results, we also measured
the reducing power NADPH production and observed the
increased ratios of [NADP+]/[NADPH] in both SW480
and HCT116 cell lines in agreement with elevated ROS
levels (Figure 3C). To further identify which metabolic
enzyme generating NADPH is affected by HF treatment,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, EC:
1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD,
EC: 1.1.1.44) in oxidative branch of PPP, malic enzyme
(ME1, EC: 1.1.1.40) in pyruvate metabolism and isocitrate
dehydrogenase (IDH1, EC: 1.1.1.42) in tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle were examined. Surprisingly, only G6PD was
pronouncedly downregulated, which could attenuate the
power of scavenging ROS (Figure 3D and Figure S4).

metabolites in TCA cycle was also analyzed by using
gas chromatography mass spectrometry. As a result, the
reduced intermediate metabolites in TCA cycle were
observed upon HF treatment in HCT116 cells. Scrambling
of carbon from glucose was detected in citrate, fumarate
and malate with different scrambled labeling patterns (e.g.,
m+2 and m+4 isotopologues in Figure 4D). Interestingly,
the m+2 isotopologues of these three metabolites are the
most abundant in the isotopologues of each metabolite
because acetyl-Coenzyme A labelled with two 13C
enters TCA cycle from glycolytic shunt. Due to a broad
effect correlated with glucose metabolism, we further
investigated the possibility of glucose uptake altered by
HF treatment. As a result, glucose transporter GLUT1
was found to be downregulated in CRC cells upon HF
treatment (Figure S6), indicating that glucose uptake was
also inhibited as an upstream event. In addition, it is well
known that glucose is one of the main carbon sources for
lipid biosynthesis which could be regulated by p70S6K.
Thus, we further profiled lipid species of cancer cells under
influence of HF treatment by using ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography Orbitrap XL mass spectrometry.
As a result, up to 49 lipid species in HCT116 cells
covering phosphatidylcholine, ceramide, sphingomyelin,
phosphatidylglycerol,
phosphatidylethanolamine,
phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic
acid were downregulated by HF treatment (Figure S7).
All of the lipids were tentatively identified by highly
accurate masses with mass error of less than 3 ppm in
high resolution mass spectrometry by searching against
METLIN Metabolite Database. The lipid profiling was
consistent with lower expression of fatty acid synthase
(FAS) which is an enzyme encoded by the FASN gene in
human (Figure S8).

Halofuginone downregulates Akt/mTORC1
signaling pathway, slows glycolysis and inhibits
lipid biosynthesis
As mentioned above, HF inhibited cell proliferation,
induced ROS and apoptosis. We also reasoned how HF
treatment regulates metabolic pathways to exert anticancer
activity against CRC. Given that Akt/mTORC1 pathway
plays a central role in the activation of Warburg effect
for cancer cell survival [6, 23], we further asked whether
HF could repress aerobic glycolysis via Akt/mTORC1
signaling pathway in CRC cells. After treatment for 12
h, HF resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Akt,
mTORC1 and p70S6K while increased phosphorylation
of 4EBP1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A). To
further delineate glycolytic flux and glucose-derived TCA
cycle flux in CRC cells, we used [U-13C6]-glucose as an
isotopic tracer in feeding cancer cells with or without
HF treatment for 12 h. Metabolomics in combination
with isotope labeling technique by using ultrahighperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry revealed reduced intermediate metabolites
in glycolysis (Figure 4B). To further test which glycolytic
enzyme is affected by HF treatment, we assayed protein
expressions of hexokinase 2 (HK-II), M2 isoform of
pyruvate kinase (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Intriguingly,
only sharp decrease of HK-II was observed (Figure 4C
and Figure S5). The isotopic patterns of intermediate

Halofuginone treatment retards tumor growth in
xenograft-bearing nude mice
Next, we tested the ability of HF to retard tumor
growth in vivo. Nude mice were subcutaneously injected
with HCT116 cells and on 5th day after tumor inoculation
the mice daily received saline or HF (0.1 mg/kg/day)
intraperitoneally for 14 consecutive days. After 14 days of
administration, the animals were euthanized to compare
tumor burden between vehicle (saline treatment) and HFtreated groups. The HF treatment significantly retarded
tumor growth in nude mice as measured by tumor volume
while body weight was unaffected (Figures 5A and 5B).
Moreover, tumor weight and size in HF-treated group
are markedly less than the vehicle group (Figures 5C,
5D and 5E). To further define the mechanism of tumor
growth inhibition in vivo, the TUNEL apoptotic assay
was performed on tumor tissues. As can be seen in Figure
5F, TUNEL staining showed that HF treatment induced
significant apoptosis in tumors, as shown by the stronger
red fluorescence labeled anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody.

We also validated the Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway
in vivo upon HF treatment. The visualization indicated
decreased staining of phosphorylated Akt, mTORC1 and
p70S6K, and increased staining of phosphorylated 4EBP1
in HF treated group compared to the vehicle group (Figure
5G and Figure S9), in line with the in vitro results.

marker VDAC in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines indicated
that the elevated mitochondria-derived ROS production
might contribute to cell apoptosis, as previously reported
[26-29]. As expected, the reducing power NADPH
significantly decreased in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines
upon HF treatment, which might be at least partially
caused by the inhibition of G6PD [30]. G6PD, as the first
and rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, can be inactivated to
reduce NADPH production and biosynthesis, like tumor
suppressor gene p53 [31]. Therefore, HF can also dampen
oxidative branch of PPP which is stimulated by p70S6K
[7]. In this regard, how HF guards glucose metabolism
should be further interrogated for a better understanding
of the underlying metabolic mechanism.
Akt/mTORC1 pathway is a crucial player in CRC
development and some of the inhibitors of mTORC1
has been tested in clinical trials [32], suggesting that
inhibition of Akt/mTORC1 would be an attractive
target in CRC therapy. As one of the main signaling
pathways, Akt/mTORC1 signaling triggers Warburg
effect and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells
[33-35]. In other words, oncogenic processes give rise
to rewired metabolism focused upon Warburg effect and

DISCUSSION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant neoplasm
affecting the lower gastrointestinal tract, awaiting novel
drugs for selectively killing CRC [24]. In the functional
examination of this study, we found that HF has high
toxicity to CRC cells with the lowest concentration of 5.82
nM as IC50 in HCT116 cells after 48 h-treatment. But on
the other hand, HF displays relatively low toxicity to the
tested non-tumorigenic intestinal epithelial cells or liver
cells by MTT assay. This compound exerted anticancer
activity through inhibition of cancer cell proliferation,
induction of ROS and apoptosis in vitro, in line with the
effect of HF in breast cancer [25]. In CRC cells, HFinduced cell death is rescued by the antioxidant NAC.
Additionally, the augmented expression of mitochondrial

Figure 6: The proposed metabolic mechanism modulated by HF treatment in CRC cells. HF can downregulate Akt/

mTORC1 signaling pathway and repress Warburg effect, particularly, inhibit GLUT1 and HK-II through activation of 4EBP1. Accordingly,
the glycolytic flux and TCA cycle flux are downregulated. Meanwhile, HF can inhibit the downstream of mTORC1 p70S6K for dampening
PPP and lipid biosynthesis.

the pentose shunt, providing higher levels of reducing
activities for cancer cell proliferation, like oncogenic
effects mediated by Nrf2, TAp73 [36, 37]. In CRC,
glucose consumption and lipid metabolism have also
been promoted by oncogenic alterations for tumor growth
[38, 39]. In this regard, the anticancer activities of ideal
drugs are expected to inhibit oncogenic effects as well
as suppress glucose metabolism and lipid biosynthesis
in cancer cells. Therefore, we further investigated
how HF treatment modulates Warburg effect via Akt/
mTORC1 signaling pathway. Of particular interest is that
HF could downregulate Akt/mTORC1 pathway in both
SW480 and HCT116 cell lines. More importantly, the
downstream effectors of mTORC1 were also modulated
by HF treatment in CRC cell lines. The p70S6K is
one of the effectors of mTORC1, which can activate
PPP; while another effector 4EBP1 inhibits glucose
uptake and glycolysis. Phosphorylation of p70S6K
was downregulated while phosphorylation of 4EBP1
was upregulated, coupling with slower glycolytic rate,
suggesting that HF exerts anti-CRC through suppression
of Warburg effect. The reduced glucose-derived TCA
cycle flux suggested that carbon source from glucose has
been significantly inhibited by HF treatment. Surprisingly,
glucose transporter GLUT1 and the enzyme HK-II
which catalyzes the first committed step of glycolysis,
were pronouncedly inhibited by HF treatment in a dosedependent manner, revealing that the upstream events of
glucose metabolism could be mediated by Akt/mTORC1
signaling upon HF treatment. Regarding the growing
evidence that HK-II mediates Warburg effect [40] and HKII is phosphorylated by Akt associated with mitochondria
[33], HF treatment in CRC could repress Warburg
effect and might also disturb mitochondrial metabolism.
An intriguing study shows that tumor initiation and
maintenance of lung cancer and breast cancer can be
inhibited by ablating HK-II using conditional knockout
mice [41], postulating that HK-II could be a key target
for HF in treating cancers. Therefore, how HF treatment
exactly modulates glucose uptake and HK-II in CRC still
needs to be further explored. In addition, lipid biosynthesis
mediated by p70S6K activity in Akt/mTORC1 pathway
was also found to be downregulated upon HF treatment
in CRC cells. Indeed, lipid biosynthesis or lipid droplet
formation plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and
tumor growth [42-44], which tightly links to mTOR
signaling [45-47]. In short, HF could downregulate
p70S6K activity for suppression of oxidative PPP and
lipid biosynthesis. Together, we propose the metabolic
mechanism in CRC cells treated with HF for its anticancer
activity (Figure 6).
Inhibitory effects of HF on tumor growth were
also validated in xenograft-bearing nude mice. The
Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway was confirmed as the
metabolic mechanism of this compound in CRC. Notably,
in the animal model, there was no significant change in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

body weight in HF-treated mice compared to vehicle
group, indicating that HF exerts low toxicity to normal
cells which was also demonstrated by MTT assay in IEC6 and MIHA cell lines. In recent studies, HF was found
to inhibit phosphorylation of Smad3 via PI3K/Akt and
MAPK/ERK pathways in muscle cells [48], and HF can
block TGF-β signaling for inhibition of the establishment
and progression of melanoma bone metastases [19].
These reports indicate that the inhibition of Akt/mTORC1
signaling would not be the sole pathway functioned by
HF. Nonetheless, a highlight of our findings with HF
was its activity to inhibit cell proliferation and retard
tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo through metabolic
transformation involving the Akt/mTORC1 pathway.
Thereby, the Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway altering
glucose metabolism and lipid biosynthesis could be
targeted by HF treatment in CRC.
In summary, HF was used to treat CRC for the
first time in cells and animal models. The Akt/mTORC1
signaling pathway coupling with metabolic pathways was
elucidated to indicate that HF inhibits cell proliferation and
induces apoptosis, at least partially due to, the inhibition of
Akt/mTORC1. Particularly, GLUT1 and HK-II were found
to be markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner,
which might be associated with metabolic reprogramming
modulated by HF treatment. Furthermore, the experiments
in nude mice inoculated with human CRC cells validated
the therapeutic effect of HF, providing direct evidence to
support our notion that HF exerts anticancer activity via
Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study
reveals potential therapy of HF against CRC.

h at room temperature, the membrane was then incubated
with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies
against VDAC (D73D12), phosphor-mTOR (Ser2448),
phosphor-p70S6 Kinase (Thr389), phosphor-4EBP1
(Thr37/46), phosphor-Akt (Ser473), Akt (pan) (C67E7),
4EBP1, p70S6 Kinase (49D7), mTOR (7C10), cleavedPARP, cleaved-caspase 3, GLUT1 (D3J3A), fatty acid
synthase (C20G5) and β-actin were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). The membrane
was incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature. HRP-goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, USA). Goat
anti-mouse IgG-HRP secondary antibody was purchased
from San Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, USA). All
antibodies were diluted in TBS-Tween 20 containing 5%
dry milk. The immune-reactive proteins were detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using X-ray film and
ECL reagent.

Colony formation assay
CRC cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates at a
density of 1×105 cells per well in 2 mL medium. Treatment
with various concentrations of HF for 12 to 16 days
until individual cells formed distinctly visible colonies.
Thereafter, cells were stained with 50% methanol solution
of 2% Methylene Blue. After washing, plates were
air dried and digital images were taken. Independent
experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cell cycle analysis
The cell cycle phase distribution was determined
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
of cellular DNA content. The cells were treated with
different concentrations of HF for 12 h and then harvested
by trypsinization and re-suspended in 200 μL PBS. The
cells were fixed in 800 μL cold 100% ethanol, votexed,
and then stored at ‒20°C overnight. The fixed cells were
washed twice with PBS, re-suspended in 500 μL of PBS
containing 5 μL RNase (10 µg mL‒1) and incubated for
30 min in 37°C bath. The cells were stained with 50 μL
propidium iodide (PI, 1 mg mL‒1) for 5 to 10 min on ice in
dark. The fluorescent signal was detected through the FL2
channel and the proportion of DNA in different phases was
analyzed using ModFit LT version 3.1 (Verity Software
House, Topsham).

Quantitative analysis of mRNA levels
Total RNA was isolate from SW480 or HCT116 cells
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were prepared
by reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed using the Quantitect SYBR
green PCR Master mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with 1
µL cDNA in a final volume of 10 µL and the following
primers at a final concentration of 1000 nM. Primers
for Glut1 were 5’- TGGCATCAACGCTGTCTTCT-3’
(forward) and 5’- CTAGCGCGATGGTCATGAGT-3’
(reverse).
Primers
for
G6PD
were
5’TGCATGAGCCAGATAGGCTG-3’ (forward) and 5’GGTAGTGGTCGATGCGGTAG-3’ (reverse). Primers
24158

Oncotarget

for HK-II were 5’- ACAAATTTCCGGGTCCTGCT-3’
(forward) and 5’- TGAGGAGGATGCTCTCGTCCA-3’
(reverse).
Amplification of Glut1, G6PD and HK-II cDNAs
was performed using the LightCycler 2000 instrument
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The cycling conditions
comprised a denaturation step for 15 minutes at 95°C,
followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 15
seconds), annealing (59°C for 20 seconds), and extension
(72°C for 15 seconds). After amplification, a melting curve
analysis was performed with denaturation at 95°C for 5
seconds, then continuous fluorescence measurement from
70°C to 95°C at 0.1°C/second. Each sample was amplified
in duplicate.

Animal Subjects in Teaching and Research of Hong Kong
Baptist University and according to the Regulations of the
Department of Health, Hong Kong SAR, China. HCT116
cells (3 × 106 cells/100 µL) were suspended in PBS and
inoculated subcutaneously into the left flank of each
mouse and tumor growth was monitored regularly. Once
tumors were palpable, (~100 mm3), mice were divided at
random into two groups within 6 mice in each group: (i)
Vehicle group, normally fed, receiving daily i.p. saline;
(ii) HF group, normally fed, receiving daily i.p. HF (0.1
mg/kg/day) dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
The tumors were measured with calipers every 2 days,
and the tumor volumes were calculated by the following
formula: a2×b×0.4, where “a” is the smallest diameter and
“b” is the diameter perpendicular to “a”. Other indicators
of general health, such as body weight, feeding behavior,
and motor activity of each animal were also monitored.
After administration of HF or saline for two weeks, the
mice were euthanized, and the tumor xenografts were
immediately dissected, weighted, stored and fixed.

Measurement of cellular ROS levels
Intracellular ROS levels were assayed using DCFHDA as described previously [49]. Briefly, following
exposure to different concentrations of HF for 12 h, CRC
cells were counted to determine live cell concentration.
Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 250 g for
5 min and washed once with washing buffer. The cell
pellet was then re-suspended in DMEM containing 20
µM DCFH-DA. Cell suspensions were then incubated
for 30 min at 37°C under constant agitation. After
washing twice with washing buffer, the cells were resuspended in 1 mL of washing buffer (PBS containing
10 mM dextrose). Fluorescence was recorded using a
96-well plate reader operating at an excitation/emission
wavelength of 485 nm/530 nm (EnVision 2104 Multilabel
Reader, PerkinElmer). Mean fluorescence values of
DCFH-DA-loaded cells were corrected by subtracting the
autofluorescence background.

Immunofluorescence assay and TdT-mediated
dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay
Xenograft tumors were resected immediately
and fixed in 10% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde
at 4 °C for 24 h. Selected samples were embedded
in paraffin, sectioned and stained with phosphor-Akt
(Ser473), phosphor-mTOR (Ser2448), phosphor-p70S6
Kinase (Thr389), phosphor-4EBP1 (Thr37/46). All
primary antibodies were used for dilution at 1:100. After
overnight incubation at 4°C, the sections were incubated
with flurochrome-conjugated secondary antibody for 1
h and stained with DAPI for 10 min. The sections were
then mounted with DPX mountant (Sigma, 317616)
for analysis. For the TUNEL assay, sections were
deparafinnized and apoptotic cells were detected using the
in situ BrdU-Red DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) assay kit
(Abcam) and counterstained with DAPI.

Measurement of [NADP+]/[NADPH] Ratio
[NADP+]/[NADPH] ratios in CRC cell lines
treated with HF were measured according to the protocol
of [NADP+]/[NADPH] Quantification Kit (MAK038,
Sigma). According to the NADPH standards, the
concentration of NADPtotal or NADPH can be expressed
in pmole per 106 cells. The ratio of [NADP+]/[NADPH]
was calculated by ([NADPtotal] – [NADPH])/[NADPH].

Metabolic flux analysis and lipidomics
[U-13C6]-glucose was used to feed cancer cells for
metabolic flux analysis (MFA). Ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLCMS/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/
MS) were employed for MFA. Meanwhile, ultrahighperformance liquid chromatography Orbitrap XL mass
spectrometry was utilized for lipidomics analysis
without labeling in cell culture. The details of metabolite
extraction and chromatographic separation coupled
with mass spectrometric conditions are described in the
Supplementary Information.

Xenograft studies
BALB/c nude mice, female, 6-week old, were
obtained from the Laboratory Animal Services Centre,
The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Mice were kept at
room temperature 23 ± 2 °C with an alternating 12 h lightdark cycle, and were allowed access to food and water ad
libitum. All of the experimental protocols were carried out
with the approval of the Committee on Use of Human and
