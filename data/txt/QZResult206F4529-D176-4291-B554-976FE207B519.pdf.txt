Abstract
Blocking the oncoprotein murine double minute 2 (MDM2)–p53 protein–protein interaction has long been
considered to offer a broad cancer therapeutic strategy, despite the potential risks of selecting tumors harboring
p53 mutations that escape MDM2 control. In this study, we report a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the MDM2–
p53 interaction, SAR405838 (MI-77301), that has been advanced into phase I clinical trials. SAR405838 binds to
MDM2 with Ki ¼ 0.88 nmol/L and has high speciﬁcity over other proteins. A cocrystal structure of the SAR405838:
MDM2 complex shows that, in addition to mimicking three key p53 amino acid residues, the inhibitor captures
additional interactions not observed in the p53–MDM2 complex and induces refolding of the short, unstructured
MDM2 N-terminal region to achieve its high afﬁnity. SAR405838 effectively activates wild-type p53 in vitro and in
xenograft tumor tissue of leukemia and solid tumors, leading to p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis.
At well-tolerated dose schedules, SAR405838 achieves either durable tumor regression or complete tumor growth
inhibition in mouse xenograft models of SJSA-1 osteosarcoma, RS4;11 acute leukemia, LNCaP prostate cancer,
and HCT-116 colon cancer. Remarkably, a single oral dose of SAR405838 is sufﬁcient to achieve complete tumor
regression in the SJSA-1 model. Mechanistically, robust transcriptional upregulation of PUMA induced by
SAR405838 results in strong apoptosis in tumor tissue, leading to complete tumor regression. Our ﬁndings provide
a preclinical basis upon which to evaluate SAR405838 as a therapeutic agent in patients whose tumors retain wildtype p53. Cancer Res; 74(20); 5855–65. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Although the tumor suppressor function of p53 can be
inactivated through gene mutation or deletion (1), p53 is rarely
mutated in some forms of human cancer, and this suggests
alternative mechanisms for inhibition of the p53 function. The
oncoprotein murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is a primary
inhibitor of wild-type p53 (2–5). Upon direct binding, MDM2
induces degradation of p53 by functioning as an E3 ligase and
blocks the p53 transactivation domain, rendering p53 ineffective as a transcriptional factor (2–5). MDM2 is overexpressed in
many types of human cancers through either gene ampliﬁcation or other mechanisms (6) and contributes to oncogenesis.

Activation of the powerful p53 tumor suppressor function by
blocking the MDM2–p53 interaction using small-molecule
MDM2 inhibitors is being intensely pursued as a new cancer
therapeutic strategy (7–14).
We have previously reported the design of MI-219 as a potent
MDM2 inhibitor (8). Although MI-219 demonstrates clear
mechanism-based antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo and
is well tolerated in extensive toxicity evaluations in animals, it
is not suitable for clinical development. In particular, high
doses (300 mg/kg) and an intense schedule (twice daily) are
needed for MI-219 to achieve strong antitumor activity in vivo.
Our optimization efforts have resulted in the discovery of MI77301 (SAR405838; Fig. 1A), a highly potent and selective
MDM2 inhibitor with much improved potency and efﬁcacy
over MI-219. We report herein our extensive preclinical characterization of SAR405838.

Materials and Methods
Chemical synthesis of SAR405838
SAR405838 was synthesized using a procedure similar to
that used for MI-888 (15) and its purity is >95% by highperformance liquid chromatography.
Biochemical binding assays
Binding afﬁnities of MDM2 inhibitors and p53 peptide
(residues 13–29) to MDM2 protein were determined using an

Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and b-catenin were determined using our published methods (16, 17), and its binding afﬁnity to MDMx was
determined using Biolayer Interferometry technology (18).
Determination of the cocrystal structure of
SAR405838/MDM2 complex
Cocrystals of human MDM2 (10-118) protein with
SAR405838 were obtained from the Qiagen Ammonium Sulfate
Screen condition B8 at 20 C. Diffraction data were collected at
the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory
and processed with HKL2000 (19). The cocrystal structure was
solved by molecular replacement in Phaser (20) using a structure of MDM2 developed in-house as the search model, ﬁt and
reﬁned using Coot (21), and further reﬁned using Buster (22).
Details are provided in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell lines, cell growth, cell cycle, cell death, and apoptosis
Unless otherwise stated, all cell lines were purchased
directly from ATCC. HCT-116 p53þ/þ and p53/ cell lines

were obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. Cell growth
inhibition activity was determined in a water-soluble tetrazolium–based assay (23). Cell-cycle analysis was performed
by ﬂow cytometric analysis of DNA content after propidium
iodide staining, with cell clumps, doublets, and subdiploid
cells excluded from the analysis. Cell death was measured by
Trypan blue staining and apoptosis was determined using an
Annexin V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Applied Science).
Real-Time PCR
cDNA was synthesized using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) with Oligo dt (Eurogentech). Next, TaqMan gene expression assays were performed by gene-speciﬁc primer/probe sets (Applied Biosystems) for real-time PCR ampliﬁcation in an Applied Biosystems 7900 thermocycler. RPL37a was used for normalization
using probes and primers from Applied Biosystems. Relative
quantiﬁcation of mRNA was calculated by a comparative cycle
threshold (Ct) method.

A Potent and Speciﬁc MDM2 Inhibitor in Clinical Development

Western blotting
For tumor cell lines, the following primary antibodies were
used: PUMAa/b (sc-374223) and MDM2 (SMP-14, sc-965) from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; p53 (DO-1, OP43) and MDM2 (OP46)
from Millipore; p21 (DCS60), caspase-3 (8G10), and PARP
(46D11) from the Cell Signaling Technology. For tumor tissues,
the following antibodies were used: p53 (OP43; Millipore),
MDM2 (sc-965; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p21 (556431; BD
Biosciences), PARP (9542; Cell Signaling Technology), caspase-3
(AAP-113; Stressgen Bioreagents), and horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated GAPDH (sc-5778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Immunohistochemical staining
For immunohistochemistry, the following antibodies were
used: p53 (OP43, EMD Millipore) and cleaved caspase-3 (9664;
Cell Signaling Technology). p53 was detected by VECTOR Red
Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Kit (AK-5100, Vector) and
cleaved caspase-3 was detected by diaminobenzidine (DAB)
tetrahydrochloride substrate using a DAB/buffer system
(Sigma).
RNA interference and shRNA knockdown
To downregulate PUMA, ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools for
human BBC3 (encoding PUMA) and nontargeting negative
control siRNAs (Dharmacon) were used. Transfection was
performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).
SJSA-1 cells were transfected with siRNAs for 2 days, followed
by drug treatment.
For stable p53 knockdown, a 19-bp shRNA interference,
corresponding to p53 nucleotides 611–629 (Genbank NM000546;
ref. 24) was used, with a scrambled shRNA construct as the
control (24). The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated
into a self-inactivating lentiviral vector under the control of the
H1 promoter (19) with the GFP reporter gene under control
of the human ubiquitin-C promoter. Lentiviral shRNA virus–
containing supernatant was used to infect the cells. At 96 hours
postinfection, the cells were sorted for GFP ﬂuorescence.
Meso Scale Discovery protein immunoassays
Total protein concentrations were determined with the BCA
protein assay kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and protein analysis was
performed by Meso Scale Discovery assays after appropriate
dilutions with the following kits: MDM2 (K152FID), p21
(N45ZA-1), p53, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP
(K15102D-1) with a Sector Imager 2400. Results were normalized with total protein concentration.
In vivo microPET and apoptosis imaging
MicroPET scans were done using the microPET FOCUS 120
PET scanner (Siemens Preclinical Solutions). 30 -Deoxy-30 -[(18)
F]ﬂuorothymidine(FLT)-positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging was performed on isoﬂurane-anesthetized mice starting 60 minutes after an i.v. injection of 6 to 8 mBq of FLT. Image
acquisition time was 12 minutes. Images were reconstructed
using a two-dimensional ordered subset-expectation maximization reconstruction algorithm (OSEM2D). Standardized
uptake value was calculated for each tumor with three
mice/tumors in each group.

www.aacrjournals.org

In vivo apoptosis induction was assessed by ﬂuorescence
molecular tomography imaging performed with FMT2500
(PerkinElmer). Annexin-Vivo-750 uptake scans were done on
Ketamine/Xylazine 120/6 mg/kg i.p. anesthetized mice starting at least 4 hours after probes i.v. injection. Images were
reconstructed and analyzed using TrueQuant software.
In vivo pharmacodynamic and efﬁcacy experiments
To develop xenograft tumors, 5  106 tumor cells with 50%
Matrigel were injected subcutaneously on the dorsal side of
SCID mice (LNCaP in males and other three models in
females).
For pharmacodynamic studies, when tumors reached a
mean of 200 mm3, three mice per group were treated with
vehicle control or a single dose of the drug via oral gavage and
sacriﬁced at each time point, with tumor tissue harvested for
analyses.
For in vivo efﬁcacy experiments, when tumors reached 100 to
200 mm3, mice were randomized into groups of eight mice, except
in the HCT-116 and single-dose SJSA-1 efﬁcacy experiments, in
which six mice per group were used. Vehicle control (10%
PEG400: 3% Cremophor: 87% PBS, or 2%TPGS:98%PEG200) or
SAR405838 was given orally once per day for the indicated dose
and duration. Tumor sizes and animal weights were measured
two to three times per week with tumor volume (mm3) ¼ (length
 width2)/2. Statistical analyses were done by two-way ANOVA
and unpaired two-tailed t test, using Prism (version 4.0, GraphPad). All animal experiments were performed under the guidelines of the University of Michigan Committee for Use and Care of
Animals or of the Sanoﬁ Committee for Use and Care of Animals.

Results
SAR405838 has a much improved binding afﬁnity to
MDM2 and chemical stability over MI-219 and good oral
pharmacokinetics in animals
SAR405838 has several major structural differences from
MI-219: a different stereochemistry in the quaternary carbon
atom, different halogen substitution patterns in both phenyl
rings, and a conformationally constrained cyclohexanol group
(Fig. 1A).
SAR405838 has Ki ¼ 0.88 nmol/L to human MDM2 protein in
a competitive binding assay (15) and is >10, >50, and >1,000
times more potent than MI-219, nutlin-3a, and the p53 peptide,
respectively (Fig. 1B). To assess its selectivity, we tested
SAR405838 for binding to MDMx, a homolog of MDM2. We
also tested SAR405838 for its binding to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 (25,
26), and b-catenin (17, 27), all of which contain a hydrophobic
binding groove on their surface. SAR405838 shows no appreciable binding to these proteins at concentrations as high as 10
mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1). SAR405838 has IC50 values in
the mmol/L range at best, for only a few of the >200 receptors/
enzymes tested (data not shown). SAR405838 was tested for its
stability in cell culture media and two other solutions in which
some spiro-oxindoles were shown to isomerize (15) and was
found to be stable (Supplementary Fig. S2). It has good oral
pharmacokinetics in mice, rats, and dogs (Supplementary
Table S3).

Figure 2. SAR405838 potently activates p53 in the SJSA-1 and HCT-116 cancer cell lines and strongly induces PUMA upregulation and cleavage of caspase-3
and PARP in the SJSA-1 cell line but not in the HCT-116 cell line. A and B, analysis of dose-dependent transcriptional induction of p21, MDM2, and PUMA in
both cell lines. C and D, analysis of dose-dependent induction of p53, p21, MDM2, and PUMA proteins and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in both cell lines.

Hence, SAR405838 is a potent and selective MDM2 inhibitor
with good chemical stability and excellent oral bioavailability.
Structural basis of the high afﬁnity binding of SAR405838
to MDM2
We determined the cocrystal structure of the SAR405838/
MDM2 complex at 2.1 Å resolution (Fi. 1C and Supplementary
Table S1). SAR405838 mimics the three key p53-binding residues (Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26; Fig. 1D; ref. 28) in its interaction
with MDM2, but captures additional interactions. The Cl atom
in the oxindole group of SAR405838 has extensive hydrophobic
contacts with MDM2. There is p-p stacking between the His96
of MDM2 and the 2-ﬂuoro-3-chlorophenyl in SAR405838 and a
hydrogen bond between the imidazole side chain of His96 and
the carboxyl group in SAR405838. Interestingly, the N-terminus
of MDM2 (residues 10–18) refolds and enjoys extensive interactions with SAR405838 through Val14 and Thr16, different
from those in the p53:MDM2 (28) and nutlin:MDM2 (7)
cocrystal structures.
To investigate the signiﬁcance of this refolding, we tested the
binding afﬁnities of SAR405838 to several shorter MDM2
proteins (Supplementary Table S2). Removal of the ﬁrst 9 Nterminal residues in MDM2 has no effect on binding to
SAR405838, but further truncation reduces the binding afﬁnity.
SAR405838 binds to MDM2 18-118 and 25-118 proteins with Ki
¼ 8.6 nmol/L and 24.0 nmol/L, respectively, being 10 and 25
times weaker than that with the MDM2 1-118 protein. The p53
peptide (13–29) binds to MDM2 25-118 protein with a higher
afﬁnity (Ki ¼ 283 nmol/L) than to MDM2 1-118 protein (Ki ¼ 1.3

mmol/L) and nutlin-3a binds to these two MDM2 constructs (1118 and 25-118) with similar afﬁnities. These data show that
residues 10–24 in MDM2 enhance the binding afﬁnity for
SAR405838 by a factor of 25, but have no effect for the binding
to p53 peptide or to nutlin-3a.
SAR405838 potently activates the p53 pathway
Mechanistically, by occupying the p53 pocket in MDM2 (Fig.
1C), an MDM2 inhibitor blocks p53–MDM2 interaction and
consequently the MDM2-mediated p53 protein degradation,
leading to p53 accumulation and transcriptional activation in
cells with wild-type p53 but not in cells with mutated or deleted
p53 (7, 8). Activation of p53 will transcribe its targeted genes,
such as MDM2 and p21, while having no effect on p53 transcription (7, 8). We analyzed SAR405838 for its activity and
speciﬁcity to activate p53, using MI-219 and/or nutlin-3a as
controls.
In the SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line with wild-type p53 and
MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation, SAR405838 induces dose-dependent upregulation of MDM2, p21, and PUMA mRNA with EC50
values of 0.3 to 0.6 mmol/L (Fig. 2A), but has no effect on p53
mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S3). In the HCT-116 colon cancer
cell line with wild-type p53 and no MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation,
SAR405838 also induces a robust, dose-dependent increase of
MDM2 and p21 mRNA, with EC50 values of 0.7 mmol/L (Fig. 2B),
but no increase of p53 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, SAR405838 only induces a modest increase (3-fold at 1
and 3 mmol/L) of PUMA mRNA in the HCT-116 cells, in
contrast to 19-fold induction at 1 mmol/L in the SJSA-1 cells

(Fig. 2A). In both cell lines, SAR405838 is 5 to 10 times more
potent than MI-219 and nutlin-3a in induction of p21 and
MDM2 transcription (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Western blotting showed that SAR405838 induces a dosedependent increase in the levels of p53, p21, and MDM2
proteins in both SJSA-1 and HCT-116 cell lines (Fig. 2C). While
SAR405838 induces clear increase of PUMA protein at 30 nmol/
L in the SJSA-1 cell line, it only has a modest effect on PUMA in
the HCT-116 cell line even at 10 mmol/L (Fig. 2C). SAR405838
also dose dependently increases the levels of p53, p21, MDM2,
and PUMA proteins in the RS4;11 acute leukemia and LNCaP
prostate cancer cell lines, with a clear effect at 100 nmol/L
(Supplementary Fig. S4). SAR405838 is >10 times more potent
than MI-219 in activation of p53 in these four cell lines (Fig. 2C–
D and SI Fig. S4).
We tested the speciﬁcity of SAR405838 in cancer cell lines
with mutated or deleted p53 (7, 8). SAR405838 has no effect on
p21, MDM2, PUMA, and p53 proteins in cancer cell lines
harboring mutated p53 or with p53 deletion (Supplementary
Fig. S5), indicating its high cellular speciﬁcity.
Taken together, our cellular data provide clear evidence that
SAR405838 is a potent and speciﬁc MDM2 inhibitor.
SAR405838 potently inhibits cell growth and induces
cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in cancer cell lines in
a p53-dependent manner
SAR405838 is 5 to 10 times more potent than MI-219 and
nutlin-3a in inhibition of cell growth in wild-type p53 cancer
cell lines of diverse tumor types (Table 1). SAR405838 has IC50
10 mmol/L against all cancer cell lines with a mutated or
deleted p53 (Table 1), showing high speciﬁcity.
Activation of p53 by nutlin-3a results in cell-cycle arrest in all
cancer cell lines investigated, but provokes apoptosis only in
some cancer cell lines (29). We evaluated by ﬂow cytometry, the
effect of SAR405838 on cell-cycle progression and apoptosis in
four cancer cell lines with wild-type p53 (Fig. 3A and B). In the
SJSA-1 cell line, SAR405838 induces both cell-cycle arrest and
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, but displays different
kinetics for these two cellular processes, with an early onset for
cell-cycle arrest and a late onset for apoptosis. In the RS4;11
acute leukemia cell line, SAR405838 induces time- and dosedependent apoptosis but not cell-cycle arrest. In the LNCaP

www.aacrjournals.org

prostate cancer and HCT-116 colon cancer cell lines,
SAR405838 effectively inhibits cell-cycle progression at 0.3
mmol/L or higher with 24-hour treatment, but has a modest
or minimal effect on apoptosis induction even at 10 mmol/L.
Using the HCT-116 p53þ/þ and the isogenic p53/ cell
lines, we showed that the cellular growth inhibitory activity of
SAR405838 is p53-dependent (Table 1). To determine whether
the cellular activity of SAR405838 is also strictly p53-dependent
in the SJSA-1, RS4;11, and LNCaP cell lines, we stably knocked
down p53 by shRNAi. Efﬁcient knockdown of p53 in SJSA-1
cells effectively attenuates upregulation of p53, p21, MDM2,
and PUMA, as well as cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 (Fig. 3C)
by SAR405838, reduces its potency in cell growth inhibition by
>20 times, and disables its ability to induce apoptosis (Fig. 3C)
and cell-cycle arrest (Supplementary Fig. S6). Knockdown of
p53 also effectively attenuates cell growth inhibition and
apoptosis induction by SAR405838 in the RS4;11 cell line
(Supplementary Fig. S7) and cell growth inhibition and cellcycle arrest in the LNCaP line by SAR405838 (Supplementary
Fig. S8). These data ﬁrmly establish that the cellular activity of
SAR405838 is p53-dependent.
PUMA mediates apoptosis induction by SAR405838 in
tumor cells
Although SAR405838 can robustly activate p53 in both the
SJSA-1 and HCT-116 cell lines, it selectively induces apoptosis in
the SJSA-1 cells. As SAR405838 effectively increases the mRNA
and protein levels of PUMA in SJSA-1 cells, but not in HCT-116
cells, we examined the role of PUMA, a strong proapoptotic
protein (30). While efﬁcient knockdown of PUMA by siRNA in
SJSA-1 cells has no effect on induction of p53, p21, and MDM2
proteins by SAR405838, it effectively reduces the cleavage of
caspase-3 and apoptosis by SAR405838 (Fig. 3D).
In addition to PUMA, p53 can also directly regulate the
expression of proapoptotic Bax and Noxa (31, 32), both of
which play a role in p53-mediated apoptosis (33). Real-time
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis,
however, showed that SAR405838, MI-219 and nutlin-3a have
no signiﬁcant effect on the mRNA levels of Bax and Noxa in the
SJSA-1 cell line (Supplementary Fig. S3). Hence, our data show
that PUMA plays a key role in apoptosis induction by
SAR405838 in SJSA-1 cells.

Figure 3. SAR405838 induces p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in SJSA-1 RS4;11, LNCaP, and HCT-116 cancer cell lines. A, analysis of
apoptosis induction in the four cell lines. B, analysis of cell-cycle progression in four cell lines. C, investigation of the role of p53 in apoptosis induction by
SAR405838. D, examination of the role of PUMA in apoptosis induction by SAR40583 in the SJSA-1 cell line.

SAR405838 strongly activates p53 in tumor tissues
To gain insights into the mechanism of action of SAR405838
in vivo, we performed pharmacodynamic analyses in the SJSA1, HCT-116, RS4;11, and LNCaP xenograft tumors in mice
treated with a single, oral dose of SAR405838.
In the SJSA-1 tumor tissue, qRT-PCR analysis showed that
SAR405838 induces dose-dependent and robust upregulation
for p21 and PUMA mRNA, but a relatively moderate increase
for MDM2 mRNA (Fig. 4A). Induction for p21 and PUMA mRNA
is already robust at 6 hours at all doses tested and the strong
effect persists longer with higher doses, increasing from 24
hours with 50 mg/kg to 72 hours with 200 mg/kg (Fig. 4A). On
the protein level, SAR405838 induces dose-dependent
increases of MDM2, p21, and p53 proteins at both 6-hour and
24-hour time points (Fig. 4B). However, unlike the kinetics
observed for transcriptional induction, the protein level for
each of MDM2, p21, and p53 peaks at 6 hours at all three doses
and is minimally elevated at 72 hours (Fig. 4B). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining conﬁrmed that the p53 protein is
strongly upregulated at 3 and 6 hours but greatly diminished at
24 hours in tumor tissue (Fig. 4C). Compared with upregulation
of p53, MDM2, and p21 proteins, cleavage of caspase-3 is a
delayed event, minimal at 6 hours, with all the three doses but
very robust at 24 hours (Fig. 4B). Western blotting showed that

5860

Cancer Res; 74(20) October 15, 2014

cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 was very clear at 24 hours in
the tumor tissue treated with a single dose of SAR405838 at 100
mg/kg (Supplementary Fig. S9). These in vivo pharmacodynamic data indicate that SAR405838 induces dose- and timedependent p53 activation and strong apoptosis in the SJSA1
tumor tissue.
In HCT-116 xenograft tumor tissue, SAR405838 induces doseand time-dependent transcription of p21, PUMA, and MDM2
genes (Supplementary Fig. S11A). However, the magnitude of
induction of p21 and MDM2 mRNA by SAR405838 is three to
four times lower than that observed in the SJSA-1 tumor tissue.
More strikingly, the maximum induction of PUMA mRNA by
SAR405838 is only 3-fold over the control even at 200 mg/kg, as
compared with the >40-fold increase in the SJSA-1 tumor tissue.
On the protein level, SAR405838 dose dependently increases
MDM2, p21, and p53 proteins in the HCT-116 tumor tissue with
kinetics similar to those in the SJSA-1 tumor (Supplementary
Fig. S10B). However, SAR405838 induces minimal caspase-3
cleavage in the HCT-116 tumor in all doses and at all time points.
In the RS4;11 xenograft tissue, SAR405838 induces dosedependent transcriptional upregulation of MDM2, p21, and
PUMA mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S11A), similar to that
observed in the SJSA-1 xenograft tissue. Strong apoptosis
induction was evident at 100 and 200 mg/kg and 6 and 24

hours based upon cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP (Supplementary Fig. S11B).
In the LNCaP xenograft tissue, SAR405838 induces dose- and
time-dependent transcriptional upregulation of MDM2, p21,
and PUMA (Supplementary Fig. S12A). The magnitude of the
transcriptional upregulation with p21 and MDM2 was similar
to that observed in the other three models. The induction of
PUMA mRNA by SAR405838 in the LNCaP tumor tissue is
weaker than in the SJSA-1 and RS4;11 tumor tissues, but
stronger than in the HCT-116 tumor tissue. On the protein
level, SAR405838 induces robust accumulation of MDM2, p21,
and p53 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S12B). While the level of p53 protein peaks at the 6hour time point, the strong upregulation of p21 and MDM2
proteins persists much longer. There is, however, a minimal

www.aacrjournals.org

amount of cleaved caspase-3 in the LNCaP tumor tissue
(Supplementary Fig.S11B), indicating a low level of apoptosis
induction.
Hence, in all the four models examined, a single, oral dose of
SAR405838 activates p53 in tumor tissues in a dose- and timedependent manner and is capable of inducing strong apoptosis
in the SJSA-1 and RS4;11 xenograft tumors, but only minimal or
modest apoptosis in the HCT-116 and LNCaP xenograft
tumors.
SAR405838 achieves complete and durable SJSA-1 tumor
regression
We tested the efﬁcacy of SAR405838 in the SJSA-1 xenograft
model, which has MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation and has been used
to evaluate other MDM2 inhibitors in vivo (7, 8, 34, 35).

tumor tissue. D, enhanced ﬂuorescent Annexin-V imaging uptake analysis of apoptosis in the SJSA-1 tumor tissue.

With daily, oral administration for 2 weeks, SAR405838 at 10
mg/kg has no signiﬁcant activity but at 30 mg/kg, it induces
partial tumor regression (Fig. 5A). At 100 mg/kg, it achieves
rapid, complete, and persistent tumor regression (Fig. 5A).
After only four doses, the average tumor volume shrinks by
>90% and after 9 doses, all tumors completely regress, becoming undetectable. The complete tumor regression is durable; 31
days after the last dose, at day 55, all eight mice remain tumor
free, and at day 73, 2 months after the last dose, 5 of 8 (63%) of
the animals are still tumor free.
As a single dose of SAR405838 induces strong apoptosis in
the SJSA-1 tumor tissue, we tested whether a single, oral dose of
SAR405838 can achieve strong antitumor activity (Fig. 5B).
Remarkably, a single 100 mg/kg oral treatment with
SAR405838 effectively inhibits tumor growth and a single oral
dose of 200 mg/kg induces complete tumor regression in 100%
of the mice.
To gain further insights into the complete tumor regression achieved with a single dose of SAR405838 in the SJSA-1
tumor model, we used the FLT-PET technique to image
tumor proliferation (Fig. 5C) and an Annexin-V 750 kit to

5862

Cancer Res; 74(20) October 15, 2014

image tumor apoptosis in mice. The imaging data showed
that a single dose of SAR405838 effectively inhibits tumor
cell proliferation and induces strong apoptosis, with the
effect persisting for 72 hours (Fig. 5D).
SAR405838 is highly efﬁcacious in xenograft models of
multiple tumor types lacking MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation
As MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation is only found in, on average,
5% to 7% of human tumors (6), we tested SAR405838
in RS4;11, LNCaP, and HCT-116 tumor models, which
have a wild-type p53 status but that all lack MDM2 gene
ampliﬁcation.
SAR405838 achieves partial tumor regression at 50 mg/kg
and complete tumor regression at 100 or 200 mg/kg daily
dosing in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia RS4;11 model
(Fig. 6A). The tumor regression achieved by SAR405838 at
200 mg/kg in the RS4;11 model is durable; at day 71, 25 days
after the last dose, all eight mice remained tumor free.
SAR405838 shows strong antitumor activity in the
LNCaP prostate cancer model (Fig. 6B). Administered daily
at 50 mg/kg for 4 weeks, it inhibits tumor growth by 70%

over the vehicle control, at 100 mg/kg it completely inhibits
tumor growth, and at 200 mg/kg, it induces 80% tumor
regression.
Although SAR405838 fails to achieve tumor regression in the
HCT-116 colon cancer model, it effectively inhibits tumor
growth (Fig. 6C). SAR405838 at 100 mg/kg daily dosing inhibits
tumor growth by >80% over the vehicle control at the end of the
treatment, and at 200 mg/kg, completely inhibits tumor
growth. Annexin-V in vivo imaging consistently showed that
SAR405838 does not induce detectable apoptosis in the HCT116 tumor tissue in mice (Fig. 6D).
SAR405838 is well tolerated in these efﬁcacy experiments,
producing less than 10% weight loss in all dose-scheduled tests
(Supplementary Fig. S13), and causing no signs of toxicity in
mice.

Discussion
Our extensive optimization of MI-219 has yielded
SAR405838, which is >10 times more potent than MI-219 in
binding to MDM2 and in activation of p53 in tumor cells with
wild-type p53. Importantly, SAR405838 has good chemical
stability in solution, thus overcoming a signiﬁcant issue associated with our earlier MDM2 inhibitors (36). SAR405838 has
good oral pharmacokinetics in rodents and nonrodents and
achieves much stronger and more sustained p53 activation
than MI-219 in tumor tissues with oral administration. This

www.aacrjournals.org

translates into an impressive antitumor activity for SAR405838,
including complete and persistent tumor regression with oral,
daily administration in the SJSA-1 tumor model. Remarkably, a
single, oral dose of SAR405838 at 200 mg/kg is capable of
achieving complete SJSA-1 tumor regression in 100% of mice.
Although genetic studies have shown that tissue-speciﬁc p53
activation by the deletion of the MDM2 gene results in complete regression of established tumors (37–39), previously
reported MDM2 inhibitors, including MI-219, nutlin-3a, and
recently reported more potent MDM2 inhibitors, such as AM8533 (34) and RG-7112 (35), all fail to achieve complete tumor
regression in the SJSA-1 tumor model. Consistently, in vivo
imaging showed that a single dose of SAR405838 induces
sustained apoptosis persisting for 3 days in SJSA-1 tumors.
Although only 5% of human cancers have an ampliﬁed
MDM2 gene (6), a higher frequency of MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation occurs in certain tumor types, including soft tissue tumors
(20%), osteosarcomas (16%), and esophageal carcinomas
(13%), and well-differentiated liposarcomas (>80%; refs. 40,
41). The complete tumor regression achieved by SAR405838 in
the SJSA-1 xenograft model suggests its strong therapeutic
potential as a single agent for the treatment of human tumors
with MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation.
SAR405838 also shows strong antitumor activity in xenograft models of different tumor types that possess wild-type
p53 but lack MDM2 gene ampliﬁcation. SAR405838 achieves

complete tumor regression in the RS4;11 acute leukemia
model, partial (80%) tumor regression in the LNCaP prostate
cancer model, and complete tumor growth inhibition in the
HCT-116 colon cancer model. The tumor regression correlates with the ability of SAR405838 to induce strong apoptosis in tumors. Our data suggest that SAR405838 may also
have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of human
cancers containing a wild-type p53 but lacking MDM2 gene
ampliﬁcation.
While SAR405838 induces strong upregulation of p21 and
MDM2 in all tested cancer cell lines with wild-type p53, it has a
different effect on PUMA in vitro and in vivo. SAR405838
induces robust upregulation of PUMA in SJSA-1 and RS4;11
tumor cells, but has a modest effect in LNCaP and HCT-116
tumor cells. Furthermore, strong upregulation of PUMA by
SAR405838 correlates with apoptosis induction in vitro and in
vivo and complete tumor regression in vivo, suggesting the
critical role of PUMA in mediating apoptosis and tumor
regression. Indeed, knockdown of PUMA by siRNA in SJSA-1
cells effectively reduces activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis
induction by SAR405838, without affecting induction of p53,
MDM2, and p21 proteins. Although Noxa and Bax are also p53targeted genes, they are not induced by SAR405838 in SJSA-1
cells. These data suggest that PUMA is a key mediator for
apoptosis induction by MDM2 inhibitors in tumor cells and
that strong upregulation of PUMA induced by SAR405838
results in complete tumor regression in vivo.
The SAR405838:MDM2 cocrystal structure provides insights
into the high afﬁnity binding. In addition to capturing all the
key hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts between the
three p53 key binding residues with MDM2 (28), SAR405838
enjoys several additional interactions with MDM2 that are not
observed in the p53:MDM2 (28) or nutlin:MDM2 cocrystal
structures (9). In particular, SAR405838 induces refolding
of the unstructured extreme N-terminus of MDM2 (residues
10–25), which further enhances their interactions and
enhances the binding afﬁnity by 25-fold but makes no significant contribution to the binding of nutlin-3a and the p53
peptide to MDM2.

In summary, our present study demonstrates that
SAR405838 is a potent and highly efﬁcacious MDM2 inhibitor.
On the basis of these promising preclinical data, SAR405838
was selected for clinical development and is currently being
evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancer.
