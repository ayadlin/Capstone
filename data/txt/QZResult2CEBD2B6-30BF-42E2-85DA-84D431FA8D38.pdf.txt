ABSTRACT
Dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) contributes to several aspects
of oncogenesis including drug resistance. In melanoma, distinct RTKs have been
involved in BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) resistance, yet the utility of RTKs expression
pattern to identify intrinsically resistant tumors has not been assessed. Transcriptional
profiling of RTKs and integration with a previous classification, reveals three robust
subtypes in two independent datasets of melanoma cell lines and one cohort of
melanoma samples. This classification was validated by Western blot in a panel of
patient-derived melanoma cell lines. One of the subtypes identified here for the first
time displayed the highest and lowest expression of EGFR and ERBB3, respectively,
and included BRAF-mutant tumors all intrinsically resistant to BRAFi PLX4720, as
assessed by analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia pharmacogenomic study and
by in vitro growth inhibition assays. High levels of EGFR were detected, even before
therapy, in tumor cells of one of three melanoma patients unresponsive to BRAFi.
Use of different pharmacological inhibitors highlighted the relevance of PI3K/mTOR
signaling for growth of this PLX4720-resistant subtype. Our results identify a specific
molecular profile of melanomas intrinsically resistant to BRAFi and suggest the PI3K/
mTOR pathway as a potential therapeutic target for these tumors.

survival, compared to chemotherapy, in randomized phase
III trials [4, 5]. Despite these remarkable clinical results,
acquired resistance invariably develops in most patients,
including those showing an initial strong regression of
tumor burden [4, 6]. Furthermore, approximately 1 in
5 patients with BRAF mutant melanoma shows progression
at first assessment during treatment, due to intrinsic/
primary resistance in their tumors [6, 7] indicating that
the mutational status of the target oncogene is insufficient

INTRODUCTION
The discovery of the BRAFV600E substitution as the
most common genetic event in melanoma [1] rapidly led
to the clinical development of selective ATP-competitive
RAF kinase inhibitors (i.e. Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib)
targeting the mutant BRAF protein [2, 3]. These two drugs
gained FDA approval, based on evidence for significant
improvement in response rates and in progression free

to predict responsiveness to therapy. The identification
of molecular features associated with primary resistance
to mutant BRAF targeting will enable identification of
melanoma patients likely to fail treatment. To this end,
gene expression profiling provides powerful means of
classifying tumors based on their underlying biology
[8–11]. In melanoma, two divergent major subtypes,
consistently identified by several authors [12–16], could be
classified according to the “Melanoma Phenotype-Specific
Expression” (MPSE) signature [17]. This signature
includes the melanocyte master regulator microphthalmiaassociated transcription factor (MITF) and many of its
known targets [18]. Low expression of MITF and MITFregulated genes and high expression of genes involved
in motility and invasiveness, including AXL, defines the
subtype named invasive, while the proliferative one is
defined by opposite expression of these genes [17]. Indeed,
we have previously shown that AXL is highly expressed, at
the protein level, in human melanoma cell lines and clinical
samples which lacks expression of MITF and of MITFtargets [19]. The antagonistic MITF/AXL transcriptional
profile was recently linked to intrinsic resistance to RAF
and MAPK pathway inhibitors [20]. Thus, higher levels of
MITF and correlated genes were found in BRAF mutant
tumors sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) PLX4720
and to the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) AZD6244, whereas
resistant lines were associated to high NF-κB activity and
expression of AXL and correlated genes [20].
Subtype-specific expression of key signaling proteins
like AXL and other RTKs is also central to the signaling
pathways inherently available to a given melanoma celltype. Several studies proposed elevated signaling of single
RTKs as a mechanism of BRAFi resistance [21–28]. So
far, however, the potential role of RTK profiling as a
classification tool to discriminate BRAFi-resistant and
-susceptible tumors has not been evaluated.
In this study we assessed whether the expression
pattern of RTK genes could stratify melanomas in different
groups. By integrating the RTK classification with the
previously identified MPSE phenotypes [17], we derived
a robust classification of melanoma tumors in three
subtypes that was validated in both cell lines and clinical
samples. This classification led to the identification of a
new melanoma subtype displaying intrinsic resistance
to targeted therapy against mutant BRAF. Moreover,
we provide evidence of PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway
dependency of such intrinsically resistant cells.

class discovery approach (Figure 1A) to gene expression
data of 58 melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Table 1)
included in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)
[29]. We selected 177 probe sets representing 57 unique
RTKs. Based on the gene expression barcode, 64 probe
sets, mapping on 34 unique RTKs and expressed in at
least 5% of samples, were used to perform hierarchical
clustering (HC) (Figure 1B). We found two major clusters
composed of 12 and 46 samples and characterized by
distinct expression patterns of RTK genes. In particular,
the two clusters were marked by mutually exclusive
expression of ERBB3 and EGFR (Figure 1B), thus
they were named EGFRHIGH/ERBB3LOW and EGFRLOW/
ERBB3HIGH. Additionally, consensus hierarchical
clustering (CHC) was applied and we observed that HC
and CHC were highly concordant in assigning samples to
the two subtypes, indicating a good robustness of these
classes (Supplementary Figure 1A). Finally, according to
silhouette analysis, 56 samples had a positive silhouette
score and were representative of their cluster assignment
(Supplementary Figure  1B), while two  samples
with a negative silhouette score were classified as
“undetermined”.
We next asked how our newly identified RTK
subtypes compared with the invasive and proliferative
phenotypes. For this purpose we used the MPSE signature
[17] to predict the phenotype of the 58 melanoma
cell lines included in CCLE. This prediction assigned
22 samples to the invasive phenotype and 25 to the
proliferative one; the remaining 11 cell lines could not be
assigned to any phenotype (Supplementary Figure 1C).
A clear and robust distinction in two groups of the 47
classified cell lines was confirmed by HC and CHC using
the MPSE signature (Figure  1C and Supplementary
Figure 1D). Silhouette analysis proved that all samples
were correctly classified (Supplementary Figure  1E).
Comparing the RTK and MPSE classifications we found
that all EGFRHIGH/ERBB3LOW samples were included in the
invasive phenotype while EGFRLOW/ERBB3HIGH samples
were invasive or proliferative (Figure 1C). Therefore,
we combined RTK and MPSE subtypes leading to the
following classification in three main subtypes: EGFRHIGH/
ERBB3LOW-Invasive; EGFRLOW/ERBB3HIGH-Invasive;
EGFRLOW/ERBB3HIGH-Proliferative. Samples with an
undetermined classification by RTK or MPSE were not
assigned to any of the three subtypes and were excluded
from subsequent analyses.
This new classification was obtained by sequential
stratification of samples using two distinct gene lists.
To retrieve an integrated gene signature, able to directly
discriminate the three subtypes, we applied the ClaNC
algorithm and we identified a 210-gene signature (named
hereafter RTK/MPSE) (Supplementary Table 2) as the
minimal set of genes with lowest classification error rate
(error rate in five-fold cross-validation = 0%). Among
RTK genes, both EGFR and ERBB3 were included in this

other genes involved in melanocyte development and
pigmentation signaling (gene-cluster 1). EGFRHIGH/
ERBB3LOW-Invasive melanomas could be distinguished
from EGFRLOW/ERBB3HIGH-Invasive by down-regulation
of genes involved in antigen presentation pathways and
coding for HLA class II antigens and their transcriptional
regulators (gene-cluster 2) and for higher expression of
genes associated to regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal

signature. The ability of the new RTK/MPSE signature
to discriminate the three subtypes was assessed by HC
(Figure 1D) and the accuracy of such classification was
confirmed. These 210 genes clustered in three major
groups of highly correlated genes (Figure 1D and
Supplementary Table 2). We performed functional analysis
of these gene-clusters to identify biological pathways
distinguishing our melanoma subtypes (summarized in

transition, cellular movement, constituent of extracellular
matrix and growth factors (gene-cluster 3). These
later genes were down-regulated in the EGFRLOW/
ERBB3HIGH-Proliferative subtype. These results indicate
that expression of genes involved in relevant biological
pathways such as melanoma development, differentiation,
immunity and metastatic behavior allows dissection
of melanoma heterogeneity in three clearly separated
subtypes. Furthermore, this classification led to the
discovery of the EGFRHIGH/ERBB3LOW-Invasive subtype,
previously hidden in the broader phenotypic class of
invasive tumors.

to correct for inter-study batch effects (Supplementary
Figures 2A–2B). The process of subtype validation is
summarized in Figure 2A. By HC and CHC using the
RTK/MPSE signature, Meta-Cell dataset was divided
in three robust clusters (Figure  2B and Supplementary
Figure 3A). A positive silhouette width was observed
for 95% of samples (Supplementary Figure  3B). The
genes contained in the RTK/MPSE signature conserved
their correlation patterns as 197/210 genes fell into the
previously defined gene-clusters, indicating a similarity
between melanoma subtypes defined in CCLE and MetaCell datasets (Figure 2B). SubMap analysis confirmed a
univocal correspondence between subtypes identified in
the two independent datasets (Figure 2C).
The same approach was applied to gene expression
data of 371 metastatic melanoma tissue samples
collected from 8 public datasets (Meta-Clinical dataset,
Supplementary Table 1). ComBat adjustment efficiently
removed the inter-study technical variation that was
inflated by the merging of datasets profiled with different

To assess the reproducibility of the three melanoma
subtypes identified in CCLE, we collected gene expression
data for 187 melanoma cell lines from five different
studies (Supplementary Table 1) and integrated them in a

platforms (Supplementary Figures 2C–2D). Despite only
154 out of 210 genes of the RTK/MPSE signature were
available in Meta-Clinical dataset, HC and CHC revealed
a robust separation of patients in three robust clusters
(Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure 3C). The majority
(97%) of samples were correctly assigned to their cluster
membership as they had a positive silhouette width
(Supplementary Figure  3D). SubMap analysis revealed
that the clinical subtypes were identical to those identified
in CCLE (Figure 2E).
Overall our RTK/MPSE signature enables the
identification of distinct biological melanoma subtypes in
a robust and reproducible manner, not only in cell lines but
also in metastatic melanoma clinical samples.

Western blot analysis of additional RTKs showed that
ERBB2, DDR1, DDR2 and IGF1R were expressed by
the majority, but not all cell lines and that MET and KIT
displayed a more restricted distribution (Supplementary
Figure 4) highlighting further level of complexity within
each subtype.

Drug resistance of melanoma cell lines according
to subtypes
To determine whether our classification could allow
prediction of melanoma response to drugs, we evaluated
by ANOVA how melanoma subtypes correlated with drugsensitivity data (IC50) in CCLE (Supplementary Table 5).
When all melanoma cell lines (n = 28) were considered, the
three subtypes showed a significantly different response
(FDR < 0.05) to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (Figure 4A),
to the SRC family kinase (SFK)/ABL dual-kinase
inhibitor AZD0530 and to the ALK inhibitor TAE684
(Supplementary Table 5). Considering BRAF-mutant
tumors only (V600E or V600D, n = 19), subtype-specific
response was still observed for AZD6244 (FDR = 0.030)
(Figure  4A) and, in addition, for PD-035901 (FDR =
0.030), a second MEK inhibitor (Supplementary Table 5).
The most striking drug-response difference was however
observed for PLX4720 (FDR = 0.001) with EGFRHIGH/
ERBB3LOW-Invasive being the most resistant (Figure 4A).
Pearson’s correlation between gene expression CCLE
data and IC50 of PLX4720 across BRAF-mutated
melanomas confirmed that all seven RTK genes were
directly (EGFR, AXL, EPHA2, PDGFRA and PDGFRB; r
between 0.6 and 0.8) or inversely correlated (MERTK and
ERBB3; r between –0.4 and –0.6) to PLX4720 resistance.
EGFR was the first RTK and the seventh most positively
correlated gene (r = 0.845; p-value = 5.34e-06). This
differential sensitivity to PLX4720 treatment was validated
in vitro in our panel of patient-derived melanoma cell lines
after treatment with increasing concentrations of PLX4720
(Figure 4B). As in CCLE, EGFRHIGH/ERBB3LOW-Invasive
cells were all highly resistant to PLX4720 (IC50 > 10 μM,
taken as the maximum value), EGFRLOW/ERBB3HIGHProliferative were sensitive or moderately resistant. The
AXL-positive EGFRLOW/ERBB3HIGH-Invasive subtype
showed the same heterogeneous sensitivity observed in
CCLE, with one cell line being highly resistant and the
others sensitive or moderately resistant.
The clinical significance of EGFR expression was
examined in ten surgical specimens of five patients with
BRAF-mutant melanomas treated at our Institute with
the BRAFi Vemurafenib (Supplementary Table 6). The
pre-therapy lesion of patient P3, one of the three patients
intrinsically resistant to therapy and rapidly progressing
under treatment, already displayed strong EGFR staining.
A clear increase in intensity was also found in two

RTK expression patterns in melanoma subtypes
Differential expression analysis was carried out
using ANOVA to identify, between the 34 RTKs, those
with subtype-specific gene expression patterns in both
CCLE and Meta-Cell datasets (Supplementary Table 3).
We found 30 RTKs differentially expressed at a false
discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 in at least one of the two cell
line datasets. However, to focus on the most relevant ones
we selected seven genes (AXL, EGFR, EPHA2, ERBB3,
MERTK, PDGFRA and PDGFRB) with an FDR < 0.0001
and a fold-change ≥ 2.5 in at least one of the contrasts,
in both datasets. Their expression levels according to
subtypes are shown in Figure 3A for CCLE. The same
analysis was repeated for the Meta-Clinical dataset
and the differential expression of 6 of the 7 RTKs was
validated (FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Table 3), except
for EPHA2, which however showed a trend of differential
expression (FDR = 0.052). The fold-changes between
contrasts observed in Meta-Clinical dataset were lower
compared to cell lines but gene expression data of clinical
samples could be affected by a higher noise, due to intratumor heterogeneity and merging of multiple microarray
platforms.
We then examined the protein expression of these
seven RTKs and MITF in a panel of 22 patient-derived
melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Table 4) by Western
blot analysis (Figure 3B). With a few exceptions, the
protein expression patterns in these cell lines reflected the
observations made at the gene level in the three subtypes:
EGFR and ERBB3 had a mutually exclusive expression
and all samples with high expression of EGFR and
absent/low of ERBB3 were a subset of the AXL-positive/
MITF-negative (Invasive) ones. The band intensities
for each protein were transformed to a numerical score
corresponding to absent (0), low (1) and intermediate-high
(2) expression levels. According to HC of these Western
blot scores, samples were clustered in three distinct groups,
whose RTK expression pattern resembled EGFRHIGH/
ERBB3LOW-Invasive, EGFRLOW/ERBB3HIGH-Invasive and

None of these specimens expressed MITF, whereas one of
the two progressing lesion co-expressed AXL (Figure 4C).
Pre- or post-therapy melanoma samples from the other
two unresponsive patients (P2 and P5) and from the
two responsive ones (P1 and P4), instead, did not have
detectable staining of EGFR or AXL. All together these
data indicates that mRNA and protein abundance of a core
group of RTK are distinguishing traits for the classification
of melanoma subtypes. Furthermore the RTK/MPSE
signature allows identification of BRAF tumors

expression of EGFR, negligible expression of ERBB3 and
expressed AXL at different levels. Although grouped in
the same cluster, Me27 was unique since it co-expressed
EGFR, AXL and ERBB3. Western blot analysis indicated
presence of basally phosphorylated (p) EGFR, AXL
and EPHA2 in all three cell lines (Figure 5A), whereas
pPDGFRB was detectable in Me36 and pERBB3 in

Me23. Me27 displayed a faint band in correspondence of

resistant to PLX4720 (Figure 5B).

(all at 100 ng/ml) and GAS6 500 ng/ml. All RTKs were basally phosphorylated, although at different level, in Me27; all, except PDGFR, in

Canertinib, of EGFR and HER2 by Lapatinib and of
PDGFR by Crenolanib could be effective only at high
dose (Figures 5E–5G). None of these drugs, with the
exception of Caneternib and Crenolanib on Me23,
showed a synergistic effect with PLX4720 (data not
shown). Two out of the three melanoma lines (Me27
and Me36) were instead sensitive, at low μM dose, to
Dasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor [30] (Figure  5H). In
addition, the PLX4720/Dasatinib combination was able
to reduce growth of Me23 and to further enhance cell
growth inhibition of Me27, in comparison to both drugs
alone (Figure 6A) and the effect was strongly synergistic
(Figure 6B). To identify the signaling pathway/s inhibited
by the combination of PLX4720 and Dasatinib we
examined, by Western blot, the activation of components
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, ERK/MAPK and SRC/FAK/
Paxillin, following single or combined drug treatments
(Figure  6C). Overall, we observed that the PLX4720/
Dasatinib combination was more effective in abrogating
or reducing, in Me23 and Me27, levels of phosphorylated
(p) ribosomal protein S6, a marker of mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) activity [31], at both
pS6S235–236 and pS6S240–242 sites. The effect of the drug
combination in comparison to single drugs was instead
similar for Me36 that displayed similarly sensitivity
to Dasatinib and PLX4720/Dasatinib combination
(Figure  6C). The effect of Dasatinib alone on pS6 was
also associated to the degree of Dasatinib sensitivity
(Figure  6C). All together, these findings suggested a
convergence of the combined treatment on suppression

single drugs when growth inhibitory effect was synergistic (Me23 and Me27). Controls are vehicle (DMSO) treated cells.

AZD8055 potently inhibited the in vitro growth of all three
melanoma cell lines (Figure 7A and 7B), whereas GDC0941 was less potent (Figure  7C). Inhibition of RAF/
MAPK/ERK pathway by PLX4720 exerted no further
effect on cell growth of two out of three cell lines. Only
on Me23, the combination of PLX4720 with GDC-0941,
or AZD8055 achieved synergistic growth inhibitory effect
indicating that, for this particular melanoma, concurrent
suppression of RAF/MAPK/ERK pathway is necessary
to affect growth when only PI3K or mTOR signaling
is abrogated. Taken together, these results indicate that
blockade of upstream RTKs can achieve only modest
growth inhibitory activity in PLX4720-resistant cells of
the EGFRHIGH/ERBB3LOW-Invasive subtype, whereas their

of TORC1 activity. As expected, Dasatinib completely
abrogated pSRC and downstream targets, pPaxillin and
pFAK in all three cell lines and reduced pAKT levels in
Me27 and Me36. PLX4720 reduced pERK in Me23 and
Me27. The PLX4720/Dasatinib combination was unable to
modulate these molecules any further, indicating that they
were not a necessary requirement to allow a synergistic
growth inhibitory effect to occur.
To prove that PI3K/mTOR signaling inhibition
could be relevant for these intrinsically resistant cells,
we used BEZ235, a selective inhibitor of the class I
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) enzymes and mTORC1
and 2, GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor (PI3Kα/δ), and
AZD8055, an inhibitor of mTORC1 and 2. BEZ235 and

are effectively targeted, even without simultaneous
inhibition of RAF/MAPK/ERK pathway.

previously described divergent phenotypes [12–17],
displaying high levels of AXL, were recently shown to
exhibit intrinsic resistance to MAPK-pathway inhibitors
[20]. However, as shown in CCLE dataset and by drug
sensitivity assays on melanoma cell lines, melanomas with
high expression of AXL include both resistant and sensitive
tumors. Instead, our newly defined EGFRHIGH/ERBB3LOWInvasive subtype is composed only of resistant tumors.
EGFR has been involved in adaptive and acquired
resistance of melanoma to BRAFi. In one study, 6 posttreatment biopsies from 16 patients who developed
resistance to BRAFi or MEKi expressed EGFR [28]; in
another, EGFR was hyperphosphorylated in 4 post-therapy
lesions from 5 relapsed patients [23]. The first study
hypothesized that increased EGFR could be the result
of an adaptive response of melanoma cells occurring in
presence of the drug and due to the activation of TGFβ
signaling following loss of the transcription factor
SOX10 [28]. Knockdown of SOX10 led to increased

DISCUSSION
In this study, we explored whether expression
levels and types of RTKs, frequently identified as targets
of negative feedback loop release and involved in drug
resistance mechanisms [21–28, 32–34], could identify
subtypes differing in terms of sensitivity to BRAFi.
Hierarchical clustering was therefore used to examine
RTK gene expression similarities among a high number
of samples (245 melanoma cell lines and 371 clinical
samples). Taking into account the previously described
MPSE phenotypes [17], we identified three stable
melanoma subtypes. Our classification significantly
improves detection of intrinsically resistant melanoma
cells. Indeed, melanomas belonging to one of the two

EGFR expression and to a concomitant decrease of MITF
[28]. We here describe that these features, expression of
EGFR, lack of MITF and SOX10, are inherent and occurs
independently of drug selection in EGFRHIGH/ERBB3LOWInvasive melanomas. Both MITF and SOX10 are included
in the RTK/MPSE signature (cluster 1) and are downregulated in this subtype. Our in vivo evidence of EGFR
expression in both pre-therapy and post-therapy lesions of
one out of three unresponsive patients, highlight the need
to assess expression of EGFR and other RTKs in pre-and
post-therapy lesions of a larger cohort of BRAF-mutant
patients with different response to BRAFi treatment. These
studies will inform on the value of EGFR and other RTKs
as biomarkers to identify BRAFi intrinsically resistant
tumors and will allow evaluation of their frequency at all
stages of resistance from intrinsic to adaptive and acquired.
In some instances but not in others, mechanisms
of resistance involving RTKs can be counteracted by
inhibition of RTKs often cooperating with PLX4720 to
inhibit growth of resistant cells in vitro and in vivo [20,
23, 27, 28]. In our three melanoma cell lines representing
the PLX4720-resistant EGFRHIGH/ERBB3LOW-Invasive
subtype, inhibition of single RTKs had limited efficacy
alone or in combination with PLX4720. Among the drugs
tested, only Dasatinib was effective and combination of
PLX4720 with Dasatinib resulted in a synergistic shifting
of the dose response even in Me23, which was resistant
to both single drugs. Dasatinib has a wide kinase profile
and targets PDGFRB, EPHA2, KIT, DDR1 and DDR2,
in addition to SRC family kinases and BCR–ABL [30].
Inhibition of these RTKs may be particularly relevant to
counteract the release of negative feedback loops with
the consequent activation of various signaling proteins
[32–34]. The synergy between PLX4720 and Dasatinib
converged on suppression of pS6, a marker mTORC1
activity. Combined inhibition of PI3K and MTORC1/2, an
attractive pathway target in melanoma [35], by BEZ235,
even without the addition of PLX4720, achieved strong in
vitro inhibition in these intrinsically resistant cells.
In conclusion, our results describe molecular
features allowing identification of a melanoma subtype
intrinsically resistant to BRAFi. Further characterization
of this subtype may allow definition of a set of biomarkers
that, together with RTKs, will aid the prediction of
intrinsic resistance. In addition, this study highlights the
need to understand signaling networks that, in addition to
the one here identified, could guide the choice of effective
treatments for this subtype of unresponsive patients.

lines were obtained from the CCLE database (http://www.

was retrieved from CCLE_hybrid_capture1650_hg19_

maf file; drug sensitivity data were extracted from CCLE_
NP24.2009_Drug_data_2012.02.20.csv file.
The Meta-Cell dataset was composed of five studies
[13, 36–39] profiled with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array,
for a total of 188 melanoma cell lines. The Meta-Clinical
dataset was composed of eight studies [40–45] for a total
of 378 metastatic melanoma samples profiled with five
different platforms. Raw data were downloaded from
NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database [46] (GEO,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

Gene expression data processing
For Affymetrix datasets, raw data were preprocessed using frozen RMA [47] as implemented in
the frma package of Bioconductor [48]. To distinguish
expressed and silenced probe sets we applied the barcode
[49] function of frma package. For Illumina datasets,
raw data were log2 transformed and normalized using
the robust spline normalization method implemented in
the lumi package [50]. Quality Control was applied to
each dataset independently on raw and normalized data.
Independent datasets composing the Meta-Cell and MetaClinical datasets were normalized separately and merged
using ComBat [51]. For identification of the RTK/MPSE
signature and for statistical analysis all datasets were
collapsed at the gene level selecting the probe with highest
variability according to inter-quartile range.

Identification of melanoma subtypes and
subtypes-specific gene signature
Identification of sample clusters according to RTKs
expression profiles was achieved using agglomerative
hierarchical clustering with average linkage and
1-Pearson’s correlation coefficient as distance measure.
Cluster stability was determined by consensus hierarchical
clustering [52], with average linkage, 1-Pearson’s
correlation as distance and a sub-sampling ratio of
features of 0.8 for 1000 iterations. Silhouette width [53]
was calculated to identify representative samples for
each class. Phenotype prediction essentially followed the
described classification method [17] except for Pearson’s
correlation coefficient (r) cut-off:
Invasive: rinv ≥ 0.4 and |rinv – rprol| ≥ 0.4
Proliferative: rprol ≥ 0.4 and |rinv – rprol| ≥ 0.4
Undetermined: rprol < 0.4 and rinv < 0.4 or
|rinv – rprol| ≥ 0.4
ClaNC algorithm [54] was used to select
discriminating genes among melanoma subtypes. The
number of genes tested for each class varied from 1 to
200 and the optimal gene signature was selected as that

Cell lines

Untreated or treated melanoma cells were processed
as described [19] using the primary antibodies listed in
Supplementary Table 7.

Western blotting

The study was conducted according to Declaration of
Helsinki Principles and following Institutional guidelines. All
primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines were established
in vitro from surgical specimens of cutaneous malignant
melanomas; their origin, mutational status and membership
to molecular subtypes identified in this study, are listed in
Supplementary Table 4. Molecular and biological features of
these cell lines and methods for identification of mutations
in BRAF, NRAS, PTEN and p53 genes and for cell
maintenance have been previously reported [19, 57]. Identity
of the cell lines was verified by short tandem repeat profiling
from early passage cells which are maintained as frozen
stocks and used for the experiments. All lines were tested
for the absence of Mycoplasma contamination by Hoechst
33258 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA).

Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of
melanoma samples were sectioned at 1 μm slide.
Immunohistochemical detection was performed
as described [19, 58] using antibodies listed in
Supplementary Table 7. Slides were scored for staining
by a dermatopathologist blinded to clinical outcome and
were imaged with a digital camera (AxioCamMrC5, Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) using an Axiovert 100 microscope
(Zeiss) and a 20x objective.

Statistical analysis and drug synergy testing
Differences in expression level of RTKs and
differences in IC50 values of PLX4720 among subtypes
were assessed by ANOVA p-values adjusted for multiple
testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery
rate. Tukey’s post-hoc analysis was performed only when
the overall adjusted p-values was < 0.05. Association
between categorical variables was carried out using
Fisher’s exact test. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Correlation between variables was calculated using
Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Analyses were conducted
in R environment version 3.0.2. For pharmacological
growth inhibition assays: generation of fitted lines using
the four-parameter nonlinear regression with a sigmoidal
dose-response (variable slope) and calculation of IC50
values of dose-response curves were done using Prism v
5.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA);
the combination index (CI) between pharmacological
inhibitors was established by the Chou and Talalay method
[59] using CompuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
CI < 1 was considered synergism.

Inhibitors
PLX4720, AZD8055, GDC0941, BEZ235, Canertinib,
Erlotinib (Tarceva), Gefitinib (Iressa), Crenolanib, Lapatinib
(Tykerb) and Dasatinib (Sprycel) (all from Selleck
Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) were diluted in DMSO at
10 mM/ml and stored at −20°C until use; when added to
cell cultures, the final DMSO concentration was 0.25–0.5%.

Pharmacological growth inhibition assays
Cultured melanoma cells were seeded into 48-well
plates. Twenty-four hours after seeding, serial dilutions
of individual drugs, drug combinations and/or vehicle
(DMSO), as indicated in the text, were added to achieve
the desired final concentrations. The doses were 0.004,
0.016, 0.063, 0.25, 1, 4 μM for AZD8055; 0.004, 0.016,
0.063, 0.25, 1, 4, 16 μM for PLX4720 and Dasatinib;
0.063, 0.25, 1, 4, 8, 16 μM for Erlotinib and Gefitinib;
0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 μM for GDC0941, Crenolanib and
Lapatinib; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 μM for Canertinib; 0.0016,
0.008, 0.04, 0.02, 1, 5 μM for BEZ235. For growth
inhibition, cells were incubated for 72 h and cell viability
determined using alamarBlue assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA) as previously described [19]. For Western blot,
cells were processed after 24 hr incubation.
