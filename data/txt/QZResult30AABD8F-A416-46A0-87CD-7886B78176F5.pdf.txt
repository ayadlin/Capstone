ABSTRACT
Few population-based analyses have investigated survival change in glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) patients treated with concomitant radiotherapy-temozolomide (RTTMZ) and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) and then bevacizumab (BEV) after Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval, respectively. We aimed to explore the effects
on survival with RT-TMZ, adjuvant TMZ and BEV in general GBM population based on
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Texas Cancer Registry
(TCR) databases. A total of 28933 GBM patients from SEER (N = 24578) and TCR
(N = 4355) between January 2000 and December 2013 were included. Patients were
grouped into three calendar periods based on date of diagnosis: pre-RT-TMZ and
pre-BEV (1/2000–2/2005, P1), post-RT-TMZ and pre-BEV (3/2005–4/2009, P2), and
post-RT-TMZ and post-BEV (5/2009–12/2013, P3). The association between calendar
period of diagnosis and survival was analyzed in SEER and TCR, separately, by the
Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. We found a significant
increase in median overall survival (OS) across the three periods in both populations.
In multivariate models, the risk of death was significantly reduced during P2 and
further decreased in P3, which remained unchanged after stratification. Comparison
and validation analysis were performed in the combined dataset, and consistent
results were observed. We conclude that the OS of GBM patients in a “real-world”
setting has been steadily improved from January 2000 to December 2013, which likely
resulted from the administrations of TMZ concomitant with RT and adjuvant TMZ for
newly diagnosed GBM and then BEV for recurrent GBM after respective FDA approval.

of the MGMT gene, Noushmehr et al [8] revealed that
glioma cytosine–phosphate–guanine islands methylator
phenotype (G-CIMP) is a positive prognostic marker.
Furthermore, two studies have categorized GBM into
3 subtypes [mesenchymal (Mes), proneural (PN) and
proliferative] [9], or 4 subtypes (Mes, PN, neuronal and
classical) [10], respectively. Among all the subtypes of

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) comprises
approximately 46.1% of primary malignant brain tumors,
and only about 5.1% of patients survive five years after
diagnosis [1]. Favorable clinical prognostic factors
include maximum safe resection, good performance
status, young age at diagnosis, completion of radiation
and chemotherapies [1], [2], [3], [4]. Molecular prognostic
factors include the presence of the O6-methylguaninewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GBM, Phillips et al [9] found that PN GBM patients has
the best prognosis.
Stupp and colleagues from the European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) Brain Tumor and Radiotherapy Groups and
the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical
Trials Group demonstrated that median overall survival
(OS) of GBM patients improved to 14.6 months with
concurrent radiation therapy and temozolomide (RTTMZ) followed by TMZ alone for 6 cycles in a phase
III randomized controlled trial (RCT) published in
March 2005 [11]. On March 15, 2005, the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved TMZ, an oral
alkylating agent, in concurrent usage with RT followed
by maintenance treatment with TMZ as a new standard
of care (SOC) for newly diagnosed adult GBM [12]. For
patients with recurrent GBM prior to FDA approval of
bevacizumab (BEV), various therapies had been applied
including second craniotomy with or without carmustine
implantation (Gliadel wafers), salvage radiation, dosedense TMZ, nitrosoureas, carboplatin, PCV (procarbazine,
lomustine and vincristine), etoposide or irinotecan [13],
[14], [15], [16]. Based on the results of two phase II
trials by Friedman et al (AVF3708g) [17] and Kreisl at
al (National Cancer Institute 06-C-0064E) [18], BEV, a
humanized monoclonal antibody against the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), received accelerated
approval for recurrent GBM therapy by FDA on May 9,
2009 [19].
It is known that GBM patients enrolled in RCTs
have better prognosis and longer survival than those
who were not enrolled in clinical trials [20]. Participants
in clinical trials need to pass stringent selection criteria,
including good performance status, satisfactory laboratory
parameters, minimal comorbidity, normal organ status,
and adequate bone marrow function [11], [17], [18].
Therefore, the impacts of RT-TMZ followed by TMZ
and subsequently BEV for recurrent GBM on survival
in a “‘real-world’ setting” should be further investigated.
Four population-based studies concluded that the usage of
TMZ [21], [22], [23], [24] was associated with improved
GBM survival based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) Program database. The time
periods of GBM diagnosis studied in these four studies
were 1993-2007, 2000-2006, 2001-2007 and 2000-2008,
respectively. One limitation of the SEER database is the
absence of individual patient’s chemotherapy information.
Dubrow et al [25] demonstrated that application of TMZ
can fully explain the improved OS among GBM patients
diagnosed between 1997 and 2008 from the Veterans
Health Administration (VHA) dataset which had the
access to individual chemotherapy data.
The impact of BEV on progression-free survival
(PFS) and OS for newly diagnosed GBM has been
investigated by two separate phase III RCTs. Chinot et
al (AVAglio) [26] and Gilbert et al (RTOG 0825) [27]
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrated that application of BEV during RT-TMZ
period does not improve OS in newly diagnosed GBM
patients compared to the control arms, independently. But
they cannot conclude whether BEV therapy was beneficial
to GBM patients or not overall, since patients from the
control arms received BEV as well after GBM progression.
Two population-based studies reported positive impact
of BEV on OS of GBM patients by utilizing the SEER
database [28], [29]. But there are limitations in those two
studies: 1) Both of them performed analyses with limited
follow up durations; 2) The usage of BEV was estimated
based on three years of death records (2006, 2008 and
2010) from Johnson et al report [28]; 3) A limited number
of GBM patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 was
studied in Wachtel et al study [29]. In our opinion, they
may not achieve a meaningful comparison of OS between
pre-and post-BEV eras since BEV was approved by FDA
on May 9, 2009. Therefore, further investigations related
to the role of BEV on survival in “real-world” GBM
population are needed.
In the present study, we constructed a retrospective
cohort of patients diagnosed with GBM between January
2000 and December 2013 derived from the SEER, TCR
and a pooled data from both SEER and TCR. We aim to
test the hypotheses that the administration of TMZ and
BEV after FDA approval, respectively, would explain the
improved survival in GBM patients across three calendar
periods of diagnosis, and the findings in SEER, TCR and
the combined dataset would be consistent.

RESULTS
Patients demographic and clinical characteristics
in SEER and TCR datasets
Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical features
of grouped GBM patients at diagnosis. A total of 24578
GBM patients were extracted from the SEER dataset, and
21364 (86.9%) of them died during the observation period
between January 2000 and December 2013. From the TCR
database, 3779 (86.8%) GBM patients deceased within
the same period in a total of 4355 patients identified.
The majority of patients were more than 50 years old at
diagnosis with mean±standard deviation (SD): SEER,
61.2±12.9 years; TCR, 60.6±13.0 years, respectively, and
with male (SEER: 58.7%, TCR: 59.9%) and Caucasian
(SEER: 80.4%, TCR: 75.2%) predominate.
Most patients received surgery (SEER: 81.3%,
TCR: 82.7%) and adjuvant radiation (SEER: 81.1%,
TCR: 69.4%) as their first-line treatments. The proportion
of each baseline characteristic except for sex was
significantly different across the three calendar periods
of diagnosis in SEER. For TCR, the distributions of age
at diagnosis, race/ethnicity and radiation status differed
significantly across P1, P2 and P3. Within each calendar
period of diagnosis, the distributions of several factors

diagnosis (P < 0.001), race/ethnicity (P < 0.001), marital

and radiation (P < 0.001); P3, race/ethnicity (P < 0.001),
surgery (P = 0.021) and radiation (P < 0.001).

Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 present the hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from
Cox proportional hazards regression models in SEER,
TCR and the combined dataset, respectively. The HRs
for calendar period of diagnosis did not change after
controlling for different sets of covariates in multivariate
models (Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3 for SEER and
TCR; Model 1, Model 2, Model 3 and Model 4 for the
combined dataset), except for the TCR dataset. Based
on the analysis of the TCR database, the risk for death
during P3 was higher than that of P2 in age-sex adjusted
model, Model 1 and Model 2, but it decreased to 0.78
(HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.72-0.84) when adding surgery and
radiation as shown in Model 3 (Table 4). With P1 serving
as a reference group as shown in Model 3, there was a
significant reduction of risks of death during P2 and P3
periods in SEER (P2, HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.81–0.86; P3,
HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.74-0.79) and the combined dataset
(P2, HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.80–0.85; P3, HR: 0.76, 95%
CI: 0.73-0.78). For the combined dataset, we built up
Model 4 by adding “cancer registries” in the covariates of
Model 3, and found that the HRs during P2 and P3 were
unchanged comparing results in Model 3. Additionally,
the risks of death derived from age-sex adjusted model,
Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3 remained stable in TCR
with extended follow-up (Supplementary Table 3).
The crude Kaplan–Meier survival estimates
and direct adjusted survival results based on Model 3
(SEER and TCR) or Model 4 (the combined dataset) are
presented in Figure 1. Figure 2 and Figure 3 displayed
survival curves stratified by age group at diagnosis.
The trend and pattern of survival were consistent
across three datasets, but the survival curve for P3 was
nearly identical to that of P2 in TCR (Figure 1). After
stratification by age group, survival distributions became
worse with advancing age, but the improved survival
across calendar periods was still preserved within each
stratum of age groups in SEER and the combined dataset
(Figure 2 and Figure 3). However, the survival curve
during P2 was superior to that of P3 among the group
of aged ≥ 70 in TCR. Similar patterns of survival were
observed in TCR with extended follow-up, except the
survival curve during P3 which was identical to that of
P2 in the elderly patients (aged ≥ 70) (Supplementary
Figure 2). In stratification analyses by age at diagnosis,
tumor site, surgery and radiation status, the decreased
HR over calendar period within each stratum of
stratified variables was observed in SEER, TCR, the
combined dataset (Table 6) and TCR with extended
follow-up (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, we have
conducted a sub-analysis in an analytic cohort (aged ≥
18 years old), and the results were consistent with the
findings presented above (Data not shown).

Survival results in SEER, TCR and the
combined dataset
As shown in Table 2, the median OS for P1, P2 and
P3 were 8, 10 and 11 months in SEER (log-rank test, P
< 0.001), 9, 10 and 11 months in TCR (log-rank test, P <
0.001), and 8, 10 and 11 months in the combined dataset
(log-rank test, P < 0.001), respectively. The differences in
OS of P1 versus P2 (log-rank test, P < 0.001), P1 versus
P3 (log-rank test, P < 0.001), and P2 versus P3 (log-rank
test, P < 0.001) were statistically significant in SEER
and the combined dataset. Analysis of the TCR dataset
revealed a significant improved survival from P1 to P2,
and from P1 to P3, but no significant effect from P2 to P3
was detected (log-rank test, P = 0.833).
After performing Chi-square test with Schouten
correction, 1-year survival rate increased significantly
over the three calendar periods and reached a peak in
P3 in SEER (P1: 33.6%, P2: 42.1%, and P3: 45.1%; P
< 0.001 for P1 versus P2, P1 versus P3, and P2 versus
P3) and the combined dataset (P1: 34.0%, P2: 42.2%,
and P3: 45.0%; P < 0.001 for P1 versus P2, P1 versus
P3, and P2 versus P3). For the TCR dataset, a significant
improvement was found in 1-year survival rate from P1 to
P2 (P1: 36.1%, P2: 42.5%; P < 0.001 for P1 versus P2),
from P1 to P3 (P1: 36.1%, P3: 44.5%; log-rank test, P <
0.001 for P1 versus P3), but no significant survival rate
difference was observed from P2 to P3 (P2: 42.5%, P3:
44.5%; P = 0.306 for P2 versus P3). Interestingly, from P1
to P2, 2-year survival rate elevated significantly in SEER
(P1: 12.6%, P2: 18.8%), TCR (P1: 13.3%, P2: 20.4%) and
the combined dataset (P1: 12.7%, P2: 19.1%), while no
significant difference in 2-year survival rate between P2
and P3 was found in all three datasets (Table 2).
Comparing survival functions between SEER
and TCR, the results from the two datasets revealed no
significant difference in P1 (log-rank test, P = 0.265) and
P2 (log-rank test, P = 0.874), but varied significantly in P3
(log-rank test, P = 0.021). The log-rank tests for a trend of
OS over calendar period of diagnosis were significant in
SEER, TCR and the combined dataset (Table 2 and Figure
1). Since the TCR dataset offers patients with longer
follow-up period up to May 2015, we did a sub-analysis
of the dataset including the extended follow-up period.
It revealed a prolonged median OS in P3 (12.0 months)
and significantly improved survival during P3 period
(P2 versus P3, P < 0.001) (Supplementary Table 2 and
Supplementary Figure 1).

DISCUSSION

to P2 in TCR was not significant (P = 0.833). There was
no survival benefit observed in 1-year or 2-year survival
rate between P2 and P3 in TCR, nor 2-year survival
rate between P2 and P3 in SEER and in the combined
dataset. One explanation for the reduced survival in
P3 comparing to P2 in TCR could be related to the
lower proportion of patients received radiation during
P3. The proportion of patients treated with radiation
therapy in TCR decreased from 80.8% to 69.8% and
to 60.1% in P1, P2, and P3, successively. However,
when we did a sub-analysis of the extended follow-up
of the TCR dataset up to May 2015, we found that the
difference in survival between P2 and P3 was significant
(Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 2).
This finding indicated that the survival benefit of BEV
could be observed when given longer period of followup and that may compensate the loss of benefit with
lower radiation proportion in P3. Another factor may
contribute to the improved GBM survival observed in
P3 with extended follow-up period was the availability
of broader insurance coverage in Texas, which may
translate to more applications of BEV in 2014 and 2015.

Prior analysis of RCTs [11], [30] and populationbased studies demonstrated that administration of TMZ
significantly improved the OS for patients with GBM
[21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [31]. Since FDA accelerated
approval of BEV for progressive GBM on May 9, 2009,
two SEER-based studies focused on the impact of BEV
on OS in general GBM population [28], [29]. Both studies
suggested that the addition of BEV to GBM treatment
improved OS among GBM patients. However, the two
studies had limited methods of categorizing patients and
statistical analyses, limited number of GBM patients
and short follow-up period after FDA approval of BEV.
Therefore, more new investigations of general GBM
patients in “real-world” setting with longer period of
follow-up are needed to examine the effect of BEV on OS
of GBM patients after FDA approval.
Our findings suggested that OS and 1-year survival
rate improved significantly across calendar period of
diagnosis in SEER, TCR and the combined dataset,
except that the improved survival within P3 compared

Since the implementation of Affordable Care Act (ACA)
Marketplace in Texas in January 2014, the uninsured
rate in Texas dropped from 22.1% (2013) to 19.1%
(2014), while the uninsured rate in Texas remained the
highest across the nation. The uninsured rate nationally
reduced from 14.5% (2013) to 11.7% (2014) [32], [33].
While analyzing the cohorts according to different
age groups at diagnosis, we found that the survival benefit
across P1, P2 and P3 decreased with increasing age: the
patients at 20-49 years old group had the most improved
survival in P3 comparing to P2, but the elderly GBM
patients (age at diagnosis ≥ 70 years old) showed limited
OS benefit in SEER and even reduced survival in TCR
from P2 to P3 periods. This diminished OS benefit along
with advancing age is intriguing. It could be related to
three possible explanations: first, for elderly patients (age
at diagnosis ≥ 70 years), physicians might not prescribe
SOC due to relatively shorter life expectancy considering
their ages and limited tolerance, and may apply to standard
or short course radiation only with avoiding using TMZ
or BEV or both. Second, IDH1/2 mutations occur more
frequently in younger patients, and these patients have an
improved OS than those with wild-type IDH genes which
is the case for nearly all de novo GBM of the elderly [34],
[35]. However, these two reasons are less likely to be valid
since there is no known evidence of changes of physician
treatment routine for GBM patients except FDA approval
of new therapies, nor gene pool alteration of GBM patients
over the past 13 years. The third reason is the most likely

explanation of this observation in our opinion. It is related
to different mechanisms of GBM tumor pathogenesis and
responses to BEV between young and elderly patients.
By performing retrospective analysis of the AVAglio trial,
Sandmann et al revealed that GBM patients with IDH1
mutation and PN subtype were more likely to obtain
OS benefit from BEV therapy during first-line treatment
[36]. Given the fact that elderly GBM patients are more
likely to be IDH1 wild-type and Mes subtype of GBM
than younger patients [34], [35], [36], they may not draw
survival benefit with BEV therapy as younger patients do
(see P3, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Table 6). The disparity of
deriving survival benefit from BEV in different age groups
reminds us that personalized strategy of GBM treatment,
such as drug selection, is critical for improving GBM
patient’s outcomes in the future.
The survival patterns between SEER and TCR were
similar across calendar period of diagnosis in Figure 1,
but differed significantly within P3 by applying the logrank test. This difference might be attributed to the smaller
sample size, reduced proportion of radiation received in
TCR population as mentioned above or other potential
factors we cannot obtain detailed data in this study,
including insurance coverage rate, socioeconomic status
and access to health care resources in Texas versus the
18 regions of SEER registries [33]. Possible biological
mechanisms for the impact of TMZ on the prolonging
survival of GBM patients could be explained by the drugrelated alkylation of DNA which interferes with GBM cell

in all three cohorts for the follow-up duration of 4 years
since FDA approval in 2009. We believe BEV alone or in
combination with TMZ or other chemo-radiation therapies
have a therapeutic effect on extending survival of GBM
patients.
Median OS and 1-year or 2-year survival rate in
our study were lower than those reported from previous
clinical trials in GBM patients including RT-TMZ
[11], Dose-Dense (DD) TMZ [41], TMZ+TTFields

DNA replication, the depletion of MGMT repair enzyme
activity [37], [38] or methylation of the MGMT promoter
[5] after receiving the RT-TMZ. Two studies [39], [40]
indicated that BEV has glucocorticoid-like and steroidsparing effects which was nicknamed as “super-steroid”
and has resulted in diminished glucocorticoids dosage
or need, reduction in edema or possibly in tumor size.
However, it is unlikely that steroid-like effect alone can
produce such significant durable survival benefit observed

Two-year survival rate during P2 (SEER: 18.8%, TCR:
20.4% and the combined dataset: 19.1%) was lower than
those reported in RCTs (26.5% in EORTC-NCIC trial [11],
34.2% in RTOG 0525 trial [41] and 29% in EF-14 trial
[42]) (Supplementary Table 1).
A similar pattern was observed for the impact of
BEV on GBM survival given our result of median OS

during P3 (11.0 months) was approximate 30-35% lower
than that of RTOG 0825 trial (15.7 months in BEV arm)
[27] and AVAglio (BO21990) trial (16.8 months with
BEV+RT-TMZ) [26]. In the present study, 1-year survival
rate was improved significantly from P2 to P3 in SEER
and the combined dataset, but significant improvement
in 2-year survival rate from P2 to P3 was not detected.
These findings were in accord with Chinot et al study

in BEV+RT-TMZ arm, P = 0.049, but no significance
found in 2-year survival rate between BEV+RT-TMZ
arm and Placebo+RT-TMZ arm, P = 0.240). The apparent
difference in survival between our study and prior RCTs
might be explained by selection bias favoring RCTs. For
example, all clinical trials patients were selected with
good performance status, younger age ranges, adequate

hematologic, cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic function
without significant comorbidity [11], [26], [27], [41], [42]

applied different classification of time periods [21], [23],
[24], [25], [28], [29], [31]. The majority of studies on
TMZ set 2005 as the cut-off between pre-TMZ and postTMZ eras based on SEER [21], [24] and their results were
consistent with our findings within P1 and P2 periods
(Supplementary Table 1). Two other studies were based
on the VHA database in the U.S. and NPD linked CRN
in Norway, respectively, which were independent cohorts
from SEER. These studies confirmed and substantiated
the beneficial effect of TMZ on GBM survival after
the introduction of TMZ concurrent with radiation and
adjuvant TMZ. They reported similar median OS and
survival rate to our findings.
Two other studies examined the potential survival
benefit after the administration of BEV for GBM treatment
in “real-world” settings. The conclusion in our study was
in agreement with the findings reported by Johnson et al
[28]. But they ascertained the time window based on three
years of death records and demonstrated that the median
OS for the patients deceased in 2006, 2008 and 2009
was 8, 7 and 9 months, respectively, whereas no 1-year
or 2-year survival rates were presented and all analyses
were performed by Mann-Whitney U tests or a log-rank
test. Wachtel et al [29] reported 1-year survival rate of the
time periods as 31.8% (Jan 2000-Jun 2003), 37.3% (Jul
2003-Mar 2005), 41.0% (Apr 2005–Oct 2007) and 43.0%
(Nov 2007–Dec 2009), which was in consonance with the
survival rates reported in our study. However, Wachtel et
al defined BEV-TMZ era as “November 2007–December
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

2009” based on Vredenburgh et al study, a phase II trial
result for BEV, which was published in October 2007 [43].
Further, they had no access to the sufficient study subjects
who were diagnosed GBM after FDA approval of BEV
since their time period of GBM diagnosis was Jan 2000
- Dec 2009. Therefore, they could not provide adequate
evidence to prove the prolonged survival benefit after
BEV FDA approval (Supplementary Table 1).
The strengths of the present study include: First,
we addressed the research question by using two
independent population-based datasets with larger sample
sizes, longer follow-up periods comparing to previously
reported studies [28], [29] and applicable adjustment of
demographical and clinical covariates. Second, our paper
is the first to explore the association between calendar
period of GBM diagnosis and OS in TCR, which is an
independent collection of GBM patients from SEER but
using a similar standard method of data collection and
management to SEER. Third, we also compared survival
functions between SEER and TCR within each grouped
calendar period and across all periods (including multicomparison among P1, P2 and P3), and re-ran all the
analyses based on the combined dataset and TCR with
extended follow-up, which served as validation analyses
and confirmed our initial observations. Fourth, in Dubrow
et al study, the proportion of TMZ usage in the adjuvant
chemotherapy increased from 28% (2001-2004) to
71% (2005-2008), and the median time to initiate TMZ
therapy reduced to 1.0 months in 2005-2008 (lowest
44026

across all three time periods), which indicated that there
is an speedy process of administration of TMZ after FDA
approval and patients could obtain TMZ with minimal
delay. Arvold et al [44] defined the TMZ era as June 1,
2005 - December 31, 2009, in SEER-Medicare database
because they believed TMZ could be widely available in
the US after FDA approval. In this regard, we believe FDA
approval date can represent the start date of insurance
coverage and physician’s prescriptions with minimal
delays. This is an appropriate proxy to the time-point that
majority of qualified GBM patients began to receive TMZ
and BEV, respectively. Although there is a delay during
implementation of insurance coverage, the interval of
delay is very short in this population since there are very
limited options of therapies for GBM and the prognosis is
extremely poor. This method of categorization could avoid
uncertain transition periods and facilitate interpretation.
Fifth, we performed stratification analysis, Cox
proportional hazards model and direct adjusted survival
curves by taking the potential time-varying covariates into
account.
There are limitations of the current study: First, the
present study was based on a retrospective cohort study,
which means the difference in OS among the calendar
period of diagnosis could be influenced by confounding
factors. To limit the effects from confounders, we have
adjusted varied combinations of covariates during the
model selection and still achieved consistent results.
Second, both SEER and TCR do not offer detailed
clinical data, such as performance status, chemotherapy
drugs received, numbers of craniotomies with or without
Gliadel wafers carried out, salvage radiation or stereotactic
radiosurgeries performed, molecular profiles (MGMT [41],
IDH1/2) results, as well as direct causes of death, which
may influence our ascertainment of OS. Third, other
factors may contribute OS variations that are not available
in SEER or TCR, including socioeconomic status, access
to health insurance, complications or adverse events
related to TMZ or BEV. The prior RCTs indicated that the
usage of BEV would be associated with an elevated risk of
side effects, such as hypertension, thromboembolic events,
intestinal perforation or intracranial hemorrhage [26], [27].
Therefore, further studies including the above-mentioned
aspects would be necessary to confirm the beneficial effect
of TMZ and BEV on OS among GBM patients.

between concurrent TMZ with radiation, adjuvant TMZ
for newly diagnosed GBM followed by BEV for recurrent
GBM and successive increased survival in the thirteen
years period based on a retrospective population-based
analysis, the improved OS was likely resulted from the
administrations of TMZ with radiation and adjuvant TMZ
and then BEV after FDA approval, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study settings and populations
The latest database of the SEER Program (released
on April 15, 2016) included cancer incidence and survival
data across 18 population-based cancer registries in the
United States (Connecticut, New Jersey, Detroit, Iowa,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Atlanta, rural Georgia, greater
Georgia, Hawaii, New Mexico, Seattle-Puget Sound, Utah,
San Francisco-Oakland, San Jose-Monterey, Los Angeles,
greater California, Alaska), covering approximately 30%
of the U.S. population from January 2000 to December
2013. We requested access to the data and obtained
permission from the National Cancer Institute (NCI),
Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences,
Surveillance Research Program. The details of description,
recruitment methodology, quality of control and followup protocols about SEER program were described
elsewhere [45]. The TCR Limited-Use database for cancer
diagnosed from 1995 to 2013, which is not included in
the SEER database, has been developed since 1979 by
the Texas Department of State Health Services, including
demographics, clinical characteristics, and survival
information. The variable settings of core data in TCR
are similar to those collected in the SEER database and
meet the high-quality data standards by National Program
of Central Cancer Registries (NPCR), and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention [46].
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) was defined by
International Classification of Disease for Oncology,
third edition (ICD-O-3) coded as 9440, 9441, or 9442
[21], [22], [24], [47], with topography codes C710-C719
and malignant brain neoplasm (behavior code was 3).
Subjects were excluded due to the following criteria: age
at diagnosis less than 20 years old; not primary tumors;
patients diagnosed only from autopsy or from death
certificate; not microscopically-confirmed; unknown race,
marital status; the extent of surgery; or radiation therapy
status and lack of survival data [21], [22], [23], [48], [49].
The final analytic dataset was limited to 24,578 and 4,355
GBM patients in SEER and TCR, respectively, and we
also combined these two datasets for validation analysis.
Since TCR offers longer follow-up period until May 2015,
we did sub-analysis of P3 including the extended followup period and the results are reported in supplemental
tables.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on a population-based, retrospective study of
two independent datasets, SEER and TCR as well as the
pooled database from both datasets, we demonstrated that
there was a significantly improved OS across the calendar
period of GBM diagnosis from January 2000 to December
2013. In multivariate models, the survival benefit over
calendar period remained unchanged after stratification.

Predictors, covariates, and outcome

included into models by adjusting the different sets of
covariates: Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3 for SEER
and TCR; Model 1, Model 2, Model 3 and Model 4 for
the combined dataset (See details in Table 3, Table 4 and
Table 5). The models were conducted to estimate HRs
(95% CI) by adjusting for the potential confounding
factors. After testing the proportional hazard assumption,
the interactions between time and age at diagnosis, tumor
site, surgery and radiation on OS were significant. Hence,
stratified analysis Cox model was performed by involving
the time-varying effect of age at diagnosis, tumor site,
surgery and radiation. We obtained direct adjusted
survival curves based on Model 3 for SEER, TCR, and
Model 4 for the combined dataset, which computed the
average of estimated survival curves for each patient,
instead of generating adjusted curves by applying means
of covariates [53], [54]. All statistical analyses were
performed with Stata 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX) and SAS (Version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
P values were two-sided and considered statistically
significant at P < 0.05.

Since detailed chemotherapy regimens were not
available in SEER and TCR, we separated the study
cohorts into three groups based on the FDA approval
dates of TMZ as concurrent use with RT and then BEV,
respectively: January 2000–February 2005 (pre-RT-TMZ
and pre-BEV, P1), March 2005–April 2009 (post-RT-TMZ
and pre-BEV, P2), and May 2009–December 2013 (postRT-TMZ and post-BEV, P3). Covariates included age at
diagnosis (20–49, 50–59, 60–69, ≥ 70 years), sex, race/
ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic and Others) and marital
status (single, married, separated, divorced, or widowed).
Tumor location (topography codes C710-C719) was
also considered in this analysis [50], [51]. The relevant
treatment variables included the extent of surgery (no
surgery, local excision/biopsy, partial resection and
gross total resection) [24], [50], [52] and radiation status
(untreated and treated) [22], [24]. Since the cutoff of the
last follow-up varied between SEER (December 31, 2013)
and TCR (553 patients were followed up to May 2015),
we set our cutoff date as December 31, 2013 in both SEER
and TCR, which means we censored those who were
still alive by December 31, 2013 in TCR. The primary
endpoint was OS, which was defined as the subsequent
months from diagnosis to the date of death due to any
cause or the date of last follow-up or December 31, 2013.
We also performed sub-analysis in TCR with extended
follow-up up to May 2015, which could provide data for a
longer term follow-up of OS associated with the usage of
BEV in GBM patients.

Descriptive statistics were used to depict and
compare the cohort characteristics by calendar period
of diagnosis using Mann-Whitney U test or Pearson's χ2
test. OS was assessed by applying Kaplan-Meier method
and the difference between survival curves was tested by
the two-sided log-rank test. Median OS, 1-year or 2-year
survival rate (%) were calculated in patients who were
observed for at least 1 or 2 years, and the difference in
1-year or 2-year survival rate across calendar period of
diagnosis was tested by two-sided Chi-square test with
Schouten correction. Univariate and multivariate analysis
were applied by Cox proportional hazards model. In
multivariate analysis, calendar period of diagnosis was
