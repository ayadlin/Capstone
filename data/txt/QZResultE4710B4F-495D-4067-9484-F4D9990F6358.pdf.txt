ABSTRACT
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is generally treated by chemotherapy and there is
an unmet medical need for novel targeted therapies or combination therapies. Using
in vitro screening, we have identified the combination of ibrutinib, an inhibitor of
the tyrosine kinase BTK, and AZD2014, an mTOR catalytic inhibitor, as being highly
synergistic in killing ABC-subtype DLBCL cell lines. Simultaneous inhibition of BTK
and mTOR causes apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo and results in tumor regression
in a xenograft model. We identify two parallel mechanisms that underlie apoptosis in
this setting: cooperative inhibition of cap-dependent translation, and the inhibition
of an NF-κB/IL10/STAT3 autocrine loop. Combined disruption of these pathways is
required for apoptosis. These data represent a rational basis for the dual inhibition
of BTK and mTOR as a potential treatment for ABC-subtype DLBCL.

INTRODUCTION

of diverse pathways including NF-κB, MAPK, PKC,
and AKT. BTK is essential for activation of NF-κB
by the BCR through degradation of IκBα[9-10]. The
discovery of an irreversible inhibitor of BTK, known as
ibrutinib, represents a major advance in the therapeutic
inhibition of BCR signaling. Ibrutinib has shown
promise in the treatment of several hematological
malignancies, including CLL[11], AML[12], and mantle
cell lymphoma[13]. Initial studies have found that
ibrutinib shows therapeutic activity in some ABC-type
DLBCL, but not GCB-type[14]. Other specific inhibitors
have shown promise as targeted therapies in DLBCL,
including those for BCL2[15] and mTOR[16]. mTOR is
a clinically validated target on the PI3K-Akt signalling
pathway, which is the most frequently deregulated
pathway in human cancers.  Rapamycin and its analogues,
everolimus and temsirolimus, are allosteric inhibitors of
the mTOR complex mTORC1 that have been evaluated
for the treatment of haematological malignancies and
temsirolimus is approved for the treatment of MCL.
Everolimus, an mTORC1-specific inhibitor, is cytostatic
in DLBCL but does not induce apoptosis as a single
agent[16]. Everolimus demonstrated proof of principle
for mTORC1 inhibitors in DLBCL patients but activity

DLBCL is an aggressive hematological malignancy
and one of the most common types of non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. DLBCL is often classified as one of two
subtypes: Germinal Center B cell-like (GCB) and
Activated B Cell-like (ABC)[1]. Of these, the ABC
subtype is more aggressive and is characterized by
activation of the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway and
high NF-κB activity[2], frequently through mutations
in regulators of these pathways[3]. Inhibitors of BCR
and NF-κB signaling are selectively toxic to ABC-type
tumors[4-5], in accordance with data demonstrating
that GCB-type tumors do not show activation of the
BCR pathway. The current standard of care for DLBCL
is R-CHOP, the combination of a monoclonal antibody,
rituximab, with a cocktail of chemotherapy agents, but
while this drug combination is effective in the majority
of cases, many tumors are insensitive or relapse after
treatment [6-7]. Overall, approximately 40% of patients
do not respond to current therapies, underscoring the need
for novel treatment strategies[8].
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a critical
mediator of BCR signaling which regulates the activation

was modest and resistance was frequent, possibly through
an escape mechanism that involved activation of AKT
which in part is regulated through mTORC2[17]. Given
that single agents have achieved only moderate efficacy,
the use of combination therapies is a potentially valuable
approach[18].
AZD2014 is an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor
which can block the activity of both the mTORC1
(rapamycin-sensitive) and mTORC2 (rapamycininsensitive) complexes and is highly selective against
PI3K superfamily kinases[19]. Dual mTORC1/2 inhibition
is anticipated to achieve greater clinical benefit than
rapalogues by abrogating a resistance feedback mechanism
activated when mTORC1 is inhibited. AZD2014 has
been reported to have greater potency than rapamycin
against mTORC1 and a superior pharmacokinetic profile
compared to some other second generation mTOR
inhibitors [20]. It has been shown to have antitumor
activity in vivo, in models of ER+ breast cancer and
glioblastoma, and has reached Phase II clinical trials in
renal cancer and ER+ breast cancer[20-21].
Here we demonstrate that the combination of
ibrutinib and AZD2014 can strongly induce apoptosis in
ABC-type DLBCL. The mechanisms of action of these
compounds converge on the regulation of 4EBP1 and
cap-dependent translation (CDT) as well as JAK/STAT3
signaling and we reveal cross-talk between the NF-κB,
STAT3, and mTOR pathways. We show that inhibition
of both pathways is essential for efficient apoptosis. The
combination of the dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014
with a BTK inhibitor is therefore an attractive therapeutic
approach for patients with ABC-type DLBCL.

concentrations. However, in combination, AZD2014 and
ibrutinib were able to cause almost complete cell death
by 72 hours (Fig 1A and B, and S1A). Western blotting
for cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) showed that AZD2014 and
ibrutinib synergistically induce apoptosis in both OCILY10 and TMD8 cells (Fig 1C). We also tested this
combination in three GCB lines (HT, Karpas-422, and
OCI-LY19) in a comparison with TMD8 to determine
whether synergy is specific to the ABC subtype. None of
the GCB lines showed significant synergy compared to
TMD8 (Fig S1B). While AZD2014 was just as effective
in blocking proliferation in GCB as in ABC lines, ibrutinib
had little or no effect in GCB and the combination did
not induce apoptosis in these lines. This is consistent with
GCB lines being independent of BCR/NF-κB signaling.

Gene expression signatures
We sought to understand the biological
consequences of BTK and mTOR inhibition, singly and
in combination, in DLBCL. Using RNA sequencing we
profiled gene expression in TMD8 and LY10 at 2h, 6h, and
24h post-treatment. The 24h timepoint showed the most
significant changes in gene expression and was selected
for further analysis. The data was compared, using GSEA,
to gene sets specifically associated with hematopoietic
cells (Lymphochip) (Fig 2). Notably, both single agents
showed significant downregulation of signatures relating
to proliferation and the cell cycle, in accordance with
our data demonstrating growth arrest (Supplemental
Table 2). Signatures correlating with metabolic pathway
activation were also downregulated, as expected. We also
looked for gene signatures relating to known oncogenic
pathways in DLBCL. We found that ibrutinib resulted
in downregulation of NF-κB target genes, as expected.
While AZD2014 had only modest effects on NF-κB
signatures, notably among the genes most strongly
repressed by AZD2014 were several known NF-κB target
genes including CCL3 and CCL4 (Supplemental Table 3).
Signatures associated with the proto-oncogene c-MYC
were strikingly downregulated by ibrutinib and to a lesser
extent by AZD2014, with the combination having an
even more profound effect than ibrutinib alone. Finally,
STAT3 target genes were dowregulated by treatment with
Ibrutinib; AZD2014 had a lesser effect. High STAT3
activity has been shown to predict poor prognosis in
DLBCL[25]. These gene signatures indicate that Ibrutinib
and AZD2014 can modulate signaling pathways with
known oncogenic function in DLBCL.

RESULTS
Screening identifies combination of AZD2014 and
ibrutinib
To identify synergistic drug combinations for the
treatment of ABC-type DLBCL, we designed a screen
using the ABC cell lines TMD8 and OCI-LY10. These cell
lines were selected due to the presence of signature features
of ABC-type DLBCL, including activating mutations in
MyD88 and CD79B and high NF-κB activity[22-24]. We
assembled a list of compounds targeting pathways with
a known oncogenic function in lymphoma that possess
single agent activity. These compounds were analyzed
pairwise at a range of concentrations and cell viability
was measured by Alamar Blue assay. The highest scoring
combination was that of ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor
of the tyrosine kinase BTK, and the mTORC1/2 inhibitor
AZD2014 (Supplemental Table 1). As single agents,
these compounds were effective in blocking proliferation
but did not induce significant cell death even at high

by Western blot. We found that phosphorylation of STAT3
at Y705, which is mediated by JAK kinases and is critical
for its activation, is inhibited at 24h by ibrutinib and
AZD2014, but not at earlier timepoints (Fig 3A). NF-κB
pathway activation, as measured by phosphorylation of
IκBα, was reduced by 8h, preceding STAT3 inhibition
(Fig S2). We selected the 24 hour timepoint for further
analysis since it showed the greatest inhibition. We found
that ibrutinib strongly reduces pSTAT3 and that AZD2014
does so to a lesser degree (Fig 3B). The combination
of AZD2014 with ibrutinib did not inhibit pSTAT3 to a
greater extent than ibrutinib alone. The kinetics of STAT3
inhibition suggest that it is not a direct target of either
BTK or mTOR but might be regulated indirectly. JAK/
STAT3 is regulated by a number of cytokines, including
IL6 and IL10[26]. Cytokine profiling demonstrated that
both TMD8 and LY10 cells strongly express IL10 but

IL6 is only produced at low levels in TMD8 and is nearly
undetectable in OCI-LY10 (Fig S3). The receptors for
both IL6 and IL10 were expressed on the cell surface of
both TMD8 and LY10, suggesting that an autocrine loop
may be in effect in these cells (Fig S3). Measurement of
IL10 in conditioned medium by ELISA demonstrated
that treatment with either ibrutinib or AZD2014 reduced
secreted IL10 (Fig 3C). We measured transcription of
IL10 as well as IL6 by quantative PCR. Both ibrutinib and
AZD2014 reduced mRNA expression of both genes (Fig
3D). IL6 and IL10 are known targets of NF-κB[27-28].
To directly measure the inhibition of NF-κB signaling, we
created a stable NF-κB reporter line from TMD8 cells.
Treatment of these cells with either ibrutinib or AZD2014
inhibited luciferase activity, confirming that both BTK
and mTOR are upstream regulators of this pathway in
DLBCL (Fig 3E). The same result was obtained in 293T

cells transfected with a luciferase reporter construct (Fig
S4). Western blot analysis showed that both ibrutinib and
AZD2014 treatment reduce phosphorylation of IκBα at
24h and levels of pIκBα correlate with pSTAT3 (Fig 3F).
Collectively, these data suggest that a reduction in secreted
cytokines as a result of NF-κB inhibition leads to reduced
STAT3 activation.

sustained for at least 24 hours post-treatment. However,
even treatment with a high dose did not fully inhibit
4EBP1 phosphorylation at S65 in these cell lines. We
decided to determine whether ibrutinib could also affect
the mTOR pathway. While ibrutinib did not inhibit 4EBP1
phosphorylation at early time points, by 24 hours it
markedly reduced phosphorylation (Fig 4A). Surprisingly,
in combination with AZD2014, ibrutinib was able to
reduce 4EBP1 phosphorylation significantly compared to
AZD2014 alone (Fig 4B). While ibrutinib treatment alone
was able to inhibit phosphorylation of S6, another mTOR
target, at 24 hours, combination treatment did not further
reduce phosphorylation (Fig S5A). These data suggest
that while ibrutinib can reduce total mTOR activity it may
also regulate mTOR-independent mechanisms that control
4EBP1 phosphorylation.

4EBP1 is a regulator of cap-dependent translation
through its interaction with eIF4E. Phosphorylation of
4EBP1 at S65 inhibits its interaction with eIF4E and
permits the association of eIF4E with eIF4G and thus
translational initiation[29-30]. Since AZD2014 and
ibrutinib in combination synergistically inhibit S65
phosphorylation, we used 7-methyl-GTP beads to measure
assembly of the initiation complex required for CDT. In
agreement with our data on 4EBP1 S65 phosphorylation,
we found that combination treatment inhibited binding of
eIF4G to the cap to a much greater extent that treatment
with either single agent (Fig 4C). The proto-oncogene
c-MYC, a target of eIF4E, is translated through a
cap-dependent mechanism[31]. Inhibition of CDT in
DLBCL results in downregulation of c-MYC mRNA

expression[32]. As discussed earlier, GSEA identified
MYC as being strongly downregulated with ibrutinib/
AZD2014 treatment. We measured c-MYC protein
levels by Western blot and found that indeed c-MYC is
synergistically downregulated by ibrutinib and AZD2014,
in accordance with our hypothesis (Fig S5B). c-MYC is
an important driver of ABC-type DLBCL[33]; therefore
downregulation of c-MYC expression through activation
of 4EBP1 may contribute to the effect of ibrutinib/
AZD2014. In order to determine whether apoptosis was
the result of c-MYC downregulation, we made use of the
BRD4 inhibitor JQ1, which is known to downregulate
c-MYC transcription[34]. Treatment of TMD8 with JQ1
resulted in very strong downregulation of c-MYC (Fig
S5C) but little or no reduction in cell viability relative
to the ibrutinib/AZD2014 combination (Fig S5D). This
demonstrates that c-MYC downregulation is not sufficient
to explain apoptosis in this context.

Rescue of translation and STAT3 signaling
prevents apoptosis

this hypothesis we used siRNAs targeting 4EBP1 which,
by liberating eIF4E from the inhibitory interaction with
4EBP1, should result in constitutively high cap-dependent
translation. We found that pooled siRNAs could almost
completely knockdown 4EBP1 protein expression in OCILY10 cells. Indeed, when control and si4EBP1-treated
cells were treated with the combination, we observed
a significant reduction in cleaved caspase-3 with the
knockdown (Fig 5B). This suggests that reducing capdependent translation, which requires both inhibitors, is
critical for the activation of the apoptotic response.
These data led us to explore whether inhibition
of translation and JAK/STAT3 act together to cause
apoptosis. We tested combinations of treatments for their
effect on cell viability. We confirmed that treatment with
ibrutinib or AZD2014 alone did not result in reduced
viability but effectively blocked proliferation (Fig 5C and
D). The combination, as expected, caused almost complete
cell death within 72 hours. Addition of exogenous IL10
alone had only a modest protective effect on cells.
Knockdown of 4EBP1 alone had a greater protective
effect, although the majority of cells still underwent
apoptosis. However, when si4EBP1 and IL10 were both
administered, apoptosis as a result of ibrutinib/AZD2014
treatment was largely blocked. Interestingly, while these
treatments prevented apoptosis, they did not restore
proliferation, suggesting that the mechanisms through
which ibrutinib and AZD2014 arrest the cell cycle are
distinct from those that govern cell death.

Having identified pathways perturbed by ibrutinib
and AZD2014 treatment, we sought to understand
how these compounds induce apoptosis. We tested the
importance of IL10/JAK/STAT3 signaling in apoptosis
by stimulating drug treated cells with exogenous IL10.
IL10 stimulation partially restored pSTAT3 levels without
affecting 4EBP1 S65 phosphorylation in cells treated with
the inhibitors (Fig 5A). This suggests that inhibited STAT3
signaling is a consequence of reduced cytokine secretion
downstream of NF-κB. However, IL10 alone did not have
a major effect on cleaved caspase-3 (data not shown).
Given that inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation
and cap-dependent translation by the combination
correlates with cleavage of caspase-3 and cell death, we
conjectured that apoptosis induction by this combination
occurs as a result of reduced translation. In order to test

Combined inhibition of mTOR and BTK is
effective in vivo
The anti­tumor activity of AZD2014, Ibrutinib, and
combination of AZD2014 and Ibrutinib were evaluated in
female SCID mice bearing OCI-LY10 tumors. Twenty four
days after tumor cell inoculation mice were randomized
into treatment groups, vehicle control, AZD2014 (15 mg/
kg), ibrutinib (12 mg/kg), and combination of AZD2014
(15 mg/kg) and ibrutinib (12 mg/kg). Measurements of
tumor growth inhibition (TGI), and partial and complete
regression are shown in Figure S6A. Daily oral treatments
with AZD2014 and ibrutinib alone resulted in significant
(p-value, <0.0001) tumor growth delay (72% and 79%,
TGI, respectively) in OCI-LY10 xenografts. However,
neither treatment caused any partial or complete
regressions. Treatment with the combination of AZD2014
and ibrutinib demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor activity
with >100% TGI and five of the nine animals displaying
partial regressions and one animal resulting in complete
regression (Fig 6A and Fig S6). All treatments were
well tolerated with no body weight loss as with vehicle
control animals, (data not shown). To confirm our in vitro
mechanistic studies, we performed Western blot analysis
of lysates collected from LY10 xenografts after treatment.

DISCUSSION

These tumors showed synergistic inhibition of 4EBP1
phosphorylation as in vitro, while S6 phosphorylation
showed no such effect (Fig 6B). We confirmed inhibition
of pSTAT3 by immunohistochemical analysis of tumor
sections, in order to exclude the possibility of stromal
contamination. Combined treatment strongly reduced
the percentage of tumor cells positive for pSTAT3 in the
nucleus (Fig 6C). The striking synergistic inhibition of
pSTAT3 found in vivo did not match our finding in vitro
that combination treatment was not more effective than
ibrutinib alone. We hypothesized that this may be the
result of lower effective concentration of the inhibitors in
vivo compared to in vitro. To test this, we performed a
dose response in vitro. We saw that at low concentrations
of Ibrutinib, AZD2014 treatment was able to further
inhibit pSTAT3 (Fig S6B). These data demonstrate that
the combination of ibrutinib with AZD2014 is highly
effective in ABC-type DLBCL and acts through concerted
inhibition of multiple pathways to induce apoptosis.

Current targeted therapies have achieved only
partial success in targeting ABC-type DLBCL. We have
used in vitro screening technology to identify the novel
drug combination, ibrutinib and AZD2014, as being
highly and specifically cytotoxic to ABC DLBCL. While
ibrutinib or AZD2014 alone are able to efficiently prevent
cell proliferation, neither induces significant levels of
apoptosis, as measured by two cell viability assays and
caspase-3 cleavage. The combination of these two agents,
however, induces nearly universal apoptosis in treated
cells by 72 hours. We extended this finding in vivo by
showing that in OCI-LY10 xenografts ibrutinib and
AZD2014 alone are able to delay tumor growth, while
the combination results in significant tumor regression.
This synergistic combination effect appears to be specific
to ABC-type DLBCL, as several GCG cell lines failed to
respond similarly.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We have also investigated the mechanism through
which this drug combination is able to induce apoptosis.
By gene expression analysis and profiling of relevant
pathways, we found that STAT3 phosphorylation is
inhibited by both ibrutinib and AZD2014. Inhibition only
takes place at later timepoints, suggesting an indirect
mechanism. This could be explained by a reduction in the
transcription of cytokines which may act in an autocrine
loop to stimulate STAT3 phosphorylation through JAK.
Downregulation of cytokine expression appears to be the
result of NF-κB inhibition by these compounds, although
we cannot rule out an additional effect on translation.
While BTK is known to be an important regulator of NFκB in DLBCL, little information exists linking mTOR
to NF-κB regulation. While mTOR has been reported to
associate with the IKK complex to stimulate NF-κB in
prostate cancer cells[35], to our knowledge mTOR has
not been demonstrated to be a driver of NF-κB activity
in DLBCL.
We have also found that concomitant treatment of
cells with ibrutinib and AZD2014 reduces phosphorylation
of 4EBP1, an established mTOR target, much more
efficiently than AZD2014 alone. This raises the question of
how ibrutinib is inhibiting phosphorylation of this target.
Combination treatment did not inhibit phosphorylation
of S6, another downstream target of mTOR, to a greater
extent than AZD2014 alone. This suggests that BTK
regulates 4EBP1 phosphorylation through a pathway
distinct from mTOR. Several additional kinases have been
reported to regulate 4EBP1 including PIM1[36], p38α[37],
and LRRK2[38]. It is possible that BTK regulates
translation through the regulation of another kinase,
making cap-dependent translation partially independent
of mTOR inhibition. Our data support the intriguing
possibility that mTOR inhibition is not sufficient in
DLBCL to significantly reduce cap-dependent translation.
Furthermore, we found that loss of 4EBP1 and restoration
of autocrine IL10 signaling can mostly block the activation
of apoptosis in cells treated with ibrutinib and AZD2014.
Collectively, our data support a rational basis for
the co-inhibition of the kinases BTK and mTOR in ABCtype DLBCL. The efficacy of combined treatment with
ibrutinib and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in DLBCL has been
demonstrated in vitro[39]. Our data extend these findings
in vivo to show that AZD2014 and ibrutinib can robustly
inhibit tumor growth and even cause tumor regression.
Our mechanistic studies, supported by in vivo biomarkers,
provide an explanation for the synergistic activation of the
apoptotic response. We also identify significant crosstalk
between the mTOR, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT3 pathways in
DLBCL. In summary, simultaneous inhibition of BTK and
mTOR may be of significant clinical benefit.

supplemented with 20% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin,
and glutamine. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO.
Unless otherwise noted, all treatments with ibrutinib
were performed at 10nM; 200nM for AZD2014. Accell
siRNAs were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific
and were transfected at 1µM according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Recombinant IL10 was purchased from Cell

and ibrutinib either singly or in combination in a matrixbased 6 dose x 6 dose design. Alamar blue (10 μL,
10% of volume per well) was added and the cells were
further incubated at 37°C for 4 hours. Fluorescence
with excitation wavelength at 530–560 nm and emission
wavelength at 590 nm was measured. Cell growth was
determined at day zero (V0) before compound dosing
and after 72 h of treatment (T, V). Chalice Analyzer
(Zalicus Inc. Cambridge, MA) was used to convert the
data to 0-200% growth inhibition using the formula
T<V0 ? 100*(1-(T-V0)/V0) : 100*(1-(T-V0)/(V-V0)). This
supports interrogation of the data with cytostatic effects
in the 0-100% range and cytotoxic effects in the 100200% range. Synergy was measured by determination of
combination index (CI) or synergy score by comparison to
the Loewe additivity model.

Viral Transduction
DOTAP (10 µg/ml; Roche) was added to viral
supernatants and incubated at 4ºC for 10 minutes. Cells
were centrifuged, resuspended in viral supernatant/
DOTAP mixture, and then spun at 2500 rpm for 90
minutes at 32ºC. And equal volume of growth medium
was added and cells were allowed to recover for 48 hours
before puromycin selection (0.5 µg/ml escalating to 1.0
µg/ml after one week).

incubated for 30 minutes (room temperature, 300 rpm
agitation) with capture antibody-coupled magnetic beads.
Following three washes, samples were incubated for 30
minutes in the dark (room temperature, 300 rpm agitation)
with biotinylated detection antibody. Each captured
analyte was detected by the addition of streptavidinphycoerythrin and quantified using a BioPlex 100 array
reader. Analyte concentrations were calculated with BioPlex Manager software. For ELISA assays, supernatants
were collected after centrifugation at indicated timepoints
and then diluted 1:10 in plain medium. IL10 concentration
was measured the HUMAN IL-10 ELISA Kit II from BD
Biosciences.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in 1X lysis buffer (Cell Signaling)
supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Cell Signaling). Protein was quantified using
the Pierce BCA assay kit. 4X Sample Buffer and 10X
Reducing Agent (Life Technologies) were added and
samples were boiled for 5 minutes before loading. 4-12%
Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels were used with NuPAGE MES
SDS Running Buffer. Protein was transferred to Novex
Nitrocellulose membranes using NuPAGE Transfer Buffer.
Protein was detected using SuperSignal West Dura and
West Femto ECL (Pierce).

Flow Cytometry
Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in
PBS + 2% human serum for 10 minutes on ice. Surface
staining for IL-6R, IL-10R, and IgM (BD Pharmingen)
was performed in the dark for 30 minutes at 4°C. Cells
were washed twice in PBS + 2% FBS and fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde. Analysis was performed on a FACS
Canto II (Becton Dickinson). FlowJo software (TreeStar,
Inc.) was used to analyze flow cytometry data.

Cap-binding Assay
Cells were lysed in IP buffer (Cell Signaling),
quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and
200ug of total protein was incubated with 20ul of m7-GTPsepharose beads (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4°C. Beads
were centrifuged and washed three times in IP buffer. After
the final wash, the beads were boiled in Laemmli Buffer,
separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes.  Western blot analyses were performed using
the indicated antibodies from Cell Signaling Technologies:
α-eIF4G (#2498) and α-eIF4E (#9742).

Immunohistochemistry
OCI-LY10 tumors were harvested, trimmed and
immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for
24 hours. Fixed tumors were subjected to routine vacuum
processing through graded ethanol, xylene and paraffin.
Tumors were then embedded into paraffin blocks and
routinely sectioned at a thickness of 3μm. IHC was run
with an optimized protocol on the Ventana Discovery
XT using anti-Phospho-STAT3 primary antibody (Cell
Signaling Technologies CST9145), biotinylated antirabbit secondary antibody (Vector Labs PK-6101) and the
DABMap detection kit (Ventana Medical 760-124). Once
coverslipped, digital slide images were acquired with
the Aperio Scanscope XT using a 20X objective. Viable
tumor areas were manually selected in Aperio Imagescope
(version 11), and percent positive nuclei were quantified
using a modified Nuclear Algorithm (version 9).

qPCR
RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy kits
and cDNA was synthesized using High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems).
qPCR analysis was performed using Fast SYBR
Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a ABI
Prism 7900HT. The following primers were used:
IL6
(5’-ACTCACCTCTTCAGAACGAATTG-3’;
5’-CCATCTTTGGAAGGTTCAGGTTG-3’),
IL10
(5’-TCAAGGCGCATGTGAACTCC-3’;
5’-GATGTCAAACTCACTCATGGCT-3’).

deregulation of NF-kappaB in diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma. Nature. 2009; 459(7247):717-721.

Female CB.17 SCID mice, five to six weeks
old, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories
(Wilmington, MA). Upon receipt, the mice were
quarantined for minimum of three days prior to study
initiation. The mice showed no signs of disease or illness
upon arrival or prior to study initiation. The mice were
maintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council)
and food and water were available ad libitum. OCILY10 tumor cells (5.0 x 106 ) in serum-free medium with
matrigel (1:1 ratio) were injected subcutaneously into the
area under the right flank of each mouse. Tumors were
allowed to reach a volume of approximately 200 mm3 prior
to randomization into four treatment groups (n  =  9 per
group) by tumor volume. Treatments were administered
daily orally. A mouse was considered to have a partial
regression (PR) when tumor volume was reduced by
50% or greater, complete tumor regression (CR) when no
palpable tumor could be detected. AZD2014 was prepared
at 3 mg/ml in 20% captisol. Ibrutinib was prepared at 2.4
mg/ml in 0.5% methyl cellulose.
