Although gene and protein expression have been extensively profiled in human tumors, little is known
about the global metabolomic alterations that characterize neoplastic progression. Using a
combination of high throughput liquid and gas chromatography-based mass spectrometry, we
profiled more than 1126 metabolites across 262 clinical samples related to prostate cancer (42 tissues
and 110 each of urine and plasma). These unbiased metabolomic profiles were able to distinguish
benign prostate, clinically localized prostate cancer, and metastatic disease. Sarcosine, an N-methyl
derivative of the amino acid glycine, was identified as a differential metabolite that was highly
elevated during prostate cancer progression to metastasis and can be detected non-invasively in urine.
Sarcosine levels were also elevated in invasive prostate cancer cell lines relative to benign prostate
epithelial cells. Knockdown of glycine-N-methyl transferase (GNMT), the enzyme that generates
sarcosine from glycine, attenuated prostate cancer invasion. Addition of exogenous sarcosine or
knockdown of the enzyme that leads to sarcosine degradation, sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH),
induced an invasive phenotype in benign prostate epithelial cells. Androgen receptor and the ERG
gene fusion product coordinately regulate components of the sarcosine pathway. Taken together, we
profiled the metabolomic alterations of prostate cancer progression revealing sarcosine as a
potentially important metabolic intermediary of cancer cell invasion and aggressivity.

To profile the “metabolome” during prostate cancer progression, we used both liquid and gas
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry3 to interrogate the relative levels of
metabolites across 262 prostate-related biospecimens (outlined in Supplementary Fig. 1).
Specifically 42 tissue samples and 110 matched specimens of plasma and post-digital rectal
exam (DRE) urine from biopsy positive cancer patients (n=59) and biopsy negative control
individuals (n=51) were assayed (Fig. 1a). A total of 1126 metabolites were quantified and as
expected only a small percentage of these metabolites (10.6%) were shared across the disparate
biospecimen types (Fig. 1a).
Evaluation of the unbiased metabolomic profiles of plasma or urine did not identify robust
differences between biopsy positive and biopsy negative individuals. For plasma, 19 of 478
(4%) metabolites were differential (Wilcoxon P < 0.05) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of
99%. Likewise, for urine 34 of 583 (6%) metabolites were differential (Wilcoxon P < 0.05)
with an FDR of 64%. Thus, our initial focus was directed towards understanding the tissue
metabolomic profiles as they exhibited more robust alterations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tissue samples were derived from benign adjacent prostate (n=16), clinically localized prostate
cancer (n=12, PCA) and metastatic prostate cancer patients (n=14, Mets). Selection of
metastatic tissue samples from different sites (see Supplementary Table 2) minimized
characterization of analytes specific to cells of non-prostatic origin. In total, high throughput
profiling of the tissues quantitatively detected 626 metabolites (175 named, 19 isobars, and
432 metabolites without identification), of which 82.3% (515/626) were shared by the three
diagnostic classes (Fig. 1b). Notably, there were 60 metabolites found in PCA and/or metastatic
tumors but not in benign prostate. These profiles were displayed as a heat map (Fig.1c) and zscore plot (Fig. 1d). In the latter benign-based z-scores were plotted for each of the 626
metabolites. The plots revealed robust metabolic alterations in metastatic tumors (z-score
range: −13.6 to 81.9) compared to fewer changes in clinically localized prostate cancer samples
(z-score range: −7.7 to 45.8).
We identified the differential metabolites between the PCA and benign samples using a twosided Wilcoxon rank-sum test coupled with a permutation test (n = 1,000). A total of 87/518
metabolites were differential across these two classes (P<0.05, corresponding to a 23% FDR).
For visualizing the relationship between the 87 altered metabolites hierarchical clustering was
used to arrange the metabolites based on their relative levels across samples (Fig. 2a). Among
the perturbed metabolites, 50 were elevated in PCA while 37 were down-regulated. Fig. 2b
displays the relative levels of the 37 named metabolites that were differential between benign

prostate and PCA. Similarly, 124/518 metabolites were found to be elevated in the metastatic
samples compared to the localized tumors with 102 compounds down-regulated (P<0.05,
corresponding to a 4% FDR). Fig. 2c displays the levels of the 91 named metabolites altered
in metastatic samples. A subset of six metabolites including sarcosine, uracil, kynurenine,
glycerol-3-phosphate, leucine and proline were significantly elevated upon disease progression
from benign to PCA to Mets. These metabolites could potentially serve as biomarkers for
progressive disease, one of the factors that motivated us to examine sarcosine in greater detail.
Mapping the differential metabolomic profiles to their respective biochemical pathways as
outlined in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, release 41.1,
Supplementary Fig. 8) revealed an increase in amino acid metabolism and nitrogen breakdown
pathways during cancer progression to metastatic disease. A similar enrichment network of
amino acid metabolism was also identified by the bioinformatics tool Oncomine Concept
Map4,5(OCM, www.oncomine.org, P = 6 × 10−13, Supplementary Fig. 9, 10a), supporting our
earlier gene-expression-based prediction of androgen-induced protein synthesis as an early
event during prostate cancer development5. Additionally, OCM found strong enrichment for
elevated “methyltransferase activity” (Supplementary Fig. 10b, P = 7.7 × 10−8) among
metabolites up-regulated in metastatic samples. This corroborates previous studies from our
group and others showing elevation of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in metastatic tumors
6–11.

As amino acid metabolism and methylation were enriched during prostate cancer progression,
we focused on differential metabolites that characterize these processes and additionally show
a progressive elevation from benign to PCA to metastatic disease. The amino acid metabolite
sarcosine, an N-methyl derivative of glycine, fit these criteria. Notably, metastatic samples
showed markedly elevated levels of sarcosine in 79% of the specimens analyzed (Chi-square
test, P = 0.0538), whereas 42% of the PCA samples showed an increase in the levels of this
metabolite (Fig. 2a–c). Importantly, none of the benign samples had detectable levels of
sarcosine. Taken together this suggested the possible utility of sarcosine in monitoring disease
progression and aggressiveness.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm this pattern of sarcosine elevation in cancer progression we developed a highly
sensitive and specific isotope dilution GC/MS method for accurately quantifying the metabolite
from biospecimens (limit of detection = 10 femtomoles, Supplementary Fig. 11). In an
independent set of 89 tissue samples (Supplementary Table 6), sarcosine levels were
significantly elevated in PCA specimens (n=36) compared to benign adjacent prostate (n=25,
Wilcoxon P = 4.34 ×10−11, Fig 3a). Additionally, there was an even greater elevation of
sarcosine in metastatic samples (n=28) compared to organ-confined disease (Wilcoxon P =
6.02 × 10−11, Fig 3a). By contrast, sarcosine was undetectable in adjacent non-neoplastic tissues
from patients with metastatic disease (Supplementary Fig. 12a–c).
The above findings led us to explore the potential of sarcosine as a candidate for future
development in biomarker panels for early disease detection and aggressivity prediction.
Towards this end, we monitored its levels in urine specimens from biopsy positive and negative
individuals, a majority of whom have elevated PSA levels (>4.0 ng/ml), and in which prostate
needle biopsy was used for diagnosis. This is a particularly challenging cohort as not only are
these men at high risk for prostate cancer, even a negative needle biopsy does not rule out the
presence of cancer due to sampling issues. Sarcosine was found to be significantly higher in
urine sediments (n=49, Wilcoxon P = 0.0004, Fig 3b) and supernatants (n=59, Wilcoxon P =
0.0025, Supplementary Fig. 14a) derived from biopsy positive prostate cancer patients as
compared to biopsy negative controls (n = 44 and n= 51, respectively, Supplementary Table 7
and Table 8). The overall receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for sarcosine suggest
its predictive value is modest with AUCs of 0.71 and 0.67 for urine sediments and supernatants,

respectively (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). Notably an AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect prediction
and an AUC of 0.5 indicates prediction equivalent to random selection. Interestingly, when
restricted to samples having PSA in the clinical grey zone of 2–10 ng/ml (n=53), sarcosine
performed better than PSA in delineating the two diagnostic classes with an AUC of 0.69 (95%
CI: 0.55, 0.84) compared to an AUC of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.69) for PSA (Supplementary
Fig. 15). Thus, sarcosine may have potential to identify patients with modestly elevated PSA
that are likely to have a positive prostate biopsy.
To determine whether sarcosine elevation in prostate cancer has biological relevance, we
measured its levels in prostate cancer cell lines VCaP, DU145, 22RV1 and LNCaP (n=3 each)
and their benign epithelial counterparts, primary benign prostate epithelial cells (PrEC, n=2)
and immortalized benign RWPE prostate cells (n=3). Significantly elevated levels of the
metabolite were found in prostate cancer cells compared to the benign cells (ANOVA
P=0.0218, Fig. 3c). Additionally, sarcosine levels correlated well with cell invasiveness
(Spearman’s correlation coefficient: 0.943, P=0.0048). Based on our earlier findings that EZH2
over-expression in benign cells could mediate cell invasion and neoplastic progression6,10,
11,

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

sarcosine levels were assessed upon modulation of EZH2 expression. Interestingly, overexpression of EZH2 in benign prostate epithelial cells increased sarcosine levels (4.5 fold,
Supplementary Fig. 16a) while its knock-down in DU145 prostate cancer cells diminished the
levels of the metabolite (Supplementary Fig. 16 a–c). To determine if sarcosine may play a
more direct role in this process, we added the metabolite to non-invasive benign prostate
epithelial cells. Alanine, an isomer of sarcosine, was used as a control for these experiments.
Remarkably, the mere addition of exogenous sarcosine imparted an invasive phenotype to
benign prostate epithelial cells (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 17). Furthermore, the number of
motile prostate epithelial cells were significantly higher upon sarcosine treatment (t-test
P=6.997e-06, n=10) compared to alanine-treated controls (Supplementary Fig. 18). Sarcosine
treatment however did not affect the ability of these cells to progress through the different
stages of cell cycle (Supplementary Fig. 19a–d) or impair cell proliferation (Supplementary
Fig. 19e). Notably, glycine, a precursor of sarcosine, induced invasion in these cells, although
to a lesser degree than sarcosine (Fig. 3e). This invasion could result from the conversion of
glycine to sarcosine by the enzyme glycine-N-methyltransferase (GNMT) (Fig. 4a).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to GNMT, sarcosine levels are regulated by sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH),
the enzyme that converts sarcosine back to glycine and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase
(DMGDH) which generates sarcosine from dimethylglycine (Fig. 4a). By virtue of their ability
to control sarcosine levels in cells, these enzymes may assume a critical role in modulating
prostate cancer invasion. To test this hypothesis, a series of RNA interference-mediated knockdown experiments were carried out. Attenuation of GNMT (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 20)
in DU145 prostate cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction in cell invasion (t-test P=
0.0073, n=3) with a concomitant 3-fold decrease in the intracellular sarcosine levels compared
to control non-target siRNA-transfected cells. Similar knockdown experiments performed in
benign RWPE cells significantly hampered the ability of exogenous glycine (t-test P=0.0082,
n=3), but not sarcosine, to induce invasion (Supplementary Fig. 21a,b). Comparable loss of
cell invasion and reduction in sarcosine levels were also apparent in DU145 cancer cells upon
knock-down of DMGDH (Supplementary Fig. 22a,b). In contrast, knock-down of SARDH in
benign prostate epithelial cells resulted in approximately a 3-fold increase in endogenous
sarcosine levels with a concomitant > 3.5 fold increase in invasion (Fig. 4c, Supplementary
Fig. 23).
With the understanding that androgen signaling and ETS gene (ERG, ETV1) fusions are key
factors for prostate cancer progression12, we investigated their role in regulating GNMT and
SARDH. Treatment with androgen for 48h in VCaP (ERG positive) and LNCaP (ETV1
positive) prostate cancer cells resulted in a step-wise increase in GNMT expression and a

concomitant decrease in SARDH levels as assessed by digital gene expression and QPCR (Fig
4d, Supplementary Fig. 25e). This finding was supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChiP-Seq) which revealed direct binding of AR and ERG to the promoter of
GNMT in VCaP cells (Fig. 4e), while only ERG binding was seen on the SARDH promoter
(Fig. 4f). In ETV1 positive LNCaP cells, AR, but not ERG as expected, was bound to both
GNMT and SARDH promoters (Supplementary Figs. 25a,b). The binding data was validated
by ChIP-PCR (Supplementary Fig 24 a,b,d and 25 c,d) that additionally revealed weak binding
of AR to the SARDH promoter in VCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. 24 c). These findings
together directly link activation of the sarcosine pathway to AR and ETS gene fusion regulation,
two key mediators of prostate cancer progression. Remarkably, both ERG-and ETV1-induced
invasion were associated with a 3-fold sarcosine elevation in benign RWPE cells (Fig. 4h).
Similarly, knock-down of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in VCaP cells (Supplementary Fig.
26) resulted in > 3-fold decrease in sarcosine with a similar decrease in the invasive phenotype
(Fig 4h).

Taken together, we explored the “metabolome” of prostate cancer progression. This led to the
characterization of metabolomic signatures, which in the context of other molecular alterations,
may lead to a more complete understanding of disease progression. Specifically, we identified
sarcosine as a key metabolite elevated most robustly in metastatic prostate cancer and
detectable in the urine of men with organ-confined disease. Interestingly, sarcosine, and its
proximal regulatory enzymes, appear to play an intermediary role in neoplastic progression
modulating cell invasion and migration. The master transcriptional regulators of prostate
cancer progression, AR and the ETS gene fusions, appear to directly regulate sarcosine levels
via transcriptional control of its regulatory enzymes. Thus, components of the sarcosine
pathway may have potential as biomarkers of prostate cancer progression as well as serve as
novel avenues for therapeutic intervention.

Biospecimens and cell lines
Prostate tissues, urine and plasma were obtained from the the University of Michigan SPORE
and EDRN Tissue Core. All samples were collected with informed consent as per the approval
of the Institutional Review Board.
RWPE, DU145, LnCAP, and PC3 cells were obtained from ATCC, PrEC cells from Cambrex
BioScience, 22-RV1 was provided by J. Macoska and VCaP by K. Pienta. VCaP and LnCAP
were grown in charcoal stripped serum containing media for 24h, before treatment for further
24 h with vehicle or 1nM methyltrienolone (R1881, NEN) dissolved in ethanol.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Metabolomic Profiling was performed using the platform described in Lawton et al. (2008)
3 and outlined in Supplementary Fig 1. The LC/MS portion of the platform is based on a
Surveyor HPLC and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Corporation, Waltham, MA) with the instrument set for continuous monitoring of both positive
and negative ions. Samples that were analyzed by GC MS were derivatized under dried nitrogen
using bistrimethyl-silyl-triflouroacetamide (BSTFA) and analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan
Mat-95 XP using electron impact ionization (EI) and high resolution. For both LC and GC
mass spectrometry, spectral files were searched using metabolomic libraries created by
Metabolon that contain about 800 commercially available compounds.
Quantitation of target metabolites was performed using isotope dilution GC MS using selected
ion monitoring (SIM). The samples were modified to their t-butyl dimethylsilyl derivatives
and analyzed with an Agilent 5975 MSD mass detector using EI. For SIM analysis the m/z for
native and labeled molecular peaks for various target metabolites quantified were: 158 and 161
(sarcosine), 406 and 407 (cysteine), 432 and 437 (glutamic acid), 297 and 301 (thymine), and
218 and 219 (glycine), respectively. Assessment of citric acid was performed on the GC-MS
in the full scan mode.
Statistical Analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Missing data were imputed with zero for metabolites with mean measure >100,000 across
samples (i.e., missingness likely due to absence), otherwise one half of the sample minimum
was imputed (i.e., missingness likely due to censoring). Imputed data were median centered
and inter-quartile range (IQR) scaled per sample. Plotted z-scores were calculated based on
the mean and standard deviation of a reference set (benign samples, unless otherwise stated).
Hierarchical clustering14 based on Pearson’s correlation was performed on the log transformed
normalized data after median centering per metabolite. A small value (unity) was added to each
normalized value to allow log transformation. Per-metabolite chi-square tests were used to
assess class specific metabolite patterns of present and absent (undetected) measurements. Permetabolite two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for two-sample tests of association
between classes. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for three-way comparisons between all
diagnosis groups. Non-parametric tests were chosen to reduce the influence of the imputed
values. Tests were run on those metabolites with detectable expression in at least 20% of the
samples. Significance was determined using 1000 sample permutations False discovery rates
were calculated using the q-value conversion algorithm of Storey18. Pairwise differences in
expression in the cell line data and small scale tissue data were tested using two-tailed t-tests
with Satterthwaite variance estimation. Comparisons involving multiple cell lines used
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to adjust for the multiple measures per cell

line. Fold change was estimated using ANOVA on a log scale, following the model log(Y) =
A + B*Treatment + E. In this way exp(B) is an estimate of (Y | Treatment = 1)/(Y | Treatment
= 0) and the standard error of exp(B) can be estimated from SE(B) using the delta method. The
threshold for significance was P<0.05 for all tests.
ChIP-PCR
ChIP was carried out as previously described19 using antibodies against AR (Millipore), ERG
(Santa Cruz) and rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz). AR ChIP was performed in paired ethanol-treated
and R1881-treated samples. ChIP-enriched chromatin as well as the whole-cell extract was
amplified by ligation-mediated PCR. When examining AR binding on target genomic regions,
equal amount of ethanol-treated and R1881-treated ChIP amplicons were subjected to QPCR
and the fold enrichment (R1881/ethanol) was determined based on the cycle differences after
normalization to input DNA. For ERG ChIP assays, VCaP cells grown in regular medium were
used for ChIP using antibodies against ERG and rabbit IgG control. ChIP products were directly
analyzed by QPCR assay and ERG binding was evaluated based on the cycle difference
between ChIP-enriched chromatin by ERG and corresponding IgG. The primers used are listed
in Supplemental Table 9.
ChIP-Seq

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

ChIP samples were prepared for sequencing using the Genomic DNA sample prep kit following
manufacturers protocols. ChIP-Sequencing was performed using Illumina Genome Analyzer
according to standard manufacturer’s procedures. The raw sequencing image data were
analyzed by our analysis pipeline, aligned to the unmasked human reference genome (NCBI
v36, hg18) using ELAND software to generate sequence reads of 25–32 bps.
Digital gene expression analysis
Trizol extracted RNA from samples with 0h and 48h androgen treatment were prepared for
sequencing using the Digital Gene Expression-Tag Profiling with NIaIII kit (Illumina) and
sequenced by the Genome Analyzer. Sequencing reads were mapped back to the human
reference genome using the ELAND software. The number of sequencing reads for genes of
interest was counted. The expression level of each gene was measured as the number of
transcripts per million of total sequencing reads.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Q-PCR was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix on an Applied Biosystems 7300 PCR
machine as previously described 19. All primers were designed using Primer 3 and synthesized
by Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in Supplementary Table 9.

RNA interference
DU145 or RWPE cells were treated with non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon) and gene-specific
siRNA sequences as listed in Supplementary Table 10.

Cell invasion assays were carried out using a modified basement membrane chamber assay as
previously described19.
Cell motility assay
For cell motility assays, we used the Cellomics Cell Motility kit as per manufacturer’s

Figure 1. Metabolomic profiling of prostate cancer

a, Venn diagram of the total metabolites detected across 42 prostate-related tissues and 110
matched plasma and urine samples. b, Venn diagram of 626 metabolites in tissues measured
across 16 benign adjacent prostate, 12 clinically localized prostate cancers (PCA), and 14
metastatic prostate cancers (Mets). c, Heat map representation of unsupervised hierarchical
clustering of b (rows) grouped by sample type (columns). Shades of yellow and blue represent
elevation and decrease of a metabolite respectively relative to the median metabolite levels
(see color scale). d, Z-score plots for b normalized to the mean of the benign prostate samples
(truncated at 25 SD for clarity, see Supplementary Methods for procedural details).

Figure 2. Metabolomic alterations of prostate cancer progression

a, Heat map showing 87 differential metabolites in PCA relative to benign samples (Wilcoxon
P ≤ 0.05). Localized PCA samples are grouped as i., low grade (Gleason<6) and ii., high grade
(Gleason>=7). Metastatic samples are grouped by the site of tissue procurement namely iii.,
soft tissue, iv., rib/diaphragm or v., liver. b, Benign-based z-score plot of named metabolites
from a. Each point represents one metabolite in one sample, colored by tissue type
(jade=benign, yellow=PCA). c, As in b except for the comparison between Mets (red) and
PCA (yellow), with data represented relative to the mean of the PCA samples. For clarity, the
plots in b and c have been truncated at 15 standard deviations above the mean of the benign
and PCA samples, respectively.
