ABSTRACT:
Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Both histologically
and molecularly lung cancer is heterogeneous. This review summarizes the current
knowledge of the pathways involved in the various types of lung cancer with an
emphasis on the clinical implications of the increasing number of actionable molecular
targets. It describes the major pathways and molecular alterations implicated in the
development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma and
squamous cancer), and of small cell carcinoma, emphasizing the molecular alterations
comprising the specific blueprints in each group. The approved and investigational
targeted therapies as well as the immune therapies, and clinical trials exploring the
variety of targeted approaches to treatment of lung cancer are the main focus of this
review.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death
worldwide. Approximately 80% of lung cancers are
grouped as non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC),
which are clinically and pathologically different from
small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Adenocarcinoma
(AC) of lung comprises about 40% to 50% of all lung
cancers. AC is the most common subtype of NSCLC,
the group that also includes squamous cell carcinoma
(SQCC) and large cell carcinoma (LCLC). Recently,
genomic-based classification of LCLC eliminated this
subtype, demonstrating that it can be molecularly subclassified as either adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine
tumor [1]. The discovery of recurrent mutations in EGFR

and fusions involving ALK and other receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs), and development of targeted therapies,
have transformed the standard of treatment of patients
with AC. Molecular genotyping of AC now routinely
includes testing the status of EGFR and ALK, which are
altered in about 25% of AC patients, and for which there
are approved targeted therapies. Patients with alterations
in EGFR and ALK respond better to targeted inhibitors
than to conventional chemotherapy.
SQCC tumors rarely have mutations in EGFR or
ALK fusions, instead harboring alterations in other RTKs –
mutations in DDR2 and amplifications/mutations of FGFR
(fibroblast growth factor receptor) family, both of which
are therapeutic targets. Analysis of signaling pathways
involved in pathogenesis and large-scale genomic analyses
of SQCC reveal it to be a distinct clinicopathological type
of NSCLC, even though some somatogenic alterations
are shared with AC (Tables 1 and 2). SCLC, however, is
an entirely distinct type of lung cancer, originating in a
different cellular compartment of lung tissue, and with its
own distinct molecular pathogenesis as well as pathology
and clinical course.
In spite of advances in targeting signaling pathways
in NSCLC, the most prevalent mutations found in lung
cancer are those within the tumor suppressor TP53,
which are currently untargetable. ACs often contain lossof-function mutations in other tumor suppressor genes
– the most prominent, in addition to TP53, being loss of
function of LKB1/STK11, NF1, CDKN2A, SMARCA4,
and KEAP1. SQCC tumors have a different and partially
overlapping with AC spectrum of inactivated tumor
suppressors: TP53 in a majority of tumors and inactivation
of any of the following: CDKN2A, PTEN, KEAP1,
MLL2, HLA-A, NFE2L2, NOTCH1 and RB1. These are
challenging therapeutic targets, even though strategies
for indirect targeting, i.e., involving proteins activated in
the pathways governed by tumor suppressors, are being
developed.
A number of targets other than EGFR and ALK are
explored in clinical and preclinical development, and most
of them are altered in AC in a gain-of-function manner,
i.e., increase in enzymatic activity that could be targeted.
Among these targets are KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PI3KC
and translocations involving RET and ROS, as well
as RTK MET, which is activated mainly in tumors that
develop resistance to targeted therapies.
A large study employing next generation sequencing
(NGS) to identify mutations and other alterations in AC
was conducted in 2012, sequencing exomes or genomes
of 183 ACs [2]. The mean exomic somatic mutation rate
in this study was 12 per megabase, but there were large
differences in numbers of mutations observed in tumors
from non-smokers versus smokers: mean 2.9/Mb versus
12.9/Mb. In an earlier smaller study the difference was
reported to be 10-fold [3]. The authors [2] noted that a
significant number of driver mutations grouped with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

epigenetic or RNA deregulation, which has not been
recognized in the pre-genomics era. These are interesting
observations regarding the pathogenesis of AC but it is
possible that they could be explained in part by the failure
to identify all driver mutations.
A large NGS analysis of SQCC (178 tumors)
performed by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network
identified a mean of 360 exomic mutations, 323 altered
copy number segments and 165 genomic rearrangements
per tumor. The mean somatic mutation rate of 8.1
mutations per megabase observed in this study of SQCC
was higher than that previously reported for a number
of other types of cancer. The spectrum of somatic copy
number alteration in SQCC was in general similar to AC
with a notable exception of selective amplification of a
region on chromosome 3q. The evidence of unique clinical
and pathological character of SQCC was confirmed
in this study [4] that identified SOX2 amplification,
NFE2L2 and KEAP1 mutations, PI3K pathway changes,
FGFR1 amplification, and DDR2 mutations that are not
encountered or are relatively rare in AC.
Small cell lung cancer is almost exclusively
associated with smoking, with about 90% of patients
being smokers or former smokers. SCLC patients with
extensive have a poor prognosis, even though the initial
response to chemotherapy could be positive. Relapse
usually occurs within months, and the recurrent disease
is almost invariably lethal. Integrative genome analysis
of 29 SCLC tumors [5] has determined an extremely
high mutation rate of 7.4 protein-changing mutations
per megabase. It also confirmed that all SCLC tumors
have inactivated TP53 and RB pathways and recurrent
amplifications of MYC genes, known to be a hallmark of
SCLC prior to the evolution of NGS methodologies. In
addition, the study found recurrent mutations in histone
modifiers CREBBP, EP300, and MLL. Involvement
of signaling pathways in SCLC is more limited than in
other lung cancer types, with 6% of tumors carrying
amplified FGFR1, and PTEN inactivation occurring in
some tumors. Profound disregulation of cell cycle control
involving the already mentioned alterations in TP53 and
in RB1 and MYC genes is a ubiquitous feature of SCLC.
Disregulation of the developmental pathways was noted
in about 10% of tumors through mutations in SLIT2 and
EPHA7. Proteomic profiling identified EZH2 and PARP-1
as activated and highly expressed proteins in SCLC [6].
This paper will review alterations in a number
of cellular pathways involved in pathogenesis of lung
cancer, emphasizing those that contain actionable targets,
and providing information on clinical testing of relevant
investigational drugs. Table 1 lists pathways and genes
products known to be involved in three major types of lung
cancer, and Table 2 contains a more detailed description of
gene products and frequency of their alterations as well
as potential drugs. It is obvious from Table 1 that RTK
signal transduction pathways are predominantly affected
1393

in AC, and much less so in SQCC and particularly in
SCLC, while the PI3K pathway is deregulated in more
than half of SQCC. SCLC is distinguished by universal
disruption of both TP53 and RB1 pathways, even though,
as mentioned, TP53 itself is the most frequently mutated
gene in all types of lung cancer. Interestingly, epigenetic
deregulation is observed in all three types with similar
frequency but involves different sets of genes that are
mutated. Developmental or differentiation pathways
are involved most prominently in SQCC and only one
developmental gene is affected by recurrent mutations in
AC.

in AC has become a routine diagnostic procedure, in
line with NCCN guidelines, because treatment of EGFR
mutant and ALK-positive AC with FDA-approved targeted
drugs produces better responses than chemotherapy
regimens.

EGFR
EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to
epidermal growth factor and other growth factor ligands
to become activated. Upon activation, EGFR tyrosine
kinase activates downstream pathways including MAPK
and PI3K, leading to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.
Activation of EGFR has other pleiotropic effects, among
them contributing to immune escape of tumors [7] and to
suppression of autophagy [8], both with serious clinical
implications for immunotherapy approaches and the
currently explored therapeutic induction of autophagy,
respectively.
EGFR is implicated in a variety of cancers and
frequently mutated in AC. EGFR alterations occur in
~10% of western and ~50% of Asian patients with lung

RTKs are involved in different types of lung cancer
at different frequencies, but have attracted a lot of interest
because there are targeted therapies for activated RTKs
approved or fairly advanced in clinical development.

AC. Higher EGFR mutation frequency is observed in nonsmokers, women, and in non-mucinous tumors. EGFR
has been shown to be deregulated by various mechanisms
in AC, including overexpression, amplification, and
mutation. Overexpression of EGFR occurs in up to 60%
of NSCLC, with higher frequency in AC versus SQCC
(reviewed in [9, 10]).
Several types of activating mutations are known to
occur in EGFR in NSCLC: Class I - exon 19 in-frame
deletions (44% of all EGFR mutations), Class II - single
amino acid changes (L858R 41%, G719 4%, other
missense mutations 6%), Class III - exon 20 in-frame
duplication/insertions (5%). These mutations occur in the
tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR. Eighty-five percent
of all EGFR-activating mutations are exon 19 in-frame
deletions or L858R, and they tend to be sensitive to
currently approved EGFR inhibitors (reviewed in [11]).
Class III mutations (exon 20) are generally insensitive to
EGFR inhibitors with exception of A763_Y764insFQEA
[12].
Patients with AC and “large cell” histology NSCLC
should be tested at diagnosis for EGFR mutations, as
those who exhibit such mutations benefit from EGFR
inhibitors (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib) in the firstline setting. Data from several clinical trials have indicated
that patients with EGFR mutations have improved
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
when treated with EGFR inhibitors compared to patients
with the same mutations who received standard-of-care,
cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens [13-15].

Icotinib is another EGFR inhibitor clinically
developed in China and reportedly active against mutant
and wild-type forms of the receptor. A phase 3 randomized
trial of icotinib versus gefitinib showed the non-inferiority
of icotinib and a much better profile in terms of drugrelated side effects [19].
Second-generation EGFR inhibitors that bind
to EGFR or other receptors in the EGFR family in an
irreversible manner are in clinical testing (reviewed
in [20]). BIBW2992/Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB
family blocker that covalently binds to the cysteine
residue of EGFR (as well as HER2), providing longer
inhibition of EGFR (reviewed in [21]). Afatinib showed
objective responses in 60% of molecularly selected
patients in a phase 2 study, LUX-Lung 3 [22]. Afatinib
has also demonstrated a small benefit in those previously
treated with other EGFR TKIs [23]. In a decisive large
randomized trial, afatinib in a preselected EGFRmutant population was compared to the state-of-the-art
chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin, and was
shown to be superior [24]. Afatinib is undergoing clinical
testing as single therapy or in combination treatments
in at least 20 trials (for example, NCT01542437,
NCT01466660). In July 2013 afatinib (Gilotrif) was
approved as the first-line treatment for advanced stage
NSCLC with class I and class II EGFR mutations.
Dacomitinib (PF-00299804), a pan-EGFR-family
irreversible inhibitor is currently in several trials for
NSCLC, such as phase 2trial NCT01858389 for advanced
NSCLC, phase 3 NCT01360554 comparing dacomitinib
and erlotinib, phase 3 NCT01774721/ARCHER 1050
comparing dacomitinib versus gefitinib, phase 3
NCT01000025 for patients with advanced NSCLC who
have not responded to previous therapies, and several
more. In a recent trial, treatment with dacomitinib was
associated with a median PFS of 12.4 weeks compared
with 8.3 weeks for erlotinib in patients with AC. However,
a superior PFS with dacomitinib compared to erlotinib
was not observed in other histological subtypes of
NSCLC [25]. All the aforementioned EGFR inhibitors
are anilinoquinazolines and engage both the mutant and
wild type receptors. Thus this class of drugs share the
common side effects of rash and diarrhea which arises by
the binding of the EGFR receptors in the skin and gastrointestinal tract respectively.
Other EGFR inhibitors are in various stages of
development. Some of these are pyrimidines and engage
only the mutant receptor. Therefore this class of drugs
lack the troublesome rash and diarrhea seen with the
aniliquinazolines. CO-1686 is an irreversible inhibitor
of EGFR active in the presence of T790M patients, and
is now in an early clinical trial involving a selected,
pretreated patient population with the T790M mutation
that confers resistance to first-generation inhibitors
(NCT01526928). AP26113, a dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor
that appears to overcome RTK-mutation-based resistance,

Potential therapeutic approaches for EGFRmutant AC
EGFR inhibitors. Table 3 lists many of the
EGFR inhibitors as well as other targeted drugs
under development for treatment of NSCLC, and a
comprehensive list of targeted therapies for NSCLC is
regularly updated and published [16]. FDA-approved
EGFR inhibitors include erlotinib (Tarceva), gefitinib
(Iressa) and afatinib (Gilotrif). A randomized trial in
Japan showed a significantly prolonged PFS in patients
on gefitinib versus standard chemotherapy [17]. This trial
was the first randomized study to demonstrate benefit
of an oral targeted therapy versus chemotherapy in a
molecularly selected population with NSCLC. However,
FDA withdrew approval for use of gefitinib in new patients
due to lack of evidence that it extends life. In May 2013
FDA approved a companion diagnostic test for erlotinib
(Cobas) that detects exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R
substitutions. These mutations are found in patients that
are selectively good responders to erlotinib therapy. In a
pivotal trial of erlotinib versus chemotherapy, PFS of 13.1
months was seen with erlotinib treatment, compared to
4.6 months for those who received a standard two-drug
chemotherapy regimen [18].

has entered clinical testing NCT01449461. The trial
recruits patients with ALK translocation and those
previously treated with EGFR inhibitors that developed
T790M mutation.
Inherent lack of response to EGFR inhibitors is
not well understood, but presence of mutations in KRAS
(codon 13) was predictive for poor response to erlotinib
compared to mutant codon 12 [26]. However, KRAS and
EGFR mutations are almost always mutually exclusive,
and the lack of response to EGFR TKIs is most likely
due to the absence of an EGFR mutation as opposed to
the existence of a KRAS mutation. Some mutations in
EGFR, such as insertions in exon 20 [27] and T790M
(rarely found in untreated AC) confer primary resistance
to EGFR.
Antibodies. Cetuximab (Erbitux), a chimeric
monoclonal IgG1 antibody that blocks EGFR signaling,
has been investigated in the front line in combination
with platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced
NSCLC through two multicenter, randomized phase
3 trials. Necitumumab and nimozutumab, other antiEGFR antibodies, have also been investigated in several
clinical trials, mostly in combination with chemotherapy
regimens. A randomized phase 3 trial (SQUIRE)
comparing chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) with
necitumumab versus chemotherapy alone demonstrated a
significantly increased overall survival (OS) in patients
with metastatic stage 4 SQCC (Eli Lilly press release, Aug
2013).
Combination Therapies. Over 100 clinical trials
for recurrent or advanced NSCLC involve erlotinib
in combination with other therapies. Results of a trial
using combination of erlotinib and tivantinib/ARQ
197, a non-ATP-competitive inhibitor of MET, showed
clinical activity in patients with NSCLC, with 6 of 8
patients achieving stable disease [28]. One study explored
combination of erlotinib with HDAC inhibitor entinostat
in patients with advanced NSCLC that had progressed
after chemotherapy. Although the combination regimen
did not demonstrate a significant survival advantage in the
overall population, it showed a synergistic effect in the
subset of patients with high E-cadherin expression [29]. A
phase 1 study of the combination of erlotinib, cetuximab,
and bevacizumab was well-tolerated and demonstrated
antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with
NSCLC [30]. A meta-analysis of results of studies of
erlotinib alone versus combination targeted therapies
concluded that the latter are superior over erlotinib
monotherapy as second-line treatment for advanced
NSCLC [31].
A phase 3 randomized trial explored addition of
erlotinib to the doublet chemotherapy with cisplatin/
gemcitabine as a - treatment in patients with advanced
NSCLC. Addition of erlotinib significantly prolonged PFS
in patients with mutant EGFR [32]. Addition of afatinib to
the same regimen of chemotherapy in a randomized phase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

3 trial had a strong positive effect on PFS [24].
There are a number of other trials evaluating the
efficacy of combining first- or second-generation EGFR
inhibitors with other molecularly targeted agents. Some
of ongoing combination therapy trials with erlotinib are:
NCT01294306 - erlotinib and AKT inhibitor MK2206;
NCT01859026 - erlotinib and MEK inhibitor MEK162,
in EGFR and KRAS mutant NSCLC; NCT00994123
– erlotinib and MM-121, an anti-ERBB3 antibody (see
below, under ERBB3 section), NCT01454102 – erlotinib
and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), NCT00966472 erlotinib with Rosurastatin, NCT01186861 - erlotinib
and linsitinib/OSI-906 (IGF1R inhibitor); NCT01708954
- erlotinib with Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237;
NCT01471964 – erlotinib and mTOR ihnibitor CC-223.
Afatinib is currently being evaluated in combination with
nimozutumab (anti-EGFR antibody) in NCT01861223,
with cetuximab (anti-EGFR antibody) in NCT01090011,
with the HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 in NCT01259089,
and with sirolimus/rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) in
NCT00993499.
As already mentioned above, anti-EGFR antibodies
are also analyzed in combination trials. For example,
NCT01451632 examines the effects of cetuximab with
MM-121 (anti-ERBB3 antibody) and chemotherapeutic
agent irinotecan. Necitumumab is also currently
being investigated in six trials involving combination
chemotherapy.

Resistance to EGFR inhibitors
As noted, EGFR inhibitors have a significantly better
effect on PFS compared with conventional chemotherapy
[33]. However, nearly all patients with EGFR-mutantAC develop resistance to the first-generation inhibitors
erlotinib and gefitinib, with a median PFS of 14 months
[34]. Several mechanisms have been implicated in
resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and they were reviewed
recently [35-37].
The most common mechanism of acquired resistance
to erlotinib or gefitinib is emergence of the “gatekeeper”
mutation in EGFR itself, which likely indicates the
“addiction” of lung cancer to EGFR signaling. A single
amino acid change, T790M in exon 20 of the EGFR gene,
is found in about 50% to 60% of patients developing
resistance [38]. EGFR TKIs (such as erlotinib or gefitinib)
are selective inhibitors of EGFR’s kinase domain, that
work by competing with ATP at the ATP-binding site,
thereby preventing autophosphorylation and activation.
The T790M mutation affects the gatekeeper residue in
the catalytic-kinase domain and confers drug resistance
by increasing EGFR’s affinity for ATP – thus reducing the
potency of the ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors [39].
Interestingly, the development of a T790M mutation may
actually confer a relatively improved survival, as tumors
that acquire it appear to be less aggressive than tumors
1397

Oncotarget

with EGFR TKI resistance due to other mechanisms [40].
The other common mechanism of acquired
resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition involves
amplification of RTK c-MET [41], a proto-oncogene that
encodes a protein also known as hepatocyte growth factor
receptor (HGFR),. Interestingly, a subpopulation of cells
with amplified MET might preexist in tumors – i.e., MET
amplification occurs in limited areas prior to treatment
with EGFR inhibitors [42]. This might be due to increased
levels of HGF that apparently accelerate development of
MET amplification in vitro and in vivo [42]. Activation
of MET promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition or
EMT [43].
EMT has been heavily implicated in the resistance
of NSCLC to EGFR inhibitors and could involve
upregulation of another RTK AXL. AXL drives a
mesenchymal phenotype, and resulting tumors acquire
sensitivity to AXL inhibitor SGI-7079 [44]. IGFR-1 could
also promote EMT in tumors with EGFR mutations, and
this involves TGFα-1 signaling rather than MET or AXL
hyperactivaiton [45].
In addition to EMT, PIK3CA mutations, and
conversion to small cell lung cancer histology are other
mechanisms that have been implicated in resistance to
EGFR inhibition [46]. Serial biopsies revealed that these
genetic mechanisms of resistance were lost in the absence
of the continued selective pressure of EGFR inhibitor
treatment, and such cancers were sensitive to a second
round of treatment with EGFR inhibitors [46].
Another mechanism of resistance is amplification of
HER2 reported to occur in 12% of tumors that developed
resistance to EGFR inhibitors [47]. HER2 amplification
and EGFR (T790M) were mutually exclusive in this
setting. Afatinib (second-generation EGFR inhibitor) and
cetuximab (anti-EGFR antibody) significantly inhibit
HER2 phosphorylation in vitro, suggesting that tumors
acquiring resistance to erlotinib should be tested for
HER2 status and potentially treated with a pan-EGFR TKI
inhibitor such as afatinib [47].
An extensive study examined potential involvement
of mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, and MEK1 in a
large number of resistant tumors, and found no evidence
of secondary mutations in these genes with the exception
of BRAF, where mutations were identified in 2 of 195
(1%) biopsies [48]. However, reduced expression of the
negative regulator of RAS proteins, NF1, was implicated
in both intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR
inhibitors that could be rescued with MEK1 inhibitor [49].
Preclinical studies with NSCLC cells selected in
vitro for resistance to EGFR inhibitions indicated other
potential mechanisms of acquired resistance, such as
increased expression of FGF2 and FGFR1, in an autocrine
bypass loop [50].Another study has identified an acquired
amplification of the adaptor protein CRKL (that has
known oncogenic properties) in an NSCLC patient that
developed resistance to erlotinib [51].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Deubiquitinating
enzymes
that
prevent
ubiquitination-triggered degradation of RTKs could
become a new target in forestalling resistance to RTK
inhibitors. Silencing or pharmacological inhibition of
USP8 deubiquitinase, relevant in particular to the stability
of RTKs such as EGFR and MET, was shown to induce
death of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells in vitro and in
vivo [52].
17-DMAG (Hsp90 inhibitor) and belinostat
(histone deacetylase inhibitor) alone and particularly in
combination were shown to be efficacious in a setting of
resistance to EGFR inhibitors conferred by mutations in
EGFR or PTEN [53]. These pathways already are and will
be further interrogated in clinical trials.

Addressing drug resistance in EGFR mutant
NSCLC
Second Generation EGFR Inhibitors. The secondgeneration TKIs such as afatinib (BIBW2992) described
above irreversibly inhibit RTKs of EGFR family, as well
as the T790M variant of EGFR [21, 54]. As mentioned
above, afatinib has been evaluated in the LUX-Lung trials,
with improvement in PFS reported in patients with EGFRactivating mutations, as both the first- and second/thirdline therapies compared to chemotherapy. But some other
results indicate limited activity of the second generation of
EGFR inhibitors in the setting of T790 mutation [55, 56].
The novel inhibitor CO-1686 showed promising
results in NSCLC patients with the T790M EGFR
mutation that were previously treated with the first-line
EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib or gefitinib) (NCT01526928).
Resistance to CO-1686 was observed in vitro and could
be overcome with an inhibitor of AKT [57]. AP26113, a
dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor that also appears to overcome
T790M-mutation-based resistance, has entered clinical
testing (NCT01449461) in patients with acquired T790M.
AZD9291 is another new inhibitor of EGFR including
T790M variant in clinical development (NCT01802632)
and has already produced partial responses in patients
that progressed on other EGFR inhibitors (15th World
Conference on Lung Cancer, 2013).
Some evidence indicates that targeting other RTKs
of the EGFR family in combination with EGFR inhibitors
might be efficient in preventing development of resistance
[58]. Clinical trials addressing this possibility are listed
above, in “Combination Treatments.” In particular,
targeting ERBB3 is of clinical interest due to its ability to
strongly activate PI3K signaling.
MET inhibitors. Various drugs or antibodies capable
of inhibiting MET (e.g., crizotinib, foretinib, ARQ 197,
MetMAb) could, in principle, be combined with the
first (erlotinib) or second (Dacomitinib/PF-00299804,
afatinib/ BIBW2992) generation EGFR-TKIs. Concurrent
inhibition of both may improve patient outcomes. Small1398

EGFR inhibitors in tumors with wild-type EGFR

molecule inhibitors of MET and MetMAb/Onartuzumab
are currently being tested in NSCLC (see MET section).
However, the phase III trial of Onartuzumab combined
with erlotinib in MET positive EGFR mutant NSCLC
failed to improve PFS or OS in spite of the positive results
from a phase II trial [59].
Hsp90 inhibitors. HSP90 is a molecular chaperone
that is critical for tumor growth and proliferation. Many
cancers have increased levels of active Hsp90, which is
involved in protein folding. Client proteins of HSP90
include many signaling kinases such as RTKs and
intracellular kinases essential for cancer cell survival,
since lack of HSP90 triggers protein degradation. Hsp90
inhibitors may thus block multiple signaling pathways
that are functioning aberrantly in cancer cells. Hsp90
inhibitors such as AUY922 and ganetespib (STA9090)
are in many clinical trials for lung cancer. Both inhibitors
showed good efficacy in preclinical models of NSCLC
[60-62]. Ganetespib monotherapy showed clinical activity
in heavily pretreated patients with advanced NSCLCs,
particularly in patients with tumors harboring ALK gene
rearrangement [63] (see “ALK” section). AUY922
is currently being evaluated in five trials for NSCLC.
NCT01784640, for example, addresses specifically
efficacy of AUY922 with pemetrexed in previously
treated Stage IV patients. However, HSP90 inhibitors are
expected to work best in combination with other drugs,
and a randomized phase 2trial of ganetispib with docetaxel
showed a significant improvement in overall survival in
stage 4 patients (ASCO meeting 2013). A different type
of inhibitor, OGX-427, an antisense oligonucleotide to
HSP90, is currently in clinical testing in combination with
chemotherapy (NCT01829113).
Combination therapies. A number of trials examining
combination treatments to forestall or overcome resistance
to EGFR inhibitors were described above. Ongoing trials
for recurrent or advanced NSCLC will test the efficacy of
various combination therapies including EGFR inhibitors,
second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dual MET/
VEGFR2 inhibitor, and targeted drugs to different proteins
disregulated in lung cancer. For example, docetaxel with

antibody cetuximab in the setting of acquired resistance to
erlotinib or gefitinib (NCT01090011).

Identification of patients with wild-type EGFR
tumors who may benefit from treatment with an EGFR
inhibitor is a clinically important question. The two firstgeneration EGFR inhibitors differ in their selectivity
towards tumors with wild-type EGFR. Erlotinib has
demonstrated activity in pre-treated patients with EGFR
wild-type tumors [64], with modest improvement in
survival outcomes as switch-maintenance therapy [65].
In contrast, gefitinib has only demonstrated activity in
patients with activating mutations in EGFR. Dacomitinib
showed a superior PFS to erlotinib in patients with wildtype (and mutant) EGFR [25].
An approved test known as VeriStrat provides
likely responsiveness to EGFR inhibitory therapies in
the absence of EGFR mutations. VeriStrat utilizes mass
spectrometry to evaluate tumor EGFR ligand levels
and predict patient response and survival outcome to
erlotinib and other EGFR inhibitors from serum samples
[66]. Several recent studies have indicated that VeriStrat
classification has significant power to predict response to
EGFR inhibitors for several cancer types [67, 68] . The
“VeriStrat good” patients had increased survival after
erlotinib treatment compared to the “VeriStrat poor” group
[69]. A later study found that VeriStrat has a prognostic
role in patients with advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC
treated with erlotinib and bevacizumab in the first line
[70].
However, the use of RTK inhibitors in wild-type
EGFR NSCLC patients remains a subject of controversy,
with some investigators advocating it [71, 72], while
others provide data analysis indicating no benefit in this
large heterogeneous population of patients [73]. A large
randomized trial has showed the superior efficacy of
docetaxel over erlotinib in wild-type EGFR patients [74].
It appears that grouping together EGFR wild-type NSCLC
as a category is misleading, and should be replaced by
further molecular analysis of these tumors with a goal of
identifying the clinically important genetic alterations.
Indeed, the current (2013) ASCO guidelines state: “in
unselected patients, evidence is insufficient to recommend
single-agent erlotinib or gefitinib as first-line therapy… if
EGFR mutation status is negative or unknown, cytotoxic
chemotherapy is preferred.”

EML4-ALK
The EML4-ALK oncogene is a fusion between
echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)
and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) [75]. The fusion
generates an overexpressed and activated tyrosine kinase,
whereas normal lung tissue does not express ALK.
EML4-ALK fusions are found in about 3% to13 % of
NSCLC patients [76], and are largely mutually exclusive
1399

with alterations in other RTKs or KRAS based on analysis
of almost 1700 tumors [77]. Patients with EML4-ALK
mutant tumors are characteristically younger, and like
patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, they typically are
never smokers with AC histology [78].
EML4-ALK oncogene does not involve either PI3K
or MAPK pathways in its transforming activity, which
suggests lack of utility of inhibitors of these pathways
in treating patients with the ALK fusions. However,
inhibition of molecular chaperone HSP90 leads to
degradation of EML4-ALK and a rapid, but transient,
regression of tumor growth in a mouse model [79].

The Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib, in a preclinical
study conducted in vitro and in animals, induced loss
of EML4-ALK expression and depletion of multiple
oncogenic signaling proteins in ALK-driven NSCLC
cells [82]. Ganetispib had a greater in vitro potency and
better antitumor efficacy compared to crizotinib [82].
Ganetespib (STA-9090) is being tested in clinical trials for
ALK-positive lung cancer patients, alone (NCT01562015)
or in combination with crizotinib (NCT01579994). A
completed phase 2 trial of ganetespib showed clinical
activity in heavily pretreated patients with advanced
NSCLCs, particularly in patients with tumors positive
for EML4-ALK [63]. In preclinical models, Ganetispib
was shown to be not only effective in ALK positive
adenocarcinoma, but was able to overcome resistance to
crizotinib [82]. Another HSP90 inhibitor, AUY-922 is
also in clinical trial for advanced ALK-positive patients
(NCT01752400). NCT01772797 examines the safety
of LDK378 in combination with AUY-922. Phase I/II
clinical trial NCT01712217 will explore HSP90 inhibitor
AT13387 alone or in combination with crizotinib.

Potential therapeutic approaches for EML4-ALK
ALK inhibitors. Crizotinib (Xalkori) was approved
by the FDA for ALK-positive NSCLC in 2011. A large
phase 3 trial has demonstrated the superiority to standard
chemotherapy in patients with previously treated
advanced NSCLC with ALK rearrangement [80]. A new
inhibitor, LDK378, is in development, having received
the FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in March
2013. This program, introduced in the summer of 2012,
is intended to expedite the development and review of
drugs that treat serious and life-threatening conditions
and that have demonstrated substantial improvement over
existing therapies on at least one clinically significant
endpoint. This designation for LDK378 was based on
phase 1 trial results data that showed marked responses
in a majority of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. An
overall response rate of 80% was observed in the patients
whose tumor progressed on crizotinib treatment. LDK378
is currently being tested in a number of clinical trials,
including NCT01685060, NCT01685138, NCT01283516,
NCT01634763, NCT01828112, NCT01828099, and
expanded treatment protocol trial NCT01947608 –
both for patients previously treated with crizotinib
and for treatment-naïve patients. Four more trials will
start recruiting patients soon. There are several other
ALK inhibitors currently evaluated in clinical trials,
including X-396 that is being tested in the phase 1 trial
NCT01625234. RO5424802/Alectinib is tested in phase
1/2 trial (NCT01588028) for ALK rearranged tumors, and
in a phase 2 trial NCT01801111 for patients who failed
on crizotinib. Preliminary results showing excellent
activity were reported from a clinical trial in Japan [81],
and RO5424802 received the Breakthrough Therapy
designation in October 2013. AP26113, an ALK inhibitor
from Ariad, was reported to show efficacy based on
preliminary results of trial NCT01449461. The drug was
effective in patients previously treated with crizotinib, in
patients with brain metastases and, interestingly, in EGFRmutant patients including T790M.

Resistance to crizotinib
Patients treated with crizotinib usually develop
resistance to it, and the mechanisms of this appear to
be heterogeneous. Several patterns were described:
secondary (gatekeeper) mutations in ALK that render
the kinase resistant to crizotinib; increased ALK copy
number, EGFR L858R mutation and high levels of
amphiregulin in sera of resistant patients [83]. Another
study of resistance to crizotinib also identified secondary
mutations in ALK, in EGFR, and in KRAS [84]. Although
crizotinib was ineffectual against EML4-ALK harboring
the gatekeeper mutation, two structurally different ALK
inhibitors, NVP-TAE684 and AP26113, were highly active
against the resistant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [85].
As mentioned above, RO5424802 is in clinical trial for
patients who have failed crizotinib. A new ALK inhibitor
in preclinical development, PF-06463922, showed activity
in crizotinib-resistant tumors in mouse models, and was
able to cross blood-brain barrier. It is about to enter
clinical testing (NCT01970865).

MET
MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor)
RTK, also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor
HGFR, is a proto-oncogene with important implications
in NSCLC [86]. MET activation induces specific
phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues, which, in
turn, activates multiple downstream signaling pathways,
1400

Oncotarget

including RAS/MAPK, PI3K, and SRC kinase pathways
(reviewed in [87]). MET promotes epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), at least in part through activation of
SRC. Elevated levels of HGF and intratumoral MET
expression have been associated with a more aggressive
biology and a worse prognosis in NSCLC. Disregulation
of MET pathway leads to cell proliferation, cell survival,
angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.
MET disregulation can occur through a variety of
mechanisms including c-MET overexpression, activation,
gene amplification, and overexpression of the c-MET
ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Tests for the
detection of these abnormalities are not FDA approved,
nor is c-MET considered a predictive marker that informs
clinical decision making.
MET mutations have been observed in about 5% of
treatment-naive NSCLC [88], mainly within exons 2 and
14, outside of the kinase domain. Mutations in MET are
observed more often in smokers [89]. The MET mutation
N375S was detected as a germline mutation in a high
proportion of East Asian samples, and was correlated to
incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma [89].
MET amplification, as mentioned above, is one
of the mechanisms of the acquired resistance to EGFR
inhibitors and occurs in about 20% of treated patients
[90], but only in 1.4% of treatment-naïve patients [91],
exclusively in AC. A splice mutation in MET deleting the
juxtamembrane domain for binding the c-Cbl E3-ligase
was observed in 3.3% of patients [91]; normally such
binding leads to ubiquitination and receptor degradation,
and loss of this domain leads to MET activation.
MET overexpression has been observed in 25%
to 61% of NSCLC patients [92, 93]. The MET ligand
HGF is also expressed by tumor cells, with moderate
overexpression observed in a high proportion of lung
tumors [93, 94].

observed were stable disease [96]. Foretinib is tested
alone or in combination with erlotinib in NCT01068587.
Specific MET inhibitors EMD 1214063 and EMD
1204831 are in safety testing in various solid tumors.
Nonspecific inhibitor of MET MGCD265 is being tested
in combination with either erlotinib or docetaxel in a phase
1/2 trial NCT00975767 for NSCLC.
MET antibodies. A single-arm antibody directed
against the extracellular domain of MET, called MetMAb
(onartuzumab), has been tested in a randomized phase
2 trial comparing its combination with erlotinib versus
erlotinib alone as a second- or third-line treatment.
Patients whose tumors had high c-MET expression had
significantly longer PFS with MetMAb plus erlotinib
compared with erlotinib monotherapy, and significantly
longer OS (12.6 versus 4.6 months). In the cohort of
patients who received MetMAb, median OS was much
better for patients with high c-MET expression than for
those negative for c-MET (12.6 versus 5.5 months) [97].
Several clinical trials are evaluating MetMAb in different
settings of NSCLC, including a prospective, randomized
phase 3 study designed to validate the MetMAb findings
from the phase 2 study (NCT01456325), and a study in
SQCC comparing chemotherapy combination alone to
chemotherapy and MetMAb (NCT01519804).
HGF antibodies. Two anti-HGF antibodies were
tested in lung cancer patients. AMG-102 (rilotumumab) is
a human monoclonal antibody that showed some activity
in an early trial in patients with advanced solid tumors
[98]. AMG-102 is currently being tested in combination
with erlotinib (NCT01233687). A second HGF antibody
AV-299 was tested in phase 1 trial without promising
results. Based on this initial experience, there is currently
limited interest in clinical development of anti-HGF drugs.

ERBB2/HER2

Potential therapeutic approaches for MET

HER2 is a member of the EGFR/ERBB family of
RTKs, best known for its role in breast cancer, where
it is targeted by the antibody trastuzumab. HER2 is
unique in the EGFR family because it does not bind
any known ligands of the EGF family, but exists in an
unliganded, active confirmation. Its function is exerted via
heterodimerization with other family members. Mutations
in HER2 were identified in 2% to 4% of NSCLC examined
[99-101]. Most mutations occur in exon 20 affecting the
ATP-binding pocket. A recent study has confirmed the
previously reported higher rate of association of HER2
mutations with lung cancer in women and nonsmokers
[102]. Tumors with the HER2 mutation were mostly
adenocarcinomas, with the-HER2 mutation almost always
an exclusive driver [102]. Even though mutations are rare,
HER2 more frequently shows a moderately increased
copy number in AC, with different frequencies reported in
different studies [103-105], and around 10% in the large
NGS study [2].

MET inhibitors. Several targeted therapies for
the treatment of aberrant MET activity are currently in
clinical testing. MET inhibitor tivantinib (ARQ 197), in
combination with erlotinib in previously treated patients,
has shown better activity versus erlotinib alone in phase
2 study [95]. Response rate was higher in KRAS-mutant
NSCLC patients [95]. A randomized phase 3 study,
NCT01395758, was completed, and did not meet its
primary endpoint. However, further subset analysis is
currently being carried out. Tivantinib might have an offtarget activity.
Multi-RTK inhibitor Cabozantinib (XL184) is in
active or planned trials for NSCLC, as a single therapy
or with erlotinib (phase 2 trials NCT01866410 and
NCT01708954 for previously treated NSCLC). Foretinib,
a dual MET/VEGFR inhibitor, was in a dose escalation
study in various solid tumors, but the best responses

Potential therapeutic approaches for HER3

Mutations aside, ERBB2 was implicated in
resistance of NSCLC cell lines to EGFR-directed antibody
cetuximab in vitro. Activation of ERBB2 signaling
in cell lines through ERBB2 amplification or through
heregulin up-regulation resulted in persistent activation
of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and
cetuximab resistance [106].

Clinical studies of anti-ERBB3 antibody MM121 are ongoing in NCT00994123 and NCT01451632,
including combination study with erlotinib. NCT01451632
examines effects of MM-121 with cetuximab (anti-EGFR
antibody) and chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan.

Potential therapeutic approaches for HER2

ROS1

Thus far there has been limited clinical experience
with HER2 inhibitors in treatment of NSCLC, but a
number of trials are ongoing. Responses were observed
with trastuzumab and afatinib [102, 107] but not with
other EGFR-family-targeted drugs such as gefitinib or
lapatinib [108, 109]. Neratinib is a second-generation,
irreversible inhibitor of HER2 that is currently being
tested in NSCLC (NCT01827267). A dose-finding study
of neratinib combined with temsirolimus produced some
clinical responses in HER2 mutant NSCLC patients
[110]. MGHA22 is an anti-HER2 antibody with an
improved characteristic in the Fc domain that enables
enhanced binding of to the Fc-gamma receptor on
NK and macrophages for antibody-directed cell lysis.
MGHA22 is currently being trialed in NCT01148849
and NCT01195935. Trial NCT01526473 is testing a new
vaccine, HER2 VRP or AVX901, based on Venezuelan
equine encephalitis virus. An attenuated strain of VEEV,
in which 3 of the 7 viral genes were substituted with a
truncated HER2 gene to create a self-amplifying replicon
RNA, will be used to vaccinate patients with HER2expressing cancers.

ROS1 is a transmembrane proto-oncogene RTK of
the insulin-receptor family that is aberrantly expressed
in neoplasms of the central nervous system. ROS-1
translocations are observed in glioblastoma and other
tumors and, infrequently, in NSCLC, in about 1% to 2% of
patients (reviewed in [114]). Patients with ROS1-mutant
tumors are characteristically young nonsmokers. The
fusions of ROS with SLC34A2 and CD74 were identified
in a phosphoproteomic screen of tyrosine kinase activity in
lung cancer [115], and have been observed predominantly
in AC [116, 117]. ROS1 rearrangement defines a
molecular subset of NSCLC with clinical characteristics
that are similar to those observed in patients with ALKrearranged or EGFR-mutated NSCLC [117]. They are
mutually exclusive with EGFR, KRAS, and EML4-ALK
mutations.

Potential therapeutic approach for ROS1-positive
NSCLC
ROS1-positive NSCLC represents a unique subset
of patients for whom the c-MET/ALK inhibitor crizotinib
has shown potential as a very effective therapeutic
strategy. A phase 1 trial evaluating crizotinib in advanced
solid tumors that possess the ROS1 translocation is
currently ongoing (NCT00585195). The investigational
ALK inhibitor LDK378, fast-tracked by FDA, might
also have an inhibitory effect on ROS1, though it is not
presently investigated specifically in ROS1-positive
patients. AP26113 is a dual EGFR/ALK inhibitor in
clinical development (NCT01449461), and the ongoing
trial will recruit patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC
as well. ALK/ROS1 inhibitor PF-06463922 is in early
phase trial NCT01970865. An efficacy trial of HSP
inhibitor AUY922 is recruiting patients with various RTK
alterations including ROS1 fusion. Trial NCT01712217,
which explores crizotinib in combination with HSP90
inhibitor AT13387, is recruiting patients with both ALKand ROS1-positive NSCLC who have failed crizotinib. A
new ALK/ROS inhibitor PF-06463922 showed activity in
crizotinib-resistant tumors in mouse models and is about
to enter clinical testing (NCT01970865). Resistance
to crizotinib in a patient with CD74-ROS1 fusion was
already reported, apparently as a consequence of a de novo

ERBB3
This RTK of the EGFR family might be involved
in 2% of SQCC [4], though there is no direct evidence
of functional significance of these mutations yet. ERBB3
is unusual in that it lacks a kinase domain of its own,
but it heterodimerizes with other members of the EGFR
family, leading to potent activation of the PI3K pathway
(Schoeberl et al., 2009) and providing a strong rationale
for the inhibition of this RTK (reviewed in [111]). The
rationale for clinical development of anti-ERBB3 drugs in
combination with other EGFR family inhibitors is based
on the ability of EGFR family members to heterodimerize
with ERBB3, leading to activation of ligand-dependent
signaling [58]. Dual inhibition of ERBB3 and EGFR
shows synergistic effects in vitro in cell lines derived from
pelural effusion of lung adenocarcinoma patients [112].
Interestingly, while ERBB3 supports PI3K signaling in
epithelial cells, in vitro this leads to downregulation of
Erbb3 and rewiring of PI3K activation [113].

mutation of G2032R in the ROS1-kinase domain [118].
Preclinical studies showed that ROS1-positive cancer
cells, including the G2032R variant, are sensitive to MET/
VEGFR2 inhibitor foretinib, strongly suggesting that
foretinib could be the drug of choice for ROS1-positive
NSCLC [119].

FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) pathway
signaling normally contributes to the physiologic
processes of tissue repair, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis,
and embryonic development. Focal amplification of
FGFR1 was detected in 21% to 22% of SQCC tumors
according to two reports [127, 128], but is quite rare in
AC (1% to 3%) [2, 128]. Other members of the family
(FGFR2 and FGFR3) might be also activated in SQCC
at low frequencies of 2% to 3% [4]; mutations in these
receptors are oncogenic in vitro and in vivo, and are
sensitive to RTK inhibitor pazopanib [129]. FGFR1 is
the only RTK amplified at appreciable frequency (6%) in
SCLC [5].
SQCC tumors with amplified FGFR1 were found to
have high expression of MYC in 40% of cases, and this
subset is more sensitive to inhibition of FGFR, providing
a potential response-predictive biomarker [130].

RET
RET (rearranged during transfection) fusions
are considered to be driver mutations in lung cancer
because they are not found in association with changes
in EGFR, KRAS, ALK or HER2. RET rearrangements
are common (30%) in papillary thyroid carcinomas [120],
and mutations are found in 50% of medullary thyroid
carcinomas [121]. RET is an RTK involved in neural crest
development. RET ligands belong to the glial cell-derived
neurotrophic (GDNF) family, and upon engagement, RET
induces activation of multiple signaling pathways: PI3K,
MAPK, JNK, p38, SRC, ERK5, PLC-γ, and STAT [122].
The most common fusion partner of RET in NSCLC is
KIF5B, a gene in the family of motor proteins, kinesins
[117, 123, 124]. Other partners have been identified:
CCDC6 [117] and NCOA4 [125]. Translocations are
observed in a small percentage of patients (1% to 2%),
but stratification by smoking and age results in a higher
percentage of RET translocations. Patients with RET
translocations tend to be younger nonsmokers and have
poorly differentiated tumors [125].

Potential therapeutic options to FGFR alterations
FGFR inhibitors PD173074 and AZD4547 inhibit
proliferation of SQCC in vitro and tumor growth in vivo
[128, 131]. AZD4547 is under clinical investigation
in SQCC, including a phase 2 trial NCT01795768
in molecularly selected patients, a phase 1 trial
NCT00979134, and a phase 1/2 trial with docetaxel
for recurrent NSCLC and SQCC (NCT01824901).
BGJ 398 is a pan-FGFR inhibitor being investigated
in a dose-escalation (safety) trial (NCT01004224) for
FGFR-amplified malignancies. The multi-RTK and
SRC-family inhibitor BIBF 1120 (vargatef) is currently
being explored in Korean patients with small cell lung
cancer (SCLC) in NCT01441297. Dovitinib (TKI258)
is an inhibitor of FGFR3 and potentially other FGFRs,
which is currently being tested in patients with advanced
NSCLC or colorectal cancer (NCT01676714) and in
patients with SQCC (NCT01861197) and various tumors
phase 2 NCT01831726). Nintedanib is entering phase
2 studies in patients with FGFR1 amplified NSCLC
(NCT01948141). BAY1163877, a pan-FGFR inhibitor, is
entering a safety study in patients with FGFR-amplified
cancers (NCT01976741). GSK3052230, an antagonist
of FGFR receptors, is a fusion protein composed of the
extracellular domain of FGFR1 and the Fc portion of
IgG1. It is currently in a phase 1 study NCT01868022 as
a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in
SQCC patients with alterations in FGF receptors.

Potential therapeutic approach for RET-positive
adenocarcinoma
The multikinase inhibitor vandetanib (ZD6474) is
an inhibitor of RET and VEGFR1, and is approved for
medullary thyroid cancer with RET fusions. Its activity
in lung adenocarcinoma with translocated RET is
currently undefined. None of the trials conducted thus
far included sequencing to determine the status of RET,
but one ongoing trial of vandetanib, NCT01823068 (in
South Korea), will recruit patients whose tumors harbor
a RET translocation. Vandetanib is also being tested
in combination with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib
NCT01586624. Significant increases in PFS were
reported in three out of three patients with RETrearranged AC in a small trial of cabozantinib [126].
Other multikinase RTK inhibitors are also being tested
in RET-positive AC, including cabozantinib (XL-184) in
NCT01639508, ponatinib in NCT01813734, and sunitinib
in NCT01829217.

DDR2
Discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) are RTKs
that belong to the same family as EGFR. However,

DDRs are unique because they have native collagens
as their ligands. DDR2 mutations, identified by Sanger
sequencing as the tyrosine kinome in 11 of 290 (3.8%)
SQCC samples, may alter kinase activity, ligand binding,
or DDR2 localization [132]. A squamous cell lung cancer
patient with a response to dasatinib and erlotinib treatment
harbored a DDR2 kinase domain mutation [132]. A phase
2 trial NCT01514864 is currently examining dasatinib in
NSCLC with DDR2 mutation. However, previous studies
of dasatinib in unselected patient populations showed
significant toxicity and lack of benefit [133].

NSCLC (NCT01221077, NCT01186861).

NTRK1
About 3% of NSCLC tumors that have no known
driver mutation were found to harbor oncogenic fusions
of nerve growth factor receptor NTRK1 with MPRIP or
CD74 [137]. Translocations were found in women neversmokers. NTRK1 encodes protein TRKA with tyrosine
kinase activity. Lung cancer cells with NTRK1 fusions
were sensitive to kinase inhibitors of TRKA, and one of
them showed modest activity in a patient with NRFK1
translocation [137]. Crizotinib has been shown to have
modest activity against tumors that have NTRK1 fusion.

IGF1R
Insulin growth factor 1 receptor is an abundantly
expressed RTK, frequently elevated in lung cancer,
particularly in SCLC and certain NSCLC patients. There
has been interest in developing IGF1R-targeting clinical
options, but the validation of the efficacy of IGF1Rtargeted agents in large clinical trials had largely failed.
Considering the scarcity of targeted agents for SCLC,
IGF1R is certainly an attractive target. IGF1R activates
PI3K and MAPK signaling, and recently it was shown that
IGF1R is involved in signaling from mutant KRAS, which
also makes it a very attractive target in KRAS-mutated
NSCLC. NSCLC lines with activated KRAS depend on
the basal IGF1R activity for activation of PI3K pathway
[134]. Inhibitors of IGF1R are active in cell lines with
mutant, but not wild type, KRAS. Moreover, inhibition of
both IGF1R and MEK in vitro and in vivo in NSCLC with
mutant KRAS is highly cytotoxic [134].

1.2. RAS PATHWAY

KRAS
KRAS belongs to a family of small GTPases
(proteins with intrinsic GTPase activity) that regulate
cellular behavior in response to extracellular stimuli. Rasregulated signal pathways control processes such as actin
cytoskeletal integrity, proliferation, differentiation, cell
adhesion, apoptosis, and cell migration via the MAPK and
PI3K pathways. KRAS mutations are observed in close to
30% of adenocarcinomas of the lung, but are uncommon
in SQCC (about 5%) [138]. KRAS mutations are found
in majority of mucinous adenocarcinomas [139, 140].
Point mutations at codons 12, 13, or 61 in the KRAS
oncogene lead to constitutive activation of KRAS protein
via changes at the GTP binding domain, which prevents
the conversion of GTP to GDP. KRAS mutations are seen
more frequently in smokers (26%) versus never-smokers
(6%) [141]. In clinical trials, the prognostic significance
of KRAS mutations in NSCLC has been variable, with
some trials and pooled analyses reporting worse overall
prognosis and others failing to identify any difference in
survival outcomes [142, 143]. The presence of a KRAS
mutation has not consistently resulted in different survival
outcomes [141, 144].
Despite widespread KRAS mutations in a variety
of cancers, this protein has not been successfully targeted
therapeutically; however, several approaches are being
tested in clinical trials. KRAS-mutant tumors might be
uniquely sensitive to combinations of IGF1R and MEK
inhibitors [134]. KRAS-driven lung tumors are dependent
on the activity of the PI3K pathway, as shown recently in
a mouse model. KRAS interacts with the p110a subunit of
PI3 kinase, and disruption of this association impedes both
development and growth of already established tumors –
in particular, in combination with MEK inhibition [145].
Another preclinical study based on shRNA screening

Potential therapeutic options for activation of
IGFR1
Anti-IGF1R antibody figitumumab (CP-751,871)
in combination with carboplatinum-paclitaxel was tested
in NSCLC with some initial promising results [135], but
subsequent trials were discontinued because of futility and
unacceptable toxicity. Another antibody, cixutumumab,
was in clinical testing combined with chemotherapy,
but its development was discontinued based on negative
results of a randomized phase 2 trial. The monoclonal
antibody AMG-479 (ganitumab) was tested in several
clinical trials, which were either terminated or did not
meet endpoints, with only one trial, NCT01327612, still
ongoing. The combination of erlotinib with the IGF1R
monoclonal antibody, R1507, did not reveal a statistically
significant improvement in PFS or OS in NSCLC [136].
AXL1717, or picropodophyllin, is a small-molecule
inhibitor of IGF1R, which is currently tested in patients
with SQCC in trial NCT01561456. OSI-906/linsitinib
is another small-molecule. dual-kinase inhibitor of both
IGF1R and the insulin receptor. OSI-906 is in randomized
trials for SCLC (NCT01533181, NCT01387386) and

identified BCL-XL and MEK inhibition as a potentially
successful strategy for treatment of KRAS-mutant
adenocarcinoma [146]. There is potential in targeting the
membrane localization of KRAS, which is essential for
its activity. The correct localization of prenylated KRAS
depends on its interaction with prenyl-binding protein
PDEα. A compound was identified in a large screen and
further optimized to disrupt the interaction of PDEα with
KRAS. This compound, deltarasin, inhibited growth of
KRAS-mutant pancreatic cells in vitro and in vivo, and
might be promising for the future drug discovery efforts
[147].
Another cellular module activated by KRAS is
IKK-related kinases TBK and IKKα, which promote
KRAS driven tumorigenesis by upregulating production of
cytokines CCL5 and IL6. Compound CYT387 previously
known as inhibitor of JAK, is also a potent inhibitor of
TBK/IKKα with anti-tumor activity in mouse models
[148].
Lastly, the “untargetability” of KRAS has been
challenged recently, with development of specific smallmolecule inhibitors against KRAS (G12C) that have
undergone preclinical testing, and hopefully will come to
clinical fruition [149].

targeting both MAPK and AKT/PI3K pathways are
currently being tested in early-phase trials NCT01363232
(MEK162 and BKM120) and NCT01449058 (MEK162
and BYL719).
HSP90 inhibitors. Another approach to targeting
KRAS-mutated tumors clinically involves inhibition of
the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Retaspimycin HCL is
currently being tested with docetaxel (NCT01362400), and
everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) in NCT01427946; however,
preliminary reports on the docetaxel combination are
disappointing. The already-mentioned inhibitor AUY922
is currently being examined in a single-arm study in
NSCLS patients with KRAS, EGFR mutations, and EMLALK translocation (NCT01124864).
REOLYSIN is a proprietary formulation of human
reovirus, a naturally occurring oncolytic virus that
preferentially replicates in cancer cells with activated
KRAS. Reolysin in combination with carboplatinum and
paclitaxel has been evaluated in several solid tumors.
REOLYSIN and chemotherapy are currently in several
phase 2 clinical trials including NSCLC with mutant
KRAS or activated EGFR (NCT00861627), SQCC
(NCT00998192), and as salvage therapy in previously
treated NSCLC (NCT01708993). Preliminary positive
results were reported by the manufacturer in September
2013, with an overall response rate of 92% in a trial
involving 25 patients with SQCC.
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is being tested
in KRAS-mutant NSCLC phase 2 trial NCT01833143.

Potential therapeutic approach for KRAS
mutated NSCLC

MEK and mTOR inhibitors. Preliminary evidence

NF1/neurofibromin

suggests that MEK inhibition may be an effective strategy
in treating KRAS-mutated tumors and a number of
clinical trials are currently studying this approach. The
MEK inhibitor selumetinib showed promising results in
KRAS-mutated NSCLC when combined with docetaxel in
a phase 2 clinical trial [150]. The combination treatment
was associated with improved PFS and a trend to longer
OS. Another MEK inhibitor, trametinib, is currently
trialed in combination with several chemotherapeutic
drugs or erlotinib (NCT01192165). A recent study
identified the basis of different activity of MEK inhibitors
in BRAF versus KRAS mutant cancers. Unlike trametiniblike inhibitors, which inhibit phosphorylated MEK and
are effective in the setting of BRAFV600 mutants, the
new class of inhibitors, like GDC-0623, inhibit feedback
activation of MEK by RAF, and are therefore more
efficacious in the setting of mutant KRAS [151]. GDC0623 is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial NCT01106599.

NF1 is negative regulator of RAS pathway
activation, and a tumor suppressor. Germline mutations in
NF1 deregulate both PI3K and MAPK pathways and result
in familial neurofibromatosis. Mutations of NF1 in AC
were discovered through sequencing of a larger number
(623) of “suspected” cancer-related genes in a large
number (188) of tumors [88]. NF1 is mutated in more
than 10% of AC, but is also disrupted in 11% of SQCC
[4]. The functional significance of NF1 in lung cancer has
not been established, but because of its well-known role
in many other cancers it is reasonable to assume that it’s a
driver event in lung cancer as well. There are no specific
treatment options for NF1- disrupted tumors, but in recent
studies of NF1 in melanoma, it was successfully targeted
in mouse models with a combination of MEK and PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors [152]. A trial of MEK inhibitor MEK162
NCT01885195 is recruiting patients whose tumors
have alterations in components of the RAS-RAF-MEK
pathway, including NF1.

The combination of erlotinib and tivantinib (MET
inhibitor) in NSCLC showed clinical activity in patients
with KRAS-mutated cancers, even though the endpoints
of the trial were not achieved [95]. Tivantinib with
erlotinib is currently being tested versus chemotherapy
in NCT01395758. Lastly, the combination of inhibitors

NRAS, HRAS

Potential therapeutic approach for BRAFmutated NSCLC

Mutations in these well known oncogenic members
of RAS family are relatively rare in AC and SQCC (<1%),
except HRAS in SQCC (3%; [4]). In a very large cohort
of lung tumors, NRAS mutations were present in 0.7%
and most NRAS-mutated tumors were AC; these had
no other driver mutations implicating NRAS in driving
tumorigenesis [153]. Five of six cell lines established
from NRAS-mutant AC were sensitive to MEK inhibitors
selumetinib and trametinib, but not to other inhibitors
tested [153].

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, approved for
melanoma, is of limited use in NSCLC with BRAF
mutations other than V600E, but might be of value in
tumors with V600E mutations. Other BRAF mutations
could be potentially targeted with MEK inhibitors. The
RAF inhibitor sorafenib was tested in an unselected
population with NSCLC, and had little if any effect.
However, some clinical trials are addressing the efficacy
of targeted drugs in biomarker-selected patients. Trial
NCT01336634 examines BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib/
GSK2118436 in BRAF-mutant NSCLC, and preliminary
results suggest a promising clinical activity in pretreated
patients with stage IV NSCLC carrying BRAFV600E
mutation (overall response rate of 60%, BRF113928).
MEK inhibitor selumetinib/AZD6244 is tested in
various-BRAF mutant malignancies including NSCLC
in NCT00888134. BRAF mutant tumors are also targeted
using the combination of inhibitors of both MAPK and
AKT/PI3K pathways in early-phase trials NCT01363232
(MEK162 and BKM120) and NCT01449058 (MEK162
and BYL719).
Resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition in NSCLC
involves some of the mechanisms previously encountered
in BRAF mutant melanoma. One identified mechanism
involves expression of an aberrant form of BRAFV600E
resistant to inhibition, and the other relies on the autocrine
EGFR signaling driven by c-Jun–mediated EGFR ligand
expression and leading to activation of AKT [160].

RASA1
RASA1 (p120Ras GAP) is a well-known GTPaseactivating protein (GAP) that functions as a negative
regulator of Ras signaling downstream of several
growth-factor receptors [154]. RASA1 mutations have
been reported to be associated with hereditary capillary
malformations, but their potential involvement in cancer
only came to light through NGS-based analysis of SQCC,
where its recurrent mutations were found in 4% of tumors
[4]. The functional significance of this remains unknown.

1.3. BRAF/MAPK PATWHAY

BRAF
BRAF is a serine-threonine kinase whose only
known substrates are MEK1 and MEK2 in the MAPK
pathway. Mutated, activated BRAF occurs in about 7% of
all human cancers, but about 50% of melanomas contain
BRAF mutation at V600. NSCLC tumors harbor BRAF
mutations infrequently, including D594G and L596R
mutation in the kinase domain [155], and G465V or
G468A mutations in the G-loop of the activation domain
[156]. Only about half of BRAF mutations in NSCLC are
V600E [157]. The frequency of BRAF mutations in AC
is ~6%, and in SQCC ~4%. BRAF mutations occur much
more commonly in smokers than in nonsmokers [156].
Similarly to melanoma, BRAF mutations on their
own induce a senescent phenotype, which manifests
as benign adenomas in a mouse model of lung
carcinogenesis. Single-copy loss of LKB1 (see below)
is sufficient to drive the malignant progression of these
tumors to carcinomas [158]. BRAFV600E-driven lung
tumors in a mouse model depend on autophagy to sustain
their glutamine metabolism and growth, indicating that
targeting autophagy in this context could be clinically
relevant [159].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

1.4. PI3K PATHWAY
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
Akt pathway is activated in many different cancers,
including NSCLC. PIK3CA is the class IA PI3Kα
catalytic subunit p110α. Upon growth factor stimulation,
PIK3CA is activated, increasing PIP3 levels which drives
phosphorylation of AKT and downstream processes such
as higher protein translation (through mTOR activation),
cell division, and induction of anti-apoptotic response.
Activating mutations in PIK3CA have been implicated in
various cancers, and occur predominantly in the helical
or kinase domains of the alpha p110 catalytic subunit.
PI3K pathways activity is downregulated by the tumor
suppressor PTEN, a phosphatase subject to deletions or
mutations in a wide variety of tumors.

PIK3 kinase
All available data show that direct alterations in this
pathway are much more frequent in SQCC versus AC,
with mutations in three genes – PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT
1407

Oncotarget

significantly enriched in SQCC (Table 2). In addition,
PIK3CA gene amplification might occur in SQCC at a
much higher frequency than do activating mutations.
According to one study, PIK3CA copy-number gain was
found in ~33% of squamous cell tumors and in ~6.2%
of adenocarcinomas [161]. Large-scale NGS analysis of
SQCC found PIK3CA mutations in 16% of SQCC [4]
versus previously reported 3.6% of SQCC and 2.6% of
AC [161], with exon 9 as the most frequently mutated
site. PIK3CA mutations are not mutually exclusive with
EGFR or KRAS mutations, but are mutually exclusive
with FGFR amplification in SQCC [4].
Increase in PI3Kβ expression and loss of PTEN
is also observed more often in SQCC compared to AC,
suggesting that targeting of PI3K is a justified strategy in
treatment of SQCC [162].

currently ongoing, targeting PI3K in NSCLC either alone
or in combination with standard, cytotoxic chemotherapy.
These agents include PX-866, a PI3K inhibitor tested
with docetaxel in a phase 1/2 trial with a placebo arm
(NCT01204099). A phase 1 trial of the PI3K inhibitor
BKM120 in combination with chemotherapy is planned
(NCT01723800), and a phase 2 single-agent trial is
ongoing (NCT01297491). Trial NCT01487265 will
explore the combination of BKM-120 and erlotinib in
patients that previously responded to erlotinib but relapsed.
PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 is also in phase 2 combination
trials (NCT01493843, NCT00974584). NCT00975182 is a
phase 1 trial exploring the combination of GDC-0941 with
erlotinib. Another PI3K inhibitor, SAR245408, has shown
promising clinical activity in NSCLC [167].
AKT inhibitors. Phase 1 and 2 trials are currently
recruiting that offer MK2206 – an oral, potent, allosteric
inhibitor of AKT – in combination with either erlotinib or
gefitinib in advanced NSCLC. NCT01294306 is a phase 2
trial that examines combination of erlotinib and MK2206;
NCT01147211 explores gefitinib with MK2206. NCI
is sponsoring trial NCT01306045 involving molecular
profiling followed by administration of relevant targeted
therapies, among them MK2206 for mutations in PI3K,
AKT, or PTEN.
mTOR inhibitors. Multiple phase 1 and 2 trials
are recruiting patients for treatment of advanced NSCLC
with mTOR inhibition either alone or in combination with
chemotherapy or radiation therapy. These include agents
such as everolimus (>30 trials), sirolimus (>30 trials), and
temsirolimus (almost 30 trials).

PTEN
Inactivating mutations or deletions of PTEN, a lipid
phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP3 and negatively
regulates AKT, are observed in a wide variety of cancers,
including lung cancer. PTEN mutations (in exons 5–8)
were observed in 4.5% of NSCLC, significantly more
frequently in SQCC (10% [163] and 8% [4]). Copynumber losses of PTEN are not often associated with
NSCLC. However, loss of PTEN protein is observed much
more frequently, through loss of copies or methylation – in
particular, in SQCC [164]. A recent study has found that a
low level of PTEN expression does not necessarily signify
high activity of AKT, and that areas with different levels of
AKT activation co-exist within the same adenocarcinoma
of lung [165]. Apparently, signaling from IGF1R and other
factors influence activity of AKT in PTEN-low cells.

1.5. LKB1 (STK11)/AMPK PATHWAY

AKT

LKB1

Mutations of AKT1, a central kinase in the PI3K
pathway, are rare in NSCLC, occurring in ~1.9% of
cases, but are more frequent in SQCC (5.5%)[166]. The
large-scale NGS analysis of SQCC identified even more
frequent activating mutations in AKT3 – in 16% of tumors
[4] – further underlining the significance of the PI3K/AKT
pathway in pathogenesis of SQCC.

LKB1 is a known tumor suppressor whose germline
mutations are responsible for the familial cancer syndrome
known as Peutz-Jeghers, characterized by increased risk
for epithelial cancers including lung carcinomas. LKB1 is
an AMPK-activating kinase, and as such controls AMPK
function as energy sensor and master regulator of cellular
growth and metabolism. AMPK regulates activity of
mTORC by phosphorylating TSC1 in one of the AMPKgoverned pathways, which also include regulation of
OXPHOS and autophagy.
LKB1 mutations are found in 15% to 30% of
NSCLC, and half of these tumors have concurrent
mutations in KRAS [168]. Another study found
inactivation of LKB1 in 34% and 19% of 144 human
lungs in AC and SQCC, respectively [169]. Inactivation of
LKB1 on the background of oncogenic KRASG12D in a
mouse model resulted in lung tumors with high penetrance
for metastases [169]. Expression profiling of these tumors

Potential therapeutic approaches for alterations
in PI3K-AKT pathway
There are at least three potential targets for
therapeutic intervention in this pathway: AKT, PI3K, and
mTOR. Several drugs are in clinical development against
all three targets, including mTOR inhibitors that are
approved for other cancer types.
PI3K inhibitors. Several phase 1 and 2 trials are

Oncotarget

and human lung cancer cell lines identified a variety of
metastases-related genes (NEDD9, VEGFC, CD24) as
targets of LKB1. Integrated analysis of transcriptome and
phosphoproteome identified the SRC kinase activation as
a frequent event in tumors with LKB1 mutations [170].
Mutant LKB1 confers a major metabolic deficiency
on tumors driven by Kras in genetically engineered mouse
models. Dtymk, encoding deoxythymidylate kinase, which
catalyzes dTTP biosynthesis, is synthetically lethal with
Lkb1 deficiency in mouse and human lung cancer lines.
Global metabolite profiling demonstrated that Lkb1null cells had striking decreases in multiple nucleotide
metabolites as compared to Lkb1-wt cells. DTYMK is
therefore a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC [171].
Adenocarcinoma cells with mutant KRAS and
loss of LKB1 are also addicted to the mitochondrial
metabolism driven by lysosomal degradation of
macromolecules which, in turn, depends on coatomer
complex 1 (COP-1) [172].

are associated with poor prognosis [174] and resistance
to chemotherapy.

MDM2
E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 binds to TP53 and
promotes degradation of p53 through ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway. MDM2 is amplified in 22% of NSCLC patients
with and is associated with poor OS [175]. Prevention of
MDM2 binding could restore TP53 function in wild-type
TP53 tumors.
The MDM2-TP53 interaction has attracted serious
efforts to develop specific inhibitors. Discovery of
Nutlin-3, a promising inhibitor of MDM2 binding [176]
energized the search for clinically active drugs. Early
clinical testing of one such inhibitor, JNJ-26854165, did
not provide a basis for continuation. The new generations
of Nutlin-based and other drugs are in clinical studies for
various solid tumors. Encouraging results were reported
for one of them, R7112/RO5045337, in early clinical
testing for liposarcoma and other tumors [177]. Other
drugs – SAR405838 and RO5503781, also small-molecule
inhibitors of the MDM2-TP53 interaction – are in clinical
development for cancers other than lung. APR-246
(PRIMA-1MET), a drug that restores activity of unfolded
or mutant p53, was safe and showed indications of clinical
activity in hematological malignancies and prostate cancer
[178].

Potential treatment options for LKB1-deficient
cancers
In a mouse model mentioned above, triple inhibition
of SRC, MEK1, and PI3K resulted in tumor regression
[170]. Biguanide compounds traditionally used for
treatment of diabetes have shown activity in pre-clinical
models of NSCLC with LKB1 and KRAS mutations [173].
In this study, metformin, in wide use for diabetes, was less
potent than phenformin, which fell out of favor because
of its tendency to induce lactic acidosis in some patients.
Neither is likely to be effective as single treatments for
NSCLC with LKB1 mutations. Metformin is currently
being tested in combination with Paclitaxel, Carboplatin,
and Bevacizumab in a phase 2 randomized clinical trial
NCT01578551 for adenocarcinoma of lung.

1.7. RB1 PATHWAY

RB1
RB1 is a well-known tumor suppressor with
an important role in controlling the cell cycle, that
is frequently inactivated in many human cancers.
Hypophosphorylated RB controls the transcription factors
E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3, which are necessary for the G1
to S transition of the cell cycle. In normal cells, RB1 is
phosphorylated by the cyclin D/CDK4 complex to release
E2F factors for initiation of the cell cycle. Mutations
of RB1 are rare in AC, more frequent in SQCC (7%),
and ubiquitous in SCLC at over 90% of tumors [179].
Nevertheless, frequent disruption of the CDKNA2 locus
in SQCC significantly increases the involvement of RB1mediated pathways in this type of lung cancer.

1.6. TP53 PATHWAY

TP53
Inactivating mutations in TP53 are the most
common alterations affecting any specific gene in human
cancer. Inactivating mutations in TP53 disrupt its key
function in controlling cellular proliferation and apoptosis.
Some mutations in TP53 confer “gain of function”, and
the resulting mutant TP53 protein actually contributes to
different stages of tumorigenesis or to the drug resistance.
Mutations in TP53 in lung cancer are strongly associated
with smoking, and are also the most common somatogenic
alterations in NSCLC, occurring in over half of AC, 80%
of SQCC and 70% of SCLC. The TP53 locus is also
frequently affected by copy losses. Mutations in TP53
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CDKNA2 locus
Two tumor suppressors are encoded within this
CDKNA2 locus: p14ARF, which activates p53 through
inhibition of its major negative regulator MDM2; and
p16INK4a, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
1409

Oncotarget

activates retinoblastoma (RB) through negative regulation
of CDK4. Loss of CDKN2A was reported to occur in 15%
of SQCC and in >20% of adenocarcinoma. P16INK4a
is made nonfunctional by other types of alterations in
SQCC, such as epigenetic silencing, exon skipping, and
mutations, bringing the percentage of SQCC tumors with
dysfunctional p16INK4a to 72% [4].

1.8. MYC PATHWAY

expression of MCL1, and together expression of these two
genes significantly correlated with poor prognosis [184].
MCL1 is a member of the BCL2 family of anti-apoptotic
proteins; inhibitors of this family have already been tested
in men, and are still in clinical trials.
Transcriptional activity of MYC might be one of the
converging factors of the activation of MAPK and PI3K
pathways, and it could be targeted at the level of MYC
accessory transcription factors such as bromodomaincontaining proteins [185]. A BET bromodomain inhibitor,
JQ1, showed remarkable antitumor activity in a mouse
model of KRAS-driven NSCLC, albeit sensitivity was
abrogated in tumors containing both KRAS mutation and
inactivation of LKB1 [186]. Downregulation of MYC
protein was key to tumor response to JQ1 treatment.
SCLC cell line tumors without amplified MYC
genes show recurrent inactivation of MAX, a MYCassociated protein. MAX mediates transactivation of
pro-differentiation genes by virtue of suppressing activity
of MYC, and it suppresses MYC-mediated activation of
stemness-related genes [187], acting as a bona-fide tumor
suppressor.

MYC family

Potential therapeutic approaches for MYC
overexpression

Potential therapeutic approaches to alterations in
RB pathway
Potential treatment of p16INK4A deficiency
could involve inhibition of CDK4/6. A trial of the
CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 in selected patients with
advanced NSCLC and disrupted p16INK4a is ongoing
(NCT01291017). BAY1000394, a pan-CDK inhibitor,
is currently being tested in a phase 1/2 trial in SCLC
(NCT01573338), in combination with chemotherapeutic
drugs (no placebo arm).

The aurora A kinase inhibitor MLN8237/alisertib
is in clinical trial phase 1/2 for lung and other cancers
(NCT01045421) and, in combination with erlotinib, for
NSCLC (NCT01471964). Other aurora kinase inhibitors
have been clinically tested in a variety of malignancies,
but most showed little promise in terms of safety and/or
efficacy.

The protoocogene and master regulator of
transcription, MYC, controls transcription networks
governing proliferation, metabolism, ribosome biogenesis,
and protein synthesis. However, when overexpressed,
MYC induces expression of pro-apoptotic protein BAX,
which induces mitochondrially mediated apoptosis. MYC
is amplified in >30% of adenocarcinomas and in 16%
to 30% of SCLC patients. MYC-family genes such as
MYC, MYCL1, and MYCN are amplified in a mutually
exclusive manner in SCLC, as observed in other tumors
of neuroendocrine origin.
Experiments in a mouse model demonstrated that
MYC is a valid therapeutic target in KRAS-driven NSCLC
whose systemic inhibition eradicates tumors [180].
However, MYC is a notoriously difficult therapeutic
target, both because of its dominant role in many normal
cellular processes, and because the tertiary structure
of MYC protein is challenging in respect to modeling
of inhibitors. Nevertheless, the possibility of targeting
downstream effectors of MYC remains viable. Thus,
SCLC with MYC amplification is sensitive to inhibition
of aurora kinase B (AURKB) [181].
The anti-apoptotic protein MCL1 is overexpressed
and amplified in over 30% of AC [2, 182]. Examination
of MCL1 in NSCLC patients showed no prognostic value
[183]. However, subsequently MCL1 was identified as a
protein whose expression is involved in survival of tumors
that have high levels of the oncogene MYC. The majority
of MYC- overexpressing NSCLC were positive for

1.9. EPIGENETIC PATHWAYS
Deregulation of the epigenome is now recognized to
be a common feature of cancers. Epigenetics encompasses
several processes, such as DNA methylation, histone
modifications and RNA interference. The importance of
DNA methylation, for example, was recognized when
a study demonstrated clinical utility for prognostic
purposes of the methylation status of a four-gene panel
in early-stage NSCLC [188]. Since then, and largely
due to unbiased NGS efforts, somatic alterations were
identified in a number of genes involved in epigenetic
regulation in all major types of lung cancer (Tables
1 and 2). Interestingly, there is no overlap between the
genes involved in regulation of epigenome between
three major types of lung cancer. This suggests different
clinicopathological origins of the three major lung cancer
types.
In AC, mutations were found in tumor suppressors
SMARCA4/BRG1 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated,
actin-dependent regulators of chromatin) and ARID1A
1410

Oncotarget

(AT-rich interaction domain 1A) – both members of
the SWI/SNF complex, in 8% and 10% of tumors,
respectively [2]. BRG1 is inactivated in lung cancer in
a manner mutually exclusive with MYC amplification
[189] and inactivation of both BRG1 and MAX is a
synthetic lethal interaction [187]. SWI/SNF-chromatinremodeling complex might protect cells against DNA
damage by ensuring DNA repair through cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis. A number of cancer-related proteins such
as p21CIP, BRCA1, MYC, FOS, and LKB1 are known to
associate with the SWI/SNF complex.
SETD2 is a trimethyltransferase responsible for
methylation of histone H3 on Lys36 (H3K36me3). This
epigenomic histone mark ensures efficient DNA mismatch
repair during replication process [190]. It is mutated in 4%
to 5% of AC.
MLL2 is a histone methyltransferase mutated in
19% of SQCC [4]. So far, this is the only gene product
involved in epigenetic regulation that was found to be
mutated in SQCC. MLL genes are also mutated in 10%
of SCLC [5].
CREBBP/CBP
and
EP300,
histone
acetyltransferase coactivators, are mutated in 18% of
SCLC [5]. Both are transcriptional coactivators with roles
in many transcriptional programs and biological processes,
conducted through acetylation of lysine residues on
histones.
EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) is a
methyltransferase and a component of repressive-PRC2
complex that triggers transcriptional repression by
catalyzing the addition of methyl groups onto lysine 27 of
histone H3 (H3K27me2/3). EZH2 expression is controlled
by E2F transcription factor that are, in turn, controlled by
RB1, whose loss of function is a hallmark of SCLC. EZH2
is an accepted oncogene in metastatic prostate cancer, and
its expression is highly elevated in SCLC [6] where it is
likely to activate a transcriptional program promoting the
aggressive character of SCLC. Higher EZH2 expression
in lung AC is associated with shortened recurrence-free
survival and overall survival [191].
KDM2A, histone H3 lysine 36 demethylase, is
overexpressed in a subset of NSCLC patients and is
indispensable for tumorigenicity and invasiveness of
KDM2A-overexpressing NSCLC cells. The primary
target of KDM2A-mediated repression is the dualspecificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3) gene, whose protein
dephosphorylates ERK1/2. High KDM2A levels are
associated with low DUSP3, high phospho-ERK levels,
and poor prognosis [192].
Therapeutic options for targeting epigenomic
alterations are limited at this time to drugs that show little
or no selectivity. DNA methylation inhibitors, typically
nucleoside analogs, target DNA methyltransferases,
leading to demethylation of DNA and gene re-expression.
Several nucleoside analogues – 5-azacytidine and 5-aza,
2′-deoxycytidine – were found to be effective in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemias
and are FDA approved for these indications. Histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors targeting acetyltransferases
expand the repertoire of possible target genes, and several
HDAC inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials
with encouraging findings. Large-scale analysis of
transcriptomes in AC versus SQCC tumors identified
disruption of numerous histone-modifying enzymes in
SQCC, and indicated that HDAC inhibition is a promising
treatment strategy [193]. Phase 1/2 trial NCT00907179
addresses the safety and efficacy of Panobinostat/LBH589
in non-squamous NSCLC. NCT00387465, a phase
1/2 study, explores a combination of HDAC inhibitor
entinostat/MS-275 with azacytidine in recurrent NSCLC.

1.10. OXIDATIVE STRESS

NRF2 (NFE2L2), KEAP1, and CUL3
Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (NRF2
or NFE2L2) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that
positively regulates the expression of various genes with
protective function against oxidative stress (antioxidants,
xenobiotic, detoxification enzymes and more). Kelch-like
ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) is a ubiquitin ligase
that negatively regulates NRF2 activity by targeting it
for proteasomal degradation. Inactivation of KEAP1 is a
frequent event in NSCLC [194], with mutations and copynumber losses in ~11% of AC and 12% of SQCC cases.
Loss of KEAP1 function is predicted to increase signaling
from NRF2, leading to an increase in anti-oxidative
responses and protection of cells from cytotoxic chemoand radiation therapies.
SQCC tumors have additional alterations in the
pathway that lead to sustained signaling through NRF2,
including NRF2 itself, which is mutated in 19% of SQCC
tumors. Mutations are found exclusively in the KEAP1
interacting motifs [4] suggesting that they contribute to
the stability rather than activation of NRF2. An additional
7% of SQCC tumors have an inactivating mutation in the
CUL3 gene, which encodes an E3 ligase directly involved
in degradation of NRF2. Altogether, the NRF2 inactivation
is negatively affected in 34% of SQCC [4]. KEAP1 serves
as an adaptor to CUL3 to initiate degradation of NRF2
[195]. Mutations in KEAP1 and CUL3 are mutually
exclusive with mutations in NRF2 [4].
Nuclear localization of NRF2 (assumed by NRF2
protein that is not bound by KEAP1) was seen in 26% of
NSCLCs; it was significantly more common in SQCCs
(38%) than in adenocarcinomas (18%), and is associated
with poor prognosis [196].
The involvement of the NRF2 pathway in
tumorigenesis remains controversial, though mouse model
studies indicate that in early stages of tumorigenesis NRF2

to resistance to chemotherapy (reviewed in [197]).
A recent study suggests that induction of oxidative
stress by targeting enzyme SOD1 could be of benefit in
NSCLC. SOD1 inhibitor ATN-224 increases levels of
peroxide, activates p38 pathway, and decreases levels of
anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1, inducing regression of tumors
in a mouse model of NSCLC [198].

target.

WNT pathway
WNT signaling is involved in pathogenesis
of NSCLC but mutations in APC and β-catenin are
uncommon. Still, there is evidence that inhibition of WNT
pathway in vitro inhibits proliferation of lung cancer cells
and downregulation of WNT-pathway inhibitory proteins
in cell lines and tumor biopsies (reviewed in [205]).
Vanctitumab/OMP18R5, an antibody targeting frizzled
7 in the WNT pathway, has entered clinical testing in
NSCLC, in trial NCT01957007.

1.11. DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAYS
The involvement of reactivation of embryonic or
stem cell transcriptional programs in lung cancer might
be underestimated, since the NGS analyses are more
geared towards identification of somatic alterations.
A recent study of almost 300 lung tumors identified an
ectopic gene-expression signature associated with highly
aggressive tumors, which was an independent predictor
of poor prognosis. The common molecular features were
the acquisition of embryonic stem cell/germ cell gene
expression profiles and the down-regulation of immune
response genes [199].
Differentiation and embryonic development related
genes and pathways are involved in all three major types
of lung cancer (Tables 1 and 2), and the particular genes
affected by mutations or other alterations seem to be
almost predetermined by the respective roles of these
genes in development of relevant lineages. The different
spectra of developmental pathways altered in three
major types of lung cancer, together with the observed
differences in disregulated epigenetic pathways, is strong
evidence of different origins of the tumor-initiating cells
and pathology in AC, SQCC, and SCLC. Most of these
gene products in altered developmental pathways are
predictably transcription factors. Unfortunately, targeting
these is currently not approaching clinical development.

RUNX3
RUNX3, a developmentally important transcription
factor and tumor suppressor is often methylated in lung
cancer [206]. RUNX3 suppresses the development of lung
adenoma in the setting of activated KRAS, and this effect
is mediated by RUNX3-induced expression of p14ARF
and p21WAF/CIP [207]. These findings provide a link
between the pathways activated by mutant KRAS and the
p53-p14 ARF pathways.

Disrupted differentiation program in SQCC
A number of genes involved in development and in
squamous cell differentiation were found to be mutated
in SQCC, in 44% of samples examined. The alterations
include amplifications (TP63, SOX2); loss of function
mutations in NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and ASCL4, and focal
deletions in FOXP1 [4].
HMG box transcription factor SOX2 is a lineagesurvival oncogene expressed during initiation of branching
morphogenesis in lung, but enforced high expression of
SOX2 prevents branching and differentiation [208].
SOX2 amplification was detected in SQCC of lung and
esophagus, and is required for survival of SQCC cell lines
[209]; an NGS study [4] identified SOX2 amplification in
21% of lung SQCC. Histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1
was found to be significantly elevated in Sox2-expressing
SQCC, and inhibition of LSD1 with selective inhibitor
CBB1007 had a cytotoxic effect on cell lines with SOX2
amplification [210]. LSD1 specifically demethylates
histone H3K4. LSD1 inactivation directly impairs the
Sox2-dependent transcriptional program by reducing
the lineage-survival oncogene function and inhibiting
Sox2-mediated repression of differentiation genes. These
findings make LSD1 an epigenetic target for therapy in
Sox2-expressing cancers.
A gene frequently co-amplified with SOX2 in
3q26 is PRKCα that phosphorylates SOX2 facilitating
its recruitment to the promoter of Hedgehog (Hh)

NKX2.1 (TTF1, TTIF1)
NKX2.1 is a homeobox transcription factor essential
for development of the normal lung, in particular in
branching morphogenesis. NKX2.1 is amplified in up
to 20% of lung adenocarcinoma, but not in SQCC [4,
200, 201]. A number of targets of NKX2.1 have been
identified, among them E2F3, cyclin B1, cyclin B2, c-Met,
and RTK-like gene ROR1, with consequent activation
of PI3K [202], a network of transcription factors, and
vaccinia-related kinase VRK-1 [203].
Possible therapeutic implications of NKX2.1
amplification are activation of ROR1 (which sustains
activity of c-Src), kinase activity-independent EGFRERBB3 association, ERBB3 phosphorylation, and
consequential PI3K activation [204]. As an RTK, ROR1
could be targeted in the future. The kinase VRK-1,
activated through NKX2.1 signaling, is also a potential

acyltransferase (HHAT). HHAT represents a rate-limiting
step in the maturation of the Hh ligand [211]. PRKCα
and SOX2 might act as oncogenic co-drivers in SQCC,
as neither alone is sufficient for tumor initiation. PKCιSOX2-HHAT axis contributes to the “stem-like”
phenotype of SQCC and could be targeted with PKCα
inhibitors or with inhibitors of HHAT that are being
developed [212].
Notch signaling is required for the cell- fate
decision between ciliated and non-ciliated secretory
epithelium in developing lung [213]. Expression of Notch
is associated with the stem cell compartment. Proteintruncating mutations of Notch receptors were reported
in a majority of cutaneous SQCC and in SQCC of lung,
but activating mutations of NOTCH1 commonly occur in
human lymphoid malignancies. However, in progenitor
basal cells of airway epithelium Notch signaling is
required for differentiation but not cell renewal [214],
perhaps explaining the role of abrogated Notch signaling
in pathogenesis of lung SQCC. Inactivation of Notch is
observed in 13% of lung SCC [4]. Notch signaling is active
in “tumor propagating”, i.e., cancer stem cells in NSCLC
models, and Notch3, in particular, is nonredundant in
KRAS-driven tumors [215]. Inhibitors of β-secretase
RO4929097, a protease needed for activation of Notch
signaling, are in clinical trials for NSCLC, including phase
2 NCT01193868, and in combination with erlotinib in
NCT01193881 and with cediranib NCT01131234.
TP63 is considered to be a marker of stem cell
compartment in different lineages, and is a regulator of
squamous cell differentiation involved in the development
of tracheobronchial epithelium [216]. Detection of TP63
by immunostaining is a useful marker that distinguishes
lung SQCC from SCLC [217]. Amplification of TP63
was reported in SQCC-derived cell lines [218] and in
16% of tumors [4]. An in vivo model of SQCC (not of
lung origin) showed that TP63 signaling is essential for
tumor growth, and identified a survival program governed
by TP63 that involves signaling from FGFR2 activated
by stroma-derived ligand [219]. Clinical FGFR inhibitor
AZD4547 was highly efficient in ablating this TP63
induced paracrine signaling in the mouse model.
Truncations of ASCL4, a member of the achaetescute complex family of genes, were found in 3% of
SQCC [4], and are thought to affect a developmentally
important gene based on analogy to ASCL1, a related gene
product essential for survival of SCLC (see below).

member of the achaete-scute family, and it is essential for
differentiation of numerous pulmonary neuroendocrine
(NE) cells and tissues during lung development [220].
ASCL1 is highly expressed in SCLC [221]. Hes-1 is a
transcriptional target of the Notch pathway and it blocks
transcription of ASCL1. The Notch pathway is suppressed
in SCLC [222], and activation of Notch signaling in SCLC
induces growth arrest, suggesting that this pathway could
be explored as a therapeutic target [223].
Hedgehog (HH) pathway is frequently activated
in SCLC [224] as seen in the immunochemistry analysis
of tumors [225]. Nevertheless, somatic alterations in
the HH pathway have not been detected. Deletion of
hedgehog- signaling-molecule Smoothened (Smo) halted
development of SCLC in a mouse model [226]. Activation
of HH signaling after chemotherapy appears to be critical
in development of chemoresistance, which is an inherent
feature of SCLC. The HH pathway is a potentially
druggable target, at least in SCLC mouse models, but it
is unknown what specific genetic alterations in SCLC are
associated with the activation of HH signaling. One phase
1 trial for SCLC is ongoing that compares chemotherapy
alone or in combination with HH inhibitor GDC-0449/
vismodegib or with cixutumumab NCT00887159. New
inhibitors of Hh signaling targeting enzyme HHAT are in
development [212].
SLIT proteins are secreted ligands for ROBO
receptors, which are involved in axon guidance and
cell migration. Robo1-deleted mice do not develop
normal lungs and most die early after birth; survivors die
within the first year of life and show epithelial bronchial
hyperplasia [227]. Both SLIT2 and ROBO1 were shown
to act as tumor suppressors in lung cancer [228, 229].
SLIT2 is mutated in 10% of SCLC patients [5].
EPHA7 (ephrin receptor A7) is frequently lost
in lymphomas and other tumors and acts as a soluble
tumor suppressor. EPHA7 plays an important role in
development and regulates repulsion versus adhesion of
migrating cells, including during neural tube formation
[230]. EPHA7 is mutated in 10% of SCLC [5].

Repositioning of antidepressants for treatment of
SCLC.
The neuroendocrine nature of cells comprising
SCLC tumors might offer unorthodox treatment options.
A recent study has used a bioinformatics approach to
identify drugs of potential benefit in treating SCLC. A
no-longer-used class of antidepressants, tricyclics, was
found to have a potent cytotoxic activity in SCLC in
vitro and in vivo. Tricyclics disrupt the autocrine survival
signals involving neurotransmitters and their G protein–
coupled receptors [231]. On the basis of these findings,
phase 2a clinical trial NCT01719861 examining tricyclic
desipramine in SCLC is recruiting patients.

Involvement of developmental pathways in SCLC
A limited number of development pathways are
inappropriately activated in SCLC, some related to the
neuroendocrine nature of this deadly cancer. Changes in
expression of some key developmentally important genes
are more characteristic for SCLC than are mutations.
ASCL1 is a lineage-specific, basic helix-loop-helix

cancers [234]. Expression of the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) was
shown to be a very strong predictor of response in this
study. Unfortunately, testing for predictive biomarkers of
immune response is still in its infancy and is not always
conducted even if a target of intervention is known (such
as expression of PD-L1). Similarly, a vaccination trial
could be conducted with a defined tumor-associated
antigen, but its expression in a given patient’s tumor is not
routinely examined.
In addition, the accepted frameworks for evaluation
of the anti-cancer drug efficacy, Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and WHO
criteria, might not be appropriate for the evaluation of
immunotherapeutic agents, because the latter might
produce responses that are heterogeneous and could be
delayed or even involve an early increase in tumor burden.
Therefore, assessment of responses to immune therapy is
being reconsidered [235].
In general, immunotherapeutic approaches in
lung cancer might have to be multi-pronged, involving
both stimulation of immune responses and inhibition of
immune checkpoints, or combination with chemo- or
targeted therapies that might, in certain scenarios, increase
the efficacy of immunotherapies.

The gene encoding the catalytic subunit of
telomerase (TERT) shows copy gains in 42% of AC [2].
The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat sodium/GRN163L
(antisense oligonucleotide) is currently being trialed in
breast cancer, and a telomerase vaccine GV1001 is being
trialed in NSCLC (NCT01579188).
Even though a number of studies reported an
association between certain polymorphisms in DNAdamage repair genes and incidence of lung cancer, largescale studies have not revealed recurrent mutations in this
group, except for ATM in AC [2]. ATM shows in-frame
indels and truncating mutations in ~10% of AC [2].
SCLC cells show increased levels of PARP1 expression compared with NSCLC cells, and are
significantly more sensitive to PARP-1 inhibition,
suggesting that PARP-1 is a valid therapeutic target in
SCLC [6]. In particular, a new PARP-1 inhibitor, BMN673, is highly active against SCLC in vitro and in vivo,
but PI3K pathway activation is associated with resistance
to BMN-673 [232]. PARP-1 inhibitors are in clinical
testing for SCLC, either as a single agent (BMN 673 in
phase 1 trial NCT01286987), or in combination with
temozolomide (veliparib in phase 2 trial NCT01638546).

2.1. Blockade of immune checkpoints

2. IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR LUNG CANCER

Inhibition of immune checkpoints must rely on
presence and functional activity of the tumor infiltrating
cells (TIL). Even though immunomodulatory antibodies
targeting CTLA4 or PD-1 interactions with its ligands
showed promising responses in lung cancer, the nonresponsive patients might benefit from additional
stimulation of TILs and /or modulation of tumor
microenvironment that dampens immune responses
(reviewed in [236]. The role of oncogenic pathways
in orchestrating immune escape is exemplified by the
upregulation of PD-L1 in NSCLC with mutant EGFR
[7]. Inhibition of EGFR enhanced T cell function and
improved survival of tumor-bearing mice [7]. A recent
study conducted in animal model (breast cancer) suggested
that irradiation leads to elevated expression of PD-L1 in
tumors and increases the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 treatments
[237]. Observations like this may be useful in mapping
new strategies for co-treatments with immune checkpoint
antibodies.
CTLA4 is an inhibitory molecule expressed on T
cells that is involved in the negative regulation of T cell
interaction with antigen-presenting dendritic cells (APCs).
CTLA4 inhibits binding of CD28 on T cells to B7 proteins
on APCs, thus weakening the costimulation of T cells.
CTLA4 is also expressed on tumor cells [238]. Available
results from clinical trials indicate that the response rates
to CTLA4 blockade with human monoclonal antibodies
ipilimumab and tremelimumab are at most 18%, but
responses tend to be more durable than those seen with

Immunotherapy has become an exciting area
in oncology, with new therapies directed at various
tumors, with some early successes in particular with
immunomodulatory antibodies. More clinical research is
now being conducted in NSCLC. Lung cancer in general
is not known as an immunogenic cancer, with very few
articles addressing immune infiltrates in lung tumors.
This is very much unlike the well-characterized presence
of infiltrates in melanoma and other cancers, where they
are known to have a proven predictive significance.
Nevertheless, early successes with immunomodulatory
antibodies in NSCLC have been reported (see below
and review [233]). It is already apparent that responses
to immunotherapy, though shown to be rare in current
studies, tend to be long lasting, unlike what is seen with
most targeted therapies.
Experience with small-molecule targeted therapies
across cancer types has revealed a relatively high rate of
response of limited duration followed by development
of resistance. Conversely, immunotherapy agents tend
to produce responses in fairly small subpopulations of
patients but these responses are often durable. The biggest
challenge in developing successful immunotherapies is
the identification of biomarkers predictive of response.
The incorporation of immunotherapy markers into
clinical studies is of high importance, which has been
demonstrated in a trial of the anti-PD-1 antibody in several

cytotoxic therapies. Significant autoimmune toxicities
were reported in a number of trials, and, interestingly,
strong association of immune-related toxicities and
responses were observed [239].
A recent phase 2 study of chemotherapy and
ipilimumab in advanced NSCLC showed a statistically
significant improvement in PFS in patients initially treated
with carboplatin and paclitaxel for two cycles; they then
received ipilimumab with chemotherapy for four more
cycles [240]. Overall survival was 12.2 months, similar to
results from the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and
bevacizumab. Patients with squamous histology showed
better response compared to those with nonsquamous
histology. Given these results, a current phase 3 study
(NCT01285609) will randomize 920 patients with SQCC
to phased-in ipilimumab with carboplatin and paclitaxel
versus chemotherapy alone. A similarly designed phase 3
trial (NCT01450761) compares ipilimumab to placebo in
SCLC patients receiving platinum and etoposide. Phase
2 trial NCT01331525 addresses the same combination as
one-arm study for patients with extensive-stage SCLC.
Phase 1 trial NCT01820754 is currently evaluating
the addition of ipilimumab to standard treatment for
patients with previously untreated NSCLC. Phase 2 trial
NCT01471197 is comparing ipilimumab to pemetrexed in
non-squamous NSCLC.
Ipilimumab is also being evaluated in combination
with anti-KIR antibody BMS-986015 in patients
with NSCKC, CRPC and melanoma in the phase 1
trial NCT01750580. BMS-986015 targets killer-cell
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) expressed on
natural killer (NK) cells, therefore blocking the inhibitory
function of KIR.

blockade will have to include identification of predictive
biomarkers of response [236].
In a trial for several different malignancies, antiPD1 antibodies were well tolerated and the maximum
tolerated dose has not been reached [234]. This study
found a strong correlation between pretreatment tumor
expression of PD-L1 and responses. The better safety
profile of PD-1 antibody versus CTLA-4 antibody is most
likely due to the fact that the latter targets a peripheral
interaction between T cells and APCs. Inhibition of PD-1
probably affects peripheral interactions as well, through
PD-L2 on APCs, but it might act more locally at tumor
sites through blocking the interaction of PD-L1 on tumor
cells with PD-1 in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Anti-PD-L1
antibody was also tested in several cancers, including
melanoma, and objective responses were observed in 9 of
52 melanoma patients; the responses were durable [242].
Nivolumab (MDX-1106, BMS-936558) is a fully
human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 antibody that
binds PD-1 with high afﬁnity and blocks its interaction
with both PD-L1 and PD-L2. A phase 1 trial showed
limited responses in patients with different malignancies,
including mixed responses in one enrolled NSCLC patient
[243]. In a phase 2 trial, nivolumab showed long-lasting,
objective responses (OR) in patients with solid tumors –
including NSCLC patients, of whom 14 of 76 responded
[234]. Responses were dose-dependent in NSCLC,
but not in melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma
patients enrolled in the trial. Expression of PD-L1 on
available pretreatment biopsies was a predictive marker
of response to Nivolumab. A response rate of 36% was
observed in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors, and 0%
in the PD-L1-negative group [234].
Nivolumab is currently in a number of trials in
patients with NSCLC and two trials specifically for SQCC,
either as a single agent or in combination with other
targeted therapies or chemotherapy agents or ipilimumab
NCT01454102 Combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab
has already produced outstanding responses in patients
with metastatic melanoma [244], and now entered trials for
other cancers, including NSCLC NCT01928394. Some of
these trials include testing for PD-L1 expression in tumors,
which have been confirmed to be predictive of responses
to nivolumab (J Clin Oncol 31, 2013 (suppl; abstr
3016)). Nivolumab is also being tested in a phase 1 trial
(NCT01714739) in combination with anti-KIR antibody
BMS-986015 and in NCT01629758 in combination with
IL-21. The role of demethylating agents in modulating
the response to immune-checkpoint inhibition is explored
in trial NCT01928576; this involves pretreatment with
azacytidine, entinostat, or CC-486 which, according to a
recent study might sensitize NSCLC to anti-PD1 therapy
[245].
Another
anti-PD-1
antibody,
MK-3475
(Lambrolizumab), produced lasting responses in
previously treated NSCLC patients at the rate of 24%.

PD-1.
PD-1 plays a major role in the tumor immune
escape by inhibiting survival, proliferation, and immune
function of T cells through interaction with its ligands PDL1 and L2. Unlike CTLA-4, expression of PD-1 is not
limited to T cells and is found in B cells and some myeloid
cells. PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, have different
expression patterns, with PD-L1 found on multiple
normal and cancerous cells including lung tumors,
where it could provide, once bound by PD-1, peripheral
tolerance to “self” antigens. PD-L2 is expressed on APC
cells, providing tolerance to orally administered antigens.
Interactions between PD-1 and its ligands attenuate
immune responses [241], and, in the context of cancer,
serve to protect tumor cells from cytotoxic T cells.
Completed clinical studies of humanized antibodies
directed against PD-1 and PD-L1 showed a good safety
profile and remarkable antitumor activity in subsets of
patients with metastatic disease, including lung cancer,
which is considered to be a tumor type not responsive to
immunotherapy. Future development of the PD-1 pathway

Median progression-free survival has not been reached and
will be at least 52 weeks (15th World Conference on Lung

NSCLC, including the phase ½ trial NCT01840579 that
will determine the MTD first, after which Lambrolizumab
will be tested in combination with chemotherapy. The

on the results cited above that showed a strong correlation
of the efficacy of Nivolumab with PD-L1 expression. MK3475 is also tested in phase 2/3 study NCT01905657 for
patients whose tumors express PD-L1.

clinical trials for different tumors. Safety concerns caused
suspension of the trial after several patients developed
liver problems, including high-grade hepatitis. However,
the antibody has a promise in expanding the repertoire of
functional CD8+ effector cells during T cell expansion for
autologous cell transfer (ACT).
GITR is a costimulatory receptor expressed after T
cell activation that enhances T cell function and survival.
Importantly, GITR also negatively affects regulatory T
cells (Tregs), and treatment with GITR agonistic antibody
destabilizes intra-tumor Tregs allowing for more efficient
cytolysis by CD8+ T cells [246]. A trial with anti-GITR
antibody TRX-518 is ongoing in melanoma patients.
OX40 is not involved in effector T cell activation,
but rather, promotes T cell survival and expansion. In a
clinical study, based at the Portland Providence Medical
Center in Oregon, patients received three infusions of
the agonistic mouse anti-OX40 antibody within a week.
The nature of the antibody precluded further treatments.
Nine of 27 patients experienced minor tumor shrinkage,
although none met RECIST (response evaluation criteria
in solid tumors) criteria for objective responses.
CD40. Unlike the costimulatory targets above,
CD40 is expressed on APCs, while its ligand is expressed
on T cells. Binding of the two acts as a powerful enhancer
of APCs’ ability to present antigens and activate T cells
against foreign targets. A large number of cancer patients
received infusions of agonistic antibody CP870,893 and
some responses were observed [247]. A surprising finding
was that treatments did not increase numbers of TILs
in the tumors. In a mouse model, antibody treatments
induced an influx of macrophages into tumors, presumably
with enhanced cytotoxic activities.

PD-L1.
BMS-936559, a high-afﬁnity human IgG4 antiPD-L1 that blocks PD-L1 binding to PD-1, showed a
promising clinical activity and good safety profile in a
phase 1 trial, with objective responses observed in 5 of 49
NSCLC patients enrolled [242]. This multicenter study,
NCT00729664, is ongoing.
Other anti-PD-L1 antibodies are also in clinical
development. MPDL3280A/RG7446 is currently
being tested as a single-agent in two clinical trials:
NCT01846416, a phase 2 trial for locally advanced or
metastatic NSCLC, and NCT01375842, a phase 1 trial
examining several different malignancies including lung
cancer. Preliminary results from the former trial found
that PD-L1 tumor expression and T cell gene signature
correlate with response to MPDL3280A. MPDL3280A
therapy led to T-cell reactivation and restored antitumor
immunity (J Clin Oncol 31, 2013 (suppl; abstr 3001)). The
phase 1 trial NCT01633970 is currently evaluating the
combination of MDLP3280A with bevacizumab (Avastin)
and chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancers. A
recent report (European Cancer Congress 2013, Abs.
3048) announced that a significantly higher response rate
to MPDL3280A was observed in smokers versus patients
that never smoked (26% versus 10%).
Another anti-PD-L1 antibody, MEDI4736,
entered early clinical testing recently in phase 1 trial
NCT01693562 and phase 1 NCT02000947 in combination
with tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antobody).

2.2 Vaccine interventions
Vaccine therapy has been studied for decades in
lung cancer, even though it is unlikely that stimulation
(even specific) of the immune system alone could be
sufficient to block growth of lung cancers. The concept is
that vaccines, made from proteins drawn from tumor cells
or from oncolytic viruses, can trigger the immune system
to develop memory and result in long-lasting responses
to present or future tumors. Several vaccines based on
different antigens are in trials for lung cancer, including
some in phase 3 [248, 249]. Antigen-specific vaccines that
are being clinically tested include melanoma-associated
antigen-A3, liposomal BLP-25, TG4010 (MUC-1
based), and recombinant human epidermal growth
factor (EGF). Other vaccines are cell-based, such as
belagenpumatucel-L.
MAGE-A3 is an antigen present on about 35%
of patients with NSCLC, and thus has been chosen as a
antigen in several vaccination studies. As is often the case
in immunotherapy trials, this strategy has shown few but
lasting responders [250]. A phase 3 trial, NCT00480025, is

Other immune therapies in development
Urelumab is a humanized agonistic monoclonal
antibody targeting the CD137 receptor, a member of the
TNF family of receptors, also known as 4-1BB. It has
potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities.
Urelumab specifically binds to and activates CD137expressing immune cells, stimulating an immune response
– in particular, a cytotoxic T cell response – against
tumor cells. An agonistic antibody, BMS-663513, was in

ongoing for patients who have undergone tumor resection.
A gene- expression signature associated with response
to MAGE-A3 vaccination has been identified. The set
of genes whose expression was predictive of response
contained mainly immune-related transcripts such as in
the interferon-gamma pathways and specific chemokines.
This suggests that the tumor’s immune microenvironment
plays a major role in the patient’s clinical response [251].
L-BLP25 (Stimuvax) targets the exposed core
peptide of MUC1, a heterodimeric glycoprotein
overexpressed in lung cancers that is also overexpressed
in a number of epithelial cancers and is associated with
poor prognosis. L-BLP-25 is a liposomal formulation
of vaccine targeting MUC-1. Results from early trials
with L-BLP25 were encouraging, but the phase 3 trial
(Stimulating Targeted Antigenic Responses To NSCLC
[START]) in unresectable stage 3 patients did not meet
its primary endpoint of OS. One of the problems that
contributed to failure could be that patients were not
stratified based on expression of MUC-1. A companion
study (NCT01015443) that was being conducted in Asian
patients (INSPIRE: Cancer Vaccine Study for Stage
III, Unresectable, Non–small-cell Lung Cancer in the
Asian Population) is not completed yet. A trial involving
combination of BLP25 with Bevacizumab is ongoing for
inoperable patients with stage 3-4 NSCLC after receiving
chemo/radiotherapy (NCT00828009).
Trial NCT01383148 (phase 2/3) also studies MUC1-based vaccine TG4010 developed on the backbone of
vaccinia virus Ankara that was modified to express MUC1 and IL-2.

The DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine,
infused directly into lymph nodes, as a single agent or in
combination with sirolimus is being examined in clinical
trial NCT01522820 for various malignancies including
NSCLC. Eligible patients are either at high risk of
recurrence or have minimal residual disease.
HyperAcute/Lung (tergenpumatucel-L) is a vaccine
treatment consisting of genetically modified allogeneic
NSCLC cells bearing alpha-(1,3)-galactosyltransferase.
NewLink Genetics has completed phase 2 clinical study
NCT01774578 examining tergenpumatucel-L as a single
agent in previously treated NSCLC, where 8 of 28 patients
had stable disease for > 16 weeks, with one patient
surviving 50 months. Tergenpumatucel-L might also
have a sensitizing effect on chemotherapy, since patients
who received salvage chemotherapy after progressing
on tergenpumatucel-L had a better overall response to
treatments than patients who had not received prior
tergenpumatucel-L. The trial is now recruiting patients for
phase 3.

Indoleamine 2.3 dioxygenase (IDO).
IDO is an immune regulatory protein that suppresses
activity of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Cancer cells and
dendritic cells might produce increased levels of IDO in
a variety of cancers. IDO is targeted using inhibitors in
various cancers; recently a completed phase 1 vaccination
trial (NCT01219348) showed long-lasting clinical benefits
in almost half of patients with stage 3-4 NSCLC [252].

rEGF.

WT2725.

NCT01444118 is a phase 3 trial that continues
assessment of a vaccine composed of humanized
recombinant EGF in hope that the immune response
elicited will target circulating EGF in NSCLC patients and
prevent activation of EGFR on tumors.

Trial NCT01621542 examines activity of peptide
vaccine WT2725 derived from Wilms tumor protein that
is highly expressed in a variety of malignancies.
A pilot trial, NCT01349647, designed for patients
with SCLC after first-line chemotherapy, will test KLH
conjugates of GD2L, GD3L, Globo H, fucosyl GM1,
and N-propionylated polysialic acid, with the adjuvant
OPT-821. The moieties used in the vaccine are known
to be expressed in SCLC. Patients will be monitored for
immune response and levels of CTC.
Racotumomab is an anti-idiotype murine
monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific to P3 MoAb with
anti-metastatic effect. Racotumomab binds to the idiotype
region of P3 MoAb and functionally mimics the threedimensional structure of N-glycolyl ceramides of monosialyl lactose, the antigenic target of P3. As a result, this
anti-idiotype antibody may stimulate the host immune
system to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses
against tumor cells expressing NeuGc-GM3 gangliosides.

Telomerase.
Phase 3 trial NCT01579188 with telomerase-based
vaccine GV1001 showed a significant increase in PFS
in inoperable NSCLC patients who received chemo/
radiotherapy first. Increased PFS was observed only in
patients who developed GV1001-specific T cell memory
responses and IFNγ(high)/IL-10(low)/IL-4(low) cytokine
profiles. The long-term follow-up of responders from the
completed phase 2 trial demonstrated increased OS with
some long-term responders.

Allogeneic cell vaccines.

A randomized phase 2 trial (NCT01240447) and a phase
3 trial (NCT01460472) are currently being conducted in
Cuba for patients with advanced NSCLC concomitant
with best supportive care.

A randomized phase 1 trial NCT01433172 will test a
vaccine consisting of the irradiated GM.CD40L bystander
cells (K562 cells modified to express GM-CSF and
CD40L) and an equivalent number of allogeneic tumor
cells plus or minus CCL21 involved in recruitment of T
cells.

Vaccinia-virus-based inducers.
Vaccination is currently being analyzed in
mesothelioma patients in a phase 2 trial (NCT01569919)
with recombinant-modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral
vector encoding the 5T4 fetal oncoprotein (MVA-h5T4)
widely expressed in mesothelioma. The vaccine will be
administered prior to and concomitant with the accepted
chemotherapy regimen for mesothelioma (pemetrexed and
cisplatin).
Lucanix, or Belagenpumatucel-L, a vaccine
consisting of allogeneic NSCLC cells transfected with
an antisense plasmid to TGFα2 was in clinical trials
[253], with promising results, and is now in phase 3 trial
NCT00676507. FANG, a new generation of cell-based
vaccine, is an experimental autologous cell vaccine based
on harvested tumor cells modified to express shRNA
to Furin and express GM-CSF from one vector. Furin
suppression is expected to inhibit immunosuppressive
signaling through its targets TGFα1 and α2. Phase 1 trial
NCT01061840 testing FANG is designed for patients with
inoperable solid tumors of several different histologies
including lung.

DISCUSSION
This review aimed to summarize the current
understanding of molecular pathways in lung cancer, in
particular as related to their potential to be therapeutically
targeted. Lung cancer is in essence a collection of
diverse diseases, even though different histology does not
necessarily belie different molecular blueprints of tumors,
as is the case with large cell carcinoma. The latter was
recently shown to belong to either AC or SCLC group,
based on molecular alterations present in these tumors.
Molecular blueprints of tumors are emerging as definitive
determinants of the course of therapy to choose, even
though presumably not all driver mutations have been
identified in lung cancer, and many of the identified driver
mutations are currently not targetable.
Several oncogenic pathways are involved in lung
cancer, but most genetic alterations (with the exception
of TP53) are not highly recurrent in a majority of cases
within each histological type. For example, mutations
and translocations in receptor tyrosine kinases do not
account for the majority of cases of adenocarcinoma.
Nevertheless, the development of targeted therapies for the
inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinases has transformed
diagnosis and treatment of adenocarcinoma, whereas
similar advances have not yet been achieved in targeting
alternative oncogenic pathways in other types of lung
cancer. Tumor suppressors play a seemingly ubiquitous
role in lung cancer, but most of them remain elusive targets
for therapeutic intervention. Still, many of the pathways
involved in the development and progression of lung
cancers are currently targeted in numerous clinical trials.
Immune therapies – in particular, blockade of immune
checkpoints – have produced highly promising results
in clinical studies, and will remain a subject of intense
clinical investigations. It is anticipated that investigational
therapies and rational combinations thereof will lead to
major advances in improving outcomes for patients with
lung cancer.
Already the development of targeted and immune
therapies has transformed diagnosis and treatment of
lung cancer. Molecular testing for EGFR, EML4-ALK,
and KRAS has become a routine diagnostic procedure in
AC. Other forms of lung cancer lag behind in terms of
development of targeted therapies, but with many clinical
trials ongoing in SCC and SCLC this is bound to change.

ISCOMATRIX.
Trial NCT01258868 is examining autologous
tumor cell vaccination using ISCOMATRIX adjuvant
in combination with celecoxib in patients undergoing
surgery for lung cancer. ISCOMATRIX is a saponin-based
adjuvant that could be combined with various antigens to
induce antibody or T cell–based immune responses.

Dendritic cell vaccines.
An immunotherapy protocol involving metronomic
cyclophosphamide (mCTX) followed by vaccinations with
tumor-antigen-loaded, dendritic-cell-derived exosomes
(Dex) is in development in France. The agent mCTX
inhibits Treg functions, restoring T- and NK-cell-effector
functions, and combined with Dex is able to activate the
innate and adaptive immunity, according to the trial site
information (NCT01159288). Phase I trials showed the
safety and feasibility of Dex vaccines.
Autologous dendritic cells modified with adenovirus
– employed to express chemokine CCL21 involved
in recruitment of T cells – are used for vaccination
of previously treated stage 3-4 patients in trials
NCT00601094 and NCT01574222.

Genomic testing for personalized treatment of
lung cancer is now associated with improved survival,
likely due to getting targeted kinase inhibitors to the right
patients [1]. Patients whose tumors were genotyped had
28% better overall survival odds than those who couldn’t
get a molecular diagnosis for various reasons. Table 3
contains a list of drugs and their molecular targets that
are currently in clinical testing. If even a portion of these
drugs shows efficacy, much more effective management
of patients based on molecular profiles of their cancers
could be achieved.
Rapid advances in the field of targeted therapies in
cancer treatment might require an overhaul of the clinical
trial system. A recent example is the “Master Protocol”, a
new trial design resulting from a collaboration between a
genomic testing company, federal health and regulatory
agencies, pharmaceutical companies, multiple cooperative
groups and patient advocacy organizations. The Master
Protocol is a biomarker-driven, multi-drug, multi-arm,
multi-center phase 2/3–registration trial, in which a
comprehensive genomic testing platform will be used
for all patients to determine stratification into appropriate
target-specific arms of the trial. The protocol will enroll
patients with SQCC, and could be presumably adopted for
other types of cancer. The use of comprehensive genomic
testing rather than piecemeal testing for one mutation
at a time, and the availability in the Master Protocol
of multiple targeted drugs should greatly increase the
probability of patients to be really matched to a targeted
therapy.
The problem with targeted therapies is that most of
the time clinical responses to them are short-lived. The
mechanisms of resistance are multifaceted, and might
involve new resistance-conferring mutations in the target
protein itself (such as T790M in EGFR) or activate
lateral signal-transduction pathways via new mutations
or changes in the expression level of the key proteins.
The first type of resistance (“gatekeeper” mutations) is
currently approached by development of more potent
or irreversible inhibitors (such as CO 1686 and other
investigational drugs for EGFR-T790M). The second type
of resistance is addressed by simultaneous targeting of two
or even more oncogenic proteins or pathways.
Immune therapies, in particular immune checkpoint
blockade, have shown a tremendous promise in clinical
trials for lung cancer. The responses to these tend to be
durable, but the problem is the heterogeneity of responses
from patient to patient. A lot of effort will be expended,
undoubtedly, into understanding the mechanisms that
contribute to durable responses in some patients and
lack of the responses in other patients with the same
histological tumor subtype. It is very likely that tumor
microenvironment and a particular genetic blueprint play
a major role in modulation of immune responses, which
might necessitate combination treatments involving
targeted and immune therapies.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Development and advancement of new treatments
in lung cancer will depend on the widespread introduction
of comprehensive molecular diagnostic procedures and
encouraging patient enrollment in clinical trials; also on
reporting and comparing outcomes. In order to address
clinically the ever-important problem of inherent and
acquired resistance to targeted therapies, genomic analyses
of resistance are of utmost importance. The success of
immunotherapeutic approaches will depend on a better
understanding of the basic biology of immune responses
and, in particular, the role that tumor microenvironment
plays in shaping immune responses.
