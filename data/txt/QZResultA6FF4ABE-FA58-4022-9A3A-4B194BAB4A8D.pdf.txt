Abstract
Abiraterone acetate (ABI) is associated not only with a significant survival
advantage in both chemotherapy-naive and -treated patients with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but also with a delay in time to
development of Skeletal Related Events and in radiological skeletal progression. These
bone benefits may be related to a direct effect on prostate cancer cells in bone or to
a specific mechanism directed to bone microenvironment. To test this hypothesis we
designed an in vitro study aimed to evaluate a potential direct effect of ABI on human
primary osteoclasts/osteoblasts (OCLs/OBLs). We also assessed changes in bone
turnover markers, serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) and alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), in 49 mCRPC patients treated with ABI.
Our results showed that non-cytotoxic doses of ABI have a statistically significant
inhibitory effect on OCL differentiation and activity inducing a down-modulation of
OCL marker genes TRAP, cathepsin K and metalloproteinase-9. Furthermore ABI
promoted OBL differentiation and bone matrix deposition up-regulating OBL specific
genes, ALP and osteocalcin. Finally, we observed a significant decrease of serum CTX
values and an increase of ALP in ABI-treated patients.
These findings suggest a novel biological mechanism of action of ABI consisting
in a direct bone anabolic and anti-resorptive activity.

Introduction

biosynthesis inhibitor that potently and irreversibly blocks
Cyp17 resulting in virtually undetectable serum and
intratumoral androgen production in the adrenals, testes
and prostate cancer cells [2, 3]. In phase III studies in
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
patients, it was demonstrated that ABI treatment is
associated not only with a significant survival advantage
in both chemotherapy-naive and chemotherapy-treated
patients [4-6] but also, in docetaxel treated patients, with
a better pain control from skeletal metastases, a delay in
time to development SREs and in radiological skeletal
progression. More specifically, 25% of patients developed

Several anticancer agents directly influence
bone remodeling targeting specific bone cells such as
osteoclasts (OCLs), osteoblasts (OBLs), osteocytes
and, concomitantly, resulting in bone anabolic and anticatabolic therapeutic effects. In this context, a number of
bone-targeted agents are currently under preclinical and
clinical investigation such as c-Src inhibitors, integrins
inhibitors, cathepsin-K inhibitors, endothelin receptor
antagonists and WNT signaling pathway modulators [1].

a skeletal event in 9.9 months when treated with ABI and
4.9 months with placebo and time to first SRE was 25.0
months with ABI compared to 20.3 months with placebo
[4, 5]. These ABI effects on metastatic bone disease may
be secondary to a systemic control of the disease due to a
direct antitumor effect that, in turns, leads to a decrease of
cancer cells/OCLs/OBLs vicious circle or, alternatively,
to a specific action directed to bone microenvironment.
To test this second hypothesis we have designed a
translational study aimed to investigate a potential bone
direct effect of ABI in an in vitro model of human primary
OCLs/OBLs and in a prospective cohort of castration
resistant prostate cancer patients in which bone turnover
markers were assessed during ABI treatment.

osteoclast)] as well as its expression in the osteoblasts
was evaluated at day 0 (mesenchymal cells), day 14 (preosteoblast) and day 21 (mature osteoblast). Cyp17A1
was expressed during all phases of osteoclast/osteoblast
maturation with a significant increase of mRNA levels at
early stage of osteoclast differentiation (monocytes vs preOCL p < 0.0001; monocytes vs OCL p < 0.0001) (Fig. S1).
Conversely Cyp17a1 mRNA levels remained unchanged
during the osteoblast maturation process (Fig. S1).
During OCLs/OBLs differentiation Androgen Receptor
(AR) expression levels were also assessed because it was
shown by others a direct activity of steroids on bone cells
[7-12]. AR was expressed at different stages of osteoclast
differentiation with a significant decrease in the levels of
transcripts in the mature osteoclasts (monocytes vs OCL
p < 0.001). Similarly to what observed for Cyp17a1, AR
mRNA levels were stable during all the phases of OBLs
differentiation (Fig. S1).

ALP positivity (DMSO vs ABI 5 μM p = 0.035; DMSO
vs ABI 10 μM p = 0.30) (Fig. 2A). Osteoblast ability to
produce bone matrix was analyzed only in presence of
androgen since steroid deprivation made cells unable
to induce calcium phosphate deposits. ABI increased
significantly bone matrix deposition stained by Alizarin
red assay (DMSO vs ABI 5 μM p = 0.026; DMSO vs ABI
10 μM p = 0.014) (Fig. 2A). These data demonstrated
that, unlike osteoclasts, osteoblasts require a source of
steroids to reach the complete differentiation, although
ABI treatment results in a partial differentiation rescue in
the steroid- depleted condition suggesting an androgenindependent anabolic effect of ABI. Indeed following
ABI administration the percentage of ALP+ osteoblasts
was significantly increased compared to control (DMSO
vs ABI 5 μM p = 0.018; DMSO vs ABI 10 μM p = 0.020)
as shown in Fig. 2B.

Effect of ABI on osteoclast/osteoblast markers

osteoclast viability excluding a possible cytotoxic effect
(Fig. S3). ABI was added to osteoclast cell cultures every
3 days and osteoclast differentiation was evaluated at the
end of the differentiation protocol (day 12) by functional
TRAP assay. ABI treatment had a statistically significant
inhibitory effect on osteoclast maturation reducing
the number of mature TRAP+ osteoclasts compared
with control (DMSO) (DMSO vs ABI 5 μM p < 0.05;
DMSO vs ABI 10 μM p < 0.001; ABI 5 μM vs ABI 10
μM p = 0.032) (fig.1A). The effect of ABI treatment on
osteoclastic activity was tested by seeding monocytes on
wells coated with inorganic calcium phosphate to mimic
bone matrix and evaluating the reabsorbed areas (pits)
produced by osteoclasts at the end of the differentiation
protocol. ABI significantly inhibited bone resorption
interfering with osteoclast function (DMSO vs ABI 5 μM
p < 0.0001; DMSO vs ABI 10 μM p < 0.0001; ABI 5 μM
vs ABI 10 μM p = 0.020) (fig.1A). Moreover, the effect
of ABI on osteoclast differentiation and activity was also
assessed using a charcoal-treated serum to deplete the
steroid content in the culture medium. In this deprivation
status the rate of mature osteoclasts significantly increased
as well as the ability of these cells to reabsorb bone matrix
(p < 0.001) (Fig. S2). In such deprivation model, TRAP
and resorption assay confirmed the anti-resorptive action
of ABI suggesting an androgen-independent inhibitory
mechanism (Fig. 1B).

Compared to baseline values, ABI significantly
down-modulated osteoclast markers such as TRAP (p
< 0.001), cathepsin-K (P < 0.001), MMP-9 (P = 0.015)
and up-regulated the expression of osteoblast’ ALP (p =
0.015) and osteocalcin (p = 0.034) genes both in presence
and absence of steroids (Fig. 3A and 3B). The reduction
of cathepsin-K levels and the increase of osteocalcin
expression were confirmed by Western Blot analyses (Fig.
3A and 3B).

Effect of ABI on bone turnover markers in
prostate cancer patients
Forty-nine consecutive patients were recruited.
Eighteen of them have the last follow up visit 10 months
after the end of treatment. Patients’ characteristics are
reported in Table 1. Median age was 67 years. Sixteen
of them had Gleason Score (GS)=7, six GS<7, twentythree GS>7. 16 patients had bone metastases, 18 patients
bone and lymph nodes metastases, 9 patients lymph nodes
metastases, 3 patients bone and visceral metastases, 1
patient visceral metastases, 1 patient bone metastases and
local recurrence, 1 patient bone, lymph nodes and visceral
metastases. Twenty patients started zoledronic acid at least
three months before beginning ABI treatment. The median
number of zoledronic acid doses before ABI therapy was
12.
A significant decrease in CTX values was observed:
at baseline the median value was 0.86 ng/mL (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-1.25), and at three, six and
nine months it was 0.78 ng/mL (95%CI: 0.67-1.01) (p =
0.077), 0.61 ng/mL (95%CI: 0.73-1.19) (p = 0.027) and
0.66 ng/mL (95%CI: 0.38-0.71) (p = 0.006), respectively
(Table 2, Fig. 4). Compared to median value at baseline

in improving multiple skeletal disease specific clinical
endpoints as recently documented in the context of phase
III clinical trials. Molecules that simultaneous target
prostate cancer cells and bone microenvironment could
significantly influence future therapeutic approaches in
order to achieve a better disease control and management
of prostate cancer bone metastases. If further prospective
confirmation will be obtained these pivotal results justify
a potential synergistic effect of ABI with bone-targeted
therapies (bisphosphonates and denosumab).
In conclusion, these findings represent the first
evidence of a novel mechanism of ABI directed on bone
microenvironment together with the known antitumoral
effect on CRPC cells and pave the way to new treatment
scenarios for bone metastatic prostate cancer.

Discussion
The results of the present study demonstrate for the
first time a direct bone anabolic and an anti-resorptive
effect of ABI both in vitro and in castration resistant
prostate cancer patients. Indeed, ABI is able to specifically
modulate osteoclast/osteoblast differentiation without
generating any cytotoxic and/or proliferative effect at the
administrated doses. Moreover, our findings show that
ABI regulates gene expression in bone cells modulating
mRNA levels of key osteoclastic/osteoblastic genes.
Intriguingly, we observed that anabolic and anti-resorptive
effects are produced both in presence and absence of
steroids suggesting a non-canonical mechanism of action
that seems to be, at least in part, androgen-independent.
Recently Bruno et al. reported about an alternative
mechanism analyzing the effect of ABI and other specifc
CyP17 inhibitors in an androgen-independent prostate
cancer cell line (PC-3) [16]. The treatment induced a
rapid release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) resulting in disruption of calcium homeostasis.
This, in turns, led to the ER stress response (ERSR), also
known as “unfolded protein response” (UPR) through the
phosphorylation of the translation elongation factor eIF2α
and the up-regulation of stress response genes, triggering
cell cycle arrest. Moreover, recent evidences showed
that eIF2α phosphorylation promotes the activation of
ATF4, a key osteoblastic transcriptional factor, leading to
osteocalcin up-regulation and down-modulation of a key
pro-osteoclastic factor, NFATc1, resulting in bone matrix
production [17]. Taken together these data suggest a novel
potential molecular mechanism of ABI that, acting through
eIF2α phosphorylation, may promote osteoblastogenesis
and inhibit osteoclast-dependent bone resorption. These
promising in vitro results provided a strong rationale to
design a translational study to investigate the potential
modulation of serum bone turnover markers by ABI
treatment in a cohort of 49 metastatic castration resistant
prostate cancer patients (mCRPC). Our findings showed
that in these patients ABI significantly inhibited bone
resorption as documented by a decrease of serum CTX
values and enhanced new bone formation as shown by an
increase of ALP in agreement with in vitro data.
Overall, our pre-clinical and clinical data provide a
biological rationale for the high efficacy of ABI treatment

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary cell culture
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated from buffy-coat of 10 male healthy
donors by Lympholyte®-H density gradient (Cedarlane
Laboratories) and monocytes were sorted using beads
conjugated anti-human CD14 (Miltenyi Biotech) and
cultured for 12 days in RPMI culture medium (Euroclone)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone,
Thermo Scientific) or 10% charcoal stripped serum
(Sigma-Aldrich), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml
streptomycin (Euroclone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Euroclone),
25 ng/mL macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)
and 50 ng/mL receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B
ligand (RANKL) (R&D Systems) to differentiate them
into osteoclast. During the differentiation protocol (from
day 1 to 12), cells were treated with 5-10 µM of ABI
acetate (Selleckem) or vehicle as control.
Primary human osteoblasts were differentiated from
human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) gently gifted by
Cell Culture Laboratory, Department of Biomedicine and
Prevention of the University Tor Vergata, Rome. HMSCs
were cultured for 21 days in alpha MEM (Euroclone)
supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum or 15%
charcoal stripped serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100
mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM betaglycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 µM ascorbic acid
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 nM dexamethasone (SigmaAldrich). During the differentiation protocol (from day 1
to 21), cells were treated with 5-10 µM of ABI acetate or
vehicle as control.
All culture media, growth factors, cytokine and ABI
acetate were replaced every 3-4 days [18-19].

samples using the ΔCT calculation. Subsequently relative
expression levels in treated samples were normalized to
the mRNA levels detected in control samples using the
ΔΔCT calculation [21].

At the end of the differentiation protocol (day 12)
culture medium was removed and cells were fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 5 minute and stained with leukocyte
acid phosphatase (TRAP) kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Stained positive cells (>3
nuclei) were then counted [20].
Osteoclasts activity was assessed culturing cells
on plates coated with a synthetic inorganic bone mimetic
matrix (Osteoassay, Corning). At day 12 the culture
medium was removed and plates were filled with sodium
hypochlorite solution to evaluate the ability of mature
osteoclasts to reabsorb this substrate; pits produced by
osteoclasts re-absorptive activity were quantified by
ImageJ software.

intensity.

Osteoblast functional assays
On day 21 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde
for 5 minute and stained with alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. ALP positivity was quantified by ImageJ
software.
In order to detect bone matrix deposition as a
marker of osteoblastic activity cells were fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 20 minute and stained with
alizarin red for 1 hour at room temperature. Alizarin red
fluorescence was detected at 470 nm and quantified by
spectrofluorimeter (Tecan Infinite M200Pro) [19].

Patients

Cell viability was evaluated by cell growth
determination kit, MTT-based assay (Sigma-Aldrich),
and performed according to manufacturer’s instructions;
the optical density (OD) of the colored complex formed
was read by spectrophotometer with 570 nm wavelength
and background absorbance at 690 nm wavelength was
subtracted.

Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC) with or without bone metastases in
clinical progression following treatment with docetaxel
and enrolled in the ABI acetate expanded access program
at the Division of Medical Oncology-S. Luigi Hospital,
Orbassano were prospectively assessed. ABI acetate was
administered at the dose of 1.000 mg daily with prednisone
5 mg twice a day in combination with luteinizing
hormone releasing hormone analogue until radiological or
serological progression. A subgroup of patients was also
treated with zoledronic acid at standard unchanged doses
in the last three months before starting ABI. All patients
were evaluated for bone formation and resorption.
Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as a marker
of osteoblast activity and serum c-telopetide of type-I
