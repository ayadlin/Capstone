in the Antiretroviral Therapy Era: Analysis of the National
Cancer Data Base
Adam J. Olszewski MD1; Jaleh Fallah MD2; and Jorge J. Castillo MD3,4

BACKGROUND: Antiviral therapy has altered the prognosis of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but patterns of lymphoma-directed therapy in the community are unknown. METHODS: The authors analyzed the National Cancer Data Base records of 10,769 patients who were diagnosed with HIV-associated lymphoma from 2004
through 2012. Changes in clinical characteristics and chemotherapy delivery over time were evaluated. Factors that were associated
with not receiving chemotherapy were studied using multivariable logistic regression, reporting odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The proportion of black or Hispanic patients with HIV-associated NHL increased from 41% in 2004 to
55% in 2012 (P <.0001). Chemotherapy was received by 81% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 90% of those with Burkitt
lymphoma, 61% of those with primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and 35% of those with primary central nervous system lymphomas
(PCNSL). Between 2004 and 2012, this proportion increased only for patients with PCNSL (P <.00001). Chemotherapy was less likely
to be received by patients who were older, black, or without private insurance. It was delivered more frequently in hospitals designated as academic (OR for nonreceipt, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.92) or in hospitals that had 3 HIV-positive cases per year (OR, 0.71; 95%
CI, 0.58-0.86). Survival improved in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (P 5.007), Burkitt lymphoma (P 5.0002), and PCNSL
(P 5.019), but not in those with PEL (P 5.94). Receipt of chemotherapy in patients with PEL was not associated with better survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in chemotherapy delivery need attention, because a majority of HIV-positive patients with NHL in the
United States are now black or Hispanic. Higher volume centers were associated with an increased likelihood of chemotherapy administration. Survival gains in patients with PCNSL parallel an increase in chemotherapy use, supporting its role in therapy. [See Editorial

INTRODUCTION
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is 1 of the most serious complications of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of its aggressive course and need for intensive chemotherapy. Combination antiretroviral therapy (CART)
has enhanced clinicians’ ability to apply rituximab-containing curative regimens, thus changing the prognosis of patients
with HIV-associated NHL.1 This aggressive malignancy typically presents as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphoma (BL), primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), or rare entities that include primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and plasmablastic lymphoma.2 The histologic subtypes differ in prognosis and associated
phase of the HIV infection: PCNSL and PEL occur in severely immunocompromised individuals,3 whereas BL is more common among those with higher cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4 [T-helper]) cell counts.4 Indolent B-cell and T-cell lymphomas are often excluded from clinicopathologic series, although their incidence is also elevated among patients with HIV.5,6

Original Article

Population-based research on HIV-associated lymphoma is hampered by limited identification of cases in
cancer registries. Prior studies relied on pooled data from
clinical trials, observational cohorts of HIV-positive
patients (such as the one from Centers for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome [AIDS] Research Network of
Integrated Clinical Systems [CNICS]), or linkages
between cancer and HIV registries (the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study [HACM]).1,7-9 They demonstrated
decreasing incidence of HIV-associated NHL, improved
survival in the post-CART era, and an association between
survival and CD4 cell count, but did not assess the use of
chemotherapy in the community. Recent data indicate
disparities in cancer treatments among HIV-infected
patients that are particularly important in the setting of
curative chemotherapy for NHL.10
We hypothesized that the evolving epidemiology of
HIV/AIDS would alter clinical characteristics and chemotherapy delivery in HIV-associated lymphoma. Our
objectives were to compare recent trends in demographics,
chemotherapy use, and associated survival using a nationwide registry.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Cohort Selection

This study used de-identified data from the National
Cancer Data Base (NCDB) and was exempt from oversight of the institutional review board. The NCDB is a
joint project of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society. It collects registry records from >1500 facilities and
captures approximately 85% of all patients with lymphoma in the United States.11 Participating institutions
must collect survival data on >90% of known living
patients annually. The NCDB contains information
about cancer histology, staging, and the first course of
treatment, including chemotherapy. Since 2004, HIV status was recorded for patients with NHL, with the exception of mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome, which
were excluded from our study. We extracted data on
359,731 lymphomas diagnosed between 2004 and 2012.
We excluded 35,130 patients (including 5.6% of HIVpositive patients) who were treated entirely outside of the
reporting facility (for whom data collection was not
required), and 2751 from hospitals that never reported
HIV status on their patients.
Variables and Endpoints

NHL histology was assigned according to the World
Health Organization classification.12 We distinguished
2690

the following categories: DLBCL, BL, PCNSL, PEL, Bcell lymphoblastic, indolent B-cell lymphoma (follicular, mantle cell, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic, and
small lymphocytic lymphomas), T-cell lymphoma, and
unspecified lymphomas. Plasmablastic lymphoma
(N 5 269) and NHL arising from human herpesvirus8–positive, multicentric Castleman disease (N 5 46)
were distinguished only since 2010, so we grouped them
with unspecified NHL. Race/ethnicity was categorized
as white non-Hispanic, white Hispanic, black, and
Asian/other. Socioeconomic status was approximated by
median income in patients’ zip codes of residence
(linked from the American Community Survey) and by
individual health insurance status. Stage was assigned
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
schemas. The type of cancer program was designated by
the Commission on Cancer based on annual case volume
and available oncology services in the facility.11 Facility
case volume was calculated as the average number of
HIV-associated lymphomas per year.
Chemotherapy administration was recorded without details of specific drugs, doses, duration, or
response to treatment. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis until death or last
follow-up by the registry. OS was not reported for 2012
cases, and they were excluded from the survival analysis.
There were no data on CD4 cell counts, viral load,
opportunistic infections, CART, or virologic control.
The timing between the HIV and NHL diagnoses also
was unrecorded.
Statistical Methods

Trends in characteristics were described using crude case
numbers and proportions. Nonreceipt of chemotherapy
was studied in a multivariable, mixed-effects logistic
regression model, assuming a facility-specific random
intercept that corresponds to local propensity to administer chemotherapy. Trends in OS between the periods
2004 through 2006, 2007 through 2009, and 2010
through 2011 were assessed by jointly testing coefficients
from Cox models stratified by histology, sex, race, and
quartiles of age. The proportional hazard assumption was
verified using Schoenfeld residuals. Missing data (race,
2%; insurance, 2%; stage, 4%; B symptoms, 15%; receipt
of chemotherapy, 2%) were multiply imputed by chained
equations, creating 20 imputed data sets. Proportions of
patients receiving chemotherapy, coefficients, and standard errors for regression models were then averaged using
Rubin rules, incorporating uncertainty resulting from
data missing at random.13 Two-sided P values with an a

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Among 321,850 patients with NHL, 3.4% (10,769) were
HIV-positive. Patients who had negative (56%) or unrecorded (40.7%) HIV status had very similar clinical characteristics (Supporting Table 1; see online supporting
information). We grouped them as HIV-negative, because
cancer registry flagging correctly identifies the majority of
HIV-associated lymphomas,14 and because this method
was used in previous population-based studies to account
for patients who did not get tested for HIV.5,15 We validated this approach by repeating all relevant comparisons
for only unequivocally HIV-positive or HIV-negative
patients, with consistent results (data not shown). On average, HIV-positive patients were younger (median age, 47
years; interquartile range, 40-55 years), more often male,
nonwhite, uninsured or with Medicaid insurance (indicating poverty or disability), and resided in poorer areas
(Table 1). Their lymphomas were characterized more often
by advanced stage or B symptoms. The most common histologies were DLBCL (47%), BL (15%), unspecified NHL
(13%), indolent B-cell lymphomas (10%), and PCNSL
(9%). Patients with PEL were almost exclusively male, and
those with PCNSL included the highest proportion of
black (43%) and white Hispanic (18%) individuals (Supporting Table 2; see online supporting information).
Trends in Clinical Characteristics

Between 2004 and 2012, the number of reported HIVassociated lymphomas decreased from 1329 to 896 per
year (Fig. 1a). The median age did not change during this
period, but the proportion of men increased from 75% to
81%. The decline in cases was significantly larger
(by > 50%, from 729 to 357 cases) among white nonHispanic patients compared with white Hispanic patients
(17% decrease, from 178 to 147) and black patients (7%
decrease, from 374 to 348; P < .00001). Consequently, in
2012, 50% of men and 77% of women with HIVassociated lymphoma were black or Hispanic. Such shifts
were not evident in the HIV-negative cohort.
The decline in HIV-associated lymphomas was
most pronounced for DLBCL, PCNSL, indolent B-cell,
and T-cell histologies (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the number
of BL cases (167 in 2004 vs 170 in 2012) remained relatively unchanged, thus significantly increasing the proportion of BL from 13% to 19% (P < .00001).
Delivery of Chemotherapy

Altogether, 74% of HIV-positive patients received chemotherapy. This proportion varied by histology: it was 81%

for DLBCL, 90% for BL, 61% for PEL, but only 35% for
PCNSL. Furthermore, chemotherapy was delivered to
70% of patients with T-cell lymphoma, 64% of those
with indolent B-cell lymphoma, and 64% of those with
unspecified lymphomas. Among HIV-negative patients,
these proportions were similar for those with DLBCL
(83%) and BL (89%), lower for those with PEL (49%),
and twice as high for those with PCNSL (70%;
P < .00001). Between 2004 and 2012, the proportion of
HIV-positive patients who received chemotherapy did
not change significantly for those with DLBCL, BL, or
PEL, whereas it increased significantly for those with
PCNSL after 2009 (Fig. 2).
We evaluated the factors associated with nonreceipt of
chemotherapy among HIV-positive patients with DLBCL

ment (Table 2). In a multivariable model, the odds of not
receiving chemotherapy increased with age and were higher
in patients who were black, without private insurance, had
DLBCL (rather than BL), or had stage I lymphoma. The
risk was significantly lower in hospitals that were designated
as academic/research institutions and those that reported
3 HIV-associated NHL cases per year. These higher volume facilities constituted 7.5% of 1340 unique cancer programs but cared for 46% of HIV-positive (and 19% of
HIV-negative) patients. They were more commonly located
in metropolitan counties with a population of >1 million
(72% vs 45%, P 5 .00003), and proportionally treated
more black patients (14% vs 6%) or Hispanic patients
(10% vs 5%; P < .00001). A statistically significant variation in chemotherapy use between individual hospitals was
confirmed by a positive intraclass correlation.

Survival Outcomes

OS was analyzed for 4 classic HIV-associated lymphomas:
DLBCL, BL, PCNSL, and PEL (Fig. 3a). The median
follow-up among censored patients was 4 years (interquartile range, 2-6 years). The median OS was 2 years
(95% CI, 1.8-2.4 years) for DLBCL, 2.2 years (95% CI,
1.4-3.5 years) for BL, 0.3 years (95% CI, 0.26-0.33 years)
for PCNSL, and 0.4 years (95% CI, 0.2-0.7 years) for
PEL. Estimates at 5 years were 42% (95% CI, 41%-44%)
for DLBCL, 45% (95% CI, 42%-48%) for BL, 22%
(95% CI, 19%-25%) for PCNSL, and 28% (95% CI,
19%-37%) for PEL. Respective estimates in the HIVnegative cohort were 54%, 52%, 29%, and 10%.
Survival was better among HIV-positive patients who
received chemotherapy (Fig. 3b), with a median OS of 4.1
years (95% CI, 3.3-4.8 years) for DLBCL, 3.9 years (95%
CI, 2.4-5.7 years) for BL, 1.5 years (95% CI, 0.8-3.1 years)
for PCNSL, and 0.7 years (95% CI, 0.4-1.1 years) for PEL.
The OS rate at 5 years was 48% (95% CI, 46%-49%) for
DLBCL, 48% (95% CI, 45%-51%) for BL, 40% (95%
CI, 34%-47%) for PCNSL, and 28% (95% CI, 17%41%) for PEL. Those estimates were significantly higher
compared with those for patients who did not receive
chemotherapy in all subtypes except PEL (28% with and
25% without chemotherapy) (Supporting Table 3; see
online supporting information). In the trend analysis, OS
significantly improved for patients with DLBCL, BL, and
(after 2009) for PCNSL, whereas no improvement was detectable for those with PEL (Fig. 3c-f).
DISCUSSION
In this comprehensive study, which included the majority
of HIV-associated lymphomas in the United States from
Cancer

September 1, 2016

2004 to 2012, we demonstrated significant shifts in epidemiology, the application of chemotherapy, and survival.
Receipt of chemotherapy varied by histology, sociodemographic features, and type of treating hospital. These findings are important, because most Americans with HIVassociated lymphoma are now black or Hispanic, and the
ability to deliver chemotherapy closely correlates with survival outcomes.
Proportions of racial/ethnic subgroups mirror the
incidence of HIV in the United States. Blacks constituted
13% of the country’s population in 2013, but they
accounted for 42% of new HIV infections among men
and 63% among women.16 The incidence of HIVassociated lymphoma has decreased overall since the
1990s, although prior studies did not analyze it in racial
subgroups.9 We observed an uneven decline, which was
markedly more pronounced in the white non-Hispanic
population, possibly reflecting disparities in patients’
immune status, considering the higher rate of virologic
failure on CART among blacks.17 Similar shifts in proportions of different races are evident in HIV-associated
Hodgkin lymphoma.18 Compared with our more recent
data, the HACM study (1996-2010) demonstrated a similar proportion of DLBCL (50%), but less BL (9%), and
more PCNSL (16%).6 The CNICS study (1996-2010)
reported an increasing proportion of BL over time, but
our data indicated that this was because of a reciprocal
decrease in DLBCL and other subtypes rather than an
increase in BL.8
We also placed survival outcomes in the context of
chemotherapy application, although chemotherapy use
was only identified as a binary variable, without distinguishing specific regimens. The HACM researchers

previously demonstrated higher rates of nontreatment
among HIV-positive individuals with various cancers.10
Another registry-based case-control study indicated a high
risk of dose reductions in lymphoma chemotherapy.19
Advanced immunodeficiency, AIDS-related infections,
and comorbidities are among the barriers to administering
curative systemic regimens in patients with HIVassociated lymphoma. Because rituximab-containing
2694

chemotherapy exhibited high toxicity among patients with
low CD4 cell counts in the initial randomized trial, clinicians were hesitant about using immunochemotherapy in
the HIV-positive population.20 Subsequent studies demonstrated safety of this approach in less compromised
patients,21,22 and rituximab repeatedly conferred survival
benefits for HIV-positive patients who had CD20expressing NHL.23,24 We observed no change in the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy for DLBCL and
BL between 2004 and 2012, whereas OS improved during
that period. Better management of HIV itself, including
access and adherence to CART, and better supportive care
likely contribute to these favorable trends. An advantage
may also be in the quality of chemotherapeutic regimens,
because the application of novel infusional regimens is associated with better OS.22,24,25 We corroborated no significant difference in survival between patients with DLBCL
and BL, as previously suggested in the CNICS report (44%
and 50% at 5 years, respectively) and in a German observational study (63% and 69% at 2 years, respectively).8,26
We observed a significant association between
receipt of chemotherapy for HIV-associated lymphoma
and certain patient-specific and hospital-specific factors.
We acknowledge a lack of important confounders in the
NCDB (the presence of AIDS, CART, performance status, and psychosocial barriers to treatment) that limited
the interpretation of our findings. Substance abuse, homelessness, and mental health disorders are prevalent among
individuals with HIV and influence their health outcomes.27-29 Advanced immunodeficiency may correlate
with race or insurance-related disparities, although cancer
treatment was less likely among black patients even after
adjustment for CD4 count and the mode of HIV transmission in the HACM study.10 Sociodemographic disparities in treatment and survival have been widely reported
in patients with HIV-negative lymphomas.30,31 A study
focused on adolescents and young adults suggested that
racial disparities in NHL survival were attenuated after
excluding HIV-positive patients from the cohort.32 Our
study highlights the importance of addressing correctible
disparities in a disease in which the majority of patients
are black or Hispanic and thus vulnerable to both HIVrelated and socioeconomic barriers to curative cancer therapy. Cancer programs could streamline their patient navigation resources, expand psychosocial support services,
and focus on coordination of care to assure that HIVpositive patients with lymphoma can receive curative
chemotherapy as well as CART. An additional novel finding is that nonreceipt of chemotherapy was nearly 30%
less likely for patients who received treatment at

institutions that treated 3 HIV-associated lymphomas
per year, even after adjustment for the academic/community setting. Although higher volume centers care disproportionally for metropolitan minority populations,
clinicians’ experience, availability of supportive services,
and infectious disease expertise in the management of
interactions between CART and chemotherapy all may
contribute to better delivery of cancer treatment. We cannot rule out self-selection of healthier patients to receive
care at academic hospitals, so additional research on
potential confounding characteristics in various settings is
needed. It is noteworthy that, in a recent British report
focused on university hospitals, the survival of HIVpositive patients with DLBCL was actually marginally
better than that for HIV-negative patients.33 Centralization of care might have benefits, but we should point out
that it may also create an additional burden for vulnerable
patients because of the need for referral or travel, posing a
risk of undesirable diagnostic or treatment delay.
We distinguished outcomes for PCNSL and PEL—
2 less common, yet problematic subtypes driven by oncogenic viruses.34 PCNSL occurs in individuals with
advanced AIDS and is often treated using radiation therapy alone or with supportive care only because of patients’
poor clinical condition.2,35 We observed increased use of
chemotherapy in patients with PCNSL after 2009 that
was paralleled by increased OS during that period,
although expanded use of CART may have caused those
gains too, especially because remissions of HIV-associated
PCNSL with CART alone have been reported.36 Survival
curves for patients with PCNSL largely overlapped with
the curves for those for PEL in the overall cohort, yet the
OS of patients with PCNSL who received chemotherapy
was closer to the OS of those with DLBCL/BL, generating
a hypothesis that the administration of systemic treatment
may translate into better outcomes. In line with this, current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines
advocate high-dose methotrexate for all HIV-positive
patients who have PCNSL, regardless of performance or
immune status,37 although only prospective research can
firmly establish the advantage of this approach. In contrast, outcomes in PEL remain poor regardless of chemotherapy receipt and without any evident trend,
highlighting the inadequacy of currently available
modalities.38
Our analysis, which relied on cancer registry data,
has several additional limitations. The NCDB reports
only information from accredited cancer programs, so it is
not completely population-based and does not allow a calculation of standard epidemiologic measures like inci2696

dence rates, which limited us to a study of crude numbers
and proportions.39 In addition, as a hospital-based registry, the NCDB may not capture patients treated in private
practices, restricting the scope of our analysis. Records of
immune status or CART treatment were lacking, in contrast to the CNICS or HACM cohorts. An advantage of
our analysis was the ability to study chemotherapy administration in various types of lymphoma, although it would
be of further interest to discern treatment regimens, particularly infusional chemotherapy or rituximab use.
Because CD4 counts, the presence of AIDS, and exposure
to CART are critical confounders of OS in patients with
HIV-associated lymphomas,1,8,40,41 we could not reliably
analyze prognostic factors for survival in multivariable
models. Response to treatment, cause of death, and
progression-free survival also were unavailable in this
data set.
In conclusion, most HIV-positive patients with
newly diagnosed DLBCL and BL in the United States
receive active chemotherapy. OS has increased over the
past decade for these patients and does not differ between
DLBCL and BL. Significant sociodemographic disparities
in treatment delivery need to be addressed in view of the
evolving epidemiology. Centralized care may be advantageous in patients with HIV-associated lymphoma considering the correlation of hospital case volume with
chemotherapy delivery. PEL continues to be characterized
by a markedly worse prognosis and uncertain benefit of
standard chemotherapy. Finally, US cancer registries
should continue to record the HIV status of patients with
NHL or even expand the scope of collected data to enable
ongoing epidemiologic surveillance and health outcomes
research in this population.
