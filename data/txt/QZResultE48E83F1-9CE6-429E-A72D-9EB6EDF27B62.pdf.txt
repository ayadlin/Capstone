Abstract
RECQL1 and WRN proteins are RecQ DNA helicases that participate in suppression of DNA hyperrecombination and repair. In this study, we report evidence supporting their candidacy as cancer therapeutic
targets. In hypopharyngeal carcinomas, which have the worst prognosis among head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC) that are rapidly rising in incidence, we found that RECQL1 and WRN proteins are highly
expressed and that siRNA-mediated silencing of either gene suppressed carcinoma cell growth in vitro. Similarly,
siRNA administration in a murine xenograft model of hypopharyngeal carcinoma markedly inhibited tumor
growth. Moreover, combining either siRNA with cis-platinum (II) diammine dichloride significantly augmented
the in vivo anticancer effects of this drug that is used commonly in HNSCC treatment. Notably, we observed no
recurrence of some tumors following siRNA treatment in this model. Our findings offer a preclinical proof of
concept for RECQL1 and WRN proteins as novel therapeutic targets to treat aggressive HNSCC and perhaps
other cancers. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4598–607. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Two-thirds of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) cases have locally advanced lesions with or without
regional lymph node involvement (1). Despite recent advances
in therapeutic procedures, the 5-year survival rate for patients
with HNSCC has remained 50% or less for the past few decades
(2). Hypopharyngeal carcinoma has one of the worst prognoses among HNSCCs, and the 5-year survival rate is approximately 30% to 35% (3). Hypopharyngeal carcinoma is
prominently invasive, and total pharyngolaryngectomy, which
is the curative surgical treatment, causes serious functional
problems that include vocal, swallowing, and chewing disorders (4). In addition, hypopharyngeal carcinoma often
metastasizes to lymph nodes or distant organs, and therefore
innovations to improve disease survival and larynx preservation are needed.
The RecQ family helicases participate in prevention of
hyper-recombination and repair of DNA, and are highly upregulated in transformed cells and tumor cells (5, 6). Partial

functional redundancy among 5 RecQ helicases is possible, but
they cannot completely substitute each other. Each helicase
plays a distinct role for DNA repair (7–9), and further causes
different mutational diseases: dysfunction of WRN, BLM, and
RTS helicases cause Werner, Bloom, and Rothmund–Thomson syndromes, respectively. Notably, only WRN helicase
possesses an exonuclease activity (10). RECQL1 and WRN
proteins are members of the RecQ helicase family and play an
important role in maintenance of genomic stability (5, 11–14).
RECQL1 functions as a Holliday junction–resolving enzyme
and is involved in a mismatch-repair pathway; and the defect
is possibly linked to tumorigenesis of colorectal cancers (15).
RECQL1-deficient mice are sensitive to ionizing radiation (14),
but can grow without any apparent abnormalities. The
RECQL1 silencing by siRNA induces cancer cell–specific cytotoxicity (5, 16), and is effective in reduction of tumor growth in
carcinoma cells originating from lung, hepatic, pancreatic, and
colon carcinomas (16). The effect of RECQL1-siRNA is suggested to be affected by (i) the speed of cell-cycle progression,
(ii) the checkpoint status, such as p53 mutations, and (iii)
levels of expressed contents of RECQL1 (16). WRN also
participates in DNA dynamics such as nonhomologous end
joining, homologous recombination, and base-excision repair
(6, 11, 17). WRN functions at telomeres during the S-phase and
replication of G-rich telomeric DNA (18). WRN functional loss
causes telomeric loss without lagging-strand replication (19).
WRN-deficient cells are hypersensitive to camptothecin and
4NQO (20), but can grow without any apparent abnormalities
(20, 21). The modification of the expression of the WRN gene is
known to affect growth in colorectal tumors and the effect of
anticancer drugs (11, 22). Recently, it was reported that
inhibition of WRN helicase activity impaired cell growth

and proliferation, induced apoptosis in a WRN-dependent
manner, and resulted in elevated g-H2A.X and proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) foci (23).
Because hypopharyngeal carcinomas show a high growth
activity, they are expected to express high levels of RecQ family
proteins, suggesting that RECQL1 and WRN could be potential
therapeutic targets. Therefore, we examined whether RECQL1
and WRN are highly expressed in hypopharyngeal carcinomas,
whether RECQL1-siRNA or WRN-siRNA has an inhibitory
effect on hypopharyngeal cancer cell growth in vitro and in
vivo, and whether the combined therapy with cis-platinum (II)
diammine dichloride (CDDP) and either siRNA could enhance
the anticancer effect in vivo. In addition, this study discusses
the mechanisms of in vivo cancer cell death caused by the
combined treatments with CDDP and siRNA.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures
The cancer cell lines, FaDu, D-562 (hypopharyngeal carcinoma), HeLa (endocervical carcinoma), MCF7, T47D, and
SKBr3 (breast carcinoma) were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection. TIG-108 human normal fibroblast
was from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources.
These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium or RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. All cell culture
media were supplemented with penicillin (50 units/mL) and
streptomycin (50 mg/mL). These cell lines were incubated at
37 C in a humidified chamber supplemented with 5% CO2.
WST-8 assay
FaDu, D-562, MCF7, T47D, and TIG-108 cells were cultured
in 96-well plates, and cell viability assays were carried out by a
Cell Counting Kit-8 (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan). WST-8
reagent solution was added to each well, and the absorbance
at 450 nm (OD450) was then measured by a microplate reader
after the microplate was incubated with the reagent for 3 hours
at 37 C, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
Protein extractions and Western blot analysis
The expressed proteins of each cell line were analyzed
by immunoblotting. Cells were ruptured in ice-cold lysis
buffer (40 mmol/L HEPES, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 10 mmol/L pyrophosphate,
10 mmol/L glycerophosphate, 50 mmol/L NaF, 0.5 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and containing the protease inhibitor). Cell extracts were kept on ice for 20 minutes and
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes (4 C). The supernatants were boiled with SDS sample buffer. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride filters. After blocking of the filters with TBS-T
[10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween
20] containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the filters
were incubated for 1 hour with the primary antibodies in TBST containing 2% BSA at 4 C. The filters were then washed in
TBS-T and incubated for 30 minutes in horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (GE Healthcare) diluted 1:10,000 in TBS-T containing 2% BSA. After

several washes with TBS-T, immunoreactivity was detected
by the ECL system (GE Healthcare) according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer.
Tissue samples and pathologic data
Fifty-two primary hypopharyngeal and 59 primary breast
cancer specimens were obtained by biopsy and surgical
resection, respectively, at Kyoto Prefectural University of
medicine from 1997 to 2008. Hypopharyngeal carcinomas
were all squamous cell carcinomas. The samples were
obtained from 5 women and 47 men with a median age of
65 years (range, 45–81 years). Four cases had stage I cancer, 4
cases had stage II, 4 cases had stage III, and 40 cases had stage
IV. Breast cancers were all invasive ductal carcinoma. All the
breast cancer samples were obtained from women with a
median age of 76 years (range, 27–86 years). Nine cases had
stage I cancer, 38 cases had stage II, 23 cases had stage III, and
1 case had stage IV. In this study, breast cancers were used as
one of the representatively mild malignancies, which have
been well controlled by the presently curative protocols and
have better prognosis than hypopharyngeal carcinomas. Data
were collected from clinical and pathologic records with the
written informed consent of individual patients and after
approval by the Ethics Committee of the institute.
Antibodies and reagents
Anti-WRN (4H12 or 8H3) and anti-RECQL1 (Q1N3) antibodies were reported previously (6, 17, 24), and provided from
GeneCare Institute (Kanagawa, Japan). Anti–a-tubulin (DM
1A), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Ab-4), anti–phospho-histone H2A.
X (g-H2A.X; 20E3), anti-anti-MPM-2 (FOXM1,0.T.181), and
anti-Ki67 (MM-1) were purchased from SIGMA, Oncogene
Research Products, Cell Signaling Technology, Abcam, and
Leica Microsystems, respectively. CDDP was provided by
NIPPON KAYAKU, dissolved with N,N-dimethylformamide,
and diluted 1:200 with purified water. The final concentration
of CDDP was 50 mg/mL. Lipofectamine RNAi MAX Reagent
was purchased from Invitrogen. Atelocollagen (AteloGene
Local Use) was purchased from KOKEN.
Immunohistochemistry
Surgical specimens were transferred to 10% buffered formalin and fixed overnight. The fixed samples were embedded
in paraffin and serially sliced into 4-mm sections. After dewaxing, sections were autoclaved at 120 C for 1 minute in 10
mmol/L sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0), and immersed in 0.3%
H2O2. They were then incubated overnight at 4 C with primary
antibodies to WRN (diluted 1: 500), RECQL1 (1:500), or g-H2A.
X (1:200). The sections were rinsed with 1 PBS and incubated
with the secondary antibody (Simple Stain MAX-PO; Nichirei)
at room temperature for 1 hour. The sections were then
colorized with 3.30 -diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride and
counterstained with hematoxylin. The stainings were evaluated by 2 blinded independent observers in all cases.
siRNA and WST-8 assays
GL3-, WRN-, and RECQL1-siRNA were provided by
GeneCare Institute (Kanagawa, Japan). Firefly luciferase gene

sequence GL3 is nonsilencing siRNA and was used as a negative control (16). siRNA sequences were as follows:
GL3, 50 -CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGATT-30 (sense), 50 -UCGAAGUACUCAGCGUAAGTT-30 (antisense); WRN, 50 -GUUCUUGUCACGUCCUCUGTT-30 (sense), 50 -CAGAGGACGUGACAAGAACTT-30 (antisense); RECQL1, 50 -GUUCAGACCACUUCAGCUUTT-30 (sense), 50 -AAGCUGAAGUGGUCUGAACTT-30 (antisense). We examined the silencing effect targeting
RECQL1 and WRN by transfecting 40 nmol/L of each siRNA
with Lipofectamine RNAi MAX reagents. Cells were ruptured
in ice-cold lysis buffer and proteins were extracted, as
described earlier in the text. The protein expressions were
examined by Western blot analysis. After confirming the
silencing effect of each siRNA, we carried out WST-8 assays.
Mice and xenografting of human hypopharyngeal
carcinomas
Eight- to 10-week-old BALB/c nu/nu nude mice (CLEA
Japan, Inc.) carrying FaDu or D-562 hypopharyngeal carcinoma
were used in the experiments. The use of the animals in the
experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the
Committee of Research Center for Animal Life Science in Shiga
University of Medical Science. The right dorsal flank of each
mouse was injected subcutaneously with 5.0  106 cells of each
type of cancer. After the establishment of palpable tumors
(approximately 100 mm3), mouse body weight and external
tumor volume were determined every 2 days. Tumor volume
was calculated by using the formula, A2  B/2, where A and B
represent the smallest and the largest diameters, respectively.
In vivo evaluation of tumor growth in mice treated with
siRNA targeting WRN or RECQL1 or with the
combination of CDDP with siRNA
Forty-eight mice carrying FaDu hypopharyngeal carcinoma
cells were randomized into 8 groups of 6 mice each; CDDP
and/or siRNA were administered to the mice on Days 0, 7, and
14. Either CDDP at a dose of 4.0 mg/kg (1,600 mL) or a similar
volume of PBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity of each
mouse. AteloGene and siRNA were mixed according to the
procedures recommended by the manufacturer and administered with siRNA dose 1.0 mg/kg/d around the tumors. Eight
experimental groups were as follows: PBS þ no siRNA (PBS þ
NC); PBS þ GL3-siRNA (PBS þ GL3); PBS þ RECQL1-siRNA
(PBS þ RECQL1); PBS þ WRN-siRNA (PBS þ WRN); CDDP þ
no siRNA (CDDP þ NC); CDDP þ GL3-siRNA (CDDP þ GL3);
CDDP þ RECQL1-siRNA (CDDP þ RECQL1); and CDDP þ
WRN-siRNA (CDDP þ WRN). Tumor specimens were dissected on day 18 and paraffin sections were prepared as
mentioned earlier in the text. The sections were immunohistochemically evaluated. The primary antibodies were directed
against Ki67 (diluted 1:50), cleaved caspase 3 (1:1,000), MPM-2
(1:500), and g-H2A.X. The percentage of positively stained
tumor cells (per 1,000 tumor cells) was calculated for each
antibody. The antitumor effect of each siRNA was also examined in D-562 xenografts. Twenty-four mice were randomized
into 4 groups of 6 mice each. The 4 intervention groups were
as follows: PBS þ NC; PBS þ GL3; PBS þ RECQL1; and PBS þ
WRN.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling assays
Apoptotic cells of the dissected tumor samples were
detected by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay by using
the In situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (TaKaRa) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Proteinase K was treated at a concentration of 20 mg/mL for 5 minutes. Detection was done by
using 3.30 -diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride and counterstained with methyl green. The apoptotic index (AI) was
assessed as the percentage of positively stained tumor cells
per a high-powered field.
Statistical analyses
All the data were analyzed statistically by Stat View 5.0 for
Windows (Stat View Inc.). OD450 of the WST-8 assay, xenografted tumor volume, and the percentage of positive cells for
each immunohistochemical or TUNEL assay were statistically
analyzed for differences among the therapeutic groups by
using 1-way factorial ANOVA and multiple comparison tests
accompanied by Fisher's significance. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
RECQL1 and WRN proteins are abundantly expressed in
hypopharyngeal carcinoma
The hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines, FaDu and D-562,
grew more rapidly than the breast carcinoma cell lines, MCF7
and T47D, and TIG-108 human fibroblast (Fig. 1A). The
expression levels of both WRN and RECQL1 proteins were
very high in FaDu and D-562, compared with those in HeLa. In
contrast, the expression levels in MCF7, T47D, SKBr3, and
TIG-108 were lower than those in HeLa (Fig. 1B). FaDu, D-562,
T47D, and SKBr3 showed mutant p53 accumulation (data not
shown). HeLa has been used as a blotting control; HeLa
expresses a high level of RECQL1 compared with normal cell
lines (5). Thus, hypopharyngeal cancer cells expressed abundant amounts of RECQL1 and WRN, whereas breast cancer
cells expressed them at a similar level to that of normal cells.
In addition, we confirmed the expressions of WRN and
RECQL1 proteins in clinical specimens. Both proteins were
strongly stained in hypopharyngeal cancer cells compared
with stromal fibroblasts, although they were less stained in
breast cancer cells (Fig. 1C). The rates of WRN-positive cells
were significantly higher in hypopharyngeal carcinoma
(92.7%) than those of breast cancers (59.8%; Mann–Whitney
U test, P < 0.0001). On the contrary, the mean RECQL1-positive
cell rates were not significantly different between them; 87.7%
and 78.9%, in hypopharyngeal and breast carcinoma (Mann–
Whitney U test, P ¼ 0.31), respectively (Fig. 1D). These
comparative findings were also confirmed among similar
tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages of both cancers (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Both WRN and RECQL1 proteins
were highly expressed, and expression of WRN was significantly higher than RECQL1 in hypopharyngeal carcinoma
(Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, P ¼ 0.0009; Supplementary
Fig. S1C). In breast carcinoma, however, RECQL1-positive

case-by-case variations (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, P ¼

We assessed the extent of DNA damage by staining with
anti–phospho-histone H2A.X (g-H2A.X) antibody in hypopharyngeal and breast carcinomas. Abundant g-H2A.X was
expressed in cell lines (FaDu and D-562; Supplementary
Fig. S2A) and clinical samples of hypopharyngeal carcinoma,
but not in cell lines and clinical samples of breast carcinoma

carcinoma and breast carcinoma: Student's t test, P ¼ 0.0061;

RecQ proteins are expressed at high levels probably to deal

As the expression levels of both RECQL1 and WRN were
very high in the hypopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines, these
proteins are expected to play important roles in the cancer cell
growth. The in vitro hypopharyngeal cancer cell growth was
assessed during treatment with RECQL1- and WRN-siRNA.

In vivo therapeutic effect of RECQL1- or WRN-siRNA
The antitumor effect of siRNA targeting RECQL1 or WRN
was assessed in nude mice carrying FaDu hypopharyngeal
carcinoma (Fig. 3A). Treatment with siRNA (1 mg/kg once a
week) targeting RECQL1 or WRN (PBS þ RECQL1 and PBS þ
WRN) suppressed tumor growth significantly during days 7
to 11 compared with the control treatment, PBS þ NC and

D-562 (1-way factorial ANOVA and multiple comparison tests
accompanied by Fisher's significance, P < 0.05). On the contrary, neither siRNA could effectively inhibit the growth of
MCF7, T47D, or TIG-108 cells (Fig. 2). These results suggested
that RECQL1 and WRN play important roles in cancer cell
growth, and therefore are potential targets for anticancer
therapy in hypopharyngeal carcinoma.

Moreover, we confirmed similarly the antitumor effect of each
siRNA in D-562 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Combined effect with CDDP and siRNA targeting
RECQL1 or WRN in vivo
In an attempt to maximize tumor cell death, we investigated in FaDu xenografts whether the combined therapy with
CDDP and siRNA targeting RECQL1 or WRN enhanced the
antitumor effect of the siRNA. This combination therapy was
highly effective in inhibiting tumor growth (Fig. 3C) and was
significantly different from the control treatment (PBS þ NC
and PBS þ GL3) and from the monotherapy with CDDP
(CDDP þ NC and CDDP þ GL3). The combination of
RECQL1-siRNA with CDDP was more effective than each of
the monotherapies. The combination of WRN-siRNA with
CDDP was the most effective in tumor growth suppression
(1-way factorial ANOVA and multiple comparison tests
accompanied by Fisher's significance, P < 0.05; Fig. 3C). The

RECQL1 and WRN: Therapeutic Targets in Head and Neck Cancer

MPM-2–positive cells from 5% to 15%–20%. CDDP induced
a marked increase in MPM-2 positivity, with all of the indices
at approximately 60% to 70%. In particular, the combined
therapy with CDDP and RECQL1-siRNA most strongly
increased the fraction of MPM-2–positive cells, with an index
of 82%.
Furthermore, because both CDDP and siRNA targeting the
RecQ family genes have been involved in causing DNA damage
of tumor cells, we investigated the extent of DNA damage with
g-H2A.X staining (Fig. 4C). The percentages of g-H2A.X–positive cells were low (3%) in control groups (PBS þ NC and
PBS þ GL3), but were more than 5% in all of the therapeutic
groups and maximally reached 16% in the CDDP þ RECQL1siRNA group. There were significant differences between
CDDP þ RECQL1-siRNA and all other groups (1-way factorial
ANOVA and multiple comparison tests accompanied by
Fisher's significance, P < 0.05).

Discussion
Normal cells avoid mitosis during the repair process of
damaged DNA at the G1 or G2 checkpoint of cell cycle. In
contrast, defects in G1 or G2 checkpoint are common in cancer
cells continuing cell proliferation in the presence of DNA
damage, failing in G2 arrest and leading to mitotic catastrophe
(5). Although defects in G2 checkpoint, including p53 mutation, lead to mitotic catastrophe, highly upregulated RecQ
helicases can salvage the cancer cells from DNA damage–
induced cell death, including mitotic catastrophe (19, 25–27).
Therefore, RECQL1 silencing can induce effective cell death in
some cancer models (5, 16).
HNSCC, especially hypopharyngeal carcinoma, grows
rapidly, suggesting that RecQ family proteins are expressed
abundantly. This study has supported this prediction. The
high growth rate and the high-level expressions of both
RECQL1 and WRN proteins in hypopharyngeal carcinomas
in comparison with breast carcinomas may be consistent with
the fact that hypopharyngeal carcinomas are more aggressive
and have clinically worse outcomes than breast carcinomas.
The expressions of both RECQL1 and WRN correlated with
g-H2A.X intensities in hypopharyngeal rather than breast
carcinomas, probably to deal with the DNA damage caused
by mitotic catastrophe.
A siRNA delivery system using liposome and/or collagenbased transfection method may be promising in HNSCC
therapy, because local administration and/or the arterial
infusion therapy with siRNA are possible to perform in
HNSCC. In contrast, in other internal malignancies, specific
and selective drug delivery is still difficult. In addition, siRNA
administration at 1.0 mg/kg, once a week, is actually suitable
for clinical application, and the administration protocol is
better than the protocol reported previously stating that three
times daily administration of RECQL1-siRNA (2 mg/kg) was
used (16). To obtain the individualized medicine, it is necessary to target the molecules adapted for each carcinoma, case
by case. As observed in this study, specific siRNAs targeting
individual molecules would be one of the best and simplest
options.

The mechanisms of cell death, including apoptosis, autophagy, mitotic catastrophe, and necrosis still remain to be
elucidated (28). Silencing of RECQL1 induces mitotic catastrophe (5), and CDDP is involved in apoptosis, mitotic
catastrophe, and necrosis (29–32). The data in this study were
mostly consistent with these reports, as described in the
following text.
The investigation of apoptosis with the TUNEL and cleaved
caspase 3 assays revealed that CDDP monotherapy did not
induce apoptosis in FaDu xenografts. Some reports showed
that CDDP is a cytotoxic agent that induces DNA damage
resulting in a very high percentage of necrotic cells and affects
apoptosis (32, 33). Vakifahmetoglu and colleagues (30) showed
that CDDP treatment led to apoptosis in the presence of a
functional wild-type p53, but mitotic catastrophe occurred in
the absence of functional p53. In this study, FaDu hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells harbor a mutant p53, and CDDP
induced nonapoptotic cell death, including mitotic catastrophe. RECQL1-siRNA did not activate the caspase pathway
by itself. However, when combined with CDDP, RECQL1siRNA strongly activated the caspase pathway and TUNELpositive apoptosis. Notably, the present observation is consistent with the previous report suggesting the role of RECQL1
in CDDP resistance (34). On the contrary, WRN-siRNA activated the caspase pathway and induced apoptosis by itself.
When combined with CDDP, WRN-siRNA did not additionally
enhance the caspase pathway and apoptosis.
The combined treatment by WRN-siRNA with CDDP had no
additional effect on mitotic catastrophe, but, nevertheless, this
therapy had the most prominent anticancer effect in this study.
It is possible that the excess cell death, including necrosis—in
addition to that caused by apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe—
was caused by the combination of WRN-siRNA with CDDP.
WRN-null cells from Werner syndrome patients show hypersensitivity to several types of DNA-damaging agents such as
cross-linking agents (CDDP, mitomycin C; ref. 35), a DNA
topoisomerase I-trapping agent (camptothecin) (20, 36) and
hydroxyurea (37). Silencing of WRN in cancer cells increases the
chemotherapeutic activity of camptothecin (17) and CDDP (7,
38). The epigenetic inactivation of WRN leads to repress WRN
proteins, and increases chromosomal instability and sensitivity
to chemotherapeutic drugs in cultured cells; and enhances the
clinical sensitivity to camptothecin in human colorectal
tumors (22). WRN interacting with DNA-PKcs and/or KU7080 may participate in DNA repair of double-strand breaks
through the nonhomologous end-joining pathway (39–42).
WRN also participates in telomere maintenance (11, 18). Loss
of normal WRN function causes telomere shortening, and
substantial shortening of telomeres mediates cellular senescence and/or apoptosis to inhibit tumorigenesis (42–44). Thus,
WRN-siRNA could exert its effect through inhibition of DNA
repair and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), which is
nontelomerase mechanism for telomere maintenance (18, 45).
Although further studies on these interacting pathways are
needed for clarifying the mechanism of the combined anticancer therapy with WRN-siRNA and CDDP, WRN-siRNA could
enhance the anticancer effect of CDDP leading to cell-growth
suppression and cell death.

We investigated mitotic catastrophe in tumor cells in vivo.
Mitotic catastrophe is defined as a type of cell death caused by
aberrant mitosis (25, 28, 46). The MPM-2 monoclonal antibody
binds to a phosphorylated amino acid–containing epitope
present on more than 40 proteins of G2–M phase eukaryotic
cells (47). MPM-2 stainings reflect cell populations in the G2–
M phase, and the aberrant increase is associated with mitotic
catastrophe (48). CDDP monotherapy increased the MPM-2–
positive rate, and the additional administration of RECQL1siRNA enhanced the rate much more. However, additional
administration of WRN-siRNA had no additional effect on the
MPM-2–positive rate. The cell death caused by combining
WRN-siRNA with CDDP could not be adequately explained
through mitotic catastrophe.
The DNA damage caused by siRNA or CDDP was assessed
by g-H2A.X stain reflecting an early DNA double-strand
breaks (49). Our data showed that the combined therapy
with CDDP and RECQL1-siRNA enhanced the DNA damage
maximally. When the cancer cells were treated with both
RECQL1-siRNA and CDDP, they could not repair the DNA
damage, and fell into G2–M phase arrest and apoptosis. Our
findings were similar to hypersensitivity of RECQL1-deficient cells against genotoxic agents such as camptothecin
and ionizing radiation (14, 50). On the contrary, the combined therapy with CDDP and WRN-siRNA reduced the
number of cancer cells maximally, but the DNA-damage
evaluation could not explain the effect adequately. WRNdeficient cells are known to be hypersensitive to CDDP and
fall into cell death (35), and our study could indicate the
similar phenomena.
Taken together, this study provides preclinical proof-ofconcept for 2 RecQ DNA helicases as novel therapeutic targets

to treat aggressive head and neck cancers. The combination of
RECQL1-siRNA with CDDP resulted in maximal apoptosis and
mitotic catastrophe. On the contrary, WRN-siRNA downregulated WRN expression leading to the failure of DNA repair and
induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. This is the first study
to show the difference in the mechanisms of anticancer effect
between RECQL1 and WRN silencing. Further elucidation of
the mechanism behind the apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe
caused by the combination of WRN-siRNA with CDDP should
be necessary. CDDP combined with WRN-siRNA might induce
cell death such as necrosis in addition to the caspase-dependent apoptosis.
