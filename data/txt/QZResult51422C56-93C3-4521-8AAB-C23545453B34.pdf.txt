ABSTRACT
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is critical
for cellular growth and metabolism. Recently, mosaic or segmental overgrowth, a
clinical condition caused by heterozygous somatic activating mutations in PIK3CA,
was established as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). In this study, we
report a Japanese female diagnosed with PROS, who presented with hyperplasia of the
lower extremities, macrodactyly, multiple lipomatosis, and sparse hair. Sequencing
and mutant allele frequency analysis of PIK3CA from affected tissues revealed that the
patient had a heterozygous mosaic mutation (c.3140A>G [p.H1047R]) in PIK3CA and
that there were higher mutant allele frequencies from samples with a larger amount
of subcutaneous adipose tissue. We established two fibroblast cell lines from the
patient, harboring high and low frequencies of the mosaic mutation, in which AKT and
S6 showed higher level of phosphorylation compared with three control fibroblasts,
indicating that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is activated. We assessed the therapeutic
effects of four compounds (rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235, aspirin, and metformin) on
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and cell growth. All four compounds suppressed
S6 phosphorylation and inhibited cell growth of the patient-derived fibroblast cell
lines. However, only metformin mildly inhibited the growth of the control fibroblast
cell lines. Since PROS is a congenital disorder, drugs for therapy should take into
consideration the natural growth of children. Thus, metformin is a candidate drug for
treating PROS in growing children.

subcutaneous, muscular, fibroadipose, and skeletal tissues
is the common feature of these disorders [12]. The term,
PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS), has
been proposed to represent the broad range of clinical
manifestations caused by PIK3CA mutations [13]. Similar
and related disorders are caused by somatic mutations in
the genes of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (mammalian target of
rapamycin) pathway, which include PTEN [14], PIK3R2
(MCAP) [7], AKT1 (Proteus syndrome) [15], AKT2
(asymmetric overgrowth and hypoglycemia) [16], and
AKT3 (hemimegalencephaly) [17].
In this study, we identified the most common
somatic mosaic mutation of PIK3CA (c.3140A>G,
[p.H1047R]) in a Japanese female patient with PROS.
We analyzed the correlation between the severity of
overgrowth and the mutant allele frequency from affected
tissues by quantitative PCR and direct sequencing. Further,
we established dermal fibroblast cell lines harboring high
and low frequencies of the mosaic mutation from the
patient’s affected tissues and assessed the therapeutic
effects of four compounds (rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235,
aspirin, and metformin) on PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
inhibition by determining the phosphorylation status of
associated proteins and measuring cell proliferation.

(−0.3 SD), and she measured 50.5 cm (0.4 SD) in height,
with an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) of 32 cm
(−0.7 SD). Deformity of the feet was noted at birth. The
left second, third, and fourth toes showed cutaneous
syndactyly, and the right second and third toes showed
syndactyly. An increased volume of subcutaneous adipose
tissue in the left chest, the perineum, and the inside of the
right thigh was obvious at one week after birth. The entire
left leg and the right foot were severely enlarged, and the
toes of both feet showed dactylomegaly (Figure 1C and
Figure 1D). Brain magnetic resonance imaging at one
month showed normal findings. The patient was diagnosed
with bilateral dactylomegaly at 9 months and subcutaneous
adipose tissue at the left knee and the distal phalanx of the
first, second, and third left toes were surgically removed.
At 2 years and 9 months, subcutaneous adipose tissue at
the left knee, lower abdomen, perineum, and left lower leg
was surgically removed. She showed normal milestones
of head control at 3 months, sitting up at 5 months, and
walking at 1 year. At 2 years, her weight, height, and
OFC were 12.5 kg (0 SD), 85 to 89.5 cm (−1.4 SD~0
SD, because of different sizes of the legs), and 46.5 cm
(−1.1 SD), respectively. It was noted that she had sparse
hair and that her skin was thin with a small volume of
adipose tissue on parts of the body other than the regions
of overgrowth. Intellectual development was normal as per
age equivalency and development quotient at 2 years and
4 months was 111. The presented patient was diagnosed
with PROS taking into account the following findings: 1)
presence of somatic PIK3CA mutation (described below),
2) congenital onset, 3) overgrowth being sporadic and
mosaic, 4) overgrowth in adipose and skeletal tissues,
5) isolated macrodactyly, overgrown splayed feet, and
overgrown limb, and 6) truncal adipose overgrowth [13].

the lower limb and perineum have 40.9% and 25.8%
mutant allele frequency ratios, respectively, as determined
by quantitative multiplex PCR (Figure 2B). Immunoblot
analysis revealed that the levels of phosphorylated AKT
and ribosomal protein S6 (S6) were increased in PROS
fibroblasts as compared to those in normal fibroblasts
(Figure 4A). To assess the therapeutic effects on segmental
overgrowth of PROS, we treated the two fibroblast
lines derived from the patient’s affected skin (PROS
fibroblasts) and three normal controls (control fibroblasts)
with rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor), NVP-BEZ235
(dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor), aspirin, and metformin
(Figure 3). We used metformin at the concentration used
previously for cultured cancer cells [22–26]. First, we
analyzed the changes in phosphorylation of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR signaling molecules S6 and AKT following
treatment with these agents. Western blotting showed
that rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235, and aspirin significantly
inhibited phosphorylation of S6 in both PROS and
control fibroblasts (Figure 4B and Figure 4C). Compare
with rapamycin, metformin mildly reduced the level of
phosphorylated S6 only in two of the PROS fibroblast
lines (Figure 4C). In addition, NVP-BEZ235 decreased
phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 in PROS fibroblasts
(Figure 4B). However, rapamycin induced phosphorylation
of AKT at Ser473 in both control and PROS cells (Figure
4B and Figure 4C). Next, cell growth of PROS and control
fibroblasts after treatment with each agent was assayed
(Figure 5). Rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235, and aspirin showed
remarkable growth inhibition of both PROS and control
fibroblasts. Metformin also effectively suppressed the
growth of both PROS fibroblast lines, which had different
frequency of mosaic mutations. However, the effect on the
growth of control cells was mild.
To examine the effect of these compounds on
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in detail, dose-response
studies were carried out on control (C2) and PROS
(lower limb) fibroblasts (Figure 6). Western blots from
fibroblasts treated with rapamycin show that there was
an inverse relationship between the phosphorylation of
S6 and AKT. NVP-BEZ235 diminished phosphorylated
S6 and AKT at Ser473 in PROS fibroblasts, but
inhibition of AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 required
higher concentrations of NVP-BEZ235 than that of S6
phosphorylation. Although NVP-BEZ235 also inhibited
PI3K activity, phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308, which
is phosphorylated by PDK1, was induced by treatment
of 100 nM NVP-BEZ235 in PROS fibroblasts. High
concentrations of aspirin and metformin (5 mM and
10 mM, respectively) were required for inhibition of
S6 phosphorylation on PROS cells. Since it is known
that metformin and, in some cases, aspirin can activate
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [27, 28], the
phosphorylation state of AMPK in the fibroblasts was
investigated. Metformin at concentrations of 1 mM and
higher induced phosphorylation of AMPK of PROS and

Identification and characterization of the
PIK3CA H1047R mutation
Since mutations in PIK3CA contribute to unilateral
and/or segmental overgrowth phenotypes, we determined
nucleotide sequences of PIK3CA from the patient’s
affected adipose tissues and skin by direct sequencing and
identified a heterozygous mosaic mutation (c.3140A>G
[p.H1047R]) in exon 20 (Figure 2A). The mutant allele
was detected in all the affected tissues with the peak height
ratio of A/(G+A) at nucleotide position 3140 determined
by direct sequencing. Direct sequencing of PCR products
and sequencing of 24 subcloned PCR products containing
c.3140 confirmed that the patient’s blood cells did not
contain the mutant allele. To determine the mutant allele
frequency at nucleotide position 3140 of PIK3CA, we
performed a quantitative multiplex PCR assay (Figure 2B).
The calculated mutant allele frequencies of PIK3CA in
the patient’s affected tissues and blood lymphocytes as
determined by quantitative multiplex PCR and direct
sequence are shown in Figure 2C. The frequencies of
the PIK3CA mutant allele in the adipose tissue from
the patient’s perineum, lower limb 1, lower limb 2, and
chest determined by quantitative multiplex PCR were
6.9%, 9.9%, 11.1%, and 13.7%, respectively, and those in
the skin of the perineum and lower limb were 3.4% and
8.7%, respectively. Of note, mutant allele frequency ratios
determined by direct nucleotide sequence analysis were
approximately double the frequency ratios determined by
quantitative PCR analysis. This is possibly because of the
large cycle number (36) in the PCR protocol for amplifying
the region of genomic DNA that included the mutation.
The mutant allele frequencies were higher in subcutaneous
adipose tissues than in skin tissue. Among the affected
regions, the mutation frequencies were higher in the lower
limbs and chest than in the perineum. Thus, there was a
higher mutant allele frequency in samples from regions
with a larger mass of subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Effect of direct or indirect inhibition of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR signaling in fibroblasts
Previous studies demonstrated that mutations in
PIK3CA cause gain-of-function of PI3K, which leads
to activation of downstream pathways and enhances
cellular growth in cancer and a spectrum of overgrowth
disorders [5, 19–21]. We hypothesized that inhibitors
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway could be
used for effective therapeutic treatment for PROS. To
evaluate the therapeutic effect of such compounds, we
established dermal fibroblast cell lines from skins of the
lower limb and perineum of the presented patient, as an
experimental model. It is noted that, the cell lines from

was performed using isolated genomic DNA from blood and six different regions including subcutaneous adipose tissue and skin from the
lower limbs. A mosaic mutation (c.3140A>G [p.H1047R]) in exon 20 was identified from affected adipose tissues and skin. The ratios of

mutation. We demonstrate the correlation between mutant
allele frequency and the size of adipose tissues in the
presented patient. Moreover, we also show that direct
sequencing is a useful diagnostic genetic test to identify
a mosaic mutation in affected adipose tissue or fibroblast
cells, even though these are small overgrown regions.
A major manifestation of PROS is progressive
segmental overgrowth in various regions of the body
present congenitally or starting in early childhood [13].
Since surgical debulking and orthopedic procedures are
currently the only available treatments for patients with
segmental overgrowth syndromes [30, 31], it is imperative
to develop new therapeutic approaches and effective
treatments to combat these syndromes. Recently, the

DISCUSSION
We report the characterization of a PROS patient
harboring a mosaic PIK3CA (c.3140A>G [p.H1047R])
mutation in the affected tissues. H1047R is the most
common amino acid substitution, occurring in a helix
domain at the end of the activation loop of the p110α/p85α
complex. A recent study demonstrated that the H1047R
mutation in PIK3CA causes extensive remodeling of
gene signatures, thus this single base mutation has an
unexpectedly deep and broad impact on the phenotypic
properties of the cell [29]. Therefore, it is important to
investigate whether the patient’s tissues contain this

0941 (a potent inhibitor of PI3K p110α) effectively
inhibited the proliferation of both LM-mutant and control
lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Rapamycin had a
stronger effect on proliferation of LM-LECs than that
of control LEC, but the effect of rapamycin and GDC0941 on the phosphorylation of AKT in LM-LECs was
not described. 3) Wortmannin and LY294002 (PI3K
inhibitors) abrogated the over-activation of AKT and
p70S6K in fibroblasts derived from two PROS patients in
the absence of serum. Thus, wortmannin and LY294002
decrease growth factor-independent proliferation and AKT
phosphorylation. However, the effect of these inhibitors on
the growth of normal cells was not described.
Constitutive activation of PI3K is a characteristic
feature in PROS patients with PIK3CA mutations and

overgrowth of cells in patients’ organs usually occurs with
the onset of expression of certain growth factors during
development. Previous studies have shown PI3K activation
of lymphoblastoid cells harboring PIK3CA mutations
cultured in media with 15% FCS [7, 35]. Therefore, we
established PROS patient-derived fibroblasts harboring
a high frequency (40.9%) and a low frequency (25.8%)
of the mutation to study the therapeutic effects of small
compounds on control and PROS fibroblasts in medium
containing 10% FCS. First, we analyzed the effects of the
direct inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway,
rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235, on PROS fibroblasts.
Rapamycin acts as a specific inhibitor of mTORC1
(Figure 3) and has synergistic anti-cancer effects [36].
NVP-BEZ235 is a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor [37]

(Figure 3) and is currently in phase I/II clinical trials
for treating advanced solid tumors [38]. In this study,
we show that 1 nM rapamycin completely suppressed
the phosphorylation of S6 and the cell growth of both
control and PROS fibroblasts (Figures 4, 5, and 6). Thus,
the PROS fibroblasts are sensitive to a low concentration
of rapamycin, which is a similar dose as is used to treat
rapamycin-sensitive cancer cells [39]. In this model,
rapamycin increased phosphorylated AKT, likely as a
result of rapamycin-induced feedback activation of AKT
signaling [40] (Figures 3, 4C, and 6A). Thus, PI3K/AKT
signaling upstream of mTOR is more highly activated
in PROS fibroblasts than in control cells, leading to the
activation of the collateral pathways upstream of mTOR.
Similarly, 5 nM NVP-BEZ235 inhibited mTOR activity of
control and PROS fibroblasts by completely suppressing
phosphorylation of S6 while slightly increasing the
phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308 in PROS fibroblasts
(Figures 3, 4B, and 6B). This phenomenon could be
explained by induction of feedback activation of AKT
signaling by mTOR inhibition. Importantly, the findings
of this study are similar to those of a previously reported
study on cancer cells with a PI3K active mutation [41].
Thus, rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235 are therapeutically
effective to treat PROS, but these inhibitors suppress cell
growth of both PROS cells and control cells. Moreover,
side effects such as mucositis, elevation of ALT/AST,
hypercholesterolemia, headache, and neutropenia
were reported in the treatment of complicated vascular
anomalies in children with rapamycin [42]. These findings
indicate that administration of both compounds should
be carefully performed to avoid serious side effects in
growing children.
Next, we analyzed the effect of indirect inhibitors
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway aspirin and
metformin on control and PROS fibroblasts. Aspirin is an
anti-inflammatory drug and has been shown to increase
the five-year survival rate of patients with several types
of cancer [43], including colorectal cancer harboring
PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20 [44, 45]. Aspirin
inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX), leading to reduction of
prostaglandin production [46]. Recent studies have shown
that aspirin inhibits mTOR signaling by activating AMPK
in cancer cells [28, 47] (Figure 3). We demonstrated that 5
mM aspirin completely blocked the phosphorylation of S6
and inhibited cell growth of control and PROS fibroblasts,
but we did not observe phosphorylation of AMPK in
PROS cells (Figures 4B, 5A, and 6C). Importantly, the
aspirin concentration (5 mM) used in this study is similar
to the effective aspirin concentration (1 to 3 mM) in the
blood of patients taking high-dose aspirin (100 mg/kg/
day) for type 2 diabetes and Kawasaki disease [48, 49].
However, the use of high-dose aspirin may increase the
risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage [50], sensorineural
hearing loss [51], and Reye syndrome [52] in children.
Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride), a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

biguanide derivate, is the drug most commonly used in
treating type 2 diabetes [53]. Previous epidemiological
studies have demonstrated that metformin can reduce
the risk of cancer in diabetic patients [54, 55]. Recently,
metformin has been shown to decrease the risk of several
cancers, including colon, breast, prostate, and pancreatic
cancers [56]. One of the molecular mechanisms underlying
the anti-cancer effects of metformin is the activation
of AMPK (Figure  3), which results in suppression of
mTOR signaling [56]. In this study, we found that 10 mM
metformin treatment activates AMPK and reduces S6
phosphorylation without affecting AKT phosphorylation
in both control and PROS fibroblast cells (Figure 6D).
Importantly, metformin strongly inhibited cell growth
of the PROS fibroblasts containing either high or low
frequency of the mosaic H1047R mutation, while the
effect on the three control cell lines was mild (Figure 5).
Compared with the other three compounds, metformin
had a milder effect of suppressing phosphorylation of
S6 in PROS cells (Figure 4 and Figure  6). Therefore,
the suppression of the phosphorylation of S6 is difficult
to explain in light of the selective cell growth inhibition
of PROS cells by metformin, and so, other molecular
mechanisms may be involved in the selective growth
inhibition. A high concentration of metformin (~10 mM)
was necessary to suppress the growth of PROS fibroblasts
in this study likely because of the fact that metformin does
not passively diffuse through cell membranes because of
its low lipophilicity and so it must be transported into cells
by the transmembrane protein organic cation transporters
1-3 [57–59]. Similarly, a concentration of at least 1 mM
metformin was required to suppress the growth of two
types of endometrial cancer-derived cell lines, one of which
has a mutation in PTEN in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
pathway [60] (Figure 3). On the other hand, a recent
clinical study on patients with endometrial cancer has also
shown that oral administration of 1500–2250 mg/day of
metformin for 4 weeks resulted in a significantly reduced
expression of the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 and
decreased phosphorylated S6 in endometrial cancer tissues
[60]. The metformin concentrations in the plasma and
endometrial cancer tissues of these patients were 6.8 to 18.1
μM and 1.2 to 5.1 μmol/kg wet weight, respectively [60].
Although we do not have sufficient evidence to explain
the difference in effective metformin concentrations, low
concentrations having been reported in patients’ blood
and tissue compared with high concentrations required
for efficacy in cell culture medium for PROS fibroblasts
in this study, it is possible that metformin acts on PROS
fibroblasts with different frequencies of mosaic mutations
in the same manner as it does in cancer cells [60]. In a
randomized clinical trial of metformin to treat obese
insulin-resistant children with dosages ranging from 500 to
2000 mg/day, side effects such as nausea, loose stool, and
fatigue were reported, but serious or life-threatening events
were not noted [61]. Therefore, administration of regular

daily doses of metformin is one of the candidate treatments
for PROS patients.
In summary, we studied the effect of four small
compounds, rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235, aspirin, and
metformin on control and PROS fibroblasts and
demonstrated that all four compounds could suppress the
activated PIK3/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and the
growth of PROS patient-derived fibroblasts by suppressing
phosphorylation of S6. However, only metformin showed
mild inhibition of the growth of control fibroblasts. Since
PROS is a developmental disorder in children, metformin
is a candidate drug for treating PROS. However, further
investigation is necessary to elucidate the molecular
mechanism governing the higher sensitivity of cell growth
of PROS fibroblasts to metformin than that of control cells
and to determine the optimal concentration of metformin
required to effectively suppress the growth of mutant cells
in PROS patients.

To determine frequencies of the missense mutation
of PIK3CA gene (c.3140A>G) in patient tissues, we
established a quantification method for determining the
dosage of genomic DNA using multiplex PCR (Figure 2B).
Specific primer pairs (mismatch sense S2: 5′-atgaaacaa
atgaatgatgcaag-3′ and antisense A2: 5′-acaaacaatcttcaaagt
ttacct-3′; --cacg was changed to --caag) were designed to
specifically amplify a 370 bp DNA fragment containing
only the mutant PIK3CA gene (c.3140A>G). Another pair
of primers (S1 and A2) were also designed to amplify a 480
bp genomic DNA fragment containing wild-type and mutant
PIK3CA. Aliquots (0.05 μg) of genomic DNA from each
affected tissue and a normal blood sample were amplified
by PCR in a total volume of 20 μL, containing 0.45 μM of
total primers, 30 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, and 1 U of AmpliTaq-Gold
(Applied Biosystems). The ratio of the concentrations of
the three primers was 1 : 4 : 5 (S1 : S2 : A2). PCR samples
were preheated at 94°C for 10 min and 32 PCR cycles were
performed. Each cycle consisted of 30 s denaturation at
94°C, 30 s annealing at 56°C, and 30 s extension at 72°C.
The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose
gels and band intensities were measured using Image Quant
TL 7.0 software (GE healthcare).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Treatment of PROS fibroblast cells with
inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
pathway

Identification of somatic mutation

Two PROS fibroblast cell lines were established from
the patient’s lower limb and perineum. Two control fibroblast
cell lines (C2 and C3), which were previously established
from the skins of two unrelated healthy volunteers of a
36-year-old male and a 27-year-old female, respectively, [62]
were used. Additionally, a normal human dermal fibroblast
cell line established from the skin of a 14-year-old male
(NHDF-c, c-12300) was purchased from PromoCell GmbH
(Heidelberg, Germany). Fibroblast cells were cultured
as previously described [62]. Briefly, fibroblasts were
maintained in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (EMEM;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with
10% FCS, penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL),
L-glutamine (1.75 mM), HEPES (10 mM), and NaHCO3
(0.13%). All supplemental reagents, except for FCS, were
purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). The cells
were plated on 35-mm collagen-coated dishes at a density of
1.1 × 104 cells/cm2 for biochemical experiments. Fibroblast
cells were treated with rapamycin (LKT Laboratories, St.
Paul, MN, USA), NVP-BEZ235 (Chemscene, Monmouth
Junction, NJ, USA), aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid; Wako,
Osaka, Japan) and metformin hydrochloride (SigmaAldrich) for 2 days, washed with PBS, and then harvested
and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting.

Genomic DNA was isolated from seven different
regions, including subcutaneous adipose tissue from the
chest, lower limb, and perineum, skin from the lower limb
and perineum, and white blood cells by phenol/chloroform
extraction. To identify the mutations in PIK3CA, DNA
fragments including all exons and exon-intron junctions
of PIK3CA were amplified from genomic DNA by 36
cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific
primer sets. The resulting PCR products were separated
by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified with QIAEX
II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and
then directly sequenced using the GenomeLab GeXP
Genetic Analysis System (AB SCIEX, Framingham,
MA, USA) and the GenomeLab Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing with Quick Start Kit (Beckman Coulter,
Brea, CA, USA) with 50 to 100 fmol of template DNA.
For quantification, 380 bp of wild-type and mutant
PCR products of the PIK3CA gene including exon 20
were amplified from genomic DNA isolated from lower
limb adipose tissue by PCR using a specific primer set
(sense S1: 5′-caatgatgcttggctctgga-3′; antisense A1:
5′-tcaaaccctgtttgcgtttac-3′) and subcloned into pGEM-T
Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

for design of the work, interpretation of data, and revision
for intellectual content.

Samples were electrophoresed on 11% SDS
polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt,
Germany). The membranes were incubated in 5% bovine
serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.03%
Tween-20) and then incubated with primary antibodies
anti-pan-AKT, anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473), anti-phosphoAKT (Thr308), anti-pan-S6, anti-phospho-S6 (Ser235/236)
(Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA), and
anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by incubation
with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with
Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer, MA, USA).
Densitometric measurement of bands on western blotting
was performed using ImageJ software (US National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

MTT assay
Cell
growth
was
assessed
using
the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. Briefly, fibroblast cells were seeded at a density
of 3.1 × 104 cells/cm2 onto collagen-coated 96-well culture
plates. Each day, 10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS)
was added to each well. After incubation for 2 h at 37°C, the
purple-blue MTT formazan precipitate was dissolved in 200
μL of MTT solvent (40 mM HCl in isopropanol) and the
absorbance was measured with a multiplate reader at 570 nm.
