ABSTRACT
Myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8) and 14 (MRP14) are abundantly expressed in
several kinds of benign and malignant tumors. However, little is known about their
clinicopathological significance in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), biliary
intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN), intraductal papillary neoplasm of bile duct (IPNB), or
inflammatory hepatic biliary ducts epithelium (IHBD). This study aimed to investigate
the diagnostic and prognostic values of MRP8 and MRP14 as new biomarkers for ICC.
We examined MRP8 and MRP14 expression levels by immunohistochemistry in IHBD
(n = 15), BilIN (BilIN1 = 24, BilIN2 = 9, BilIN3 = 5), IPNB (n = 18) and ICC (n =
416). The differential diagnostic and prognosis values were also evaluated. The results
showed that the ratio of tumor-infiltrating MRP8 and MRP14 positive immune cells,
relative to biliary epithelial cells, was significantly increased in ICC tissues compared
with nonmalignant tissues, including IHBD, BilIN1, BilIN2, BilIN3, and IPNB (P value
< 0.05). In addition, over-expression levels of MRP8 and MRP14 were correlated with
overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) by univariate analysis; MRP8/
MRP14 combination was an independent prognostic factor for OS and TTR. MRP8 and
MRP14 expression might help to identify the benign bile duct diseases from ICC, as
high expression of MRP8 and MRP14 suggests a poor prognosis after surgical resection.

Early diagnosis of ICC is possible to carry out
radical surgery. Biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN)
and intraductal papillary neoplasm of bile duct (IPNB) are
two proposed benign bile duct diseases for the development
and progression of ICC. It was reported that the protein
expression pattern of mucin core proteins (MUCs)/
cytokeratins (CKs) and P16/EZH2/Mmi1 in neoplastic
biliary epithelia differed according to the pathway of
cholangiocarcinogenesis, via BilIN or IPNB lineage [5, 6].

INTRODUCTION
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a poorly
understood biliary malignancy that accounts for an estimated
10–15% of all primary liver cancers [1] and approximately
8% of cholangiocarcinomas [2]. However, in the United
States, the age-adjusted incidence of ICC increased from
0.32 per 100,000 individuals in 1975 to 0.85 per 100,000
individuals in 2000, and is still increasing [3, 4].

Partial hepatectomy remains the gold standard of
curative treatment for ICC [7, 8]. However, prognosis
after partial hepatectomy is unsatisfactory, with a high
incidence of locoregional recurrence and/or distant
metastases [9–11]. Identifying effective novel prognostic
biomarkers that might be related to the development and
progression of ICC may help provide new therapeutic
strategies.
Myeloid-related protein (MRP) has been implicated
in multiple stages of tumorigenesis, progression and
prognosis. MRP carries out a wide range of intracellular
and extracellular functions, such as regulation of
calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell
invasion and motility, cytoskeleton interactions, protein
phosphorylation, regulation of transcriptional factors,
autoimmunity, chemotaxis, inflammation and pluripotency
[12].
In this study, we analyzed the involvement of MRP8
and MRP14 in the progression of cholangiocarcinogenesis
through BilIN and IPNB, and investigated its role in tumor
progression of ICC.

and IPNB were 0.8846 and 0.8000, 0.8341 and 0.7083,
0.6370 and 0.7780, 0.5962 and 1.0000, and 0.7716 and
0.8333, respectively. In addition, discriminating efficacy
was represented by area under the curve (AUC) of ROC
curves. For MRP8, the AUC was 0.8191 for ICC/IHBD,
0.7860 for ICC/BilIN1, 0.7882 for ICC/BilIN2, 0.7606 for
ICC/BilIN3, and 0.8806 for ICC/IPNB. For MRP14, the
AUC was 0.8978 for ICC/IHBD, 0.8254 for ICC/BilIN1,
0.7567 for BilIN2, 0.7894 for ICC/BilIN3, and 0.8791 for
ICC/IPNB (Figure 2).

Prognostic significance
In the prognostic group, among 416 patients at the
last follow-up, 309 had died and 319 had tumor recurrence.
To enhance the prognostic value, the expression level
represented by MRP8 and MRP14 positive cells to the
biliary epithelial cell number was combined. KaplanMeier analysis in both the primary cohort and the testing
cohort showed that the overall survival (OS) and time
to recurrence (TTR) rates were statistically better in the
combined low-MRP group than those in at least one highMRP group, with the exception of OS in the testing group
(P = 0.041 for OS and P = 0.020 for TTR in primary
cohort; P = 0.067 for OS and P = 0.047 for TTR in testing
cohort, Supplementary Figure S3).
In addition, results from the Kaplan-Meier analyses
that combined primary and testing cohorts showed that
the OS and TTR rates were significantly better in the
combined low-MRP group than those in at least one
high-MRP group (P = 0.001 for OS, P = 0.002 for TTR,
Figure 3).
Univariate analysis showed that serum-alpha
fetal protein (AFP), -carcino embryonic antigen
(CEA), -carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), -albumin
(ALB), -gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), -alanine
transaminase (ALT), -alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tumor
size, tumor number, micro-vascular invasion, tumor-nodesmetastases (TNM), MRP8 number, MRP8 ratio, MRP14
number, MRP8 ratio, and combined MRP8/MRP14
ratio were predictors for OS in a combined primary and
testing cohort. Furthermore, liver cirrhosis, serum-CEA,
-CA199, -GGT, -ALP, tumor size, tumor number, microvascular invasion, TNM, MRP8 number, MRP8 ratio,
MRP14 number, MRP14 ratio, and MRP8/MRP14 ratio
combination were predictors for TTR in combined primary
and testing cohorts. Multivariate Cox regression analysis
indicated that serum-AFP, -CEA, -ALB, -ALP, tumor size,
tumor number, TNM, and MRP8 ratio were independent
prognostic factors for OS in ICC patients after the surgical
resection. In addition, liver cirrhosis, serum-CEA, -ALP,
tumor size, tumor number, TNM, and MRP8/MRP14 ratio
combination were independent prognostic factors for TTR
in ICC patients after the surgical resection in combined
primary and testing cohort (Table 1). Similarly, univariate
analysis in the primary cohort showed that serum-CEA,

MRP8 and MRP14 were mostly detected in tumorinfiltrating immune cells (neutrophils and monocytes;
Supplementary Figure S1) or biliary epithelial cell
infiltrating immune cells (Figure 1), as reported previously
[13]. The expression level represented by the ratio of
infiltrating MRP8 and MRP14 positive cells compared
with the number of biliary epithelial cells was calculated.
The results showed that the ratio of MRP8 positive cells
to biliary epithelial cells in ICC was higher than in IHBD
(P < 0.0001), BilIN1 (P < 0.0001), BilIN2 (P = 0.0031),
BilIN3 (P = 0.0453), and IPNB (P < 0.0001). The ratio of
MRP14 positive cells to biliary epithelial cells in ICC was
higher than in IHBD (P < 0.001), BilIN1 (P < 0.0001),
BilIN2 (P = 0.0084), BilIN3 (P = 0.0261), and IPNB (P <
0.0001) (Figure 2). In addition, the correlation coefficients
between MRP8 and MRP14 were r = 0.838 (P < 0.001)
and r = 0.823 (P < 0.001), respectively (Supplementary
Figure S2).

of carcinogenesis, biologic behaviors, clinical features,
imaging manifestations and therapeutic strategies. Despite
great clinical achievements in the treatment of ICC during
the past few decades, the prognosis of patients with ICC is
still unsatisfactory, with a high incidence of locoregional
recurrence and/or distant metastases [9–11]. Unfortunately,
there are limited prognostic markers for ICC, and the disease
requires a distinct prognostic predictive model.
Improving the survival rate of patients with
a malignant tumor after surgical resection requires
clinicians to engage in the active treatment of recurrence
and investigate the biological and clinicopathological
characteristics that reflect tumor behavior, such as
progressive or metastatic capability [16, 17].
MRP8 and MRP14 belong to the S100 gene family,
which is the largest subfamily of EF-hand calcium-binding
proteins. At least 25 distinct members of this subgroup have

been described [18]. S100 proteins form either homodimeric
or heterodimeric complexes with one another [19, 20]
and have a wide range of intracellular and extracellular
functions. Intracellular functions include: regulation of
calcium homeostasis, cell cycle, cell growth and migration,
phosphorylation, cytoskeletal components and transcriptional
factors. In contrast to their intracellular function, extracellular
S100 proteins act in a cytokine-like manner by binding to
cell surface receptors, such as the receptor for advanced
glycation end products (RAGE) and toll-like receptors
(TLRs) [18, 21].
There is increasing interest in the S100 proteins and
their relationship with inflammatory bile duct diseases
[22], BilIN and ICC [23], as well as both malignant and

benign gallbladder diseases [24], because of their altered
expression in various malignancies. In a recent study, the
prognostic significance of S100A4 in ICC was evaluated
[25]. However, the report did not address the diagnostic
or prognostic role of MRP8 or MRP14 in IHBD, BilIN,
IPNB, and ICC. Despite the statistical power analysis
(Supplementary Table S4) showed that it may be need
to more large scale validation, however, it is still a first
observation of diagnostic role of MRP8 and MRP14 in
ICC and benign biliary tissues.
In this study, the diagnostic and prognostic values
of MRP8 and MRP14 in BilIN, IPNB, and ICC were
investigated. We show, for the first time, that MRP8 and
MRP14 are significantly increased in infiltrating immune

cells of ICC tissues, compared with other nonmalignant
tissues, such as IHBD, BilIN1, BilIN2, BilIN3, and IPNB.
Moreover, high expression levels of MRP8 and MRP14
were indicative of a poor prognosis for ICC patients after
surgical resection.
In addition, we introduced a novel scoring method
for evaluating the MRP protein expression level, which
is represented by MRP positive cells/biliary epithelial
cell number. Furthermore, X-Tile plots were created for
assessment of a best cutoff point for continuous variables
and optimized cutoff points based on outcome. Our
results found novel cutoff points, such as serum-AFP of
7.5 ng/ml, -CEA of 5.2 ng/ml, -CA199 of 40 U/L, -ALB
of 37.3 mg/ml, -GGT of 54 U/L, -ALT of 50 U/L, -ALP
of 113 U/L, tumor size of 4 cm, MRP8 number of 8,
MRP8 ratio of 0.0498, MRP14 number of 5, and MRP8
ratio of 0.0025. Thus the novel assay method and cutoff
points proposed in this study may significantly enhance
the inter-laboratory assay and intra-laboratory assay
reproducibility.
Accumulating evidence shows that stromal cells in
neoplastic tissues play central roles in tumor progression
and cancer metastasis [26]. These stromal cells include
fibroblasts, vascular cells, and infiltrating leukocytes, as
well as bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, including
macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, myeloid cellderived suppressor cells and mesenchymal stem cells
[27]. In addition, MRP8 and MRP14 proteins are highly
expressed in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in many
epithelial tumors. Therefore, MRP8 and MRP14 proteins
are important constituents of the micro-environment that
critically contributes to the development of tumors [28,
29]. Our study has shown, for the first time, that MRP8
and MRP14 protein expressions are significantly increased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in ICC tissues and correlate with the prognosis of ICC
patient after surgical resection.
In conclusion, the expressions of MRP8 and MRP14
were significantly increased in infiltrating immune cells of
ICC tissues compared with IHBD, BilIN1, BilIN2, BilIN3,
and IPNB. The numbers of MRP8 and MRP14 positive
cells, compared with the total number of biliary epithelial
cells, are useful markers for predicting the progression and
prognosis of ICC. MRP8 might have a synergistic effect
with MRP14 in predicting the prognosis of ICC patients
after surgical resection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Four hundred and sixteen ICC specimens were
surgically resected and diagnosed at the Eastern
Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital from July 2000 to
December 2008, among which 207 cases comprised the
primary cohort and 209 cases comprised the testing cohort.
Biliary lesions were surgically resected and diagnosed at
the same hospital from March 2008 to September 2013.
The biliary lesions were divided into intrahepatic biliary
epithelium (IHBD) with inflammation (n = 18), BilIN1 (n =
25), BilIN2 (n = 12), BilIN3 (n = 5), and IPNB (n = 19)
(Supplementary Table S5). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)stained slides made from each formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissue that had undergone surgical resection
were reviewed by two experienced hepatopathologists
(WM Cong and H Dong). IHBD was defined as the mildly
hyperplastic epithelium with intraepithelial neutrophils and
lymphocytic infiltration, lacking a definite disturbance of
cell polarity [23]. The histopathologic definition of BilIN

with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Paraffin sections
were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through
decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%, 95%, and
85%, 5 min each). Antigens were retrieved by microwave
irradiation for 3 min in pH 6.0 citric buffer and cooled
at room temperature for 60 min. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked by incubation of the slides in 3%
H2O2/phosphate-buffered saline, and nonspecific binding
sites were blocked with goat serum. Primary antibodies
were diluted as follows: rabbit monoclonal antibody
against MRP8 (ab 92331; Abcam; Clone ID: EPR3554,
1/5000 dilution); rabbit polyclonal antibody against
calgranulin B (S100A9/MRP14) (sc-20173; Santa Cruz;
1/2500 dilution). The expression levels of MRP8 and MRP
14 were represented by the ratio of number of positive
cells to the biliary epithelial cell number.
The imaging system comprised a Leica CCD camera,
DFC420, connected to a Leica DM IRE2 microscope (Leica
Microsystems Imaging Solutions, Cambridge, UK). All
samples had one field captured from each core under highpower magnification (200 ×) using Leica QW in Plus V3
software. Therefore, a total of two photographs from each
sample were used to count the cell number using ImagePro Plus v6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD.
USA). Next, the ratio (relative positive numbers) of MRP8
and MRP 14 positive cells (absolute positive numbers) to
the total number of biliary epithelial cells was calculated
[33]. Finally, the mean ratios were calculated from two
photographs and used as the ratio of specimen.

Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 13.0
software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism
5.01. The significance of expression level for markers
between ICC, IHBD and neoplasia was analyzed by
the Mann-Whitney test. To evaluate the discriminating
efficacy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis
was performed. For calculating the best cut-off points
for OS and TTR, the X-Tile statistical package (version
3.5.0, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA) was
used. X-tile plot illustrates the presence of substantial
tumor subpopulations and shows the robustness of
the relationship between a biomarker and outcome by
construction of a two dimensional projection of every
