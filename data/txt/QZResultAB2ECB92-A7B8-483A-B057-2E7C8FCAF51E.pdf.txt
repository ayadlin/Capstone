Abstract
Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a cytokine with structural and
sequence homology to IL-2 and IL-15 that has antitumor
activity alone in mouse experimental tumor models and a
tolerable safety profile in phase I trials in patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeted at tumor-associated antigens
also have improved antitumor activities in mice when used in
combination with IL-21. Recently, we described a rational
three antibody-based approach (triple mAb, TrimAb) to eradicating established mouse tumors that required the generation
of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells and IFN-;. Herein, we show
that sequentially combining TrimAb with recombinant IL-21
can significantly improve the antitumor activity of this combination against very advanced disease. These data further
support the use of IL-21 in adjuvant settings where strong T
cell–mediated immune responses to tumors can be generated.

Introduction
Interleukin-21 (IL-21) binds the IL-21R heterodimer consisting
of the IL-21–specific IL-21Ra chain and the common g chain
(gc, CD132), and thus, IL-21 is a member of a family of cytokines
defined by the use of gc, which also includes IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9,
and IL-15. IL-21 is produced by activated CD4+ T cells and natural
killer (NK) T cells (1, 2), and an initial report described its ability to
affect the proliferation and function of NK cells, B cells, and T cells
(1). Considering its potential for immune activation, it is not
surprising that IL-21 also has antitumor effects. These have been
observed in mouse models including melanoma, sarcoma, bladder,
and renal cell carcinoma (3–7). The antitumor activity of IL-21 was
shown to depend on NK cells or CD8+ T cells or both depending on
the tumor model. Tumor rejection typically requires perforin (4, 5),
and in some models, rejection occurs via an NKG2D-dependent
mechanism (8). Other models have shown that antitumor
responses are associated with tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and
the induction of long lasting central and effector memory cells
(6, 7, 9, 10) or by the activation of NK cells. IL-21 can also enhance
endogenous tumor-specific antibody responses (11) and facilitate
NK cell differentiation (4) that enhances antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC; ref. 12). The ability of IL-21 to enhance
ADCC preclinically provides the justification for current studies in

combination with rituximab in CD20+ B cell non–Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00347971) or cetuximab
in patients with colorectal cancer (Eudract no. 2006-004231-30).
Within 4 years of its initial description, human clinical trials of
recombinant IL-21 have commenced and anticancer efficacy was
shown (13).
Further clinical development is currently under way with IL-21
either as a single agent or in combination with other treatment
modalities in multiple cancers. A phase I/II trial combining IL-21
with sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma is now recruiting
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00389285). More novel combinations in mice, such as concurrent treatment with IL-21 and
agonistic antibodies against tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors (14), have shown that
combinations could be justified on the basis that therapy-induced
cell death might enhance access of tumor antigens to antigenpresenting cells (APC), with subsequent improvement of T-cell
responses due to concurrent IL-21 administration. In considering
this possibility further, we have now undertaken to combine IL-21
with a triple monoclonal antibody (TrimAb) combination that
eradicates established tumors in its own right. The TrimAb
combination contains three agonistic monoclonal antibodies
(anti-DR5/anti-CD40/anti-CD137) that have previously been shown
to potently and rapidly eradicate a variety of preestablished tumors
(15), compared with dual and single combinations of these
antibodies that have minimal or no effects against even smaller
tumors. Anti-DR5 mediates apoptosis of TRAIL-sensitive tumor
cells and generates a tumor-specific adaptive immune response in
its own right (16), whereas in this context, it is believed anti-CD40
and anti-CD137 serve to activate dendritic cells and costimulate T
cells, respectively, to further stimulate tumor-specific immunity.
TrimAb-mediated antitumor effects were found to critically require
CD8+ T cells, IL-12, and IFN-g in the tumor rejection process (15),
and given this mechanism of action, we rationalized that the
addition of IL-21 might provide some further benefit to TrimAbinduced antitumor response. In a series of experimental mouse
tumor models, we now show that IL-21 can significantly further
improve the antitumor activity of an effective combined mAbbased therapy.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Inbred BALB/c wild-type (WT) mice were purchased from the
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. BALB/c perforindeficient (pfp / ), IFN-g–deficient, and double perforin and IFN-g–
deficient (pfp.IFN-g / ) mice were bred and maintained at the Peter
MacCallum Cancer Center, as previously described (17, 18). Mice of
8 to 12 wk of age were used in all experiments. Experiments were done
according to Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee Guidelines.
Antibodies and IL-21. We prepared and purified agonistic mAb to
mouse DR5 (MD5-1), agonistic mAb to mouse CD40 (FGK45; kindly
provided by Dr. Antonius Rolink), agonistic mAb to mouse CD137 (3H3
kindly provided by Dr. Robert Mittler), mAb to mouse CD4 (GK1.5), mAb to

mouse CD8 (53-6.7), and neutralizing mAb to mouse IL-12 (C17.8), as
previously described (15, 16, 19). For tumor therapy, we gave i.p. 100 Ag
mAbs, control hamster IgG, and/or control rat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) two to
four times as indicated. We purchased antibody to asialo-GM1 (ASGM1)
from Wako Pure Chemical Industrials Ltd. Recombinant mouse IL-21
protein was provided by Zymogenetics, Inc. Working preparations were
diluted in PBS, and mice were injected either i.p. with 20 Ag in 100 AL
volume on the days indicated in each experiment. Control mice received an
equal volume of PBS.
Tumor cell lines. We maintained and used BALB/c-derived TRAILsensitive 4T1 mammary carcinoma, TRAIL-sensitive R331 renal carcinoma,
and TRAIL-sensitive CT26 colon carcinoma, as previously described
(15, 16, 20).
Therapy of transplanted tumors. We s.c. inoculated tumor cells in the
hind flank of mice. We commenced single, dual, or triple mAb treatments
when tumors developed to a size of f3  3 (f9 mm2, 7 d after tumor
inoculation), or larger. We measured tumor size with a caliper as the
product of two perpendicular diameters (mm2) every second day. We did
surgical resection and spontaneous 4T1 metastases experiments as previously reported (15) with mAb treatments commencing on the resection of
primary tumor (on day 28).
In vivo cell depletion and IL-12 neutralization. We depleted CD8+ T
cells, CD4+ T cells, or NK cells and neutralized IL-12 by injection with the
appropriate antibodies after the method described (16, 20).
Statistical analysis. We used Mann-Whitney rank sum test for statistical
analysis of the tumor growth. We determined significant differences in
tumor rejection and survival from metastases at one time point by using a
log-rank and Wilcoxin Fisher’s exact test. P values <0.05 were considered as
significant.

injection of plasmid-encoding mouse IL-21 delivered by hydrodynamic injection as previously described (ref. 4; Supplementary
Fig. S1).
We next further tested the TrimAb/IL-21 combination against
other types of experimental tumors (Fig. 2) and more established
subcutaneous 4T1 tumors (Fig. 3) to determine if this combination
induced better eradication of established tumors over TrimAb
alone. Indeed the combination of TrimAb and IL-21 was found to
be more effective than TrimAb alone against established R331 renal
carcinoma (Fig. 2A) and CT26 colon adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2B).
Treatment of 4T1 with TrimAb or TrimAb/IL-21 was then delayed
until day 11 (mean tumor size, >17 mm2) or day 15 (mean tumor
size, >35 mm2; Fig. 3). Even when combined treatment was delayed
until day 15, all tumors responded to therapy and three of five were
completely eradicated by day 32 (Fig. 3). By contrast, TrimAb
treatment alone was less effective in each of the different treatment

Results
IL-21 enhances TrimAb-mediated rejection of established
primary tumors. We have previously shown the efficacy of a
combination of anti-DR5, anti-CD40, and anti-CD137 mAbs
(TrimAb) against established primary 4T1 mammary carcinomas
(15). In prior experiments, four treatments of TrimAb, spaced 3 or
4 days apart, were sufficient to eradicate the majority of small,
established primary 4T1 tumors (<10 mm2). Initially, to determine
whether IL-21 could potentiate the efficacy of the TrimAb combination, we only gave two sequential doses of TrimAb (on days 7
and 11 after tumor inoculation) and followed 3 days later by three
sequential daily treatments (days 14–16) of what had previously
been determined to be an optimal dose of recombinant mouse
IL-21. This type of schedule had previously been found to be
effective when combining anti-DR5 mAb and IL-21 (14). Consistent
with the ability of IL-21 to improve the antitumor activity of antiDR5, it also significantly enhanced the efficacy of TrimAb (P < 0.05;
Fig. 1A). Administration of two doses of TrimAb was able to induce
only rejection of one of five primary 4T1 tumors compared with
our previous treatment regimen, which could induce 60% to 80%
rejection of primary 4T1 tumors (15). In contrast, the TrimAb/IL-21
combination completely cured four of five mice, demonstrating the
ability of IL-21 to enhance the antitumor response induced by
TrimAb therapy. Notably, compared with control immunoglobulin
(cIg)–treated mice, IL-21 alone had little effect on 4T1 tumor
growth (Fig. 1A). These data were further supported by experiments where mice received four doses of TrimAb followed by IL-21
(Fig. 1B). Not surprisingly, TrimAb alone was more effective with
sustained tumor suppression beyond 30 days with three of five
mice becoming tumor free. However, the TrimAb/IL-21 combination afforded complete tumor eradication in all mice. A remarkably
similar pattern of 4T1 tumor growth suppression was observed in
TrimAb-treated mice receiving four treatments followed by a single

impressive result was obtained with only one of five mice treated
with TrimAb/IL-21 dying on day 86, and the remaining four mice
were completely tumor-free for at least 150 days (P = 0.0079;
Fig. 4A). Interestingly, in mice receiving IL-21 in combination with
single mAb treatments, IL-21 was not able to significantly extend
the survival of mice receiving anti-CD40 (40.0 F 0.3 days versus
42.6 F 1.0 days) but did enhance the survival of mice receiving antiDR5 (44.8 F 0.8 versus 65.2 F 2.3, P = 0.004) or anti-CD137 (48.6 F
0.7 versus 54.6 F 1.4, P = 0.0142; Fig. 4B). In addition, each dual
treatment containing anti-DR5 (anti-DR5/anti-CD40 and anti-DR5/
anti-CD137) was also significantly enhanced by IL-21, with two of
five mice receiving anti-DR5/anti-CD137 mAb and IL-21 remaining
tumor-free and the other three of five showing enhanced survival

IL-21 (Fig. 3).
IL-21 enhances TrimAb-mediated rejection of established
metastatic breast cancer. Given the encouraging results with
primary 4T1 tumors, we were encouraged to treat 4T1 in a more
clinically relevant orthotopic surgery protocol. Mice were injected
in the mammary gland with 5  104 4T1 tumor cells and on day 28
underwent surgery to remove the primary tumor, leaving the mice
heavily burdened with metastatic lesions in the lung, lymph nodes,
liver, and bone, as previously described (15). In this setting, mice
received TrimAb on days 28 and 31 and IL-21 on days 34 to 36 in an
attempt to rescue the mice from metastatic disease (Fig. 4A). The
disease burden was heavy because mice treated with cIg with IL-21
(42.7 F 0.9 days) or without IL-21 (37.3 F 0.8 days) succumbed to
metastases (mainly lung) within a few weeks of surgery, whereas
mice that received TrimAb alone survived for a significantly
prolonged period (77.0 F 3.4 days). A statistically improved and

over those mice receiving anti-DR5/anti-CD137 alone (Fig. 4C).
Further examination of the efficacy of TrimAb in combination with
IL-21 in the same 4T1 surgery/metastases model revealed that this
combination was more effective than anti-DR5/anti-CD137 and
IL-21, particularly when only one round of mAb treatments were

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

given (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, these data illustrated
that, although IL-21 could significantly enhance the efficacy with
single mAb combinations (DR5 and CD137), optimal efficacy was
seen in combination with TrimAb against primary and metastatic
disease, in particular strongly correlating with its effect on antiDR5 mAb.
Role of CD8+ T cells, IFN-;, and IL-12 in rejection of
established primary and metastatic breast cancer. We next
determined the role of cellular subsets and cytokines in the
mechanism of action of a combination of TrimAb/IL-21. TrimAb
and IL-21 reduced 4T1 tumor burden and enhanced the survival of
mice postsurgery, and this effect was completely abolished by the
depletion of CD8+ T cells (P = 0.004) but not at all by the depletion
of CD4+ T cells (P = 0.652) and NK cells (P = 0.999; Fig. 5).
Consistent with our previous report (15), CD8+ T-cell depletion also
completely abrogated the antitumor activity of TrimAb (P = 0.004;
Fig. 5). In a similar manner, CD8+ T cells, but not NK cells or CD4+
T cells, were critical for TrimAb/IL-21–mediated suppression of
subcutaneous 4T1 tumors when four doses of TrimAb were
followed with a single dose of plasmid IL-21 (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Using a similar treatment regimen, it was determined
that neutralization or deficiency of IL-12 or IFN-g, respectively,
resulted in no therapeutic benefit of TrimAb alone or TrimAb in
combination with IL-21 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Perforin deficiency alone resulted in a partial loss of efficacy of TrimAb or TrimAb
and IL-21 (Supplementary Fig. S4). These data suggested the
mechanism of action of TrimAb alone or in combination with IL-21
were very similar, if not identical, and that IL-21 enhanced the
immune response mediated with TrimAb.
IL-21 promotes enhanced tumor-specific memory. Given the
enhanced therapeutic efficacy of TrimAb in combination with IL21, we next determined whether IL-21 was also improving
secondary memory responses to tumor rechallenge. Cohorts of
mice were cured of their primary subcutaneous (5  104 cells) 4T1
tumors with either TrimAb (14 of 15 by day 20) or TrimAb and
IL-21 (14 of 15 by day 24; Fig. 6). Approximately, 10 weeks later,
mice cured of their primary tumors were rechallenged with 5  104,
2  105, and 1  106 4T1 cells in the opposite flank. Tumors grew in
all naive mice at all of these doses with no mice surviving
rechallenge (Fig. 6). Whereas all mice initially cured with TrimAb
also resisted tumor rechallenge at 5  104 4T1 cells, three of five
mice receiving 2  105 4T1 cells developed tumors and all mice
receiving 1  106 4T1 cells developed tumors albeit with a
significantly reduced growth rate. By contrast, memory to tumor
was greater in mice cured with TrimAb and IL-21 because all these
mice resisted tumor rechallenge at 2  105 and 5  104 4T1 tumor
cells, and one of four mice receiving 1  106 4T1 tumor cells
remained tumor-free. These data suggested that IL-21 not only
improved primary responses to tumor stimulated by TrimAb, but
also enhanced T-cell memory to a secondary challenge.

Discussion
Cancer immunotherapies are becoming increasingly effective as
our understanding of tumor immunity advances. Even a relatively
short time ago, immunotherapies were effective only in a prophylactic setting (21) or against relatively small metastases (22, 23)
or tumors bearing foreign antigens (24–26). Improved approaches
led to growth inhibition of more established syngeneic tumors, but
eradication of large solid tumors or advanced spontaneously
metastatic disease was not widely possible. With further advances

Combination IL-21 Immunotherapy

in our understanding of many aspects of immunology including
antigen presentation, T-cell costimulation, and memory formation,
and as new cytokines and immune system agonists have become
available, progress has been made in the immunotherapy of cancer.
Recently, complete regression of large syngeneic solid tumors has
been shown using combination immunotherapies in a mouse
melanoma model (27). It is becoming clear that rationally chosen
combinations of immunomodulators offer great potential for
effective treatment of established malignant disease.
In the current study described above, we have used IL-21 in
combination with antibodies inducing tumor cell apoptosis and
immune cell activation and showed complete regression of
advanced solid breast tumors. Furthermore, the efficacy of this
combination therapy and its reliance on IL-21 was shown for other
advanced tumors including renal cancer and colon cancer. In
addition, we were able to completely eradicate advanced

Figure 6. IL-21 promotes enhanced tumor-specific memory. Groups of 5 to 15
BALB/c WT mice were inoculated into the mammary fat pad with 5  104
4T1 tumor cells (day 0). Groups of mice were then treated i.p. with either 100 Ag
cIg on days 7 and 11 and PBS on days 14, 15, and 16; 100 Ag each of
TrimAb on days 7 and 11 and PBS on days 14, 15, and 16; or combinations
of TrimAb and IL-21 at similar times as indicated. Mice treated with either TrimAb
and PBS (open circles ) or TrimAb and IL-21 (closed circles ) that remained
tumor-free of their primary 4T1 tumor were then rechallenged s.c. in the opposite
flank 10 wk after the primary tumor inoculation with increasing doses of 4T1
tumor cells: A, 1  106; B, 2  105; and C, 5  104 cells, as shown. Growth
after rechallenge was compared with growth at the same doses in naı̈ve BALB/c
WT mice (open squares ). In primary and secondary challenge experiments,
4T1 tumor growth was measured every second day and tumor sizes represent
the mean F SE of four to five mice in each group. The proportion of mice

widespread spontaneously metastatic breast cancer in the majority
of mice treated with this regimen. Inclusion of IL-21 in treatment
regimens was found to be necessary for optimal effect in all three
tumor models.
The TrimAb component of the therapy is thought to operate
through the coordination of three molecular and cellular pathways,
each stimulated by individual antibodies comprising the TrimAb
formulation (15). Early tumor cell apoptosis is mediated by antiDR5, and as determined by TUNEL analysis, this is not enhanced

further by the TrimAb combination (data not shown). Furthermore,
tumor suppression by anti-DR5 or TrimAb is inhibited by tumor
FLIP overexpression (15). Thus, anti-DR5 mAb induces apoptosis of
a proportion of tumor cells, thereby releasing potential tumor
antigens. These antigens are then presented to T cells by APCs that
are activated and matured by anti-CD40 mAb. T cells in turn are
activated by licensed APCs and further costimulated by the agonist
anti-CD137 mAb, resulting in a robust adaptive immune response
against tumor. When IL-21 was used in this setting, a further
enhanced antitumor response was observed.
It was previously shown that CD8+ T cells and the cytokines, IFNg and IL-12, were required for the antitumor activity of TrimAb. In
an earlier study treatment, efficacy correlated with tumor-specific
CD8+ T cells producing IFN-g in the tumor draining lymph node
(15). In the current study, these same requirements were necessary
for the enhanced effect afforded by the addition of IL-21 to the
treatment regimen, but we did not observe any increase in draining
lymph node CD8+ T cells producing IFN-g (data not shown). It was
also interesting that a similar number of mice were cured after
treatment with two doses of TrimAb/IL-21 and four doses of
TrimAb alone. This suggested that IL-21 amplified at least part of
the same mechanism used by TrimAb therapy. Notably IL-21 can
enhance perforin expression in CD8+ T cells (28) and NK cells (4),
but there seemed no greater dependence on this effector pathway
than observed in mice receiving TrimAb alone. Most likely, the
effect of IL-21 occurred at the level of activation or expansion of
CD8+ T cells, because IL-21 has been shown to promote proliferation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo (refs.
10, 29; reviewed in ref. 30). In addition, IL-21 has been shown to
promote antitumor CTL activity in mice (31) and, in synergy with
IL-15, can enhance the expansion of naive and memory CD8+ T
cells (32). The effectiveness of the therapeutic regimen against
tumors of various histologic origins suggests that immunity can be
generated and enhanced against a variety of tumor antigens using
the TrimAb and IL-21 combination. One of the aims of cancer
immunotherapy is the ability to induce lasting tumor-specific
immunity. In our studies, we also showed enhanced tumor-specific
memory of mice after treatment with the TrimAb/IL-21 combination compared with TrimAb alone.
IL-21 can also induce maturation and activation of NK cells,
thereby increasing their cytolytic potential (4), with induction of
various genes involved in the activation of innate immune
responses. IL-21 also enhances ADCC by NK cells and can lead

to secretion of IFN-g, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-8, macrophage
inflammatory protein-1a, and RANTES and an enhanced antitumor effect (12). This mechanism may well be responsible for
the observed modest activity of IL-21 alone against tumor in the
absence of additional immune stimulation. However, it seems
unlikely that this mechanism plays a major role in augmenting
TrimAb activity because depletion of NK cells did not affect significantly antitumor activity.
IL-21 has been shown to play a role in CD4+ T-helper cell
differentiation, with reports that Th1 and Th2 responses can be
elicited in human and mouse systems (33, 34). In addition, IL-21
plays a key role in the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into
Th17 cells (35, 36) that promote inflammatory responses and plays
a pivotal role in autoimmunity. It is likely that the end result of
IL-21 signaling on T-helper cell differentiation is dependent upon
the context in which it operates. However, in the therapy setting
described in the current report, there seems little contribution
from T-helper cells because depletion of CD4+ T cells did not affect
the increased therapeutic effect afforded by IL-21. Nevertheless, the
mechanistic studies described above are not sufficient to exclude a
role for IL-21 in the inhibition of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg).
Indeed, IL-21 has been previously shown to inhibit transforming
growth factor-h–driven differentiation of naive T-helper cells into
Foxp3+ Treg cells (35, 36), and IL-21–mediated FoxP3 suppression
leads to enhanced CTL generation (37). IL-21 can also enable CD4+
T-helper cells to become resistant to the suppressive effects of Treg
without directly reversing the function of CD4+CD25+ Treg (38).
In summary, we show that sequentially combining TrimAb with
recombinant IL-21 can significantly improve the antitumor activity
of this combination against very advanced disease in a number of
experimental tumor models. Whereas clinically it will be important
to try to simplify combination therapy strategies by minimizing the
number of agents used, these data further supports the use of IL-21
in adjuvant settings where improved cellular immune responses to
tumors are desired and achievable.
