Valproic Acid for the Treatment of Myeloid
Malignancies

W

e read with interest Drs. Kuendgen and Gattermann’s recent
review on valproic acid (VPA) for the treatment of myeloid
malignancies.1 We suggest that response to VPA in myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) patients may be underestimated in current literature because of relatively short durations of treatment in published
studies.2
At our institution, we conducted a pilot study of VPA monotherapy in MDS.3 Patient response was assessed after 4–6 weeks of VPA
at serum concentrations of 50–100 mg/mL. Of evaluable patients
(n ¼ 15), 4 (27%) showed hematologic improvement (HI) per International Working Group criteria,4 with responses seen only in
patients with low-risk disease, consistent with results of Kuendgen
et al.1,2
One such subject, a 38-year-old female with no signiﬁcant past
medical history, presented with a 50-lb weight loss and symptomatic anemia. A diagnostic bone marrow revealed myelodysplastic
syndrome-refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (MDSRCMD). Her International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score
was 0 (3% blasts on aspirate; normal female karyotype; Hg, 9.3).
She required red cell (PRBC) transfusions every 3 weeks. During
Months 1–7 of VPA therapy, her median Hg rose to 9.8; she received
1 PRBC transfusion. Between Months 7–12 of therapy, her hemoglobin improved by an additional 3.1 g/dL. She reported increased
energy and appetite and demonstrated a 23-lb weight gain. Her
response at 4–6 weeks was characterized as HI-erythroid.4 Her best
response to VPA, a complete peripheral blood remission, occurred,
however, after 7.5 months of continuous therapy and is sustained,
now 32 months after initiation of therapy, with a median Hg of 13.2
during the last 2 years.
Our experience with VPA suggests that sustained responses to
VPA monotherapy are possible; furthermore, similar to other epigenetic agents used in MDS, responses to VPA may not be apparent
for months.5 Patients with stable disease and minor responses may
need treatment for longer durations before a ﬁnal assessment is
made. This observation may be important in designing future VPA
and other HDAC-I studies for low-risk MDS patients.

Reply to Valproic Acid for the
Treatment of Myeloid Malignancies

W

e read with interest the letter by Dr. Shah, who
reported a late response to treatment with valproic acid (VPA). He suggested that the frequency of
responses to VPA may be underestimated because of
short treatment duration.
In our trial, median treatment duration was 4
months. Median time to response was 29 days
(range, 13 days to 96 days).1 This is not much different from the time to ﬁrst response seen by Dr. Shah
(4 weeks to 6 weeks). Although most responses to
VPA seem to occur relatively early, treatment results
with other drugs, including thalidomide, ATG, and
demethylating agents,2,3,4 suggest that trials in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients should continue for at least 3 to 4 months.
The following patient, who was seen at Elisabethinen Hospital in Linz, also showed a protracted
increase in hemoglobin on VPA. Interestingly, this
patient responded to low dosages and remained
stable even after discontinuation.
This 32-year old woman presented with macrocytic anemia (Hb 6.8 g/dL; MCV 115.2 fL; WBC
3,900/mL; Plt 429,000/mL). Bone marrow biopsy (September 3, 2004) yielded a hypocellular, dysplastic
marrow with trilineage dysplasia. Cytogenetics were
normal. Serum erythropoietin was 297 mU/mL.
Because erythropoiesis appeared hypoplastic, immunosuppressive treatment with rituximab (4  375
mg/m2) and prednisolone (50 mg/d) was started at

2325

another hospital (September 30, 2004) but proved
unsuccessful. Subsequently, transfusion therapy was
required (1–2 units of PRC/month).
The patient then came to Elisabethinen Hospital,
where VPA treatment was initiated (March 18, 2005),
at 600 mg/d. In June 2005, hemoglobin levels slowly
increased until December 2005, when normal values
were achieved (15.3 g/dL). Bone marrow biopsy
showed a normocellular marrow with few dysplastic
changes. Considering her normal blood counts, this
patient ﬁrst decreased the VPA dosage to 300 mg/d
(December 2006) and then stopped treatment (June
1, 2006) against her physician’s advice. Fortunately,
bone marrow biopsy in June 2007 did not show any
deterioration, and blood counts remained stable
(Hb 15.4 g/dL; MCV 89.9 fL; WBC 4,700/mL; Plt
143,000/mL).
The report by Shah et al, describing a long-lasting response to VPA, supports our conclusion that
VPA is a useful drug in low-risk MDS. In our trial, 5
responders in the low-risk group are still on treatment at 38, 47, 53, 56, and 63 months. Of note, these
responses were achieved with relatively low doses
(median, 1500 mg/d). It would be interesting to see
whether responses can be maintained with even
lower doses.
