Abstract
Human adipose tissue–derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSC) are considered to be a promising source of autologous
stem cells in personalized cell-based therapies. Tumor
tracking properties of MSC provide an attractive opportunity
for targeted transgene delivery into the sites of tumor
formation. In the present study, we addressed whether the
suicide gene introduction into human AT-MSC could produce
a tumor-specific prodrug converting cellular vehicle for
targeted chemotherapy. We prepared yeast fusion cytosine
deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyltransferase gene–expressing
cells [cytosine deaminase (CD)–expressing AT-MSC (CD-ATMSC)] by retrovirus transduction. We explored their therapeutic potential on a model of human colon cancer in the
presence of prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). Gene manipulation of human AT-MSC did not sensitize CD-AT-MSC to 5-FC,
thus overcoming the inherent disadvantage of suicide effect
on cellular vehicle. CD-AT-MSC in combination with 5-FC
augmented the bystander effect and selective cytotoxicity on
target tumor cells HT-29 in direct coculture in vitro. We
confirmed directed migration ability of AT-MSC and CD-ATMSC toward tumor cells HT-29 in vitro. Moreover, we achieved
significant inhibition of s.c. tumor xenograft growth by s.c. or
i.v. administered CD-AT-MSC in immunocompromised mice
treated with 5-FC. We confirmed the ability of CD-AT-MSC to
deliver the CD transgene to the site of tumor formation and
mediate strong antitumor effect in vivo. Taken together, these
data characterize MSC derived from adipose tissue as suitable
delivery vehicles for prodrug converting gene and show their
utility for a personalized cell-based targeted cancer gene
therapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6304–13]

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies.
Major cause of death associated with this type of cancer can be
attributed to the development of metastasis in liver, abdominal
lymph nodes, and lung (1). Prognosis remains poor for most
patients although treated with the most effective chemotherapy of
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is a cornerstone of metastatic
colorectal cancer treatment (2). This widely used anticancer agent
has its limits: serious side effect and high dose levels required for
the response. Therefore, it seems as though the metastatic colon
cancer disease therapy requires development of novel strategies

and could be a good target for molecular chemotherapy
approaches (3).
High systemic toxicity of 5-FU could be circumvented by
introducing gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy relying on the
ability of bacterial and/or yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) enzyme
to convert far less toxic substrate 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to 5-FU.
5-FU is capable of nonfacilitated diffusion into and out of cells
resulting in significant bystander effect of CD/5-FC (4). Antitumor
effect of CD/5-FC combination on colon carcinoma was shown
both in vitro and in vivo, and clinical trials reported safety of
the CD/5-FC combination (5). We extended these observations to
the breast cancer cells in our previous experiments and observed
high sensitivity of retroviral-transduced breast cancer cells with
bacterial CD to 5-FC as well as a significant bystander effect in vitro
(6). However, promising experimental results were not translated
into significant curative effect in patients mostly due to low
expression of therapeutic transgene bringing only slight therapeutic benefit (7).
There were several attempts to increase the efficiency of CD/5-FC
therapy by achieving higher conversion of prodrug 5-FC to 5-FU and
the toxic metabolites production. Yeast CD was shown to produce
15-fold higher amount of 5-FU compared with bacterial CD (8).
Moreover, construction of bifunctional fusion gene CD::uracil
phosphoribosyltransferase (CD::UPRT) was reported to shortcut
rate-limiting enzymatic steps of the 5-FC/5-FU conversion,
thus resulting in 10,000-fold sensitization of transgene-expressing
cells to 5-FC compared with unmanipulated counterparts (9). As
expected, fusion yeast CD::UPRT gene-mediated prodrug conversion
therapy led to effective direct and bystander tumor cell killing
translated to significant antitumor effect in experimental animals
in vivo (10, 11).
Nevertheless, successful gene therapy technology relies on the
delivery of the therapeutic product into appropriate target cells.
Introduction of transgene of interest into autologous stem cell
types poses an attractive cell-based delivery strategy. Unique
biology of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) predetermines them
to become valuable cytoreagents for gene therapy approaches in
future (12). MSC can be relatively easily transduced with
adenoviral, oncoretroviral, and lentiviral vectors, which is a key
prerequisite for the introduction and durable expression of marker
and/or therapeutic genes in MSC (13, 14).
Furthermore, MSC on systemic administration were reported to
possess intrinsic preferential migratory ability toward some
tumor types (15–19). Human bone marrow–derived MSC after
systemic i.v. administration could migrate and engraft into
microscopic tumor lesions during early stage of development as
shown for the s.c. tumors originated from human colon cancer
cells HT-29 (20). Possible mechanism of preferential MSC homing
and engraftment into the tumor mass can be attributed to the
necessity of tumor stroma formation including tissue remodeling
with high proliferation of MSC during the process of tumor

growth (21). Exogenously administered MSC could form a
significant proportion of tumor mass (19, 20); thus, their gene
modification could be exploited for both tracking the sites of
metastasis formation and, more importantly, for the tumor sitespecific delivery of gene products to eliminate tumor.
Strong antitumor effect mediated by MSC producing therapeutic
cytokines, such as IFN-h (16, 18, 19) and interleukin-2 (17, 22), was
reported. MSC were tested as delivery vehicles for oncolytic
adenoviruses in an ovarian and breast metastatic model, and
authors report decrease in tumor burden (23, 24). Taken together,
these studies have shown the endogenous tumor tracing capability
of BM-MSC and their therapeutic potential for specific targeting of
invasive and malignant tumors.
Adipose tissue, like bone marrow, is a mesodermally derived
organ that was shown to contain stem cells (25). This population
termed adipose tissue–derived MSC (AT-MSC) shares many of the
characteristics of their bone marrow counterpart, including
morphology, extensive proliferation potential, and the ability to
undergo multilineage differentiation (26–28). The success rate of
AT-MSC isolation was 100% with the highest colony frequency
observed (26). The yield of MSC from adipose tissue was f40-fold
higher compared with the bone marrow (26). Last but not least to
consider with the regard to the source of autologous stem cells for
personalized cell-based therapy is the minimal risk to the donor
and no ethical concerns (29).
In the present study, we address the capability of human ATMSC to serve as vehicles for a cell-based gene-directed enzyme
prodrug conversion approach to targeted chemotherapy. Here, we
present a generally applicable strategy to specifically track the sites
of tumor formation even at the stage of micrometastasis and target
them by site-specific production of chemotherapeutic agent. In this
pilot study, we show that MSC derived from adipose tissue
expressing fusion yeast CD::UPRT gene [CD-expressing AT-MSC
(CD-AT-MSC)] in combination with prodrug 5-FC augment potent
cytotoxic effect over tumor cells HT-29 in vitro. Moreover, CD-ATMSC were capable of significant inhibition of tumor growth in a
therapeutic paradigm in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and chemicals. Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29
was purchased from European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC
no. 91072201). HT-29 and human fibroblasts (kindly provided by Dr. J. Bizik,
Cancer Research Institute Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia)
were cultured in RPMI 1640 and retroviral packaging mouse cell lines GP+E86 and GP+envAM12 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Bies, National Cancer
Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
5% FCS and Antibiotic-Antimycotic mix (Life Technologies) in humidified
atmosphere and 5% CO2 at 37jC.
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma if not stated otherwise.
Construction of retroviral vector containing CD. Construction of
recombinant retrovirus was done by standard PCR cloning. Synthetic fusion
yeast CD::UPRT gene was digested from expression vector pORF5-Fcy::Fur
(InvivoGen) and inserted into retrovirus vector backbone from plasmid
pJZ308 (30). Retrovirus vector obtained is a bicistronic construct with
fusion yeast CD::UPRT gene separated by internal ribosome entry site
sequence from neo gene. Resulting plasmid pST2 was sequenced to verify
the correct reading frame and DNA sequence.
Preparation of virus-producing cells. GP+E-86 cells were transfected
with 1 Ag pST2 plasmid using Effectene (Qiagen). Virus-containing medium
from G418-resistant GP+E-86/pST2 cells supplemented with 100 Ag/mL
protamine sulfate was used to transduce GP+envAM12 cells. Medium
from G418-resistant cells GP+envAM12/pST2 was used to transduce back

www.aacrjournals.org

GP+E-86/pST2. Three to five rounds of repeated transduction were done to
obtain cells producing recombinant retrovirus particles with mixed
envelope glycoproteins as described (6). Activity of reverse transcriptase
in a virus-containing medium was measured by standard reverse
transcriptase assay (6).
Virus-containing medium for transduction was collected from semiconfluent cultures of GP+envAM12/pST2 cells incubated in fresh culture
medium for 24 h, filtered through 0.45-Am filters, and used either fresh or
kept frozen at 80jC until use.
MSC isolation from human adipose tissue, culture, and retrovirus
transduction. AT-MSC cells were isolated from lipoaspirate using a
collagenase type VII digestion and plastic adherence technique as described
(31). Material was obtained from healthy persons undergoing elective
lipoaspiration, who provided an informed consent. Cells were plated in lowglucose (1,000 mg/L) DMEM supplemented with 10% MSC-stimulatory
supplement (human; StemCell Technologies) and antibiotic-antimycotic at
a density of 2  105 to 5  105 nucleated cells/cm2. Adherent cells were split
on reaching confluence and AT-MSC were used for the experiments up to
passage 5.
To prepare MSC expressing CD (CD-AT-MSC), subconfluent cultures of
AT-MSC were transduced thrice in 3 consecutive days with virus-containing
medium from GP+envAM12/pST2 cells supplemented with 100 Ag/mL
protamine sulfate. The same method was used to prepare human fibroblasts
expressing CD (CD-Fib).
Expression of CD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and
octomer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4) in MSC. Total RNA was
isolated from 2  106 cells by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and treated with
RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed with RevertAid H
Minus First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas). cDNA (200 ng) was
subject to standard PCR with 35 cycles and gel was resolved on 2% agarose.
Real-time PCR was done in 1 PCR Master Mix (Fermentas), 2.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.16 Amol/L primers, 1 SYBR Green (Molecular Probes), and 200
ng template cDNA on RotorGene 2000 (Corbett Research) and analyzed by
RotorGene software version 4.6. Gene expression was compared using D
cycle threshold (DC t = C tOct-4 C tGAPDH) values for cells examined, where
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression was taken
as endogenous reference gene. Change in gene expression was evaluated by
D-D (DD)C t method according to the following formula: DDC t = [C tOct-4(CDC tGAPDH(CD-AT-MSC)]
[C tOct-4(AT-MSC)
C tGAPDH(AT-MSC)].
AT-MSC)
Analysis was done twice in triplicates and data were expressed as
mean F SE.
The following primers were used: 5¶-ATGGACATTGCCTATGAGGA-3¶
(FcyFor) and 5¶-TTCTCCAGGGTGCTGATCTC-3¶ (FcyRev) for CD (167 bp);
5¶-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3¶ (GAPDHFor) and 5¶-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3¶ (GAPDHRev) for GAPDH (226 bp); and 5¶-ACATCAAAGCTCTGCAGAAAGAACT-3¶ (Oct-4For) and 5¶-CTGAATACCTTCCCA
AATAGAACCC-3¶ (Oct-4Rev) for transcription factor (Oct-4; 133 bp).
Spectrophotometric measurement of 5-FC conversion. CD enzyme
activity was measured spectrophotometrically (6). Cells (5  105) were
resuspended in 50 AL PBS and lysed by five cycles of rapid freeze-and-thaw
in liquid nitrogen. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4jC.
Clear supernatant (30 AL) was mixed with 30 AL of 0.4 mg/mL 5-FC in PBS
and incubated at 37jC. Aliquots (10 AL) were taken at each time point,
quenched with 90 AL of 0.1 mol/L HCl, spectrophotometrically evaluated
on NanoDrop-1000, and analyzed by NanoDrop software ND-1000 3.3.0.
Enzymatic conversion of 5-FC was calculated as percentage of 5-FC
remaining in cell lysate based on following equation: 5-FC remaining (%) =
[0.119  A 290(0) 0.025  A 255(0)] [0.119  A 290(x) 0.025  A 255(x)] /
[0.119  A 290(0) 0.025  A 255(0)], where A 290(0) and A 255(0) are starting
absorbance values (time point 0) at 290 and 255 nm, respectively, and
A 290(x) and A 255(x) are absorbance values at x hours at 290 and 255 nm,
respectively. Conversion of 5-FC is expressed as mean of triplicates F SE
and indicates percentage of starting 5-FC concentration that was set to
100% by default.
Immunophenotyping. MSC and HT-29 were labeled with the following
antihuman antibodies conjugated to FITC: CD14-FITC, CD34-FITC,
CD44-FITC, CD45-FITC, and CD105-FITC (purchased from Santa Cruz

Biotechnology) and CD29-FITC and CD90-FITC (purchased from Chemicon). Mouse isotype antibodies IgG1 and IgG2a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
served as respective controls. Labeled cells were analyzed using an EPICS
ALTRA flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) equipped with Expo 32 program.
MSC differentiation. Cultured AT-MSC and CD-AT-MSC were tested for
the ability to differentiate into adipogenic cell lineage as described by Colter
et al. (32) with modifications. Briefly, 5  103 cells per well in 96-well plates
were grown in standard culture medium for 48 to 72 h. Cells were switched
to differentiation medium composed of a-MEM medium supplemented
with 15% FCS, antibiotics, 0.5 Amol/L hydrocortisone, 0.5 mmol/L
isobutylmethylxanthine, and 60 Amol/L indomethacin for 28 days. Cells
were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formalin for 1 h, and stained for 15 min
with fresh Oil Red-O solution (Fisher Scientific). Adipogenic differentiation
was confirmed based on the detection of cells containing well-stained oil
droplets.
For osteogenic differentiation, 103 cells per well in 96-well plates were
grown in standard culture medium for 48 to 72 h followed by incubation in
osteogenic medium using Osteogenic stem cells kit (StemCell Technologies).
Medium a-MEM was supplemented with 15% osteogenic-stimulatory
supplements (human), 10 8 mol/L dexamethasone, 0.2 mmol/L ascorbic
acid, and 10 mmol/L h-glycerolphosphate. Medium was replaced every 3 to
4 days for 28 days. Cultures were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formalin for
1 h, and stained for 10 min with 1 mL of 40 mmol/L Alizarin red (pH 4.3).
Osteogenic differentiation was confirmed by detection of red-stained
calcium deposits.
Cell invasion assays. The tropism of MSC for tumor cells was
determined using a Cell invasion assay kit (Chemicon). HT-29 cells or
fibroblasts (1.5  104) were loaded in the lower well of the 24-well plates
24 h before the experiment start. MSC (105 cells) in serum-free medium
were placed onto the 8-Am pore size inserts coated with ECMatrix. Lower
wells containing cells were washed with PBS, filled with serum-free
medium, assembled for the migration assay, and incubated for 48 h.
Noninvading cells and ECMatrix were wiped away from the inside of the
insert, cells were stained for 20 min, and invading cells were photographed
through the microscope. Results were evaluated by directly counting the
number of migrated cells in five fields and by calculating the mean.
Experiments were repeated twice with similar results.

Cell proliferation assays. Triplicates of MSC and HT-29 (3,000 cells per
well) for each treatment were plated into 96-well plates and incubated
overnight at 37jC. Culture medium was replaced for medium containing
0 to 500 Ag/mL 5-FC or 0 to 1,000 Ag/mL 5-FU 24 h later. Five days later,
plates were subjected to the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega) and read out spectrophotometrically at
490 nm. Results were expressed as the percentage of proliferation, where the
proliferation of cells in culture medium without 5-FC or 5-FU was set to
100%. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.
Direct coculture of HT-29 cells and MSC in vitro. Quadruplicates of
HT-29 cells (5  103) were plated in 96-well plates. Increasing amounts of
either CD-AT-MSC or AT-MSC (50, 100, 250, 375, 500, 1,000, and 2,500) were
added to the tumor cells on day 1. 5-FC (100 Ag/mL) was added to the
mixed cultures on day 2. Cells were incubated with or without 5-FC for
5 days and cell viability was measured by standard proliferation assay.
HT-29 cell viability without MSC in medium with or without 5-FC was set to
100%. Experimental values are expressed as mean percentage of control
viability F SE.
In prolonged direct coculture experiments, HT-29 tumor cells (105/6-cm
dish) and CD-AT-MSC (2.5  104/6-cm dish) were cultured either alone or
mixed in the medium supplemented with 100 Ag/mL 5-FC for 20 days.
Medium was changed every 3 days. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol,
stained with H&E, and photographed through microscope. Experiments
were repeated thrice with similar results.
Animal experiments. Six- to eight-week-old female athymic nude mice
(BALB/c-nu/nu) were used for the in vivo experiments in accordance with
institutional guidelines under the approved protocols. Cells were administered as suspension of 2.5  105 HT-29 cells in 100 AL PBS s.c. into the
flank in the control animals. In coinjection studies, the following cell
suspensions were injected s.c.: 2.5  105 HT-29 + 2.5  105 CD-AT-MSC,
2.5  105 HT-29 + 2.5  104 CD-AT-MSC, 2.5  105 HT-29 + 2.5  105 ATMSC, and 2.5  105 HT-29 + 2.5  104 AT-MSC (in 100 AL PBS/each animal).
Suspension of 106 AT-MSC, 106 CD-AT-MSC, or 106 CD-Fib in 200 AL PBS
or 200 AL PBS/each animal was injected i.v. into the lateral tail vein for the
systemic administration.
Animals were treated with 500 mg/kg/d 5-FC diluted in PBS i.p. in two
rounds of 5 consecutive days with 2-day break where indicated.

RNA from cultured AT-MSC and CD-AT-MSC was reverse transcribed and PCR amplified for 35 cycles. Presence of specific transcripts was confirmed by gel
resolution. GAPDH served as RNA integrity control. CD is expressed in transduced CD-AT-MSC and not in cultured AT-MSC as expected, and Oct-4 is expressed
in both CD-AT-MSC and AT-MSC. B, level of Oct-4 transcription factor expression in CD-AT-MSC and AT-MSC was compared by real-time quantitative PCR
using SYBR Green dye. GAPDH was used as endogenous reference gene. Comparison of D cycle threshold (DC t = C tOct-4 C tGAPDH) values for CD-AT-MSC and
AT-MSC showed no significant difference in the level of Oct-4 expression. C, cell lysates prepared from cultured AT-MSC, CD-AT-MSC, and tumor cells HT-29 were
mixed with 0.4 mg/mL 5-FC in PBS and incubated at 37jC for indicated time points. Aliquots were quenched with 0.1 mol/L HCl and evaluated spectrophotometrically.

initial weight. At the experiment end point, animals were sacrificed, and
tumors were excised and weighted for tumor burden. Results were
evaluated as mean of tumor volume or weight F SE. To detect CD

Analysis of tumor targeting. To detect MSC by fluorescence, AT-MSC
were labeled with fluorescent dye CFDA-SE using Vybrant CFDA-SE Cell
Tracer kit (Molecular Probes). AT-MSC suspension (106 cells/mL) in serumfree medium was supplemented with CFDA-SE (10 mmol/L), incubated for

with primers specific for human repetitive Alu sequences [5¶-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCC-3¶ (Alu S) and 5¶-TCCTGCCTCAGCCTCCCAAG3¶(AluA)] to obtain 124-bp product.
For CD quantification, 200 ng of isolated DNA were subjected to
quantitative real-time PCR with primers FcyFor and FcyRev specific for
CD gene under same conditions as described for cDNA. Standard curve for
CD-positive cells was prepared from DNA samples with known proportion
of CD-AT-MSC cells (10%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, and 0.05%) mixed with HT-29
cells. The proportion of CD-positive cells in tumors was extrapolated from
this linear standard curve and the C t values for each sample. Analysis was
done thrice in triplicates and data were expressed as mean F SE.
Statistics. Values were calculated as mean F SE or expressed as mean
percentage of control F SE. Significant differences were determined using
Mann-Whitney U test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Transgene expression and enzymatic activity in CD-AT-MSC.
Retrovirus-transduced human MSC derived from adipose tissue
expressing CD::UPRT transgene (CD-AT-MSC) were prepared. CD
was expressed in CD-AT-MSC and not in cultured untransduced
AT-MSC by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; ref. Fig. 1A).
Enzymatic conversion of prodrug 5-FC was confirmed in cell
lysates prepared from CD-AT-MSC (Fig. 1C). There was not any 5FC converting activity in cell lysates from either unmanipulated
AT-MSC or HT-29 tumor cells. We estimated that f60% of 5-FC
was converted within 24 h, thus showing effective enzymatic
activity of transgene.
Stem cell properties of CD-AT-MSC are not affected by
retrovirus transduction and transgene expression. To confirm
that culture expansion, manipulation, and retroviral transduction
did not change stem cell properties of CD-AT-MSC, experiments
were done to compare CD-AT-MSC with cultured AT-MSC. First,
we found no change in the expression of pluripotent embryonic
transcription factor Oct-4 on transduction (DDC t = 0.35 F 0.214).
Both CD-AT-MSC and AT-MSC express Oct-4 indicative of
undifferentated state and high proliferative capacity preservation
(Fig. 1A and B). Moreover, we analyzed AT-MSC and CD-AT-MSC
immunophenotype by standard flow cytometry to search for the
potential surface marker expression change. Both cell types were
found to be consistently positive for CD29, CD44, CD90, and CD105
(Fig. 2A) and negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45. Both CD-AT-MSC
and cultured AT-MSC were capable of differentiation into
adipogenic (Fig. 2B) and osteogenic lineages (Fig. 2C) with no
significant difference. Taken together, these results suggest that
transgene introduction does not affect any of stem cell characteristics examined in CD-AT-MSC.
Migration toward tumor cells HT-29 in vitro. We hypothesized that the migration capability toward the tumor cells was a
prerequisite for the AT-MSC to specifically target tumor cells.
Directional migration of AT-MSC through ECMatrix was significantly stimulated by human colon adenocarcinoma cells HT-29
cells in vitro [72.3 F 12.2 migrated cells compared with control
(25 F 9.3)]. Migration capacity was not affected by transgene
expression in CD-AT-MSC (67 F 13 cells; Fig. 2D). The same results
were obtained, when the assay was done with tumor cells HT-29
conditioned serum-free medium used as chemoattractant.
Effect of 5-FC and 5-FU on cell proliferation. Chemosensitivity of AT-MSC, CD-AT-MSC, and HT-29 cells to 5-FC and
5-FU was analyzed by cell proliferation assay. 5-FC is relatively
nontoxic, and even at high concentrations up to 500 Ag/mL, it did
not affect HT-29 or MSC cell proliferation (Fig. 3A). CD expression
sensitized CD-AT-MSC to 5-FC at highest concentration only,

Figure 4. Local 5-FC conversion in tumors mediated by therapeutic CD-ATMSC is effective in tumor growth inhibition in vivo. A, mixtures of HT-29 tumor
cells (2.5  105) with CD-AT-MSC (2.5  105 and 2.5  104) and AT-MSC
(2.5  105 and 2.5  104) were injected s.c. into flank of each nude mouse
(n = 6/each treatment group) to induce tumors. Tumors induced by HT-29 cells
alone (2.5  105) s.c. were used as control (n = 9). All animals were treated
with daily dose of 500 mg/kg 5-FC i.p. for 5 consecutive days starting at day 3
after implantation. Second round of 5-FC treatment was started at day 10 after
implantation. At day 18, animals were sacrificed, and tumors were excised and
weighted. B, coinjection of 1:10 or 1:1 AT-MSC+HT-29 resulted in the growth of
tumors in all 6 of 6 experimental animals showing some tendency to support
growth of tumors compared with induction with HT-29 cell alone (9 of 9 animals
injected developed tumors). On the other hand, both groups coinjected with
CD-AT-MSC+HT-29/5-FC exhibited strong inhibition of tumor growth. Five
of 6 animals coinjected with 1:1 CD-AT-MSC+HT-29/5-FC developed
tumors, and only 2 of 6 animals coinjected with 1:10 CD-AT-MSC+HT-29/5FC developed tumors by the experiment end point. Points, mean tumor

were very sensitive to 5-FU with IC50(HT-29) of 7 Ag/mL 5-FU.
AT-MSC were 128.6-fold more resistant with the IC50(AT-MSC) of
900 Ag/mL 5-FU. Transgene expression sensitized CD-AT-MSC to
5-FU 2.5-fold with IC50(CD-AT-MSC) of 360 Ag/mL 5-FU. However,
even at high concentration of 100 Ag/mL 5-FU, proliferation of
CD-AT-MSC remained 56.6% and AT-MSC 58.6% in contrast to
only 6.7% in HT-29 cells (Fig. 3B). This finding indicated the
capacity of MSC to overcome the inherent disadvantage of suicide
effect on cellular vehicles.
Selective cytotoxicity toward tumor HT-29 cells mediated by
CD-AT-MSC in the presence of 5-FC in vitro. Therapeutic
potential of CD-AT-MSC was evaluated in direct coculture experiments in vitro. CD-AT-MSC were cocultured with tumor HT-29 cells
in the presence of prodrug 5-FC. They exert strong selective
cytotoxic effect over HT-29 cells, even if the ratio was as low as
1:100 (P = 0.05; Fig. 3C). No inhibitory effect was observed without
5-FC or CD in cocultures. Prolonged direct coculture (20 days)
showed complete eradication of tumor cells (Fig. 3D, left). However,
CD-AT-MSC could withstand the effect of 5-FU and its toxic
metabolites produced (Fig. 3D, middle). Chemoresistance of the
CD-AT-MSC could not be attributed to the loss of transgene
because the presence of CD-specific transcripts in these cells
was confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown). Moreover, HT-29
cells could proliferate intensively under these culture conditions
(Fig. 3D, right).
CD-AT-MSC mediated tumor growth inhibition in vivo. To
test the proposed approach in vivo, mixtures of tumor cells HT-29
with 10% and 50% MSC were injected in nude mice s.c. treated with
5-FC (500 mg/kg/d) i.p. (Fig. 4A). Significant inhibition of tumor
growth was observed in animals treated with 10% or 50% CD-ATMSC (Fig. 4B). The outcome shows that only 10% CD-positive cells
within the tumor mass could inhibit tumor growth by f79% by the
experiment end point time showing strong bystander effect in vivo.
All animals injected with HT-29 alone or mixed with AT-MSC

developed tumors (Fig. 4C, left flank). In contrast, CD-AT-MSC–
treated animals did not always develop tumor and if present, it was
always smaller at the experiment end point (Fig. 4C, right flank).
Comparison of tumor burden showed 73.8% and 78.4% tumor
inhibition in the therapeutic regimen CD-AT-MSC+HT-29/5-FC 1:1
and 1:10, respectively. (Fig. 4D).
Tumor targeting and growth inhibition on systemic administration of CD-AT-MSC in vivo. To test the tumor-directed
migratory ability of AT-MSC, fluorescently labeled AT-MSC were
injected into mice with preestablished HT-29–induced tumors i.v.
Six days after treatment, fluorescent MSC were detected located
within the tumor parenchyma (Fig. 5A). Thus, AT-MSC were
capable of localizing into tumors after systemic injection.
Moreover, to analyze other possibilities of AT-MSC homing
in vivo, animals with preestablished tumors were injected with
CD-AT-MSC i.v. and sacrificed at two different time points. Based
on PCR detection of CD transgene, CD-AT-MSC were found in
lungs and liver of some animals although at low amounts on day 9
(Fig. 5B). CD-AT-MSC were cleared away at 20 days although
consistently found in s.c. tumors.
Next, we tested whether the capability of exogenously administered CD-AT-MSC to reach the sites of s.c. tumor formation could
influence the tumor growth in a therapeutic setup in vivo. Mice
with preestablished tumors were injected with CD-AT-MSC, ATMSC, CD-Fib, and saline i.v. and 5-FC treated (Fig. 6A). Significant
inhibition of tumor growth up to 68.5% was observed in all animals
injected with CD-AT-MSC by day 18 (Fig. 6B). None of the animals
exhibited any signs of toxic side effects of therapeutic regimen. No
effect was achieved in the absence of CD or if CD-Fib were used as
delivery agents. This was ascribed to the failure of human
fibroblasts to home within the tumor mass, as confirmed by
analysis of tumor samples for the presence of CD transgene
(Fig. 6C). Detailed quantitative analysis showed that 0.87% to 3.89%
and 0.23% to 0.55% CD-AT-MSC had been incorporated within the

Figure 5. Tumor homing capabilities of AT-MSC into s.c. tumors. A, s.c. tumors were induced by s.c. injection of HT-29 cells (2.5  105) in nude mice (day 0). Cultured
AT-MSC were labeled with fluorescent dye CFDA-SE and injected i.v. into tail vein on day 3 after tumor cell inoculation. Mice were sacrificed on day 9, tumors
were snap frozen, and cryosections were examined by fluorescent microscopy. Fluorescent AT-MSC were found within the tumor parenchyma. Representative sections
of three different tumors. Magnification, 200. No fluorescent signal was visible in cryosections from control tumors. B, biodistribution of systemically administered
CD-AT-MSC was examined in various tissues at two time points. Tumors were induced with HT-29 cells (2.5  105, day 0) s.c. and transduced CD-AT-MSC (106 cells)
were injected i.v. 3 d later. As soon as the palpable tumor appeared (day 9) and at the time of experiment end point (day 20) animals were sacrificed, DNA
was isolated from lung, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, and tumor and subjected to heminested PCR (30 cycles for each amplification) to detect marker CD gene
indicative of CD-AT-MSC homing. CD-AT-MSC were found in lungs and liver in 2 of 3 animals examined at day 9, however, at very low intensity. Tumors were found
CD positive in 3 of 3 animals both at days 9 and 20. Representative result of one experimental animal. h-Actin PCR was used as a control of DNA integrity, and
DNA isolated from CD-AT-MSC was used as a control for CD-specific amplification.

Antiproliferative Effect of CD-AT-MSC/5-FC on Tumor Cells

Figure 6. Antitumor effect of systemically
administered CD-AT-MSC in the presence
of 5-FC in vivo. A, tumors were induced with
HT-29 cells (2.5  105) s.c. into the flank on
day 0. Animals (n = 6/group) were divided
into four groups according to treatment:
CD-AT-MSC (106 cells) i.v., AT-MSC
(106 cells) i.v., CD-Fib (106 cells) i.v., and
control PBS i.v. Cells were injected into the
lateral tail vein on day 3. All animals were
treated with daily dose of 500 mg/kg 5-FC
i.p. for 5 consecutive days starting at day 5.
Second round of 5-FC treatment was
started at day 12. Tumor volume was
measured by caliper regularly. B,
therapeutic regimen CD-AT-MSCi.v./5-FC
showed inhibitory effect on tumor growth in
all experimental animals. There was no
significant influence on tumor growth in
both AT-MSC i.v./5-FC– and CD-Fib
i.v./5-FC–treated animals compared with
saline control group. Columns, mean tumor
volume; bars, SE. *, P < 0.01, MannWhitney U test. C, transgene delivery
into s.c. tumor xenografts on systemic
CD-AT-MSC administration was evaluated
by PCR amplification for 35 cycles to detect
CD-specific product in isolated tumor DNA.
Tumors were induced with HT-29 cells s.c.
and CD-AT-MSC, AT-MSC, and CD-Fib
(106 cells) were administered systemically.
DNA was isolated from excised tumors on
day 9 (6 d after i.v. injection). Presence
of CD transgene within the tumor DNA
confirms the capability of CD-AT-MSC to
deliver the transgene into s.c. induced
tumors after systemic administration; two
tumor samples from two different identically
treated animals were shown. Transduced
CD-Fib failed to deliver the transgene into
tumors. DNA isolated from cultured
CD-AT-MSC served as a control. DNA
integrity was confirmed by detection of
human Alu sequences. D, quantification of
CD-AT-MSC homing within the tumor mass
was done by real-time quantitative PCR
using SYBR Green dye. Specificity of
amplification was verified by melting
analysis. Standard curve for CD-positive
cells was calculated from samples with
known proportion of CD-AT-MSC cells
mixed with HT-29 cells. CD-AT-MSC were
present in 3 of 3 animals examined at
each time point; however, their proportion
varied from 0.87% to 3.89% at day 9 and
0.23% to 0.55% at day 20.

tumors by days 9 and 20, respectively (Fig. 6D), which translated
into 91% and 68.5% tumor inhibition at given time points.

Discussion
In this pilot study, we present the capability of human MSC
derived from adipose tissue to serve as cellular vehicles for targeted
cancer chemotherapy. CD-AT-MSC were prepared by retrovirus
transduction. High transduction efficiency estimated to be close
to 98% based on the G418 selection1 is advantageous for the
optimal therapeutic application. It eliminates lengthy selection
requirement and/or undesired prolonged AT-MSC expansion
ex vivo. Moreover, transgene-bearing vector was designed as a
replication-deficient retrovirus for safety reasons. Retention of ATMSC properties on gene manipulation ex vivo was investigated to
some extent. Experiments published thus far (13, 19) and our data

did not show any negative effect of retrovirus transduction and
transgene expression on MSC differentiation capabilities, immunophenotype, migration properties, or pluripotency transcription
factor expression.
Yeast fusion CD::UPRT gene chosen for our study was reported to
exhibit improved 5-FC conversion efficiency and higher bystander
effect in vitro and in vivo (9–11). Because there is neither enzyme
nor virus produced from therapeutic cells, our strategy relies on
bystander cytotoxic effect of therapeutic CD-AT-MSC combined
with 5-FC on target cells. Tumor targeted delivery and site-specific
production of 5-FU mediated by CD-expressing cells can exert
strong cytotoxic effect on rapidly proliferating tumor cells (35–37).
In contrast to other stem cell–based approaches, MSC derived from
adipose tissue seem to be intrinsically highly resistant to 5-FU. The
‘‘suicide’’ gene CD::UPRT introduction moderately changed sensitivity CD-AT-MSC to 5-FC and 5-FU; however, they still seem to be
much more resistant compared with untransduced target tumor
cells HT-29. This may spare the cellular vehicle from the ‘‘suicide’’
effect and pronounce further the bystander killing effect by

prolonged production of 5-FU and/or achieving higher local
concentrations herewith increasing the therapeutic efficiency.
AT-MSC sensitivity to 5-FU increased with number of passages,
suggesting gradual loss of resistance during forced proliferation
ex vivo.1 We hypothesize that potential uncontrolled CD-AT-MSC
proliferation would be eliminated by suicide effect of CD::UPRT
transgene based on these observations. This presents additional
safety feature of therapeutic CD-AT-MSC in vivo. The mechanism
underlying chemoresistance AT-MSC properties was not the
objective of this study, and it remains under further investigations.
However, be it a general property of MSC, it would predetermine
MSC to become valuable vehicles for the delivery of various
‘‘suicide’’ transgenes to target the cells of interest and spare the
vehicle cells by their endogenous resistance mechanism.
Here, we show for the first time the capability of MSC derived
from the adipose tissue to migrate actively toward tumor cells. This
is consistent with the reports describing tumor-directed migratory
abilities of MSC derived from bone marrow (16). Migratory
properties have to be further evaluated for the tumor type
specificity as well as possible signaling molecules to be involved
due to the relevance for potential therapeutic applications. It has
been reported that epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived
growth factor, SCF/c-Kit, stromal cell–derived factor-1/CXCR4,
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor
(VEGFR) 1 and VEGFR2 may play a role in these intrinsic tumorspecific migration capability and interactions (16, 36).
MSC were reported to support s.c. tumor growth in a different
model (18, 38). Coinjection of 50% and 10% AT-MSC+HT-29
mixtures led to initial tumor growth support (Fig. 4B). Supportive
effect was not observed on AT-MSC systemic administration
(Fig. 6B), which is the therapeutic approach more relevant for
future clinical studies. The proportion of CD-AT-MSC in tumors
achieved <4% CD-AT-MSC after single i.v. injection. We hypothesize
that such proportion did not suffice to support tumor growth. In
contrast, combination of targeted CD-AT-MSC homing into tumor
with inherent CD-AT-MSC resistance to ‘‘suicide’’ effect pronounced neighboring killing effect still to achieve significant tumor
growth inhibition in vivo.
Systemic administration of MSC was extensively evaluated in
terms of organ distribution and possible unwanted adverse effect
of MSC accumulation (19, 23). To this end, all studies published
thus far and our experiments showed no accumulation in other
organs and no other side effects were observed thus far.

None of the animals remained tumor-free or cured in our
experimental setting. It is generally acknowledged that the
successful long-term effective therapy or curative approach would
require combination of more treatment strategies. In our approach,
the 5-FU produced at the site of tumor formation is expected to
eliminate rapidly proliferating tumor cell population based on its
mechanism of action (4). However, quiescent and nondividing
tumor cells present within the tumor mass might withstand the
toxicity. Our future studies will be directed toward optimized
protocols for dosage and timing of the therapy to achieve
maximum tumor growth suppression. We also intend to design
combination strategy of targeting nondividing quiescent cells
within the tumor mass. It is obvious from the recent data that
those cells may in fact be responsible for the recurrence of the
disease and metastasis outgrowth and they certainly are the targets
for the long-term effective cancer therapy (39, 40).
Taken together, here, we present human MSC derived from
adipose tissue as cell-based delivery vehicles for the site-specific
enzyme prodrug conversion approach to targeted chemotherapy.
Engineered CD-AT-MSC expressing yeast fusion CD::UPRT gene
combined with 5-FC were efficient in suppression of s.c. human
colon cancer xenograft growth in our pilot study in vivo. MSC from
adipose tissue are easily obtainable with no ethical concerns about
the stem cell source, rapidly expandable to desired amount, and can
be gene manipulated ex vivo. AT-MSC possess specific chemoresistance and migration properties and therefore should be
considered valuable adult stem cell types for autologous use in
cancer therapy. It is worth to test AT-MSC further as cellular vehicles
for other prodrug converting gene systems in treatment of various
tumor types. This would open new ways to AT-MSC exploitation for
personalized cell-based therapeutic approaches in future.
