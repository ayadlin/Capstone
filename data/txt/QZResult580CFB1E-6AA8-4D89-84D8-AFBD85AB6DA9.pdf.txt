Abstract
Estrogen receptor a (ER)–positive breast cancers adapt to hormone deprivation and become resistant to
antiestrogens. In this study, we sought to identify kinases essential for growth of ERþ breast cancer cells resistant
to long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED). A kinome-wide siRNA screen showed that the insulin receptor (InsR) is
required for growth of MCF-7/LTED cells. Knockdown of InsR and/or insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGFIR) inhibited growth of 3 of 4 LTED cell lines. Inhibition of InsR and IGF-IR with the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor
OSI-906 prevented the emergence of hormone-independent cells and tumors in vivo, inhibited parental and LTED
cell growth and PI3K/AKT signaling, and suppressed growth of established MCF-7 xenografts in ovariectomized
mice, whereas treatment with the neutralizing IGF-IR monoclonal antibody MAB391 was ineffective. Combined
treatment with OSI-906 and the ER downregulator fulvestrant more effectively suppressed hormone-independent
tumor growth than either drug alone. Finally, an insulin/IGF-I gene expression signature predicted recurrencefree survival in patients with ERþ breast cancer treated with the antiestrogen tamoxifen. We conclude that
therapeutic targeting of both InsR and IGF-IR should be more effective than targeting IGF-IR alone in abrogating
resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6773–84. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Increasing evidence points to a role for insulin, insulin-like
growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF-II in cancer development and
progression (1, 2). The mitogenic actions of insulin are mediated by the insulin receptor (InsR) tyrosine kinase (2). Activated InsR phosphorylates InsR substrates (IRS-1 to -4), which
bind the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). In
turn, PI3K activates downstream effectors including AKT. InsR
heterodimerizes with the highly homologous IGF-I receptor
(IGF-IR), which also binds IGF-I and IGF-II (2).
Overexpression of InsR and IGF-IR has been detected in
human breast cancers (3–5), and overexpression of either
receptor is tumorigenic in mouse tumor models (6). PhosphorAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Medicine, 2Cancer Biology,

ylated InsR/IGF-IR is present in all breast cancer subtypes, and
high levels have been correlated with poor survival (7). IGF-IR
has been pursued as a therapeutic target in cancer (8), but InsR
has received less attention because of the potential for dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. Studies have implicated InsR
in transformation and breast cancer mitogenesis, and hyperinsulinemia can accelerate mammary tumor progression in a
mouse model of type II diabetes (9). Furthermore, type II
diabetes and hyperinsulinemia are associated with increased
breast cancer risk, and use of an inhaled form of insulin in
patients with type I diabetes has been linked with breast cancer
development (1).
Two-thirds of breast cancers express estrogen receptor a
(ER) and/or progesterone receptor, biomarkers indicative of
hormone dependence (10). Therapies for ERþ breast cancer
inhibit ER function by antagonizing ligand binding to ER
(tamoxifen), downregulating ER (fulvestrant), or blocking
estrogen biosynthesis [aromatase inhibitors (AI)]. However,
many tumors exhibit de novo or acquired resistance to antiestrogens. One mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy
for which clinical data exist is overexpression of the ErbB2/
HER2 protooncogene (11, 12). However, because less than 10%
of ERþ breast cancers express high HER2 levels, mechanisms
of escape from endocrine therapy remain to be discovered for
most ERþ breast cancers. Using RNA interference (RNAi)
screening and pharmacologic inhibitors of InsR and IGF-IR,
we discovered InsR and IGF-IR are required for hormoneindependent breast cancer cell growth, thus providing a

the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (VU-VICC-IRB080064, NCT00651976). Tumor lysates were analyzed by
reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA; refs. 13, 17, 18).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Parental lines (ATCC) were maintained in improved minimum essential medium/10% FBS (Gibco) and authenticated by
short tandem repeat proﬁling using Sanger sequencing (March
2011). Long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED) cells were
generated in (13) and maintained in phenol red–free IMEM
with 10% dextran/charcoal-treated FBS (DCC-FBS).
siRNA screen
MCF-7/LTED cells were transfected with the Dharmacon
RTF Protein Kinase siRNA library (14) as in Supplementary
Methods.
Cell proliferation
Cells in DCC-FBS with or without OSI-906 (OSI Pharmaceuticals), MAB391, IGF-I (R&D Systems), or insulin (Gibco) were
counted or ﬁxed/stained with crystal violet (13). For siRNA
experiments, cells were transfected by using HiPerfect (Qiagen)
and then reseeded and treated as earlier.
Immunoblot analysis and receptor tyrosine kinase
arrays
Lysates from cells treated with OSI-906 or AEW541 (Selleck
Chemicals) were subjected to immunoblot analysis (13).
Immunoprecipitations were carried out by using Dynal protein
G beads (Invitrogen), and 4G10 p-Tyr or p85 antibody (Millipore; ref. 15). Phospho–receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) arrays
were carried out by using the Human Phospho-RTK Array Kit
according to manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems).
Mouse experiments
Mouse experiments were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female ovariectomized athymic mice were implanted with a 14-day release 17bestradiol (E2) pellet (0.17 mg) and 107 MCF-7 cells. After more
than 2 weeks, mice without palpable tumors (prevention
experiment), or mice bearing tumors of 150 mm3 or more
(treatment experiment) were randomized to vehicle (25 mmol/
L tartaric acid), OSI-906 (50 mg/kg/day, per os), MAB391 (1 mg
every 3 days, intraperitoneally), or fulvestrant (5 mg/wk, s.c.).
Tumor volume in mm3 was measured 2 times a week by using
the formula: volume ¼ width2  length/2. Tumors were
harvested and snap-frozen in liquid N2 or ﬁxed in 10% formalin
prior to parafﬁn embedding for immunohistochemistry (IHC).
[18F]FDG-PET
2-deoxy-2-[18F]ﬂuoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) was carried out as described (16).
Reverse-phase protein arrays
Core biopsies were obtained from patients with operable
ERþ/HER2-negative (HER2) breast cancer treated with letrozole (2.5 mg/d) for 10 to 21 days. This study was approved by

Results
RNAi screening implicates InsR in hormoneindependent breast cancer cell growth
We previously established a panel of ERþ breast cancer
cell lines selected after LTED (13). To identify kinases
required for growth of these cells in the absence of hormones, we performed a high-throughput RNAi screen targeting 779 kinases. MCF-7/LTED cells were reverse-transfected with siRNA; cell viability was measured 4 days later
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Median cell growth in 4
independent experiments was calculated for each siRNA.
Individual knockdown of 42 kinases (Supplementary Table
S1) inhibited MCF-7/LTED cell growth 33% or more (P 
0.05) in at least 3 of 4 experiments (Fig. 1A). Proteomic
network analysis revealed that these 42 kinases map to
several protein networks that overlap with InsR signaling,
including PI3K (Supplementary Fig. S3). Knockdown of the
InsR inhibited MCF-7/LTED growth by 35.2% compared with
control siRNA (Fig. 1A). Because the InsR was a central node
in the overlapping protein networks, and hyperactivation of
the InsR/IGF-IR/PI3K/mTOR pathway has been implicated
in acquired hormone-independent breast cancer cell growth
(13), we selected InsR for further characterization.
We next quantiﬁed the expression of 190 total and phosphorylated proteins in surgical specimens from 10 patients
with operable ERþ/HER2 breast cancer that were treated for
10 to 21 days with the AI letrozole prior to surgery (Vanderbilt
clinical trial NCT00651976). Tumor cell proliferation was
assessed by Ki67 IHC in pre- and posttreatment biopsies. Of
note, high Ki67 levels following short-term antiestrogen therapy have been associated with resistance to estrogen deprivation and poor patient outcome (19). By RPPA, the levels of 51
total and phospho-site–speciﬁc proteins correlated with the
posttreatment Ki67 score (r > 0.4; Fig. 1B). Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of these 51
proteins and phosphoproteins revealed that 13 were involved
in insulin signaling (hsa04910) or were immediate effectors of
this pathway (e.g., LKB1, S6; Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S4).
This represented a signiﬁcant enrichment of insulin pathway
members which correlated with the post-AI Ki67 (of the 190
antibodies screened by RPPA, 34 were involved in insulin
signaling by KEGG; 1-sided x2 test P ¼ 0.049), further suggesting that InsR signaling is associated with adaptation of estrogen deprivation in human tumors.

Insulin/IGF-I Receptors and Antiestrogen Resistance

Knockdown of InsR and IGF-IR inhibits hormoneindependent growth and PI3K/AKT
Knockdown of InsR with an independent siRNA signiﬁcantly
inhibited growth of 3 of 4 LTED lines (Fig. 2A). Because InsR
heterodimerizes with IGF-IR to activate PI3K, and RTK arrays
revealed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR and/or
InsR in 3 of 4 LTED lines (13), we also knocked down the IGF-IR.
Knockdown of IGF-IR alone or in combination with InsR also
inhibited growth of 3 of 4 LTED lines. However, the HER2ampliﬁed MDA-361/LTED cell line was resistant to knockdown
of both receptors (Fig 2A). Receptor knockdown was conﬁrmed
by immunoblot (Supplementary Fig. S5). Knockdown of InsR or
IGF-IR resulted in a compensatory upregulation of the other
receptor (Fig. 2B), suggesting that combined knockdown
would further inhibit signal transduction. Indeed, knockdown
of either receptor reduced P-AKT in MCF-7 and MCF-7/LTED
cells, but dual knockdown had an additive effect (Fig. 2B). In
MCF-7/LTED cells, knockdown of InsR more effectively inhibited P-AKT than IGF-IR knockdown. Dual knockdown
decreased P-AKT and P-S6 in ZR75-1/LTED and HCC-1428/
LTED cells, as well as P-4EBP1 (an mTORC1 substrate) in
ZR75-1/LTED cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that both InsR and
IGF-IR drive PI3K/AKT/TORC1 signaling and hormone-independent growth.

using KEGG pathway analysis. Proteins involved in insulin signaling

InsR/IGF-IR tyrosine kinase inhibitors block hormoneindependent growth and suppress PI3K/AKT
We next examined the effects of the ATP-competitive
dual InsR/IGF-IR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) OSI-906
(6, 20) and AEW541 (21). OSI-906 has shown antitumor
activity against colorectal and non–small cell lung cancer
xenografts (6, 16, 22). Treatment with both small molecules
inhibited insulin- and IGF-I–induced phosphorylation of
InsR, IGF-IR, and AKT (Fig. 3A). An approximate physiologic concentration of insulin in human plasma (60 pmol/L)
did not activate PI3K/AKT in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S6). However, 10 mg/mL of insulin activated PI3K/AKT.
This was blocked by knockdown of InsR but not IGF-IR,
suggesting that, at this concentration, insulin acts mainly
through the InsR. OSI-906 inhibited baseline InsR and IGFIR phosphorylation in LTED cells (Fig. 3B) and reduced PAKT and P-S6 (Fig. 3C). Finally, OSI-906 treatment disrupted the association between p85/PI3K and IRS-1 under
steady-state and ligand-induced conditions (Fig. 3C), further suggesting that blockade of InsR/IGF-IR inhibits PI3K/
AKT/TORC1 signaling.
We then assessed the effects of InsR/IGF-IR inhibition on
growth of hormone-deprived cells. OSI-906 suppressed monolayer growth of 4 of 4 parental and LTED lines (Fig. 3D) and the
anchorage-independent growth of 3 of 4 parental and LTED
lines (Supplementary Fig. S7). Notably, OSI-906 was more
effective in the LTED derivatives of MCF-7 and MDA-361 cells
compared with their parental counterparts (Fig. 3D). To determine whether InsR/IGF-IR are required for the emergence of
hormone-independent cells, parental cells were reselected in
hormone-depleted medium. OSI-906 prevented or delayed the
emergence of hormone-independent MCF-7, ZR75-1, HCC1428, and MDA-361 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8), suggesting

that InsR/IGF-IR signaling is required for adaptation to estrogen deprivation.
Inhibition of both InsR and IGF-IR prevents hormoneindependent growth in vivo
MCF-7 xenografts were established in ovariectomized athymic female mice supplemented with a 14-day release E2 pellet.
Upon expiration of the E2 pellet, the estrogen levels in these
mice should mirror those found in postmenopausal patients
treated with an AI. On day 15, mice without palpable tumors
were randomized to treatment with vehicle or OSI-906. Six of
20 control mice (30%) developed tumors, whereas none of the
20 OSI-906–treated mice did (Fig. 4A).
We next assessed the effects of OSI-906 on established
tumors. Following expiration of the E2 pellet, mice with tumors
measuring 150 mm3 or more were randomized to vehicle or
OSI-906. OSI-906 inhibited tumor growth compared with vehicle (Fig. 4B; P < 0.05). To conﬁrm drug target inhibition, tumors
were harvested after 3 days of treatment. OSI-906–treated
tumors exhibited markedly lower levels of phosphorylated
IGF-IR, InsR, IRS-1, AKT, and S6 compared with vehicle controls (Fig. 4C). We also used [18F]FDG-PET as an indicator of
OSI-906–mediated inhibition of PI3K/AKT (16). After 10 days

6776

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

of therapy, OSI-906 only modestly delayed xenograft growth
(Supplementary Fig. S9). However, FDG uptake was signiﬁcantly decreased 4 hours after a single dose of OSI-906 compared with baseline (Fig. 4D), suggestive of inactivation
of PI3K/AKT in vivo. These data suggest that inhibition of
InsR/IGF-IR with OSI-906 prevents the emergence of hormoneindependent tumors and inhibits growth of established xenografts at least in part by inhibiting PI3K/AKT.
Blockade of InsR and IGF-IR is required to inhibit PI3K/
AKT and prevent emergence of hormone-independent
cells
We next asked whether the relevant therapeutic target of
OSI-906 in LTED cells is the InsR, IGF-IR, or both. MAB391 is an
IGF-IR–speciﬁc monoclonal antibody that binds the ectodomain of IGF-IR and downregulates IGF-IR homodimers and
IGF-IR/InsR heterodimers (8). MAB391 downregulated IGF-IR
expression in MCF-7/LTED cells without affecting InsR levels
(Fig. 5A). OSI-906 had no effect on receptor levels but blocked
ligand-induced phosphorylation of InsR, IGF-IR, and AKT. In
contrast, MAB391 blocked IGF-I–induced activation of IGF-IR,
modestly decreased IGF-I–induced P-AKT, but had little effect
on insulin action. OSI-906 was more effective than MAB391 at

blocking IGF-I–induced P-AKT (Fig. 5A), as well as basal P-AKT
and P-S6 levels (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that in LTED cells,
InsR can maintain PI3K signaling in the absence of IGF-IR.
Treatment with OSI-906 but not MAB391 prevented or
delayed the emergence of hormone-independent MCF-7,
ZR75-1, HCC-1428, and MDA-361 cells following estrogen
deprivation (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S8). Furthermore,
OSI-906 treatment prevented the ability of insulin and IGF-I
to rescue MCF-7 cells from estrogen deprivation, whereas
MAB391 prevented rescue only by IGF-I but not by insulin
(Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S10). Notably, OSI-906 prevented rescue by IGF-I better than MAB391 (Fig. 5D), even

though both drugs completely blocked IGF-IR phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that blockade of InsR
and IGF-IR is required to prevent resistance to estrogen
deprivation, and that inhibition of IGF-IR alone is
insufﬁcient.
Dual InsR/IGF-IR blockade inhibits hormoneindependent tumor growth
We next compared the antitumor activity in vivo of OSI-906

vehicle (Fig. 6A; P < 0.05). Conversely, MAB391 had no effect
even though it markedly downregulated tumor IGF-IR levels
(Fig. 6B; Supplementary Fig. S11). The drug combination did
not further suppress tumor growth compared with OSI-906
alone (Fig. 6A). OSI-906 but not MAB391 reduced levels of PInsR/IGF-IR as measured by IHC (Fig. 6B; Supplementary
Fig. S11). As shown with other IGF-IR antibodies and TKIs
(23, 24), treatment with MAB391 and OSI-906 resulted in 1.4fold and 50-fold increases in serum insulin levels, respectively (Fig. 6C); C-peptide levels were similarly altered (not
shown). The antibody used for IHC detects both phosphorylated InsR and IGF-IR, thus implying that tumor cells
maintain InsR activation when treated with an IGF-IR
antibody. This suggests blockade of IGF-IR alone is insufﬁcient to suppress hormone-independent tumor growth.
Although we did not assess serum glucose levels, we should
note that transient and reversible hyperglycemia has been
observed in mice treated with OSI-906 (25).

Treatment with the ER downregulator fulvestrant has been
shown to inhibit growth of MCF-7 cells and xenografts under
estrogen-depleted conditions (26, 27). Others have shown that
IGF-IR cross-talks with ER (28, 29), and fulvestrant reduces
IGF-IR and IRS-2 expression in MCF-7 cells in estrogen-free
conditions (30). Furthermore, therapeutic inhibition of InsR/
IGF-IR in patients with endocrine-resistant breast cancer will
likely be tested in combination with antiestrogens. Thus, we
evaluated the combination of OSI-906 and fulvestrant on
estrogen-independent MCF-7 xenograft growth. Ovariectomized mice with established tumors were randomized to
vehicle, OSI-906, fulvestrant, or the combination. Both single
agents inhibited tumor growth compared with vehicle (P <
0.05; Fig. 6D). The drug combination was superior to the singleagent treatments, inducing a complete tumor regression in 1 of
9 (11%) mice. This result suggests the simultaneous inhibition
of ER and InsR/IGF-IR is more effective in vivo against estrogen-deprived breast tumors.

Insulin/IGF-I–induced gene expression correlates with
response to endocrine therapy
Herein, we carried out gene expression analysis to identify
insulin-modulated pathways in ERþ breast cancer. MCF-7 cells
were serum-starved for 24 hours followed by stimulation with
insulin for 4 or 24 hours. RNA was isolated, and gene expression
was analyzed by using microarrays. Notably, the signature
consisting of genes whose expression levels changed after 4
or 24 hours of insulin treatment (P < 0.001) was inversely

associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) in 2 cohorts of
patients with ERþ breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years (MDACC298, n ¼ 298, P ¼ 0.019; LOI164, n ¼
164, P ¼ 0.074; Fig. 7A; refs. 31, 32). These data suggest that
insulin-induced gene expression patterns are associated with
poor patient outcome after antiestrogen therapy.
Because InsR and IGF-IR elicit both overlapping and distinct
cellular processes (2), we compared insulin-stimulated gene
expression to the IGF-I–stimulated gene expression patterns

reported by Creighton and colleagues, where MCF-7 cells were
treated with IGF-I for 3 or 24 hours (33). Common intrinsic
pathways and gene sets (i.e., "metagenes") are coordinately
modulated and tend to show better reproducibility and consistency than individual genes (34, 35). Therefore, we carried
out gene set analysis (GSA; ref. 36) on each data set followed by
hierarchical clustering of the gene set scores instead of individual genes to identify concordant/discordant transcriptional
processes. Similar to ﬁndings reported by Loboda and collea-

6780

gues (37), we observed that insulin and IGF-I altered common
gene sets following short-term treatment. In contrast, more
distinct patterns were apparent after 24 hours (Fig. 7B; Supplementary Fig. S12). Several gene sets enriched after 24 hours
of IGF-I comprised cell-cycle–related pathways. In contrast, 24
hours of insulin enriched for gene sets comprising cell metabolism, glycolysis, and pentose-phosphate pathway shunting.
These data imply that IGF-IR and InsR elicit both common and
distinct transcriptional outputs.

Finally, we examined whether a common signature of genes
regulated by both ligands was predictive of patient outcome. Similar processing of the published IGF-I data of
Creighton and colleagues (33) identiﬁed a common set of
155 genes altered by both ligands after short- or long-term
treatment. The insulin/IGF-I gene signature correlated
inversely with RFS in both cohorts of tamoxifen-treated patients (MDACC298 P ¼ 0.0004; LOI164 P ¼ 0.033; Fig. 7C).
Notably, the insulin/IGF-I gene signature was more predictive
of RFS than the insulin signature in both data sets, consistent
with the notion that hyperactivation of both receptors generates resistance to endocrine therapy and further implying
that both InsR and IGF-IR should be inhibited for reversal or
attenuation of such resistance.

Discussion
Using a kinome-wide siRNA screen, we identiﬁed the
InsR/IGF-IR pathway as a mechanism of escape from hormone dependence in ERþ breast cancer. RNAi-mediated
knockdown of InsR and/or IGF-IR inhibited growth of ERþ
breast cancer cells adapted to hormone deprivation, but
dual knockdown additively suppressed PI3K/AKT signaling.
Pharmacologic blockade of InsR/IGF-IR with OSI-906 inhibited PI3K/AKT and LTED cell growth. OSI-906 also prevented the emergence of hormone-independent tumors, and
suppressed growth of ERþ xenografts in ovariectomized
mice. Blockade of IGF-IR alone was insufﬁcient to prevent
emergence of hormone-independent cells or suppress tumor
growth, suggesting that dual inhibition of InsR and IGF-IR is
necessary to prevent escape of ERþ breast cancer cells from
estrogen dependence. Combined inhibition of ER and InsR/
IGF-IR suppressed hormone-independent tumor growth
more effectively than each intervention alone. Finally, an
insulin/IGF-I–induced gene expression signature was predictive of RFS in patients with ERþ breast cancer treated
with adjuvant tamoxifen.
Although the IGF-IR has been implicated in tamoxifen
resistance (7, 29, 38, 39), we show herein the importance of
InsR in acquired resistance to endocrine therapy, as a dual
inhibitor of InsR/IGF-IR was clearly superior at abrogating
hormone independence compared with a neutralizing IGF-IR
antibody. There is evidence of hyperactivation of the InsR/IGFIR/PI3K/mTOR pathway in LTED cells (13), which is likely to be
causally associated with resistance to estrogen deprivation.
Both InsR and IGF-IR knockdown inhibited hormone-independent growth (Fig. 2A), suggesting that both receptors are
important in endocrine-resistant cells. Of note, IGF-IR was
not a hit in the siRNA screen; however, false negatives are
unavoidable in screens of this nature. IGF-IR knockdown using
an independent siRNA suppressed hormone-independent
growth (Fig. 2A). Although dual knockdown additively suppressed PI3K/AKT, InsR knockdown inhibited MCF-7/LTED
growth more effectively than dual InsR/IGF-IR knockdown,
but this difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 2A
and B). We speculate that the increased effect of InsR knockdown may be due to downregulation of both InsR homodimers
and InsR/IGF-IR heterodimers.

6782

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

The InsR/IGF-IR TKI OSI-906 is in early clinical trials, where
it has been well tolerated (40–42). Consistent with observations of hyperglycemia in patients treated with other IGF-IR
inhibitors (8, 23), hyperglycemia was reported in a fraction of
patients treated with OSI-906 in phase I trials (41, 42). However,
this side effect did not limit establishment of a maximum
tolerated dose, based on dosing schedules corresponding to
drug exposures predicted to inhibit IGF-IR and InsR in tissue
and peripheral blood. Treatment with OSI-906 was superior
to the IGF-IR antibody MAB391 at inhibiting PI3K/AKT
(Fig. 5A and B). Furthermore, OSI-906 prevented the emergence of hormone-independent cells and tumors (Figs. 4A
and 5C), and suppressed hormone-independent tumor growth
(Fig. 6A). These results imply that blockade of IGF-IR alone
is insufﬁcient to prevent or treat endocrine-resistant breast
cancer, and that both receptors should be targeted in this
clinical setting. In agreement with these data, a recent report
showed that OSI-906 was superior to MAB391 against human
colon cancer xenografts (6). Additionally, dual inhibition of
InsR/IGF-IR was required to inhibit growth in IGF-II–driven
cancers in a transgenic mouse model (43).
The requirement of targeting both InsR and IGF-IR to
suppress estrogen-independent tumor growth may help
explain the outcome of a recent clinical trial. Patients with
ERþ metastatic breast cancer who progressed on prior endocrine therapy were randomized to the AI letrozole with or
without the IGF-IR monoclonal antibody AMG-479. AMG-479
did not add to the clinical effect of letrozole alone (44).
Although insulin levels were not reported in the AMG-479
study, we speculate that a compensatory upregulation of
insulin (Fig. 6C; ref. 23) and, in turn, InsR activation may have
negated a clinical effect of the antibody.
Other studies have shown that ampliﬁed InsR signaling
conveys intrinsic resistance to IGF-IR inhibitors (43, 45).
InsR and IGF-IR cross-talk bidirectionally, suggesting that
InsR can compensate for loss of IGF-IR (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, IGF-IR downregulation sensitizes breast cancer cells
to insulin action (46), MAB391 treatment results in a compensatory increase in InsR phosphorylation (6), and IGF-IR
knockout can sensitize cells to insulin-mediated activation
of InsR, AKT, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (47).
These data further suggest a dual InsR/IGF-IR inhibitor such
as OSI-906 would be a better strategy at inhibiting this
receptor network. The relative contribution of InsR and
IGF-IR homo- versus heterodimers to breast cancer cell
growth is unclear. IGF-I and IGF-II bind heterodimers and
IGF-IR homodimers with high afﬁnity, whereas insulin binds
InsR homodimers but not IGF-IR homodimers or heterodimers at physiologic concentrations (5). Because OSI-906
blocked insulin- and IGF-I–induced PI3K/AKT activation
and cell growth (Fig. 5A and D), we speculate that OSI906 likely inhibits both InsR and IGF-IR heterodimers and
homodimers. Furthermore, insulin and IGF-I altered both
common and distinct gene expression signatures, reinforcing distinct functionality of these 2 pathways (Fig. 7B). We
speculate that genes commonly deregulated by short-term
insulin and IGF-I stimulation may drive resistance to endocrine therapy, because the insulin/IGF-I gene signature was

more predictive than the insulin signature of disease recurrence (Fig. 7A and C). Collectively, these data suggest that
homo- and heterodimers may promote endocrine resistance,
and targeting both receptors is required for effective suppression of the InsR/IGF-IR pathway.
In summary, we have identiﬁed the InsR/IGF-IR pathway
as a mechanism of escape from hormone dependence in ERþ
breast cancer. Because inhibition of InsR and IGF-IR prevented the emergence of hormone-independent tumors, we
propose early intervention with combined ER and InsR/IGFIR–directed therapies in high-risk patients with ERþ breast
cancer may prevent disease recurrence. Furthermore, this
study suggests that targeting InsR/IGF-IR may be more
effective than targeting IGF-IR alone. As a result, dual TKIs
of InsR/IGF-IR should be more effective than neutralizing
IGF-IR antibodies in preventing escape of ERþ breast cancer
from hormone dependence.
