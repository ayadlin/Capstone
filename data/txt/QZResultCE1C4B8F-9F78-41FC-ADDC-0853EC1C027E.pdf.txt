Abstract
Author Manuscript

Neoplastic pancreatic epithelial cells are widely believed to die via Caspase 8-dependant apoptotic
1
cell death and chemotherapy is thought to further promote tumor apoptosis . Conversely,
2,3
disruption of apoptosis is a basic modality cancer cells exploit for survival . However, the role of
necroptosis, or programmed necrosis, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is uncertain.
There are a multitude of potential inducers of necroptosis in PDA including ligation of TNFR1,
45
CD95, TRAIL receptors, Toll-like receptors, ROS, and Chemotherapeutics , . Here we report that
the principal components of the necrosome, RIP1 and RIP3, are highly expressed in PDA and are
further upregulated by chemotherapy. Blockade of the necrosome in vitro promoted cancer cell
proliferation and induced an aggressive oncogenic phenotype. By contrast, in vivo RIP3 deletion
or RIP1 inhibition was protective against oncogenic progression and was associated with the

development of a highly immunogenic myeloid and T cell infiltrate. The immune-suppressive
tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with intact RIP1/RIP3 signaling was in-part
contingent on necroptosis-induced CXCL1 expression whereas CXCL1 blockade was protective
against PDA. Moreover, we found that cytoplasmic SAP130 was expressed in PDA in a RIP1/
RIP3-dependent manner, and Mincle – its cognate receptor – was upregulated in tumor-infiltrating
myeloid cells. Mincle ligation by SAP130 promoted oncogenesis whereas Mincle deletion was
protective and phenocopied the immunogenic reprogramming of the TME characteristic of RIP3
deletion. Cellular depletion experiments suggested that whereas inhibitory macrophages promote
tumorigenesis in PDA, they lose their immune-suppressive effects in the context of RIP3 or
Mincle deletion. As such, T cells which are dispensable to PDA progression in hosts with intact
RIP3 or Mincle signaling become reprogrammed into indispensable mediators of anti-tumor
immunity in absence of RIP3 or Mincle. Our work describes parallel networks of necroptosisinduced CXCL1 and Mincle signaling which critically promote macrophage-induced adaptive
immune suppression enabling PDA progression.

We found that RIP1 and RIP3 are highly expressed in human PDA (Fig. 1a, b). Western
blotting confirmed higher RIP1 and RIP3 expression in human PDA compared with
surrounding normal pancreas (Fig. 1c). Similarly, FADD, which complexes with RIP1/RIP3
to form the necrosome, MLKL, a downstream mediator of necroptosis, and Caspase 8, a
5
principal driver of apoptosis, were upregulated in PDA (Fig. 1c) . Immune fluorescence
microscopy showed evidence of RIP1–RIP3 co-localization in human (Fig. 1d) and murine
(Fig. 1e) PDA suggesting necrosome complex formation. To test whether the necrosome was
inducible with chemotherapy, we treated PDA-bearing mice with Gemcitabine.
Chemotherapeutics increased PDA expression of RIP1 and RIP3 in vivo (Fig. 1f, g).
Similarly, Gemcitabine increased RIP1 and RIP3 expression and RIP1–RIP3 co-association
in vitro in PDA cells (Fig. 1h, i). Expression of components of the necrosome were also
inducible by chemotherapeutics in human PDA cells whereas MLKL inhibition prevented
chemotherapy-induced cell death (Fig. 1j, k).

Since necroptosis is a pro-inflammatory process, we postulated that it would support peri6
tumoral inflammation . We found that CXCL1 is one of the most highly expressed
chemokines in murine PDA (Fig. 2a). Similarly, CXCL1 was robustly expressed in human
PDA (Fig. 2b–d). Gemcitabine upregulated PDA expression of CXCL1 in mice (Fig. 2e),
whereas RIP3 deletion mitigated CXCL1 expression in vivo (Fig. 2f, g) and in vitro (Fig.
2h). High RIP3 also correlated with higher CXCL1 in a human PDA RNAseq database (Fig.
2i). Further, upregulation of CXCL1 by Gemcitabine was mitigated by RIP3 deletion in vivo
(Fig. 2j) and by RIP1 or RIP3 inhibition in vitro (Fig. 2k). Collectively, these data suggest
necrosome-dependent upregulation of CXCL1 in PDA.
We studied the effects of RIP3 deletion on the properties of in vitro cultured KrasG12Dtransformed pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (KrasG12D PDEC). Predictably, RIP3 deletion

increased the proliferative rate of KrasG12D PDEC in vitro (Extended-Data-Fig. 1a).
Moreover, KrasG12D;RIP3−/− PDEC exhibited a distinct phenotype including loss of CDK4
and elevated expression of Bcl-xL and c-Myc (Extended-Data-Fig 1b) which have
7 11
selectively been associated with aggressive tumor-biology in PDA – .

Author Manuscript

Since RIP3 deletion increased proliferation of PDA cells, we postulated that blockade of
necroptosis in vivo would accelerate tumorigenesis. To test this, we compared the rate of
oncogenic progression in p48Cre;KrasG12D(KC);RIP3+/+ versus KC;RIP3−/− pancreata.
Contrary to our hypothesis and belying our in vitro findings, RIP3 deletion was protective.
KC;RIP3−/− pancreata exhibited a diminished rate of acinar replacement by dysplastic ducts,
slower PanIN progression, and reduced fibro-inflammatory changes compared with
KC;RIP3+/+ (Fig. 3a and Extended-Data-Fig. 1c). Accordingly, aged-matched KC;RIP3−/−
pancreata weighed less than controls and RIP3 deletion extended survival (Fig. 3b, c). The
proliferative rate was similar in KC;RIP3+/+ and KC;RIP3−/− pancreatic epithelial cells in
vivo (Fig. 3d). To test whether abrogation of RIP1 signaling similarly protected against
PDA, we treated 6 week-old KC mice for 8 weeks with Nec-1s. RIP1 blockade protected
against oncogenic progression based on pancreas weight and histology (Fig. 3e, f).

Since necroptosis can modulates inflammation , we postulated that RIP3 deletion offers
tumor-protection by enhancing peri-tumoral immunogenicity. RIP3 deletion diminished
infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs; Extended-Data-Fig. 2a). Conversely,
the fraction of T cells and B cells were increased in KC;RIP3−/− pancreata (Extended-DataFig. 2b, c). Analysis of the myeloid compartment showed a decreased fraction of MDSC and
DC in KC;RIP3−/− pancreata (Extended-Data-Fig. 2d, e). Further, consistent with our
immunohistochemical data, bulk tumor-infiltrating TAMs and their M2-like Arg1+CD206+
subset were diminished in the context of RIP3 deletion (Extended-Data-Fig. 2f–h).
Macrophage expression of PD-L1 was also reduced by RIP3 deletion (not shown).
Collectively, these data suggest that RIP3 deletion increases lymphocyte infiltration in PDA
and reduces infiltration of immune-suppressive myeloid cellular subsets. Similarly, in human
PDA high RIP1/RIP3 co-expression correlated with elevated expression of the myeloid cell
marker CD11b (Extended-Data-Fig. 2i).
To determine whether deletion of RIP3 in the epithelial compartment alone is sufficient to
protect against oncogenesis, we challenged cohorts of WT mice with an orthotopic injection
of either KrasG12D;RIP3+/+ PDEC or KrasG12D;RIP3−/− PDEC. Similar to our findings using
pan-RIP3 deletion, KrasG12D;RIP3−/− tumors grew at slower rates than KrasG12D;RIP3+/+
(Fig. 4a) suggesting that RIP3 blockade in the epithelial compartment alone protects against
PDA progression.

Since inflammatory cells within the PDA TME express the components of the necrosome
(Figs. 1a and 4b, c), we investigated whether RIP3 deletion in the extra-epithelial
compartment would similarly mitigate PDA progression. WT and RIP3−/− mice were
challenged with an orthotopic intra-pancreatic injection of KrasG12D PDEC or
Pdx1Cre;KrasG12D;Tp53R172H (KPC)-derived PDA cells, which express both mutant Kras
and p53, and tumor size was measured at 3 weeks. RIP3−/− mice developed smaller

KrasG12D (not shown) and KPC-derived tumors (Fig. 4d) implying that blockade of
necroptosis in the extra-epithelial compartment alone is protective against PDA.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether deletion of RIP3 in the extra-epithelial compartment similarly bolsters
peri-tumoral immunogenicity, we analyzed the inflammatory infiltrate in orthotopic KPC
tumors in WT and RIP3−/− hosts. RIP3 deletion resulted in elevated T cell and B cell
infiltrates (Fig. 4e, f) and peri-tumoral T cells expressed lower IL-10 and PD-1, higher
CD44, and exhibited a lower fraction of Tregs compared with control (Fig. 4g, h; ExtendedData-Fig. 3a–d). Analysis of the myeloid compartment again revealed a reduction in the
fraction of peri-tumoral MDSC (Fig. 4i) and TAMs (Fig. 4j) with a shift toward an M1-like
phenotype (Fig. 4k, l) and reduced PD-L1 expression (Fig. 4m). These data ostensibly
contrast with a recent report which found that RIP1 signaling can enhance CD8+ T cell
cross-priming. However, effects in PDA may be unique to the immunologic milieu of the
13
pancreatic TME . Accordingly, RIP3 deletion was not protective against B16 melanoma or
subcutaneously-implanted KPC cells (Extended-Data-Fig. 3e, f).

Author Manuscript

Since CXCL1 expression in PDA is contingent on the necrosome (Fig. 2) and we found that
CXCR2 is widely expressed on peri-tumoral leukocytes (Extended-Data-Fig. 4a, b), we
postulated that CXCL1 may be responsible for the pro-tumorigenic immune-suppression
14 15
associated with RIP3 signaling by mobilizing myeloid cells , . To test this hypothesis, we
challenged WT mice with orthotopic PDA whilst blocking CXCL1 in select cohorts.
CXCL1 blockade protected against tumorigenesis in both the orthotopic KrasG12D PDEC
(not shown) and KPC (Extended-Data-Fig. 4c) models. However, αCXCL1 treatment did
not further enhance tumor protection in RIP3−/− animals (Extended-Data-Fig. 4d).
Moreover, similar to RIP3 deletion, CXCL1 blockade reduced MDSC and TAM
accumulation (Extended-Data-Fig. 4e, f). Tumor-infiltrating T cells were also more activated
in the context of CXCL1 blockade as evidenced by higher CD44 and TNFα expression
(Extended-Data Fig. 4g, h). However, CXCL1 inhibition was not significantly associated
with higher infiltration of peri-tumoral T cells (Extended-Data-Fig. 4i), nor did it diminish
Treg accumulation or lower IL-10 expression (not shown), each characteristic of RIP3
deletion. Taken together, these data suggest that CXCL1 overexpression alone may not
account for the entire immune-suppressive phenotype associated with intact necroptosis
signaling in PDA.

Author Manuscript

We postulated that necroptotic tumor cells release soluble factors which induce peri-tumoral
immune-suppression. Mincle, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) critical in mycobacterial
immunity, can promote sterile inflammation in vitro by ligating SAP130, a nuclear protein
16 17
released from dying cells , . We discovered high cytoplasmic SAP130 expression in
human PDA (Extended-Data-Fig. 5a). SAP130 expression was also upregulated by
chemotherapeutics in human PDA cell lines (Extended-Data-Fig. 5b). Further, SAP130 was
highly expressed in KC;RIP3+/+ pancreata whereas its expression was reduced in
KC;RIP3−/− (Extended-Data-Fig. 5c). Similarly, Gemcitabine-induced upregulation of
Sap130 was partially mitigated by Nec-1s (Extended-Data-Fig. 5d). SAP130 expression in
PDA was evident in both epithelial and inflammatory cells (Extended-Data-Fig. 5e, f).
Moreover, confocal microscopy suggested SAP130 co-localization with RIP1/RIP3 in
human (Extended-Data-Fig. 5g) and murine (not shown) PDA. SAP130 similarly correlated

with high RIP1/RIP3 coexpression in a human RNAseq database (Extended-Data-Fig. 5h).
Notably, there was a trend toward an association between high SAP130 expression and
diminished survival in human PDA (Extended-Data-Fig. 5i).

Author Manuscript

We postulated that Mincle ligation by SAP130 drives necrosome-induced accelerated
oncogenesis. Accordingly, immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that Mincle coassociates with SAP130 in PDA (Extended-Data-Fig. 5j). Mincle was expressed in
inflammatory cells in the human PDA TME, but absent in transformed ductal cells and in
normal pancreas (Extended-Data-Fig. 6a). Overall, ~10% of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes
expressed Mincle in human PDA compared with minimal expression in PBMC (ExtendedData-Fig. 6b). Subset analysis revealed high Mincle expression in human CD14+CD15+
tumor-infiltrating monocytes compared with lower expression in their counterparts in PBMC
(Extended-Data-Fig. 6c). Similarly, in KC mice 10–15% of pancreatic leukocytes expressed
Mincle compared with low expression in the spleen or in parenchymal cells (Extended-DataFig. 6d). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed Mincle expression in enriched PDAinfiltrating leukocytes (Extended-Data-Fig. 6e). Subset analysis suggested that Mincle was
highly expressed in PDA-infiltrating MDSC, DC, and macrophages compared with lower
expression in spleen (Extended-Data-Fig. 6f). Western blotting showed elevated expression
of Mincle-related signaling intermediates in PDA in a RIP3-dependant manner (ExtendedData-Fig. 6g). Accordingly, p-Syk+ leukocytes were comparatively scarce in KC;RIP3−/−
and KC;Mincle−/− pancreata (Extended-Data-Fig. 6h). However, Mincle deletion in PDA did
not mitigate CXCL1 expression (Extended-Data-Fig. 6i) and CXCL1 blockade did not alter
expression of Mincle-associated signaling intermediates (not shown).

To determine whether Mincle signaling accelerates oncogenesis, we serially treated 6 weekold KC mice with the Mincle ligand TDB, which we confirmed induced Syk
phosphorylation in vivo (Extended-Data-Fig. 7a). Mincle ligation accelerated tumorigenesis
resulting in higher grade PanIN lesions, extensive fibrosis, and scattered foci of invasion
(Extended-Data-Fig. 7b). TDB also accelerated the growth-rate of orthotopically implanted
KPC-derived tumors in WT (not shown) and RIP3−/− animals (Extended-Data-Fig. 7c),
suggesting that the pro-tumorigenic effects of Mincle activation in PDA are either
independent or downstream of RIP3 signaling. Moreover, the inflammatory TME in TDBtreated RIP3−/− pancreata recapitulated the immune-suppressive milieu associated with an
intact necroptosis signaling mechanism. Specifically, TDB-treated pancreata trended toward
a lower fraction of tumor-infiltrating T cells (Extended-Data-Fig. 7d) and exhibited
increased recruitment of both MDSC (Extended-Data-Fig. 7e) and M2-like TAMs which
expressed high PD-L1 (Extended-Data-Fig. 7f–i). Similarly, direct inoculation of orthotopic
PDA tumors with recombinant SAP130 accelerated PDA growth in WT and RIP3−/− hosts
but not in Mincle−/− animals (Extended-Data-Fig. 7j) and recruited an immune-suppressive
infiltrate (Extended-Data-Fig. 7k, l).
To determine whether Mincle signaling is required for PDA progression, we crossed
Mincle−/− with KC mice and interrogated pancreata at serial intervals. Mincle deletion
slowed the rate of oncogenesis based on histological analysis, pancreas weight, and animal
survival (Extended-Data-Fig. 8a–c). Similarly, orthotopic KPC-derived tumor implantation
in Mincle−/− pancreata resulted in smaller tumors and prolonged survival compared with

implantation in WT hosts (Extended-Data-Fig. 8d, e). However, the survival benefit afforded
to Mincle−/− mice was not as pronounced as RIP3−/−. Moreover, KrasG12D PDEC
orthotropic implantation experiments suggested that CXCL1+Mincle blockade had additive
protective effects whereas combined blockade of RIP3+Mincle or RIP3+CXCL1 did not
confer additional protection over RIP3 blockade alone (Extended-Data-Fig. 8f).

Author Manuscript

To determine whether Mincle deletion mimics the immunogenic reprogramming of the TME
associated with RIP3 deletion, we assayed the pancreatic infiltrate in KC;Mincle−/− mice.
KC;Mincle−/− pancreata exhibited diminished TAM infiltration but increased T cell
recruitment on IHC (Extended-Data-Fig. 9a). Flow cytometry confirmed that Mincle
deletion was associated with a higher immunogenic T cell infiltrate (Extended-Data-Fig. 9b–
d), diminished MDSC infiltration (Extended-Data-Fig. 9e), a trend toward reduced DC
(Extended-Data-Fig. 9f), a decreased fraction of TAMs (Extended-Data-Fig. 9g) with M1like polarization (Extended-Data-Fig. 9h, i) and reduced PD-L1 expression (not shown).
These changes recapitulate the immunogenic reprogramming of the TME characteristic of
RIP3 deletion.

Author Manuscript

To investigate whether tumor-protection in absence of RIP3 or Mincle signaling is T cell
dependent, we depleted T cells coincident with orthotopic KPC tumor administration in
cohorts of WT, RIP3−/−, and Mincle−/− animals. T cell depletion did not influence PDA
growth in WT mice. However, tumor protection was abrogated in RIP3−/− and Mincle−/−
cohorts (Extended-Data-Fig. 10a). Conversely, depletion of macrophages in WT mice led to
T cell activation and tumor protection; however, macrophage-depletion had no effect on
further enhancing T cell activation or tumor protection in RIP3−/− and Mincle−/− animals
(Extended-Data-Fig. 10b, c). These data suggest that in WT hosts TAMs promote PDA
progression whereas T cells are dispensable to outcome; conversely, in absence of RIP3 or
Mincle signaling, macrophages surrender their tumor-promoting effects and T cells are
reprogrammed into indispensable mediators of anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, our work
suggests that necroptosis-induced CXCL1 and Mincle signaling promote myeloid cell
induced adaptive immune suppression in PDA. Each of these networks represent novel
targets for experimental therapeutics (Extended-Data-Fig. 10c).

Methods
Animals and In Vivo Models

Author Manuscript

C57BL/6 (H-2Kb) mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME). Mincle−/−
17
mice were obtained from the MMRRC (San Diego, CA) . RIP3−/− mice were obtained
18
from Genentech (San Francisco, CA) . KC (gift of D. Bar-Sagi) and KPC (gift of Mark
Philips, both New York University) mice develop pancreatic neoplasia endogenously by
expressing mutant Kras alone or mutant Kras and p53, respectively, in the progenitor cells of
19 20
the pancreas , . Both male and female mice were used but animals were gender and age
matched in each experiment. Randomization was not performed. There were no specific
inclusion or exclusion criteria. Sample sizes for experiments were determined without
21
formal power calculations. Survival data for control KC mice were previously reported .
For orthotopic pancreatic tumor challenge, mice were administered intra-pancreatic
injections of either KrasG12D PDEC or FC1242 tumor cells derived from KPC mice.

KrasG12D PDEC and FC1242 cells were generated as previously described , . In
preparation for intra-pancreatic injection, cells were suspended in PBS with 50% Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 1×106 cells/mL and 1×105 cells were injected into
the body of the pancreas via laparotomy. Age-matched mice were used between 8–10 weeks
of age for orthotopic tumor experiments. Mice were sacrificed 3–6 weeks later and tumor
volume recorded. To study the effects of Mincle ligation, mice were administered TDB
(4mg/kg; Invivogen, San Diego, CA) by i.p. injection thrice weekly for 8 weeks in
endogenous tumor models and for 3 weeks in the orthotopic tumor models. In other
experiments, orthotopic tumors were serially treated with direct inoculation of recombinant
SAP130 (22µg; MyBioSource, San Diego, CA) at one week intervals via mini-laparotomy.
In select experiments, cohorts of mice were treated daily with the RIP1 inhibitor Nec-1s
(2mg/kg, i.p.; BioVision, Milpitas, CA) or a neutralizing α-CXCL1 mAb (4mg/kg, i.v.;
R&D Systems). Gemcitabine (100mg/kg, i.p.; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) was administered in
vivo to KPC mice for 3 doses at 72h intervals unless otherwise specified. T cells (T24/31)
and macrophages (F4/80, both BioXcell) were depleted with neutralizing mAbs using
23
regimens we have previously described . In some experiments, mice were subcutaneously
administered FC1242 cells (1×106) or B16 melanoma (1×106; gift of Ronald DeMatteo,
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) and sacrificed at 18 days. Investigators were not
blinded to group allocation but were blinded when assessing outcome. All animal
procedures were approved by the New York University School of Medicine IACUC. The
maximum tumor size permitted is 3cm3 and this was not exceeded.
Cell lines and In Vitro Experiments

Author Manuscript

The human PDA cell lines AsPC1, PANC1, and MIA PaCa-2 cells (gifts of Dafna Bar-Sagi,
originally obtained from ATCC) were maintained in complete RPMI (RPMI 1640 with 10%
heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin). Cell lines were not
authenticated. Cells were free of mycoplasma. In selected experiments, cells were treated
with Gemcitabine (10–50µM), Nec-1s (50µM), a RIP3 inhibitor (GSK872; 6 µM), or a
MLKL inhibitor (Necrosulphonamide, 1µM, both EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cellular
viability was determined by PI staining. Cellular proliferation was assessed using the XTT II
assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche, Pleasanton, CA) and expressed as %
proliferation compared to control. Inflammatory mediators in cell culture supernatant were
measured using the Milliplex Immunoassay (Millipore, Billerica, MA). CXCL1 was
additionally measured using Flexbeads (BD Biosciences) and ELISA (R&D Systems).
Cellular Harvest and Flow Cytometry

Author Manuscript

Human or murine single cell suspensions for flow cytometry were prepared as described
24
previously with slight modifications . Briefly, pancreata were placed in cold RPMI 1640
with 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) and 2 U/mL
DNAse I (Promega, Madison, WI) and minced with scissors to sub-millimeter pieces.
Tissues were then incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes with gentle shaking every 5 minutes.
Specimens were passed through a 100µm mesh, and centrifuged at 350g for 5 minutes. The
cell pellet was resuspended in cold PBS with 1% FBS. After blocking FcγRIII/II with an
anti-CD16/CD32 mAb (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), cell labeling was performed by
incubating 106 cells with 1 µg of fluorescently conjugated mAbs directed against murine

Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

For protein extraction from tissues, 15–30 mg of tissue was homogenized in 150–300µL (i.e.
10 times the weight) ice-cold RIPA buffer. Total protein was quantified using the BioRad
DC Protein Assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
24
Western blotting was performed as previously described with minor modifications . Briefly,
10 % Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (NuPage, Invitrogen) were equiloaded with 10–30µg of
protein, electrophoresed at 200 V, and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes. After
blocking with 5% BSA, membranes were probed with primary antibodies to β-actin

SAP130 was precipitated with protein G-agarose from cells. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended and heated in loading buffer under reduced conditions, and resolved by 10%
SDS-PAGE before transfer to PVDF membranes. The presence of co-immunoprecipitated
RIP3 or Mincle, respectively, were determined by western blotting.
Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and Microscopy

Author Manuscript

For histological analysis, pancreatic specimens were fixed with 10% buffered formalin,
dehydrated in ethanol, embedded with paraffin, and stained with H&E or Gomori’s
24
Trichrome. The fraction of preserved acinar area was calculated as previously described .
25
Pancreatic ductal dysplasia was graded according to established criteria .
Immunohistochemistry in mouse tissues was performed using antibodies directed against
F4/80 (CI:A3-1; Abcam), CD3 (Polyclonal; Abcam), Arg1 (EPR6671(B); Abcam), SAP130

Mincle (AT16E3; Abcam), CXCL1 (Polyclonal; Abcam), and SAP130 (Polyclonal; Abcam).
All human tissues were collected using an IRB approved protocol and donors of deidentified specimens gave informed consent. Sample sizes for human experiments were not
determined based on formal power calculations. Quantifications were performed by
assessing 10 high-power fields (HPF; 40×) per slide in a blinded manner.
Immunofluorescent staining in frozen mouse tissues or cells was performed using antibodies
against Mincle (AT16E3, Acris Antibodies), RIP1 (Polyclonal, Bioss), RIP3 (Polyclonal,
Bioss), CD45 (30-F11; BD Biosciences), CK19 (Clone 13, Abnova), CXCL1 (Polyclonal;
Abcam), CXCR2 (SA045E1; BioLegend), SAP130 (Polyclonal; Abcam), and DAPI (Vector
Labs, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescent images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM700
confocal microscope with ZEN 2010 software (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, New York).
PCR

Author Manuscript

RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) as
per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was converted to cDNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit
(Qiagen). qPCR was performed using the RT2 SYBR Green qPCR mastermix (Qiagen) on
the Stratagene MX3005P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the respective
manufacturers’ protocols. Primers employed for human and mouse samples (RIP1, RIP3,
CASP8, FADD, CXCL1, and SAP130) were purchased from Qiagen. Expression levels were
normalized to β-actin and expressed as fold change compared to control.
Human Database and Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

Human RNAseq data and clinical correlations were performed using the UCSC Cancer
26
Genomics Browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/) . Data is presented as mean +/−
standard error. Survival was measured according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical
significance was determined by the Student’s t test and the log-rank test using GraphPad
Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). P-values <0.05 were considered significant.

were tested for RIP1 and RIP3 co-localization. (f) Pdx1Cre;KrasG12D;Tp53R172H (KPC)
mice, which express mutant Kras and p53, were serially treated with Gemcitabine or PBS
and tested for expression of RIP1 and RIP3 by IHC (n=3/group). (g) Orthotopically
implanted KPC-derived tumors were harvested from Gemcitabine or PBS-treated mice and
tested for RIP1 and RIP3 expression by western blotting. Representative data and averages
of quadruplicates based on density analysis are shown. (h) KPC-derived tumor cells were
treated with Gemcitabine or PBS in vitro in triplicate and tested for gene expression by
qPCR. (i) Lysate from KPC-derived tumor cells that had been treated with PBS or
Gemcitabine were immuno-precipitated with a control Ab or α-RIP1 and tested for
expression of RIP1 and RIP3. Input controls were also probed. (j) AsPC-1 cells were treated
with PBS or Gemcitabine in triplicate and tested for gene expression by qPCR. (k) AsPC-1,
PANC1, and MIA PaCa-2 cells were cultured with PBS, Gemcitabine, or Gemcitabine + an
MLKL inhibitor in quadruplicate. Cellular viability was determined at 24h using PI. Graphs
show mean ± s.e.m. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001 (unpaired, t-test). For

Figure 2. CXCL1 is expressed in PDA in a RIP1/3 dependent manner

(a) Single cell suspensions of pancreata from 6 month-old KC mice were cultured for 24h.
Supernatant was tested for expression of inflammatory mediators. Averages of biologic
duplicates are shown. (b) Human PDA tumors were tested for co-expression of CXCL1/
CK19 and CXCL1/CD45 by confocal microscopy. Representative images are shown. (c)
Paraffin-embedded PDA sections from 10 patients were tested for expression of CXCL1 by
immunohistochemistry compared with surrounding normal pancreas. Representative ductal
and stromal areas of PDA tumors and quantitative data are shown. (d) CXCL1 levels were

tested by ELISA in tissue homogenate from 3 human PDA specimens compared with
surrounding normal pancreas. (e) Homogenized KPC tumors from PBS- or Gemcitabinetreated mice were tested for CXCL1 by ELISA. Experiments were performed in biologic
duplicates. (f) Paraffin-embedded sections from 6 month-old KC;RIP3+/+ and KC;RIP3−/−
mice were tested for expression CXCL1 by IHC (n=3/group). (g) Homogenized pancreata
from 6 month-old WT (n=6), KC;RIP3+/+ (n=4), and KC;RIP3−/− (n=4) mice were tested for
CXCL1 by ELISA. (h) KrasG12D;RIP3+/+ PDEC (n=3) and KrasG12D;RIP3−/− PDEC (n=4)
were cultured in vitro and tested for CXCL1 in 24h cell culture supernatant by ELISA. (i)
Correlation between high and low tertiles of RIP3 expression and CXCL1 expression was
tested in human PDA tissues using the UCSC RNAseq database. Each point represents data
from another patient. (j) WT or RIP3−/− mice were orthotopically implanted with KPCderived tumor cells and treated with a single dose of Gemcitabine or PBS at 3 weeks.
Tumors were harvested at 12h, homogenized, and the fold-increase in CXCL1 expression in
Gemcitabine-versus PBS-treated tumors in both WT and RIP3−/− mice was determined by
ELISA (n=5). (k) KPC-derived tumor cells were treated in triplicate in vitro with
Gemcitabine (10µM or 50µM), Nec-1s, or a RIP3 inhibitor, alone or in combination. CXCL1
levels were tested at 24h by ELISA. Experiments were repeated at least twice. Graphs show
mean ± s.e.m. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001 (unpaired, t-test).

Figure 3. RIP3 deletion or RIP1 blockade protect against pancreatic oncogenesis

(a) KC;RIP3+/+ (n=11) and KC;RIP3−/− (n=9) mice were sacrificed at 3, 6, or 9 months of
life. Representative H&E-stained sections, the percentage of pancreatic area occupied by
intact acinar structures, and the fractions of ductal structures exhibiting normal morphology,
acino-ductal metaplasia (ADM), or graded PanIN I–III lesions are shown. (b) Weights of
pancreata were compared in 3 month-old KC;RIP3+/+ (n=11) and KC;RIP3−/− (n=9) mice.
(c) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed for KC;RIP3+/+ (n=29) and KC;RIP3−/−
(n=41) mice (p<0.005). (d) Pancreata from 3 month-old KC;RIP3+/+ and KC;RIP3−/− mice
