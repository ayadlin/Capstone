BACKGROUND: There is concern that antioxidant supplement use during chemotherapy and radiation therapy may
decrease treatment effects, yet the effects of such supplements on recurrence and survival are largely unknown.
METHODS: The authors prospectively examined the associations between antioxidant use after breast cancer (BC)
diagnosis and BC outcomes in 2264 women in the Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE) cohort. The cohort
included women who were diagnosed with early stage, primary BC from 1997 to 2000 who enrolled, on average, 2
years postdiagnosis. Baseline data were collected on antioxidant supplement use since diagnosis and other factors.
BC recurrence and mortality were ascertained, and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using delayed entry Cox proportional hazards models. All tests of statistical significance were 2-sided.
RESULTS: Antioxidant supplement use after diagnosis was reported by 81% of women. Among antioxidant users, frequent use of vitamin C and vitamin E was associated with a decreased risk of BC recurrence (vitamin C: HR, 0.73;
95% CI, 0.55-0.97; vitamin E: HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.94); and vitamin E use was associated with a decreased risk of
all-cause mortality (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-1.00). Conversely, frequent use of combination carotenoids was associated
with increased risk of death from BC (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.21-3.56) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.13-2.71).
CONCLUSIONS: Frequent use of vitamin C and vitamin E in the period after BC diagnosis was associated with a
decreased likelihood of recurrence, whereas frequent use of combination carotenoids was associated with increased
mortality. The effects of antioxidant supplement use after diagnosis likely differ by type of antioxidant. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Antioxidant supplement use after a breast cancer diagnosis is common,1 but long-term effects are poorly understood.2 Concerns have been raised about antioxidant supplementation during cancer treatment; such supplementation
may possibly protect tumor cells from the pro-oxidant effects of chemotherapy and radiation,3 yet there are limited data
on recurrence and survival outcomes in women with breast cancer. Previous studies have had important limitations,
including a lack of details on antioxidant dose and frequency of use, retrospective data collection, poorly matched control
groups, small sample sizes, and limited duration of follow-up.4-8 A recent report from a well designed, prospective breast
cancer cohort study suggests that there is no harm from supplementation with multivitamins, vitamin C, and vitamin E in
the period after diagnosis and a possible benefit from supplementation in improving recurrence and survival rates.9
We used data from the Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE) Study, a prospective cohort study of women with
early stage breast cancer, to examine the association between antioxidant use in the 2-year period after diagnosis and breast

ceptor status, and treatments received, including surgery,
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy.
Tumor stage was determined based on American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria according to the
AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (fourth edition).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Outcome Ascertainment
Breast cancer recurrence and death outcomes were ascertained through November 2010 by semiannual mailed
questionnaires or annual mailed questionnaires (after
April 2005, when the average follow-up was 5 years) that
asked participants to report any major health events in the
preceding 6 months or 12 months. Nonrespondents were
contacted by telephone. Reported outcomes were verified
by a medical record review. Participant deaths were ascertained by KPNC electronic databases and by family members responding to mailed questionnaires and telephone
calls. Death certificates were obtained to verify primary
and underlying causes of death based on International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes.
Trained abstractors performed the initial reviews, and a
physician reviewer was consulted if the cause of death was
unclear. For these analyses, breast cancer recurrence was
defined as a local/regional cancer recurrence, distant recurrence/metastasis, or the development of a contralateral
primary breast cancer. Death from breast cancer was
defined as death attributable to breast cancer as the primary or underlying cause based on the death certificate
ICD-9 code. All-cause mortality was defined as death
from any cause, including breast cancer.

Study Participants
The LACE cohort (n ¼ 2264) consists of women primarily recruited from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) (83%) and the Utah (12%) cancer
registries who were diagnosed with early stage primary
breast cancer between 1997 and 2000. Women enrolled
between 2000 and 2002, approximately 1 to 3 years after a
breast cancer diagnosis (average, 1.9 years; range, 0.9-3.2
years). Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of early stage,
primary breast cancer (stage I [1 cm], stage II, or stage
IIIA); ages 18 to 79 years at diagnosis; completion of breast
cancer treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiation therapy (use of hormone therapy was permitted);
no evidence of recurrent disease; and no history of other
cancers in the 5 years before enrollment. LACE recruitment and data-collection methods have been described
elsewhere.10 The study was approved by the institutional
review boards of KPNC and the University of Utah.
Data Collection
At enrollment, a mailed, self-administered questionnaire
collected detailed data on demographics, medical history,
medication use, reproductive history, family history of
breast cancer, anthropometric measures (height, weight,
waist circumference), weight history, diet, dietary supplement use, physical activity, quality of life, and depressive
symptoms. Detailed questionnaire data were collected on
the use of antioxidant supplements. Specific questions
were asked about the use of multivitamins with and without minerals, supplements containing combinations of
multiple carotenoids (beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein,
etc), as well as the following individual supplements: betacarotene, lycopene, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and
zinc. For each supplement, questions were asked about
any use since diagnosis (yes/no), use in the 5 years before
diagnosis (yes/no), and frequency of use in the period
between breast cancer diagnosis and study enrollment
(<1 day per week, 1-2 days per week, 3-5 days per week,
or 6-7 days per week).
Clinical data were obtained using KPNC electronic
databases or medical chart review. Data included tumor
size, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor hormone re-

Variable Definitions
A 3-level exposure variable for use of each antioxidant in
the period between diagnosis and study enrollment was
created with the following categories: no use; occasional
use (<1-5 days per week); and frequent use (6-7 days per
week). A comorbidity score was calculated using a modified approach to the Charlson comorbidity index.11 Selfreported data that contributed to the score included angina, myocardial infarction, other heart problems, stroke,
insulin-dependent diabetes, noninsulin-dependent diabetes, other cancer diagnosis, cirrhosis, peripheral arterial
disease, other kidney disease, ulcer, and lupus. Each condition contributed 1 point to the score with a possible
range of 0 to 12 points.
Statistical Analyses
The primary goal of the analyses was to relate use of antioxidant supplements in the period after breast cancer

diagnosis with subsequent recurrence and death. Delayedentry Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for the association between use of individual antioxidant supplements and breast cancer outcomes, with time
since diagnosis defined as the timescale. Follow-up began
at the date of study entry and ended at the date of first
confirmed breast cancer recurrence or the date of death,
depending on the specific analysis. Individuals who did
not have an event were censored at the date of last contact.
All tests of statistical significance were 2-sided and were
considered statistically significant at an a level of .05. Initial analyses dichotomized antioxidant use into ever use
and never use. To address possible biases related to differences between antioxidant users and nonusers, subsequent
analyses were restricted to women who used at least 1
form of antioxidant supplement.12
Covariates that were selected a priori for inclusion in
the multivariable adjusted models were age at diagnosis
(continuous), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, black,
Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, other), education (less
than high school, high school graduate/some college, college graduate), AJCC disease stage (I, II, IIIA), number of
positive lymph nodes (0, 1-3, 4), tumor hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER]-negative and/or progesterone receptor [PR]-positive, ER-negative and PRnegative), chemotherapy received (yes or no), radiation
therapy received (yes or no), hormone therapy received
(yes or no), body mass index 1 year before diagnosis (<25
kg/m2, 25 to <30 kg/m2, or 30 kg/m2), smoking history at enrollment (never, former, current), alcohol consumption at enrollment (0.5 g/day, >0.5 to <6 g/day,
6 g/day), physical activity at enrollment (nonsedentary
metabolic equivalent-hours per week; continuous), daily
servings of fruit/vegetable intake at enrollment (continuous), and an enrollment comorbidity score. Additional
covariates that were considered for model inclusion were
total caloric intake and antioxidant use in the 5 years
before diagnosis; however, these were not retained in the
final models, because their inclusion did not substantially
change the effect estimates. Tests for interaction were performed between treatment received (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy) and use of specific
antioxidant supplements. Subgroup analyses, defined a
priori, were performed based on types of treatment
received. Stratified analyses were performed to examine
whether smoking was an effect modifier of the association
between antioxidant supplementation and breast cancer
outcomes. Analyses were conducted using the SAS statisti-

cal software package (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Among 2264 women, the average age was 58.3 years
(range, 25.5-79.9 years) and 80% of women were nonHispanic white. On average, women were enrolled 1.9
years after breast cancer diagnosis, at which time most had
completed chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and
had initiated hormone therapy. The majority of women
(80.3%) were diagnosed with stage I or IIA breast cancer;
and 57.2% received chemotherapy, 63% received radiation therapy, and 80.4% received hormone therapy. Over
10 years of study follow-up (mean  standard deviation:
8.3  2.4 years), 375 of the women had recurrences of
breast cancer, and we observed 393 deaths, including 214
deaths from breast cancer.
Antioxidant Supplement Use
Of the 2264 women, 1829 (81%) used 1 or more antioxidant-containing supplements. The majority of women
(70%) used a multivitamin supplement, all of which contain 1 or more antioxidant vitamins or minerals. Of the
multivitamin supplement users, most (69%) also used 1
or more other supplements that contained antioxidants.
Aside from multivitamins, other commonly reported antioxidant supplements among the 2264 women were vitamin C (40%), vitamin E (48%), zinc (10%), selenium
(7%), combination carotenoids (7%), beta-carotene alone
(6%), and lycopene alone (1%). Compared with women
who were not using any antioxidant supplements, women
who reported using antioxidant supplements were older,
more likely to be non-Hispanic white, had higher
education, had lower body mass index, were less likely to
have smoked, engaged in more physical activity, ate more
fruits and vegetables, and had a lower comorbidity score
(Table 1).

All-cause mortality

Compared with nonusers of vitamin C, frequent
users of vitamin C tended toward a lower risk of all-cause
mortality (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-1.00) (Table 2).
Compared with nonusers of vitamin E, frequent users of
vitamin E had significantly lower all-cause mortality
(HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59-0.96). In contrast, use of

combination carotenoids was associated with significantly
increased risk of all-cause mortality versus no use (HR,
1.63; 95% CI, 1.06-2.50). Relatively few women reported
using individual carotenoids that were not part of a combination supplement; and, although the CIs associated
with individual carotenoids were wide, the point estimates
suggested increased risk of mortality (beta-carotene: HR,
1.18; 95% CI, 0.71-1.97; lycopene: HR, 1.38; 95% CI,
0.41-4.61).
No statistically significant associations were
observed between occasional use of antioxidant supplements after diagnosis and any of the breast cancer outcomes (Table 2). Similarly, no statistically significant
associations were observed between use of multivitamins,
selenium, and zinc and any of the breast cancer outcomes
(Table 2).

between antioxidant supplement use and the risk of death
from breast cancer. Associations were in the same direction as those for all-cause mortality, although the only
associations that reached statistical significance were for
combination carotenoids (Table 2). Among all 2264
women, compared with nonusers, frequent users of combination carotenoids had increased risk of death from
breast cancer (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.14-3.28).
Breast cancer recurrence

Analyses were repeated to examine the associations
between antioxidant supplement use and breast cancer recurrence (Table 2). Again, associations were in the same
direction as those for all-cause mortality. Among all 2264
participants, frequent use of vitamin C and vitamin E
were associated with a lower risk of recurrence versus no
vitamin C use (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.92) and versus
no vitamin E use (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90), and the
use of combination carotenoids was associated with a suggestive increased risk of recurrence versus no use (HR,
1.23; 95% CI, 0.76-1.96).
Antioxidant Use and Breast Cancer Outcomes
Among Antioxidant Users
To control for any possible unmeasured confounding
between antioxidant users and nonusers, the analyses presented in Table 2 were rerun by restricting the group analyzed to the 1829 women who reported using 1 or more
antioxidants after diagnosis (Table 3). The results followed the same directions as those presented in Table 2.

Vitamin C and vitamin E tended to be associated with
decreased mortality, and frequent use of combination carotenoids was associated with increased mortality compared with no use (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.13-2.71).
Frequent use of combination carotenoids was associated
with increased risk of dying from breast cancer compared
with no use (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.21-3.56). Frequent use
of vitamin C and vitamin E was associated with a lower
risk of breast cancer recurrence compared with no vitamin
C use (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.97) and no vitamin E
use (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.94).
Antioxidant Use and Breast Cancer Outcomes
by Treatment Type
To examine whether associations between antioxidant
supplement use and breast cancer outcomes varied by type
of breast cancer treatment, we repeated the analyses within
groups defined by treatments received (chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, and hormone therapy) (Table 4). The
associations that were observed within each subgroup had
similar directions of effects as in the overall analyses.
All-cause mortality

Among patients who received chemotherapy and
radiation therapy, the strength of the association between
frequent use of combination carotenoids and all-cause
mortality was increased relative to the overall analyses versus no use during chemotherapy (HR, 2.09; 95% CI,
1.21-3.61) and versus no use during radiation therapy
(HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.20-3.82), although the CIs were
wide. Among women who received hormone therapy, the
strength of the association between the use of combination carotenoids and mortality remained high and had
borderline statistical significance (HR, 1.66; 95% CI,
1.00-2.73). Similarly, relative to the overall analyses, a
stronger protective effect of vitamin E was observed
among women who received radiation therapy and hormone therapy. No interactions were observed between
treatment type and the use of specific antioxidant supplements in any analyses (data not shown).
Death from breast cancer

Relative to the overall analyses, strengthened associations were observed between frequent use of combination carotenoids and death from breast cancer among
women who received chemotherapy, radiation therapy
and hormone therapy versus no use during chemotherapy
(HR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.37-4.70), versus no use during
radiation therapy (HR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.28-5.05), and

versus no use during hormone therapy (HR, 2.14; 95%
CI, 1.16-3.97).
Breast cancer recurrence

Among women who received radiation and/or hormone therapy, slightly strengthened associations were
observed relative to the overall analyses between frequent
use of vitamins C and E and decreased risk of recurrence
versus no use during radiation therapy (vitamin C: HR,
0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86; vitamin E: HR, 0.70; 95% CI,
0.49-0.98) and versus no use during hormone therapy
(vitamin C: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.99; vitamin E:
HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.96). Among women who
received chemotherapy, there was a trend toward
increased recurrence among frequent users of multiple
carotenoids versus no use (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.962.88).
Effect of Smoking
We repeated the analyses in subgroups defined by smoking status (ever/never). The associations in ever-smokers
and never-smokers were similar to the associations
observed in the overall analyses (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In a prospective cohort study of antioxidant supplement
use after breast cancer diagnosis, we report several findings. First, a large proportion of recent breast cancer survivors consumed antioxidant-containing multivitamins and
individual supplements in the early (on average, 2 years)
postdiagnosis period, which encompasses breast cancer
treatment. Second, in the 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis, women who frequently used combination carotenoids after diagnosis had an approximately 2-fold greater
risk of all-cause mortality compared with nonusers. This
association was observed even after adjustment for clinical
and behavioral prognostic risk factors and conventional
cancer therapies that may have been potential confounders. Third, frequent users of vitamin C and vitamin E supplements after diagnosis tended to have more favorable
outcomes, including decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality.
In these analyses, we observed that frequent use of
combination carotenoids in the period after diagnosis was
associated with an increased risk of death from breast cancer and from all causes, but not with an increased risk of
breast cancer recurrence. The mechanism through which
combination carotenoids may cause death is unclear, and
at least 3 scenarios are possible. It is possible that carote-

2056

noids may protect cancer cells against oxidative damage
during treatment and, thus, decrease the effects of treatment, resulting in increased breast cancer progression.3,1316
It is also possible that the increased risk of death is not
related to use of carotenoid supplements during treatment
but that carotenoid supplementation in general places a
woman at increased risk of breast cancer progression. In
the randomized trials for lung cancer prevention, beta-carotene appeared to promote existing tumors rather than
initiate tumors, as evidenced by the rapid increase in lung
cancer among the group that received beta-carotene. After
beta-carotene cessation in the Alpha-Tocopherol, BetaCarotene Prevention (ATBC) Study, there was a compensatory decrease in incidence such that, after 10 years of follow-up, there was no overall increase in incidence among
the beta-carotene group.17 Finally, carotenoid supplementation may place women at increased risk of nonbreast cancer death. The Beta-Carotene and Retinol
Efficacy Trial (CARET), a trial of beta-carotene plus retinyl palmitate among individuals at high lung cancer risk,
reported that, 6 years after the study was closed because of
harm, women who received the intervention continued to
be at increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease
(44%), lung cancer (33%), and all causes (37%).18
Although the mechanism by which carotenoid supplementation may increase mortality is not clear, our results
suggest that there may be cause for concern with carotenoid supplementation in the period after a breast cancer
diagnosis and during treatment.
We also observed that frequent use of vitamins C
and E after diagnosis was associated with reduced risk of
all-cause mortality, death from breast cancer, and breast
cancer recurrence. Our findings are similar to those
recently reported from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study (SBCSS).9 Nechuta et al examined the associations between use of antioxidants in the 6 months after
breast cancer diagnosis and observed that women who
used any form of antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C,
multivitamins) had a 22% reduced risk of recurrence and
an 18% reduced risk of death. In previous analyses within
the LACE cohort, we reported that continuous use of
multivitamins with minerals before and after breast cancer
diagnosis was associated with a 20% decreased risk of recurrence, a 32% decreased risk of breast cancer death, and
a 22% decreased risk of all-cause death.19 The protective
mechanisms by which vitamins C and E could reduce
breast cancer recurrence and mortality may be through
oxidative stress pathways related to cancer and cardiovascular disease, but the precise mechanisms are unclear.

There are important limitations to consider when
interpreting these results. First, data on antioxidant supplement use in the period after diagnosis and during treatment were collected at the point of study enrollment,
which, on average, was 1.9 years after diagnosis. Recall
bias may have affected our findings. Data on specific dates
of treatment and specific dates of antioxidant use were not
available, and it is possible that patients may have completed their breast cancer treatment before initiating antioxidant supplement use, which could have induced
misclassification. Second, we lacked information on specific doses, formulations, and duration of use. Therefore,
we have limited ability to comment on the dose threshold
for benefit or harm of supplementation with specific antioxidants. We used frequency of use as our metric of exposure intensity. We observed the strongest effects among
those who we defined as frequent users; this category identified women who were daily users and, thus, most likely
had the highest cumulative exposure. We also lacked specific information on the various formulations of combination carotenoids and do not know which carotenoids
conferred the most risk. Third, because this was an observational study, we had limited ability to establish a causal
relationship. The tendency for breast cancer survivors to
be more health conscious is well established,20,21 and the
healthy user bias may explain the findings related to vitamins C and E. At the same time, this renders our observation of increased mortality with combination carotenoid
use even more striking, because it cannot be explained by
the healthy user bias. Finally, we were unable to draw conclusions about agents that were not used frequently (betacarotene, lycopene, selenium, zinc), because we lacked
sufficient power to detect differences between groups.
In summary, we examined the association between
use of various antioxidant supplements in the period
between breast cancer diagnosis and enrollment (average,
1.9 years) into a prospective study of early stage breast
cancer survivors on breast cancer outcomes. We hypothesized that outcomes would differ by type of antioxidant
supplement and observed that, in fact, outcomes did differ. We observed protective associations between the use
of vitamin C and vitamin E and breast cancer recurrence
and death from all causes that may be true associations or
could be caused by a healthy user bias. However, we
observed that the use of combination carotenoids was
associated with increased risks of death from breast cancer
and of death from all causes that cannot be explained by
healthy user bias. To our knowledge, this is the first report
from a prospective study suggesting possible harm from

Cancer

using a specific type of antioxidant supplement after a
breast cancer diagnosis. Our findings should be considered hypothesis-generating and need to be replicated in
other study settings.
