Bryostatin analog: improving on Nature’s design

Commentary on: Dechristopher B et al. “Picolog,” a synthetically-available bryostatin analog, inhibits growth of MYC-induced
lymphoma in vivo. Oncotarget 2012; 3: 58-66.

bryostatin has also emerged as an exciting lead for
treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, and for purging latent
reservoir stores of HIV that are challenging to access in
the treatment of AIDS. As such, the present demonstration
of the well tolerated in vivo activity of a simplified
bryostatin indicates that they, or the appropriate analog
subset, may be especially useful in the treatment of other
human diseases going forward. At the very least, they will
help identify new mechanisms of action relevant to these
diseases and define the pharmacological characteristics
candidate drugs should embody.
Beyond this, the work is especially significant on
several levels. First, by combining the power of stateof-the-art synthetic chemistry, fundamental chemical
and structural design principles, modern biology and
pharmacology, and innovative technology, new candidate
drugs have been created that will not only likely find their
way into the clinic, but have or will define new targets and
mechanisms of action by which human disease may be
treated. Second, and more subtle, the work going forward
will undoubtedly define which subset of the constellation
of biological properties of bryostatin are responsible for
the productive activity useful for treating human disease
and identify which bryostatin structural features convey
or potentiate these properties. These latter studies provide
opportunities to improve on Nature’s design, providing
drugs that are not only more accessible, but are also more
tailored for an intended human use.

The article of Felsher and Wender entitled “Picolog,
a synthetically-available bryostatin analog, inhibits growth
of MYC-induced lymphoma in vivo” represents a very
important key step enroute to the clinical exploration
of members of this natural product class [1]. Although
bryostatin 1 entered clinical trials, the difficulty in
securing sufficient amounts of material from natural
sources to ultimately support its clinical use, even with
its extraordinary potency, led to their discontinuation in
anticipation of synthetic replacements on the horizon
[2]. The candidate replacements in this study have come
from the Wender laboratory, using cutting-edge synthetic
chemistry to prepare well-conceived designed analogs
used to explore the structure-function properties and
mechanism(s) of action of molecules in the class. In
these efforts, simplified and synthetically more accessible
candidate drugs have emerged from a >20 year program
that express more potent and/or altered selectivity for the
identified biological targets of the natural products [3-5].
One of these, the exceptionally potent “picolog”, has now
been examined in vivo in collaboration with Felsher [6-7],
providing efficacious anti-neoplastic activity in a clinically
relevant animal model and compelling data is presented
that accessible replacements for bryostatin 1 are on the
way.
Thus, the study presents the successful results of the
first examination of a bryostatin analog in an animal model
indicating that it is both efficacious and well tolerated. The
work utilized a conditional model of aggressive, MYCinduced T cell lymphoma relevant to clinical applications
of bryostatin 1 and provides a valuable pharmacological
tool for studying such oncogene induced malignancies
going forward. Additionally, the studies showed that
picolog, like bryostatin 1, induces apoptosis and operates
by a mechanism involving PKC activation. Here, the
authors utilized a novel nano-immuno assay (NIA) that
allowed them to precisely quantify markers of PKC
pathway activation in vivo in real time [8-9]. They found
that two distinct phosphorylated forms of MEK2 in the
PKC pathway were induced by picolog treatment. With
these advances, it will be exciting to see how a series of
bryostatin analogs performs in such in vivo models and
how this correlates with novel in vivo biomarkers of their
anticipated mechanisms of action.
Although the present study has focused on oncology,
