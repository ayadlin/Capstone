ABSTRACT
Cancer cells preferentially use aerobic glycolysis to meet their increased
energetic and biosynthetic demands, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect.
Its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. RRAD, a small GTPase, is a potential
tumor suppressor in lung cancer. RRAD expression is frequently down-regulated in
lung cancer, which is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Recently,
RRAD was reported to repress the Warburg effect, indicating that down-regulation
of RRAD expression is an important mechanism contributing to the Warburg effect
in lung cancer. However, the mechanism by which RRAD inhibits the Warburg
effect remains unclear. Here, we found that RRAD negatively regulates the NF-κB
signaling to inhibit the GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect in lung cancer
cells. Mechanically, RRAD directly binds to the p65 subunit of the NF-κB complex and
inhibits the nuclear translocation of p65, which in turn negatively regulates the NFκB signaling to inhibit GLUT1 translocation and the Warburg effect. Blocking the NFκB signaling largely abolishes the inhibitory effects of RRAD on the translocation of
GLUT1 to the plasma membrane and the Warburg effect. Taken together, our results
revealed a novel mechanism by which RRAD negatively regulates the Warburg effect
in lung cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

For instance, oncogenes AKT, c-Myc, Ras and HIF-1α
promote the Warburg effect, whereas tumor suppressors
p53 and PTEN inhibit the Warburg effect in cancer cells
[4-8].
RRAD, a member of the Ras-like small GTPase
family, was initially identified as a gene associated with
Type II diabetes since it was found to be overexpressed in
some Type II diabetic patients [9]. RRAD overexpression
reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cultured
muscle and adipocytes cells [10]. Recent studies have
suggested a tumor suppressive function of RRAD in some
types of human cancers. RRAD was found to be frequently
down-regulated in different types of human cancers,
including lung cancer, breast cancer, and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, etc, due to the hypermethylation of its promoter

Majority of cancer cells preferentially use aerobic
glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation to meet
their increased energetic and biosynthetic demands.
This switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic
glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer cells, which has long
been known as the Warburg effect [1-4]. The Warburg
effect has been recently demonstrated to be a key
contributor to tumorigenesis, and can be targeted for
cancer therapy [3-5]. However, the molecular mechanism
underlying the Warburg effect in cancer cells is not
fully understood. Recently, many oncogenes or tumor
suppressor genes have been reported to be involved in
the metabolic switch of cancer cells to aerobic glycolysis.

[11-15]. Furthermore, the down-regulation of RRAD was
reported to be associated with tumor progression and poor
prognosis in cancer patients [11-15]. Recently, RRAD was
identified as p53-regulated gene, which mediates p53’s
function in inhibition of cancer metastasis [12]. Our recent
study showed that RRAD negatively regulates glycolysis
through the inhibition of the translocation of glucose
transporter 1 (GLUT1) to the plasma membrane in lung
cancer cells [16]. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) mediate
the transport of glucose across the plasma membrane
of cells, which is the first rate-limiting step for glucose
metabolism. GLUT1 is widely expressed in almost all
types of cells and tissues, and is responsible for their basal
glucose uptake [17]. Ectopic expression of RRAD downregulates glycolysis whereas knockdown of endogenous
RRAD enhances glycolysis [16]. These findings strongly
suggest that the down-regulation of RRAD expression
could be an important mechanism contributing to the
Warburg effect in human lung cancer cells. However, the
mechanism by which RRAD inhibits GLUT1 translocation
and the Warburg effect remains unclear.
In this study, we demonstrated that RRAD directly
binds to the p65 subunit of the NF-κB complex and
inhibits p65 nuclear translocation to negatively regulate
the NF-κB signaling. Through down-regulating the NF-κB
signaling, RRAD inhibits the GLUT1 translocation to the
plasma membrane and the Warburg effect in lung cancer
cells. Blocking the NF-κB signaling largely abolishes the
inhibitory effects of RRAD on GLUT1 translocation to
the plasma membrane and therefore the Warburg effect.
Thus, our results revealed a novel mechanism by which
RRAD negatively regulates the Warburg effect in lung
cancer cells.

stably transduced with a control pLPCX vector (H1299con) were employed for assays. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS
assays identified p65, a subunit of the transcription factor
nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) complex, as a potential binding
protein for RRAD.
The NF-κB and its signaling pathway, which is
frequently activated in various types of human cancers,
play a pivotal role in tumorgenesis [21, 22]. The activated
NF-κB signaling has been reported to promote the
Warburg effect in cancer cells, although its underlying
mechanism is not well-understood [23-26]. A recent
study reported that the NF-κB activation promotes the
translocation of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane, which
could be an important mechanism for NF-κB to promote
the Warburg effect in cancer cells [27]. To confirm the
interaction between RRAD and p65, we performed Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays in H1299 cells.
Ectopically expressed RRAD-Flag formed a complex
with ectopically expressed p65-HA in H1299 cells
transfected with pCMV-RRAD-Flag and pCMV-p65HA expression vectors (Figure 1A). This interaction
was further confirmed by the observation of the protein
complex formed between the endogenous RRAD and p65
in H1299 cells (Figure 1B).
The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a critical role
in regulating gene expression [21, 22]. To investigate
the effect of RRAD on the transcriptional activity of
NF-κB, human lung H1299 and H460 cells with ectopic
expression of RRAD or knockdown of endogenous RRAD
by shRNA vectors were transfected with the pGL4.32
NF-κB luciferase reporter vector which contains NFκB responsive DNA elements for luciferase reporter
assays. Cells were then treated with or without TNF-α,
a cytokine that has a well-known activating effect on
the NF-κB signaling [21, 22]. Results from luciferase
reporter assays showed that RRAD significantly inhibited
the NF-κB transcriptional activities; ectopic expression
of RRAD reduced luciferase activities of the NF-κB
reporter vector in H1299 and H460 cells treated with or
without TNF-α (Figure 1C), Consistently, knockdown of
RRAD by shRNA vectors significantly induced the NF-κB
luciferase activities in above-mentioned cells under both
TNF-α untreated or treated conditions (Figure 1D). These
results together indicated that RRAD interacts with p65
and inhibits the NF-κB signaling.

RESULTS
RRAD binds to p65 and inhibits the NF-κB
signaling
Our previous study has shown that RRAD
negatively regulates the glycolysis through inhibiting
GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane in
human lung cancer cells [16]. However, it remains
unclear how RRAD inhibits GLUT1 translocation to
negatively regulate glycolysis in cells. RRAD has been
reported to exert many functions through its interaction
with other proteins in cells [18-20]. To investigate the
mechanism by which RRAD represses the glycolysis,
we screened for the potential interacting proteins for
RRAD by immunoprecipitation (IP) combined with
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) assays. Human lung cancer H1299-RRAD cells

RRAD negatively regulates the Warburg effect
through inhibiting the NF-κB signaling
The NF-κB activation has been reported to promote
the Warburg effect in cancer cells [23-26]. Consistent with
previous reports [23-26], activation of NF-κB by ectopic
expression of p65 with the pCMV-p65-HA vector clearly
promoted glucose uptake, the glycolytic rate and lactate
production in both H1299 and H460 cells (Figure 2A).

RRAD inhibits GLUT1 translocation through
inhibiting the NF-κB signaling

Here, we investigated whether RRAD down-regulates the
Warburg effect through its down-regulation of the NF-κB
signaling in lung cancer cells. While ectopic expression of
RRAD significantly inhibited the Warburg effect, blocking
the NF-κB signaling by knockdown of the endogenous
p65 with siRNA oligos largely abolished the inhibitory
effects of RRAD overexpression on the Warburg effect in
H1299 and H460 cells (Figure 2B). Furthermore, while
knockdown of endogenous RRAD by shRNA vectors
significantly promoted the Warburg effect in H1299 and
H460 cells, knockdown of the endogenous p65 by siRNA
oligos largely abolished the promoting effects of RRAD
knockdown on the Warburg effect in H1299 (Figure 2C)
and H460 cells (Figure 2D). These results strongly suggest
that RRAD negatively regulates the Warburg effect
through its down-regulation of the NF-κB signaling.

A recent study reported that the activated NFκB signaling promotes the translocation of GLUT1
to the plasma membrane to facilitate glucose uptake,
which could be an important mechanism by which NFκB activates the Warburg effect [27]. Together with
our finding that RRAD negatively regulates the NF-κB
signaling, these findings raised a possibility that RRAD
inhibits the GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane
through its negative regulation of the NF-κB signaling,
which could be an important mechanism by which
RRAD inhibits GLUT1 translocation. Consistent with
this previous report [27], our results clearly showed that
the NF-B activation promoted the GLUT1 translocation
to the plasma membrane and therefore enhanced the
Warburg effect in lung cancer cells. Ectopic expression of
p65 by the pCMV-p65 expression vector greatly promoted
the translocation of endogenous GLUT1 to the plasma
membrane as shown by Western-blot assays using the

isolated plasma membrane fraction of H1299 and H460
cells (Figure 3A). Furthermore, knockdown of p65 by
siRNA reduced the translocation of endogenous GLUT1 to
the plasma membrane in cells (Figure 3B). To confirm this
result, cells with p65 overexpression or knockdown were
transduced with pLPCX-Myc-GLUT1 vectors that express
GLUT1 with Myc tag in its first exofacial loop, and the
levels of Myc-GLUT1 on the cell surface or in the whole
cell were measured by immunofluorescence (IF) staining
with an anti-Myc antibody followed by flow cytometry
analysis. While p65 overexpression or knockdown did
not affect the total levels of Myc-GLUT1 in cells, p65
overexpression significantly increased the levels of MycGLUT1 protein on the cell surface (Figure 3B, left panel),
whereas p65 knockdown significantly reduced the levels
of Myc-GLUT1 protein on the cell surface (Figure 3B,
right panel). Our results further showed that knockdown
of the endogenous GLUT1 by siRNA largely abolished
the promoting effects of NF-κB activation on glucose
uptake, the glycolytic rate and lactate production in
H1299 and H460 cells with overexpression of p65 (Figure
3C). These results together indicate that activated NF-κB
signaling promotes the translocation of GLUT1 to the
plasma membrane to facilitate glucose uptake, which is an
important mechanism for NF-κB to activate the Warburg
effect in cancer cells.
We further investigated whether RRAD inhibits
GLUT1 translocation through negative regulation of the
NF-κB signaling. As shown in Figure 3D and E, blocking
the NF-κB signaling by knockdown of endogenous
p65 largely abolished the inhibitory effects of RRAD
overexpression on GLUT1 translocation in H1299 and
H460 cells (Figure 3D), and also largely abolished the
promoting effects of RRAD knockdown on GLUT1
translocation (Figure 3E). These results strongly suggest
that RRAD inhibits GLUT1 translocation to the plasma
membrane mainly through its inhibition of the NF-κB
signaling, which is an important mechanism for RRAD to
inhibit the Warburg effect.

contrast, deletion of N-terminal residues (∆N88 mutant)
largely abolished the RRAD binding to p65-HA.
Furthermore, deletion of C-terminal residues 249-308
(∆C249 mutant) did not significantly reduce the inhibitory
effects of RRAD on the luciferase activities of the NF-κB
(Figure 4C) and glucose uptake (Figure 4D) in H1299 and
H460 cells. In contrast, deletion of N-terminal residues
(∆N88 mutant) largely abolished the inhibitory effects
of RRAD on luciferase activities of the NF-κB (Figure
4C) and glucose uptake (Figure 4D) in cells. These results
indicate that the N-terminus of RRAD is essential for the
interaction of RRAD with p65, as well as for the function
of RRAD in inhibiting GLUT1 translocation and the
Warburg effect.

RRAD
inhibits
TNF-α-induced
translocation of the p65

The NF-κB is normally kept in an inactive state
in the cytoplasm. In response to stimuli, such as TNF-α
treatment, NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus, where it
activates gene transcription [21, 22]. IF staining results
showed that RRAD-Flag was mainly localized in the
cytoplasm, where it colocalized with p65 in H1299
cells untreated with TNF-α (Figure 5A). While TNF-α
greatly promoted the p65 nuclear translocation in H1299
cells, ectopic expression of RRAD greatly reduced the
p65 nuclear translocation induced by TNF-α in H1299
cells as detected by Western-blot assays (Figure 5B).
Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous RRAD by
shRNA vectors clearly promoted the TNF-α-induced
p65 nuclear translocation (Figure 5C). IF staining assays
showed the consistent results in H1299 cells (Figure 5D).
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that RRAD
interacts with p65 and inhibits its nuclear translocation
to negatively regulate NF-κB activities, which in turn
represses the Warburg effect in cancer cells (Figure 5E).

DISSCUSSION

RRAD interacts with p65 through its N-terminus

The Warburg effect is one of the hallmarks of cancer
cells [1, 2, 6]. The switch from oxidative phosphorylation
to glycolysis provides a critical mechanism for cancer
cells to meet their dramatically increased energetic and
biosynthetic demands to support their rapid growth and
proliferation. Understanding the mechanism underlying
the Warburg effect could lead to the development of new
strategies for cancer therapy. The evidence that many
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes are involved in the
metabolic switch of cancer cells to glycolysis indicates
that genetic alterations during tumorigenesis are also
playing critical roles in regulation of the Warburg effect
in cancer cells [5, 6]. The NF-κB signaling pathway is
frequently activated in various types of human cancers,
including lung cancer, and plays an important role in

To define the binding region of RRAD with p65, two
Flag-tagged deletion mutants of RRAD were constructed
and cloned into pCMV-Flag vectors, including ∆N88
(deletion of the N-terminal 88 amino acids) and ∆C249
(deletion of the C-terminal 59 amino acids) (Figure
4A). Both N-terminus and C-terminus of RRAD have
been reported to be important for interacting with other
proteins [18-20]. These two mutant vectors or wild-type
(WT) RRAD-Flag expression vectors were transfected
into H1299 cells together with the pCMV-p65-HA vector,
and their binding to p65-HA protein were analyzed by CoIP assays. As shown in Figure 4B, deletion of C-terminal
residues 249-308 (∆C249 mutant) did not significantly
affect the ability of RRAD-Flag to bind to p65-HA. In

tumor initiation and progression [21, 22]. The activated
NF-κB signaling has been reported to promote the
Warburg effect in cancer cells, although its underlying
mechanism is not well-understood [23]. Recently, the NFκB activation was reported to promote the translocation
of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane, which could be an
important mechanism for NF-κB to promote the Warburg
effect in cancer cells [27].
RRAD was recently reported to play a potential
role in tumor suppression, particularly in lung cancer
[11-14]. Its expression is frequently down-regulated in
different types of cancers, including lung cancer, and
the hypermethylation of its promoter is an important
mechanism [11-14]. Restoration of RRAD expression in
cancer cells inhibits tumor growth and metastasis [11-14].
Our previous study showed that RRAD inhibits glycolysis
through inhibiting GLUT1 membrane translocation in lung
cancer cells, which suggests that the frequently-observed
down-regulation of RRAD expression in lung cancer
could be an important mechanism for the Warburg effect
in lung cancer cells. However, its underlying mechanism
was unclear.
In this study, we investigated the mechanism by
which RRAD inhibits GLUT1 translocation and the

Warburg effect in lung cancer cells. Using LC-MS/MS
assays, we screened for the potential interacting proteins
for RRAD, which led to the identification of p65 as an
important binding protein of RRAD. This interaction
resulted in the inhibition of p65 nuclear localization
and therefore the reduced transcription activities of NFκB. Our results confirmed that the activation of NF-κB
promoted GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane
as an important mechanism by which NF-κB activates the
Warburg effect in cancer cells. Furthermore, we found
that RRAD inhibited the GLUT1 translocation and the
Warburg effect mainly through the down-regulation of
NF-κB activities. Blocking the NF-κB signaling largely
abolished the inhibitory effects of RRAD on GLUT1
translocation and the Warburg effect. Currently, it still
remains largely unclear how NF-κB regulates GLUT1
translocation. Future studies should shed further light on
its detailed molecular mechanism. In summary, the results
from this study demonstrated that RRAD inhibits GLUT1
translocation and glycolysis through its direct interaction
with p65 and inhibition of the NF-κB signaling, which
revealed a novel mechanism by which RRAD negatively
regulates the Warburg effect in cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western-blot assays
Western-blot assays were performed as we
previously described [16, 29]. Following antibodies were
employed for assays: anti-RRAD (a generous gift from Dr.
CR Kahn, Harvard Medical School); anti-Flag (Sigma);
anti-HA (Santa Cruz); anti-p65 (Santa Cruz); anti-GLUT1
(Abcam); anti- Na+/K+ ATPase (Novus); anti-PCNA (Santa
Cruz); anti-Calnexin (Abcam), and anti-Actin (Sigma).
Western-blot results were analyzed by using Image J 1.45s
software (NIH).

Cells and vectors
Human lung epithelial cancer H1299 and H460
cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). For
cells with stable ectopic RRAD overexpression, cells
were transduced with a pLPCX-RRAD-Flag retroviral
vector and selected by puromycin [16]. The pCMVRRAD-Flag WT and deletion mutations were constructed
by PCR amplification. pCMV-p65-HA vector was
constructed by using DNA fragment from pCMV4-p65
(Addgene). The lentiviral shRNA vectors against human
RRAD (V3LHS_364015 and V3LHS_409093) were
obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). To
avoid off-target effects, two different siRNA oligos
against each gene were employed for all knockdown
experiments. The siRNA oligos against human GLUT1
(5’CGAACTATGAACTACAAAGCTTCTA-3’
and
5’-TCAAAGTTCCTGAGACTAAA
GGCCG-3’)
and
human
p65
(5’-GGAGTACCCTGAGGCTATAACTCGC-3’
and
5’- AGCACAGATACCACCAAGACCCACC-3’) were
obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. Vectors
and siRNA oligos were transfected into cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

NF-κB luciferase reporter assays
For luciferase activity assays, the NF-κB luciferase
reporter vector, pGL4.32 (luc2P/NF-κB-RE/Hygro,
Promega), which contains five copies of an NF-κB
responsive DNA element that drives transcription of
the luciferase reporter gene was employed. Cells were
co-transfected with the luciferase reporter vector and
pRL-null vector expressing renilla luciferase as an
internal control to normalize the transfection efficiency
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 24 h after
transfection, cells were treated with or without TNF- (10
ng/ml) for 6 h before luciferase assays. The luciferase
activities were detected as previously described [30, 31].

Measurement of glucose uptake, the glycolytic
rate and lactate production in cells

LC-MS/MS analysis
To determine the potential RRAD binding proteins,
RRAD-Flag protein in H1299-RRAD cells was pulled
down by IP using anti-Flag (M2) beads and eluted with
0.1M glycine solution. H1299-con cells were used as a
control. Eluted materials were separated in a 4-16% SDSPAGE gel and visualized by silver staining using the
silver staining kit (Invitrogen). LC-MS/MS analysis was
performed at the Biological Mass Spectrometry facility of
Rutgers University.

Glucose uptake in cells was analyzed by measuring
the uptake of 3H-2-deoxyglucose [30, 32]. Briefly, cells
cultured in 12-well plates were pre-incubated in glucosefree media for 30 min before 3H-2-deoxyglucose (1
μCi/well) was added to the cells. After incubation for
30 min, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1%
SDS. The radioactivity of cell lysates was determined
in a liquid scintillation counter and normalized to the
protein concentrations of cell lysates. The glycolytic rate
in cells was measured by monitoring the conversion of
5-3H-glucose to 3H2O [30, 33]. Briefly, cells (1x106)
were collected and washed in PBS before they were
resuspended in 1 mL of Krebs buffer without glucose for
30 min. Cells were collected and resuspended in 0.5 mL
of Krebs buffer containing 10 mM glucose and 5 μCi of
5-[3H]glucose for 1 h. Triplicate 100 μL aliquots were
transferred to uncapped PCR tubes containing 100 μL of
0.2 N HCl, and a tube was transferred to a scintillation
vial containing 0.5 mL of H2O. The scintillation vials
were sealed and left for 48 h. The amounts of diffused
and undiffused 3H were then determined in a liquid
scintillation counter. The cell lactate production levels
were determined by using a Lactate Assay Kit (Biovision)
[30]. In brief, cells were cultured in fresh phenol red-free

Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays
Co-IP assays were performed as we previously
described [28]. In brief, cell lysates were prepared
using NP-40 buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1% NP40, 150mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) and incubated with IP
matrix (Santa Cruz) conjugated to IP antibody (anti-HA,
Santa Cruz; or anti-Flag M2, Sigma) for overnight. The
IP matrix-antibody complex was then washed with NP-40
buffer, and protein complexes were eluted and subjected
to Western-blot assays.

Analysis of endogenous levels of GLUT1 on
plasma membrane

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The plasma membrane fraction of cells was
isolated from the other membrane fractions of cells which
include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as we previously
described [16, 34]. The levels of GLUT1 in the plasma
membrane fraction were measured by Western-blot assays.
Na+/K+ ATPase, a plasma membrane protein, was detected
as an internal standard. Calnexin, an ER membrane
protein, was detected to exclude the contamination of
plasma membrane by the other membrane fractions that
include the ER. Whole cell extracts were used to measure
the total GLUT1 levels in cells.

Cells were transduced with pLPCX-Myc-GLUT1
vectors which express the GLUT1 with Myc tag in the
first exofacial loop [16, 34]. At 48 h after transduction, the
levels of Myc-GLUT1 on the cell surface and in whole
cells were measured by IF staining in a flow cytometer
as we previously described [16, 34]. The relative levels
of Myc-GLUT1 on the cell surface were calculated after
normalization with the total levels of Myc-GLUT1 in
cells. Cells transduced with empty pLPCX vectors were
used as negative controls.
