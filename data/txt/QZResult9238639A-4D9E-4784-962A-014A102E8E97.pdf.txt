Abstract
Recent studies suggest that chemotherapy, in addition to its cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, can induce a
cascade of host events to support tumor growth and spread. Here, we used an experimental pulmonary metastasis
model to investigate the role of this host response in metastasis formation. Mice were pretreated with
chemotherapy and after clearance of the drugs from circulation, tumor cells were administered intravenously
to study potential "protumorigenic" host effects of chemotherapy. Pretreatment with the commonly used
chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin and paclitaxel signiﬁcantly enhanced lung metastasis in this model. This
corresponded to enhanced adhesion of tumor cells to an endothelial cell monolayer that had been pretreated with
chemotherapy in vitro. Interestingly, chemotherapy exposure enhanced the expression of VEGF receptor 1
(VEGFR-1) on endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Administration of antibodies targeting VEGFR-1 reversed
the early retention of tumor cells in the lungs, thereby preventing the formation of chemotherapy-induced
pulmonary metastases. The data indicate that chemotherapy-induced expression of VEGFR-1 on endothelial cells
can create an environment favorable to tumor cell homing. Inhibition of VEGFR-1 function may therefore be used
to counteract chemotherapy-induced retention of tumor cells within the metastatic niche, providing a novel level
of tumor control in chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 71(22); 6976–85. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Not all cancer patients treated with chemotherapy show
response to treatment. Moreover, a small subset of patients
experiences early progression during systemic anticancer therapy. Prime examples include accelerated growth of non–small
cell lung cancers in patients after induction chemotherapy (1),
and rapid tumor cell proliferation in oropharyngeal cancer
patients who responded poorly to chemotherapy (2).
This early progression during therapy is generally thought to
be part of the natural course of disease, meaning that the tumor
would have progressed in a similar fashion if it had not been
treated. However, accumulating evidence suggests that chemotherapy may also induce tumor-promoting changes in the
microenvironment as part of a systemic host response. Blood
of cancer patients treated with chemotherapy contains
increased levels of several protumorigenic growth factors and

mobilized bone marrow-derived progenitor cells, that can
home to the tumor and subsequently contribute to angiogenesis (3, 4). High levels of these cells correspond to primary
tumor progression in mice and decreased survival in patients
(3, 4). Thus, in addition to the direct effects of the therapy on
the cancer, chemotherapy elicits a host response that can be
tumor growth promoting (5). Beneﬁts of anticancer treatment
must therefore be weighed with respect to potential protumorigenic effects.
We hypothesized that when tumors can overcome the
potent, cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy through resistance,
the signals to the microenvironment will obfuscate the beneﬁts
of treatment and may actually facilitate disease progression
and metastatic spread.
To study the host effects occurring postchemotherapy, an
experimental mouse metastasis model was designed in which
the direct, cytotoxic antitumor effects were absent. Mice were
pretreated with chemotherapy and after clearance of the drug
from circulation, tumor cells were administered intravenously.
Using this model, we here show that pretreatment with 2
widely used chemotherapeutic agents enhanced lung metastasis formation. This phenomenon was observed in several
mouse strains, injected intravenously with different tumor cell
lines. Chemotherapy pretreatment resulted in an early accumulation of tumor cells in mouse lungs, which corresponded to
enhanced adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells exposed
to cytotoxic agents in vitro. Moreover, our data indicate that
membrane expression of VEGFR-1 was upregulated by endothelial cells in response to chemotherapy. Finally, systemic

Chemotherapy-Induced Metastases

administration of antibodies targeting VEGFR-1 reversed the
chemotherapy-induced tumor cell retention in the lungs,
reducing the number of lung colonies.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
C26 colon carcinoma cells and COS-7 were maintained in
Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM; Lonza) with 5%
fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mmol/L glutamine, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin. C26 cells expressing the
ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene (C26-luc) were described previously (6).
B16F10 cells were maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen) with 5%
FCS and antibiotics. bEND.3 immortalized microvascular ECs
were a gift of M. Verhaar, UMC Utrecht, and were maintained in
DMEM (1 g/L glucose) with 10% FCS and antibiotics. 6011L
primary C57Bl/6 lung ECs were purchased from Cell Biologics,
maintained in accompanying M1166 growth medium and
grown on gelatin-coated plates. All cells were kept at 37 C in
a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2.
Tumor and mouse models
All animal procedures were approved by the UMC Utrecht
Animal Care Ethics Committee. BALB/c and C57Bl/6 mice, n 
6/group (Charles River) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.)
with chemotherapy at MTD levels: cisplatin 6 mg/kg, paclitaxel
20 mg/kg (Pharmachemie BV), or vehicle controls. Four days
later, 4  104 C26 (-mCh) cells were i.v. injected into the tail
veins of BALB/c mice, or 6  103 C26 cells into Rag2/;
IL2Rgc/BALB/c mice (7), or 1  105 B16F10 mouse melanoma cells into C57Bl/6 mice. Anti-mouse VEGFR-1 antibody
MF1 and anti-mouse VEGFR-2 antibody DC101 were kindly
provided by ImClone Systems Inc. One day before injection of
tumor cells, MF1 (40 mg/kg), DC101 (800 mg/mouse) or a
vehicle control was administered i.p.
Bioluminescence imaging
Mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (IsoFlo, Abbott
Laboratories Inc.) and i.p. injected with n-luciferin (potassium
salt; Biosynth AG) at 225 mg/kg, 13 days after tumor cell
injection. C26-luc lung metastases were assessed by in vivo
bioluminescence imaging (BLI) using a Biospace  imager and
M3 vision software (Biospace Lab). The integrated light intensity as measured by single photon counting of a 10-minute
exposure was used to quantify the amount of light emitted by
C26-luc cells. A low intensity visible light image was made for
overlay images.
Lentiviral transduction
For C26-mCh, lentiviral particles were produced by
seeding 1.2  106 Cos-7 cells onto a 10-cm dish and
transient transfection using fuGENE-6 Transfection
Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) with third-generation packaging constructs (8) and a CMV-mCherry transfer vector
containing a puromycine selection cassette (a gift from C.
L€
owik, Leiden UMC, Leiden, the Netherlands). After 48
hours, supernatant was harvested, ﬁltered, and used to
transduce 105 C26 cells with 40 mg/mL polybrene. Trans-

duction was repeated after 24 hours and 24 hours later
puromycine selection was initiated.
Identiﬁcation of C26-mCh cells in mouse lungs
C26-mCh cells were i.v. injected into mice that had been
pretreated with chemotherapy or vehicle controls. Twentyfour hours after injection, lungs were perfused via the left
ventricle with PBS-EDTA followed by 1% PFA. Subsequently,
3% agarose/0.5% PFA was administered via the trachea into the
lungs. Lungs were harvested and kept on ice, before ﬁxation in
4% PFA. Vibrotome sections (300 um) of lungs were stained
with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and per lung 10
random 3-dimensional ﬁelds were evaluated for mCherryexpressing cells on a Zeiss LSM 510 META (40). Zeiss LSM
Image Brower software Version 4.2.0.121 was used.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Vibrotome sections were prepared, blocked with goat serum,
stained with rat-anti-mouse CD31 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) and rabbit-anti-mouse VEGFR-1 (Santa Cruz), followed by
488-/647-conjugated secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor, Molecular Probes Inc.) and DAPI. CLSM evaluation was done.
Flow cytometry
Mice were pretreated with chemotherapy or vehicle. Organs
were harvested 4 days later and single cell suspensions were
prepared by cutting and DNAse/collagenase treatment. Cells
were stained for 30 minutes in PBS-BSA-EDTA with antibodies
or isotypes. VEGFR-1-PE antibodies were obtained from R&D
Sytems, CD31-APC and isotype controls from eBioscience,
CD11b-FITC from Miltenyi Biotec. Remaining ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) antibodies were obtained from
BD Biosciences Pharmingen: CXCR4-FITC, VEGFR-2-PE,
CD45-PerCP, CD117-APC, and VCAM-1-FITC. After RBC lysis,
analysis was done on a FACSCalibur II. For in vitro FACS
experiments, bEND.3 cells were plated out in 6-well plates.
After 24 hours, cisplatin was added for 4 hours. Cells were
washed twice with PBS and put on DMEM. Four days later, cells
were harvested, stained for VEGFR-1 and analyzed.
MTT assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates and cultured for 24 hours.
MF1 or DC101 were added (50 mg/mL) and MTT assays (Roche
Diagnostics) were done every 24 hours as per manufacturer's
instructions.
EC adhesion assays
bEND3 or 6011L monolayers were grown in 96-wells plates,
treated with cisplatin, paclitaxel or vehicle for 4 hours, washed
twice with PBS and maintained on medium for 3 days. After
washing with PBS, the plate was blocked with 2.5% BSA (SigmaAldrich), and incubated for 4 hours with PMA, Mn2þ, TNFa,
IL-1b, or PBS. Integrin b1 or b3 (BD Pharmingen) antibodies
were added 1:200. C26 tumor cells were loaded with 4 mmol/L
calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) in HBSS. VCAM-1 and
ICAM-1 antibodies (BD Pharmingen) were added 1:200. A total
of 5  104 calcein-labeled C26 were added to triplicate wells.
After 50 minutes at 37 C, nonadhered cells were removed and

potential effects on metastatic spread (Fig. 1A). In this experimental lung metastasis model, mice were pretreated with
chemotherapy, followed by intravenous tumor cell injection 4
days later, after the chemotherapeutic agents had been cleared
from circulation. Administration of tumor cells after drug
clearance prevents direct cytotoxic effects on the tumor cells,
but allows investigation of drug-induced host effects. Thirteen
days after tumor cell injection, lung colonies were analyzed.
When BALB/c mice were pretreated with either of 2 commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, paclitaxel or cisplatin,
followed by intravenous injection of C26 mouse colon carcinoma cells, a signiﬁcantly enhanced number of lung colonies
was present after 13 days (Fig. 1B). Paclitaxel augmented lung
colony formation more than 3-fold, whereas cisplatin gave rise
to a 6-fold increase compared with untreated mice. This
corresponded to a signiﬁcant increase in lung weight of these

Chemotherapy-Induced Metastases

mice for cisplatin-treated animals (Fig. 1C). We next conducted
BLI 13 days after injection of luciferase-expressing C26 tumor
cells (C26-luc). Figure 1D shows an increase in lung colonization upon pretreatment with cisplatin compared with the
untreated mice.
To conﬁrm that these effects can be attributed to a general
phenomenon, we repeated the experiments in C57Bl/6 mice
that were intravenously injected with B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. Consistent with our ﬁndings in BALB/c mice, chemotherapy pretreatment resulted in enhanced pulmonary
metastasis (Fig. 1E).
To determine whether suppression of the immune system by
chemotherapy played a role in the enhanced number of lung
metastases observed in these experiments, we carried out an
identical experiment in Rag2/;IL2Rgc/ BALB/c female
mice (7). In these immune-deﬁcient animals-–that lack Blymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, and NK-cells—similar results of
chemotherapy pretreatment were found (Fig. 1F). These
results indicate that suppression of any of these 3 components
of the adaptive immune system by chemotherapy does not
account for the observed effect.
Furthermore, dextran perfusion studies were done to study
the integrity of the lung vasculature. Cisplatin pretreatment
did not increase vascular leakage at the time of tumor cell
injection (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Chemotherapy enhances early retention of tumor cells
in the lungs
To determine whether the increase in lung colonization after
chemotherapy treatment was due to an early event, we scored
the number of tumor cells in the lungs of mice 24 hours after
intravenous injection. To this end, mCherry-expressing C26
clones (C26-mCh) were generated by lentiviral transduction.
Puromycin selection yielded a clone that was highly ﬂuorescent (Supplementary Fig. S2A) with a proliferation rate comparable with the original cell line both in vitro (Supplementary
Fig. S2B) and in vivo, as determined by the number of lung
colonies 2 weeks after intravenous injection (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). Furthermore, mCherry expression was maintained in
lung colonies harvested 2 weeks after intravenous injection of
C26-mCh cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
To determine differences in the presence of mCherryexpressing tumor cells in the lungs 24 hours after tumor cell
injection, mice were pretreated with chemotherapy or vehicle
control, followed by intravenous injection of C26-mCh tumor
cells 4 days later. Twenty-four hours after tumor cell administration, mice were sacriﬁced and lungs were perfused, harvested, and sectioned. Interestingly, we observed that the
number of ﬂuorescent tumor cells in the lungs of chemotherapy-pretreated mice was signiﬁcantly enhanced as early as one
day after tumor cell injection (Fig. 2A and B). This implies that
chemotherapy pretreatment promotes early retention of
tumor cells in the lungs.
Chemotherapy enhances tumor cell adhesion to
endothelial cells in vitro
Because chemotherapy effects were observed at very early
stages of metastasis formation, we hypothesized that this was

www.aacrjournals.org

most likely due to enhanced tumor cell adhesion to endothelial
cells (EC). To test this hypothesis, in vitro adhesion assays were
done. Mouse bEND.3 EC monolayers were pretreated with
cisplatin and 4 days later, calcein-labeled tumor cells were
added and allowed to adhere. After 50 minutes, tumor cells
were taken off and the wells were washed 3 times, followed by
ﬂuorescent quantiﬁcation of adherent tumor cells. Remarkably, when ECs were not stimulated in vitro, tumor cells rapidly
detached in all conditions (data not shown). To exclude the
possibility that this was dependent on tumor cells requiring
integrins for adhesion, ECs were stimulated with PMA and
Mn2þ. Neither of these agents had any effect (data not shown).
Next, we primed the EC monolayer with TNFa or IL-1b, 2
cytokines that are known to circulate in response to cisplatin
therapy (9–11). Upon stimulation with either of these cytokines, a signiﬁcantly higher number of tumor cells remained
attached to the cisplatin-pretreated EC monolayer than to the
untreated EC monolayer (Fig. 2C). Pretreatment of bEND3
monolayers with paclitaxel showed enhanced tumor cell adhesion as well (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, similar results were found
when mouse primary lung ECs were pretreated with cisplatin
followed by adherence of C26 tumor cells (Fig. 2E).
TNFa or IL-1b is commonly used in static adhesion assays
because they enhance expression of adhesion proteins VCAM1 and ICAM-1 on ECs, 2 integrin ligands. To further investigate
the binding between tumor cells and ECs, we determined
whether CAM/integrin-mediated binding played a role in our
system. Addition of integrin-stimulating agent PMA to TNFastimulated endothelium did not further enhance adhesion of
tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Similar effects were
found for Mn2þ addition to TNFa (data not shown). Furthermore, when blocking integrin b1 or b3 on tumor cells before
addition onto TNFa-stimulated endothelium, adhesion of
tumor cells to vehicle-treated endothelium was decreased,
whereas adhesion to cisplatin-stimulated endothelium was
unchanged, indicating that these integrins are not important
for chemotherapy-induced adhesion (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Similar results were found when blocking ICAM-1 or VCAM-1
on the endothelium (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Together, these
experiments show that the chemotherapy-induced adhesion is
independent of integrins b1 and b3, and VCAM-1 and ICAM-1,
and a different binding mechanism plays a key role here.
Chemotherapy enhances VEGFR-1 expression on ECs
in vivo
To clarify the chemotherapy-induced changes in ECs, we
characterized several cell surface receptors on lung ECs after
chemotherapy treatment. Mouse lungs were harvested 4 days
after cisplatin administration (when we would usually inject
tumor cells) and single cell fractions were prepared for analysis
of various EC markers by FACS. ECs were characterized as
CD31highCD45neg cells. The number of activated vascular cell
adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)–expressing ECs was similar in
both groups (Fig. 3A). However, when studying expression of
VEGF-receptors, a signiﬁcant increase in VEGFR-1 expression
on lung ECs was found, whereas the percentage of VEGFR-2–
expressing ECs remained unchanged (Fig. 3A). VEGFR-1
expression was only increased in activated, VCAM-1–

expressing ECs (Fig. 3A), suggesting that VEGFR-1 is speciﬁcally upregulated in activated endothelial cells upon chemotherapy exposure. We conﬁrmed the enhanced VEGFR-1 in
pulmonary ECs of mice following exposure to chemotherapy by
conducting coimmunoﬂuorescence of CD31 and VEGFR-1.
Indeed, a larger percentage of CD31þ ECs coexpressed
VEGFR-1 in lungs obtained from mice that had been pretreated
with chemotherapy (Fig. 3B and C).
A different population of VEGFR-1–expressing cells, circulating VEGFR-1–expressing hematopoietic cells, has recently
been implicated in tumor growth and progression (12–15). To
exclude the possibility that we are in fact studying VEGFR-1–
expressing hematopoietic cells, control experiments were done
using pan-hematopoietic cell marker CD45. Pulmonary levels
of VEGFR-1–expressing hematopoietic cells remained
unchanged 4 days after chemotherapy (Fig. 3D). In addition,
no increases of VEGFR-1–expressing myeloid cells (VEGFR1þCD11bþ; Supplementary Fig. S4A), VEGFR-1–expressing
hematopoietic progenitor cells (VEGFR-1þCD45þCD117þ;
Supplementary Fig. S4B), and VEGFR-1–expressing hemangiocytes (15; VEGFR-1þCD45þCXCR4þ; Supplementary Fig.

(Supplementary Fig. S4D) nor hemangiocytes (Supplementary
Fig. S4E). Together, these experiments conﬁrm that VEGFR-1
upregulation indeed takes place in nonhematopoietic CD31high
VCAM-1þ ECs.
To determine whether VEGFR-1 upregulation on ECs is a
direct effect of cytotoxic agents, we incubated ECs with chemotherapy in vitro. To mimic the acute peak in drug concentration that mice experience in vivo, ECs were exposed to 3 or 5
mmol/L cisplatin for 4 hours. After washing-out of the chemotherapeutic drug, ECs were maintained in culture medium for 4
days, corresponding to the time point at which tumor cells
were injected in our in vivo experiments. Interestingly, a
signiﬁcant upregulation of VEGFR-1 on ECs was found by ﬂow
cytometry, which increased with ascending doses of cisplatin
(Fig. 3E). In contrast, VEGFR-2 expression on ECs was not
increased (data not shown).
Furthermore, we investigated whether the VEGFR-1
increase was found solely on pulmonary ECs by performing
ﬂow cytometry studies on single cell isolates from different
organs. In the lungs, we found that the VEGFR-1þ increase
was most profound on ECs expressing high levels of CD31.
Surprisingly, this population was much less abundant in the

Blocking VEGFR-1 prevents early retention of tumor cells
in the lungs and chemotherapy-induced metastases
To determine whether tumor cell retention in mouse lungs
following chemotherapy exposure could be attributed to
VEGFR-1 upregulation on ECs, we obtained neutralizing antibodies targeting mouse VEGFR-1 (Clone MF1, ImClone Systems Inc.). Because we speciﬁcally aimed to block host VEGFR1, we excluded direct effects of these antibodies on the tumor
cells. C26 proliferation in vitro was not inﬂuenced by the
addition of MF1 (Fig. 4A) and a single administration of MF1
one day before tumor cell injection in the absence of cisplatin
did not diminish the number of lung colonies after 13 days (Fig.
4D, left and third bar). These ﬁndings correspond to a recently
published study in which continuous MF1 treatment did not
change the number of C26 lung colonies after intravenous
injection (16).
To test whether MF1 would block early retention of tumor
cells in mouse lungs after chemotherapy exposure, we administered chemotherapy to BALB/c mice, followed by MF1 3 days
later. One day after MF1 injection, C26-mCh tumor cells were
injected intravenously. Cisplatin therapy was again found to
signiﬁcantly enhance the number of C26-mCh cells in the lungs
after 24 hours (Fig. 4B and C), while MF1 by itself did not
change the number of tumor cells present in the lungs.

However, addition of MF1 to cisplatin completely reversed
the chemotherapy-induced tumor cell retention (Fig. 4B,C). To
study whether the reduction of pulmonary tumor cell retention
at early time points corresponded to an inhibition of the
number of surface metastases at later time points, mice were
sacriﬁced 13 days after tumor cell injection. We found that MF1
by itself again did not reduce the number of surface metastases.
However, cotreatment of MF1 and chemotherapy was sufﬁcient to prevent the chemotherapy-induced metastases. Mice
treated with the combination therapy had as few surface
metastases as the untreated control mice (Fig. 4D). This was
successfully reproduced in C57Bl/6 mice injected intravenously with B16F10 tumor cells (data not shown), strengthening our
ﬁnding that VEGFR-1 blockade can speciﬁcally reduce the
chemotherapy-induced lung colonization by tumor cells.
Furthermore, we tested the speciﬁcity of VEGFR-1 in this
process. VEGFR-2 blocking antibodies (clone DC101, ImClone
Systems Inc.) were administered to mice and their effects on
chemotherapy-induced metastasis were determined. We
found that antibodies targeting VEGFR-2 did not block cisplatin-induced pulmonary metastasis in C57Bl/6 mice injected
intravenously with B16F10 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A),
whereas pulmonary metastasis were in fact blocked by in a
second model of BALB/c mice injected intravenously with C26
tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The variability of
VEGFR-2 effects across models suggests a direct effect of
VEGFR-2 on C26 tumor cells rather than a broad effect on

Chemotherapy-Induced Metastases

ECs. Indeed, DC101 therapy by itself—in contrast to MF1
therapy–-diminished the number of lung metastases in
BALB/C mice injected intravenously with C26 tumor cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5B), and C26 proliferation was diminished by DC101 in vitro as determined by MTT (Supplementary
Fig. S5C). In addition, in contrast to VEGFR-1, we did not ﬁnd
an increase in VEGFR-2 expression following chemotherapy
exposure of ECs in vivo (Fig. 3A) nor in vitro (data not shown).
Overall, we conclude that the endothelial cell response to
chemotherapy resulting in enhanced pulmonary metastases
is speciﬁc for VEGFR-1.

Discussion
In addition to the direct effects of chemotherapy on the
tumor, a host response is evoked that may interfere with
therapy beneﬁts (1–5). Our study stresses the relevance of this
host response. We here show that chemotherapy stimulated
tumor cell homing after intravenous injection, resulting in an
increased number of lung metastases. Chemotherapy exposure
elevated VEGFR-1 expression on endothelial cells. Administration of antibodies targeting VEGFR-1 prevented both arrest
of tumor cells in lungs and the formation of chemotherapyinduced pulmonary metastases.
In the early 1970s, irradiation of mouse lungs before intravenous injection of tumor cells was shown to enhance lung
colony formation (17). A few years later, similar effects were
observed after treatment with cyclophosphamide (18, 19). The
rise in the number of experimental pulmonary metastases was
shown to be dose-dependent and unrelated to blood clotting
after therapy. Subsequently, some preliminary mechanisms
have been suggested to participate in this phenomenon (20). In
1981, 2 articles by Hanna and colleagues showed a central
mechanistic role for NK cells in cyclophosphamide-induced
lung metastases (21, 22). However, our study shows that the
observed increase in C26 metastases after cisplatin pretreatment does not depend on components of the adaptive immune
system, because Rag2/;IL2Rgc/ mice display a similar
metastatic load as compared with immune competent mice.
Thus, it is plausible that distinct cytotoxic agents will induce
differential host effects.
Using the commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic drugs
cisplatin and paclitaxel, our studies now provide insight in
enhanced metastasis formation mediated by changes in
vascular ECs, more speciﬁcally by upregulation of VEGFR1. Nowadays, the endothelium is recognized as not simply
being an inert lining to vessels, but a highly specialized,
metabolically active interface between blood and underlying
tissues (23). Even though ECs are not very sensitive to
cytotoxic agents because they do not avidly divide, patients
frequently develop vascular complications, which may result
from damage to ECs (24). In this light, previous studies have
shown that VEGFR-1 upregulation in ECs occurred upon
mechanical denudation (25). Furthermore, when tumor cells
were exposed to cisplatin (or related compound oxaliplatin)
enhanced VEGFR-1 expression on their membranes was
observed, which was mediated by Akt, Src, or MAP kinase
signaling (26, 27). Further research will need to clarify

www.aacrjournals.org

whether the processes occurring in both cell types after
chemotherapy exposure are similar.
VEGFR-1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can bind VEGF-A,
VEGF-B, and PlGF. VEGFR-1 has a 10-fold higher afﬁnity for
VEGF than VEGFR-2, but it has a weak kinase activity (28, 29).
Even though much remains unknown regarding its functions,
VEGFR-1 has been implicated in metastasis formation. In
VEGFR-1TK/ mice, less metastases were observed than in
their wild-type littermates, whereas primary tumor growth was
not signiﬁcantly different (30). Moreover, VEGFR-1–expressing
hematopoietic progenitor cells have been shown to initiate a
premetastatic niche in mouse lungs, providing a permissive
environment for tumor cell colonization (12). In our models,
we neither detected mobilization of circulating VEGFR-1–
expressing hematopoietic (progenitor) cells into the circulation upon cisplatin administration, nor homing of these cells in
the lungs. Yet, chemotherapy created a distinctive niche in the
pulmonary endothelium, which is characterized by upregulation of VEGFR-1 on ECs and—similar to the premetastatic
niche—can be inhibited by blocking VEGFR-1. It will be very
interesting to determine whether the observed VEGFR-1
effects are due to inhibition of VEGFR-1 kinase signaling.
Therefore, combining chemotherapy with a speciﬁc VEGFR1 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) would be an
alternative approach. However, VEGFR-1–speciﬁc RTKIs are
not presently available, and multi-targeting RTKIs such as
sunitinib have antitumor effects in C26 and B16 tumor cells,
in our hands (unpublished results LD and EV) and in literature
(31–33). Furthermore, pretreatment with RTKIs has been
reported to enhance intravenous lung metastases (34), which
would further complicate these experiments.
Although the functional role of VEGFR-1 in the "chemotherapy-induced niche" remains to be determined, a direct adhesive role for VEGFR-1 seems unlikely. Indeed, we could not
block adhesion in vitro with antibodies directed at VEGFR-1
(data not shown). This could be due to limitations of the in vitro
setup, which obviously does not reﬂect the complexity of our in
vivo models. However, an indirect role for VEGFR-1 in adhesion
is feasible. Alternatively, and perhaps more importantly,
VEGFR-1 could also function in tumor cell survival, invasion,
or migration after chemotherapy. Previously, it was shown that
primary tumors can facilitate lung colony formation after
intravenous injection of tumor cells via upregulation of MMP9
in lung ECs, among other cells (30). The enhanced expression of
MMP9 was dependent on VEGFR-1 tyrosine kinase activity,
since it was not observed in VEGFR-1TK/ mice. Together,
MMP-9 and VEGFR-1 mediated tumor cell invasion into lung
tissues (30). Given the very potent in vivo effects of MF1 in
prevention of metastasis after chemotherapy, this mechanism
could contribute to the early retention of tumor cells observed
after chemotherapy exposure.
Our model highlights the speciﬁc host events that are evoked
by chemotherapy, regardless of the presence of a tumor. There
are several situations in which this mechanism may play a
clinically relevant role. First of all, all patients will experience
chemotherapy-mediated host effects. However, those patients
with tumors that are refractory to chemotherapy will most
likely suffer most from these effects which may lead to early

progression. Second, circulating tumor cells (CTC) can be
found in most patients. Chemotherapy-induced adaptation of
the microenvironment may facilitate retention of these cells in
distant organs, thereby diminishing the treatment outcome.
Similarly, during surgery the number of CTCs increases due to
manipulation of the tumor. Hence, neoadjuvant chemotherapy
may prime the microenvironment in such a way that these
circulating tumor cells have a higher chance of forming metastatic foci. In these, and perhaps other relevant clinical
situations, VEGFR-1 blockade could potentially lead to an
improved treatment outcome for patients.
In summary, we show that endothelial cell changes occurring upon chemotherapy exposure in mice can create an
environment favorable for metastasis formation through
expression of VEGFR-1. This study provides a novel rationale
for the addition of VEGFR-1 targeting agents to current
chemotherapy regimens.
