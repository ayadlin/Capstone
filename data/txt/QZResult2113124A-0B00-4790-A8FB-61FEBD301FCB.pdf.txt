BACKGROUND. Understanding the causes of failure in older patients with acute
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) may help improve treatment strategies for patients
in this particular age group.

METHODS. The objectives of the current study were to define the causes of death
in older patients (aged 60 years) with ALL during induction and consolidationmaintenance with a dose-intensive regimen of alternating 8 courses of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-

CVAD) with high doses of methotrexate and cytarabine followed by maintenance
with 6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, methotrexate, and prednisone and to compare their outcomes with the outcomes of older patients who received earlier,
less intensive regimens and younger patients who received hyper-CVAD. One
hundred twenty-two older patients who received hyper-CVAD were compared
with 34 older patients who received less intensive regimens and with 409 younger
patients who received hyper-CVAD.

RESULTS. The complete response (CR) rates in older patients receiving hyperCVAD, older patients receiving other regimens, and younger patients receiving
hyper-CVAD were 84%, 59%, and 92%, respectively (P < .001); and the respective
induction mortality rates were 10%, 12%, and 2% (P not significant in older
patients). The incidence of disease resistance during induction was 5%, 27%, and
2%, respectively (P < .001). The majority of deaths were related to infections.
Among patients who achieved a CR, death in CR was noted in 34%, 15%, and 7%
of older patients receiving hyper-CVAD, older patients receiving other regimens,
and younger patients, respectively (P < .001); and the respective rates of recurrence were 40%, 80%, and 48% (P 5 .004). The estimated 5-year survival rates
were 20%, 9%, and 48%, respectively (P < .001).

CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study suggested that intensifying the
chemotherapy in older patients with ALL reduced the incidence of leukemia
resistance but increased the incidence of death in CR from myelosuppressionassociated infections. The overall benefit:risk ratio was favorable. Identifying
novel, low-intensity agents/regimens for older patients with ALL may improve
the results further. Cancer 2008;113:2097–101.  2008 American Cancer Society.

90% in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).1-4 In adult
ALL, similarly designed regimens, albeit less dose-intensive with
some components (such as vincristine and asparaginase, because of
their poor tolerance by adults), result in CR rates of 80% to 90% and

long-term survival rates of 20% to 50%.5-10 Overall
results vary according to entry criteria and well
described prognostic factors. Programs that excluded
older patients (ages 50 years to 65 years), patients
with a poor performance status or organ dysfunctions, and patients with Philadelphia chromosome
(Ph)-positive ALL have reported better results11,12
compared with regimens that have more inclusive
eligibility.5
Elderly patients with ALL have a worse prognosis
than young patients when they receive the same
regimens.13-17 In such patients, the CR rates have
varied from 35% to 80%, but the long-term survival
rates are 5% to 15%.13-17 The definition of an elderly
patient varies but most commonly refers to ages 60
to 65 years. Defining the causes of failure in elderly
patients with ALL may help improve our therapeutic
strategies. For example, if the main cause of failure is
resistant disease, then novel agents with specific
acute-ALL activity in elderly patients would be
important. If treatment-associated mortality is predominant, then designing regimens that lower the
treatment dose intensity, without compromising
anti-ALL efficacy, might prove beneficial. Identifying
causes of failure in elderly patients with ALL was the
objective of the current analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All patients with a new diagnosis of ALL who were
referred to our institution from 1980 onward and
were treated on ALL regimens were reviewed. Elderly
patients were defined as patients aged 60 years. The
analysis focused on elderly patients who were treated
with the recently developed hyper-CVAD regimens.5
Hyper-CVAD refers to dose-intensive therapy that
alternates 8 total courses of fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone
(C-VAD) with high doses of methotrexate and cytarabine (HDMTX-ara-C) followed by maintenance with
6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, methotrexate, and
prednisone (POMP) for 18 to 30 months. The program
includes central nervous system prophylaxis with
intrathecal therapy, antibiotic prophylaxis, and granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor support. The components of the hyper-CVAD regimen and subsequent
modifications have been detailed previously. The analysis compared elderly versus younger patients on
hyper-CVAD (implemented since 1992) as well as previous regimens (VAD, C-VAD).18
Criteria for response were standard. A CR
required a bone marrow blast count 5% in cellular
bone marrow with normalization of peripheral blood
counts, including a granulocyte count 109/L and a

Study Group
In total, 122 elderly patients with ALL received
hyper-CVAD. These patients were compared with 34
elderly patients who received previous regimens and
409 younger patients who received hyper-CVAD. The
characteristics of the 3 groups are shown in Table 1.
Induction Therapy
The rates of CR, induction mortality, and resistant
disease with induction therapy are shown in Table 2.
Since 2000, elderly patients have received induction
therapy in a protected environment. Induction mortality was observed in 3 of 61 such patients (5%)
compared with in 9 of 61 elderly patients (15%) who
were treated previously outside the protected envi-

ronment on hyper-CVAD (P 5 .069) and 4 of 34
elderly patients (12%) who received other regimens
(P 5 .22). The incidence of resistant disease was 27%
with prehyper-CVAD regimens and 5% with hyperCVAD (P < .001). Among the 102 CRs that were
obtained with hyper-CVAD in elderly patients, 82
CRs (80%) were obtained after the first course, and
20 CRs (20%) were obtained after the second course
or subsequent courses.
Among 16 elderly patients who died during
induction, all deaths were related to infection (Table
3). Multiorgan failure associated with infections was
observed during the induction or by the time of
death in 14 of 16 patients.

Causes of Failure After Remission
Next, we focused on the causes of failure after remission induction, particularly the incidence and cause
of death in CR. The hypothesis was that elderly
patients would be more susceptible to death in CR
from the myelosuppression-associated complications
(infections, bleeding) of intensive chemotherapy. We
characterized the deaths in CR according to whether
they occurred during the hyper-CVAD or HDMTXara-C components of the 8 courses or during POMP
maintenance.
Among 102 elderly patients with ALL who
achieved a CR with hyper-CVAD, 76 patients (75%)
experienced subsequent treatment failure. The
causes of failure were death in CR in 35 patients and
recurrence in 41 patients. Among the 35 deaths in
CR, 22 deaths (63%) were caused predominantly by
infections, 1 death was caused by bleeding, and 4
deaths were from other causes (in 8 patients, the
cause of death was unknown). Seventeen of 35

deaths (20%) occurred during HDMTX-araC therapy,
10 deaths (29%) occurred during POMP maintenance, and 1 death occurred after allogeneic stem
cell transplantation (SCT) (Table 4). Most of the
deaths in elderly patients on hyper-CVAD occurred
during the 8 courses of dose-intensive chemotherapy.
Table 4 details the causes of death in CR. Two points
are important: 1) Younger patients tolerated consolidation-maintenance therapy better and had a lower
rate of mortality in CR (7%); and 2) as the treatment
intensity increased (prehyper-CVAD to hyper-CVAD),
the cause of failure post-CR changed in elderly
patients with ALL from disease recurrence (prehyperCVAD, 80%; hyper-CVAD, 40%) to myelosuppression-

related mortality in CR (prehyper-CVAD, 15%; hyperCVAD, 34%). Overall, the risk:benefit ratio of the
more intensive hyper-CVAD regimen was favorable,
because it translated into a modest but significant
survival improvement (Fig. 1). Among the 35 elderly
patients who died in CR, that event was preceded by
at least 1 serious or life-threatening infectious complication in a previous dose-intensive course in 28
patients (80%). The survival of elderly patients who
received hyper-CVAD is shown in Figure 1 and is
compared with elderly patients who were treated on
prehyper-CVAD regimens and with younger patients
who were treated with hyper-CVAD.

These were the cause of 34% of failures in CR among
elderly patients with ALL on hyper-CVAD, or 29% of
all failures on the regimens.
How can the outcome in elderly patients with
ALL be improved further? Reverting back to less
intensive regimens is an option that may result in
higher rates of recurrence and overall failure.
Because all patients received prophylactic antibiotics
and growth factor support, it is unlikely that changes
in supportive care will yield substantial improvement. The use of more dose-intense, nonmyelosuppressive agents also is associated with infections
(eg, steroids) or extramedullary complications (eg,
vincristine, asparaginase). More active and less toxic
versions of older agents (eg, liposomal vincristine,
pegylated asparaginase) may be 1 way to improve
outcomes. A study comparing liposomal vincristine
with vincristine as part of induction-consolidationmaintenance therapy in elderly patients with ALL is
under consideration. Newer agents with selective
anti-ALL activity may improve outcomes further in
ALL patient subsets. This may be the case for nelarabine in T-cell ALL19 and for imatinib and dasatinib in
Ph-positive ALL.20,21 In addition, monitoring for
minimal residual disease using sensitive techniques,
such as 4-color flow cytometry or polymerase chain
reaction analysis, may allow for the cessation of
therapy earlier in patients at high risk for
complications.22–26

DISCUSSION
This analysis indicated that, as ALL regimens have
become more dose-intensive, outcome in elderly
patients with ALL has improved, but the primary
cause of failure has changed from recurrence to
death in CR because of myelosuppression-associated
complications. Among elderly patients with ALL, the
CR rate with hyper-CVAD was 84%; the induction
mortality rate was 12% but was reduced to 5% with
the use of the protective environment. Similarly, the
5-year survival on hyper-CVAD regimen improved to
20% compared with 9% on regimens that were used
before hyper-CVAD (P 5 .046) (Fig. 1). Thus, although
dose-intensive regimens improved outcome even in
elderly patients with ALL, they shifted (unexpectedly)
the cause of failure to complications of therapy.
