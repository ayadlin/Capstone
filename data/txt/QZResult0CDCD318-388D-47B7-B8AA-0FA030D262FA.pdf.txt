Abstract
Unresectable metastatic bone sarcoma and soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are incurable due to the inability to
eradicate chemoresistant cancer stem–like cells (sCSC) that are likely responsible for relapses and drug
resistance. In this study, we investigated the preclinical activity of patient-derived cytokine-induced killer (CIK)
cells against autologous bone sarcoma and STS, including against putative sCSCs. Tumor killing was evaluated
both in vitro and within an immunodeﬁcient mouse model of autologous sarcoma. To identify putative sCSCs,
autologous bone sarcoma and STS cells were engineered with a CSC detector vector encoding eGFP under the
control of the human promoter for OCT4, a stem cell gene activated in putative sCSCs. Using CIK cells expanded
from 21 patients, we found that CIK cells efﬁciently killed allogeneic and autologous sarcoma cells in vitro.
Intravenous infusion of CIK cells delayed autologous tumor growth in immunodeﬁcient mice. Further in vivo
analyses established that CIK cells could inﬁltrate tumors and that tumor growth inhibition occurred without an
enrichment of sCSCs relative to control-treated animals. These results provide preclinical proof-of-concept for
an effective strategy to attack autologous sarcomas, including putative sCSCs, supporting the clinical development of CIK cells as a novel class of immunotherapy for use in settings of untreatable metastatic disease. Cancer

Introduction
Bone and soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous
group of mesenchymal tumors. Regardless their heterogeneity,
advanced, not surgically amenable, bone sarcoma and STS are
linked by a common dismal clinical prognosis (1–4).
Although new hope has been brought by molecular targeted therapies, results are still insufﬁcient. Indeed, metastatic and unresectable diseases remain incurable with less
than 10% of the patients alive after 5 years (3, 5). As new
approaches are urgently needed, adoptive immunotherapy is
considered a promising option to be explored (6–8). In this
scenario, reliable patient-speciﬁc preclinical models are
crucial to provide basis for an effective clinical translation
of this strategy.

Key and open issues faced by cancer immunotherapy
research models are (i) the possibility to dispose of autologous
tumor targets, (ii) expansion of "clinical relevant" numbers of
immune effectors, (iii) restrictions to speciﬁc human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) haplotypes when targeting tumor-associated
antigens (TAA), and (iv) the possibility to kill putative cancer
stem cells (CSC) considered responsible for tumor relapses and
chemoresistance. The frequent use of commercially available
allogeneic tumor cell lines is a useful tool to generate proof of
concept but cannot account for the individual biologic and
immunogenic variability properties of each patient and his/her
tumor. On the basis of these considerations, we set up a
preclinical HLA-unrestricted autologous immunotherapy
model for the treatment of bone sarcoma and STS, based on
cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, and dedicated speciﬁc
insights to the ability of such immunotherapy to kill putative
sarcoma CSCs (sCSC).
CIK cells are heterogeneous ex vivo expanded T lymphocytes
generated from peripheral blood precursors (9, 10). They
present a mixed T/NK phenotype and are endowed with
MHC-unrestricted antitumor activity (11). The great ex vivo
expansibility and the absence of speciﬁc MHC restrictions are
crucial characteristics that favor CIK cells over conventional
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (12–15).
CIK cells have been reported to exert high in vitro antitumor
activity against several solid tumor cell lines (14, 16–21), and
initial encouraging data were translated in recent clinical trials
(22–33). Tumor-killing activity of CIK cells is mainly mediated

by the interaction of their membrane receptor NKG2D with
stress-inducible molecules, MHC class I–related chain A and B
(MIC A/B) and UL-16–binding proteins (ULBPs), on target cells
(34, 35). The expression of MIC A/B and ULBPs has been
described in several epithelial tumors, but data on mesenchymal tumors of various histotype are missing (36–39). The
antitumor activity of CIK cells against autologous bone sarcoma and STS is currently not explored, nor is their ability to
kill putative sCSCs.
The phenotype and precise deﬁnition of CSCs is currently an
object of intense research and ﬁnal consensus has not been
reached (40–44). Besides the presence of various membrane
markers, alternatively associated with stemness features, peculiar genetic signatures have been reported to characterize
putative CSCs with the re-expression of stem-genes like
OCT3/4, NANOG, SOX typically activated within normal stem
cells (45–47). Recent experimental evidences conﬁrmed that
Oct4 expression able to induce dedifferentiation, stemness
phenotype, and tumor-initiating features in cancer cells,
including sarcomas (47, 48).
We developed a gene transfer strategy to visualize and
track putative sCSCs exploiting the selective ability of stem
cells to activate the stemness gene Oct4. In our study, we
report for the ﬁrst time the effective preclinical antitumor
activity of patient-derived CIK cells against autologous bone
sarcoma and STS of various histotype, including evidence of
killing putative sCSCs.

Materials and Methods
Ex vivo expansion and phenotype of CIK cells
CIK cells were expanded from peripheral blood collected
from patients with histologic conﬁrmed bone sarcoma and STS
at our Center. All individuals provided informed consent for
blood donation according to a protocol approved by the
internal review board and ethic committee.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated by density gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep, Sentinel Diagnostic) and seeded in cell culture ﬂasks at a
concentration of 1.5  106 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 medium
(Gibco BRL), consisting of 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin (Gibco BRL). IFN-g
(PeproTech; 1,000 U/mL) was added on day 0, after 24 hours
of interleukin (IL)-2 (Proleukin, Aldesleukin, Chiron Corporation) and anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3, Pharmingen) were
added at a concentration of 300 U/mL and 50 ng/mL,
respectively. Cells were expanded over 3 weeks of time
period. Fresh medium and IL-2 (300 U/mL) were added
weekly (every 3 days) during culture, and the cell concentration was maintained at 1.5  106 cells/mL. Phenotype of
CIK cells was weekly analyzed by standard ﬂow cytometric
assays. The following monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were
used: CD3–FITC, CD4–PE, CD56–APC, CD8—PE, and
CD314–APC (anti-NKG2D) (mAbs were Miltenyi Biotec).
The projected dose of CIK cells/kg for each patient was
obtained assuming a theoretic basal collection of 3  108
mononuclear cells per patient according to the formula: (3 
108  observed fold increase)/kg of body weight.

Primary cell cultures of bone sarcoma and STS
Human tumor samples were obtained from surgical specimens; patients provided consent under institutional review
board–approved protocols and investigations were conducted
after approval by a local Human Investigations Committee.
Approximately 10 mm3 of each tissue sample was mechanically
dissociated with surgical blade, digested in collagenase I (200
U/mL, Invitrogen), and incubated for 3 hours at 37 C. At the
end of this ﬁrst step of digestion, single-cell suspension was
recovered and seeded in culture both in attachment and
ultralow attachment. The debris were submitted to an additional collagenase I digestion at 37 C overnight. At the end of
enzymatic digestion, single-cell suspension was recovered.
Finally, cells were resuspended in KO DMEM F12 (KO Out
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium, Gibco BRL) medium
with 10% FBS and plated at clonal density (105 cells per
cm2) in 6-well plates (Corning). An additional aliquot of cells
were seeded at 10,000 cells per cm2 in ultralow attachment 24well plates (Corning) in KO DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS.
Cell aliquots were stained with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), PE–Cyanin 7 (PC7), or allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated mouse mAbs against HLA-ABC (antiHLA-ABC-FITC, BD Pharmingen) and CIK target antigens (antiMIC A/B, BD Pharmingen; anti-ULBPs, R&D System, Space
Import Export). Intracellular expression of Oct4 was detected
after ﬁxation/permeabilization by the Cyoperm/Cytoﬁx Kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences
Pharmingen). ALDH activity was evaluated by ALDEFLUOR
assay kit (Aldagen, Stemcell Technologies), according to manufacturer's instructions. Stro-1 expression was detected by ﬂow
cytometric staining tumor cells with APC-conjugated anti-Stro1 monoclonal antibody (Biolegend). Labeled cells were read on a
FACS Cyan (Cyan ADP, Dako) and analyzed using Summit
Software. Gate criteria were set according to isotype controls.
For histology analysis, mesenchymal primary cell cultures
were washed in PBS 1 and cytospins were prepared onto
slides (100,000 cells per slide in 100 mL of PBS 1) at 1,500 rpm
for 5 minutes using a Shandon Cytocentrifuge Cytospin 2.
Following air drying, slides were ﬁxed in methanol for 30
minutes. Cytospins were stained using May Grunwald–Giemsa
stain (Merk) stained for 5 minutes in May-Grunwald and 20
minutes in Giemsa.
Allogeneic tumor cell lines
All cell lines [MNNG-HOS and Sjsa 1 osteosarcoma cell lines
and MES-SA leiomyosarcoma cell lines, American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC)] used in this study were grown in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 25 mmol/L HEPES,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin (Gibco BRL)
in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator at 37 C. To authenticate
sarcoma cell lines, genotype analysis of MNNG-HOS, Sjsa 1, and
MESS-SA cell lines was conducted and conﬁrmed by Cell_ID
system (Promega) comparing their proﬁle with those published on the DMSZ database.
Cell aliquots were stained with FITC, PE, PC7, or APCconjugated mouse mAbs against CIK-target antigens (antiMIC A/B, BD Pharmingen; anti-ULBPs, R&D System, Space
Import Export).

CIKs Kill Autologous Sarcomas and Putative Cancer Stem Cells

In vivo tumorigenesis of patient-derived primary cell
cultures
Non-obese diabetic/LtSz-scid/scid (NOD/SCID; Charles River) female mice were subcutaneously injected with 1  106
primary bone sarcoma and STS cells (n ¼ 5), resuspended in
sterile PBS and BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix
(Becton Dickinson) 1:1. Mice were housed in ﬁltered cages
under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions and permitted unlimited access to food and water. Tumor growth was monitored
weekly with a caliper, and the volume was calculated using
the following formula V ¼ 4/3  p  (a/2)2  (b/2), where a is
the length and b is the width diameter of the tumor. When the
tumor reached 2 cm in the main diameter, the animal was
euthanized and the tumor was recovered and ﬁxed overnight in
4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, parafﬁn-embedded, sectioned (5 mm), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E.;
Bio Optica).
Generation of hOct4.eGFP lentiviral vector and tumor
cell transduction
VSV-G pseudotyped third-generation lentiviral vectors were
produced by transient 4-plasmid co-transfection into 293T
cells as described (Follenzi 2000). The transfer vector pRRL.
sin.PPT.hPGK.EGFP.Wpre (LV-PGK.EGFP) was kindly provided by Dr Elisa Vigna and described elsewhere (49).
The phOct4.EGFP1 vector (50) was kindly provided by Wei
Cui (IRDB, Imperial College London). The pRRL.sin.PPT.hOct4.
eGFP.Wpre (LV-Oct4.eGFP) was obtained by replacing the
expression cassette hPGK.eGFP into LV-PGK.eGFP with the
hOct4-eGFP1, cleaved from phOct4-eGFP1 vector, by insertion
into SalI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites.
Physical titers for lentiviral vector stocks were determined
on the basis of p24 antigen content (HIV-1 p24 ELISA kit;
PerkinElmer).
For each lentiviral vector transduction, bone sarcoma and
STS primary cells were resuspended in fresh medium with 10%
FBS. Virus-conditioned medium was added at dose of 400 ng
P24/100,000 cells. After 16 hours, cells were washed twice and
grown for at least 10 days before ﬂow cytometric analysis to
reach steady-state eGFP expression and to rule out pseudotransduction. As transduction efﬁciency control the same,
primary tumor cells were transduced with LV-PGK.eGFP.
Murine embryonic cells and PBMCs were transduced with
LV-Oct4.eGFP as positive and negative expression control.
In vitro proliferation assay
To evaluate the proliferation rate of eGFPþ versus eGFP
fractions, cells were labeled with lipophylic dye PKH26 according to manufacturer's instructions (PKH26GL kit, Sigma).
Baseline ﬂuorescence level was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
Labeled cells were seeded in culture, and after 7 and 14 days,
reduction in ﬂuorescence intensity was quantiﬁed by ﬂow
cytometry.
Analysis of LV-Oct4.eGFP in both eGFP-positive and
-negative cell fractions
Detection of LV-Oct4.eGFP in freshly sorted cells was veriﬁed by a PCR-based ampliﬁcation of the expression cassette

www.aacrjournals.org

Oct4.eGFP. gDNA was extracted separately from eGFPþ and
eGFP cells using a commercial kit (Qiagen). PCR reaction was
conducted using 100 ng of gDNA for each sample and Phusion
High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientiﬁc) according
to the manufacturer's protocol.
The following primers, annealing on the lentiviral vector
backbone sequences upstream and downstream the expression cassette, were used: lentiviral vector forward primer 50 aggcccgaaggaatagaaga-30 ; lentiviral vector reverse primer, 50 ccacatagcgtaaaaggagca-30 .
The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1%
agarose gel.
Cytotoxic activity of patient-derived CIK cells
The tumor-killing ability of patient-derived CIK cells was
assessed in vitro against primary bone sarcoma and STS cells
obtained from patient tumor samples, whenever available, or
against allogeneic tumor cell lines (Sjsa 1, MNNG HOS, MESSA) obtained from ATCC.
Target cells were stained with PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell
Linker kit (Sigma) or with the vital dye CFSE (5,6-carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester; Molecular Probes) in
accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The immunemediated killing was determined evaluating cell viability by
ﬂow cytometry (Cyan ADP, Dako), after 6-hour incubation with
expanded CIK cells at various effectors/target ratios (40:1, 20:1,
10:1, and 5:1 for 6 hours in 200 mL of culture medium with 300
U/mL IL2 at 37 C, 5% CO2), according to the formula: experimental  spontaneous mortality/(100  spontaneous mortality)  100. Killing against sCSCs was similarly evaluated
against primary tumor target cells preventively engineered
with LV-Oct4.eGFP to visualize putative sCSC. Cytotoxicity
was selectively calculated evaluating the decrease of viable
eGFPþ target cells, following the addition of CIK cells, compared with untreated controls. In selected experiments, we preincubated CIK cells with 20 mg/mL of inhibitory anti-NKG2D
neutralizing antibody (Clone #149810, R&D Systems) that was
maintained during the cytotoxicity assay against autologous
targets.
In vivo activity of patient-derived CIK cells
NOD/SCID (Charles River) female mice were subcutaneously injected with 106 primary cells of patient-derived pleomorphic sarcoma, resuspended in sterile PBS and BD Matrigel
Basement Membrane Matrix (Becton Dickinson) 1:1. Starting 4
days after tumor implantation, mice received 9 weekly intravenous infusions with 1  107 mature autologous CIK cells
resuspended in PBS (200 mL). Mice injected with PBS only were
used as control. Tumor growth was weekly monitored with a
caliper and volume calculated according to the formula: V ¼
4/3  p  (a/2)2  (b/2), where a is the length and b is the width
diameter of the tumor. Animals were euthanized when tumor
reached 2 cm in the main diameter. Recovered tumor was ﬁxed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, parafﬁnembedded, sectioned (5 mm), and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E; Bio.Optica). Immunohistochemical assay was
conducted with human anti-CD5 antibody. Animal experiments were approved by internal review board.

Evaluation of Ki-67 expression was conducted on all 12
tumor samples explanted from treated and untreated mice.
Tumor slides were incubated with monoclonal mouse antihuman Ki-67 (Dako, Agilent Technologies Company; 1:100)
overnight at 4 C. After washings in TBS, anti-mouse secondary
antibody (Dako Envision þ System-horseradish peroxidase–
labeled polymer, Dako) was added for 1 hour. Immunoreactivities were revealed by DAB chromogen (Dako Cytomation
Liquid DAB Substrate Chromogen System, Dako).
To evaluate the in vivo activity of CIK cells against autologous putative sCSCs, we transduced sarcoma cells derived
from all 12 explanted tumors, cryopreserved at the end of the
experiment described above, with the CSC detector vector LVOCT4.eGFP. Lentiviral transduction was conducted in parallel
in all samples from treated and control mice with the same
modalities described above. The percentage of residual eGFPþ
putative sCSC was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry 7 days after
transduction.
Statistical analysis
As descriptive statistical analysis, medians and ranges, mean
 SEM were used as appropriate. The mixed model ANOVA was
used to compare antitumor activity curves in vitro and in vivo.
Mean eGFP values and Ki-67 expression between tumors from
treated and untreated mice were compared by unpaired t test.
Mean tumor-speciﬁc lysis of CIK cells with and without neutralizing anti-NKG2D was compared by paired t test.
Statistical signiﬁcance has been expressed as true P value. All
P <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical
analysis was conducted using the software GraphPad Prism 5.

Results
Expansion and phenotype of CIK cells
We evaluated the ex vivo expansion of CIK cells from 21
patients with a diagnosis of advanced or metastatic bone
sarcoma or STS [osteosarcoma, n ¼ 7; leiomyosarcoma, n ¼
2; rhabdomyosarcoma, n ¼ 2; liposarcoma, n ¼ 2; gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), n ¼ 2; undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, n ¼ 6]. CIK cells were expanded from fresh
or cryopreserved PBMCs cultured with the timed addition of
IFN-g, Ab-anti-CD3, and IL-2. CIK cells were successfully
expanded from all patients within 4 weeks of culture; the
median expansion of bulk CIK cells, calculated on the total
CD3þ fraction, was 52-fold (range, 3–924), whereas 179-fold
expansion (18–3968) was obtained for the CD3þCD56þ cell
fraction. The presence of pure NK (CD3CD56þ) cells was
negligible, median 0.74% (0.1%–3%) at the end of the expansion. The subset of mature CIK cells co-expressing CD3 and
CD56 molecules (CD3þCD56þ) was present with a median of
35% (range, 15–90) whereas 78% (40%–99%) of total bulk CIK
cells were CD8þ. The median membrane expression of the
NKG2D receptor, main responsible for tumor recognition, on
expanded CIK cells was 89% (55%–97%). To simulate a real
clinical scenario, we evaluated the theoric dose of CIK cells/Kg
that our patients would realistically receive, based on their
individual ex vivo expansion rate. Considering a realistic but
conservative dose of 3  108 PBMCs collected at day 0, the
average dose per patient at the end of the ex vivo expansion

122

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

would have been of 4.24  108 CIK cells/kg (SEM: 1.9  108).
This dose of CIK cells is compatible with values so far adopted
in phase I and II clinical studies with CIK cells (31).
A summary of patients' characteristics and relative CIK
expansion data is reported in Table 1.
Patient-derived primary cell cultures of bone sarcoma
and STS
In 8 cases, we successfully generated primary tumor cell
cultures (osteosarcoma, n ¼ 2; liposarcoma, n ¼ 1; undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, n ¼ 3; GIST, n ¼ 1;
leiomyosarcoma, n ¼ 1) from sample biopsies of metastatic
(n ¼ 5) or primitive tumor (n ¼ 3) sites that served as targets
to assess the antitumor activity of autologous CIK cells. All
cell cultures displayed morphologic features consistent with
the corresponding original tumors as conﬁrmed by pathologic evaluation. A representative picture of primary tumor
cell cultures is shown in Fig. 1A–F. MIC A/B, main known
ligands recognized by CIK cells, were highly expressed only
on osteosarcoma cells whereas less present or practically
absent on STS. Analysis for ULBPs 1, 2, and 3 displayed
ubiquitous and predominant expression of ULBP2 compared
with all the other molecules (P < 0.05). Overall, the median
expression of MIC A/B was 38% (range, 3%–99%), whereas
median values for ULBPs 1, 2, and 3 were 1% (0%–10%), 97%
(31%–99%), and 8% (0%–77%), respectively. Detailed expression values of MIC A/B and ULBPs for each histotype are
reported in Table 1.
All tumor cell cultures were conﬁrmed to retain the
expression of HLA class-I.
Primary metastatic bone sarcoma and STS cells from in vitro
cultures were proved able to generate tumor xenografts when
inoculated subcutaneously into immunocompromised (NOD/
SCID) mice (n ¼ 5). Tumor xenografts developed within 3 to 6
weeks, displaying morphologic and architectural features typical of the original tumor as conﬁrmed by pathologic review.
For example, in the xenograft derived from metastatic osteosarcoma cells, the production of abundant osteoid matrix was
observed as typical feature of this histology. A representative
picture of primary tumor cell cultures and osteosarcoma
xenograft is shown in Fig. 1G.
In vitro and in vivo tumor-killing activity of CIK cells
against bone sarcoma and STS cells
To test the antitumor activity of CIK cells expanded from all
our patients, we started evaluating their ability to kill in vitro
allogeneic bone sarcoma and STS cell lines (MNNG-HOS; SJSA
1; MES-SA). The cytotoxicity test was conducted at the end of
the ex vivo expansion and showed an efﬁcient killing even if
variable among patients. The mean speciﬁc tumor killing was
81% 76%, 61%, and 44% at 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1 effector/target
ratio, respectively (n ¼ 24, Fig. 2).
Next, we assessed the ability of patient-derived CIK cells to
kill autologous targets from all the 8 primary tumor cell
cultures. Results showed mean speciﬁc killing of 83%, 79%,
74%, and 62% at a 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1 effector/target ratio,
respectively (n ¼ 15). The intensity of killing against autologous
targets was comparable among different histotype and was not

of anti-NKG2D neutralizing antibody (20 mg/mL) partially

(P ¼ 0.003), compared with controls (Fig. 3).
To more closely simulate the real clinical situation, we tested
the activity of patient-derived CIK cells in vivo against autologous tumor xenografts in NOD/SCID mice.
Mice were implanted with primary cells of metastatic pleomorphic sarcoma and received 9 weekly intravenous infusions
of mature autologous CIK cells (107 per week). A signiﬁcant
reduction of tumor growth was observed in treated mice (n ¼
6) compared with untreated controls (n ¼ 6) P ¼ 0.017, mean
volumes at the end of experiment were in treated mice 807
mm3 (SEM, 138) versus 1,702 mm3 (SEM, 441) of controls (P <
0.0001, Fig. 4A). Evaluation of residual proliferative index, by Ki67 analysis, on residual tumor samples explanted at the end of
the experiment revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in treated mice
compared with controls (mean, 4.5; SEM, 1.2 vs. 9.3; SEM, 0.5;
P ¼ 0.009, Fig. 4B). These last data are consistent with recent
observation from immunotherapy clinical trials, requiring
additional metabolic or histologic data beyond the conven-

to evaluate clinical responses.
At the end of the experiment, we conﬁrmed the presence of
CIK cells inﬁltrating the autologous tumor (Fig. 4C).
CIK cells effectively kill putative sarcoma cancer stem
cells
To identify putative sCSCs, we transduced bulk primary
bone sarcoma and STS cells with a "CSC detector" made by a
lentiviral vector encoding the eGFP regulated by the human
Oct4 promoter (Fig. 5A). The underlying idea is that sCSCs
can be visualized on the basis of their exclusive ability,
property of both normal and cancer stem cells, to activate
the Oct4 promoter and consequently express eGFP. The
average presence of eGFPþ putative sCSC, within the bulk
metastatic cell assessed 7 days after transduction, was 14.3%
(SEM, 2.5; n ¼ 7; Fig. 5B); data were consistent with mean
levels of Oct4 protein expression (8.2%; SEM, 4.2). As other
putative stemness markers, we observed 4% (SEM, 1) average
expression of Stro-1 and 8.4% (SEM, 1) of ALDH activity;
representative plots of Oct4, Stro-1, and ALDH activity are
reported in Fig. 5C. As positive control, a murine embryonic
cell line expressing Oct4 (mES) was successfully transduced
with LV-Oct4-eGFP up to 90.5%, whereas no eGFP expression

Discussion
Our study reports for the ﬁrst time the intense preclinical
activity of CIK cells against autologous metastatic bone sarcoma and STS, including killing of putative sCSCs. All our data
are generated within a patient-speciﬁc autologous model, with
the intent to account for the intrinsic biologic variability
property of each tumor and single patient.
Overall the study reﬂects the potentialities of this adoptive
immunotherapy strategy, providing elements to discuss the realistic prospective and limitations of future clinical applications.
In our work, CIK cells were efﬁciently ex vivo expanded
directly from PBMCs of patients with various histotype of bone
sarcoma and STS. Previous or even concomitant conventional
chemotherapy treatments did not affect the expansion rates,
phenotype or functionality of CIK cells; values were consistent
and comparable with those previously published by our and
other groups (10, 14, 31). Simulating a projected dose of CIK
cells/kg for each of our patients, calculated on our experimental data, we obtained average values compatible with those so
far used in clinical trials (31). Furthermore, the simplicity and
relative cost effectiveness of the procedure would allow
patients with lower expansion rates to undergo repeated blood
collections for multiple ex vivo expansion cycles. Recent clin-

ical trials are supporting the potential of CIK cells in the
treatment of advanced solid tumors; however, data of activity
against bone sarcoma and STS are missing.
In general, preclinical studies have a key role in providing
reliable biologic basis for clinical applications. The complex
interaction between immune effectors and tumor cells is
regulated by biologic and immunologic elements, partially
unknown, that are speciﬁc and unique for each patient. A ﬁrst
report from Kuci and colleagues nicely provided evidences of
CIK cells activity against rhabdomyosarcoma (20). In that
work, allogeneic cell lines were used as targets. We provided
activity data within a new-generation, patient-speciﬁc model
where patient-derived CIK cells intensely killed autologous
metastatic tumor cells. The killing was not different among
various histotype of bone sarcoma and STS.
Furthermore, we posed a dedicated and innovative question
whether CIK cells might be able to kill a peculiar subset of
putative sCSCs. To this aim, we developed a new methodology
to visualize putative sCSCs based on a lentiviral "CSC detector"
vector encoding the eGFP protein controlled by the promoter
of stem gene Oct4. With this strategy, we visualized a small
fraction of putative sCSCs, endowed with a low-proliferating
phenotype and could provide a formal demonstration of killing
by autologous CIK cells in vitro. Within our in vivo model, we
did not detect sCSC enrichment in tumor samples explanted
from treated mice compared with untreated controls suggesting that in vivo activity of CIK cells is capable to involve putative
sCSCs. We observed a reduction of eGFPþ sCSCs in treated
mice compared with controls; however, while encouraging, the
experimental design and small size impose caution before

CIKs Kill Autologous Sarcomas and Putative Cancer Stem Cells

on the rationale that CSC are implicated in tumor relapse and
drug resistance. Their potential targeting should now since be
considered when evaluating the power of a given experimental
antitumor strategy.
A general issue to improve the quality of preclinical models
is the choice of targets that could be as representative as
possible of real clinical situations. Metastases may display
important biologic and immunogenic differences compared
with the primitive tumors. In the hypothesis of a clinical
application of CIK cells, patients will certainly have advanced
metastatic diseases and our model, based on targets that
mainly included metastatic samples, may provide additional
valuable information in this perspective.
The membrane expression of main ligands recognized by
CIK cells have not been yet fully described on metastatic
mesenchymal tumors. MIC A/B molecules have been reported
to be present in almost all types of epithelial tumors, we
observed minimal values in STS and only osteosarcoma cells
displayed high expression of these molecules.
Interestingly, all types of STS expressed very high levels of
ULBP2, justifying, at least in part, the intense killing by CIK
cells. MIC A/B and ULBPs are the main, but not exclusive,
ligands recognized by CIK cells; other molecules may be
implicated, accounting at various levels for the observed
tumoricidal effect. This could explain the signiﬁcant reduction
but not abrogation of cytotoxicity observed blocking the
NKG2D receptor on CIK cells in our study. It was not the aim
of this study to investigate in detail the mechanisms underlying
the tumoricidal effect of CIK cells; the issue is however of
potential clinical relevance deserving dedicated investigations,
a more complete deﬁnition of all tumor ligands, their setting
of expression and different role in mediating the cytotoxicity
of CIK cells may help the identiﬁcation of subsets of patients
that could better beneﬁt from CIK-based immunotherapy
approaches.
The activity of patient-derived CIK cells was conﬁrmed in
vivo against autologous STS xenografts, displaying the ability of
CIK cells to localize at tumor site. The reported curves of tumor
growth may however appear somehow discouraging, without a
real tumor regression, and raise concerns about the real
efﬁcacy of clinical applications of this approach. To this regard,
at least 2 considerations may be done. First, initial clinical trials
with immunotherapy strategies showed that dimensional
parameters, like RECIST, may not be the optimal method to
appreciate clinical responses and exploration of additional
metabolic and/or histologic criteria are warranted and under
investigation. Supporting this evidence, we observed a significant reduction of Ki6-7 expression in tumor samples from
treated mice compared with untreated controls. Second, our
preclinical model is representative of a bulky disease, a realistic
clinical setting for many experimental trials but not the most
suitable to detect the real efﬁcacy of immunotherapy strategies. Treatments in limited stages or even without evident
disease (e.g., adjuvant treatments after surgical resection)
would reasonably give the best results, and future trials,
including those with CIK cells, as well experimental models
should evolve in such direction. The decision to conduct 9
adoptive infusions was only based on the availability of patient-

www.aacrjournals.org

derived CIK cells that limited the set up of dose–response
curves. In clinical prospective, considering CIK cell's safety
proﬁle, it seems reasonable that multiple infusions should be
pursued to provide a better effect. We acknowledge that the
experimental size may appear limited. Using autologous biologic samples, we had to respect a limited size imposed by the
restrict quantity of blood donated upfront from patients who
were no more available over time for further blood withdrawals. Endpoints related to in vivo safety, kinetic, and tumor
trafﬁcking of CIK cells conﬁrm what is already shown by other
groups but it is the ﬁrst report within an autologous tumor
setting.
In the composite scenario of cancer immunotherapy, many
strategies are potentially of interest and to be explored;
however, patient-speciﬁc preclinical models are utmost necessary to orient the clinical translation. We believe that CIK
cells showed reliable activity against challenging and currently incurable mesenchymal tumors, including killing a
subset of putative sCSC with clinical relevant implications.
In vivo data highlight the need to explore the efﬁcacy of
adoptive immunotherapy approaches outside contests of
bulk diseases.
These data support further scientiﬁc investigations and
picture CIK cells as promising candidates for immunotherapy
clinical trials, especially considering settings with limited or
surgically resected metastatic disease.
