BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and neuroblastoma v-ras oncogene
homolog (NRAS) mutations in melanoma provides a strong rationale to test the clinical efficacy of mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase (MEK) inhibition in this disease. The authors hypothesized that the presence of BRAF or NRAS mutations would correlate with
clinical benefit among patients who received treatment with combination regimens that included the MEK inhibitor selumetinib.
METHODS: BRAF and NRAS mutation status was determined retrospectively in available tissue specimens from patients with melanoma who were enrolled in a phase 1 trial of selumetinib in combination with 1 of 4 drugs (dacarbazine, docetaxel, temsirolimus, or
erlotinib). The clinical response rate and the time to progression (TTP) were assessed as a function of BRAF and NRAS mutation status. RESULTS: Among 18 patients analyzed, 9 patients (50%) harbored a BRAF mutation (8 had a valine-to-glutamic acid substitution
at residue 600 [V600E]; 1 had an arginine nonsense mutation at residue 603 [R603]), 4 patients (22%) harbored an NRAS mutation
(2 had a glutamine-to-arginine substitution at residue 61 [Q61R], 1 had a glutamine-to-lysine substitution at residue 61 [Q61K], and 1
had a glycine-to-lysine substitution at residue 12 [G12S]), and 5 patient (28%) had the wild type of both genes. These mutations were
mutually exclusive. Among the 9 patients who had BRAF mutations, 5 patients (56%) achieved a partial response, and 4 patients
(44%) achieved stable disease for at least 6 weeks. No patient with the wild-type BRAF gene achieved a clinical response (P ¼ .01 vs
patients with BRAF mutations). The presence of an NRAS mutation did not correlate with the clinical response rate. The presence of a
BRAF mutation was correlated significantly with the TTP in a multivariate model (hazard ratio, 0.22; P ¼ .02 vs wild-type BRAF).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher response rates and longer TTP were observed with selumetinib-containing regimens in patients who had

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. In 2011, an estimated 166,000 new cases will be diagnosed in developed countries.1 The median survival of patients with stage IV melanoma is only 6 to 8 months. This is largely because of
the chemoresistance of the disease. US Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for metastatic melanoma include
dacarbazine, interleukin-2, and ipilimumab, which provide response rates in the range from 7% to 15%.2-4 Vemurafenib,
a selective RAF (proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein) inhibitor, recently was approved for the treatment of patients
who have melanoma with the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) valine-to-glutamic acid substitution at residue 600 (V600E) mutation because of its clinically significant survival benefit. The median progression-free
survival for these patients is only approximately 6 months, however, and the majority of patients ultimately have disease
progression within 1 year after starting treatment.5-7
Genetic sequencing reveals that the majority of melanomas harbor activating mutations in genes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.8 The most common mutation, which occurs in approximately 50% of cutaneous
melanomas, results in an amino acid change in the BRAF gene at codon 600. This point mutation leads to a change in
amino acid from valine to glutamic acid, less often to lysine, and occasionally to aspartic acid, and results in constitutive
activation of BRAF kinase activity.9,10 Another 15% to 20% of melanomas have a mutation in neuroblastoma v-ras

oncogene homolog (NRAS), which is upstream of BRAF
in the MAPK signaling pathway. For the most part, these
2 gene mutations are mutually exclusive.9 These findings
have generated much interest in targeting the MAPK
pathway, by inhibiting either BRAF or downstream
MAPK kinase (MEK). Pharmacologic RAS (rat sarcoma)
inhibition has proved unsuccessful to date.
Selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-142886) is an oral,
selective MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor that does not compete with adenosine triphosphate for binding to the MEK
proteins. In preclinical testing at concentrations up to 10
lM/L, this agent was exquisitely selective for MEK protein and did not significantly inhibit up to 40 other kinases.11 Moreover, in studies of cell lines from melanoma,
colon cancer, and nonsmall cell lung cancer, those lines
that harbored a RAS or RAF mutation appeared to be
more sensitive to selumetinib than cell lines that were wild
type for these genes.12 Subsequently, selumetinib (hydrogen-sulfate formulation) was evaluated in a phase 1 trial in
which it reportedly was well tolerated at a dose of 75 mg
twice daily (the phase 2 recommended dose).13
In vitro studies have demonstrated synergistic or
additive activity for selumetinib in combination with various cytotoxic or molecularly targeted drugs. In a v-Ki-ras2
Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-mutant colorectal cancer cell line, selumetinib plus irinotecan
reportedly was additive, whereas the combination of selumetinib plus docetaxel was synergistic.12 Haass and colleagues similarly demonstrated that the combination of
selumetinib and docetaxel produced synergistic growth
inhibition and apoptosis induction in a BRAF V600Emutant melanoma xenograft model.14
On the basis of the promising preclinical activity of
selumetinib-containing combination regimens for various
tumor types, including melanoma, a phase 1 study of selumetinib in combination with 1 of 4 different drugs (dacarbazine, docetaxel, erlotinib, or temsirolimus) in patients
with advanced solid tumors was conducted (National
Clinical Trial NCT00600496). We used available tumor
samples from patients who were enrolled in that trial to
test the hypothesis that the presence of activating BRAF
and NRAS mutations correlates with clinical benefit from
these selumetinib-containing combination regimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
An open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study (National Clinical Trial NCT00600496) was conducted to evaluate the
safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of twice-daily,
oral doses of selumetinib in combination with dacarbazine, docetaxel, erlotinib, or temsirolimus. The protocol
800

for this trial was approved by the institutional review
boards of each participating center in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written
informed consent before enrollment.
Patient Selection

Eligible patients were aged 18 years who had refractory
solid tumors and a World Health Organization (WHO)
performance status of 0 or 1. Among all participating
patients in this phase 1 study, we selected only patients
who had metastatic melanoma for our retrospective
genomic analysis. These patients had stage IV or unresectable stage III disease with at least 1 measurable lesion as
defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) version 1.0. Patients had to have adequate
organ and bone marrow function. Patients with brain metastases or spinal cord compression were excluded from
the study unless they had received treatment and were stable for at least 1 month and were off glucocorticoids by
the time of enrollment.
Treatment Plan

Two dose levels of selumetinib were explored in a 3 þ 3
escalation design. Patients received oral selumetinib at a
starting dose of 50 mg twice daily, continuously, with
dose escalation to 75 mg twice daily after 3 to 6 patients in
the previous cohort tolerated the starting dose. Selumetinib was combined with intravenous dacarbazine 1000
mg/m2 on day 1, intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day
1, oral erlotinib 100 mg daily, or intravenous temsirolimus 25 mg weekly. A treatment cycle was defined as 3
weeks. The choice of the combination was at the discretion of the local investigator.
Response Evaluation

Radiologic assessment of tumor(s) was performed every 2
cycles. All patients who received at least 1 dose of the
study drugs were considered evaluable for response. Clinical responses were defined according to RECIST version
1.0. The time to progression (TTP) was measured from
the start of treatment to the time of documented progressive disease.
Mutation Analysis

DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples that had been verified by a pathologist
for the presence of tumor and had been manually microdissected to enrich tumor content, usually to >75% of
total sample nuclei. The pyrosequencing method, a polymerase chain reaction-based DNA-sequencing technique,
which detects a bioluminescence signal caused by the
release of pyrophosphate when a nucleotide is introduced
into the DNA strand, was used to detect mutations in

These were previous treatments for metastatic disease and did not include adjuvant therapy.

BRAF exon 15 or NRAS exons 2 and 3 (focused on codons
12, 13, and 61). The lower limit of detection of this assay
was approximately 1 mutation-bearing cell per 10 cells
(10%). This method also detects mutations in codons adjacent to those listed as the focus of the assay and has a
higher sensitivity than Sanger sequencing. When necessary, traditional Sanger sequencing was used to clarify a
result. All mutation analyses were performed at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Statistical Analysis

For the current post hoc analysis, the Fisher exact test was
used to determine the relation of gene mutation status
with the clinical response rate and the dichotomized TTP
(12 weeks vs >12 weeks). The median TTP was presented for each of the BRAF and NRAS subgroups using
Kaplan-Meier analysis and was compared between the
mutant and wild-type groups using the Wilcoxon ranksum test. All P values < .05 were considered statistically
significant. All analyses were performed using SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

From March 2008 to June 2009, 29 patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma were enrolled and received
treatment with 4 different selumetinib-based combinations. Eighteen of those patients had adequate tumor tissues

available for mutation analysis. The baseline characteristics
of these patients are provided in Table 1. Nine patients
(50%) harbored a BRAF mutation (8 V600E mutations; 1
arginine nonsense mutation at residue 603 [R603]), and 4
(22%) patients harbored a mutation in NRAS (2 glutamine-to-arginine substitution at residue 61 [Q61R]; 1 glutamine-to-lysine substitution at residue 61 [Q61K]; and 1
glycine-to-lysine substitution at residue 12 [G12S]). The
NRAS sequence could not be amplified on 1 patient. Overall, the patients had a good WHO performance status, and
most had either M1b or M1c, stage IV disease; 3 patients
had stable, treated brain metastases. The number of previously received systemic treatments was distributed evenly
across all groups (Table 1). No patient had received a
BRAF or MEK inhibitor before enrollment, and only 1
patient had received prior ipilimumab.
Treatment

One patient received treatment during the dose-escalation
phase of the study at a dose of 50 mg twice daily, and the
remaining 17 patients received oral selumetinib 75 mg
twice daily. Three of these patients required a subsequent
dose reduction to 50 mg twice daily. The numbers of
patients who received the different combination regimens
are listed in Table 2. The majority of patients (n ¼ 14;
77%) received the combination of selumetinib and dacarbazine, as expected. For patients who had previously
received dacarbazine or who had a contraindication to

agent (n ¼ 3; 17%). One patient (6%) received the temsirolimus combination. This patient’s melanoma harbored a BRAF mutation (R603 nonsense mutation), but
NRAS sequencing analysis was uninformative on the tissue specimen. No patient with melanoma in our analysis
received the erlotinib combination. The percentages of
patients who received the dacarbazine and selumetinib
combination were similar among the BRAF mutation,
NRAS mutation, and wild-type groups.
Response by Mutation

Overall, there were 5 partial responses (28%) and no complete responses among the 18 patients. All 5 responders
had a BRAF mutation (Table 3). The remaining 4 patients
with a BRAF mutation had stable disease as their best
response; none of the patients with a BRAF mutation had
disease progression within the first 12 weeks. In contrast,
no patient with a wild-type BRAF tumor achieved a complete or partial response, and 4 of those 9 patients had disease progression before week 12. The difference in the
response rate was statistically significant between the 2

patients with and without an activating NRAS mutation
(P ¼ .76) (Table 3).
The median TTP was 19.5 weeks for all 18 patients.
On univariate analysis, there was a trend toward an
improvement in the TTP for patients who had a BRAF
mutation (median, 51 weeks) compared with patients who
had the wild-type BRAF gene (median, 12 weeks; P ¼ .08)
(Table 4). However, in a multivariate Cox proportionalhazards model, the association between the median TTP
and the presence of a BRAF mutation was statistically significant (hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.060.82; P ¼ .02) (Table 5). There was no statistically significant correlation between the TTP and NRAS mutation status, sex, age, WHO performance status, or disease stage.
Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival and the TTP
according to BRAF status are provided in Figure 1.
At the time of the current retrospective analysis with
a median follow-up duration of 91 weeks, the median
overall survival for patients who had a BRAF mutation
was not reached, whereas the median overall survival was
60 weeks for patients with wild-type BRAF tumors.
DISCUSSION
Before clinical development of the selumetinib hydrogensulfate formulation, another formulation (selumetinib
freebase) was evaluated in clinical trials. In a phase 1 study
of oral selumetinib freebase in patients with metastatic
solid tumors, the dose of 100 mg twice daily was established as the maximum tolerated dose. This dose was evaluated in a randomized phase 2 study in chemotherapynaive patients with metastatic melanoma in which selumetinib freebase was compared with temozolomide.15

The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model suggested that BRAF status is an important predictor of TTP. Patients with WT BRAF were more likely to
experience disease progression than patients with BRAF mutations. There were no statistically significant correlations between TTP and sex, age, World
Health Organization performance status, or disease stage.

there was no apparent difference in efficacy between the 2
drugs; and, in a subset analysis, there was no difference in
the clinical response rate between patients with BRAF
mutations (11% response rate in both arms). It was noted,
however, that 5 of the 6 patients who had a partial response
to selumetinib freebase had BRAF-mutant tumors, whereas
3 of 9 responders to temozolomide had BRAF-mutant
tumors. Because monotherapy with selumetinib freebase
failed to demonstrate superiority to the standard of care in
patients with advanced melanoma, and given evidence in
preclinical models that the activity of selumetinib can be
enhanced in combination with a variety of agents, the phase
1 study evaluating selumetinib with dacarbazine, docetaxel,
erlotinib, or temsirolimus was conducted.
In the current study, we retrospectively analyzed tissue from patients with metastatic melanoma who were
Cancer

February 15, 2013

participating in a phase 1 study of selumetinib in combination with dacarbazine, docetaxel, erlotinib, or temsirolimus. Our hypothesis was that the presence of activating
BRAF and/or NRAS mutations would correlate with clinical benefit. In our analysis of a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma who had tumor tissue samples available
for BRAF sequencing analysis, we observed that patients
who had melanoma harboring a BRAF mutation had a
higher response rate and a longer TTP than patients who
had wild-type BRAF. All of the responders to the study
regimens had a BRAF mutation, and none of the patients
with a BRAF mutation had disease progression within the
first 4 cycles (12 weeks) of treatment. The median TTP of
the BRAF mutation group was 51 weeks. In contrast, 4 of
9 patients without a BRAF mutation had rapid disease
progression within the first 12 weeks of treatment. The
803

Original Article

median TTP of the BRAF wild-type cohort was 12 weeks.
Our findings suggest that BRAF status is an important
predictor of the TTP based on a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model. Without data from a randomized
trial, however, the predictive versus prognostic effects of
BRAF status cannot be distinguished. In the current study,
we did not observe any statistically significant correlation
between the TTP and other factors, such as sex, age,
WHO performance status, or disease stage, probably
because of the small number of patients in our analysis.
We also observed no association between clinical outcome and NRAS mutation status. The small number of
patients with an NRAS mutation made it impossible to draw
any meaningful conclusions regarding the clinical benefit of
selumetinib-containing combination regimens in the NRAS
population. It is also not known whether trametinib, another
selective MEK inhibitor, has clinical activity in this patient
subset. However, the results from a recent phase 1 study of
MEK162, another MEK inhibitor, demonstrated that 6 of
30 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring an NRAS
mutation had an objective clinical response.16 This finding
suggests that MEK inhibition alone can lead to clinically
meaningful activity in this patient subset. It is not clear
whether the specific drug, the type of NRAS mutation, or
simply the small sample size of each study can explain the discrepant results among these agents. We need further investigation involving a larger cohort of patients to evaluate the
true contribution of MEK inhibition in this patient subset.
There are several selective MEK inhibitors currently in
clinical development. Among them, trametinib already has
demonstrated a survival benefit over chemotherapy in
patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma. This was most
recently demonstrated in a randomized phase 3 study, which
reported a clinical response rate of 22% with trametinib.17 A
recent phase 2 study of MEK162 also produced a response
rate of 23% among 35 evaluable patients.16 Once again, the
reasons for the higher response rates to trametinib and
MEK162 compared with selumetinib remain unclear. It
would be interesting to determine whether the newer formulation of selumetinib (hydrogen-sulfate) has clinical activity
similar to that observed with other selective MEK inhibitors.
The observed trend toward a clinical benefit in
patients with a BRAF mutation is not surprising in light of
preclinical data indicating the sensitivity of BRAFmutated tumor cells to selective MEK inhibitors and the
results from a phase 1 study of a MEK inhibitor, which
demonstrated a greater frequency of tumor reduction in
patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma.18,19 However,
the randomized phase 2 study of selumetinib versus temozolomide failed to demonstrate a meaningful clinical
804

benefit from selumetinib monotherapy.15 It is unlikely
that the cytotoxic chemotherapy agents alone were responsible for the superior clinical outcome in patients
with BRAF mutations in our analysis, because there is no
evidence that melanoma cells harboring a BRAF mutation
are more sensitive to cytotoxic drugs. In fact, the clinical
response rate and the progression-free survival of patients
with BRAF mutations who received dacarbazine treatment
in a phase 3 study comparing vemurafenib and dacarbazine were similar to what was demonstrated previously in
other clinical studies of dacarbazine in patients who were
unselected for BRAF mutation status.7,20,21 Our analysis
suggests that the sensitivity of BRAF-mutated melanoma
to selumetinib may be enhanced in combination with certain cytotoxic or targeted drug(s), and further combination studies may be appropriate in this population.
The BRAF mutation has become recognized as an
essential predictive marker for BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib).5,6,22 On the basis of the superior
survival benefit demonstrated in a phase 3 study, vemurafenib is now a standard of care for this patient population.
Unfortunately, however, a majority of patients will develop resistance to the BRAF inhibitor, and these patients
will need other targeted drug treatments. MEK and the
downstream extracellular regulated kinase 1 and 2
(ERK1/2) proteins become reactivated at the time of
treatment resistance to a BRAF inhibitor in some melanoma cell lines,23-27 whereas these proteins continue to be
inhibited at the time of treatment resistance in other cell
lines.27,28 In the MEK-dependent resistance model, the
melanoma cells appear to depend on the activation of the
MEK protein through several mechanisms, such as the development of a secondary NRAS mutation,27 BRAF kinase amplification or alternate splicing,26,29 or the
transactivation of other RAF kinases23 with the reversal of
cell growth upon the addition of an MEK inhibitor. In
addition, COT (Cancer Osaka Thyroid; also known as
MAP3K8) overexpression has been implicated in MAPK
activation at the time of resistance.24 MEK-independent
resistance mechanisms include insulin-like growth factor
pathway signaling and activation of the phosphotidylinosityl-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway.27,28 This heterogeneity in
the mechanism of resistance also has been demonstrated
in patients’ tumor samples after treatment with a selective
BRAF inhibitor and implicates another stratagem, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss, as a putative
manner of resistance.25 Therefore, selumetinib (or other
MEK inhibitor)-based therapy potentially may be useful
in patients whose BRAF-mutated melanomas are refractory or resistant to a BRAF inhibitor alone, particularly if

those tumors continue to exhibit MEK dependence. Still,
it is currently unknown whether clinical MEK inhibition
after failure of BRAF inhibition has a role in the treatment
of this disease in this particular population.
In summary, although our patient numbers were
small, our retrospective analysis demonstrates that higher
response rates and longer TTP were observed with selumetinib-containing regimens in patients who had tumors that
harbored a BRAF mutation rather than wild-type BRAF.
Although our analysis demonstrated encouraging results,
our findings are not conclusive because of the limited sample size, the lack of a comparator, and the limitations of any
retrospective analysis. Our findings will need to be confirmed in a large, randomized controlled study. A randomized phase 2 trial comparing the clinical efficacy of
dacarbazine in combination with selumetinib versus dacarbazine alone in patients with BRAF mutation (National
Clinical Trial NCT00936221) may confirm the value of
therapy targeting MEK in this patient population.
