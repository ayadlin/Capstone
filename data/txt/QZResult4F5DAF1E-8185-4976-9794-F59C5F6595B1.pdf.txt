ABSTRACT
Purpose: Although activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) gene are predictive markers for response to EGFR inhibitors, 30–40% of EGFRmutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are de novo non-responders.
Hence, we sought to explore additional biomarkers of response.
Methods: We conducted a prospective pilot study to characterize the expression
and/or activation of key receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in stage IIIB-IV NSCLC
tumors. A total of 37 patients were enrolled and 34 underwent EGFR inhibitor treatment.
Results: As expected, patients bearing activating EGFR mutations showed
increased progression free survival (PFS) compared to patients with wild-type EGFR
status (9.3 vs 1.4 months, p = 0.0629). Analysis of baseline tumor RTK profiles
revealed that, regardless of EGFR mutation status, higher levels of EGFR relative to
MET correlated with longer PFS. At multiple EGFR/MET ratio cut-offs, including 1, 2 and
3, median PFS according to below vs. above cut-offs were 0.4 vs. 6.1 (p = 0.0001), 0.5
vs. 9.3 (p = 0.0006) and 1.0 vs. 11.2 months (p = 0.0008), respectively.
Conclusion: The EGFR/MET ratio measured in tumors at baseline may help
identify NSCLC patients most likely to benefit from prolonged PFS when treated with
EGFR inhibitors.

A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms
driving lung carcinogenesis prompted the development of
targeted therapies for the treatment of NSCLC in recent years
[5–7]. These targeted therapies are designed to antagonize
oncogenic ‘driver’ mutations and/or genetic abnormalities
that confer a growth and survival advantage to lung cancer
cells. In the past decade, many novel drugs, which include
monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors, have
been evaluated in numerous clinical trials and several are
currently approved for NSCLC treatment [8–13].
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is
a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that induces cellular

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer,
and is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide [1, 2].
The overall 5 year survival rate is low at 15% with over
half the patients dying within 1 year of diagnosis. Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80 to 85%
of lung cancer and most patients are diagnosed at an
advanced stage. Current treatment options for NSCLC
typically include a combination of surgical resection,
platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, radiation therapy
and/or targeted therapy [3, 4].

proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival and
angiogenesis when activated by the binding of one
of its ligands [14–16]. Abnormally elevated EGFR
signaling is associated with many common human solid
tumors, including lung cancer. In fact, the EGFR gene is
frequently mutated in 10–15% of Caucasian and 30–40%
of Asian NSCLC patients [17]. Reversible small molecule
inhibitors of EGFR, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, exert
anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated NSCLC patients
with few side effects and were initially approved for 2nd/3rd
line settings [18–21]. Furthermore, in 2013, erlotinib and
afatinib, an irreversible EGFR family inhibitor, were
approved for 1st line therapy in NSCLC patients bearing
activating EGFR mutations [10, 22, 23]. The most
prevalent activating mutations, exon 19 deletion or L858R
substitution, occur in the kinase domain and are mainly
observed among patients with adenocarcinoma histology,
never smokers, and East-Asian ethnicity [24–26].
The first randomized phase III trial comparing
gefitinib with first-line carboplatin and paclitaxel in
East-Asian never-smokers or former light smokers
with lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated superiority of
gefitinib in terms of response rate (RR) and progression
free survival (PFS) [27]. In this study, subgroup analysis
according to EGFR mutation status showed significantly
higher RR and prolonged PFS in EGFR-mutant patients
only when treated with gefitinib. In contrast, EGFR
wild-type patients did worse with gefitinib compared to
those treated with combination chemotherapy. Several
subsequent randomized phase III studies conducted
both in Asian and Western countries consistently
demonstrated similar results. Hence, EGFR activating
mutations are predictive biomarkers of high RR and
prolonged PFS for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
therapy in NSCLC [22, 23, 25, 28–30]. The median
PFS in EGFR-mutant patients treated with EGFR TKIs
is typically between 9 and 11  months. The response
duration, however, spans from months to years among
individual patients, suggesting heterogeneity within
this seemingly well-defined population. Although
preexistence of the EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutation
is considered one of the explanations, the exact
mechanisms for primary resistance or very short duration
of response to EGFR TKIs among EGFR-mutant
patients have not been fully explored yet [31–33]. In
addition to EGFR activity, alternate signaling pathways
may be stimulated in such tumors, underscoring the need
for a more comprehensive analysis of tumor pathway
circuitries in each patient.
While characterizing tumor signaling pathways is
highly desirable, it is challenging in the clinical setting
where tissue availability is mostly limited. Thus, the use
of methods that simultaneously evaluate the expression
and activation of key components in limited amount of
specimen is required. Using a highly sensitive and specific
multiplexed immunoassay, we report here RTK pathway
characterization of tumor cells from a cohort of NSCLC

patients. We find that higher levels of EGFR relative to
MET, another RTK with oncogenic properties in lung
cancer, correlate with prolonged PFS to EGFR TKIs.
Thus, the quantitative relationships between RTKs with
compensatory functions, may have potential predictive
value in the clinic and help guide therapeutic choices.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
A total of 37 NSCLC patients were enrolled in
the trial, and the baseline characteristics of this cohort
are listed in Table 1. The median age was 57 years
(range, 39–75 years) and both genders were almost
equally represented (female [n = 20, 54.1%] and male
[n = 17, 45.9%]). With the exception of one case, all
cancers were of adenocarcinoma histology (n = 36,
97.3%). EGFR mutation testing revealed that 6 patients
(16.2%) lacked information on mutation status,
9  patients had wild-type EGFR status (24.3%), and
22 patients carried EGFR mutations (59.4%). Among
the latter group,  activating  muta­tions including exon
19 deletion and missense mutation at exon 21 (L858R)
were present in 9 (24.3%) and 10 patients (27.0%)
respectively; the remaining 3 patients (8.1%) had nonactivating mutations. Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib
were used in 19 (51.4%), 14  (37.8%), and 1  (2.7%)
patients, encompassing 1st line (n  = 6, 17.6%), 2nd line
(n = 19, 55.9%), 3rd line (n = 8, 23.5%) and 4th line therapy
(n = 1, 2.9%), respectively.

Clinical outcomes to EGFR TKIs
Out of 37 patients, 3 patients did not use any TKIs
after enrollment, and were excluded from subsequent
analyses. EGFR-activating mutations were present in 19/34
(55.9%) patients with TKI use and equally distributed in
each gender. As summarized in Table 2, a high proportion
of EGFR-activating mutation positive patients responded to
EGFR TKIs (15 out of 17 patients with evaluable responses,
88.2%). However, 5 out of 9 evaluable patients (55.6%)
with wild-type or non-activating mutation EGFR status also
showed evidence of treatment response (partial response
[PR] or stable disease [SD]). Out of 8 non-responders
(progressive disease [PD]) to EGFR-TKIs, 2 (25%)
carried EGFR-activating mutations. While patients with
EGFR-activating mutations showed increased median PFS
over patients with wild-type EGFR status (9.3 months vs
1.4 months, p = 0.0629; Supplementary Fig. S1), statistical
significance was not reached most likely due to small size of
clinical cohort. Of note, however, an EGFR wild-type patient
(006-004) experienced a remarkable clinical response with
PFS of 23.4 months. On the contrary, 2 patients carrying an
EGFR-activating mutation (006-032 and 006-044) appeared
to be primary non-responders and did not demonstrate any
clinical benefit despite their genotype.

to EGFR TKI treatments

(Supplementary Table S1). While MET was widely
expressed in 25 out of 29 RTK-positive samples (86.2%),
HER3 expression was more limited in 24% of RTKpositive samples. When analyzing these RTK profiles,
we focused on patients whose response was discrepant
from general expectation (006-004, 006-032, 006-044).
Remarkably, we observed that a patient with EGFR wildtype genotype who experienced a prolonged clinical
response (006-004) exhibited high EGFR/MET ratio.
On the contrary, two EGFR-mutant patients who did not
respond to EGFR TKIs (006-032 and 006-044) had high
levels of MET (or low EGFR/MET ratio) suggesting the
EGFR axis may not be the main driver in these cases.
Next, we evaluated the quantitative relationship between
EGFR and MET in the entire cohort to assess whether any
correlation with the clinical response to EGFR inhibitors
existed. Fig. 2 depicts the Kaplan-Meier PFS plots
according to EGFR/MET ratio for the 27 patients with
evaluable information on both EGFR/MET ratio and PFS

RTK profile analysis using collaborative enzyme
enhanced reactive-immunoassay (CEER™) was
performed on tumor specimens collected from 34 patients
who received EGFR TKIs. RTKs were detected in
29 out of 34 samples (85.3%) and all 29 of these showed
some degree of EGFR expression ranging from 0.5 CU
to 193  CU (Supplementary Table S1). Examples of
immunoarray expression and activation profiles are shown
in Fig. 1. There was no significant difference between
the levels of EGFR expression in EGFR-activating
mutation positive patients vs. activating mutation negative
patients with median expression of 66.3 CU and 55.9 CU
respectively, p = 0.6906 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Furthermore, levels of MET and HER3 were
quantitated in the 34 baseline tumor specimens collected

who received EGFR TKIs. Indeed, a striking difference in
PFS was observed: regardless of EGFR mutation status,
patients with high levels of EGFR relative to MET (or
higher EGFR/MET ratios) experienced increased median
PFS compared to those with lower EGFR/MET ratios,
with statistical significance reached at multiple EGFR/
MET ratio cut-offs (6.1 vs. 0.4 months, p = 0.0001 with
ratio cut-off of 1; 9.3 vs. 0.5 months, p = 0.0006 with ratio
cut-off of 2; 11.2 vs. 1.0 months, p = 0.0008 with ratio
cut-off of 3, Fig. 2). Furthermore, despite bearing EGFRactivating mutations, NSCLC patients with increased MET
expression relative to EGFR (or decreased EGFR/MET
ratio) experienced a worse clinical outcome with short
median PFS (1.0 vs. 11.2 months, p = 0.0008 with EGFR/
MET ratio cut-off of 2; 1.0 vs. 11.5 months, p = 0.0099
with EGFR/MET ratio cut-off of 3, Fig. 3). These results
suggest that, in this limited cohort, the EGFR/MET ratio
measured in tumors at baseline is an effective stratifier of
PFS in response to single agent EGFR TKIs, irrespective
of patients’ EGFR genotype.
Of note, 7 out of 7 (100%) patients with PFS greater
than 12 months showed no evidence of HER3 expression
in their tumors, while 6 out of 20 (30%) patients with
PFS lower than 12 months carried tumors positive for
HER3 (Supplementary Table S2). We also analyzed the
RTK profile of samples collected at different time-points
throughout TKI therapy in 5 patients (Supplementary
Table S3). A comprehensive expression and phosphorylation

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

profile was observed in one clinical case (006-010):
a reduction in EGFR, HER2 and HER3 phosphorylation
was observed at the end of treatment compared to a
pre-treatment sample most likely reflecting on-target
inhibition of EGFR homo- and heterodimer signaling by
gefitinib. However, upon disease progression on EGFR TKI
therapy, a striking increase in MET activation was observed
in tumor cells from patient 006-010, possibly reflecting a
compensatory mechanism for tumor growth.

DISCUSSION
In order to evaluate heterogeneity among NSCLC
tumors, we quantitated the expression and phosphorylation
levels of common RTKs, such as the HER family, MET
and IGF-1R, in tumor cells isolated from pleural effusion
and/or fine needle aspirations (FNAs). Biological
specimens were collected from stages IIIB to IV NSCLC
patients at baseline, prior to the start of EGFR TKIs. While
85% of tumors analyzed expressed at least one RTK, the
vast majority expressed 3 or more RTKs, all potential
molecular drivers of cell proliferation and tumor invasion.
Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of growth signaling
pathways in NSCLC tumors is essential in order to better
strategize treatment options in the clinic.
In the present study, 56% of patients harbored
activating EGFR mutations, while tumor EGFR
expression was observed in 85% of all patients, regardless

of their EGFR genotype. In the absence of an analytical
tool to assess the functional status of EGFR, the activating
mutations serve as the primary biomarkers for selecting
NSCLC patients who will most likely benefit from EGFR
TKIs. While this approach does help identify a substantial
portion of responders, 30–40% of EGFR-mutant patients
are primary non-responders to EGFR TKIs. Furthermore,
many initial responders will eventually develop resistance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to EGFR inhibitors. Hence, there is a critical unmet need
for additional biomarker(s) of response to single agent
EGFR inhibitors in order to improve current patient
selection methods in NSCLC. Here, we report that
combined analysis of RTK proteins, EGFR and MET,
may be useful in identifying NSCLC patients most likely
to experience a clinical response with prolonged PFS
to EGFR TKIs. The current study suggests that higher

30934

EGFR/MET ratios correlate with a tumor’s addiction to
the EGFR pathway. It is expected that NSCLC patients
with EGFR-driven disease will show a substantial PFS
advantage over patients with both EGFR and MET-driven
disease (as evidenced by lower EGFR/MET relative ratios;
continuous variable) when treated with EGFR inhibitors.
Indeed, over 10 months of PFS advantage was observed
in patients with EGFR/MET relative ratios above 3 when
compared with patients with EGFR/MET relative ratios
below 3. Of note, patients with higher levels of EGFR to
MET experienced increased PFS regardless of their EGFR
mutation status. Hence, it is logical to speculate that the
relative ratio of EGFR/MET may serve as a predictive
biomarker for EGFR inhibitor treatment in NSCLC
patients and warrants further investigation in an expanded
prospective clinical trial. If validated, these results may
open up additional treatment options to include EGFR
TKIs for selected EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients.
The quantitative and comparative evaluations of
EGFR and MET potentially identify a subset of patients
who may benefit from dual blockade of these competing
drivers in NSCLC tumors. The phase III randomized trial
MARQUEE (NCT01244191) studied the dual blockade of
EGFR and MET, with small molecule inhibitors Erlotinib
and Tivantinib respectively, in stage IIIB/IV non-squamous
NSCLC patients with 1 or 2 prior chemotherapies and no
prior therapy with an EGFR or MET inhibitor [37]. This
trial was performed in a broad un-selected non-squamous
NSCLC population with 90% EGFR wild-type patients. The
investigators, however, did incorporate a non-mandatory
biomarker component evaluating MET expression by IHC,
MET amplification by FISH and circulating hepatocyte
growth factor levels (HGF, ligand for MET) for subgroup
analyses. The trial was prematurely terminated after
interim analysis reported that the study failed to meet its
primary endpoint of an overall survival (OS) benefit in the
experimental arm. In a similar study, the phase III MetLUNG
trial investigated the impact on OS of adding onartuzumab,
a monoclonal antibody against MET, to erlotinib in second
or third-line therapy of advanced NSCLC patients with
MET overexpression (NCT01456325). MET positivity was
assessed centrally using IHC and only patients with scores of
2+ or 3+ were enrolled, while 89% of patients were EGFR
wild-type. This study was also prematurely terminated as
it did not achieve any improvement in OS or PFS in the
combined arm [38]. Both of these failed studies, however,
did not consider the relationship between EGFR and MET
as patient selection criteria. Based on our findings, NSCLC
patients with lower EGFR/MET relative ratios, possibly
reflecting a requirement for both signaling pathways to
sustain tumor growth, may be the ideal patient subgroup to
benefit from combined EGFR and MET inhibition compared
to single agent therapy. This hypothesis should be tested in
future prospective clinical studies.
Tumors are known to evolve under therapeutic
pressure, it is therefore extremely important to continuously
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

monitor tumor growth signaling pathways to keep the
disease under control. In this study, we observed an increase
in activation of an alternate and compensatory RTK, MET,
at the time of progression on EGFR inhibitor treatment.
This compensatory signaling occurred despite initial tumor
shrinkage and clinical response to gefitinib. Patients with
detectable and activated alternate signaling in their tumors
may potentially benefit from a combination of targeted
therapies. Hence, in order to evaluate the functional status
of multiple signaling proteins in biological specimens with
very limited availability, a sensitive and specific platform is
required. In this report, we have successfully demonstrated
the use of a proximity triplex immunoarray technology for
this purpose.
In conclusion, our results suggest the EGFR/MET
ratio measured in tumors at baseline may help identify
NSCLC patients most likely to benefit with prolonged PFS
when treated with EGFR inhibitors. The current NSCLC
patient selection method based on activating EGFR
mutation status as primary biomarker of response to EGFR
TKIs has proven clinical utility, but remains imperfect as
it is unable to identify de novo non-responders. Based on
this study, we hypothesize that comprehensive molecular
profiling of multiple potentially competing RTKs can
substantially improve probability of selecting responders
to EGFR inhibitors. The expanded pathway-guided
therapeutic strategies based on the relative ratios between
different tumor RTK drivers should be further validated
for clinical use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient cohort and tissue specimen procurement
This is a prospective pilot study conducted at
Samsung Medical Center in South Korea, and patient
recruitment occurred between May 2010 and Dec 2012.
Patients were eligible if they had histologically or
cytologically diagnosed advanced stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.
Other inclusion criteria included age 18 years or older,
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 0–2, adequate organ function with
estimated creatinine clearance ≥50 ml/min, and one or
more measurable lesion. Exclusion criteria included
uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, heart disease, obstructive
pneumonia, infection, and uncontrolled symptomatic
brain metastasis. Eligible patients received gefitinib
(250 mg daily per oral), erlotinib (150 mg daily per oral)
or afatinib (40 mg daily per oral) until disease progression
or unacceptable adverse event. The study was performed
in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines
and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided
written informed consent. This study was approved by an
independent ethics committee.
Tumor specimens were collected either by isolating
cells from pleural fluid or via fine needle aspiration (FNA)
30935

process from 37 NSCLC patients as summarized in
Table 1. From each patient enrolled who met the inclusion
criteria, a sample was taken before the beginning of EGFR
TKI treatment. Whenever possible, FNA or pleural fluid
specimens were collected 4 weeks after starting EGFR
TKI therapy and at the end of treatment. Tumor cells
present in pleural fluid were immediately centrifuged
and the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in cell lysis
buffer, while samples collected by FNA process were
directly lyzed without centrifugation. The resulting lysates
were shipped to Prometheus Laboratories (San Diego,
CA) at ambient temperature within 48 hours of sample
collection.

sub-arrays on slides, then incubated overnight at RT.
After several washes, slides were incubated with two
detector Abs (for different epitopes) conjugated with
glucose oxidase (GO) and horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) respectively for 2 hours at RT. After washing
slides with TBST to remove unbound detector Abs, GO/
HRP-mediated tyramide signal amplification process
was triggered by adding biotin-tyramide solution and
incubating for 30 mins. Local deposition of biotintyramide was detected by incubation with streptavidinAlexa Fluor647 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
for 40 min. Slides were washed with TBST, dried and
immediately processed on a high-resolution fluorescence
microarray scanner (PowerScanner, Tecan).
For each marker, a sigmoidal standard curve was
generated from eight concentrations of serially diluted
lysates prepared from specific cell lines. HCC827,
a NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell line carrying EGFR
gene amplification and exon 19 deletion, was used for
EGFR and MET quantifications, while T47D, a breast
cancer cell line, served for HER2, HER3, IGF1R and
PI3K quantifications. Alternatively, standard curves were
generated from serially diluted recombinant proteins (AKT
and ERK assays). Each curve was plotted as a function
of signal intensity measured as relative fluorescence unit
(RFU) vs. log concentration derived units, Computed Unit
(CU). The data were fit to a five parameter equation by
nonlinear regression, simultaneously fitting both dilutions
of the capture Ab as described previously [35, 36]. CU is
a representation of marker expression in unknown samples
relative to that of control cell lines with known expression
levels. Because expression of each marker is determined in
unique CEER™ assays with different cell line standards,
only CU values of the same marker across various samples
can be compared.

Evaluation of clinical outcomes and statistics
Baseline tumor measurements were performed by
computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) within 4 weeks of study entry. The
response was assessed by CT scan every two cycles
according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
(RECIST) version 1.1 [34]. Patients were categorized
as responders to EGFR TKI when they met criteria for
complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable
disease (SD), whereas remaining patients with progressive
disease (PD) were defined as non-responders. PFS is
defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to
time of progression, death from disease, the last followup or the starting date of salvage chemotherapy. For
calculating and comparing PFS, the Kaplan-Meier method
was used followed by the Log-rank test. Statistical analysis
was performed using the Statistical package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Multiplexed-microarray printing
Capture antibodies (Abs) were printed on
nitrocellulose-coated glass slides (ONCYTE®, Grace BioLabs) using a non-contact printer (Nanoplotter, GeSiM).
The spot diameter was approximately 175 μm, slides were
kept in a desiccated chamber. Approximately 500 pL of
capture Abs were printed in triplicate and serial dilution
concentrations of 1 mg/ mL and 0.5 mg/ mL. Purified
mouse-IgGs served as negative controls. Immunoarray
slide configurations and assay format was described
previously [35].

Mutation analysis
DNA from tumor tissue was extracted using the
DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit or the QIAamp DNA FFPE
Tissue Kit (both from Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. EGFR mutational analyses
were performed by directional sequencing or PNA clamp
method.
