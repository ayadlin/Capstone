Abstract:
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation generally thought to be responsible
for cancer initiation and progression. Because CSCs are often rare in the total tumor
cell population and differentiate rapidly when grown in culture, it has been challenging
to uncover compounds that selectively target CSCs. We previously described CSCemulating cells derived from breast cancer cell lines that maintained a stable
undifferentiated state. We optimized a phenotypic assay with these cells and screened
1,280-bioactive compounds, identifying five that preferentially inhibited CSC-like cell
proliferation. Using a compound-guided target identification approach, we found high
topoisomerase I (Topo I) expression levels in breast CSC-like cells and primary breast
CSCs. Structurally unrelated small molecules targeting Topo I preferentially inhibited
CSC-like cells. These results illustrate the substantial power of this CSC phenotypic
screening platform and promote Topo I as a potential molecular therapeutic target
for therapies aimed at expunging CSCs.

INTRODUCTION

therapeutic ramifications. For example, patients with
tumors having a higher fraction of breast CSCs would
be predicted to have shorter cancer-free intervals, poorer
overall survival, and a greater incidence of distant
metastasis than individuals with breast tumors containing
a low CSC fraction and they do [12, 13]. Because tumors
contain mostly TACs, the CSC hypothesis predicts that
drug eradication of TACs may produce dramatic tumor
regression without providing durable cures if CSCs are
not concurrently eliminated. Indeed, taken to its logical
extreme, the CSC hypothesis implies that only the CSC
population needs to be eliminated because TACs will
eventually be lost through attrition [2]. Despite the
theoretical attractiveness of the CSC hypothesis, there
remains considerable controversy as to the importance of
therapeutically targeting CSCs. This is at least partly due
to the lack of functional chemical probes and successful
clinical agents targeting CSCs.
One strategy to identify small molecules that
selectively act on the CSC population would be to

The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis posits that
tumors harbor minority populations of undifferentiated
“stem cells” capable of making a binary choice between
unlimited self-renewal or progression to a differentiated
state [1-5]. Analogous to the hematopoietic system [2, 6],
CSCs divide infrequently while remaining sufficiently
abundant and undifferentiated to ensure regeneration
of new CSCs. CSCs can differentiate into so-called
“transient amplifying cells” (TACs) with high, but
limited, proliferative capacity [1-5]. As a result of this bipotentiality, CSCs are much more efficient than TACs in
surviving serial passage and initiating new tumors. The
model predicts that as a result of the disparate proliferative
potentials of CSCs and TACs the latter cell type will
comprise the bulk of most tumors. Minority populations
of CSC-like cells have been identified in many solid tumor
types and established cancer cell lines [7-11].
The CSC hypothesis has profound prognostic and

to be critical for CSC survival [14]. Some examples
of these self-renewal pathways include: Wnt, Notch,

and Hedgehog [14-18], HER2 signaling [19, 20], and
macromolecules that control the dialog between CSCs
and their microenvironment, such as CXCR1 and

IL-8 [19]. An alternative strategy would be to perform
unbiased screens with small molecule libraries focused on
identifying agents that kill CSCs. The latter tactic requires
a large supply of stable and homogenous CSCs to ensure
high quality robust screening assays. To date it has not
been practical, because CSCs are quite often rare [1, 2, 21,
22]. Moreover, long-term studies are problematic because
CSCs tend to differentiate into TACs and thus rapidly lose
their CSC-like properties. Finally, current purification
techniques only enrich for CSC and do not yield pure
populations [2].
As a surrogate, CSC-like cells have been generated
by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in
transformed HMLER breast cancer cells (human mammary
epithelial cells overexpressing hTERT, SV40T/t, and
H-RasV12) and used in a small molecule compound screen
[23, 24]. The transformed HMLER cell model [23] has
some limitations, however. First, the HMLER cell line was
derived by enforcing the expression of SV40 T-antigen
and mutant Ras in primary mammary epithelial cells.
Very few human breast cancers are associated with Ras

oncogene mutations and none express T-antigen. Second,
the starting cells are already fully differentiated at the time
of tumorigenic transformation and their final phenotype,
while undifferentiated, was more consistent with cells
undergoing an epithelial-mesenchymal transition than with
stem cells. Finally, the HMLER cells have enforced downregulation of E-cadherin, which may or may not have led
to the emergence of true CSCs that faithfully recapitulate
those arising from clinical specimens.
As an alternative, we derived cell populations from
three different human cell lines that emulate many of the
properties of breast CSCs and can be maintained in an
undifferentiated state for extended periods [25]. These
“blocked” CSC-emulating cells can be distinguished from
non-CSCs by their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs,
hypoxic and acidotic conditions, by their transcriptional
profiles, and by their superior tumor-initiating activities
[25]. Moreover, we observed that the CSC-initiated tumors
were composed almost exclusively of pure CSCs, thus
providing incontrovertible evidence that they retain their
undifferentiated state in vivo [25]. These blocked CSCs

are the only cells known to us that are derived directly
from naturally arising human tumors and, thus, represent
unique reagents for studying CSC-like properties in a
homogeneous, non-differentiating state and may provide
a functional tool for use with high throughput screening
approaches to identify novel CSC-selective chemical
probes and therapeutic leads.
In the current study, we describe the development
and optimization of an assay suitable for high throughput
screening. We then used the assay to interrogate the widely
available Library of Pharmaceutical Active Compounds
(LOPAC), which includes 1,280 known bioactive small
molecules to identify compounds that selectively target
breast CSCs. We discovered five small molecules that
preferentially inhibit the growth of CSC-like cells, one
of which was β-lapachone. This compound has a number
of reported activities including the generation of reactive
oxygen species and inhibition of topoisomerase I (Topo
I). Topo I is an attractive actionable molecular cancer
target because there are experimental and clinically used
Topo I inhibitors. Remarkably, we observed high Topo
I expression in breast CSC-like cells and primary breast
CSCs and found other Topo I inhibitors from distinct
chemical classes also exhibited preference for the CSClike cells. Our data suggested that Topo I might be a
potential CSC marker and thus an attractive therapeutic
target.

384-well cell plating density for BC1A and BC1B cells
was 1,000 cells/well and similar results were obtained
with the BC2 cell pair (Supplemental Fig. 1). Both
sentinel CSC pairs tolerated DMSO concentrations of
≤1%. Plate variation was examined with BC1 and BC2
pairs using different volumes of medium in each well (30,
50 and 75 µl) for the 72 hr incubation period to minimize
edge effects. Surprisingly, the well volume producing the
best coefficient-of-variation (<5%) was obtained with
30 µl. This volume had an edge/center ratio of 0.93. We
also conducted three-day variability tests to determine
the signal window and the Z’-factors with the minimum
(MIN) (a-MEM with 0.05% DMSO) and maximum
(MAX) (5 μM doxorubicin, 0.05% DMSO) controls. We
found <10% variability with the three day experiments,
signal-to-background of >8 and Z’-factors >0.5. One of
these three-day variability results with BC1A cells with a
Z’-factor of 0.83 is shown in Supplemental Figure 2.

LOPAC library screen identifies β-lapachone as a
candidate inhibitor of breast CSC-like cell growth.
We next examined the performance of the CSC-like
and non-CSC-like pairs in a high throughput screening
platform using a 1,280 small molecule LOPAC set. Both
pairs of cells exhibited reproducible results when tested
on separate days with Z’-factors between 0.52 and 0.89
(Supplemental Fig. 3). From this library we identified 35
compounds that caused >40% growth inhibition of BC1A
cells (Table 1). At the concentration tested (5 µM), most
of the compounds produced similar inhibition of both cell
populations. Five compounds, however, caused preferential
growth inhibition of BC1A cells compared to BC1B cells.
These were: A77636 (9.7-fold, p<0.02), rottlerin (3.0-fold,
p<0.001), β-lapachone (1.4-fold, p<0.004), CGP-74514A
(1.3-fold, p<0.02), and C-14 linker dequalinium analog
(1.3-fold, p<0.01) (Table 1). There also were several
small molecules, namely disopyramide phosphate, the
methotrexate enantiomer ametopterin, and cytosine-1-bD-arabinofuranoside, to which CSC-like cells were more
resistant. We also used the identical screening approach
with the BC2 cell pair and identified six compounds in
the LOPAC collection that caused a preferential inhibition
of BC2A cells compared to the BC2B cells (Table 2).
Complete concentration-response studies indicated
A77636, rottelerin, β-lapachone, and CGP74514A were
approximately 3-4 fold selective for BC1 CSC-like cells
compared to the non-CSC-like counterparts at multiple
concentrations (Fig. 1a). In comparison, the CSC-like
cells were more resistant to doxorubicin and etoposide,
indicating that the preferential inhibition of CSC-like
population by the identified compounds was not due to
artifact induced by the cell model or experiment design.
Pharmacological kinetic studies also suggested rottlerin,
A77636 and β-lapachone rapidly suppressed any increase

RESULTS
Development and optimization of the high
throughput CSC assay.
The establishment of the CSC-like and non-CSClike cells were previously described [25]. For simplicity
we have adopted the following nomenclature: BC1A and
BC1B for the MCF-7-derived CSC-like and non-CSC-like
populations, respectively; BC2A and BC2B for the MDAMB-231-derived CSC-like and non-CSC-like populations,
respectively; and BC3A and BC3B for the MDA-MB-453derived CSC-like and non-CSC-derived populations. We
initially focused on examining the two CSC pairs, BC1
and BC2 cells, because they are thought to be represented
of stage IV adenocarcinomas with BC1 being estrogen and
progesterone receptor positive and Her2/neulow and BC2
being negative for estrogen and progesterone receptor
and as well as Her2/neu (i.e., triple negative). Moreover,
they are maintained in the same culture conditions. Using
a simple, economical, and previously published [25, 26]
384-well metabolic alamar blue assay, we observed a
time- and cell seeding-dependent increase in endpoint
signal for cell viability. For both the BC1 and BC2 cell
pairs we found 72 hr to be the optimal incubation time
with the greatest signal to background level. The optimal

molecular targets to guide our efforts to understand the
ideal selective CSC drugs, while recognizing that the
true molecular target of β-lapachone remains somewhat
controversial. The first identified molecular target for
β-lapachone, however, was Topo I [31], an enzyme
critical in DNA replication and transcription [32] that is
often elevated in the tumor cells compared to normal cells
[33-35]. Thus, we first tested several other previously
identified Topo I inhibitors and found that camptothecin
and topotecan were 2-3 fold more potent against BC1A

inhibitors

Because β-lapachone displayed selectivity for both
BC1A and BC2A populations, has previously reported
preclinical antitumor activity, and has been the subject of
clinical trials [27-30], we focused on one of its putative

cells compared to BC1B cells (Fig. 2a). The preferential
inhibition of CSC-like cells was surprising because both
camptothecin and topotecan are substrates for the drug
efflux pump, ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member
2 (ABCG2), and CSCs are reported to have higher level
expression of ABCG2 [36-40]. Indeed, we observed
increased levels of ABCG2 in some CSC-like cells [25].
Therefore, we tested two other Topo I inhibitors that are
structurally unrelated to β-lapachone and are not substrates
for ABCG2. Both NSC 725776 and NSC 743400 were
more toxic to BC1A and BC2A cells compared to BC1B
and BC2B cells, respectively (Fig. 2b).

We next examined if Topo I expression levels
were different in the CSC-like cells and non-CSC-like
cells. Topo I protein levels in protein lysates obtained
from BC1A, BC2A and BC3A breast cancer cells were
increased compared to their non-CSC-like counterpart
(Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the mRNA levels in CSClike and non-CSC-like cells were comparable (Fig.

previous unnoticed in CSCs. We examined cells for their
Topo I enzyme activity by incubating cell extracts with
supercoiled plasmid DNA substrate at different titrations
to determine the minimum amount of cell extract required
for completely converting the supercoiled DNA to relaxed
DNA. As illustrated in Figure 3C, CSC-like cell extracts
completely relaxed the DNA substrate. In contrast,
supercoiled DNA was still detectable on the gel when
incubated with a 4-fold higher concentration of non-CSClike cell extract (Fig. 3C). Thus, Topo I activity appeared
to be elevated in the CSC-like cells by at least 4-fold in the
absence of elevated mRNA levels.

for identifying new molecular targets for breast CSCs.
β-Lapachone was ~4-fold more selective for the BC1A and
BC2A cells relative to their non-CSC-like counterparts.
β-Lapachone is an extensively studied naphthoquinone
nature product with documented antineoplastic effects
in preclinical models [42]. It has not achieved clinical
success, however, which may reflect its modest potency
and its limited aqueous solubility that complicates
formulation and delivery. A proposed mechanism for
β-lapachone mediated cell death is via activation of a
futile cycling by the cytoplasmic two-electron reductase
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, also known as
NQO1[43]. NQO1 reduces β-lapachone to an unstable
hydroquinone that rapidly undergoes a two-step oxidation
reverting to the parent compound and perpetuating a futile
redox cycle with the generation of reactive oxygen species
that damage DNA, activate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
and deplete cellular NAD+ and ATP. β-Lapachone is
toxic, however, even to cells that lack highly functional
NQO1, such as MDA-MB-231 cells, which harbor a
polymorphism that markedly reduces enzyme activity.
Thus, we were obligated to consider other molecular
targets. β-Lapachone has been studied extensively and,
as might be expected with a naphthoquinone, it inhibits
numerous enzymes at least in vitro. While we focused
on Topo I because it was the first proposed target of
β-lapachone [31] and there are clinically used drugs
available, the PubChem database (http://pubchem.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/) lists other potential targets including
Bloom’s syndrome helicase, RecQ-like DNA helicase,
thioredoxin reductase, histone lysine methyltransferase,
vitamin D receptor and cytochomes P450 2C9, 3A4, 2D6,
and 2C19. Some of these macromolecules may also be
CSC-specific targets worthy of further investigation.
The CSC-like cells were 2-3 fold more sensitive to
camptothecin and topotecan. The two indenoisoquinolines,
NSC 725776 and NSC 743400, which are currently in
clinical trials, also displayed selective growth inhibition
to the CSC-like population. Compare to camptothecin
and its derivatives, NSC 725776 and NSC 743400 are
chemically stable, form persistent Topo I-DNA complexes
and have potent antitumor activity in preclinical models
[44, 45]. The ability to target the CSC population adds
to the attractiveness of these compounds for further
development.
Our study highlights how an unbiased phenotypic
screen can lead to the recognition of a previously
unsuspected CSC molecular target. The omission of Topo
I as a CSC molecular target may reflect a previous focus
on gene expression profiling; we saw no increase in Topo
I mRNA. Interestingly, studies in lower organisms, namely
Arabidopsis thaliana, however, link Topo I to stem cell
stability and cellular memory [46]. Topo I is an enzyme
that resolves topological DNA stress during replication
and transcription [32, 45, 47]. Previous studies suggest
that both proliferating and quiescent tumor cells have

Primary breast CSCs also express higher levels of
Topo I.
We next isolated CSCs from primary tumors to test
whether Topo I level were also higher in primary breast
CSCs. Primary breast tumors were enzymatically digested
to generate single cell suspensions and sorted by flow
cytometry using CD49f as a CSC marker. CSCs (CD49f+)
and non-CSCs (CD49f-) cells were cultured on coverslips
for 2 days prior to fixation and staining with Topo I
antibody and DAPI. As shown in Figure 4A, Topo I was
found exclusively in the nuclei of both cell types, although
CSCs had 2-fold higher levels of Topo I staining compared
to non-CSCs (Fig. 4B). We also investigated Topo I
expression in breast CSCs from frozen tumor sections.
To identify CSCs, we stained the frozen sections with
antibody against a CSC marker, aldehyde dehydrogenase
1 (ALDH1) [41], and found that ALDH1-positive cells
existed in the tumors as clusters with considerable intertumor variability in the percentage of ALDH1-positive
cells. ALDH1-positive cells were detected in 14 of the
19 tumor sections we examined. All 14 tumors with
detectable ALDH1-positive cells showed evidence of colocalization of ALDH1 and Topo I (Fig. 4C). There was
also, however, a population of ALDH1-expressing cells
that did not have high expression of Topo I. Consequently,
our data suggested Topo I expression is not necessarily
co-regulated with ALDH1 expression in primary tumor
CSCs.

DISCUSSION
In this initial high throughput screen, we focused
on the LOPAC collection because it contains an attractive
selection of approved clinical drugs and other small
molecules with known cellular targets. It is encouraging
the even from this limited screen different compounds
were identified with the two CSC-like and non-CSC-like
pairs, indicating that CSCs from different cell lines may
have distinct key cellular targets/pathways even though
they share many common CSC properties. Our experience
with one compound, β-lapachone, illustrates that potential

up-regulated, higher levels of Topo I compared to normal
cells [48]. We found Topo I expression and activity were
higher in the CSC-like cells compared to the non-CSC-like
counterpart and elevated levels of Topo I were seen in CSC
from primary tumors. It is notable that Topo I inhibitors
have to date not been found useful in the treatment of
human breast cancer, which may reflect the involvement
of other resistance factors for the existing clinically used
drugs. Thus, development of structural distinct Topo I
inhibitors, like NSC 725766 and NSC 743400 appears
warranted. While we recognize phenotypically distinct
populations of CSC may exist in patient-derived tumors

from different organ sites, we propose Topo I might not
only be a valuable molecular target for some CSC but also
a useful adjunct for CSC diagnostic reagents.

METHODS
Cell culture
CSC-like and non-CSC-like cells were previously
described [25] as being derived from MCF-7, MDA-

Figure 4: Higher Topo I expression in primary breast CSCs. (A) CSCs and non-CSCs were isolated from primary tumors using

CD49f as a marker and stained with anti-Topo I antibody (red) and DAPI (blue). Cells were directly examined by fluorescence microscopy
and Topo I was found expressed exclusively in the nuclei. CSC (CD49f+ cells) had much higher level of Topo I staining compared to nonCSC (CD49f- cells). Images showed 3 representative cells of CSC and non-CSC. (B) Topo I mean fluorescence intensity was higher in
CSC-like cells. Fluorescence intensity of each cell was quantified using the Image J software. 41 CD49f– cells and 50 CD49f+ cells were
measured and mean fluorescence intensities were calculated. (C) Co-localization of breast CSC marker ALDH1 and Topo I in frozen tumor
sections. Frozen sections of 19 breast tumors were stained with DAPI (blue), anti-Topo I antibody (green), and anti-ALDH1 antibody (red).
Only a small subset of tumor cells expressed ALDH1 and these cells formed clusters (a and b). Co-localization of ALDH1 and Topo I was
evident in 15 out of the 19 tumors we examined. Panel c and d are enhanced magnifications.

MB-231, and MDA-MB-453 cells. Briefly, parental cells
were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP
driven by a 4.0 kb segment of the Oct 3/4 promoter and
selected using G418. GFP-positive (CSC-like) and GFPnegative (non-CSC-like) cells were separated using flow
cytometry. These well-characterized cell pairs [25] will
be referred throughout this report as BC1A and BC1B
for the MCF-7-derived CSC-like and non-CSC-like
populations, respectively, BC2A and BC2B for the MDAMB-231-derived CSC-like and non-CSC-like populations,
respectively, and BC3A and BC3B for the MDA-MB453-derived CSC-like and non-CSC-derived populations.
BC1A, BC1B, BC2A and BC2B cells were maintained in
α-modified Eagle’s Minimal Essential Medium (α-MEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 100 µM nonessential amino acids, 100
units/ml penicillin G, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. BC3A
and BC3B cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified
MEM (D-MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 100 µM nonessential amino acids,
100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.
All medium and chemical supplements were obtained
from Mediatech (Manassas, VA) and serum supplement
was obtained from Atlanta Biological (Atlanta, GA). The
cellular origins of BC2A, BC2B, BC3A and BC3B have
been confirmed by genotyping but BC1A and BC1B have
not.

Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). Protein lysates (30 µg) from each sample were
loaded and resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were
probed with Topo I antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
β-Tubulin was used as a loading control.
Primary human breast cancer CD49f+ and CD49f–
cells were obtained from Dr. Jean Latimer at the
University of Pittsburgh. Cells were cultured on glass
coverslips for at least 2 days and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100 and blocked with 1% BSA. Cells were
incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human Topo I
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hr at room temperature
and with Alexa fluor 594 labeled anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 hr. Nuclei were counter-stained
with 0.05% DAPI. Images were captured with an Olympus
FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Center
Valley, PA). Fluorescence intensity was quantified using
the ImageJ software (NIH). In total, 41 CD49f–µ cells
and 50 CD49f+ cells were measured to calculate the mean
fluorescence intensity.
Human breast tumor samples were obtained from
the Tissue Bank of the University of Pittsburgh. Frozen
sections were prepared by the Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh histopathology facility. Tissue slides were
fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde and permeabilized with
0.5%Triton X-100. Slides were then blocked with 1% BSA
for 1 hr and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human
Topo I (Sigma) and mouse monoclonal anti-human ALDH
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) primary antibodies
for 2 hr at room temperature. The slides were then washed
with PBS and treated with Alexa fluor 488-labeled antirabbit and Alexa fluor 594-labeled anti-mouse secondary
antibodies for 1 hr; cell nuclei were counter-stained with
DAPI. Slides were photographed using an Olympus
Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope.

Compound conformation assays
For the confirmation assays, compounds were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise noted.
NSC 725766 and NSC 743400 [39, 49] were obtained
from the National Cancer Institute. For the concentrationresponse curves, compounds were diluted in α-MEM and
a two-fold serial dilution was performed in quadruplicate.
For the 10-point concentration-response study, each curve
was independently repeated at least 3 times. For some
compounds, additional growth curve experiments were
performed in 96-well plates in which 1000 cells were
plated per well (200 µl) and allowed to attach for 24 hr
prior to the addition of compounds. Cells were treated
with compounds for 4-6 days. Cells were then detached
with trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in 1 ml Phosphate
Buffered Saline (PBS) and counted by Vi-Cell Cell
Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc. Miami, FL).

Topo I activity assay
Topo I extracts from CSC-like or non-CSC-like
cells were prepared following a protocol provided by
TopoGen, Inc. (Port Orange, FL). Cells were scraped
into medium and centrifuged at 800 xg for 3 min at 4OC.
Cell pellets were re-suspended in 4 ml TEMP buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5), centrifuged again,
re-suspended in 3 ml TEMP buffer, and placed on ice for
10 min. Cells were then homogenized in a glass tissue
dounce tube for 8 strokes. Cell nuclei was centrifuged
at 1500 xg for 10 min at 4OC, re-suspended in 1 ml cold
TEMP, transferred to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, and
centrifuged at 15,000 xg (4OC) for 2 min. The nuclear
pellet was re-suspended in 50 µl TEP buffer (TEMP
but lacking MgCl2) and 50 µl 1M NaCl, placed on ice
for 60 min and centrifuged in a microfuge at 15,000 xg

Western blotting and immunochemistry staining
Cells in 6-well plates were washed 3 times
with ice-cold PBS and scraped into a modified
radioimmunoprecipitation buffer [50]. Lysates were
incubated on ice for 30 min and vortexed every 5 min,
and then cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 xg for 20
min. Protein concentrations were determined using the

4OC for 15 min. Protein concentrations of extracts from
CSC-like and non-CSC-like cells were determined using
the Bio-Rad Protein Assay and adjusted to equal protein
concentrations. Topo I activity was assayed using Topo
I Assay Kit (TopoGen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. To accurately estimate the Topo I activity, we
prepared extracts at two-fold dilutions, namely, 1:2, 1:4,
1:8, 1:16, 1:32, and 1:64. Briefly, 12 µl distilled water, 2
µl 10x assay buffer, 1 µl supercoiled DNA and 4 µl Topo I
extract (original extract or diluted) were added to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated for 60 min at 37 OC. After
adding 5 µl stop loading dye, the sample was loaded to a
1% agarose gel, subjected to electrophoresis at 2 volts/
cm and the gel stained with 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide
for 20 min at room temperature. Gels were destained
with distilled water for 20 min and photographed using
FujiFilm LAS-3000 (FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan).
