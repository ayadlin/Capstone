ABSTRACT
Purpose: We hypothesized that bortezomib, an agent that suppresses HIF-1α
transcriptional activity, when combined with bevacizumab, would obviate the
HIF-1α resistance pathway. The objectives of this phase I trial were to assess safety
and biological activity of this combination.
Experimental Design: Patients with advanced, refractory malignancies were
eligible. Patients received bevacizumab and bortezomib (3-week cycle) with
dose expansions permitted if responses were seen and for assessing correlates.
Pharmacodynamic assessment included plasma VEGF, VEGFR2, 20S proteasome
inhibition, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and
HIF-1α tumor expression.
Results: Ninety-one patients were treated (median=6 prior treatments). The
FDA-approved doses of both drugs were safely reached, and the recommended
phase 2 dose (RP2D) is bevacizumab 15 mg/kg with bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2. Four
patients attained partial response (PR) and seven patients achieved stable disease
(SD) ≥6 months (Total SD≥6 months/PR=11 (12%)). The most common drug-related
toxicities included thrombocytopenia (23%) and fatigue (19%). DCE-MRI analysis
demonstrated no dose-dependent decreases in Ktrans although analysis was limited
by small sample size (N=12).
Conclusion: Combination bevacizumab and bortezomib is well-tolerated and
has demonstrated clinical activity in patients with previously treated advanced
malignancy. Pharmacodynamic assessment suggests that inhibition of angiogenic
activity was achieved.

INTRODUCTION

clinical trials, partial responses (PR) have been achieved
in various solid tumors, including metastatic or recurrent
renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma,
ovarian adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and
sarcoma [27, 31].
We performed a phase I trial administering
sequential bevacizumab and bortezomib based on our
hypothesis that this combination will obviate the HIF-1α
pathway as a mechanism of resistance to bevacizumab.
The primary objective of this study was to determine
the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities
of the combination treatment of bevacizumab with
bortezomib. The secondary objectives were to establish a
preliminary descriptive assessment of anti-tumor
efficacy and ­anti-angiogenesis correlates with the drug
combination.

Angiogenesis, which has a fundamental role in
tumor growth and metastasis [1-3], is important for
supplying a growing tumor with oxygen, nutrients,
growth factors, hormones, proteolytic enzymes, and
hemolytic factors, and is a critical step in the pathogenesis
of metastasis [2-4]. Increased tumor vascularization and
tumor expression of pro-angiogenic factors has been
associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis
[3]. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family
of proteins and receptors play a pivotal role in tumor
angiogenesis and in the pathogenesis of a wide range of
human cancers [5].
One mechanism of tumor resistance to antiangiogenic therapy is upregulation of the transcription
factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), which
mediates adaptive responses to hypoxic conditions
commonly found in solid tumors [3, 6-14]. HIF-1α
promotes expression of various genes that encode
proteins involved in inflammatory reactions involved in
cancer [15]. HIF-1α overexpression has been identified in
a number of tumor types, including pancreatic, head and
neck, breast, renal, ovarian, bladder, brain, colorectal,
and prostate cancers, and overexpression correlates with
increased angiogenesis and metastasis [15, 16]. Thus,
HIF-1α inhibition in combination with anti-angiogenic
therapy is a promising strategy for targeting tumor
resistance [11, 17-20].
Anti-angiogenic agents that target the VEGF
pathway have demonstrated clinical benefit for a
variety of malignancies, including colorectal, lung,
glioblastoma, ovarian, and renal cell cancer [3, 10, 2125]. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to VEGF
that is FDA approved for the treatment of renal cell
carcinoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer,
and glioblastoma.
The proteasome is a large enzyme complex
responsible for the regulation of proteins involved in
various cell signaling pathways by degradation [26-28]
and proteasome inhibition induces apoptosis by interfering
with the regulation of signaling cascades implicated
in cancer, such as the nuclear factor NF- κB [27, 29].
Bortezomib, a boronic acid bipeptide, is a specific and
reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of
the 26S proteasome [30, 31]. While bortezomib exhibits
pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenic, and anti-proliferative
activity, it has also demonstrated the ability to inhibit
transcriptional activity of HIF-1α [27, 28, 30-33]. This
appears to be a class effect as the proteasome inhibitors
bortezomib and NPI-0052 have been shown in vitro
to inhibit tumor angiogenesis as a result of decreased
VEGF expression via downregulation of HIF-1α [33, 34].
Bortezomib is FDA approved for the treatment of multiple
myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. In phase I and II

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Ninety-one patients were enrolled (median 52.5 years
old, range 27-78). The median number of prior systemic
treatments was six. The majority of patients had an ECOG
performance status of 1. The most common tumor types
enrolled were RCC, breast cancer, rectal carcinoma,
nasopharyngeal, neuroendocrine carcinoma, and prostate
cancer (Table 1).

Toxicity and recommended dose
All patients were evaluated for toxicity (Table 2).
The highest dose level, dose level 9, with doses of
bevacizumab at 15mg/kg and bortezomib at 1.3mg/
m2, was reached without identification of an MTD and
further dose escalation was not performed above the
FDA-approved doses. Only one DLT was observed,
which was grade 4 acute renal failure on Day 19 in a
patient on dose level 9.
All dose levels were tested and shown to be safe.
Overall, the most common drug-related toxicities grade 2
or higher included thrombocytopenia (23%), fatigue
(19%), nausea/vomiting (12%), diarrhea (12%), arthralgia/
myalgia (10%), anorexia (9%), anemia (9%), neutropenia
(7%), and hypertension (6%). Thirty-three patients (36%)
experienced no drug-related toxicity higher than grade 1
and 66 patients (73%) had no drug-related toxicity higher
than grade 2.
Adverse events that required a dose reduction
occurred in 10 patients (11%). The causes of dose
reduction were thrombocytopenia (n=5) and neuropathy
(n=5). Four patients died while on treatment (two from
sepsis, one from acute myocardial infarction likely
related to sepsis, one from carotid hemorrhage, and
one from suspected pulmonary embolism), but these

Antitumor activity
Eleven out of 91 patients (12%) received more
than 6 months of treatment (Table 3). Among the 91
treated patients, four patients achieved partial response,
39 patients achieved stable disease (SD), 43 patients
had progressive disease (PD), and five patients were
inevaluable (Figure 1a). The partial responses included
three patients with renal cell carcinoma (−88%, −45%,
−30%) (Figure 1b) and one patient with nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (−38%) (Figure 1c).
The median number of months of treatment
received was 2 (range 0-14). Sixty-eight out of 91 patients
were measurable per RECIST. Among the remaining
23 patients, 18 were evaluable but not measurable
and five were not evaluable because treatment was
discontinued before the first restaging evaluation
(one for toxicity (carotid hemorrhage)), and three
withdrew consent (one due to side effects and desire
to pursue therapy closer to home, one so other therapy
could be pursued closer to home, and one because
the patient felt the dose of bevacizumab was too low
since higher doses were received on previous therapy).
The median time to treatment failure (TTF) was
2 months (range 0-14), and the median overall survival
(OS) was 7 months (range 0-43).

Prior bevacizumab and/or bortezomib
Out of 91 patients treated on study, thirty received
prior bevacizumab or bortezomib (33%, Table 1). Twentysix patients received prior bevacizumab only, three patients
received prior bortezomib only, and 1 patient received
prior bortezomib and bevacizumab, but not concurrently.
The median number of months of prior bevacizumab/
bortezomib therapy was 4.5. No statistically significant
correlation was observed in response or time on treatment
when comparing patients who received prior bevacizumab
or bortezomib with patients who had not received prior
bevacizumab or bortezomib (30 and 61 patients, p=0.43,
p=0.73, respectively). Of note, 4 of the 11 patients
with SD≥6 months or PR received prior bevacizumab
or bortezomib (renal cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma).
The renal cell carcinoma patient with the best response
on study (88% decrease in tumor size) had previously
received bevacizumab.

p=0.925 with Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This trend
was observed whether the samples were separated by
dose level (dose levels of bortezomib at 0.7-1.0mg/m2
(low) vs. 1.3mg/m2 (high)), response (SD≥6 months/PR
vs. SD<6 months/PD), or toxicity (Grade 2 or greater
thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and/or
neuropathy vs. none/other). No significant differences
in change in 20S proteasome activity were observed
when comparing patients with SD≥6 months/PR against
all others, when comparing patients with the described
toxicities against all others and also stratified by dose, or
when comparing low versus high dose levels. Some of
these comparisons, such as those for SD≥6 months/PR
against all others were limited by the small number of
patients.

HIF-1α
Among the 14 patients who underwent tumor
biopsies while on study, only five patients had adequate
tissue from both the pre- and post-dose tumor biopsies.
Characteristics of HIF-1α analysis in all biopsied tissue
is displayed in Supplementary Table S1. Among the five
patients with both pre- and post-dose tumor biopsies,
four had positive HIF-1α staining at baseline. All four
patients with positive HIF-1α at baseline demonstrated
a decrease in HIF-1α staining in the post-dose biopsy,
including three patients whose post-dose biopsy became
completely negative for HIF-1α. The average percentage
of cells staining for HIF-1α at baseline in these five
patients was 68% (100%, 100%, 100%, 40%, and 0%,
respectively) compared to 26% post-dose (40%, 0%, 0%,
0%, and 90%, respectively) (Figure 3). The small number
of patients precluded statistical correlation with response,
but two of the four patients with a decrease of HIF-1α
expression experienced a decrease in tumor size (19%
and 15% decrease in prostate and fallopian tube cancers,
respectively).

DCE-MRI
All patients were screened for eligibility for DCEMRI. The DCE-MRIs of 14 patients were analyzed. Among
the 14 patients, 12 patients had DCE-MRI performed at all
three time points (baseline, 24-48 hours, and end of cycle
1), and two patients had DCE-MRI performed at only two
time points (baseline and 24-48 hours).
DCE-MRI analysis demonstrated a trend in dosedependent decreases in Ktrans at 3 weeks (R=−0.83,
p=0.0053) (Figure 2a). Patients who were treated at higher
dose levels had a larger percentage decrease in Ktrans at
3 weeks. Standard error was calculated for each time point
and is included in Figure 2a. No statistically significant
dose-dependent trend was observed at the 24-48 hour time
point.
Among the 14 patients evaluated, four patients
received more than four cycles of treatment. These four

decreased within 1 and 4 hours after treatment (average
decrease of 10.44%, p=0.014 and 18.81%, p=0.004,
respectively, with Wilcoxon signed-rank test), but changed

DISCUSSION

patients did not demonstrate a statistically significant
trend of greater decrease of Ktrans at either the 24-48 hour
time point or the 3 week time point. At 24-48 hours, the
decrease of Ktrans among patients who eventually received
more than 4 cycles of treatment was 18.3% (standard
error 21.2%), compared to 24.2% (standard error 48.0%)
in the remainder of the patients. This trend of difference
between the two groups was not statistically significant
(p=0.24 with paired t-test). At 3 weeks, the decrease of
Ktrans among patients who received more than 4 cycles of
treatment was 14.4% (standard error 12.8%), compared to
16.4% (standard error 9.2%) in the remainder of patients
(p=0.79 with two-tailed paired t-test). A representation
of DCE-MRI analysis of a patient with nasopharyngeal
carcinoma is shown in Figure 2b.

In this study, we report the results of a phase I
dose-escalation trial of combination bevacizumab and
bortezomib. The rationale for this combination from
preclinical and clinical studies was based on the use of
bortezomib to overcome resistance to anti-angiogenic
therapy via blockade of HIF-1α upregulation [3, 7-14,
19, 33]. The combination of drugs was well-tolerated.
We successfully completed dose escalation to the highest
specified dose level, i.e. the FDA-approved doses of both
drugs (bevacizumab 15mg/kg and bortezomib 1.3mg/m2),
without reaching a MTD. Therefore, the recommended
phase 2 dose was determined to be the full FDA-approved
doses for both drugs.
The safety profile of combination treatment with
bevacizumab and bortezomib was successfully determined,
with the caveat that the MTD was never reached in this
study. Combination treatment with bevacizumab and
bortezomib was well-tolerated, with 36% of patients
who experienced no treatment-related toxicity greater
than grade 1 and 72% of patients who experienced no
treatment-related toxicity greater than grade 2. Treatmentrelated grade 3 and 4 toxicities included thrombocytopenia,
fatigue, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, neuropathy, anemia,
neutropenia, and hypertension, which are consistent with
the known toxicity profiles of the drugs. There were no
treatment-related deaths.
Five of 20 evaluable patients with advanced renal
cell carcinoma (median=4 prior treatments) experienced
SD≥6 months/PR on study (PR; N=3). The number of
patients is small but the 25% SD≥6 months/PR rate was
higher than would have been expected for treatment with
either agent alone in heavily pretreated patients [24,
36-38], suggesting that the combination may warrant
further study in this histology. In phase II studies of renal
cell carcinoma patients treated with bevacizumab in the
first-line or second-line metastatic setting, response rates
of 13% and 10%, respectively, were observed [24, 36].
In phase II studies of renal cell carcinoma patients treated
with bortezomib in the second- or third-line setting,
response rates of 5% and 11%, respectively, were observed
[37, 38].
Two of six patients (33%) with nasopharyngeal
carcinoma experienced SD≥6 months (N=1) or a PR
(N=1) on study. No monotherapy studies of bevacizumab
or bortezomib have evaluated activity in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, and there have been only limited combinations
studies. In one previous study, 46 patients with stage
IIB-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with
bevacizumab in addition to standard chemoradiation. The
two-year locoregional progression-free survival rate was
84% compared to 90% in other chemoradiation studies
[39]. In a phase I dose escalation study of bortezomib with
gemcitabine and liposomal doxorubicin, 1 nasopharyngeal
carcinoma patient out of 11 patients with advanced head

VEGF selected genotypes analysis
Because of previous published evidence that
polymorphisms of VEGF may correlate with the efficacy
and toxicity of bevacizumab combination treatment,
analyses of associations among selected VEGF genotypes
and treatment outcomes were performed [35]. Schneider
et al. previously demonstrated that VEGF-2578 AA and
VEGF-1154A correlated with superior overall survival and
VEGF-634 CC and VEGF-1498 TT associated with less
grade 3/4 hypertension.
Patients (n=7) with VEGF-634 GG genotype
compared to 9 patients with VEGF-634 GC and VEGF634 CC genotypes had longer median time to treatment
failure (TTF) (1.8, 95% CI 0.5-3.1 vs. 0.7 months, 95%
CI 0.1-1.3; p=0.045) and patients (n=6) with VEGF-634
GC genotype compared to 10 patients with VEGF-634
GG and VEGF-634 CC genotypes had shorter median
TTF (0.7, 95% CI 0.2-1.2 vs. 1.3 months, 95% CI 0.1-2.5;
p=0.042).
Patients (n=4) with VEGF-2578 AA genotype
compared to 20 patients with VEGF-2578 AC and VEGF2578 CC genotypes had longer median overall survival
(OS) (19.8 months, 95% CI 0.0-44.9 vs. 7.5 months, 95%
CI 6.6-8.4; p=0.03). Also, 4 patients with VEGF-1498
CC genotype compared to 14 patients with VEGF-1498
CT and VEGF-1498 TT genotypes had longer median OS
(21.8, 95% CI 0.0-46.9 vs. 7.5 months, 95% CI 4.2-10.8;
p=0.019) and 11 patients with VEGF-1498 CT genotype
compared to 7 patients with either VEGF-1498 CC or
VEGF-1498 TT genotypes had shorter median OS (5.7
months, 95% CI 2.4-9.0 vs.21.7 months, 95% CI 0.044.3; p=0.023). Finally, 7 patients with VEGF-634 GG

VEGF-634 CC genotypes had longer median OS (19.5,
95% CI 0.0-46.4 vs. 4.2 months, 95% CI 1.6-6.8; p=0.029)
and 6 patients with VEGF-634 GC genotype compared
to 10 patients with VEGF-634 GG and VEGF-634 CC
genotypes had shorter median OS (2.4, 95% CI 0.0-5.9 vs.

for combination bevacizumab and bortezomib in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma to further explore the efficacy
of this regimen.
HIF-1α has previously been shown to play an
important role in renal cell carcinoma. In at least 60%
of patients with sporadic clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma,
the von Hippel–Lindau tumor-suppressor gene (VHL) is
inactivated [41]. The VHL protein plays a critical role
in the cellular pathway that couples changes in oxygen
availability to gene expression through the regulation of
HIF-1α. Under normal oxygen conditions, VHL binds
HIF-1α, which leads to degradation of HIF-1α through
various mechanisms. When VHL is not present, HIF-1α
is not degraded. HIF-1α accumulates inappropriately
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in VHL-deficient cells during conditions of normal
oxygen tension [41]. These cells overexpress HIFregulated genes, including genes encoding angiogenic
factors [41]. The upregulation of HIF in cells deficient
in VHL is critically important in the tumorigenesis of
renal cell carcinoma [42]. Inactivation of HIF can inhibit
tumorigenesis among VHL-deficient renal carcinoma
cells in xenograft models [43]. VHL inactivation results
in increased activity of HIF and increased VEGF
expression [42]. Inhibition of VEGF with bevacizumab
and inhibition of HIF-1α by bortezomib is a logical
therapeutic combination for the treatment of RCC.
In our study, HIF-1 expression was evaluated
based on bortezomib’s ability to downregulate HIF-1α in
addition to proteasome inhibition. While the sample size
was limited and few patients received paired biopsies,

representative biopsy shows that HIF-1α protein is
strongly expressed in renal cell carcinoma cells (A;
original magnification: ×100). Neoplastic cells identified
by the arrow are also illustrated at a higher magnification
(B; ×400). Post-treatment biopsy from the same patient
shows that scattered neoplastic cells that represent less
than 1% of the biopsy express very weak levels of HIF1α (C). The arrow identifies these cells (C), which are
also shown at a higher magnification (D; ×400). Negative
control MCF-7 cells lack the expression of HIF-1α (E;

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (DCE-MRI) performed at high temporal
resolution following the administration of a gadolinium
(Gd)-chelated contrast medium is a noninvasive imaging
technology that can be used to measure properties of
tissue microvasculature. DCE-MRI is sensitive to changes
in blood volume and vascular permeability that can be
associated with tumor angiogenesis, and consequently
DCE-MRI is a promising biomarker for characterizing
tumor response to anti-angiogenic treatment [46-49].
In our study, preliminary assessment of Ktrans on
serial DCE-MRI demonstrated a trend of dose-dependent
decrease of Ktrans at 3 weeks, suggesting that greater
inhibition of angiogenic activity was achieved with higher
doses of the study medications. Because of the limited
number of patients who underwent evaluation with DCEMRI, correlations between clinical response and change in
DCE-MRI perfusion parameters are primarily exploratory
in nature. Among the 14 patients evaluated, the four
patients who received more than four cycles of treatment
did not demonstrate a trend of greater decrease of Ktrans at
either the 24-48 hour time point or the 3 week time point,
compared to the remainder of the patients.
Overall, 20S proteasome activity significantly
decreased within 1 and 4 hours after treatment (mean
change −10.44%, p=0.007 and −18.81%, p=0.004,
respectively), but changed inconsistently after Day 2/3.
This trend was observed independent of dose level (dose

decreases in HIF-1α expression were observed in four
or the five patients with paired biopsies, including two
patients who experienced a decrease in tumor size
(although not reaching PR). Future studies in larger
numbers of patients would be needed to explore the
relevance of HIF-1α expression as a potential predictive
marker. Of note, mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus has also
demonstrated evidence of HIF-1α inhibition, and a clinical
trial combining temsirolimus with bevacizumab and
liposomal doxorubicin demonstrated extensive anti-tumor
activity in multiple tumor types [44].
Similar to previously published observations [45],
no association between plasma VEGF or VEGFR2
changes was associated with response or duration of
treatment. The small numbers of patients precludes
robust calculations. New biomarkers need to be
investigated for association with response to antiangiogenic activity.
Consistent with the results of VEGF SNP analysis
in the ECOG 2100 Phase III breast cancer trial [35],
VEGF-2578 AA correlated with better overall survival
compared to the AC and CC genotypes. However, the
other significant associations identified in that study
(VEGF-1154A with superior overall survival; VEGF634 CC and VEGF-1498 TT associated with less grade
3/4 hypertension) were not replicated in our clinical trial,
possibly because of the small sample size or because of
the heterogeneity of our patient population.

levels of bortezomib at 0.7-1.0mg/m2 (low) vs. 1.3mg/m2
(high)), response (SD≥6 months/PR vs. SD<6 months/
PD), or toxicity (grade 2 or greater thrombocytopenia,
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and/or neuropathy vs. none/
other). Contrary to expectations, pharmacodynamic
inhibition of the 20S proteasome was not dose-dependent.
Bortezomib’s ability to inhibit 20S proteasome activity
in a dose-dependent manner is well documented in the
original dose-escalation trials of single-agent bortezomib.
Potential drug-drug interaction between bortezomib and
bevacizumab may be considered as a potential cause of
the findings.
In conclusion, the combination of bevacizumab and
bortezomib is well-tolerated at full FDA-approved doses
of each drug, and has demonstrated clinical activity in
patients with heavily pre-treated, advanced malignancy.
Preliminary assessment of pharmacodynamic biomarkers
and DCE-MRI suggests that inhibition of angiogenic
activity was achieved. Because partial responses were
observed, especially among patients with renal cell
carcinoma who had previously progressed on antiangiogenic treatment strategies, this treatment regimen
merits further evaluation.

permitted to be expanded by up to 10 patients to further
evaluate toxicity and correlative data. At the MTD, up to
an additional 10 patients with renal cell carcinomas (RCC)
were permitted to be enrolled to further evaluate safety
and efficacy. If a response was observed in a particular
tumor type with the study drug or drug combination, then
the study was permitted to be expanded to include a total
of 14 participants with that tumor type. Up to an additional
15 patients with biopsiable disease were permitted to
enroll at the MTD once it was determined, for the purpose
of exploratory analysis with additional optional correlative
studies. All enrolled participants were considered in the
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) analysis. Bevacizumab was
infused intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle with
a dose escalation range of 2.5-15mg/kg. Bortezomib was
infused intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21day cycle with a dose escalation range of 0.7-1.3mg/m2.
Bortezomib was infused only on days 1 and 8 of each
cycle at the initial dose level. Treatment was repeated once
every 21 days until prohibitive toxicity or intercurrent
illness, tumor progression, or patient withdrawal.
Toxicities were graded using the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Tumor response was assessed with Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 and World Health
Organization (WHO) criteria. Baseline radiological
assessment was done within 28 days before starting
treatment. Restaging evaluations were performed every 2
cycles (6 weeks).

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (DCE-MRI)
Optional dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) was performed on
consenting patients at the following time points:
1. baseline (within one week before day 1 treatment),
2. acute phase (24 - 48 hours after first infusion of
bevacizumab and bortezomib), 3. chronic phase (at
end of cycle 1). All MR data were acquired on a 1.5T
Excite HD scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI)
with CRM gradient system. DCE-MRI was performed
at high temporal resolution (<10s per imaging volume).
Sequential magnetic resonance images were obtained
before, during, and following the injection of gadolinium
(Gd)-chelated contrast medium. Following the acquisition
of localizer images, T1 mapping data were obtained
using a multiple flip angle fast spoiled gradient recalled
echo FSPGR sequence in a plane that included the target
lesion(s) as well as a reference vessel. Following the T1
mapping acquisition, the DCE-MRI scans were obtained
during slow steady breathing using the same pulse
sequence and from the same acquisition volume before,
during, and following bolus administration of 0.1mmol/

Healthcare) at 3ml/s followed by a 20ml saline flush also
given at 3ml/s. The total DCE-MRI acquisition lasted
about 8 minutes. All DCE-MRI data were analyzed using
a two-compartment model to yield the pharmacokinetic
parameters: endothelial transfer constant (Ktrans, min−1),

block solution in the Universal LSAB+ kit (DAKO).
Purified mouse anti-human HIF-1α monoclonal
antibody (catalogue number: 610958, BD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA) diluted in blocking buffer (1:100)
was added overnight at 4°C. Sequentially, slides were
washed 3 times for 10min and incubated with secondary
antibody LINK and then with secondary antibody
Streptavidin each for 30 min. Slides were developed with
3,3´-diaminodbenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate that
includes horseradish peroxidase, and hematoxylin was
used for counterstaining. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were
either untreated or treated with CoCl2 for 4 h to induce
the expression of HIF-1α and then used as negative
or positive control, respectively. MCF-7 cells were
processed in formalin to prepare paraffin embedded cell
pellets before staining. Photomicrographs were captured
using an Olympus DP70 camera (Olympus America,
Melville, NY) and the QCapture Suite Plus software
(Qimaging, Surrey, BC, Canada).

Plasma assessment of VEGF/VEGFR2
Optional whole blood (7 mLx2) was collected from
consenting patients at the following time points: pre-dose
baseline, 24-48 hours after the day 1 cycle infusion, and at
the end of cycle 1. Plasma levels of VEGF and VEGFR2
in duplicate samples were evaluated using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (human VEGF QuantiGlo
ELISA Kit recognizing VEGF121 and VEGF165
isoforms and human sVEGF R2/KDR Quantikine ELISA
Kit, respectively) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)
following the manufacturer’s instructions (lower limit of
detection=3.30pg/mL and 4.6pg/mL, respectively).

VEGF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
DNA was extracted from peripheral blood
mononucleocytes (PBMCs) or paraffin-embedded
tissue sections using the QIAamp® DNA Mini and
Blood Mini Kit or QIAamp® DNA FFPE Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to standard protocols
recommended by the manufacturer. The region of interest
was then amplified using custom PCR primers. Sanger
sequencing was performed on a 3730xl DNA Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems) using BigDye™ Terminator v3
chemistry (Applied Biosystems). Mutation analysis was
performed using SeqScape® Software v2.5 (Applied
Biosystems).

Plasma assessment of 20S proteasome inhibition
To determine proteasome 20S inhibition, optional
whole blood (7 mLx2) was collected and PBMCs were
isolated from consenting patients at the following time
points: pre-dose baseline, and then 1, 4, and 24 hours
after the initial bortezomib infusion on day 1 of cycle 1.
After isolation, cells were washed with PBS, placed in two
labeled cryovials and stored at −70°C in equal volume of
RPMI-1640 with 20% DMSO until analysis.
Proteasome 20S inhibition was determined, in duplicate
samples, by using a validated 20S proteasome activity
EIA kit, APT280 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) following
the manufacturer’s instructions (lower limit of detection
measured with control assay was 20ng/100μl reaction).

Statistical analysis
Analyses were descriptive and exploratory. Withinpatient comparisons were analyzed using paired t-tests and
Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Between-patient comparisons
were analyzed using unpaired t-tests and Mann-Whitney
tests. Correlations were assessed using either Pearson or
Spearman correlation analyses. Non-parametric analyses
were chosen when data were clearly not normally
distributed and/or had clear outliers. Analysis of VEGF
SNPs was performed using SPSS 19 computer software
(SPSS Chicago, IL). Many of the analyses were based on
small numbers of patients, and care must be taken when
interpreting non-statistically-significant results. Due to
the exploratory nature of the analyses, no adjustment was
made for multiple testing.

Immunohistochemical staining to assess the
expression of HIF-1α in tumor biopsies
Optional tumor biopsies were assessed for
evidence of malignancy on H&E stained slides.
Immunohistochemical staining to detect the expression
of HIF-1α protein was performed using standard
techniques. Briefly, formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded tissues were deparaffinized using alcohol
gradient. Slides were subsequently washed in 3% H2O2
for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
Antigen retrieval was performed using 1× DAKO Target
Retrieval Solution (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for 20min.
Slides were then allowed to cool down for 20min at room
temperature and blocked for 30min using the serum-free
