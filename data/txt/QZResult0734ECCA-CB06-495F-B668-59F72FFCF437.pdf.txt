Abstract
The cell surface glycoprotein CD44 plays an important role in the development and progression of various
tumor types. RG7356 is a humanized antibody targeting the constant region of CD44 that shows antitumor
efﬁcacy in mice implanted with CD44-expressing tumors such as MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. CD44 receptor
seems to function as the main receptor for hyaluronic acid and osteopontin, serving as coreceptor for growth
factor pathways like cMet, EGFR, HER-2, and VEGFR and by cytoskeletal modulation via ERM and Rho kinase
signaling. To assess the direct impact of RG7356 binding to the CD44 receptor, a global mass spectrometry–based
phosphoproteomics approach was applied to freshly isolated MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts. Results from a
global phosphoproteomics screen were further corroborated by Western blot and ELISA analyses of tumor lysates
from CD44-expressing tumors. Short-term treatment of tumor-bearing mice with RG7356 resulted in modiﬁcations of the MAPK pathway in the responsive model, although no effects on downstream phosphorylation were
observed in a nonresponsive xenograft model. Taken together, our approach augments the value of other high
throughput techniques to identify biomarkers for clinical development of targeted agents. Cancer Res; 72(17);

Introduction
The cell adhesion molecule CD44 is a transmembrane
glycoprotein overexpressed and linked to bad prognosis in a
number of tumor entities such as breast (1–3) and pancreatic
cancer (4, 5), hepatocellular carcinoma (6) and hematologic
malignancies (7). CD44 receptor varies in size and function
owing to N- and O-glycosylation and alternative splicing, which
affects predominantly the extracellular domain of the protein.
Despite not being a direct signaling molecule, CD44 is said to
be involved in a variety of functions that promote tumor
development, progression and metastasis (8). CD44 acts as
the main receptor for hyaluronic acid and osteopontin, participates in signal transduction processes by establishing speciﬁc transmembrane complexes with growth factor receptors
such as cMet, EGFR, HER2, and VEGF-R and by organizing
signaling cascades through association with the cytoskeleton
via ERM signaling and Rho kinase pathways (9, 10). Most
evidence of the functional role of CD44 has been obtained
from cell culture experiments with antibodies against all CD44

molecules or speciﬁc splice variants, activation of the receptor
by its natural ligands HA (11) or osteopontin (12), or by gain
or loss of function experiments in vivo (9). Herein we describe
the direct effect of RG7356, a novel humanized anti-CD44
monoclonal antibody directed against the constant region
of CD44, on human tumor cells in xenotransplanted mice
by a global mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics
approach. This study revealed short-term effects of CD44targeting on MAPK pathway that were further conﬁrmed by
alternative methods (Western blot and ELISA). In a tumor
model that was nonresponsive to RG7356 treatment, this
pathway remained unchanged.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
MDA-MB-231 were grown in RPMI1640 supplemented with
2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated FBS. PL-45
were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated
FBS. All media and supplements were purchased from PAN
Biotech (Aidenbach).
For the xenograft phosphoproteomics study heavily SILAC
labeled MDA-MB-231cells served as the shared reference.
Therefore, cells were grown as described earlier in RPMI1640
supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% heatinactivated FBS medium lacking arginine and lysine and
supplement with dialyzed serum and the corresponding concentrations of the heavy isotopic forms L-arginine-U-13C615N4
and L-lysine-U-13C615N2. After full label incorporation, cells
were lyzed in 8 M urea lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris
pH 8.2, 10 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mmol/L EDTA,

from Lifespan and b-actin (8226-HRP, ab20272, or ab6276)
antibodies from Abcam. Secondary antimouse antibodies were
from Roche Diagnostics (HRP-label, #2015216) and Invitrogen
(AP-label, WB20006). Secondary antirabbit was purchased
from Epitomics (3053-1). Used primary antibodies were validated with recombinant protein, stimulated cell lysates or
standards from commercial ELISA kits and selected from a
panel of 3 to 5 evaluated antibodies. Compatibility with applied
lysis buffer and with antigen concentrations present in analyzed xenografts was checked by a prepared standard MDAMB-231 tumor lysate. Western blots of total protein were
obtained by stripping the phospho-blots and reprobing with
the total protein antibody. If not indicated otherwise the
loading controls were generated by stripping of the total
protein blots and reprobing with b-actin antibody.
Leupeptin, aprotinin, PMSF, and orthovanadate were from
Sigma. Glycerol was from Gibco, Triton-X-100 from Roche, Tris
buffer pH 8.0 from Roth, and sodium chloride from Merck
Darmstadt.
Xenograft studies
Immunodeﬁcient SCID/bg mice were purchased from
Charles River (Sulzfeld). Animals used in experiments were
between 8 and 16 weeks of age. All experiments were conducted in accordance with local governmental regulations
(Regierung von Oberbayern) and Roche internal guidelines.
In vitro passage numbers 4 and 5 were used for inoculation. A
total of 1  107 for MDA-MB-231 and 5  106 for PL-45,
respectively, were injected subcutaneously into the right ﬂank
of mice. RG7356 was administered intraperitoneally in onceweekly intervals at the indicated doses. Control animals
received vehicle (20 mmol/L histidine, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
0.01% Tween 80). Tumor volume (TV) was measured and
calculated according to the NCI protocol [TV ¼ (length 
width2)/2], where length and width are long and short diameters of tumor mass in millimeters (13). At necropsy, tumors
were excised and immediately shock frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Generation of Cy5-labeled antibody
The puriﬁed mAb RG7356 was incubated in 100 mmol/L
potassium phosphate, pH 8.5 in a molar ratio of 1:5 with
Cy5 NHS ester (GE #PA15101) dissolved in DMSO. The reaction
was stopped after 60 minutes by addition of L-lysine up

to 10 mmol/L and the surplus of the labeling reagent
was removed by dialysis against 20 mmol/L histidine,
200 mmol/L sodium chloride, 5% Saccharose, pH 6.0. The
labeling degree was determined using the absorbance of 280
and 650 nm (see product booklet NHS Esters; http://www.
gelifesciences.com). The integration ratio of dye to antibody for
the present Cy5-labeled antibody was 3:1. Similar binding
properties of the parental and Cy5-labeled RG7356 were conﬁrmed by BIACORE analysis (data not shown).
Optical imaging
Near infrared ﬂuorescence imaging was carried out to
evaluate tumor penetration and accumulation of the Cy5labeled RG7356 and to check for its binding properties in
histologic sections.
Female SCID beige mice carrying either MDA-MB-231 or
PL-45 tumors of about 150 mm3 were injected via the tail vein
with 50 mg Cy5-labeled antibody per animal, which corresponds to a dosage of approximately 2 mg/kg. Mice were
sacriﬁced 24 hours after the administration, tumors were
collected and processed histologically to enable ex vivo optical
ﬂuorescence imaging in histologic sections by using the
NUANCE detection system.
Preparation of tumor lysates for Western blot and ELISA
Excised and weighed tumors were mechanically homogenized in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle. After homogenization and before thawing of the powdered tissue tumor
lysis buffer (1,000 mL per 100 mg of tumor tissue, composition:
10 mmol/L Tris buffer at pH 8.0, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 10% glycerol, 10 mg/mmol/L aprotinin, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 0.4 mmol/L orthovanadate) was added.
The material was carefully mixed and transferred to Eppendorf
tubes and allowed to thaw completely for 15 minutes at 4 C.
Subsequently the lysate was centrifuged for 15 minutes at
20,000  g and 4 C. After removal of the fat layer the supernatant was separated from the solid pellet material, split in
aliquots and stored at 80 C until analysis. An aliquot was
assessed by BCA-assay (Thermo Scientiﬁc #23223) giving protein concentrations in the range of 5 to 10 mg/mL. Typical
loading used for gels was 20 mg per lane (10–12 lane gels) or
10 mg per lane for 24 lane gels.
Preparation of tumor lysates and enrichment of
phosphopeptides
Excised and weighed tumors were diluted in 1 mL ice cold 8
M urea lysis buffer (see above)and the tissue was homogenized
by using an ultraturrax disperser and sonication. Cell debris
was sedimented by centrifugation. Protein concentrations
were determined by Bradford and to each xenograft sample
the same protein amount of the SILAC-labeled MDA-MB-231
reference cell lysate was added. After reduction (5 mmol/L
dithiothreitol, 30 minutes 37 C) and alkylation (22 mmol/L
iodoacetamide, 30 minutes at room temperature) of cysteine
residues the proteins were digested by the addition of lysyl
enpopeptidase for 4 hours (Wako; 1:300, w/w). After dilution

Phosphoproteomics of CD44 Antibody–Treated Tumor Samples

were further carried out after the addition of trypsin (Promega; 1:100, w/w) over night. The peptide mixtures were
acidiﬁed by addition of TFA to a ﬁnal concentration of
0.5% and subsequently desalted via C18 Sep-Pak columns
(Waters) as described by the manufacturer. Peptides were
eluted with 50% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, frozen in
liquid nitrogen, lyophilized and subjected to strong cation
exchange (SCX) chromatography to prefractionate the crude
peptide sample based on a previously described protocol
(14) using a PolySULFOETHYL A column (PolyLC; 150 
4.6 mm, 200 Å pore size and 5 mm particle size) operated
€
with an Akta
Explorer system (GE Healthcare). Brieﬂy, the
dried peptides were reconstituted in 1 mL SCX buffer A
(5 mmol/L K2HPO4, pH 2.7, 30% acetonitrile) and loaded
onto the SCX column. The peptides were then separated by
a linear gradient from 0% to 25% SCX buffer B (buffer A
supplemented with 500 mmol/L KCl) over 32 minutes at a
ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min Fractions of 1.5 mL were collected
across the gradient and combined to 12 distinct samples.
These samples were then lyophilized and the dried peptides
were subsequently reconstituted in 1 mL of 0.1% TFA and
desalted by using C18 reversed phase cartridges (Waters) as
previously described and lyophilized again. Phosphopeptides
of each sample were reconstituted in IMAC binding buffer
(40% acetonitrile, 25 mmol/L formic acid) and phosphopeptides were enriched by means of PHOS-Select iron afﬁnity
beads (Sigma) based on the protocol by Villen and colleagues
(14). Brieﬂy, 5 mL of equilibrated IMAC beads were loaded
onto in-house made IMAC-C18-STAGE-Tips (IMAC-StageTips) and the peptide samples were loaded by centrifugation
(3,000 rpm). The ﬂow-through was collected and repeatedly
loaded onto a second IMAC-StageTip. After washing with 1%
formic acid, the phosphopeptides were eluted onto the C18
material frit with 500 mmol/L K2HPO4. Phosphopeptides
were eluted with 50% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, after
additional washing steps with 1% and 0.5% acetic acid, and
dried in a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf) and reconstituted in 0.5% acetic acid before MS-analysis.
ELISA
The commercial p-ERK1/2 Duoset from R&D Systems
(DYC185) was chosen for background and sensitivity optimization with alternative blocking buffers. Because the original
ELISA was not sensitive enough to measure the p-ERK concentrations present in MDA-MB 231 lysates, the blocking
buffer and Diluent #1 were replaced by CrossDown buffer
(A6485) from AppliChem Darmstadt to reduce unspeciﬁc
binding. See Supplementary Fig. S4 for details. p-STAT3
(S727)-ELISA was obtained from cell signaling and used
according to the manufacturer's manual. Samples were measured as duplicates either 100 mg (orientating acute study) or
200 mg (time-course acute study) each.
Statistical analysis (Western blot and ELISA)
Developed ﬁlms were scanned by Image Scanner III (GE
Healthcare) and pixel density of spots quantiﬁed by ImageQuant 7.0 (GE Healthcare). Statistical signiﬁcance was checked
by using the double side Student t test.

Mass spectrometric analysis
The peptide samples were directly loaded onto a selfmade reversed phase analytical column (Reprusil-Pur C18AQ, 3 mm, Dr Maisch GmbH) at a ﬂow rate of 500 nL/min and
eluted at a ﬂow rate of 200 nL/min over a gradient from 2%
to 30% acetonitrile into an Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer
using an Agilent 1,200 nanoﬂow chromatography system.
The Orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated in a datadependent acquisition mode cycling between full scans in
the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a resolution 60,000 and a
target value of 1,000,000 charges and the acquisition of 5
consecutive fragmentation spectra (MS/MS mode) of the
most abundant peptide ions in the linear ion trap at a target
value of 5,000 charges. Ions that were once selected for datadependent acquisition were 30 seconds dynamically excluded for further fragmentation. To achieve maximal mass
accuracy for survey scans, the lock-mass option was enabled.
Moreover, for optimal phosphopeptide dissociation the
multistage activation modus was enabled in the MS/MS
mode.
Mass spectra were processed using the MaxQuant software package (version 1.0.13.13, 15, 16), applying the Mascot
search engine (version 2.2.0) for peptide and protein identiﬁcation. A concatenated forward and reversed Uniprot
database (version: 57.12) was used. Regarding the search
parameters, the minimal peptide length was set to 6 amino
acids, trypsin was selected as proteolytic enzyme and a
maximum of 3 missed cleavage sites were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was selected as ﬁxed modiﬁcation, whereas methionine oxidation, N-terminal protein
acetylation and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and
tyrosine residues were considered as variable modiﬁcations.
As MaxQuant automatically extracts isotopic SILAC peptide
pairs the corresponding isotopic forms of lysine and arginine
were automatically selected. The maximal mass deviations
of precursor and fragment ion masses were set to 7 ppm and
0.5 Da, respectively. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 was
selected for proteins and peptides and a posterior error
probability below or equal to 0.1 for each peptide-to-spectral
match was required.
MaxQuant postprocessing
The quantitative information on the phosphorylated sites
returned by MaxQuant was further processed as described in
(17). In brief, the contaminants, the reverse hits, and the nonclass I sites (18) were removed, the ratios between treated
samples and vehicle controls were calculated, and the ratios
were log10-transformed.
Hierarchical clustering
To get an overview of the regulation occurring in the 3
different time points, hierarchical clustering analysis was
applied. First, the means over each experiment's 3 replicates
were computed, and sites with mean values in all of the 4
experiments (3 time points plus vehicle control) were subjected to the clustering. The hierarchical clustering was carried out with SpotFire (Tibco) using Ward's method with
Euclidean distance as similarity measure.

z-Score calculation
z-Scores were calculated for each phosphorylation site based
on the phosphosite's mean ratio and a globally estimated
standard deviation (20). In addition, a 2-sided P-value was
computed for each z-score, which was used for the in-depth
analysis of enriched pathways. Correction for multiple hypothesis testing was not necessary, because the pathway had been
identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly enriched beforehand.

Signiﬁcance analysis
The global rank test (19) is applied to ﬁnd signiﬁcantly
regulated phospho-sites. The original algorithm was not
designed to handle missing data, thus we split the dataset
into 2 subsets, one containing only sites with all 3 ratios
present and one containing those with one missing value.
For a ﬁxed FDR level of 0.05 (estimated nonparametrically
as described in ref. 19), the size of the top and bottom lists
(i.e., top-T and bottom-T, respectively) were then determined independently for sites with 3 ratios and sites with
2 ratios.

Subnetwork detection
The SubExtractor algorithm aims for extracting signiﬁcantly
regulated subnetworks from STRING. The program is
described in detail in ref. 20. In brief, SubExtractor combines
phosphoproteomic data with protein–protein interaction data
via a Bayesian probabilistic model. Signiﬁcantly regulated
subnetworks are found with a genetic algorithm and subsequent signiﬁcance evaluation based on the global rank test. The
STRING database used for subnetwork extraction was preprocessed to contain only human interactions with a conﬁdence
score >0.9. The algorithm's parameters were set to a ¼ 1:0 and
_
s ¼ 5:0, and subnetworks with an FDR < 0.05 were reported.

Functional enrichment analysis
Functional enrichment analysis was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway analysis (Ingenuity Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com/). Phosphorylation sites identiﬁed using the global
rank test were associated with biological functions and canonical pathways in Ingenuity's Knowledge Base. A right-tailed
Fisher's exact test was used to calculate a P-value determining
the probability that each biologic function or canonical pathway assigned to the data is because of chance alone.

Phosphoproteomics of CD44 Antibody–Treated Tumor Samples

Results
Xenograft results
RG7356 was shown to signiﬁcantly inhibit tumor growth
in a panel of xenograft models from breast, pancreas, liver,
and hematologic origins (21, 22). Weekly doses as low as 1
mg/kg, produce >80% tumor growth inhibition as shown
exemplarily for the HER2-negative breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1A). However, not all CD44-expressing
cells respond to RG7356 treatment: in vivo tumor growth of
pancreatic cancer cell line PL45 is unaltered under RG7356
therapy up to 30 mg/kg weekly dosing, despite having similar
CD44 surface levels as MDA-MB-231 (FACS analysis in vitro
and IHC at start and end of treatment period, data not
shown) and a similar tumor binding and penetration pattern
as shown by in vivo imaging experiments using Cy5-labeled
RG7356 (Fig. 1B).
Phosphoproteomic analysis
Understanding the factors that predict response to targeted
therapies (response prediction marker), as well as having an
early marker of treatment success (pharmacodynamic marker)
are mandatory prerequisites for clinical development of (targeted) anticancer compounds. Whole genome proﬁling is
mostly used for biomarker discovery. However, systematic
analysis of gene expression proﬁles needs to be independently
conﬁrmed because of a general lack of correlation between
transcript and protein levels (23). The proteome/phosphoproteome is closest to function, because it is the proteins that
perform most of the chemical reactions necessary for the cell
(24). Recent advantages in mass spectrometry–based phosphoproteomics allow monitoring the phosphorylation events
in a global, unbiased, and quantitative manner (17, 18, 25, 26).
These methods are applied here to analyze the effects of antiCD44 treatment on MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors. To avoid

peptides can be deduced to quantitative changes of phosphorylation at the corresponding site.
To quantitatively compare treated versus untreated tumors,
the recently published spike-in SILAC technology (27, 28) was
adapted for this study (Fig. 3). MDA-MB-231 cells were SILAC
labeled with isotopic forms of arginine and lysine in vitro. This
SILAC standard was then spiked into all xenograft samples,
thus enabling a quantitative comparison of the identiﬁed
phosphorylation sites across the analyzed time points.
For biologic interpretation of the derived mass spectrometric data we only referred to those phosphopeptide hits where
the phosphorylation site could be identiﬁed with high localization conﬁdence (class-1 sites). Applying the described
phosphoproteomics workﬂow on the mouse xenograft models
we were able to quantify 12,669 phosphorylation sites on
approximately 3,400 proteins from at least 1 treatment time
point against the vehicle control. Overall, 8,820 phosphorylation sites could be quantiﬁed in all treatment time points
against the vehicle (Supplementary Table S1). On average,

4334

Cancer Res; 72(17) September 1, 2012

about 4 sites per protein were detected with the majority
being phosphorylations on serine residues (10,755) followed
by threonine (1,707) and tyrosine (207).
Bioinformatics analysis
Hierarchical clustering of all phosphorylation sites detected
and quantiﬁed in all 3 time points showed that the phosphoproteome is most severely impacted at the latest time point
measured (þ 4.5 hours). Overall 381 signiﬁcantly regulated
phosphorylation sites were observed by the global rank test
(325 with ratios >2); 134 were downregulated and 247 were
found to be upregulated upon treatment.
In addition, all 8,820 quantiﬁed class-1 sites were used as
input for the SubExtractor algorithm (20), which detects
signiﬁcantly regulated subnetworks in STRING. The main idea
of this tool is to combine local as well as topological information, that is, information about the regulation of a certain node
(represented by the protein's strongest regulated phosphorylation site) and information about the connectivity with its

Figure 5. Downmodulation of p-ERK-signaling by RG7356 in MDA-MB-231 xenografts. A, orientating acute study; p-ERK (T202/Y204) signal of vehicle control
versus RG7356 treatment at þ4.5 hours (p-ERK1, p-ERK2, P < 0.001, double side t test). Duplicates of 100 mg protein were used for ELISA, P < 0.01.
B, time-course acute study: p-ERK (T202/Y204) signal of vehicle controls versus RG7356 treatment at þ4.5, þ8, þ16, and þ192 hours, respectively (P < 0.01
for þ4.5 and þ8 hours). A separate b-tubulin blot was used as loading control. ELISA: duplicates of 200 mg each (P < 0.001 for þ4.5 and P < 0.01 for þ8 hours).

neighbors. The probability of a node to be a member of a
regulated subnetwork increases the stronger a node is regulated and the more interactions it has to well-regulated
neighbors.
The largest subnetwork that has been identiﬁed by SubExtractor (FDR level 0.05) centered around the MAPK cascade
and comprises different biologic processes such as transcription and translation, the architecture of the nuclear core
complex, but also cell-cycle regulation and signal transduction
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The latter included Rho GTPasemediated signaling, which is involved in cell morphology and
adhesion/migration control. Similarly, when using the same
dataset in a functional enrichment analysis using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, http://www.ingenuity.
com/), the biologic functions signiﬁcantly affected by RG7356
treatment were mainly associated with processes and features
like cell-cycle progression, cell morphology and cellular development all of which are regulated by the MAPK pathway (data
not shown).
Enrichment analysis of the signiﬁcantly regulated phosphorylation sites with respect to canonical pathways again
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis similarly identiﬁed the
MAPK/ERK signaling cascade at the center of proteins
affected by RG7356 treatment. In-depth analysis on the level

www.aacrjournals.org

of regulated individual phosphorylation sites within the
MAP kinase pathway based on the z-score P-values (Fig. 4)
showed regulated serine phosphorylation sites on the EGF
receptor and the associated adaptor protein Sos1. Furthermore, highly regulated sites were found on members of the
Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Notably, the regulated sites found
here were direct targets of the preceding upstream kinases
(S218/S222 and S222/S226 on MEK1 and MEK2, respectively;
Y204/T202 and Y187/T185 on ERK1 and ERK2, respectively).
Despite the fact that tyrosine phosphorylations were in
principle accessible with the phosphoproteomics technology
applied in this study (207 tyrosine phosphorylations identiﬁed), no tyrosine phosphorylations were monitored on
EGFR.
The downregulation of phosphorylation sites was further
transmitted to the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (29–31) and
the translation initiation factor binding protein 4EBP1 (32, 33).
Both proteins play key roles in the initiation of ribosomal
protein translation and 4EBP1 phosphorylation is responsible
for the release of the translation initiation factor eIF4E. The
corresponding functional site on 4EBP1 (T70) was found to
be downregulated, which leads to a stabilization of the protein
complex and consequently to a suppression of protein
translation.

washed and reprobed with b-actin antibody and detected by an antimouse-AP antibody. B, digitalized Western blots; downmodulation was signiﬁcant
(P < 0.001) at þ4.5, þ8, and þ16 hours, respectively, for pY279 (GSK3a) and pY216 (GSK3b), for pS9 (GSK3b) at þ4.5 hours (P < 0.001), þ8 hours (P ¼ 0.001),
and for S21/S29 (GSK3b) at þ4.5 hours (P < 0.001).

An effect on transcriptional control can be inferred from
the observed downregulation of phosphorylation sites on the
transcription factors Jun, CTNB1 and STAT3 (S727).
Conﬁrmation of phosphoproteomics results
Despite its proven reliability to detect even minute alterations of the phosphoproteome under the inﬂuence of pharmacological inhibitors (34), we wanted to conﬁrm and extend ﬁndings
from this high throughput analysis by alternative methodologies. In a ﬁrst orientating acute study (study design in analogy
to Fig. 2, but using 4 animals/group/time point), with tumor
lysates from the very same þ4.5 hours time point as described earlier, phosphorylation status of p-ERK1/2, p-MEK1/2,
p-eIF4E, p-STAT3, and p-GSK3a/b, respectively, was evaluated
by Western blot and ELISA assays. Analysis of a second timecourse acute study (study design in analogy to Fig. 2, but using 5
animals/group/time point; tumors excised at þ0, þ4.5, þ8, þ16,
and þ192 hours, respectively) by Western blot and ELISA provided further insights on RG73560 s direct effects on tumors in vivo.
p-ERK1/2, a pivotal switch of MAPK-pathway signaling and
found to be changed in the phosphoproteomics study, was
analyzed by Western blot. In a ﬁrst orientating acute study, a
signiﬁcant downmodulation of the dual phosphorylation site
was seen at þ4.5 hours. A second time-course acute study conﬁrmed these results and showed signiﬁcant p-ERK1/2 downmodulation for the þ4.5 and þ8 hours time points (Fig. 5).
Data obtained from an optimized p-ERK ELISA matched the

4336

Cancer Res; 72(17) September 1, 2012

Western blot results and showed signiﬁcant p-ERK downmodulation for the same time points in both acute studies.
There was high variance in p-MEK as an upstream signal of
p-ERK. With no p-MEK downmodulation seen in the orientating acute study there was in contrast a clear down-modulation of p-MEK after þ4.5 hours in the time-course acute study
(Supplementary Fig. S2). ERK1/2 is known to associate with
GSK3b and prime it for further phosphorylation. p90RSK, a
downstream kinase of ERK, is responsible for the phosphorylation of GSK3b at Ser9 (35). This is consistent with the signiﬁcant reduction of phosphorylation at the Ser9-site of GSK3b
that was seen þ4.5 and þ8 hours after application of RG7356
(Fig. 6). At the same time points and after þ16 hours, there was
a pronounced downmodulation (P < 0.001) of the activating
phosphorylation sites Tyr216 (36) in GSK3b as well as Tyr279 in
GSK3a during the time-course acute study. For these 2 activating tyrosine-sites, there is a signiﬁcant enhancement of the
phosphosignal after 192 hours compared with the 4.5 hours
control. We interpret this as an adaption to metabolic changes
that are triggered by increased hypoxia and accelerated tumor
growth. Despite this increased phosphorylation in the untreated group, RG7356 shows a long-lasting reduction of GSK3a
(Y279) and GSK3b (Y216) phosphorylation even at 192 hours.
These results suggest that the induction of downstream metabolic events play a critical role for the response to RG7356.
Phosphorylation of the rare double phosphorylation site Ser21/
Ser29 present in GSK3b was reduced at þ4.5 hours. However,

ELISA, at þ4.5 hours (P < 0.01).

the biologic relevance of this speciﬁc dual phosphorylation
site and its downmodulation remains unclear.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),
suppressed in normal cells but upregulated or constitutively
active in many cancer tissues (37), is an important antiapoptotic transcription factor (38). ERK1/2 is believed to modulate
STAT3 activity through phosphorylation at Ser727 (39, 40).
The tumor suppression caused by sorafenib has been linked
at least in part to the dephosphorylation of STAT3 induced
by inhibition of the MEK/ERK-pathway (41). Our results
showed a reduction in p-STAT3 (Ser727) induced by RG7356
after þ4.5 and þ8 hours (Fig. 7), a ﬁnding also conﬁrmed by
a corresponding ELISA.
Eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF4s) are important regulators of protein synthesis and selective translation of speciﬁc
mRNAs that promote human cancer development (42). Stimulation of ERK and p38 MAPK has been shown to trigger
phosphorylation of eIF4 at Ser209 (43, 44). Changes in eIF4Elevels affect translation rates of proteins related to cell growth
and survival involved in oncogenesis, for example, c-Myc,
cyclin D1, and Mcl-1 (45). Therefore, inhibition of eIF4E
effectively suppresses cellular transformation and tumor

growth. Consistently, treatment by RG7356 caused a signiﬁcant reduction of eIF4E activation at Ser209 after 4.5 and 8
hours (P  0.01).
Effect on MAPK pathway in nonresponder cell line
Western blot analysis of tumor lysates from a PL45 acute
study (study design in analogy to Fig. 2), a tumor that did not
respond to anti-CD44 therapy as exempliﬁed in Fig. 1, did not
show any alteration of MAPK and related phosphorylation
events as observed for MDA-MB-231 tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S3).

Discussion
The crucial role of the adhesion receptor CD44 in tumor cell
behavior is well documented in the literature. CD44 is involved
in survival, progression, and metastasis of cancer and numerous reports describe the role of CD44 in cell–cell and cell–
matrix interactions with various partners as well as the function of CD44 to act as a sensor for changes in the tumor
microenvironment. However, despite this broad experimental
evidence, it is still unclear how pharmacological targeting of
CD44 exerts its effects on tumor cells (46). Rather, the current

knowledge on CD44 biology consists of a compendium of
individual results that do not always ﬁt together and are mostly
based on in vitro, rather than in vivo results. This situation is
further complicated by the structure of CD44 itself, which can
be modiﬁed by N- and O-glycosylation as well as alternative
splicing, producing potentially hundreds of CD44 variants
described of having differing roles in diseased and healthy
tissues. Herein, we describe a novel approach to determine
the direct effect of targeting CD44 with a humanized monoclonal antibody, RG7356, by global quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis of freshly isolated xenograft tumors.
This approach has several advantages compared with other
high- or medium-throughput methodologies such as geneexpression proﬁling or pull-down assays on immobilized
proteins followed by mass-spectrometry (47): (i) unbiased
-omics approach that provides information on whole pathways rather than single events, (ii) quantitative, (iii) applicable for in vitro and in vivo studies, (iv) captures the direct
effect of treatment on phosphorylation events, (v) can be
correlated to in vivo efﬁcacy, and (vi) ﬁndings can be easily
veriﬁed by conventional methodology and translated to
other responder/nonresponder models. Although s.c. xenografts do not fully represent the environment that tumors
grow in or metastasize to, this setting was chosen to
guarantee access to sufﬁcient amounts of tumor material
for ex vivo analysis and to focus on determining the direct
effects of antibody binding to the tumor rather than looking
at tumor–stroma interactions or other secondary effects.
RG7356 is a recombinant human antibody of the IgG1-kappa
isotype that speciﬁcally binds to the constant region of the
extracellular domain of the human cell-surface glycoprotein
CD44 that is present on CD44 standard as well as on all CD44
splice variants. Immunohistochemistry and FACS analysis
reveal that the RG7356 binding epitope is present on a broad
panel of cancer cell lines and patient samples from solid tumor
and hematologic malignancies. The antibody interferes with
CD44 HA interactions but does not seem to inﬂuence turnover,
downregulation, or shedding of CD44: ex vivo analysis of
xenograft tumors showed no alteration of CD44 surface expression even after prolonged treatment periods.
Short-term treatment of MDA-MB-231 xenografts, that
were previously shown to respond to RG7356 treatment
in vivo, results in a very rapid (0.5–8 hours) downmodulation of the phosphorylation of the MAPK pathway. Findings
from the global phosphoproteomics approach were inde-

pendently veriﬁed by Western blot and ELISA analyses that
completely matched the initial mass spectrometry results.
When evaluating the effect of RG7356 acute treatment on
the nonresponsive PL45 cell line, no alterations of MAPK or
related phosphorylations could be observed. In conclusion,
these studies show that CD44 is directly involved in the
activation of MAPK pathway regulated growth of tumors
that are sensitive to anti-CD44 treatment.
CD44 has been associated with alterations in the MAPK
pathway before (48–50). However, this is the ﬁrst study to show
a time-course effect on MAPK pathway caused by the pharmacological inhibition of CD44 rather than indirect methodology such as manipulation of the protein itself at the gene
expression level (knockdown or forced expression) or interaction studies with the receptor using hyaluronic acid or
fragments thereof.
Findings of this study provide further insights into the
potential mode of action of targeting the constant region of
CD44 with an antibody, potentially leading to relevant pharmacodynamics and response prediction markers to help guide
the preclinical and clinical development of RG7356. Further
studies to prove the utility of this methodology as well as the
relevance of this ﬁnding for RG7356 are warranted.
