heightened fatigue in women who received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

vidence suggests that fatigue is among the most common problems experienced by adult cancer survivors.1–3 For example, a
survey of adults who had been diagnosed with cancer approximately
1 year previously found that 67% reported a problem with fatigue.2
Although frequently reported, questions arise about whether fatigue
is a greater problem for cancer survivors than for people without
cancer. The issue reflects the finding that fatigue is also common in
the general population.4,5
One useful approach to determining whether fatigue is a greater
problem for cancer survivors is to compare survivors with individuals who have no history of cancer. Consideration should be given
to matching the samples on demographic characteristics associated
with fatigue, such as age,4–6 because differences in these characteristics could confound interpretation of results. Consideration should
also be given to recruiting samples of cancer survivors with similar
disease and treatment histories because variability in these characteristics is likely to contribute to variability in fatigue.7–9

Comparisons of the type proposed have been
conducted primarily with breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant therapy. In 1 study,10 88 women
with stage 0-IIIa breast cancer were compared with
an age-matched sample of 88 women who had benign breast problems but no history of breast cancer.
Patients had completed treatment an average of 25
months previously (range, 2–54 months), with the
majority (67%) having received adjuvant therapy
(chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy). Findings
showed that survivors reported greater fatigue on the
Piper Fatigue Scale and the Medical Outcomes Study
(MOS) Vitality Scale.
In another study,11 61 women with stage I-III
breast cancer were compared with an age-matched
sample of 59 women with no cancer history nominated by the patients. All the patients had received
chemotherapy and 48% also received radiotherapy.
The average time since chemotherapy completion
was 471 days (range, 108–875 days). Findings showed
that survivors reported greater fatigue on the Profile
of Mood States Fatigue Scale (POMS-F), the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory (MFSI), and
measures of current fatigue and fatigue interference
from the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI).
In a study using a similar design,12 45 women
with stage 0-III breast cancer were compared with an
age-matched sample of 44 women with no cancer
history nominated by the patients. All the patients
had received radiotherapy and had completed treatment an average of 22 months previously (range, 5–
88 months). No significant (P < .05) differences were
found on any of the fatigue measures administered
(POMS-F, MFSI, and FSI).
In a study limited to individuals age 70 year and
older,13 127 women who had been diagnosed with
breast cancer at least 1 year previously were compared with 87 women without cancer participating in
a longitudinal study of aging. Patients had been diagnosed an average of 5.1 years previously (range, 1–15
years), with 65% having received chemotherapy and
17% having received radiotherapy. Findings showed
that survivors reported more severe fatigue on the
MOS Vitality Scale and more frequent fatigue on the
FSI.
In 1 other study of this type,14 164 women with
stage I-III breast cancer were compared with an ageand race-matched sample of 164 women with no history of cancer recruited using the neighborhood control method.15 The patients had all been diagnosed
5½ years previously and treated with chemotherapy.
There was no significant (P < .05) difference on the 1
fatigue measure for which results were reported
(MOS Vitality Scale). A subsequent report derived

from the same study compared 267 disease-free survivors with 187 controls.16 There were no significant
(P < .05) differences between patients and controls
on the MOS Vitality Scale or the General and Physical Fatigue Scales of the MFSI. However, patients
who had not previously received an educational
intervention17 scored significantly higher on the
MFSI Mental Fatigue Scale than both patients who
had received the intervention and controls.
The lack of consistent findings across studies
can be attributed, in part, to differences in methodology. These include differences in fatigue measures
administered and differences in the average time
since treatment completion. Beyond this, several of
the studies have methodological features that limit
the conclusions that can be drawn. First, only 2 studies recruited comparison subjects without cancer
directly from the community.13,14 The possibility that
women with benign breast problems10 and women
nominated by breast cancer patients11,12 may have
problems with fatigue that could lead to biased findings cannot be ruled out. Second, only 1 study
recruited patients who were all at a similar timepoint
from the end of treatment.14 The wide intervals in
time since treatment completion in the other studies10–12 preclude generalizability of the results to a
specific timepoint in the survivorship period. Third,
only 2 studies12,14 limited participation to breast cancer patients treated with the same adjuvant therapy
modality. The other studies did not conduct analyses
comparing the treatment subgroups with their respective matches, possibly because of small sample
sizes. Consequently, it is unknown whether results
from these studies are generalizable to all the different treatment modalities represented in the samples.
The present study was designed to further an
understanding of fatigue after treatment for early
stage breast cancer by addressing several limitations
of previous research. To this end, the study used an
age- and geographically matched comparison sample
recruited from the community to limit potential
biases in reports of fatigue. The patient sample
included only women with nonmetastatic breast cancer who received adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy
alone or chemotherapy plus radiotherapy) to limit
variability in disease and treatment status. Sufficient
numbers of patients were recruited to permit meaningful comparisons of each treatment subgroup with
their respective matched controls. Finally, all posttreatment assessments were conducted in the 6
months after completion of radiotherapy to provide
information about fatigue at specific timepoints early
in the course of cancer survivorship. These data were
used to test the hypothesis that breast cancer survi-

vors would report greater fatigue than women with
no history of cancer. Differences between patients
and comparison subjects were expected to be greatest at the initial patient assessment, diminishing over
the 6-month follow-up period. Consistent with prior
research directly comparing treatment subgroups,18,19
we also predicted that women treated with both
chemotherapy and radiotherapy would report greater
fatigue relative to comparison subjects than women
treated with radiotherapy alone.

METHODS
Participant Selection and Recruitment
Patients were eligible if they: 1) were at least 18 years
of age; 2) had no documented or observable psychiatric or neurological disorders that would interfere
with participation; 3) were able to speak and read
English; 4) were women diagnosed with stage 0-II
breast cancer; 5) had no other history of cancer
besides basal cell skin carcinoma; 6) had been treated surgically for breast cancer; 7) were scheduled to
receive chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy
(CT 1 RT group) or radiotherapy only (RT group) at
the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC; Tampa, Fla) or the
Lucille Parker Markey Cancer Center (LPMCC; Lexington, Ky); 8) had no prior history of chemotherapy
or radiotherapy; and 9) reported no history of conditions in which fatigue is a prominent symptom (ie,
AIDS, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, or chronic fatigue syndrome). As part of a
larger study investigating quality of life, patients
were screened for eligibility and asked to provide
written informed consent during an outpatient visit
before the start of chemotherapy (CT 1 RT group) or
radiotherapy (RT group). Assessments relevant to the
current report were conducted at the end of treatment (just before the last radiotherapy treatment),
and 2, 4, and 6 months after treatment. Every patient
who completed the 6-month assessment was
matched with a nonpatient participant using procedures described below. Of 317 patients enrolled in
the study, 221 (70%) completed the 6-month assessment (MCC n 5 113; LPMCC n 5 108) and were
included in the present analysis. Compared with
patients who completed the 6-month assessment,
noncompleters were significantly (P < .05) more
likely to have received chemotherapy and radiation
and to have greater body mass index, less education,
and less income.
Eligibility criteria for nonpatients were that they
must: 1) be women; 2) be within 5 years of the age
of the patient to whom they would be matched; 3)
reside within the same zip code as their patient

1853

match; 4) have no discernable psychiatric or neurological disorders that would interfere with study participation; 5) be able to speak and read English; 6)
report no history of cancer (other than basal cell skin
carcinoma) or other potentially life-threatening diseases; and 7) report no history of conditions in which
fatigue is a prominent symptom (as described
above). Potential nonpatient participants were identified using a database maintained by Marketing Systems Group (Fort Washington, Pa) that draws from
all listed telephone households in the US and is estimated to include demographic and contact information for approximately two-thirds of the US
population. For each patient who completed the 6month assessment, up to 25 women who resided in
the same zip code and were within 5 years of the
patient’s age were selected randomly from the database. One of these women was randomly selected
and sent a letter of introduction. If this woman did
not opt out by calling a toll-free telephone number
(MCC) or did return a postcard expressing interest
(LPMCC), telephone contact was initiated to further
determine eligibility. If she met all eligibility criteria
and verbally agreed to participate, an appointment
was set up to obtain written consent and conduct an
assessment. If the first woman selected could not be
reached, was ineligible, refused to participate, or did
not keep the appointment, another woman on the
list was selected randomly until a woman matched
to the patient was recruited and completed the
assessment.

Measures
Demographic and clinical data
Age, race/ethnicity, marital status, annual household
income, educational level, height, weight, and menopausal status were assessed in all participants via
self-report. Disease stage, type of breast surgery,
chemotherapy agents (CT 1 RT group only), cumulative radiation doses, and hormone therapy status
were assessed in patients via chart review.
Fatigue
The Fatigue Symptom Inventory20 (FSI) is a 14-item
measure that assesses the frequency and severity of
fatigue and its perceived disruptiveness. Analyses
focused on participants’ ratings of fatigue severity
(0 5 not at all fatigued, 10 5 as fatigued as I could
be) on the day they felt most fatigued in the past
week (FSI most), on average in the past week (FSI average), and right now (FSI current). Analyses were
also conducted using ratings of the number of days
fatigued in the past week (0 to 7) (FSI days) and the
average rating of the degree (0 5 no interference,

1854

10 5 extreme interference) to which fatigue interfered with general activity, ability to bathe and dress,
normal work activity, ability to concentrate, relations
with others, enjoyment of life, and mood (FSI interference). Previous research has demonstrated the
reliability and validity of the FSI in women diagnosed
with breast cancer.11,12,20 Participants also completed
the 7-item Profile of Mood States (POMS) Fatigue
Scale,21 on which they rated the degree to which
they felt fatigued in the past week (0 5 not at all,
4 5 extremely). A total score was calculated (possible
range 5 0 to 28), with higher scores indicating
greater fatigue.

Statistical Analysis
Preliminary analyses were conducted to identify possible differences in demographic characteristics between patient and nonpatient participants. Chi-square
analyses were conducted on categorical variables (eg,
marital status) and t-test were conducted on continuous variables (eg, age).
In the main analysis, general linear models were
used to compare data on fatigue collected from
patients at the 4 assessment points with data collected from their nonpatient matches at their 1
assessment. Additional general linear model analyses
were conducted to determine whether differences
observed in the main analyses were attributable to
differences between CT 1 RT patients and their respective matches and/or RT patients and their respective matches. Analyses were also conducted to
evaluate the meaningfulness of statistically significant differences in fatigue between patients and nonpatients. In these analyses, participants’ fatigue
ratings were classified as ‘‘abnormal’’ if they were
more than 1 standard deviation (1 SD) above the
mean of the nonpatient group on the measure being
evaluated. A similar threshold has been recommended for identifying abnormal (ie, impaired) performance on measures of cognitive abilities.22 Scores
of this magnitude would be expected in normally
distributed variables to occur in fewer than 16% of
individuals. A mean difference on a measure was
considered to be clinically meaningful if chi-square
analyses indicated that the percentages of patients
and nonpatients with scores in the abnormal range
differed significantly.
Sporadic missing data on fatigue for 32 of the
442 participants (7%) were estimated using multiple
imputation techniques.23 A P  .05 probability level
(2-tailed) was used in all analyses to evaluate statistical significance. Analyses were conducted using SAS
statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). With
sample sizes of 221 individuals per group for the

main analyses, statistical power was adequate (>.80)
to detect small to medium size differences (d 5 .3)
in fatigue levels.

RESULTS
Characteristics of Patients and Nonpatients
Demographic characteristics of the patient and nonpatient samples appear in Table 1. Although age was
used as a matching variable, the nonpatient sample
was older than the patient sample by 2.44 years
(P 5 .006). Differences on all other demographic variables were not significant (P > .05). On the basis of
these results, age was included as a covariate in subsequent comparisons of patients with nonpatients.
Clinical characteristics of CT 1 RT patients and RT
patients appear in Table 2.
Comparison of Fatigue Between Patients at the End of
Treatment Assessment and Nonpatients
Significant differences were evident between patients
at the end of treatment assessment and nonpatients
on all 6 fatigue measures (see Table 3). In each
instance, patients reported greater fatigue than nonpatients (P  .008). The observed mean differences
appeared to be clinically meaningful in that a greater
percentage of patients than nonpatients scored in
the abnormal range on each measure (P  .001, see
Table 4). Additional analyses indicated that CT 1 RT
patients reported greater fatigue than their matches
on 5 of the 6 measures (P  .02, see Table 5). RT
patients reported greater fatigue than their matches
on all 6 measures (P  .02, see Table 6).

(P 5 .48), reported more days of fatigue than their
matches (see Tables 5 and 6).
Significant differences were also evident between
patients at the 2-month assessment and nonpatients in
ratings of current fatigue (see Table 3). Similar to the
end of treatment assessment, patients provided higher
ratings of current fatigue (P 5 .007). The observed
mean difference appeared to be clinically meaningful
in that a greater percentage of patients than nonpatients scored in the abnormal range (P 5 .02, see Table
4). Additional analyses indicated that CT 1 RT patients
(P 5 .02), but not RT patients (P 5 .10), reported greater
current fatigue than their matches (see Tables 5 and 6).
Significant differences were also evident between
patients at the 2-month assessment and nonpatients
in POMS-F scores (see Table 3). Similar to the end of
treatment assessment, patients scored higher on the
POMS-F (P 5 .05). The observed mean difference did
not appear to be clinically meaningful in that the
percentages of patients and nonpatients scoring in
the abnormal range did not differ (P 5 .30, see Table
4). Additional analyses indicated that CT 1 RT
patients (P 5 .05), but not RT patients (P 5 .36),
scored higher on the POMS-F than their matches
(see Tables 5 and 6).

Comparison of Fatigue Between Patients at the

Significant differences were evident between patients
at the 4-month assessment and nonpatients in ratings of the number of days fatigued (see Table 3).
Similar to the end of treatment and 2-month assessments, patients reported more days of fatigue
(P 5 .01). The observed mean difference appeared to
be clinically meaningful in that a greater percentage
of patients than nonpatients scored in the abnormal
range (P 5 .01, see Table 4). Additional analyses indicated that CT 1 RT patients (P 5 .003), but not RT
patients (P 5 .43), reported more days of fatigue than
their matches (see Tables 5 and 6).

POMS-F indicates Profile of Mood States Fatigue Scale; FSI, Fatigue Symptom Inventory.

Significant differences were evident between
patients at the 4-month assessment and nonpatients
in ratings of the current fatigue (see Table 3). Similar
to the end of treatment and 2-month assessments,
patients provided higher ratings of current fatigue
(P 5 .04). Although there was a mean difference,
there was no difference (P 5 .07) in the percentages
of patients and nonpatients scoring in the abnormal
range (see Table 4). Additional analyses did not
reveal significant differences between CT 1 RT

patients and their matches (P 5 .11) or RT patients
and their matches (P 5 .15) on this measure (see
Tables 5 and 6).
Significant differences were also evident between
patients at the 4-month assessment and nonpatients in
ratings of most fatigue (see Table 3). Contrary to predictions, patients provided lower ratings than nonpatients
of their level of fatigue on the day they felt most fatigued in the past week (P 5 .05). Although there was a
mean difference in most fatigue, there was no differ-

ence (P 5 1.00) in the percentages of patients and nonpatients scoring in the abnormal range on this measure
(see Table 4). Additional analyses did not reveal significant differences between CT 1 RT patients and their
matches (P 5 .31) or RT patients and respective
matches (P 5 .10) on this measure (see Tables 5 and 6).

Comparison of Fatigue Between Patients at the 6-Month
Assessment and Nonpatients
Significant differences were evident between patients
at the 6-month assessment and nonpatients in ratings of the number of days fatigued (see Table 3).
Similar to all 3 previous assessments, patients
reported more days of fatigue (P 5 .04). The observed
mean difference appeared to be clinically meaningful
in that a greater percentage of patients than nonpatients scored in the abnormal range on this measure
(P 5 .04, see Table 4). Additional analyses indicated
that CT 1 RT patients (P 5 .03), but not RT patients
(P 5 .41), reported more days of fatigue than their respective matches (see Tables 5 and 6).
Significant differences were also evident between
patients at the 6-month assessment and nonpatients
in ratings of most fatigue (see Table 3). Similar to the
4-month assessment, patients provided lower ratings
than nonpatients of their level of fatigue on the day
they felt most fatigued in the past week (P 5 .01).
Although there was a mean difference in most fatigue, there was no difference (P 5 1.00) in the percentages of patients and nonpatients scoring in the
abnormal range on this measure (see Table 4). Additional analyses indicated that RT patients (P 5 .05),
but not CT 1 RT patients (P 5 .13), provided lower
ratings of most fatigue than their respective matches
(see Tables 5 and 6).

DISCUSSION
The present study yielded 3 major findings. First, the
results clearly showed that the degree of fatigue
experienced by patients at the completion of adjuvant therapy was greater than that experienced by
women with no history of cancer. These differences
were present for both treatment subgroups and
appeared to be clinically meaningful. Second, results
showed that the differences between patients and
comparison subjects evident at the end of treatment
tended to diminish over time. However, even at the
6-month follow-up assessment a statistically significant and clinically meaningful group difference in fatigue duration was still evident. Third, the results
consistently showed that the diminishment in fatigue
over time varied as a function of treatment subgroup,

1857

with greater fatigue evident only among women treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy relative to comparison subjects. These latter findings are
consistent with several previous studies showing
that, among women with breast cancer, posttreatment fatigue is greater in those treated with adjuvant
chemotherapy than in those not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.18,19
Contrary to expectations, nonpatients’ ratings of
most fatigue in the past week were greater than
patients’ ratings at the 4-month and 6-month assessments. It should be noted, however, that neither difference appeared to be clinically meaningful. One
possible explanation for this pattern is that a
‘‘response shift’’ occurred in patients’ perceptions of
fatigue. Response shift has been defined as a change
in internal standards brought about by a change in
health status.24 In the context of cancer treatment,
response shift may represent an adaptive response to
aversive symptoms.25 As patients try to deal with
treatment side effects, changes in internal standards
may occur such that perceptions of symptom severity are attenuated. Evidence for response shift
includes 2 previous studies that demonstrated
changes in internal standards for fatigue among
breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.26,27
With regard to the current study, the results suggest
that patients’ recalibrated their standards for the
most fatigue they had ever experienced upward as a
consequence of undergoing cancer treatment. This
recalibration would explain why their ratings of
greatest fatigue in the posttreatment period were
generally lower than those of individuals who had
never experienced cancer-related fatigue.
The reasons why differences were consistently
evident in the posttreatment period on a measure of
fatigue duration and not on measures of fatigue severity or interference are not entirely clear. One possibility mentioned already in another context is that
certain methods of assessing fatigue may be more
susceptible to response shift than others. Specifically,
measures rated along highly subjective dimensions
(ie, perceived severity and perceived interference)
may be more susceptible to changes over time in internal standards than measures rated along less subjective dimensions (ie, estimating number of days
fatigued). Regardless of the explanation, the present
study demonstrates the value of conducting a multidimensional assessment of fatigue given the differential pattern of results.
Although the present study addressed several
methodological shortcomings of prior studies, several
limitations were still present. First, attrition among
patients was related to several demographic factors

and to receipt of chemotherapy plus radiation. The
potential exists that the current results could be biased by this selective attrition. Second, despite
matching procedures, the survivor sample was significantly younger than the noncancer sample. Inclusion of age as a covariate in comparisons of the 2
samples was used to address this limitation. Third,
the study included patients who received 2 different
forms of adjuvant treatment. However, sufficient
numbers of participants were enrolled to allow
meaningful statistical comparisons of each treatment
subgroup with their respective matches. Indeed,
these comparisons revealed interesting findings
showing persistence of fatigue in 1 treatment subgroup and not the other. Fourth, the samples
reflected little racial diversity. Accordingly, the results
may not be generalizable to minority women with
breast cancer. Fifth, patients were followed for only 6
months after treatment completion. The possibility
that fatigue present at the 6-month assessment
would still be evident at later points in time is
unknown.
Finally, the present study did not address the
issue of why patients treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy were still experiencing more
days of fatigue 6 months after completing treatment
relative to a noncancer comparison group. Other
lines of research suggest that behavioral and/or biological mechanisms may be responsible. With regard
to behavioral mechanisms, there is evidence that
breast cancer patients exercising less and engaging
in more catastrophic coping about fatigue at the end
of treatment are more likely to report heightened fatigue over the next 6 months.28 Additional evidence
for the role of exercise includes research demonstrating the benefits of exercise in improving fatigue
among breast cancer survivors.29 With regard to biological mechanisms, there is evidence that, among
breast cancer survivors who were at least 1 year postdiagnosis and had completed adjuvant therapy, those
who were fatigued show higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine activity than those who were not
fatigued.30,31 Findings from the current study suggest
that future research focus on breast cancer patients
experiencing heightened fatigue during adjuvant
chemotherapy and explore whether interventions
administered during or at the end of treatment are
effective in preventing or limiting fatigue in the posttreatment period. Future research should also examine how intervention efforts could be targeted based
on the identification of behavioral and biological risk
factors for persistent fatigue in the posttreatment
period.
