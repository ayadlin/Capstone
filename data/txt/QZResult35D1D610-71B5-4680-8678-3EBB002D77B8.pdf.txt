BACKGROUND: The authors performed a phase 2 trial of combined protracted daily temozolomide and biweekly
bevacizumab for patients with recurrent glioblastoma who had previously received radiation therapy and temozolomide. METHODS: There was no limit on the number of previous disease progressions or previous regimens allowed.
Thirty-two adult patients were enrolled. Patients received temozolomide 50 mg/m2 daily and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg
intravenously every 14 days. Patients underwent physical examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging every 8
weeks. RESULTS: The authors observed a 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 18.8% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 7.6%-33.7%) and a median PFS of 15.8 weeks. The median overall survival (OS) was 37 weeks, the 6month OS rate was 62.5% (95% CI, 43.5%-76.7%), and the 12-month OS rate was 31.3% (95% CI, 16.4%-47.3%). Nine
patients (28%) had a radiographic response, and 7 patients (22%) had disease progression within the first 8 weeks of
treatment. Patterns of progression were available for 21 patients. The authors observed that 52% of patients (n ¼ 11)
progressed locally, 38% (n ¼ 8) progressed with a diffuse pattern, and 10% (n ¼ 2) progressed at a distant site. Two
patients discontinued therapy secondary to toxicity (prolonged thrombocytopenia and grade 4 pancreatitis). One
patient experienced grade 5 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that a regimen of combined daily temozolomide and biweekly bevacizumab had some activity and was well tolerated. However, the results
obtained in this study were inferior to those observed in studies of bevacizumab monotherapy and of combined irinotecan and bevacizumab therapy. The current patient population was more heterogeneous and was pretreated

INTRODUCTION
The prognosis for patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) is poor, with a median survival of approximately 6
months.1-3 Clinical trials of single-agent or combination chemotherapy in this patient population have yielded response
rates of 5% to 20%.4-10 With advances in cancer biology and an understanding of growth factor pathways, clinical trials of
growth factor inhibitors have been performed, but the results have been disappointing, and no improvements have been
observed in response rates or survival.11-15
The standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed GBM is surgery, followed by radiation therapy and daily
temozolomide, followed by 6 monthly cycles of 5-day temozolomide.16 Patients with a methylated promoter of methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) benefit most from the addition of temozolomide to radiation therapy.17 Approximately 40% of patients with GBM have a methylated promoter.18-20 One potential way to overcome an unmethylated
promoter is the use of protracted daily temozolomide to deplete MGMT and sensitize tumor cells to temozolomide. Studies have demonstrated that protracted temozolomide schedules deplete MGMT activity in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells.21 Such MGMT depletion has not been demonstrated in actual tumor cells but offers the possibility of reversing
temozolomide resistance and restoring chemosensitivity, thereby producing cytotoxic damage in previously resistant
GBM.
The use of low-dose chemotherapy delivered on a continuous basis also may induce an antiangiogenic effect.22
Lower daily doses of chemotherapeutic agents inhibit endothelial cell recovery and also restrict the mobilization and

activity of bone marrow-derived, circulating endothelial
precursors, thus contributing to antiangiogenic activity.23
A final argument for the use of protracted daily temozolomide is the dose intensity obtained. The conventional 5day temozolomide regimen delivers from 750 mg/m2 to
1000 mg/m2 per month. In contrast, protracted temozolomide at 50 mg/m2 daily, which was used in the current
study, offers a dose intensity of 1400 mg/m2 per 28-day
period, which represents 1.4 to 1.9 more temozolomide
than is obtained with the conventional 5-day temozolomide regimen. In a trial among patients with recurrent
GBM who progressed after 5-day temozolomide, 15% of
patients benefited from daily temozolomide.24
It is well recognized that vascular proliferation is a
histopathologic hallmark of GBM.25,26 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is overexpressed in GBM.
VEGF levels correlate directly with tumor vascularity and
grade and inversely with prognosis.27-30 Bevacizumab, a
humanized murine monoclonal antibody binding VEGFA,31,32 prevents the interaction and activation of VEGF
receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.33 Bevacizumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy has
demonstrated substantial activity against recurrent
GBM,34,35 which led to its accelerated approval in May
2009 for this patient population. Here, we report the
results from a phase 2 trial of the combination of protracted daily temozolomide and biweekly bevacizumab in
patients with recurrent GBM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Adult patients were eligible if they had a histologically
documented GBM, had received prior daily temozolomide and radiation therapy followed by 5-day temozolomide at some time before enrollment and had progressive,
measurable disease documented on magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). Patients also were required to have the
following measurements and conditions: a Karnofsky performance status 60%; adequate hematologic function
(an absolute neutrophil count 1500/lL and a platelet
count >125,000/mm3) and organ function (creatinine
<1.5 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin
<1.5 times the normal); at least 4 weeks from any major
surgery or 1 week from minor surgery, including a stereotactic brain biopsy; at least 4 weeks from completion of
radiation therapy; absence of acute hemorrhage on MRI;
and absence of progression on daily temozolomide. There
was no limit to the number of previous disease progres-

sions or treatment regimens. Previous exposure to or even
failure on bevacizumab was allowed. Contraceptive measures were required for sexually active patients. The protocol was approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration and the Duke University Institutional
Review Board. Each patient provided informed consent.
Treatment
Patients received temozolomide 50 mg/m2 daily and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. Each
cycle was 4 weeks long, and patients underwent physical
examination and brain MRI every 8 weeks. A complete
blood count with differential was obtained weekly, blood
pressure was checked every 2 weeks before the infusion of
bevacizumab, and a complete metabolic panel and urinalysis or protein:creatinine ratio was obtained every 4 weeks.
Treatment was suspended in instances of attributable
grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity or grade 4 hematologic toxicity. Treatment was restarted when toxicity
resolved. Patients continued on treatment until one of the
following events occurred: documented tumor progression, grade 2 central nervous system hemorrhage, grade
4 nonhematologic toxicity, voluntary withdrawal, or
noncompliance with study guidelines. Patients did not
receive prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.
Radiographic Evaluation
Patients underwent baseline MRI within 2 weeks before
starting therapy and after every 2 cycles (8 weeks) on trial.
MRI was done with a study-specific brain tumor protocol
that included axial T1, T2, fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion weighted imaging, apparent
diffusion coefficient, sagittal T1 and postcontrast axial
and coronal images.
Response Determination
Two investigators (A.D. and J.J.V.) independently
reviewed every MRI study obtained for each patient on
study and measured the postcontrast enhancing lesions
using the modified criteria described by Macdonald et
al36 to assess response, incorporating corticosteroid doses
and clinical status. In addition, the investigators reviewed
the nonenhancing tumor.
A complete response was defined as the resolution of
all enhancing, T2, and FLAIR abnormalities; the need for
no greater than physiologic corticosteroid dose (defined as
2 mg of dexamethasone daily); and the absence of neurologic decline. A partial response was defined as a reduction 50% in the cross-sectional area of the enhancing

tumor, the absence of an increase in T2 or FLAIR abnormalities, a stable or decreased corticosteroid dose, and the
absence of neurologic decline. Stable disease status was
determined for tumors with a cross-sectional area of
enhancing tumor reduced by <50% or increased by
<25%, T2 or FLAIR abnormalities increased by <25%,
and the absence of neurologic decline. MRI studies were
interpreted as progressive disease if an increase >25% in
the cross-sectional area of the enhancing tumor was
observed, a worsening >25% in T2 or FLAIR signal
abnormalities with stable or increased steroid requirement
was determined, and/or neurologic decline secondary to
the tumor was present.
MGMT Protein Expression by
Immunohistochemistry
The expression of MGMT protein was determined by
immunohistochemistry.37,38 With this technique, a low
MGMT level was identified when 20% of tumor cell
nuclei exhibited staining for MGMT. The MGMT protein level was defined as elevated when >20% of the tumor cell nuclei exhibited staining for MGMT.
Statistical Considerations
Among patients with recurrent GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma who were treated on 1 of 8 phase 2 trials conducted at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center, Wong et al1 reported a 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 21% and a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 17% to 26%. Our patient
population was expected to have a poorer prognosis than
the patient population reported by Wong et al; because,
in our study, there were no patients with grade III malignant glioma, and we included a greater percentage of
patients who received previous chemotherapy (100%)
and a greater percentage of patients who had failed 2 or
more treatment regimens (50%). Nonetheless, the data
reported by Wong et al were used as the historic basis for
the design of our current study instead of data on outcomes from bevacizumab-based therapy, because the latter were not available at the time our study was designed.
The hypothesis explored in the current study was chosen
in light of the poorer prognosis for our patient population. Specifically, if the 6-month PFS rate with protracted
daily temozolomide and bevacizumab was 20% (95%
CI, 17%-26%), then there would be interest in further
investigation of this combination. However, if the 6month PFS rate was 5%, then there would be limited
interest in pursuing the development of the treatment reg-

1304

imen for this patient population. With a sample size of 32
patients, the study was designed to differentiate between
6-month PFS rates of 5% and 20% with type I and II
error rates of 0.074 and 0.093, respectively. If 4 of these
32 patients lived for 6 months without disease progression, then the treatment regimen would be considered
worthy of further investigation.
The study was monitored for unacceptable toxicity,
which was defined as grade 2 or worse central nervous system hemorrhage or grade 4 or 5 nonhematologic toxicity
related to treatment. An unacceptable toxicity rate 15%
was considered desirable, whereas rates 40% were considered undesirable. Accrual was not suspended to formally assess toxicity unless guidelines based on a Pocock
boundary used to differentiate between a 15% to 40%
rate of unacceptable toxicity were satisfied. These guidelines were not adjusted for differential length of patient
follow-up. Type I and II error rates were 0.05 and 0.19,
respectively. Whenever a treatment-related toxic death
occurred, all data were carefully reviewed to determine
whether the study should be terminated prematurely.
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the start
of study treatment to date of death or the date of last follow-up if censored, whereas PFS was defined as the time
between treatment initiation and disease progression,
death, or last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier methods were
used to estimate median, 6-month, and 12-month survival. The log-rank test was used to test for differences in
survival for patients who progressed on 5-day temozolomide before enrollment versus patients who did not, for
patients who enrolled >6 months after disease progression on 5-day temozolomide compared with those who
enrolled <6 months after disease progression on 5-day
temozolomide, for patients on dexamethasone versus
those off dexamethasone at enrollment, and for patients
with low MGMT expression versus those with increased
MGMT expression. Survival analysis was performed
using the SAS software package (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Demographics
From July 18, 2007, to October 3, 2007, 32 patients with
recurrent GBM were enrolled. Fifty-nine percent of
patients were men, and the median age was 56 years
(range, 25-80 years). Fifty-six percent of the patients had
a Karnofsky performance status of 90% at the time of
enrollment. Seventeen patients (53%) had experienced 2

or more progressions at enrollment. Twenty-five patients
(78%) had received 2 or more prior treatment regimens
before enrollment (range, 2-5 prior regimens; median, 2
prior regimens). Twenty patients (62%) had progressed
on 5-day temozolomide, and 15 of those patients were
within 6 months of study enrollment. Four patients
(12%) had received bevacizumab before enrollment on
study; of these 4, 2 patients experienced disease progression while on bevacizumab, and 2 patients developed
recurrent disease while being monitored off therapy after
completing a successful course of treatment for 12 months
with bevacizumab. The 2 patients had been monitored off
therapy for 4 months and 16 months, respectively, before
enrolling on study. Two additional patients (6%) had
progressed on a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor
directed to VEGFR before enrollment on study. Of the
32 patients, 2 patients (6%) were enrolled <12 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy. One patient was
enrolled after 9 weeks, and the second patient was enrolled
10 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy.
Patients’ characteristics are outlined in Table 1.
Progression-Free Survival
The 6-month PFS rate for the whole population was
18.8% (95% CI, 7.6%-33.7%), and the 12-month PFS
rate was 6.3% (95% CI, 1.1%-18.1%). The median PFS
was 15.8 weeks (Table 2). A Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS is
provided in Figure 1. There was no statistically significant
difference in PFS for patients who progressed on 5-day
temozolomide before enrollment compared with those
who did not (P ¼ .3), as indicated in Table 2. Table 2 also
indicates that there was no difference in PFS among
patients who enrolled >6 months after disease progression on 5-day temozolomide compared with those who
enrolled <6 months after disease progression on 5-day
temozolomide (P ¼ .1). Patients who were not receiving
dexamethasone at enrollment had significantly longer
PFS than those who were receiving dexamethasone (P ¼
.03): The 6-month PFS rates were 31.3% (95% CI,
11.4%-53.6%) versus 6.3% (95% CI, 0.4%-24.7%),
respectively; and the median PFS was 16.4 weeks (95%
CI, 15.1-30 weeks) versus 7.9 weeks (95% CI, 4.7-15.9
weeks), respectively.
Overall Survival
The 6-month OS rate was 62.5% (95% CI, 43.5%76.7%), and the 12-month OS rate was 31.3% (95% CI,
16.4%-47.3%). The median OS was 37.1 weeks (Table
2). A Kaplan-Meier curve of OS is provided in Figure 1.

MGMT Protein Expression by
Immunohistochemistry
MGMT status was determined for 21 patients using
immunohistochemistry, which indicated that 13 patients
(62%) had low MGMT levels, and 8 patients (38%) had
elevated MGMT levels. Median PFS, 6-month PFS, median OS, and 6-month OS did not differ statistically
when MGMT protein levels were taken into consideration (see Table 2).
Response Rate
There were no complete responses. Nine (28%) partial
responses were observed; and, in most of these patients (n
¼ 7), the partial response was observed by week 8. There
were 16 patients (50%) with stable disease and 7 patients
(22%) with disease progression within the first 8 weeks of
treatment. An example of a partial response is provided in

level, is provided in Figure 3.
Corticosteroid Use
Sixteen patients (50%) were receiving dexamethasone at
the time of enrollment. The median total daily dexamethasone dose was 4 mg (range, 0.75-16 mg). Within the first
4 cycles, 2 patients decreased their dexamethasone dose,
and 3 patients discontinued dexamethasone. Of the 16
patients who were not receiving dexamethasone at study
enrollment, after the first 4 cycles, 12 patients remained
on study without dexamethasone, whereas 2 patients
required dexamethasone initiation because of progressive
neurologic symptoms.
Toxicity
The regimen was well tolerated, and 2 patients discontinued therapy secondary to toxicity (prolonged thrombocytopenia and grade 4 pancreatitis). It is noteworthy that the
patient who discontinued therapy secondary to prolonged
thrombocytopenia has remained progression free after
40 months. Grade 3 toxicities included 3 patients who
experienced grade 3 fatigue and 7 patients each with a single symptom of diarrhea, dehydration, hemorrhoids,
dyspnea, hypertension, colitis, and hyperglycemia. One
patient experienced grade 5 pneumonia. All toxicities are
listed in Table 4. The patient who died from pneumonia
was diagnosed with a fungal pneumonia (Candida species), and the family opted to withdraw support because

of poor clinical status. This patient was the only treatment-associated death. One patient had grade 2 wound
dehiscence (1 of his stretch marks displayed a small opening), but bevacizumab was not withheld for this.

DISCUSSION
We performed a phase 2 trial of protracted daily temozolomide and biweekly bevacizumab and observed a 6month PFS rate of 18.8%. The regimen was well tolerated, with 1 grade 4 event and 1 treatment-related death.
The inclusion of bevacizumab in the treatment of
recurrent GBM has produced improved response rates,
PFS, and OS compared with historic controls, but it also
has raised new issues, including radiographic response
assessment, determination of disease progression, and lack
of effective therapies once a patient has failed VEGFdirected therapies.15,34,35,40-42 Determining the most
effective therapy for patients with recurrent GBM remains
a daily goal for neuro-oncologists. It remains unclear
whether benefit is gained by the addition of chemotherapy
to bevacizumab for patients with recurrent GBM.34 In
our current study, the combination of daily temozolomide and biweekly bevacizumab was well tolerated, but
the 6-month PFS appeared to be inferior to that of bevacizumab alone and to the combination of irinotecan and
bevacizumab.34,35 One possible explanation for the inferiority of our study outcome compared with single-agent
bevacizumab may be that our study population was more
heavily pretreated. In the Bevacizumab Alone or in Combination With Irinotecan for Treatment of GBM
(BRAIN) study,34 81.2% of patients who received bevacizumab monotherapy were enrolled at first progression,
and 18.8% were enrolled at second progression. By comparison, in our study, 53% of patients enrolled after 2
progressions, and 78% of patients had received 2 previous treatment regimens (range, 2-5 previous treatment
regimens). In addition, 4 patients had previously received
bevacizumab. Two patients enrolled on the study after
experiencing disease progression on bevacizumab. The 2
other patients had discontinued bevacizumab for 4
months and 16 months, respectively, and were being
monitored off therapy at the time of recurrence. Furthermore, 2 patients enrolled on our study after experiencing
disease progression on a small-molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitor directed to VEGFR. Not enrolling these 6
patients may have allowed a better outcome.
Despite extensive controversies concerning the usefulness of irinotecan in patients with recurrent

protracted daily dosing schedule of temozolomide used in
our study was not optimal and, thus, may explain the inferiority of our results compared with those from irinotecan
and bevacizumab. Several studies have evaluated temozo-

studies were initiated before temozolomide became the
standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM and, thus,
were performed in temozolomide-naive patients with
recurrent GBM.44-47 However, studies evaluating patients
once they failed 5-day temozolomide have been published
recently. Abacioglu et al48 evaluated dose-dense temozolomide therapy administered at 100 mg/m2 for 21

consecutive days of a 28-day cycle, and Wick et al49 studied temozolomide at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on days 1
through 7 and days 15 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. Six-month
PFS rates of 25% and 43.8% were observed by Abacioglu
et al and Wick et al,48,49 respectively, for the GBM patient
subgroups of their studies. Kong et al50 and Perry
et al24,51 treated patients with recurrent GBM at the same
protracted daily temozolomide dose that we used in our
current study. Kong et al50 observed a 6-month PFS rate
of 32.5%, and Perry et al24,51 observed a 6-month PFS
rate of 23.9%. The lower 6-month PFS in our study probably was secondary to the more severe disease status of our
study population compared with the disease status of the
populations in the studies mentioned above.24,48-51 Fiftythree percent of our patients enrolled on study after 2
prior progressions, and 78% enrolled after receiving 2
prior treatment regimens (range, 2-5 prior treatment regimens). Comparatively, in the studies mentioned above,
100% of patients were treated at first recurrence except
for 2 of 64 patients (3%) in the trial by Wick et al.49
One potential goal of protracted daily temozolomide is to deplete MGMT and sensitize tumor cells to
temozolomide. In our study, there was no evidence of a
difference in OS or PFS when we compared patients who

1310

had low MGMT levels with patients who had elevated
MGMT levels. Reviewing these data does not allow us to
reach meaningful conclusions concerning the impact of
MGMT and most likely reflects the small number of
patients for which MGMT expression status was known.
It is also unclear whether immunohistochemistry represents a reliable strategy for assessing MGMT compared
with other techniques, including promoter methylation
status or functional activity assessment.52 Finally, the use
of archival tumor material to assess MGMT, which was
derived from tumor samples obtained from original, pretreatment, surgical specimens, may not have reflected tumor MGMT content at study enrollment. However,
Wick et al49 and Kong et al50 also described the absence of
significant PFS and OS differences with regard to the
methylation status of the MGMT promoter in their respective studies. In both studies, MGMT promoter methylation status was analyzed by methylation-specific
polymerase chain reaction.49,50
The patterns of recurrence observed in our patient
population were similar to those observed by others. In
the BRAIN study, Pope et al39 observed that 77% of
patients who had localized disease at enrollment had local
progression at the time of bevacizumab with or without
irinotecan failure, and 23% had a diffuse pattern of progression. Similar patterns of recurrence have been
observed by others.40,41,53 This diffuse pattern of progression is often nonenhancing, which makes adherence to
the new radiographic criteria defined by the Response
Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group a necessity in the current era of antiangiogenic therapies.42
To our knowledge, only 1 other clinical trial of protracted daily temozolomide in combination with bevacizumab has been published to date. Verhoeff et al54
administered protracted daily temozolomide at 50 mg/m2
daily in combination with bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg
intravenously every 21 days. One cycle was defined as 21
days. In that study, 23 patients with histologically confirmed malignant glioma were enrolled, including 8
patients who had a diagnosis of grade III malignant glioma and 15 patients with GBM. All patients previously
underwent tumor resection followed by radiation therapy
and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide and were
progressive after first-line or second-line therapy. A 6month PFS rate of 6.7%, a median PFS of 10.4 weeks,
and a median OS of 15.7 weeks were observed for the 15
patients with GBM. Four patients (17%) acquired new
contrast-enhancing lesions in other parts of the brain during treatment; and all others had local recurrences

observed on MRI.54 Our patient population compares
favorably to the results reported by Verhoeff et al.54
Bevacizumab and possibly other inhibitors of
VEGF appear to have clinically meaningful activity in
recurrent GBM. In this trial, we demonstrated that
combined therapy with daily temozolomide and
biweekly bevacizumab has some activity and is well
tolerated. However, the results obtained in this study
are inferior to those observed in studies of bevacizumab monotherapy and of combined therapy with irinotecan and bevacizumab. The interpretation of our
survival results is difficult, because our patient population was very heterogeneous; some patients had failed
5-day temozolomide and/or bevacizumab or other
VEGF-directed therapies before enrollment, whereas
others had not. Also, our patients were heavily pretreated compared with the patients in previous studies.
The challenge to further improve the survival of
patients with recurrent GBM will have to focus on
the optimal use of VEGF inhibitors, the development
of synergistic combinations, the development of clinical trials stratifying patients according whether they
received prior VEGF-directed therapies, and a better
understanding of the mechanisms of VEGF resistance.
