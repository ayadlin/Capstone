Abstract
Blood and lymphatic vasculature are essential components of
all organs, responsible for maintaining organ fluid dynamics
and tissue homeostasis. Although both vessel systems are
composed of similar lineages of endothelial cells whose crude
functions include fluid and cell transport, each system also
possesses distinctive physiologic properties, enabling their
distinctive functions in tissues. The role of hematogenous
vasculature and development of angiogenic blood vessels
during cancer development is well established; however, the
role of lymphangiogenesis and structural/functional alterations occurring within lymphatic vessels during cancer
development are incompletely understood. To assess premalignant versus malignant alterations in blood and lymphatic
vasculature associated with squamous epithelial skin carcinogenesis, we assessed architectural and functional features
of both vascular systems using a mouse model of de novo
carcinoma development. We report that, as vasculature
acquires angiogenic and/or lymphangiogenic properties,
angiogenic blood vessels become leaky in premalignant tissue
and at peripheries of carcinomas, where enlarged lymphatic
capillaries efficiently drain increased tissue fluid, thereby
maintaining tissue hemodynamics. In contrast, central regions
of carcinomas exhibit elevated tissue fluid levels, compressed
lymphatic lumina, and decreased vascular leakage, thus
indicating impaired hemodynamics within solid tumors.
Together, these data support the notion that therapeutic
delivery of anticancer agents is best realized in premalignant
tissues and/or at the peripheries of solid tumors where
hemodynamic forces support drug delivery. Strategies to
normalize intratumoral hemodynamics would therefore
enhance therapeutic delivery to otherwise poorly accessible
central regions of solid tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5211–20]

Introduction
Blood and lymphatic vessels comprise two interdependent
vascular networks in all tissues. Whereas blood vessels deliver
blood cells, plasma proteins, and oxygen to tissues, lymphatics,
composed of lymph-forming capillaries and collecting vessels,
continually regulate interstitial fluid pressure by draining interstitial fluid and debris to maintain tissue homeostasis. When tissues
are acutely damaged, activation of both vascular systems occurs as

part of innate repair programs; once complete, both systems return
to their homeostatic states. In contrast, sustained activation of one
or both vascular networks is associated with some chronic
disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (1) and psoriasis (2, 3),
and contributes to disease pathogenesis. Cancer development is
similarly associated with chronic activation of blood vasculature
(i.e., angiogenesis) in premalignant and malignant tissues (4).
Activation of angiogenic vasculature in premalignant tissue is
characterized by increased proliferation of vascular endothelial cells
(VEC) and sprouting of new immature leaky blood vessels from
preexisting vascular beds (5). Increased leakage of plasma proteins
from immature angiogenic vessels leads to increased interstitial
fluid content, lymph formation, and drainage via lymphatic vessels
back into the blood circulation (6). High interstitial fluid pressure
(IFP), which forms a barrier to transcapillary transport, results in
inefficient delivery of therapeutic drugs from vasculature into
tumor stroma (7). It has been postulated that high IFP, common to
many solid tumors, is in part a result of inefficient clearance of
tissue fluid by lymphatic vessels (7). This postulate is supported by
histochemical studies evaluating lymphatic architecture and
diminished lumen diameters in archival human carcinomas and
murine xenograft tumors (8–12). Studies evaluating functional
changes in the status of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and/or
lymphatic vessels compared with VECs and blood vessels in
premalignant tissues have not been well described.
To critically examine distinctive versus common physiologic and
functional properties of blood versus lymphatic vasculature that
accompany and/or contribute to cancer development, we used a
transgenic mouse model of de novo epithelial squamous cell
carcinogenesis (e.g., K14-HPV16 mice; ref. 13). HPV16 mice progress
through well-defined premalignant stages before de novo carcinoma
development, mirroring histopathologic stages observed during
human cervical carcinogenesis (14). HPV16 mice develop hyperplastic skin lesions with 100% penetrance by 1 month of age that
focally progress to dysplasia by 3 to 6 months (13). Precursor
dysplasias undergo malignant conversion into varying grades of
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in skin in 50% of mice that metastasize to regional lymph nodes with a 30% frequency (13, 15).
Angiogenic vasculature is first evident in premalignant hyperplasias,
development of which is linked to infiltration of innate immune cells
(e.g., mast cells, granulocytes, and macrophages; refs. 15–18). Using
this model, we assessed molecular, histopathologic, and functional
variables of blood and lymphatic vasculature to reveal their distinctive physiologic properties at each stage of neoplastic development.

Cancer Research
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee procedures. HPV16
transgenic mice (19), preparation of tissue sections (ear skin) for histologic
examination, and characterization of neoplastic stages based on H&E
histopathology and cytokeratin intermediate filament expression have been
described previously (13, 15, 20). Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were
fixed by immersion in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated through
graded ethanol and xylenes, embedded in paraffin, cut with a Leica 2135
microtome into 5-Am-thick sections, and histopathologically examined
following H&E staining and immunoreactivity of keratin intermediate
filaments. Hyperplastic lesions were identified by a 2-fold increase in
epidermal thickness and an intact granular cell layer with keratohyalin
granules. Dysplastic lesions were characterized based on basal and spinous
cell layers with hyperchromatic nuclei representing greater than half of
the total epidermal thickness and incomplete terminal differentiation of
keratinocytes. SCC was identified by abundance of abnormal mitotic figures
and an invasive loss of integrity in epithelial basement membrane with
clear development of malignant cell clusters proliferating in the dermis.
SCCs were graded as has been described previously (17).

Flow Cytometry
Single cell suspensions were prepared from ear (n = 4) and tumor (n = 7)
tissue as described previously (21). Cells were incubated for 10 min at
4jC with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 monoclonal antibody (mAb; BD
Biosciences) at a 1:200 dilution in PBS/bovine serum albumin (BSA) to
prevent nonspecific antibody binding. Subsequently, cells were washed and
incubated for 20 min with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD31
(1:200; eBioscience) and anti-mouse podoplanin hybridoma supernatant
(mAb clone 8.1.1, 1:1000; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,
University of Iowa). Cells were washed twice with PBS/BSA and incubated
with Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated anti-hamster antibody (1:1,000; Molecular
Probes) for 20 min. After two washes with PBS/BSA, 7-aminoactinomycin D
(1:10; BD Biosciences) was added to discriminate between viable and dead
cells. Data acquisition was done on a FACSCalibur using CellQuestPro
software (BD Biosciences), and data analysis was done using FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Inc.). Data shown represent the mean F SE. P values of
<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
Tissue sections were deparaffinized, briefly washed in PBS, and blocked
for 15 min in blocking buffer (5.0% normal goat serum/2.5% BSA/PBS).
Primary antibodies were diluted in 0.5 blocking buffer: rat antimouse CD31 (1:50; PharMingen), Syrian hamster anti-mouse podoplanin
(1:200, clone 8.1.1; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of
Iowa), guinea pig anti-mouse cytokeratin pan (1:100; Progen Biotechnik
GmbH), and rabbit anti-mouse lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1
(LYVE-1; 1:200; Upstate). Sections were incubated with primary antibody
overnight at 4jC in a humidified chamber followed by three brief washes in
PBS and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor
488–conjugated anti-rat antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes), Alexa Fluor
633–conjugated anti-guinea pig antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes), Alexa
Fluor 594–conjugated anti-hamster antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes), or
Alexa Fluor 594/488–conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:500; Molecular
Probes) for 2.0 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. After five
3-min washes in PBS, the fluorescently stained sections were mounted in
ProLong Gold mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was
visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope LSM510 META (Carl
Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) and analyzed with Zeiss LSM Image Examiner.
Ear tissue (n = 4/time point) and tumor tissue (n = 5) were assessed for
lymphatic luminal status and blood and lymphatic vessel density by
counting the number of vessels in five random high-power fields of vision
per time point per tissue, tumor center, and periphery.
Immunohistochemical detection of proliferating endothelial cells.
Fresh bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma) suspended in water (1.0 mg/mL)
was given to mice in drinking water ad libitum and changed every 2nd day
for a total of 8 days. For fluorescent angiography, animals were tail vein
injected with FITC-conjugated Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin
(2.0 mg/mL; Vector Laboratories) 3.0 min before cardiac perfusion with the

following reagents in chronological order: 15 mL of 1% paraformaldehyde/
0.5% glutaraldehyde, 7.0 mL PBS, 15 mL PBS containing 1.0% BSA, and
15 mL of 4.0% paraformaldehyde at a constant flow rate of 7.0 mL/min.
Tissue was harvested and fixed in 10% zinc-buffered formalin for 8 to 16 h at
4jC before further processing followed by dehydration through graded
alcohols and xylene and embedding in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5 Am
thick) were cut using a Leica 2135 microtome. Blood vasculature was
detected by fluorescent angiography (22), and immunohistochemical
analysis was done detecting lymphatic vessels (LYVE-1 reactivity), keratinexpressing epithelial cells (pan-keratin reactivity), proliferating nuclei
(BrdUrd incorporation), and all nuclei as follows: Sections were deparaffinized, incubated in 2.0 N HCl for 1.0 h at room temperature, rinsed in PBS,
and blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer (5.0% normal goat serum/2.5%
BSA/PBS). Primary antibodies were diluted in 0.5 blocking buffer: guinea
pig anti-mouse cytokeratin pan (1:100), biotinylated anti-BrdUrd (1:50; clone
Br-3; Caltag), and rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 (1:200). Sections were
incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4jC followed by three brief
washes in PBS and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies
(all 1:500; Molecular Probes) Alexa Fluor 633–conjugated anti-guinea pig
antibody, Alexa Fluor 546-streptavidin–conjugated antibody, and Alexa
Fluor 594–conjugated anti-rabbit antibody for 2.0 h at room temperature in
a humidified chamber. After five 3-min washes in PBS, the fluorescently
stained sections were subjected to a nuclear staining with SYTO62
(0.7 Amol/L in H2O; Molecular Probes) for 10 min and then mounted in
ProLong Gold mounting medium. Fluorescence was visualized using a laser
scanning confocal microscope LSM510 META and analyzed with a Zeiss
LSM Image Examiner. A minimum of 100 endothelial cell nuclei in control
(n = 4), premalignant ear (n = 4), and tumor tissue (n = 7) was identified in
tissue sections based on their morphologic protrusion into the vessel
lumen, and the percentage of proliferating nuclei was determined.

Fluorescent Angiography and Immunohistochemistry of
Whole-Mount Ear Tissue and Thick Frozen Tumor Sections
Whole-mounted ear tissue (n = 3 per time point) was prepared as
described previously (23). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a 2%
isofluorane/98% oxygen mixture and 100 AL of FITC-conjugated L.
esculentum (tomato) lectin (2.0 mg/mL) were injected into the tail vein
and allowed to circulate for 3.0 min followed by cardiac perfusion with
35 mL of PBS-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4; ref. 22). Ears were
harvested, ventral and dorsal aspects were separated, and cartilage was
removed from ventral aspects, which were then immersion fixed in PBSbuffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) overnight at 4jC and subjected to
the following staining procedure under exclusion of light: Ventral aspects
of ears were rinsed briefly in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and
blocked in PBS-T containing 3% goat serum overnight at 4jC. Tissue was
subsequently incubated with primary rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 antibody
(1:2,000; Upstate) diluted in PBS-T over two nights at 4jC. After five washes
in PBS-T (5–10 min each) and a 2- to 3-h blocking incubation with PBS-T
containing 3% goat serum at 4jC, tissue was incubated overnight at 4jC
with a Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:500; Molecular
Probes). Tissue was then washed 10 times for 5 min at 4jC and mounted in
ProLong Gold mounting medium.
Tumors (n = 5) were dissected, flash frozen in OCT compound, and cut
into 200 Am sections and subsequently rinsed briefly in PBS-T and blocked
in PBS-T containing 3% goat serum for 2.0 h at room temperature. Tissue
was subsequently incubated with primary rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1
antibody (1:2,000) diluted in PBS-T overnight at 4jC. After three 3-min
washes in PBS-T, tissue was incubated for 3 h at room temperature with
Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:500). After three 3-min
washes in PBS-T, tissue was mounted in ProLong Gold mounting medium.
Fluorescence was visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope
LSM510 META and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM Image Examiner (Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging).

Intravital Perfusion of Lymphatics
Intravital perfusion of lymphatics was modified from what has been
described by Nagy et al. (24). Mice were anesthetized with a 2% isofluorane/
98% oxygen mixture and cradled in a transparent acrylic resin mold

(Syndicate Sales, Inc.). Ears (n = 6 per time point) were mounted flat on a
resin support, held in place by silicone vacuum grease, and viewed in a
dissecting microscope (Olympus). Colloidal carbon (Higgins non-waterproof
black drawing ink; Sanford) was diluted 1:1 in PBS, filtered through a
0.22-Am filter, and injected i.d. through a prepulled borosilicate glass
micropipette with an inner diameter of 1.0 Am (World Precision
Instruments) attached to a 100 AL Hamilton syringe (World Precision
Instruments). The micropipette was repeatedly injected into the dermis of
the peripheral ear until a lymphatic vessel was entered. Colloidal carbon
was then slowly injected. For lymphatic vessel diameter analysis, ear tissue
(n = 3 per time point) was subsequently harvested and fixed overnight in
acetone at 4jC. After fixation, the tissue was cleared in toluene 48 h at room
temperature and mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific). For photography,

a digital camera (Nikon Coolpix 950) was used and the images were
analyzed using Openlab software (Improvision). For in vivo analysis of
colloidal carbon clearance, images were captured using a LUMAR
microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) within 1.0 min of injection and
again after 20 min. Both ears of negative littermate ( LM) and 4-month

blue dye was allowed to circulate for 30 min. Anesthetized mice were
subsequently cardiac perfused with 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.05 mol/L
citrate buffer (pH 3.5). Ears (n = 6 per time point; n = 3 per mineral oil/
mustard oil treatment) were removed, blotted dry, and weighed. Tumors
(n = 4) were dissected and cut into seven pieces representing six
peripheral sections and center. Premalignant nontumor tissue was derived
from neck, chest, and abdomen of non–tumor-bearing HPV16 animals.
Evans blue dye was extracted from ears, nontumor tissue, and tumor
pieces in 1.0 mL formamide for 48 h at 60jC and measured spectrophotometrically at 610 nm in a SpectraMax 340 (Molecular Devices). Data

Tissue Fluid Determination
Mice were euthanized, and ears (n = 6 per time point) and/or tumors
(n = 4) were removed and weighed (wet weight). Tumors were dissected into
six peripheral sections and tumor centers. Premalignant nontumor tissue
was derived from neck, chest, and abdomen of non–tumor-bearing HPV16
animals. Tissue was snap frozen, lyophilized, and reweighed (dry weight).

Results
Endothelial composition of blood and lymphatic vasculature during neoplastic progression. To evaluate the endothelial
cell composition of premalignant versus malignant tissues (skin)
during squamous carcinogenesis, we determined the relative

percentage of endothelial cells at each stage of neoplastic
progression in HPV16 mice, compared with wild-type negative
littermate ( LM) controls, by assessing expression of the panendothelial cell adhesion molecule CD31 (25), present on both
VECs and LECs, albeit at varying levels of expression (26), using
flow cytometry of single cell suspensions (Fig. 1A). We found a
progressive increase in the relative percentage of CD31+
endothelial cells at each distinct premalignant stage (Fig. 1A).
Carcinomas on the other hand contained a lower percentage
of endothelial cells by comparison with premalignant tissues

(Fig. 1A), although tumor vasculature possessed angiogenic characteristics (16).
To determine the hematogenous versus lymphatic composition
of these endothelial cell populations, we further used flow
cytometry of single cell suspensions and quantitatively examined
endothelial cells expressing CD31 and the mucin-type transmembrane glycoprotein podoplanin (Fig. 1B). Histochemically, podoplanin-positive endothelial cells are also LYVE-1 positive (Fig. 1C)
and thus allow distinction between CD31Hi/podoplanin VECs
from CD31Lo/podoplanin+ LECs. The average difference in CD31
signal intensity between CD31Hi VECs and CD31Lo LECs was
28%. A progressive increase in both VEC and LEC populations was
found during premalignant progression; however, at the tumor
stage, VECs represented a larger proportion of the total CD31+ cells
(Fig. 1B).
To determine the degree to which VECs and LECs exhibited
proliferative behavior at each neoplastic stage, we evaluated
endothelial cell proliferation in blood and lymphatic vessels as a

function of BrdUrd incorporation. BrdUrd analysis of endothelial
cells was limited to vessels with open lumina so as to distinguish
BrdUrd-positive endothelial cells [whose nuclei protrude into
vessel lumina (Fig. 2A)] from BrdUrd-positive mural cells (whose
nuclei protrude toward interstitia). BrdUrd-positive CD31Hi/
LYVE-1 VECs and CD31Lo/LYVE-1+ LECs were not observed in
skin sections of LM mice, reflecting the quiescent nature of
endothelial cells in homeostatic tissue (Fig. 2B). In contrast,
BrdUrd-positive VECs and LECs were readily identified throughout
premalignant progression albeit with distinct profiles (Fig. 2A
and B). Whereas BrdUrd-positive VEC percentages steadily
increased at each distinct premalignant stage (Fig. 2B), percentages
of premalignant BrdUrd-positive LECs remained constant, albeit
higher than in LM skin (Fig. 2B). In carcinomas, open lumen
blood and lymphatic vessels possessed distinct BrdUrd-positive
endothelial cell distributions dependent on (a) SCC grade (lowergrade, well-differentiated SCC-I versus higher-grade, moderatepoorly differentiated SCC-II) and (b) SCC location (tumor center

versus tumor periphery). Open lumen blood and lymphatic vessels
were identified at peripheries of both SCC-I and SCC-II carcinomas
and in centers of SCC-I (Fig. 2A and B). In the center of SCC-IIs,
open lumens were only found in blood vessels and not in lymphatic
vessels (Fig. 2B). Analysis of proliferating endothelial cells in vessels
with open lumens in carcinomas revealed an increase in both
BrdUrd-positive VECs and LECs (Fig. 2B) compared with precursor
premalignant lesions. VECs and LECs both evidenced increased
presence of BrdUrd-positive endothelial cells in tumor centers
and peripheries of SCC-I (Fig. 2A and B); however, in SCC-II,
proliferating VECs were found in tumor centers and in the
periphery, whereas proliferating LECs were limited to tumor
periphery (Fig. 2A and B).
Blood and lymphatic vessel density and diameter during
neoplastic progression. To determine whether increased proliferation of endothelial cells in blood or lymphatic vessels yielded
increased vessel densities and sprouting of new vessels or
alternatively only resulted in increased girth (diameter) of
preexisting vessels, we assessed blood and lymphatic vessel
diameters and density (number of vessels per random high-power
field of vision) at each neoplastic stage (Fig. 3). Using fluorescent
angiography to assess blood vessel diameter in LM and
histopathologically staged neoplastic lesions, we found that blood
vessel diameters significantly increased at each premalignant stage
(Fig. 3A). In SCC-I and SCC-IIs, blood vessel diameter was similar
in both tumor centers and periphery (Fig. 3A). Assessment of
LYVE-1+ lymphatic capillary diameter similarly revealed a progressive increase during premalignant progression, albeit less dramatic
compared with blood vessels (Fig. 3A). Because collecting
lymphatic vessels express LYVE-1 at low levels, we used intralymphatic perfusion of colloidal carbon to assess their diameter in
LM and premalignant tissue and observed a progressive increase
in diameter in premalignant tissue (Fig. 3B). Lymphatic vessel
diameters in carcinomas at SCC-I peripheries were similar to late
dysplastic tissues, whereas lymphatic vessels at SCC-II peripheries
were further dilated (Fig. 3A). LYVE-1+ lymphatic vessel diameters
in SCC-I centers were decreased by comparison with peripheries
but were also significantly greater than those found in the center of
SCC-IIs (Fig. 3A), thus indicating that proliferation of endothelial

www.aacrjournals.org

cells results in vessels with enhanced diameters in both vessel
systems in premalignant and SCC tissues.
To evaluate the sprouting activity of new vessels as a result of
increased VEC and/or LEC proliferation, we assessed vessel
densities by quantitatively examining CD31Hi/LYVE-1 (blood)
and CD31Lo/LYVE-1+ (lymphatic) vessels in tissue sections (Fig. 3C).
We found significant increases in the number of CD31Hi/LYVE-1
blood vessels per field of vision at each premalignant stage
(Fig. 3C). In carcinomas, the number of CD31Hi/LYVE-1 blood
vessels remained comparable with late dysplastic tissue independent of localization or SCC grade (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the
progressive increase in lymphatic vessel diameter was not
accompanied by increased vessel density as shown by constant
numbers of CD31Lo/LYVE-1+ lymphatic vessels in premalignant
tissues and in periphery and centers of SCC-I and periphery of
SCC-IIs (Fig. 3C). CD31Lo/LYVE-1+ lymphatic vessels were decreased in SCC-II centers (Fig. 3C). Together, these data indicate
that proliferation of endothelial cells in the two vessel systems
results in distinct phenotypic responses. Whereas blood vessels
increase in diameter and density, lymphatic vessels increase only
in diameter without an increase in density, thus reflecting increased
sprouting of new blood vessels (i.e., classic angiogenesis) as opposed
to increased girth without sprouting of lymphatic vessels.
Altered tissue fluid homeostasis and lymphatic functionality
in neoplastic tissue. Altered proliferation and/or diameter of
either vessel system could variably alter their physiologic functions
in tissue and thereby alter tissue hemodynamics and/or fluid
content. To assess functionality of blood vessels, we evaluated their
perfusability on fluorescein-conjugated L. esculentum injection
(Fig. 3A) and their leakage characteristics using a modified Miles
assay (Fig. 4A; ref. 27). These studies revealed increased extravasation of Evans blue tracer in hyperplastic and dysplastic HPV16
tissue compared with LM skin (Fig. 4A). In spite of the increased
density and diameter of perfused, thus functional blood vessels
in tumor tissue (Fig. 3A and C), we found decreased vascular
leakage in carcinomas where distinct extravasation characteristics
were found in tumor centers versus periphery (Fig. 4A).
To examine whether increased extravasation of plasma proteins
resulted in increased tissue fluid content, we evaluated the

relationship between blood vessel leakage (Fig. 4A) and lymphatic
drainage by determining tissue fluid amounts at each neoplastic
stage (Fig. 4B) and found that tissue fluid in premalignant HPV16
ear tissue was significantly higher than LM tissue and further
increased in tumor peripheries, with the central regions of SCCs
having the highest fluid content (Fig. 4B). Because a major function
of lymphatics is to drain excess tissue fluid, one interpretation of
these data would be that the drainage capacity of premalignant
lymphatics had been exceeded due to lymphatic dysfunction
perhaps reflected by tissue fluid accumulation. To access this
hypothesis, we further induced vascular leakage acutely by topical
application of mustard oil (compared with mineral oil) and
assessed Evans blue dye leakage into dysplastic HPV16 ear skin
versus LM. As expected, mustard oil application further increased
leakage of plasma proteins out of blood vessels in both LM and
HPV16 skin, 16.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 4C); however, these
increases resulted in similar accumulations of tissue fluid content
in LM (8%) and dysplastic HPV16 (8%) tissue (Fig. 4D), indicating
that clearance of tissue fluid by premalignant lymphatics is not at
maximum capacity. Thus, whereas lymphatics in acutely activated
homeostatic tissue are more efficient at clearing excess tissue fluid,
functional lymphatics in premalignant tissue maintain tissue fluid
dynamics to a similar degree.
To directly assess lymphatic functionality in premalignant tissue,
we i.d. injected high molecular weight, fluorescently labeled
dextran (TRITC-dextran) tracer and monitored uptake and
drainage kinetics by lymphatic capillaries over time in LM and
dysplastic ear skin (Fig. 5A). Lymphatic capillaries were rapidly
labeled by tracer in both control and HPV16 ears, indicating rapid
uptake. Twenty minutes following injection, tracer-containing
capillaries were detectable, indicating continuous lymph formation,
thus showing their functional status.
Functionality of collecting lymphatic vessels in premalignant
tissue was also evaluated following intralymphatic injection of
colloidal carbon (Fig. 5B). Colloidal carbon is excluded by
lymphatic capillaries during lymph formation due to its large
molecular weight.4 Direct injection of colloidal carbon into dermal
lymphatics of LM and dysplastic ear skin revealed efficient
drainage of tracer from collecting lymphatic vessels in both tissues
within 20 min (Fig. 5B), thus showing their similar functionality.
Together, these analyses reveal functionality of lymphatic capillaries and collecting vessels in premalignant tissues based on their
ability to efficiently clear tracer and fluid (Fig. 5A and B) through
their open lumina (Fig. 3A and B). Direct analysis of lymphatic
functionality in tumor tissue was hampered by technical difficulties
doing direct intralymphatic colloidal carbon injection as well as
analysis of interstitial drainage using smaller molecular weight
dyes (colorimetric or fluorescent) readily taken up by functional
lymphatics. Despite these failed attempts to analyze lymphatic
functionality in tumor tissue, the implication that open luminal
status is associated with vessel functionality in premalignant tissue,
in combination with our assessment of tissue fluid content in
tumor centers versus tumor periphery (Fig. 4B), leads us to
conclude that lymphatics with open lumina in premalignant
tissue, at peripheries of SCCs and centers of grade 1 SCCs (Fig. 3C),
retain functionality where they efficiently clear interstitial fluid,
as opposed to tumor centers of less-differentiated SCCs where

lymphatic lumens are predominantly compressed and exhibit
diminished fluid drainage capacity (Fig. 3C, bottom right), a
characteristic feature of poorly differentiated carcinomas (28–30).

Discussion
Data presented herein indicate that blood and lymphatic
vasculature undergo distinct physiologic and architectural alterations during de novo neoplastic progression accompanying
carcinoma development. Whereas endothelial cells of each network
acquire proliferative capabilities as neoplasia ensues, resultant
phenotypes of blood versus lymphatic vessels are distinct. Whereas
blood vessels undergo classic angiogenic changes (e.g., increased
endothelial cell proliferation, vessel diameter, density, and leakage),
lymphatic vessels evidence no alterations to support the notion
that sprouting of new vessels occurs. Instead, the increased level of
proliferating LECs present in lymphatic vessels enhances diameter
of vessels that efficiently clear interstitial fluid in premalignant
tissues and peripheries of carcinomas, but not in their centers,
areas where interstitial fluid content remains high. Together, these
studies show that neoplasia-associated angiogenesis, as opposed
to lymphangiogenesis, is a distinct vascular process even when
initiated by similar physiologic stimuli.
Endothelial cell proliferation. Endothelial cells in quiescent
tissues divide approximately once every 2 to 3 years if unstimulated
(31). During cancer development, however, it is well established
that local tissue levels of the proangiogenic factor vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A increase and, as a result,
enhance proliferation of VECs and sprouting of new blood vessels
from preexisting vascular beds (5). In contrast, lymphangiogenesis
(e.g., induction of LEC proliferation) in human cancers (32, 33)
correlates instead with increased tissue levels of VEGF-C and
VEGF-D (34–36). Accordingly, exogenous expression of VEGF-C or
VEGF-D in experimental murine tumor xenograft models induces
LEC proliferation and subsequent lymphangiogenesis (37, 38),
whereas exogenous VEGF-A expression induces not only an
angiogenic response but also lymphangiogenesis in nontumor
(24) and tumor tissue (39). It is not clear, however, if LEC responses
to increased VEGF-A levels represent a direct intrinsic response
of LECs or, instead, an indirect physiologic response resulting
from increased tissue fluid due to increased leakage of plasma
proteins from newly formed immature angiogenic blood vessels.
In this study, we found evidence of angiogenesis as well as
lymphangiogenesis in premalignant tissues of HPV16 mice and in
emergent malignant carcinomas. Patterns of LEC proliferation
varied from that observed with VECs, thus indicating distinct
responses between the two endothelial cell subpopulations to
proangiogenic and/or prolymphangiogenic growth factors present
in their microenvironment. Whereas VEGF-A mRNA levels have
been reported to remain constant during premalignant angiogenesis in a UV-induced murine skin carcinoma model (40), enhanced
VEC proliferation in HPV16 mice is paralleled by progressive
increases in VEGF-A mRNA expression (41) and protein levels
(42). About LEC proliferation, our analyses indicate that, although
LECs in premalignant tissue evidence enhanced proliferative status
compared with homeostatic tissue, their proliferation does not
significantly increase until malignant conversion occurs. Because
we have observed increased mRNA levels of VEGF-C in fully
malignant carcinomas (data not shown), our interpretation of
these data is that LECs respond modestly to increased VEGF-A
levels in premalignant tissue but more are responding to increased

microenvironmental stress and need to clear fluid from premalignant tissue resultant from leaky immature angiogenic blood
vessels.
Vascular sprouting. VEGF-A is a major proangiogenic factor
well documented to induce VEC proliferation and vascular
sprouting (43). Sprouting of the lymphatic vasculature, however,
depends on VEGF-C in experimental chick chorioallantoic
membrane assays, wound healing, and embryonic development
(44–46). Recent studies in murine tumor models (transgenic and
xenograft models) provide evidence that increased levels of
VEGF-C and/or VEGF-D promote tumor lymphangiogenesis,
including lymphatic vessel sprouting (47–50). In contrast to these
experimental tumor models, no increase in lymphatic vessel
density was observed in HPV16 tissues, indicating that LEC
proliferation in a de novo tumor model lacking exogenous
expression of VEGF-C and/or VEGF-D does not result in lymphatic
vessel sprouting but instead contributed to increased diameter
(girth) of existing lymphatics to enable rapid clearance of tissue
fluid resulting from increased leakage of plasma proteins from
angiogenic blood vessels.
Tissue fluid dynamics in premalignant and SCC tissue. Blood
and lymphatic vessels are functionally interdependent vascular
systems (6) that together regulate tissue fluid dynamics and
influence tissue homeostasis. In a UV-induced skin carcinogenesis
model, Hagendoorn et al. (40) revealed alterations in blood
vasculature, architectural changes, and impairment of lymphatic
vessels along with increased IFP in premalignant tissues and thus
hypothesized that blood and lymphatic vasculature loose their
functional interdependence during premalignant progression. Our
data, however, indicate that, during squamous carcinogenesis in
HPV16 mice, the two vessel systems retain a functional interrelationship in premalignant tissue and in well-differentiated carcinomas as evidenced by increased blood vessel leakage accompanied
by retained ability to clear fluid, albeit in tissue with higher tissue
fluid content than normal.
Lymphatic vessel functionality. We observed that intratumoral
lymphatic vessel functionality inversely correlates with SCC grade.
In the published literature, there are contradicting reports on the
existence of intratumoral lymphatics in human (9, 10, 32, 33, 51)
and experimental rodent (37, 38, 40, 49, 52) tumors, where only
peripheral lymphatic structures are hypothesized to retain

functionality, whereas intratumoral lymphatic structures were
rendered nonfunctional due to compression by rapidly proliferating
tumor cells (52). Similarly, we found functional lymphatic vessels
at tumor peripheries but also observed open lumen/functional
lymphatic vessels in centers of low-grade SCCs. Our interpretation
of these observations is that functional properties of higher-grade,
less-differentiated carcinomas correlate with, and is effected by,
limited lymphatic vessel functionality that, in turn, likely regulates
tumor cell physiology and/or behavior.
In summary, by examining proliferation, diameter, density, and
functionality of blood versus lymphatic vasculature during de novo
cancer development, we have revealed unique features of each
vasculature that illuminates their interdependency during premalignant progression as opposed to their independence in highergrade carcinomas. Maintenance of the interdependence between
blood and lymphatic systems during premalignancy and in lowgrade carcinomas enables efficient fluid transport from leaky blood
vasculature via interstitia into draining, open lumen lymphatic
vessels, which would result in minimizing IFP. The closed nature of
lymphatic vessels in higher-grade carcinomas would exclude this
and support elevated IFPs common to less-differentiated carcinomas. The implication of these findings supports the notion that
delivery of anticancer therapeutics would best be realized in
premalignant tissue, in situ carcinomas, or carcinomas displaying
well-differentiated characteristics, where tissue hemodynamics
better support drug delivery.
