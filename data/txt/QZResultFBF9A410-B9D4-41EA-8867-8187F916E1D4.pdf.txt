Abstract
Uveal melanoma patients with metastatic disease usually die
within one year, emphasizing an urgent need to develop new
treatment strategies for this cancer. MEK inhibitors improve
survival in cutaneous melanoma patients but show only modest
efﬁcacy in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. In this study, we
screened for growth factors that elicited resistance in newly
characterized metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines to clinicalgrade MEK inhibitors, trametinib and selumetinib. We show that
neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) provide resistance to MEK inhibition. Mechanistically, trametinib
enhances the responsiveness to NRG1 and sustained HGF-mediated activation of AKT. Individually targeting ERBB3 and cMET,

the receptors for NRG1 and HGF, respectively, overcome resistance to trametinib provided by these growth factors and by
conditioned medium from ﬁbroblasts that produce NRG1 and
HGF. Inhibition of AKT also effectively reverses the protective
effect of NRG1 and HGF in trametinib-treated cells. Uveal melanoma xenografts growing in the liver in vivo and a subset of liver
metastases of uveal melanoma patients express activated forms of
ERBB2 (the coreceptor for ERBB3) and cMET. Together, these
results provide preclinical evidence for the use of MEK inhibitors
in combination with clinical-grade anti-ERBB3 or anti-cMET
monoclonal antibodies in metastatic uveal melanoma. Cancer Res;

Introduction

BRAF mutations are infrequent in uveal melanoma (3–6). Activating mutations in two a subunits of the heterotrimeric G
proteins, GNAQ and GNA11, are found in 80% of uveal melanomas in mutually exclusive manner and are believed to occur at
an early stage of disease (7–11). The GNAQ and GNA11 mutations are typically in Q209 but less frequently in R183. Other
studies have also identiﬁed recurrent mutations in SF3B1 (12–
14), a RNA splicing factor, and EIF1AX (12) in primary uveal
melanoma with disomy 3 and associate with low metastatic
potential. Inactivating mutations in the tumor-suppressor
BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) on chromosome 3 are found
in 32% to 50% of primary uveal melanoma and associate with a
more aggressive/higher likelihood of metastasis (15–17).
Oncogenic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 abrogate their
intrinsic GTPase activities, resulting in activation of the RAF/MEK/
ERK1/2 and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, JNK, and p38 via
regulation of the small GTPases of RhoA and Rac1 (18). These
signaling pathways promote tumor proliferation and growth.
Knockdown of GNAQ in mutant, but not wild-type, uveal melanoma cell lines diminishes ERK1/2 activation and induces cellcycle arrest (8, 19) and AMP-activated protein kinase–dependent
autophagic cell death (20). Although these ﬁndings emphasize
the potential of targeted therapy in uveal melanoma, directly
targeting mutant GNAQ and GNA11 has proved to be structurally
challenging.
Targeting MEK with small-molecule inhibitors, such as trametinib (GSK1120212) and selumetinib (AZD6244), has been
pursued in clinical trials for melanoma. Trametinib monotherapy
has achieved 25% to 40% partial/complete response rates in BRAF
V600E/K cutaneous melanoma patients (21). In contrast, while
trametinib is recently FDA-approved for cutaneous melanoma, it
is largely ineffective in uveal tumors. In a phase I trial containing

Uveal melanoma originates from the melanocytes within the
iris, choroid, and ciliary body (1). Each year, approximately 2,500
new patients will be diagnosed with this disease in the United
States. Half of these patients will develop metastases, typically in
the liver, within 15 years of initial diagnosis with a peak of
metastasis between 2 and 5 years. Although there are effective
therapeutic strategies to prevent local recurrence and to eradicate
primary uveal melanoma, patients with metastatic disease are
found to be refractory to current chemotherapies and immune
checkpoint blockers and usually die within a year (2).
Recent advances have identiﬁed genetic alterations in uveal
melanoma. In contrast to its cutaneous counterpart, oncogenic

16 uveal melanoma patients, 8 patients had stable disease but no
partial or complete responses were observed (21). In a phase II
trial, selumetinib improved progression-free survival compared
with standard chemotherapy (15.9 vs. 7.0 weeks; ref. 22).
Although overall survival was improved with selumetinib, the
improvement did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, possibly due to
the crossover study design. Thus, targeting MEK alone in uveal
melanoma patients has limited clinical beneﬁt. In uveal melanoma cells line studies, MEK inhibition alone elicited a cell-cycle
arrest but did not induce apoptosis (19). To determine the
underlying mechanisms, we explored the adaptive and/or innate
resistance pathways that bypass the requirement for MEK/ERK1/2
signaling in uveal melanoma.
In this study, we show that two growth factors, neuregulin 1
(NRG1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), mediate resistance
to the MEK inhibitors trametinib (23) and selumetinib (24) in
metastatic human uveal melanoma cells. Mechanistically, MEK
inhibition enhances responsiveness to NRG1 and promotes sustained HGF-induced phosphorylation of cMET. Targeting NRG1–
ERBB3 or HGF–cMET signaling overcomes the respective growth
factor–mediated resistance. In addition, ﬁbroblast-derived factors
act in a paracrine manner to induce resistance to trametinib
through activating NRG1–ERBB3 and HGF–cMET signaling in
uveal melanoma cells. Finally, ERBB2 (the coreceptor for ERBB3)
and cMET were activated in an orthotopic metastatic uveal melanoma mouse model and in a subset of liver metastases of uveal
melanoma. Together, these data suggest that cotargeting MEK
with ERBB3 and/or cMET may enhance the efﬁcacy of MEK
inhibitor in advanced-stage uveal melanoma patients.

Materials and Methods
Metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines and cell culture
UM001, UM003, and UM004 were derived from liver, retroperitoneal and orbital metastases of human uveal melanoma,
respectively. The mutational status of UM001 and UM003 cells
was described previously (25). Mutational analysis of GNAQ was
performed by Sanger sequencing. UM001 cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS, 10% nonessential amino acids, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10
mmol/L HEPES buffer, 50 IU/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL
streptomycin. UM003 and UM004 cells were maintained in MEM
medium containing 15% (UM003 cells) or 10% (UM004 cells)
heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin–streptomycin. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)–immortalized foreskin
ﬁbroblastic BJ1 cells were provided by Dr. Ubaldo MartinezOutschoorn (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The
human embryonic lung ﬁbroblastic Wi38 cell line was purchased
from the ATCC. HT-BJ1 and Wi38 cell lines were maintained in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS
and penicillin–streptomycin. To collect conditioned medium
from HT-BJ1 and Wi-38, cells were cultured in UM001 or
UM003/4 medium for 3 days.
Inhibitors, growth factors, and function-blocking antibodies
Trametinib (GSK1120212), selumetinib (AZD6244), lapatinib, crizotinib, and MK2206 were purchased from Selleck
Chemicals. Recombinant human NRG1, PDGF-BB, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology; recombinant human epidermal growth
factor (EGF) was purchased from Lonza Walkersville Inc.;
recombinant human HGF was provided by Michael P. Lisanti

(University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom).
Humanized ERBB3 monoclonal antibody U3-1287 was provided by U3 Pharma GmbH.
Short-interfering RNA and transfection
UM001 and UM004 cells (3  105) were seeded in 6-well
plates. The next day, cells were transfected for 4 to 6 hours with
chemically synthesized short-interfering RNAs (siRNA) at a ﬁnal
concentration of 25 nmol/L using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) as previously described (26). cMET siRNAs (#1:
GAAGAUCAGUUUCCUAAUU; #2: CCAGAGACAUGUAUGAUAA) and ERBB2 siRNAs (#1: GGACGAAUUCUGCACAAUG;
#2: GACGAAUUCUGCACAAUGG) were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. The nontargeting siRNA (UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU) was used as a control.
MTS assay
UM001, UM003, and UM004 cells (3–6  103 cells/well) were
plated overnight into 96-well plates and treated with trametinib
(0.003–0.4 mmol/L) or vehicle (DMSO) for 72 hours. Each assay
was performed in triplicate. Cell growth inhibition was assayed by
the MTS (Promega Corporation) according to the manufacturer's
instructions (error bars reﬂect SEM of three independent experiments). IC50 and IC25 values were calculated using GraphPad
Prism.
Western blotting
Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed directly in Laemmli
sample buffer. Lysates were resolved by SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membranes. Membranes were blocked with 1% BSA and incubated with indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 C. Western blotting assays were detected using the horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies followed by development
using chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Primary antibodies
used were: ERK2 (D-2) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.;
ERBB3 (1B2E), phospho-ERBB3 Y1197 (C56E4), phosphoERBB3 Y1289 (21D3), ERBB2 (D8F12), phospho-ERBB2
Y1196 (D66B7), MET, phospho-MET Y1234/1235 (D26),
PDGFR, phospho-PDGFRb Y751 (C63G6), EGFR, phosphoEGFR Y845, IGF1R, phospho-IGF1Rb Y1131, AKT, phospho-AKT
T308 (C31E5E), phospho-AKT S473 (D9E), phospho-ERK1/2
(D13.14.4E), and phospho-TSC2 T1462 from Cell Signaling
Technology; and actin from Sigma-Aldrich. Chemiluminescence
was visualized on a Versadoc MultiImager and quantitated using
Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad).
Flow cytometry
Cells were trypsinized, washed with cold PBS, and resuspended in 0.5 mL of cold PBS to achieve single-cell suspension.
Cells were then ﬁxed in 4.5 mL of 70% ethanol for 2 hours,
followed by centrifugation at 800  g for 5 minutes. Cell pellets
were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 1 mL of 0.1%
(v/v) Triton X-100 staining solution containing 100 ng/mL of
RNase and 40 mg/mL of propidium iodide (PI) for 30 minutes
at room temperature. Staining was then analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry on a BD FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed by the FlowJo software (TreeStar,
Inc.). To determine cell surface expression of ERBB3 and cMET,
uveal melanoma cells were incubated in PBS with 2% BSA and
50 mL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-ERBB3 antibody

(R&D Systems), PE-conjugated anti-cMET antibody, or isotype
control IgG antibody on ice for 45 minutes. Washed cells were
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry and data were analyzed by the
FlowJo software.
Cell viability assays
Cells were plated at a conﬂuency of 3  105 per well in 6-well
plates. The next day, growth factors, drugs, or function-blocking
antibodies were added as indicated. Cells were cultured for
additional 3 days (UM001 cells) or 5 days (UM003 cells, for
which medium and additives were replenished once), at which
time AlamarBlue (Invitrogen) was added to each well and allowed
to reduce for approximately 1 hour. Medium (120 mL) was
collected in triplicate from each condition and absorbance readings for oxidized and reduced AlamarBlue were taken at wavelengths 600 and 570 nm, respectively, in a Multiskan Spectrum
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc). The change in viability
was calculated from the resulting absorbance values using the
manufacturer's guidelines. All conditions were normalized to the
DMSO control.
Cell growth assays
Cells were plated as for viability assays and stained with crystal
violet solution (1% crystal violet, 10% buffered formalin) for 30
minutes. After decanting the staining solution, wells were thoroughly washed in distilled water and air-dried. Plates were imaged
by scanning while colonies were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti
inverted microscope (Nikon) with NIS-Elements AR 3.00 software
(Nikon).
Immunohistochemistry
UM001 cells (1  106) were injected into the liver of NSG mice
or hHGFki mice (STOCK Hgftm1.1(HGF)Aveo Prkdcscid/J; The Jackson Laboratory) and allowed to colonize for 4 to 5 weeks (NSG
mice) or 8 weeks (hHGFki mice). Tissue samples from UM001
xenografts were ﬁxed in formalin overnight. Parafﬁn-embedded
tissue sections were deparafﬁnized and antigen retrieval was
accomplished using high pH conditional buffer. Sections were
incubated with anti-phospho-ERBB2 Y1221/Y1222 (6B12) and
anti-phospho-cMET Y1234/Y1235 (D26) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight. The next day, sections were incubated for 30 minutes in ImmPRESS UNIVERSAL Reagent (Vector
Laboratories), followed by incubating for 2 to 5 minutes in
ImmPACT NOVA-RED (Vector Laboratories). Sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin.
Expression of phospho-ERBB2 and phospho-cMET in the liver
biopsy specimens from human uveal melanoma patients was
carried out in a Ventana Ultra stainer (Ventana Medical Systems).
In brief, heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed using cell
conditioner I buffer. Sections were then incubated with prediluted
primary antibodies, following by Alkaline Phosphatase Multimer
(Ventana Medical Systems) incubation. The fast red chromogen
was applied for bright fuchsia color development. The sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin for microscopic evaluation. The histologic evaluation of individual tumor specimens
was carried out with slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). The intensity of staining and the percentage of positive
cells were semi-quantitatively evaluated by a board-certiﬁed
pathologist (P.A. McCue) without clinical information. Staining
intensity was scaled as 0 (negative), 1 (weak to moderate positive), and 2 (strong positive).

Patient samples
Uveal melanoma liver metastatic biopsies were formalinﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded immediately following isolation.
IHC was performed using anti-phospho-ERBB2 Y1221/Y1222
(6B12) and anti-phospho-cMET Y1234/Y1235 (D26). Staining
was scored in a blinded manner, as above. Patient samples were
collected under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) at Thomas Jefferson University (IRB protocol
number: Control # 11E.548). All patients gave informed
consent.

Results
NRG1 and HGF rescue the growth-inhibitory effect of MEK
inhibitors in uveal melanoma cells
We determined the effects of clinically relevant, small-molecule MEK inhibitors in three genetically characterized cells
lines derived from uveal melanoma metastases: UM001 was
established from liver metastasis and harbors a GNAQ
Q209P mutation; UM003 was generated from retroperitoneal
metastasis and harbors a GNAQ Q209L mutation (25), and
UM004 was established from orbital metastasis and harbors a
GNAQ Q209P mutation (Supplementary Fig. S1A). On the
basis of initial dose response experiments (Supplementary
Fig. S1B), UM001, UM003, and UM004 cells were treated with
100 nmol/L of the MEK inhibitor, trametinib, in subsequent
experiments. Trametinib treatment rapidly and persistently
blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation in all cell lines (Fig. 1A). To
determine whether MEK inhibition led to growth arrest or a
cytotoxic effect, we treated cells with trametinib for 3 days
(UM001 and UM004 cells) or 5 days (UM003 cells) and
analyzed the cell-cycle proﬁle by PI staining (Fig. 1B). In all
three cell lines, trametinib caused a strong accumulation of the
sub-G1 population (trametinib vs. DMSO: 65% vs. 3% in
UM001 cells; 58% vs. 5% in UM003 cells; 23% vs. 0.5% in
UM004 cells) and a signiﬁcant reduction of S-phase population
(trametinib vs. DMSO: 1.3% vs. 7% in UM001 cells; 3.5% vs.
1% in UM003 cells; 7.5% vs. 2% in UM004 cells). These results
indicate that MEK inhibition elicits cytotoxicity and growth
arrest in monocultures of metastatic uveal melanoma cells.
Because drug resistance to targeted therapies may be mediated by the tumor microenvironment, we sought to identify
growth factors that are able to protect metastatic uveal melanoma cells from MEK inhibition. We screened ﬁve growth
factors: EGF; platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF); HGF;
NRG1, and IGF1 for their capacity to rescue uveal melanoma
cells from MEK inhibition. These growth factors did not
enhance proliferation and viability of UM001, UM003, and
UM004 cells compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1C and
D, left; Supplementary Fig. S2A, left; Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Treatment of uveal melanoma cells with trametinib dramatically decreased proliferation and viability, an effect that was
blocked by NRG1 and HGF but not EGF and PDGF (Fig. 1C and
D, right; Supplementary Fig. S2A, right; Supplementary Fig.
S2B). IGF1 enhanced proliferation and viability of trametinibtreated UM003 cells, albeit to a lesser extent than NRG1 and
HGF (Fig. 1D, right; Supplementary Fig. S2B, right). Next, we
tested a second MEK inhibitor, selumetinib/AZD6244, on uveal
melanoma cells. Selumetinib effectively blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). NRG1 and
HGF also rescued uveal melanoma cell survival from

These data demonstrate that NRG1 and HGF partially restore
growth and viability of metastatic uveal melanoma cells treated
with MEK inhibitors.
MEK inhibition enhances responsiveness to NRG1 through
ERBB3 and ERBB2 in uveal melanoma cells
On the basis of the upregulation of NRG1–ERBB3 signaling in
BRAF V600E cutaneous melanoma cells following RAF inhibitor
treatment (27), we tested the impact of trametinib on NRG1induced ERBB3 signaling in uveal melanoma cells. Treatment
with trametinib sensitized UM001 and UM003 cells to NRG1stimulated ERBB3 phosphorylation at Y1197 and Y1289 in dose
and time course experiments (Fig. 2A–C). Interestingly, UM003,
but not UM001 and UM004 cells, showed enhanced expression of
ERBB3 in response to trametinib (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Phosphorylated Y1197 and Y1298 in ERBB3 are within YXXMmotifs, which dock phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to
AKT phosphorylation (28). In line with enhanced phosphoERBB3 levels, AKT phosphorylation at S473 and T308 was elevated following NRG1 stimulation in trametinib-treated UM001
and UM003 cells (Fig. 2A–C). ERBB3 exhibits low intrinsic kinase
activity and uses a coreceptor, typically another ERBB family
member, to signal. UM001, UM003, and UM004 cells express
ERBB2 but undetectable levels of EGFR and ERBB4 in either basal
or trametinib-treated conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4B).

NRG1 stimulated ERBB2 phosphorylation in trametinib-treated
UM001 and UM003 cells (Fig. 2A–C). Furthermore, silencing
ERBB2 effectively inhibited NRG1-stimulated ERBB3 and AKT
phosphorylation in UM001 (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that
NRG1–ERBB3/ERBB2 signaling to AKT is elevated in MEK-inhibited, metastatic uveal melanoma cells.
Targeting NRG1 signaling overcomes resistance to MEK
inhibitors in metastatic uveal melanoma cells
To determine whether blocking ERBB3 prevents NRG1-mediated resistance to trametinib, we took two distinct strategies.
First, we used U3-1287, a humanized ERBB3 monoclonal
antibody that is being used in clinical setting (29). U3-1287
effectively blocked NRG1-stimulated phosphorylation of
ERBB3 and downstream AKT activation in UM001 cells (Fig.
3A). Second, we examined the effect of U3-1287 on NRG1induced resistance to trametinib. As above, cell proliferation
(Fig. 3B) and viability (Fig. 3C) of trametinib-treated UM001
cells were partially restored in the presence of NRG1. U3-1287
alone did not suppress the cell growth and viability of UM001
cells but effectively abrogated the protective effect of NRG1
(Fig. 3B and C). On the basis of our evidence that ERBB2 is the
coreceptor for NRG1 in uveal melanoma cells, we used lapatinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of ERBB2/EGFR. Lapatinib
alone did not affect survival of UM001 cells but did dramatically impair the ability of NRG1 to restore growth and viability

Resistance to Targeted Therapies

overnight following by stimulation with increasing doses of HGF.
In contrast to the effect of NRG1, HGF promoted the initial
phosphorylation of cMET and downstream activation of AKT
equivalently in trametinib-treated versus vehicle-treated UM001
and UM003 cells (Fig. 4A and B). However, HGF-induced phosphorylation of cMET and AKT was maintained at a higher level in
trametinib-treated cells at later time points (Fig. 4C). These effects
were associated with upregulated cell surface expression of cMET
following MEK inhibition in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
S5A). In contrast, IGF1 induced a transient activation of IGF1R
and AKT, irrespective of trametinib treatment, with phosphorylation returning to basal levels at later (>8 hours) time points
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). Our data suggest that the sustained
activation of AKT by HGF may compensate for the loss of ERK1/2
activation in trametinib-treated cells and contributes to resistance
to trametinib in uveal melanoma cells.
cMET inhibition overcomes HGF-mediated resistance to
trametinib in uveal melanoma cells
To test whether targeting cMET could abrogate HGF-mediated
resistance to trametinib in uveal melanoma cells, we ﬁrst used
crizotinib, a cMET/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor
(30, 31). In UM001 and UM003 cells, crizotinib blocked HGFinduced cMET phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5A). Uveal melanoma cells were treated with trametinib
alone, in combination with HGF and/or crizotinib. At the two
doses tested, crizotinib alone did not affect viability (Fig. 5B) or
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S6A) of UM001 and UM003
cells. As above, HGF partially restored the viability and cell
proliferation of trametinib-treated cells; an effect that was reversed
by crizotinib (Fig. 5B and C). As a second approach, we tested the
effect of silencing cMET expression on sensitivity to trametinib in
uveal melanoma cells. cMET knockdown alone neither altered
ERBB3 and ERBB2 levels nor affected cell growth in UM001 and
UM004 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Whereas control cells
were protected from trametinib-induced inhibition of colony
growth by HGF, cMET knockdown cells were sensitive to trametinib despite the presence of HGF (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
Thus, cMET is required for HGF-mediated resistance to
trametinib.
AKT inhibition reverses NRG1- and HGF-mediated resistance to
trametinib in uveal melanoma cells
Both NRG1 and HGF promote AKT signaling in trametinibtreated cells. To test whether NRG1- and HGF-driven resistance to
MEK inhibitors is mediated by AKT, we used the inhibitor
MK2206. Addition of MK2206 completely abrogated the protective effect of NRG1 and HGF in trametinib-treated UM001 (Fig.
5D) and UM003 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). Notably, MK2206
alone slightly inhibited growth of UM001 cells, while it did not
affect the growth of UM003 cells. MK2206 effectively blocked
NRG1- and HGF-initiated signaling, leading to AKT phosphorylation and downstream AKT targets in trametinib-treated UM001
cells (Fig. 5E). Thus, AKT contributes, at least in part, to the NRG1and HGF-mediated protection from MEK inhibitors.

and developed intrahepatic metastases with a high (18 of 19)
success rate. UM001 xenografts growing in NSG mice stained
positive for phospho ERBB2 (Fig. 7A, left). Because of the incompatibility of HGF across species (35), we implanted UM001 cells
into hHGFki mice, in which the cDNA of human HGF was
knocked into the mouse HGF locus by homologous recombination for analysis of phospho cMET. UM001 xenografts growing in
hHGFki mice stained positive for phospho cMET (Fig. 7A, right).
We next extended our study to analyze liver metastases of uveal
melanoma patients (Supplementary Table S1). Biopsies from 7
uveal melanoma patients with liver metastasis were stained with
anti-phospho ERBB2 and anti-phospho cMET antibodies. Staining intensity was scored 0 (negative staining), 1 (weak to medium
positive staining), and 2 (strong positive). Percentage of tumor
cells was semi-quantitated. We observed positive staining of
phospho ERBB2 in all seven samples and positive staining of

phospho cMET in ﬁve out of seven samples (Fig. 7B). Representative images with various staining intensity were shown in Fig.
7C. These data suggest that cMET and ERBB2 are activated in uveal
melanoma in the liver metastatic microenvironment.

Discussion
The response of genetically deﬁned tumors to a targeted therapy
is typically heterogeneous. Many patients display no tumor
shrinkage and are regarded as exhibiting primary/intrinsic resistance mediated by either preexisting (innate) or rapid adaptive
response mechanisms. Similar mechanisms may be present, albeit
to a lesser extent, in tumors that effectively respond to targeted
therapies and are likely to modulate the timing of acquired
resistance. Here, we describe that both innate and adaptive
mechanisms occur in mutant GNAQ metastatic uveal melanoma
cells responding to clinical-grade MEK inhibitors.

Our studies use GNAQ-mutant human metastatic uveal melanoma cell lines. These represent an important resource to the
ﬁeld given the high percentage of uveal melanomas harboring
GNAQ or GNA11 mutations, the noted lack of available cell lines
for uveal melanoma (36), the concern that lines may be cutaneous
melanoma (37), and the common use of lines derived from
nonmetastatic lesions for drug response studies in the uveal
melanoma literature. Using mutant GNAQ metastatic uveal melanoma lines, we show that clinical-grade MEK inhibitors (trametinib and selumetinib) block cell growth in vitro by either promoting cell death or inducing a proliferative arrest. This heterogeneous response is consistent with data from the Khalili and
colleagues (19) who showed that trametinib promoted >10%
increase in apoptosis in two out of six GNAQ/GNA11 uveal
melanoma cell lines. We identify two growth factors, NRG1 and
HGF, which are able to reverse the cytotoxic and growth-inhibitory effects of trametinib and selumetinib. However, the actions
of NRG1 and HGF on their cognate receptors, ERBB3 and cMET,

2746 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

differ. NRG1 activation of ERBB3 is enhanced in MEK-inhibited
cells in an adaptive manner. In contrast, initial HGF activation of
cMET is comparable in untreated and MEK inhibitor–treated cells,
although is more persistent in the MEK-inhibited cells. These data
are similar to ﬁndings in cutaneous mutant BRAF melanoma cells,
in which NRG1 adaptively upregulate ERBB3–AKT signaling in
response to vemurafenib/PLX4720 (27) and in which HGF promotes resistance via adaptive and innate mechanisms depending
on the cell line (34).
Both ERBB3 and cMET activate the PI3K–AKT pathway and the
addition of a PI3K inhibitor to MEK treatment enhances apoptosis
in mutant GNAQ cells in vitro (19). Furthermore, our data show
that targeting AKT reverses growth factor–mediated resistance. It
has long been recognized that the combination of ERK1/2 and
PI3K pathway inhibitors will likely be beneﬁcial in many tumor
settings; however, the advancement of PI3K and AKT targeting
agents is currently limited in the clinic by toxicity issues and poor
target inhibition. An additional concern is that ERBB3 expression/

Resistance to Targeted Therapies

activity is frequently upregulated as a compensatory feedback
mechanism to PI3K inhibitors (38, 39).
There is growing appreciation for the need for combinatorial
targeted therapy studies. For example, recent preclinical studies
show that combined inhibition of MEK and PKC improves
efﬁcacy compared with treatment with either single agent in
GNAQ/11-mutant uveal melanoma (40, 41). We tested the
effect of cotargeting the receptors, ERBB3 or cMET, in combination with MEK inhibitors. Targeting the ERBB3–ERBB2 complex with U3-1287/AMG88 or lapatinib effectively reversed the
NRG1-mediated resistance to MEK inhibitors. U3-1287 is one
example of a humanized ERBB3 antibody that has entered
early-phase clinical trials (29, 42). Similarly, we targeted cMET
either with crizotinib or by RNA interference. Crizotinib is an
ATP-competitive inhibitor of cMET as well as ALK and is FDAapproved for non–small cell lung carcinoma patients harboring
ALK gene fusions. Targeting cMET reversed HGF-mediated
protection from MEK inhibitor–induced growth blockade.
Others have used the cMET inhibitor, MK-8033, to inhibit
growth in mutant GNAQ uveal melanoma cells (43). Overall,
these data highlight that NRG1 and/or HGF-mediated resistance may underlie the modest response rate to MEK inhibitors
in metastatic uveal melanoma. Furthermore, our ﬁndings suggest that targeting ERBB3 and/or cMET may enhance the effect
of MEK inhibitor in advanced-stage, mutant GNAQ uveal
melanoma patients.
Low levels of phosphorylated ERBB3 and cMET were
detected in the absence of NRG1 and HGF, respectively, indicating that these ligands are poorly expressed by tumor cells.
Uveal melanoma frequently metastasizes to the liver, a tissue in
which both NRG1 and HGF are readily detected (44, 45),
highlighting the possibility that these growth factors mediate
resistance to MEK inhibitors via paracrine action. To this end,
we tested the effect of stromal-produced growth factors on
uveal melanoma cell resistance to MEK inhibitors. Wi38 and
BJ1 ﬁbroblasts produce high levels of NRG1 and HGF, respectively, and conditioned medium from these cells promoted AKT
phosphorylation and growth in MEK-inhibited uveal melanoma cells in a manner dependent on the cognate receptor. These
ﬁndings are similar to the notion that ﬁbroblast-derived HGF
protects against RAF inhibitors in cutaneous melanoma (34)
and add to growing evidence for factors in the tumor microenvironment being able to modulate the response to targeted
anticancer agents. Furthermore, our in vivo data from both uveal
melanoma cell liver colonization model and liver metastatic

patient samples show that the ERBB3–ERBB2 and cMET receptors are frequently phosphorylated.
In summary, we have identiﬁed that the growth factors, NRG1
and HGF, mediate resistance to MEK inhibitors in metastatic uveal
melanoma cells. Targeting NRG1 or HGF signaling overcomes the
resistance elicited by these growth factors. We have also provided
evidence that paracrine effects of NRG1 and HGF from ﬁbroblasts
protect uveal melanoma cells from MEK inhibition. These data
provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate resistance
to MEK inhibitors in metastatic uveal melanoma. Ongoing efforts
are focused on using clinical-grade anti-ERBB3 and anti-cMET
monoclonal antibodies in combination with MEK inhibitors in
preclinical studies.
