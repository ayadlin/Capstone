ABSTRACT
Several compounds bearing the indolinone chemical scaffold are known to
possess anticancer properties. For example, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib
is an arylideneindolin-2-one compound. The chemical versatility associated with
structural modifications of indolinone compounds underlies the potential to discover
additional derivatives possessing anticancer properties. Previously synthesized
3-(2-oxoethylidene)indolin-2-one compounds, also known as supercinnamaldehyde
(SCA) compounds in reference to the parent compound 1 [1-methyl-3(2oxopropylidene)indolin-2-one], bear a nitrogen-linked α,β-unsaturated carbonyl
(Michael acceptor) moiety. Here we found that analogs bearing N-substituents,
in particular compound 4 and 5 carrying an N-butyl and N-benzyl substituent,
respectively, were strongly cytotoxic towards human HCT 116 colorectal and MCF-7
breast carcinoma cells. These compounds also displayed strong thioredoxin reductase
(TrxR) inhibitory activity that was likely attributed to the electrophilicity of the
Michael acceptor moiety. Their selectivity towards cellular TrxR inhibition over related
antioxidant enzymes glutathione reductase (GR), thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione
peroxidase (GPx) was mediated through targeting of the selenocysteine (Sec) residue
in the highly accessible C-terminal active site of TrxR. TrxR inhibition mediated by
indolin-2-one compounds led to cellular Trx oxidation, increased oxidative stress
and activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). These events also
led to activation of p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathways, and cell death with apoptotic features of PARP cleavage and caspase 3
activation. In conclusion, these results suggest that indolin-2-one-based compounds
specifically targeting TrxR may serve as novel drug leads for anticancer therapy.

on the elevated antioxidant capacity for growth and
survival, which makes them susceptible when oxidative
stress is further elevated through production of more
ROS and/or inhibition of elevated antioxidant enzymes.
The selective targeting of cancer cells on the basis of
different redox states between normal and tumor cells is
therefore a feasible strategy [1, 3-6], particularly when
it involves targeting a redox adaptive mechanism that
confers drug resistance [2]. In this context, inhibition of

Due to aberrant metabolic events and abnormal
proliferative growth phenotypes, reactive oxygen species
(ROS) levels are commonly elevated in cancer cells
[references cited in 1, 2]. To cope with an increase in
intrinsic oxidative stress, cancer cells augment their
antioxidant capacity through upregulation of antioxidant
enzymes. In doing so, cancer cells become more dependent

the thioredoxin (Trx) system has emerged as a promising
redox-modulating strategy for anticancer therapy. The
Trx system, together with the glutathione system, forms
the two main cellular thiol antioxidant systems that
can be targeted for anticancer therapy [7, 8]. The Trx
system comprises Trx, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and
NADPH, where Trx executes antioxidant roles directly
by reducing protein disulfides, as well as indirectly by
donating reducing equivalents to peroxide scavenging
enzymes such as peroxiredoxins [9] or reductive repair
enzymes such as methionine sulfoxide reductases [10] or
sulfiredoxin [11]. In addition, through Trx’s involvement
in DNA synthesis, its role in the enzymatic regulation of
several redox-sensitive transcription factors, and its direct
binding to and inhibition of apoptosis signal regulating
kinase 1 (ASK1), the Trx system is highly important
for multiple cellular aspects involving cell survival and
proliferation [12, 13].
In carcinogenesis, several lines of evidence have
suggested that the Trx system can support tumor growth
and progression. Firstly, TrxR, the enzyme recycling
oxidized Trx to its reduced form, has been found to
be essential for tumorigenesis in mouse xenograft
models [14]. Secondly, Trx and TrxR are found to be
overexpressed in a number of human cancer cell lines and
primary tumors, and their overexpression is associated
with tumor aggressiveness, cancer drug resistance, and
poor prognosis [15-25]. TrxR is furthermore a promising
molecular target for anticancer therapy given that its
inhibition may lead to directly muted activities of TrxR
as well as downstream inhibition of components in
the Trx pathway. TrxR is an attractive target in view of
its druggability by virtue of the presence of an easily
accessible selenocysteine (Sec) residue located in the
C-terminal active center of the enzyme [26]. The selenol
group within a Sec residue is fully ionized at physiological
pH, making the nucleophilic selenolate anion available for
targeting by electrophilic compounds. Among classes of
compounds currently known to inhibit TrxR, several are
drugs used in anticancer therapy and of these many contain
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) moieties that
are perceived to target nucleophilic Sec and Cys residues
in the C- and/or N-terminal active site of mammalian TrxR
through Michael addition reactions [27-29].
Compounds bearing the indolin-2-one chemical
scaffold have been the focus of several biological studies
[30-34]. In the context of discovering anticancer agents,
the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib indicated for
the treatment of renal cell and gastrointestinal stromal
tumors [35, 36] is an arylideneindolin-2-one compound.
3-Benzylidene-indolin-2-ones are also promising
compounds for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma
and have been found to inhibit multiple tyrosine kinases
[37]. In another study that investigated the NAD(P)
H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) inducing activity
of a series of 3-benzylidene-indolin-2-ones, most of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the test compounds were found to cause induction of
NQO1, a cytoprotective enzyme whose upregulation
is usually associated with chemopreventive potential
[38]. Conversely, fewer compounds registered strong
anti-proliferative activities [38]. Derivatives carrying
N-substituents of indolinone compounds have not yet been
explored for cellular effects, which was therefore the aim
of the present study.
In our laboratory, a series of 3-(2-oxoethylidene)
indolin-2-ones were previously synthesized and
investigated for their chemopreventive and antiinflammatory potential [39]. Of note, these compounds are
also known as supercinnamaldehyde (SCA) compounds
in reference to the parent compound 1 [1-methyl-3(2oxopropylidene)indolin-2-one] that is commercially
known as supercinnamaldehyde. Among the tested
compounds, analogs carrying N-substituents were deemed
unsuitable candidates for use in chemopreventive and
anti-inflammatory strategies due to their strong antiproliferative properties [39]. Several of the compounds
were also found to activate the nuclear factor erythroid
2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor [39]
and since several Nrf2 activating compounds are
known to target TrxR [40], we here hypothesized that
Michael acceptor-containing indolin-2-one compounds,
particularly those that displayed potent cytotoxicities,
could possess TrxR inhibitory activities. In this study,
we report the discovery of indolin-2-one compounds
carrying N-substituents that indeed display enhanced TrxR
inhibitory and cellular anti-proliferative activities. N-butyl
and N-benzyl substituents yielded the most potent analogs
that could thereby serve as promising lead compounds for
development of novel anticancer drug therapies.

RESULTS
Indolin-2-one compounds display anti-proliferative
and in vitro TrxR inhibitory activities
A series of analogs (structures presented in Table 1)
containing a Michael acceptor-based 3-(2-oxopropylidene)
indolin-2-one scaffold was evaluated for cytotoxicity
towards human-derived colorectal HCT 116 and breast
MCF-7 carcinoma cells over a duration of 72 h. The
compounds exhibited varied growth inhibitory and
cytotoxic effects in both cell lines, as indicated by their
respective GI50 and LC50 values (Table 2). HCT 116 cells
were generally more susceptible to the compounds. Among
the tested compounds, analogs with an R1 substituent
more bulky than a methyl group (compounds 2-5) were
observed to elicit greater anti-proliferative activities.
Notably, compounds 5 and 4 bearing a benzyl and n-butyl
R1 substituent, respectively, possessed the strongest antiproliferative activities (Table 2; compounds were arranged
in ascending order of GI50 and LC50 values). Compound 6, a
derivative bearing a methyl and a phenyl substituent at the

*Compound 1 is the parent compound; also commercially known as supercinnamaldehyde (SCA).
R1 and R2 position, respectively, exhibited enhanced growth
inhibitory properties in comparison to the parent compound
1. On the other hand, the remaining analogs containing a
common methyl R1 group and a substituted phenyl group at
the R2 position did not exhibit enhanced anti-proliferative
activities in comparison to the parent compound 1.
The inhibition of recombinant mammalian TrxR
by indolin-2-one compounds after 30 min of incubation
in the presence of NADPH was evaluated in the in vitro
5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) acid (DTNB) reduction
assay and the IC50 values are presented in Table 2. To
illustrate the dose-dependent inhibitory activities of
the tested compounds, the extent of TrxR inhibition by
selected indolin-2-one compounds 1, 4, 5 and 6 over a
range of 1-100 µM is presented in Figure 1A. Comparison
of the IC50 values at 30 min with the GI50 values revealed
a strong correlation between the TrxR inhibitory and
anti-proliferative activities of the analogs for the HCT
116 cell line (r = 0.8) whereas for the MCF-7 cell line,
the correlation was relatively weaker (r = 0.47) (Figure
1B). This correlation suggested that TrxR inhibition could
potentially serve as an underlying mechanism for at least
part of the anti-proliferative effects of these compounds.
The effects of lead indolin-2-one compounds 4 and 5 on
the viability of MRC-5 human normal lung fibroblasts
were also tested and found to possess a greater LC50 value
by approximately 2-fold (compound 4: LC50 value 9.7 ±

0.2 µM in HCT 116 cells versus 25.5 ± 2.7 µM in MRC-5
cells; compound 5: LC50 value 9.4 ± 0.3 µM in HCT 116
cells versus 22.7 ± 2.4 μM in MRC-5 cells. The marginal
selectivity of the compounds for cancer cell lines over
normal cell types would need further work either through
deriving more analogs bearing desirable structural features
or utilization of cancer cell-targeted delivery approaches to
improve selectivity.

Lead indolin-2-one compounds selectively inhibit
cellular TrxR activity
To further probe whether the correlation between
TrxR inhibition and cytotoxic effects (Figure 1B) could
be casual, we next assessed whether the compounds
were more selective for TrxR than targeting other redox
active enzymes. Specificity of the selected indolin-2one compounds 1, 4, 5 and 6 towards GR and GPx was
first evaluated in in vitro assays using pre-reduced yeast
non-selenoprotein GR and bovine selenoprotein GPx
enzymes. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B respectively,
activities of yeast GR and bovine GPx were found to
be uninhibited after 60 min incubation with the selected
compounds. Instead, some compounds were observed to
cause marginal elevation of GR (for compound 6) and
GPx (for compound 4) activity. The selectivity of these
four analogs against Trx- and GSH-related enzymes was

next examined in a cellular context using HCT 116 and
MCF-7 cells. As illustrated in Figure 3A, a shorter 10
h treatment with compounds 1 and 6 at concentrations
around the LC50 values in the 72 h incubations (20,
30 and 40 µM; see Table 1) and a lethal concentration
(50 µM) did not cause apparent inhibition of cellular
TrxR activity. On the contrary, the more cytotoxic lead
compounds 4 and 5 caused a decrease in TrxR activity
in a dose-dependent manner within this time frame
(Figure 3A). In particular, compound 5 produced a
significant reduction in cellular TrxR activity at 40 and
50 µM, respectively, in both HCT 116 and MCF-7 cells
(Figure 3A). Additionally, Western blot analyses showed
that levels of TrxR protein in lysate samples of these
cells treated with compounds 4 and 5 were not lower
than in cells treated with vehicle, suggesting that the
decrease in cellular TrxR activity was due to formation
of irreversibly inhibited enzyme species (Figure 3E).

The cellular activities of GR, Trx and GPx, in contrast,
were either constant or increased (Figure 3B, 3C and
3D respectively), indicating that the indolin-2-one
compounds were selective for TrxR inhibition. The
increased activities could likely have been due to Nrf2
activation, as previously found for several indolin-2one analogs [39]. Indeed, when wild-type (Keap1+/+)
and Keap1-null (Keap1−/−) MEFs were treated with
compounds 4 and 5, the Keap1−/− MEFs that had the
Keap1 gene {Keap1 protein is a negative regulator of
Nrf2 [41]} knocked out were not only more resistant
to indolin-2-one-mediated TrxR inhibition (Figure 4A)
than the Keap1+/+ MEFs (Figure 4B), but also displayed
elevated TrxR activity when treated with compounds at
concentrations 20 to 40 µM (Figure 4A). The results,
which were in agreement with higher expression levels
of Nrf2 and TrxR in the Keap1−/− MEFs than those in
the Keap1+/+ MEFs (Figure 4C), had indicated that the

cells were attributed to increased Nrf2 activation.

indolin-2-one compounds to thiols and the more oxidized
state of the cells as compared to untreated cells.
One mechanism through which Trx can exert
anti-apoptotic effects involves suppression of ASK1dependent apoptosis through a direct inhibitory proteinprotein interaction between reduced Trx and ASK1 [43].
This interaction is dependent on the redox state of Trx,
with oxidation of Trx resulting in the dissociation of
the Trx-ASK1 complex, which was therefore examined
next. Indeed, Trx immunoprecipitation from lysates
of ASK1-overexpressing HCT 116 cells treated with
compound 4 revealed a dose-dependent decrease
in the amount of ASK1 bound to Trx1 (Figure 5D).
This corresponded to an increased activation of the
ASK1 downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) targets p38 and JNK [phosphorylated p38
(p-p38) and JNK (p-JNK)] (Figure 5E). Finally,
ASK1-dependent activation of p38 and JNK MAPK
pathways triggered apoptotic cell death, as evident from
a dose-dependent appearance of apoptotic markers such
as cleaved forms of PARP and caspase 3 (Figure 5F).
Of note, a higher concentration (50 µM) of the more
cytotoxic compound 5 brought about lower activation
of PARP and caspase-3 (Figure 5F), which could have
been due to excessive oxidative stress instead leading
to necrosis.

TrxR inhibition by lead indolin-2-one
compounds leads to Trx oxidation and induction
of ASK1-mediated apoptotic cell death
The cellular events linking TrxR inhibition by
indolin-2-one lead compounds to cell death were examined
in HCT 116 cells. First, the redox state of cellular Trx was
probed using an IAA-coupled alkylation method [42].
This analysis had revealed time-dependent oxidation of
Trx following treatment with compounds 4 and 5 at the
lethal dose of 40 µM (Figure 5A), suggesting that TrxR
inhibition caused by indolin-2-one compounds triggered
Trx oxidation. Second, a significant dose-dependent
elevation in cellular oxidative stress was evident within
3 h of treatment with compounds 4 and 5, as illustrated
using a DCF fluorescence assay (Figure 5B). Notably,
treatment with 50 µM of compound 4 and 5 resulted in
markedly increased DCF fluorescence as compared to that
seen in DMSO control cells. Consistent with the observed
increase in DCF fluorescence, treatment of HCT 116
cells with lead compounds 4 and 5 for 5 h were found to
cause depletion of total cellular thiols in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 5C). This had indicated the reactivity of

of TrxR inhibition, and juglone and DTNB reduction by TrxR. A. Upon incubation of recombinant rat TrxR (15 nM) with

250 µM NADPH and juglone, compound 4 or 5 at indicated concentrations, consumption of NADPH was measured at 340 nm for
20 min. Results represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. B. Investigation of the irreversibility of TrxR inhibition
by compounds 4 and 5. Recombinant rTrxR (0.9 µM) was incubated with 20 µM of the lead compounds and 200 µM NADPH for 30
min. Excess compound was removed by desalting the protein sample using an NAP-5 column. TrxR activity was determined by DTNB
reduction assay at indicated timepoints before and after desalting. Results shown are representative of two independent experiments.
C. Effects of lead indolin-2-one compounds on dose-dependent juglone reduction and DTNB reduction by TrxR. Recombinant rat TrxR
(15 nM) was reduced by 250 µM NADPH and incubated with indicated concentrations of compound 4 or 5 for 15 min. Following the
incubation, DTNB reduction or juglone reduction were measured. For DTNB reduction, 50 µl of 8.75 µM DTNB solution in TE buffer
was added and DTNB reduction was measured at 412 nm for 2 min. For juglone reduction, 100 µl of 300 µM juglone solution in TE
buffer was added and NADPH consumption at 340 nm was monitored for 5 min. The results were expressed as % of TrxR juglone
reduction or DTNB reduction activity of drug-treated sample over that of DMSO-treated sample. Results are presented as means ± SD
of three independent experiments.

activity, followed by desalting to remove any excess of
unbound compound. TrxR activity could not be recovered
within 2 h of post-desalting (Figure 6B), suggesting that
compounds 4 and 5 were irreversible inhibitors of TrxR.
Several inhibitors of mammalian TrxR have been
shown to cause formation of selenium compromised
thioredoxin reductase apoptotic proteins (SecTRAPs),
which are incapable of supporting Trx reduction
due to targeting of the Sec residue in the C-terminal
active center, whereas an N-terminal active center
remains functional allowing for an NADPH oxidaselike activity of the enzyme to persist [45]. Generation
of SecTRAPs can thereby lead to enhanced ROS
production, which may trigger a mixture of apoptotic
and necrotic cell death due to excessive oxidative stress
[45]. To investigate whether the compounds produced
SecTRAPs from TrxR, redox cycling with juglone by
recombinant TrxR inhibited by lead indolin-2-one
compounds was studied, which is a model assay for
SecTRAPs properties [45]. The results showed that
juglone reduction was more preserved than DTNB
reduction upon inhibition by compounds 4 and 5
(Figure 6C), indeed suggesting formation of SecTRAPs.
We next investigated whether the compounds targeted
the Sec residue in the C-terminal active center of
mammalian TrxR using an alternative N-(biotinoyl)N’-(iodoacetyl)-ethylenediamine (BIAM) labeling
assay [46]. In this assay, recombinant TrxR incubated
with 200 µM NADPH and 20 µM of compound 4 or 5
for specified timepoints was next probed with BIAM at
pH 6.5, which allows preferential alkylation of reactive
Sec residues but not Cys residues due to the difference
in pKa between Sec (pKa 5.2) and Cys (pKa 8.0).
Treatment with compounds 4 or 5 resulted in a decrease
in TrxR activity over time (top panel of Figure 7),
which correlated with a prevention of BIAM alkylation
(bottom panel of Figure 7).

which agrees well with the notion that TrxR inhibition
can lead to Nrf2 activation, as recently discussed
elsewhere in further detail [40]. Our assessments of the
compounds’ effects on TrxR, Trx, GR and GPx had both
demonstrated target selectivity, as only TrxR was among
these enzymes inhibited by the compounds in vitro, and
Nrf2 activation, as the cellular activities of these other
Nrf2-induced enzymes were increased in a cellular
context together with inhibition of TrxR.
As the indolin-2-one compounds irreversibly
inhibited TrxR, this suggested that covalent binding
occurred between the compounds and a nucleophilic
Sec, or possibly Cys residue in TrxR. The sustained
juglone reduction activity of the inhibited enzyme,
as well as the BIAM assay results, were findings that
would be compatible with preferential targeting at the
Sec residue of TrxR. This effect can also explain the
cytotoxicity of these compounds, most likely being due
to a rapidly triggered oxidative stress resulting in both
specific signaling events leading to apoptosis as well as
necrotic cell death.
We propose that oxidative stress upon indolin2-one-mediated TrxR inhibition can be triggered via
several specific pathways. Firstly, as inferred from
results obtained from the juglone reduction assay,
treatment with compounds 4 and 5 can result in
formation of SecTRAPs, thereby converting TrxR to
a prooxidant NADPH oxidase. Indeed, as it had been
observed previously for 1-chloro-2,4,-dinitrobenzene
(DNCB) or cisplatin, the formation of SecTRAPs in
cells can result in rapid induction of oxidative stress
leading to cell death [45, 49]. Secondly, increased
levels of oxidized Trx (as a result of TrxR inhibition)
should prevent Trx of providing reducing equivalents
to peroxiredoxins, which will further aggravate the
oxidative stress as a result of impaired antioxidant
defense. Furthermore, our results were compatible
with the effects of increased Trx oxidation leading
to dissociation of Trx-ASK1 complexes, followed by
activation of ASK1 and its downstream JNK and p38
MAPK signaling pathways leading to apoptotic cell
death induction [43, 50]. Indeed, dissociation of the
ASK1-Trx complex in HCT 116 cells upon treatment
with compound 4 was observed in our study. As
treatment with lead indolin-2-one compounds also
resulted in a dose-dependent increase in levels of
activated p38 and JNK, this showed involvement of
these two MAPK signaling cascades in mediating cell
death induced by these compounds.
In summary, Michael acceptor-based com­
pounds are a class of TrxR inhibitors that possess
electrophilicities to target nucleophilic Sec and Cys
residues in the active sites of mammalian TrxR. Examples
of several reported TrxR inhibitors that bear a Michael
acceptor moiety [44, 47, 51-56] are illustrated in Figure
8. This study has evaluated a series of Michael acceptor-

DISCUSSION
We previously reported that hydroxy and fluorine
substitutions render strong TrxR inhibitory character
to cinnamaldehydes and compounds containing a
1,5-diphenyl-pent-1-en-3-one (DDPen) or 1,3-diphenylprop-1-en-3-one (DPPro; also known as chalcone)
pharmacophore [47, 48]. In the present study, the
evaluated indolin-2-one compounds contain the
3-(2-oxopropylidene)indolin-2-one backbone, which
possesses two conjugated α,β-unsaturated carbonyl
groups as Michael acceptors. We found a majority of the
compounds displayed a good correlation between antiproliferative activities toward two human cancer cell
lines and TrxR inhibition, which has several important
implications.
It is notable that several of the indolin-2-one
compounds studied here are also Nrf2 inducers [39],

based indolin-2-one compounds and identified lead
compounds 4 and 5 carrying a N-butyl and N-benzyl
substituent, respectively, to display the strongest
TrxR inhibitory and anti-proliferative activities. Their
selectivity towards inhibition of cellular TrxR activity
was mediated through targeting the Sec residue in
the enzyme’s C-terminal active site. Mechanistically,
the cytotoxicities of these lead indolin-2-one analogs
were mediated at least in part through TrxR inhibition

and Trx oxidation, followed by ASK1-dependent
activation of p38 and JNK MAPK signaling pathways
(summarized in Figure 9). Importantly, this study has
provided experimental evidence attesting that appropriate
structural modifications to compounds bearing the
indolinone chemical scaffold, particularly substitutions
at the nitrogen atom, can yield derivatives that possess
specific TrxR inhibitory activity as leads for anticancer
drug development.

Figure 9: A summary of cellular events resulting from TrxR inhibition caused by treatment with indolin-2-one
compounds. TrxR inhibition by indolin-2-one compounds led to formation of SecTRAPs and Trx oxidation. SecTRAPs lacking Trx
reducing activity of TrxR could lead to enhanced ROS production and trigger a mixture of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Trx
oxidation further led to dissociation of ASK1 from Trx(reduced)-ASK1 complexes, followed by ASK1-dependent activation of MAPK
signaling pathways, resulting in cell death.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Determination of recombinant rat TrxR activity
by DTNB reduction assay

Materials, chemicals and cell culture

In a volume of 100 µl of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2
mM EDTA buffer (TE buffer), compounds of concentrations
1-100 µM were incubated with 100 nM recombinant rat
TrxR and 200 µM NADPH at room temperature in 96-well
plates for 30 and 60 min. The incubation was terminated
by addition of 100 µl per well of 10 mM DTNB, 200 µM
NADPH solution in TE buffer and immediately followed
by measurement of linear increase of absorbance at 412 nm
for the initial 2 min using the VersaMax microplate reader
(Molecular Devices). The results were expressed as % of
TrxR activity of drug-treated sample over that of DMSO
control. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values
were calculated.

Recombinant rat TrxR was prepared as previously
described [57]. Recombinant human Trx (rhTrx1) and
anti-human Trx antibody were obtained from IMCO
Corporation (Stockholm, Sweden). Iodoacetamide (IAA),
yeast glutathione reductase (GR), bovine glutathione
peroxidase (GPx), glutathione disulfide (GSSG),
reduced glutathione (GSH) and trypsin of proteomics
grade were purchased from Sigma. 5-(and-6)-carboxy2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxyH2DCFDA), BIAM and HRP-conjugated streptavidin
were from Molecular Probes and bovine insulin was
from Gemini Bio-Products. Antibodies against Nrf2,
full-length and cleaved caspase 3, full-length and cleaved
poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP), JNK, phosphoJNK (Thr183/Tyr185), p38 and phospho-p38 (Thr180/
Tyr182) were from Cell Signaling Technology, while
those specific for human TrxR1, ASK1 and β-actin and
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Human-derived colon HCT 116
and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium, MRC-5 normal lung fibroblasts
in MEM and wild-type (Keap1+/+) and Keap1−/− MEFs
were cultured in IMDM containing epidermal growth
factor (EGF; 1 µg per 100 ml medium). All media were
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/
ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The cells were
incubated at 37ºC in an humidified atmosphere of 95%
air and 5% CO2. Indolin-2-one compounds 1 to 20 were
previously synthesized and were all at least 95% pure as
assessed by HPLC-MS and 1H NMR [39]. They were
kept as 50 mM DMSO stocks at -20°C and diluted fresh
in DMSO or culture medium to the final concentrations
immediately before all experiments.

Determination of juglone reduction by
recombinant rat TrxR
The assay, designed to determine the ability of
mammalian TrxR to reduce juglone at the N-terminal
active center, was performed as described previously [44,
45]. Briefly, 2 µl of diluted DMSO stocks of compounds 4
and 5 (final concentrations 1-100 µM) were incubated in
198 µl of 15 nM recombinant rat TrxR, 250 µM NADPH
and 0.1 mg/ml BSA in TE buffer at room temperature
in 96-well plates for 15 min. 100 mM stock solution of
juglone in DMSO was prepared fresh for each experiment
and diluted in TE buffer to a 300 µM working solution.
The incubation was terminated by the addition of 100 µl
of 300 µM juglone solution (final concentration 100 µM),
and NADPH consumption was monitored at 340 nm for
5 min using the VersaMax microplate reader. The linear
decrease in NADPH absorbance was used for calculating
juglone reduction activity. The results were expressed
as % of TrxR juglone reduction activity of drug-treated
sample over that of DMSO-treated sample.
The experiments were performed at the same
time with a corresponding DTNB reduction assay as
described above with modifications so as to keep the
experimental parameters and conditions similar to those
in the juglone reduction assay. Performing the DTNB
reduction assay together with the juglone reduction assay
ensured that any amount of TrxR inhibition registered in
each assay could be directly cross-compared with each
other at the same time. Following 15 min incubation
with compound 4 or 5, 50 µl of 8.75 µM DTNB solution
(final concentration 1.75 µM) was added to each well
and DTNB reduction was measured at 412 nm for 2 min.

Cell viability assay
HCT 116 and MCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at a density of 1 x 104 cells/well and allowed to grow
for 20-24 h before addition of test compounds. DMSO
stocks of indolin-2-one compounds were serially diluted in
medium each time an assay was performed. Cell viability
was determined at the time of compound addition (time
0) and after 72 h of compound treatment by reduction
of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) by dehydrogenases in viable cells. MTT
was added into each well (final concentration 400 µg/
ml) and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The
supernatants were aspirated and upon solubilization of
the formed formazan crystals in DMSO:glycine buffer pH
10.5 (ratio 4:1), absorbance at 550 nm was measured. 50%
growth inhibition concentrations (GI50) and 50% lethal
concentrations (LC50) values were calculated.

DMSO stocks of juglone and compounds 4 and 5 was
added to final concentrations of 8 µM (for julgone) and
100 µM (for compounds 4 and 5). The consumption of
NADPH was immediately monitored at 340 nm for 20
min using the VersaMax microplate reader. The linear
decrease in NADPH absorbance was used for calculating
NADPH consumption and expressed as % of activity of
drug-treated sample over that of DMSO-treated sample.

that the cell lysates were incubated for 20 min with 300
nM recombinant rat TrxR in place of rhTrx1. Controls
containing lysates and all reaction reagents except
recombinant rat TrxR for each lysate sample were also set
up. For each sample, Trx or TrxR activity was calculated
as the absorbance at 412 nm subtracted from that of the
corresponding control and expressed as a percentage of the
activity measured in DMSO-treated cells.

Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot
analysis

Determination of yeast GR activity and GR
activity in cell lysates by glutathione reduction
assay

Cells were seeded onto 100 mm or 60 mm culture
plates and upon reaching ~70% confluency, they were
subjected to drug treatment for indicated durations. Pellets
of compound-treated or DMSO control cells comprising
both attached and floating cells were collected and lysed in
lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5
mM EDTA, 2.5 mM EGTA, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4,
20 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, 0.5% Triton X-100) with freshly added
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Prior to
being used in Western blot analysis and/or cellular TrxR,
GR, Trx and GPx activity determination, lysates were
precleared by centrifugation and protein concentrations
were determined using a modified Bradford assay (BioRad Laboratories) as described in the manufacturer’s
manual. This procedure for collecting whole cell lysate
was used for all experiments except for the Trx-redox
state determination experiment. Equal amounts of protein
(50 µg) in each lysate sample were separated by SDSPAGE, followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose
membranes. Electroblotted proteins on membranes were
probed with a primary antibody and subsequently by a
secondary antibody conjugated to HRP.

To determine in vitro yeast GR activity,
compounds of concentrations 1-100 µM were incubated
with 20 nM yeast GR and 200 µM NADPH in a volume
of 100 µl phosphate buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate,
2 mM EDTA pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature.
At the end of the incubation, 100 µl of 1 M GSSG
(final concentration 500 µM) and 200 µM NADPH
in phosphate buffer was added to each well. NADPH
consumption was monitored by measurement of
absorbance at 340 nm using the VersaMax microplate
reader. The results were calculated based on decrease
in absorbance in the initial 90 s and expressed as a
percentage of the enzyme activity of the DMSO-treated
sample. For determination of cellular GR activity, 25
µg of cell lysate was mixed with a solution of GSSG
and NADPH in phosphate buffer to a final volume of
200 µl (final GSSG and NADPH concentrations 1 mM
and 200 µM respectively). The enzyme activity was
determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance
at 340 nm for 10 min at 37°C and expressed as a
percentage of the enzyme activity of that of the DMSOtreated sample.

Determination of TrxR and Trx activity in cell
lysates by insulin reduction assay

Determination of bovine GPx activity and GPx
activity in cell lysates by GPx activity assays

Freshly collected cell lysates were used for
measurement of activity of cellular Trx and TrxR. To
measure TrxR activity, in each well of a 96-well plate, 25
µg of cell lysate was incubated in a final volume of 50 µl
containing 85 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 0.3 mM insulin, 10
µM rhTrx1, 2.5 mM EDTA and 660 µM NADPH for 40
min at 37°C. Controls containing lysates and all reaction
reagents except rhTrx1 for each lysate sample were also
set up. 200 µl of 1 mM DTNB in 6 M guanidine-HCl,
200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 solution was added to quench
the reaction. The amount of free thiols generated from
insulin reduction was determined by DTNB reduction
at 412 nm using the VersaMax microplate reader. To
measure Trx activity, procedures were carried out similar
to those for determining cellular TrxR activity, except

For determination of in vitro bovine GPx activity,
compounds of concentrations 1-100 µM were incubated
with 100 nM bovine GPx, 20 nM yeast GR, 1 mM GSH
and 200 µM NADPH in a volume of 100 µl phosphate
buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, 2 mM EDTA pH 7.5) for
1 h at room temperature. H2O2 solution in phosphate buffer
was added to initiate the reaction (final concentration 1.5
mM). NADPH consumption was monitored at 340 nm
using the VersaMax microplate reader. The cellular GPx
activity was determined similarly except lysates of HCT
116 and MCF-7 cells (25 µg protein) were used instead of
bovine GPx. The results were calculated based on decrease
in absorbance in the initial 3 min and presented as % of
GPx activity of drug-treated sample over that of DMSOtreated sample.

Determination of total cellular thiols

6-well plates and incubated for 24-48 h at 37°C till 7080% confluency. They were treated with H2O2 (200 µM) or
compounds 4 and 5 (20, 30, 40 or 50 µM) for 3 h. Following
treatment, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with
10 µM carboxy-H2DCFDA in PBS at 37°C in the dark for
45 min to allow reaction between taken up H2DCF and ROS.
The cells were collected, washed with cold PBS, pelleted,
resuspended in 200 µl of PBS and transferred to wells in a
96-well black fluorescence plate. The fluorescence intensities
were measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and
an emission wavelength of 530 nm using a Tecan Infinite
M200 Pro microplate reader. The results were expressed as a
percentage of fluorescence intensities measured in drug-treated
cells over those produced in DMSO-treated cells.

HCT 116 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and
allowed to grow to 70-80% confluency. They were treated
with compounds 4 and 5 (20, 30, 40 or 50 µM) for 4 h, after
which collected lysates were used fresh for total cellular
thiol determination. Briefly, in each well of a 96-well plate,
10 µl of each lysate sample was mixed with 90 µl of 1 mM
DTNB in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0.
Absorbance readings measured at 412 nm were matched
against a calibration plot obtained from a series of serially
diluted GSH solutions (known concentrations in µM) in 50
mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 7.5. The calculated total
thiol content, normalized to per mg of proteins present
in each lysate sample of compound-treated cells, was
expressed as a percentage over that in DMSO-treated cells.

BIAM labeling assay

Immunoprecipitation

To assess whether the Sec residue in mammalian TrxR
was susceptible to indolin-2-one compounds, biotin labeling
through BIAM alkylation of the free selenol at pH 6.5 in
recombinant rat TrxR was performed using a previously
described method with modifications [46]. A 100 µM
BIAM stock solution in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 6.5 was prepared fresh for each experiment. NADPHreduced recombinant rat TrxR (0.9 µM) was incubated with
compound 4 or 5 (20 µM) or DMSO vehicle in 50 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and 200 µM NADPH at 37°C.
At indicated timepoints, a 3 µl aliquot was withdrawn and
mixed with 20 µM BIAM solution in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1
mM EDTA, pH 6.5 for 15 min at 37°C to allow selective
alkylation of free Sec residues. The reaction was quenched
by adding freshly prepared IAA solution (final concentration
50 mM). The samples were then denatured in SDS sample
buffer, boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting. The biotin was detected by HRP-conjugated
streptavidin using the enhanced chemiluminescence system.
Membranes were stripped with stripping buffer (0.15 M
glycine, pH 2.5, 0.4% SDS) and reprobed with polyclonal
anti-rat TrxR1 antibody purified from rabbit antiserum
against rat liver TrxR1 [59]. At each timepoint, 15 µl of
compound-treated 	TrxR mixture was also removed for TrxR
activity determination using the DTNB assay.

HCT 116 cells were seeded in 60 mm plates and upon
reaching 40% confluency, they were transfected with 1.5 µg
of pCMV-SPORT6-ASK1 per plate. When the transfected
cells reached ~70% confluency, they were treated with
DMSO or compound 4 at indicated concentrations for 4 h
and lysates were collected for immunoprecipitation set-up.
For each lysate sample, a volume containing 1 mg of protein
was mixed with 1.5 µg of anti-Trx antibody coupled to 20
µl of protein G-sepharose (GE Healthcare) and tumbled
at 4°C for 2 h. The G-sepharose beads were washed three
times in a cold washing buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH
7.5), 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mM EGTA and once in a buffer
containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5). The immunoprecipitated
proteins were denatured in SDS sample buffer containing
5% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE and
Western blotting.

Determination of Trx redox state in cells
The redox state of cellular Trx was assessed as
previously described [42]. HCT 116 cells were seeded
in 60 mm plates and allowed to grow to 70% confluency.
Compounds 4 or 5 were then added to the cells for 4, 8 or 14
h. Lysates were collected in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.3, 2 mM EDTA, 6 M guanidine HCl, 0.5% Triton-X,
50 mM IAA). The lysates were incubated in the dark for
30 min at room temperature, sonicated briefly, and finally
passed through a MicroSpin G-25 column (GE Healthcare)
to remove guanidine and unreacted IAA. The desalted lysates
were subjected to native PAGE, followed by transfer of
separated proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes for Western
blot analysis using anti-Trx antibody.

Statistical and densitometric analysis
Numerical data are presented as means ± SD of
different determinations. Student’s t-test analysis was
performed to compare means between control and
treatment groups. ImageJ software (NIH) was used for
quantification of intensities of Western blot bands.
