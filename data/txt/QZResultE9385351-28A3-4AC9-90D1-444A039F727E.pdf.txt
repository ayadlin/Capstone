BACKGROUND: The use of central venous catheters (CVCs) has greatly improved the quality of care in children with
cancer, yet these catheters may cause serious infectious and thrombotic complications. The aim of this prospective
registry study was to assess the host and CVC-related risk factors for CVC-created thrombotic complications.
METHODS: Patients undergoing CVC insertion for chemotherapy were followed prospectively for CVC complications.
At the time of enrollment, demographic, clinical, and CVC-related data, and family history of thrombosis were collected. Survival and Cox regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 423 CVCs were inserted into 262
patients for a total of 76,540 catheter days. The incidence of CVC-related deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) was 0.13 per
1000 catheter-days (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.24). Insertion of peripherally inserted central catheters
(PICCs) and insertion in an angiography suite significantly increased the risk of symptomatic CVC-related DVT. The
incidence of CVC occlusion was 1.35 per 1000 catheter-days (95% CI, 1.1-1.63). Positive family history of thrombosis
significantly increased the risk of CVC occlusion (hazard ratio [HR], 2.16; 95% CI, 1.2-3.8). The CVC-related risk factors
were insertion of Hickman catheters, insertion in angiography suite, and proximal-tip location. Patients developing at
least 1 episode of both CVC occlusion and infection had an increased risk for developing symptomatic CVC-related
DVT (HR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.2-14.4). CONCLUSIONS: Both patient-related and CVC-related factors are associated with
higher risk of symptomatic thrombotic complications. These risk factors could be used in the clinical setting and in

Children with cancer require intravenous administration of chemotherapy and other therapies for a considerable period of time. Repeated venipunctures are poorly tolerated by children and by their veins. The introduction of central venous catheters (CVCs) in the 1980s significantly improved the quality of life of pediatric oncology patients.1,2 However,
the use of these CVCs has been associated with mechanical, infectious, and thrombotic complications.
The rate of thrombotic complications related to CVCs in children treated with chemotherapy was previously
reported in 2 cohort studies.3,4 The cumulative risk (CR) of CVC-related deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) was 0.06 and
0.18 per 1000 catheter-days, and the CR of CVC occlusion was 0.78 and 2.0 per 1000 catheter-days. In children with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic CVC-related DVT was found in children treated with asparaginase and prednisone5,6 and with insertion to the left side and to the subclavian vein.7 Although
CVC-related thrombotic complications in pediatric cancer patients are not rare events, the clinical impact and risk factors
for these complications are not clear. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the host, underlying disease and

CVC-related risk factors for symptomatic thrombotic
complications in a large cohort of pediatric patients
undergoing CVC insertion for chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
A registry of patients undergoing CVC insertion for
chemotherapy treatment was initiated in June 2006 in the
3 largest pediatric hematology/oncology centers in Israel.
Each patient undergoing CVC insertion for treatment of
a newly diagnosed cancer, relapsed cancer, or for bone
marrow transplantation (BMT) was eligible for registration in this study, and the only exclusion criterion for this
study was the lack of consent to participate. The study was
approved by the local institution review board of each participating center.
Data collection
Patients

An initial registration form was completed for each
participating patient. This form included questions on demographic, clinical, and CVC-related data, and family
history of thrombosis. Family history of thrombosis was
considered positive when there was a report of any first
and/or second degree family member with DVT, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and/or stroke at a
young age (<40 years),8 recurrent abortions (3) and/or
laboratory diagnosis of inherited or acquired thrombophilia. Patients were followed from the day of enrollment
until removal of the last CVC, death, last follow-up, or at
study closure, when none of the above occurred.
CVCs

For each CVC insertion, the following data were
collected: date of insertion, type of CVC, place of procedure, side of insertion, vein cannulated, and location of
the tip of the catheter. Decisions related to CVC insertion
were made by the treating physician and were based
mainly on personal preferences and underlying patient
characteristics. The insertion and maintenance of CVCs
was in accordance with institutional protocols. Routine
thromboprophylaxis was not used in the participating
centers. If the CVC was removed during the study period,
the date and cause of removal were recorded. When a new
CVC was inserted during the study period, the new CVCrelated data were recorded.
For documentation of CVC-related complications,
the following events were reported to the registry: (1)

4198

occlusion of the CVC, defined as an inability to infuse
and/or withdraw blood, requiring medical, ie, local installation of thrombolysis therapy, or surgical intervention,
ie, CVC removal; (2) venous thrombosis, suspected by
the primary physician and confirmed by diagnostic imaging; (3) infection, including all cases of positive blood culture from the CVC drawn in case of fever or clinical sign
suspected for infection. Concurrent peripheral blood culture was not routinely drawn. For coagulase-negative
staphylococci, a common skin contaminant, only cases
where 2 or more blood cultures were positive and drawn
on separate occasions were considered true infection.9
Tests for inherited thrombophilia

Protein C and antithrombin activities were measured by chromogenic assays (Baxter Dade, Bonnstrasse,
Switzerland). Free protein-S antigen was measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Gradipore
Elisa test kit; Riverside Corporate Park, Australia). Only
repeatedly low-for-age values established the diagnosis of
a coagulation inhibitor deficiency. Factor V Leiden,
C677T gene polymorphism in the MTHFR and G20210A
substitution in the factor II gene were detected as previously described.10-13
Data analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study
cohort are reported with 95% confidence intervals. The
association between the type of CVC and other variables
in the analysis was analyzed by using the ANOVA test for
continuous data, ie, age, and chi-square test for categorical
data, ie, underlying disease, place of procedure, side of
insertion, vein cannulated, and place of the tip. As the age
variable was found to be skewed to the right, a z ¼ square
root of y transformation gave an approximately normal
distribution. Groups of underlying diagnosis were predefined including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), myeloid leukemia (acute and juvenile myelomonocytic
leukemia), brain tumors, sarcoma (Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma), neuroblastoma, lymphoma (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin), bone-marrow
transplantation (BMT), and other (occurring in 5 children). The grouping was based on similar treatment
modalities for similar types of cancers.
Analysis of the risks of CVC-related thrombotic
complications was performed separately for host-related
and CVC-related factors. First, the risk (with 95% CI) of
a patient to develop at least 1 episode of the outcome was
calculated, the numerator being all patients who had at

least 1 episode of outcome and the denominator being
patient-days at risk. Patient-days were the sum of followup from time of enrollment to time of removal of the last
CVC, death, last follow-up, or study closure when none
of the above occurred. Second, the risk of each CVC (with
95% CI) to develop the outcome was calculated. The numerator was all CVCs that had at least 1 episode of the
outcome, and the dominator was catheter-days at risk.
Catheter-days were the sum of follow-up from time of
CVC insertion to the CVC removal, death, last followup, or study closure when none of the above occurred. For
both analyses, a Kaplan-Meier curve was computed, and
the 1-year CR to develop the outcome was established. The
log-rank test was used to compare survival by categories of
study variables. Finally, a Cox regression model was computed to quantify the independent contribution of 1 or
more factors of interest on survival, expressed as the hazard
ratio (HR). For host-related factors, the following variables
were considered: age, underlying diagnosis, family origin,
family history of thrombosis and thrombophilia. For
CVC-related factors, the following variables were considered: type of CVC, place of procedure, side of insertion,
vein cannulated, and location of the tip. To avoid multicolinearity, a univariate analysis for all other CVC-related
variables was computed separately for each type of CVC. A

separate model was computed for the association between
CVC-related DVT, occlusion, and infection.
The study was funded for 2 years by a grant from the
Israeli Cancer Association. In these 2 years, we planned to
recruit 300 patients undergoing CVC insertion for chemotherapy. Statistical analysis were performed by using the
SPSS 14.0 for Windows (release 14.0.1, November 2005;
SPSS, Chicago, Ill) and the WINPEPI (PEPI-for-Windows, version 2.8, March 2007; PEPI, Programs for EPIdemiologists; freeware for Windows, developed for DOS
computers by Joseph H Abramson, School of Public
Health and Community Medicine, Hebrew University,
Jerusalem, Israel).14 Missing data were not included in the
analysis. Taking into account the multiple comparisons in
this study, only a 2-tailed P value of <.01 was considered
statistically significant. Bonferroni post hoc correction
was performed for the subgroup analysis of study subjects
who had undergone thrombophilia testing.

RESULTS
Patients
A total of 262 patients were enrolled to the registry with a
median age of 7.42 years (range, 28 days to 28 years).
Eighteen young adult patients (older than 18 years of age)
were included because they were treated in a pediatric oncology center for pediatric types of tumors, mainly sarcoma. Patients were followed for a total of 77,798
patient-days. The main patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Questions about the family history of
thrombosis were completed in 234 (89%) patients and
were positive for thrombosis in 24 (10.3%) patients (95%
CI, 6.7%-14.9%).
CVC type and insertion
The types of CVC inserted were Hickman catheters in
104 (24%), Port-a-Caths in 126 (30%), and peripherally
inserted central catheters (PICCs) in 188 (45%). In 5
cases, the type of CVC was not recorded. The CVC duration ranged from 1 day to 744 days for a total of 76,540
catheter-days. The number and median duration of CVC
per patient is presented in Table 1. Age, underlying disease, and insertion data were significantly associated with
the type of CVC (Table 2).

per patient from enrollment was 38%. Family history of
thrombosis was significantly associated with at least 1 episode of occlusion (Fig. 1). The HR (95% CI) for positive
family history of thrombosis was 2.16 (1.21-3.84;) P ¼

Occlusion of the CVC occurred in 102 CVCs with
an incidence of 1.35 (95% CI, 1.1-1.63) per 1000 catheter-days. The 1-year CR for first occlusion per catheter
from insertion was 37%. Obstruction of the CVC was the
cause for its removal in 21 cases. The risk of at least 1
occlusion was associated with the type of CVC with a 1year CR of 54%, 40%, and 18% for Hickman catheters,
Port-a-Caths, and PICCs, respectively (P ¼ .002). The
HR (95% CI) for occlusion of Port-a-Caths and Hickman
catheters compared with PICCs was 1.8 (1.11-2.96) and

Venous thrombosis
Fourteen events of venous thrombosis occurred in 13 children during the study period (Table 3). CVC-related
DVT occurred in 10 patients with an incidence of 0.13
(95% CI, 0.06-0.24) per 1000 patient-days. The 1-year
CR for CVC-related DVT per patient was 4.6%. Age,
underlying diagnosis, family origin, and family history of
thrombosis were not associated with CVC-related DVT.
A higher rate of CVC-related DVT was found in PICCs
compared with Hickman catheters and Port-a-Caths with
a 1-year CR of 5.3% for PICCs and 1.9% for other CVC
types (Fig. 2). The risk of CVC-related DVT was also
associated with place of procedure with 1-year CR of
11.3% and 0.5% for the angiography suite and operating
room, respectively (Table 4). Other CVC-related variables were not significant (Table 4). As the type of the
CVC and place of procedure were found to be highly correlated (Table 2); multivariate analysis was not
performed.
Of 10 patients with CVC-related DVT, 6 had at
least 1 episode of occlusion, and 8 had at least 1 episode of
infection. Patients developing at least 1 episode of both
occlusion and infection had a trend for an increased rate
for developing CVC-related DVT (Fig. 3). The HR (95%
CI) was 4.15 (1.2-14.37) for patients with both infection

and occlusion compared with patients with 1 type or no
previous event (P ¼ .039).
Thrombophilia studies
Because of financial constraints, blood test for thrombophilia were performed in a subgroup of 85 (32%) patients
that included the majority of patients seen in 1 of the centers and patients with ALL and DVT from all centers. As
such, thrombophilia screening was performed more often
in patients with ALL (47% vs 28% with other malignancies), with DVT (85% vs 30.4% without), with at least 1
CVC occlusion (42% vs 28% without), and less often in
patients with sarcoma (17% vs 37% with other malignancies). The median age, family origin, and positive family
history of thrombosis were similar between those with
and without thrombophilia screening.
A positive thrombophilia screen was found in 21
(25%) patients (95% CI, 16%-35%), more frequently in
patients of Arab origin (43%) compared with patients of
Jewish origin (13%) (P ¼ .006). Positive thrombophilia
was not associated with CVC-related DVT or CVC
occlusion. As in the total study population, in the subgroup of children who had thrombophilia testing, patients
with a family history of thrombosis were more likely to
have at least 1 episode of occlusion, 100%, compared
with patients with no family history of thrombosis, 37%
(P ¼ .01, after Bonferroni correction).

Scoring algorithm
Based on the results of our cohort, we attempted to develop a scoring algorithm for prediction of CVC occlusion (Table 5, part A). Of the 418 CVCs (5 other types of
CVCs were excluded), 170 (41%) CVCs scored 0, 216
(51.5%) CVCs scored 1, and 32 (7.5%) scored 2. Final
scores of 2 and 1 were associated with a higher risk for
CVC occlusion (Table 5, part B).

DISCUSSION
This study was designed to assess the host and CVCrelated risk factors for the development of CVC-related
thrombotic complications in patients treated with chemotherapy for cancer and BMT. We found that the risk of
occlusion was strongly associated with a family history of
thrombosis, type of CVC, place (eg, angio suite) of procedure, and placement of the tip. The risk of CVC-related
DVT was also associated with type of CVC and place of
procedure. We believe that the recognition of these risk
factors is important for future prevention and risk reduction of CVC-related thrombotic complications.
The use of PICCs was associated with higher rates of
CVC-related DVT and lower rates of occlusions compared with Port-a-Caths and Hickman catheters. A lower
rate of occlusion with PICCs could be related to their
shorter duration (Table 1) compared with Port-a-Caths
and Hickman catheters. An association between PICCs

and DVT was found in cancer patients15,16 and acute-care
surgical patients.17 Yet, in children without cancer, symptomatic and asymptomatic CVC-related DVT were not
associated with the type of CVC.18 The difference could
be related to the different study populations and the inclusion of asymptomatic cases. The increased rate of PICCrelated DVT can be viewed according to 2 perspectives.
The first assumes that the increased rate is real because the
PICCs cause more endothelial damage due to a relatively
high catheter:vein diameter ratio.19 Another possibility is
that the PICCs were inserted in sicker patients, who had a
higher risk for DVT. The second assumes that the
increased rate in PICCs is due to diagnostic bias; upperarm DVT is usually symptomatic, whereas DVTs in internal veins, ie, jugular or subclavian veins, are less likely to
be symptomatic.6 Because we did not perform systematic
screening for asymptomatic DVT, this question could not
be assessed in our study. For clinical purposes, currently,
only symptomatic CVC-related DVTs are treated with
anticoagulant therapy,20 a major therapeutic issue in
patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.
Emerging evidence for higher risk for post-thrombotic

syndrome after asymptomatic CVC-related DVT could
change this recommendation.21 Meanwhile, we believe
that because of the higher risk for symptomatic CVCrelated DVT the use of PICCs should be carefully
considered.
Traditionally, CVCs were inserted by a surgical service that used either a percutaneous puncture or a cutdown technique guided by anatomic landmarks. Increasingly, interventional radiology services are inserting
CVCs.22,23 It was recommended that an ultrasound,
image-guided, percutaneous technique for radiologic
insertion of CVC should be used to decrease thrombotic
complications.24,25 As an ultrasound, image-guided, percutaneous technique was not routinely used, and its use
was not recorded, we cannot conclude that the lack of its
use is the cause for increased rates of thrombotic complications in angiographically placed CVC.
The incidence of CVC occlusion was relatively high,
especially in Hickman catheters and in Port-a-Caths. In
our study and others, the location of the catheter tip in the
superior vena cava was found to be a significant risk factor,
especially in Port-a-Caths.26-28 Thus, when the CVC is
inserted, a major effort should be made to ensure that the
tip is not located in the superior vena cava. Family history
of thrombosis was recently proven to be an independent
risk factor for venous thrombosis.29 Similarly, in our
study, a positive family history of thrombosis was associated with occlusion. No association was found with CVCrelated DVT, possibly because of the lower rate of events.
Although thrombophilia is an important risk factor for venous thrombosis in children,30 thrombophilia status
seems to be less contributory for CVC-related thrombotic
complications.31 In a subgroup analysis of patients tested
for inherited thrombophilia, family history of thrombosis,
and not the results of thrombophilia tests, was a predictor
for CVC occlusion. Although not all in the cohort were
included in the thrombophilia analysis, we opine that the
results of this analysis are valid as similar rates of family
history of thrombosis were found in those children with
and without thrombophilia testing. Thus, in clinical practice, family history of thrombosis may be more useful for
risk assessment than a thrombophilia test.29 Family history of thrombosis (definition slightly different from
ours) was included in a scoring schema in a study of
thromboprophylaxis for children with ALL.32
The clinical impact of CVC occlusion is somewhat
controversial. Some suggest that CVC occlusion has little
impact on CVC longevity because it is resolved in most
cases by installation of local fibrinolytic therapy.3 Others

have found that CVC occlusion is associated with infection and with a higher risk for CVC-related DVT.4,33,34
Similarly, we found an association between occlusion,
infection, and later occurrence of CVC-related DVT.
Currently, low dose (10-100 IU/mL) heparin flushes are
used to prevent occlusions. A variety of additional regimens were studied in the attempt to prevent occlusions
with different rates of success.35-40 Which regimen would
be the best for reducing the rate of occlusions and infections and whether reducing the rate of these complications
will result in fewer CVC-related DVTs still need to be
studied in prospective studies. A scoring algorithm including data on the type of CVC, placement of the catheter
tip, and family history of thrombosis was found to be predictive for CVC occlusion. Before physicians use this scoring algorithm to make clinical decisions or in clinical
trials for prevention of occlusion, the score needs validation in other prospective cohorts.
Our study had some limitations. First, based on the
Israeli Pediatric Cancer registry the enrollment rate was
around 70%. The major reason for nonenrollment was
lack of communication to the study coordinators that a
new patient was to have a CVC insertion. All cases known
to the study coordinators were enrolled to this study, and
the lack of enrollment was not differential among cases
according to study variables. Despite this flaw, because
the age distribution and the frequency of the different
underlying diseases represent a typical population treated
in pediatric oncology centers, we believe that the external
validity of our study is acceptable. Second, the ascertainment of study outcomes was based on daily reports given
by the nurses. Although, we must assume that not all outcome events were captured, we believe that the number of
unreported events is similar across the study population.
Finally, the study captured only symptomatic CVCrelated DVT, mostly due to clinical symptoms and some
due to radiographic evaluation for fever, obstruction, or
routine testing; thus, the rate of CVC-related DVT was
probably an underestimate. As a consequence, some of the
‘‘negative’’ findings for CVC-related DVT could be due
to lack of power given the low number of events (ie, type
II error). The short-term and long-term effects of asymptomatic CVC-related DVT is still controversial21,41,42
and should be assessed in a future studies when the cancer
survivors will be tested for signs and symptoms of postthrombotic syndrome.
In conclusion, this study reports the incidence and
risk factors for CVC-related thrombotic complications in
a large, pediatric, oncology cohort. The association of

4204

CVC occlusion with positive family history of thrombosis
and with CVC-related DVT supports the concept that
CVC occlusion is, at least in part, a thrombotic event.
The results of this study could help physicians, nurses,
and families during the decision process involved in
choosing the type of central venous line to be inserted and
could be used in developing future studies for reducing
the rate of CVC-related complications.
