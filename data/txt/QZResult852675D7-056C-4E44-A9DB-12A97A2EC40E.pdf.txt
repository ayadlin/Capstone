Abstract

Clinical Management of Retinoblastoma

Studies on retinoblastoma have been at the heart of many of
the landmark discoveries in cancer genetics over the past
35 years. However, these advances in the laboratory have had
little effect on the treatment of children with retinoblastoma.
One of the reasons for this has been the lack of preclinical
models that recapitulated the genetic and histopathologic
features of human retinoblastoma. In the past three years, a
series of new animal models of retinoblastoma has been
developed and characterized from several different laboratories using a variety of experimental approaches. It is
encouraging that there is broad agreement about the
consequences of inactivation of the Rb family in retinal
development from these studies. More importantly, these new
mouse models of retinoblastoma have contributed to clinical
trials and novel therapeutic approaches for treating this
debilitating childhood cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(16):7547–50]

Retinoblastoma is virtually always fatal if left untreated due to
tumor metastasis. The objective of retinoblastoma treatment is to
save vision without risking the child’s life. Children with unilateral
retinoblastoma typically undergo surgical enucleation, whereas
children with bilateral retinoblastoma often receive a combination of chemotherapy and focal therapy (5). Today the focal
therapies that are most widely used include laser therapy,
cryotherapy, and brachytherapy (5). Every effort is made to avoid
or delay radiation therapy because of the side effects associated
with irradiating the surrounding tissue. In particular, children
with RB1 mutations are prone to secondary cancers later in life,
and DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation accelerates this
process.
One of the limitations with current clinical management of
retinoblastoma is that broad spectrum chemotherapy is given
systemically. This leads to significant dose-limiting side effects
that can be costly and difficult to manage. Current efforts are
focused on local delivery of chemotherapy, and early studies
using subconjunctival carboplatin have proved effective in the
clinic (6). Ideally, local delivery of targeted chemotherapy may
provide improved tumor response with minimal toxicity. The
recent development of animal models and identification of
molecular targets for chemotherapy have accelerated progress in
this area.

Introduction
In 1971 Knudson proposed that retinoblastoma was initiated by
inactivation of a putative tumor suppressor gene (1), and this
hypothesis was subsequently confirmed by demonstration of loss of
heterozygosity at 13q14 in retinoblastomas (2) and the cloning of
the first tumor suppressor gene RB1 (3). A few years later, Harbour
extended these findings to small cell lung cancer showing that the
RB1 locus was disrupted in tumors other than retinoblastoma and
osteosarcoma (reviewed in ref. 4). Since then, it has been found that
most, if not all, tumors have defects in their Rb pathway through
genetic lesions in the RB1 gene itself or other genes in the pathway.
The history of retinoblastoma research highlights how basic
research on a rare childhood cancer can have a much broader
effect on a disease that affects millions of people each year
worldwide.
Although we have learned a great deal about the Rb pathway and
its contribution to cancer over the past 35 years, our knowledge
should be better applied to treating retinoblastoma. Despite
advances in the clinical management of retinoblastoma in the
United States, there are still many children with advanced bilateral
retinoblastoma that lose one or both of their eyes. In developing
countries, 40% to 50% of children still lose their life to metastatic
retinoblastoma.

The First Knockout Mouse Models of
Retinoblastoma
One of the reasons that research on retinoblastoma and Rb
pathway has not had a greater effect on retinoblastoma treatment
has been the lack of preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate
genetic and histopathologic features of childhood retinoblastoma.
In 1992, three groups published papers describing the phenotype of
mice with a targeted deletion in their Rb1 gene (reviewed in ref. 4).
Unlike children who inherit a defective copy of the RB1 gene,
heterozygous mice failed to develop retinoblastoma. Chimeric
mouse studies carried out by Berns and colleagues several years
later showed that p107 suppressed retinoblastoma formation in
mice (reviewed in ref. 4). In 2004, three research groups generated
the first knockout mouse models of retinoblastoma by conditionally inactivating RbLox in the developing retinae of p107-deficient
mice using Nestin-Cre, Pax6-Cre, and Chx10-Cre (7–9). Inactivation
of Rb and p130 also led to retinoblastoma (7) showing for the first
time that p130 can suppress retinoblastoma in mice.
Interestingly, a previous attempt to generate a knockout mouse
model of retinoblastoma in IRBP-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p107 / mice was
unsuccessful (10). The fundamental difference between IRBP-Cre
and the other Cre transgenic lines mentioned above is the timing of
Cre expression during retinal development. IRBP-Cre is expressed

in cells committed to become photoreceptors just as they exit the
cell cycle. In contrast, Nestin-Cre, Pax6-Cre, and Chx10-Cre are all
expressed in retinal progenitor cells during development, suggesting that a retinal progenitor cell or a newly postmitotic cell distinct
from the photoreceptor lineage is the cell of origin for
retinoblastoma (discussed in ref. 11). Additional evidence for the
identification of retinal progenitor cell as the cell of origin for
retinoblastoma is the expression of retinal progenitor cell specific
markers in the tumors (12) and the strong bias toward deregulated
proliferation of Rb;p107-deficient retinal progenitor cells compared
with the newly postmitotic cells (12). These results highlight the
importance of combining studies on pediatric cancer with studies
on the normal development of that tissue.

The Role of the Rb Family in Retinal Development
In addition to the general agreement that both Rb and p107 or
Rb and p130 must be inactivated for retinoblastoma formation in
mice, there is similar agreement on the developmental roles for
the Rb family in the retina. Rb deletion in the developing retina
leads to inappropriate proliferation, increased apoptosis, and
differentiation defects including loss of rod photoreceptors (7, 9,
12–14). Rod photoreceptor loss has been observed in every study
in which Rb is inactivated in retinal progenitor cells, including
Nestin-Cre;Rb Lox/Lox , Pax6-Cre;Rb Lox/Lox , Chx10-Cre;Rb Lox/Lox ,
Mox-Cre;RbLox/Lox , and Rb-deficient retinal explants (7, 9, 12–14).
Similarly, acute inactivation of Rb in RbLox/Lox retinal progenitor
cells using replication incompetent retroviruses and square-wave
electroporation has provided similar results and has shown that
defective rod development is cell autonomous (12, 14). The only
model that failed to show rod photoreceptor loss was IRBPCre;RbLox/Lox retinae. This suggests that shortly after postmitotic
cells have committed to the rod fate, they no longer require Rb
and can develop normally. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vivo
lineage analysis in RbLox/ newborn pups using a replication
incompetent retrovirus that expresses Cre (LIA-Cre) showed that
some clones contained normal rods, and this proportion was
increased in pups ages 12 to 36 h (14).4
In both Pax6-Cre;RbLox/Lox and Chx10-CreLox/Lox retinae, normal
rods fail to form and cells in the outer nuclear layer (ONL)
express retinal progenitor cell markers and exhibit morphologic
features of retinal progenitor cells in electron micrographs
(12, 13).4 Photoreceptors are exceedingly sensitive to changes in
their local microenvironment such that the cell autonomous
requirement for Rb in rod maturation leads to noncell autonomous ONL degeneration in the developing retina, and this
varies depending on the extent of Rb inactivation in the ONL in a
particular retina. Indeed, there is some increased cell death
during early rod development and several days to weeks after the
normal period of rod maturation, degeneration in the ONL is
observed in Nestin-Cre;RbLox/Lox, Pax6-Cre;RbLox/Lox , and Chx10Cre;RbLox/Lox mice (7, 9, 12, 14). Studies using a point mutant
knock-in of Rb have shown that E2F1 and E2F3 are likely
candidates for regulating the rod-specific genes (15) and preliminary studies have shown that simultaneous inactivation of Rb
and E2F1 rescues the rod developmental defect.4 Rb-deficient
immature cells in the ONL are largely quiescent and only
occasionally reenter the cell cycle.

In addition to defective rod development, Pax-6 Cre;RbLox/Lox
retinas exhibit failure to exit the cell cycle despite the expression of
cell type–specific differentiation markers (9). Rb / retinal cells
ultimately exited the cell cycle or underwent cell death (7, 9, 12, 14).
It is not yet known if loss of cell types, such as bipolar and ganglion
cells in the developing Rb-deficient retina, is due to cell
autonomous effects, noncell autonomous effects, or a combination
of the two.

Distinct Roles for p107 and p130 in Murine
Retinoblastoma
The Rb family of proteins is made up of three members
(Rb, p107, and p130) that share some functional protein domains
and have overlapping roles in regulating growth control during
development (16). With additional mutation of p107 or p130,
levels of developmental proliferation and apoptosis increase and
animals become retinoblastoma prone (Fig. 1; refs. 7–9, 12, 17,
18). Although these studies have revealed similarities in the
effects of Rb deletion together with p130 or p107 loss, there are
also clear differences. Retinal disorganization upon Rb and p107
mutation starts at embryonic stages, whereas disorganization
occurs later, at postnatal stages in the absence of Rb and p130.
This is consistent with differences in the expression of p107 and
p130 throughout development, as p107 is more highly expressed
at embryonic stages, whereas p130 exhibits increased expression
at postnatal stages of retinal development (12). Chx10-Cre;RbLox/Lox;
p130 / and Pax6-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p130 / mice developed rapid
bilateral retinoblastoma with 100% penetrance (18),4 whereas
Chx10-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p107 / and Pax6-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p107 / animals
developed predominantly unilateral retinoblastoma with partial
penetrance and delayed onset of tumorigenesis. Tumor progression, with invasion of the optical nerve, lymph nodes, and brain
also occurred more rapidly in Pax6-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p130 / animals
compared with Pax6-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p107 / mice. These data
suggest that p130 is a stronger suppressor of retinoblastoma than
p107, and the Pax6-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p130 / animals may be particularly
useful as a preclinical model for advanced bilateral retinoblastoma
which presents the greatest challenge clinically.
A close examination of tumor emergence in the Pax6Cre;RbLox/Lox;p130 / model revealed that early lesions histologically resembling retinoblastoma at P21 and P31 were located at
the far retina periphery (18). The peripheral tumor localization
may reflect a specific cell of origin in this region, an aspect of
the regional environment permissive for tumor cell survival and/
or proliferation, or a property of Pax6-Cre expression. Tumors
emergence was not restricted to the peripheral retina in the
Chx10-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p130 / mice.4 Although it is possible that
the tumors result from a normally postmitotic cell in this region,
heterogeneity in the resulting tumors suggests that a multipotent
cell type may be responsible. A critical area for future work will
be to better define the nature of the cells giving rise to
retinoblastoma and the similarities and differences between
human retinoblastoma and the mouse models.

Species-Specific Differences in Retinoblastoma
Susceptibility
It has been well established that inactivation of the RB1 gene is
the initiating genetic lesion for retinoblastoma. However, as
mentioned above, Rb-deficient mouse retinoblasts do not form
retinoblastoma. Detailed characterization of the expression of the

with additional deletion of p107 or p130. Inset, Pax6-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p130 / mouse at age of 18 wks with bilateral retinoblastoma.

Rb family (Rb, p107, and p130) in the developing mouse and human
retina and analysis of intrinsic genetic compensation in Rbdeficient mouse and human retinoblasts has suggested a model to
account for this species-specific difference in retinoblastoma
susceptibility (12). In the developing mouse retina, p107 is the
major family member expressed in embryonic retinal progenitor
cells and Rb is the major family member expressed in postnatal
retinal progenitor cells (12). There is some overlapping expression
between Rb and p130 in the postnatal and adult mouse retina.
When Rb is inactivated in the developing mouse retina, p107 is
increased in a compensatory manner in many cells (12, 14). We
hypothesize that the inactivation of Rb is not sufficient for
retinoblastoma formation in the mouse due to intrinsic genetic
compensation by p107 or intrinsic genetic redundancy by p130. As
a result, retinoblastoma only forms in Rb;p107-deficient or Rb;p130deficient retinoblasts in the mouse retina. In the developing human
retina, RB1 is the major family member expressed. When RB1 is
inactivated, there is little, if any, compensation by p107 or p130.
This may explain why inactivation of RB1 is sufficient for
retinoblastoma formation in humans but not in mice.
Refinement of this model will require a fuller understanding of
the specific retinoblastoma-originating cells and the response of
such cells to Rb deletion. Whereas p107 increases occur in
postnatal stages of murine retinal development after Rb deletion,
this is not seen at embryonic stages (7, 12). In embryonic retinas,

www.aacrjournals.org

the levels of a critical regulator of p107 activity, cyclin D1, decreases
in response to Rb deletion, which may also restrain the effects of
Rb activity at the level of pocket protein activity. The developmental stage at which the cells in the retina are prone to tumor
initiation upon Rb family mutation is not known. Although these
studies clearly show that the genetics of Rb family inactivation is
different in humans and mice with respect to retinoblastoma
susceptibility, there is a common theme across species. In both
mice and humans, Rb family function must be inactivated to
initiate retinoblastoma; therefore, the preclinical models recapitulate these early events in retinoblastoma tumorigenesis.

Secondary Genetic Lesions in Retinoblastoma and
Targeted Chemotherapy
Whereas it has been well established that RB1 inactivation is the
initiating genetic lesion in retinoblastoma, only a handful of
secondary genetic lesions have been carefully analyzed. The newly
developed knockout mouse models of retinoblastoma provided a
critical tool to begin to identify secondary genetic lesions in
retinoblastoma. Using the Pax6-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p107 / and Pax6Cre;RbLox/Lox;p130 / models, it was recently found that N-myc also
undergoes gene amplification in murine retinoblastoma (18). The
N-myc oncogene has also been found to undergo gene amplification in a subset of human retinoblastomas. The frequency of

Cancer Research

N-myc amplification ( found in 5 of 61 tumors overall) is similar to
the frequency in human retinoblastomas (18). In tumors lacking
Rb and p130, N-myc amplification was associated with metastasis,
suggestive of a role for N-myc in tumor progression. Common
amplification of N-myc in murine and human retinoblastoma
provides further evidence that the murine models faithfully
recapitulate human disease.
It was also recently shown that Chx10-Cre;RbLox/ ;p107 / ;
p53Lox/ mice develop bilateral invasive aggressive retinoblastoma
with 100% penetrance. This is in contrast to Chx10-Cre;RbLox/ ;
p107 / mice that develop unilateral minimally invasive retinoblastoma with f50% penetrance. These data suggested that p53
suppressed retinoblastoma in mice. However, previous studies have
shown that the p53 gene was intact in human retinoblastomas.
Molecular genetic analyses revealed that the MDMX gene was
amplified in 65% of retinoblastoma cases and MDM2 was amplified
in an additional 10% (19). Using mouse models of retinoblastoma,
cultured retinoblastoma cell lines, human fetal retinae, and
primary retinoblastomas from enucleated eyes, it was confirmed
that amplification of MDMX suppresses p53-mediated cell death in
RB1-deficient retinoblasts and promotes clonal expansion of the
tumors. Whereas these findings do not rule out the possibility of
other nonapoptosis-related functions of p53 inactivation in
tumorigenesis, there is a clear connection between suppression of
p53-mediated apoptosis and retinoblastoma progression.
Not only do these data argue that retinoblastoma does not arise
from an intrinsically death resistant cell as previously proposed (9),
but it provided the first specific target for chemotherapy. Nutlin-3, a
small molecule inhibitor of MDM2 was found to bind to MDMX and
prevent it from binding to p53. Using some of the newly developed

preclinical models of retinoblastoma (20), Nutlin-3 was found to
have potent antitumor effects, especially when combined with
another drug that also induces a p53 response, topotecan (19). This
is the first example of a locally delivered targeted chemotherapy for
any pediatric cancer. Importantly, preclinical models were essential
for these studies on the basic biology of retinoblastoma and for
testing new drug combinations and methods of delivery.

Summary
The past three years have witnessed a remarkable advancement
in our understanding of retinoblastoma biology and the development of new therapeutic interventions. The field is rapidly moving
toward implementing locally delivered targeted therapies which
may improve outcomes while reducing toxicity associated with
radiotherapy or systemic broad-spectrum chemotherapy. These
advances have been built on the strong foundation of genetic
studies of retinoblastoma over the past several decades and have
been accelerated by the development of new mouse models of
retinoblastoma. It is encouraging that there is broad agreement
from independent laboratories using different approaches about
the role of Rb family in retinal development and retinoblastoma.
More importantly, these studies have raised exciting new questions
that will advance our understanding of tumorigenesis in the
developing central nervous system and the role or tumor
suppressor genes in normal developmental processes in the years
to come.
