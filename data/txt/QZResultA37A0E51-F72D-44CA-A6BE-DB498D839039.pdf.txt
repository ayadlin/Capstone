Abstract:

Cancer initiating cells have been described to be the only cell population with
tumorigenic capacity in glioblastoma multiforme, one of the most aggressive and
untreatable cancers. Recent work from our group described that NFκB pathway
was activated in glioblastoma initiating cells undergoing differentiation, and that
blockade of this activation promoted senescence of differentiating cells. NFκB
activation in cancer may be the result of either exposure to proinflammatory
stimuli in the tumor microenvironment or upregulation of the signaling pathway
by upstream regulators. Appropriate control of NFκB activity, which can be
achieved by gene modification or pharmacological strategies, would provide
a potential approach for the management of NFκB related tumors, including
glioblastoma. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of the relevance of
NFκB in cancer and its possible role as a target of therapeutic intervention.

NFκB SIGNALING

regulatory IKKγ (NEMO) subunit. The result of these
signaling events is the accumulation of the dimeric
NFκB transcription factor, containing mainly p50, p65
and c-Rel, in the nucleus where it is able to transactivate
different target genes among a large repertoire of more
than 200 genes implicated in cell survival/apoptosis,
cell growth, immune response, and inflammation. A
number of signaling pathways converge on these and
other NFκB regulators, providing multiple possibilities
for cancer cells to aberrantly activate this trancription
factor. Ever-increasing evidence has demonstrated that
both the recruitment of NFκB within the nucleus to target
genes and the ensuing transcriptional events are actively
regulated.
The application of knockout technology to the
NFκB pathway has had a major impact on our current
understanding of the function of individual components of
this signaling cascade. Nearly every technique available
for the manipulation of the mouse genome has been
employed for the analysis of the NFκB signaling pathway,
including the transgenic overexpression of activators or
inhibitors of NFκB, conventional and conditional gene
knockouts and also specific modifications of endogenous

NFκB has been associated with many disease states,
such as chronic inflammation, cancer, neurodegenerative
disorders, diabetes and stroke [1; 2]. NFκB proteins
comprise a family of structurally-related transcription
factors, including p50 (NFκB1), p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52
and RelB, all of which have a conserved N-terminal Rel
homology domain (RHD) that contains the DNA-binding
and dimerization regions. Only p65, RelB and c-Rel
contain potent transactivation domains within sequences
C-terminal to the RHD. Therefore, p50 and p52 can not
act as transcriptional activators by themselves. Dimers of
these two proteins have been reported to repress NFκBdependent transcription in vivo, most likely by competing
with other transcriptionally active dimers [3]. NFκB is
present in the cytosol in an inactive state, complexed
with the inhibitory IκB protein. In the classical pathway,
NFκB is regulated by two kinases, IKKα and IKKβ.
The latter is particularly important as it phosphorylates
IκB, which is subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded
by the 26S proteasome, thus leading to the activation
of NFκB. Additionally, the IKK complex requires the

well established, identifying a role for NFκB in solid
tumors required the use of mouse models in which tumor
induction depends on inflammation, thus mimicking
inflammation-driven cancers in humans [13]. The first one
was a mouse model for colitis-associated cancer, a type of
colon cancer that appears in patients with ulcerative colitis,
a chronic inflammatory bowel disease [14]. These authors
showed that deletion of IKKβ in intestinal epithelial
cells leads to a dramatic decrease in tumor incidence
without affecting tumor size, which is linked to increased
epithelial apoptosis during tumor promotion. However,
deletion of IKKβ in myeloid cells promoted a decrease
in tumor size, most likely due to a reduced expression of
cytokines that may serve as growth factors for tumor cells.
Another inflammation-linked cancer is hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer.
This cancer mostly develops in the context of chronic
viral hepatitis. An animal model of HCC, associated with
chronic liver inflammation, is the Mdr2 knockout mouse.
This model was used to propose that NFκB constitutes the
link between inflammation and cancer [15]. The authors
monitored hepatitis and cancer progression in knockout
mice, showing that the inflammatory process triggers
hepatocyte NFκB through upregulation of TNFα in
adjacent endothelial and inflammatory cells. Interestingly,
inhibition of NFκB signaling did not affect early phases
of hepatocyte transformation, but inducible inhibition in
later stages of tumor development resulted in apoptosis of
transformed hepatocytes and failure to progress to HCC.
However, another mouse model based on the conditional
deletion of hepatocyte IKKγ exhibited spontaneous liver
damage and developed HCC even without any injection
of a carcinogen [16]. Thus, IKKγ was proposed as a tumor
suppressor in the liver.
Chronic inflammatory disorders such as systemic
lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis have
consistently been associated with the development of
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [17]. NFκB has been
shown to be constitutively activated in these disorders
and it is considered responsible for the maintenance of
chronic inflammation due to cytokines such as TNFα, IL1, IL-6, and IL-8 [18]. Thus, chronic immune stimulation
along with genetic and environmental factors and
some immunosuppressive drugs might be involved in
lymphomagenesis in these patients.
There are many other tumors that rarely arise in the
context of underlying inflammation and yet are dependent
on inflammatory processes, mainly as a consequence of
tumor progression. This may be exemplified by prostate
cancer. Deletion of IKKβ in prostate epithelial cells
proved to have no effect on prostate cancer development or
progression. However, deletion of IKKβ in hematopoieticderived cells slowed down the development of androgenindependent prostate cancer and inhibited the appearance
of metastases [13], most likely due to reduced levels of
NFκB target cytokines that may serve as growth and

genes through targeted knock-ins [4]. Mice lacking
IKKγ or IKKβ die early during embryogenesis with liver
degeneration, a phenotype similar to that of p65-deficient
animals. The analysis of cells lacking individual IKK
subunits led to the identification of two distinct pathways
regulating NFκB activation. IKKβ and IKKγ are essential
for NFκB activation via the canonical pathway, which
is induced by proinflammatory stimuli such as TNFα,
IL-1β and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and leads to the
phosphorylation and degradation of IκB proteins and
the nuclear accumulation of NFκB. IKKα seems to be
dispensable for this process, but it regulates, in a IKKγand IKKβ-independent manner, NFκB activation via the
alternative pathway. This pathway is activated downstream
of receptors controlling lymphoid organogenesis and
lymphocyte development, such as the lymphotoxin-β
receptor and the B cell activating factor (BAFF) receptor,
and induces processing of the NFκB2 (p100) precursor,
resulting in nuclear accumulation of mostly p52/RelB
dimers [5]. IKKβ and IKKα kinases also display a degree
of functional redundancy, exemplified by the presence of
residual proinflammatory signal-induced NFκB activity in
IKKβ-deficient cells.

NFκB IN CANCER
NFκB is one of the major transcription factors
associated with cancer and it has been implicated in many
hallmarks of cancer development, including growth factorindependent proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, limitless
replicative potential and tissue invasion and metastasis [6].
NFκB also seems to play relevant activities in initiating
cells. To this end, it has been shown that inhibition of
this transcription factor maintains pluripotency of mouse
embryonic initiating cells [7], promotes condrogenesis by
human mesenchymal initiating cells [8], and controls the
number of neural progenitor cells [9; 10]. Some cancers
are caused by viruses that encode activators of the NFκB
pathway, which block the cell death inherent in viral
transformation [11]. In a variety of hematologic and solid
tumors, NFκB is constitutively activated by a number of
different mechanisms including mutation of upstream
components of this pathway in tumor cells [12]. This
experimental evidence shows that the NFκB is central
to the pathogenesis of many cancer types, providing
the basis for the development of strategies to block
this pathway. NFκB signaling is activated transiently
when normal B lymphocytes respond to antigens, but
lymphomas accumulate genetic alterations in a number of
NFκB regulators that constitutively activate this pathway.
Similarly, normal plasma cells activate NFκB in response
to ligands, but their malignant counterparts, multiple
myeloma cells, carry a variety of genetic mutations that
stabilize NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK), which leads to
constitutive activation of NFκB. Whereas the involvement
of NFκB activation in hematologic malignancies has been

are of great interest as they provide information about
mechanisms of tumor development and progression, and

provide a mechanistic explanation for some of the main
features that make this tumor so aggressive and resistant
to chemotherapy.

ACTIVATION
OF
NFκB
IN
GLIOBLASTOMA INITIATING CELLS
UNDERGOING DIFFERENTIATION

NFκB IN GLIOBLASTOMA
The association between NFκB and glioblastoma
(GBM) is known for more than 15 years. A number
of authors have described that the NFκB pathway is
constitutively activated or is upregulated in response to
different stimuli, mainly cytokines, in GBM cells. EGFR
gene amplification and overexpression are a particularly
striking feature of GBM, observed in 40-50% of tumors.
In approximately 50% of GBMs with EGFR amplification,
a highly oncogenic EGFR mutant (EGFRvIII) can be
detected. This mutant is generated from a deletion of exons
2 to 7 of the EGFR gene, which results in an in-frame
deletion of 267 amino acids from the extracellular domain
of the receptor. EGFRvIII is unable to bind ligand, and
it signals constitutively. Using GBM cells carrying this
truncated receptor, it has been shown that EGFR induces
association between the docking protein Grb2-associated
binder 1 (Gab1) and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. This
protein complex appears to be critical for linking EGFR
to NFκB transcriptional activity via the PI3-kinase/Akt
signaling axis in GBM cells [19]. In line with this, a recent
work showed that deletion of IκB has an effect similar to
that of EGFR amplification in the pathogenesis of GBM
and is associated with comparatively short survival [20].
In this study, 790 human GBM samples were analyzed for
genetic alterations of IκB and found that this gene is often
deleted but not mutated in GBM and that deletion of IκB
and amplification of EGFR showed a pattern of mutual
exclusivity. This result strengthen the role of the NFκB
signaling pathway in the pathogenesis and/or progression
of GBM. Other works have associated activation of NFκB
with resistance to different cell death strategies such as
TRAIL, a member of the TNF family that selectively
induces apoptosis in certain tumor cells, and O6-alkylating
agents that cause DNA damage, the standard therapy of
GBMs [21; 22]. NFκB activation has also been associated
with worse prognosis in GBM. A recent work showed
that the receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), an upstream
activator of the NFκB pathway, negatively regulates p53
through upregulation of mdm2, a well-known inhibitor of
this tumor suppressor protein, establishing a mechanistic
link between NFκB and p53 [23]. These authors also
showed that RIP1 and mdm2 are commonly overexpressed
in GBM, but not in low grade gliomas, and that increased
expression of RIP1 confers a worse prognosis. A number
of NFκB target genes, including cytokines, cell cycle
regulators, anti-apoptotic proteins and cell adhesion
molecules, have been proposed to influence the invasion
capacity and resistance to chemotherapy of GBM cells.
All these data support the key role of NFκB in GBM and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Very recently, we have demonstrated that activation
of NFκB is upregulated during differentiation of
glioblastoma initiating cells (GICs) [24]. The study
revealed the upregulation of cytokines and chemokines,
including IL-8, IL-11, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-15, and CCL2 and
genes with diverse biological functions, including cell
cycle regulation (Cyclin D1), cell adhesion (CD44) and
proteolysis (TFPI2, PLAU), which are known targets of the
NFκB pathway. This result was consistent with the nuclear
localization of the p65 subunit of NFκB (active state) in
a high proportion of differentiated cells as compared with
the progenitor cell population where more than 90% of the
cells contained p65 within the cytoplasm (inactive state).
The upregulated activity of NFκB in differentiating GICs
was further confirmed by the increase in binding of p50-p65
dimers to a consensus DNA sequence, and a higher level
of phosphorylated IκB. It has been shown that expression
of NFκB significantly increased following differentiation
of embryonic stem (ES) cells with retinoic acid.
Additionally, nuclear localization of NFκB in response
to TNFα, an agonist of NFκB signaling, was evident in
differentiated, but not in undifferentiated ES cells [25].
Similar results have been obtained by other authors [7].
Interestingly, overexpression of NFκB proteins promoted
differentiation, whereas inhibition of NFκB signaling
increased expression of pluripotency markers [7]. We
have observed similar results in a reduced number of GIC
cultures treated with TNFα (Nogueira L and FernandezLuna JL, personal communication). Following treatment
for up to 16h, GIC-containing neurospheres underwent
moderate differentiation as assessed by morphological
features. Furthermore, normal differentiation was retarded
with respect to untreated cells in the presence of a NFκB
signaling inhibitor. The low activation of NFκB detected in
GICs suggests that NFκB may be dispensable for survival
and proliferation of these tumor progenitor cells, which
correlates with data showing that p65 immunoreactivity
is abundant in the cytoplasm of the majority of cells
within neurospheres derived from embryonic mouse
brain, but only occasional weak nuclear localization
(active state) is detected [9]. Our group also showed that
blockade of NFκB in GICs undergoing differentiation
by using genetic strategies or small-molecule inhibitors
accelerates maturation, promotes proliferation arrest
and induces cellular senescence (polyploidy, increase
in pH2AX-containing nuclear foci, induction of β-gal,
telomere shortening) [24]. There are evidences in other
cell systems that suggest the role of NFκB in terminal
648

differentiation. For instance, signaling through the
receptor activator of NFκB (RANK) not only promotes
proliferation but also inhibits the terminal differentiation
of mammary epithelial cells [26]. RANK overexpression
in a transgenic mouse model results in increased
mammary epithelial cell proliferation during pregnancy
and impaired differentiation of lobulo-alveolar structures,
suggesting a role for aberrant RANK signaling during
breast tumorigenesis. NFκB has also been associated with
senescence. In line with this, downregulation of NFκB
has been associated with cellular senescence in a number
of systems. Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma cells
with rapamycine plus 5-fluorouracil led to senescence
accompanied by downregulation of NFκB transcriptional
activity [27]. Additionally, it has been described that Tid1,
a homologue of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene
l(2)tid, contributes to senescence of rat embryo fibroblasts
by acting as a repressor of NFκB signaling [28] and that
replicative cellular senescence of human WI-38 fibroblasts
was accompanied by a strong decrease in nuclear NFκB
[29].
We also showed that knockdown of Cyclin D1,
which is consistently upregulated during differentiation
of GICs, reproduces part of the phenotype observed by
inhibition of the NFκB signaling. In good agreement
with these findings, Cyclin D1 knockdown in neuroblasts
promoted a reduction in cell proliferation and an extensive
neuronal differentiation [30]. We propose that direct
activation of the NFκB pathway may be an efficient
strategy for differentiating glioblastoma-initiating cells
to maintain their proliferative potential, and blockade
of this transcriptional pathway drives tumor cells into
senescence. Further support to this come from c-Neu/
ErbB2-transformed mouse mammary gland cells, cultured
as sphere-forming progenitors, which assume typical

epithelial appearance following a differentiation stimulus,
and grow to some extent, but undergo cellular senescence
following inhibition of NFκB signaling [31].

TARGETING THE NFκB PATHWAY IN
CANCER
Since the identification of the NFκB signaling
pathway, many studies demonstrated the association
between upregulated activity of NFκB and cancer, mostly
by protecting tumor cells from apoptosis. Therefore,
this transcriptional pathway participates in the onset or
progression of many human cancers. It is considered that
the anti-cancer activities of many anti-inflammatory drugs
are, at least in part, related to the inhibition of NFκB.
In addition, many reseacrh groups and companies have
developed novel compounds acting on the NFκB pathway
by using a number of systems, including computational
models to virtually screen chemical databases and
combinatorial biosynthesis. Some of these agents are
supposed to be NFκB specific (i.e. IKK inhibitors)
while others have wide-range biological activities (i.e.
proteasome inhibitors). Given the tight regulation of
NFκB by IκB molecules and the central role of IKKβ
in phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor [32],
IKKβ is a very promising target for therapeutic strategies
aiming at interfering with NFκB activation. To this end,
a number of compounds have been described to inhibit
IKKβ with a wide range of inhibition activities (Table
1). Other widely used inhibitors of the NFκB pathway,
such as Bay 11-7082 and sulfasalazine, have been shown
to inhibit both IKKα and IKKβ [33-35]. Sulfasalazine
is being tested in clinical trials for its use in chronic
inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis.
In addition, a prospective, randomised study of the

safety and efficacy of sulfasalazine for the treatment of
progressing malignant gliomas was initiated in 2005 but
the lack of clinical response and the appearance of side
effects led to its early termination [36]. Many of the IKKβ
inhibitors identified so far are being used in cultured cells
or in animal models and some look promising not only
because of their capacity to control inflammation but also
because of their potential to be used as antitumor drugs
reducing tumor cell survival or inducing sensitisation to
chemotherapy. Among these, PS1145, MLN120B (both
from Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) and
BMS-345541 (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) have
been studied in different tumor models. BMS-345541

sensitises tumor cells derived from mantle cell lymphoma,
multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, melanoma and ovarian
cancer to apoptosis induced by therapeutic agents such as
TRAIL, melphalan, temozolomide or carboplatin [3740]. Sensitisation is produced in most cases by reducing
the expression of NFκB target genes that belong to the
antiapoptotic machinary of the cell (i.e., Bcl-2 and IAP
family members). Similarly, PS-1145 has also been
shown to be effective at promoting sensitisation of cells
from different solid tumors and hematologic malignancies
to apoptosis inducers [41; 42]. A novel glycosylated
indolocarbazol, EC-7014, has been recently identified
as a potent and selective inhibitor of IKKβ [43]. We

have demonstrated that this inhibitor is able to promote
replication arrest and senescence of glioblastoma initiating
cells undergoing differentiation in vitro. Moreover,
intravenous treatment of immunodeficient mice bearing
human GIC-derived tumors with EC-70124 induced
senescence of tumor cells but no ultrastructural alterations
of the brain parenchyma were detected [24]. These findings
support the rationale for therapeutic strategies aimed to
block key factors within the NFκB signaling pathway in
GBM cells. Consistently, it has been recently described
that pharmacological inhibition of NFκB decreased the
viability of GBM cell lines while presented a low toxicity
to normal astrocytes, which indicated selectivity to cancer
cells [44]. In this case, inhibition was achived with
proteasome inhibitors and other compounds that promote
an indirect blockade of NFκB. EC-70124 has been tested
in a panel of 50 human cell lines derived from 8 different
types of solid tumors: breast cancer, prostate cancer, renal
cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, CNS cancer, colon
cancer and lung cancer (Figure 1). The best response
was achieved in melanoma followed by central nervous
system (CNS) cancer cells, mainly glioma cells (mean
LC50 of 3.05 and 4.24 µM respectively) whereas ovarian
cancer cells were the most resistant to the inhibitor.
NFκB activity has been shown to be enhanced in many
cancers, including melanoma, mainly due to deregulations
in upstream signaling pathways such as Ras/Raf, PI3kinase/Akt, and NIK [45]. Proteasome inhibitors, such as
PS-341 (bortezomib, velcade), selectively and reversibly
inhibit the 26S proteasome and prevent the breakdown
of many regulatory proteins through the inhibition of the
ubiquitination-proteasome process. One of these proteins
whose breakdown is impaired is IκB. This presumably
leads to NFκB inactivation and reversal of the malignant
phenotype that it regulates. PS-341 inhibits growth of
melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo either alone or in
combination with temozolomide [46]. This proteasome
inhibitor is already approved for the treatment of patients
with relapsed multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma,
and a number of clinical trials are underway to determine
the value of PS-341 as an effective therapy for malignant
melanoma.
Increasing evidence indicates the need of preclinical
studies and clinical trials using potent and selective
inhibitors of the kinase activity of IKKs to assure the
specificity against a key pathway for a number of cancer
cell types, including glioblastoma. To this end, there
are undergoing clinical trials with novel IKK inhibitors
such as SAR113945, a small molecule inhibitor from
Sanofi-Aventis that is being evaluated in patients with
knee osteoarthritis. This and other compounds that may
pass the safety stage, could be adecuate candidates to be
studied in cancer patients.

AND

Increasing evidence support the key role of the NFκB
signaling pathway in the pathogenesis and/or progression
of GBM. There are many signaling routes that converge
in the activation of NFκB but their relevance in GBM is
poorly understood. Among these pathways, DNA damage
signaling appears to be constitutively activated in gliomas,
as documented by a number of markers, mostly activation
of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. Upon DNA
damage, this protein triggers multiple events to promote
cell survival and facilitate repair. ATM augments cell
survival by activating nuclear factor NFκB. Therefore,
further investigation on the association between ATM
and NFκB in GBM might expand the targeted therapeutic
options to avoid NFκB-dependent tumor cell survival and
thus resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Aditionally, a
detailed study of the vast array of upstream regulators of
NFκB in GBM cells is still to come. NFκB is emerging
as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in GBM.
Although a number of small molecule inhibitors of the
NFκB pathway, mainly inhibitors of IKK proteins, are
already available, more specific inhibitors of IKKβ and
other upstream kinases need to reach clinical studies to
prove their efficacy in GBM patients.
