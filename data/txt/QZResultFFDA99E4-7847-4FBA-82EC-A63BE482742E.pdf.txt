ABSTRACT
Activating mutation of BRAF is a common finding in pediatric gliomas. As many
as 14% of high grade and up to 66% of certain subtypes of low grade pediatric
glioma have the BRAFV600E mutation. Small molecule inhibitors that selectively target
BRAFV600E are FDA approved for melanoma and have shown significant efficacy in
treating BRAFV600E glioma in pre-clinical trials. Despite showing initial anti-tumor
activity, acquired drug resistance significantly limits the benefit from being treated
with BRAFV600E inhibitors. Here, we have identified molecular responses to BRAFV600E
inhibitor treatment in human glioma models that have substantial clinical implications.
Specifically, we show that BRAFV600E inhibitor resistant cells upregulate pro-survival
mediators such as Wnt, and additionally increase receptor tyrosine kinase activity,
including EGFR and Axl, promoting resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition. Our results
suggest strategies to circumvent acquired resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitor therapy,
and thereby improve outcomes for patients with BRAFV600E gliomas.

competitive small molecule inhibitors that are FDAapproved for the treatment of melanoma [7]. We have
previously shown that the tool compound vermurafenib
analogue, PLX4720, reduces tumor growth and prolongs
animal survival in orthotopic xenograft models of
BRAFV600E-mutant glioma [4]. Clinical use of vemurefinib
in treating glioma has produced somewhat mixed results.
Robinson et al reported a case of complete regression in
a pediatric patient treated with vemurafenib for recurrent
BRAFV600E giloblastoma multiforme [7]. Bautista et al
documented partial and transient response to vemurafenib
in two out of three pediatric patients with high grade
BRAFV600E glioma [6]. Chamberlain et al reported
moderate single agent activity of vemurefinib against
recurrent pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which is a
subtype of glioma with an especially high incidence
of BRAFV600E mutation [8]. Combined preclinical and

INTRODUCTION
Oncogenic BRAF mutation occurs in approximately
8% of human cancers [1]. These include as many as 50%
of metastatic melanoma, 70% of papillary thyroid cancer,
30% of ovarian cancer and 20% of colorectal cancers
[1–3]. Over 90% of the BRAF mutations involve a single
amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for valine at
position 600 of BRAF protein, resulting in RAF kinase
activation and constitutive mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAP) signaling [1]. BRAFV600E mutation is found
in as many as 14% of high grade and up to 66% of certain
subtypes of pediatric low grade glioma. Interestingly, this
mutation is much less frequent in adult glioma [4–6].
A number of BRAFV600E selective small molecule
inhibitors have been developed. Vemurafenib (Zelboraf)
and dabrafenib (Tafinlar) are BRAFV600E selective, ATP-

clinical results have led to an ongoing clinical trial testing
the efficacy of vemurafenib or dabrafenib for BRAFV600E
glioma (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01748149 for
vemurafenib and NCT01677741 for dabrafenib).
Results from our preclinical studies using BRAFV600E
inhibitor monotherapy indicate that orthotopic glioma
xenograft growth is delayed and/or slowed down, but not
stopped, when treating mice with PLX4720, suggesting a
tumor adaptive response to BRAFV600E inhibitor therapy
[4, 9]. In fact, acquired resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitors
has been observed in a number of cancer types. In
melanoma, acquired resistance can be mediated through (i)
upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling,
including EGFR, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
(IGF1R) and platelet derived growth factor beta (PDGF-B)
[10–12]; (ii) mutational activation of NRAS and KRAS
[10, 13]; (iii) increasing COT (MAP3K8) kinase activity
[14]; (iv) Raf isoform switching [11, 13]; (v) dimerization
of spliced p61 BRAFV600E [15]; (vi) amplification and
overexpression of BRAFV600E [16]; (vii) enhanced Wnt5A
signaling [17, 18]; (viii) overexpression of Mcl-1 [18]; and
(viiii) increased mitochondrial respiration and oxidative
stress [19]. Interestingly, BRAF inhibitor insensitive
melanoma regains its sensitivity after a temporary
withdrawal of drug [12, 20].
We have previously shown that feedback activation
of EGFR is one way in which BRAFV600E glioma respond
and escape from BRAFV600E glioma inhibitor treatment [9].
In the present study, we show that BRAFV600E inhibitor
treatment additionally elevates Axl RTK activity, and
also increases Wnt signaling. These tumor responses
motivated our investigation of the effects from genetic as
well as pharmacologic inhibition of Axl and EGFR, either
concurrent with the PLX4720 tool compound treatment
or subsequent to BRAFV600E glioma adaptation to tool
compound treatment. In each context, EGFR and Axl
inhibition promoted increased tumor cell death, as well as
inhibited tumor cell growth. These results support specific
combination therapies for increasing BRAFV600E glioma
patient benefit from treatment with BRAFV600E inhibitor.

corresponding RGCs (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure
S1B). RGCs were also less responsive to PLX4720
induced MAPK pathway inhibition than corresponding
TNPCs, as indicated by a lesser inhibitor effect on RGC
pMEK and pERK status upon PLX4720 treatment (Figure
1C; Supplementary Figure S1C).
Because increased CRAF and IGF1R activity have
each been implicated in melanoma BRAFV600E inhibitor
resistance [11, 21], we examined RGC vs. corresponding
TNPC for phospho- CRAF and IGF1R levels by
immunoblotting. No appreciable differences in phosphoand total CRAF and IGF1R signals were evident upon
inspection of corresponding cell pair results (Figure 1C;
Supplementary Figure S1C). Nevertheless, we observed
dose dependent reduction of phospho- CRAF upon
PLX4720 treatment (Figure 1C).

PLX4720 resistant glioma cells show elevated
RTK and Ras activities
Elevated Ras activity has been observed in
association with BRAFV600E inhibitor resistance in
melanoma [10]. Our comparison of Ras activity in TNPC
vs. RGC, using GST Raf1 Ras pulldown assay, revealed
increased Ras activity in RGC, irrespective of the presence
or absence of PLX4720 in cell culture medium (Figure
1D). Interestingly, we found that PLX4720 withdrawal for
48 hours resensitized RGC to PLX4720, as indicated by
pMEK analysis (Supplementary Figure S2). This finding
suggests that acquired resistance to the inhibitor was
maintained only as long as inhibitor treatments persisted,
and that intermitted BRAFV600E inhibition might be an
approach to overcome drug resistance. In agreement with
our previous report, TNPCs treated with PLX4720 showed
increased Ras activity compared to DMSO treated control
cells, most likely due to feedback activation of upstream
RTK upon MAPK pathway inhibition [9] (Figure 1D).
We then investigated if elevated Ras activity in
RGC was due to upregulation of RTK signaling by
comparing RTK phosphorylation levels in RGC vs. TNPC
using human phospho- RTK arrays. The results from this
analysis show increased phospho Axl, EGFR and RYK in
RGC (Figure 1E). Elevated Axl and EGFR activities in
RGC were confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure 2A and
4A). Examination of an array of human glioma cell lines
showed substantial EGFR and Axl expression in GBM
cells (Supplementary Figure S3).

RESULTS
Development & characterization of PLX4720resistant BRAFV600E glioma cells
To study the mechanisms of acquired resistance,
we established two human PLX4720 resistant glioma cell
lines (RGCs) by culturing parental AM-38 and DBTRG05MG cells in the presence of increasing inhibitor
concentrations. RGCs that had adapted to 5 uM inhibitor
showed a reduced G1 phase cell cycle population,
relative to corresponding treatment naïve parental cells
(TNPCs) upon initial exposure to PLX4720 (Figure
1A, Supplementary Figure S1A), and TNPC viability
was more substantially impaired by PLX4720 than for

Elevated Axl expression and activity are
important for RGC viability
To determine the importance of Axl in conferring
PLX4720 resistance property, we used genetic and
pharmacological approaches to reduce Axl activity in
RCG. Axl siRNA knock down and Axl inhibitors (R428
and foretinib) significantly reduced RGC cell viability

S4) and colony formation assays (Figure 2C), suggesting
that Axl signaling promotes the viability of PLX4720
resistant glioma cells. The viability loss conferred by Axl
knock down or inhibition was profound, and additional
PLX4720 exposure did not further compromise cell
viability (Supplementary Figure S4).

S5B). HKI-272 treatment serves as negative control for
EGFR activity.

Wnt signaling is elevated in PLX4720 resistant
glioma cells
We next investigated transcriptome differences
between TNPCs and corresponding RGCs by gene
expression arrays. Among the genes that are most
differentially expressed between RGCs and TNPCs
(p> 0.05), we found many involved with Wnt pathway
signaling, with higher expression consistently associated
with RGC (Table 1).
We compared Wnt pathway transcriptional activity
in corresponding TNPC-RGC cell pairs using a Cignal
TCF/LEF reporter assay. RGC showed an almost twofold higher level of Wnt pathway activity associated
transcription compared to TNPC maintained in PLX4720
free media (Figure 6A). However, TNPC treated with
PLX4720 for 24 hours showed a significant increase in
Wnt signaling compared to DMSO treated control TNPC
cells, indicating Wnt pathway activation occurs in just a
short period of time following introduction of BRAFV600E
inhibitor to previously untreated cells.

Exogenous Axl expression increases TNPC
resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitor
To investigate if Axl activity confers PLX4720
resistance, we expressed exogenous wild-type and kinasedead K567R Axl in TNPC, then examined the response to
PLX4720 treatment. TNPCs expressing exogenous wildtype Axl showed significantly higher levels of phosphoAxl compared to vector or kinase dead K567R Axl
transfected TNPC (Figure 3A). Upon treatment with 5 uM
PLX4720, wild-type Axl overexpressing TNPC showed
significantly higher numbers of viable cells (> 80% viable
cells), relative to TNPC transfected with vector (~ 70%
viable cells) or kinase dead K567R Axl (~ 60% viable
cells) (Figure 3B; Supplementary Figure S5A).

Elevated EGFR expression and activity are
important for RGC viability

Canonical Wnt pathway inhibition does not
affect RGC viability

To study the importance of EGFR to RGC PLX4720
resistance, we used EGFR siRNA and small molecule
inhibition (HKI-272) to reduce EGFR activity in RGCs
(Figure 4; Supplementary Figure S5) then examined
RGC response to PLX4720. HKI-272 is an EGFR and
HER2 inhibitor that demonstrated anti-tumor activity
in glioma models [9]. Both genetic and pharmacologic
inhibition of EGFR activity significantly reduced RGC
proliferation (Figure 4B; Supplementary Figure S6) and
colony formation (Figure 4C). Additionally, PLX4720
increased the efficacy of EGFR knockdown in TNGC cells
but not RGCs (Supplementary Figure S6), likely due to
upregulation of EGFR signaling in RGCs and therefore
EGFR knockdown per se is more effective in reducing
RGC cell viability than PLX4720, as RGC cells have
bypassed PLX4720 through upstream RTK activation [9].

Canonical Wnt signaling is mediated by betacatenin, which is a transcription factor that activates Wnt
responsive genes. To investigate if canonical Wnt pathway
inhibition affects PLX4720 resistant glioma cell viability,
we suppressed Wnt signaling by treating RGC with Wnt
inhibitor FH535, and also by knocking down RCG betacatenin via siRNA transfection (Supplementary Figure
S7). 10 uM FH535 treatment did not affect RGC viability
as determined by WST-1 and colony formation assays
(Figure 6B and 6C). Similarly, no significant change in
viability was observed in control vs beta-catenin knocked
down RGCs (Figure 6D).

Inhibition of Axl and EGFR, but not Wnt,
significantly impairs RGC viability
We next examined combined pharmacologic
inhibition by incubating RGCs and TNPCs with HKI-272
or foretinib or FH535, both in the presence and absence
of PLX4720. HKI-272 and foretinib treatments resulted
in a significant reduction in RGC and TNPC viability in
both AM38 and DBTRG-05MG cells (Supplementary
Figure S8, Supplementary Figure S9), however the
inclusion of PLX4720 with such treatments showed little
additional inhibitory effect. In contrast, we observed cell
line dependent effect of FH535. FH535 treatment alone
showed no significant impact TNPC cell number, whereas
the combination of PLX4720 and FH535 resulted in

Exogenous EGFR expression increases TNPC
resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitor
To determine the importance of increased EGFR
activity to BRAFV600E cell response to PLX4720, we
expressed exogenous EGFR in TNPC (Figure 5).
Significantly less PLX4720 effect was observed for
TNPC expressing exogenous wild-type EGFR (~ 10%
viability loss relative to vehicle-treated control cells), in
comparison to mock transfected cells (~ 40% viability loss
relative to control cells) (Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure

the first evidence showing that Axl inhibition suppresses
BRAFV600E glioma, and that Axl inhibition is a therapeutic
strategy deserving of further development for clinical
translation.
In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells Axl
has been shown to dimerize with EGFR and promote
ligand independent phosphorylation of EGFR, leading
to increased activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLC γ)
and protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ), as well as mTOR [28].
Zang et al have shown that genetic and pharmacologic
inhibition of Axl help prevent acquired resistance to
EGFR inhibition, in EGFR–mutant lung cancer models
[29]. In breast cancer, activated EGFR has been shown to
transactivate Axl. These observations, combined with new
results reported in the present study, suggest a coordinated
Axl + EGFR tumor cell response in adapting to various
small molecule inhibitor therapies.
We also observed increased expression of multiple
Wnt pathway genes, including Wnt5A, FZD2, Dvl3 and
WSP1, in RGCs, with elevated Wnt pathway-associated
transcription in these cells confirmed by TCF/LEF
reporter results. However, in contrast to previous report
with U251 (BRAF wild-type) glioma cells [30], genetic
and pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling did not
affect BRAFV600E glioma cell growth and did not sensitize
RGCs to BRAFV600E inhibition. Wnt 5A is an important
component of the non-canonical Wnt signaling effects,
which include cytoskeleton organization and function
[31], potentially through frizzled receptor interaction
with RYK, the expression of which we also found to be
increased in RGCs (Figure 1E). Future work is required
for detailed investigation of non-canonical Wnt signaling
effects, and of relationships with tumor phenotypes other
than cell viability.
Irrespective of the nature of Wnt pathway
involvement with BRAFV600E glioma cell adaptation to
BRAFV600E inhibitor treatment, our current work provides
information important to improving the duration and/or
extent of BRAFV600E glioma therapy by interfering with
compensatory cell responses that involve increasing Axl
and EGFR activities. Given the availability of clinically
approved compounds for inhibiting these RTKs, there will
certainly be opportunities for translating our observations
to evaluate combination therapies for treating patients with
BRAFV600E glioma.

DISCUSSION
Vemurafenib has shown promising results in
preclinical and clinical studies of BRAFV600E-mutant
glioma [4, 22]. However, as observed with other
cancer types, such as melanoma, acquired resistance to
vemurafinib significantly limits the benefit from sustained
BRAFV600E inhibitor treatment. We have previously shown
in a BRAFV600E glioma model that BRAF monotherapy
is inefficient in suppressing tumor growth, whereas
combination with EGFR inhibitor confers significant antitumor efficacy, suggesting that both BRAF oncogene as
well as primary resistance mechanisms have to be inhibited
in vivo to prevent acute resistance from developing [9].
Here we provide new information regarding the molecular
basis of BRAFV600E glioma adaptation and acquired
resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition. Our results indicate an
important role of Axl and EGFR signaling in conferring
vemurafenib resistance in BRAFV600E glioma.
We have previously shown that EGFR is
hyperactivated upon BRAFV600E inhibitor treatment,
likely a consequence of reduced expression of the EGFR
phosphatase PTPN9 upon MAPK pathway inhibition
[9], and that combination EGFR and BRAF inhibition
significantly improves anti-tumor efficacy in an in vivo
model of BRAFV600E glioma. Here, we show that Axl
expression and activity are also increased in RGCs. Axl
activity has been shown to contribute to tumor malignant
phenotypes, including cell migration, survival and
chemosensitivity [23–25]. As with EGFR, the increased
activity of Axl is therapeutically actionable. Axl inhibitors
foretinib and R428 (BGB324) have been shown by others
to inhibit glioma cell proliferation, migration, collagen
invasion and survival in vitro [26, 28]. Treatment of
rodents bearing subcutaneous U251 glioma xenografts
with foretinib has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and
prolonged animal survival [26]. Similar results were seen
in animals bearing glioma cells modified with a dominantnegative Axl expression construct [27]. Importantly,
the previous studies of Axl in glioma used tumor cell
sources expressing wild-type BRAF. Here we provide

at 10 mM and stored at -20°C. The final DMSO
concentration in all experiment was less than 0.1% in
medium.

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded onto 48-well plates at 2500
to 3000 cells per well. After 16 hours of seeding, cells

Cell culture and transfection

Cell cycle analysis

All cell lines were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1%
penicillin and streptomycin, and 1% non-essential
amino acid. PLX4720 resistant cells were generated by
culturing parental AM38 and DBTRG-05MG cells in
increasing concentrations of PLX4720 to achieve chronic
selection. PLX4720 resistant cells were maintained in
the presence of 5 uM PLX4720. For Axl, EGFR and
B-catenin siRNA knock down experiments, cells were
transfected with Dharmacon siGENOME non-target
siRNA, Axl SMARTpool siRNA or EGFR SMARTpool
siRNA following manufacturers instruction (Thermo
Scientific, MA, USA). For Axl and EGFR overexpression,
transfection was achieved using the Amaza Basic Glial
Cells Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, Germany) following
manufacturers instructions.

Cells were treated with or without drugs for 24 hours
before harvesting. The trypsinized cells were washed with
PBS and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight followed
by staining with propidium iodide (20 ug/ml) (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California, USA) in PBS containing RNaseA
(0.4 mg/ml) (Invitrogen). Fluorescence levels (488nm

fluorescent images produced during Affymetrix GeneChip
hybridizations were read using the Affymetrix Model 3000
Scanner and converted into GeneChip probe results files
(CEL) using Command and Expression Console software
(Affymetrix). The analysis of the microarray data was
done by first normalizing for array-specific effects by

Western blotting
Proteins were extracted from cells using cell
lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
Massachusetts, USA) supplemented with proteinase
(Roche, Upper Bavaria, Germany) and phosSTOP
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Proteins
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then

Affymetrix's “Robust Multi-Array” (RMA) normalization.
The normalized arrays values were then reported on a log2
scale. For statistical analyses, all array probesets where no
experimental groups had an average log2 intensity greater
than 3.0 were removed. This is a standard cutoff as below
which expression is indistinguishable from background
noise. Linear models were then fitted for each gene using
the Bioconductor limma package in R [33]. Moderated
t-statistics, fold-change and the associated p-values were
calculated for each gene. The experiments were performed
in triplicates.
