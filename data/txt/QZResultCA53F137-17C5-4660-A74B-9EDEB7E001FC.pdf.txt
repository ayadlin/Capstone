Abstract
Overexpression of ERBB2 and its neighboring genes on chromosome 17 occurs in approximately 25% of breast
tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. While amplification of the 17q12-21 chromosomal region often
correlates with an increase in the transcriptional rates of the locus, the molecular mechanisms and the factors
involved in the coordinated expression of genes residing within the ERBB2 amplicon remain largely unknown.
Here we demonstrate that estrogen-related receptor a (ERRa, NR3B1) and its coregulator PGC-1b are key
effectors in this process. Using a mouse model of ERBB2-initiated mammary tumorigenesis, we first show that
ablation of ERRa significantly delays ERBB2-induced tumor development and lowers the levels of amplicon
transcripts. Chromosome 17q-wide binding site location analyses in human breast cancer cells show preferential
recruitment of ERRa to DNA segments associated with the ERBB2 amplicon. Furthermore, ERRa directs the corecruitment of the coactivator PGC-1b to segments in the 17q12 region and the recruitment of RNA polymerase
II to the promoters of the ERBB2 and coamplified genes. ERRa and PGC-1b also participate in the de-repression
of ERBB2 expression through competitive genomic cross-talk with estrogen receptor a (ERa) and, as a
consequence, influence tamoxifen sensitivity in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that
ERRa and PGC-1b are key players in the etiology of malignant breast cancer by coordinating the transcriptional
regulation of genes located in the 17q12 region, a process that also involves interference with the repressive
function of ERa on ERBB2 expression. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10277–87. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a complex disease implicating distinct cell
types and multiple signaling pathways that together engender
a multiplicity of tumor subtypes (1). The molecular heterogeneity of breast tumor subtypes dictates their intrinsic
response to specific therapeutic approaches and has therefore
become an important aspect in the clinical management of the
disease (2). Amplification of the 17q12–21 region leads to
concomitant overexpression of ERBB2 and several coamplified
genes and occurs in approximately 20% to 30% of breast tumors
(3). The ERBB2-amplified breast cancer subtype is strongly
associated with poor prognosis (4). Although overexpression of
ERBB2 is usually linked to amplification of the 17q12 region,
this region is not amplified in some ERBB2-positive breast

tumors. However, in both instances, an increase in the transcriptional regulation rate of the locus is observed (5–8).
Loss of repression of ERBB2 has been linked to tamoxifen
resistance in breast cancer cells (9, 10). It is believed that
transcriptional repressors including FOXP3 (11), PAX2 (10),
GATA4 (12), PEA3 (13), and MYB (14) act to quench the
expression of ERBB2 in ERBB2-negative tumors. Notably, it
has also been shown that estrogen receptor a (ERa, NR3A1),
in cooperation with the transcription factor PAX2, can repress
ERBB2 expression through binding to a cis-regulatory element
in the presence of either 17b-estradiol (E2) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT; ref. 10). Indeed, ERa-positive tumors with
the worst prognosis that do not respond to tamoxifen therapy
often express high levels of ERBB2 (15–18).
A positive increase in the transcriptional control of the
locus can contribute to relieve the transcriptional repression
that takes place on ERBB2, and overexpression of ERBB2 is
thought to drive the amplification of the 17q12 locus (19).
Transcription factors such as AP-2 (8), YY1 (20), ETS (21), YB-1
(22), and EGR2 (23) have been shown to be recruited to the
promoter of ERBB2 and play a role in its overexpression in
breast cancer cells. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms
governing the repressive and positive regulation of ERBB2
expression and its neighboring genes in the amplified locus is
of considerable importance in identifying the transcription
factors and molecular events involved in the establishment of
ERBB2-positive tumors.

Although most studies on the 17q12 amplicon have been
centered on the expression and activity of ERBB2 itself, it is
now clear that coamplified genes not only contribute but
could also be essential to the progression of ERBB2-positive
breast tumors (24, 25). The minimal 17q12 amplicon includes
genes that are involved in signal transduction (GRB7, PERLD1,
PPP1R1B), transcription (MED1, IKZF3, NEUROD2, PNMT), cell
migration and invasion (C17orf37, GRB7), inhibition of apoptosis (MED1), genomic instability (PERLD1), and tamoxifen
resistance (STARD3, GRB7; refs. 26–28). Although transcriptional regulation of the coamplified genes in relation to the
ERBB2 subtype is now considered an important aspect in the
establishment of ERBB2-positive breast tumors, the molecular
mechanisms associated with this phenomenon have yet to be
investigated in detail.
The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor a
(ERRa, NR3B1) shares both structural and functional features
with ERa (29). The expression of ERRa is inversely correlated
to that of ERa but positively associates with that of ERBB2 and
with poor prognosis in breast cancer (30, 31). A recent
genome-wide binding sites location analysis in breast cancer
cell lines intersected with gene expression data from breast
tumors has shown that ERRa signaling contributes to known
pathways linked to breast cancer progression, including those
involving ERa and ERBB2 (32). Conversely, the transcriptional
activity of ERRa can be modulated by the epidermal growth
factor (EGF)/ERBB2 signaling pathway in breast tumors (33,
34). ERRa preferentially acts in concert with the coregulators
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g, coactivator-1a
(PGC-1a), and PGC-1b, whose combined roles have been
extensively studied in the context of the regulation of bioenergetic pathways (35, 36). Gene expression and binding
sites location analyses in breast cancer cell lines have also
demonstrated that ERa and ERRa display strict binding site
specificity and maintain independent mechanisms of transcriptional activation, suggesting a prevailing ERa-independent role for ERRa in breast tumor development (32, 37).
Nevertheless, a significant number of genes that are common
targets of the 2 nuclear receptors are also important players in
breast tumor development (32).
Here we show that ERRa is required for the full potential of
ERBB2-driven mammary tumorigenesis in mice and that
tumors lacking ERRa express lower levels of most amplicon
genes. Chromosome-wide identification of regulatory regions
occupied by ERRa and PGC-1b as well as gene expression data
identify both factors as key regulators of the expression of
ERBB2 and several coamplified genes in the 17q12 region in
breast cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrate that an antagonistic interaction between ERa and the ERRa/PGC-1b complex at the ERBB2 locus is an important determinant of ERBB2
expression involved in the development of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, reagents, and antibodies
MCF-7 and SKBr3 cells were cultured as described previously
(38). Tam-R-MCF-7 cell line was derived as described previously

10278

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

(39). ERRa chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were
performed using an anti-hERRa polyclonal antibody raised and
validated in our laboratory (32, 40). Other antibodies used were
anti-RNA-Polymerase II (8WG16), anti-ERRa (Millipore), antiPGC-1b, and anti-ERa (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). siRNAs
against ERa, ERRa, PGC-1b, and control (ON-Target-Plus siRNA
pool) were obtained from Dharmacon.
Transgenic mouse model study
The derivation of the conditionally activated NeuNT
(erbB2NT) has been described in detail (41). To generate mice
that expressed erbB2NT in the mammary glands of animals
carrying a null allele for Esrra, erbB2NT and MMTV-Cre mice
were first bred with mice heterozygous for null alleles of Esrra
(42). All mice were previously derived in a pure FVB genetic
background. These mice were then bred to generate mice null
for Esrra also carrying one copy of erbB2NT and one copy of
MMTV-Cre (e.g., Ersra//erbB2NT/MMTV-Cre). The resulting
mice were examined for the presence of the excised recombinant erbB2NT allele through Southern blot analysis. The levels
of amplification of the locus were determined by quantitative
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using primers listed in Supplementary
Table S1. Female mice were examined twice a week for
mammary tumor development by palpation.
ChIP assays and ChIP-on-chip on chr.17q tiled arrays
ChIP was performed as described previously (38). Quantification of ChIP enrichment by real-time qRT-PCR was carried
out using the LightCycler480 instrument (Roche). ChIP-onchip was carried out on custom chr.17q Agilent tiled arrays
(150-bp resolution). Chromatin was prepared from SKBr3 cells
(for ERRa and PGC-1b ChIP-on-chip) or from MCF-7 cells
exposed to 10 nmol/L E2 for 45 minutes (for ERa ChIP-onchip). The primers used for standard ChIP are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Computational motif discovery
De novo and known motif discovery was performed with
MEME Suite (http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme4_4_0/intro.html).
Motif discovery was also confirmed using the Genomatix
Software Suite (http://www.genomatix.de/en/produkte/
genomatix-software-suite.html).
siRNA
siRNA for ERa and control were transfected in MCF-7 cells
cultured in phenol-red-free DMEM media supplemented with
hormone-deprived serum using the HyperFect reagent
(Qiagen). Similarly, siRNAs for ERRa, PGC-1b, and control
were transfected in SKBr3 cells using the HyperFect reagent
for 48 to 60 hours.
Expression analysis
mRNA from SKBr3 cells transfected with the ERRa or PGC1b siRNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript (Invitrogen) and analyzed by qRT-PCR with SYBRgreen–based RT-PCR (Roche). Alternatively, RNA was
extracted from mice mammary gland tumors using the
RNA tissue extraction kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed

using Superscript (Invitrogen). Primer pairs used for qRT-PCR
are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
Proliferation assay assessed by 3H-thymidine
incorporation
SKBr3 cells were transfected with the appropriate siRNA for
60 hours. Cells were incubated in the presence of 1 mCi 3Hthymidine for 4 hours prior to fixation and harvesting. Similarly, MCF-7 and Tam-R-MCF-7 cells were grown in phenol–
red-free DMEM supplemented with hormone-deprived serum.
Upon siRNA transfection, the media was supplemented with
100 nmol/L OHT (Sigma) or vehicle for 60 hours before
harvesting and isotope counting.

Results
Ablation of ERRa delays ERBB2-induced mammary
gland tumorigenesis
To initiate our study on the functional relationship between
ERRa and ERBB2 in mammary gland tumorigenesis, we first
used the well-characterized Neu-NT knock-in transgenic mouse
model of mammary tumorigenesis (41) to generate ERRadeficient transgenic mice conditionally expressing the activated
Neu under the control of the endogenous Erbb2 promoter. The
choice of this model was guided by the previous observation that
these mice develop focal mammary tumors with high frequency
after a long latency period that bear amplified copies of the
activated Erbb2 allele on chromosome 11 (41, 43). In addition,
this model is ideal to study the impact of alteration in the gene
regulatory machinery as expression of the Erbb2 locus remains
under the control of endogenous regulatory elements. We
observed that ablation of ERRa significantly delayed ERBB2induced mammary gland tumorigenesis (P < 0.05; Fig. 1A),
indicating that the presence of ERRa is required for optimal
development of ERBB2-driven tumors. The ERRa-null mice
lactate normally and the development of the mammary gland
is not affected by the lack of ERRa expression (Fig. 1B). As
expected, amplification of the Erbb2 locus was observed in
the tumors derived from this model but the absence of ERRa
did not significantly affect the level of amplification of the
locus as compared with wild-type (Fig. 1C). To investigate the
possible contribution of ERRa in the transcriptional regulation of Erbb2 and neighboring genes in the Erbb2 amplicon,
we next assessed their levels of expression in the tumors. We
found that the relative transcript levels of most of the
amplicon genes tested, including Erbb2, were either significantly decreased or show a similar downward trend in tumors
arising from ERRa knockout mice compared with the wildtype ones (Fig. 1D). Overall, these results suggest that ERRa
might play a role in the development of ERBB2-driven mammary tumors through transcriptional regulation of Erbb2 and
other genes located within the amplicon.
ERRa is recruited to specific sites at chr.17q12 and
regulates the expression of ERBB2 and coamplified
genes in human breast cancer cells
In order to investigate the role of ERRa in the transcriptional regulation of the genes located within the ERBB2

amplicon in human breast cancer cells, we first performed
genomic location analysis of ERRa in the ERa-negative SKBr3
cell line using a custom tiled array covering the q-arm of
human chromosome 17. ChIP-on-chip analysis of ERRa on the
chr.17q region revealed 92 segments bound by ERRa and
validated by standard ChIP analyses (Supplementary Table S3
and Fig. S1A). De novo DNA motif discovery confirmed the
enrichment of the ERRE motif within the bound segments
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Remarkably, a significant enrichment of ERRa-bound segments is observed within the amplicon region (32 out of 92 segments) and 13 segments map to
the minimal region steadily amplified in ERBB2-positive
tumors (Fig. 2A, shaded region). ERRa binding events were
observed in ERBB2 itself as well as in the transcriptional unit
of genes that are consistently coamplified with ERBB2, such as
PERLD1, C17orf37, and GRB7 (Fig. 2B).
To relate the binding profile of ERRa to the transcriptional
regulation of target genes, we then monitored modulation in
the recruitment of RNA-PolII by ChIP to the promoters of
genes located within the ERBB2 amplicon upon depletion of
ERRa in SKBr3 cells. Indeed, a significant decrease in both
ERRa and RNA-PolII recruitment was observed at the promoter of CRKRS, a target gene at which ERRa binding occurs
directly at the promoter (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, a decrease in
RNA-PolII recruitment was also observed at promoters of
amplicon genes for which ERRa binding takes place far
upstream of the transcriptional start sites or in intronic
regions of genes such as ERBB2, GRB7, and PERLD1
(Fig. 3A). Depletion of ERRa had no effect on the occupancy
of RNA-PolII at the promoter of the gene, LZTS2, that is not a
target of ERRa (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that the
recruitment of ERRa at both near and distant sites from
transcriptional start sites contributes to the recruitment of
RNA-PolII at the promoters of target genes. We next assessed
the effect of ERRa depletion on the expression of amplicon
genes in human breast cancer cells. In agreement with the
observation made in ERBB2-induced tumors developed in the
ERRa knockout mice, depletion of ERRa in SKBr3 cells leads
to a significant decrease in the relative expression of most
amplicon genes (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that ERRa
positively regulates the expression of ERBB2 and numerous
genes that coamplify with it on chr.17q12.
The coactivator PGC-1b is recruited to ERRa-bound
segments in the chr.17q12 amplicon
We have previously shown that the coactivator PGC-1b can
be corecruited with ERRa at specific genomic locations in
SKBr3 cells (32). To assess whether PGC-1b contributes more
broadly in the transcriptional regulation of amplicon genes,
we performed PGC-1b ChIP-on-chip in SKBr3 cells hybridized
on the chr.17q tiled array. The ChIP-on-chip experiment
identified 73 segments significantly bound by PGC-1b on
chr.17q (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary
Fig. S2A) of which 24 were segments common to ERRa
(Fig. 4A). Interestingly, PGC-1b recruitment was observed at
sites shared with ERRa in regions located within key genes of
the ERBB2 amplicon including ERBB2, PERLD1, GRB7, and
NR1D1 (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary

Fig. S2B). De novo DNA motif discovery identified the ERRE as
the most enriched motif within the common segments shared
by both factors (P ¼ 7.8e-05), indicating that PGC-1b recruitment to the common segments occurs through ERRa (Fig. 4A
and Supplementary Fig. S3). Indeed, depletion of ERRa in
SKBr3 cells using specific siRNAs leads to a significant reduction in PGC-1b recruitment to the common sites located in
chr.17q amplicon genes as assessed by standard ChIP (Fig. 4B).
We further tested the effect of PGC-1b recruitment on the
expression of the amplicon transcripts. As observed for ERRa,
depletion of PGC-1b using specific siRNAs leads to a significant

10280

decrease in the relative levels of transcripts of several amplicon
genes (Fig. 4C). Because ERBB2 and the coamplified genes are
potent inducers of breast tumor growth, we next evaluated the
impact of loss of ERRa and/or PGC-1b on cell proliferation.
Specific knockdown of ERRa, PGC-1b, or of both factors, using
specific siRNAs led to a significant decrease in SKBr3 cell
proliferation as assayed by 3H-thymidine incorporation
(Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that ERRa
contributes to the corecruitment of PGC-1b to the chr.17q
region and that both factors regulate the expression of amplicon genes and aggressive growth of SKBr3 breast cancer cells.

ERRa competes with ERa for recruitment to common
segments in ERBB2 and GRB7 and contributes, along
with PGC-1b, to tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7 cells
In ER-positive tumors that are tamoxifen-sensitive, the
expression of ERBB2 is low due to transcriptional repression of
the gene inflicted by various transcription factors, including
ERa and the corepressor PAX2. It has been suggested that loss
of this repression and consequential increase in ERBB2 expres-

sion and signaling contribute to acquired tamoxifen resistance
(10). Overexpression of other coamplified genes such as GRB7
have also been implicated in resistance to endocrine therapy.
We next explored the possibility that ERRa could interfere
with ERa signaling in the regulation of specific genes within
the ERBB2 amplicon and thus take part in the development of
tamoxifen resistance. In order to assess a potential cross-talk
at the genomic level, we performed an ERa ChIP-on-chip

tamoxifen sensitivity of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5A).
We confirmed that treatment of MCF-7 cells with E2 leads
to a downregulation of ERBB2 and GRB7 expression (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Examination of the bound sequences in
ERBB2 and GRB7 revealed the presence of a mixed ERE/ERRE
binding site as previously defined for shared ERa/ERRa
binding sites (32), indicating that ERa and ERRa should
compete for binding at these common sites. Using specific
siRNAs and standard ChIP, we indeed observed that depletion
of ERa from MCF-7 cells was accompanied by an increase in
ERRa recruitment to the common sites that were otherwise
not bound by ERRa in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5B). Depletion of ERa
had no effect on ERRa recruitment to ERRa-specific sites
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). These results indicate that the
concomitant presence of both nuclear receptors yields to

We next asked whether this transcriptional cross-talk could
play a role in endocrine resistance using a tamoxifen-resistant
MCF-7 cell line generated in our laboratory (Tam-R-MCF-7).
As expected, the expression of ERBB2 and GRB7 is increased in
the Tam-R-MCF-7 cell line compared with the parental MCF-7
cells (Fig. 5C). We further show that depletion of either ERRa
or PGC-1b (Supplementary Fig. S5C and D) leads to a significant decrease in ERBB2 and GRB7 transcripts in Tam-RMCF-7 cells while having no effect on the expression of these
genes in the parental MCF-7 cell line (Fig. 5C). We then
assessed the effect of loss of ERRa or PGC-1b on the proliferation of parental MCF-7 and Tam-R-MCF-7 cells in the
absence or presence of OHT. As shown in Figure 5D, the
proliferation rate of MCF-7 cells is decreased upon OHT

ERRa Regulation of the ERBB2 Amplicon

Discussion
Amplification of the ERBB2 locus and neighboring loci on
chromosome 17q12, which is accompanied by overexpression
of the amplified genes, plays an important role in the development of tamoxifen resistance and a more aggressive breast
cancer phenotype (44). The outcome of this work, derived
from a functional genomic approach and validated in wellcharacterized in vivo and in vitro models of human breast
cancer, demonstrates that the orphan nuclear receptor ERRa
and its coregulator PGC-1b are key elements in the transcriptional regulation of genes located within the chr.17q amplicon,
including ERBB2 itself. In addition, this study identifies molecular mechanisms through which these 2 factors can contribute to the development of tamoxifen resistance in breast
cancer cells.
The observation that ERRa regulates the expression of
several genes located within the ERBB2 amplicon denotes
the importance of ERRa signaling in the progression of the
ERBB2-driven breast tumor subtype. This is further emphasized by the observation that the presence of ERRa is required
to observe the full oncogenic potential of ERBB2 in a wellestablished mouse model of human breast cancer (Fig. 1).
Notably, we have shown that ERRa regulates the expression of
most genes present in the minimal ERBB2 amplicon. The
coamplified genes are mainly involved in signal transduction
and transcription influencing various biological processes
including cell migration, invasion, and survival as well as
resistance to tamoxifen (9, 10, 24–28). It can therefore be
envisioned that, by acting as a global transcriptional regulator
of the ERBB2 amplicon, ERRa contributes to establish the
ERBB2-positive tumor subtype which is characterized not only
by increased ERRB2 signaling but also by various cellular
processes controlled by coamplified genes. Mechanisms that
trigger the amplification of the locus are not well understood
but it has been observed that an increase in the transcription
levels of ERBB2 often precedes locus amplification (5, 45).
ERRa could inflict positive transcriptional pressure on the
17q12 region and thus participates actively in the establishment of ERBB2-positive aggressive tumors.
Our results are in agreement with previous observations
demonstrating that expression of ERRa positively correlates
with that of ERBB2 in breast tumors and that ERRa transcriptional activity is positively modulated by EGFR/ERBB2
signaling in breast cancer cells (30, 33, 34). Such interactions
can be integrated in a model of positive feed-forward regulatory loops whereby all the processes involved further
enhance the buildup of their own stimulus (46). In ERBB2negative tumors, the expression of ERBB2 is maintained at low
levels by various sequence-specific transcription factors such
as Pax2, FOXP3, PEA3, GATA4, and MYB, as well as by ERa. It
is thus likely that the positive feed-forward regulatory loop
involving ERRa and PGC-1b favors escape from the negative
regulation inflicted on ERBB2 by ERa during progression of
breast cancer (Fig. 6). This model suggests a possible role for
ERRa in mediating the transition of a subset of ER-positive
luminal tumors toward the more aggressive ERBB2-expressing
subtype.

Figure 6. ERRa and PGC-1b are involved in a positive feed-forward
regulatory loop with ERBB2. In ER-positive/tamoxifen sensitive
tumors, ERBB2 expression is maintained at low levels by transcriptional
repressor signals such as the ERa/Pax2 complex. ERRa and PGC-1b
mediate positive transcriptional regulation of ERBB2 expression
that can prevail over the negative transcriptional downregulation of
ERBB2 by ERa and Pax2, especially in ER-negative/tamoxifenresistant tumors or in tumors that have lost the expression of Pax2 (10).
In addition, the positive feed-forward loop is further enhanced through
the positive autoregulation of ERRa (40). Solid lines represent
transcriptional regulation and the dashed line indicates the
ERRB2-mediated signaling pathway influencing ERRa transcriptional
activity (33, 34).

The genomic convergence between ERRa and the ERBB2
amplicon described in this study is even more relevant considering the finding of competitive ERRa recruitment at a site
in ERBB2 targeted by ERa/Pax2. This site has been shown to
be involved in maintaining the repressive state of ERBB2 in
ERa-positive endocrine-responsive tumors (10). We also
observed competitive recruitment of ERRa/PGC-1b and
ERa on a site proximal to GRB7. Interestingly, as it is the
case for ERBB2, ERRa, and ERa have opposite transcriptional
effects on the expression of GRB7 in breast cancer cells. The
loss of negative regulation leads to overexpression of ERBB2
and ERBB2-coamplified genes such as GRB7 in luminal breast
tumors and has been associated with a poor response to
targeted endocrine therapy (47). The effect of ERRa/PGC-1b
depletion on tamoxifen-mediated proliferation of Tam-RMCF-7 cells suggests a mechanism whereby the transcriptional regulation of ERBB2 and coamplified genes by these
factors can contribute to the establishment of acquired
tamoxifen resistance. Other ERBB2-coamplified genes have
been associated with the response to trastuzumab or anthracycline-based chemotherapies in single or combination therapies (48). It would therefore be of interest to assess how the
transcriptional regulation of these genes by ERRa/PGC-1b
affects the response to other targeted therapies.

Little is known about the expression and function of PGC1b in breast cancer cells. Here we show that PGC-1b induces
the expression of ERBB2 in breast cancer cells. In line with this
observation, we have recently shown that ERBB2 signaling
also induces the expression of PGC-1b in breast cancer cells
(49). Therefore, together with ERRa, our results suggest that
PGC-1b contributes to the establishment of the aggressive
ERBB2-positive tumors through a positive feed-forward regulatory loop (Fig. 6).
In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that, in
addition to its primary role in the control of cellular energy
metabolic pathways in both normal and cancer cells (32, 35,
49), the ERRa/PGC-1b complex promotes the development of
the ERBB2-positive tumor subtype and tamoxifen resistance
in breast cancer via transcriptional control of the ERRB2
amplicon.
