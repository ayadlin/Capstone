Abstract
Akt activation by the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) has been posited to be a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to
mTORC1 inhibitors (rapalogues) for sarcomas. Here we show that rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of Akt
can occur in an IGF-1R–independent manner. Analysis of synovial sarcoma cell lines showed that either IGF-1R
or the PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFRA) can mediate intrinsic resistance to rapamycin. Repressing expression of
PDGFRA or inhibiting its kinase activity in synovial sarcoma cells blocked rapamycin-induced phosphorylation
of Akt and decreased tumor cell viability. Expression proﬁling of clinical tumor samples revealed that PDGFRA
was the most highly expressed kinase gene among several sarcoma disease subtypes, suggesting that PDGFRA
may be uniquely signiﬁcant for synovial sarcomas. Tumor biopsy analyses from a synovial sarcoma patient treated
with the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus and PDGFRA inhibitor imatinib mesylate conﬁrmed that this drug
combination can impact both mTORC1 and Akt signals in vivo. Together, our ﬁndings deﬁne mechanistic
variations in the intrinsic resistance of synovial sarcomas to rapamycin and suggest therapeutic strategies to
address them. Cancer Res; 72(17); 4515–25. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Evidence for PI3K/Akt/mTOR phosphatidylinositol 3phosphate kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB)/mTOR
(PI3K/AKt/mTOR) pathway activation in sarcomas has
made this a pathway of interest for therapeutic development. Signaling through the pathway begins with ligand
activation of receptor tyrosine kinases [RTK; such as the
insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRA and PDGFRB)]
at the plasma membrane, leading to the recruitment of PI3K
directly to the receptor. PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which then recruits Akt to the membrane
where it is activated by phosphorylation.
Mouse models with activated Akt have shown that oncogenesis through this pathway is dependent upon downstream

activation of mTOR (1–3). mTOR regulates protein translation
through rapamycin- and nutrient-sensitive mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1), which phosphorylates S6K 1/2 (ribosomal S6
kinase 1/2) and 4E-BP1 [eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF4E)-binding protein] to promote mRNA translation. mTOR
also associates with a second rapamycin-resistant complex
known as mTORC2. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at serine 473
(4, 5), which together with threonine 308 phosphorylation
results in full Akt activation (6).
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is activated in sarcomas via
several mechanisms, including genetic mutations within the
pathway [e.g., KIT and PDGFRA mutations in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST); PIK3CA mutations in myxoid/roundcell liposarcomas; ref. 7) or other pathognomonic alterations
that promote reliance upon the pathway [e.g., EWS-FLI-1 gene
fusion-driven oncogenesis is dependent upon IGF-1R in Ewing
sarcoma (EWS; ref. 8)]. These observations led to clinical trials
testing mTORC1 allosteric inhibitors in sarcoma patients.
Rapamycin (sirolimus) was the ﬁrst mTORC1 inhibitor identiﬁed; several rapamycin analogs (known as rapalogues) have
since been developed. Mechanistically, rapalogues bound to
FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) destabilize the multimeric
mTORC1 protein complex, resulting in inhibition of its activity.
The overall clinical activity of these agents is modest, as no
more than 5% of sarcoma patients on these trials had meaningful reductions in tumor size (9, 10).
A mechanism of intrinsic mTORC1 inhibitor resistance
identiﬁed in several cancers, including sarcoma, is the induction of IGF-1R–dependent Akt activation due to a release of
negative feedback inhibition (11–14). Biopsies from rapaloguetreated patients conﬁrmed that Akt activation occurs clinically

(11, 15) and in one study portended a poorer prognosis (15).
The observation that combining rapalogues with IGF-1R inhibitors results in suppression of Akt activation and enhancement of drug-mediated antiproliferative effects in preclinical
models (14) led to efforts to clinically develop this combination
for sarcoma patients. However, combined rapamycin and IGF1R inhibition may not be universally applicable to all sarcoma
subtypes (16–18) and IGF-1R–independent mechanisms of
rapamycin-induced Akt activation may also be important. To
investigate this question, we examined the IGF-1R dependency
of rapamycin-induced Akt activation in a sarcoma cell line
panel using the IGF-1R–targeting antibody R1507 (Roche).
R1507 (Roche) is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1)
that binds the extracellular domain of IGF-1R with high afﬁnity,
causing displacement of IGF-1 and IGF-2 from the receptor as
well as downregulation of receptor levels. R1507 does not cross
react with human or mouse insulin receptor. We discovered
that rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation in sarcoma cell
lines can be either IGF-1R dependent or IGF-1R independent.
In synovial sarcomas, PDGFRA is an alternate RTK that can
mediate this biologic process, and hence, is an attractive
therapeutic target to inhibit in combination with mTORC1.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and drugs
R1507, the humanized monoclonal anti-IGF-1R antibody, was
provided by Roche. Rapamycin was purchased from EMD
Chemicals. Imatinib was purchased from LC Laboratories.
R1507 was stored in a buffered solution of 250 mmol/L trehalose,
20 mmol/L C-histidine, 0.1% Tween 20, and stored at 20 C.
Rapamycin and imatinib were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
and stored at 20 C. IGF-1, EGF, stem cell factor (SCF), PDGF
AB, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell lines
SYO-1 (19) and HS-SY-II (20) synovial sarcoma cell lines were
provided by Dr. Marc Ladanyi (Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center, New York, NY). These cell lines were authenticated by conﬁrming expression of the pathognomonic SYTSSX fusion gene by reverse transcriptase PCR in March 2011.
EWS (TC71, CHP100, A673) and desmoplastic round cell
tumor (JN-DSRCT-1; ref. 21) cell lines were provided by Dr.
Melinda S. Merchant (Center for Cancer Research, NCI/NIH,
Bethesda, MD). Rhabdomyosarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LS141, DDLS), and malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumor (MPNST, ST8814) cell lines were provided by Dr. Samuel
Singer (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York,
NY). Osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection.
Cell viability assays
Cell viability assays were carried out with the Dojindo
Molecular Technologies Kit per manufacturer's instructions.
Brieﬂy, 2,000 to 5,000 cells were plated in 96-well plates and
then treated with the indicated drugs. Media was replaced with
100 mL of media with 10% serum and 10% CCK-8 solution
(Dojindo Molecular Technologies Kit). After 1 hour, the optical
density was read at 450 nm using a Spectra Max 340 PC

(Molecular Devices Corp.) to determine viability. Background
values from negative control wells without cells were subtracted for ﬁnal sample quantiﬁcation.
Western blots
Western blots were carried out as previously described (22).
Brieﬂy, cell lysates were prepared with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. Equal amounts of protein were
electrophoresed on 4% to 12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and
transferred to 0.45-micron nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo
Scientiﬁc). After blocking with 5% milk, membranes were
probed with primary antibodies. Bound antibodies were
detected with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies
(GE Healthcare) and visualized by Enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare). All primary antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling.
RTK assays
RTK assays were conducted with the Proteome Proﬁler
Array Kit (R&D) per manufacturer's instructions.
Immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis
Immunoprecipitation was carried out using 500 mg of total
protein. The cell lysates were incubated with 1:50 dilutions of
PDGFRA antibody or rabbit IgG control antibody overnight at
4 C. The following day 50 mL of protein A/G agarose beads were
added for an overnight incubation at 4 C. Immune complexes
were then washed with RIPA buffer 5 times and suspended in
25 mL of 4X loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot.
Gene silencing
Experiments with siRNA were conducted as previously
described (22). Pooled siRNA constructs targeting PDGFRA
(L-003162) and nontargeting, control siRNA (D-001810)
were purchased from Dharmacon (ON-TARGET plus SMART
pool). The SYT-SSX siRNA was previously published and validated (23); the sense and antisense sequences 50 -CCAGAUCAUGCCCAAGAAGdTdT-30 and 50 -CUUCUUGGGCAUGAUCUGGdTdT-30 target the breakpoint of both type 1 and type
2 fusions.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was carried out as previously described (24).
Gene-speciﬁc probe and primer sets from TaqMan gene
expression assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to detect
PDGFRA, SYT-SSX (23), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcripts. The relative expression of
PDGFRA was calculated by normalizing to GAPDH.
PDGFRA overexpression
The PDGFRA expression plasmid was provided by Dr. Marc
Ladanyi (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York,
NY). Cells were transiently transfected with empty vector and
PDGFRA expression plasmids as previously described (25).
Protein stability experiments
Synovial sarcoma cells were transfected with control or SYTSSX siRNA (Dharmacon) as described above. After transfection,

cells were treated with 100 mg/mL cycloheximide (SigmaAldrich) for the time points indicated. The cell lysates were
prepared and analyzed by Western blot. For band densitometry, an image of the Western blot was saved in high resolution
gray color/JPEG format and analyzed with ImageJ software.
Expression microarray analysis
RNA was isolated from 139 sarcoma patient tumor samples
and 17 cell lines or xenografts representing 5 different sarcoma
histologic subtypes. RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix U133A
arrays. Microarray data were normalized with the robust
multiarray average method. These expression microarray data
are previously published (26) and are freely available at: http://
cbio.mskcc.org/Public/sarcoma_array_data/.
We identiﬁed 739 probe sets on a U133A chip corresponding
to 432 genes with kinase domains based on searches of the
Affymetrix annotation database, published data, and genome
databases. This represented 83% of the 518 known protein
kinase genes. To identify differentially expressed kinase genes,
we used 2-tailed t tests with a restrictive Bonferroni correction
method with a cut-off P value 0.01 for multiple comparisons.
Differential expression of kinase genes in synovial sarcoma was
deﬁned relative to the other 4 groups as a whole.
Immunohistochemistry analysis of clinical cases
For 57 synovial sarcoma cases, immunohistochemistry
(IHC) was carried out on 4-micron formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁnembedded slides using PDGFRA and IGF-1R antibodies (Ventana, prediluted) following standard protocols. The scoring for
both antibodies was quantitated on a 0 to 2þ scale: 0 ¼ no or
faint/weak staining, 1þ ¼ moderate staining, and 2þ ¼ strong
staining. Staining of 2þ was considered positive for PDGFRA.
1þ and 2þ were considered positive for IGF-1R. Photomicrographs were taken with our Leica DM5500 microscope and
Openlab 5.0 imaging software.
Western blot of clinical tumor samples
Pretreatment (within 2 weeks of drug therapy) and on
treatment (between weeks 2 and 3 of therapy) biopsies were
carried out on a patient participating in a National Cancer
Institute (NCI) study entitled, "A Phase 1b/2 Study of Imatinib
in Combination with Everolimus in Synovial Sarcoma" (NCI#
8603). This protocol was reviewed and approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Review Board
and has been registered to www.ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial registration ID: NCT01281865). Informed consent was obtained to
participate in the therapeutic study as well as the research
biopsies. For Western blot analysis of frozen tumor samples,
250 mL of cold RIPA buffer was added to the sample grinding kit
tube (GE Healthcare), followed by a ﬂash frozen tumor sample
(1-2 mm). The tumor was disintegrated by grinding using a
pestle. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was
transferred to a fresh tube. Protein concentrations were measured and analyzed by Western blot.
Statistical analysis
All in vitro experiments were carried out at least 2 to 3 times.
SD was calculated where indicated.

Results
Evaluating combined mTORC1 and IGF-1R inhibition in
a panel of sarcoma cell lines reveals both IGF-1R
dependence and independence
The impact of mTORC1 and IGF-1R inhibition with rapamycin and R1507, respectively, was evaluated in a panel of 12
non-GIST soft-tissue and bone sarcoma cell lines. Histologies
represented in the panel included synovial sarcoma (HS-SY-II,
SYO-1), EWS (TC71, CHP100, A673), embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RD), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LS141, DDLS),
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST, ST8814),
osteosarcoma (SAOS-2), and desmoplastic small round cell
tumor (JN-DSRCT-1). In all the cells, rapamycin inhibited S6
ribosomal protein (S6 RP) phosphorylation (at serines 235/
236), consistent with mTORC1 pathway inhibition (Fig. 1).
Rapamycin also increased Akt phosphorylation at serine 473
in 11 of the 12 cell lines (JN-DSRCT-1 was the exception; Fig. 1).
In all the cell lines with high IGF-1R protein, R1507 reduced
IGF-1R protein levels, indicative of receptor internalization/
degradation, a marker of antibody-mediated IGF-1R targeting
(27). The impact of R1507-mediated IGF-1R inhibition was
grouped into 2 categories. For 7 cell lines (designated Class I),
R1507 partially or completely suppressed rapamycin-induced
Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1). In almost all these cells, R1507
alone also suppressed Akt phosphorylation, suggesting a
degree of generalized IGF-1R dependence in Class I cells. In
the 5 remaining cell lines (designated Class II), R1507 failed to
suppress Akt phosphorylation alone or in combination with
rapamycin (Fig. 1). The impact upon Akt phosphorylation
correlated to tumor cell viability: the R1507 and rapamycin
combination cooperatively suppressed sarcoma cell viability in
only the Class I, but not Class II, cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We concluded that Akt activation in Class II cell lines was
mediated through IGF-1R–independent mechanisms, rendering them resistant to strategies directed at IGF-1R inhibition,
either alone or in combination with rapamycin.
Exogenous growth factors are necessary for rapamycininduced Akt activation in both Class I and Class II
synovial sarcoma cell lines
Although susceptibility to IGF-1R targeting in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines has been directly correlated to receptor
expression levels (28), IGF-1R independence in this panel was
observed both in cells with detectable IGF-1R protein (SYO-1,
JN-DSRCT-1) and those with marginal receptor expression
(MPNST, ST8814, and DDLS; Fig. 1). In fact, IGF-1R expression
in the R1507-resistant synovial sarcoma cell line SYO-1 was
comparable with that in the Class I synovial sarcoma cell line
HS-SY-II (Fig. 1), showing that alternate mechanism(s) of
rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation may be relevant even
in the context of intact IGF-1R expression. We next focused
upon delineating the basis for this differential susceptibility to
IGF-1R targeting observed in the synovial sarcoma cell lines.
To determine whether Akt activation in these cells is dependent upon growth factor signaling, serum-starved HS-SY-II and
SYO-1 cells were treated with either vehicle or rapamycin in the
presence or absence of serum (Fig. 2A). In both cell lines,
rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation was observed only in

the context of serum, establishing that the exogenous addition
of one or more growth factor ligand(s) is/are required for both
classes of cells. Consistent with our original classiﬁcation,
puriﬁed IGF-1 was sufﬁcient to restore rapamycin-induced
Akt phosphorylation in serum-starved HS-SY-II cells (Class
I; Fig. 2A). IGF-1 addition to serum-starved SYO-1 cells only
resulted in increased basal Akt phosphorylation, but not
rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation. Hence, although
SYO-1 cells possess a functional IGF-1R signaling apparatus
that can be stimulated to transduce signals to Akt, this pathway
is not activated in response to mTORC1 inhibition.
PDGFRA mediates rapamycin-induced Akt
phosphorylation in SYO-1 cells
To identify the potential RTK(s) responsible for the induction of Akt phosphorylation in rapamycin-treated SYO-1 cells,
the phosphorylation status of 42 RTKs in both HS-SY-II
and SYO-1 cells were proﬁled using an RTK antibody array
(Proteome Proﬁler; R&D Systems) in the presence of serum
(Fig. 2B). A strong phosphorylated IGF-1R (and insulin receptor) signal was observed in HS-SY-II cells but not in SYO-1 cells,
suggesting baseline IGF-1R activation in the Class I cell line but
not the Class II. Conversely, a strong phosphorylated PDGFR
alpha (PDGFRA) signal was present in SYO-1 cells, whereas
only a modest one was detected in HS-SY-II (Fig. 2B). This
correlated to higher total PDGFRA receptor levels in SYO-1
cells compared with HS-SY-II (Fig. 2C). No signal was detected
for phosphorylated PDGFR beta (PDGFRB) in the RTK antibody array. Other RTKs activated at baseline included EGF
receptor in both cell lines and Erbb2 (HS-SY-II only).
To determine whether activation of a singular RTK pathway
is sufﬁcient to facilitate rapamycin-induced Akt phosphoryla-

tion, the impact of rapamycin upon Akt was tested in SYO-1
cells exposed in isolation to puriﬁed growth factor ligands that
activate each of the RTKs identiﬁed in the antibody arrays (Fig.
2D). Each growth factor with the exception of the c-kit ligand
(SCF) stimulated Akt phosphorylation, but only the addition of
PDGF AB ligand recapitulated rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation observed with serum addition. Because commercial Western blot antibodies directed against speciﬁc phosphorylated sites on RTKs, including PDGFRA, were not sufﬁciently sensitive or speciﬁc for serum-exposed sarcoma cells,
we evaluated PDGFRA phosphorylation status by immunoprecipitating the receptor and analyzing the immune complexes for the presence of phosphorylated tyrosines by Western
blot. In the presence of serum, rapamycin increased PDGFRA
tyrosine phosphorylation, consistent with receptor activation
upon mTORC1 inhibition (Fig. 2E). RTK arrays carried out on
vehicle- and rapamycin-treated cells in the presence of serum
conﬁrmed that none of the other assayed RTKs were activated
in response to rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To assess whether PDGFRA is required for rapamycininduced Akt phosphorylation, pooled PDGFRA-targeting
siRNA constructs (Dharmacon; ON-TARGET plus SMART
pool) were transfected into SYO-1 and HS-SY-II cells to suppress receptor expression. Decreasing PDGFRA levels abrogated rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation in only SYO-1
cells, not HS-SY-II (Fig. 3A). We next used the small molecule
inhibitor imatinib mesylate to assess the impact of pharmacologically inhibiting PDGFRA kinase activity. Imatinib alone
and in combination with rapamycin inhibited PDGFRA phosphorylation in both SYO-1 and HS-SY-II cells, but suppressed
rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation only in SYO-1 cells
(Fig. 3B). Although imatinib can inhibit the activity of other

E, immunoprecipitation Western blot analysis of PDGFRA phosphorylation at tyrosine residues. SYO-1 cells were treated with vehicle or rapamycin for

were then electrophoresed into a polyacrylamide gel for Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. IP ab, immunoprecipitation antibody; W, Western
blot antibody.

PDGFRA-related type III RTKs such as PDGFRB and c-kit/
CD117, each of these receptors were not detectable by Western
blot in either SYO-1 or HS-SY-II cells [Fig. 2C; or in the
phosphorylated RTK array after rapamycin (Supplementary
Fig. S2)]. Furthermore, imatinib inhibited Akt phosphorylation
induced by rapamycin in serum-starved SYO-1 cells exposed to
PDGF AB ligand in isolation, afﬁrming that imatinib can
speciﬁcally modulate PDGF-mediated Akt phosphorylation
(Fig. 3C). As was observed with R1507, the differential impact
upon Akt phosphorylation correlated to cellular viability as the
combination cooperatively suppressed tumor cell proliferation
in only the SYO-1 cells, and not HS-SY-II, in the context of
serum (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data showed that in
SYO-1 cells, PDGFRA induces Akt phosphorylation in response
to mTORC1 inhibition, suggesting that targeting alternate
RTKs other than IGF-1R may be critical for overcoming
intrinsic sarcoma cell resistance to mTORC1 inhibition.
High PDGFRA expression is a critical determinant of
imatinib sensitivity and can be regulated by the synovial
sarcoma gene fusion SYT-SSX
Because SYO-1 cells express higher total PDGFRA protein
levels than HS-SY-II cells (Fig. 2C), we hypothesized that the

www.aacrjournals.org

differential susceptibility to PDGFRA targeting in the synovial
sarcoma cell lines may be related to this discrepancy in
PDGFRA. To test whether higher PDGFRA expression could
confer greater susceptibility to imatinib-mediated regulation
of Akt phosphorylation, HS-SY-II cells were transfected with
either a PDGFRA expression plasmid or empty vector and then
subjected to drug treatment. Transfection of the PDGFRA
expression plasmid resulted in 2.6-fold higher PDGFRA expression relative to empty vector–transfected cells (calculated by
densitometry). High PDGFRA expression conferred a new
susceptibility to imatinib-mediated inhibition of rapamycininduced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the
level of PDGFRA expression may be a critical determinant of
RTK dependence.
We next investigated the potential mechanism by which
PDGFRA is differentially expressed in SYO-1 and HS-SY-II cells.
Essentially all synovial sarcomas possess the pathognomonic
t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation that produces the fusion gene
SYT (SS18)-SSX. Variability in the Xp11 breakpoint produces a
fusion of the SYT gene with either the SSX1 or SSX2 (and rarely
SSX4) genes. The ratio of SYT-SSX1 (type 1 fusion) to SYT-SSX2
(type 2 fusion) tumors is close to 2:1 (29, 30), and each fusion
impacts tumor biology in clinically distinct ways (30).

analyzed by immunoblot. B, Immunoprecipitation Western blot and Western blot analysis of SYO-1 and HS-SY-II cells treated with rapamycin and imatinib

The HS-SY-II cell line possesses the type 1 fusion (20), and
the SYO-1 cell line the type 2 (19). To investigate how each
fusion type may contribute to PDGFRA expression levels, cells
were transfected with an siRNA duplex that can suppress the
expression of both SYT-SSX fusion types by targeting the
breakpoint region of the translocation (the design and validation of this siRNA construct has been previously published
(ref. 23; see Materials and Methods for sequence). Whereas
decreasing type 2 gene fusion expression failed to alter IGF-1R
or PDGFRA expression in SYO-1 cells, decreasing type 1 fusion
expression in HS-SY-II cells increased PDGFRA protein levels

(Fig. 4B), implying that the type 1 fusion gene can negatively
regulate PDGFRA expression. Both PDGFRA transcript levels
and protein half-life were examined to better understand the
mechanism by which reducing fusion gene expression could
impact PDGFRA levels. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed
only a modest increase in PDGFRA mRNA levels in HS-SY-II
cells after suppression of SYT-SSX1 expression, although no
change was detected in SYO-1 cells (Fig. 4C). Using cycloheximide to block mRNA translation revealed that at baseline, the
PDGFRA protein half-life in SYO-1 cells (t1/2 ¼ 1 to 2 hours) is
more than 2-fold longer than in HS-SY-II cells (t1/2 < 0.5 hours;

Figure 4. The level of PDGFRA expression determines susceptibility to imatinib regulation of Akt phosphorylation and is negatively regulated by the SYT-SSX1
fusion gene product. A, Western blot of HS-SY-II cells treated with rapamycin and imatinib alone or in combination after transfection of a PDGFRA expression
plasmid. Cells were transfected with a PDGFRA expression plasmid or empty vector for more than 24 hours and then were treated with vehicle,
1 nmol/L rapamycin, 1 mmol/L imatinib, or both for 6 hours and Western blot was conducted. B, Western blot of SYO-1 and HS-SY-II cells transfected with
control or SYT-SSX targeting siRNAs. Cells were transfected with the siRNA constructs for 48 hours and Western blots were then conducted. The SYT-SSX
fusion protein was detected with an antibody targeting the N-terminus of the SYT protein. C, quantitative real-time PCR of SYO-1 and HS-SY-II cells
transfected with control and SYT-SSX targeting siRNA duplexes. The CT values for PDGFRA in each condition were normalized to GAPDH CT values. The
relative quantiﬁcation (RQ) for SYT-SSX siRNA-treated samples was determined relative to the control siRNA-treated samples for each cell line (RQ for
control siRNA samples were set to 1). D, Western blot of HS-SY-II and SYO-1 cells transfected with control or SYT-SSX targeting siRNA duplexes and then
treated with cycloheximide to evaluate PDGFRA protein stability. The PDGFRA Western blot bands were quantiﬁed by band densitometry. CHX,
cycloheximide.

Fig. 4D). siRNA-mediated downregulation of SYT-SSX1 expression in HS-SY-II cells increased PDGFRA protein stability with
a longer half-life approximating that observed in SYO-1 cells
(Fig. 4D). Alternatively, no changes in PDGFRA protein stability
were observed in SYO-1 cells with SYT-SSX2 downregulation.
These data suggest that the SYT-SSX1 gene product can downregulate PDGFRA expression in synovial sarcoma cells via
multiple mechanisms.
PDGFRA transcripts are highly overexpressed in synovial
sarcomas relative to other sarcoma subtypes
To assess the clinical relevance of PDGFRA for synovial
sarcoma, Affymetrix U133 arrays were used to quantify the
transcript levels of kinase genes from 5 different sarcoma
subtypes derived from 139 primary patient tumor specimens
and 17 cell lines and xenografts: synovial sarcoma (46 patient

cases and 2 cell lines), desmoplastic round cell tumor (28
patient cases, 2 xenografts, and 1 cell line), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (23 patient cases), alveolar soft part sarcoma (14
patient cases and 2 xenografts), and EWS (28 cases and 10 cell
lines). The 739 probe sets on the U133A chip corresponded to
432 genes with kinase domains, representing 83% of the 518
known protein kinase genes (Note: this microarray expression
analysis was used in a previous publication as a comparator
data set for a study of myxoid chondrosarcoma; ref. 26).
Among all the kinase genes evaluated in these 5 sarcoma
subtypes, PDGFRA in synovial sarcomas was the most overexpressed: synovial sarcoma cases had 14.5-fold higher levels
of PDGFRA than the other 4 tumor types (Fig. 5A), representing the highest disparity in gene expression discovered
in this analysis. In 25 synovial tumor cases and the 2 cell
lines, no PDGFRA kinase (exons 12–16) or transmembrane

Figure 5. High PDGFRA expression is unique to synovial sarcomas and can be targeted with imatinib in combination with everolimus to inhibit both Akt and
mTORC1 substrate phosphorylation. A, PDGFRA transcript levels detected with Affymetrix U133A arrays. A total of 139 sarcoma patient tumor samples and
17 cell lines and xenografts were analyzed. Samples 3 to 33 are desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT; 28 cases, 2 xenografts, and 1 cell line); samples
34 to 56 are alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMS; 23 cases), samples 57 to 72 are alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS; 14 cases and 2 xenografts); samples 73
to 120 are synovial sarcomas (46 cases and 2 cell lines); and samples 121 to 158 are EWS (28 cases and 10 cell lines). B, PDGFRA and IGF-1R protein in 57
synovial sarcoma cases were assessed by IHC. The graph represents the percentage of cases positive for each of these proteins. C, Western blot and
immunohistochemical analysis of pretherapy (within 2 weeks of the start of drug therapy) and ontherapy (between weeks 2 and 3 of drug therapy) tumor
biopsies obtained from a patient treated with everolimus (5 mg daily) and imatinib (400 mg daily). Biopsies were obtained from a tumor located on the patient's
extremity. Lysates were created from frozen tissue biopsy samples and Western blot carried out. IHC was carried out on ﬁxed tissues.

(exons 18–21) domain mutations were found. IHC conducted on another set of 57 synovial sarcomas showed that
70.2% (40 of 57) of the tumors expressed PDGFRA protein,
whereas only 35.1% (20 of 57) were positive for IGF-1R (Fig.
5B). This synovial sarcoma tissue analysis establishes that
wild-type PDGFRA is uniquely, highly expressed in synovial
sarcomas.
Preliminary clinical evidence of inhibiting Akt
phosphorylation with imatinib in combination with
mTORC1 inhibition
We are currently conducting a NCI phase Ib/II clinical
trial testing the combination of the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus (a rapamycin analog or rapalogue) and imatinib in
patients with PDGFRA-positive, recurrent, metastatic synovial sarcoma (NCI# 8603; trial registration ID: NCT01281865).
Pretherapy (within 2 weeks of starting drugs) and ontherapy
(between weeks 2 and 3 of therapy) tumor biopsies were
carried out on a patient who experienced a reduction in the
size of lung metastases with everolimus (5 mg oral daily) and

4522

Cancer Res; 72(17) September 1, 2012

imatinib (400 mg oral daily; Fig. 5C). Western blot analysis
with protein normalized by both tubulin and glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels revealed a substantial loss of phosphorylated and total S6 RP and Akt with
everolimus/imatinib therapy (Fig. 5C). IHC of these same
tissues revealed a corresponding loss of tumor cellularity,
decreased Ki-67 staining, and loss of phosphorylated S6 RP
in the tumor cells (Fig. 5C). These data showed that combined S6 RP and Akt inhibition can be achieved clinically
with rapamycin and imatinib in synovial sarcoma.

Discussion
The hypothesis that induction of IGF-1R–dependent Akt
activation is a critical mechanism of intrinsic resistance to
rapalogue therapy has led to the development of several early
phase clinical trials evaluating combined mTORC1 and IGF-1R
inhibition (31–34). Early results have suggested that this
approach may have greater clinical efﬁcacy than treatment
with agents that inhibit mTORC1 or IGF-1R alone (33). Nonetheless, it is also apparent that IGF-1R inhibition will likely not

PDGFRA Can Mediate Rapamycin Resistance in Synovial Sarcoma

be effective for reversing intrinsic rapamycin resistance in all
sarcomas. A recent phase I study reported that 10 of 17
sarcoma patients treated with mTORC1 and IGF-1R inhibitors
in combination still experienced increased tumor growth (34).
Recent drug screens in xenograft mouse models have also
suggested that this combinatorial approach may have limitations (16–18). The R1507þ/ rapamycin sarcoma cell line
screen presented here conﬁrms that IGF-1R inhibition will
not be an universally effective approach for overcoming intrinsic rapalogue resistance.
The identiﬁcation of IGF-1R dependence and independence
in 2 synovial sarcoma cell lines provided the opportunity to
study an alternate mechanism of intrinsic rapamycin resistance in tumor cells of a shared histology, driven by similar
genetic alterations (the SYT-SSX fusion genes). Previous studies
investigating IGF-1R targeting in synovial sarcoma cell lines
with small molecule inhibitors produced conﬂicting conclusions about IGF-1R dependence. One study argued that the
IGF-1R kinase inhibitor NVP-AEW541 can inhibit the proliferation of several synovial sarcoma cell lines (35), whereas
another observed that these antiproliferative effects could only
be achieved with micromolar NVP-AEW541 concentrations 10to 50-fold higher than those required for IGF-1R inhibition (36),
implicating off-target drug effects rather than IGF-1R dependence. The impact of IGF-1R inhibition upon Akt phosphorylation has only been explored in the narrow biologic context of
serum-starved cells exposed to puriﬁed IGF ligands (35, 37),
rather than in the context of serum with multiple ligandstimulated RTK pathways. Taking a more selective approach
to receptor targeting with the monoclonal antibody R1507 and
conducting these experiments in the presence of serum, we
evaluated the contribution of IGF-1R and alternate RTK pathways to the induction of Akt phosphorylation following rapamycin exposure.
In SYO-1 cells, the inability to abrogate rapamycininduced Akt phosphorylation with IGF-1R inhibition was
not due to a lack of receptor expression, as it was expressed
at levels comparable with those in the IGF-1R–dependent
cell line HS-SY-II. The phosphorylated RTK antibody arrays
of serum exposed SYO-1 cells revealed a lack of phosphorylated IGF-1R, implying the receptor is not activated at
baseline despite intact expression. Instead, we found that
high PDGFRA expression mediates Akt phosphorylation in
response to rapamycin in SYO-1 cells. Data from our expression microarray analysis showed that PDGFRA is uniquely
overexpressed in synovial sarcomas relative to other sarcoma subtypes (also indicated in a smaller study of 16 synovial
sarcomas; ref. 38), corresponding to a higher rate of PDGFRA
protein immunohistochemical positivity than IGF-1R in
patient tissue samples (Fig. 5B). Notably, high expression
of a PDGFR pathway component has been shown to be
sufﬁcient to drive oncogenesis in other sarcoma subtypes.
The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion gene in dermatoﬁbrosarcoma
protuberans results in PDGF BB ligand overexpression,
hyperactivation of the PDGFR pathway, and susceptibility
to imatinib (39). Recent studies have reported that high
levels of phosphorylated PDGFRA in rhabdomyosarcoma
cell lines correlated to susceptibility to PDGFRA inhibition

www.aacrjournals.org

achieved with sunitinib (40). For synovial sarcoma, high
PDGFRA is potentially sufﬁcient for establishing it as the
dominant RTK responsible for the induction of Akt phosphorylation in response to rapalogue treatment.
Importantly, the sarcoma microarray data presented here
also revealed a degree of heterogeneity with regard to how highly
abundant PDGFRA transcripts may be among synovial sarcomas (Fig. 5A). In the synovial sarcoma cell lines, differences in
PDGFRA expression translated to differences in PDGFRA dependence for rapamycin-induced Akt activation: resistance to
PDGFRA targeting was observed in the lower PDGFRA-expressing HS-SY-II cells, whereas susceptibility to receptor targeting
was found in the higher PDGFRA-expressing SYO-1 cells. Furthermore, exogenous overexpression of PDGFRA in HS-SY-II
cells conferred a new susceptibility to imatinib suppression of
rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). A recently
published phosphoproteomic analysis of sarcoma cell lines
conﬁrmed that baseline RTK activation and dependence can
vary in different sarcomas (41), suggesting that the speciﬁc RTK
responsible for mediating intrinsic rapamycin resistance may
vary depending upon sarcoma histologic subtype or the genetic
context. This phenomenon has also been observed in other
cancers, for instance in pleural mesothelioma (42). Although
PDGFRA does not play a role in rapamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation for HS-SY-II cells, the receptor still may contribute
to pathway signaling in other contexts. PDGFRA knockdown
alone in HS-SY-II did result in decreased S6 RP phosphorylation
and increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), whereas PDGFRA
overexpression resulted in the opposite changes (Fig. 4A). These
observations suggest that at baseline PDGFRA may regulate
mTOR activity in these cells and manipulating receptor expression can trigger changes to feedback pathways leading to Akt.
What remains to be better deﬁned is how RTK expression is
differentially regulated among synovial sarcomas. We found
that the speciﬁc SYT-SSX fusion type expressed by the tumor
can differentially impact PDGFRA expression. The type 1 fusion
in HS-SY-II cells negatively regulates PDGFRA expression,
whereas the type 2 fusion in SYO-1 cells does not seem to
regulate PDGFRA expression at all. The SYT-SSX gene fusions
are generally thought to promote oncogenesis in synovial
sarcomas by altering chromatin remodeling and dysregulating
the expression of several target genes (43). The impact of the
type 1 fusion upon PDGFRA expression does not seem to be
limited to regulating PDGFRA transcript abundance, which
was only modestly altered by fusion gene downregulation, but
also extended to regulating PDGFRA protein half-life. Whether
fusion type can reliably predict meaningful differences in
PDGFRA expression in synovial sarcomas is not clear. Although
a modest trend toward higher PDGFRA transcript levels in
type 2 over type 1 fusions was observed in the microarray
analysis (data not shown), without the ability to assess differences in PDGFRA posttranscriptional stability and/or reliably
quantify PDGFRA protein levels in clinical samples, an adequate analysis of this question is not yet possible. In the
ongoing phase II study evaluating the everolimus and imatinib
combination in synovial sarcoma patients, clinical activity will
be correlated back to fusion status to explore how fusion type
may inﬂuence susceptibility to PDGFRA targeting.

Ho et al.

As for the mechanism by which rapamycin activates
PDGFRA, mTORC1 inhibition has been shown to increase
PDGFR transcript levels in hepatocellular tumor cells (44) and
in mTOR activated TSC1/ or TSC2/ mouse cells (45). In
SYO-1 cells, rapamycin increased PDGFRA phosphorylation,
but did not upregulate PDGFRA expression (Figs. 2E). Furthermore, the molecular events required for PDGFRA activation seem to be different from those critical for rapamycininduced IGF-1R activation: although rapamycin resulted in
decreased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1
(IRS-1, an IGF-1R adaptor protein; ref. 11) and decreased
expression of growth factor receptor-bound protein 10
(Grb10, a negative regulator of IGF-1R; refs. 46, 47) in HSSY-II cells, these IGF-1R activating changes were not observed
in SYO-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Differences in the
baseline expression or response to rapamycin of these molecules also did not seem to correlate to classiﬁcations of IGF1R dependency (Class I versus Class II; Supplementary Fig.
S3B).
In summary, intrinsic resistance to rapalogue therapy mediated by the induction of Akt activation can occur through
different mechanisms. In synovial sarcoma, uniquely high
levels of PDGFRA expression can translate to the usage of this
RTK for rapalogue-induced Akt activation, providing a new
disease-speciﬁc mode of resistance that may be exploited
therapeutically.
