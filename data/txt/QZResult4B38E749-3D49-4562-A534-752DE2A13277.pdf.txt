Abstract
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a major target for cancer drug development. PI-103 is an
isoform-selective class I PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. The aims of this work were as follows: first, to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to identify and develop a robust pharmacodynamic
(PD) biomarker for target inhibition and potentially tumor response following PI3K inhibition; second, to evaluate mechanisms underlying the MRS-detected changes. Treatment of human PTEN null PC3 prostate and
PIK3CA mutant HCT116 colon carcinoma cells with PI-103 resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent
decrease in phosphocholine (PC) and total choline (tCho) levels (P < 0.05) detected by phosphorus (31P)- and
proton (1H)-MRS. In contrast, the cytotoxic microtubule inhibitor docetaxel increased glycerophosphocholine
and tCho levels in PC3 cells. PI-103–induced MRS changes were associated with alterations in the protein expression levels of regulatory enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including choline kinase α (ChoKα), fatty acid
synthase (FAS), and phosphorylated ATP-citrate lyase (pACL). However, a strong correlation (r2 = 0.9, P = 0.009)
was found only between PC concentrations and ChoKα expression but not with FAS or pACL. This study identified inhibition of ChoKα as a major cause of the observed change in PC levels following PI-103 treatment. We
also showed the capacity of 1H-MRS, a clinically well-established technique with higher sensitivity and wider
applicability compared with 31P-MRS, to assess response to PI-103. Our results show that monitoring the effects
of PI3K inhibitors by MRS may provide a noninvasive PD biomarker for PI3K inhibition and potentially of tumor
response during early-stage clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors. Cancer Res; 70(13); 5507–17. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is increasingly
used for the noninvasive assessment of cellular metabolism,
both in vitro (tissue cultures, body fluids, tissue extracts, and
isolated tissues) and in vivo (small animals and humans; ref.
1). Phosphorous (31P)-MRS measures signals from endogenous metabolites such as ATP, indicative of cellular energy

status, as well as phosphocholine (PC), phosphoethanolamine
(PE), glycerophosphocholine (GPC), and glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) arising from the synthetic and degradative
pathways of major phospholipids (1). Proton (1H)-MRS can
measure the total choline (tCho) peak consisting of PC,
GPC, free choline, and corresponding ethanolamine metabolites (1). The levels of lactate, creatine, glutamine/glutamate,
and other amino acids can also be obtained from the 1H-MR
spectra (1). In the field of cancer, MRS has emerged as a
promising tool for characterizing disease and assessing response to therapy (2, 3). Higher levels of phosphomonoesters
comprising PC and PE were observed in tumors compared
with the corresponding normal tissues (4, 5). Other studies
showed that progression from the normal to the malignant
phenotype is associated with an increase in PC and tCho
(6). Recently, an increase in the MRS-detected PC/GPC ratio
was reported in a mouse model of early gastrointestinal tumorigenesis, highlighting its use as a potential biomarker
for monitoring disease progression (7). Similar findings have
also been reported in human colorectal cancer (8).
With the emergence of promising new molecularly targeted agents for the treatment of cancer (9), new technologies for the screening and early detection of response to
therapy are required. The development of noninvasive end

points such as MRS is desirable because it may avoid the
need for tumor biopsy (10, 11).
One oncogenic pathway that is highly and frequently activated in a wide range of tumor types is the production of the
phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate by
phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), triggering cell growth,
proliferation, survival, motility, invasion, and angiogenesis
(12). The use of the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and
LY294002, despite their lack of specificity, has provided initial
proof of concept for the anticancer activity of PI3K inhibitors; more recently, compounds that inhibit class I PI3K with
increased specificity have been discovered (13–17), including
the pyridofuropyrimidine lead compound PI-103 that we
identified (14). Detailed characterization was carried out on
this compound (17–20). PI-103 showed antiproliferative activity against a range of human cancer cell lines in vitro as
well as significant antitumor activity in human tumor xenografts in athymic mice (19, 20). PI-103 is now used widely as a
chemical tool compound (17) and has been recommended
(21) as a replacement for the less potent and selective
LY294002 when used alongside wortmannin to show the involvement of PI3K in cellular processes.
Using MRS, we have previously reported that blockade of
PI3K with LY294002 and wortmannin in human breast cancer cells was associated with a decrease in PC levels as well
as (LY294002 only) an elevation in GPC content (22). With
the emergence of more selective and drug-like PI3K inhibitors, we have used MRS to test whether the novel class I
PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor
PI-103 would result in similar metabolic alterations in human carcinoma cell lines with activating genetic abnormalities in the PI3K pathway. MRS-detected changes were
compared with the effects of the cytotoxic microtubule inhibitor docetaxel that is widely used in prostate cancer, with
the objective of ruling out nonspecific antiproliferative effects associated with cytotoxicity. We have also investigated
potential mechanisms underlying the observed metabolic
changes. We report a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in PC and tCho levels following PI3K pathway inhibition with PI-103. Furthermore, we discovered that PC
concentrations correlated with choline kinase α (ChoKα)
protein expression levels, indicating that ChoKα deregulation
following PI3K inhibition is one of the main mechanisms underlying the reduction in PC detected by MRS.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment
The human PTEN null PC3 prostate adenocarcinoma and
PIK3CA mutant HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell lines
(American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM
(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS (PAA Labs
Ltd), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Life
Technologies) at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were cultured according to the supplier's instructions and used at passages 6 to
12. Cell viability was routinely >90%, as judged by trypan
blue exclusion. Both cell lines routinely tested negative for
Mycoplasma by PCR. PTEN status was verified by protein ex-

5508

Cancer Res; 70(13) July 1, 2010

pression using Western blotting in house, and PIK3CA status
was determined or verified experimentally by sequencing. In
the case of the HCT116 cell line, single nucleotide polymorphism profiling was also used to confirm that the genotypes
matched those provided in the Cancer Genome Project Cosmic database.
Both cell lines were treated with PI-103. PC3 cells were also treated with docetaxel (Sigma). GI50 values (concentrations causing 50% inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells)
were determined using the sulforhodamine B assay following
96 hours continuous exposure to compounds (20). Cell culture conditions were selected to ensure similar availability of
choline per cell in control and treated cells over the time
course of treatment. At the required time points, cells underwent trypsinization and trypan blue exclusion assay (23). The
effect of treatment on cell number was monitored by counting the number of viable attached cells in a treated flask and
comparing that number with the number of attached cells in
a control flask.
Flow cytometry
Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously described
(24). Cell volume was estimated using the Time of Flight parameter on the Elite ESP Beckman Coulter (High Wycombe)
cell sorter. Pulse width is measured as the particle (cell) moves
through the laser beam and the width of the laser beam is subtracted, through machine hardware, from the measurement.
The calibration of the machine for diameter measurements
was performed using beads of known diameters: 5, 10, and
15 μm. Assuming a spherical particle, a quantity proportional
to volume was calculated by measuring cell diameter from a
pulse width signal, using the formula (4/3 × π × r3).
Immunoblotting
Western blotting was performed as previously described
(22). Western blots were probed for pAKT (Ser473), total
AKT, pS6RP (Ser240/244), total S6RP (Cell Signaling), and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon). Protein expression levels of ChoKα were detected using the human ChoKα monoclonal antibody (25). The blots were also
probed for fatty acid synthase (FAS; Cell Signaling) as well as
phosphorylated (Ser454) and total ATP-citrate lyase (ACL, Cell
Signaling). Western blot bands were quantified by densitometry using Image Quant version 5 (GE Healthcare).
In vitro 1H- and 31P-MRS of cell extracts
To obtain an MR spectrum, an average of 4 × 107 cells in
logarithmic phase were extracted from cell culture using the
dual phase extraction method, as previously described (24, 26).
Before acquisition of the MRS spectra, the water-soluble metabolites were resuspended in deuterium oxide for 1H-MRS or
deuterium oxide with 10 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.2) for 31P-MRS.

H- and 1H-decoupled 31P-MR spectra were acquired and metabolites were quantified as previously reported (24).

NOTE: Data are expressed as %T/C and presented as the mean ± SD, n ≥ 3. A two-tailed unpaired t test was used to compare
results in treated cells to controls. GPE in PC3 cells was not consistently detectable due to the low levels of this metabolite and was
not affected by treatment with PI-103. Experiments were not designed to measure levels of other metabolites present in 1H-MR
spectra such as lactate, alanine, glutamine/glutamate, or acetate.

(GI50 = 100 nmol/L). Examples of the 31P-MR spectra of
control and PI-103–treated PC3 cells are illustrated in
Fig. 1A. As summarized in Table 1, 31P-MRS showed that
PI-103 treatment for 24 hours led to a significant concentration-dependent reduction in PC, PE, and nucleotide
triphosphate (NTP) levels. Levels of PC were reduced from
15.6 ± 1.4 fmol/cell in DMSO-treated control cells to 12.0 ±
0.7 fmol/cell, P < 0.003 using 1× GI50, and to 9.0 ± 0.2 fmol/cell,
P < 0.0001 using PI-103 at 10× GI50 (Supplementary Table
S1). PI-103 at 5× GI50 caused a time-dependent decrease in
PC starting from 6 hours following treatment. For example,
at 8 hours, PI-103–treated cells contained 13.2 ± 2.0 fmol/
cell compared with 19.3 ± 3.5 fmol/cell in DMSO-treated
control cells (P < 0.02). As shown in Table 2A, the decrease
in PC levels in PI-103–treated cells was maintained for up
to 24 hours. PI-103 at 5× GI50 also caused a significant
time-dependent decrease in PE and NTP levels, but GPC
or GPE were not affected (Table 2A).
1
H-MR spectra of extracts of control and PI-103–treated
PC3 cells were also investigated (Fig. 1A). Concentrationresponse analysis showed a statistically significant concentration-dependent decrease in PC levels in PI-103–treated
PC3 cells compared with controls. As shown in Table 1,
changes in PC observed by 1H-MRS were similar to those detected by 31P-MRS. Furthermore, a concentration-dependent
decrease in the tCho (PC+ GPC+ choline) levels was also detected (Table 1). Table 2B shows the time-dependent changes
in PC and tCho levels following treatment with PI-103 detected by 1H-MRS. In PC3 cells, tCho levels are dominated
by the PC signal; hence, changes in tCho reflected those seen
in PC levels over the time course of treatment.
The PIK3CA mutant human colorectal cell line HCT116 was
treated with PI-103 for 24 hours at a pharmacologically active
concentration corresponding to 5× GI50 (GI50 = 1 μmol/L).
Analysis of 31P-MR spectra of control and PI-103–treated
HCT116 cells (Fig. 1B) showed that treatment for 24 hours
led to a 54 ± 8% (P = 0.01) decrease in PC levels relative to control, changing from 14.7 ± 1.2 fmol/cell in DMSO-treated control cells to 6.7 ± 0.7 fmol/cell (P = 0.004) following treatment.
Levels of NTP were not altered by PI-103, and GPC, GPE, and
PE signals were small and not accurately measurable. 1H-MRS

(Fig. 1B) showed a significant decrease in the levels of PC
(down to 52 ± 1%, P = 0.0005) as well as tCho (down to 62 ±
4%, P = 0.006). As shown in Fig. 1C, PI-103 caused similar effects on PC levels in HCT116 to those seen in PC3 cells.
Relationship of MRS changes with markers of PI3K
pathway inhibition
Similar to our previous results (20), 24-hour treatment
with PI-103 (5× GI50) resulted in a decrease in the number
of treated cells per flask compared with controls both in
PC3 cells (down to 83 ± 6%, P = 0.001) and HCT116 cells
(down to 69 ± 11%, P = 0.05), consistent with decreased proliferation. In PC3 cells, PI-103 caused both concentrationand time-dependent changes in cell number (Tables 1 and
2A). The decrease in PC levels was detectable using PI-103
for 24 hours at 1× GI50 (Table 1). Treatment at 5× GI50 did
not show reduced cell number for up to 12 hours, whereas
a significant decrease in PC levels was detected as early as
6 hours after PI-103 treatment (Table 2A and B).
Western blotting analysis of downstream components of
the PI3K pathway was performed. Using PC3 cells, PI-103
blocked PI3K signaling as indicated by decreases in pAKT
(Ser473) and pS6RP (Ser240/244) in treated compared with
control cells. This effect was observed at a PI-103 concentration of 1× GI50 (Supplementary Table S2A; Fig. 2A). At 5×
GI50, PI-103 decreased pAKT (Ser473) and pS6RP (Ser240/
244), which was detectable at 2 hours following treatment
and was sustained over the time course of treatment (Supplementary Table S2B; Fig. 2B). Overall, no effect on total
AKT or S6RP was detected, indicating that the effects seen
were on the phosphorylation of these proteins. Treatment
of HCT116 cells with PI-103 for 24 hours at 5× GI50 reduced
levels of pAKT (Ser473) and pS6RP (Ser240/244; Fig. 2C), confirming PI3K pathway inhibition in these cells. These results
showed that inhibition of the PI3K pathway was occurring at
PI-103 concentrations and time points that resulted in the
MRS changes reported above.
Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that 24-hour
treatment with PI-103 at 5× GI50 caused an increase in the G1
cell population and a decrease in S phase fraction in both cell
lines (Fig. 3A–C). In PC3 cells, cell cycle effects of PI-103 were

controls starting from 8 hours following treatment (Supplementary Table S3). Treatment of HCT116 cells with PI-103 reduced cell volume to 73 ± 4% (P = 0.01), relative to controls.
Normalizing to cell volume, PC levels in treated cells were still
decreased compared with control treatment (down to 63 ±
9%, P = 0.03).
To rule out nonspecific antiproliferative effects associated
with cytotoxicity, PC3 cells were also treated with the antimitotic agent docetaxel. Docetaxel was selected as this is used
clinically in prostate cancer patients (28). Treatment with
docetaxel at 5× GI50 (GI50 = 4.25 nmol/L) for 24 hours decreased cell number to 51 ± 6% (P = 0.001). In direct contrast
to the decrease observed with PI-103, 31P-MRS showed that
docetaxel increased concentrations of PC (up to 132 ± 12%,
P = 0.02), PE (up to 173 ± 23%, P = 0.01), GPC (up to 667 ±
98%, P = 0.002) and NTP (up to 175 ± 19%, P = 0.006).
Docetaxel acts through the inhibition of microtubular
depolymerization leading to the inhibition of mitosis and

both concentration- and time-dependent (Fig. 3A and B).
These data show that our MRS-detected PC changes occurred at low concentrations and preceded PI-103–mediated
cell cycle effects.
Mechanism for PC depletion
PI3K signaling is well known to regulate cell size (27). This
will have an effect on cellular metabolism and hence necessitates normalizing metabolite concentrations to cell volume.
We carried out cell volume measurements using flow
cytometry on cell samples used for MRS analysis, to determine whether cell volume changes caused by PI-103 contribute to our MRS-detected changes. In PC3 cells, PI-103 at 5×
GI50 caused a decrease in cell volume compared with controls
starting from 8 hours following treatment (Table 2A). After
normalization for cell volume, there is no significant effect
of PI-103 on PE or NTP (P > 0.1), but a significant average decrease of 30% (P < 0.05) in PC levels is still detected relative to

induction of apoptosis. In line with this, docetaxel-treated
cells were arrested in G2-M phase (from 19 ± 2% to 67 ± 4%,
P = 0.0001), resulting in an increase in average cell volume to
138 ± 11% (P = 0.01). Normalizing to cell volume, no change in
PC concentrations was detected compared with control, but
increases in PE (up to 126 ± 12%, P = 0.04), GPC (up to 487 ±
76%, P = 0.003), and NTP (up to 127 ± 10%, P = 0.02) were still
evident. An increase in choline-containing metabolites was also detected by 1H-MRS following treatment with docetaxel,
contrasting with the decrease caused by PI-103 (Fig. 4A).
Several reports have identified a link between the PI3K signaling pathway and enzymes involved in choline and lipid
metabolism including ChoK (29), FAS (30), and ACL (31).
Hence, the effect of PI-103 on the expression of these enzymes was determined to investigate potential mechanisms
underlying MRS-detected PC depletion. Western blotting of
cell extracts obtained from cells used for MRS analysis
showed that PI-103 caused a small decrease in the ACL phosphorylation (Ser454) in PC3 cells (Fig. 4B). The decrease in
pACL (Ser454) was maintained up to 24 hours posttreatment.
Quantification using densitometry showed a significant decrease in pACL (Ser454) levels reaching a minimum of 67 ±
14% (P = 0.03) in 6 hour–treated cells compared with control
cells (Supplementary Table S4). However, no correlation (r2 =
0.3, P = 0.2) was found between changes in the levels of PC
(measured by MRS) and pACL (Ser454; quantified by densitometry). A small statistically significant decrease (down to
84 ± 4%, P = 0.04) in FAS levels was seen only at 4 hours after
PI-103 treatment (Supplementary Table S4; Fig. 4B). Treatment of HCT116 cells with PI-103 at 5× GI50 for 24 hours also

5512

Cancer Res; 70(13) July 1, 2010

resulted in a decrease in pACL (Ser454; Fig. 2C) and FAS expression compared with controls. However, no correlation
was found between PC and pACL (r2 = 0.8, P = 0.1) or FAS
(r2 = 0.2, P = 0.5).
Levels of ChoKα were also analyzed by Western blotting,
using an antibody against human ChoKα (25). A decrease
in ChoKα expression was detectable from 4 hours following
treatment of PC3 cells with PI-103 at 5× GI 50 (Fig. 4B).
ChoKα levels, quantified by densitometry, decreased over
the time course of treatment reaching a minimum of 59 ±
13% (P = 0.01) in 16 hour–treated cells relative to control
(Supplementary Table S4; Fig. 4C). From 6 hours onwards,
a strong correlation was found between PC levels (measured
by MRS) and ChoKα levels (r2 = 0.9, P = 0.009; Fig. 4C). ChoKα
levels also decreased in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2C) and correlated
with the decrease in PC concentrations (r2 = 1, P = 0.02)
following PI-103 treatment.

Discussion
PI-103 is a potent inhibitor of class I PI3K and mTOR that
was synthesized following a high-throughput screen to identify inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of recombinant PI3K
p110α (13-17). Detailed pharmacologic characterization has
been carried out on PI-103 (17-20). PI-103 is widely used as
a chemical probe for the PI3K/mTOR pathway (17, 21) and
has inhibitory properties similar to several clinical candidates (32). Identification of noninvasive biomarkers of target
inhibition and potentially of tumor response to this novel
treatment would be of value in the clinical development of

MRS Biomarkers of PI3K Inhibition

PI3K inhibitors. In this study, we have used MRS to search for
potential noninvasive biomarkers of the effects of PI-103 in
two human cancer cell lines, PTEN null PC3 prostate and
PIK3CA mutant HCT116 colon, in vitro. Using 31P-MRS, a significant decrease in PC concentrations was detected in both
tumor lines following PI-103 treatment. A significant reduction in PE and NTP levels was also detected in the human
prostate cancer cell line PC3, but no effect on GPC or GPE
was observed. In the HCT116 colon cancer cells, NTP levels
were not affected by PI-103 treatment, whereas other phosphometabolites including PE, GPE, and GPC were below the
detection limit of our MR spectrometer.
We have previously reported a similar decrease in PC concentrations following the inhibition of PI3K signaling with
LY294002 and wortmannin (22). This indicates that the decrease in PC levels is likely to be related to the action of these
inhibitors and PI-103 on their common target PI3K, whereas
the increase in GPC observed following treatment with

LY294002 (22) may be related to other off-target effects of
this weakly potent and nonselective compound. It is important to note, however, that a decrease in PC concentrations
was also observed following inhibition of other signaling molecules, for example: mitogen-activated protein kinase (33),
FAS (34), HIF-1α (35), and phospholipase Cγ1 (36). Although
this might suggest that these changes may not be specific to
the PI3K pathway, we have shown that they are different
from those seen with, for example, inhibitors of HSP90 (23)
and HDAC (37, 38). Furthermore, assessing the effect of
the antimitotic agent docetaxel, we detected a decrease in
cell number but an increase in PE and GPC levels. This
further supports the view that our MRS-detected changes
are a consequence of the inhibition of cell signaling and
not simply a nonspecific antiproliferative effects associated
with cytotoxicity.
Although changes in PC and/or tCho may not be specific to
drugs acting on a particular molecular target or pathway, they

can nevertheless provide valuable biomarkers of response
(11). Many biomarkers are not specific to a given pathway,
but nevertheless have considerable clinical value (e.g., [18F]2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose). Significant PC changes have been
observed at 1× GI 50 concentrations of PI-103, which are
achieved in animal studies (20). Furthermore, preliminary
evidence suggests that PI3K inhibitors with improved pharmaceutical properties compared with PI-103 also show simi-

lar effects (data not shown). We have demonstrated that we
can measure choline-containing metabolites in spectra from
tumors from patients in the clinic (2, 39). Based on our observation that changes in these metabolites parallel target inhibition in cells, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that our
findings reported herein may have the potential to translate
to animal and human studies.
Using 1H-MRS, we were able to detect a similar decrease in
PC levels to those measured by 31P-MRS in PC3 and HCT116
cells following treatment with PI-103. More importantly, the
composite tCho peak decreased significantly, indicating that
the effect of PI-103 can be followed in vivo despite the overlap of the choline-containing metabolite peaks in 1H-MR
spectra. This increases the potential for the translation of
our work into the clinic as 1H-MRS can be performed on
many current clinical MRS systems, in contrast to 31P-MRS,
which requires specialized hardware. 1H-MRS also has the
advantage of higher sensitivity compared with 31P-MRS, thus
reducing measurement times.
The antiproliferative effects of PI-103 were previously investigated using a panel of human cancer cell lines with an
activated PI3K pathway caused by different genetic abnormalities (20). Using the PTEN null PC3 cells, PI-103 was
found to be ∼50-fold more potent than the commonly used
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (20). Similarly, our results show that
a low concentration of PI-103 equal to 1× GI50 was sufficient
to significantly decrease PC levels, whereas LY294002 required a ∼50-fold higher concentration to cause a similar
decrease in PC levels in the human breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-231 (22). PI-103 showed a concentration-dependent effect on cell proliferation and G1 cell cycle arrest as
well as the decrease in PC levels. PI-103 treatment for 24
hours at 1× GI50 resulted in a significant reduction in PC
detected by MRS, which was associated with pAKT depletion. Higher concentrations of PI-103 were required to affect
cell number and cell cycle. Furthermore, a time-dependent
decrease in PC levels starting from 6 hours following treatment with PI-103 (5× GI50) was observed. This was associated with a reduction in pAKT but preceded G 1 cell cycle
arrest and reduction of cell number. These results further
confirm that the decrease in PC levels is related to the inhibition of PI3K signaling, rather than being a consequence of
the effect of PI-103 on cell growth. Thus, MRS-detected PC
may represent a sensitive and early pharmacodynamic biomarker for response to PI3K inhibition.
PC plays important roles in lipid biosynthesis and cell signaling (40). The concentration of PC in cells is, therefore,
likely to result from an interplay between both metabolic
and signaling networks. Aberrant choline metabolism has
been shown in cancer cells in culture in which elevated choline levels may be indicative of membrane turnover (40), increased malignant potential, or upregulation of signaling
processes due to oncogenic activation events (41, 42).
In the present study, we have investigated possible mechanisms underlying MR-detectable metabolic changes
with the focus on the decrease in PC levels. The aim was
to establish the link between PI3K signaling and phospholipid metabolism and, in turn, to help optimize the use of

MRS Biomarkers of PI3K Inhibition

MRS-detectable changes as potential biomarkers for inhibitors of this pathway.
First, we have investigated the decrease in cell size following PI3K/mTOR inhibition as a possible cause for the
reduction in MRS-detectable lipid biosynthesis. An enhanced lipid synthesis following AKT activation was previously reported, attributed to the acceleration of the de novo
membrane synthesis required to allow the increased cell
volume (31, 43). In line with this report, inhibition of the
PI3K pathway using PI-103 resulted in a significant decrease
in treated PC3 and HCT116 cell volume compared with
controls. However, this reduction in cell volume was not
enough to explain the decrease in PC levels detected by
MRS in our system.
Second, we ruled out the possibility that the decrease in
PC levels was due to nonspecific effects associated with cytotoxicity by comparing MRS-detected changes in PC3 cells
with the effects of the clinically relevant microtubule inhibitor docetaxel. Treatment with this antimitotic agent caused a
decrease in cell number but had no significant effect on PC
levels. We have previously reported similar results using
doxorubicin (23). Further work could be performed with other cytotoxics in the future.
Finally, the effects of PI-103 on enzymes involved in lipid
metabolism were explored. As discussed in our previous report (22) and references therein, oncogene- and/or mitogen
signal transduction effectors are known to modulate many
phosphatidylcholine-specific enzymes. More specifically, the
PI3K pathway has been shown to regulate ChoK, the enzyme
responsible for phosphorylation of choline into PC (29). Furthermore, activation of AKT has been shown to induce expression of FAS and ACL, enzymes catalyzing the de novo
synthesis of long-chain fatty acids, thus increasing membrane lipid biosynthesis (31, 43, 44). Hence, we hypothesized
that modulation of the PI3K pathway using PI-103 would affect these enzymes and thus modulate choline metabolism,
leading to the changes we detected by MRS. Our results
showed a consistent decrease in ChoKα protein expression
following treatment with PI-103 in both cell lines. Furthermore, a strong correlation between the decrease in PC levels
detected by MRS and ChoKα expression was observed in the
human prostate carcinoma cell line PC3 following treatment
with PI-103. In contrast, our results showed no obvious relationship between the reduction in PC levels and FAS or pACL
protein expression. This indicates that the decrease in ChoKα
protein expression induced by PI-103 plays a major role in
the MRS-detected PC depletion that we detected in our study.
It is important to note that the involvement of other
enzymes related to choline metabolism, such as phospholipases D, C, and A2 (45, 46) as well as choline transporters
(47), cannot be excluded. Further work is required to identify whether these enzymes are also involved in MRS
changes detected following PI3K inhibition. We have previously published a genome-wide cDNA microarray profiling
study of mRNAs that show altered expression in response
to PI-103 in the PTEN null human glioblastoma cells (Supplementary data published therein; ref. 19). Inspection of
the data shows changes in the expression of genes involved

in glucose and cholesterol biosynthesis. Thus, further studies of pathways involved in tumor metabolism should be
carried out in the future.
Taken together, our results strongly support a link between ChoKα and its product PC, and the PI3K signaling
pathway. Because ChoKα protein levels are decreased, one
possibility is that ChoKα could be regulated downstream of
mTOR (48). However, GSK-3 could also play a role in lipid
metabolism control through ACL (49). Inhibitors that act at
the different key components in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR network (32) could be used to further clarify the association
between MR-detectable metabolic changes and the PI3K
signaling pathway.
In conclusion, our study has shown that MRS can be
used to detect a decrease in PC and tCho levels that is
associated with the inhibition of PI3K by the class I PI3K
and mTOR inhibitor PI-103 in human prostate and colon
carcinoma cell lines. We have also identified inhibition of
ChoKα as a factor involved in the observed decrease in
PC levels following treatment with PI-103. Monitoring the
changes in PC and tCho levels by MRS (using either 1H
or 31P) may provide noninvasive pharmacodynamic biomarkers of PI3K pathway inhibition and potentially of tumor
response in solid tumors during clinical trials with novel
PI3K inhibitors.
