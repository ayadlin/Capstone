Abstract
Optimal delivery of chemotherapy intensity is dependent on
host- and tumor-specific characteristics. In this article, the
chemotherapy late intensity schedule is revised to account
for tumor growth instability, where a small tumor cell fraction
emerges that exhibits a higher proliferation rate than the
parent strain. Modeling this instability as simplified twopopulation dynamics, we find that: (a) if this instability
precedes the onset of treatment, the slope of the linear increase of the drug concentration for the standard “NortonSimon late intensity schedule” changes and the initial value
of the dose strongly depends on the ratio of the two tumor cell
populations and on their distinct growth rates; and (b) if the
instability trails the initial treatment, the effective chemotherapeutic drug concentration changes as well. Both cases point
toward testable potential refinements of the Norton-Simon
late intensity schedule. [Cancer Res 2009;69(21):8507–15]
Major Findings
To investigate the influence of cancer heterogeneity
on treatment impact, we study the case of an initially
monoclonal tumor in which, at a given time, a secondary,
faster replicating strain emerges from the parent tumor
cell population. These “two-population dynamics” result
in growth instability that impacts the current standard
chemotherapeutic schedule for both situations, i.e., if the
instability arises prior to or after the start of a nonspecific
drug regimen. In both cases, the chemotherapeutic dose
depends strongly on the balance of the two populations
and on their specific growth rates, and consequently requires a nonlinear time modulation of the dose concentration of the “Norton-Simon late intensity” schedule. By
comparing the model with available clinical data, it
proved capable of predicting the different therapeutic response of breast cancers exhibiting an estrogen receptor
(ER) positive subpopulation.

Introduction
Cancer therapy is aimed at targeting specific tumor (re)growth
patterns to inhibit, or at least control, local tumor proliferation and
metastatic dissemination. Mathematical modeling provides a
promising tool by which to shed light onto these growth dynamics

from a theoretical perspective, using both experimental and clinical data as input. Such works range from investigating various
forms of exponential growth kinetics, e.g., (1, 2) to that of describing a Universal growth law (3), with intriguing implications of the
latter to radiotherapy (4). For cytotoxic chemotherapy, a welldocumented case in which theoretical reasoning had an impact
on the therapeutic approach is that of breast cancer where, following the “Norton-Simon” hypothesis (5), standard treatment has
been adjusted to a “dose dense” regimen; that is, the agent is given
at a greater dose rate (i.e., multiple pulses of chemotherapy) to optimize efficacy, and to keep toxic side effects comparatively low.
The underlying hypothesis is that, compared with the host organ,
cancerous tissue exhibits a denser structure with higher fractal
mass dimension, and is composed of smaller, relatively faster growing subseeds, all of which follow the Gompertz law (GL). Differing
from the traditional “log-kill” concept (6), Norton and Simon then
argued, based on a body of experimental and clinical studies on solid cancers, that “therapy results in a rate of regression proportional
to the growth rate of an unperturbed neoplasm of that size” (7, 8).
This hypothesis has been tested in a phase III clinical study
led by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 97-41;8 ref. 9).
This large prospective randomized trial showed that shortening
the time interval between each chemotherapy cycle while maintaining the same dose size resulted in significant improvements in disease-free and overall survival in patients with node-positive breast
carcinoma. More recently, also a phase I study in patients with metastatic breast cancer confirmed the therapeutic results predicted
by the Norton-Simon model (10). However, within the framework of
the Norton-Simon model, the issue of drug resistance is only considered at the qualitative level, contrary to some leading work addressing this issue performed by Goldie and Coldman (11, 12). In a
more recent theoretical work, Coldman and Murray (13) investigated a stochastic model of non–cell cycle phase–specific cancer chemotherapy for exponentially growing tumors including the
development of drug resistance and the effect of chemotherapy
on normal cells. The authors concluded that early intensification,
a feature shared with the Norton Simon model, is a common aspect
of successful regimes where drug resistance is likely. We note that
the role of intratumor heterogeneity and its implications for the
evolution of drug resistance and cell kinetics has already been considered by Gardner (14), who proposed a kinetically tailored treatment (KITT model). Finally, Monro and Gaffney (15) recently
proposed a model aiming at a unifying description based on wellfounded approximations, i.e., Gompertzian tumor growth, log cell
kill by chemotherapy, and Luria-Delbruck mutation to resistance
[this assumption was based on the Nobel Prize winning work of

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Equation11::
Equation

1 dN
¼ αðt Þ−C ðt Þ
N dt

This equation describes the “macroscopic” growth law for a cancer cell population under the effect of
chemotherapy. N(t) is the cell number at time t, α(t) is the specific growth rate, and C(t) represents the
effect (per cell) of a drug concentration. The specific growth rate can be written, in general, as a nonlinear
function of N and, in particular, for the Gompertz growth α(t) = K ln (N∞/N) where N∞ is the asymptotic
value of the cell number and K a constant. If N is a population composed of n subpopulations, each proliferating with a different specific growth rate and drug response function, the whole growth behavior and
the chemotherapy results are different from the usual calculations based on a single Gompertzian dynamic. Within a simplified two-population model, it is then possible to evaluate the effects of tumor growth
instability [where a small tumor cell fraction, N2 (t), emerges that exhibits a higher proliferation rate than
the parent strain, N1 (t)] on chemotherapeutic results.
Major assumptions: A cycle-nonspecific drug response function is considered in Eq. (1) and in the
corresponding equations (A.2.1 and A.2.2) for populations N1 (t), N2 (t).

Equation22::
Equation

Ni ðtÞ ¼ Ni ðt*Þexpð−ωi ðtÞðt−t*ÞÞ

Chemotherapeutic effects are described by a decrease in tumor cell (sub)population(s); in the previous equation, Ni(t*)is the cell (sub) population(s) at the onset of treatment and ωi(t) the corresponding
rate of cell reduction. For a single Gompertzian growth, if ω(t) is constant, one obtains the SimonNorton late intensity schedule, i.e., C(t) turns out (see Eq. 4) as a linear function of time. In other words,
the requirement that the drug therapy reduces exponentially—with a constant rate—the tumor cell
number implies, through Eq. 1, a linear increase of drug concentration. One can therefore evaluate
how this behavior changes with tumor instability.
Major assumption: A constant ω(t) is, in general, an oversimplifying approximation if there are subpopulations with a different response to the drug therapy (see the next equation).



Equation
Equation 33::


1−expð−K ðt−t*ÞÞ
ω2 ðt Þ ¼ ω1 −β
K ðt−t*Þ

By imposing that, due to chemotherapy, the subpopulation N1 (t) exponentially decreases with a constant rate ω1, whereas the subpopulation N2 (t) follows a time-dependent rate ω2(t) one obtains a differential equation for ω2(t). The previous equation is the solution of the differential equation with the
boundary condition ω2(t*) = ω1 − β [with β in equation (B.7)].
The solution of the equation for ω2(t) allows comparing the predicted evolution of the two different
populations with experimental data.
Major assumption: by solving the equation, one obtains ω2(t) if ω1(t) is known, evaluating how the drug
dose induces different reductions of the two subpopulations. The choice ω1 = constant has been made to
simplify the calculations.
Equations 4 and 5: By imposing the exponential behavior in previous Eq. 2, the Gompertzianspecific rate αi(t) depends on the corresponding rates ωi(t). At least for short time, intervals after the
end of chemotherapy, te, the patient's survival probability, Pi(t), should be proportional to the cell population regrowth rate at the end of the therapy: that is, a larger regrowth rate corresponds to smaller survival probability. Therefore one can write

the different growth rate (both
before and after therapy) that
represents intrinsic tumor
heterogeneity.
Here, we present evidence
that cancer's inherent clonal
diversity results in nonhomogenous growth patterns,
which in turn—even for its
simplest form of two-population
dynamics—will require a modification of the “late intensifica tio n sche du le ” th at ha s
been put forward by NortonSimon (17). The next section
introduces the underlying
growth instability model and
its relevance for the current
standard schedule for both situations, i.e., if the instability
arises prior or after the regimen. We also propose an approach more closely related to
clinical therapy and compare
the results with data on survival probability.

Materials and Methods
Let us first recall that for a(n
idealized) homogeneous tumor
system, the general growth law
can be written as

where N is the number of individual cancer cells at time t and α
is their specific growth rate (for a

the saturation value of the cell number N(t → ∞) = N ∞ given by
N ∞ ¼ N1∞ þ N2∞ , and according to previous equations (A.0.2–A.0.3), differ-

of the choices of the parameter values, various configurations will be

specific growth rates. Fig. 1A and B show the results for breast cancer
with an asymptotic mass M∞ = 640 grams (the mass is assumed to be
proportional to the cell number N) and an initial mass of M(0) = 6.4
grams. The delay tδ equals 100 days in Fig. 1A and 500 days in Fig. 1B.
The corresponding GL for a homogeneous cell population with the same
initial and final mass is also plotted.
2. Let us now consider another case, in which the second cell population
develops with the same delay of 500 days, but its specific replication rate
(leading to a different fraction of the final tumor mass) is modified. In
both cases, N2 grows more rapidly than N1, which is obtained by imposing N1∞ < N2∞ . In Fig. 2A the result for M1∞ ¼ 0:4M ∞ and M2∞ ¼
0:6M ∞ is depicted, whereas Fig. 2B shows the plot for M1∞ ¼ 0:2M ∞
and M2∞ ¼ 0:8M ∞ , respectively.
3. Let us now clarify the effects of the size of the subsystem N2 on tumor
growth, at time delay tδ, with respect to the subsystem N1. If the subclone
N2 contributes substantially to N∞, its specific proliferation rate must
strongly increase to reach a predefined fraction of the total final tumor
mass, and such an increase is much larger depending on how, at tδ its
size compares to N1 (tδ).

In Fig. 3A, we show, for the same set of parameters used in Fig. 2A, the
dramatic impact of the unstable cancer system when N2 (tδ) is 10−6 smaller
than N1 (tδ), for tδ = 500 days. The effect of increasing the delay time is
shown in Fig. 3B by considering the same set of values of the parameter
as in Fig. 3A and tδ = 1,000 days. Let us note that a similar analysis can be
performed easily with other growth laws, for example the Universal law
proposed by West and colleagues (19, 20). The results are expected to be
qualitatively the same as those obtained using the GL, which is appropriately used here to relate the effects of tumor instability to chemotherapy
regimen that still rely on GL.
To investigate the potential effects of such tumor instability on treatment, let us consider the “Norton-Simon” hypothesis with regards to its
“late intensity” schedule for chemotherapy. Considering a monoclonal
cell population that grows according to Eq. 1, and assuming that the
dose-response per cell to a nonspecific chemotherapeutic cycle can

be described by a function C(t), the time evolution of the system is given
by the following equation:
1 dN
¼ αðt Þ−C ðt Þ
N dt

ð3Þ

That means, the tumor stops growing, and eventually regresses, when
the therapeutic dose, delivered at time t*, is larger than a critical value
given by C > Ccr = α (t*). Moreover, assuming that, due to therapeutic
impact, the cancer cell number decreases exponentially with a rate ω,
then N(t) = N(t*)exp [-ω (t - t*)] and one obtains (see Appendix A.1) that
C(t), in the case of Gompertzian growth rate, is a linearly increasing function of time:
C g ðtÞ ¼ A þ Bðt−t*Þ

N
where A ¼ ω þ K g ln
and B = ω Kg

∞

Therefore a linear increase of the chemotherapeutic drug dose with time
can reduce the number of tumor cells exponentially. However, chemotherapeutic treatments based on the previous considerations assume single
population dynamics.
Indeed, if one considers even the simplest case of heterogeneity, i.e.,
g
g
a system of two subpopulations with in general K1 ≠K2 , because N(t) =
N 1 (t) + N 2 (t), the exponential decrease gives N(t) = N 1 (t*)exp (-ω
(t - t*)) + N2 (t*)exp (-ω (t - t*)) and cancer populations N1 and N2 follow
Gompertzian growth kinetics with the corresponding specific rates (see
Eqs. A.2.1 and A.2.2) and drug concentrations.
We will now discuss which modification of the “late intensity schedule”
can be relevant for an unstable, i.e., heterogeneous tumor exemplified by
two-population dynamics according to the previous equations (for mathematical details see Appendix A.2).
Onset of tumor instability after the beginning of chemotherapy. Let
us first assume that tumor instability starts after the beginning of the
therapy treatment, i.e., tδ > t*. In this case, for t* < t < tδ, the time evolution is due to population N1 (t) only and the corresponding drug conceng
tration for a late intensity schedule, CI (t), is given by Eq. 4 with K1 ¼ K g .

populations is 500 d (A) and 2,000 d (B). The other parameter values are M∞ = 640 g, M(0) = 6.4 g, M21 (tδ) = M1 (tδ) 10−6, and M1∞ = 0.4M∞.

Results
Using the model described above, we now evaluate its effects on
chemotherapeutic treatment (and thus its predictive power) by using medical data on breast cancer survival probability.
The ratio D ¼ CC in Eqs. 4 and 5 describes the effects of the drug
therapy with respect to the single Gompertzian growth when tumor instability starts after the beginning of the therapy, i.e., tδ > t*.
For t* < t < tδ, this ratio is 1 and therefore one can set t* = 0. In
Fig. 4, DII is plotted for tδ = 60 days and for ω = 0.1 per month;
different values of KK are considered. For a one-population Gompertzian growth, of course, DII = 1. With this set of parameters,
DII changes <10%. Notice that, when KK ¼ 1:5, the value of DII can be
less than one for some time intervals. This is due to the fact that
at the onset of instability the total tumor mass splits in two subpopulations with different specific proliferation rates but also
with different cell numbers at tδ. Therefore, a depletion of the
large population N 1 (tδ ) occurs and it requires some time for
the growing instability, N2, to compensate this initial negative
step. Then, ratio D ¼ CðtÞ
C t in Eqs. 4 and 6 (which is, by definition,
equal to 1 for t < tδ) describes the effects for onset of tumor instability before the beginning of chemotherapy. D strongly depends on the specific proliferation rates of the two populations
and on their relative fraction of the total cancer cell population
at the onset of instability and the time of treatment. In Fig. 5A,
the ratio D is plotted as a function of time for t* = 365 days and
for tδ = 100 days, for different values of KK .
In Fig. 5B, D is plotted for the same tδ and t* values, and for the
N
same ratios KK , but changing the relative population N21 at the onset
of instability and at saturation (i.e., when t → ∞). Depending on the
value of KK , the ratio D increases from 20% to 70% (see figure captions for details).
We note that the values of the ratios D and DII depend on many
parameters, which should be properly taken into account in a clinical context. On the other hand, the presence of instabilities, both
before and after the time at which the therapy has been administrated, postulates further improvements of the Norton-Simon late
intensity schedule. For this reason, in the previous section, a more
general approach with different rates of regression for populations
N1 and N2 (ω1 ≠ ω2) has been also considered. It can be applied to
more realistic clinical cases. For example, it is well known that primary breast cancer cells can express a variety of surface receptors,
a fact that correlates with clinical outcome. In particular, during
their proliferative activity, breast cancer cell populations may start
expressing receptors for hormones, mainly for estrogens and progesterone (21, 22). Let us then denote, in a breast cancer, the original cell population N1, which fails to express estrogen receptor, as
ER−, and the population N2, which starts to express such receptors,
as ER+. To be able to compare our model with clinical data, one
has to relate the survival probability of a patient at time t, P(t),
after the end of chemotherapy (which occurred at time te), assuming a survival tumor cell fraction (at time te) computed according
to the exponential decrease, i.e., with
ω1= const and ω2 (t) in Eq. 7,

in which t* = 0. Therefore, α ¼ K ln NNð0Þ þ ω Kt , α ¼ K ln NNð0Þ þ ω Kt (see
Appendix B) and through a simple calculation α2 (te) = α1 (te) +
β exp (-Kte).

NOTE: The experimental error is not included.

On the other hand, for a “one-population Gompertzian growth”, with
saturation N∞, Cg is given by Eq. 4 for t* = tδ.
Onset of tumor instability before the beginning of chemotherapy.
Let us now assume that t* > tδ, i.e., the treatment (delivered at time t*) follows the onset of instability (at time tδ). Accordingly, the tumor grows following the “one-population GL” up until time tδ [N(t) = N1 (t) for t < tδ] when
the population N2 (t) emerges with a different specific proliferation rate.
Through Eq. A.2.5 in Appendix A, the drug concentration for t < t* turns
out to be
CðtÞ ¼ A2p þ !B2p ðt  t
 Þ

ð6Þ

where A2P and B2P are given in Eq. A.2.8 and A.2.9.
The role of tumor instability is crucial for the time behavior of the drug
concentration because it determines different populations, N1 (t*) and N2 (t*)
at time t*, and different slopes in the linear time dependence of CðtÞ.
In fact, during the interval tδ < t < t*, the two populations, N1 and N 2 ,
follow a Gompertzian growth with different specific rates. As we shall see
in the next section, the presence of instabilities, both before and after the time
at which the therapy has been administrated, postulates further improvements of the “Norton-Simon late intensity” schedule based on an uniform rate
of regression, ω, of the number of cells according to N(t) = N(t*)exp [-ω (t - t*)].
The previous equations (Eqs. 4, 5, and 6) show that, for the two population
dynamics following Gompertzian growth, the average drug concentration
required to obtain such a result is different from the drug concentration for
a single tumor population exhibiting Gompertzian growth dynamics.
Different drug effectiveness against cancer clones. The previous general result is obtained by mimicking the differential response of the two cancer cell populations to the different drug concentrations C1 and C2 and the
same ω. However, one can consider another approach to the problem that
could, to some extent, be closer to the real setting, where a “cocktail” of
drugs is given, which are expected to be effective against a particular tumor
on the basis of previous empirical data. Indeed, in the therapy modeled according to the previous treatment, one expects that the drug concentration
is uniformly delivered among cells and that C1 = C2 = C but the “differential”
effectiveness against a cancerous clones, i.e., the reduction (for unit time) of
cancer cells in the two populations, is translated in a different rate of regression for populations N1 and N2, which is ω1 ≠ ω2.
To be more precise, let us consider the growth Eqs. A.2.1 and A.2.2 with
C1 (t) = C2 (t) = C (t) and let us assume that, after time t* at which the
treatment started, the therapeutic result is N1 (t) = N1 (t*)exp (-ω1 (t t*)) and N2 (t) = N2 (t*)exp (-ω2 (t - t*)); in this discussion, the delay time,
tδ, is neglected but it can be easily included.
It turns out (see Appendix B) that the requirement that the same dose C
(t) reduces the two populations with different rates cannot be satisfied except when some reduction rate is assumed to be time dependent. This implies that the effect of the drug concentration on population N 2 , for
example, must be modified with a time dependent ω2, i.e., N2 (t) = N2
(t*)exp (-ω2 (t) (t - t*)), which, for ω1 = const, is given by (see Appendix B)

Tumor Instability and Chemotherapy

At least for short time intervals after the end of chemotherapy, the
patient survival probability should be proportional to the regrowth
rate at the end of the therapy: that is, a larger regrowth rate corresponds to a smaller survival probability. Therefore, one can write
Pi ðtÞ ¼ 1−αi ðte Þðt−te Þ

ð8Þ

For not too large t - te, the value of parameter α1 can be fitted by
approximating the curve ER− (ER/PgR absent) in Fig. 1 of Colleoni
and colleagues (23). This gives α1 ∼0.071 per year. To evaluate the
survival probability with ER+, we use the corresponding formula
with α2 (te) (note that a different te is simply a rescaling of β).
By comparison with the corresponding clinical data, the parameter
β can be estimated by trial and error methods and turns out to be
β ∼ 0.08 per year in the time range of 1 to 4 years. On the basis of
such values, the survival probabilities can be estimated and
the comparison with the corresponding clinical data are given in
Table 1. These results are in good agreement with the clinical data
reported in (23) for the curve ER+ (ER/PgR present) and suggest a
generalization of Eq. 8 in exponential form,
Pi ðtÞ ¼ exp½−αi ðt−te Þ

ð9Þ

which gives the results reported in Table 1 by using β ∼ 0.13 per
year. One should note that the previous comparisons have been
done by considering ω1 time independent and without any optimization of the parameter β. This preliminary analysis does not
show the saturation of the patient survival probability observed
at long time intervals; however, it suggests a simple relationship
between the drug dose required to obtain a given regression rate
and the survival probability of the patient, which could be generalized in analogy to the so-called “linear-quadratic model” used
in radiotherapy. We shall discuss this point in detail in a forthcoming article.

vals: formally, the difference in specific growth is related to the
saturation value of the cell number, N ðt→∞Þ ¼ N ∞ ¼ N1∞ þ N2∞ . Be∞
cause the maximum number of individuals is N∞, the ratio NN1∞ and
2
the delay in the onset of growth between the two subpopulations
results in different specific growth rates, a variety of distinct realistic situations can be described without necessity of other “ad hoc”
assumptions. For instance, the occurrence of “dormancy” phases
during tumor development [which has been simulated by Speer
and colleagues (25), assuming that some parameters that describe
the overall Gompertzian growth may experience stepwise variations, which in turn are responsible for the appearance of “plateaus”
in the tumor growth curve] may be generated by proper choices
of the delay time tδ (see Fig. 3B). We also investigated how the
conventional “late-intensity” chemotherapy schedule proposed by
Norton and Simon, based on the underlying assumption of singlepopulation dynamics (with the parameters of a unique homogeneous Gompertzian growth), has to be modified when tumor
time evolution is non uniform. We showed that in both case,
i.e., if the instability starts before or after the onset of treatment
the chemotherapeutic dose strongly depends on the balance of
the two populations and on their specific growth rates.
Finally, by introducing a drug concentration nonlinear in time, the
model was evaluated with some available clinical data, comparing
its predictions for the subpopulation ER+ that emerges from the
original breast cancer cells. Comparing the predicted survival probability following therapy, we conclude that the model is capable to
prefigure the different responses on the basis of a small number of
parameters, whose values can be easily fitted from clinical data.
Most importantly, our simplified analysis indicates already that a
global, average chemotherapeutic approach will not be successful
if growth instabilities were to occur. It further argues that a better
phenomenological and theoretical understanding of such therapeutic effects requires a more accurate description of these instabilities.

Discussion
In here, we propose a model aimed at gaining more insights into
how tumors respond to chemotherapy, taking into account some
features that are normally disregarded. In particular:
1. the well-known cancer characteristic of clonal heterogeneity
and the growth instability it produces;
2. the analysis of the effects of such instabilities when occurring
before and after the administration of chemotherapy;
3. their potential impact on the overall survival probability of the
patient.

Although our method holds, in principle, also for the more realistic polyclonal tumors, for simplicity, we specifically investigated
the case of an initially monoclonal tumor in which, at time tδ, a
secondary, faster replicating strain emerges from the parent tumor
cell population. The resulting two-population dynamics are described in a way that is somewhat different from the usual interspecific competition of the two populations for survival and access to
resources (prey-predator model, see, for example ref. 24) because
the details about the dynamic evolution of the two distinct populations in the tumor required by such a more traditional approach
would be unavailable, at least until the tumor is surgically approached and a biopsy taken for histologic evaluation. In our case,
therefore, the competition
between the two cell populations is eng
coded in the ratio KK2g and in the boundary condition for long inter-

From Eqs. A.0.2 and A.0.3 and Eqs. A.2.1 and A.2.2 with C1(t) = C2

Eq. B.3 cannot be satisfied relaxing the requirement that the reduction rate is time independent, except one allows for some reduction
rate to become time dependent. This implies that the exponential
decrease for the effect of the drug concentration on population N2,
for example, must be modified with a time dependent ω2, i.e.,
N2 ðtÞ ¼ N2 ðt*Þexpð−ω2 ðtÞðt−t*ÞÞ

And through substitution of C 1 and C 2 in Eq. A.2.5 and by
taking into account that N (t) = N 1 (t*) exp (-ω (t-t*)) + N 2 (t*)
exp (-ω (t-t*)), one obtains Eq. 6 with
