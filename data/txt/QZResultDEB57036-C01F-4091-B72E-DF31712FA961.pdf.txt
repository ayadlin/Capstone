ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) are highly malignant and aggressive tumors
lack of effective therapeutic drugs. Piperlongumine (PL), a natural product isolated
from longer pepper plants, is recently identified as a potent cytotoxic compound
highly selective to cancer cells. Here, we reported that PL specifically suppressed
HCC cell migration/invasion via endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-MAPKs-CHOP signaling
pathway. PL selectively killed HCC cells but not normal hepatocytes with an IC50 of
10-20 µM while PL at much lower concentrations only suppressed HCC cell migration/
invasion. PL selectively elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HCC cells, which
activated or up-regulated downstream PERK/Ire 1α/Grp78, p38/JNK/Erk and CHOP
subsequently. Administration of antioxidants completely abolished PL’s effects on
cell death and migration/invasion. However, pharmacological inhibition of ER stressresponses or MAPKs signaling pathways with corresponding specific inhibitors only
reversed PL’s effect on cell migration/invasion but not on cell death. Consistently,
knocking-down of CHOP by RNA interference only reversed PL-suppressed HCC cell
migration. Finally, PL significantly suppressed HCC development and activated the
ER-MAPKs-CHOP signaling pathway in HCC xenografts in vivo. Taken together, PL
selectively killed HCC cells and preferentially inhibited HCC cell migration/invasion
via ROS-ER-MAPKs-CHOP axis, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for the highly
malignant and aggressive HCC clinically.

INTRODUCTION

two-edge sword in tumorigenesis and development. At
the initial stage in HCC development, ROS or oxidative
stress-responses mainly stimulate hepatocarcinogenesis or
promote HCC development by activating pro-oncogenic
gene activities or oncogenic signaling pathways such as
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [3,4]. Along
with the progression of HCC, ROS overproduction or longlasting oxidative stress-responses would tend to induce
cell death or prevent cancer development in HCC [1, 5].
Therefore, modulating homeostasis of ROS or oxidative

Liver cancers are highly malignant and aggressive
tumors, making it the third leading cause of cancer death
in the world [1]. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the
most common type of liver malignant tumors in adults.
HCC usually occurs following a viral hepatitis infection
(hepatitis B or C) or cirrhosis, in which complicated
pathological processes induced by reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are heavily involved [2]. ROS is considered as a

stress-responses has become an important therapeutic
strategy for HCC [5, 6]. Accumulative evidences support
that oxidants have therapeutic effects in cancer treatment
and the underlying mechanisms have been well studied
[5, 7-11]. It is well-known that ROS may alter various
cellular signaling pathways profoundly depending on
different cellular contexts and MAPKs (i.e., p38, JNK and
Erk) are canonical ROS-responsive signaling pathways [812].Until now, the exact mechanisms of oxidative stressresponses in HCC development and treatment remain far
from clear.
Piperlongumine (PL) is a biological active alkaloid
existing largely in the long pepper (Piper longum L). PL
has been traditionally used for treating gastrointestinal and
respiratory diseases in Ayurvedic medicine [12]. Recently,
PL was identified as a highly reliable and potent cytotoxic
compound in killing cancer cells in screening study [13].
PL selectively kills cancer cells but leave normal cell
intact as PL induces ROS accumulation only in cancer
cells [8, 9, 13]. The PL induced selective accumulation of
ROS in cancer cells represents a novel therapeutic strategy
for cancers [8, 9, 13, 14]. It is reported that PL might exert
its cytotoxicity by activating p38 [9,11], JNK [9], Erk
[15], Akt [16, 17], promoting protein glutathionylation
[18], or suppressing NFκB activities [19] in different types
of cancer cells. Further exploring the anticancer effects as
well as its underlying mechanisms of PL is required for its
clinical applications.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a specific organelle
for Ca2+ storage and proper protein folding/maturation,
plays an important role in regulating ROS homeostasis
and stress-responses [20]. Upon various pathological
stimuli such as ROS or misfolded/unfolded proteins
accumulation, ER homeostasis is disturbed and ER
stress-responses are induced, leading to the activation of
various downstream signaling pathways such as MAPKs
and the induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)
[21, 22]. Consequently, stressed cells may either restore
its homeostasis or undergo programmed cell death such
as apoptosis or autophage [23]. In various cancer cells
including HCC cells, enhanced ER stress-responses have
been well documented [24-26]. However, the effects of
ER stress-responses (either promoting or inhibiting cancer
development) vary depending on specific ER-downstream
signaling pathways in specific cellular contexts [24, 27].
Considering the central role of ER in oxidative stressresponses in HCC, it is likely that ER-mediated stressresponses and its downstream signaling pathways might
be heavily involved in PL’s biological effects in HCC
cells.
In the present study, we examined the anticancer
effects of PL on HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, and
further investigated the underlying mechanisms. Our data
demonstrated that PL preferentially suppressed HCC cell
migration and invasion via ER-MAPKs-CHOP depending
on ROS.

Piperlongumine selectively kills HCC cells but not
normal hepatocytes
We tested the cytotoxic effects of PL in human
HCC cell lines to evaluate the therapeutic potential
of PL for HCC. MTT assays demonstrated that 24 h of
PL treatment induced a significant reduction in the cell
viability of various HCC cells (HepG2, Huh7, LM3) in a
concentration-dependent manner (PL 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20
µM), but had little effect in that of primary rat hepatocytes
and normal hepatic L-02 cells (Fig. 1A). The half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PL in HCC cells was in
the range of 10-20 µΜ. Trypan blue assay showed that the
rate of cell death was significantly increased in HepG2,
Huh7 and LM3 cells at 24 h of PL treatment in a dosedependent manner (5-20 µM) (Fig. 1B). Consistently, the
rate of cell death as revealed by propidium iodide (PI)
staining (PI-positive nuclei) was evidently increased in
HepG2, LM3 (Fig. 1C) and Huh7 (Supplemental Figure 1)
cells at 24 h of PL treatment in a dose-dependent manner
(5-20 µM). Further, the number of apoptotic cells as
revealed by annexin V staining (annexin V-positive cells)
was significantly increased at 24 h of PL-treatment (20
µM) in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1D). In addition, flow cytometry
(FCM) analysis showed that at 24 h of PL-treatment (20
µM), the percent of sub-G1 cells (representing apoptotic
cells) was increased in HepG2 cells while the ratio of
G1/(S+G2) was not altered (Fig. 1E). Taken together, PL
selectively and effectively induced cell death including
apoptosis in HCC cells.

Piperlongumine preferentially suppresses HCC
cell migration and invasion in vitro
HCC are highly malignant tumors and cancer cell
invasion or metastasis is the major cause of death. We
examined the effects of PL on the ability of HCC cell
migration and invasion in vitro. In the scratch-wound
healing assay, cells along the wound-edge would migrate
into the nude space after scratching and the scratch-wound
would heal continuously (represented by the reduced
scratch-wound sizes between the opposite scratching
lines). In normal hepatic L-02 cells, PL treatment (within
10 µM) had no evident effect on the migration and the
wound-healing speed was not altered within 48 h of
PL treatment (Fig. 2A). In Huh7 (Fig. 2B) and HepG2
(Fig. 2C), however, PL prominently inhibited HCC cell
migration and reduced wound-healing speed at 24 or 48 h
of PL treatment in a dosage-dependent manner within 2.510 µM. Statistical analysis demonstrated that PL at lower
concentrations (2.5, 5 or 10 µM) significantly reduced
wound sizes of Huh7 (Fig. 2B) or HepG2 (Fig. 2C) cells

Piperlongumine induces ER stress-responses
which preferentially suppresses HCC cell
migration/invasion

while cell death in HepG2 or Huh7 cells was not altered
at 48 h of PL treatment at 10 µM (Supplemental Fig. 2).
Consistently, PL (10 µM) prominently reduced HepG2
cell migration at 48 h of PL treatment in the transwell
migration assays (left upper panels, Fig. 2D). Further, PL
(10 µM) significantly reduced invaded HepG2 cells in the
transwell invasion assay at 48 h after PL-treatment (left
lower panels, Fig. 2D). Statistical analysis demonstrated
that migrated or invaded HepG2 cells were significantly
reduced at 48 h of PL treatment (10 µM) (right panel,
Fig. 2D). These evidences together demonstrated that PL
preferentially suppressed HCC cell migration/invasion at
lower PL concentrations.

The downstream signaling pathways of ROS which
is responsible for PL’s anticancer effects remain elusive.
We examined the role of ER stress-responses in PLtreated HCC cells as the ROS-ER axis plays a pivotal
role in controlling ROS-mediated homeostasis and
cellular effects [20]. Western blotting analysis showed
that PKR-like ER kinase (PERK, a specific ER-stress
responsive protein) was prominently activated in HepG2
(Fig. 4A) and LM3 (Fig. 4B) cells at various time points
(e.g., 3 h as indicated by the red rectangular box) of PL
treatment in a dosage-depedent manner (0, 5, 10 and 20
µM). Fluorescent cytoimmunostaining assay also clearly
showed that the level of phosphorylated PERK (p-PERK)
was evidently increased in Huh7 (Fig. 4C) and HepG2
cells (Supplemental Fig. 4A) at various time points (3,
6 and 12 h) of PL treatment (20 µM). In addition, other
ER-endocking proteins such as glucose-regulated protein
78 (Grp78, i.e., BiP) and inositol-requiring enzyme-1α
(Ire 1α) were also clearly up-regulated at various time
points of PL treatment in HepG2 (Fig. 4A) and LM3 (Fig.
4B) cells. Consistently, the downstream product of ER
stress-response, CHOP, was also up-regulated evidently
at various time points of PL treatment in HepG2 (Fig.
4A and Supplemental Fig. 4A), LM3 (Fig. 4B) and Huh7
cells (Fig. 4C). ER is a major organelle storing Ca2+
which is released into cytosol to activate downstream
signaling pathways upon various stimuli including ROS
[28]. In primary rat hepatocytes, the concentration of
cytoplasmic free Ca2+ as measured by Fluro-3 AM (a
specific fluorescent probe for free calcium) was not altered
at 3 h of PL treatment (0, 5, 10 and 20 µM) (upper panels,
Fig. 4D). In HepG2 (middle panels, Fig. 4D) and Huh7
(lower panels, Fig. 4D) cells, however, the concentration
of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ was prominently increased at 3 h
of PL treatment in a dose-dependent manner (0-20 µM).
These evidences together verified that PL induced ER
stress-responses in HCC cells.
We then examined the roles of ER stress-responses
in PL’s anticancer effects in HCC cells by using specific
ER stress-response inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA)
[29, 30]. MTT assay revealed that 4-PBA did not alter PLinduced cell viability reduction in HepG2 or LM3 cells
(Supplemental Fig. 5A and 5C). Consistently, results of PI
staining showed that 4-PBA did not alter PL-induced cell
death in HepG2 cells (Supplemental Fig. 5B). However,
4-PBA completely abolished PL-suppressed cell migration
in HepG2 (Fig. 4E) and Huh7 cells (Supplemental Fig.
6) at various time points after scratching. Consistently,
4-PBA significantly reversed PL-suppressed HepG2 cell
migration in transwell migration assays and HepG2 cell
invasion in the transwell invasion assays (Fig. 2D). The

Piperlongumine induces ROS accumulation to
exert its anti-cancer effects on HCC cells
We then examined whether ROS accumulation
is required for PL’s anti-cancer effects in HCC cells as
previous studies have shown that ROS is the major
downstream player of PL’s action in many types
of cancer cells [13]. The fluorescent intensity of
2’-,7’-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA, a specific
ROS indicator) in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 3A) or L-02
cells (Supplemental Fig. 3A) was not altered at 3 h of
PL treatment (5, 10 and 20 µM). In HepG2 (Fig. 3B),
Huh7 (Fig. 3C) and LM3 cells (Supplemental Fig. 3B),
however, the fluorescent intensities of DCFH-DA were
evidently enhanced at 1 or 3 h of PL treatment. Statistical
analyses demonstrated that the intracellular ROS levels
were significantly increased in HepG2 and Huh7 cells
at 1 h of PL treatment (Fig. 3B and 3C). Pre-incubation
of antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, 3 mM)
completely abolished the effect of PL on ROS induction
at 3 h of PL treatment in LM3 (Supplemental Fig. 3B)
or HepG2 cells (Supplemental Fig. 3C). Consistently,
intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly
reduced in HepG2 or Huh7 cells at 1 h of PL treatment
(Fig. 3D). Pre-treatment of NAC (3 mM) reversed PL’s
effect on GSH reduction (Fig. 3D). Pre-treatment of
NAC or GSH completely reversed PL-induced cell death
in Huh7 cells (Fig. 3E) and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3F) while
delayed administration of antioxidants partially reversed
PL-induced cell death in HCC cells at a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 3E and 3F). In addition, administration of
NAC completely reversed PL-suppressed cell migration in
HepG2 cells after cell scratching (Fig. 3G). Consistently,
NAC abolished the PL’s suppression effect on cell
migration in the transwell migration assay (left upper
panels, Fig. 2D) and cell invasion in the transwell invasion
assay (left lower panels, Fig. 2D).

reversing effects of 4-PBA on PL’s effects on HCC cell
migration were close to those of NAC, suggesting that PL
inhibited HCC cell migration or invasion via ROS-ERmediated signaling preferentially.

the activation of MAPKs contributed to PL’s anti-cancer
effects in HCC cells. Pharmacological inhibition of p38,
JNK or Erk signaling pathway by using corresponding
inhibitor SB203580, SP600125 or U0126 did not alter
PL’s effects on cell death in HepG2 (Fig. 5C) or LM3
cells (Fig. 5D). However, suppressing p38 (SB203580),
JNK (SP600125) or Erk (U0126) signaling pathway
prominently reversed PL’s effects on HepG2 cell migration
at 24 or 48 h after cell scratching (left panels, Fig. 5E).
Statistical analysis demonstrated that the wound sizes
were significantly increased in SB203580/ SP600125/
U0126 plus PL 10 µM treatment groups as compared to
that in PL 10 µM treatment group in HepG2 cells (right

activation of MAPKs mainly contributed to PL’s effect on
cell migration.

Piperlongumine activates MAPKs signaling
pathways which preferentially suppress HCC
migration
MAPKs are canonical ROS- and ER-stress
responsive signaling pathways that control cell death
under oxidative stress [31, 32]. Results of Western
blotting analysis showed prominent activation of p38, JNK

various time points of PL treatment in a dose-dependent
manner (0, 5, 10 or 20 µM). We then examined whether

Piperlongumine functions through ROS-ERMAPKs-CHOP axis in HCC cells

The ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA showed similar inhibitory
effects on ER-MAPKs-CHOP signaling pathways
compared to NAC (Fig. 6A and 6B). Consistently, results
of fluorescent cytoimmunostaining assay also showed that
NAC and 4-PBA evidently reduced the elevated level of
p-PERK (Supplemental Fig. 4B) or CHOP by PL (Fig.
6C) at various time points of PL treatment in HepG2 cells.
Further, suppressing p38/JNK/Erk signaling pathways by
SB203580/SP600125/U0126 correspondingly evidently
reduced PL-elevated CHOP at 6 or 12 h of PL treatment in
HepG2 cells (Fig. 6C). These evidences demonstrated that
PL activated ER-MAPKs-CHOP axis signaling pathways

We then verified the existence of ROS-ERMAPKs-CHOP axis in PL-treated HCC cells by using
the corresponding inhibitors. Results of Western blotting
analysis showed that co-incubation of antioxidant NAC
with PL completely abolished PL-activated PERK (Fig.
6A, indicated by the rectangular box) and p38/JNK/Erk
(Fig. 6B), and PL-up-regulated Ire 1α and CHOP (Fig.

via ROS-dependent mechanisms.
Finally, we examined the role of CHOP in HCC
cell migration by knocking-down CHOP via small RNA
interference technique. Transfection of small interfering
RNA specific to CHOP (si-CHOP) [30] effectively
reduced the expression of endogenous CHOP in HepG2
cells (Supplemental Fig. 7A) but did not affect the
viability of HepG2 cells (MTT assay) at 24 h of PL
treatment (Supplemental Fig. 7B). However, transfection
of si-CHOP evidently accelerated HepG2 cell migration
at various time points (12, 24 and 36 h) after cell
scratching as compared to corresponding si-GFP (green
fluorescent protein) controls (Fig. 6D). Statistical analysis
demonstrated that knocking-down of CHOP (si-CHOP)
significantly reduced the wound-size of HepG2 culture
at various time points after scratching without or with
PL treatment (PL 0, Fig. 6E and PL 10 µM, Fig. 6F) as
compared to corresponding si-GFP controls. These results
supported that CHOP was required for suppressing HCC
cell migration and was a critical downstream target of PL’s
action in HCC cell migration.

PL selectively killed HCC cells and inhibited their
migration and invasion. PL activated ROS-ER-MAPKsCHOP signaling axis prominently, which consequently
suppressed HCC cell migration/invasion preferentially.
We demonstrated that PL was a selective anti-cancer
drug for HCC. PL effectively induced cell death in various
HCC cell lines including the highly malignant LM3 cells
[33] with an IC50 of 10-20 µM but had little cytotoxicity in
normal hepatic cells under similar conditions (Fig. 1). The
cytotoxic efficacy of PL in HCC cells was similar to that
in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells [9], suggesting
a general selective cytotoxicity of PL in those highly
malignant cancers. In addition, PL selectively suppressed
HCC migration/invasion but did not affect the migration
of normal hepatic cells (Fig. 2). Notably, PL at a lower
concentration (2.5-10 µM) exhibited a remarkable effect
on suppressing HCC cell migration in scratched cultures
in which PL-induced cell death was negligible (Fig. 2),
suggesting a major anti-cancer effect of PL on suppressing
metastasis. This is particularly important for the treatment
of highly malignant tumors such as HCC since metastasis
is the major cause of death [1-3]. Consistent with the anticancer effects of PL in vitro assays, PL was effective in
reducing HCC development in mice (Fig. 7). PL might
suppress HCC development in vivo via inducing cell
death, suppressing cell migration/invasion and reducing
tumor vessel formation (Supplemental Fig. 8). PL at
1.5-3.5 mg/kg/d showed comparable anticancer effects
in HCC xenograft-bearing mice, suggesting that the
therapeutic effects of PL in vivo reached a plateau at the
dosage around 1.5 mg/kg/d and that further increasing the
dosage of PL might not improve PL’s therapeutic effect
much due to the limited effective drug concentration in
cancer tissues, the varied sensitivity of cancer cells to
drug, the complicated feedback drug-resistant mechanisms
or the increased side effects of drug in vivo. Since PL is a
natural product which has been already used in traditional
medicines for a thousand years [12, 13], it is practical to
apply PL to the treatment of the highly malignant HCC
clinically.
Our data clearly demonstrated that the ROS
accumulation was a major initial factor responsible
for PL’s anticancer effects in HCC as pre-treatment
of antioxidants completely abolished PL-induced
cytotoxicity in HCC cells while delayed administration of
antioxidants (3-12 h post PL treatment) markedly reduced
their efficacy in antagonizing PL’s cytotoxicity (Fig. 3E).
Previous studies mainly focus on the cytotoxic effects of
PL in cancer cells and various ROS-dependent cell death
mechanisms, e.g., apoptosis [36-38], autophagic cell death
[16, 39], cell cycle arrest [17, 38], GSTP1 [13], p38 [9,
39], JNK [9, 38], Erk [15], which have been proposed in
different cancer cell lines. Until now, however, the exact
molecular mechanisms of PL’s action in cancer cells
remain largely unclear, probably reflecting the nature
of non-specific ROS stimulation in multiple signaling

Piperlongumine activates ER-MAPKs-CHOP axis
signaling and reduces HCC in vivo
After clarifying the anticancer effects and
mechanisms of PL in HCC cells in vitro, we examined the
role of PL in HCC-bearing mice. Equal amount of murine
ascetic H22 hepatoma cells was subcutaneously inoculated
into the flank side of adult male Kunming mice [33-35].
After 24 h of inoculation, PL was administrated once a day
by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection for 14 days consecutively
and then tumor xenografts were isolated. Fig. 7A showed
that the tumor xenografts from PL-treated groups were
evidently smaller than those from DMSO control group.
Statistical analysis demonstrated that the average volume
(Fig. 7B) and weight (Fig. 7C) of the tumor xenografts
from PL treatment groups were both significantly
decreased as compared to that from DMSO control group.
Notably, PL at a much lower concentration (1.5 mg/kg)
showed a comparable anticancer effect in HCC-bearing
mice and increasing PL concentration did not significantly
enhance its anticancer effects (Fig. 7A, 7B and 7C).
Consistent with in vitro assays, results of Western
blotting analysis demonstrated that PL significantly
activated p-PERK and up-regulated Ire 1α, PDI, and
CHOP in H22 tumor xenografts (Fig. 7D). Meanwhile,
MAPKs (i.e., p38, JNK and Erk) were significantly
activated in H22 tumor xenografts (Fig. 7E). These results
verified that the ER-MAPKs-CHOP signaling pathway
was activated by PL in HCC cells in vivo.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we demonstrated that

METHODS

pathways and the complicated regulatory mechanisms
involving in cell death process [5-9]. In HCC cells,
the PL-induced cytotoxicity could not be efficiently
reduced by a single signaling pathway inhibitor except
antioxidants, suggesting that multiple ROS-dependent
cell death mechanisms are involved in PL’s cytotoxicity
in HCC cells.
Unlike the elusive cell-death mechanisms
underlying PL’s action, we clarified a key signaling
pathway (i.e., ROS-ER-MAPKs-CHOP) which was
preferentially responsible for PL’s action on HCC cell
migration/invasion. Different from previous studies which
showed a differentially activation of p38, JNK and Erk
in distinct cancer cells [9,10,15], we demonstrated that
PL induced prominent activation of all the three major
MAPKs signaling pathways including p38, JNK and Erk
in HCC cells, supporting that MAPKs were major ROSstress responsive signaling pathways upon PL treatment.
It is well-known that ER is a major organelle responsible
for ROS accumulation [20] and MAPKs are canonical
downstream signaling pathways of ER stress-responses
[21]. Indeed, ROS-dependent activation of PERK, release
of Ca2+ and induction of Ire 1α were prominent in HCC
cells upon PL treatment (Fig. 4). Inhibition of ER stressresponses by 4-PBA suppressed PL-activated MAPKs
(Fig. 6), supporting that PL activated the MAPKs via ER
stress-responses in HCC cells. CHOP is a key ER stressresponse product involved in cell death [21]. Interestingly,
suppressing ER-MAPKs-CHOP signaling axis by either
inhibitors (4-PBA, SP, SB, or U0126) or knockingdown of CHOP did not affect the rate of HCC cell death
evidently but showed prominent effects on HCC cell
migration, suggesting that PL preferentially suppressed
HCC migration/invasion via ER-MAPKs-CHOP.
Consistent with PL’s effects on HCC cell migration, PL
also suppresses cell migration of highly malignant GBM
cells via ROS-p38/JNK/NFκB signaling [10]. These
evidences suggest that MAPKs might be a signaling hub
for PL’s suppressed effects on cell migration/invasion.
Further dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying
PL’s effects on cancer cell migration/invasion is important
for future applications of PL in cancer therapy.
In summary, we have demonstrated that PL
selectively killed HCC cells and suppressed HCC cell
migration/invasion. Preferentially, PL suppressed HCC
migration/invasion via ROS-ER-MAPKs-CHOP axis
signaling. Our data suggest that PL has the prospects of
application in the treatment of highly malignant HCC.

basement membrane matrix (BD Bioscience, Bedford,
MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
For both assays, the medium of lower chamber contained
800 µl of complete medium. After 24 h, the migrated or
invaded cells at the lower surface of the filter were stained,
micrographed and calculated as reported previously [10].
The average migrated/invaded cell number represented at
least nine different fields in each filter.

Cell viability or cell death assays
Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and
cell death was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay
or PI staining. For MTT assays, 5000 cells/well were
seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, cells
were treated with drugs in six parallel wells for designated
times and then assayed with MTT as reported [42, 43]. For
trypan blue exclusion assay and PI staining, cells at 60–
70% confluence in six-well plates were treated with drugs
in triplicates for 24 h and then subjected for corresponding
assays.

Measurement of intracellular ROS and reduced
glutathione (GSH)
Intracellular ROS level was measured using DCFHDA as reported previously [9, 10]. Briefly, PL-treated cells
were incubated with 10 µM of DCFH-DA for 30 min at
37°C, washed twice with PBS and then micrographed with
a conventional fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan). For each culture, a minimum of 9 random fields
were captured. Average fluorescent intensity was analyzed
using the Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics,
USA). For GSH measurement, PL-treated HepG2 or
Huh7 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times,
scrapped off from the plates and subjected to sonification.
The supernatants were collected and reduced GSH was
calculated according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute).

FCM assay was employed to analyze apoptosis
and cell cycle as previously reported [9]. HCC cells
were treated with PL for 24 h and co-stained with
annexin V-FITC and PI according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (KeyGEN BioTECH). Apoptotic cells
were separated and quantified by a FACSCalibur Flow
Cytometry System (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA,

were subjected to mini-PAGE gel electrophoresis and
transferred to NC membranes. The blots were incubated
with corresponding primary and fluorescent secondary
antibodies. The bands were quantified using the Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Bioscience, Lincoln,
NE, USA). β-actin was used as internal control. For
fluorescent cytoimmunostaining, PL-treated cells in
the 35-mm culture dishes were fixed, permeabilized,
blocked, and then incubated with corresponding primary
and Dylight 488-labeled secondary antibodies (Abbkine,
Redlands, CA, USA). Micrographs were taken under
the same conditions with a conventional fluorescent
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Cell migration after scratching was performed
as reported previously [10]. Briefly, confluent cells in
35-mm dishes were scratched with 200-µl pipette tips.
Immediately after cell scratching, the wounded edges
were micrographed (designated as 0 h). Scratched cells
were then incubated with fresh complete media with
appropriate concentration of drugs and the wounded edges
were micrographed at designated time points. The wound
size (i.e., the gap between the two opposite wounded
edges) was calculated using the Image-Pro Plus software
(Media Cybernetics, USA) and the average of wound
size represented at least 12 different fields in each culture
dish. Relative wound sizes of designed time points after
scratching were compared to that of 0 h control.

Transwell migration and invasion assays

Intracellular Ca2+ measurements

Transwell migration and invasion assays were
performed as reported [10, 44]. Briefly, HepG2 cells
(1×105 cells/well) were seeded into the upper chamber of
a transwell apparatus with a 8-µm pore size membrane
(Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) in 200 µl of
serum-free DMEM containing drugs. For the invasion
assay, the upper chamber was pre-coated with matrigel

Hepatocarcinoma 22 (H22)-derived solid HCC in
mice
Specific pathogen-free male Kunming mice
with body weights of 18-22g were purchased from the
Experimental Animal Centre, Huazhong University
of Science and Technology (HUST). All the mice were
housed in a clean environment and had free access to
standard rodent diet and water at room temperature and
a humidity of 45–55%. All the animal experimental
procedures are approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Tongji Medical College, HUST. H22derived solid HCC in mice was generated by injecting
2×107 H22 cells (in 0.2 ml of PBS) into the left armpits
of mice as described [47]. Twenty-four hours after initial
H22 inoculation, 50 mice were randomly divided into five
groups (i.e., DMSO, PL 1.5 mg/kg.day, PL 2.5 mg/kg.day,
PL 3.5 mg/kg.day and 5-FU 20 mg/kg.day; 10 mice/group)
and PL or 5-Fu was delivered as designated by i.p. once
per day for 14 days consecutively. H22-derived tumor
xenografts were harvested, measured and weighted on the
15th day of H22 inoculation as described previously [43].
