ABSTRACT
Hypoxia and NOTCH signaling have been reported to be associated with the selfrenewal and drug resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the molecular
mechanisms by which hypoxia and NOTCH signaling stimulate the self-renewal
and drug resistance of ovarian CSCs are poorly understood. In the present study,
we identified SOX2 as a key transcription factor for CSC-like characteristics in the
downstream of hypoxia-induced NOTCH signaling in epithelial ovarian cancer cells.
Hypoxic treatment or overexpression of intracellular domain of NOTCH1 (NICD1) in
ovarian cancer cells increased sphere formation, drug resistance, and expression of
CSC-associated genes such as SOX2, ALDH, and ABC transporters. Hypoxic treatment
increased the expression of NICD1, and hypoxic treatment or NICD1 overexpression
increased SOX2 promoter activity, which was inhibited by deletion of HIF-1 or
CSL binding sites. Furthermore, DAPT treatment decreased the effect of hypoxic
treatment, and SOX2 knockdown decreased the effect of hypoxic treatment and
NICD overexpression on sphere formation and drug resistance in established ovarian
cancer cell lines and primary ovarian cancer cells. These results suggest that hypoxiaNOTCH1-SOX2 signaling axis is important for activation of ovarian CSCs, which may
provide a novel opportunity for developing therapeutics to eradicate CSCs in ovarian
cancer patients.

enriched spheres are considered to disseminate cancers
in the peritoneal cavity and cause recurrence with drug
resistance [4]. It has been shown that the drug resistance
property of CSCs is conferred by increased expression
of multidrug resistance proteins, such as ABCG2 [5].
In addition, accumulating evidences suggests aldehyde
dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) as a marker of ovarian CSCs
[6]. Ovarian cancer cells with high ALDH1 expression
displayed CSC-like properties, such as anchorageindependent growth and enhanced drug resistance [7].

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among
cancer-related diseases in women [1]. Though ovarian
cancer is initially chemoresponsive, the majority of
patients experience relapses with chemoresistance within
5 years, which renders ovarian cancer as a cancer stem cell
(CSC)-related disease [2]. CSCs have been shown to be
enriched in sphere cultures, which are often more resistant
to chemotherapeutic reagents [3]. In ovarian cancer, CSC-

As the main source of relapse in ovarian cancer has been
attributed to CSCs, the necessity for development of a new
therapeutics to eradicate CSCs has been increasing.
Hypoxic microenvironments have been identified
in many solid tumors and implicated in development
of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [8]. Hypoxia
signaling stimulates stemness-related pathways including
OCT4, SOX2, NOTCH, and ABC transporters, which are
responsible for multiple drug resistance [9]. Hypoxiainducible factor-1a (HIF-1α), which is induced by hypoxia,
confers protection of cancer cells against chemotherapeutic
drugs-induced cell death [10]. After binding to the cognate
enhancer sequence, HIF-1α activates the transcription of
various genes required for tumorigenesis and metastasis
[11]. In ovarian cancer, hypoxic microenvironment is
known to increase CSC characteristics including sphere
formation, the higher proliferation, the higher infiltration,
and expression of OCT4 and SOX2 [12]. In spite of
importance of hypoxic microenvironment in stimulating
CSC-like characteristics, the molecular mechanisms by
which hypoxia promotes generation of CSCs in ovarian
cancer are still elusive.
NOTCH signaling is involved in various cellular
processes during embryo development and stem cell
maintenance in adult tissue [13, 14]. NOTCH signaling
is activated upon ligand binding and release of NOTCH1
intracellular domain (NICD1), which translocates to the
nucleus and binds to a DNA-binding transcription factor
CSL [15]. Aberrant activation of NOTCH signaling has
been identified in multiple cancers including leukemia,
breast, brain, colorectal, and ovarian cancer [16]. Recent
studies of NOTCH signaling in ovarian cancer have
found a critical role of NOTCH1 in proliferation and
metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of
NICD1 enhanced proliferation of ovarian carcinoma cells,
and NICD1 expression was identified in 76% of primary
ovarian tumors [17, 18]. Association of activation of
NOTCH1 signaling with chemoresistance and metastasis
of ovarian carcinoma has been reported [19, 20]. In
addition, increased expression of NOTCH1 was identified
as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival of
epithelial ovarian cancer patients [21]. However, NOTCH
downstream effectors in ovarian cancer, particularly in
CSCs, have not been clearly identified.
SOX2 is a transcription factor with characteristics
of regulating self-renewal and differentiation of
embryonic stem cells and reprogramming of somatic
cells to pluripotent stem cells [22, 23]. Accumulating
data have shown elevated expression of SOX2 in
several types of CSCs, including breast, gastric, lung,
and ovarian cancer [24]. In human ovarian carcinoma,
SOX2 expression showed correlation with stem cell state
[25]. SOX2 expression was increased in tumor spheres,
and overexpression of SOX2 stimulated CSC properties
including stemness marker expression, sphere formation,
in vivo tumorigenicity, and resistance to apoptosis.

However, the regulation mechanism of SOX2 expression
in the ovarian CSC population has not been understood.
In the current study, we explored the roles of
hypoxia, NOTCH1, and SOX2 in the sphere-forming
ability, drug resistance, and CSC marker expression of
CSC-like cells isolated from ovarian cancer cell lines
and primary ovarian cancer cells. We demonstrated that
hypoxia-NOTCH1-SOX2 signaling axis activates the
acquisition of CSC-like characteristics in ovarian cancer
cells.

RESULTS
SOX2 expression is increased in sphere-forming
ovarian CSCs
CSCs have been suggested to possess anchorageindependent growth and sphere-forming abilities in a
serum-deprived suspension culture [4, 26]. We have
recently reported isolation of sphere-forming CSCs from
several epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and primary
ovarian cancer cells [27, 28]. In the present study, we
isolated sphere-forming cells from three ovarian cancer cell
lines, SKOV3, PA-1, and A2780 cells, by culturing cells
in CSC culture medium (Figure 1A). In measurement of
SOX2 expression by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry,
spheres (SP) derived from A2780, SKOV3, PA-1 showed
the increase of SOX2 expression compared with their
adherent cells (AD) (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure
S1). Knockdown of SOX2 expression using shRNA
decreased sphere-forming ability of A2780 and SKOV3
cells along with reduced cell migration (Figure 1C–1F).
On the contrary, overexpression of SOX2 enhanced sphere
formation in A2780 and SKOV3 cells (Supplementary
Figure S2). These results suggest that SOX2 stimulates
sphere forming activity in ovarian cancer cells.

SOX2 expression is involved in chemoresistance
of CSCs through expression of ABC transporters
Resistance of CSCs derived from many cancers
to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents has been
previously demonstrated [29]. In evaluation of drug
resistance of adherent cells and spheres of A2780 or
SKOV3 cells, spheres showed the higher resistance to
paclitaxel compared with their adherent cells (Figure
2A). In assessment of expression of drug transporters
by RT-PCR and Western blotting, spheres showed the
higher expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 than adherent
cells (Figure 2B). Paclitaxel treatment time-dependently
increased the protein levels of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in
adherent cells and spheres of A2780 cells (Supplementary
Figure S3). Knockdown of SOX2 expression in
A2780 spheres (A2780-SP) resulted in significantly
decreased expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2, whereas
overexpression of SOX2 in A2780 adherent cells (A278055625

characteristics in ovarian cancer

AD) increased expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2
(Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S4). In addition,
knockdown of SOX2 expression in spheres resulted
in significantly decreased resistance to doxorubicin or
paclitaxel whereas overexpression of SOX2 in A2780-AD
increased resistance to doxorubicin or paclitaxel (Figure
2D and 2E). These results suggest that SOX2 increases
drug resistance through activating the expression of
ABCB1 and ABCG2 in ovarian cancer cells.

Hypoxic microenvironment was shown to stimulate
stem-like properties in ovarian cancer cells [12]. When
A2780-SP cells were subjected to hypoxic culture
(1% O2), sphere generation and cell proliferation were
augmented compared with incubation in normoxic
condition (Figure 3A and 3B). Spheres cultured in a

Hypoxia increases SOX2 promoter activity
through NOTCH1 activation

and Supplementary Figure 6A). Overexpression of NICD1
in adherent A2780 and SKOV3 cells resulted in increased
expression of NOTCH1, SOX2, and ABCG2 (Figure 4D).
When hypoxia-mimicking conditions were induced by CoCl2
or deferoxamine (DFO) treatment in A2780 or SKOV3
cells, HIF-1α expression was induced and expression levels
of NOTCH1 and SOX2 increased along with increased
generation of NICD1 (Figure 4E). Overexpression of NICD1
in A2780 or SKOV3 adherent cells resulted in significantly
increased ALDH activity (Figure 4F). When ALDHhigh cells
and ALDHlow cells were sorted and treated with DAPT or
paclitaxel, DAPT treatment resulted in decreased viability
of ALDHhigh cells, whereas paclitaxel treatment decreased
viability of ALDHlow cells (Figure 4G). Co-treatment of
DAPT and paclitaxel resulted in decreased viability of both
ALDHhigh cells and ALDHlow (Figure 4G). These results
suggest that NOTCH1 signaling is critical for maintaining
and inducing CSC characteristics in ovarian cancer cells. In
addition, NOTCH1 signaling may mediate hypoxia signaling
to induce SOX2 expression, and co-treatment with DAPT
and paclitaxel resulted in decreased viability of both CSCand non-CSC populations in ovarian cancer cells.

We observed that expression of SOX2 was
significantly increased by hypoxic stress or NICD1
overexpression. To explore whether hypoxic culture
condition can activate SOX2 transcription, A2780 ovarian
cancer cells were transfected with SOX2 promoter reporter
construct and treated with CoCl2. As shown in Figure 5A,
CoCl2 treatment resulted in significantly increased SOX2
promoter activity (SOX2-1545). To evaluate whether
NOTCH1 signaling can activate SOX2 transcription,
A2780 ovarian cancer cells were co-transfected with
SOX2 promoter-driven reporter construct and NICD1
overexpression construct. As shown in Figure 5B, NICD1
overexpression resulted in significantly increased SOX2
promoter activity. When binding sites of HIF-1α and
CSL, a DNA binding partner of NOTCH1 signaling, were
searched in the SOX2 promoter reporter construct, two HIF1 binding sites and three CSL bindings sites were identified
(Supplementary Figure S7). Individual deletion of HIF1 binding sites in the SOX2 promoter reporter construct

resulted in a significant decrease of CoCl2- or DFO-induced
activation of SOX2 promoter (Figure 5C). To evaluate
whether hypoxia-induced activation of SOX2 promoter
activity is mediated by NOTCH1 activation, A2780 ovarian
cancer cells were transfected with wild type SOX2 promoter
reporter construct or CSL binding sites (1-3)-deletion
construct with or without NICD1 overexpression or DFO
treatment. As shown in Figure 5D, deletion of individual
CSL binding site showed that CSL-2 and CSL-3 are
required for NICD1-induced activation of SOX2 promoter
activity. NICD1 overexpression or DFO treatment alone
increased wild type SOX2 promoter activity. Deletion of
CSL binding sites in SOX2 promoter decreased NICD1induced activation of SOX2 promoter as well as DFOinduced activation of SOX2 promoter (Figure 5E). These
results suggest that SOX2 transcription is stimulated by

hypoxia and NOTCH1 signaling, in which hypoxic signaling
is mediated by NOTCH1 signaling in ovarian cancer cells.

SOX2 expression is required for hypoxia- or
NOTCH1-induced acquisition of CSC-like
characteristics in ovarian cancer cells
To explore whether SOX2 can mediate hypoxia- or
NOTCH1-induced augmentation of CSC characteristics
in ovarian cancer cells, SOX2 expression was silenced
together with incubation with hypoxic condition or
NICD1 overexpression in A2780 and SKOV3 ovarian
cancer cells. Knockdown of SOX2 expression with

Figure S6B and S6C). Moreover, knockdown of SOX2
expression along with NICD overexpression resulted in
significantly decreased NICD1-induced augmentation
of sphere forming activity or resistance to paclitaxel in
A2780 (Figure 6C–6E and Supplementary Figure S6D
and S6E). DAPT treatment, SOX2 knockdown, and
combination of DAPT treatment and SOX2 knockdown
decreased sphere forming activity of A2780 ovarian
cancer cells (Figure 6F). To further confirm the role of
hypoxia-NOTCH1-SOX2 signaling axis in ovarian CSCs,
A2780 cells were treated with different combinations of
CoCl2, DAPT, and SOX2 overexpression. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S8A, DAPT treatment markedly
attenuated CoCl2-induced increase in the sphere forming
activity. SOX2 overexpression, however, abolished the
inhibition of DAPT on the sphere forming activity. When
drug resistance was measured, DAPT treatment inhibited
CoCl2 induction of the drug resistance in A2780 cells.
SOX2 overexpression, however, abolished the DAPTinduced inhibition of the drug resistance, whereas SOX2
knockdown did not (Supplementary Figure S8B). These
results suggest that the hypoxia-NOTCH1-SOX2 signaling
axis is critical for acquisition of CSC characteristics in
ovarian cancer cells.

and cell proliferation. In support of the results, hypoxic
pretreatment of ovarian cancer cells, ES-2 and OVCAR-3,
increased expression of OCT4 and SOX2 and stem-like
properties including sphere formation, high proliferation,
and high infiltration [12]. These results indicate that
hypoxia induces CSC-characteristics in ovarian cancer
cells.
Hypoxia is known to fully activate expression
of NOTCH target genes through induction of HIF-1α,
which joins transcription activation complex including
NOTCH intracellular domain [14]. NOTCH shows
oncogenic effects in certain tumors, and the contribution
of NOTCH to CSC formation has been suggested [34].
Gene expression analysis of CSC-enriched ovarian cancer
populations, including sphere cells, side population, and
high-grade serous ovarian cancer, showed increased
expression of NOTCH1 [35–37]. In glioblastoma stem
cells, hypoxia stimulates HIF-correlated NOTCH
signaling [38]. In our study, hypoxic treatment of ovarian
cancer cells resulted in increased expression of NOTCH1
and generation of NICD1. In addition, CSC-enriched
spheres from different ovarian cancer cells showed
increased expression of NOTCH1, and inhibition of
NOTCH signaling with DAPT resulted in loss of CSC
characteristics, whereas NICD1 overexpression led to
acquisition of CSC characteristics. In addition, hypoxiainduced stimulation of SOX2 promoter activity was
abolished by deletion of CSL binding sites in the SOX2
promoter region. In a previous study, overexpression of
NOTCH3 in ovarian cancer cells promoted expansion of
CSCs, and treatment with γ–secretase inhibitor resulted in
depletion of CSCs with increased sensitivity to platinum
drug and decreased expression of stemness-related gene
expression [39, 40]. Taken together, our results suggest the
importance of NOTCH signaling for maintaining hypoxiainduced CSC characteristics in ovarian cancer cells.
SOX2 expression has been detected in various
cancers [24]. In gastric cancer and non-small cell lung
cancer, siRNA-mediated SOX2 knockdown resulted in
decreased sphere-forming ability and self-renewal of
the CSC population [41, 42]. In human serous ovarian
cancer cells, SOX2 overexpression increased CSC marker
expression, sphere formation, and in vivo tumorigenic
activity, with little effect on cell proliferation [25]. In
our study, SOX2 was a critical downstream effector of
hypoxia- and NICD1-induced enhancement of CSC
characteristics. SOX2 promoter activity was directly
stimulated by HIF-1α and NICD1, and hypoxia- or
NICD1-induced augmentation of CSC characteristics
was abolished by knockdown of SOX2 expression. The
interaction between Notch1 and Sox2 was suggested
through direct activation of Sox2 transcription by NICDCSL [43]. Furthermore, CSL-dependent activation of Sox2
after ectopic expression of NICD was also demonstrated
[44]. In the future study, chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis with HIF-1α or NICD1 antibodies would

SOX2 is important for maintaining drug
resistance of primary ovarian CSCs
CSC-enriched spheres were isolated from five
different primary ovarian cancer tissues. Spheres from
primary ovarian cancer tissues showed high expression
of SOX2 (Figure 7A and 7B). When single cells and
spheres were isolated from primary ovarian sphere
cultures, spheres showed the higher expression of
stemness-related markers ALDH1, SOX2, and ABCG2
along with the higher expression of HIF-1α and NICD1
(Figure 7C and 7D). Knockdown of SOX2 expression
with shRNA in primary ovarian cancer spheres resulted
in significantly decreased sphere forming activity and
ABCG2 expression (Figure 7E and 7F). DAPT treatment,
SOX2 knockdown, and combination of DAPT treatment
and SOX2 knockdown decreased resistance to paclitaxel
(Figure 7G). These results suggest that SOX2 increases
CSC characteristics and drug resistance in primary ovarian
CSCs.

DISCUSSION
Involvement of hypoxia in the activation of
stemness-related gene expression in cancer cells has been
reported [30]. HIFs have been shown to play important
roles in specifying and maintaining CSCs in glioblastoma,
leukemia, and breast cancer [31–33]. In the present study,
we demonstrated that culturing CSC-enriched spheres in
hypoxic condition further enhanced CSC-characteristics
including sphere size, expression of SOX2 and ALDH1,

complement the current results. Taken together, the results
suggest that SOX2 is a critical mediator of NOTCH
signaling for maintaining stemness-related characteristics
in ovarian CSCs.
In conclusion, we show that CSC characteristics in
not only ovarian cancer cell lines but also primary CSCs
are augmented in hypoxic condition, and NOTCH1 and
SOX2 are important mediators of hypoxia in ovarian
CSCs. In addition, NOTCH signaling was necessary for
hypoxia-induced augmentation of CSC characteristics

and grown in sphere culture medium or corresponding
experimental medium. Cells were grown for 7 days, and
the numbers of spheres were counted under a microscope.

Cell migration assay
Ovarian cancer cells were harvested with 0.05%
trypsin containing 0.02% EDTA, and suspended in a
RPMI medium with 10% FBS at a concentration of 1×105
cells/mL. Membrane filters (8-μm pore size) in disposable
96-well chemotaxis chambers (Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg,
MD) were pre-coated for 6 h with 20 μg/mL rat-tail
collagen at room temperature. Aliquots (50 μL per well) of
the cell suspension were loaded into the upper chambers,
and RPMI medium with 10% FBS or experimental
medium was placed in the lower chamber. After incubation
for 12 h at 37°C, the filters were disassembled, and the
upper surface of each filter was scraped free of cells by
wiping with a cotton swab. The numbers of cells that
had migrated to the lower surfaces of each filter were
determined by counting the cells in three different places
under the microscope (×100 magnification) after staining
with Hoechst 33342 (10 μM).

Hypoxic treatment
For hypoxia treatments, A2780 cells were incubated
under hypoxic conditions with 1% O2 using a Modular
Incubator Chamber MIC-101 (Billups-Rothenberg Inc.,
CA) or in the presence of 100 μM DFO and CoCl2 for 24 h.
Sphere cells were plated into laminin-coated 6-well tissue
plates (1×105/well), and CoCl2 and DFO stock solutions
were added to cell cultures to a final concentration of
100 μM. After incubation at 37°C for the indicated time
periods, cell culture medium was removed, and cells were
harvested after washing with HBSS solution

Cell culture
Human ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780, SKOV3,
and PA-1, were grown in the culture medium and culture
conditions recommended by the ATCC and harvested
by treatment with 0.25% trypsin. To generate spheres
of cells, over-confluent cultures of A2780, SKOV3,
or PA-1 cells were switched from 10% FBS to 1%
FBS in RPMI-1640 or α-MEM media. After two days,
floating spheres were collected by centrifugation of the
supernatant at 800 rpm (Hanil FLETA 5, rotor HSR-4S).
Harvested spheres (A2780-SP, SKOV3-SP, and PA-1SP) were grown in sphere culture medium (Neurobasal
media (1×) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 20
ng/mL bFGF, 10 ng/mL EGF, 2.5 μg/mL amphotericin,
100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and B-27
Supplement (50×) (Life Technologies, without serum) in
Ultra-Low Attachment six-well plates. Fresh medium was
added every two or three days. Spheres were transferred
to the next generation by dissociation into single cells
with Accutase followed by filtering through a 40-μm cell
strainer and plating at 104 cells/mL. Third-generation
spheres were used for all subsequent experiments.

Flow cytometric analysis
Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity was
measured using the Aldefluor assay Kit (STEMCELL
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) as described by
the manufacturer. Briefly, dissociated single cells from
adherent or sphere cells were re-suspended in Aldefluor
assay buffer containing an ALDH substrate, bodipyaminoacetaldehyde (BAAA), at 7.5 μM, and incubated for
1 hr at 37 °C. An identical reaction was also performed
in the presence of 15 mM diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB), an ALDH-specific inhibitor. Analysis of
fluorescence intensity of the stained cells was performed
using a FACSAria-III cell sorter (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lake, NJ). ALDH activity of the sample was
determined based on the fluorescence intensity beyond the
threshold defined by the reaction with DEAB. Aldefluor
staining was detected using the FITC channel. To prevent
cross-contamination between ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells,
sorting gates of these two populations were set up at least

Sphere formation assay

one log apart. The purity of the sorted populations was
reanalyzed using ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cells and was
found to be greater than 95%.

The human SOX2 promoter containing the HIF1and CSL-binding elements luciferase report plasmids
were cloned by PCR of human genomic DNA (forward:
5′-GGAAGGAAACTTAGACGAGGC-3′;
reverse:
5′- CTTCTCTCCCTTTCTTTCTC-3′ for SOX2) and
excising the promoter fragment from the above mentioned
products and subcloned into the Kpn1 (NEB #R3142)
and HindIII (NEB #R3104) site of the pGL3 basic vector
(Promega, Madison, WI). ABCG2 promoter construct
was a kind donation from Dr Ross [45]. NANOG-Core
promoter was purchased from Addgene (pNANOGLuc; Plasmid #25900). Deletion sequences in reporter
constructs are as follows: human ABCG2 promoter
(TTGATTTGTTTTTACTT, TGGAAATGTTTTCATTT);
human OCT4 promoter (ATCTAAAAACAAGAGGG);
human SOX2 promoter (TAGCGACAACAAGAGAA).
Deletion mutant constructs were generated using the
QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent
Technologies) according to the manufacture’s instruction.
The intended mutations were confirmed by sequencing
analysis of constructs.

Analysis of drug-induced cell death
A2780 spheres (A2780-SP) cells were dissociated
into single cells by treatment with Accutase, filtered
through a 40-μm cell strainer, and seeded at 10,000 single
cells per well into 24-well Ultra-Low Attachment plates
(Corning) in 500 μL sphere culture medium. In parallel,
A2780 cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well in RPMI1640 media with 10% FBS into tissue culture 24-well
plates (Corning). After 24 h, A2780-SP and A2780 cells
were switched to Neurobasal media without supplements
or serum or RPMI-1640 media, respectively, followed by
addition of paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich). After treatment
with paclitaxel for 48 h, cells were harvested and
subjected to the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. For the MTT assay,
cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with
100 μL of MTT (0.5 mg/mL) for 2 h at 37 °C. Formazan
granules generated by the cells were dissolved in 100 μL
of dimethyl sulfoxide, and the absorbance of the solution
at 562 nm was determined using a SunriseTM Absorbance
Reader (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland) after dilution to
a linear range.

Western blotting analysis
For Western blotting analysis, cells were harvested
and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1
mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
25 mM β-glycerol phosphate, and 1% Triton X-100; pH
7.4). Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane, and then stained with 0.1%
Ponceau S solution. After blocking in 5% nonfat milk, the
membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies,
and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the
enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (ECL,
Amersham Biosciences).

Gene silencing using shRNA lentivirus and
production of retroviruses
pLKO.1-puro lentiviral vectors expressing SOX2
shRNA and control shRNA (SHC002) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. For generation of lentiviral
particles, HEK293FT cells were co-transfected with the
shRNA lentiviral plasmid (pLKO.1-puro) and ViraPower
Lentiviral packaging mix (pLP1, pLP2, pLP-VSV-G; Life
Technologies) using Lipofectamine 2000 and the culture
supernatants containing lentivirus were harvested at
48 h after transfection. For lentiviral transduction, cells
were treated with the shRNA-expressing lentivirus in the
presence of 5 µg/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, MO). To
ensure shRNA-mediated silencing of SOX2 expression,
the mRNA levels of SOX2 and GAPDH were determined
by RT-PCR analysis.
Retroviral plasmids carrying the pMX-SOX2 were
kindly provided by Jeong Beom Kim (UNIST, Republic
of Korea) and individually co-transfected with packaging
plasmids (gag-pol and VSV-G) into Plat-GP cells using
Lipofectamine-Plus reagent. Plat-GP cells (RV-103, Cell
Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA) were maintained in DMEM
with high glucose, 10% FBS, 10 μg/mL blasticidin, and
1× penicillin-streptomycin. Virus-containing supernatants
were collected two days after transfection, passed through
a 0.45 μm filter, and stored at -80 °C.

RNA extraction and RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from 80–90% confluent
cultures using TRIzol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and reverse
transcribed into cDNA using the Reverse Transcription
cDNA Kit (#RT50KN; NanoHelix Co., Ltd). cDNA in
1 µL of the reaction mixture was amplified using the
Ready-2×-Go pre-mix PCR kit (#PMD008L; NanoHelix)
and 10 pmol each of sense and antisense primers. The
thermal cycle profile was as follows: denaturation at
95°C for 30 s, annealing at 54°C for 30 s depending
on the primers used, and extension at 72°C for 30 s.
Each PCR reaction was carried out for 25-30 cycles
and PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel
