Abstract
Daxx is a regulatory protein for apoptosis signal–regulating
kinase 1 (ASK1) which activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
(JNK) and p38 pathways in response to stressors such as
tumor necrosis factor-A (TNFA). Here, we show that TNFA
treatment induces the accumulation of Daxx protein through
ASK1 activation by preventing its proteasome-dependent
degradation. ASK1 directly phosphorylates Daxx at Ser176
and Ser184 and Daxx is required for the sustained activation of
JNK. Tumorigenic mutant p53, which binds to Daxx and
inhibits Daxx-dependent activation of ASK1, prevents Daxx
phosphorylation and stabilization. When mutant p53 was
depleted in cancer cells, Daxx was accumulated and the cellkilling effect of TNFA was restored. Our results indicate that
Daxx not only activates ASK1 but also is a downstream target
of ASK1 and that accumulated Daxx further activates ASK1.
Thus, the Daxx-ASK1 positive feedback loop amplifying JNK/
p38 signaling plays an important role in the cell-killing effects
of stressors, such as TNFA. Tumorigenic mutant p53 disrupts
this circuit and makes cells more tolerable to stresses, as its
gain-of-function mechanism. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7681–8]

Introduction
Daxx was identified as a Fas death domain–interacting protein
and shown to enhance Fas-induced apoptosis through the
activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; ref. 1). Daxx binds
to and activates apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a
member of the stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) kinase kinase (MAP3K) family (2, 3). ASK1 activates the
MKK4/JNK and MKK6/p38 MAPK pathways through their
phosphorylation. ASK1 displays proapoptotic activity in responding
to diverse stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), anti-Fas
antibody, and oxidative stress (3–5).
Daxx is a ubiquitously expressed gene (6) and has an essential
developmental function (7). Based on a recent study, Daxxsilencing in cells compels a resistance to cell death induced by
UV irradiation and oxidative stress, and an impaired JNK activation

(8), suggesting that Daxx is a regulatory upstream factor of JNK to
induce apoptosis. In addition, ASK1 / and JNK / cells are
resistant to TNFa-induced and H2O2-induced apoptosis (9, 10).
Nevertheless, controversial results have been reported that Daxx
has an antiapoptotic effect (11) or sensitizes cells to Fas-induced
apoptosis (12). Blocking of JNK activation and apoptotic induction
has been observed in cells overexpressing a dominant-negative
kinase-inactive mutant of ASK1 (K709M; refs. 3, 4). Furthermore,
ASK1 is required for sustained activation of JNK/p38 and apoptosis
(10). These findings suggest a physiologic significance in the
network of Daxx-ASK1-JNK signaling for apoptotic cell death.
Translocation of Daxx shuttling between the nucleus and
cytoplasm has been implicated in its apoptotic function (13). Daxx
is mainly located in the nucleus, whereas it is a proapoptotic signal
mediator in the cytoplasm when ASK1 is overexpressed (14). This
seems to be consistent with the report describing the cytoplasmic
localization of Daxx upon exposure to stresses such as Fas crosslinking (15). Homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (HIPK)
have been found to phosphorylate Daxx. HIPK1 phosphorylates
Daxx at Ser667 and consequently relocalizes Daxx from promyelocytic leukemia protein-nuclear bodies. The relocalization of Daxx
by HIPK1 is dependent on the HIPK1 active kinase domain,
however, independent of Daxx phosphorylation (16). The translocated Daxx binds to ASK1 and leads to ASK1 oligomerization
(17). HIPK2 also binds to Daxx and induces its phosphorylation,
which in turn leads to JNK activation.
Here, we report that TNFa treatment induces the phosphorylation and stabilization of Daxx protein through ASK1 activation,
which is essential for sustained JNK activation and resultant
apoptosis. This positive feedback loop mechanism is inhibited by
tumorigenic mutant p53.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid construction and short interfering RNA synthesis. Various
Daxx substitution mutants were generated by PCR with the primers T174A/
F (5¶-CAAATGCTGAAAACGCTGCCTCTCAG-3¶), T174A/R (5¶-CTGAGAGGCAGCGTTTTCAGCATTTG-3¶), S176A/F (5¶-GAAAACACTGCCGCTCAGTCTCCAAG-3¶), S176A/R (5¶-CTTGGAGACTGAGCGGCAGTGTTTTC-3¶), T181A/
F (5¶-GTCTCCAAGGGCCCGTGGTTCCCGGCGGCAG-3¶), T181A/R (5¶-CTGCCGCCGGGAACCACGGGCCCTTGGAGAC-3¶), S184A/F (5¶-GTCTCCAAGGACCCGTGGTGCCCGGCGGCAG-3¶), S184A/R (5¶-CTGCCGCCGGGCACCACGGGTCCTTGGAGAC-3¶), T174AS176AS178AT181AS184A/F (5¶-GAAAACGCTGCCGCTCAGGCGCCAAGGGCCCGTGGTGCC-3¶), and T174AS176AS178AT181AS184A/R (5¶-GGCACCACGGGCCCTTGGCGCCTGAGCGGCAGCGTTTTC-3¶).
For generating GST-Daxx 70 to 216 wild-type and its substitution mutants,
the NH2-terminal region of Daxx was amplified using primers (5¶-GGAGGAGGATCCCCTTCCTTGAACTTTGTAAGATGCAG-3¶) and (5¶-GGAGGAGAATTCCTAATCCAATTCTGAGAGATCCAACTC-3¶). The short interfering
RNAs (siRNA) for Daxx and negative control were obtained from Invitrogen.

The siRNA sequence for Daxx-1 was described previously (11): 5¶-GGAAAAGGAGUUGGAUCUCUCAGAA-3¶. The siRNA sequence for Daxx-2 is 5¶-CCCUCCCACACACCUCUCC-3¶.
Cell culture and transfection. HeLa, ME180, A431, A2058, and 293 cells
were cultured in DMEM (HyClone) supplemented with 10% FCS. HT29 cells
were maintained in McCoy’s5A (HyClone) supplemented with 10% FCS. For
transfection with plasmid DNA, 293 cells were transfected by using FuGene
6 (Roche) and transfection into HeLa and ME180 cells was performed by
electroporation with Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems). Duplex siRNAs were
transfected by using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen). HT29 cells (f2  105)
were infected with control or p53 shRNA (Imgenex) adenoviruses
(multiplicity of infection = 200) for 5 d.
Production of anti-phosphorylated Daxx–specific antibody. Antirabbit phosphorylated Daxx–specific antibody was generated by Open Biosystems with a synthetic phosphorylated peptide (CNTApSQSPRTRGpSRR),
which corresponded to pSer176 and pSer184-containing Daxx.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Cell lysate preparations,
Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation were described previously (18).
For immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated Daxx at Ser176 and Ser184, 1 mg of
cell lysates were incubated with 5 Ag of anti-phosphorylated specific Daxx
antibody or control rabbit immunoglobulin for 2 h at 4jC. Immunoprecipitated
materials were separated by SDS-PAGE. The primary antibodies were antiFLAG (M5, Sigma), anti-HA (3F10, Roche), anti–enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphorylated JNK (Cell
Signaling), anti-JNK (Cell Signaling), anti-p53 (FL393, DO-1, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-Daxx (Sigma), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), antiPARP (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.), and anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Immunoprecipitation kinase assay. Immunoprecipitation kinase assay
was performed as described (18). Briefly, cells were lysed and subjected to

immunoprecipitation with the 3F10 anti-HA antibody (Roche) for 2 h at
4jC. The beads were washed and then incubated with 0.2 Ag of substrate for
10 min at 30jC in the kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 100 Amol/L
of ATP and 0.3 ACi of [g-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by the
addition of SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylated proteins were resolved
by SDS-PAGE and measured by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).

Results
Accumulation of cellular Daxx protein in response to TNFA
treatment coincides with the activation of ASK1. TNFa
exposure induces two types of JNK activation, i.e., early and
sustained induction, mediated by a mammalian MAP3K, ASK1 (3,
4, 19). Daxx enhances apoptosis in cells by interacting with and
activating ASK1, which activates the JNK/p38 pathway. Interestingly, we observed that the cellular protein level of Daxx was
significantly increased in TNFa-treated cells (Fig. 1A; Supplemental
Fig. S1). Therefore, we investigated the effect of TNFa on cellular
Daxx at the protein level. Treatment with TNFa increased
endogenous Daxx expression levels in a dose-dependent manner.
These results indicate that there is a TNFa-dependent mechanism
to regulate Daxx levels in cells.
Because ASK1 is activated by TNFa (4), ASK1 activity is likely to
be critical in cellular Daxx accumulation. 293 cells were transfected
with either control vector or expression plasmids for ASK1-HA or a
dominant-negative kinase-dead mutant, ASK1 K709M (KM)-HA (4),
together with EGFP-Daxx and control EGFP to test the effect of

and EGFP together with control vector (3.1), ASK1-HA
or kinase inactive mutant K709M (KM)-HA, and then
cultivated for 2 d. Twelve hours after the treatment with
or without proteasome inhibitors (Pls), cell extracts
were prepared and subjected to Western blotting with
anti-EGFP antibody. Relative EGFP-Daxx protein
levels are shown as a ratio over the EGFP protein
levels (bottom ). NT, no treatment. Note that the
expression level of EGFP serves as an internal
reference of ectopic EGFP fusion protein expression.

Figure 2. ASK1 binds to the NH2-terminal region of Daxx. A, schematic diagram of deletion mutants of Daxx. Numbers indicate amino acid residues. B, mapping of the
ASK1-interacting region of Daxx. 293 cells were transfected with the plasmids expressing ASK1-HA and various deletion mutants of FLAG-Daxx, as indicated in A.
Two days posttransfection, cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, and the precipitated materials were analyzed by Western blotting
with anti-FLAG antibody. The 20% inputs for immunoprecipitation were analyzed for FLAG-Daxx and ASK1-HA proteins by Western blotting (Input WB ). C, ASK1
kinase activity is dispensable for the interaction of ASK1 with Daxx. Cell extracts from 293 cells expressing EGFP-Daxx 70 to 216 and either ASK1-HA or ASK1 KM-HA
were prepared and the expression levels of EGFP-Daxx 70 to 216 and ASK1-HA were determined by anti-EGFP and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. Because
the expression level of EGFP-Daxx 70 to 216 was higher in cells when expressed with ASK1-HA than with ASK1 KM-HA, the amounts of lysates for immunoprecipitation
were adjusted based on the Western blotting data for EGFP-Daxx 70 to 216 and ASK1. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody followed by
Western blotting for EGFP. IP, immunoprecipitation; WB, Western blotting.

ASK1 activity on the amount of cellular Daxx. The cellular level of
EGFP-Daxx was evaluated by Western blotting with EGFP as a
reference (EGFP-Daxx/EGFP ratio). Daxx accumulated in cells only
when transfected with ASK1-HA wild-type, but not with control
vector or ASK1 KM-HA (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3), and this was due to
Daxx stabilization because proteasome inhibitors eliminated this
effect (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6). Importantly, ASK1-dependent stabilization on Daxx level was also observed in three of its deletion
mutants (amino acids 1–625, 1–418, and 70–216), but not in other
mutants (amino acids 1–69, 625–740, 419–740, 279–740, and 217–
740; Fig. 1C; Supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest that the
NH2-terminal region, amino acids 70 to 216, of Daxx is the only
domain required for Daxx stabilization. The ASK1-dependent
phosphorylation in this region might lead to Daxx accumulation
by preventing proteasomal degradation.
Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the same region of
Daxx directly interacts with ASK1. ASK1-Daxx interaction was
studied by immunoprecipitation of ASK1-HA from 293 cell lysates
expressing both ASK1-HA and the various truncated forms of
FLAG-Daxx (Fig. 2A). ASK1-HA efficiently coimmunoprecipitated
with FLAG-Daxx 1 to 216, 1 to 493, and 1 to 625 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 3,
and 5), but not with 217 to 740, 494 to 740, and 625 to 740 (lanes 2,
4, and 6) of Daxx lacking the NH2-terminal region. Thus, the NH2terminal 216 amino acids of Daxx are sufficient for the interaction
with ASK1. We were also able to detect an association between
deleted region 70 to 216 of Daxx and ASK1, regardless of the ASK1
activity (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that amino acids 70 to 216

www.aacrjournals.org

of Daxx are responsible for the interaction with ASK1. The kinase
activity of ASK1 is not required for the interaction.
ASK1 phosphorylates Daxx on Ser176 and Ser184. We next
asked whether Daxx was a direct substrate for ASK1 kinase. An
in vitro ASK1 kinase assay was performed with bacterially
produced GST-Daxx 70 to 216 as a substrate. Wild-type ASK1
immunopurified from 293 cell extracts clearly phosphorylated GSTDaxx 70 to 216 (Supplemental Fig. S3).
There are 21 serine/threonine residues within amino acid
position 70 to 216 of Daxx (Fig. 3A). We generated various
substitution mutants of 21 serine (S)/threonine (T) to alanine (A)
within amino acids 70 to 216 of Daxx to determine the phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3B; Supplemental Figs. S4 and S5). The
in vitro phosphorylation of GST-Daxx 70 to 216 wild-type was evident by ASK1-DN, a constitutively active mutant of ASK1 (Fig. 3C,
lanes 2 and 5; ref. 5). Among mutants, GST-Daxx ST0, which lacks
five serine/threonine residues within amino acids 176 to 184
(Fig. 3B), nearly diminished its phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, lanes 4
and 6). Likewise, GST-Daxx S176/184A, which is a doublesubstituted mutant at Ser176 and Ser184 also drastically reduced
its phosphorylation level (Fig. 3C, lane 3; Supplemental Fig. S5).
Because these phosphorylation-deficient mutants still interact with
ASK1-DN, reduced phosphorylation is not due to the lack of
interaction with ASK1 (Supplemental Fig. S6). Conversely, GSTDaxx ST0-176/184S, which restored both Ala176 and Ala184 residues
to serines in ST0, regained its phosphorylation level. Again, there
was no difference between ST0-176/184S and wild-type in the

indicate the position of amino acid residues. B, five serine (S) and threonine (T ) residues between 174 and 184 (circled in A ) were characterized in detail. Substitution
mutants between amino acids 174 and 184 are shown. C, ASK1 phosphorylates Daxx on Ser176 and Ser184 in vitro . Recombinant mutant Daxx GST-fusion proteins
were incubated with a constitutively active mutant ASK1 DN-HA in the presence of [g-32P] ATP as described in Materials and Methods. The reaction mixtures were
separated in SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated GST-fusion proteins were determined by PhosphorImager. The protein levels of GST-Daxx wild-type and its substitution
mutants in the kinase reaction were visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue staining. D, phosphorylation of Daxx at Ser176 and Ser184 in vivo . FLAG-Daxx was expressed
with full-length wild-type ASK1-HA or ASK1 KM-HA and the phosphorylation status of FLAG-Daxx was determined. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with
anti-phosphorylated Daxx–specific antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-Daxx or FLAG antibodies. Because the expression level of FLAG-Daxx was increased
by the presence of ASK1, the amounts of cell lysate in the immunoprecipitation reactions were adjusted to contain equal amounts of Daxx protein (WB:FLAG-Daxx).

interaction with ASK1 (Supplemental Fig. S6). Single revertant
mutants ST0-176S and ST0-184S, carrying restored residues Ala176
and Ala184 to serine of ST0, respectively, displayed partial
restoration of phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, lanes 8 and 9).
ASK1-dependent Daxx phosphorylation was monitored in vivo
with an anti-phosphorylated Daxx–specific antibody raised against
a synthetic phosphopeptide encompassing pSer176 and pSer184 of
Daxx. Western blotting of precipitated materials with anti-phosphorylated Daxx antibody showed that FLAG-Daxx was phosphorylated
at Ser176 and Ser184 by ASK1 wild-type but not by kinase-dead
ASK1 KM (Fig. 3D). Similar results were obtained for endogenous
Daxx when constitutively active ASK1DN or ASK1 KM was
expressed (Supplemental Fig. S7A). Daxx was phosphorylated at
Ser176 and Ser184 by endogenous ASK1 when cells were treated
with TNFa (Supplemental Fig. S7B). Similar experiments were
performed with a phosphorylation-deficient Daxx mutant FLAG-

Daxx S176/184A. The amount of immunoprecipitated Daxx was
not increased either by ASK1 wild-type or TNFa-treatment,
indicating that the anti-phosphorylated Daxx antibody recognizes
phosphorylated Daxx on Ser176 and Ser184 (Supplemental Fig. S7C
and D). These in vitro and in vivo results show that Daxx is a
direct substrate of ASK1 and the Ser176 and Ser184 of Daxx are
phosphorylated. Furthermore, ASK1-dependent phosphorylation
of Daxx is induced by TNFa treatment, indicating that Daxx is a
physiologic substrate of ASK1 in cells.
ASK1-dependent phosphorylation of Daxx is critical for its
stabilization. We investigated the effect of Daxx phosphorylation
by ASK1 on its accumulation. The null-phosphorylation mutant
FLAG-Daxx ST0 failed to be accumulated by ASK1-DN (Fig. 4,
lane 8), whereas the revertant mutant FLAG-Daxx ST0-176/184S,
phosphorylatable by ASK1-DN, restored its ASK1-dependent
accumulation to a similar extent as that of wild-type FLAG-Daxx

Figure 4. Phosphorylation on Ser176 and Ser184 in
Daxx is critical for Daxx stabilization. 293 cells were
transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-Daxx
(wild-type, ST0-176/184S, or ST0) and EGFP together
with either empty vector (3.1), or expression plasmid
for ASK1 DN-HA or ASK1 KM-HA. Two days after
transfection, cell extracts were prepared and
FLAG-Daxx levels were compared by Western blotting
with anti-FLAG antibodies using the expression level of
EGFP as a reference. The expression levels of
ASK-HA DN and ASK1-HA KM are also shown by
Western blotting with anti-HA antibody.

Mutant p53 Disrupts the ASK1-Daxx Positive Feedback Loop

Figure 5. The activation of JNK by TNFa treatment requires Daxx, and the phosphorylation on Ser176 and Ser184 in Daxx is critical. A, phosphorylation on Ser176 and
Ser184 in Daxx is essential for ASK1-dependent sustained JNK activation. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids. Cell extracts were
prepared and analyzed for expression levels of phosphorylated JNK and total JNK by Western blotting. B, phosphorylation on Ser176 and Ser184 in Daxx is essential for
TNFa-induced sustained JNK activation. FLAG-Daxx wild-type or FLAG-Daxx S176/184A mutant expression plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells. Twelve
hours posttransfection, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of TNFa (1 ng/mL) for 18 h. The cellular levels of phosphorylated JNK and total JNK were
determined by Western blotting. C, Daxx is essential for sustained activation of JNK. siRNA for control, Daxx-1, or Daxx-2 were transfected into HeLa cells. Three
days after transfection, cells were incubated with TNFa (0, 1, or 5 ng/mL) for 18 h. The activation of JNK was determined by Western blotting with
anti-phosphorylated JNK antibody. Total JNK and Daxx were determined by Western blotting using anti-JNK and Daxx antibodies, respectively.

(Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 2, respectively). These results indicate that
ASK1-dependent phosphorylation of Daxx at Ser176 and Ser184 is
required for its accumulation in cells.
We next determined the functional significance of ASK1dependent Daxx phosphorylation in JNK activation. Ectopic
expression of ASK1, together with phosphorylation-deficient
FLAG-Daxx S176/184A, failed to activate JNK (Fig. 5A, lane 4).
Moreover, JNK was not activated with mutant FLAG-Daxx S176/
184A expression by TNFa treatment (Fig. 5B, lane 4). Because
sustained late phase JNK activation mediated through ASK1
enhances apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (10), it is
likely that Daxx also plays a critical role in ASK1-dependent
sustained JNK activation and apoptosis in human cells. We
determined the role of Daxx on JNK activation induced by TNFa
in HeLa cells. Cells were transfected with Daxx-1, Daxx-2, or control
siRNA and the activation of JNK was determined (Fig. 5C). JNK was
effectively activated in response to an increasing concentration of
TNFa. When Daxx protein was reduced by >90% with siRNA, the
activation of JNK by TNFa was completely abolished, and the JNK
activation levels became even lower than the basal levels. Because
the total JNK protein level was not changed during TNFa
treatment, the reduction of the phosphorylated form of JNK was
due to the inhibition of the ASK1-dependent JNK activation. These
results indicate that Daxx is required for the TNFa-dependent
sustained activation of JNK. We also determined the requirement of
Daxx in the apoptosis induced by TNFa. When Daxx expression
was depleted by siRNA, both the induction levels of PUMAa (20)
and the cleavage of PARP (11) were clearly reduced (Supplemental
Fig. S8). These results indicate that Daxx plays a critical role in
TNFa-dependent apoptotic cell death. The biological significance
of the phosphorylation of Daxx in TNFa-dependent apoptosis was
also addressed. When S176/184A mutant Daxx was expressed, the
cleavage of PARP was not enhanced by TNFa treatment
(Supplemental Fig. S9). These results indicate that the phosphor-

www.aacrjournals.org

ylation of Daxx on Ser176 and Ser184 plays a critical role in cellular
response induced by TNFa treatment.
Tumorigenic mutant p53 inhibits ASK1-dependent phosphorylation of Daxx and prevents TNFA-dependent accumulation of Daxx. We have previously reported that the inhibition of
Daxx-dependent ASK1 activation is a mechanism for mutant p53
gain-of-function (18). We therefore tested the effect of mutant p53 on
the ASK1-dependent phosphorylation of Daxx. We observed that
mutant p53 inhibits the ASK1-dependent phosphorylation of Daxx
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, lanes 2–5). The wild-type p53,
however, failed to inhibit Daxx phosphorylation (Fig. 6A, lanes 6–8).
These results indicated that the inhibitory effect is mutant p53–
specific. Furthermore, the Daxx-ASK1 association was not dependent
on ASK1 kinase activity and tumorigenic mutant p53 inhibits the
complex formation between Daxx and ASK1 (Supplemental Fig. S10).
The TNFa-dependent accumulation of Daxx was determined in
two cell lines (ME180 and HeLa) with wild-type p53 and three cell
lines (HT29, A431, and A2058) carrying endogenous mutant p53.
Daxx accumulation was observed in ME180 and HeLa cells (Fig. 6B,
lanes 1–6) but not in HT29, A431, or A2058 (Fig. 6B, lanes 7–15)
suggesting that the expression of mutant p53 interferes with Daxx
from TNFa-dependent accumulation.
If this is the case, depletion of mutant p53 should restore the
TNFa-dependent accumulation of Daxx and induces apoptosis in
cells. HT29 cells which express R273H (Arg to His substitution
mutant at amino acid 273) were infected with adenoviruses
expressing shRNA for p53 knockdown followed by treatment with
TNFa. The amount of Daxx was not increased by TNFa treatment
when control adenoviruses were infected (Fig. 6C, lanes 1 and 2).
However, treatment with TNFa induced the accumulation of Daxx
when mutant p53 was depleted (Fig. 6C, lanes 3–6). Furthermore,
when the accumulation of Daxx was restored, TNFa-dependent
apoptosis became evident as judged by the cleaved PARP. These
results suggest that HT29 cells fail to undergo apoptosis by TNFa

the amounts of cell lysate in the
immunoprecipitation reactions were
adjusted to contain equal amounts of Daxx
protein (WB:Daxx). B, TNFa does not
induce the accumulation of Daxx in cells
expressing natural tumorigenic mutant p53.
Two cell lines with wild-type p53 (ME180
and HeLa) and three cell lines with
expressing mutant p53 (HT29, A431,
and A2058) were examined for the
accumulation of Daxx in response to TNFa
treatment. Cells were incubated with
TNFa (0, 1, and 5 ng/mL) for 18 h and the
cell extracts were subjected to Western
blotting for Daxx and actin. C, depletion
of mutant p53 restores TNFa-induced
accumulation of Daxx and apoptosis.
HT29 cells were infected (multiplicity of
infection = 200) with adenoviruses
encoding control or p53 shRNA for 5 d
followed by treatment with TNFa at the
indicated concentration for 18 h. The cell
extracts were analyzed by Western blotting
with the indicated antibodies.

treatment because mutant p53 blocks JNK activation by preventing
Daxx-ASK1 interaction and the accumulation of Daxx in cells.

Discussion
We showed that the expression level of Daxx in cells was upregulated by ASK1 and that the ASK1 kinase activity is required for
this effect. Indeed, Daxx serves as a direct substrate for ASK1 and is
phosphorylated at Ser176 and Ser184 by ASK1. The serine residues at
176 and 184 in human Daxx are well conserved in mammals,
including chimpanzee, monkey, dog, cow, mouse, and rat,
suggesting the importance of these residues, and thus, the
regulation of Daxx function through the phosphorylation of these
serines might also be conserved. The molecular mechanisms for
TNFa-dependent sustained JNK activation have been proposed
involving caspase-dependent mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1
(MST1) cleavage or reactive oxygen species production (21, 22). We
found that Daxx is essential for the sustained activation of JNK and
apoptosis induced by TNFa in cells and Daxx phosphorylations are
necessary for TNFa-responsive cellular Daxx accumulation as well
as JNK activation. These results are consistent with what was
shown in ASK1 / mouse embryonic fibroblasts, in which ASK1

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

was essential for TNFa-induced sustained JNK activation (10). In
our Daxx knockdown experiment, TNFa treatment further reduced
the level of phosphorylated JNK when the protein level of cellular
Daxx was largely undetectable. This could be due to the activation
of MAPK phosphatases by TNFa as reported previously (23).
Previously, it was reported that ASK1 interacts with the COOHterminal region of Daxx during glucose deprivation (17). We found,
however, that ASK1 interacted with the NH2-terminal region of
Daxx and that the interaction was independent from the ASK1
kinase activity because both the kinase-inactive mutant of ASK1
(ASK1 KM) and wild-type ASK1 bind Daxx equally well. Most likely
the mode of ASK1-Daxx interaction is different from the ASK1MKKs complexation because Daxx is missing the DVD docking
domain present at the COOH terminus of MKK3/MKK6 and
MKK4/MKK7 (24). The sequence surrounding the phosphorylation
sites, Ser176 and Ser184, in Daxx differs from the previously
identified sequences in MKKs or the autophosphorylation sites
on ASK1 (25). Mutations on both serines did not affect Daxx-ASK1
interaction, indicating that these residues are dispensable for the
interaction. Furthermore, these results also confirm that the
interaction between ASK1 and Daxx is not affected by the Daxx
phosphorylation status of both serines.

Mutant p53 Disrupts the ASK1-Daxx Positive Feedback Loop

The involvement of ubiquitination in regulating MAPKs has been
recently illustrated (26). Because proteasome inhibitors abolish
ASK1-supported accumulation of Daxx, it suggests that Daxx
accumulation or degradation is proteasome-dependent. We and
others found that Daxx degradation is ubiquitin-dependent (27, 28).
However, a ubiquitin-independent proteasome-dependent Daxx
degradation initiated by human cytomegalovirus pp71 tegument
protein was also reported (29). It is reasonable to speculate that
the phosphorylation of Daxx by ASK1 affects the ubiquitin status
of Daxx (27).
Phosphorylation of proteins often plays a critical role in
ubiquitinating target proteins and the consequent protein
degradation (30, 31). Recently, the phosphorylation of Daxx has
been shown to induce its cellular degradation. Peptidyl-prolyl
isomerase (Pin1) binds to the phosphorylated Ser178-Pro179 motif,
although this is only present in human, in the Daxx protein, and
induces the rapid degradation of Daxx via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway (28). Pin1 catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs within its specific
target substrates. ASK1 phosphorylates two serines close to each
other in Daxx, thus, if Pin1 twists the Daxx molecule at Pro179
flipping Ser176 and Ser184 in trans position, it might prevent ASK1
from phosphorylating Daxx. The phosphorylation on Ser178 and
Ser176/Ser184 could be a tug-of-war situation to regulate Daxx
metabolism.
It has been recently reported that in response to DNA damage,
Daxx undergoes ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal
degradation. Daxx degradation promotes the translocation of
RASSF1C from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (32). Cellular inhibitor
of apoptosis protein 1 (c-IAP1), a regulator of TNF signaling, is a
ubiquitin ligase for ASK1, and p38 and JNK phosphorylations are
prolonged in c-IAP1 / B cells (33). Because p38/JNK activation by
Daxx depends on ASK1, c-IAP1 is also a key factor in modulating
Daxx activity and stability in stress signaling.
Mutations in p53 have been found in >50% of all human cancer
cells. Mutant p53s escape from MDM2/HDM2-dependent degra-

dation with the help of p16INK4a inactivation (34) and accumulate
to induce the malignant transformation (35, 36). Tumorigenic
mutant p53 inhibits the interaction between Daxx and ASK1, and
thus, inhibits the ASK1-dependent phosphorylation of Daxx. As a
result, mutant p53 inhibits Daxx-dependent JNK activation (18). We
propose a mechanism in which mutant p53 inhibits Daxx
accumulation by preventing the phosphorylation of Daxx in
response to stress signals. Heat shock protein 27 has been reported
to block apoptosis by inhibiting the interaction between Daxx and
ASK1 (15), providing another example for the biological significance of the cooperative activation between Daxx and ASK1 in JNK
signaling cascade. Therefore, blocking the Daxx-ASK1 circuit could
be one molecular mechanism for the gain-of-function of mutant
p53 which contributes to tumorigenesis.
Based on our results, we propose a positive feedback loop
mechanism between Daxx and ASK1 (Supplemental Fig. S11).
When ASK1 is activated by stresses, such as oxidative stress, UV
and cytotoxic cytokines like TNFa, ASK1 phosphorylates Daxx
and stabilizes it. This accumulated Daxx, in turn, further
activates ASK1 which reinforces the amplification of downstream
kinase activations including JNK and p38. Tumorigenic mutant
p53 and possibly heat shock protein 27 may break the circuit
between Daxx and ASK1 and thus cells will become more
tolerant to stresses.
