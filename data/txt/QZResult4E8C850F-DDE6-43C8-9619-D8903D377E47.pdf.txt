BACKGROUND. Approximately 20% of patients who have hepatoblastoma (HB)
still have unresectable disease after preoperative chemotherapy (POC). In these
circumstances, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) should be performed
1 month after POC. The authors sought to identify presenting features that would
predict unresectability in patients with HB and to provide suggestions for early
referral and listing for OLT.

METHODS. Notes, radiology films, and histology from patients who were treated
over the previous 20 years were reviewed. Unfeasible resection was defined by
bilobar involvement, vascular extension, and metastatic disease after POC. Failed
conservative treatment (FCT) was used to categorize patients who were not dis-

RESULTS. Of 28 patients who were studied, 14 patients underwent resection, and
because of tumor progression. Overall, the 5-year survival rate was 76% (95%
confidence interval, 54.8–89%). Predictors of FCT were multifocality (P 5 .006), a
high pretreatment extent of tumor (PRETEXT) score (III or IV; P 5 .006), portal
vein involvement (P 5 .02), hepatic vein involvement (P 5 .02), or vena cava
involvement (P 5 .05). Patients who achieved a curative resection presented at a
younger age (median, 0.7 years vs 4.2 years, P 5 .02). Patients who had multifocal
lesions and those who had an a-fetoprotein (aFP) level <100 ng/mL survived
only if they underwent transplantation.

CONCLUSIONS. Patients with HB who were managed by combined chemotherapy
and surgery has a high survival rate. Older patients who had multifocal tumors,
high PRETEXT scores, involvement of major liver vessels, and aFP levels
<100 ng/mL were less likely to achieve curative resection. These findings at presentation should lead the clinicians to liaise early with a transplantation center.

epatoblastoma (HB), although it is rare, is the most common
liver tumor in children.1 The probability of curing such a malignancy is related strictly to the feasibility of achieving a complete
resection of the mass.2 Although it has been demonstrated that
chemotherapy is effective in shrinking the mass and easing its complete excision, approximately 20% of tumors remain unresectable.3
In this setting, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become
the only option to achieve complete tumor excision through the removal and substitution of the organ itself. Some investigators have
demonstrated that liver transplantation can be very successful in
children who have an unresectable HB.4–7 Currently, the decision to
proceed to OLT is based on postchemotherapy features of the lesion;
however, this approach is accompanied by the risks of late referral
to a transplantation center and delayed listing and donor availabil-

ity. In the current study, we sought to identify the
risk factors for unresectability on the basis of the
presenting features of children with HB who presented consecutively at our center and were managed under the directives of the International
Childhood Liver Tumor Strategy Group of the Society
of Pediatric Oncology (SIOPEL).8

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was performed retrospectively by retrieving the notes of all consecutive patients who were
diagnosed with HB at our center between January
1986 and June 2005. All patients were staged according to the SIOPEL pretreatment extent of disease
(PRETEXT) system. The diagnosis always was confirmed by histologic examination. The PRETEXT system is based on a computed tomography (CT) scan
at diagnosis and divides the liver into 4 sectors. The
tumor is classified into 4 categories, depending on
the number of liver sectors that are free from tumor:
A PRETEXT score of I indicates 3 adjacent sectors
free of tumor, a PRETEXT score of II indicates 2 adjacent sectors free of tumor (or 1 sector in each hemiliver), a PRETEXT score of III indicates 1 sector free
of tumor (or 2 sectors in 1 hemiliver and 1 nonadjacent sector in the other hemiliver), and a PRETEXT
score of IV indicates no tumor-free sectors.9

Clinical Features
Clinical features, radiology films, and histology were
reviewed. The patients’ characteristics were divided
in presenting features, features after preoperative
chemotherapy (POC), and features at the last followup.
We collected the following data: age at diagnosis,
age at operation (either resection or transplantation),
histologic features, a-fetoprotein (aFP) level at diagnosis, surgery and follow-up, PRETEXT score, chemotherapy regimen adopted before and after surgery,
cardiac function tests (shortening fraction), renal
function tests (creatinine clearance according to
Schwartz et al.10), liver function tests, patient survival, and graft survival. The radiology films that
were obtained at diagnosis and during follow-up and
the histology slides were reviewed blindly by a single
radiologist (E.T.) and by a single pathologist (M.R.),
respectively. The amount of tumor shrinkage after
chemotherapy, assessed by CT scan, was calculated
as the percentage reduction of the mass volume in
unifocal tumors or of the largest lesion in multifocal
tumors.

1051

Chemotherapy
All patients were treated according to the SIOPEL
protocols (for descriptions, see Table 1).11,12 January
1990 was the date of the actual opening of the SIOPEL 1 protocol to patient registration in our center;
before that date, patients were treated according to
the SIOPEL 1 protocol but outside of the actual trial.
Liver Resection and Transplantation
The patients were referred for resection or transplantation after they were evaluated for resectability
through discussions with a pediatric radiologist, a
pediatric surgeon, a transplantation surgeon, a pediatric oncologist, and a pediatric hepatologist; the decision was based on liver imaging studies, including
ultrasound and liver and lung contrast-enhanced CT
scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at presentation and after POC. Unfeasibility
of resection was determined by bilobar involvement,
vascular extension to the major liver vessels, or metastatic disease after POC. Vascular involvement was
defined by the closeness, the invasion, or the obliteration of the liver vessel by the tumor as assessed
by CT scan. Portal vein involvement was defined as
extension of the tumor either to the portal trunk or
to both the left and right portal branches. Hepatic
vein involvement was defined as extension of the tumor to the middle hepatic vein with or without
involvement of the lateral veins. The type of operation was left lateral segmentectomy, left or right
hemihepatectomy, or extended hemihepatectomy. We
defined successful resection (SR) as the evidence of
disease-free survival >1 year after conservative surgery. Failed conservative treatment (FCT) was used to
categorize patients who were not disease-free with
their native liver after 1 year of follow-up postsurgery.
Immunosuppression after OLT included calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids, as described
previously.13 From 2001 onward, patients with impaired renal function were given micophenolate
mofetil as part of the immunosuppressive regimen.
Statistical Analysis
Data are reported as median and range or counts
and percentages where appropriate. Continuous variables were compared by using a Wilcoxon rank-sum
test; for paired data, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
was used. Percentages were analyzed using the
Fisher exact test. The accuracy of continuous variables predicting FCT was assessed according to the
area under the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve (AUC). The ROC curve was analyzed to
select the best cut-off value for maximizing sensitiv-

ity and specificity. All tests that yielded P values .05
were considered significant. All analyses were performed using the SAS statistical package (release
8.02; SAS, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
The notes on 28 consecutive patients who were treated at our institution for HB were available for
review. Eighteen patients were males, and 10 were
females. The median age at presentation was 1.7 years
(range, 0.04–34.5 years) (Table 2).

Presenting Features
Histology was fetal in 13 patients (46%), mixed in 9
patients (32%), embryonal in 4 patients (14%), anaplastic in 1 patient, and transitional in 1 patient. The
median aFP level was 52,547 ng/mL (range, 4-,
1,270,000 ng/mL). Four patients had aFP levels
<100 ng/mL. Ten patients (36%) had multifocal
tumors, whereas 18 patients (64%) had unifocal
tumors. One patient (4%) had a PRETEXT score of I,
5 patients (18%) had a score of II, 11 patients (39%)
had a score of III, and 11 patients (39%) had a score
of IV. Twenty-one patients (75%) had hepatic vein involvement, 14 patients (50%) had portal vein involvement, and 17 patients (61%) had vena cava
involvement. Only 1 patient had metastasis at presentation (Table 2).

Chemotherapy and Preoperative Features
Sixteen patients (57%) entered the SIOPEL 1 protocol, 2 patients (7%) entered the SIOPEL 2 protocol, 9
patients (32%) entered the SIOPEL 3 protocol, and 1
patient (4%) entered the SIOPEL 4 protocol. However, 2 patients received no chemotherapy and
underwent surgery during the first month of life; 1
patient had a pedunculated tumor, and the other
patient presented with liver failure.
After chemotherapy, the median aFP level was
1488 ng/mL (range, 10–130,000 ng/mL; prechemotherapy vs postchemotherapy: P 5 .01); and the
median tumor shrinkage, as determined from a CT
scan or an MRI, was 60% (range, 0–93%). Four
patients, however, had disease progression with
appearance of lung metastases during chemotherapy.
In patients who presented with aFP levels <100 ng/
mL, the tumor shrinkage was <10%.
Surgical Features
Twenty-four patients (85%) underwent surgery at a
median age of 1.6 years (range, from 16 days to
34.1 years). Four patients did not undergo surgery
because of disease progression. Fourteen patients
underwent resection, whereas 10 patients underwent
liver transplantation because their tumor was considered unresectable. One of the 10 transplantation recipients had presented with a multifocal tumor, had 1
lobe cleared with chemotherapy, underwent resection

but subsequently had recurrence of disease in the
liver, and underwent a rescue OLT.

Predictors of FCT
Fifteen patients (54%) received FCT, including 10
patients who underwent OLT, 4 patients who died
from disease progression, and 1 patient who died after resection. Thirteen patients (46%) underwent SR.
We compared the presenting features of patients who
received FCT with patients who underwent SR.
Patients who were older at diagnosis had a worse
prognosis (median, 4.2 years vs 0.7 years; P 5 .02).
The AUC was 0.75 (95% confidence interval [95% CI],
0.55–0.89; P 5 .006). Age >3.2 years at presentation
was the cut-off age with the best balance between
sensitivity and specificity: 60% (95% CI, 32.3–83.6%)
and 92.3% (95%, CI 63.9–98.7%), respectively. Other
predictors of a poor prognosis were multifocality (9
of 15 patients vs 1 of 13 patients; P 5 .006), a PRETEXT score of III or IV (P 5 .006), hepatic vein involvement (14 of 15 patients vs 7 of 13 patients;

P 5 .02), portal vein involvement (11 of 15 patients vs
3 of 13 patients; P 5 .02), vena cava involvement (12
of 15 patients vs 5 of 13 patients; P 5 .05), and an
aFP level <100 ng/mL (4 of 15 patients vs 0 of 13
patients; P 5 .04). Shrinkage of the mass was much
greater in patients who had aFP levels >100 ng/mL
compared with the other patients (P 5 .01). Excluding those patients who were diagnosed in adulthood
from the analysis, the age difference between
patients who received FCT and patients who underwent SR remained statistically significant (P 5 .03).
Patient 5 had a multifocal tumor that turned out
to be unilobar after chemotherapy and, thus, was
resected. Patient 12 had a lesion that was classified
as unifocal with a Pretext score of IV; after chemotherapy, the massive shrinkage of the tumor demonstrated a single mass that involved only 1 lobe and
was resected.
The percentage reduction of the mass (or of the
largest lesion in multifocal tumors) was a median of
51% (range, 0–93%) in patients who underwent

transplantation and 84% (range, 0–92%) in patients
who underwent resection (P 5 .04). Two patients
who underwent transplantation (Patients 18 and 21),
1 patient who underwent resection (Patient 10), and
all patients who underwent no surgery (Patients 25–
28) did not respond to chemotherapy, as demonstrated by tumor shrinkage 10%. Among the 7
patients who were unresponsive to chemotherapy
were the 4 patients who presented with aFP levels
<100 ng/mL. Sex, histologic subtype, chemotherapy
protocol, and aFP levels if >100 ng/mL did not affect
successful management by conservative surgery.

Outcome
After a median follow-up of 5.3 years (range, 0.5–
18.8 years) after surgery, 21 of 28 patients (75%)
remained alive with no evidence of disease. Thirteen
of 14 patients (93%) who underwent resection
remained alive with no evidence of disease at a
follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 0.5–16 years). Patient
7 developed an extrahepatic recurrence at 4 months
and died from lung metastases 12 months after
resection (Table 3). Eight of 10 patients (80%) who
underwent OLT were disease free 4.2 years (range,
0.5–18.8 years) after surgery. Four patients died without undergoing surgery (Patients 25–28) at 3 months,
5 months, 3 months, and 7 months after diagnosis,
respectively, because they presented with uncontrolled disease and progression of lung metastasis either at diagnosis or during POC (Table 3). The eventfree survival rate was 73.5% (95% CI, 52–86.5%) at
5 years and 63% (95% CI, 34.9–81.7%) at 10 years. The
overall survival rate was 76.7% (95% CI, 54.8–89%) at
5 years and 69.7% (95% CI, 45–85%) at 10 years.
Features and Outcome of Transplanted Patients
Ten patients had tumors that were deemed unresectable and underwent transplantation, including 5
patients who received a whole organ graft, 4 patients
who received a left lateral segment (1 from a living
donor), and 1 patient who received an extended left
lobe. The transplantation was performed at a median
of 27 days (range, 19–65 days) after the last course of
chemotherapy. Among 9 patients who presented with
vena cava involvement, 5 patients received a caval
replacement as part of liver transplantation surgery
(Table 4). Seven of the 10 transplantation recipients
received postoperative chemotherapy without serious
complications. During chemotherapy, the immunosuppressive regimen was reduced slightly to 75% of
the calcineurin-inhibitor levels adopted for standard
OLT care.
Eight of 10 patients (80%) who underwent OLT
were alive with no evidence of disease after a median

follow-up of 4.2 years post-transplantation. Among
the 10 patients who underwent OLT, 2 (Patients 19
and 20) died of disease at 5.4 years and 2.1 years
post-transplantation after they developed disease recurrence at 12 months and 4 months, respectively.
after surgery. Patient 19 had presented with an acute
abdomen because of tumor rupture and intraperitoneal bleeding; he had a tumor adjacent to the vena
cava at the time of OLT and received a living donor
graft with no caval replacement. He developed a recurrence of the disease around the retrohepatic vena
cava and died of local and distant tumor progression
despite a further attempt at surgical resection followed by interstitial radiotherapy and systemic
chemotherapy. Patient 20 had a bilobar, multifocal
tumor at diagnosis that became unilobar after preoperative treatment and, thus, we decided to perform
a resection; however, after 4 months, the patient
developed a hepatic recurrence for which he underwent rescue liver transplantation. Eventually, he died
from pulmonary metastasis 2.1 years after OLT.
Patient 18, who had an aFP-negative HB, developed
2 diaphragmatic recurrences, which were cleared by
surgery at 8 years and 10 years after OLT; at the time
of last follow-up, she was alive with no evidence of
disease 11 years after OLT and 18 months after the
last recurrence.
At the last follow-up visit, all patients had normal graft function. Left ventricular shortening fraction was normal (>30%) in all surviving patients.
Among long-term survivors, the median creatinine
clearance of patients who underwent transplantation
was 70 mL per minute/m2, and it was reduced in
50% of patients; whereas, in patients who underwent
resection, it was 103 mL per minute/m2, and it was
reduced only in 1 patient (P 5 .008). However, none
of the transplantation recipients were on dialysis or
had a creatinine clearance <30 mL per minute/m2.

DISCUSSION
HB is an embryonal tumor of the liver with an incidence from 0.8 to 1 per million.1 Because of its rarity,
to our knowledge, no single-center studies have
included a consecutive cohort of children who were
treated homogenously either by resection or transplantation. The management of children with HB has
evolved over approximately the last decade, and the
SIOPEL approach has proven effective in the treatment of this tumor.11,12 One of the unanswered questions is when to refer a child for evaluation of
transplantation. Indeed, many centers treat HB, but
few can perform a transplantation if required. Identifying the risk factors for unresectability at presenta-

tion can ease the decision making on the timing for
referral to a transplantation center.
Several groups have reported good results of OLT
for unresectable HB managed under different chemotherapeutic protocols.5,6,14 The SIOPEL group
developed a strategy based on preoperative staging
(PRETEXT) and the use of POC with cisplatin and
doxorubicin in all patients followed by delayed surgery.7–9,15,16 Outside of the SIOPEL protocols, other
groups have reported a good outcome after transplantation.4,5,17,18 Despite these promising data, to
date, the issue of selecting the appropriate candidate
for OLT in time has not been addressed fully. The decision to transplant should be prompt, because referral to a transplantation center, evaluation with
appropriate work-up, and time spent on the waiting
list does not always allow patients to remain within
the protocol schedule. According to the SIOPEL pro-

tocols, the timing of OLT should allow the sparing of
some chemotherapy courses for the postsurgical
phase. To our knowledge to date, no study has evaluated the presenting features that predict unfeasible
resection and that favor prompt referral to a transplantation center and early listing for OLT. Our current study suggests that it is possible to determine at
presentation whether a child is likely to fail the
requirements for SR.
In this article, we report for the first time to our
knowledge that patients who failed conservative
treatment presented at an older age. According
to the ROC curve analysis, we observed that age
<3.2 years at presentation was associated with a 92%
probability of survival with the native liver. Reynolds
et al. reported an increased risk of HB among children of very low birth weight and suggested that the
etiology of HB may differ between children with very

low birth weight and children with normal birth
weight.19 It seems reasonable to speculate that HB
presenting later in life grows slowly, is discovered up
later, and has more aggressive features. This is supported by the course of disease of Patient 18, who
presented at age 12.5 years, had little shrinkage of
the mass, and was cleared from a recurrence very
long after OLT (8 years). Although our transplantation recipients had an overall good response to
chemotherapy, they had a significantly lower percentage of tumor shrinkage after chemotherapy compared with the other patients. It remains unclear
whether age at presentation has implications for the
pathobiology of different HB subtypes or simply
occurs by chance. Two patients in the current series
were diagnosed in adulthood: Although HB at that
age is unusual, some tumors do occur in adults and
can have features that are not observed in HB of
infancy.20–22 The histology of these 2 patients was
reviewed blindly, and the initial diagnoses were confirmed.
Most of our patients who had bilobar, multifocal
tumors at presentation remained unresectable thereafter, and none survived without OLT. Most
commonly, a multifocal tumor remains such after
chemotherapy despite shrinkage; however, when a
lobe appears to be cleared at imaging, it may not be
cleared microscopically. Indeed, one of our patients
(Patient 20) underwent a rescue OLT after the resection of a bilobar, multifocal mass that apparently
was rendered unilobar after chemotherapy. After
resection, the tumor recurred in the apparently
cleared lobe, and rescue liver transplantation did

not warrant the cure. Microscopic residual disease
may be observed in an apparently macroscopically
cleared explanted liver.23 Other previous studies also
suggested that multifocal tumors tend to recur after
resection,7,12,24 and this possibility should be considered the strongest predictor of the need for OLT in
patients with HB.
We have observed that patients who had very
low aFP levels at presentation were unresectable after preoperative treatment, because they had no
response to chemotherapy; and only patients who
underwent OLT survived. A recent SIOPEL study
demonstrated that patients with HB who presented
with an aFP level <100 ng/mL had a bad prognosis.25 The finding that this type of tumor does not
respond to chemotherapy may lead clinicians to consider surgery, either resection or transplantation, at
an early stage.
In some patients who undergo OLT for HB, the
tumor invades or is adjacent to the retrohepatic inferior vena cava (IVC), which has to be removed to
ensure complete excision of the mass. Because a left
split liver graft or a graft procured by living donation
has no IVC, a reconstruction of the recipient IVC often is needed.26 Caval replacement should be taken
into consideration when there is any suspicion of
IVC involvement.
OLT from living donors has been advocated for
patients with unresectable HB.27,28 In fact, it is questionable whether the exclusive use of cadaveric
donors will be sufficient to avoid the risk of delaying
surgery because of the unavailability of suitable
organs. Our study, in which we have identified pre-

Predictors of Unresectability in HB/D’Antiga et al.

dictors of unresectability in HB, may be of help in
suggesting that, for these patients, there should be
an early evaluation for living graft donation at a
transplantation center.
In the current series, only 4 patients had rapid
disease progression and could not undergo surgery,
including 1 patient who had had lung metastases at
diagnosis and 3 patients who had the appearance of
pulmonary spreading of disease during chemotherapy. The presence of lung metastases at diagnosis is
not an absolute contraindication to OLT, although
data on this group of patients are limited.29 In our
cohort, however, none of the patients at any disease
stage survived who had had evidence of tumor
spreading.
In conclusion, the results of the current study
suggest that it is possible to optimize the management of children with HB further taking into consideration their features at presentation. Red flags for
unresectability in our series were multifocality, a
high PRETEXT score, the involvement of major liver
vessels, an aFP level <100 ng/mL, and a late presentation after birth. These features should lead clinicians to liaise early with a transplantation center.
