BACKGROUND. Sequential tamoxifen/exemestane therapy reportedly improves disease-free survival in women with primary breast cancer compared with continued tamoxifen therapy. The objective of the current study was to assess the costeffectiveness of switching to exemestane after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen versus
continued tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer for a

total of 5 years of adjuvant therapy.

METHODS. A Markov model based on the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES)
population compared switching to exemestane versus continued tamoxifen for
2.5 years of therapy and 5 years of postadjuvant therapy follow-up. Disease progression and hazards ratios (HR) for recurrence and survival were determined
from datasets (IES and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program
of the National Cancer Institute) and from the published literature. An expert
panel validated treatment patterns, outcomes, and resource utilization. Direct
medical costs were included based on published sources. Cost-effectiveness
ratios were determined, and extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted.

RESULTS. Exemestane was found to be more effective than tamoxifen alone with
regard to disease-free survival (2.6% absolute improvement), life-years gained
(0.1028 LY), and quality-adjusted life-years gained (0.1195 QALY), at an additional
cost of Can$2889 per person over 7.5 years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
were Can$28,119/LY gained and Can$24,185/QALY gained. The model was most
sensitive to distant recurrence HR but was robust to variations in clinical, cost,
and utility parameters.

reast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women
worldwide, with more than 1 million new cases diagnosed every
year.1 Evidence from phase 3 clinical trials suggests that aromatase
inhibitors (AI) improve disease-free survival in patients with breast
cancer and reduce the occurrence of thromboembolic and gynecologic events compared with tamoxifen in patients with primary
breast cancer.2–7 In postmenopausal women with primary breast
cancer, a consistent improvement in clinical outcome has been
observed when AIs are used as adjuvant treatment.8 However, AIs

may increase the occurrence of musculoskeletal
events, including arthralgia, osteoporosis, and fractures.8
The Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES)6 demonstrated that switching to the AI exemestane after 2 to
3 years of tamoxifen significantly improved diseasefree survival compared with continuing tamoxifen for
a total of 5 years (hazards ratio [HR] of 0.68, 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 0.56–0.82 [P <.001]) in
postmenopausal women with resected unilateral
invasive breast cancer with estrogen receptor (ER)positive or unknown ER status. Based on these
results, Canadian treatment guidelines have recommended exemestane as a standard of care after 2 to
3 years of tamoxifen for a total of 5 years of hormone
therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.9 Due to the higher cost
of exemestane, a cost-effectiveness study was required
to evaluate costs versus benefits and potential risks.
The objective of the current study was to determine
the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility,
from a government payer perspective, of switching to
exemestane after tamoxifen therapy versus continuing
tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with primary
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
Incremental cost-effectiveness (cost per life-years
[LY] gained) and cost-utility (cost per qualityadjusted life-years [QALY] gained) analyses were conducted to compare switching to exemestane therapy
after 2.5 years of tamoxifen versus continued tamoxifen for a total of 5 years of hormonal therapy from a
Canadian provincial payer perspective. As recommended by economic evaluation guidelines,10 the
treatment comparator was the current standard of
care (adjuvant tamoxifen). Because women remain at
a high risk of cancer recurrence for up to 10 years
after initial diagnosis,11 outcomes were evaluated to
10 years after the initial diagnosis but excluded the
first 2.5 years of tamoxifen treatment that were common to both treatment comparators (total analysis of
7.5 years). The study was conducted from a Canadian public healthcare perspective. Costs and outcomes beyond 1 year were discounted at 5%.10
Population
The analysis used a hypothetical cohort of postmenopausal women from the IES population.6
Women were assumed to be age 64 years at the time
of model entry, and diagnosed with completely

resected unilateral invasive breast cancer with ERpositive disease or unknown ER status. At the time of
cohort entry, all women had received tamoxifen therapy (mean of 2.5 years) and had no evidence of
breast cancer recurrence. The model cohort was representative of a typical cohort of postmenopausal
women receiving tamoxifen for primary breast cancer in the Canadian setting with respect to age,
lymph node status, histologic type, hormone receptor
status, and the typical tamoxifen dose of 20 mg/day,
according to an expert panel. However, compared
with the IES population, fewer patients in Canada
generally undergo a mastectomy (30% vs 50% in
IES),12 whereas more patients would have received
adjuvant chemotherapy in Canada (approximately
50–60% of patients vs 32% in IES).

Model Overview and Assumptions
A Markov model with 6-month cycles (Fig. 1) was
created in TreeAge Pro 2005 (TreeAge, Williamson,
MA). The total time horizon was 7.5 years. Transition
states were disease free; discontinuation due to
adverse events (AEs); local, contralateral, and distant
recurrence; and death (from breast cancer or not
related to breast cancer [intercurrent death]). Disease
progression was assumed to occur at an average of 6
months after the diagnosis of distant recurrence.
Other clinical events including second primary nonbreast cancer, osteoporosis, fracture, hypercholesterolemia, thromboembolism, and cardiac ischemic
events were included in the model but were not considered as health states because they were assumed
to have no impact on AI therapy or subsequent
breast cancer-related treatments. For both treatment
strategies, after a treated local or contralateral recur-

rence, therapy was switched to another AI, letrozole,
although other scenarios were considered in the sensitivity analysis. It was assumed that AI therapy continued after the emergence of a second primary
nonbreast cancer, but was discontinued after distant
recurrence and the patient was treated appropriately
for the metastases (systemic chemotherapy/letrozole
hormonal therapy/palliative care). It was conservatively assumed that there was no additional recurrence benefit (no carryover effect) associated with
exemestane within 5 years after the completion of
the adjuvant therapy.
An expert panel of 4 Canadian oncologists validated the treatment patterns, outcomes, and
resource utilization used in this model.

Transition Probabilities
Discontinuation due to AEs
Probabilities for discontinuation due to AEs were
derived from an updated analysis of IES trial data
after a median follow-up of 40 months.13 The dropout rate due to AEs was 6.3% for exemestane treatment over 40.4 months, and was 5.2% for tamoxifen
treatment over 39.1 months (6-month probabilities
of .0094 and .0080, respectively).
Cancer recurrence
For the first 48 months, transition probabilities for
local, contralateral, and distant recurrence were
derived from an updated analysis of the published
IES data demonstrating fewer recurrences with exemestane than tamoxifen over a median follow-up of
32.8 months (local: 34 vs 43; contralateral: 8 vs 25;
and distant: 137 vs 197).6 Tamoxifen probabilities
were derived by determining event rates within each
6-month timeframe (Table 1). Exemestane recurrence
probabilities were obtained by multiplying tamoxifen
probabilities (Table 1) by HRs derived from KaplanMeier analyses over the duration of therapy in the

501

IES study (local HR of 0.76 [95% CI, 0.49–1.19]; contralateral HR of 0.32 [95% CI, 0.15–0.72]; and distant
HR of 0.70 [95% CI, 0.56–0.86]). Based on expert opinion, it was assumed that the rate of developing distant recurrence after a local or contralateral
recurrence was twice the rate reported in the IES for
those without a previous recurrence.
After 48 months, probabilities were extrapolated
from Kaplan-Meier curves of the IES data using linear regression based on historic data. To reflect lower
recurrence rates found by the Early Breast Cancer
Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) trial14 in the
5 years after the completion of adjuvant therapy, recurrence rates were reduced by 40% in that timeframe, and were assumed to be identical for
tamoxifen and exemestane (HR of 1.0).14
Surgery and chemotherapy costs associated with
an invasive and a noninvasive recurrence are different. Because local and contralateral recurrences
reported in the IES were not classified as invasive or
noninvasive, the proportions of invasive recurrences
found in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial7 were applied to this analysis.
As a consequence, 36.5% of local recurrences were
estimated to be invasive for both treatments, 90% of
contralateral recurrences were estimated to be invasive for tamoxifen, and 64% of local recurrences were
estimated to be invasive for exemestane.

Intercurrent death
Intercurrent death was defined as death not related
to breast cancer. In the first 48 months, probabilities
for intercurrent death (Table 1) were derived from
the IES dataset (59 deaths for exemestane vs 52
deaths for tamoxifen). The exemestane rate was
determined by multiplying the tamoxifen rate by the
HR for exemestane (HR of 0.93; 95% CI, 0.64–1.34).
After 48 months, age-adjusted, 6-month mortality

rates were based on age-standardized, all-cause mortality excluding breast cancer obtained from Statistics
Canada for women ages 68–71.5 years. This age
group was selected assuming that the age of women
starting the cohort was similar to those in the IES
trial (age 64 years), with death rates for ages 64 to 67
years taken from the IES trial.

Death related to breast cancer
Annual breast cancer-related mortality rates were not
available from the IES trial. Rates were based on
mortality data after local, contralateral, and distant
breast cancer recurrence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)15 registry database, a breast cancer database covering 26% of the
U.S. population (1991–2002), with the assumption
that mortality rates after recurrence are similar in
Canada and the U.S. (Table 2).
Adverse Events
AEs were extracted from the Canadian exemestane
product monograph13 and IES trial publication.6 Criteria for including an AE in the model were based on
the following: a cumulative incidence [1%, a significant difference between exemestane and tamoxifen
(P  .05)6 or clinically important differences determined from the product monograph,13 and a suspected significant impact on treatment costs. Based
on these criteria, osteoporosis, fractures, hypercholesterolemia, thromboembolism, and cardiac events
were included. All thromboembolic events were considered to be deep vein thromboses. Other AEs were
excluded from the model unless symptoms were
severe enough to require discontinuation and were
captured in the discontinuation due to AE health
state.
Compared with tamoxifen, exemestane was associated with a higher rate of osteoporosis (5.2% vs
2.9%), fractures (4.2% vs 3.1%), hypercholesterolemia
(3.5% vs 1.9%), and cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, angina, and myocardial ischemia
(2.1% vs 1.2%).13 Tamoxifen was associated with a
higher rate of thromboembolism (2.4% vs 1.0%).13
The 6-month AE rates were obtained by dividing the
overall proportion of patients with the event by the
median follow-up time per drug (40.4 months for
exemestane and 39.1 months for tamoxifen) and
multiplying by 6 months.
Breast Cancer Utilities
Utilities for recurrences, terminal-stage cancer, and
second primary nonbreast cancer were obtained
from a number of published sources. Assumptions
were made for missing data (Table 2). Recurrence-

related utility inputs were based on a study using a
standard gamble technique with U.S. and U.K.
women ages 55 to 70 years with breast cancer.16 Disease-free survival had a utility of 0.959, regardless of
therapy and remission time after recurrence. Utility
of distant recurrence was 0.432, assuming that most
patients received chemotherapy. Terminal-stage utility (0.288) was based on a study using a time tradeoff technique.17 Disutility of second primary nonbreast cancer (20.109) was obtained from Weinstein
and Schiff.18

Resource Utilization and Cost
Resource utilization was based on IES data6 and
expert panel (Table 2). Only direct medical costs
were included, in 2004 Canadian dollars (Can$1 5
U.S.$0.85 for the week of January 15–19 2007). Non2004 costs were inflated to 2004 using the medical
component of the Canadian Consumer Price Index.19
The frequency of recurrence events was determined from the IES trial and the costs of the recurrences were determined from published sources.20–26
In those patients without a recurrence (disease-free
survival) costs included follow-up visit, medical tests,
and bone mineral density scan based on expert
panel. To monitor bone density loss, we assumed
that the bone mineral density scan was conducted
every 2 years with tamoxifen treatment and yearly
with exemestane treatment based on expert opinion.
Costs for AI-related AEs, breast cancer recurrence,
second primary nonbreast cancer, and death are
summarized in Table 2.
For AEs, the costs were those of alendronate
treatment for osteoporosis (intermediate cost compared with etidronate and residronate),27 atorvastatin
treatment for hypercholesterolemia (the most commonly prescribed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor in Canada),27
outpatient low-molecular-weight heparin for deep
vein thrombosis (thromboembolism),28 acute myocardial infarction as a proxy for cardiac ischemic events,29
and published estimates for fractures.24 It was assumed
that patients discontinuing therapy due to AEs had 1
extra physician visit to monitor AEs at an additional
cost of Can$89.
Analyses
The incremental cost per LY gained and cost per
QALY gained were determined for tamoxifen versus
exemestane. One-way sensitivity analyses for clinical
inputs, utilities, and costs were varied from their
base case value over clinically relevant ranges. HRs
were varied over their 95% CIs. Costs were varied by
50% to 150% of base case values, except for the cost

cost-effectiveness ratios as determined by 1-way sensitivity analyses.

RESULTS
Base Case Results
Five years after the completion of adjuvant therapy
(total of 7.5 years), the model predicted that switching to exemestane increased the disease-free survival
by an absolute 2.6% over continuing treatment with
tamoxifen (80.9% vs 78.3%). Discounted LYs gained
were found to be greater with exemestane (Table 3),
with an increment of 0.1028 years over tamoxifen.
Exemestane therapy increased the total discounted
medical costs by Can$2889 per patient over 7.5 years.
Discounted incremental costs per patient included
Can$4099 for medication, Can$565 for medical care
associated with disease-free survival, and Can$126

for AEs. Cost savings were generated for reduced
cancer recurrences (Can$1680) and other cancers
(Can$221) per person in the exemestane group. The
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for exemestane was Can$28,119 per LY gained.
Exemestane increased QALYs by 0.1195, resulting
in an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of
Can$24,185 per QALY (Table 3).

Sensitivity Analyses
Varying the probabilities for different outcomes
resulted in a range of ICERs from Can$13,081 to
Can$55,606 per LY gained, and a range of ICURs
from Can$10,774 to Can$49,089 per QALY gained. No
threshold values were found. Variations of [10% of
the base case are reported in Figure 2. Incremental
ratios demonstrated the greatest range with variations
in HR for distant recurrence (Can$16,574–55,606 per LY
and Can$14,102–49,089 per QALY), followed by HR
intercurrent death (Can$22,195–45,853 per LY and
Can$19,919–35,065 per QALY), disease recurrence after
treatment (Can$13,081–28,119 per LY and Can$10,774–
24,185 per QALY), and local recurrence (Can$25,525–
33,066 per LY and Can$22,111–28,059 per QALY).
Varying the cost of exemestane also was found to have
considerable impact on the ICER and ICUR
(Can$4723–43,716 per LY and Can$4063–37,600 per
QALY). Incremental results also demonstrated a 10%
change from the base case when varying the cost for

distant recurrence (Can$23,677–32,543 per LY and
Can$20,364–27,990 per QALY) and disease-free survival
utility (Can$22,850–$33,580 per QALY). The model was
robust to variations with regard to other clinical, cost,
and utility parameters.
Two-way sensitivity analyses for selected parameters resulted in ICUR variations between Can$9925
and Can$71,137 per QALY. When both the cost of
distant recurrence with disease progression (95% CI,
50–150%) and the probability of distant recurrence
(95% CI, 0.56–0.86) were varied, ICURs ranged from
Can$9925 to Can$52,016 per QALY. Varying the disease-free survival utility with exemestane probabil-

ities for posttreatment disease recurrence, distant
recurrence, or intercurrent death produced ICURs of
Can$9973 to Can$33,579 per QALY, Can$13,358 to
Can$71,137 per QALY, and Can$18,882 to Can$51,631
per QALY, respectively.

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study demonstrated that
switching from tamoxifen to exemestane was more
effective than continued tamoxifen treatment with
regard to disease-free survival (12.6%), LYs gained
(10.1028 years), and QALYs gained (10.1195 years),

at an additional cost of Can$2889 per person over 7.5
years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the
base case were Can$28,119 per LY gained and
Can$24,185 per QALY, indicating that switching to
exemestane after 2.5 years of tamoxifen treatment is
cost-effective, all by conservatively assuming there
was no carryover effect of exemestane in the 5 years
after the discontinuation of adjuvant therapy.
The type, timing, and sequencing of hormonal
therapy are critical decisions to be made by oncologists when treating patients with breast cancer. The
clinical benefits of switching to exemestane observed
in the IES6 and modeled over 7.5 years translated
into partial cost offset of the higher cost of exemestane. Exemestane prevented breast cancer and other
cancer recurrences, resulting in savings of Can$1901
over 7.5 years compared with continued tamoxifen
treatment. Despite the increased risk of osteoporosis
with exemestane, all AEs resulted in a modest cost
increment of Can$126. The ICUR generated for exemestane was well below the commonly accepted
thresholds of Can$50,000 per QALY in Canada.33
Other economic evaluations in Canada, the U.S.,
and the U.K. have consistently reported that AI
strategies are cost-effective in the adjuvant treatment
of early breast cancer, with ICURs below the widely
accepted country-specific cost-effectiveness thresholds (\U.S.$50,000 per QALY, and \U.K.£20,000).8,34–40
A recent Canadian analysis of the ATAC trial over a
lifetime horizon reported that 5 years of anastrozole
monotherapy compared with 5 years of tamoxifen
resulted in an ICUR of Can$28,000 per QALY, assuming a constant reduction of recurrences with anastrozole for up to 10 years.38 Another Canadian study
that compared anastrozole with sequential tamoxifen/exemestane therapy assuming a carryover benefit
of 5 years found that switching to exemestane was
more cost-effective than continuing treatment with
anastrozole (ICUR of Can$7683).39 Based on the
ATAC, MA-17, and IES trials, a European analysis
concluded that sequential tamoxifen/exemestane
therapy provided a significantly lower ICUR compared with anastrozole monotherapy or extended
letrozole therapy (\U.S.$40,000 for a patients aged
65 years).36 Finally, exemestane was associated with
an ICER of U.K.£19,170 per QALY in a British analysis
assuming no carryover benefit.37 After this study, the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(NICE) recommended sequential tamoxifen/exemestane as an alternative treatment of postmenopausal
women with primary ER-positive invasive breast cancer.37 Consistent with previous findings, the results
of the current study support the cost-effectiveness of
exemestane (ICUR of Can$24,185 per QALY), with

the conservative assumption of a 2.5-year treatment
effect with no carryover benefit, suggesting that the
benefits of exemestane may have been underestimated. Our alternate analysis including this carryover
effect (25% reduction in disease recurrence in the 5
years after adjuvant therapy based on extrapolation
of the IES dataset) resulted in an ICER and ICUR of
Can$13,081 per LY and Can$10,774 per QALY gained,
respectively.
It is interesting to note that the daily cost disparity between tamoxifen and exemestane used in the
current analysis is wider than it appears to be in the
U.S. In Canada, the daily cost of exemestane is
approximately 14 times higher than generic tamoxifen, whereas in the U.S., the cost disparity is 3 times
higher than brandname tamoxifen and 6 times
higher than generic tamoxifen. Therefore, in the U.S.,
the incremental treatment cost per person may be
less than in Canada, making treatment with exemestane even more favorable.
Most cost-effective models included endometrial
cancer, thromboembolism, and fractures,37–39 in addition to ischemic cerebrovascular disorders37,38 and
vaginal bleeding.37,39 A number of drug-related AEs
were included in the current study based on incidence, clinical significance, potential cost impact,
and the availability of data.13 They translated into
only modest cost increments (Can$126) for exemestane over tamoxifen. Due to the absence of sufficient
resource utilization data in the IES trial, costs for gynecologic symptoms for tamoxifen were not
included. Their exclusion, despite an increased number of gynecologic interventions reported in patients
who were treated with tamoxifen in the ATAC trial,41
biases the analysis against exemestane.
The results of the current study should be considered in light of the possible limitations of the
model. The current analysis was based on data from
a clinical trial, which may not reflect real-world practice. However, modeled treatment patterns and resource utilization were validated by an expert panel.
The hypothetical model cohort, based on the IES
population,6 may differ from the Canadian population. It is estimated that approximately 50% to 60%
of patients would have received adjuvant chemotherapy in Canada, compared with 32% reported in the
IES population; fewer patients (30%) in Canada generally undergo a mastectomy, compared with 50%
reported in the IES.12 Data from beyond the duration
of the clinical trial were extrapolated in the model.
There were limited data regarding specific parameters such as distant recurrence rates after local invasive recurrences or treating patients after disease
recurrence while they were receiving an AI. Assumptions

Cost-effectiveness of Exemestane/Risebrough et al.

were made (which generally were conservative and in
favor of the least expensive treatment, tamoxifen), and
sensitivity analyses revealed that sequential tamoxifen/
exemestane therapy continued to be cost-effective
(\Can$50,000 per QALY) under most conditions.
The current study model, based on a conservative approach, suggests that sequential tamoxifen/
exemestane therapy is a cost-effective treatment for
postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer.
This study reinforces the recent recommendations in
Canada to fund the sequential use of tamoxifen/exemestane as a standard of care for postmenopausal
women with ER-positive breast cancer or breast cancer of unknown ER status.
