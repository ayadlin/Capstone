Macrophages play critical, but opposite roles, in acute and chronic inflammation and
cancer1–5. In response to pathogens or injury, inflammatory macrophages express cytokines
that stimulate cytotoxic T cells, while highly abundant macrophages in neoplastic and
parasitic diseases express anti-inflammatory cytokines that induce immune suppression and
may promote resistance to T cell checkpoint inhibitors1–7. Here we show that macrophage
PI(3)Kinase γ controls a critical switch between immune stimulation and suppression during
inflammation and cancer. PI3Kγ signaling through Akt and mTor inhibits NFκB activation
while stimulating C/EBPβ activation, thereby inducing a transcriptional program that

promotes immune suppression during inflammation and tumor growth. In contrast, selective
inactivation of macrophage PI3Kγ stimulates and prolongs NFκB activation and inhibits C/
EBPβ activation, thus promoting an immunostimulatory transcriptional program that
restores CD8+ T cell activation and cytotoxicity and synergizes with checkpoint inhibitor
therapy to promote tumor regression and extend survival in mouse models of cancer. As
PI3Kγ-directed, anti-inflammatory gene expression predicted survival probability in cancer
patients, our findings demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of intracellular signaling
pathways that regulate the switch between macrophage polarization states can control
immune suppression in cancer and other disorders.

We investigated the association between immune responses and survival in primary tumors
from HPV+ (n=97) and HPV− (n=423) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
cohorts from TCGA.8 High expression levels of pro-inflammatory mRNAs IL12A, IL12B,
IFNG, and CD8A were associated with increased survival in HPV+ but not HPV− cohorts,
while high expression of IL6 was negatively associated with survival (Extended Data Fig.
1a–e). HPV+ patients with this favorable immune expression profile (n=35) had 97%
survival at 3 years compared with 57% survival for patients without this profile (n=62) (Fig.
1a). Similar associations were observed in lung adenocarcinoma and gastric carcinoma
patients (Extended Data Fig. 1f–g). These results suggested that therapeutic approaches that
stimulate pro-inflammatory gene expression might enhance cancer patient survival.

We suspected that macrophage signaling pathways, such as those regulated by Class IB
isoform PI3Kγ, might control the switch between immune stimulation and suppression in
inflammation and cancer. PI3Kγ is abundantly expressed in myeloid but not cancer cells
(Extended Data Fig. 1h)9–12 and promotes myeloid cell trafficking during inflammation and
cancer11–15. Mice lacking PI3Kγ (p110γ−/−) mounted exaggerated, macrophage-mediated
pro-inflammatory responses upon exposure to pathogenic stimuli (Fig. 1b; Extended Data
Fig. 1i–k), suggesting that PI3Kγ inhibits macrophage inflammatory responses and might
do so in the tumor microenvironment. Mice lacking PI3Kγ and mice that were treated with
PI3Kγ antagonists (TG100–11512 or IPI-54916) exhibited significantly suppressed growth of
implanted HPV+ (MEER) and HPV− (SCCVII) HNSCC, lung carcinoma (LLC), and breast
carcinoma (PyMT) tumors (Fig. 1c). PI3Kγ inhibition did not directly affect the growth or
survival of tumor cells, which do not express the kinase (Extended Data Fig. 1h, 1l–m)12–15.
PI3Kγ inhibition suppressed long-term growth and metastases of spontaneous breast tumors,
extended survival of mice with orthotopic breast tumors and enhanced the sensitivity of
tumors to the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine (Fig. 1d; Extended Data Fig. 1n–q). While
PI3Kγ inhibition did not affect the accumulation of CD11b+Gr1-F4/80+ tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) in tumors (Extended Data Fig. 2a–f), it enhanced expression of
MHCII and pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibited expression of immune suppressive
factors in tumors and TAMs, indicating that PI3Kγ controls the TAM switch between
immune suppression and immune stimulation (Fig.1e–g Extended Data Fig. 2g–j, 3a–f).
To determine whether PI3Kγ directly regulates macrophage polarization, we analyzed
mRNA and protein expression in primary murine macrophages stimulated in vitro with basal
(CSF-1), pro-inflammatory (IFNγ/LPS + CSF-1) or anti-inflammatory (IL-4 + CSF-1)
conditions. Pro-inflammatory stimuli upregulate macrophage expression of innate immune

proteins, cytokines and cell surface receptors, while anti-inflammatory stimuli induces
expression of immunosuppressive factors similar to those expressed in TAMs (Extended
Data Fig. 4a–c)1. Genes and proteins associated with immune activation, antigenpresentation and T cell activation were upregulated In p110γ−/− and PI3Kγ inhibitortreated macrophages (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Fig. 4c–f, 5a–g). In contrast, genes
associated with immune suppression and chemoattraction were inhibited (Fig. 2a–c,
Extended Data Fig. 4c–f, 5a–g). These results confirm that PI3Kγ controls a macrophage
switch between immune stimulation and suppression.

To identify how PI3Kγ regulates macrophage immune responses, we evaluated DNA
binding activities of NFκB p65 RelA and the C/CAAT enhancer binding protein C/EBPβ in
WT and p110γ null macrophages, as NFκB promotes expression of inflammatory
cytokines17, while C/EBPβ promotes expression of the immunosuppressive factor
Arg1.18–19 PI3Kγ ablation rapidly and sustainably stimulated RelA DNA binding activity in
macrophages (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 5h). In contrast, PI3Kγ ablation suppressed DNA
binding activity of C/EBPβ (Fig. 2e). Consistent with these findings, PI3Kγ inhibition
stimulated and sustained p65 RelA phosphorylation and simultaneously inhibited C/EBPβ
and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2f–g, Extended Data Fig. 6a–b).

Author Manuscript

We next examined the effect of PI3Kγ inhibition on the stability and phosphorylation of
proteins that activate NFκB, including the TLR4-associated adaptor protein IRAK-1 and
inhibitory kappa B kinase β, IKKβ, which promotes degradation of IκBα, with subsequent
release of NFκB from an inhibitory IκB-NFκB complex17. PI3Kγ deletion enhanced
phosphorylation of IKKβ and TBK1 and degradation of IRAK-1 and IκBα in LPSstimulated p110γ−/− macrophages (Fig. 2h). As an IKKβ inhibitor suppressed the
inflammatory phenotype observed in p110γ−/− macrophages (Fig. 2i), these results indicate
PI3Kγ is both a feedback inhibitor of the TLR4-NFκB activation pathway and a promoter of
IL-4 and C/EBPβ signaling.
C/EBPβ has been previously linked with tumor immune suppression through its control of
Arg-1 expression18–19. Expression of constitutively activated PI3Kγ (p110γCAAX)11 was
sufficient to induce Arg-1 expression, in a manner that was inhibited by Cebpb, Mtor, or
S6ka knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 6c–d). Cebpb knockdown as well as inhibitors of S6K
and mTOR suppressed expression of immune suppressive factors and stimulated expression
of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Extended Data Fig. 6e–g). These results show that PI3Kγ
promotes immune suppression by activating mTor-S6Kα-C/EBPβ and inhibiting NFκB,
thereby controlling a switch that regulates the balance between immune suppression and
stimulation.

Since PI3Kγ blockade stimulates pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages, we asked
whether macrophage PI3Kγ blockade promotes adaptive immunity. TAMs were isolated
from WT and p110γ−/− tumors, mixed with tumor cells and adoptively transferred into new
WT or p110γ−/− recipient mice (Fig. 3a). Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in
tumors containing p110γ−/− TAMs but not WT TAMs (Fig. 3b). CD8+ T cells were
significantly increased in tumors with p110γ−/− but not WT macrophages (Fig. 3c,
Extended Data Fig. 6h), indicating that PI3Kγ signaling in TAMs inhibits CD8+ T cell

recruitment to tumors. To determine whether macrophage-derived cytokines control tumor
growth, we implanted tumor cells mixed with in vitro cultured macrophages or conditioned
medium (CM) into WT mice. Tumor growth was enhanced by IL-4 stimulated WT
macrophages and CM but inhibited by IL-4 stimulated p110γ−/− macrophages and CM
from p110γ−/− or PI3Kγ inhibitor-treated macrophages and by all LPS-stimulated
macrophages and CM (Fig. 3d–e). To determine which macrophage-derived immune factors
affect tumor growth in vivo, we treated WT and p110γ−/− TAMs ex vivo with inhibitors of
mTor, Arginase, IKKβ, IL-12 or NOS2 prior to mixing with tumor cells and implanting in
mice (Extended Data Fig. 6i). Blockade of mTOR or Arginase in WT macrophages
suppressed tumor growth, while inhibition of NOS2, IL-12 or IKKβ in p110γ−/−
macrophages stimulated tumor growth. These results indicate that PI3Kγ-mTOR mediated
immune suppression promotes tumor growth and that PI3Kγ inhibition reverses these effects
by shifting macrophages toward NFκβ-dependent pro-inflammatory polarization.

Author Manuscript

To confirm that macrophage PI3Kγ controls tumor growth, mice bearing pre-established
tumors were treated with PI3Kγ inhibitors in combination with clodronate liposomes, which
deplete macrophages from tissues.20 PI3Kγ inhibitor and clodronate liposome treatment
each partially inhibited tumor growth and stimulated T cell recruitment, but the combination
had no additive effects, confirming that PI3Kγ in macrophages, rather than other cell types,
promotes tumor growth (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d). Similar results were noted when CSF1R
inhibition21 and PI3Kγ inhibition were combined (Extended Data Fig. 7e–f).

PI3Kγ blockade stimulated T cell recruitment into tumors, as total and CD8+ T cell content
increased in tumors from p110γ−/− mice without significantly altering systemic T cell
content (Fig. 3f; Extended Data Fig. 7g–i). PI3Kγ inhibition did not suppress tumor growth
in CD8 null or antibody-depleted mice, suggesting PI3Kγ inhibition blocks tumor growth by
recruiting and/or activating CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 7j–k). When T cells
were isolated from tumor-bearing or naive animals, mixed with tumor cells and implanted in
mice, only T cells from p110γ−/− tumor-bearing animals suppressed tumor growth (Fig.
3h). However, PI3Kγ inhibition did not directly activate T cells, as neither PI3Kγ deletion
nor treatment of T cells with PI3Kγ inhibitors ex vivo affected T cell proliferation or
activation; in contrast, PI3Kδ inhibition suppressed T cell activation in vitro and promoted
tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 3i; Extended Data Fig. 7l–m, 8a–b). PI3Kγ inhibition promoted
T cell mediated cytotoxicity, as T cells isolated from p110γ−/− or PI3Kγ inhibitor-treated
tumors stimulated tumor cell cytotoxicity (Extended Data Fig. 8c–g). T cells from p110γ−/−
or PI3Kγ inhibitor-treated animals expressed significantly more IFNγ and Granzyme B and
significantly less TGFβ1 and IL10 protein and mRNA than T cells from WT animals (Fig.
3j; Extended Data Fig. 8h–l). Together, these results indicate that macrophage PI3Kγ
inhibition indirectly promotes both Th1 and cytotoxic adaptive immune responses.
To determine whether PI3Kγ inhibition interacts with other immune therapies, we combined
PI3Kγ and the checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1 in mouse tumor models. PD-L1, but not PDL2, was expressed on macrophages in vitro and in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 9a–b). PI3Kγ
inhibition synergized with anti-PD-1 to suppress the growth of HPV+ HNSCC tumors in
p110γ−/− or inhibitor-treated male or female animals, inducing tumor regression in 86% of
male and 90–100% of female animals, as well as continuous survival to date in 60% of male

mice and 90–100% of female mice (Fig. 4a–c, Extended Data Fig. 9c–d). Importantly,
PI3Kγ inhibition also synergized with anti-PD-1 to reduce tumor growth, extending survival
and inducing tumor regression in 30% of mice bearing HPV− HNSCC (SCCVII) tumors
(Fig. 4d–f, Extended Data Fig. 9e). The combination of PI3Kγ and anti-PD-1 inhibitors
activated T cell memory, as 100% of mice that had previously cleared HPV+ tumors
efficiently suppressed re-challenge with HPV+ tumor cells and remained cancer free
(Extended Data Fig. 9f). PI3Kγ and PD-1 inhibitors each stimulated immune response gene
expression and inhibited immune suppressive gene expression, MHCII expression in TAMs,
and CD8+ T cell recruitment to tumors; combination therapy further elevated these
parameters (Fig. 4g–i, Extended Data Fig. 9g). These studies show that PI3Kγ inhibition can
synergize with T cell targeted therapy to promote anti-tumor immune responses that induce
sustained tumor regression in murine models of cancer.

Author Manuscript

PI3Kγ-regulated immune responses might also affect outcome in cancer patients. We
identified 43 PI3Kγ-regulated genes that significantly associated with survival in TCGA
HPV+ HNSCC patients (Fig. 5j). HPV+ HNSCC patients with a low PI3Kγ activity profile
experienced 100% survival at 3 years, compared with 56% survival for the remaining 63
patients (Fig. 5k). In HPV− HNSCC patients, 39 of these genes were significantly shifted in
the direction of high PI3Kγ activity, consistent with a pattern of pervasive immune
suppression and reduced survival in HPV− disease (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In lung
adenocarcinoma patients, 18 genes predicted survival; patients with a low PI3Kγ activity
profile had 73% survival at 3 years, compared with 55% survival for others (Figure 5l).
These results suggest that a PI3Kγ-regulated immune suppression signature is associated
with survival in cancer patients and that PI3Kγ inhibitors might provide clinical benefit in
cancer patients.

Author Manuscript

Here we have shown that PI3Kγ regulates innate immunity during inflammation and cancer
(Extended Data Fig.10b–c). Prior studies have implicated PI3Ks in the regulation of proinflammatory immune responses in macrophages, as pan-PI3K inhibitors and null mutations
in the PI3Kγ effectors PDK1, Akt1 and TSC enhanced pro-inflammatory NFκB dependent
transcription in macrophages,22–24 while inhibition of PTEN and SHIP, which oppose
PI3Kinase function, promotes immune suppression.25–26 As macrophage reprogramming
can enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer5,13,21,27, our studies indicate that
inhibitory targeting of macrophage signaling pathways may provide novel approaches to
improve the long-term survival of cancer patients.

Immune-related gene expression signature analysis in TCGA data
We analyzed TCGA data for association between mRNA expression level of sixteen
candidate immune-related genes (ARG1, IL10, FOXP3, CD68, IL12A, IL12B, IFNG,
CD8A, CD4, CD11B, CD14, TNFA, IL1A, IL1B, IL6 and CCL5) and 5-year overall
survival. Illumina HiSeq RNAseqV2 mRNA expression and clinical data for 520 Head and
Neck squamous cell carcinoma samples were downloaded from the TCGA data portal.
Median follow-up from diagnosis was 1.8 years with range 0.01 years to 17.6 years. Followup time was truncated at 5-years for analysis and 200 deaths occurred in this period. For

each of the 16 candidate immune response genes, we scored subjects as above (high) or
below (low) the median expression and compared survival using a log rank test at 5%
significance. HPV+ patients were stratified into a favorable immune profile if they had
expression above the median for the significant genes IL12A, IL12B IFNG, CD8A and
below the median for IL6. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted for these two groups. Similar
methods were used to examine association of these 16 genes with 720 lung adenocarcinoma,
and 876 gastric carcinoma samples using the publically available data from KM Plotter28. In
lung adenocarcinoma, 12 genes were significantly associated with survival; patients were
scored as having a favorable immune profile if 7 or more of the 12 significant genes had
expression in the favorable direction. In 876 gastric cancer samples, 8 genes were
significantly associated with survival. patients were scored as having a favorable immune
profile if 5 out of the 8 genes had expression in the favorable direction.

PI3Kγ−regulated gene expression signature analysis in TCGA data

Author Manuscript

We investigated 66 immune-related genes in four functional classes (17 genes related to
antigen presentation (HLA class I and II molecules), 24 genes surveying T cell activation, 20
innate immune response genes (IL6, CCL7 and others), and 5 genes related to cancer cell
signaling) that changed expression in response to PI3Kγ inhibition for association with
survival in HPV+ and HPV− TCGA HNSCC and lung adenocarcinoma cohorts. Within each
cancer type, we scored subjects as above or below the median expression for each gene and
compared survival using a log rank test, using 10% FDR within each class as the
significance threshold. HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC survival were investigated separately, as
HPV− HNSCC has generally worse prognosis. Within each cohort, patients were classified
as having a favorable PI3Kγ immune response profile if they had expression levels above or
below the median in the direction of low PI3Kγ activity for the genes identified as
significant. We compared the survival experience of favorable vs less-favorable patients
using Kaplan-Meier curves.
Out of the 66 experimentally identified PI3Kγ regulated genes 43 showed significant
association with overall survival in the HPV+ cohort (FDR<10% within each functional
class). Comparison of these genes between HPV+ and HPV− cohort showed that HPV−
samples generally had significantly (p<0.05) lower expression of 42 genes in the antigen
presentation and T cell activation classes, consistent with a pattern of adaptive immune
suppression, and higher expression of genes in the innate immune response and cancer cell
signaling class, which were negatively associated with survival. Only Malt1 was not
differentially expressed between the two groups (p=0.7).

Wildtype or p110γ−/− 6–8 week-old female or male syngeneic C57Bl/6J (LLC lung, PyMT
breast, and MEER HPV+ HNSCC) or C3He/J (SSCVII HPV− HNSCC) mice were
implanted with 1×106 tumor cells by subcutaneous injection (LLC, MEER, SCCVII) or by
orthotopic injection (PyMT) (n=10–15) and tumor growth was monitored for up to 30 days.
Tumor dimensions were measured once when tumors were palpable. Tumor volumes were
calculated using the equation (l2 x w)/2. In some studies, WT and p110γ−/− animals with
LLC tumors were treated with gemcitabine (150 mg/kg) or saline by i.p injection on d7 and
d14 (n=10). LLC were acquired from ATCC, PyMT were from Lesley Ellies (University of
California, San Diego), HPV+ MEER were from John Lee (Cancer Biology Research
Center, Sanford Research/USD, Sioux Falls, SD) and SCCVII squamous carcinoma cells
were from Stephen Schoenberger (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology). All cell
lines were tested for mycoplasma and mouse pathogens and checked for authenticity against
the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC; http://iclac.org/databases/

In some studies, mice bearing LLC, PyMT, HPV+ MEER or HPV− HNSCC tumor cells
were treated once daily by oral gavage with vehicle (5%NMP/95% PEG 400), 15mg/kg/day
of the PI3Kγ inhibitor IPI-549 or by i.p. injection with 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d of TG100–1159,43
beginning on day 8 post-tumor injection and continuing daily until sacrifice. IPI-549 is an
orally bioavailable PI3Kγ inhibitor with a long plasma half-life and a KD value of 0.29 nM
for PI3Kγ with >58-fold weaker binding affinity for the other Class I PI3K isoforms26.
Enzymatic and cellular assays confirmed the selectivity of IPI-549 for PI3Kγ (>200-fold in
enzymatic assays and >140-fold in cellular assays over other Class I PI3K isoforms26. To
study the effect of IPI-549 on lung tumor growth, LLC tumor cells were passaged three
times in C57/BL6 Albino male mice. When tumor volume reached 1500 mm3, tumors were
harvested and single-cell suspensions were prepared. This tumor brei inoculum was
implanted subcutaneously in the hind flank of C57/BL6 Albino male mice at 1×106 cells/
mouse. Prior to initiating treatment with once daily IPI-549 (15 mg/kg p.o.), groups were
normalized on the basis of tumor volume. In some studies, WT and p110γ−/− tumor-bearing
mice were treated with 100μg of anti-CD8 (clone YTS 169.4) or isotype control clone
(LTF-2) from BioXCell administered by i.p. injections on day 7, 10 and 13 of tumor growth.
For all tumor experiments, tumor volumes and weights were recorded at sacrifice.

C57Bl/6J (wildtype) or p110γ−/− 6–8 week-old male or female mice (MEER HPV+
HNSCC) or C3He/J (SCCVII HPV− HNSCC) were implanted with tumor cells by
subcutaneous injection (1 × 106 MEER or 1 × 105 SCCVII). In HPV+ MEER studies,
wildtype and p110γ−/− animals were treated with 4 doses of 250 μg of anti-PD-1 antibody
(Clone RMP-14, Bioxcell) or Rat IgG2a isotype control (Clone2A3, Bioxcell) every 3 days
starting when tumors became palpable on day 11 (n = 12–14 mice per group). Wildtype
mice bearing HPV+ tumors were also treated with the p110γ inhibitor TG100–11543 b.i.d.
by i.p. injection, beginning on day 11. Tumor regressions were calculated as a percentage of
the difference in tumor volume between the date treatment was initiated and the first date of
sacrifice of the control group. For HPV-SCCVII studies, C3He/J mice were treated with

with a combination of the two. Alternatively, mice were treated with 5mg/kg TG100–115
b.i.d. +/− anti-PD-1 (250μg every 3 days) beginning on day 1 (Figure 4). Mice that
completely cleared HPV+ MEER tumors were re-injected with HPV+ tumor cells
contralateral to the initial tumor injection and tumor growth was monitored.
PyMT models of mammary carcinoma

Author Manuscript

The growth and metastasis of spontaneous mammary tumors in female PyMT+ (n=13) and
p110γ−/− PyMT+ (n=8) animals was evaluated over the course of 0–15 weeks. Total tumor
burden was determined by subtracting the total mammary gland mass in PyMT− animals
from the total mammary gland mass in PyMT+ animals. Lung metastases were quantified
macroscopically and microscopically in H&E tissue sections at week 15.
LPS induced septic shock
Septic shock was induced in WT and p110γ−/− mice via intraperitoneal injection of 25
mg/kg LPS (Sigma, B5:005). Survival was monitored every 12h and liver, bone marrow and
serum were collected 24h post LPS injection.

with 1 mg/mouse clodronate or control liposomes (Clodronateliposomes.com, Amsterdam,
The Netherlands) every 4 days for 2 weeks in combination with daily administration of
vehicle or IPI-549 (15 mg/kg/day p.o.). In other studies, six week old female BALB/c mice
were injected subcutaneously with 2.5×105 CT26 murine colon carcinoma cells in 100μl
PBS into the right flank. Eight days later, tumor-bearing mice were arranged into four
groups (n=15) with an average tumor volume of 70mm3. Oral administration of IPI-549
(15mg/kg) or Vehicle (5%NMP/95% PEG 400) and anti-CSF-1R antibody (50mg/kg i.p. 3×

tumor-bearing animals were grouped and treated with IPI-549 (15 mg/kg, QD, PO) or
Vehicle (5%NMP/95% PEG 400). In addition, mice were injected i.p. with 50mg/kg antiCD115 (BioXcell Clone: AFS98 Cat: BE0213) or 50mg/kg rat IgG2a isotype control
(BioXcell Clone: 2A3 Cat: BE0089-R005) antibodies as described above for a total of three
injections. Two days after the final injection animals were euthanized, tumors were digested
in a mixture of 0.5 mg/ml Collagenase IV and 150 U/ml DNAse I in RPMI-1640 for 30
minutes at 37°C, and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.

min prior to the addition of tumor cells. Mice were additionally treated intradermally with
5μg of antibody 3 and 6 days after tumor cell inoculation. In some studies, CD11b+Gr1−
cells were pre-incubated with inhibitors of Arginase (nor-NOHA, 50 μM, Cayman
Chemical), iNOS (1400W dihydrocholoride, 100 μM, Tocris), mTOR (rapamycin, 10 μM
Calbiochem), or IKKβ (ML120B, 30 μM, Tocris) for 30 min before the addition of tumor
cells. Inoculated mice were further treated by intradermal injection with inhibitors at 3 and 6
days post inoculation.

Isolation of single cells from murine tumors

Donor C57Bl/6J (wildtype) or p110γ−/− mice were implanted with 1 × 106 LLC tumor cells
by subcutaneous injection. On day 14 after tumor implantation, CD90.2+, CD4+ or CD8+
cells were harvested by magnetic bead isolation (Miltenyi Biotec). T cells were mixed 1:1
with viable LLC tumor cells. Cell mixtures containing 5 × 105 total cells were injected into
the flanks of naïve WT or p110γ−/− mice (n=8–10 per group). Tumor growth, intratumoral
apoptosis and necrosis were investigated over 0–16 days. In other studies, WT T cells were
incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 6h with 10 or 100 nM IPI-549 (Infinity Pharmaceuticals) or
Cal-101 (Selleck Chem). After 6h, T cells were washed, admixed 1:1 with LLC tumor cells,
and 1 × 106 total cells were injected subcutaneously into recipient mice. Tumor growth, was
monitored for 14 days.

Tumors were isolated, minced in a petri dish on ice and then enzymatically dissociated in
Hanks Balanced Salt Solution containing 0.5 mg/ml Collagenase IV (Sigma), 0.1 mg/ml
Hyaluronidase V (Sigma), 0.6 U/ml Dispase II (Roche) and 0.005 MU/ml DNAse I (Sigma)
at 37°C for 5–30 min. The duration of enzymatic treatment was optimized for greatest yield
of live CD11b+ cells per tumor type. Cell suspensions were filtered through a 70μm cell
strainer. Red blood cells were solubilized with red cell lysis buffer (Pharm Lyse, BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and the resulting suspension was filtered through a cell strainer
to produce a single cell suspension. Cells were washed one time with PBS prior to use in
flow cytometry analysis or magnetic bead purification.
Peritoneal Macrophage Isolation
Thioglycollate elicited peritoneal macrophages were collected 96h after i.p. injection of a
3% thioglycollate solution. Cells were harvested from the peritoneal cavity in 10ml of PBS
and macrophage enrichment was performed by plating cells in RPMI with 10% FBS and 1%

washes, and cells were analyzed via flow cytometry and qPCR analysis.
Flow cytometry staining and analysis

Author Manuscript

Single cell suspensions (10^6 cells in 100 μL total volume) were incubated with Aqua Live
Dead fixable stain (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), FcR-blocking reagent (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and fluorescently labeled antibodies and incubated at 4°C for 1h.
Primary antibodies to cell surface markers directed against F4/80 (BM8), CD45 (30-F11),
CD11b (M1/70), Gr1 (RB6-8C5), CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (53–6.7), CD273
(B7-DC), CD274 (B7-H1) were from eBioscience; Ly6C (AL-21), Ly6G (1A8), CD11c
(HL3), and MHC-II (AF6-120.1) from BD Pharmingen, CCR2 (475301) from R&D
Systems and CD206 (MR5D3) from AbD Serotech. For intracellular staining, cells were
fixed, permeabilized using Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) and then
incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies to FoxP3 (FJK-16s) from eBioscience.
Multicolor FACS Analysis was performed on a BD Canto RUO 11 Color Analyzer. All data
analysis was performed using the flow cytometry analysis program FloJo (Treestar).
Magnetic bead purification of myeloid cells
Single cell preparations from bone marrow or tumors were incubated with FcR-blocking
reagent (BD Biosciences) and then with 20μl magnetic microbeads conjugated to antibodies
against CD11b, Gr1, CD90.2, CD4 and CD8 (Miltenyi Biotech MACS Microbeads)/1xE7
cells for 20 min at 4°C. Cells bound to magnetic beads were then removed from the cell
suspension according to manufacturers instructions.
Flow cytometric sorting of cells from tumors and bone marrow

Author Manuscript

For cell sorting, single cell suspensions were stained with Aqua Live Dead fixable stain
(Life Technologies) to exclude dead cells and anti-CD11b-APC (M1/70, eBioscience) and
anti-Gr1-FITC (RB6-8C5, eBioscience) antibodies. FACS sorting was performed on a FACS
Aria 11 color high speed sorter at the Flow Cytometry Core at the UC San Diego Center for
AIDS Research. Live cells were sorted into the following populations: CD11b+Gr1−,
CD11b+Gr1lo, CD11b+Gr1hi and CD11b−Gr1− cells. CD11b positive cells were defined by
increased staining over the isotype control, and Gr1 levels were defined both by comparison
to the isotype control and relative staining to other populations.
Murine macrophage differentiation and culture

Author Manuscript

Bone marrow derived cells (BMDC) were aseptically harvested from 6–8 week-old female
mice by flushing leg bones of euthanized mice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.5%
BSA, 2mM EDTA, incubating in red cell lysis buffer (155 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM NaHCO3
and 0.1 mM EDTA) and centrifuging over Histopaque 1083 to purify the mononuclear cells.
Approximately 5X107 BMDC were purified by gradient centrifugation from the femurs and
tibias of a single mouse. Purified mononuclear cells were cultured in RPMI + 20% serum
+ 50ng/ml M-CSF (PeproTech).

Human macrophage differentiation and culture

Author Manuscript

Human leukocytes concentrated by from apheresis were obtained from the San Diego Blood
Bank. Cells were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.5% BSA, 2mM EDTA,
incubated in red cell lysis buffer (155 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM NaHCO3 and 0.1 mM EDTA)
and centrifuged over Histopaque 1077 to purify mononuclear cells. Approximately 109
BMDC were purified by gradient centrifugation from one apheresis sample. Purified
mononuclear cells were cultured in RPMI + 20% serum + 50ng/ml Human M-CSF
(PeproTech). Non-adherent cells were removed after 2h by washing, and adherent cells were
cultured for 6 days to differentiate macrophages fully.
Macrophage polarization

Author Manuscript

Bone marrow derived macrophages were polarized with either IFNγ (20 ng/ml, Peprotech)
plus LPS (100 ng/ml, Sigma) or LPS alone for 24h or IL-4 (20 ng/ml, Peprotech) for 24–
48h. For inhibitor studies, PI3Kγ inhibitors (1 μM) (IPI-549, Infinity Pharmaceuticals and
TG100–115, Targegen/Sanofi-Aventis), rapamycin (10 μM) (Selleck), or ML120B (30 μM)
were incubated with macrophages 1h prior to the addition of polarizing stimuli. Total RNA
was harvested from macrophages using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacture’s instructions.
RNA sequencing

Author Manuscript

Freshly isolated mouse bone marrow cells from 9 WT and 9 p110γ−/− mice were pooled
into 3 replicates sets of WT or p110g−/− cells and differentiated into macrophages for six
days in RPMI + 20% FBS+ 1%Pen/Strep+ 50 ng/ml M-CSF. Each replicate set of
macrophages was then treated with mCSF, IL-4 or IFNg/LPS. Macrophages were removed
from dishes, and RNA was harvested using Qiagen Allprep kit. In addition, RNA was
harvested from day 14 (500mm3) LLC tumors or purified CD11b+Gr1-F480+ TAMs from
WT (C57BL/6) and p110γ−/− null mice. RNA was harvested using Qiagen Allprep kit.
RNA libraries prepared from 1 μg RNA per sample were prepared for sequencing using
standard Illumina protocols. RNA sequencing was performed by the University of
California, San Diego Institute for Genomic Medicine. mRNA profiles were generated by
single read deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
Sequence analysis

Author Manuscript

Sequence analysis was performed as previously described.15 Sequence files from Illumina
HiSeq that passed quality filters were aligned to the mouse transcriptome (mm9 genome
build) using the Bowtie2 aligner4. Gene-level count summaries were analyzed for
statistically significant changes using DESeq. Individual p-values were adjusted for multiple
testing by calculating Storey's q-values using fdrtooltrimmer. For each gene, the q-value is
the smallest false discovery rate at which the gene is found significant. We analyzed
biological processes as defined by the Gene Ontology Consortium. Each gene ontology term
defines a set of genes. The entire list of genes, sorted by the q-value in ascending order, is
subjected to a non-parametric variant of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), in
which the parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value is replaced with the exact rank-order pvalue. We perform a Bonferroni adjustment of gene set p-values for the number of gene sets

Individual quantitative RT-PCR

Author Manuscript

cDNA was prepared using 1μg RNA with the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta
Biosciences). Sybr green-based qPCR was performed using human and murine primers to
Arg1, Ifng, Il10, Il12p40, Il1b, Il6, Ccl2, Vegfa, Gapdh, Nos2, Tgfb1, Tnfa and murine H2Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb1, and H60a (Qiagen QuantiTect Primer Assay). mRNA levels were
normalized to Gapdh (dCt = Ct gene of interest – Ct Gapdh) and reported as relative mRNA
expression (ddCt = 2^-(dCt sample – dCt control)) or fold change.
siRNA mediated knockdown and gene transfection
Freshly isolated bone marrow derived CD11b+ myeloid cells or differentiated macrophages
were transfected by electroporation using an AMAXA Mouse Macrophage Nucleofection
Kit with 100nM of siRNA or 2μg p110gCAAX or pcDNA control plasmid. Non-silencing
(Ctrl_AllStars_1), Cebpb (MmCebpb_4 and MmCebpb_6), Mtor (Mm_Frap1_1 and
Mm_Frap1_2) were purchased from Qiagen. After transfection, cells were cultured for 36–
48 h in RPMI containing 10% serum and 10ng/ml M-CSF (PeproTech) or polarized as
described above.
ELISA assays

Author Manuscript

Whole tumors, CD11b+Gr1− cells, CD90.2+ cells, CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells isolated
from LLC tumors were lysed in RIPA buffer and total protein concentration was determined
using a BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Macrophage supernatants (100 μl) or 500 μg of total
protein lysate from tumors were used in ELISAs to detect CCL2, TGFβ, IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6,
IFNγ, IL-10, IL-12 and Granzyme B (Ready Set Go ELISA, eBioscience). Protein
expression was normalized to total volume (supernatants) or mg total protein (tumor
lysates).
Quantitative Colorimetric Arginase Determination

Author Manuscript

The QuantiChrom Arginase Assay Kit (DARG-200, BioAssay Systems) was used to
measure Arginase activity in primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages from
wildtype and p110γ−/− mice according to manufacturer’s instructions. For all conditions,
cells were harvested and lysed in 10 mM Tris (pH7.4) containing 1 μM pepstatin A, 1 μM
leupeptin, and 0.4% (w/v) TritonX-100. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000g at 4°C for 10
min.
Transcription Factor Assays
To measure NFκB and C/EBPβ activation, TransAM NFκB Family and C/EBPa/b
Transcription Factor Assay Kits (43296 and 44196, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) were used

according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, wild type and p110γ−/− bone marrow derived
macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or IL-4 (20 ng/ml) and nuclear extracts
were prepared in lysis buffer AM2. Nuclear extracts were incubated with the immobilized
consensus sequences and RelA, cRel or C/EBPβ were detected using specific primary
antibodies. Quantification was performed via colorimetric readout of absorbance at 450 nm.
Immunoblotting

Author Manuscript

IL-4 and LPS macrophage cultures were solubilized in RIPA buffer containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitors. Thirty μg protein was electrophoresed on Biorad precast gradient
gels and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. Proteins were detected by incubation with
1:1000 dilutions of primary antibodies, washed and incubated with Goat anti-rabbit-HRP
antibodies and detected after incubation with a chemiluminescent substrate. Primary
antibodies directed against Akt (11E7), p-Akt (244F9), IkBa (L35A5), IKKb (D30C6), pIKKa/b (16A6), NFkBp65 (D14E12), pNFkBp65 (93H1), C/EBPb (#3087), p-CEBPb
(#3082), IRAK1 (D51G7), TBK1 (D1B4), and p110γ (#4252) were from Cell Signaling
Technology and pTBK1 (EPR2867(2)) was from Abcam.
In vitro cytotoxicity assay
CD90.2+ tumor derived T cells were purified from LLC tumor-bearing WT and p110γ−/−
or TG100–115 and control treated mice and then co-incubated with LLC tumor cells (target
cells) at 2.5:1, 5:1 and 10:1 ratios of T cells to tumor cells (2×103 LLC tumor cells per well)
for 6 hours. Target cell killing was assayed by collecting the supernatants from each well for
measurement of the lactate dehydrogenase release (Cytotox96 Non Radioactive Cytotoxicity
Assay kit, Promega).

Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Tumor samples were collected and cryopreserved in O.C.T. Sections (5μm) were fixed in
100% cold acetone, blocked with 8% normal goat serum for 2 hours, and incubated antiCD8 (53–6.7, 1:50 BD Biosciences) for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were washed
3 times with PBS and incubated with Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibodies. Slides
were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to identify nuclei.
Immunofluorescence images were collected on a Nikon microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U)
and analyzed using Metamorph image capture and analysis software (Version 6.3r5,
Molecular Devices). The detection of apoptotic cells was performed using a TUNEL-assay
(ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit, Promega) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were washed and mounted in DAKO fluorescent
mounting medium. Immunofluorescence images were collected on a Nikon microscope
(Eclipse TE2000-U) and analyzed with MetaMorph Software (version 6.3r5) or SPOT
software (version 4.6). Pixels/field or cell number/field were quantified in five 100x fields
from 10 biological replicates.
Statistics
Primary tumor samples with mRNA expression data were scored as above or below the
median expression level, and tested for association with patient survival using a logrank test

at 5% significance. For studies evaluating the effect of drugs on tumor size, tumor
dimensions were measured directly before the start of treatment, tumor volumes were
computed and mice were randomly assigned to groups so that the mean volume +/− s.e.m. of
each group was identical. A sample size of 10 mice/group provided 80% power to detect
mean difference of 2.25 standard deviation (SD) between two groups (based on a twosample t-test with 2-sided 5% significance level). Sample sizes of 15 mice/group provided
80% power to detect one SD difference between two groups. Data were normalized to the
standard (control). Significance testing was performed by one-way Anova with Tukey's
posthoc testing for multiple pairwise testing with more than two groups and by parametric or
nonparametric Student’s t test when only two groups were compared. We used a two-sample
t-test (two groups) and ANOVA (multiple groups) when data were normally distributed and
a Wilcoxon rank sum test (two groups) when data were not normally distributed. All mouse
studies were randomized and blinded; assignment of mice to treatment groups, tumor
measurement and tumor analysis was performed by coding mice with randomly assigned
mouse number, with the key unknown to operators until experiments were completed. In
tumor studies for which tumor size was the outcome, animals removed from the study due to
health concerns were not included in endpoint analyses. All experiments were performed at
least twice; n refers to biological replicates.

Extended Data Figure 10. PI3Kγ promotes immune suppression

Author Manuscript

(a) Comparison of gene expression between HPV+ and HPV− cohorts indicating HPV−
samples had significantly (p<0.05) lower expression of adaptive immune genes and higher
expression of immune suppressive/pro-metastasis genes (Blue: HPV− samples, Red: HPV+
samples.) (b) Model depicting the effect of PI3Kγ inhibition on tumor immune suppression.
PI3Kγ inhibition converts tumor-associated macrophages into pro-inflammatory
macrophages that promote a CD8+ T cell response that suppresses tumor growth. (c) Model
depicting the PI3Kγ signaling pathway in macrophages. PI3Kγ activation restrains NFκB
activation and promotes mTOR-dependent C/EBPβ activation, leading to expression of
immune suppressive factors and tumor growth. In contrast, PI3Kγ inhibition inhibits C/
