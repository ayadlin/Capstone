Abstract
Combination therapy has proven successful in treating a wide
variety of aggressive human cancers. Historically, combination
treatments have been discovered through serendipity or
lengthy trials using known anticancer agents with similar
indications. We have used combination high-throughput
screening to discover the unexpected synergistic combination
of an antiparasitic agent, pentamidine, and a phenothiazine
antipsychotic, chlorpromazine. This combination, CRx-026,
inhibits the growth of tumor cell lines in vivo more effectively
than either pentamidine or chlorpromazine alone. Here, we
report that CRx-026 exerts its antiproliferative effect through
synergistic dual mitotic action. Chlorpromazine is a potent
and specific inhibitor of the mitotic kinesin KSP/Eg5 and
inhibits tumor cell proliferation through mitotic arrest and
accumulation of monopolar spindles. Pentamidine treatment
results in chromosomal segregation defects and delayed
progression through mitosis, consistent with inhibition of
the phosphatase of regenerating liver family of phosphatases.
We also show that CRx-026 synergizes in vitro and in vivo with
the microtubule-binding agents paclitaxel and vinorelbine.
These data support a model where dual action of pentamidine
and chlorpromazine in mitosis results in synergistic antitumor effects and show the importance of systematic
screening for combinations of targeted agents. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Given the biological complexity of disease and the redundancy
of biological systems, combination therapies have become a
general approach in the treatment of disease. Indeed, combination therapy has proven to be successful in treating a wide variety
of aggressive human cancers, including colon, lung, and breast
(1–3). The vast array of gene mutations in human cancers and the
prevalence of multiple mutations per tumor explain the
effectiveness of combination approaches in cancer (4–6). Many
current cancer treatment guidelines rely heavily on combinations
of cytotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, platinum drugs, and
taxanes (7–9), and although new, highly selective targeted agents
have recently shown promise, it seems that many will only be
effective when used in combination (4, 10, 11). Researchers and
clinicians thus face the challenge of identifying the best
combinations of drugs and refining their dose and schedule for

optimum effectiveness. A systematic approach to searching all
possible combinations of drugs can significantly advance this
process by revealing both synergies and antagonisms that may be
overlooked by the current standard practice of intuition-based
combination experiments (12, 13).
Mitosis has long been known as a crucial target for therapeutic
intervention in cancer. Classic mitotic spindle poisons, such as
Vinca alkaloids and taxanes, have been in clinical practice for
decades and continue to be important components of chemotherapy regimens (14). Multiple mechanisms working in concert are
required to ensure proper mitotic spindle assembly, dynamics, and
regulation throughout mitosis (15). Furthermore, numerous
network connections between mitosis and other pathways
important for cancer growth and survival, such as DNA damage,
checkpoint controls, and cell death, suggest that antimitotic
combination therapy holds great promise (16). The next generation
of antimitotic drugs targeting nonstructural components of
mitosis, such as mitotic kinesins, aurora kinases, and polo-like
kinases, is now emerging in several drug development pipelines
(16, 17). Mitotic kinesins comprise a family of 11 kinesin proteins
responsible for spindle and chromosome movement in mitosis (18).
Due to their specific role in dividing cells, mitotic kinesins have
emerged as compelling drug targets for therapeutic intervention in
cancer (14, 16). One member of this class is the kinesin spindle
protein KSP/Eg5, a molecular motor required to establish bipolar
spindles in mitosis (19, 20). Several potent and selective inhibitors
of KSP/Eg5 are currently under development (16).
Mitotic kinases and phosphatases have also recently enjoyed
attention as novel targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer
(16, 21). Aurora kinases have multiple roles in mitosis, including
centrosome function, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis
(22, 23). Recent advances in understanding the roles of mitotic
phosphatases such as CDC25 and the phosphatase of regenerating
liver (PRL) family of phosphatases have generated interest in these
protein families as targets for small-molecule drug development
(21, 24). Significantly, these emerging kinase and phosphatase
targets play roles at multiple points throughout the process
of mitosis, and although inhibition of some causes mitotic arrest,
inhibition of others seems to cause loss of checkpoint control
resulting in catastrophic cell death (16, 22). Striking the right
balance between efficacy and therapeutic window is a key challenge
in the development of new antimitotic agents, and importantly,
most drugs of this class have shown mechanism-based side effects,
such as neutropenia (16). The goal of broadening the therapeutic
window for these agents may optimally occur through combining
mechanisms for maximum specificity and efficacy.
We have previously reported the use of combination highthroughput screening for the systematic identification of synergistic antiproliferative drug combinations (25). This screening effort
resulted in the identification of the unexpected synergistic

combination of an agent previously understood as an antiparasitic
agent, pentamidine, and a phenothiazine previously understood
as an antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, hereto referred to as the
synergistic combination CRx-026. The components of CRx-026 have
been coadministered in human phase I trials in patients with solid
tumors who have failed prior chemotherapy and are being
coformulated into a novel pharmaceutical preparation for continuous infusion.
Here, we characterize the molecular mechanism of CRx-026
antiproliferative activity. We have determined that chlorpromazine
is a potent and specific inhibitor of the mitotic kinesin KSP/Eg5. As
predicted for an inhibitor of mitotic kinesins, chlorpromazine
treatment results in mitotic arrest and accumulation of cells
displaying a monopolar spindle with incompletely separated
centrosomes. Studies correlating inhibition of proliferation, the
appearance of monopolar spindles, mitotic arrest, and inhibition of
kinesin motor activity suggest that the effect of chlorpromazine
results from its inhibition of KSP/Eg5 motor activity. We further
report that pentamidine, the other component of CRx-026, also plays
a role in mitosis. Treatment with pentamidine results in defects in
chromosome segregation as evidenced by the appearance of a 5-fold
increase in postmitotic DNA bridges. Furthermore, treatment of cells
with pentamidine results in a delay in progression through mitosis.
Both mitotic phenotypes are consistent with the disruption of the
function of PRL phosphatases. Finally, we report that CRx-026
synergizes with microtubule-binding agents in vitro and in vivo to
inhibit tumor cell proliferation.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and supplies. HCT116 and A549 were from the American
Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37jC. Pentamidine,
chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, promethazine, and paclitaxel
were obtained from Sigma; vinorelbine was obtained from Sequoia Research
Products. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO as high concentration
stocks before dilution into medium.
Inhibition of proliferation assays. Cells were seeded at 1,500 per well
and cultured for 16 to 24 h before addition of compound. After compound
addition, inhibition of proliferation was determined using CellTiter-Blue
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Inhibition of
proliferation was determined by the following formula: %I = [(median
untreated  treated well) / median untreated] * 100.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. After compound treatment, cells
were washed with PBS and fixed in ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde for
10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were
blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 4% normal goat serum in
PBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies in
1% BSA/PBS overnight at 4jC. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated
with conjugated secondary antibodies in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room
temperature. Cells were washed thrice with PBS for 5 min each. During the
second wash, either 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) or SYTOX
Green (Molecular Probes) was added for visualization of DNA. Fluorescent
microscope images were obtained using a Nikon TS100 inverted microscope
and 40X Plan Fluor or 60X Plan Apo objectives. Images were photographed
using Spot advanced software. Some images of monopolar spindles were
taken using a two-photon scanning confocal microscope and images were
processed using NIH ImageJ ( freeware developed by Wayne Rasband,
National Institute of Mental Health, Rockville, MD). Monoclonal mouse
anti-a-tubulin antibody and rabbit anti-g-tubulin antibody (both from
Sigma) were used at 1:1,000 dilution and rabbit anti-a-tubulin antiserum
(Sigma) was used at 1:200 dilution. Secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488
donkey anti-mouse IgG (green) and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG
(red), both from Molecular Probes, were used at 1:1,000 dilution.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

For quantitation of monopolar spindles, HCT116 cells were seeded on
chamber slides and allowed to recover overnight and then treated with
either chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, promethazine, or vehicle control for
48 h. Cells were fixed and stained as described above using DAPI to visualize
DNA and monoclonal mouse anti-a-tubulin antibody with Alexa Fluor 488
donkey anti-mouse IgG (green) secondary antibody to visualize microtubules. The percentage of the mitotic population with monopolar versus
bipolar spindle morphologies was determined.
For quantitation of DNA bridges, A549 cells were seeded on chamber
slides, allowed to recover overnight, and then serum starved for 72 h (to
enrich in cells in G1) before the addition of fresh serum containing medium
with 8 Amol/L pentamidine or DMSO for an additional 24 to 48 h. DNA was
visualized with SYTOX Green and microtubules were visualized with rabbit
anti-g-tubulin antibody and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (red).
Cells in anaphase through mitotic exit were counted.
Cell-free KSP assay. Kinesin activity was assayed using the Kinesin
ATPase End Point Biochem kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The following purified motor proteins were
used (all from Cytoskeleton): human Eg5 kinesin motor domain protein,
human chromokinesin kinesin motor domain protein, and human kinesin
heavy chain motor domain protein. Kinesin activity was determined by Pi
based on the standard curve. Inhibition of kinesin activity was calculated by
the following formula: average %I = [(average untreated  average treated) /
average untreated] * 100. Data represent four replicates from two separate
experiments. A standard curve was performed with all recombinant
kinesins to obtain the same specific activity.
Cell cycle analysis and synchronization. A549 cells were plated and
serum starved for 72 h to arrest cells in G1. Then, complete medium
containing compound was added and cells were incubated for an additional
72 h. HCT116 cells were plated and immediately treated with compound for
72 h. Following compound treatment, cells were stained with propidium
iodide using standard methods. Cells were analyzed for DNA by flow
cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur and ModFit LT software.
In some experiments, A549 cells were synchronized by the addition of
nocodazole (0.2 Ag/mL) for 18 h to block cells in prometaphase. Fifteen
hours before release, cells were treated with 4 Amol/L pentamidine or
DMSO vehicle control. Cells were released from the block in the presence of
pentamidine or DMSO, harvested at the indicated time points, and analyzed
for cell cycle profile.
Xenograft animal studies. Chlorpromazine and pentamidine were
prepared in PBS with 10% ethanol. Paclitaxel was prepared using an emulsion
of Cremophor EL/ethanol (50:50) and diluted 1:6 in 0.9 mol/L NaCl
immediately before injection. Chlorpromazine and pentamidine were given
as two separate injections. A549 cells were grown in DMEM and HCT116
cells in McCoy’s 5A medium, each supplemented with 10% FBS, at 37jC.
All experiments were carried out using 6- to 8-week-old male or female severe
combined immunodeficient Hsd:ICR(CD-1) mice (Harlan). A549 cells were
harvested, suspended in DMEM minus serum, and injected s.c. into the
right flanks (4  106/flank in a 300–500 AL volume). HCT116 cells were
harvested, suspended in McCoy’s 5A minus serum, and injected s.c. into the
right and left flanks (5  106/flank in a 300 AL volume). Tumor volumes
were determined by measuring the length (l) and the width (w) and
calculating the volume (V = lw 2 / 2). Depending on the study, the tumors were
between f400 and 800 mm3 at the time of randomization into treatment
groups (n = 8–10 mice per group). Unless otherwise stated, drugs were
given daily (Monday to Friday). Paclitaxel was given 3 days per week
(Monday, Wednesday, and Friday only). All drugs were given by i.p. injection in
a volume of 100 AL/25 g. Animals undergoing combination therapy
received two individual injections for a total of 200 AL per mouse. Control
animals received 200 AL injections of vehicle only. Reduction in tumor
volume relative to control on the last day of treatment was calculated using
the following formula: %reduction = (control tumor volume  treated tumor
volume) / control tumor volume. Change in body weight on the last day of
treatment was calculated using the following formula: %change = (weight
at end of treatment  weight at start of treatment) / weight at start of
treatment. Percent of surviving animals was calculated at the end of the study.
Evaluation of the results included statistical analysis of differences in tumor

size and body weight between test and control groups at the end of each
treatment period. Group means were compared using a one-way ANOVA. If
the ANOVA was significant, P V 0.05, multiple comparison tests (Dunnett’s)
were used to determine which groups were different. Only animals surviving
to the completion of the treatment period were included in the analysis.

Results
Pentamidine and chlorpromazine combine to produce
synergistic inhibition of tumor growth. The novel and
unexpected combination of pentamidine and chlorpromazine
was originally identified in a screen of f100,000 pairwise
combinations of approved drugs for combinations that inhibit
the proliferation of the non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
cell line A549 (25). An isobologram showing the synergistic effect
of CRx-026 is shown in Fig. 1A. The synergistic antitumor effect
of CRx-026 was further examined in human tumor xenograft
models using A549 NSCLC and HCT116 colorectal carcinoma
cells (Fig. 1B; Table 1; ref. 25). HCT116 tumors treated with CRx026 were consistently smaller than vehicle, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
and the individual components throughout the course of the
study (Fig. 1B). On the final day of treatment, tumors treated
with CRx-026 were reduced by 59% compared with the vehicle
control. Tumors treated with 5-FU (25 mg/kg) were 47% smaller
than vehicle controls. Mice receiving chlorpromazine or pentamidine alone exhibited nonsignificant decreases in tumor
volume. The effect of CRx-026 in reducing tumor volumes was
consistent across multiple studies with A549 and HCT116 cells
using varied doses and schedules and was generally well
tolerated (Table 1).
Chlorpromazine is an inhibitor of the mitotic kinesin KSP/
Eg5. During the characterization of CRx-026, we examined mitotic
phenotypes associated with chlorpromazine treatment. A549
NSCLC cells were treated with chlorpromazine or vehicle for
48 h followed by staining with an anti-a-tubulin antibody and the
DNA-binding dye DAPI (Fig. 2A). Normal, bipolar mitotic spindle
morphology was observed in the vehicle-treated samples. Conversely, in the chlorpromazine-treated samples, a striking and aberrant

monopolar spindle morphology was observed. The monopolar
spindle phenotype was the predominant mitotic morphology
observed in chlorpromazine-treated cells (Fig. 2B), with >90% of
the chlorpromazine-treated mitotic cells displaying this phenotype.
To determine whether the formation of the monopolar spindle in
chlorpromazine-treated cells was a result of failure of centrosome
duplication or failure of centrosome separation, we examined the
centrosomes by staining with an anti-g-tubulin antibody (Fig. 2A,
h). We consistently observed two distinct foci of g-tubulin staining
that is typical of duplicated centrosomes, indicating that the
observed monopolar spindle morphology is not the result of a
block in centrosome duplication but instead results from a defect
in centrosome separation. Treatment with the small-molecule
kinesin inhibitor monastrol is also known to prevent the separation
of centrosomes in mitosis and result in the monopolar spindle
morphology (26). Monastrol treatment of A549 cells resulted in the
accumulation of cells with monopolar spindles morphologically
indistinguishable from those observed with chlorpromazine
treatment (Fig. 2B).
To explore the possibility that chlorpromazine inhibits the activity
of one or more mitotic kinesins, we examined the effect of
chlorpromazine on the microtubule-dependent hydrolysis of ATP
by the mitotic kinesin KSP/Eg5 (Fig. 2C). In this assay, which
measures inorganic phosphate generated from the hydrolysis of ATP
by kinesin motor proteins (27), chlorpromazine caused a dosedependent decrease in the ability of KSP/Eg5 to hydrolyze ATP with
an IC50 of approximately 5 to 10 Amol/L. Interestingly, this inhibitory
effect of chlorpromazine seems to be specific to the kinesin KSP/Eg5
(Fig. 2D). Chlorpromazine did not appreciably inhibit the motor
activity of another mitotic kinesin, chromokinesin (28), or a
nonmitotic kinesin, the kinesin heavy chain, even at concentrations
10-fold higher than the IC50 for inhibition of KSP/Eg5 activity.
Chlorpromazine inhibits proliferation through inhibition
of KSP/Eg5. To explore the possibility that inhibition of the
mitotic kinesin KSP/Eg5 is the primary mechanism by which
chlorpromazine inhibits tumor cell proliferation in vitro, we
sought to correlate the potency of chlorpromazine as an

inhibitor of KSP/Eg5 motor activity with its potency in assays for
proliferation and mitotic arrest (Fig. 3A). The dose-response
relationship between chlorpromazine inhibition of proliferation
of HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells and inhibition of KSP/
Eg5 motor activity closely overlaps. Treatment of HCT116 cells
also results in a dose-dependent increase in the population of
mitotic cells displaying the monopolar spindle phenotype, with
an IC50 of 5 to 7 Amol/L, similar to that of the inhibition of
KSP/Eg5 motor activity. Interestingly, chlorpromazine treatment
also results in a dose-dependent increase in the population of
HCT116 cells present in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, with
an IC50 of f10 Amol/L, as would be expected of cells displaying
the monopolar spindle phenotype (29). The dose-response
relationship of accumulation of cells in G2-M in response to
chlorpromazine treatment correlates well with that of chlorpromazine inhibition of KSP/Eg5 motor activity. Thus, chlorpromazine shows a similar potency in four independent assays,
indicating that, in our tumor cell proliferation system, the levels
of chlorpromazine required for inhibition of the KSP/Eg5 motor
activity in a cell-free assay are similar to those required for
activity in cell-based assays.
To show that inhibition of KSP/Eg5 motor activity is the primary
mechanism by which chlorpromazine exerts its antitumor effects,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

we compared chlorpromazine and the additional phenothiazine
compounds, fluphenazine and promethazine, for their efficacy and
potency in inhibition of proliferation, monopolar spindle formation, and inhibition of KSP/Eg5 motor activity (Fig. 3B and C).
Chlorpromazine is the most potent inhibitor of KSP/Eg5 motor
activity followed closely by fluphenazine. Promethazine is significantly less potent in this assay than either chlorpromazine or
fluphenazine (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the three phenothiazines
display the same relative potency in inhibition of proliferation and
in causing the monopolar spindle phenotype as they do in the
inhibition of KSP/Eg5 motor activity (Fig. 3C). Thus, structural
changes that diminish the potency of chlorpromazine toward KSP/
Eg5 also diminish its potency toward the other end points
examined. This correlation of potencies in three different assays
suggests that action at KSP/Eg5 is responsible for the observed
antiproliferative effect of chlorpromazine.
Pentamidine inhibits mitotic progression. A search of the
literature revealed that pentamidine is reported to inhibit the
activity of PRL phosphatases (30) and that these phosphatases are
reported to play a role in the progression of mitosis and
segregation of chromosomes (31). Given our understanding of
the effect of chlorpromazine on the mechanics of spindle
formation, we hypothesized that the synergistic inhibition of

proliferation observed with the combination of pentamidine and
chlorpromazine could result from the dual action of these
compounds on two mitotic targets, KSP/Eg5 and PRL-1. We
therefore examined pentamidine-treated cells for mitotic defects
similar to those observed in the presence of mutations in PRL-1
(i.e., postmitotic DNA bridges, defects in chromosome segregation,
and delayed progression through mitosis; ref. 31). To examine
mitotic defects in chromosome segregation, pentamidine-treated
cells were fixed and stained with the DNA dye SYTOX Green and
for microtubules with anti-a-tubulin (Fig. 4A). In pentamidinetreated cells, we observed numerous occasions of chromosome
segregation defects, including lagging chromosomes in anaphase
and postmitotic DNA bridges (Fig. 4A). Postmetaphase mitotic cells
were quantitated for the frequency of occurrences of these mitotic
defects (Fig. 4B). Postmitotic DNA bridges were relatively rare in
vehicle-treated cells and accounted for only 11% of postmetaphase
mitotic cells. Conversely, in pentamidine-treated cells, there was a
f5.6-fold increase in the frequency of postmetaphase mitotic cells
displaying DNA bridges. These results indicate that pentamidine
treatment results in defects in proper chromosome segregation,
ultimately resulting in aberrant or failed mitosis.
To determine the effect of pentamidine on the progression of
mitosis, we arrested A549 cells in prometaphase with nocodazole
followed by treatment with pentamidine and release from

nocodazole block (Fig. 4C). After release from the block, cells
were harvested at 1-h time points and analyzed for percentage of
cells that had reentered G1 by propidium iodide staining and
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cells treated with
pentamidine returned to G1 with slower kinetics than vehicletreated cells. Vehicle-treated cells took on average 125 min for
50% of the population to enter G1. Notably, cells treated with
pentamidine required on average 172 min for 50% of the
population to enter G1, f47 min longer than vehicle-treated
cells. These results are very similar to the f50-min delay in
progression through mitosis reported to be caused by overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PRL-1 (31),
indicating that pentamidine treatment results in a significant
delay in the progression of cells through mitosis and/or
cytokinesis, possibly via inhibition of the mitotic function of the
PRL phosphatase.
CRx-026 synergizes with microtubule-binding agents. An
agent with a multitarget effect in mitosis would be expected to
synergize with other antimitotic agents, such as the microtubulebinding agents paclitaxel and vinorelbine. To examine this
hypothesis, we screened multiple ratios of CRx-026 against a
panel of 48 known antineoplastic agents in multiple tumor cell
lines. In this screen, we observed the strongest synergies between

paclitaxel, 10 mg/kg; or CRx-026 plus paclitaxel. Percent change in tumor volume compared with vehicle-treated control is presented. *, P < 0.01, significant
difference from vehicle control. B, CRx-026 synergizes with vinorelbine in vitro and in vivo. Left, isobologram (as described in Fig. 1A legend) illustrating the synergistic
interaction at multiple doses and ratios between a fixed ratio of CRx-026 (1:2 chlorpromazine/pentamidine) and vinorelbine at 77% inhibition of proliferation in

plus vinorelbine. Percent change in tumor volume compared with vehicle-treated control is presented. *, P < 0.001, significant difference from vehicle control.

xenograft model using A549 cells, tumors treated with a
combination of CRx-026 and paclitaxel showed significantly lower
tumor volumes than those treated with either paclitaxel or CRx026 alone (Fig. 5A, right). A fixed ratio of 1:2 chlorpromazine/
pentamidine in combination with vinorelbine also showed
significant synergy in HCT116 cells in an in vitro proliferation
assay (Fig. 5B, left). In a murine xenograft model using HCT116
cells, tumors treated with a combination of CRx-026 and
vinorelbine showed significantly reduced tumor volumes compared with tumors treated with either CRx-026 or vinorelbine
alone. Thus, in two independent cellular and in vivo efficacy
models, CRx-026 synergized with microtubule-binding agents
paclitaxel and vinorelbine.

Discussion
CRx-026 was previously identified as the unexpected synergistic
combination of the antiparasitic agent pentamidine and the
phenothiazine antipsychotic chlorpromazine (25). We have now

www.aacrjournals.org

characterized the molecular mechanism of CRx-026 antiproliferative activity showing that it acts through synergistic dual mitotic
action.
Chlorpromazine is an inhibitor of the mitotic kinesin KSP/
Eg5. Several different biological activities have been previously
ascribed to chlorpromazine. As an antipsychotic, chlorpromazine is
generally believed to act through the antagonism of dopamine
receptors. Interestingly, it has been shown that some cancer cell
lines do contain dopamine D2 receptors (32). However, the
mechanism of action of chlorpromazine for preventing the growth
of cancer cell lines in vitro is unlikely to result from D2 antagonism
because additional compounds known to specifically antagonize
dopamine receptors showed no activity in tumor cell line
antiproliferative assays (25). Chlorpromazine has also been
reported to antagonize calmodulin (33), and calmodulin activity
has been reported to be required for the duplication of
centrosomes during S phase (34). It is unlikely that calmodulin
inhibition is invoked at chlorpromazine concentrations where we
see inhibition of proliferation and monopolar spindle formation

because we observe proper centrosome duplication under these
treatment conditions (Fig. 2A).
We have shown here that chlorpromazine is a specific inhibitor of
the mitotic kinesin KSP/Eg5, results that constitute the first
published report that chlorpromazine is an inhibitor of a mitotic
kinesin. This discovery both highlights interesting new hints of
biology invoked by chlorpromazine and also cautions careful
consideration when using small-molecule probes to biological
targets. Several different small-molecule inhibitors of KSP/Eg5 have
been reported. These include monastrol, terpindoles, quinazolones,
and other compounds of note from the patent literature (18).
Monastrol is an allosteric inhibitor of the kinesin that acts by binding
at a site distinct from the ATP-binding site (35). The exact molecular
mechanism by which chlorpromazine inhibits the ATPase activity of
KSP/Eg5 is unknown and is currently under exploration.
Pentamidine has a role in mitotic progression. We report
that pentamidine, the other component of CRx-026, also plays a
role in mitosis. Treatment with pentamidine results in defects in
chromosome segregation as evidenced by the appearance of a
5-fold increase in postmitotic DNA bridges. Furthermore, treatment of cells with pentamidine results in a delay in progression
from mitosis to G1. Previous reports have suggested that
pentamidine may act to inhibit the activity of the PRL phosphatases
(30). Other reports have also indicated that mutations in PRL
phosphatases result in mitotic defects, such as DNA bridges and
delayed progression through mitosis (31). Our data now suggest a
link between the inhibitory effects of pentamidine and the mitotic
defects of PRL phosphatases.
PRL phosphatases are an attractive target for drug discovery
(24). Numerous reports show that this enzyme plays diverse roles in
proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and metastasis. Wang et al. (31)
have reported that overexpression of different mutations in PRL-1
displays differential mitotic phenotypes. Overexpression of a
mutant PRL-1 lacking a residue critical for the farnesylation of
PRL-1 results in the formation of DNA bridges but not a delay in
mitotic transition. Conversely, overexpression of a mutant defective
in catalytic activity results in a mitotic delay but not the formation
of DNA bridges. We observe that pentamidine treatment of cells

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

results in both mitotic bridges and a statistically significant delay in
progression from mitosis to G1. This suggests that pentamidine
inhibition of PRL function is more than simply inhibition of
catalytic activity and may inhibit PRL ability to be farnesylated,
possibly through an allosteric interaction or conformational effect.
The substrate of PRL phosphatases is not known, although
recent reports suggest the possibility that these phosphatases may
prefer hydrophobic substrates. Interestingly, the crystal structure of
the PRL phosphatases indicates that the substrate-binding pocket
for this enzyme is extremely shallow (36). The authors speculate
that part of the substrate-binding pocket may come from an
effector or from the substrate itself. Wang et al. also report that
farnesylation is required for proper localization of PRL-1 to
membranes but not for its localization to the mitotic spindle.
Furthermore, mutation of the site of farnesylation results in mitotic
defects, suggesting a regulatory role for PRL-1 phosphorylation
(31). It is tempting to speculate that pentamidine may interfere
with the interaction of PRL phosphatases with substrates or
cellular effectors, such as lipids or membranes, a function that may
be required for proper segregation of chromatin.
CRx-026 inhibits proliferation through dual mitotic action.
We observe that the combination of pentamidine and chlorpromazine results in synergistic inhibition of tumor cell growth in vitro
and in vivo. This interaction occurs robustly and broadly across
multiple doses and ratios of the two drugs. Taken together with the
molecular mechanism results, these data support a dual mitotic
role for CRx-026 (Fig. 6). According to our model, when cells
treated with CRx-026 transition from prophase to metaphase, the
inhibition of KSP/Eg5 by chlorpromazine prevents centrosome
separation, arresting cells with aberrant monopolar spindle
formation and ultimately resulting in mitotic cell death for some
cells in the population. Cells that are able to overcome this block
and reach anaphase are then further delayed in mitotic progression
by the action of pentamidine at PRL phosphatases resulting in
delayed anaphase transition, defective chromosome segregation,
and postmitotic DNA bridges. Cells that reach this point and exit
mitosis with DNA bridges would arrest in G1 with damaged DNA and
then be subject to the cellular DNA damage response pathways. This

model of dual action in mitosis is consistent with our observations
that CRx-026 and its parts synergize in vitro and in vivo with
microtubule-binding agents and suggests possible strategies for the
clinical deployment of CRx-026. It is interesting to speculate that the
dual action of CRx-026 sensitizes tumor cells that are already
defective in cell cycle regulation to mitotic damage followed by cell
cycle arrest and cell death while sparing normal cells with more
robust cell cycle regulation. Indeed, we have observed that CRx-026
more potently inhibits the proliferation of lung tumor cells than
corresponding normal lung cells (25). In addition, the absence of
toxic side effects normally associated with agents affecting cell cycle
progression supports some form of differential cell cycle sensitivity
of tumor cells to CRx-026 (Table 1; ref. 16).
Importantly, the more general discovery that inhibition of
mitotic kinesins and PRL phosphatases synergizes to inhibit tumor
cell growth may lead to the development of additional multitargeted therapies to treat cancer. Although combining pentamidine and chlorpromazine to access this synergistic effect is a
pragmatic and efficient way to enter proof-of-concept studies for

ultimately the best way to harness this mechanistic synergy may
be the use of other chemistries. Several mitotic kinesin and PRL
phosphatase inhibitors are advancing through preclinical and
clinical pipelines in the drug discovery industry. We predict that
combinations of these drugs would also synergize to create a
potent antitumor effect. The results reported here show the
importance of systematic screening for combinations of targeted
agents that synergize to produce antitumor effects.
