Abstract
Mithramycin (MIT) and tolfenamic acid (TA) inhibit the activity of the transcription factor Sp1. In the
present study, we investigated whether pancreatic cancer treatment with a combination of these compounds
has a synergistic effect on Sp1 activity, tumor growth, and their underlying response mechanisms. Treatment
of pancreatic tumor xenografts with MIT and TA produced dose-dependent antitumor activity, and significant
antitumor activity of either compound alone was directly associated with systemic side effects. Combination
treatment with nontoxic doses of both compounds produced synergistic antitumor activity, whereas treatment with a nontoxic dose of either compound alone lacked a discernible antitumor effect. Synergistic therapeutic effects correlated directly with synergistic antiproliferation and antiangiogenesis in vitro. Moreover,
combination treatment resulted in Sp1 protein degradation, drastically downregulating expression of Sp1 and
vascular endothelial growth factor. Our findings established that Sp1 is a critical target of TA and MIT in
human pancreatic cancer therapy, rationalizing clinical studies to determine the effect of existing pancreatic
cancer therapy regimens on Sp1 signaling in tumors and normal pancreatic tissue, and the ability of Sp1targeting strategies to modify cancer responses. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1111–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is currently the fourth leading cause of
cancer-related deaths worldwide. The median survival duration from diagnosis to death is ∼6 months, and the overall
5-year survival rate is <5% (1–3). A full understanding of the
cellular and molecular mechanisms of the development and
progression of pancreatic cancer is crucial for identifying
new targets of effective treatment modalities for this deadly
disease. Among the various potential targets are numerous
proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors released by tumor
and host cells (4–6). These factors regulate angiogenesis, which
determines the growth and metastasis of pancreatic tumors
(6–8). Of the numerous angiogenic factors discovered thus
far, studies have identified vascular endothelial growth factor

(VEGF) as a key mediator of tumor angiogenesis (9–11).
Authors have reported elevated expression of VEGF in human
pancreatic tumor specimens (12, 13), that its expression level
correlates with microvessel density (MVD; refs. 4, 6, 14–16),
and that VEGF-targeted therapy significantly inhibits angiogenesis in and growth of pancreatic cancer in animal models
(4, 6, 17).
Previous studies showed that Sp1 overexpression plays an
important role in regulating the expression of VEGF and angiogenesis in pancreatic tumors and is directly correlated
with poor prognoses for human pancreatic cancer (18–20).
In addition, we have shown that neutralization of VEGF by
treatment with bevacizumab (Avastin) leads to feedback activation of Sp1 and subsequent upregulation of expression of
VEGF and other factors, leading to Avastin resistance, whereas blockade of Sp1 expression and function sensitizes tumors
to Avastin and/or reverses Avastin resistance (21). Therefore,
Sp1 seems to be a critical target for antiangiogenic therapy
for pancreatic cancer.
Sp1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that is important to
the transcription of many cellular and viral genes containing
GC boxes in their promoters. Researchers have cloned transcription factors similar to Sp1 in their structural and transcriptional properties (Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4), thus identifying
the Sp1 multigene family (22). Although Sp1 has been perceived to be a basal transcription factor since its discovery,
increasing evidence suggests that it regulates a variety of
biological functions, including cell survival, growth, and differentiation and tumor development and progression (20,
22–25). Consistently, mithramycin A (MIT) and tolfenamic

acid (TA) inhibit Sp1 activity and have antitumor effects in
various tumor models.
The antitumor activity of MIT, an aureolic acid–type polyketide produced by various soil bacteria of the genus Streptomyces, inhibits Sp1 activity (26–30). Its major underlying
mechanism of action includes a reversible interaction with
dsDNA with GC base specificity and selective regulation of
transcription of genes having GC-rich promoter sequences
(31–35). In comparison, TA, a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin
biosynthesis and an inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis, is an effective, well-documented nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
used to treat migraines and was recently shown to facilitate Sp1
protein degradation (36–40). Therefore, the two compounds
have distinct mechanisms of regulating Sp1 activity. In the
present study, we sought to determine whether treatment
with a combination of these two compounds has a synergistic effect on Sp1 activity and tumor growth in an animal
model of pancreatic cancer. We also explored their underlying mechanisms.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents. MIT (1 mg/vial crystal powder;
lot 055K4011) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and
diluted in sterile water. TA (powder; lot 110H0469) also was

purchased from Sigma Chemical and mixed with corn oil. In
our animal experiments, MIT (0.05–1.50 mg/kg body weight)
was administered via i.p. injection twice a week or as indicated, and TA (10–80 μg/kg) was administered via oral gavage twice a week.
Cell lines and culture conditions. The human pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell lines BxPC3 and PANC-1 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. FG human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were also used as
reported previously (18). The cell lines were maintained
in plastic flasks as adherent monolayers in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and a vitamin solution (Flow
Laboratories).
Animals. Female athymic BALB/c nude mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. The mice were housed
in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions and used when they were 8 wk old. The animals were
maintained in facilities approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International in accordance with the current regulations and
standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and NIH.
Matrigel plug assay. A Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay
was performed essentially as described previously (41, 42).

Matrigel (200 μL) containing 2 × 106 cells was injected s.c.
into nude mice (two injection sites per mouse). The Matrigel
plugs were recovered from the mice 8 d after injection and
carefully stripped of host tissues. After photography, the
Matrigel plugs were weighed and homogenized in 1 mL of
distilled water and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min.
The supernatants were collected for hemoglobin concentration measurement using Drabkin solution (Sigma Chemical)
and a Microplate Manager ELISA reader at 540 nm according
to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative hemoglobin
concentrations were calculated and further normalized according to the weights of the plugs.
Western blot analysis. Whole-cell lysates were prepared
from human pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor tissue
specimens (18). Standard Western blotting was performed
using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against human and
murine Sp1 and VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an
anti-rabbit IgG antibody, which was a horseradish peroxidase–linked F(ab′)2 fragment obtained from a donkey (Amersham). Equal protein specimen loading was monitored by
probing the same membrane filter with antibodies against
β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; ref. 18). The probe proteins were detected using
the Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Immunohistochemical analysis and quantification of
tumor MVD. Tissue sections were prepared and processed
for immunostaining using specific antibodies against CD31
Sp1, VEGF, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
and appropriate secondary antibodies. The levels of gene expression and quantification of tumor MVD were evaluated as
described previously (21).
Sp1 and VEGF promoter constructs and analysis of Sp1
and VEGF promoter activity. The minimal Sp1 and VEGF
promoter reporters in pGL3 luciferase constructs were generated and used as described previously (18, 21). To examine
transcriptional regulation of the Sp1 and VEGF promoters by
TA and MIT, PANC-1 cells were seeded to ∼80% confluence
in six-well plates (in triplicate) and transiently transfected
with 0.6 μg of minimal Sp1 or VEGF reporter plasmids and
0.3 μg of effector expression plasmids as indicated in each
experiment using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The reporter luciferase activity was measured 48 h later using a luciferase assay kit
(Promega). Promoter activity was normalized according to
the protein concentration as described previously (18, 21).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin was prepared from pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic tumors
as described previously (21). A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using a Chromatin

Immunoprecipitation Assay kit (Upstate) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, DNA cross-binding proteins were cross-linked with DNA and lysed in SDS lysis buffer. The lysate was sonicated to shear DNA to 200 to 500 bp.
After preclearing with a salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose 50% slurry for 30 min at 4°C, chromatin specimens were
immunoprecipitated overnight with no antibody or an antiSp1 antibody (PEP2). The region from −224 to −53 bp of the
Sp1 promoter was amplified using the following primers:
sense, 5′-caggcacgcaacttagtc-3′; antisense, 5′-gtaaggaggagggagcag-3′. The region from −272 to +18 bp of the VEGF promoter was amplified using the following primers: sense,
5′-ccgcgggcgcgtgtctctgg-3′; antisense, 5′-tgccccaagcctccgcgatcctc-3′. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose
gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under
UV light.
Statistical analysis. All in vivo experiments used five mice
per group and were repeated at least once with similar results; one representative experiment is presented. The in vitro
cytotoxicity experiments have been performed in triplicate
for each and every time points and concentrations. The significance of the in vitro data was determined using the Student's t test (two-tailed), whereas the significance of the
in vivo data was determined using the two-tailed MannWhitney U test. P levels of ≤0.05 were deemed statistically
significant.

Results
Antitumor effects of MIT and TA in xenograft mouse
models of human pancreatic cancer. Previous studies

showed that Sp1 activity is essential for VEGF expression
and that VEGF plays a major role in pancreatic tumor angiogenesis (18, 43, 44). Treatment with both MIT and TA can
downregulate Sp1, VEGF, and VEGF receptor expression
(39, 40). However, whether these two drugs interact synergistically in regulating Sp1 activity and pancreatic tumor
growth is unknown. We treated PANC-1 xenograft tumors
in nude mice with different doses of MIT (0, 0.05, 0.40, and
1.50 mg/kg) or TA (0, 10, 40, and 80 mg/kg) twice a week
(Fig. 1A). Both MIT and TA had dose-dependent antitumor
activity. However, the body weights of the mice decreased
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), which indicated
systemic cytotoxicity.
Next, we treated PANC-1 xenograft tumors in nude mice
with nontoxic doses of MIT (0.05 mg/kg), TA (10 mg/kg),
or both. We found that TA and MIT alone had marginal antitumor activity. In contrast, the combination of MIT and TA
had significant antitumor activity (Fig. 2A). Furthermore,
treatment with low doses of TA and MIT produced synergistic antitumor activity without any significant systemic side
effects as indicated by a lack of significant weight loss
(Fig. 2B). Therefore, combination administration of low doses
of MIT and TA has a significant therapeutic benefit for
pancreatic cancer.
Effects of treatment with MIT and TA on Sp1 and VEGF
expression and recruitment of Sp1 into their promoters
in vivo. To determine the molecular basis for the synergistic
effect of treatment of pancreatic cancer with MIT and TA,
we performed Western blot analysis using total protein lysates extracted from the PANC-1 tumor specimens collected
from mice that received treatment with PBS, TA, MIT, or
both TA and MIT as shown in Fig. 2. We also analyzed BxPC3

Figure 4. Treatment with TA and MIT
downregulates Sp1 expression in vitro.
PANC-1 cells were incubated in a medium
alone or a medium containing MIT and/or
TA. Total protein lysates were harvested
from the cell cultures, and the level of
Sp1 and VEGF protein expression was
determined using Western blot analysis.
Equal protein specimen loading was
monitored by probing the same membrane
filter with an anti-GAPDH antibody.
A, PANC-1 cells were treated with MIT
(0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 μmol/L) and protein
specimens were harvested after 24 h of
treatment. B, PANC-1 cells were treated
with TA (5, 10, and 20 μmol/L) and protein
specimens were harvested after 24 h of
treatment. C, PANC-1 cells were treated
with MIT (0.05 μmol/L) and TA (5 μmol/L)
and protein specimens were harvested after
12 h of treatment. Note that the control
groups (without MIT and/or TA treatment)
were set to be 100%.

tumor specimens collected from mice that received the same
treatment. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, expression of both Sp1
and VEGF protein was downregulated by treatment with the
combination of TA and MIT. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining showed that treatment with TA or MIT
alone decreased expression of Sp1 and its downstream molecule VEGF in PANC-1 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, as indicated by CD31 staining, tumor MVDs were
lower than those in the control group. However, treatment
with MIT and TA dramatically reduced Sp1 and VEGF expression in the pancreatic tumors, which was consistent with the
reduced MVDs. Furthermore, treatment with MIT and/or TA,
especially the combination treatment, decreased PCNA protein expression in the tumors. These results suggested that
the synergistic antitumor activity of the combination of
MIT and TA may occur through not only an antiangiogenic
effect but also direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.
Effects of treatment with MIT and/or TA on Sp1 and
VEGF protein levels in human pancreatic cancer cells.
To further confirm the effect of treatment with MIT and
TA on gene expression in pancreatic cancer cells, we incubated PANC-1 and BxPC3 cells in a medium alone or a medium
containing MIT (0.01, 0.05, or 0.10 μmol/L) and/or TA (5, 10,

or 20 μmol/L). Western blot analysis showed that Sp1 protein
expression in the cells was downregulated in a dosedependent manner after 24 hours of treatment with MIT
and TA as single agents in vitro (Fig. 4A and B). Interestingly,
combined treatment with low doses of MIT and TA for 12
hours significantly downregulated Sp1 protein expression,
whereas that with MIT and TA alone did not (Fig. 4C). These
findings suggested that, at high doses, treatment with MIT
and TA as single agents significantly decreases Sp1 protein
expression after ∼24 hours and that, at low doses, treatment
with MIT and TA in combination synergistically downregulates Sp1 protein expression within 12 hours.
Synergistic cytotoxicity of MIT and TA in human pancreatic cell lines in vitro. To assess the direct cytotoxicity of
MIT and TA, we treated FG cells with MIT (0.03, 0.050,
0.100, 0.200, or 0.400 μmol/L) and/or TA (2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0,
or 40.0 μmol/L) for 24 to 48 hours. Both drugs exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxicity as determined using a
MTT assay (Fig. 5A). We then optimized the drug concentrations so that neither agent alone had an extensive cytotoxic
effect. Under this condition, the combination of MIT and TA
had substantial cytotoxic effects. To determine the potential
synergistic effect of combination treatment with MIT and

TA, we subjected the MTT cell viability data to further statistical analysis using the Loewe additivity model, which is
among the best general reference models used to evaluate
drug interactions (45). We used the S-PLUS/R software program to evaluate the interaction between MIT and TA in this
model (Supplementary Fig. S2). We used Chou and Talalay's
median-effect equation to perform the calculation (46). Supplementary Fig. S3 shows the estimated interaction indices
from the corresponding fitted dose-effect curve (Fig. 5B).
Synergy between MIT and TA occurs when the interaction
index is <1, whereas antagonism occurs when the interaction
index is >1 (45). As shown in Fig. 5B, four of the five 24-hour
and all five of the 48-hour data points were in the synergistic
area, indicating that the combination of MIT and TA had a
synergistic cytotoxic effect in FG cells. We also confirmed
this synergy in BxPC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Antiangiogenic effects of MIT and TA in vitro. We treated PANC-1 cells with 50 μmol/L TA and/or 0.1 μmol/L MIT.
Western blot analysis confirmed that Sp1 expression was
downregulated in these cells. We then used an endothelial
cell tube formation assay to determine the angiogenic potential of the supernatants of the PANC-1 cells. We assessed the
degree of tube formation as the percentage of cell surface ar-

ea versus the total surface area (Fig. 6A). We obtained representative photomicrographs of tube formation by human
umbilical vein endothelial cells in the supernatants in situ
(Fig. 6A). Treatment with MIT and/or TA reduced the capacity of supernatants of the PANC-1 cells to stimulate tube formation by endothelial cells compared with that of
supernatants of control PANC-1 cells. We confirmed this impaired angiogenic potential using an in vivo Matrigel plug assay (Fig. 6B). Our data suggested that treatment with MIT
and/or TA impaired the angiogenic potential of PANC-1 cells.
Effects of treatment with MIT and TA on recruitment of
Sp1 into the Sp1 and VEGF promoters in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. In this set of experiments, we sought
to determine whether treatment with TA and/or MIT regulated Sp1 and VEGF expression at the transcriptional level.
We transfected Sp1 and VEGF promoter reporter constructs
into PANC-1 cells and then incubated them in a medium
alone or a medium containing 5 μmol/L TA or 0.01 μmol/L
MIT. In vitro, treatment with TA or MIT at the given dose
resulted in low levels of suppression of Sp1 and VEGF promoter activity, whereas treatment with the combination of
TA and MIT significantly suppressed this activity. However,
further deletion of Sp1-binding sites eliminated the ability of

MIT to suppress Sp1 and VEGF promoter activity (Supplementary Fig. S5). Finally, we performed a ChIP assay using
pancreatic tumors formed by PANC-1 cells in nude mice that
received treatment as described in Fig. 2. Treatment with TA
or MIT at the given dose had a minor effect on inhibition of
Sp1 recruitment to its own reporter and the VEGF promoter,
whereas treatment with TA combined with MIT at the same
dose significantly decreased Sp1 recruitment to these two
promoters (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results suggested
that treatment with TA and MIT at low doses results in insignificant transcriptional suppression of Sp1 and VEGF
mRNA transcription activated by Sp1, whereas treatment
with TA combined with MIT at the same doses produces
synergistic transcriptional suppression of Sp1 and VEGF
transcription.

Discussion
In this study, we found that treatment with the combination of MIT and TA at low doses synergistically downregulated the expression of Sp1 and VEGF and produced
synergistic antitumor effects in xenograft mouse models of
human pancreatic cancer. This therapeutic effect was consistent with suppression of the activity of Sp1 and downregulation of the expression of its downstream proangiogenic
molecule, VEGF. Our experimental results indicated that
MIT targets Sp1 at the transcriptional level by inhibiting
Sp1 recruitment into the Sp1 sites of its own promoter,
whereas TA facilitates Sp1 protein degradation (Supplemen-

tary Fig. S7). This study is the first to show synergistic downregulation of expression of the transcription factor Sp1 and
an enhanced therapeutic index resulting from the combined
administration of two drugs having distinct mechanisms of
action in pancreatic cancer.
Angiogenesis plays an important role in the growth and
metastasis of pancreatic tumors. We have shown that both
Sp1 and VEGF are important to pancreatic tumor angiogenesis (18, 21). Other studies have shown that VEGF-targeting
antiangiogenic therapies inhibit pancreatic tumor growth in
mouse models. Researchers have developed strategies targeting VEGF receptors, including the use of anti-VEGF antibodies, to directly interfere with its signal effect (47, 48).
However, resistance to anti-VEGF antibodies occurs in both
animal models and humans. Although the mechanisms of
this resistance are not entirely clear at present, a previous
study by our group suggested that upregulation of Sp1 expression may play a critical role (21). Specifically, treatment
with Avastin increased Sp1 protein expression and activity in
pancreatic tumors and significantly upregulated expression
of VEGF. In contrast, treatment with MIT, which inhibits
Sp1 expression, inhibited VEGF expression in the tumors
and sensitized them to the antitumor activity of Avastin (21).
However, downregulation of Sp1 protein expression in
pancreatic tumors requires prolonged treatment with MIT,
increasing the occurrence of systemic side effects (21). Studies have suggested that MIT inhibits Sp1 expression via direct
competition for Sp1 recruitment into Sp1 sites of the Sp1
promoter (21, 32). Although MIT can effectively block Sp1

mRNA synthesis, the abundance and strong stability of the
Sp1 protein in pancreatic tumor cells prevent MIT from rapidly downregulating Sp1 protein expression. In the present
study, we showed that TA can promote Sp1 protein downregulation, which is consistent with a previous finding of TAfacilitated Sp1 degradation (38). More importantly, combined
treatment with MIT and TA, neither of which has significant
effects on Sp1 protein expression, substantially downregulated Sp1 protein expression, which was consistent with
the synergistic antitumor effect in our mouse model.
Studies have shown that several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have antiangiogenic activity in a wide variety of
xenograft models, including celecoxib (19) and TA (40). Although Sp1 is the primary target of these drugs, they clearly
induce degradation of other members of the Sp1 family, such
as Sp3 and Sp4 (39, 40). Experimental results showed that via
activation of proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp proteins, celecoxib and TA exhibited growth-inhibitory effects
via an antiangiogenic strategy (19, 39, 40). However, downregulation of Sp1 expression by MIT-based treatment is
primarily involved in transcriptional repression of Sp1 expression (21). Therefore, MIT and TA have distinct mechanisms of action in regulation of Sp1 expression and
activity, which is the molecular basis for their synergistic
antiangiogenic and antitumor activity.
In addition to its reported antiangiogenic function that is
consistent with our finding using cDNA microarray analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S8), downregulation of Sp1 may alter the
expression of genes important to cell survival, a mechanism
that is likely responsible for the antitumor activity of TA and
MIT. For example, TA-based treatment activates Sp protein
degradation, decreases Sp protein binding to the survivin
promoter, and inhibits survivin expression in pancreatic cancer cells and subsequently sensitizes the cells to radiotherapy
(39, 49). Consistently, our results showed that TA inhibits tumor cell growth in vitro and that this effect is synergistic with
that of MIT. Altered survivin expression may be one of the
mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of TA and MIT.
As our experimental results showed, single-agent MIT is
significantly cytotoxic when it has a significant antitumor ef-

fect using mouse body weight change as the measurement of
systemic side effect. When we administered MIT and TA together, Sp1 protein expression was synergistically downregulated through different level and tumor growth was
significantly inhibited. However, we observed no detectable
cytotoxic effects of MIT and TA. Our data suggested that administration of the combination of TA and MIT may achieve
the highest therapeutic index.
Collectively, our results suggest that MIT competes Sp1 recruitment to Sp1 sites in both Sp1 and VEGF promoters. TA
does not have this competing ability, but it downregulates
Sp1 protein expression by directly targeting Sp1 at the protein level (Supplementary Fig. S9). The use of low-dose MIT
in combination with low-dose TA is an important novel
strategy of targeting the angiogenic molecule Sp1 at both
the transcriptional and the protein degradation level. Treatment with the combination of MIT and TA in clinical studies
is a rational step forward in the development of effective
targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer as well as other
cancers.
