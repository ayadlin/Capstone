ABSTRACT
Cancer cells robustly expel lactate produced through enhanced glycolysis via
monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and maintain alkaline intracellular pH. To
develop a novel therapeutic strategy against multiple myeloma (MM), which still
remains incurable, we explored the impact of perturbing a metabolism via inhibiting
MCTs. All MM cells tested constitutively expressed MCT1 and MCT4, and most
expressed MCT2. Lactate export was substantially suppressed to induce death along
with lowering intracellular pH in MM cells by blockade of all three MCT molecules with
α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamate (CHC) or the MCT1 and MCT2 inhibitor AR-C155858 in
combination with MCT4 knockdown, although only partially by knockdown of each
MCT. CHC lowered intracellular pH and severely curtailed lactate secretion even when
combined with metformin, which further lowered intracellular pH and enhanced
cytotoxicity. Interestingly, an ambient acidic pH markedly enhanced CHC-mediated
cytotoxicity, suggesting preferential targeting of MM cells in acidic MM bone lesions.
Furthermore, treatment with CHC suppressed hexokinase II expression and ATP
production to reduce side populations and colony formation. Finally, CHC caused
downregulation of homing receptor CXCR4 and abrogated SDF-1-induced migration.
Targeting tumor metabolism by MCT blockade therefore may become an effective
therapeutic option for drug-resistant MM cells with elevated glycolysis.

INTRODUCTION

for its importance in mediating chemotaxis of malignant
cells to these niches [8-11]. Cancer cells expressing
CXCR4 metastasize to tissues that highly produce SDF-1
including bone marrow [12]; MM cells express CXCR4
and migrate to the bone marrow niche where interaction
with osteoclasts and bone marrow stroma cells enhances
MM cell survival and proliferation [4, 9, 10].
Like other cancers, MM cells tend to develop a

Multiple myeloma (MM) has a unique propensity
to develop and expand almost exclusively in the bone
marrow. The bone marrow microenvironment is skewed by
MM cells, which underlies the unique pathophysiology of
MM and confers aggressiveness and drug resistance [1-7].

drug-resistant side population (SP) as defined by breast
cancer resistance protein (BCRP)-mediated ability to
extrude Hoechst33342 dye [13]. BCRP, an ATP binding
cassette (ABC) transporter, expels chemotherapeutic
drugs, and its expression is associated with poor prognosis
[14]. Thus, the drug-resistant SP persists as an issue to be
addressed in the treatment of MM.
Cancer cells exhibit an altered metabotype of
reduced oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced
glycolysis, even in the presence of adequate oxygen
– a phenomenon known as aerobic glycolysis, or the
Warburg effect [15-17]. This advantageous phenotype is
characterized by upregulation of glycolytic enzymes such
as hexokinase II, and can contribute to the enhanced de
novo synthesis of ATP and anabolic intermediates required
for cell growth, while generating important amounts of
lactate as a byproduct [18]. Monocarboxylate transporters
(MCTs) are passive H+-symporters of lactate [19] whose
over-expression, with MCT1/4 chaperone CD147, is
integral to tumor cells’ hyper-glycolytic phenotype [2023]. Cancer cells are able to maintain alkaline intracellular
pH by expelling lactate, contributing to their robust
proliferation, while the resulting acidic extracellular
microenvironment blunts the anti-tumor effects of local

immune cells and chemotherapeutic agents [24-28]. The
importance of elevated glycolytic metabolism has been
demonstrated in MM cells, highlighting the roles of
hexokinase II [29], PDK1 [30, 31] or CD147 [32].
Here, we investigated the impact of MCT blockade
on MM cell survival and drug resistance. MCT inhibition
decreased lactate export while lowering intracellular
pH in MM cells to trigger their death; it also impaired a
glycolytic phenotype of MM cells while curtailing ATP
production and hexokinase II expression, along with
eradicating drug-resistant SP and clonogenic progenitors.
MCT inhibition also attenuated CXCR4 expression in
MM cells and their chemotaxis towards SDF-1 gradients.
These results underscore the value of MCT inhibition for
targeting glycolytic drug-resistant MM cells and their
progenitors.

glycolytic phenotype to robustly expel lactate [29, 33].
MM cell lines and primary MM cells all constitutively
expressed the lactate transporters MCT1 and MCT4
as well as their chaperone protein, CD147, and most
expressed MCT2 (Figure 1A left). Consistent with our
previous observation that MM cells are susceptible to
inhibition of glycolysis compared to normal cells [29, 33],
MM cells produced much more lactate than peripheral
blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors (Figure 1A
right), supporting MCT molecules as a specific target in
MM cells. Because MCT1 and MCT4 are major lactate
transporters in cancer cells, we next examined the
cytotoxic effects of the MCT1 inhibitor quercetin and
MCT4 inhibitor simvastatin on MM cells to determine the
role of MCT1 and MCT4 in MM cell survival. Treatment
with quercetin or simvastatin alone induced moderate cell
death in MM cells, and combined treatment had a greater
effect than either agent alone (Figure 1B).
Treatment with α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamate
(CHC), a known inhibitor of MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4,
dose-dependently induced cell death in MM cell lines and
primary MM cells (Figure 1C). Thus, monocarboxylate
transportation across membranes appears crucial for MM
cell survival.

MM cells and that combined treatment with metformin
exacerbated intracellular acidification. At concentrations
that were moderately cytotoxic in single treatment, CHC
and metformin induced additive cell death in MM cells
(Figure 2E), correlating with intracellular acidification
responses [34].
Cancer cells produce ATP for their growth
and survival largely through enhanced glycolysis. In
consideration that CHC and metformin block different
outlets of the glycolytic pathway (MCT inhibition and
oxidative phosphorylation inhibition, respectively), their
individual and combined effects on MM cell energetics
were assessed. Single treatment with CHC or metformin
lowered ATP levels in all cell lines within two hours, and
the two cooperatively lowered ATP levels (Figure 2F). The
combinatory treatment was able to perturb metabolisms
in MM cells along with intracellular acidification, which
effectively induced energy crisis in MM cells.

Simultaneous inhibition of MCT1, MCT2, and
MCT4 curtails lactate transport and viability in
MM cells
In order to clarify the role of individual MCT
molecules on lactate export in MM cells, we looked at
the effects of siRNA knockdown of individual MCT
molecules. siRNA was successfully transfected to
knockdown MCT1, MCT2, or MCT4 in MM.1S and U266
cells (Figure 3A). Single knockdown of MCT1, MCT2,
or MCT4 partially decreased lactate export, viable cell
counts and intracellular pH, suggesting that each of these
molecules makes a contribution to MM cell metabolism
and homeostasis (Figure 3B). To further confirm the effects
of simultaneously inhibiting MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4,
we examined using AR-C155858, an MCT1 and MCT2
inhibitor, and siRNA knockdown of MCT4, because CHC
inhibits a mitochondrial pyruvate transporter as well [19].
Treatment with AR-C155858 partially suppressed lactate
export and induced death along with lowing intracellular
pH in MM.1S and U266 cells; knockdown of MCT4 by
siRNA substantially enhanced these effects mediated by
AR-C155858 (Figure 3C). Taken together, these results
demonstrated the importance of inhibiting all three MCT
molecules when targeting MM cells.

CHC and metformin cooperatively decrease
intracellular pH levels and induce cell death in
MM cells
Lactate is an MCT substrate that is pivotal to energy
and biomass metabolism as well as pH homeostasis of
cancer cells. We next explored the effect of CHC treatment
on pH levels in MM cells. CHC dose-dependently reduced
lactate concentrations in medium supernatants of MM
cell cultures, indicating curtailed lactate export (Figure
2A). Metformin, a stimulator of glycolysis and lactate
production, drastically increased extracellular lactate
concentration above control levels, but this was reversed
by combination with CHC (Figure 2B), showing effective
blockage of lactate export even in MM cells with increased
lactate production. To check for intracellular acidification,
spectrophotometer measurements were performed using
the pH indicator dye BCECF-AM, which permeates into
cells where cellular esterases cleave the acetoxymethyl
groups, thereby enabling pH-dependent fluorescence
in the cytoplasm. Consistent with the lactate transport
blockade and concomitant intracellular lactate buildup,
or CHC treatment depressed intracellular pH below
control levels; combination with metformin enhanced this
effect (Figure 2C). These results were further confirmed
by photographing individual cells under a fluorescence
microscope under the same treatment conditions with
BCECF-AM as used in spectrophotometer experiments
(Figure 2D). These data suggested that CHC treatment
depressed intracellular pH by lactate sequestration in

Induction of MM cell death is potentiated in
acidic conditions
Compared to normal tissue, tumors tend to develop
abnormally acidic microenvironments, in the pH 6.5
range, which confer immune evasion capability and
enhanced metastatic aggressiveness [24-28]. The ambient
acidified pH of tumor microenvironments in acidic
osteolytic lesions in MM might present an opportunity
to achieve favorable therapeutic window; therefore,

CHC treatment reduces SP as well as colonyforming populations in MM cells

the cytotoxic effect of MCT blockade on MM cells was
assessed at tumor-like pH vis-à-vis physiological pH.
When MM cells were cultured at pH 6.5, intracellular pH
levels were lowered (Figure 4A), but viability was only
marginally affected in RPMI8226, U266 and KMS11
cells (Figure 4B). However, treatment with CHC further
depressed intracellular pH in MM cells cultured at pH 6.5
to markedly enhance MM cell death compared to culturing
at pH 7.4. Thus, while tumor-like extracellular pH 6.5
alone did not induce considerable cell death, it appreciably
lowered intracellular pH and markedly enhanced CHCmediated cytotoxicity in MM cells. These results suggest
that extracellular as well as intracellular pH plays a role in
the cytotoxic effect of CHC.

A persistent issue in MM is effective targeting of
drug-resistant MM cells or MM progenitors, which is
associated with patient relapse and poor prognosis; new
avenues to address this would be beneficial.We previously
demonstrated that SP is a highly glycolytic fraction in MM
cells, and that inhibition of glycolysis preferentially targets
and reduces a SP fraction of MM cells and clonogenic
MM cells with colony formation [29]. Hexokinase II is
aberrantly overexpressed in cancer cells and mediates the
irreversible first step of glycolysis; it contributes to the

Warburg effect and is thought to prevent pro-apoptotic
proteins Bax and Bad from provoking cytochrome c
release in cancer cells, making it a metabolic target of
interest [35]. CHC treatment markedly reduced hexokinase
II expression in MM cells at mRNA and protein levels
(Figure 5A). Thus, treatment with CHC substantially
reduced the crucial glycolytic machinery hexokinase II in
MM cells. Together with ATP reduction by treatment with
CHC, CHC appears to target glycolysis enhanced in MM
cells. Importantly, CHC treatment nearly eradicated the
SP fractions of both RPMI8226 and KMS11 cells (Figure
5B), and also drastically reduced their colony formation
(Figure 5C), indicating effectiveness against clonogenic
MM cell populations implicated in patient relapse.

three of these molecules is most effective when targeting
MM cells (Figures 2 and 3).
Induction of intracellular acidosis correlated with
induction of cell death under treatment with CHC and/
or metformin (Figure 2), in agreement with previous
reports showing lowered intracellular pH to be conducive
to apoptosis triggering [38-42]. Furtheremore, tumor-like
extracellular acidic pH markedly enhanced CHC-mediated
cytotoxicity in MM cells. Therefore, MCT blockade is
suggested to be able to preferentially target tumor cells
endowed with drug resistance in lactate-abundant acidic
milieu or acidic bone-resorbing lesions in MM.
CHC-mediated attenuation of hexokinase II protein
levels and ATP levels suggests impairment of glycolytic
flux, an important source of energy and biomass in cancer
cells. Since intracellular acidification occurred acutely, it
is possible that CHC-induced lactate buildup plateaus at or
above a threshold where it may cause feedback inhibition
of glygolitic machinery [43]. Furthermore, hexokinase
II supports cell survival by inhibiting formation of the
permiability transition pore in the outer mitochondrial
membrane and preventing release of apoptosis-inducing
cytochrome c [35, 44]. Thus, various factors including
intracellular acidification, impaired energy production,
and loss of anti-apoptotic hexokinase II may contribute to
the mechanism of how CHC caused cell death in MM cells
and their progenitors.
The upregulation of BCRP expression and function
is a mechanism responsible for formation of the clonogenic
SP and development of drug resistance. Considering
the aforementioned effect of CHC on MM cell energy
levels and hexokinase II expression, it is plausible that
CHC-induced ATP paucity contributes to reduced (ATPdependent) BCRP function under these treatments, as
suggested by our previous work showing that inhibition
of glycolysis by 3-bromo-pyruvate suppresses ATP
production and restores drug sensitivity in BCRPexpressing RPMI8226 cells as well as p-glycoproteinexpressing KG1 leukemia and HepG2 hepatoma cells [29].
Inhibition of MCTs in MM cells attenuated
CXCR4 expression and potently suppressed rhSDF1α-induced migration in MM cells (Figure 6), implying
that intracellular acidification impairs the CXCR4/SDF1 signaling axis. If such an approach could disrupt MM
cell homing to the bone marrow niche in vivo, it may
deprive them of growth and survival signals provided by
osteoclasts and bone marrow stromal cells and enhance
their vulnerability to chemotherapeutic agents.
Finally, alternative approaches to disrupting lactate
transport in MM cells are also possible. For example,
monoclonal antibody directed against CD147 can inhibit
its association with MCT1 to curtail lactate transport and
reduce intracellular pH, ATP levels, and viability in cancer
cells [22]. The important contribution of CD147 to lactate
export [32] and cell proliferation [45] was also recently
shown in MM cells, suggesting the possibility of such an

CHC treatment attenuates CXCR4 expression
and chemotactic capabilities of MM cells
CXCR4 signaling potentiates homing of MM cells
up SDF-1 gradients to bone marrow microenvironments
that favor their survival and proliferation, and this has
attracted attention as a possible therapeutic target in MM
treatment [36]. In RPMI8226 and KMS11 cells, CHC
treatment attenuated CXCR4 at mRNA and surface protein
levels (Figure 6A and 6B). Whereas rhSDF-1α induced
substantial migration of RPMI8226 and KMS11 cells,
the presence of CHC along with rhSDF-1α resulted in
migration activity similar to controls that lacked rhSDF1α (Figure 6C). However, CHC only marginally affected
the migration of MM cells towards FBS (Figure 6C),
consistent with the hypothesis that the effect on migration
is mediated through disruption of the rhSDF-1α pathway,
per se.

DISCUSSION
It has been well established that aberrant metabolism
is one important phenotypic trait of cancer cells
distinguishing them from normal tissues and therefore
represents an attractive potential target with favorable
therapeutic index. The Warburg effect crucially contributes
to tumor biomass production and is such a reliable
hallmark of malignancy that it is the basis of the diagnostic
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDGPET) scan. Accordingly, MCT expression is known to be
upregulated in cancer cells to export lactate, a byproduct
of the Warburg effect, and lactate accumulation in
tumor milieus is associated with poor clinical outcomes
[18, 27, 37]. Secretion of excess lactate by cancer cells
contributes to acidosis of the tumor microenvironment,
which blunts anti-tumor immune responses [24-26]. MM
cells constitutively expressed MCT1 and MCT4, and
most expressed MCT2 (Figure 1A). Single knockdown of
MCT1, MCT2, or MCT4 by siRNA only slightly impaired
MM cell survival and function; however, blockade of all

The present work has shown that targeting the

potently effects cytotoxicity against drug-resistant, lactateexpelling MM cells and their progenitors. This approach
also decreased CXCR4 expression and migration in

investigations aimed at cancer metabolism and point

levels were measured by a microplate reader (Therm
Fisher Varioskan Flash; Waltham, MA).

Flow cytometry

Intracellular pH measurement

Cell preparation and staining for flow cytometry
were performed as described previously [6].
Approximately 1 × 106 cells were incubated in 100 µL
PBS with 2% human γ-globulin with a phycoerythrinconjugated monoclonal antibody on ice for 40 minutes and
then washed. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry
using EPICS-Profile (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL).

Cells (2 × 107 cells/mL) were cultured without
CO2 injection at 37°C in HEPES buffer for three
hours, followed by staining with BCECF-AM (final
concentration 1 μM) for 10 minutes. Cells were washed
and resuspended in HEPES buffer, and then fluorescence
intensities at wavelength 525 nm were measured by a
spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with excitation
wavelength either 488 nm or 439 nm (isosbestic point).
The ratio of the two fluorescence intensities was calculated
and compared to a calibration curve to calculate absolute
pH value. A calibration curve was constructed using
ratios of fluorescence intensity values obtained from cells
immediately after 10-minute incubation in pH-adjusted
high-potassium Na-MOPS calibration buffer (AppliChem,
Darmstadt, Germany) plus nigericin (final concentration
10 μg/mL).

SP analysis
A SP analysis was performed as previously
described [46]. Briefly, cells were incubated with 5 µg/
mL Hoechst33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for
90 minutes at 37°C in PBS containing 3% FBS in the
presence or absence of 100 µM verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO). Then, the cells were washed and incubated
with propidium iodide (1 µg/mL) to discriminate dead
cells. SP fractions were analyzed by flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter, Tokyo, Japan).

Intracellular pH imaging

Western blotting

Cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) were cultured for three
hours, followed by staining with BCECF-AM (final
concentration 1 μM). Cells were washed, resuspended
in HEPES buffer, and photographed using a fluorescence
microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with emission
wavelength 525/50 nm (range of 500 nm to 550 nm) and
excitation wavelength either 488 nm or 405 nm. Colorcoded ratio images were produced from this data to show
pH change.

Cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (Cell
Signaling, Beverly, MA) supplemented with 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor
cocktail solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cell
lysates were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE gel
and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by washing and
addition of a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection
Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were
purchased from Invitrogen (Stealth Select RNAi).
The sequences of oligonucleotides synthesized
for templates are as follow: MCT1 siRNA,
5’-CAGCAGUAUCCUGGUGAAUAAAUAU-3’ and
5’-AUAUUUAUUCACCAGGAUACUGCUG-3’; MCT2
siRNA, 5’-GAAAUGUCAUUAUGUUCCUAGGUUU-3’

concentration of 200 nM of each siRNA was transfected
into cells (2×106 cells) by electroporation using a Human
Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol.
