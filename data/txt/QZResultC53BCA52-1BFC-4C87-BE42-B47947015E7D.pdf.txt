ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer co-opts a unique set of cellular pathways in its initiation and
progression. The heterogeneity of prostate cancers is evident at earlier stages,
and has led to rigorous efforts to stratify the localized prostate cancers, so that
progression to advanced stages could be predicted based upon salient features of
the early disease. The deregulated androgen receptor signaling is undeniably most
important in the progression of the majority of prostate tumors. It is perhaps because
of the primacy of the androgen receptor governed transcriptional program in prostate
epithelium cells that once this program is corrupted, the consequences of the ensuing
changes in activity are pleotropic and could contribute to malignancy in multiple ways.
Following localized surgical and radiation therapies, 20-40% of patients will relapse
and progress, and will be treated with androgen deprivation therapies. The successful
development of the new agents that inhibit androgen signaling has changed the
progression free survival in hormone resistant disease, but this has not changed the
almost ubiquitous development of truly resistant phenotypes in advanced prostate
cancer. This review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular pathways
involved in localized and metastatic prostate cancer, with an emphasis on the clinical
implications of the new knowledge.

INTRODUCTION

patients.
At the other end of the spectrum in localized PCa
is the category of men presenting with either a high risk
localized cancer or with metastatic disease. These are
usually treated aggressively with any of the following:
prostatectomy, radiation therapy and/or androgen
deprivation therapies (ADT), which have been expanded
in recent years to include novel substantially more
efficient drugs. Nevertheless, even with newest ADT
drugs, the outcome involves nearly inevitable progression
to castrate resistant disease (CRPC), metastases and death.
Moreover, a meta-analysis of primary ADT treatment
provided conclusive evidence on the lack of survival
benefit from PADT for most men with clinically localized
prostate cancer [2].
The genetic landscape of prostate cancer was
intensely explored in the last few years with NGS, whole
genome expression analyses and analyses of epigenetic
alterations. These findings, along with the results from

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a complex multifaceted and
biologically heterogeneous disease. The majority of men
diagnosed with prostate cancer will benefit from not being
treated, because they have low volume indolent tumors
that do not require immediate treatment. Overtreatment
of localized PCA has become a serious problem, not
in the least because of serious health risks involved in
prostatectomy and other commonly used approaches.
Moreover, biochemical relapse occurs in about 30% of
patients who were treated aggressively.
To minimize overtreatment of patients with indolent
PCa, active surveillance is a reasonable and widely
accepted approach [1] for many patients. The recently
created and funded National Proactive Surveillance
Network (NPSN), provides for this approach, and also
aims to collect data and genetic sequences from biopsies
to identify the molecular signatures of PCa in low-risk

Stratification of localized PCa based on molecular
aberrations

genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) for PCa
initiation and progression revealed a number of features
not encountered in their entirety in other cancers. These
are:
•A relatively low rate of mutations in PCa compared
to other tumors.
• Prevalence of non-random copy number variations
(CNV) in most PCa tumors involving well-known prostate
oncogenes or tumor suppressors.
• Recurrent chromosomal rearrangements involving
ETS transcription factors, most frequently ERG, in 60 to
70% of PCa, which place these proteins under controls of
an androgen-dependent promoter.
• Complex nature of the genomic rearrangements
observed in PCa, with a pattern of balanced breaking and
rejoining (“close chain” pattern). The highly rearranged
PCa genomes are thought to evolve in a punctuated
manner, with translocations and deletions occurring
interdependently, via “chromoplexy” [3].
• Heavy involvement of developmental pathways
that govern prostate embryonic development in the
initiation and particularly progression to CRPC.
• The key role in prostate cancer of the epigenetic
changes such as chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation
and histone acetylation.
• The whole scale alterations in transcriptional
programs, in particular those governed by androgen
receptor (AR), and their prominent role in driving DNA
rearrangements and co-opting developmental pathways.
• Continuum of genetic somatic changes in PCa
from PIN (prostate intraepithelial neoplasia) to CRPC
(castrate resistant prostate cancer), i.e. increased frequency
of changes already existing in primary PCa as disease
progresses to CR stage, a well as development of new
somatic aberrations in CRPC.
The most common known genomic alterations in
PCa involve four pathways/genes: the androgen receptor
pathway, PI3K pathway, rearrangements that place
members of the ETS transcription factor family under
control of androgen responsive promoter TMPRSS2, and
loss of function of the prostate tumor suppressor NKX3.1.
The other somatic alterations and pathways involved
in PCa are listed in Table 1. This review first describes
somatic genetic events associated with localized disease,
attempting to stratify the subtypes based on presence of
ETS fusions, and describing the mutations thought to be
“drivers” in the ETS fusion negative PCa. PI3K pathway
involvement is also described in the section on localized
PCa, even though its frequency is increased in CRPC.
AR pathway aberrations in localized PCa do not typically
involve AR itself, and the latter are detailed in the CRPC
section.

Risk stratification of localized PCa is a high priority,
with an overarching goal of identifying groups of patients
who will benefit from aggressive treatment approaches
versus those whose disease will remain indolent for years
and who are good candidates for active surveillance or
even no intervention at all. Ideally, it should perform
better than the current histopathological/clinical grading
(Gleason score in combination with tumor size, lymph
node involvement, metastases, and PSA levels). However,
the identification of molecular subtypes that drive
differential prognoses in localized PCa was and remains
a challenge.
Localized PC could be (relatively but not entirely
arbitrary) subdivided in two categories based on presence/
absence of TMPRSS2-ERG or other changes in ETS
family genes (Figure 1). ETS family fusions are found in
up to 60% of PCa, and the fusion-negative group could be
divided into several subtypes based on results of the recent
NGS studies that have identified new genetic aberrations
in this group.
TMPRSS2-ERG and other rearrangements involving
ETS family
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion [4] is a result of
interchromosomal rearrangement that occurs in 40 to
60% of prostate cancers. Other members of ETS family of
transcription factors, of which ERG is a member, are also
involved in rearrangements, albeit much less frequently
(Figure 1). This is the most frequent chromosomal
rearrangement found in solid tumors, and perhaps in
human cancer in general, considering the high incidence of
PCa. Fusions appear to be an early event, found already in
PIN, and the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is thought
to be sufficient for the initiation of prostate intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN) [5]. Increased expression of ERG or
other ETS factors under control of androgen responsive
promoter (TMPRSS2) is an inevitable consequence of the
fusion events, and it activates transcriptional program that
contributes to oncogenesis by upregulating expression of,
among others, MYC, EZH2 and SOX9 and repressing
NKX3.1 [6-8]. The net result of high levels of ETS
expression is prevention of the differentiation of prostate
epithelium that is normally governed by AR.
Patients with expression of ERG in high-grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia are more likely to
develop prostate cancer. [9]. Expression of TMPRSS2ERG fusion shows a striking correlation with AR
expression in tumor biopsies [10]. It is of significant
interest that formation of fusions involving ERG genes
has been shown to be facilitated by signaling from the
AR, which induces proximity of the TMPRSS2 and ERG
genomic loci. Both are located on chromosome 21q22,
and fusion occurs via double-stranded DNA breaks [11].

In general, ERG-rearrangement positive cases contained
DNA breakpoints located near AR binding sites, whereas
ETS-negative prostate cancers harbored breakpoints
significantly distant from AR binding sites [12]. Androgen
signaling plays a direct role in generation of ERG fusions.
Once the TMPRSS2 and ERG loci are rendered proximal,
AR facilitates the fusion by inducing recruitment of two
types of enzymatic activities - cytidine deaminase and the
LINE-1 repeat-encoded ORF2 endonuclease [13]. These
induce double stranded DNA breaks that are ligated by
nonhomologous end joining [13]. It is also of great interest
that prevalence of ETS fusions is very high in the earlyonset prostate cancer (EO-PCa), defined as PCa diagnosed
in patients under 50 years of age [14]. The patients with
EO-PCa have higher expression of AR, and 90% of the
analyzed tumors from these patients had ERG fusions
and deletions of AR co-repressor NCOR2. In the older
patients with lower levels of AR, structural rearrangements
involved loci such as TAK1, PTEN, CHD1 that are not
known to be androgen-dependent [14]. These findings
indicate that AR signaling raises the probability of certain
DNA rearrangements, and those involving ERG or
other ETS factors and androgen responsive elements in
TMPRSS2 are favored in cells with increased androgen
signaling.
Because ETS transcription factors in fusion-positive
tumors are expressed from an androgen-dependent
promoter, their levels are significantly higher in these
tumors. This is, no doubt, related to the biological role of
ERG and other ETS in PCa. However, TMPRSS2-ERG
expression was shown to persist in castration resistant
prostate epithelial subpopulations which indicates
that its expression might not be driven by androgen
exclusively [15]. Presence of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is
a clear promoting event in PCa because activation of a
number of oncogenic pathways is highly enriched in
tumors with TMPRSS2-ERG2 rearrangement. Thus,
TMPRSS2-ERG and PTEN loss cooperate in the relevant
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) [16, 17].
TMPRSS2-ERG cooperates with activated AKT and
overexpressed AR but not with loss of TP53 in transition
to PCa from PIN in GEMM [18]. A conditional GEMM
overexpressing ERG in prostate shows major upregulation
of the AR cistrom when combined with PTEN loss [19].
Constitutively expressed ERG reprograms genome-wide
localization of AR and prostate epithelium to respond to
PTEN loss [19].
TMPRSS2-ERG expression induces repressive
epigenetic programs by upregulating expression of the
EZH2, a Polycomb group protein [20]. Overexpressed
ERG in PCa shows an extraordinary degree of
transcriptional co-opting of androgen receptor, with a
consequence of inhibiting AR-mediated differentiation
and promoting EZH2-mediated dedifferentiation [20].
Paradoxically, upregulation of EZH2 is also achieved,
though by different means, in ETS fusion negative PCa
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(see below, under EZH2). High levels of ETS factors
in fusion-positive PCa activate a transcription program
characterized by enrichment of RAS-responsive elements,
therefore functionally replacing activation of the RASMAPK pathway [21].
Deregulation of WNT and TGFβ signaling pathways
was also found to be associated with TMPRSS2-ERG
fusion [22]. As an oncogenic transcription factor, ERG
mediates striking non-random alterations in chromatin
structure thus enabling and promoting genomic
rearrangements through its effects on chromatin structure
[23]. On its own, presence of ETS fusions does not show
striking correlations with the disease course, even though
some publications have reported association with a more
aggressive disease. However, overexpressed ETS proteins
probably act as an “enabler” for further carcinogenic
genomic changes that drive the fully transformed
phenotype. In terms of prognostic significance, ERG
fusions are strongly associated with high AR signaling
in the early onset PCa, a particularly aggressive group of
PCa, that is thought to be driven by high levels of AR [14].
Other members of ETS family were also implicated
in PCa via chromosomal rearrangements. ETV1 activation
in a mouse models appears to have consequences for
AR transcription that are different from those induced
by translocated ERG: ETV1 largely cooperates with the
AR transcriptional program, and promotes autonomous
testosterone production [24]. ETV1-positive tumors
have a very poor outcome [24]. ETV4 is involved in
translocations with TMPRSS2 in PCa less often [25],
and, as seen in a GEMM, while ETV4 expression appears
not to affect tumor growth per se, it induces metastatic
progression in cooperation with activated PI3K pathway
[26]. In human PCa, ETV4 overexpression correlates with
activation of PI3K and RAS signaling [26].
Treatment implications. Currently there are no
drugs targeting ETS family transcription factors. In
preclinical studies a compound WP1130, inhibitor of
deubiquinating enzyme USP9X was shown to restrain
growth of prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo by promoting
degradation of ERG protein [27].
It was suggested that ETS fusion positive PCa
patients could benefit from treatment with poly (ADPribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors because
TMPRSS2:ERG interacts in a DNA-independent manner
with PARP-1 and the catalytic subunit of DNA protein
kinase (DNA-PKcs). Moreover, these interactions are
essential for the transcriptional program of ETS factors
[28]. A randomized phase II trial NCT01576172 of PARP1 inhibitor ABT-888/veliparib or placebo with abiraterone
in fusion-positive patients with mCRPC has started to
recruit patients. Another PARP-1 inhibitor, olaparib, is
tested in a phase II trial NCT01682772 in UK, and this
trial includes evaluation of defects in DNA repair genes
in patients. A novel PARP inhibitor BMH 673 is in early
testing in various tumors with DNA repair deficiencies,

accompanying driver mutations in a relatively small subset
of T/E positive tumors with normal PI3K/PTEN status.
Aberrations of PI3K pathway contribute to
development of the castration-resistance in PCa, at least
in GEMM. Castration-resistant growth is an intrinsic
property of Pten null prostate cancer cells, independent
of cancer development stage [42]. Deletion of AR in
PTEN null epithelium promoted proliferation of PTEN
null cells and lead to the activation of Akt. Activated PI3K/
AKT pathway is sufficient to compensate for androgen/
AR-signaling blockade by inducing proliferation of basal/
progenitor cells and enhancing expression of a number
of pro-proliferative factors including EGR1, c-JUN,
and EZH2 [42]. A recently discovered consequence of
PI3K activation is accumulation of esterified cholesterol
in of high-grade prostate cancer, whose significance is
underlined by the finding that depletion of this form of
cholesterol diminishes proliferation of PCa cells ([43].
In humans, numerous studies demonstrated the
association between PTEN loss and worse prognosis,
including shortened PFS [44] in particular in ERG
positive cancers [45], increased risk of relapse [46] and
development of metastases [47, 48].
Castration or treatment with Enzalutamide (AR
antagonist) in a GEMM of high grade (HG) PIN that
develops in absence of PTEN resulted in rapid progression
of the otherwise stable HG-PIN to CRPC [49]. However,
targeting PI3K rather than AR pathway in this model
with BEZ235 (PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor) resolved the
HG-PIN phenotype. Moreover, concurrent inhibition of
MAPK and PI3K in PTEN null CRPC that developed
after castration was effective in inhibiting growth of
these tumors. These findings have serious implications
for the androgen deprivation therapies used currently for
treatment of prostate cancer.
Treatment implications. More and more evidence
suggest that ADT benefits are reduced in PCa with PI3K
activation [42, 49], and that combining ADT with PI3K
pathway inhibition is significantly more efficient, at least
in GEMM, most likely by inhibiting the crosstalk between
the two pathways. PI3K inhibitors are clinically tested in
CRPC, and some trials are exploring the combination of
PI3K pathway inhibition with ADT (see below, under
CRPC). In a phase II trial NCT01695473 BKM120 will
be given to patients with high risk PCa as a neoadjuvant,
for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy. This trial will
also test the effect of this drug on activity of AKT, 4eBP
and s6 kinase in the tumor samples.
A recent report on failure of mTOR inhibitor
temsirolimus in mCRPC patients suggests that a single
targeted therapy is not sufficient to have an impact on the
course of this disease [50]. The fact that patients accrued
into this trial were not pre-screened for the activation of
mTOR pathway could have contributed to its failure to
reach its endpoints.

Activation of PI3K pathway
Activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)
pathway, most often through PTEN copy losses occurs in
50% of PCa, and appears to be an early change, found
already in PIN. PTEN is a phosphatase that is a well
known as a tumor suppressor downregulating the PI3K
pathway activity. PTEN deletions and/or mutations are
found in 30% of primary prostate cancers [29] and 63%
of metastatic prostate tissue samples [30], placing PTEN
mutation among the most common genetic alterations
reported in human prostate cancers. Monoallelic losses are
more common in PIN and localized PCa, while bi-allelic
PTEN losses are higher in frank PCa and particularly in
CRPC. Moreover, homozygous loss of PTEN is causative
in progression to aggressive metastatic phenotype and
castration resistance [31]. ETS fusion positive tumors
are enriched for PTEN loss, while the fusion-negative
tumors have less frequent PTEN losses. There is a strong
oncogenic interaction between high levels of ERG and
PTEN loss (described above, in the TMPRSS2-ERG
section).
Other components of the PI3K pathway are also
infrequently altered in PCa, such as mutations in PIK3
itself, in phosphatases other than PTEN - INPP4B and
PHLPP [32], or in PTEN interacting proteins MAGI2/3
[12]. MAGI proteins support the PTEN phosphatase
activity and the following suppression of AKT activation.
The functional relevance of these alterations remains to
be verified.
Studies in GEMM strongly confirmed the role of
PTEN in prostate carcinogenesis. The monoallelic ablation
of PTEN in prostates of adult mice is sufficient to induce
PIN that do not, however, progress to cancer [33]. These
mice develop invasive tumors when genetic background
includes a monoallelic inactivation of NKX3.1[34, 35].
PTEN null engineered mouse tumors are indolent and
non-invasive, and additional events - such as aberrant
expression of ERG [17, 36], inactivation of TP53 [37,
38] or activation of MYC [38, 39] - are needed to confer
aggressive phenotype to these tumors. This could be
related to the findings that loss of PTEN promotes a
senescence response that prevents further development of
malignant phenotype [40]. Additional alterations in PTEN
deficient PCa, such as ablation of SMAD4 (key effector
in TGF-β pathway) serve to overcome this senescence,
leading to the development of aggressive tumors with
100% penetrance [41].
Genetic changes leading to activation of PI3K
pathway through various mechanisms (PTEN copy loss,
MAGI2/3 mutations, PIK3CA mutations) are enriched in
tumors positive for ETS fusions. Well-supported evidence
exists, mostly from GEMM, of cooperation between ETS
aberrations and PIK3CA pathway in development of PCa
(see above). Not much information is available about the

Driver mutations in ETS fusion negative PCa

Inactivation of CHD1 in vitro prevents formation of ERG
rearrangements due to impairment of androgen receptor
(AR)-dependent transcription, a prerequisite for ERG
translocation, which explains the mutual exclusivity of
ERG rearrangements and CHD1 loss [62].
SPINK1 overexpression, found in 5-10% of PCa is
mutually exclusive with ERG rearrangements [63] and
strongly associated with copy loss of PTEN but normal
copy number of AR in CRPC [64]. Recently, SPINK
expression and ERG negative status was shown to be
not mutually exclusive [65]. SPINK1 encodes a secreted
serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1 that might involve
EGFR in its tumorigenic effects, and defines an aggressive
subtype of PCa [66]. SPINK+ETS- tumor xenografts
were responsive not only to treatment with anti-SPINK1
antibody, but also to anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab,
indicating a potential treatment option.
Methylation of miR-26a. ETS fusion negative PCa
frequently are hypermethylated at the miR-26a locus
[67]. Systematic analysis of methylated regions in fusionpositive versus fusion negative PCa revealed a much
higher methylation of certain functional groups in the
fusion-negative cancers, including homeobox proteins.
High expression of histone methyltransferase EZH2
(see below) was implicated in this selective methylation
process. The high levels of EZH2 are, in turn, a
consequence of methylation of miR-26a selectively in the
fusion negative PCa [68]. In early PCa, Myc negatively
regulates miR-26a and miR-26b via direct binding to their
promoters, and also directly activates expression of EZH2
[69].
MAP3K7/TAK1. Deletion mapping of locus 6q1222, one of the most commonly deleted loci in PCa has
narrowed it to 6q15 and identified MAP3K7 as one of
five genes present within it [70]. TAK1 was deleted in
32% of 95 tumors analyzed, and deletions correlated
significantly with high Gleason score. This TGF-activated
kinase was proposed to be a putative prostate cancer
tumor suppressor based on functional studies showing
that attenuation of TAK1 expression lead to increased
proliferation and metastases [71]. A very recent study
involving a large number of interpretable tumors [72]
showed a strong association of allelic loss of MAP3K7
with ETS rearrangement negative status of tumors, though
it was found in some ERG fusion positive tumors as well.
In both situations, the deletion (found in about 20% of
PCa) was associated with advanced tumor stage, lymph
node involvement and shortened survival. It is of interest
that TAK1 was shown previously to play an essential role
in the LKB1/AMPK pathway of energy sensing and, thus,
in cellular metabolism [73].

Until recently, the driver mutations in ETS fusionnegative PCa were unknown. In the last year or two, a
number of genomic aberrations that occur selectively in
ETS fusion-negative PCa were identified, mostly through
use of NGS and analysis of epigenetic alteration.
SPOP mutations (6-15% of PCa) appear to
represent a genetic subclass of PCa of its own. Mutations
in SPOP are mutually exclusive with the ETS family
rearrangements and rarely have accompanying mutations
in PTEN or PIK3CA or TP53 in localized cancers. SPOP
mutations define a subgroup of PCa with poor prognosis
[51]. They are strongly associated with copy loss of
CHD1/5q21.1 and copy losses of 6q21 containing loci for
FOXO3 and PRDM1 [51]. In general, SPOP mutations
are associated with higher frequency of CNVs. Even
though SPOP mutations in localized PCa show an inverse
relationship with PTEN and PI3K pathway alterations,
they do co-occur more frequently in metastatic tumors
[51]. SPOP is a POZ domain adaptor protein that forms
a complex with CULLIN3 E3 ubiquitin ligase, and it was
initially shown to ubiquitinate and induce degradation of
SRC-3/AIB1, a cofactor of AR necessary for its activity
[52]. This is a strong indication that SPOP loss of function
deregulates activity of AR already in localized PCa. PCaassociated mutant versions of SPOP protein are unable
to bind to SRC-3 and trigger its degradation [53] thereby
validating the tumor suppressing role of SPOP. Recently it
was shown that SPOP recognizes a degron within the hinge
domain of AR and promotes degradation of AR but not of
PCa associated splicing variants that lack hinge domain
[54]. SPOP mutants do not activate degradation of AR
[54]. SPOP also promotes degradation of Gli2 and Gli3,
transcription factors in Hedgehog (Hh) developmental
pathway, which contributes to castrate resistant phenotype
(see below). This indicates that mutations in SPOP might
lead to inappropriate activation of Hh pathway [55-57].
SPOP and Cullin3 E3 ubiquitin ligase also ubiquitinate
the Polycomb group protein BMI1 [58]. Considering the
role of BMI1 expression in CRPC (below), increased
stability of this protein resulting from SPOP inactivation
could be yet another contributor to aggressive character of
SPOP mutant PCa. In addition, a single report suggested
that SPOP expression might be lost in as many as 37% of
PCa [59]. Therefore, SPOP is a tumor suppressor that is
uniquely placed to deregulate, when mutated, the androgen
signaling and three developmental pathways instrumental
in prostate development and carcinogenesis.
CHD1. Loss of this chromatin remodeler occurs
in 5-10 % of PCa, exclusively in ETS fusion negative
tumors, and is frequently associated with mutations of
SPOP [51, 60]. CHD1 might be involved in in prevention
of chromosomal deletions. Loss of CHD1 in clinical
specimens is significantly associated with an increased
number of additional chromosomal deletions, both hemiand homozygous, especially on 2q, 5q and 6q [61].

nature of the initiating oncogenic signal. As an example,
ablation of AR in GEMM prevents development of PIN
by FGF10 signaling (paracrine), but ablation of AR in
GEMM does not prevent induction of PIN by activated
Akt [74].
Even though AR itself is never altered in primary
PCa, about half of localized tumors harbor alterations in
several of AR transcriptional cofactors/regulators [75].
Among them, NCOR2, a negative regulator of AR, is
mutated in 23% of primary PCa; no increase in frequency
of mutations is observed in metastatic PCa. The frequency
of mutations in NCOR1 rises from 4% in primary to
16% in metastatic [75]. Activator NCOA2 is amplified in
8% of primary and 37% of metastatic, and NCOA1 in 4

and 11% respectively. Increased levels of NCO2 confer
an increased AR transcriptional output even in presence
of low levels of androgens. Several other cofactors and
regulators of AR have been shown to be altered by copy
number alterations [75].

Other recurrent molecular aberrations in
localized PCa
NKX3.1 is frequently mutated or lost in localized
PCa. The current understanding of the consequences of the
loss of function of this tumor suppressor will be discussed
in the section on metastatic CRPC, because frequency of
7224

Oncotarget

NKX3.1 inactivation is much higher in advanced tumors,
and because it is a gene essential in developmental
processes that are discussed separately below.
Classical tumor suppressors: inactivation of TP53,
CDKN1B (p27/KIP), RB1 occurs infrequently in primary
PCa, but is much more common in CRPC.
MED12 is mutated in 5% of prostate cancer
[51]. It is a known tumor suppressor mutated in 70%
of leyomyosarcomas [76], and is a component of the
mediator complex. MED12 was recently found to
inactivate TGFβR signaling and control response to
several drugs in different cancer models [77]. Mutations of
MED12 confer resistance to multiple anti-cancer therapies
including conventional chemo and targeted therapies.
MYC overexpression is observed in PIN [78] and
in primary PCa [79]. It has been reported that MYC is
activated by the TMPRSS22-ERG rearrangement in cell
culture and animal models [8]. MYC stability is regulated
indirectly by the ubiquitin specific protein USP2a that is
upregulated in 44% of prostate cancers [80, 81]. USP2a
mediates suppression of miRNA cluster miR-34a/b and
consequently upregulates MYC [82]. MYC is subject
to many levels of regulation, and more the one of these
are reportedly disrupted in PCa. MYC is phosphorylated
and negatively regulated by PKCζ, a kinase with tumorsuppressing properties that is downregulated in some
prostate tumors [83].
CADM2 is nectin-like member of the
immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules with
expression reduced in PCa [84] and disrupted by
rearrangements in 3 of 7 primary tumors sequenced and in
6 from an additional set of 90 [12]. The role of CADM2 in
PCa development is not understood.

circulating testosterone, an understanding that has driven
development of the second generation of anti-androgens.
In general, it is thought that the role of AR in castration
resistant cancer cells is not to direct the androgendependent gene expression program without androgen, but
rather to execute a distinct program resulting in androgenindependent growth [85].
Potential mechanisms by which AR reactivation
occurs in CRPC include variable levels of AR gene
amplification (30% of cases or higher), activating AR
mutations, activating alternative mRNA splicing (10-25%),
increased expression or activation of AR transcriptional
coactivators, increased intratumoral androgen synthesis,
activation of modulatory kinase pathways and noncoding
RNAs (see below). All these alterations lead to sustained
androgen receptor signaling in presence of castrate serum
levels of androgen. The array of different mechanisms
that contribute to activation of AR in CRPC is extremely
diverse.
Aberrations in AR itself. Amplification of AR
[86] occurs in about 30% of CRPC. Focal amplification
of AR might predate ADT in PCA since clonal foci are
found in small percentage of treatment naïve patients
and are predictive of poor prognosis [87] Activating
mutations are observed in 10% to 30% CRPC and confer
enhanced survival in absence/low levels of androgens
[88]. Treatment with antiandrogens selects for gain-offunction AR mutations with altered stability, promoter
preference, or ligand specificity as shown in a number of
studies [89, 90]. A striking example of the selection for
AR mutations was shown in a study that sequenced AR in
bone marrow metastases of CRPC developed after therapy
with flutamide. Mutations were found in 5 of 16 patients,
and they conferred upon AR the ability to be stimulated
by flutamide [90].
More recently, a mutagenesis screen identified a
mutation F876L in AR that could convert the second
generation AR antagonist enzalutamide into an agonist.
This works also identified compounds that could
antagonize AR F876L [91]. F876L mutation was identified
independently in cell lines selected for resistance to
enzalutamide or ARN-509 in two other studies [92, 93],
and F876L mutation was identified in plasma DNA of
progressing patients [92]. These findings suggest that
the potential of the long-term benefit from the secondgeneration antiandrogens may be reduced in the presence
of resistance mutations.
Another common mode of AR activation involves
alternative splicing in AR [94, 95], leading to ligandindependent activation or reduced requirement for
androgens due to the lack of ligand binding domain in
these variant AR proteins [96]. Alternatively spliced
constitutively active AR expression is increased in cells
treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone [97, 98], while
the full length AR is repressed [97].
Genomic rearrangements within the AR locus were

Genetic landscape of metastatic PCA and CRPC:
pathways significantly activated or deregulated
compared to localized disease
CRPC is characterized by massive accumulation of
genomic and epigenetic alterations involving a number
of developmental, signal transduction pathways as well
as oncogenes and tumor suppressor controlled pathways
(Table 2). These alterations are most likely driven by
the disregulated AR program and by ADT that is almost
universally used in patients with aggressive and metastatic
disease. Clearly, the AR program plays a critical role in
PCa progression.
Androgen receptor pathway
AR pathway is a driving force in CRPC, as seen
from its deregulation in vast majority of these cancers.
As described above, a significant number of localized
cancers have perturbations in AR associated regulators
and co-factors, but not in AR [75]. However, AR itself
is altered in 60% of CRPC [60, 75]. It is clear now that
AR is activated in CRPC despite of castrate levels of

discovered that prevent expression of full-length receptor
but produce truncated versions lacking the androgen
binding domain. These truncated proteins maintain the
AR transcriptional program constitutively and in a truly
androgen independent manner [99].
• Posttranslational modifications of AR. Multiple
modifications of AR by phosphorylation, sumoylation,
methylation and acetylation have been reported in the
literature (reviewed in [100]), many of which have
consequences on AR stability and activity. Tyrosine
phosphorylation of AR has been reported [101]; it appears
to be accomplished by a number of different kinases [102104] and is important for tumor growth under androgen
depleted conditions.
• Somatic genetic changes in components of AR
transcriptional co-regulators leading to an increased and/
or changed output of AR activity. Mutational inactivation
of inhibitory factors NCOR1, NCOR1 and NRIP1, and
activating changes in NCOA1, NCOA2 and TNK2 are
observed in primary cancers but are much more frequent
in metastatic [75]. AR accessory transcription factor
FOXA1 is mutated in about 5% of CRPC [60], and is
described under “Developmental Pathways”.
• Intratumoral androgen synthesis is increased
through elevated endogenous expression of enzymes in
the androgen synthesis pathways in tumors (CYP11B1
and A1, HSD17B2, AKR1C3 and others) or conversion
of circulating low affinity adrenal androgens to
DHT [105-107]. Androgen deprivation promotes
intratumoral synthesis of dihydrotestosterone from
androgen metabolites [108]. There are suggestions
that reactive inflamed prostate cancer stroma may
contribute to increased intratumoral androgens [109].
Recently, the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
type 1(3β HSD1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting
step in conversion of the adrenal-derived steroid
dehydroepiandrosterone to DHT, was found to be
sometimes mutated in prostate cancer. The mutation
N367T does not affect enzymatic activity but produces
a protein resisting degradation and thus accumulating at
high levels [110].
• Upregulation of AR signaling through activation
of modulatory kinase pathways and AR phosphorylation.
The cooperation of activated PI3K pathway in AR
signaling was mentioned above in the section describing
PTEN deletions. Signaling by activated Akt (as a results
of PTEN loss) and ERK promote hormone-independent
but AR dependent growth of PCa cells and tumors [111].
In addition, numerous publications reported that other
kinases, such as Src, Pim and Aurora A are involved
in progression to CRPC. Src family kinases have a
tumorigenic potential in PCa in models [112, 113]. Kinase
activities of EGFR, ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EPHA-2),
JAK2, ABL1 and SRC are increased in PCa as seen from
the analysis of the phosphotyrosine peptide enrichment
[114]. The IL6-IL6R signaling leading to activation of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

JAK1 - STAT3 pathway is also involved, whereby STAT3
interacts with AR and enables recruitment of p300 to AR
transcriptional complex [115, 116]. Extracellular growth
factors - EGF, IGF, FGF10 and others – could also lead
to transactivation of AR through receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) engagement leading to activation of PI3K and
MAPK pathways. EGFR, in particular, is overexpressed
in many PCa [117], and FGF receptors are involved in
paracrine signaling involving modulation of AR activity
(see below). MAPK pathway is frequently deregulated in
metastatic PCa and CRPC and activates AR-dependent
transcription [118].
• Regulation of AR degradation. Numerous
publications describe multiple mechanisms of maintaining
the stability of AR in CRPC. E3 ubiquitin ligases Mdm2
[119] and CHIP [120] have been implicated in the
control of AR. Phosphorylation of AR by kinases could
alternatively recruit ubiquitin ligases for degradation
or prevent their binding for increased stability. Certain
mutations in AR in CRPC serve to promote the stability
of protein by modifying amino acid residues necessary
for receptor ubiquitination or sumoylation and following
degradation. Ubiquitin ligase Siah2 is involved in
targeting for degradation a select pool of NCOR1-bound,
transcriptionally-inactive AR, which promotes expression
of select AR target genes implicated in lipid metabolism,
cell motility, and proliferation [121].

Treatment approaches

deregulated AR

Targeting AR, androgen synthesis and AR cofactors. AR is the primary treatment target in PCa. The
development of novel therapies to achieve androgen
deprivation in prostate cancer patients has improved the
outlook for patients with advanced-stage and castrationresistant prostate cancer. However, in majority of patients
the beneficial effects are self-limited, though some patients
derive a long term or even life long benefit.
In the recent decade or so, it was realized that
some CRPCs remain hormone-dependent in spite of the
very low levels of circulating androgens, due to some
of the mechanisms described above. That led to the
development and FDA approval of the new generation of
drugs such as Abiraterone (inhibitor of enzyme CYP17
in the androgen synthesis pathway) and enzalutamide
(selective AR inhibitor), with more in development (Table
2). Abiraterone has a much improved efficacy compared
to the “old” second line drugs, and brings significant
benefits to patients with CRPC [122]. A clinical study
has shown that pro-survival benefits of abiraterone are
strongly associated with higher serum androgens levels at
the baseline (prior to treatment) [123], however clinical
benefit accrued to all patient subgroups. Therefore serum
androgen measurements are not useful in prospectively
7226

Oncotarget

selecting patients for abiraterone therapy.
TOK-001, another CYP17 inhibitor in development,
not only inhibits CYP17, but also target the AR receptor
itself to prevent binding of androgens or even induce AR
degradation [124]. Orteronel (TAK-700) is an inhibitor
of steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase in testes and adrenal
gland, and has shown a promising activity in nonmetastatic CRPC inducing marked and durable declines
in PSA [125].
Enzalutamide has shown efficacy in CRPC patients
whose disease progressed after chemotherapy [126] and
in chemotherapy naïve patients whose disease progressed
after ADT [127]. Similar to enzalutamide, a novel AR
antagonist ARN-509 inhibits AR nuclear translocation and
AR binding to androgen response elements, and has shown
a promising clinical activity in CRPC [128]. ODM-201 is
also an AR antagonist that facilitates formation of inactive
AR complexes unable to translocate to the nucleus. ODM201 has shown a good safety profile and activity in CRPC
in a completed a phase I/II trial ([129].
Nevertheless, it is becoming apparent that ADT can
activate bypass pathways that can replace AR activity
in presence of AR blockade and promote anti-androgen
resistance. The recent demonstration that glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) is upregulated and activated in PCa models
involving continuous treatment with enzalutamide and
ARN-509 is a striking illustration of the adaptability of
PCa to ADT [130]. Moreover, activation of GR in this
setting confers resistance to enzalutamide most likely
by taking over the role of AR in transcriptional output
by activating a partially overlapping set of genes. This
finding, if confirmed in human cancers, may lead to reconsideration of the clinical use of corticosteroids in some
treatments regimens.
There is an opinion shared by a number of
researchers that many prostate cancers, in particular those
with deregulated signaling pathways such as PI3K, should
be treated with investigational therapies that target not
only AR but these signaling pathways as well [131] or
with differentiation inducing therapies [132]. The PI3K
inhibitors are in clinical development, and so are mTOR
inhibitors, but the latter did not show much efficacy in
PCa trials.
Therapeutic approaches to block activation of
signaling pathway in CRPC. Clinical trials are ongoing
that target growth factor receptors, some in combination
with ADT. Phase I/II NCT00953576 explores combination
of lapatinib, small molecule inhibitor of EGFR and HER2
with dutasteride, inhibitor of 5-a-reductase. Multi-RTK
inhibitor sunitinib and SRC family inhibitor dasatinib are
being evaluated in a randomized trial NCT01254864 with
abiraterone. Dasatinib versus placebo with abiraterone
is in an additional phase II trial NCT01685125. MTD
of dasatinib will be given to patients undergoing ADT
(abiraterone) and radiation therapy in phase I trial
NCT01826838 with the hope that inhibition of SRC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathway might overcome radioresistance.
IGF1R is targeted with a humanized monoclonal
antibody cixutumumab/IMC-A12. ADT (different drugs)
with or without cixutumumab is tested in randomized
phase II NCT01120236 for patients with newly diagnosed
mCRPC. Cixutumumab is combined with mTOR inhibitor
temsirolimus in phase I/II trial NCT01026623 for mCRPC.
Cabozantinib/XL184 is a multi-RTK inhibitor
with activity toward MET, VEGFR2 and other RTKs.
The rationale of using it in prostate and other cancers is
that it could potentially inhibit the angiogenic signaling
in endothelial cells and the oncogenic MET signaling in
tumor cells. Recent evidence shows that cabozantinib also
restrains the activity of osteoblasts therefore inhibiting
growth of bone metastases in mouse models [133].
Cabozantinib indeed has shown clinical activity by
improving PFS, and reducing both soft tissue and bone
lesions in CRPC [134]. Currently, cabozantinib is in a
dozen clinical trials for CRPC, including two phase III
trials, and early phase combination trials of cabozantinib
with abiraterone or other ADT drugs. Another MET
inhibitor, tivantinib, is in early testing for CRPC.
Other RTK inhibitors in clinical studies for CRPC
include PLX3397 (inhibitor of KIT, CSF1R and FLT3),
antiangiogenic axitinib and pazopanib (VEGFR and
PDGFR) and dovitinib (FGFRs and other RTKs).
Preclinical approaches to overcome resistance to
the newer ADT drugs. Introduction of abiraterone and
enzalutamide into clinical practice gave new options to
CRPC patients who had none before, but development of
resistance ultimately limits the impact of these agents. A
recent review described some of the clinical approaches to
forestall or overcome resistance to new ADT agents [135],
and intense preclinical efforts are made to discover new
options.
One approach relies on blocking interactions
of AR with its co-activators, which are essential for
the activation of the AR transcriptional program. A
peptidomimetic compound was designed that selectively
targets protein motif LXXLL critical for interaction
of AR with co-factors such as PELP-1, and showed a
promising preclinical activity [132]. A compound named
EPI-001 binds to the N-terminal domain of AR that is
also involved in interactions with coactivators CBP and
RAP74, and inhibits AR activity causing apoptosis [136,
137]. Another compound, pyrvinium pamoate, an FDA
approved anthelmintic drug, binds non-competitively to a
domain of AR that is distinct from ligand binding domain,
induces prostate atrophy in vivo [138] and maybe active
in the setting of ligand independent AR signaling [139].
A recent meeting report indicated that it has activity in
animal models of PCa (https://www.endocrine.org/).
Niclosamide, another anthelmintic drug approved
by FDA, was identified as a potent inhibitor of variant
alternatively spliced AR (AR-V7) that drives resistance to
enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells [140].
7227

Oncotarget

The recent demonstration of preclinical efficacy
of inhibiting bromodomain and extraterminal (BET)
proteins in different malignancies may be applicable in
CRPC. BET domain protein BRD4 was shown to interact
with the N-terminal domain of AR, and the BET domain
inhibitor JQ1 disrupts AR transcription program in vitro
and inhibited growth of CRPC in mouse models in vivo,
presenting a new epigenetic approach [141].
Targeting epigenetics turned out to be key to the
activity of a compound identified initially as a active in
a screen for drugs inhibiting translocations in prostate
cancer. SD70 inhibits the androgen-dependent AR
program, and prostate cancer cell growth, acting, at least
in part, by functionally inhibiting the Jumonji domaincontaining demethylase, KDM4C [142].
Based on the observation that enzalutamide
resistant PCa cells exhibit increased autophagy, a study of
autophagy inhibitors found that CRPC cells are sensitive
to their cytotoxic action in vitro and in vivo [143].

integrating AR and mTOR, is a viable target in PCa [145].
Therapeutic approaches to deregulated PI3K/
mTOR in CRPC. Active clinical research is being
undertaken to examine how inhibition of signaling
pathways initiated by activated receptor kinase and
mediated through the PI3K pathway might affect the
course of CRPC.
Of more than 20 experimental drugs with activity
against PIK3 kinase, three, BKM120, BEZ235 and GDC0980, are currently tested in several phase II clinical
trials selectively for PCa. Phase II trial NCT01385293 is
recruiting patients with mCRPC for a single arm study of
BKM120 at a pre-determined maximum tolerated dose.
Phase Ib NCT01634061 will examine combination of
either BKM120 or BEZ235 (a dual inhibitor of PI3K and
mTOR) with abiraterone in patients with CRPC. Similarly,
combination of BKM120 and abiraterone will be tested
in NCT01634061. BEZ235 is in another multicenter
trial with abiraterone, NCT01717898. Dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor GDC-0980 is tested in a randomized phase II
NCT01485861 with abiraterone. Several other PI3K
inhibitors are in early clinical testing (dose escalation
studies) for various cancers, including prostate.
AKT inhibitor GDC-0068 is tested in a randomized
phase II trial NCT01485861 with abiraterone. The phase II
randomized trial NCT01251861 testing bicalutamide alone
or bicalutamide with AKT inhibitor MK2206 in patients
for previously treated PCa. AKT inhibitor AZD5363 is in
phase I testing, NCT01692262.
mTOR inhibitors everolimus and temsirolimus,
approved for other conditions, are in early clinical testing
in PCa. Combinations of temsirolimus with docetaxel
(NCT01206036) and with vorinostat (NCT01174199) are
in phase I testing. Everolimus with radiation treatment is
explored for biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy
NCT01548807, and as an add-on for patients undergoing
radiation treatment with ADT NCT01642732.

PI3K/mTOR pathway and AR program in CRPC
The role of the PI3K pathway in the development
of PCa and CRPC, and the reciprocal feedback regulation
of PI3K and AR activities in particular gained even more
importance in light of recent findings. Loss of PTEN
in PCa is apparently strongly co-operative with other
somatogenic changes in the development of the CRPC
phenotype. A co-clinical study of GEMM with PTEN
loss in prostate revealed that resistance to ADT on this
background develops only in presence of additional
alterations – in this scenario, loss of ZBTB7A or p53
[144]. This study conducted integrative acquisition of
data from the mouse model and human PCa samples
and identified changes that are associated with poor
response to ADT: downregulation of XAF1, inhibitor
of anti-apoptotic protein XIAP1, and upregulation of
SRD5A1 (involved in the conversion of testosterone to
DHT (stable form, dihydrotestosterone). Inhibition of
XIAP1 with embelin administered concurrently with
ADT (bicalutamide) inhibited proliferation of PCa in
mice with deletion of PTEN and Zbtb7A or Pten and
p53 [144]. Because corresponding changes were seen in
this co-clinical study of human PCa biopsies, it is likely
that combination of ADT with drugs targeting XIAP1 or
SDR5A1 (dutasteride) might be of therapeutic benefit in
this subset of PCa.
The second study has found that KLK4 (kallikrein
regulated peptidase) and PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia
zinc finger), two genes upregulated by AR, contribute
to integration of AR and mTOR signaling. KLK4, long
suspected as a player in PCa, apparently destabilizes
PLZF through direct interaction and therefore abrogates
the negative effects of PLZF on AR transcriptional activity
[145]. Moreover, this abrogates the upregulation by
PLZF of REDD1, a known inhibitor of mTORC1 [146],
therefore suggesting that KLK4, as a molecular switch

DNA damage repair in CRPC and its association with
AR activity
Defects in DNA damage repair (DDR) in CRPC.
Mutations in the well-known DDR genes have been
reported in CRPC and in localized aggressive cancers.
Mutations of BRCA2 were identified in about 2% of
sporadic PCa, but germline mutations in BRCA2 increase
risk of PCa at younger age (<55 years) manifold [147].
Absolute risk of prostate cancer in BRCA2 carriers is 15%
by age of 65 years, or 8.6 fold increase [148]. A different
study has identified mutations and loss of BRCA2 in 12%
of PCa [149]. BRCA1 has also been associated with an
increased risk of sporadic PCa (3.5-fold), even though
germline mutations in this gene have only been observed
in 0.44% of PCa cases [150]. Germline BRCA mutations
confer a particularly aggressive phenotype to PCa with
a higher probability of nodal involvement and distant
metastases [151]. ATM mutations and deletions were
7228

Oncotarget

found to occur in 8% of PCa [149].
As mentioned above, the DNA damage repair
(DDR) protein PARP-1 is essential for the activity of
TMPRSS2-EGR in PCa [28], but also plays a major role
in AR transcriptional program [152]. PARP-1 is recruited
to the sites of AR targets and promotes further binding
of AR; pharmacological inhibition of PARP inhibits PCa
growth in vitro and in vivo.
Prostate tumors with mutated or deleted BRCA
genes and ATM are candidates for treatment with PARP
inhibitors in clinical trials. Several trials are ongoing, and
at least two are testing PARP inhibitors in selected cancers
(including PCa) with mutations in BRCA genes (phase I
NCT00892736 with veliparib) and phase II NCT01078662
with olaparib.
AR and DNA damage repair crosstalk.
Importantly, results from large clinical trials showed
strong augmentation of efficacy of radiotherapy (RT)
for aggressive PCa when combined with anti-androgen
therapy, suggesting a potential role for AR inhibition
in dampening DDR. Two recent independent studies
elucidated the role of AR signaling in enhancing DDR.
AR promotes expression and activity of key DDR factors
such as DNAPK, XRCC2, and XRCC3, whereas DNAPK
in turn supports the AR transcriptional program [153].
Androgen deprivation induces a decrease in transcription
of key DNA damage repair genes and leads to higher levels
and slow repair of DNA damage after radiation therapy,
in particular non-homologous end-joining [154]. This
could have an implication for the ADT effects in creating
genomic instability prior to onset of castrate-resistant
disease, or even contributing to development of CRPC

via repression of DDR. Even in absence of DD inducing
treatment, the androgen-deprived cells have a higher levels
of double-strand breaks [154]. This strongly suggests that
increased AR signaling promotes radioresistance.
MYB protein was found to supplant the role of
AR in regulating DDR by regulating an overlapping set
of genes. Knockdown of MYB or some of its targets
(TOPB1, ATR, CHK1) in CRPC increased the cytotoxicity
of PARP inhibitor indicating that co-targeting MYB
pathway and PARP activity could be a potential treatment
strategy [155].
Developmental pathways and genes in CRPC
Development of prostate is entirely dependent on
endocrine and paracrine AR signaling, whereby expression
of AR in UGS (urogenital sinus) mesenchyme orchestrates
outgrowth and branching of prostatic epithelium, and the
subsequent expression of AR in the epithelium is required
for the production of prostatic secretion. It is now clear
that developmental pathways activated by mesenchymal
AR signaling and involved in the epithelial–mesenchymal
interactions during prostate development could be
inappropriately reactivated during tumorigenesis. These
pathways are numerous (reviewed in [156], and it appears
that all have been implicated in PCa, either as drivers of
oncogenic transformation or, more consistently, drivers
of transition to castration resistance as well as EMT
(epithelial-mesenchymal transition). Indeed, deregulation
of developmental pathways is usually associated with the
CRPC and less so with localized tumors. The intriguing
aspect of the developmental pathways deregulated in PCa
is that many of them are normally active during prostate

morphogenesis and branching in basal cells that are
currently thought to be stem cells for all three lineages
found in prostate gland.
Prostate development from UGS involves
cooperation of multiple developmental pathways and gene
products including but not limited to AR, SHH, FGF10,
WNT, TGFβ, NKX3.1, SOX9, FOXA1 and others. Most
of these appear to be involved in the development and/or
progression of prostate cancer, and most interact with AR
signaling (Figure 2).
NKX3.1, an androgen-regulated homeobox protein
[157] is a marker of prostate stem cells; it exhibits
frequent copy losses in PCa, much more frequent in CRPC
versus localized disease [158]. Reduced expression of
NKX3.1 might be a result of epigenetic silencing as well.
NKX3.1 expression is rapidly suppressed during androgen
withdrawal, a fact most likely related to the progression of
the castrate resistant state.
Loss of NKX3.1 is thought to be an initiating
event in prostate carcinogenesis [159]. It is mutated in
one form of hereditary prostate cancer [160]. NKX3.1
and AR directly regulate each other in a regulatory loop,
and, together with FOXA1 are important players in PCa
progression [161]. NKXS.1 loss cooperates with PTEN
loss, and Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice develop aggressive
androgen independent PCa in GEMM [35]. Interestingly,
loss of PTEN causes reduced expression of NKX3.1in
PCa, and functional data show that restored normal
expression of NKX3.1 counteracts pro-survival and proproliferation effects of PTEN loos [162]. The other effects
of NKX3.1 expression include increased p53 acetylation
(through HDAC1) and half-life [162]. NKX3-1 copy
loss is associated with an increase in genomic instability
[163] and activation of MYC transcriptional program
[164]. Copy loss of NKX3.1 is a strong biomarker of
poor prognosis after prostatectomy or radiotherapy. When
combined with MYC gain, the prognostic significance of
both for biochemical relapse is even higher [163].
SOX9, similar to NKX3.1 is the early marker
and an essential gene in ductal morphogenesis in
prostate development [165]. In adult normal prostate
its expression is found only in basal cells that are AR
negative or low [166], but in PCa cells SOX9 and AR
are frequently co-expressed, and SOX9 might contribute
to AR regulation [166]. The oncogenic ERG expressed
from the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in PCA was shown to
upregulate transcription of SOX9 in PCa by redirecting
AR to a cryptic androgen-responsive enhancer in SOX9
regulatory region [6]. SOX9 cooperates in development
of HG-PIN with PTEN heterozygous loss in a GEMM
[167]. Deletion of Sox9 in two GEMMs of prostate
tumorigenesis prevents cancer development indicating
an essential role for Sox9 in PCa. [168]. Its expression is
associated with higher Gleason scores and with aggressive
PCa and CRPC where SOX9 activity is probably co-opted
to increase growth and proliferation [167]. SOX9 might
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

be also involved in the development of highly aggressive
neuroendocrine phenotype [169].
A transcription factor ZBTB7A or LRF was
implicated in regulating SOX9. ZBTB7A was
unexpectedly shown to act as a tumor suppressor in
prostate cancer, even though it was thought to be a protooncogene in other cancers [170]. ZBTB7A binds to SOX9
and antagonizes its function, and its expression is absent or
low in a subset of aggressive PCa [170]. Moreover, loss of
ZBTB7A cooperates with the loss of PTEN to contribute
to development of CRPC phenotype in GEMM [144].
WNT pathway. β-catenin (CTNNB1) is mutated in
5% of prostate cancers [171], and mutations presumably
stabilize the protein. It is essential for the identity
specification in normal prostate development, but is
dispensable in adult prostate maintenance [172, 173].
However, activation of β-Catenin in the adult prostate
resulted in high grade PIN (HGPIN) and continuous
prostatic growth after castration [174]. β-catenin is
dispensable for tumor progression in the PTEN null
model, but if overexpressed in this model it drives
invasive growth [172]. β-catenin can directly stimulate
activity of AR [175] through binding to it [176] and
controls the number of progenitors in the epithelial buds
and regulates a network that includes c-Myc and Nkx3.1.
A small-molecule inhibitor of nuclear β-catenin activity
can inhibit both the AR and β-catenin–signaling pathways
in prostate cancer, and induce decreased binding of AR to
its target genes sequences, as well as inhibit PCa growth
in vivo [177]. Several other members of WNT pathway
are mutated or have CNVs in CRPC. In particular, copy
number losses or hypermethylation of APC, and loss of
BMP7 were described [60]. The latter, a bone stroma
secreted protein, suppresses bone metastases [178] and
induces senescence in PCa CSCs via activation of BMP7BMPR2-p38-NDRG1 [179]. Two agents with modulatory
or inhibitory activity in WNT pathway are in early clinical
testing (NCT02020291, NCT01608867; see Table 2).
Hedgehog pathway is an essential pathway in
normal prostate embryogenesis [180]. Sonic hedgehog
(shh) deficiency induces defects in prostate development
that are due to impaired production of androgens [181].
GLI transcription factors are the main effectors of the
canonical HH pathway and play an oncogenic role in a
variety of cancers. The role of Hh pathway in PCa is still
somewhat controversial, in part because of the widespread
use of non-specific pathway inhibitors, but current results
support the role of paracrine interactions versus autocrine
Hh signaling in PCa [182]. Several studies have detected
elevated expression of Shh and Gli2 in malignant prostate
epithelium that correlated with the grade of malignancies
[183, 184]. Analysis of the intermediate risk group or PCa
indicated that genetic alterations in Hh pathway were
associated with worse prognosis [185], and implicated
serine protease inhibitor nexin 1 (PN1) as a negative
regulator of Hh signaling in prostate.
7230

Oncotarget

The role of Hh signaling in PCa is most likely
associated with its ability to modulate activity of AR [183,
186]. Hh signaling was shown to be induced in murine and
human PCa following castration and to contribute to CR
phenotype after ADT [187]. Hh/Gli axis supports androgen
signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent
prostate cancer cells likely through a direct interaction of
Gli2 with AR [188, 189]. It was suggested that Shh-Gli1
axis might govern transition form androgen-dependent to
androgen independent state and even supersede the AR
pathway [190]. This evidence strongly supports the role of
Hh signaling in the development of castration resistance.
Hh and Notch pathways are involved in the
development of resistance to docetaxel which is associated
with elevated signaling and increased expression of Gli1
and Gli2 [191]. Cells with a shift to a more basal phenotype
and markers of elevated Hh and Notch signaling are found
in PCa biopsies and are particularly enriched in biopsies
from patients who developed resistance to docetaxel
based therapy. The tumors formed in a xenograft model
by cells selected in vitro for resistance to docetaxel are
sensitive to the dual inhibition of Hh and Notch pathway
by cyclopamine (inhibitor of Smo) and DBZ (inhibitor of
γ-secretase).
As described above, stabilization of GLI factors is
one of the probable effects of SPOP mutations in PCa since
SPOP participates in a pathway leading to the degradation
of Gli [57]. Activated TGF-β/SMAD and WNT signal
transduction pathway in CRPC also contribute to increased
expression of Gli2, whereby SMAD3 in cooperation with
β-catenin transcriptionally activates Gli2 [192].
Therapeutic implications. The SMO-targeting
agents GDC-0449 and LDE225 are in Phase I/II
NCT01163084 trial and entering phase I NCT02111187,
respectively, for locally advanced PCA; the non-specific
Hedgehog pathway inhibitor itraconazole is in phase
II trial NCT01787331 for patients with biochemical
relapse and in combination with orteronel in phase I/II
NCT02054793 for CRPC.
TGF-β pathway and SMAD4. The role of TGF-β
pathway in PCa, similar to other cancers, is complex.
TGF-β is known to play a dual role in tumorigenesis,
acting as a growth inhibitory tumor suppressor early in
the process, and as a tumor promoter in late-stage disease.
In a GEMM model of prostate tumorigenesis PTEN
inactivation drives formation of indolent tumors and
elicits the activation of TGF-β/BMP-SMAD4 signaling.
The latter induces cellular senescence to curb tumor
progression, and genetic deletion of SMAD4 (key effector
in TGF-β pathway) leads to the development of highly
invasive and metastatic tumors with 100% penetrance
[41]. This study also verified the predictive significance
of the expression signature including PTEN and SMAD4
as well as CCND1 and SPP1 (osteopontin) in a large
number of PCa biopsies. Loss of expression of SMAD4 is
observed earlier in PCa with high Gleason grade SMAD4,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therefore, serves to inhibit PCa progression at least in
early stages of tumorigenesis.
The TGF-β/SMAD4 dependent barrier to tumor
progression is destructed in metastatic PCa through
involvement of transcription factor COUP-TFII/NR2F2.
COUP-TFII exerts its effects on TGF-β pathway by
directly interacting with and inhibiting SMAD4, therefore
cooperating with PTEN loss in GEMM [193]. COUP-TFII
blocks the tumor-inhibiting effects of TGF-β in tumor
progression to aggressive stage. Importantly, COUP-TFII
is overexpressed in about 60% of prostate cancer and
predicts a worsened survival [193].
In contrast to its barrier role during cancer initiation,
TGFβ promotes metastatic phenotype in late stages by
driving epithelial mesenchymal transition. TGFβ and
TGFβR are expressed at higher levels in metastatic PCa,
and are instrumental in EMT that is mediated, in part, by
upregulation of the molecular chaperone clusterin via
EMT transcription factor TWIST1 [194]. While SMAD3
contributes to activation of AR transcriptional activity,
SMAD4, together with SMAD3 can also interact with AR
and repress AR mediated transcription [195].
Radiation therapy frequently employed for treatment
of PCa can increase levels of serum TGFβ and promote
distant metastasis. Clinical trial NCT01427322 aims to
examine if the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib given prior
to palliative irradiation for bone metastases could lower
the levels of TGFβ.
Notch pathway. Notch signaling was shown to
be critical for normal prostate development [196] using
a conditional Notch1 gene deletion mutant. Deletion of
Notch lead to enhanced epithelial proliferation in prostate,
and expression of Notch1 and its effector Hey-1 gene in
human prostate adenocarcinomas is significantly downregulated compared to normal control tissue [196]. At the
same time, increased Notch and Hh signaling are involved
in development of resistance to Docetaxel [191]. Notch
signaling also may play a pro-metastatic role by inhibiting
anoikis in luminal cells [197].
Polycomb group protein EZH2. Enhancer of zeste
homolog 2 is a methyltransferase and a component of
repressive PRC2 complex that triggers transcriptional
repression by catalyzing the addition of methyl groups
onto lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me2/3). EZH2 is
not expressed in normal adult prostate, but is highly
expressed in UGS during development and then again at
puberty in prostatic epithelium [198]. EZH2 expression
is high in almost all metastatic CRPC, and its expression
in localized PCa is associated with poor prognosis
[199]. Expression of EZH2 is negatively regulated by
microRNAs miR26-a [200] and miR101 [201], of which
the former is hypermethylated in ETS fusion negative PCa
[67], while the latter is deleted in both localized (37%)
and metastatic (67%) PCa [201]. High levels of MYC in
PCa also drive expression of EZH2 by downregulating
miR26-a [69]. One of the targets of EZH2 is the prostate
7231

Oncotarget

tumor suppressor NKX3.1 [7] as well as other Homeobox
genes promoters [67].
EZH2 could impede epithelial differentiation and
contribute to prostate cancer progression because it was
shown to directly modulate the transcriptional output of
AR [202]. Moreover, EZH2, independent of its function
as PRC2 component, was very recently found to act as
a transcriptional activator in the deregulated AR program
in PCa. Overexpression of EZH2 conferred androgen
independent growth. In this setting, EZH2, together with
AR, stimulated transcription from a number of genes
essential for growth in androgen depleted conditions.
The switch of function from repressor to co-activator
was mediated through phosphorylation of EZH2 by AKT
[203].
Therapeutic implications. Inhibitors of EZH2
GSK126 and EPZ-6438 are in clinical trials for DLCBL
and FL where EZH2 is frequently mutated on Y641 and
A677. Another inhibitor, 3-deazaneplanocin A, has been
reported to have activity in vitro against PCa cells [204].
Polycomb group protein BMI1 is a member of
repressive and most likely oncogenic PRC1 complex
acting in epigenetic silencing of gene expression. PRC1L
monoubiquitinates nucleosomal histone H2A at lysine
119 [205]. It stimulates the ubiquitin ligase activity
towards H2A-K119, and is thought to exert its main role
of a regulator of stem cell renewal and an oncogene in
part through repression of transcription form CDKN2A
locus and genes that induce senescence and cell death
[206, 207]. Silencing of CDKN2A locus by BMI1 and
the PRC1 complex depends on continuous presence of
EZH2 [208]. Several microRNAs that are repressed by
EZH2 have been shown to regulate the expression of
PRC1 proteins including BMI1, indicating a coordinate
regulation of PRC1 and PRC2 activities by miRNAs
[209]. Bmi-1 expression is required for maintenance and
self-renewal activity of prostate and PCa p63(+) stem cells
and is necessary for β-catenin induced self renewal. Bmi1 inhibition protects prostate cells from FGF10-driven
hyperplasia and slows the growth of aggressive cancers
with PTEN deletion [210]. Its elevated expression in PCa
correlates with poor prognosis [211, 212]. Conditional
overexpression of Bmi1 in mice induces PIN and
promotes progression to invasive adenocarcinoma on
the background of PTEN haploinsufficiency. Moreover,
Akt phosphorylates and activates Bmi1 and promotes its
oncogenic potential [213].
BMI1 is induced by IKKa via transcription factor
E2F1 in regenerating prostate and in PCA after ADT. This
is a cell-autonomous process triggered by infiltrating B
cells, and links CRPC development to inflammation [214].
The regenerative response is ultimately controlled by
BMI1 expression within normal or cancer progenitor cells.
HOXB13 is a homeobox transcription factor that
plays a critical role in prostate development. A variant
HOXB133 G84E was found to be closely associated with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the risk of prostate cancer [215]. Hoxb-13 interacts with
AR, and is required for full-activation of some androgenregulated target genes [216]. Binding of HOXB13 to
AR inhibits activation of genes containing androgen
responsive promoter elements and activates transcription
of genes containing HOXB13 response sequences [216].
FGFR pathway is intimately involved in the
prostate development from urogenital sinus [217]
through activation of ERK1/2, which is essential for the
androgen induced morphogenesis. FGFR2 was shown to
be an essential receptor in prostate morphogenesis, whose
interaction with FGF10 and FGF7 control branching in
developing prostate gland [218]. FGF10 functions as a
mesenchymal paracrine regulator of epithelial growth in
the prostate and seminal vesicle [219]. Stromal derived
FGF10 stimulates growth of prostatic epithelium, and
its own expression is stimulated by androgens [220].
Enhanced mesenchymal expression of FGF10 promoted
formation of PIN or PCa, while inhibition of FGFR1 in
epithelial compartment inhibited tumor formation [221].
Inducible expression of FGFR1 in prostate epithelium led
to formation of tumors that showed characteristics of EMT
and had increased expression of SOX9 and Wnt pathway
receptor frizzled 4 (Fzd4), both of which are expressed at
high levels in human metastatic prostate cancer [221]. In
the TRAMP mouse model of PCa, mice null for FGFR1
expression in prostate cells developed smaller tumors and,
more importantly, had very few metastases, while those
metastases that developed had re-acquired high levels of
FGFR1 and had a neuroendocrine phenotype [222].
Therapeutic implications. Inhibitors of FGFR
signaling are in clinical trials. In particular, as FGFR was
implicated in EMT and osteoblastic progression of PCa, a
small molecule multikinase inhibitor dovitinib (TKI258)
is explored in phase II trial for bone metastatic CRPC
NCT00831792. Another inhibitor, nintedanib (BIBF1120)
completed phase II trial NCT00706628, but results have
not been reported.
FOXA1 is a transcription factor with a well-known
essential role in prostate morphogenesis [223]. It appears
to play a unique role in regulation of many nuclear steroid
receptors [224], and serves as a co-factor for AR as well.
Expression of FOXA1 is high in metastatic PCa [225]
and is altered by copy number gain in 5% of CRPC [60].
Its role in signaling by AR is complex, as modulation of
FOXA1 levels in vitro results in massive redistribution
of AR binding sites, with some being highly enriched
for AR binding, while other depleted of AR [226]. The
FOXA1 deregulation leads to increased proliferation in the
castrate resistant prostate cancer [227]. The precise role
of FOXA1 in transcriptional transactivation by AR might
have to be reconsidered in view of recent results showing
that the binding sites for AR and FOXA1 identified in
cell lines in vitro are quite different from those identified
in vivo, with AR-FOXA1 binding diminished and ARSTAT5 binding increased [228]. FOXA1 function in
7232

Oncotarget

promoting cell growth is AR dependent, but FOXA1 has
actually an inhibitory effect on cell invasion, which is ARindependent [229]. Mutations in FOXA1 described in PCa
attenuate the inhibitory effect of FOXA1 on cell motility
[229].

a stem cell de-differentiated phenotype and promoting
tumor progression [237]. Transcriptional program of
AR in PCa cells involves acetyltransferase p300 that is
required at an early stage of chromatin remodeling and
transcription complex assembly after binding of androgen
receptor [238].
EZH2 and BMI1, already described above, are prime
examples of how components of chromatin remodeling
complexes are involved both in development of prostate
and in PCa. CHD1, frequently inactivated in PCa [33, 61],
is also global chromatin remodeling factor. In addition
to CHD1, other components of the MLL (mixed-lineage
leukemia) complex are affected by mutations or CNV in
CRPC. In particular, MLL2 and ASH2L directly interact
with AR, and mutations are found in MLL2 (9% of
CRPC), ASH2L, UTX, and ASXL1 [60].
The chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF plays
a tumor suppressor role in PCa which is antagonized by
a long noncoding RNA SChLAP1 [239]. In particular,
SChLAP1 reduces chromatin binding of SNF5, a key
subunit of the complex, and deregulates transcription of
SNF5 target genes. SChLAP1 is overexpressed in about
25% of PCa and is a strong predictor of recurrence and
mortality [239].

Epigenetic pathways in PCa
Epigenetics encompasses several processes, such
as DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA
interference. All of these are altered in PCa initiation
and more so during progression, and play a functional
role in prostate carcinogenesis. The role of epigenetic
deregulation is PCa and particularly CRPC is strongly
supported by a number of somatogenic alterations in
multiple genes whose products are involved in DNA
or histone modifications. These alterations result in
whole-scale changes in DNA methylation and histone
acetylation. Historically, hypermethylation of DNA
has been long known to occur in PCa, with GSTP1
discovered as one of the prominent targets [230]. Regions
that are frequently hypermethylated across individual
tumors tend to be markedly enriched for cancer- and
development/differentiation-related genes including
tumor suppressors [231]. Aberrant methylation has been
shown to be associated already with benign prostate
hyperplasia and specific changes are found during PCa
progression (reviewed in [232]. Methylation of CG
islands was shown to increase with disease progression
from benign hyperplasia to CRPC [233]. Importantly,
detection of methylation could be used in diagnostic
and prognostic procedures. Recent evidence suggests
that hypermethylation of some genes including GSTP1
may be not causative in gene repression but rather be a
consequence of differentiation and hyperproliferation of
cancer cells ([234].
Intercommunication of paracrine signaling and
epigenetic alterations was demonstrated in a number of
studies, where targeted inactivation of TGFβ receptor
[235] or overexpression of FGF [221] in mesenchymal
compartment lead to development of PIN. Overexpression
of chromatin remodeling protein Hmg2a in stromal
cells was sufficient to induce dramatic hyperplasia
and multifocal prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in the
adjacent naïve epithelial cells [236]. This striking effect
was mediated by paracrine Wnt-dependent signaling, and
was further promoted towards frank prostate cancer by
enhanced expression of AR in stroma.
Activation of AR transcriptional program in CRPC
apparently involves numerous chromatin remodeling
events. For example, genomic studies have recently
revealed that AR might act as a global transcriptional
repressor. In embryonic stem cells, androgen-responsive
elements (ARE) in AR-repressed genes are occupied by
repressive Polycomb group protein EZH2 that maintains
the undifferentiated state. These genes are also silenced
in castration-resistant prostate cancer conferring to them
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell cycle regulation/tumor suppressors/oncogenes and
other
Inactivation of tumor suppressors TP53 and
RB1 is much more common in CRPC than in localized
cancers [240-242]. Loss of RB1 function through various
mechanisms was observed in PCa, and is associated with
late stages and particularly CRPC [243, 244]. RB1 might
control androgen signaling and progression to castrateresistant phenotype [245, 246]. CDKN1B (p27KIP) is also
deleted or mutated in PCa [51].
A recent study suggests that metastasis suppressor
p63 inhibits EMT and metastases at least in part via
regulation of miR-205. Either or both p63 and miR-205
are absent in lymph nodes or distant metastases of PCa
patients [247].
MYC amplification is very common in CRPC, found
in at least a third of these tumors. As mentioned earlier,
MYC is overexpressed already in PIN but amplifications
are mostly limited to CRPC [78]. C-Myc and Pim1
activation in GEMM induces neuroendocrine type of PC
[248]. KRAS, ROS1, and MET mutations, though rare, are
found at higher rate in mCRPC than in primary cancers;
CDK4 is more frequently amplified in mCRPC.
RAF. Rearrangements of RAF oncogenes (SLC45A3-BRAF, ESRP1-RAF1) are found in 1-2% of PCa, mostly
CRPC [249]. These rare tumors are of clinical interest
because they could be potentially targeted with inhibitors
of RAF, BRAF and MEK.
UBE2C is overexpressed in many tumors, including
CRPC [250]. UBE2C is an anaphase-promoting complex/
cyclosome (APC/C)-specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
7233

Oncotarget

enzyme, and upregulation of UBE2C inactivates the
M phase cell cycle checkpoint [251]. Activation of
UBE2C expression involves binding of the PI3K/AKT
phosphorylated co-activator MED1 to the long range
UBE2C enhancers, and chromatin looping through
recruitment of FoxA1 [252]. Expression of UBE2C is
driven by androgen receptor [85]. Epigenetic marks at
the UBE2C enhancer, notably histone H3K4 methylation
and FoxA1 binding are present in androgen-independent
cells, and they direct AR-enhancer binding and UBE2C
activation [85]. Increased expression of two constitutively
active AR splice variants driven by treatment with
abiraterone or enzalutamide was accompanied by
increased expression of UBE2C, and expression of these
variant but not full length AR positively correlated with
UBE2C in clinical CRPC specimens [97]. Therefore,
expression of UBE2C could contribute to drug resistance
to CRPC therapy.
Estrogen receptor β. Estrogens were originally
used to treat PCa to reduce the hypothalamic pituitary
stimulation of LH/FSH production and further reduce
the synthesis of androgens in 1942, reprinted in [253].
However, stimulation of ERβ has a number of serious
clinical consequences and the use of estrogens was
eventually replaced by other methods of achieving
chemical castration, even though recently there has been a
renewed interest in their use for PCa. Expression of ERβ
in prostate was described in 1996 [254], and in PCa it
correlates inversely with the Gleason grade [255]. ERβ,
as opposed to ERα, is thought to have anti-proliferative,
pro-apoptotic and anti-metastatic properties in cancer in
general and PCa in particular, and could be an actionable
therapeutic target in PCa (reviewed in [256, 257]).
Several selective ERβ agonists have been discovered
or synthesized (reviewed in [258]), including some of
botanical origin, or phytoestrogens [259].
ERβ agonist induces apoptosis in prostatic stromal,
luminal and castrate-resistant basal epithelial cells in BPH
of estrogen-deficient aromatase knock-out mice, as well as
in xenografts of prostate cancer. ERβ is downregulated in
high grade PCa via TGFβ and hypoxia, and loss of ERβ is
sufficient to promote EMT in PCa. ERβ expression induces
destabilization of HIF-1α and transcriptional repression of
VEGF-A [260]. The mechanism of the destabilization of
HIF-1α involves direct transcriptional activation of prolyl
hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) by ER. PHD2 is a 2-oxoglutaratedependent dioxygenase that hydroxylates HIF-1α and
targets it for recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor
suppressor and consequent degradation. PHD2 is activated
by ERβ in a ligand-dependent manner and contributes to
maintenance of the epithelial differentiation [261].
ERβ agonist treatment attenuates clonogenicity
and self-renewal of murine prostatic progenitor cells and
depletes both murine and human prostatic basal cells.
Subsequent to castration ERβ induces further apoptosis in
basal, luminal and intermediate cells [262].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ERβ ligands are not currently in clinical
development for PCa, either as monotherapy or in
combination with ADT.

Prostate cancer stem cells
Much controversy existed and some still exists in
the field concerning the nature of prostate and PCa stem
cells. The prostate gland contains epithelial luminal cells
with high levels of expression of AR, basal cells with low
or absent AR and rare neuroendocrine cells. There is an
agreement regarding the origin of prostate stem cells,
which have been amply demonstrated to reside in the
basal multipotent population [263-266]. A subpopulation
of basal cells expressing high levels of TROP2 was
shown to be able to form spheres in vitro and give rise
in vivo to basal, luminal and neuroendocrine cells thus
exhibiting multipotency [267]. However, androgeninduced regeneration after castration is mediated by both
basal and luminal progenitors rather than by multipotent
stem cells [268, 269]. Thus, basal cells were traced to give
rise only to basal cells during prostate regeneration in vivo,
and luminal cells produce only luminal cells under these
circumstances, with both lineages self-sustained in the
normal adult prostate [268].
Lineage-tracing approaches have identified rare
luminal cells, named castration-resistant Nkx3-1expressing cells, or CARNs, as also possessing multipotent
stem cell activity [269]. However, the stemness of rare
luminal cells in normal prostate was not confirmed in other
studies [268, 270].
In terms of PCa initiation, evidence exists that
supports involvement of both lineages. Prostate luminal
cells, transit-amplifying cells (that have characteristics of
both basal and luminal cells), and basal cells have all been
implicated as the cells of origin for prostate cancer. Basal
cells with introduced relevant mutations demonstrated
ability to form PCa thus supporting their initiating role
in PCa. The tumor-initiating ability was found to reside
in basal cells CD49fhiTrop2hi expressing p63 [263, 271].
At the same time, the rare luminal cells, CARN,
could also give rise to PCa on a PTEN null background
[269]. In lineage tracing during PCa initiation on PTEN
null background, it was found that in basal cells PTEN
induces differentiation into luminal cells, and this has
been shown to be an essential step for disease initiation
in this model [268]. Disrupting the tumor suppressor Pten
in luminal cells also led to prostate cancer initiation, with
a faster dynamic compared to basal cells populations. A
recent publication described a bipotential basal progenitor
that can give rise to luminal cells with transit-amplifying
characteristics [272]. The oncogenic transformation
of basal cells promoted luminal differentiation of their
progeny. This study also proposed that prostate tumors
arising from luminal cells based on gene expression
signature are more aggressive and have a worse prognosis

[272]. Yet another study delineated different contributions
of basal versus luminal cells to initiation versus
maintenance and progression of PCA. It concluded that
while basal cells are the initiating cells in PCA, “advanced
prostate adenocarcinoma initiated in basal cells can be
maintained by luminal-like tumor-propagating cells”
[273].
The cancer stem cells (CSC) of basal or liminal
origin are very likely a source of treatment-resistant cells.
The studies mentioned above described castration-resistant
cells in both CSC populations. The prostate CSC do not
express androgen receptor, or have very low levels of it,
and therefore survive the androgen deprivation serving as a
reservoir of treatment-resistant cells [274]. These putative
androgen receptor negative cancer stem cells are likely to
be resistant to most androgen-based therapies, contributing
to the evolution of castration-resistant disease.
To support this notion, a cell population
characterized by low levels of PSA (PSA(-/lo)) was
identified as being quiescent, refractory to androgen
deprivation, having high clonogenic potential and longterm tumor-propagating capacity. These express stem
cell genes and can undergo asymmetric cell division to
generate PSA(+) cells. PSA(-/lo) PCa cells resist androgen
ablation in castrated hosts, and they harbor highly
tumorigenic castration-resistant PCa cells. PSA(-/lo) cells
may represent a critical source of castration-resistant PCa
cells [275].
Apparently, some phenotypic markers of PCa stem
cells might have a functional significance in development
of PCa. Trop2hi has been shown to play a significant
role in stem cell renewal and epithelial hyperplasia via
β-catenin pathway. Trop2 undergoes intramembrane
proteolysis to release two polypeptides, of which the
intracellular one translocates to the nucleus. High
expression of the Trop2 intracellular domain promotes
self-renewal through signaling via β-catenin and is
sufficient to initiate precursor lesions to prostate cancer
in vivo [273].
The role of the Polycomb group protein BMI in
regeneration of normal prostate progenitor cells and
in PCSC was described above. A recent publication
elucidated a signaling axis involved in both normal
prostate regeneration and in emergence of CRPC after
ADT that consists of IKKa-E2F1-BMI1. Nuclear IKKa
controls CRPC development through expansion of BMI1+
progenitors. The most intriguing aspect of these findings
is that expression of BMI1 is triggered by inflammation
that depends on the infiltration of B cells into regenerating
prostate rudiments, either normal or cancerous, after ADT.
The BMI1 controlled tumor growth is therefore at least
partially cell-autonomous [214].
Integrin β4 was shown recently to promote self
renewal of putative cancer stem cells that are basal in
origin. β4 promotes adhesion of the cells to the basal
membrane, which apparently is necessary for the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

maintenance of stemness. More importantly, mutation of
β4 prevents tumor formation on PTEN null background.
Finally, the high level of expression of integrin β4 in
prostate cancers was associated with androgen independent
metastases to bone. Finally, integrin β4 is associated with
activation of Erbb2 and Met receptor tyrosine kinases,
and pharmacological inhibition of these results in efficient
inhibition of tumor growth in mice [276]. This indicates
that combination of lapatinib and cabozantinib could have
promise in treatment of PCa.
Recently, a report was published that described
establishment of a xenograft model capable of supporting
growth of stroma-supported xenografts from multiple
patients with early stage disease [277]. More importantly,
the model allows to follow the fate of tumor cells that
survive after castration, therefore it might be used for
the identification of castrate resistant PCa cells that are
responsible for the emergence of CRPC [277].

Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT)
EMT endows cells with migratory and invasive
properties, induces stem cell properties, and prevents
apoptosis and senescence, thus orchestrating the initiation
of metastasis. EMT is characterized by the loss of
expression of E-cadherin and induction of N-cadherin,
loss of cell polarity and dependence on adhesion, all
contributing to metastatic phenotype. Numerous pathways
have been implicated in EMT in PCa, including some
developmental pathways, inflammation driven signaling,
ERG fusions and others, some of which are listed below.
Androgen deprivation induces expression of
N-cadherin and EMT [278] in vitro and in patients. This
transition was observed in normal prostate upon ADT
and in PCa patients treated with ADT, and involves
transcription factor ZEB1 [279]. In addition, upregulation
of ZEB proteins is induced by several growth factors such
as IGF-1 [280] and PDGF-β [281] that promote EMT in
vitro.
EZH2 can induce EMT and increase the metastatic
potential of prostate cancer cells by downregulation of
DAB2IP, a tumor-suppressive Ras GTPase-activating
protein (RasGAP) [282, 283]. EZH2 is, in turn, regulated
by SOX4 [284], a homeobox transcription factor that
was shown to act as an oncogene in PCa based on its
overexpression and essential role in survival of PCA in
vitro [285]. SOX4 appears to be a master regulator of
EMT primarily through upregulating EZH2 expression in
breast cancer [284].
TMPRSS2/ERG was also shown to promote EMT
via direct transcriptional activation of expression of
ZEB1, and indirect activation of ZEB2 through IL1R2
and SPINT1 [286]. In addition, ERG induces loss of cell
adhesion by activating the WNT pathways through FZD4
to induce EMT and loss of cell adhesion [287].
TGF-β represents a potent EMT inducer in normal

To achieve a more complete
inhibition of AR signaling via Phase 2
inhibition of both CYP17 and AR

development and tumor progression via Smad-dependent
and independent transcriptional pathways [288]. Smadmediated induction of Snail, Slug, and Twist via high
motility group A2 (HMGA2) and Smad-independent
phosphorylation of Par6 contribute to dissolution of cell
junction complexes. TGF-β also induces expression of
clusterin, a pleotropic chaperone protein [289] through
activation of TWIST1 [194], a known inducer of EMT.
Interestingly, another chaperone protein HSP90, in its
secreted form, was shown to be involved in EMT of PCa
cells in vitro and in patients [290]. TWIST1 is upregulated
by enzalutamide treatment along with activation of PKC,
and both could be reversed by addition of PKC inhibitor
Ro31-8220, at least in vitro [291], suggesting a potential
approach to overcoming EMT associated with androgen
deprivation.
Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondriabound enzyme, was recently implicated in EMT in
PCa. MAOA catalyzes the degradation of monoamine
neurotransmitters and dietary amines producing peroxide
as a by-product and increasing levels of cellular ROS.
Expression of MAOA is associated with high grade
PCa [292], and causes activation of VEGF and its coreceptor neuropilin-1 which in turn, promotes AKT/
FOXO1/TWIST1 signaling and EMT. Monoamine
oxidase inhibitors were the first antidepressant drugs
in use, and one of them, chlorgylin, a selective MAOA
inhibitor, blocked PCa growth in vitro and metastasis in
vivo by disrupting the signaling leading to oxidative stress,
hypoxia and EMT [293].
Expression of inducible FGFR1 in a mouse model
induces PCa with EMT characteristics and involves
activation of SOX9 transcriptional activity and activation
of WNT pathway protein Fzd4; this was validated in
human PCa [294].
β2-microglobulin is a pleiotropic signaling
molecule that is highly expressed in bone metastases
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in PCa. β2-M interacts, among many other proteins,
with hemochromatosis protein HFE, modulating iron
homeostasis and leading to activation of HIF-1 (hypoxiainducible factor-1) signaling pathways [295]. HIF1
activates the expression of number of genes including
VEGF that have been linked to EMT transition in vitro
[296]. Estrogen receptor β inhibits EMT in PCa cells
by destabilizing HIF-1α and inhibiting VEGF-mediated
nuclear localization of SNAIL [260].
Paracrine interactions are also contributing to EMT
in PCa. One mechanism involves tumor secreted IL-6
that elicits secretion of metalloproteases by stroma [297].
Cancer associated fibroblasts develop an inflammatory
signature characterized by activation of COX-2/NF-κB
/HIF-1, which induces generation of reactive oxygen
species and the EMT program in prostate cancer cells
[298].
Another example of the role that paracrine
interactions play in EMT and metastasis of PCa involves
tumor secreted cytokine CXCL16 and its receptor CXCR6
expressed on bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem
cells (MSC). CXCR6 induced signaling on MSC promotes
their recruitment into PCa tumors, conversion into cancer
– associate fibroblasts (CAF) and secretion of CXCL12/
stroma derived factor 1. In turn, CXCL12 stimulates PCa
cells expressing the CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4, which
facilitates EMT, migration and metastasis [299].
EMT might play a critical role in the metastatic
behavior of PCa, in particular bone metastases that present
a very serious clinical challenge. Some investigational
agents that might show efficacy in the spread of bone
metastases are listed in Table 3, and they include
cabozantinib, an inhibitor of MET, an RTK with a well
know role in EMT. Cabozantinib shows anti-metastatic
activity in mouse models of bone metastases [133] and
significant clinical activity in patients with bone metastatic
cancer [134]. Inhibitors of FGFR signaling (dovitinib) are
7236

also in clinical trials, as described above. In 2013 FDA
approved a monoclonal antibody agent for the treatment of
bone metastasis Denosumab (Xgeva), inhibitor of receptor
activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL)
that was shown to delayed skeletal events. Denosumab
was also shown recently to modestly prolong time to bone
metastases in patients with non-metastatic disease [300],
however the FDA did not approve it for this indication
as there was no an associated survival advantage. Also
in 2013 FDA approved radium-223 chloride (Xofigo)
for the treatment of mCRPC patients whose metastases
are primarily limited to the bones. Radium-223 is an
alpha-emitting alkaline earth metal ion, which, similar
to calcium-ions, accumulates in the bone. Radium-223
therapy modestly extends OS and delays the occurrence
of skeletal complications of prostate cancer.

Data from GEMM implicated the ubiquitin ligase Siah2
which regulates HIF1α degradation in the development
of neuroendocrine phenotype [169]. In particular, HIF1α
and FoxA2-regulated genes Hes6, Sox9 and Jmjd1a are
involved in NE progression and are highly expressed in
metastatic tumors [169]. Hypoxia was also implicated in
development of NE by downregulation of Notch signaling
[309].
Molecular changes strongly associated with NEPC
were identified by NGS of RNA, and most frequent are
overexpression of EZH2 and amplification of Aurora
kinase A and NMYC [310]. Concurrent amplification of
NMYC and AURKA is strongly associated with NEPC
[311], and is also a frequent feature of the neuroendocrine
childhood tumor neuroblastoma. AURKA is necessary for
the growth of MYCN amplified neuroblastoma providing
an essential function in stabilization of NMYC protein
[312].
The neuroendocrine phenotype in PCa was shown
to be mechanistically linked to the downregulation of
transcriptional complex REST [313]. REST is expressed
in neural stem cells and is known as a transcriptional
repressive complex that recruits HDACs, and is essential
for the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype [314,
315] and suppression of neuronal phenotype. In addition
to downregulation of REST, a component of the REST,
PHF21A was found to be differentially spliced in NEPC
to produce a protein lacking DNA binding domain and
therefore rendered inactive in respect to its function [313].
Finally, a recent report describes loss of RB1 as a common
occurrence in CRPC with neuroendocrine features [316].
In addition to classic chemotherapy regimens,
potential novel treatment options for this clinically
aggressive type of PCa could involve Aurora kinase
inhibitors. Clinical trials with inhibitor MLN8237 are
ongoing (NCT01799278) or planned (NCT01848067), in
combination with abiraterone or chemotherapy. A recent
study performed in vitro and in a mouse neuroblastoma
model demonstrated that inhibition of AURKA with
MLN8237 or MLN8054 actually triggers degradation of
NMYC mediated by the Fbxw7 ubiquitin ligase [317].

Neuroendocrine PCa (NEPC)
NEPC is a subtype in a poorly defined group
of prostate cancers that are variously described as
“anaplastic”, “small cells PCa”, or simply “aggressive”
and may represent different histopathological entities.
These are associated with at least one of the following
characteristics: exclusive visceral metastases, or
predominantly lytic bone metastases, bulky tumors, low
prostate-specific antigen, lack of or short response to
androgen deprivation therapy and good but short-lived
responses to platinum-based chemotherapy [301]. Classic
NEPC subtype do not express AR and thus do not respond
to ADT These “aggressive” prostate cancers rarely
arise “de novo”, and most often appear after ADT, at a
frequency of 10 to 20% [301]. An even higher proportion
of CRPC demonstrate a mixed histology with features of
neuroendocrine differentiation [302].
It has been suggested that introduction of the new
ADT agents abiraterone and enzalutamide has significantly
increased the emergence of castrate-resistant cancers with
neuroendocrine features and visceral metastases [303305]. The frequency of NEPC, a resistant form of PCa,
is indeed on the rise, but the reasons for this increase are
under intense discussion and are not yet resolved [306].
It is accepted that development of the aggressive NEPC
phenotype is generally treatment-related, i.e. it is strongly
associated with the development of castrate resistance
[307]. NEPC tumors do not express AR or PSA, and
comprises only about 0.5 to 2% of untreated PCa. NEPC
express neuroendocrine markers, respond poorly to
treatment and metastasize to visceral organs such as liver.
A first-in-class xenograft model established
with xenografts from the fine-needle biopsies showed
that neuroendocrine PCa can evolve directly from
adenocarcinoma via an adaptive response after prolonged
exposure to androgen withdrawal [308]. Possible
molecular changes contributing to NEPC were analyzed
in mouse models and by next generation RNA sequencing.

Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
Search for diagnostic and prognostic tests in
localized PCa. Testing for PSA prostate-specific antigen as
a screening tool for PCa has been useful in diagnosis and
follow-up to treatments in PCa, but it has shortcomings.
These include false positives, unnecessary treatments for
men with low grade PCa but elevated PSA, and occasional
lack of PSA in high grade PCa (particularly with NE
phenotype). Inter-individual variations in PSA levels
have been reported to be associated with three particular
polymorphisms in the individual genomes [318], and this
information might be used for “correction” of PSA scores.
7237

Oncotarget

Detection of TMPRSS2-ERG (T/E) fusion in
urine in combination with serum PSA was reported
to be successful in risk stratification for PCa [319]. A
combination urine test for ERG and PCA3 (a noncoding
RNA associated with PCa) by PCR, and PSA serum
levels, was reported to have a superior diagnostic value
compared to either marker alone [320], in particular in
the active surveillance group of patients [321]. Obviously,
considering that T/E fusion is associated with 40 to 60%
of PCa, these tests will not be useful for T/E negative
patients. These tests, however, have not entered routine
clinical use.
The predictive value of testing is particularly
high in active surveillance, a treatment (or lack of
treatment) approach that has been supported by several
recent clinical trials. They demonstrated better quality
of life for low-risk prostate cancer patients who were
actively monitored rather than treated for their disease.
One such study, the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus
Observation Trial (PIVOT), found that men who have
low-risk cancer may not need early treatment for prostate
cancer [322]. However, the prognostic markers are
badly needed to identify patients who will benefit from
aggressive treatments versus the truly low-risk group.
PCA3, a noncoding RNA overexpressed in PCa [323],
is one of the biomarkers explored, but it could be useful
only in combination with testing for ERG [324, 325].
Both could be detected in urine, which is an important
consideration. A much more extensive test, Prolaris from
Myriad, analyzes an expression signature of 31 cell-cycle
related genes to predict biochemical recurrence, but tumor
biopsies are needed for this analysis. Genomic Health will
be providing the OncotypeDX test soon to help identified
patients in danger of being “overtreated”. Both of these
tests hold promise but their clinical validation is not yet
complete.
A recent study has reported identification of a 19
gene expression signature enriched in genes associated
with aging and senescence, which allows to distinguish
indolent low Gleason tumors. Moreover, expression of just
three genes: FGFR1, PMP22, and CDKN1A accurately
predicted outcome of low Gleason score tumors. Protein
expression of this three-gene panel in biopsy samples
distinguished Gleason 6 patients who failed surveillance
over a 10-year period [326], but these tests need a full
validation.
ConfrimMDx test from MDxHealth examines
methylation status of a three genes, GSTP1, APC and/
or RASSF1 in PCa biopsies. The company claims that
their test is more accurate in detection of PCa in biopsies,
because it could detect the effects of cancerous growth
in cells adjacent to it, and does not have to rely on the
identification of PCa foci in the needle core biopsies.
Prognostic tests for CRPC. Significant work has
been conducted in order to develop a minimally invasive
diagnostic procedure, considering the risks associated with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

needle biopsies and the fact that biopsies of metastases
present a number of risks and limitations. “Liquid”
biopsies or predictive gene signatures based on DNA and
mRNA analyses of whole blood are being developed. In
one study, an expression signature of six genes was highly
effective in predicting survival [327], and, similarly, a
nine gene signature was highly predictive in another
study [328], but these are relatively far away from clinical
implementation.
Isolation and analysis of circulating tumor cells
(CTC) is a developing technology that is promising in
metastatic cancers. According to several studies, the mere
enumeration of CTCs in blood samples is prognostic and
could be predictive of response to therapies in CRPC
[329-332]. Capture of CTC presents a technological
challenge, such as the frequent EMT observed in CRPC,
which eliminates the expression of epithelial markers
(antibodies to E-cadherin are frequently used to selectively
isolate circulating metastatic cells from whole blood.)
Identification of cell surface markers selectively expressed
on metastatic cells with stem cell/EMT signature is
needed. The challenges and significance of CTC analyses
in PCa were reviewed recently [333, 334].
Reactivation of AR signaling despite continuous
treatment with new drugs such as abiraterone (CYP17A1
inhibitor) is a common phenomenon. Prediction of
response in patients is highly desirable, and a non-invasive
test is much preferred to repeated biopsies. Isolation and
analysis of CTC was explored as a diagnostic or prognostic
factor for ADT. Earlier attempts to analysis of CTC were
limited to quantification only. The feasibility of measuring
the AR pathway activity in CTC was demonstrated [335].
This approach became feasible due to technological
advances in microfluidic capture of CTC and imaging,
enabling single cells immunofluorescence analysis of
AR activity. The “AR-ON” signature was observed in
untreated patients whereas patients with CRPC had mixed
levels of AR activation on, off and mixed). First line ADT
induced a switch from AR-ON to AR-OFF, but secondary
hormonal therapy evoked mixed responses. Responses to
second line ADT (abiraterone) showed presence of “ARmixed” CTCs and increasing “AR-on” cells, which were
associated with an adverse treatment outcome. This test
could be used a predictive of responses to ADT.
Other possibilities for novel non-invasive tests
include mRNA seq in captured CTC [336] and detection
of telomerase hTERT mRNA in plasma [337]. The latter
was reported to be a useful predictor of biochemical
recurrence, and could be considered in combination with
other known markers.

Immunotherapy for PCA
There has always been an interest in development
of immunotherapeutics for PCa, and the only approved
cell-based immunotherapy, Sipuleucel-T, was developed

below.
Immunomodulatory antibodies. A growing
number of trials are ongoing with the immune checkpoint
antibodies in prostate cancer. Ipilimumab, FDA approved
anti-CTLA4 antibody, is in several trials in PCa, including
randomized phase III NCT01057810 for patients with
asymptomatic mCRPC and randomized phase III trial
NCT00861614 with ipilimumab or placebo administered
after radiotherapy. The results of latter trial failed to
reach the primary endpoint of increasing OS, but showed
some signs of activity of ipilimumab that warrant further
investigation [338]. The second study of ipilimumab
which examines the drug in chemotherapy-naïve
patients, is still under way. Ipilimumab is also combined
with Abiraterone and prednisone in a phase II study
NCT01688492 for patients with progressive mCRPC.
Phase II trial NCT01498978 is exploring addition of
ipilimumab to patients with mCRPC under treatment with
ADT agents such as LHRH agonists or antiandrogens
such as bicalutamide. Ipilimumab is also being evaluated
in a neoadjuvant setting (phase II NCT01194271), and in
combination with Sipuleucel-T in phase II NCT01832870,
as well as several other trials.
In spite of successes achieved with anti-PD-1 and
PD-L1 antibodies in other malignancies, there are only
two clinical trials with these agents ongoing for prostate
cancer. NCT01420965 combines sipuleucel and anti-PD-1
antibody CT-011, and anti-PD-L1 antibody MSB0010718C
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combination

is tested in a several cancer types including prostate. The
relative dearth of trials with checkpoint antibodies is most
likely due to the fact that in the trial of BMS-936558, anti
PD-1 antibody, remarkable responses were observed in
patients with melanoma, NSCLC and RCC, but not PCa
[339]. Immunostimulatory antibody to OX-40 is in early
clinical testing (NCT01303705), but will be administered
only on short-term basis after cyclophosphamide. The
antibody is of mouse origin and cannot be used for longer
treatments.
Adoptive cell transfer. Phase I trial NCT01140373
for mCRPC patients is testing harvested autologous T cells
transduced in vitro with CAR (chimeric antigen receptor)
recognizing PSMA. Treatment will involve myeloablation
with cyclophosphamide in patients with CRPC.
An early phase clinical study is exploring potential
of natural killer (NK) cells in various malignancies
including PCa. In particular, this phase I trial
(NCT00720785) will examine if the limited anti-tumor
activity of NK cells could be significantly increased by
pretreating patients with proteasome inhibitor bortezomib,
which has been reported to enhance the sensitivity of
tumor cells to NK killing in numerous studies [340, 341].
In the future, the complex regulation of NK cells activity
by tumors themselves will have to be considered. A very
recent study has demonstrated a striking role of the well
known NK ligand NKG2D in regulating the cytotoxic
activity of NK cells in prostate tumors in a mouse model.
Apparently, membrane-restricted and soluble NKG2D
ligands pose opposite impacts on tumor progression and
7239

Oncotarget

metastasis. The membrane-restricted NKG2D ligand
MICB.A2 could sustain NKG2D protective immunity and
prevent spontaneous tumorigenesis, whereas the native
NKG2D ligand MICB facilitates tumor progression
through soluble ligand-mediated impairment of NK cell
peripheral maintenance [342].
Vaccination. PROSTVAC-V and PROSTVAC-F are
vaccinia and fowlpox based virus vaccines expressing PSA
and TRICOM (three immunostimulatory proteins B7.1,
ICAM-1, and LFA-3), and with GM-CSF. PROSTVAC-V
is given for priming, and PROSTVAC-F for boosting
the response. A phase II trial was completed without
clear clinical benefits, such as increase in PFS, observed.
However, the clinical evaluation of PROSTVAC-V/F
should be re-considered considering different endpoints
for immune therapies [343]. Indeed, evaluation of patients
at three year post-study showed an increase in OS [344].
Phase III trial NCT01322490 for PROSTVAC-V/F with
GM-CSF is in progress. Phase I trial NCT00450463
examines PROSTVAC-V/F-TRICOM versus placebo
in patients treated with flutamide, and phase II
NCT01875250 with enzalutamide. Development of a
humoral response to an viral antigen in PROSTVAC as
reported to be a potential predictive marker for favorable
response to PROST-VAC in patients [345].
Phase II trial NCT01341652 examines PAP
vaccine plus GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone in nonmetastatic PCa. Adenovirus/PSA vaccine is tested in
Phase II NCT00583024 in hormone-refractory PCa, while
NCT00583752 will test the same vaccine in men with
locally treated PCa.
Dendritic cells. Sipuleucel-T/Provenge/ was the
first cellular immunotherapeutic to be approved by the
FDA to treat cancer. This treatment consists of autologous
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) enriched for
a CD54+ DCs (dendritic cells). These are primed in vitro
with the recombinant fusion protein consisting of prostatic
acid phosphatase (PAP) and GM-CSF. This causes the
activation and expansion of the autologous antigenpresenting cells (APCs) and lymphocytes, even though
the precise mechanism is still unknown. Treatment with
Sipuleucel-T does not have an effect on levels of PSA or
radiological parameters of disease, but has a modest effect
on OS.
Sipuleucel-T is also examined as a neoadjuvant in
patients with localized PCa: phase II, NCT00715104;
in combination with external beam radiation therapy
in CRPC patients (NCT01807065, Phase II), and with
abiraterone in phase II NCT01487863. Combination of
Sipuleucel-T with Ipilimumab, an immune checkpoint
antibody targeting inhibitory CTLA-4, is in a phase II
trial NCT01804465 which examines immediate versus
delayed CTLA-4 blockade, and in phase I NCT01832870
for advanced PCa. A trial of Sipuleucel-T with another
checkpoint antibody, CT-011 targeting PD-1 is also
ongoing (NCT01420965, phase II).

BPX-201 DCs vaccine with activating agent AP1903
is undergoing testing in phase I trial NCT01823978 for
mCRPC. DCs in this trial are transduced with adenovirusbased vector expressing PSMA and a fusion protein
composed of synthetic inducible adjuvant iMC, druginducible costimulatory CD40 receptor (iCD40) and the
adaptor protein MyD88, with potential immunomodulating
and antineoplastic activities. The iCD40 contains a
membrane-localized cytoplasmic CD40 domain fused to
the FK506 modified drug-binding protein 12 (FKBP12).
Upon intradermal administration of BPX-201, these DCs
accumulate in local draining lymph nodes. Twenty-four
hours after vaccination, the dimerizing agent AP1903 is
administered. AP1903 binds to the drug binding domain,
leading to iMC oligomerization and activation of iCD40
and MyD88-mediated signaling in iMC-expressing DCs.

New directions
Neoneurogenesis in PCa development. An exciting
new target in treatment of PCA is neoneurogenesis,
or the ingrowth of new nerve endings into a tumor. It
was discovered recently that the autonomous nervous
system plays a direct role in PCa growth and metastasis.
Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in the normal
prostate control the physiological function of both muscle
fibers and epithelial compartment, but their involvement
in PCa was unsuspected. As was demonstrated in [346],
adrenergic fibers from the sympathetic nervous system
contribute to the development of PCa by release of
noradrenaline which stimulates β2- and β3-adrenergic
receptors expressed on smooth muscle cells in the stroma.
Deletion of β2- and β3-adrenergic receptors in stroma
prevented development of PCa in different mouse models
of PCa. Cholinergic fibers of the parasympathetic nervous
system (PNS) stimulate dissemination of prostate cancer
cells by releasing acetylcholine that stimulates muscarinic
receptors on stromal cells. Deletion of type 1 muscarinic
receptors in stroma inhibited tumor invasion and
metastasis. Importantly, higher overall densities of nerve
fibers were detected in PCa patients with poor prognosis
compared to a group with better prognosis. Targeting the
autonomous nervous system could therefore prevent tumor
progression in PCa.
Metabolic regulation of PCa development. A
recent population study performed in Toronto showed
that increasing duration of metformin use among diabetic
men after a diagnosis of prostate cancer was associated
with decreased prostate cancer–speciﬁc and all-cause
mortality [347]. The findings were significant irrespective
of what treatments the subjects were receiving for their
PCa. Metformin is a widely used drug to treat type II
diabetes, and is currently explored in numerous types of
cancer, including PCa, in about 10 trials. In particular,
addition of metformin to various forms of ADT is explored
based on the rationale that ADT is associated with the
7240

Oncotarget

metabolic syndrome, hyperinsulinemia and insulin
resistance. Hyperinsulinemia was reported to stimulate
tumor growth and development of CRPC via activation
of IGFR. Metformin through its activation of the AMPKLKBI pathway reduces liver gluconeogenesis secondarily
decreasing insulin levels, which might explain the effects
on tumor growth. Other effects of metformin on cellular
metabolic processes could contribute to its anti-cancer
properties, such as indirect effects on mTOR and SIRT1.
Metformin acts directly on mitochondrial complex I
reducing respiration rates, and this activity is probably
relevant to the recently demonstrated improvement of
prostate tumors oxygenation and radiotherapy response in
vivo [348]. Metformin use was associated with significant
decrease in biochemical relapse in patients [348].
L-type amino acid transporters (LATs) uptake neutral
amino acids including L-leucine into cells, stimulating
mTORC1 signaling. LAT1 and LAT3 are overexpressed in
PCa, and they are responsible for increasing nutrients and
stimulating cell growth. LAT3, in particular, is expressed
at high levels in all stages of PCA, and its expression is
suppressed after ADT [349]. Pharmacological inhibition
of LATs lead to downregulation of the E2F regulated
M phase genes, and silencing of LAT1 or LAT3 in the
xenograft model inhibited tumor growth and metastases.
[349]
Regulation of AR activity by long noncoding
RNA (lncRNA). A recent study uncovered how two
lncRNAs, PRNCR1 and PCGEM1, overexpressed in
many CRPCs, concordantly enhance AR transcriptional
activity in a complicated series of events. These lncRNAs
localize to chromatin in androgen response area, whereby
PRNCR1 binds the acetylated carboxyl end of AR, recruits
methylase DOTL1, which methylates the amino terminus
of AR, a pre-requisite to binding of PCGEM1. AR-bound
PCGEM recruits protein Pygo2 bound to H3K4me3 on
chromatin in the promoter area, thus inducing chromatin
looping that brings enhancer and promoter area into close
proximity. The proximity of AR bound enhancer and
promoter sequences of target genes results in enhanced
transcription of AR target, many of which contribute
to oncogenesis [350]. These lncRNAs could serve as
therapeutic targets because their silencing inhibited growth
of xenograft tumors.
Potential role of HHV-8 in prostate
carcinogenesis. Presence of HHV-8 (also known as
Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus) in normal prostate, prostate
cancers and biological fluids was reported in a number
of publications, some of which documented higher
prevalence of HHV-8 in prostate cancer or seropositivity
for HHV-8 in PCa patients, while others reported no such
association. In general, HHV-8 infection was not linked
etiologically to PCa. However, a recent publication
reported that HHV-8 infection of androgen-responsive PCa
cells confers androgen-independent growth via activation
of EZH2 controlled gene silencing [351]. These findings
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

warrant further investigation of the role that HHV-8 might
play in development of CRPC.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Even though NGS studies were conducted for
prostate cancer, the identification of well defined and
clinically meaningful subtypes based on genomic profiling
has been difficult. It is likely due to the high number of
molecular alterations that contribute to the development of
localized PCa. For example, about half of prostate cancers
have translocations involving the ETS family members,
but these are not sufficient to cause frank PCa. The
additional alterations that cooperate with deregulated ETS
are many, and presumably each of them (for example, loss
of PTEN versus loss of TP53 function) could determine
the precise clinical subtype of the emerging tumor. The
other known drivers of the PCa early development (in
fusion-negative cancers) are also several: SPOP mutation,
SPINK overexpression, CHD1 deletion and TAK1 loss, as
well as chromosomal losses not characterized in terms of
genes involved. These molecular subtypes of PCa await
analysis of the clinical significance of the underlying
somatic changes.
The pervasive involvement of AR signaling in the
later stages of PCa presents a conundrum as well, because
it affects an entire massive transcriptional program that
is further affected by additional alterations in tumor
suppressors, transcription factors, chromatin remodeling
enzymes and, almost universally, developmental factors.
These multiple perturbations in advanced PCa present
great difficulties in terms of not only treatments, but
also identification of biomarkers of risk or prognostic/
theranostic value.
Since androgen regulated pathways are affected in
the vast majority of advanced PCa, the ADT is a logical
therapeutic intervention. The persistent significance of
the AR signaling in CRPC was recently validated by the
evidence of the clinical efficacy of androgen synthesis
inhibitors (abiraterone) and the novel, second-generation
AR antagonists (enzalutamide). However, ADT is
often used under circumstances where the mechanisms
of resistance to it are most likely already present in
a subpopulation of PCa cells. One possibility is the
existence of a compartment of the androgen-independent
cells with characteristics of stemness that already have the
driver mutations such as ETS translocation or PTEN loss,
and that are propelled into reproduction and acquisition
of further genetic changes by the drop in androgen levels.
Alternatively, a population of androgen independent or
almost independent cells might emerge as a consequence
of the ADT by selecting rare cells with de novo alterations
in other signaling, developmental or epigenetic pathways
that bypass the need for androgen signaling.
The universal development of resistance to ADT,
including the newest agents, is a testimony not only to the
7241

Oncotarget

adaptability of the activity of AR pathway to the low or
even absent androgens, but also an evidence of enormous
adaptability of PCa cellular oncogenic pathways.
Resistance to ADT is enormously important clinically,
and is the subject of intense research (reviewed in [135,
352, 353]. Emergence of CRPC subtypes (like NEPC) that
do not express AR and therefore are truly independent of
androgen signaling presents a clinical conundrum that
warrants more research in treatment options.
It is becoming a shared understanding that in the
future, ADT will be administered as one component
in a combination of therapies, to try and forestall the
development of resistance. However, the real conundrum
will be to find a right “partner” to the ADT. The problem
lies in the identification of the particular pre-existing or
emerging alterations that ultimately contribute to the
resistance to ADT. The acknowledged role of the tumor
heterogeneity in this process is hard to dispute. However,
it is difficult to address it in the context of limited biopsies,
even if several are taken from the tumor. Comprehensive
genomic analysis of the CTCs or free circulating tumor
DNA might be a step toward identification of mutations
present in heterogeneous subpopulations of tumor or its
metastases.
