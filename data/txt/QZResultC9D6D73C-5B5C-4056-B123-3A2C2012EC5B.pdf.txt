Abstract
The chemokine receptor CXCR3 has been proposed to play a critical role in host antitumor responses. In this
study, we defined CXCR3-expressing immune cell infiltration in human skin squamous cell carcinomas and then
used CXCR3-deficient mice to assess the contribution of CXCR3 to skin tumorigenesis. Our studies employed
two established protocols for chemical skin carcinogenesis [methylcholanthrene (MCA) or 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)
anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) models]. CXCR3 deletion did not affect tumor
development in the MCA model; however, CXCR3 was important in the DMBA/TPA model where gene deletion
reduced the incidence of skin tumors. This decreased incidence of skin tumors did not reflect differences in
epidermal development but rather was associated with reduced epidermal thickness and proliferation in
CXCR3/ mice, implicating the CXCR3 pathway in DMBA/TPA-induced epidermal inflammation and proliferation. Notably, CXCR3 expressed in CD4þ and CD8þ T cells was found to be important for enhanced
epidermal proliferation. Specifically, CXCR3-deficient mice reconstituted with T cells isolated from wild-type
mice treated with DMBA/TPA restored wild-type levels of epidermal proliferation in the mutant mice. Taken
together, our findings establish that CXCR3 promotes epidermal tumorigenesis likely through a T-cell–
dependent induction of keratinocyte proliferation. Cancer Res; 71(17); 5707–16. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The chemokine receptor CXCR3 and its 3 ligands CXCL9,
CXCL10, and CXCL11 are part of a large family of chemotactic
cytokines whose major function is the chemoattraction of
specific hematopoietic cellular subsets during homeostatic or
inflammatory conditions. In addition, chemokines function in
diverse processes such as T-cell proliferation, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis (1–3). The majority of studies assessing
the role of CXCR3 in tumor growth and rejection have relied
on enforced expression of ligands in syngeneic tumors, xenograft, or therapeutic models. For example, enforced CXCL10
expression in melanoma xenografts or CXCL9/10 in lymphoma xenografts reduced, but did not abrogate, growth of
tumors in immunodeficient mice (4–6). CXCL10 was also

implicated as the critical mediator of actions of interleukin
12 (IL12) in a therapeutic model of tumor rejection via its
effects on angiogenesis (7). Thus, limited studies to date have
explored the role of endogenously produced CXCR3 ligands or
their receptor in the host antitumor response in models of
primary tumor development.
To address the role of CXCR3 in skin tumorigenesis, we first
analyzed human cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (CSCC)
and identified infiltration of CXCR3-expressing cells. We then
utilized CXCR3 null mice in 2 of the most well-characterized
chemical carcinogen models of primary tumor formation—
the methylcholanthrene (MCA) fibrosarcoma and the 7,12dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) skin tumor systems. Over the last 15
years, Schreiber (8), Smyth (9), and other groups used the MCA
model to show that the impact of the immune system on
nascently transformed cells results in successful control of
neoplastic growth consistent with the predictions of Burnet
and Thomas and which is now more broadly described as
cancer immunoediting (10–12). Dissection of this dynamic
process has revealed the critical role of lymphocytes and
immunologically relevant cytokines in protecting the murine
host from primary tumor development. For example, mice
deficient in the IFNg receptor a-chain (IFNGR1) display an
increased MCA-induced tumor burden compared with wildtype (WT) counterparts (13). Importantly, the downstream
mediators of the actions of IFNg have been incompletely
defined but may include CXCR3 ligands, which are directly
induced by this cytokine. Although MCA carcinogenesis has

been utilized predominantly to reveal the host-protective
actions of the immune system, it is surprisingly also influenced
by inflammation (14). A second commonly used model, based
on DMBA/TPA application, revealed the essential role of
epithelial restricted gd T cells in immune surveillance (15).
However, this model has also been utilized to show the
contribution of cancer-promoting inflammation. Mice deficient in tumor-promoting CD8þ T cells (16), inflammatory
molecules, such as COX-2 (17), or inflammatory environment
regulators such as RAGE (18), all show a decreased incidence
of tumors compared with WT mice. Thus, depending on the
model, the specific polarization of the immune response to
one that is either inflammatory or host protective leads to 1 of
2 diametrically opposed outcomes for the host (19).
Herein, we detail our findings using both of these classical
carcinogenesis models in CXCR3/ mice where (i) DMBA/
TPA treatment revealed decreased tumor development, suggesting that CXCR3 contributes to the inflammatory environment and (11) no role was found for CXCR3 in protecting mice
from carcinogenesis in the MCA system. Although there were
no developmental differences between WT and CXCR3/
mice in epidermal differentiation markers, analysis of epidermal proliferation in response to DMBA/TPA showed a
decreased proliferative response in CXCR3/ mice. We then
determined that both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells, known CXCR3expressing cells, were the critical immune cells regulating
epidermal proliferation in WT mice and were able to reconstitute the epidermal proliferation deficit in CXCR3/ mice.
Whereas CXCR3 does not affect immune surveillance in MCA
carcinogenesis, it does promote DMBA/TPA tumor development and enhances DMBA/TPA T-cell–dependent keratinocyte proliferation.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Studies were conducted under approved protocols of the
Animal Studies Committees of Washington University and the
Department of Veteran's Affairs. C57BL/6 and RAG2/
C57BL/6 (both from Taconic Farms) and CXCR3/ mice
were used (20). Mice were maintained in a specific pathogenfree environment and were sex and age matched for
experiments.
Antibodies
Antibodies to mouse CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (RM4-5), CD8
(Ly-2, 53-6.7), CD16/CD32 (2.4G2), CD45 (30-F11), Gr-1 (RB6/
8C5), CD11b (M1/70), gd TCR (GL3), Vg5 (536), human CXCR3
(1C6), and isotype controls were from BioLegend and BD
Biosciences. For in vivo studies, control and antibodies targeting CD4, CD8, and NK1.1 were from Bio X Cell. Anti-keratin
antibodies were from Covance.
Cutaneous carcinogenesis
The protocol of Roberts and colleagues (21) was followed
with 100 mg DMBA for initiation and 25 mg TPA for promotion
(both from Sigma). Tumor development was monitored
weekly, and lesions greater than 2 mm in size were counted

as positive. A short-term experiment was also adapted where
back skin was shaved, treated with a single dose of DMBA
followed by 3 doses of TPA, and harvested 16 to 20 hours after
the final TPA application. For MCA carcinogenesis, tumors
were induced and monitored as described (13).
Immunohistochemistry
Skin samples were fixed in formalin, paraffin embedded,
and sectioned. After antigen retrieval using an IHC-Tek epitope retrieval set (IHC World), incubations were carried out
with the primary (4 C overnight) and secondary biotinylated
IgG (room temperature: 30 min). The Vectastain Elite ABC and
Peroxidase Substrate Kit were used for detection (Vector
Laboratories). Immunohistochemical sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific). Human CSCC
samples were obtained under a Washington University Institutional Review Board–approved protocol and were immunostained after citrate-based antigen retrieval (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) with an antibody to human CXCR3 (1C6; BD
Pharmingen). They were evaluated by a single study pathologist (M.E. Pittman) for the presence of staining in both
lymphocytes and tumor cells. Staining was subjectively graded
on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 representing scattered cell staining,
2 clusters, and 3 large aggregates or bands.
ELISA
CXCL9 and CXCL10 kits (R&D Systems) were used to detect
protein in total lysates from mouse skin.
Proliferation analysis
DMBA/TPA-treated mice (16–20 hours after last TPA dosing) were injected with 100 mg/kg of bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd; Sigma) either 1 or 24 hours before harvest. BrdUrd
staining on fixed sections was carried out using the Labeling
and Detection Kit II (Roche) according to the manufacturer's
protocol with eosin counterstain (Fisher Scientific). All
BrdUrdþ cells and total basal keratinocytes were counted
for each section. A proliferation index was calculated using
the formula [(total number BrdUrdþ cells/total number of
basal keratinocytes)  1,000) to compare between sections.
Fetal liver chimeric mice
Fetal liver cells from E13.5 embryos were harvested and
transferred into sublethally radiated (1,100 rads) recipient
mice. Fetal liver cells have been successfully used to reconstitute epidermal T-cell responses (22). Mice were allowed to
reconstitute for 12 weeks and analyzed for appropriate reconstitution by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of
splenocytes at the end of the DMBA/TPA experiments.
Skin-infiltrating lymphocyte analysis
Epidermal preparations of DMBA/TPA-treated skin were
made by treating with Dispase II (2.4 units/mL; Roche) at 37 C
for 2 to 4 hours. Single-cell suspensions were generated by
treatment with 0.25% trypsin (Hyclone), filtered, washed, and
plated overnight in complete RPMI medium to allow antigen
reexpression (21). Staining and FACS were carried out as
described (8, 23).

CXCR3 in Skin Tumorigenesis

Hyperplasia
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained DMBA/TPA-treated
mouse skin was analyzed for the thickness of the epidermis
using a calibrated ocular micrometer (at 40).
Adoptive T-cell transfers
WT or CXCR3/ spleen and lymph nodes were used to
isolate CD3þ T cells using magnetic bead–based negative
selection (Miltenyi Biotec). Purity of cells was between 85%
and 95% by FACS and 15  106 purified CD3þ cells were
transferred into the indicated recipients 1 week after DMBA
application, followed by short-course TPA (3 doses) treatment
and analysis for BrdUrd incorporation.
Statistics
All statistical analysis was conducted in Prism (GraphPad Software). Tumor incidence in the MCA groups was
analyzed by survival curve analysis and the log-rank
(Mantel–Cox) test. The paired, 2-tailed Student's t test
was used for the DMBA/TPA experiments and an
unpaired, 2-tailed Student's t test was used to analyze
all other data. A P < 0.05 value was considered significant
and all error bars represent SEM.

Results
CXCR3 is expressed on infiltrating cells in human CSCC
To assess the association of CXCR3 with human CSCC, we
examined 24 individual patient samples by immunohistochemistry for CXCR3-expressing cells (Fig. 1A). The key
findings of these analyses were that (i) CXCR3 expression
was limited to infiltrating cells and was not present on
tumor cells, (ii) the majority of tumors (20 of 24) had strong
(grade 3) peritumoral CXCR3þ cells, (3) intratumoral
CXCR3þ staining was more variable (Fig. 1C; grade 1 ¼ 9,
grade 2 ¼ 8, and grade 3 ¼ 6), and (4) no CXCR3 was detected
on adjacent normal epidermis (Fig. 1B). This analysis showed
that infiltrating cells expressing CXCR3 were present in human
CSCC and that neither tumor nor other adjacent normal cells
express CXCR3. Because of a limited number of samples,
patient outcomes relative to CXCR3 expression could not be
determined.
CXCR3 promotes DMBA/TPA tumorigenesis
To assess the role of CXCR3 in tumor development, we first
compared the susceptibilities of WT and CXCR3/ mice in
DMBA/TPA tumorigenesis. Groups of male WT C57BL/6 and
CXCR3/ mice were treated with DMBA (100 mg) followed by
twice weekly TPA (25 mg) and monitored for tumor development (Fig. 1D). Note the background of the CXCR3/ mice
was confirmed via genome-wide analysis of informative polymorphic markers between the 129Sv/Ev and C57BL/6 strains,
which showed that the gene-deficient mice were 99.3% (145 of
146 markers) C57BL/6 strain (data not shown). These experiments showed that, as a group, the CXCR3/ mice developed
2-fold fewer tumors per mouse compared with WT mice.
Similar results were obtained in independent, repeat experiments with male and female mice (combined cohort totals for

www.aacrjournals.org

all experiments were 59 WT and 45 CXCR3/ mice). The
difference in tumor incidence between WT and CXCR3/
mice was more robust in males than in females, which led us
to use males for the remainder of this study (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B). In separate experiments, directly comparing
male and female cohorts, we noted a significant gender
difference in that WT males were more sensitive than females
to DMBA/TPA, whereas male and female CXCR3/ mice
were uniformly resistant to tumor development (data not
shown). C57BL/6 mice develop mostly papillomas in response
to DMBA/TPA with rare progression to SCCs (24). In these
experiments, there were no differences in tumor sizes or
progression to carcinomas between WT and CXCR3/ mice
(data not shown). Thus, CXCR3 has a tumor-promoting role in
the inflammation-induced DMBA/TPA model of cutaneous
tumorigenesis.
Similar incidence of MCA-induced tumors in CXCR3/
and WT mice
Although the MCA model has been critical for delineating
the central tenets of cancer immunoediting, it also relies on
an inflammatory contribution for tumor development (14).
To assess the role of CXCR3 deficiency in fibrosarcoma
development, large cohorts of WT (n ¼ 60), RAG2/
(n ¼ 29), and CXCR3/ (n ¼ 67) mice were injected with
2 different doses of MCA and monitored. Consistent with the
known role for lymphocytes in immunosurveillance, all 14
RAG2/ mice developed tumors when treated with 25 mg of
MCA compared with 20 of 29 WT mice (P ¼ 0.0067, data not
shown). In contrast, CXCR3/ mice displayed tumor incidences that were similar to that of WT mice both at the
25-mg dose where 24 of 34 mice developed tumors (Fig. 1E)
and at a 6.25-mg dose (Supplementary Fig. S1C). In addition,
CXCR3/ mice were transplanted with 21 different RAG
regressor tumors, which are RAG2/-derived tumor cell
lines that are rejected in WT mice and grow progressively in
RAG2/ mice (8, 23). These experiments revealed that the
vast majority (20 of 21) of transplanted tumor lines underwent rejection in CXCR3/ mice similar to WT mice
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). Thus, CXCR3 did not contribute
to immune surveillance or tumor promotion in MCA carcinogenesis and was very rarely required to reject transplanted tumors.
No differences in epidermal differentiation in CXCR3/
versus WT mice
Two possible explanations for the effects of CXCR3 on skin
tumor development were that there was an inherent developmental defect in CXCR3/ skin or that there was dysregulated chemokine biology influencing the developing tumor
or microenvironment. To address the former possibility, we
first examined standard H&E-stained WT and CXCR3/ skin
and saw no differences (data not shown). To compare developmental markers in the epidermis, immunohistochemistry
was used to assess keratin expression in WT and CXCR3/
mice. In untreated mice, the epidermis is thin and no keratin
differences were observed. To better examine keratin distribution, DMBA/TPA-treated skin was stained and showed no

differences in the distribution of keratin 5, which is expressed
in all layers of epidermal keratinocytes (data not shown) and
of keratin 1, which is expressed only in developing but not
basal keratinocytes (Fig. 2A and B). Therefore, CXCR3 deficiency has no effect on epidermal development and thus, the
decreased tumor development must be because of altered
chemokine biology.
DMBA/TPA treatment induces CXCL9 and CXCL10
To establish that CXCR3 ligands are induced in DMBA/
TPA-treated mouse skin thus serving as a target for CXCR3
expressing cells, we assessed ligand levels by ELISA. Importantly, we focused only on CXCL9 and CXCL10 because
C57BL/6 mice do not express CXCL11 due to a 2-bp insertion
in the coding sequence that leads to a premature stop codon
(25). Untreated or vehicle-treated skin (no differences between
these 2 were noted) had low levels of both CXCL9 and CXCL10
protein in both WT and CXCR3/ mice (Fig. 2C and D). Upon
DMBA/TPA treatment, significant induction of CXCL9 and
CXCL10 was detected in both WT and CXCR3/ mice.
Interestingly, compared with WT mice, CXCR3/ mice had
significantly lower levels of both CXCL9 and CXCL10, suggesting that CXCR3-expressing cells potentially induce expression
of CXCR3 ligands in a feed-forward pathway. Thus, consistent
with the effects of CXCR3 in tumor development, DMBA/TPA
led to the induction of CXCR3 ligands in the skin.

CXCR3/ mice have decreased hyperplasia in response
to DMBA/TPA
As there were no differences in epidermal cell differentiation, we then asked whether there was a differential response
to DMBA/TPA between WT and CXCR3/ mice. Epidermal
hyperplasia was analyzed in mouse skin treated with DMBA
and then 3 doses of TPA (Fig. 3A, short term) or DMBA and
then biweekly TPA for 30 weeks (Fig. 3B, long term) by
measuring the thickness from the basement membrane to
the stratum corneum. In the short-term protocol, there was a
decrease in the mean measured thickness from 73.7  4.9 mm
in WT mice to 53.9  1.3 mm in CXCR3/ mice, and in the
long-term protocol, the mean measured thickness decreased
from 71.2  3 mm in WT mice to 51.8  2.7 mm in CXCR3/
mice. These data suggest that WT mice have a CXCR3dependent epidermal proliferative response to DMBA/TPA.
In addition, the short-term assay replicates the findings of the
long-term assay at the level of epidermal hyperplasia and
provides a surrogate assay to dissect the components contributing to CXCR3 related epidermal proliferation.
Decreased epidermal proliferation in CXCR3/ mice
As the epidermal hyperplasia assessment provides a "snapshot" end result view of DMBA/TPA treatment, we next
asked whether BrdUrd incorporation in proliferating keratinocytes would also reveal differences between WT and

CXCR3/ mice, as this is a more dynamic assay revealing
specific cellular behavior. Using both DMBA/TPA application
protocols (short and long), mice were pulsed for 1 hour with
BrdUrd followed by immediate harvest of skin. Incorporated
BrdUrd was detected after antigen recovery and a proliferation index was calculated for each stained section by counting
BrdUrd-positive cells and normalizing this number relative to
total numbers of basal keratinocytes. As expected, keratinocyte proliferation was increased relative to untreated mice
(data not shown). However, there was a marked contrast in
the proliferative response upon DMBA/TPA application
between WT and CXCR3/ mice (Fig. 3C–E). In WT mice,
more basal keratinocytes incorporated BrdUrd both in
the short-term (proliferation index of 522.6  27 WT vs.
165.7  9.5 in CXCR3/ mice) and in the long-term protocols
(proliferation index of 482  19.8 WT vs. 310.1  30.3 in
CXCR3/ mice). When BrdUrd was injected 24 hours prior
to harvest of skin, the differences between WT and CXCR3/
mice continued and extended into the upper layers of the
epidermis (Fig. 3F). Whereas WT mice showed incorporation
of BrdUrd into proliferating basal keratinocytes and migration
of these cells, CXCR3/ mice continued to have both poor
basal proliferation and decreased migration. We also examined these sections by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and saw

no differences between WT and CXCR3/ mice (data not
shown). These data show that CXCR3 deficiency leads to
impaired DMBA/TPA-induced proliferation in the epidermis.
CXCR3-expressing hematopoietic cells drive
proliferation
Having shown a quantitative difference in the response of
WT versus CXCR3/ mice to DMBA/TPA treatment, the
specific compartment (hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic)
where CXCR3 acts to promote this phenotype was next
addressed. Although most data show that CXCR3 expression
is limited to immune cells and we found no CXCR3 expression in human epidermis (Fig. 1B), some groups suggest that
it is also expressed in keratinocytes (e.g., see ref. 26). To
address this issue, we generated chimeric mice by sublethal
radiation of recipient mice and subsequent transfer of fetal
liver cells to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Using
this technique, we generated 4 different groups of mice (i)
WT!WT, (ii) WT!CXCR3/, (iii) WT!RAG2/, and (iv)
CXCR3/!RAG2/. RAG2/ mice were used as recipients to avoid any contribution of radio-resistant CXCR3expressing B or T cells. At the end of the experiments,
all mice were analyzed by counting total splenocytes
and FACS for CXCR3-expressing lymphocyte populations
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Reconstitution restored splenocyte

Using these mice, we then assessed epidermal proliferation
after DMBA/TPA using the BrdUrd incorporation assay. As
shown in Figure 4, we found that all mice expressing CXCR3 in
the hematopoietic compartment displayed proliferation rates
similar to WT mice. These groups and proliferation indexes
were (i) WT!WT, 481.6  27.9; (ii) WT!RAG2/, 495.2 
35.4; and (iii) WT!CXCR3/, 478.7  10.4. In contrast, mice
that lacked CXCR3 in the hematopoietic compartment (the
CXCR3/!RAG2/ mice) had significantly decreased epidermal proliferation (index ¼ 249.3  28.2). The proliferation
index from CXCR3/ !RAG2/ was similar to that seen in
DMBA/TPA-treated CXCR3/ mice (data not shown). These
findings show that CXCR3 is necessary and sufficient in

hematopoietic cells to induce epidermal proliferation by
DMBA/TPA treatment.
T cells promote epidermal proliferation
Having shown that CXCR3 is important in the hematopoietic compartment for DMBA/TPA-induced responses, we next
addressed which subset(s) of the CXCR3-expressing immune
cell(s) were involved. CXCR3 was originally associated with
CD4þTh1 differentiation (28, 29), and in our previous work, we
established that the major CXCR3-expressing cells in naive
mice included populations of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells, a subset
of NK and all NK-T cells (27). To compare possible epidermal
infiltration differences between WT and CXCR3/ mice, we
used FACS to characterize the immune infiltrate in epidermal
preparations of untreated or DMBA/TPA-treated mice. We
found minimal infiltration of NK or NK-T cells into treated
skin in either set of mice (data not shown). As expected, there
was an overall increase in inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of CD11bþ/Gr1þ and T-cell subsets in both WT and
CXCR3/ mice after DMBA/TPA treatment. However, there
were no differences in infiltration of CD11bþ, CD11bþ/Gr1þ,
or importantly epidermal Vg5þ gd T cells in WT mice compared with CXCR3/ mice (either untreated or DMBA/TPA
treated, Supplementary Fig. S3). The most significant difference noted was a modest but statistically significant decrease
of both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells in DMBA/TPA-treated
CXCR3/ mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 5A).
Having shown a decreased infiltration of T cells into treated
CXCR3/ mouse epidermis, we next assessed their contribution to CXCR3-dependent epidermal proliferation. WT mice
were treated with control or depleting monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) that ablated CD4-, CD8-, or NK1.1-expressing populations. By FACS analysis of mouse spleens at the end of the
experiment, the specific cell populations were reduced by
more than 95% (data not shown). After mAb treatment, mice
were treated with DMBA/TPA and analyzed with the BrdUrd
proliferation assay. In these experiments, the proliferation
index for WT and CXCR3/ mice was 550  37 and 187 
15, respectively. Treatment of WT mice with a rat IgG
control resulted in a proliferation index of 517  20,
which was significantly reduced in mice treated with aCD8
mAb (255  19) or aCD4 mAb (374  14.9). When we depleted
mice with aNk1.1 mAb, no decrease in the proliferation index
was apparent compared with mice treated with control mouse
mAb (Fig. 5B). These experiments revealed that CD4þ or CD8þ
T cells had the capacity to induce epidermal proliferation in
response to short-course DMBA/TPA treatment.
CXCR3þ T cells reconstitute epidermal proliferation in
CXCR3/ mice
Finally, having identified that T cells could promote DMBA/
TPA-induced epidermal proliferation in WT mice, we next
asked whether CXCR3/ mice could be reconstituted with
WT total CD3þ T cells to enhance epidermal proliferation.
This was tested using the short-term DMBA/TPA protocol and
by transferring purified CD3þ T cells from WT mice into
CXCR3/ mice 1 week after DMBA treatment. T cells were
transferred after DMBA treatment due to previous reports of

similar successful reconstitution (21) and as the proinflammatory effects in this model are due to TPA application (18). In
addition, separate CXCR3/ mice receiving cells from
CXCR3/ donors served as controls. When tested in these
experiments, CXCR3/ mice again displayed a reduction in
BrdUrd incorporation with the proliferation index falling from
487  15 to 255  54.3 (Fig. 6A). When CXCR3/ mice were
reconstituted with WT CD3þ T cells, the proliferation index
increased to 428  29 (representative image Fig. 6B). In
contrast, control CXCR3/ mice that received T cells purified
from CXCR3/ mice displayed a proliferation index of 299 
38, which was significantly lower than mice that received WT T
cells (representative image, Fig. 6C). Thus, WT T cells, but not
CXCR3/ T cells, are able to complement the DMBA/TPAinduced epidermal proliferation deficiency in CXCR3/ mice.

Previous studies have implicated CXCR3 and its ligands as
mediators of tumor growth inhibition via effects both on
protective host immune infiltration and tumor vasculature.
All of these studies relied on therapeutic manipulation of
transplanted tumors (e.g., see refs. 7, 30–32) and many of
these studies were xenografts in the setting of immunodeficient mice, which ignores the actions of CXCR3 and its
ligands on the immune system (e.g., see refs. 4–6). One study
showed that CXCR3 deficiency in the TRAMP prostate
cancer model enhanced tumor growth; however, the genetic
background of these mice and CXCR3 expression on prostate cancer cells themselves makes the interpretation of the
immune impact on tumor development unclear (33, 34).
Importantly, all these studies shed light on the capacity of
CXCR3 and its ligands to contribute to angiostasis and
immune infiltration but the question of the role of endogenously produced CXCR3 chemokines in primary tumor
development in immunocompetent hosts remained

unanswered. We chose to address this question by assessing
the contribution of CXCR3 in 2 commonly utilized chemical
carcinogen–induced tumor models. Both the MCA and
DMBA/TPA models have been used to dissect the contribution of immune system to tumor development in hostprotective and tumor-promoting modes. We found that
CXCR3 promoted tumor development in the DMBA/TPA
model, whereas it had no role in MCA carcinogenesis or in
rejection of transplantable, immunogenic tumor cell lines.
CXCR3 was important for epidermal proliferation in
response to DMBA/TPA, and this effect was likely due to
CXCR3 activity in the CD3þ T cells of the hematopoietic
system. As has been documented in a number of studies, we
used epidermal proliferation and thickness as surrogate
markers for tumor development (reviewed in ref. 24) and
we will focus our future studies on translating this finding to
the causation of tumorigenesis by specific subsets of T cells.
These studies support a model where CXCR3 chemokines
are induced in response to DMBA/TPA treatment and
recruit CXCR3-expressing CD4þ and CD8þ cells that induce
inflammatory epidermal proliferation, which, in the context
of DMBA-induced RAS mutations, then promotes tumor
development. Consistent with this, CXCR3/ mice would
recruit fewer CD4þ and CD8þ T cells relative to WT mice
thus attenuating the inflammatory environment, resulting
in decreased tumorigenesis. WT T-cell transfers into
CXCR3/ mice followed by tumorigenesis will delineate the
specific T-cell requirements and further clarify this model—
these experiments will be the subject of a follow-up study. In
contrast, CXCR3 is not involved in promoting or preventing
MCA-induced sarcoma development. This minimal effect may

reflect a redundancy in the chemokine system that allows
lymphocyte recruitment in the absence of CXCR3. In FACS
analysis of some of the RAG regressor tumors transplanted into
WT or CXCR3/ mice, where the vast majority of tumors
transplanted into CXCR3/ mice were rejected at the same
kinetics as WT mice (20 of 21 tumors; Supplementary Fig. S1D),
minimal differences were noted in lymphocyte recruitment,
suggesting that CXCR3 did not contribute to recruiting the
critical lymphocytes needed for tumor rejection (data not
shown). These results, along with our previous work definitively showing that IFNg is required for MCA tumor surveillance, suggest that IFNg-mediated surveillance of MCA
sarcomas is not dependent on CXCR3.
Our initial analysis of human CSCC showed an association
of CXCR3-expressing infiltrating cells especially in peritumoral regions. The impact of this infiltrate in clinically
evident tumors is unclear, as opposed to our findings in
the mouse system where CXCR3-expressing cells enhance
tumor development. Several studies on inflammatory lesions
such as those found in psoriasis and in CSCC have repeatedly shown an association with CXCR3þ lymphocytes. For
example, CXCR3-expressing CD8þ T cells have been found at
the basal epidermal layer in lichenoid graft-versus-host
disease and in lichen planus lesions (35) and dermal
CXCR3þ-expressing CD3þ T cells were strongly associated
with psoriatic plaques (36). In CSCC, a strong IFN-associated
transcriptional signature, including CXCL9, and immunohistochemical evidence of CXCR3þ cells, CD3þ cells, and
granzyme Bþ cells correlating with the signature have been
described (37). No studies have correlated patient outcomes
with CXCR3 receptor or ligand expression. Clearly, the

association of CXCR3-expresing cells in human CSCC—
either correlatively or causally—deserves further study.
Relevant to our findings are 3 other investigations on the
role of other chemokines and receptors in DMBA/TPA skin
tumorigenesis. In their findings on the contribution of TNFa
to DMBA/TPA tumorigenesis, Moore and colleagues also
examined the role of CCL2 (MCP-1 or monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) and found a 50% reduction in tumor
development in CCL2/ mice (38). Although these investigators did not pursue the associated mechanisms in these
mice, further work by Nibbs and colleagues on the decoy
chemokine receptor D6 revealed a critical role for chemokinemediated inflammation in tumor development (39). D6 acts as
a sink to remove the inflammatory CC (iCC) class of chemokines, which includes CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8,
CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22. Thus, D6/ mice, which have a
reduced clearance of iCC, develop a T-cell–dependent exaggerated inflammatory epidermal response which is associated
with enhanced tumor development in response to DMBA/TPA
application. Finally, CXCR2 expression on keratinocytes was
found to be critical for epidermal migration and tumorigenesis (40).
The broad range of chemokines addressed by the decoy
receptor D6 did not reveal the specific contributing molecules
for controlling tumorigenesis but highlighted the effects of Tcell trafficking to epidermal inflammation. Other skin conditions, such as allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and atopic
dermatitis, are mediated by an inflammatory infiltrate that
includes neutrophils and T cells and is, in a large part,
dependent on specific chemokine production in the epidermal
compartment (reviewed in ref. 41). The involvement of CXCR3
in skin wound healing has been the focus of several studies
and the specific mechanism is under investigation (26, 42, 43).
In skin tumorigenesis induced by DMBA/TPA, T-cell contributions are variable depending on the genetic background of
the mouse and the dose of TPA used to promote cutaneous
lesions. For example, in the FVB/n strain, CD4þ and CD8þ T
cells have a protective role when promoted with low-dose
TPA. However, with high-dose TPA, a population of IL-17–
producing RORgtþ CD8þ T cells promoted malignant degeneration of benign lesions (16, 21). In contrast, in C3H/HeN,
where allergic contact hypersensitivity to DMBA plays a key
role in tumor development, CD8þ T cells are host protective
and CD4þ T cells promoted tumor development (44). Our data
on epidermal hyperplasia in the C57BL/6 background revealed
a contribution of both CD8þ and CD4þ T cells—the characterization of how CXCR3 and these cells work together in
this model constitutes our current focus. Candidates for the
cytokines emanating from these T cells to promote DMBA/

TPA tumorigenesis include IL-17 (45) and IFNg (46). In addition, we noted a gender difference in tumor development with
WT male mice developing more tumors (data not shown). To
our knowledge, this has not been described previously for the
DMBA/TPA model but gender differences in UVB-induced
skin tumorigenesis (47) and DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinomas have been reported (48). Interestingly, the latter
study involves differential secretion of IL-6, which has been
shown to be a growth factor for keratinocytes and may
potentially promote tumor formation (49). Finally, the CXCR3
ligand(s) regulating lymphocyte recruitment to the skin are
undefined. Notably, C57BL/6 mice do not express CXCL11
(25), thus identifying either CXCL9 or CXCL10 (or both) as the
chemoattractant signal. Analysis of DMBA/TPA-treated skin
showed induction of both chemokines but the levels were
reduced in CXCR3/ mice, suggesting the lack of an inducing
signal. Although speculative, one possible scenario is that the
reduced immune infiltrate in CXCR3/ mice results in a
decrease of a chemokine-inducing cytokine. Our current work
is aimed at defining the specific cytokine(s) and other chemokines contributing to tumor development. In conclusion,
our work highlights the influence of CXCR3-expressing T cells
in epidermal proliferation and likely tumorigenesis and lays
the foundation for further delineation of specific chemoattractant pathways in cutaneous tumorigenesis.
