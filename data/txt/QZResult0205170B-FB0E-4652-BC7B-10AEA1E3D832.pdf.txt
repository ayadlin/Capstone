Abstract
Although there are considerable data on the use of mathematical modeling to describe tumor growth and response to therapy,
previous approaches are often not of the form that can be easily
applied to clinical data to generate testable predictions in individual patients. Thus, there is a clear need to develop and apply
clinically relevant oncologic models that are amenable to available patient data and yet retain the most salient features of
response prediction. In this study we show how a biomechanical
model of tumor growth can be initialized and constrained by
serial patient-speciﬁc magnetic resonance imaging data, obtained
at two time points early in the course of therapy (before initiation
and following one cycle of therapy), to predict the response for
individual patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant
therapy. Using our mechanics coupled modeling approach, we are

able to predict, after the ﬁrst cycle of therapy, breast cancer patients
that would eventually achieve a complete pathologic response
and those who would not, with receiver operating characteristic
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, sensitivity of 92%, and
speciﬁcity of 84%. Our approach signiﬁcantly outperformed the
AUCs achieved by standard (i.e., not mechanically coupled)
reaction–diffusion predictive modeling (0.75), simple analysis
of the tumor cellularity estimated from imaging data (0.73), and
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (0.71). Thus, we
show the potential for mathematical model prediction for use as a
prognostic indicator of response to therapy. The work indicates
the considerable promise of image-driven biophysical modeling
for predictive frameworks within therapeutic applications. Cancer

Neoadjuvant therapy is often administered to patients with
locally advanced breast cancer in order to reduce the tumor
burden prior to surgery (10). Patients exhibiting pathologic
complete response (pCR; deﬁned as no residual viable tumor on
histologic analysis in breast or nodes at the completion of therapy) demonstrate signiﬁcantly enhanced disease-free progression/survival; thus, this metric has emerged as the gold standard
for evaluating response to neoadjuvant therapy (11, 12). With
numerous neoadjuvant therapy regimens available, and many
more treatments emerging, reliable prediction of patients that will
go on to achieve pCR is highly signiﬁcant. If accurate predictions
that the regimen is not effective can be made early in a patient's
treatment, the treatment could be changed to another, potentially
more effective approach, thereby avoiding unnecessary treatmentrelated toxicities and providing a greater chance of achieving
pCR (13).
Assessing early treatment response with the goal of predicting
pCR remains a challenging clinical problem with no current
uniform approach. Because of their quantitative and noninvasive
nature, imaging-based biomarkers are attractive surrogate metrics
for response assessment. Several imaging-based metrics have been
investigated as biomarkers for predicting response in the neoadjuvant setting (14–22), with many efforts focusing on monitoring
changes in morphologic characteristics. However, morphologybased characteristics are downstream from the underlying treatment-induced biologic response, and are, therefore, indicative
only of late stage response. More recent efforts have focused on
using functional parameters available from quantitative magnetic

Quick Guide to Model Equations and Assumptions
Our modeling approach uses serial diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) data of tumor cellularity obtained
before and after the ﬁrst cycle of neoadjuvant therapy to generate spatial estimates of tumor cell proliferation/death in response to
therapy. Because of the timing of data acquisition, the estimated spatial proliferation term is based on measured changes in cell
density with treatment and therefore represents the net difference between cell growth and death. To separately estimate cell growth
and death rates independently, additional data would be required. We assume a constant antitumor effect in time during therapy,
and use our estimates of proliferation/death to run the model forward in time to predict the residual tumor burden at the conclusion
of therapy. DW-MRI data sets are ﬁt to Eq. A to return apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) values on a voxel-by-voxel basis:

P

ADC ¼

;

ðAÞ

where i is the direction of diffusion weighting, bi is the amount of diffusion weighting imparted to the sample, S0 denotes the signal
intensity in the absence of diffusion gradients, and Si is the signal intensity in the presence of the diffusion-sensitizing gradient. Using
Eq. B, the ADC data for voxels satisfying the dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) threshold criteria
of 80% enhancement (1) were transformed to an estimate of tumor cell number, N(x, t):

where u is the carrying capacity (i.e., the total number of tumor cells that ﬁt within a voxel), ADCw is the ADC of free water at 37 C (3
 103 mm2/s), ADC(x, t) is the ADC value at position (x,y) in image space, and ADCmin is the minimum ADC value measured
within the tumor for each patient, which corresponds to the voxel with the largest number of cells. The carrying capacity, u, was
calculated as the ratio of the imaging voxel volume to the assumed tumor cell volume, assuming spherical tumor cells with packing
density of 0.7405 (2) and a nominal tumor cell radius of 10 mm (tumor cell volume of 4189 mm3). Details of this approach are
provided in refs. 3 and 4.
The set of coupled, partial differential equations governing the tumor growth model is shown in Eqs. C–E:

Equation C models the spatiotemporal rate of change of tumor cell number as the sum of random cell diffusion and logistic
growth. The apparent cell diffusion term, D, is linked to surrounding tissue mechanics via Eq. D, where s vm is the von Mises stress, g is
an empirically derived coupling constant, and D0 is the diffusion of tumor cells in the absence of external stress (5). Eq. E deﬁnes
linear elastic, isotropic mechanical equilibrium subject to an external expansive force determined by changes in tumor cell number,
N(x, t), and a coupling constant l. This equation governs the response of the displacement vector, u, to tumor cell growth.
G represents shear modulus, an intrinsic mechanical property of breast and tumor tissue.
In this model, a growing tumor imparts an external force on the surrounding tissue, which induces tissue deformation. This
"mass effect" is the phenomenon by which a growing tumor displaces surrounding tissue. The overall deformation serves to
increase the total mechanical distortion energy of the tissue, which depends on the local tissue mechanical properties of the
immediately surrounding tissue (breast ﬁbroglandular tissue is typically reported to be twice as stiff as adipose tissue; ref. 6). As
tumors have been shown to be sensitive to their mechanical microenvironment, exhibiting reduced outward growth/expansion
in areas of high stress (7, 8), accumulated distortion energy serves to inhibit tumor invasiveness in our model through a
mechano-inhibitory reduction in the apparent tumor cell diffusion coefﬁcient, D. More details of the model implementation
are provided in ref. 9.
We acquire DW-MRI data at two time points, prior to initiating therapy and after one cycle of therapy, and use Eq. A to calculate
ADC values. These serial ADC maps are then transformed to estimate the tumor cell density distribution at each time point using
Eq. B. We then ﬁt these data to a model of tumor growth/response, Eqs. C–E, to yield estimates of tumor cell proliferation/death and
diffusion. The estimated parameters are then used in conjunction with the model to predict, by projecting the model forward in time,
the residual tumor burden at the conclusion of neoadjuvant therapy.
Major assumptions in our modeling approach include a reduction in dimensionality to two-dimensional analysis of centralslice MR data, constant proliferation/diffusion values throughout neoadjuvant therapy following initial parameter estimation,
and the nature of the mechanoinhibitory effect on tumor cell diffusivity. We return to these important assumptions in the

resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. For example, in the recent
multisite American College of Radiology Imaging Network
(ACRIN) 6657/Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your
Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular Analysis
(I-SPY TRIAL) (22), Hylton and colleagues examined traditional
clinical assessment combined with imaging morphologic measurements and contrast enhanced signal enhancement ratio
(SER). A four-predictor multivariate statistical model (clinical
size, longest diameter, volume, and SER) was shown to have
receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC)
of 0.73 for prediction of pCR at an early imaging time point, prior
to the second cycle of neoadjuvant therapy. A preliminary extension of this approach to combine quantitative region of interest
(ROI) and voxel-level analysis metrics from both dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, efﬂux
rate transfer constant (kep), and apparent diffusion coefﬁcient
(ADC), respectively, in a multivariate regression statistical analysis showed promise for achieving a higher predictive ability, with
AUC for pCR prediction of 0.87 at an early imaging time point,
after the ﬁrst cycle of neoadjuvant therapy (17). These studies
extract a single parameter or sets of parameters from quantitative
imaging data analysis and perform a statistical correlation to
clinical outcomes. However, the physiologic interpretation of
statistical combinations of extracted parameters as they pertain
to pCR or reduction in tumor burden is often largely unknown.
One promising way to maximize the impact of quantitative
noninvasive imaging data is to use mathematical models of tumor
growth driven by early time point imaging data in order to
determine and predict therapeutic response. Major advances in
mathematical modeling of tumor growth have occurred, where
sophisticated simulations can be generated that recapitulate many
cellular and bulk-level aspects of tumor growth and treatment
response (23–25). Unfortunately, many such models are fundamentally limited in that they cannot readily incorporate clinical
data and require knowledge of many different parameters of tumor
growth/status that are either impractical or impossible to measure
clinically (e.g., immune response, extracellular matrix status, genetic mutations, etc.). As complex, multiparametric models often
require an extensive array of model parameters either obtained
from literature values or empirically derived, they cannot be
practically applied to individual patients. Thus, the ﬁeld of mathematical oncology has been limited to more fundamental investigations and patient-speciﬁc predictive modeling has only seen
limited clinical application. There is a clear need to develop
clinically relevant oncological models that are amenable to available patient data and yet retain the most salient features of response
prediction (13).
We and others (4, 26–31) have recently suggested using quantitative in vivo imaging data to drive mathematical models of tumor
growth for predicting response. Following parameterization, these
models can then be projected forward in space and time to predict
eventual tumor distribution outcomes on a patient-speciﬁc basis.
Rather than taking a classical reductionist approach where each
appropriate physiologic constituent tumor-associated process is
described mathematically and coupled into a comprehensive, yet
increasingly complex representation, we have chosen to begin with
a more traditional spatiotemporal growth model that captures ﬁrstorder effects. In this approach, we use patient-speciﬁc quantitative
imaging data in two ways: (i) to ﬁt the model-associated parameters and (ii) to guide decisions whether to add complexity to the
model based not purely on the existence of more sophisticated

tumor-dynamic processes but rather how well incorporation can
match patient outcome as determined at the time of surgery. We
posit that systematically incorporating (additional) appropriate
complexity to maximize clinical prediction, rather than constructing from the myriad of reduced fundamental interactions, has
considerable merit for the ultimate realization of practical mathematical oncology in the clinical setting.
Recently, we have developed and shown preliminary results for
a biomechanical modeling framework where tumor response is
parameterized using data from both before and after the ﬁrst cycle
of neoadjuvant therapy and the model is driven forward in time to
predict tumor burden at the time of surgery (9). The model is
based on the standard reaction–diffusion equation of tumor
growth/response, with terms to describe tumor cell diffusion and
proliferation; in our formulation, the model is initialized and
constrained using the serial imaging data. We extend this basic
macroscopic tumor model to incorporate a mechano-inhibitory
effect of surrounding tissue stroma on tumor cell diffusivity/
motility. In this study, we build upon the previous efforts and
apply patient-speciﬁc predictive modeling, constrained by quantitative imaging data, to a group of patients exhibiting a varying
degree of response to therapy. We adopt a patient-scale spatiotemporal tumor growth model framework and allow readily
available clinical imaging data to guide the determination of
model parameters in a best-ﬁt sense. The goal of this study is to
determine if a patient-speciﬁc mechanically coupled reaction–
diffusion model of tumor response to therapy can be used as a
predictive indicator of pCR.

Materials and Methods
Subject description
An existing database of patients with breast cancer receiving
quantitative MRI before (t1), after one cycle (t2), and at the
conclusion (t3) of neoadjuvant therapy from a previous study
(17) was utilized for this retrospective analysis. Brieﬂy, 33 patients
with stage II/III breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant therapy as a component of their clinical care were selected for this
study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: no prior systemic therapies for breast cancer and histologically documented invasive
carcinoma of the breast with a sufﬁcient risk of recurrence, based
on pretreatment clinical parameters of size, grade, age, and nodal
status, to warrant the use of neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant
therapy was administered at the discretion of the treating medical
oncologist based on pretreatment clinical parameters.
Tumor type was classiﬁed based on expression status for estrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal
growth factor 2 (HER2) and categorized as ER and/or PR positive,
HER2 positive, or triple-negative (ER, PR, and HER2 negative);
see Table 1. Most patients with HER2 positive tumors received
paclitaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab every 3 weeks for six
cycles. Most patients with ER and/or PR positive tumors received
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks for four cycles
followed by 12 weekly cycles of paclitaxel. Most patients with
triple-negative tumors participated in an ongoing clinical trial and
received weekly cisplatin and paclitaxel with or without everolimus
for 12 weeks. Response status was determined at the time of surgery
by a pathologist as either pCR, which is deﬁned as no residual
viable tumor on histologic analysis of the breast or nodes at the
completion of neoadjuvant therapy, or non-pCR, which designates
any residual invasive tumor on histologic analysis in breast or

and spectrally selective adiabatic inversion recovery fat saturation
were implemented to reduce image artifacts. Subjects were breathing freely with no gating applied. The DW-MRIs consisted of
12 sagittal slices with slice thickness of 5 mm (no slice gap),
TR ¼ 3080 ms, TE ¼ "shortest" (41 or 60 ms), D ¼ 19.8 or 29 ms,
and d ¼ 10.7 or 21 ms, NSA ¼ 10. The total scan time for THRIVE,
DCE-MRI, and DW-MRI data was approximately 2.7, 6.7, and 4.7
minutes, respectively.

Data analysis
A mechanically coupled reaction diffusion model of tumor
response to therapy that used the MRI data obtained at time points
t1 and t2 was used to predict tumor burden at the conclusion of
neoadjuvant therapy. Although a brief description follows, the
interested reader is referred to Weis and colleagues for details of the
modeling methodology (9). Brieﬂy, THRIVE, DCE-MRI, and DWMRI data were longitudinally coregistered (32) across all time
points. Central-slice images through the midpoint of the tumor
were extracted from MRI volumes for further analysis. DCE-MRI
data were used to deﬁne a tumor region-of-interest for voxels
satisfying 80% signal enhancement threshold (9) between the
precontrast images (i.e., the average signal intensity from DCEMRI time points 1–3) and the postcontrast images (i.e., the average
signal intensity from DCE-MRI time points 4–25). Voxels that
showed a signal intensity increase more than the 80% threshold
between the pre- and postcontrast data were deﬁned as tumor (1).
ADC maps were calculated from DW-MRI datasets using Eq. A

and transformed to estimates of tumor cell number using Eq. B
(3, 4). A two-dimensional, mechanically coupled reaction diffusion tumor model, Eqs. C–E, was used to describe tumor cell
logistic growth/decay and diffusion based on the central slice of the
MR data. This model incorporates a tumor growth "mass effect"
where accumulated mechanical distortion energy has an inhibitory
effect on tumor cell invasiveness (5). Tumor cellularity at baseline
(t1) and after one cycle of neoadjuvant therapy (t2) was used to
estimate the spatially varying proliferation rates and a global tumor
cell diffusion parameter by a conjugate-gradient nonlinear optimization. Following parameter ﬁtting, the model was projected
forward in time (using the estimated proliferation and tumor
cell diffusion parameters) to the ﬁnal time point at the conclusion
of neoadjuvant therapy (t3), and the tumor cellularity was calculated as a model prediction. A schematic of the model parameter
estimation and prediction framework is shown in Fig. 1. In
addition, the cellularity maps for each patient at each time point
for both the experimentally observed (t1 and t2) and model
predicted (t3) cellularity data were summed to yield an estimate
of the total tumor cellularity. To eliminate volumetric bias, these
numbers are expressed as a percent change relative to a reference
time point; for example, a percent change in cellularity from t1 to t2
is deﬁned as 100(t2  t1)/t1.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis between non-pCR and pCR patient groups
for percent changes in each analysis metric was performed using
the Wilcoxon test. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated
for prediction of pCR for both the mechanically coupled model
and a standard reaction–diffusion model. ROC curves were analyzed and area under the curve (AUC) and 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CI) were generated for each model. The optimal cutoff
was selected utilizing the Youden index, which maximizes the
difference between the true positive rate and the false positive rate
(33). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software).

Results
Clinical patient data
Thirty-three patients (median age, 46; range, 28–67) completed
scanning at t1 and at t2. The median time between t1 and t2 was 14
days (range, 7–29 days). Table 1 summarizes the salient features
of the patient data set, including their tumor type and pathologic
response. After neoadjuvant therapy, 12 of 33 patients (36%)
were deﬁned as having achieved pCR.
Representative imaging and modeling data
Imaging data and model predictions for tumors from two
representative patients are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2 displays
data from a patient that achieved pCR at the conclusion of
neoadjuvant therapy that was scanned before, after the ﬁrst cycle,
and at the conclusion of neoadjuvant therapy in the form of
anatomical images (Fig. 2A–C), ADC (from DW-MRI) values
superimposed on the averaged postcontrast images (Fig. 2D–
F), and the estimated cellularity (using Eq. B) as a fraction of the
carrying capacity (Fig. 2G–I). The mechanically coupled reaction–
diffusion model is used to reconstruct parameter estimates of
global diffusion and spatial proliferation rate (Fig. 2J) based on
observed cellularity data from the baseline and post-one cycle

the estimated parameters and observed cellularity data in order to

from imaging and pathology of complete response to therapy.
Qualitatively, the estimated cellularity map is shown to exhibit a
signiﬁcant trend of decrease between t1 and t2. The prediction of
the mechanically coupled reaction–diffusion model is seen to
continue the trend of decreasing cellularity at t3, with a prediction
of near complete response. Figure 3 displays similar data for a

Similarly, the estimated tumor cellularity based on ADC values

and poor speciﬁcity of 47%.
Using image-based mathematical modeling in order to predict
tumor response to therapy is seen to improve pCR predictive
performance. Reaction–diffusion model predictions of tumor
cellularity at the conclusion of neoadjuvant therapy, expressed
as a percent change from cellularity after one cycle of neoadjuvant
therapy, exhibit an AUC, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity of 0.75%,
100%, and 55%, respectively. Here, model predictions are
expressed as a percent change to eliminate volumetric bias from
prediction results. Incorporating mechanical coupling into the
reaction–diffusion model signiﬁcantly improves pCR predictive
performance, achieving an ROC AUC, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity
of 0.87%, 92%, and 84%, respectively.

Discussion
We previously introduced a novel mathematical framework
for predictive modeling that is centered on integrating quantitative in vivo imaging data with biomechanical models of tumor
growth (9). This approach represents a signiﬁcant departure from
existing paradigms in mathematical oncology modeling by using
patient-speciﬁc data to parameterize a model that can then be
used to make a prediction at a future time point that can then be
checked directly against patient response. In this work, we retrospectively apply this framework to a database of patients exhibiting varying degrees of responsiveness to neoadjuvant therapy. We
compared model predictions of responsiveness to pathologic
response assessment at the time of surgery. Our results demonstrate a signiﬁcant predictive ability of our mechanics coupled
modeling approach in identifying patients that would go on to
achieve pCR, as indicated by a strong AUC of 0.87. Our mechanics
coupled reaction–diffusion modeling approach signiﬁcantly outperformed other, commonly used metrics, including analysis of
tumor longest dimension (i.e., RECIST), early-cycle changes in
DW-MRI (used as empirical input data to the models), and
standard reaction–diffusion predictive modeling. Compared with
the standard reaction–diffusion model, the mechanically coupled
model exhibits signiﬁcantly improved prediction speciﬁcity,
reﬂected by improved prediction of true non-pCR patients
(55% vs. 84%, respectively). Further analysis of the patients for
which mechanically coupled modeling improved predictability
over standard modeling (data not shown), failed to reveal correlations with any other known factor (including breast density,
patient age, and breast cancer subtype, among others).
Our results also conﬁrm previous reports of the use of early
cycle DW-MRI ADC data alone in predicting neoadjuvant therapy
response (34–39). Trends of decreasing/increasing cellularity are

4704 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

clearly visible between the observed cellularity before and after the
ﬁrst cycle of therapy, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, with predictive
AUC of 0.73. However, analysis of these data is seen to exhibit
limited speciﬁcity, as has been previously demonstrated (35, 40).
The results from this study are promising, but we recognize that
there are several limitations in our current approach. First, we
estimate the key model parameters (i.e., proliferation and tumor
cell diffusion) from data obtained before and after the ﬁrst cycle of
neoadjuvant therapy; this is an admittedly (temporally) sparse set
of measurements for attempting to capture the dynamics through
a model ﬁtting procedure. In addition, we have assumed that
reconstructed model parameters do not vary in time; this is
essentially equivalent to assuming a constant antitumor effect
during neoadjuvant therapy treatment and this is clearly a simpliﬁcation of the response of tumor cells to neoadjuvant therapy.
True response undoubtedly exhibits strong nonlinear temporal
response to therapy; indeed, the evolution of a resistant phenotype in the presence of continued chemotherapeutic administration speaks directly to a nonlinear effect that is not currently taken
into account in our approach. However, it is clinically infeasible to
acquire sufﬁcient imaging time points throughout the course of
therapy to accurately predict the temporal changes in proliferation
rates and tumor cell diffusion with the current model. We are
currently exploring acquisition of one additional early imaging
time point, collected after two cycles of therapy, in order to better
understand the temporal evolution of parameters and more
accurate prediction of response.
A second limitation, as also noted in Li and colleagues (17), is
the variation in the breast cancer subtype, therapeutic regimen
(including the speciﬁc therapeutic agent and dosing frequency),
and number of days elapsed between imaging time points, t1 and
t2. Thus, it is possible that the modeling approach could be
inﬂuenced by the underlying dynamics and biology of speciﬁc
breast cancer subtypes as well as the particular therapy regimen
utilized. This source of uncertainty due to patient-speciﬁc biologic
variability is particularly difﬁcult to control, due to the nature of
clinical research data acquisition constraints. It will be important,
as a greater number of patients are analyzed with this methodology, to statistically analyze the model relative to cancer subtype,
therapeutic regimen, and imaging time point delay to determine
these effects. In addition, future work toward model validation in
preclinical and in vitro systems will facilitate greater experimental
control and provide further understanding toward model robustness in the presence of such biological variability. Of course, the
encouraging preliminary results achieved with our modeling
approach in spite of this variability points to the importance,
and potential generalizability, of using models based on patientspeciﬁc information.
Another limitation is that our current approach utilizes centralslice MR data to initialize and constrain two-dimensional mathematical models, rather than using full image volumes and threedimensional models. We do note, however, that we are utilizing

somewhat thick slices, 5 mm, due to the spatio-temporal acquisition requirements of the trial for which the MRI data were
originally acquired. Extension of our approach to three-dimensional analysis is straightforward, and we would expect an
enhanced predictive capability through the use of additional
volumetric data. However, the current computational demands
for iterative reconstruction of volumetric parameter maps

signiﬁcantly limit the feasibility of extending our approach to
three-dimensional analysis for an entire patient database at this
time. Currently, efforts are underway to reﬁne our approach
by exploring signiﬁcant computational speed enhancements
though the use of high-performance computing cluster and/or
graphics processing unit processing in addition to algorithmic
enhancements.

Weis et al.

The mechanically coupled reaction diffusion model adds two
additional degrees of freedom to each node in the ﬁnite element
mesh (in addition to the existing degree of freedom for tumor cell
number) due to the need for calculation of a displacement
solution. This added complexity increases the computation time
for the forward model by approximately 40%, without parallelization of matrix assembly and/or matrix inversion. In addition,
the impact on total wall-clock time is relatively limited as the
entire mechanically coupled reaction diffusion model prediction
approach typically requires only 1 to 2 hours for each patient.
At present, our mechanics coupled approach relies on the use of
literature values for the elastic properties of the breast (9). In
addition, our approach currently ignores other important biologic
factors beyond simple growth and mechanoinhibitory diffusion.
Other ongoing efforts are designed to address these limitations
through incorporation of additional quantitative patient-speciﬁc
imaging methodologies to inform more complex models (13).
Given these limitations, we note that our approach compares
very favorably, with similar AUC, to previous multimodal statistical regression analysis of this same patient population in previous work that combines ROI and voxel-level DW-MRI and DCEMRI analysis (17). Importantly, our approach currently includes
data from only one quantitative imaging source, DW-MRI. Contrast-enhanced MRI data are used in this work only to identify
tumor ROI, with no sensitivity to pharmacokinetic parameters ﬁt
from dynamic DCE-MRI data. It is therefore very encouraging that
our model-based analysis framework, based on unimodal and
two-dimensional central-slice input data, achieves similar predictive results to multimodal full-volume analysis.
In summary, we have demonstrated a model-based analysis
method that provides predictions of therapeutic response using
patient-speciﬁc early time point imaging data within the course of
therapy. The framework provides good agreement with pathologic response observations as demonstrated by a strong predictive ability. The results suggest that an imaging-driven biophysically constrained modeling approach that combines reaction–
diffusion with mechanical effects is a predictive indicator of
response to therapy. Future work will seek to further enhance
the predictive capacity of our approach by expanding the math-

ematical model of tumor response to include model terms that
can be populated with other sources of quantitative patientspeciﬁc noninvasive imaging, including DCE-MRI, ﬂudeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and magnetic
resonance elastography (MRE).
