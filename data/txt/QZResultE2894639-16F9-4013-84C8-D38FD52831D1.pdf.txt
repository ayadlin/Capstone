ABSTRACT
Recent development of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMs) for
pancreatic cancer (PC) that recapitulates human disease progression has helped to
identify new strategies to delay/inhibit PC development. We first found that expression
of the pancreatic tumor-initiating/cancer stem cells (CSC) marker DclK1 occurs in
early stage PC and in both early and late pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)
and that it increases as disease progresses in GEM and also in human PC. Genomewide next generation sequencing of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from
GEM mice revealed significantly increased DclK1 along with inflammatory genes.
Genetic ablation of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) decreased DclK1 in GEM. Induction of
inflammation/pancreatitis with cerulein in GEM mice increased DclK1, and the novel
dual COX/5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor licofelone reduced it. Dietary licofelone
significantly inhibited the incidence of PDAC and carcinoma in situ with significant
inhibition of pancreatic CSCs. Licofelone suppressed pancreatic tumor COX-2 and
5-LOX activities and modulated miRNAs characteristic of CSC and inflammation in
correlation with PDAC inhibition. These results offer a preclinical proof of concept to
target the inflammation initiation to inhibit cancer stem cells early for improving the
treatment of pancreatic cancers, with immediate clinical implications for repositioning
dual COX/5-LOX inhibitors in human trials for high risk patients.

treatment marginally increases the survival by about
few weeks. Recent studies demonstrate that pre-invasive
precursors progress slowly over many years to decades
to development of invasive PCs [1–3]. Thus, there is a
time frame of several years for effective intervention
strategies. Interventions that can delay or inhibit the
progression of precursor lesions to PC should drastically
improve the overall survival rate. Premalignant pancreatic

intra-epithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions are the most
common precursors to invasive PDAC, rendering
them promising targets for intervention, especially in
the high-risk population [4]. Human PDAC (> 90%)
often is characterized by activating mutations in KRAS
oncogenes [5, 6]. Recently, several genetically engineered
mouse models (GEMs) of PC have been developed that
recapitulate human disease progression. Mice harboring
a conditional K-ras mutant allele (LSL-Kras-G12D/+) in
combination with a pancreas-specific Cre recombinase
transgene (PdxCre/+ or p48Cre/+) develop a full range of
PanIN lesions in the pancreas before succumbing to
invasive PDAC and other tumors at late ages [3, 7]. It
also was demonstrated recently that the KrasG12Ddependent mouse model of PDAC that accurately mimics
the therapeutic response of human PDAC offers the
opportunity to develop novel treatments [3, 9–11]. We
have shown that these GEM are excellent models for
understanding PanIN progression and are useful for drug
and other intervention studies [3, 12–18].
Inflammation is evident at the earliest stages of
cancer progression and is capable of fostering growth and
progression of early lesions to PDAC and into metastatic
cancers. Chronic pancreatitis is considered to be a risk
factor for pancreatic tumor growth [19, 20]. Initiation of
pancreatic lesions and their progression to PDAC and further
metastatic invasion also are associated with inflammation.
Among various inflammatory modulators, eicosanoidderived molecules such as prostaglandin (PG) E2 (PGE2)
and leukotrienes (LTs) have been shown to modulate tumor
progression; and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents that block PGE2 has been shown to inhibit tumor
growth [15, 21–23]. Thus, preclinical and clinical data
underscore the importance of arachidonic acid metabolismrelated inflammatory responses in pancreatic tumorigenesis.
Several
lines
of
evidence
show
that
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)
are over-expressed significantly in cancers. Preclinical
studies show that COX-2 inhibitors may inhibit pancreatic
cancer both in vitro and in vivo; however, those studies
have not been translated for clinical usage [15, 21, 24].
Morevover, use of celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, in
the prevention of adenomatous polyps was associated
with a significant increase in risk of cardiovascular
(CV) events  [25]. In another study, the relative risk
of CV  events  with the use of celecoxib as compared
with placebo was 1.30 [26]. It is widely accepted that
selectively blocking COX-2 will shift arachidonic acid
metabolism towards the 5-LOX pathway, overproducing
leukotrienes and leading to increased prothrombotic
effects [25, 27–30]. Cancer Stem cell (CSC) populations
have been identified in a variety of human cancer types and
recent evidence suggests that the COX-2 metabolite PGE2
enhances stemness and proliferation of CSCs [31, 32]. In
pancreatic carcinogenesis, increased inflammation and
tumor cell stemness not only contribute to progression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of tumor growth and invasion, but also to resistance to
chemotherapy. Thus, in this study we evaluated the
potential role of inflammation on CSC markers during PC
progression and the use of the novel anti-inflammatory
dual COX/5-LOX inhibitor licofelone in PC arising de
novo in GEMs.

RESULTS
Activation of inflammation and CSCs during
progression of pancreatic cancer
p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice were analyzed for
the expression of COX-2, 5-LOX and DclK1 (Fig. 1,
Supplementary Fig. 1). Inflammation is the first step during
the initiation and progression of PC. As the mice aged
from 2 to 6 to 10 months, along with progression of PanIN
lesions and carcinoma, we observed a significant increase
in the inflammatory COX-2 along with proliferating cells
(Fig. 1A-1C, Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, DclK1 was
expressed at the early stage, i.e., in 2 month-old GEM, and
was seen in all of the pancreatic precursor lesions (PanIN1,
PanIN2 and PanIN3) (Fig. 1D). DclK1 expression increased
linearly as the disease progressed to PDAC (Fig. 1E-1G).
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of normal pancreas
and ductal adenocarcinoma revealed that the mRNAs of
COX-2, 5-LOX and DclK1 were increased significantly (up
to 53-fold; p < 0.01–0.001) in the PDAC (Fig. 1H). Also,
we found high expression of DclK1 and COX-2 in human
PDAC (Fig. 1I & 1J). These results strongly indicate that
inflammation and stem cell regulation occur at the initial
stages of PC and progress simultaneously as the diseases
lead to the PDAC stage.

Genetic ablation of COX-2 inhibits formation of
DclK1 cells early during tumorigenesis in GEM
To determine whether inflammation is a key
factor driving tumorigenesis through CSCs, we used the
KrasG12D GEM (LSLKras/Ela-CreERT mice) alone or
crossed with COX2 conditional knockout mice (COXKO/
LSL-Kras/Ela-CreERT) to study the effect of COX-2
ablation on DclK1. We observed a moderate inhibition
of DclK1 upon deletion of COX-2 in four week-old
GEM  mice (Fig. 2A-2B). It is well known that when
COX-2 is inhibited, a shift in arachidonic acid metabolism
occurs, leading to 5-LOX proinflammatory activities.
Hence further studies using a dual COX-5-LOX model is
warranted to evaluate the role of this shift in inflammatory
mediators on DclK1 cells.

the DclK1  increase in p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ GEM
(Supplementary Fig. 2A-2C). Pancreas weights in the
p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ GEM were increased with the
inflammatory conditions and significantly reduced upon
licofelone treatment (Fig. 2C-2D). Histological analysis
showed 100% penetrance of pancreatic precursor
PanIN lesions in the GEM (Fig. 2E). The numbers of
PanIN  1,  PanIN 2, and PanIN 3 lesions in the GEM
were (means ± SE): 248 ±  39, 98 ± 16, and 75  ± 14,

respectively; in the licofelone treated GEM, PanIN  1,
PanIN 2, and PanIN 3 numbers were 96 ± 38, 50 ± 15 and
32 ± 12, respectively (Fig. 2E). The number of PanIN 3
lesions or carcinoma in situ was decreased by ~3-fold
in the licofelone-treated mice (Fig. 2E). A significant
decrease in the number of PanIN 1 and PanIN 2 lesions
also was observed in pancreas of licofelone treated GEM.
We observed mild pancreatitis in the licofelonetreated mice via histopathology whereas in the untreated
GEM, pancreatitis was moderate to severe (Fig. 2F).

treatment group whereas up to 50% was found in the
untreated mice (p < 0.01, Fig. 2G). Significantly decreased
inflammatory cell infiltration and stromal fibrosis were
observed in the licofelone treated mice (Fig. 2H, 2I). More
than a two-fold increase in hyperplasia of ductules was
noticed in the pancreata of untreated mice compared with
those of licofelone treated mice (Fig. 2J). Supplementary
Table 1. shows the scoring patterns for cerulein treated
mice. However, no pancreatitis was seen in the pancreata

of either untreated or licofelone-treated mice not treated
with cerulein.
A marked increase in number of DclK1 cells
was observed in the cerulean-induced inflammation
GEM mice (~3 months old) (means ± SE; 48 ± 13),
comparable to the number of DclK1 cells in non-cerulein
treated mice at 6 months of age. Licofelone treatment
inhibited DclK1 cells, inflammation and proliferation
significantly (Fig. 3).

consecutive days. Licofelone (500 ppm) was fed to a group of mice starting one day before cerulein injection to one day after the last
cerulein injection. One day after cerulein injection, all mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and necropsied. Pancreata were collected
from all groups, weighed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed with
paraffin-embedded and micro-sectioned pancreatic tissues as described in the Methods section. A significantly decreased expression of
DclK1, COX-2, 5-LOX, PCNA and Ki67 was seen in licofelone-treated GEM. A significantly reduced number of DclK1 positive cells and
proliferation index was seen in the licofelone-treated GEM compared with untreated mice.

Licofelone modulates arachidonic
acid metabolism

whereas the pancreas (pancreatic tumor) of transgenic
mice at 44 weeks of age weighs about 1.33  g, almost
five-fold more (Fig. 4D). We  examined PDAC
development (Supplementary Fig. 2D-2E) and treatment
effects of licofelone on the p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice.
Mice that were euthanized before termination (due to
sickness) or found dead constituted ~20% (7 of 34 mice)
in the control group and ~7% (2 of 28 mice) and ~8%
(2 of 24 mice) in 250 ppm and 500 ppm licofelone
treatment groups, respectively (Fig. 4E). All wild type
and transgenic mice fed control or licofelone diets had
steady body weight gains (Supplementary Fig. 2F-2G). At
44 weeks of age, all mice were euthanized and evaluated
for pancreatic weights (Fig. 4F-4G). None of the animals
fed experimental diets exhibited any observable toxicity
or any gross morphologic changes in liver, spleen, kidney
or lung despite notable and significant differences in
the pancreas weights. Licofelone treatment reduced the
pancreas weights significantly in comparison with those of
untreated transgenic mice (Fig. 4F-4G). Pancreas weights
in the high dose licofelone group were almost equal to
those of the wild type mice in both genders (Fig.  4F).
We  observed a 63–77% reduction in the pancreatic
tumor weights in the treatment groups compared with the
untreated control group (Fig. 4F-4G).

Licofelone exerts its effects by modulating COX2- and 5-LOX-generated arachidonic acid metabolites. We
measured total COX and 5-LOX activity by radiometric
HPLC. A significant decrease was seen in total COX and
5-LOX metabolites in the pancreatic tumor tissue from
mice treated with 250 and 500 ppm licofelone. As shown
in Fig. 5G & 5H, mean total PG and thromboxane B2
(TXB2) generation in pancreas of control mice versus mice
fed 250 or 500 ppm licofelone were 5.95 versus 4.22 and
3.51 pmoles/min; and 5-HETE was 35.68 versus 10.65
and 3.12 pmoles/min, respectively. Total COX and 5-LOX
activities were reduced significantly in pancreatic tumor
tissues from low and high dose licofelone-treated mice
compared with tumors from control mice. Total COX was
inhibited by 29.19% (P < 0.001) and 41% (P < 0.0001),
and 5-LOX was inhibited by 70% (p < 0.0001) and
91% (p < 0.0001), respectively, with the low and high
licofelone doses (Fig. 5G-5H). We also have noticed a
significant decrease in β-catenin in both treatment groups
(Supplementary Fig. 3A).

Fig. 6A and 6B summarize the effects of licofelone
on tumor cell proliferation as measured by PCNA
overexpression. Quantification of PCNA staining showed
75 ± 1.34 (mean ± SEM) PCNA-positive cells in pancreas
from untreated, as compared with 23 ± 1.54 and 6 ± 1.25
PCNA-positive cells in low and high dose licofelonetreated mice, accounting for a decrease in the proliferation
index of approximately 69% and 92% (P < 0.0001),
respectively (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6C and 6D summarize the
effects of licofelone on tumor cell apoptosis. Qualitative
microscopic examination showed a substantial increase
in TUNEL-positive cells in the pancreatic tumor tissue
of mice treated with licofelone. Quantification of
TUNEL-positive cells from pancreas of control dietfed mice showed 18 ± 1.8 (mean ± SEM) as compared
with 38 ± 1.63 and 62 ± 1.33 TUNEL-positive cells in
pancreatic tumor tissue from licofelone-treated mice,
accounting for an increase in the apoptotic index of more
than 52% and 71% (P > 0.0001), respectively (Fig. 6D).
In agreement with the apoptosis results, we observed a
significant increase in Caspase-3, p21 and p53 mRNA
expression (Fig. 6E-6G) and a decrease β-catenin in the
treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 3A).

Histological analysis revealed that 82% (14/17)
of the untreated male and 65% (11/17) of untreated
female  mice had PDAC, whereas 3/13 male and 1/15
female mice treated with 250 ppm licofelone and only
1/13  male and 1/11 female mice treated with 500  ppm
showed evidence of PDAC (Fig. 4H-4I). All the
p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice with or without licofelone
developed PanIN lesions. We observed 185 PanIN  1,
158 PanIN 2 and 158 PanIN 3 lesions in untreated males
and 185 PanIN1, 181 PanIN2 and 238 PanIN 3 lesions
in untreated females (Fig. ­5A-5B). However, licofelone
treatment caused a significant decrease in the development
of PanIN 2 lesions and carcinoma in situ (PanIN 3 lesions)
(Fig.  5A-5B). We  then examined the pancreas for the
spread of carcinoma. An average of 30.2% of untreated
male mouse pancreas was occupied by PDAC. Pancreas
from male mice treated with licofelone at 250  and
500 ppm showed carcinoma spread of only 12 and 1.3%
or inhibition of 72 and 90%, respectively (Fig. 5C).
The  female mice treated with both doses of licofelone
showed more than 96% inhibition of carcinoma spread
(Fig. 5D). The normal-appearing pancreas of control mice
comprised only 4% and 5% of the total pancreatic tissues
in the males and females, respectively. After licofelone
treatment, normal-appearing pancreatic tissue constituted
a significantly higher percentage of the pancreas in both
genders (Fig. 5E-5F).

show the potential of licofelone to delay progression of
pancreatic lesions to carcinoma via multiple effects.

results are consistent with alteration by licofelone of

we induced inflammatory changes in the pancreas of
GEM with cerulean. We observed significantly enhanced
pancreatitis along with increased PanIN lesions and
increased DclK1 in cerulean-treated GEM. Licofelone
dramatically inhibited inflammation, proliferation,
thereby pancreatitis as well as PanIN lesions and DclK1
expression (Fig. 2C-2K & 3). These data support the
conclusion that inflammation plays a role in regulating
DclK1. Among dual COX/LOX inhibitors, licofelone is in
advanced phase of clinical trials as an anti-inflammatory
drug [38], and its safety and efficacy, in comparison with
the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such
as naproxen and rofecoxib, have been well documented
[30, 39, 40].
Given these results and as rationalized in
introduction, simultaneously targeting COX and 5-LOX
pathways early during inflammation may be an effective
way to suppress pancreatic tumor progression without
unwanted cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects.
In our long term in vivo efficacy study, we demonstrated
that licofelone can target arachidonic acid metabolites
derived from COX-2 and 5-LOX, cancer stem cell
markers (DclK1, CD133, CD44 and Lgr5) and specific
miRNAs and their target genes and can potently inhibit
PanIN progression to PDAC without any unwanted sideeffects. We found that licofelone inhibits COX-2 and
5-LOX activities, thus blocking production of tumorigenic
mediators like PGE2. Licofelone-fed mice showed
dramatic inhibition of PDAC incidence in both males
and females. Development of carcinoma in situ (PanIN 3
lesions) was blocked by 35–56%. The most striking
finding was that carcinoma spread was inhibited by
> 95% in treatment groups, with a significant decrease in
mortality of the mice. These results are consistent with our
earlier studies on licofelone in colon cancer [30]. There
are limited reports on evaluation of COX-2 inhibitors and
no reports on dual COX/5-LOX inhibitiors in PC using
a GEM model. For example, Funahasi et al. reported
that the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide delays the
progression of PC precursor lesions in the KrasG12D
mouse model [21].
Of note, licofelone effects on pancreatic tumor
weights correlated very well with effects on PDAC
incidence, carcinoma in situ development and invasiveness
of cancer. Previous investigations of our group and others
revealed anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of licofelone
on colon cancer [30, 41]. Our results here clearly indicate
that licofelone effectively suppressed the growth and
progression of PC in GEM. We propose that the synergism
obtained due to simultaneous inhibition of COX and 5-LOX
at early stages might be an underlying mechanism for the
enhanced antitumor effects [30]. However, further studies
are warranted to establish cause and effect.
In the present study, licofelone significantly
suppressed increases in DclK1 along with other CSC
markers (Lgr5, CD133 and CD44) in correlation with its

DISCUSSION
Treatment of PC has been a big unmet challenge.
The aim of this study was to shed light on the role of
inflammation in DclK-1-positive CSCs and pancreatic
adenocarcinoma and to evaluate the pharmacologic
effects of licofelone on PC. The existence and the levels
of CSCs have profound implications for cancer treatment
due to the likelihood that eradication of CSCs is the
critical determinant in achieving ultimate cure [34, 35].
We have demonstrated that DclK-1 (DCAMKL-1), is a
novel putative pancreatic stem cell marker and identified
DclK-1 as potent target for pancreatic tumor eradication.
Our laboratory and others have shown overexpression of
the markers DclK-1, CD-44 and CD-133, representing
cancer stemness, in PC [17, 34–36]. DCLK1 mark
morphologically distinct and functionally unique
population of pancreatic cancer-initiating cells. Cells
that expressed DCLK1 expressed high levels of ATAT1,
HES1, HEY1, IGF1R, ABL1, and manipulation of these
pathways in PDAC cell lines inhibited their clonogenic
potential [37]. Many PC treatment strategies result in
tumor shrinkage but often fail to prevent recurrence
due to their ineffectiveness against CSCs. Thus, novel
prevention and treatment strategies that specifically target
the CSC population may be more effective in obliterating
this deadly disease. In this study, we determined whether
inflammation plays a role in over-expression of DclK1
and whether the anti-inflammatory agent licofelone
contributes to PC inhibition by modulating CSC markers.
We found Inflammation in the early stages of pancreatic
tumor progression (Supplementary Fig. 1) and we also
observed DclK1 expression as early as 2 months of age
in the PDAC GEM. DclK1 was expressed in both low
grade and high grade PanIN lesions (PanIN 1, -2, -3).
Both DclK1 and COX-2 expression was high in the human
PDAC (Fig. 1I & 1J). These results suggest that CSCs get
activated at an early stage along with inflammation and
progresses in a linear way as the disease progresses. These
results were corroborated with next generation sequencing
of pancreas from wild type and GEM mice, which
showed that DclK1, COX-2 and 5-LOX were increased
significantly in tumors (Fig. 1).
Genetic ablation of COX-2 to decrease inflammation
in GEM mice at 4 weeks of age led to a decrease in the
DclK1 expression (Fig. 2A-2B). Previous reports have
shown that decrease in COX-2 inhibits PC [15, 21]. To
further demonstrate the role of inflammation on DclK1,

inhibition of tumor progression, suggesting that licofelone
may kill CSCs. Drugs like metformin have been shown
to target specifically cancer stem cells, thereby showing
greater effects in blocking pancreatic and breast tumor
growth and prolonging remissions [17, 36, 42]. Real time
PCR analysis showed deregulation of several miRNAs
with oncogenic and tumor suppressor activities in the
untreated pancreatic tumors. The link between aberrant
miRNA expression and PC development suggests that
miRNAs could be potential targets for chemopreventive
and chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study, we
showed that the expression of several miRNAs is altered
during the development of PC and that licofelone reverses
the altered expression of the majority of these miRNAs
with up-regulation of miR-21, miR-222, Let-7, miR-125,
miR-142 and down-regulation of miR-1, miR-122 and
miR-148. In recent years, researchers have attempted to
alter the expression of miRNAs for inhibition of cancer
growth using several agents [43]. All of the miRNAs we
studied are aberrantly expressed in human cancers. For
example, Lee EJ 2007 et al. [44] showed that the miRNAs
miR155, miR21, miR222, Let7, miR376a, miR301,
miR100, miR125, miR142 and others are overexpressed
significantly in human PC. Researchers also have found
that miR-1 is down-regulated in several types of cancers
[45–48] and that it acts as a tumor suppressor. MicroRNA148a is down-regulated in human PDAC and regulates
cell survival by targeting CDC25B [49]. Licofelone
dramatically down-regulated the majority of miRNAs
overexpressed in association with pancreatic tumor
progression and upregulated miR1, miR122 and miR158
by many fold including those that regulate inflammation
and CSCs. These results clearly demonstrate the ability of
licofelone to regulate inflammation, CSCs and miRNAs in
correlation with its inhibition of PC progression.

Cerulein-induced inflammation in GEM mice
After genotyping, pancreatitis was induced by inject­
ing cerulein intraperitoneally (i.p.) in twelve-week-old
p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice (n = 6/group) with or without
licofelone according to the published method with
modification [50]. Briefly, all of the mice were injected
with 5 μg/mice of cerulein every day for six consecutive
days. Licofelone (500 ppm) was fed to a group of mice
starting one day before cerulein injection to one day
after the last cerulein injection. One day after cerulein
injection, all mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation
and necropsied. Pancreata were collected from all groups,
weighed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for further
analysis. Pancreata required for histopathology (to evaluate
pancreatitis and PanINs) and immunohistochemistry
(IHC) for evaluation of various molecular markers were
fixed (head to tail) in 10% neutral-buffered formalin as
previously described [12–18].

Tissue processing and histological analysis of
pancreatitis and PanIN lesions
After euthanzing the mice, pancreata and other
key organs (including liver, spleen, kidney, lung) were
collected and weighed. Tissues were fixed in 10%
formalin for 24 h and routinely processed and embedded
in paraffin. Pancreatitis was analyzed and graded using a
semi-quantitative scoring system according to established
criteria in the literature by a pathologist blinded to the
treatment group. Briefly, the pancreatitis index was
expressed as a sum of scores on severity of pancreatitis,
loss of acini, extent of inflammatory cell infiltration and
stromal fibrosis as per earlier studies [33, 50]. To quantify
the progression of PanIN lesions, the total number of
ductal lesions and their grades were determined [12–18].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse model, diet and handling
All animal research was performed under the
auspices of animal protocols approved by the University of
Oklahoma Health Sciences Center institutional animal care
and use committee. Animals were housed in ventilated cages
under standardized conditions (21°C, 60% humidity, 12-h
light/12-dark cycle, 20 air changes/hour) in the University
rodent barrier facility. Semi-purified modified AIN-76A
diet ingredients were purchased from Bioserv, Inc., NJ.
Generation of p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice expressing
the activated KrasG12D oncogene has been described
previously [17, 18]. The GEM KrasG12D (LSLKras/ElaCreERT mice) alone or crossed with COX2 conditional
knockout mice (COXKO/LSL-Kras/Ela-CreERT) were
used to study the effect of ablation of COX-2 on DclK1.
The dual COX/5-LOX inhibitor Licofelone was procured
from the NCI-DCP chemoprevention drug repository.

Preclinical assay: efficacy of licofelone
Genotyped male and female p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+
transgenic mice were used in the efficacy study. Five
week-old mice were selected and randomized so that
average body weights in each group were equal and were
fed AIN-76A diet for one week. At 6 weeks of age, p48Cre/+LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice were fed AIN-76A experimental diets
containing 0 ppm (n = 34/group + n = 12 C57BL/6 wildtype mice), 250 ppm (n = 28/group) or 500 ppm n = 24/
group licofelone in the diet until termination of the study.
After 38 weeks (~10 months) on experimental diets, all
mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and necropsied;
pancreata were collected from all groups, weighed
and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis.

Histological analysis of panIN lesions and PDAC

Apoptosis assay

Formalin fixed tissue sections (4 μm) of each
pancreas stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)
were histologically evaluated by a pathologist blinded to
the experimental groups. PanIN lesions and carcinoma
were classified according to histopathologic criteria as
recommended elsewhere [4, 12–18]. Similarly, pancreatic
carcinoma and normal appearing pancreatic tissue were
evaluated in all animals.

Paraffin sections (N = 6 mice/group) of 5-μm
thickness mounted on slides were rehydrated and
stained using the Fragment End Labeling (FragEL)
DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit with the terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) method following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA). This kit allows
the recognition of apoptotic nuclei in paraffin-embedded
tissue sections fixed on slide by FragEL of DNA. The
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase binds to exposed
ends of DNA fragments generated in response to apoptotic
signals and catalyzes the template-dependent addition of
biotin-labeled and biotin-unlabeled deoxynucleotides.
Biotinylated nucleotides are detected using streptavidinHRP conjugate. Diaminobenzidine reacts with the
labeled sample to generate an insoluble colored product
at the site of DNA fragmentation. Counter-staining with
methyl green aids in the morphologic evaluation and
characterization of normal and apoptotic cells. Stained
apoptotic epithelial cells (a minimum of 10 microscopic
fields per section) were counted manually in a single-blind
fashion.

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
5 μm fixed sections were incubated with primary
antibodies in a hybridization chamber for 1 h at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies
used were DclK1, COX-2, 5-LOX, Ki67, proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA), CD133, CD44, Lgr5, Annexin V
and β-catenin procured from Santa Cruz/Abgent/Abcam/
Abcam/Cell Signaling. Following primary antibody,
sections were incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse/antirabbit/anti-goat secondary antibody, then visualized with
diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with H&E
for IHC or with DAPI for immunohistofluorescence (IHF).
Slides were observed under an Olympus microscope
1X701 and digital computer images were recorded with
an Olympus DP70 camera.

Quantitative real-time PCR for miRNA analysis

Analysis of COX-1 and -2 activity using
Radio-high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC)

The RT2 miRNA PCR Array Mouse miRNA
Panel v1.7 (SABiosciences, Frederick, MDA, USA) was
employed for miRNA profiling. The RT2 qPCR-Grade™
miRNA Isolation Kit (SA Biosciences) was used to enrich
small RNA. The RT2 miRNA First Strand Kit was used
to convert small RNA into cDNA. Reverse transcription
(RT) was performed at 37°C for 2 h by incubating a 10 ul
mixture including 400 ng of small RNA, 5X miRNA RT
primer, 1ul ERC mix, 2ul reverse transcription buffer, 1ul
RT enzyme mix, and nuclease-free water. The quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixtures,
consisting of 100 ul of diluted first reaction, 1.275 mL 2X
RT2 SYBR master mix (SABiosciences, Frederick, MDA,
USA), and 1.175 ul nuclease-free water, were incubated
for 40 cycles on a Bio-Rad IQ-5 real-time PCR System
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Each cycle included
denaturing for 15 s at 95°C, annealing and extension
for 30 s at 60°C, and 30 s at 72°C. The comparative Ct
method was used to compute relative levels of target
miRNAs by subtracting the Ct values of the endogenous
control. Samples were reported as n-fold relative to the
calibrator set at 1.0.

Frozen pancreatic tumor tissues from male mice
fed 250 or 500 ppm of licofelone or control diet were
homogenized using ice-cold homogenizing buffer.
For COX-1 and COX-2 assays, 150 μL of reaction
mixture containing 12 μmol/L [14C] arachidonic acid
(AA; 420, 000 dpm), 1 mmol/L epinephrine, 1 mmol/L
glutathione in 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)
were incubated with 30 mg of lysate protein at 37°C
for 20  minutes. The reactions were terminated by
adding  40  μL of 0.2mol/L HCl. The COX-mediated
metabolites of AA were extracted with ethyl acetate
(3  × 0.5 mL). The combined extracts were evaporated
to dryness under N2, dissolved in 1 mL  of acetonitrile
and 10 μL were injected into a reverse phase HPLC
system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, USA)
equipped with a Phenomenix C18 column (300  ×  3.90
mm; pore  size 10 μ). The [14C]-PGs, [14C]-TxB2 and
[14C]-PGE2 were eluted with a gradient solvent system
