Abstract
Inappropriate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been directly linked to medulloblastoma (MB), a common
malignant brain tumor in children. GDC-0449 is an Hh pathway inhibitor (HPI) currently under clinical
investigation as an anticancer agent. Treatment of a MB patient with GDC-0449 initially regressed tumors, but
this individual ultimately relapsed with a D473H resistance mutation in Smoothened (SMO), the molecular
target of GDC-0449. To explore the role of the mutated aspartic acid residue in SMO function, we substituted
D473 with every amino acid and found that all functional mutants were resistant to GDC-0449, with positively
charged residues conferring potential oncogenic properties. Alanine scan mutagenesis of SMO further identified
E518 as a novel prospective mutation site for GDC-0449 resistance. To overcome this form of acquired resistance,
we screened a panel of chemically diverse HPIs and identified several antagonists with potent in vitro activity
against these GDC-0449–resistant SMO mutants. The bis-amide compound 5 was of particular interest, as it was
able to inhibit tumor growth mediated by drug resistant SMO in a murine allograft model of MB. However, focal
amplifications of the Hh pathway transcription factor Gli2 and the Hh target gene cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) were
observed in two additional resistant models, indicating that resistance may also occur downstream of SMO.
Importantly, these HPI resistant MB allografts retained their sensitivity to PI3K inhibition, presenting additional
opportunities for the treatment of such tumors. Cancer Res; 71(2); 435–44. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
MB is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the cerebellum, which is thought to originate from immature granule
neural precursors (GNPs) located in the external granule layer
(1). It is the most common brain malignancy among children
0–4 years old and accounts for nearly 18% of pediatric
intracranial tumors, with 350 new cases being diagnosed each
year in the United States (2). Many patients still succumb to
this disease and a large number of survivors suffer from
debilitating therapy-related side effects, highlighting the need
for alternative therapies.
Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is indispensable for normal
embryonic development, yet this pathway is mostly dormant
in healthy adults (see ref. 3 for a comprehensive review).
Proper signaling is initiated by binding of 1 of 3 Hh ligands

(Sonic [SHH], Indian [IHH] or Desert [DHH] Hedgehog) to
the inhibitory receptor Patched (PTCH1), which somehow
alleviates repression of SMO. Through a series of poorly
understood events that at least partly take place in primary
cilia, this G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)–like signal
transducer promotes activation of GLI transcription factors
that facilitate transcription of Hh target genes. Suppressor of
fused (SUFU) is a negative regulator of this pathway and acts
by binding directly to GLI transcription factors, affecting
both their nuclear trafficking and ability to transcribe DNA.
Hh signaling was initially linked to cancer through the
discovery that Gorlin Syndrome patients, who have a high
incidence of sporadic MB, possess inherited inactivating
mutations in PTCH1 (4). Constitutive Hh signaling has
subsequently been shown in 25% of sporadic MBs, with loss
of function PTCH1 or SUFU mutations occurring in approximately half of these cases (5, 6).
GDC-0449 is an orally bioavailable SMO antagonist that has
produced promising antitumor responses in a Phase I study of
patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a type of
skin cancer also driven by mutations in Hh pathway components (7). Furthermore, GDC-0449 promptly regressed tumors
and reduced symptoms in a 26-year-old man with metastatic
MB that was unmanageable by conventional therapies (8).
However, the dramatic response of this patient to GDC-0449
treatment was transient, as most of his metastatic tumors

recurred, and biopsy of one of these revealed resistance to this
HPI due to a mutation in SMO (9).
We report here a novel prospective mutation site in SMO
that could also confer resistance to this HPI. We further
identify several antagonists with potent activity against these
drug resistant SMO mutants, and provide evidence for downstream mechanisms of GDC-0449 resistance. Consequently,
overcoming acquired resistance may involve targeting alternative pathways and we show that interfering with PI3K/AKT
signaling may be a valid option for HPI-resistant tumors.

Materials and Methods
Alanine scan mutagenesis
SMO mutants were generated from pRK5-SMO as described
(9). Alanines were mutated to leucine (CTG), whereas all other
residues were mutated to alanine (GCA).
[3H]-GDC-0449-binding assays
The 2  106 HEK-293 cells were seeded into 10-cm plates
and transfected 16 hours later with 3 mg of SMO expression
construct using GeneJuice (Novagen). After 40 hours, cells
were harvested with PBS containing 1 mmol/L EDTA, fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and washed 3 times
with PBS. 2  105 cells per well were seeded into a 96 well plate
and incubated in PBS for 1 hour at 37 C with 5 nmol/L [3H]GDC-0449 (0.05 mCi) in the presence or absence of 50 mmol/L
unlabeled GDC-0449. Cells were transferred to filter plates
(Perkin Elmer # 6005174) using a cell harvester (Wallac),
washed 6 times and dried. Radioactivity was measured using
Microscint-20 scintillation fluid and a Topcount reader (both
from Perkin Elmer). Data were either displayed as raw counts,
or were normalized to SMO-WT after subtraction of background values (obtained from untransfected cells).
Drug treatment of animals with MB allografts
Tumor-bearing animals were generated via serial subcutaneous propagation of murine Ptchþ/; p53/ MB tumor lines
(10). Subcutaneous tumors 1500–2000 mm3 were excised from
donor mice under aseptic conditions, minced in High Glucose
DMEM by repeated slicing and chopping with scalpel blades,
and passed through a cell dissociation sieve (Sigma, CD1–
1KT). The resulting single-cell suspension was washed twice in
High Glucose DMEM and filtered through a 70-mm nylon cell
strainer (BD Falcon) before counting in a Vi-CELL cell viability
analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Approximately 2.5–10  106 live
cells in a 100-mL volume were injected subcutaneously into the
right lateral thorax of 7 to 10-week-old female CD-1 nude mice
(CRL). Tumor dimensions were measured with Ultra Cal IV
calipers (Fred V. Fowler Company Inc.) and tumor volumes
were calculated using the formula v ¼ 0.5  a  b2, where a
and b are the shortest and longest perpendicular tumor
diameters, respectively. When tumors reached 125–350
mm3, animals were separated into treatment groups with
similarly sized tumors and drug administration was initiated.
Compounds were formulated in MCT and mice were administered orally 0.2 mL of either vehicle twice daily, compound
5 at 100 mg/kg once daily, or HhAntag at 100 mg/kg twice

436

Cancer Res; 71(2) January 15, 2011

daily for the HPI study, a single dose of GDC-0449 at 100 mg/kg
for the PD study, and either vehicle or GDC-0941 at 150 mg/kg
once daily for the PI3K inhibitor study. Mice were euthanized
if tumors exceeded 2,000 mm3 and/or if their body weight
dropped >20%. All mice were housed and maintained according to the animal use guidelines of Genentech Inc., conforming
to California State legal and ethical practices.
Statistical methods
Log2(tumor volume) growth traces were fitted to each
treatment group with restricted cubic splines for the fixed
time effect in each group. Fitting was done via a linear mixed
effects model, using the R package "nlme," version 3.1–96 (11)
in R version 2.9.2 (R Development Core Team 2008; R Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna, Austria).
Hh pathway gene status
Genomic DNA was isolated from tumors with the AllPrep
DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and every exon from murine Smo,
Sufu, and Gli2 was PCR-amplified using a pair of nested
primers containing M13 forward and reverse sequences.
Excess primers and free nucleotides were removed with the
ExoSAP-IT kit (USB) and PCR products were cycle-sequenced
in both directions using M13 sequencing primers, a BigDye
Terminator v3.1 Kit and a 3730xl DNA analyzer (both Applied
Biosystems). Sequence files were analyzed using Sequencher
(GeneCodes) and Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics LLC)
software.
Gene copy number analyses
Tumor DNA was labeled and hybridized to Mouse Genome 244K CGH Microarrays (Agilent) as per manufacturer
recommended protocols, using normal diploid mouse genomic DNA as a reference. Data were normalized with Feature
Extraction Software v9.5 (Agilent) and copy number variable
regions were called in Nexus 4.0.1 (Biodiscovery) using a
rank segmentation algorithm. An arbitrary threshold for
copy number gains was set at log2 ratio values of 0.6, with
a minimum of 5 probes per segment. Copy number gains
were confirmed by qPCR on a MX3000P instrument (Stratagene) using 25 ng of genomic DNA/reaction. Target loci
were compared with murine SINE1 elements and quantified
on standard curves of normal diploid mouse DNA as
described (12) using the following primers:
Gli2 F: 5'-GCAGGACATTCCACACAGTTCTTG-3',
Gli2 R: 5'-ATAGGTGCTGGGATACAGGCTTG-3',
Ccnd1 F: 5'-TACCCTGACACCAATCTCCTCAACG-3',
Ccnd1 R: 5'-GGAATTCCCATCTTCCCAACTCC-3',
Sine1 F: 5'-AGATGGCTGAGTGGGTAAAGG-3' and
Sine1 R: 5'-GTGGAGGTCAGAGGACAAACTT-3'.

Results
D473 is important for SMO inhibition by GDC-0449
We previously reported that mutation of a conserved
aspartic acid residue in SMO interferes with GDC-0449 binding
and its ability to suppress tumor growth, without dramatically
altering the signaling activity of this protein (9). To better

position. We confirmed cell surface expression for several of
these mutants (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D) and tested
their ability to bind GDC-0449 (Fig. 1B). Similar to SMOD473H (9), resistance to this HPI correlated with a lack of
SMO-binding, indicating that D473 is critical for SMO inhibition by GDC-0449.
D473 could either be directly involved in GDC-0449 binding
or could simply be required to maintain the correct SMO
conformation for binding. Several mutants, including those
with a positive charge such as D473K and D473R, were more
active than SMO-WT and almost as active as the oncogenic
SMO-M2 mutant (Fig. 1A; 13), implying that D473 could be a
structurally important residue. Consistent with this notion,
SMO-D473K and SMO-D473R have autoactivating properties
and, like SMO-M2, are resistant to inhibition by PTCH1
(Fig. 1C).

characterize the role of D473 in SMO function, we substituted
this residue with every amino acid and analyzed the resulting
mutants in a Gli-luciferase reporter assay in the presence or
absence of 1 mmol/L GDC-0449 (Fig. 1A; Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Apart from the possibly misfolded SMO-D473P,
all mutants induced Hh pathway activity and were less
sensitive to GDC-0449 inhibition than SMO-WT. The seemingly responsive D473V mutant was partially drug-resistant
in a dose response assay (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Surprisingly, the conservative SMO-D473E mutant was also resistant
to GDC-0449, despite maintaining a negative charge at this

www.aacrjournals.org

E518 is also important for SMO inhibition by GDC-0449
We used an alanine scan mutagenesis approach to identify
additional residues in SMO critical for GDC-0449 binding
(Fig. 2A). Assuming that GDC-0449 binds SMO in a manner
reminiscent of GPCRs binding to their ligands, we mutated
regions known to be important for such interactions (14).
These include transmembrane helices (TM) 3, TM5, TM6, and
TM7 and adjacent amino acids as well as the entire third
extracellular loop of SMO, since it contains D473. We analyzed
a total of 102 SMO mutants, using GDC-0449 binding as a
primary readout (Supplementary Table S1). Most of the 21
new SMO mutants found to be deficient in GDC-0449 binding
were either inactive with respect to signaling or not expressed
at the cell surface. However, SMO-E518A showed significant
signaling activity despite the presence of 1 mmol/L GDC-0449
and proved to be partially resistant (Fig. 2B). It appears that
our binding assay is sensitive to even small changes in drug
affinity for SMO, since certain mutants deficient in GDC-0449
binding could still be inhibited at high drug concentrations.
We then introduced a more drastic amino acid substitution
that reverses the charge at this position and which can be
achieved through a single nucleotide change. This SMO-E518K
mutant has activity comparable to SMO-WT (Supplementary
Table S1), yet is completely resistant to GDC-0449 up to 1
mmol/L (Fig. 2B). Thus, we have identified E518 as a prospective novel mutation site in SMO that could confer resistance to
GDC-0449.
A screen of chemically diverse HPIs identified several
SMO-D473H and SMO-E518K antagonists
To identify SMO mutant inhibitors as potential therapeutics
for GDC-0449–resistant tumors, we screened a panel of 53
antagonists (representative compounds are shown in Fig. 3A)
with potent activity against the wild-type protein (Fig. 3B).
These inhibitors were either identified in high-throughput
screens (both in house and by others) or were generated by
hit-to-lead optimization of screening hits using traditional
medicinal chemistry methods. The 2 GDC-0449–resistant
mutants displayed clearly different requirements for inhibition in our Gli-luciferase reporter assay, as SMO-E518K was
completely resistant to the natural plant alkaloid cyclopamine

yet sensitive to the hyrazinoimine SANT-1 (15), while SMOD473H was partially resistant to both compounds. In addition,
various C-ring amide analogs of GDC-0449 had robust potency
against SMO-E518K, but were weakly active against SMOD473H, as exemplified by compound 1 (see Fig. 3A for A-, B-,
and C-ring nomenclature). However, the benzimidazole
HhAntag (16) was essentially equipotent against all SMO
alleles, whereas quinoxalines (represented by compound 2)
were found to have low activity against both mutants. Compound 3 showed measurable activity against SMO-D473H
despite having an identical C-ring to GDC-0449, and this
general class of bis-amides showed improved potencies
against both mutants once the optimal substitution pattern
was found, exemplified by compound 4.
Although we routinely use HhAntag as a tool compound to
block Hh signaling in mice, this inhibitor has a moderate-tohigh predicted hepatic clearance based on in vitro metabolic
stability assays using human liver microsomes and hepatocytes (19 and 12 mL/min/kg, respectively; data not shown),
and is therefore suboptimal as a therapeutic agent. To identify
a SMO antagonist that might be capable of overcoming
acquired GDC-0449 resistance in the clinic, we focused our
efforts on the bis-amide class of inhibitors. Three out of 14
drug candidates from this group exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties in mice (data not shown). Of these, we chose
to further investigate compound 5, which has a terminal halflife (t1/2) of about 22 hours (Fig. 3C) and displayed robust
activity against both wild type and SMO-D473H, inhibiting Gliluciferase reporter activity with an IC50 of 300 nmol/L and 700
nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 3D). These IC50 values are overestimates due to overexpression of SMO in this assay system;
the IC50 of compound 5 against endogenous human and
mouse SMO in the presence of Hh ligand is 8 nmol/L and
27 nmol/L, respectively.
Compound 5 inhibits tumor growth mediated by GDC0449–resistant SMO
To determine whether compound 5 could inhibit drug
resistant SMO in vivo, we generated mice with subcutaneous
allografts of the murine Ptchþ/; p53/ MB tumor line SG274.
These are resistant to GDC-0449 due to a D477G amino acid
substitution in SMO, the same aspartic acid residue that was
mutated in human SMO (9). Mice developed 125–350 mm3
tumors within 2 weeks, after which oral drug treatment was
initiated. Although tumor growth in GDC-0449–treated animals did not differ from vehicle, tumors in animals treated
with compound 5 not only stopped growing, but even started
to shrink during this relatively short time (9; Fig. 4A; Supplementary Figure S2). Tumor growth inhibition was accompanied by a downregulation in Gli1 mRNA levels (Fig. 4B),
indicating that compound 5 can suppress Hh signaling
mediated by GDC-0449–resistant SMO in vivo. Similar results
were obtained with HhAntag at twice the dosing frequency.
GDC-0449 and compound 5 both interfere with SMO
translocation to the primary cilium
Recently, several groups reported that diverse antagonists
differentially affect the trafficking and localization of SMO to

the primary cilium (17–19). To test the effect of GDC-0449 and
the SMO mutant inhibitors on SMO trafficking, we incubated
confluent S12 cells with the indicated compounds for 16 hours
in the absence or presence of Hh stimulation, and determined
whether endogenous SMO colocalized with the primary cilium
marker-acetylated tubulin (Fig. 4C and D). Control cells
[dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), -Hh] displayed very faint SMO
staining in only a few cilia. As previously reported (17–19),
stimulation with either Shh or the SMO agonist SAG (15)
resulted in robust translocation of SMO to the primary cilium,
as did cyclopamine treatment. Like SANT-1, GDC-0449 did not
promote ciliary enrichment and prevented Hh-induced SMO
translocation. Compound 5 and HhAntag had very similar
effects to GDC-0449 on SMO localization, suggesting that their
ability to inhibit D473H signaling does not involve SMO
trafficking. Conversely, KAAD-cyclopamine, a more potent
version of cyclopamine (20) that fully inhibits SMO-D473H

www.aacrjournals.org

at 1 mmol/L (9), partially induced ciliary translocation in the
absence of ligand (Supplementary Figure S3; Fig. 4D). Addition
of Shh did not alter the effect of any compound on SMO
localization. In short, we found no obvious correlation
between the ability of antagonists to affect SMO localization
and their capacity to inhibit GDC-0449–resistant mutants.
GDC-0449 has a differential effect on Gli1 mRNA
expression in 2 additional resistant MB allograft
models
We previously reported the establishment of 3 separate
drug-resistant MB tumor lines through intermittent dosing
with GDC-0449 (9). Only SG274 was found to carry a mutation
in Smo, indicating that additional mechanisms of resistance
to GDC-0449 exist in models SG102 and SG152. Although
mutations in the tumor-suppressor SUFU predispose individuals to MB (6) and could in theory confer resistance to SMO

antagonists, neither model was mutated in this gene. To
determine if these tumors had lost their dependence on Hh
signaling, we expanded the original resistant tumors and
asked whether the Hh pathway was still active in these MB
tumor lines (Fig. 5A). Gli1 levels in vehicle treated, GDC-0449–
resistant SG102 or SG152 allografts were comparable to those
with control or SMO mutant SG274 allografts, indicating that
the Hh pathway is similarly active in all models. Interestingly,
GDC-0449 treatment downregulated Gli1 levels in control and
SG102 tumors, but not in SG152 and SG274 tumors. These
observations suggest that SG102 and SG152 possess distinct
mechanisms of GDC-0449 resistance, independent of Smo or
Sufu mutations and, in the case of SG102, may entail an event
downstream of SMO-dependent Gli regulation.

models contained several regions of copy gains (data not
shown), including an amplification of a region on chromosome 7 harboring the Hh target gene cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) in
model SG102, whereas model SG152 had a high-level focal
amplification of a region on chromosome 1 encompassing
the Hh pathway transcription factor GLI2 (Supplementary
Figure S4). Although cyclin D1 and GLI2 act downstream of
SMO and have previously been implicated in the development of MB, we formally cannot rule out involvement of the
other genomic alterations in GDC-0449 resistance. The Ccnd1
and Gli2 amplifications were independently confirmed by
qPCR in SG102 and SG152, when compared with GDC-0449sensitive control and SMO mutant SG274 tumors (Fig. 5B).
These genomic alterations correlated with enhanced mRNA
expression and elevated protein levels of both cyclin D1 and
GLI2 (Fig. 5B–D). GLI2 contains an aminoterminal repressor
domain that when deleted results in a constitutively active
protein with 30 times higher transcriptional activity (21).
Sequencing of Gli2 in model SG152 revealed no truncating
mutations and both the full-length and repressor forms were
detected by immunoblotting, indicating that GLI2 processing

HPI resistant MB allografts are sensitive to PI3K
inhibition
Given the identification of resistance mechanisms downstream of SMO, we looked at other signaling pathways implicated in MB to see if targeting any of these might be an
alternative therapeutic approach to combating GDC-0449
resistance. Abnormal phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
signaling promotes tumor growth and survival of many
human cancers, including MB (23, 24). We therefore examined
the level of activated AKT (phosphorylated at Ser473) and
activated S6 (phosphorylated at Ser235/236) in our MB allograft models and were able to detect both phospho-proteins,
suggesting that the PI3K/AKT pathway is active in these
tumors (Fig. 6A). However, it is unlikely that increased

PI3K/AKT signaling contributes to resistance, since AKT and
S6 were also phosphorylated in GDC-0449-sensitive control
tumors and an obvious PI3K gene-expression signature (25–
27) was lacking in the microarray profiles of the resistant
models when compared with sensitive controls (data not
shown). Importantly, the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (28) greatly
reduced tumor growth in both control and resistant models,
indicating that HPI-resistant tumors maintain their dependence on PI3K signaling (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Fig. S5).
Tumor growth inhibition in all models was accompanied
by PI3K pathway modulation, as GDC-0941 treatment
decreased pAKT and pS6 levels (Fig. 6A). However, GDC0941 treatment only had a limited effect on cyclin D1 levels
in SG152 and SG274 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6), suggesting that the PI3K pathway promotes tumor growth via Ccnd1independent mechanisms in MB, as is the case in GNPs (22).
Consequently, pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling may represent a promising therapeutic approach to
treating HPI-resistant MB.

Discussion
SMO is the first GPCR-like protein that has been targeted
therapeutically for an oncology indication. As for many other
cancer therapies (29), resistance via mutation of the drug
target has quickly emerged (9). To better characterize the
role of D473 in HPI resistance, we replaced this residue with
every amino acid and found that, whereas all functional
mutants were GDC-0449-resistant to varying degrees, certain substitutions led to increased signaling, potentially via
induction of a conformational change in SMO. Although
D473H displayed no significant increase in signaling in our
in vitro reporter assay, these observations suggest that
modification at this site could result in a growth advantage
for mutants that may contribute to their emergence prior to
drug treatment. Thus mutation of D473 may confer a selective growth advantage in vivo.
Using alanine scan mutagenesis of candidate ligandbinding regions, we identified E518 as a novel SMO residue
important for inhibition by GDC-0449. Although most
mutants deficient in GDC-0449 binding were either inactive
or not expressed at the cell surface, alanine substitution of
M326, F460, or L515 activated SMO without altering sensitivity to GDC-0449. More drastic amino acid substitutions
at these positions may further increase activity and generate GDC-0449–resistant SMO mutants, especially since a
previous study showed that cyclopamine resistance positively correlated with the potency of activating SMO
mutants (20).
In addition to identifying several potent SMO mutant
inhibitors, our screen of chemically diverse HPIs provided
some unexpected insights into the binding mode of GDC-0449.
Substituting the A-ring of GDC-0449 with one that contains
both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor (as in compound 3)
improved potency against SMO-D473H, whereas SMO-E518K
was more sensitive to changes in the C-ring (like those
introduced by compound 1). It is therefore tempting to
speculate that D473 and E518 are part of a GDC-0449 binding

442

site in SMO and interact with the A- and C-ring, respectively.
These residues are likely shared with or in close proximity to
other binding sites, as several SMO antagonists were less
effective against these GDC-0449–resistant mutants. Cocrystallization of SMO with GDC-0449 may be required to elucidate the binding site and precise contribution of these
residues.
Rohatgi and colleagues (19) recently proposed a 2-step
mechanism for SMO activation, in which full activation of
this protein requires ciliary transport coupled to an as yet
unidentified second activation step that allows SMO to engage
the downstream signaling machinery in cilia. A key concept of
their model is that SMO antagonists can be subdivided in 2
classes; "SANT-1-like" inhibitors that influence trafficking of
SMO to cilia and "cyclopamine-like" inhibitors that affect the
activation step. The authors further proposed that their model
might be useful for overcoming drug resistance, anticipating
complementary roles for these 2 classes of SMO antagonists in
the clinic due to lack of cross-resistance. However, this model
does not explain SMO-D473–mediated GDC-0449 resistance.
Our data clearly show that inhibitors from the same class can
in fact be used to overcome drug-resistance, as the SMO
mutant inhibitors compound 5 and HhAntag-affected SMO
localization indistinguishably from GDC-0449. Furthermore,
antagonists from different classes can display cross-resistance, since neither cyclopamine nor SANT-1 could fully
inhibit SMO-D473H. Therefore, an alternative explanation
for the distinct effects of HPIs on SMO trafficking may be
that antagonists can induce slightly different SMO conformations that favor a particular localization over another, or they
could have dissimilar cell permeabilities limiting access to
preciliary sites.
Our SMO mutant inhibitors and other HPIs, such as those
that antagonize GLI function (30–32), are of limited use if
resistance occurs downstream of the molecular target.
Indeed, we identified Ccnd1 and Gli2 amplification as plausible mechanisms of GDC-0449 resistance downstream of
SMO. Both candidate resistance genes have previously been
implicated in MB formation. Cyclin D1 promotes proliferation through its ability to bind and stimulate both CDK4 and
CDK6, leading to phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
protein and entry into the cell cycle (33). Genetic ablation
of Ccnd1 drastically reduces the incidence of MB in Ptchþ/
mice (34), whereas enforced expression of cyclin D1 in
Ink4c/-; p53/ GNPs enabled cells to initiate MBs when
injected back into the brains of immunocompromised recipient animals (35). High cyclin D1 levels likely sustain tumor
cell proliferation in the presence of GDC-0449, as Ccnd1
expression is no longer reliant on Hh signaling due to the
gene amplification.
Although relatively rare, GLI2 amplifications have been
observed in human MB (36). Tissue-specific expression of
a constitutively active form of this transcription factor
can lead to MB when ciliogenesis is impaired (37). Furthermore, the oncogenic potential of GLI2 has been firmly
established in a mouse model of BCC (38) and viralmediated expression of the full-length protein allows GNPs
to proliferate in vitro in the absence of Hh ligand (22).

Mechanisms of Resistance to a Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitor

Similarly, enhanced GLI2 expression by means of gene
amplification would render the Hh pathway in tumor
cells obviously SMO-independent and therefore GDC-0449
insensitive.
An alternative approach to overcoming acquired resistance
is to target other oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/AKT
signaling. Human MB samples frequently exhibit activated
AKT, and proliferation of human MB cell lines can be attenuated in vitro with PI3K inhibitors (24, 39). Furthermore, a
recent study reported reduced or absent expression of PTEN, a
major inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT pathway, in over half of the
human MB samples analyzed (40). Our PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 was able to greatly reduce the growth of HPI-resistant
MB allografts, offering extra opportunities for the treatment of
such tumors. Additional studies are required to determine
whether combinatorial treatment of MB with GDC-0449 and a
PI3K inhibitor can prevent or delay the onset of acquired
resistance.

Note: While the article was in review, Buonamici and
colleagues (41) also reported Gli2 amplification as a mechanism of resistance to HPI.
