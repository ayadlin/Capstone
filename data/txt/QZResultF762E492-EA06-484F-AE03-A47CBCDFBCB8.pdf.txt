Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are strongly associated with tumor progression and have been used as novel
cell-based agents to deliver anticancer drugs to tumors. However, controversies about the direct involvement of
MSCs in tumor progression suggest that MSCs mediate tumor progression in a cancer type-dependent manner. In
this report, we analyzed the functional interactions between human MSCs and lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) cells
to determine the therapeutic potential of MSCs in lung cancer. We showed that MSCs effectively inhibited the
migration, invasion, and cell-cycle progression of several LAC cell lines. MSCs also enhanced the mesenchymal–
epithelial transition (MET) pathway, as evidenced by the reduction of several epithelial–mesenchymal transitionrelated markers in LAC cells cocultured with MSCs or in MSC-conditioned medium (MSC-CM). By cytokine array
analysis, we determined that Oncostatin M (OSM), a differentiation-promoting cytokine, was elevated in the MSCCM derived from primary MSC cultures. Furthermore, OSM treatment had the same effects as MSC-CM on
LAC, whereas neutralizing antibodies to OSM reversed them. Notably, short hairpin RNAs against STAT1, an
important downstream target of OSM, hindered the OSM-dependent induction of MET. In vivo xenograft tumor
studies indicated that OSM inhibited tumor formation and metastasis of LAC cells, whereas neutralizing OSM in
the MSC-CM hampered its inhibitory effects. In conclusion, this study showed that OSM is a paracrine mediator of
MSC-dependent inhibition of tumorigenicity and activation of MET in LAC cells. These effects of OSM may
serve as a basis for the development of new drugs and therapeutic interventions targeting cancer cells. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancerrelated mortality worldwide despite continuous efforts to ﬁnd
effective treatments (1). Lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) is the
most common histologic type of lung cancer. The highly
invasive and metastatic phenotypes of LAC are the major
reasons for treatment failure and the poor prognosis associated with this disease. Stem cell-based therapy is an emerging
strategy to treat various diseases, including cancer. Rat umbil-

ical cord matrix stem cells have been shown to inhibit murine
lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) growth (2). However, further work
in human lung cancer models is still needed to clarify the
therapeutic potential of this approach. Mesenchymal stem
cells (MSC) have recently gained much attention for their
potential applications in tissue engineering and disease therapy. Their tropism for sites of tissue damage and the tumor
microenvironment has led to a great deal of interest in the
functions of MSC in tumors and their ability to serve as delivery
vehicles for therapeutic agents (3–5). For example, MSC-based
delivery of the death receptor ligand TRAIL leads to the
inhibition of tumor growth and the elimination of cancer
metastasis in xenograft lung tumor models (6, 7) as well as
a reduction in the number of putative lung cancer stem cells
(8). However, the effects of MSCs themselves on cancer progression, as well as the crosstalk mechanisms between MSCs
and cancer cells, remain controversial and unclear.
The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical
process during embryonic development that is reengaged in
adults during wound healing, tissue regeneration, and cancer
progression (9). EMT is a key step in the induction of tumor
metastasis and is associated with a poor clinical outcome in
cancer patients (10). An aberrant upregulation of EMT transcription factors is associated with poor overall and metastasis-free survival in patients with non–small cell lung cancer

(11, 12). Targeting the EMT pathway or inducing the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET), the inverse of EMT, has
been reported to suppress lung cancer progression and metastasis (13–15) and may therefore represent a potential treatment strategy for LAC patients. Notably, the composition of the
microenvironment, including oxygen tension, growth factors,
and cytokines, was recently suggested to modulate the MET
and EMT process in cancer cells (16–19). MSCs are an important source of many chemokines and cytokines that affect the
tissue repair process (20). MSC-secreted cytokines have also
been implicated in the MSC-mediated regulation of tumor
cells. However, whether MSCs mediate LAC tumor progression
through a paracrine mechanism and whether MSC-derived
cytokines are involved in LAC tumorigenesis and MET remain
open questions.
Oncostatin M (OSM) is a differentiation-promoting cytokine that has been reported to induce hepatocyte differentiation of human embryonic and putative liver cancer stem
cells (21, 22). Recently, OSM was shown to promote MSC
differentiation into osteoblasts (23). OSM is also reported to
have antiproliferation effects against several types of cancers
and is thus considered a potential therapeutic target (21, 24–
28). However, the role of OSM in tumor progression and
metastasis has yet to be evaluated. In this study, we aimed to
investigate the role of MSCs and their mediators in the
regulation of lung cancer progression. We ﬁrst showed that
both MSCs and MSC-conditioned medium (MSC-CM) inhibited in vivo tumor growth and the in vitro proliferation,
migration, and invasion of LAC cells in a dose-dependent
manner. Moreover, both MSCs and MSC-CM promoted the
MET process in LAC cells, as evidenced by elevated pro-MET
markers, inhibited pro-EMT regulators, and suppressed
Nanog stemness factor. We then analyzed the cytokine
composition of the MSC-CM and identiﬁed OSM as an
important mediator of the MSC-dependent inhibition of
LAC tumorigenicity. Treatment with recombinant OSM
repressed LAC proliferation, migration, invasion, and
promoted MET as well as epithelial-like phenotypic transformation. Conversely, neutralizing OSM in the MSC-CM
hindered these effects on LAC cells. Most importantly, a
xenograft tumor model revealed that OSM reduced the
tumor size, suppressed the incidence of metastasis, and
enhanced MET markers. In conclusion, this study identiﬁed
OSM as a crucial paracrine mediator of the MSC-dependent
inhibition of LAC tumorigenicity, in part by enhancing the
MET pathway.

Materials and Methods
Cancer cell lines and culture conditions
A549 LAC cell line, H1299 large cell carcinoma cell line,
A431 epidermal carcinoma cell line, and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (including MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection before
2007 and tested positive for human origin. The CL1-5 LAC
cell line was established previously (29). All cell lines were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS.

Collection of CM
MSCs were seeded at a density of either 5  105 (low) or
2  106 (high) cells/100-mm plate in complete RPMI-1640 or
MesenPRO RS (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with preselected FBS, P/S, and L-glutamine. CM was collected after
24 hours of incubation with MSCs, ﬁltered with a 0.2-mm
pore size Millex ﬁlter unit (Millipore), and then stored at
80 C. Control medium was produced simultaneously after
a 24-hour incubation without MSCs.
Animals and tumor cell transplantation
Luciferase-expressing CL1-5 (CL1-5-luc) cells were harvested, washed, resuspended in PBS, and mixed with an equal
volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences). CL1-5-luc cells, MSCs, or
a mixed population of CL1-5-luc cells and MSCs (in a total
volume of 100 mL) were injected subcutaneously into the right
dorsolateral side of the ﬂank region of 8-week-old male BALB/c
nude mice (BioLasco Taiwan Co.). The tumors were measured
with an IVIS Lumina II system (Caliper Life Science).
Migration and invasion assay
A FluoroBlok 24-Multiwell Insert System with an 8-mm pore
size polyethylene terephthalate membrane (BD Falcon) was
used to test cell mobility. Each well was ﬁlled with 700 mL
medium, and cell suspensions were seeded into the insert
chamber at a density of 2.5  104 cells in 300 mL medium. After
24 hours, the medium was removed, and the chamber was
washed with 1 PBS and ﬁxed in 100% methanol overnight.
The reverse side of the membrane facing the lower chamber
was stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30
minutes, and the migratory cells were then visualized under
an inverted microscope. Cell number was quantitated using
ImageJ software. For the invasion assay, the membrane was
coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) diluted with an equal
volume of serum-free medium and incubated for at least 1 hour
at 37 C before the cells were seeded.
Proliferation assay
Cells were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates at a density
of 1  103 cells/well in 100 mL media and allowed to adhere
overnight. The media was aspirated and replaced with MSCCM or MesenPRO RS medium with or without recombinant
OSM (Peprotech) as described. A WST-1 (Roche Applied
Science) assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's
protocol to assess the changes in relative cell density every
24 hours.
Statistical analysis
The results are reported as the mean  SD. Statistical
analyses were carried out using Student t test. A P value
<0.05, as denoted with " " in ﬁgures, was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

reports in the past decade have investigated the physical and
functional interactions between MSCs and different types of
cancer cells (e.g., breast, liver, and colon), their relationships
remain controversial. Moreover, the roles of MSCs in lung
cancer progression and development are still unclear and need
to be further investigated. To examine the effects of MSCs on
lung cancer cell tumorigenicity, we ﬁrst conducted xenotransplantation experiments in immunocompromised mice. Primary bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from clinical
specimens taken from 3 healthy donors and analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry to conﬁrm the expression of MSC markers and the
absence of macrophage, endothelia, and hematopoietic cell
markers (1 representative MSCs shown in Supplementary
Fig. 1). The MSCs were then mixed with luciferase-labeled
CL1-5 human LAC cells at a ratio of 1:5 (CþM (low)) or 1:10
(CþM (high)) before subcutaneous injection into the right
ﬂanks of male mice. Injections of either MSCs or CL1-5 cells
alone were conducted simultaneously (Fig. 1A, top; n ¼ 4), and
tumor volumes were monitored for 7 weeks. As expected, the
CL1-5-induced xenograft tumors signiﬁcantly increased in
size. However, when mixed with MSCs, regardless of the ratio,
the growth of the CL1-5 xenograft tumors were dramatically
inhibited (Fig. 1A). At day 49, the volume of the CL1-5/MSC
tumors was approximately one tenth that of the CL1-5 tumors
(Fig. 1A, bottom right). These data indicated an in vivo inhibitory effect of MSCs on LAC tumor growth.
The inhibitory effect of MSCs on LAC cell-derived tumors
could occur through direct cell–cell contacts or in a paracrine
fashion without direct cell contact. To distinguish between
these possibilities, we ﬁrst subcutaneously transplanted luciferase-labeled CL1-5 cells in the right ﬂank of immunocompromised mice. Two weeks after transplantation, when the
tumor mass was visible using an IVIS Lumina Imaging system,
control or CM that had been incubated for 24 hours without or
with MSCs, respectively, was injected at the tumor locus. The
injections were conducted on days 14, 21, 28, and 35, and the
tumor volumes were assessed on day 55 by measuring changes
in the mean total photon ﬂux using the IVIS system. The CL1-5
tumors in the CM-treated mice were signiﬁcantly smaller than
those of the mice treated with control medium (Fig. 1B; n ¼ 3).
These data suggested that the inhibitory effect of MSCs on LAC
tumor growth occurs through a paracrine pathway and may
not require direct cell–cell contact.
MSC-CM inhibited the proliferation and cell-cycle
progression of LAC cells
The MSC-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in the animal
model indicated that MSCs may suppress cell proliferation or
cell-cycle progression in LAC cells. We therefore carried out
WST-1 proliferation assays for 2 LAC cell lines (CL1-5 and
A549) incubated in control medium or 2 concentrations of
MSC-CM. No signiﬁcant differences in total cell number were
observed between groups on the ﬁrst day. However, after day 2,
CL1-5 and A549 cell numbers were reduced by MSC-CM in a
dose-dependent manner compared with the cells cultured in
control medium (Fig. 2A, left). By day 4, treatment with high
CM reduced the cell numbers by more than 50% compared
with control cells (Fig. 2A, right). Flow cytometry analysis of the

www.aacrjournals.org

2 cell lines revealed that treated cells were partially sequestered
in G1 phase: MSC-CM increased the percentage of CL1-5 and
A549 cells in G1 phase by 15% and 8%, respectively, compared
with cells treated with control medium (Fig. 2B). This
decreased rate of cell proliferation and restrained cell-cycle
progression could explain the inhibition of tumor growth
observed in the animal model.
MSC-CM inhibited migration, invasion, and EMT in LAC
cells
Migration and invasion are critical properties of the cancer
cells that initiate metastasis. To clarify the involvement of
MSCs in LAC migration, we carried out a wound-healing assay
with both LAC cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2C, the numbers of
migrating cells were decreased by MSC-CM in a dose-dependent manner compared with those treated with control medium. This effect was not due to a difference in proliferation rate,
as we observed an approximately 3- to 5-fold difference in the
number of migrating cells between control- and high CMtreated cells at 12 hours (Fig. 2C), whereas cell proliferation was
not affected within the ﬁrst 24 hours (Fig. 2A).
An indirect coculture assay was carried out to further assess
cell mobility (Fig. 3A, left). Reduced migration of CL1-5 cells
was observed when the bottom chamber was coated with
MSCs or ﬁlled with MSC-CM compared with noncoated or
control medium-ﬁlled controls, respectively (Fig. 3A, middle
and right). The same experiment was also conducted with
other 4 primary MSCs isolated from bone marrow or endometrium of 4 individuals (Supplementary Information). Each
of the MSCs showed inhibitory effect on CL1-5 migration,
indicating that the MSC-mediated inhibition of LAC cell
migration is rather a general phenomenon than a unique case
for a speciﬁc strain of MSC (Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover,
this phenomenon was not unique to CL1-5 cells; the migratory
abilities of 2 other lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H1299) were
also suppressed when cultured in MSC-CM (Fig. 3B, left). Apart
from migration, invasion is another important property of
malignant tumor cells. Using a Matrigel-coated Transwell
culture chamber, we showed that the invasion of both CL15 and A549 cells was inhibited by MSC-CM (Fig. 3B, middle).
Whether MSCs promote or inhibit cancer progression
remains controversial. Karnoub and colleagues reported that
MSCs within tumor stroma promote breast cancer metastasis
(32), and similar phenomena have also been observed in colon
cancer (33). On the other hand, accumulating reports show
that MSCs inhibit the tumorigenesis of several types of cancers,
such as hepatomas and lymphomas (34–37). To further validate our results, we carried out a migration assay using CL1-5
cells, the A431 epidermal carcinoma cell line, and the MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, which have been
reported to be stimulated, not inhibited, by MSCs in tumorigenicity assays (32, 38). As shown in Fig. 3B, only CL1-5 cells
were inhibited by MSC-CM; migration of the other cell lines
was slightly increased by this treatment. It should be noted that
the ratio of MSCs to cancer cells used in this experiment was
much less than that used in previous reports (32), which likely
explains the decreased stimulatory effect of MSC-CM on the
migration of breast and epidermal carcinoma cell lines

rest in RPMI medium resulted in a slight recovery of cell
mobility (10%); after 7 days of rest, the recovery was even
more apparent (Fig. 3C, bottom left and top right). Moreover,
by immunoﬂuorescence analysis and confocal microscopy, we
observed elevated expression of E-cadherin, a pro-MET marker, and reduced levels of vimentin, a pro-EMT marker, in cells
treated with MSC-CM (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that the
MSC-mediated inhibition of LAC migration may be caused by
certain molecule(s) released by MSCs into the medium and
that removing the molecule(s) by replacing the medium can
reverse the inhibition of cell mobility.
MSC-CM promoted MET in LAC cells
The EMT is strongly linked to cell mobility and cancer
metastasis. Repressing EMT or enhancing MET has been

proposed as a mechanism to inhibit cancer progression
(13–15, 39). Upon incubation in MSC-CM, the mesenchymallike CL1-5 cells adopted a more epithelial-like morphology (Fig.
4A, left). Western blot analysis also revealed increased cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) and E-cadherin expression, and decreased
vimentin, Snail, and Slug expression in MSC-CM-treated LAC
cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4A, right). However, the
level of another EMT-related transcription factor, Twist, was
not altered (data not shown). These data suggested that MSCCM treatment of LAC cells promotes a MET process that may
involve Snail and Slug but not Twist. Interestingly, although the
stemness factor Oct4 was not affected, Nanog expression was
suppressed by MSC-CM, indicating the involvement of Nanog
stemness signaling in the crosstalk between MSCs and LAC
cells. We previously reported that coexpression of Nanog and

the IL-6 receptor (IL6-R) subunit (IL6R), and their common receptor subunit (gp130) were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The data are presented as

in CM-treated cells are presented relative to the level measured in control medium-treated cells (right). B, CL1-5 and A549 cells were subjected to the

Figure 5. (Continued ) D, the morphology of CL1-5 cells after 24 hours of treatment with or without OSM is shown (left). CL1-5 and A549 cells were treated with
or without recombinant OSM (20 ng/mL) for the indicated durations and then subjected to Western blot analysis to determine the expression levels of EMTrelated proteins (middle). CL1-5 cells with stable knockdown of STAT1 were treated with or without OSM (20 ng/mL) for 24 hours, followed by Western blot
analysis of the indicated proteins (right).

the protein levels of Snail and Slug in A549 cells, whereas
neither Snail nor Slug overexpression affected Nanog levels,
suggesting that Nanog may be an upstream regulator of Snail
and Slug expression in some LAC cells (Fig. 4B). The stable cell
lines were treated with MSC-CM or control medium before a
migration assay. Compared with the vector control, overexpression of Nanog increased the number of migrating cells in
MSC-CM-treated cultures by more than 2-fold (Fig. 4C, left;
from 11.7% to 27.1%), whereas Snail- and Slug-overexpressing
lines presented a 50% increase in migration (from 11.7% to
18.0% and 17.4%, respectively). However, compared with control medium-treated cells, exposure to MSC-CM still induced a
pronounced reduction in migratory cell number, making the
slight rescue effect induced by Nanog, Snail, and Slug overexpression scarcely noticeable (Fig. 4C, left). These data suggested that enhancing Nanog, Snail, or Slug levels is not
sufﬁcient to render cells resistant to the MSC-CM-induced
inhibition of mobility. Similar results were observed in the
wound-healing assay. Though Nanog-overexpressing cell lines
showed better mobility than control cell lines, a 24-hour
treatment with MSC-CM still dramatically reduced their
migratory capacity and abrogated the signiﬁcant difference
between control and Nanog-expressing cells (Fig. 4C, right).
Western blot analysis of the CL1-5 stable cell lines showed that
the ectopically expressed Nanog and Slug were suppressed by
MSC-CM, whereas E-cadherin expression was elevated (Fig.
4D). Together, these data indicated that MSC-CM promotes
the MET process in LAC cells by suppressing EMT markers and
the Nanog stemness factor.
Oncostatin M mediated the MSC-dependent inhibition of
cell proliferation and migration
The inhibitory effects of MSC-CM on LAC cells suggested the
involvement of a paracrine mechanism mediated by molecules
secreted from MSCs. We used a cytokine array to determine the

www.aacrjournals.org

compositional differences between control medium and MSCCM. Within the array, the anticancer cytokine OSM presented a
more than 3-fold difference (Fig. 5A, left). An ELISA assay also
detected secreted OSM in the CM derived from 3 MSCs
compared with control medium (Supplementary Fig. 3A).
Moreover, the OSM mRNA was detected in MSCs by quantitative real-time PCR and visualized in agarose gel (Supplementary Fig. 3B and C). OSM is a multifunctional cytokine that
inhibits the growth of many types of tumor cells (25, 28, 41, 42).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of OSM receptor expression in LAC cells indicated that the level of OSM-speciﬁc
receptor subunits (LIFR and OSMR-b) was higher than that
of IL6 (IL6R), a cytokine reported to mediate MSC-dependent
regulation of cancer cells (Fig. 5A, middle). Treating LAC cells
with CM further enhanced the expression of the 2 OSM
receptor subunits, OSMR-b and LIFR (Fig. 5A, right), which
may magnify cellular sensitivity to OSM.
To investigate the effect of OSM on LAC cells, we ﬁrst carried
out a WST-1 cell proliferation assay on CL1-5 and A549 cells
treated with different concentrations of recombinant OSM. In
line with our previous ﬁndings, OSM treatment inhibited cell
proliferation: 3 days of 20 ng/mL OSM treatment reduced CL15 and A549 cell numbers by 40% and 25%, respectively, compared with untreated controls (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Although OSM has been reported to inhibit the growth of
many types of tumor cells (25, 28, 41, 42), its role in metastasis is
less well understood. We determined that addition of OSM to
the culture medium signiﬁcantly inhibited cell migration and
invasion of both LAC cell lines (Fig. 5B, top), as well as H2170
and H520 squamous carcinoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
5), in a dose-dependent manner. The use of a speciﬁc antibody
against OSM (aOSM, R&D Systems) to neutralize the OSM
secreted into the MSC-CM blocked the inhibitory effect of
MSC-CM and increased the migration and invasion of both
LAC cell lines compared with control anti-IgG-treated MSC-

CM (Fig. 5B, bottom). Immunoﬂuorescent staining of the CL1-5
cells treated with CM, OSM or OSM-neutralized CM
(CMþaOSM) indicated that OSM, like CM, elevated E-cadherin
and suppressed vimentin expression, whereas antibody against
OSM blocked these effects of MSC-CM (Fig. 5C). OSM also
affected cell morphology: 24 hours of OSM treatment induced
an epithelial-like phenotype in CL1-5 cells (Fig. 5D, left).
Western blot analysis of OSM-treated LAC cells showed that
OSM inhibited the expression of Nanog, Snail, and Slug but
elevated E-cadherin after 24 hours of treatment, suggesting an
enhanced MET process in both LAC cell lines (Fig. 5D, middle).
STAT1 is an important downstream target of OSM-dependent
pathways. Activation of STAT1 has been reported to be critical
for the efﬁcacy of anti-metastatic immunotherapies (43). The
anticancer effect of OSM against chondrosarcoma is thought
to work through the JAK3/STAT1 pathway (27). The activation
of STAT1 upon OSM treatment was conﬁrmed in the LAC cells
(Supplementary Fig. 6A). We then speciﬁcally knocked down
STAT1 or STAT3, another downstream target of OSM, using
lentiviral expressed short hairpin RNAs. After puromycin
selection for 2 weeks, the knocked down pool of cells were
treated with or without OSM (Fig. 5D, right; Supplementary Fig.
6C). Western blotting indicated that without OSM treatment,
knockdown of STAT1 had little effect on Nanog or Slug protein
levels. However, with OSM treatment, knockdown of STAT1,
but not STAT3, resulted in elevated levels of Nanog, Snail, and
Slug compared with a scramble control (SC). These data
indicated that the OSM-dependent inhibition of Nanog and
elevation of MET signaling may be mediated by a STAT1dependent pathway.
OSM reduced LAC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo
To investigate the anticancer effect and therapeutic potential of OSM in vivo, we pre-treated luciferase-labeled CL1-5 cells
with control medium, CM, OSM, or OSM-preneutralized CM
(CMþaOSM) and transplanted the cells into immunocompromised mice. As shown in Fig. 6A, tumors appeared 2 weeks after
transplantation in mice transplanted with control mediumtreated cells, whereas the luciferase signals in mice transplanted with CM- or OSM-treated cells were barely detectable
or signiﬁcantly lower. Interestingly, preneutralizing OSM in the
CM with a speciﬁc antibody reduced the inhibitory effect of the
CM and resulted in an elevated luciferase tumor signal compared with CM-treated mice (Fig. 6A). The same result was also
observed in mice transplanted with A549 cells (Fig. 6B, left;
Supplementary Fig. 7A). Immunoﬂuorescent staining of the
tumor sections indicated that CM reduced the population of
proliferating cells (Supplementary Fig. 7B). Treatments of CM
or OSM increased E-cadherin (Fig. 6B, right) but suppressed
vimentin (Supplementary Fig. 7C) expression level in the
subcutaneous tumors. To evaluate the anti-metastatic effect
of OSM, we conducted a tail vein injection of pretreated CL1-5
and A549 cells in immunocompromised mice. Two weeks after
transplantation, control medium, CM, OSM, or CMþaOSM was
injected into the mice 4 times at 7-day intervals. The tumor
nodules in the lungs were counted and shown in Fig. 6C. The
data clearly showed that CM and OSM reduced the number and
volume of metastatic tumor nodules, whereas exposure to

CMþaOSM abrogated the inhibitory effect. Histochemical
staining of the lung sections from CL1-5-injected mice showed
that CM or OSM treatment reduced the spread of tumors in
lung tissue (Fig. 6C, left). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of
the tumor tissues from the A549-injected mice showed that CM
and OSM elevated E-cadherin and suppressed Slug mRNA
levels, which were reversed by CM-aOSM (Supplementary Fig.
7D). Taken together, these data showed that OSM mediated the
CM-dependent elevation of MET and suppression of tumor
growth and metastasis in vivo.

Discussion
Tumor progression with metastasis is one of the major
causes of mortality in lung cancer patients and therefore
represents an important clinical challenge. EMT has been
considered a key mechanism responsible for the metastatic
progression of lung cancer (44). Enhanced EMT characteristics
are associated with poor overall and metastasis-free survival in
patients with non–small cell lung cancer (11). Targeting the
EMT pathway or enhancing MET has been proposed as a
promising therapeutic method to address cancer metastasis
and improve patient survival (45). Slug and Snail, EMT-related
transcription factors, have been reported to increase the
metastatic risk of lung cancer (11, 12, 15). In addition, stemness
factors like Nanog and Oct4 are also involved in EMT regulation and are correlated with a poor clinical outcome for LAC
patients (40). In this report, we showed that BM-MSCs isolated
from 3 different donors inhibited the migration, invasion,
proliferation, and cell-cycle progression of LAC cells through
a paracrine mechanism. The EMT regulators Nanog, Snail, and
Slug were all inhibited and the MET markers CK-18 and Ecadherin were elevated by MSC-CM, resulting in elevated MET
process in LAC cells. The inhibitory effect on cell migration was
also observed in endometrium-derived MSCs (Supplementary
Fig. 2), suggesting that this effect on LAC cells may share in
different types of MSCs. In an animal model, both MSCs and
MSC-CM suppressed LAC tumor growth and metastasis; the
treatment of MSC-CM enhanced MET and suppressed proliferation in the xenograft tumor tissues. Our data suggested that
molecules secreted from MSCs may have a therapeutic potential for lung cancer treatment.
OSM is a regulator of stem cell pluripotency and modulates
the differentiation of speciﬁc lineages. OSM induces osteogenesis in MSCs (23) and is involved in the differentiation of
hepatocytes from human ESCs (22, 46, 47). OSM has also been
reported to inhibit the proliferation of several tumor cell lines,
including melanoma, glioblastoma, and breast cancer cells
(21, 24–28). Yamashita and colleagues further showed that
OSM renders liver cancer stem cells sensitive to chemotherapy
by inducing hepatocyte differentiation (21). However, the effect
of OSM on cancer metastasis is less understood. Lacreuseette
and colleagues reported that some metastatic melanoma cells
lost the expression of OSMR-b (48), implying a role for OSM in
cancer metastasis. In the present study, we identiﬁed OSM as a
mediator of the MSC-dependent inhibition of LAC tumorigenicity. Interestingly, MSC-CM treatment increased the mRNA
expression of OSMR-b, which could be a mechanism to

Figure 6. OSM suppressed xenograft tumor growth and metastasis in an animal model. A, immunocompromised mice were subcutaneously transplanted with
CL1-5-Luc cells pew-treated with control medium, CM, OSM (20 ng/mL), or OSM-neutralized CM (CMþaOSM; CM preincubated with 2 mg/mL aOSM
for 1 hour). On day 5 and day 10, the same treatments were applied through peritumoral injections. Tumor volumes were monitored with an IVIS Lumina Live
Imager, and the graph shows the mean  SD of luciferase signal intensity on day 14 (n ¼ 3). B, a similar experiment as described in A was conducted with A549
cells. The tumor volumes were measured by a caliper on day 58 (left, n ¼ 3). Tumor sections were stained with anti-E-cadherin and Hoechst33258, and
observed under confocal microscope (right). C, immunocompromised mice were transplanted through tail veins with CL1-5 or A549 cells pretreated as
indicated. Two weeks after transplantation, control medium (100 mL), CM (100 mL), OSM (20 ng in 100 mL of control medium), or OSM-neutralized CM
(CMþaOSM; 100 mL of CM preincubated with 2 mg/mL aOSM for 1 hour) was injected into the mice 4 times at 7-day intervals through intraperitoneal injection.
Mice were sacriﬁced 3 months after transplantation. Tumor formation and histochemical staining of the CL1-5 tumor sections in lung were photographed (left).
The numbers of metastatic nodules in the lung was counted (top right), and the tumor volume in lung was calculated from the histographs using the formula

magnify the OSM pathway. The increased OSMR-b might be
possibly due to the OSM in MSC-CM, as Blanchard and
colleagues reported that OSM triggers the synthesis of
OSMR-b (49), though we did not rule out the involvements of
other soluble factors in regulating OSMR-b expression. We
showed that OSM inhibited LAC cell proliferation and reduced
xenograft tumor size in animal model. Moreover, OSM suppressed cell mobility and tended to induce MET in LAC cells;
mice transplanted with OSM-incubated LAC cells and treated
with OSM showed reduced metastatic tumor nodules in the
lungs, along with increased pro-MET parkers and suppressed
pro-EMT markers in tumor tissues. More importantly, preneutralizing OSM in MSC-CM reduced the effects of MSC-CM
on LAC cells. It should be noted that there may be other
cytokines also contributing to the MSC-CM-inhibited tumor
progression, as neutralizing OSM in MSC-CM did not
completely block this inhibition. Given that there is a gap in
OSM concentrations between high-CM and the recombinant
OSM we used, we suspected a synergistic cooperation of
cytokines in MSC-CM, presuming that natural and recombinant OSM have equal efﬁcacy. Potential candidates are currently under investigation. The downstream effector of OSM,
STAT1, has been linked to anti-metastasis signaling in melanoma cells (43). We showed that knockdown of STAT1, but not
STAT3 (Supplementary Fig. 6C), hampered the OSM-mediated
inhibition of Nanog and Slug, suggesting a role for STAT1 in the
OSM-regulated induction of MET involved in the metastasis of
LAC cells. We also showed that knockdown of STAT1 resulted
in increased cell mobility in LAC cells (Supplementary Fig. 6B).
Further studies are needed to dissect the signaling pathways in
LAC cells that are activated or inactivated in response to
extracellular OSM stimulation.
The relationship between MSCs and tumor cells is still
controversial (50). For example, BM-MSCs have been reported
to promote colon cancer growth by enhancing angiogenesis
and inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis (33). Direct coculture of
BM-MSCs with breast cancer cells suggested that BM-MSCs
stimulate the EMT in breast cancer cells and enhance cancer
metastasis (32). On the contrary, studies of liver cancer indicated that human MSCs inhibited the cell-cycle progression,
tumorigenesis, and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma
(34, 35), possibly through downregulated TGF-b or Wnt signaling (34, 35). These discordant studies suggest a cancer typedependent mechanism for MSC-mediated pro- or antitumor
effects. MSCs are the source of many chemokines and cytokines that can be anti- or pro-tumorigenic and contribute to a
state of immunotolerance (50). The complexity of their inter-

actions with tumor cells, the large range of cytokines and
growth factors they produce, and the receptors expression
levels of the tumor cells might also explain the inconsistent
effects of MSCs on tumorigenicity. Bergfeld and colleagues
have stated that MSCs can be the friends or foes of cancer cells,
depending on their origin, degree of differentiation, and the
type of tumor cells with which they interact (50). Our investigation of the interactions between MSCs and LAC cells not
only revealed inhibitory effects of MSCs on lung cancer growth
and metastasis but also provided insight into how this crosstalk is mediated. We proposed a model in which MSC-derived
OSM signals in a paracrine manner to LAC cells, resulting in
increased MET, and thereby suppress tumorigenicity. Further
studies are needed to evaluate the prospect of the extracellular
cytokine-MET signaling pathway as a target for therapeutic
development.
