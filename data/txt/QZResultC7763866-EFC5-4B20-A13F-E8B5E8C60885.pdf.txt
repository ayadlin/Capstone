ABSTRACT
Nimbolide is one of the main components in the leaf extract of Azadirachta
indica (A. indica). Accumulating evidence from various in vitro and in vivo studies
indicates that nimbolide possesses potent anticancer activity against several types of
cancer and also shows potential chemopreventive activity in animal models. The main
mechanisms of action of nimbolide include anti-proliferation, induction of apoptosis,
inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis, and modulation of carcinogen-metabolizing
enzymes. Although multiple pharmacodynamic (PD) studies have been carried out,
nimbolide is still at the infant stage in the drug development pipeline due to the
lack of systematic pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and long-term toxicological studies.
Preclinical PK and toxicological studies are vital in determining the dosage range
to support the safety of nimbolide for first-in-human clinical trials. In this review,
we will provide a comprehensive summary for the current status of nimbolide as
an anticancer and chemopreventive lead compound, and highlight the importance
of systematic preclinical PK and toxicological studies in accelerating the process of
application of nimbolide as a therapeutic agent against various malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

and insecticidal activity [6]. In addition, nimbolidehas
been found to possess antioxidant effect and free radical
scavenging activities. In comparison toazadirachtin and
ascorbic acid (vitamin C), nimbolide was shown to be a
more potent antioxidant [7]. Furthermore, nimbolidehas
been identified as one of the active ingredients of neem
extract, a widely available herbal product used in
traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine to treat acne, wound,
gastric ulcer, and infections [8, 9]. In a study by Cohen
and co-workers, nimbolide was reported to be the most
potent cytotoxic substance among 6 limonoids examined
[10]. Through investigation of nimblolide’s action in
multiple cancer cell lines, various molecular targets were
thus identified. Hence, the mechanistic interpretation of
its pharmacodynamic actions can be derived. The major
signaling pathways by which nimbolide exerts its effects

Azadirachtaindica, commonly known as neem,
is a tree belonging to the Meliceae family, which is
native to India and the Indian Subcontinent. Today,
neem is well distributed across the world in at least 30
countries including Asia, Africa, and America [1]. Natural
compounds that have been identified from various parts
of A.indica include azadirachtin, salannin, nimbolide,
nimbin, and nimbic acid [2]. Among them, nimbolide is
a major tertranortriterpenoid, isolated from the leaves of
A.indica. Hence, nimbolideis accessible and affordable,
owing to the abundance of neem trees in tropical regions.
More importantly, nimbolide is well known for its many
uses, such as anti-malaria [3], antibacterial activity
against S.aureus and S.coagulase [4], anti-feedant [5],

In addition, the anticancer and cancer preventive
effects of nimbolide were observed in several animal
studies [11-13], thereby providing strong evidence to
support its further development as a therapeutic agent
against cancer. In accordance with the drug development
pipeline [14], nimbolide is now at the stage of preclinical
pharmacological investigation, where pharmacodynamics
(PD), toxicology, and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies
should be performed before the drug can proceed to
the clinical testing phase. Although the development of
various separation techniques [15-18] has facilitated a
highly efficient extraction of nimbolide for use in many
in vitro experiments to elucidate its potential therapeutic
actions, the absence of information on its absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME), as
well as its toxicity, in turn hampers further clinical studies
on this natural compound. Therefore, research on its PK
characteristics and toxicological profile should be carried
out to facilitate and accelerate its development as an
anticancer drug candidate for clinical trials. The objectives
of the present review are to summarize the current status
of nimbolideas a chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic
agent in specific cancer types based on pre-clinical studies,
as well as to highlight the importance of performing

toxicological and PK studies that will lay the foundation
for its early-phase clinical investigation.

METHODOLOGY
Web of Science and Google scholar database
searches were conducted during August -September
2015 to identify and retrieve articles related to nimbolide
and its derivatives. Search terms included “nimbolide”,
”neem”, “Azadirachtaindica “and” nimbolide derivatives”.
The Boolean operator ‘OR’ was placed between each of
the search words. The reference list of each article was
analysed in detail to identify additional relevant articles.
The reviewer read each article in full text (n=70),
evaluated its relevance and recorded the findings in a
table. The table included a summary of each article’s
content and its relevance on a scale rating (not relevant,
relevant, very relevant). The “relevant” and “very
relevant” articles (n=55) were further reviewed to identify
key pharmacodynamic properties of nimbolide.

Figure 1: A schematic illustration of the molecular mechanisms of the anticancer action of nimbolide [38]. Nimbolide

induces apoptosis through diverse molecular mechanism(s). Nimbolide disrupts MOMP, which promotes caspases activation leading to
apoptosis. Nimbolide also reduces the level of CDKs and cyclins, causing cell cycle arrest. Nimbolide also abrogates various signaling
cascades including MAPK (ERK1/2), JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt, leading to suppression of proliferation of a wide variety of human
cancer cells. Nimbolide disrupts the Nrf2-KEAP1 complex and promotes the release of Nrf2, thus increasing levels of antioxidant and
detoxification enzymes. Nimbolide suppresses IκBα degradation and prevents nuclear translocation of p65, therefore repressing the
expression of various genes involved in cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway
also reduces the dissociation of GSK-3β from β-catenin, hence restraining the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. →: activate/induce; Long

its cytotoxicity [15]. Furthermore, structural modifications
of nimbolide to various amide derivatives have conferred
improved cytotoxicity. In 2006, Sastry et al. reported
that two of the nimbolide derivatives possessed stronger
inhibitory activities than nimbolide against six cancer cell
lines, namely, HT-29 (colon), SW-620 (colon), HOP-62
(lung), A-549 (lung), PC-3 (prostate), and OVCAR-5
(ovary) [21].

The molecular formula of nimbolide [systematic
name: (4alpha, 5alpha, 6alpha, 7alpha, 15beta,
17alpha)-7,15:21, 23-diepoxy-6-hydroxy-4,8-dimethyl1-oxo-18,24-dinor-11,12-secochola-2,13,20,22-tetraene4,11-dicarboxylic acid gamma-lactone methyl ester],
is C27H30O7 [19]. Nimbolide has a decalinskeleton [20]
and belongs to a group of tetranortriterpenoids called
C-secoMeliacins [2]. The 2D chemical structure of
nimbolide is illustrated in Figure 2.
Nimbolide was first extracted from fresh leaves of
a Nigerian sample of A.indicaby using petroleum spirit.
Nimbolide has molecular mass 466, melting point 2452470C and optical rotation of [a]D+2060. Its infrared
radiation (IR) spectrum shows carbonyl absorptions at
1665 (cyclohexenone), 1720 (CO2CH3) and 1770cm1
(γ-lactone) [17]. Using this method, nimbolide was
obtained as colorless plates following crystallization from
acetone [15]. Another method of nimbolide isolation by
column chromatography from crude extract of A.indicah
as also been reported [16].
The significant cell cytotoxicity and anticancer
effect of nimbolide was most likely due to the presence of
anα, β-unsaturated ketone structural element. In addition,
a γ-lactone moiety was also reported to be responsible for

ANTI-CANCER ACTIVITIES
Various PD studies of nimbolide on different cancer
types have been conducted. There is strong evidence to
support its activity against a wide range of malignancies
from in vitro studies and in vivo animal models.

In vitro studies
Nimbolide has been shown to exhibit anticancer
effects on a variety of cancer cell lines through disturbing
the cell cycle of cancer cells. For instance, in human
colon cancer cells, nimbolide induced cell cycle arrest
and abrogated cell growth [22]. Nimbolide also exerted
a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer
(HT-29) cellsdue to cell cycle arrest. In another study [23],

In vivo studies

showed that nimbolide treatment (1–2.5 μM) resulted in
cell cycle disruption by decreasing the number of cells in
G0/G1 phase. Besides these, the anti-proliferation effect
on cancer cells was also evident by the reduction of Ki-67
protein [24] in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (a type of
B lymphocyte cancer) [11] and glioblastoma multiforme
[12].
More importantly, nimbolide showed a strong
apoptotic effect on cancer cells. It also has an inhibitory
role on metastasis and angiogenesis of cancer cells. For
example, nimbolide treatment resulted in 50% inhibition
of the prostate cancer PC-3 cell line at a concentration of
2µM. This was accompanied by the induction of cellular
apoptosis [25]. Similarly, nimbolide was shown to induce
apoptosis in human osteocarcinoma [26], Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia (WM) [11], human cervical cancer
[27], and hepatocarcinoma cells [28]. Additionally, an in
vitro study further indicated that nimbolide was able to
combat metastasis and angiogenesis of cancer cells [29].
For instance, nimbolide have been shown to effectively
decrease breast cancer cell invasion and migration via the
transwell invasion and wound healing assays [30].
In order to comprehensively analyze the
anticancer activity of nimbolide, the half inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) of nimbolide in different cancer
types were compared, ranked, and presented in Table
1. The IC50values for various cancer types tested range
between 0.2 to 15 μM. WM emerged as the best target
for nimbolide with the lowest IC50value, which was in the
nanomolar range. Since nimbolide showed remarkable
potency against WM, the development and research of
nimbolide as potential drug candidate for WM should be
prioritized. In addition, nimbolide has also been found to
be quite effective against leukemia, choriocarcinoma and
colon cancer, with IC50values slightly above 1 μM [22, 23,
31]. Further investigation on these 3 cancer types is also
warranted.

Reference

Beside in vitro investigations, in vivo studies have
been performed on the preclinical effect of nimbolide
against colorectal, lymphoma, andbrain cancers. Firstly,
nimbolide was shown to possess a dose-dependent
anticancer effect on colorectal cancer. When nimbolide
was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 10 days at a dose
of 5mg/kg, a 67% reduction in the volume of colorectal
cancer xenografts in mice was observed. At a higher dose
of 20 mg/kg, an even more substantial and remarkable
90% reduction in tumour volume was achieved [13]. This
was further accompanied by inhibition of angiogenesis
and tumour metastasis, there by highlighting the promising
activity of nimbolide against this cancer.
However, incongruency between the anticancer
potency of nimbolide between in vivo doses and in vitro
IC50 has been reported. In a WM tumour xenografted
mouse study [11], Chitta et al. reported that nimbolide
was only effective against WM tumours at very high
doses of 100-200 mg/kg, i.p. after 26days of treatment.
These doses arehowever very close to the previously
reported median lethal dose (LD50) of nimbolide(280 mg/
kg) in adult female mice [32]. Hence, we can conclude
that nimbolide has very weak anticancer activity against
WM tumours in vivo despite its high sensitivity (IC50 =
0.2 μM) against WM cellsi n vitro. In contrast to the high
doses used in WM study, significantly lower doses (520 mg/kg) were administered via the same i.p.route in a
colorectal cancer study. Here, a good anticancer effect was
achieved although nimbolide was less potent in colorectal
cancer cells (IC50 = 1.25 μM). Likewise, in another study
on glioblastoma multiforme, nimbolide was very potent
on brain tumour in vivo at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg via
intravenous (i.v.) injection for 7 days, while glioblastoma
cells has been found to be much less sensitive to
44793

nimbolide, with a relatively high in vitro IC50 (3 μM) [12].
Hence, systematic PK studies need to be carried out to
establish the relationship between the in vivo doses and the
maximum achievable concentrations in blood and tumour
site, which can help to elucidate the gap between the in
vitro and in vivo findings.

retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which in turn downregulated
the expression of cyclin E, resulting in cell cycle arrest at
G1/S and suppressionof glioblastoma growth [12].
Apart from G1/S phasearrest,nimbolidealso caused
cell cycle arrest at both the G0/G1 and G2/M phases. For
instance, nimbolide significantly suppressed the viability
of HeLa cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase
accompanied by p53-dependent p21 accumulation and
downregulation of cyclin B as well as cyclin D1 [27].
In nimbolide-treated HT-29 colorectal cancer cells, a
substantial downregulationG2/M cell cycle checkpoint
proteins, CHK2 and Rad17 were noted [38]. Taken
together, nimbolide exhibited inhibitory activity on several
CDK/cyclin molecules, there by resulting in cell cycle
arrest.

CHEMOPREVENTIVE EFFECT:
In addition to its anticancer effect, nimbolide
showed remarkable chemopreventive property. A
chemopreventive agent perturbs various steps in cancer
initiation, promotion, and progression. For instance,
chemopreventive agents hinder tumour initiation by
preventing interaction between carcinogens or reactive
free radicals and DNA, hence lowering the chance of
DNA damage and mutations [33]. Nimbolide acts as an
effective chemopreventive agent since it modulates the
biotransformation of carcinogens. Carcinogens upon
entering the body are either activated or deactivated by
xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes [34-36], which will
be elaborated in the next section. The chemo preventive
effects of nimbolide were reported in an in vivo study
using 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced
hamster buccal pouch (HBP) carcino genesis as a model
[7]. In this study, upon oral administration of 0.01 mg/
kg of nimbolide for 14 weeks, nimbolide reduced the
incidence of tumour and pre-neoplastic lesions, there
by highlighting its potent chemopreventive activity and
potential as a candidate for cancer prevention.

Induction of apoptosis
Nimbolide can induce apoptosis in cancer cells by
modulation of apoptotic proteins via both intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways of apoptosis [40].The intrinsic pathway
is a mitochondria-mediated pathway while the extrinsic
pathway is mediated by death receptors (DR).
In the intrinsic pathway, the death signal triggers
mitochondria to activate Bax, which forms holes in the
outer membrane, facilitating the release of cytochrome
c [41]. Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 to form
the apoptosome, which activates initiator caspase-9.
Caspase-9 in turn activates effector caspase-3, which
causes fragmentation of the nucleus, disruption of the
cytoskeleton, membrane blebbing, and cellfragmentation
[42]. Antiapoptotic proteins and proapoptotic proteins
regulate the level of activation of caspase-3. Nimbolide
treatmentdecreased the expression of antiapoptotic
proteins(Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, survivin, caspase inhibitor
molecules) and increased the expression of proapoptotic
proteins (cytochrome c, Bax, Bad, Bid, cleaved caspases)
in prostate cancer cells [25].
Moreover, a variety of signaling pathways regulate
apoptosis by controlling the expression or activity of
proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family [43]. Activation
of the tumor suppressor p53, for example,can induce
programmed cell death. Cytosolic p53 can in turn inhibit
anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and promote cytochrome c release.
Using this mechanism, nimbolide acted by up-regulation
of p53 levelin HeLa cells, thereby priming these cells
towards apoptosis by destabilizing the mitochondria [44,
45].
In the extrinsic pathway, extracellular death
signals such as death ligand, Fas ligand, tumour
necrosis factor (TNF), and TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand(TRAIL) bind to death receptors (DRs),
which activates caspase-8 [46-48]. Caspase-8 activates
caspase-3, leading to apoptosis. Nimbolide up-regulated
the expression of both DR5 and DR4 in chronic myeloid

MECHANISM OF ACTIONS
The major anticancer activities and cancer
preventive effect of nimbolideare depicted in Figure 2.

Inhibition of cell growth and proliferation
Cell growth and proliferation are mediated by
progression through cell cycle, which is tightly regulated
by a group of proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDKs). CDKs bind to a regulatory protein called cyclin
to form an activated complex, which drives the transition
of cells from one phase to another [37].
Nimbolide caused cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase.
Evidently, nimbolide was found to reduce cyclin A level,
which is required for colon cancer cells to proceed through
S phase, hence inducing cell cycle arrest and resulting
ininhibition of cell growth [22]. Similarly, nimbolide also
reduced the expression of CDK2/cyclin E complex and
increased the level of cyclin D2, thereby preventing colon
cancer cells from entering the S phase of the cell cycle [3739]. In addition, nimbolide directly inhibited CDK4/CDK6
kinase activity, leading to hypophosphorylation of the

leukemia (KBM-5), multiple myeloma (U266), embryonic
kidney carcinoma (A293), pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(AsPC-1), and breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231)
cells, resulting in activation of the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway [49].
Moreover, for DRs up-regulation by nimbolide,
activation of ERK and p38 MAPK were required. In
nimbolide-treated colorectal cancer cells, apoptosis
proceed by activation of caspase3/9 and ERK1/2 in the
MAPK signaling pathway [49]. Furthermore, nimbolide
resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
which are required for ERK activation, which in turn upregulated DRs and triggered apoptosis via the extrinsic
pathway [27, 31]. ROS also induced lipid peroxidation of
cellular membranes, generating toxic metabolites such as
malondialdehyde (MDA) that can react with DNA to form
adducts to induce apoptosis.
Nimbolidecan potentiate apoptosis induced by
TNF-α in human leukemia cells [50]. Tumour necrosis
factor (TNF-α) is a multifunctional inflammatory cytokine
that also induces apoptosis of cancer cells via the extrinsic
pathway [51]. Apart from its own antitumour effects,
nimbolde can sensitize cancer cells to the effects of
other anti-cancer agents such as TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) [49]. In MCF-7 breast cancer
cells, nimbolide and TRAIL were minimally effective in
inducing apoptosis as single agents. However, when used
in combination, significant apoptosis was observed in
these cells, thereby extending the therapeutic efficacy of
both agents. More importantly, this combination showed
selectivity for cancer cells, as it was unable to evoke
similar apoptosis in normal breast cells.
Another signaling cascade that nimbolide targets
to decrease proliferation and enhance apoptosis of
cancer cells is the Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF-1)
pathway. IGF-I receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase that
can activate two different downstream effector cascades.
Under the first scenario, Ras, Raf and mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPKs) are activated, resulting in the
transcription of genes that promote sustained proliferation
[52]. In the second case, phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Aktis constitutively activated, which can regulate
cellular survival and antiapoptotic signaling events [53].
Nimbolide was found to significantly inhibit IGF-1mediated PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling in human MCF7 breast cancer cells, thereby inducing apoptosis and
inhibiting proliferation of these cells [54].
Nimbolide can also act on a deregulated nuclear
factor kappa-B(NF-κB) oncogenic pathway. NF-κB
is a pro-inflammtory transcription factor involved in
carcinogenesis, oncogenic progression, and apoptosis
evasion [55]. NF-κB is inactivated in the cytoplasm by
interacting with inhibitory Iκβ proteins such as IKKα
and IKKβ [56]. This interaction results in the inactive
NF-κB complex being primarily in the cytoplasm due
to a strong nuclear export signal in Iκβ. In many cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells, NF-κB is constitutively active and located in the
nucleus due to incessant stimulation of the IKK pathway
that degrades Iκβ, while in some other cases, the Iκβ gene
is mutated and dysfunctional [57-60]. As a result, NFκB can enter the nucleus and promote the expression of
multiple genes involved in tumor initiation, promotion
and progression [56, 61]. Nimbolide was found to inhibit
IκB degradation and prevent nuclear translocation of
NF-κB. This subsequently caused cell cycle arrest by
downregulating numerous genes involved in cellular
proliferation [62]. Nimbolide can induce apoptosis
through inactivation of NF-κB. This led to significant
suppression of Bcl-2 with concomitant increase in the
expression of Bax, cytochromec, and Smac/DIABLO
[28]. Furthermore, nimbolide attenuated the NF-κB
mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in HepG2
cells. Wnt is a family of glycoproteins that regulates the
amount of the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin that
controls key developmental gene expression programs
during embryonic development and tissue homeostasis.
Hence, mutations in the Wnt pathway correlate to human
birth defects and cancer [63]. Abrogation of NF-κB and
Wnt signaling by nimbolide stimulatedcaspase-mediated
apoptosis in HepG2 cells [28]. Unpublished data from
our group also indicate that nimbolide can substantially
abrogate the activation of another important oncogenic
transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) in diverse prostate cancer cells.
This effect was found to be mediated via an increased
production of reactive oxygen species due to GSH/GSSG
imbalance. 

Reduction in tumor metastasisandangiogenesis:
Tumour metastasis accounts for approximately 90%
of all cancer-related deaths [64]. The cancer cells from
the primary site migrate to other organs via either the
blood stream (haematogenous spread) or the lymphatic
system (lymphatic spread), and form new tumours at the
secondary sites [65].The role of matrix metallo proteinases
(MMP) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in
matrix degradation and tumour invasion has been well
studied [66-68]. MMP and uPA are regulated by tissue
inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP) [69].
Nimbolide
reducedphorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate(PMA)-induced tumor cell migration and
invasion by inhibition of MMP via NF-κB [22]. The
downregulation of proinvasive and angiogenic proteins,
with up-regulationof their inhibitors by nimbolide that was
observed in this study was in line with the anti-invasive
and anti-angiogenic potential of neem preparations [70]. In
addition, nimbolide reduced mRNA expression of MMP2, MMP-9, uPA and uPA receptor in breast cancer cells
(MCF-7) [30].
Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand(CCL) is a proinflammatory chemokine and associates with its receptor,
44795

Oncotarget

C-C chemokine receptor type (CCR). CCL2 recruits
inflammatory leukocytes (such as tumour-associated
macrophages) in the tumour microenvironment and
facilitates cancer cell progression [71]. CXC ligand
(CXCL12) drives tumour invasion by induction of MMP9 [72]. CXCR4 is responsible for metastatic implantation
into other organs [73]. For instance, nimbolide treatment
(2, 4 μM in breast cancer MCF-7 cells) was found to
significantly reduce CCL2, CXCR4, and CXCL12 mRNA
expression compared to control cells [30].Similarly,
nimbolide was shown to downregulate the expression
of MMP-9, ICAM-1, and CXCR4 in colorectal cancer
xenografts in a nude mouse model [13].
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a
pro-angiogenic factor that can be activated by hypoxiainducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) [74, 75]. Phosphorylated
epidermal growth factor receptor (pEGFR) isalso
associated with increased angiogenesis in breast cancer
[76]. Nimbolide down-regulated expression of both
pEGFR and VEGF receptors in breast cancer cells.
Moreover, CXCL8 or interleukin-8, a pro-angiogenic
chemokine, can stimulate both endothelial cell
proliferation and migration through CXCR2 as well as
enhance VEGF production [73, 77]. Evidently, nimbolide
also reduced expression of CXCL8 and CXCR2 in breast
cancers, and thus abrogated angiogenesis [30].

due to poor pharmacokinetic properties. Waring et al.
(2015) reported that pharmacokinetics and bioavailability
remained the third most common cause of attrition,
accounting for 16% of failuresof compounds in Phase
I trials, among a set of 605 terminated drug candidates
developed by 4 major pharmaceutical companies from
2000 to 2010 [79]. For instance, resveratrol, a promising
antiaging and anticancer drug candidatederived from
grapes, has poor bioavailability despite having favourable
in vitro data, thus limiting its use in clinical studies [80].
Oral bioavailability is a key factor to ensure an
effective drug concentration is physiologically achievable.
PK studies can evaluatethe bioavailability of a drug,
which is vital for optimizing the administration route
and schedule to achieve therapeutic efficacy [81]. In an
in vivo study of nimbolidein colorectal cancer, plasma
levels of 222 and 409ng/mL were detected in colorectal
cancer xenografted mice 2h after treatment with nimbolide
at 5 and 20 mg/kg i.p., respectively. Nimbolide levels of
345 and 868 ng/g of tumor tissue were obtained from
the mice treated with nimbolide at 5 and 20 mg/kg i.p.,
respectively. The concentrations of plasma and tumour
tissue samples were analyzed using high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) [13]. However, this HPLC
method for determination of nimbolide in mouse plasma
and tissue has not been fully validated according to the US
Food Drug Adminsitration (FDA) guidelines [82].
Distribution of nimbolide within solid tumours and
normal tissues is also an important parameter that requires
investigation. During the in vivo study of nimbolide
in glioblastomamultiforme, where brain tumour cells
were xenografted either by injection at the flank or into
the cerebral cortex, the tumour volumes of nimbolide
treatment group were about 40% smaller than those of
DMSO control group [12]. The favourable PD results
indicated that nimbolide might be able to cross bloodbrain barrier (BBB) and the concentration could be
sufficient for nimbolide to suppress intracranial tumour
cell proliferation. Therefore, in vivo PK studies focused on
BBB permeability should be carried out to assess bloodbrain cerebrospinal fluid and blood-brain extracellular
fluid drug concentration relationships, in relation to
variation in drug doses and plasma drug levels [83].
More crucially, metabolite evaluation is essential
for nimbolide because many natural products are prodrugs that must undergo metabolic conversion either by
the intestinal microflora or mammalian phase I and/or II
metabolism before becoming an active metabolite [84].
For instance, Romidepsin (Istodax), isolated fromthe
fermentation extract of the rod-shaped bacterium C.
violaceum, is a prodrug that is converted in cells to its
active form by the reduction of the disulfide bond by
glutathione. FDA has approved Romidepsin in 2009 to
treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [85]. It was reported that
nimbolide is a CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 inhibitor as well
as a phase II enzymes inducer [7], but more studies need

I carcinogen activation enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1) and
simultaneously induce phase II carcinogen detoxification
enzymes
(glutathione-S-transferase
(GST)
and
quinonereductase (QR) [7, 13, 62, 78]. Besides modulation
of xenobiotics-metabolizing enzymes, nimbolide also
upregulates cellular antioxidant content, which aids in
decreasing carcinogen-induced oxidative DNA damage, a
potentially critical event in neoplastic transformation. In
another in vivo study withnimbolide in the DMBA-painted
buccal pouch of hamster, nimbolidetreatment increased
the levels of various antioxidant enzymes (glutathione
peroxidase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, superoxide
dismutase, and catalase) compared to control group [7].

IMPORTANCE OF PK STUDIES
Although accumulating evidence from in vitro and
in vivostudes indicated that nimbolide exerts multiple
pharmacological effects (antioxidant and anticancer
effects), clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of
nimbolideas an anticancer drughave not been conducted.
The main reason for this is most likely due to the lack of
preclinical PK parameters (ADME) of nimbolide. Most
natural drug candidates fail to advance in clinical studies

to be carried out to determine whether nimbolide has any
active metabolite.
To sum up, the bioavailability evaluation of
nimbolidebecomesmore critical ifnimbolideis chosen
to be developedas a commercial drug for cancer
prevention, in which oral administration is required.
PK studies performed with robust and sensitive bioanalytical methods allow us to identify ADME constraints
and better understand the bioavailability and other
important PK parameters of nimbolide, such as the Cmax
(maximum concentration), Tmax (time to reach maximum
concentration), t1/2 (elimination half-life), clearance,
volume of distribution, and dose linearity/proportionality
[86]. So far, there are no systematic studies that have been
done to investigate these PK properties of nimbolide.
Therefore, the following aspects are urgently needed
in getting nimbolide into the clinic. These include i)
developing and validating a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS
method for determination of nimbolid econcentrations
in plasma and tissue samples; ii) performing preclinical
PK studies in mice (rodent model), and monkeys (nonrodent model) to define optimized dosage, formulation,
and treatment schedule. Based on these preclinical PK
parameters, a well-designed phase I clinical trial can be
conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
nimbolide and response in cancer patients.

STUDIES

STATUS

ON

(i.m.), with LD50 exceeds 600mg/kg body weight [17].
All the above-mentioned toxicological results need to be
interpreted based on PK properties of nimbolide,which
are currently absent. Hence, a systematic PK study is
warranted to determine PK parameters of nimbolide and
its metabolite profile.
Furthermore, the spermicidal effect of nimbolide in
animals is still inconclusive. In an in vitro study, nimbolide
had no significant effect on the viability of rabbit sperm
[10]. Upon exposure to nimbolide at 50 μM for 60 min,
there was only 20-30% reduction in mobility and viability
of the rabbit sperm. However, in another in vivo study,
nimbolide, when administered subcutaneously at dose 0.51.5 mg/kg to Wistar strain male albino rats, was shown to
reduce sperm functional parameters and increase abnormal
sperm countin a dose-dependent manner [87]. This result
was supported by the in vitro study carried out by the
same research group. In this study, 0.5-2 μM of nimbolide
was able to deplete the antioxidant defense system in
sperm of Wistar strain male albino rats by decreasing
activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase, GR,
GPx); hence increasing the level of production of ROS
and inducing oxidative stress in epididymal sperm of rats
[88]. With respect to mutagenicity, nimbolide possessed
no mutagenic effectusing six tester strains of Salmonella
typhimurium [4, 89].
Although toxicity was significantly reduced when
nimbolide was administered i.g., s.c. and i.m., the systemic
exposure with repeated doses of nimbolide (repeated-dose
toxicity studies) should be thoroughly investigated to
identify the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in
the most appropriate animal species. According to FDA,
both a rodent (rat or mouse) and a non-rodent (dog or
monkey) general toxicity study of at least 14 days should
be conducted [90]. The preclinical data including doseresponse relationship, pharmacokinetics and toxicological
profile are important for determination of the starting dose
in first-in-human studies [90].

TOXICITY

While PK is a vital part of drug development,
preclinical safety/toxicity testing is very important for
the development of new drugs;especially in anticancer
drugs,since efficacy does not guarantee non-toxicity.
During the period from 2000 to 2010, out of 808 drug
candidates developed by 4 major pharmaceutical
companies, 356 compounds (44%) failed to progress
into clinical studies due to toxicity. Preclinical toxicity
was the highest cause of attrition accounting for 59% of
the failure at the preclinical phase [79]. Hence, the high
toxicity-based attrition further highlights the importance of
toxicological studies in drug development. In this section,
acute toxicity, mutagenicity, and spermicidal effects of
nimbolide will be discussed.
The toxicity of nimbolide in human has not been
studied. However, nimbolide exhibited acute toxicity in
mice, hamster and rats. Nimbolide was more toxic to mice
when given i.p.and i.v. at same doses, compared to rats and
hamsters. Moreover, in adult male mice, the median lethal
dose (LD50) of i.p. route was 225mg/kg, while LD50of
i.v. was 24mg/kg body weight, 10 times more toxic than
i.p.route. The higher toxicity for i.v.mightbe due to higher
peak concentration(Cmax) compared to i.p., which has
an absorption phase. The toxicity of nimbolide in mice
is markedly reduced when administered intragastrically/
orally (i.g.), subcutaneously (s.c) and intramuscularly

CONCLUSION
PROSPECTS

AND

FUTURE

Nimbolide has been used in traditional Indian
medicine to treat various diseases such as infections,
gastric ulcers, and cancer. Accumulating evidence from
in vitro and in vivo studies supports the anticancer and
chemopreventive properties of nimbolide in many cancer
types including WM, colon, and brain cancer. Multiple
mechanisms of action for nimbolide’s anticancer and
chemopreventive effects have been proposed based on its
molecular targets identified in several types of cancer. The
main anticancer mechanisms of action ofnimbolide include
anti-proliferation, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of
angiogenesis and migration, as well as suppression of
tumourigenesis via modulation of carcinogen metabolizing
enzymes. Compared to the great number of in vitro
44797

Oncotarget

studies that have been conducted, more efforts should be
spent on performing in vivo studies to verify the in vitro
findings.In addition, there is a contradiction between in
vitro concentration and in vivo dose in certain types of
cancer. Therefore systematic PK evaluationsare urgently
required to interpret the inconsistency between in vitro and
in vivo results.To the best of our knowledge, a sensitive
bio-analytical method to determine the effective plasma
and intracellular concentrations of nimbolide is currently
lacking, which is the main obstacle to understanding
nimbolide’s biologically relevant concentrations in animal
models. Furthermore, comprehensive toxicological studies
should be conducted to support the safety of nimbolide
in animal models including the non-rodent species.Taken
together, nimbolide has demonstrated anticancer and
chemopreventive effects on many different types of cancer
in preclinical studies. Well-designed PK studies and longterm safety/toxicity investigations can greatly accelerate
its development as a potential anticancer drug candidate
in early phase clinical trials.
