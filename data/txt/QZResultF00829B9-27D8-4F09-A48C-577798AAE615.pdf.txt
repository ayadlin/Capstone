Abstract
The RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK pathway
provides numerous opportunities for targeted oncology
therapeutics. In particular, the MEK enzyme is attractive due
to high selectivity for its target ERK and the central role that
activated ERK plays in driving cell proliferation. The structural, pharmacologic, and pharmacokinetic properties of
RDEA119/BAY 869766, an allosteric MEK inhibitor, are
presented. RDEA119/BAY 869766 is selectively bound directly
to an allosteric pocket in the MEK1/2 enzymes. This compound
is highly efficacious at inhibiting cell proliferation in several
tumor cell lines in vitro. In vivo, RDEA119/BAY 869766 exhibits
potent activity in xenograft models of melanoma, colon, and
epidermal carcinoma. RDEA119/BAY 869766 exhibits complete suppression of ERK phosphorylation at fully efficacious
doses in mice. RDEA119/BAY 869766 shows a tissue selectivity
that reduces its potential for central nervous system–related
side effects. Using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
data, we show that maintaining adequate MEK inhibition
throughout the dosing interval is likely more important than
achieving high peak levels because greater efficacy was
achieved with more frequent but lower dosing. Based on its
longer half-life in humans than in mice, RDEA119/BAY 869766
has the potential for use as a once- or twice-daily oral
treatment for cancer. RDEA119/BAY 869766, an exquisitely
selective, orally available MEK inhibitor, has been selected for
clinical development because of its potency and favorable
pharmacokinetic profile. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6839–47]

Introduction
Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United
States (one of four deaths; ref. 1). Although progress is being made,
as measured by an increase in the 5-year survival rate from f50%
in the 1970s to 66% for people diagnosed with cancer between 1996
and 2002, there is still significant unmet medical need among
patients with cancer (1, 2).

The focus of much cancer drug discovery work has shifted
toward targeted therapies aimed at genes and pathways that are
dysfunctional in human cancer (3). Hyperactivation of cell
proliferation, survival, and metastasis pathways can arise from
activating gene mutations, gene amplification/overexpression, and/
or loss of endogenous tumor suppressors that normally keep these
pathways in check (4).
The RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK pathway
is constitutively activated in a significant proportion of human
tumors often through gain-of-function mutations in RAS or RAF
gene family members or through hyperactivation of upstream
receptor tyrosine kinases [e.g., epidermal growth factor (EGF)
receptor tyrosine kinase] that transduce signals through this
pathway (5). Studies of primary tumor samples and immortalized
cancer cell lines have shown constitutive activation of the
RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in several human tumors, including
lung, colon, melanoma, thyroid, and pancreatic cancer (6). BRAF
activating gene mutations are prevalent in melanoma at 66% and
thyroid cancer (44% and 24% for papillary and anaplastic thyroid
cancer, respectively; refs. 7–9).
Within this pathway lies MEK for which there are two highly
homologous genes expressed in humans (MEK1 and MEK2; ref. 10).
MEK is downstream of BRAF in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway
and is critical for transducing signals to ERK (11). BRAF activating
gene mutations have been shown to predict sensitivity to MEK
inhibition across a panel of cancer cell lines (12). This dependency,
coupled with a unique hydrophobic pocket within the MEK enzyme
that allows for the interaction of highly selective ‘‘allosteric’’
inhibitors, has made MEK an attractive cancer target (13). We
describe the structure and activity of RDEA119/BAY 869766
(referred to in this manuscript as RDEA119), an orally available,
potent, non–ATP-competitive, highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2,
which is active in human tumor xenograft models and is well
tolerated within the therapeutic exposure range in animals.

Materials and Methods
The chemical name of RDEA119 is (R)-N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cyclopropane1-sulfonamide, which was synthesized at Ardea Biosciences (Fig. 1A).
PD0325901 (0494611 L0002): (S)-N-(2,3-dihydroxy-propoxy)-3,4-difluoro-2(2-fluoro-4-iodo-phenylamino)-benzamide can be obtained from Selleck
Chemicals Co. Ltd.
Preparation and purification of MEK1 for structural studies. A
MEK1 cDNA expression construct coding for an NH2-terminal truncation,
MEK1D61 (residues 62–393 wild-type truncated form), was cloned into
a bacterial expression vector as pET24b-MEK1D61 using NdeI/XhoI sites
(10). The COOH-terminal His6-tag construct was grown at 37jC to an
A 600 of 1.0 and then lowered to 16jC and induced with 3.25 mmol/L
isopropyl-L-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside, grown 20 to 24 h as described (10).

Protein-ligand ternary complex formation and cocrystallization.
RDEA119 (0.8 AL; 500 mmol/L in 100% DMSO) was added to 0.5 mL of
MEK1D61 (3 mg/mL) and incubated overnight at 4jC, then brought to
5 mmol/L Mg-ATP and incubated 5 h at 4jC, concentrated, and mixed 1:1 with
crystallization reservoir solution [250 mmol/L NH4H2PO4, 6% (w/v) PEG 8000,
100 mmol/L malate, 10 mmol/L imidazole], and the drop was allowed to
equilibrate over 1 mL of reservoir solution using the hanging drop vapor
diffusion technique at 13jC. Frozen MEK1D61/RDEA119 cocrystals have
unit cell dimensions of a = 82.3 Å, b = 82.3 Å, c = 129.8 Å, a = 90j, b = 90j, and
c = 120j and belong to the hexagonal space group P62.
Data collection and structure determination. A frozen MEK1D61/
RDEA119 crystal was mounted on an X-ray diffraction system consisting of
a RUH3R X-ray generator and a RAXIS IV++ image plate area detector
(Rigaku/MSC). A data set of 2.5 Å resolution was collected using 0.5j
oscillations and a total $-rotation of 65j and processed, scaled, and reduced
(14). The three-dimensional coordinates of only the MEK1 protein atoms
from Protein Data Bank entry, 1S9J, were used as the phasing model using
the program CNX (15). The initial model was refined against the data
initially by treating the MEK1 peptide as a rigid body. Additional rounds of
torsion angle annealing and manual adjustment to the model revealed
strong difference density for one molecule of ATP, one magnesium ion, and

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

RDEA119. Ligand atoms were added to the model accordingly and included
in further rounds of refinement. The final R factor is 21.9% for the model,
which includes MEK1 residues (62–222, 224–275, and 306–382), one
molecule of ATP, one magnesium ion, 65 water molecules, and the inhibitor
RDEA119. Coordinates and structural factors have been deposited into
protein data bank,1 with PDB code 3E8N.
Biochemical kinase assays. The human MEK1 enzyme was purchased
from Invitrogen. The active human MEK2 and truncated RAF1 enzyme were
purchased from Millipore. Kinase inactive murine ERK2 (mERK2) K52A/
T183A was affinity purified from Escherichia coli expressed using the pET21a
vector. MEK1 kinase activity was determined using mERK2 K52A T183A as
the substrate. Recombinant MEK1 enzyme (5 nmol/L) was first activated by
0.02 unit or 1.5 nmol/L of RAF1 in the presence of 25 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.8),
1 mmol/L MgCl2, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, and 50 Amol/L ATP for
30 min at 25jC. The reactions were initiated by adding 2 Amol/L of mERK2
K52A T183A and 2.5 ACi [g-33P]ATP in a total volume of 20 AL. The MEK2
kinase activity was determined similarly except that activation by RAF1 was
not needed and 11 nmol/L of MEK2 enzyme (active) were used in the assays.

Efficacy of a Novel MEK1/2 Allosteric Inhibitor
Kinase profiling was performed by Invitrogen using their SelectScreen
Kinase Profiling Service. The Z’-LYTE biochemical assay was used. RDEA119
was assayed in quadruplicate at 10 Amol/L against 205 kinases.
Tumor cell lines and media. A375, SK-Mel-28, A431, Colo205, HT-29,
MDA-MB-231, and BxPC3 cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection. A375, A431, MDA-MB-231, and SK-Mel-28 cells were
grown in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids,
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. HT-29 cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10%
FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL
streptomycin. BxPC3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% FBS, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. Cells
were maintained at 37jC, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity.
Cellular MEK inhibition. A375, A431, SK-Mel-28, Colo205, HT-29,
and BxPC3 cells were plated onto 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning) at
densities of 2  104, 1.5  104, 0.75  104, 2  104, 4  104, and 2  104
per well, respectively, with their appropriate growth medium. Plates
were incubated overnight to allow cells to adhere. The diluted
compounds were added to PBS-washed cells, incubated at 37jC for 20
min in 1% FBS, washed with PBS, and stored at 70jC until further
processing.
MEK activity was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of ERK1
and ERK2 using a phospho-ERK1/2 ELISA kit (BioSource). The mean
absorbance measured at 450 nm was converted to percent activity, and
average percent activity values were determined from duplicate wells.
Cell growth inhibition assays. For anchorage-dependent growth
inhibition experiments, cells were plated in white 384-well plates at
1,000/20 AL/well or white 96-well microplates at 4,000/100 AL/well. After
24-h incubation at 37jC, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity, compound was
incubated for 48 h at 37jC and assayed using CellTiter-Glo. For the 96-well
anchorage-independent growth assay, wells of an ‘‘ultralow binding’’ plate
(Corning) were filled with 60 AL of a 0.15% agarose solution in complete
RPMI 1640. Then, 60 AL of complete RPMI 1640 containing 9,000 cells in
0.15% agarose were added per well. After 24 h, 60 AL of a 3 drug solution
in agarose-free complete RPMI 1640 were added. After 7 d, 36 AL of 6 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium, inner salt reagent (CellTiter 96 Aqueous, Promega) were
added per well. After 2 h at 37jC, absorbance at 490 nm was determined on
the M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Nonlinear curve fitting was
performed using GraphPad Prism 4.
Human tumor xenograft studies. Female athymic nude mice (nu/nu,
Harlan) were used for all the efficacy studies except for the Colo205 study
2, which used male mice. Studies were performed at Piedmont Research
Center in compliance with Association for Assessment and Accreditation
of Laboratory Animal Care standards and approved by the review board
at Piedmont Research Center. Mice were injected s.c. in the flank with
1  106 tumor cells (Colo205 and A431) or f1 mm3 tumor fragments
(A375 and HT-29). Tumor volumes were monitored by caliper measurements using the formula tumor volume (mm3) = (w 2  l)/2, where w =
width and l = length in mm of the tumor. For efficacy analysis, treatment
was initiated when tumors were 80 to 185 mm3. RDEA119 was
administered by oral gavage once daily or twice daily for 14 d or once
every 2 d for 14 doses.
Pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic studies. Mice bearing tumors
(250–350 mm3) were dosed by oral gavage with RDEA119 at 2.5, 5, 10, or 25
mg/kg, PD325901 at 10 mg/kg, or vehicle. Three mice from each group were
sacrificed at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after dosing, and plasma, brain, lung, and
tumor samples were collected and frozen. Tissue samples were thawed on
ice and homogenized in Cell Extraction Buffer (BioSource) at a 10% (v/w)
ratio for tumor and 20% (v/w) ratio for brain and lung. Homogenates were
incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 500  g for 5 min. Lysates were
transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and further clarified by centrifugation
at 14,000  g for 5 min. Lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis
probed with a mixture of phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody and p44/42
MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling). Rat pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic

studies were conducted as follows: animals from each treatment group were
sacrificed at 48 h after dose. Blood samples (f1 mL) were collected for
plasma bioanalysis of RDEA119 and PD325901 concentrations by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. Plasma supernatants were aspirated and
placed in labeled tubes and stored at 20jC until analysis. Brain and lung
samples were also collected (whole organ), weighed, and flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen for analysis of total ERK and pERK levels.
Plasma samples were analyzed for RDEA119 using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The method
involved the addition of the internal standard ([13C6]RDEA119), protein
precipitation with acetonitrile, and final analysis by high-performance
LC-MS/MS. An API 5000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to
monitor the precursor!product ion transitions of m/z 573!394 and m/z
579!400 for RDEA119 and [13C6]RDEA119 in positive electrospray ion
mode. The calibration curves covered the concentration range from 10 to
10,000 ng/mL.

Results
RDEA119 is an orally bioavailable small molecule with a
molecular weight of 572 g/mol. We conducted a variety of
preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies to determine (a) potency
against its molecular target MEK, (b) selectivity relative to other
kinases, (c) antiproliferative activity in cell culture systems using
both cancer and normal cells, (d) in vivo antitumor efficacy, (e)
pharmacokinetic relationships between antitumor efficacy and
brain retention, and ( f ) downstream consequences of MEK
inhibition on proliferation and/or apoptosis.
Interaction between RDEA119 and the MEK enzyme: X-ray
cocrystal structure. RDEA119 potently inhibited MEK activity in
enzyme inhibition assays in a non–ATP-competitive manner
(MEK1 IC50 = 19 nmol/L, MEK2 IC50 = 47 nmol/L) determined
through incorporation of radioactive phosphate from ATP into
ERK as substrate.
To determine the mechanism of inhibition of RDEA119, we
cocrystallized RDEA119 with a truncated version of MEK1 that was
amenable to crystallization (10). The RDEA119-MEK complex
structure reveals that RDEA119 binds to an allosteric site adjacent
to the Mg-ATP binding region and interacts extensively with ATP,
the activation loop, and other surrounding protein residues
through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1B
and C). This interaction site is similar to the one identified for the
MEK inhibitor PD-318088 (PDB ID: 1S9J; ref. 10). Notably, the
sulfonamide moiety hydrogen bonds with the basic side chain of
the Lys97, a conserved residue believed to be important for the
catalytic activity of protein kinases. The iodine is in electrostatic
interaction with backbone C = O of Val127, whereas one of the two
fluorines is involved in hydrogen bonding with NH of Ser212. This
inhibitor also forms several contacts to Asp208, Phe209, and Gly210,
also known as the DFG motif that is shared across several families
of protein kinases. The diol extension of RDEA119 interacts heavily
with oxygen atoms of the a and g phosphate groups of the ATP
cofactor, whereas the cyclopropyl of RDEA119 forms contacts with
the side chain of Met219. RDEA119 is also engaged in hydrophobic
contacts with side chains of residues Ile99, Leu115, Leu118, Phe129,
Ile141, Met143, Asp190, Cys207, Asp208, Phe209, Gly210, Val211, Ser212,
Leu215, and Ile216. In addition, unlike PD0325901, RDEA119 has a
unique cyclopropyl group that is in direct hydrophobic contacts
with the side chain of Met219 in the A-loop, further stabilizing it in
the closed ‘‘active’’ conformation of the enzyme. Such a binding
mode thus suggests a noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition
of RDEA119 against MEK1, which allows ATP binding but

precludes binding to the substrate ERK, thus preventing ERK
phosphorylation (10).
RDEA119 significantly inhibits only MEK1/2 relative to 205 other
kinases in a multikinase screen (data not shown). MEK1 and MEK2
were inhibited 97% and 99%, respectively, when tested at 10 Amol/L.
Four other kinases (BRAF, BRAF V599E, COT, and RAF1) showed
inhibition of >90%; however, these used MEK1 in a cascade assay
format and the inhibition in these assays is due to MEK1 inhibition rather than direct inhibition of the other kinases by RDEA119.
The kinase-specific assay conditions use a cascade format that has
RAF1/MEK/ERK all together in the assay, which phosphorylate an
ERK substrate. Therefore, a MEK inhibitor will be flagged as a
RAF1 inhibitor in this assay due to reduction of the ERK-specific
peptide.
Cellular MEK potency. RDEA119 potently inhibited MEK
activity as measured by phosphorylation of ERK1/2 across several
human cancer cell lines of different tissue origins and BRAF
mutational status with EC50 values ranging from 2.5 to 15.8 nmol/L
(Table 1A). RDEA119 was significantly bound by human serum
albumin (hSA) in these assays as shown by 10- to 30-fold loss of
potency in the presence of 1% FBS + 45 mg/mL hSA compared with
1% FBS alone (Table 1A). hSA (45 mg/mL) is the midpoint of the
normal serum albumin range in human serum (35–55 mg/mL).
Mouse and human plasma protein binding of RDEA119 is 99.6%
and 99.8%, respectively (data not shown). These results speak to the
availability of the compound in plasma and may affect the activity
of a compound in vivo; thus, potency in a high protein environment
is reduced, but this effect is likely small in humans. The species
binding data points towards a smaller free fraction of compound in
mouse models, which in turn may underestimate the potency of
RDEA119 in man.
Growth inhibition potency and effect of BRAF status.
RDEA119 inhibited anchorage-dependent growth of human cancer
cell lines harboring the gain-of-function V600E BRAF mutant with
GI50 values ranging from 67 to 89 nmol/L (Table 1A). In contrast,
RDEA119 had significantly less growth-inhibitory potency against
cell lines with wild-type BRAF (A431 cells) or MDA-MB-231 cells
harboring a BRAF mutation G464V that shows minimal (<2-fold
increase) enhancement of inherent kinase activity (Table 1A;
ref. 16). Interestingly, under anchorage-independent conditions,
GI50 values for all cell lines tested were similar (40–84 nmol/L;
Table 1A). MDA-MB-231 and A431 cells were significantly more
sensitive to RDEA119 under anchorage-independent conditions,
suggesting increased dependence on the MEK pathway. These
concentrations of RDEA119 had minimal or no effect on the
growth of primary human hepatocytes or human renal proximal
tubule epithelial cells (data not shown). Inhibition of A375 cell
proliferation by RDEA119 was primarily accounted for by cell cycle
arrest rather than apoptosis for two reasons: (a) cellular membrane
integrity (assessed by adenylate kinase release) was minimally
affected by drug treatment (data not shown) and (b) flow
cytometry revealed a G1-phase cell cycle arrest with little if any
sub-G1 population (Supplementary Data).
Antitumor efficacy of RDEA119 in multiple human tumor
xenograft models. The human melanoma A375 tumor xenograft
was found to be sensitive to RDEA119 treatment (Table 1B; Fig. 2A)
with 54% and 68% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) seen with 25 and
50 mg/kg/d administered orally on a once daily  14 schedule.
Significant tumor growth delay (TGD) and regressions were also
observed in A375 tumors on this once-daily schedule. For example,
five to eight complete or partial responses (CR/PR) and up to six

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

tumor-free survivors (TFS) were observed (Table 1B). We also
observed a schedule-dependent antitumor efficacy profile for
RDEA119 in A375 tumor xenografts. For example, administering
RDEA119 every other day at 100 mg/kg was less effective than daily
dosing with either 25 or 50 mg/kg (Table 1B). Interestingly, when
RDEA119 was dosed on a twice-daily schedule, it was more
effective than once-daily schedules (Table 1B; Fig. 2B). This effect
correlates with C min levels as depicted in Fig. 2B. Taken together
with the observation that A375 tumors rapidly regrew after the
14-day course of treatment (data not shown), our results suggest
that continuous dosing with RDEA119 will be necessary to
maximize in vivo antitumor activity.
RDEA119 also showed potent TGI in the human colon
carcinoma Colo205 tumor xenograft. Doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg
produced marked TGI during drug treatment (e.g., 25 mg/kg TGI =
123%; Table 1B, Colo205 study 1). Note that TGI >100% occurs
when the tumor shrinks below its starting volume. Tumor
regressions were also noted with seven PRs, two CRs, and two
TFS observed within the nine animals treated with 25 mg/kg, and
nine PRs seen in the 50 mg/kg treated group. An additional study
was performed in Colo205-bearing animals to estimate an ED50
value using lower doses of RDEA119 on a once daily  14 schedule
(2.5–25 mg/kg, oral). In this experiment, we again found that
RDEA119 produced marked TGI during drug treatment (e.g., 25
mg/kg TGI = 68%; Table 1B, Colo205 study 2). The ED50 value for
TGI within this study ranged between 2.5 and 10 mg/kg for which
43% to 53% TGI was seen across these treatment arms (Table 1B).
In addition, we found that human A431 cells in which the ERK
pathway is constitutively activated due to the overexpression of the
EGF receptor (17) and human colon cancer HT-29 cells that harbor
a BRAF V600E mutation also exhibited inhibition of tumor growth
in the presence of RDEA119 (Table 1B). A dose of 25 mg/kg once
daily  14 produced 56% and 67% TGI for HT-29 and A431 tumors,
respectively. During the 14 days of oral treatment with RDEA119,
there was no significant loss in body weights across the 0 to 50 mg/kg
treated animals (data not shown).
Pharmacokinetics of RDEA119 in mice. The pharmacokinetics
of RDEA119 in mice was assessed over a 24-hour time course
following oral exposure to a single dose of 25 mg/kg. RDEA119 was
rapidly absorbed (T max = 2 hours) with a total serum C max of 9.85
Ag/mL (see Fig. 3A). The C min values at 12 and 24 hours were 1.37
and 0.03 Ag/mL, respectively. The t 1/2 of RDEA119 following oral
exposure in the mouse was 2.6 hours and the AUC0-24h was 55
(Agh/mL). We simulated the pharmacokinetics of the more
efficacious twice-daily 12.5 mg/kg oral dose of RDEA119 and
project a total serum C max of f5 Ag/mL (see Fig. 3A) with C min
values at 12 and 24 hours of 1.2 Ag/mL. In comparison, the
concentrations of RDEA119 necessary to inhibit (a) cellular pERK
in vitro was 1.4 to 9.0 ng/mL (conversion from nmol/L to ng/mL =
0.572) or (b) anchorage-independent cell proliferation in vitro was
23 to 48 ng/mL across the cancer cell lines tested in 10% FBS
(see Table 1A and B).
Pharmacokinetics/pharmcodynamics of RDEA119. The levels of pERK, a biomarker of MEK activity, were monitored over a
24-hour period in tumors, lung, and brain after a single dose of
RDEA119 or another MEK inhibitor PD325901 at multiple dose
levels. RDEA119 strongly suppressed pERK levels in Colo205
tumors for up to 12 hours compared with the vehicle-treated
group (Fig. 3B). The relationship between MEK inhibition and
plasma levels of RDEA119 is depicted in Fig. 4B. An EC50 value of
42 ng/mL (73 nmol/L) for MEK inhibition in tumors was obtained

similarly. In contrast, RDEA119 exhibits tissue selectivity, showing
little or no inhibition in brain, significantly lower effect in lung, and
sustained efficacy in tumor tissue. The levels of RDEA119 in the
lung are similar to the concentration in plasma, whereas the levels
in the brain are much lower than in the plasma, suggesting that
RDEA119 has low central nervous system (CNS) penetration. In
contrast, concentrations of PD325901 are higher in the brain than
in plasma (Fig. 4A–D).
Rat tissue samples were evaluated for pERK inhibition 48 hours
after oral dosing with RDEA119 and PD325901. MEK activity in the
brain was inhibited by PD325901 in a dose-dependent manner. No
significant inhibition of MEK was shown for RDEA119 at any dose
tested. Plasma concentrations were correlated with MEK inhibition
in brain homogenates. Figure 4 shows dose-dependent inhibition of
brain pERK levels only for PD325901, which had an EC50 value of
641 ng/mL. There was very little pERK inhibition in the brain for
RDEA119 (Fig. 4A–B).
We next compared the efficacy of the PD and RDEA compounds
in two different xenograft models (Table 2). These were a colon
cancer line, Colo205, and a melanoma line, A375. These were
tested in a standard xenograft model with oral dosing for both

compounds for 14 days. Tumor volumes were measured along with
tumor-free survival. The data are shown in tabular form for both
experiments. In both colon and melanoma models, the efficacy and
potency for each compound were similar and not significantly
different. Both compounds significantly suppressed tumor volume
in treated mice. The MEK inhibitors showed a higher number of
tumor-free survivors in both models compared with the reference
treatment.

Discussion
The attractiveness of MEK as a pharmaceutical target has been
enhanced by the discovery of highly selective non–ATP-competitive
inhibitors of MEK1/2 (18–21). Such selectivity is achieved by the
interaction of the inhibitor with a hydrophobic pocket in MEK that
interferes with subsequent binding and hydrolysis of ATP (10).
Through cocrystallization of RDEA119 with human MEK1, we have
found that RDEA119 binds in this MEK hydrophobic pocket and
blocks MEK enzymatic activity (Fig. 1).
First-generation MEK inhibitors (e.g., CI-1040) had poor exposure
in patients, preventing sustained MEK inhibition in tumor tissue

(22–24). Second-generation inhibitors (e.g., PD325901), although
significantly more potent and more water soluble, have been
hampered by side effect issues, including ocular and neurologic
toxicities, presumably due to accumulation of such agents in the
brain and other neural tissue (25). Thus, significant interest has
arisen in the field for the discovery and development of potent and
selective MEK inhibitors that lack CNS retention. As such, we
focused our efforts on designing a MEK inhibitor that retains high
potency and selectivity to MEK over other kinases and good
pharmaceutical properties (solubility, oral bioavailability, etc.) while
avoiding CNS retention compared with first-generation agents such
as PD325901.

The data described in this article show that RDEA119 is a
highly potent and selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 activity through
its interaction with MEK. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals
that RDEA119 binds to an allosteric pocket adjacent to the ATP
binding site, locking the enzyme in a catalytically inactive
conformation. When bound to MEK, RDEA119 interacts directly
with ATP, the activation loop, and other surrounding protein
residues through both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic
interactions, resulting in significant affinity for the binding
pocket. RDEA119 had preferential growth-inhibitory activity in
cancer cells harboring the BRAF gain-of-function mutation,
V600E, consistent with the activities of other MEK inhibitors

(13, 18, 26). However, this differential sensitivity was only seen in
our hands under anchorage-dependent (cell growth on plastic)
conditions. Anchorage-independent growth in a semisolid
medium showed no clear sensitivity differences in the cancer
cell lines tested. Further studies will be necessary to explain the
mechanistic basis for this differential sensitivity. However, it

seems that growth on plates reduces or bypasses the need for
MEK activity for cell proliferation in some cell lines.
The antitumor activity of RDEA119 was shown across a variety of
human tumor xenografts, including the human melanoma A375
tumor and the human colon cancer xenograft Colo205. Both
tumors express activated BRAF mutations (see Table 1A). We also

observed dosing schedule dependency in the degree of antitumor
activity observed in vivo (see Table 1B and Fig. 2), with twice-daily
dosing being more effective than less frequent dosing. Pharmacokinetic analysis of RDEA119 concentrations in the plasma of mice
was assessed from a single dose of RDEA119 (see Fig. 3A). The
twice-daily and every other day pharmacokinetics of RDEA119
were then modeled from this actual data set. Superimposition of
these pharmacokinetic profiles illustrated that the degree of
antitumor activity seen with RDEA119 in these human tumor
xenografts is more likely to correlate with maintaining plasma
levels of RDEA119 above 1,240 ng/mL ( from C min at 25 mg/kg
twice daily A375 xenograft) for 24 hours rather than high peak
levels (C max). This is consistent with findings that once RDEA119
dosing stopped, tumors rapidly regrew in mice harboring residual
tumor mass. These data suggest that continuously inhibiting MEK
activity in a patient’s tumor throughout the period between doses
will be important to achieve and sustain antitumor efficacy.
To assess the potential for brain penetration and activity, we
compared the ability of RDEA119 to inhibit pERK levels in the
brain, lung, and tumor tissues of tumor-bearing mice and found at
least that 76-fold lower plasma levels of RDEA119 were required to
inhibit 50% of the pERK level in tumor versus brain. Testing of
other MEK inhibitors, including PD325901, revealed little or no
difference in brain, tumor, and lung penetration versus plasma for
these other compounds (Figs. 3B and C and 4A–D). We have tested
mouse MEK in vitro and in vivo and see no difference in affinity or
inhibitory activity between the species (data not shown). These
experiments suggest that RDEA119 exhibits reduced potential for
brain-related side effects and may preferentially accumulate in

tumor tissue. To ensure that comparable pERK suppression in
tumors correlated with efficacy in vivo, we tested both compounds
side by side in two 14-day xenograft models. As shown in Table 2,
each compound was equally efficacious at blockade of tumor
growth at both 25 and 50 mg/kg. These data are consistent with the
pERK suppression detected in tumors from the 1-day dose
experiment for both compounds (Fig. 4) and is also consistent
with the comparable affinities for the MEK enzyme for these two
compounds. The differences noted for these molecules give further
weight to the notion that alterations in chemical structure with
similar effects on affinity can differentially affect activity in vivo.
In summary, RDEA119 is a highly potent and selective inhibitor
of MEK1/2 whose encouraging preclinical pharmacology profile
supported entry into development for the treatment of cancer.
RDEA119 is currently undergoing phase I clinical trials in late-stage
cancer patients refractory or intolerant to other anticancer
therapies.
