Abstract
Bevacizumab is one of the most widely used antiangiogenic
drugs in oncology, but the overall beneﬁcial effects of this
VEGF-A targeting agent are relatively modest, in part due to the
lack of a biomarker to select patients most likely to respond
favorably. Several molecular aberrations in cancer inﬂuence
angiogenesis, including mutations in the tumor suppressor
gene TP53, which occur frequently in many human malignancies. In this study, we present a multiple regression analysis of
transcriptomic data in 123 patients with non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) showing that TP53 mutations are associated
with higher VEGF-A expression (P ¼ 0.006). This association

was interesting given a recent retrospective study showing
longer progression-free survival in patients with diverse tumors
who receive bevacizumab, if tumors harbor mutant TP53
instead of wild-type TP53. Thus, our current ﬁndings linking
TP53 mutation with VEGF-A upregulation offered a mechanistic explanation for why patients exhibit improved outcomes
after bevacizumab treatment when their tumors harbor mutant
TP53 versus wild-type TP53. Overall, this work warrants further evaluation of TP53 as a ready biomarker to predict
bevacizumab response in NSCLC and possibly other tumor
types. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1187–90. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

bevacizumab on outcome may be due to the fact that a subset of
patients respond, while others derive no salutary effects or,
conceivably, might even be harmed by bevacizumab. Yet, no
biomarker for patient selection has been identiﬁed. This is especially important because bevacizumab can have serious toxicity,
including hypertension and bowel perforation; it is also extremely
expensive, costing about 40,000 to 100,000 dollars per year (4).
Of interest in this regard, we recently reported, in a retrospective
study of patients with diverse cancers, that use of bevacizumabcontaining regimens predicted for longer progression-free survival (PFS) in TP53-mutant tumors (multivariate analysis; P < 0.001;
PFS ¼ 11 vs. 5.0 months; mut vs. wt TP53; ref. 5). The mechanism
by which this correlation might occur remains unclear. However,
several studies suggest a role for TP53 in angiogenesis (6, 7).
Importantly in this regard, though early data failed to ﬁnd a clear
association between VEGF expression and outcome after bevacizumab administration, recent data using improved technology
suggest that circulating levels of the short isoform of VEGF-A is a
strong biomarker candidate for predicting beneﬁt (8).
Herein, we report that, in a transcriptomic evaluation of NSCLC
(2), multiple regression analysis showed that VEGF-A expression
correlated independently with TP53 mutational status. These data
link TP53 mutations directly with VEGF-A, the primary target of
bevacizumab, and suggest that TP53 status merits further exploration as a biomarker for bevacizumab response in NSCLC as well
as in additional neoplasms.

Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of
cancer-related deaths (1) and represents a heterogeneous group
of neoplasms, mostly squamous cell and adenocarcinoma. A
diagnosis of NSCLC carries a grim prognosis; 5-year survival is
less than 15% (2). Bevacizumab is an antibody that targets
vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Bevacizumab
combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel has been approved for
the initial treatment of unresectable NSCLC, based on a 2-month
increase in survival (12.3 vs. 10.3 months) when compared with
the chemotherapy alone (3). Bevacizumab is also used in the
treatment of renal and colon cancer and glioblastoma multiforme, with similar modest beneﬁts; its approval for breast cancer
was recently revoked by the FDA. The relatively small impact of

tissues were banked after written informed patient consent, and
the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institut
Gustave Roussy.
Gene expression assay and analysis
RNA was extracted with TRIzol, quantiﬁed and qualiﬁed with a
Nanodrop. Gene expression was performed with 244K Human
exon array from Agilent (custom design with the content of the
44K Human genome plus 195,000 probes, one for each exon as
deﬁned in the refGene list of UCSC build hg18; http://genome.
ucsc.edu/). The differential gene expression in tumor versus
matched normal lung tissues was calculated in each patient and
used in our analysis.
Gene mutations analysis
DNA was extracted with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen).
This was followed by PCR ampliﬁcation of target exons. Sequence
analysis and alignment were performed with SeqScape software
(Applied Biosystems). All detected mutations were conﬁrmed in
at least one independent PCR reaction. In all 123 samples, full
coding sequences of exons, including oncogenic mutational hotspots, were analyzed corresponding to TP53 (NM_000546.4)
exons 5–8; KRAS (NM_004448.2) exons 2 and 3; EGFR
(NM_005228.3) exons 18–21; PIK3CA (NM_006218.2) exons
10 and 21; BRAF (NM_004333.4) exon 15; and ERBB2
(NM_004448.2) exons 18, 20–24.
Statistical analysis
Associations between TP53 mutational status and RNA expression levels were assessed with a Mann–Whitney test in a univariable analysis. Multiple regression models were ﬁt to assess the best
predictors for VEGF-A expression and the association between
TP53 status and other variables. Assumptions of multiple regression have been checked graphically. A subanalysis was performed,
segregating by histology. P values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant. All statistical analyses were conducted
using SPSS software (v.22.0).

Results and Discussion
Our study population (N ¼ 123) was composed of 57 patients
with adenocarcinoma of the lung (46%), 50 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (41%), 13 patients with large-cell carcinoma

(11%), and three were unclassiﬁed cases (3%). Testing for aberrations in the TP53, KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, PIK3CA, and ERBB2 genes
revealed the following rates of abnormalities: TP53 (N ¼ 31, 25%;
24.6% of adenocarcinoma vs. 28.6% of squamous cell;
P ¼ 0.665; Supplementary Results); KRAS (N ¼ 20, 18%); EGFR
(N ¼ 13, 12%); PIK3CA (N ¼ 2); and BRAF and ERBB2 (N ¼ 1
each; Supplementary Table S1).
In univariable analysis, transcriptomic data (84 gene products;
Supplementary Table S2) showed differential expression as follows: median fold changes of tumor versus normal tissues of
VEGF-A (3.9 vs. 3.0; P ¼ 0.015), mTOR (1.8 vs 1.4; P ¼ 0.013),
BAX (1.8 vs 1.6; P ¼ 0.033), APAF1 (0.7 vs 0.6; P ¼ 0.028), and
AREG (0.1 vs. 0.2; P ¼ 0.015; mut vs. wt TP53). In multiple
regression analysis, TP53 mutations correlated independently
with higher VEGF-A (P ¼ 0.006) and BAX (P ¼ 0.032) expression
(Table 1).
Using VEGF-A as the dependent variable, in a multiple linear
regression analysis including TP53, KRAS, and EGFR (all mut vs.
wt), histology (adenocarcinoma vs. squamous), and the other
genes found differentially expressed (BAX, mTOR APAF1, and
AREG) as variables, the only statistically signiﬁcant independent
predictor for VEGF-A expression was TP53 mutational status
(P ¼ 0.006; Table 2). When forward and backward regression
analyses were performed, both tests conﬁrmed that TP53 mutation was the best independent predictor for higher VEGF-A levels
(P ¼ 0.008). Segregating by histology, a multiple regression
analysis demonstrated that TP53 mutational status was the only
independent factor predicting increased VEGF-A expression in
adenocarcinoma (P ¼ 0.007) but not in squamous cell carcinoma
(P ¼ 0.599), consistent with the observation that expression levels
of VEGF-A were signiﬁcantly higher in TP53-mutated specimens
in adenocarcinoma (median 5.95 vs. 3.0; P ¼ 0.012), but not in
squamous cell carcinoma (median 3.9 vs. 3.1; P ¼ 0.636; Supplementary Table S3). This difference between adenocarcinoma
and squamous cell carcinoma suggests the complexity of the
mechanisms involving TP53 and angiogenesis regulation, and
illustrates possible mechanistic differences between tissues.
Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the growth and spread of
cancer, as the resulting new blood vessels supply the tumor with
needed nutrients and oxygen; VEGF is probably the most commonly involved proangiogenic factor (9). Our data complement
previous preclinical data in NSCLC correlating either aberrant
TP53 expression with higher VEGF level (measured by

quantitative reverse transcription PCR; ref. 10), or TP53 gene
mutations with a strongly positive VEGF immunoreactivity
(11). Further, wt TP53 indirectly represses VEGF promoter activity
by inhibiting transcription factors, e.g., SP1 and E2F; there is also a
TP53-binding site adjacent to the hypoxia-inducible factor-1a
(HIF1a) binding site that resides within the VEGF promoter and is
essential for VEGF induction during hypoxia (12). In addition,
Narendran and colleagues (7) showed that transfection of stromal
cells with mutant p53 increased synthesis of VEGF. These mechanistic data are consistent with our observation of high VEGF-A
transcripts in the presence of mutant TP53. BAX transcript levels
were also higher in tumors harboring mutant TP53 (Table 1). The
BAX product, also known as Bcl-2–like protein 4, promotes
apoptosis by binding to and antagonizing the Bcl-2 protein. An
association between BAX overexpression and speciﬁc TP53 mutations of the loop–sheet–helix in NSCLC has previously been
reported, though other types of TP53 mutations correlated with
lower levels of BAX expression (13).
Using gene expression proﬁling techniques, prior studies also
demonstrated that adenocarcinoma and squamous cell NSCLCs
have different expression portfolios (2, 14), which is in line with
our observation that the association between TP53 mutations and
increased VEGF-A transcripts appears speciﬁc for adenocarcinoma
of the lung. It is conceivable that the improved outcome that was
previously reported by our group (5) in bevacizumab-treated
patients who harbored TP53 mutations versus wild-type TP53
is due to the association between TP53 mutations and higher
VEGF-A, the target for bevacizumab. However, this association
may not hold true for all tumor types. For instance, beneﬁt from
bevacizumab could not be correlated with TP53 status in metastatic colorectal cancer (15, 16). On the other hand, these prior
studies in colorectal cancer had signiﬁcant differences in methodology that might have inﬂuenced outcome. Kara and colleagues
(15) examined only 34 patients and analyzed p53 expression, not
mutational status; Ince and colleagues (16) examined survival,
not PFS. In contrast, the multivariate analysis demonstrating that
a bevacizumab-containing regimen was an independent factor
associated with better outcomes in TP53-mutated patients included a variety of tumors and analyzed PFS (5).
The salutary effects of antiangiogenic therapy can differ dramatically, depending on the cancer type. For the majority of
tumors, bevacizumab must be combined with other drugs to

show beneﬁt. Few responses are observed with monotherapy (9).
One exception is ovarian cancer, where monotherapy with bevacizumab can achieve response rates in the 16% to 21% range
even in advanced disease (17). One of the most responsive subsets
of ovarian cancer is the high-grade serous histology. Of interest in
this regard, TP53 mutations are a hallmark of these tumors, with a
frequency exceeding 90% (18). In sharp contrast, prostate carcinomas, with a rather low TP53 mutation frequency (approximately 11%; ref. 19), failed to demonstrate beneﬁt from bevacizumab (20).
Our study demonstrates an independent correlation between
TP53 mutations and VEGF-A expression in a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of 123 patients with NSCLC. One of the
distinctive features of this dataset is the investigation of differential
gene expression in tumor versus matched normal lung tissues, in
each patient. This methodology enabled us to discard the noise
from the background variability between patients and to pinpoint
expression anomalies most likely related to oncogenesis. This
unique study feature enabled the demonstration, for the ﬁrst time,
of an independent association between TP53 mutational status and
overexpression of VEGF-A. Further interrogation of the data indicates that this correlation pertains to adenocarcinomas, consistent
with bevacizumab's approval for adenocarcinomas of the lung.
Bevacizumab has previously been hailed as the best-selling
drug in oncology. However, for most cancers in which it is used,
including NSCLC, renal, and colon cancer as well as glioblastoma
multiforme, bevacizumab increases survival by only a couple of
months. Furthermore, the FDA recently acted to rescind its
approval in breast cancer because of the lack of proof a survival
advantage, despite previous evidence of some activity in this
disease (8). Most likely, in relevant malignancies, a subgroup of
patients is responsive to bevacizumab, but a biomarker deﬁning
this subset has remained elusive. TP53 mutations are found in
diverse cancers, and 25% of our NSCLC patients had a TP53
alteration. Indeed, TP53 is one of the most commonly aberrant
genes across tumors, yet there is no approved therapy that targets
it. Our data have previously suggested a clinical association
between TP53 mutations and better PFS after bevacizumab treatment (5). Our current observations show that TP53 mutations are
an independent predictor of high expression of VEGF-A, the
primary target of bevacizumab. These observations suggest that
upregulation of transcription of the VEGF-A gene (12) may link
TP53 status to antiangiogenic therapy outcome. Prospective investigation of TP53 as a biomarker for response to bevacizumab, and
possibly other antiangiogenic agents, in NSCLC, as well as other
malignancies, is therefore warranted.
