ABSTRACT
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer
characterized by the absence of defined molecular targets, including estrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2) and is associated with high rates of relapse and distant metastasis despite
surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. The lack of effective targeted therapies for
TNBC represents an unmet therapeutic challenge. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2
kinase (eEF2K) is an atypical calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase
that promotes TNBC tumorigenesis, progression, and drug resistance, representing
a potential novel molecular target. However, the mechanisms regulating eEF2K
expression are unknown. Here, we report that eEF2K protein expression is highly
up-regulated in TNBC cells and patient tumors and it is associated with poor patient
survival and clinical outcome. We found that loss/reduced expression of miR-603
leads to eEF2K overexpression in TNBC cell lines. Its expression results in inhibition
of eEF2K by directly targeting the 3-UTR and the inhibition of tumor cell growth,
migration and invasion in TNBC. In vivo therapeutic gene delivery of miR-603 into
TNBC xenograft mouse models by systemic administration of miR-603-nanoparticles
led to a significant inhibition of eEF2K expression and tumor growth, which was
associated with decreased activity of the downstream targets of eEF2K, including Src,
Akt, cyclin D1 and c-myc. Our findings suggest that miR-603 functions as a tumor
suppressor and loss of miR-603 expression leads to increase in eEF2K expression and
contributes to the growth, invasion, and progression of TNBC. Taken together, our
data suggest that miR-603-based gene therapy is a potential strategy against TNBC.

65,000 cases of in situ breast cancer are diagnosed, and
more than 40,000 women die to breast cancer [2]. BC is
a highly complex and heterogeneous disease with distinct
biological and clinical behaviors [3]. BC is classified into
five major subtypes according to molecular features and
intrinsic expression of the genes encoding the estrogen

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy
among women and the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide [1]. Every year in the United
States, nearly 232,000 cases of invasive breast cancer and

receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2): luminal A (ER
and/or PR positive and HER2 negative), luminal B (ER or
PR positive and HER2 positive), HER2 overexpressing,
normal-breast like and basal-like or triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) phenotype [3].
TNBC accounts for approximately 10-20% of all
cases of breast cancer and is characterized by the absence
of yet defined molecular targets, including estrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [4, 5]. Thus,
therapies targeting ER (i.e., tamoxifen) and HER2 (also
known as eERB2) (i.e., trastuzumab) are ineffective
against TNBC [5]. The other important characteristics
of TNBC include aggressive clinical behavior, early
relapses, and metastasis as well as reduced sensitivity to
conventional therapies. The poor clinical outcome and
short overall patient survival predominantly attributed
to intratumoral heterogeneity and mutated TP53, which
is detected in up to 84% of TNBC cases [5–7]. A better
understanding of the biology of TNBC and the underlying
molecular mechanisms are needed to identify novel
therapeutic targets and develop highly effective targeted
therapies for improved patient outcomes [8–10].
Recently, emerging evidence has revealed that
eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) is a
potential molecular driver in several cancers, including
pancreatic, brain and breast cancer [11–16]. eEF2K is
the only calcium/calmodulin activated member of the
α-kinase family and is considered an atypical kinase since
its catalytic domain is not structurally similar to those of
conventional protein kinases [17, 18]. eEF2K activity is
regulated by multiple mechanisms to control the rate of
protein chain elongation by phosphorylating/inactivating
eEF2 (at threonine 56), which mediates the movement
of the ribosome on transfer RNA (tRNA) from the A site
to the P site [19–23]. eEF2K promotes cell survival in
conditions of nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and metabolic
stress by regulating the rate of translation [24]. Recently,
eEF2K was shown to promote cell proliferation, cell
migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and TNBC tumorigenesis and progression through
modulating the cell cycle (G1/S transition) by regulating
cyclin D1, c-myc, PI3K/Akt, Src/Fak and insulin-like
growth factor receptor (IGFR) signaling [11, 13, 14,
16]. Therapeutic targeting of eEF2K triggers apoptosis
and suppresses TNBC tumor growth, in addition to
and increased doxorubicin and paclitaxel efficacy [16].
These reports suggest that eEF2K is a critical factor
for breast cancer progression and the strategies aimed
at manipulating the activity of eEF2K may aid the
development of novel treatment regimens for TNBC.
Non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNA)
have emerged as new regulators of gene expression
across various biological processes, including cell cycle
regulation, differentiation, metabolism and aging. miRNAs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are involved in many diseases such as cardiovascular
and neurodegenerative diseases and but they also play
an a vital role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and
clinical applications as therapeutics [25]. miRNAs can
be used to classify a wide variety of human cancers with
particular signatures and define the molecular architecture
of human cancers [26–30]. miRNAs are 18-25 nucleotides
in length and regulate the expression of target genes at
the posttranscriptional level through interaction with
complementary sequences usually found in the 3’-UTRs
of target mRNAs, resulting in inhibition of translation and/
or in mRNA degradation [25].
Several oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs
have been identified as the promoters of tumor formation
and growth when aberrantly expressed in various cancers
[27]. Oncogenic miRs are frequently over-expressed
in cancer tissues, including miR-21, miR-17-92, miR155 and miR-372, while miRs such as miR-34 and the
let-7 family miR-15a and miR-16-1 are considered as
tumor suppressors and their expression is often reduced
in cancer tissues [27]. Over the years of studies, growing
evidences have shown that miRNAs have an important
role in breast cancer progression, invasion, angiogenesis
and metastasis. Apparently, some miRNAs functionally
take part in several important cell proliferation pathways
such Src, and MAPK and the aberrant expression of these
miRNAs is responsible for evading growth suppressors
and sustaining proliferative signaling in breast cancer cells
[31–33]. miRNA 603 (miR-603) was recently identified
through genome-wide analysis in glioblastoma [34] and
thyroid cancer with a potential role in cell transformation
[35]. However the role of miR-603 in breast cancer has
not been characterized previously and was the focus of
the current study.
This study demonstrates for the first time that
miR-603 functions as tumor suppressor in TNBC and
its expression plays an important role in TNBC cell
proliferation, migration/invasion, and tumorigenesis
through the regulation of eEF2K. Our data also suggest
that miR-603-based gene therapy or eEF2K targeted
approaches may be a potential therapeutic strategy against
TNBC.

RESULTS
eEF2K expression is upregulated in TNBC cell
lines and patient tumors
To evaluate eEF2K expression in TNBC we
determined the protein expression level of eEF2K in
TNBC cell lines and patient tumors by Western blot and
immunohistochemistry, respectively. The expression levels
of eEF2K protein were significantly higher in MDAMB-436, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, BT-20, and
BT-549 cells than in the non-tumorigenic normal breast
cell epithelium MCF-10A cells (Figure 1A). We also

expression levels of miR-603 in TNBC cell lines and in MCF-10A cells were quantified by qPCR using specific primers. The data were
normalized to the expression of U6 small nuclear RNA and are shown as means with SDs for three independent experiments.

miR-603 expression suppresses eEF2K in TNBC
cells

investigated eEF2K expression in 9 TNBC patient and 10
normal breast tissue biopsy samples. The expression levels
of eEF2K protein were highly positive in TNBC patient
biopsy samples (66.66% 6 and 9 patient tumors) than
in normal breast tissues (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Figure 1A).

Since miR-603 is markedly downregulated in
TNBC cell lines, we ectopically overexpressed miR603 in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and BT-20 cells
and measured changes in the expression of eEF2K
mRNA and protein levels. As shown in Supplementary
Figure 2A, in miR-603 mimic-transfected MDAMB-231, MDA-MB-436, and BT-20 cells, miR-603
was expressed at levels that were 18, 5.1, and 14 times
higher, respectively, than in the corresponding cell
lines transfected with the control miRNA. Ectopic
overexpression of miR-603 significantly suppressed
the eEF2K mRNA levels in MDA-MB-231, MDAMB-436 cells and BT-20 cells (Figure 2A). We further
demonstrated by western blot that miR-603 expression
also led to reduced eEF2K protein expression in MDAMB-231 (59.8% reduction), MDA-MB-436 (47.6%
reduction) and BT-20 cells (46.8% reduction) (Figure
2B), indicating that miR-603 is a potential regulator of
eEF2K expression in TNBC cells.

eEF2K expression is associated with poor
prognosis and breast cancer patient survival
To elucidate the clinical significance of eEF2K
protein expression, we first analyzed TCGA database and
determined the prognostic value of eEF2K in 58 breast
cancer patients with basal subtype. Overall survival curves
were plotted according to eEF2K gene expression levels
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Overall survival rate was
significantly lower in patients with high eEF2K expression
than in patients with low eEF2K expression (p = 0.0398)
(Figure 1C).

miR-603 expression in TNBC is inversely
correlated with eEF2K mRNA expression

miR-603 regulates eEF2K mRNA expression by
directly binding to 3’-UTR region

We first analyzed the levels of eEF2K mRNA
in TNBC cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, MDAMB-436, BT-20, BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines
and the non-tumorigenic cell line MCF-10A via qPCR.
The results showed that eEF2K mRNA levels were
upregulated in TNBC cell lines (Figure 1D). To identify
miRNAs that target and regulate eEF2K gene expression,
we used four different algorithms that predict the mRNA
targets of miRNAs: TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.
org/cgi-bin/targetscan/vert_70), miRDB (http://mirdb.org/
cgi-bin/search.cgi), microRNA.org (http://www.microrna.
org/microrna/searchGenes.do), and Diana microT (http://
diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/) to select
miRNAs that may target eEF2K. Based on this target
prediction strategy, miR-603 was the common miRNA that
targets eEF2K in all four database (Figure 1E). We also
selected miR-3613-3p and miR-3163 that were common in
the three of the databases for binding scores for targeting
eEF2K (Figure 1E).
The basal expression levels of miR-603, miR-36133p, and miR-3163 in TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-436, and BT-20) were compared to their
expression levels in MCF-10A cells by qPCR. Only miR603 expression was lower in all three TNBC cell lines
than in MCF-10A cells (Figure 1F), suggesting an inverse
relationship of miR-603 to eEF2K and potential role for
miR-603 directly binding eEF2K mRNA and regulating its
expression. The basal expression levels of miR-3613-3p
and miR-3163 did not show any correlation with eEF2K
expression in TNBC cell lines (Supplementary Figure
1B and 1C). Therefore, we hypothesized based on target
prediction tools and the inverse correlation that eEF2K is
a direct target of miR-603 in human TNBC cells.

To determine whether the negative regulatory
effect of miR-603 on eEF2K expression is mediated
through direct binding to the predicted sites in the 3’UTR of the eEF2K mRNA according to four different
algorithms, we evaluated three different predicted miR603 binding sites were found in3’-UTR region of eEF2K
gene (Figure 2C). The resulting plasmids were transfected
into HEK293 cells along with the miR-603 mimic or the
scrambled negative-control miRNA. As shown in Figure
2D, luciferase activity was significantly reduced in cells
transfected with the plasmid containing the binding site 3
in the 3’-UTR of miR-603 (p = 0.03). To further provide
proof of the binding of miR-603 to the specific binding
motifs, we also introduced point mutations (CACTGCC>TATGACT) into the corresponding miR-603 binding site
in the 3’-UTR of eEF2K. pEZX-MT06 miRNA reporter
vector containing one point mutation was also used. Only
the mutation in binding site 3 (2037–2065 bp; Figure
2C) completely reversed the effect of overexpression of
miR-603 (Supplementary Figure 2B). We also performed
miRNA luciferase reporter assay in MDA-MB-436
and MDA-MB-231 cells resulting in luciferase activity
was significantly reduced in cells transfected with the
plasmid containing the binding site 3 in the 3’-UTR of
miR-603 (MDA-MB-436; p < 0.005 and MDA-MB-231;
p<0.05). Collectively, our findings suggest that binding
site 3 contributes to the interaction between miR-603 and
eEF2K mRNA and that miR-603 directly recognizes and
binds to the eEF2K 3’-UTR to regulate the expression of
the eEF2K mRNA transcript.

miR-603 suppresses proliferation and
clonogenicity of TNBC cells by regulating
signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation,
survival and invasion

miR-603 expression impairs TNBC cell
motility, migration and invasion by
downregulation of eEF2K
After finding miR-603 inhibits Src/Fak signaling
axis, next, we investigated whether miR-603 expression
suppresses tumor cell migration and invasion, we first
transfected MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells
with miR-603. Figure 4A shows the effects of miR603 expression on cell migration and the associated
morphological changes in the two cell lines. After 24
h, the control miRNA-transfected cells covered 65% to
85% of the space generated by physically removing cells,
whereas miR-603-overexpressing cells covered less than
40% of the space (Figure 4B), indicating that miR-603expression leads to reduced cell motility and migration.
To examine the role of miR-603 expression in
regulating the ability of TNBC cell invasion, we performed
in vitro matrigel invasion assay. The results showed that
the number of cells invading matrigel was significantly
lower in miR-603-transfected cells than in control miR
transfected cells (MDA-MB-231, 111.8 ± 2.469 vs. 187.0
± 3.967 cells, p < 0.001); MDA-MB-436, 129.2 ± 4.206
vs. 218.0 ± 3.795 cells, p < 0.001 and BT-20, 86.67 ±
2.472 vs. 192.8 ± 5.952 cells (p < 0.001) (Figure 4C).
Together, these results suggest that miR-603 expression
suppresses migration and invasion of TNBC cells.

To examine the short term effects (72h) of miR603 on proliferation of TNBC cells, we used MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells and performed
proliferation (MTS) assay. The results showed that in miRoverexpressing MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells,
absorbance at 490 nm was 27.40 and 18.34 units lower,
respectively, than in the corresponding control cells (72
h) (Figure 3A).
We further examined the effects of miR-603
on TNBC cell proliferation and clonogenicity using
a colony formation assay. The miR-603-transfected
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and BT-20 cells formed
fewer (18.00 ± 2.64, 24.00 ± 2.64 and 27.00± 1.73
colonies per well, respectively) and smaller colonies
than the corresponding control-mimic transfected cells
(44.00 ± 2.00, 53.00 ± 2.00 and 53.67 ± 1.76 colonies
per well, respectively) (Figure 3B). A significant
decrease in cell proliferation and colony formation
was observed in MDA-MB-231 (***p=0.0003), MDAMB-436 (***p=0.0002) and BT-20 (****p=0.0004)
cells transfected with miR-603. These results confirm
the growth inhibiting effects of miR-603 in TNBC cells.
The miR-603-inhibitor-transfected MDA-MB-231
cells did not generate significantly different number of
colonies (44.00 ± 1.15 colonies per well) compared to
the corresponding control cells (44.67 ± 3.48 colonies
per well). Down regulation of the expression of miR-603
with inhibitors had no effect on the growth of MDAMB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure 3A) probably
because the endogenous levels of miR-603 in these cells
are relatively low.
To elucidate the effects of miR-603 expression on
downstream targets/signaling pathways in MDA-MB-231
cells, we used RPPA to analyze MDA-MB-231 cells
transfected with miR-603 or the control miRNA (Figure
3C). RPPA results indicated that ectopic expression of
miR-603 decreased the expression of eEF2K, p-Src,
matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), and E-cadherin
but increased the expression of p21, PTEN, p53, and
p27 in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results revealed that
overexpression of miR-603 may alter pathways that are
involved in cell proliferation, survival, migration, and
invasion, the cell cycle, and/or apoptosis.
To evaluate that the activity of Akt and Src is
affected by the miR-603/eEF2K axis, MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-436 cells were transfected with miR-603
or the control miRNA. Western blot analysis showed
reduced levels of p-Akt (Ser473), cyclin D1, p-Src
(Tyr416) and p-Fak (Tyr397) following miR-603 ectopic
overexpression in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cell
lines (Figure 3D).

eEF2K inhibits cell proliferation and
migration/invasion of TNBC cells
To further elucidate the mechanism by which miR603 regulates cell proliferation, motility and invasion
through eEF2K inhibition in TNBC cells, we investigated
the effects of eEF2K knockdown on proliferation,
migration, and invasion of TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-436 cells transfected with eEF2K siRNA
had significantly lower colony formation ability (34.00
± 1.73; and 31.33 ± 1.85 colonies per well, respectively)
than control cells (63.33 ± 3.18 and 48.67 ± 1.20 colonies
per well, respectively)(**p=0.0035; **p=0.0026) (Figure
5A). These results confirm the growth inhibiting effects
of silencing of eEF2K in TNBC cells. Additionally,
knockdown of eEF2K significantly inhibited in vitro cell
invasion as indicated by reduced the number of matrigel
invading MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells (Figure
5B). The results showed that the number of cells invading
was significantly lower in eEF2K-transfected cells than
in control siRNA transfected cells (MDA-MB-231,
102.2 ± 3.95 vs. 199.5 ± 2.97 cells, *** p < 0.0001) and
MDA-MB-436, 121.7 ± 4.50 vs. 211.2 ± 6.60 cells, ***p
< 0.0001 (Figure 5B). These results indicate that the
silencing of eEF2K inhibits proliferation and invasion
of TNBC cells and recapitulates the effects of miR603,
indicating that the miR-603-induced effects are mediated
by inhibition of eEF2K.

In vivo delivery of miR-603 inhibits cell
proliferation and microvessel density and
induces apoptosis in TNBC tumors

Furthermore, knockdown of eEF2K by siRNA
markedly reduced the expression levels of p-EF2, p-Src,
p-Akt, p-Fak, and cyclin D1 but not total EF2, Src, Akt,
and Fak in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells
compared to the levels in cells treated with the control
siRNA (Figure 5C). These results showed that suppression
of Akt and Src by miR-603 is accompanied by reduced
TNBC cell proliferation and survival, indicating that
miR-603 recapitulates the effects of eEF2K knockdown
in TNBC cells.
Given the suggested contribution of eEF2K
signaling inhibition through miR-603 in TNBC cells, we
determined whether overexpression of eEF2K gene could
reverse the effect of miR-603-mediated inhibition. Thus,
we overexpressed human eEF2K gene in MDA-MB-231
cells, (see in Experimental Procedures), and the levels of
eEF2K and pEF2 expression were confirmed by Western
Blotting (Supplementary Figure 3B). We further examined
the effect of miR-603 mimic or miR-control transfections
in eEF2K overexpressed or empty vector containing
MDA-MB-231 cells. As a result, eEF2K overexpression
reversed the effects of miR-603 mimic in MDA-MB-231
cells and led to reduced inhibition in the expression of
eEF2K and its downstream targets such as p-EF2, p-Src,
and p-Fak, indicating that the effect of miR-603 on key
signaling pathways/molecules is mediated by eEF2K
downregulation (Supplementary Figure 3C).

The proliferative activity of the MDA-MB-436
tumor cells was measured by evaluating the expression of
the proliferation marker Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry.
The number of Ki-67-positive tumor cells was significantly
lower in miR-603-treated mice than in the control mice (p
< 0.001) (Figure 6D). Immunohistochemical analyses for
microvessel density showed that the number of CD31positive cells was dramatically lower in the miR-603treated group than in the control group (Figure 6D). We
also assessed the rate of apoptosis using the TUNEL assay
(Figure 6D) and found that the miR-603 treatment resulted
in a significantly higher number of TUNEL-positive cells
than did treatment with the control miRNA, indicating
induction of apoptosis (p < 0.001). Taken together, our
results revealed that miR-603 inhibited TNBC tumor growth
in association with significant inhibition of tumor cell
proliferation and angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis.

In vivo delivery of miR-603 inhibits eEF2K, Akt,
Src/Akt and c-myc in TNBC tumors
Tumor samples were further analyzed by western
blotting for the expression of eEF2K and the downstream
targets of eEF2K, including p-EF2, p-Src, p-Akt, p-Fak,
and c-myc [16]. The results showed that the expression
levels of eEF2K, p-EF2, p-Src, p-Akt, p-Fak, and c-myc
were markedly lower in the miR-603-treated group than in
the control miRNA-treated group (Figure 6E). Overall, the
data suggest that miR-603 treatment effectively suppressed
the expression of eEF2K protein in tumors.

In vivo gene therapy by systemic
administration of miR-603 reduces growth of
orthotopic TNBC xenograft tumors in mice
To determine the role of miR-603 in TNBC
tumorigenesis and progression as well as the therapeutic
potential of miR-603-based gene therapy, we assessed
the effects of miR-603 expression in a MDA-MB-436
orthotopic xenograft mouse model. MDA-MB-436 cells
were orthotopically implanted into the right mammary
fat pad of nude mice. About 2 weeks later, liposomal
nanoparticles incorporating miR-603 or the controls
(0.3 mg/kg) were intravenously (i.v) administered once
a week. No toxic effects were observed in the 4 weeks
after the administration of pegylated liposomal miR-603
nanoparticles; the mice appeared healthy and did not lose
weight during the 4-weeks of treatment (Figure 6A). The
mean weights of mice treated with miR-603 and mice
treated with the control miRNA were 26.5 ± 0.8 g and
25.9 ± 0.85 g, respectively (Figure 6A). The volumes of
xenograft tumors were measured every week for 4 weeks
(Figure 6B). Four weeks after the treatment, the xenograft
tumors were excised and analyzed for eEF2K down
modulation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis
as well as pathway regulation. The mice treated with
liposomal miR-603 had a significantly lower rate of tumor
growth and drastically smaller tumors than the control
mice (Figure 6B, 6C).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report for the first time that miR603 acts as a tumor suppressor in TNBC by directly
regulating eEF2K expression, thereby inhibiting cell
proliferation, survival, invasion, and tumorigenesis. We
also demonstrated that eEF2K is highly overexpressed in
TNBC cells and reduced or loss of miR-603 expression
contributes to upregulation of eEF2K and TNBC tumor
growth and progression.
We previously reported that EF2K signaling
is one of the critical drivers of TNBC tumorigenesis
and its inhibition suppresses tumor growth and
significantly enhances the efficacy of most commonly
used chemotherapeutics in TNBC tumor models [16].
The current study indicated that the majority of TNBC
patient tumors (66.6%) are strongly positive for eEF2K
expression by IHC. Our study also demonstrated that
reduced miR-603 expression leads to increased eEF2K
expression in TNBC cells, providing the first evidence
regarding the mechanistic-basis of eEF2K overexpression

in TNBC. Considering that eEF2K contributes to poor
patient survival and prognosis (Figure 1C) and plays a
cytoprotective role in response to treatments that induce
energy stress and cytotoxic effects through induction of
autophagy [37] and promotes cell proliferation, cell cycle
progression, drug resistance and invasion, reduced or
loss of miR-603 seems to be a critical factor leading to
induction of eEF2K. Furthermore, our analysis of TCGA
databases also indicated that miR-603 tumor suppressor
is undetectable in majority of breast cancer samples,
preventing us to perform Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
with regard to overall survival analysis, suggesting that
miR-603 is frequently dysregulated in breast tumors.
Recently, reduced miR-603 has been implicated
in malignant transformation of thyroid cancer cells in
response to high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) expression
[35]. Interestingly, HMGA1 has been proposed to be
a master regulator of tumor progression in TNBC by
providing oncogenic signaling and metastatic phenotype,
EMT and reprogramming TNBC cells into cancer-stem
cell like state as well as poor prognosis in breast cancer
patients [38, 39]. Thus, future studies are needed to

determine if the HMGA1 plays a role in miR603/eEF2K
axis and HMGA1 expression leads to downregulation of
miR603 and upregulation of eEF2K expression.
eEF2K is involved in inducing effects on multiple
signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt, c-myc, and
Src/Fak to promote a number of processes associated with
migration/invasion (Figure 5). The results of the current
study indicate that in vitro and in vivo overexpression of
miR-603 recapitulates the effects of eEF2K suppression
in TNBC, including inhibition of tumor cell proliferation,
migration, invasion and tumor growth. Not surprisingly,
the induction of miR-603 expression in TNBC tumors
in mice led to inhibition of PI3K/Akt and Src, further
indicating that regulation of these pathways by miR603 is mediated by inhibition of eEF2K. Furthermore,
therapeutic targeting of miR-603 by mimic or eEF2K
by siRNA-based therapeutics inhibits tumor growth
in an orthotopic xenograft model of breast cancer [16],
suggesting that strategies targeting miR-603/eEF2K axis
may provide broad antitumor effects through inhibition of
multiple oncogenic pathways (Figure 7).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

eEF2K expression is associated with resistance
to frontline chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin
and paclitaxel, and eEF2K knockdown in an in vivo
orthotopic model of breast cancer suppresses the growth
of established breast cancer tumors and sensitizes the
tumors to these chemotherapeutics [16], indicating the role
of eEF2K expression in patient survival and prognosis.
Thus, future studies combining miR-603-based therapy
with chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel or doxorubicin
expected to provide significant enhancement in the
antitumor efficacy in TNBC models and elucidate the
underlying mechanisms regarding why TNBC patients
with higher eEF2K expression have poor clinical outcome
and shorter survival.
Given that reinstatement of miR-603 expression
in TNBC is associated with inhibition of tumor growth
and down regulation of eEF2K, strategies targeting
eEF2K directly (i.e., siRNA or inhibitors) or indirectly
by targeting its regulators such as miR-603 may be a
potential therapeutic approach against TNBC. Recently
we identified FOXM1 as the first transcription factor
that regulates eEF2K expression in TNBC and its
inhibition not only reduces eEF2K expression in TNBC
also significantly suppresses TNBC tumorigenesis [13],
indicating that understanding mechanism of eEF2K
regulation and identification of upstream regulators
could also provide foundation for development of novel
therapeutic strategies for TNBC, which has poor clinical
outcome and patient survival rates due to lack of effective
molecularly targeted therapies.
Since many biological disorders result from
aberrant gene expression or gene mutations, miRNA
replacement therapy represents a promising therapeutic
approach by targeting genes that are involved in
many pathological processes [40]. In fact, miRNAs
are being evaluated in clinical trials in the United
States as a therapeutic modality against cancer [41].
Because of the potential of miRNA-based therapies,
involving reconstitution of tumor suppressor miRNAs
or suppression of oncogenic miRNAs [42], to affect
multiple targets or pathways, miRNAs have rapidly
garnered attention as a novel class of therapeutics that
can be used to modulate gene expression or regulate
undruggable targets. Increasing evidence from recent
studies supports the therapeutic potential of ncRNA
such as siRNA and miRNAs against cancer if delivered
properly into tumors [41, 43].
In conclusion, our in vitro and in vivo results
indicate that miR-603 acts as a tumor suppressor
molecule that can attenuate the proliferation and
invasion of TNBC by directly targeting eEF2K
expression. Restoration of miR-603 expression appears
to suppress various hallmarks of cancer and may be a
potential therapeutic approach against TNBC. Therefore
miR-603-based therapy is a promising strategy in the
treatment of TNBC.

Cell lines and cell culture conditions
The human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A
and TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468, BT-549, BT-20 and Human Embryonic
Kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDAMB-436, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-549, BT-20
and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 supplemented with 10%
FBS and a 100-U/ml penicillin-streptomycin solution
(Sigma). MCF-10A cells were maintained in a nutrient
mixture consisting of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5%
horse serum, epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone,
insulin and cholera toxin. All cultured cells were
incubated at 37°C in a water-saturated 95% air–5% CO2
atmosphere.

Expression of eEF2K protein in human breast
cancer patient samples and Kaplan-Meier
survival analyses
We downloaded RNASeqv2 Level3 data publicly
available from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA;
https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/) for eEF2K in patients with breast
adenocarcinoma (BRCA). Overall survival information for
58 Breast cancer patients was retrieved from cbioPortal
(http://www.cbioportal.org/)[36]. We performed Cox
regression analysis for associations between survival and
eEF2K expression levels. The analysis yielded a hazard
ratio of 2 (CI (95%)=(1. 21, 3.17), Wald test p-value
=0.0398). For cases with high eEF2K (last tertile, 66-100th
Percentile of Range) compared to cases with low eEF2K
(first tertile, 0 - 33th Percentile of Range). The KaplanMeier plots were generated for this dichotomization. The
numbers of patients at risk in low and high eEF2K groups
at different time points are presented at the bottom of the
graph.

Cell viability and colony formation assays
The proliferation of MDA-MB-436, MDAMB-231, and BT-20 cells was analyzed using
MTS
assay
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium]
as previously described [11, 16]. Briefly, 1 × 103 to 2 ×
103cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. After overnight
incubation, the cells were treated with a synthetic RNA
oligonucleotide that mimics miR-603 or with a scrambled
negative control miRNA (Ambion). Cell viability was
determined at 24, 48, and 72 h using 5 mg/ml MTS. Plates
were analyzed at 490-nm wavelength in a VMax kinetic
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplate reader
(Molecular Devices). To determine the effect of miR-603
on colony formation, we used a clonogenic assay. Briefly,

single-cell suspensions were generated for each cell line,
and 250 cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates.
After 24-h incubation, the cells were transfected with either
the control miRNA or miR-603 mimic and either eEF2K
siRNA or a control siRNA (Sigma) and cultured for 1014 days. Colonies were stained with crystal violet, and
those consisting of at least 50 cells were counted. Each
experiment was performed independently in triplicate.

min, 70°C for 5 min, 42°C for 20 min, and 85°C for 5
min. miR-603 expression was measured with the PerfeCTa
microRNA Assay Kit (Quanta BioSciences) using miRNA
primers from Quanta BioSciences using Real-time PCR
(qPCR). The miR-603 expression level was normalized
to the level of U6 small nuclear RNA (RNU6; Quanta
BioSciences), which was used as an endogenous control.
For eEF2K gene expression, reverse transcription
(RT) was performed with a RevertAid First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) at 42°C for 60 min
and 70°C for 5 min. cDNA samples were stored at -80°C
until analysis. eEF2K gene expression was measured with
theiQ SYBR Green Supermix qPCR Kit (Bio-Rad). The
sequences of the sense and anti-sense eEF2K primers
were 5’-GGA GAG AGT CGA AGG TCA CG-3’ and 5’GCA ATC AGC CAA GAC CAT CT-3’, respectively. The
sequences of the sense and anti-sense GAPDH primers
were 5’-CAA GGT CAT CCA TGA CAA CTT TG3’ and 5’-GTC CAC CAC CCT GTT GCT GTA G-3’,
respectively. cDNA synthesis was verified by detection
of the GAPDH transcript, which was used as an internal
control. Relative differences in expression were determined
using the comparative threshold cycle (2-ΔΔCt) method.

Transfections with miRNA mimics and siRNAs
MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231, and BT-20 cells
were plated in six-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105
cells/well and transiently transfected with 100 nM mature
mimics of miR-603, miR-3613-3p, and miR-3163 or
100 nM control miRNA (all from Ambion) by using
HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) in Opti-MEM
Reduced Serum Medium (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were transfected with
50 nM eEF2K siRNA or control siRNA according to the
manufacturer’s recommended protocol (Qiagen). After
6 h of transfection, cells were kept in a culture medium
containing 10% FBS for up to 72 h.

overexpressed eEF2K cell line

Protein extraction and western blotting
Seventy-two hours after miRNA transfection,
cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000
× g for 20 min at 4°C, and supernatants were collected. The
total protein concentration for each sample was determined
using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific).
Forty micrograms of total protein from each sample was
subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 4% to 15% gradient for
protein separation and electro-transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes. The expression levels of selected
proteins were detected by using specific antibodies
for eEF2K, p-EF2 (Thr56), Src, p-Src ( Tyr416),(Cell
Signaling Technology), FAK, p-FAK (Try397) (Thermo),
p-AKT (Ser473), AKT, cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz) and
β-actin (Sigma) and the corresponding HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies [16]. Immunoblots were visualized
using HyGLO Chemiluminescent HRP Antibody Detection
Reagent (Denville Scientific) in a FluorChem 8900 imager
and quantified with a densitometer using AlphaImager
software (Alpha Innotech). All experiments were
independently repeated three times.

MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with the
lentiviral plasmids containing the specified lentiviral
vector for eEF2K (NM_013302.3) with CMV promoter
(LPP-U0633-Lv105) or the mock vector (LPP-NEGLv103) according to manufacturer’s recommended
protocol. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded
into 96-well plate (1 × 103 cells/well) and incubated
overnight. Next day, lentiviral particles were diluted in
medium containing 5% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin,
supplemented by polybrene (EMD Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA, USA) at final concentration of 8 μg/ml
and added into the wells. After 48 h incubation, media
were replaced with the puromycin containing media (10
μg/ml) for selection during 3 weeks. (Invitrogen/Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). eEF2K gene expression was
determined and verified by Western blotting.

RNA extraction and miRNA and mRNA reverse
transcription and qPCR analyses
Total RNA including miRNAs was extracted
using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The
concentration and purity of the RNA were measured
by UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm using an Epoch
microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments). One
microgram of RNA was used as a template. Isolated RNA
samples were converted to complementary DNA (cDNA)
using the qScript microRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta
BioSciences) under the following conditions: 37°C for 60

Triton X-100, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, and protease
and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)
was added to the plate on ice. Cells were scraped and
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants
were collected, and total proteins were quantified using
the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. The concentration of
proteins was adjusted to 1.0 μg/μl. A 4× SDS sample
buffer (40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.25 M Tris-HCl, 10%
2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) was then added to cell lysates.
Protein samples were denatured and stored at –80°C until
RPPA processing.

103 HEK293 cells were plated in each well of a 96-well
plate. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with the pEZXMT06 vector (1 μg) together with 50 nM miR-603 mimic
or control miRNA. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h
after transfection by the Luc-Pair miR Luciferase Assay
(GeneCopoeia). For each sample, firefly luciferase activity
was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.

Preparation of miRNA nanoparticles
For in vivo delivery, miRNA was incorporated into
pegylated liposomes composed of dimyristoyl-sn-glycero3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and pegylated distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE-PEG-2000) (Avanti
Lipids). DMPC and DSPE-PEG2000 were mixed at a
10:1 ratio, and miRNA (control or miR-603 mimic, 8ug
miR/mouse) was mixed at a 10:1 (w/w) ratio of lipids to
oligonucleotides in the presence of excess tertiary butanol.
Prior to in vivo administration, lyophilized lipid/miRNA
complex was reconstituted in 0.9% saline. The liposomal
suspension filtered and centrifuged. The liposomes trapped
in the filter was reconstituted and used for injections.

Cell motility, migration and invasion assays
An in vitro wound healing assay was used to
measure cell motility and migration. MDA-MB-436, MDA
MB-231, and BT-20 cells were plated in six-well plates
(2 × 105 cells/well) and cultured in medium containing
10% FBS. After 24-h incubation, the cells were transfected
with the control miRNA or the miR-603 mimic. A
straight scratch was made on the cell layer using a 200-μl
sterile pipette tip (time 0) and the medium was replaced
with fresh medium. After the treatments, the cells were
photographed using a phase contrast microscope (Nikon
Eclipse TE-200-U) to determine the wound width at 0 h.
The cultures were continued, and images were captured
at 0 and 36h instead of 12, 24, and 48h. Wound healing
was measured as the distance migrated by the leading edge
of the wound at each time point. The experiments were
performed in triplicate.
The invasion assay was performed using transwell
inserts coated with matrigel matrix (both from Corning).
After 72-h transfection with miR-603, control miRNA,
eEF2K siRNA, or control siRNA, 4 × 104 cells in serumfree medium were added to the upper chamber, allowing
invasion of the lower chamber containing medium with
10% FBS for 24 h in an incubator. At the end of the
invasion assay, invading cells were fixed and stained with
Hema 3 (Thermo Scientific), and the cells in the upper
chamber were removed by wiping with a cotton swab.
Invading cells were counted using a light microscope. All
experiments were performed in triplicate, and cells were
counted in at least five different fields in each experiment.

Orthotopic xenograft tumor model
Athymic female nude mice (4-5 weeks old) were
obtained from the Department of Experimental Radiation
Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center. All studies were
conducted according to an experimental protocol approved
by the MD Anderson Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. TNBC cells (MDA-MB-436) (2 × 106 in 20%
matrigel) were injected into the mammary fat pad of each
mouse. Two weeks after injection, when the tumor size
reached about 3-5 mm, liposomal-miRNA treatment was
initiated. Each mouse received miR-603 or control miRNA
(0.3 -mg/kg equivalent of 8 μg/mouse once a week) in a
volume of 100 μl for 4 weeks (total of four i.v. injections)
through the tail vein. Tumor volumes were measured
every week using an electronic caliper. After completion
of treatment, mice were euthanized with CO2 and weighed
to measure tumor growth. Tumor tissues were removed
and analyzed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and
TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling) analysis.

A TUNEL assay (Promega) was used to detect
and quantitate apoptotic cells in tumor tissues by
measuring nuclear DNA fragmentation according to
the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Briefly,
MDA-MB-436 tumor sections from control and miR603-treated mice were incubated with biotin-dUTP and
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase for 1 h; fluoresceinconjugated avidin was then added, and the tissue sections
were incubated for 30 min in the dark. The slides were
then stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (Thermo Scientific)
to counterstain DNA. Positively stained fluoresceinlabeled and Hoechst 33342-counterstained cells were
examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope.
The apoptosis rate in tumor tissues was obtained by
determining the average number of TUNEL-positive cells
in five fields in each section.
