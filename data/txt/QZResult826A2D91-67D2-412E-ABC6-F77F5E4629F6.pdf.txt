ABSTRACT
Malignant melanoma is the deadliest form of all skin cancers. Itraconazole, a
commonly used systemic antifungal drug, has been tested for its anti-tumor effects
on basal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Whether
itraconazole has any specific anti-tumor effect on melanoma remains unknown.
However, the goal of this study is to investigate the effect of itraconazole on melanoma
and to reveal some details of its underlying mechanism. In the in vivo xenograft
mouse model, we find that itraconazole can inhibit melanoma growth and extend the
survival of melanoma xenograft mice, compared to non-itraconazole-treated mice. Also,
itraconazole can significantly inhibit cell proliferation, as demonstrated by Ki-67 staining
in itraconazole-treated tumor tissues. In in vitro, we show that itraconazole inhibits
the proliferation and colony formation of both SK-MEL-28 and A375 human melanoma
cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that itraconazole significantly down-regulates Gli-1,
Gli-2, Wnt3A, β-catenin and cyclin D1, while it up-regulates Gli-3 and Axin-1, indicating
potent inhibitory effects of itraconazole on Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways.
Furthermore, itraconazole significantly suppresses the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway
– indicated by the down-regulated phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1 and AKT – but
has no effect on the phosphorylation of MEK or ERK. Our data suggest that itraconazole
inhibits melanoma growth through an interacting regulatory network that includes Hh,
Wnt, and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways. These results suggest that this agent has
several potent anti-melanoma features and may be useful in the synergesis of other
anti-cancer drugs via blockage of the Hh, Wnt and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways.

50-70% and 15%-30% of melanoma patients, respectively
[3]. Some genetic alterations on signaling molecules
such as CDKN2A, PDK1, PTEN, and AKT have also
been associated with the pathogenesis of melanoma
[4]. It is well known that the inappropriate reactivation
of key developmental signaling pathways in cancer is a
common signature, of which Hh and Wnt pathways are
prime examples [5]. Other recent studies have confirmed
that Hh and Wnt signal transduction pathways are
relevant to the formation and progression of melanoma
[6, 7]. Consequently, efforts to focus on development of

INTRODUCTION
Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive
cancers, accounting for roughly 4% of human skin
cancers but producing approximately 80% of deaths due
to cutaneous neoplasms [1]. The outcome of patients with
metastatic melanoma remains very poor, with a 5-year
survival rate of only 5%–15%, a rate which has not seen
any significant improvement despite intensive therapeutic
efforts over many decades [2].
Activated mutations in the oncogenes B-RAF (the
RAS-regulated kinase) and N-RAS have been detected in

inhibitors targeting these pathways are critically important
for cancer treatment, and in particular melanoma.
Itraconazole, an FDA-approved agent belonging to the
family of antifungal drugs known as azoles, has been used
clinically as such for more than 30 years. In recent years,
based on antiangiogenic and antitumor activities that were
inferred from several in vitro and in vivo models [8–10],
this compound has been repurposed in a number of phase
2 clinical trials for cancer treatment. To date, investigations
of the effectiveness of itraconazole on basal cell carcinoma,
prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer have shown
that itraconazole can increase the progression-free survival
of these cancer patients [11–13]. In addition, retrospective
studies in patients with recurrent triple-negative breast
cancer and ovarian cancer showed significant increases of
overall survival rate when itraconazole was involved [14,
15]. These results suggest that itraconazole has a great
potential for becoming a new anti-tumor drug.
Despite these promising clinical results, the
molecular mechanism by which itraconazole inhibits
tumors remains largely unknown. One possibility is that
itraconazole can inhibit angiogenesis and endothelial cell
proliferation by targeting VDAC1 to modulate the AMPK/
mTOR signaling axis in endothelial cells [16]. However,
angiogenesis is already known not to be a dominant
factor for the progression of melanoma [17]. Recently,
itraconazole has also been proposed as an antagonist of
hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway that targets protein
Smoothened (SMO), which regresses basal cell carcinoma
(BCC) and medulloblastoma. The SMO receptor, which
is composed of an extracellular cysteine-rich domain
(CRD) and an ECD linker domain, shows a high sequence
similarity to the frizzled (FZD) receptors. The latter
contain an extracellular domain (ECD) as well, which
mediates the Wnt signaling pathway [18, 19]. Indeed,
SMO and FZD receptors have been classifies in the same
class [20, 21]. As the structures between SMO and FZD
are similar, a possibility arises that itraconazole may target
both Hh and Wnt signaling pathways in melanoma.
To better understand the molecular mechanisms
of itraconazole on tumors, the effects of itraconazole
on melanoma tumor growth in mouse and in vitro
cell proliferation are assessed and the influences of
itraconazole on cell developmental signaling pathways are
investigated. We find that itraconazole effectively inhibits
melanoma by suppressing Hh, Wnt and PI3K-mTOR
signaling pathways.

viability. First, tumor cells were incubated with different
concentrations of itraconazole ranging from 0.13 to 64 μM,
and CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell viability at the
indicated time points (24-, 48- and 72-hr post treatment as
shown in Figure 1A). Itraconazole-untreated cells at each
time point were used as controls. We find that itraconazole
can effectively suppress the proliferation of A375 and
SK-MEL-28 cells in both a time- and a dose-dependent
manner, with approximate IC50 (95% CI) values of 159.2
μM (24h, 58.23–435.2 μM), 15.71 μM (48h, 10.06–24.54
nM), and 2.28 μM (72h, 1.56–3.34μM) in A375 cells and
95.0 μM (24h, 53.82–167 μM), 0.62 μM (48h, 0.29281.329 μM) and 0.29 μM (72h, 0.1332-0.6455 μM) in
SK-MEL-28 cells, respectively (Figure 1A). The overall
inhibitory effects of itraconazole seem more evident in SKMEL-28 cells than in A375 cells with an inhibitory plateau
reached at 48 hr.
Second, the proliferation of tumor cells was
observed under microscopy by a cell counting assay. In
the absence of itraconazole, A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells
rapidly proliferate and begin to form cell clusters at 48
hr. However, both types of tumor cells display reduced
proliferation after treatment with 1, 2 or 4 μM itraconazole
for 7-10 days. As shown in Figure 1B, for tested cell
densities ranging from 103 to 105/ml, the growth inhibition
increases with itraconazole dose, suggesting that the
inhibition of tumor proliferation is dose-dependent.
The ability of tumor cells to spread is then estimated
independently by counting the tumor colonies on soft
agar. In Figure 1C, untreated cells form sizeable colonies
and show rapid proliferation, but in the presence of 1, 2
or 4 μM itraconazole the colonies formed by A375 and
SK-MEL-28 cells are fewer and smaller. For example, at
doses of 2 μM and 4 μM, the number of colonies with a
respective diameters of ≥ 25μm and ≥50 μm decreases by
more than 50% as shown in Figure 1C. Again, our results
indicate a significant inhibitory effect of itraconazole on
melanoma cell proliferation.

Itraconazole modulates gene expression of
Hedgehog and Wnt pathways in melanoma cells
After A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells were treated with
2 μM itraconazole for 48 h, total RNA isolated from these
cells was used to screen RT Profiler array consisting of
84 potential genes by quantitative PCR analysis in order
to understand the molecular mechanisms of itraconazole
on melanoma proliferation. The online analysis of gene
expression is presented as scatter plots in Figure 2A. We
find that itraconazole increases Gli-3, Axin-1 expression
but decreases Gli-1, Gli-2, Axin-1, β-catenin, Wnt3A and
Cyclin D1 expression in both melanoma cell lines when
compared with untreated cells.
The RT Profiler array was then validated by
RT-PCR. Similar results are found in itraconazole
treated A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells. In the presence of

Axin-1 increased while Gli-1, Gli-2, β-catenin and Wnt3A
transcriptionally decreased in A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells

calculated and shown in Supplementary Figure 1.

itraconazole treatment causes significant reductions of Gli-1
and Gli-2 and increase of Gli-3 protein in both A375 and
SK-MEL-28 cells as shown in Figure 3A. The latter is a
transcription repressor that regulates gene transcription of
Hedgehog signaling pathway, the increase of Gli-3 therefore
indicates that itraconazole is able to suppress Hedgehog
pathway. However, the dose-dependent effect of itraconazole
on this repressor is not clear, especially between 2 and 4 μM
concentration of itraconazole used. Again, the inhibitory

effects of itraconazole on SK-MEL-28 cells are more
significant than those on A375.
To assess the functional relevance of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling in the context of itraconazole inhibitory cellgrowth, we analyzed the effects of itraconazole on the
Wnt protein and its repressor Axin-1. We find that Wnt3A
(Wnt growth factor protein) declines dramatically in SKMEL-28 cells when treated with 1 and 2 μM itraconazole
and is barely detectable when the dose is raised to 4

μM. Meanwhile, β-catenin is also down-regulated that
coincides with an increase of one endogenous WNT
inhibitor (Axin-1) in itraconazole-treated cells (Figure
3B). In consistence of a less effectiveness of itraconazole
on A375 cell growth inhibition (Figure 1A), Wnt/β-catenin
signaling responses are also subtle in A375 cells no matter
what dose of itraconazole has been or not used as shown in
Figure 3B. However, further study shows that such Wnt/βcatenin signaling responses are easily seen in SK-MEL-2
and Malme-3M cells as well (Figure 4).

(Supplementary Figure 2), indicating a high specificity of
itraconazole on the mTOR pathway. Also, we tested the
phosphorylation state of Akt that is presumably activated
by mTORC2 [24, 25]. Unlike p70S6K, the phosphorylation
of Akt at Ser473 is only slightly reduced after itraconazole
treatment (Figure 5). These results suggest that itraconazole
may inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, and inhibition of
mTORC2 probably occurs only as a direct consequence of
mTORC1 inhibition.

Itraconazole inhibits melanoma growth and
extends survival of xenograft mice in vivo

Itraconazole inhibits cyclin D1 and mTOR
pathway in melanoma cells

For in vivo efficacy of itraconazole on melanoma,
athymic nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with
A375 melanoma cells and divided into five groups. Each
group comprising 7, 7, 6, 6 or 6 mice was administered
with vehicle or itraconazole by oral gavage. The first
group (vehicle) received 40% (w/v) 2-hydroxypropylb-cyclodextrin (HPCD) solution, whereas the other four
groups received itraconazole at respective doses of 100,
75, 50, and 30 mg/kg twice a day per animal. The mice
tested in this experiment showed only a slight intolerance
to the twice daily regimen with respect to weight loss.
(Toxicity was defined as ≥20% of mice showing ≥20%
body weight loss and/or mortality) (Supplementary
Figures 3). At the beginning of itraconazole treatment,
small tumors appeared at 7 days after tumor implantation
in all the mice in the sizes of ~100 mm3.
The tumor growth in mice treated with itraconazole
are generally suppressed with our tested dosage range

The effect of itraconazole treatment on the
expression of cyclin D1 was determined in A375 and SKMEL-28 melanoma cell lines at 48 hours. In A375 and
SK-MEL-28 cells, cyclin D1 is decreased by itraconazole
treatment, indicating a cell cycle arrest. The dosedependent behavior is also clearly reflected in SK-MEL-28
cells, which appear under all circumstances to be the cell
line that is more sensitive to itraconazole (Figure 3C).
Then, a reduced expression of cyclin D1 are also verified
in SK-MEL-2 and Malme-3M cells (Figure 4).
To further explain the cell cycle arrest, we also
investigate the effect of itraconazole on the mTOR pathway
in these melanoma cells by Western blot assay. We find
that itraconazole, like rapamycin, is able to suppress the
phosphorylation of p70S6K (S6K1) and 4E-BP1 in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5). In contrast, itraconazole has
no effect on the phosphorylation of either MEK or ERK

as shown in Figures 6A & 6B, particularly in animals
receiving high doses. The inhibitory effect is dosedependent within the 20 day regimen. Compared to the
average tumor volume at day 27 of 3995.0 mm3 in mice
receiving vehicle only, the average tumor volume for
mice receiving 30 mg/kg itraconazole is 2266.2 mm3,
which is decreased by 43.27% (P=0.0325). The tumor
volumes are further suppressed with higher dosages of
itraconazole, giving the average sizes to 2040.1 mm3,
1434.6 mm3 and 955.8 mm3 for 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg
treatments, respectively. The tumor growth is reduced
by 48.9% for 50 mg/kg (P=0.0214), 64.1% for 75 mg/
kg (P=0.0147) and 76.07% for 100 mg/kg itraconazole
(P=0.0036) at day 27. At the same time, the tumor weights
in itraconazole treated mice are consistently decreased in a
dose-dependent manner in vivo as seen in Figure 6C.
The possible clinical outcomes of anti-melanoma
effects of itraconazole were also estimated by survival

measurement in this xenograft model. We find that the
median survival times of mice receiving itraconazole
(Figure 6D) are longer than the control group (21
days) as 26 days (30 mg/kg, p = 0.006), 26 days (50
mg/kg, p = 0.0364), 26.5 days (75 mg/kg, p =0.0069),
26.5 days (100 mg/kg, p =0.0313) (Figure 6D). Since
the improvement of survival time is quite limited with
the dose increasing, we recommend using a lower and
effective dose of itraconazole to minimize toxicity
(Supplementary Figure 3, 4).
Melanoma inhibition in vivo is further assessed
by measurement of Ki-67 levels in the tumor masses.
The Ki-67 protein (also known as MKI67) is a cellular
marker for cell proliferation and has been widely used in
immunohistochemical assays. By counting the positive
cells from five HPF (400×) fields per section of total six
sections per mouse (Figure 7B), our results show that
itraconazole treatment is able to inhibit Ki-67 in a dose-

Figure 5: Effect of itraconazole on mTOR pathway in melanoma cells. A375 and SK-MEL-28 Cells were treated with the

indicated concentration of itraconazole for 48 h before lysis. Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies specific for phosphoAKT (p(S473)AKT), total AKT; phospho-S6K((T389)pS6K), and total S6K; phospho-4E-BP1((T37/46)P-4E-BP1), and total 4E-BP1. The effect
of itraconazole on AKT, S6K, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in A375 and SK-MEL-28cells was quantitated. Total AKT, S6K, and 4E-BP1
values served to normalize p-AKT, p-S6K, and p4E-BP1 values to correct for differences in protein loading. After the initial subtraction
of the background signal, the ratios of pAKT to total AKT, of pS6K to total S6K and of p4E-BP1 to 4E-BP1 were determined. The value
for the control sample (DMSO) was set to 100% (or 0% inhibition), and the values for the itraconazole-treated samples were expressed as
inhibition relative to the control sample. Data were obtained from three independent experiments performed in duplicate and are expressed
as mean ± SD (*P < 0.05 vs control).

dependent manner (Figure 7B). These results strongly
suggest that itraconazole treatment can suppress tumor
cell proliferation and inhibit tumor spread in vivo as well.
Histologically, the resulting masses in this xenograft
model exhibit certain extents of necrosis in tumors excised
from mice that had been treated with itraconazole (Figure
7A). However, no statistical significance can be found
between itraconazole-treated and medium-treated mice
under microscopy.

itraconazole free- and itraconazole treated-mice were
subjected to a panel of organ functional tests including
hepatic alanine aminotransferase [ALT], total bilirubin
[TBIL], and alkaline phosphatase [ALKP] and kidney
functional tests such as contents of creatinine, urea
nitrogen [BUN], albumin, cholesterol, glucose, and
calcium in the blood samples.
The mice under high doses of itraconazole (75
mg/kg or 100mg/kg) experienced some liver function
impairments, as average levels of ALT and ALKP were
slightly higher in these mice compared to mice with lower
or no doses of itraconazole even though no statistical
significance (Supplementary Figure 4A & 4B) is evident.
On the other hand, albumin and TBIL are similar among
the groups (Supplementary Figure 4C & 4D). For kidney
function, creatinine and BUN are well maintained within

DISCUSSION

normal ranges (Supplementary Figure 4E & 4F). However,
cholesterol levels are significantly increased in mice
administered with 75 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg itraconazole,
as shown in Supplementary Figure 4G, indicating that
itraconazole interferes with cholesterol metabolism at
these higher doses. Again, both anti-melanoma effects and
side effects should be taken into account for proper dose
calibration in future practice.

Malignant melanoma is the deadliest form of skin
cancer. The incidence of the disease continues to rise faster
and mortality rates for melanoma remain generally higher
than any other cancer type, with a 5-year survival rate of
only 15% for the patients at advanced phases. The longterm prognosis is extremely poor for this disease [26].
Although much progress has been made in cancer
therapies including melanoma, challenges for melanoma
treatment still remain due to resistance and the low

specificity of drugs used currently and the lack of new drug
candidates. As soon as itraconazole had been identified as
a novel inhibitor of Hh and angiogenesis [9, 10], a number
of phase 2 clinical trials and retrospective analyses were
initiated to investigate its anti-cancer effectiveness. The
aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of using
itraconazole as an anti- melanoma agent for therapeutic
purposes.
The link between Hedgehog (Hh) signaling
pathway and human cancers has long been recognized
[27]. For example, the critical roles of Hh signaling in
the development of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) have
been convincingly demonstrated in genetic mutation
analyses, mouse models, and clinical trials of BCCs using
Hh signaling inhibitors [28]. However, the activity of the
Hh pathway in melanoma tumor genesis was not revealed
until recent years [29] due to the lack of genetic alterations
in Hh pathway genes [30] and the lack of mouse models
for Hh signaling-mediated melanoma [31]. Likely, the Hh
signaling pathway contributes to melanoma progression,
as suggested by the delayed tumor growth of B16F0
melanoma cells in immunodeficient mice and also by
tumor size reduction in a melanoma transgenic mouse
model with elevated Gli-1 that was induced by oncogenic
N-RAS when treated with Hh inhibitor [6]. In consistent
with the results from mouse model, the Gli-1 expression
also correlates with tumor progression and metastasis in
human melanomas [32].
Other downstream counterparts of Hh signaling
pathway such as Gli-2 and Gli-3 have been associated
with melanoma as well. The high expression of Gli-2 was
accompanied by invasive and metastatic phenotypes in both
in vitro and in vivo studies [33]. Gli-3 is a gene transcription
repressor and its up-regulation can effectively inhibit the
Hh-mediated progression of tumors [34]. Previous studies
on the mechanism of itraconazole on BCC revealed a
reduction of Gli-1 in itraconazole treated-BCC cells [10].
In this study with melanoma models, our data clearly show
that down-regulated Gli-1 and Gli-2, and up-regulated Gli-3
in melanoma cells and mice treated with itraconazole are
consistent with the reduced proliferation of melanoma cells
and the smaller size of tumors in mice model, suggesting that
itraconazole can serve as a potent inhibitor of Hh signaling
to aid in melanoma therapy when combined with other
drugs. Hh intracellular signaling pathway binds to SMO
and leads to inhibition of an aberrant activation of the Hh
pathway. Itraconazole acts as an inhibitor of Hh pathway that
binds to SMO. Since SMO has similar structure with FZD,
an upstream modulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
which raises a question whether the FZD-Wnt pathway is
also involved in the anti-melanoma effects of itraconazole
[35]. In the present study we find that itraconazole can
decrease Wnt3A and β-catenin by changing transcription
and protein levels in A375, SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-2 and
Malme-3M melanoma cells. In other tumor types such
as colorectal and breast cancer, activation of the Wnt/βwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

catenin pathway is often accompanied by increased tumor
genesis, tumor cell proliferation and decreased patient
survival [36–38], and activation of this pathway can be
interrupted by chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [39–41].
While the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was down-regulated
by small interfering RNAs (siRNA), apoptosis can be
induced in a variety of human cancer cells, indicating that
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway may be associated with the
apoptotic process. This correlation was also observed in the
pathogenesis of malignant melanoma [42, 43]. In about onethird of melanoma, aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway leads to a very poor prognosis [44]. Melanoma
metastasis is often associated with activation of the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway [45]. Despite these promising
characteristics, indications are sometimes contradictory
concerning the role of the Wnt /β-catenin pathway in
melanoma development. For example, one study has shown
that activation of the Wnt pathway in melanoma may be
of therapeutic benefit [38]. In addition, Axin-1, a negative
regulator of β-catenin, was also linked to tumor progression,
including melanoma [46]. We find that the expression of
Axin-1 is up-regulated in this study. Consistent with the
suppression of β-catenin and Wnt3A, we conclude that
anti-proliferative effects of itraconazole on tumor cells
are facilitated by modulating Wnt3A and β-catenin, and
negatively regulate gene Axin-1.
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR
signaling pathway plays an important role not only in the
regulation of some crucial physiological cell processes –
including cell-cycle progression, differentiation, ribosomal
biogenesis and protein translation – but also in the
regulation of certain aspects of tumor behavior such as
cell growth, survival and chemoresistance [47–49]. This
pathway has been closely associated with the initiation
and progression of many tumors, including melanoma
[47–49]. An imbalance in the PI3K-AKT pathway can
cause aberrant activation of the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), one of the most-extensively studied
downstream effectors of this pathway [50]. In mammalian
cells, mTOR is found in two functionally distinct protein
complexes – mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2
[51]. The protein complex (mTORC1), consisting of
mTOR, raptor and mLST8 serving as the upstream
kinase of p70S6K and 4E-BP1, regulates cellular growth
by integrating signals from growth factor receptors
and intracellular nutrients [52–55]. The second protein
complex mTORC2, composed of mTOR, Rictor, Sin1 and
others serves as the upstream kinase of AKT that is pivotal
in regulating cellular growth, migration and survival [56].
When mTORC1 activity is blocked by rapamycin and
its analogs, an encouraging clinical efficacy has been
seen in some types of cancers [50, 57], but the effects
are somewhat more modest in other cancers including
melanoma in pre-clinical settings and clinical trials [48,
58]. This may be largely due to the feedback activation of
the PI3K, mTORC2 and Erk-MAPK signaling pathways

upon mTORC1 inhibition [48, 57]. It has been reported
that itraconazole specifically inhibits the mTOR pathway
in endothelial cells via an antiangiogenic mechanism
[59]. We find that itraconazole can inhibit the activation
of mTORC1 effectively in melanoma cells, indicated by
decreased p-S6K and p-4E-BP1 levels in Western blots,
and attenuate mTORC2 activity as well, indicated by less
p-AKT-Ser473 under itraconazole treatment. These results
suggest that itraconazole may act as a dual inhibitor for the
PI3K-mTOR pathway in melanoma cells.
In mice xenograft model, we demonstrate that this
compound can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and repress
tumor colony formation in vitro, which is consistent
with reduction of tumor size and prolonged survival in
melanoma xenograft mice. Study of the mechanism of
anti-melanoma effects reveals that itraconazole acts on
the suppression of Hh, Wnt and AKT-mTOR pathways.
Thus, rational combination of this compound with other
chemo drugs that may target some specific tumorigenic
mechanism will be an effective strategy to enhance
conventional cancer therapy. The response doses of
itraconazole in mice examined in this experiment are
indeed higher than the commonly used therapeutic doses
(i.e., 400 mg/day orally for 15 days) in patients with
fungal infections, but are similar to itraconazole doses in
patients with severe fungal infections [60, 61], In these
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cases, a high dose of itraconazole ranging from 600 to 900
mg/day can be given to patients for 3 to 16 months with
close monitoring for any toxicity of this compound. With
high dose itraconazole in our mice model (75 and 100 mg/
kg), we find no signs of severe liver and kidney damage
except a slight elevation of serum cholesterol during the
20 days of treatment. In fact, the toxicity data suggests that
the side reactions of this compound are reversible with
dose adjustment [62].
Taken together, our study is the first to evaluate
itraconazole as possible inhibitor for melanoma in both
in vitro and in vivo models. The results suggest that this
agent has a potent anti-melanoma feature and may be very
useful to synergize other anti-cancer drugs by blocking the
Hh, Wnt and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway in melanoma
cells. Strategically, this may enhance the therapeutic
efficacy and prevent development of chemo resistance.

CCK-8 assay: A375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma
cells were seeded at a density of 6x103cells/well in a
96-well plate and were treated with itraconazole (~64
μM) in FBS-free medium, for 24, 48, and 72 hours.
Then cells were incubated with the Cell Counting Kit-8
solution (Yeasen, Shanghai, China) for two hours. Light
absorbance at a wavelength of 450nm was measured
using a Spectrra MAX 190 absorbance microplate reader
(Molecular Devices, California, USA). Experiments were
repeated at least three times in duplicates.
Cell counting assay: A375 and SK-MEL-28
melanoma cells were seeded at indicated density(1x103,
1x104, 1x105 cells/well)in a 6-well plate and were treated
with itraconazole (0, 1, 2, 4μM) in FBS-free medium,
for 48 hours. Then, cells were continuously cultured
in medium containing 10% FBS without itraconazole
for additional 5 days (1x104, 1x105 cells/wel) or 8 days
(1x103). Cells were stained with crystal violet for 30 min
and pictures were taken in at least five random microscopic

PCR amplification protocol was 95°C for 5 min, followed
by 30 or 35 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 55°C for 20 s, 72°C
for 30s and 72°C for 5 min as the final elongation step.
Amplified products were resolved by 1% agarose gel
electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide and
photographed under ultraviolet light. Primer sequences
are shown in the supplement materials. Details about the
primer sequences was shown in Table 1.

Colony formation assay in soft agar
A375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells in
logarithmic growth phase were trypsinized and suspended
into a single cell suspension. Bottom layer agar (0.6%)
preparation: 1.5 mL 1.2% agar was added into 1.5 mL
2X culture medium (with 20% lipid-depleted serum, 2X
antibiotics, 2X itraconazole 2, 4, 8 μM), mixed well,
laid onto a 6-well plate and allow to solidify at room
temperature. Upper layer agar (0.4%) preparation: 0.5
mL of 0.8% agar was mixed, added to 2X culture medium
(with 20% lipid-depleted serum, 2X antibiotics, 2X
itraconazole 2, 4, 8 μM) containing 103 cells, and laid
onto the bottom layer. Then plates were incubated for
14 days at 37 °C with 5 % CO2. Photograph of the well
plates were taken under a microscope and numbers of the
colonies were calculated.

Western blotting
A375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells were seeded
on 6-well plates in their respective medium and were
treated with itraconazole (0, 1, 2, 4 μM). After treatment,
medium was removed from attached cells and washed
twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in
RIPA lysis buffer kit (BestBio, shanghai, China), on ice
for 30 min. The lysates were collected and centrifuged
at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations
were detected using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit
(Multisciences, Hangzhou, China). Aliquots of the lysates
were boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on 10% SDSPAGE gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Merck
Millipore, Germany). The membrane was blocked with
1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h and then probed

MDD represents median day of death. Average percentage
weight change was used as a surrogate end point for
tolerability in all experiments. Toxicity was defined as ≥20%
of mice showing ≥20% body weight loss and/or mortality
[22].The health status of animals was checked daily, and
weights were recorded two to three times a week.

Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections
were prepared from xenografted tumors. Tissue samples
were sliced from paraffin blocks (5-μm sections),
deparaffinized three times in xylene for 5 min and
hydrated in a gradient ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%, and
50%). The sections were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H & E) for pathological examination. For
immunohistochemical staining, blocking of unspecific
peroxidase activity was performed for 30 min with 3%
H2O2 and 90% methanol. Citrate buffer (10 mM [pH 6])
was used for antigen retrieval. The rabbit monoclonal
anti-body Ki-67 (D2H10) (dilution 1:150; Cell Signaling,
Beverly, MA) was used. The primary antibody was
incubated overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, after being
washed with PBS, the biotinylated secondary antibody
was incubated for 30 min. The tissues were incubated
for 1 hr in an avidin–peroxidase complex (ABC, Vector
Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, USA). DAB with 5%
H2O2 was used for detection. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. All Slides were examined and
photographed under a light microscope.

Animal
Athymic nude female mice, ages 7 to 8 weeks,
weighing approximately 20 to 22 g, were purchased from
the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University.
The health of all animals was monitored daily by gross
observation and analysis of blood samples of sentinel
animals. All animal experiments were performed in
accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees and were performed
in accordance with the Animals in Research: Reporting
In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines for the care
and usage.

Melanoma xenografts
For the A375 xenografts, 2.5 × 106 cells in 0.2
mL of PBS were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into
the right lateral flank of mice, using a 12-gauge trocar
needle. The tumor cells grow and form tumors after
implantation. By day seven, the average volume of
tumors attained to nearly 100 mm3 without itraconazole
treatment. Drinking water was acidified. In itraconazole
group, mice with tumors were treated twice per day in
8-12 hr apart with itraconazole oral solution (10 mg/
ml) containing 40% (w/v) HPCD (2-hydroxypropylb-cyclodextrin), at the doses of 100, 75, 50 and 30 mg/
kg. Meanwhile, equal volumes of 40% (w/v) HPCD
solution was gavage twice daily in control mice group.
The tumor growth curve is determined by measuring the
tumor volume using the equation: Volume = (L×W2) /2.
At the end of the experiment, mice were euthanized and
tumors were excised for immunohistochemistry. All the
animal experiments were performed in accordance with
the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments
(ARRIVE) guidelines for the care and usage.

Necrosis scoring of melanoma
Hematoxylin and eosin stained (H&E) sections of
paraffin-embedded melanoma after the growth inhibition
study were examined for necrosis. Necrosis was scored as
follows: 0 = no evidence of necrosis with melanoma cells;
1 = mild necrosis with nuclear pyknosis; 2 = moderate
necrosis with < 25% necrosis; 3 = severe necrosis with >
25%necrosis. After evaluation of necrosis scores, pairwise
comparison between control and itraconazole treatment
melanoma were made using a two-sided unpaired t test
with GraphPad Prism software.

Ki-67 index
The Ki-67 index was determined in the most
proliferative area. In this “hot spot”, the percentage of
nuclear DAB stained cells was estimated in about 200
tumour cells. At least 10 high-power fields was selected
and calculated, the average positive cells (%) was treated
as Ki-67 proliferation index [23].

Efficacy and safety end points
Survival was evaluated using a predefined cutoff
volume of 2,000 mm3as a surrogate for mortality. The percent
increase in life span was calculated as follows: 100×[(MDDwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
