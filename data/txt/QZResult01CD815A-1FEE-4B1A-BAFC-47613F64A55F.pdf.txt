Abstract
Most malignant cells are poorly immunogenic and fail to elicit an effective antitumor immune response.
In contrast, viral infections of cells are promptly detected and eliminated by the immune system. Viral
recognition critically hinges on cytosolic nucleic acid receptors that include the proinflammatory RNA
helicase retinoic acid–inducible gene-I (RIG-I). Here, we show that targeted delivery of RIG-I agonists induced ovarian cancer cells to upregulate HLA class I and to secrete the proinflammatory cytokines
CXCL10, CCL5, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IFN-β. Ovarian cancer cells stimulated via
RIG-I became apoptotic and were readily phagocytosed by monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic
cells, which in turn upregulated HLA class I/II and costimulatory molecules and released CXCL10 and
IFN-α. Our findings offer proof of principle that mimicking viral infection in ovarian cancer cells triggers
an immunogenic form of tumor cell apoptosis that may enhance immunotherapy of ovarian cancer. Cancer

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of
death from gynecologic malignancies in developed countries.
Radical cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum/taxanebased chemotherapy constitutes the current standard of
care. Despite an initial response rate of 65% to 80% to
frontline therapy, recurrence arises in the majority of
cases, leading to a relative 5-year survival rate of only
47%. This situation warrants new therapeutic strategies
aimed at consolidating the initial clinical response. Indeed,
currently explored approaches to the management of EOC
include neoadjuvant chemotherapy (1), molecular-based
treatments, and dose-intense approaches such as intraperitoneal therapy (2). Moreover, given the consistent observation that the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) in EOC patients is correlated with improved survival
(3–5), efforts to design effective immunotherapies are

under way (6, 7). In this context, the targeted activation
of innate immune receptors to induce and promote antitumor immune reactivity to prevent tumor recurrence and
progression seems promising (8). In recent years, a range
of viruses has been manipulated toward oncolytic function
and evaluated for the capacity to selectively induce cancer
cell apoptosis and to elicit antitumor immune activity (9).
We hypothesized that engaging the same potent antiviral
immune mechanisms by delivering noninfectious agonists
of the helicase retinoic acid–inducible gene-I (RIG-I) could
be similarly effective while avoiding the potential risk of
infection of healthy tissue.
Virus detection critically depends on pattern recognition
receptors that recognize viral nucleic acids in distinct cellular compartments. In the cytosol, these receptors include the
RNA-sensing receptors RIG-I (10) and melanoma differentiation antigen-5 (MDA-5; ref. 11) as well as DNA-identifying
members, namely, absent in melanoma 2 and other yet unidentified receptors (12, 13). Engagement of these cytosolic
nucleic acid receptors not only triggers the release of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines but also
leads to the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis in susceptible cell types, including tumor cells, in a process mediated
by IRF-3, Apaf-1, and caspase-9, as well as the proapoptotic
Bcl-2 family member Noxa (14–16).
In this study, we used short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
with an uncapped 5′-triphosphate (3pRNA; refs. 17, 18), a direct RIG-I agonist, as well as the synthetic dsDNA polydeoxyadenosine-deoxythymidine [poly(dAdT)], which has been
shown to stimulate human cells via RIG-I following a DNA
polymerase III–mediated transcription into 5′-triphosphate

RNA (19, 20). We found that EOC cells stimulated by either
RIG-I ligand undergo an immune activating form of cell
death. Monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells
(MoDC) that engulfed such apoptotic cancer cells matured
and secreted proinflammatory chemokines as well as type I
IFN. Thus, RIG-I agonists were able to directly destroy EOC
cells while, at the same time, enhancing immune reactivity,
opening new perspectives for the treatment of EOC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The human EOC cell lines IGROV-1 (21) and SKOV-3 (22)
were cultured in cell line medium (see Supplementary Materials and Methods) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2
atmosphere under strictly endotoxin-free conditions. The
identity of each cell line was verified by flow cytometry at
regular intervals.
Ascites-derived EOC cell cultures
Ascites was collected at the time of surgical treatment
from therapy-naive patients with EOC (serous papillary).
Cell cultures were established modifying a previously
published technique (23). Briefly, cells isolated from ascites
were cultured in cell culture medium (see Supplementary Materials and Methods), and on the formation of confluent cell
monolayers, cancer cells were enriched using anti–epithelial
cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) microbeads (Miltenyi). A
total of five ovarian cancer cell (OVCACE-1 to OVCACE-5)
cultures was newly derived for this study. Morphology of cancer cells was visualized using Axio Observer.D1 microscope
and AxioVision Rel.4.7 software (Carl Zeiss). The identity of
each culture was verified by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. The ethics committee of the University of Bonn
approved the study protocol, and all patients gave written
consent.
Monocytes, MoDCs, and FastDCs
Monocytes were enriched from buffy coat–derived
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy
blood donors using the monocyte isolation kit II (Miltenyi).
A purity of >98% was achieved, as determined by flow
cytometry. Monocytes were maintained in monocyte medium
(see Supplementary Materials and Methods). For MoDC cultures, monocytes were purified from PBMCs using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi) and cultured under serum-free conditions
(see Supplementary Materials and Methods). Where indicated,
DCs were generated from monocytes by short-term culture
(FastDCs) as described previously (24).
Stimulation
The RIG-I ligand 3pRNA was generated by in vitro transcription as described previously (17). Poly(dAdT) (SigmaAldrich) was used as RIG-I/cytosolic DNA receptor agonist
(13, 19, 20, 25). The synthetic dsRNA polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (InvivoGen) was used as MDA-5 agonist
(26). Cytosolic stimuli were transfected using FuGENE HD
(Roche), TransIT-LT1 (Mirus), or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invi-

trogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Polyadenosine [poly(A); Sigma-Aldrich] was used as nonstimulatory control for transfection. Toll-like receptor (TLR)
ligands were bacterial lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia
coli (InvivoGen) for TLR4 (27), R848 for TLR7/8 (28, 29),
and the CpG oligodeoxynucleotide M362 (Metabion) for
TLR9 (30). The TLR3 agonist polyadenosine-uridine [poly
(A:U); ref. 31] was prepared by dissolving equal amounts
of poly(A) and polyuridine (Sigma-Aldrich) and heating
the mixture to 55°C for 3 minutes. UV irradiation and
chemotherapeutic drugs were used at indicated doses
(see Supplementary Materials and Methods; 32).
Cell viability and apoptosis assays
Viable cells were quantified using the CellTiter-Blue reagent
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).
Apoptosis was assessed by staining with Annexin-V-FLUOS
(Roche) in conjunction with propidium iodide or Hoechst
33258 (33). Fragmentation of genomic DNA was evaluated
by permeabilizing cells in absolute ethanol and staining with
propidium iodide in the presence of DNase-free RNase A (34).
Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) were
assessed using the MitoProbe DiOC2 (3) assay kit according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).
Coculture experiments
Apoptosis was induced in tumor cells by adding ligands of
RIG-I for 4 hours. Cells were then washed thoroughly and
cocultured with monocytes in a 1:2 ratio or with MoDCs and
FastDCs in a 1:1 ratio. The fluorescence-labeled antibody
against EpCAM was used to exclude tumor cells from analysis.
Phagocytosis assay
Tumor cells were labeled with the membrane dye PKH26
(Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer's instructions;
18 hours after induction of apoptosis, tumor cells were cocultured for 4 hours with monocytes, which were then stained
for CD14 and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Measurement of cytokines and chemokines
Secretion of IFN-α (Bender MedSystems), IFN-β (Invitrogen), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6,
IL-10, and CXCL10 (IP-10; BD Biosciences) was quantified
in cell-free supernatants by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The detection of CCL5 (RANTES) was
performed using the cytometric bead array (CBA; BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Flow cytometry
A list of used antibodies is provided in Supplementary Table
S1. Data were obtained on a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) evaluating at least 20,000 events per sample by gating
on Hoechst 33258–negative cells after excluding doublets. Analysis was performed by FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Immunoblot analysis
Cell lysates were immunoblotted following standard protocols. A list of used antibodies is provided in Supplementary

RIG-I Promotes Immunogenic Tumor Cell Death

Table S3. Analysis was performed using the Odyssey IR imaging system (LI-COR).
RNA extraction and quantification
Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol as
described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RNA (1 μg)
was digested with 2 units of DNase I, and cDNA was
synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase and oligo(dT) 18 primer according to the
manufacturer's recommendations (Fermentas). Quantitative
PCR was performed on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems) together with SYBR Green
qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas). GAPDH was used as housekeeping gene. PCR products were verified by melting curve
analysis, and relative quantification was done with SDS Software Rev. 2.3 (Applied Biosystems). A list of used primers is
provided in Supplementary Table S4.
Immunocytochemistry
A Shandon cytospin 4 cytocentrifuge (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) transferred cells to microscope slides. Staining
was performed on an automated staining system (TechMate
500; Dako) using the streptavidin-biotin complex method.
Antibodies are summed up in Supplementary Table S2. Immunostained cells were analyzed with an IX71 microscope
and CellF software (Olympus).
Statistical analysis
Values are given as mean ± SE. The F test was used to
check the assumption of equal variances; the unpaired onetailed Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used
to determine statistical significance of differences. Results
with a P value of ≤0.05 were considered to be significant.

Results
EOC cell lines are sensitive to RIG-I–triggered
apoptosis
Induction of apoptosis is not only a common feature
of anticancer agents but also a key element in the cellautonomous responses to virus infection. Engagement of innate immune receptors has been shown to play a pivotal role
in transmitting proapoptotic signals after viral stimulation
(14–16). Our objective was therefore to determine whether
synthetic agonists of RIG-I were able to induce cytopathic
cell death in EOC cells. We monitored two EOC cell lines
(IGROV-1 and SKOV-3) for cell viability following the transfection with a direct and an indirect agonist of RIG-I, namely,
3pRNA (17, 18) and poly(dAdT) that is transcribed intracellularly into RIG-I agonistic RNA (19, 20). We found that both direct and indirect RIG-I ligands induced tumor cell death in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To test whether the decrease in cell survival was due to apoptosis, EOC cell lines
were assayed by flow cytometry using Annexin V and propidium iodide, which revealed a pronounced externalization of
phosphatidylserine in response to RIG-I agonists (Fig. 1B). In
addition, we measured the hypodiploid DNA peak indicative
for late-stage apoptosis. In accordance with above results all

RIG-I ligands induced significant apoptotic DNA fragmentation [3pRNA, P < 0.04; poly(dAdT), P < 0.009; Fig. 1C and D].
We obtained similar data for both EOC cell lines (Fig. 1C). In
contrast, none of the TLR agonists tested were able to induce
apoptosis of EOC cells (Fig. 1D).
Malignant ascites contains primary EOC cells as well
as tumor-associated immune cells
A common pathway of tumor spread in advanced EOC is
direct dissemination into the peritoneal cavity. Triggered by
this intraperitoneal carcinomatosis, substantial populations
of immune cells migrate to the peritoneal cavity. The cellular
content of ascitic fluid is therefore considered a model for
the tumor microenvironment. We analyzed the cellular composition of ascites in previously untreated EOC by flow cytometry. In all patient samples tested, CD45+ immune cells
constituted the largest cellular population, which indicates
tumor-dependent immune activation; the remaining CD45negative cells consisted of CD90+ mesothelial cells/fibroblasts and EpCAM+ tumor cells that stained positive for
the tumor markers folate receptor α (FRα) and/or CA125
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Within the immune infiltrate, the
major population was of the T-cell lineage with a mean CD4to-CD8 ratio of 1.9 (range, 0.59–6.11); another significant immune cell population comprised CD14+HLA-DR+ monocytes,
important effectors of innate immunity (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Thus, the presence of tumor-associated immune
cells is indicative of an immune response provoked by the
presence of the tumor but also provides the rationale for a
therapeutic approach that aims to boost the immune system
to target and destroy cancer cells within this milieu.
Because indefinitely passaged cell lines as the ones used
in Fig. 1 can produce results critically different from effects obtained with primary cancer specimens, we next
fractionated ascites of therapy-naive patients to derive
EOC cell cultures. Tumor cells generated from five individual patients grew in culture with a uniform cobblestone
pattern indicative of their epithelial origin (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). Accordingly, cells stained positive for epithelial
antigen and EpCAM (Supplementary Fig. S1D and E). To confirm their identity as cancer cells, we repeatedly tested up to
passage 56 and consistently found that >99% of the cells in
culture expressed tumor antigens FRα and CA125 at high
levels (Supplementary Fig. S1D and E). Moreover, homogenous expression of these cell surface markers indicated the
absence of contaminating cell types (Supplementary Fig. S1E).
Ascites-derived EOC cells are sensitive to RIG-I–
triggered apoptosis
Using ascites-derived EOC cell cultures, we next evaluated
the proapoptotic effects of RIG-I ligand delivery. Consistent
with results in cell lines, tumor cells derived directly from
patient samples underwent apoptosis on engagement of
RIG-I (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the doses required for apoptosis
induction in ascites-derived EOC cell cultures were similar
to those used in cell lines. A significant increase of early apoptotic populations (Annexin V positive/Hoechst 33258 negative) was observed with both direct and indirect RIG-I

RIG-I Promotes Immunogenic Tumor Cell Death

derived from malignant ascites and showed characteristics of early- and late-stage apoptosis 24 h after treatment with RIG-I agonists 3pRNA and poly(dAdT)

agonists in a dose-dependent manner [3pRNA, P < 0.002; poly
(dAdT), P < 0.01; Fig. 2B]. We further analyzed the degree of
late-stage apoptosis and showed that treatment with each
RIG-I agonist significantly increased the frequency of cells
with DNA fragmentation [3pRNA, P < 0.03; poly(dAdT), P <
0.002; Fig. 2C and D]. This effect was consistent in all
patient-derived EOC cell cultures (Fig. 2C). In accordance with
published results of apoptosis after activation of nucleic acid
receptors (14–16), we observed upregulation of Noxa (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and monitored disruption of ΔΨm at an
early stage in RIG-I–triggered EOC cells, which is associated
with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [8 h: 3pRNA, P < 0.02;
poly(dAdT), P < 0.05; 11 h: 3pRNA, P < 0.008; poly(dAdT), P <
0.05; Supplementary Fig. S2B]. Moreover, cleaved caspase-9 and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 were evident in lysates of RIG-I
agonist–treated EOC cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In comparison, EOC cells were also subjected to TLR4, TLR7, and
TLR9 ligands, which did not result in an increase of apoptosis
(Fig. 2D). Finally, we evaluated the proapoptotic function of
poly(A:U), which was shown to trigger cell death in human
breast cancer cells via TLR3 (35, 36) and was able to promote
antitumor immune reactivity in mouse tumor models (36).
However, up to concentrations of 100 mg/mL, poly(A:U) did
not exert proapoptotic function in IGROV-1 and patientderived EOC cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).
EOC cells upregulate HLA class I molecules and secrete
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in
response to RIG-I agonists
We characterized immunogenic properties of RIG-I–
stimulated cancer cells by determining expression status
of HLA molecules. Constitutive expression of HLA class I
antigens on EOC cells was found to be on a low level and
only modestly upregulated after treatment with poly(A);
stimulation via RIG-I, however, significantly enhanced the
expression of HLA class I antigens in a dose-dependent
manner [3pRNA, P < 0.05; poly(dAdT), P < 0.05; Fig. 3A].
We next evaluated whether treatment with RIG-I agonists
initiated EOC cells to secrete cytokines and chemokines
able to modulate tumor-specific immune responses. We
found that RIG-I ligand-treated EOC cells released significant amounts of IFN-β [3pRNA, P = 0.05; poly(dAdT),
P = 0.05], CXCL10 [3pRNA, P < 0.002; poly(dAdT),
P < 0.04], CCL5 [3pRNA, P < 0.006; poly( dAdT),
P < 0.0003], IL-6 [3pRNA, P < 0.002; poly(dAdT),
P < 0.0003], and TNF-α [3pRNA, P < 0.002; poly(dAdT),
P < 0.0003] in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B and C).
In contrast, IFN-α release by RIG-I–stimulated EOC cells
was never detected (data not shown).
Monocytes exposed to RIG-I agonist–induced apoptotic
EOC cells become activated and secrete
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines
Monocytes were the dominant phagocytic cell type attracted into malignant ascites (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
In coculture experiments, we therefore asked whether
monocytes reacted to an exposure to RIG-I agonist–
induced apoptotic EOC cells and analyzed monocyte

5298

Cancer Res; 70(13) July 1, 2010

expression of HLA molecules and activation markers. We
found that contact to RIG-I–triggered apoptotic EOC cells
augmented HLA class I and II expression on monocytes
and upregulated surface levels of CD69 and CD86 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Further, we characterized the cytokine
and chemokine response of monocytes exposed to apoptotic tumor cells. Incubation of monocytes with RIGI–stimulated EOC cells resulted in significantly higher
levels of CXCL10 {coculture with poly(A)-treated tumor cells
[3pRNA, P < 0.04; poly(dAdT), P < 0.0006], directly treated
monocytes [3pRNA, P < 0.02; poly(dAdT), P < 0.002], and
directly treated tumor cells [poly(dAdT), P < 0.004]; Fig.
4A} and IFN-α {coculture with poly(A)-treated tumor cells
[3pRNA, P < 0.004; poly(dAdT), P < 0.0009]; Fig. 4B}.
Increase of CXCL10 concentration following incubation
with 3pRNA-induced apoptotic cells was clear; however,
it did not reach significance when contrasted to directly
treated tumor cells (P = 0.35). Importantly, the low chemokine secretion by monocytes stimulated directly was
not due to monocyte apoptosis because RIG-I agonist–
treated monocytes showed very low percentages of Annexin V–positive or DNA-laddered cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5A; data not shown) compared with apoptosis in
ascites-derived EOC cells [3pRNA, P < 0.05; poly(dAdT),
P < 0.002; Supplementary Fig. S5B]. We further observed
that in the presence of apoptotic EOC cells, monocytes
secreted IL-10, a major mediator of immunosuppression
in the tumor microenvironment. We found, however, IL10 secretion was significantly decreased when monocytes
were cocultured with RIG-I agonist–induced apoptotic
tumor cells [3pRNA, P < 0.005; poly(dAdT), P < 0.002;
Supplementary Fig. S4B].
In contrast to these findings, most forms of apoptosis
are thought to lack the inflammatory signals required to
induce activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC). However, anthracycline chemotherapy agents such as doxorubicin have previously been shown to induce an immunogenic
form of cell death that involves cell surface exposure of
calreticulin by tumor cells (37). We therefore compared
monocyte activation following the ingestion of RIG-I–
triggered and doxorubicin-induced apoptotic tumor cells.
Treatment with either doxorubicin or RIG-I agonists
induced apoptosis of EOC cells (data not shown). At
the doses used, both types of tumor cell death inducers
similarly enhanced the phagocytic uptake of apoptotic
material by monocytes [3pRNA, P < 0.02; poly(dAdT),
P < 0.04; doxorubicin, P < 0.02; Fig. 5A and B]. Our results
suggest that fluorescence was acquired by phagocytosis
rather than by mere surface binding of apoptotic cells, as
doublet events were excluded, the acquired fluorescence
of monocytes always remained lower than that of tumor
cells alone, and the process was considerably inhibited at
4°C, a temperature that blocks engulfment but not surface
adhesion (Fig. 5A and B; data not shown). Despite the similar characteristics of monocyte uptake, surface expression
of calreticulin on EOC cells was provoked by doxorubicin
treatment (P < 0.002) but not by RIG-I stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S6). Conversely, exclusively the engulfment of

rapidly differentiate into DCs. This process is poorly mirrored in the protocols commonly used for DC derivation
from monocytes in vitro. We therefore evaluated the influence of RIG-I–stimulated apoptotic tumor cells on monocytes undergoing accelerated transformation into DCs
(FastDCs; ref. 24). We found that even short-time exposure
of monocytes to tumor cells undergoing RIG-I–induced apoptosis showed upregulation of HLA class I and II, as well
as of CD86 (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Direct engagement of
RIG-I has been shown to lead to cytokine secretion [3pRNA,
P < 0.0001; poly(dAdT), P < 0.002] and maturation of immature MoDCs (Supplementary Fig. S8A; refs. 18, 19). We next

evaluated whether RIG-I–stimulated apoptotic tumor cells
were also able to promote the functional maturation of
immature MoDCs. We found that coculture with RIG-I
agonist–triggered apoptotic tumor cells significantly
enhanced DC surface expression of HLA class II molecules
[3pRNA, P < 0.02; poly(dAdT), P < 0.006], the DC maturation
marker CD83 [3pRNA, P < 0.03; poly(dAdT), P = 0.05],
as well as the costimulatory molecules CD86 [3pRNA,
P < 0.002; poly(dAdT), P < 0.02] and CD80 [poly(dAdT),
P < 0.05; Fig. 6A]. We also noticed a clear increase in
the upregulation of CD80 following the incubation with
3pRNA-mediated apoptotic tumor cells that did not reach

significance (P = 0.33). Similar to our observation in monocytes, incubation with RIG-I–stimulated apoptotic EOC cells,
but not with doxorubicin- or UV-induced apoptotic EOC cells,
induced IFN-α production in MoDCs [3pRNA, P < 0.04; poly
(dAdT), P < 0.02; Fig. 6B]. MoDC upregulation of the maturation markers CD86 and CD83 was also most prominent
in cocultures with RIG-I–stimulated apoptotic EOC cells
compared with cultures with doxorubicin- or UV-induced
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S9).

Discussion
We have shown that the cytosolic innate immune receptor
RIG-I can effectively be engaged in EOC cells to promote tumor apoptosis. Whereas most forms of apoptosis are considered “immunologically silent” and tolerogenic (39), cell death
initiated by RIG-I agonists was highly immune stimulatory
with apoptotic tumor cells not only secreting proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines but also inducing functional maturation and type I IFN secretion of APCs. By this approach, synergistically interlocking mechanisms of both cell-autonomous
and immune cell–mediated antitumor reactivity are engaged.
Many immune and nonimmune cell types are able to sense
RNA viral presence in the cytosol via RIG-I. We found that
both established EOC cell lines and patient-derived EOC cell
cultures were similarly susceptible to RIG-I–induced apoptosis, indicating that during malignant transformation this
pathway remains functional and amenable to therapeutic intervention. Our data on RIG-I–triggered cell death in EOC cells are
in accordance with recent studies describing proapoptotic activity of MDA-5 and RIG-I engagement in human and mouse
melanoma cell lines (14, 16, 40). Yet, whereas melanomas evade
immune detection and are characteristically devoid of immune
cell infiltrates, EOC elicits cytotoxic immune reactivity, and
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes are associated with improved survival (3–5). Thus, induction of immunogenic apoptosis is particularly plausible in EOC to shift the balance away
from tumor-induced immune suppression toward enhancement of cytotoxic antitumor immune responses. Accordingly,
although downregulation of HLA class I expression is a common feature in EOC and correlated with a poor prognostic outcome (41), we show that RIG-I ligation induced upregulation of
HLA class I. RIG-I–engaged EOC cells additionally secreted
proinflammatory mediators. In particular, the release of
CXCL10 attracting TIL has been reported to be associated
with an improved overall clinical outcome in EOC (3).
Consequentially, EOC cell apoptosis triggered by pathways
of virus detection is able to strongly activate human phagocytic cells that then secrete IFN-α, whose pleiotropic antiviral effects promote antitumor activity (42). Moreover,

monocytes that ingested RIG-I–induced apoptotic tumor
cells showed decreased secretion of IL-10, a major contributor of immunosuppression in tumor microenvironment that
was shown to be induced by the mere presence of EOC cells
(43). Whether monocytes and DCs matured in this fashion,
also present tumor antigens, and effectively expand cytotoxic
TIL will be the subject of future study.
Together, our data provide a framework for clinical studies to
evaluate the potential of RIG-I agonists as immunotherapeutic
agents for EOC. Because selected chemotherapeutic drugs are
similarly able to cause immunogenic tumor cell apoptosis
in mouse models, interest has renewed in harnessing this
desirable form of tumor cell death for immunotherapy (44).
The usually good initial response to surgery and combination
chemotherapy in EOC points toward a window of opportunity
for immunotherapeutic intervention, in which residual tumor
burden and tumor-induced immune suppression are minimal.
A recent study showed that cytoreductive surgery of the primary tumor relieves immune suppression and decreases the frequency of circulating regulatory T cells (45). Moreover, in
EOC patients who have recovered from chemotherapy, antitumor cytotoxic T cells can be restimulated in vitro comparably
well as in healthy volunteers (46). Based on our findings, clinical
trials evaluating efficacy of RIG-I agonists may consider intraperitoneal application. However, it is unclear whether apoptosis-inducing concentrations of RIG-I–stimulatory nucleic acids
can safely be achieved in few residual EOC cells in vivo. An alternative approach we favor for future development is to generate
an autologous DC vaccine, loaded in vitro with RIG-I–induced
apoptotic EOC cells derived from the patient's ascites.
