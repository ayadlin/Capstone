ABSTRACT
Exosomes have been shown to transmit drug resistance through delivering
miRNAs. We aimed to explore their roles in breast cancer. Three resistant sublines
were established by exposing parental MDA-MB-231 cell line to docetaxel, epirubicin
and vinorelbine, respectively. Preneoadjuvant chemotherapy biopsies and paired
surgically-resected specimens embedded in paraffin from 23 breast cancer patients
were collected. MiRNA expression profiles of the cell lines and their exosomes were
evaluated using microarray. The result showed that most miRNAs in exosomes had a
lower expression level than that in cells, however, some miRNAs expressed higher in
exosomes than in cells, suggesting a number of miRNAs is concentrated in exosomes.
Among the dysregulated miRNAs, 22 miRNAs were consistently up-regulated in
exosomes and their cells of origin. We further found that 12 of the 22 miRNAs were
significantly up-regulated after preneoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further study of the
role of these 12 miRNAs in acquisition of drug resistance is needed to clarify their
contribution to chemoresistance.

reprogramming of the recipient cells [6]. Our previously
study suggested that drug-resistant breast cancer cells may
spread resistance capacity to sensitive ones by releasing
exosomes and that such effects could be partly attributed
to the intercellular transfer of specific miRNAs [5, 8–10].
In present study, we established three drug resistance
sublines from parental MDA-MB-231 cell line to explore
miRNA expression profiles of drug-resistance breast cancer
cells and their exosomes and their association with drug
resistance. Preneoadjuvant chemotherapy biopsies and
paired surgically-resected specimens from 23 breast cancer
patients were collected and detected for the expression of
22 specific selected miRNAs to investigate whether these
miRNAs are associated with drug resistance in vivo.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is one of the most commonly
diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death
among females worldwide. Breast cancer alone accounts
for 25% of all cancer cases and 15% of all cancer deaths
among females [1]. Chemotherapy is commonly used in
the treatment of breast cancers [2]. Nevertheless, many
patients resistant to chemotherapy prior to drug treatment
or develop resistance following treatment [3]. Despite
much effort has been made, the underlying mechanisms
of acquiring drug resistance are still poorly understood.
Recently, exosomes attract more attention as a novel
mode of intercellular communication. Exosomes are small,
lipid bilayer membrane vesicles 50 to 100 nm in diameter
[4, 5]. Accumulating evidence indicates that exosomes play
important roles in cancer, including tumorigenesis, growth,
progression, metastasis, and drug resistance [4, 6, 7].
Exosomes can shuttle bioactive molecules including
proteins and genetic cargo, especially low molecular weight
RNA named microRNA (miRNA, miR) from one cell to
another, leading to the exchange of genetic information and

treated with the drugs at different concentrations for
48h, cell viability was examined by MTT assay and
50% inhibition concentration (IC50) was calculated.
The results showed that the resistant sublines were
less sensitive than MDA-MB-231/S to the drugs used
to select them and also cross-resistant to the other two
drugs (Table 1).

The miRNA expression profiles of the MDAMB-231 cell lines and their exosomes were evaluated using
Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0 Array. Supplementary
Table S1 and Supplementary Table S2 present expression
level of miRNAs in the four cell lines and their exosomes,
respectively. Compared with MDA-MB-231/S cell line,
there were respectively 121, 141 and 123 differentially
expressed miRNAs (at least 2.0-fold changes) in MDAMB-231/Doc, MDA-MB-231/Epi, and MDA-MB-231/
Nvb cell lines. Regarding exosomes, 351, 216 and 112
differentially expressed miRNAs were found, respectively,
in Exosomes/Doc, Exosomes/Epi, and Exosomes/Nvb
when compared with Exosomes/S. Hierarchical cluster
analysis revealed that the cell lines and their exosomes
were characterized by significant changes in miRNA ex­
pression (Supplementary Figure S1).

Exosomes characterization
By transmission electron microscopy, exosomes
appear with characteristic doughnut morphology,
and their diameter ranges between 50 and 100 nm
(Figure 1A). A bioanalyzer profile on total RNA from
exosomes and their cells of origin revealed that RNAs
isolated from exosomes were small-sized RNAs and
lacked bands corresponding to cellular 18S and 28S
ribosomal RNAs (Figure 1C).

The scatter-plots of the microarray signal values of
between cell lines and between exosomes are shown in
Supplementary Figure S2. The scatter plot that showed
a correlation between the three resistant sublines and
MDA-MB-231/S and between exosomes isolated from
resistant sublines and Exosomes/S, although there were
a lot of differentially expressed miRNAs. However, the
scatter plot comparing the expression level of miRNAs
between cells and exosomes showed that most miRNAs
in exosomes had a lower expression level than that in
cells, nevertheless, some miRNAs expressed higher
in exosomes than in cells, suggesting that a number of
miRNAs is concentrated in exosomes (Supplementary
Figure S3).
Figure 2 presents fold change of miRNA expression
level in the three resistance sublines relative to MDA-MB231/S cell line vs. that in exosomes. From the Figure 2, we
can easily found that some of the miRNAs exhibited similar
or consistent expression changes in resistance cell lines and
their exosomes, and the others either were dysregulated
only in one of them, or showed changes in opposite
directions. Among the dysregulated miRNAs, there were 10
consistently up-regulated miRNAs in MDA-MB-231/Doc
cells and their exosomes (hsa-miR-1246, hsa-miR-1268a,
hsa-miR-149-3p, hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-4298, hsa-

miR-4438, hsa-miR-4644, hsa-miR-671-5p, hsa-miR-71075p and hsa-miR-7847-3p), 11 miRNAs in MDA-MB-231/
Epi cells and their exosomes (hsa-miR-138-5p, hsa-miR139-5p, hsa-miR-197-3p, hsa-miR-210-3p, hsa-miR-3178,
hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-4258, hsa-miR-4443, hsa-miR574-3p, hsa-miR-6780b-3p and hsa-miR-744-5p), and 4
miRNAs in MDA-MB-231/Nvb cells and their exosomes
(hsa-miR-138-5p, hsa-miR-140-3p, hsa-miR-210-3p and
hsa-miR-3613-5p). The following analyses will focus on
these 22 miRNAs.

RT-qPCR validation of microarray results
We used RT-qPCR to confirm the expression of the
22 consistently up-regulated miRNAs mentioned above.
We failed to detect an expression of hsa-miR-671-5p in
both cells and their exosomes. The RT-qPCR results of the
rest 21 miRNAs showed good consistency with microarray
results.

patients with progressive disease (PD). We detected the
expression of the 22 miRNAs in the 23 paired specimens
from these patients to explore whether these miRNAs are
associated with drug resistance in vivo. Because about a
half of the specimens were failed to detect an expression
of hsa-miR-3613-5p and hsa-miR-4438, and only 8
specimens were detected an expression of hsa-miR-6715p, we removed the 3 miRNAs from present statistical
analysis (Supplementary Table S3). Our results showed
that the expression level of the rest 19 miRNAs was
up-regulated after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, despite 7
miRNAs did not reach a statistical significance (Table 3,
Figure 3). When we compared miRNA expression level
in SD/PD group with that of in PR group, only hsa-miR574-3p in surgically-resected specimens had significantly
up-regulated expression (P=0.027).

software V3.1.1 was used to decipher the KEGG pathway
and understand their biological functions. The predicted
target genes of the 8 miRNAs among the 12 miRNAs
were enriched in 17 pathways with P-value less than 0.05
(Figure 4, Supplementary Table S4).

DISCUSSION
MiRNA expression profile is a useful tool to
acquire potential key miRNAs implicating in various
aspects of cancer or other diseases. In previous study,
we have screened different expressed miRNAs between
parental MCF-7 cell line and drug resistant sublines using
microarray and found miR-222 and miR-29a contributed
to drug resistance of MCF-7 cells [13]. As our results
showed that drug resistant breast cancer cells can deliver
miRNAs to sensitive ones by releasing exosomes [5, 8, 10],
exosomes carrying up-regulated miR-222 or/and miR-29a
may be a transfer mechanism of resistance capacity to
sensitive cells. Our following study has confirmed that the
delivery of miR-222 via exosomes is a potential mechanism
of transmitting drug resistance [9]. Besides miRNAs,
exosomes also carry mRNA, enzymes or proteins, which
might be another mechanism of spreading resistance

Analysis of involved pathways
To identify which pathways might be involved in
resistance formation, the target genes of the 12 miRNAs
listed in Table 3 with a P-value <0.05 were compared with
the whole reference gene background. Then, Cytoscape

capacity [19]. We found that delivering P-gp via exosomes
could transmit drug resistance [12]. Taken together, drug
resistant cells could spread chemoresistance to sensitive
ones by exosomal miRNAs or proteins. In present study,
MDA-MB-231 cell lines were used to explore the roles of
exosomes and miRNAs in acquiring resistance to Doc, Epi,
and Nvb.
We analyzed miRNA expression profiles of exo­
somes and their cells of origin. The results showed that
most miRNAs in exosomes had a lower expression level
than that in cells, however, some miRNAs expressed
higher in exosomes than in cells, suggesting that a number
of miRNAs is concentrated in exosomes. We hypothesis
that miRNAs up-regulated in both resistance cell lines and
their exosomes may play an important role in acquisition
of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. We obtained 22
consistently up-regulated miRNAs in exosomes and their
cells of origin.
We further explored the 22 up-regulated miRNAs
in vivo. Our results showed that 12 of the 22 miRNAs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

were significantly up-regulated after preneoadjuvant
chemotherapy. However, only hsa-miR-574-3p was
statistically up-regulated in SD/PD group compared to
PR group. There are several potential reasons why the
rest miRNAs did not reach a statistical significance. First,
these included patients had different baseline expression
levels of these miRNAs. Second, the patients vary in age,
breast cancer stage, and chemotherapy regimen. Third,
the effect of miRNAs in vivo may differ from in vitro.
Fourth, the sample size is too small to detect statistical
significance.
We employed pathway mapping tool to identify
predominant pathways of the gene targets of the 12
miRNAs mentioned above. The result showed that the
predicted target genes of 8 miRNAs were enriched in
17 pathways. Among the 8 miRNAs, hsa-miR-4443
interfering with maximum pathways may play more
roles than the other miRNAs. Among the 17 pathways,
p53 [20], Wnt [21], MAPK [22], and ErbB [23] signaling
pathways have been confirmed to be involved in drug

the four pathways in Supplementary Table S4 might be
the potential mechanism of acquiring drug-resistance,
which was worth further exploration by experimental
studies. Whether or not other pathways and the following
targets (Supplementary Table S4) also implicated in drugresistance needs further investigation in the future.
In conclusion, we identified 12 miRNAs that may
contribute to drug resistance of breast cancer. Drugresistant breast cancer cells may spread resistance capacity
to sensitive ones by releasing exosomes containing these
miRNAs. Further studies uncovering the mechanisms of
these miRNAs contributing to chemoresistance would
help prevent or reverse chemoresistance in patients who
receive chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.

added to each well and mixed to ensure cell lysis and to
dissolve the formazan crystal. At last, the absorbance at
550 nm was measured using CliniBio128 (ASYS-Hitech,
Austria). Three replications of each experiment were
performed.

Isolation and identification of exosomes
Exosomes were isolated from culture medium of
MDA-MB-231/S, MDA-MB-231/Doc, MDA-MB-231/
Epi, and MDA-MB-231/Nvb cultured in exosome-free
FBS prepared by ultracentrifugation at 110,000g for 16
hours. The terms Exosomes/S, Exosomes/Doc, Exosomes/
Epi, and Exosomes/Nvb in the following text refers to
exosomes extracted from culture medium of corresponding
MDA-MB-231 cells. Exosomes were isolated using
repeated centrifugation, and ultracentrifugation. Briefly,
the culture medium was centrifuged at 2,000g for 15
minutes to eliminate cells, and then centrifuged at
16,500g for 30 minutes to get rid of debris. Exosomes
were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 110,000g for 120
minutes. The final pellets, comprised of exosomes, were
used immediately or resuspended in 1mL PBS and stored
at -80°C.
The exosomes were confirmed under electron
microscopy as our previous reports [5, 8, 12]. In short,
10μL exosomes were dripped onto parafilm and covered
by a 300-mesh copper grid for 45 min. After washing
three times with PBS, the copper mesh was fixed in 3%
glutaraldehyde for 10 min, washed with double distilled
water, and contrasted in 2% uranyl acetate. Images were
captured by a JEM-1010 electron microscope (JEOL,
Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and development of resistant sublines
Human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was
purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The identities of cell lines
were confirmed by the Cell Bank using DNA profiling
(short tandem repeat, STR). Docetaxel (Doc) resistant
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer subline (MDA-MB-231/
Doc) was developed from the parental MDA-MB-231 cell
line (MDA-MB-231/S) by increasing Doc concentration
from 0.2 nM to 13 nM in our laboratory in about twelve
months, epirubicin (Epi) resistant subline (MDA-MB-231/
Epi) was established by exposing to Epi from 10 nM to
800 nM, and vinorelbine (Nvb) resistant subline (MDAMB-231/Nvb) by exposing to Nvb from 10 nM to 1.4 μM.
All the cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) high glucose (HyClone)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/
mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C and
5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The drug resistant
derivative cell lines were cultured in drug free medium
for two weeks before subsequent experiments to avoid the
influence of the drug.

Isolation and profiling of miRNA from
exosomes and their cells of origin
Cells in logarithmic phase were collected when a
confluence of 80-90% was reached, and then total RNA
including miRNAs was extracted from the cells using
MirVana miRNA isolation Kit (Ambion, USA). RNA
recovery from the exosome samples was performed
with the Total Exosome RNA and Protein Isolation
Kit (Invitrogen, USA), following the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically
(Thermo Scientific, USA), and its quality was assessed
by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
USA).
Microarray hybridization and analysis were per­
formed as previously described [11, 13], using Affy­metrix
GeneChip miRNA 4.0 Array, which contains 2578 human
mature miRNA probe sets. The data output was received
in Excel spreadsheets containing the normalized miRNA
expression profiles. Differentially expressed miRNAs
were filtered to exclude those changes less than 2.0-fold
compared with MDA-MB-231/S or Exosomes/S.

Cell proliferation inhibition assay
Cell proliferation was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethy­
lthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT;
Sigma) assay as previously described [11]. Briefly, MDAMB-231 cells were plated at a density of 8×104 cells
mL−1 and dispensed into 96-well culture plate with 100μL
of DMEM medium per well. After 24h, 100μL serial
concentrations of the drugs were added to cultured cells
(quadruplicate wells per condition). The cells were then
cultured for 48h prior to the addition of 20μL of a 5 mg/
mL solution of MTT into each well. The incubation was
continued for 4h before the media was removed. 150μL
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; AMRESCO, America) was

Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)

Prediction of target genes

Expression of miRNA was analyzed using MiR-X
miRNA qRT-PCR SYBR Kit (638314; Clontech
Laboratories, USA) on Roche LightCycler 480 II. U6
snRNA was used as endogenous control to normalize
miRNA expression in cells and tissues. The primers for
U6 were 5’- CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3’ and 5’- AA
CGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3’. MiR-16 was used as
endogenous control to normalize miRNA expression in
exosomes. The forward primers of miR-X corresponds
to the miR-X sequence but with the substitution of
uridine for thymidine. The Ct values for each gene were
normalized to endogenous control, and the relative fold
change values were calculated using the ΔΔCt method.
Every run experiment was performed along with negative
controls (nuclease-free water or the extracted RNA
without RT as a template). PCR specificity was judged
based on the presence of a single product at the end of
the 40 cycles based on melting curve analyses showing
a single peak at the product melting temperature, as well
as based on examination of the products after 2% agarose
gel electrophoresis. All the samples were analyzed in
duplicates for each specific gene.

The target genes of the specific selected dysre­
gulated miRNAs were predicted by in silico analysis using
TargetScan [15] (Release 7.0, http://www.targetscan.org)
and miRDB [16] (Version 5.0, http://www.mirdb.org).
Given that the prediction programs often suffer from high
false positive rates, only the target genes predicted by both
programs were considered further.

KEGG pathway analysis of target genes
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
pathway enrichment analysis was performed to compare
the specific miRNAs targets with the whole reference gene
background using Database for Annotation, Visualization
and Integrated Discovery [17] (DAVID, Version 6.7, http://
david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). The count number lager than 2 and
P-value less than 0.05 were chosen as cut-off criterion.
Cytoscape 3.1.1 was utilized to construct the possible
functional network of the selected miRNAs [18].

Data analysis
Statistical significance of miRNA expression bet­ween
preneoadjuvant chemotherapy biopsies and paired surgicallyresected specimens was assessed using Wilcoxon matched
pairs signed rank test. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum
test was used to evaluate expression differences of miRNAs
between different groups of cell lines or patients. Statistical
significance was assumed when P < 0.05. Statistical analysis
was performed using R software, version 3.1.1.

Patients and samples
We retrospectively identified 23 patients who
underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by
surgery for primary breast cancer at Nanjing Drum Tower
Hospital between January 2010 and February 2015.
The preneoadjuvant chemotherapy biopsies and paired
surgically-resected specimens of these patients, routinely
fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin, were
obtained from the Department of Pathology. Medical
records were reviewed to obtain information about patient,
tumor, and treatment characteristics. Tumor response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated based on the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
guidelines [14]. The study protocol was approved by the
ethics committee of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, and
informed consent was obtained from all patients.
