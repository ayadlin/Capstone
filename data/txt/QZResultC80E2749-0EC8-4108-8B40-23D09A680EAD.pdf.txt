Oncogenic signaling by Kit tyrosine kinase occurs selectively
on the Golgi apparatus in gastrointestinal stromal tumors

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are caused by gain-of-function mutations in the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase. Most primary GIST
patients respond to the Kit inhibitor imatinib, but this drug often becomes ineffective because of secondary mutations in the Kit kinase
domain. The characteristic intracellular accumulation of imatinib-sensitive and -resistant Kit protein is well documented, but its
relationship to oncogenic signaling remains unknown. Here, we show that in cancer tissue from primary GIST patients as well as in cell
lines, mutant Kit accumulates on the Golgi apparatus, whereas normal Kit localizes to the plasma membrane (PM). In imatinib-resistant
GIST with a secondary Kit mutation, Kit localizes predominantly on the Golgi apparatus. Both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant
Kit (Kit(mut)) become fully auto-phosphorylated only on the Golgi and only if in a complex-glycosylated form. Kit(mut) accumulates on
the Golgi during the early secretory pathway, but not after endocytosis. The aberrant kinase activity of Kit(mut) prevents its export from
the Golgi to the PM. Furthermore, Kit(mut) on the Golgi signals and activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–Akt (PI3K–Akt) pathway,
signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), and the Mek–Erk pathway. Blocking the biosynthetic transport of Kit(mut) to
the Golgi from the endoplasmic reticulum inhibits oncogenic signaling. PM localization of Kit(mut) is not required for its signaling.
Activation of Src-family tyrosine kinases on the Golgi is essential for oncogenic Kit signaling. These results suggest that the Golgi
apparatus serves as a platform for oncogenic Kit signaling. Our study demonstrates that Kit(mut)’s pathogenicity is related to its mislocalization, and may offer a new strategy for treating imatinib-resistant GISTs.

INTRODUCTION
Kit, a cell-surface receptor for stem cell factor, belongs to the type
III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family that includes plateletderived growth factor receptor α/β (PDGFRα/β), Flt3 and Fms.1–3
Kit is expressed on interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), mast cells,
hematopoietic cells, germ cells and melanocytes.4–6
Kit is composed of the amino-terminal extracellular portion that
binds stem cell factor, a transmembrane domain, and the carboxyterminal intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.4,7 The binding of
stem cell factor autophosphorylates Kit on speciﬁc tyrosine
residues, for example, Tyr568, Tyr570, Tyr703 and Tyr721.4,8,9 Kit
then binds to other cytoplasmic proteins, and this complex
phosphorylates other proteins.3,4,8 This activates the PI3K–Akt
pathway, the Ras–Mek–Erk cascade and Src kinases, which
regulate gene expression and cytoskeletal structures, resulting in
cell proliferation and survival.7–10
In many gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) (~85%) and
mastocytomas, Kit has gain-of-function mutations, causing ligandindependent auto-activation of the receptor11–14 (Supplementary
Figure S1a). Mutant Kit (Kit(mut)) transforms a precursor of ICC
through permanent activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway, STATs
and Erk resulting in development of GIST.15–21 GIST cells can then
proliferate autonomously due to the anti-apoptotic effect and cell
cycle progression by Kit signals.17–21 PDGFRα(mut) also causes
GIST (~5%) in this way.22,23 Ten percent of GISTs have no mutation
either in Kit or PDGFRα.23,24

The drug imatinib, a selective inhibitor of Kit, improved the
prognosis of GIST patients and the median overall survival is now
estimated more than 5 years.23–25 However, resistance to the drug
appears with prolonged use and has become a serious
problem.23,24 Most imatinib-resistant cases have a secondary Kit
mutation in the kinase domain, and then lose sensitivity to the
drug.24,26,27 Further understanding of oncogenic signals is
required for establishment of effective targeting of therapy.
The characteristic intracellular accumulation of Kit(mut) and
PDGFRα(mut) in GIST patients is well documented,28–33 but its
relationship to oncogenic signaling remains unknown. We
recently reported that in mastocytomas, Kit(mut) causes oncogenic signaling on intracellular compartments, such as endo/
lysosomes.34 We then explored how and where oncogenic Kit
signals occur in GISTs. Here we show that in primary GIST patients
and cell lines, mutant Kit accumulates on the Golgi apparatus in a
manner that depends on its kinase activity. In imatinib-resistant
GIST with a secondary Kit mutation, Kit localizes predominantly on
the Golgi. Both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant Kit (Kit
(mut)) become fully auto-phosphorylated only on the Golgi and
only if in a complex-glycosylated form. Furthermore, Kit(mut) on
the Golgi signals and activates the PI3K–Akt pathway, STAT5, and
the Mek–Erk pathway. Blocking Kit’s localization to the Golgi from
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) inhibits oncogenic signaling.
Plasma membrane (PM) localization of Kit(mut) is not required
for its signaling. Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) on the Golgi are

essential for oncogenic Kit signaling. Our study demonstrates that
Kit(mut)’s pathogenicity is related to its mis-localization, and may
offer a new strategy for treating imatinib-resistant GISTs.

RESULTS
In cancer tissue from GIST patients, Kit(mut) accumulates on the
Golgi apparatus
To investigate the sub-cellular localization of Kit, we performed
confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopic analyses of cancer
tissue from GIST patients. In GIST expressing Kit(mut), Kit

accumulated at the perinuclear region (Figure 1a). In contrast, in
GIST with no Kit mutations or PDGFRα mutations, wild-type (wt) Kit
localized preferentially at the PM (Figure 1b). Moreover, PDGFRα
(mut) localized to the perinuclear region instead of the PM
(Figure 1c), indicating that in GIST, type III RTKs with mutations
mis-localize. Since the perinuclear region may connect to the
Golgi apparatus,28–33,35 we also stained with a Golgi marker
GM130 to see if Kit and PDGFRα were located there. Kit(mut) and
PDGFRα(mut), but not Kit(wt), co-localized precisely with GM130
(Figures 1d–f). By calculating Pearson’s R correlation coefﬁcients
(Pearson’s R) between GM130 and the receptors, we found that Kit
(mut) and PDGFRα(mut) localized signiﬁcantly on the Golgi,

whereas Kit(wt) did not (Figure 1g and Table 1). Furthermore, in
imatinib-resistant GISTs with a secondary Kit mutation, Kit also
localized at the Golgi (Figure 1g, Supplementary Figure S1b, and
Table 1). Taken together, these results suggest that the oncogenic
signaling may occur on the Golgi apparatus.
In GIST cell lines, Kit(mut) localizes preferentially on the Golgi
apparatus
Next, to examine more broadly the sub-cellular localization of Kit,
we stained GIST-T1, GIST882 and GIST-R8 cell lines, which
endogenously express Kit(mut). GIST-T1 heterozygously expresses
a Kit exon11 mutant Kit(Δ560–578), whereas GIST882 homozygously expresses Kit(K642E) (Supplementary Figure S2a).20,36 GISTR8 was established from GIST-T1 by continuous imatinib
treatment, and this endogenously expresses Kit(Δ560–578/
D820V) that confers imatinib resistance37 (Supplementary
Figure S2a, bottom). In these cell lines, Kit localized mainly to
the perinuclear region but not the PM (Figures 2a–c, arrowheads).
A green ﬂuorescent protein-tagged Kit(wt) (Kit(wt)-GFP) was seen
predominantly at the PM in HeLa and GIST-T1 (Supplementary
Figure S2b), indicating that Kit(mut) distributes speciﬁcally to the
perinuclear region in GIST cell lines. These results are consistent
with those from tumor tissue (Figure 1 and Supplementary
Figure S1b).28–30
Next, we stained for Kit in conjunction with golgin97 (transGolgi marker), GM130 (cis-Golgi marker), calnexin (ER marker),
LAMP1 (endo/lysosome marker) or LysoTracker (lysosome marker).
In GIST cells, Kit co-localized mainly with the Golgi markers
(Figure 2d and Supplementary Figures S2c–e). Furthermore, Kit
(mut) more precisely localized to the trans-Golgi rather than to the
cis-Golgi (Figure 2e), indicating that in GIST, Kit(mut) accumulates
on the trans-Golgi cisternae.
In GIST cells, activation of Kit(mut) occurs mainly on the Golgi
apparatus
To examine the relationship between Golgi localization of Kit(mut)
and its activity, we immuno-stained for phospho-tyrosine-721 in
the kinase domain (pKit[Tyr721]) that indicates Kit’s activation.7–9
Interestingly, pKit[Tyr721] was found only in the perinuclear
region in GIST-T1, GIST882 and GIST-R8 (Figure 3a, arrowheads).
Furthermore, pKit[Tyr721] distributed signiﬁcantly to the Golgi
rather than other perinuclear compartments, such as lysosomes
(Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S3a). Figure 3c shows
that pKit[Tyr721] co-localized with golgin97 (trans-Golgi marker)
rather than with GM130 (cis-Golgi marker), indicating that
more activation occurs on trans-Golgi than on cis-Golgi. Also,
tyrosine phosphorylation signals are concentrated in the
Golgi (Supplementary Figures S3b and c), indicating that Golgi
apparatus serves as a platform for tyrosine phosphorylation
signaling in GISTs. In GIST-T1 and HeLa cells transfected with a
mastocytoma-type mutant Kit(D814Y),14,34,38 autophosphorylation
of the mutant mainly occurs on the Golgi (Supplementary
Figure S3d). This indicates that in these cells, gain-of-function
mutations of Kit cause its activation selectively on the Golgi
apparatus.
To test Kit’s glycosylation state, we treated Kit from GIST cells
with endoglycosidase H, which digests immature high-mannose
forms, but not mature complex-glycosylated forms. Most Kit was
in a complex-glycosylated form (Figure 3d and Supplementary
Figure S3e). Kit shifted to a non-glycosylated form following the
complete digestion of N-linked glycans by peptide-N-glycosidase
F. Moreover, autophosphorylation of mature Kit was greater than
that of immature Kit (Figure 3e and Supplementary Figure S3f).
Since mature glycosylated proteins only exist on the trans-Golgi,
these results suggest that full activation of Kit(mut) occurs on the
trans-Golgi, and that Kit must be in the complex-glycosylated form
to become fully activated.

Kit(mut) accumulates on the Golgi during the early secretory
pathway but not after endocytosis in a manner that depends on
its kinase activity
Next, we examined whether Kit accumulated on the Golgi after
the early secretory pathway or after endocytosis from the PM.
Recently, we reported that endocytosis of Kit(mut) can be blocked
by pitstop2 and ﬁlipin, which inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and non-clathrin endocytosis, respectively.34,39,40 In GIST-T1,
endocytosis inhibition for 24 h did not affect either the Golgi
localization of Kit or its phosphorylation (Figure 4a), indicating that
the major pathway is early secretion. In support of this, Kit’s
activation on the Golgi was unaffected by 24-h treatment with
monensin, an inhibitor of Golgi export34,41 (Supplementary
Figure S4; see also Figure 5b, left panels). These results indicate
that Kit(mut) accumulated on the Golgi during the early secretory
pathway, but not after endocytosis.
We next examined the role of Kit’s activation in Kit’s localization.
To test this, we treated a selective Kit inhibitor imatinib25,42
(Supplementary Figure S5a). In GIST-T1 treated with 200 nM
imatinib for 4 h, Kit dispersed from the Golgi region signiﬁcantly
(Figure 4b). Immunostaining of cell surface showed that Kit moved
to the PM (Figure 4c). Imatinib, however, did not affect the
localization of Kit in GIST-R8, (Supplementary Figures S5b and c).
To block the activation of Kit(mut) in GIST-R8, we treated with
another Kit inhibitor PKC41234,43,45 (Supplementary Figure S5b). In
GIST-R8, PKC412 signiﬁcantly decreased the Golgi localization of
Kit (Supplementary Figure S5c). Taken together, these results
suggest that what prevents Kit’s export from the Golgi is Kit’s
kinase activity.
In GIST, Kit(mut) on the Golgi activates the PI3K–Akt pathway,
STAT5 and Erk
Previous reports showed that Kit(mut) activates the PI3K–Akt
pathway, STAT5 and the Mek–Erk pathway through
phosphorylation15–21 (Supplementary Figures S6a–c), leading to
autonomous proliferation of GIST cells. Thus, we examined
whether Kit(mut) must localize to the Golgi to activate the PI3K–
Akt pathway, STAT5 and Erk. To answer this we inhibited
intracellular trafﬁcking. First, we treated GIST-T1 with brefeldin A
(BFA), an inhibitor of protein trafﬁcking from the ER to the
Golgi.34,46 After 16-h treatment, partially glycosylated Kit colocalized with the ER marker calnexin, a sign of inhibition of
trafﬁcking to the Golgi (Figure 5a). Interestingly, pKit[Tyr721] was
greatly reduced in BFA-treated GIST-T1, thus Kit could not activate
the PI3K–Akt pathway, STAT5, or Erk (Figure 5a, right panels; see
also Figure 5e, left panels).

Furthermore, we treated for 24 h with monensin, an inhibitor of

phosphorylated and activated downstream molecules, but shifted
to a slightly lower molecular weight form (Figure 5b, right; see also
Supplementary Figure S4). This form was endoglycosidase
H-resistant (Supplementary Figure S6d), indicating that most Kit
reached the trans-Golgi cisternae. Since monensin inhibits Kit

localization of Kit is not required for oncogenic signaling, and
Golgi-localization is sufﬁcient.
We previously reported that baﬁlomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor
of endo/lysosomal trafﬁcking, suppresses Akt activation by Kit
(mut) in mastocytoma.34 Thus, we examined the effect of
inhibition of endo/lysosomal trafﬁcking on oncogenic Kit signaling
in GISTs. As shown in Figure 5c, BafA1 increased Kit on vesicular
structures, suggesting that some Kit trafﬁcs along the endo/

lysosomal pathway for degradation. Inhibition of endo/lysosomal
trafﬁcking, however, does not affect oncogenic Kit signaling
(Figure 5c and Supplementary Figure S6e). These results are
different from how Kit(mut) in mastocytoma activates Akt
and STAT5.
Data from GIST882 and GIST-R8 treated with BFA or monensin
strongly supported our idea that in GISTs, oncogenic Kit signals
originate from the Golgi (Figure 5d and Supplementary
Figure S6f). In GIST882 and GIST-R8, but not GIST-T1, Kit(mut) in
the ER became Tyr721 phosphorylated (Figure 5d and
Supplementary Figure S6f). Since phosphorylated KitTyr721 is
critical for association with a PI3K p85 subunit,4,8,9 we tested
whether Kit bound to p85 in the ER. Co-immunoprecipitation
experiments, following BFA treatment to block ER export, showed
that in GIST882 and GIST-R8, Kit still associated with p85, but in
GIST-T1 it did not (Figure 5e and Supplementary Figure S6g). In all
cases, downstream signaling was abolished. These results indicate
that Kit(mut) in the ER is unable to activate Akt, even if Kit(mut)
binds to PI3K. In these cell lines, monensin did not affect the Kit–
PI3K association (Figure 5e and Supplementary Figure S6g),
supporting our ﬁnding that Kit(mut) activates Akt signaling
through PI3K on the Golgi apparatus.
Supplementary Figure S6h shows that in GIST882’s Golgi, Kit
was phosphorylated not only on Tyr721 but also on Tyr568/570
and Tyr703.4,8,47 In the ER, Kit was dephosphorylated on Tyr568/570 and Tyr703 markedly, although Tyr721 was dephosphorylated partially (Supplementary Figure S6i; compare with
Figure 5d). This conﬁrms that full activation of Kit(mut) occurs
only after it reaches the Golgi apparatus. In addition, these results
suggest that different tyrosines get phosphorylated in different
organelles.
Swainsonine inhibits α-mannosidase II at the medial-Golgi,
altering protein glycosylation.48 In swainsonine-treated cells, Kit
was shifted to a slightly lower molecular weight, conﬁrming
altered glycosylation (Supplementary Figure S7a, top panels). The
treatment did not however affect Kit’s localization and the
activation of Akt, STAT5 and Erk (Supplementary Figures S7a
and b). These results indicate that oncogenic Kit signaling on the
Golgi is independent of glycosylation state.
Activation of Src-family tyrosine kinases on the Golgi is essential
for oncogenic Kit signaling
Previous studies showed that SFKs, such as Src, Yes, Lyn and Fyn
localize to the Golgi through lipid modiﬁcation, where they can
initiate mitogenic signals.49,50 Thus, we examined whether SFKs
were involved in oncogenic Kit signaling. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S8a, GIST-T1, GIST882 and GIST-R8
expressed Src and Yes. Although Src and Yes were undetectable
by our immunoﬂuorescence assay, anti-SFKs and antiphosphorylated SFKs (anti-pSFKs) could visualize their intracellular
location. SFKs predominantly localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae
(Figures 6a and b and Supplementary Figure S8b). In addition,
pSFKs localized to the trans-Golgi cisternae, where Kit(mut)
accumulated (Figures 6c and d, and Supplementary Figure S8b),
indicating that SFKs on the Golgi might participate in oncogenic
Kit signaling.
Next, we investigated the effect of the inhibition of SFKs on Kit
signaling. We conﬁrmed that PP2 inhibited the autophosphorylation of Src and Yes (Figure 6e and Supplementary Figure S8c). SFK
inhibition decreased the activation of Akt, STAT5 and Erk without
affecting pKit[Tyr721] or pKit[Tyr703] (Figures 6f and g, and
Supplementary Figure S8d). As shown in Figure 6h, the inhibition
of SFKs decreased pKit[Tyr568/570]. In addition to PP2, the
unrelated SFK inhibitor SU665650 gave similar results (Supplementary Figure S8e and f). Our co-immunoprecipitation assays,
however, showed that Src and Yes did not bind Kit(mut) (Figure 6i
and Supplementary Figure S8g). These results suggest that SFKs
Oncogene (2017) 3661 – 3672

have a role in the full functioning of Kit(mut) without any direct
physical interaction. Also, BFA (a Golgi disruptor) and imatinib
(a Kit inhibitor) did not affect the activation of SFKs (Figures 6e
and j, and Supplementary Figures S8c and h), indicating that the
activation of SFKs is independent of Kit(mut). In summary, Kit(mut)
requires Golgi-localized SFK activity for oncogenic signaling
(Supplementary Figure S8i). These results are consistent with our
hypothesis that in GIST, the Golgi apparatus serves as a platform
for oncogenic signaling.
Previous reports showed that SFKs regulate intra-Golgi
transport.50 Thus, we tested whether SFKs have a role in retention
of Kit(mut) on the Golgi. As shown in Supplementary Figure S9a,
SFK inhibition did not affect the localization of Kit to the Golgi.
Taken together with fact that SFK inhibition suppressed the PI3K–
Akt pathway, STAT5 and Erk, it appears that these activations are
not essential for Kit’s retention on the Golgi. In support of this,
LY294002 (PI3K inhibition), Akt inhibitor and U0126 (Erk inhibition)
had no effect on the localization of Kit to the Golgi
(Supplementary Figures S9a and b). At present, the mechanism
of Kit’s retention on the Golgi is not understood fully.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that in GIST, Kit(mut) accumulates
on the Golgi and that oncogenic Kit signaling occurs on the Golgi
(Figure 7, left). Newly synthesized Kit(mut) trafﬁcs normally from
the ER to the Golgi, then undergoes complex glycosylation as
normal. After reacting the Golgi, Kit(mut) can activate the PI3K–Akt
pathway, STAT5 and the Mek–Erk pathway. Activation of SFKs on
the Golgi is needed for oncogenic Kit signaling. Activation of Kit in
the wrong subcellular compartment then prevents its export from
Golgi to the PM. These mechanisms are common between
imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant Kit(mut).
Aberrant accumulation of oncogenic receptors in the Golgi has
been reported previously. FGFR3(K650E), a mutant found in
multiple myelomas and skeletal dysplasia patients, is localized
on the Golgi, then autophosphorylated,51,52 and PDGFRα(mut) and
Kit(mut) expressed in HEK293 or NIH3T3 localize to the Golgi
region.29,35,53 H-Ras and SFKs, which are downstream molecules of
RTKs, can initiate mitogenic signaling from the Golgi
apparatus.49,50,54,55 However, there has been no direct evidence
that the mutant receptors cause oncogenic signaling on the Golgi
apparatus. Here, we show that mutant receptors mis-localize in
solid tumor using a panel of cancer tissues from GIST patients, and
that Kit(mut) must localize to the Golgi to cause oncogenic
activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway, STAT5 and Erk. Our study
demonstrates in GISTs the pathological signiﬁcance of the
accumulation of mutant receptors in the Golgi for their signaling.
Recently, we reported that in mast cells, Kit(D814Y) activates the
PI3K–Akt pathway and STAT5 on endo/lysosomes and the ER,
respectively34 (Figure 7, right). In this study, Kit(D814Y) expressed
in GIST cells, however, was autophosphorylated only on the Golgi
apparatus. Namely, GIST and mastocytoma both show the same
oncogenic Kit(mut) signaling mechanism, but the signaling
platforms are different. These results are consistent with the idea
that there may be different regulatory mechanisms of oncogenic
signaling initiated from organelles where Kit is localized.
In considering putative mechanisms, in GIST, Kit(mut) accumulated on the Golgi in a manner dependent only on its kinase
activity, and independent of downstream activation. Inhibitors of
downstream activation, such as Ly294002 and U0126, do not
block Kit’s phosphorylation and association with other proteins,
suggesting that feature of the phosphorylated Kit(mut) complex,
such as shape, size, and/or charge, is responsible for its retention
in the Golgi apparatus. On the other hand, in mastocytoma, Kit
(mut) can move from the Golgi normally.34 Further analyses of
differences of trafﬁcking machinery between mastocytoma and
GIST may explain the Golgi retention of Kit(mut).

Mutations in Kit’s juxta-membrane domain or tyrosine kinase
domain 1 (TKD1) are common in GISTs,11,23,24 but rare in human
neoplastic mast cell disorders.14 Neoplastic mast cells commonly
have a mutation elsewhere, in the activation loop of Kit’s tyrosine
kinase domain 2 (TKD2).14 GIST-type Kit may be insufﬁcient for
transforming mast cells. A previous study on Ba/F3 cells showed
that the TKD1 mutant but not the juxta-membrane domain
mutant can suppresses the expression of SH2-containing inositol5'-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1)56 that inhibits the PI3K–Akt pathway,57
suggesting that different Kit mutants use different signaling
pathways. The TKD2 mutant may have novel functions, which
GIST-type Kit does not have. TKD2 mutant may lead mast cells to
autonomous proliferation, not only through SHIP1 suppression,
but also through other signal pathways different to those seen in
GIST. Forced expression of each mutant in mast cells and analyses
of signaling will help us to understand the precise mechanism.
Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), which is
necessary for Akt activation, is believed to be generated only at
the PM by Kit–PI3K.3,4,9 This seems to be inconsistent with our
observation that Kit activates Akt through PI3K on the Golgi.
However, previous studies showed that PI(4,5)P2, a substrate of
PI3K, exists on the Golgi,58–60 supporting our hypothesis that
Golgi-localized Kit–PI3K can activate Akt. On the other hand, in the
ER, PI(4,5)P2 is converted mainly to PI(4)P,59 so ER-localized Kit–
PI3K cannot activate Akt. Further studies will be required to
understand the mechanism by which the Kit–PI3K complex
activates Akt selectively on the Golgi apparatus.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and antibodies have been
widely used for blocking signaling from RTKs.61,62 Our study
implicates that mutant RTKs, such as Kit(mut) and PDGFRα(mut),
can escape from antibodies because the mutants are trapped
inside cells. Since treatment with TKIs causes mutant RTKs to
remain at the PM through inhibiting mislocalization of the
mutants,29,34,35,63,64 TKIs might also enhance the activity of
antibody in blocking oncogenic signaling. From this point of
view, combined therapy with TKIs and antibody seems attractive.
Imatinib is efﬁcacious in most patients with primary GISTs
harboring Kit mutations.23–25 However, two major problems arise
in this targeting therapy. First, resistance to the drug appears with
prolonged use. Most imatinib-resistant cases have a secondary Kit
mutation in the kinase domain, and then lose sensitivity to the
drug.23,26,27 In other cancers with RTK(mut), resistance to TKIs
develops in a manner similar to imatinib-resistant Kit.65 In this
study, we showed that blockade of Kit trafﬁcking from the ER
suppresses its oncogenic signaling. Importantly, its blockade could
suppress oncogenic Kit signaling regardless of resistance to TKI
drugs. These results suggest that blockade of trafﬁcking may be a
new strategy for inhibition of TKI-resistant RTKs. A second concern
with imatinib treatment is its side effects. A previous study
reported that patients with a duplication in the Kit extracellular
domain require a higher dosage of imatinib.13,66 However, side
effects such as nausea and anemia limit dosage. Recent studies
showed that imatinib accumulates mainly in lysosomes but not in
the Golgi.67,68 Golgi-targeting of imatinib by chemical modiﬁcations might improve therapeutic efﬁcacy and reduce side effects.
Since the cancer-causing mutants of EGF-R, Met, Flt3 and gp130
also initiate their signals from organelles,64,69–73 intracellular
delivery of TKIs to signaling platforms will open new ﬁelds for
targeting therapy.
In conclusion, we show that oncogenic Kit signals from the
Golgi are essential for the autonomous proliferation of GIST cells.
These ﬁndings provide new insights not only into the pathogenic
role of Kit(mut) but also into targeting therapy. Improper
trafﬁcking and aberrant signaling are frequent features of mutant
RTKs. Our ﬁndings shed light on the signiﬁcance of the spatial
organization of this oncogenic signaling, and suggest strategies
for the improvement of therapy.

Figure 7. Model of oncogenic Kit signaling on intracellular
compartments in GISTs and mast cell tumors. (Left, GISTs) Newly
synthesized Kit(mut) trafﬁcs normally from the ER to the Golgi, then
undergoes complex glycosylation as normal. After reacting the
Golgi, Kit(mut) can activate the PI3K–Akt pathway, STAT5 and Erk.
SFKs on the Golgi are needed for oncogenic Kit signaling. Activation
of Kit in the wrong subcellular compartment, then prevents its
export from Golgi to the PM. These mechanisms are common
between imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant Kit cases. (Right,
mast cell tumors) Soon after synthesis, immature Kit is localized
on the ER and activates STAT5. It then trafﬁcs to the PM along
the secretory pathway. After Kit(mut) reaches the PM, it immediately moves to endolysosomes through endocytosis in a kinase
activity-dependent manner. Kit–PI3K activates Akt speciﬁcally on
endolysosomes.
