ABSTRACT
Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical cancer and a large fraction of head
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Cidofovir (CDV) proved efficacious in
the treatment of several HPV-induced benign and malignant hyper proliferations. To
provide a better insight into how CDV selectively eradicates transformed cells, HPV+
and HPV− cervical carcinoma and HNSCC cell lines were compared to normal cells for
antiproliferative effects, CDV metabolism, drug incorporation into cellular DNA, and
DNA damage. Incorporation of CDV into cellular DNA was higher in tumor cells than in
normal cells and correlated with CDV antiproliferative effects, which were independent
of HPV status. Increase in phospho-ATM levels was detected following CDV exposure
and higher levels of γ-H2AX (a quantitative marker of double-strand breaks) were
measured in tumor cells compared to normal cells. A correlation between DNA damage
and CDV incorporation into DNA was found but not between DNA damage and CDV
antiproliferative effects. These data indicate that CDV antiproliferative effects result
from incorporation of the drug into DNA causing DNA damage. However, the antitumor effects of CDV cannot be exclusively ascribed to DNA damage. Furthermore,
CDV can be considered a promising broad spectrum anti-cancer agent, not restricted
to HPV+ lesions.

INTRODUCTION

retinoblastoma family of proteins (pRB), abrogating DNA
repair and maintenance of genomic integrity. In contrast
to normal cells, tumor cells are often unable to repair
DNA damage because of defects in their DNA damage
response mechanisms [7]. Upon double-strand breaks
(DSBs), the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein
is activated by phosphorylation of a serine at position
1981 which causes monomerization and transport of ATM
to the sites of DNA damage. The stabilization of ATM at
DNA damage sites is required for a proper DNA damage
response [8]. Phospho-ATM can be dephosphorylated
by protein phosphatase 2 (PPA2) and by wild-type p53induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1). These phosphatases
prevent illicit activation of the DNA damage response in
the absence of damage and allow rapid cessation of the
signal once DNA damage is repaired [9]. Activated ATM
is responsible for the phosphorylation of the H2A histone
family member X (H2AX) protein at serine 139 resulting
in γ-H2AX (phosphorylated-H2AX) foci at the sites of
DNA damage. Phosphorylation of H2AX was shown to be
important to recruit repair proteins to DNA damage sites

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are doublestranded DNA viruses with a small genome of about 8 kbp.
HPVs can induce benign (low-risk types) and malignant
(high-risk types) lesions. High-risk HPVs are involved in
almost all cases of cervical carcinoma, a number of other
anogenital cancers and an increasing amount of head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) [1–3].
HPVs have a tropism for epithelial cells and cancer
progression is associated with a persistent infection caused
by a high-risk HPV type (such as HPV type 16, 18, 31,
33 and 45). When an HPV infection evolves into cancer,
the episomal viral DNA frequently becomes integrated
into the host-cell DNA resulting in a loss of viral gene
expression, except for the genes encoding the HPV E6
and E7 oncoproteins [4]. These two oncoproteins are
responsible for cell transformation and immortalization
[5]. Among several functions, E6 causes degradation
of the tumor suppressor p53 [6] while one of the most
important functions of E7 is the association with the

and γ-H2AX is considered a sensitive and quantitative
indicator of DSBs [10].
Although there are effective prophylactic vaccines
available for HPV, treatment of HPV infections remains a
challenge [11]. HPV vaccination is not applied worldwide
and generally only adolescent women are vaccinated,
leaving men, relatively older women and non-vaccinated
populations unprotected [12]. Current treatment of early
stage cervical cancer consists of surgical removal of the
cervical cone (conization). Hysterectomy with radio- and/
or chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for women
with invasive cervical cancer [13]. HNSCC patients are
currently treated by either surgery or a combination of
chemo- and radiotherapy [14]. These interventions are
generally effective although a substantial morbidity and
disease recurrence are described [15, 16].
Cidofovir
[(CDV),
[(S)-1-[3-hydroxy-2(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]cytosine], HPMPC, Vistide®]
is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (ANP) known for
its broad-spectrum antiviral activity against DNA viruses.
CDV was approved by the FDA for the treatment of
cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients [17].
CDV also proved to be efficacious in patients suffering
from HPV-associated diseases including severe laryngeal
papillomatosis, anogenital papillomavirus infections and
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stages 2+ and 3 [18–22].
CDV was shown to have antiproliferative properties
against HPV+ cervical carcinoma and HPV- transformed
cell lines [23]. Moreover, CDV has not only been
demonstrated to improve the pathology caused by the
growth of HPV+ xenografts in athymic nude mice [24],
but also against a number of HPV- malignancies in vivo
like glioblastoma, hemangiosarcoma and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma [25–28].
CDV requires two phosphorylation steps in order
to be active. The first phosphorylation is catalyzed
by the cytosolic UMP-CMP kinase, producing CDVmonophosphate (CDVp) which is then phosphorylated
by a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase
or creatine kinase to the diphosphate form (CDVpp).
The intracellular depot form of CDV, cidofovir
monophosphocholine (CDVp-choline) is formed by
choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase [29–31]. CDVpp
is the active metabolite and can be incorporated into DNA
instead of the natural substrate dCTP [17].
The antiproliferative effects of CDV against HPV+
cervical cancer cell lines were reported for the first time
in 1998 [23]. In contrast to other chemotherapeutic
agents, inhibition of cell growth by CDV increased in
function of time [23]. Today, the molecular mechanisms
underlying the selectivity of CDV for transformed cells
are not completely understood. To investigate the selective
effects of CDV for tumor cells compared to normal cells,
our group performed a comprehensive analysis of gene
expression profiling by means of microarray in cervical
cancer cells [SiHa (HPV16+) and HeLa (HPV18+)],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) and primary human
keratinocytes (PHKs), exposed or not to CDV. Functional
classification of differentially expressed genes, using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, was performed to
identify functional categories and molecular pathways
changed following CDV exposure in transformed cells
versus normal cells. Cell cycle regulation and DSB repair
mechanisms, such as ATM signaling and DSB repair by
homologous recombination were found to be activated in
CDV-exposed PHKs but not in transformed cells. These
data pointed to the generation of DSBs following CDV
exposure [32]. Furthermore, previous results revealed
that CDV selectivity for HPV transformed cells may be
based on differences in replication rates and on CDV
incorporation into genomic DNA between cancer cells
(SiHa, HeLa and HaCaT) and normal cells (PHKs) [32].
Here we have demonstrated at the protein level that
CDV induces DSBs in different tumor cell types.
Induction of DNA damage by CDV was compared with
antiproliferative effects and drug incorporation into
DNA in our studies using both high-risk HPV+ and HPV−
HNSCC and cervical carcinoma cell lines as well as
normal cells. We demonstrate here a correlation between
DNA incorporation of CDV and DNA damage and
between CDV incorporation and antiproliferative effects
but not between DNA damage and CDV antiproliferative
effects. Our findings also support the applicability of CDV
as a broad spectrum antitumor agent against both HPV+
and HPV− tumors.

RESULTS
Antiproliferative effects of CDV on HPV+ and
HPV− tumor cells and normal cells
The antiproliferative effects of CDV were evaluated
in HPV+ and HPV− transformed cells as well as normal
cells. Before performing these experiments, the HPV
positivity and negativity of all cell lines was confirmed by
means of PCR with specific primers for the detection of
HPV16, HPV18 and HPV33. All cells were tested for the
three HPV types and the HPV16 positivity of SiHa, Caski,
SCC-147, UM-SCC-47, UD-SCC-2 and UM-SCC-104
was confirmed. HeLa cells proved to be HPV18+ and
CK1 and UT-SCC-45 were HPV33+. The other cell lines
(i.e. C33A, SCC-9, SCC-4, SCC-120, UM-SCC-38 and
HaCaT) and the normal human diploid cells (i.e. HEL,
PHK and PET) were negative for HPV16, HPV18 or
HPV33.
The antiproliferative effects of CDV on the different
cells were measured at 3, 5, 7 and 10 days post-exposure
to CDV (Figure 1A). First, the CC50 values at 3 days
post-treatment were compared for the different cell lines
(Figure 1B). Lower CC50 values at 3 days post-treatment
were observed for most of the transformed cell lines in

comparison with normal cells, showing the selectivity of
CDV for tumor cells. SiHa, CK1, HaCaT and SCC-120
were significantly more sensitive to CDV after 3 days of
treatment than PHK, HEL and PET cells. Also HeLa cells,
SCC-147, UT-SCC-45, SCC-4, SCC-9 and C33A showed
lower CC50 values than PET and HEL cells, but they were
not significantly different from PHKs. UD-SCC-2, UMSCC-47 and Caski showed a difference in CC50’s with
PET cells 3 days post-treatment but not with the two
other normal cells. UM-SCC-104 and UM-SCC-38 had
a sensitivity to CDV comparable to that of normal cells.
Our results showed that the antiproliferative activity
of CDV significantly increased over time from day 3 to
day 10 post-treatment in all the cell lines tested, except for
Caski and SCC-120, where the increase was not significant
(Figure 1A).
After 7 days of treatment, CDV inhibited the growth
of most of the cancer cell lines (SiHa, CK1, SCC-147,
UM-SCC-47, UT-SCC-45, UM-SCC-104, UM-SCC-38,
C33A, HaCaT, SCC-120, SCC-4, SCC-9) in comparison
with HEL and PET cells (Figure 1B). However, no
significant differences in CC50 values between these tumor
cell lines and PHKs were observed. The proliferation of
HeLa and UD-SCC-2 cells was significantly reduced by
CDV at 7 days post-treatment compared to PET cells, but
not compared to PHKs and HEL cells. The CC50 values of
Caski were not different from those of normal cells at 7
days post-treatment.
The doubling time (DT) of the different cells was
calculated to evaluate the in vitro growth rate of the
cell lines in the absence of CDV. As cancer cells are by
definition fast proliferating cells, the tumor cell lines
showed shorter doubling time than normal cells (Table 1).
A significant difference in doubling time was observed
between PET cells and all the cancer cells while PHK
showed a significantly longer doubling time than the
tumor cells except for SCC-147, UM-SCC-104 and UDSCC-2. Differences in doubling time between tumor cells
and HEL cells were observed for most of the tumor cells
except for SCC-147, UM-SCC-104, UT-SCC-45, UDSCC-2 and SCC-4.
A correlation between doubling time and CC50
values of all tested cell types, including normal cells, was
observed at day 3 (p < 0.001), 5 (p < 0.05), 7 (p < 0.01)
and 10 (p < 0.05) post-treatment, indicating that the
growth of slow proliferating cells is less inhibited by CDV
than that of fast proliferating cells (Figure 2A). When
the normal cells were excluded from the analysis, only a
significant correlation between CC50 values and doubling
time was observed after 3 days of treatment (p < 0.01)
but not at later time points (Figure 2B), indicating that the
sensitivity of tumor cells to CDV does not depend on their
growth rate at the later time points.
Based on these results, representative cell lines were
selected for further studies on CDV metabolism, drug

incorporation into DNA and induction of DNA damage
in order to investigate the antiproliferative mechanisms
of CDV. Cervical cancer cell lines were selected to have
a representative HPV16+ and HPV18+ cell line (SiHa
and HeLa, respectively) and an HPV− cell line (C33A).
One HPV16+ (SCC-147) and one HPV− (SCC-120)
HNSCC were also selected as well as the spontaneously
transformed keratinocytes (HaCaT). The normal cells
(PHKs, PET and HEL) were included as controls.

CDV metabolism and incorporation into DNA
CDV metabolism and incorporation into DNA were
examined following incubation of the different cell types
with radiolabeled compound. The CDV metabolites in
the methanol soluble fraction were separated by HPLC
analysis (Table 2). In all cell types, non-metabolized CDV
and its depot form (i.e. CDVp-choline) were detected at
higher levels than the two phosphorylated metabolites
(i.e. CDVp and CDVpp). CDVp was less abundant than
CDVpp in all the cell types except for PET cells. It
needs to be mentioned that the amount of CDVpp in the
methanol soluble fraction represents the free metabolite
and therefore, does not include CDV incorporated into
cellular DNA.
A comparison of the sum of all metabolites in tumor
cells versus normal cells showed higher amounts in PHKs
and PET cells than in tumor cell lines (i.e. SiHa, HeLa,
C33A, HaCaT, SCC-120 and SCC-147) and HEL cells.
HaCaT had the lowest level of total metabolites among all
the tested cell types.
To determine the level of CDV incorporated into
DNA, the radioactivity recovered from the methanol
insoluble fraction was measured. Normal cells had lower
amounts of CDV incorporated into DNA than the tested
tumor cells, however the differences were statistically
non-significant (Table 2). In Table 3, the incorporation
of CDV in tumor cells relative to normal cells is shown.
Tumor cells incorporated more CDV than PHKs (1.1
to 2.1 folds), HEL cells (1.1 to 2.2 folds) and PET cells
(2.1 to 4.1 folds). For all the tested cell types, including
normal cells, a negative correlation (p < 0.05) between
doubling time and CDV incorporation into DNA was
observed at day 3 post-treatment, indicating that fast
proliferating cells incorporate more CDV than cells with a
slower growth rate (Figure 3).
We also analyzed whether a correlation between
CDV incorporation into genomic DNA and CC50 values
exists since the latter parameter estimates the net outcome
of CDV treatment in terms of antiproliferative effects. A
negative correlation (p < 0.05) between CDV incorporation
and CC50’s was observed (Figure 4) revealing that the cells
that are more prone to CDV antiproliferative effects (i.e.
with low CC50 values) had the highest CDV incorporation
into the genomic DNA.

DNA damage signaling after CDV treatment

Importantly, phospho-ATM (activated ATM) levels
were elevated in all CDV treated cells compared to
untreated cells at almost all time points (Figures 5 and 7).
A significant enhancement of phospho-ATM was seen
after 3, 5 and 7 days post-CDV exposure in transformed
cell lines (except for C33A in which ATM was not
activated after 3 days post-treatment) and in the normal
cells (i.e. PHK, HEL and PET).

To investigate DNA damage induction by CDV, the
activation of ATM was measured at different time points
post-exposure to CDV. Western blot analysis showed that
CDV treatment did not increase or decrease the amount of
total ATM except for a lower expression of ATM at day 7
in SiHa cells and at day 3 in PET cells (Figures 5 and 6).

measures γ-H2AX (i.e. H2AX phosphorylated at S139 by

Because SiHa cells had the lowest CC50 values
among all tested cells, the induction of DSBs by different
concentrations of CDV was determined in SiHa cells
after 3 days of drug exposure. The percentage of cells
with DNA damage increased in function of the CDV
concentration (1 µg/ml to 100 µg/ml) (Figure 8A). Based

The activation of ATM in CDV treated cells
gives a good indication of the induction of DSBs by
CDV. However, ATM-activation is not correlated with
the amount of DSBs [33]. Therefore, quantification of
DSBs was performed using a flow cytometric assay that

on these data, CDV concentrations of 5 and 50 µg/ml were
used to evaluate DNA damage induction in all cell types
after 3 days of drug exposure.
When cells were treated with 5 µg/ml CDV, a
difference in DNA damage induction between treated
and untreated tumor cells was detected for HPV16+ cells
(SiHa and SCC-147) (p < 0.05) and C33A cells (p < 0.01)
but not for HeLa, SCC-120 and HaCaT cells (Figure 8B).
At a CDV concentration of 50µg/ml, a significant
difference in DNA damage between treated and untreated
cells was observed for the different tumor cell lines

tested (Figure 8B). In contrast to tumor cells, normal
cells exposed or not to 5 or 50 µg/ml of CDV showed no
differences in the percentage of cells with DNA damage
(Figure 8C).
A negligible amount of γ-H2AX was found in
untreated cells and this intrinsic γ-H2AX can vary among
cell lines [34]. Therefore, the percentage of cells with
DNA damage in untreated cells was subtracted from that
of CDV-treated cells in order to compare the different cell
types. The comparison of CDV-induced DNA damage in
tumor cell lines versus normal cells is shown in Figure 8D.

was calculated and used for normalization of the values per blot. Statistical significance was indicated as follows: p < 0.05 (*). Values are

SiHa, C33A and HaCaT (in contrast to the other tumor cells)
showed higher amounts of DNA damage than PHKs after
5 µg/ml CDV treatment (Figure 8D, up). All tumor cells,
except for SCC-120, experienced more DNA damage than
PET cells upon treatment with 5µg/ml CDV. In addition, at
this dose of CDV, HEL cells underwent significantly less
DNA damage than most tumor cells, except for SCC-120
and SCC-147. When the DNA damage in normal versus
tumor cells after treatment with 50 µg/ml of CDV was
examined (Figure 8D, down), all tumor cells lines showed
significantly higher DNA damage than HEL and PET

cells. Only SiHa and C33A cells underwent significantly
more DNA damage than PHKs at the highest CDV
concentration tested. (except for SCC-120 and HaCaT)
Flow cytometric analysis using propidium iodide
(PI) and γ-H2AX staining showed that CDV-induced
DSBs were present in each phase of the cell cycle (Data
not shown). Thus, tumor cells in all phases of the cell
cycle were equally sensitive to DNA damage.
Finally, the CC50 values and the levels of CDV
incorporation and drug-induced DNA damage were
compared to detect potential correlations. A positive

tested here, unmetabolized CDV and CDVp-choline were
the most abundant fractions detected, what is in agreement
with previous data on CDV metabolism [32]. Our findings
indicate that a substantial amount of the administered CDV
is not metabolized. Furthermore, the long half-life (87 h)
of CDVp-choline [38] could explain its high abundance in
the cells. The monophosphate form (CDVp), which has the
shortest half-life (24 h), was the least abundant metabolite.
Among the cell lines evaluated, HaCaT displayed a
significantly lower sum of CDV metabolites, which could
be attributed to changes in uptake and/or efflux of CDV,
rather than to a difference in drug metabolism, since the
amount of parent CDV was also lower in HaCaT than
in the other cells. The higher levels of total metabolites
in normal cells (PHK and PET) may be due to a higher
activity of the enzymes responsible for CDV activation
and/or more efficient drug uptake by these cells. However,
CDV incorporation into DNA was lower in normal cells
than in transformed cells. One can hypothesize that
normal cells are able to remove incorporated CDVpp
while transformed cells have alterations in their DNA
damage repair mechanisms impeding drug excision. On
the other hand, tumor cells proliferate faster than normal
cells and therefore can incorporate more CDVpp. This
last hypothesis is supported by the correlation between
doubling time and CDV incorporation into DNA.
Induction of DNA damage may be an additional
factor in the selectivity of CDV for tumor cells since
normal cells are capable of repairing DNA damage while
tumor cells often lack this capability [7]. The E6 and E7
HPV oncoproteins override the G1/S-phase checkpoint
hampering DNA damage repair in HPV+ transformed cells
[5, 6]. Previous publications also suggested that HPV+
cells are more sensitive to radiation due to an impaired
DNA damage response [39, 40]. Our experiments show
that the failure of HPV+ cells to repair DNA damage
does not occur at the beginning of the homologous
recombination repair pathway since increase in phosphoATM after CDV treatment was found in all HPV+ cells.
The augmentation of phospho-ATM in CDV-treated cells
is in line with a previous gene expression analysis of PHKs
[32], suggesting that induction of DSBs and activation of
DNA DSB repair by homologous recombination occurs
following CDV treatment.
Because phospho-ATM levels were elevated in all
cell lines exposed to CDV (including normal cells), DSBs
were quantified by measuring γ-H2AX. Importantly, in
tumor cells there was significantly more DNA damage in
CDV-treated than in untreated cells, which was not the
case in normal cells. Furthermore, a statistically significant
difference in induction of DNA damage was seen between
most of the tumor cell lines and normal cells, as evidenced
by γ-H2AX levels. Induction of DSBs by CDV was not
linked to HPV positivity nor tumor type (cervical or head
and neck), similar to CDV antiproliferative effects and
drug incorporation into DNA. Nevertheless, no correlation

correlation (p < 0.05) between CDV incorporation into
DNA and DNA damage was found (Figure 9A) while there
was no correlation between CC50 values and DNA damage
(Figure 9B).

DISCUSSION
The antiproliferative effects of CDV were studied
in nine HPV+, six HPV− cell lines (including cervical
carcinoma and HNSCC) and three different normal cell
types (PHKs, HEL and PET cells). Tumor cells proved
to be more responsive to CDV antiproliferative activities
than normal cells, as indicated by the lower CC50
values obtained for the tumor cell lines. Here we have
demonstrated that CDV is also active against HNSCC
regardless of HPV status. The growth of PHKs was
relatively more inhibited by CDV in comparison with the
two other tested normal cells (HEL and PET), which could
be explained by the fact that keratinocytes were artificially
grown in a monolayer causing stress to these cells that are
programmed to differentiate.
Our results show that the antiproliferative activity
of CDV is time- and dose-dependent, as shown previously
[23]. Interestingly, a decrease in CC50 values in function
of time was not found for other anti-tumor drugs such as
cytarabine and 5-fluorouracil [23]. Although differences
in response to CDV were detected among the various
cell lines, these differences were not related to HPV
status nor to tumor type (i.e. originating form cervical
or head and neck tissues), indicating that CDV may be
considered a broad-spectrum anti-tumor agent. Hadaczek
et al. also showed that CDV inhibits glioblastoma both
in vitro and in vivo, regardless of the presence of human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [25], however a role for HCMV
in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma is controversial [35].
It was previously shown that the in vitro and in vivo
antiproliferative activities of CDV against nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (which is driven by Epstein-Barr virus) were
not due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase [27].
Furthermore, the activity of CDV against polyomavirus
(PyV)-induced hemangioma in vivo could not be explained
by an antiviral mechanism [26].
The correlation between CC50 values and doubling
time indicates that the selectivity of CDV may be
explained, at least in part, by a more potent inhibition of
cell growth on fast proliferating cells (tumor cells) than
on normal cells (which have slower proliferation rates).
When the normal cells were excluded from the analysis, a
significant correlation between CC50’s and doubling time
was only observed at day 3 post-treatment but not at later
time points. Spanos et al. described a correlation between
CDV antiproliferative activities and doubling time in
HNSCC after 4 days of treatment [36].
CDV selectivity for tumor cells could also be
explained by a differential metabolism of the drug in
malignant versus normal cells [37]. In all the cell types

between DNA damage and CDV antiproliferative effects
were observed suggesting that the mode of action of CDV
cannot be solely explained by induction of DNA damage.
Regarding CDV antiproliferative effects, SiHa
cells (HPV16+ cervical carcinoma) proved to be the most
sensitive among all the tumor cell lines evaluated in this
study. Even though H2AX phosphorylation in CDV-exposed
SiHa and C33A cells was comparable, C33A showed higher
CC50 values than SiHa. HeLa cells presented higher CC50
values than SCC-120 and HaCaT cells, but had more DNA
damage after CDV exposure than SCC-120 and HaCaT
cells. One can hypothesize that induction of DNA damage
would lead to a decrease in CC50 values, unless the DNA
damage is repaired. When the two tumor cell lines showing
the lowest DNA damage (i.e. HaCaT and SCC-120)
were excluded from the analysis of CC50’s and DNA
damage, a significant correlation (p < 0.05) between DNA
damage and antiproliferative effects was found (Data not
shown). These data suggest that HaCaT and SCC-120 cells
are capable of (partially) repairing DNA damage although
these cells were also shown to be sensitive to CDV. Taken

together, our findings indicate that CDV antiproliferative
activities are due to the induction of DNA damage but in
contrast to most chemotherapeutics, additional effects can
be deduced. Induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest or an
increase in tumor suppressors such as p53, pRb or p21,
which have been already described for CDV-treated HPV+
cells, could be a consequence of CDV incorporation into
DNA [41]. However, activation of inflammatory responses
(such as “NF-κB signaling” and “acute phase response”),
retinoid X receptor pathways and Rho GTPase pathways
among others should be taken into account to explain CDV
antiproliferative activities [32].
One would expect no ATM phosphorylation in
normal cells since there is no phosphorylation of H2AX
in normal cells following 3 days of CDV treatment.
However, in all the normal cells (PHK, HEL and PET) a
significant enhancement of phospho-ATM was observed
after 3, 5 and 7 days of CDV treatment. This discordance
may be explained by the fact that ATM is not used as a
marker for DSBs because it is not correlated with the
amount of DSBs (ATM only needs 8 breaks per cell in

Figure 9: Correlation between CC50 values, DNA damage and CDV incorporation at day 3 post-treatment. Correlations

between (A) DNA damage and CDV incorporation and (B) CC50 values and DNA damage were evaluated with the Pearson correlation

order to be phosphorylated) [42]. In contrast, the intensity
of γ-H2AX immunofluorescence was shown to correlate
with the frequency of DSBs [34]. For this reason γ-H2AX
was used in our studies as a quantitative marker for DSBs.
We assume that CDV causes DSBs in normal cells that
are sensed by ATM and then repaired by DNA repair
mechanisms. Even a small amount of DSBs would be
sufficient to activate ATM but it would not be high enough
to cause a significant difference in phosphorylation of
H2AX. After an initial step of ATM phosphorylation, the
existing damage is evaluated [43] and if the damage is
repaired, phospho-ATM is dephosphorylated by Wip1
and PP2A. In case of persistent DNA damage, there is
a new peak of ATM-phosphorylation [9, 43]. Thus, in
contrast to normal cells, phospho-ATM may accumulate
in tumor cells after CDV exposure because of persistent
DNA damage. The accumulation of breaks in tumor cells
is deduced from the high amount of cells with γ-H2AX
immunofluorescence. To conclude, the levels of γ-H2AX
and phospho-ATM do not evolve in parallel because
γ-H2AX is correlated with the amount of DSBs whereas
activation of ATM takes place even when there is only a
limited amount of DSBs and does not correlate with the
amount of DSBs [33].
A discrepancy between γ-H2AX and phosphoATM was also observed for C33A cells that showed a
high amount of phosphorylated H2AX upon 3 days of
50 µg/ml CDV treatment while no significant increase
of phospho-ATM was observed at this time point. This
could be explained by the fact that in response to DNA
damage, all three phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related
kinases (PIKKs): ATM, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3related protein (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinases
(DNA-PKcs) can phosphorylate H2AX as previously
reported following DNA damage caused by ionizing
radiation [44]. Additionally, it is not yet clear which PIKK
is responsible for H2AX phosphorylation during apoptosis.
This is consistent with formerly reported data showing that
UV-induced replication stress triggers activation of ATR
and DNA PKcs rather than ATM [45]. Most publications,
however, point out that the induction of DSBs triggers
phosphorylation of H2AX by ATM [33, 46, 47].
In conclusion, we have shown here the
antiproliferative effects of CDV against cervical carcinoma
and HNSCC HPV+ and HPV− cells. CDV antiproliferative
effects were correlated with drug incorporation into DNA.
Moreover, CDV incorporation was correlated with DNA
damage, indicating that CDV incorporation causes DNA
damage. However, the anti-tumor effect of CDV cannot
be explained exclusively by DNA damage, since no
correlation was observed between DNA damage and CDV
antiproliferative effects. These data support the concept of
CDV as a general anti-cancer agent not restricted to HPV+
tumor cells [25–28, 48]. Our results contribute to a better
insight into the selective mechanism of CDV anti-tumor
activities which is crucial for the development of new
strategies to treat HPV-associated neoplasias that cannot

be cured with standard therapies. In addition, our work
sets up the basis for further investigations on the mode of
action of CDV and on the DNA repair mechanism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
HPV+ and HPV− cell lines derived from cervical
carcinoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) were compared to spontaneously transformed
keratinocytes (HaCaT), primary human keratinocytes
(PHKs), primary epithelial tonsil (PET) cells and human
embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts. Cervical cancer
cell lines: SiHa (HPV16+) (ATCC HTB-35™), HeLa
(HPV18+) (ATCC CCL-2™), Caski (HPV16+) (ATCC
CRL-1550) and C33A (HPV−) (ATCC HTB-31™) were
obtained from ATCC (Manassas, USA). CK1 (HPV33+)
cells were kindly provided by Jaques Piette (Departement
of Life Sciences, University of Liège, Belgium). The
HNSCC SCC-9 (ATCC CRL-1629™) and SCC-4 (ATCC
CRL-1624™) (both HPV-) were obtained from ATCC;
93VU147T later called SCC-147 (HPV16+) and 93VU120
later called SCC-120 (HPV-) were kindly provided by
Mario Hermsen (Department of Otolaryngology, Instituto
Universitario de Oncología del Principado de Asturias
(IUOPA), Spain); UM-SCC-47 (HPV16+), UM-SCC-104
(HPV16+) and UM-SCC-38 (HPV-) were purchased from
the University of Michigan (USA); UT-SCC-45 (HPV33+)

transformed keratinocytes from histologically normal
skin (HaCaT) were kindly provided by F. De Marco
(Laboratory of Virology, Regina Elena Institute for Cancer
Research, Rome, Italy). Human embryonic lung (HEL)
fibroblasts (HEL-299: ATCC CCL-137) were grown
in Earle’s minimum essential medium (MEM Earle’s,
Life Technologies, Merelbeke, Belgium) containing
8% fetal calf serum. PET and PHK were isolated from
tonsils and from neonatal foreskins, respectively, as
previously described [49] and cultured in KeratinocyteSFM Medium (Gibco, Life Technologies). All cancer cell
lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Gibco, Life Technologies) except for SCC-4
and SCC-9 which were grown in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium plus F12 (Gibco, Life Technologies). All
media were supplemented with 1% non-essential amino
acids (MEM NEAA, Gibco by Life Technologies), 1%

described previously [32]. The soluble fraction of this
MeOH extraction (200 µl) was injected onto a HPLC
system equipped with an anion-exchange Partisphere SAX
column (Hichrom limited, Berkshire, UK) and separation
was performed with a gradient of two phosphate buffers;
5 mM NH4H2PO4, pH 6.5 and 0.3 M NH4H2PO4, pH
6.5 at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. One-minute fractions of
the eluate were collected, mixed with HiSafe 3 cocktail
(Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) and analyzed for
radioactivity in a scintillation counter. The retention
times of CDV and its metabolites were: 3 min for CDVpcholine, 5 min for CDV, 15 min for CDVp, and 19 min
for CDVpp. To determine the incorporation of CDV into
nucleic acids, the methanol-insoluble pellets were digested
with 500 µl 5N NaOH during 24 hours at 37°C. The
solution was neutralized with 500 µl 5N HCl, then mixed
with HiSafe 3 cocktail and analyzed for total radioactivity.

The presence or absence of the HPV genome in all
the aforementioned cells was confirmed by performing a
specific PCR. DNA was extracted with a QIAamp DNA
mini kit (Qiagen Benelux, Netherlands) following the
instructions of the manufacturer, followed by PCR to
confirm whether the cell lines were HPV16+, HPV18+,
HPV33+ or HPV−. Specific primers for each HPV type
(supplementary Table 1) were purchased from Eurofins
(Brugge, Belgium).

Antiviral compound
Cidofovir (CDV) or (S)-HPMPC, [(S)-1-[3hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]cytosine] was
obtained from Gilead Sciences (Foster city, Ca, USA). It
was prepared in PBS at a stock concentration of 10 mg/
ml. Radiolabeled [5-3H]-CDV (1mCi/ml; specific activity:
25 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals
(Brea, CA, USA) and stored at −20°C in ethanol/water 1:1.

Protein extract preparation and immunoblotting
Protein extracts were obtained at 3, 5 and 7 days of
no treatment or treatment with 50 µg/ml CDV. Whole cell
lysates were prepared in Ripa buffer (Thermo Scientific,
Brussels, Belgium) containing protease (Complete Mini,
EDTA-free, Sigma-Aldrich, Diegem, Belgium) and
phosphatase inhibitors (Active Motif, La Hulpe, Belgium).
Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA assay
(Thermo Scientific). Separation of proteins was performed
with SDS-PAGE. Western Blot analysis was performed
with anti-phospho-ATM (Ser1981) clone 10H11.
E12 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and anti-ATM
antibody (ab32420, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Relative
quantification was performed using actin (ab3280, Abcam)
as a loading control. For each blot, the sum of intensity
values was calculated and used for normalization of the
values per blot.

Antiproliferative effects
Cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at an
amount ranging from 2.5 × 103 to 6 × 103 cells per well,
determined for each cell line (2.5 × 103 for SiHa, HeLa,
C33A, SCC-120, SCC-9, UM-SCC-47 and UM-SCC-38;
3 × 103 for HaCaT; 3.5 × 103 for HEL; 4 × 103 for Caski,
SCC-4, CK1, UT-SCC-45 and UD-SCC-2; and 6 × 103 for
SCC-147, PHK, PET and UM-SCC-104). After 24 hours,
medium containing different concentrations of CDV,
ranging from 0.05 µg/ml to 200 µg/ml, was added to the
cells (in duplicate). After 3, 5, 7 and 10 days, the cells
were trypsinized and counted with a Coulter counter. The
antiproliferative effects were expressed as the compound
concentration needed to inhibit cell growth by 50% (CC50).

DNA damage induced by CDV by means of
γ-H2AX analysis

In vitro growth rate
The doubling time (DT) of the different cell lines
was determined in 96-well microtiter plates. At several
time points, the number of cells was determined with a
Coulter counter. DT was calculated with the formula: DT
= (t2-t1)/(log2N2-log2N1), where t1 and t2 are the times (in
hours) at which the cells were counted, and N1 and N2 are
the cell numbers at times t1 and t2.

DNA damage was evaluated by means of a
FlowCellect TM cell cycle Checkpoint H2A.X DNA
damage kit (Millipore). Briefly, cells were seeded in
culture flasks for 24 hours before adding 5 or 50 µg/ml
CDV. After three days of incubation, the cells were fixed,
permeabilized and stained with propidium iodide and
anti-γ-H2AX antibody. Samples were read with a BD
FACSCalibur.

Metabolism and incorporation of CDV into DNA

Statistical analysis

Cells were grown in 75 cm2 culture flasks for 24
hours before adding unlabeled CDV combined with
[5-3H]-CDV at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml and 10
μCi per flask. After 3 days of incubation, samples for
HPLC analysis were prepared by methanol extraction as

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad
Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla,
CA, USA). To evaluate the antiproliferative effects
of CDV over time and to compare treated cells with
untreated cells for DNA damage, a paired t-test was used.

for CC50 values, DT, metabolites, incorporation into DNA,
and DNA damage. Pearson correlations were assessed
comparing DT and CC50; CC50 and DNA damage; CC50
and DNA incorporation and DNA damage and DNA
incorporation. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.
