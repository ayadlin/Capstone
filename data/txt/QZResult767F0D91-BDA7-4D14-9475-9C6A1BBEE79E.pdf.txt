BACKGROUND. Dexamethasone improves the cure rate of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but causes physical and behavioral adverse events.
The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of dexamethasone
exposure on sleep and fatigue in pediatric patients with ALL.

METHODS. One hundred pediatric patients with low-risk or standard-risk ALL
were enrolled on 1 of 3 protocols (St. Jude Total XV, Children’s Oncology Group
[COG] 9904, or COG 9905) at 3 institutions. The mean age of the cohort was
9.24  3.23 years (range, 5.03-18.14 years). The majority of patients were white
(79%) males (62%) with standard-risk ALL (63%). The cohort was divided into 4
subgroups: St. Jude low-risk, St. Jude standard-risk, COG low-risk, and COG
standard-risk. Patients wore a wrist actigraph to monitor sleep activity during 2
consecutive 5-day periods: During the first period, they did not receive dexamethasone; and, during the second period, they did. Patients and their parents
completed fatigue instruments on Days 2 and 5 of each period, and parents completed sleep diaries.

RESULTS. Actual sleep minutes, sleep duration, total daily nap minutes, and fatigue increased significantly during the dexamethasone treatment for 3 to 4 of

examethasone is central to contemporary treatment of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) because of the drug’s marked
antileukemic effects compared with other glucocorticoids, such as
prednisone.1–12 Although it is highly effective in the treatment of
ALL, dexamethasone also is associated with adverse behavioral
events, including mania, psychosis, and altered sleep and fatigue.11–15
Because dexamethasone evokes variable patient responses,16 it is possible that behavioral responses are related to interindividual variability in systemic exposure to dexamethasone. Before we can determine
tailored dosing schedules, we must establish the correlation between
dexamethasone and adverse behavioral effects, particularly sleep and
fatigue.
The frequency of adverse events related to sleep and fatigue
caused by dexamethasone in pediatric ALL therapy is unknown.

Earlier studies of the effects of short-term, high-dose
prednisone therapy on behavior, mood, and sleep of
pediatric oncology patients. as reported by their parents, indicated significant negative change in the
child’s attention/hyperactivity, emotional lability,
sleep quality, and mood during the on-prednisone
week compared with the off-prednisone week.13,14 In
2 cases of mania or panic in adolescent girls who
received dexamethasone as part of their treatment
for ALL, the initial symptom was disrupted sleep.15
Sleep in well and chronically ill children and
adolescents is a complex, vulnerable process involving multiple physiologic body systems that are
influenced by certain dynamic biologic, social, cultural, and psychologic factors that simultaneously
affect each other.17,18 Sleep in children and adolescents evolves in somewhat predictable ways, with
decreasing nighttime and daytime sleeping and
nighttime awakenings occurring with age.18–22
Reported outcomes of disrupted or poor-quality
sleep are increased daytime sleepiness and inattentive behaviors,23,24 irritability and altered mood,25–27
reduced ability to learn and use executive functioning abilities,28–32 lower perceived health-related quality of life and well being,33,34 and adversely affected
immune system indicators.35 Sleep is sensitive to
acute and chronic illnesses and related stressors,
such as hospitalizations, and to medications, including glucocorticoids.36 Disrupted sleep patterns,
including those induced by illness and medications,
can persist once they are established.37,38 Sleep quality and fatigue of children and adolescents on and
off dexamethasone for the treatment of ALL have not
been reported previously.
The objective of the current study was to determine the correlation between systemic exposure to
dexamethasone and sleep quality and fatigue levels
in pediatric patients during continuation therapy for
childhood ALL. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) Dexamethasone contributes to changes in sleep efficiency,
actual sleep minutes, sleep duration, nocturnal awakenings, total daily sleep minutes, and daily nap
minutes and increased fatigue in children and adolescents; and 2) patient demographic variables (ie,
age, sex, and ALL risk category) influence the extent
of change in sleep and fatigue observed during dexamethasone treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Eligible patients were ages 5 to 18 years and were
receiving continuation therapy for ALL at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude), Texas Chil-

dren’s Cancer Center (TCCC), or the Hospital for Sick
Children. Patients at St. Jude were treated on the
Total XV protocol; patients at TCCC or at the Hospital for Sick Children were treated on Children’s Oncology Group (COG) 9904 or COG 9905 studies. No
data were collected until after Week 50. The timing
of the 10-day data collection periods was selected for
1) similarity in treatment across risk groups within
each ALL clinical trial, 2) less intense treatment
demands on patients and families, 3) availability of
patients and parents at the treatment settings for
planned return visits, and 4) ability to maintain the
same sleep environment (the patients’ homes) for
the 10-day study period. Only patients in the low- or
standard-risk ALL categories participated in this
study, because treatment for high-risk or very-highrisk ALL differs considerably from the treatment for
low- and standard-risk ALL.
Patients needed to be English speaking, willing
to provide consent according to institutional guidelines, and had parental consent to participate. There
were no exclusions based on concurrent drugs. Eligible parents were English speaking, willing to participate in this study, and willing to allow their child to
participate in the study. The study was approved by
the institutional review boards at all 3 study sites.

The ALL Protocols
The objective of Total XV, COG 9904, and COG 9905
protocols is to increase the cure rate in children and
adolescents with ALL with the use of risk-directed
therapy. The criteria used in risk classification are
summarized in Table 1. Dexamethasone dosing is
substantially higher in the Total XV protocol than in
the COG protocols (Table 2). Therefore, for our study,
the St. Jude (Total XV) patients were analyzed separately from patients who were treated at the other
sites on the 2 COG protocols.
Study Design
Patients served as their own control. The 10-day
study included 2 treatment periods: During the first
5 days, patients did not receive dexamethasone (offdex); and during the second consecutive 5 days, they
did (on-dex). Patients wore an actigraph on their
dominant wrist 24 hours a day for 10 days. Parents
and patients who were age 7 years independently
completed fatigue instruments on Days 2 and 5 of
each treatment period, and parents completed a
sleep diary on those same days. This 10-day design
exceeded the criterion for number of nighttime
recordings needed to obtain reliable actigraph
assessments of sleep in children and adolescents.39

Sleep Measures
Wrist actigraphy
The Micromini (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley,
NY) is a wristwatch-style device that contains a biaxial piezoelectric sensor and a microprocessor with
programmable epoch length. The system’s accompanying software was used to compute the sleep characteristics (defined in Fig. 1). Sadeh’s algorithm
(previously validated against polysomnography in
children40) is the basis of the sleep-wake scoring
used in the software program.
Sleep Diary-Parent
The sleep diary is a 16-item report that was derived
from work by Sadeh et al41 that documents the parents’ daily perceptions of their child’s sleep and nap
patterns during the previous 24-hour period and is
completed in 6 to 8 minutes.
Fatigue Measures
Fatigue Scale-Child
The Fatigue Scale-Child (FS-C), which was designed
for children ages 7 to 12 years, is a 14-item, selfreport instrument that scores the intensity of the
patient’s fatigue on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 0

(no fatigue symptoms) to 70 (high fatigue) and
requires from 6 to 8 minutes to complete.42–44 In this
study, the Cronbach a coefficients ranged from .72
to .81.

Fatigue Scale-Adolescent
The Fatigue Scale-Adolescent, which was designed
for adolescents ages 13 to 18 years, is a 14-item, selfreport instrument that measures adolescents’ cancerrelated fatigue on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 14
(no fatigue symptoms) to 70 (high fatigue) and
requires from 3 to 4 minutes to complete.42,43,45 In
this study, the Cronbach a coefficients ranged from
.89 to .95.
Fatigue Scale-Parent
The Fatigue Scale-Parent consists of 17 items that
measure the parents’ perception of their child’s fatigue on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 17 (no fatigue) to 85 (high fatigue) and can be completed in 7
to 10 minutes.44 In this study, the Cronbach a coefficients ranged from .91 to .92.
Concurrent Medications
A study team member completed concurrent medication data forms based on information from parents
and a medical record review of medications the child
received during the 2 5-day study periods. Fortyeight different medications were administered during
the first 5-day period, and all but 7 were considered
ongoing medications for the patient; 53 different
medications were administered during the second 5day period, and all but 18 were considered ongoing.

during the on-dex week, the majority were related to
procedures that were considered a single event.
Transfusion status also was monitored, but no participant received a transfusion during the study period.
Hemoglobin values ranged from 9.1 g/dL to 13.8 g/
dL across both 5-day periods.

Sample Size Considerations
The sample-size justification was based initially on
the only available sleep and steroid coefficients
(sleep efficiency and prednisone) in children and
adolescents with ALL; we then re-estimated sample
size by using the data collected from the first 46
study participants (26 patients at St. Jude and 20
patients at TCCC). We used baseline values for sleep
efficiency during the off-dex week to obtain an estimate of variability to be used in the sample-size calculation and completed 2 separate calculations: 1 for
Total XV and 1 for COG 9904 and COG 9905. Similar
to the effects of prednisone on sleep efficiency, we

anticipated that dexamethasone would have detrimental effects on sleep and, thus, based our sample
estimates on a 1-sided hypothesis. We projected that
a change of 10 U on dexamethasone would be important clinically. To detect this difference with 80%
power at an level a of .05 and assuming a 1-sided
test, approximately 27 evaluable patients were to be
enrolled from each of 4 risk groups: St. Jude low risk,
St. Jude standard risk, COG low risk, and COG standard risk. Given the lower enrollment in the COG lowrisk group (n 5 13 patients), findings from the offdex versus the on-dex analyses for this risk group are
considered exploratory.

Sample Characteristics
We enrolled 100 patients in the study. The majority
were white boys between ages of 7 years and 12
years who met the criteria for either the St. Jude or
COG standard-risk group. The distribution of patients
by age, sex, race, and risk group is presented in Table 3.

Actigraph data are not available for 12 of the study
participants because of actigraph failure or insufficient recordings, a rate that is less than half of the
rate (28%) reported previously in pediatric studies.19

Statistical Analyses
To compare the average scores of study variables
between the 2 5-day study periods, we used a 1-sample Student t test. Only those patients who had at
least 3 of 5 days of actigraph data during each period
were included in this analysis. Subsequently, longitudinal methods (PROC MIXED) that incorporated all
observations were used to analyze the data, and the
conclusions obtained from the 2 approaches were
compared. Testing of the regression coefficient corresponding to risk group provided the evidence of difference in sleep and fatigue between the 2 study
periods. We completed a similar analysis for all dependent measures based on actigraph measures and
parent sleep diaries. After primary analyses were
completed, we calculated observed power for each
sleep variable (results not shown).
For fatigue data, we calculated a summed score
for each fatigue questionnaire at each time point. We
computed the average fatigue score for each study period and tested whether the differences between those
2 scores were significantly different from zero by
using the 1-sample Student t test. We also used the

RESULTS
Dexamethasone Alters Most Sleep Parameters in
Pediatric Patients With ALL
According to the actigraphy measurements, dexamethasone treatment was associated significantly
with increases in sleep duration, actual sleep minutes, total daily sleep minutes, and total daily nap
minutes and with decreased nocturnal awakenings
(Table 4). During the on-dex period, the average
actual sleep minutes, average sleep duration, and average nap minutes increased significantly in 2 of the
4 risk groups, and average total daily sleep minutes
increased significantly in 3 of the 4 risk groups (Table
5). Parents’ responses in the sleep diary indicated significant increases in their child’s nighttime awakenings, restless sleep, and nap time in 1 to 4 of the risk
groups during the on-dex period and in tiredness
and loss of energy during the on-dex period across
all 4 risk groups (Table 4).
Dexamethasone Increases Fatigue
Patient self-reports of fatigue
Results of the PROC MIXED analysis indicated significant increases in FS-C scores between the 2 5-day
periods within each risk group and across all 4 risk
groups (P < .0001). Significant increases in fatigue
also were evident in the COG standard-risk group
(P 5 .014) and in the total patient group of patients
ages 13 years to 18 years (P 5 .007) (Table 4). Significant increases in fatigue between the measurement
days (Days 2 and 5) of each 5-day period also were
observed (Table 6).
Parental reports of patient fatigue
Parents reported significant increases in their child’s
fatigue during the on-dex period for every risk group
at both data comparison points (Table 4). The PROC
MIXED analyses yielded results similar to those
obtained using the t test.
Demographic Variables Influence Dexamethasoneinduced Changes in Sleep

P 5 .002). Finally, the St. Jude low-risk group had
more nocturnal awakenings per night than the COG
low-risk group (regression coefficient, 5.23; P 5 .011)
and the COG standard-risk group (regression coefficient, 3.83; P 5 .038).

Patient age
Age was associated with change in sleep duration
(coefficient, 25.95; P 5 .018). Older patients were in
bed less during the on-dex period. Older age also
was associated with less total daily sleep minutes
(coefficient, 28.39; P 5 .002).
Sex
Boys experienced significantly more nocturnal awakenings per night (coefficient, 3.19; P 5 .020) than
girls. However, girls napped more (coefficient, 17.07;
P 5 .027). More nocturnal awakenings were associated with lower sleep efficiency (coefficient,
20.6201; P 5 .016).
Parental Sleep Diary Findings
On Day 2 of the off-dex period, parental sleep diary
data significantly exceeded actigraph data for 3
groups (St. Jude: low-risk group, t 5 22.51; P 5 .02;
standard-risk group, t 5 22.33; P 5 .027; COG: lowrisk group, t 5 23.74; P 5 .003). These differences
were limited to the first night of sleep diary monitoring and may reflect the parents’ inexperience with
estimating sleep indicators.
Fatigue Findings
Children experienced significantly more fatigue during the on-dex period than during the off-dex period

(regression coefficient, 6.70; P < .0001), and the fatigue findings were similar for adolescents (regression coefficient, 6.45; P 5 .0074). The extent of change
in child fatigue was not associated with age (P 5 .55),
sex (P 5 .76), or ALL risk group (P 5 .66); likewise,
change in adolescent fatigue was not associated with
age (P 5 .45), sex (P 5 .75), or ALL risk group (P 5 .70).
Parents reported significant increases in their child’s
fatigue during the on-dex period (regression coefficient, 10.11; P < .0001), but their reports were not
associated with patient age (P 5 .86), sex (P 5 .65), or
ALL risk group (P 5 .66).

DISCUSSION
Actigraphic findings from this study indicate that
dexamethasone treatment significantly alters sleep
duration, actual sleep minutes, total daily sleep minutes, nocturnal awakenings, and total daily nap minutes in pediatric patients with ALL. Patient and
parent fatigue reports both indicate that dexamethasone is associated with significantly increased fatigue. These findings confirm that altered sleep and
fatigue are behavioral responses to dexamethasone.
The average sleep efficiency in the 4 risk groups
for both 5-day study periods was lower than that of
pediatric inpatients on a psychiatric unit (91.9%) and
of healthy adolescents who were monitored for 1
week (87% and 89%)46,47 and was lower than the
sleep efficiency (90%) that is considered acceptable
for children and adolescents. Only 1 of the 4 risk
groups had an average sleep efficiency that met the
acceptable level during the off-dex period, and none
of the risk groups achieved that standard during the

2328

on-dex period. This indicates that these patients had
poor sleep quality even before they began the dexamethasone period. The poor sleep quality may be
secondary to the treatment for ALL in terms of the
chemotherapeutic agents or the systemic effects of
the treatment.48 but it is not secondary to hospitalization, because none of the patients had been hospitalized during the study period or during the
previous several months. The actigraphy finding of
low sleep efficiency is supported by parent reports of
increased restless sleep of their ill child during the
on-dex period. These combined objective and subjective reports indicate that dexamethasone interferes
with sleep quality. The average actual sleep minutes
in our cohort during both study periods was less
than that reported for pediatric patients ages 7 to 14
years who were hospitalized on a psychiatric unit.47
The average sleep duration for patients during both
study periods exceeded that of pediatric outpatients
with well-controlled asthma (8.2 hours) and that of
age-matched, healthy children (8.3 hours).49 The average sleep duration in our cohort on certain nights
approached or exceeded the recommended sleep
time of 10 to 11 hours for children and 9.2 hours for
adolescents.19,20 In addition, our pediatric cohort
woke up, on average, 12 to 16 times each night (similar to the number of awakenings of 9 children with
ALL who received vincristine during maintenance
therapy but who slept in their home environment50
and similar to the awakenings of 29 pediatric oncology patients who were hospitalized for scheduled
chemotherapy for a solid tumor or acute myeloid
leukemia51), whereas healthy children typically
awaken 1 to 5 or 7 times each night.18,19,52 These
findings indicate that pediatric patients receiving
dexamethasone for ALL have fewer actual sleep minutes, stay in bed longer, but have poorer sleep quality
than well children, children with chronic illnesses, or
hospitalized pediatric patients for illnesses other than
cancer.
ALL risk group was associated significantly with
only 3 sleep variables (sleep efficiency, actual sleep
minutes, and nocturnal awakenings), as measured by
actigraphy. Of the 4 risk groups, the St. Jude standard-risk group received the highest dose of dexamethasone, had significantly lower sleep efficiency
than children in the COG risk groups, and had the
lowest actual sleep minutes and sleep duration of all
4 groups. Dexamethasone treatment, rather than the
ALL risk group, was the more consistent source of
significant influence on sleep outcomes in our study.
Sex did not appear to influence fatigue, but it
did influence 2 sleep variables. Boys experienced
more nocturnal awakenings per night, and girls had

more total daily nap minutes, suggesting that sleep
may be sex-sensitive. In studies of healthy grade
school children and high school youths, girls slept
significantly longer than boys.53,54 Age was not a
consistent factor of influence on sleep or fatigue in
our study. Only 2 sleep variables, sleep duration and
total daily sleep minutes, were associated with age;
the adolescents had less of both compared with the
children.
Although the combined objective and patient
and parent reports indicate that dexamethasone
adversely affects multiple patient sleep-quality indicators and fatigue, the findings do not explicate the
precise mechanism of influence. The significant
increase in fatigue may have contributed to the
extended sleep duration and increased total daily
nap minutes. Together, these influences are known to
interfere with sleep/wake cycles and sleep regulation.48 Alternatively for the patients in the St. Jude
standard-risk group, which experienced significantly
more nocturnal awakenings than the other risk
groups, the resulting sleep fragmentation may have
contributed to these patient’s increased time in bed
as an attempt to recover sleep. Indirectly, the sleep
fragmentation may have contributed to these
patients’ increased fatigue. Finally, individual differences in metabolism of dexamethasone may help to
explain sleep and fatigue responses to dexamethasone. These possible explanations need to be examined in future studies.
The current study had several limitations. The
small number of patients in the COG low-risk group
means that findings specific to that risk group need
to be considered ‘‘exploratory.’’ In addition, our
results primarily represent white boys ages 7 to 12
years with standard-risk ALL. We did not study daytime sleepiness, a variable that has been confused
conceptually with or linked to fatigue,22,23 nor did
we study the functional outcomes of increased
fatigue or altered sleep, such as cognitive or behavioral changes.24,32,54 However, our study strengths
include data collection at 3 pediatric cancer centers,
which adds to the generalizability of study findings,
the high number of fully evaluable patient
responses for fatigue and sleep outcome indicators,
the combination of patient, parent, and objective
reports to study these variables, the ability to compare outcomes from consecutive periods when the
patients did or did not receive dexamethasone, and
the strength of the statistical findings. The clinical
implications of this study include the need to prepare patients and families before the initiation of
continuation therapy for ALL for a likely increase in
sleep duration, actual sleep minutes, and total daily

Dexamethasone Alters Sleep in ALL/Hinds et al.

sleep minutes and fatigue during dexamethasone
treatment.
In conclusion, dexamethasone treatment alters
sleep and fatigue in children and adolescents with
ALL, and the degree of alteration differs by patient
age, sex, and ALL risk category. Our future studies
will examine the relation between these behavioral
indicators and the biologic indicators of individual
responsiveness to dexamethasone. These behavioral
and biologic indicators have the potential to identify
pediatric patients with ALL who will be the most sensitive to dexamethasone treatment, thereby allowing
clinicians to design optimal dosing schedules for
individual patients.
