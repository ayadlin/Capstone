BACKGROUND: High Plasminogen-Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) expression by tumors has been associated with poor
prognosis in several cancer types, and high systemic PAI-1 levels with increased thrombosis risk. The authors investigated whether the germline 4G/5G deletion/insertion polymorphism in the PAI-1 promoter (rs1799889), which may
influence PAI-1 expression, is associated with survival and chemotherapy-related vascular toxicity in testicular cancer
(TC). METHODS: Data were collected on PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism, survival, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and
coronary heart disease (CHD) for 324 non-seminomatous TC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.
Genotypes were compared regarding survival and disease outcome. VTE and CHD incidence were compared with
adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and prothrombotic gene polymorphisms of coagulation factors II/prothrombin (G20210A) and V (G1691A). RESULTS: The 4G/4G variant of PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism shows a higher
prevalence of International Germ Cell Cancer Classification (IGCCC) poor prognosis compared with 4G/5G and 5G/
5G (24% vs 8% and 15%; chi-square P ¼ .003). In addition, the 4G/4G variant shows reduced TC-related survival with
a hazard ratio of 2.69 (95% CI, 1.26-5.73; P ¼ .010) for TC-related death (adjusted for IGCCC). This is related to an
increased risk for refractory disease and early relapses (odds ratio, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.48-7.59; P ¼ .004). PAI-1 4G/5G
polymorphism is not associated with VTE and CHD risk. CONCLUSIONS: The 4G/4G variant of PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism may be an unfavorable prognostic as well as predictive factor for response to chemotherapy in TC patients. If
confirmed, it may contribute to the identification of patients with increased risk for refractory disease. Cancer

KEYWORDS: testicular cancer, PAI-1, gene polymorphism, survival, vascular toxicity.

The introduction of cisplatin for the treatment of disseminated testicular cancer (TC) in the late 1970s and subsequent

development of cisplatin-based regimens have led to considerable improvement in survival.1,2 Current, long-term survival
rates for this most common malignancy in adult young men exceed 80%.3
With improved survival, long-term treatment-related toxicity has emerged. Together with secondary malignancies,
cardiovascular disease is one of the most important treatment-related risks in TC survivors, threatening life expectancy
and quality of life.4-6 Chemotherapy-related vascular toxicity can occur as an acute as well as a long-term complication.
During chemotherapy cardiovascular complications have been observed as venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial
disease.7-9 With longer follow-up, an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) appears to prevail.5,10,11
Attention is increasingly drawn to designing chemotherapy regimens that will improve prognosis for patients with
unfavorable risk features as well as reduce chemotherapy-related toxicity.12-15 For both purposes, exploratory analyses of
germline polymorphisms that influence chemotherapy efficacy and/or toxicity by involvement in metabolism and/or

target pathways of cytotoxic drugs may contribute. We
selected as gene of interest the gene for Plasminogen-Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI-1).
PAI-1 is a major inhibitor of the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)/uPA receptor (uPAR) pathway, which
is increasingly associated with tumor growth, invasion, and
metastasis.16,17 High expression of uPA and uPAR by
tumors is related to poor prognosis in several cancer
types.17,18 Although PAI-1 might initially be expected to
have an opposite effect to uPA, high expression of PAI-1
by tumors has been associated with poor prognosis.17
Moreover, PAI-1 is the most important circulating
inhibitor of intravascular fibrinolysis. Binding of PAI-1
to the active site of endothelial-derived tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) inhibits the conversion of plasminogen to the active protease plasmin and the
subsequent plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin.19,20
Elevated PAI-1 plasma levels may contribute to the development of thrombosis and have been associated with
both VTE and CHD.21-24
The PAI-1 gene promoter contains at -675 bp a
common, single base pair deletion/insertion polymorphism, the 4G/5G polymorphism (PAI-1 -675 4G/5G,
rs1799889).25 The 5G allele creates an additional binding
site for a transcription inhibitor, which may lead to differences in PAI-1 expression.25,26 The 4G allele has been
associated with higher plasma PAI-1 levels, and with VTE
and CHD.26-28 However, studies on the association of the
PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism with prognosis in different
cancer types are inconclusive.17 So far, it is unknown
whether PAI-1 expression and the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism are related to prognosis and survival in TC.
We investigated whether the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism is associated with differences in survival and
incidence of chemotherapy-related cardiovascular disease
in non-seminomatous TC patients treated with platinumbased chemotherapy. For the analysis of cardiovascular
disease, the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism was combined
with the less common, but potentially confounding, prothrombotic gene polymorphisms of coagulation factors:
factor II/prothrombin (G20210A, rs1799963) and factor
V (G1691A, also known as factor V Leiden, rs6025).29,30

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients with non-seminomatous TC, who were treated
with platinum-based chemotherapy at the University Medical Center Groningen between January 1977 and April

2004, were eligible. Patients with an extragonadal tumor
were excluded. Data were collected on baseline characteristics, disease characteristics (International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCC) prognosis group, dissemination
pattern, and tumor marker levels), chemotherapy regimen,
disease outcome, cardiovascular risk factors, and development of cardiovascular disease (VTE and CHD).
DNA Collection and Genotyping
After informed consent, germline DNA was isolated
from EDTAblood collected at the general practitioner’s
or at the outpatient clinic. For the patients who died,
DNA was isolated from routinely stored serum. Serumderived DNA was amplified and quality checked
(REPLI-g Service; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Samples
deemed ‘usable’ or ‘highly usable’ were used for genotyping. Genotypes were assessed with an allelic discrimination assay on an ABI Prism7900HT sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems [Life Technologies],
Carlsbad, California). For analysis of the PAI-1 -675
4G/5G polymorphism, a 91 bp DNA fragment was created with a forward primer 50 -GCCAGACAAGGTTG
TTGACACA-30 and a reverse primer 50 -GCCGCCTC
CGATGATACA-30 . The 4G allele was identified with
a 50 -VIC-TCCCCACGTGTCCA-MGB-NFQ probe
and the 5G allele with a 50 -FAM-CTCCCCCACGTG
TC-MGB-NFQ probe (Applied Biosystems). Genotyping of factor II G20210A and factor V G1691A was performed with a validated TaqMan Genotyping Assay
from Applied Biosystems (ID C_8726802_20 and ID
C_11975250_10, respectively).
Assessment of Survival
The last follow-up date, including vital status and, if applicable, date and cause of death, were available from the
medical record or the general practitioner’s files. Survival
time was calculated from start of chemotherapy to death
or last follow-up date. TC-related death was defined as
death due to TC and not to chemotherapy-induced toxicity. As described previously31, disease outcome was classified as refractory disease (persistence of tumor markers
lacto-dehydrogenase (LDH), a-fetoprotein (aFP), and
b-human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG), or renewed
elevation within 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy); early relapse (within 2 years after start of treatment
after an initial, complete response), late relapse (more
than 2 years after start of treatment), or no evidence of disease (complete remission without relapse).

Cardiovascular Toxicity
VTE (deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism)
occurring during chemotherapy was analyzed with adjustment for the potential confounding risk factors age at start
of chemotherapy and IGCCC prognosis.
For analyzing CHD, all patients who experienced a
myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease (proven
by coronary angiography or by treatment with coronary
angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery) during chemotherapy or follow-up were included. CHD before start of
chemotherapy was an exclusion criterion. Data were collected on age and follow-up duration at diagnosis of
CHD, and the presence or development of the following
cardiovascular risk factors: positive family history for cardiovascular disease (a parent or brother/sister with proven coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction,
cardiac death, or cerebrovascular accident before the age
of 60), smoking status, hypercholesterolemia (non-fasting plasma cholesterol levels >6.5 mmol/L at 3 separate time points or use of cholesterol lowering
medication), hypertension (blood pressure systolic >150
mm Hg and/or diastolic >95 mm Hg and/or use of antihypertensive medication), overweight (defined as body
mass index [BMI] >27.8 kg/m2), and diabetes mellitus.

Statistical Methods
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of the genotypes was determined by using the chi-square test. Genotype groups were
compared for patient characteristics, disease characteristics,
and received chemotherapy regimen using the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables, as
appropriate, and the chi-square test for categorical variables.
Overall and TC-related survival were analyzed with
Kaplan-Meier curves and tested with the log-rank test. To
adjust for potential confounding factors, multivariate Cox
regression analysis was performed for TC-related survival
and multiple logistic regression analysis for disease outcome.
The risk for VTE during chemotherapy was analyzed using logistic regression analysis. A Cox proportional
hazard model was used to analyze the effect of the genotypes on CHD risk during chemotherapy and follow-up.
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for
Windows 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

(P > .05). There was no apparent difference in distribution of the potential confounding polymorphisms of factor II and factor V over the PAI-1 genotype groups (chisquare test P > .05). Because none of the patients experienced CHD before start of chemotherapy, association of
PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism with survival and chemotherapy-related cardiovascular disease could be analyzed
in 324 (74%) of the total cohort of 439 patients.
The 3 PAI-1 genotype groups did not differ with
respect to age and received chemotherapy regimen. However, the 4G/4G genotype group contained more patients
with an IGCCC poor prognosis, which appears to be
largely attributable to high bHCG levels (Table 2).
PAI-1 4G/5G Polymorphism and Survival
Of the 324 analyzed patients, 35 (10.8%) died. In 28 of
324 (8.6%) patients TC was the cause of death. Other
causes of death were bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity (n ¼ 1), infectious complications (n ¼ 2), myocardial
infarction (n ¼ 1), ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm
(n ¼ 1), pulmonary emphysema (n ¼ 1), and unknown
cause (n ¼ 1).
The PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism showed an association with overall as well as TC-related survival. Overall
survival was worse for the 4G/4G genotype group, mainly
because of worse TC-related survival within the first years
after chemotherapy (Fig. 1). In the 4G/4G genotype 14
(16.7%) patients died of TC compared with 8 (4.9%) in
the 4G/5G group and 6 (7.9%) in the 5G/5G group (log-

rank test P ¼ .003). TC-related survival was comparable
for the 4G/5G and 5G/5G genotype, suggesting a recessive effect of the 4G allele. In multivariate Cox-regression
analysis, with adjustment for the potential confounding
variables age at start of chemotherapy and IGCCC prognosis group, both prognosis group and PAI-1 4G/5G
polymorphism seemed to be independent predictive factors for TC-related survival. With adjustment for prognosis group, patients with the 4G/4G variant showed an
increased risk for TC-related death with a hazard ratio
(HR) of 2.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-5.73;
P ¼ .010) compared with 4G/5G and 5G/5G variants
combined (Table 3 and Fig. 2).
Although residual confounding by prognosis group
cannot be completely excluded, we performed additional
analyses that showed the unfavorable effect of the 4G/4G
variant on TC-related survival remains. We performed
Cox-regression analysis, stratified for IGCCC prognosis
group. In addition, multivariate Cox-regression analysis
was performed with tumor markers LDH, aFP, and
bHCG as continuous variables and the presence of nonpulmonary visceral metastases as dichotomous variable.
Both analyses showed a comparable, independent, unfavorable effect of the 4G/4G variant: hazard ratio [HR] for
TC-related death 2.66; 95% CI, 1.24-5.66; P ¼ .012 and
HR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.37-6.42; P ¼ .006, respectively.
The unfavorable effect of the 4G/4G variant on TCrelated survival did not show predominance for a particular IGCCC prognosis group, bHCG-producing disease,

(Table 5). When excluding central venous access portrelated deep vein thrombosis of an arm, 1 of 7 (14.3%)

prognosis and factor II G20210A polymorphism were independently associated with an increased risk for VTE.

patients with an intermediate or poor prognosis had an
odds ratio [OR] of 2.66 (95% CI,1.09-6.53; P ¼ .032)
compared with patients with a good prognosis. The presence of the heterozygous variant of factor II G20210A

G20210A polymorphism did not affect CHD risk (heterozygous variant HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 0.26-24.73; P ¼
.416, based on 1 patient with CHD).

Coronary heart disease

CHD was diagnosed in 15 (4.6%) patients after
start of chemotherapy. Median age at CHD diagnosis was
51 years (range, 30-62 years) and median follow-up duration was 15 years (range, 0-28 years). Although the incidence of CHD was relatively higher in the 4G/4G and

DISCUSSION
PAI-1 may have a pleiotropic role in cancer patients. On
the one hand, PAI-1 is increasingly recognized as a
key player in cancer progression as well as a potential
therapeutic target.16-18 Conversely, PAI-1 is a

5633

prothrombotic factor that may contribute to cardiovascular complications. We investigated whether the PAI-1
4G/5G polymorphism, which may influence PAI-1
expression, is associated with survival and chemotherapyrelated cardiovascular disease in non-seminomatous TC
patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.
The current results show that the homozygous 4G/
4G variant of the PAI-1 4G/5G deletion/insertion polymorphism is associated with reduced TC-related survival.
This unfavorable effect of the 4G allele appears to be recessive and at least partially independent from the commonly used prognosis classification (IGCCC). The
increased risk for TC-related death (HR 2.69 (1.265.73)) may be related to an increased risk for refractory
disease. Remarkably, the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism is
also associated with IGCCC prognosis group. Patients
with the 4G/4G variant more often belong to the poor
prognosis group, which suggests more aggressive tumor
behavior.
Available data on PAI-1 and cancer prognosis are
most consistent with respect to expression data. High
expression of PAI-1 in tumor tissue has been associated
with poor prognosis in breast cancer, cervical cancer, and
kidney cancer.32-35 Although the exact mechanism behind
PAI-1’s effect on prognosis is unknown, PAI-1 is increasingly recognized as a multifunctional protein with several
tumor-promoting features, with various effects on cell adhesion, migration, and invasion to roles in apoptosis and
angiogenesis.16,17,36,37
However, studies on the association of the germline
PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism with prognosis are inconclusive.17 The 5G allele contains an additional protein
binding site, which may bind a repressor to the PAI-1 promoter and, thus, lead to reduced PAI-1 transcription.
Consequently, some data suggest the 4G allele is associated with a higher basal transcription of the PAI-1 gene26,
whereas other data suggest an increased transcription in
response to an acute phase stimulus25. Whether the germline PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism affects PAI-1 expression by tumor tissue has not been established. For breast
cancer tissue both an association of the PAI-1 4G/5G
polymorphism with PAI-1 expression38 and a lack of association39 have been described. Moreover, tumor-related
mutations, copy number variants, and epigenetic changes
may influence PAI-1 expression by tumors.
As to how the germline PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism affects tumor characteristics and cancer survival,
study results are also inconclusive. For example, in breast
cancer, results vary from a negative effect of the 4G al-

5634

lele38 to a negative effect of the 5G allele,40 or no effect at
all.39 No data are available on tumor PAI-1 expression
and the effect of germline PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism
in TC patients.
We analyzed germline DNA for the PAI-1 4G/5G
polymorphism in TC patients. It is not known whether
the analyzed PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism is associated
with differences in PAI-1 expression by tumor tissue.
Although expression of PAI-1 by host stromal cells may
be important for invasion by tumor cells and angiogenesis,41 the effect of the polymorphism on PAI-1 expression
by surrounding stromal tissue is also not known. Nevertheless, the common 4G/4G variant of the PAI-1 4G/5G
polymorphism seems to be an unfavorable prognostic factor, in addition to the commonly used IGCCC system.
Due to its association with poor disease outcome, the 4G/
4G variant may represent an unfavorable predictive factor
for response to chemotherapy as well.
Although the current study is an association study
that cannot exclude the effect of linkage disequilibrium
and was performed in a mainly white patient group, it
may function as hypothesis generating. Further research
on the expression and role of the uPA/PAR pathway components and PAI-1 in TC is warranted.
As to the role of PAI-1 as intravascular fibrinolysis inhibitor (tPA pathway), we have not found a significant
effect of the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism on the incidence
of cardiovascular disease during or after chemotherapy.
Analysis of CHD is complicated by the small number of
patients with CHD, the short follow-up duration of
patients with the 4G/4G variant (median, 7 years; range,
0-25 years) compared with 10 years (range, 0-27 years) for
the 4G/5G group, and 12 years (range, 1-28 years) for the
5G/5G group, and the lower attained age in patients with
4G/4G (median age, 38 years; range, 20-65 years of age)
versus 40 years of age (range, 20-73 years) for the 4G/5G
group and 44 years of age (range, 19-70 years) for the 5G/
5G group. Moreover, a considerable number of VTE is
probably related to a central venous access port used for
chemotherapy administration (17 of 26 [65%] VTE).
Since 1998,central venous access ports have been used less
frequently. A larger cohort of TC patients without central
venous access ports is needed to study the effect of gene
polymorphisms on VTE risk. However, treatment with
chemotherapy per se is a risk factor for development of
VTE as well as malignancy,42 known to be associated with
circulating, tumor-derived, tissue factor-bearing microparticles.43 Coagulation activation by these factors, in combination with prothrombotic gene polymorphisms such as

Cancer

factor II G20210A and factor V G1691A, may further
increase the risk for VTE.42 Of the potentially confounding polymorphisms factor II G20210A and factor V
G1691A, the heterozygous variant of factor II G20210A
shows an increased risk for all VTE combined, including
central venous access port related VTE, during chemotherapy. The heterozygous variant of factor V G1691A (factor
V Leiden) shows increased risk for CHD. These observations are in agreement with the established role of these
polymorphisms in VTE and their potential, moderate role
in CHD.28,44 However, the variants of factor II G20210A
polymorphism and factor V G1691A polymorphism occur
at low frequencies and are present in a relatively small fraction of the TC patients experiencing VTE and CHD. In
addition, due to the combination of a low frequency of
polymorphic variants and relatively low VTE and CHD
incidence rates, the power of the current study to assess the
effects of factor II G20210A polymorphism and factor V
G1691A polymorphism on risk for chemotherapy-related
vascular toxicity is low.
In conclusion, we have found an association
between the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism and TC-related
survival, but not with chemotherapy-related cardiovascular toxicity. Because the 4G/4G variant of PAI-1 4G/5G
polymorphism is associated with IGCCC poor prognosis,
reduced TC-related survival, and higher prevalence of refractory disease, it may be an unfavorable prognostic as
well as predictive factor for response to chemotherapy in
TC patients. If the unfavorable effect of the 4G/4G variant can be confirmed, it may help identify patients at
increased risk of not responding to chemotherapy, with
curative intent. Because our observations suggest that
PAI-1 may have a role in the prognosis of TC, future
research entailing the uPA/PAR pathway, PAI-1, and the
PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism may enable fine tuning of
the current prognosis classification system and the development of alternative treatment strategies.
