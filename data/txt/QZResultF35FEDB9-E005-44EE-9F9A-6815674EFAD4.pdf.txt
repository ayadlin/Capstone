BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors often experience joint pain as a side effect of their treatment; qualitative investigations suggest that this arthralgia may cause women to feel that they are aging faster than they should be. To facilitate further study of this experience, the Penn Arthralgia Aging Scale (PAAS) was developed. This report describes the development and
validation of the PAAS in a racially diverse sample of breast cancer survivors suffering from joint pain. METHODS: The items of the scale
were developed from a content analysis of interviews with patients. The scale was pilot-tested, and modifications were made on the basis of patient feedback. Subsequently, 596 breast cancer survivors who endorsed joint pain completed the 8-item PAAS. The factor
structure (with exploratory factor analysis), the internal consistency, and the convergent, divergent, and incremental validity were examined. RESULTS: The resulting scale had a 1-factor structure with strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s a 5 .94) and demonstrated
both convergent and divergent validity: the PAAS was significantly correlated with joint pain severity (rs 5 0.55, P <.01) and had a
small and nonsignificant correlation with actual age (rs 5 –0.07, P 5.10). The PAAS was also found to explain incremental variance in
anxiety, depression, and pain interference outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the PAAS produces reliable and valid
scores that capture perceptions of aging due to arthralgia among breast cancer survivors. With further research, the PAAS may advance
our understanding of how perceptions of aging may affect breast cancer survivors’ emotional, behavioral, and clinical outcomes. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
In 2013, approximately 235,000 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States.1 Aromatase inhibitors (AIs),
which are used as oral adjuvant hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women, have been shown to decrease the recurrence
rate and increase the overall survival rate of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer,2,3 which is the most common type
of breast cancer and constitutes approximately 80% of all cases among menopausal women.4 Unfortunately, AIs often
come with difficult side effects, of which aromatase inhibitor–associated arthralgia (AIAA) is one of the most common.5
For many women, joint pain and stiffness may be too overwhelming to manage. Although options for relieving
AIAA exist (including switching to a different AI, taking a drug holiday, pursuing pharmacological treatment, and/or
starting an exercise regimen6), some women do not benefit from or try these strategies and, therefore, discontinue their
AIs. Examining 437 women on AIs, Chim et al7 found that high levels of joint pain predicted premature discontinuation
of AIs; moreover, in a clinical trial comparing 2 AIs, 24.3% of enrolled women who discontinued their medication cited
musculoskeletal symptoms as the reason.8 Because premature discontinuation has been linked to increased rates of recurrence and mortality,9 it is crucial to understand AI patients’ experience with AIAA.
Qualitative investigations and case studies have revealed that arthralgia experienced while patients are on AIs makes
some breast cancer survivors feel that they are aging faster than they should be.10-12 As one woman succinctly put it, “I feel
like I am 100 years old!”12 For some, the sense of aging caused by their arthralgia contributes to a feeling that time is fleeting and that their health is compromised.10 General self-perceptions of aging (outside the context of joint pain) have been
shown to predict mortality, health behaviors, and physical functioning in longitudinal studies,13-15 and this suggests that
that arthralgia-associated aging perceptions may also be related to behavioral outcomes among AI users and could prove to
be a fruitful target for adherence interventions.

Development and Validation of the PAAS/Brier et al

No effort has yet been made to systematically measure and quantify self-perceptions of aging related to joint
pain. A reliable and valid measure would allow further
study of arthralgia-associated aging perceptions and facilitate investigations of its impact on breast cancer survivors’
well-being, health behaviors, and clinical outcomes. To
address this need, this study describes the development of
the Penn Arthralgia Aging Scale (PAAS) and its validation
in a racially diverse sample of breast cancer survivors suffering from joint pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants

Data for this particular study were drawn from the baseline
assessment of 853 participants in an ongoing longitudinal
study examining genetic determinants of symptom distress
and disease outcomes among postmenopausal women with
hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who had been
prescribed AIs16,17 and consented between November,
2011 and September, 2013. The analysis focused on participants who endorsed joint pain (as demonstrated by a score
of 1 or higher [out of 10] when they were asked to assess
their pain at its worst in the past 7 days), and it excluded
those who had not completed all items of the PAAS
(n 5 58); this left a sample size of 596 for this study.
Research assistants recruited participants from breast
cancer clinics in an academic tertiary care teaching hospital
and a community hospital. The eligibility criteria for the
main study were as follows: 1) female sex; 2) age of 18 years
or older; 3) history of stage I, II, or III breast cancer; 4) current use of a third-generation AI for at least 6 months or
discontinuation of AIs before the full duration of prescribed
therapy; 5) being postmenopausal; 6) completion of primary cancer treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy); and 7) ability to understand written English and
participate in an informed consent process. Before
approaching potential participants at medical appointments, research assistants screened their medical records to
ensure that they met the study’s eligibility criteria. After
providing informed consent, participants completed a selfadministered survey at the breast cancer clinic. All measures
and procedures were approved by the institutional review
board of the University of Pennsylvania.
Measures
PAAS

We developed items in the PAAS by conducting a content
analysis of interviews with 67 breast cancer patients on
AIs who were participating in an acupuncture clinical trial
for joint pain.18 A team of 2 medical oncologists, 2 physiCancer

cal therapists, and 2 oncology nurses reviewed the items
for their face validity. The scale was subsequently pilottested on 12 female breast cancer survivors on AIs who
had arthralgia and were not part of this study. We then
clarified item wording on the basis of patient feedback.
The final version of the PAAS consists of 8 items that ask
patients to consider how their joint pain in the past 7 days
has affected how they feel about their “bodies and states of
mind.” Each item consists of a Likert-type scale ranging
from 0 (not at all) to 4 (completely). Ratings from all
items are added together to create a PAAS total score,
which ranges from 0 to 32. Higher scores indicate more
intense perceptions of arthralgia-associated aging.
Measures to assess convergent and divergent
validity

We expected greater perceptions of aging among those
with more severe joint pain; therefore, the pain intensity
subscale (Cronbach’s a 5 .92) of the Brief Pain Inventory
(BPI) was used to assess the convergent validity of the
PAAS. To demonstrate divergent validity, we expected
this correlation to be significantly greater than the correlation between the PAAS and the patient’s actual age
because the PAAS is intended to reflect psychological perceptions of aging due to joint pain, not the actual passing
of time.
Measures to assess incremental validity

To determine whether the PAAS increases our understanding of patients’ experience beyond existing measures,
the incremental validity of the PAAS for predicting psychological outcomes and pain interference was assessed. It
is well established that chronic pain is associated with
depression and anxiety19,20 and that pain, depression, and
anxiety affect daily functioning.21-23 If the PAAS accounts
for significant variance in depression and anxiety over and
above the effects of pain intensity and predicts the degree
to which pain interferes with daily functioning over and
above the effects of pain intensity, depression, and anxiety, this will further support the importance of the aging
perception construct and the incremental validity of the
scale. Consequently, the Hospital and Anxiety Depression
Scale (HADS)24 and the pain interference scale of the
BPI25 were used. In this sample, the values of Cronbach’s
a for the anxiety, depression, and pain interference subscales were 0.84, 0.83, and 0.94, respectively.
Statistical Analyses

Exploratory factor analysis of the PAAS using a geomin
(oblique) rotation was completed in Mplus (Muthen &
Muthen, 2007). A weighted least squares mean and

variance (WLSMV) adjusted estimator was used because
traditional maximum likelihood estimators can yield biased estimates with ordinal scales such as the PAAS.26 To
determine the number of factors, the Kaiser criterion was
applied, and a scree plot was examined along with factor
loadings and fit indices (the comparative fit index and the
standardized root mean square residual27) for possible solutions (it would have been preferable to use a parallel analysis to determine the number of factors, but such an
analysis is not possible for WLSMV estimation in Mplus).
Nonparametric correlations (Spearman r values) were
calculated to assess convergent and divergent validity.
These correlations were compared with the procedure
developed by Meng et al28 for contrasting correlated correTABLE 1. Patient Demographics and AI Status

lation coefficients. To assess incremental validity, 3 hierarchical regressions were conducted to determine whether
the PAAS predicted incremental variance in anxiety,
depression, and pain interference outcomes. When anxiety
and depression were the dependent variables, pain severity
and age were simultaneously entered into step 1, and the
PAAS was entered into step 2. When pain interference was
the outcome, pain intensity, age, depression, and anxiety
were entered into step 1, and the PAAS was entered into
step 2. All variables except age were transformed to normalize their distribution for regression analyses.
RESULTS
Demographics

The average age of the participants was 64 years (standard
deviation 5 9.8). Whites constituted the majority of the
sample (83.6%), and they were followed by African
Americans (14.9%). Approximately a third of the sample
was engaged in full-time employment, and approximately
two-thirds (61.2%) were married or cohabitating with a
partner (Table 1).
Missing Data

Only participants who had completed all items on the
PAAS were included in this study. No differences were
found in age, marital status, education, employment, or
race between those who had completed the PAAS and
those who left some or all PAAS items blank. Among
those who had complete data for the PAAS, 4 participants
had missing data on other measures (HADS and BPI)
used in the validation analyses. Because no more than
20% of the items on any of these measures were missing,
we conducted mean imputation to calculate total scores
for these cases.
Exploratory Factor Analysis

An examination of the Kaiser criterion and scree plot indicated a 1-factor solution. The model fit was excellent
(comparative fit index 5 0.97, standardized root mean

on the PAAS (Fig. 1). In contrast, the correlation between
the PAAS and actual age was negligible (see Table 3). The
size difference between these correlations was statistically
significant (z 5 11.60, P < .001), and this indicates that
the scale has divergent validity.
All 3 hierarchical regressions demonstrated the significant incremental validity of the PAAS (Table 4): The
PAAS explained an additional 28% of the variance (large
effect) for depression and an additional 7% of the variance
(small effect) for anxiety above and beyond pain intensity
and age. The PAAS also explained an additional 5% of the
variance (small effect) in pain interference above and
beyond depression, anxiety, pain intensity, and age.
Because a few items on the PAAS have content similar to
the pain interference scale (items 2 and 3), the hierarchical
regression was repeated with an abbreviated version of the
PAAS that excluded these items. This did not change the
incremental variance explained by the PAAS (5%,
P < .001). These findings suggest that the PAAS captures
an important and unique construct that is not already captured by measures typically associated with emotional and
functional outcomes.

square residual 5 0.09), and factor loadings for all items
were higher than 0.82. The internal consistency of the
scale was very strong (Cronbach’s a 5 .94). Factor loadings and item-remainder correlations for each item can be
found in Table 2. Item responses showed that a substantial portion of the participants endorsed high levels of
aging perceptions. For example, 20.7% of the respondents
agreed strongly (defined as 3 or 4 on the Likert scale) with
the following statement: “I feel that I have aged many
years in a short period of time.” Approximately 15% of
the respondents strongly endorsed “I feel older than people my age.”
Convergent, Divergent, and Incremental Validity

A large, positive correlation was found between the PAAS
and joint pain intensity (rs 5 0.55, P < .01), and this provided evidence for the convergent validity of the PAAS.
Women who endorsed low levels of joint pain (1-3 on
item 1 of the pain intensity scale of the BPI) scored an average of 4.70 on the PAAS, whereas women with high levels of joint pain (4 or higher) scored an average of 12.13

DISCUSSION
With the input of both patients and providers, the PAAS
was developed to capture perceptions of aging among
breast cancer survivors suffering from joint pain. Results
suggest that the measure has strong psychometric properties and captures a meaningful construct: the PAAS has
excellent internal consistency and, as predicted, correlates strongly with joint pain. In addition, the scale’s divergent validity, as shown by its nonsignificant
association with actual age, further highlights the importance of the PAAS construct by demonstrating that
actual age is not a useful proxy for understanding women’s psychological experience of aging in the context of
cancer survivorship.

The strongest evidence for the measure’s importance
is its incremental validity in explaining emotional and
functional outcomes. The PAAS was able to explain additional variance in depression and anxiety over and above
pain severity. After we controlled for depression, anxiety,
and pain severity, the PAAS was also able to explain additional variance in pain interference. In sum, how women
with joint pain perceive the aging of their bodies can provide unique insights into important aspects of their wellbeing that are not explained by other constructs.
Arthralgia-associated perceptions of aging may also
provide insight into the causal chain that connects joint
pain symptoms to lower AI adherence.7 As findings in this
study suggest, joint pain may lead to higher perceptions of
aging, which in turn may contribute to depression.
Because meta-analytic work has shown that depression
and nonadherence are related,29 higher levels of depression may then ultimately lead to lower AI adherence.
When we consider the high rate of nonadherence and discontinuation of AIs,30,31 this mediation hypothesis is
worth further exploration.
It would also be useful to explore whether aging perceptions affect other health behaviors such as physical activity. Remaining physically active is essential to
optimizing long-term health outcomes among breast cancer survivors,32 and joint pain among women on AIs has
been found to be associated with reduced physical activity.33 Because aging perceptions are related to pain interference, the PAAS may further explain some of the
variation in physical activity levels among women on AIs
and provide guidance on how to design psychological
interventions to increase exercise.
2812

Limitations

This study was cross-sectional, and the test-retest reliability
of the PAAS was not evaluated. It is also unclear whether
the PAAS is sufficiently sensitive to assess changes in
arthralgia-associated aging perceptions over time. The predictive validity of the PAAS was not explored; evidence that
arthralgia-associated perceptions of aging predict changes
in functional outcomes and health behaviors (eg, AI medication adherence and physical activity) would strengthen
support for the scale’s significance. Furthermore, because
of the high internal consistency of the PAAS (>0.90), it is
possible that some items are redundant, and a shorter version may be used if so desired.34 Lastly, because this instrument was validated among breast cancer survivors, it is
unclear how generalizable these findings are to other populations experiencing joint pain.
In conclusion, these findings suggest that breast cancer survivors with higher levels of joint pain are more
likely to carry negative beliefs about how their joint pain
has affected their aging process. These beliefs may lead to
impaired well-being that cannot be explained by pain intensity alone. To our knowledge, the PAAS is the first reliable and valid instrument to quantitatively assess these
beliefs. With this scale, observational studies can be conducted to define the temporal relationship between this
psychological experience and important health behaviors
such as adherence and physical activity among breast cancer survivors. Subsequently, intervention studies can be
developed that target arthralgia-associated aging perceptions by using approaches such as cognitive-behavioral
restructuring, mindfulness, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Ultimately, by providing interventions that

effectively address the psychological experience of aging
due to joint pain, we can potentially improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with breast cancer.
