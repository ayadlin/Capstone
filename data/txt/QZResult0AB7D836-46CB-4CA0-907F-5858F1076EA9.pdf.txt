Abstract
The identification of target genes is a key step for assessing the
role of aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNA) in human
cancer and for the further development of miRNA-based gene
therapy. MiR-122 is a liver-specific miRNA accounting for 70%
of the total miRNA population. Its down-regulation is a
common feature of both human and mouse hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). We have previously shown that miR-122 can
regulate the expression of cyclin G1, whose high levels have
been reported in several human cancers. We evaluated the
role of miR-122 and cyclin G1 expression in hepatocarcinogenesis and in response to treatment with doxorubicin and
their relevance on survival and time to recurrence (TTR) of
HCC patients. We proved that, by modulating cyclin G1, miR122 influences p53 protein stability and transcriptional
activity and reduces invasion capability of HCC-derived cell
lines. In addition, in a therapeutic perspective, we assayed the
effects of a restored miR-122 expression in triggering
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and we proved that miR-122,
as well as cyclin G1 silencing, increases sensitivity to
doxorubicin challenge. In patients resected for HCC, lower
miR-122 levels were associated with a shorter TTR, whereas
higher cyclin G1 expression was related to a lower survival,
suggesting that miR-122 might represent an effective molecular target for HCC. Our findings establish a basis toward the
development of combined chemo- and miRNA-based therapy
for HCC treatment. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5761–7]

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 80% to 90% of
primary liver cancers, and it is the third cause of death from cancer
worldwide. Nowadays, the curative treatments for HCC detected at
an early stage include surgical resection, liver transplantation, and
percutaneous ablation (1). Although the diffusion of surveillance
programs of cirrhotic patients has led to an increased detection of
HCC at an early stage, most patients are diagnosed at intermediateadvanced stages, when the only proven options available to improve
survival are transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and molecu-

larly targeted therapy with the multikinase inhibitor, Sorafenib. In
particular, TACE is an effective treatment increasing the survival rate
of selected patients with intermediate stage HCC, and to improve its
efficacy, new therapeutic approaches with enhanced antitumoral
effect and reduced toxicity, such as doxorubicin-drug eluiting beads
and radiating agents, have been investigated. Doxorubicin is the most
used traditional chemotherapeutic drug for HCC, either by systemic
delivery or by means of TACE. In addition, surgical resection and
percutaneous ablation display a recurrence rate approaching 70% at
5 years (1), opening the path to secondary prevention. Despite recent
advancements, new more effective therapeutic approaches are
urgently needed. Our improved understanding of the molecular basis
of cancer has identified targets for molecular-based therapy. In this
context, the discovery of the central role of microRNAs (miRNA) in
human tumorigenesis has opened a new field that may be relevant not
only for understanding cancer at the molecular level but also for the
development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
miRNAs are a class of endogenous phylogenetically conserved
small RNAs (f22 nucleotides) responsible for the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA translation and stability. miRNAs are
involved in several biological processes, such as development,
apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. Aberrant expression of
numerous miRNAs has been associated with cancer development
(2), and deregulated miRNAs have been linked to molecular
pathways involved in neoplastic transformation (3).
Altered expression of miRNAs and the identification of their
molecular target genes in HCC have previously been described by
ours and other groups (4–6). Therefore, taking advantage of
promising in vivo studies on miRNAs (7, 8), this class of molecules
may represent a new kind of unconventional targeted treatment to
be eventually associated with traditional approaches for HCC not
amenable of curative therapies.
We previously reported that cyclin G1 is a gene target of the
liver-specific miRNA miR-122. MiR-122 is down-regulated in f70%
of HCCs (4, 9), and an inverse correlation links miR-122 to cyclin
G1 in HCC tissues and HCC-derived cell lines.
Cyclin G1 was initially discovered as a novel member of cyclin
family with homology to c-src, and successively, it was identified as
a transcriptional target of p53 tumor suppressor protein (10).
Cyclin G1 is the only known cyclin that is transcriptionally
activated by p53 tumor suppressor gene, bearing two functional
binding sites for this transcription factor (11). Moreover, cyclin G1
exerts a negative feedback regulation on p53 tumor suppressor
protein by recruiting the B’ subunit of phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to
dephosphorylate Mdm-2 (12).
The precise role of cyclin G1 on cellular growth control is still
controversial. Some reports, based on the observation that cyclin

G1 overexpression enhances cell growth of cancers cells (13) and
its silencing suppresses cell proliferation (14), indicate a promoting
growth activity for cyclin G1. In line with these data, cyclin G1
overexpression has been found in human tumors, such as
osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and leiomioma (15–17). Conversely,
the induction of cyclin G1 after DNA damage and its role in G2-M
arrest suggest a possible growth inhibitory activity (18, 19). A
recent study indicated that the growth inhibitory activity of cyclin
G1 is dependent on the magnitude of its expression (20).
The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of
reduced miR-122 expression to hepatocarcinogenesis and the
response to doxorubicin treatment. To this end, we proved that
miR-122 enforced expression, as well as cyclin G1 silencing, leads to
increased p53 protein stability and transcriptional activity and
reduced invasion capability of HCC-derived cell lines. Finally, in a
therapeutic perspective, we assayed the effects of a restored miR-122
expression in triggering apoptosis after doxorubicin challenge.

Materials and Methods

Figure 1. MiR-122 and cyclin G1 expression in HCC-derived cell lines and HCC
samples. A, real-time RT-PCR analysis of miR-122 in transfected cells, normal
liver, HCC, and LC samples. miRNA levels in miR-122–transfected HepG2
cells were compared with those of normal liver (5.5 versus 4.7, respectively),
whereas negative control-transfected HepG2 cells displayed undetectable
miR-122 levels. miRNA silencing in Huh-7 cells lead to a 3.2-fold reduction of
miR-122 compared with negative control. MiR-122 expression of two matched
HCC and LC samples (Supplementary Table S1; serial nos. 24 and 1) have
been reported. HCC and LC pools refer to a pool of four HCC samples and a pool
of four LC samples (Supplementary Table S1; serial nos. 5, 21, 38, and 56).
Analysis of miR-122 expression was carried out using the cycle threshold (C t)
method with U6RNA as endogenous control. A pool of three LC samples was
used as reference sample for the DDC t method. 2( DDC t) value is reported in
the y coordinate in a linear scale. Each sample was run in triplicate. B, WB
analysis of cyclin G1 in HCC-derived cells. h-Actin was used as house-keeping
gene, and relative expression of cyclin G1 is reported.

Patients. HCC and cirrhotic tissues were obtained from 57 consecutive
patients (43 males and 14 females, median age 68 y, range 49-82 y)
undergoing liver resection for HCC at University of Bologna Department of
Surgery. Tissue samples were collected at surgery and stored as previously
described (4). Informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Histopathologic grading was scored according to Edmondson and Steiner’s
criteria (21). Exclusion criteria were a previous history of local or systemic
treatments for HCC and the presence of noncirrhotic tissue surrounding the
HCC nodule/s. The characteristics of HCC patients included in this study
are described in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell culture. HepG2 (ATCC no. HB-8065) cell line was cultured with
MEM (Eagle), whereas Huh-7 cell line was cultured with RPMI 1640; both
media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.
Cell transfection with RNA oligonucleotides. HCC-derived cell lines
were transfected with 100 nmol/L of miR-122, Negative Control #1
precursor and inhibitor miRNAs (Ambion), anti–miR-122 (Dharmacon) or
40 nmol/L of cyclin G1 small interfering RNAs (siRNA), G1/238 (5¶-TGG CCT
CAG AAT GAC TGC AAG ACT A-3¶) and G1/832 (5¶-GCA AGA GCT TGT

of cyclin G1 mRNA was observed with both siRNAs. D, WB analysis of cyclin G1 and p53 expression in G1/832 siRNA-transfected HepG2 cells. A 1.5-fold
decrease of cyclin G1 and a 1.4-fold increase of p53 protein were observed in cyclin G1-siRNA–transfected cells. h-actin was used as house-keeping gene for both
protein and mRNA normalization.

ATC CAA ATG TTT A-3¶), validated p53 siRNAs pool, and Stealth RNA
Negative Control by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The silencing of
PPP2R5B gene was obtained by using 10 nmol/L of a pool of three siRNAs
against PPP2R5B mRNA (TriFECTa Dicer-Substrate RNAi kit,
HSC.RNAI.N006244.9, IDT). At 48 h after transfection, treated cells were
harvested for Western blot (WB), reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR), and
flow cytometry (FC) analysis using the FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences).
Real-time RT-PCR analysis of miR-122. Quantitation of miR-122 was
obtained using Taqman miRNA assays (hsa-miR-122, N/P: 4373151, Applied
Biosystems), as previously described (4). To normalize the expression levels
of miR-122, Taqman endogenous control (RNU6B, N/P: 4373381, Applied
Biosystems) was used.
WB analysis. Transfected HCC-derived cell lines, as well as primary HCC
tissues, were assayed with anti-cyclin G1 (clone F-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies (clone DO-7, Dakocytomation), anti–
phosphorylated p53 polyclonal antibody (Ser-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti–p21 monoclonal antibody (clone SX118, Dakocytomation), anti–h-actin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti–cleaved caspase-3, and Puma polyclonal
antibodies (Cell Signaling). Anti–PPP2R5B polyclonal antibody was from
ABR. Digital images of autoradiographies were acquired with Fluor-S
MultiImager (Quantity-one, Bio-Rad), as previously reported (5).
p53 luciferase reporter assay. p53 activity was investigated by
luciferase assay. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with 500 ng of the
luciferase reporter vector (pp53-TA-luc, Clontech) and 100 nmol/L of miR122 or 40 nmol/L of cyclin G1 siRNA or negative controls. A pTA-Luc vector
was used as a control vector. A Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-TK, Promega)
was used to normalize differences in transfection efficiency in each well.
In vitro invasion assay in Matrigel. HepG2 cells were seeded in six-well
plates at a concentration of 2.5  105 per well and transfected with miR-122
or cyclin G1 siRNA as above reported. Forty-eight hours after transfection
cells were collected and tested for their invasive potential by chemoinvasion
assay into Matrigel, as described by Albini (22).
Semiquantitative RT-PCR. Semiquantitative PCR was performed using
primers and conditions detailed in Supplementary Table S2.
Cell cycle analysis. At 48 h after transfection, miR-122 and cyclin G1
siRNA-transfected cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4jC for
16 h. FC analysis was performed as previously described (5).
FC-Annexin V assay. At 24 h after oligonucleotide transfection, HepG2
and Huh-7 cell lines were treated with doxorubicin for further 24 h and then
collected for WB and FC analysis. Detection of apoptotic cells after
doxorubicin treatment was performed by using Annexin V/propidium
iodide detection kit (Bender MedSystems) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and analyzed by FC.
Statistical analysis. Differences between groups were analyzed using
conventional Student’s t test or ANOVA. Pearson’s correlation coefficient
was used to explore the relationship between miR-122 or cyclin G1
expression on one side and AFP serum levels, tumor size, grade, etiology,
and focality on the other side. Patient survival and time-to-recurrence (TTR)
curves based on different miR-122 or cyclin G1 levels were computed by
Kaplan-Meyer product-limit method and compared using a log-rank test.
Reported P values were two sided and considered significant at <0.05.
Statistical calculations were executed using SPSS version 8.0 (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
MiR-122 regulates p53 protein expression through cyclin G1
in HCC-derived cells. Cyclin G1, a target of miR-122, negatively
regulates p53 protein stability by acting on PP2A. Therefore, we
decided to investigate the modulation of p53 protein after
overexpression of miR-122 in HCC-derived cells.
HepG2 cells were chosen for enforcing the expression of miR-122,
because this cell line exhibits undetectable levels of constitutive
miR-122 in the presence of wild-type p53 protein and high levels of
cyclin G1 protein (Fig. 1A and B). At 48 h after transfection, miR-122
expression was assayed by real-time RT-PCR and compared with
that of normal liver, cirrhotic, and HCC tissues (Fig. 1A).

A, WB analysis of phosphorylated p53 (Ser-20) in HepG2 cells transfected
with miR-122, cyclin G1 siRNA (G1/832), or scramble oligonucleotides. An
increase of phosphorylated p53 protein was observed in both miR-122
(5.0-fold) and cyclin G1 siRNA (3.0-fold) transfected cells. h-Actin was used as
house-keeping gene. B, HepG2 cells were transfected with pp53-TA-luc or
pTA-luc together with pRL-tk vector in the presence of miR-122, G1/832 siRNA, or
negative controls. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after cotransfection.
Results from the dual-luciferase assay are presented as the ratio of
luciferase activity in pp53-TA-luc–transfected to pTA-luc–transfected cells.
An increase (P < 0.01; t test) of the luciferase activity was observed in
miR-122–overexpressing and cyclin G1–silenced cells (2.6-fold and 1.5-fold,
respectively). Columns, average values of two independent experiments; bars,
SD. C, RT-PCR analysis of p53 transcriptional targets, Bax and Puma, in HepG2
cells transfected with miR-122 or cyclin G1 siRNA. An increase of both targets
was observed in treated cells. h-Actin has been used as house-keeping gene.

Conversely, miR-122 silencing was performed in Huh-7 cells because
this is the only HCC-derived cell line that exhibits miR-122 constitutive
expression (23) associated with low cyclin G1 levels (Fig. 1A and B).
Besides, Huh-7 cells harbor a mutant isoform of p53 protein, as it
occurs in f30% of HCCs (24). A reduction of miR-122 levels was
observed in Huh-7 cells after anti–miR-122 transfection (Fig. 1A).
By WB analysis, miR-122–overexpressing HepG2 cells showed a
decreased cyclin G1 expression, accompanied by an increase of p53
protein (Fig. 2A). Conversely, anti–miR-122 transfected Huh-7 cells
showed an increase in cyclin G1 expression (Fig. 2B). p53 protein
levels were not analyzed because Huh-7 cells harbor a p53 mutant
isoform with nuclear accumulation.
To verify that cyclin G1 was responsible for p53 modulation after
miR-122 transfection, cyclin G1 knockdown in HepG2 cells was
obtained with two siRNAs (G1/238 and G1/832). Figure 2C shows a
decrease in cyclin G1 mRNA after siRNAs transfection. Silencing of
cyclin G1 by siRNAs ruled out an off-target effect. G1/832 siRNA was
chosen because it proved to be the most effective. Immunoblotting
analysis of cyclin G1–silenced HepG2 cells revealed a decrease of

the number of invading cells was observed in miR-122 and cyclin G1 siRNA-transfected cells (1.6-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively; P = 0.006 and P = 0.04; t test).
Four independent fields have been considered for the counting of invading cells. Columns, average values; bars, SD. D, WB analysis of E-cadherin protein in

(1.3-fold)–transfected cells. RT-PCR analysis of E-cadherin in HepG2 cells transfected with miR-122 or cyclin G1-siRNA. No change of E-cadherin mRNA levels
was observed in miR-122 or cyclin G1-siRNA–transfected cells. h-Actin was used as house-keeping gene for both protein and mRNA normalization.

cyclin G1 levels and an increase of p53 corresponding band (Fig. 2D).
As a further confirmation, an increase of p53 protein was observed in
HepG2 cells stably knocked down for cyclin G1 (Supplementary Fig.
S1C). Taken together, these data suggested that miR-122 indirectly
affects p53 expression through the modulation of cyclin G1.
MiR-122 overexpression and cyclin G1 silencing increase p53
transcriptional activity. Because the phosphorylation of p53 at
Ser-20 modulates the interaction with Mdm-2 protein, increasing
p53 half-life and its transcriptional activity (25), we assessed the
effect of miR-122 and cyclin G1 on phosphorylated p53. WB analysis
showed an increase of phosphorylated Ser levels in either miR-122–
overexpressing or cyclin G1–silenced HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A).
To assess the role of miR-122 or cyclin G1 on transcriptional
activity of p53, we measured the luciferase activity of a reporter
vector containing a p53-responsive element (pp53-TA-luc) after
transfection of miR-122 or cyclin G1 siRNAs in HepG2 cells. An
increase of luciferase activity was observed in both miR-122–
overexpressing and cyclin G1–silenced cells (Fig. 3B).
To confirm the increase of p53 transcriptional activity in miR122–overexpressing and cyclin G1–silenced cells, Bax and Puma
mRNA expression was evaluated as p53 transcriptional targets. As
shown in Fig. 3C, both p53 targets increased after enforced miR-122
expression or cyclin G1 silencing. Altogether, these findings
indicate that miR-122 increases p53 transcriptional activity, at
least in part through the regulation of cyclin G1.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

MiR-122 and cyclin G1 affect cell cycle and cell invasion of HepG2
cells. After miR-122 overexpression or cyclin G1 silencing, HepG2 cells
displayed a decreased growth rate and a change in morphology,
showing a more adherent pattern with cytoplasmic protrusions. These
observations suggest that siRNA or miRNA-mediated knockdown of
cyclin G1 affects phenotypic properties of HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A).
We assayed cell distribution through the different phases of the
cell cycle by FC analysis. We observed an increase in the G1-phase
population and a corresponding decrease in the G2-M phase
in both miR-122–overexpressing and cyclin G1–silenced cells
(Fig. 4B). The decrease of cells in the G2-M phase was previously
reported as a response to cyclin G1 knockdown (19).
To further define the effects of miR-122 and cyclin G1 in HCCderived cells, the invasion capability was assayed after enforced miR122 expression or cyclin G1 knockdown. Matrigel assay revealed a
decreased number of invading cells in both conditions (Fig. 4C),
suggesting a role of miR-122 both in cell cycle modulation and
invasion. After miR-122 overexpression or cyclin G1 knockdown,
increased E-cadherin (26) expression without any mRNA modulation was observed. Conversely, the analysis of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) by zymography did not reveal any change in
MMP-2 or MMP-9 activities in transfected cells (data not shown).
Short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) stable knockdown of cyclin G1
performed in HepG2 cells confirmed the findings obtained with
transient transfection (Supplementary Fig. S1).

MiR-122 Sensibilizes Cells to Doxorubicin

MiR-122 overexpression and cyclin G1 silencing increase
doxorubicin sensitivity of HCC-derived cell lines. After
restoration of miR-122 expression or cyclin G1 silencing in HepG2
cells, we did not observe any increase in cell death. However,
because cyclin G1 is activated in response to DNA damage (19, 27),
we assayed whether miR-122 overexpression or cyclin G1 silencing
could affect cell sensitivity to doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is the most
used drug for intermediate-advanced HCCs. Because doxorubicin
induces apoptosis through both a p53-dependent and p53independent manner (28), we assayed both HepG2 and Huh-7
cells, which differ in p53 status and miR-122 expression.
HepG2 cells were transfected with miR-122 or cyclin G1 siRNA
and then treated with doxorubicin. At 24 h after treatment, FC
analysis for Annexin V revealed an increase of apoptotic cells in
miR-122–overexpressing and cyclin G1–silenced cells (Fig. 5A). As a
further proof, an increase of the cleaved caspase-3 in miR-122

transfected cells and cyclin G1 knockdown cells was observed
compared with doxorubicin only–treated HepG2 cells. Moreover,
the p53 transcriptional target Puma increased in miR-122 and
cyclin G1 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5B).
Because Huh-7 cells display detectable levels of miR-122, this
cells were used for investigating the effect of anti–miR-122 on
doxorubicin challenge. Doxorubicin treatment in miR-122–silenced
Huh-7 cells determined a decrease of apoptotic cells. Whereas,
similarly to what was observed in HepG2 cells, cyclin G1 silencing
led to an increased susceptibility of Huh-7 cells to doxorubicin
challenge (Fig. 5C). These data showed that miR-122 increases
sensitivity of HCC cells to doxorubicin through both p53dependent and p53-independent apoptotic pathways.
Correlation of miR-122 and cyclin G1 with clinicopathologic
variables. We analyzed the expression of miR-122 by real-time RTPCR in 57 surgically resected HCCs and matched nontumorous
liver tissues (liver cirrhosis, LC). Due to tissue availability, the
expression of cyclin G1 was investigated in 35 of 57 HCCs and
matched LC by both WB and immunohistochemistry, with the
latter technique adopted in few cases to confirm the cellular
localization of cyclin G1. Low miR-122 expression was associated
with a shorter TTR (Fig. 6A), whereas it did not achieve a statistical
significance for the overall survival (Fig. 6B). Conversely, low levels
of cyclin G1 turned out to be associated with a higher survival rate,
but not with TTR (Fig. 6C and D). No correlations were found
between miR-122 or cyclin G1 expression and a-fetoprotein (AFP),
size, focality, etiology, and histopathologic grading of HCCs.

cells (1.3-fold, P = 0.05; t test) was displayed after cyclin G1 silencing. A and

MiR-122 is a liver-specific miRNA representing f70% of the liver
miRNA population, and it has been characterized for its multiple
roles in liver physiology, metabolism (7, 29), and modulation of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (23). Notably, its loss or downregulation has been associated with human and rodent HCC
development and progression (4, 9). In this study, we investigated a
mechanism through which the down-regulation of miR-122 might
contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis and doxorubicin challenge. Trying
to uncover the pro-oncogenic events after the reduction of miR-122
physiologic levels, we showed that both miR-122 overexpression or
siRNA-mediated silencing of its target cyclin G1 determined an increase of p53 transcriptional activity and stability, indicating that
miR-122 could modulate p53 through the inhibition of cyclin G1.
The oncogenic role of cyclin G1 is well documented, and
its overexpression has been reported in different human tumors
(14–16, 30). Moreover, it has been previously shown that cyclin G1–
null mice treated with a potent hepatocarcinogen, N-diethylnitrosamine, display a lower tumor incidence, likely due to an increased
p53 activity (31). Here, we observed that shRNA-mediated silencing
of cyclin G1 modifies the cell phenotype, resulting in morphologic
changes, inhibition of cell growth, decreased cell invasion
capability, and reduced AFP secretion (Supplementary Fig. S1F).
Interestingly, the extent of p53 increase after miR-122 restored
expression was slightly greater than that caused by direct cyclin G1
silencing. This suggests that miR-122 transfection affects the
expression of more than one molecular target belonging to the p53dependent pathway. Indeed, a bioinformatic analysis (by MiRANDA
algorithm) indicated the regulatory subunit h’, h-isoform
(PPP2R5B), of PP2A as a hypothetical target of miR-122. It is
known that cyclin G1 associates with the h’-subunit of PP2A,
promoting the dephosphorylation of p53 repressor protein Mdm-2

(12, 32); therefore, a direct regulation of PP2A regulatory subunit by
miR-122 might increase cyclin G1–mediated effect. Supplementary
Fig. S2 showed the increase of p53 levels after both siRNA-mediated
PPP2R5B silencing or miR-122–enhanced expression. These findings confirm that both miR-122–mediated inhibition of cyclin G1
and PPP2R5B silencing contribute to the modulation of p53
expression. Further studies are warranted to elucidate molecular
mechanisms through which miR-122 might regulate PPP2R5B
expression. Moreover, PDGF1A and Met are both putative targets of
miR-122, as predicted by MiRANDA algorithm, suggesting that
miR-122 might affect multiple invasion pathways.
The analysis of primary HCC samples did not show any
relationship between miR-122 or cyclin G1 expression and size,
focality, grading, etiology (Supplementary Fig. S3), and AFP serum
levels of HCC patients. Indeed previous studies reported heterogeneous miR-122 expression patterns in different HCC series.
Beside reports showing a down-regulation of miR-122 in HCC
tissue regardless of chronic liver disease etiology (9, 33, 34), other
studies reported an up-regulation of miR-122 in HCV-related HCC
(35) or an up-regulation of miR-122 restricted to HBV-related HCCs
and a down-regulation of miR-122 in metastatic HCCs (36). This
variable miR-122 behavior is not unexpected due to the well-known

molecular heterogeneity of HCC in relation with different liver
carcinogens, viruses, and genetic background.
Interestingly, TTR was shorter in patients with lower miR-122
expression, whereas lower cyclin G1 levels turned out to be
associated with a higher survival rate, suggesting that miR-122 and
its target gene cyclin G1 might influence the clinical course of HCC.
The multiple key cancer-associated functions affected by the
down-regulation of miR-122 in liver cancer cells may also suggest a
potential use of miR-122 in miRNA-based anti-HCC gene therapy.
To start shedding light on the possible advantages offered by miR122 combination treatments, we observed that after doxorubicin
challenge, enforced miR-122 expression or cyclin G1 silencing
increased doxorubicin sensitivity through enhanced apoptotic cell
death. Human HCC covers a heterogeneous group displaying low
miR-122 expression levels and p53 mutations in a considerable
percentage of cases. Therefore, miR-122 silencing was performed in
Huh-7 cells, constitutionally expressing miR-122 and harboring a
mutant p53 isoform. As observed in HepG2 cells, a protection
against doxorubicin-induced cell death was reproduced in this
different molecular setting, thus confirming that miR-122 sensitizes
cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis either through a p53dependent and p53-independent mechanism.

MiR-122 Sensibilizes Cells to Doxorubicin

Differently from our data, Okamoto (37) showed that the
overexpression of cyclin G1 sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli, such
as tumor necrosis factor-a and retinoic acid treatments, in three
nonhepatocytic mouse cell lines. This different behavior could be
attributed to various conditions including higher cyclin G1 levels and/
or activation of different molecular pathways in response to apoptotic
stimuli different from those used in our study. Cyclin G1 might act,
therefore, as oncogene or tumor suppressor gene, depending upon
cellular context and different experimental settings. In addition, the
pathways of cyclin G1 activation seem to be cell or context dependent.
Indeed, we observed that cyclin G1 is regulated in a p53-independent
manner in HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
In human and rodent HCCs, a reduction of miR-122 expression
represents a common feature. Therefore, the reconstitution of downregulated miRNAs offers the theoretical possibility to modulate
malignant phenotypes by targeting more than one molecule and
represents a very promising tool for cancer gene therapy (38).
Other than increasing p53 activity by inhibition of cyclin G1
through siRNA, it is possible to envisage therapies based on miR-122
administration. Indeed, targeting the liver with siRNAs, molecules
similar to miRNAs, was reported to be safe and effective at therapeutic doses. Moreover, the liver represents an ideal organ for
oligonucleotide-based therapies because it is extremely receptive in
the uptake of peripherally given oligonucleotides. In addition,
efficient ways for the selective drug delivery in HCC feeding arteries
have been developed and routinely used in the clinical practice.

Concerning miR-122–based therapies in HCV-related liver
diseases, attention should be given to the effects on HCV
replication, although a recent report has outlined both the lack
of correlation between miR-122 levels and viral load and the
association between low tissue levels of miR-122 and the absence of
a virological response during interferon treatment (39).
In conclusion, this study shows that miR-122, through down-regulation of cyclin G1, can trigger apoptosis and increase sensitivity of
HCC-derived cells to doxorubicin, hence providing the biological basis
toward the development of combined chemo- and miRNA-based
therapy. The effect on TTR and survival by miR-122 and its target,
cyclin G1, further supports their possible use in a clinical setting.
