Conditional Deletion of the Focal Adhesion Kinase FAK
Alters Remodeling of the Blood–Brain Barrier in Glioma
Jisook Lee, Alexandra K. Borboa, Hyun Bae Chun, Andrew Baird, and Brian P. Eliceiri

Abstract
Gliomas generally infiltrate the surrounding normal brain parenchyma, a process associated with increased
vascular permeability (VP) and dysregulation of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying glioma-induced VP in the brain remain poorly understood. Using a conditional,
endothelium-specific deletion of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the mouse (FAK CKO), we show that
FAK is critical for destabilization of the tumor endothelium in tumor-bearing mice, with mutant mice exhibiting
a relatively normalized vasculature compared with wild-type mice (FAK WT). Tumor vessels in the FAK CKO
mice displayed reduced VP compared with FAK WT mice, resulting in reduced tumor growth. Additionally, FAK
CKO mice displayed partial restoration of cell–cell junction proteins in the tumor vessels and astrocyte–
endothelium interactions in tumors, revealing an additional role of astrocytes in mediating tumor-induced VP.
Together, these results provide genetic evidence that FAK is a mediator of tumor-induced VP in the brain. Our
findings may help understand how therapeutics might be used to regulate specific cell-type interactions to
restore BBB structure/function in cancer and perhaps other pathologic conditions. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10131–40.

Introduction
In the normal brain, many different cell types interact with
each other to maintain a tight barrier between the blood and
brain parenchyma, which is also known as the blood–brain
barrier (BBB), which consists of tight interendothelial cell
junctions, surrounded by astrocyte end feet and separated by a
basal lamina. The integrity of normal BBB is compromised in
pathologic conditions, such as that occurs in the growth and
progression of malignant glioma (1). Several studies have
shown that gliomas alter specific cell-type interactions, leading to dysregulation of the BBB (i.e., BBB breakdown), which in
turn lead to an increase in vascular permeability (VP; refs. 2, 3).
For example, our previous studies have shown that gliomas
induce remodeling of the BBB in a specific cell-type manner
(4) and that alterations of specific host components regulate
tumor-mediated VP and tumor invasion (3, 5).
To identify more selective mediators of the BBB in terms
of function and cell type, we have focused on the role of a key
downstream target of Src, FAK (6), in normal adult brain and
tumor-bearing brain. FAK is enriched in brain blood vessels

compared with surrounding cell types, phosphorylated in
response to VEGF (7–11), and forms signaling complexes
with Src and integrins in VEGF-induced signaling (8, 12, 13).
Standard knockout approaches have determined that FAKdeleted embryos have severely impaired blood vessel development (14, 15). Subsequent endothelial cell–specific deletion of FAK also led to an embryonic lethal phenotype,
indicating a functional role for FAK in the development
of the vascular endothelium in particular (14, 16–18). More
recently, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (PYK2) has been shown
to have a compensatory role for FAK (19), whereas a differential role of kinase-independent and -dependent functions
of FAK in vascular development of embryogenesis has been
reported (20, 21). Clearly, there remains a need to better
understand specific cell- and tissue-type mechanisms regulating vascular integrity, and the FAK conditional knockout
mouse is one such model to define the functional relevance
of FAK in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Mice
FAK deletion in adult endothelia was achieved by tamoxifen
administration to FAKflox/flox mice, a kind gift from Dr. H.
Beggs (22), crossed with Tie2-Cre/ERT2 (tamoxifen-inducible
Cre activation under the control of endothelium-specific Tie2
promoter) mice, a kind gift from Dr. J. Esko (23), and backcrossed into Rag2/, immunodeficient background (FAK
CKO). Littermates that were null for Cre gene were used as
controls wild-type mice (FAK WT). Ten-week-old FAK CKO
and FAK WT mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2-mg

tamoxifen (Sigma) for 5 consecutive days to induce recombination. All animal handling procedures were approved by the
University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Glioma tumor cells
Early passages of patient-derived human glioma cells,
DBTRG, a kind gift from Dr. C. Kruse (24), were used for
xenograft studies. DBTRG cells transduced with lentivirusexpressing firefly luciferase (DBTRG-luc) or red fluorescent
protein (DBTRG-RFP) were generated as described earlier (4).
In vivo bioluminescent imaging
Fur was removed from mice with electric clippers and Nair
(Church & Dwight Co.) before imaging at each time point.
Bioluminescent signals were assessed 10 minutes after Dluciferin injection (at the steady state of luminescent signal),
using a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Spectrum; Caliper Life Sciences) capable of in vivo imaging. Tumor
growth was monitored by quantitation of light emission from
a region of interest drawn over the tumor region at each time
point (unit ¼ radiance). Images were analyzed using Living
Image software version 3.1 (Caliper Life Sciences).
Biochemical analyses in isolated endothelial cells
Mouse brain microvessels were isolated from tamoxifentreated FAK WT and FAK CKO mice, based on previously
published protocols (25–28). Mice were injected with 1 mg of
FITC-lectin (FL 1101-5; Vector Labs) 20 minutes prior to
sacrifice to validate the integrity of isolated vessels. Genomic
DNA was purified from isolated microvessels (Qiagen) and
used as templates for PCR analysis as described earlier (29).
The following antibodies were used to validate downregulation
of FAK in isolated microvessels preps; anti-FAK (C-20, BD
Transduction Laboratories; 1:1,000), anti-b-actin (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:500), anti-Synaptophysin (Abcam; 1:1,000),
anti-AQ4 (Millipore; 1:500), anti-P-glycoprotein (Abcam; 1:250).
Vascular permeability assay
Mice were injected with FITC-dextran 70 kDa (Sigma), and
20 minutes later mice were subjected to systemic intracardiac
perfusion with 1 USP unit/mL of heparin dissolved in saline.
One-millimeter thick brain sections were imaged to measure
vascular permeability (FITC) and tumor burden (RFP) with a
deep-cooled CCD imaging system equipped with appropriate
fluorescence filter cubes with background subtraction and
images were analyzed using Living Image software version 3.1
(Lumina; Caliper Life Sciences).
Immunohistochemistry
Standard immunohistochemistry was done using the following primary antibodies at the following dilutions. Anti-CD31
(553370, BD Biosciences; 1:100), rabbit polyclonal anti-laminin
(L9393, Sigma; 1:1,200), mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP (C9205,

Millipore;1:100), rabbit polyclonal ZO-1 (Zymed; 1:100), rabbit
polyclonal occludin (Invitrogen; 1:100). Alexa-fluor–conjugated
secondary antibodies were used (Molecular Probes; 1:200). All

Quantitation of vessel morphology
Tumor-bearing mice were injected with 1 mg of FITC-lectin
(FL 1101-5; Vector Labs) 20 minutes prior to sacrifice to
quantify vessel diameters of FAK WT and FAK CKO mice.
Vessel diameters were measured using Olympus Fluoview
1000 (ASW1.7b) software. To measure vascular density, immunohistochemistry was done on brain sections with tumor
using anti-CD31 antibody and Alexa-flour–conjugated secondary antibody as described above. Numbers of CD31-positive vessels were counted per unit area (630  630 mm2).

Results
Validation of the conditional and endothelium-specific
knockout of FAK in endothelium
To achieve conditional and endothelium-specific knockout
of FAK, mice with the second kinase domain exon of FAK
locus flanked by lox P sites (FAKflox/flox) mice (22) were
crossed with transgenic mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible
Cre under the regulation of the Tie2 promoter (Tie2-Cre/ERT2,
i.e., endothelium specific; ref. 23). These mice were then
backcrossed onto an immunodeficient background for the
purpose of xenografting human brain tumor cells. Using these
FAKflox/flox;Tie2-Cre/ERT2;Rag2/ (FAK CKO) mice, we first
validated efficient recombination following a time course of
tamoxifen administration, based on previous studies (29). In
consideration of the potential effects of tamoxifen in this
model, control mice were also subjected to tamoxifen but
lacked the Cre transgene with a genotype of FAKflox/flox;
Rag2/ and are referred to as FAK WT. The FAK deletion
in this model was assessed by immunoblotting isolated brain
microvessels from FAK CKO and FAK WT mice, using an
established technique for the biochemical isolation and analysis (26–28). Perfusion with fluorescent-labeled lectin 20
minutes prior to sacrifice, followed by imaging with a fluorescent microscope, verifies the integrity of isolated microvessels (Fig. 1A). Compared with the whole brain lysates, we
observed an enrichment of an endothelial cell marker, Pglycoprotein, and an astrocyte endfoot marker, AQ4, whereas
a decrease in a neuronal marker, Synaptophysin, was observed
(Fig. 1B; ref. 28). Using isolated microvessels from FAK CKO
and FAK WT mice, we determined that recombination
occurred as early as 3 days after tamoxifen treatment (data
not shown). Recombination of FAK gene was detected in Creexpressing FAK CKO mice, whereas no recombination was
detected in mice lacking the Cre transgene (Fig. 1C) or mice
treated with vehicle only (data not shown). The expression of
FAK protein is downregulated more than 5.8-fold at 7 days
after tamoxifen treatment in isolated microvessels (Fig. 1D).
We did not observe complete deletion of FAK gene (Fig. 1C,
top band) or complete removal of the FAK protein (Fig. 1D),
which can be partially explained by the isolation of capillary-

Figure 1. Validation of the conditional and endothelium-specific knockout of FAK in endothelium. A, brain microvessels from tamoxifen-treated mice
were isolated to verify efficient recombination of FAK locus. Brains were perfused with FITC-lectin before isolation of microvessels to validate their integrity.
Size bar, 20 mm. B, purity of isolated microvessels was verified by immunoblotting for the enrichment of an endothelial cell marker (i.e., P-glycoprotein) and an
astrocyte endfoot marker (i.e., AQ4) and decrease of a neuronal marker (i.e., Synaptophysin, Syn) in lysates from microvessels compared with their
levels detected in whole brain. Equal amount of total protein (20 mg) was loaded per lane. C, efficient Cre-mediated recombination and FAK deletion was
assessed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA from microvessels isolated from tamoxifen-treated brains. Results from 7 days after tamoxifen administration is
shown. Amplification of smaller 328-bp product (FAK CKO, arrow) indicates successful recombination in which control mice show amplification of
endogenous FAK gene (1.6 kb, arrowhead) with no detectable recombination (FAK WT). D, a decrease in FAK protein in lysates of brain microvessels of
FAK CKO mice was verified by Western blot analysis. A 6-fold decrease in FAK protein levels in FAK CKO brain microvessels was observed compared
with those in FAK WT mice (n ¼ 4–6 each) 7 days post–tamoxifen treatment. We did not observe downregulation of FAK expression in whole brain
lysates, indicating endothelial cell–specific deletion of FAK. Western blotting for b-actin was used as a loading control. *, P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum

microvessels. Importantly, we did not observe downregulation
of FAK expression in whole brain lysates, indicating endothelium-specific decrease of FAK (Fig. 1D). The FAK-deletion in
the adult endothelium of FAK CKO mice did not result in any
apparent morphologic changes of the vessels or changes in VP
in non–tumor-bearing brains (Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, we have not noticed any changes of the vessels in non–

is unknown. To determine whether an absence of FAK in the
host compartment vascular endothelium affects the growth of
orthotopic tumor cells (i.e., tumor compartment), we stereotaxically injected firefly luciferase-tagged human glioma cells
(DBTRG-luc) that are known to express VEGF (3) into the
brains of FAK CKO and FAK WT mice. Mice were noninvasively
imaged to detect the bioluminescence of the luciferase-labeled
tumor cells as described in the Materials and Methods section.
Earlier studies have reported the tight correlation between the
noninvasive, bioluminescent signal of luciferase-labeled tumor
cells with caliper-measured tumor volume in different organs
including the brain (30–32). Although rapid tumor growth was
observed in FAK WT host from 2 to 4 weeks, tumor growth in
the FAK CKO mice was reduced (Fig. 2). By day 28 postinjection, we observed a 15-fold reduction of tumor burden in FAK
CKO mice compared with FAK WT mice (P ¼ 0.002). We
observed similar results with ex vivo measurements of biolu-

standard hematoxylin and eosin staining of tumor tissue
(Supplementary Data, Fig. 2). In most cases, tumors of FAK
CKO mice eventually grow to the same size of the FAK WT
mice, but only with a longer incubation time (data not shown).
These results suggest that FAK is essential in the endothelium
of tumor-associated blood vessels in vivo.
FAK-mediated remodeling of brain tumor–associated
blood vessels
To determine whether the reduced tumor growth in FAK
CKO mice was associated with changes in the tumor vasculature, we examined morphologic and functional changes in
the vessels of FAK CKO versus FAK WT mice. In non–tumorbearing mouse brains, the appearance of the vessels was
generally similar in FAK CKO and FAK WT in terms of
vascular density, VP, and immunohistochemical staining of

(i.e., longer, thinner, less tortuous, and less branched in 3 dimensions; right, closed arrowheads in tumor area). Tumor margins were identified on the
basis of fluorescence of their RFP label (DBTRG-RFP) or distinct DAPI stained tumor pattern of luciferase labeled cells by tracing back to the injection

lamina, and astrocyte endfeet) (Supplementary Data, Fig. 1). In
contrast, the tumor-associated blood vessels FAK CKO mice
had a distinct phenotype compared with FAK WT mice
(Fig. 3). Consistent with previous observations in both CNS
and non-CNS tumors (33–35), intratumoral vessels in FAK WT
mice exhibited distorted, hyperdilated, and tortuous tumor
vessel architecture as assessed by perfusion labeling with the
fluorescence labeled lectin (Fig. 3A, open arrowheads in tumor
region; ref. 33). In contrast, tumor-associated blood vessels in
FAK CKO mice seemed to have a relatively "normalized"
phenotype in terms of the increased number of identifiable
intratumoral vessels (Fig. 3C). We have noted that vessels in
the brains of FAK CKO mice tended to be longer and thinner
(i.e., less tortuous; Fig. 3B) and less branched in 3 dimensions

(Fig. 3A, closed arrowheads in tumor region) than in intratumoral vessels in FAK WT mice. Yet, they are still relatively
hyperdilated when compared with vessels that were not
associated with tumor (data not shown). We also observed
similar morphologic changes of the intratumor vessels of FAK
CKO or FAK WT mice at tumor margins and in smaller
satellite tumors (data not shown).

vessels were leaky and increased extravasation of dextran was
observed, whereas in FAK CKO mice, tumor vessels were less
leaky and less extravasation of the dye was observed (Fig. 4A).
To quantitatively assess VP of tumor-associated vessels, FAK
CKO and FAK WT mice injected with RFP-labeled glioma cells
were injected intravenously with 70 kDa FITC-dextran followed by systemic saline perfusion. In FAK WT mice, we
observed a statistically significant correlation between the
tumor size (i.e., fluorescent intensity of RFP-labeled glioma
cells) and VP (i.e., fluorescent intensity of FITC-dextran;
Fig. 4C; P ¼ 0.002). In contrast, there was no correlation
between the tumor size and VP in FAK CKO mice (Fig. 4D; P ¼
0.78). Following a 4-week incubation period, the tumors in
FAK CKO host were generally smaller compared with those of
FAK WT mice as shown in Figure 2, so we let some FAK CKO
tumors grow larger to ensure that there was a difference in
permeability in size-matched tumors. After an additional 2week incubation period, on average we observed a 6.5-fold
reduction in VP in FAK CKO mice as compared with FAK WT
mice even in size-matched tumors (Fig. 4B; P < 0.05). We did
not observe any differences of VP in FAK CKO or FAK WT
mice brain sections with no tumor (used as internal controls;
Supplementary Fig. S1) indicating efficient perfusion of the
brains. This observation suggests that decreased VP in tumorassociated FAK CKO vessels may be associated with the
relatively "normalized" morphology of tumor-associated vessels in FAK CKO mice (Fig. 3).
Immunohistochemical assessment of FAK-mediated
changes in the BBB
To understand the mechanism underlying reduced VP that
was observed in tumors grown in the FAK CKO host (Fig. 4),
we examined the expression of cell–cell adhesion molecules in
the tumor vasculature. In particular, we focused on ZO-1 and
occludin, for the expression of these molecules is often
associated with intact endothelial barrier integrity in normal
vessels (36). Although tumor vessels in FAK WT mice have
reduced ZO-1 and occludin expression, the expression of these
molecules were relatively restored in intratumoral vessel of
FAK CKO mice (Fig. 5A and B).
Astrocyte endfeet have been shown by several groups to be
closely associated with brain endothelium (1), whereas there
are specific changes to these associated astrocyte structures in
endothelium of tumor (4, 37). Because AQ4-positive astrocyte
endfeet are implicated in the maintenance of normal BBB (1,
37, 38), we next examined tumor-induced remodeling of
specific BBB compartments. Relatively normal AQ4 distribution [i.e., restored expression and contact between astrocytes
with intratumoral vessel (Fig. 5C), as found in WT brain with
no tumor], was observed in FAK CKO host whereas astrocytic
contact with endothelial cells was lost in FAK WT host tissue
as described earlier (Fig. 5C; ref. 4).
In both FAK WT and FAK CKO mice, FAK deletion did not
mediate any further changes of the BBB with the markers we
have tested to this date (Supplementary Fig. S3A). But we
observed reactive astrocytes that were expressing GFAP and
AQ4 at the tumor margin in tumors of both FAK WT and FAK
CKO mice (Fig. 5C, top row, and Supplementary Fig. S3A) and

differential immunostaining of laminin inside the tumor bed
versus adjacent normal area as described earlier (4).
These results suggest that the restoration of cell–cell adhesion molecules in the endothelium and restoration of astrocyte–endothelium interaction in tumor vessels may
contribute together to reduced VP in FAK CKO mice
(Fig. 4). It also shows that specific changes in the endothelial
cells influence distinct, yet related, cellular mediation of BBB
integrity (i.e., astrocytes).

Discussion
In this study, we have characterized the effect of endothelium-specific deletion of FAK in the brain with a focus on a
VEGF-expressing brain tumor–mediated vascular remodeling.
We identify a novel role for FAK, a target of Src, in the
regulation of the endothelial component of the adult BBB.
We observed that FAK CKO mice had a relatively normalized
tumor vasculature (Fig. 3) with reduced VP (Fig. 4) and
reduced tumor growth (Fig. 2). Consistent with a role of
FAK in VP, our previous studies in Src knockout mice have
shown a leakage-resistant phenotype in the brain, leading to
reduction of glioma infiltration (3). Together, these studies
show genetic evidence for a role for the FAK signaling pathway
in the maintenance of BBB integrity.
On the basis of the central role for FAK in mediating
signaling from the extracellular matrix through integrin in
migration (39), tumor progression, and downstream responses
(40), there has been a major effort to better understand the
functional role of FAK in knockout animals. Standard FAKdeleted (FAK KO) embryos exhibit developmental defects,
including severely impaired blood vessel development (14).
Despite the integral role of FAK in the formation of focal
adhesions and migration (6, 41), FAK-null fibroblasts did not
prevent the formation of focal adhesions, suggesting a role for
FAK in the turnover of focal adhesions (42). Endothelial cell–
specific deletion of FAK also led to an embryonic lethal
phenotype, thus functionally showing the requirement for
FAK in vascular development (14, 16–18). More recently,
differential role of kinase-independent and -dependent functions of FAK in vascular development of embryogenesis has
been reported (20, 21). These studies propose that the kinase
activity of FAK is required to maintain the integrity of endothelial cells whereas the structural functions of FAK are likely to be
important for endothelial cell survival (20, 21). In addition, we
have previously shown that the phosphorylated form of FAK is
associated with Src in VEGF-mediated activation of endothelial cells (8). On the basis of these studies, it is likely that the
kinase activity of FAK is essential in mediating tumor-induced
VP shown in our CNS model.
When using knockout mouse models, consideration of
mechanism of compensation is essential, and in the case of
FAK CKO mice, evidence for such compensation by PYK2
has been described in vitro and in vivo (19, 43–45). Although
we did not observe an increase in PYK2 in our FAK CKO
mice (data not shown), further examination of such models
may yield important insights into tissue-specific compensatory pathways.

FAK-Mediated Permeability of Blood–Brain Barrier

The orthotopic xenograft brain tumor model used in this
study is well suited for identifying the tumor-induced changes
in the host compartment where the focus is host (i.e., endothelia and indirectly astrocytes) rather than tumor cells. By using
different genetic backgrounds of the host (i.e., Src KO and
endothelium-specific FAK KO), we can examine the functional
relevance of specific signaling intermediates in the BBB that
affect glioma progression. Although other cell types in the
brain participate in maintaining the BBB (i.e., through interaction with astrocyte endfeet), in vivo studies to understand
the mechanism regulating the interaction between endothelial
cells and astrocytes remains poorly understood. Our study
shows that specific changes in the endothelial cells mediate
changes in astrocytes as observed by the remodeling of the
structure and function of endothelium-associated astrocyte
endfeet in the BBB in vivo (Fig. 5). To this end, we observed a
correlation between restoration of AQ4 and downregulation of
VP; however, it would be necessary to further investigate the
role of AQ4 in VP, using other functional models (e.g., AQ4knockout mice). Together these studies provide the basis for

the systematic dissection of the role of specific cell types,
which through targeted gene knockout strategies can be used
to determine the functional relevance of endothelium–astrocyte interactions in vivo. Alterations in these interactions may
be useful to better understand in the development of therapeutics that crosses the BBB.
