ABSTRACT
There is no effective drug to treat EV71 infection yet. Traditional Chinese herbs
are great resources for novel antiviral compounds. Here we showed that Oblongifolin
M (OM), an active compound isolated from Garcinia oblongifolia, potently inhibited
EV71 infection in a dose dependent manner. To identify its potential effectors in the
host cells, we successfully identiﬁed 18 proteins from 52 differentially expressed
spots by comparative proteomics studies. Further studies showed that knockdown of
ERp57 inhibited viral replication through downregulating viral IRES (internal ribosome
entry site) activities, whereas ectopic expression of ERp57 increased IRES activity
and partly rescued the inhibitory effects of OM on viral replication. We demonstrated
that OM is an effective antiviral agent; and that ERp57 is one of its cellular effectors
against EV71 infection.

HFMD cases were reported in China between 2008
and 2012, of which 2457 were fatal [4, 5]. No effective
antiviral drug is currently used for treating EV71 infection
[6]; therefore, there is an urgent need for effective agent
against EV71 infection.
Chinese Medical herbs are a great reservoir of active
compounds against microbial infections [7–14]. Plants
generate a great deal of compounds to eliminate or limit
microbe invasions. The family Guttiferae contains more
than 450 species distributed over regions mostly in Asia,
southern Africa and Western Polynesia. Many bioactive
compounds, such as prenylated xanthenes, benzophenones,
biﬂavonoids,
and

INTRODUCTION
Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a member of the
Picornaviridae family, is a non-enveloped singlestranded RNA virus. It is the major causative agent of
repeated outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease
(HFMD) [1, 2]. In severe cases, especially those among
in infants and children, EV71 infection causes severe
neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis,
brain stem encephalitis, pulmonary edema, poliomyelitislike paralysis and eventual death. In the last decade, the
continuous outbreaks of EV71 in Asia-Paciﬁc region
have caused considerable deaths [3]. More than 7 million

acylphloroglucinols, have been isolated from different
family members [15–23]. They exhibit various biological
activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant,
anti-inﬂammatory and anticancer effects [15–23], despite
the underlining mechanisms being poorly understood.
With the growing number of natural antiviral
compounds identiﬁed, a promising option would be
to ﬁnd new compounds from medical herbs to combat
EV71 infection [24–26]. Instructed by bioactivity-guided
isolation, a new isoprenyl benzophenone derivative
Oblongifolin M (compound M from Oblongifolia, OM),
has been isolated from medical herb Garcinia oblongifolia
[27]. In this study, we investigated its antiviral activity
against EV71 infection and the underlying mechanisms
through comparable proteomics studies.

of culture dishes. When cells were infected with EV71 at
a multiple of infection (MOI) of 1, many cells showed
CPE. They became round, detached from the surface of
culture dishes and ﬂoated away 12 hours post-infection
(p.i.) (Figure 1B). When the cells were pretreated with 15
μM of OM 4 hours prior to EV71 infection, most cells
were healthy with only a few exhibiting CPE (Figure 1C),
an indication that the infected cells were signiﬁcantly
protected from CPE. Surprisingly, almost all EV71infected cells were healthy when pretreated with 30 μM
of OM (Figure 1D). Similar results were also obtained
from HEK 293 cells and Hela cells (data not shown).
The reduction of EV71-induced CPE by 50% (IC50) was
determined byusing GraphPad Prism5. As shown in Table
1 , the IC50 of OM was 2.38±0.79 μM. Cell viability was
employed to determine the toxicity of OM in RD cells
by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-Htetrazolium bromide) assays after treating RD cells with
OM for 24h. Compared with untreated cells, cell viability
was not obviously affected by OM at a concentration
of 50 μM. The CC50 (concentration of OM required for
50% cell kill) of the uninfected cells was 83.87±1.12 μM.
The selectivity of OM on RD cells was 35.24 (Table 1),
indicating OM’s potential to be an effective antiviral agent
against EV71 infection.

RESULTS
Protection of cytopathic effects (CPE) caused by
EV71 infection
The antiviral effect of OM was tested in
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells by CPE assays. As shown
in Figure 1A, the RD cells without viral infection were ﬂat
with spindle-like sharps and attached well on the surface

RD cells A. to D. RD cells were pretreated without (A, B) or with OM (C, D) for 4 hours before EV71 infection at a MOI of 1. Photos were taken

12 hours post-infection (p.i.). E. OM inhibited EV71 reproduction. The virions in the culture supernatant were harvested 12 hours p.i. and the viral
titer was determined by TCID50 assays. F. OM inhibited EV71 replication. 12 hous p.i., the intracellular RNA was isolated, and viral genomic RNA
(primers targeting VP1 gene) and cellular mRNA of GAPDH genes were quantitated by qRT-PCR. The viral genomic RNA level was normalized
with the copy number of mRNA of GAPHD. The mean value of VP1/GAPDH ratio was set as 1 in control. G. The viral VP1 protein was decreased
by OM in a dose dependent manner. The cells were harvested 12 hours p.i. at MOI of 1, and cell lysate was applied for Western blot assays.

DMSO (control) or 30 μM of OM were extracted and
resolved by 2-DE analysis 48 hours post-treatment. Figure
2 shows a representative pair of silver-stained 2-DE maps
between two samples from three pairs of gels (Figure 2A and
2B). After comparison, 52 spots showed signiﬁcant (with
over 2-fold, p < 0.05) difference. The individual protein
spot was extracted and digested for MALD-TOF MS and
MS/MS analysis. Typical images of ﬁve paired spots were
cropped and enlarged as shown in Figure 2C. We successfully
identiﬁed 18 proteins with signiﬁcant differential expression.
Among them, eight proteins were markedly up-regulated
whereas ten were down-regulated in the OM-treated RD
cells as compared to the control group. The characteristics
of proteins (including name, abbreviation, NCBI accession
number, theoretical molecular mass, pI, peptide count, protein
score (conﬁdence interval in percent), number of unmatched
masses, sequence coverage, fold change, and functions) are
listed in Table 2. Functionally, they can be categorized into six
categories: structural molecular activity (17%), metabolism
(39%), cytoskeleton and transport proteins (11%), gene
transcription associated proteins (6%), heat shock proteins
and chaperones (17%), and cell proliferation, metastasis, and
signal transduction proteins (11%).

To further determine OM’s antiviral potency, we
titrated the viral titers in the culture media. As shown in
Figure 1E, the mean value of viral titers was 5.6 × 106 pfu/
ml in the control group. After treatment of the cells with 15
μM of OM, the viral titers signiﬁcantly decreased to 3.42 ×
106 ± 6.4 × 105 pfu/ml. When the concentration of OM was
increased to 30 μM, surprisingly, the viral titers dramatically
dropped by over 90% to 2.5 × 105 ± 1.1 × 105 pfu/ml. The
antiviral effects were further validated by measuring the
intracellular viral genomic RNA copies and viral protein
levels. Twelve hours after infection, the copy number of
viral genomic RNA decreased by 23%, 65%, 84% and 95%
after cells were treated with OM at concentrations of 15,
20, 25, and 30 μM, respectively (Figure 1F). Consistently,
the levels of intracellular VP1 protein were signiﬁcantly
inhibited by OM in a dose dependent manner (Figure 1G).

The effects of OM on protein proﬁles
To investigate the potential antiviral mechanisms
of OM against EV71 infection, we employed comparable
proteomics studies. Proteins from RD cells treated with

4B). We further examined if knockdown of ERp57 would
affect virus entry. RD cells were ﬁrst transfected with either
scrambled or si-ERp57-1 for 48 hours, and then infected
with EV71 at MOI of 20 for 1 hour on ice. The infected cells
were washed with PBS for three times to remove potential
free viruses that had not entered the cells. We employed
qRT-PCR to measure the intracellular viral RNA levels. Our
data showed that the entry of EV71 had not been affected
by ERp57 knockdown (Figure 4C). To further investigate
if ERp57 knockdown would affect EV71 replication or
reproduction, we ﬁrst measured the intracellular viral RNA
levels at different time points. We showed that ERp57
knockdown signiﬁcantly decreased the intracellular viral
RNA levels at 3 and 5 hours p.i. (Figure 4D), and markedly
reduced the secreted virions in the culture media collected
at 5 and 7 hours p.i. (Figure 4E). These results indicate that
ERp57 was involved in the early phase of viral life cycle.

We carried out Western blot assays to conﬁrm the
differentially expressed protein levels after we treated
the RD cells with OM for 48 hours. Among ﬁve selected
candidate proteins, four displayed similar expression
patterns as shown in the 2-DE assays. The protein levels
of ERp57, RCN-1, RCN-3, and CALU signiﬁcantly
decreased after OM treatment (Figure 3A).
ERp57 drew our particular attention because it is
crucial for the entry of SV40 and murine rotavirus [28, 29].
To further observe the correlation between the expression
levels of ERp57 and EV71 viral proteins, RD cells were
treated with or without 30 μM of OM for 4 hours, and
then infected with EV71 (MOI 1). As shown in Figure
3B, OM not only suppressed ERp57 expression, but also
signiﬁcantly decreased viral VP1 and VP2 levels. These
results indicated that ERp57 might involve the life cycle
of EV71.

Inhibition of IRES activity by OM and ERp57
Our previous study showed that active replication
of EV71 occurs just after uncoating (3 to 6 hours p.i.)
[30]. After uncoating, the ﬁrst and key event is viral
protein translation driven by IRES [31]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that OM may inhibit EV71 infection by
down-regulation of IRES activity through ERp57. To test
this hypothesis, we generated two constructs to express
reporters Renilla luciferase (RLuc) and Fireﬂy luciferase
(FLuc). As shown in Figure 5A, two continuous stop
codes (TGA TGA) were inserted between RLuc and FLuc

Suppression of EV71 by knockdown of ERp57
We tested the effects of ERp57 knockdown on EV71
infections. As shown in Figure 4A, both si-ERp57-1 and
ERp57-2 effectively reduced the mRNA level of ERp57. As
si-ERp57-1 was more effective on knocking down ERp57,
si-ERp57-1 was chosen for further experiments in our study.
Consistent with the reduction of mRNA level, ERp57 protein
level was also signiﬁcantly decreased by si-ERp57-1 (Figure

were harvested and applied for Western blot assays. As shown, ERp57, RCN-1, RCN-2 and Calumenin were markedly down-regulated by
OM treatment. B. Cells were pretreated with 30 μM of OM for 4 hours, and then infected with EV71 at MOI of 1 for 12 hours. As shown,
OM suppressed the expression of ERp57, and viral proteins VP1 and VP2. The relative density value of each band to GAPHD was set as
1 in the control group.

Restoration of OM-suppressed IRES activity by
ectopic expression of ERp57

genes in pRF plasmid; while the IRES sequence of EV71
was inserted between RLuc and FLuc genes in pIRES
plasmids. In both constructs, the CMV promoter drives
RLuc expression. FLuc translation is stopped when mRNA
is transcribed from pRF, whereas the translation would be
successful from that of pIRES. Hence, the IRES activity
can be measured and expressed by the ratio of FLuc to
RLuc activities.
We showed that OM did not affect the ratio of FLuc/
RLuc when cells were transfected with pRF plasmid;
however, the ratio of FLuc/RLuc decreased after cells
were transfected with pIRES and treated with OM. The
inhibition of IRES activity was in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 5B). As expected, when ERp57 was
knocked down, the IRES activity of EV71 markedly
decreased (Figure 5C), correlating with the inhibitory
effects of OM.

We constructed an expression plasmid to express
human ERp57 in HEK 293 cells. As shown in Figure 6A,
the ectopic expression of ERp57 signiﬁcantly stimulated
the IRES activity of EV71. Furthermore, we examined
if ectopic expression of ERp57 would restore the viral
replication that had been inhibited by OM. ERp57 was
ectopically expressed in RD cells and pretreated with
OM at 30 μM for 4 hours. The cells were then infected
with EV71 at MOI 1. We showed that the viral RNA
level decreased to 25% that of the control 5 hours p.i.,
whereas the viral RNA level was restored to that 53% of
the control upon overexpression of ERp57. Our results
demonstrated that ERp57 partly restored the IRES
activity suppressed by OM.

DISCUSSION

upregulated by OM. Whether these proteins contribute
to the viral inhibition of OM should be investigated
in future studies. Although several other compounds
isolated from Garcinia oblongifolia (e.g., Oblongifolia
L or P) share similar structure to OM, it antiviral effects
against EV71 was much weaker (data not shown).
Further investigating the underling mechanism may help
us to develop OM derivatives with more potent antiEV71 activity.
In summary, we showed that OM, an active
compound isolated from a traditional Chinese herb,
potently inhibited EV71 infection. By employing
comparative proteomics studies, we identiﬁed that ERp57
was an effector of OM. Knockdown of ERp57 inhibited
viral replication through downregulating viral IRES
activities, whereas ectopic expression of ERp57 increased
IRES activity and partly rescued the inhibition of viral
replication by OM. Our results demonstrated that OM
inhibited the early replication of EV71 partly through
downregulating ERp57. OM could potentially be further
developed into a therapeutic drug for treating EV71
infections, and ERp57 may serve as a target for developing
host-based antiviral drugs against EV71 infection.

There is no effective drug to treat EV71
infection [31–33]. In this paper, we showed that an
effective compound OM isolated from Garcinia
oblongifolia displayed potent anti-EV71 activitythrough
downregulation of ERp57, an important host factor in the
early phase of EV71 life cycle.
Host proteins are ideal targets for antiviral drug
development because targeting host proteins would avoid
or delay the occurrence of drug resistance due to fast
mutagenesis of viruses. ERp57, a chaperon protein involved
in catalyzing bisulfate bond exchange for correct protein
folding in ER stress, has been shown a crucial role in the
entry of DNA virus SV40 [28]. Besides virus entry, it is
possible that ERp57 may exhibit other functions in the life
cycle of other viruses. As an RNA virus, EV71 has a life
cycle that is completely different from that of SV40. An
important question is whether ERp57 exhibits a similar
function in the life cycle of EV71. To address this question,
we ﬁrst investigated if the viral entry of EV71 would be
affected by knockdown of ERp57. To our surprise, the
depletion of ERp57 did not affect virus entry into the host
cells (Figure 4C). Interestingly, we found that the virus
replication was signiﬁcantly suppressed at 3 to 5 hours p.i.
after ERp57 knockdown in the host RD cells (Figure 4D).
Accordingly, the secreted virions evidently decreased at 5
to 7 hours p.i. (Figure 4E). In our previous study, we have
shown that EV71 undergoes the fast replication phase from
3 to 6 hours p.i. in RD cells, and carries out fast package
from 6 to 9 hours p.i. (package phase) and secretion
initiation [30]. Our results suggested that ERp57 involves
mainly in the early phase of viral life cycle.
The ﬁrst event of viral activity is IRES-mediated
translation in generating proteins required for viral RNA
replication after uncoating of virus in the host cells. We
hypothesized that ERp57 may affect viral translation
through regulating viral IRES activities. Our results
showed that knockdown of ERp57 signiﬁcantly reduced
the viral IRES activities (Figure 5B). Intriguingly, OM
also suppressed the IRES activity in a dose dependent
manner (Figure 5C), demonstrating a correlation between
drug effects and ERp57 functions. To further validate our
ﬁndings, we conducted gain-of-function studies. ERp57
was ectopically expressed in host cells to test its effects
on IRES activity. As expected, results from this study
exhibited an increase of IRES activity by ectopic ERp57
expression (Figure 6A). This suggests that OM may
affect ERp57 functions in an indirect or direct manner.
We have noted that ectopic expression of ERp57 partly
rescued the inhibition of early replication of EV71
(Figure 6B), indicating that in addition to ERp57, there
must be other host factors contributing to the inhibitory
effects of OM on EV71 reproduction. As shown in Table
II, 10 proteins were down-regulated and 8 proteins were

AF302996.1) [30, 44, 45] was propagated on 90% conﬂuent
monolayer cells in DMEM with 2% FBS. When about 80%
of the cells exhibited CPE, culture ﬂuid was collected,
centrifuged, ﬁltrated and stored in -80°C until use. The
viral titer was determined by the end-point dilution assay of
median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50).

CPE assay

Ex Taq (Takara). The PCR was set up under the following
thermal cycling conditions: 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40
cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 34 s. The threshold
cycle (CT) value was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [47, 48]. The qRTPCR was performed by using the following primer pairs:
GAPDH,
5′-GATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTCCA-3’
(forward) and 5’-TGGTGATGGGATTTCCATTGATGA-3’
(reverse); EV71, 5’-GCAGCCCAAAAGAACTTCAC3’and
5’-ATTTCAGCAGCTTGGAGTGC-3’;
for
ERP57, 5’-GTGCTAGAACTCACGGACGA-3’ and
5’-GCTGCAGCTTCATACTCAGG-3’. All samples
were run in triplicates, and the experiment was repeated
three times. The relative mRNA level of each target gene
was expressed as fold change relative to the value of the
corresponding control.

Antiviral activity of OM was evaluated by CPE
assays. Approximately 20,000 RD cells per well were laid in
96-well plate for 24 hours at 37°C to reach monolayer, then
treated with OM at different concentrations and infected
by EV71 at MOI of 0.01 or 1 (Supplementary Table S1).
CPE was monitored from time to time under a phasecontrast microscope and recorded by a CCD camera. The
concentration required for the tested compound to reduce
the EV71-induced CPE by 50% (IC50) was determined
by using the Forecast function of Microsoft Excel for all
experiments. Data were shown as mean values with standard
deviations from three independent assays. Selectivity index
(SI) is calculated by the ratio of CC50 to IC50.

Cytotoxicity test

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
and image analysis

Cytoxicity of OM was evaluated by cell viability
assays. RD cells (about 20,000 cells) were set in each
well of a 96-well plate overnight to reach monolayer
and exposed to serial dilution of OM for 24 hours. Cell
viability was measured by the MTT method as described
previously [46, 47]. The CC50 was calculated.

RD cells were treated with 30 μM of OM (in DMSO)
or an equal amount of DMSO for 48 hours. The cells were
washed with wash buffer (10 mM Tris, 250 mM sucrose,
pH 7.0) six times to remove salt ions thoroughly, lysed
with lysis buffer (8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% CHAPS,
1%Nonidet P-40, 2 mM tributylphosphine, 1× Roche
Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture, 1× nuclease
mixture, 1 mM PMSF, 2% IPG buffer), and then left on
ice for 45 min with occasional vortex. The lysates were
centrifuged (14,000 g for 15 min) at 4 °C, the supernatants
were collected and stored at -80 °C until use. Protein
concentrations were measured by Bradford assay (BioRad). Isoelectric focusing was conducted with 13-cm
precast IPG strips (pH 4–7, linear; GE Healthcare) by an
Ettan IPGphor II IEF System (Amersham Biosciences).
The IPG strips containing 150 μg of protein samples were
rehydrated for 10 h at 30 V with 250 μl rehydration buffer
(8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.4% DTT, 0.5% IPG buffer,
0.002% bromphenol blue). We then focused the rehydrated
strips using a stepwise voltage increment program: 500 and
1000 V for 1 h each and 8000 V afterward until 64 kV-h.
After IEF, we incubated the isoelectrically focused strips
in an equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 1% DTT, 2% SDS,
30% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 6.8) for 15 min with gentle agitation, then incubated
the strips for another 15 min in the same buffer containing
2.5% iodoacetamide without DTT. Then we loaded the
equilibrated strips onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels,
run at 15 mA/gel for 30 min and then 30 mA/gel until the
dye fronts reached the bottoms of the gels. We stained the
gels by modiﬁed silver staining, which was compatible with
MS analysis. Gels were scanned with a calibrated GS-800
scanner (Bio-Rad), and the intensity of spots was calculated
and compared by using Quantity One and PDQuest 2-D
analysis software (version 8.0; Bio-Rad) as described
previously [35]. A 2-fold increase/decrease (DMSO-treated

Western blot
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1×Roche
protease inhibitor cocktail) with occasional vortex. The cell
lysates were then centrifuged to remove debris at 14,000
rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The concentration of proteins in the
lysates was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal
amounts of total protein for each sample was loaded and
separated by 8% to 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred
onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes
(Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with
5% skim milk in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and incubated with speciﬁc
antibodies. GAPDH was served as the loading control.
Target proteins were detected with corresponding secondary
antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), visualized with
a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham
Biosciences). Each immunoblot assay was carried out at
least three times as previously reported [44].

Real-time RT-PCR
The total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The virion RNA in the culture media was
isolated using a viral RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). RNA
was than reverse transcribed into cDNA using a reverse
transcription system (Promega). Quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out by using
an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system with SYBR Premix

was measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays.

versus OM-treated RD cells) of spot intensities was set as
the threshold for indicating signiﬁcant changes.

MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and MS/MS
spectrometry analysis
Selected spots were manually cut from the gels,
destained, washed and dried completely by vacuum and
digested with 10 μg/ml trypsin (Promega) in 25 mM
ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 for 16–18 h at 37 °C. The
supernatants containing tryptic peptides were collected.
We mixed 2 μl of peptide solution with 0.6 μl of matrix
(6 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxylcinnamic acid in 45% ACN
and 0.2% TFA) before spotting onto the MALDI plate.
The samples were applied for mass spectrometric analyses
by using a MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometer
Ultraﬂex III proteomics analyzer (Bruker Daltonics).
We obtained mass spectra from 2000 laser shots with an
accelerating voltage of 20 kV with mass ranges of 700–
4000 m/z in a positive ion reﬂectron mode and mass errors
of less than 100 ppm by using the FlexControl (version
3.3.108.0, Bruker Daltonics). We obtained MS/MS spectra
by collecting 3000 laser shots with a default calibration.
The detected MS/MS peaks were set on a minimum
S/N ratio ≥3 and cluster area S/N threshold ≥15 with
smoothing, as described previously [49]. The information
from combined MS and MS/MS analysis was applied for
protein identiﬁcation search against SwissPort database
(545388 protein sequences; released on June 23, 2014) by
the Mascot search engine (version 2.2.04; Matrix Science)
and BioTools software (version 3.5; Bruker Daltonics).
The search parameters were deﬁned as follows: taxonomy
of Homo sapiens, trypsin digest with a maximum of
one missed cleavage, ﬁxed modiﬁcation of cysteine
carbamidomethylation, variable modiﬁcation of methionine
oxidation, monoisotopic peptide mass (MH+), mass range
unrestricted, pI of 0–14, precursor tolerance of 100 ppm,
and MS/MS fragment tolerance of 0.5 Da. Before database
searching, we removed the known contaminant ions from
the spectra, which correspond to human keratin and trypsin
autolysis peptides. The top 20 hits for each protein search
were reported. The protein candidate was reported only
when it met the maximum number of matched peptides and
a pI value nearest to the observed value. Each isoform of a
protein family, which was identiﬁed, was considered to be
a distinct protein for analysis, as described previously [49].

EV71 infection, quantiﬁcation of intracellular
and extracellular viral genomic RNA
RD cells were preincubated with OM for 4 hours
or transfected with siRNAs for 48 hours, the cells were
washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and
infected with EV71 at MOI of 1. Time was set to zero after
adsorption for 1 h. The culture media were removed and
cells were washed twice with PBS to remove unattached
virus before adding 0.2 mL of DMEM medium containing
2% FBS to each well. To quantify the intracellular viral
RNA or extracellular viral RNA in the virions, total
RNA was isolated from infected cells or culture media at
different time-points and further subjected to qRT-PCR
assays [30].

Luciferase activity assay
Cells (HEK 293) were set in 12-well dishes
overnight, then transfected with 100 ng of pRF or pIRES
plasmid. 24 hours post-transfection, cells were treated
without or with OM at a ﬁnal concentration of 15 or 30
μM for 12 hours. The cells were then harvested and cell
lysates were applied for luciferase assays using a Dual
Luciferase Assay System (Promega, WI) in accordance
with manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). All statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS,
version 14.0 software (SPSS Inc.). Two-tailed Student’s
t test was applied for two group comparisons. A p value
<0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
