Abstract
Metastatic breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths among women. Triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) is a highly aggressive subcategory of breast cancer and
currently lacks well-deﬁned molecular targets for effective targeted therapies. Disease relapse, metastasis, and drug resistance
render standard chemotherapy ineffective in the treatment of
TNBC. Because previous studies coupled b3 integrin (ITGB3) to
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, we
exploited b3 integrin as a therapeutic target to treat TNBC by
delivering b3 integrin siRNA via lipid ECO-based nanoparticles
(ECO/sib3). Treatment of TNBC cells with ECO/sib3 was sufﬁcient to effectively silence b3 integrin expression, attenuate
TGFb-mediated EMT and invasion, restore TGFb-mediated
cytostasis, and inhibit three-dimensional organoid growth.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths
among women in the United States (1). The 5-year relative survival
rate for women with localized disease is 98.6%; however, for those
diagnosed with distant metastases, survival rates fall below 25%
(2). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive
subcategory of breast cancer that lack the expression of estrogen
receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), as well as HER2
ampliﬁcation. Currently, there is a lack of targeted therapies for
TNBCs, which renders chemotherapy as the standard of care (3–5).
Although TNBC patients are initially responsive to chemotherapy,
most patients relapse, and the recurrent tumor is usually highly
metastatic and resistant to traditional chemotherapy, which leads
to a disproportionately large number of deaths (3–6). Importantly, metastasis is associated with the aberrant activation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT; refs. 7–9), which endows
cancer cells with elevated capabilities to invade and disseminate

Modiﬁcation of ECO/sib3 nanoparticles with an RGD peptide
via a PEG spacer enhanced siRNA uptake by post-EMT
cells. Intravenous injections of RGD-targeted ECO/sib3 nanoparticles in vivo alleviated primary tumor burden and, more
importantly, signiﬁcantly inhibited metastasis. In the span of
16 weeks of the experiments and observations, including primary tumor resection at week 9 and release from the treatment
for 4 weeks, the mice bearing orthotopic, TGFb-prestimulated
MDA-MB-231 tumors that were treated with RGD-targeted
ECO/sib3 nanoparticles were free of metastases and relapse,
in comparison with untreated mice. Collectively, these results
highlight ECO/sib3 nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic
regimen to combat TNBC. Cancer Res; 75(11); 2316–25. 2015

to distant sites (10). Various molecular and microenvironmental
factors can induce EMT, including TGFb. TGFb is a pleiotropic
cytokine that regulates virtually all aspects of mammary gland
biology. TGFb induces the dramatic upregulation of b3 integrin,
which is essential for EMT and breast cancer metastasis (11–13).
Previous work has demonstrated that functional disruption of b3
integrin (ITGB3) inhibits TGFb-mediated cytostasis, EMT, and
invasion in vitro (11) and reduces primary tumor burden in vivo
(14). Given the essential roles that b3 integrin plays in mediating
breast cancer tumor progression, we hypothesize that silencing b3
integrin expression has the potential to effectively treat TNBC.
RNAi is a natural biologic mechanism for modulating gene
expression and can be exploited to effectively regulate the
expression of b3 integrin in treating TNBC. Clinical application
of RNAi requires efﬁcient delivery of therapeutic siRNA into the
cytoplasm of target cells (15, 16). We have recently developed a
multifunctional cationic lipid-based carrier (1-aminoethyl)iminobis[N-oleicylsteinyl-1-aminoethyl)propionamide] (ECO),
which can effectively mediate cytosolic siRNA delivery and
facilitate efﬁcient gene silencing in cancer cells (Fig. 1A;
refs. 15, 17). ECO self-assembly with therapeutic siRNA forms
stable nanoparticles that can be readily functionalized with
targeting moieties to achieve targeted siRNA delivery to cancer
cells. Considering the critical roles of b3 integrin in regulating
EMT, proliferation and metastasis (11, 14, 18–20) and the
unmet need for targeted therapies tailored to TNBC (3, 4, 21),
we sought to evaluate silencing b3 integrin by targeted ECO–
siRNA nanoparticles to treat metastatic breast cancer.
The present study demonstrates the efﬁcacy of ECO/sib3 nanoparticles in silencing b3 integrin expression and the consequent

In Vivo Silencing of b3 Integrin Inhibits TNBC Metastasis

inhibition of TGFb-mediated EMT and invasion in breast cancer
cells in vitro. The nanoparticles were modiﬁed with a cyclic RGD
peptide via a PEG spacer to improve biocompatibility and systemic target–speciﬁc delivery of the therapeutic sib3 in vivo
(11, 22). The efﬁcacy of the targeted ECO/sib3 nanoparticles in
alleviating primary tumor burden and inhibiting TNBC metastasis was determined in tumor-bearing mice following multiple i.v.
injections.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured
in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). NME
cells are normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG; obtained
from the ATCC) cells that were engineered to overexpress EGFR by
VSVG retroviral transduction of particles encoded from a pBabe–
EGFR construct as previously described (23) and cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 mg/mL of insulin.
TGFb-stimulated NME cells are a model of TNBC, which display
aggressive, post-surgical primary tumor recurrence and metastatic
phenotypes (23, 24). Both cell lines were engineered to stably
express ﬁreﬂy luciferase by transfection with pNifty-CMV-luciferase and selection with Zeocin (500 mg/mL; Invitrogen). Cell lines
were not independently authenticated. Early passage cells were
used for all cell and tumor work. The following siRNAs were
purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville):
Mouse integrin b3 sense: (GCUCAUCUGGAAGCUACUCAUCACT), mouse integrin b3 antisense: (AGUGAUGAGUAGCUUCCAGAUGAGCUC), human integrin b3 sense: (GCUCAUCUGGAAACUCCUCAUCACC), and human integrin b3 antisense:
(GGUGAUGAGGAGUUUCCAGAUGAGCUC).
Preparation of ECO–siRNA nanoparticles
The ECO lipid carrier was synthesized as described previously
(15). ECO (MW ¼ 1023) was dissolved in 100% ethanol at a
stock concentration of 2.5 mmol/L for in vitro experiments and
50 mmol/L for in vivo experiments. Mouse and human siRNAs
were reconstituted in RNase-free water to a concentration of 18.8
mmol/L for in vitro experiments and 25 mmol/L for in vivo experiments. For in vitro experiments, an siRNA transfection concentration of 100 nmol/L was used. ECO–siRNA nanoparticles were
prepared at an N/P ratio of 7.7 by mixing predetermined volumes
of ECO and siRNA for a period of 30 minutes in RNase-free water
(pH 5.5) at room temperature under gentle agitation to enable
complexation between ECO and siRNA. The total volume of water
was determined such that the volume ratio of ethanol:water
remained ﬁxed at 1:20. For RGD- and RAD-modiﬁed ECO–siRNA
nanoparticles, RGD-PEG3400-Mal or RAD-PEG3400-Mal (PEG,
3,400 Da, NANOCS) was ﬁrst reacted with ECO in RNase-free
water at 2.5 mol% for 30 minutes under gentle agitation and
subsequently mixed with siRNA in RNase-free water for an additional 30 minutes. RGD-PEG3400-Mal or RAD-PEG3400-Mal were
prepared at a stock solution concentration of 0.32 mmol/L in
RNase-free water. Again, the total volume of water was determined such that the volume ratio of ethanol:water remained ﬁxed
at 1:20. After the incubation, free peptide derivative was removed
from RGD- and RAD-modiﬁed ECO–siRNA nanoparticles by
ultraﬁltration (Nanosep, MWCO ¼ 100 K, 5,000  g, 5 minutes;
Sigma-Aldrich). Conjugation of RGD-PEG3400-Mal to ECO was
determined and conﬁrmed through matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry

using a Bruker Autoﬂex III MALDI-TOF instrument. The size of
RGD-modiﬁed ECO–siRNA nanoparticles in PBS was determined
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Brookhaven ZetaPALS
Particle Size Analyzer.
Western blot analyses
Immunoblotting analyses were performed as previously
described (25). Brieﬂy, NME and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded
into 6-well plates (1.5  105 cells/well) and allowed to adhere
overnight. The cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of TGFb1 (5 ng/mL) for 3 days and then treated with ECO–
siRNA complexes for 4 hours in complete growth medium. At
each indicated time point, detergent-solubilized whole-cell
extracts (WCE) were prepared by lysing the cells in Buffer H
(50 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L
DTT, 0.2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L benzamidine, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, and 10 mg/mL aprotinin, pH 7.3).
The clariﬁed WCE (20 mg/lane) were separated through 10%
SDS-PAGE, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the primary antibodies, anti-b3
integrin (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti–b-actin
(1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Flow cytometry for nanoparticle cellular uptake
Cellular uptake and intracellular delivery of ECO–siRNA and
RGD–ECO–siRNA nanoparticles was evaluated quantitatively
using ﬂow cytometry. ECO–siRNA and RGD–ECO–siRNA nanoparticles were prepared with 40 nmol/L Alexa Fluor 488–labeled
siRNA (Qiagen). Approximately 2.5  104 NME cells were seeded
onto 12-well plates and grown for an additional 24 hours. The cells
were transfected with ECO–siRNA nanoparticles in 10% serum
media. After 4 hours, the transfection media were removed and
each well was washed twice with PBS. The cells were harvested by
treatment with 0.25% trypsin containing 0.26 mmol/L EDTA
(Invitrogen), collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes, resuspended in 500 mL of PBS containing 5% paraformaldehyde, and ﬁnally passed through a 35-mm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Cellular internalization of the nanoparticles was quantiﬁed by the ﬂuorescence intensity measurement of Alexa Fluor 488
for a total of 1  104 cells per sample using a BD FACSCalibur ﬂow
cytometer. All the experiments were performed in triplicate and the
data represent mean ﬂuorescence intensity and standard deviation.
Semiquantitative real-time PCR analyses
Real-time PCR studies were performed as described previously (18, 25). Brieﬂy, NME or MDA-MB-231 cells (100,000
cells/well) were seeded overnight onto 6-well plates and treated
with TGFb (5 ng/mL) for 3 days upon delivery of ECO nanoparticles with a nonspeciﬁc siRNA or b3 integrin-speciﬁc siRNA.
At each indicated time point, total RNA was isolated using the
RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using the
iScript cDNA Synthesis System (Bio-Rad). Semiquantitative
real-time PCR was conducted using iQ-SYBR Green (Bio-Rad)
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In all cases,
differences in RNA expression for each individual gene were
normalized to their corresponding GAPDH RNA signals.
Invasion and proliferation assays
Invasion assays were conducted as described previously (14).
Brieﬂy, NME cells, unstimulated (pre-EMT) or stimulated with

TGFb for 3 days (post-EMT), were treated with the ECO–siRNA
complexes for an additional 2 days. The cells were then trypsinized and their ability to invade reconstituted basement membranes (5  104 cells/well) was measured using modiﬁed Boyden
chambers, as previously described (18). For the proliferation
assay, the NME cells were cultured (1  104 cells/well) in the
presence (post-EMT) or absence (pre-EMT) of TGFb (5 ng/mL) for
3 days, and then treated with ECO–siRNA. Cell proliferation
was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation as previously
described (11).
Three-dimensional–organotypic cultures
Three-dimensional (3D)–organotypic cultures using the "ontop" method were performed as described previously (25). NME
or MDA-MB-231 cells, which were unstimulated (pre-EMT) or
stimulated with TGFb (5 ng/mL) for 3 days (post-EMT), were
cultured in 96-well, white-walled, clear bottom tissue culture
plates (2,000 cells/well) with 50 mL of Cultrex cushions (Trevigen)
in media supplemented with 5% Cultrex. The cells were maintained in culture for 4 days with continuous ECO–siRNA treatment every 2 days. Growth was monitored by bright-ﬁeld microscopy or bioluminescent growth assays (where indicated) using
luciferin substrate (26, 27).
Tumor growth and bioluminescent imaging
All the animal studies were performed in accordance with the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for Case Western
Reserve University. NME cells (1  106 cells/mouse) were engineered to stably express ﬁreﬂy luciferase, and were subsequently
injected into the lateral tail vein of 4- to 6-week-old, female
nude mice (nu/nu Balb/c background) after TGFb stimulation
(5 ng/mL) for 7 days. Pulmonary outgrowth was monitored and
determined as described previously (28). MDA-MB-231 cells, also
engineered to express ﬁreﬂy luciferase and stimulated with TGFb
for 7 days, were engrafted into the mammary fat pad of female
nude mice. The primary tumor growth and metastatic burden
were monitored and determined as described above.

lized in 0.1% Triton-X 100, stained with Alexa Flour 488 phalloidin (25 mmol/L; Invitrogen), and visualized under a ﬂuorescent
confocal microscope.
For immunohistochemistry, primary tumor samples were
embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (Tissue-TeK) in preparation for cryostat sectioning and immediately
frozen. The samples were then sectioned, ﬁxed in parafﬁn, and
maintained at 80 C. The samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to evaluate the presence of tumor tissue.
Brieﬂy, the samples were ﬁxed in 10% formalin, rehydrated in
70% ethanol, and rinsed in deionized water before hematoxylin
staining. Samples were then rinsed in tap water, decolorized in
acid alcohol, immersed in lithium carbonate and rinsed again in
tap water. Next, the eosin counterstain was applied and slides were
dehydrated in 100% ethanol, rinsed in Xylene and ﬁnally
mounted on a coverslip with Biomount. For immunoﬂuorescence
detection of ﬁbronectin, the parafﬁn-embedded slides were ﬁrst
deparafﬁnized using a series of washes in xylene and decreasing
concentrations of ethanol. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was
performed using a pressure cooker in sodium citrate buffer (10
mmol/L sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) for 20 minutes.
Following heat-induced antigen retrieval, the samples were
blocked in TBST solution containing donkey serum and washed
three times with TBST. The primary antibody (Abcam) was
applied at dilution of 1:100 in blocking solution for 1 hour

In vivo therapeutic treatment
Tumor-bearing mice were i.v. injected with RGD- or RADmodiﬁed ECO–siRNA nanoparticles with an siRNA dose of 1.5
mg/kg every 5 days starting at day 17 after tumor engraftment.
Surface modiﬁed ECO–siRNA nanoparticles (N/P ratio of 7.7)
were prepared directly before each treatment according to the twostep formulation process described above based on the siRNA
dose (1.5 mg/kg siRNA, 18.6 mg/kg ECO, 2.5 mol% PEGylation
of ECO with either RGD- or RAD-functionalized PEG3400-maleimide). Each mouse (25 g body weight) received on average
nanoparticles containing 37.5 mg siRNA, 464 mg ECO, and 47.7 mg
of either RGD-PEG3400-mal or RAD-PEG3400-mal in 150 mL
nuclease-free water at each injection.
Immunoﬂuorescence and immunohistochemical staining
For visualization of the actin cytoskeleton, immunoﬂuorescent
analysis was performed as previously described (14). NME cells
(5  104 cells/well) were plated onto glass-bottom confocal
dishes and allowed to adhere overnight, after which they were
simultaneously stimulated with TGFb (5 ng/mL) and treated with
ECO–siRNA nanoparticles, either sib3 or siNS at 100 nmol/L
siRNA concentration. After 48 and 72 hours of simultaneous
TGFb stimulation and nanoparticle treatment, the cells were
washed with PBS, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabi-

followed by three rinses with TBST. The Alexa Fluor 488 secondary
antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) was applied at a dilution of
1:5,000 in blocking solution for 1 hour followed by three washes
with TBST and counterstained with DAPI at a dilution of 1:2,500
in blocking solution. After washing with TBST and mounting in an
anti-fade mounting solution (Molecular Probes), the samples
were imaged using a confocal microscope.

Statistical analyses
Statistical values were deﬁned using the unpaired Student t test,
with a P value of <0.05 considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
ECO/sib3 nanoparticles induce sustained silencing of b3
integrin
We examined the ability of ECO/b3 integrin-speciﬁc siRNA
nanoparticles (ECO/sib3) to silence b3 integrin expression in
mouse NME breast cancer cells (23, 24), which are reminiscent
of a basal-like breast cancer cell line (24), and human MDA-MB-

231 breast cancer cells, a TNBC cell line (29). The expression of b3
integrin was elevated in both cell lines after stimulation with TGFb
for 72 hours (14). Subsequent treatment of the stimulated cells
with ECO/sib3 nanoparticles resulted in the rapid loss of b3
integrin mRNA within the ﬁrst 16 hours following treatment
(Fig. 1B). b3 integrin expression was reduced by approximately
75% and this downregulation was sustained for up to 7 days in
NME cells treated with TGFb (Fig. 1B and C). ECO/sib3 treatment
of MDA-MB-231 cells reduced b3 integrin expression level to that
of the unstimulated cells (Fig. 1B and D). Importantly, treatment
with ECO/nonspeciﬁc siRNA nanoparticles (ECO/siNS) failed to
alter b3 integrin expression in both cell lines (Fig. 1B–D). Collectively, these results demonstrate the ability of ECO/sib3 nanoparticles to induce efﬁcient and prolonged silencing of b3 integrin
expression in breast cancer cells.

staining of the actin cytoskeletal architecture (18) revealed
that quiescent NME cells displayed the epithelial hallmark of
densely packed and well-organized cortical actin network
(18), whereas those stimulated with TGFb exhibited dissolved
junctional complexes and acquired an elongated morphology
consistent with stress ﬁber formation that are characteristic of
mesenchymal cells (Fig. 2A). Treatment of NME cells with
ECO/sib3 nanoparticles at the time of TGFb stimulation
inhibited dissolution of the junctional complexes and stress
ﬁber formation, whereas treatment with ECO/siNS nanoparticles failed to affect TGFb-induced morphologic changes
(Fig. 2A). Moreover, the phenotypic changes in post-EMT
cells were accompanied by alterations in the expression of
EMT-related genes (30). Silencing of b3 integrin with ECO/
sib3 nanoparticles signiﬁcantly reduced TGFb-mediated upregulation of the mesenchymal markers, N-cad and PAI-1, and
inhibited TGFb-mediated downregulation of the epithelial
markers, E-cad and CK-19 (Fig. 2B and C). ECO/siNS nanoparticles did not alter the effect of TGFb on the aforementioned EMT markers.
TGFb-mediated EMT is also associated with increased invasiveness (10, 30) and cell-cycle arrest (31). TGFb-stimulated
NME cells treated with ECO/siNS readily invaded reconstituted
basement membrane, whereas ECO/sib3 nanoparticles significantly inhibited invasion (Fig. 2D). Conversely, treatment of
quiescent NME cells with ECO/sib3 nanoparticles had no effect
on basal invasiveness, an event that is uncoupled from b3
integrin expression. Previous studies demonstrate that parental
NMuMG cells readily undergo proliferative arrest when stimulated with TGFb (31). We found that the NME cells override
these cytostatic effects of TGFb (Fig. 2E), whereas treatment
with ECO/sib3 partially restores TGFb-mediated cytostasis
(Fig. 2E). Collectively, these ﬁndings indicate that ECO/sib3
nanoparticle-mediated silencing of b3 integrin attenuates TGFbinduced EMT and invasion, and partially restores TGFb-mediated
cytostasis.
ECO/sib3 nanoparticles attenuate outgrowth of murine and
human MECs in 3D-organotypic culture
To study the effects of ECO/sib3 nanoparticles in a physiologically relevant system, we cultured NME and MDA-MB231 cells in 3D-organotypic cultures to recapitulate the elastic
modulus of a distant metastatic site such as the pulmonary
microenvironment (32). This culture method presented additional obstacles in the delivery and uptake of nanoparticles,
because these organoids were compact and surrounded by a
dense matrix. Using confocal microscopy, we conﬁrmed that
ECO–siRNA nanoparticles formulated with ﬂuorescently
labeled siRNA (AF-488) readily gained access to NME organoids by ﬁrst penetrating into the periphery within 30 minutes
after treatment, and further dispersing throughout the entirety
of the organoid to reach a near-uniform distribution within 24
hours (Fig. 3A). The dispersion of ECO–siRNA nanoparticles
into the inner cell layers of the organoids suggests that ECO–
siRNA uptake by these cells may result from diffusion through
intercellular spaces or through transcytosis (33). Fig. 3B and C
show that NME and MDA-MB-231 organoids stimulated with
TGFb exhibited increased growth as compared with their
quiescent counterparts. Treatment with ECO–sib3 nanoparticles inhibited the growth of both quiescent and TGFb-stimulated NME and MDA-MB-231 organoids (Fig. 3B and C) in

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of ECO/sib3 nanoparticles in attenuating the 3D outgrowth of post-EMT breast
cancer cells.
Surface modiﬁcation of ECO–siRNA nanoparticles with RGD
peptide promotes cellular uptake and sustains gene silencing
An essential goal of in vivo siRNA delivery is to increase
siRNA localization at the disease site while minimizing its
accumulation in nontarget tissues (34). We modiﬁed ECO–
siRNA nanoparticles with a cyclic RGD peptide, which binds
to avb3 integrin, or a nontargeting control cyclic RAD peptide
via PEG spacers (3,400 Da; Fig. 4A and B; refs. 22, 31). The
size of RGD-modiﬁed ECO–siRNA nanoparticles (RGD–ECO–
siRNA) was 88.3  5.2 nm, as determined by DLS (Fig. 4C).
Their cellular uptake was then examined in both unstimulated
and TGFb-stimulated NME cells. TGFb stimulation had no
effect on the cellular uptake of unmodiﬁed ECO–siRNA nanoparticles, whereas cellular uptake of RGD–ECO–siRNA nanoparticles was robustly enhanced (Fig. 4D and E), leading to
effective silencing of b3 integrin in TGFb-treated cells (Fig. 4F
and G). Because avb3 is a major receptor that recognizes the
RGD-targeting peptide, we sought to determine whether b3
integrin silencing affects cellular uptake of RGD–ECO–siRNA
nanoparticles. Although cellular uptake of RGD-targeted nanoparticles was diminished upon b3 integrin silencing, uptake
was nonetheless elevated consistently, because of the presence

ECO–siRNA nanoparticles with RGD-targeted PEG ligand via thiol-maleimide chemistry. B, conjugation of RGD-PEG-maleimide to ECO was conﬁrmed from
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The center of the bell was observed at m/z 5200, conﬁrming the conjugation of RGD-PEG-maleimide (m/z, 4100) to ECO [m/z, 1046

treated with ECO nanoparticles with Alexa Fluor 488–labeled siRNA at 40 nmol/L siRNA for 4 hours. NME cells that were stimulated with TGFb exhibited a higher
cellular uptake of RGD-targeted ECO–siRNA nanoparticles compared with the nontargeted ECO–siRNA nanoparticles as conﬁrmed by confocal microscopy
(scale bar, 50 mm; D) and quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry (n ¼ 3;   , P  0.01; E). Quantitative analysis of b3 integrin mRNA levels following treatment with sib3

H, cellular uptake in NME cells, both with and without TGFb stimulation (5 ng/mL; 72 hours), was quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry for RGD–ECO–siRNA nanoparticles
containing Alexa Fluor 488–labeled siRNA 4 hours after treatment. One group of TGFb-stimulated NME cells (TGFb þ ECO/sib3) was treated with ECO/sib3
nanoparticles at 100 nmol/L siRNA for 48 hours before cellular uptake with the RGD-targeted nanoparticles to quantify the effect of b3 integrin silencing on

together, these results show that RGD-targeted ECO–siRNA
nanoparticles efﬁciently promote cellular uptake and robust
gene silencing, particularly in post-EMT and metastatic breast
cancer cells.

nanoparticles dramatically inhibited pulmonary outgrowth of
post-EMT NME cells (Fig. 5), as compared with nonspeciﬁc
RAD–ECO/sib3 and RGD–ECO/siNS treatment groups. These
results demonstrate that RGD-targeted ECO/sib3 nanoparticles
with PEG spacers can effectively inhibit pulmonary outgrowth
of TGFb-stimulated NME cells, when targeted for in vivo delivery applications.
RGD–ECO/sib3 nanoparticles effectively inhibit primary
tumor growth and metastasis of malignant human MECs
To further evaluate the in vivo effect of our targeted ECO/sib3
nanoparticles, MDA-MB-231 cells pretreated with TGFb were
engrafted into the mammary fat pad of nude mice. Mice were
treated with RGD–ECO/sib3 (1.5 mg/kg siRNA, 18.6 mg/kg ECO)
every 5 days, starting at day 17 (Fig. 6A). Primary tumor burden
was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and caliper
measurements. Compared with the untreated control, RGD–
ECO/siNS or RAD–ECO/sib3 treatment groups, RGD–ECO/
sib3–treated mice exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced primary tumor
burden (Fig. 6B–D). The primary tumors were resected at week 9
(Fig. 6A) and weighed. Figure 6E shows that RGD–ECO/sib3
treatment resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced tumor weights as
compared with the control groups. Importantly, the therapeutic
efﬁcacy of RGD–ECO/sib3 was reﬂected by decreased mRNA
expression of b3 integrin in the primary tumors, relative to that
in the control groups (Fig. 6F). RAD–ECO/sib3 treatment resulted
in marginally reduced b3 integrin expression (Fig. 6F), which was
consistent with the marginally reduced primary tumor burden,
which were not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig 6D and E). These data

uted to tumor vascular hyperpermeability. H&E staining of tissue
sections demonstrated similar histopathologic patterns in
RGD–ECO/sib3-treated and control groups, whereas untreated
mice developed tumors that were more vascularized than
RGD–ECO/sib3–treated tumors (Fig. 6G). Further immunostaining of tissue sections indicated that RGD–ECO/sib3–treated primary tumors exhibited decreased expression of a mesenchymal marker, ﬁbronectin (Fig. 6H), which is associated
with poor overall survival (36).
RGD–ECO/sib3 treatment resulted in robust inhibition of
tumor metastases (Fig. 7A and C) and primary tumor recurrence
(Fig. 7B), as compared with control groups at week 12 after
engraftment. Primary tumor recurrence was evaluated by restricting the region of interest of the bioluminescent image to that of
the area originally occupied by the resected primary tumor.
Interestingly, RAD–ECO/sib3 treatment also mediated signiﬁcant
inhibition of tumor metastases and primary tumor recurrence as
compared with RGD–ECO/siNS treatment, but to a lesser extent
than RGD–ECO/sib3. This decrease in the efﬁcacy of RAD–ECO/
sib3 could be attributed to the lack of speciﬁc targeting and
binding of the nanoparticles to the cancer cells. At 12 weeks after
engraftment, the RGD–ECO/sib3 group was released from nanoparticle treatment to evaluate the lasting effects of therapeutic b3
integrin silencing on tumor recurrence and metastases in comparison with the untreated control group. At 4 weeks after treatment release (16 weeks after engraftment), the RGD–ECO/sib3–
treated mice remained tumor-free, whereas the tumor burden of
untreated mice continued to increase (Fig. 7D and E). Finally,
throughout the entire course of treatment, no signiﬁcant difference was observed in the body weights across the different
treatment groups, demonstrating the low toxicity of the i.v.
administered, targeted, and PEGylated ECO–siRNA nanoparticles
(Fig. 7F). Collectively, these data highlight the effectiveness and
safety of the systemic administration of RGD–ECO/sib3 nanoparticles for the inhibition of TNBC tumor progression and
metastases.

Discussion
Cancer metastasis involves a cascade of events, including EMT
and local invasion, intravasation, survival in circulation, extravasation, and outgrowth of disseminated cells at the secondary site.
Cancer cell EMT is considered to be a critical step for the initiation
of cancer metastasis. To alleviate metastasis, it is essential to
prevent EMT and to eliminate the dissemination and outgrowth
of cells that have already undergone EMT. Silencing EMT-related
genes by RNAi has the potential to revolutionize current treatment
standards. b3 integrin has been implicated as a powerful inducer
of EMT (11, 14), potentiating the oncogenic effects of TGFb by
inducing invasion and metastases of MECs. Here, we demonstrated that silencing the expression of b3 integrin with RGD–ECO/
sib3 nanoparticles prevented TGFb-mediated EMT and inhibited
TNBC metastasis.
Although functional disruption of b3 integrin has been shown
to attenuate TGFb-mediated EMT and tumor progression (11, 14),
the utilization of b3 integrin siRNA as a therapeutic regimen has
been limited because of the lack of a clinically feasible approach.
In the present study, we demonstrated ECO to be a versatile, safe,
and effective siRNA delivery vehicle that forms stable RGD-targeted siRNA nanoparticles for systemic siRNA delivery, which
silenced b3 integrin expression, and subsequently eliminated

post-EMT cells responsible for metastases. The inhibition of
TGFb-mediated EMT with ECO/sib3 nanoparticles was evident
by the obstruction of TGFb-mediated morphologic changes,
downregulation of epithelial markers, and upregulation of mesenchymal markers in vitro. Moreover, silencing b3 integrin also
decreased invasiveness and reduced outgrowth of breast cancer
cells in 3D culture and in vivo. The effectiveness of RGD-targeted
ECO/sib3 nanoparticles for treating metastatic TNBC was evident
by reduced primary tumor burden in tumors with diminished
expression of b3 integrin. More importantly, ECO/sib3 treatment
abrogated metastases and primary tumor recurrence after treatment release.
Several unique features of ECO and ECO–siRNA nanoparticles render the delivery system effective for safe and systemic
delivery of a therapeutic siRNA in treating metastatic TNBC.
ECO possesses pH-sensitive amphiphilicity, which is essential
to promote endo-lysosomal escape and avoid lysosomal siRNA
degradation. The amino groups within ECO become protonated when exposed to the increasingly acidic environment of
the endo-lysosomes, thereby increasing the cationic charge of

www.aacrjournals.org

the nanoparticles to promote endo-lysosomal membrane
fusion for escape. Thiol groups of the cysteine residues are
autoxidized into disulﬁde bridges during nanoparticle formulation, which stabilize the nanoparticles during circulation and
become reduced by cytosolic glutathione, resulting in siRNA
release from ECO to initiate RNAi in cytoplasm (17). The thiol
groups also facilitate surface modiﬁcation of ECO–siRNA
nanoparticles with PEG or targeting peptides. This modiﬁcation
enables targeted in vivo siRNA delivery into tumor tissues and
minimizes potential toxic side effects. This multifunctionality
uniquely resides within a simple small molecular lipid, making
ECO a versatile carrier for highly efﬁcient cytosolic siRNA
delivery. The formation of targeted ECO–siRNA nanoparticles
is straightforward and reproducible, and can be readily scaledup for clinical development.
We demonstrated that b3 integrin is a powerful therapeutic
target for treating metastatic TNBC, and that RGD–ECO/sib3
nanoparticles are an effective vehicle to systemically silence b3
integrin in post-EMT cancer cells. Speciﬁcally, RGD–ECO/sib3
may be beneﬁcial for TNBC patients who currently lack targeted

treatments. Administering RGD–ECO/sib3 nanoparticles in
combination with chemotherapy also has the potential to
resensitize drug-resistant TNBC cells to chemotherapy. Moreover, avb3 integrin is highly expressed in the angiogenic
vasculature of many cancer types, and the RGD peptide is a
well-established strategy for honing the delivery of therapeutics
to the tumor (37–39). These studies highlight the potential of
our RGD–ECO/sib3 regimen in targeting not only the primary
tumor, but also endothelial cells in angiogenic tumor vasculature for treating breast cancer. However, b3 integrin silencing
may cause potential side effects in wound healing (10), which
remain to be addressed. The effectiveness of ECO/sib3 for
treating established metastatic lesions and some types of TNBC
without elevated expression of b3 integrin is not clear and
needs further investigation. Previous studies suggest that established metastatic breast lesions use b1 integrin to sustain
outgrowth (40, 41), which we currently hypothesize to limit
the effectiveness of our RGD–ECO/sib3 regimen in the treatment of late stage metastatic breast cancer. Because of the
versatility of our multifunctional ECO–siRNA nanoparticles,
targeted nanoparticles with different targeting ligands and
siRNAs, including b1 integrin siRNA, can be readily formulated
to address this issue. We are currently exploring the effectiveness of dual b1 and b3 integrin targeting using our ECO–siRNA
nanoparticles (14). In summary, silencing of b3 integrin
expression with our targeted multifunctional ECO/sib3 nanoparticles is a promising therapeutic strategy for the effective
treatment of metastatic TNBC associated with elevated b3
integrin.
