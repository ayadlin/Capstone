Abstract
Transforming growth factor B1 (TGFB) is a tumor suppressor
during the initial stage of tumorigenesis, but it can switch to
a tumor promoter during neoplastic progression. Ionizing
radiation (IR), both a carcinogen and a therapeutic agent,
induces TGFB activation in vivo. We now show that IR
sensitizes human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) to
undergo TGFB-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT). Nonmalignant HMEC (MCF10A, HMT3522 S1, and
184v) were irradiated with 2 Gy shortly after attachment in
monolayer culture or treated with a low concentration of
TGFB (0.4 ng/mL) or double treated. All double-treated (IR +
TGFB) HMEC underwent a morphologic shift from cuboidal
to spindle shaped. This phenotype was accompanied by a
decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin, Bcatenin, and ZO-1, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, and
increased expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin,
fibronectin, and vimentin. Furthermore, double treatment
increased cell motility, promoted invasion, and disrupted
acinar morphogenesis of cells subsequently plated in Matrigel.
Neither radiation nor TGFB alone elicited EMT, although IR
increased chronic TGFB signaling and activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that double-treated cells exhibit a
specific 10-gene signature associated with Erk/mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. We hypothesized
that IR-induced MAPK activation primes nonmalignant HMEC
to undergo TGFB-mediated EMT. Consistent with this, Erk
phosphorylation was transiently induced by irradiation and
persisted in irradiated cells treated with TGFB, and treatment
with U0126, a MAP/Erk kinase (MEK) inhibitor, blocked the
EMT phenotype. Together, these data show that the interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways elicit
heritable phenotypes that could contribute to neoplastic
progression. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8662–70]

Introduction
An emerging concept in cancer biology is that carcinogens can
compromise tissue integrity by eliciting altered phenotypes and
tissue composition (reviewed in ref. 1). Intercellular and extracellular signals are critical to the suppression of neoplastic growth,
whereas disruption of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions is

implicated, if not required, for neoplastic progression. Indeed,
reversion of the malignant phenotype by modulating extracellular
signals suggests that cancer cells are susceptible to signals from the
microenvironment (2).
We have postulated that ionizing radiation (IR) alters cell
phenotypes, which in turn contribute, directly or indirectly, to
carcinogenesis (3). IR activates multiple signaling pathways depending on the cell type, radiation dose, and cell status (reviewed in
ref. 4). IR also affects the activity or abundance of proteases, growth
factors, cytokines, and adhesion proteins that are involved in tissue
remodeling (reviewed in ref. 5). We have shown that transforming growth factor h1 (TGFh) is activated following IR, and that it,
in turn, mediates cellular and tissue radiation responses (6, 7).
Although TGFh is considered to be a potent tumor suppressor during
the initial stage of tumorigenesis, principally through its ability
to cause growth arrest and apoptosis, numerous reports show that
TGFh can switch to tumor promoter during neoplastic progression
(reviewed in ref. 8). We have shown that the progeny of irradiated
nonmalignant human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) cultured
with TGFh exhibit compromised morphogenesis, polarity, and growth
control when cultured in reconstituted basement membrane (9).
Some epithelial tumors, particularly those that overexpress
TGFh (10), exhibit mesenchymal characteristics and are more
aggressive. Several lines of evidence have led researchers to link
this morphologic shift during carcinogenesis to the physiologic
process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is
characterized by loss of epithelial cell polarity, loss of cell-cell
contacts, and acquisition of mesenchymal markers and phenotypic
traits that include increased cell motility (reviewed in ref. 11).
Although the clinical relevance of EMT in late-stage tumor
progression is controversial, it is generally agreed that EMT can
occur during cancer progression (11). Approximately 18% of breast
cancers exhibit evidence of EMT (12). EMT has recently been
reported during tumor recurrence after therapy (13). TGFh has
been particularly targeted as a mediator of EMT during neoplastic
progression, but analysis of normal epithelial and cancer cell lines
showed that TGFh alone rarely induces EMT (14).
In the present studies, we found that a single exposure to IR
sensitizes HMEC to undergo TGFh-mediated EMT and exhibit all
the classic hallmarks of EMT. Neither irradiation nor TGFh alone
was sufficient to elicit EMT, although TGFh activity was elevated in
irradiated cells. Gene expression profiling revealed a specific
signature in double-treated cells associated with mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. As previously reported, IR
induces transient activation of the MAPK pathway, but exposure
to low concentrations of TGFh maintains this pathway activity,
which is required for maintenance of EMT. We postulate that the
pathway signaling interactions between radiation-induced MAPK
and TGFh elicit the heritable EMT phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HMEC were cultured in serum-free medium as previously
described for HMT-3522 S1 (S1; passages 55–60; ref. 15), MCF10A (American
Type Culture Collection), 184 HMEC (184v; passage 7–10; ref. 16) and HMT3522-S2 (S2; ref. 17). About 0.4 ng/mL of recombinant human TGFh (R&D
Systems) was added at the time of plating or of irradiation. HMEC were
irradiated 4 to 5 h (S1, MCF10A and S2) or 10 to 14 h (184v HMEC) postplating using either 160 kV X-ray or 60Co g-radiation with a total dose of

2 Gy. Control plates were sham irradiated. In some experiments, the
medium was supplemented with 10 Ag/mL TGFh pan-specific neutralizing
antibody (R&D Systems) or with an equivalent concentration of nonspecific
mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG). When noted, some cultures were treated
with 10 Am U0126 (Cell Signaling) or DMSO.
Reagents. Antibodies to phosphorylated Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), phosphorylated MAP/Erk kinase (MEK; Ser217/221), Erk1/2 and MEK1/2 were
from Cell Signaling. Phalloidin was from Molecular Probes. E-cadherin,
h-catenin, and N-cadherin antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences,
and vimentin-clone VIM 13.2, h-actin, and fibronectin antibodies were from
Sigma. ZO-1 antibody was obtained from Zymed. SMAD2/3 antibody was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were grown on LabTek eight-well chamber
slides, fixed with 80% methanol for 10 min (N-cadherin, ZO-1) or methanol/
acetone (vimentin, h-catenin) or 4% paraformaldehyde ( fibronectin,
SMAD3, phalloidin), followed by treatment with 0.1% Triton (N-cadherin,
SMAD3) for 10 min. For E-cadherin staining, cells were either fixed with 80%
methanol or extracted with CSK buffer (15), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde fixation. Nuclei were counterstained with 0.5 ng/mL 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI).
TGFB bioassay. Mink lung cells transfected with the plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 promoter/luciferase (PAI-L) reporter were used to
analyze TGFh in the conditioned media as previously reported (18).
Protein analysis. Cells were lysed as previously described (15) or in
buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH, 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
0.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor
mixture (20 AL/mL; Sigma), 1 mmol/L Pefabloc, and 50 mmol/L glycerol-2phosphate (Sigma) or phosphatase inhibitor cocktail set II (Calbiochem).
Extraction and immunoprecipitation of soluble and insoluble pools of
E-cadherin were done as previously described (19). Proteins were separated
on 4% to 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) or
nitrocellulose (Amersham Life Science) and probed with indicated primary
antibodies. In some instances, detection was accomplished using chemiluminescence of secondary antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase
followed by densitometry analysis of films. Alternatively, detection was done
using the Odyssey system (LI-COR) as previously described (20). Target
proteins were normalized to h-actin for loading.
Motility and invasion assays. Confluent HMT3522 S1 or MCF10A
cultures were grown in medium containing epidermal growth factor (EGF).
The cultures were scratched with a pipette tip and washed to remove
detached cells. The invasion assay was done as previously described (21).
The number of invading cells was the average of three wells from two
duplicate experiments.
RNA purification. Cells were washed with PBS, denatured in TRIzol,
scraped, and subjected to chloroform extraction. After centrifugation, the
upper phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. RNA
precipitates were resuspended in RNase-free water and further purified on
RNeasy columns (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The data set analyzed by microarray included biological
duplicates for each treatment in two independent experiments and three
sham-treated samples.
Microarray processing and analysis. Microarray data were generated
at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Molecular Profiling
Laboratory1 using a high-throughput, automated GeneChip system
(Affymetrix). Briefly, target preparation, HT_HG-U133A array plate hybridization setup, washing and staining were done on an Affymetrix robotic
system (GCAS) using version 2.1 protocols. Scanning (protocol version
2.2.09) was done using a CCD-based high-throughput scanner (Affymetrix).
Samples were analyzed and clustered with the (UNO) One Color Genetraffic
software version 3.2-12 (Iobion Informatics LLC, Stratagene). Genes whose
expression was specifically altered by treatment were defined as those in
which the dye ratio was more than 1.75-fold (|mean log2 ratio| > 0.8) from
baseline in at least three out of the four treated samples compared with the

three sham samples. Significance analysis tests (P < 0.05) were done using
Excel between sham samples and either IR, TGFh, or TGFh + IR samples.
Microarray data can be accessed as series GSE8240 in the National Center
for Biotechnology Information/GEO database.2
Real-time PCR. Total RNAs were pretreated with amplification grade
DNase I (Invitrogen) and then primed with random hexamers to generate
cDNAs using a Superscript III first-strand synthesis kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). About 1 AL of nondiluted cDNAs
was then amplified with Lightcycler FastStart DNA master SYBR Green I
(Roche Applied Science) using a Light Cycler (Roche Applied Science).
TCF8, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and CDH1 specific primers
optimized for SYBR Green real-time PCR were purchased from SuperArray
Bioscience Corporation.
Image acquisition, processing, and analysis. Imaging was done as
previously described (20). Colony segmentation from phase images was
done using live wire tool from Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and
Visualization (MIPAV; ref. 22). Area and shape factors were calculated using
Matlab (MathWorks Inc.) and DIPimage (image processing toolbox for
Matlab, Delft University of Technology).

Results
The progeny of irradiated HMEC undergoes EMT in
response to TGFB. We previously reported that E-cadherin
immunofluorescence significantly decreased in double-treated (IR +
TGFh) HMT3522 S1 cultured in Matrigel compared with control or
single-treated cells and failed to establish acinar morphology typical
of HMEC (9). EMT is one means of disrupting morphogenesis,
e.g., during wound healing. To examine the possibility that EMT
underlies the response to radiation and TGFh, we compared the
epithelial characteristics of HMEC in traditional monolayer culture.
HMEC were irradiated with 2 Gy shortly after attachment or treated
with low concentrations of TGFh (400 pg/mL), or double treated,
and cultured to f80% confluence. As observed previously, E-cadherin
and h-catenin immunolocalization in monolayer HMEC was
significantly reduced in double-treated cells (Fig. 1A). The function
of an epithelium as a barrier requires the establishment of tight
junctions, evident by lateral, apical localization of ZO-1. ZO-1
immunofluorescence showed distinct punctate localization at cell
borders of control and irradiated cells. TGFh treatment somewhat
altered ZO-1 staining, such that it appeared as a coarser, punctate-like
pattern at the cell boundaries (Fig. 1A). However, ZO-1 staining
completely disappeared in double-treated cells.
Notably, double treatment resulted in spindle-shaped, elongated
cells, a phenotype which was examined by phalloidin staining of
actin. Actin localized mainly at cell-cell borders of control and
irradiated HMEC with very few stress fibers. TGFh alone elicited a
mild change in actin organization. Double-treated cells displayed
dramatic actin reorganization consisting of longitudinal stress
fibers, characteristic of fibroblasts (Fig. 1A).
In light of the loss of epithelial markers in irradiated HMEC
cultured with TGFh, we investigated whether there was a
concomitant gain of mesenchymal markers, fibronectin, vimentin,
and N-cadherin (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence analysis of the
double-treated group revealed increased fibronectin deposition
compared with sham and single-treated cells. Accumulated
fibronectin was arrayed perpendicular to the cell edge and in
randomly oriented networks. The intermediate filament protein
vimentin dramatically increased following double treatment.
Consistent with the shift to an elongated morphology, vimentin

filaments were organized in a longitudinal meshwork. N-cadherin
is normally present mainly in neuronal and muscle tissues, but is
aberrantly expressed in epithelial tumors where it has been proposed
to promote migration and invasiveness of carcinoma cells (23).
N-cadherin immunofluorescence was dramatically increased following double treatment in a pattern reciprocal to E-cadherin loss.
Loss of epithelial markers and gain of mesenchymal markers in
double-treated cells were accompanied by epithelial to mesenchymal cell shape change. Phase microscopy of 184v HMEC (Fig. 1C),
HMT3522 S1, and MCF10A (data not shown) showed that
untreated HMEC and irradiated cells displayed typical cuboidal
appearance of epithelial cells. TGFh elicited a modest shape
change. In contrast, the morphology of all three HMEC following
double treatment shifted to spindle shaped. The morphologic
response was observed even when TGFh was added 48 h post-IR
and was not reversible upon removal of TGFh from the culture
media for 48 h (data not shown). Taken together, the concomitant
increased expression of mesenchymal markers, loss of epithelial
markers, and morphologic response of the progeny of irradiated
HMEC to TGFh suggest that cells have undergone EMT.
TGFB alters the cytoskeletal associated E-cadherin/B-catenin
complexes in irradiated HMEC. Although E-cadherin immunofluorescence was significantly reduced only in double-treated cells
(Fig. 1A), Western blot analysis of total E-cadherin protein
expression levels were comparable in TGFh-treated and doubletreated groups (Fig. 2A). h-Catenin protein levels followed the

same pattern. This observation suggested that immunofluorescence
was a function of protein localization rather than abundance. In
epithelial cells, E-cadherin and h-catenin are associated with the
cytoskeleton at intercellular junctions that are resistant to detergent
extraction (24). We tested whether the difference between immunofluorescence and immunoblotting was due to solubility by using
differential detergent extraction followed by E-cadherin immunoprecipitation. Although TGFh reduced the soluble pool of E-cadherin
regardless of irradiation, the insoluble, cytoskeletal associated
E-cadherin was significantly decreased only in double-treated cells
(Fig. 2B). The distribution of h-catenin was similarly affected. Thus,
TGFh alters the cytoskeletal associated E-cadherin/h-catenin
complexes only in irradiated HMEC.
Functional consequence of the response of irradiated HMEC
to TGFB. During physiologic processes and in cancer, EMT is often
accompanied by the acquisition of cell motility and invasiveness
(11). We analyzed the migratory properties of double-treated
HMEC using a monolayer scratch assay and time-lapse videomicroscopy (Fig. 3A). Control or irradiated cells moved as a sheet
as evidenced by a smooth edge and failed to fill the gap during the

40-h observation period. Consistent with their intermediate
cytoskeletal and cell-cell adhesion phenotype, TGFh-treated HMEC
began to close the wound after 20 h, but the cells still maintained
sheet formation and, by 40 h, had not closed the gap. In contrast,
irradiated HMEC cultured with TGFh moved as single, spindleshaped cells and closed the gap by 40 h by forming multicellular
bridges of spindle-shaped cells between the two areas. Thus, the
tissue-specific requirement for epithelia to maintain cell interactions as a sheet of cohesive cells is disrupted when irradiated
HMEC are exposed to TGFh, which leads to the independent single
cell migration characteristic of mesenchymal cells.
The above observations led us to further investigate the invasive
properties of HMEC by invasion assay through a membrane coated
with Matrigel, a basement membrane-type matrix. HMT 3522 S1
did not invade in this assay under any condition. Therefore, we
used HMT 3522 S2, which are derived from further propagation of
HMT 3522 S1 in EGF-free media (21). Cells were cultured as
described above and then trypsinized and plated into the Boyden
chamber assay in standard media. Few control HMT 3522 S2 cells
were able to invade. The progeny of irradiated cells showed greater

cells. Representative images captured with a 10 objective at the time of wounding (0 h) and 20 or 40 h after wounding. All experiments were repeated at least
thrice with similar results. B, quantification of Transwell migration assay using HMT3522 S2 cells. Columns, mean of total cell counts of each well from duplicate

TGFh-treated or double-treated MCF10A were grown to 80% to 90% confluency, trypsinized, and embedded in Matrigel as previously described (9). Phase images
of acini embedded in Matrigel were captured using 10 magnification. Acini were identified using the live wire tool from MIPAV and batch processed by in-house
measurement routines (see Materials and Methods for details). Three separate experiments with multiple independent samples were analyzed. Averages of acini areas
were plotted against their average shape factor for each sample. The shape factor is defined as P 2/(4pA), where P is the perimeter and A is the area of the acinus.
This value is equal to 1 for a perfect circle. A value of >1 is interpreted as the amount of deformation in comparison to a circle. Averages of acini areas were
plotted against their average shape factor for each sample. A P value of 1.8E 5 was obtained between sham and double treatment. All other groups could not be
distinguished from sham. The circles on the scatterplot delimit the double-treated group compared with the other groups and indicate that double treatment leads to
larger and more deformed acini. Statistical analysis of the two-dimensional scatterplot between area and shape factor was done using multivariate ANOVA (50).

invasion than treatment with TGFh alone when compared with the
control. In contrast, irradiation of S2 cells and subsequent culture
in the presence of TGFh increased the number of invading cells to
more than 100-fold compared with sham (Fig. 3B).
There is ongoing discussion in the literature as to what criteria
define true EMT in vitro and how to distinguish the EMT phenotype
from a scattering phenotype (11). Both phenotypes exhibit
disruption of cell junctions, fibroblast-type morphology, and
enhanced motility. However, it has been suggested that they can
be distinguished by reversibility because the EMT phenotype, but
not the scattering phenotype, persists after withdrawal of the
stimulus (11). As mentioned above, TGFh withdrawal did not
reverse the morphologic shift, consistent with EMT. Because the
progeny of irradiated HMEC cultured with TGFh exhibits disrupted
morphogenesis in Matrigel (9), we used morphogenesis as a
stringent test of persistence. Single- and double-treated HMEC
cells were trypsinized and replated in Matrigel for analysis of
acinar morphogenesis without further TGFh stimulation. Replated
double-treated cells formed larger colonies than control or singletreated cells, which was measured by increased size and irregularity
of colony shape (Fig. 3C). We concluded that the phenotype elicited
by IR and TGFh resulting in dysplastic morphogenesis (i.e., threedimensional growth deregulation and disorganization) and the
persistence of these morphologic alterations in the absence of
additional TGFh is further evidence of EMT.
Irradiated HMEC produce active TGFB. Latent TGFh is
activated in the irradiated mouse mammary gland in vivo (6),
which could increase the susceptibility of irradiated cells to
undergo TGFh-mediated EMT by decreasing a threshold response.
Nuclear translocation of receptor-phosphorylated SMAD2 or
SMAD3 (R-SMAD) results from liganded TGFh receptor (8).
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that R-SMAD nuclear
localization increased by 30% in irradiated HMEC 6 days after
irradiation compared with control cells (Fig. 4A). These data
suggest that IR elicits persistent TGFh signaling. To determine
whether IR increased TGFh production or activation, we analyzed
the conditioned medium (CM) from irradiated cells using a TGFh
bioassay (18). Bioassay of irradiated and control HMEC CM
indicated similar levels of latent TGFh. Active TGFh, however, was
undetectable in either CM (data not shown). Because the
sensitivity of detection in CM for the bioassay is f0.2 ng/mL, we
reasoned that low levels of TGFh could be functional, although
undetectable by bioassay. If so, then the CM should give rise to a
similar phenotype in unirradiated HMEC seen in response to the
addition of exogenous TGFh. To investigate this hypothesis, we fed
nonirradiated HMEC with 50% CM from either irradiated or
nonirradiated HMEC cultures. CM from irradiated cells caused a
significant decrease in E-cadherin protein levels when compared
with cells treated with CM from nonirradiated cells. This response
was reversed by adding TGFh neutralizing antibody to the cells
grown in the presence of IR-treated CM (Fig. 4B). To confirm that
this biological activity produced by irradiated cells was indeed
TGFh, irradiated cells were grown in the absence or presence of
TGFh neutralizing antibody. When irradiated HMEC were grown in
the presence of TGFh neutralizing antibody, there was a significant
reversal of the decrease in E-cadherin protein abundance
compared with cells grown with control IgG control antibody
(Fig. 4C).
Based on the above data, we estimated that irradiated cultures
produce f100 pg/mL of active TGFh. We then tested whether
EMT was a function of the additive effect of exogenous (400 pg/mL)

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

and endogenous TGFh (f100 pg/mL) by treating HMEC with
graded concentrations of TGFh. However, MCF10A treated with up
to 1,200 pg/mL TGFh did not undergo EMT (data not shown).
Although IR induced TGFh activity in cultured HMEC as it did in

the mouse mammary gland (6), it was insufficient to disrupt HMEC
acinar morphogenesis as shown in our previous study (9). Moreover,
the progeny of irradiated HMT 3522 S1, MCF10A, and 184v HMEC
exhibited a modest response in terms of epithelial morphology,
E-cadherin expression, or invasion. Thus, chronic TGFh activation
by irradiated HMEC is insufficient to drive the EMT phenotype.
Genetic programs underlying EMT in double-treated HMEC.
To comprehensively describe the altered epithelial cell phenotype
following double treatment, we compared transcript expression
levels in sham, IR-, TGFh-, and double-treated HMEC. The expression profile of the progeny of irradiated HMEC was similar to control HMEC. A total of 43 genes were differentially expressed by
TGFh-treated HMEC that included 28 up-regulated genes and 15
down-regulated genes, with a >1.75-fold change in expression
compared with sham samples (Supplementary Table). We identified
10 genes that constituted the double treatment signature. Expression was significantly increased for five genes and decreased for the
five other genes after double treatment compared with TGFh alone.
The five significantly up-regulated genes in double-treated
samples were the growth factor FGF2/basic fibroblast growth factor,
the serine/cysteine proteinase inhibitor, SERPINA1, the interleukin 1
receptor-like protein, IL1RL1, the transcription factor TCF8/ZEB-1,
and the zinc transporter SLC39A8 (Fig. 5A and B). The five downregulated genes in double-treated HMEC were the Wnt pathway
transcription repressor secreted frizzle-related protein 1 (SFRP1),
the cystein-rich protein, CRIP2, the aldo-keto reductase, AKR1C2, the
cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 2(CELSR2), and
the aminopeptidase O, C9orf3. Although transcript levels of 5 of
these 10 genes (SERPINA1, SLC39A8, CRIP2, AKR1C2, and CELSR2)
were higher in TGFh-treated samples than in sham samples, they
were below the 1.75-fold cutoff used to define TGFh-responsive
genes. Changes in gene expression in double-treated HMEC were
validated for TCF8 and FGF2 by real-time reverse transcription-PCR
(Fig. 5B). For comparison, real-time RT-PCR of E-cadherin (CDH1)
was decreased in both TGFh and double-treated cells, consistent
with the protein levels shown in Fig. 2A.
The EMT signature genes have roles in cell-matrix interactions,
cell motility/invasion, inflammation, and disruption of adherens
junctions. The products of TCF8/ZEB1 and FGF2 have been
described to repress E-cadherin transcription and to promote EMT
(25, 26). Some of the TGFh-responsive and EMT-associated
signature genes identified here have been previously described
(27, 28). An extensive bibliography search showed that 5 of the 10
EMT signature genes are directly or indirectly associated with the
Erk/MAPK pathway, suggesting a specific functional role of Erk/
MAPK activation in inducing EMT upon double treatment. Several
reports suggest that an independent stimulus must synergistically
proceed or at least accompany the induction of EMT. The multiple
downstream effectors of Ras, such as MAPK, may be a requirement
to induce a premalignant state and endow epithelial cells with an
increased rate of proliferation (29).
Persistent activation of Erk/MAPK in double-treated HMEC.
Consequently, we examined the possible involvement of the Erk/
MAPK signaling cascade in the mediation of TGFh-induced EMT
in irradiated HMEC by determining the activation of Erk1/2 and
upstream activators, MEK1/2. The total amounts of Erk or MEK
were similar following all treatments. Phosphorylated-Erk1/2 was
modestly induced by TGFh, but was significantly increased in
irradiated HMEC treated with TGFh (Fig. 6A, top). Consistent with
this, MEK1/2 activation, as indicated by phosphorylation, was also
increased upon double treatment.

significantly (P < 0.05) higher in TGFh-treated samples than in sham samples,
alteration changes were all below the 1.75-fold cutoff used to define
TGFh-responsive genes. The graph represents significance analysis of
alterations in transcript expression levels (FSE) for the 10 EMT signature
genes, including the experiment shown in (A) and a replicate independent
experiment [one probe per gene except for FGF2 (two probes) and SFRP1
(three probes)]. B, validation of microarray profiling for TCF8, FGF2, and CDH1
(E-cadherin) by real-time PCR. Increased TCF8 and FGF2 mRNA abundance
is illustrated by a shift toward the left of the real-time PCR curves in doubletreated samples. CDH1 was decreased (right-shifted curve) in TGFh-treated
and double-treated samples. For each gene, DCt (Ct: point at which the
fluorescence crosses the threshold) values were obtained after subtraction of
the averaged Ct value for sham (n = 3) from the averaged Ct value for each
of the three treatment groups (n = 4). Fold changes for IR, TGFh, and IR +
TGFh–treated samples compared with sham were derived from DCt values
as 2 DCT: 0.99, 0.54, and 0.64 for CDH1 ; 1.07, 1.48, and 2.36 for TCF8 ; 1.04,
1.28, and 2.89 for FGF2 (compared with a value of 1 for sham). Student’s t test:

Cancer Research

There is a significant body of literature that suggests that Erk
activation is required to initiate the EMT program (30, 31). IR can
induce a rapid, ligand-independent activation of Erk/MAPK in
cancer cells (32). To investigate whether activation of Erk1/2 by IR
or TGFh versus double treatment was indeed instrumental in
driving EMT, we monitored MEK/Erk activation at early time
points (4–48 h post-IR). At 8 h, irradiated cells exhibited greater
Erk1/2 activation when compared with TGFh or double treatment.
From 12 to 24 h, MAPK pathway activation increased following IR
or TGFh or double treatment compared with controls. However, at
48 h post-IR, double-treated cells exhibited greater Erk activation
compared with control and to single-treated HMEC (Fig. 6A,
bottom).
To determine if persistent Erk activation was required for the
EMT phenotype in double-treated HMEC, we used U0126, a specific
MEK small-molecule inhibitor. Treatment with U0126 dramatically
decreased Erk activation in HMEC (Fig. 6B). Treatment with U0126
also restored E-cadherin and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Fig. 6C)
and reduced cell migration in the wound closure assay (Fig. 6D).
These data suggest that IR and TGFh collaborate to increase Erk
activation, which is necessary for establishment and maintenance
of EMT (7 days). We propose that transient IR-induced Erk
activation is sustained in the presence of additional TGFh, and that
this event predisposes nonmalignant HMEC to undergo TGFhmediated EMT.

Discussion
Here, we report that the progeny of irradiated HMEC are
dramatically sensitized to undergo TGFh-induced EMT. IR and
TGFh cooperated to induce a phenotypic transition that occurred
in the progeny of cells irradiated once and persisted even in the

absence of TGFh. This resulted in increased motility, enhanced
invasion, and disrupted epithelial morphogenesis and was
accompanied by a distinct pattern of gene expression.
TGFh has long been considered as both a positive and a negative
effector of mammary tumorigenesis, acting early as a tumor suppressor but later as a stimulator of tumor invasion (8). Overexpression of constitutively active TGFh can induce EMT during
tumor progression in vivo (33), and the overexpression of TGFh
has been associated with poor prognosis of many human cancers
(8). The phenotypes of breast cancer micrometastases in lymph
nodes and the bone marrow have been interpreted as evidence that
EMT occurs in primary tumors (34). However, in vivo verification
of EMT has been controversial, perhaps due to the transient and
reversible nature of the process and to the lack of analytic tools
that distinguish carcinoma cells undergoing EMT from neighboring stromal fibroblasts.
In vitro studies of EMT were originally described in cells of
murine origin, frequently containing ras mutations. It has been
reported in a very limited number of human cell lines and very
rarely in nonmalignant cell lines (35, 36). The in vitro studies in
which TGFh alone is capable of inducing EMT have either been
done in serum-containing medium, which provides various growth
factors commonly associated with wounding, including TGFh, FGF,
and EGF, and/or using high TGFh concentrations (2.5–10 ng/mL;
refs. 36, 37). Expression profiling of genetic program underlying
EMT of HaCat keratinocytes stimulated with TGFh to undergo
EMT identified 80 EMT-related targets (27). Our expression
profiling study distinguishes between genes regulated by TGFh
without concomitant EMT in nonmalignant HMEC and genes that
are differentially expressed under conditions resulting in EMT.
We identified 10 genes specifically associated with EMT, five of
which were not induced at all by TGFh alone. Transcriptional

Radiation-Induced EMT

repression of E-cadherin could be mediated by the transcription
factor TCF8/ZEB1 (25). FGF2, whose transcript expression is
significantly increased upon double treatment in this EMT model,
has also been linked to E-cadherin repression and EMT (25, 26).
Low E-cadherin immunoreactivity in breast cancer is associated
with poor prognosis (38), whereas restoration of E-cadherin reverts
the invasive phenotype of cancer cells (39). Irradiated HMEC
redistribute E-cadherin from an insoluble to a soluble pool when
cultured with TGFh, which is accompanied by a significant
increase in N-cadherin. The cadherin switch from E- to N-cadherin
frequently accompanies pronounced tissue reorganization in
normal and pathologic conditions (40). Studies on cancer cell
lines indicate that N-cadherin is linked to a more malignant and
invasive behavior (23). Consistent with this, double-treated HMEC
were significantly more motile. Although double-treated HMT-3522
S1 cells were not invasive, double treatment induced invasive
behavior in HMT-3522 S2 cells, which are an EGF-independent
strain of the HMT-3522 progression series.
Neither chronic TGFh signaling induced by irradiation nor
supplementation with low TGFh concentrations was sufficient to
induce the EMT phenotype in any of the three HMEC that were
examined in our studies. EMT occurred only in irradiated HMEC
in the presence of TGFh, even when TGFh was added 2 days
post-IR. This suggested that a IR-induced event was a prerequisite for TGFh-mediated EMT that was sustained for 48 h. IR
initially induces a transient activation of Erk/MAPK via a ligandindependent mechanism (32). Although the involvement of Erk
signaling in TGFh-induced EMT is controversial (41), many studies
have shown a requirement for overexpression/mutational activation of elements of the Ras/Raf/Erk pathway for TGFh-mediated
EMT (41–43). Furthermore, the importance of enhanced Erk activation in the induction of EMT is also supported by studies in
which Erk activity induced by Ras/TGFh (41), EGF/TGFh (31),
HGF/ErB2 (44), and Akt (45) was found to be critically involved in
EMT. Our data suggest that a model in which IR-induced Erk/
MAPK signaling is sustained by TGFh is required for establishing
and maintaining EMT and is essential for the functional response,
i.e., enhanced migration.
Cancer radiotherapy is primarily limited in many organs by the risk
of developing fibrosis (46). Neilson et al. showed EMT as a significant
source of fibrosis in a kidney ligation model (47). An interesting

implication from our study is that normal epithelia may undergo
EMT in response to irradiation and TGFh, which could contribute to
fibrosis following radiotherapy. If so, this would lend further credence
to the potential application of TGFh inhibitors in radiotherapy.
Based on studies in mouse mammary gland, we proposed that
the action of radiation as a carcinogen is augmented by its ability
to modulate signaling from the microenvironment (48). Tumorigenesis is increased 4-fold when unirradiated preneoplastic
mammary epithelial cells are transplanted to the mammary stroma
of a host irradiated with 4 Gy (3). IR induces abundant TGFh
activation (6). Our current and earlier studies (9) have shown that
irradiated nonmalignant HMEC undergo EMT only if they are
exposed to additional TGFh, as might be derived from the stroma
in intact tissues. If moderate radiation doses can prime preneoplastic cells to undergo EMT, it could accelerate cancer progression. Interestingly, a recent study shows that conventional renal
cell carcinomas of the Ukrainian patients living in the radiationcontaminated areas exhibited significantly higher levels of TGFh
expression compared with similar tumors in populations in
uncontaminated areas (49). These tumors were characterized by
decreased or abnormal distribution of fibronectin, laminin, and
E-cadherin/h-catenin, suggesting that chronic low-level radiation
exposure in humans might indeed shift tumors toward a
mesenchymal phenotype. Nonetheless, there is little evidence to
support these events occurring in normal epithelia in vivo after
moderate doses. Furthermore, additional studies from our
laboratory indicate that TGFh is instrumental in mounting a
DNA damage response (7, 20) and in inducing apoptosis of
genomically unstable cells.3 The complexity of radiation effects
mediated by TGFh will require further study to determine whether
it plays a proximal role in suppressing or promoting radiogenic
carcinogenesis.
