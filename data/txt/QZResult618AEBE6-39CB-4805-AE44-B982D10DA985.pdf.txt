Abstract
Programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) has recently been
shown to be involved in both transcription and translation,
and to regulate cell growth. However, the mechanisms
underlying PDCD4 function are not well understood. In this
study, we show that PDCD4 interacts directly with the
transcription factor Twist1 and leads to reduced cell growth
through the down-regulation of the Twist1 target gene Y-box
binding protein-1 (YB-1). PDCD4 interacts with the DNA
binding domain of Twist1, inhibiting its DNA binding ability
and YB-1 expression. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that an inverse correlation between nuclear PDCD4 and YB-1
expression levels was observed in 37 clinical prostate cancer
specimens. Growth suppression by PDCD4 expression was
completely recovered by either Twist1 or YB-1 expression.
Moreover, PDCD4-overexpressing cells are sensitive to cisplatin and paclitaxel but not to etoposide or 5-fluorouracil. In
summary, PDCD4 negatively regulates YB-1 expression via its
interaction with Twist1 and is involved in cancer cell growth
and chemoresistance. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):3148–56]

Introduction
Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) has been reported to have a
crucial role in various biological activities of cancer cells, such as
cell proliferation and drug resistance (1, 2). YB-1 expression is
closely correlated with an unfavorable clinical outcome (3). We
have previously shown that YB-1 is a major downstream target of
Twist1 and involved in cell growth (4). Twist1 is a basic helix-loophelix transcription factor involved in several pathways that control
cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (5–8). It is also noteworthy that Twist1 is involved in
cancer invasion and metastasis (5–7). We have previously reported
that membrane pulldown assays using glutathione S-transferase
fusion proteins can identify direct molecular interactions, and
identified the direct interaction of Twist1 with p53 (9). In this study,
our results suggest a possible mechanism underlying the tumor
suppressive function of programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4).
PDCD4 is localized to the nucleus, and its expression is induced

during apoptosis (10). PDCD4 interacts with eukaryotic initiation
factor 4A (eIF4A) and inhibits translation (11). Furthermore,
proteolytic degradation of PDCD4 promotes cell growth (12, 13).
PDCD4 suppresses the transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase 1
through up-regulation of p21, resulting in growth suppression (14).
On the other hand, Bitomsky and colleagues (15) reported that in
HeLa cells, down-regulation of PDCD4 lead to increased expression
of p21Waf/Cip1 in a manner of p53-dependent transcription. PDCD4
is thought to play a role in apoptosis (16) and cancer invasion (17),
but its functional role is not fully understood.
Here, we propose another possible function of PDCD4 in the
suppression of cell growth. We found that PDCD4 interacted with
Twist1 and inhibited cell growth via down-regulation of the Twist1
target gene YB-1.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human prostate cancer PC3 cells and human glioma cell
lines were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium and DMEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Stable transfectants
derived from PC3 cells were established as described previously (18).
Briefly, PC3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-YB-1 or pcDNA3-HAPDCD4 and cultured for 2 to 3 wk with selection medium containing
500 Ag/mL neomycin. Isolated colonies were maintained in the presence of
500 Ag/mL neomycin. Cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere
at 37jC.
Antibodies. Antibodies against PDCD4 (sc-27123) and Twist1 (sc-81417)
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-PDCD4 antibody ( for
immunohistochemistry), anti-Flag (M2) antibody, anti-Flag (M2) affinity gel,
and anti–h-actin (AC-15) antibody were purchased from Sigma. Anti–HAperoxidase (3F10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.
Anti–YB-1 antibody was prepared as described previously (19).
Plasmid construction. To obtain the full-length cDNA for PDCD4, PCR
was carried out on a SuperScript cDNA library (Invitrogen) using the
following primer pair: 5¶-ATGGATGTAGAAAATGAGCAGATACTG-3¶ and 5¶TCAGTAGCTCTCTGGTTTAAGACG-3¶. The PCR product was cloned into
the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). To construct pGEX-PDCD4 expressing
GST-PDCD4, the EcoRI fragment of PDCD4 cDNA was ligated into pGEX-4T
vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). For construction of TH-HA-PDCD4 and
pcDNA3-HA-PDCD4, the NH2-terminal HA-tagged PDCD4 cDNA was
ligated into TH vector (19) and pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), respectively.
The construction of GST-Twist1, its deletion mutants (GST-Twist1 N158,
GST-Twist1 N121, GST-Twist1 N117, GST-Twist1 N70, GST-Twist1 N51,
GST-Twist1 N50, and GST-Twist1 112C; see Fig. 1C), pcDNA3-Flag-Twist1,
pcDNA3-Flag-YB-1, pcDNA3-HA-YB-1, pcDNA3-HA-p53, and YB-1-Luc has
been described previously (4, 9, 20).
Western blotting analysis. Western blotting analysis was performed as
described previously (21, 22) with antibodies against PDCD4 (1:1,000),
Twist1 (1:1,000), YB-1 (1:5,000), Flag (M2; 1:5,000), HA (1:5,000), and h-actin

PDCD4 Down-regulates YB-1 Expression
(1:10,000). The expression levels of each protein were assessed numerically
using the NIH Image program, version 1.62 (NIH).
Coimmunoprecipitation assay. Coimmunoprecipitation assays were
performed as described previously (9). Briefly, PC3 cells seeded into 35-mm
tissue culture plates were transfected with the indicated amounts of
HA- and Flag-fused expression plasmids using Superfect reagent (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells were lysed in buffer X containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
1 mmol/L EDTA, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) NP40, 10% (v/v) glycerol,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mmol/L DTT. After
centrifugation at 21,000  g for 10 min, the supernatants (300 Ag) were
incubated for 2 h at 4jC with anti-Flag (M2) affinity gel. Immunoprecipitated samples washed thrice with buffer X, and preimmunoprecipitated
samples (30 Ag) were subjected to Western blotting analysis with an antiFlag antibody and anti-HA antibody as described above. For immunoprecipitation assays without transient transfection, 70%- to 80%-confluent
PC3 cells in 100-mm tissue culture plates were harvested with PBS. After
centrifugation at 500  g for 5 min, cells were resuspended in ice-cold
10 mmol/L HEPES/KOH (pH 7.9), 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA,
0.1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, and 0.5 mmol/L PMSF and lysed by
adding NP40 to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v), and lysates were centrifuged at 500  g for 5 min. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in
ice-cold 20 mmol/L HEPES/KOH (pH 7.9), 0.4 mol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, and 1 mmol/L PMSF, and incubated for
15 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 21,000  g for 10 min at 4jC,
and the supernatants (500 Ag) were incubated for 2 h at 4jC with 2 Ag of
mouse IgG or anti-Twist1 antibody. Immunoprecipitated samples washed
thrice with buffer X, and preimmunoprecipitated samples (50 Ag) were
subjected to Western blotting analysis with an anti-PDCD4 antibody.
GST pulldown assay. Expression of TH-HA-PDCD4 and serial deletion
mutants of GST-Twist1 in bacteria and GST pulldown assays were carried
out as described previously (9). GST-Twist1 and its deletion mutants
immobilized on glutathione-sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare Bio-Science) were
incubated with soluble bacterial extracts containing HA-PDCD4 for 2 h at
4jC in buffer X. Bound samples were washed thrice with buffer X and
subjected to Western blotting analysis with an anti-HA antibody.
Luciferase assay. PC3 cells were cotransfected with 0.5 Ag of YB-1
reporter plasmid and the indicated amounts of expression plasmids using
Superfect reagent (Qiagen); 48 h posttransfection, a luciferase assay was
performed as described previously (21, 22). The results were normalized to
protein concentration measured using the Bradford method, and are
representative of at least three independent experiments.
Knockdown analysis using siRNAs. The commercially generated
(Invitrogen) double-stranded RNA 25-bp oligonucleotides were as follows:
5¶-UUUCAUUCUUUAUUUCCUCAGUCCC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-GGGACUGAGGAAAUAAAGAAUGAAA-3¶ (antisense) for PDCD4 siRNA #1; 5¶-UUAAUUCUAGCUUCGUUAAUGGAGG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CCUCCAUUAACGAAGCUAGAAUUAA-3¶ (antisense) for PDCD4 siRNA #2; 5¶-UUGAGGGUCUGAAUCUUGCUCAGCU-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-AACUGAGCAAGAUUCAGACCCUCAA-3¶ (antisense) for Twist1 siRNA #1; 5¶-UUGAGGGUCUGAAUCUUGCUCAGCU-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-AGCUGAGCAAGAUUCAGACCCUCAA-3¶
(antisense) for Twist1 siRNA #2. PC3 cells (1  106) were transfected with
siRNA as described previously (4). Aliquots of 3  105, 1.5  104, or 3  102
cells were used in EMSAs, cell proliferation assays, or colony formation
assays, respectively, as described below. The remaining cells were seeded in
100-mm dishes with 10 mL of culture medium and harvested after 72 h of
culture for Western blotting analysis as described above.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for the probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
were as follows: human Twist1 oligo, 5¶-GGCCCCCACCATATGGTGCCTGA3¶ (upper), 5¶-GGTCAGGCACCATATGGTGGGGG-3¶ (lower); human nuclear
factor-nB (NFnB) oligo, 5¶-GGAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3¶ (upper),
5¶-GGCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACT-3¶ (lower). Knockdown of Twist1 using
siRNA was carried out as described above. Preparation of 32P-labeled
oligonucleotide probes and EMSAs with purified GST-fusion proteins and
nuclear extracts were performed as described previously (9). Briefly,
oligonucleotides were annealed with their complementary strands. The

www.aacrjournals.org

double-stranded products were end labeled with [a-32P] dCTP (GE
Healthcare Bio-Science) using the Klenow fragment (Fermentas, Vilnius,
Lithuania) and purified from gels. Then, GST-fusion proteins and 4 Ag
of nuclear extracts from PC3 cells were incubated for 5 min at room
temperature in a final volume of 20 AL containing 12 mmol/L HEPES,
50 mmol/L KCl, 40 mmol/L NaCl, 1.1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.05%
NP40, 0.5 Ag poly-(dI-dC), and 4 ng of 32P-oligonucleotide probe. For
competition assays, the indicated amounts of cold NFnB oligo were added.
The reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis and gels were dried
and analyzed using a bio-imaging analyzer (FLA2000; Fujifilm).
Preparation of human tissue samples. For human prostate cancer
samples, 37 cases of surgically resected tumors or needle biopsy specimens were examined in the Department of Pathology II at University of
Occupational and Environmental Health in Kitakyushu, Japan (Supplementary Table). The diagnosis was evaluated and confirmed by at least three
board-certified surgical pathologists who had examined formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections attained with H&E or appropriate
immunohistochemical stains.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed by using the antibody-linked dextran polymer method (Envision;
DAKO). Deparaffinized and rehydrated 5-Am sections were antigen
retrieved by heating them in Target retrieval solution (DAKO) for 20 min,
and then incubating them in 3% H2O2 for 10 min to block endogeneous
peroxidase activity. The sections were thereafter rinsed and incubated with
an antibody against PDCD4 or YB-1. The second antibody/peroxidaselinked polymers were then applied, and the sections were incubated with a
solution consisting of 20 mg of 3.3¶-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride,
65 mg of sodium azide, and 20 mL of 30% H2O2 in 100 mL of Tri-HCl
(50 mmol/L; pH 7.6). After having been counterstained with Meyer’s
hematoxylin, the sections were observed under a light microscope. For
nuclear PDCD4 immunohistochemistry of prostate cancer tissues, no
positive nuclear areas of the neoplasms were considered as negative
staining. Positive nuclear areas of neoplasms were defined as positive
staining and were graded into three categories: (+), positive area of <10%;
(++), 10% to 25%; (+++), >25% positive area. For YB-1 immunohistochemistry
of prostate cancer tissues, positive areas comprising <10% of the neoplasms
were considered as negative staining. Positive areas that were z10% were
defined as positive staining and were graded into three categories: (+),
positive area of 10% to 25%; (++), 25% to 50%; (+++), >50% positive area.
Cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation assays were carried out as
described previously (4, 9). Briefly, 1.5  104 PC3 cells and its stable
transfectants were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with the
indicated amounts of expression plasmids or siRNA using Superfect reagent
(Qiagen) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively. Cells were
harvested with trypsin and counted daily using a Coulter-type cell size
analyzer (CDA-500; Sysmex).
Colony formation assay. Colony formation assays were carried out as
described previously (4). Briefly, 3  102 PC3 cells, its stable transfectants
and PC3 cells with the transfection of the indicated siRNA were seeded in
35-mm dishes. The following day, the indicated amounts of cisplatin,
paclitaxel, etoposide, or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were applied. After 7 d, the
number of colonies was counted after 2% Giemsa staining.
Statistical analysis. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to
examine pairwise correlations of between PDCD4 and YB-1 expression
levels. Two-sided P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Analyses were conducted using the Stata Statistical Software Release 10.0
(Stata Corporation).

Results
PDCD4 interacts with Twist1. To identify functional partners
of Twist1, we screened an array of hundreds of GST-fusion proteins
using membrane pulldown assays. Among the GST-fusion proteins, Twist1 interacted with PDCD4 and p53 (9). To confirm the
results of the membrane pulldown assays, coimmunoprecipitation

experiments were carried out using lysates of PC3 cells cotransfected with HA-PDCD4 and Flag-Twist1 (Fig. 1A). We found that
HA-PDCD4 physically interacts with Twist1 protein. We also confirmed that endogeneous PDCD4 interacts with Twist1 (Fig. 1B).
We next used GST-Twist1–truncated proteins to map the PDCD4
binding sites (Fig. 1C). The association of PDCD4 with Twist1 was
abolished when mutants with serial deletions of the COOH terminus
of GST-Twist1 N121 were tested in GST pulldown assays (Fig. 1C).

Our results suggest that the COOH terminus of Twist1 containing the
basic helix-loop-helix domain mediates the direct interaction with
PDCD4 proteins. PDCD4 has been shown to interact with eIF4A (11).
Therefore, we analyzed the primary structure of eIF4A and found
that the amino-terminal region of eIF4A possesses sequence
homology with the basic helix-loop-helix region of Twist1, which is
evolutionarily conserved. In this region, the isoelectric point (pI)
value is basic and similar between the two proteins (Fig. 1D).

each of the indicated expression plasmids were immunoprecipitated (IP ) with anti-Flag (M2) antibody. The resulting immunocomplexes and whole-cell extracts (30 Ag)
were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting analysis was performed using anti-HA and anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. IB, immunoblotting. B, nuclear extracts

PDCD4 Down-regulates YB-1 Expression

PDCD4 inhibits the transcriptional function of Twist1. We
found that PDCD4 physically interacts with the basic helix-loophelix DNA binding domain of Twist1, indicating that PDCD4 may
modulate the DNA binding activity of Twist1. EMSA assays using
nuclear extracts from PC3 cells showed that the DNA binding of
Twist1 was decreased in the presence of GST-PDCD4 (Fig. 2A
and B). Because the DNA-protein complex (C) was significantly

reduced when nuclear extracts from cells transfected with Twist1specific siRNA were used, we confirmed that the DNA-protein
complex (C) mainly contains Twist1.
Next, luciferase assays were carried out to assess the effect of
PDCD4 on Twist1 transcriptional activity. Recently, we reported
that Twist1 transactivated the YB-1 gene promoter via an E-box (4).
Cotransfection of HA-PDCD4 inhibited the activation of YB-1

Figure 2. PDCD4 regulates YB-1 expression by inhibiting the DNA binding ability of Twist1. A, purified GST and GST-PDCD4 fusion proteins used for EMSAs
were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. B, nuclear extracts (4 Ag) from PC3 cells transfected with the indicated siRNA, indicated GST fusion proteins (+, 50 ng; 2+,
100 ng; 4+, 200 ng), and/or nonradiolabeled oligonucleotides (+, 50 molar excess; 3+, 150 molar excess) were mixed with 4 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides
containing a Twist1 binding site. Reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5  Tris-borate EDTA buffer. Gels were dried
and analyzed using a bio-imaging analyzer (FLA2000). F and C, free probe and DNA-protein complex, respectively. C, PC3 cells were transiently cotransfected

promoter by Twist1 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, overexpression of HAPDCD4 reduced the cellular expression of YB-1 (Fig. 2D). We have
previously shown that p53 interacts with Twist and down-regulates
the YB-1 promoter activity (9). Then, we examined the effect of p53
expression on YB-1 promoter activity and YB-1 protein expression
in the presence of PDCD4 expression plasmid. The transfection of
p53 expression plasmid further down-regulated the YB-1 promoter
activity and YB-1 protein expression, suggesting that the effects of
PDCD4 and p53 on the YB-1 promoter activity were completely
independent of each other (Fig. 2C and D).
PDCD4 expression correlates inversely with YB-1 protein in
human prostate cancer. To confirm the down-regulation of YB-1
expression by PDCD4, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of 37 prostate cancer tissues. Nuclear expression of PDCD4
was evaluated because PDCD4 can interact with Twist1 in nuclei.
Representative results are shown in Fig. 3. Based on the statistical
analysis of 37 cases, a significant inverse correlation between the
expression of nuclear PDCD4 and YB-1 was found in clinical
prostate cancer tissues (coefficient of correlation, 4133; P =
0.011) as shown in Supplementary Table. These data also suggest
that PDCD4 is a negative regulator of YB-1 expression in vivo.
PDCD4 inhibits cancer cell growth and sensitizes cells to
cisplatin and paclitaxel. YB-1 is an important regulator of cell
growth and drug resistance (1, 2). Overexpression of Twist1 slightly
stimulated cell growth (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, overexpression
of PDCD4 in PC3 cells induced a significant reduction in cell
growth. Growth inhibition by overexpression of PDCD4 is almost
completely rescued by the cotransfection of cells with Twist1
expression plasmid (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, cotransfection of cells
with YB-1 completely prevented the growth retardation induced
by the transfection with PDCD4 expression plasmid (Fig. 4B). On
the other hand, knockdown of PDCD4 expression by siRNA upregulated the YB-1 expression and cell growth (Fig. 4C). We also
established two PDCD4-overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 5). These cells
showed reduced cell growth and down-regulation of YB-1 expression (Fig. 5B and C). These PDCD4-overexpressing cell lines also
showed that cell growth rate was completely recovered by the transfection of both Twist1 and YB-1 expression plasmids (Fig. 5B and C).
YB-1 expression is involved in cellular sensitivity to anticancer
agents (2). Twist1 expression is involved in paclitaxel resistance
(23–25). Therefore, we investigated whether YB-1–overexpressing
cells and PDCD4-overexpressing cells are resistant to anticancer
agents (Fig. 6A). Expectedly, YB-1–overexpressing cells are resistant
against cisplatin and paclitaxel (Fig. 6A). PDCD4-overexpressing
cells are significantly sensitive to cisplatin and paclitaxel but not
to etoposide or 5-FU (Fig. 6A). We also confirmed these results
using specific siRNA for either Twist1 or PDCD4. Down-regulation
of Twist1 expression sensitized cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel,
and down-regulation of PDCD4 rendered cells resistant against
cisplatin and paclitaxel (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
In this study, we identified Twist1 as a PDCD4-interacting
protein and provided novel evidence that PDCD4 inhibits Twist1dependent transcription of YB-1. In this regard, it is noteworthy
that the tumor suppressor PDCD4 inhibited not only translation
but also transcription. The expression of PDCD4 is modulated in
response to apoptosis signaling (10).
PDCD4 regulates the expression of genes such as p21 (14),
urokinase receptor (26), hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (17),

ornithine decarboxylase (27, 28), carbonic anhydrase II (29), and
c-Jun-NH2-kinase/c-Jun/activator protein (AP-1; ref. 30). No evidence that PDCD4 regulates specific gene expression via direct
interaction with transcription factors has been reported. PDCD4
interacts with the translation initiation factors eIF4A and eIF4G
and inhibits translation (11). PDCD4 is an acidic protein and may
recognize and interacts with specific domain containing basic
amino acids (Fig. 1E). Our data suggest that PDCD4 can bind to
the basic helix-loop-helix regions of Twist1.
PDCD4 suppresses tumor invasion by down-regulation of
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1 transcription (17). Down-regulation of PDCD4 promotes invasion through
the activation of both h-catenin/Tcf– and AP-1–dependent
transcription (31). On the other hand, Twist1 up-regulates Akt2,
leading to the promotion of invasion (24). Hypoxia-inducible
factor 1a has been shown to activate Twist1 expression directly
and promotes metastasis (32). Our data show that PDCD4 directly
interacts with Twist1, indicating that PDCD4 might contribute

to tumor invasion and metastasis through a direct interaction
with Twist1.
Twist1 is a potential oncogene interfering with the p53dependent pathway (33). We have recently found that Twist1
physically interacts with p53 (9). p53 interacts with the NH2
terminus of Twist1 and p53-dependent gene expression is
repressed by Twist1. The transfection of the p53 expression
plasmid further down-regulated the YB-1 promoter activity and
YB-1 protein expression in the presence of the PDCD4 expression plasmid (Fig. 2C). This might be due to differences in the
interaction domain of Twist1 with PDCD4. PDCD4 has been
shown to induce p21 gene expression. However, it is unknown
whether p53 is involved in PDCD4-dependent p21 expression
because Bon-1 human carcinoid cells may possess mutant p53 (14).

On the other hand, Bitomsky and colleagues (15) reported that in
HeLa cells, down-regulation of PDCD4 lead to increased expression
of p21Waf/Cip1 in a manner of p53-dependent transcription. PDCD4
exerts opposite effects on p21Waf/Cip1 expression in Bon-1 and HeLa
cells, which might be due to difference in p53 status. PC3 cells
are p53-null human prostate cancer cells, indicating that PDCD4dependent growth suppression might only be related to the Twist1/
YB-1 pathway in our study. Furthermore, PDCD4-induced growth
retardation seems to be dose dependent because PC3 cells already
expressed significant amounts of Twist1 and YB-1 protein. As
shown in Fig. 4A and B, overexpression of YB-1 could completely
rescue PDCD4-induced growth retardation, whereas overexpression of Twist1 could not because PDCD4 interacts with Twist1
but not with YB-1. Consistent with the reporter assays (Fig. 2), an

Figure 5. Twist1 and YB-1 increased cell growth. Left, 1.5  104 PC3-Mock (A), PC3-PDCD4 #13 (B), or PC3-PDCD4 #21 (C ) cells were transiently transfected
with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids. After the indicated number of hours, cell numbers were counted. All values are representations of at least

inverse correlation between the expression of nuclear PDCD4 and
YB-1 was found in clinical prostate cancer tissues (Fig. 3). It is also
possible that the cellular level of Twist 1 expression could influence
the inverse correlation between the expression of nuclear PDCD4
and YB-1. These data also suggest that PDCD4 is a negative
regulator of YB-1 gene expression in vivo.
We have shown the direct involvement of YB-1 in the cellular
response to genotoxic stress and the resistance against cisplatin
but not against etoposide or 5-FU (19). Nuclear localization of YB-1
seems to involve transcription (34) and DNA repair pathways (20).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

Although PDCD4-overexpressing cells showed reduced growth
rates, these cells were sensitive to cisplatin but not to etoposide or
5-FU. These data suggest that these effects of PDCD4 expression on
drug sensitivity are due to the down-regulation of YB-1 expression.
Twist1 is reported to be involved in the resistance against
paclitaxel (23–25). As shown in Fig. 6, YB-1 was also involved in
the resistance against paclitaxel similar to Twist1. We previously
reported that increased YB-1 expression correlated with increased
expression of P-glycoprotein during the treatment with paclitaxel
(35). Although the reason why both Twist1 and YB-1 are involved in

PDCD4 Down-regulates YB-1 Expression

the resistance against paclitaxel is not clearly understood, Twist1
might up-regulate the expressions of transporters such as Pglycoprotein through the induction of YB-1. Inverse correlation
between nuclear PDCD4 and YB-1 expressions were found in
clinical prostate cancer tissues (Fig. 3). These results indicate that

expression level of nuclear YB-1 as well as nuclear PDCD4 may
represent malignant potential of tumors and sensitivities for
anticancer agents.
Our study identified a novel connection between PDCD4 and
Twist1. The relationship with Twist1 suggests that PDCD4 is also

Figure 6. Expression level of PDCD4 was involved in sensitivities of PC3 cells toward cisplatin or paclitaxel but not to etoposide or 5-FU. A, YB-1–stable transfectants
(PC3-YB-1 #2, PC3-YB-1 #35 ), PDCD4-stable transfectants (PC3-PDCD4 #13, PC3-PDCD4 #21 ), and control cells (PC3-Mock ) were seeded in 35-mm dishes (left ).
The following day, cells were exposed to various concentrations of cisplatin, paclitaxel, etoposide, or 5-FU. Seven days posttransfection, the number of colonies
was counted following 2% Giemsa staining. Colony counts in the absence of drugs corresponded to 100%. All values are the representatives of at least three
independent experiments. Points, mean; bars, SD. Right, whole-cell extracts from the indicated stable transfectants of PC3 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE,
and Western blotting analysis was performed using the indicated antibodies. Relative intensities are shown at the bottom of each panel. B, PC3 cells transfected

of cancer.
