Induction of Therapeutic Senescence in
Vemurafenib-Resistant Melanoma by Extended
Inhibition of CDK4/6
Akihiro Yoshida1, Eric K. Lee2, and J. Alan Diehl1

Abstract
Dysregulation of the p16–cyclin D1–CDK4/6–Rb pathway
occurs frequently in melanoma; however, the therapeutic efﬁcacy
of CDK4/6 inhibition remains to be critically evaluated. We demonstrate that CDK4/6 inhibition inhibits melanoma progression
through induction of senescence. Palbociclib, a speciﬁc CDK4/6
inhibitor, rapidly induces cell cycle arrest within 24 hours and
continued exposure for 8 days or longer induces senescence. The
induction of senescence correlates with inhibition of mTOR and
more speciﬁcally mTORC1 signaling. Vemurafenib, a speciﬁc

BRAFV600E inhibitor, has signiﬁcant clinical efﬁcacy in BRAFV600Epositive melanomas, but its impact is hampered by a rapid acquisition of resistance. Strikingly, we found that vemurafenib-resistant
tumors remain sensitive to palbociclib, suggesting that initial treatment with vemurafenib followed by palbociclib with or without
mTOR inhibitors might provide an avenue to overcome recurrence
of vemurafenib-resistant metastatic disease. Taken together, these
results support palbociclib as a promising therapeutic for treatment
of melanoma. Cancer Res; 76(10); 2990–3002. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

line therapies that have signiﬁcant clinical impact on the resistant
tumors.
Senescence, initially identiﬁed by Hayﬂick and Moorhead, is
induced by a number of biologic stresses such as DNA damage
accumulation, acute oncogene activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and expression of INK4A/ARF locus in over passaged primary cells in a p53-dependent or independent manner
(16). Critically, senescence is deﬁned as a permanent cell-cycle
arrest and considered as one of the defense mechanisms against
cancers (17).
PD0332991, commonly referred to as palbociclib, is an FDAapproved orally available, highly selective ATP-competitive
inhibitor of CDK4 (IC50: 0.011 mmol/L) and CDK6 (IC50:
0.016 mmol/L; ref. 18) with clinical evidence of growth inhibitory activity. Palbociclib is being tested in more than 17
clinical trials for malignancies such as mantle cell lymphoma,
breast cancer, and colorectal cancer (18–21). However, the
utility of the drug has not yet been evaluated in melanoma,
a cancer that when metastatic remains largely intractable. We
have investigated the efﬁcacy of CDK4/6 inhibition in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma and have begun to dissect the
molecular mechanism of acquired resistance to palbociclib.

The most frequent mutation that occurs in melanoma occurs in
Braf at amino acid 600 (BrafV600E). However BrafV600E alone elicits
senescence (1, 2). Multiple studies provide evidence that Ras-Raf–
driven tumorigenesis is markedly enhanced in the context of
dysregulated cyclin D1/CDK4 activity (3–7). Indeed, inactivation
of p16INK4a, an allosteric inhibitor of CDK4/6, occurs in up to
70% of human melanomas (8). Additional genetic support for the
importance of dysregulation of cyclin D1/CDK4 in melanoma
stems from the demonstration that inactivation of p16INK4a or
deletion of Fbxo4, the speciﬁcity component of the E3 ligase that
directs cyclin D1 degradation, cooperates with BrafV600E to induce
metastatic melanoma (9–13).
Vemurafenib, an ATP-competitive small-molecule BrafV600E
inhibitor, has been approved by the FDA, and has marked
antitumor effects with BrafV600E melanoma, but not Braf WT
melanoma (14). Initial treatment with vemurafenib results in
tumor shrinkage lasting 3 to 6 months in clinical trials; unfortunately, however, tumors relapse due to the acquired resistance to
vemurafenib, and overall survival is only extended several months
(15). Current efforts are focused on the development of second-

containing 0.5% FBS for 48 hours at high density on the plates
(contact inhibition) for G0–G1 phase; treated with 1 mmol/L
hydroxyurea for G1–S phase, and 40 ng/mL nocodazole for
G2–M phase, respectively. For the cytotoxicity experiment for
vemurafenib (PLX4032), melanoma cells were incubated with
vemurafenib at 10 mmol/L for 2 days. For viral production, viral
expression plasmids were transfected into 293T cells with lipofectamine together with packaging plasmid. Virus supernatants
harvested 48 to 72 hours after transfection were used to infect
melanoma cells with polybrene (10 mg/mL).
Flow cytometric analysis
Cells were trypsinized and stained with 10 mg/mL propidium
iodide (PI) containing 100 mg/mL RNaseA and 0.5% FBS followed
by ﬁxation with 70% ethanol. For the bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) incorporation, cells were incubated in medium containing 10 mmol/L BrdUrd for 45minutes before harvest and then
ﬁxed with 70% ethanol, treated with 1.5 N HCl, stained with antiBrdUrd mouse mAb, and subsequently FITC-linked mouse IgG
staining. Cytotoxicity for palbociclib was assayed by Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell-cycle distribution, BrdUrd-positive
cells, and Annexin V–positive cells were quantiﬁed using a BD
LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences).
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.0,
120 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% NP40) containing
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 20 U/mL aprotinin,
1 mmol/L leupeptin, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmol/L NaF,
0.1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane, and immunoblotted with
appropriate antibodies. pRb (S780), p19Ink4d (M-167), p62 (D3), and MDM2 (C-18) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), ERK1/2, p-mTOR (Ser2448),
mTOR, p-Akt (S478), pan-Akt (11E7), p-GSK3b (Ser9), p-S6K
(Thr389), S6K (49D7), and p-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) from Cell
Signaling Technology. Raptor and Rictor were purchased from
Bethyl laboratories. Cyclin D1 (Ab-3) was purchased from Millipore. LC3B and b-actin (AC-15) were purchased from Sigma. Rb
(G3-245) was obtained from BD Pharmingen. Signals were visualized using ECL (PerkinElmer).
qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen),
and reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was
performed using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad) and the data were normalized by GAPDH.
IHC and immunohistoﬂuorescence
Tissues were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, deparafﬁnized,
and rehydrated in gradient ethanol. Sections were blocked with
10% goat serum and incubated with the primary antibodies
against the following: p-S6 (S235/236), p-Akt (S473), Ki-67, and
pRb (S780). For IHC, sections were incubated with biotinylated
rabbit antibodies and developed with ABC substrate kit (Vector
Laboratories) followed by DAB reaction (Vector Laboratories),
and counterstained with hematoxylin (Thermo Scientiﬁc). For

immunoﬂuorescence, sections were incubated with Alex Fluor
488 or Alexa Fluor 546–conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit antibodies (Life Technologies), and mounted with ProLong Gold
antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen).
Senescence assays
Cells, 2.5103/60-mm plate, were treated with 1 mmol/L
palbociclib with fresh palbociclib added daily for 8 days. Cells
were cultured for an additional 14 days following removal of
drug, in complete growth media and colonies were visualized by
Giemsa stain. For senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity
(SA-bGal), cultured melanoma cells or frozen tissue samples in
Tissue-Tek OCT compounds (Sakura Finetek) were ﬁxed and
incubated with X-gal staining solution (Sigma) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. For ELISA, melanoma cells were
cultured with or without palbociclib. SASP expression such as
IL6 (D6050), IL8 (D8000C), CXCL1/GROa (DGR00) in supernatants were analyzed with ELISA Kits (R&D Systems) according
to the manufacturer's protocol.
Xenografts
A total of 2106 melanoma cells were subcutaneously injected
into 6-week-old SCID mice with Matrigel. Mice were treated with
DMSO (control) or 90 mg/kg of palbociclib every day when
tumors developed 2 mm after injection. Tumor volumes were
measured by caliper every 2 or 3 days and calculated by the
following formula V ¼ (Length  width  height)/2. Mice were
sacriﬁced and the tumor size was measured when tumors reached
10 mm. Care of experimental animals was done in accordance
with the institutional guidelines.

Results
CDK4/6 inhibition induces senescence in melanoma-derived
cells
The dysregulation of p16–CDK4–cyclin D1–Rb pathway in a
majority of melanomas suggests that small-molecule inhibition
of the cyclin D1/CDK4 kinase might be an effective therapeutic
strategy for limiting melanoma progression. To test this, we
treated 1205Lu melanoma cells with palbociclib, a speciﬁc
CDK4/6 inhibitor (18). Palbociclib treatment triggered G0–G1
arrest that was associated with dephosphorylation of Rb at serine780 (S780), with no increase in p19INK4d or p21 noted (Fig. 1A
and B). Palbociclib-dependent reduction in Rb levels has been
observed previously and while it has been associated with reduced
stability, the mechanism remains unclear (23). qPCR analysis
revealed an approximate 30% to 40% reduction in Rb expression
(Fig. 1C). Rb expression could be maintained by proteasome
inhibitor treatment revealing coordinate regulation of both
expression and protein stability (Fig. 1D). Although CDK4/6
inhibition is widely known to trigger reversible quiescence, prolonged inhibition of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 has also been associated
with senescence or permanent growth arrest (19, 24, 25). To
address the acquisition of senescence, 1205Lu cells were exposed
to palbociclib for varying intervals and senescence was addressed
through several distinct criteria: (i) SA-b-gal; (ii) senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP) such as IL6, IL8, and
CXCL1; (iii) senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF)
formation; and (iv) ATR-X foci formation (23). An increase in all
senescence-associated marks was noted at day 4 with maximal
induction noted by day 8 by all criteria (Fig. 1E–H).

Because senescence is deﬁned as permanent or irreversible cellcycle arrest, whereas quiescence is a reversible cell-cycle exit, we
examined reversibility of palbociclib-induced senescence using a
clonogenic cell survival assay. Consistent with senescence, 8 days
of palbociclib reduced colony formation by 80% (Fig. 1I). We
exposed several additional melanoma cell lines to extended
palbociclib treatment and observed markers of senescence including SA-bGal positivity (Fig 1J).
To independently evaluate the impact of CDK4/6 inhibition,
we utilized an INK4 family protein, p19INK4d that binds and
speciﬁcally inhibits CDK4/6 in Rb-positive cells (26, 27). We
utilized two distinct melanoma cell lines. 1205Lu, which in
addition to harboring a BRAFV600E mutation, also has a CDK4R24C mutation; the R24C mutation falls within the INK4-binding
interface making this CDK4 allele resistant to INK4-mediated
inhibition (28, 29). We also used 983B cells that express wild-type
CDK4 and CDK6, as well as BRAFV600E. Expression of p19INK4d
induced G0 arrest and Rb dephosphorylation in 983B within

www.aacrjournals.org

the ﬁrst 36 hours (Fig 2A and B), while 1205Lu cells were
refractory. Consistent with persistent CDK4/6 inhibition inducing a switch from quiescence (G0) to senescence, we noted a
striking increase in SA-b-gal positivity 8 days after infection of
983B cells (Fig 2C). To assess whether senescence depends on
p53–p21 signaling, we expressed the HPV E6 to inactivate p53
(Fig. 2D). Palbociclib treatment triggered G0–G1 arrest at 1 day
and senescence by 8 days in cells expressing E6 (Fig. 2E and F).
This is consistent with the observation that p21 is not induced
by palbociclib exposure (Fig. 1B).
Palbociclib-induced senescence abrogates vemurafenibdependent cytotoxicity
To assess the effect of combining vemurafenib with palbociclib, 1205Lu cells were treated with vemurafenib, palbociclib, or
both. Vemurafenib treatment resulted in 80% of cells undergoing
apoptosis, whereas palbociclib treatment promoted only cellcycle arrest (Fig 3A). Strikingly, palbociclib substantially inhibited

CDK4/6 Inhibition Triggers Tumor Cell Senescence

vemurafenib-dependent cytotoxicity, resulting in a shift from cell
death to G0 arrest (Fig. 3A and B). With increasing time of
exposure to palbociclib, cells exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced
sensitivity to vemurafenib-dependent killing (Fig. 3B), suggesting
acquisition of senescence-conferred resistance. To further test this
hypothesis, 1205Lu cells were arrested by serum starvation/contact inhibition [G0/quiescence, (Fig. 3E), hydroxyurea (G1–S)
or nocodazole (G2–M] and then exposed to vemurafenib for
48 hours. Vemurafenib efﬁciently triggered apoptosis under all
conditions (Fig. 3D) demonstrating that cell-cycle arrest per se did
not prevent vemurafenib-dependent cytotoxicity. Immunoblot
analysis revealed that palbociclib rapidly reduced Rb phosphorylation; strikingly, vemurafenib treatment was associated with
reduced Erk activation only in cells exposed to palbociclib for
2 days (Fig 3C). Palbociclib treatment for 3 or more days
reduced sensitivity to vemurafenib (Fig. 3C).
To evaluate Rb function in palbociclib-induced senescence,
E7 was introduced into 1205Lu cells. E7 expression inhibited
palbociclib-induced senescence (Fig. 3F–H). E7 also resensitized
cells to vemurafenib-dependent cytotoxicity (Fig. 3F). As E7
interacts with p107 and p130, we utilized two distinct shRNAs
to knockdown Rb. Rb knockdown cells were refractory to palbociclib-induced senescence (Fig. 3I–K), and were resensitized to
vemurafenib-induced cell death (Fig. 3F), consistent with CDK4/
6–dependent senescence being both Rb-dependent and antagonizing vemurafenib-dependent cell death (30).
Palbociclib induces senescence in vemurafenib-resistant
melanoma
983BR is a vemurafenib-resistant cell line derived from 983B
cultured under conditions of increasing concentrations of vemurafenib to acquire the resistance (Supplementary Fig. S1). Palbociclib induced G0 arrest in both parental 983B (Fig. 1J) and 983BR
cells (Fig. 4A), with markedly reduced BrdUrd incorporation (Fig.
4B). Arrest was associated with dephosphorylation of Rb, with no
increase in CDK inhibitors such as p19INK4d and p21 (Figs. 1B
and 4C). Eight days of palbociclib or p19INK4d introduction
resulted in greater than 80% of cells staining positively for SAbGal (Fig 4D and E). Palbociclib treatment for 8 days also
inhibited long-term colony formation (Fig. 4F). Analysis of the
kinetics of senescence induction revealed that 983BR exhibited a
trend toward increased palbociclib-induced senescence (Fig. 4G
and H). No difference was noted in the sensitivity of 983B versus
983BR to cell-cycle arrest (Fig. 4I and J).
Palbociclib induces senescence in vivo
To address the ability of palbociclib to inhibit melanoma
progression in vivo, 983B or 983BR cells were injected into SCID
mice. Palbociclib efﬁciently inhibited growth of 983B and
983BR cells (Fig. 5A–C). Palbociclib reduced Ki-67, Rb phos-

phorylation (Fig. 5D), and residual exhibited strong SA-b-gal
positivity (Fig. 5E). Analysis of palbociclib action in vitro
suggested that 8 days of exposure was sufﬁcient to induce
senescence. To determine whether 8 days were sufﬁcient for
senescence in vivo, we conducted a second trial wherein tumorburdened mice were administered palbociclib daily for 3 or 8
days. Tumors in the 3-day treatment group developed as fast as
controls, whereas mice treated for 8 days exhibited stable
disease (Fig. 5F). At later time points, some tumors escaped
and reinitiated growth. Cell lines derived from these tumors
were found to be resistant to palbociclib, suggesting acquired
resistance (see Fig. 6).
Inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway is critical for
palbociclib-induced senescence in melanoma
Recent work provided evidence that activation of mTOR signaling can bypass senescence in mouse models of melanoma
(31). Highlighting a role for mTOR, decreased mTOR phosphorylation occurred by 8 days of palbociclib administration (Fig. 6A).
Decreased phosphorylation of Akt, GSK3b, S6K, and 4EBP1,
downstream of targets of mTOR, was observed demonstrating
mTOR inhibition (Fig 6A). In contrast, rapamycin reduced
mTORC1 signaling within the ﬁrst 24 hours. Palbociclib with
rapamycin accelerated downregulation of mTOR signaling pathway. On the basis of these data, we considered whether inhibition
of mTOR signaling was critical for the transition of senescence.
We ﬁrst assessed whether palbociclib treatment also correlated
with mTOR inhibition in vivo. Consistently, IHC of palbociclibtreated tumors revealed reduced p-S6K and p-Akt (S473; Fig. 6B).
The downregulation of mTOR signaling is associated with
reduced protein stability of mTOR, Raptor, and Rictor (Fig. 6C)
following palbociclib treatment as MG132, 26S rescued expression levels while their mRNA levels were unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
We subsequently evaluated cell-cycle progression following
single versus simultaneous exposure for 8 days. Both rapamycin
and palbociclib induced G0 arrest with palbociclib exhibiting
better potency (Fig. 6D). Combining rapamycin with palbociclib induced G0 arrest in greater than 95% of cells, with no
discernable apoptosis; Rb knockdown inhibited palbociclibinduced senescence and resensitized the cells to vemurafenibdependent cytotoxicity demonstrating Rb dependence (Figs. 3F
and 6D). Importantly, clonogenic assays revealed that the
combination of palbociclib plus rapamycin synergistically
inhibited colony formation relative to either compound alone
(Fig. 6E), with 3 days of the combination being as effective as
palbociclib only treatment for 8 days in vemurafenib-resistant
melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B), indicating that
mTOR signaling inhibition cooperates with palbociclib to
induce senescence on melanoma.

Palbociclib

mTOR signaling pathway was completely recovered and refractory to palbociclib treatment in the palbociclib-resistant cells
(PR1, 2, 3, 6, and 7) compared with untreated cells or palbociclib-sensitive cells treated with palbociclib for 8 days (Fig. 6F). We
note speciﬁcally that Raptor and Rictor protein levels are lost in
na€ve cells, but recovered in resistant clones; however, their mRNA
levels remain stable in the palbociclib-resistant cells (PR1, 2, 3, 6,
and 7; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Collectively, our data suggest that
inhibition of mTOR signaling following long-term CDK4/6 inhibition contributes to senescence and that acquisition of palbociclib resistance results in re-activation of mTORC1 signaling via
induction of Raptor.
Overexpression of mTOR signaling overrides palbociclibinduced senescence in melanoma
mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that serves as the common catalytic component of two distinct complexes commonly
referred to as mTORC1 and mTORC2 (32–34). Although these
complexes share a number of components, they are distinguished by certain unique components including, Raptor for
mTORC1 complex and Rictor for mTORC2 complex. Although

www.aacrjournals.org

mTORC1 complex is a master regulator of cell proliferation and
metabolism through phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1,
mTORC2 has a more direct impact on cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism through the regulation of AKT (34).
Because palbociclib treatment induces Raptor and Rictor loss
(and resistant cell reacquire their expression), we chose to
interrogate the contribution of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways in context of palbociclib-induced senescence
in melanoma. Raptor or Rictor were knocked down in 1205Lu
melanoma cells with validated shRNAs (Fig. 7B; ref. 35). Raptor
knockdown was associated with cell-cycle arrest, whereas
Rictor knockdown had little impact (Fig. 7A; top). Concurrent
palbociclib treatment with Raptor knockdown for 24 hours
induced complete G0 arrest. Extended palbociclib treatment
of Raptor knockdown cells for 8 days eliminated colony outgrowth compared with palbociclib alone where approximately
20% of cells exhibited resistance to senescence and the combination of palbociclib and shRictor was similar to palbociclib
alone (Fig. 7A, bottom). Similar results were obtained in
983BR (vemurafenib resistant) cells as well as 1205Lu cells,
suggesting that mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, especially

mTORC1 complex, are critical for cell viability and proliferation in melanoma cells, and contribute to palbociclib-induced
senescence.
We next determined whether we could bypass palbociclibdependent senescence by driving mTORC1 with Raptor overexpression or as a control myristoylated Akt (Myr-Akt; Fig. 7D).
Palbociclib treatment for 1 day induced G0 arrest in control cells.
Cells overexpressing Raptor were refractory to palbociclib, whereas Myr-Akt overexpression had no impact (Fig. 7C). In addition,
clonogenic assays revealed that Raptor expression inhibited palbociclib-induced senescence; in contrast, overexpression of Akt or
S6K had little impact on senescence (Fig. 7E). Similar results were
obtained in 983BR vemurafenib-resistant cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). These results indicate that inhibition of mTORC1 is
essential for palbociclib-induced senescence.

Discussion
Multiple genetic alterations are reported to directly contribute
to the genesis of metastatic melanomas. Among these, BRAF is the
most frequently mutated gene in melanoma where the BRAFV600E
mutation is observed in approximately 66% of melanoma (36).
Vemurafenib is a speciﬁc BRAFV600E inhibitor (14); it has significant initial clinical impact on BRAFV600E-positive tumors, but has
limited long-term potential due to the rapid acquisition of resistance. Thus, the development of secondary treatment strategies for
the treatment of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma is of unquestionable importance. On the basis of the results described here, we
propose the use of vemurafenib to reduce tumor volume/bulk
followed by treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor to induce senescence in the residual tumor cells that are resistant to vemurafenib.
The CDK4–Rb pathway is disrupted in a majority of melanomas and mechanisms include cyclin D1 ampliﬁcation (37),
activating mutations in CDK4 (29), inactivation of Fbxo4, an
E3 ligase that regulates degradation of cyclin D1, and thereby
functions as a tumor suppressor (13), and deletion of gene
encoding p16Ink4a (8). On the basis of these and additional
observations, the cyclin D1–CDK4/6–Rb axis is considered a
major driver of melanomagenesis. Importantly, the observation
that Rb, a direct substrate for the cyclin D1/CDK4/6 kinase, is
generally wild-type in melanoma (>95%) suggests that continued
CDK4/6 function will be required for ongoing melanoma cell
proliferation and as such inhibition of CDK4/6 should result in
Rb-dependent cell-cycle arrest. Surprisingly, the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the CDK4/6 inhibition in melanoma remains to be
examined. Our work demonstrates that melanoma-derived cells
are indeed responsive to CDK4/6 inhibition. Treatment of cells
with either palbociclib or enforced expression of an Ink4 family
member induces rapid Rb-dependent G0 arrest. Prolonged CDK4/
6 inhibition induced a switch from quiescence to senescence,
"geroconversion" (Fig. 1). Geroconversion was noted to be time
dependent, was maximal at 8 days, and exhibited key characteristics of senescence, of which "permanent growth arrest" is the
most clinically relevant. In a preclinical model, we noted that
palbociclib treatment for 8 days was as effective as continuous
exposure with regard to tumor progression. Although the potential translation of this concept to the clinic remains to be carefully
evaluated, xenograft tumors were characterized by reduced phospho-Rb, reduced proliferation, and stained positively for SA-b-Gal
consistent with on-target effects of palbociclib. The robust impact
of 8 days of palbociclib treatment could have important clinical

3000 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

implications. Clinically, reduced time of treatment will reduce
side toxicities associated with CDK inhibition as well as reduce
patient cost. More importantly, given the prevalence of acquired
resistance to precision medicine, perhaps reduced time of patient
exposure could also reduce acquisition of resistance.
Although palbociclib recently received FDA approval (38),
there is little data on tumor-intrinsic or acquired resistance.
However, intrinsic resistance could be predicted based upon Rb
status (39). Importantly, Rb is rarely lost in melanoma. We did
note that inactivation of Rb through knockdown or expression of
HPV-E7 in melanoma cells, (vemurafenib sensitive or resistant),
confers complete resistance to either palbociclib treatment or
Ink4a expression. With regard to intrinsic and acquired resistance,
resistance of a small number of clones that grew out during
clonogenic cell survival assays was observed. Consistently, we
also noted mice treated with palbociclib eventually succumbed to
melanoma several weeks after drug removal (data not shown).
Cultured cells from either source revealed resistance to palbociclib-induced growth arrest and senescence. Whether the resistance
of cell lines is `acquired' or represents an intrinsic property of a
certain population of cells remains to be established. We do note
that resistant cell lines are both stably resistant and 100% of cells
are resistant; thus, they do not appear to represent outgrowth from
a small fraction of stem/repopulating cells that give rise once again
to 80% sensitive and 20% resistant. With regard to the mechanism
of resistance, two events are worth noting. First, Rb loss was
observed in some resistant cell lines (PR1, 2, and 3; Supplementary Fig. S4A) generated in culture, while Raptor overexpression
and constitutive mTOR signaling were observed in all resistant cell
lines (Fig. 6F), suggesting that mTOR signaling directly contributes to resistance. In addition, Rb suppression is not stable
(Supplementary Fig. S4B), whereas resistance to palbociclib and
Raptor overexpression are both stably maintained in palbociclibresistant cells supporting a hypothesis where reduced mTOR/
mTORC1 signaling with palbociclib is necessary for senescence.
Whereas the molecular mechanism, whereby inhibition of
CDK4/6 impacts Raptor and mTORC1 signaling, remains to be
further investigated, we observed that concurrent treatment of
melanoma cells with palbociclib and rapamycin (or Raptor
knockdown) was much more effective in triggering permanent
growth arrest. Raptor was also strongly induced in palbociclibresistant clones suggesting that mTOR inhibition is critical for
senescence induction with palbociclib. Finally, concurrent palbociclib þ rapamycin increased melanoma sensitivity to palbociclib
and coordinated CDK4/6 and mTOR inhibition both increased
palbociclib-dependent senescence in 983BR cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2B), suggesting that perhaps reducing the acquisition of
cellular resistance. Interestingly, rapamycin was suggested to
suppress palbociclib-induced senescence in MEL10 cells (40).
The basis of this result is unclear as all melanoma-derived cell
lines tested herein exhibited increased sensitivity. Importantly,
there is likely to be tissue speciﬁcity that will determine the impact
of combination therapy. Indeed, we noted that rapamycin exposure opposed palbociclib-induced senescence in esophageal cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5). Collectively, these data
reveal the clinically relevant concept that concomitant treatment
of palbociclib and rapamycin has a durable effect on senescence
and inhibits acquired resistance to palbociclib in melanoma.
CDK4/6 inhibition is showing signiﬁcant therapeutic promise
in ER(þ)/ HER2() advanced breast cancer (41); we suggest it
should also have signiﬁcant clinical value in vemurafenib-

CDK4/6 Inhibition Triggers Tumor Cell Senescence

resistant metastatic melanoma. The ability to induce permanent
growth arrest would reduce time of patient exposure to drug,
which may in turn reduce side toxicities and potentially acquired
resistance. The development of a treatment strategy, however,
requires detailed molecular understanding of how CDK4/6 inhibition generates a senescent phenotype and in turn when resistance emerges, the precise underlying mechanism.
In this regard, one might ﬁrst consider known substrates for the
CDK4/6 kinase, which include Rb, p107, p130, FOXM1 (19),
PRMT5 (42), and GCN5 (43) and how any of these intersect with
mTOR signaling, given that mTORC1 suppression is necessary for
senescence. How and whether any of these molecules contribute
mTOR/mTORC1 signaling/inhibition following CDK4/6 inhibition remains to be established. Importantly, our data support a
model where CDK4/6 inhibition triggers reduced expression of
mTOR and the mTORC1-speciﬁc protein Raptor at the posttranslational level.
A second clinically important consideration in developing a
treatment strategy for the use of palbociclib emerges from the data
on the concurrent use of vemurafenib and palbociclib treatment.
Surprisingly, concurrent treatment is not synergistic; in contrast,
palbociclib inhibits the cytotoxicity of vemurafenib. Such an
impact in vivo would prevent the efﬁcacious debulking impact
of vemurafenib treatment. At a mechanistic level, this is reﬂected
in a failure of vemurafenib to inhibit ERK/MAPK activation. This
result is not a simple matter of cell-cycle arrest, as vemurafenib was
effective in cells arrested via growth factor restriction (G0), nocodazole (G2–M), and hydroxyurea (G1–S). Rather, resistance to
vemurafenib correlates directly with geroconversion. From a
clinical point of view, our data support the concept of palbociclib
as a second-line therapy that could limit melanoma patient
relapse following tumor debulking with a BRAF inhibitor such

as vemurafenib (Supplementary Fig. S6). Finally, concurrent use
of palbociclib with an mTOR inhibitor may have increased
efﬁcacy in the induction of bona ﬁde senescence and also limit
the acquisition of palbociclib resistance.
