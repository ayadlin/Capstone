ABSTRACT
Resistance to Imatinib mesylate (IM) is an emerging problem for patients
with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). T315I mutation in the Bcr-Abl is the
predominant mechanism of the acquired resistance to IM and second generation
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Therefore it is urgent to search for new measures to
overcome TKI-resistance. Auranofin (AF), clinically used to treat rheumatic arthritis,
was recently approved by US Food and Drug Administration for Phase II clinical trial
to treat cancer. In contrast to the reports that AF induces apoptosis by increasing
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels via inhibiting thioredoxin reductase,
our recent study revealed that AF-induced apoptosis depends on inhibition of
proteasomal deubiquitinases (UCHL5 and USP14). Here we report that (i) AF induces
apoptosis in both Bcr-Abl wild-type cells and Bcr-Abl-T315I mutation cells and inhibits
the growth of IM-resistant Bcr-Abl-T315I xenografts in vivo; (ii) AF inhibits BcrAbl through both downregulation of Bcr-Abl gene expression and Bcr-Abl cleavage
mediated by proteasome inhibition-induced caspase activation; (iii)  proteasome
inhibition but not ROS is required for AF-induced caspase activation and apoptosis.
These findings support that AF overcomes IM resistance through both Bcr/Abldependent and -independent mechanisms, providing great clinical significance for
cancer treatment.

is responsible for malignant transformation by activating
multiple signal transduction pathways, including the
MAPK/ERK cascade, PI3K/Akt, and STATs [2-4].
Activation of these pathways in Bcr-Abl expressing cells
results in increased expression of several antiapoptotic
proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, XIAP, thus
leading to advantaged cell survival [5-7]. Bcr-Abl
tyrosine kinase has been considered as an important
target for CML therapeutics [8, 9]. Imatinib mesylate
(IM) is the first selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor for
cancer therapy approved by the United States Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). Clinical studies show that
IM is highly effective in newly diagnosed patients with
chronic phase CML, and to a less extent, in patents with
accelerated and blastic-phase disease [10]. Unfortunately,
resistance to IM develops over time and is becoming
an emerging problem for CML treatment [11]. Among
several mechanisms proposed to explain the IM resistance,
amplification and mutation of Bcr-Abl are believed to be
the main cause. Approximately 50 point mutations in the
Bcr-Abl gene have been identified and associated with
clinical resistance to IM. The T315I missense mutation
of Bcr-Abl accounting for about 20% of all the point
mutations is the most stubborn point mutation impacting
on the binding of IM with Bcr-Abl kinase domain and
thereby causing IM resistance [12, 13]. To overcome the
acquired resistance to IM, new tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI) such as nilotinib, dasatinib and INNO-406 have
been developed and are effective against most mutations
but not the T315I mutation [14-16]. Thus, novel strategies
to overcome IM resistance are desperately needed. To this
end, ponatinib has been established as a third generation
TKI, which suggests that inhibiting Bcr-Abl expression is
a promising approach [17].
Auranofin (AF) is a metal phosphine complex that
has been used for the clinical treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis, following the pioneering studies conducted with
gold (I) thiolate compounds [18]. Previous studies have
suggested that AF acted as an inhibitor of thioredoxin
reductase, which could cause the oxidative damage and
modifications of cellular redox status, resulting in over
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis [19, 20]. AF can
exert a strong cytotoxic effect on several different types
of neoplastic cells both in vitro and in vivo [21-23]. The
cytotoxic activity of AF along with its relative safe profile
in patients warrants the application potential of AF in
cancer therapy and other diseases [24, 25]. AF is currently
in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia
such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (http://clinicaltrials
.gov/ct2/show/ NCT01419691). Most of the previous
reports believe that AF induce apoptosis by inhibiting
thioredoxin reductase activity and increasing intracellular
ROS levels; however, our recent study unravels that AFinduced apoptosis depends on AF-mediated inhibition of
proteasomal deubiquitinases (DUBs,UCHL5 and USP14)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

but not ROS generation [26]. We and others have reported
that proteasome inhibition could overcome IM-resistance
in CML cells [27, 28], but whether the inhibition of DUBs,
especially proteasome-associated DUBs, can overcome
IM-resistance has not been reported.
Here, we investigated the antineoplastic effects of
AF in both Bcr-Abl wild-type and Bcr-Abl-T315I mutant
cell lines and in mouse IM-resistant xenograft models.
The results clearly show that AF can efficiently overcome
IM-resistance through both Bcr/Abl-dependent and
-independent mechanisms that are independent of ROS.

RESULTS
AF induces cytotoxicity in both Bcr-Abl wild-type
and Bcr-Abl-T315I cells
KBM5 (Bcr-Abl wild-type) cells are sensitive to
IM while KBM5-T315I (Bcr-Abl-T315I) cells are very
resistant to IM [13, 28]. To investigate the effect of AF on
the growth of CML cells, KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells
were treated with AF in vitro for 48 hours and cell viability
was detected by the MTS assay. As shown in Figure 1A,
AF dose-dependently decreased the cell viability in KBM5
and KBM5-T315I cell cultures with IC50 values of 0.57
and 0.50 μM, respectively.
We next analyzed the dynamics of AF induction
of cell death in Bcr-Abl wild-type and T315I mutant cell
lines. KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells were exposed to AF
followed by the trypan blue exclusion test, a time- and
dose-dependent increasing proportion of cell death was
observed by recording the number of trypan blue-positive
cells (Figure 1B). Similarly, exposure of KBM5 and
KBM5-T315I cells to escalating concentrations of AF
resulted in significantly increased Annexin V/PI-positive
cells as detected by flow cytometry analysis (Figure 1C),
supporting that AF induces apoptosis in CML cells. It
was further found that AF induced cell cycle arrest at
the G0/G1 phase in both KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells
(Figure 1D).

AF induces caspase activation in CML cells
KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells were exposed to AF,
followed by measurement of specific apoptosis-associated
changes. Western blot analysis showed that AF induced
the cleavage of PARP in both dose- and time-dependent
manner in these two CML cell lines. Also, the precursor
forms of caspase-3, -8 and -9 were decreased while the
active forms of caspase-3, -8 and -9 were detected after
AF treatment, in parallel to PARP cleavage. These results
indicate that AF triggers caspase-dependent CML cell
apoptosis (Figure 2A).

is an indicator of the early stage of apoptosis. As displayed
in Figure 2B, the integrity of mitochondrial membranes
was decreased in both KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells after
AF treatment, and the release of cytochrome C and AIF to
the cytoplasm were elevated in a time-dependent manner
in both cell lines (Figure 2C).
To further investigate the mechanism by which AF
induces apoptosis, the effect of AF on the expression of
other apoptosis-related proteins was examined. As shown
in Figure 2D, AF induced a remarkable decline in the
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2,
survivin, and XIAP in both KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cell
lines, with less significant changes in the expression of
Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and Bax.

Bcr-Abl protein and inhibits the downstream signaling of
Bcr-Abl.

Bcr-Abl down-regulation by AF is associated
with diminished gene expression and ­
caspase-dependent cleavage
To investigate the mechanism of the AF-mediated
Bcr-Abl protein down-regulation in CML cells, we
determined the expression of Bcr-Abl at the transcription
level. KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of AF for 6 hours and the
steady state Bcr-Abl mRNA levels were examined using
RT-qPCR. We found that AF treatment reduced BcrAbl mRNA level to the some extent in both cell lines
(Figure 4A). The degree of Bcr-Abl mRNA reduction
is less dramatic than that of Bcr-Abl protein reduction,
suggesting that AF-induced suppression of Bcr-Abl
transcription may not account entirely for, but is likely
partially responsible for the decreased Bcr-Abl protein
levels. This proposition is further supported by comparing
the effects of AF and bortezomib on Bcr-Abl expression.
As shown in Figure 4B, both DUB inhibitor AF and
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib caused the accumulation
of ubiquitinated proteins (Ubs), caspase activation, and
Bcr-Abl down-regulation but AF seemed to be more
potent than bortezomib in downregulating Bcr-Abl and
p-Bcr-Abl proteins, consistent with the notion that AF
inhibits Bcr-Abl gene expression.

AF down-regulates Bcr-Abl protein and inhibits
its downstream signaling
We also found that AF down-regulated the levels of
total and phosphorylated Bcr-Abl proteins in KBM5 and
KBM5-T315I cell lines in both dose- and time-dependent
manners (Figure 3A and B). Furthermore, the expression
of Bcr-Abl downstream target proteins was also affected
by AF. The phosphorylation of STAT5, ERK1/2 and Akt
was all significantly decreased, with less dramatic changes
in the levels of total ERK1/2 proteins, even though total
Akt and STAT5 proteins were decreased. The decreases
in total Akt and STAT5 occurred relatively later than the
changes of their phosphorylation forms. Taken together,
our data demonstrate that AF induces down-regulation of

We and others have reported that Bcr-Abl can be
cleaved by caspase activation [28, 29]. We observed
that pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk could inhibit
AF-mediated cell death, Bcr-Abl decreases and its
downstream event proteins to a certain extent but did not
attenuate ubiquitinated protein accumulation (Figure 4C).
These results suggest that AF-induced caspase activation
is required for downregulation of Bcr-Abl and its
downstream events.

AF inhibits the growth of Bcr-Abl wild-type and
-T315I mutant xenografts in nude mice
We next evaluate the in vivo effect of AF using a
nude mouse xenograft model. KBM5 and KMB5-T315I
cells were inoculated subcutaneously in nude mice. Mice
were then treated with intraperitoneal injections of either
vehicle or AF (7 mg/kg/d) for 12 days. It was found that
AF treatment significantly inhibited the growth of both
Bcr-Abl wild-type and Bcr-Abl-T315I mutant xenografts
(Figure 6A); the weights of tumors were significantly
reduced in AF-treated group compared to the vehicletreated (Figure 6B) while body weight remained relatively
stable in each group (data not shown). Phospho protein
levels of Bcr-Abl and its downstream targets including
Akt, Erk1/2 and STAT5 as well as total Bcr-Abl, STAT5
and Akt proteins were significantly decreased in the
AF-treated tumors (Figure 6C), while the ubiquitinated
proteins and IκB-α were greatly accumulated in AF-treated
tumors compared with the control (Figures 6C and D).
Immunostaining analysis of Ki67 (a cell proliferation
marker) revealed that AF decreased the proliferation of
xenografted KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells (Figure 6D).
Together, the results demonstrate that AF can inhibit the
in vivo tumor growth of xenografted CML cells harboring
either wild type Bcr-Abl or the IM-resistant T315I mutant
Bcr-Abl.

Proteasome inhibition but not ROS
induction is required for AF-induced
Bcr-Abl downregulation, caspase activation
and apoptosis in CML cells
Similar to other cancer cell lines we previously
reported [26], we found that AF induced accumulation
of ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome-specific
substrate proteins in a dose- and time-dependent manner
in KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cell lines; AF did not alter
the proteasome peptidases in KBM5 and KBM5-T315I
cells either (data not shown). It has been believed that
AF induces apoptosis via ROS generation, which was,
however, challenged by our most recent findings [30, 31].
Next we determined the roles of proteasome inhibition and
ROS in AF-induced cytotoxicity in CML cells. As shown
in Figure 5A, AF indeed induced ROS induction in CML
cells. Both thiol-containing antioxidants (NAC, GEE)
and non-thiol-containing antioxidants (Tbhq, Vitamin C)
could inhibit AF-induced ROS generation (Figure 5A);
however, only thiol-containing antioxidants but not nonthiol-containing antioxidants could completely block AFinduced proteasome inhibition, Bcr-Abl downregulation
and cell apoptosis (Figure 5B and C). These results
provide compelling evidence that proteasome inhibition
rather than ROS generation is required for AF-mediated

DISCUSSION
Acquired resistance to IM mediated by the
amplification and mutation of Bcr-Abl presents a great
challenge to the therapy of CML [32]. New generations

of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been designed (e.g.,
nilotinib, dasatinib, sunitinib, ponatinib and GZD824)
to overcome the acquired resistance to IM [33, 34].
Although these novel inhibitors can effectively inhibit
the phosphorylation of the mutated Bcr-Abl (E255K,
M351T), most of them had little effect on Bcr-AblT315I. In addition, Bcr-Abl cells are relatively resistant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to apoptosis induced by conventional cytotoxic agents
[35, 36]. All of these studies find that, CML, being
highly dependent on presence of Bcr-Abl, is one of
the typical models of oncogene addiction. Bcr-Abl
downregulation is the common effect and is likely
the major strategy to induce apoptosis in Bcr-Ablexpressing cells.

To search for an alternative therapy for IM-resistant
CML, particularly those harboring T315I mutant Bcr-Abl,
we evaluated a gold (I) thiolate compound AF, which has
been developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Recent research found that AF has antitumor activities
in a broad range of human cancer cells, including K562
cells expressing wild type Bcr-Abl [37]. In this study,
we reported that AF is highly effective in overcoming
IM-resistance in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In the
in vitro study, AF dose- and time-dependently decreased
cell viability, induced apoptosis and arrested cell cycle in
both IM-sensitive and -resistant cell lines; in the in vivo
experiment, both IM-sensitive and -resistant xenografted
tumors were all sensitive to AF treatment. These results
have clearly demonstrated that AF can efficiently induce
cytotoxicity in IM-resistant CML cells. To our knowledge,
this is the first report to show that AF is effective in vitro
and in vivo against CML cells, including those with the
T315I mutation. In present study, we used a solid-tumor
model which may be not as good as a non-solid leukemia
model. It will be important to test the in vivo effect of AF
on a non-solid leukemia model.
Based on these results, KBM5-T315I cells are
relatively more sensitive to AF than KBM5 cells. A possible
reason for this difference is that KBM5-T315I cells are
more malignant than KBM5 cells. It is well known that the
ubiquitin-proteasome system is more active in malignant
cells than in either less malignant or non-transformed
cells [38]; as a result, malignant cells are more sensitive
to proteasome inhibition [39]. AF is a proteasomal
deubiquitinase inhibitor and is therefore more cytotoxic to
KBM5-T315I cells than to KBM5 cells.
Moreover, we have unraveled that AF induces
cell apoptosis and overcomes IM-resistance in CML
cells through both Bcr/Abl-dependent and -independent
mechanisms. On one hand, AF inhibits the gene expression
of Bcr-Abl and AF-induced caspase activation cleaves BcrAbl (Figure 4A-C), leading to Bcr-Abl downregulation

and cell proliferation inhibition; on the other hand, as an
inhibitor of proteasome-associated DUBs, AF induced
proteasome inhibition-dependent activation of both the
intrinsic and the extrinsic caspase pathways (Figure 2
and Figure 5), causing apoptosis (Figure 7). Bcr-Abl is a
constitutively active tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates
several substrates, and activates multiple signal
transduction pathways. The downstream targets of STAT3
and STAT5 responsible for enhanced survival of Bcr-Abl
cells are involved in the transcription of Mcl-1, survivin
or Bcl-2 [40, 41]. Treatment with AF dose-dependently
resulted in down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins like
Bcl-2, survivin and XIAP, which leads to the decrease
of mitochondrial membrane integrity, thus inducing the
release of cytochrome C and AIF. The released apoptotic
factors either directly or by forming caspase-9 complex,
induced caspase activation. These processes have been
confirmed in our study. However, we did not see dramatic
decreases of Bcr-Abl downstream proteins Mcl-1 and
Bcl-xl. The mechanism remains unclear. As these two
proteins are also proteasome substrates, therefore we
proposed that discrepancy might be due to the balance
between protein expression and protein degradation.
More studies are needed to delineate the mechanism in
the future. AF treatment activated both the extrinsic
and intrinsic caspase systems, but caspase-8 activation
appears more in parallel to PARP cleavage than caspase-9;
therefore, it will be interesting to investigate the direct
effect of AF on caspase-8 activation in future studies. The
activated caspases, on one hand, induced PARP cleavage
and then apoptosis; on the other hand, they cleaved
Bcr-Abl protein. This is different from the mechanism
mediated by 20S proteasome inhibitors gambogic acid
or bortezomib. The 20S proteasome inhibitors have
been reported to be effective in overcoming IM-resistant
cancer cells via different mechanisms. CML cells that
express Bcr-Abl are more sensitive to the inhibition
of the proteasome with bortezomib than control cells.

Bortezomib treatment reduces the proliferation of
Bcr-Abl-expressing cells, by inactivating NF-κB and
decreasing the phosphorylation of Rb, eventually leading
to an increase in caspase-dependent apoptosis [42],
which is also correlated with accumulation of cells in the
G2/M phase of cell cycle, transient downregulation of
NF-κB DNA binding activity, downregulation of Bcl-xL,
activation of caspase 3, induction of apoptosis, inhibition
of the expression and phosphorylation of Bcr/Abl [27].
Unfortunately, bortezomib had minimal efficacy and
considerable toxicity in patients with imatinib-refractory
CML [43]. Another proteasome inhibitor gambogic
acid was reported to downregulate Bcr-Abl by caspasedependent Bcr-Abl cleavage and overcome IM-resistance
in CML cells [28]. To our knowledge, this is the first
report that proteasome-associated DUB inhibition by a
clinically used agent can overcome IM-resistance in vitro
and in vivo.
Lastly, we have confirmed in the present study
that proteasomal DUB inhibition rather than ROS
generation is responsible for AF-induced apoptosis in
CML cells. AF itself could increase ROS generation by
inhibiting thioredoxin reductase. In most of the previous
reports [17, 18, 44], it is believed that ROS elevation is
the cause of AF-induced apoptosis, based primarily on
that AF induction of apoptosis could be blocked using
NAC as the ROS scavenger. Therefore it is reasonable
to hypothesize that ROS plays an important role in AFmediated cell apoptosis in CML cells. However, we and
others have reported that thiol-containing antioxidant
NAC could both scavenge ROS and directly bind with the
active gold atom of AF, thus blocking the active site of AF,
including the DUB inhibition activity [26, 45]. To further
differentiate the effects of ROS and AF-mediated DUB
inhibition, we used two classical antioxidants including
thiol-containing (NAC, GEE) and non-thiol-containing
(Tbhq, Vitamin C) ones. These four antioxidants could
all scavenge AF-induced ROS generation, but based on
our results, only thiol-containing antioxidants but not
non-thiol-containing antioxidants could prevent AFinduced proteasome inhibition, Bcr-Abl downregulation
and apoptosis, demonstrating that DUB inhibition, rather
than ROS elevation, is the main mechanism by which AF
overcomes IM-resistance in CML cells as we previously
reported in other cancer cells [26].
New anticancer drugs are not only time-consuming
and costly to develop but also might not outperform
existing drugs. To help resolve this dilemma, Blagosklonny
has proposed a business model to develop existing drugs
for a novel use [46]. The present study has provided strong
evidence for this proposition. In summary, we demonstrate
here the action and the mechanisms by which AF, an old
anti-rheumatic drug, overcomes IM-resistance both in the
KBM5-T315I cell cultures and in the KBM5-T315I cell
xenografts. Given that AF has an established safety profile
in patients, these findings suggest for the first time that

AF may have potentially clinical benefit for CML patients,
particularly those suffering from imatinib-resistant and
recurrent forms of CML, providing great importance in
future clinical cancer therapy.

METHODS
Materials
AF,
N-acetyl-L-cysteine
(NAC),
Tertiary
butylhydroquinone (Tbhq), glutathione ethylene ester
(GEE), ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), Annexin V, propidium
iodide (PI) and rhodamine-123 were obtained from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). DCF-DA and z-VAD-fmk
were from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Antibodies
(Abs) against c-Abl (C-19), ubiquitin (P4D1), Mcl-1
(S-19), caspase-3, -8, -9, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF),
Bcl-2, Bax, GAPDH (FL-335) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against poly
(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP, clone 4C10-5) was
from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against phospho-c-Abl
at Y245, phospho-Erk1/2 (T202/Y204), Erk1/2, phosphoAkt, Akt, IκB-α, Bcl-xL, survivin, cleaved caspase-3,
-9, cytochrome C, and XIAP were from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Antibodies against
phospho-STAT5A/B (Y694/Y699, clone 8-5-2), STAT5,
and Ki67 were from Upstate Technology. Enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were purchased from
Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ, USA).

Cell culture
The culture of KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells
was described previously [13, 28, 47]. In brief, KBM5
cells expressing the 210 kDa wild-type Bcr-Abl was
derived from a female CML patient. The KBM5-T315I
cells, harboring a threonine to isoleucine substitution
at position 315 of Abl, were originally established by
exposure to increasing concentrations of IM and became
IM-resistant. KBM5 cells were cultured in Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Hyclone). KBM5-T315I
cells were routinely maintained in the same medium but
with 1 μmol/L IM, which was removed before experiments
with a wash-out period of 2 to 3 days.

Western blot analysis
Whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer
[13] (1 × PBS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS) supplemented with freshly added 10 mM
β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM
NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and
1 × Roche Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The cytosolic fraction was
prepared with digitonin extraction buffer (10 mM PIPES
9128

Measurement of reactive oxygen species
generation

[pH 6.8], 0.015% [wt/vol] digitonin, 300 mM sucrose,
100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described previously to
detect the level of cytochrome C and AIF in the cytosol
[13]. Western blotting was performed as we previously
described [13, 28].

ROS production was detected as previously
reported [26]. Cancer cells were treated with AF (2 μM)
in the absence or presence of antioxidants for 1 h. The
cells were harvested and incubated with the free serum
medium with addition of 10 μM of DCFH-DA for 20
min at 37°C in the dark. In the presence of ROS, DCFH
penetrates the cells and is in turn oxidized to DCF. DCF
fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry.

Cell viability assay
MTS assay (CellTiter 96Aqueous One Solution
reagent; Promega, Shanghai, China) was used to test cell
viability. 2×105/mL cells in 100 μL were treated with
increasing concentrations of AF for 48 hours, control cells
received DMSO for a final concentration the same as the
highest concentration of AF but less than 0.1%v/v. 4 hours
before culture end, 20 μL MTS was added to the wells.
The absorbance density was read on a 96-well plate reader
at wavelength 490 nm.

RNA isolation and Real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from 5×106 cells by
use of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). After quantification
by spectrophotometry, the first-strand cDNA was
synthesized from 500ng of total RNA with the use of the
RNA PCR Kit (AMV) Ver.3.0 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China)
and random primers. Then 50 ng of total cDNA was
use for real-time PCR with the SYBR Premix Ex Taq
II Kit (TaKaRa). Each PCR reaction was carried out in
a 20 μL volume on 96-well optical reaction plate. The
reaction was using the Roche Lighcycler 480 system.
The relative gene expression was analyzed by the
Comparative Ct method using 18s ribosomal RNA as
endogenous control, after confirming that the efficiencies
of the target and the endogenous control amplifications
were approximately equal. The specific primers
for real-time PCR are as follows: Bcr-Abl forward,
5′- AAG CGC AAC AAG CCC ACT GTC TAT-3′; Bcr-Abl
reverse, 5′-CTT CGT CTG AGA TAC TGG ATT CCT-3′;
18s forward, 5′-AAA CGG CTA CCA CAT CCA AG-3′;
18s reverse, 5′-CCT CCA ATG GAT CCT CGT TA-3′.

Cell death assay
KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of AF for indicated time periods,
0.4% Trypan blue was added to detect the number of death
cells under the light microscope.
Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry
using Annexin V-fluoroisothiocyanate (FITC)/PI double
staining [48, 49]. Cells were incubated with indicated
concentration or time duration of AF, collected and washed
with binding buffer (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), then
incubated in working solution (100 μL bingding buffer
with 0.3 μL Annexin V-FITC) for 15 min in dark. Cells
were washed and resuspended with binding buffer. PI
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added just before flow cytometric
analysis.

Nude mouse xenograft model

Cell cycle analysis

Nude Balb/c mice were bred at the animal facility
of Guangzhou medical university. The mice were housed
in barrier facilities with a 12 hours light dark cycle, with
food and water available ad libitum. 3×107 of KBM5 or
KBM5-T315I cells were inoculated subcutaneously on
the flanks of 5-week-old male nude mice as we previously
reported [28]. After 72 hours of inoculation, mice were
treated with either vehicle (10% DMSO, 30% cremophor
and 60% NaCl) or AF (7 mg/kg/day of body weight)
for 12 days. Tumors were measured every other day
using calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated using
the following formula: a2×b×0.4, where a is the smallest
diameter and b is the diameter perpendicular to a. The
body weight, feeding behavior and motor activity of each
animal were monitored as indicators of general health.
Tumor xenografts were immediately removed, weighed,
fixed, and stored. All animal studies were conducted
with the approval of the Guangzhou Medical University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle.
After drug treatment, cells were collected and fixed
overnight in 66% cold ethanol at -20°C. The cells were
then washed twice in cold PBS and stained with propidium
iodide for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle distribution
was determined using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with
the CellQuest software [13].

Measurement of mitochondrial membrane
integrity
The mitochondrial membrane potential of AFtreated and untreated cells was assayed by using
rhodamine-123 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) staining.
Cells were treated with various concentrations of AF for
24 hours and stained with 1 μM of rhodamine-123 for
1 hour at 37°C. Following the staining, the cells were
washed and harvested for flow cytometry analysis [28].

embedded in paraffin and sectioned according to standard
techniques. Tumor xenograft sections (4 μm) were
immunostained using the MaxVision kit (MaixinBiol)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primary
antibodies were for ubiquitin, IκB-α, c-Abl, or Ki67.
50 μL MaxVisionTM reagent was applied to each slide.
Color was developed with 0.05% diaminobenzidine and
0.03% H2O2 in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and the slides
were counterstained with hematoxylin. A negative control
for every antibody was also included for each xenograft
specimen by substituting the primary antibody with
preimmune rabbit serum.
