ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common movement disorders, and
currently there is no effective treatment that can slow disease progression. Preserving
and enhancing DA neuron survival is increasingly regarded as the most promising
therapeutic strategy for treating PD. IRX4204 is a second generation retinoid X
receptor (RXR) agonist that has no cross reactivity with retinoic acid receptors,
farnesoid X receptor, liver X receptors or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
PPARγ. We found that IRX4204 promotes the survival and maintenance of nigral
dopaminergic (DA) neurons in a dose-dependent manner in primary mesencephalic
cultures. Brain bioavailability studies demonstrate that IRX4204 can cross the blood
brain barrier and reach the brain at nM concentration. Oral administration of IRX4204
can activate nuclear receptor Nurr1 downstream signaling in the substantia nigra
(SN) and attenuate neurochemical and motor deficits in a rat model of PD. Our study
suggests that IRX4204 represents a novel, potent and selective pharmacological
means to activate cellular RXR-Nurr1 signaling and promote SN DA neuron survival
in PD prevention and/or treatment.

INTRODUCTION

4]; α-synuclein aggregation with Lewy body formation
in substantia nigra DA neurons is a main pathological
feature leading to DA neuron cell death [5]. The motor
symptoms of PD are believed to begin after 40-60%
of the dopamine cells in the substantia nigra (SN) pars
compacta are lost [6]. Progression of motor symptoms is
related to dopamine cell loss and can be assessed clinically
using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part
III (UPDRS-3), which is sensitive to treatment related
changes. Motor symptoms produce significant disability,
worsen quality of life, and advance even when treated
optimally with currently available symptomatic therapies.
Current therapies for PD are symptomatic treatments
for motor complications of the disease; to date there are no
disease modifying drug treatments conclusively shown to
be neuroprotective or that slow disease progression [7].

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most
common neurodegenerative disease of aging, which
currently affects approximately 1-2% of the world’s
population over age 65. The number of individuals with
PD is expected to double by 2030, affecting up to 9.3
million [1]. PD is associated with increased disability,
lower quality of life, increased mortality, and increased
healthcare costs across all stages of the disease. The
annual economic impact of PD in the United States alone
is estimated at $10.8 billion [2].
The molecular mechanisms underlying the disease
are unknown, but are likely to involve interactions
among genetic and environmental factors. The protein
α-synuclein is a central component in PD pathogenesis [3,

Rats were given the indicated dose of IRX4204 once a day through gavage and PK studies were conducted on day 1
and on week 4. n=3 per dose per data point per gender.
Deep brain stimulation dramatically improves “off” time
and dyskinesias, but has no effect on disease progression
and often worsens speech and balance [8, 9]. Even cellbased therapies, such as human fetal mesencephalic
dopaminergic cells, have not produced sustained benefit,
resulting in uncontrollable dyskinesias and Lewy body
degeneration of grafted fetal neurons [10]. Clearly, new
strategies are needed for disease modifying treatments
in PD, including novel mechanisms for decreasing the
burden of its pathological substrates.
The loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons
in the SN, leading to striatal dopamine deficiency, is one
of the prominent pathological features of PD. Therefore,
preserving or enhancing DA neuron survival provides
a therapeutic strategy against PD. There is increasing
evidence that activation of the nuclear receptor Retinoid
X Receptor (RXR) may protect against PD by providing
trophic support for DA neurons [11-13]. For example,
activation of RXR has been shown to protect cultured
DA neurons from degeneration in an in vitro model of
PD (6-hydroxy dopamine) and to hypoxia [14]. RXR is
known to interact with another orphan nuclear receptor,
nuclear receptor related-1 protein (Nurr1), forming RXRNurr1 heterodimers [15]. Nurr1 is a transcription factor
that is expressed in the embryonic ventral midbrain. In
developing DA cells, Nurr1 is required for the expression
of several genes important for dopamine synthesis and
function [16-20]. Nurr1 can activate the transcription
of tyrosine hydroxylase and enhance the expression
of dopamine transporters [21, 22], both of which are
significantly affected in PD condition. Therefore,
Nurr1 can be a potential target for the treatment of PD.
Observations associating Nurr1 mutations with familial
Parkinson’s disease confirm the importance of Nurr1
in the generation and maintenance of DA cells [23,
24]. Activation of RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers with RXR
agonists has been shown have been shown to induce RXRNurr1 mediated gene transcription and Nurr1 downstream
signaling associated with DA neuron function and
protection [15-17, 19, 25]. However, currently available
RXR ligands are not necessarily selective for RXR.
For example, the promising cancer drug, bexarotene, is
also a potent activator of retinoic acid receptors, LXR
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and PPAR-gamma [26, 27]; the non-selective nature of
currently available RXR agonists significantly limits their
clinical application [28-33]. In the present study, we show
that IRX4204, a novel RXR agonist, specifically binds to
RXR and is able to transactivate Nurr1. Most importantly,
for the first time, we report that oral administration of
IRX4204 prevents PD-type degeneration at molecular,
cellular and behavioral levels, following experimental DA
lesions in a rat model.

RESULTS
IRX4204 is a potent and specific RXR agonist
IRX4204 (Figure 1a) is a second generation RXR
agonist. We used the receptor transactivation assay to
test its specificity. We found that IRX4204 can partially
activate RXRs at a concentration of 0.1 nM and fully
activates all three RXRs (α, β and γ) at a concentration of
1 nM (Figure 1b). We also found that IRX4204 is thousand
times more potent for RXR than retinoic acid receptors
(RARα, β and γ, Figure 1b). It does not activate the
RXR heterodimers of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), liver
X receptors (LXR) α and β, or peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor PPARγ, which are responsible for most
of the side effects at physiological concentrations (Figure
1c-1e).

IRX4204 induces RXR-Nurr-1 transactivation
and promotes dopaminergic neuron survival in
primary VMB neuronal cells
We next tested the effect of IRX4204 on Nurr1
activation using COS7 cells transfected with reporter
plasmid and full length Nurr-1 with or without cotransfecting with full-length RXRα plasmid. We found
that in the absence of RXRα, the addition of IRX4204
resulted in a base level of reporter gene activation (Figure
2a), while in the presence of RXRα, IRX 4204 potently
(EC50 <1nM) activated reporter gene transcription in a

RXR dependent manner (Figure 2a), indicating that it is
an effective activator of RXR/Nurr1 heterodimers. We
next investigated the physiological effects of IRX4204
using primary neurons derived from ventral midbrain
(VMB). We found that IRX4204 treatment led to
increased survival of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive
DA neurons in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2b, left
panel) and that the effects were completely blocked by
co-treatment with the RXR antagonist HX531 (Figure 2b,
right panel). Moreover, treatment of the VMB neurons
with 1nM IRX4204 significantly increased the expression
of dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopa-decarboxylase
(DDC), and HX531 totally abolished the IRX4204mediated increased expression of these two genes (Figure
2c).

Acute and acute-on-chronic plasma pharmacokinetic
studies were conducted in rats following oral
administration of IRX4204. We found dose-proportional
increases in plasma IRX4204 levels (Table 1). However,
compared to single acute dosage, plasma concentrations
of IRX4204 were substantially lower following repeated
dosing, as summarized in Table 1. Both areas under the
curve (AUC) and Cmax values were significantly lower
following repeated dosing compared to single acute
treatment (Table 1). The increases in Cmax and AUC0were generally dose-proportional on Day 1, but were
24
not consistently proportional to the increases in the dose
during the following 4 weeks of treatment. Females had

higher Cmax and AUC0-24 values than males on both acute
and chronic treatments. For both genders, Week 4 Cmax
and AUC0-24 were substantially lower than those observed
on Day 1, suggesting changes in disposition of IRX4204
following multiple dose administration in rats. Plasma
protein binding, assessed by equilibrium dialysis, revealed
that IRX4204 is 99.36±0.07% bound in human plasma
and 97.51±0.77% in rat plasma. Our data demonstrate
changes in biodisposition of IRX4204 following chronic
administration in rats, gender differences in IRX4204
metabolism, and strongly support future pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic studies to further understand
the metabolism of IRX4204 in healthy and diseased
conditions.
We next tested whether IRX4204 could cross the
blood brain barrier in rats. Following 7 days repeated
dosing with 10 mg/kg/day, IRX4204 reached the brain at
nM concentrations (11.5±2.9nM), as assessed by LC/MS/
MS (Figure 3a). These nM concentrations of IRX4204 in
the brain were comparable to those found to promote VMB
DA neuron survival (Figure 2b) and to activate RXR/
Nurr1 in vitro without activating RARs, FXR, LXR and
PPARγ (Figure 1b-1e). We also found IRX4204 treatment
significantly increased mRNA levels of DA markers in the
SN of treated rats, including TH, DAT, DDC, paired-like
homeodomain transcription factor 3 (Pitx3), DJ-1(PARK7)
and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor,
GRFα1 (Figure 3b). There was also a trend towards

an increase of VMAT-2 (VMAT2) mRNA expression;
however, it did not reach statistical significance. Our data
suggest that IRX4204 at 10mg/kg/day is sufficient to
activate Nurr1-mediated DA neuroprotective mechanisms
in the rat brain following oral administration.

IRX4204 attenuates Parkinson-like phenotypes in
a rat model of PD
Based on this evidence, we tested the preclinical
efficacy of IRX4204 at 10mg/kg/day in a rat model of
PD. Using standard stereotaxic methodology, all rats were
unilaterally injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
in the right striatum and at three days post-lesion were
given either vehicle or 10mg/kg/day IRX4204 for three
weeks. Two independent behavioral tests were performed
to assess the effects of IRX4204 on the development of
hypokinetic motor dysfunction. As expected, all rats
developed asymmetric spontaneous use of the limb
contralateral to the striatal lesion in the cylinder test
three days post-lesion (Figure 4a, left panel). In vehicletreated animals, impairments persisted at day 17 and day
24 post-lesion (Figure 4a, left panel), while IRX4204
treatment significantly improved spontaneous forelimb
use to pre-lesion levels (p < 0.05, Figure 4a, left panel),
demonstrating that IRX4204 can reverse PD-like motor
deficits induced by 6-OHDA lesion. Apomorphine (APO)-

induced rotations were assessed as a second independent
behavioral measure. During baseline testing three days
post-lesion, both groups demonstrated comparable
APO-induced contralateral rotations (Figure 4a, right
panel). As expected, at day 24 post-lesion, APO-induced
rotations increased significantly by almost two-fold
compared to baseline among vehicle-treated rats (p <
0.01, Figure 4a right panel). In contrast, by day 24 post-

lesion for IRX4204-treated rats, the rotations did not
differ significantly from baseline (Figure 4a right panel).
Collectively, our data demonstrated that IRX4204 is
effective in protecting against 6-OHDA induced motor
asymmetry.
Following behavioral testing, rats were sacrificed
for brain pathology assessment. We found that
IRX4204 treatment significantly reduced the loss of

TH-immunoreactive neurons in the SN compared to the
vehicle-treated group (p < 0.05, Figure 4b). Measurements
of DAT and TH content in the striatum by Western blot
analysis showed that the vehicle-treated group lost
~40% DAT (59.6%±29.0% of the intact side) and ~60%
TH (40.2±21.6% of the intact side) in the lesioned side
compared to the non-lesioned side, while for the IRX4204
group, levels in the lesioned striatum were almost identical
to those in the non-lesioned side (Figure 4c). Striatal
dopamine loss in the lesioned side was much greater in
the vehicle-treated group relative to the IRX4204 group
(p < 0.01, Figure 4d, left panel). Compared to the nonlesioned side, dopamine turnover, as measured by the
ratios of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) or
homovanillic acid (HVA) to dopamine in the lesioned side,
was increased in the vehicle-treated group, while IRX4204
treatment significantly prevented these increases (p < 0.05,

ligands on DA neuron survival is thought to be mediated
by signal transduction involving the heterodimeric RXRNurr1 nuclear receptor [35, 36]. However despite all this
evidence, the development of preclinical and clinical
research strategies, aimed at promoting RXR-Nurr1
signaling using RXR agonists, has been hindered by
the non-selective nature of the currently available RXR
agonists. Most of the RXR agonists have cross-reactivity
with RAR, FXR, LXR or PPARγ. The lack of selectivity
of RXR agonists have been widely reported for unwanted
side effects, which inevitably preclude their development
in therapeutic applications for neurodegenerative
conditions, including PD [28-33]. Our study, for the
first time, strongly supports the characterization of a
highly selective RXR agonist, which can activate Nurr1mediated DA neuroprotective mechanisms in the brain at
nM concentration. We also found that oral administration
of IRX4204 can significantly increase the expression of
molecules that are important for dopamine biosynthesis
and metabolism, transport, and for DA neuron survival.
Preserving and enhancing DA neuron survival
is the most promising therapeutic strategy for treating
PD [37-39]. Our study demonstrates that IRX4204, a
highly selective RXR receptor agonist, can transactivate
nuclear factor Nurr1 and promote the expression of Nurr1
downstream genes associated with DA neuron function
and protection [16, 19, 35, 36]. Moreover, we found
that oral administration of IRX4204 attenuates PD-like
behavior phenotype and prevent DA neuron loss in a rat
model of PD.
We found that IRX4204 treatment can promote
the transcription of the receptor for the neurotrophic
agent GDNF. This is a very interesting observation, since
previous evidence suggests that GDNF failed to elicit
DA neuroprotection in a rat model of PD [40], possibly
due to α-synuclein mediated neurotoxicity, which was
hypothesized to down regulate the gene expression of
the GDNF receptor [41]. The failure of past translational
clinical application of GDNF in PD can be attributed to
this mechanism [42]. Thus, our data demonstrating that
oral administration of IRX4204 promotes GDNF receptor
expression provides evidence for a strong novel strategy
for PD therapy and possibly opens new avenues for
combinatory therapy with IRX4204 and GDNF.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that IRX4204
can penetrate the brain through the blood brain barrier and
attenuate PD phenotypes, including neurochemical and
motor deficits, in a rat model of PD. Based on the high
specificity and potency, the current study suggests that
IRX4204 is a highly promising agent for the treatment
of PD. Differences in PK between male and female
rats are not unusual; however, they can potentially
influence the outcome of the treatment efficacy. Future
work will continue to assess the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of IRX4204, which will include
both sexes, to determine whether the PK differences lead

DISCUSSION
Since the discovery of striatal dopamine loss as the
main cause of the motor symptoms of parkinsonian, PD
therapies have been mainly directed to treat the symptoms
focused on the dopamine system. Until now, treatment
with L-DOPA to increase the synthesis, storage and
release of dopamine in the surviving DA neurons remains
the gold standard. Most of the dopatherapies lose their
effect with disease progression and patients usually suffer
from serious side effects such as involuntary movements
[34]. The introduction of dopamine receptor agonists
such as ropinirole and pramipexole to reduce the risk of
dyskinesia led to the identification of more severe side
effects including psychiatric disorders. More recently,
surgical therapy targeting the basal ganglia circuitry, such
as deep brain stimulation, is also found to be associated
with significant side effects. Despite the advances of the
current therapeutic approaches targeting the DA system,
it is clear that current PD therapies do not reduce the rate
or extent of DA neuron loss and have no effect on disease
progression. Therefore, neuroprotective interventions able
to protect DA neurons and delay disease progression have
been actively sought after over the past two decades [7].
The urgent need for novel therapeutic agents for treating
PD is further stressed in light of the recent failed phase III
creatine clinical trial (http://parkinsontrial.ninds.nih.gov/
netpd-LS1-study-termination.htm).
In this study, we characterized the highly selective
RXR agonist, IRX4204 in protecting DA neurons.
Nurr1 is a transcription factor critical for DA neuron
development and maintenance, and Nurr1 depletion
leads to specific DA neuron loss in the ventral midbrain
[17, 18, 20]. RXR ligands have been shown to improve
DA neuron survival in various in vitro models of DA
neurodegeneration [14]. The protective benefit of RXR

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Eight week old male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats,
weighing 225-250g were housed, one to three per cage,
with ad libitum food and drinking water and 12:12 hour
light:dark cycle. All procedures were approved by the
committee for Ethical Conduct in the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.

Animals

Receptor transactivation assay
For RXR: CV-1 cells were transfected with
rCRBPII/RXRE-tk-Luc reporter gene and an expression
vector for RXRα, β, or γ. For RAR: CV-1 cells were
transfected with ERE-tk-Luc reporter gene and an
expression vector for the appropriate ER-RARα, β,
or γ. ER-RARs are fusion proteins, composed of the
estrogen receptor (ER) DNA binding domain fused
to the ligand binding domain of RARs. This system
eliminates interference by the low level of endogenous
RAR activity in CV1 cells as the readout comes only from
the transfected ER-RAR. For PPARγ: CV-1 cells were
transfected with 3x(rAOX/DR1)-tk-Luc reporter gene
and an expression vector for PPARγ; for FXR: CV-1 cells
were transfected with 3x(IBABP/IR1)-tk-Luc reporter
gene and vectors for FXR and RXRα; for LXR: CV-1 cells
were transfected with 3x(PLTP/LXRE)-tk-Luc reporter
gene with vectors for LXRα or LXRβ. For Nurr1: COS7
cells were transfected with 3xNBRE-tk-luc reporter gene
and full length Nurr1 with or without full-length RXRα
plasmid. Cells were then treated with vehicle or IRX4204
for 20h. Luciferase data were normalized to co-transfected
β-gal activity. Luciferase activity is expressed as percent
of maximal activity obtained using specific agonists 9-cisretinoic acid (RXR), retinoic acid (RAR), rosiglitazone
(PPARγ), GW4064 (FXR), T0901317 (LXR).

Plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and plasma
protein binding assay
SD male rats were grouped into four groups:
vehicle, 1mg/kg/day, 3mg/kg/day and 10mg/kg/day.
Rats were treated with the designated dose by daily
gavage. Acute plasma PK was conducted on day one and
acute-on-chronic plasma PK was conducted on day 24.
Pharmacokinetic assessment was conducted by collecting
of blood at baseline (prior gavage), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12
and 24h post gavage. Plasma protein binding to IRX4204
was conducted using the rapid equilibrium dialysis device
and K3EDTA control plasma of rat, human was spiked
with 1ug/ml IRX4204. The spiked plasma was dialyzed
at 37°C against an isotonic sodium phosphate buffer to
achieve equilibrium. At the end of dialysis, the plasma and
buffer level of IRX4204 were quantified by LC/MS/MS.

IRX4204 content in the brain
Male SD rats underwent daily gavage with 10mg/kg/
day for seven days. One hour after the last dose, rats were
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and transcardially
perfused with cold saline. Brains were isolated and
homogenized with two volumes of phosphate buffer using
ultrasonication. A 100μl sample of the homogenate was
transferred to a 1.7ml centrifuge tube and mixed with
20μl of internal standard (100ng/ml of 13-cis retinoic
acid-d5 in diluent). Then the sample was deproteinized
with 300μl of acetonitrile, centrifuged, and the supernatant
was transferred to an autosampler vial for analysis by
LC/MS/MS. The calibration standards and the internal
standard (13-cis retinoic acid-d5) were diluted in aceton
itrile:butylatedhydroxyanisole:ethoxyquin:triethylamine
(100:0.05:0.02:0.1, v/w/v/v).

Primary culture
Ventral midbrain (VMB) from E13.5-14.5 C57BL/6
mouse embryos were dissected, triturated and plated on
poly-D-lysine coated 12 well plates or glass coverslips
with the serum-free chemically-defined Neurobasal
medium, supplemented with 2% B27, 0.5mM L-glutamine,
50I.U./ml penicillin and 50μg/ml streptomycin (GibcoBRL). For gene expression, cells were treated with 1nM
IRX4204 or vehicle with or without RXR antagonist
HX531 (100nM) for 16 hours following three days in
vitro (DIV). For DA neuron survival study, cells were
treated with various concentrations of IRX4204 or vehicle
following 2 DIV. For each time point, cells were washed
once with phosphate buffered saline and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for TH immunofluorescent staining.
For cell counting, 10 frames were randomly captured
from each well using a Leica fluorescent microscope and
a minimum of four replicates for each dose and each time

LC/MS/MS analysis
LC/MS/MS analysis of the samples was conducted
by initial separation of the IRX4204 peaks on an HPLC
column prior to detection by the mass spectrometer.
The LC/MS system was comprised of Waters Acquity

coupled to a XEVO-TQS (Waters). The samples were
analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Waters Atlantis
T3 column (150 x 2.1mm, 5um). The mobile phase was
nebulized using heated nitrogen in a Z‑spray source/
interface set to electrospray negative ionization mode.
The ionized compounds were detected using MS/MS.
Standard calibration curve was obtained by spiking known
concentrations of IRX4204 to the naïve brain matrix. The
detection was linear between 2.5nM to 10nM.

Apomorphine (APO)-induced rotations were
performed as described by Fisher et al. [44]. Briefly,
immediately after apomorphine injection (0.5 mg/kg body
weight), animals were placed in an open area. A camera
monitored the animal behavior and computerized software
analyzed the number of contralateral and ipsilateral
rotations in 30 minutes testing. Rotations were assessed
three days post-lesion and after three weeks of treatment
(24 days post-lesion). Data were expressed as average
contralateral turns per minute.
The cylinder test was used to test for forelimb use
asymmetry. Rats to be tested were placed individually
in a glass cylinder (21 cm diameter, 34 cm height) and
wall exploration was recorded for five minutes. Wall
exploration was expressed in terms of the percentage of
impaired (right) forelimb vs. total (right+left+both) usage.
Paw placement test was performed before the lesion for
baseline, three days post lesion and two weeks and three
weeks following treatment.

Quantification of gene expression by real time
PCR
Total RNA from VMB neurons or rat substantia
nigra were isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit from
Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and 1µg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis
supermix for qRT-PCR from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Quantitative
RT-PCR was performed using Maxima SYBR Green
master mix (Fermentas) in ABI Prism 7900HT in four
replicates with primers amplifying the target genes.
Expression level of actin was used as an internal control.
Data were normalized using the 2-ΔΔCt method [43]. Levels
of target gene mRNAs were expressed relative to those
in vehicle control groups and plotted in GraphPad Prism.

Immunohistochemistry and cell counting
The caudal portion of the brains were sectioned
in the coronal plane on a cryostat at 12 µm. From a
random start corresponding to SNpc position, every 12th
section was selected -, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and processed for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining
using mouse monoclonal anti-TH antibody (1:2000,
Chemicon)[45] and the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector
Lab) according to manufacturer’s instruction. TH positive
neurons were counted as described [46].

Surgical procedure
All surgical procedures were performed under
general anesthesia with ketamine/xylazine. 2μl 6-OHDA
(20 mg/ml in 0.02% ascorbic acid) was stereotaxically
injected into the right striatum of male SD rats. Lesion
coordinates were set according to bregma and dura in
mm: ML-3.7; AP-1.0; DV-5.5. The injection rate was
2μl/5 min and the injecting needle was left for 2 minutes
after injection to avoid back flow. Apomorphine-induced
rotations (see below) were assessed three days post-lesion
and rats with ≥ 30 full contralateral rotation/30 minutes
were included in the study.

Measurements of dopamine and metabolites in
the striatum by HPLC
The left and right striatum were isolated and
homogenized with artificial cerebrospinal fluid and
centrifuged at x10,000 g for 15 minutes. Protein content
of the supernatant was measured by Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad). Dopamine, HVA and DOPAC were measured
using an isocratic HPLC system with electrochemical
detection, consisting of a pump (ESA model 582 [ESA
Chelmsford, MA]), automatic injector (ESA model 542
Autosampler), and a Coulochem III detector (ESA) in
conjunction with a guard cell (ESA model 5020) and an
analytical cell (ESA model 5014B). Cell potentials were
set at +350mV, -150mV, and +220mV respectively for
the guard, E1 and E2 cells. A volume of 20μl per sample
was injected with a flow rate of 0.6ml/minute, and passed
through a 150mm column (ESA model MD-150X3.2)
with a particle size of 3μm and pore size of 120Å. Mobile
phase consisted of 10% acetonitrile, 90mM NaH2PO4,

Drug treatment
Rats were randomly grouped into vehicle control
group (n = 11) and drug treatment group (n = 10). Rats
were given 10mg/kg body weight /day IRX4204 by daily
intragastric gavage using plastic feeding tubes and the
treatment started on post-lesion day four. The control
group received DMSO/corn oil (vehicle). The treatment
continued for three weeks.

Immunoblot analysis
Striatum samples were homogenized and boiled in
SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated onto 10% Trisglycine gels. Western blotting was performed using antiTH or anti-DAT (Millipore, Billerica, MA), as primary
antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence signals were
quantified and normalized with β-actin.
