ABSTRACT
Harmine is a beta-carboline alkaloid found in medicinal plant PeganumHarmala,
which has served as a folk anticancer medicine. However, clinical applications of
harmine were limited by its low pharmacological effects and noticeable neurotoxicity.
In this study, we modified harmine to increase the therapeutic efficacy and to
decrease the systemic toxicity. Specifically, two tumor targeting harmine derivatives
2DG-Har-01 and MET-Har-02 were synthesized by modifying substituent in
position-2, -7 and -9 of harmine ring with two different targeting group2-amino-2deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) and Methionine (Met), respectively. Their therapeutic efficacy
and toxicity were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Results suggested that the
two newharmine derivatives displayed much higher therapeutic effects than nonmodified harmine. In particular, MET-Har-02 was more potent than 2DG-Har-01 with
promising potential for targeted cancer therapy.

β-carboline derivatives with limited success [8–17].
This work summarizes our efforts on the production of
harmine derivatives via targeted modifications to improve
its cancer targeting effects.
The tumor targeting natural product derivatives
have played an important role for the enhanced tumor
therapy [18–22]. Our previous studies demonstrated that
2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) and methionine (Met)
exhibited wide-spectrum tumor targeting ability due to the
high metabolic process in various tumor cells [23–24]. It
has been commonly acknowledged that the introduction
of glucose leads to increased efficiency in tumor uptake
[25]. Indeed, 18FDG as tumor targeting agent has been
widely applied in clinicaldiagnosis [26–29]. It is well
established that 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), a
glucose analog, can be recognized and transported into the
cells by GLUT1 on the cell membrane [30]. The absence
of hydroxyl group in position 2 of 2DG hampers the
isomerization in the enzyme-catalytic metabolic pathway

INTRODUCTION
There is an increasing interest in discovering
novel antitumor agents from natural resources. Harmine
(7-methoxy-1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3, 4-b]indole), a naturally
occurring β-carboline, was previously isolated from a
medicinal herbal PeganumHarmala traditionally used
in the Middle East and North Africa [1, 2]. Studies in
the past decade revealed that harmine possesses potent
anti-proliferative and cytotoxic properties. However,
harmine's severe neurotoxic effects in animal models
impeded  its  development toward the clinical wide
application [3–5].
As a small molecule, harmine may easily penetrate
into cells by diffusion. However, harmine shows no tumor
specificity, which may be responsible for its weak anticancer effects and serious systemic side effects [6–7].
To overcome such drawbacks, intensive research efforts
have been placed on the design and synthesis of novel

and results in the retention ofphosphorylated molecule
within the cell.
Methionine (Met), a sulfur containing essential
amino acid indispensable for the growth and development
of mammals, has been shown to play many critical roles
in mammalian metabolism [31]. Methionine is transported
by LAT1 and LAT2 receptors which are highly expressed
in many malignant cell membranes [32]. Because of the
metabolic defect in methionine production, exogenous
methionine is essential to the growth of many malignant
cell lines whereas the growth of non-cancerous cells
is generally methionine independent. Therefore, 2DG
and Met were used in this study as targeting groups to
produce  harmine derivatives with improved tumor
selectivity.
Studies have proved that a high cytotoxic potency
is associated with compounds placing hydrophobic bulky
groups in position-2, -7 and -9 of harmine ring. The
modifications of -2 and -9 site of harmine could enhance
the antitumor activity. Thus, the methoxy- substituent
at position-7 of beta-carboline might contribute to the
significant neurotoxic side effect. On the other hand,
the prolonged substituents at position-7 eliminated
neurotoxic effects completely [9–10].
In this study, we designed and synthesized two
novel targeting antitumor agents bearing 2DG and Met
in position-7, phenpropyl in position-9 and benzyl in
position-2 of harmine ring. The antitumor activity and
neurotoxicity of these novel compounds were assessed.
Subsequently, the cell targeting mechanism of the new
harmine derivatives was investigated.

Synthesis and characterization of
2DG-Har-01 and MET-Har-02
2DG-Har-01 and MET-Har-02 were synthesized
by following the series of steps as depicted (Fig. 1A).
The N9-alkylated harmine derivative 2 was prepared
according to the synthetic protocol described before [33].
The preparation of compounds 3 followed a common
synthetic scheme [34], characterized by demethylation
of compounds 2 using acetic acid and hydrobomic
acid as reaction solvent. To modify the molecules with
2DG and Met, a key intermediate, the alky halide, was
designed. Compound 4 was obtained by O-alkylation of
compound 3 in the presence of cesium carbonate with the
ethyl bromoacetate. Then, hydrolyzation of compound 4
lead to the production of –COOH-functionalized
compound 5. Finally, 2DG-Har-01 and compound 6
were synthesized with the conjunction of 2DG and Met,
respectively. MET-Har-02 is the N2-benzylated product
of compound 6. The successful synthesis of 2DG-Har-01
and MET-Har-02 were evidenced by MS (Fig.1B, 1C) and
1
H NMR (Fig. 1D, 1E). The molecular weights of 2DGHar-01 and MET-Har-02 are 536 and 596, respectively
(Fig. 1B, 1C).

We investigated the anticancer effects of 2DGHar-01, MET-Har-02 on five human cancer cell lines

(SMMC-7721, HuH7, HepG2, LOVO and MCF-7). The
original harmine and common recognized anticancer drug
5-fu were used as control. As shown in Fig. 2A-2E, the
modified harmine derivatives, 2DG-Har-01 and METHar-02, showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in
different concentrations. 2DG-Har-01 showed improved
antitumor activities than harmine controls on LOVO
and SMMC-7721 cells. On the other hand, MET-Har-02
displayed stronger antitumor activity than harmine
controls and 5-fu on all cell lines, especially hepatocellular
carcinoma cells (SMMC-7721, HuH7).
Most importantly, unlike harmine control and 5-fu,
the targeting compounds 2DG-Har-01 and MET-Har-02
showed slight cytotoxicity on the normal human liver
cell L-02 even at the highest concentration (200 μM)
(Fig. 2F). These highly selective toxicity results support
that 2DG-Har-01 and MET-Har-02 might be uptaken
mostly by cancer cells rather than normal cells. The effect
of MET-Har-02 and harmine on cancer cells was further
investigated using clone formation assay on HepG2 cells.
After treated with indicated concentration of MET-Har-02
and harmine for 7 days, the number of clones formed was
significantly decreased compared with the control group,
(Fig. 2G, 2H). At 5 μM, both MET-Har-02 and harmine
were found to inhibit HepG2 cells’ colony formation while
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MET-Har-02 showed superior suppression effect than
harmine. No colony was found when the concentration of
MET-Har-02 was raised to 10 μM.

The apoptosis assay of harmine
and MET-Har-02
Further studies were carried out to seek the potential
processes governing the anti-tumor effect of MET-Har-02
and harmine. Since many anticancer drugs cause the death
of tumor cells through the induction of apoptosis, we thus
assume that MET-Har-02 promotes cancer cell apoptosis.
This hypothesis was tested using HepG2 cell line. As
expected, the treatment of MET-Har-02 and harmine
both decreased the survival of HepG2 Cells (stained
with hoechst) and the cell survival rates were decreased
with increasing the compounds concentrations (from 0 to
10  μM) (Fig. 3A). It also suggested that the antitumor
activity of MET-Har-02 is better than the hamrine’s (the
amounts of the cells in the same concentration).
Morphological analysis was performed after METHar-02 and harmine treatment for 48 hours. HepG2 Cells
were stained with Hoechst33342 for 20 mins and observed
through the confocal laser scanning microscope. As shown
in (Fig. 3B). The density of cells was decreased with the

mice after 16 days treatment confirmed the in vivo tumor
measurements (Fig. 4B). Body weight and survive rate
usually reflect the health condition of the treated mice.
The body weight of mice in the control group (salinetreated) began to decrease from the 8th dayafter injection
(Fig. 4C), which indicated the living quality of the mice
was compromised by the tumor burden. For the 2DGHar-01 and MET-Har-02 treated groups, the body weight
gradually increased during the treatment period, implying
that the systemic toxicity was minimal in these mice.
A slightly decrease of body weight in the harmine group
was observed at the end of the treatment period. During
the in vivo studies of 16 days (Fig. 4D), no mice died with
the 2DG-Har-01 treatment. For the same duration, the
survival rate of MET-Har-02 group was 90% and harmine
group was 80% while only 30% of animals survived with
saline injection. These results support that the newly
synthesized targeting reagents 2DG-Har-01 and METHar-02 treatment may prolong the life expectance of S180
tumor-bearing mice.
Similarly the antitumor efficacy of MET-Har-02
was also investigated on the MCF-7 tumor bearing nude
mice. As shown in Fig. 4E, the tumor volume indicated

24 h, the amount of cells in the right bottom quadrant
(cells in early apoptosis) increased by 21% (Fig. 3C
and 3D). When the concentration of MET-Har-02 was
increased to 15 μM, almost the entire early apoptotic cells
were transformed into late apoptosis (Fig. 3C and 3D).
Apoptosis was also observed in cells treated with harmine.
Even at the presence of 15 μM harmine, only 7% cell
apoptosis was observed (Fig. 3D). The early apoptosis to
late apoptosis was estimated to be 1:1 ratio.

In vivo antitumor activity of 2DG-Har-01
and MET-Har-02
The in vivo anti-tumor efficiency of 2DG-Har-01
and MET-Har-02 were evaluated in S180 tumor-bearing
mice following the procedures described in section
method. As shown in Fig. 4A, the tumor growth was
significantly reduced in the mice groups treated with 2DGHar-01, MET-Har-02 and Harmine compared with salineinjection control group. Among all treatments, METHar-02 showed highest tumor inhibition ratio (67.86%)
compared to 2DG-Har-01 (42.84%) and Harmine
(30.93%) treatment. The tumors isolated from the subject

that MET-Har-02 exhibited higher tumor inhibition
ratio than harmine, with the inhibitionratios of 63.5%
(MET-Har-02) and 35% (harmine). The body weights of
subjected nude mice were plotted in Fig. 4F. Compared
to the saline group, the MET-Har-02 group didn’t
show  obvious reduction of weight during the 21 days.
The 21-day survival rates of micebearing MCF-7 tumors
in the MET-Har-02 and harmine groups were 80% and
70%, respectively, whereas in the control group only
one nude mouse was still alive on the 21th day (Fig. 4G).
We also performed the pathological examination on the
tumor tissues (Fig. 4H). The result showed pronounced
pathological changes in the MET-Har-02 group. The most
amounts of the tumor cells were dead in the central of the
issue and the volume of the surrounding cells decreased
obviously, which was similar to the results of antitumor
efficacy in the study above.

of organ weight/body weight) of the major organs (heart,
liver, spleen, lung and kidney) in animals treated with
500  mg/Kg 2DG-Har-01, MET-Har-02, in the 10th day
after injection (Fig. 5C). As expected and in consistent
with the animal weight results, the administration of
harmine significantly increased liver weight indicating
liver toxicity (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, two modified
harmine derivatives did not render any significant changes
in the organs compared with the control group, except a
slight swelling of liver in MET-Har-02 treated animals.
To further study the acute toxicity, the serum levels and
pathological assay for the main organs were investigated
at 10 days after injection of different compounds. As
shown in Fig. 5D, the serum levels of AST, ALT, CK and
BUN in the harmine treated mice group demonstrated
significant elevation (p < 0.01), while only slight
increasing were observed in the MET-Har-02 treated mice
group for AST, ALT, BUN. The levels of CK induced
by MET-Har-02 were almost the same with the control
group, indicating low toxicity of the modified compound
MET-Har-02. To confirm the toxicity, we also did the
histological examination for the main organs (heart,
liver, lung and kidney) from the above three groups (10/
group) (Fig. 5E). The heart and lung showed no obvious
pathological changes in mice of all the three groups. In the
liver examination, no pathological damage was observed
in the saline and MET-Har-02 group, but a little hepatic
edema was found in the harmine group. The observation
of kidney revealed a little pathological damage in both
harmine and MET-Har-02 groups. However, the damage
in harmine group was more serious than that in the METHar-02 group.

Neurotoxic and acute toxicities assay
on normal mice
Neurotoxic of 2DG-Har-01, MET-Har-02 and
harmine were evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. As
shown in Table 1, the healthy mice treated with 2DGHar-01 and MET-Har-02 (10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 mg/
kg, i.p.) did not exhibit signs of neurotoxicity, such as
tremor, tetanus, twitch, jumping, supination and death
during the 10-day observation. As expected, the mice
receiving 100 mg/kg harmine exhibited neurotoxic
behaviors immediately (Table 1). Moreover, the nerve cell
toxicity of these compounds was assessed using PC12 rat
neural cells and MTT assay (Fig. 5A). The study showed
that the cell survival rate of harmine treated group was
39%, while 2DG-Har-01 and MET-Har-02 treated groups
were more than 80% at the drug concentration of 200 μM.
These observations suggested that the modified harmine
derivatives 2DG-Har-01 and MET-Har-02 have reduced
neural toxicity.
Further, the acute toxicities were investigated.
Compared with the saline control group, the animal body
weight after the treatments of 2DG-Har-01 and  METHar-02 even at the high concentration of 500 mg/kg
displayed a regular increasing trend, without obvious
toxicity (Fig. 5B). In contrast, harmine treated mice group
exhibited the inhibited growth (Fig. 5B). Further study
was carried out to determine the organ coefficient (ratio

DISCUSSION
In this study, we presented the derivative synthesis
of harmine, a beta-carboline alkaloid, with both molecular
modification and targeting agent conjunction  [10].
The purpose of the molecular alteration was to acquire
new compounds of highly potent antitumor activity and
low neural and systemic toxicity. Previous studies have
concluded that a higher antitumor efficacy potency
of harmine is associated with the compounds bearing
hydrophobic bulky groups in position-7 and -9. However,
the methoxy substituent at position-7 of beta-carboline
might be responsible for their severe neurotoxic effect.

To eliminate the neural toxic effects, harmine derivatives
were synthesized with prolonged substituents at
position-7. The 2DG and MET as the tumor targeting
agent were documented in our previous studies. Indeed,
the conjugation of 2DG at position-7 using a reaction
linkage with methyl bromoacetate significantly increase
the tumor cell uptake ability and decrease the neurotoxicity
effect. And furthermore we added a hydrocinnamyl at
position-9 to enhance the cytotoxicity of the compounds
[2, 8]. As anticipated, our results showed that 2DG-Har-01
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

had better antitumor activity than harmine. To further
improve the anti-tumor property, MET-Har-02 bearing
N2-benzylated modification in position 2 was produced.
Benzyl in position-2 of harmine was reported to have
significant contribution to the anti-proliferation effect
of harmine derivatives [3, 8, 10, 20]. It should be noted
that, possibly due to the steric hindrance of 2DG, benzyl
cannot be modified on the position-2 of 2DG-Har-01 (the
stereospecific blockade and demonstrated by our study).
Both our in vitro and in vivo results support that both

derivatives, MET-Har-02 and 2DG-Har-01, have superior
antitumor property and cell/animal safety than harmine.
These all in vitro and in vivo experiment results
have manifested that structural modification in position 2,
7, 9 of harmine could improve the antitumor activity and
decrease the side effects of the compounds. The reason of
the ideal results is that the targeting agent modifications
reduce the uptake of other organs and the molecular
modifications enhance the antitumor activity to the
cancer cells.
Subsequent work was emphasized on identifying
the antitumor mechanism of MET-Har-02. Since harmine
and many other beta-carboline agents have been shown
to kill tumor cells by launching apoptosis [21], we have
hypothesized that MET-Har-02 trigger cancer cells
undergone apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported by
several observations. Firstly, Annexin V-FITC/PI double
labeling assay showed that different concentration of
MET-Har-02 induced apoptosis on different phases.
These results were also confirmed by Hoechst staining.
Second, while non-treated cells fully stretched and showed
normal volume, treated ones showed typical apoptotic
cell morphology with shrunk, turned round, presented
condensed nuclear and margination. These finding
supports our assumption that the anti-proliferative effects
of MET-Har-02 may be attributable to its induction of
apoptotic cell death.
Apoptosis may be mediated by different pathways.
Briefly, caspase, a family of cysteine proteases, is an integral
part of the apoptotic pathway. Moreover, mitochondria
mediated apoptosis is precisely regulate by Bcl-2 family
proteins. Furthermore, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio is known as the
‘molecule trigger’ of apoptosis [35]. Interestingly, METHar-02 has insignificant influence on the ratio of Bcl-2/
Bax. These results indicate that MET-Har-02 may have no
effect on the Bcl family proteins in HepG2 cell at the test
condition (Supplementary materials 1)
It is well known that cell apoptosis and the cell cycle
are tightly linked. According to former researches, several
beta-carboline compounds, including harmine, change the
cell cycle thorough specific inhibition of CDKs which are
crucial molecules in the regulation of different phases of
the cell cycle [36]. Our data showed that MET-Har-02
caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase of HepG2 cell,
which was distinct from the known antitumor effect of
harmine. In addition, wound scratch results have shown
that the MET-Har-02 suppresses tumor metastasis even at
a low concentration of 5 μM (Supplementary materials 2).

Proliferation inhibition assays
The effect of products 2DG-Har-01 and METHar-02 on human cancer cell growth were carried out on
HepG2, SMMC-7721, HuH7, LOVO, MCF-7 and L02
using MTT assay according to the following procedures.
Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well in
96-well plates and incubated overnight. Cells were then
incubated with indicated concentration of 2DG-Har-01
MET-Har-02, or controls (harmine or 5-FU) for 48 h. Five
replicates were performed for each concentration. MTT
solution (5 mg/mL) was add each well. After incubation
for 4 h, the medium was discarded and the formazan
crystals was dissolved in 100 μL DMSO. The plates
were shaken for 15 min. The optical density (OD) value
was measured at 490 nm with a microplate reader. The
proliferation rate was calculated by the following equation:
proliferation rate (%) = (ODtreated/ODcontrol) × 100%.

Colony formation assay
HepG-2 cells were trypsinized and seeded in 6-well
microplates (500 cells/well) in 2 mL of complete RPMI1640 and were examined microscopically to confirm that
only single cell without clumps had been plated. Then
thecellswere treated with theindicated concentrations METHar-02 and harmine for 7 days. During colony growth, the
culture medium was replaced every 3 days. Finally, the
cells were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal
violet. Imagesof thecolonies were captured by a digital
camera. Colonies were visualized by microscopy with an

the equation: colony formation rate = (number of colonies/
number of seeded cells). Each test was repeated in triplicate.

Wt stand for the average tumor weight for control group
and treatment group, respectively.
After the antitumor activity assay performed on the
Kunming mice, we also conducted the experiment on the
nude mice which were injected with human breast tumor
cells MCF-7. Similarly, the tumor bearing nude mice were
also divided into 3 groups (n = 10) and treated on days 7,
11, 15 and 19 post –inoculation by the same procedures as
Kunming mice group, with the dose of 20 mg/kg harmine
and MET-Har-02. The therapeutic efficacies were assessed
by measuring tumor volume and body weight every other
day till the 21th day and the survival rate were recorded.

Apoptosis analysis
HepG-2 cells growing on 6-well dishes were treated
with chemicals in the presence or absence of harmine and
MET-Har-02 for 24 h and total cells were collected. The
percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated by staining 1 ×
106 cells with annexin V-FITC (Beyotime) and propidium
iodide (Beyotime) in binding buffer for 10 min at room
temperature in the dark. The samples were analyzed
by flow cytometry (FACScalibur, Becton–Dickinson)
within 1 h to determine the percentage of cells displaying
annexin V+/propidium iodide-(early apoptosis) or annexin
V-/propidium iodide + staining(late apoptosis). Three
independent experiments were performed for each assay
condition.

Histology examination
To further investigate the side effects of harmine
and MET-Har-02 on various organs of the treated mice,
histological analysis of different organs was conducted by
the established technique.

Acute toxicities assay
The acute toxicity of 2DG-Har-01, MET-Har-02
and harmine (as control) to animal subjects were
investigated on the normal mice. Briefly, 30 Kunming
mice (aged 3–4 weeks, weighed 18–22 g, equal number
of male and female subjects) were divided randomly
into 4 groups including the control group. Mice in the
control group were injected with PBS buffer (0.2 mL).
The mice were given an ip injection of 10, 50, 100,
200 and 500 mg/kg of 2DG-Har-01, MET-Har-02 and
harmine in 0.2 mL of 0.9% saline. After administration,
the mice were observed thoroughly for the onset of any
immediate neural toxicities and delayed effects. The mice
were monitored continuously for 10 days to observe any
abnormal behaviors or death. All animals were sacrificed
on the 10th day and checked macroscopically for possible
damage to the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidneys. The
weight changes of the tissues and bodies were assessed
and compared. Blood was drawn from the eye socket.
The serum biochemical parameters including aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinekinase (CK)
indexes of the blood samples were examined.

Morphological assay
About 3 × 105 HepG-2 tumor cells were seeded at
the confocal petri dish and incubated at 37°C for 24  h
and treated with MET-Har-02 for 24 h. Hoechst 33342
(Beyotime) were added in 30 mins advance before laser
confocal microscopy observation (LCFM, FluoViewTM
FV1000, Olympus, Japan)

In vivo antitumor activity analysis
by tumor xenograft model
S180 cells (5 × 106) were subcutaneously injected
into the Kunming mice (n = 10 per group).As the tumors
grew up to a diameter of 0.2–0.5 cm, the mice were used
for treatment. The active compound 2DG-Har-01 and
MET-Har-02 were tested for in vivo antitumor activity
in the Ehrlich solid carcinoma (S180) assay model,
while harmine and normal saline (NS) were used as the
positive and negative controls respectively. The effect
of 2DG-Har-01 and MET-Har-02 treatments on S180
tumor growth were assessed by measuring tumor volume
with a sliding caliper and body weight. We measured
tumor volume after 96 h post inoculation. The mice were
randomly assigned into four groups, and each group was
treated once every  other day by injection of 0.2 mL of
the solution of 20 mg/kg of 2DG-Har-01, MET-Har-02
and harmine in NS for six times. After treatment, tumor
sizes were measured every other day until average tumor
volume of control group reached approximate 3000 mm3.
At this time, all mice were killed and the tumors were
weighed. Body weight changes were also monitored every
other day. The inhibition ratio (IR) was defined as follows:
Inhibition ratio (%) = ((Wc – Wt)/Wc) × 100%. Wc and

Statistical analysis
All data were reported as the mean SD of n
independent measurements. Statistical analysis was
performed by using Student’s t-test with statistical
significance assigned for P value of < 0.05.

CONCLUSION
Harmine and its reported derivatives present several
drawbacks arising from the relative weak antitumor
8999

Oncotarget

activities and the serious neurotoxicity. To overcome the
limitation, we successfully conjugated two novel harmine
derivatives with different tumor metabolic specific lignads.
The two novel harmine derivatives i.e. 2DG-Har-01 and
MET-Har-02 showed higher antitumor efficiency and lower
systemic and neural toxicity than un-modified harmine in a
broad spectrum of tumor lines. In particular, MET-Har-02
displayed better antitumor activity than that of 2DGHar-01. Our results demonstrated that MET-Har-02 is a
promising candidate for targeted cancer therapy.
