BACKGROUND: Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer have a
higher risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR), even in the setting of early stage, lymph node-negative disease. In this
sequential, retrospective study, the authors evaluated whether adjuvant trastuzumab was associated with reduced
LRR in women with lymph node-negative, HER2-positive disease who received breast-conservation therapy (BCT).
METHODS: By using an institutional database, 197 women were identified who had lymph node-negative, HER2positive breast cancer measuring 5 cm diagnosed between 2002 and 2008 and who received BCT, including
whole-breast irradiation. Two cohorts were compared: 70 women who did not receive trastuzumab (the no-trastuzumab cohort) and 102 women who did receive trastuzumab (the trastuzumab cohort). Kaplan-Meier methods were
used to estimate LRR-free survival. RESULTS: The 2 cohorts were similar in age, tumor size, histology, and hormone
receptor status. Chemotherapy was received by 73% of the no-trastuzumab cohort and by 100% of the trastuzumab
cohort. In both groups, 99% of patients completed radiotherapy with a median dose of 60 Gray. The median
recurrence-free follow-up was 86 months for the no-trastuzumab cohort and 47 months for the trastuzumab
cohort. The 3-year LRR-free survival rate was 90% (95% confidence interval, 83%-97%) for the no-trastuzumab cohort
and 99% (95% confidence interval, 97%-100%) for the trastuzumab cohort. In the no-trastuzumab cohort, LRR
occurred in 7 patients (median time to LRR, 14 months). In the trastuzumab cohort, there was 1 LRR at 14 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Even among women with lower risk breast cancer, the relatively high locoregional failure rates
associated with positive HER2 status could be reduced markedly with adjuvant trastuzumab chemotherapy. Within
3 years, a 10% LRR rate without trastuzumab and a 1% LRR rate with trastuzumab were observed in women with

INTRODUCTION
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression or amplification is a negative prognostic factor for
breast cancer outcomes; however, trastuzumab therapy has significantly improved outcomes for patients with HER2-positive disease. In the adjuvant setting, large randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of trastuzumab, a humanized

monoclonal antibody that binds HER2, in reducing the
risk of recurrence and improving overall survival in
patients with high-risk, HER2-positive disease.1-7 However, patients with lymph node-negative (presumably
low-risk) disease often were excluded from those studies
unless their primary tumors were relatively large. They
represented only 6% of the 2 North American trials and
approximately 30% of the Breast Cancer International
Research Group (BCIRG) 006 and Herceptin Adjuvant
(HERA) trials.1--6 Therefore, consensus guidelines for the
treatment of small, lymph node-negative breast cancers
have been based on extrapolations rather than primary
data and have not clearly recommended trastuzumab.8
Even when conventional factors, such as small
tumor size and negative lymph nodes, suggest a good
prognosis, recent retrospective studies indicate that positive HER2 status remains a negative prognostic factor.9-12
This holds true for locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant
recurrence, and disease-free survival (DFS). Albert et al
demonstrated an 18% LRR rate in patients who had
lymph node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer that
measured <1 cm compared with a 4% LRR rate in
HER2-negative patients (without adjuvant trastuzumab
or other chemotherapy). In the patients who received
breast-conservation therapy, positive HER2 status conferred an LRR hazard ratio of 3.8.12,13
For this subgroup, which largely has been excluded
from randomized trials, it remains unclear whether the
high recurrence rates that have been observed in patients
with HER2-positive disease can be reduced similarly with

adjuvant trastuzumab. Subset analyses from the BCIRG
and HERA trials suggest that trastuzumab has a similar
magnitude of DFS benefit in lymph node-negative cancers compared with the entire cohort.3,14 However, to our
knowledge, no studies have specifically evaluated local
recurrence, which is critical for many lymph nodenegative patients who elect to receive breast-conservation
therapy. At our institution, most patients with early
HER2-positive breast cancer have been offered trastuzumab since 2005, but not before 2005. Given this policy,
we elected to conduct a single-institution, sequential,
retrospective study evaluating LRR in women with lymph
node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer measuring
5 cm who received breast-conservation therapy (BCT)
with or without trastuzumab.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From an institutional breast cancer database, we identified
197 women who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2008
with 5 cm, lymph node-negative, HER2-positive breast
cancer and who underwent wide local excision and received
adjuvant radiation therapy. Patients were included if all
lymph nodes were negative or if there were isolated malignant lymph node cells measuring 0.2 mm (pN0[iþ]).
Patients who had tumors 1 mm (T1 mic) also were
included. Positive HER2 status was defined as an expression level of 3þ by immunohistochemistry or an amplification ratio of 2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
HER2 testing was performed at our institution in 87% of
patients. Of the 22 patients who had testing at an outside
facility, all had an expression level of 3þ by immunohistochemistry, and 5 of these patients had their results
confirmed by repeat testing in another tissue sample.
Patients were excluded if they were diagnosed
between May 2004 and May 2005, because trastuzumab
prescribing practices varied during this period when the
first adjuvant phase 3 trials were reported. Patients also
were excluded if they had received partial breast irradiation or another HER2-targeted agent, such as lapatinib.
Women who had a history of prior invasive breast cancer,
any prior metastatic cancer, any concurrent cancer, or
prior anthracycline or taxane therapy also were excluded.
Therefore, comparisons were made between 2 cohorts:
women diagnosed from 2002 to 2004 who did not receive
trastuzumab and women diagnosed from 2005 to 2008
who received trastuzumab (Fig. 1).
Patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, and
adjuvant therapies were recorded for all eligible patients.

Comparisons between the 2 cohorts were made using the
chi-square test. The primary endpoint of the study was
LRR. Other reported outcomes included distant metastasis, breast cancer-related death, and overall death. Followup for LRR, distant metastasis, and breast cancer-related
death was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date
of an event or the last breast cancer-specific physical examination or mammogram. Follow-up for overall survival
was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of
death or the last direct patient communication. KaplanMeier methods were used to estimate LRR-free survival
(LRRFS), and the log-rank test was used for comparisons
of LRRFS. The 2 cohorts were compared at a follow-up of
3 years to reduce lead-time bias.

RESULTS
Of 197 women who were identified with HER2-positive
T1-T2N0 breast cancer and received BCT, 25 women
were excluded based on the criteria listed above. Because
of a change in prescribing practices in 2005, the remaining women naturally separated into 2 cohorts: 70 women
who did not receive trastuzumab and were diagnosed
from 2002 to 2004 and 102 women who received trastuzumab and were diagnosed from 2005 to 2008 (Fig. 1).

(Table 1). The median tumor size was 1.5 cm in each
group. In total, 80% of patients had tumors that measured <2 cm (T1), and 24% had tumors that measured
<1 cm (T1a,b). This was comparable to a recent retrospective study by Perez indicating that 78% of patients
who received BCT had pT1 tumors.15 The incidence of
lymphovascular invasion in our study was slightly higher
in the trastuzumab cohort, but this difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .28).
Almost all women received some form of adjuvant
systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy) (Table 2). However, 100% of patients in the trastuzumab group received additional chemotherapy, whereas
only 73% of the no-trastuzumab group received chemotherapy (P < .0001). In addition, patients in the no-trastuzumab group were less likely to receive a taxanecontaining regimen (P < .0001). The median duration of
trastuzumab therapy was 50 weeks. One patient in the
trastuzumab cohort developed shortness of breath during
chemotherapy and stopped treatment. The number of
patients receiving hormone therapy was similar in both
cohorts, consistent with the balanced hormone receptor
status.

a
LRR-free survival was statistically different in these cohorts (P ¼ .01;
log-rank test).

Adjuvant radiation to the whole breast was completed in all but 1 patient in each cohort (Table 2). One
patient in the no-trastuzumab cohort developed local
recurrence during the first week of radiation treatment.
The median dose was 60 Gray in each cohort. Radiation
details were available for 91% of patients, and an electron
boost to the tumor bed was standard among these
patients. A hypofractionated radiation regimen was more
common in the trastuzumab cohort, probably because of
mounting evidence supporting the efficacy of hypofractionated radiation, but the difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .20).
Our data revealed significantly improved local control for patients who received trastuzumab compared with
those who did not receive trastuzumab (Table 3). Because
of the difference in diagnosis dates for the 2 cohorts, the
median recurrence-free follow-up was 86 months for the
no-trastuzumab group and 47 months for the trastuzumab group. To address the lead-time bias associated with
longer follow-up in 1 cohort, we specifically compared
events with matched follow-up of 3 years in all patients.
At this time point, follow-up data were available for 95%
of the no-trastuzumab cohort and 74% of the trastuzumab cohort. Among patients in the no-trastuzumab
group, there were 7 local recurrences (10%). The median
time to recurrence was 14 months, and no recurrences
were observed after 3 years. This early recurrence pattern
supported the choice of 3 years as a comparison time
point. In the trastuzumab group, there was 1 local recurrence (1%) at 14 months. We used the Kaplan-Meier
method to estimate LRRFS (Fig. 2). At 3 years, the

had a 90% LRRFS rate (95% confidence interval, 83%-97%),

trastuzumab group had a 99% LRRFS rate (95% CI,
97%-100%). This difference was statistically significant
(P ¼ .01; log-rank test).
To assess the effect of other chemotherapy on
LRRFS, we also used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate LRRFS in the subgroups of patients who received
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (n ¼ 102), chemotherapy alone (n ¼ 51), or neither (n ¼ 19) (Fig. 3). There
were no patients who received trastuzumab alone. At 3
years, these subgroups had LRRFS rates of 99% (95% CI,
97%-100%), 92% (95% CI, 85%-100%), and 84%
(95% CI, 68%-100%), respectively. The difference in
these results was statistically significant (P ¼ .01; log-rank
test), indicating the importance of other chemotherapeutic agents as well as trastuzumab.
The patterns of failure in this study also suggested
that hormone receptor status and hormone therapy were
key factors in local control (Table 4). Of the 8 local failures, only 1 occurred in a patient who received hormone
therapy. Four failures occurred in patients who received
chemotherapy alone (including 3 who received both
anthracyclines and taxanes). Among the patients who
received no systemic therapy at all, 3 of 4 patients developed local failures. All failures occurred in patients who
had T1N0 disease (2 patients with T1 mic tumors and 6
patients with T1c tumors). Only 1 failure involved the

regional lymph nodes in a patient who also had a local
recurrence in the breast.
All of the observed distant metastases and breast cancer-related deaths occurred in patients who did not receive
trastuzumab (Table 3). Two of the patients with LRR
subsequently developed distant metastases and died of
breast cancer. Another patient in the no-trastuzumab
cohort developed an isolated liver recurrence and underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy. At the time of
this report, she remained alive without evidence of disease.
There were 2 additional deaths in the no-trastuzumab
cohort and 1 in the trastuzumab cohort that we believe
were unrelated to breast cancer.

DISCUSSION
Our data demonstrate that the high local failure rates that
have been observed in early, HER2-positive breast cancer
may be lowered with adjuvant trastuzumab chemotherapy. In women with T1-T2N0, HER2-positive breast
cancer who received BCT, we observed a 10% local
recurrence rate within 3 years without trastuzumab and
a 1% rate with trastuzumab. To our knowledge, this is
the first published report demonstrating the benefit of
trastuzumab for local control in the setting of BCT. We
also observed that trastuzumab chemotherapy resulted in
consistent benefits across other endpoints, including
distant metastasis, breast cancer-related death, and overall
death.

1986

Our group recently published a corollary study
investigating the effects of trastuzumab in all patients with
T1N0, HER2-positive breast cancer.16 That study
included women who underwent mastectomy (45%) as
well as those who received BCT (55%). It similarly compared an earlier no-trastuzumab cohort (n ¼ 106) with a
more recent trastuzumab cohort (n ¼ 155). Patients with
T2N0 disease were not included (whereas they comprised
20% of the current study). In that study, again, the
patients who received trastuzumab had an improved
LRRFS rate (98%; P ¼ .014) and an improved distant
recurrence-free survival rate (100%; P ¼ .007) compared
with the no-trastuzumab cohort (LRRFS rate, 92%; distant recurrence-free survival, 95%).16 Those results are
consistent with our current data and suggest that the
impact of trastuzumab is not confined to distant or local
sites of potential relapse.
The high LRR rate in our no-trastuzumab group
(10%) supports the conclusion that patients with early,
lymph node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer
should not be categorized as low risk. Several other studies
also have indicated that positive HER2 status confers a
considerable risk of recurrence in these patients. A Canadian population-based study reported a 66% 10-year
recurrence-free survival rate for patients with lymph
node-negative, HER2-positive disease compared with a
76% recurrence-free survival rate for HER2-negative
patients.17 Studies from Scotland and Finland also
reported decreased DFS and breast cancer-specific survival in patients with T1N0, HER2-positive disease.10,11
Most relevant to our study, data from The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center indicated an 18%
LRR rate at 8 years in patients with HER2-positive,
T1a,bN0 disease compared with a 4% LRR rate in
patients with HER2-negative disease.12,13
Our retrospective data are consistent with mounting
evidence that trastuzumab provides significant benefit for
women with small, lymph node-negative breast cancers.
Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no randomized studies
have been conducted to specifically address the role of
trastuzumab in this group of patients. However, subset
analyses from the randomized BCIRG and HERA trials
offer valuable evidence regarding lymph node-negative
patients. In the HERA trial, 32% of enrolled patients
were lymph node-negative, and these patients had a DFS
benefit with trastuzumab (hazard ratio, 0.59) that was
similar to that for the entire cohort (hazard ratio, 0.64).14
In the BCIRG trial, lymph node-negative patients (29%
of total) had a 7% improvement in DFS with trastuzumab

compared with a 6% improvement in DFS for the entire
cohort. Local recurrence was not evaluated for these
subgroups.
One potential limitation of this study was the confounding effect of chemotherapy on local control, because
all patients in the trastuzumab cohort received additional
chemotherapy compared with only 73% of patients in the
no-trastuzumab cohort. Our subgroup analysis revealed
significant differences in LRRFS among patients who
received trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, chemotherapy
alone, or no chemotherapy, suggesting that both trastuzumab and chemotherapy were important for locoregional
control. However, these subgroup analyses were limited
by a low number of events. Furthermore, the effect of hormone therapy may be even more significant than that of
chemotherapy for patients with estrogen receptor-positive/HER2-positive disease. Indeed, in our current study,
5 of 8 patients who had local failure received chemotherapy, whereas only 1 received hormone therapy.
Another potential source of bias was the difference
in follow-up between the 2 cohorts, because 1 group
was diagnosed in the pre-trastuzumab era (2004 and
earlier), and the other was diagnosed in the post-trastuzumab era (2005 and after). We specifically compared
events with matched follow-up of 3 years to address the
lead-time bias, as noted above. At the 3-year time point,
data were available for 84% of all patients. Further
follow-up is needed to assess for late recurrences in the
trastuzumab cohort. However, the recurrences in the
no-trastuzumab cohort occurred early, as expected in
HER2-positive patients, and no recurrences were
observed after 3 years.12,18
In the United States, 10% of all small, lymph nodenegative breast cancers are HER2-positive, representing
approximately 15,000 women per year.12,19 Our data add
to the evidence that trastuzumab provides significant benefit for these women. In clinical practice, trastuzumab already is being received by most women who have lymph
node-negative, HER2-positive tumors measuring >1 cm,
making it difficult to initiate a randomized trial with a no-

trastuzumab arm.8,20 However, several important questions remain unanswered. First, it is unknown whether
there are low-risk subgroups that truly do not benefit
from trastuzumab. In our study, there was only 1 recurrence among the estrogen receptor-positive/HER2-positive patients who received hormone therapy, suggesting
that this subgroup may have a lower risk. However,
HER2 overexpression is associated with resistance to hormone therapy, and trastuzumab may improve the risk of
late relapse in these patients.21,22 Second, it is unclear
which chemotherapy agents or regimens are optimal in
combination with trastuzumab. All studies that demonstrated a benefit of trastuzumab in early stage breast cancer
used additional adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the
risks of long-term side effects (such as cardiomyopathy for
those who receive anthracyclines), may be unnecessarily
high for patients with small, lymph node-negative disease.
Currently, prospective studies are underway that hopefully will address these questions about the relative benefits and risks of trastuzumab and chemotherapy in this
patient population.
In conclusion, in this retrospective study, we observed
a 10% LRR rate within 3 years without trastuzumab and a
1% LRR rate within 3 years with trastuzumab in patients
who had lymph node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer
who received BCT. Our results demonstrate that the high
local failure rates that have been observed in early, HER2positive breast cancer can be reduced markedly with adjuvant
trastuzumab. Lacking prospective randomized data, our
results may inform patient care decisions.
