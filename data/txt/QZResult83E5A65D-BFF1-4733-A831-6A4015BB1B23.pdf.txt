BACKGROUND: Lonafarnib is an oral selective farnesyltransferase inhibitor, a class of drugs which have shown activity in preclinical
glioma models. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent that is the first-line chemotherapy for glioblastoma. METHODS: The current study combined the cytotoxic agent TMZ with the cytostatic agent lonafarnib for patients with recurrent glioblastoma to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination and its preliminary efficacy. Three dose cohorts of lonafarnib were studied
in the phase 1 component of the trial (100 mg twice daily [bid], 150 mg bid, and 200 bid) with dose-dense schedule of TMZ (150 mg/
m2 daily) administered in an alternating weekly schedule. After establishing the MTD of lonafarnib, a subsequent expansion phase 1b
was undertaken to evaluate efficacy, primarily measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6). RESULTS: Fifteen patients
were enrolled into the phase 1 component and 20 patients into the phase 1b component. The MTD of lonafarnib in combination with
TMZ was 200 mg bid. Among the patients enrolled into the study, 34 were eligible for 6-month progression evaluation and 35
patients were evaluable for time-to-progression analysis. The PFS-6 rate was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5 22%, 56%) and the
median PFS was 3.9 months (95% CI 5 2.5, 8.4). The median disease-specific survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 5 8.9, 22.1). Hematologic toxicities, particularly lymphopenia, were the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events. There were no treatment-related
deaths. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that TMZ can be safely combined with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor and that this
regimen is active, although the current study cannot determine the relative contributions of the 2 agents or the contribution of the

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastomas are rapidly growing primary brain tumors, associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality.
Current management for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma includes surgery followed by external beam radiation and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) therapy.1 Although an international randomized trial confirmed
the efficacy of this regimen compared with radiation alone, recurrent tumor growth is the rule. At present, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment approach for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, especially when recurrence
occurs after exposure to TMZ (which is used as first-line treatment), with most patients have been previously treated with
6 or more cycles of adjuvant therapy or stopped early because of tumor progression.2,3 Prior to the establishment of the
current standard of concurrent chemoradiation for newly diagnosed glioblastoma, several trials evaluated the efficacy of
TMZ in patients with recurrent glioblastoma who were TMZ-naive. In a randomized phase 2 study that compared TMZ
with oral procarbazine, patients receiving TMZ had a 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) of 21%, which was significantly better than those treated with procarbazine (PFS-6 5 8%).4 More recently, 2 studies in which patients treated
with conventional first-line treatment with TMZ using novel dosing strategies were challenged at recurrence with TMZ at
a daily dose of 50 mg/m2 showed clinical benefit with PFS-6 of 17% and 23.9%.5,6 In addition, a study that treated

patients with recurrent glioblastoma using the “week on/
week off” dosing schedule of TMZ at a dose of 150 mg/
m2/day demonstrated clinical benefit with a PFS-6 of
43.8%.7
There have been many studies of signal transduction
modulating agents for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Single-agent studies have demonstrated only modest results, leading to speculation that combination
regimens with either 2 signal transduction modulators or
with conventional cytotoxic agents may be more effective.
Lonafarnib is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), and its
potential activity as an anticancer agent is related to
potential inhibition of the farnesylation of a variety of
intracellular proteins, such as RhoB, RAS, prelamin A,
prelamin B, and CCAX phosphatase, which are involved
in cell proliferation and homeostasis.8 Although FTIs
were developed initially as inhibitors of the Ras pathway,
subsequent studies demonstrated that alternative pathways such as geranyl geranylation are not affected by
FTIs, thereby diminishing the impact of FTIs on Ras.
However, with the broad impact of FTIs, these agents
may affect an upstream component of the proliferation
cascade, leading to a cytostasis.9 In vitro studies using
several established glioblastoma cell lines confirm that
treatment with an FTI significantly inhibits proliferation,
causes cell cycle arrest, and can stimulate apoptosis.10,11
This study combined the cytotoxic agent TMZ with
the cytostatic agent lonafarnib. The rationale for this drug
combination relies on the ability of the FTI to cause cell
cycle arrest.8 Subsequent cessation of the drug should
then lead to an increase in farnesyltransferase activity,
resulting in a rapid increase in tumor cell proliferative
activity and a high percentage of cells in S phase,
potentially maximizing the efficacy of the alkylating effect
of TMZ.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The study enrolled adult patients (18 years), with a
Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score of  60, who
had histologically confirmed supratentorial glioblastoma
or gliosarcoma. Patients were required to have unequivocal radiographic evidence of tumor progression or
recurrence, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging
or computed tomography scan, after radiation therapy.
Additional eligibility criteria included adequate bone
marrow, renal, and liver function. Patients might have
had as many as 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for recurrent or progressive tumor but could not have had prior
2748

treatment with an FTI (lonafarnib or tipifarnib). Patients
in phase 1b expansion were required to have a treatment
history of a minimum of 2 cycles of adjuvant TMZ. An
imaging study, to serve as baseline, had to be performed
within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dose
that has been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days.
Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of
prior therapy. Patients who had undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor were eligible even if
they did not have radiologically measurable disease, provided they had completely recovered from surgery.
Patients were not permitted to use enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) because of well-established
drug-drug interactions that lead to alterations in the pharmacokinetics of lonafarnib. Patients changing from
EIAEDs to non-EIAEDs had to be off EIAEDs for at least
72 hours prior to the initiation of treatment. Patients with
a history of any other cancer (except nonmelanoma skin
cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) were ineligible
unless in complete remission and off of all therapy for that
disease for a minimum of 3 years. Subjects deemed to
have progressed immediately after completing concurrent
TMZ and radiation therapy were not considered for entry
in order to reduce possibility of “pseudo-progression.” All
patients were required to provide informed consent, and
the institutional review board approved the study.
Treatment Plan and Endpoints

TMZ at a dose of 150 mg/m2/day was administered
orally, after fasting for 1 hour, once a day for 7 consecutive
days (days 1 through 7 and days 15 through 21) of each
28-day course of therapy. Courses were repeated every 28
days. Patients might be premedicated with prochlorperazine (10 mg) orally 30 to 60 minutes before temozolamide
dosing and repeated every 4 to 6 hours as necessary to prevent nausea and vomiting. Lonafarnib was given orally,
with water, in the morning and in the evening for 7 consecutive days (days 8 through 14 and days 22 through 28)
1 hour before or after morning and evening meals.
Courses were repeated every 28 days.
Phase 1 Treatment Plan

The primary endpoint of the phase 1 study was to define
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lonafarnib, keeping the dose and schedule of TMZ unchanged. The dose
of lonafarnib was escalated according to a standard 3 1 3
design, starting at dose level 0 with 100 mg bid. Further
prespecified dose escalations were 150 mg bid and 200
mg bid for 7 consecutive days. The MTD was defined as
the dose at which no more than 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 patients
Cancer

Phase 1/1b Lonafarnib and Temozolomide in Glioblastoma/Yust-Katz et al

experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) with the next
higher dose having at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
encountering DLT. The definitions of DLTs were based
on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(version 3) and included the following events: grade 4
thrombocytopenia, grade 4 anemia and/or grade 4 neutropenia or any nonhematologic grade 3 toxicity, excluding alopecia but including grade 3 vomiting or diarrhea
uncontrolled by supportive therapy.
Phase 1b Treatment Plan

The primary endpoint of the phase 1b component was to
further elucidate the tolerability of an alternating 7-day
on, 7-day off combination of TMZ and lonafarnib in
patients who had failed prior TMZ treatment, defined as
having had tumor progression/recurrence while under or
having recently completed treatment with adjuvant
TMZ.
Secondary endpoints included treatment response as
measured by overall PFS, the 6-month PFS rate, objective
response, and overall survival from study entry. Patients
enrolled on the phase 1b component of this trial were
treated at the established MTD from the phase 1 study.
Therefore, the dose of TMZ was 150 mg/m2 orally
administered on a 7-day on, 7-day off schedule and alternating with lonafarnib orally administered at 200 mg
twice a day using a 7-day on, 7-day off schedule that did
not overlap with TMZ administration. Significant (grade
3 or 4) hematologic and nonhematologic treatmentrelated toxicities resulted in either treatment cessation or
treatment toxicity-specific dose reductions.
Patient Evaluation During the Study

Baseline evaluation included a physical examination with
a neurological evaluation, complete blood counts, blood
chemistries including renal and hepatic function, a serum
pregnancy test (where appropriate) and tumor imaging
with either magnetic resonance (preferred) or computed
tomography. Patients had blood counts and blood chemistries measured on day 22 (63 days) of each course
(cycle duration of 28 days) and prior to each new course; a
repeat tumor imaging study was performed prior to the
initiation of every odd course or as clinically indicated.
Neurologic examinations were performed within 14 days
prior to the initiation of every odd course, or at any time
that was clinically indicated. Patients were evaluated for
adverse events weekly during their first cycle of therapy
for the determination of the MTD. Adverse events for
subsequent cycles were used for dose modifications but
did not affect the determination of the MTD. Clinical

response was assessed using neurological examination and
KPS. Radiological response was assessed using McDonald
criteria.12 Toxicities were recorded and graded according
to the CTCAE, version 3.0.
Statistical Analyses
Phase 1

The MTD of the combination of lonafarnib and TMZ
was defined as the dose at which 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 patients
experience DLT with the next higher dose having at least
2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients encountering DLT. Three additional patients were tested at the putative MTD to confirm the safety of this dose level.
Phase 1b

Efficacy analyses combined outcomes from patients enrolled on both the phase 1 and phase 1b components of
the clinical trial. For overall efficacy combining the phase
1 with phase 1b components, a well-established historical
data set was used to define efficacy where the proportion
of patients remaining alive and free from progression at 6
months was 15% (95% confidence interval [CI] ranged
from 10% to 19%).11 We therefore set p0 5 15% and
p1 5 30% using a doubling of the historical 6-month
PFS rate. Based on these design parameters, a 2-stage
design would require that at least 4 of the initial 15
patients are without progression at 6 months. If the study
continued accrual to a total of 34 patients, with 26 treated
at the MTD, the combination regimen in phase 2 testing
will be considered as effective if more than 7 of 34 patients
have not progressed at 6 months. This provides a 1-tailed
alpha 5 0.11 with a power of 79% for the 30% alternative. The Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to estimate PFS and survival.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled on both
the phase 1 and phase 1b components of the study are
provided in Table 1.
Phase 1

A total of 15 patients were accrued to the phase 1 component between December 22, 2004, and July 5, 2005 (6
patients to the first dose level 0, 3 patients to dose level 1,
6 patients to dose level 2). There were no treatmentrelated dose-limiting toxicities. However, 1 of the first 3
patients at dose level 1 died on day 29 of an unrelated cardiac event. An additional 3 patients were accrued to this
dose level to confirm safety of the dose. Further dose escalation ensued without additional cardiac events. As
2749

planned, 3 additional patients were enrolled onto the
third dose level (dose 2) to confirm treatment tolerability.
Phase 1b

Twenty-one patients were accrued and treated on the
phase 1b expansion component between July 27, 2005,
and February 9, 2007. All patients had received prior
TMZ and were considered to have failed TMZ treatment.
Importantly, only 8 patients on our study had imaging
worsening within the 3 months following completion of

All patients were treated with alternating 7-day on,
7-day off combination of TMZ and lonafarnib (200 mg

evaluate overall treatment efficacy yields 34 evaluable
patients for evaluation progression at 6 months, because 2
patients were excluded (1 with cardiac death at day 29, 1

no prior TMZ exposure, 22 patients had tumor progression while receiving adjuvant TMZ before completion of
6 cycles of adjuvant TMZ, 8 patients had tumor progression while receiving extended adjuvant TMZ beyond the
standard 6 cycles but before completion of adjuvant treatment, and 2 patients had progression after completion of

Treatment Results

The average number of treatment cycles on the study was
7.8 (median 5 3, range 5 1-69). For all patients, the
Kaplan-Meier estimated median disease-specific survival
from study entry was 13.7 months (95% CI 5 8.9, 22.1)
(Fig. 1) and median progression-free survival was 3.9
months (95% CI 5 2.5, 8.4) (Fig. 2). The 6-month PFS
rate was approximately 38%. One patient remains progression-free at 3.5 years, this patient underwent partial
tumor resection prior to enrollment that confirmed recurrent tumor. The residual enhancing tumor was 2.3 cm2

and resolved with treatment to achieve a radiographic
complete response.
For the 26 patients who were treated at the MTD,
median disease-specific survival was 14.9 months (95%
CI 5 8.9, 23.3) and 6-month PFS was 42.3% (95%
CI 5 27%, 66%) (Fig. 2).
Six patients (17.6%) demonstrated a partial tumor
response as defined by a reduction in the size of
the enhancing lesion by > 50% using cross-sectional
area, while on stable or decreasing corticosteroid dose
(McDonald criteria) and 2 patients (5.9%) achieved a
radiographic complete response. In addition, 16 (47.1%)
patients had stable disease. The remaining 10 (29.4%)
patients demonstrated progressive disease.
Factors that were associated with a better prognosis
included patient age (<60) for overall survival (P 5 .03).
There was a trend toward longer survival in the group
of patients who had early (< 6 cycles of adjuvant TMZ)
progression compared with the other groups; however,
this difference was not statistically significant. High KPS
had a nonsignificant trend toward improved outcome.
Other factors such as sex and tumor resection before
initiating treatment did not impact prognosis.

DISCUSSION
Single-agent administration of signal transduction modulators has not proven to be effective in recurrent glioblastoma, even with agents targeting pathways that are
thought to be important in glioma tumor biology.13
Single-agent use of FTIs in malignant gliomas has not
demonstrated significant efficacy. A phase 2 trial of
tipifarnib, an oral FTI, revealed a 6-month PFS rate of
12%.14 However, combination regimens with cytotoxic
chemotherapy may demonstrate improved efficacy due to
additive or synergistic effects. The current study began as
a dose-finding phase 1 trial, but was expanded after tumor
responses were seen in patients who had previously failed
initial treatment with temozolomide.
The current study, which combined lonafarnib with
TMZ, demonstrated a 6-month PFS rate of 38% in all
treatment doses and 6-month PFS of 42% in patients
treated with the MTD. All but 2 patients had prior treatment with TMZ. These promising results do suggest that
there is either synergy between the agents in this combination or that the novel schedule of treatment administration contributed to the efficacy. The theoretical basis of
the alternating-week treatment is based on laboratory
studies suggesting that cytostatic agents including the
FTIs act to halt cell cycle activity, thereby leading to a
marked increase in the mitotic cascade when the drug is
stopped.15 This would potentially increase the efficacy of
TMZ as the tumor cells re-enter the cell cycle after
cessation of administration of the cytostatic agent.
Conversely, concurrent or overlapping administration of
lonafarnib with TMZ may lessen treatment efficacy.
Therefore, it is not surprising that a recently published
phase 1 study which evaluated combination of lonafarnib
with TMZ administered on the standard 5-day dosing
schedule showed minimal efficacy.16 Moreover, the aim
of that phase 1 study was dose finding, and therefore,
most patients did not receive treatment at the MTD.
A published preclinical study supports our findings
by reporting that with in vitro brain tumor models, lonafarnib alone had limited tumor cell cytotoxicity, although
it did demonstrate significant inhibition in tumor cell
proliferation. In orthotropic in vivo glioblastoma murine
models, combining radiation, TMZ, and lonafarnib demonstrated significant antitumor activity, with the majority
of animals demonstrating a decrease in tumor volume.17
The issue of pseudoprogression is germane in all
recurrent trials in glioblastoma. However, as described
above, only 8 patients on our study had imaging worsening within the 3 months following completion of chemoradiation (the “pseudoprogression window”). Five of
2752

these had pathologically proven progression from either a
biopsy or tumor resection; therefore, only 3 patients who
progressed within 3 months from radiation were diagnosed with progression according to imaging studies only.
Therefore, we do not think the efficacy seen with this regimen is due to unrecognized “pseudoprogression.”18
Similar to the recent report from the RESCUE study
that used continuous daily dosing of TMZ (50 mg/m2/
day) in patients with recurrent malignant glioma, the
highest response was in the patient groups who had
received fewer than 6 cycles of prior TMZ and were
stopped because of concerns for tumor progression.7
In our study, this subgroup had a 6-month PFS of 48%,
comparing favorably to the RESCUE study, where the
6-month PFS in this subgroup was 27%. However, even
in the other patients on our study who were less likely to
have pseudoprogression, the 6-month PFS was 27%,
strongly supporting that the treatment combination had
efficacy even in truly TMZ-refractory disease.
In the RESCUE study, the group of patients who
experienced progression after a treatment-free interval
appeared to derive the most benefit from the therapy.7 In
our study, the group of patients who were rechallenged after treatment-free interval of greater than 2 months
included only 2 patients, and therefore no conclusions
could be drawn regarding this group of patients.
Overall, the treatment was well tolerated, and most
of the grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities were from
lymphopenia. This lymphopenia was not associated with
opportunistic infections, but this should mandate monitoring blood counts carefully in patients treated with this
combination.
There are limitations in interpreting the efficacy
results of this study, because it was designed as a phase 1
dose-finding study, and although included as a secondary
endpoint, it was the unanticipated responses in the phase
1 component that led to the phase 1b expansion. Furthermore, the study did not compare the combination regimen with dose-dense temozolomide alone, limiting the
ability to attribute efficacy to the combination. Although
these results look promising, the limited scope of efficacy
of lonafarnib in other cancers such as single-agent treatment in colon cancer and head and neck cancer, and in
combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for ovarian
cancer, precluded additional investigation.19-21 However,
a randomized study comparing the cytotoxic agent alone
with the combination regimen would help elucidate
the role of the combination regimen or the potential
impact of enrollment of patients with unsuspected
pseudoprogression.
