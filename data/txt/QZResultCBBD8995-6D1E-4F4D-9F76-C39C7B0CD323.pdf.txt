Abstract
AS1411 is a quadruplex-forming oligonucleotide aptamer
that targets nucleolin. It is currently in clinical trials as a
treatment for various cancers. We have proposed that AS1411
inhibits cancer cell proliferation by affecting the activities of
certain nucleolin-containing complexes. Here, we report that
protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an enzyme that
catalyzes the formation of symmetrical dimethylarginine
(sDMA), is a nucleolin-associated protein whose localization
and activity are altered by AS1411. Levels of PRMT5 were
found to be decreased in the nucleus of AS1411-treated DU145
human prostate cancer cells, but increased in the cytoplasm.
These changes were dependent on nucleolin and were not
observed in cells pretreated with nucleolin-specific small
interfering RNA. Treatment with AS1411 altered levels of
PRMT5 activity (assessed by sDMA levels) in accord with
changes in its localization. In addition, our data indicate that
nucleolin itself is a substrate for PRMT5 and that distribution
of sDMA-modified nucleolin is altered by AS1411. Because
histone arginine methylation by PRMT5 causes transcriptional
repression, we also examined expression of selected PRMT5
target genes in AS1411-treated cells. For some genes, including
cyclin E2 and tumor suppressor ST7, a significant up-regulation
was noted, which corresponded with decreased PRMT5 association with the gene promoter. We conclude that nucleolin is a
novel binding partner and substrate for PRMT5, and that
AS1411 causes relocalization of the nucleolin-PRMT5 complex
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Consequently, the nuclear
activity of PRMT5 is decreased, leading to derepression of
some PRMT5 target genes, which may contribute to the
biological effects of AS1411. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10491–500]

Introduction
Oligonucleotide aptamers are short sequences of DNA or RNA
(or modified versions thereof) that can bind to specific proteins via
recognition of their three-dimensional structure. Thus, they are
mechanistically similar to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies,
but may have certain advantages over antibodies, such as stability,
ease of manufacture, and nonimmunogenicity (1). Aptameric
oligonucleotides frequently contain secondary structure motifs,
such as hairpins or G-quartets, and are usually discovered by
in vitro evolution techniques (1), although some have been
discovered by chance (2, 3).

We have previously reported on phosphodiester G-rich oligonucleotides, termed GROs, which function as nucleolin-binding
aptamers (3–7). These have strong growth-inhibitory activity
against various types of cancer cells, but have minimal effects on
nonmalignant cells (4, 7). Active GROs can form stable Gquadruplex structures that are resistant to degradation by heat
or exonucleases (5, 6). One of the GROs, now known as AS1411
( formerly AGRO100 or GRO26B-OH), is the first aptamer to be
tested in clinical trials as a cancer therapeutic. The results of phase
I clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer were presented
recently and indicate that AS1411 was well tolerated with no
reports of any serious adverse events (8, 9). Furthermore, there was
evidence of promising clinical activity, including objective
responses in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (8, 9).
Nucleolin (the molecular target of AS1411) is a remarkably
multifunctional protein that can be present in the nucleoli,
nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane of cells (reviewed
in refs. 10–12). Levels of nucleolin are known to correlate with the
rate of cellular proliferation, being elevated in rapidly dividing cells,
such as malignant cells, but barely detectable in quiescent cells
(13, 14). Some of the most studied aspects of nucleolin biology are
its roles in ribosome biogenesis, which include the control of
rDNA transcription, preribosome packaging, and organization of
nucleolar chromatin. Another major role is as a shuttle protein
that transports viral and cellular proteins between the cytoplasm
and nucleus/nucleolus of the cell. Nucleolin has also been
implicated, directly or indirectly, in many other functions including
apoptosis, nuclear matrix structure, DNA replication, mRNA
stability, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, telomere
maintenance, cytokinesis, as a nucleic acid helicase, and as a
G-quadruplex binding protein (see refs. 3, 4, 7, 10–12, 15 and
references therein). In addition, there are numerous reports
describing the presence of nucleolin on the cell surface and its
function as a receptor for a variety of ligands (16–22). The
significance of nucleolin in cancer biology is becoming increasingly
apparent and several recent studies have indicated a direct role in
malignant transformation (22–26).
Although the primary target of AS1411 has been identified, the
precise mechanism of its antiproliferative activity is not yet fully
understood. Like many other nucleolin-binding ligands, AS1411
binds to cell surface nucleolin and is internalized by cancer cells.4
We propose that, once inside the cell, binding of AS1411 modulates
the interactions between nucleolin and its binding partners,
leading to pleiotropic biological effects. Our current research aims
to identify nucleolin-containing complexes that are altered in
AS1411-treated prostate cancer cells and to investigate the

biological consequences of these changes. In this report, we
describe our identification of protein arginine methyltransferase 5
(PRMT5) as a novel binding partner for nucleolin and the effects of
AS1411 on the subcellular localization and activity of PRMT5.

Materials and Methods
Materials. The human prostate cancer cell line DU145 was obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The oligodeoxynucleotides used
were AS1411, 5¶-d(GGTGGTGGTGGTTGTGGTGGTGGTGG)-3¶, and an inactive control oligonucleotide, 5¶-d(CCTCCTCCTCCTTCTCCTCCTCCTCC)-3¶.
Both had a phosphodiester backbone and were purchased in the desalted
form from Integrated DNA Technologies. Anti-FLAG peptide antibody (M2),
M2-conjugated agarose beads, FLAG peptide, nonionic detergent IGEPAL
CA-630, anti–h-actin, and anti-PRMT5 monoclonal antibodies were from
Sigma-Aldrich. Anti–asymmetrical dimethylated arginine (aDMA; ASYM24)
and anti–symmetrical dimethylarginine (sDMA; SYM10) polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. MagnaBind goat antimouse IgG beads and anti-rabbit IgG beads were from Pierce. Anti-nucleolin
monoclonal antibody (MS-3) and anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies linked
to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit was from Qiagen. Amylose-linked
magnetic beads were from New England Biolabs.
Plasmid construction. To construct FLAG-tagged nucleolin expression
plasmid (pFLAG-nucleolin), the NruI-XhoI fragment (encoding amino acids
7–707) of pBS-nucleolin (IMAGE 591D39, ATCC) was subcloned into the
EcoRV-XhoI fragment of a pCMV2-FLAG vector (Sigma-Aldrich). The
reading frame and sequence of the resulting pFLAG-nucleolin plasmid were
confirmed by automated sequencing.
Cell culture, transient transfection, and treatment with oligonucleotides. DU145 cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 100 units/mL of
penicillin and streptomycin, and cultured at 37jC with 5% CO2. For
transient transfection, cells (70% confluent in T75 flasks) were transfected
with 10 Ag of plasmid using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen, Inc.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For treatment with oligonucleotides, a stock solution (typically 1,000 Amol/L) in water was
added directly to the cell culture medium to give the desired final
concentration. Except where indicated, the final concentration of oligonucleotide was 10 Amol/L and cells were treated for 24 h before preparation of
cell extracts.
Immunofluorescence. After 24 h of transfection, cells were plated in
eight-well culture slides (Biocoat, Becton Dickinson). After a further 24 h,
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washing
with PBSTX (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100), cells were blocked with 5% goat
serum in PBSTX for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary
antibody (10 Ag/mL of anti-FLAG or 5 Ag/mL of anti-nucleolin) overnight
at 4jC, washed, and then incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse for
1 h at room temperature. Fluorescent images were visualized with a
Bionanoscope (Nikon).
Preparation of protein extracts from DU145 cells. Nuclear and
cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (15). Fractionation was confirmed by Western blotting for cytoplasmic marker
(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and nuclear marker ( fibrillarin). Extracts were either used immediately or stored at 80jC. For
whole-cell lysates, cells were mixed with lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), with 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5%
IGEPAL CA630] and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics), incubated for 30 min on a shaker at 4jC, and the supernatant was
collected after centrifugation.
Immunoprecipitation assays. For capture of FLAG-tagged protein,
extracts from transiently transfected cells were incubated with 40 AL of
washed anti-FLAG beads for 4 h at 4jC. The protein-bound agarose beads
were collected and washed five times with buffer. Proteins were eluted with
20 AL of 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl and 150 mmol/L NaCl containing 150 Ag/mL
of 3 FLAG peptide. For immunoprecipitations of endogenous proteins,

200 Ag of extracts from nontransfected DU145 cells were incubated with
2 Ag of specific antibody in 500 AL of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)
buffer [PBS, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mol/L NaCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA,
1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L sodium fluoride,
10 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 Amol/L aprotinin, 100 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate] for 1 h at 4jC. MagnaBind goat anti-mouse IgG or
goat anti-rabbit IgG beads (250 AL) were added and incubated overnight at
4jC. Beads were captured, washed four times with RIPA buffer, then
resuspended in 1 SDS-loading buffer [100 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8),
200 mmol/L DTT, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol] and placed
at 95jC for 5 min. Beads were captured and the supernatant containing
eluted proteins was removed.
Electrophoresis and silver staining. Samples were incubated in 1
SDS-loading buffer at 95jC for 5 min, and separated on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. The silver staining was done as follows: The gel was fixed in
50% methanol, 5% acetic acid, for 30 min with rotation, then sensitized with
0.02% sodium thiosulfate for 2 min. After washing thrice for 5 min with
distilled water, the gel was incubated in 0.1% silver nitrate solution for 30 to
60 min at 4jC. After washing twice for 1 min with distilled water, the gel
was developed in 0.04% formalin, 2% sodium carbonate until the desired
intensity of staining was achieved. Development was terminated with 1%
acetic acid solution.
Protein identification by proteomic analysis by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In-gel
trypsin digestion was carried out as described (27) with modification as
follows: Protein bands were excised and incubated in 50 mmol/L
NH4HCO3/50% acetonitrile at room temperature for 15 min. The gel pieces
were allowed to swell by incubating with 20 mmol/L DTT in 0.1 mol/L
NH4HCO3 for 45 min at 56jC. After removing this DTT solution, the gel was
incubated in 55 mmol/L iodoacetamide in 0.1 mol/L NH4HCO3 for 30 min
in the dark. The gel was rinsed with 50 mmol/L NH4HCO3 and incubated in
50 mmol/L NH4HCO3/50% acetonitrile to shrink. After drying in a speedvac,
an aliquot of 25 Ag/mL sequencing-grade trypsin in 50 mmol/L NH4HCO3
was added. After 45-min incubation on ice, the supernatant was discarded
and replaced with 20 AL of 50 mmol/L NH4HCO3. Digestion was done at
37jC overnight and fragmented peptides were extracted from the gel with
5% formic acid/50% acetonitrile. To improve the ionization efficiency of
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), ZipTipC18 (Millipore) was used to purify peptides
before MS analysis, according to the manufacturer’s manual. The peptides
were eluted with 2 AL of 5 mg/mL a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50%
acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied directly onto the target
and allowed to air dry. Peptide mass fingerprints were obtained using a
TOF-Spec 2E MALDI-TOF mass spectrophotometer (Waters). The Mascot
program (Matrix Science)5 was used to interpret MS spectra of protein
digests.
Capture of complexes using purified recombinant maltose binding
protein–nucleolin fusion proteins. Plasmids for the expression of maltose
binding protein (MBP) fused to nucleolin fragments were a gift from
Dr. Nancy Maizels (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Recombinant
proteins were produced by overexpression in Escherichia coli and purified
as described previously (28). Purified MBP-tagged nucleolin fragments
(50 pmol) were incubated with 10 Ag of whole-cell lysate and 100 AL of
amylose-linked magnetic beads in 500 AL of column buffer [20 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 mol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] for 1 h at 4jC. The beads were precipitated and
washed thrice with column buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with
50 AL of SDS loading buffer.
Small interfering RNA transfection. One day before transfection,
DU145 cells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 2.0  105 per well
in 1.5 mL of DMEM without antibiotics. For each transfection, 200 pmol of
nucleolin Stealth RNAi Select (Invitrogen) or control Stealth RNAi Negative
Control (Invitrogen) were diluted in 200 AL of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). In a

separate tube, 10 AL of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) were diluted in
200 AL Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The
diluted oligomer and diluted LipofectAMINE 2000 were mixed gently and
incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The oligomer-LipofectAMINE
2000 complexes were then added to each well containing cells and
medium. Cells were incubated at 37jC in the presence of the transfection
solution for 24 h, then the medium was replaced with DMEM containing
10% FCS.
Western blot analysis. Samples were separated on 8% gels and
electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After
blocking for 1 h in 5% nonfat dried milk in PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in
PBS), the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature or
overnight at 4jC with primary antibody. After three washes in PBST,
the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
goat anti-mouse antibody for 45 min at room temperature, washed
thrice in PBST, and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE
Healthcare).
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and cell cycle analysis. Total RNA was
prepared from untreated and treated DU145 cells using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The yield and
quality of RNA was evaluated by measuring its absorbance at A 260/A 280
using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). The cDNA
was prepared with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).
According to the manufacturer’s manual, a total of 1 Ag of each sample was
included in a 20 AL reaction containing 2 AL of 7 gDNA Wipeout Buffer,
4 AL of 5  Quantiscript RT Buffer, 1 AL of RT Primer Mix, and 1 AL of
Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase. One microliter of this mixture was used
as template for PCR amplification. Thirty-five PCR cycles were done as
follows: 15 s denaturation at 94jC, 15 s annealing at 60jC, and 30 s
extension at 72jC. Thermal cycling was done on a DNA Engine Opticon
System (MJ Research). Each sample was run in triplicate based on which
average copy numbers were calculated. Copy numbers were normalized to
h-actin control amplification. Specific primer pairs were used to amplify the
following genes: NM23 (+30 to +250, BC000293), ST7 (+548 to +653,
BC030954), Cyclin E2 (+135 to +243, BC020729), and b-actin (+140 to +585).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were done using the
EpiQuick ChIP kit (Epigentek, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The promoter sequences amplified have been previously
described and were as follows: ST7 205 to +199 (29) and cyclin E2 312 to
+129 (30). The PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and stained
with ethidium bromide for visualization. Analysis of cell cycle distribution
was carried out by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide–stained
cells, exactly as previously described (4).
Densitometry and statistical analysis. In some experiments, densitometry was used to measure band intensities by scanning autoradiographic films and using UN-SCAN-IT gel software (Silk Scientific
Corporation). Band intensities were normalized as indicated in the figure
legends and the results were expressed as mean and SE from at least three
separate experiments, where indicated. The statistical comparisons between
AS1411-treated and control groups were carried out using Student’s t test,
and differences are indicated as * (P < 0.05) or ** (P < 0.01).

Results
Identification of PRMT5 as a nucleolin-associated protein.
We used the pFLAG-nucleolin construct to express FLAG-tagged
nucleolin in DU145 prostate cancer cells and confirmed that the
epitope-tagged protein had similar distribution to endogenous
nucleolin (see Fig. 1A). To isolate nucleolin-associated proteins,
we transiently transfected DU145 cells with pFLAG-nucleolin for
72 h, then prepared protein extracts and carried out immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody. The captured proteins
were separated by electrophoresis and visualized by silver
staining, followed by tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF-MS
analysis. Using this technique, we were able to identify several

www.aacrjournals.org

bands representing candidate nucleolin-interacting proteins.6
Among these proteins, we focused on validating one particular
band whose interaction with nucleolin was altered by AS1411.
As shown in Fig. 1B (arrow), this protein was specifically
coprecipitated by FLAG-nucleolin and was decreased in immunoprecipitated nuclear extracts from cells treated with AS1411 but
unchanged in extracts from cells treated with a control oligonucleotide. This protein was subsequently identified as PRMT5 by
mass peptide fingerprinting of trypsin digests using MALDI-TOFMS (Fig. 1C).
Endogenous nucleolin interacts with PRMT5 and AS1411
alters the localization of nucleolin-associated PRMT5. To
evaluate the interaction of endogenous nucleolin with PRMT5 in
DU145 cells, we did immunoprecipitation using antinucleolin
antibody and probed with anti-PRMT5 antibody. PRMT5 complexes
have been reported in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell (31) and, in this case, PRMT5 was coprecipitated
with endogenous nucleolin using either nuclear or cytoplasmic
extracts from wild-type DU145 cells (Fig. 1D). The results also clearly
showed that nucleolin-associated PRMT5 was decreased in the
nucleus of AS1411-treated cells and was increased in the cytoplasm
of AS1411-treated cells, compared with untreated cells. The control
oligonucleotide had no effect on the localization of nucleolinassociated PRMT5 and there was no apparent change in the levels of
nucleolin in extracts from AS1411-treated cells. Neither nucleolin
nor PRMT5 could be identified in mock immunoprecipitates using
normal mouse IgG or in nucleolin immunoprecipitates without
added protein extracts, thus confirming the specificity of the
interaction. These finding were highly reproducible and statistically
significant (Fig. 1D, bottom).
AS1411 induces nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution of
PRMT5 via a nucleolin-mediated mechanism. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we analyzed levels of PRMT5 in
nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from AS1411-treated cells by
Western blotting. Figure 2A shows that there is a time-dependent
decrease in levels of nuclear PRMT5, which is matched closely by a
concomitant increase in levels of cytoplasmic PRMT5. The
redistribution of PRMT5 was apparent by 4 h after addition of
AS1411 and was maximal at 24 h. There was very little change in
PRMT5 distribution in cells incubated with the control oligonucleotide. Using similar techniques, we determined that the
redistribution of PRMT5 also depends on the dose of AS1411 (see
Fig. 2B). The degree of PRMT5 relocalization seen in these Western
blots analyzing total PRMT5 was comparable with that seen in the
previous experiments, which examined nucleolin-associated
PRMT5 (compare Fig. 1D with the 24 h time point in Fig. 2A),
suggesting that it is the nucleolin-associated PRMT5 that is altered
by AS1411. To test our hypothesis that the AS1411-induced
relocalization of PRMT5 is mediated by nucleolin, we next
examined cells that had been transfected with a small interfering
RNA (siRNA) that specifically depletes nucleolin (Fig. 2C). In these
cells, the AS1411-induced changes in PRMT5 were almost
completely abrogated, whereas the effect of AS1411 on PRMT5
persisted in cells treated with a control siRNA.
AS1411 changes the distribution of sDMA—a modification
that is catalyzed by PRMT5. Protein arginine methyltransferases
are classified as type II enzymes, which catalyze the symmetrical

dimethylation of target arginines, or type I arginine methyltransferases, which catalyze asymmetrical dimethylation (31–36).
PRMT5 is thought to be the major type II enzyme that is
responsible for sDMA modifications in most cell types. Therefore,
to investigate the effect of AS1411 on the activity of PRMT5, we
analyzed levels of sDMA in extracts from AS1411-treated and
control-treated DU145 cells by Western blotting using an antibody
named SYM10, which specifically recognizes sDMA (36). As a

control for specificity, we also used an antibody named ASYM24,
which recognizes aDMA-containing proteins (36). Extracts from
the nucleus and cytoplasm of AS1411-treated, control-treated, and
untreated DU145 cells were analyzed by Western blotting using
either SYM10 or ASYM24 and the recognition patterns of the
two antibodies were found to be quite distinct, confirming their
specificity (see Fig. 3A). Moreover, the results shown in Fig. 3A
indicate that treatment with AS1411 results in a specific decrease

AS1411 Alters Distribution of PRMT5-Nucleolin Complex

in the intensity of bands recognized by SYM10 in the nuclear
extracts, with a corresponding increase in the intensity of SYM10immunoreactive bands in the cytoplasmic extracts. In contrast,
there were no changes in the bands detected by ASYM24 in extracts
from AS1411-treated cells. Because the sDMA modifications
recognized by SYM10 are presumably an indicator of PRMT5
activity, these data are consistent with the observed nuclear-tocytoplasmic redistribution of the enzyme.
The nucleolin complex contains sDMA modifications and is
a likely substrate for PRMT5. Because nucleolin is associated
with PRMT5 and contains an arginine-rich region (the ‘‘RGG

domain’’), which is a common target for PRMTs (31–36), we
wondered if nucleolin itself could be a substrate for PRMT5. To test
this idea, we immunoprecipitated with the SYM10 antibody and
then Western blotted using antinucleolin antibody. As indicated in
Fig. 3B, the anti-sDMA antibody was able to specifically precipitate
nucleolin. Furthermore, there was a nuclear-to-cytoplasmic shift in
levels of sDMA-precipitated nucleolin in AS1411-treated cells,
similar to that seen for PRMT5. This was in contrast to the levels of
total nucleolin, for which there was no obvious change (see the
nucleolin blot in Fig. 1D), suggesting that sDMA-modified nucleolin
may represent only a small proportion of the total nucleolin pool.

distribution of PRMT5 in a time-dependent,
dose-dependent, and nucleolin-dependent
manner. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts

Figure 3. AS1411 alters the distribution of sDMA-modified proteins, including sDMA-nucleolin. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from DU145 cells
that were untreated ( ) or had been treated with either AS1411 (1411 ) or control oligonucleotide (CRO ). A, extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for sDMA or
aDMA, as indicated. The intensities of representative bands, which were normalized to the loading control (h-actin) and expressed relative to untreated cells, are shown
below each blot. B, sDMA-modified proteins were captured from extracts by immunoprecipitation using anti-sDMA antibody and precipitated proteins were then Western

sDMA antibody was quantified by densitometry of Western blots. Levels were expressed relative to the untreated sDMA immunoprecipitate in each blot. Columns, mean
of three independent experiments; bars, SE. C, the proportion of total PRMT5 that is associated with nucleolin was estimated by comparing levels of PRMT5 and
nucleolin in extracts before and after immunoprecipitation with nucleolin antibody. The blots show 10 Ag of nuclear or cytoplasmic extract compared with the total
immunoprecipitate obtained from 50 Ag of the same extract using a nucleolin antibody (NCL ) or nonspecific control (IgG ). The fraction of protein precipitated was
calculated by dividing the intensity of the relevant immunoprecipitated band by five times the intensity of the corresponding extract band. The proportion of PRMT5
associated with nucleolin is the fraction of coprecipitated PRMT5 divided by the fraction of precipitated nucleolin. D, a similar experiment was done to estimate
the percentage of nucleolin that is sDMA-modified.

Therefore, we postulated that only a small fraction of the total
nucleolin is associated with PRMT5, whereas most of the PRMT5
exists in a complex with nucleolin. This would explain why a large
proportion of the total PRMT5 is translocated in AS1411-treated
cells by 24 h (Fig. 2A), whereas levels of total nucleolin are virtually
unchanged by AS1411 (Fig. 1D). To test this theory, we estimated
the fraction of total nucleolin that was associated with PRMT5, and
vice versa, by analyzing the amount of protein immunoprecipitated
compared with the total protein, also taking into account the
efficiency of the immunoprecipitation. Our results (Fig. 3C)
indicate that a large proportion (>78%) of the total PRMT5
coprecipitates with nucleolin. We were not able to directly assess
PRMT5-associated nucleolin in a similar way because the PRMT5
antibody was not efficient for immunoprecipitation. However, by
immunoprecipitating with sDMA antibody, we confirmed that only
a small fraction (<6%) of nucleolin was sDMA-modified, which

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

presumably reflects the amount of nucleolin that is bound to
PRMT5 (Fig. 3D).
Association with PRMT5 is mediated by the RGG domain of
nucleolin. To further investigate which domain of nucleolin is
responsible for the interaction with PRMT5, binding assays
were done using several recombinant nucleolin polypeptides (see
Fig. 4A). These recombinant proteins contained the first two RNA
binding domains (RBD1,2) and/or the arginine-glycine repeat (RGG)
domain fused at their NH2-terminal ends to a MBP tag. Only these
domains were investigated because the NH2-terminal domain of
nucleolin cannot be expressed in E. coli and the RBD3,4 domain is
subject to partial proteolysis,7 probably by autodegradation (10).

AS1411 Alters Distribution of PRMT5-Nucleolin Complex

After in vitro incubation of purified MBP-fusion proteins with
DU145 cell lysates, bound proteins were recovered using maltose
affinity gel beads. As shown in Fig. 4B, no PRMT5 was recovered in
the precipitate when the recombinant protein contained the MBP
tag alone or MBP-tagged RNA binding domains (RBD1,2). In
contrast, when MBP was fused to either RGG or RBD1,2-RGG,
PRMT5 was precipitated. These results indicate that the RGG
COOH-terminal domain of nucleolin is the minimal domain
required for interaction of nucleolin with PRMT5 and that RBD1,2
can promote the RGG-PRMT5 interaction. When the same samples
were Western blotted using the SYM10 antibody, there was also
strong staining of a band corresponding to the MBP-RBD1,2-RGG
fragment, confirming our previous postulate that nucleolin is a
substrate for sDMA modification by PRMT5.
AS1411 causes up-regulation of some PRMT5 target genes,
including tumor-suppressor ST7 and cyclin E2. Previous work
by Pal et al. (29) has shown that recruitment of PRMT5 to the
promoter regions of tumor-suppressor genes, ST7 and NM23, leads

to transcriptional repression of these genes due to sDMA
modification at R8 of histone H3. These two genes, and the cyclin
E2 gene, were up-regulated in cells when antisense RNA was used
to reduce levels of PRMT5 (29). Based on our observations that
levels of PRMT5 are reduced in the nuclei of AS1411-treated cells
and because PRMT5 acts as a transcriptional repressor, we
predicted that PRMT5 target genes would be up-regulated in
AS1411-treated cells. To test this theory, we analyzed expression
levels of selected PRMT5 target genes by real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using RNA from untreated, AS1411treated, or control-treated DU145 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A,
AS1411-treated DU145 cells exhibited a 3.9-fold and 2.2-fold higher
expression of cyclin E2 and ST7 mRNA, respectively, compared with
untreated cells. These values are comparable with the changes
observed in the previous study where antisense RNA was used to
deplete PRMT5 in NIH-3T3 cells (29). However, in contrast to the
previous study, expression of the NM23 gene was not significantly
changed in AS1411-treated DU45 cells, suggesting that regulation
by PRMT5 may be cell type dependent. To confirm that the
observed changes in ST7 and cyclin E2 expression were due to
decreased binding of PRMT5 to the promoter regions of those
genes, we next did ChIP experiments. These showed that the levels
of PRMT5 associated with the cyclin E2 and ST7 promoters were
significantly decreased in cells treated with AS1411 (see Fig. 5B),
whereas the control oligonucleotide had no effect on PRMT5
(Fig. 5B) and AS1411 did not affect the positive control ChIP (data
not shown). Because cyclin E2 is a cell cycle regulator that
accelerates G1-S, we also examined if there was a perturbation of
the cell cycle in AS1411-treated cells. We found that there was a
small but significant increase in the proportion of cells that were in
S phase and a reduction in G2-M (Fig. 5C).

Protein arginine methylation (R-methylation) is a posttranslational modification that results in the addition of one or two
methyl groups to the guanidino nitrogen atoms of arginine. There
are at least nine human PRMTs responsible for arginine
methylation and they have been classified in two major classes:
Type I enzymes promote the formation of asymmetrical N-N G, N Gdimethylated arginines (aDMA) and type II enzymes catalyze the
formation of symmetrical N-N G, N¶G-dimethylated arginines
(sDMA), whereas N-N G-monomethylarginine is thought to be an
intermediate formed by both types (31–36). Consensus sequences
for various PRMTs have not been defined, although most
R-methylated proteins identified to date are modified at glycine/
arginine–rich repeats. The biological function of arginine methylation is also not yet fully understood, but there is credible evidence
for roles in transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, signal
transduction, DNA repair, and subcellular protein transport. These
roles have been detailed recently in several excellent reviews about
arginine methylation (31–36).
In this study, we have identified a specific interaction between
nucleolin and the major type II arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5.
This seems to be a novel finding because, although an earlier
proteomics analysis identified PRMT5 (also known as JBP1 and
SKB1) as a protein that coprecipitated with nucleolin, the PRMT5nucleolin interaction was previously dismissed as nonspecific (37).
In contrast, our current work clearly shows that the PRMT5nucleolin interaction is specific and occurs in cultured DU145
prostate cancer cells. Our data also indicate that PRMT5-associated

nucleolin contains sDMA, which strongly suggests that nucleolin
is a substrate for modification by PRMT5. Interestingly, the RGG
domain of nucleolin has been previously shown to be a substrate for
asymmetrical dimethylation by the type I enzyme, PRMT1 (38).
However, it is not unprecedented for a protein to be a target for both
types of PRMTs and there is mounting evidence that there can be
competition between type I and type II enzymes for the same
arginines, with aDMA or sDMA modifications having opposing
effects (reviewed in ref. 31). An example is the R3 residue of histone

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

H4, which can be modified by PRMT1, leading to transcriptional
activation, or by PRMT5, which results in transcriptional repression.
Another protein that can contain both aDMA and sDMA
modifications is the sliceosomal protein, SmB, and, in this case,
the type of arginine methylation was related to the nuclear or
cytoplasmic localization of the protein. In terms of cell biology, the
significance of nucleolin methylation is not yet known. Its role in
nucleolar localization and nucleic acid binding has been studied, but
methylation of the RGG domain was found to be nonessential for

AS1411 Alters Distribution of PRMT5-Nucleolin Complex

these functions (39, 40). It may be relevant that there is substantial
overlap between the biological functions of nucleolin and PRMT5; for
instance, both have been implicated in transcriptional regulation,
chromatin remodeling, spermatocyte maturation, RNA processing,
complex formation with SMN1, and mediating nuclear/cytoplasmic
localization (10–12, 31–36, 41–47). It is also tempting to speculate
that the apparently inconsistent roles (sometimes activating,
sometimes repressing) of nucleolin in transcriptional regulation
(reviewed in refs. 10–12) could be explained in terms of whether it is
associated with (or methylated by) PRMT1 or PRMT5. In short,
further research will be required to fully elucidate the relationships
involved, but the results presented herein clearly point to an
intriguing link between nucleolin biology and arginine methylation,
especially with regard to transcriptional regulation and nuclearcytoplasmic shuttling.
Another major result of this study is the discovery that the
nucleolin-targeted aptamer, AS1411, can alter the cellular localization and activity of PRMT5. This has a number of important
implications for the mechanism of this novel anticancer agent.
The role of PRMT5 in cancer biology has not been widely studied,
but there is some evidence that increased PRMT5 levels
(particularly, nuclear PRMT5) are associated with malignant
transformation. A recent report identified PRMT5 (alternatively
called SKB1) as a gene that was specifically overexpressed, at both
the mRNA and protein levels, in gastric cancers compared with
normal gastric tissues (48). Immunohistochemistry studies comparing normal gastric tissue with moderately and poorly differentiated carcinomas found that, not only was there an increase in the
overall levels of PRMT5, but that there was a shift from cytoplasmic
to nuclear staining as the degree of malignancy increased (48).
Other evidence for the significance of PRMT5 in cancer comes from
Pal et al. (29). These authors have shown that stable expression of
FLAG-tagged PRMT5 can transform NIH-3T3 cells, such that they
proliferated faster than wild-type cells and could grow in an
anchorage-independent manner. Conversely, cells that were stably
transfected with antisense PRMT5 cells grew considerably slower
than wild-type cells. To investigate the mechanism of this effect,
these researchers carried out microarray studies to compare gene
expression in cells expressing antisense PRMT5 (which had PRMT5
mRNA levels reduced by >90%) with wild-type cells. Two tumor
suppressors, ST7 and NM23, were found to be up-regulated in the
antisense cell line and were subsequently identified as direct
targets of PRMT5-mediated transcriptional repression. The cell
cycle regulator, cyclin E2, was also induced in the antisense PRMT5
cells, although it was not determined if this was a direct effect. We
have shown here that treatment of DU145 prostate cancer cells
with AS1411 reduces the levels of PRMT5 in the nucleus, thereby
causing an increase in ST7 and cyclin E2 expression due to a
decrease in the amount of PRMT5 that is associated with their
promoter regions. Another recent report described how a nuclearto-cytoplasmic shift of a PRMT5 repressor complex resulted in
up-regulation of target gene expression (49). We predict that
AS1411-induced derepression of ST7 and cyclin E2 genes, and
possibly other PRMT5 target genes that have not been identified
here, may contribute to the biological activity of AS1411. The
human ST7 gene was first recognized as a candidate tumor
suppressor based on its chromosomal location (7q31.1) at a site of
frequent loss of heterozygosity and its reduced expression in some
types of cancer (50). Multiple studies failed to find tumorassociated mutations in the ST7 gene (reviewed in ref. 50),
suggesting that inactivation is due to epigenetic silencing at the

www.aacrjournals.org

level of chromatin organization, probably mediated by PRMT5
(29, 51). More importantly, the role of ST7 as a tumor suppressor
has been shown at the functional level. Studies have shown that
ectopic expression of the ST7 gene in human breast or prostate
cancer cells resulted in reduced anchorage-independent growth
and suppression of tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice (50).
Thus, AS1411-induced up-regulation of ST7 could evidently
contribute to its anticancer activity. The possible role of cyclin E2
up-regulation in the mechanism of AS1411 is less obvious because
this gene is a cell cycle regulator that controls the G1-S transition
and is generally considered to be growth promoting. Nonetheless, it
is worth noting that the antisense PRMT5 cells grew slower than
wild-type cells, even while cyclin E2 levels were enhanced (29). Also,
cancer cells treated with AS1411 are accumulated in S phase
(Fig. 5C), consistent with previous reports that GRO29A (a longer
version of AS1411) induces cell cycle arrest in S phase (4).
Our results have additional broader implications in terms of the
mechanism of AS1411 activity. Previous work has indicated that
GROs bind directly and specifically to nucleolin protein (3), and that
antiproliferative activity across a series of GROs is correlated with
their nucleolin binding affinity (3, 5, 6). These data support our
assertion that GROs, including AS1411, work as nucleolin-targeted
aptamers. On the other hand, no obvious changes in the levels or
localization of nucleolin are observed in cancer cells treated with
AS1411 or other active GROs. Therefore, we hypothesized that
AS1411 modulates the activity of nucleolin by altering its
posttranslational modifications and/or affecting its interactions
with other proteins. Our previous research (7) has identified NEMO/
IKKg, which is a critical factor in nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)
activation, as a protein that coprecipitated with AS1411 and
nucleolin. In that study, we found that the presence of AS1411
increased the association of NEMO with nucleolin in the cytoplasm,
resulting in abrogation of NF-nB signaling (7). In this article, we
have described how AS1411 affects both a posttranslational
modification (symmetrical arginine dimethylation) of nucleolin
and the localization of a specific nucleolin complex (with PRMT5).
Interestingly, these changes were linked to nuclear-to-cytoplasmic
redistribution of the nucleolin-PRMT5 complex, suggesting that the
shuttling function of nucleolin may be affected by AS1411.
Moreover, only a small proportion of cellular nucleolin, consisting
of the sDMA-modified protein, was affected by AS1411, which
explains why there is no obvious change in total nucleolin levels in
cells treated with AS1411. Taken together, our results support the
hypothesis that aptamer-induced perturbations of nucleolin (or a
subset of nucleolin complexes) are responsible for the biological
effects of AS1411. Therefore, in addition to being a promising
therapeutic agent, AS1411 may be a useful tool for investigating the
regulation and functions of this extraordinary protein. This may
ultimately lead to important insights into tumor biology, because
there is mounting evidence that overexpression of nucleolin can
contribute to cancer development and progression (11).
