ABSTRACT
Here we provide evidence to link sub-lethal oxidative stress to lysosome
biogenesis. Exposure of cells to sub-lethal concentrations of exogenously added
hydrogen peroxide resulted in cytosol to nuclear translocation of the Transcription
Factor EB (TFEB), the master controller of lysosome biogenesis and function. Nuclear
translocation of TFEB was dependent upon the activation of a cathepsin-caspase
3 signaling pathway, downstream of lysosomal membrane permeabilization and
accompanied by a significant increase in lysosome numbers as well as induction
of TFEB-dependent lysosome-associated genes expression such as Ctsl, Lamp2
and its spliced variant Lamp2a, Neu1, Ctsb, Sqstm1, and Atg9b. The effects of sublethal oxidative stress on lysosomal gene expression and biogenesis were rescued
upon gene silencing of caspase 3 and TFEB. Notably, caspase 3 activation was not
associated with phenotypic hallmarks of apoptosis, evidenced by the absence of
caspase 3 substrate cleavage, such as PARP, Lamin A/C or gelsolin. Taken together,
these data demonstrate for the first time an unexpected and non-canonical role of
a cathepsin-caspase 3 axis in the nuclear translocation of TFEB leading to lysosome
biogenesis under conditions of sub-lethal oxidative stress.

INTRODUCTION

is crucial in maintaining normal cellular homeostasis
and survival upon exposure to sub-lethal oxidative stress
[10, 11]. The proposed mechanisms involved in the
activation of autophagy by ROS include inhibition of
mTOR activity [12], activation of extracellular regulated
kinase (ERK) and/or c-Jun N-terminal kinase [13, 14],
nuclear translocation of the high-mobility group box 1
Protein, as shown upon the activation of autophagy by
Apogossypolone [15], increase in Beclin 1 expression,
and inhibition of the cysteine protease Atg4 activity [16].
However, while these mechanisms mainly focus on the
regulation of the formation of autophagic vacuoles, ROS
have also been shown to affect lysosomes [17]. Lysosomes
and lysosomal proteases play important roles in the final
stages of autophagy, such as the fusion of lysosomes
with autophagosomes forming autolysosomes followed
by proteolytic degradation of the engulfed molecules by

Depending on the level of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), cells elicit varied responses to oxidative stress,
such as proliferation, growth arrest, apoptosis, autophagy
or necrosis [1, 2]. An increase in intracellular ROS is also
associated with cellular aging, which is attributed to the
accumulation of damage to macromolecules upon chronic
oxidative stress [3-5]. Contrarily, some authors have
recently proposed that ROS may actually be involved
in preventing cellular aging and promoting longevity
[6, 7]. In this regard, autophagy has been proposed to
be associated with the prevention of cellular aging [8,
9]. Autophagy is a catabolic mechanism that involves
degradation and clearance of misfolded proteins and
damaged organelles through the action of lysosomes and
lysosomal hydrolases. Of note, an increase in autophagy

lysosomal proteases [19]. Notably, lysosomal numbers,
composition and function are sensitive to various
external and internal stresses including redox stress
[18]. For example, exposure of HeLa cells to H2O2,
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), and UVB irradiation led
to an increase in lysosome numbers as well as lysosomal
activity [17].
Lysosomes are ubiquitous membrane-bound
intracellular organelles that are critical in pH-dependent
macromolecule degradation, endocytic, heterophagy and
autophagy pathways. In contrast to the rather simplified
view of lysosomes as waste bags, lysosomes are now
recognized as advanced organelles that mediate a variety
of physiological processes crucial for the regulation of cell
homeostasis, such as cellular clearance, lipid homeostasis
and energy metabolism [20, 21]. A major player in
the regulation of lysosomal biogenesis and function
is the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) [22]. TFEB
induces the up-regulation of lysosomal genes including
lysosomal cathepsins, lysosomal membrane proteins, and
components of the vacuolar H+-ATPase [22, 23]. TFEB
also regulates lysosome clearance by facilitating lysosome
exocytosis [24]. Under basal conditions in most cell types,
TFEB is located in the cytoplasm; however, under specific
conditions, such as starvation or lysosomal dysfunction,
TFEB rapidly translocates to the nucleus [25, 26]. This
process is controlled by the phosphorylation status of
TFEB; phosphorylated TFEB is located predominantly
in the cytoplasm, whereas the dephosphorylated form
is found in the nucleus [25, 26]. Despite the reported

role of ROS on the physiology of lysosomes, the effects
of sub-lethal oxidative stress on lysosome biogenesis
and function have not yet been assessed. In the present
report, we demonstrate that sub-lethal oxidative stress
induces lysosome biogenesis and show for the first time
an unexpected role for a cathepsin-caspase 3 axis in the
activation of TFEB, the master controller of lysosome
biogenesis and function.

RESULTS
Evidence of sub-lethal oxidative stress in L6 cells
upon exposure to 50µM of exogenous H2O2
A concentration of H2O2 that induces oxidative
stress in the absence of cell death was determined by
exposing cells to 50µM or 150µM of exogenous H2O2.
Results showed that incubation with 50µM of exogenous
H2O2 neither significantly affected cell morphology
(Figure 1A) nor resulted in an increase in the number of
cells in the sub-G1 phase (marker of apoptosis) (Figure
1B). In contrast, cells exposed to 150µM H2O2 showed
shrunken and rounded cell morphology (Figure 1A), and
an increase in the number of cells in the sub-G1 phase that
was comparable to the number of apoptotic cells detected
following exposure to the classical inducer of apoptosis,
staurosporine (STS) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, despite
no evidence of untoward effects on cell morphology and

survival, exposure to 50µM of exogenous H2O2 resulted
in an increase in the expression of the stress-response
protein HO-1, thereby indicating the induction of sublethal oxidative stress. The expression of HO-1 could
be detected as early as 3h and sustained for at least 48h
following the cells’ exposure to the oxidant (Figure 1C).
Note that the increase in HO-1 expression in the control
and H2O2 treated cells at 9h and 12h time points may
reflect cell cycle- dependent expression of HO-1 [27] [28].
HO-1 expression was also detected in cells exposed to
150µM H2O2 but not in cells incubated with staurosporine

effect of 50µM H2O2 on the lysosomal compartment. Cells
were exposed to 50µM H2O2 before AO uptake and LTR
staining were performed. Results showed a significant
increase in the uptake of AO from 8h to 48h (Figure 2A)
and LTR staining at 12h, 24h and 48h following cells’
exposure to H2O2 (Figure 2B). To confirm the effect of
H2O2 on lysosomal compartment, expression of the
lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin B, was determined
using immunostaining in cells exposed to 50µM H2O2
for 24 hours. Figure 2C shows an increase in cathepsin B
expression in cells exposed to sub-lethal oxidative stress.
Finally, to rule out the effect of a sub-lethal oxidative
stress on other cellular compartments, Mitotracker, and
antibodies against calnexin, syntaxin 16 and Rab7 were
used to assess the effect on mitochondria, endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), the Golgi complex and late endosomes,
respectively. Results showed no increase in mitochondria
number or the expression of calnexin, syntaxin 16 and
Rab7 proteins (Figure 2D). Taken together, these data
support that sub-lethal oxidative stress specifically affects
lysosome biogenesis.

Sub-lethal oxidative stress induces an increase

was observed in H2O2-treated cells (Figure 3A and 3B,
Supplementary Figure S13). Moreover, analysis of the
mRNA expression of 18 lysosomal and autophagy-related
TFEB target genes [22, 25, 29, 30] in untreated versus
H2O2-treated cells showed that 4 genes associated with
lysosome function (Ctsl, Lamp2 and its spliced variant
Lamp2a, Neu1 and Ctsb) and 2 genes associated with
autophagy (Sqstm1 and Atg9b) were induced (at least 1.5
fold) by sub-lethal oxidative stress, compared to untreated
cells (Table 1). Gene silencing of TFEB using a specific
TFEB siRNA (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure S13 )
significantly prevented the increase in mRNA expression
of these 6 genes following cells’ exposure to sub-lethal
oxidative stress (Figure 3D). Finally, a decrease in TFEB
expression prevented the increase in lysosome numbers
following cells’ exposure to 50µM of exogenous H2O2
(Figure 3E, 3F and 3G).

Apart from being the master regulator of lysosome
biogenesis, TFEB also controls autophagy by positively
regulating autophagosome formation and autophagosomelysosome fusion, both in vitro and in vivo [25]. Using
the Cyto-ID autophagy detection assay, we observed
an increase in the numbers of autophagic vesicles at 24
and 48h following the exposure of cells to 50µM H2O2.
The increase in Cyto-ID staining induced by sub-lethal
oxidative stress was comparable to that induced by Torin1,
a classical inducer of autophagy (Figure 4A). However,
while decreasing TFEB expression prevented lysosome
biogenesis (Figure 3E, 3F and 3G), it did not significantly

to sub-lethal concentration of H2O2 (Figure 4B). The effect
of siTFEB on the increase in autophagic vacuoles assessed
using a mixed model method as described in materials and
methods was not statistically significant (P>0.05). This
result suggests that the autophagic vacuoles formation

upon cells’ exposure to a sub-lethal oxidative stress is
independent of TFEB (Figure 4B). Moreover, although
the co-localization of Cyto-ID and LTR (Figure 4C) and
GFP-LC3 and LTR (Supplementary Figure S3) staining
supported a fusion of lysosome and autophagosome
leading to autolysosome formation, no autophagic flux

sub-lethal oxidative stress (Figure 4D).

activity by E64D (Supplementary Figure S6A) or zFAFMK (Supplementary Figure S6B) was detected even
at the concentration of the inhibitors as high as 100µM.
In contrast, addition of 20µM of pan-caspase inhibitor,
zVAD-FMK completely abrogated caspase 3 activity from
the same STS-treated cell lysate (Supplementary Figure
S6). Taken together these results support that cathepsins,
in particular cathepsins B or/and L, are responsible for the
activation of caspase 3 upon cells’ exposure to a sub-lethal
concentrations of H2O2.

Sub-lethal oxidative stress activates caspase 3
Although exposure of cells to 50µM H2O2 was
insufficient to induce apoptotic cell death (Figure 1A
and 1B), activation of caspase 3 was observed in cells
exposed to 50µM H2O2. Caspase 3 enzymatic activity and
protein cleavage was time-dependent. Caspase 3 activity
was significantly lower and detected at a later time point
compared to the activation of caspase 3 induced in cells
exposed to the apoptotic trigger STS (Figure 5A and 5B).
Interestingly, unlike in STS-treated cells where cleaved
caspase 3 relocated to the cytosol following a transient
accumulation in the nucleus (Supplementary Figure S4),
cleaved caspase 3 was retained in the nucleus in cells
exposed to 50µM H2O2 (Figure 5C and 5D). Finally, the
absence of the cleavage of classical apoptotic substrates
such as the structural proteins, Gelsolin (Figure 5E),
Lamin A/C (Figure 5F), and the DNA damage repair
protein PARP (Figure 5G) in 50µM H2O2-treated cells
concurs with the absence of apoptotic cell death in cells
exposed to a sub-lethal oxidative stress.

Sub-lethal oxidative stress induces lysosomal
membrane permeabilization
In vitro cleavage of caspases by cathepsins has
previously been reported [31, 32]. In particular, two studies
demonstrated the activation of caspase-3-like protease
by digitonin-treated lysosomes and the participation of a
cathepsin L-type protease in the activation of caspase-3
[33, 34]. As cathepsins are lysosomal proteases, while
caspase 3 is a cytosolic protease, relocalization of
cathepsins to the cytosol would be necessary to execute
the processing of caspase 3. Release of cathepsins and
other lysosomal hydrolases from the lysosome to the
cytosol is shown to occur through a process called
Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization (LMP). To
measure LMP, acridine orange (AO) relocation assay was
used. Cells were pre-loaded with 10µM AO for 30min
before being exposed to 50µM H2O2 and the LMP was
measured at indicated time points. FACS analysis of AO
fluorescence revealed a transient but significant (8% and
14%) increase in green fluorescence intensity at 2h and 4h
respectively, following exposure of cells to H2O2 (Figure
6G). In addition, 4 hours following cells’ exposure to the
sub-lethal oxidative stress and the time of maximum LMP,
an increase in activated cathepsin B was detected using
cell fractionation in the cytosol of cells exposed to 50µM
H2O2 (Figure 6H)

Sub-lethal oxidative stress induces caspase 3
activation in a cathepsin-dependent manner
While exposure to the classical apoptosis inducer
STS resulted in the activation of the initiator caspases
8 and 9, no increase in caspase 8 and 9 activity were
detected in cells exposed to sub-lethal oxidative stress
(Figure 6A and 6B). Furthermore, the pan-caspase
inhibitor zVAD-FMK (Figure 6C) or the tetra-peptide
inhibitors of caspase 8 (zIETD-FMK) or caspase 9
(zLEHD-FMK) did not inhibit caspase 3 cleavage in
H2O2-treated cells (Figure 6D). In order to determine the
protease(s) involved in the activation of caspase 3, cells
were pre-incubated with different protease inhibitors
before the addition of 50µM H2O2. Inhibition of aspartate
proteases using pepstatin A (Supplementary Figure S5A)
or serine proteases by pefabloc (Supplementary Figure
S5B) or calpains using calpeptin (Supplementary Figure
S5C) did not significantly block the activation of caspase
3. On the contrary, the presence of the general cysteine
protease inhibitor E64D (Figure 6E) and cathepsin B and L
inhibitor zFA-FMK (Figure 6F) significantly inhibited the
increase in caspase 3 activity. To eliminate the possibility
that the effect of E64D or zFA-FMK inhibitors on caspase
3 activity might be due to a direct cross inhibition of
caspase activity rather than the inhibition of an upstream
cysteine protease involved in the cleavage of caspase 3,
caspase 3 enzymatic activity was measured upon addition
of the inhibitors to STS-treated cell lysate that contains
fully activate caspase 3. No inhibition of caspase 3

Inhibition of caspase 3 prevents the activation of
TFEB upon sub-lethal oxidative stress
Having shown that sub-lethal oxidative stress
concurrently induces lysosome biogenesis in a TFEB
dependent manner and an LMP/cathepsin-dependent
activation of caspase 3, we asked whether the two events
could be associated. Indeed, inhibition of caspase 3
activity using the caspase 3 inhibitor zDEVD-FMK
reduced the nuclear translocation of TFEB (Figure
7A and B). In addition, inhibition of caspase 3 activity
using the zDEVD-FMK inhibitor (Figure 7C and 7D) or
silencing of caspase 3 gene expression (Figure 7E and
7F, Supplementary Figure S8) prevented the increase in
lysosome numbers induced by a sub-lethal oxidative stress
and prevented the increase in the mRNA expression of the

stress induces lysosome biogenesis through activation
of TFEB in a caspase 3-dependent manner. Activation
of the caspase cascade has long been a hallmark of
apoptosis. In particular, biochemical and morphological
changes during apoptosis, such as cell shrinkage and
membrane blebbing [44], DNA fragmentation [45], and
nuclear condensation [46] are manifestations of caspase
3 substrates cleavage. Nevertheless, in recent years, there
have been increasing evidence of caspases activation and
cleavage of their substrates in the absence of apoptotic
cell death. The involvement of caspases in the absence
of cell death has been demonstrated in developmental
processes such as erythropoiesis and spermatid maturation
[47-50]. Furthermore, caspases play important roles in
differentiation of various cell types, such as osteogenic
differentiation of bone marrow stromal stem cells [51],
neuronal differentiation of primary derived neuronal stem
cells [52], and in proliferation and differentiation of adult
hematopoietic stem cells [53]. Recent findings from our
lab also revealed a role of caspase 3 in regulating gene
expression during oxidative stress. Caspase 3 and 6 were
shown to regulate the expression of the Na+/H+ exchanger
(NHE1) during oxidative stress in an iron-dependent
pathway [54]. In the present study, we demonstrate yet
another function of caspase 3 upon exposure of cells to
sub-lethal oxidative stress.
Compared to their role in apoptotic cell death,
the signaling pathway(s) activated by caspases in the
absence of cell death are less well studied. The classical
pathways leading to the activation of caspase 3 involve
the activation of initiator caspase 8 and/or caspase 9.
In the present report, caspase 8 and caspase 9 were not
activated and inhibition of either of the protease did not
affect the activation of caspase 3. However, cathepsins
were shown to be involved in the activation of caspase
3. Although we did not identify which cathepsin(s) was/
were directly involved in the activation of caspase 3,
the result obtained using the cathepsins inhibitor zFA
suggest that it may be cathepsin B or L. Direct cleavage of
caspase 3 by cathepsins was previously reported in vitro
[33, 34] and in vivo [55]. In order to activate caspase 3,
active cathepsins need to translocate from the lysosome
to the cytosol, a process that involves the induction of
LMP. Indeed, LMP was observed 2h and 4h following the
exposure of L6 to sub-lethal oxidative stress. The apparent
transient nature of the LMP suggests that it was different
from the lysosome rupture seen during necrotic and
apoptotic cell death, which often results in massive release
of lysosomal proteins and digestion of cellular proteins.
Interestingly, it has previously been reported that in cases
where cathepsins were detected in the cytosol, lysosomes
could still be labelled with lysosomotropic fluorochromes,
indicating that the cytosol-lysosome pH gradient was
maintained [56] and that LMP may occur selectively in
a subset of lysosomes [43]. Hence, the apparent transient
LMP could represent an LMP in a subset of lysosomes, 2

Chelation of iron prevents the activation of the
caspase 3-TFEB-lysosome biogenesis by sublethal oxidative stress
As the main site of organelle and protein
degradation, lysosomes accumulate large amounts of
free iron, which is susceptible to react with ROS during
oxidative stress [39-41]. Reaction of iron with ROS in
the lysosomes is associated with LMP [41-43]. Indeed,
chelation of iron by 50µM Deferoxamine (DFO) and
50µM Deferiprone (DFP) prevented LMP induced by
sub-lethal oxidative stress (Figure 8A). Inhibition of LMP
upon iron chelation prevented the increase of caspase 3
activity (Figure 8B), the translocation of TFEB to the
nucleus (Figure 8C), the increase in TFEB target genes
expression Lamp2, Ctsb, Ctsl, Neu1, Atg9b and Sqstm1
(Figure 8D), and lysosome biogenesis (Figure 8E) in
cells exposed to 50µM H2O2. Finally, supporting that the
pathway involved in the activation of caspase 3 by sublethal oxidative stress is different from the activation
of caspase 3 upon the induction of apoptotic cell death,
chelation of iron was unable to block STS-induced caspase
3 activation (Figure 8F).

Activation of the caspase 3-TFEB-lysosome
biogenesis pathway by a sublethal oxidative stress
is not specific to the L6 cell lines
Having established an oxidative stress-dependent
lysosome biogenesis pathway in L6 myoblasts involving
caspase-3-mediated activation of TFEB in the absence
of apoptotic cell death, we asked whether the same
pathway could be activated in other cell lines. As shown
in Supplementary Figure S9A, exposure of mouse
embryonic fibroblast (MEF) or human fibroblast IMR90
cell line to sub-lethal oxidative stress, did not have any
effect on cell morphology. Despite the absence of cell
death, we observed the activation of caspase 3 which
could be inhibited by the cathepsin inhibitor, zFAFMK (Supplementary Figure S9B) and an increase
in lysosomal gene expression upon exposure to sublethal concentrations of H2O2 (Supplementary Table S1;
Supplementary Table S2). Lastly, inhibition of caspase
3 using zDEVD minimized the increase in lysosome
biogenesis in MEF and IMR90 cells upon exposure to
sub-lethal concentrations of H2O2 (Supplementary Figure
S9C).

and 4 hours following exposure to a sub-lethal oxidative
stress. The limited amount of cathepsin relocated in the
cytosol would then allow for a controlled activation of
caspase 3 that will not allow the activation of apoptotic
cell death.
The actual mechanism of LMP is largely unknown
although ROS is reported to be one of the common
mediators [57, 58]. Lysosome membranes are susceptible
to oxidative stress due to the pool of labile, redox active
intra-lysosomal iron, produced by the degradation of
metalloproteins [59]. Exogenously-added H2O2 diffuses
readily across the lysosome membranes and reacts with
intra-lysosomal iron to form other ROS, such as •OH and
OH-, through the Fenton reaction [60]. Such formation
of ROS may result in peroxidation of the lysosome
membranes and thus induce LMP [61]. In the present
study, chelating iron prevented the selective LMP and the
activation of the caspase 3-dependent lysosome biogenesis
pathway.
Several reviews have elegantly summarized the
involvement of caspases in the absence of cell death,
which point to mechanisms acting singularly or in
combination for restricted cleavage of substrates and
limited execution of apoptosis [62, 63]. In the present
report, moderate activation of caspase 3 due to a limited
cytosolic relocation of cathepsin(s) combined with
the retention of cleaved caspase 3 in the nucleus may

account for restricted substrate cleavage and absence of
the apoptotic phenotype in cells exposed to sub-lethal
oxidative stress.
While regulation of lysosome biogenesis by caspase
3 via TFEB is not reported in the literature, it was reported
previously that a decrease in mTOR activity accompanied
by its de-phosphorylation is associated with the activation
of TFEB. In agreement with the effect of a redox stress
on mTOR [12] we observed a de-phosphorylation of
mTOR (Supplementary Figure S10) similar to the dephosphorylation observed upon cells’ exposure to Torin.
However, knock-down of caspase 3 protein expression
did not prevent the decrease in phosphorylated mTOR
following cells’ exposure to a sub-lethal oxidative stress
(Supplementary Figure S11). These data support that
the cathepsin(s)-caspase 3 dependent translocation of
TFEB from the cytosol to the nucleus is a novel pathway
independent of mTOR.
Activation of caspase 3 has been shown to inhibit
autophagy via cleavage of ATG-related genes such as
beclin-1 [64]. On the other hand, Sirois et al. reported
that caspase 3 regulates the formation of the autophagic
network in nutrient-deprived endothelial cells by
controlling the maturation and release of autophagic
vacuoles, although it has no effect on the autophagic
flux [65]. Similarly, our results show the formation of
autophagic vacuoles without the detection of autophagic

Figure 9: Sublethal oxidative stress activates an mTOR-independent signaling pathway involving the activation of
a LMP-cathepsin-caspase 3 axis leading to the transcription of TFEB-target genes involved in lysosome biogenesis.
We propose that caspase 3-dependent activation of TFEB might be a protective mechanism from cellular aging through activation of
chaperone-mediated or selective autophagy following an increase in lysosome biogenesis in absence of autophagic flux.

flux. Moreover, contrary to the studies in which TFEB is
reported as a master regulator of autophagy, our results
support that upon cells’ exposure to sub-lethal level
of H2O2, TFEB takes part in lysosome biogenesis but
not in the autophagic vacuoles formation. Although we
observed an increase in autophagic vacuoles, this was
independent of TFEB’s transcription activity. Notably, in
most studies showing the effect of TFEB on autophagy,
TFEB was overexpressed. In cells exposed to sub-lethal
oxidative stress, TFEB nuclear translocation is induced
without an increase in TFEB expression. Therefore, the
expression level of TFEB may be important to determine
the subsets of genes activated and the cellular process
they activate. In support of this hypothesis, among the
set of 18 known TFEB target genes assessed for their
increase in transcription following cells’ exposure to a
sub-lethal oxidative stress, only a subset of genes was
activated. Of note, an increase in the Lamp2 splicing
form Lamp2a and Sqstm1 mRNA was detected. Increase
in Lamp2a and p62 (Sqstm1) proteins have both been
associated with chaperone-mediated autophagy [66] and
selective autophagy [67, 68]. Hence, we propose that sublethal oxidative stress might induce selective rather than
macroautophagy via an increase in lysosome numbers in a
caspase 3/TFEB-dependent pathway.
In conclusion, our report demonstrates a role for an
LMP-cathepsin-caspase 3-TFEB axis in the regulation of
lysosome biogenesis during sub-lethal oxidative stress. We
propose that activation of the LMP-cathepsin(s)-caspase
3-TFEB axis could be associated with the acquisition
of a lysosome-dependent clearance phenotype that may
support the pro-survival effect of a sub-lethal oxidative
stress. It should be pointed out that our data did not
support the involvement of an autophagic flux while the
expression of Lamp2 was increased. Hence, activation of a
LMP-cathepsin-caspase 3-TFEB axis leading to lysosome
biogenesis may represent a novel signaling pathway that
contributes to an increase in selective and/or chaperonemediated autophagy rather than macroautophagy and plays
a role in the increase in organism life span induced by low
level of ROS (Figure 9). Finally, we also demonstrate that
the LMP-cathepsin(s)- caspase 3 axis was also activated
using etoposide (Supplementary Figure S12).

(210 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES pH
7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 300 μM Pefabloc, 100 μM PMSF) for
45 min on ice. Cells were lysed with a 23-G needle and
centrifuged for 5 min at 700g to attain pellet consisting of
nuclei and cellular debris. The supernatant was centrifuged
at 100,000g for 45min to separate the cytosol (supernatant)
and the membrane/lysosomal fraction (the resulting pellet,
which contains all other organelles except the nuclei, was
resuspended in MSH buffer + 1% triton). The cell lysate
(cytosolic and membrane/lysosomal fraction) obtained
was resolved by SDS-PAGE and protein of interest was
detected using SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Thermo Scientific, 34080) with Biorad ChemiDoc™ MP
System.

slide for confocal microscopy analysis using a FITC filter.
Fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes was visualized
by GFP-LC3 and LTR immunofluoresnce analysis. GFPLC3 plasmid was obtained from Dr Liu Dan (Department
of Physiology, National University of Singapore Prof
S. Pervaiz Lab). Cells were transiently transfected
with the GFP-LC3 plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000
(ThermoFisher Scientific, 1168-019), according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were then treated
with 50µM H2O2 24h after transfection. At 24h, cells
were stained with Lysotracker® Red DND-99 (LTR)
(Molecular Probes, L-7528) for 45min. Cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30min at room temperature
and cover slips were mounted for confocal analysis using
Olympus FluoView1000 (FV1000; Olympus) confocal
microscope.

Analysis of lysosomal membrane permeabilization
with the acridine orange relocation assay

compare the effect of H2O2 on the outcome in presence
of various inhibitors or upon silencing of different genes.
Comparative ΔΔCt method was used to determine gene
expression 24 hours following cells exposure to 50M
H2O2. Expression levels were normalized to the expression
levels of the housekeeping gene 18s. All Western Blot
and immunofluorescence images are representative of at
least three independent experiments. Two-tailed unpaired
Student’s t-test was performed when appropriate; using the
Microsoft Excel software, with p-value (P) of less than
0.05 considered significant. All numerical data including
error bars represent the mean +/- SEM (Standard error of
mean).

Cells were incubated with 10µM Acridine Orange
(AO) (Molecular Probes,A1301) for 30min at 37ºC
before treatment with H2O2. AO cytosolic staining (Green
fluorescence) was analyzed by flow cytometry using
the FITC-A channel (BD FACSCanto II). Results are
expressed as the mean +/- SEM of arbitrary fluorescence
of each treatment of at least 3 independent experiments.

Lysosomal
numbers
were
assessed
by
immunofluorescence with LTR or by flow cytometry with
AO staining. For immunofluorescence, cells seeded on
cover slips were stained with LTR for 45 min, 37ºC. Cells
were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30min
at room temperature and cover slips were mounted for
confocal analysis using Olympus FluoView1000 confocal
microscope with identical acquisition parameters for
the same image session. Quantification of LTR staining
was done by ImageJ software. Cell of interest was
defined using the drawing tool. Mean fluorescence of the
LTR staining was obtained by selecting the “measure”
option. After deducting background staining, the mean
fluorescence of at least 50 cells from each treatment
was used for statistical analysis. Data is represented as
mean +/- SEM. For flow cytometric analysis of lysosome
numbers, cells were exposed to a solution of 10µM AO
for 30min after treatment with H2O2. AO staining (red
fluorescence) were analyzed by flow cytometryusing the
PerCP-A channel (BD FACSCanto II). Flow cytometry
data were analyzed with CyflogicTM software. Results are
expressed as the mean +/- SEM of arbitrary fluorescence
of each treatment of at least 3 independent experiments.

Mixed model was utilized to evaluate the effect of
cells exposure to H2O2 in control medium versus cells
exposed to H2O2 in presence of inhibitors or following
gene silencing on different outcomes such as lysosome
number, autophagic vacuole formation, and caspase 3
activity with the consideration that the correlation of
the outcomes was obtained from the same experiment
setting or same plate. Compound symmetric structure
was chosen to model the variance-covariance matrix.
A full factorial model, which included 2 main effects
and 1 interaction, was used to assess the effect of H2O2
upon the presence of inhibitor or the silencing of a gene.
Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was carried out to
