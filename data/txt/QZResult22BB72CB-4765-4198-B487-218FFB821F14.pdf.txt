BACKGROUND: The current trial evaluated 2 common therapies for patients with advanced prostate cancer, docetaxel and hormonal therapy (HT), in the surgical adjuvant setting. METHODS: TAX-3501 was a randomized, phase 3, adjuvant study post-radical prostatectomy
(RP) in high-risk patients with prostate cancer (n 5 228) comparing 18 months of HT with (CHT) without docetaxel chemotherapy either
immediately (I) or deferred (D). High-risk disease was defined as a 5-year freedom-from-disease-progression rate of  60% as predicted
by a post-RP nomogram. Progression-free survival (PFS), including prostate-specific antigen disease recurrence, was the primary endpoint. The authors also assessed the accuracy of the nomogram and analyzed testosterone recovery in 108 patients treated with HT who
had at least 1 posttreatment testosterone value. RESULTS: Between December 2005 and September 2007, 228 patients were randomized
between the treatment cohorts. TAX-3501 was terminated prematurely because of enrollment challenges, leaving it underpowered to
detect differences in PFS. After a median follow-up of 3.4 years (interquartile range, 2.3-3.8 years), 39 of 228 patients (17%) demonstrated PSA disease progression, and metastatic disease progression occurred in 1 patient. The median time to baseline testosterone recovery after the completion of treatment was prolonged at 487 days (95% confidence interval, 457-546 days). The nomogram’s predicted
versus observed freedom from disease progression was significantly different for the combination D(HT) and D(CHT) group (P <.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: TAX-3501 illustrated several difficulties involved in conducting postoperative adjuvant systemic trials in men with high-risk
prostate cancer: the lack of consensus regarding patient selection and treatment, the need for long follow-up time, nonvalidated intermediate endpoints, evolving standard approaches, and the need for long-term research support. Except for selected patients at very high-risk of

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide, accounting for > 900,000 new cases and >250,000
deaths per year.1 Although 10-year overall survival (OS) rates after radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy have been reported
to be > 80%, the clinical course of patients with prostate cancer is variable.2,3 A smaller yet significant percentage of patients will
subsequently develop disease recurrence after local treatment, develop distant metastasis, and eventually die of their disease.
Several models have been developed to identify risk factors for the development of recurrent prostate cancer after prostatectomy.4-8 Although men at high-risk who are treated with definitive radiotherapy appear to benefit from neoadjuvant,
concurrent, and adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT) (ie, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists=antagonists), there
has yet to be an established role for systemic adjuvant therapy in men after RP.9-15 Trials addressing this group of men have
been limited in size and number, and although there is some suggestion that higher-risk individuals may benefit from HT,
this has yet to be established as a standard.16-19 Furthermore, at the time of this trial’s inception, adjuvant docetaxel, the first

knowledge never been tested in a group of patients other
than those with castration-resistant prostate cancer.20
Herein we report the experience of the TAX-3501
trial, a multinational, randomized clinical trial. TAX-3501
was designed to determine differences in progression-free
survival (PFS) for high-risk men with an undetectable
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level after RP who were
treated with immediate versus deferred HT with or without
docetaxel. This study represents a global effort to determine
the adjuvant roles of docetaxel and HT after RP, the 2
most accepted treatments for advanced prostate cancer at
the time of its design.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants

Men were eligible for this study if they had an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status  1, a
life expectancy of  5 years, histologically confirmed prostatic adenocarcinoma, undergone a RP < 120 days before
randomization, and were deemed to be at high risk of disease recurrence. Pathology of whole mounted specimens
was reviewed centrally (at Johns Hopkins Hospital), at
which point subjects were classified as being at high risk if
they had a 5-year freedom-from-disease-progression (FFP)
rate of  60% according to the postoperative predictive
probability model developed by Kattan et al.5,21,22 This
cutoff was based on consensus agreement among the trial’s
executive steering committee. It should be noted that a
minority of patients (n 5 23) did not have all of the
pathologic variables necessary to calculate their FFP rate.
The consensus agreement among the steering committee

was to assume said variables were negative. Subjects were
also required to have a postoperative PSA level  0.2
ng=mL at least 30 days after RP and within 7 days of
randomization; normal hematologic, renal, and hepatic
function; and normal serum testosterone (ie,  150 ng=dL)
within 6 months of randomization. In addition, patients
were required to have a bone scan, chest x-ray, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan without evidence for
metastasis within 6 months of randomization. Prior systemic therapies for prostate cancer were not allowed.
This study was conducted in 108 countries. Thirtyone of the participating centers were in the United States,
45 were in Europe, 7 were in Australia, 6 were in Canada, 1
was in Mexico, 2 were in South America, 2 were in Asia, 7
were in the Middle East, 4 were in Russia, and 3 were in
South Africa. Patients were registered after signing an Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent specific
to this protocol.
Trial Design

This trial was a prospective, multinational, 2 3 2 factorialdesigned, open-label, randomized phase 3 study performed
in subjects with prostate cancer who were at high risk of
disease recurrence after RP (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT00283062). Eligible patients were randomized
1:1:1:1 to receive hormonal therapy with chemotherapy
(CHT) or without chemotherapy (HT) either immediately
(I) after RP or deferred (D) until the time of disease progression (Fig. 1). Stratification was according to age (aged
 65 years vs aged < 65 years), predicted 5-year FFP rate
per the nomogram (60%-40% vs 40%-20% vs 20%-0%),
and country of the study site (Fig. 2). The primary endpoint of this trial was PFS after systemic treatment. Secondary endpoints were OS and safety.

Interventions

Follow-Up and Endpoints Definition

Docetaxel was administered at a dose of 75 mg=m2
intravenously over 1 hour repeated every 3 weeks for a
total of 6 cycles. Leuprolide at a dose of 22.5 mg was
given subcutaneously every 3 months for a total duration of 18 months of treatment. Standard dose modification criteria for docetaxel toxicity were used.
Leuprolide dosing was constant for the duration of
treatment. The length of treatment was based largely
on consensus within the trial’s executive steering committee. The duration of docetaxel therapy was influenced by pilot data demonstrating the feasibility of 6
cycles of adjuvant therapy.23 Eighteen months of
androgen deprivation therapy was agreed on given that
this roughly corresponded to the interval required to
administer 6 cycles of docetaxel.

Patients receiving chemotherapy were seen before each 3week treatment until completion and then every 3 months
whereas those receiving leuprolide alone were seen every 3
months. Follow-up procedures included blood counts
(before chemotherapy and then every 3 months), blood
chemistries, PSA, and serum testosterone every 3 months.
Bone scans and CT scans were repeated once a year until
disease progression and then every 6 months and=or as
clinically indicated.
Disease progression was defined as PSA, radiographic,
or histological disease progression after systemic treatment
or death from any cause, whichever came first, as measured
from the time of surgery. PSA progression was defined as
the date of the first PSA increase to  0.4 ng=mL. A confirmatory PSA was obtained within 2 weeks from the

initially elevated value of  0.4 ng=mL. For subjects treated
in the deferred treatment arms whose PSA nadir did not
reach < 0.4 ng=mL, the date of PSA progression was taken
to be the date of the nadir. Local disease progression was
considered evidence of disease progression.
Survival was measured from the date of surgery to the
date of death from any cause. PFS was measured from the
date of surgery to the date of disease progression as defined
above. Adverse events were defined per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) guidelines in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0.
Statistical Analysis

This trial was designed to detect a 30% difference in the
median PFS for both comparisons (I(HT) vs D(HT) and
I(CHT) vs D(CHT)). A total of 622 events would yield a
90% power at a 2-sided type I error level of a 5 .05.
Assuming a 10% dropout rate, a total of 1696 patients
were required with a planned 2-year accrual period and a 4year maximum follow-up (median follow-up of 3 years).

igible and 228 were eventually randomized after a central
pathology review (Fig. 2). A total of 110 subjects were
randomized to receive immediate treatment (55 with HT
and 55 with CHT), whereas 118 were randomized to
deferred treatment (56 with CHT and 62 with HT).
Characteristics of the randomized cohort are shown in
Table 1. Reasons for screen failure (n 5 172) were not
captured. The most common reason for nonrandomization (n 5 171) was that subjects were determined to be at
low risk after the central pathology review (n 5 62). Additional reasons for nonrandomization are listed in the
CONSORT (Consolidated Standards Of Reporting
Trials) diagram shown in Figure 2. Ninety randomized
patients (39.5%) did not receive treatment. Reasons for
nontreatment are listed in the CONSORT diagram (Fig.
2). Although the current study was not designed to identify subjects who did not receive treatment because of the
absence of disease progression, it should be noted that 73
patients (32%) in the deferred group did not progress by
the end of the study and therefore were not treated.

developed disease progression (10 in the I(CHT) group
and 14 in the I(HT) group), whereas 17 of 118 patients in
the deferred group (14%) progressed (second progression)
(9 in the D(CHT) group and 8 in the D(HT) group)
(Table 2) (Fig. 3). One patient randomized to the I(HT)
arm developed bone metastasis; the remaining patients
demonstrated PSA progression only. The study was
underpowered to detect significant differences between
the study arms for all endpoints.
Safety

Of the 138 patients who received treatment, 118 (86%)
experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE) considered to
be possibly drug related. The majority of AEs were grade
1 or grade 2, and were similar to those observed when
either drug was given alone. Grade 3 and 4 AEs attributed to the study drugs were uncommon (reported to
occur in 21 patients). These occurred more frequently in
the group of patients who received chemotherapy, with
the most common AE being febrile neutropenia, occurring in 5 of 21 patients (23.8%).
Testosterone Recovery

Testosterone recovery kinetics were analyzed for those
patients completing an entire course of therapy (ie, 18
months of treatment) and with at least 1 posttreatment
testosterone value (n 5 108). Time to a testosterone level
>150 ng=dL and baseline testosterone recovery were analyzed given that this trial was designed under the
assumption that PSA disease recurrences would occur
within the context of full gonadal recovery. The median
posttreatment follow-up for that group was 676 days
(IQR, 478-847 days). The median time to testosterone
recovery to >150 ng=dL and baseline was 306 days
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 294-345 days) and
487 days (95% CI, 457-546 days), respectively. Ninety
patients (83%) and 64 patients (59%) had their testoster3614

one level recover to >150 ng=dL and to baseline, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences
in testosterone recovery between the treatment groups.
The time to baseline testosterone recovery in the combined chemotherapy (ie, I(CHT) and D(CHT)) and HT
arms (ie, I(HT) and D(HT)) was not statistically significantly different at 458 days (95% CI, 336-529 days) and
535 days (95% CI, 457-749 days), respectively (hazards
ratio, 1.4; P 5 .18) (Fig. 4).
Multivariable Cox hazard models were built to evaluate variables associated with recovery of testosterone to
baseline and to >150 ng=dL. Variables were selected based
on clinical relevance. Log transformation was applied to
baseline testosterone to reduce skewness. Two variables
were found to independently predict for increased time to
baseline testosterone recovery: age  65 years and logtransformed baseline testosterone. Three variables were
found to independently predict for time to testosterone recovery > 150 ng=dL: age  65 years, white race, and logtransformed baseline testosterone (Table 3). It should be
noted that individuals of nonwhite race only constituted
approximately 12.7% of the total randomized population.
Observed Versus Predicted FFP

Of the 228 patients randomized to treatment, only 205
had all the variable values to compute their predicted
FFP using the postoperative predictive probability model
developed by Kattan et al.5,21,22 One individual did not

individuals did not have their lymph nodes sampled by
the surgeon. These variables were all assumed to be negative for the purposes of stratification. Men in the
deferred groups (ie, D(HT) and D(CHT)) were the only
subjects not treated until the time of disease progression
after RP, and were the focus of our assessment of the predictive ability of the nomogram. The combined deferred
group’s predicted compared with observed FFP was significantly different (P < .00001). The concordance index
between the observed-to-predicted FFP for the combined
deferred group was 0.658. A calibration plot for the
combined deferred group is presented in Figure 5.
DISCUSSION
Surgical adjuvant prostate cancer trials face numerous
obstacles, including a lack of validated proximal endpoints, the need for long follow-up to capture meaningful
endpoints, a lack of consensus on the definition of highrisk disease, the most appropriate local treatment for
high-risk patients, the potential establishment of new

treatment standards during the course of the trial, and
long-term commitment for funding (Table 4). TAX3501 was designed to address the role of adjuvant=salvage
systemic HT and chemotherapy for patients considered to
have high-risk prostate cancer after RP. Unfortunately,
the study was terminated by the sponsor approximately
21 months after its activation due in part to early enrollment challenges. It is interesting to note that although the
rate of subject randomization for TAX-3501 was below
expectations, it was comparable to that during the early
stages of other multiinstitutional adjuvant trials.18,24-26 In
the end, TAX-3501 serves to outline these difficulties, and
raises serious doubts that future surgical adjuvant prostate
cancer trials can produce meaningful results.
PFS from the time of surgery to first (immediate
treatment arms) or second (deferred treatment arms) disease progression was the main endpoint. As anticipated,
PSA recurrences occurred in the vast majority of cases,
with 40 of 41 patients exhibiting PSA progression only.

did not allow us to examine the relationship between biochemical disease recurrence and more clinically meaningful objective endpoints. A major assumption in designing
this trial was that disease recurrence would occur within
the context of full gonadal function recovery (ie, a testosterone level  150 ng=dL), approximately 6 months after
the last administration of HT.27,28 It is interesting to note
that in the 108 patients who completed the 18-month
treatment period, only 64 (59%) recovered gonadal function to baseline after a median posttreatment follow-up of
676 days (IQR, 478-847 days). The median time to base3616

line serum testosterone recovery after treatment was longer
than anticipated at 487 days (95% CI, 457-546 days). A
more recent retrospective report in patients receiving combined HT (16 months of treatment) and primary radiotherapy also suggests longer times to recovery than initially
assumed on this study.29 Because PSA expression is
androgen-responsive, concomitant testosterone monitoring
after treatment discontinuation should be routine in all trials using PSA-based endpoints in patients with hormonesensitive disease. Studies evaluating extended courses of
HT will in turn necessitate relatively long follow-up times.
Prostate cancer has a variable clinical course, with
the OS in patients with biochemically disease recurrence
ranging from approximately 4 years to > 20 years.30-32
Several clinical and pathologic factors predict the outcome
of patients undergoing RP, and complex stratification
processes and large sample sizes are necessary to ensure the
balanced distribution of these factors between study
arms.33 TAX-3501 used a widely referenced postoperative
nomogram to define individual patients’ eligibility and to
stratify them based on their calculated risk of disease recurrence.5,21,22 We prospectively assessed the accuracy of
the nomogram in the group of patients randomized to initial observation. The nomogram predicted versus
observed disease recurrence rates for patients in the
deferred treatment arm suggest that the nomogram may
have overpredicted disease recurrences. Aside from possible issues with the nomogram itself, the most likely explanation for the difference in the predicted-to-observed FFP
was that the nomogram considered adjuvant therapy as
failure when it was constructed. The nomogram also did
not assume an undetectable PSA level 30 days after RP.
Because patients on the deferred treatment arms of this trial
were not allowed to receive adjuvant therapy, it may have
resulted in fewer anticipated events as defined by the nomogram. Because of limited patient numbers and relatively
short follow-up, these data cannot be used conclusively to
assess the validity of the nomogram. However, if disease
progression rates were underestimated, it remains possible
that even had TAX-3501 met its target enrollment and
follow-up time, it may still have been underpowered to
detect differences in its primary endpoint.
A broader issue that arose during the course of this
trial related to the emergence of new treatment

approaches, all of which directly competed with
TAX-3501. These included adjuvant radiotherapy in
high-risk patients, primary combined HT plus radiotherapy in patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk
disease, and neoadjuvant chemo-hormonal therapy.9,10,12,13,16,18,19,34-38 Table 5 illustrates the competitive landscape of clinical trials conducted in patients with
early-stage prostate cancer that affected TAX-3501 enrollment.11-16,18,24-26,37-39 Some of these trials led to new
standards of care that were not provided for in TAX3501. Adjuvant radiotherapy, an exclusion criteria in
TAX-3501, was perhaps the strongest argument cited by
various sites as a factor impeding enrollment.24,26,40,41
TAX-3501 was a carefully planned, surgical adjuvant
chemo-hormonal therapy trial. Enrollment difficulties
resulted in its premature termination by the sponsor; however, it does serve to highlight some of the key issues facing
adjuvant prostate cancer trials. The most frequently used
proximal endpoint in early prostate cancer trials, PSA progression, not only lacks clear clinical significance but is also
confounded by slow androgen recovery after prolonged HT.
Available nomograms may not be sufficient to prospectively
identify high-risk patients who are the most likely to benefit
from adjuvant treatment and, most importantly, given the
prolonged amount of time needed to complete adjuvant triCancer

als, an evolving treatment landscape will inevitably compete
for trial enrollment. TAX-3501 demonstrates the difficulty
in conducting surgical adjuvant prostate cancer trials, and
exemplifies why these trials may not be feasible.
