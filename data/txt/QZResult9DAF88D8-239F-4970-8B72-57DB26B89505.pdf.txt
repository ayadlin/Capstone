Abstract
Aberrant transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays an important role in the
development of cancer such as tumor metastasis and invasion. TGF-β-responsive gene
signature is highly activated in chemotherapy-treated triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC). Here, we investigated the effect of zerumbone (ZER) on TGF-β1 signaling
pathway and tumorigenecity of TNBC cells. Our results showed that the level of
TGF-β1 mRNA expression and cell invasiveness were higher in TNBC cells than in
non-TNBC cells. On the other hand, the cell motility of TNBC cells was completely
suppressed by LY2109761, a novel selective TGF-β receptor type I/II (TβRI/II) dual
inhibitor. In addition, FN and MMP-2 expression, which play an important role on cell
motility in various cancer cells, were dose-dependently decreased by LY2109761.
TGF-β1 increased FN, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in HCC1806 TNBC cells. TGFβ1-induced MMP-9 expression was decreased by both a MEK inhibitor, UO126, and
a smad3 inhibitor, SIS3. Induction of FN and MMP-2 by TGF-β1 was just decreased
by SIS3. Overexpression of smad3 significantly increased FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9
expression. Interestingly, ZER significantly suppressed TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP-2,
and MMP-9 expression in HCC1806 cells. In addition, ZER completely decreased TGFβ1-induced the phosphorylation of smad3. Finally, we observed that ZER suppressed
the tumorigenecity such as tumor volume, weight, Ki67 expression, and metastasis in
TNBC cells xenograft models. Taken together, we demonstrated that ZER suppresses
TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression through the inactivation of smad3
and inhibits the tumorigenecity of TNBC cells. Therefore, we suggest that ZER may
act as a promising drug for treatment of TNBC.

Introduction

and occurs more frequently in African American women
[4, 5]. In addition, TNBC is typically associated with
poor prognosis when compared with other breast cancer
subtypes [4-7]. Especially, highly recurrent rate of TNBC
is associated with aggressive phenotype, chemotherapy
resistance, and the lack of clinically therapeutic targets
[6, 8]. To date, no therapeutic agents have been clinically
approved for treatment of TNBC. Thus, many researchers
focus on the development of new therapeutic agents for
treatment of TNBC.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts
for 15% to 20% of breast cancers and is a heterogeneous
disease [1, 2]. TNBC are defined by their failure to express
the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
and human-epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)
proteins [3]. Of all subtypes of breast cancer, TNBC tends
to occur in younger age with pre-menopausal women

ZER completely abolished TGF-β1-induced smad3
phosphorylation and then, reduced TGF-β1-induced
FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression as well as the
tumorigenecity of TNBC cells.

Transforming growth factor-βs (TGF-β) are
multifunctional growth factors that play particularly
complex roles in the growth, progression, and metastatic
potential of cancers [9]. TGF-β1 is highly expressed in a
various cancers such as TNBC, prostate, and lung cancer
and leads to tumor promotion and metastasis [10, 11]. In
late-stage human tumors, the level of TGF-β1 expression
frequently increases and aberrant TGF-β1 expression
is associated with more aggressive tumors and poor
prognosis [10, 12]. One of several targeted strategies for
the treatment of patients with TNBC is the neutralization
of TGF-β [13]. Nam et al. reported that treatment of
mice with a monoclonal anti-TGF-β antibody strongly
suppresses development of either lung- or bone metastases
in 4T1 syngeneic mammary tumor models [13]. In
addition, induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) by TGF-β facilitates the invasiveness of breast
cancer cells [14-16].
FN is a large adhesive glycoprotein and plays
an important role on cell migration, invasion, and
differentiation [17]. FN augments human carcinoma cell
growth through upregulation of inflammatory factors
such as COX-2 and IL-8 in lung cancer cells [18, 19].
In addition, FN triggers MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression
which are involved with cell invasion and migration
through binding of RGD sequence of α5β1 integrin in
several human carcinoma cells, including breast cancer
cells [18, 19]. Aberrant MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression is
apparent in breast cancers and these proteins release often
associated with tumor invasion and metastasis [20].
Zerumbone (ZER) was first isolated from a
Southeast Asian ginger sesquiterpene and has a wide
range of pharmacologic effects, such as anti-inflammation,
antioxidant agent, and anti-carcinogenic agents in a variety
of tumor cells including breast, colon, and gastric cancer
[21-23]. We also reported that ZER suppresses IL-1βinduced cell invasion by inhibiting IL-8 expression and
MMP-3 expression in TNBC cells [24]. In addition, ZER
completely reduces angiogenesis through the inhibition
of NF-κB activity and NF-κB-dependent proangiogenic
genes such as VEGF and IL-8 [25, 26]. ZER inhibits cell
growth of various cancer cells through the induction of
apoptosis via the down-regulation of surviving and Bcl2
[21]. Abdelwahab et al. has suggested that ZER is a
promising chemotherapeutic agent through the cell cycle
of G2/M phase and the suppression of IL-6 secretion in
cervical and ovarian cancer cells [27].
In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect
of ZER on TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP9 expression in TNBC cells. We found that the level
of TGF-β1 expression was higher in TNBC than in
non-TNBC. The activation of smad3 by TGF-β1 was
closely associated with the induction of FN, MMP-2,
and MMP-9 expression. In contrast, blocking of smad3
significantly declined TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP-2,
and MMP-9 expression. We found for the first time that

Results
The level of TGF-β1 expression and cell invasion
is higher in TNBC than in non-TNBC
Elevated TGF-β1 is correlated with a high
incidence of distant metastasis of various tumor cells and
promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT),
ECM degradation, cell migration, cell invasion, and
angiogenesis [11, 28]. Thus, we investigated the level of
TGF-β1 mRNA expression between in non-TNBC cells
and in TNBC cells. Interestingly, our results showed that
TGF-β1 mRNA and protein expression was significantly
increased in TNBC cells compared with non-TNBC
cells (Figure 1A and 1B). The level of TGF-β1 mRNA
expression in MDA231 and Hs578T cells was significantly
increased by 9.0-fold and 20.2-fold of the level of ZR75-1
cells, respectively (Figure 1A). In addition, the levels of
FN and MMP-2 mRNA expression were also increased in
TNBC cells, although MMP-9 expression did not show
a sharp difference (Figure 1C). Especially, the levels of
FN and MMP-2 protein expression were significantly
increased in Hs578T cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, we
observed that the invasion capacity of TNBC cells also
was far superior to non-TNBC (Figure 1E). Therefore, we
demonstrated that the increasing amount of TGF-β1 may
be correlated with the invasion and migration of TNBC
cells.

The migration and invasion of TNBC cells is
suppressed by LY2109761 treatment
To verify the co-relation between TGF-β and
motility of TNBC cells, we treated with a dual TGF-β
receptor I/II inhibitor, LY2109761, for 24 h in Hs578T
and MDA231 cells. As expected, our results showed that
the migration of TNBC cells was significantly decreased
by LY2109761 in both Hs578T and MDA231 cells (Figure
2A). In addition, invasion capacity of TNBC cells was
also suppressed by LY2109761 treatment (Figure 2B).
In previous studies, highly expressed FN, MMP-2, and
MMP-9 trigger cell invasion and migration in several
human carcinoma cells, including breast cancer cells
[18, 19]. So, we investigated the level of FN, MMP-2,
and MMP-9 expression by LY2109761 in Hs578T cells.
Our result showed that the levels of FN and MMP-2
protein expression were decreased by LY2109761 in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C). Here, we cannot
detect endogenous MMP-9 expression of Hs578T cells

FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression is increased
by TGF-β1 treatment in a dose- and timedependent manner in HCC1806 breast cancer
cells

(data not shown). The levels of FN and MMP-2 mRNA
were decreased to 0.63 ± 0.07-fold and 0.33 ± 0.01-fold
of the control level, respectively, at 20 µM LY2109761
treatment (Figure 2D). Furthermore, we investigated
the effect of TGF-β receptor I (TGFBRI) and TGF-β
receptor II (TGFBRII) siRNA on FN, MMP-2, and
MMP-9 mRNA expression. As shown in supplement
Figure 1, the levels of FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 mRNA
expression were decreased by TGFBRI or TGFBRII
siRNA overexpression, respectively, in a cell-specifically.
Therefore, we demonstrated that elevated TGF-β
expression may increase the cell invasion and migration
through the induction of FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in
TNBC cells.

To investigate the regulatory mechanism of cell
invasion and migration by TGF-β1 in TNBC cells, we
chosen the HCC1806 triple negative breast cancer cells.
As shown in Figure 1A, the level of TGF-β1 mRNA
expression was relatively lower than other TNBC cells.
In addition, SUM159 and HCC1806 cells have been
known very high TGF-β sensitivity [29]. Thus, we treated
HCC1806 cells with TGF-β1 for the indicated dose and
time. The levels of FN, MMP-9, and MMP-2 protein
expression were dose- and time-dependently increased by
TGF-β1 (Figure 3A and 3B). In addition, we observed that
the activity of smad3 and ERK was significantly increased
by TGF-β1 (Figure 3C). Based on these results, we

± 3.2-fold of the control level), respectively (Figure 4B).
In addition, TGF-β1-induced MMP-2 mRNA expression
was decreased by SIS3 (0.24 ± 0.02-fold of the control
level) but not by UO126 (Figure 4C). Under the same
conditions, our results showed that TGF-β1-induced FN
and MMP-2 protein expressions were markedly decreased
by SIS3 treatment (Figure 4D). However, TGF-β1/ERK
signaling pathway was not affected on TGF-β1-induced
FN and MMP-2 protein expressions (Figure 4D). TGFβ1-induced MMP-9 protein expressions were decreased
by UO126 and SIS3 treatment, respectively (Figure 4D).
Here, we confirmed the effect of each inhibitor on TGFβ1-induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and smad3.
As expected, TGF-β1-induced the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 and smad3 was well abolished by UO126 and
SIS3, respectively (Figure 4E). Based on these results,
we demonstrated that TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP-2, and
MMP-9 expressions were regulated through the smad3dependent pathway in TNBC cells.

TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9
expression is decreased by smad3-dependent
pathway
To investigate the regulatory mechanism of TGFβ1-induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expressions, we
treated HCC1806 cells with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h
after pretreatment with UO126 (a MEK inhibitor) and
SIS3 (a smad3 inhibitor) for 30 min, respectively. To
assess the levels of FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 mRNA
and protein expression, we harvested the cell lysates
and culture media, respectively. As shown in Figure 4A,
TGF-β1-induced FN mRNA expression was decreased by
SIS3 (1.4 ± 0.05-fold of the control level). Induction of
MMP-9 mRNA by TGF-β1 also significantly decreased by
UO126 (11.5 ± 1.8-fold of the control level) and SIS3 (9.2

5E). The basal levels of FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 mRNA
expression were reduced to 0.18 ± 0.03-fold, 0.28± 0.04fold, and 0.35 0.02-fold of the control level at 20 µM ZER
treatment (Figure 5E). In addition, we examined the effect
of ZER on cell migration of HCC1806. As expected, we
observed that the migration rate of HCC1806 cells was
significantly decreased by ZER (Figure 5F). Therefore, we
suggested that ZER suppressed migration of TNBC cells
through the down-regulation of FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9.

To verify the effect of ZER on cell viability, FN,
MMP-2, and MMP-9 expressions, we treated HCC1806
cells with 10 and 20 µM ZER for 24 h, respectively. The
chemical structure of ZER was indicated in Figure 5A.
Our results showed that cell viability had no significant
change by 10 and 20 µM ZER treatment in TNBC (Figure
5B). However, we observed that ZER triggered the cell
cycle arrest at G2/M phase in HCC1806 cells (Figure
5C) whereas, cell cycle of MDA-MB231 cells did not
affect by ZER (data not shown). In previous study, Xian
et al. reported that ZER was sensitive to NB4 and U937
leukemic cells but resistant to MOLT4 and KT-1 leukemic
cells [30]. Therefore, we also suggested that HCC1806
cells were more sensitive to ZER than MDA-MB231 cells.
To investigate the effect of ZER on the basal level of
FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 mRNA expressions in HCC1806
cells, we treated with 10 and 20 µM ZER, respectively,
for 24 h. Our results showed that ZER decreased the
levels of FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 protein and mRNA
expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5D and

Next, we investigated whether ZER regulates TGFβ1-induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expressions. After
pretreatment with 10 and 20 M ZER for 16 h, HCC1806
cells with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h. We observed that
FN mRNA expression by TGF-β1 was increased by 11.6
± 1.5-fold of the control level (Figure 6A). In contrast,
TGF-β1-induced FN mRNA expression was suppressed to
1.5 ± 0.1-fold of the control level at 20 µM ZER treatment

(Figure 6A). Furthermore, TGF-β1-induced MMP-9 and
MMP-2 mRNA expression was completely decreased to
3.1 ± 1.3-fold and 0.76 ± 0.07-fold of the control level
at 20 µM ZER treatment, respectively (Figure 6B and
6C). As expected, our results also showed that TGF-β1induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 protein expressions
were abolished by ZER treatment in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 6D). Therefore, we demonstrated that
ZER downregulates the levels of FN, MMP-2, and MMP9 expression through the inhibition of TGF-β signaling
pathway in TNBC cells.
Next, we studied the effect of ZER on TGF-β1induced the phosphorylation of smad3 in HCC1806 breast
cancer cells. After pretreatment with 10 and 20 µM ZER
for 16 h, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1
for 30 min. Here, we observed that TGFβ1-induced the
phosphorylation of smad3 was completely suppressed by
20 µM ZER treatment (Figure 6E). However, TGFβ1induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 did not affect by
ZER treatment (Figure 6E).
To verify the alteration of FN, MMP-9, and MMP2 expression by smad3 overexpression, HCC1806 cells
were transfected with adenoviral vec (Ad-vec) and smad3
(Ad-smad3), respectively, for 48 h. As shown in Figure

6F, the levels of FN, MMP-9, and MMP-2 expression
were significantly increased by smad3 overexpression.
Therefore, we demonstrated that ZER may suppress TGFβ1-induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression through
the inhibition of smad3-dependent pathway in TNBC
cells.

ZER suppresses the growth and metastasis of
TNBC xenograft tumors
Next, we investigated the antitumor potential of ZER
in vivo via oral administration in an orthotopic xenografts
model using MDA-MB231-Luc cells. We injected MDA231-Luc cells (5 × 106 cell/100 µl) into the right secondary
mammary fat. In the orthotopic model, tumor volume was
suppressed by ZER treatment compared with vehicletreated mice (Figure 7A). In addition, mice treated with
20 mg/kg ZER (4.7 ± 2.8 × 109 photons/sec) developed
significantly smaller tumors than the control mice treated
with vehicle (70.4 ± 3.1 × 109 photons/sec) as measured
by in vivo luciferase activity (Figure 7B). We checked that
the tumor weight level of ZER treated mice (1.22 ± 0.35
g) also decreased in compared with vehicle treated mice

(2.56 ± 0.68 g) (Figure 7C). Finally, we further evaluated
the effect of ZER on the expression of Ki-67 which is
a marker of proliferation. As shown in Figure 7D, the
expression of Ki-67 was downregulated in ZER treated
mice as compared with vehicle treated mice. The positivity
of Ki-67 decreased to 37.5 ± 5.1% of the vehicle level
at 20 mg/kg ZER treatment (Figure 7D). In addition, we
observed that FN expression was significantly decreased
by ZER treated mice, although TGF-β1 expression did not
change (Supplement Figure 2). Finally, we investigated
the effect of ZER on metastasis using the 4T1 mammary
carcinoma cells which are highly tumorigenic and
invasive model. As shown in Supplement Figure 3A, we
observed that ZER completely suppressed the metastatic
potential of 4T1 cells xenograft tumors. Vehicle treated

mice manifested large metastatic nodules in the lung,
whereas these metastatic nodules significant decreased
in ZER treated mice (Supplement Figure 3A). Especially,
the number of metastatic nodules of ZER treated mice
(9.6 ± 2.7 nodules) also decreased in compared with
vehicle treated mice (27.1 ± 4.9 nodules) (Supplement
Figure 3B). Based on these results, we demonstrated that
ZER significantly suppresses the growth and metastatic
potential of TNBC xenograft tumors.

TGF-βs can modulate a variety of biological events
such as cell growth, extracellular matrix formation,
angiogenesis, and cancer progression [31, 32]. Plasma

levels of TGF-βs are elevated in patients with breast cancer
whereas after surgical removal of the primary tumor,
highly expressed TGF-β1 levels normalize in the majority
of patients [33, 34]. In addition, elevated TGF-β1 is
correlated with increased tumor invasiveness and disease
progression in a variety of tumors such as breast cancer
and colorectal cancer [34, 35]. TGF-β-responsive gene
signature is highly activated in chemotherapy-treated triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC) when compared to other
subtypes [29]. Consistent with these reports, we found
that the level of TGF-β1 expression and invasiveness is
higher in TNBC cells than in non-TNBC cells. On the
other hand, the motility of TNBC cells, including invasion
and migration is significantly decreased by LY2109761,
a novel selective TGF-β receptor type I/II (TβRI/II) dual
inhibitor. Therefore, we demonstrate that aberrant TGF-β1
expression directly or indirectly regulates the aggressive
and invasive properties of TNBC cells.
TGF-β1 is also regarded as a metastasis inducer and
promotes EMT associated the induction of various genes

such as FN and MMPs with increased tumor cell motility
[36, 37]. Increased FN expression level is associated
with tumor progression and poor prognoses in breast
cancer patients [38]. FN expression is closely involved
with the growth and/or metastasis of surrounding tumor
cells through the induction of EMT [39, 40]. We have
also reported that FN treatment significantly augmented
the rates of invasion and adhesion while FN-induced
cell invasion was suppressed by the FN inhibitor (RGD
tetrapeptide) in breast cancer cells [41]. Consistent with
these reports, we also found that basal level of FN is
augmented in TNBC cells. In contrast, highly expressed
FN level is decreased TGF-β receptor type I/II dual
inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner in Hs578T cells.
Therefore, we demonstrate that blocking of TGF-β1
signaling pathway by TGF-β receptor type I/II dual
inhibitors mediates the downregualtion of FN expression
and then may directly or indirectly affect the motility of
TNBC cells.
Although we could not fine the relationship between

FN and MMPs expression in recent study [41], secreted
FN enhances MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression through the
MAPK and the PI3-K/Akt-dependent pathways in breast
and ovarian cancer cells [19, 42]. Elevated expression
of MMP-2 or MMP-9 is associated with human cancer
invasion and metastasis [20]. In this study, we observed
that the invasiveness of TNBC cells is significantly
increased when compared to that of non-TNBC cells.
Especially, the level of MMP-2 mRNA expression is
higher in TNBC cells than in non-TNBC cells. On the
other hand, elevated MMP-2 expression was decreased
by TGF-β receptor type I/II dual inhibitors. Therefore, we
suggest that MMP-2 expression is also regulated through
the TGF-β dependent signalling pathway. In addition,
increased MMP-2 as well as TGF-β1-induced MMP-2 and
MMP-9 expression is associated with TNBC progression
and metastasis.
TGF-β1 can stimulate the motility of many cancer
cells such as prostate and breast cancer through in a
variety of signaling pathway [15, 28, 34]. The activation

of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) such as the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and
the p38 MAP kinase (p38 MAPK) in response to TGF-β1
triggers cellular migration and invasion [43]. Consistent
with these reports, our results showed that TGF-β1 induces
the activity of ERK and smad3 in HCC1806 TNBC
cells. Interestingly, TGF-β1-stimulated FN and MMP9 expression is suppressed by UO126 but not MMP-2.
However, the induction of FN, MMP-9 and MMP-2 by
TGF-β1 is suppressed by SIS3 treatment. Therefore, we
demonstrate that TGF-1/smad3 signaling pathway is
regarded as a metastatic modulator on the induction of FN,
MMP-9, and MMP-2 by TGF-β1 in TNBC cells.
Zerumbone (ZER), a sesquiterpene in subtropical
ginger, has been reported to inhibit tumor growth and
to induce apoptosis against a wide variety of tumor
cells, including colon cancer and leukemia cells [23,
30]. Murakami et al. reported that ZER suppresses
7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene- and TPA-induced
initiation and promotion of skin tumors [44]. Consistent

Human TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems

from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK).

with these reports, we observed that the tumorigenecity
of MDA-MB231 cells and the Ki67 positivity were also
decreased by ZER treatment. In addition, ZER inhibits
the de novo synthesis of iNOS and COX-2 through
the suppression of NF-κB and Iκ-Bα kinase activation
[21]. Recently, we reported that ZER abolishes CD44
expression through the inhibition of EGF/STAT-3 pathway
in breast cancer cells [45]. Furthermore, ZER significantly
decreased cell invasion of TNBC through the suppression
of IL-8 and MMP-3 expression [24]. In this study, we
found for the first time that ZER significantly suppresses
TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression
through the inhibition of smad3 phosphorylation.
Therefore, we demonstrate that ZER acts as a novel drug
for suppression of cell motility and tumor growth of
TNBC cells.
Here, we investigated the effect of ZER as a
therapeutic drug for treatment of TNBC. We found for
the first time that the levels of TGF-β1 mRNA expression
significantly increased in TNBC cells compared with
other subtypes. In addition, TNBC cells highly expressed
the invasion related genes, including FN, MMP-2, and
MMP-9 as well as the invasion rates is also significantly
increased in TNBC cells compared with other subtypes.
As expected, TGF-β receptor I/II inhibitor, LY2109761
significantly decreased not only the invasion and migration
of TNBC cells but also the level of FN and MMP-2
expression. Therefore, our data establish that aberrant
TGF-β1 expression influences the invasion and migration
of TNBC cells through the induction of FN, MMP-2, and
MMP-9. Interestingly, ZER dose-dependently suppressed
the levels of basal- and TGF-β1-induced FN, MMP2, and MMP-9 expression in HCC1806 TNBC cells
through the inhibition of smad3 activity. In addition, ZER
effectively suppresses the growth and metastatic potential
of TNBC xenograft tumors. So, we suggest that ZER
can be considered a promising targetable drug for TNBC
treatment.

Cell culture
MDA-MB231, and Hs578T human breast cancer
cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air
and 5% CO2 at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/
ml streptomycin. BT474, ZR75-1, SKBR3, and HCC1806
human breast cancer cells were grown in RPMI1640
media under the same conditions. Each cell line was
maintained in culture medium supplemented without FBS
for 24 h.

Treatment with ZER and specific inhibitors
Cells were maintained in culture medium without
FBS for 24 h, and then the culture media was replaced
with fresh media without FBS. Breast cancer cells were
pretreated with 10 or 20 µM concentrations of ZER for
16 h prior to the TGF-β1 treatment and then treated with
10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h. Furthermore, this experiments
involving specific inhibitors such as UO126 and SIS3,
was pretreated with specific inhibitors for 30 min prior to
treatment with TGF-β1 and then they were treated with
TGF-β1 for 24 h.

Cell cycle analysis

ELISA

Trypsinized cell pellets were resuspended in
1ml PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol for 20 min at room
temperature (RT). The fixed cells were centrifuged at
1,500 rpm for 5 min and washed twice in PBS. The cells
were resuspended in 1ml PBS with 100 µg/ml DNase-free
RNase A (Biopure, Canada) and then incubated for 30
min in a 37°C water bath. The cells were then collected
by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm and the cell pellets were
washed twice with PBS. The cell pellets were then
resuspended in PBS containing 50 µg/ml of propidium
iodide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and analyzed using
the FACS-vantage (Becton-Dickinson, San Diego, CA,
USA).

ELISA assays were performed on culture media
(400 µL) collected from BT474 and MDA231 breast
cancer cells. Protein levels of TGF-β1 was measured using
an ELISA kit for human TGF-β1 (Koma Biotech, Seoul,
Korea), according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
then using a microtiter plate reader, read the plate at 450
nm wavelength.

Wound healing assay
MDA231, Hs578T, and HCC1806 TNBC cells were
seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Then, the
TNBC cells were maintained in culture medium without
FBS for 16-24 h. The cell monolayer was scratched with
a 200-µL pipette tip to create a wound, which was washed
twice with PBS to remove the suspended cells. TNBC
cells were maintained with or without 10 µM LY2109761
for 24 h in serum-containing medium. The cells migrating
from the leading edge were photographed at 0 and 24 h
using a CK40 inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan). Cell to cell distance was analyzed average of
pixel number on three sites using Axiovision software
(Carlzeiss, Thornwood, NY).

Real-time PCR
The total RNA was extracted from the cells by using
the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated RNA samples
were then used for RT-PCR. Samples (1 µg of total RNA)
were reverse-transcribed into cDNA in 20 µl reaction
volumes using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit for RTPCR, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (MBI
Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA).
The gene expression was quantified by Real-Time
PCR using a SensiMix SYBR Kit (Bioline Ltd., London,
UK) and 100 ng of cDNA per reaction. The specific primer
sets used to detection of each gene mRNA expression
(Table 1). An annealing temperature of 60°C was used
for all of the primers. PCRs were performed in a standard
384-well plate format with an ABI 7900HT real-time PCR
detection system. For data analysis, the raw threshold
cycle (CT) value was first normalized to the housekeeping
gene for each sample to get the ΔCT. The normalized ΔCT
was then calibrated to the control cell samples to get the
ΔΔCT.

Cell invasion assay
Matrigel-coated filter inserts (8 µm pore size) that
fit into 24-well invasion chambers were obtained from
Becton-Dickinson. Breast cancer cells to be tested for
invasion were resuspended in culture medium (5 × 105
cells/well) and then added to the matrigel-coated upper
compartment of the invasion chamber in the presence
or absence of 20 µM ZER. Fresh culture media with 5%
FBS were added to the lower compartment of the invasion
chamber. The chambers were incubated at 37°C for 24
h. After incubation, the cells on the upper side of the
filter were removed using cotton swabs, and the bottom
filters were fixed in 100% methanol, washed in 1× PBS,

and stained using toluidine blue dye. Breast cancer cells
that invaded through the matrigel were located on the
underside of the filter. These cells were photographed
using a Scanscope XT apparatus (Aperio Technologies
Inc., CA, USA). The invasion rates were calculated by
averaging the total number of cells from four filters.

In order to establish a nude mice xenograft model,
we used 6- to 8-week-old female Balb/c nude mice (Orient
Bio, Korea), weighing about 18-22 g. Mice were kept in
pathogen-free animal housing in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals.
The firefly luciferase 2 (Luc2) and td Tomato (L2T)
fusion constructs were gifts of Dr. Sanjiv Sam Gambhir
(Stanford University, CA, USA) [46]. Stable MDAMB231-Luc cells were cultured and resuspended in
matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) to give
a final concentration of 5 × 106 cells/100 μL, which was
injected directly into the right secondary mammary fat.
The mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 5/
group), treated with vehicle (1 × PBS) or ZER (20 mg/
kg body weight in vehicle) by oral injection three times a
week for 28 days. The tumor size of the vehicle and the
ZER-treated mice was measured using digital calipers at
the set time point and the volume was measured using the
formula: V = 1/2 length × (width)2. Growth curves were
calculated using average relative tumor volume within
each group (vehicle or ZER-treated group) at the set time
points. Bioluminescent imaging analysis was done by
a Xenogen IVIS® Spectrum (PerkinElmer). Mice were
injected intraperitoneally with 100 μl of D-luciferin (10
mg/ml) in PBS, and after 10 min, imaged under anesthesia
with 2.5% isofluorane. Luminescence images were
captured as photons/sec/ROI (region of interest) minus
background luminescence for a similarly sized region.

Western blotting
The cell culture media (supernatants) and cell
lysates were used in the immunoblot analysis for FN,
ERK, smad3, and β-actin. The proteins were boiled
for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and then they
were electrophoresed in 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels,
respectively. The separated proteins were transferred to
PVDF membranes and the membranes were then blocked
with 10% skim milk in TBS with 0.01% Tween-20 for
15 min. The blots were incubated with anti-FN, ERK
(total and phospho-form), Akt (total and phospho-form),
and β-actin antibodies (1/1,000 dilution) in 1% TBS/T
buffer (0.01% Tween 20 in TBS) at 4°C overnight. The
blots were washed 3 times in TBS with 0.01% Tween 20
and they were subsequently incubated with anti-rabbit
peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1/2,000 dilution) in
TBS/T buffer. After 1 h incubation at room temperature
(RT), the blots were washed three times and ECL prime
reagents were used for development.

Zymography
Zymography was performed in 10% polyacrylamide
gels that had been cast in the presence of gelatin, as
described previously [42]. Briefly, samples (100 μl)
were resuspended in loading buffer, and run on a 10%
SDS-PAGE gel containing 0.5 mg/ml gelatin without
prior denaturation. After electrophoresis, the gels were
washed to remove SDS and incubated for 30 min at room
temperature (RT) in a renaturing buffer (50 mM Tris, 5
mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and 1% Triton X-100). Next,
the gels were incubated for 48 h at 37°C in a developing
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.8], 5 mM CaCl2, 0.15 M
NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). The gels were subsequently
stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250, destained in
30% methanol, and flooded with 10% acetic acid to detect
gelatinase secretion.

Immunohistochemical staining of MDA-MB231Luc cells xenograft tumor samples
MDA-MB231-Luc xenograft tumors harvested from
vehicle and ZER treated mice were fixed with formalin
and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were cut
and deparafinized in xylene, and dehydrated in graded
alcohol and hydrated in water. Tissue sections (4 µm)
were subjected to immunohistochemical staining using
Ki67 rabbit polyclonal (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), FN
rabbit monoclonal (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and TGF-β1
rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) by a
Bond-Max automated staining system (Leica). The Ki67
positivity of cells was analyzed using a Scanscope XT
from Aperio (Vista, CA).

Adenovirus transfer
The empty (Lac Z) and adenoviral human FLAGtagged smad3 cDNA were gifts of Dr. Seok Hee Park
(Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea). Recombinant
adenovirus expressing human smad3 was reproduced into
293A cells. The expression of this construct was confirmed
by western blotting.
