BACKGROUND. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are effective
cancer therapies, but they are reported to cause a rash in >50% of patients. In
the current study, the authors examined the use of tetracycline for rash prevention.

METHODS. This placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial enrolled patients who
had a rash at the time of enrollment. All patients were randomly assigned to
receive either tetracycline at a dose of 500 mg orally twice a day for 28 days versus a placebo. Patients were monitored for rash (through monthly physician
assessment and weekly patient-reported questionnaires), quality of life (using the
SKINDEX-16, a skin-specific quality of life index), and adverse events. Monitoring
occurred during the 4-week intervention and then for an additional 4 weeks. The

90% probability of detecting a 40% difference in incidence with a P value of .05
(2-sided).

RESULTS. A total of 61 evaluable patients were enrolled. The 2 treatment arms
were well balanced with regard to baseline characteristics, dropout rates, and
rates of discontinuation of the EGFR inhibitor. The incidence of rash was found
to be comparable across treatment arms. Physicians reported that 16 patients
treated with tetracycline (70%) and 22 patients treated with placebo (76%) developed a rash (P 5 .61). Tetracycline appears to have lessened the rash severity,

pidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are emerging as effective therapies for
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer, colorectal
cancer, pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer, and
other malignancies.1-4 These agents are well-tolerated, but a rash is reported to occur in >50% of treated cancer patients.1,4 Developing on the face, trunk,
and upper extremities, this rash is often acneiform in
appearance, mild in severity, and quick to resolve,
even with ongoing cancer therapy. However, more
severe or more persistent rashes also can occur, particularly with the administration of EGFR antibodies.4
How are these rashes typically managed? When
severe, cessation of the EGFR inhibitor is considered,
and in approximately 10% of patients these agents
do in fact need to be withdrawn.1 The rash then typically resolves, thereby allowing the uneventful reinstitution of cancer therapy, although persistent
rashes have been reported.5 This approach of withdrawing cancer therapy can be disquieting for
patients, especially in light of data that point to the
development of a rash as a surrogate marker for
improved survival.6 Anecdotal reports have also
described rash attenuation after the initiation of
other therapies, including systemic antibiotics such
as tetracycline.7,8 The latter is commonly used for
the treatment of acne, and the clinical similarity
between typical acne and an EGFR inhibitor-induced
skin rash suggests that this antibiotic might play a
role in preventing or treating these drug-induced
rashes.9-11 In addition, tetracycline carries antiinflammatory effects that also might help with rash
palliation.12
Despite such anecdotal reports, to our knowledge, no published placebo-controlled trial to datehas examined the role of tetracycline in preventing
rashes induced by EGFR inhibitors. In view of the
waxing and waning nature of these rashes and the
anxiety they evoke, it is important to begin to seek
rigorous evidence on the use of tetracycline for rash
prevention. Thus, the North Central Cancer Treat-

ment Group (NCCTG) conducted this placebo-controlled trial to test the role of tetracycline in the
prevention of rash in patients initiating cancer therapy with an EGFR inhibitor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overview
The NCCTG conducted this phase 3 trial. The Institutional Review Boards at each specific study site
approved the study protocol before patient enrollment. All patients provided a signed consent form
before participation.
Patient Eligibility
The following criteria were required before enrollment: 1) patient age 18 years; 2) cancer diagnosis;
3) initiation of an EGFR inhibitor (must have been
gefitinib, cetuximab, erlotinib, or 1 of the other investigational agents within this class of drugs) within 7
days of registration onto the current trial, either
before or after; 4) creatinine level 2 mg/dL and
total bilirubin level 2 mg/dL within 14 days of trial
registration; and 5) patient ability to take oral medications reliably and complete questionnaires with assistance if needed. Patients were not allowed to
enroll in this trial in the event of any 1 of the following: 1) previous allergic reaction to tetracycline or
1 of its derivatives, 2) use of tetracycline within 7
days of trial registration, 3) patient pregnant or
nursing or of child-bearing potential and unwilling
to employ contraception, 4) severe nausea or vomiting, 5) any rash at the time of study registration, or
6) history of a skin problem that the treating oncologist thought might ‘‘flare’’ during cancer therapy.
Pretreatment and Follow-up Evaluations
All patients underwent a history, physical examination, and assessment of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score within 14 days of trial
registration. A blood draw for a serum creatinine and
total bilirubin level was obtained at baseline.

Rash From EGFR Inhibitors/Jatoi et al

Patients were monitored for rash development,
quality of life, and adverse events. Patient-reported
assessment included: 1) a brief rash incidence questionnaire, 2) a previously validated SKINDEX-16
questionnaire relevant to rash development and its
implications,13 and 3) a questionnaire regarding
patient compliance with the EGFR inhibitor therapy.
These questionnaires were to be completed at baseline and weekly for 8 weeks after the initiation of tetracycline/placebo. Of note, the validated SKINDEX16 questionnaire provides a comprehensive patientreported skin assessment tool that includes 16 questions regarding itching, burning or stinging, skin
pain, skin irritation, and patient concerns and worries regarding a variety of other skin issues.
The patient’s treating oncologist was to perform
an evaluation at the end of 4 weeks and again at the
end of 8 weeks. This evaluation entailed a history
and physical examination; an assessment of patient
performance status; and an assessment of adverse
events, including gastrointestinal toxicity and rash
development, as per the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(version 3.0). These criteria indicated that a rash
involving <50 of the body surface area with symptoms was grade 2; that involving 50% of the body
surface area with symptoms was grade 3; and a more
generalized, exfoliative rash was grade 4. These evaluations were designed to detect rash development
during the 1-month tetracycline/placebo treatment
as well as the possible development of a rebound
rash between Weeks 5 and 8 after tetracycline/placebo was withdrawn. It should be noted that the protocol included a photograph of a patient with an
EGFR inhibitor-induced rash.

Treatment
Before randomization, patients were stratified
according to the following: 1) first-line cancer therapy versus other; 2) type of EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib
vs cetuximab vs other); and 3) corticosteroid use (yes
vs no). Thereafter, patients were randomly assigned
to receive tetracycline at a dose of 500 mg orally
twice a day for 4 weeks versus an identical placebo
at the same frequency. Because the primary endpoint
of the current study was rash prevention, it was
believed to be appropriate to continue tetracycline
for 4 weeks. The tetracycline/placebo intervention
was to be initiated within 7 days of trial enrollment.
Dosing was based on previous favorable results for
treating typical acne as well as anecdotal reports of
treating EGFR inhibitor-induced rashes with this antibiotic.10

The protocol specified that patients were to be
withdrawn from the tetracycline/placebo in the event
of grade 2 nausea and/or vomiting. The latter was
characterized by 2 to 5 episodes of nausea/vomiting
within 24 hours. Any other adverse events attributable
to the tetracycline/placebo were to prompt the treating oncologist to utilize his/her judgment regarding
whether to withdraw the tetracycline/placebo.
The protocol also clearly stated that all other
supportive care measures were allowed. The protocol
did not dictate any aspect of cancer therapy. Patients
were allowed to take antacids but were instructed
not to take them within 2 hours of the administration of the tetracycline/placebo.

Statistical Analyses
The primary objective of the current study was to
compare the incidence of rash between tetracyclinetreated and placebo-exposed patients. A sample size
of 30 patients per group provided a 90% probability
of detecting a difference in rash incidence of 40%
between the 2 study arms and of thereby rejecting
the null hypothesis of equal proportions with a P
value of .05 as a 2-sided test. Justification for seeking
this large effect size rests on the study team’s clinical
judgment that the inconvenience of taking an antibiotic twice daily over 1 month necessitated a sizable
improvement in rash incidence as a trade-off. Physician-reported and patient-reported incidence was
analyzed separately, and a Fisher exact test was used
to compare rates between the study arms. Other endpoints relevant to rash development included comparisons of rash severity between the study arms.
Averaged, maximal rash severity for each patient was
also compared by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test.
Analyses were performed with data gathered by the
4-week timepoint but, in the event of a rebound rash
effect after tetracycline was withdrawn, a similar
analysis was performed by 8 weeks.
Secondary endpoints included comparisons
across the study arms to assess changes in quality-oflife scores from baseline, as measured by the SKINDEX-16 questionnaire. SKINDEX-16 scores are presented as the median percentage from baseline, with a
higher percentage indicating a more clinically favorable score. The incidence of adverse events was compared across treatment arms with a Fisher exact test.
Separate analyses at the 4-week and 8-week timepoints were undertaken for the reasons alluded earlier.

RESULTS
Between February 2005 and July 2005, the target
accrual of 65 patients was met, and each patient was

randomly assigned to the appropriate study arm.
Subsequently, 4 patients received no study treatment,
leaving 61 evaluable patients (Fig. 1). The baseline
characteristics of the study group are listed in Table
1. The median age of the tetracycline-treated group
was 71 years (range, 40-84 years) and that of the placebo-exposed patients was 63 years (range, 49-84
years). Within the entire cohort, 38% of patients were

women. The 2 study arms were balanced with regard
to whether patients were receiving first-line cancer
therapy, the type of EGFR inhibitor prescribed, tumor
type, and whether cancer therapy was being administered with curative intent. It is interesting to note
that a slightly larger percentage of patients was
receiving cetuximab, an antibody to the EGFR, as
opposed to gefitinib, a small molecule inhibitor.

The time on study was comparable between the 2
study arms. The median time on study for patients
receiving tetracycline was 28 days (range, 3-82 days)
and that for patients on the placebo arm was 27 days
(range, 4-48 days) (P 5 .18). A few patients continued
to receive therapy beyond the 1-month treatment and
1-month monitoring periods because of breaks in
treatment. Reasons for treatment withdrawal among
tetracycline-treated and placebo-exposed patients
included the completion of study treatment in 62%
and 48% of patients, respectively; patient reluctance to
receive further study treatment in 7% and 21% of
patients, respectively; the development of an adverse
event that necessitated withdrawal from the study in

3% and 3% of patients, respectively; and other miscellaneous or unknown reasons in the remaining patients.
Compliance with the EGFR inhibitor was
assessed because it was acknowledged that stopping
the EGFR would also lead to rash prevention or resolution. Six patients, 3 on each study arm, stopped
receiving the EGFR inhibitor within the first month.
One tetracycline-treated patient stopped taking the
EGFR because of the development of a rash, and 2
placebo-exposed patients were withdrawn from the
study for the same reason.
The incidence of rash was found to be comparable across the study arms (Table 2). During the first
4 weeks, physicians reported that 16 tetracyclinetreated patients (70%) developed a rash, as did 22
placebo-exposed patients (76%) (P 5 .61). Between 5
to 8 weeks, when patients were no longer taking the
antibiotic/placebo, physicians reported that 13 tetracycline-treated patients (87%) and 16 patients who
received placebo (84%) had a rash (P 5 .84). Patientreported rates of rash development were found to be
similar. During the first 4 weeks, 15 tetracycline-treated patients (68%) reported a rash, as did 15 placebo-exposed patients (80%); (P 5 .35). Between
Weeks 5 to 8, when patients were no longer taking
the
antibiotic/placebo,
14
tetracycline-treated
patients (70%) reported a rash, whereas 15 placeboexposed patients also had a rash (94%); (P 5 .07).
Although one might argue in favor of a late trend in
tetracycline-treated patients, the small remaining
sample size coupled with a lack of statistically significant differences between the groups indicate that
tetracycline did not impact this study’s primary endpoint of rash incidence.
With regard to rash severity, a few indicators suggest that tetracycline may have carried a favorable
influence (Table 2). By Week 4, physician-reported
grade 2 rash occurred in 17% of tetracycline-treated
patients (n 5 4) and in 55% of placebo-exposed
patients (n 5 16) (P 5 0.04). However, by Week 8,

FIGURE 2. Serial SKINDEX-16 (a skin-specific quality of life index) scores
demonstrated a few favorable effects with tetracycline, including better itching scores by Week 4. In this figure, the y axis helps illustrate the percentage change in scores from baseline, and the x axis indicates time and the
number of patients being evaluated at each timepoint. The median percentage of baseline present at Week 4 was 83% in tetracycline-treated patients
and 50% in placebo-exposed patients, with the higher median percentage
being more favorable (P 5 .005).

when 44% of the cohort had dropped out, physicianreported grade 2 rash occurred in 20% of tetracyclinetreated patients and in 47% of placebo-exposed
patients (P 5 .5). It is interesting to note that the worst
physician-reported rash was grade 3 and occurred in
only 1 patient who was on the tetracycline arm.
In addition, patient-reported rash severity also
suggested slightly better outcomes among patients
treated with tetracycline, although a diminishing
sample size invites caution when interpreting the
current study results. There was no difference noted
with regard to patient-reported extent of rash during
Weeks 1 through 4. However, during Weeks 5 through
8, the few remaining patients described differing
rates of rash covering 51% to 75% of their body; no
tetracycline-treated patient was found to have a rash
to this extent, in contrast to 3 patients who received
placebo (19%) (P 5 .04).
The SKINDEX-16 questionnaire did not demonstrate uniform, statistically significant differences
across treatment arms, with a few notable exceptions. Serial answers to the question, ‘‘During the
past week, how often have you been bothered by
your skin itching?’’ revealed that the median percentage of baseline at Week 4 was 83% and 50%, respectively, in tetracycline-treated and placebo-exposed
patients (P 5 .005). It is interesting to note that the
higher median percentage is more favorable (Fig. 2).
Similarly statistically significant differences were
observed between the 2 treatment arms with regard
to changes in scores from baseline to 4 weeks in

skin irritation, and being bothered by a persistence/
recurrence of the skin condition. Again, these findings favored the tetracycline arm. In contrast, serial
answers to the question, ‘‘During the past week, how
often have you been bothered by being annoyed
about your skin?’’ revealed that tetracycline-treated
patients fared poorly by the end of the study. The
median percentage of baseline still present at Week 8
was 67% in the tetracycline arm and 100% in the placebo arm (P 5 .04), again with a lower median percentage being less favorable. In short, the SKINDEX16 suggested that tetracycline exerted positive effects
on quality of life in 4 questions, a negative effect in 1
question, and no statistically significant effects in the
remaining 11 questions.
Finally, as expected, tetracycline was well tolerated. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events noted between the 2 study
arms (Table 3.)

Rash From EGFR Inhibitors/Jatoi et al

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is 1 of the first
to move beyond anecdotal reports on to prevent
EGFR inhibitor-induced skin rashes and to seek rigorous justification for prescribing tetracycline in this
setting. Designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, this study sought as its primary
endpoint to determine whether tetracycline lowers
rash incidence. As prescribed herein, tetracycline did
not appear to decrease the incidence of rash compared with placebo. Therefore, prescribing this antibiotic to prevent an EGFR inhibitor-induced rash
cannot be clinically recommended based on these
data.
However, despite these negative findings, the
results of the current study did generate some highly
provocative, albeit preliminary, findings. A decrease
in the incidence of slightly more severe (grade 2)
rashes in patients assigned to the tetracycline arm
was noted. In addition, tetracycline-treated patients
reported other favorable effects, including less itching, less burning and stinging, and less skin irritation
compared with patients treated with placebo. Are
these data strong enough to justify prescribing tetracycline to all patients at risk for a highly bothersome
rash or only to patients who have already developed
such a rash? Although the current study did not provide the final answer to this fundamental question, a
few advisory remarks may be in order. In view of the
preliminary benefits noted in the reduction of rash
severity, the clinical acceptance of tetracycline in the
treatment of rashes, its favorable toxicity profile, and
the current lack of clinical data to dictate otherwise,
it appears that a clinician could not be faulted for
prescribing tetracycline to decrease the severity of a
rash. More importantly, we believe it is also important to move forward with clinical trials to determine
definitively whether tetracycline is truly indicated for
the treatment of rashes.
In view of the above, it is important to discuss 1
other aspect of this study. Since the initiation of this
trial, the clinical landscape of EGFR inhibitors has
changed. Cetuximab, an antibody to the EGFR, was
approved after the current trial had opened. After
accrual was completed, panitumumab was then
approved for clinical use. The notable tendency of
these agents to induce rashes might not have been
fully captured in the current study, in which only
35% to 40% of patients were receiving antibody therapy. Although rash occurred in >70% of patients in
the current study, the present-day incidence rate of
rash in clinical practice may in fact be higher with
the greater availability of antibody therapy. Thus,

853

there is a compelling need to continue to conduct
research on how best to prevent and palliate rashes
that occur from these agents.
Finally, a major strength of the current study
centers on its utilization of a quality-of-life assessment. To our knowledge, few studies to date have
sought to understand the implications of EGFR
inhibitor-induced skin rashes from the patient’s vantage point. By means of the SKINDEX-16, this trial
demonstrated that these rashes bother patients, who
must contend with itching, burning, and other types
of skin irritation. These troublesome symptoms also
provide a strong impetus for further research into
the palliation of this drug-induced rash.
