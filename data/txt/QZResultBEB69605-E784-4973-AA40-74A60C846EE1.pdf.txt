Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cell-cell signalling of semaphorin ligands through interaction with plexin receptors is important
for the homeostasis and morphogenesis of many tissues and is widely studied for its role in neural
connectivity, cancer, cell migration and immune responses1. SEMA4D and Sema6A exemplify
two diverse vertebrate, membrane-spanning semaphorin classes (4 and 6) that are capable of direct
signalling through members of the two largest plexin classes, B and A, respectively2,3. In the
absence of any structural information on the plexin ectodomain or its interaction with semaphorins
the extracellular specificity and mechanism controlling plexin signalling has remained unresolved.
Here we present crystal structures of cognate complexes of the semaphorin-binding regions of
plexins B1 and A2 with semaphorin ectodomains (human PLXNB11–2–SEMA4Decto and murine
PlxnA21–4–Sema6Aecto), plus unliganded structures of PlxnA21–4 and Sema6Aecto. These
structures, together with biophysical and cellular assays of wild-type and mutant proteins, reveal
that semaphorin dimers independently bind two plexin molecules and that signalling is critically
dependent on the avidity of the resulting bivalent 2:2 complex (monomeric semaphorin binds
plexin but fails to trigger signalling). In combination, our data favour a cell-cell signalling
mechanism involving semaphorin-stabilized plexin dimerization, possibly followed by clustering,
which is consistent with previous functional data. Furthermore, the shared generic architecture of
the complexes, formed through conserved contacts of the amino-terminal seven-bladed β-propeller
(sema) domains of both semaphorin and plexin, suggests that a common mode of interaction
triggers all semaphorin–plexin based signalling, while distinct insertions within or between blades
of the sema domains determine binding specificity.
Semaphorins are sub-divided into eight classes of cell-attached or secreted glycoproteins4,
characterized by an extracellular N-terminal sema domain followed by a cysteine rich PSI
(plexin, semaphorin, integrin) domain, which form homodimers through substantial sema–

sema domain interfaces5,6. Plexins are large type 1 single transmembrane-spanning cell
surface receptors (Fig. 1a) and are divided into four classes2,7. Sequence analyses indicate
an N-terminal sema domain, followed by a combination of three PSI domains and six IPT
domains (Ig domain shared by plexins and transcription factors). For class B plexins the
prototypic interaction of SEMA4D with PLXNB1 is implicated in migration and
proliferation of neuronal, endothelial and tumour cells as well as in angiogenesis and axonal
guidance8,9. Class 6 semaphorins (Sema6A, B, C and D) typically interact with class A
plexins; Sema6A–PlxnA2 signalling controls axon guidance in the hippocampus and granule
cell migration in the cerebellum3,10,11. A and B plexins have essentially identical
cytoplasmic structures comprising a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) topology with an
inserted Rho GTPase-binding domain (RBD)12,13. Various mechanisms have been proposed
for semaphorin-mediated activation of the plexin cytoplasmic region6,14–17 but molecular
level analyses of the effect of semaphorin-binding on plexin structure and oligomeric state
are necessary to provide the paradigm for semaphorin–plexin signalling.

We have determined crystal structures of the phylogenetically distant18 PLXNB11–2–
SEMA4Decto and PlxnA21–4–Sema6Aecto complexes and the unliganded states of
PlxnA21–4 and Sema6Aecto at 3.0, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively (see methods
and Fig. 1). The PlxnA21–4 sema domain forms a seven-bladed β-propeller, elaborated with
distinctive insertions more closely related to the Met receptor19,20 than to the semaphorins5,6
(see Supplementary Fig. 1), which is followed by a PSI domain (PSI-1), an IPT domain
(IPT-1) and a second PSI domain (PSI-2) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2) that together
form a stalk pointing away from the sema domain. The crystal packing provides no evidence
for oligomerization and PlxnA21–4 is monomeric in solution to concentrations of at least 29
μM (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 3). Unbound SEMA4Decto5 and Sema6Aecto form
dimers in the crystal and in solution (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4). The PlxnA21–4–
Sema6Aecto and PLXNB11–2–SEMA4Decto complexes are structurally similar. In both, the
semaphorins and plexins interact in a ‘head-to-head’ fashion through their sema domains
such that the semaphorin dimer brings together two plexin monomers to form a symmetric
2:2 complex (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Figs 2 and 4). Each of the plexins almost
exclusively interacts one-to-one with a separate semaphorin chain and the two plexins
diverge from the semaphorin dimer without interacting with each other. This architecture
positions semaphorin and plexin C termini in a trans (anti-parallel) arrangement suitable for
signalling between apposing cell surfaces.
Neither the semaphorin ectodomains of SEMA4Decto and Sema6Aecto nor the four domain
N-terminal portion of PlxnA21–4 undergo large conformational changes upon complex
formation (Supplementary Fig. 5). Superpositions of the bound and unbound sema domains
of SEMA4Decto, Sema6Aecto and PlxnA21–4 reveal no significant structural differences (Cα
atom root mean squared deviations (r.m.s.d.) of 0.85, 0.71 and 0.59 Å, respectively).
Conformational changes at the semaphorin–plexin interfaces are very limited
(Supplementary Fig. 5a), indicating that the binding surfaces are essentially preformed in
solution. Small differences in the orientation of the two subunits of the semaphorin dimer
are apparent on comparison of the unbound and bound crystal structures for both
SEMA4Decto and Sema6Aecto; however, there is no evidence for a re-orientation
characteristic of complex formation and the dimer interface remains predominantly
unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 5b). A similar low level of orientational flexibility is
observed in the linkage of the sema domains with semaphorin PSI and PlxnA21–4 PSI-1
domains (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c), as well as between the plexin IPT and PSI domains
(Supplementary Fig. 5c); however, PlxnA21–4 PSI-2 is disordered in the complex crystal.
Thus the semaphorin ectodomains appear to be relatively rigid structures, but full-length
plexins may be more flexible.

The representative semaphorin 4–plexin B and semaphorin 6–plexin A complexes have the
same overall shape, each of the four protein chains is located in a comparable position and
orientation and the interface is located at equivalent positions on the sema domains (Figs 1d
and 2), although the plexin adopts a slightly different orientation in the two complexes
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). The sema domains are highly conserved within the semaphorin
and plexin families both in structure (PLXNB11–2 and PlxnA21–4 r.m.s.d. of 1.64 Å for 390
equivalent Cα atoms; SEMA4Decto and Sema6Aecto r.m.s.d. of 1.73 Å r.m.s.d. for 427 Cα
pairs; see also Supplementary Figs 1 and 6b) and in overall charge distribution (semaphorins
positive and plexins negative; Fig. 2b). Furthermore, sequence alignments across the
respective families show conserved surface residues cluster at the complex interface
consistent with this mode of binding being common to all semaphorin–plexin interactions
(Fig. 2b).

A single semaphorin and plexin chain together form an extensive, slightly discontinuous
interface, burying 2,500 and 2,060 Å2 in the PLXNB11–2–SEMA4Decto and PlxnA21–4–
Sema6Aecto complexes, respectively, and comprising a mixture of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic (complementarily charged) patches (Fig. 2). Previous functional studies have
implicated the semaphorin and plexin sema domains in complex formation and
signalling2,21. The complex structures reveal that the same ‘edge on’ face of the β-propeller
is used for the interaction by both families of molecules (Fig. 2a). This interaction site is
predominantly formed by distinctive insertions in or between blades 1 to 5 of the
semaphorin and plexin sema domains, with very few residues contributing directly from the
blades of the standard β-propeller architecture (Supplementary Figs 2 and 4). The two most
prominent insertions, a ~20 residue loop between blades 1 and 2 (β1D-β2A) and a ~70
residue insert within blade 5 (first termed the extrusion in semaphorins5), are both present in
semaphorins and plexins but with different lengths and conformations (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Figs 2 and 4). These novel structural features interact in an anti-parallel
(trans) fashion (the semaphorin blade 1-2 loop with the plexin blade 5 insertion and vice
versa) leading to a twofold arrangement of the interacting sema domains. Finer-grained
differences in the interface-forming insertions (Supplementary Fig. 6c), particularly between
the plexins PLXNB11–2 and PlxnA21–4, seem sufficient to discriminate against non-cognate
complex formation.
The architecture of the complex, with a semaphorin dimer binding two plexin molecules
indicates that bivalency is likely to have an important role in semaphorin–plexin
interactions. Indeed a strong bivalency effect is observed in surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) equilibrium experiments for both the PLXNB11–2–SEMA4Decto and PlxnA21–4–
Sema6Aecto interaction (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7). Consistent with bivalency, when
plexin is coupled to the Biacore chip, the semaphorin–plexin interaction does not follow
simple 1:1 binding and the apparent affinity increases at higher plexin coupling densities due
to the greater potential for bivalent interaction (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7a, c)22. To
facilitate direct comparison with previously reported assays of semaphorin–plexin binding
affinities the SPR experiments were repeated with Fc-tagged dimerized Sema6Aecto
(Supplementary Fig. 7g) and, although it is difficult to reach an exclusively bivalent
interaction in SPR experiments22, apparent affinities of up to 15 nM were measured, close to
the nM values observed for cell-based assays with Fc-tagged semaphorins2,3. As expected,
the reversed interaction (soluble plexin binding to chip coupled semaphorin; only performed
for PlxnA21–4–Sema6Aecto) is monovalent (1:1 binding), with a greater than 40-fold
decrease in binding affinity (Kd = 2.3 μM), and independent of the density of semaphorin on
the chip (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7d). In order to dissect further the role of dimeric
semaphorin in the bivalent interaction the homodimer interface was disrupted by
mutagenesis to produce monomerized semaphorin (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 8). The
bivalent interaction observed for plexin-coupled chips is converted to a monovalent

interaction; the monomerized semaphorins giving Kd values of 5.5 μM for
SEMA4Decto(F244N/F246S) and 1.3 μM for Sema6Aecto(I322E) (Supplementary Fig. 7b, e)
which is similar to the reversed 1:1 interaction observed for both dimeric and monomerized
semaphorin-coupled chips (Supplementary Fig. 7d, f). Earlier studies have shown that
semaphorin dimers are necessary for activity21,23,24, possibly due to avidity. However, the
monomerized SEMA4Decto(F244N/F246S) is not capable of triggering the collapse response
in the well established COS cell-based assay25 even at a concentration ninefold above its Kd
for PLXNB1 (Fig. 3c, d), showing that 1:1 binding of semaphorin to plexin is not enough to
trigger signalling. Thus, semaphorin dimers facilitate bivalent interaction, necessary for
sufficiently tight binding to plexins and crucial for semaphorin–plexin-induced cell-cell
signalling.

Analyses of several semaphorin–plexin interface mutants (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figs 2
and 4) in SPR and cell collapse assays are consistent with the crystallographically
determined complex structures (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 9). Sema6Aecto mutant
L191R binds PlxnA21–4 5.5-fold weaker (Supplementary Fig. 9h). SEMA4Decto mutants
K100D/G101T and F181E/L182R and PlxnA21–4 mutants F221R and A396E all completely
abolish binding (Supplementary Fig. 9f, g), and the SEMA4Decto mutants do not collapse
COS-7 cells (Fig. 3d). A PlxnA2(A396E) mutant, expressed in COS-7 cells, has also been
reported to no longer bind Sema6A11. We further corroborated the interface by chargereversal at a conserved salt bridge in both complexes; PLXNB11–2(D139K)–
SEMA4Decto(K395D) (Supplementary Fig. 9c-e) and PlxnA21–4(D193K)–
Sema6Aecto(K393D) (Supplementary Fig. 9i–k). The semaphorin and plexin charge mutants
bind over 200-fold and 9-fold weaker to their wild-type counterparts respectively, whereas
binding is restored when the charge mutants are combined. Cerebellar granule cell migration
assays on 3T3 cells directly demonstrate that contact with cells expressing full-length
Sema6A reduces neuronal migration and that PlxnA2 is required for these neurons to
respond to Sema6A, as previously suggested from genetic data (Fig. 3e, f)3,11. Mice
harbouring the PlxnA2 A396E mutation have previously been shown to exhibit defects in
granule cell migration which are similar to PlxnA2−/− null mutant and Sema6A−/− mice11,
providing evidence in vivo for the importance of the Sema6A–PlxnA2 interaction defined
by our structural data. The extensive class 3 semaphorin–plexin A interactions are
distinctive in requiring members of the neuropilin family as co-receptors15. Previous studies
have implicated two regions of the Sema3A sequence in function, sema domain blade 3 (ref.
21) and a K108N mutant that abolishes signalling in vivo (but does not disrupt neuropilin-1
binding)26. Both features map to the semaphorin–plexin interface that we observe consistent
with direct Sema3–PlxnA interactions. Overall, the effects of semaphorin–plexin interface
mutants in vitro and in vivo support the structural data and show that this interface is likely
common to all semaphorin–plexin interactions.
In combination our above studies indicate that dimerization of the N-terminal domains of the
plexin extracellular segment, resulting from bivalent semaphorin binding, is prerequisite for
plexin signalling. After submission of this study, a similar architecture, and consequent role
for plexin dimerization in signalling, was reported based on crystal structures of complexes
of Sema7A and of a viral mimic with a sema-PSI fragment of PlxnC1 (ref. 27). We have, in
addition, carried out biophysical analyses of eight domain and full-length extracellular (ten
domain) constructs for PlxnA2 (PlxnA21–8 and PlxnA21–10) and of the entire cytoplasmic
region of plexin B1 (PLXNB1cyto) (Supplementary Fig. 10). Both PlxnA21–8 and
PlxnA21–10 show increasing evidence of intermolecular interactions at higher concentrations
consistent with the plexin ectodomain having some propensity for weak cis-interactions
through membrane proximal domains 5–10 before semaphorin binding. In isolation,
PLXNB1cyto remains monomeric at concentrations of at least 360 μM (Supplementary Fig.
10c) as shown previously at lower concentrations13. It has been reported that plexin

activation can be induced by concurrent binding of intracellular Rnd1 and cluster-inducing
antibodies16,28 and that semaphorin binding induces clustering of plexins15,16, possibly
preceded by a conformational change in the plexin14. Full-length transmembrane PLXNB1
has weak cis-interaction which is further enhanced by SEMA4D16. Furthermore covalently
oligomerized extracellular segment-deleted PLXNB1 is active independently of
SEMA4D16. Semaphorin-stabilized plexin dimerization may seed further oligomerization
through plexin-to-plexin cis interactions involving the membrane-proximal IPT domains or
through intracellular regions16,28 (Fig. 3g). We observe some inter-domain flexion for the
PlxnA21–4 IPT-1 and PSI-2 domains (Supplementary Fig. 5c) and additional flexibility may
exist in the complete plexin extracellular region, analogous to that observed for the
homologous Met receptor19,20,29, to enable plexins to undergo a conformational change14.
This change could expose cis interaction sites for extracellular clustering, providing an extra
level of regulation to tightly control the activity of semaphorin–plexin induced cell-cell
signalling.

Production of SEMA4Decto, PLXNB11–2, Sema6Aecto, PlxnA21–4, PlxnA21–8, PlxnA21–10 and
PLXNB1cyto

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Human PLXNB11–2, human SEMA4Decto, mouse PlxnA21–4, PlxnA21–8, PlxnA21–10 and
mouse Sema6Aecto (residues 20–535, 22–677, 35–703, 35–1040, 35–1231 and 19–571,
respectively) were cloned into the pHLsec vector30 in-frame with a C-terminal His-tag. For
crystallization experiments SEMA4Decto was produced in CHO lecR cells as described
previously5, PLXNB11–2 was expressed in HEK-293T cells30 in the presence of
kifunensine31 and Sema6Aecto and PlxnA21–4 were expressed in HEK-293S GnTI− cells32.
For all other experiments proteins were expressed in HEK-293T cells (without glycosylation
inhibitors) with the exception of Sema6Aecto and PlxnA21–4 that were expressed in
HEK-293S cells for MALS and AUC experiments. Proteins were purified from bufferexchanged medium by immobilized metal-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography.
SEMA4Decto, Sema6Aecto and PlxnA21–4 were purified individually, whereas after metalaffinity purification PLXNB11–2 was mixed with purified SEMA4Decto in a 2:1 ratio and the
complex was subsequently purified by size-exclusion chromatography. The full-length
intracellular domain of human PLXNB1 (residues 1511–2135; PLXNB1cyto) was cloned
into the pBac PAK9 vector (Clontech) in-frame with an N-terminal His-tag and used for
transfection of 2 ml Sf9 cells (1 × 106 cells ml−1). After five days the supernatant was
collected and three rounds of virus amplification, each with a 1:100 dilution were carried
out. For protein expression Sf9 cells with a density of 1.4 × 106 cells ml−1 were inoculated
with the virus from the third round of amplification (1:10). After 3 days the cells were
collected by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with protease
inhibitors. Cells were lysed by sonication. PLXNB1cyto was purified from cleared lysate by
immobilized metal-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography.
Crystallization and data collection
The PLXNB11–2–SEMA4Decto complex was concentrated to 8.0 mg ml−1 in 10 mM Tris,
pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. Sema6Aecto and PlxnA21–4 were concentrated to 13.1 mg ml−1
and 6.8 mg ml−1, respectively, both in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5 and 75 mM NaCl. Because we
were unable to obtain well diffracting crystals of the glycosylated PlxnA21–4–Sema6Aecto
complex both Sema6Aecto and PlxnA21–4 were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F1
(ref. 31) and mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 to a final concentration of 7.3 mg ml−1 before
crystallization. For crystallization of individual proteins Sema6Aecto and PlxnA21–4 were
not deglycosylated. Sitting drop vapour diffusion crystallization trials were set up using a
Cartesian Technologies pipetting robot and consisted of 100 nl protein solution and 100 nl

reservoir solution33. Crystallization plates were placed in a TAP Homebase storage vault
maintained at 18 °C and imaged via a Veeco visualization system34. The PLXNB11–2–
SEMA4Decto complex crystallized in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.0, 0.2 M calcium acetate, 6% v/v
glycerol, 20% w/v PEG3000, the Sema6Aecto–PlxnA21–4 complex in 0.12 M Mes, pH 6.0,
1% v/v ethyl acetate, 12.4% v/v 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, Sema6Aecto in 0.2 M diammonium hydrogen citrate, 6% w/v D-galactose, 20% w/v PEG3350, and PlxnA21–4 in
0.06 M HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.13 M magnesium chloride and 12.8% w/v PEG6000. Before
diffraction data collection crystals were soaked in mother liquor supplemented with glycerol
(25%, 15%, 20% and 20% v/v glycerol for PLXNB11–2–SEMA4Decto, PlxnA21–4–
Sema6Aecto, Sema6Aecto and PlxnA21–4, respectively) and subsequently flash-cooled in
liquid nitrogen or in a cryo nitrogen gas stream. Data were collected at 100 K at Diamond
beamline I03 (PLXNB11–2–SEMA4Decto, PlxnA21–4–Sema6Aecto and Sema6Aecto) and at
European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamline ID23-1 (PlxnA21–4). Diffraction
data were integrated and scaled with the HKL suite35 (PLXNB11–2–SEMA4Decto) or with
MOSFLM36 and SCALA37 in CCP438 (PlxnA21–4–Sema6Aecto, Sema6Aecto and
PlxnA21–4) (see Supplementary Table 1).
Structure determination and refinement

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

First we solved the structure of Sema6Aecto by molecular replacement in PHASER39 using
the structure of Sema3A6 (Protein DataBase (PDB) code 1Q47) as a search model. This
solution was subjected to one round of simulated annealing refinement in PHENIX40 and
subsequently re-built automatically by ARP/wARP41 and completed by manual rebuilding
in COOT42 and refinement in PHENIX. The structure of the PlxnA21–4–Sema6Aecto
complex was solved by molecular replacement in PHASER with the Sema6Aecto structure
and the Met-receptor structure20 (PDB code 2UZX) as search models, successively. This
partial model was re-built automatically by ARP/wARP and BUCCANEER43 and
completed by several cycles of manual rebuilding in COOT and refinement in PHENIX.
PlxnA2 domain PSI2 was omitted from the model due to disorder. Before manual rebuilding
a mask was constructed around the putative PlxnA21–4 molecule in the PlxnA21–4–
Sema6Aecto complex in CCP4, and the electron density inside the mask was used for
molecular replacement in PHASER to solve the PlxnA21–4 structure. Using this solution an
initial model was build automatically by ARP/wARP and completed by manual rebuilding
in COOT and refinement in PHENIX. The structure of the PLXNB11–2–SEMA4Decto
complex was solved by molecular replacement in PHASER with the SEMA4Decto structure5
(PDB code 1OLZ) and the PlxnA21–4 structure as search models, successively. This solution
was re-built automatically by BUCCANEER and completed by several cycles of manual
rebuilding in COOT and refinement in PHENIX and BUSTER44. Refinement statistics are
given in Supplementary Table 1. All models were validated with MOLPROBITY45.
Ramachandran statistics are as follows (favoured/disallowed (%)): PLXNB11–2–
SEMA4Decto 94.5/0.8, PlxnA21–4–Sema6Aecto 96.6/0.3, Sema6Aecto 96.3/0.1, PlxnA21–4
98.0/0.3. Superpositions were calculated using SHP46, electrostatics potentials were
generated using APBS47, alignments were calculated using ClustalW48 and buried surface
areas of protein–protein interactions were calculated using PISA49. Figures were produced
using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/), ESPRIPT50, ConSurf51 and Adobe Photoshop
(Adobe Systems) and Corel Draw (Corel Corporation).

overlapping PCR and cloned into the pHLsec mammalian expression vector, resulting in
protein constructs with a C-terminal His6 tag30, a C-terminal BirA recognition sequence for
biotinylation52 or a C-terminal Fc tag for covalent dimerization. All mutant proteins were
expressed in HEK-293T cells to ensure full glycosylation and were secreted at similar levels
to the wild-type proteins. The stringent quality control mechanisms specific to the
mammalian cell secretory pathway ensure that secreted proteins are correctly folded53.
Mutant proteins were used for SPR, cell collapse, AUC and MALS experiments.
Multi-angle light scattering
MALS experiments were performed during size exclusion chromatography on either an
analytical Superdex S200 10/30 column (GE Heathcare) or a TSK-Gel G3000SWXL
column (Tosoh) with online static light-scattering (DAWN HELEOS II, Wyatt Technology),
differential refractive index (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology) and Agilent 1200 UV
(Agilent Techologies) detectors. Proteins had previously been purified by size-exclusion
chromatography. Data were analysed using the ASTRA software package (Wyatt
Technology).
Analytical ultracentrifugation
Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using an Optima Xl-I analytical
ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Purified SEMA4Decto, Sema6Aecto and PlxnA21–4 samples at
different concentrations in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl were centrifuged in
double sector 12-mm centerpieces in a An-60 Ti rotor (Beckman) at 50,000 r.p.m. and 20
°C. Protein sedimentation was monitored by Rayleigh interference. Data were analysed
using SEDFIT54.

SPR equilibrium experiments were performed using a Biacore T100 machine (GE

20. All proteins were homogeneous with full biological activity and underwent gel filtration
in running buffer immediately before use. To mimic the native membrane insertion topology
proteins were enzymatically biotinylated at an engineered C-terminal tag and attached via
the biotin label to streptavidin that was covalently coupled to the surface52. To investigate
the bivalent effect of semaphorin dimer binding to plexin three different concentrations of
plexin were coupled to the surface22. The signal from experimental flow cells was corrected
by subtraction of a blank and reference signal from a mock coupled flow cell in Scrubber2
(BioLogic). In all experiments analysed, the experimental trace returned to baseline after a
regeneration step with 2 M MgCl2 (Supplementary Figs 7 and 9). Kd and maximum analyte
binding (Bmax) values were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting of a 1:1 Langmuir interaction
model (bound = Bmax/(Kd + C), where C is analyte concentration calculated as monomer) in
SigmaPlot (Systat). In experiments with plexin coupled to the surface and dimeric
semaphorins injected, binding did not fit well to a 1:1 model due to mixed bivalent and
monovalent interaction. Apparent Kd values calculated in these experiments are therefore
approximations. Nevertheless, apparent affinities of wild-type and mutant proteins
determined at equal plexin coupling concentrations can be compared relative to each other.
Functional cell collapse assay
Cellular collapse assays were performed essentially as described25. Briefly, COS-7 cells
were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected with human Plexin B1 carrying an Nterminal Flag-tag. Two days after transfection, cells were treated with medium containing
secreted wild-type or mutant SEMA4Decto and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the
cells were fixed and stained with anti-Flag primary antibody (Sigma) and Alexa 488-

labelled secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI
(Invitrogen) and cells were visualized with a TE2000U fluorescence microscope (Nikon)
equipped with an Orca CCD camera (Hamamatsu). Plexin B1-expressing cells were
classified as collapsed or non-collapsed on the basis of reduced surface area. Each
experiment was repeated twice and 2 × 200 cells were counted each time. Results are shown
as mean with error bars representing standard error of the mean.

Creation of NIH3T3 stably transfected cell lines
NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pEF-1-dTomato alone or together with pCAGGS-flagSemaphorin6A-full length. After three rounds of selection, the chosen clones for each line
were selected based on two criteria: (1) the co-expression of both genes, (2) the proper
targeting of Semaphorin6A to the plasma membrane. Both criteria were tested by
fluorescent techniques using monoclonal antibody against the flag tag (clone M2, Sigma).
Explant cultures
C57/BL6 mice at postnatal day 5 (P5) were used from wild-type and Plexin-A2 knock-out
(PA2 KO) mice models. Animals were sacrificed according to the Irish Department of
Agriculture and European Ethical and Animal Welfare regulations. Cerebella were dissected
out and sliced to get 200 μm cerebellum cortex slices. The external granular layer (EGL)
was isolated from the cerebellar cortex and cut into 200–500 μm tissue pieces. EGL
explants were cultured onto NIH3T3 monolayer cell lines stably transfected with different
genes (dTomato, Flag–Semaphorin6A/dTomato). Co-cultures were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with L-glutamine, D-glucose, fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 3 M KCl, for 4 days in 5% CO2, 95% humidity incubator at 37 °C.

Co-cultures were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h. After several rinses with PBS, cultures were
incubated with the monoclonal antibody against NeuN transcription factor (1:200, clone
A60, Millipore) to mark the cell bodies of the post-mitotic cerebellar neurons. Secondary
antibody conjugated to Alexa488 was used for further analysis in fluorescent microscopes.
Analysis and quantification
Immunostained co-cultures were examined on a Zeiss LSM-700 microscope. All the
migrating post-mitotic cell bodies were counted as well as the explant area measured from
each single co-culture picture using ImageJ image analysis software. Migration data were
normalized as number of migrating cells for 100 μm2 of explant area, and expressed as
mean ± s.e.m. For each experimental condition 50–100 explants were used. Student’s t-test
was chosen for further statistical analysis.

signalling. Binding of semaphorin stabilizes plexin dimerization, sufficient plexin
ectodomain flexibility may enable plexin-to-plexin cis interaction in their membraneproximal regions (upper panel) and seed further oligomerization. Possibly, dimerization is
preceded by a ‘switch-blade’ conformational change in the plexin ectodomain (lower panel)
exposing cis interaction sites leading to extracellular clustering. Two types of initial binding
events (dotted enclosures) could result in the dimer and cluster architecture of either the
upper or lower panel. The precise arrangement of the cytoplasmic region in the active state
triggered by extracellular clustering cannot be specified.
