ABSTRACT
Recent data suggest that SRC family kinases (SFKs) could represent potential
therapeutic targets for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft-tissue
sarcoma in children. Here, we assessed the effect of a recently developed selective
SFK inhibitor (a pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative, called SI221) on RMS cell lines.
SI221, which showed to be mainly effective against the SFK member YES, significantly
reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis, without affecting non-tumor cells, such
as primary human skin fibroblasts and differentiated C2C12 cells. Moreover, SI221
decreased in vitro cell migration and invasion and reduced tumor growth in a RMS
xenograft model. SFK inhibition also induced muscle differentiation in RMS cells by
affecting the NOTCH3 receptor-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) axis,
which regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation. Overall, our
findings suggest that SFK inhibition, besides reducing RMS cell growth and invasive
potential, could also represent a differentiation therapeutic strategy for RMS.

approximately two thirds of cases [1, 3]. ERMS most
commonly occurs in the head and neck region and genitourinary tract of younger children (1–14 years), whereas
ARMS occurs more frequently in the extremities and trunk
region of older children and adolescents [1, 3].
Over the last decades, significant progresses
have been made in RMS therapy through the use of
chemotherapy in association with surgery and radiation
therapy as adjunct treatments. Indeed, in patients with
low-grade, localized ERMS, the five-year survival rate is
> 85% [3]. Nevertheless, this rate decreases with increased

INTRODUCTION
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common
soft-tissue sarcoma in children. This highly malignant
tumor has traditionally been considered to arise from
committed skeletal muscle precursor cells that fail to
differentiate [1], although some RMSs develop in organs
lacking a skeletal muscle component [2, 3].
RMS is classified into two major subtypes:
embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS) RMS, the
first being the most common type, accounting for

age and tumor stage. ARMS is more aggressive than
ERMS, showing a poorer response to therapy and a worse
prognosis, with a five-year survival rate of approximately
50%, which dramatically decreases to 10–30% for
metastatic ARMS [4]. Moreover, since RMS primarily
affects children and adolescents, there are concerns about
long-term adverse effects of the treatment, which might
cause growth and developmental problems and increase
the risk of secondary cancers [3].
Therefore, the development of more selective
targeted therapies against RMS is an urgent need.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to
RMS onset and progression is essential to identify
rational therapeutic strategies. RMS is thought to arise as
a consequence of multiple defects leading to a disrupted
balance between the mutually exclusive and strictly
coordinated proliferation and myogenic differentiation
processes [1, 3]. The most common alteration detected
in ERMS is loss of heterozygosity on the short arm
of chromosome 11 (11p15.5), whereas ARMS is
characterized by the t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation in
approximately 70% of cases and by the t(1;13)(p36;q14)
translocation in approximately 10% of cases, which
generate PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins,
respectively [2, 3]. However, many other molecular
alterations in cell cycle and differentiation pathways have
been identified [1, 3–5].
Hyperactivation of the SRC family kinases (SFKs)
has been observed in many human cancers. These kinases
are considered attractive targets in cancer therapy because
of their central role in controlling cell proliferation,
apoptosis, angiogenesis and invasion [6]. Recent data
show that SFKs are hyperactivated also in RMS cell lines
[7, 8] and, consistently, SFK inhibition, mediated by the
multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib, induces
an antiproliferative effect on RMS cell lines, both in vitro
and in xenotrasplanted mice [8], and a reduction in cell
migration [7]. These observations suggest that SFKs could
represent therapeutic targets also for RMS.
We recently synthesized new pyrazolo[3,4-d]
pyrimidine derivative SFK inhibitors, binding the ATP
pocket of SFKs, which proved to be good antiproliferative
and proapoptotic agents in several tumor types [9–12].
Here, we focused on one of these new SFK inhibitors, the
SI221 compound, which was able to reduce cell viability
in both ERMS and ARMS cell lines, without significantly
affecting non-tumor cells. SI221 also decreased RMS cell
migration and invasion in vitro and reduced tumor growth
in xenotrasplanted mice. Interestingly, a kinase activity
screening assay showed that SI221 is mainly effective
against the SFK member YES, which has recently been
identified as an important player in RMS development [8].
Moreover, our data suggest that SFK inhibition through
SI221 could rescue the differentiation program in RMS
cells (evaluated by both myogenic marker expression
and cell morphology) by inhibiting NOTCH3 receptor,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which hinders muscle differentiation, and activating
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which
promotes differentiation.

RESULTS
Cytotoxic effect of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine
SFK inhibitors on RMS cell lines
Before testing our SFK inhibitors, we analyzed the
expression of the active form of SFKs (phospho-SFKs)
and total levels of SFK members (SRC, YES, FGR, FYN,
HCK, LYN, BLK and LCK) in two RMS cell lines (RD
and RH30, representing the ERMS and ARMS subtypes,
respectively) and in non-neoplastic cells (primary human
skin fibroblasts) for comparison. Both RMS cell lines
expressed the active phosphorylated form of SFKs, which
were almost undetectable in fibroblasts (Figure 1A). Total
SRC, YES, FGR, FYN, HCK, LYN and BLK were all
expressed in all the cell lines (Figure 1A), whereas LCK
was not expressed (data not shown).
We then treated the RMS cell lines with a panel
of new pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine SFK inhibitors at
concentrations ranging from 1 to 15 μM for 72 hours and
evaluated cell viability by MTS assay. To rule out possible
cytotoxic effects of these molecules on non-neoplastic
cells, our SFK inhibitors were also tested on fibroblasts
and a mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12, which represent
a well-established model to recapitulate skeletal muscle
differentiation. C2C12 cells were grown in differentiation
medium (DM) for 9 days to obtain cells mimicking the
non-tumor muscle counterpart. We observed significant
cytotoxic effects on RMS cell lines with all the molecules
tested (data not shown). We focused in particular on one
compound, SI221 (Figure 1B), which resulted effective on
both RMS cell lines and showed low or no toxicity on
differentiated C2C12 cells and fibroblasts, respectively, at
the concentrations tested (Figure 1C).
To assay SI221 selectivity towards the various SFK
members, we tested this small molecule against a panel
of 29 different kinases, including 8 SFKs. The results
demonstrated that SI221 specifically inhibits the kinase
activity of SFK members, without significantly affecting
the activity of the other kinases included in the panel
(Supplementary Table 1). In particular, SI221 showed
to be mainly effective against the SFK member YES,
which seems to have an oncogenic role in both ERMS
and ARMS [8].
We also compared by MTS the cytotoxic effect of
our compound with that of the well-known SFK inhibitor
PP2, which showed an efficacy lower than or similar to
that of SI221 on RD and RH30 cells, with a half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 19.12 μM and 3.79 μM,
respectively (Supplementary Figure 1).
To verify that SI221 inhibits SFK activation in
RMS cell lines, we evaluated the expression of the active

phosphorylated form of SFKs 72 hours after treatment
with SI221 at its IC50 values (indicated in Figure 1D).
As expected, the molecule caused a strong decrease in
phospho-SFK level (Figure 1E).
The observation that SI221 was cytotoxic to
RMS cells expressing the active form of SFKs and
not to fibroblasts, in which active SFKs were almost

undetectable, seems to confirm SI221 specificity towards
active SFKs. To verify further that SI221 effectiveness is
dependent on the activation status of SFKs, we analyzed
the expression of the active form of SFKs also in C2C12
cells. We observed that SI221 cytotoxicity to C2C12
cells varied according to changes in the activation status
of SFKs during differentiation. Indeed, consistent with
12423

Oncotarget

a previous paper [13], SFK activation decreased during
C2C12 differentiation (Figure 1F), which was evaluated by
both myosin expression (Figure 1F) and cell morphology
(Figure 1G), and SI221 effectiveness decreased accordingly.
In particular, SI221 was effective on C2C12 cells still
expressing high levels of the active form of SFKs after
5 days in DM (IC50: 4.5 μM), whereas it caused only a
low toxicity on C2C12 cells grown in DM for 9 days and
expressing a low level of active SFKs (IC50: 24.2 μM).

To evaluate SI221 ability to induce apoptosis in
RD and RH30 cell lines, we analyzed cell staining with
annexin V-FITC and PI by FACS 72 hours after treatment
with SI221 at its IC50 values. Analyses of early and late
apoptosis showed that SI221 was able to induce apoptosis
in both the cell lines (Figure 2A). Consistently, we
observed a significant increase in caspase-3 activity in RD
and RH30 cells 72 hours after treatment with SI221 at its
IC50 values (Figure 2B).

SFK inhibition on RMS cells was due to cell cycle arrest or
to cell death, we analyzed by FACS the cell cycle profile of
RD and RH30 cell lines 72 hours after treatment with SI221
at its IC50 values. We did not find significant effects of this
SFK inhibitor on cell cycle distribution (data not shown).

In order to analyze the effect of SFK inhibition on
RMS cell motility, RD and RH30 cell lines were treated
with SI221 at its IC50 values (as previously calculated 72
hours after treatment) and cell migration was evaluated 24
hours after treatment by the scratch assay. We observed
a sharp decrease in cell migration in both RMS cell

lines (Figure 3A). In particular, in RD and RH30 control
cells treated with DMSO a complete wound healing was
observed, whereas in SI221 treated cell lines only a few
cells migrated into the scratch. We ascertained that the
number of viable cells was not significantly affected after
24 hours of SI221 treatment by trypan blue staining of RD
and RH30 cells identically treated in parallel experiments
(data not shown).
By using modified Boyden chambers with a
Matrigel-coated filter, we also evaluated the effect of
SI221 on the invasive potential of the RH30 cell line,
which is representative of the most aggressive and
invasive histotype [4, 14, 15]. We observed a significant
decrease in cell invasion 24 hours after treatment with
SI221 at its 72-hour IC50 value (Figure 3B and 3C). The
number of viable cells was not significantly affected after
24 hours of treatment with SI221, as verified by trypan
blue staining of RH30 cells identically treated in parallel
experiments (data not shown).

Recent data indicate that SFK inhibition is able
to induce muscle differentiation in C2C12 cells [13].
Considering that RMS arises from committed skeletal
muscle precursor cells that fail to differentiate and that
promoting RMS differentiation is a recognized strategy
to suppress the transformed phenotype [3], we set out to
analyze whether SFK inhibition could be able to restore
the differentiation program of RMS cells.
We first analyzed the morphological features of RD
and RH30 cells, both unstained and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin, 6 days after treatment with SI221 at its IC50
values. We observed marked changes in the morphology of
the cells, which became larger, flatter and multinucleated
(Figure 4A). These morphological changes seemed to be
indicative of multinucleated myotube formation.

control cells were evaluated by Student t test and indicated with *: significant (P < 0.05). (C) Representative micrographs of RH30 cells

To confirm the induction of myogenic differentiation,
we analyzed the expression of myogenic markers. First,
we analyzed the expression of the MYOG gene (encoding
myogenin) by real-time quantitative Reverse TranscriptionPCR (qRT-PCR) after 3, 4, 5 and 6 days of treatment
with SI221 at its IC50 values. We observed an increase in
MYOG expression in both RD and RH30 cell lines 5 days
after treatment (Figure 4B). This rise in MYOG expression
decreased on day 6. Consistently, an increase in myogenin
expression was also observed by western blotting 5 and/or 6
days after treatment in the two cell lines (Figure 4C).
We also analyzed the expression of the skeletal
muscle MYH2 gene (encoding myosin heavy chain 2) in
RD and RH30 cell lines by real-time qRT-PCR 3, 4, 5 and
6 days after treatment with SI221 at its IC50 values. An
increase in MYH2 expression was evident 5 days after
treatment and further raised after 6 days in RD cells,
whereas in RH30 cells we observed an increase in MYH2
only 6 days after treatment (Figure 4B). Consistently, by
immunofluorescence analysis we also observed a sharp
increase in myosin heavy chain in both RD and RH30
cells 6 days after treatment with SI221 (Figure 4D).
Therefore, our data indicate that SFK inhibition is indeed
able to induce RMS cell differentiation.

differentiation [20], we analyzed the effect of SI221 on
p38 MAPK activation in RMS cell lines. As expected,
we observed an increase in the active phosphorylated
form of p38 MAPK in both RMS cell lines 72 hours after
treatment with SI221 at its IC50 values (Figure 5B).
These data suggest that SI221 likely triggers the
recovery of the differentiation program in RMS cells
by decreasing cleaved NOTCH3, which inhibits muscle
differentiation, and increasing the active form of p38
MAPK, which promotes differentiation.
A possible functional link between the SFK inhibitioninduced NOTCH3 downregulation and p38 MAPK
activation observed in RMS cells is provided by a study
reporting that NOTCH signaling is able to suppress the
activity of p38 MAPK in C2C12 cells [21]. Consistently,
NOTCH3 inhibition by RNA interference activates p38
MAPK in RMS cell lines [19]. Therefore, in order to
evaluate whether the observed SI221-induced increase in
phospho-p38 MAPK was dependent on SI221 ability to
decrease NOTCH3, we transiently transfected the RH30
cells to induce mild levels of the constitutively active
intracellular form of NOTCH3 and analyzed the expression
of phospho-p38 MAPK after 72 hours of treatment with
SI221. As a consequence of SI221 inability to inhibit the
constitutively active form of NOTCH3, SI221 was no longer
able to increase significantly phospho-p38 MAPK levels
(Figure 5C). However, although SI221 was not able to inhibit
the transfected constitutively active form of NOTCH3,
the compound was still able to inhibit the endogenous
NOTCH3, thus explaining the observed slight decrease
in total NOTCH3 after SI221 treatment. As expected, in
cells transfected with a control empty vector, SI221 was
confirmed to be able to strongly inhibit NOTCH3 and
increase markedly phospho-p38 MAPK. Therefore, our data
indicate that SI221 ability to trigger p38 MAPK activation
was a consequence of its inhibitory action on NOTCH3.

SFK inhibition hinders an SFK-NOTCH3-p38
MAPK axis in RMS cell lines
In order to understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying the SFK inhibition-induced RMS cell
differentiation, we analyzed the effects of SFK
inhibition on the expression of differentiation regulators
in RMS cells.
Recent data implicated SFKs in the NOTCH
pathway, showing that SFK inhibition decreased the
active cleaved form of NOTCH1 in pancreatic cancer
cells [16]. This is particularly intriguing because
NOTCH signaling is involved in RMS development.
Indeed, NOTCH signaling is upregulated in RMS
and its inhibition reduces RMS cell proliferation and
invasion and promotes differentiation [15, 17–19]. In
particular, among NOTCH family members, NOTCH1
seems to play a role in hindering differentiation in
RD cells but not in RH30 cells, NOTCH3 has a role
in inhibiting differentiation in both RD and RH30
cells, whereas NOTCH2 seems not to be involved in
differentiation inhibition in RMS cells and NOTCH4
is undetectable in these cells [19]. Therefore, we
investigated the effect of SI221 on NOTCH3 expression
and found that SI221, at its IC50 values, decreased the
cleaved form of NOTCH3 in both RD and RH30 cell
lines 72 hours after treatment (Figure 5A).
Recent findings also show that SFK inhibition
is able to induce muscle differentiation in C2C12 cells
through p38 MAPK activation [13]. Since p38 MAPK is
impaired in RMS cells and its activation can induce RMS

Pharmacological inactivation of p38 MAPK
prevents the SFK inhibitor-induced RMS cell
differentiation
To verify whether p38 MAPK activation is indeed
required for the differentiation program triggered by SFK
inhibition in RMS cells, we treated RD and RH30 cell lines
with 10 μM SB203580, a well-known p38 MAPK inhibitor,
both alone and in combination with SI221 at its IC50
values for 6 days. As expected, p38 MAPK inactivation
inhibited the SI221-induced muscle differentiation, as
shown by both cell morphology (Figure 6A) and myogenin
and myosin expression (Figure 6B and 6C).

times a week per os. Tumor volumes were measured 10,
20, 30 and 40 days after treatment. Our results showed that
SI221 treatment significantly reduced the growth rate of
RD xenografts (Figure 7A). Consistently, analysis of tumor
weights excised from mice at the end of the study period
showed that the mean tumor weight was significantly lower
in SI221-treated mice than in control mice (Figure 7B).

metastatic disease and high risk features still face a poor
prognosis and, considering that RMS primarily affects
young patients, there are concerns about long-term adverse
effects of the treatment [1, 3]. Therefore, the development
of more selective targeted therapies against RMS is an
urgent need.
It has recently been shown that SFK hyperactivation
could play a role in RMS development [7, 8]. Inhibition
of SFKs, whose aberrant activation is implicated in
the onset and progression of many human cancers, is
considered one of the most promising strategies for
cancer therapy [6]. In RMS cell lines, dasatinib-mediated
SFK inhibition induced an antiproliferative effect both
in vivo and in vitro [8] and a reduction in cell migration
[7], thus suggesting that SFKs could represent therapeutic
targets also for RMS.
In the present study, we challenged two RMS
cell lines (the RD and RH30 cells, representing the

Over the last decades, many efforts have been
devoted to improve therapeutic options for RMS, leading
to the development of a multimodality therapy, consisting
of systemic chemotherapy in combination with surgery
and radiation therapy, which has determined a significant

phosphorylated form of SFKs and, as expected, caused
a strong decrease in phospho-SFK levels, whereas it
was ineffective on fibroblasts, in which the active form
of SFKs was almost undetectable. Further confirming
the specificity of SI221 towards active SFKs, SI211
effectiveness decreased during C2C12 differentiation,
mirroring the reduction in the expression of the active
form of SFKs.
We also tested the selectivity of SI221 in a kinase
activity screening assay and found that this compound
specifically inhibited SFKs, without affecting the activity
of the other kinases included in the panel. Moreover,
SI221 proved to be mainly effective against the SFK
member YES, which has recently been recognized as
a player in RMS development, as shown by the high
expression of YES mRNA in RMSs compared with
normal tissues, YES hyperactivation in RMS cell lines,
and the ability of short hairpin RNAs against YES to
inhibit RMS cell growth [8].
To date, several small molecules targeting SFKs
have been developed [9]. In the present study, we
compared the effectiveness of SI221 with that of the wellknown SFK inhibitor PP2. Consistent with our previous
works showing that PP2 was less effective in different
tumor types compared with our compounds [11, 12, 22–24],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we observed that PP2 was less effective than SI221 in the
RD cell line. However, in RH30 cells the two inhibitors
showed a similar efficacy.
We then evaluated whether the cytotoxic effects
induced by SFK inhibition on RMS cells were due to cell
cycle arrest or to cell death. We did not find significant
effects on cell cycle distribution 72 hours after treatment.
Conversely, consistent with the ability of various SFKs to
activate antiapoptotic pathways [25, 26], we observed that
SFK inhibition through SI221 induced apoptosis in RMS
cell lines.
It is well-established that the most studied SFK
member, SRC, is also involved in promoting cell motility
and invasion. Indeed, increased SRC kinase activity is
associated with the metastatic potential of many tumor
types and SRC has an important role in regulating focal
adhesion and adherent junctions, which are the principal
subcellular structures involved in cell adhesion, motility
and invasion [6]. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of
SI221 on the ability of RMS cells to migrate and invade
and found a decrease in both these processes after
treatment with SI221.
Considering that RMS arise from committed
skeletal muscle precursor cells that fail to differentiate and
that the induction of RMS differentiation is a recognized
strategy to suppress the transformed phenotype [3],

we analyzed whether SFK inhibition could be able to
restore the differentiation program in RMS cells. We
observed evident morphological changes in SI221-treated
RD and RH30 cells, which became larger, flatter and
multinucleated. These morphological changes seemed
indicative of multinucleated myotube formation, although
nuclei were not arranged linearly as in myotubes. Similar
morphological changes were previously observed in
RMS cell lines and demonstrated to be associated with
myogenic differentiation [27]. Consistently, we observed
an increase in myogenic markers (myogenin and MYH) in
RMS cells treated with SI221.
MYH was expressed both in the nuclei and
cytoplasm of SI221-treated RMS cells, consistent with
what previously observed in RMS cells that underwent
differentiation in response to different stimuli [19, 20].
This diffuse pattern of MYH expression could seem
inconsistent with the typical cytoplasmic localization
of myosin. However, although myosin was classically
thought to function only in the cytoplasm, it is now wellestablished that different myosin types also have specific
nuclear roles [28]. In particular, embryonic myosin
has also been found in nuclei [28] and this myosin type
represents a differentiation marker for RMS [29, 30].
Therefore, considering that the antibody (MF-20) used
in this study recognizes MYH at all stages of embryonic
development [31], it is likely that the MYH found in
nuclei of differentiating RMS cells under SI221 treatment
is the embryonic isoform, although this needs to be further
assessed.
To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying
SFK inhibition-induced RMS cell differentiation, we
analyzed whether SFK inhibition could be able to
modulate the expression of differentiation regulators in
RMS cells. Given the recently recognized role of SFKs
in NOTCH [16] and p38 MAPK [13] pathways, we
focused on the effects of SFK inhibition on the expression
of these proteins, which play opposite roles in muscle
differentiation and whose expression is altered in RMS.
In particular, NOTCH signaling has a role in inhibiting
muscle differentiation and is upregulated in RMS cells
[15, 17–19], whereas p38 MAPK promotes muscle
differentiation [32] and is impaired in RMS cells [20].
Consistent with the recent observation that SFK
inhibition was able to decrease the active cleaved form of
NOTCH1 in pancreatic cancer cells [16], we found that
SI221 greatly decreased the cleaved form of NOTCH3 in
both RD and RH30 cell lines. This is noteworthy because
NOTCH3 inhibition by RNA interference was recently
shown to induce myogenic differentiation in both RD and
RH30 cells [19].
Moreover, we observed that SI221 activated
p38 MAPK in both RMS cell lines and that the
pharmacological inactivation of p38 MAPK inhibited the
SI221-induced muscle differentiation, thus demonstrating
that p38 MAPK is required for the differentiation program
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

triggered by SFK inhibition in RMS cells. This finding
is consistent with previous studies showing that SFK
inhibition is able to induce muscle differentiation in
C2C12 cells through p38 MAPK activation [13] and that
p38 MAPK constitutive activation is able to induce RMS
differentiation [20].
Therefore, our data indicate that SFK inhibition
can trigger the recovery of the differentiation program in
RMS cells by decreasing cleaved NOTCH3, which inhibit
muscle differentiation, and increasing the active form of
p38 MAPK, which promotes differentiation.
We also showed, through the transfection of the
constitutively active intracellular form of NOTCH3, that
the ability of SI221 to induce an increase in phospho-p38
MAPK was a secondary consequence of its inhibitory
action on NOTCH3. This observation is consistent with
previous studies reporting that NOTCH signaling is able
to suppress the activity of p38 MAPK in C2C12 cells
[21] and that NOTCH3 inhibition by RNA interference
activates p38 MAPK in RMS cell lines [19]. Overall,
our findings indicate that inhibiting SFKs could induce
the differentiation program in RMS cells by hindering an
SFK–NOTCH3–p38 MAPK axis.
We also observed that SI221 was able to reduce
tumor growth in a xenograft model of RMS. Thus,
although further experiments are required to assess
whether SI221 acts in vivo through the same mechanisms
observed in vitro, this pilot in vivo study suggests that
specific SFK inhibition could represent a feasible approach
for RMS treatment.
In conclusion, we observed that SFK inhibition
through SI221 reduced RMS cell viability and migration
in vitro and decreased tumor growth in xenotrasplanted
mice. Our data also strongly suggest that SFK inhibition
can induce RMS differentiation by hindering an SFKNOTCH3–p38 MAPK axis. Thus, our observations
define a possible new mechanism involving SFKs in
RMS cell failure to differentiate and provide a new
rationale for targeting SFKs in RMS. Indeed, SFK
inhibition, besides reducing tumor cell growth and
invasive potential, could also represent a differentiation
therapeutic strategy for RMS.

METHODS
Cell culture
RD and RH30 rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines
were recently purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, respec­
tively, and maintained at a low passage number. The
mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 was purchased from
ATCC and primary human skin fibroblasts were a kind
gift of Michele Fimiani, Giancarlo Mariotti and Stefania
Mei (University of Siena, Italy) [33].

Cells were maintained in DMEM (RD, fibroblasts
and C2C12) and RPMI-1640 (RH30) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-Glutamine.
For differentiation induction, C2C12 cells were
cultured until subconfluence in growth medium (GM),
as described above, and then shifted to DM consisting of
DMEM containing 2% horse serum.

β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, signals were
detected using the Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Pierce) and autoradiography films (Pierce).

Cell treatment with the SFK inhibitors, MTS
assay and kinase activity screening assay

RD and RH30 cells were seeded in 100 mm
diameter petri dishes and, 24 hours after seeding, treated
with SI221 at its IC50 values or DMSO. Seventy-two
hours after treatment, cells were harvested, washed with
PBS and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. Nuclei were
stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) plus 20 μg/ml
RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C overnight in the dark and
analyzed with a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson). Data were analyzed using a BD FACSDiva
software (Becton Dickinson).
Apoptosis was evaluated by cell staining with
annexin V-FITC and PI (Annexin V-FITC kit, Miltenyi
Biotec Inc.) and FACS analysis 72 hours after treatment,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cytoflourimetric analyses of cell cycle profile
and apoptosis

The pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative SFK inhibitor
SI221 was synthesized as previously reported [34]. SI221 and
the commercially available SFK inhibitor PP2 (4-amino-5-(4chlorophenyl)-7-(dimethylethyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine,
Calbiochem) were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) to a
concentration of 20 mM and then diluted in culture medium
before use.
RD, RH30, C2C12 cell lines and fibroblasts were
seeded in 96-well plates 24 hours before treatment with
the SFK inhibitors at concentrations ranging from 1 to
15 μM. Control cells were treated with DMSO at the
maximum amount used to deliver the SFK inhibitors.
DMSO showed no toxic effect on all the cell lines (data not
shown). Seventy-two hours after treatment, cell viability
was evaluated by MTS assay (CellTiter 96® AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega), following the
manufacturer’s instructions, through spectrophotometric
reading at two different wavelengths (540 and 630 nm).
IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism
Software, version 5.01 for Windows. To calculate the IC50
of C2C12 cells, the SFK inhibitor concentration range was
extended up to 25 μM.
To evaluate the selectivity of SI221 towards the SFK
members, we tested this SFK inhibitor, at the concentration
of 10 μM, against a panel of 29 different kinases, including
8 SFKs (Merck Millipore KinaseProfiler service).

Caspase-3 activity assay
RD and RH30 cells were seeded and treated for 72
hours with SI221 or DMSO, as described above. Caspase-3
enzymatic activity was evaluated in cellular lysates using
the Colorimetric Caspase-3 Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. This assay is
based on the hydrolysis of the peptide substrate acetylAsp-Glu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide by caspase-3, resulting
in the release of the p-nitroaniline (pNA) moiety. The
absorbance of pNA was measured by spectrophotometry
at 405 nm through a microplate reader. pNA pmols were
determined by a calibration curve prepared with defined
pNA solutions. Caspase-3 activity is expressed as pmol
pNA/μg protein × time (hours).

Protein extraction and western blotting

Migration and invasion analysis

Cells were harvested on ice in lysis buffer consisting
of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM EDTA pH 8, 150
mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 0.3
mM PMSF, a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and
the phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Equal amounts of proteins (50 μg) per sample were
electrophoresed and blotted onto PVDF membranes (BioRad), which were then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk
or 5% BSA (for antibodies against phospho-proteins)
and incubated with antibodies against: phospho-SRC
family (Tyr416) (this antibody detects SRC only when
phosphorylated at Tyr416, which corresponds to human
Tyr419. It cross-reacts with the other SFK members when
phosphorylated at equivalent sites), SRC, FYN, LCK, LYN,
YES, phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), p38 MAPK
(Cell Signaling); BLK, FGR, HCK, MYH, myogenin,
NOTCH3, GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and

To analyze the effect of SFK inhibition on RMS
cell motility, we performed scratch assays. In particular,
RD and RH30 cells were grown to confluence on tissue
culture plates and a scratch was made in the confluent
monolayer using a sterile pipette tip. Cells were washed
with PBS and then complete medium containing either
SI221 at its IC50 values (as previously evaluated at
72 hours after treatment) or DMSO, as a control, was
added. Cells were photographed at 0 and 24 hours after
treatment.
The effect of SI221 on the invasive ability of
RH30 cells was evaluated using 6-well modified Boyden
chambers with Matrigel-coated 8 μm pore size membranes
(Becton Dickinson). Cells were placed in the upper
compartment in medium containing 3% FBS, whereas
serum-free medium was placed in the lower compartment.
12432

Oncotarget

Cells were allowed to adhere for 16 hours and then treated
with SI221 at its 72-hour IC50 value or with DMSO, as a
control. Medium containing 20% FBS was placed in the
bottom compartment, as a chemoattractant. Twenty-four
hours after treatment cells on top of the membrane were
scraped off and discarded. Cells that invaded through the
Matrigel were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. After removing the membrane with a scalpel blade
and placing it on a microscope slide, cells were counted
by observation through light microscopy. Twenty fields
chosen randomly from both the center and periphery of the
membrane were examined and three separate experiments
were conducted.
To verify that the number of viable cells was not
significantly affected by SI221 treatment at the culture times
used for the migration and invasion assays, we also performed
parallel experiments in which cells were identically treated in
6-well tissue culture plates and then harvested and assessed
for cell viability by trypan blue staining.

Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies).
Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 M

Cell transfection
RH30 cells were seeded in 100 mm diameter petri
dishes and, 24 hours after seeding, transfected with
10 μg of a vector expressing the intracellular form of
NOTCH3 (Addgene) or a control empty vector through
the TransIT®-2020 tranfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Upon
transfection, cells were treated with either SI221 (at its
IC50 values) or DMSO, as a control, and total proteins
were extracted after 72 hours for western blotting analysis.

Cell treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580
RD and RH30 cells were seeded in 100 mm
diameter petri dishes and on cover slips. Twenty-four
hours after seeding, cells were treated with 10 μM
SB203580 (Calbiochem) and/or SI221 at its 72-hour
IC50 values, or DMSO. Six days after treatment, cells
were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or by
immunofluorescence or harvested for western blotting
analysis.

Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from RD and RH30 cells,
treated for 3, 4, 5 and 6 days with either SI221 (at its IC50
values) or DMSO, using the miRNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The expression
of MYOG and MYH2 was analyzed by real-time qRT-PCR.
Five hundred nanograms of RNA were reverse transcribed
with the iScript cDNA Synthesys kit (Bio-Rad). One
microliter of cDNA was amplified in the Opticon 2 real-time
PCR cycler (MJ Research) using the Sso Fast EvaGreen
Supermix (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Forty cycles of PCR were performed using
an annealing temperature of 60°C. The mRNA levels were
normalized to those of the housekeeping GAPDH gene.
MYOG and MYH2 expression in treated cells was calculated
by the 2-ΔΔCt method [35] relatively to control cells.
Primer sequences were 5′-CAGCGAATGCAGCTCTC
ACA-3′ and 5′-AGTTGGGCATGGTTTCATCTG-3′ for
MYOG [36]; 5′-CTGATGCCATGGAATGACTG-3′ and
5′-CCCTATGCTTTATTTCCTTTGC-3′ for MYH2 [37]
and 5′-AGCCCCCGGACCTGCACT-3′ and 5′-CCGG
CAAAAACAAATAAGTTGACT-3′ for GAPDH.

Xenograft experiments
All experimental procedures involving animals
and their care were approved by the Institutional Review
Board and ethic committee of the University of L’Aquila
in compliance with national and international laws and
policies. RD cells were cultured in standard conditions
until reaching the 80% of confluence, then were detached
with a trypsin/EDTA solution, counted and adjusted at a
density of 2 × 106 cells per 200 μl of 10 mg/ml Matrigel
solution in saline buffer. Cancer cells were injected
subcutaneously into the flank of immunodeficient mice
(CD1 nude mice from Charles River Laboratories
International, Inc.). Before any invasive manipulation,
mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine
(25 mg/ml)/xylazine (5 mg/ml). Tumor growth was
monitored daily and measured by caliper. When tumor mass
was evident (100–200 mm3) mice were assigned randomly
to different experimental groups: a control group receiving
the vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) and a treatment group
receiving 50 mg/kg of SI221 three times a week per os.
After 40 days tumors were harvested and weighed.

Immunofluorescence
RD and RH30 cells were grown on cover slips and
treated with SI221 at its 72-hour IC50 values or DMSO,
as a control. Six days after treatment, cells were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized by
0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Samples were then
blocked in 1% BSA for 20 min and then incubated with the
MF-20 antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank
at the University of Iowa) for 2 h. After washing, samples
were incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat Anti-Mouse
IgG (H+L) Antibody (Life Technologies) at 37°C for 45
min. The coverslips were mounted using the ProLong

t test. The unpaired Student t test was used to compare
the mean tumor volumes between control and SI221treated xenotransplanted mice at each evaluation time. The
unpaired Student t test was also used to compare the mean
weights of tumors excised from control and SI221-treated
mice at the end of treatment. P < 0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.
