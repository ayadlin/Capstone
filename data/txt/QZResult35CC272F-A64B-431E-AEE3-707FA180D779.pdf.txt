BACKGROUND: The survival impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on esophageal cancer remains difficult to establish for
specific patients. The aim of the current study was to create a Web-based prediction tool providing individualized survival projections
based on tumor and treatment data. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer between 1997 and 2005 were selected
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. The covariates analyzed were sex, T and N classification, histology, total number of lymph nodes examined, and treatment with esophagectomy or CRT followed by esophagectomy.
After propensity score weighting, a log-logistic regression model for overall survival was selected based on the Akaike information
criterion. RESULTS: A total of 824 patients with esophageal cancer who were treated with esophagectomy or trimodal therapy met
the selection criteria. On multivariate analysis, age, sex, T and N classification, number of lymph nodes examined, treatment, and histology were found to be significantly associated with overall survival and were included in the regression analysis. Preoperative staging data and final surgical margin status were not available within the SEER-Medicare data set and therefore were not included. The
model predicted that patients with T4 or lymph node disease benefitted from CRT. The internally validated concordance index was
0.72. CONCLUSIONS: The SEER-Medicare database of patients with esophageal cancer can be used to produce a survival prediction
tool that: 1) serves as a counseling and decision aid to patients and 2) assists in risk modeling. Patients with T4 or lymph node disease appeared to benefit from CRT. This nomogram may underestimate the benefit of CRT due to its variable downstaging effect on

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal cancer is a significant worldwide health problem, and its incidence in the United States and Western Europe is
rapidly increasing.1,2 Patients frequently present with advanced stage disease, compromised performance status, and have
a poor prognosis even with aggressive interventions. In a recent prospective randomized trial, the addition of neoadjuvant
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to surgery was found to improve 5-year survival probability from 34% for patients treated
with isolated esophagectomy to 47% for patients treated with CRT followed by surgery for intermediate-staged cancers.3
However, response to neoadjuvant treatment can vary even among patients with similar clinical pretreatment disease
stage (cTNM). The spectrum of heterogeneous responses ranges from no response at all to a pathologic complete response
(pCR), with no invasive disease identified in the surgical specimen. If neoadjuvant treatment produces a pCR, outcomes
are better: patients with a pCR can expect a 5-year survival rate of 48%, versus 18% for patients who do not respond.4
However, selecting the therapeutic strategy for each patient continues to be challenging, as patients with early-stage disease
may experience no benefit from CRT whereas those with lymph node (LN) involvement are more likely to receive benefit
(Figure 1).
Preoperatively, with only the cTNM stage available, the selection of the patients who will benefit from this aggressive
treatment continues to be a challenge. Potentially, 3 categories of data allow for discriminating between which patients
will obtain a benefit from CRT and which will solely be exposed to potential morbidity and mortality: clinical factors, biomarkers, and functional imaging data. Although these last 2 are promising, to the best of our knowledge, no combination

of available clinical data are currently reliable enough to
indicate which patients are going to experience a notable
survival benefit from receiving CRT followed by esophagectomy and which patients should be treated only with
selected modalities. Thus, traditional clinical factors such
as the available tumor stage, patient age, and performance
status are still used to select the best therapy for a particular patient.
Using the patient data available in the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, the goal of the current study was to construct an
interactive Web-based to tool to predict individual patient
survival based on their individual pathologic, demographic, and treatment data and subsequently aid in medical decision-making, patient education, and, potentially,
research protocol design.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The SEER registry is the largest population-based database of oncology patients in the United States, as per their
report covering approximately 26% of patients diagnosed
with cancer in the nation.5 The SEER-Medicare6 database
is linked via a deidentified numeric system to include
Medicare claims data on catalogued SEER patients,
thereby allowing for the inclusion of clinical information
not contained in SEER, such as receipt of chemotherapy.
The study cohort includes claims data from 1995 to 2007
linked to patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2005.
Patients were selected using Site Recode 5 11 for Esophageal Cancer (17325). Patients were included in our analysis if they were identified as having invasive,

nonmetastatic disease on surgical pathology and underwent an attempted complete surgical resection of the primary tumor. The analysis was limited to patients
aged > 65 years and who were receiving continuous Medicare part A and B coverage for at least 6 months after their
diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Patients who received
combined CRT before surgery were included in the analysis. Patients who received either isolated radiotherapy (RT)
or chemotherapy were excluded. Using the SEER field for
Extent of Disease (e10ex1) and LNs (e10 nd1), patients
were grouped according to American Joint Committee on
Cancer TNM staging (using the 7th edition) (SEER Patient
Entitlement and Diagnosis Summary File). Patients with
inadequate available data were excluded.
To determine which patients had received chemotherapy, linked Medicare carrier claims (National Claims
History) and outpatient (Outpatient Standard Analytical
File) files were used. Patients who had Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System claim codes 96400 to
96599, Q0083-85, or J8500-J9999 within 6 months of
diagnosis were coded as having received chemotherapy.
Patients who were coded as having received external beam
RT before surgery were coded and as having received RT.
Patients who received both of these treatments were
included for analysis and were designated as having
received neoadjuvant CRT.
Statistical Analysis

Data processing and modeling were performed using the
R software package (r-project.org). Kaplan-Meier survival
estimates were created using SPSS statistical software (version 20; IBM SPSS Inc, Armonk, NY). Covariates and
interaction terms were selected a priori based on suspected
clinically relevant oncologic data and the availability of
data within our SEER-Medicare database. Included covariates were age, sex, histology, T classification, N classification, and the number of LN examined. Sex, histology,
T classification, and N classification were assessed as discrete categorical variables. The total number of LNs harvested (total LN) and patient age were considered as
continuous variables. Age was fitted to a smoothed restricted cubic spline function as per Herrell.7 Interaction
terms between treatment and T classification, N classification, and total LN were included. A propensity score
weighting method was used to balance observed covariates
between treatment and observation groups.8 Propensity
scores reflect the probability that a patient will receive
therapy based on observed covariates. By assigning propensity score weights to each variable and incorporating
these weights into model construction, one can reduce the

treatment bias inherent to retrospective nonrandomized
regression analysis. Scores were calculated using the twang
R library (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twang/index.
html), with CRT as the outcome of interest.
The primary endpoint of analysis was overall survival (OS). Multivariate regression survival analysis was
performed using several different regression functions and
their results were compared. Our method of model comparison has been reported previously.9,10 We built both
semiparametric models (Cox proportional hazards) and
parametric models (Weibull, exponential, log logistic,
and lognormal). All survival models were constructed
using the rms R library by Harrell (cran.r-project.org/
web/packages/rms).7 Model performance was evaluated
using the Akaike information criteria (AIC), a measure of
goodness of fit, with the calculated value representing the
amount of information lost in model creation.11 Based on
this AIC, we selected the log logistic regression survival
function for definitive analysis. This survival model was
internally validated using a bootstrap resampling. Discrimination was evaluated using the concordance index.
The concordance index represents the percentage of all usable patient pairs in which the modeled prediction and
the observed outcome are concordant.
The best performing survival prediction model, in
our case the log logistic survival function, was then implemented into an online nomogram. Using this online

interactive tool, a user can enter the analyzed multivariate
parameters specific to a patient and obtain an estimate of
the expected survival based on these factors and the treatment the patient received (CRT or isolated esophagectomy). The browser-based tool was programmed in
JavaScript.
RESULTS
A total of 824 patients were included in the final analysis.
Of these, 32% received CRT, with the remaining patients
undergoing isolated esophagectomy (Table 1). Our demographic table demonstrates the stage of disease and demographic information for the study population both as a
whole and stratified by treatment received. Patients who
were treated with CRT tended to have a higher T classification (Table 1) and had generally equivalent rates of LN
metastasis. One would expect that with a higher average T
classification, the N classification would also be higher.
The noted equivalence of rates of LN metastasis is likely
due to some percentage of patients with LN disease being
downstaged by their preoperative CRT. Given the higher
average stage of disease and associated worse prognosis for
patients undergoing trimodality therapy, it is not surprising that the unweighted beta coefficient for CRT has a
strong negative prognostic effect (Table 2). However,
when the interaction terms for CRT by T classification
and N classification are considered, the beneficial effect of
CRT on patients with these advanced disease stages, even
within the setting of variable downstaging, is evident. Figure 1 represents a Kaplan-Meier OS curve comparing
patients with LN disease who either received or did not
receive CRT. A significant survival benefit was observed
for patients with residual N1 disease who received CRT
compared with those who did not (P 5 .017). The unadjusted median survival for all patients was 24 months. The
median LN yield was 10.7 LNs.
Propensity score weighting was performed as
described above, after which each model was evaluated for
its fidelity using the AIC. The log logistic model had the
lowest AIC of 4135, indicating a better fit and least loss of
information, in comparison with the other parametric
and semiparametric regression models (Cox proportional
hazards, 11,453; Weibull, 8230; exponential, 8255; and
log normal, 8066). The survival function for the log logistic regression is calculated as S(time) 5 1/(1 1 e((ln(time)Xbeta)/Scale)
). The scale value is represented in Table 2 as
the log scale.
The log-logistic function had relatively good discrimination with a concordance index of 0.72. The complete list of beta coefficients produced by the regression

each LN harvested, this benefit decreases slightly,
although this may be a surrogate for higher N stage. The
largest benefit is predicted in patients with T3N1 and
T4N1 disease. Table 3 demonstrates that for a patient
with the above selected demographic and clinical data
with ypT4N1 disease, our model predicts a 3-year survival rate of 20% for patients undergoing isolated esophagectomy versus 62% for patients treated with CRT
followed by esophagectomy.
The predicted survival benefit from neoadjuvant
CRT persisted for those patients with advanced disease
present after treatment and for those with lower T stage
disease with LN involvement. For example, after receipt
of neoadjuvant CRT, the patient with ypT4N2 disease
mentioned earlier would have a predicted 3-year OS rate
of 29% versus 12% for patients treated without CRT. A
similar patient with ypT2N1 disease is predicted to have a
3-year OS rate of 64% with neoadjuvant CRT versus
45% with isolated esophagectomy.

data convincingly demonstrated the survival benefit of

neoadjuvant CRT followed by esophagectomy compared
with isolated esophagectomy for clinically determined
patient populations with intermediate-stage esophageal
cancer. Patients with advanced stage cancers, based on
clinical staging, were not included in their analysis.3 In
addition, at least 30% of the patients treated achieved a
limited response to treatment and derived significantly
less survival benefit compared with patients with partial
responses and CRs.12 Many believe that the survival benefit observed among patients with advanced stage disease is
not uniformly shared, being noted among those patients
who achieve a pathologic response. In addition, survival
benefit may be entirely absent for those patients with no
observable downstaging.13,14
There is an evolving and progressive expectation
among patients and medical providers for personalized
medical care and treatment. Decision tools, incorporating
clinical, molecular, and radiographic data to predict
response to treatment paralleled by the likelihood of its
toxicity, will be an integral part of personalized care. The
production of clinical prediction tools, or nomograms,
has greatly increased over the past several years. In addition to being applied to a myriad of site-specific
neoplasms and treatment-specific survival, they are used
for predicting perioperative morbidity, mortality, and
dichotomous selected outcomes. For example, in patients
with esophageal cancer alone, there are institutional- and
database-derived predictive tools available for perioperative morbidity and mortality, OS after isolated esophagectomy, pathologic LN involvement based on clinical data,
and OS after definitive CRT, also known as bimodal
therapy.7,15-18 To the best of our knowledge, there has
been no report to date that includes production of a tool
predicting outcomes after trimodality therapy or comparing trimodality therapy with esophagectomy and we
believe ours is the first.
496

Analysis of our demographic data, available in
Table 1, demonstrates similar stage distribution and survival outcomes in comparison with established largevolume databases.19 The distribution of TNM staging is
similar to the largest compiled database of patients with
resected esophageal cancer, with a relative paucity of T2
patients. The same database found 57% of their patients
to be free of LN metastasis, which is similar to our cumulative value of 60%. Patients who were treated with CRT
tended to have a higher T classification (Table 1), and had
generally equivalent rates of LN metastasis. One might
expect that with a higher average T classification, the N
classification would also be higher. The noted equivalence
of rates of LN metastasis could be due to some percentage
of patients with LN disease being downstaged by their
preoperative CRT. The patients treated with CRT and
isolated esophagectomy were found to have similar mean
LN yields (10.5 LNs and 10.9 LNs, respectively).
Standard pathologic TNM staging from the surgical
specimen after neoadjuvant CRT (ypTNM) continues to be
more prognostic of survival than restaging or preoperative
data, despite a variable downstaging effect.20 A neoadjuvant
treatment strategy makes estimating the survival benefit of
CRT based on surgical stage challenging due to pathologic
downstaging in approximately 70% of patients.12 Meanwhile, currently available techniques for clinical TNM staging, especially restaging, are unreliable.7,21
However, the survival benefit of CRT is likely not
distributed evenly across all patients. Those patients who
achieve a pCR, with no residual tumor identifiable in the
surgical specimen, or even those with a partial response
after neoadjuvant CRT, have a better prognosis than those
that have no appreciable or minimal response to
CRT.13,14 Identification of a molecular or histologic
marker that is that predicts pCR following CRT would
provide useful adjunctive clinical information, although
others have attempted to predict clinical surrogates for
benefit from CRT.22 It is worth noting that based on our
model, even patients with a heavy residual disease burden
demonstrated on pathology after CRT received a survival
benefit from their trimodality treatment when compared
with patients with comparable pathologic stage undergoing isolated esophagectomy. We predict that a typical
patient with ypT4N3 disease received an estimated 9month median survival benefit from their CRT,
irrespective of their clinical stage of disease.
However, evaluation of the applicable and clinical
significance of the survival data from the current study
and subsequent model reveals several limitations inherent
to the SEER-Medicare database. Primarily, there are no

clinical staging data within the database that are appropriate for analysis. Therefore, all staging is based on final
pathology. Subsequently, a patient’s response to CRT
cannot be assessed. Other limitations intrinsic to the
SEER-Medicare database that are relevant to esophageal
cancer include the lack of information regarding surgical
margins, disease recurrence, or chemotherapy agent.
There are data available regarding the “largest recorded
size of the tumor.” However, this data point was variably
recorded and was not available for a significant number of
patients in the current study. In addition, because the
analysis uses the Medicare data set, it would not be appropriate to apply the predictive tool to patients aged < 65
years. Although a similar predictive tool that includes
institutional prospectively collected clinical data and specific chemotherapeutic regimens would be ideal, and will
likely ultimately be possible, several obstacles currently
exist to its production and implementation.
Institutional data may not be widely applicable.
Several nomograms that have attempted to estimate
perioperative morbidity and mortality have resulted in
relatively low predictive power when compared across
institutions.17,18 Although the issue of generalizability is
perennial, it is particularly troublesome for a disease as
complex as esophageal cancer. Similarly, with regard to
the incorporation of clinical data, specifically endoscopic
ultrasound and positron emission tomography, institutional protocols and interpretation vary greatly. A recent
review has detailed the difficulties in comparing positron
emission tomography standardized uptake value changes
for esophageal cancer across studies and institutions.23
Although endoscopic ultrasound is widely used for clinical
staging, its value in predictive tools similar to ours may be
limited due to its low predictive power of LN involvement
and interoperator variability.15,24 Finally, pathologic stage
has been validated as a powerful predictor of outcome after receipt of CRT and esophagectomy.20
Because of the technical limitations of our data set, a
direct comparison of patients who received CRT with
those who did not in our population presents a challenge.
However, one can say that even patients with significant
residual disease after CRT obtained a significant survival
benefit from their receipt of CRT in comparison with
similarly staged patients who underwent surgery. Certainly, patients with LN metastases on clinical staging or
those with a high suspicion of LN metastases should be
strongly considered for CRT before surgery.
Because it is based on pathologic stage, this analytic
tool is most applicable in the postoperative setting, when
the ypTNM stage is available for postoperative counselCancer

ing, comparison, and treatment planning. In addition,
such risk modeling is helpful in the design of research protocols for the identification of homogenous high-risk
groups. One would expect the model to underestimate the
benefit of neoadjuvant therapy due to its expected downstaging effect on ypTNM staging compared with cTNM
staging. The ultimate goal of a predictive decision aid for
designing an individualized treatment course would
include early identification, or even prediction, of responders and nonresponders, thereby leading to avoidance
of ineffective and dangerous applications of both CRT
and surgery. The development of a widely applicable and
highly discriminatory decision aid that identifies those
patients who will benefit from CRT with a low likelihood
of toxicity will likely include traditional TNM staging,
functional radiologic assays, performance status of the
patient, and, potentially, a compiled genetic signature.
Although the predictive tool described in the current
study does suffer from retrospective and pathologic staging limitations, it provides a statistical, usable, and
patient-friendly blue print for predicting survival based
on treatment and patient-specific clinical variables. Our
online tool is currently available for use and can be found
at skynet.ohsu.edu/nomograms.
