compounds from the series inhibited growth and phosphoAKT levels in HCT116 cells in the 100 nM range in vitro,
independent of PI3K mutational status. An unexpected
finding occurred during the in vivo evaluation of two
such compounds from the series. Although phospho-AKT
levels were robustly inhibited in HCT116 xenograft tumor
tissue, this translated into only modest effects on tumor
growth inhibition. In contrast, when the compounds were
evaluated in a metastatic version of the HCT116 model,
wherein tumor cells injected into the spleen spread to
the liver and lungs, the emergence of distant metastases
was significantly curtailed [5]. The conclusions from
this work – that PI3Kα inhibitors may be more useful for
limiting the spread of a primary tumor to distant sites than
treating established tumors – would be strengthened by
additional studies incorporating isoform specific shRNAs
in one or more in vivo tumor models. Still, the findings
are provocative and raise many interesting questions.

	
The link between PI3K and cancer is among
the strongest in the genome. PI3K sits in a critical node
in cancer signaling space where it integrates growth and
survival signals from RTKs and Ras to the mTOR, MAPK,
FOXO1 and GSK3β signaling pathways. The Class I
PI3Ks are dimeric kinases comprised of one regulatory
subunit (p85 α, β, or γ) and one catalytic subunit (p110 α,
β, or γ) which phosphorylate phosphoinositides at the D-3
position of the inositol ring in response to environmental
cues. Constitutive activation of the PI3Ks is transforming
in experimental models and in human breast, colon and
endometrial cancer, activating mutations in the gene for
PIK3CA (p110α) are seen in 30% of the patient population.
Inactivating mutations to the p85 regulatory subunit have
been described in a subpopulation (~10%) of colorectal
cancer patients. Moreover, the PTEN phosphoinositide
phosphatase, nature’s brake to proliferative PI3K
signaling, is a frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene
[1, 2 and references therein].
Given the successes over the last decade in
developing small molecule inhibitors targeting the
BCR-ABL, EGFR, and BRAF oncogenic kinases, it is
not surprising that numerous PI3K inhibitors have been
developed and are currently being evaluated in human
clinical trials. Despite the fact that among the p110
isoforms, p110α is preferentially mutated in cancer, the
first wave of PI3K inhibitors to enter the clinic consisted
of non-isoform selective (pan) molecules. While these
inhibitors are broadly active in preclinical cancer models
[3, 4] concern as to whether the lack of selectivity may
adversely impact the therapeutic index has led to follow
up efforts to develop isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors.
Working from an imidazopyridine-based scaffold,
Schmidt-Kittler et al optimized PI3Kα-selective inhibitors
with nM potency against PI3Kα (J-series). Among class
I PI3Ks (α, β, γ, δ) the J-series compounds averaged
20 to 30 fold selectivity in favor of the p110α isoform
in vitro but did not discriminate between wt and mutant
(E545K, H1047R) forms of the enzyme. Representative

Why does in vitro anti-proliferative activity not
translate to the in vivo setting?
J124 and J128 displayed potent inhibition of
HCT116 growth in vitro in the nM range. Arcaro and
coworkers also reported single agent activity in vitro with
PI3Kα-selective inhibitors in a panel of medulloblastoma
cell lines [6].
Assuming intra-tumoral levels of the J-series
compounds reached exposures equivalent to those
assessed in vitro (~100nM), why was potent antiproliferative activity against the primary tumor not
observed despite effective modulation of the phosphoAKT pharmacodynamic marker? The data suggest that
modulation of phospho-AKT is insufficient for in vivo
anti-tumor activity and beg the question – what PI3Kαdependent processes impact the spread of the primary
tumor? One also can’t help but wonder whether p110α
mutational status impacts the metastatic potential of a
tumor.

What is the mechanism of action through which
PI3Kα regulates metastasis?

PI3Ks can phosphorylate both lipid and protein
substrates. It is tempting to speculate that the modulation
of as yet undefined substrates regulating angiogenesis, cell
adhesion or migration accounts for these observations.
Identification of these biomarkers will be essential for
successful clinical evaluation of these compounds.

How should α-selective inhibitors be evaluated in
the clinic?

If indeed the utility of such compounds lies in
preventing cancer spread, the best setting for single agent
treatment may be in situations where measurable disease
is not an issue (i.e. surgically removed or irradiated)
and prevention of new lesions is needed. While first or
second line treatment of advanced or metastatic disease
may benefit patients by virtue of preventing new lesions,
the ideal treatment setting is likely as an adjuvant therapy
in patients with initially resectable localized disease with
high metastatic recurrence rates. A potential endpoint
would be progression free survival following surgery in
patients receiving PI3Kα inhibitor therapy vs. standard of
care adjuvant chemotherapy.
PI3Kα inhibitor therapy may also be well suited
for use in combination with other targeted or cytotoxic
agents, as has been shown for pan PI3K inhibitors and
MEK inhibitors in models of basal-like breast cancer [7].
In closing, the findings of Schmidt-Kittler et al
leave fertile ground for exploratory research in numerous
directions. The emergence of PI3Kα-selective tool
compounds should catalyze future discoveries that can
inform the medical community on the optimal use of such
agents upon their arrival in the clinic.
