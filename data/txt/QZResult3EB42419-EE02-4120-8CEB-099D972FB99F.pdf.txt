ABSTRACT:
FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem/
progenitor cells (HSPCs) and is important for both normal myeloid and lymphoid
differentiation. FLT3 expression in Pax5 negative lymphoid precursors coincides with
a window of multilineage differentiation potential in mice and humans. Recent work
has shown that FLT3 activating mutations can collaborate with a Nup98-HoxD13
mutation to induce an aggressive acute leukemia. The leukemic initiating population
in this model displayed properties of both lymphoid and myeloid precursors, making
it a useful tool to study the role of FLT3 in lineage plasticity. Through a variety of
assays, the leukemic initiating population was shown to be restricted to myeloid
differentiation, suggesting that the B-lineage properties in these cells are due to the
priming of lymphoid transcription programs in multipotent progenitors rather than a
true capacity for B-cell maturation. The development of an undifferentiated myeloid
leukemia in this model, also has implications for the role of FLT3 in the inhibition
of myeloid differentiation. Here we discuss the insights gained from this model.

INTRODUCTION

ITD mutation alone induces a lethal myeloproliferative
neoplasm (MPN) [7] and the Nup98-HoxD13 translocation
alone produces a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), mice
bred to express both mutations develop an acute leukemia
with short latency and 100% penetrance.
Initially, the leukemia observed in this model
appeared to express cell surface markers characteristic
of both primitive myeloid and lymphoid development.
The induction of a biphenotypic leukemia in this model
would be surprising given the clinical data documenting
the role of both Nup98 translocations and FLT3/ITD
mutations in myeloid disease. The case reports describing
patients harboring a Nup98-HoxD13 translocation have
all reported myeloid malignancies; 1 case of therapy
related acute erythroid leukemia and 3 cases with acute
myelomonocytic leukemia [8-11]. To date, no Nup98
translocations have been observed in a patient with a
B-cell malignancy [12]. Similarly, FLT3-ITD mutations
are largely restricted to subtypes of AML, and are rarely
reported in cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
[2, 13-14]. Finally, the FLT3/ITD-NHD13 model mimics
the stepwise progression of a pre-leukemic disorder
characterized by myelodyspasia, to overt leukemia that is
frequently observed in patients. Approximately, 30% of

The commitment of cells to myeloid or lymphoid
lineage development is considered to be an irreversible
process, whereby distinct gene expression programs
are triggered involving epigenetic changes in DNA and
protein modification. However, there is evidence that
multipotent progenitor cells prime several different
lineage programs at low levels in order to respond rapidly
to external stimuli [1]. Differentiation requires both an
increase in lineage specific genes and a decrease in gene
expression associated with alternative lineages. Therefore,
dysregulation of gene expression by oncogenic mutations
can lead to lineage conversion or multilineage properties
in these primitive cells.
Activating mutations of the FLT3 receptor are
some of the most common alterations in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and have been extensively studied in
patient samples, cell lines, and model systems [2-5]. We
recently published a study describing a mouse model of
cooperation between a knock-in of a FLT3 internal tandem
duplication (ITD) mutation and a transgenic Nup98HoxD13 (NHD13) translocation [6]. While the FLT3/

and B-lymphoid progenitors [30-32]. Conversely, forced
over expression of FLT3 or FLT3 ligand in mouse bone
marrow results in decreased numbers of B220+CD19+ cells
[29, 33]. In a more physiologically relevant system, where
the FLT3/ITD mutation is expressed under the endogenous
promoter, mice develop a block in differentiation at an
early pro B-cell stage [34]. Taken together, these studies
indicate that temporal control of FLT3 expression is
critical for B-cell maturation.
Several murine models of hematopoietic
malignancy have reported leukemias that co-express
cell surface markers consistent with both myeloid and
lymphoid cells, typically using B220 as evidence of
B-cell differentiation. However, B220 appears early in
hematopoietic differentiation and can also be expressed
on many different cell types. Through sorting and
transplantation of progenitor cell populations from a
leukemic FLT3/ITD-NHD13 donor mouse, we showed
that the ability to transplant the disease was restricted
to a B220+ population with the immunophenotype of a
multipotent progenitor. However, despite expression of
B220, the leukemic initiating population was restricted to
myeloid differentiation in vitro. This population had no
other B-lymphoid properties. The cells did not display
B-cell specific transcription factor expression or any other
cell surface markers consistent with B-cell precursors.
Although this population had D-to-J rearrangements of
the IgH locus, they did not show any signs of V-to-DJ
rearrangements, which are definitive for B- lymphoid cells.
Single cell analysis of CD19- B-precursor populations in
the mouse bone marrow have shown that recombination
activating genes can be detected at low levels in most
multipotent progenitor cells, a population that retains the
capacity for myeloid differentiation. Thus, the presence
of D-to-J rearrangements and surface B220 expression
may be due to the priming of lymphoid differentiation
programs at low levels in multipotent progenitors, rather
than evidence for lymphoid differentiation.

FLT3 in normal and malignant B-cells
Although FLT3 activating mutations appear to be
primarily restricted to myeloid leukemias in patients,
wildtype FLT3 is known to be expressed in lymphoid
precursors and is expressed at low levels in nearly 100%
of B-cell ALLs, suggesting a role for the receptor in early
B-cell development [16-18]. Furthermore, subsets of ALL
associated with specific chromosomal translocations such
as MLL rearrangements have been shown to express FLT3
at high levels [19]. Although FLT3 activating mutations
occur rarely in lymphoid leukemia, they occur at a higher
frequency in subtypes of childhood leukemia such as
hyperdiploid and MLL rearranged ALL [20-21].
In contrast to what is observed in patients, many
mouse models that result in expression of FLT3 activating
mutations through retroviral transduction of bone marrow
or the generation of transgenic or “knock-in” mice have
reported leukemias that express cell surface markers
characteristic of biphenotypic or lymphoid development.
For example, transduction of bone marrow with a
FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutation results in a high
proportion of lymphoid disease [22]. The combination
of FLT3/ITD mutations with oncogenic fusions such as
MLL-SEPT6 and AML1-ETO has also yielded a subset
of mice with lymphoid disease [23-24]. In addition, a
retroviral insertional mutagenesis screen in the FLT3/
ITD knock-in background identified a high proportion of
lymphoid leukemias [25].

Regulation of FLT3 in murine B-cell development
One explanation for the development of a myeloid
disease with early B-lymphoid properties in mice is that
regulation of FLT3 expression is critical for early B-cell
maturation. Gene knock-out studies have illustrated
the importance of the balance between FLT3 and Pax5,
a transcription factor that is critical for B-lineage
commitment [26-27]. Pax5-/- pre-B cells are susceptible
to myeloid lineage switching when transduced with C/
EBP α or the GATA family of transcription factors, but
lose this ability after Pax5 induction [28]. This window
of multilineage developmental potential is associated
with FLT3 expression [29]. Holmes et al. have shown that
Pax5 deficient proB cells express high levels of FLT3, but
that it is repressed upon ectopic Pax5 expression. Further
studies in mice have shown that knock-down or over
expression of FLT3 can have a profound impact on B-cell
development. FLT3-/- mice have reduced numbers of B-cell
precursors in the bone marrow, though normal numbers of
functional B cells are present in the periphery and mice
lacking FLT3 ligand have decreased numbers of myeloid

FLT3 and B220 expression
There is previous evidence of a connection between
FLT3 signaling and the expansion of hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells (HSPCs) expressing B220. One study
identified a population of CD19-B220+c-KIT+FLT3+ cells
as early B-lymphoid precursors in juvenile mouse bone
marrow that is highly dependent on FLT3 expression
for survival [35-36]. These cells possess the potential
to produce both lymphoid and myeloid colonies in
vitro. Other studies observed that FLT3 ligand induces
the outgrowth of Mac-1+/B220+ mouse bone marrow
progenitor cells restricted to macrophage differentiation
that co-express early B-cell associated genes [37]. PreB-cell progenitors with myeloid characteristics have also
been described when murine cells are transformed with
several oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases [38]. Together,
577

these studies suggest that a population of pre-B cells with
bilineage potential exists within juvenile mice that is
dependent on FLT3 expression and highly susceptible to
transformation.
Recent work has shown that a leukemia initiating
population with lymphoid characteristics can exist in
patients with AML, suggesting that the presense of a
myeloid restricted B220 expressing cell is not a mouse
specific phenomenon [39]. In this study, CALM/AF10
positive AML samples were shown to co-express B220
and CD34, a marker used to define HSPC populations, and
had detectable clonal immunoglobulin rearrangements.
Rearrangements of the IgH locus have been observed in a
significant number of AML cases, suggesting that a larger
subset of leukemias may also be derived from a progenitor
population with lymphoid characteristics [40].

event leading to loss of the wildtype FLT3 allele allows
us to track cells originating from the leukemic initiating
population. Loss of heterozygosity is never found in
megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitors or CD19+ B-cells
populations, indicating that the leukemic initiating
population does not contribute to these lineages. These
data provide further evidence that FLT3/ITD mutations
play a role in the regulation of differentiation and lineage
restriction of the leukemic stem cell. The contribution
of both mutations to impairment in differentiation may
also explain why the concomitant expression of a Nup98
translocation and FLT3/ITD mutation results in a short
latency to disease in mice and a poor prognosis in patients.

CONCLUSION
This cumulative work suggests that regulation of
FLT3 expression is critical for both myeloid and lymphoid
differentiation. Disturbance of FLT3 through overexpression or constitutive activation by FLT3 activating
mutations can result in leukemias with promiscuous
lineage properties. While these properties may make
the cells more difficult to treat, they may also provide a
unique target for treatment since the leukemic initiating
population may express a cell surface profile distinct from
normal stem cells.

FLT3 in lineage specification
The presence of a FLT3 activating mutation can also
affect the lineage restriction of HSPCs. Although FLT3
mutations are typically categorized by their ability to
promote survival and proliferation, accumulating data has
suggested that FLT3/ITD activating mutations can also
contribute to a block in differentiation [41-42]. Radomska
et al. has shown that constitutive activation of FLT3
can inhibit CEBPα function through ERK1/2 mediated
phosphorylation, resulting in a block in differentiation in
both cell lines and patient samples. Treatment of primary
blasts with the FLT3 inhibitor CEP701 was able to
partially reverse this differentiation block, as evidenced
by increased expression of CEPBα and Pu.1 and enhanced
granulocytic differentiation. This work suggests that
signaling downstream of the constitutively activated
receptor may alter the activity of transcription factors that
are critical for myeloid differentiation.
The distribution of disease in the FLT3/ITD-NHD13
model also supports the role of FLT3 mutations in the
impairment of differentiation. Although the NHD13 alone
mice all develop a myelodysplastic syndrome, a subset
of these mice are known to progress to differentiated
leukemias of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineages [43].
These mice develop a variety of differentiated myeloid
neoplasms including acute megakaryocytic, erythroid,
and myelomonocytic leukemias. However, when this
mutation is combined with the FLT3/ITD knock-in
mutation, mice develop strictly minimally differentiated
myeloid leukemias. This difference in leukemia subtype,
suggests that the presence of a FLT3/ITD mutation in this
system results in the transformation of very early myeloid
precursors that are impaired in maturation. Accordingly,
HSPCs isolated from the FLT3/ITD-NHD13 mice showed
an impaired ability of to differentiate in vitro [Greenblatt
and Small, unpublished data], even compared to the
NHD13 or FLT3/ITD alone mice [44].
