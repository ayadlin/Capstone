ABSTRACT
Cardiac glycosides are clinically used for cardiac arrhythmias. In this study,
we investigated the mechanism responsible for anti-cancer and radiosensitizing
effects of lanatoside C in colorectal cancer cells. Lanatoside C-treated cells showed
classic patterns of autophagy, which may have been caused by lanatoside C-induced
mitochondrial aggregation or degeneration. This mitochondrial dysfunction was due
to disruption of K+ homeostasis, possibly through inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase activity.
In addition, lanatoside C sensitized HCT116 cells (but not HT-29 cells) to radiation in
vitro. γ-H2AX, a representative marker of DNA damage, were sustained longer after
combination of irradiation with lanatoside C, suggesting lanatoside C impaired DNA
damage repair processes. Recruitment of 53BP1 to damaged DNA, a critical initiation
step for DNA damage repair signaling, was significantly suppressed in lanatoside
C-treated HCT116 cells. This may have been due to defects in the RNF8- and RNF168dependent degradation of KDM4A/JMJD2A that increases 53BP1 recruitment to DNA
damage sites. Although lanatoside C alone reduced tumor growth in the mouse
xenograft tumor model, combination of lanatoside C and radiation inhibited tumor
growth more than single treatments. Thus, lanatoside C could be a potential molecule
for anti-cancer drugs and radiosensitizing agents.

isoforms of the subunits that makeup the Na+/K+-ATPase,
these cells may be sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of
cardiac glycosides [5]. Several studies have reported that
cardiac glycosides exert several anti-tumor mechanisms,
including inhibition of proliferation, induction of
apoptosis, and sensitization to chemotherapy, supporting
their potential use for cancer therapy [6–8].
Mitochondria supply energy to the cell and are
important mediators of apoptosis. Several compounds that
destabilize mitochondrial function and cause apoptosis
have been identified recently, suggesting mitochondria
may be potential targets for anti-cancer drugs. Each type of
cancer is complex and caused by different DNA mutations,

INTRODUCTION
Cardiac glycosides are a large family of naturally
derived compounds that contain a steroid nucleus with
five- or six-membered lactone ring and sugar moieties.
These compounds inhibit the plasma membrane Na+/
K+-ATPase and are clinically used to treat arrhythmia
and heart failure. Cardiac glycosides suppress the active
counter-transport of Na+ and K+ across the cell membrane,
which leads to an increase in intracellular [Na+] and a
decrease in intracellular [K+] [1]. Recently, many studies
have suggested that cardiac glycosides target cancer
cells [2–5]. Because human cancer cells tend to express

indicating that cancer treatment with a drug that targets only
a few gene products or single pathway is difficult. However,
mutations in the mitochondrial genome are very rare, and
compounds that target mitochondria may be efficient drugs
for treatment of multiple types of cancers [9].
In the present study, we showed that lanatoside C
sensitized colorectal cancer cells to radiation in vitro and
in a mouse xenograft model. Moreover, lanatoside C alone
suppressed proliferation of colorectal cancer cells through
an apoptosis-independent manner by inducing mitochondrial
dysfunction. Activation of these alternative cell death
pathways by lanatoside C may be a useful strategy to treat
cancer cells that are resistant to apoptosis and may be further
exploited for the development of novel cancer therapies.

cytosol to newly formed autophagosomes, which appear
as cytoplasmic puncta [12]. GFP-LC3-expressing HCT116
cells were incubated in media containing lanatoside
C for 48 h. To quantify the autophagy, the number of
GFP-LC3 puncta in a cell was measured (Figure 2C).
Lanatoside C-treated cells showed significant induction
of GFP-LC3 puncta formation. All these results suggested
that lanatoside C induced autophagosome formation
in colorectal cancer cells. In order to know whether
these changes in autophagic flux is due to activation of
autophagy or inhibition of autophagosomal degradation,
bafilomycin A1 was pre-treated. As LC3-II conversion
and p62 accumulation was not further increased by
lanatoside C in the presence of bafilomycin A1, lanatoside
C impaired autophagosomal degradation (Figure 2D).

RESULTS

Autophagy induction by lanatoside C was
dependent on Erk and JNK MAP kinases

Lanatoside C inhibited the proliferation of
colorectal cancer cells

Because previous reports show that autophagy
is regulated by MAP kinase [13–15], we investigated
whether lanatoside C activated MAP kinases. Of three
MAPKs, phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and JNK1/2 peaked
after 4 h incubation with lanatoside C and decreased
thereafter. In contrast, phosphorylation of p38 increased
continuously in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3A). To
reveal whether MAP kinases were involved in autophagy
induction by lanatoside C, we investigated levels of
LC3-II after transfection with siRNA against Erk1/2,
JNK1/2 or p38. Lanatoside C-induced LC3-II conversion
was decreased significantly in the Erk1/2 or JNK1/2suppressed cells (Figure 3C and 3D). In accordance with
this, pretreatment with 10 µM U-0126, an inhibitor of
Erk1/2, completely blocked autophagic process induced
by lanatoside C (Figure 3B). However, p38 knockdown
did not affect LC3-II conversion (data not shown). All
these results suggest that lanatoside C induced autophagy
via Erk1/2 and JNK1/2 activation.
To investigate whether anti-cancer effect of
lanatoside C is mediated by autophagy, essential genes
in autophagosome formation were knockdown. Although
LC3-II conversion by lanatoside C was blocked by the
transfection with ATG5 or Beclin1 siRNA (Supplementary
Figure S2A), cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure
S2B) and clonogenic cell survival (Supplementary Figure
S2C) were not changed with suppression of autophagy.
Thus, induction of autophagy does not seem to be a main
mechanism of anti-cancer effect of lanatoside C.

Because cardiac glycosides selectively inhibit growth
of some malignant cells [10], we first examined the effects
of lanatoside C on the proliferation of human colorectal
cancer cell lines. Similar to the findings in other types of
cancers, lanatoside C significantly inhibited growth of the
HCT116 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cell lines (Figure 1A).
Because cytotoxicity of conventional anti-cancer drugs
is typically due to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis [11],
we investigated whether cell cycle arrest or apoptosis
contributed to the response to lanatoside C. Supplementary
Figure S1 shows that lanatoside C accumulated cells at the
G2/M phase of the cell cycle in both cell lines. Cytotoxic
effect of lanatoside C was not significant. Propidium iodide
positive population was only 10 % and apoptosis markers
like cleavage of PARP-1 or caspase 3 was not induced
significantly (data not shown). However, as shown in Figure
1B, lanatoside C reduced colony-forming efficiency of
both colorectal cancer cell lines, suggesting that lanatoside
C caused a replication-dependent cell death instead of
physiological cell death. Microscopic observations revealed
that lanatoside C induced vacuole formation in HCT116
cells (arrowhead), and the number of vacuoles increased in
a time-dependent manner (Figure 1C).

Lanatoside C induced autophagy in colorectal
cancer cells
To determine whether vacuole formation was
mediated by autophagy, we measured conversion of
autophagosome protein LC3-I to LC3-II using western
blot analysis. Lanatoside C induced LC3-II form in a doseand time-dependent manner in both cell lines (Figure
2A and 2B). Another autophagic marker protein, p62/
sequestosome 1 (SQTM1), was also induced by lanatoside
C treatment. Autophagy induction is often monitored by
an assay that depends on translocation of LC3 from the

Lanatoside C induced mitochondrial dysfunction
in colorectal cancer cells
Recent reports show that mitochondria contribute to
apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, and mitoptosis has been
shown to activate autophagy [16]. To investigate effects
of lanatoside C on mitochondrial function, we observed

Coincide with this result, DASPMI staining showed that
lanatoside C decreased mitochondrial membrane potential to
49.8 ± 1.4% (Figure 4C).
To verify the effect of lanatoside C on cellular
respiration in colorectal cancer cells, we assessed oxygen
consumption rate (OCR). To measure maximal oxidative
capacity, oligomycin was injected into culture wells prior
to injection of the uncoupling agent FCCP. Lanatoside
C consistently decreased basal OCR even after 3 h
incubation. Lanatoside C decreased oxidative capacity
to 68.6 ± 6.7% that of control-treated cells (Figure 4D),
suggesting that lanatoside C depolarized the mitochondrial
membrane potential and inhibited mitochondrial function.

intracellular Na+ accumulation. KCl decreased lanatoside
C-mediated cytotoxicity in both cell lines (Figure 4E).
Mitochondrial membrane potential in KCl-treated
HCT116 cells was approximately 74% of untreated cells.
In the presence of lanatoside C, treatment with KCl
recovered mitochondrial membrane potential from 41%
to 63% of that of untreated cells (Figure 4F).
To determine the signaling between mitochondrial
dysfunction and autophagy, mitochondrial membrane
potential was checked in MAPKs inhibited cells.
Erk1/2 or JNK1/2 knockdown via siRNA transfection
or pretreatment with Erk inhibitor (U-0126) or JNK
inhibitor (SP600125) did not recover lanatoside
C-mediated reduction of mitochondrial membrane
potential (Supplementary Figure S3A). Conversely, KCl
pretreatment suppressed lanatoside C-induced activation
of Erk1/2 and JNK1/2 (data not shown) and GFP-LC3
puncta formation (Supplementary Figure S3B). These data
suggested that lanatoside C-induced depolarization of the
mitochondrial membrane may be mediated by increased
intracellular [Na+], followed by activation of Erk1/2 and
JNK1/2 and progression of autophagy.

Lanatoside C induced mitochondrial dysfunction
by disrupting K+ homeostasis
Cardiac glycosides exert their effect by inhibiting
the Na+/K+-ATPase, elevating intracellular [Na+] and
depleting intracellular [K+][17]. To determine whether an
increase of intracellular [Na+] by lanatoside C mediates
growth inhibition, we pretreated 25 µM KCl to suppress

Lanatoside C increased radiosensitivity by
suppressing DNA damage repair

antibodies against 53BP1, phospho-ATM (S1981),
and mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1
(MDC1). Foci formation of γ-H2AX after irradiation
was further increased in the cells pretreated with 0.5 µM
lanatoside C. However, IR-mediated foci formation of
53BP1 were almost completely blocked by lanatoside
C combination. Although the number of phospho-ATM
foci was also slightly decreased, MDC1 foci formation
was not affected by lanatoside C treatment (Figure 6A).
To confirm this result, HCT116 cells were biochemically
fractionated and protein retention on damaged DNA sites
was investigated. As shown in Figure 6B, 53BP1 was
recruited chromatin fraction (P2) after irradiation, which
was blocked by lanatoside C pretreatment. PhosphoATM level in chromatin fraction was also decrease
but other molecules did not affected by lanatoside C
treatment. As total phospho-ATM was slightly increased
in whole cell extract (Supplementary Figure S4B),
binding of phospho-ATM to chromatin could be affected
by lanatoside C.
Recent studies show that formation of 53BP1 foci
is dependent on RNF8- and RNF168-mediated JMJD2A
ubiquitination and degradation at the damaged DNA
sites [18]. To determine whether lanatoside C-dependent
suppression of 53BP1 foci formation was related
to JMJD2A, we examined 53BP1 foci formation in
JMJD2A-knockdown cells after irradiation. As shown
in Figure 6C, JMJD2A suppression restored 53BP1 foci
formation which was inhibited by lanatoside C (yellow
foci). Colocalization of 53BP1 and γ-H2AX foci was
confirmed by analysis of fluorescence peak distance from
images (Supplementary Figure S4C, right panel). RNF8
and RNF168 also ubiquitinated histone H2A at Lys1315 and Lys119 following generation of DSBs, which is
followed by recruitment of BRCA1 or 53BP1 [19, 20]. We
investigated the interaction between RNF168 and H2AX
and confirmed ubiquitination of γ-H2AX using in situ
proximity ligation assays (PLAs). Lanatoside C eliminated
the irradiation-induced interaction between RNF168 and
H2AX and reduced ubiquitination of H2AX (Figure 6D
and Supplementary Figure S5). These results suggested
that lanatoside C-mediated inhibition of RNF8 or RNF168
may contribute to prevention of 53BP1 foci formation by
reducing JMJD2A ubiquitination/degradation and histone
ubiquitination in the damaged DNA region.

During the screening of DNA damage response
modulator, lanatoside C has been identified as an inhibitor
of doxorubicin-induced p53-dependent transcription
activation (unpublished result). So, we investigated
whether lanatoside C enhanced radiosensitivity of
colorectal cancer cells. HCT116 and HT-29 cells were
exposed to 0.2 µM lanatoside C for 16 h, followed by
γ-irradiation. Eight hours after irradiation, lanatoside C
was removed and cells were incubated for an additional
10-14 days and assessed for colony formation. Radiation
dose-response curves for lanatoside C plus radiation,
which were normalized to account for the cytotoxicity of
lanatoside C alone, are shown in Figure 5A and 5B. When
combined with radiation, lanatoside C strongly increased
radiosensitivity of HCT116, but not of HT-29 cells.
Next, we investigated whether lanatoside C
affected the generation and/or elimination of radiationinduced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by measuring
γ-H2AX protein level and foci formation. Combination of
lanatoside C and radiation generated more DNA damage
than single treatments (Figure 5C & 5D, lane 5), which
appeared to have a more pronounced effect in HCT116
cells than in HT-29 cells. After 8 h, radiation-induced
increase in γ-H2AX level were sustained in the irradiated
HCT116 cells pretreated with lanatoside C (Figure 5C,
lane 8), suggesting that lanatoside C suppressed DNA
damage repair. However, lanatoside C did not inhibit DNA
damage repair in HT-29 cells (Figure 5D). As shown in
Figure 5E, irradiation-induced γ-H2AX foci were also
maintained in lanatoside C-treated HCT116 cells after 8
and 24 h. These results indicated that the radiosensitizing
effect of lanatoside C in HCT116 cells was mediated by
amplification of DNA damage and suppression of DNA
damage repair.

Lanatoside C inhibited recruitment of 53BP1 to
the DNA damage sites through suppression of
RNF168 activity
To reveal the mechanism of lanatoside C
regulating DNA damage response, we first checked
DNA damage response signaling by western blotting.
As shown in Supplementary Figure S4A, radiationinduced phosphorylation of H2AX was dramatically
increased depending on the concentration of lanatoside
C, but the phosphorylation of other signal molecules
such ATM and Chk2 was not significantly increased.
And it is worth noting that 0.5 µM lanatoside C in
combination with radiation depleted p53, p21 and Chk1
proteins (lane 6).
As many proteins regulating DNA damage
response are known to form foci at the damaged DNA,
we next performed immunofluorescence staining with

Lanatoside C enhanced radiation-induced tumor
growth delay in vivo
To confirm the radiosensitizing effects of lanatoside
C in vivo, we generated mouse xenograft models via
inoculation with HCT116 or HT-29 cells. Tumor growth
was measured after administration of γ-irradiation with or
without lanatoside C. In the xenograft model generated
with HCT116 cells, irradiation alone inhibited tumor
growth by 44.92 ± 5.15% and irradiation plus lanatoside

inhibited by 21.45 ± 6.64% with irradiation alone and
41.31 ± 6.84% with lanatoside C plus irradiation on day

DISCUSSION

of H2AX causes recruitment of downstream factors,
such as the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168,
leading to the formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin
chains on histones at DSBs. This ubiquitination cascade
is responsible for the localization of repair mediators,
such as 53BP1 and BRCA1, to sites of DNA damage
[19, 20, 25–27]. Localization of 53BP1 to DSBs involves
recognition of H2A ubiquitination at Lys15 and requires
dimethylation of histone H4 on Lys20 (H4K20me2) via
the 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain [28, 29]. In this study,
lanatoside C suppressed the formation of radiationinduced 53BP1 foci (Figure 6A) and retention at the sites
of DNA damage (Figure 6B). Mallette et al. [19] shows
that the Tudor domain containing lysine demethylases
JMJD2A and JMJD2B, which bind to H4K20me2,
becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded in response to
DNA damage and that this process requires E3 ligase

The current study demonstrated that treatment with
lanatoside C led to dose-dependent cytostatic or cytotoxic
responses in two colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116
and HT-29. However, lanatoside C strongly enhanced the
radiosensitivity of HCT116 but not HT-29 cells in vitro.
As cells are most radiosensitive in the M and G2 phases
[21], cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase by lanatoside C
in HCT-116 cell could be responsible for the difference
in radiosensitization (Supplementary Figure S1). Not only
this, lanatoside C increased cell sensitivity to radiation
by inhibiting DNA damage repair (Figure 5C) in HCT116 cell, as has been reported for other cardiac glycosides
including bufalin, ouabain, and huachansu [22–24].
Induction of DNA DSBs triggers a cascade of
protein modification and relocalization. Phosphorylation

activity of both RNF8 and RNF168. We demonstrated
that knockdown of JMJD2A significantly increased the
formation of 53BP1 foci in lanatoside C-treated cells
(Figure 6C) and lanatoside C dramatically reduced
RNF168-mediated H2AX ubiquitination (Figure 6D).
Thus, we suggested that the lanatoside C-induced
radiosensitizing effect is mediated by suppression
of the RNF8/RNF168-mediated JMJD2A or H2AX
ubiquitination, which required for 53BP1 recruitment and
DNA damage repair.
Autophagy is characterized by the presence of
cytoplasmic vesicles and is involved in a variety of
cellular functions, including development, nutrient sensing
responses, and cell death [30]. Importantly, autophagy has
become a vital mechanism for anti-cancer treatments [31,
32]. A recent study shows that many cardiac glycosides
induce autophagy in human non-small lung cancer cells
through activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) pathway and Erk1/2 activation, which leads
to autophagic cell death [33]. In our study, lanatoside
C also induced autophagy through activation of Erk1/2
and JNK1/2 signaling (Figure 2 and 3). However,
suppression of autophagy by depletion of Atg5 and
Beclin 1 (key regulators of autophagy) could not reduce
lanatoside C-mediated growth inhibition (Supplementary
Figure S2). Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
(MtMP) is another major determinant of cell death, and
we found a significant decrease in MtMP in lanatoside
C-treated colorectal cancer cells (Figure 4). Badr et
al. also shows that lanatoside C causes loss of MtMP
and decreases intracellular ATP levels as early as 2 h
after treatment in glioblastoma cell lines. They suggest
that lanatoside C-induced autophagy is triggered by a
decrease in MtMP followed by early depletion of ATP
[34]. Similarly, lanatoside C resulted in loss of MtMP
and induction of autophagy in colorectal cancer cell lines,
and disruption of K+ homeostasis by inhibition of Na+/
K+-ATPase activity was a key factor in the induction of
depolarization of mitochondria. As damaged mitochondria
becomes autophagosomes or mitopototic bodies, which
are degraded through mitoptosis [16], we speculated that
autophagic process induced by lanatoside C might be
induced to eliminate the damaged mitochondria.

were analyzed using CellQuestTM Pro software (BD
Biosciences).

Autophagy assays
For quantitative analysis of fluorescenct
autophagosome, GFP-LC3-expressing HCT-116 cell was
established by infecting retrovirus made with pBABEpuro
GFP-LC3 (a gift from Jayanta Debnath, Addgene plasmid
# 22405). After 48 h incubation with 0.5 µM lanatoside
C, the percentage of GFP-LC3 positive cells with GFPpuncta was assessed by counting a minimum of 100 cells
with fluorescence microscopy (Axio Observer D1; Carl
Zeiss MicroImaging, Jena, Germany).

Annexin V staining
After 24 h treatment with lanatoside C, cells were
harvested by trypsinization and apoptotic cells were
detected using Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit
(Biovision, Milpitas, CA, USA) by flow cytometry.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and reagents

Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cancer
cell lines HCT116 and HT-29 were obtained from
the Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB, Seoul, Korea).
All cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
(WELGENE Inc., Daegu, Korea) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Omega
Scientific, Inc., Tarzana, CA, USA) and 100 U/ml
penicillin/streptomycin. Lanatoside C and bafilomycin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HCT116 cells and HT-29 cells were treated
with lanatoside C for 3 h, followed by staining with
10 µM DASPMI for 30 min. Cells were harvested by
trypsinization and suspension in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) containing 10 µM D-Glucose. Mitochondrial
membrane potential was analyzed by flow cytometry.

30 min and changes in mitochondrial morphologies and
mitochondrial membrane potential were observed.

ice for 10 and 5 min, respectively. Cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.5%
Triton X-100 for 10 min. Intact cells were fixed without
extraction and blocked in PBS containing 10% FBS for 30
min. Cells were incubated with antibodies against γ-H2AX
(Ser139), phospho-ATM (Ser1981), MDC1 (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA), and 53BP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
overnight at 4°C and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for
1 h at room temperature. After counterstaining with 4',
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), immunofluorescence
images were captured with a laser-scanning confocal
microscope (LSM710; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging).

Measurement of oxygen consumption rate
Rates of oxygen consumption (OCR) were measured
using an Extracellular Flux Analyzer (XF-24, Seahorse
Biosciences, North Billerica, MA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded into
24-well plates (4×104 cells/well) and cultured overnight
in RPMI media with 10% FBS. Cells were washed with
media and treated with the indicated dose of lanatoside C
for 3 h. Cells were washed with Seahorse assay media (1
µM pyruvate, 25 µM glucose) and incubated in the same
media for 1 h at 37°C without CO2. Cells were loaded onto
the XF-24 analyzer to measure OCR in short and repeated
intervals. Baseline cellular OCR was measured, followed
by ATP-linked respiration in the presence of oligomycin (1
μg/ml). Next, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazon (FCCP) (1 μM) was added to measure maximal
respiratory capacity. Lastly, antimycin A (2 μM), an
inhibitor of complex III and I, was added to block function
of the electron transport chain. Mixing, waiting, and
measuring times were 3, 2, and 3 min, respectively.

Western blot analysis
Western blot was performed following a standard
protocol. Antibodies were obtained as follow; p53, p21,
Chk1, p62, PARP-1, β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
phospho-p53 (Ser15), phospho-Chk2 (Thr68), phosphoErk1/2, Erk1/2, phospho-JNK, JNK1/2, phospho-p38,
p38, Caspase 3, H2AX (Cell Signaling Technology),
phospho-ATM (Ser1981), Chk2, γ-H2AX (Ser139)
(Millipore), ATM (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA),
and LC3 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA).
Chemiluminescence was detected using enhanced
chemiluminescence detection reagents.

Irradiation

Biochemical fractionation

γ-radiation was delivered using a dual-source 137Cs
unit at a dose rate of 3.2 Gy/min with a GC-3000 Elan
irradiator (MDS Nordion, Canada).

Biochemical fractionation was performed with
slight modifications [35]. Briefly, the cells were washed
twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested. Cell pellets were
resuspended for 15 min on ice in 200 µl extraction buffer
[50 µM HEPES (pH7.5), 150 µM NaCl, 1 µM EDTA]
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors.
Following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 3 min, the
supernatant was collected (S1), and pellets were further
extracted for 15 min on ice using the same buffer and
collected. The pellets were further incubated in 200 µl
of extraction buffer without Triton X-100 supplemented
with 200 µg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 25°C. Following
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 3 min, the supernatant
was separated from the pellet. The pellet was resuspended
in PBS buffer supplemented with 1% SDS, boiled for
10 min, and sonicated for 10 sec (Q500, Qsonica, LLC,
Newtown, CT, USA) (P2). S1 and P2 fractions were
used for western blot analysis with antibodies against
53BP1, BRCA1, NBS1, MRE11, α-tubulin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), phospho-ATM (Ser1981), and γ-H2AX.

Clonogenic cell survival assay
Cells were seeded into 60-µm culture plates (2×102
– 3×103 cells/plate) and allowed to attach for 24 h prior
to treatment. Cells were treated with DMSO or 0.2 µM
lanatoside C for 16 h, followed by γ-irradiation. After
10-14 days of incubation, colonies were fixed with icecold methanol and stained with 0.4% crystal violet in
20% ethanol. The colonies with more than 50 cells were
counted. The survival fraction was calculated as followed:
Survival fraction = colonies counted / (cell seeded ×
plating efficiency / 100). Cell survival was normalized
against cytotoxicity induced by lanatoside C and results
were from at least three independent experiments.

In situ extraction and immunofluorescence
Cells were cultured on 18×18-mm cover glasses, and
cell extraction was performed with a slight modification
of a previous report [35]. Cells were extracted in situ by
incubating the cover glasses in fractionation buffer [50 µM
HEPES (pH7.5), 150 µM NaCl, 1 µM EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet
P-40] for 20 min on ice. The buffer was removed, and the
procedure was repeated for two additional incubations on

(5′-GCUCAGUAUCAGAGAGAAUUU-3′), and JMJD2A
(5′-GUAUGAUCUU CCAGACUUAUU-3′). Cells in 60mm culture plates were transfected with 20 nM siRNA
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated according to the
following formula: length×width2×0.523.

In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In situ PLA was performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala,
Sweden). Briefly, cells cultured on 18×18-mm cover
glasses were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min,
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and
blocked at 37°C for 30 min. Co-incubations with antiRNF168 (Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA) and anti-H2AX or
with anti-Ub-H2AX (K119) (Cell Signaling Technology)
and anti-γ-H2AX (Millipore) were performed overnight
at 4°C. After removal of unbound primary antibodies,
cells were incubated with proximity probes (anti-rabbit
PLUS and anti-mouse MINUS) (Olink Bioscience) for 1
h at 37°C. Ligation was performed for 30 min at 37°C,
followed by polymerization for 2 h at 37°C. The cells
were counterstained with DAPI, and immunofluorescence
images were captured with a laser-scanning confocal
microscope.

Colorectal cancer xenograft studies
Male 4-week-old Balb/c nude mice were used
for this study. Animals were maintained at animal care
facilities, and food and water were supplied ad libitum.
Studies were conducted under guidelines for the use
and care of laboratory animals and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Korea
Institute Radiological and Medical Sciences. Tumors were
generated by subcutaneous injection of 1×106 cells into the
right hind leg of Balb/c nude mice. When tumors reached
a mean diameter of 7.5-8 mm, mice (n = 6 per group)
were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental
groups. Radiation treatment was administered when
the tumors had grown to a mean diameter of 7.5-8 mm
(which represented Day 0). The tumor-bearing legs were
treated with a single dose of 8 Gy using Theratron 780
(AECL, Ontario, ON, Canada). When tumors were a mean
diameter of 7.5-8 mm, PBS or 6 mg/kg of lanatoside C
were injected intraperitoneally one time per day for five
days. In the radiation plus lanatoside C group, lanatoside
C was administered 6 h following radiation (Day 0).
Tumor growth was assessed by regular measurement of
orthogonal tumor diameter until the diameter reached at
least 20 mm. The length and width of tumor sizes were
determined two or three times per week with calipers.
