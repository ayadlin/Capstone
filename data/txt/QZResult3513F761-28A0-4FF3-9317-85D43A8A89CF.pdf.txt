Abstract
Activation of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (cdk4/6) occurs in the majority of glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) tumors, and represents a promising molecular target for the development of small molecule inhibitors.
In the current study, we investigated the molecular determinants and in vivo response of diverse GBM cell
lines and xenografts to PD-0332991, a cdk4/6-specific inhibitor. In vitro testing of PD-0332991 against a panel
of GBM cell lines revealed a potent G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of senescence in each of 16 retinoblastoma protein (Rb)–proficient cell lines regardless of other genetic lesions, whereas 5 cell lines with homozygous inactivation of Rb were completely resistant to treatment. Short hairpin RNA depletion of Rb expression
conferred resistance of GBM cells to PD-0332991, further demonstrating a requirement of Rb for sensitivity to
cdk4/6 inhibition. PD-0332991 was found to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier and proved highly effective in suppressing the growth of intracranial GBM xenograft tumors, including those that had recurred after
initial therapy with temozolomide. Remarkably, no mice receiving PD-0332991 died as a result of disease progression while on therapy. Additionally, the combination of PD-0332991 and radiation therapy resulted in significantly increased survival benefit compared with either therapy alone. In total, our results support clinical
trial evaluation of PD-0332991 against newly diagnosed as well as recurrent GBM, and indicate that Rb status
is the primary determinant of potential benefit from this therapy. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3228–38. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Deregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6
(cdk4/6)–cyclin D-INK4—retinoblastoma protein (Rb) signaling pathway is among the most common aberrations found
in human cancer (1). In the case of glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM), this pathway is most commonly altered by homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B, and less commonly by deletion/
mutation of CDKN2C and RB1, or genomic amplification of

CDK4, CDK6, and individual D-type cyclins (2–8). Recent molecular profiling of GBM has further highlighted the critical
role of cdk4/6 activation in the pathogenesis of this devastating tumor (9, 10).
Despite the ubiquitous nature of cdk4/6 activation in
human cancer, surprisingly little work has been reported
describing efforts to target activated cdk4/6 with pharmacologic inhibitors. This is due to the difficulty of identifying inhibitors specific to cdk4/6, and also because cdk inhibition is
predicted to be cytostatic (not cytotoxic), and therefore of
uncertain therapeutic utility (11).
PD-0332991 is a recently developed cdk4/6-specific inhibitor. Initial reports detailed the synthesis of this pyridopyrimidine derivative, showed its in vitro specificity against
cdk4/6, and documented its potent antiproliferative activity
against Rb-proficient subcutaneous human tumor xenografts
(12, 13). A large phase I study of this compound is ongoing
and has already shown clinical efficacy against otherwise
untreatable teratomas (14). Additional xenograft studies
modeling disseminated multiple myeloma (15) and breast
carcinoma (16) helped to motivate recently initiated phase
I/II clinical trials testing PD-0332991 against these cancers
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).
Given its effectiveness in a variety of tumor types and its
specificity for activated cdk4/6, we hypothesized that PD0332991 could be useful in the treatment of GBM. To evaluate
this, PD-0332991 was initially tested in vitro against a panel of

PD-0332991 Arrests the Growth of GBM Intracranial Xenografts

21 human GBM cell lines of defined genetic backgrounds.
Next, its activity was assayed in vivo against three different
GBM intracranial xenografts using a luciferase reporter to
allow longitudinal monitoring of tumor growth and response
to therapy. Finally, PD-0332991 was tested in combination
with ionizing radiation against intracranial xenografts, as well
as in tumors that had recurred following initial therapy with
temozolomide, an alkylating agent routinely used in upfront
treatment of GBM (17). Our findings show that PD-0332991
crosses the blood-brain barrier and works effectively both
as a single agent and in combination with radiation to suppress the growth of all Rb-proficient GBM cells and tumors
tested.

Materials and Methods
GBM cell lines and xenografts. A panel of 21 GBM cell
lines was obtained directly from the American Type Culture
Collection (U87MG, U138MG, M059J, Hs683, H4, A172, LN18,
LN229, CCF-STTG1, T98G, and DBTRG-05MG), DSMZ
(8MGBA, 42MGBA, DKMG, GAMG, GMS10, LN405, and
SNB19), and the Japan Health Sciences Foundation Health
Science Research Resources Bank (AM38, NMC-G1, and
KG-1-C). These repositories authenticate all human cell lines
prior to accession by DNA fingerprinting, and independent
evidence of authenticity is also provided by cytogenetic and
immunophenotypic tests. All experiments were performed
on cell lines that had been passaged for <6 mo after receipt.
Cell line SF767 was established from a GBM at the University
of California, San Francisco Brain Tumor Research Center,
and has been previously genotyped for CDKN2A, TP53, and
PTEN status (18). All cell lines were grown in DMEM + 10%
fetal bovine serum at 37°C in 5% CO2. GBM 39 is a human
GBM primary xenograft maintained as a subcutaneous heterotransplant in athymic mice, as previously described (19).
Western blot. Total cell lysate was collected from asynchronously proliferating cells in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted using standard techniques. Primary antibodies used
were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Mdm2, clone
SMP14), Cell Signaling (cyclin D1, clone DCS6; cyclin D3,
clone DCS22; cdk4, clone DCS156; cdk6, clone DCS83;
p18INK4c, clone DCS118; p21WAF1/CIP1, clone DCS60;
p14ARF, clone 4C6/4; Rb, clone 4H1), BD PharMingen
(p16INK4a, no. 554079), NeoMarkers (α-tubulin, Ab-1 clone
DM1A; EGFR, Ab-12), Calbiochem (p53, Ab-6 clone DO-1),
and Cascade Bioscience (PTEN, clone 6H2.1).
Flow cytometry. Cells were pulsed with 10 μmol/L of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 1 h, trypsinized, and then
centrifuged. Cells were fixed and stained using the BrdU Flow
Kit (PharMingen), counterstained with propidium iodide,
and analyzed by flow cytometry in a BD FACSort instrument
using FCS Express v.3 software (DeNovo Software).
β-Galactosidase staining. Cells grown on coverslips were
stained with the Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining Kit
(Cell Signaling) as described by the manufacturer.
Microscopy. Imaging was performed on an Olympus BX61
light microscope with Plan-Apochromat objectives.

Rb knockdown. Five unique short hairpin RNAs (shRNA)
to the RB1 mRNA in the pLKO.1-Puro lentiviral expression
vector were obtained from Open Biosystems. To make the
virus, empty pLKO.1-Puro or each of these five shRNA clones
were cotransfected into 293T cells with pVSV-G (Addgene)
and pHR′-CMV-8.2ΔR (Addgene) helper plasmids using
Fugene 6 (Roche). Virus-containing conditioned medium
was harvested 48 h after transfection, filtered, and used to infect recipient cells in the presence of 8 μg/mL of polybrene.
Infected cells were selected with 2 μg/mL of puromycin until
all mock-infected cells were dead and then maintained in
0.2 μg/mL of puromycin.
Generation and therapy of mice with intracranial GBM
xenograft tumors. All intracranial therapy response experiments involved the use of 5- to 6-week-old female athymic
mice (nu/nu genotype, BALB/c background; Simonsen Laboratories). Animals were housed and fed under aseptic conditions, and all animal research was approved by The
University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Procedures used for intracranial
tumor establishment, including monitoring of tumor growth
and response to therapy by bioluminescence imaging, have
previously been described (20). Treatments for the experiments reported here were as follows: oral administration
of vehicle only for control groups [50 mmol/L sodium
lactate (pH 4), for PD-0332991, and/or OraPlus for temozolomide], oral administration of PD-0332991 (Pfizer) at
150 mg/kg/d, clinical grade temozolomide (Schering-Plough)
at 10 mg/kg/d, and radiation at 2 Gy/d from a Cesium-137
source (J.L. Shepherd & Associates).
Brain tumor analysis. PD-0332991 concentrations in
mouse brain or brain tumor were determined using a liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
method following liquid-liquid extraction. Brain or brain tumor samples were homogenized with purified water at 1:4
dilution (w/v). A 100 μL aliquot of the homogenate was used
for liquid-liquid extraction with the addition of 100 μL of
potassium bicarbonate buffer, 10 μL of the stable labeled internal standard, and 0.4 mL of methyl tert-butyl ether. Following centrifugation, the organic layer was evaporated to
dryness and reconstituted in 100 μL of methanol for LCMS/MS analysis. The LC system (Shimadzu) was coupled
to an MDS Sciex API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, and operated in the positive ionization mode using a
multiple reaction source. PD-0332991 and internal standard
were monitored using specific precursor ion → product ion
transitions of m/z 448 → 380 and m/z 451 → 383, respectively.
The final concentration of PD-0332991 was normalized based
on the weight of mouse brain or brain tumor collected.

panel of 21 GBM cell lines. This analysis showed genetic
lesions in at least one component of the cdk4/6-cyclin DINK4-Rb signaling pathway in each cell line, without exception
(Table 1). Fifteen of the cell lines have homozygous deletions
of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, five have homozygous deletions or
mutations of RB1 (resulting in a lack of detectable Rb protein), four have homozygous deletions of CDKN2C, and one
(CCF-STTG1) harbors amplifications of both CDK6 and
CCND3, with high levels of expression of corresponding encoded proteins (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S1). Lesions of
CDKN2A/B, RB1, and CDK6/CCND3 were mutually exclusive

Rb protein. In contrast, homozygous deletion of CDKN2C
occurred exclusively in cell lines also harboring homozygous deletions of CDKN2A/B. A number of additional genetic
lesions in other signaling pathways were identified among
the cell lines, including PTEN deletion and mutation, TP53
mutation, BRAF mutation, EGFR rearrangement, and MDM2
amplification (Supplementary Table S1). However, no concordance was detected between any of these other genetic
lesions and lesions of cdk4/6-cyclin D-INK4-Rb signaling
pathway genes.

cycle distribution was assessed by BrdUrd incorporation and
flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary
Fig. S2). In 16 of 21 cell lines, PD-0332991 treatment significantly inhibited BrdUrd incorporation and resulted in an increased fraction of cells in G 1 phase of the cell cycle

compared with vehicle alone (Table 1). Although some cell
lines displayed a >95% reduction in BrdUrd incorporation after treatment with 1 μmol/L of PD-0332991 for 48 hours (e.g.,
A172, CCF-STTG1, DBTRG-05MG, DKMG, Hs683, KG-1-C,
NMC-G1, SNB19, and U87MG), others displayed a more intermediate response (e.g., AM38, GAMG, H4, and LN18). Of note,
5 of 21 of these cell lines displayed no difference in cell cycle
distribution between treatment with vehicle or 1 μmol/L of
PD-0332991 (8MGBA, 42MGBA, GMS10, LN405, and M059J).
Remarkably, each of the five resistant cell lines harbors homozygous deletion or mutation of the RB1 gene that results in the
absence of detectable Rb protein (see Supplementary Fig. S1).
To further explore the differential sensitivity of GBM cell
lines to PD-0332991, the 21 cell lines were next cultured in
the presence of 0, 1, 2, or 10 μmol/L of PD-0332991, and cell
cycle distribution was again assessed at 48 hours posttreatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). Cells that initially displayed
>95% reduction in BrdUrd incorporation at 1 μmol/L showed
similar inhibition at doses of 2 and 10 μmol/L PD-0332991,
and without evidence of apoptosis or cytotoxicity (i.e., floating
cell debris or sub-G1 DNA content) at any dose (data not
shown). Importantly, Rb-proficient cells that displayed intermediate reductions in BrdUrd incorporation at 1 μmol/L PD0332991 displayed increased reductions when incubated with
2 and 10 μmol/L of PD-0332991. For example, GAMG cells displayed a 53% reduction in BrdUrd incorporation at 1 μmol/L
PD-0332991, but had 78% and 96% reductions at 2 and 10
μmol/L, respectively. In contrast, the five Rb-deficient cell
lines displayed no reduction in BrdUrd incorporation or alterations in cell cycle distribution at any of the doses tested.
We next examined the effects of long-term culture in
the presence of PD-0332991. Microscopic analysis of Rbproficient GBM cells treated with 1 μmol/L of PD-0332991
for 7 days revealed not only sustained growth arrest, but also
morphologic changes characteristic of cells that have exited
the cell cycle and entered a senescent-like state (i.e., large
and flat: Fig. 1C). Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity was evident in Rb-proficient GBM cells after 14 days of
treatment with PD-0332991 (Fig. 1D). However, Rb-deficient
cells did not display these morphologic and senescent-like
changes (Fig. 1C and D). Together, these findings indicate
that PD-0332991 potently induces G 1 cell cycle arrest of
GBM cells at doses of <1 to 10 μmol/L, and that sustained
treatment induces cellular senescence in Rb-proficient cells.
Stable depletion of Rb expression alleviates the growth
arrest induced by PD-0332991. To unequivocally determine

PD-0332991 Arrests the Growth of GBM Intracranial Xenografts

if Rb status dictates the sensitivity of GBM cells to PD0332991, U87MG cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing five unique shRNAs to RB1, and stably expressing pooled
clones were generated by puromycin selection. Two of the
clones (19 and 63) showed >99% knockdown of Rb expression
relative to cells infected with the pLKO.1 vector alone (Fig. 2A).
BrdUrd incorporation and flow cytometry analysis at 48 hours
posttreatment revealed that Rb knockdown had substantially
mitigated the cell cycle inhibitory effects of PD-0332991 in
clones 19 and 63, relative to the empty vector pLKO.1 clone
(Fig. 2B). Long-term culture of clones 19 and 63 with 1 μmol/L
of PD-0332991 showed their failure to arrest in the presence
of drug, resulting in eventual growth to confluence (Fig. 2C),
albeit at a slower rate than cells treated with vehicle alone.
PD-0332991 suppresses the growth of GBM intracranial
xenografts. Next, we tested whether orally administered PD0332991 could efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier and
effectively suppress the growth of intracranial GBM tumors
comprised of cells with known sensitivity in vitro. To do this,
we established luciferase-modified U87MG xenografts in the
brains of a series of athymic mice, with half receiving daily
PD-0332991 by oral gavage, and the other half receiving vehicle only. Bioluminescence monitoring showed sustained antiproliferative activity of PD-0332991 throughout the 4-week
course of treatment (Fig. 3A, left), with tumor growth only
evident upon completion of therapy. Consistent with these
results, the survival of PD-0332991–treated mice was significantly extended relative to mice receiving vehicle only
(Fig. 3A, right; Supplementary Table S2). Importantly, none
of the mice receiving PD-0332991 succumbed to tumor-related
death while on therapy. In contrast, intracranial xenografts
derived from the Rb-deficient cell line SF767 were completely
resistant to PD-0332991 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To provide formal proof that PD-0332991 crosses the
blood-brain barrier, we dissected the brain of a mouse and
measured the levels of PD-0332991 in the U87MG xenograft
tumor, in surrounding normal brain, and in brain from contralateral hemisphere. Notably, LC-MS/MS analysis revealed
the presence of PD-0332991 in all three intracranial tissues.
Furthermore, the drug was present at a 25× to 35× higher concentration in tumor tissue than in normal tissue (Fig. 3B).
Next, the brains from treated and untreated mice with intracranial U87MG tumors (matched with respect to their time of
sacrifice) were formalin-fixed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for MIB-1 immunohistochemistry. Treatment with PD0332991 led to an >8-fold reduction in MIB-1 index (Fig. 3C).
It is widely appreciated that established GBM cell lines do
not recapitulate several aspects of GBM biology (e.g., in vivo invasiveness, the presence of genomic amplifications, gene expression profiles; refs. 19, 22–24). Therefore, we next tested the
efficacy of PD-0332991 against a model system that has been
shown to preserve patient tumor characteristics that are lost
and/or suppressed with extended in vitro propagation—primary
intracranial xenografts generated from surgically resected human tissue that have been directly implanted and serially passaged in nude mice (19). To do this, mice harboring primary
intracranial xenografts of luciferase-modified GBM 39 (which
harbors a homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A/B locus and is

Rb-proficient; ref. 25) were randomized to control and treatment groups at 25 days postinjection of tumor cells. Daily
treatment with PD-0332991 resulted in sustained growth suppression (Fig. 3D, left), with significant survival benefit to treatment group mice (Fig. 3D, right; Supplementary Table S2).
PD-0332991 combined with radiation therapy enhances the survival of mice with GBM intracranial xenografts. Radiation has long been used as a standard of care for
treating newly diagnosed GBM following surgical debulking
of tumor (26), and investigational drugs for treating newly
diagnosed GBM are likely to see use with radiotherapy. To
assess combined effects of radiation and PD-0332991 therapy, we established U87MG intracranial tumors in the brains
of athymic mice and randomized them to four treatment
groups at day 13 postinjection of tumor cells: control (mock
treated), radiotherapy only (2 Gy/d, days 13–17), PD-0332991
only (150 mg/kg/d, days 13–26), or combination therapy with
radiation administered either concurrently or sequentially,
with PD-0332991 and radiation combination regimens dosed
identically to their corresponding monotherapy regimens.
Both bioluminescence and survival analysis showed that
antitumor activity was most pronounced for mice receiving
combination therapy, either concurrent or sequential (Fig. 4A
and B; Supplementary Table S2).
PD-0332991 effectively suppresses the growth of recurrent GBM. An additional clinical scenario that often provides
a setting for initial testing of an investigational agent is the
treatment of recurrent cancer. For modeling this situation,
mice with intracranial U87MG tumors were treated with
10 mg/kg/d of temozolomide for 5 consecutive days, and
subsequently monitored for initial antitumor activity of therapy, as well as for tumor regrowth from therapy (Fig. 5A). At
the time of tumor regrowth, mice were randomized to four
treatment groups: (a) no additional treatment, (b) repeat
treatment with the same temozolomide regimen, (c) treatment with PD-0332991 at 150 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks, or (d)
combined treatment with temozolomide and PD-0332991 administered concurrently at identical doses as the monotherapies. Both bioluminescence monitoring (Fig. 5B) and survival
analysis (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Table S2) indicated that
each therapy resulted in improved survival compared with
no additional treatment. Furthermore, there was a trend favoring combination therapy with temozolomide and PD0332991 as the most efficacious.

Discussion
Frequent and perhaps obligatory genetic alteration affecting the cdk4/6-cyclin D-INK4-Rb growth-regulatory axis in
GBM is well documented (refs. 2–8; Table 1 in the current
report), and has been recently corroborated in two largescale, multi-institutional genomic analyses of GBM (9, 10).
The most common alteration of this pathway in GBM is homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B, encoding p16 INK4a and
p15INK4b, which is present in >50% of tumors. Other alterations include amplification and overexpression of CDK4
(15–20%) and homozygous deletion/mutation of RB1
(∼10%). Amplification of CDK6 and individual D-type cyclins,

PD-0332991 Arrests the Growth of GBM Intracranial Xenografts

Figure 4. PD-0332991 combined with radiation
therapy shows enhanced antitumor activity and

cells were injected into the brains of nude mice
to establish intracranial tumors. Mice were
randomized to four treatment groups: untreated
(Control), radiation only (RT, 2 Gy/d for 5 d,
horizontal gray lines), PD-0332991 only
(150 mg/kg/d for 14 d, horizontal black lines),
PD-0332991 and concurrent radiation (RTc),
and PD-0332991 with subsequent radiation
(RTs). A, bioluminescence monitoring was
conducted once or twice weekly throughout the
course of the experiment, with mean normalized
values plotted for each treatment group.

and homozygous deletion of CDKN2C encoding p18INK4c are
less common. Of these alterations, only genetic inactivation
of RB1 itself is thought to render a tumor resistant to inhibition of cdk4/6. Because genetic inactivation of RB1 occurs
infrequently in GBM, a substantial majority of patients with
GBM are predicted to be candidates for therapies targeting
cdk4/6.
Several previous studies have tested the effects of kinase
inhibitors against GBM (e.g., imatinib, erlotinib, and flavopir-

idol), both in a preclinical setting and in clinical trials without significant efficacy (27–29). Although some of these
compounds promiscuously inhibit cdks (e.g., flavopiridol),
none of the previously tested compounds display selectivity
for cdks relative to other kinases that may or may not be
activated in GBM. Our study for the first time tests a cdkspecific inhibitor in the treatment of GBM, demonstrating
significant efficacy both in vitro and in vivo as a single agent
and in combination with radiation therapy.

Figure 3. PD-0332991 crosses the blood-brain barrier and potently suppresses the growth of intracranial human GBM xenografts. U87MG cells (A–C) and
primary xenograft GBM 39 (D) were modified to express luciferase and injected into the brains of nude mice to establish intracranial tumors. Mice were
randomized to control (vehicle treated) and PD-0332991 treatment groups, with PD-0332991 administered daily by oral gavage at 150 mg/kg (4 wk for
U87MG; 12 wk for GBM 39: see gray horizontal line and arrow in A and D, respectively). Mice were imaged once or twice weekly for bioluminescence
intensity (see examples in A and D), with luminescence values of individual mice normalized to their corresponding luminescence at the start of therapy,
and mean normalized values plotted (left, A and D). B, one mouse from the U87MG treatment group was euthanized and its brain was dissected for
the isolation of pure tumor, brain adjacent to tumor (BAT), and normal tissue from the opposite hemisphere (OH). These specimens were analyzed by
LC-MS/MS for determination of PD-0332991 content, which showed the dissemination of PD-0332991 into the brain and accumulation in tumor tissue.
C, one mouse from the U87MG treatment group and one mouse from the control group were euthanized on the same day post-tumor cell injection,
and their brains dissected, fixed, and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry with MIB-1 antibody revealed >8-fold reduction in MIB-1 index in the
tumor from the PD-0332991–treated mouse relative to the control. A and D (right), Kaplan-Meier survival plots for the U87MG and GBM 39 experiments

PD-0332991 is an orally available pyridopyrimidine derivative that selectively inhibits cdk4/6 (12), leading to a reduction in Rb phosphorylation and subsequent cell cycle arrest.
The in vitro and in vivo results presented here further emphasize that Rb is the primary determinant of sensitivity to
cdk4/6 inhibition. This aspect of PD-0332991 efficacy should

be especially attractive with respect to clinical trial evaluation because there are excellent reagents and protocols
established for immunohistochemical detection of Rb in
paraffin-embedded tissues (14, 30).
Although Rb expression is clearly the primary determinant of
tumor cell response to PD-0332991, variable growth inhibition

PD-0332991 Arrests the Growth of GBM Intracranial Xenografts

among Rb-proficient cell lines (Table 1) suggests the existence of secondary factors that influence tumor cell sensitivity
to PD-0332991, such as tumor CDK4/6 amplification versus
CDKN2A homozygous deletion. For the cell lines examined
here, the single case with CDK6 amplification (CCF-STTG1)
showed substantial sensitivity to PD-0332991 (Table 1).
Analysis of GBM response to PD-0332991 in vivo, using
three different GBM tumor cell sources for establishing intracranial tumors (Fig. 3), yielded results entirely consistent
with the in vitro data. PD-0332991 arrested the growth of xenografts generated from U87MG cells and GBM 39 (both Rbproficient) and led to significantly improved survival (Fig. 3).
The growth-inhibitory effect of PD-0332991 was remarkably
durable during the period of treatment.
Recent studies point to interest in investigating antitumor
effects of PD-0332991 in combination with therapeutics that affect tumor properties other than cell cycling. For instance, it
has been shown that PD-0332991, which by itself does not promote apoptotic response of cancer cells, markedly enhances
myeloma cell killing by dexamethasone (15) as well as by bortezomib (31). Similarly, PD-0332991 has been shown to enhance
breast cancer cell sensitivity to tamoxifen in vitro (32). Here, our
bioluminescence and survival analysis of mice with intracranial
U87MG tumors indicate that the antitumor activity of PD0332991, when used with radiation either concurrently or sequentially, is superior to using either agent as a monotherapy
(Fig. 4). These results, therefore, could help motivate clinical trial testing of PD-0332991 against newly diagnosed GBM, for
which the use of radiotherapy is the standard of care.
Finally, treatment of intracranial GBM tumors that had
regrown following initial therapy with temozolomide showed
that PD-0332991 has activity against recurrent GBM (Fig. 5).
These results additionally suggest a general approach for

preclinical animal model testing of therapies for patients
with recurrent brain tumors, which is a mostly neglected
area of neuro-oncology research.
In total, these findings provide strong support for evaluating
the efficacy of PD-0332991 in treating patients with GBM. For
future investigation, it will be interesting to examine combination therapies involving PD-0332991 with small molecule
inhibitors targeting activated gene products in other GBM
core pathways, such as erlotinib for inhibiting the epidermal
growth factor receptor. Determination of the full range of
applications of this cdk4/6 inhibitor will undoubtedly prove
informative, and will hopefully lead to improved treatment
for this devastating cancer.
