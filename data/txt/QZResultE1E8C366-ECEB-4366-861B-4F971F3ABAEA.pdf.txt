ABSTRACT
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare cancer cells released from tumors
into the blood stream that are thought to have a key role in cancer metastasis.
Investigation of CTCs is an exciting area of research but remains in its infancy,
and the presence of CTCs has been associated with worse prognosis in several
major cancer types. Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly lethal malignancy and
a serious public health concern in East Asia especially in China. There is
an urgent need for identifying new, better prognostic markers to enhance
diagnosis and prognosis, facilitate drug development, and to improve the
treatment of gastric cancer patients. There are considerable interests in
gastric CTCs given their potential use as gastric cancer biomarkers. This
review highlights recent advances in studies of gastric CTCs, including the
isolation and biological molecular characteristics of gastric CTCs, and their
clinical significance.

INTRODUCTION

(CTCs). CTCs were first identified by Thomas Ashworth in
1869 [5]. However, the CTC research has been hampered
by the technical difficulties to detect these rare cells. It was
not until decades later that numerous new approaches were
established to isolate, enumerate, and characterize CTCs
in patients with various cancers [6]. CTCs have attracted
more and more attention not only because of their easy
accessibility but also their superiority over common tumor
markers. CTCs represent both the phenotypic and genetic
compositions of primary and metastatic tumors. Recent
studies have shown that CTCs can be found in many
solid tumor types such as lung, breast, renal, bladder,
head and neck, and colorectal cancers [7-16]. In some
of the solid cancers, enumeration of CTCs has served
as surrogate markers for overall survival (OS), risk of
relapse, progression-free survival (PFS) and chemotherapy
effectiveness [7-17]. The most recent efforts have focused
on haematological spread, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), cellular cooperation, circulating tumour
microemboli (CTM) and the tumor-initiating capability of
CTCs [18-25].
The aims of this review are to provide a
comprehensive overview on the studies of CTCs in GC,
including the biology, detection methods, and the clinical

Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly lethal malignancy
and a serious public health concern in East Asia, Eastern
Europe, Central and South America. It was the fourth most
common cancer (950000 new cases per year) and the third
leading cause of cancer death all around the world in 2012
(GLOBOCAN 2012) [1]. Despite recent improvement in
diagnosis and therapeutic methods, the 5-year survival
rate is still less than 30% [2]. Approximately 50% of
GC patients suffer from tumor recurrence or metastasis
after curative resection [3]. For the patients diagnosed
with advanced gastric cancer (AGC), chemotherapy and
target therapy are mainstays of treatment. Unfortunately,
more than 40% patients with AGC have no response to
chemotherapy and the others would acquire chemoresistance soon, which leads to both poor survival and
limited therapeutic options [4]. Therefore, there is an
urgent need for identifying new, better prognostic markers
to facilitate the diagnosis, improve the prediction of
relapse and metastasis, and to predict the prognosis and
determine the therapeutic responsiveness in AGC patients.

has been approved by U.S.FDA for CTC enumeration
to improve prognosis and treatment efficacy in breast,
colorectal and prostate cancer [47-49]. The platform is a
semi-automated methodology able to detect and enumerate
CTCs. 7.5 ml of whole blood is mixed with magnetic iron
nanoparticles coated with anti-EpCAM antibody. Then
EpCAM positive cells are stained with anti-CK and antiCD45 fluorescent antibodies to detect epithelial cells
and to exclude leukocytes, respectively. DAPI nuclear
dye (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) is used to allow
microscopic identification of relevant cell fraction. CTCs
are identified as CK+DAPI+CD45-. By using this method,
a number of studies have reported the role of CTCs in GC
patients.
Alternative approaches are in development to
improve detection rate by isolating CTCs with high purity.
One such approach is called CTC-chip consisting of an
array of antibody (EpCAM)-coated microposts and has
successfully identified CTCs in the peripheral blood of
patients with metastatic lung, prostate, pancreatic, breast
and colon cancer samples [50]. Another approach is called
“Herringbone-chip” created by the same research team
using herringbone grooves within the transparent wall of
the device allowing for higher blood volume throughput
and increases CTC capture efficiency and purity [51].

DETECTION OF CTCS IN PATIENTS
WITH GC
CTCs have been detected in the blood of cancer
patients at a very low concentration of 1 cell per 5×109
red cells and 5-10×106 white blood cells [26]. Therefore,
extremely sensitive and specific methods are required
for detecting and enumerating CTCs generated by
various malignancies including GC [17]. Generally,
CTCs detection is a two-step procedure: first enrichment
and then detection [27]. The enrichment step includes
morphologic-based isolation and immune-magnetic
selection (e.g. magnetic affinity cell sorting or magnetic
beads enrichment) [28]. The enrichment step captures
CTCs without labelling, using properties such as density
(gradient centrifugation), cell size (membrane filters),
electric charge (dielectrophoresis) and deform ability
(microfluidic system in a chip) [29-32]. The detection step
includes using either nucleic acid-based assays (reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) or cell
recognition-based assays.
In the early days, only RT-PCR was used to identify
and detect CTCs [33-34]. Identification of appropriate
markers expressed by CTCs is critical to enhance the
specificity and reliability of its detection. Conventional
markers such as CKs and CEA mRNA were most used
to detect CTCs in GC patients [35-37]. However, these
tumor markers are expressed in normal peripheral blood
cells and epithelial cells. Thus, some new biomarkers
expressed in CTCs such as survivin and B7-H3 have been
found to better predict tumor progression or prognosis in
gastric cancer patients [38-40]. Multiple markers have
been used to avoid false positive detection and increase
detection rate. The detection of c-Met or MUC1 mRNA
may be a promising tool for early detection of micrometastatic CTCs in GC patients [41]. The combination
of four markers (human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(TERT), cytokeratin 19 (CK19), CEA and MUC1) serves
as a prognostic indicator for postoperative recurrence/
metastasis and overall survival in GC [42]. In general
speaking, RT-PCR is highly sensitive, reproducible and
economically feasible. But the specificity of this method
is hindered by incalculability of CTCs and high false
positive rates due to illegitimate marker expression by
normal cells [43-44].
Cell-recognition based assays represent a major
advancement in detecting CTCs. After the enrichment step,
CTCs are detected using immunocytometric assays, such
as immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence and flow
cytometry [45]. Comparing to RT-PCR, cell-recognition
based assays allow enumeration of CTCs, morphological
analysis of stained cells and molecular characterization
of extracted cells [46]. Recently, the CellSearch system

BIOLOGY OF CTCS IN PATIENTS WITH
GC
Recently emerging evidences suggest that there
is considerable heterogeneity in CTC populations. This
feature of CTCs has potential of informing intra-tumor
heterogeneity and tumor evolution and thus has attracted
more and more attention of research community [27, 52].

Circulating gastric cancer stem cells
A subset of cancer cells are thought to have
the properties of adult stem cells (self-renewal and
multipotency) and are capable of initiating tumor
growth. These cells have been named as ‘cancer stem
cells’ or ‘tumor-initiating cells’. CTCs with stem celllike characteristics might play a crucial role in breast
cancer metastasis [53-54]. CD44 has been identified as a
marker of gastric cancer stem cells [55]. In a prospective
study of 45 GC patients, nineteen CTC-positive patients
had CD44-positive CTCs, and they were more likely
to develop metastasis and recurrence than patients with
CD44-negative CTCs. Moreover, the mean time to
recurrence was shorter in patients with CD44-positive
CTCs. Thus, CD44 positivity in CTCs might serve as a
novel marker for predicting metastasis and recurrence risk
for GC patients [56-57]. Consistent with this notion, our
group has found that compared to CD44-/CD45- gastric
CTCs, CD44+/CD45- gastric CTCs have stronger colony

cancer deserves more attention in the future.

GC CTCs and EMT

Molecular characterization of GC CTCs and
target therapy

Most cancer-related deaths are associated with
metastasis. CTCs are known to be necessary but not
sufficient for the initiation of metastasis. EMT is a
multistep process that plays a key role in metastasis and
cancer progression [59]. EMT is characterized by the
downregulation of epithelial markers, such as EpCAM
and CK, and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers,
such as vimentin and twist. CTCs that have undergone
EMT can escape the detection by the EpCAM-based
enrichment technique like CellSearch system [60].
Although several studies explored mesenchymal markers
(vimentin, N-cadherin, O-cadherin, twist, fibronectin and
serpin peptidase inhibitor) to profile the EMT phenotype
of CTCs, no defined marker or panel of markers have been
identified [61].
Li et al [62] detected CTCs of 44 GC patients for the
expression of four epithelial (E+) transcripts (keratins 8,
18, and 19 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule) and two
mesenchymal (M+) transcripts (Vimentin and Twist) by a
quantifiable, dual-colorimetric RNA-in situ hybridization
assay. CTCs had been captured in 35 GC patients and
EMT CTCs were identified in 14 patients with M+ or
M+ > E+. Our group also found that epithelial markers
pan-CK, E-cadherin were decreased, and mesenchymal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Ideally, CTCs are used as a liquid biopsy to
identify the molecular features of a patient’s tumor. Then
accordingly, the results may guide personalized treatment
options. Some small sample studies have been carried
out to verify this hypothesis [64-66]. For example, HER2
expression in CTCs of breast cancer has been evaluated.
Interestingly, some breast cancer patients have discordant
HER2 status for their CTCs (positive) and primary tumor
(negative), but they still benefit from trastuzumab therapy
[67-68].
Karyotyping and phenotyping of the enriched
CTCs in therapeutic advanced GC patients were carried
out by using the integrated subtraction enrichment (SET)
and immunofluorescence staining in situ hybridization
(iFISH) platform. CellSearch system was applied as a
reference control. Phenotyping of CTCs in HER2 positive
AGC patients demonstrated that HER2+ CTCs could
be effectively eliminated in response to HER2-targeted
therapy. Karyotyping of CTCs indicated that examination
of the copy number of chromosome 8 in CTCs provides
a potential approach for predicting chemotherapeutic
efficacy and monitoring chemo-resistance [69]. However,
the relevance of CTC heterogeneity in response to or

studies assessing the predictive value of CTCs are needed.

tumor progression and prognosis in patients with GC.
Besides being as diagnostic and prognostic
indicators, CTCs hold promise to be biomarkers to aid
in treatment selection. The detection of CTCs in the
peripheral blood of patients with AGC has been reported
to predict efficacy of chemotherapy treatment. In another
study, CTCs of whole blood at baseline, 2 weeks, and
4 weeks were detected in 52 patients with AGC treated
with S-1-based regimen (S-1 with or without cisplatin) or
paclitaxel. Patients with ≥4 CTCs at 2-week and 4-week
points had much shorter PFS and OS than those with <
4 CTCs [75.] A single-centre, prospective study was
undertaken in 136 AGC patients and their CTCs were
enumerated at baseline and at the first response evaluation.
Following 6 weeks of chemotherapy, the elevated CTCs
may correspond with an ineffective therapeutic response
and independently predict a shorter PFS and OS [76].
Monitoring dynamic changes of CTCs in response to
therapy may be a useful alternative for assessing treatment
resistance.
Measurement of CTCs may be a useful diagnostic
tool to predict pleural dissemination which is difficult
to detect in current imaging studies, such as computed
tomography, ultrasonography and positron emission
tomography. Breast cancer, prostate cancer or colorectal
cancer patients who have hematogenous metastasis
seem to have a high incidence of CTCs. However, by
the CellSearch system, CTCs were detected more often
in GC patients with peritoneal metastasis(PM)compared
to GC patients with hematogenous metastasis [74]. The
underlying mechanism remains unclear. Considering that
detection of CTCs by the CellSearch system is based on
isolation and enumeration of cells expressing EpCAM,
EpCAM appears to play an important role in peritoneal
metastasis (PM). Imano et al [77] have found that all of 35
PM specimens showed overexpression of EpCAM. Thus
they postulate that only GC cells expressing a high level of
EpCAM might metastasize to the peritoneum. Meanwhile,
the EpCAM antibody has been reported to be a therapeutic
agent in patients with malignant ascites in several types of
carcinoma [78].

CLINICALUTILITYOFCTCS IN PATIENTS
WITH GC
The detection of CTCs in peripheral blood has
received growing enthusiasm in the clinical utility of
various cancers. Since 1990s many studies have been
performed to indicate the correlation between CTCs and
the clinicopathological characteristics of gastric tumor
[33-42, 69-71]. These studies suggest that CTCs may
play a role in predicting tumor prognosis and response
to treatment. However, these studies used a variety
of methods for CTC detection. Tang et al [72] have
performed a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of
various CTCs detection methods in gastric cancer and
found that results vary among different detection methods.
They believe that a solid conclusion could be drawn with
the development of new detection technologies.
To date, the CellSearch system is the only CTCs
detecting technique approved by the U.S.FDA. It is
possible to obtain highly reproducible quantitative
results from different laboratories by using this detection
platform. CTC numbers as quantified by the CellSearch
procedure have been shown to have prognostic
significance, predicting chemotherapy effectiveness in
patients with various types of carcinomas (e.g. breast
cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer) [7-11]. The
current review will focus on studies reporting significant
data about the role of CTCs in gastric cancer obtained by
the CellSearch system (Table 1).
Measurement of CTCs in GC patients could be
useful for judging tumor stage and predicting patients’
survival. Yoshikazu et al [73] performed a prospective
study to evaluate CTCs in 251 GC patients and explored
the clinical impact of CTCs using the CellSearch system.
CTCs were detected in 16 patients (10.8%) from the
resection group with a significantly higher relapse rate,
in 62 patients (60.2%) from the nonresectable group but
not detected in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, CTCs in
patients who underwent gastrectomy were significantly
correlated with the depth of tumor invasion, lymph
node metastasis, distant metastasis, disease stage, vessel
invasion, and lymphatic invasion. Consistent with the
above, the overall survival rate of the entire cohort with
CTCs was significantly lower than that of patients without
CTCs. Hiraiwa et al [69] performed a similar study
enrolled with 130 gastrointestinal cancer patients and 41
healthy volunteers, including 44 gastric cancer patients.
CTC counts were larger in 27 metastatic GC patients than
that in 14 non-metastatic patients. Another study including
136 patients with AGC suggests that emergence of CTCs
is an independent predictor of a shorter PFS [74]. Thus,
evaluation of CTCs may be a useful strategy for predicting

PERSPECTIVES
In summary, the science of CTCs is an exciting area
of research but remains in its infancy. The translation of
CTC research to a routine clinical test is hurdled by the
lack of consensus in technical approaches. The CellSearch
system is the first standard semi-automated methodology
approved by U.S.FDA to detect and enumerate CTCs. A
number of studies have reported that enumeration of CTCs
using the CellSearch system could serve as an indicator
of prognosis and treatment efficacy in various cancers,
such as breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Recently,
several studies reported that measurement of CTCs with
the CellSearch in GC patients could be utilized for judging
25716

tumor stage, predicting patients’ survival and evaluating
therapeutic response. However, large-scale clinical trials
would be desirable for further validating the significant
role of CTCs in GC patients and for determining the
proper cutoff of positive CTCs score for GC patients.
CTCs are now defined to be a group of
heterogeneous cells and have been suggested to have
great potential for personalized therapy selection. This
will be the key direction in CTCs research field. More
studies are still needed to understand the CTC biology and
determine the biomarkers of different subgroup of CTCs
(e.g. EMT transition cells, stem cells). The CellSearch
technology has limitation in detecting EMT CTCs. Novel
revolutionary approaches must have increased sensitivity
to accommodate CTC heterogeneity and need to be
assessed in clinical trials to gain a position in clinical
practice.
