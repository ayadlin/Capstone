ABSTRACT
Hyper-activation of PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) is frequently observed in
human cancer and speculated as a target of novel anti-tumor drug. In previous,
we also showed that PAK1 is highly activated in the Smad4-deficient condition and
suppresses PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) through direct binding
and phosphorylation. On the basis of this result, we have tried to find novel PAK1PUMA binding inhibitors. Through ELISA-based blind chemical library screening, we
isolated single compound, IPP-14 (IPP; Inhibitor of PAK1-PUMA), which selectively
blocks the PAK1-PUMA binding and also suppresses cell proliferation via PUMAdependent manner. Indeed, in PUMA-deficient cells, this chemical did not show antiproliferating effect. This chemical possessed very strong PAK1 inhibition activity that it
suppressed BAD (Bcl-2-asoociated death promoter) phosphorylation and meta-phase
arrest via Aurora kinase inactivation in lower concentration than that of previous
PAK1 kinase, FRAX486 and AG879. Moreover, our chemical obviously induced p21/
WAF1/CIP1 (Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A) expression by releasing from Bcl-2
(B-cell lymphoma-2) and by inhibition of AKT-mediated p21 suppression. Considering
our result, IPP-14 and its derivatives would be possible candidates for PAK1 and p21
induction targeted anti-cancer drug.

than 20% of colon cancers show deletion of Smad4 [12–
14], inhibition of PAK1 would be one of plausible strategy
for treatment of human cancers such as pancreatic cancer
and colon cancer.
In NF2 syndrome (neurofibromatosis type 2
syndrome), elevated PAK1 activity has been reported,
because NF2 is inhibitor of PAK1 [15, 16]. According
to recent report, NF2 suppresses PAK1 activity through
direct interaction of regulatory domain [15]. Thus,
selective PAK1 inhibitor has been proposed to be potent
candidate target for NF2 syndrome as well as NF2
deficient human cancers such as mesothelioma [17].
In addition, PAK1 and AKT can activate each other
through direct interaction [18]. Since AKT signaling is
essential for cancer growth, PAK1 inhibition would also
suppress the AKT activity.
Considering various role of PAK1 in cancer
progression and initiation, PAK1 is very attractive

INTRODUCTION
Elevated expression of PAK1 (p21-activated kinase
1) is frequently observed in various kinds of human
cancers including colon or pancreatic cancers [1, 2].
This kinase has been reported to be involved in broad
oncogenic properties including anti-apoptosis, cell cycle
promotion and metastasis. Indeed, PAK1, activated by
small GTP-proteins (such as cdc42 or Rac), can promote
cell migration [3, 4], and can suppress the apoptosis
through BAD phosphorylation [5–7]. In addition, PAK1mediated Aurora A phosphorylation has been suggested as
mitosis promoting mechanism [8–10].
In previous results, we revealed that activation of
PAK1 in Smad4 deficient cancers suppresses PUMAmediated apoptosis [11]. Actually, Smad4-deficient cancer
cells are resistant to serum-deprivation-induced cell death
[11]. Considering that half of pancreatic cancers and more

migration

target protein for development of anti-cancer drug. In
this study, we have tried to find novel PAK1 inhibitory
chemicals. On the basis of PAK1-PUMA binding, we
have revealed that single novel compound can suppress
PAK1 activity and induce cell death only in PAK1
activated and Bcl-2 overexpressed cancer cells. In
addition, this chemical induces p21 and G2/M arrest.
Thus, this chemical would be one of strong candidate
for anti-cancer drug against various human malignancies
including pancreatic cancers, colon cancer as well as
NF2 deficient cancers.

To avoid the random cytotoxicity and false positive
reaction of chemicals, we checked the cytotoxic effect
of a group of chemicals including IPP-14 on PAK1
overexpressed pancreatic cancer cell line, MIA-Paca2
(Supplementary Figure 2A), comparing to human gastric
cancer cell line, MKN45 (Supplementary Figure 2B). This
analysis suggested that IPP-14 can obviously suppress cell
viability in PAK1 overexpressed cells. IPP-14 showed
more dramatic dosage effect on MIA-Paca2 viability than
other chemicals (IPP-19, -23, and -27; Supplementary
Figure 2C). Next, we checked the effect of IPP-14 on
Smad4-deficient Capan-1 (human pancreatic cancer cells).
As we expected, IPP-14 suppressed cell viability in the
Smad4-deficient cells (Figure 1E). However, we did not
observe the reduction of PAK1 expression or additional
induction of PUMA expression by IPP-14 under the
serum-free condition (Figure 1F). Instead, p21 induction
was also detected in IPP-14-treated cells in regardless
of Smad4 status (Figure 1F). Since PAK1 is involved in
cell migration [3, 4], we next monitored the effect of IPP14 on cell migration using transwell assay. Under low
cytotoxic condition (1 μM, 16 hr), we could observe the
inhibitory effect of IPP-14 on cell migration in HCT116
and Capan-1 (Figure 1G). Indeed, 1 μM of IPP-14 did not
induce cytotoxicity at tested time points (From 12 hr to 18
hr; Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B).

RESULTS
Identification of PAK1-PUMA binding inhibitor
In previous result, we revealed that serumstarvation-induced cell death can be activated by
PUMA via Smad4-induced PAK1 inhibition. In fact,
PAK1 blocks PUMA through direct binding and
phosphorylation [11]. Thus, specific binding inhibitor
of PAK1-PUMA would induce cell death in Smad4deficient or PAK1 activated cancers. To prove this, we
designed the ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay) based drug screening system using recombinant
proteins [19] and performed the blind screening using
3 kinds of chemical libraries (Korean chemical bank,
natural compound library, and personal chemical
libraries; Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B). Among
tested about 12000 chemicals, three chemicals (IPP-14,
22, and 23, IPP; Inhibitor of PAK1-PUMA) could block
the interaction of PAK1 and PUMA (Supplementary
Figure 1C). Thus, we checked the effect of these
chemicals on cell viability of HCT116 and its isogenic
HCT PUMA-/- cell lines [20]. Interestingly, IPP-14
(Supplementary Figure 1D), but not other chemicals
(IPP-22 and 23), suppressed the cell viability in HCT116
(human colorectal cancer cells) (Figure 1A). However,
HCT116 PUMA-/- showed the resistance to IPP-14induced cell death (Figure 1A), indicating that IPP-14induced cell death is achieved by PUMA-dependent
manner. We also confirmed the inhibitory effect on
PAK1-PUMA binding through Glutathione S-transferase
(GST) pull-down and Immunoprecipitation (IP) assay
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1E). To know
how IPP-14 suppresses cell viability, we checked the
expression of several related proteins by western blot
analysis. Inconsistently with our expectation, IPP-14 did
not alter the expression of Smad4 and PUMA, although
PAK1 expression was reduced under serum-present
condition (Figure 1C and 1D). Instead, we observed
obvious induction of p21 in HEK293 and HCT116 cell
lines (Figure 1C and 1D), differentially from commercial
PAK1 kinase inhibitor, AG879 [21]. In addition, p53,
well-confirmed p21 upstream regulator [22, 23], was not
altered by IPP-14 (Figure 1D), suggesting that IPP-14
induced p21 is not related with p53.

IPP-14 induces p21 expression
Since induction of p21 is very obvious effect of
IPP-14, we investigated the mechanism of it. First of
all, we monitored the p21 induction in several kinds
of cell lines. All tested cancer cell lines showed the
induction of p21 in response to IPP-14 (Figure 2A and
Supplementary Figure 4A) with very rapid kinetics
(Supplementary Figure 4B) without transcriptional
induction (Supplementary Figure 4C). In addition, de
novo transcription inhibitor, Actinomycin D (Act. D)
did not block the p21 induction (Figure 2B), indicating
that IPP-14-induced p21 would be achieved by
transcription independent mechanism. Moreover, de novo
translation inhibitor, CHX, could completely eliminate
p21 expression (Figure 2B), suggesting that IPP-14
might increase pre-existed p21 level. However, IPP14 did not extend p21 half-life (Supplementary Figure
4D) and showed the additional effect with proteasome
inhibitors (ALLN and MG132; Supplementary Figure
4E). These results indicated that there would be unusual
regulation mechanism for p21 expression. To explore the
mechanism of IPP-14-related p21 induction mechanism,
we next checked the effect of IPP-14 on exogenous
p21. IPP-14 could induce exogenous wild type p21
expression as well as T145D and T145A mutants (Figure
2C). However, the effect of IPP-14 on p21 mutants was

less dramatic than that on wild type p21 (Figure 2C),
implying that AKT-mediated p21 phosphorylation would
be related with IPP-14 induced p21. Before testing the
engagement of AKT on IPP-14 effect, we checked
the involvement of PAK1 kinase activity. To test this,
we measured the expression of p21 in the FRAX486
(selective PAK1 kinase inhibitor) [24, 25] treated cells.
However, we did not observe the p21 induction (Figure
2D), despite long term treatment (Figure 2E). This result
indicated that PAK1 kinase activity was not related with
p21 induction by IPP-14. So, we returned to relevance
of AKT on IPP-14 induced p21. Since p21-T145 residue
is phosphorylated by AKT, resulted in rapid degradation
of p21 [26], we monitored the effect of IPP-14 on AKTPAK1 binding. Indeed, PAK1 N-terminal domain (not
kinase domain) is associated with AKT [18]. Our GST
pull down assay using PAK1-N-terminal domain showed
the inhibitory effect of IPP-14 on the interaction of PAK1
and AKT1 (Supplementary Figure 4F). In addition, IPP14 showed the similar effect on p21 expression with
LY294002, PI3K inhibitor (Supplementary Figure 4G).
Considering our result, IPP-14-induced p21 induction
would be partially achieved by AKT1 suppression via
PAK1-AKT binding inhibition. However, we did not
fully demonstrate p21 induction by AKT1-PAK1 binding
inhibition, because p21-T145D was also induced by IPP14 (Figure 2C).

2F). However, FRAX486 did not show the difference on
cell viability between HCT116 and its isogenic HCT116
p21-/- (Figure 2F). This result indicated that IPP-14 and
its derivatives could execute biological effect via different
mechanism from PAK1 kinase activity inhibition. In fact,
IPP-14 derivatives could induce p21 expression at posttranslational level (Figure 2G and Supplementary Figure
5D). To address how IPP-14 could reduce cell viability
in HCT116 p21-/- cells, we checked the cell cycle and
found that IPP-14 could obviously induce G2/M arrest
in regardless of p21 status (Figure 2H). Indeed, IPP-14
could suppress cyclin B1 expression in HCT116 p21/- cells (Figure 2I). Our results indicated that IPP-14mediated tumor suppressive effect was achieved by
PUMA-mediated cell death (Figure 1A), p21-mediated
cell cycle arrest (Figure 2F) and p21-independent G2/M
arrest (Figure 2H).

The biological effect of IPP-14 on PUMA
deficient cells
Since PUMA-mediated cell death seemed to be
one of important pathway of IPP-14-induced tumor
suppression, we next checked the effect of IPP-14 in
PUMA and BAX deficient cell lines [28]. Consistently
with our previous result, IPP-14 only showed the marginal
effect in PUMA deficient cells (Figure 3A). In addition, we
did not observe obvious effect in HCT116 BAX-/- as well
as normal human fibroblast (Figure 3A). In addition, we
did not observe the induction of p21 in normal fibroblast
and non-cancer HaCaT cells (human keratinocyte cells)
(Figure 3B), suggesting that IPP-14 would be non-toxic
on non-cancer cells. Next, we measured the expression of
p21 in PUMA and BAX deficient cell lines. In the both
cell lines, p21 induction was not obvious, comparing
to parental HCT116 (Figure 3C). To confirm the
independence of p53 on IPP-14-induced p21, we tested
several cell lines. In regardless of p53 status, IPP-14
could induce p21 expression in all of tested cell lines
(Supplementary Figure 6A), even in p53 deleted HCT116
(Supplementary Figure 6B). Since PAK1 kinase inhibitor,
FRAX486 did not induce p21 expression (Supplementary
Figure
6B),
IPP-14-mediated
p21
induction
would be achieved via PAK1 kinase activity-independent
mechanism. Indeed, elimination of PAK1 using siRNA
did not induce p21 expression and eliminate IPP-14mediated p21 induction (Supplementary Figure 6C). Thus,
we focused on why PUMA/BAX deficient cells were
resistant to IPP-14-induced p21 induction. IPP-14 and
proteasome inhibitor did not show additional induction
of p21 in PUMA and BAX deficient HCT116 cell lines
comparing to HCT116 cells. (Supplementary Figure 4E
and Supplementary Figure 6D). These results suggest that
induction of p21 by IPP-14 was related with Bcl-2 family
proteins. Since PUMA and BAX are pro-apoptotic protein
and loss of them may release free Bcl-2 protein, we

The similar effect of IPP-14 derivatives on cell
viability
To confirm the effect of IPP-14 and avoid the false
positive effect, we obtained the IPP-14 derivatives from
Korean chemical bank and checked the effect on cell
viability (Supplementary Figure 5A). Among tested 100
relative chemicals, 4 chemicals (IPP-115, 120, 151, and
159) could suppress cell viability as strongly as IPP14 (Supplementary Figure 5B) and showed the similar
chemical structure (Supplementary Figure 5C). Since
IPP-151 showed mild suppression effect on cell viability
(Supplementary Figure 5B), we therefore tested 3 kinds
of chemicals further study. In fact, three chemicals could
induce p21 expression, like as IPP-14 (Supplementary
Figure 5D). However, IPP-14 derivative did not alter
the p21 half-life, similarly with IPP-14. (Supplementary
Figure 5E; IPP-159). These results suggest that IPP-14 and
its relative chemicals can show similar tumor suppressive
function.

The tumor suppressive effect of IPP-14 and its
relatives is not fully dependent on p21
We next checked the cell viability in p21-deficient
HCT116 after treatment of IPP-14 and its derivatives to
know the dependency of p21. Indeed, HCT116 p21-/- [27]
partially responded to IPP-14 related chemicals (Figure

speculated that Bcl-2 would be inhibitor of p21. Actually,
p21 expression was reduced in PUMA or BAX-deficient
cells (Figure 3C). To confirm this, we measured the p21
expression in Bcl-2 transfected cells and found that Bcl2 suppressed p21 expression and also blocked the IPP14-induced p21 (Figure 3D). In addition, Bcl-2 reduced
all kinds of exogenous p21 mutants (Figure 3E). Indeed,
interaction between p21 and Bcl-2 was diminished by
IPP-14 (Figure 3F). However, in PUMA deficient cells,
the binding of p21 and Bcl-2 was not disrupted by IPP14 (Figure 3G), indicating that IPP-14-mediated p21
induction would be achieved by inhibition of Bcl-2, which
was facilitated by activated PUMA. In addition, expression
of Bcl-2 was very low in normal fibroblast and non-cancer
HaCaT cells, comparing to HCT116 (Figure 3H), provided
the clue why these cells were resistant to IPP-14 induced
p21. These results indicate releasing of p21 from Bcl-2
was one of important mechanism for inducing of p21 by
IPP-14. However, until now, we did not have clear answer
how Bcl-2 suppresses p21 expression, independently with
proteasome.

cells still responded to IPP-14 (Figure 2F). These
results indicated that there are additional mechanism
for suppression of cancer cell viability. To reveal
this, we checked the cell cycle in PUMA and BAX
deficient HCT116 through FACS and observed the
significant cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase (Figure
4A). Since the kinase activity of PAK1 facilitates
M-phase progression through activation of Aurora A
kinase [8], we assumed that IPP-14 also inhibits PAK1
kinase activity. Indeed, we found the blocking of BAD
phosphorylation and the partial suppression of AKT
phosphorylation by IPP-14 (0.5 μM), similarly with
FRAX486 (5 μM), at low concentration (Supplementary
Figure 6E). Furthermore, IPP-14 caused G2/M phase
arrest (4N DNA) and increase of >4N DNA containing
cell population (Figure 4A). Thus, we monitored the
effect of IPP-14 on Aurora kinase A. The distribution
of Aurora A following spindle fibers were abolished
by IPP-14 (Figure 4B), which indicates that IPP-14
inhibits Aurora A kinase activity through PAK1. In
addition, similarly with PAK1 inhibitor, FRAX486,
IPP-14 obviously suppressed the Aurora A expression
as well as phosphorylation of Aurora A in HCT116
(Figure 4C). However, in the H1299 cell (human lung
cancer cells), reduction of Aurora A and induction of
p21 were marginal (Figure 4D). Consistently, H1299
were resistant to IPP-14 (Supplementary Figure 6F).

IPP-14 induces M-phase arrest by inhibition of
PAK1
Although we found that induction of p21 by IPP14 was important for anti-tumor effect, p21 deficient

and cell death through PUMA activation. Furthermore, IPP-14 can bind to PUMA as well as PAK1 then activated PUMA promotes p21
releasing from Bcl-2. However, p21 upregulation by IPP-14 is independent of PAK1 suppression. Thus, IPP-14 could be involved in PAK1Aurora A mediated G2/M phase arrest, PUMA-mediated cell death, PAK1-independent p21 induction. So, It would be proper anti-cancer
drug against PAK1 activated or Bcl-2 overexpressed cancers.

Until now, we did not know the reason of resistance
but from this cell lines, we revealed that reduction
of Aurora A and induction of p21 were important for
biological effect of IPP-14. Comparing to FRAX486,
IPP-14 could more rapidly suppress Aurora A at lower
concentration (Figure 4C). Finally, we tested the effect
of IPP-14 on NF2-deficient cancer cell lines, because
NF2 suggested as PAK1 inhibitor [15, 16]. Compared
to FRAX486, IPP-14 induced reduction of viability in
two kinds of NF2-impaired cell lines, MDA-MB-231
(human breast cancer cells) and ACHN (human renal
cancer cells) (Figure 4E). Since PAK1 inhibitors has
been suggested as putative candidate for NF2 deficient
cancers including NF2 syndrome, IPP-14 would be one
of plausible chemicals for NF2 syndrome and other
cancers. In addition, we tested the cooperative effect
of IPP-14 with commercially used EGFR (Epidermal
growth factor receptor) inhibitors. However, we only
observed the IPP-14 effect (Supplementary Figure 6F).

Although PUMA or BAX deficient cell lines are
resistant to IPP-14-induced p21 induction, they are also
arrested at G2/M phase by IPP-14 (Figure 4A), indicating
that IPP-14-induced Aurora A inhibition was not related
with PUMA. It would be achieved by suppression of
PAK1 itself. Thus, IPP-14 could activate three signaling
pathways, PUMA-mediated cell death, PAK1-independent
p21 induction, and Aurora-mediated cell cycle arrest
(Figure 5). This property seems to be very proper for
using anti-cancer drug, since it can be used in apoptosis
signaling defect cancer as well as cell cycle regulation
defect cancers.
Moreover, IPP-14 worked very well at low
concentration. This result indicates that IPP-14 is
very specific inhibitor for PAK1 and Bcl-2. However,
we did not fully demonstrate how IPP-14 can activate
both signaling. Our hypothesis is that IPP-14 can bind
to PAK1 as well as PUMA. Since PUMA is essential
for p21 induction, we speculate that IPP-14 bound
PUMA might associate to Bcl-2 and release p21 from
Bcl-2-mediated p21 reduction. In other hands, IPP-14
associates with PAK1 N-terminal region and shut-down
PAK1 activity. To address this, more intensive study
should be performed.
Taken together, IPP-14, which has been isolated as
PUMA-PAK1 binding inhibitor, can induce p21 and inhibit
PAK1 activity. Thus, IPP-14 would be one of plausible
anti-cancer drug candidate against PAK1 activated or Bcl2 overexpressed cancers.

DISCUSSION
For a long time, inhibition of PAK1 has been
suggested as one of plausible strategy for anti-cancer
treatment [29, 30]. However, direct targeting of kinase
activity has generated undesired side effect, because of
similar structure of other kinase domain [29, 31]. In this
study, we tried to find a specific inhibitor of PAK1-PUMA
binding, because their binding occurs through N-terminal
regulatory domain of PAK1. In addition, N-terminal region
is important for association with AKT and NF2 [15]. Here,
we suggested IPP-14 as specific inhibitor of PUMA and
PAK1. Indeed, IPP-14 could suppress PAK1 kinase activity
(Figure 1G) and induce M phase arrest via blocking of
PAK1-mediated Aurora A activation (Figure 4A-4D).
However, differentially from previous kinase inhibitor
such as FRAX468, IPP-14 would be targeted to N-terminal
regulatory domain of PAK1. Actually, in our previous
result, PUMA is directly interacted with N-terminal PAK1
domain and we also used N-terminal region of PAK1 for
drug screening. Although we did not provide the direct
evidence for interaction of IPP-14 and PAK1 domain,
considering that IPP-14 can block the interaction of PAK1
and AKT1 as well as PAK1 and PUMA. Its binding target
would be N-terminal region of PAK1.
In addition, we observed the robust induction of p21
by IPP-14. Interesting it was independent with PAK1 and
fully dependent on PUMA (Figure 3A-3C). Indeed, PUMA
deficient cells were resistant to IPP-14-induced p21.
Although we did not provide the underlying mechanism
how Bcl-2 suppress p21, it is very clear that liberated p21
from Bcl-2 can induce cell cycle arrest and performed
the tumor suppressive role and that IPP-14 can promote
p21 releasing from Bcl-2. So, we are now investigating
the molecular mechanism about Bcl-2-mediated p21
suppression.

secondary antibodies. For the analysis of protein-protein
interaction, Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down
assay and Immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment were
performed. To detect the interaction between PUMA
and PAK1 or AKT and PAK1, GST pull-down assay was
conducted using agarose bead-conjugated GST-PAK1-N
terminal domain (residues 70-149). After incubating GSTrecombinant protein with transfected lysates (PUMA or
AKT) for 1 hr at 4 °C, the precipitated proteins were also
separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed via western blot
experiment. IP assay were performed by using a proper
antibody and with transfected lysates. Whole cell lysates
expressing p21-FLAG and Bcl-2-HA were incubated with
anti-HA antibody for 2 hr at 4 °C and then with protein
A/G agarose beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for
2 hr. After centrifugation and washing with RIPA buffer,
the immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and
subjected to western blot with anti-FLAG, Actin and HA.

For chemical screening, we generated ELISA assay
system [19]. To isolate PAK1-PUMA binding inhibitor,
we immobilized PAK1 recombinant protein on a 96-well
plate using 0.5% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After the plates
were dried and washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), we incubated with 25 μM, 50 μM of chemicals
(final concentration), followed by adding PUMA protein.
After 2 hr reaction, the 96-well plates were washed with
PBS and blocked by 3% skim milk to remove background.
The plates were incubated with anti-PUMA Ab (diluted in
1:10,000) for 1 hr and then anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (diluted
in 1:50,000) for 1 hr. After washing twice, plates were
incubated with a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
solution (Calbiochem) for 30 min and Stop solution (1N
H2SO4) for 30 min. Finally, we speculated the value by
using the ELISA reader (absorbance at 450 nm). Chemical
libraries were provided by GY Song (Chungnam National
University, Deajeon, Korea), HY Moon (Pusan National
University, Busan, Korea) and Korean Chemical Bank
(Korea). About 12,000 chemical compounds were used in
this screening.

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS and
fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature and
then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10
min. After cells were treated with blocking solution (antiHuman Antibody diluted 1:500 in PBS) for 1 hr, cells were
incubated with anti-Aurora A (diluted in 1:200), γ-tublin
(T6557; Sigma; diluted 1:500 in blocking solution) for
overnight at 4 °C. Finally, the cells were incubated with
FITC and Rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies at
4 °C for 6 hr. The nucleus was stained with 4, 6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min. Cells were washed
three times with PBS, then the coverslips were mounted
with mounting solution (H-5501; Vector Laboratories
(Burlingame, CA, USA)) and analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy (Zeiss Axioplan2, Oberkochen, Germany),
400x magnification.

Recombinant proteins
To produce the recombinant proteins, the human
PAK1 N-terminal domain fragment (residue 70-149) and
the full-length human PUMA (residue 1-193) were ligated
into the Eco RI and HindIII sites of the pGEX-TEV vector,
which is modified vector made by adding a TEV protease
cleavage site to pGEX-4T1 (Invitrogen). The recombinant
proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli (E.coli)
strain BL21 (DE3) as GST-fusion proteins. The proteins
were purified by glutathione-affinity chromatography.

were summarized by their mean±SD (standard deviation).
Before ANOVA for group comparison is performed, we
first applied Shapiro-Wilk test and Levene’s test to check
data normality and to assess the equality of variances,
respectively. When both normality and homoscedasticity
are met, one-way analysis of variance was conducted
to compare the difference of a response variable for
each condition, and a Tukey’s HSD test was performed
for post-hoc multiple comparison. When the data are
satisfied with neither normality nor homoscedasticity, a
non-parametric method Kruskal-Wallis test was used to
assess equality of multiple group means, and then MannWhitney U test was performed for post-hoc multiple
comparisons. For adjusting family-wise Type I error rate,
we applied Bonferroni correction to adjust the p-values
of multiple testing. SPSS 21.0 was used for all statistical
analysis.

RNA isolation and RT-PCR
For RT-PCR, total cellular RNA was extracted
using RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). After measurement
of RNA concentration, 1 μg of total RNA was
reverse transcribed to cDNA using MMLV RT
(Invitrogen) and random hexamers. RT-PCR was
performed with the following specific primers: p21,

In vitro migration assay
For the analysis of in vitro cell migration, Transwell
assay was performed using a pore size 8 μm Polycarbonate
Membrane Transwell Inserts (3422; Corning, NY, USA).
First, 0.6 ml media containing 10% FBS was added to
the well plate. Cells were re-suspended in serum-free
medium, and 0.1 ml of the cell suspension was added to
the inside compartment. The plate was incubated with or
without indicated chemical in 5% CO2 incubator for 16
hr. Then the cells in upper chamber were removed, and
the attached cells in the bottom section were fixed by 4%
PFA for 30 min. After fixation, migratory cells are stained
by 0.5% Trypan blue solution (Gibco, BRL, Paisley, UK)
and quantified. The migration rate was quantified by
counting the migration cells in six random fields using a
light microscope.
