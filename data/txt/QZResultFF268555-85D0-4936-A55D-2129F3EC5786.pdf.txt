ABSTRACT
The hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are standard therapy for patients with
higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); however, the majority of the patients
will lose their response to HMAs over time due to unknown mechanisms. It has recently
been shown that T cell expression of the immunoinhibitory receptor PD-1 is regulated
by DNA methylation. In 12 of 27 patients (44%) PD-1 promoter demethylation
was observed in sorted peripheral blood T cells isolated over consecutive cycles of
treatment with 5-azacytidine (5-aza). The PD-1 promoter demethylation correlated
with an increase in PD-1 expression. Moreover, demethylation of the PD-1 promoter
correlated with a significantly worse overall response rate (8% vs. 60%, p = 0.014),
and a trend towards a shorter overall survival (p = 0.11) was observed. A significantly
higher baseline methylation level of the PD-1 promoter was observed in T cells of
non-responding patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.023).
Accordingly, in addition to their beneficial function, HMAs induce PD-1 expression
on T cells in the MDS microenvironment, thereby likely hampering the immune
response against the MDS blasts. Thus, we suggest that activation of the PD-1
checkpoint during HMA treatment can be a possible resistance mechanism, which
may be overcome by combination therapy with a PD-1 pathway inhibitor.

in patients with higher-risk MDS [2]. 5-azacytidine
(5-aza) treatment has also prolonged overall survival (OS)
in patients with AML with 20–30% bone marrow blasts
[5], and decitabine (5-aza-2’deoxycytidine) has improved
the response rates in older patients (> 65 yrs) with
newly diagnosed AML [6]. In addition, HMAs are also
approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration and
the European Medicines Agency for treatment of chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Still, only about 50%
of the HMA treated patients achieve a clinical response, the
majority will lose response over time [2], and the outcome
after HMA failure is poor with a median survival of only

INTRODUCTION
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal
hematopoietic stem cell disorders, characterized by
increased proliferation and aberrant differentiation
combined with a high rate of apoptosis [1]. This results in
ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral blood cytopenias
as well as an increased risk of developing acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). Compared to conventional care
regimens, hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have resulted
in improved outcomes in MDS [2–4], including delayed
leukemic transformation [4] and prolonged survival

function, referred to as exhausted T cells. Interestingly, in
vitro studies showed that treatment with an HMA increases
the expression of PD-1 on activated T cells [18].
PD-L1 and, to a lesser extent, PD-L2 are overexpressed
in various types of human tumors, including hematological
malignancies such as MDS and AML [19–23]. An increasing
amount of data indicate that interactions between PD-1 and
its ligands are important mechanisms of immune suppression
in the tumor microenvironment [15, 19, 20].
The objective of this study was to investigate the in
vivo effect of HMA on PD-1 methylation and expression
in T cells obtained from patients during 5-aza treatment,
and to evaluate the rationale of combining HMA with a
PD-1 pathway inhibitor in MDS.

5.6 months [7]. Consequently, there is an urgent need for
efficient new treatment modalities in MDS.
The molecular mechanisms of action of HMAs
are currently not completely understood. Reactivation of
silenced tumor suppressor genes has been suggested to be
a key event [8]; however, others and we have also shown
that HMAs induce the expression of tumor antigens such
as cancer testis antigens (CTAs) on the malignant cells [9,
10]. Since CTAs are normally only expressed at immune
privileged sites, e.g. in testicular germ cells, expression
of CTAs by the MDS blasts can stimulate an anti-tumor
immune response by induction of effector T cells of
the adaptive immune system [11–13]. By contrast, the
mechanisms of resistance to HMAs are largely unknown.
The programmed death-1 (PD-1) is an immuno­
inhibitory receptor mainly expressed on activated T cells
[14]. Two ligands for PD-1 are currently known, PD-L1
(B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC). Under normal circumstances
both ligands are expressed in low levels in a wide variety
of cell types, but surface expression of the protein is rare
[15]. The major role of PD-1 is to limit T cell effector
responses in peripheral tissues in relation to infection
and inflammation, and to limit autoimmunity [14, 16]. In
addition, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays an important role
in tumor immune evasion and growth [17]. Interestingly, it
was recently shown that expression of PD-1 on T cells is
regulated by DNA methylation [18]. Hypomethylation of the
PD-1 promoter was observed in CD8+ T cells with inhibited

RESULTS
PD-1 methylation in healthy individuals
First, we evaluated the level of PD-1 promoter
methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMNCs), granulocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells,
CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells from five healthy
donors (Figure 1). The mean PD-1 methylation level was:
PBMNCs 37.2% (range 24.9–58.7), granulocytes 60.1%
(range 47.3–77.5), CD3+ T cells 20.2% (range, 9.7–33.2),
CD4+ T cells 24.9% (range 11.6–38.5), CD8+ T cells
24.0% (range 12.8–46.0) and CD19+ B cells 43.3% (range

31.5–67.3). The analyses revealed a varying methylation
level both among the different cell types and donors. The T
cell population carried the lowest level of PD-1 promoter
methylation, which is in line with the fact that the highest
PD-1 gene expression is observed in T cells.

We observed that the baseline level as well as the
continuous level of PD-1 promoter methylation varied
among the patients during 5-aza treatment with different
methylation patterns over time. In nine patients PD-1
promoter demethylation was observed, mostly followed
by a diverse remethylation just before the start of the next
cycle. In the remaining six patients a stable methylation
level, or a slight gain in methylation, was seen throughout
the entire treatment period (Figure 2B). The mean baseline
methylation level was significantly higher in the group
of patients in whom we observed a demethylation of the
PD-1 promoter, 57.0% (SD, 16.2) vs. 30.4% (SD, 15.0),
p = 0.007, 95%-CI [8.7;44.5]. Taken together, these results
reveal that 5-aza does demethylate the PD-1 promoter in
patients PBMNCs in vivo.

PD-1 methylation in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from 5-aza treated patients
Next, we investigated the status of PD-1 promoter
methylation in PBMNCs sampled from patients during the
course of 5-aza treatment. Initially, we analyzed unsorted
PBMNCs from 15 (12 MDS, 1 AML and 2 CMML) 5-aza
treated patients (patient characteristics, see Table 1).
Samples from day one and day five of each treatment
cycle were analyzed. The patients had received a median
number of four cycles of 5-aza (range 2–13). A total of 121
peripheral blood (PB) samples were analyzed. Nine of 15
(60%) patients demonstrated a significant decrease in PD-1
promoter methylation after 5-aza administration compared
to the pre-treatment level (Figure 2A). Demethylation was
defined relative to the baseline methylation level based on
the following criteria: A statistically significant decrease
in methylation level and a decrease of ≥ 10%-points. The
demethylation should furthermore occur in ≥ 2 distinct
treatment cycles.

PD-1 promoter methylation in CD4+ and CD8+
T cells from 5-aza treated patients
Since the observed changes in methylation level
in PBMNCs could either be a result of a real change in
methylation or simply a result of an alteration in the
composition of the mononuclear cell subpopulations, we
extended our analyses to include isolated T lymphocyte
subsets. In 22 (15 MDS, 4 AML, 3 CMML, patient
characteristics see Table 1) of the 27 patients we

investigated the PD-1 promoter methylation in sorted
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. PD-1 promoter methylation was
examined in both CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells because of
their cooperative function in tumor surveillance. Ten of the
22 patients were also included in the analyses of PBMNCs
described above.
The 22 patients had received a median number of
five courses of 5-aza (range 3–14). A total of 132 PB
samples were sorted and analyzed. Nine (41%) of the
patients demonstrated a significant decrease in PD-1
promoter methylation in the T cell compartment after 5-aza
administration (Figure 3A and 3B). In two of these patients
we only observed demethylation in either the CD4+ T
cells or the CD8+ T cells. In the remaining 13 patients an
increase in PD-1 methylation or no methylation changes
were observed (Figure 4A and 4B). The mean baseline
methylation level in T cells was significantly higher in the
group of patients in whom we observed a demethylation
of the PD-1 promoter, both compared to patients where no
demethylation were observed (48.0% (SD 15.8) vs. 25.7%
(SD 9.4) (p < .001, 95%-CI [13.1;31.5]), and compared
to healthy donors (48.0% (SD 15.8) vs. 24.5% (SD 11.1)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(p < .0001, 95%-CI [11.7;35.4])) (Figure 5). A trend
towards higher PD-1 baseline methylation in the patients’
PBMNCs and T cells compared to those of healthy donors
was observed (PBMNCs, p = 0.07; 95%-CI [−1.7;38.2] ,
T cells, p = 0.16; 95%-CI [−3.0;17.7]).
Comparison of the methylation levels in PBMNCs
and T cells from the 10 patients, where data on both cell
types were available, reveals a difference in the baseline
levels as well as a difference during treatment. In six of
the ten patients we observed a good correlation between
the relative methylation level in PBMNCs and T cells
during treatment, either occurring as demethylation
or no demethylation in both cell populations. In one
patient we observed a demethylation in PBMNCs
and CD4+ T cells but not in CD8+ T cells, and in three
patients demethylation was seen in the compound
PBMNC population; however, no demethylation was
observed in the T cells at the corresponding time points
(Supplementary Figure 1). Accordingly, changes in PD-1
methylation in PBMNCs do not always reflect the changes
in the T cell compartment, emphasizing the importance of
analyzing sorted cells.

Correlation between methylation and expression
in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from 5-aza treated
patients

To investigate whether demethylation of the
PD-1 promoter during 5-aza treatment leads to an
increased expression of PD-1, we examined the expression
of PD-1 mRNA in the same cells before and during 5-aza
treatment. The gene expression was examined in ten
patients; PD-1 promoter demethylation in CD4+ and/
or CD8+ T cells correlated with an increase in PD-1
expression. No PD-1 up-regulation was observed in the
patients without demethylation of the PD-1 promoter.
Moreover, to support the correlation between
increased PD-1 mRNA and cell surface protein
expression, we performed multiparameter flow cytometry
on PBMNCs from four patients by measuring the PD-1
expression (median fluorescence intensity, MFI) on
CD8+ T cells expressing the activating marker CD45RO

Next we compared the PD-1 gene expression to the
PD-1 promoter methylation levels in T cells from the ten
patients where corresponding values of the parameters
were available. We found a statistically significant inverse
correlation between the PD-1 promoter methylation and
expression level (p < 0.0001) (Figure 7).

respectively), whereas in patient no. 123 and 146 no increase is observed (MFI: 336 to 291 (MFIR: 0.89), and MFI: 426 to 373 (MFIR:
0.88), respectively). Correspondingly, we observed a significant demethylation of the PD-1 promoter during treatment in CD8+ T cells in
patient no. 94 and 141 (Figure 3B) and no demethylation in patient no. 123 and 146 (Figure 4B). Moreover, we saw a higher baseline MFI
of PD-1 in patient 94 compared to patient 141, which is in line with the variation in baseline methylation level.

DISCUSSION

of the PD-1 promoter in T cells and PBMNCs during 5-aza
treatment is correlated to the clinical response. A significant
difference in overall response rate (ORR) was observed
when comparing patients with and without PD-1 promoter
demethylation (Table 1). In the group of patients with PD1 promoter demethylation, only one of 12 (8%) patients
showed an overall response to 5-aza. Of the 15 patients
with no demethylation an overall response was observed in
9 patients (60%). The ORR was significantly higher in the
group of patients without PD-1 promoter demethylation
(p = 0.014). Furthermore, a trend towards longer OS was
seen in the patients without PD-1 promoter demethylation
(p = 0.11) (Supplementary Figure 2). Non-responding
patients had a significantly higher baseline PD-1 promoter
methylation compared to healthy controls (38.2% vs.
24.5%; p = 0.023, 95%-CI [2.0;25.4]) and a trend towards
a higher baseline PD-1 promoter methylation compared to
responding patients (28.5% vs. 38.2%; p = 0.096, 95%-CI
[-21.1;1.8]) (Figure 8). Taken together, these data indicate
that demethylation of the PD-1 promoter in T cells during
5-aza treatment might be associated with a poorer clinical
response to 5-aza.

Treatment with HMAs has become the standard of
care in higher-risk MDS patients who are not eligible for
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and is
also approved for CMML and AML patients with 20–30%
blasts. Even though the effects of single agent therapy with
HMAs are encouraging, remissions are not long lasting,
and novel treatment modalities are urgently needed in
MDS. Within recent years immune modulating agents
have shown promise as novel anti-cancer agents in both
experimental and clinical studies in solid tumors [24, 25].
It was recently shown that up-regulation of the
immune inhibitory receptor PD-1 on T cells during
infections is coupled to demethylation of CpG sites in the
PD-1 promoter [18]. During the development of T cells
from naïve to activated and memory T cells, the PD-1
promoter changes from methylated to unmethylated and
back to methylated again. Under normal circumstances,
demethylation of the PD-1 promoter appears to be
mediated by ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) [26].
Youngblood et al. showed that 5-aza was able to sustain

a high expression of PD-1 mRNA and protein in vitro,
indicating that DNA methylation causes PD-1 repression.
Interestingly, during chronic infections, the PD-1
promoter remains unmethylated with continuous PD-1
overexpression in the chronically activated T cells, leading
to exhausted and dysfunctional T cells [27]. Furthermore,
it appears that persistent antigen expression by malignant
tumors, like chronic infections, can promote the expression
of inhibitory surface molecules on T cells, which can cause
functional T cell exhaustion [28]. Our study suggests
that 5-aza treatment may facilitate the exhaustion of
tumor-specific T cells in patients and provides a possible
explanation for the development of 5-aza resistance.
One recent study by Yang et al. has examined the
effect of HMAs on PD-1 expression and methylation
during the first treatment cycle. In a heterogeneous cohort
of 61 patients (MDS, CMML and AML) treated with
HMAs (the majority (87%) in combination with other
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

agents) up-regulation (≥2-fold) of PD-1 gene expression
in PBMNCs was observed during the first cycle of therapy
in 58% of the patients. In a subgroup of 18 patients PD-1
promoter methylation in PBMNCs was investigated, and
the baseline methylation levels were higher in resistant
patients as compared to responding patients – a trend also
observed in the current study of sorted T cells. Moreover,
Yang et al. observed that the methylation level during
the first treatment course was more dynamic in resistant
patients as compared to responding patients [22].
Here, we have demonstrated that in vivo treatment
with 5-aza has direct impact on the expression of PD-1.
Treatment with 5-aza was accompanied by a loss of DNA
methylation in the PD-1 promoter in 44% (12 of 27) of
the patients and the methylation level of the promoter was
inversely correlated with PD-1 gene expression in T cells.
Flow cytometry analyses of the PD-1 protein expression
on CD8+ T cells supported the correlation between the

increase in PD-1 mRNA and the expression of PD-1 cell
surface protein. Our combined analyses of both PBMNCs
and sorted T cells in ten patients revealed that the PD-1
promoter methylation changes observed in the PBMNCs
do not always reflect the methylation changes in the T
cell population. This is probably due to changes in the
composition of the PBMNCs rather than changes in the
PD-1 promoter methylation, emphasizing the importance
of sorting out the relevant cells in such studies.
Interestingly, we found a significantly higher
ORR and a trend towards a better OS in patients without
demethylation of the PD-1 promoter during 5-aza
treatment. The baseline PD-1 methylation level was
significantly higher in patients where a demethylation was
observed, both compared to normal controls and to patients
where no demethylation was observed. Furthermore,
a significantly higher baseline PD-1 methylation level
was observed in non-responding patients compared
to healthy controls. In addition, we demonstrate that a
clinical relevant PD-1 demethylation is not limited to the
first treatment cycle but occurs throughout the treatment
course. Accordingly, we believe that our study, on isolated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

T cell populations and with longer follow-up time, is an
important extension to the initial findings of Yang et al.
A few studies indicate that PD-L1 and PD-L2 is
overexpressed in higher-risk MDS [22, 23] and that PDL1 may also be induced by 5-aza treatment [29]. It has
furthermore been shown that expression of PD-L1 is
an independent negative prognostic factor in different
malignancies [13, 15]. This relates to the fact that the PD-1/
PD-L1 pathway is a central mediator of T cell exhaustion (as
well as inducer of T cell apoptosis [17]). Thus, expression of
the PD-1 ligands on tumor cells appears to be an important
way of evading the specific tumor immune response. Recent
clinical trials with blockade of the PD-1 pathway have shown
significant clinical responses in solid tumors [30, 31]. The
flow cytometry data presented in this study together with
previous in vitro and murine studies [18, 23, 32] indicate
a positive correlation between PD-1 gene expression and
surface expression in vivo; thus, we believe that the observed
PD-1 demethylation and mRNA up-regulation lead to
increased PD-1 surface expression on activated T cells.
Interestingly, we show that demethylation of the
PD-1 promoter during 5-aza treatment correlates with a
9622

Oncotarget

poorer ORR. This suggests that PD-1 up-regulation in T cells
caused by 5-aza might be involved in the impaired response/
development of resistance to 5-aza treatment observed in a
substantial fraction of patients. Obviously, our findings need
validation in a larger and uniformly treated cohort. However,
this study provides an important demonstration of 5-aza
being able to up-regulate PD-1, a key immunoinhibitory
receptor, in patients’ T cells in vivo. We believe that the
observed effect of 5-aza on PD-1 may accelerate the
development of dysfunctional effector T cells leading to
primary or secondary resistance. We therefore suggest that
combination therapy with a HMA and a PD-1 pathway
inhibitor in the treatment of higher-risk MDS will release this
“brake” on the tumor-specific T cells, potentially enhancing
their function. A reinforced immune response against the
malignant blasts may improve the clinical outcomes in MDS.

by using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) densitygradient centrifugation and thereafter cryopreserved
at ~-196°C for later use. The frozen PBMNCs were
thawed and thereafter immediately separated into CD4+
and CD8+ T cells using magnetic bead-based separation
on a RoboSep device according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (StemCell Technologies). Separation of cell
subsets from the healthy donors was performed on freshly
isolated PBMNCs.

Nucleic acid extraction
Genomic DNA from MNCs was isolated using
Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA
and total RNA from separated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA
Universal Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The DNA and RNA quantity and quality
were controlled on a spectrophotometer (Eppendorf
BioPhotometer).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and treatment

Bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing

Peripheral blood (PB) was sampled from 27 patients
with MDS (n = 19), CMML (n = 3) and AML (n = 5) and 5
healthy donors. The patient samples were collected at the
Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen,
and Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, between 2008
and 2011. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical
Committee. All patients had signed informed consent
according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were
diagnosed according to the World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria [33], and the International Prognostic
Scoring System (IPSS) [34] was used to stratify the MDS
patients into risk-groups. Seven patients were classified
as IPSS intermediate-1; they all progressed before the
initiation of 5-aza treatment. The patients were treated
with 100 mg/m2 s.c. 5-aza (Vidaza, Celgene, NJ) for five
consecutive days in each 28-day cycle, according to the
Nordic MDS guidelines (http://www.nmds.org/NordicCare-Programme). PB samples were collected from each
patient before 5-aza administration on day one and day
five in each individual course of 5-aza treatment.
The clinical response to treatment was evaluated in
accordance with the revised International Working Group
(IWG) response criteria [35]. Overall response was defined
as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR),
marrow CR with hematologic improvement (HI) and stable
disease (SD) with HI. CR in the bone marrow without HI
and SD without HI were defined as no response.
Patient characteristics and response to treatment are
summarized in Table 1.

250 ng of genomic DNA was bisulfite converted
using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research) with
a slight modification. Samples were incubated at 42°C for
30 minutes instead of 37°C for 15 minutes. For the bisulfite
reaction the alternative incubation conditions described in
the appendix were used. The bisulfite-treated DNA was
amplified by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
with locus-specific primers for the PD-1 gene promoter
using PyroMark Gold master mix. Forward primer:
5′-TTTGTGGATGGTTTTATATTATGGTTATAG-3′.
Reverse primer: 5′-biotin-TCACAACCAACCCCTACC-3′.
The PCR was performed on the Gene PCR System 9700
(Applied Biosystems). PCR cycling conditions were
as follows: One cycle of 95°C for 15 min, followed
by 45 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 60°C for 20 s and 72°C
for 20 s, and one cycle of 72°C for 10 min. Methylation
analysis was done by pyrosequencing of the PD-1
promoter carried out on a PyroMark Q24 (Qiagen) using
the PyroMark Gold Q24 reagents (Qiagen), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing primer:
5′-ATTATGGTTATAGTTTTAGATTTTT-3′. The design of
the pyrosequencing assay was based on a former publication
[18]. The assay covers three CpG-sites in the upstream
DNA-sequence of the transcriptional start site of the PD-1
gene (Supplementary Figure 3) [18]. The PD-1 methylation
level for a given sample was calculated as a mean of the
methylation % of the three investigated CpG-sites.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction

Isolation of mononuclear cells and sorting of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

250 ng of total RNA was used for reverse transcrip­
tion reactions to generate cDNA using SuperScript III
Reverse Transcriptase and random hexamer primers

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were
isolated from peripheral blood immediately after sampling

(Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of
the PD-1 cDNA was performed using TaqMan assays
(id. Hs01550088_m1, Applied Biosystems) [36]. The
amplification was performed on a LightCycler 480 II
instrument. The amplification curves were analyzed
using Roche LightCycler version 1.5.1.62 software
for determination of crossing point (Cp, by the second
derivative method). All RT-qPCR assays were carried out
in duplicate and then repeated with new cDNA synthesis.
Reverse transcriptase negative cDNA synthesis reactions
were performed for at least one sample per plate. Gene
expression was normalized to endogenous GAPDH
(TaqMan assay, id. Hs99999905_m1) expression and
relative gene expression was calculated by using the
comparative threshold method (2-∆∆CT method [37])
normalized to cDNA from T cells from the same patient at
baseline of 5-aza treatment.

analyses were performed using the SAS Enterprise Guide
4.3 (SAS Institute, NC). All other statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS version 22.0.0 (IBM, NY).
Significance level was 5% and two-sided for all analyses.

References

Cryopreserved PBMNCs were thawed, incubated
with an Fc receptor blocking reagent (ChromPure Mouse
IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Suffolk, UK) to inhibit
non-specific binding before incubated with the following,
pre-titrated antibodies (all from BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA): anti-CD3 V450, anti-CD45RO FITC, anti-PD-1
(CD279) PE, and anti-CD8 AF700. Flow cytometry was
acquired by a LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences, San Diego,
CA) and data analyzed using FlowJo version 10.2 (Tree
Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Compensation was performed
using BD CompBeads (BD Biosciences). Applying gating
strategies based on unstained controls and for PD-1
the fluorescence minus one (FMO), the expression of
PD-1 was measured on CD3+/CD45RO+/CD8+ singlets
and given by the median fluorescense intensity (MFI)
(Supplementary Figure 4).

Statistical analysis
Differences in clinical characteristics for patients
with or without demethylation of the PD-1 promoter
during 5-aza treatment were compared using the Pearson
chi-squared test, or Fischer’s exact test if appropriate,
for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum
test for continuous variables. Overall survival was
analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared
using the log-rank test. Survival was measured from the
onset of 5-aza therapy. Patients who were alive were
censored at the date of last follow-up. Patients who
underwent BM transplantation were censored at the day
of transplantation. Statistically significant changes in gene
promoter methylation were assessed by a linear mixed
model (a three-level model) because of the correlation
of within-patient measurements. Regression analysis of
the association of gene promoter methylation and gene
expression was calculated using mixed models due to the
occurrence of repeated measurements. The mixed model
