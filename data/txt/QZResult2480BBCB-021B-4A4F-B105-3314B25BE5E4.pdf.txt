Abstract
Relapse of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that occurs after androgen deprivation therapy of
primary prostate cancer can be mediated by reactivation of the androgen receptor (AR). One important
mechanism mediating this AR reactivation is intratumoral conversion of the weak adrenal androgens DHEA and
androstenedione into the AR ligands testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. DHEA and androstenedione are
synthesized by the adrenals through the sequential actions of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP11A1 and
CYP17A1, so that CYP17A1 inhibitors such as abiraterone are effective therapies for CRPC. However, the
significance of intratumoral CYP17A1 and de novo androgen synthesis from cholesterol in CRPC, and the
mechanisms contributing to CYP17A1 inhibitor resistance/relapse, remain to be determined. We report that AR
activity in castration-resistant VCaP tumor xenografts can be restored through CYP17A1-dependent de novo
androgen synthesis, and that abiraterone treatment of these xenografts imposes selective pressure for increased
intratumoral expression of CYP17A1, thereby generating a mechanism for development of resistance to
CYP17A1 inhibitors. Supporting the clinical relevance of this mechanism, we found that intratumoral expression
of CYP17A1 was markedly increased in tumor biopsies from CRPC patients after CYP17A1 inhibitor therapy. We
further show that CRPC cells expressing a progesterone responsive T877A mutant AR are not CYP17A1
dependent, but that AR activity in these cells is still steroid dependent and mediated by upstream CYP11A1dependent intraturmoral pregnenolone/progesterone synthesis. Together, our results indicate that CRPCs
resistant to CYP17A1 inhibition may remain steroid dependent and therefore responsive to therapies that can
further suppress de novo intratumoral steroid synthesis. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6503–13. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The majority of prostate cancers (PCa) express androgen
receptor (AR) at high levels and respond to androgen deprivation therapies (ADT, surgical or medical castration), but
patients usually relapse within 2 to 3 years. Significantly, these
relapsed tumors (castration-resistant prostate cancer, CRPC)
express AR and androgen-regulated genes at high levels,
indicating that AR transcriptional activity has been at least
partially reactivated despite castrate serum androgen levels
(1–3). Multiple mechanisms may contribute to this AR reac-

tivation (4–6), but one significant mechanism is increased
synthesis of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by
the tumor cells from weak androgens produced by the adrenal
glands (intratumoral androgen synthesis). Normal prostate
contains the enzymatic machinery to convert weak androgens
produced by the adrenal glands, including androstenedione,
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S,
which circulates at high levels), into the physiologic high
affinity AR ligands testosterone and DHT, so prostatic testosterone and DHT levels decline less in response to castration
than do levels in serum (7–9). Moreover, intraprostatic androgen levels in castrated men with locally recurrent CRPC are
further elevated relative to serum levels, while tissue testosterone levels in metastatic CRPC may actually be higher than
in prostate prior to castration (10–13). Consistent with these
observations, expression of enzymes that convert DHEA and
androstenedione to testosterone and DHT is increased in
CRPC, with the greatest increase being in AKR1C3, the prostate enzyme that reduces androstenedione to testosterone
(2, 13).
Although these findings strongly support increased conversion of weak adrenal androgens to testosterone and DHT as a
mechanism contributing to AR reactivation in CRPC, it
has been less clear whether these tumors can produce

physiologically significant levels of androgens de novo from
cholesterol and thereby become independent of circulating
adrenal androgens. Transcripts encoding enzymes required
for de novo synthesis of steroids from cholesterol (including
CYP11A1 and CYP17A1) can be detected in PCa cell lines, and
studies in the LNCaP PCa cell line have found de novo steroid
synthesis using radioactive acetate, but the levels of testosterone were extremely low and androgen levels were not
clearly adequate to restore AR activity (14, 15). One study
of patient samples obtained through "warm autopsies" found
that CYP17A1 mRNA was increased in metastatic CRPC,
suggesting increased de novo androgen synthesis (13). However, increased CYP17A1 was not observed in other studies of
local or metastatic CRPC (1, 2, 16).
Clinical responses to adrenalectomy provided the initial
indication that adrenal derived androgens were contributing
to CRPC (17). Subsequent studies using ketoconazole, which
decreases adrenal androgens by inhibiting the enzyme
CYP17A1 that is required for DHEA and androstenedione
synthesis, have yielded substantial response rates and further
support a role for adrenal androgens in CRPC (18). A more
potent and selective CYP17A1 inhibitor, abiraterone, has
yielded higher and more durable responses in CRPC patients
(19–21), and recently received FDA approval based on a phase
III clinical trial that showed a survival advantage. Unfortunately, these abiraterone-treated patients generally relapse
within 1 year, and the recurrent tumors again express high
levels of the AR-regulated PSA gene, indicating that AR has
once again been reactivated. Significantly, adrenal gland resistance to abiraterone does not seem to be a resistance
mechanism as serum DHEA, androstenedione, or testosterone
levels are not increased at the time of relapse, and there have
been no reports of alternative resistance mechanisms in these
patients. In this study, we show that AR activity in CRPC can
be driven by CYP17A1-dependent de novo androgen synthesis,
and that treatment with CYP17A1 inhibitors selects for tumor
cells expressing increased levels of CYP17A1, providing a
mechanism for the development of resistance to CYP17A1
inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and xenografts
LNCaP and C4-2 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10%
FBS, VCaP cells were in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) with 10% FBS, and VCS2 cells were in DMEM with 8%
charcoal-dextran stripped serum (CSS)/2% FBS (Hyclone).
The former cells (LNCaP, C4-2, and VCaP) were from American Type Culture Collection and express AR and AR-regulated
genes, while the derivation of VCS2 is described here. For
androgen stimulation assays, cells were grown to 50% to 60%
confluence in medium with 5% CSS for 3 days prior to
treatment. Castration-resistant VCaP xenografts were established as described (22). To generate xenografts in female scid
mice, relapsed tumors from males were dispersed and injected
in 50% Matrigel. Abiraterone (provided as abiraterone acetate)
was from Cougar Biotechnology. RNA and protein were
extracted from frozen sections, with viable tumor confirmed

by hematoxylin and eosin staining on adjacent sections.
Intratumoral androgens were measured by mass spectroscopy
as described previously (9).
RT-PCR and immunoblotting
RNA from bone marrow biopsies replaced with tumor in
patients with CRPC were obtained as described previously (2).
Additional snap frozen samples were obtained under an IRBapproved protocol by CT-guided bone marrow biopsy from
CRPC patients treated with ketoconazole (1,200 mg/d) and
dutasteride (0.5 mg/d) for 1 month, or who were relapsing
after responding for more than 1 year. Quantitative real-time
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) amplification was with Taqman 1-step
RT-PCR reagents and results were normalized to coamplified
18S RNA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). Data shown are representative of at least 3 experiments, and significant differences are indicated. Primers and
probes are in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary
Fig. S16). Proteins were extracted by boiling for 15 minutes
in 2% SDS and detected by blotting with anti-ERG (Santa
Cruz), anti-PSA (BioDesign), anti-AR (Upstate), anti-AKR1C3
(23), anti-CYP11A1 (Abcam), anti-b-actin (Abcam), or antib-tubulin (Upstate). Band intensities relative to loading controls on low exposure gels were determined and normalized to
the no treatment controls. Gels shown are representative of at
least 3 independent experiments.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Paraffin sections underwent antigen retrieval and were then
blocked using 5% goat serum and avidin blocking solution
(Vector). Anti-AR (Santa Cruz), anti-ERG (Santa Cruz), antiPSA (Abcam), or anti-Ki67 (Dako) were then added overnight
at 4 C, followed by biotinylated secondary antibody and
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Vector). Sections compared in each figure were stained at the same time and
photographed under identical conditions.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells were formalin fixed, lysed and sonicated to break the
chromatin into 500 to 800 bp fragments. Anti-AR or rabbit IgG
(Santa Cruz) were used to precipitate chromatin and qRT-PCR
was used to analyze binding to the PSA enhancer or an
irrelevant locus (primers are in Supplementary Fig. S16).

Results
VCaP PCa cells have substantial basal AR
transcriptional activity
VCaP cells, derived from a vertebral metastasis in a patient
with CRPC, express wild-type AR and AR-regulated genes such
as PSA and the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene (24). Although
androgen responsive, VCaP cells, like C4-2 cells (derived from
an LNCaP xenograft that relapsed after castration), express
substantial basal levels of the AR-regulated PSA gene when
cultured in steroid-depleted serum (Fig. 1A). This basal AR
activity was not from residual androgens in the serum, as it
was similarly observed in serum-free medium (Supplementary
Fig. S1). VCaP also had substantial nuclear AR under these

Figure 1. VCaP cells have substantial basal AR activity. A, VCaP, LNCaP, or C4-2 cells grown in medium with 5% charcoal-dextran stripped fetal bovine serum
(CSS) were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 nmol/L DHT for 24 hours and then immunoblotted for PSA and b-actin (loading control). The number on top of
each lane is band intensity compared with loading control, which is then normalized to the untreated lane. B, VCaP or LNCaP cells in CSS medium
were treated with 10 nmol/L DHT for 0, 0.5, or 4 hours and then fractionated into nuclear extracts (NE) or cytoplasmic extracts (CE). NE, CE or whole cell lysates
were immunoblotted for AR, b-tubulin (cytoplasm control), or b-actin (loading control). Blots shown were from the same gel. C, VCaP or LNCaP cells
in CSS medium were treated with 0, 1, or 10 nmol/L DHT for 4 hours and then subjected to ChIP assay. The DNA fragments were PCR amplified and normalized
to input to measure binding to the PSA enhancer ARE or irrelevant site (negative control). D, androgen synthesis pathway. E, LNCaP, C4-2, or VCaP cells were
subjected to real-time qRT-PCR to measure CYP17A1, AKR1C3, HSD3B2, CYP11A1, SRD5A1, HSD17B3, or HSD17B6 (major enzyme mediating the
regeneration of DHT from its reduced metabolite). Equal amounts of cellular RNA were coamplified with 18S RNA as an internal control.

conditions, consistent with the basal PSA expression, which
was increased by DHT (Fig. 1B). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) further showed that substantial AR in VCaP
cells, but not LNCaP cells, was bound to the androgenresponsive element (ARE) in the PSA gene enhancer in the
absence of exogenous androgens (Fig. 1C).
To determine whether de novo (from cholesterol) steroid
synthesis may contribute to this basal AR activity in VCaP or
C4-2 cells, we next accessed the expression of steroid biosynthetic enzymes (Fig. 1D). Transcripts encoding each enzyme
were readily detected and moderately higher in C4-2 versus
LNCaP, while VCaP had markedly higher expression of
AKR1C3 and HSD17B6, but lower CYP11A1 compared with
C4-2 and LNCaP cells (Fig. 1E). Together these findings
suggested that basal AR activity in VCaP and C4-2 cells
may be mediated by CYP17A1-dependent de novo androgen
synthesis.

cells, but not C4-2 cells (Fig. 2A). This block could be overcome
by an androgen precursor that is downstream of CYP17A1,
androstenedione, indicating that it was due to CYP17A1
blockade and not a toxic effect (Fig. 2B). Abiraterone, a more
specific CYP17A1 inhibitor, similarly decreased basal PSA and
ERG (from the AR-regulated TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene) expression in VCaP cells, but not in C4-2 cells, further indicating
that basal AR activity in VCaP, but not C4-2, was CYP17A1
dependent (Fig. 2C). AR protein in VCaP cells was also
decreased by abiraterone, consistent with the decreased stability of the unliganded AR. Confocal microscopy further
showed that AR nuclear expression in VCaP cells in the
absence of exogenous androgens was blocked by abiraterone
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Abiraterone also blocked PSA expression in VCaP cells induced by progesterone, an upstream
CYP17A1 substrate, confirming the CYP17A1-dependent conversion of progesterone to physiologically significant levels of
androgens (Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, PSA expression stimulated by androstenedione (downstream of
CYP17A1) was not blocked by abiraterone (Fig. 2D).
RT-PCR further established that abiraterone was decreasing expression of AR-regulated transcripts encoding PSA,

Figure 2. Basal AR activity in VCaP is dependent on CYP17A1. A, VCaP, LNCaP, or C4-2 cells in CSS medium were treated with 0, 2, or 5 mmol/L ketoconazole
(Keto) for 24 hours and then immunoblotted. B, VCaP cells in CSS medium were treated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 nmol/L androstenedione (Ad) with or
without 2 mmol/L ketoconazole for 24 hours. C, VCaP or C4-2 cells in CSS medium were treated with 0, 2, or 5 mmol/L abiraterone (Abir) for 24 hours. D, VCaP
cells in CSS medium were treated with 0 or 100 nmol/L androstenedione with or without 2 mmol/L abiraterone and then immunoblotted or (E) subjected to

and then harvested for steroid measurements. Each bar represents a biological replicate. G, tissue samples of recurrent VCaP xenogafts were taken from each

be bypassed by androstenedione (Fig. 2E). Finally, to confirm
that abiraterone was reducing intracellular androgen synthesis, we measured androgen levels in untreated versus
abiraterone treated VCaP cells cultured in steroid depleted
medium. As shown in Figure 2F, abiraterone decreased DHT
and testosterone levels, but did not prevent the increase in
DHT and testosterone when androstenedione was added to

synthesize testosterone and DHT de novo at levels that are
adequate to drive AR transcriptional activity.
Rodent adrenal glands express low or undetectable levels
of CYP17, so serum levels of testosterone and androgen
precursors are extremely low in castrated male and in female
mice (25). In a previous study, we showed that VCaP

transcriptional activity and had increased expression of
androgen synthetic genes including AKR1C3, but CYP17A1
was not consistently increased (22). To assess the effects of
inhibiting CYP17A1 in vivo, castration-resistant VCaP xenografts were transplanted into female mice. Established
tumors in each mouse were biopsied, and the mice were
then treated with 0.5 mg abiraterone intraperitoneally (i.p.)
every other day for 8 days. Comparison of mRNA from
pre- and posttreatment tumors showed that abiraterone
decreased the expression of multiple androgen-regulated
genes (PSA, TMPRSS2, and ERG), but did not decrease AR
mRNA, consistent with decreased AR transcriptional activity
(Fig. 2G). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also indicated decreased PSA protein and decreased nuclear ERG and AR
after abiraterone treatment (Fig. 2H and Supplementary
Fig. S4). Moreover, Ki67-positive cells were greatly decreased
in the abiraterone-treated tumors (62% mean decrease),
indicating that tumor growth was suppressed (Fig. 2G
and Supplementary Fig. S5). Measurement of androgen
levels in tumors pre- and posttreatment confirmed that
testosterone and DHT were decreased by abiraterone
(Fig. 2I).

Basal AR activity in VCaP cells and castration-resistant
VCaP xenografts is AKR1C3 dependent
Previously, we showed that AKR1C3, the prostatic enzyme
mediating reduction of androstenedione to testosterone, was
increased in human CRPC biopsies relative to primary PCa (2),
and that its expression was increased in VCaP xenografts that
had relapsed after castration (22). AKR1C3 mRNA was also
much higher in VCaP than LNCaP or C4-2 cells (Fig. 1E), while
at the protein level AKR1C3 was only detected in VCaP cells
(Fig. 3A). As specific AKR1C3 inhibitors are not yet available,
we generated stable AKR1C3 knockdown cells by infecting
VCaP cells with an AKR1C3 short hair-pin RNA (shRNA)
lentivirus. PSA in the absence of DHT was dramatically
decreased in VCaP-shAKR1C3 cells, and could be restored
by DHT (Fig. 3B). In contrast, androstenedione, a very weak
direct AR agonist, only minimally increased PSA in the VCaPshAKR1C3 cells (Fig. 3C), confirming that AKR1C3 was mediating the synthesis of physiologically significant levels of
testosterone from androstenedione. Although not selective,
the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug indomethacin
at micromolar concentrations can also inhibit AKR1C3
(26, 27). Similarly to the effect of shAKR1C3, indomethacin

Figure 3. Basal AR activity in VCaP is AKR1C3 dependent. A, LNCaP, C4-2, or VCaP cells were immunoblotted for AKR1C3 or b-tubulin (loading control). B
and C, VCaP cells stably infected with lentivirus expressing either GFP shRNA or AKR1C3 shRNA (Open Biosystems) in CSS medium were treated
with 10 nmol/L DHT or 100 nmol/L androstenedione (Ad) for 24 hours, and then immunoblotted. D, VCaP or C4-2 cells in CSS medium were treated with 0, 20,
or 40 mmol/L indomethacin for 24 hours. E, VCaP cells in CSS medium were treated with 0, 20, or 40 mmol/L indomethacin with or without 10 nmol/L
DHT and subjected to qRT-PCR. F, mice bearing relapsed VCaP xenografts were treated with indomethacin for 2 weeks (0.25 mg/d in drinking water) and
tissue samples taken pre- and posttherapy from tumors (n ¼ 5) were analyzed by RT-PCR as indicated or (G) by IHC for PSA, ERG, AR, and Ki67. H,
testosterone and DHT levels in recurrent xenograft tumors in transplanted female scid mice (n ¼ 3) were measured pre- or postindomethacin (Indo) treatment.

decreased basal and androstenedione stimulated PSA expression in VCaP cells, but not in C4-2 cells (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S6). RT-PCR confirmed that indomethacin was
decreasing mRNA levels of PSA, TMPRSS2, and PLZF, and that
this effect could be bypassed by DHT (Fig. 3E).
To examine the effects of inhibiting AKR1C3 in vivo in
castration resistant VCaP xenografts, we castrated another
series of male mice bearing VCaP xenografts. Consistent with
previous results, qRT-PCR of tumor samples taken pre- and
postcastration and at relapse showed renewed expression of
AR-regulated genes and increased expression of AR mRNA in
the castration-resistant VCaP xenografts (Supplementary
Fig. S7). IHC on serial biopsies also confirmed that cytoplasmic expression of AKR1C3 protein was rapidly increased
after castration (although this increase clearly was not adequate to restore AR activity) and was further increased in the
relapsed tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8).
To inhibit AKR1C3 in these castrated male mice bearing
relapsed VCaP xenografts, we then treated the mice for
2 weeks with indomethacin, which resulted in decreased
PSA, ERG, and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression (Fig. 3F). AR
mRNA was slightly decreased, although this was not significant and was not seen in vitro in VCaP cells (Supplementary
Fig. S9). IHC also indicated decreased PSA and ERG protein,
decreased nuclear expression of ERG and AR, and a significant
decrease in Ki67-positive cells (mean 31% decrease in Ki67positive cells) in response to indomethacin (Fig. 3G and
Supplementary Figs. S10 and 11). Finally, consistent with
AKR1C3 inhibition, testosterone and DHT levels were decreased in the treated tumors (Fig. 3H). It should be noted

that abiraterone was more effective than indomethacin in
suppressing androgen levels, but was less effective at reducing
expression of AR-regulated genes (Fig. 2I vs. 3F). This could
reflect some additional activities of indomethacin, but also
may be related to other factors including the in vivo half-life of
the drugs and transcripts.
AR reactivation in castration-resistant VCaP cell line is
dependent on de novo androgen synthesis
Although the above results indicated that AR activity in the
relapsed VCaP xenografts was being driven by CYP17A1 and
AKR1C3-dependent de novo intratumoral androgen synthesis,
we could not rule out completely the possibility that the
tumors were generating androgens from very low levels
precursor steroids in the serum. To address this point, we
used a relapsed VCaP xenograft to generate a castrationresistant VCaP cell line (VCS2). Significantly, AR transcriptional activity in steroid-depleted medium, as assessed by PSA
expression, was markedly increased in these VCS2 cells compared with the parental VCaP cells, and was only weakly
further induced by DHT (Fig. 4A). It should be noted that
the decrease in AR protein levels after 24 hours of DHT
treatment in both VCaP and VCS2 cells is due to a decrease
in AR gene transcription mediated by the agonist-liganded AR
(data not shown).
Consistent with this increased basal AR activity, expression
of AR and androgen synthetic enzymes were increased in the
VCS2 cells (Fig. 4A and B). An increase in CYP17A1 protein was
also confirmed by immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S12).
PSA expression in the VCS2 cells could be markedly decreased

Figure 4. Inhibition of CYP17A1 and AKR1C3 suppresses AR activity in a castration-resistant VCaP cell line. A, the VCS2 cells generated from a relapsed VCaP
xenograft were passaged in culture in 8% CSS/2% FBS medium. VCaP and VCS2 cells were switched to CSS medium for 3 days, then treated for
1 day with 0, 1, or 10 nmol/L DHT, and proteins were then immunoblotted. Long (L) and short (S) exposures are shown for PSA. PSA protein is quantified
relative to VCaP with no added DHT. B, VCaP or VCS2 cells were subjected to qRT-PCR to measure CYP17A1, AKR1C3, or HSD3B2. C, VCS2 cells
in CSS medium were treated for 24 hours with 0, 20, or 40 mmol/L indomethacin and then immunoblotted. D, VCS2 cells in CSS medium were transfected with
20 nmol/L AKR1C3 siRNA (Dharmacon) for 2 days and then treated for 24 hours with vehicle (ethanol) or 10 nmol/L DHT and immunoblotted for
PSA and AKR1C3. E, VCS2 cells in CSS medium were treated for 24 hours with 0, 2, or 5 mmol/L abiraterone and then immunoblotted. F, VCS2 cells
in CSS medium were treated for 24 hours with abiraterone (2 mmol/L) and indomethacin (20 or 40 mmol/L) as indicated and then immunoblotted (note longer
exposure compared with E).

by indomethacin (Fig. 4C) and by AKR1C3 siRNA (Fig. 4D),
confirming that the high level basal PSA expression was
AKR1C3 dependent. Basal PSA expression was also markedly
suppressed by abiraterone (Fig. 4E), and could be even further
suppressed by combined abiraterone and indomethacin treatment (Fig. 4F), confirming that reactivated AR activity in these
castration-resistant tumors is dependent on enhanced
CYP17A1 and AKR1C3-dependent intratumoral de novo androgen synthesis.
Intratumoral CYP11A1-dependent pregnenolone/
progesterone synthesis drives CYP17A1-independent
AR activity in cells expressing progesterone responsive
T877A mutant AR
In contrast to VCaP cells, C4-2 cells express very low levels
of AKR1C3 and their basal AR activity was not blocked by
CYP17A1 or AKR1C3 inhibitors (see Figures 1–3). Significantly,
LNCaP and C4-2 cells express a mutant AR (T877A) that can
be stimulated by certain AR antagonists and steroids including progesterone that do not substantially activate wild-type
AR (Fig. 5A; refs. 28, 29). Indeed, both DHT and progesterone
strongly stimulated endogenous AR activity in LNCaP cells,
and were more potent than androstenedione or testosterone
(Fig. 5B). These observations, in conjunction with increased
levels of CYP11A1 mRNA (Fig. 1E) and protein (Supplementary
Fig. S13) in C4-2 cells, suggested that basal AR activity in C4-2
cells may be driven by progesterone, which is synthesized from
cholesterol upstream of CYP17A1 by the sequential actions of
CYP11A1 and HSD3B1 or HSD3B2 (see Figure 1D).
To test this hypothesis, we first examined high passage
number LNCaP cells (LN-HP cells) that express substantial
PSA in steroid-depleted medium. As shown in Figure 5C,
stable infection with a CYP11A1 shRNA lentivirus markedly
decreased basal PSA mRNA, and this was prevented by DHT or
progesterone. Interestingly, although CYP11A1 has not been
characterized as an AR-regulated gene, its expression also was
increased by progesterone and DHT. Immunoblotting confirmed the marked decrease in basal PSA in response to
CYP11A1 shRNA, which could be restored with DHT
(Fig. 5D). In C4-2 cells, basal levels of AR-regulated transcripts
(PSA, PLZF, and FKBP5) and PSA protein expression were
similarly decreased by CYP11A1 shRNA, and could be restored
by DHT or progesterone (Fig. 5E and F). Finally, CYP11A1
shRNA decreased C4-2 cell growth in steroid-depleted medium and restored the ability of DHT to androgen stimulate
their growth (Fig. 5G). Together these findings indicate that
CYP11A1-dependent intratumoral synthesis of progesterone is
driving the high levels of AR activity in these cells with a T877A
mutant AR.
Increased CYP17A1-dependent intratumoral de novo
androgen synthesis mediates resistance to CYP17A1
inhibitors
To gain insight into possible mechanisms of acquired
resistance to CYP17A1 inhibition, we treated a series of
mice bearing castration-resistant VCaP xenografts with
abiraterone. All mice responded initially (see Figure 2),
and there was no substantial or consistent change in

www.aacrjournals.org

CYP17A1 expression in the responding xenografts from mice
sacrificed after 8 days of treatment (Fig. 6A). We then
biopsied another group of castration-resistant VCaP xenografts and then treated with abiraterone until relapse based
on renewed rapid growth after 4 to 6 weeks. PSA expression,
which declined initially in response to abiraterone, returned
to levels that were close to or above baseline, indicating
restored AR activity (Fig. 6B). IHC also showed strong
nuclear AR expression in the relapsed tumors, consistent
with AR reactivation (Supplementary Fig. S14). Changes in
the expression of AKR1C3 and AR were modest and variable
(Fig. 6B), and no AR ligand–binding domain mutations were
detected by cDNA sequencing (not shown). In contrast,
CYP17A1 expression was increased in all relapsed xenografts, with increases of more than 10-fold in 2 of the
xenografts (Fig. 6B). This selection for tumors cells with
elevated CYP17A1 in response to abiraterone treatment
indicates that upregulation of CYP17A1 provides a growth
advantage and is a mechanism that can contribute to the
development of abiraterone resistance.
We reported previously that mRNA for enzymes-mediating
conversion of weak adrenal androgens (DHEA and androstenedione) to testosterone and DHT (including HSD17B2,
AKR1C3, and SRD5A1) were increased in metastatic CRPC
clinical samples (2). There was also an increase in median
CYP11A1, but CYP17A1 was not increased (Fig. 6C), suggesting
that these tumors may not carry out significant de novo
androgen synthesis or that CYP17A1 is not rate limiting. To
address these alternatives, we used real-time qRT-PCR to
directly compare expression of CYP17A1 in CRPC clinical
samples versus castration-resistant VCaP xenografts. Significantly, median CYP17A1 levels in the CRPC clinical samples
and castration-resistant VCaP xenografts (VCaP-CR) were
comparable, while median CYP11A1 was higher in the CRPC
samples, indicating that many or most of the clinical samples
expressed these enzymes at levels that were consistent with
physiologically significant levels of androgen synthesis and AR
reactivation (Fig. 6D).
Although our data indicate that CYP17A1 mRNA is not
consistently increased in CRPC, this may reflect the availability of circulating weak androgens produced by the adrenal
glands. Therefore, to determine whether suppression of adrenal gland steroid synthesis in CRPC patients through treatment with a CYP17A1 inhibitor selects for tumor cells with
increased CYP17A1, we next examined tumor samples
obtained from bone marrow biopsies in CRPC patients treated
with high dose ketoconazole (CYP17A1 inhibitor) and dutasteride (5a-reductase inhibitor; ref. 30). Biopsies from 4 patients
obtained after 1 month of treatment (P1–P4), when serum PSA
levels were declining, and from 2 patients who were relapsing
after responding to ketoconazole for more than 1 year, all
showed levels of CYP17A1 mRNA that were markedly higher
than the median expression in biopsies from CRPC patients
who were not being treated with a CYP17A1 inhibitor (Fig. 6D;
each circle reflects the level measured in an independent
biopsy taken from the same region). In contrast, there
were no apparent further increases in AKR1C3 or CYP11A1
expression.

LNCaP cell line (>50, LN-HP) was stably infected with lentivirus expressing either GFP shRNA or CYP11A1 shRNA (Open Biosystems), then
treated with vehicle (ethanol), 10 nmol/L DHT, or 10 nmol/L progesterone, and analyzed by qRT-PCR for PSA and CYP11A1. D, LN-HP cells infected with
GFP or AKR1C3 shRNA lentivirus were treated with 0, 1, 10 nmol/L DHT and immunoblotted. E, C4-2 cells stably infected with lentivirus expressing either
GFP shRNA or CYP11A1 shRNA were treated with 0, 1, 10 nmol/L DHT and analyzed by RT-PCR or (F) treated with 0, 1, 10 nmol/L progesterone and

MTT assay after 7 days.

Discussion
Normal prostate expresses enzymes that can maintain high
intraprostatic androgen levels by converting weak adrenal
androgens (DHEA and androstenedione) into testosterone
and DHT, and it is becoming clear that increased intratumoral
expression of these enzymes is a major mechanism contributing to AR reactivation in CRPC. However, it has not been

6510

Cancer Res; 71(20) October 15, 2011

clear whether CRPC can synthesize de novo physiologically
significant levels of androgens. In this study, we showed that
AR activity in castration-resistant VCaP xenografts was driven
by CYP17A1 and AKR1C3-dependent intratumoral de novo
androgen synthesis. Moreover, we found that CYP17A1 expression in CRPC clinical samples was comparable with the
levels in these castration-resistant VCaP xenografts, supporting the conclusion that CRPC cells can mediate levels of

Prostate Cancer Resistance to CYP17A1 Inhibitors

Figure 6. CYP17A1 inhibition in CRPC selects for increased CYP17A1. A, mice bearing recurrent VCaP xenografts were treated with abiraterone for a short
period (n ¼ 4, 0.5 mg/d for 8 days by i.p. injection) or (B) for extended periods until relapse (n ¼ 6, 0.1 mg/mL in drinking water, which was changed
every 3 days, for 4–6 weeks). RNA extracted from tumor samples pre- or posttreatment was analyzed by qRT-PCR with GAPDH coamplified as an
internal control. The change of gene expression was presented as Log2 (fold change). C, affymetrix microarray expression data for CYP17A1 and CYP11A1
in 27 primary tumors (no hormonal therapy) and 29 CRPC bone marrow metastases. D, expression of CYP17A1, AKR1C3, and CYP11A1 were
assessed by qRT-PCR in 29 CRPC bone marrow biopsy tumor samples, 3 relapsed castration resistant VCaP xenografts (VCaP-CR), 3 relapsed
castration resistant LNCaP xenografts (LN-CR), 2 to 3 bone marrow biopsy tumor samples each from 6 ketoconazole-treated patient (P1–P6), and 4
bone marrow biopsy samples from CRPC patients that contained only normal bone marrow (NBM), with GAPDH amplified as an internal control.

de novo androgen synthesis that are adequate to restore AR
transcriptional activity. Interestingly, many of the CRPC
tumors expressing the lowest levels of CYP17A1 had higher
levels of CYP11A1 (Supplementary Fig. S15), suggesting that
modest increases in either enzyme, in conjunction with the
substantial levels of adrenal-derived DHEA that remain after
surgical or medical castration, may be adequate to support AR
activity in CRPC prior to therapy with a CYP17A1 inhibitor.
We further showed that treatment of castration-resistant
VCaP xenografts with a CYP17A1 inhibitor, abiraterone, selected for relapsed tumors with increased CYP17A1 expression. Significantly, tumor biopsies from CRPC patients treated
with ketoconazole (a CYP17A1 inhibitor) and dutasteride (a
type 1 and 2 5a-reductase inhibitor) for 1 month or until
relapse similarly had markedly increased levels of CYP17A1
relative to the levels in CRPC prior to CYP17A1 inhibitor
therapy. Together these findings indicate that treatment of
CRPC patients with a CYP17A1 inhibitor, by markedly decreasing the levels of circulating weak androgens, generates
strong selective pressure for increasing CYP17A1 expression
and intratumoral de novo steroid synthesis. Although biopsy
samples from patients failing abiraterone are not yet available
for analysis, we predict that many of these tumors will also
have marked increases in CYP17A1 and may have become
dependent on increased intratumoral de novo steroid synthesis. Importantly, such tumors may respond to higher doses of
abiraterone or to the addition of agents suppressing other
steps in androgen synthesis. In support of this approach,

www.aacrjournals.org

results from 2 recent small trials indicate that responses to
ketoconazole may be enhanced by the addition of dutasteride
(5a-reductase inhibitor; refs. 29, 41), although it remains to be
determined whether dutasteride or related drugs can enhance
the efficacy of more potent CYP17A1 inhibitors such as
abiraterone.
Previous studies carried out primarily in LNCaP PCa cells
and xenografts showed that cholesterol synthesis and metabolism were increased as tumors progressed after androgen deprivation, and that these cells expressed the enzymes
required for de novo androgen synthesis from cholesterol (14,
15, 31–33). Studies using radiolabeled acetic acid in relapsed
LNCaP xenografts explants further showed detectable DHT
synthesis (although progesterone was found at higher levels
and testosterone was low or not clearly detected), but
whether this DHT was adequate to drive AR activation
was not determined (14). Consistent with the relatively high
level expression of CYP11A1 and progesterone synthesis in
LNCaP cells, we found that basal AR activity in LNCaP and
C4-2 cells was CYP11A1 dependent, but CYP17A1 independent, indicating that intratumoral synthesis of progesterone
is driving activity of the T877A mutant AR in these cells. We
showed previously that treatment with the AR antagonist
flutamide selects for tumor cells expressing mutant ARs
(including the T877A mutation) with altered ligand-binding
domains that are activated by flutamide (29, 34, 35). Therefore, our data suggest that increased levels of progesterone
(or other steroids that accumulate in response to CYP17A1

inhibition) may select for such ligand-binding domain mutations in a subset of patients.
Although these data support de novo intratumoral steroid
synthesis as a mechanism contributing to AR reactivation in
CRPC and resistance to CYP17A1 inhibitors, additional
mechanisms that sensitize AR to very low androgen levels or
render it ligand independent, including alternative splicing that
truncates the AR ligand–binding domain (36–41), may also
make substantial contributions. Consistent with the ligand
dependence of basal AR activity in the VCaP and castrationresistant VCaP cells, we have not yet observed lower molecular
weight isoforms of AR protein (not shown). However, it is
possible that very low levels of these isoforms could function
as coactivators, and that alternative AR splicing may emerge as a
significant contributor to restoration of AR activity in tumors
that relapse after CYP17A1 inhibitor therapy.In any case, further
molecular analyses of CYP17A1 inhibitor resistant/relapsed
tumors will be critical to identify mechanisms of resistance
in individual patients and to develop and deploy individualized
therapies that target these resistance mechanisms.
