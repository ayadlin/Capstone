BACKGROUND. Administration of salvage chemotherapy to patients with relapsed
or refractory lymphoma is associated with significant toxicity. Vinorelbine and
gemcitabine are novel chemotherapeutic agents with minimal overlapping toxicity. We present a phase 2 study of vinorelbine and gemcitabine with or without
ifosfamide administered in an ambulatory care setting for relapsed or refractory
lymphoma.

METHODS. Ninety patients were enrolled. Group 1 comprised patients with
‘‘good’’ risk disease, Group 2 comprised patients with ‘‘high’’ risk disease, and
Group 3 comprised patients relapsing after prior stem cell transplant. Patients in
Group 1 and Group 3 received vinorelbine and gemcitabine with filgrastim support (VGF); those in Group 2 received the above regimen with ifosfamide (FGIV).

RESULTS. Toxicities were acceptable. Febrile neutropenia was uncommon: 7% afsions occurred in 23 of 107 cycles (21%) after VGF and 50 of 148 (34%) after
50%, with median overall survival of 28, 9 and 30 months.

CONCLUSIONS. Vinorelbine-based and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is effective in the salvage setting against lymphoma and can be administered in an ambulatory setting. Cancer 2008;113:3192–8.  2008 American Cancer Society.

he prevalence of lymphoma is rapidly increasing in the industrialized world and it has been estimated that by 2020, the incidence will approach that of non–small cell lung cancer.1,2 Although
many patients achieve excellent long-term outcomes after treatment
with established first-line regimens, a significant proportion are refractory to primary therapy, or relapse after initial response, and
have a poorer prognosis.3-5 Despite the finding that many patients
retain sensitivity to alternative salvage chemotherapy regimens, survival using these therapies alone for high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is below 10% and 20%,

respectively, at 5 years.6 As such, for patients with
ongoing chemosensitivity, high-dose chemotherapy
conditioned autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT) as a consolidative approach is currently
regarded as the optimal strategy and is curative in a
significant proportion of patients.7,8 In patients
planned for ASCT, it is therefore important to try to
avoid excessive prior toxicity, similarly, for patients
unsuitable for ASCT, where salvage therapy alone is
unlikely to be curative,9,10 it is preferable to avoid
hospitalization and regimen-related toxicities.
Vinorelbine and gemcitabine have been shown,
as single agents, to have efficacy in the treatment of
patients with heavily pretreated lymphoma.11,12
Vinorelbine is a semisynthetic Vinca alkaloid which
inhibits microtubule synthesis,13 whereas gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog of deoxycytidine which
undergoes intracellular activation.14 The agents have
differing mechanisms for activity and little overlapping toxicity, and can both be administered in the
outpatient setting via short intravenous infusions.
Preliminary evidence of single-agent efficacy and satisfactory tolerability for gemcitabine against relapsed
and refractory lymphoma has seen it incorporated
into treatment combinations.15,16 Combination therapy with vinorelbine and gemcitabine has been
found to be effective in the management of
advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer,17 and we have
previously shown that the combination of vinorelbine and gemcitabine is an effective and tolerable
salvage approach for both NHL and HL with overall
response rates of 70%, and 47%, for patients in first
relapse or with more advanced disease, respectively.18 Combinations of gemcitabine and vinorelbine with liposomal doxorubicin (GND) have been
used successfully for the salvage of Hodgkin
disease.19 Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent, with
established efficacy in combination chemotherapy
regimens for lymphoma.20 Outpatient administration
of ifosfamide, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine (IGEV)
has been found to be an effective salvage approach
in a series of 91 patients with relapsed/refractory
Hodgkin lymphoma, with an overall response rate of
83.3%, with few treatment-related toxicities and
effective facilitation of stem cell mobilization.21
We present the results of a multicenter, phase 2
prospective study, conducted between December
2002 and December 2004, evaluating the performance in an ambulatory care setting of vinorelbine
and gemcitabine incorporating a risk-adapted strategy, rigorous mid-treatment evaluation, and early
dose escalation for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory interim responses.

*Patients were prehydrated, given Mesna 600 mg/m2 in 100 mL normal saline over 15 minutes, and
discharged with oral Mesna 1.2 g/m2 to be taken at 2 and 6 hours after completion of ifosfamide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were eligible if they were older than 17 years,
had relapsed or primary refractory HL or NHL, and
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 0, 1, or 2. Patients with impaired renal (serum creatinine greater than twice the upper limit of
normal), hepatic (bilirubin greater than twice the
upper limit of normal), or hemopoietic (neutrophil
count below 0.5 3 109/L and/or platelets below 50 3
109/L) function were excluded unless the impairment
was considered directly due to lymphoma. Those
who had relapsed within 6 months of a stem cell
transplant procedure were also excluded.
Patients were stratified into 3 groups. Group 1 comprised ‘‘good risk’’ patients in first relapse, after a durable
first complete remission, defined as a remission longer
than 12 months for follicular (FL) NHL,22 or beyond 6
months for all other subtypes of NHL and HL. Group 2
comprised patients with ‘‘poor risk’’ disease, who were
either primary refractory, or had relapsed within 12
months (for FL NHL) or 6 months (for all other NHL
subtypes and HL) of initial therapy,23 or were in second
or subsequent relapse and had not previously undergone any form of transplantation procedure. Group 3
comprised post-transplant patients who had relapsed at
least 6 months after prior ASCT.
Treatment Schedule
All 3 regimens were administered as 21-day cycles,
using a central venous device when available. Table 1
outlines the VGF (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, filgrastim) and FGIV (addition of ifosfamide to VGF) regimens. Treatment was administered in outpatient
chemotherapy facilities unless therapy was initiated
during an inpatient admission. Four cycles of treatment were planned. Patients in Groups 1 and 3 com-

menced therapy with the less aggressive VGF regimen. It was anticipated that some patients in Group
1 would respond to the gentler regimen alone.
Patients in Group 2 commenced with the more intensive FGIV regimen, to attempt rapid control of
their highly aggressive disease. Patients in Group 3
received the less aggressive VGF regimen to minimize
excess toxicity given their prior history of ASCT.

Interim response assessments and escalation
After 2 cycles, all patients underwent re-evaluation
with complete physical examination as well as repeat
of previously positive imaging-computerized tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as functional imaging (gallium or positron emission
tomography) if undertaken at baseline. Patients were
considered to have achieved a satisfactory interim
response if they had at least a 50% reduction in tumor
bulk at all previous sites of measurable disease and
negative functional imaging at previously avid sites.
Those with a satisfactory response continued the current regimen to a total of 4 cycles, whereas those with
inadequate response (ie, <50% reduction in disease
burden or residual positive functional imaging) were
escalated (VGF to FGIV or FGIV to IVAC). (IVAC
required inpatient administration: Day 1-5: etoposide
60 mg/m2; ifosfamide 1.5 g/m2. Day 1-2: cytarabine 2
g/m2 12 hourly [4 doses]. Day 6: Pegfilgrastim 6 mg
subcutaneously.24) After 4 cycles of therapy, patients
were restaged and final response was classified according to current international guidelines for assessing
lymphoma response.25 Patients were able to exit the
study after the second cycle to undergo ASCT at the
discretion of their attending physician, and any
patients found to have stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) were also removed from the study.
Toxicity assessment
Hematologic and nonhematologic toxic effects of
therapy were graded after each cycle of treatment
according to the adapted World Health Organization
grading system.26 Dose reduction was permitted on
the basis of clinical and laboratory parameters before
Day 1 treatment; dose reduction was not permitted
on the basis of Day 8 hematological parameters.
Treatment was withheld if the neutrophil count was
below 0.5 3 109/L or platelet count below 50 3 109/
L, and treatment was reduced by 25% if these values
were between 0.5 3 109/L to 1.0 3 109/L or 50 3
109/L 100 3 109/L, respectively.
Statistical Methodology
Sample size was calculated based on an a of 0.05, a
power of 0.90, and a postulated proportion of desired

response of 35% against a hypothetical of 20%. All
adverse events were graded according to the adapted
World Health Organization recommendations.26 Key
data (demographics and disease history) were collected for all patients. For continuous variables, summary measures included the mean, standard
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum; for categorical variables, frequency tables were generated; for
time-to-event variables, progression-free survival (PFS)
and overall survival (OS), Kaplan-Meier survival was
calculated, including estimates of 4-year survival. Survival estimates were summarized by prognostic and
disease groups, as well as between transplanted and
nontransplanted cohorts. An exploratory comparison
of survival between patients with positive and negative
functional imaging at interim evaluation was planned.
All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis.

Ethics Considerations
The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee or
equivalent at each participating center, and each
patient provided written informed consent.

RESULTS
Ninety patients were enrolled between December
2002 and December 2004, through 10 centers around
Australia. The baseline characteristics of these
patients are described in Table 2. There were 49 males

and 41 females in the cohort. Figure 1 outlines the
course and response of the enrolled patients. In
Group 1, at final restaging overall response rate was
77% (complete response 42% and partial response
35%). In Group 2, the overall response rate at restaging was 39% (complete response 21% and partial
response 18%). This was a heavily pretreated group
(median previous therapies 5 3) and removal from
study because of toxicity or progressive disease was
frequent (n 5 30). In Group 3, 12 patients com-

menced VGF. At restaging, the overall response rate
seen was 50% (complete response 8% and partial
response 42%).
Of the 43 patients with a diagnosis of diffuse large
B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), response, as evaluated after
cycle 4 was seen in 12 patients (complete response in
7, partial response in 5). Of the 13 patients in Group 1
with DLBCL, response was seen in 5 patients (complete response in 4, partial response in 1). Of 24
patients with DLBCL in Group 2, response was seen
after cycle 4 in 4 patients (complete response in 2,
partial response in 2). Of the 6 patients with DLBCL in
Group 3, 3 achieved response (complete response in 1,
partial response in 2). Among the 18 patients with follicular lymphoma, response was seen after 4 cycles of
therapy in 7 patients (complete response in 2, partial
response in 5). Of the 16 patients with HL, response
was seen in 9 patients (complete response in 7, partial
response in 2): all patients achieving a complete
response with this diagnosis were in Group 1. There
was no significant difference in response rates in each
risk group between histologic subtypes (P 5 1.0, 0.84,
and 0.07 for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, by Fisher
exact test).
Toxicities associated with VGF and FGIV are
shown in Table 3. The VGF regimen was well tolerated, with few unplanned hospital admissions and
with grade 3 of 4 hematologic toxicities occurring in
fewer than one-third of patients. The addition of
ifosfamide to the VGF regimen (FGIV) increased both
hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities. In parti-

between patients with and without ASCT was not significant (overall survival
at 24 months for ASCT 69.2% [37.3-87.2] vs 41.7% [15.3-66.5], P 5 .255),

cular, grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
was seen in 46% and 36% of patients, respectively.
For both regimens, treatment delays and requirements for dose reduction were uncommon.
Median progression-free survival was 21 months
(range, 2-52), 5 months (range, 1-47), and 4 months
(range, 1-38) and overall survival 28 months (range,
3-52), 9 months (range, 1-47), and 30 months (range,
4-48) for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Estimated 4year overall survival was 49%, 28%, and 31% for
Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Overall 4-year survival for each lymphoma subtype is depicted in Figure
2. Patients with HL had a significantly superior 4-year
overall survival (68.8% [40.5-85.6]) when compared
with patients with DLBCL (26.4 [13.7-41.1]), P <.05.
An improved response was seen in 9 of
22 patients for whom treatment was escalated, but
improvements in overall survival for those responding compared with those who did not respond did
not reach statistical significance (overall survival
escalation response 50.0%, 95% confidence interval,
18.4-75.3 vs overall survival no escalation response
36.6%, 95% confidence interval, 12.5-62.0, P 5 .306).
Patients with HL were more likely to achieve a final
response (either complete or partial) if they had negative functional imaging at interim evaluation than if
imaging remained positive, even if computed tomographic imaging otherwise indicated satisfactory
response (87.5% vs 0%, P < .03, by Fisher exact test).
A total of 30 patients from Groups 1 and 2
underwent autologous stem cell transplantation either during the course of treatment or subsequently.

Patients who underwent ASCT had improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared
with those who did not (progression-free survival at
24 months for ASCT 40.0% [95% confidence interval,
22.8-56.7] vs 18.3% [8.2-31.7] for non-ASCT, P <
0.005; overall survival at 24 months for ASCT 73.3%
[53.7-85.7] vs 24.4 [13.2-37.6] for non-ASCT, P <
.0001). The improved survival associated with ASCT
was most striking among Group 2 patients (overall
survival at 24 months for ASCT 76.5% [48.8-90.5] vs
18.2% [7.4-32.8] for non-ASCT, P < .0001). Among
Group 1 patients, the difference in overall survival
between those with ASCT and those without ASCT
was not significant (overall survival at 24 months for
ASCT 69.2% [37.3-87.2] vs 41.7% [15.3-66.5], P 5
.255), although the number of patients in this group
was smaller (Fig. 3).
There was a trend toward improved overall survival at 24 months for patients with DLBCL receiving
ASCT in Group 1 (44.4% [13.6-71.9] for those without
ASCT compared with 75%[12.8-96.1]) for those with
ASCT and in Group 2 (20% [6.2-39.3] for those
patients without ASCT, compared with 66.7% [5.494.5] for those with ASCT), although significance was
not achieved, most likely because of small sample
sizes. There was a clear benefit in overall 24-month
survival by transplanting patients with FL in Group 2
(22.2% [3.4-51.3] for patients without ASCT compared
with 83.3% [27.3-97.5] in patients with ASCT, P <.04).

DISCUSSION
Our results confirm that outpatient administration of
vinorelbine-based and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is feasible and efficacious for the salvage ther-

VGF/FGIV Salvage for Lymphoma/Pasricha et al

apy of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and can be administered in a multicenter context. Our outcomes with VGF and FGIV
appear to be comparable to other established salvage
regimens requiring inpatient management, although
variations in patient populations and study design
clearly limit the validity of any direct comparison.10,22
The application of interim treatment escalation
during therapy in a salvage setting was a unique aspect of our study. Published data show that patients
with residual positron emission tomography positivity
after 2 to 3 cycles of primary therapy have a poorer
outcome compared with those with negative imaging.27,28 We purposefully set a ‘‘low’’ threshold for
escalation, incorporating functional imaging into the
assessment. Our results indicate that escalation
improves responses in some patients who were
‘‘failing’’ therapy. However, the lack of improvement
in survival among escalated patients achieving an
improved response compared with those who do not
achieve an improved response warrants further investigation; these patients must have a more refractory
illness with a poorer outcome. The significant adverse
impact with respect to final overall response rate of
positive functional imaging at the interim evaluation
within the HL group also implies that these refractory
patients have a more high-risk disease.
That differences between outcomes for patients
in Group 1 who did or did not proceed to ASCT
failed to achieve statistical significance raises the
possibility that patients who have had durable first
remissions may achieve further durable responses
with salvage therapeutic approaches without the
necessity for ASCT. This may be particularly relevant
for patients with CD201 disease, where VGF and
FGIV would present a relatively low-toxicity platform
for the incorporation of immunotherapeutic agents
(such as anti-CD20 antibody).
We conclude that VGF and FGIV are effective
and well-tolerated salvage approaches that can be
delivered in an ambulatory care setting. The exploratory analysis of interim disease evaluation suggests
that disease outcomes may be improved with escalation of therapy in selected patients and justifies further study. Finally, both VGF and FGIV represent
attractive targets for combination with available
immunotherapeutics.
