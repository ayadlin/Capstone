Abstract
The use of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI), a promising new class of antineoplastic agents, in combination with
cytotoxic agents, such as ionizing radiation and anticancer
drugs, has been attracting attention. In this study, we found
that sodium butyrate (SB), a widely studied HDACI, remarkably enhanced the cell killing effect of psoralen plus UVA
(PUVA) in several cancer cell lines, including skin melanoma.
Although a single treatment with PUVA or SB did not greatly
affect cell survival, combined treatment with SB and PUVA
induced marked apoptosis within 24 hours. The SB-induced
augmentation of the cell killing effect was more dramatic in
combination with PUVA than with anticancer drugs. The
number of double-strand breaks that formed during the repair
of PUVA-induced interstrand cross-links (ICL) in chromosomal DNA was significantly reduced in SB-pretreated cells,
suggesting that the ability to repair ICL was attenuated by
SB. In addition, the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine and
the formation of repair foci of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen after PUVA treatment, associated with nucleotide
excision repair (NER) in the removal of ICL, were not observed
in SB-pretreated cells. Furthermore, the repair kinetics of UVinduced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (well-known photolesions repaired by NER) were much slower in SB-pretreated
cells than in untreated cells. These results indicated that the
enhanced cell killing effect of PUVA by SB was attributable to
an attenuated ability to repair DNA and, especially, dysfunctional NER. [Cancer Res 2009;69(8):3492–500]

Introduction
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACI) have been
attracting attention as a promising new class of antineoplastic
agents for the treatment of solid and hematologic malignancies
(1–3). HDAC is an enzyme that regulates the acetylation status of
core nucleosomal histones by catalyzing the removal of acetyl
groups from their amino-terminal residue. Inhibition of HDAC
results in the accumulation of acetylated histones by histone
acetyltransferase. It weakens histone-DNA interactions and consequently increases the accessibility of transcription factors to DNA,
which causes the altered expression of several sets of proteins
involved in regulating cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis (4).
For instance, proapoptotic (e.g., Bak, Bax, and Bim) and

antiapoptotic (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, XIAP, and Mcl-1) factors are upregulated and down-regulated by HDACI and seem to play an
important role in their antitumor activity (5).
Recently, the use of HDACI in combination with cytotoxic agents
to treat cancer has been a focus of attention (6, 7). Enhancement of
the cell killing effects of radiation and anticancer drugs by various
HDACI [sodium butyrate (SB), trichostatin A (TSA), suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid, valproic acid, etc.], due to a marked induction
of apoptosis, has been reported (6–13). However, the degree of
enhancement is highly dependent on the combination of HDACI
and cytotoxic agent and on cell type. In addition, the molecular
mechanisms, by which HDACI improves the cell killing effect of
cytotoxic agents, are not fully understood. At present, efforts are
under way to determine which combinations of HDACI and
cytotoxic agents are most suitable for cancer therapy and elucidate
the mechanisms underlying the enhanced cell killing effect.
Psoralens are tricyclic aromatic compounds with phototherapeutic activities. Due to their planar structure, psoralens can
intercalate into DNA at alternating pyrimidine-purine sites, in
particular, at TA sites (14). After UVA (320–400 nm) irradiation, the
intercalated complex becomes activated, resulting in the formation
of covalent interstrand cross-links (ICL) with pyrimidines (15). At
present, psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) is used for the treatment of
several hyperproliferative skin diseases, such as psoriasis and
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL; ref. 16). PUVA-induced ICL in
chromosomal DNA induces an antiproliferative effect convenient
for skin therapy. Some studies found that PUVA showed a cell
killing effect (apoptosis) in cultured lymphoma cell lines (17, 18);
however, the application of PUVA to melanoma and carcinoma has
not been realized because the cell killing power is not as strong as
that of anticancer drugs and radiation.
In this study, we found that SB markedly enhanced the apoptotic
cell killing effect of PUVA. The degree to which the cytotoxicity
was enhanced by SB pretreatment was much greater for PUVA
treatment than for general anticancer drugs. Furthermore, we
clarified that SB attenuated DNA repair, especially nucleotide
excision repair (NER), which potentially contributed to the
augmented cell killing effect of PUVA.

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture conditions. The cell lines SK-MEL-28 and G-361,
derived from malignant human skin melanoma, were purchased from
Health Science Research Resources Bank. The cell line of a squamous cell
carcinoma of human skin (HSC-1) was purchased from Japanese Collection
of Research Bioresources. The cells were maintained in MEM ( for SK-MEL28 and G-361) or DMEM ( for HSC-1) supplemented with fetal bovine serum
[FBS; 10% (SK-MEL28 and G-361) or 20% (HSC-1)] and 100 units/mL of
penicillin/streptomycin at 37jC in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Combined treatment with SB and PUVA. The cells treated with SB
(0.1–3 mmol/L) for specific periods (4–24 h) were subjected to PUVA

treatment. The cells were cultured with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP; 10 7–
10 5 mol/L) for 1 h in a medium containing SB and irradiated with several
doses of UVA (1–5 J/cm2) immediately after changing to a SB-free medium.
The emission characteristics of the UVA lamp were described previously
(19). The irradiance at the sample level was about 1.5 mW/cm2. It takes
about 1 h for the irradiation of 5 J/cm2 UVA. The combined treatment
with SB and PUVA described above is henceforth called ‘‘SB-PUVA.’’ During
UVA irradiation, control cells and cells treated with SB only (these cells
were blocked out from UVA with an aluminum foil) were kept in the same
conditions as SB-PUVA–treated cells.
Viability assay. Cell viability was estimated from the metabolism of
fluorescein diacetate (FDA; Wako). FDA is hydrolyzed by cytoplasmic
esterases into fluorescent fluorescein in living cells. Cells were suspended in
PBS containing FDA (0.1 mg/mL) and incubated for 15 min at 37jC.
Propidium iodide (PI; 10 Ag/mL) was added before the measurement of

fluorescence intensity using a flow cytometer (FCM; Epics XL; Coulter).
Double staining with FDA and PI divided the cells into three populations:
(a) viable cells (FDA+, PI ), (b) dead cells (FDA , PI+), and (c) cells
undergoing apoptosis (FDA , PI ). The assessment of apoptosis by double
staining with FDA and PI is equivalent to that of using Annexin V staining, a
highly specific indicator of apoptosis (20).
Apoptosis assay. Apoptosis was determined by staining with both the
DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 to detect morphologic changes
to chromatin and PI to determine the percentage of subdiploid apoptotic
nuclei (sub-G1 fraction) as described previously (19). Caspase-3 activity was
measured by a direct assay in cell lysates using a fluorescent substrate of the
enzyme (Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-MCA; ref. 19).
Detection of DNA double-strand breaks. Double-strand breaks (DSB)
were detected using a biased sinusoidal field gel electrophoresis (BSFGE)
system (ATTO) as described previously (21). Cells were suspended in 1%

agarose plugs were treated with 0.5 mg/mL of proteinase K and 1 mg/mL
of RNase A and electrophoresed in a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was stained
with ethidium bromide and photographed.
DNA repair synthesis assay. SK-MEL-28 cells grown to confluence on
60-mm dishes or 35-mm glass base dishes were further cultured for 24 h in
serum-depleted MEM. They were treated with SB (3 mmol/L) for 24 h in
MEM containing 0.5% FBS. Subsequently, PUVA treatment was carried out
and the cells were incubated with bromodeoxyuridin (BrdUrd; 10 Amol/L)
for predetermined periods (0–30, 30–60, 60–90, and 90–120 min after PUVA
treatment).
For the FCM analysis, cells fixed in by ethanol (70%) were treated with
2 N HCl for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking with 1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA), they were incubated with primary antibody against
BrdUrd (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200) and then with secondary
antibody conjugated with FITC (Jackson Immuno Research; 1:200). The

(20 Ag/mL). Images were acquired on a laser scanning confocal microscope
(LSM510, Carl Zeiss).
Measurement of repair kinetics of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.
For in situ detection of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), SK-MEL-28
cells cultured in 35-mm glass base dishes were treated with SB (3 mmol/L)
for 24 h and irradiated with UVC (0.02 J/cm2; main emission wavelength,
254 nm; ATTO) through a polycarbonate isopore membrane filter (pore size,
3 Am; Millipore). After irradiation, they were incubated with SB-free MEM
for a predetermined period (0–24 h) to allow the repair of photolesions.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.5% Triton X-100
in PBS, and treated with 2 N HCl. After blocking with 1% BSA, they were
incubated with primary antibody against anti-CPD (1:1,500; Medical and
Biological Laboratories) and then with secondary antibody conjugated with
FITC. The nucleus was stained with PI (20 Ag/mL). Images were acquired on
a laser scanning confocal microscope.
For the detection of CPD by ELISA, cells were treated with SB (3 mmol/L)
for 24 h and irradiated with UVC (0.002 J/cm2). After incubation for
24 h with SB-free MEM, genomic DNA was extracted and denatured by

boiling for 15 min. The DNA (1 Ag/well) was applied into a polyvinylchloride
96-well plate precoated with protamine sulfate (0.003%). After blocking with
FBS (2% in PBS), the samples were incubated with the primary antibody
against anti-CPD (1:2,000) and then with the biotin-F(ab’)2 fragment of
antimouse IgG (Zymed; 1:2,000). Subsequently, a peroxidase reaction was
performed using o-phenylene diamine (0.4 mg/mL) in the presence of 0.02%
H2O2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of H2SO4 (2 mol/L), and
absorbance at 492 nm was measured by spectrophotometer.

Results
SB enhances cell killing effect of PUVA. SK-MEL-28 cells were
treated with SB (0.1–3 mmol/L) for a predetermined time (4–24 h;
the acetylated status of histone H3 is shown in Supplementary Fig.
S1) and subjected to PUVA treatment (Fig. 1). The cells were quite
resistant to PUVA treatment (8-MOP, 10 5 mol/L; UVA, 5 J/cm2). In
clinical treatment, a variety of 8-MOP concentrations have been
used. For example, tissue concentrations of 8-MOP after topical

administration [8-MOP bath therapy at 3 mg/L (1.4  10 5 mol/L)]
were reported to reach 4.5  10 6 mol/L (22). SB-PUVA treatment
induced drastic cell death, the extent of which was dependent on
SB dose, SB treatment time, 8-MOP dose, and UVA dose (Fig. 1A). A
time course study showed that survival decreased sharply from 8 to
24 hours (Fig. 1B). No synergistic effects were observed when the
cells were treated in the reverse order (PUVA first, followed by SB;
data not shown). TSA, another HDACI, also enhanced the cell
killing effect of PUVA (Fig. 1C). SB-PUVA treatment could
effectively kill other skin cancer cell lines: malignant human skin
melanoma (G-361) and human skin squamous cell carcinoma
(HSC-1; Fig. 1D).
Human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) and human lung
adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) also showed similar
susceptibility to SB-PUVA treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Furthermore, pretreatment with SB significantly augmented the
cytotoxicity induced by 5-MOP, a positional isomer of 8-MOP, plus
UVA (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Combined treatment with SB and PUVA induces apoptosis.

and PI (Fig. 2A), detection of a sub-G1 fraction (Fig. 2B),
morphologic change of chromatin (Fig. 2C), and caspase-3 activity
(Fig. 2D). After the treatment with SB-PUVA, the population of
the cells in the FDA(+)PI( ) section time-dependently moved to
FDA( )PI(+) via FDA( )PI( ) (Fig. 2A). A time-dependent
increase in the sub-G1 fraction was also observed (Fig. 2B).
Chromatin-condensed cells increased in number time-dependently
after the SB-PUVA treatment but not after single treatment with
PUVA or SB-UVA treatment (data not shown). Activation of
caspase-3 was observed in the period from 8 to 16 hours after the
treatment (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, z-vad-fmk, a pan-caspase
inhibitor, clearly attenuated cell death induced by SB-PUVA
treatment (data not shown). These results indicated that SB-PUVA
treatment effectively induced typical caspase-dependent apoptosis
in SK-MEL-28 cells.
Enhanced cell killing effect by SB is more drastic in
combination with PUVA than with anticancer drugs. SK-MEL28 cells precultured with SB for 24 hours were treated with various

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (8). April 15, 2009

anticancer drugs (bleomycin, etoposide, Adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil,
paclitaxel, and vincristine) for 24 hours (Fig. 3). The dose ranges of
the anticancer drugs used here were based on other papers (11–13,
23) and are comparable with or higher than the maximally
achieved therapeutic concentrations in humans (24). In all cases,
combined treatment with SB and anticancer drugs resulted in
augmented cytotoxicity compared with single treatments with
anticancer drugs. The cell killing effects of combined treatment
with SB and anticancer drugs were much weaker than those of SB
and PUVA treatment. Similar results were also observed in G-361
and HSC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
As treatment with HDACI, including SB, is reported to change
the representation of cellular apoptosis-related proteins (5), some
antiapoptotic proteins, such as c-IAP and Bcl-2, were analyzed and
found to be down-regulated by SB (Supplementary Fig. S5);
however, down-regulation might not be the main reason for the
significant cell death induced by SB-PUVA treatment because cell
killing was specific to PUVA treatment and not to the anticancer
drugs (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition, the change in
cell cycle distribution after treatment with SB was independent of
the cell killing effect (Supplementary Fig. S6). SB caused cells to
accumulate in the G2-M phase, and nocodazole, an antimicrotublue
drug, also arrested cells in G2-M; however, the drastic cell death
induced by PUVA treatment was observed in SB-pretreated cells,
not in nocodazole-pretreated cells. Munshi and colleagues showed
that cell cycle distribution was not involved in radiosensitive
effects of SB (9). Given these results, the mechanism of augmented
cytotoxicity by SB-PUVA treatment might not be merely changes
in the levels of cellular apoptosis-related proteins and cell cycle
distribution.
SB reduces the number of DSBs formed by PUVA treatment.
The DNA damage induced by PUVA treatment is mainly psoralen
ICL, which is believed to be the primary cause of the PUVA-induced
cell killing effect. We speculated that SB attenuated the repair
efficiency of psoralen ICL, which led to a significant cell death.
DSBs have been reported to be generated as intermediates in the
cellular repair of psoralen ICL (25). The degree to which DSBs
formed after treatment with PUVA or SB-PUVA was examined
using BSFGE as an index of the efficiency of the repair of ICL
(Fig. 4). Immediately after the PUVA treatment, clear DSBs were
observed. Pretreatment with SB reduced the number of DSBs
generated, the extent of which was dependent on SB-pretreated
dose (Fig. 4A) and time (Fig. 4B). Pretreatment with TSA also
reduced the generation of DSBs after the treatment with PUVA in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). In Fig. 4D, cells were pretreated
with SB for 24 hours, further cultured in SB-free medium for a
predetermined time, and then subjected to PUVA. According to the
amount of time cultured with SB-free medium, the formation of
DSBs attenuated by SB returned to the original level induced by
PUVA. These results suggested that SB reduced the repair of ICL
induced by PUVA.
SB attenuates DNA repair synthesis after PUVA treatment. It
has been proposed that the NER pathway is involved in the removal
of posralen ICL (25). The capacity for NER in SB-treated cells after
PUVA treatment was measured by DNA repair synthesis (DRS)
assay. The intensity of fluorescence from incorporated BrdUrd was
significantly higher in the PUVA-treated cells than untreated cells
(Fig. 5A, left) during all periods examined (0–2 h; the degree of
increase in fluorescence intensity was not so different among the
BrdUrd-labeled periods). On the other hand, no increase in
fluorescence after PUVA treatment was observed when the cells

were pretreated with SB (Fig. 5A, right). In addition, we could
detect discrete foci of BrdUrd in the nucleus due to DRS after
PUVA treatment (Fig. 5B), consistent with an earlier study (26).
However, such foci were hardly detectable after PUVA treatment in
cells pretreated with SB. Furthermore, repair foci of PCNA in the
late stages of NER (27–29) were detected after PUVA treatment but
not in cells pretreated with SB. These results suggested that SB
reduced the capacity for NER.
SB attenuates repair kinetics of CPD formed by UVC
irradiation. To further confirm that SB impaired NER, we
investigated the kinetics of the repair of CPD formed by exposure
to local UVC (Fig. 6). Immediately after irradiation (0 hour), clear
CPD foci having high fluorescent intensities were detected in both
SB-pretreated and untreated cells (Fig. 6A). Without pretreatment
with SB, the fluorescence weakened and the outline of CPD foci
became fuzzy 24 hours after the treatment. On the other hand,
distinct CPD foci were still detected in SB-pretreated cells. Cells
having CPD foci showing both a clear contour and high fluorescent
intensity were counted as CPD-positive (Fig. 6B). CPD-positive cells
decreased with repair time more rapidly in the SB-untreated cells
than SB-pretreated cells. At 24 hours after UV irradiation, about
15% of the untreated cells and 60% of the SB-pretreated cells were
CPD positive. In Fig. 6C, the levels of CPD 24 hours after UV
irradiation were determined using ELISA. Levels were significantly
higher for SB-pretreated cells than untreated cells. In addition,

cytotoxicity was much enhanced when SB-pretreated cells were
exposed to UVC (Supplementary Fig. S7). These results further
supported our hypothesis that SB attenuates NER capacity.

Discussion
We reported here, for the first time, that pretreatment with
HDACI (SB and TSA) remarkably enhanced the cell killing effect of
PUVA in several cancer cell lines. Recently, the use of HDACI, in
combination with various inducers of cell death, such as ionizing
radiation and anticancer drugs, has attracted considerable attention
(6–13). Among these combinations, we believe the HDACI-PUVA
treatment presented in this study to be one of the most effective.
A possible mechanism by which SB may enhance the cell killing
effect of PUVA was the augmentation of DNA damage. The number
of initial ICL induced by PUVA treatment might not be so different
between SB-pretreated and untreated cells because the initial
amount of CPD after UVC exposure was almost the same
regardless of SB pretreatment (Fig. 6). Kim and colleagues also
showed that pretreatment with TSA did not increase the overall
number of DNA-protein cross-links induced by camptothecin and
etoposide (11). On the other hand, the formation of DSBs as
intermediates in the repair of ICL was clearly attenuated by
pretreatment with SB (Fig. 4). Therefore, SB is suspected to cause
the accumulation of ICL by inhibiting their repair.

(8-MOP 10 5 mol/L, UVA 5 J/cm2 or 8-MOP 10 4 mol/L, UVA 1 J/cm2) treatment. Subsequently, they were incubated with BrdUrd (10 Amol/L) for the indicated
periods (a, 0–30 min; b, 30–60 min; c, 60–90 min; d, 90–120 min) after PUVA treatment. The fluorescence intensity due to the incorporated BrdUrd was measured
using FCM. As typical profiles of ‘‘untreated’’ and ‘‘treated with SB only,’’ a pattern of the cells labeled with BrdUrd during 30 to 60 min is shown. B, cells pretreated with
SB (3 mmol/L) for 24 h in MEM containing 0.5% FBS were subjected to PUVA (8-MOP, 10 5 mol/L; UVA, 5 J/cm2) treatment. After culture for 1 h (labeling period
with BrdUrd was from 30–60 min after irradiation), the cells were fixed. The incorporation of BrdUrd and repair foci of PCNA were visualized by immunofluorescence
microscopy. Cells that showed discrete foci of BrdUrd and PCNA in the nucleus were counted.

Methods. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01;
***, P < 0.001.

The mechanism by which ICL are repaired in mammals is not
well understood; however, it seems to involve several DNA repair
systems, such as NER, homologous recombination (HR) repair,
translesion synthesis (TLS), and the Fanconi anemia/BRCA (FA/
BRCA) pathway (25, 30, 31). In our understanding based on a
recently proposed mechanism for the repair of psoralen-ICL, NER
is important for the early stages of the repair process: (a)
recognition of ICL is probably carried out by NER proteins, such
as XPE (also called DDB2 or p48), XPC-Rad23, and XPA-RPA (28, 32,
33) and (b) dual incision at both sides of the lesion is mediated by
the NER excinuclease ERCC1/XPF, leading to an uncoupling of one
arm of the ICL (34). Thereafter, TLS, FA/BRCA, and HR pathways
would function sequentially. After the first incision (b), the
resulting gap of nucleotides is filled by DNA polymerase. PCNA is
essential for the repair synthesis (gap filling) stage of NER and
forms chromatin-bound foci (repair foci; refs. 27–29). Detection of
DRS by immunostaining of BrdUrd and PCNA is often used to
measure NER activity (28, 29, 35, 36). In this study, limited DRS was
observed in SB-pretreated cells after PUVA treatment (Fig. 5). In
addition, slower repair kinetics of CPD (Fig. 6) and much enhanced
cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. S7) after UVC irradiation in SBpretreated cells suggested that NER in the removal of ICL was
attenuated by SB. Furthermore, the degree of UVC-induced and
PUVA-induced cell death augmented by SB pretreatment was more
remarkable in cell lines expressing XPA, an essential protein for
NER, than in isogenic lines deficient in XPA (Supplementary
Fig. S8), supporting our contention that SB attenuated DNA repair,
especially the NER pathway. On the other hand, our findings are
inconsistent with earlier findings that pretreatment with SB
enhanced the capacity for NER (37, 38). If SB-pretreated cells have

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (8). April 15, 2009

an enhanced NER capacity, the rate of their survival after UV
irradiation would be high compared with that of untreated cells.
However, we and others have shown that pretreatment with HDACI
enhanced cell death induced by UVC (Supplementary Fig. S7; refs.
39, 40). A recent report by Kim and colleagues showed that levels of
CPD remaining at 4 hours after UVC irradiation were more than
twice higher in TSA-pretreated cells than in untreated cells, with
significant cell death in TSA-pretreated cells (39). Further study is
needed to explain this contradiction.
It is important to realize that the attenuation of NER capacity by
SB was reversible. In fact, the SB-attenuated generation of DSBs
during the repair of ICL was reversed with time in the SB-free
medium after treatment with SB (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the
capacity for NER recovered. This result reflected cell survival, that
is, SK-MEL-28 cells gradually became resistant to PUVA treatment
with time in the SB-free medium (Supplementary Fig. S9A).
Acetylated levels of histone H3 were well correlated with the
survival rate (Supplementary Fig. S9B). To achieve effective
treatment, acetylation levels of histone would be a good indicator
of when PUVA should be conducted.
Munshi and colleagues reported that the enhancement of
radiosensitivity by HDACI, including SB, was due to a downregulation in the expression of DSB repair proteins, especially
nonhomologous end rejoining-related (NHEJ) proteins, such as Ku70,
Ku80, DNA-PKcs, and Rad50 (9, 10). Furthermore, HDACI induced the
suppression of BRCA1 and Rad51, suggesting the attenuation of DSB
repair by HR (41, 42). In our study, the levels of several NHEJ-related
(Ku70 and Ku80) and NER-related (XPA and PCNA) proteins were
not significantly affected by the treatment with SB (Supplementary
Fig. S10). However, importantly, down-regulation of p53 expression

by SB was observed. Peltonen and colleagues also showed the
suppression of p53 by TSA in several melanoma cell lines, including
SK-MEL-28 cells (43). p53 recruits NER factors (XPC, XPD, XPB, and
XPE) to CPD sites (44–46). Furthermore, expression of XPC and XPE
is regulated by p53 (46). These reports suggested that loss or
disruption of p53 function may result in a significant decrease of
NER capacity.
Although our final goal is to apply SB-PUVA treatment to therapy
for some types of cancer, including melanoma and carcinoma, the
immediate potential applications of SB-PUVA treatment would be
in therapy for CTCL because PUVA and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (vorinostat), a HDACI, are used separately for CTCL
therapy. Indeed, SB-PUVA treatment killed the CTCL cells (HUT78
and HH) and was more effective than single PUVA treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S11). The enhanced cell killing effect was
greater than that of SB in combination with general anticancer
drugs.
We should consider the risk-benefit of SB-PUVA treatment, that
is, tumor-killing activity and cancer risk are two sides of the same
coin. PUVA therapy itself is associated with an increased incidence
of skin cancer (47). Because SB could attenuate the repair of ICL,

there is a possibility that SB increases the incidence of cancer
caused by PUVA treatment. How to handle HDACI in combination
with PUVA for clinical use needs to be studied further.
In summary, we found that combined treatment with HDACI (SB
and TSA) and PUVA had a significant cell killing effect on several
cancer cell lines. The cell killing effect of SB-PUVA treatment was
much greater than that of SB in combination with general
anticancer drugs. This enhanced cell killing was potentially caused
by the observed attenuation of DNA repair by SB, especially NER.
