Abstract
Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from a plant
used traditionally in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, has
been reported to exhibit chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory activities through unknown mechanism. Because of
the critical role of the transcription factor nuclear factor-KB
(NF-KB) in these processes, we investigated the effect of
berberine on this pathway. We found that berberine suppressed NF-KB activation induced by various inflammatory
agents and carcinogens. This alkaloid also suppressed
constitutive NF-KB activation found in certain tumor cells.
Suppression of NF-KB activation occurred through the
inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of IKBA by
the inhibition of IKB kinase (IKK) activation, leading to
suppression of phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
p65, and finally to inhibition of NF-KB reporter activity.
Inhibition of IKK by berbeine was direct and could be
reversed by reducing agents. Site-specific mutagenesis suggested the involvement of cysteine residue 179 in IKK.
Berberine also suppressed the expression of NF-KB–regulated
gene products involved in antiapoptosis (Bcl-xL, Survivin,
IAP1, IAP2, and cFLIP), proliferation (cyclin D1), inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2), and invasion (matrix metalloproteinase-9). Suppression of antiapoptotic gene products
correlated with enhancement of apoptosis induced by tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-A and chemotherapeutic agents and
with inhibition of TNF-induced cellular invasion. Overall, our
results indicate that chemopreventive, apoptotic, and antiinflammatory activities displayed by berberine may be
mediated in part through the suppression of the NF-KB
activation pathway. This may provide the molecular basis for
the ability of berberine to act as an anticancer and antiinflammatory agent. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5370–9]

active principles nor their molecular targets are well-defined.
For instance, extracts of golden seal (Hydrastis canadensis), oregon
grape (Berberis aquifolium), barberry (Berberis vulgaris), coptis or
golden thread (Coptis chinensis), tumeric tree (Berberis arisata),
Huangbai (Cortex phellodendri ), and Huanglian Letasiova S
(Rhizoma coptidis) have been traditionally used for bacterial diarrhea,
intestinal parasite infections, and ocular trachoma infections (1). In
Chinese pharmacopoeia, Huangbai and Huanglian are described as
‘‘heat removing’’ agents for their fever-reducing therapeutic applications. Almost four decades ago, berberine, an isoquinoline
alkaloid, was identified as an active component in all these plants.
Berberine has been shown to suppress the growth of a wide
variety of tumor cells including leukemia (2), melanoma (3), epidermoid carcinoma (4), hepatoma (5), oral carcinoma (6), glioblastoma (7), prostate carcinoma (8), and gastric carcinoma (9).
Animal studies have shown that berberine can suppress chemicalinduced carcinogenesis (10), tumor promotion (11), and tumor
invasion (12). It is a radiosensitzer of tumor cells but not of normal
cells (13). How berberine mediates these effects is not fully
understood, but its ability to modulate Mcl-1 (6), Bcl-xL (5),
cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (6), MDR (14), tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-a and IL-6 (15), iNOS (16), IL-12 (17), intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 and ELAM-1 expression (12), MCP-1 and CINC-1 (18),
cyclin D1 (19), activator protein (AP-1; ref. 20), HIF-1a (21), PPAR-g
(22), and topoisomerase II (23) has been shown. By using yeast
mutants, berberine was found to bind and inhibit stress-induced
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activation (17). Because
apoptotic, carcinogenic, and inflammatory effects and various
gene products (such as TNF-a, IL-6, COX-2, adhesion molecules,
cyclin D1, and MDR) modulated by berberine are regulated by
the transcription factor nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), we postulated
that this pathway plays a major role in the action of berberine.
NF-nB represents a group of five proteins, c-Rel, RelA (p65), RelB,
NF-nB1 (p50 and p105), and NF-nB2 (p52; ref. 24). In an inactive
state, NF-nB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as a heterotrimer
consisting of p50, p65, and InB subunits. On activation, InBa
undergoes phosphorylation and ubiquitination-dependent degradation leading to p65 nuclear translocation and binding to a
specific consensus sequence in the DNA, which results in gene
transcription. Most carcinogens, inflammatory agents, and tumor
promoters, including cigarette smoke, phorbol ester, okadaic acid
(OA), H2O2, and TNF-a, have been shown to activate NF-nB. NF-nB
has been shown to regulate the expression of several genes whose
products are involved in tumorigenesis. These include antiapoptotic genes (e.g., Bcl-xL, cIAP, survivin, and cFLIP), COX-2, matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), genes encoding adhesion molecules,
chemokines, and inflammatory cytokines and cell cycle regulatory
genes (e.g., cyclin D1 and c-myc; ref. 25).

Berberine Inhibits NF-kB Activation

Whether berberine exerts its apoptotic, chemopreventive, antiinflammatory, and anti-invasive effects through suppression of the
NF-nB pathway was investigated in detail. We found that berberine
inhibited the activation of NF-nB through the direct inhibition of
InBa kinase, and subsequently of InBa phosphorylation and
degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. The
suppression of NF-nB by this agent led to the down-regulation of
gene products that prevent apoptosis (Bcl-xL, survivin, IAP1, IAP2,
and cFLIP) and promote inflammation (COX-2), proliferation
(cyclin D1), and tumor metastasis (MMP-9).

nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with the relevant antibody, and detected
by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham).
IKK assay. To determine the effect of berberine on TNF-a–induced IKK
activation, an IKK assay was performed. Briefly, the IKK complex from
whole-cell extracts was precipitated with antibody against IKK-h and then
treated with protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce). After 2 h, the beads were
washed with whole-cell extract buffer and then resuspended in a kinase
assay mixture containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mmol/L MgCl2,
2 mmol/L DTT, 20 ACi [32P] ATP, 10 Amol/L unlabeled ATP, and 2 Ag of
substrate glutathione S-transferase-InBa [amino acid (aa) 1–54]. After

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Berberine, with chemical structure as shown in Fig. 1A, was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. A 50 mmol/L solution of berberine was
prepared in DMSO, stored as small aliquots at 20jC, and then diluted as
needed in cell culture medium. Bacteria-derived human recombinant
human TNF-a, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 
107 U/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech. Cigarette smoke condensate
(CSC) was kindly supplied by Dr. C. Gary Gairola (University of Kentucky,
Lexington, KY). Penicillin, streptomycin, RPMI 1640, and fetal bovine serum
were purchased from Invitrogen. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), OA, and
anti–h-actin antibody were obtained from Aldrich-Sigma. Antibodies
against p65, p50, InBa, cyclin D1, MMP-9, IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-xL, FLIP, poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)1, and COX-2 and
Annexin V staining kit were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Phospho-specific anti-InBa (Ser32/36) and phospho-specific anti-p65 (Ser536)
were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti–InB kinase (IKK)-a and anti–IKKh antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex. IKK plasmids, wild-type, and
that with mutated cysteine residue 179 (Cys179A) were kindly provided by
Dr. T.D. Gilmore from Boston University (Boston, MA).
Cell lines. The cell lines H1299 (lung adenocarcinoma), Jurkat (human
leukemia), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), and U266 (human multiple
myeloma) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Normal
human foreskin diploid fibroblast cells were supplied by Dr. Olivia Smith of
the University of Texas, San Antonio, Texas. The H1299, Jurkat, and U266
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, and the HEK293 cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. All culture medium were also
supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. To determine NF-nB activation,
we prepared nuclear extracts and performed electrophoretic mobility shift
assays (EMSA) as described previously (26). For supershift assays, nuclear
extracts prepared from TNF-a–treated cells were incubated with antibodies
against either p50 or p65 of NF-nB for 30 min at 37jC before the complex
was analyzed by EMSA. PIS was included as the negative control. The dried
gels were visualized, and the radioactive bands were quantitated with a
Storm 820 and Image quant software (Amersham).
AP-1 activation assay. To assay AP-1 activation by EMSA, 10 Ag of
nuclear extract protein were incubated with 16 fmol of the 32P-end–labeled
AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide 5¶-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3¶ (bold
indicates the AP-1 binding site) for 30 min at 37jC, and then the DNAprotein complexes formed were resolved from free oligonucleotide on 6%
native polyacrylamide gels. The radioactive bands were visualized and
quantified as indicated above.
Western blot analysis. To determine the effect of berberine on TNF-a–
dependent InBa phosphorylation, InBa degradation, p65 translocation, and
p65 phosphorylation, cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were prepared. For
detection of cleavage products of PARP, antiapoptotic and angiogenesis
markers whole-cell extracts were prepared by subjecting berberine-treated
cells to lysis in lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mmol/L NaCl,
2 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01 Ag/mL aprotinin,
0.005 Ag/mL leupeptin, 0.4 mol/L phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride, and
4 mmol/L NaVO4]. Lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove
insoluble material. Supernatant were collected and kept at 80jC. Either
cytosolic or nuclear extract or whole-cell lysates were resolved by SDSPAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electro-transferred to

incubation at 30jC for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with
SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDSPAGE, the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized with a
Storm 820. To determine the total amounts of IKK-a and IKK-h in each
sample, 30 Ag of whole-cell proteins was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE,
electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with
either anti–IKK-a or anti–IKK-h antibody.
JNK assay. To determine the effect of berberine on the kinase activity of
JNK, JNK complex from whole-cell extracts was precipitated with antibody
against JNK1, followed by treatment with protein A/G-agarose beads
(Pierce). After 2 h of incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer
and then assayed in kinase assay mixture containing 50 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.4), 20 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L DTT, 20 ACi of [32P] ATP, 10 Amol/L
unlabeled ATP, and 2 Ag of substrate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun
(aa 1–79). The immunocomplex was incubated at 30jC for 30 min and then
boiled with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on
10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized
using the PhosphorImager. To determine the total amount of JNK1 in each
sample, whole-cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using
anti-JNK1 antibody.
NF-KB–dependent reporter gene expression assay. NF-nB–dependent
reporter gene expression was performed. The effect of berberine on TNF-a,
TNF receptor (TNFR), TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD-), TNFRassociated factor 2 (TRAF2-), NF-nB–inducing kinase (NIK-), and IKKNF-nB–dependent reporter gene transcription was analyzed by the
secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay.

translocation of p65. Briefly, treated cells were plated on a poly-L-lysine–
coated glass slide by centrifugation (Cytospin 4; Thermoshendon), air dried,
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After being washed in PBS, the slides
were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with
rabbit polyclonal anti-human p65 at a 1/200 dilution. After overnight
incubation at 4jC, the slides were washed, incubated with goat anti-rabbit
IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) at a 1/200 dilution for 1 h, and
counterstained for nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (50 ng/mL) for 5 min. Stained
slides were mounted with mounting medium purchased from SigmaAldrich and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2; Nikon).
Pictures were captured using a Photometrics Coolsnap CF color camera
(Nikon) and MetaMorph version 4.6.5 software (Universal Imaging).
Live/dead assay. To measure apoptosis, we also used the Live/Dead
assay (Molecular Probes), which determines intracellular esterase activity
and plasma membrane integrity. Calcein-AM, a nonfluorescent polyanionic
dye, is retained by live cells, in which it produces intense green fluorescence
through enzymatic (esterase) conversion. In addition, the ethidium
homodimer enters cells with damaged membranes and binds to nucleic
acids, thereby producing a bright red fluorescence in dead cells. Briefly,
2  105 cells were incubated with 25 Amol/L berberine and treated with
1 nmol/L TNF-a for up to 24 h at 37jC. Cells were stained with the Live/
Dead reagent (5 Amol/L ethidium homodimer and 5 Amol/L calcein-AM)
and incubated at 37jC for 30 min. Cells were analyzed under a fluorescence
microscope (Labophot-2; Nikon).
Cytotoxicity assay. The effects of berberine on the cytotoxic effects of
TNF-a and other chemotherapeutic agents were determined by the 3-(4,5Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) uptake
method. Briefly, 5, 000 cells were incubated with berberine in triplicate in

a 96-well plate and then treated with the 1 nmol/L TNF-a, 0.1 Amol/L 5-5fluorouracil, and 0.1 Amol/L doxorubicin for 24 h at 37jC. An MTT solution
was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37jC. An extraction buffer
(20% SDS and 50% dimethylformamide) was added, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37jC. Then, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm
using a 96-well multiscanner (Dynex Technologies; MRX Revelation).
Annexin V assay. An early indicator of apoptosis is the rapid translocation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the cytoplasmic interface of membrane to the extracellular
surface. This loss of membrane asymmetry can be detected by using
the binding properties of Annexin V. To identify apoptosis, we used an
Annexin V antibody, which was conjugated with a FITC fluorescence dye.
Briefly, 1  106 cells were pretreated with berberine, treated with TNF-a
for 24 h at 37jC, and subjected to Annexin V staining. The cells were
washed in PBS, resuspended in 100 AL of binding buffer containing a FITCconjugated anti-Annexin V antibody, and then analyzed with a flow
cytometer (FACS Calibur).
Invasion assay. Because invasion is a crucial step in tumor metastasis, a
membrane invasion culture system was used to assess cell invasion. The BD
BioCoat tumor invasion system consists of chambers with a lightproof
polyethylene terephthalate membrane coated with a reconstituted basement membrane gel with 8-Am-diameter pores (BD Biosciences). We
suspended 2.5  104 non–small cell adenocarcinoma H1299 cells in serumfree medium and seeded the upper wells with them. After incubation
overnight, the cells were treated with 25 Amol/L berberine and stimulated
with 1 nmol/L TNF-a for 24 h in the presence of 1% FBS. The cells that
invaded the lower chamber by migrating through the Matrigel during
incubation were stained with 4 Ag/mL calcein-AM in PBS for 30 min at
37jC and scanned for fluorescence with a Victor 3 multiplate reader
(Perkin-Elmer); fluorescent cells were counted.
Statistical analysis. The statistical analysis was done using ANOVA test
and Student’s t test with Microsoft excel software.

Results
We investigated the effect of berberine on constitutively active
NF-nB and on that activated by various carcinogens and
inflammatory stimuli, on NF-nB–regulated gene expression, on
apoptosis induced by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents, and
on invasion. We focused on TNF-a–induced NF-nB activation
because the role of TNF-a role in the NF-nB activation pathway has
been relatively well-established.
Berberine inhibits NF-KB activation induced by carcinogens
and inflammatory stimuli. TNF-a, PMA, OA, and CSC are well
known potent activators of NF-nB but by different mechanisms
(26). We examined the effect of berberine on the activation of
NF-nB by these agents using DNA binding assays. TNF-a, PMA, OA,
and CSC induced NF-nB, and berberine suppressed this activation
in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that berberine acts at
a step in the NF-nB activation pathway that is common to all four
agents.
We then determined the dose and time of exposure to berberine
required to suppress TNF-a induced NF-nB activation in Jurkat
cells. EMSA showed that berberine alone had no effect on NF-nB
activation, but it inhibited TNF-a–mediated NF-nB activation in a
dose- (Fig. 1C) and time-dependent (Fig. 1D) manner, respectively,
and that 18 h exposure to 50 Amol/L berberine was sufficient to
suppress activation.
Most tumor cells have constitutively active NF-nB that arises
through mechanisms that vary with the cell type. Whether
berberine can inhibit constitutively active NF-nB in multiple
myeloma U266 cells was determined. Berberine at a concentration
40 Amol/L and higher completely suppressed constitutively active
NF-nB in U266 cells (Fig. 2A).

NF-nB is a protein complex in which various combinations of
Rel/NF-nB constitute active NF-nB heterodimers that bind to
specific DNA sequences. To show that the band visualized by EMSA
in TNF-a–treated cells was indeed NF-nB, nuclear extracts from
TNF-a–activated Jurkat cells were incubated with antibodies to
the p50 and the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-nB. The preincubation of
nuclear extracts with anti-p65 and mixture of anti-p65 and antip50 antibodies shifted the band to a higher molecular complex
(Fig. 2B), suggesting that the TNF-a–activated complex consisted
of p50 and p65. The band lower to NF-nB is a nonspecific band.
Preimmune serum (PIS) did not cause any super shift. Addition of
excess unlabeled oligonucleotide (competitor; 100-fold molar
excess) caused a complete disappearance of the band, whereas
mutated oligonucleotide had no effect on DNA binding.
Some NF-nB inhibitors, such as caffeic acid phenethyl ester and
plumbagin (27, 28), directly suppress binding of NF-nB to DNA. We
determined whether berberine mediates suppression of NF-nB
activation through a similar mechanism. Berberine did not modify
the DNA-binding ability of NF-nB proteins (Supplementary Fig. S1).
These results suggest that berberine inhibits NF-nB activation at a
step upstream to its DNA binding.
Whether berberine suppresses other transcription factor such as
AP-1 under the conditions it suppresses NF-nB was examined. AP-1
showed constitutive activation in Jurkat cells, and berberine had no
effect on it (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Berberine inhibits TNF-A–dependent IKBA degradation and
phosphorylation. The translocation of NF-nB to the nucleus is
preceded by the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolytic
degradation of InBa. To determine whether inhibition of TNF-a
induced NF-nB activation was due to inhibition of InBa degradation, we pretreated Jurkat cells with berberine and then exposed
them to TNF-a for various time periods. We then examined the cells
for NF-nB in the nucleus by EMSA and for InBa degradation in the
cytoplasm by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, TNF-a
activated NF-nB in the control cells. TNF-a induced NF-nB as early
as 30 minutes and that continued to increase at 60 minutes but had
no effect on berberine-pretreated cells. Moreover, TNF-a induced
InBa degradation as early as 10 minutes, but in berberine,
pretreated cells showed TNF-a had no effect on InBa degradation
(Fig. 2D). These results indicate that berberine inhibited both
TNF-a induced InBa degradation and NF-nB activation.
To determine whether the inhibition of TNF-a–induced InBa
degradation was due to an inhibition of InBa phosphorylation, we
used the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal
(ALLN) to block degradation of InBa. Western blot using an
antibody that recognizes the serine-phosphorylated (Ser32/36) form
of InBa showed that TNF-a induced InBa phosphorylation was
strongly suppressed by berberine (Fig. 3A).
Berberine directly inhibits TNF-A–induced IKBA kinase
activation. Because berberine inhibits the phosphorylation and
degradation of InBa, we tested the effect of berberine on TNF-a–
induced IKK activation, which is required for TNF-a–induced
phosphorylation of InBa. As shown in Fig. 3B, TNF-a induced the
activation of IKK and berberine completely suppressed it (top).
Neither TNF-a nor berberine had any effect on the expression of
IKK-a (middle) or IKK-h proteins (bottom).
To evaluate whether berberine suppresses IKK activity directly
by binding to IKK or indirectly by suppressing its activation, we
immunoprecipitated IKK complex from whole-cell extracts from
TNF-a–stimulated cells with anti–IKK-h antibody. The immunocomplexes were treated in vitro with various concentrations of

Jurkat cells were preincubated with 50 Amol/L berberine for 18 h and then
treated with 1 nmol/L TNF-a for the indicated times. Whole-cell extracts were
immunoprecipitated with antibody against IKK-h and analyzed by an immune
complex kinase assay. To examine the effect of berberine on the level of
expression of IKK proteins, whole-cell extracts were fractionated on SDS-PAGE
and examined by Western blot analysis using anti–IKK-a and anti–IKK-h
antibodies. C, effect of berberine on IKK activity (left). Whole-cell extracts were
prepared from Jurkat cells treated with 1 nmol/L TNF-a and immunoprecipitated

then assayed in kinase buffer without and with 100 Amol/L DTT along with
absence or presence of berberine (50 Amol/L). D, effect of berberine on
wild-type and C179A-mutated IKK. HEK293cells were transfected with

and the indicated concentration of berberine was added in vitro . Immune
complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. IB, immunoblot.

berberine, and kinase assay for IKK was performed. Results from
the immune complex kinase assay showed that berberine directly
inhibited the activity of IKK (Fig. 3C, left). This finding suggested
that berberine directly modulates TNF-a induced IKK activation.
IKK-h contains various cysteine residues. The modulation of IKK
activity by berberine through the modification of cysteine residues
was investigated using reducing agents, such as DTT. We found
that addition of DTT to the kinase reactions reversed the
berberine-mediated inhibition of IKK activity induced by TNF-a
(Fig. 3C, right).

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

IKK-h contains a cysteine at position 179 in its activation loop
that is critical for its biological activity. To determine whether this
cysteine is involved in berberine-mediated inhibition, we transfected cells with plasmids for either wild-type Flag-IKK-h or FlagIKK-h with a C179A mutation. Berberine inhibited constitutive
wild-type IKK-h activity (Fig. 3D). In contrast, berberine had no
effect on IKK-h (C179A) activity (Fig. 3D). These findings proved
that berberine inhibited IKK-h activity through the modification of
the Cys179 residue.
We also examined whether berberine affects other protein
kinases. The results show that TNF activates JNK, and berberine
slightly inhibited the TNF-a–induced activation of JNK at later
times (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Berberine inhibits TNF-A–induced phosphorylation and
nuclear translocation of p65. We also investigated the effect of
berberine on TNF-a–induced phosphorylation of p65 because
phosphorylation is also required for its transcriptional activity (24).
In the nuclear fraction from the TNF-a–treated cells, berberine
suppressed the phosphorylated form of p65 (Ser536; Fig. 4A, top).
We further showed that berberine suppressed TNF-a–induced
nuclear translocation of p65, as measured by Western blotting
(Fig. 4A, middle).
An immunocytochemistry assay confirmed that berberine
suppressed TNF-a–induced translocation of p65 to the nucleus
(Fig. 4B).
Berberine represses NF-KB–dependent reporter gene
expression. Because DNA binding alone does not always correlate
with NF-nB–dependent gene transcription, suggesting there are
additional regulatory steps (29). We transiently transfected the cells
with NF-nB–regulated SEAP reporter construct and pretreated with
berberine or left untreated and then stimulated the cells with
TNF-a. A 3-fold increase in SEAP activity was noted after
stimulation with TNF-a (Fig. 5A), and that was abolished by
dominant-negative InBa, indicating the specificity. When the cells
were pretreated with berberine, TNF-a–induced NF-nB–dependent
SEAP expression was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5A). These results indicate that berberine, inhibits NF-nB–
dependent reporter gene expression induced by TNF-a.
TNF-a–induced NF-nB activation is mediated through sequential interaction of the TNFR with TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and IKK-h,
resulting in phosphorylation of InBa, which leads to degradation of
InBa and p65 nuclear translocation (30). To delineate the site of
action of berberine in the TNF-a–signaling pathway leading to
NF-nB activation, cells were transiently transfected with TNFR1,
TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and IKK-h, and then NF-nB–dependent SEAP
expression was monitored with or without berberine treatment. As
shown in Fig. 5B, berberine suppressed TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2,
NIK, and IKK plasmid–induced reporter gene expression. Because
IKK activation can cause the phosphorylation of InBa and p65 (31),
we suggest that berberine inhibits NF-nB activation through
inhibition of IKK.
Berberine represses the expression of TNF-A–induced NFKB–dependent antiapoptotic, proliferation, and metastatic
gene products. Because NF-nB regulates the expression of the
antiapoptotic proteins IAP1/2, Bcl-xL, survivin, and cFLIP, we
investigated whether berberine could modulate TNF-a–induced
expression of these antiapoptotic genes. We found that berberine
abolished TNF-a–induced expression of Bcl-xL, survivin, IAP1/2,
and cFLIP antiapoptotic proteins (Fig. 5C, top).
We also investigated whether berberine can modulate NF-nB–
regulated gene products involved in the proliferation of tumor cells.

Berberine Inhibits NF-kB Activation

TNF-a has been shown to induce cyclin D1 and COX-2, both of
which have NF-nB binding sites in their promoters. Thus, we
investigated whether berberine inhibits the TNF-a–induced
expression of these proteins by Western blot analysis using specific
antibodies. We found that berberine abolished TNF-a–induced
expression of COX-2 and cyclin D1 (Fig. 5C, middle).
We also investigated whether berberine modulates TNF-a
induced NF-nB–dependent MMP-9 expression, a gene involved in
the invasion of tumor cells. It has been established already that
MMP-9 is regulated by NF-nB. We found that berberine abolished
TNF-a–induced expression of MMP-9 (Fig. 5C, bottom).
Berberine potentiates apoptosis induced by TNF-A and
chemotherapeutic agents. Because the activation of NF-nB has
been shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by TNF-a and
chemotherapeutic agents (32), we investigated whether berberine
affects TNF-a and chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis. The
esterase-staining method (also called Live/Dead assay) showed that
berberine up-regulated TNF-a–induced apoptosis from 5% to 65%
(Fig. 6A). MTT assay showed that berberine enhanced cytotoxicity
induced by TNF-a, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and doxorubicin (Fig. 6B).
Caspase-mediated PARP cleavage likewise showed that berberine
enhanced the apoptotic effect of TNF-a substantially (Fig. 6C, left).
Annexin V-FITC (Fig. 6C, middle) and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL; Fig. 6C,
right) staining also confirmed that berberine up-regulated TNF-a
induced early events in apoptosis. These results together indicate
that berberine potentiates the apoptotic effects of TNF-a and
chemotherapeutic agents.
Whether berberine has any effect on normal cells was examined
using normal human diploid fibroblasts. MTT assay showed that

under conditions as indicated above, berberine had no significant
effect on the viability of these cells (data not shown).
Berberine suppresses TNF-A–induced invasion activity. The
expression of both COX-2 and MMP-9 has been linked with tumor
cell invasion (33). Therefore, we investigated whether berberine
can modulate the tumor cell invasion activity induced by TNF-a
in vitro in a Matrigel invasion assay. We found that berberine
suppressed TNF-a–induced tumor cell invasion (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The goal of this study was to determine whether the chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, and apoptotic effects of berberine
were mediated through the modulation of the NF-nB–signaling
pathway and NF-nB–regulated gene products. We found that
berberine suppressed NF-nB activation induced by various
carcinogens and inflammatory agents. NF-nB inhibition was due
to inhibition of IKK activation, leading to suppression of InBa
phosphorylation, InBa degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and
NF-nB–dependent reporter gene expression. Berberine also downregulated gene products involved in cell proliferation, antiapoptosis, and invasion. This down-regulation led to the potentiation
of apoptosis and inhibition of invasion.
This is the first report to suggest that berberine can inhibit the
NF-nB activation induced by TNF-a, PMA, OA, and CSC. In support
of our results, this alkaloid has been shown to inhibit acetaldehydeinduced NF-nB activation in human hepatoma cells (34). Unlike
our results, however, Enk and colleagues (35) recently reported that
berberine has no effect on TNF-a–induced NF-nB activation in
human keratinocytes. The differences in cell types, methodology

used to measure NF-nB, and conditions used may account for the
difference in results.
How berberine suppresses NF-nB activation was investigated in
detail. We found that berberine suppresses the phosphorylation
and degradation of InBa, consistent with that reported earlier with
acetaldehyde-induced activation (34). We further found that this
alkaloid inhibits InBa degradation through inhibition of activation
of IKK induced by TNF-a. We found that berberine inhibits IKK
activity directly by modification of cysteine residue 179. This
residue is present in the activation loop of IKK-h and is a target for
a variety of compounds such as arsenic and auranofin (36).
Interactions of these compounds with IKK involving cysteine
residue 179 is easily reversed by addition of thiol-reducing agents
(e.g., DTT and reduced glutathione; ref. 37). The inhibitory effects of
N-ethylmaleimid on IKK activity were abolished by the expression
of mutant IKK-h, which contains alanine at residue 179 rather than
cysteine (38, 39). Like berberine, we showed recently that butein
also inhibits the NF-nB activation by direct modification of cysteine
residue 179 in IKK-h (26). Different cysteine residues have been
identified in IKK that interfere with kinase activity. For instance,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

herbimycin A binds specifically to cysteine residue 59 (40);
Withaferin A interacts with cysteine residues (41); and aspirin
interferes with ATP binding site (42). Thus, the mechanism by
which berberine and other agents inhibit IKK may involve cysteine
residue but not always the same cysteine residue.
The concentration of berberine used in our study is comparable
with several commercially available inhibitors of IKK. For example,
IKK inhibitor PS-1145 acts in a range of 10 to 50 Amol/L, which is
comparable with the dose of berberine used in our study (43).
Another compound, BMS-345541, was found to bind to an
allosteric site of IKK-h and acts as an ATP noncompetitive
inhibitor with IC50 of 0.3 Amol/L (44). Although these compounds
do not possess positively charged imine moiety as found in
berberine, they are alkaloid in nature similar to berberine.
TNF-a activates NF-nB through sequential recruitment of
TNFR1, TNFR2, NIK, and IKK, and berberine suppressed NF-nB
activation by all of these signaling intermediates. IKK has been
implicated in the phosphorylation of p65 (31), which is needed for
its transcriptional activity. We found that berberine suppressed the
phosphorylation of p65. Furthermore, berberine had no direct

effect on the binding of p50-p65 to the DNA. Therefore, it is
possible that inhibition of IKK-mediated InBa degradation and p65
phosphorylation contribute to the suppressive effects of berberine
on NF-nB activation.

We found that numerous gene products that are regulated by
NF-nB were down-regulated by berberine. These included proteins
with proinflammatory (COX-2), cell proliferative (cyclin D1),
antiapoptotic (Bcl-xL, survivin, IAP1, IAP2, and cFLIP), and invasive

1% serum and then assayed for invasion. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.

(MMP-9) activities. The down-regulation of COX-2 by berberine is
in agreement with previous report (20). The decrease in TNF-a and
iNOS (45); urokinase-plasminogen activator and plasminogen
activator inhibitor (12); Mcl-1 (6); MCP-1 and CINC-1 (18); and
mdr1 (14) expression reported previously could also be due to
down-regulation of NF-nB activation by berberine. Down-regulation of cyclin D1 reported here is also in agreement with previous
results (19). It is possible that suppression of proliferation of
various tumor cell lines by berberine is through down-regulation of
cyclin D1.
Our results also show that berberine potentiated the apoptotic
effects of TNF-a and chemotherapeutic agents. This is likely linked
to the down-regulation of antiapoptotic (Bcl-xL, survivin, IAP1,
IAP2, and cFLIP) gene products. The down-regulation of Bcl-xL is
in agreement with previous reports (5). It is possible that
sensitization of cells to chemotherapeutic agents by berberine is
mediated through the down-regulation of mdr1 as reported
previously (14). Consistent with our results, Lin and colleagues
(14) reported that berberine potentiated the anti-tumor effects of
paclitaxel on digestive tract cancer cells.
In animal studies, berberine has been shown to suppress
chemical-induced carcinogenesis (10), phorbol-ester–induced tumor promotion (11), and tumor invasion (12). Various carcinogens
and tumor promoters have been shown to activate NF-nB. Thus,
suppression of NF-nB by berberine as shown here may contribute
to its ability to suppress carcinogenesis. Tumor invasion requires

the expression of MMP-9, which was also suppressed by berberine.
Whether doses of berberine used in the current studies are
achievable in vivo is unclear. The doses used in vitro studies,
however, are irrelevant to that in vivo as the exposure to the drug
in vivo may occur over long-periods. Thus, overall, our results
suggest that anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and proapoptotic
effects of berberine may be mediated through inhibition of NF-nB
induced by carcinogens and inflammatory agents.
Limited clinical trials suggest that berberine is quite safe in
human (46). Further studies in animals and in patients are required
to recognize the full potential of this important constituent of
ancient medicine.
