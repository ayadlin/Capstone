Abstract
HIV protease inhibitors (HIV PI) are a class of antiretroviral
drugs that are designed to target the viral protease.
Unexpectedly, this class of drugs is also reported to have
antitumor activity. In this study, we have evaluated the in vitro
activity of nelfinavir, a HIV PI, against human melanoma cells.
Nelfinavir inhibits the growth of melanoma cell lines at low
micromolar concentrations that are clinically attainable.
Nelfinavir promotes apoptosis and arrests cell cycle at G1
phase. Cell cycle arrest is attributed to inhibition of cyclindependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and concomitant dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor. We further show
that nelfinavir inhibits CDK2 through proteasome-dependent
degradation of Cdc25A phosphatase. Our results suggest that
nelfinavir is a promising candidate chemotherapeutic agent
for advanced melanoma, for which novel and effective
therapies are urgently needed. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1221–7]

Introduction
Metastatic melanoma remains a serious clinical challenge.
Currently, there is no proven effective therapy to improve survival
of metastatic melanoma patients. Dacarbazine and related
compound, temozolomide, remain the standard chemotherapy.
However, for dacarbazine or temozolomide, the overall response
rate is only 15% to 20%, with median response duration of about
4 to 6 months. Various combinations of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and vaccine strategies have also failed to show survival
advantages compared with single-agent therapies (1). New
strategies are urgently needed to decrease morbidity and enhance
survival of melanoma patients.
HIV protease inhibitors (HIV PI) are a class of small-molecule
drugs that were rationally designed to target the viral aspartyl
protease. Currently, there are nine Food and Drug Administration–
approved HIV PIs, including commonly prescribed drugs ritonavir,
saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir. These drugs, given in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are the mainstays of
the current therapeutic regimens for HIV-infected patients. In
recent years, there have been increasing interests in evaluating HIV
PIs as antineoplastic agents. Early support for this concept came
from the observation that patients on highly active antiretroviral
therapy had a reduced risk of developing HIV-associated malig-

nancies, such as Kaposi’s sarcoma and non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Highly active antiretroviral therapy had also led to regression of
these tumors (2). Intuitively, such antitumor activity was attributed
to suppression of HIV infection and reconstitution of immune
functions. However, several recent studies support the notion that
HIV PIs have direct antitumor activities that are independent of
their antiviral activity. It was first reported that saquinavir,
indinavir, and ritonavir enhanced the antiproliferative and
differentiating activity of all-trans-retinoic acid for myelocytic
leukemia cells (3). Sgadari et al. (4) reported that indinavir and
saquinavir potently inhibited angiogenesis and induced regression
of Kaposi’s sarcoma–like lesions in nude mice. Subsequently,
several HIV PIs have been shown to inhibit cell growth and/or
induce apoptosis in various cancer cell types, including Kaposi’s
sarcoma (5), lymphoma, fibrosarcoma (6), multiple myeloma (7),
prostate cancer (8, 9), and breast cancer (10). Currently, there are
several prospective clinical trials under way in Italy that evaluate
HIV PIs on HIV-associated cancers (Kaposi’s sarcoma and non–
Hodgkin’s lymphoma) and non–HIV-associated cancers (Kaposi’s
sarcoma and non–small cell lung carcinoma; ref. 2). The results of
those trials have not been reported.
Despite mounting evidence that supports HIV PIs as promising
antineoplastic agents, enthusiasm for these drugs is limited by the
lack of understanding of their antitumor mechanisms. Previous
studies have pointed to multiple cellular signaling pathways as
being perturbed by HIV PIs, which include proteasome, nuclear
factor-nB, Akt, and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (6, 7, 10, 11). It is not clear what cellular molecules are
directly targeted by HIV PIs or how HIV PIs affect the abovementioned signaling pathways. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms underlying antitumor activity of HIV PIs will be
essential for further development of this class of agents.
In this study, we provide preclinical data for the use of HIV PI
nelfinavir as a chemotherapeutic agent against melanoma. We
show here that nelfinavir has excellent antitumor activity against
human melanoma cells in vitro. Nelfinavir induces both G1 cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. Nelfinavir causes
G1 arrest by dramatically reducing the activity of cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK2) and thereby causing dephosphorylation of the
retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor. Inhibition of CDK2 activity
by nelfinavir treatment is mediated in part by proteasomedependent degradation of Cdc25A phosphatase.

1 volume of Leibovitz’s L-15 medium, supplemented with 2% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 5 Ag/mL insulin, and 1.68 mmol/L CaCl2]. A375 cells were
grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mmol/L glutamine.
All cells were maintained at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator.
Chemicals and reagents. Nelfinavir mesylate tablets (Viracept) were
purchased from the manufacturer Pfizer, Inc (New York, NY). Tablets were
pulverized and suspended in a biphasic ethyl acetate (100 mL)/10% Na2CO3
aqueous solution (75 mL) mixture. The solution was stirred for 30 min, and
organic phase was separated from the aqueous phase via separatory funnel.
The aqueous layer was reextracted with ethyl acetate (2  50 mL). The
organic phases were combined, rinsed with saturated NaCl solution, and
desiccated over Na2SO4. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure
to yield nelfinavir free base. The product was then suspended in methylene
chloride (75 mL), and methanesulfonic acid (1.5 molar equivalents) was
added dropwise over 5-min period. The solution was stirred for additional
20 min followed by solvent removal under reduced pressure. The solid was
suspended in cold diethyl ether (30 mL) and filtered via a Buchner
apparatus to yield pure nelfinavir mesylate. The purity of nelfinavir
preparation was verified by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Purified
nelfinavir was dissolved in ethanol to make 20 mmol/L stock solution that
was used for all experiment in this study. MG-132 was purchased from
EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless noted otherwise. The antibodies used
in this study are as follows: Cdc25A (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA), CDK2 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and myc (Invitrogen, Santa Cruz, CA).
The following antibodies are from Cell Signaling (Danvers, CA): p21, p27,
Rb, phosphorylated Rb Ser608, Akt, phosphorylated Akt Ser473, phosphorylated Chk2 Thr68, and FLAG.
Cell counting analysis. Cells (1  105) were seeded in 12-well plates.
Nelfinavir was added to culture medium on the next day. After 24 or 48 h,
adherent cells were trypsinized and resuspended in culture medium
containing 0.2% trypan blue. The numbers of trypan blue–excluding cells
were counted using a hemocytometer. Triplicate wells were counted for
each condition. The data were presented as relative cell viability, in which
untreated cells at a given time point were set as 100%.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells (5  105) were seeded in 60-mm dishes
20 h before experiment. Cells were treated with 15 Amol/L nelfinavir or
equivalent ethanol vehicle for 8, 16, and 24 h. Adherent cells were then
trypsinized and resuspended in cold PBS with 1% FBS. Three volumes of
cold 75% ethanol were added in a dropwise manner while vortexing. Cells
were fixed for 24 h at 4jC, washed twice with cold PBS with 1% FBS,
and resuspended in PBS with 1% FBS, 10 Ag/mL propidium iodide, and
50 Ag/mL RNase A. Final cell suspensions were incubated at 37jC for
30 min followed by flow cytometry analysis. Flow cytometry data were
acquired using the Guava PCA system and analyzed using the Cell Cycle
module of CytoSoft software (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA). Data
shown in this article are representative of two independent experiments.
Melanoma spheroid assay. The method was adapted from Smalley
et al. (12). Briefly, 5,000 melanoma cells were seeded on top of 1.5% agarose in
96-well plate. After 72 h of incubation, melanoma spheroids were harvested
by aspiration and embedded in collagen gels that contained 2 mg/mL rat tail
type I collagen (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), Eagle’s MEM, L-glutamine,
2% FBS, and varying amounts of nelfinavir. Normal 2% melanoma medium
containing proper amount of nelfinavir was added on top of solidified
gel. After 72 h of incubation, spheroids were washed with PBS and stained
with calcein-AM and ethidium bromide for 1 h. Images of representative
spheroids were taken using an inverted fluorescent microscope.
Apoptosis assay. WM115 cells (5  105) were seeded in 60-mm dishes.
On the next day, cells were treated with either vehicle control (ethanol) or
varying concentrations of nelfinavir. After 24 and 48 h, cells (both floating
and adherent) were collected by trypsinization, washed once with 1 mL
1 Nexin buffer, and stained with Annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D
(7-AAD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Stained cells were
immediately analyzed with the Guava PCA system using the Nexin module
of CytoSoft software. Results shown are representative of two independent
experiments.

CDK2 kinase activity assay. Cells (both untreated and nelfinavir
treated) were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped off culture dishes, and
collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were snap frozen and stored at
80jC. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of kinase lysis
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1% Tween 20] supplemented with
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 Amol/Lleupeptin, 17 Ag/mL
aprotinin, 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate, 10 mmol/L NaF, and 1 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I and II (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lysates were incubated
on ice for 20 min with occasional vortexing and cleared by centrifugation at
13,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell lysates (each containing 200 Ag total protein in
500 AL volume) were mixed with 30 AL protein A agarose beads (Invitrogen)
and incubated with rocking for 30 min. Protein A beads were removed by
centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 3 min. Supernatants were mixed with 1 Ag
anti-CDK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated with rocking
overnight. Protein A beads were then added to each sample and incubated
for 2 h with rocking. Beads were washed twice with kinase lysis buffer and
twice with kinase reaction buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate, and
10 mmol/L NaF]. After the final wash, beads were resuspended with
56.5 AL reaction mixture (kinase reaction buffer plus 2 Amol/L ATP, 100 ng/
AL histone H1, and 0.1 ACi/AL [g-32P]ATP). Reactions were incubated at
30jC for 1 h and stopped by adding 10 AL 6 SDS sample buffer. Samples
were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by autoradiography.
Similar results were obtained from two independent experiments.
Immunoblotting assay. Cells were lysed with NP40 lysis buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40]
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Whole-cell lysates
were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane blots. Blots were incubated with respective primary
antibodies overnight. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies were used for chemiluminescence detection. Immunoblotting data
in this article are representative of at least two independent experiments.

Results
Nelfinavir inhibits cell growth and promotes apoptosis in
melanoma cell lines in vitro. We tested several HIV PIs for their
effect on growth of melanoma cell line WM35. Tested drugs include
nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and indinavir. The four drugs
showed very different activity against WM35 cells. Nelfinavir was
the most active drug, with a IC50 of f5.5 Amol/L. Ritonavir was
slightly less active than nelfinavir, whereas saquinavir and indinavir
had essentially no activity at concentrations up to 20 Amol/L
(Fig. 1A). Because nelfinavir showed the highest activity against
melanoma cells, we focused our subsequent investigations on this
drug.
The activity of nelfinavir against additional human melanoma
and colon cancer cell lines was determined as summarized in
Table 1. It is notable that the IC50 of nelfinavir for most tested cell
lines is between 5 and 12 Amol/L. This concentration is attainable
in the plasma of human patients who take nelfinavir at standard
dosage. Melanoma cell lines (WM35 and 1205LU) are more sensitive to nelfinavir than normal human melanocytes (HEMn-LP),
suggesting that transformed cells may be preferentially susceptible
to nelfinavir (Fig. 1B). It is also interesting to note that cell lines
derived from metastatic melanoma (C8161, 1205LU, and NIH1286)
are similarly susceptible to nelfinavir compared with cell lines
derived from early-stage melanoma (WM35 and WM115; Table 1).
Anchorage-independent growth is a unique characteristic of
transformed cells. We asked whether nelfinavir could block
anchorage-independent growth of melanoma cells. WM115 cells
that were seeded in soft agar gel formed large visible colonies
within 2 weeks. When these cells were grown in the presence of

Nelfinavir Inhibits Growth of Melanoma Cells

Figure 1. Nelfinavir inhibits growth of melanoma cells in vitro. A, WM35
melanoma cells were cultured in the presence of varying concentrations of
HIV PIs for 48 h. NFV, nelfinavir; RTV, ritonavir; SQV, saquinavir; INV, indinavir.
B, melanoma cells (WM35 and 1205LU) and normal melanocytes (HEMn-LP)
were cultured in the presence of varying concentrations of nelfinavir for 24 h.
Numbers of viable cells were counted using trypan blue staining. Data are

5 Amol/L nelfinavir, only very small colonies appeared. Growth in
soft agar gel was almost completely blocked by 10 Amol/L
nelfinavir (Fig. 2A).
A novel melanoma spheroid culture model has been developed
recently that mimics in vivo tumor microenvironment (12). We
tested the ability of nelfinavir to block growth of aggressive
melanoma cells in this model. Consistent with previous results,
spheroids formed by C8161 and 1205LU cells grew and invaded
rapidly into embedding collagen matrix. Nelfinavir inhibited
growth and invasion of both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2B). At 20 Amol/L, nelfinavir almost completely blocked
melanoma cell invasion into collagen matrix and greatly reduced
cell viability.
Microscopic observations revealed significant cell death, in
addition to growth arrest, after nelfinavir treatment (data not
shown). We therefore asked whether nelfinavir could also promote
apoptotic cell death. WM115 cells were treated with varying doses
of nelfinavir for 24 or 48 h after which apoptotic cells were
analyzed by Annexin V staining. Nelfinavir treatment increased the
population of both Annexin V–positive/7-AAD–negative cells (early
apoptotic) and Annexin V–positive/7-AAD–positive (late apoptotic/dead) cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C).
Nelfinavir induces G1 cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells
through inhibition of CDK2. Cell cycle arrest is an important
antitumor mechanism of radiotherapy/chemotherapy. We asked
whether the antitumor activity of nelfinavir involved cell cycle
arrest. Nelfinavir treatment caused a marked G1 arrest in WM35

www.aacrjournals.org

cells as indicated by increased percentage of cells at G1 phase and
decreased percentage of cells at S and G2-M phase. The G1 arrest
was evident after nelfinavir treatment as short as 8 h and reached
maximal extent by 24 h (Fig. 2D). Similar results were observed in
WM115 and A375 cells (data not shown).
CDKs play key roles in regulating cell cycle progression in
eukaryotic cells. Among mammalian CDKs, CDK2 is considered a
master switch that controls G1-S cell cycle progression. The beststudied substrate of CDK2 is the Rb protein. CDK2 phosphorylates
Rb at multiple serine and threonine residues, which causes
dissociation of Rb from E2F family of transcription factors. Free
E2F then activates transcription of target genes that are required
for DNA synthesis (13). To elucidate the mechanism of nelfinavirinduced G1 arrest, we investigated the effect of nelfinavir on the
CDK2-Rb pathway. Nelfinavir treatment caused a sharp decline
in CDK2 activity within 24 h (Fig. 3A). The kinetics of CDK2
inactivation is consistent with that of nelfinavir-induced G1 arrest.
CDK2 inactivation was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation
of Rb at Ser608 (Fig. 3B). Total Rb protein level remained unchanged
after nelfinavir treatment. These data suggest that inactivation of
CDK2-Rb axis is an important mechanism of nelfinavir-induced G1
cell cycle arrest.
Activity of CDK2 is regulated at multiple levels: protein level of
CDK2 and its binding partner cyclin E, binding of CDK inhibitors
p21 or p27 to cyclin E-CDK2 complex, and post-translational
modification of CDK2. Phosphorylation of CDK2 at Thr14 and Tyr15
by Wee1 kinase inhibits CDK2 activity. Phosphorylated groups at
Thr14 and Tyr15 can be removed by Cdc25A phosphatase, resulting
in CDK2 activation. To elucidate how nelfinavir inhibits CDK2
activity, we examined the level of several key CDK2 regulators.
Nelfinavir treatment did not significantly change the level of CDK2
itself or cyclin E in either WM115 or A375 cells. CDK inhibitors p21
and p27 were strongly induced by nelfinavir treatment in WM115
cells but not in A375 cells (Fig. 3C and D). The induction of p27 in
WM115 cells occurred rather early (2 h), whereas p21 induction
was only detected after 24 h. In both WM115 and A375 cells,
nelfinavir treatment induced a sharp decrease in the level of
Cdc25A phosphatase. Decrease in Cdc25A level either preceded
(in WM115 cell) or coincided (in A375 cell) with CDK2 inactivation, suggesting that the decrease in Cdc25A is likely the
primary factor that causes CDK2 inactivation and cell cycle arrest
(Fig. 3C and D).

Proteasomal degradation plays an important role in the
regulation of Cdc25A. In DNA damage-induced G1 checkpoint,
DNA damage activates the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2 signaling cascade
(14). Activated Chk1 or Chk2 phosphorylates Cdc25A at several

serine residues (most notably Ser76 and Ser124), which promotes
association of Cdc25A with E3 ubiquitin ligase, such as h-TrCP, and
subsequent polyubiquitination/degradation (15–17). We decided to
investigate whether down-regulation of Cdc25A by nelfinavir was

agar plates that were overlaid with medium containing varying amounts of nelfinavir. Cells were cultured for 14 d and observed with inverted phase-contrast
microscope. B, nelfinavir inhibits growth of melanoma spheroids in collagen gel. C8161 and 1205LU cells were grown for 3 d as spheroids embedded in type I collagen
gel. Cells were stained with calcein-AM and ethidium bromide and observed with inverted fluorescent microscope. Live cells were stained green (calcein-AM) and dead
cells were stained red (ethidium bromide). C, nelfinavir promotes apoptotic cell death of melanoma cells. WM115 cells were incubated with varying amounts of
nelfinavir or vehicle control [ethanol (EtOH )] for 48 h. Both adherent and floating cells were then harvested, pooled, and stained with Annexin V-phycoerythrin
and 7-AAD. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Top, representative flow cytometry dot plot; bottom, bar graph showing percentage of early apoptotic cells

propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. Percentage of cell in each phase is indicated. Data are representative of two independent experiments. Similar results
were observed with WM115 and A375 cells (data not shown).

nelfinavir treatment, whereas both mutants remained stable after
nelfinavir treatment.
Taken together, these data showed that nelfinavir treatment
promoted proteasomal degradation of Cdc25A that was dependent
on both the DSG and KEN degradation motifs. In addition,
nelfinavir activated Thr68 phosphorylation of Chk2, suggesting that
activated ATM-Chk2 signaling pathway may be involved in
nelfinavir-induced degradation of Cdc25A.
Inhibition of Akt signaling is an unlikely mechanism. Several
studies suggested that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/
Akt signaling was an important antitumor mechanism of HIV PIs.
Srirangam et al. (10) showed that 24 h of ritonavir treatment
decreased Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt in breast cancer cell lines.
Gupta et al. (11) showed that treatment of cells harboring activated
Akt allele with subcytotoxic doses of HIV PIs led to decreased
Akt phosphorylation after prolonged incubation. In both cases,
the mechanisms by which HIV PIs inhibit Akt signaling were
unknown.
We asked whether nelfinavir also led to inhibition of Akt
signaling in melanoma cells. WM35, WM115, and A375 cells were
incubated with nelfinavir for varying times. Cell lysates were

also mediated by this pathway. First, we asked whether proteasome
inhibitor would block nelfinavir-induced Cdc25A down-regulation.
WM115 cells were pretreated with either DMSO (vehicle control) or
5 Amol/L MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor) and then treated with
15 Amol/L nelfinavir for varying times. Immunoblotting showed
that MG-132 completely abolished nelfinavir-induced decrease of
Cdc25A level, suggesting that the down-regulation of Cdc25A by
nelfinavir is indeed mediated by proteasomal degradation (Fig. 4A).
Next, we examined Thr68 phosphorylation level of Chk2 after
nelfinavir treatment. Thr68 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for
activation of Chk2. Nelfinavir treatment significantly increased
Thr68 phosphorylation of Chk2 as revealed by immunoblotting
(Fig. 4B).
Finally, we examined the effect of mutations in Cdc25A
degradation motifs on nelfinavir-induced degradation. Two degradation motifs in Cdc25A have been characterized, the D81S82G83
motif and the K141E142N143 motif, which are required for h-TrCP–
mediated or APC/C-Cdh1–mediated ubiquitination, respectively
(15, 16). WM115 cells were transfected with either wild-type or
mutant Cdc25A cDNA that harbors mutation in either the DSG
motif (S76A/S82A/S88A, SA mutant) or the KEN motif (K141A/
E142A/N143A, K2M mutant). Ectopically expressed Cdc25A was
detected by immunoblotting using epitope-specific antibodies. As
shown in Fig. 4C, wild-type Cdc25A was degraded efficiently after

Figure 4. Nelfinavir induces proteasome-dependent degradation of Cdc25A.
A, WM115 cells were pretreated with either DMSO or 5 Amol/L MG-132 for

concentration. Cells were harvested after varying incubation times. Cell lysates
were subjected to immunoblotting for Cdc25A. B, WM115 cells were treated
with 15 Amol/L nelfinavir or 20 Amol/L camptothecin (campto ) for indicated
time. Lysates from untreated and treated cells were immunoblotted for
Thr68-phosphorylated Chk2. Camptothecin-treated cells serve as positive control
for Chk2 phosphorylation. Actin was used as loading control. C, WM115 cells
were transfected with various Cdc25A expression plasmids: myc -tagged
wild-type, FLAG-tagged K2M mutant, or FLAG-tagged SA mutant. Forty-eight
hours after transfection, cells were treated with either ethanol or nelfinavir
(15 Amol/L) for indicated time. Ectopically expressed Cdc25A was detected by
immunoblotting using myc or FLAG antibody.

Figure 5. Inhibition of Akt signaling is an unlikely antitumor mechanism of
nelfinavir for melanoma cells. A, melanoma cells (WM35 , WM115 , and A375 )
were treated with nelfinavir for indicated time. Nelfinavir dosage is as follows:
10 Amol/L for WM35 and 15 Amol/L for WM115 and A375. Ser 473-phosphorylated
Akt and total Akt were detected by immunoblotting. B, WM115 and A375

subjected to immunoblotting analysis to detect Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt. In all three cell lines, nelfinavir treatment
significantly increased Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt, whereas total
Akt protein level was not affected (Fig. 5A). Akt phosphorylation
was elevated rapidly (within 2–2.5 h) in all three cell lines.
Interestingly, elevated Akt phosphorylation was sustained for up to
24 h in WM35 and WM115 cells but transient in A375 cells.
Subcytotoxic dosage of nelfinavir (2–5 Amol/L) had no significant
effect on Akt phosphorylation even after 72 h of incubation
(Fig. 5B). We conclude that nelfinavir does not inhibit Akt signaling
pathway in melanoma cells. Therefore, inhibition of Akt signaling is
unlikely to be a major antitumor mechanism of nelfinavir in
melanoma cells.

Discussion
In this study, we present preclinical data on the antitumor
activity of HIV PI nelfinavir in human melanoma cell lines.
Nelfinavir inhibits growth of most cancer cell lines in our test
panel with IC50 between 5 and 12 Amol/L. Importantly, this is a
concentration that is comparable with peak plasma concentration
in patients and healthy volunteers who take nelfinavir at
recommended dose. In a phase I/II trial, nelfinavir was administered to HIV-infected patients at a dosage of 500 or 750 mg thrice
daily. Peak plasma concentration of nelfinavir in these patients was
in the range of 3 to 4 Ag/mL (4.5–6.0 Amol/L; ref. 18). In another

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

study, healthy volunteers were given once-daily combination of
2,000 mg nelfinavir and low-dose (200 or 400 mg) ritonavir.
Peak plasma nelfinavir concentration of 5.1 to 7.2 Ag/mL (7.7–10.8
Amol/L) was detected (19). Furthermore, because serious doselimiting toxicity has not been observed for nelfinavir, it is possible
to administer nelfinavir at an even higher dose and in combination
with ritonavir, which is known to increase drug exposure of
nelfinavir (20), to achieve therapeutic drug level that exceeds
in vitro IC50 in human patients. Another interesting finding from
this study is that cell lines derived from metastatic melanoma,
which are usually more resistant to conventional cytotoxic agents,
are similarly susceptible to nelfinavir treatment compared with cell
lines derived from early-stage melanoma. This suggests that
nelfinavir may act on cancer cells with a mechanism distinct from
those of conventional chemotherapeutics.
Conventional cell culture on plastic dishes is often regarded as
an inadequate model for testing cancer therapeutics partly because
it does not reflect the interaction between cancer cells with its
stromal matrix. A novel melanoma spheroid model has been
developed recently in which melanoma cells were grown as threedimensional spheroids and then embedded in type I collagen gel to
mimic the in vivo tumor microenvironment (12). This model is
expected to give better prediction of in vivo response of novel
cancer therapeutics. Nelfinavir shows excellent activity in this
assay, blocking both growth and invasion of metastatic melanoma
cells. The effective dosage of nelfinavir in this assay (>10 Amol/L) is
higher than that for two-dimensional culture, which probably
reflects the prosurvival property of collagen matrix.
We further investigated the effects of nelfinavir on melanoma
cells in additional in vitro assays. Nelfinavir inhibits anchorageindependent growth, promotes apoptotic cell death, and induces
G1 cell cycle arrest. It is likely that apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest both contribute to the antitumor activity of nelfinavir. We
investigated the molecular mechanism of nelfinavir-induced G1
cell cycle arrest in further detail. Nelfinavir treatment induces
dramatic decrease in the activity of CDK2, the master kinase
that controls G1-S progression in mammalian cells. Inhibition of
CDK2 activity is not due to decreased protein level of CDK2 or
its cyclin partner cyclin E. Although nelfinavir does lead to
accumulation of CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 in WM115 cell line,
this effect is not observed in another cell line, A375. A more
likely mechanism of CDK2 inhibition is decreased level of
Cdc25A phosphatase, which is observed in both WM115 and
A375 cells.
Cdc25A is an essential component of the ATR/ATM-Chk1/Chk2Cdc25A signaling cascade that controls G1-S checkpoint. In
response to DNA damage caused by ionizing irradiation or
replication block, ATM/ATR kinases are activated that in turn
phosphorylate and activate Chk1/Chk2 kinases. Chk1/Chk2 kinases
directly phosphorylate Cdc25A primarily on Ser76 or Ser124
depending on the specific stimuli. Phosphorylation by Chk1/Chk2
promotes ubiquitination of Cdc25A by E3 ubiquitin ligases (such as
h-TrCP) and rapid proteasomal degradation. In this study, we
present evidence, which suggests that nelfinavir induces Cdc25A
degradation via a similar mechanism. First, nelfinavir-induced
Cdc25A degradation is dependent on proteasome activity. Second,
nelfinavir induces activation of Chk2 kinase. Third, degradation of
Cdc25A after nelfinavir treatment is dependent on two degradation
motifs in Cdc25A protein: the KEN box and the DSG motif. Mutant
Cdc25A proteins that harbor point mutations in either motif
cannot be degraded after nelfinavir treatment.

Nelfinavir Inhibits Growth of Melanoma Cells

It was previously reported that ritonavir could inhibit the
chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome (21). This has
been cited as an antitumor mechanism of ritonavir (6). However,
it seems to us that direct inhibition of proteasome by nelfinavir
is probably not the primary antitumor mechanism due to the
following reasons. First, in the original report (21), nelfinavir did
not inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of 20 S proteasome even
at a concentration of 100 Amol/L (which far exceeds IC50 of
nelfinavir for any melanoma cell lines tested). Second, our data
show that nelfinavir promotes proteasomal degradation of Cdc25A,
which is incompatible with the proteasome inhibition hypothesis.
Third, although we did observe accumulation of p21 and p27 after
nelfinavir treatment in WM115 cell line (which would agree with
the proteasome inhibition hypothesis), such effect was not
observed in A375 cells, suggesting that accumulation of CDK
inhibitors may not be a universal phenomenon.
Other investigators showed that HIV PIs (including nelfinavir)
inhibit Akt signaling in tumor cell lines (10, 11). We did not observe
inhibition of Akt signaling by nelfinavir in melanoma cells. Instead,
we observed rapid elevation of Akt phosphorylation that indicated
active Akt signaling. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is
unknown. It is paradoxical that nelfinavir treatment leads to Akt
activation in melanoma cells because Akt signaling is generally
linked with cell proliferation and survival. However, our data show
that nelfinavir induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in melanoma
cells despite activated Akt signaling. We speculate that activation
of Akt signaling may not be the direct result of nelfinavir action but
rather reflects cellular responses to stress condition imposed by
nelfinavir, a scenario analogous to Akt activation in response to
glucose deprivation (22).
The molecular target(s) of nelfinavir (or HIV PIs in general) in
cancer cells remains unknown. It is even uncertain whether
different PIs share the same target or not. It was recently proposed
that heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) might be a target for ritonavir

(10). Ritonavir binds Hsp90 with a K d of 7.8 Amol/L and partially
inhibits its chaperone activity. The relevance of Hsp90 to nelfinavir
is not clear. The identification of the nelfinavir targets will be
essential for the understanding of its antitumor mechanism. We are
currently pursuing in this direction using biochemical and
proteomic approaches.
Several features of nelfinavir make it an excellent chemotherapeutic candidate. The drug is very safe, which may be administered
daily over many months or years. Unlike conventional chemotherapies, there are few hematologic, gastrointestinal, or neurologic
side effects associated with nelfinavir. The drug has excellent
bioavailability and well-characterized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. These features suggest that in vitro
antitumor activity of nelfinavir is likely to be translatable into
antitumor activity in animal models and even in clinical trials.
In summary, nelfinavir shows excellent in vitro activity against
human melanoma cell lines. Nelfinavir inhibits cell growth by
arresting cells at G1 phase, which is mediated by proteasomal
degradation of Cdc25A and concomitant inactivation of CDK2.
Although the direct target(s) of nelfinavir remains unknown, our
data argue that nelfinavir is a promising chemotherapeutic drug
with potentially novel antitumor mechanisms. Further preclinical
investigation in animal models and, potentially, clinical trial with
advanced melanoma patients is warranted.
