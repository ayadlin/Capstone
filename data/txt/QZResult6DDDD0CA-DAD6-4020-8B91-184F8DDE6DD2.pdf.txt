ABSTRACT
Secretion of VGF is increased in cerebrospinal fluid and blood in neurodegenerative
disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and VGF is a potential biomarker for these
disorders. We have shown that VGF is expressed in peripheral T cells and is correlated
with T cell survival and cytokine secretion. The frequency of VGF+CD3+ T cells
increases with normal aging. We found an increased number of VGF-expressing T cells
in patients with AD compared to aged healthy controls, which was associated with
enhanced HbA1c levels in blood. Upon treatment with rivastigmine, T cell proliferation
and VGF expression in AD patients decreased to the level found in controls. Moreover,
rapamycin treatment in vitro reduced the number of VGF+CD3+ cells in AD patients
to control levels.

INTRODUCTION

blood [4].
In this context, the growth factor VGF may provide
a link between central nervous system pathology and
systemic immune and energy metabolism changes in
AD. VGF is synthesized by neurons in the brain where
it promotes growth and survival of neurons [5], and is
involved in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and energy
homeostasis [6]. VGF is synthesized initially as a larger
precursor, which undergoes proteolytic processing to
produce smaller bioactive peptides that are secreted into
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Expression of
VGF is induced by other growth factors, such as nerve
growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), neurotrophin 3, fibroblast growth factors
and insulin. Since previous studies have shown that
altered secretion of these factors occurs in neurological
and psychiatric disorders, VGF peptides may also
be biomarkers for AD, frontotemporal dementia or
schizophrenia [7].

Epidemiological studies indicate that the population
of people aged more than 65 years is constantly growing
[1]. Therefore, the study of age-related diseases such as
neurodegenerative or cardiovascular disorders is becoming
more important. The number of patients suffering from
Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is expected to triple by the year
2050 [2]. AD is a progressive disorder characterized by a
loss of memory and cognitive functions with behavioural
alterations. The key neuropathological hallmarks of
AD are extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain and
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, accompanied by
the loss of neurons, white matter and synapses [3]. The
plaques are often surrounded by activated microglia and
inflammation may also be important in the pathogenesis of
AD since increased concentrations of several inflammatory
mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α),
interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1ß have also been detected in

Similar to other brain-associated factors, VGF
has also been detected in peripheral human leukocytes
[8]. Recently, we investigated VGF expression in T
cells of mentally healthy persons aged between 22 and
88 years and detected an age-dependent increase in the
number of VGF+CD3+ T cells that correlated with
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index
(BMI) [9]. T cells are known to be involved in healthy
brain functions such as spatial learning, memory [10]
and adult neurogenesis [11]. In addition, they have been
implicated in neurodegenerative disorders like AD [12, 13]
by regulating and maintaining inflammatory responses in
the brain and periphery. Since currently used medications
can only decelerate neurodegeneration for a certain time,
new therapeutic treatment options for these disorders are
needed. For example, studies have shown that the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin reduces amyloid-beta levels, abolishes
cognitive deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer´s disease
[14] and suppresses brain aging in rats [15].
T cells are known to produce acetylcholine (ACh)
[16] and may therefore be affected by ACh inhibitors
that are commonly used to treat AD patients. Therefore,
we analyzed T cell VGF expression in AD patients
and matched healthy controls and tested for effects of
treatment with the Ach inhibitor rivastigmine on the
number of VGF+CD3+ T cells.

patients at the time of diagnosis (Fig. 1). The HbA1c level
was determined during routine blood analysis as an 8–12
week integrated average blood glucose measurement. At
the time of diagnosis, AD patients showed a trend towards
higher HbA1c (6.7%) compared to controls (5.7%;
p=0.060; Fig. 1).

Expression of VGF decreases during treatment of
AD patients with rivastigmine
The number of VGF+CD3+ T cells was also
determined after treatment of AD patients with
rivastigmine patches for 12 and 30 weeks. This showed
that the VGF+CD3+ T cell percentage decreased from
15.05% at week 0 (before treatment initiation) to 14.31%
at week 12 and to 6.0% at week 30 (p=0.001; Fig. 2).

Proliferation of T cells is influenced by
rivastigmine treatment
To measure the influence of rivastigmine treatment
on T cell proliferation, cells were stimulated with either
anti-CD3 or a combination of phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. The proliferation index
(PI) was calculated by dividing the value of ³H-thymidine
incorporation in stimulated cell cultures by that in
untreated cells (medium control). The PI of anti-CD3stimulated T cells at the time of diagnosis was 361.2 and
this was reduced after the 12 week rivastigmine treatment
to 48.0 (p=0.024). Stimulation with PMA/ionomycin
resulted in a PI of 294.8 which was reduced to 33.4 after
the treatment period (p= 0.032; Fig. 3).

RESULTS
Expression of VGF and Hb1Ac levels are
enhanced in AD patients
We determined the number of VGF+CD3+ T cells
in parallel to HbA1c in AD patients, given the previous
association found for these two factors in normal aging
[9]. On average 8.45% of CD3+ T cells expressed VGF in
healthy controls. However, the frequency of VGF+CD3+
T cells was significantly higher at 15.05% (p=0.032) in AD

DISCUSSION

in the presence or absence of rapamycin and determined
the frequency of VGF+CD3+ T cells by flow cytometry.
In cells treated without rapamycin, the percentage of
VGF+CD3+ T cells was 9.56% in controls and13.65%
in AD patients (p=0.0284). Treatment with rapamycin
decreased the number of VGF+CD3+ T cells in AD
patients to 9.1% (p=0.0197).

In this study, we showed that VGF is expressed
in a higher percentage of peripheral CD3+ T cells from
AD patients compared to age-matched neuropsychiatric
healthy volunteers. Upon treatment with rivastigmine, the
percentage of VGF+CD3+ T cells decreased to the level
found in control persons.

Figure 2: Frequency of VGF+CD3+ T cells decreases upon rivastigmine treatment. Upon diagnosis of AD (week 0),
treatment with rivastigmine patches was initiated. VGF expression was determined in peripheral T cells after 12 weeks and 30 weeks of
constant medication.

mean of anti-CD3-stimulated cultures by that of medium controls (left) and by dividing the mean of PMA/Ionomycin-stimulated cultures
by that of medium controls (right).

T lymphocytes are key components of the immune
system which also exert pro-cognitive functions [17].
Brain-specific T cells could have beneficial roles in
the protection against neurodegeneration by several
mechanisms, such as enhancing uptake of cell debris by
microglia [18, 19], release of anti-inflammatory cytokines
[20, 21], increasing the capacity for buffering glutamate
toxicity [22, 23], increased expression of neurotrophic
factors [19, 24, 25] and enhanced neurogenesis [11,
26-28]. However, effector and regulatory functions of
lymphocytes are compromised during aging [29, 30],
a process called immunosenescence. Further immune
manifestations accompany the progression of AD [4,
31], with negative effects on brain function and neuronal
repair processes in general. This includes the deposition
of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular
neurofibrillary tangles and the associated induction of
inflammatory reactions in the brain [32].
Previous studies have shown that Aβ-specific T cells
are not suitable as biomarkers for AD, as the frequency of
Aβ-specific T cells is significantly increased both in elderly
healthy individuals and patients with AD [33]. Moreover,
we have shown that an immune response against brainspecific proteins is found in patients with dementia as well
as in aged people without neuropsychiatric disorders [9,
34, 35]. However, other studies have found differences
in brain-specific miRNAs in blood from AD patients
and healthy controls [36, 37]. Here, we found that VGF
is expressed at a higher frequency in T cells from AD
patients compared with those from aged-matched healthy
controls. This is consistent with previous studies which
found changes in the VGF level in brain or CSF from
schizophrenia [38], depressive disorder [39], Parkinson’s
and Alzheimer’s disease patients [40, 41], as compared
to the respective healthy control populations. We also
found previously that blocking VGF reduced the cytokine
secretion and proliferation of T cells, suggesting that the
enhanced frequency of VGF-expressing T cells from AD
patients reflects a higher inflammatory state.
Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides can modulate
the functions of immune cells such as T cells, myeloid
cells or dendritic cells when released into the blood.
Moreover, T cells themselves produce growth factors
like NGF [42, 43], BDNF [44, 45], and insulin/ insulinlike growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) [46]Production
of these factors is increased in activated T cells, as
found in inflammation [43], and may induce VGF via an
autocrine mechanism. Here, we showed that treatment
with the acetlycholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine led to
decreased VGF expression and T cell proliferation to the
levels detected in control T cells. Treatment of cognitive
impairment in AD patients [47] with acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors have also been found to decrease the production
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induced the secretion
of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 [48]. T cells
express both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

receptors and choline acetytransferase [49]. The latter
synthesizes ACh which is released from T cells and acts
as an immunomodulator [50]. Rivastigmine treatment
stimulates ACh release which subsequently induces
cholinergic receptor activation. The drug suppresses α7
nAChR-dependent the T-cell proliferation [51], as we have
shown here for anti-CD3- and PMA/Ionomycin-induced
T cell proliferation. However, while T cell proliferation
was reduced 12 weeks after beginning of rivastigmine
treatment, VGF expression was diminished only after 30
weeks. This suggests that VGF is mainly expressed by
activated T cells.
Previous studies have shown that VGF peptides
are involved in regulation of several functions, including
energy balance homeostasis [52]. We have already
described a positive correlation between HbA1C and
the frequency of VGF-positive T cells [9]. Here we
show that AD patients have an increased HbA1C level
compared to aged-matched controls. Increased Previous
studies have shown that HbA1c levels are correlated with
plasma Aβ1-42 concentrations [53] and mild cognitive
impairment or dementia [54]. Moreover, elevated
HbA1c levels are associated with insulin resistance [56],
cardiovascular diseases [54], which could also be linked
to the development of neurodegenerative disorders [55].
Our data identify VGF as a biomarker for AD that involves
peripheral inflammation as well as long-term glucose
levels.
As with insulin and insulin-like growth factor
1 (IGF-1) signalling, the mTOR (the molecular
target of rapamycin) pathway, has been implicated
in aging according to the hyperfunction theory [57,
58]. Specifically, mTOR regulates cellular biomass by
promoting protein translation and inhibiting autophagy.
Consequently, blockade of mTOR signalling via
rapamycin treatment has anti-aging and neuroprotective
effects, and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic
pharmacological compound to restrict neurodegenerative
disorders [59] such as AD [60-62].
It is generally accepted that aging is the greatest
risk factor for AD. We have already described an ageassociated increase in VGF-expressing T cells in healthy
volunteers [8] and here we have shown that treatment
of PBMCs with both rivastigmine and rapamycin in
vitro reduces the number of these cells in AD patients.
Halloran et al. have shown that chronic inhibition of
mTOR by rapamycin treatment in mice enhances learning
and memory and modulates their behavior throughout
their lifespan [66], an effect mediated by IL-1β and
NMDA signalling [67]. Therefore, rapamycin could be
an effective cognition-improving drug in AD. This may
also be achieved via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
effects of rapamycin [77-80], leading to a reduction of
Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which normally
contribute to the progressive cognitive deficits of AD [7072]. The present findings suggest that peripheral VGF

Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA) and analyzed
using FlowJo software (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).
Data were analyzed using biexponential transformation for
complete data visualization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Measurement of cell proliferation

Study population

CD3+ T cells were isolated using the Pan T cell kit
(Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and
AutoMacs separation. CD3+ T cells were resuspended in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1%
antibiotics and plated in triplicate at a density of 1x106
cells/ml in 96-well plates. T cells were stimulated with
PMA/ Ionomycin (1mg/ml) and anti-CD3 (0.5µl/100µl;
eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) for 3 days.
³H-Thymidine (0.2µCi/well) was added to the cultures
for the last 17 hours Then cells were harvested and
³H-Thymidine incorporation was measured as an index of
lymphocyte proliferation in a betaplate liqid scintillation
counter (Wallac). Proliferation of T cells was calculated
by division of the mean value of each triplicate of antiCD3- or PMA/ Ionomycin-stimulated cell cultures by that
of control medium cultures.

The study was performed in accordance with
German laws, the Declaration of Helsinki and guidelines
of the local institutional review board. Written consent
was obtained from all patients and healthy controls. We
collected 18 ml blood from 24 AD patients and 14 matched
controls without neuropsychiatric disorders (suppl. table
1). Routine blood analysis were performed, including
differential blood cell count, levels of C-reactive protein,
glucose, lipids, liver enzymes and thyroid hormones. None
of the subjects were excluded due to changes in these
routine blood parameters. Also, no person had a history
of autoimmune disorders, immunomodulating treatment,
cancer, chronic terminal disease, severe cardiovascular
disorder, substance abuse or severe trauma.

Treatment of AD patients

Treatment of PBMC with rapamycin in vitro

Within the first six weeks after diagnosis, AD
patients received patches with 4.6 mg rivastigmine,
followed by patches with 9.5 mg rivastigmineuntil the end
of the study. Patches were changed each day.

Isolated PBMCs from AD patients and controls
were cultured for 24h in complete RPMI medium with or
without addition of rapamycin (200 ng/ml). The cells were
harvested and expression of VGF on CD3+ T cells was
measured using flow cytometry.

Preparation of peripheral blood monocyte cells
(PBMC)

Statistical analysis

Blood was collected in BD Vacutainer lithium
heparin-treated tubes (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA,
USA), and diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were prepared by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll
Paque (Biochrom AG, Berlin) at 375g for 20 min at room
temperature. The cells were harvested and washed twice in
PBS. Cells were then suspended in Fluorescence Assisted
Cell Sorting (FACS) staining buffer (PBS w/ 0.5% BSA)
and cell numbers determined.

Diagnostic group differences were calculated using
Student’s t test or ANOVA. Significance was defined as
p< 0.05, while a probability level of 0.05≤ p< 0.10 was
considered as a statistical trend.
