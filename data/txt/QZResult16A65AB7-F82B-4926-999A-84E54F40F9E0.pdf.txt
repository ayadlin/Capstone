ABSTRACT
Cisplatin can cause intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks between purine bases
and is a chemotherapeutic drug widely used to treat cancer. However, the major
barrier to the efficacy of the treatment is drug resistance. Homologous recombination
(HR) plays a central role in restoring stalled forks caused by DNA lesions. Here, we
report that chronic treatment with cisplatin induces HR to confer cisplatin resistance
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. A high frequency of sister chromatid
exchanges (SCE) occurs in the cisplatin-resistant NPC cells. In addition, several genes
in the Fanconi anemia (FA) and template switching (TS) pathways show elevated
expression. Significantly, depletion of HR gene BRCA1, TS gene UBC13, or FA gene
FANCD2 suppresses SCE and causes cells to accumulate in the S phase, concomitantly
with high γH2AX foci formation in the presence of low-dose cisplatin. Consistent
with this result, depletion of several genes in the HR, TS, or FA pathway sensitizes
the cisplatin-resistant NPC cells to cisplatin. Our results suggest that the enhanced
HR, in coordination with the FA and TS pathways, underlies the cisplatin resistance.
Targeting the HR, TS, or FA pathways could be a potential therapeutic strategy for
treating cisplatin-resistant cancer.

treatments is drug resistance. Multiple pathways that
mediate intrinsic or acquired resistance to drugs have been
identified, including increased efflux pumps, increased
detoxification, and decreased import [2]. Recently, a few

repair may also underlie the mechanism of drug-resistance
[3-6]. However, very few DNA repair genes have been
validated in vivo so far. Cisplatin binds to DNA to form
intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks between purine
bases. When DNA replication machinery encounters the
cisplatin-caused DNA damage, it stalls DNA replication,
and prolonged stalling of replication forks eventually
leads to fork collapse and the generation of replicationdependent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) [7, 8].
To prevent stalling of replication caused by cisplatin,
cells have evolved the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway
in coordination with post-replication repair (PRR) and
homologous recombination (HR) to resolve the cisplatincaused DNA damage [9, 10].
The FA pathway is essential to the repair of
interstrand cross-links caused by cisplatin and related
compounds [9, 10]. This pathway is composed of at least
15 genes, which are named FANCA through FANCP.
FANCA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M form the core ubiquitin E3
ligase, which promotes the monoubiquitination of
FANCD2 and FANCI in response to crosslink-types of
DNA damage during the S phase [11]. Monoubiquitination
of FANCD2 and FANCI is the key regulatory step in
the pathway, which recruits several nucleases including
FAN1, SLX4, MUS81-EME1, and XPF-ERCC1 to the
site of repair to initiate the incision [12-16]. This process
generates DSBs which are subsequently repaired by HR.
Importantly, several HR components are part of the FA
pathway. BRCA2, which is also called FANCD1, is one
of FA subunit. FANCN, also called PALB2, binds and
regulates localization of BRCA2. These proteins facilitate
the loading of RAD51 to initiate the HR process [8-10,
17, 18].
Post-replication repair (PRR) is known to prevent
prolonged stalling of replication forks [19, 20]. The
unique feature of PRR is that it bypasses DNA lesions to
resolve arrested forks without removing the actual damage
[19]. Recent studies in yeast and higher eukaryotes
have revealed that the regulation of PRR occurs via the
sumolation or ubiquitination of PCNA [21-30]. PRR
can be divided into two sub-pathways, the translesion
synthesis (TLS) and template switching (TS) pathways.
The importance of the TLS pathway has been extensively
studied. TLS utilizes low fidelity DNA polymerases (TLS
polymerases) such as Polη, Polι, Polζ, Polκ, and Rev1,
and allows cells to replicate over DNA lesions [31].
Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that these TLS
polymerases are involved in bypassing the unhooked
cross-linked nucleotides, and thus restore the nascent
strand [32, 33]. In addition, deletion of TLS polymerases
sensitizes cells to cisplatin [31, 34, 35]. Suppression
of Rev3, the catalytic subunit of Polζ, sensitizes drug
resistant lung tumors to chemotherapy [4]. Importantly,
TLS polymerase polζ is responsible for the variant form
of xeroderma pigmentosum (XPV), an inherited disorder
associated with high incidence of sunlight-induced skin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancers [36].
By contrast, the mechanism of the TS pathway is
poorly understood in mammalian cells. It remains elusive
whether the TS pathway is incorporated into the FA
pathway, similar to the TLS pathway. The TS pathway is
mediated by the K63-linked polyubiquitin chain at K164
of PCNA. The K63-linked polyubiquitin is catalyzed by
the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBC13 and MMS2,
and E3 ubiquitin ligases SHPRH and HLTF [25, 27, 28,
37, 38]. The K63-linked polyubiquitin chain is thought
to function in signal transduction pathways presumably
by recruiting proteins involved in the TS mechanism.
Although the mechanism of the TS pathway is not clear,
one model suggests that a stalled fork caused by the DNA
lesions might undergo the fork regression that allows the
original template strands to anneal, thereby extruding
newly synthesized DNA strands as a short duplex, a
structure similar to a “chicken foot” [38]. However, more
and more recent evidence supports an alternative template
switching model [17, 33]. The nascent strand impeded by
DNA lesions could invade the opposite undamaged sister
chromatid and replicate DNA by using the undamaged
sister strand as a template, thus forming a double Holliday
junction. The resolution of the Holliday junction leads to
the generation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) [17,
33, 39]. Indeed, recent discoveries demonstrate that HLTF
is involved in the strand invasion mechanism that can
promote gap filling during replication of damaged DNA
[40]. In addition, several lines of evidence have shown
that HR components, such as RAD51, MRE11, BRCA1,
and BRCA2, are involved in the resolving of stalled forks
[33, 41-44].
Therefore, both the FA and TS pathways converge
to the HR components to resolve stalled forks caused by
DNA damage. However, it remains elusive whether the
TS pathway is involved in restoring stalled forks caused
by cisplatin and whether the TS pathway is enhanced in
the drug-resistant phenotype of cancer. Here, we report
that chronic treatment of cisplatin can induce elevated
expression of several genes in the HR, TS, and FA
pathways in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells.
UBC13, HLTF, and SHPRH in the TS pathway, RAD51
and BRCA1 in the HR pathway, and FANCD2 in the
FA pathway are highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. Consistent
with these results, these cisplatin resistant cells exhibit
the elevated SCE frequency. Depletion of the HR gene
BRCA1, the TS gene UBC13, or the FA gene FANCD2,
dramatically reduces SCE frequency. In addition, these
HR-, TS- or FA-deficient cells are sensitive to cisplatin
and arrest in the S phase in chronic low-dose treatment
with cisplatin. Since chronic low-dose treatment with
cisplatin induces DNA damage and cell apoptosis in
these HR-, TS- or FA-deficient cells, our results suggest
the importance of HR in coordination with the TS and
FA pathways in cell survival, as well as the importance

of damage bypass mechanism during chronic low-dose
treatment with cisplatin. Our results further suggest that
targeting the HR, TS or FA pathways could be a potential
therapeutic strategy for treating cisplatin-resistant cancer.

5µM cisplatin indeed causes DNA damage in HONE1, but
such treatment causes DNA damage to a lesser extent in
HONE6 cells, as judged by γH2AX induction in Western
blot and the intensity of γH2AX foci in cells (Figure 2A,
B, and C). 20µM cisplatin treatment further increases
γH2AX and the intensity of γH2AX, with HONE1 cells
showing much stronger intensity of γH2AX than HONE6
cells (Figure 2A, B, and C). To determine whether DNA
damage response plays a role in the cisplatin-resistant
phenotype of HONE6 cells, we monitored the kinetics of
γH2AX and the activation of CHK1, CHK2, and TP53
(p53) in response to cisplatin over time between HONE1
and HONE6 cells (Figure 2D). We found that the basal
level of γH2AX, phospho-CHK1 (S345), phospho-CHK2
(T68), and phospho-TP53 (S15) are higher in HONE6

RESULTS
Cisplatin-resistant HONE6 cells are resistant to
various DNA damaging agents
To determine whether enhanced DNA damage repair
may underlie the mechanism of cisplatin-resistance, we
chose to use the cisplatin-resistant NPC cell line, HONE6,
derived from a previously described NPC cell line,
HONE1 [45]. HONE6 cells were generated by chronic
treatment of HONE1 cells with low-dose cisplatin [46]. As
shown in Figure 1A, HONE6 cells are resistant to chronic
treatment of 5, 10, and 15 µM cisplatin, whereas HONE1
cells are sensitive to chronic treatment of cisplatin, with
5µM cisplatin being sufficient to kill all HONE1 cells.
To further explore the cisplatin-resistant phenotype
that is not specific to cisplatin, but a phenomenon specific
to DNA damage, we treated the cisplatin-resistant HONE6
cells with various DNA damaging agents, including
mitomycin C (MMC), methylmethane sulfonate (MMS),
and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO). The FA pathway
is involved in repairing the MMC-caused DNA damage,
whereas the TS pathway is involved in repairing MMSand 4NQO-caused DNA damage. Cell survival was
determined by the colony formation assay. HONE6 cells
are also resistant to these DNA damaging agents (Figure
1B), suggesting that the drug-resistant phenotype is
specific to DNA damage. In support of this notion, we
also found that HONE1 and HONE6 cells are equally
sensitive to paclitaxel (Taxol), a mitotic inhibitor used in
chemotherapy (Figure 1B). This result is also confirmed
by the cytotoxicity assay [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay] (Figure
1C). Paclitaxel is known to interfere with microtubule
breakdown during mitosis, thus arresting cells in the G2/M
phase and resulting in cell apoptosis. Therefore, our results
indicate that HONE6 cells may acquire an enhanced DNA
repair system related to the S phase progression.

at least three experiments. (B) HONE1 and HONE6 cells were

Cisplatin induces DNA damage both in cisplatin
sensitive HONE1 and resistant HONE6 cells
To determine whether cisplatin treatment induces
DNA damage both in cisplatin-sensitive HONE1 and
cisplatin-resistant HONE6 cells, we examined the level
of γH2AX by Western blotting and intensity of γH2AX
foci in cells. HONE1 and HONE6 cells were treated with
mock, 5µM, or 20µM cisplatin for four hours, followed
by Western blot and fluorescence microscopy analysis.

than in HONE1 cells (Figure 2A and D). However, 5µM
cisplatin induces much stronger intensity of γH2AX,
phospho-CHK1 (S345), phospho-CHK2 (T68), and
phospho-TP53 (S15) in HONE1 cells than in HONE6
cells. Importantly, the phospho-TP53 (S15) correlates
with apoptosis as judged by the cleavage form of caspase3
(Figure 2D). The intensity of γH2AX, phospho-CHK1
(S345), phospho-CHK2 (T68), and phospho-TP53 (S15)
is in a time- and dose-dependent manner both in HONE1
and HONE6 cells (Figure 2D). Our results indicate that
HONE6 acquires enhanced repair system to resolve stalled
forks caused by cisplatin. By contrast, HONE1 cells
encounter high frequency of stalled forks and collapse of
forks caused by cisplatin, thus resulting in dramatically
high activation of CHK1, CHK2, and TP53 and cell
apoptosis. However, high dose of cisplatin (20µM) could
also overwhelm the repair system in HONE6, causing
collapse of forks and cell apoptosis.

in HONE6 cells, as compared with in HONE1 cells, as
judged either by qRT-PCR or Western blotting (Figure 4).
Given that both the FA and TS pathways utilize HR
components to resolve stalled forks, we also checked the
expression of several genes in the FA and TS pathways.
The TS genes, including SHPRH, HLTF, and UBC13,
and the FA gene, including FANCB, FANCD2, FANCE,
FANCF, FANCI, FANCJ, FANCL, FANCM, and FANCN
have higher expression level in HONE6 cells than in
HONE1 cells (Figure 4A). Previous studies have shown
that monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI is
the key regulatory step in the FA pathway, and FANCL
and FANCI are sufficient for monoubiquitination of
FANCD2 in vitro [18, 47]. Our results show that these key
regulators, FANCD2, FANCI, and FANCL, are highly
expressed in HONE6 cells, suggesting these key regulators
of the FA pathway could play an important role in the
cisplatin-resistant phenotype of HONE6 cells.
Therefore, Consistent with the results of flow
cytometry and the phenotype of resistance to broad types
of DNA damaging agents, HONE6 cells may acquire the
enhanced HR in coordination with TS and FA to resolve
stalled forks caused by DNA damage.

The cisplatin-resistant HONE6 cells can progress
through the S phase in low-dose cisplatin
treatment
We further examined the cell cycle progression
in HONE1 and HONE6 cells in the presence of 5µM
and 20µM cisplatin treatments (Figure 3). HONE1
cells accumulate in the S phase in the presence of 5µM
cisplatin, with 58% of cells arrested in the S phase at 24
hours after treatment (Figure 3A). 20µM cisplatin strongly
arrests HONE1 cells in the G1 phase and 29% of HONE1
cells undergo apoptosis at 24 hours after treatment, as
judged by cells in the sub-G1 phase (Figure 3B). By
contrast, HONE6 cells can progress through the cell cycle
without arresting in the S phase in the presence of 5µM
cisplatin (Figure 3A). However, 20µM cisplatin treatment
arrests HONE6 cells in the S phase, with 31% of cells
accumulating in the S phase at 24 hours after treatment
(Figure 3B). Since FA and TS are two major pathways to
resolve stalled forks caused by DNA damage, and since
HR is essential for both of these pathways, it appears
that HONE6 cells may acquire enhanced HR, TS and FA
pathways. However, 20µM cisplatin treatment could result
in severe DNA lesions that overwhelm the HR, TS, and FA
pathways, resulting in the accumulation of HONE6 cells
in the S phase.

Cisplatin-resistant HONE6 cells show elevated
SCE frequency
To determine whether the enhanced HR in
coordination with TS and FA pathways are responsible
for the cisplatin-resistant phenotype, we performed a
sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis to determine
the HR efficiency (Figure 5). Strikingly, HONE6 cells
show elevated SCE frequency. More than 90% of HONE6
cells showed more than 10 SCE, whereas 78% of HONE1
cells showed less than 5 SCE (Figure 5A and C). These
results suggest that cisplatin-resistant HONE6 cells indeed
acquired the enhanced HR pathway.
To further verify our hypothesis, we depleted the
expression of the HR gene BRCA1, the TS gene UBC13,
or the FA gene FANCD2, by shRNA packed lentivirus
(Figure 6A and C). The scramble shRNA, shZ1339, was
used as the control. As shown in Figure 5B and C, SCE
frequency was dramatically reduced in the BRCA1-,
UBC13-, or FANCD2-depleted cells, suggesting that the
HR, TS, and FA pathways collaborate to contribute to
cisplatin resistant-phenotype in HONE6 cells.

Genes in the HR, TS, and FA pathways are highly
expressed in HONE6 cells

Depletion of HR, TS, or FA genes sensitizes
HONE6 cells to cisplatin

To determine whether HR is induced in HONE6
cells, we examined the expression levels of HR genes
in HONE6 cells by the quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western
blotting. Indeed, genes in the HR pathway, including
BRCA1, BARD1, and RAD51, are highly expressed

Given that the enhanced HR in coordination with
the TS and HR pathways underlies the cisplatin-resistant
phenotype, we reasoned that disruption of the HR, TS,
or FA pathway would sensitize cells to the cisplatin
treatment. Therefore, we depleted the expression of

TS genes, including HLTF, SHPRH, and UBC13, the
HR gene BRCA1, and the FA gene FANCD2, using the
shRNA packed lentivirus, as mentioned previously (Figure
6A, B, and C). These shRNA can efficiently deplete the
expression of HLTF, SHPRH, UBC13, BRCA1, and
FANCD2 (Figure 6A, B, and C). Interestingly, depletion
of HLTF also results in depletion of SHPRH (Figure 6B).
The control cells have 95% cell survival in 5µM cisplatin
and 90% cell survival in 10µM cisplatin (Figure 6D). By
contrast, the UBC13-, BRCA1-, or FANCD2-deficient

cells are dramatically sensitive to cisplatin, with 59%,
10%, and 68% cell survival rates in 5µM cisplatin, and
22%, 0%, and 17% cell survival rates in 10µM cisplatin,
respectively. Therefore, depletion of UBC13-, BRCA1-, or
FANCD2 greatly sensitizes HONE6 cells to cisplatin, but
the level of sensitivity does not reach to that of HONE1
cells, since 5µM cisplatin kills all HONE1 cells.
Depletion of SHPRH has no significant effect on the
viability of HONE6 cells in cisplatin relative to control
cells. This could be due to the functional redundancy of

SHPRH and HLTF. However, depletion of HLTF shows
decreasing viability in chronic treatment with 15 µM
of cisplatin (Figure 6D). By checking the expression of
SHPRH and HLTF in the HLTF-depleted cells, we found
that depletion of HLTF can simultaneously deplete the
expression of SHPRH (Figure 6B), resulting in more
sensitive to cisplatin than cells with silencing of SHPRH
only (Figure 6D). Our results thus provide evidence that
SHPRH and HLTF are functional redundant proteins.

5µM or 10µM cisplatin, and the cell cycle progression was
monitored at 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours during the chronic
treatment. As shown in Figure 7, the control cells can
progress through the cell cycle during chronic treatment
with cisplatin. However, the BRCA1-, FANCD2-, or
UBC13-deficient cells start to accumulate in the S phase
during chronic treatment with low-dose (5µM or 10µM)
cisplatin (Figure 7A), while the arrest in the S phase is
significantly increased in 10µM cisplatin treatment (Figure
7B). Therefore, the BRCA1-, FANCD2-, or UBC13deficient cells encounter obstacles to progressing through
the S phase during chronic treatment with low-dose
cisplatin, resulting in cell arrest in the S phase.
To determine whether more DSBs are generated in
cells due to the collapse of replication forks, we monitored
the induction of γH2AX in cells during chronic treatment
with low-dose cisplatin. Depletion of UBC13, BRCA1, or
FANCD2 dramatically increased the intensity of γH2AX
in terms of expression level and number of cells with
γH2AX foci during treatment with low-dose cisplatin
(Figure 8A, B, and C). Greater than 70% of these UBC13-

, BRCA1- or FANCD2-deficient cells exhibited strong
γH2AX intensity (>100 a.u.) in 5µM cisplatin and the
level of intensity was further enhanced in 10µM cisplatin
treatment, with more than 40% of cells showing greater
than 1000 a.u. fluorescent intensity of γH2AX (Figure
8B). The phospho-CHK1 and phospho-CHK2 is also
induced, suggesting that stalled forks and DSBs occur in
these cells (Figure 8A).
Consistent with the survival curve, depletion of
SHPRH or HLTF shows very similar γH2AX, phosphoCHK1, and phospho-CHK2 induction patterns to control
cells. Functional redundancy of SHPRH and HLTF, or
even the existence of additional E3 ligases might attribute
to the minor phenotypes of the SHPRH- or HLTF-depleted
cells.

resistant phenotype of cancer. In this study, we identified
a new DNA repair pathway, the TS pathway, in the
cisplatin-resistant phenotype of cancer. We demonstrated
that chronic treatment with low-dose cisplatin induces the
HR in coordination with the TS and FA pathways to confer
the drug-resistant phenotype of cancer. Most importantly,
the efficiency of resolving stalled forks caused by DNA
damage is essential to the cisplatin resistant phenotype.
In support of this notion, the cisplatin-resistant NPC
cells, HONE6 cells, show elevated SCE frequency when
compared to their cisplatin-sensitive precursors, HONE1
cells (Figure 5). Depletion of the HR gene BRCA1, the
TS gene UBC13, or the FA gene FANCD2, suppresses
SCE in HONE6 cells (Figure 5). In addition, these HR-,
TS- or FA-deficient HONE6 cells are sensitive to cisplatin
(Figure 6) and accumulate in the S phase in the presence of
low-dose cisplatin (Figure 7), concomitantly with elevated
γH2AX in cells (Figure 8). Our results suggest that HR,
in coordination with TS and FA components, participates
in fork progression, thus playing an important role in the
cisplatin-resistant phenotype of cancer.

DISCUSSION

chemotherapy. Previous studies have identified several
genes in the HR, nucleotide excision repair (NER), and
TLS pathways that play an important role in the drug-

Previous studies have extensively addressed the
importance of the FA pathway in resolving cisplatincaused DNA damage and the cisplatin-resistant phenotype.
However, the information regarding the function and
significance of the TS pathway in the drug-resistant
phenotype remains elusive. In particular, what is the
outcome of chronic treatment with low-dose cisplatin?
Here, we discovered that chronic treatment with low-dose
cisplatin induces the TS pathway in addition to the HR
and FA pathways. Interestingly, a recent discovery also
demonstrated the importance of the TS pathway during
chronic low-dose of UV irradiation (CLUV) in yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae [48]. In addition to the TS
gene, the HR proteins RAD51, RAD52, and RAD54 are
critical for recovery from CLUV irradiation in yeast [48].
We provide several lines of evidence that the TS pathway
is particularly important to survival during chronic
treatment with low-dose cisplatin in human cells and that
HR components are also involved in the TS pathway.
First, chronic treatment with low-dose cisplatin induces
the expression of TS and HR genes to confer cisplatin
resistance. Second, consistent with high expression of TS
and HR genes, these cisplatin-resistant HONE6 cells can
progress through the S phase in chronic treatment with
low-dose cisplatin and exhibit elevated SCE frequency.
Third, depletion of TS or HR genes sensitizes HONE6
cells to cisplatin and accumulates cells in the S phase in the
presence of low-dose cisplatin. Fourth, these TS- or HRdeficient cells exhibit high levels of DSBs, as judged by
the elevated γH2AX in these cells. Indeed, the TS pathway

involves the strand invasion of a nascent strand into the
undamaged sister chromatid, a process that generates a
double Holliday junction [17, 33, 39]. Recently, HLTF
has been shown to be involved in the strand invasion
mechanism that can promote gap filling during replication
of damaged DNA [40]. Therefore, HR proteins would
be involved in resolving the Holliday junction and result
in SCE. In support of this notion, we also found that a
high SCE frequency occurs in HONE6 cells. Importantly,
depletion of UBC13 or BRCA1 dramatically reduces SCE
in HONE6 cells. Recent studies also support this notion.
Several HR proteins, such as RAD51, MRE11, BRCA1,
and BRCA2, are involved in resolving stalled forks [4144].
Interestingly, depletion of either SHPRH or HLTF
did not result in severe phenotype as much as depletion of
UBC13. Functional redundancy of SHPRH and HLTF, or
even the existence of additional E3 ligases could account
for the discrepancy. Given the large size of human genome,
functional redundancy might have evolved to ensure the
successful completion of DNA replication in the presence
of low levels of DNA damage. For example, there is only
one E3 ligase, Rad5, in the TS pathway in yeast, whereas
at least two orthologs of Rad5, SHPRH and HLTF, are
evolved in human cells [38]. A recent study even suggests
that additional E3 ligases might exist in the TS pathway
in mammalian cells [24]. In addition, previous studies
have shown that the E3 ligases, RNF8 and RNF168, can
also interact with UBC13. The interaction between RNF8,
RNF168, and UBC13 generates K63-linked polyubiquitin
chains at H2A or γH2AX, which in turn recruit BRCA1
to sites of DNA damage [49-52]. Therefore, silencing
of UBC13 can affect more biological pathways than
silencing of HLTF and SHPRH, which could account for
the reason why silencing of UBC13 results in more severe
phenotype than silencing of SHPRH and HLTF. As to
whether RNF8 and RNF168 can also ubiquitinate PCNA,
and whether RNF8 and RNF168 could be the missing E3
ligases in the TS pathway, further studies to generate the
triple or quadruple knockout of SHPRH, HLTF, RNF8,
and RNF168 might answer this question.
To determine whether DNA damage checkpoint
plays a role in cisplatin-resistant phenotype of HONE6
cells, we monitored the kinetics of γH2AX, phosphoCHK1 (S345), phospho-CHK2 (T68), and phospho-TP53
(S15) in response to cisplatin over time in HONE1 and
HONE6 cells (Figure 2D). Our results demonstrate that
both HONE1 and HONE6 are not checkpoint-defective.
Interestingly, we found that the basal level of γH2AX,
phospho-CHK1 (S345), phospho-CHK2 (T68), and
phospho-TP53 (S15) are higher in HONE6 than in HONE1
cells (Figure 2A and D). It could be due to the elevated
SCE (because DSBs occur to initiate SCE). However,
cisplatin-sensitive HONE1 cells respond to cisplatin more
vigorously than cisplatin-resistant HONE6 cells, which
shows much stronger intensity of γH2AX, phospho-CHK1

Figure 7: BRCA1-, FANCD2-, and UBC13-deficient
cells accumulate in the S phase in the presence of
10µM cisplatin treatment. Fractions of the S phase cells
were determined by flow cytometry of HONE1 and HONE6
cells in the presence of 5µM (A) or 10µM (B) of cisplatin. Cells
were chronically treated with cisplatin for 24 hours.

(S345), phospho-CHK2 (T68), and phospho-TP53 (S15)
in HONE1 cells than in HONE6 cells. Our results support
the notion that cisplatin-sensitive HONE1 cells encounter
high frequency of stalled forks and collapse of forks
caused by cisplatin, thus resulting in dramatically high
activation of CHK1, CHK2, and TP53 and cell apoptosis.
By contrast, HONE6 acquires enhanced repair system to
resolve stalled forks caused by cisplatin, thus resulting in
less activation of DNA damage response.
As to what is the suspected mechanism for the
induction of these FA, TS, and HR genes in HONE6 cells?
FOXM1 (forkhead box protein M1) is a transcription
factor and has been shown to associate with cisplatinresistance and DNA damage response in breast cancer
[53-58]. We discovered that the expression level of
FOXM1 is slightly increased in HONE6 cells compared
to HONE1 cells, as judged by qRT-PCR and Western
blotting (Figure S3). Therefore, FOXM1 could underlie
the induction mechanism that induces FA, TS, and HR
genes. As several other transcription factors, such as E2F,
NF-kB, TIP60, Nrf2, GCF2, are also indicated in the
cisplatin-resistant phenotype [59]. We cannot rule out the
possibility that these transcription factors are also involved
in the induction mechanism. Further investigation will be
worthy of exploration to determine the mechanism.
In this study, we discovered that HR, in coordination
with the TS and FA pathways, plays a central role in the
cisplatin-resistant phenotype of cancer. Targeting these
three pathways may thus provide a therapeutic strategy
for treating cisplatin-resistant cancer.

Cytotoxicity
was
determined
by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. 105 cells were grown in culture
plates for 24 hours and then treated with various
concentrations of drugs for another 72 hours. 0.5 mg/ml
MTT was added to each culture, followed by incubation
at 37oC for 4 hours. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was
added to dissolve the converted dye of the released MTT.
Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm
using a microplate reader. Cytotoxicity induced by each
treatment was calculated as the percentage of viable cells
by dividing the optical density of samples in drug-treated
wells by that of the control wells.

qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA from HONE1, HONE6, or genedepleted HONE6 cells was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) and was subjected to reverse transcription
using GoScriptTM reverse transcription system (Promega).
The resulting cDNA samples were analyzed using the realtime PCR analysis (ABI StepOne PlusTM Real-Time PCR
Systems). The real-time PCR was performed in a 40µl
reaction with 0.8µl of 10µM primers, 0.8µl of 50mM

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The nasopharyngeal carcinoma HONE1 cells
were gifts from the distinguished investigator JangYang Chang (NHRI, Taiwan) and were cultured in
RPMI1640 supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% glutamine,
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin [45, 46]. HONE6 cells
were developed through chronic low-dose treatment of
HONE1 using cisplatin containing medium (RPMI1640
supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, and increasing dose to 5µM cisplatin) [46].

Colony formation assay
Approximately 104 cells were seeded in 100-mm
dishes in duplicate. Subsequently, cells were chronically
treated with cisplatin, MMC, MMS, and 4NQO, and
incubated for 10 days. The resulting colonies were stained
with 1% crystal violet (Sigma). Colonies were counted
using a GeneTools software program (Syngene).

HONE1 or HONE6 was normalized by the level of ACTB
in each cell.

5278, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Caspase 3 (9662,
Cell Signaling Technology), and FOXM1 (sc-500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). All images were acquired by the
GeneGnome 5 (Bio Image, Syngene) and the γH2AX/
H2AX, p-CHK1/CHK1, and p-CHK2/CHK2 ratios were
quantitative by a GeneTools software program (Syngene).
These data were repeated at least three times and similar
trends were observed.

Sister chromatid exchange (SCE)
106 cells were incubated with 9μg/mL
5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma) for 48 hours, and
SCE analysis was performed as described previously.
Images were acquired by Nikon eclipse 80i / NIS Elements
D4.20.00. For each cell line, 50 metaphases were analyzed
to determine the SCE frequency.

shRNA lentiviral gene knockdown
HEK293T was used as packaging cells to generate
shRNA encoding lentiviruses. Cells infected with
lentiviruses were selected in 2μg/ml puromycin. All
RNAi reagents were obtained from the National RNAi
Core Facility, Academia Sinica. Sequences targeted by
shRNAs were as follows: shZ1339 : CGC GAT CGT AAT
CAC CCG AGT (TRCN0000244984) ; shBRCA1 : GAG

; shSHPRH : ACG GAA CCA GAA GCG CTA TAT
(TRCN0000235922). Depletion of genes was verified by
qRT-PCR and Western blotting.

Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells plated on two-well chamber slides were
chronically treated with 5 µM, 10µM, or 20µM
cisplatin for 4 or 24 hours and then fixed with 3.5%
paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with
1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Fixed cells were blocked
with 5% FBS and stained with anti-γH2AX and Alexaconjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Images were
acquired by confocal microscope OLYMPUS IX81. The
fluorescence intensity of γH2AX in a cell was quantified
by an OLYMPUS FLUOVIEW: FV10-ASW software. At
least 100 cells from each cell lines were quantified.

Flow cytometry

Conflict of interest

Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in ice-cold
70% ethanol overnight. Fixed cells were then treated
with RNase at 37oC for 30 min. After incubation with
propidium iodide solution (Invitrogen), cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry (Cell Lab Quanta™ SC Flow
Cytometer, Beckman Coulter).

The authors declare no conflict of interest.
