ABSTRACT
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) typically arises from skeletal muscle. Currently, RMS
in patients with recurrent and metastatic disease have no successful treatment. The
molecular pathogenesis of RMS varies based on cancer sub-types. Some embryonal
RMS but not other sub-types are driven by sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway.
However, Shh pathway inhibitors particularly smoothened inhibitors are not highly
effective in animals. Here, we show that Shh pathway effectors GLI1 and/or GLI2
are over-expressed in the majority of RMS cells and that GANT-61, a specific
GLI1/2 inhibitor dampens the proliferation of both embryonal and alveolar RMS
cells-derived xenograft tumors thereby blocking their growth. As compared to
vehicle-treated control, about 50% tumor growth inhibition occurs in mice receiving
GANT-61 treatment. The proliferation inhibition was associated with slowing of cell
cycle progression which was mediated by the reduced expression of cyclins D1/2/3
& E and the concomitant induction of p21. GANT-61 not only reduced expression
of GLI1/2 in these RMS but also significantly diminished AKT/mTOR signaling.
The therapeutic action of GANT-61 was significantly augmented when combined
with chemotherapeutic agents employed for RMS therapy such as temsirolimus or
vincristine. Finally, reduced expression of proteins driving epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT) characterized the residual tumors.

in genetic, morphologic and therapeutic responses indicate
that each RMS sub-type is a distinct entity [6]. aRMS is
associated with recurrent chromosomal translocations.
The translocation t(2;13)(q35;q14) leading to the PAX3FOXO1 (P3F) gene fusion occurs in 55% of aRMS, the
translocation t(1;13)(q36;q14) leading to the PAX7FOXO1 gene fusion are present in 22% of cases, and
remaining 23% are fusion-negative [5]. eRMS has not
been associated with a recurrent diagnostic genetic
alteration, although loss of heterozygosity at 11p15 is
known to occur [7, 8]. However, sonic hedgehog (Shh)
signaling is considered to be an important driver of about
half of eRMS [9], particularly, the eRMS that develop

INTRODUCTION
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common
soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood [1, 2]. Based on distinct
histological features, RMS are categorized into two major
subtypes: embryonal (e)RMS and alveolar (a)RMS [3].
The incidence of eRMS (approximately 75% of the total
cases) is highest in children aged younger than 5 years,
whereas incidence of aRMS (approximately 16% of cases)
does not vary significantly with age [4, 5]. The survival
rates for aRMS and eRMS patients with metastatic and/
or advanced disease are remarkably low [3]. Despite
possibly a common mesenchymal origin, the differences

in patients with Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome or Gorlin
Syndrome [10].
Current therapeutic approaches have not resulted
in significant improvement in outcome for patients with
recurrent and/or metastatic disease. These patients still
face a grim prognosis and better treatment approaches
are desperately needed [11–13]. Existing treatment for
RMS includes multi-agent chemotherapy, radiation
therapy and surgical resection [14]. Introduced decades
ago, the combination of vincristine, dactinomycin and
cyclophosphamide (VAC) is still generally considered
the standard of care for RMS [15]. For patients with
very high risk disease, in particular those with metastasis
at three or more sites, the outcome remain dismal with
less than 20% of patients surviving [3, 16]. Intensifying
chemotherapy in these patients has also not resulted in an
improved outcome [17]. Thus, studies exploring the role of
molecular target-based inhibitors may find more effective
therapies, either as single agents or when combined with
conventional chemotherapy backbones. Recent advances
in the understanding of molecular alterations occurring
in refractory and metastatic RMS provide opportunities
to test novel therapeutic options [18–20]. In this regards,
dysregulation in RAS pathway, insulin-like growth
factor (IGF), hedgehog (Hh), p53 and AKT/mTOR
signaling which have been shown to be associated with
the pathobiology of RMS [21–26], may be categorized
as novel targets. Earlier, we showed that augmenting
p53-dependent apoptosis regulatory signaling may be
effective in killing rhabdoid cells [21].
The Hh signaling, a fundamental signal transduction
pathway comprises the interaction of the ligands Hh such
as Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Desert hedgehog (Dhh) or Indian
hedgehog (Ihh) with the receptor protein Patched (Ptch),
that leads to the repression of another membrane-associated
protein smoothened (SMO). This results in the activation of
downstream effector transcription factors known as GLIs.
Among them, GLI1 and GLI2 are activator and GLI3 is
a repressor of the pathway [27]. In addition, under noncanonical settings, sustained activation of GLI1/2 is known
to occur leading to oncogenic consequences involving
dysregulation of cell cycle progression and proliferation
[28]. Targeting these effector molecules may have some
cancer modulating effects not only in RMS but also in other
neoplasm [29–32].
In this study, we found that GLI1/2 expression is
high in cells derived from both RMS sub-types, which
prompted us to test whether these transcription factors
are involved in disease progression of both alveolar and
embryonal sub-types and blocking these targets may
attenuate the neoplastic growth. The published data
remain insufficient to address this question [23]. Our data
show that targeted inhibitions of GLI1/2 by their known
inhibitor GANT-61 results in the effective blockade of
proliferation and promotes death of RD and RH30 cells
derived from the two human RMS sub-types. The growth
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reduction in the aRMS and eRMS xenograft tumors by
GANT-61 was similar. GANT-61 treatment reduced
the progression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
Mechanism by which GANT-61 affects EMT progression
involved reduction of the effector proteins in both Shh
and AKT/m-TOR signaling pathways. We also found
similar results in xenograft tumors developed by poorly
differentiated rhabdoid A2O4 cells which also manifested
increased expression of GLI1. Rhabdoid tumors are
highly aggressive early childhood neoplasm with limited
therapeutic options. Additional novel observation in this
study is the demonstration that the effects of GANT-61 are
significantly augmented by the combinatorial treatment
with mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus (Torisel) or rapamycin
(RAPA) or mitotic inhibitor vincristine (VCR).

RESULTS
GANT-61 treatment inhibits human RMS
tumor growth
Both RD and RH30 cells following inoculation
in nude mice form stable xenograft tumors. Animals
receiving each cell-type were divided into two groups
(n = 5, each group). Control mice group received an
i.p. injection of vehicle, whereas experimental group of
mice received i.p injections of GANT-61 (50mg/kg, body
weight in 200μl PBS; three times a week). Dose selection
for GANT-61 was made according to a previously
published study [33]. Treatment of nude mice bearing
RMS with GANT-61 reduced tumor growth significantly.
The differences in the growth of tumors in vehicle- and
GANT-61-treated groups were apparent beginning from
the week second of tumor cell inoculation. At later
time-points these differences in the tumor growth were
more prominent and significant (*p < 0.05). GANT-61
inhibits the growth of both of these tumor sub-types
with almost same efficiency. At the termination of the
experiment, inhibition was about 53% in RD cells derived
tumors (Fig. 1AI) and 47% in RH30 cells tumors (Fig.
1BI). The changes in tumor cells morphology following
GANT-61 treatment was studied using hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E). The histology of these tumors is shown in
fig.  1A-II and 1B-II. As compared to vehicle-treated
controls, GANT-61-treated residual RD cell xenograft
tumors showed prominent necrosis while, RH30 cellsderived tumors were more differentiated.

GANT-61 treatment inhibits proliferation and
induced apoptosis in human RMS xenograft
tumors
First, we determined the biomarkers depicting
proliferation and apoptosis in these tumors to investigate
whether GANT-61 promotes inhibition of proliferation or/
and induces apoptosis. Real time PCR analysis showed

significant reduction in the expression levels of mRNA of
proliferation-related cyclin D1/2 and E1 (Fig 2A). These
data were supported by the immunofluorescence staining
of RD cells-derived xenograft tumors section (Fig. 2B).
GANT-61-treatment to mice bearing RMS xenograft
significantly reduced the percentage of cells positive for
PCNA (p = 0.0001), cyclinD1 (p = 0.0005) and cyclinE1
(p = 0.0006) staining as compared to vehicle-treated tumors
(Fig. 2B-I) as also expressed as % positive cells in the
histograms (Fig. 2B-II). Western blot analysis also showed
similar results (Fig. 2C & 2D). Densitometric analysis of
band intensity expressed as fold change showed significant
differences in the expression of these proteins when
compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2C-II & 2D-II).
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that unlike
vehicle-treated RH30 xenograft tumors, which have an
intense wide-spread nuclear staining of PCNA, only a
few cells were positive for PCNA in GANT-61 treated
group (Fig. 2E-I & II). GANT-61 treatment augmented

apoptosis in both of these tumor-types as inferred from the
presence of multiple TUNEL-positive cells in the residual
tumors from GANT-61-treated animals (data not shown).
Consistently, enhanced cleaved caspase-3 expression was
detected in the WB analysis of tissue lysates from both
RD and RH30 cells-derived tumors (Fig. 2C & 2D). These
data suggest that GANT-61 acts by blocking proliferation
and by inducing apoptosis.

GANT-61 inhibits cell cycle proteins, reduces
colony formation and induces apoptosis in RMS
cells in vitro
To confirm the in vivo results and to provide a firm
basis to the mechanistic insight, we explored the effects
of GANT-61 on cell cycle progression, colony formation
and apoptosis in in vitro assays using these RMS cells
in culture. MTT assay using various concentrations
(0.5–250 μM) of GANT-61 was conducted to determine

of Gli1/2, Ptch-1/2 and Akt-1, we selected RH30 and
RD cells which represent respectively aRMS and
eRMS for further in-depth studies. It is known that
the activation of GLIs occurs through canonical as
well as non-canonical Shh signaling pathways [35]. In
addition, crosstalk between Shh and Akt/mTOR pathway
has also been described [18]. Here, we found that
GANT-61 treatment not only decreased the expression
of Glis but also diminished the expression of proteins in
the mTOR signaling pathway as ascertained at by mRNA
expression, western blot and immunofluorescence
staining both in vitro in cells in culture and in vivo in
xenograft tumors (Fig 4 and Supplementary Fig. S3).
Interestingly, reduced phosphorylation of AKT at both
Thr308 and Ser473 in GANT-61-treated RD and RH30
cells was observed while no significant change in the
total AKT levels was noticed (Fig. 4F). These changes
in GANT-61-treated RMS cells accompanied a decrease
in cyclin D1 (Fig. 2).

suitable concentration range of GANT-61 for further
studies. Based on these results, we selected a concentration
range of 5 to 25 μM to investigate its anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptosis effects. GANT-61 treatment to RMS cells
exhibited anti-proliferative effects and induced cell death
in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
GANT-61-treated cells were morphologically distinct
from vehicle-treated cells. The morphological alterations
in these cells included cell rounding, loss of cell adhesion,
contraction of cytoplasmic membrane and blebbing
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Reverse transcriptase PCR
analysis showed that treatment of RMS cells in culture
with GANT-61 reduced expression of cyclins D1/2/3
and E. In addition to the reduction in the transcript levels
of these genes, a similar decrease in the protein level of
cyclin D1 was also observed both in GANT-61-treated
RD and RH30 cells (Fig 3B & 3C). We also performed
flow cytometry analysis to complement the observed
effects of GANT-61 on cell cycle progression. GANT61 treatment arrested these cells mainly in G0/G1 phase
(Fig. 3D). With increasing concentrations GANT-61,
significant increases in the proportion of cells in G0/G1
phase were recorded. Similar concentration-dependent
effects were noticed in sub-G0 population. Moreover,
lower concentrations of GANT-61 also manifested
similar increases in dead cells but at later time-points
of 48 and 72 h of GANT-61 treatment (data not shown).
Consistent with the enhancement in sub-G0 populations,
increase in cleaved caspase-3 in GANT-61-treated RD and
RH30 cells occurred dose-dependently (Fig 3B & 3C).
The G0/G1 arrest was correlated with the appearance
of cell cycle inhibitory protein, p21 which is also known
as CDK-interacting protein 1 (CIP1). It was found to be
induced dose-dependently following GANT-61 treatment
(Fig. 3E). This was further confirmed in colony formation/
clonogenic assay, where GANT-61 reduced the number of
colonies in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3F-I & II).

GANT-61 treatment inhibits epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT)
Earlier, we have shown the combined role of Shh
and Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in EMT regulation
[25]. These signaling pathways are also known to
regulate EMT in various cancer-types [36, 37]. Since
we observed here that GANT-61 affects the expression
of proteins in both of these pathways, we tested whether
GANT-61 treatment could modulate the expression
of proteins that regulate EMT. Immunofluorescence
analysis showed that expression of the epithelial
biomarker, E-cadherin was increased whereas
mesenchymal biomarkers such as Fibronectin and
Snail were decreased following GANT-61 treatment in
both RD and RH30 cells-derived xenograft tumors as
shown in fig 5A & 5B. The transcription factors Twist
and Slug, which are known EMT regulators, were
reduced in GANT-61-treated tumors (Fig. 5A & 5B).
Similar conclusion could be drawn based on western
blot analysis. Data shown as histogram represents the
dentiometric analysis of western blot (Fig. 5C).

GANT-61-treated tumors show reduced
expression of Shh and mTOR signaling related
proteins
The pathogenesis of RMS is known to involve
Shh and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways [22, 25, 34].
However, it remains unclear whether inhibitors of these
targets effectively diminish this neoplasm. Here, first we
analyzed the expression of Shh pathway genes in both
eRMS (RD, SMS-CTR) and aRMS (RH30, CW0919)
cells in addition to poorly differentiated A204 rhabdoid
cells in comparison to normal human smooth muscle
(HA-VSMC) cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Based
on real time PCR data, we inferred that as compared
to HA-VSMC cells the expression of Gli1 and Ptch1 was elevated at least by 2 fold in cells representing
both RMS sub-types. Based on the relative expression

Next, we examined whether blocking GLI1/2 by
GANT-61 sensitizes RMS cells to mTOR inhibitors and
effectively diminish their survival. These studies are of
potential importance for developing novel combinatorial
approaches for killing refractory RMS and also for
the dose reduction of highly toxic chemotherapeutics
agents which are not well-tolerated in certain individual
[38]. Temsirolimus and rapamycin are known mTOR
inhibitors and vincristine is a mitotic inhibitor. These

to single arm treatments (Fig. 6 A & 6B). Vincristine,
another important chemotherapeutic drug frequently
used for the treatment of RMS showed similar results
against both RMS sub-types when compared with
GANT-61 alone single arm treatment (Fig 6A & 6B).
In these studies, we observed frequent alterations in
cell morphology which was followed by cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

earlier reports show that GANT-61 inhibits the growth of
eRMS both in vitro and in xenograft model [9, 23] but
these studies are largely descriptive and failed to provide
a clear mechanistic basis for implicating GLIs as potent
therapeutic target for RMS in general. Thus, particularly
its effects remain largely undefined for aRMS. Recently
Agyeman et al. demonstrated that by binding to the 5-zinc
finger GLI1 protein at sites E119 and E167 in zinc fingers
2 and 3 GANT-61 inhibits GLI1 [46]. However, it is not
clear whether similar mechanism underlie GLI2 inhibition.
Results in this study demonstrated that the mechanism
underlying inhibition in proliferation of both of these
tumor cells is largely dependent on the ability of GANT61 to slow down the cell cycle progression by arresting
both aRMS and eRMS in G0/G1 phase. We also observed
that this cell cycle arrest could be related to the GANT-61mediated reduction in the expression of cyclin Ds which
are known driver of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase.
The additional observations in this study that GANT-61
mediates induction of cell cycle inhibitory protein p21
which binds to cyclin Ds/CDks and cyclin E/cdk2 protein
kinase complexes to block their kinase activity provides
strength to the notion that GANT-61 targets cell cycle
regulatory proteins assembly. These data demonstrate that
consequences of targeting GLIs on the growth inhibition
of both major RMS sub-types could be mediated via
slowing down the cell cycle progression.
Since, we found in this study almost equal
effectiveness of GANT-61 against these two RMS subtypes, we conducted an additional experiment to assess
whether GLIs may alter the growth of rhabdoid tumors
as well. Rhabdoid cancer is rare lethal early childhood
cancer [47]. A2O4 which earlier classified as RMS cells
later showed to carry a SMARCB1 (SNF5) mutation
and possess other characteristics of rhabdoid neoplasm
[42, 48]. In this regard, we utilized A204 cells-derived
xenograft tumor as model of rhabdoid tumors [21] and
treated them with forskolin. Forskolin, is a known inducer
of PKA, a kinase which by phosphorylating GLIs and
promotes their degradation [49]. The reduced tumor
growth associated with the inhibition of GLI by forskolin
(Supplementary Fig. S5) suggests that GLIs are important
therapeutic target for a wide variety of RMS sub-types
irrespective of their genotype or differentiation states.
Another important finding in this manuscript is that
GANT-61 by inhibiting GLIs alters the tumor phenotype
which is reflected by the reduction in the expression of
mesenchymal marker proteins with the concomitant
enhancement in epithelial polarity marker protein. These
data suggest that GANT-61 by inhibiting Shh signaling
effector transcription factor could reduce EMT and
consequently RMS tumor cells become less aggressive
and invasive. These results are also consistent with
the remarkable reduction in the proliferative potential
of these cells as assessed by colony formation assay.

DISCUSSION
At the time of diagnosis, RMS is clinically
characterized as intermediate and high risk in 68% of cases
and being metastatic in 16% cases [41]. A poor prognosis
is known to be associated with fusion gene-negative
aRMS and eRMS showing activation of the Hh signaling
pathway [34]. Since, GLIs are the effector molecules
of Shh signaling pathway, we utilized various cell lines
derived from RMS patients to investigate whether
expression of Gli1 mRNA or protein or both are enhanced.
The high expression of GLIs may also have severe
consequences not only in terms of RMS pathogenesis
but also in attaining resistance to certain therapeutic
modalities. Among the cell lines utilized in this study, RD
was derived from the pelvic RMS developed in 7 year
old female child who was treated with cyclophosphamide
and radiation and found to have refractory diseases. The
histologic appearances of tumor biopsies conferred an
eRMS [42]. RH30, the other cell line in this study was
derived from the bone marrow of a 16 year old male with
untreated metastatic aRMS [42]. The observations in
this study that enhanced expression of Gli1 and/or Gli2
occurs in these RMS cells provide a tempting scenario
to investigate the role of Gli1/2 as molecular target for
blocking pathogenesis of these deadly children’s cancers
since it is known that high expression of GLIs may also
have severe consequences in attaining resistance to
certain therapeutic modalities. After both in vitro and in
vivo confirmation that RD and RH30 cells carry elevated
Gli1 and Gli2 mRNA expression, we employed them to
test the hypothesis that blocking Glis may provide an
advantage in reducing growth of these tumors and that
the residual tumors in the drug-treatment group might
manifest a less invasive phenotype. This hypothesis
was based on the fact that Hh signaling is known to be
involved in augmenting EMT [25, 43, 44] and facilitates
the development of an aggressive and invasive tumor
phenotype in certain tumor models [36, 45]. Consistent
with earlier published observations [18], we found that
both RD and RH30 cells form stable xenograft tumors
when subcutaneously injected to nude mouse. Indeed,
our results demonstrated that GANT-61 dampens the
proliferation signals in xenograft tumors derived from both
of these cell lines. Its prolonged treatment reduces tumor
growth in the GLI-inhibition-dependent manner. Although,

Interestingly,  forskolin-mediated modulation of GLI
expression in rhabdoid A204 xenograft tumors was also
associated with the reduction in EMT-related proteins
further suggesting that the expression of GLIs may be
associated with aggressive and invasive tumor phenotype.
The molecular mechanism of EMT modulating
effects of GANT-61 seems to be mediated via downregulation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. The
dramatic decrease in p-AKT and p-P70S6k levels in
GANT-61-treated RMS cells and tumors as observed here
might play an important role in altering the metabolismdependent phenotype of these tumors. The mechanism by
which GANT-61 alters AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
is not clearly understood at this time. Further in-depth
studies are required to embark on the role of these
pathways in abolishing drug resistance in recurrent and
refractory RMS. However, the crosstalk between Shh and
mTOR pathways is known to exist in other cancers [35].
Interestingly, earlier we also showed that treatment with
rapamycin of A204 cells-derived xenograft tumors not
only reduced mTOR signaling pathway but also reduced
expression of GLIs suggesting an existence of possible
crosstalk between the two pathways [21]. Our data that
treatment of RD and RH30 cells with chemotherapeutic
drug vincristine and mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and
rapamycin augments the ability of GANT-61 for enhanced
killing of these tumor cells supports this notion.
In summary, these data provide evidence that
targeting GLIs in various RMS sub-types may be
successful in the management of relapsed and refractory
RMS. These data also provide some evidence that GLIs
play a role in developing an aggressive and invasive tumor
phenotype. In this regard, a nexus between GLIs and AKT/
mTOR might play a critical role. The remarkable efficacy
of GANT-61 in combination with other chemotherapeutic
drugs also point to the utility of this molecular target in

speculate that GLIs may provide important therapeutic

atmosphere of 5% CO2. HA-VSMC were grown in F-12K
medium supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 0.01
mg/ml insulin, 0.01 mg/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml sodium
selenite, 0.03 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement
(ECGS); fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of
10%, HEPES to a final concentration of 10 mM, TES to
a final concentration of 10 mM. GANT-61 was purchased
from Cayman (MI, USA). Rapamycin was purchased from
Fujian Kerui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Fuzhou, Fujian,
China). Temsirolimus and vincristine were obtained from
Pfizer (NY, USA) and Hospira (IL, USA) respectively.
Primers used in this study were obtained from Invitrogen
(Supplementary Table S1-I and II). Primary antibodies
were purchased as described in supplementary table S2.
Various treatments of these cells were performed when their
confluence reached to about 70–80%.

Tumor xenograft study
Female mice (athymic nu/nu, 3–5 weeks, 25–30g)
were purchased from NCI-Frederick Animal Production
Program (Frederick, MD, USA). All animal procedures
were performed according to guidelines and approvals
of the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Alabama at Birmingham (IACUC). For this
study, RD and RH30 cells were detached by trypsinization,
washed, and re-suspended in cold PBS. Animals were
administrated 2.5 × 106 RD or RH30 cells/200 μL PBS
subcutaneously in each rear flank after that animals
receiving each cell-type were divided into two groups
(n = 5, each group). This experiment was continued until
tumor size in control group exceeded 1cm2. At this time,
both the vehicle-treated and the GANT61-treated groups
were euthanized. GANT-61 stock solution was made in
100% ethanol and diluted in PBS. Tumors were measured
by digital calibers and tumor volumes calculated using
the formula volume = length × width × height plotted as
a function of days on test. The subcutaneous tumor was
removed and divided into two pieces, one of which was
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the other was fixed in
10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
Cell culture and reagents

Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed
exactly as described in our previously published study
[50]. Briefly, tumors were fixed in 10% buffered formalin
and embedded in paraffin. Tumor tissues were cut into
sections (5 μm) using microtome (HM 325, Thermo
scientific, MA, USA). Sections were deparaffinized in
xylene and rehydrated. Tumor sections from each group
were stained with H&E and examined for tumor histology
under various magnifications using Olympus BX51 with
Olympus DP71 digital camera.

Normal human smooth muscle (HA-VSMC), RMS
(RH30, aRMS), (RD, eRMS) and rhabdoid cell line
(A204) cells were procured from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). While (CW9019, aRMS) and (SMSCTR, eRMS) cells were gifted to JGP by Dr. Frederic
G. Barr, Deputy Branch Chief and Senior Investigator
Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute,
USA. RMS cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml of penicillin,

Na3VO4, 10mmol/L DTT and protease inhibitor)
followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 minute
to obtain a clear supernatant. Protein assay was done
using a DC kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Lysate were
mixed with 5X sample buffer (312.5 mM Tris-HCL,
PH-6.8, 5%β-mercaptoethenol, 10% SDS, 0.5%
bromophenol blue, 50% glycerol), boiled for 5 minute
at 95°C and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were
electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane and then nonspecific site were
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris buffer
saline tween-20 (TBST) (25 mmol/L Tris-HCL,
PH-7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h
at room temperature followed by probing with primary
antibody overnight at 4°C or 2 h at room temperature.
After washing, the membranes were incubated for
1.5 h with respective (anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or antigoat immunoglobulin) HRP conjugated secondary
antibody. The blots were developed with enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Amersham Bioscience).

Immunohistochemical (IHC)/
Immunofluorescence (IF) staining
For immunohistochemical staining, sections
were de-paraffinized following rehydration and then
incubated in antigen unmasking solution according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Vector laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA). To avoid nonspecific binding
of antibodies, a blocking buffer of 2% BSA in PBS
for 30 min at 37°C was used and then these sections
were incubated with primary antibodies followed by a
universal peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and
visualized with DAB substrate. For immunofluorescence
staining, tissue sections were incubated with
fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h
at room temperature and  rinsed with PBS. Sections
were mounted with DAPI and visualized under 40X
magnification using Olympus BX51 with Olympus DP71
digital camera.

RNA isolation and reverse transcriptase PCR
RNA isolation and reverse transcriptase PCR
analysis was performed as described previously [51].
Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol
method (Invitrogen, CA, USA). mRNA (1 μg) was
reverse-transcribed into cDNA by iScript cDNA synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). PCR products were run on 1.5%
agarose gels and the relative quantification was done
using Gel Documentation System (Bio-Rad laboratories,
Segrate, Italy). GAPDH was used as an internal control.

MTT assay
Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2-5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as
described earlier [50]. Briefly, 10,000 cells per well were
seeded into 96-well micro-culture plates at 37°C with 5%
CO2 and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were treated
with designated doses of GANT-61 and rapamycin for 24
h and incubated with MTT at final concentration 0.5 mg/
ml for 4 h before the completion of exposure time at 37°C.
Formation of MTT to formazon crystals by viable cells was
assessed using 200 μL/well DMSO at room temperature
for 15 min. Optical density was measured at 490 nm using
micro-plate reader model 680 (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The
reduction in viability of cells in each well was expressed as
the percentage of control cells.

Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR)
qRT-PCR analysis was performed using either
SYBR green (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) fluorescent dye or
TaqMan (Applied Biosystem, CA, USA) PCR master mix
[51]. qRT-PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate
using 7500 fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystem, CA, USA). Cycling conditions were 20s
at 95°C followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 3s and 60°C
for 30s. Relative quantification of the steady state target
mRNA levels was done after normalization of total amount
of cDNA to GAPDH internal reference. Real time PCR
primers employed in this study are listed in Supplementary
Table S1-II.

Morphological alterations
Morphological changes were assessed in cultured
cells treated with various treatment groups. Phenotypic
alterations such as cell roundness, shrinkage, blebbing
etc. were recorded by the phase contrast microscopy
(Olympus1X-S8F2, Japan).

Protein quantification and Western Blot
(WB) analysis

Cell cycle analysis

Protein quantification and western blot analysis
were performed as described earlier [50]. Protein lysate
from various treatment groups were prepared using an ice
cold lysis buffer (50mmol/L Tris, PH 7.5 Triton ×-100,
0.25% NaF, 10mmol/L β- glycerolphosphate, 2mmol/L

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Flow cytometry analyses of the cell cycle were
performed at various time intervals following treatment
of RMS cells with GANT-61 at different concentrations.
Briefly, cells were detached from plates with the help of
Trypsin/EDTA, washed in phosphate-buffered saline,

and fixed with chilled methanol for 4 h. Methanol-fixed
cells were washed with PBS and incubated with RnaseA
(Sigma) at 37°C in water bath for 1 h. Then, these cells
were paletted out and re-suspended in DNA staining
solution, propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) for 1 h and passed
through BD FACS Calibur (BD biosciences, CA, USA).
Samples were analyzed for cell cycle analysis.

Clonogenic survival assay
RMS cells were seeded into 6-well plates at very
low density of 800-1000 cells per well and were allowed
to grow overnight. Then the plate attached cells were
treated with GANT-61 at various concentrations or vehicle
for 24 h. Drug or vehicle-treatment medium was replaced
by fresh drug-free medium and cells were incubated for
additional 10 days in humidified chamber at 37°C with 5%
CO2. Cell colonies were fixed with cold methanol, stained
with crystal violet, washed and air-dried. Blue colonies
were scored and photographed. Each condition was
replicated in triplicate. Data expressed as percent colonies
formed relative to the control using the formula: (Average
treated count)/(average control count) ×100.
