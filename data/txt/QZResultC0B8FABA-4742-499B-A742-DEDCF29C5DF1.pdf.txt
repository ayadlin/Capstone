BACKGROUND: Most patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have responded poorly to epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The authors investigated the involvement of insulinlike growth
factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling in primary resistance to EGFR TKIs and the molecular determinants of resistance to
IGF-1R TKIs. METHODS: Phosphorylated IGF-1R/insulin receptor (pIGF-1R/IR) was immunohistochemically evaluated in
an NSCLC tissue microarray. The authors analyzed the antitumor effects of an IGF-1R TKI (PQIP or OSI-906), either
alone or in combination with a small-molecular inhibitor (PD98059 or U0126) or with siRNA targeting K-Ras or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), in vitro and in vivo in NSCLC cells
with variable histologic features and EGFR or K-Ras mutations. RESULTS: pIGF-1R/IR expression in NSCLC specimens
was associated with a history of tobacco smoking, squamous cell carcinoma histology, mutant K-Ras, and wild-type
(WT) EGFR, all of which have been strongly associated with poor response to EGFR TKIs. IGF-1R TKIs exhibited significant antitumor activity in NSCLC cells with WT EGFR and WT K-Ras but not in those with mutations in these genes.
Introduction of mutant K-Ras attenuated the effects of IGF-1R TKIs on NSCLC cells expressing WT K-Ras. Conversely,
inactivation of MEK restored sensitivity to IGF-TKIs in cells carrying mutant K-Ras. CONCLUSIONS: The mutation status
of both EGFR and K-Ras could be a predictive marker of response to IGF-1R TKIs. Also, MEK antagonism can abroC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer, usually caused by years of tobacco smoking, is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.1
Because conventional chemotherapy has limited efficacy against lung cancer, new targeted therapeutic approaches are
being investigated. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is an attractive target in the development of lung cancer treatments. However, treatment with erlotinib and gefitinib, the 2 EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, has produced poor response rates in patients with nonsmall
cell lung cancer (NSCLC).2 Although a group of patients with somatic mutations in EGFR respond to these EGFR
TKIs,2-4 such mutations have been detected in only 5% of tumors from current or former smokers,2 and a response rate to
EGFR TKIs of only 3.9% has been reported in patients with NSCLC and a history of tobacco smoking compared with

24.7% in NSCLC patients who have never smoked,5 suggesting that EGFR may not be the appropriate target in
NSCLC patients with a history of tobacco smoking.
Signaling through the insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) has an essential role in cell mitosis, survival, and transformation6-9 and has been associated with
higher risk of multiple neoplasms.10-12 IGF-1 stimulates
IGF-1R and the IGF-1R/insulin receptor (IGF-1R/IR) heterodimers. Recently, we demonstrated activation of the
IGF-1R signaling axis during the early stages of lung carcinogenesis.13 We found that activation of IGF-1R in the
lungs of mice as a result of IGF-1 overexpression led to
spontaneous lung tumor development that progressed to
adenocarcinoma upon exposure to tobacco carcinogens.
This early stage of lung cancer development was suppressed
by administration of a selective IGF-1R TKI, cis-3-(3-[4
methyl-piperazin-l-yl]-cyclobutyl)-1-(2-phenyl-quinolin-7yl)-imidazo(1,5-a)pyrazin-8-ylamine (PQIP).13 Given the
importance of IGF-1R signaling in most human cancers
and the promising results of clinical trials targeting IGF-1R
for cancer therapy,14 we sought to evaluate the potential
application of IGF-1R TKIs in a series of NSCLC cells with
variable histologic and genetic characteristics to assess potential determinants of response or resistance to these drugs.
Here, we report that the activation of IGF-1R via
tobacco smoking, constitutive activation of EGFR via somatic mutations, and IGF-1R–independent activation of
signaling through mutant K-Ras are potential biomarkers
of response or resistance of NSCLC cells to small-molecule
IGF-1R TKIs, including PQIP and OSI-906. Our findings
provide a rationale for the therapeutic use of IGF-1R TKIs,
either singly or in combination with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(MEK) inhibitors, in tobacco smoking-related NSCLC,
particularly in tumors with K-Ras mutations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines
NSCLC cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection or provided by Dr. John Minna (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas,
Texas). The cell lines were authenticated by the Genetic
Resources Core Facility at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md) using DNA (short tandem repeat) profiling.
Protein Analysis
Antibodies detecting total IGF-1R (Santa Cruz, Calif),
pIGF-1Rb (Tyr1131/1146), pIGF-1Rb (Tyr1135/

3994

1136), pErk1/2, pAkt, pIRS-1, total IRS-1, total Erk1/2,
total Akt, actin, tubulin, or cleaved caspase-3 (all from
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass) were used for
Western blotting. The culture medium without serum
was harvested after 2 days of cell culture and concentrated
with a Centricon centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, Billerica, Mass), and the free IGF-1 in the medium was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (Webster, Tex). PQIP and OSI-906 were provided by OSI
Pharmaceuticals (Melville, NY). Reverse-phase protein
array was performed as previously described.15
Tissue Microarray of Primary Tumor
Specimens and the Analysis
Primary NSCLC tumor specimens were collected from
354 patients who had been treated at our institution
under an institutional review board–approved protocol
and had given their informed consent. Demographic information for those patients was described previously.16
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary NSCLC sections (5 lm thick) were placed in a tissue microarray
(TMA). Immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of the
NSCLC TMA was performed as previously described.16
Anti–pIGF-1R (Tyr 1135/1136)/IR (Tyr1162/1163)
antibody (Biosource, Camarillo, Calif; diluted 1:200) or
anti-pEGFR (Tyr1068) antibody (Zymed Laboratories,
San Francisco, Calif; diluted 1:100) was used for staining.
Immunostaining for IGF-1R, and pIGF-1R/IR (membrane) was quantified by a lung cancer pathologist who
used a 4-value intensity score (0, 1þ, 2þ, and 3þ), and
the extent of reactivity was expressed as a percentage. A
final staining score was calculated by multiplying the intensity score by the extent of reactivity value (range, 0300). EGFR exons 18 to 21 and the K-Ras mutational hot
spot codons 12, 13, and 61 were amplified as described
previously.3,4,17 Treated polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) products were sequenced using a Big Dye Terminator v3.1 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, Calif). Specimens with single or double EGFR and
K-Ras mutations were confirmed using repeated PCR and
sequencing, and the corresponding normal DNA was
sequenced to verify that the mutations were somatic.
In Vitro Drug Sensitivity and Apoptosis
Assays
The indicated NSCLC cells were treated with PQIP, either singly or in combination with MEK inhibitors, in
1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cell viability was

determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay as
described previously.18 At least 6 independent samples
were used for the assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed using
immunofluorescence staining with cleaved caspase-3 antibody (BioVision, Mountain View, Calif) as described previously.19 Adenovirus expressing dominant-negative
MEK1/2 was described previously,20 and siRNA against
K-Ras was purchased from Dharmacon (Longmont,
Colo). Anchorage-independent growth in 0.4% agarose
with a 1% agarose underlay was measured as described
previously.13

Animal Experiments
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with
a protocol approved by The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Athymic nude mice (BALB/c) were
obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Madison, Wis). Xenograft tumors were generated by subcutaneous injection
of H226B–K-Ras. Briefly, nude mice were injected at a
single dorsal flank site with 5  106 cells in 200 lL of
phosphate-buffered saline. When tumors reached a volume of 50 to 200 mm3, mice were treated orally with vehicle, OSI906 (40 mg/kg/d), U0126 (4 mg/kg, every
other day), or both OSI-906 and U0126; the first day of
drug treatment was termed day 0. Tumor size was measured every 2 days. Volumes were calculated by 0.5  a 
b2, in which a is the longer and b the shorter diameter.
Mean tumor volumes and 95% confidence intervals were
determined.

Statistical Analysis
For the TMA data, pIGF-1R expression levels for
NSCLC patients with different clinical and demographic
characteristics, including sex, history of tobacco smoking,
tumor histologic type, and EGFR and K-Ras mutation
status, were compared using Student t test, the MannWhitney U test, or analysis of variance. Correlations
among TMA specimens stained for pIGF-1R/IR and
pEGFR were identified using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. For the drug sensitivity analysis, the 2tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare sensitivity between the mutant and wild-type (WT) K-Ras
groups of cells. All analyses were conducted using SAS
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) or SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Ill). P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Activation of IGF-1R/IR Is Associated With
Histologic Features, History of Tobacco
Smoking, and Mutations of EGFR and K-Ras
in Human Lung Cancer
We evaluated the expression of pIGF-1R/IR in surgical
tumor sections obtained from patients with NSCLC.
pIGF-1R/IR staining was detected in the cell membrane
(50%), cytoplasm (100%), and nucleus (100%). Given
that the nature of IGF-1R as a membrane receptor and
the role of nuclear IGF-1R staining are still unclear, we
analyzed the membrane staining of pIGF-1R/IR.
Given the frequency of EGFR mutation (exons 1821) in NSCLC patients who have never smoked, those
with adenocarcinoma, and those with WT K-Ras2,4,17,21-23
and the crosstalk between the EGFR and IGF-1R signaling pathways, we assessed the correlation of pIGF-1R/IR
staining with the frequency of EGFR and K-Ras mutations in the NSCLC specimens. pIGF-1R/IR expression
levels were higher in patients with squamous cell carcinoma than in those with adenocarcinoma (P ¼ .019) and
were higher in patients with a history of tobacco smoking
(both former and current smokers) than in patients who
had never smoked. pIGF-1R/IR level and EGFR mutation were negatively correlated, with a marginal significance (Table 1). In addition, pIGF-1R/IR levels were
significantly higher in patients with mutant K-Ras than in
those with WT K-Ras. The negative correlation between
pIGF-1R/IR expression and mutant EGFR and the positive correlation between pIGF-1R/IR expression and
mutant K-Ras were also observed in patients with adenocarcinoma (data not shown). These findings suggest that
activation of the IGF-1R axis is strongly correlated with
tobacco smoking–induced lung carcinogenesis.
NSCLC Cell Lines Carrying Mutant EGFR Are
Independent of IGF-1R Signaling for Survival
and Proliferation
Given the negative association between pIGF-1R/IR level
and EGFR mutation, we sought to explore the impact of
EGFR mutation on the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to
PQIP, an IGF-1R/IR TKI.24 We first examined whether
the IGF-1R signaling pathway was functional in 6
NSCLC cell lines carrying mutant EGFR (L858R or
Del746-750). IGF-1–induced activation of IGF-1R signaling was well preserved (Fig. 1A) and was effectively
inhibited by PQIP (Fig. 1B) in the EGFR mutant cell
lines. However, the viability and anchorage-independent
colony-forming ability of these cells remained unchanged

after PQIP treatment (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest
that the NSCLC cells carrying mutant EGFR harbor
functional IGF-1R signaling but do not rely on the pathway for cell proliferation.

K-Ras Mutation Is a Key Determinant of the
Response of NSCLC Cell Lines carrying WT
EGFR to IGF-1R Inhibitors
Findings from the NSCLC TMA led us to hypothesize
that NSCLC cell lines that are derived from lung epithelial cells exposed to tobacco smoke25 could be dependent
on IGF-1R signaling for survival and proliferation, thus
providing a vulnerable point for pIGF-1R/IR—targeted
inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we examined a panel of
16 NSCLC cell lines carrying WT EGFR with various
histologic features (squamous cell carcinoma, bronchioalveolar carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma) and mutations in K-Ras and p53. We assessed the
effects of blockade of IGF-1R signaling by PQIP on the
proliferation and viability of these NSCLC cells. When
we tested the sensitivity to PQIP at different concentrations (0.2-10 lM), the 16 cell lines displayed differential
sensitivity to PQIP treatment (Fig. 2A). We sought to
identify predictive biomarkers of PQIP sensitivity in the
cells. Although no obvious correlation was seen between
PQIP sensitivity and the cells’ histologic features (Fig. 2A)
or expression levels of IGF-1R, IR, or pIGF-1R/IR (Fig.
2B), the NSCLC cells with mutant K-Ras (listed in black)
tended to have poorer sensitivity to PQIP than did those
with WT K-Ras (listed in blue) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, cell
lines carrying mutant K-Ras (n ¼ 7) showed significantly

higher viability than those carrying WT K-Ras (n ¼ 5) at
doses of 0.2 and 1.0 lM PQIP (P < .05; Fig. 2C).
To confirm the role of K-Ras mutation in PQIP resistance, we assessed the effects of PQIP on K-Ras mutant
and WT cells. To investigate the mechanism by which KRas mutation rescues NSCLC cells from PQIP treatment,
we examined the PQIP-induced antiproliferative activities
of H460 and H157 cells after mutant K-Ras was knocked
out by transfection with specific siRNA against K-Ras.
Both H460 and H157 cells revealed a significantly
enhanced PQIP sensitivity after K-Ras expression was
silenced by transfection with specific siRNA (Fig. 2D,
Top), indicating an essential role of mutant K-Ras in mediating PQIP resistance in the NSCLC cell lines. We next
assessed the effects of PQIP on IGF-1R signaling in H596
cells, which carry WT K-Ras, and A549 cells, which carry
mutant K-Ras. We found that PQIP treatment at 1 lM

almost completely inhibited IGF-induced IGF-1R and Akt
phosphorylation in H596 cells (Fig. 2D, Bottom). Similar
results were found in A549 cells, indicating that PQIP is
effective in blocking IGF-1R signaling in NSCLC cells
regardless of K-Ras mutation status. These results indicate
that the mechanism by which K-Ras mutation decreases
NSCLC cell sensitivity to PQIP is independent of the
ligand-induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R.
Mutant K-Ras Activates IGF-1R/Akt Signaling
but Leads to Resistance to IGF-1R/IR TKI
Given the strong positive correlation between IGF-1R activation and K-Ras mutation in the human NSCLC TMA
and the inverse correlation between PQIP sensitivity and
K-Ras mutation in NSCLC cell lines, we further assessed
the role of K-Ras mutation in the IGF-1R pathway and
PQIP sensitivity in H226B and H596 cells in which Green
Fluorescence Protein (GFP) or mutant K-Ras had been
transduced by retroviral infection. H226B–K-Ras cells
showed higher levels of pIGF-1R and pAkt and lower levels
of IGF-1R than those in H226B-GFP cells (Fig. 3A). We
also observed that H226B–K-Ras cells produced more
IGF-1 than H226B-GFP cells did. To characterize further
molecular sequelae triggered by mutant K-Ras, we performed a reverse-phase protein array. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses demonstrated that the PI3K/
Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways were activated by mutant KRas (Fig. 3B). Although PQIP treatment decreased pIGF1R/IR and pAkt levels in both cell lines, phosphorylation
of the downstream mediators of Akt, including pS6, and
pGSK, was efficiently inhibited by PQIP treatment in
H226B-GFP cells but not in H226B–K-Ras cells (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, H226B–K-Ras and H596–K-Ras cells were
significantly less sensitive to PQIP treatment than the control cells were (Fig. 3D), suggesting that IGF-1R signaling
is enhanced by mutant K-Ras; however, K-Ras mutation
abrogates NSCLC cell sensitivity to PQIP by activating
downstream signaling, including p70S6K.
Targeting MEK Overrides the Resistance of
Mutant K-Ras Cells to IGF-1R TKI
Because p70S6K is known to be activated by the MEK/
Erk pathway,26 which can be constitutively activated by
K-Ras mutation, we determined whether inactivation of
MEK would restore the antitumor effects of PQIP or
OSI-906 (a PQIP derivative currently undergoing a phase
1 clinical trial in our institute in NSCLC cell lines carrying mutant K-Ras). We found that cotargeting of MEK,
either with a small-molecule MEK inhibitor (PD98059

3998

or U0126) or with adenovirus expressing the dominantnegative form of MEK (Ad-MEK-DN), significantly
enhanced the effects of PQIP on cell viability (Fig. 4A)
and anchorage-independent colony-forming ability (Fig.
4B) in representative mutant K-Ras resistant cell lines.
Furthermore, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased by the combined treatment (Fig. 4C).
These results suggest that inactivation of MEK augments
the apoptotic activities of PQIP in NSCLC cells carrying
mutant K-Ras. We finally evaluated the combined effects
of OSI-906 and U0126 in vivo. The mice treated with vehicle or OSI-906 alone showed similar H226B K-Ras tumor growth (Fig. 4D). Pharmacologic inhibition of MEK
by administration of U0126 dramatically augmented the
effects of OSI-906 on the growth of the tumors. On day 8
after the first dose, the mean tumor volume for mice that
received combined OSI-906 and U0126 was significantly
smaller than the mean tumor volume for mice that
received vehicle, OSI-906 alone, or U0126 alone. IHC
staining of Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 in the tumors demonstrated that the combined treatment induced a decrease
in cell proliferation in association with an increase in cell
apoptosis in vivo (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these findings
underscore the pivotal role of activation of the MEK/Erk
pathway through K-Ras mutation in the primary resistance of NSCLC cells to IGF-1R TKIs.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we elucidate potential predictive
markers of response of NSCLC cells to IGF-1R TKIs. We
show that: 1) the expression of IGF-1R/IR in NSCLC
specimens is positively associated with a history of tobacco
smoking, squamous cell carcinoma, WT EGFR, and mutant K-Ras; 2) somatic mutation of EGFR, which confers
addiction to the EGFR signaling pathway, induces a lack
of primary response to IGF-1R TKIs in NSCLC cells;
and 3) K-Ras mutation causes increased production of
IGF-1 and activation of the IGF-1R pathway but induces
resistance to IGF-1R TKIs. Moreover, our findings provide a proof of principle that targeted inactivation of IGF1R by a TKI, in combination with MEK inhibition, can
achieve a favorable outcome in the treatment of NSCLC
patients with a history of tobacco smoking and mutant
K-Ras.
Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown
encouraging therapeutic efficacy of EGFR TKI in
NSCLC with mutant EGFR2,3; however, the limited
response rates to EGFR TKIs underscore the need to

develop effective treatment strategies for patients with
WT EGFR. Targeting the IGF-1R pathway is 1 emerging
strategy. The 2 major approaches are small-molecule
IGF-1R TKIs and anti–IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies.
However, limited data are available about predictors of
sensitivity to the anti–IGF-1R approaches. In this study,
we identified predictors that could be used in clinical trials
of IGF-1R TKIs in NSCLC patients. Previous studies
have shown high levels of IGF-1R expression in squamous
cell carcinoma histology.27 By analyzing a TMA of specimens from 354 patients with NSCLC, we extended this
observation, showing high levels of pIGF-1R/IR in
patients with squamous cell carcinoma. These data suggest that squamous cell carcinoma may be more sensitive
to IGF-1R TKIs than lung adenocarcinoma is. However,
previous reports and our current results show that tumor
histology is not a predictive marker of response to IGF1R–targeted strategies. We also observed significantly elevated pIGF-1R/IR levels in patients with a history of
tobacco smoking, those with mutant K-Ras, and those
with WT EGFR, all of which have been strongly associated with poor response to EGFR TKIs.
Numerous studies have suggested that human cancer cells can be highly dependent on single or multiple
pathways that are overly activated, conferring tumorigenic
potential,28-30 and successful anticancer therapeutic strategies would rely on the selection of patients harboring
tumors that rely on those pathways for cell growth and
survival. Our previous and current findings show that
transformed lung epithelial cell lines induced by tobacco
smoking components had an elevated expression of pIGF1R/IR and were sensitive to the molecularly targeted strategies against the IGF-1R system.31,32 Tobacco smoking
components such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1- (3-pyridyl)-1-butanone have been shown to induce genetic
changes in p53 and PTEN, which regulate IGF-2 and
IGF-1R expression.33,34 NNK can also induce phosphorylation and degradation of p53 via activation of Akt.35
Although we did not have mechanistic evidence for
tobacco smoking-induced activation of IGF-1R/IR signaling in lung carcinogenesis, impact of the IGF-1R pathway in cell proliferation and survival suggested that
targeting IGF-1R could be an effective therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with tobacco smoking history.
This notion and our subsequent findings, including 1) the
characteristics of patients with NSCLC harboring elevated pIGF-1R/IR levels were negatively correlated with
those of patients harboring EGFR mutation, and (2)
PQIP treatment effectively inhibited stimulation of the

IGF-1R pathway but had little antitumor activity in mutant EGFR-expressing NSCLC cells, led us to hypothesize
that a history of tobacco smoking and EGFR mutation are
predictive biomarkers for absence of responsive to IGF1R TKIs. However, we found that only a subset of human
NSCLC cell lines with high pIGF-1R/IR levels and WT
EGFR were sensitive to PQIP treatment. These observations suggest that EGFR mutation is not a predictive
marker to response to IGF-1R TKI-based therapies.
Considering the potential mechanisms of crosstalk
between EGFR and IGF-1R signaling,18,36-38 inhibition
of IGF-1R signaling could have been compensated for
by enhanced activation through EGFR. However,
NSCLC cells expressing mutant Ras did not exhibit significantly enhanced sensitivity in response to cotargeting
of IGF-1R and EGFR by treatment with PQIP and the
EGFR TKI erlotinib, whereas the same regimen significantly reduced cell viability in a subset of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma cell lines carrying WT K-Ras
(data not shown).
It has been suggested that sensitivity of NSCLC cells
to TKIs of IGF-1R and EGFR, either alone or their combination, is determined by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition.36,39 However, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition status was not a consistent predictive marker for
insensitivity to antagonism against IGF-1R or to cotargeting IGF-1R and EGFR.36 These findings indicate the
involvement of additional biomolecules that differentiate
the NSCLC cell response to IGF-1R TKIs.
Our current findings from several in vitro and in
vivo experiments indicate that mutant K-Ras differentiates
the response to IGF-1R inhibitors. In the current study,
we found evidence that activation of the IGF-1R pathway
is correlated with K-Ras mutation, which may increase
IGF-1 production, as shown by significantly higher levels
of IGF-1 in the conditioned media from H226B cells harboring mutant K-Ras compared with those harboring WT
K-Ras (Fig. 3A). Therefore, K-Ras mutation could be a
driving force for activation of the IGF-1R pathway and
may thus be a predictive marker of sensitivity to IGF-1R
blocking. However, our subsequent results clearly show
that mutant K-Ras is a poor predictive marker of the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs: 1) mutant K-Ras led to
increased resistance to PQIP in many assay systems, and
2) the inactivation of K-Ras or MEK by genomic
approaches (siRNA targeting K-Ras, Ad-MEK-DN) or
pharmacologic approaches (PD98059, U0126) induced
antitumor activity of IGF-1R TKIs (PQIP, OSI-906) in
vitro and in vivo in mutant K-Ras cell lines. These

findings highlight the need for stratification of patients
on the basis of K-Ras mutation, in addition to history of
tobacco smoking and EGFR mutation, when an IGF1R–targeted therapeutic regimen is considered in clinical
trials.
In summary, this study characterizes potential predictive markers of actions of IGF-1R TKIs. Our findings
show that activation of IGF-1R/IR is mutually exclusive
with activation of EGFR and is associated with tobacco
smoking in NSCLC, suggesting that transformed lung
epithelial cells and NSCLC cells are dependent on IGF1R/IR signaling for survival and sustained proliferation.
However, we also provide evidence for the first time that
mutation in K-Ras is associated with activation of IGF-1R
and the development of physiologically redundant signaling in patients with NSCLC, implicating mutant K-Ras as
an important predictive marker to optimize the clinical efficacy of the IGF-1R–targeting strategy. Further investigation is warranted into the discovery of the predictive
biomarkers for IGF-1R–targeted therapy and the exact
mechanism of synergy between IGF-1R TKIs and MEK
inhibitors.
