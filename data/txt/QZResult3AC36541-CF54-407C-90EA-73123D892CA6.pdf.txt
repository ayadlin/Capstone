ABSTRACT
Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9) is required for sumoylation and inhibits
apoptosis via Bcl-2 by unknown mechanism. Methionine adenosyltransferase 2A
(MAT2A) encodes for MATα2, the catalytic subunit of the MATII isoenzyme that
synthesizes S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). Ubc9, Bcl-2 and MAT2A expression are
up-regulated in several malignancies. Exogenous SAMe decreases Ubc9 and MAT2A
expression and is pro-apoptotic in liver and colon cancer cells. Here we investigated
whether there is interplay between Ubc9, MAT2A and Bcl-2. We used human colon
and liver cancer cell lines RKO and HepG2, respectively, and confirmed key finding in
colon cancer specimens. We found MATα2 can regulate Bcl-2 expression at multiple
levels. MATα2 binds to Bcl-2 promoter to activate its transcription. This effect is
independent of SAMe as MATα2 catalytic mutant was also effective. MATα2 also
directly interacts with Bcl-2 to enhance its protein stability. MATα2’s effect on Bcl-2
requires Ubc9 as MATα2’s stability is influenced by sumoylation at K340, K372 and
K394. Overexpressing wild type (but not less stable MATα2 sumoylation mutants)
protected from 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis in both colon and liver cancer cells.
Colon cancer have higher levels of sumoylated MATα2, total MATα2, Ubc9 and Bcl2 and higher MATα2 binding to the Bcl-2 P2 promoter. Taken together, Ubc9’s
protective effect on apoptosis may be mediated at least in part by sumoylating
and stabilizing MATα2 protein, which in turn positively maintains Bcl-2 expression.
These interactions feed forward to further enhance growth and survival of the
cancer cell.

SUMO-1 regulates protein stability and activity with
crucial implications for many cellular pathways [3]. In
contrast, protein conjugates with heterologous SUMO-2/3ubiquitin chains are preferentially targeted for proteasome
degradation and the function of SUMO-4 is unknown
[4–6]. Sumoylation is a multiple-step process, involving
maturation, activation, conjugation and ligation [1].

INTRODUCTION
SUMO is a small ubiquitin-like protein that can be
covalently attached to proteins through the formation of
isopeptide bonds with specific lysine residues of target
proteins [1]. Four SUMO family members (SUMO-1
to -4) are encoded by distinct genes in mammals [2].

RESULTS

Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9) is the only E2
conjugating enzyme and therefore a key regulator of the
sumoylation machinery, transferring the activated SUMO
to protein substrates [7]. Sumoylation is involved in many
vital processes including transcriptional regulation, signal
transduction, protein degradation, cell cycle regulation,
chromatin organization, and nuclear transport [8].
Dysregulated sumoylation contributes to carcinogenesis
by affecting post-transcriptional modification of key
proteins [9], including those involved in cancer metastasis
[10–12].
Ubc9 has been shown to be a positive regulator
of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression in breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 [13]. Furthermore, higher rate
of apoptosis and poor survival in the MCF-7 cells
expressing dominant negative Ubc9 were associated
with down-regulation of Bcl-2 [14]. Effect of Ubc9 on
Bcl-2 expression was thought to be mediated by the
estrogen receptor in MCF-7 cells [13], but the exact
mechanism was not explored. Bcl-2 was identified first
as an apoptotic regulator, the oncoprotein activated
via chromosome translocation in human follicular
lymphoma [15]. Bcl-2 acts by promoting cell survival
rather than by driving cell proliferation as critical step
in tumor development [15].
Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is an
essential cellular enzyme that catalyzes the formation
of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the principal
biological methyl donor [16]. In mammals, this
essential enzyme is the product of two different genes,
MAT1A and MAT2A, which display a distinct pattern
of expression among different tissues. MAT1A encodes
for α1 that forms dimer (MATIII) and tetramer (MATI)
that are predominantly expressed in liver parenchymal
cells; while MAT2A encodes the α2 catalytic subunit
of the MATII isoenzyme that is expressed in all other
tissues [16]. Human liver and colon cancers have
higher MAT2A expression [17–19], which is essential
for growth as silencing MAT2A by sequence-specific
small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited growth
and induced apoptosis [19, 20]. We reported that
SAMe treatment lowered Ubc9 protein expression
and sumoylation in liver, colon and breast cancer
cell lines [10]. We also reported SAMe treatment
lowered MAT2A expression and is pro-apoptotic in
liver and colon cancer cell lines [17, 20]. Since SAMe
lowers the expression of both Ubc9 and MAT2A and
knockdown of Ubc9 and MAT2A leads to apoptosis,
we examined whether there might be interplay between
MAT2A and Bcl-2 that is regulated by sumoylation.
In the course of this work, we uncovered highly novel
aspects of MATα2 function, namely the ability of
MATα2 to regulate Bcl-2 expression by transcriptional
and post-translational mechanisms that is modulated
by sumoylation.

Effects of SAMe and methylthioadenosine (MTA)
on Bcl-2 expression in HepG2 and RKO cells
We previously reported that treatment with SAMe
and its metabolite MTA induced apoptosis in HepG2 and
RKO cells [19, 20] and lowered Ubc9 protein stability [10].
Ubc9 has been shown to regulate apoptosis as a positive
regulator of Bcl-2 expression in breast cancer MCF-7
cells [14]. We next examined whether Ubc9 also regulate
apoptosis and Bcl-2 expression in HepG2 and RKO cells.
Treatment of HepG2 and RKO cells with Ubc9 siRNA
(siUbc9) for 48 hours, or SAMe (2 mM) or MTA (1 mM)
for 24 hours increased % apoptosis more than 5-, 3- and
3.5-fold, respectively (Figure 1A–1B). In both HepG2 and
RKO cells, knockdown of Ubc9 lowered Bcl-2 mRNA
level after 48 hours by 39% and 40% (Figure 1C–1D),
respectively. However, Western blot analysis shows the
Bcl-2 protein level decreased by ~70% in both of cell lines
(Figure 1C–1D). SAMe and MTA treatment also reduced
Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 1E–1F).

Effect of MAT2A silencing on Bcl-2 expression in
HepG2 and RKO cells
Bcl-2 protein has well-known anti-apoptotic
functions [21, 22]. In addition to lowering Ubc9 and
Bcl-2 expression, SAMe and MTA treatment also lowered
MAT2A expression [20] and knockdown of MAT2A in
HepG2 and RKO cells induced apoptosis [17, 19]. These
observations prompted us to examine whether there is
interplay between MAT2A, Ubc9 and Bcl2. We used a
gene silencing and overexpression of MAT2A approach
in combination with siUbc9 or siSUMO-1 for 48 hours in
HepG2 and RKO cells. Knockdown of MAT2A resulted in
a 45% and 50% reduction in Bcl-2 mRNA level compared
to a negative control siRNA, respectively, similar to the
effects of siUbc9 and siSUMO-1 treatments (Figure 2A and
Supplementary Figure S1A). Interestingly, overexpression
of MAT2A increased Bcl-2 mRNA level by 3.3- and 3.4fold as compared empty vector control and this inductive
effect was largely eliminated if cells were also treated with
siUbc9 or siSUMO-1 (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure
S1A). We next examined the Bcl-2 promoter activity under
the same experimental conditions in HepG2 and RKO
cells. Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S1B show that
Bcl-2 promoter activity highly correlated with the mRNA
level results; specifically, knockdown of MAT2A, Ubc9
or SUMO-1 all lowered Bcl-2 promoter activity, while
overexpression of MAT2A increased Bcl-2 promoter activity
but not if either Ubc9 or SUMO-1 was knocked down
(Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Figures 2C
and Supplementary Figure S1C show Western blot analyses
under the same experimental conditions. MAT2A, Ubc9 or

SUMO-1 knockdown lowered Bcl-2 protein level even more
than mRNA level, whereas MAT2A overexpression raised
Bcl-2 protein level but not if cells were also treated with
either siUbc9 or siSUMO-1 (Figure 2C and Supplementary
Figure S1C). In addition, we found that Ubc9 and SUMO-1
silencing had no effect on MAT2A mRNA level (data not
shown), but MATα2 protein level fell markedly by ~65%
(siUbc9) to ~80% (siSUMO-1) in HepG2 and RKO cells
(Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S1C). These results
suggest that sumoylation machinery and MATα2 protein
play key roles on Bcl-2 expression at both transcriptional
and post-translational levels. In addition, MATα2 protein
stability may also be controlled by sumoylation.

lowered this binding in both RKO and HepG2 cells by
43% and 58%, respectively (Figure 3E). Figure 3F shows
that MATα2 exhibited enhanced binding to the Bcl-2
P2 promoter region in colorectal cancer compared with
corresponding surrounding non-tumorous tissues by 88%.

MATα2 sumoylation in vitro
Our results show that Ubc9 and SUMO-1
knockdown lower MATα2 protein level in both HepG2
and RKO cells (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure
S1C). Sumoylation by SUMO-1 has been shown to control
stability of its protein target [25]. Using SUMOplot,
SUMOsp2.0 and GSP-SUMO-1 sumoylation prediction
software, we identified four potential sumoylated sites
on MATα2 protein sequence (Figure 4A). To investigate
whether MATα2 is sumoylated in vitro, we carried
out in vitro sumoylation assays using highly purified
MATα2 recombinant protein and commercially available
SUMOylation assay kit [26]. Sumoylated target proteins
show higher molecular weight compared with wild-type
(WT) proteins [27]. Figure 4B shows that MATα2 is
sumoylated by SUMO-1, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3.

DNA binding of MATα2 to Bcl-2 P2 promoter
sequences
Bcl-2 transcription is regulated positively by Bcl-2
P2 promoter activity [23]. Using BindN [24] and Naïve
Bayes prediction DNA-binding models, we identified
several potential DNA-binding sites present in the
MATα2 protein sequence (Figure 3A). Also, we identified
four putative MATα2 protein binding sites on Bcl-2 P2
promoter sequence from −749 to +1 using PROMO
prediction software (Figure 3B). We analyzed predicted
binding sites 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 3C and 3D) because the
dissimilarity threshold (the parameter that controls how
similar a sequence must be to the matrix) was higher than
15% rated by PROMO software. To critically analyze
the ability of MATα2 protein to bind Bcl-2 P2 promoter
in vitro, gel retardation and supershift analysis of these
individual elements were performed. Double-stranded
oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S1) corresponding
to the putative Bcl-2 P2 promoter MATα2 binding sites
were examined for their ability to interact with RKO
nuclear protein lysate. This analysis demonstrated that
all three Bcl-2 P2 promoter sites specifically interacted
with MATα2, forming complexes that supershifted
in the presence of anti-MATα2 antibody (Figure 3C).
Same results were obtained using nuclear protein lysate
from HepG2 cells (data not shown). Direct interaction
between MATα2 and these DNA binding sites was further
confirmed using recombinant MATα2 (Figure 3D).

MATα2 is sumoylated in human colorectal
tissues, HepG2 and RKO cells
Since MATα2 is localized in both nuclear and
cytoplasmic compartments [28], we investigated whether
MATα2 is sumoylated in vivo and where the sumoylated
form is localized in HepG2 cells. Figure 5A shows that
MATα2 is sumoylated in both compartments by SUMO-1;
however, despite the fact that the bulk of total MATα2
is in the cytoplasmic compartment, there is much more
sumoylated MATα2 in the nucleus. Knocking down
Ubc9 reduced both SUMO-1-sumoylated and total
MATα2 (Figure 5B). Reverse IP using anti-SUMO-1
antibody followed by Western blotting confirmed MATα2
sumoylation by SUMO-1, which is reduced comparably
by either Ubc9 or SUMO-1 knockdown in HepG2 and
RKO cells (Figure 5C). Finally, Figure 5D shows in paired
colon cancer and adjacent non-tumorous tissues, MATα2 is
SUMO-1 sumoylated and SUMO-1-MATα2 level is nearly
doubled in colon cancer. In the same specimens the protein
levels of Ubc9, MATα2 and Bcl-2 are all higher in cancer.

MATα2 binds to Bcl-2 P2 promoter in HepG2,
RKO cells and human colon cancer specimens

Bcl-2 directly interacts with MATα2 and Ubc9 in
HepG2 and RKO cells

The results above show that MATα2 protein
binds Bcl-2 P2 promoter elements. We next used the
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to confirm
that MATα2 can bind to Bcl-2 P2 promoter region in
endogenous chromatin configuration in living cells and
examine whether this is increased in human colon cancer
where MATα2 is overexpressed [20]. MATα2 strongly
interacts with the Bcl-2 P2 promoter and Ubc9 knockdown

Since MATα2 and Ubc9 knockdown lowered Bcl-2
protein level further than the mRNA level, we examined
whether Bcl-2 interacts with MATα2 and Ubc9 in HepG2
and RKO cells. Figure 6A and 6B show that Bcl-2
co-immunoprecipitated with MATα2 and Ubc9 and silencing
of Ubc9 lowered their interaction. Also, we tested whether

MATα2 and Bcl-2 physically interact in vitro using highly
purified Bcl-2 and MATα2 recombinant proteins. Figure 6C
shows that MATα2 and Bcl-2 form a complex in vitro and
sumoylated MATα2 leads to higher complex formation.

we compared overexpression of wild type MATα2 or
MATα2 catalytic mutant (MATα2 D134A) which lacks
catalytic function [28]. Overexpression of either wild
type or catalytic mutant of MATα2 raised Bcl-2 promoter
activity (Figure 8A), mRNA (Figure 8B) and protein
levels (Figure 8D), albeit the wild type construct was more
inductive. This may be related to lower expression of the
mutant MATα2 (Figures 8C and 8D).

Mutation of MATα2 sumoylation binding sites
influence protein stability of MATα2 and Bcl-2
Since knockdown of either Ubc9 or SUMO-1
lowered MATα2 protein level without affecting the mRNA
level, we hypothesize that sumoylation regulates MATα2
protein stability. We examined whether the predicted
SUMO binding sites (Figure 4A) are relevant for MATα2
protein stability by mutating K311, K340, K372 and K394
and measured MATα2 protein stability in RKO cells. For
this purpose, we created mutations in the overexpression
vector of hMAT2A DDK-tagged at K311, K340, K372 and
K394 (to R311, R340, R372 and R394) (Supplementary
Table S2) and examined the total MATα2 protein level
using Western blotting analysis. Figure 6D shows that
mutation at K340 (M2), K372 (M3) and K394 (M4)
(but not K311, or M1) resulted in a less stable MATα2
as demonstrated by measurement of protein half-life in
RKO cells. Overexpressing mutant MATα2 constructs had
no influence on the endogenous MATα2 protein stability
(results not shown). To test whether MATα2 is required for
Bcl-2 protein stability, we tested the effect of expressing
MATα2 WT or mutants for 36 hours on Bcl-2 protein level
by Western blotting analysis in RKO cells. Figure 6E shows
that MATα2 WT and M1 overexpression increased Bcl-2
protein level by about 2-fold compared to empty vector
control, whereas mutants M2, M3 and M4 overexpression
had no effect on Bcl-2 protein level. Overexpression of WT
and mutant MAT2A constructs was able to raise MAT2A
mRNA level more than 300 fold over empty vector at 24
hours (Supplementary Figure S2A). Overexpressing WT,
M1 and M4 also raised Bcl-2 mRNA level comparably,
whereas overexpressing M2 and M3 did not significantly
affect Bcl-2 mRNA level (Supplementary Figure S2B).

DISCUSSION
Sumoylation modifies the activity of key regulatory
proteins, including oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, cell
cycle regulators, and enzymes involved in DNA repair
[29]. Therefore, alterations in protein sumoylation and
de-sumoylation caused by deregulation of Ubc9 alone or
any component of the sumoylation machinery would affect
the cellular pathways linked to tumorigenesis and related
biological consequences [30, 31]. Sumoylation modulates
many proteins implicated in apoptosis such as Fas, TNFR1,
Daxx, p53 and its regulator MDM2 [32, 33] and Ubc9 has
been demonstrated to regulate Bcl-2 expression through the
estrogen receptor signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells [13].
Our earlier works led us to suspect there may be
interplay between sumoylation, MAT2A and Bcl-2.
Specifically, Ubc9 and MAT2A expression are increased
in both liver and colon cancers and SAMe, which lower
both Ubc9 and MAT2A expression, induces apoptosis
in these cancer cells [16]. Bcl-2 is an oncoprotein that
function by promoting cancer cell survival rather than
proliferation [34]. Increased Bcl-2 expression is linked
to chemoresistance [35] and targeting this has been an
emerging strategy in cancer treatment [36]. To examine
interaction between sumoylation, MAT2A and Bcl-2, we
used HepG2 and RKO cells as SAMe treatment lowered
MAT2A and Ubc9 expression and induced apoptosis in
these cells [10, 17, 20]. Moreover, both cell types do not
express estrogen receptor [37, 38]. We found that similar
to MCF-7 cells [13], knockdown of Ubc9 in HepG2 and
RKO cells also lowered Bcl-2 expression. However, the
mechanism is independent of the estrogen receptor. Of
considerable interest, Ubc9 knockdown lowered Bcl-2
protein level much more than mRNA level (Figure 1C–1D
and Supplementary Figure S1C–S1D), suggesting that
Ubc9 affects Bcl-2 expression at both transcriptional
and post-translation levels. Ubc9 knockdown induced
apoptosis, similar to SAMe and MTA treatment in HepG2
and RKO cells (Figure 1A–1B). SAMe and MTA treatment
lowered Bcl-2 expression (Figure 1E–1F), an effect that
has not been previously reported and likely also contribute
to their pro-apoptotic effect in these cancer cell lines.
SAMe is the principal methyl donor and precursor
of polyamines synthesized by MAT1A and MAT2Aencoded isoenzymes [16]. MAT1A is often silenced in
human liver cancer and overexpression of MAT1A in liver

Overexpressing stable forms of MATα2 protects
cancer cells from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced
apoptosis
Overexpressing WT and M1 sumoylation MATα2
mutant (stability not affected) protected against 5-FUinduced apoptosis in both HepG2 and RKO cells but M2M4 sumoylation MATα2 mutants were either ineffective
or minimally effective (Figure 7).

Effects of MATα2 on Bcl-2 expression are
independent of SAMe
Since MATα2 catalyzes the formation of SAMe,
which could affect gene and protein expression indirectly,

cancer cells resulted in higher SAMe level and increased
apoptosis [39]. Our current results are consistent with
the notion that higher SAMe level led to reduced Bcl2 expression observed in MAT1A transfected HepG2
cells [40]. MAT2A expression is increased in human
colon cancer tissues and cells treated with mitogens,
whereas silencing MAT2A resulted in apoptosis [19, 20].
In both HepG2 and RKO cells, knockdown of MAT2A
decreased, whereas MAT2A overexpression increased
Bcl-2 expression (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S1).
This appears to contradict the effect of exogenous SAMe
treatment since MAT2A knockdown reduced intracellular
SAMe level [17]. Thus, the effect of MAT2A expression
on Bcl-2 appears to be independent of SAMe and is
very similar to the effect of Ubc9 so that both MAT2A
and Ubc9 knockdown lowered Bcl-2 expression at the
promoter level as well at the protein level. Furthermore,
overexpression of MAT2A increased Bcl-2 promoter
activity and protein level but this effect required Ubc9
(Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S1). Since Ubd9
can have sumoylation-dependent and independent actions
[41], we also examined the effect of SUMO-1 knockdown
on Bcl-2 expression, which produced essentially the same
effect as Ubc9 and MAT2A knockdown. Importantly,
both SUMO-1 and Ubc9 knockdown drastically reduced
MATα2 protein level, without affecting MAT2A mRNA
level. Taken together, these results support our conclusion
that MATα2 is sumoylated by SUMO-1, which stabilizes
MATα2 protein and MATα2 is the link between Ubc9 and
Bcl-2 expression in these cells.
MATα2 regulates Bcl-2 expression at both the
promoter and protein levels. This is supported by the fact
that the effect is more pronounced at the protein level when
MAT2A is knocked down (Figure 2 and Supplementary
Figure S1). In the only report thus far on MATα2’s ability
to regulate at the transcriptional level, MATα2 was found
to be a transcriptional corepressor by providing a local
source of SAMe and interacting with chromatin-related
factors [28]. However, our results suggest MATα2 can act
as a bona fide transcription factor as overexpression of
the catalytic mutant was equally effective in raising Bcl-2
promoter activity (Figure 8). The ability of MATα2 to bind
DNA is unknown and it has not been shown to activate
genes transcriptionally. Consistent with previous report
on transcriptional factors DNA binding [42], we found
that MATα2 protein could potentially bind to DNA by its
C-terminal domain (Figure 3A). Following the prediction
data in Figure 3B, we next examined the binding ability
of MATα2 to three potential Bcl-2 P2 promoter binding
sites (Figure 3B and Supplementary Table S1). We focused
on the P2 promoter because the P2 promoter positively
regulates Bcl-2 expression [23]. We confirmed that
MATα2 can bind to all three predicted binding sites on
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and supershift
assays and the interaction is direct and requires no other

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proteins (Figure 3C–3D). Furthermore, these findings
were verified by ChIP assays, which clearly demonstrated
that MATα2 interacts with Bcl-2 P2 promoter in cells
and in human colon cancer samples (Figure 3F). MATα2
binding to the Bcl-2 P2 promoter was reduced by Ubc9
knockdown, which is likely due to the fact that MATα2
protein level was reduced. However, we cannot rule out
the possibility that sumoylation also influences proteinprotein interaction and/or MATα2’s ability to bind DNA
as sumoylation can affect DNA-binding activity of
transcription factors [43].
Given the fact that both SUMO-1 and Ubc9
knockdown drastically reduced MATα2 protein level
without affecting its mRNA level, we suspect critical
sumoylation sites are present in the MATα2 protein
sequence that affect its stability. Consistently, four potential
sites are present in its protein sequence and we demonstrate
MATα2 can be sumoylated in vitro by SUMO-1 as well as
SUMO-2/3 (Figure 4B). We focused on SUMO-1 because
it is known to stabilize proteins [3], while SUMO-2/3
chain formation promotes targeted protein degradation
via proteasome [5]. We confirmed in vivo that MATα2 is
sumoylated by SUMO-1 at baseline and Ubc9 and SUMO-1
silencing resulted in decreased MATα2 protein level (Figure
5B–5C). Interestingly, SUMO-1 sumoylated MATα2 is
preferentially localized in the nuclear compartment (Figure
5A), and SUMO-1 sumoylation has been shown to play a
key role for nuclear targeting and function of transcription
factor ZIC3 [44]. We speculate a similar role may be true
for SUMO-1 sumoylation of MATα2, which will require
further examination. MATα2 is also SUMO-1 sumoylated
in normal colon tissue and this is enhanced in colon cancer
and higher protein levels of Ubc9, MATα2 and Bcl-2 all
occur in the cancer tissues (Figure 5D). Through point
mutation analysis and cycloheximide (CHX) pulse-chase
experiments, we determined that the critical sites for
MATα2 stability were at the K340, K372, and K394 found
in the C-terminus (Figure 6D and Supplementry Table S2).
Therefore, SUMOylation of MATα2 plays a critical role in
its protein stability and this is likely achieved by SUMO1. The functional outcome(s) of SUMO-2/3 sumoylation
of MATα2 is unclear and will be a subject of future
investigation.
MATα2 also regulates Bcl-2 at the protein level. To
our surprise, we found that MATα2 physically interacts
with Bcl-2 directly and sumoylated MATα2 formed
complex with Bcl-2 more efficiently in vitro (Figure 6C).
Consistently, we found that Ubc9 knockdown resulted in
decreased Bcl-2/MATα2 complex in HepG2 and RKO
cells (Figure 6A–6B). It is noteworthy that overexpression
of MATα2 sumoylation mutants M2, M3 and M4 was
unable to raise Bcl-2 protein level (Figure 6E), suggesting
that Bcl-2/MATα2 complex formation requires MATα2
sumoylation and may protect Bcl-2 from degradation.
This is supported by the finding that despite comparable

37718

Oncotarget

elevation in Bcl-2 mRNA levels by WT, M1 and M4
MAT2A constructs, only WT and M1 raised Bcl-2 protein
level. However, sumoylation at K340 (M2) and K372 (M3)
may also be important for MATα2 to bind and activate
the Bcl-2 promoter since Bcl-2 mRNA level did not
increase with their overexpression. This is also consistent
with the result that Ubc9 knockdown lowered MATα2
binding to the Bcl-2 promoter (Figure 3D). Finally, we
demonstrated the significance of MATα2 overexpression
on conferring chemoresistance as protection against 5-FUinduced apoptosis was most pronounced in cancer cells
overexpressing wild type or sumoylation mutant that does
not affect MATα2 stability (Figure 7).
In summary, our current work uncovered, to our
knowledge, a previously unreported function of MATα2,
namely the ability to act as a transcriptional factor that
positively regulates the transcriptional activity of Bcl-2.
In addition, MATα2 is sumoylated, which stabilizes the
protein. Sumoylated MATα2 is able to interact better with
Bcl-2 and this interaction stabilizes Bcl-2. These results

are summarized in Figure 9. Our findings show MATα2
regulates Bcl-2 expression at transcriptional and posttranslational levels and is the dominant link between
Ubc9 and Bcl-2. These findings provide novel insights
on MATα2’s transcriptional factor function, regulation of
Bcl-2, and how the interplay between Ubc9, MATα2 and
Bcl-2 can confer survival benefit to the cancer cell.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
SAMe, in the stable form of disulfate p-toluene
sulfonate dried powder was generously provided by Gnosis
SRL (Cairate, Italy) and MTA, CHX, 5-FU, and SYBR®
Green I nucleic acid gel staining were from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). MATα2 and Bcl-2 recombinant proteins
were purchased from GenWay Biotech (San Diego, CA).
All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained
from commercial sources.

Figure 9: Simplified schematic of key findings. MATα2 is sumoylated by SUMO-1 at basal level. Sumoylated MATα2 regulates

Bcl-2 mRNA level via binding to Bcl-2 P2 promoter elements and increasing its activity. Sumoylated MATα2 also forms a protein complex
with Bcl-2, resulting in higher Bcl-2 protein stability. This positive feed forward loop protects against apoptosis.

Cell culture and SAMe/MTA treatment

(Carlsbad, CA) with MAT2A, Ubc9 and SUMO-1 siRNA
(20 nM), or scrambled control siRNA for 48 hours for
mRNA or protein expression, following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

HepG2 and RKO cells were obtained from the
Cell Separation and Culture Core of the University of
Southern California Liver Disease Research Center and
grown according to instructions provided by American
Type Cell Collection. Cells were grown in 10% fetal
bovine serum for 24 hours and media was changed prior
to SAMe (2 mmol/L) or MTA (1 mmol/L) treatment for
another 24 hours. Because of the instability of SAMe,
medium was changed every 6 hours for all conditions in
experiments that included SAMe.

Western blots and co-immunoprecipitation
(co-IP)
Total protein extracts from HepG2, RKO and
colon samples were prepared as described [17] while
nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins from HepG2 were
prepared using EpiQuick Nuclear Extraction Kit I
(Epigenetek, Farmingdale, NY). Protein extracts were
immunoprecipitated by specific MATα2, SUMO-1
or Bcl-2 antibodies and processes as reported [46].
Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western
blotting following standard protocols (Amersham
BioSciences, Piscataway, NJ), and the membranes
were probed with the anti-MATα2 (Novus, Littleton,
CO), anti-SUMO-1, anti-Ubc9 (Genetex, Irvine, CA)
and anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA) antibodies. Blots were developed using enhanced
chemoluminescence.

Tissue specimens
Five pairs of colon cancer and corresponding
surrounding non-tumorous tissue from surgical resection
for primary colon cancer were used. Colon tissues
were obtained by Professor Giordano P (Whipps Cross
University Hospital, London, UK). These tissues were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent
protein extraction. Written informed consent was obtained
from each patient. The study protocol conformed to the
ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as
reflected in a priori approval by Keck School of Medicine
University of Southern California’s human research
review committee.

Overexpression of wt and mutant MAT2A
Myc-DDK-tagged MAT2A overexpression vector
(MAT2A-pCMV6) and negative control empty vector
(pCMV6) were purchased from Origene (Rockville,
MD). Catalytic MATα2 mutant (D134A) lacking
catalytic function was prepared as previously described
[28] and verified by sequencing. Mutations of MATα2
SUMO-binding Lysine sites (K311, K340, K372, K394)
to Arginine were performed by Quick Change II SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)
with pCMV6 as the template. All of the primers were
synthesized by Valuegene (San Diego, CA) and simply
PAGE purified (Supplementary Table S2). RKO and
HepG2 cells were cultured in 6-well plates (0.4×106 cells/
well), transfected using 5 μl of JetPRIME from Polyplus
(New York, NY) and 2 μg of target plasmid per well. After
4 hours, the transfection medium was changed to normal
medium and the cells were cultured for an additional 20
hours for promoter activity assay, mRNA and protein
expression as indicated.

RNA extraction and real-time polymerase chain
reaction analysis
Total RNA isolated from HepG2 and RKO cells and
colon tissues as described [45] was subjected to reverse
transcription (RT) by using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One μl of RT product was
subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The
primers and TaqMan probes for Ubc9, Bcl-2 and MAT2A
and Universal PCR Master Mix were purchased from ABI
(Foster City, CA). 18SrRNA was used as housekeeping
gene as described [20]. The delta Ct (ΔCt) obtained was
used to find the relative expression of genes according to
the formula: relative expression n = 2-ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt=
ΔCt of respective genes in experimental groups – ΔCt of
the same genes in control group.

RNA interference

Bcl-2 promoter reporter assay

The predesigned siRNA targeting human MAT2A
(sense sequence: ACACAUUGGAUAUGAUGAUTT)
was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), while
Ubc9 (sense sequence: GGAACUUCUAAAUGAAC
CATT), SUMO-1 (sense sequence: AAGUGAAUAU
AUUAAACUCA), and scrambled control siRNA were
purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). RKO and HepG2
cells were cultured in 6-well plate (0.4×106 cells/well) and
transfected using RNAiMax (5 μL/well) from Invitrogen
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The Bcl-2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid pBS
(Addgene, Cambridge MA), WT and catalytic mutant
MATα2 expression plasmids were transfected into HepG2
and RKO cells (0.4×106 cells/well, 6-well plates) using
the BioT reagent (Bioland Scientific, Paramount, CA).
As an internal control, the pRL4.73 plasmid (Promega,
Madison, WI), which carries a Renilla luciferase gene,
was co-transfected into the cells. The cells were lysed to

some experiments cells were first treated with Ubc9,
MAT2A or SUMO-1 siRNA for 24 hours prior to cotransfection with Bcl-2 promoter construct and MATα2
expression plasmid.

of recombinant MATα2 or sumoylated MATα2 prepared
as described above, at 4°C for 2 hours with rotation.
Pellet agarose was washed five times with incubation
buffer. Finally, Bcl-2/MATα2, Bcl-2/sumoylated-MATα2
complex interactions, Bcl-2 and MATα2 loading control
samples (prior to in vitro sumoylation and complex
interaction) were analyzed by Western blotting using Bcl-2
and MATα2 antibodies.

Protein stability assay and half-life
determination

EMSA and supershift assay
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the
EpiQuik™ Nuclear Extraction Kit I protocol (Epigentek,
Farmingdale, NY). Extracts were subjected to EMSA and
supershift (3 μg MATα2 antibody) using the LightShift®
Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit protocol (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA) and probes as described
(Supplementary Table S1). In other experiments,
recombinant MATα2 (200 ng) was used for EMSA instead
of nuclear extracts and nucleic acids are detected with
SYBR® Green dye (1:10,000) incubating the gels for 20
min at room temperature, and rinsed twice with deionized
H2O. The gels were visualized using UVP ChemiDoc-Itt32
Imager (UVP, Upland, CA).

CHX (5 μg/ml) was added to RKO cells 18
hours after transfection with 2 μg of wild type MATα2pCMV4 or MATα2 sumoylation mutant plasmids per
well. Protein levels were determined at indicated time
points by Western blotting as described above using antiMATα2 antibody. The relative amount of MATα2-DDK
protein was evaluated by densitometry and normalized to
actin. Endogenous and DDK-tagged MATα2 bands were
separately analyzed. Protein half-life was determined for
each experiment using linear regression analysis as we
described [10].

ChIP assay

Seventy percent confluent RKO and HepG2 cells
were treated with 12.5 μM of 5-FU in fresh growth
medium for 24 hours after transfection with 2 μg of wild
type MATα2-pCMV4 or MATα2 sumoylation mutant
plasmids per well. The percentage of apoptotic cells was
examined using Hoechst 33258 staining method as we
described [19].

5-FU treatment in vitro and apoptosis assay

ChIP assays were performed using the EZ-ChIP
kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Sonicated chromatin
immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of antibody against
MATα2 was reverse cross-linked and PCR amplified
for 35 cycles with the following Forward (Fw) and
Reverse (Rev) Bcl-2 P2 promoter primer sequences:
Fw, 5′-GATTCCTGCGGATTGACATTTCT-3′; Rev,
5′-CCAAGAATGCAAAGCACATCCAA-3′.

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical
analysis was performed using ANOVA and Fisher’s
test. For mRNA and protein levels, ratios of genes
and proteins to respective housekeeping densitometric
values were compared. Significance was defined by
p < 0.05.

In vitro sumoylation of MATα2
Recombinant MATα2 (1 μg) was sumoylated in vitro
using SUMOylation kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale,
NY) in a final volume of 10 μl containing 55 mM Tris
(pH 7.5), 5.5 mM MgCl2, 2.2 mM ATP and 5.5 mM
dithiothreitol. Sumoylation reactions were incubated at
37°C for 4 hours, after which proteins were analyzed by
Western blotting with SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 antibodies.
