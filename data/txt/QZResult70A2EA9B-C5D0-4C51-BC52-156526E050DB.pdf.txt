BACKGROUND. Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a genetically distinct sarcoma with a propensity for local recurrence and metastasis despite an
indolent course. To the authors’ knowledge, there are limited data examining
chemotherapy outcomes as a guide to therapeutic decisions for unresectable
disease.

METHODS. The clinical behavior and treatment responses of 87 patients with
EMC who were seen at 2 institutions between 1975 and 2008 were examined.

RESULTS. The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 49.5 years,
with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. For patients presenting without metastases,
37% developed local recurrence (median time of 3.3 years) and 26% developed
distal recurrence (median time of 3.2 years). Approximately 13% of patients presented with metastases. The 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year overall survival rates

was 5.2 months. The best physician-assessed response to chemotherapy was
stable disease for at least 6 months in 25% of patients, stable disease for
<6 months in 41% of patients, and disease progression in 34% of patients. The
estimated progression-free survival rates at 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, and
9 months were 69%, 65%, 40%, and 26%, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS. This retrospective review highlights the poor response rate to
chemotherapy and emphasizes aggressive control of localized disease as the primary approach to management. Although there are biases inherent in retrospective analyses, these data provide a benchmark for time to disease progression for
the study of new agents for the treatment of patients with this diagnosis. Cancer

xtraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a rare soft-tissue
malignancy that is distinguished from other sarcomas by its
unique histology and a characteristic chromosomal translocation,
typically t(9;22)(q22;q12.2), fusing EWSR1 to NR4A3 (genes formerly
termed EWS and CHN, TEC, or NOR1, respectively).1-3 A small proportion of EMC have a different translocation, t(9;17)(q22;q11.2),
which results in a RBP56-NR4A3 fusion gene and neuroendocrine
differentiation in some cases.4 The chromosomal translocations
result in fusion gene products responsible for alterations in cellular
growth and differentiation.5
Histologically, the tumor has a vague resemblance to human
cartilage, but with a marked phenotypic plasticity that overlaps with

other mesenchymal malignancies,6 and an uncertain
histogenesis.7-9 Since its recognition as a distinct
clinicopathologic entity, the debate regarding tumor
behavior has shifted toward an understanding of its
nature as an intermediate-grade rather than a lowgrade neoplasm.10 This idea is substantiated by studies with long median follow-up that demonstrate a
high rate of local tumor recurrence and distant
spread despite a prolonged clinical course.11-13
Currently, the only curative option for EMC is
early wide local resection with or without radiation
for localized disease.13,14 To our knowledge, few published data exist to date examining responses to systemic therapy for disseminated disease.15 We
therefore assembled a retrospective series of patients
from 2 large referral centers to examine treatment
outcomes and progression-free survival (PFS) with
systemic therapy. Understanding that we would find
little activity from chemotherapy, our goal was to
provide a metric for metastatic EMC patients that
can be used as a comparator for studies of new
agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
After obtaining Institutional Review Board permission, 86 patients of EMC were retrieved from the
databases of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York City and the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. Patients were seen and treated at
each institution between 1975 and 2006; approximately two-thirds of patients examined were diagnosed after 1995. Patients with a definite diagnosis of
EMC by expert pathologic review of the primary tumor were included in the study. In situations in
which a clear diagnosis was not established on pathology, confirmation was made by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for
the EWSR1-NR4A3 translocation t(9;22). Data were
censored on March 1, 2008.
Demographics and Statistical Methods
Demographic data examined as part of this retrospective study included patient age at diagnosis,
patient sex, tumor location, and primary tumor size.
Pathology and surgical reports were used to determine the completeness of resection (R0: complete
resection, negative margins; R1, complete macroscopic resection, positive microscopic margins; and
R2, incomplete resection). Estimates of survival with
the endpoints of local, distant, and any recurrence;
metastasis, and overall survival (OS) were determined

by Kaplan-Meier analysis using the date of wide local
excision (WLE) as Time 0, irrespective of previous
procedures. The prognostic significance of sex (male
or female), age (<50 years or 50 years), tumor site
(located in the extremities or in other sites), and tumor size (<5 cm, 5-10 cm, or >10 cm) in terms of
local, distant, and any recurrence was determined
with a univariate analysis using the log-rank test. A
multivariate analysis of local recurrence and metastatic disease in addition to the above factors affecting OS was performed using the Cox proportional
hazards model after a similar univariate analysis.
A response to systemic treatment was judged by
either radiographic (World Health Organization
[WHO] or Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid
Tumors [RECIST]) or clinical evidence of change in
tumor size. PFS was examined as the primary endpoint for treatment with data censored for toxicity.

RESULTS
Clinical Features of Local and Metastatic EMC
Of the 86 evaluable patients, 57 were men and 29
were women, for a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. The
median age at diagnosis was 49.5 years (range, 15-82
years) (Fig. 1). Approximately 50% of the patients (44
of 86 patients) presented between the ages of 41 and
60 years. Approximately 62% had a primary site in
the lower extremities; 17% in the upper extremities;
13% in the abdomen, retroperitoneum, or pelvis; and
8% in other areas (Table 1). The size of the primary
tumor ranged from 1 to 30 cm (median, 6.8 cm) in
patients with documented measurements (n 5 68).
Approximately 87% (76 of 86 patients) of patients
presented with primary localized disease. The median follow-up from the initial date of diagnosis was
3.6 years. A total of 34% of patients were either diag-

nosed with or progressed to metastatic disease. The
first site of metastasis was the lung in 80% of cases
(63% with metastasis confined to the lungs and 17%
with metastasis at other sites concurrent with lung
disease). Other metastatic sites were observed in 20%
of patients. The median survival time from the diagnosis of metastatic disease was 1.7 years.

Treatment Outcomes for Localized Disease
Seventy-six patients presented with primarily localized disease, 73 of whom received subsequent treatment with curative intent. Of these patients, 70%
(n 5 51) had wide local excision only as primary
therapy, whereas 30% (n 5 22 patients) underwent
both wide excision and radiotherapy in the form of
neoadjuvant, intraoperative, or adjuvant therapy. Recurrence rates for surgery with and without radiation
are detailed in Table 2.
For the analysis of recurrence-free survival, recurrence from the date of WLE was used, regardless
of whether patients received radiotherapy (P 5 .79,
Fisher exact test). Local disease recurrence was noted
in 37% of patients (n 5 27) who received primary
therapy with curative intent (surgery with or without
radiation), with a median time to disease recurrence
of 3.3 years. The median local PFS was 7.0 years

(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.4 years-9.6
years). Local recurrence-free survival was 57% at
5 years and 31% at 10 years (Fig. 2A). Patients receiving radiotherapy had a trend toward a higher risk of
distant disease recurrence (P 5 .08, Fisher exact test),
suggesting that patients with more aggressive tumors
were selected for radiotherapy. In a subset of 43
patients in whom there were data regarding quality
of the resection (R0, R1, and R2), only 2 of 24
patients who underwent an R0 resection developed
local disease recurrence, whereas 3 of 12 patients
with an R1 resection and 5 of 7 with an R2 resection
experienced local disease recurrence (P < .01, Fisher
exact test).
Distant disease recurrence was observed in 26%
of patients (n 5 19), with a median time of 3.2 years.
The distant recurrence-free survival rate at 5 years
and 10 years was 71% and 58%, respectively
(Fig. 2B). The median distant time to disease progression was not reached at the time of last followup. Approximately 49% of patients experienced any
form of disease recurrence (n 5 36 patients). The
disease-free survival rate in these patients was 42%
at 5 years and 21% at 10 years (Fig. 2C). The median
time to any disease recurrence was 4.7 years (95%
CI, 4.4 years-5.0 years). By univariate analysis, the

local, distant, and overall recurrence-free survival
rates were not affected by age or sex. An extremity
primary tumor location was found to be a favorable
prognostic factor for local recurrence-free survival.
Extremity and small primary tumor size were found
to be marginally associated with a favorable risk for
any recurrence (Table 3).

Follow-up and OS
Follow-up data were available for all 86 patients
studied, with a median follow-up time of 3.6 years
(range, 0.2 years-24.6 years). At the time of last follow-up, 22 patients were alive with disease, 14 were
dead of disease, and 4 were dead of other causes but
with disease. Approximately 63% of patients were

free of disease after primary therapy with curative
intent (46 of 73 patients). Kaplan-Meier estimates of
OS at 5, 10, and 15 years were 82%, 65%, and 58%,
respectively (Fig. 2D). Adverse prognostic factors
affecting OS that were identified on univariate analysis were size >10 cm (P 5 .005) and the presence of
metastases (P 5 .001). On multivariate analysis, only
presentation with metastatic disease was found to
affect OS (P 5 .005). Median survival after the detection of metastases for the 28 patients with follow-up
data was 17.8 months.

Chemotherapy Outcomes
Twenty-one of 86 EMC patients received a combined
total of 39 courses of chemotherapy: 2 as neoadjuvant therapy, 3 as adjuvant therapy, 2 for local disease recurrence, and 32 for metastatic disease.
Response data were available from 32 of these
courses in 21 patients. Treatments were highly heterogeneous; 25 different regimens were administered,
with doxorubicin-containing regimens comprising
the largest subgroup (Table 4). The remaining regimens were comprised of conventional or experimental agents.
No radiologic (according to RECIST or WHO criteria) complete responses (CRs) or partial responses
(PRs) were noted. For doxorubicin-containing regimens, best objective response was stable disease
(SD) lasting 6 months in 2 patients, SD lasting
<6 months in 5 patients, and progressive disease
(PD) in 3 patients. For the other regimens, best
response was SD lasting 6 months in 6 patients, SD
lasting <6 months in 8 patients, and PD in 8
patients. For all courses of therapy combined, 25%
(8 of 32 patients) of patients had a best result of SD
lasting 6 months, 41% (13 of 32 patients) had a
best result of SD lasting <6 months, and 34% (11 of
32 patietns) had a best response of PD. Time to dis-

months (Kaplan-Meier 95% CI, 3.4 months-7.1 months).

DISCUSSION
EMC is distinguished by a biology that is distinct
from the genetic heterogeneity observed in other
forms of chondrosarcoma.13 The majority of patients
are characterized by translocations that lead to
abnormal gene products. The most common of these
is t(9;22)(q22;q11), resulting in the juxtaposition of
the genes EWSR1 (formerly called EWS) on chromosome 22 and NR4A3 (also termed TEC, NOR1, or
CHN) on chromosome 9.16-18 Variant translocations
have been described in recent years, notably
t(9;17)(q22;q11) coding for NR4A3-TAF15,19-22 and
t(9;15)(q22;q21), encoding NR4A3-TCF12/HTF4.23,24
These fusion products are postulated to modify transcriptional activity and regulate cellular differentia-

tion and growth, leading to tumorigenesis.16-18,25 Ultrastructural studies of EMC have also uncovered evidence of markers of neuroendocrine differentiation7,8
such as class III b-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein-2.9 These findings argue against a
chondrocytic or prechondrocytic origin of this malignancy, and further distinguish EMC as a unique entity among sarcomas.
The results of the current study are consistent
with the demographics of EMC annotated in previous studies, with a predilection for a primary site in
the extremities, and typical presentation during the
fifth and sixth decades of life.12,26,27 Our follow-up
was relatively short compared with other series, perhaps because of our difficulty in confirming diagnoses and finding complete records in patients
treated before 1985, and patients lost to follow-up after successful surgery or death after the development
of metastatic disease. A consistently high rate of local
recurrence has been described for these tumors, ranging from 14% to 64% in some series,10-13,26-28 with
progression to metastatic disease reported in up to
31% of patients.13
The French Federation of Cancer Centers
(FNCLCC) staging system lists EMC as a grade 2/3
tumor29; the reported median survival of <18 months
from the onset of metastasis is consistent with an intermediate-grade to high-grade sarcoma. The only

satisfactory chance of cure of these tumors is surgical intervention in patients with localized disease.14
In a recent multi-institutional study by Kawaguchi
et al,13 the role of WLE despite previous procedures
or disease recurrence was emphasized as a means of
reducing rates of local disease recurrence and
improving OS.
To our knowledge to date, no chemotherapeutic
agent or combination of agents has demonstrated a
durable efficacy against EMC, despite a few reports
of chemotherapeutic responses (Table 5). Patel et al15
observed no objective responses in 10 patients
receiving a median of 4 cycles of therapy with what
were largely doxorubicin-based and dacarbazinebased regimens. Saleh et al11 were similarly unable
to document any significant responses in 7 patients
treated with chemotherapy (in 1 case, a ‘‘slight and
temporary response’’ was observed). McGrory et al10
found that 2 of 6 patients responded to multiagent
chemotherapy for systemic disease (1 PR and 1 CR),
and these patients were followed for up to 6 years
without evidence of PD. Data regarding the agents
used were unavailable. A study by Rubinger et al30
documented a PR to interferon-a-2b with stable residual disease reported to last for 12 months after
the completion of therapy. Given these data, we
believe that EMC has yet to display a consistent
response to any known systemic therapy used for
other soft-tissue sarcomas.
Despite the lack of sufficient evidence of chemotherapeutic efficacy in EMC, recent investigations
into tumor biology have uncovered novel potential
approaches to systemic treatment. One strategy
involves the modulation of pathways involving the
EWSR1-NR4A3 fusion gene.31 Several targets downstream from the translocation protein include SGK1,
a serine-threonine kinase that is up-regulated in
EMC,32 PGA2, a prostaglandin that transactivates the
EWSR1-NR4A3 fusion protein,33 and Six-3, a cofactor
that activates the CHN gene, even in the absence of
a translocation.34 Client proteins of hsp90 include

3370

CANCER

December 15, 2008 / Volume 113 / Number 12

steroid receptors, which are dependent on hsp90 for
maintaining their conformation.35 Because NR4A3 is
a member of this family of proteins, it may be a target for hsp90-directed therapy such as derivatives of
geldanamycin, which is currently in clinical trials.
Gene profiling studies have recently uncovered
an array of diagnostic markers for EMC, the most
common of which include the genes DKK1 (involved
in Wnt signaling), NMB, DNER, CLCN3, and DEF6.36
Other genes found to be overexpressed in EMC compared with other sarcomas highlighted the Wnt and
Myc pathways as possible therapeutic targets, for
which several molecules that interfere with signaling
are currently being developed. Furthermore, in light
of its high levels of expression in the same study,
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma
(PPARG) was identified as another possible therapeutic target for small molecular inhibitors such as thiazolidinediones or O-arylmandelic acid.37
Such hypotheses are ripe for examination in cell
lines transfected with the EWSR1-NR4A3 fusion gene,
and could be examined in multicenter studies of
patients with this rare diagnosis. Two examples of
EMC-directed clinical trials are the study of the kinase inhibitor perifosine and the IGF1R antagonist
antibody R1507 in patients with EMC and other diagnoses by the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through
Collaboration cooperative group (SARC),38,39 the
results of which are anticipated within the next 1 to
2 years. In these and future studies, we hope to see
an improvement in the time to disease progression
and survival data observed in the current study.
