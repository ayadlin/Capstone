(RT) for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer has evolved from an
inpatient 5-day every 21-day regimen to a weekly outpatient regimen. This study
was designed to test for differences in progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity
between the 2 regimens.

METHODS. In all, 77 consecutive patients at a single institution with stage IB2-IV
cervical cancer were included in this analysis (using the International Federation
of Gynecologists and Obstetricians staging system). All patients were treated with
CDDP, external beam RT, and 2 9-Gy high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatments.
Two cohorts were compared: 1) 5-day, patients treated from 1995 to 2001 with
CDDP 20 mg/m2  5 days every 21 days concomitant with RT; 2) weekly, treated
after May 2001 with CDDP 40 mg/m2 weekly concomitant with RT.

RESULTS. In all, 50 patients were treated with the 5-day regimen and 27 patients
with the weekly regimen. There were no significant demographic differences

CONCLUSIONS. Patients who received weekly CDDP have a shorter 3-year PFS. Patients
with advanced-stage cervical cancer who received weekly CDDP had significantly
more acute toxicities. These data should be confirmed in a multiinstitutional, randomized, controlled study. Cancer 2007;109:48–53.  2006 American Cancer Society.

umerous Phase II and randomized controlled trials have reported
a survival advantage using cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemotherapy
regimens concomitant with radiation therapy (RT) for the treatment
of locally advanced cervical cancer.1–5 These prompted a National
Cancer Institute clinical announcement in 1999 recommending the
use of concomitant chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of locally
advanced cervical cancer.6 The beneficial effects of concomitant chemoradiotherapy have recently been verified in a Cochrane Database
meta-analysis of the 19 published trials through 2005.7 However, it
was noted that the survival increase did come at the cost of significant hematologic and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity.
The optimal CDDP-based treatments have evolved since the
early studies in the mid-1980s. Many of the early regimens consist-

ing of CDDP alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluorouracil or
hydroxyurea, were inpatient regimens using CDDP
20 mg/m2 with intravenous (i.v.) hydration for 5
days.1,3,8,9 Because of the ease of weekly dosing and
the lower cost of outpatient administration, there
was a trend to use outpatient weekly CDDP despite
no randomized, controlled comparison trials showing
equivalency to inpatient 5-day regimens.
We have been treating patients with concomitant
CDDP and RT at the Montefiore Medical Center and
Albert Einstein College of Medicine for over 15
years.4,5 Before May 2001 all patients received inpatient CDDP. After May 2001 all patients were treated
with outpatient weekly CDDP.
The primary objective of this study was to identify if there is a difference in the progression-free
survival (PFS) between patients treated with inpatient 5-day CDDP at a dose of 20 mg/m2 for 5 days
compared with those treated with outpatient weekly
CDDP at a dose of 40 mg/m2. The secondary objective was to compare the rates of early and late toxicities between patients who were administered these
2 regimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
The Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein
College of Medicine (MMC/AECOM) computerized
databases were searched to identify all patients with
a diagnosis of cervical cancer. The charts of 389 consecutive patients evaluated and treated from 1995 to
2005 were identified and all identifying information
was removed for analysis. 1995 was chosen as the
start date because that is when we started using
high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy and the RT
treatment planning among all of our patients was
procedurally consistent. Figure 1 summarizes the distribution of the patients. In all, 77 patients with stage
IB2-IV cervical cancer who were treated with CDDP
concomitant with external beam RT (EBRT) in addition to 2 9-Gy HDR brachytherapy insertions with
additional RT boosts as necessary were included in
this analysis. Demographic, clinical/pathologic, treatment, and outcome information was obtained from
the patient medical records, flowsheets, and treatment plans. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.
Treatment Characteristics
All patients received CDDP. Patients who were staged
after January 1995 and before May 2001 were treated
with inpatient CDDP 20 mg/m2 for 5 days every

21 days concomitant with RT. Patients who were
staged after May 2001 received outpatient weekly
CDDP 40 mg/m2 concomitant with RT.
All patients received similar RT dosing by the
Radiation Oncology Department at Montefiore Medical Center consisting of EBRT (median dose 45 Gy) to a
standard whole pelvic field and 2 9-Gy HDR brachytherapy insertions prescribed to point A.10,11 Patients
received radiation boosts as indicated. Radiation
fields, doses, and prescription points were consistent
between both groups, with no significant differences.

Treatment Outcomes
Deaths were identified through our hospital-based
patient-information system, patient charts, and the

50

CANCER January 1, 2007 / Volume 109 / Number 1

Social Security Death Index (http://ssdi.rootsweb.
com/). Chart information was reviewed to ascertain
the cause of death. Follow-up for patients whose
charts had incomplete demographic or follow-up information was performed using a scripted telephone
interview.
Persistent disease was defined as not achieving a
complete clinical response within 8 weeks of completion of RT. Incomplete treatment was defined as: 1)
not completing the prescribed external beam RT
doses, 2) missing any scheduled HDR brachytherapy
insertions, or 3) missing any dose of CDDP other
than the last weekly dose.
Early toxicities were defined as those occurring
within 90 days of completion of therapy and late
toxicities were defined as those occurring after 90
days. Early and late toxicities were graded using
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(NCI-CTC) v. 3.0.

Statistical Analysis
Stage I and II, or early-stage (ES) patients, were combined and stage III and IV, or late-stage (LS) patients,
were combined for analysis. Patients who received
inpatient 5-day CDDP are labeled as 5-DAY and
those who received outpatient weekly CDDP are labeled as WEEKLY. Nadir hemoglobin (Hb) was determined from the lowest of 3 recorded Hb
measurements: 2 weeks after starting EBRT, 2 weeks
after starting chemotherapy, and 3 weeks after starting chemotherapy. Hb <11 g/dL was considered low
hemoglobin concentration and Hb 11 g/dL was
considered normal.
Tests of association between the 5-DAY and
WEEKLY groups were performed using Pearson x2,
Fisher exact test, and Student t-test or nonparametric
equivalents where appropriate. Odds ratios for the
development of early toxicities in the WEEKLY and 5DAY groups were calculated after stratifying by stage.
PFS was defined as recurrence of disease or persistence of disease after completion of treatment.
Actuarial PFS plots were constructed using the
Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, with the log-rank test
applied to detect differences between the 2 treatment
regimens while controlling for stage.
Disease-specific survival (DSS) was defined as
death from a complication of cervical cancer after
completion of treatment. The Mantel-Haenszel method
was used to calculate a combined odds ratio for
WEEKLY treatment after controlling for stage. A Cox
proportional hazards model was constructed to evaluate the independent effect of the regimen on PFS.
Models included stage (ES and LS), completion of
treatment (complete or incomplete), and age. Fol-

low-up time was calculated from the date of clinical
staging to the date last seen or the date of recurrence. All statistical analysis was performed using
STATA 9.1 operating on a Windows XP platform (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). All statistical tests
used a 2-tailed of .05.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the baseline demographic and clinical
information for the 77 patients. Median follow-up
time for the entire cohort was 42 months (range, 4–
120). Median follow-up for the 5-DAY regimen and
WEEKLY regimen were 61 months (range, 4–120) and
28 months (range, 4–50), respectively. There was no
significant difference between the 2 groups for age,
race, histology, body mass index (BMI), or nadir hemoglobin; however, the lack of a statistically significant difference between the groups may be due to
the small number of women in each group. Women
treated with the 5-DAY regimen were more likely to
have LS disease than women treated with the
WEEKLY regimen (48% vs 26%), although this did
not reach statistical significance (P ¼ .06).
Seventy (91%) patients had been seen within 12
months before data collection; 75 of 77 (97.4%) patients achieved clinical remission after treatment.
Two of 77 patients had documented residual disease
at the end of treatment and were categorized as having persistent disease. Ten (20%) of the 5-DAY
women failed treatment, of which 7 (70%) had locor-

egional failure. Nine (33%) of the WEEKLY women
failed treatment, of which 8 (89%) had locoregional
failure. Forty-eight (96%) of the women in the 5-DAY
treatment group completed treatment, whereas only
22 (81%) of the women in the WEEKLY treatment
group completed treatment (P ¼ .05).
A borderline significant difference was found in
the PFS of the 2 chemotherapy regimen groups
(P ¼ .11); however, a post-hoc power analysis indicated
that we had only a 17% power to detect a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups due to the
small sample size. Adjustment for stage alone demonstrated a significant difference in survival between
the 2 chemotherapy regimens (P < .01). Because there
was a disproportionate amount of LS patients in the 5DAY group, the KM survival plots were adjusted for
stage. Figure 2 shows the KM survival plot for the difference in PFS between the 2 different chemotherapy
regimens after adjusting for stage; 3-year PFS for those
treated with the 5-DAY regimen was 90% compared
with 76% in the WEEKLY patients. Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found in the DSS (P
¼ .34), but after adjusting for stage there was a significant difference between the 2 chemotherapy regimens
(P ¼ .05). Figure 3 shows the KM survival plot for the
difference in DSS between the 2 different chemotherapy regimens after adjusting for stage; 3-year DSS for
those treated with the 5-DAY regimen was 92% compared with 85% in the WEEKLY patients.
We constructed a Cox proportional hazards model
adjusting for the clinically relevant risk factors based on
univariate analysis and known clinical risk factors. These
included chemotherapy regimen, stage, age, and completion of treatment. Adjusting for these covariates,
WEEKLY patients had a 3.46 times greater risk of failing
treatment than 5-DAY patients (95% confidence interval

[CI]: 1.25, 9.58). Similarly, patients who received the outpatient WEEKLY regimen had a 2.67 times greater risk of
death from cervical cancer than those who received the
inpatient 5-DAY regimen (95% CI: 0.90, 7.93). Patients
with LS disease had a 5.78 times greater risk of failing
treatment than those with ES disease, as expected (95%
CI: 1.97, 17.01). As the age of the patient increased there
was a reduced risk of treatment failure of 3.7% per year
(P ¼ .07). However, the older the patient the more likely
she was to have an early toxicity (P ¼ .07) and not to
complete treatment (P ¼.13).
Of the 77 patients, 20 (26%) reported early nonhematologic toxicities. Fifteen of these 20 women had GI
toxicity including: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. Other early toxicities included: hemorrhage,
deep vein thrombosis (DVT), disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy (DIC), fever, weight loss, and 1 bowel perforation. Eleven (22%) of 5-DAY compared with 9 (33%)
of the WEEKLY patients had early toxicities. After stratifying by stage, WEEKLY patients with stage 3 and 4 cervical cancer had a 3.43 times greater risk of developing
early toxicity than those treated with the inpatient 5-day
regimen (95% CI: 1.38, 8.52).
Grade 3 or 4 late toxicities occurred in 5 (6%)
patients. Late toxicities included development of a
urethral stricture, 50-lb weight loss, perineal-peritoneal fistula, rectovaginal fistula, diverticular fistula
with abscess, and entero-vesico-peritoneal fistula.
Whereas the WEEKLY regimen had a higher late toxicity rate than the 5-DAY regimen, this did not reach
statistical significance (P ¼ .34).

DISCUSSION
In this retrospective analysis there was a statistically
significant difference in the PFS between those women

52

CANCER January 1, 2007 / Volume 109 / Number 1

with locally advanced cervical cancer who were treated
with inpatient 5-DAY CDDP compared with outpatient
WEEKLY CDDP, specifically, those who were treated
with outpatient WEEKLY CDDP had worse survival.
Also, there were significantly more early toxicities in
stage 3 and 4 patients who were treated with outpatient
WEEKLY CDDP. There were more late toxicities in the
weekly group; however, this did not reach statistical significance due to the small sample size.
Whereas our study demonstrated a decreased risk
of early toxicity in patients with LS disease treated
with the 5-DAY CDDP regimen, this may be due to
the fact that the early toxicities in the 5-DAY group
have been underreported or not well documented
because the patients were already admitted for their
chemotherapy. The vast majority of early toxicities
seen in the WEEKLY patients were GI-related, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration
requiring admission and parenteral treatment. Significant GI-related toxicity in the 5-DAY group may have
been masked by the regular use of inpatient i.v. fluids
and i.v. nausea medications.
There was a significantly lower rate of patients
who completed WEEKLY CDDP compared with those
who completed 5-DAY CDDP. The reason for this is
unclear, but could be attributed to the increased
early toxicities experienced by the WEEKLY group.
Whereas some of the survival difference between the
2 groups may be related to not completing therapy,
there is still a significant difference in PFS even after
controlling for incomplete therapy.
There were a few other observations seen in this
study population. Older patients had less risk of failing treatment. Although this observation may be a
result of the small numbers of older patients in this
population, it may represent the indolent, less aggressive nature of the cervical cancers seen in older
women.12,13 Also, anemia did not affect RT success in
this population, as has been previously reported.14
Controlling for anemia events in the model did not
alter the differences between the 2 groups. This is
probably due to the aggressive use of erythropoietin
and blood transfusions as clinically indicated.
Directly correlating dose delays to survival is a
difficult task to perform in retrospective studies. A delay of a few days may be due to scheduling or patient
convenience, not a clinically meaningful delay and often not documented. The majority of clinically meaningful delays could be due to significant (G3 or G4)
toxicity and/or compliance. Both toxicity and compliance can be interpreted as surrogates for clinically
meaningful delays. When adding toxicity and compliance to the model the survival difference does not
change. Thus, it can be extrapolated that the reason

for the survival difference is probably not due to
significant dose delays in the patients treated with
WEEKLY CDDP.
One of the other limitations of this study is its
retrospective nature. Whereas all attempts were made
to acquire complete and accurate data, retrospective
chart reviews can be affected by recall bias and difficulties with data abstraction from charts; it is particularly difficult to ascertain toxicity data retrospectively.
Only a randomized clinical trial can definitively determine if there was a significant difference between the
2 groups. Accounting for the differences between the
2 chemotherapy groups in stage, an adjusted odds ratio showed a 2.8 times the risk of disease progression
in the WEEKLY group. Using a conservative estimate
of a 2-fold increased risk in disease progression assuming an a of 0.05 and a power of 90% with a 1tailed analysis, we estimate that a randomized trial
would require only 88 patients in each arm.
The use of concomitant chemoradiotherapy with
CDDP inhibits sublethal damage from radiation and
synchronizes the cervical cancer cells to a radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle.15 Without appropriate
pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of peak CDDP levels
in 5-DAY versus WEEKLY CDDP dosing, it is impossible to determine if the reason for the observed difference is due to improved or sustained peak blood
levels of CDDP in the 5-DAY arm. Because it is given
daily for 5 days it can be conjectured that sustained
levels of CDDP are probably present and this sustained level may have improved benefit over a oncea-week CDDP dosing. An increase in dose-intensity
with continuous infusion and duration of infusion
has previously been shown with other chemotherapies such as ifosfamide and topotecan.16 PK analysis
would be helpful in identifying if CDDP blood levels
correlated with the survival difference seen between
the 2 groups.
Our observational study shows a significant
increase in disease progression in women who were
treated with a very commonly used regimen for
locally advanced cervical cancer, weekly outpatient
CDDP. We believe that a prospective, randomized
trial is necessary to determine if a true difference
between these 2 chemotherapy regimens exists.
