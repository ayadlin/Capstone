Abstract
Insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and its ligands
are overexpressed by tumors, mediating proliferation and
protecting against stress-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, there
has been a considerable amount of interest in developing therapeutic agents against IGF-IR. IGF-IR is believed
to be ubiquitously expressed without detectable mutation or
amplification in cancer. We explored the determinants of
cellular response to a humanized anti–IGF-IR antibody. Our
results showed a large variation in IGF-IR levels in rhabdomyosarcoma tumor specimens that were comparable with
those in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. In vitro analysis
revealed a direct and very significant correlation between
elevated IGF-IR levels and antiproliferative effects of the
antibody and defined a receptor number that would predict
sensitivity. Our data further suggested a strong dependence on
IGF-IR for AKT signaling in cells with elevated IGF-IR. The
sensitivity of the high IGF-IR–expressing cells was blocked with
a constitutively active AKT. The extracellular signal-regulated
kinase pathway was not affected by the antibody.
In vivo studies showed that anti–IGF-IR had single-agent
antitumor activity; furthermore, predictions of responses based
on IGF-IR levels were accurate. In vivo biomarker analysis
suggested that h7C10 down-regulated both IGF-IR and p-AKT
initially, concordant with antitumor activity. Subsequent
progression of tumors was associated with reactivation of
p-AKT despite sustained suppression of IGF-IR. These results
identified the first predictive biomarker for anti–IGF-IR
therapies in cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):8039–48]

Introduction
Signaling through insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR)
has been shown to be essential for mammalian growth and
development (1, 2) and stress response and aging (3). In model
systems, numerous studies suggested the roles of IGF-IR in cellular
proliferation, stress response and survival, and transformation of
normal and tumor cells (4–6). This signaling pathway includes the
type I and type II insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I, II) and the
common receptor IGF-IR. Some prior studies have shown increased

expression of IGF ligands in a variety of cancers and have shown
elevated levels of plasma IGF-I associated with increased risk of
developing breast, prostate, colorectal, and prostate cancer (4, 6–8).
IGF-IR is believed to be ubiquitously expressed in normal and
cancer tissues (9–11). Many studies show that the activation of
IGF-IR results in the induction of two signaling cascades involving
AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; ref. 12). The
activation of the AKT pathway is implicated in cell proliferation
and survival (4, 13), and genes in the AKT pathway are frequently
associated with genomic aberrations in a large number of cancers
(14, 15). Many researchers suggest that IGF-IR can be a rational
target for the development of anticancer agents (9, 11, 16–20).
There are reports of an extensive array of investigational agents
against IGF-IR, including small-molecule kinase inhibitors (21–23)
and monoclonal antibodies (24–29). NVP-AEW541 and NVPADW742 (Novartis) were the first described IGF-IR kinase inhibitors
that appeared to have selectivity for IGF-IR in intact cells,
despite the lack of selectivity between IGF-IR and IR with in vitro
inhibitory assays (21, 22). These agents inhibited tumor growth in
animal models (21–23). Unfortunately, the development of these
promising agents has been limited by normal tissue toxicity (30). An
antibody targeting the IGF-IR was first reported over 20 years ago
using the receptor blocking antibody aIR3 (31). aIR3 was shown to
block cell proliferation, survival, and transformation in vitro and
to have antitumor effects in murine models in vivo (32). Recent
studies revealed that the ability to down-regulate IGF-IR could be
an integral component of the antitumor activity of a number of
humanized anti–IGF-IR antibodies (24–29). These antibodies have
the promise of greater selectivity over IR and other related receptors.
Whereas many of the approved targeted agents work by targeting
the ‘‘oncogene addiction’’ of cancer, imatinib works by targeting
chronic myelogenous leukemia with BCR-ABL translocation or GIST
with c-KIT mutation, and trastuzumab works by targeting breast
cancer with HER2 amplification, nearly nothing is known about
the putative selectivity of anti–IGF-IR based therapies. No specific
mutation, translocation, or amplification of IGF-IR in cancer has
been reported to date. Further, no biomarker has been reported to
be associated with response to anti–IGF-IR agents. As some of
the anti-IGF-IR–based investigational therapies move into early
phases of clinical trials, there is an urgent need to understand the
scientific basis for the selective action of these agents. Similarly, it is
very important to identify biomarkers that maybe predictive of
response so that correlative investigations can be implemented at
phase II studies.

common childhood soft tissue sarcoma that constitutes f60%
of the disease. We previously showed high level of expression of
IGF-IR in rhabdomyosarcoma (33) and elevated levels of IGF-II in
rhabdomyosarcoma patient samples and cell lines (34). IGF-IR was
suggested to be important for the growth of this cancer (35), and
a mouse monoclonal antibody against IGF-IR suppressed rhabdomyosarcoma xenograft growth in vivo (36). Because IGF-IR is the
primary target for all anti–IGF-IR therapies and mutation in IGF-IR
has not been found in cancers, we reasoned that variations in the
levels of IGF-IR may define the degree of dependence of the tumor
cells on IGF-IR pathway and therein may predict sensitivity to
antibodies that target IGF-IR.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents. All human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, RD,
Rh1, Rh4, Rh18, Rh28, Rh30, Rh36, CTR, and RMS13, were maintained in
RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Rapamycin
was purchased from LC Laboratories; mock antibody MOPC 21 was from
Sigma; and anti–IGF-IR h7C10 was kindly provided by Merck. The packaging
cell line with a stable constitutively active AKT was kindly provided by
Dr. Sung-Hyeok Hong. Briefly, a myristoylated and constitutively active AKT
was obtained from Upstate. The gene was subsequently cloned into pMSCV
and introduced into package cell PT67 according to the protocols from BD
Biosciences. The viral supernatant from both the AKT and vector cells were
used to infect Rh30 cells, followed by puromycin selection to obtain a stable
population expressing constitutively active AKT.

Immunoblots and electrochemiluminescence assays. Cells were
treated as described and then lysed in RIPA+ buffer complete protease
inhibitor cocktail G and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2 (Sigma).
Protein concentration of lysates was determined by the BCA protein assay
(Pierce). Lysates were separated with Invitrogen NuPage gels and then
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed for the
proteins of interest with specific antibodies followed by a secondary
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and then incubated with SuperSignal
chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). The blots were then exposed to a
Kodak Biomax Light Film. The antibodies against ERK, p-ERK (Thr202/
Tyr204), AKT and p-AKT (Ser473), p-GSK-3h (Ser21/9), and actin were
obtained from CST. The antibody against IGF-IR-h (C20) was from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology.
The samples used for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) were prepared
based on MSD lysate preparation protocol (Meso-Scale Discovery) using
complete lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For
quantitative analysis of phospho-AKT and other pathway proteins, the
duplex t/p-AKT and duplex t/p-EGFR were obtained from Meso Scale
Discovery, used following manufacturer’s instructions and read with Sector
Imager 2400 (MSD). The antibodies for IGF-IR quantitative immunoassay
were purchased from R&D Systems (DuoSet Human Total IGF-IR, DYC305)
and adapted to the ECL platform. Briefly, 5 AL/well of 36 Ag/mL anti–IGF-IR
antibody was coated in coating buffer (0.015% Triton X-100 in PBS)
overnight at 4jC. The next day, after blocking with 3% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in blocking buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20], 25 AL cell lysates (1 mg/mL) were added and
incubated at room temperature with shaking for 2 h. After washing, 25 AL/
well of 400 ng/mL biotin–anti–IGF-IR detection antibody was added,

followed by 1 h incubation. For detection, 25 AL/well of 1 Ag/mL SULFOTAG streptavidin (MSD) was added and incubated for 1 h, followed by
detection with MSD read buffer. IGF-IR protein amount was determined
with a recombinant IGF-IR from R&D Systems (104 kDa excluding
glycosylation). EGFR and duplex t/p-AKT assays were performed with
MSD kits. Lysates of A431 cells were used as the standard for EGFR
quantification at 2 million EGFR per cell.
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR. RNA was prepared with TRIzol
per the manufacturer’s protocol. mRNA was purified via RNeasy mini spin
columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA
was quantified using a NanoDrop (ND-1000) spectrophotometer.
cDNA was prepared using Superscript III kit (Invitrogen) and
quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed using QuantiTect SYBR
Green PCR kit (Qiagen) on a Bio-Rad iCycler. Twenty nanograms of cDNA
were used in each 25 AL qPCR reaction. The relative levels of IGF-IR
expression were determined using two independent primer sets: IGF-IR F1/
R1 GCCAACACTGGTCATCATGGAACT and ATCTTCGGCTACCATGCAATTCCG; IGF-IR F2/R2 ACTATTACCGGAAAGGAGGGAAAGGG and
TGTCAGGACAGTTGTCTGGCTTGT. Each primer set was validated and a
temperature gradient was performed to establish 60jC as the optimal
annealing temperature for PCR amplification. PCR amplification was
carried out per the manufacturer’s protocols and the C t values obtained
were normalized to h-glucuronidase (h-actin and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase were also used as housekeeping controls). The
primers for h-glucuronidase were as follows: HUMGLCB-F1/R1 GAAAATACGTGGTTGGAGAGCTCA and TTGTCTCTGCCGAGTGAAGAT.
Cell viability and clonogenic assays. For ATP-based cell proliferation
assay, cells were plated into white 96-well cell culture plates (Nunc) at a
density of 2,000 to 10,000 per well for growth inhibition analysis. After
24 h of incubation, drugs were added to the cells in triplicate. At the
indicated time, ATPLite assay was performed based on the manufacturer’s
protocol (Perkin-Elmer) and recorded with a Victor 3 plate reader
(Perkin-Elmer). All experiments were performed in triplicate to determine
dose responses. At least three repetitive experiments were performed for
each cell-drug combination, as well as drug dose studies. For clonogenic
assay, 500 cells were plated per well into 6-well plates in triplicates. The
following day, h7C10 was added to 10 Ag/mL and the cells were incubated
further for 2 wk with weekly medium change. The cells were then fixed with
3% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 30 min. All
clonogenic experiments are reproduced.

Human tissues and animal studies. Anonymous human rhabdomyosarcoma tumor and control skeletal muscle tissues were obtained from
patients at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Animal protocol was
approved by the NCI Animal Care and Use Committee. Female 4- to
6-wk-old severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories. Two million rhabdomyosarcoma cells were
injected orthotopically into the gastrocnemius muscle of the left hind leg.
After 1 wk, mice were randomized to treatment groups of 10 mice: DMSO
control, single-agent h7C10, single-agent rapamycin, and h7C10 in
combination with rapamycin. The mice were treated with 250 Ag h7C10
twice per week, 5 mg/kg rapamycin thrice per week, or 100 AL DMSO
diluted to 2% in saline administered i.p. Treatment of all groups was
continued until the mice were sacrificed. In the pharmacodynamic
experiments, tumor-bearing mice were treated with a single dose of
h7C10 by i.p. injection and sacrificed 1, 3, and 5 d after treatment. Four mice
were sacrificed at each time point, and four tumor-bearing mice were
sacrificed without receiving any h7C10. In vivo images were obtained with
an imaging system from Xenogen with Rh30-luciferase cells. The diameter
was measured twice per week with calipers; when the maximal tumor
diameter was measured to be 2 cm, the mice were sacrificed. The tumors
were snap frozen and stored at 80jC.
For protein analysis, tissue lysates were made with complete MSD
lysis buffer with Matrix D beads (Bio 101) in FastPrep FP120 instrument
(Perkin-Elmer) four times (30 s each time at 4jC). Lysates were centrifuged
and protein concentration was determined with the BCA kit and
normalized for subsequent ECL analysis.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism
(GraphPad). Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Pearson
correlation analysis was performed with Prism.

Results
The growth-inhibitory activity of anti–IGF-IR antibody
is highly correlated with the levels of IGF-IR in rhabdomyosarcoma. We screened a group of rhabdomyosarcoma tumors
from patients and observed that 5 of 9 tumors had significantly
elevated IGF-IR levels when compared with that in normal
skeletal muscle using a recombinant IGF-IR as the standard
(Fig. 1A and B). This high and diverse level of expression of
IGF-IR (nearly 50-fold) in rhabdomyosarcoma was not expected.

treated with 10 Ag/mL anti–IGF-IR antibody h7C10 for 24 h. The cell lysates were analyzed for total IGF-IR via an ECL immunoassay. D, the cell lysates from C were
analyzed with immunoblots against t/p-EKR and t/p-AKT. Further quantitative ECL analysis of p-AKT following h7C10 treatment was performed and the relative
levels of p-AKT were shown in a bar chart. Resistant Rh1 cells: ctrl, 1; h7C10, 0.75. Sensitive Rh30 cells: ctrl, 26; Rh30, 4.2.

A similar pattern of IGF-IR expression was also seen in
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (Fig. 1A). It is important to note
that quantitative assessment of IGF-IR in patient samples and cell
lines was performed using a novel sandwich immunoassay (ECL),
as it provides the sensitivity (f1 pg), accuracy, reproducibility,
and absolute quantification by using a recombinant IGF-IR
standard (Fig. 1B). The result on IGF-IR quantification from
ECL was further validated by qPCR (Fig. 1C) and Western blot

analysis with a different antibody against IGF-IR (Fig. 1D) on
selected rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines with high, medium, and
low IGF-IR. Strong agreement on both mRNA and protein levels
in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines were seen with all three types of
assays. Thus, our results showed a significant variation in IGF-IR
in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and tumors, and ECL assay on
IGF-IR provided specific and accurate quantification of the
protein.

Elevated IGF-IR Predicts Anti–IGF-IR Response

We next asked whether the differences in IGF-IR expression in
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines would predict their sensitivity to a
humanized antibody h7C10 against IGF-IR. The h7C10 was shown
to inhibit IGF-I–mediated activation of IGF-IR and to have singleagent activity in xenograft models (27). Previous studies with
humanized anti–IGF-IR antibodies were performed in serum-free
conditions or in low-serum conditions with IGF-I supplementation
(25, 27, 28). Given concerns with biological relevance of such
conditions, we assessed the effects of h7C10 against rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines grown in 10% FBS. Significant h7C10-mediated
growth-inhibitory effects were seen in selected cell lines. Pearson
correlation analysis revealed a highly significant correlation
between growth-inhibitory effects of h7C10 and the levels of
IGF-IR in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (Fig. 2A). Rh4 and CTR
are the most sensitive cell lines, expressing the highest levels of
IGF-IR; RD, Rh30, and RMS13 have medium level IGF-IR and are
modestly sensitive; whereas Rh1, Rh18, and Rh36 are resistant to
h7C10, expressing the lowest levels of IGF-IR. The h7C10 is
extremely potent in inhibiting the proliferation of sensitive Rh4
cells with an IC50 of 7 ng/mL or 60 pmol/L; yet, it is inactive with
resistant Rh18 cells at 10 Ag/mL (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the effect
is highly specific. The growth-inhibitory effects of the IGF-IR
antibody was further validated with clonogenic assay in which
h7C10 had minimal effects on low IGF-IR–expressing cells (Rh18),
significant inhibition on medium IGF-IR–expressing cells (Rh30),
and complete inhibition in cells expressing high IGF-IR (Rh4;
Fig. 2C). Thus, our results suggest a strong, highly specific, and
positive correlation between the level of IGF-IR and in vitro antiproliferative activity of h7C10 in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.

Rhabdomyosarcoma cells with elevated IGF-IR require the
receptor for maintaining high steady-state AKT signaling. We
next sought to define the mechanisms of the growth-inhibitory
response of rhabdomyosarcoma cells to h7C10. We determined
the activation status of phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and phospho-ERK
(p-ERK) as markers of AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway activities in these cells in 10% serum. There was close
agreement between basal levels of IGF-IR and p-AKT among the
cell lines (Fig. 3A and B). At <3,000 IGF-IR molecules per cell,
the AKT pathway is minimally active. EGFR levels were also
determined by ECL and calibrated against EGFR in A431 cells
(2  106 receptors per cell; ref. 37). There was no concordance
between IGF-IR and p-ERK (Fig. 3A and B). Rather, EGFR was
better correlated with p-ERK. Thus, IGF-IR levels are specifically
correlative with basal p-AKT.
To determine if IGF-IR is required to maintain p-AKT in
rhabdomyosarcoma, the cells were treated with the anti–IGF-IR
antibody. h7C10 treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in IGF-IR
(Fig. 3C), likely mediated through receptor internalization (26).
Although h7C10 had no detectable effect on p-ERK, it significantly
down-regulated p-AKT in cell lines with high IGF-IR in the
presence of complete medium (Fig. 3D). ECL results further
showed a 6-fold reduction of p-AKT in sensitive Rh30 (20K IGF-IR
per cell), compared with a 30% reduction of p-AKT in resistant Rh1
(2.6K IGF-IR per cell) with low steady-state p-AKT (Fig. 3D). The
activation of the AKT pathway was implicated in cell proliferation
and survival (4, 13) and associated with genomic aberrations in a
large number of cancers (14, 15). Our results suggested that IGF-IR
was primarily responsible for maintaining high steady-state

activation of AKT in rhabdomyosarcoma cells expressing elevated
IGF-IR, thus demonstrating a cellular dependence on IGF-IR for
AKT signaling.
Constitutively active AKT in part circumvents the growthinhibitory effect of IGF-IR antibody in sensitive rhabdomyosarcoma cells. To causally link p-AKT pathway with the
growth-inhibitory activity of h7C10 in rhabdomyosarcoma
cells, we expressed a constitutively active (CA) myristoylated
AKT1 with 1 to 11 amino acids of avian c-src at the 5¶ end and a
26-amino-acid Myc-His tag at the 3¶ end in sensitive Rh30 cells.
Western blot indicated the expression of slow migrating CA-AKT
protein at a substantially lower level than the endogenous AKT
(t-AKT; Fig. 4A). The CA-AKT was hyperphosphorylated and
appeared to lead to the hypophosphorylation of endogenous AKT
(p-AKT; Fig. 4A). The expression of CA-AKT rendered the Rh30
cells resistant to h7C10-mediated inhibition of p-AKT and its
downstream target p-GSK3h (Fig. 4A). When the cells were

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

examined in short-term growth assays, although both cells grew
at a similar rate without the antibody, the Rh30-CA-AKT cells were
more resistant to h7C10 than Rh30-v-ctrl (Fig. 4B and C). Longterm clonogenic assay confirmed that CA-AKT resulted in a partial
resistance to h7C10 (Fig. 4D). In summary, the results suggested
that the constitutively active AKT, when expressed at a low level,
was able to prevent h7C10-mediated inhibition of AKT signaling
and partially rescued the growth-inhibitory effects of h7C10 on
rhabdomyosarcoma cells.
In vivo selectivity of antitumor activity for the IGF-IR
antibody in rhabdomyosarcoma cells is correlated with
elevated IGF-IR. To examine the in vivo activity of h7C10, cell
line RD was orthotropically injected to the gastrocnemius muscle
in SCID mice. After 1 week, groups of 10 mice were treated with
placebo or h7C10 continuously with tumors measured twice
weekly. The results indicated that h7C10 significantly inhibited
RD tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 5A). A similar antitumor activity

was also observed in a second rhabdomyosarcoma xenograft model
with the Rh30 cell line (Fig. 6A and B). As predicted by in vitro
studies, no significant antitumor effect was seen in low IGF-IR
Rh18 cells following h7C10 treatment (Fig. 5B). Thus, the data
indicate that anti–IGF-IR antibody has selective single-agent
antitumor activity against rhabdomyosarcoma cells expressing
elevated IGF-IR.
IGF-IR is required for maintaining high AKT signaling
in vivo. We next conducted biomarker analysis in rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts treated with h7C10. Previous studies showed that
IGF-IR antibody treatment resulted in a rapid reduction of IGF-IR
(26–29); however, there was no report on the effect on p-AKT with
these antibodies in vivo. We analyzed IGF-IR and p-AKT in both RD

and Rh30 xenografts. The results with RD xenografts showed downregulation of IGF-IR and an inhibition of p-AKT after 1, 3, and 5
days of h7C10 treatment (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the AKT pathway
was inhibited with anti–IGF-IR treatment in vivo. In comparison,
the levels of t-AKT were minimally affected by h7C10 (Fig. 5C).
Similar reductions of both IGF-IR and p-AKT were reproduced with
Rh30 xenograft after 5 days of h7C10 treatment (Fig. 6C). Thus,
both IGF-IR and p-AKT may be used as pharmacodynamic markers
to assess the effects of anti–IGF-IR therapy in rhabdomyosarcoma.
More importantly, rhabdomyosarcoma cells with high IGF-IR are
addicted to the elevated receptor for maintaining their AKT
activation in vivo and as such can be effectively modulated with
anti–IGF-IR therapy.

Cancer Research

Long-term assessment of tumor growth in the xenografts
showed that, despite a significant delay in tumor growth with
h7C10 treatment, all tumors eventually escaped the inhibition of
anti–IGF-IR and grew with similar growth curves as control groups
for both RD and Rh30 xenografts (Figs. 5A and 6A). These parallel
rates of tumor growth, following a lag, suggested the acquisition of
resistance during continuous h7C10 exposure. We reexamined
tumor biomarkers in the escaping rhabdomyosarcoma tumors
using tumors collected at the end of the study. In tumors treated
with h7C10, there was sustained down-regulation of IGF-IR in RD
cells even when RD xenografts were no longer growth inhibited by
h7C10 (Fig. 5D). In contrast, p-AKT was not inhibited by h7C10,
suggesting the uncoupling of IGF-IR down-regulation and p-AKT
inhibition in RD xenograft. This finding was again reproduced in
Rh30 treated with h7C10 (Fig. 6D). Examination of tumor
specimens revealed no difference in both total and p-EGFR levels
or in the level of PTEN (data not shown) with pretreatment and
posttreatment samples. Further studies are needed to define the
mechanism of p-AKT reactivation following h7C10 therapy.
Anti–IGF-IR antibody cooperates with rapamycin against
rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts. Because the resistance appeared
to be associated with reactivation of AKT, we asked whether
the combination of h7C10 and rapamycin, which targets the
IGF-IR-AKT axis downstream of AKT, would prevent this escape in
tumor control. Rapamycin had a very small single-agent effect and
minimal combinatory effect with h7C10 on Rh30 xenograft early on
(Fig. 6A and B). However, the combinatory antitumor effect
became apparent when the h7C10-treated arm started to grow
and the combination resulted in more sustained antitumor effect
(Fig. 6A). Biomarker analysis of tumors revealed elevated p-AKT
in the rapamycin arm; the addition of h7C10 with rapamycin
led to reduced p-AKT to a level comparable with that of h7C10
alone (Fig. 6D). This result is in agreement with our previous
in vitro data that rapamycin treatment leads to elevated p-AKT via
a putative IGF-IR–dependent pathway (38). Accordingly, the
combination of IGF-IR suppression by h7C10 and downstream
targeting of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) results in a
dual benefit of preventing tumor escape seen after h7C10
treatment alone, presumably by mTOR inhibition downstream
of AKT and limiting the potential problem of mTOR-induced
up-regulation of AKT.

Discussion
The success of clinical development of molecular targeting
agents depends on the identification of susceptible patients in
which the targets are absolutely required for tumor pathogenesis
and progression. No such information is currently available for
anti-IGF-IR–based investigational therapies. In this study, we
provide for the first time both in vitro and in vivo data suggesting
that the expression level of IGF-IR in rhabdomyosarcoma cells
predicts the response to IGF-IR antibodies: minimal growth
inhibition for rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines with <3,000 receptors
per cell and maximal inhibition for those with >30,000 receptors
per cell. The clinical relevance of these findings is supported by the
demonstration of a similar diversity of IGF-IR levels in rhabdomyosarcoma patient tumors. Mechanistic and biomarker studies
suggest a cellular addiction in rhabdomyosarcoma cells expressing
high IGF-IR, in which 80% to 90% of AKT signaling depends on
elevated IGF-IR, both in vitro and in vivo. Further, AKT pathway
modulation is necessary for the activity of anti–IGF-IR, as
rhabdomyosarcoma cells expressing constitutively activated AKT

are more resistant. The escape from initially effective single-agent
IGF-IR therapy in rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts appears to be
mediated in part by reactivation of AKT signaling despite sustained
suppression of IGF-IR levels during continuous h7C10 therapy.
Finally, the late escape from single-agent h7C10 treatment is
blocked by the combination therapy of the IGF-IR antibody and the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Collectively, our results provide the
scientific basis and detection methods to enable clinical correlative
studies that may define responders in rhabdomyosarcoma and
perhaps a few other sarcoma patients treated with IGF-IR
antibodies; they also provide a framework to consider appropriate
drug combinations.
We did not find evidence of ERK pathway inhibition in
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines treated with h7C10. It is important
to note that our studies were conducted in the presence of
complete medium, without depriving cells of any other growth
factor. Previous studies in cancer cells have indicated that
IGF-IR could be involved in the activation of ERK pathway and
anti–IGF-IR antibodies inhibited IGF-induced activation of
p-ERK under conditions of serum starvation (25, 28, 29). In our
studies, the levels of IGF-IR did not correlate with p-ERK. In Rh4
cells where the highest level of IGF-IR was observed, the p-ERK
level was rather low. Interestingly, the p-ERK levels were better
correlated with that of EGFR, suggesting distinct pathways for
activating either AKT or ERK. Based on this, it is reasonable to
consider the combination of anti–IGF-IR and anti-EGFR in
rhabdomyosarcoma. Recent studies in a lung cancer xenograft
model indicated that the combination of anti–IGF-IR and antiEGFR reduced tumor growth more than either agent alone (27).
Consistent with our in vitro results, the in vivo pharmacodynamic marker analysis showed that h7C10 was capable of
down-regulating IGF-IR and initially inhibiting AKT pathway in
cells with elevated IGF-IR. Our data also showed an 8-fold
reduction of IGF-IR after 5 days of treatment and 6-fold reduction
of IGF-IR at the end of h7C10 treatment in Rh30 tumors, indicating
that the effects of the antibody in down-regulating IGF-IR was
durable. Similarly, h7C10 led to significant down-regulation of
IGF-IR in the RD xenograft model immediately following the
initiation of h7C10 treatment and at the end of study. Thus, the
anti–IGF-IR antibody leads to the sustained down-regulation of
IGF-IR in tumors in both in vivo models and the IGF-IR level is
a reliable biomarker for exposure to anti–IGF-IR therapy. In
comparison, h7C10 resulted in an initial inhibition of p-AKT
in both xenograft models, in concordance with the inhibition
of tumor growth. The p-AKT levels eventually recovered after
tumors resumed growth in the presence of h7C10. There could
be many explanations that may account for the uncoupling of
IGF-IR–mediated AKT regulation: an alternative receptor, an
activating mutation or altered expression of key genes in the
AKT pathway, or the removal of a negative regulator of the AKT
pathway. Our studies revealed that neither PTEN nor t/p-EGFR
levels (not shown) was responsible for this AKT reactivation.
Further work is required to understand how rhabdomyosarcoma
cells become independent of IGF-IR for AKT signaling.
To begin addressing the problem of single-agent resistance to
h7C10 and the uncoupling of IGF-IR inhibition with p-AKT seen in
resistant tumors in vivo, we considered the opportunity to avert the
effects of p-AKT uncoupling by targeting the downstream mTOR.
Rapamycin is a highly specific inhibitor of protein kinase target of
rapamycin (mTOR), and a rapamycin analogue was recently
approved for treating advanced kidney cancer. mTOR regulates

Elevated IGF-IR Predicts Anti–IGF-IR Response

protein homeostasis via the ribosomal S6 kinase and the eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (39, 40). In addition, our
previous in vitro studies revealed rapamycin-induced feedback
activation of AKT in rhabdomyosarcoma cells that was dependent
on IGF-IR, and the combination of rapamycin and h7C10 had a
small additional benefit in vitro (38). In this study, we showed that
the combination of IGF-IR and mTOR inhibition provided
significant benefit against rhabdomyosarcoma when compared
with either agent alone in vivo. The analysis of p-AKT in tumors
taken from the animals at the end of the study showed that
rapamycin induced p-AKT and h7C10 appeared to inhibit such
induction, agreeing with our previous cell culture data (38).
Rapamycin is a well-tolerated agent and may have potential against
a broader range of cancers. Our results suggest that one may
achieve improved antitumor activity with the combination of
rapamycin and an IGF-IR antibody by targeting two steps of an
integrated receptor-AKT-mTOR pathway.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is one of the
most frequently mutated pathways in many cancers where
mutations in PI3KCA, PTEN, and AKT1 are common (14, 15).
By using rhabdomyosarcoma as a model that is largely free from
mutation of the above genes, we showed that the antiproliferative
effect of an IGF-IR antibody could be partially circumvented
with a modest expression of a constitutively active AKT gene.
Such a finding might suggest that in cancers with activating
mutations of the genes in the AKT pathway, the effects of an
anti–IGF-IR antibody could be compromised. Thus, it would be
useful to carry out mutational analysis of PI3KCA, PTEN, and
AKT1 in clinical trials with an anti–IGF-IR therapy. Another
interesting observation was that the expression of a low level
of constitutively active AKT resulted in significant inhibition of
the endogenous AKT activity (Fig. 4A), giving a constant level of
p-AKT, suggesting yet another putative autofeedback regulation
of p-AKT. Although much is known about IGF-IR or receptormediated AKT activation, there is little information on such
feedback regulation. As there are many inhibitors targeting
IGF-IR, PI3K, and AKT in early stages of drug development, the

understanding of such a feedback regulation could prove to be
useful. We are currently pursuing this line of investigation.
In summary, our results point to a cellular dependence of the
cancer cells on elevated IGF-IR receptor for activated AKT pathway
and cell proliferation in rhabdomyosarcoma. Our results suggest
that the elevated levels of IGF-IR may be predictive of anti–IGF-IR
response: The antiproliferative and antitumor response was highly
correlated with IGF-IR level in vitro and in vivo; rhabdomyosarcoma with elevated IGF-IR had high p-AKT that was primarily
dependent on IGF-IR signaling in vitro and in vivo; the expression
of a constitutively active AKT circumvented the inhibitory effects of
anti–IGF-IR; and, whereas the anti–IGF-IR antibody was capable of
down-regulating IGF-IR and p-AKT initially in vivo, the downregulation of IGF-IR was uncoupled from inhibiting p-AKT when
tumors became resistant to the antibody, which provided a
rationale for a combination with rapamycin in producing a lasting
therapeutic effect. Our study may provide the scientific basis
and the technical know-how for future clinical correlative studies
to assess the value of IGF-IR levels as a predictor of response
to anti–IGF-IR therapies.
