Abstract
The phytochemical resveratrol contained in red grapes has
been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth, in part,
through its antioxidant activity. Muscadine grapes contain
unique phytochemical constituents compared with other
grapes and are potentially a source for novel compounds
with antitumor activities. We compared the antitumor
activities of muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE), which we
show contains no resveratrol, with that of resveratrol using
primary cultures of normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC)
and the prostate cancer cell lines RWPE-1, WPE1-NA22, WPE1NB14, and WPE1-NB26, representing different stages of
prostate cancer progression. MSKE significantly inhibited
tumor cell growth in all transformed prostate cancer cell
lines but not PrEC cells. Prostate tumor cell lines, but not
PrEC cells, exhibited high rates of apoptosis in response to
MSKE through targeting of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–
Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase survival pathways.
The reduction in Akt activity by MSKE is mediated through a
reduction in Akt transcription, enhanced proteosome degradation of Akt, and altered levels of DJ-1, a known regulator of
PTEN. In contrast to MSKE, resveratrol did not induce
apoptosis in this model but arrested cells at the G1-S phase
transition of the cell cycle associated with increased expression
of p21 and decreased expression of cyclin D1 and cyclindependent kinase 4 proteins. These results show that MSKE
and resveratrol target distinct pathways to inhibit prostate
cancer cell growth in this system and that the unique properties of MSKE suggest that it may be an important source for
further development of chemopreventive or therapeutic agents
against prostate cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8396–405]

Introduction
Epidemiologic evidence strongly suggests that a diet rich in
fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of developing
many types of cancers, including prostate cancer (1). Because such
diets are rich sources of phytochemicals, it has been suggested that

the relatively low risk of developing prostate cancer among Asian
men may be attributed in part to the high consumption of
phytochemicals (2, 3). Therefore, a more complete understanding
of the molecular mechanisms, through which phytochemicals act
on cellular processes involved in prostate cancer progression, could
lead to improved use of such compounds for the prevention or
treatment of prostate cancer.
Resveratrol, a phytoalexin produced in a wide variety of plants
(including grapes, peanuts, and mulberries) in response to stress,
injury, UV irradiation, and fungal infection (4), has been shown to
inhibit growth of several types of cancer. For instance, resveratrol
inhibits the growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (5), the
pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and AsPC-1, and Caco-2, a
colon cancer cell line (6). Hsieh and Wu showed that resveratrol
inhibited growth and the G1-S cell cycle transition in LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cells, increased apoptosis, and lowered both
intracellular and secreted prostate specific antigen without
affecting the expression of androgen receptor in the LNCaP
prostate cells (7). These studies support the concept of developing
phytochemicals for anticancer applications.
Muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia) is a type of grape distinct
from the more common red grapes used to produce red wines, a
major source of resveratrol. Muscadine grapes are native to
Southeastern United States and can be found growing wild from
Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico and westward from Missouri to
Texas (8). Interestingly, the phytochemical constituents of muscadine grapes differ from most other grape varieties in that they
contain a predominance of anthocyanin 3,5-diglucosides, ellagic
acid, and ellagic acid precursors (9). Anthocyanins produce the red
and purple colors of the grapes, have strong antioxidant activity
(10), and show antitumor activities by blocking carcinogen-induced
DNA adduct formation (11), inhibiting DNA synthesis in breast
cancer cells (12), and retarding blood vessel growth in some tumors
(13). Moreover, aqueous extracts of the whole muscadine berry
have been shown to inhibit the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9), enzymes involved in tumor
metastases (14). Importantly, no known toxicities that have been
reported to date are related to products of muscadine grapes.
Although these previous studies suggest that anthocyanins, which
are constituents of the muscadine grape, may suppress tumorigenesis, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been
well elucidated.
In this study, we show that muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE)
does not contain significant amounts of resveratrol and that the
major components of MSKE are different from those in muscadine
grape seed extract (MSEE), which has also been studied for
antitumor activities (15). Using a well-characterized series of
transformed human prostate cancer epithelial cell lines that

Inhibition of Prostate Cancer Growth

represent different stages of prostate cancer progression (16), we
show that MSKE significantly inhibits growth of transformed, but
not normal, prostate cells, primarily through the induction of
apoptosis by down-regulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)–Akt survival pathway. In contrast, resveratrol seems to act
in this system by inducing cell cycle arrest through modulation of
the cell cycle regulators p21, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), and
cyclin D1. These results show that MSKE has potent proapoptotic
antitumor activities that differ from the effects of resveratrol
shown in this system, suggesting that MSKE warrants further
development as a potential chemopreventive or therapeutic agent.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and preparation of MSKE. Resveratrol, DMSO, propidium
iodide, and Z-leu-leu-leu-al (MG132 proteosome degradation inhibitor)
were purchased from the Sigma Chemical. Dried and pulverized muscadine
grape skin was obtained from Muscadine Products Corporation. The
muscadine skin powder was prepared from the Ison cultivar, a purpleskinned variety. Similarly, dried and ground muscadine ground seeds from
the Ison variety were used for the muscadine seed extract. A single, large
preparation of MSKE was used for all experiments in this study.
Polyphenolic compounds from the dried and pulverized muscadine grape
skin were extracted with 50% ethanol/water at a nominal ratio of 9:1 (v/w)
by stirring with a magnetic stir bar for 1 h at room temperature. The slurry
was allowed to settle for 24 h, and the supernatant was passed through a
0.2 Amol/L membrane filter funnel (Nalgene) and collected under a vacuum.
Reagents. The antibodies used in this study were as follows: Akt,
phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated GSK-3h, phosphorylated FKHR,
phosphorylated PDK1, PI3K-p85, phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), ERK, phosphorylated p38, p38 (all from Cell
Signaling), androgen receptor, p21, p27 (all from Santa Cruz), cyclin D1,
Cdk2 (Clone 2B6), Cdk4 (Clone DCs-35), cyclin E (Clone HE12; all from
NeoMarkers), actin (Chemicon), DJ-1 (Stressgen KAM-SA100).
Culture of human prostate epithelial cell lines. The development of
the cell lines RWPE-1 and its N-methyl-N-nitrosourea–derived cell lines
(WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, and WPE1-NB26) were originally described by
the laboratory of Muktar Webber (16). The RWPE-1 cell line was
immortalized by human papillomavirus 18, and sublines were further
transformed with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea to produce the additional
lineages of prostate tumor cell lines: RWPE-1 is nontumorigenic when
injected into mice; WPE1-NA22 cells form tumors with a relatively low
growth rate; WPE1-NB14 cells are highly tumorigenic but not highly
metastatic; and WPE1-NB26 cells are highly metastatic. Cells were
cultured in complete KSFM containing 50 Ag/mL bovine pituitary extract
(BPE), 5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 1% antibiotics
(penicillin 100 units/mL, streptomycin 100 Ag/mL; Invitrogen). PrEC
normal prostate cells were grown according to the manufacturer’s
directions in PrEGM medium (Clonetics). LnCaP and Du-145 prostate
cancer cell lines were grown as previously described. Cells were passaged
using trypsin/EDTA and trypsin neutralizing solution (Clonetics). Cultured
cells were maintained in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at
37jC. The cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss)
using Spot Basic imaging software.
Recovery of transresveratrol by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis. To exclude the possibility that MSKE contained significant
amounts of resveratrol, the amount of resveratrol contained in MSKE was
determined and compared with that of MSEE. Extracts were prepared as
described above. But after ethanol extraction, the slurry was allowed to
settle and the supernatant was decanted off into a Buchner filter funnel
containing a glass fiber filter. The filtrate was collected under vacuum
followed by a second filtration through a cellulose fiber filter. Before
analysis, an aliquot of extract was passed through a 0.45-Am nylon
membrane filter using a syringe, then dried using vacuum centrifugation.
The resulting residue was redissolved in 10% acetonitrile/water. Extracts
were stored at 4jC.

Analysis was carried out using an Agilent Technologies series 1100
Capillary LC/MSD-Trap equipped with a binary pump, online degasser,
diode array UV detector with 500-nL flow cell, thermostated microautosampler, and ion trap mass spectrometer. Separation was accomplished by reversed-phase chromatography using a 150 mm  0.5 mm ID
microcolumn packed with 5-Am Beta-Basic C18 stationary phase obtained
from Thermo. The mobile phase used was composed of 0.1% formic acid in
water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile delivered at 25 AL/min as a linear
gradient from 10% acetonitrile for 1 min, increased to 50% over 19 min and
then increased to 80% over 5 min for a total runtime of 25 min. Autosampler
variables included an injection volume of 5 AL and a sample tray
temperature of 4jC. The UV detector was set to monitor the k max for
transresveratrol at 306 nm to provide maximum sensitivity for quantification. Peak identity was confirmed using mass spectrometric detection of the
deprotonated molecular ion at 227.1 m/z. The MS was operated in negative
ion mode using electrospray ionization.
Resveratrol was identified by comparing the retention time of the
standard compound to the sample and by correlation to the extracted ion
chromatogram for 227.1 m/z from the mass spectrometry signal output.
Resveratrol (5 Ag/mL) was also added to MSKE as a positive control, and
the sample peak was acquired under the same high-pressure liquid
chromatography (HPLC) conditions as mentioned above. Quantification
was accomplished by applying the peak area from the sample chromatogram obtained from UV detection to a calibration curve generated using
standard solutions from 0.1 to 50 Ag/mL. The limit of quantification was
equivalent to 1 Ag/g dry weight of skin or seed.
Proliferation assay. PrEC, RWPE-1, and its N-methyl-N-nitrosourea–
derived prostate cancer cell lines were plated in quadruplicates at a density
of 1  104 (100 AL/well) into 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h in two
independent experiments. Cells were starved for 24 h (without EGF and
BPE), after which resveratrol (0, 5, 10, and 25 Amol/L) or MSKE (0, 2, 5, 10,
20 Ag/mL) was given daily. Cells were then harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h.
Stock solutions of resveratrol were prepared in DMSO, and MSKE was
prepared in 50% ETOH. Equal volumes of DMSO and ETOH ( final
concentrations, <0.01%) were added to the control cells. Cell viability was
measured using MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt] cell proliferation assay
kit (Promega). Sample absorption (indicative of formazan formation) was
determined using an ELISA plate reader (OPTImax microplate reader, MTX
Labsystems) at 490 nm. Results are expressed as mean absorbance F SE.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. PrEC, RWPE-1, and its
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea–derived prostate cancer cell lines were plated in
duplicates at a density of 1  105 cells per well in 6 well plates, which were
incubated for 24 h and subsequently synchronized by culturing without
EGF and BPE for 24 h in two independent experiments. Based on the results
from the cell growth assays, the cells were then treated with resveratrol or
MSKE at 25 Amol/L and 20 Ag/mL, respectively, for 24 h. The cells were then
washed with PBS (Invitrogen), harvested, fixed with 80% ETOH, stained
with propidium iodide, analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur), and
evaluated using Cell Quest and ModFit cell cycle analysis software (BD
Biosciences).
Apoptosis assays. Cells were plated in duplicate at a density of 1  105
cells per well in six-well plates in complete keratinocyte serum–free
medium for 24 h and/or 48 h. Subsequently, EGF and BPE were removed
from the media for 24 h, after which time media containing EGF and BPE
was provided to the cells with or without resveratrol or MSKE. The cells
were harvested, washed with PBS, stained using the Annexin V–FITC
antibody detection kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD
Biosciences), and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
The data was evaluated using Cell Quest analysis software. Results are
expressed as mean percentage F SE for two separate experiments. For
in situ apoptosis analysis, TUNEL staining was done (Roche Applied
Sciences). RWPE-1 and the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea–derived prostate
cancer cell lines were plated at a density of 4  104 cells per well in an
eight-chamber slide platform (Nunc-labtek, Nunc) in complete kertinocyte
serum–free medium for 24 h and subsequently growth factor–starved for
24 h. Cells were then treated with or without 20 Ag/mL MSKE for 24 h.

The cells were then washed twice with PBS and allowed to briefly dry.
The TUNEL reaction fluorescence mixture was added according to the
manufacturer’s directions (Roche Applied Sciences) to each well and placed
in a humidified incubator for 1 h at 37jC. Subsequently, cells were washed
thrice with PBS and then analyzed under a fluorescence microscope.
Signal transduction phosphorylation analyses. The human phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) array kit was used
according to manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems). WPE1-NB26 metastatic prostate cells were plated at a density of 6  105 cells in a 10-cm dish
in complete keratinocyte serum–free medium for 24 h, starved without
growth factors for 24 h, and then treated with or without 20 Ag/mL MSKE
for 4 or 8 h. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The lysate (250 Ag) was added to the nitrocellulose
membrane array, which was incubated overnight at 2jC to 8jC on a rocker
platform, washed, and incubated with the detection antibody cocktail. After
washing, secondary antibody (streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase, 1:2,000)
was added. Protein signals were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Western analysis was done on total cell lysates. Duplicate
gene signals on the array were quantitated using AlphaEase Fluorochem
imaging software (IMGEN Technologies). Results are expressed as average
pixel density F SE.
Protein isolation and Western blotting. Cells were cultured as
described above for 0, 30 min, 8 h, and/or 24 h, washed with cold PBS,
and then lysed with cell lysis buffer (17) containing 25 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100
supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences), 50 mmol/L
sodium fluoride, and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovandate. Proteins (20 Ag) were
separated using 10% or 16% precast Tris-glycine gels and transferred
overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). The membrane was
blocked for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST [15 mmol/L
NaCl/100 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5)/0.1% Tween] and probed with anti–DJ-1
(1:1,000 diluted in 1% BSA in TBST), PI3K-p85, phosphorylated PDK1, AKT,
phosphorylated Akt, ERK, phosphorylated ERK, p38, phosphorylated p38,
phosphorylated GSK-3h, cyclinD1 (1:500 diluted in 1% BSA in TBST), or
androgen receptor (1:200 diluted in 1% BSA in TBST) overnight at 4jC. After
washing with TBST, the blots were treated with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated antibody for 20 min and washed several times. Proteins were
detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Western analysis was
done on total cell lysate.
For the proteosome degradation Western assay, the above protocol was
followed except that the WPE1-NB26 prostate cells were treated with or
without 20 Ag/mL MSKE, 20 Amol/L MG132, proteosomal degradation
inhibitor plus 20 Ag/mL MSKE for 0, 4, and/or 8 h. The blot was probed with
anti–PI3K-p85 and Akt.
To evaluate the effects of resveratrol on protein expression of cell cycle
regulators, the above protocol was followed, except that all four cell lines
were treated with 25 Amol/L resveratrol for 24 h. The blot was probed with
anti-cdk4, cyclin D1, cdk2, cyclin E, p21, and p27.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen).
cDNA (3 Ag) was prepared using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis
System for reverse transcription-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR reactions were done using the SYBR
green QPCR master mix (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Before the PCR reaction, a dilution series and standard curve
were generated for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH)
and each target gene from the untreated and treated prostate cancer
sample cDNAs (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was done with a
polymerase-activating step of 95jC for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of a
cycling program of 95jC for 15 s and 60jC for 1 min with a dissociation
curve program of 95jC for 15 s, 60jC for 1 min, and 95jC for 15 s in an ABI
Prism 7500 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Forward and reverse
primers were respectively as follows: human Akt1, 5¶-ATGAGCGACGTGGCTATTGTGAAG-3¶ and 5¶-GAGGCCGTCAGCCACAGTCTGGATG-3¶; human
Akt2, 5¶-ATGAATGAGGTGTCTGTCATCAAAGAAGGC-3¶ and 5¶-TGCTTGAGGCTGTTGGCGACC-3¶; human Akt3, 5¶-ATGAGCGATGTTACCATTGT-3¶ and
5¶-CAGTCTGTCTGCTACAGCCTGGATA-3¶ (18); human DJ-1, 5¶-GGAGACGGTCATCCCTGTAGAT-3¶ and 5¶-GCTACACTGTACTGGGTCTTTTCCA-3¶

(19); human GADPH, 5¶-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3¶ and 5¶-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3¶. The relative expression levels of each gene were
calculated by dividing the expression level of Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, and DJ-1 by the
expression level of GADPH for each sample and compared with the untreated
corresponding control. Quantitative analysis of gene expression was done using
the 2-DDCT method.
Statistical analysis. All statistical procedures were carried out using SAS
Institute Inc. version 8 statistical software package (SAS Institute). Statistical
analysis evaluating cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis used
ANOVA followed by Student-Neuman-Keuls post hoc test. To evaluate
protein expression levels in the array, we used Student’s t test with post hoc
Bonferroni adjustments.

Results
MSKE does not contain significant quantities of resveratrol
and differs from MSEE. To determine whether MSKE contains
significant levels of resveratrol and to compare the chemical content of MSKE (skin) with MSEE (seed), HPLC analyses were done.
As depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1A and B, MSKE does not
contain significant amounts of resveratrol (<1 Ag/g by limit of
detection). However, when resveratrol was added to MSKE as a
control, it was readily detected, and 86% of the resveratrol was
recovered (data not shown). As seen in Supplementary Fig. S1B and
C, MSKE and MSEE exhibit very different chromatogram patterns
indicating that the chemical components in each extract are quite
varied with relatively little overlap.
Resveratrol and MSKE alter cellular morphology, inhibit
growth, but do not induce senescence of prostate cancer cells.
The morphologic changes observed in the normal and transformed
human prostate cell lines in response to resveratrol or MSKE are
depicted in Supplementary Fig. S2. MSKE-treated cells display condensed nuclei, cell detachment, and irregular shape compared with
the control cells after 24 h, consistent with changes occurring during
apoptosis. These morphologic changes were seen only in the transformed human prostate cell lines and not in the normal primary
PrEC cells. Reservatrol did not induce these changes. However,
resveratrol induced morphologic changes after 72 h (data not
shown). In addition, neither MSKE nor resveratrol induced senescence in the transformed cells as assessed using the senescenceassociated h-galactosidase activity (data not shown).
The effects of different concentrations of resveratrol and MSKE
on growth of the prostate cell lines are depicted in Figs. 1B-D and
2B-D. Resveratrol (25 Amol/L) significantly inhibits cell growth by
72 h in all four transformed human prostate cell lines. Similarly, 5,
10, and 20 Ag/mL MSKE significantly inhibited cell growth by at
least 50% in the WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, and WPE1-NB26 cell
lines by 24 h, with growth inhibition sustained over 72 h. These
findings were confirmed using a titrated thymidine proliferation
assay (data not shown). Moreover, we observed a similar significant
growth inhibition by MSKE in other well-established prostate
cancer cell lines, LNCaP and DU-145 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
However, in contrast to the reduction in proliferation observed for
the prostate cancer cell lines, resveratrol and MSKE did not
significantly inhibit cell growth of normal primary prostate cells
(Figs. 1A and 2A). The inhibitory effects were shown to be due to
the compound and not the solvents, because solvent alone did not
produce growth inhibition and similar inhibitory effects were
observed when either ethanol or DMSO were used as solvents.
Resveratrol induces cell cycle arrest in prostate cells
through increased expression of p21 and decreased expression
of cyclins and cdks. To determine whether the reduction in cell

proliferation was due to cell cycle arrest, cell death, or a
combination of both, propidium iodide FACS analyses were done.
These results reveal that resveratrol blocks the G1-S phase
transition in all four prostate cancer cell lines, whereas MSKE
seems to preferentially induce apoptosis. As depicted in Fig. 3B,
f25% more cells from all four transformed cell lines remained in
the G1-S phase of the cell cycle when treated with 25 Amol/L
resveratrol compared with the control cells, whereas resveratrol did
not significantly inhibit cell cycle progression in normal primary
PrEC cells. In contrast, MSKE significantly arrested at least 50% of
the transformed prostate cells at the G0-G1-S transition and MSKE
(Fig. 3A) resulted in a 15% increase in cells inhibited at the S-G2M
transition phase compared with the control cells (Fig. 3B).
However, MSKE does not significantly inhibit cell cycle progression
of the primary normal cells.
Based upon the demonstration that resveratrol treatment
primarily induced cell cycle arrest at the G1-S phase transition,
the effects of resveratrol on cell cycle regulators of the G1 phase of
the cell cycle were investigated. Immunoblot analysis revealed that
treatment with 25 Amol/L resveratrol resulted in a marked
reduction of cdk4 and cyclin D1 in all four cell lines (Fig. 6D).
Decreases in cyclin E protein expression were observed only in
RWPE-1, WPE1-NB14, WPE1-NB26 prostate cells. Resveratrol did

www.aacrjournals.org

not modulate cdk2 protein expression in this system. A marked
induction of the major cell cycle inhibitory proteins was also
observed in response to resveratrol. p21 was significantly elevated
in all four prostate cell lines and p27 was elevated in WPE1-NA22
and WPE1-NB26 at 24 h (Fig. 6D).
MSKE, but not resveratrol, induces apoptosis in prostate
cancer cells through inhibition of the Akt survival pathway.
Based upon both the morphologic and FACS analyses suggesting
that MSKE induced apoptosis, additional apoptosis assays were
done. The results from the Annexin V–FITC (Fig. 4A and B) and
TUNEL-FITC assays (data not shown) confirm that MSKE, but not
resveratrol, induces apoptosis in the transformed prostate cancer
cell lines. In addition, a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis was
observed in the WPE1-NB26 metastatic cells (Fig. 4C), whereas the
MSKE did not significantly induce apoptosis in normal primary
prostate cells (Fig. 4D).
Several studies have shown the critical roles that the signaling
pathways related to Akt kinase and MAPK play in regulating cell
growth, survival, and inhibition of apoptosis in prostate cancer
(20–22). Using a human phosphorylated MAPK protein array that
includes major families of MAPK as well as intracellular kinases,
such as Akt, GSK-3h, and p70 S6 that are important in signal
transduction and cellular proliferation, multiple changes in

phosphorylation states were observed in response to MSKE. MSKE
significantly increases phosphorylation by at least 2-fold of targeted
c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK1, JNK2), p38 isoforms (p38g, p38a), and
intracellular kinases (GSK-3h, MSK2, p70 S6) in WPE1-NB26
metastatic prostate cells after 4 h (Fig. 5A and C). Similar results
were also observed at 8 h with increases in JNK2, p38 isoforms
(p38g, p38a), and intracellular kinases (MSK2). Additionally, as
depicted in Fig. 5B and C, decreases in several intracellular kinases
(ERK1, RSK1, Akt1, ERK2, GSK-3h, Akt3) were observed.
Western blot analyses were done to confirm these results. As
shown in Fig. 6A, 20 Ag/mL MSKE treatment of WPE1-NA22 and
WPE1-NB26 prostate cell lines resulted in a marked reduction of
PI3K p85, phosphorylated PDK1, all three isoforms of Akt,
phosphorylated Akt (Thr308), phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated
p38, phosphorylated GSK-3h (Ser9), cyclin D1, and androgen
receptor. In addition, MSKE decreased phosphorylation of Forkhead (FKHR) protein, a downstream effector molecule of the Akt
pathway that is involved in caspase activation and induction of
apoptosis when dephosphorylated. The decreased expression of
PI3K p85, phosphorylated PDK1, Akt, phosphorylated Akt, GSK-3h,

FKHR, cyclin D1, and androgen receptor was observed for 24 h in
all transformed prostate cell lines treated with MSKE (Fig. 6B).
Interestingly, MSKE did not affect total protein levels of p38 and
ERK1/ERK2 in WPE1-NA22 and WPE1-NB26 prostate cancer cells.
Although, the Akt protein levels were decreased, levels of DJ-1, a
novel protein regulator of PTEN, were not altered after 30 min or
8 h (Fig. 6A). However, a marked reduction in DJ-1 was observed in
the WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, and WPE1-NB26 prostate cancer cell
lines at 24 h (Fig. 6B). In contrast, Akt protein levels were not
altered in cells treated with 25 Amol/L resveratrol (data not
shown).
MSKE accelerates degradation of Akt protein. Based upon
the above results demonstrating that MSKE significantly suppresses Akt protein expression, we determined whether MSKE
alters rates of Akt protein degradation. MSKE was shown to induce
Akt protein degradation by 8 h, but not at 4 h (Fig. 6C). However,
upon coadministration of MGE132, a 26S proteosomal degradation
inhibitor, Akt protein levels were maintained in the presence of
MSKE, thus suggesting that MSKE accelerates the degradation of
Akt protein (Fig. 6C).

MSKE decreases Akt and DJ-1 mRNA expression levels.
Treatment with MSKE reduced mRNA levels of all Akt isoforms and
DJ-1, consistent with the results observed from the protein array
and Western blot analyses. Akt3 mRNA levels was reduced by at
least 50% in WPE1-NA22 and WPE1-NB26 cells treated with MSKE
for 8 h compared with untreated control cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Similarly, a 2-fold reduction in DJ-1 mRNA levels was
observed in WPE1-NB14 treated with MSKE compared with control
cells. At least 2-fold reductions of mRNA levels were also observed
for Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, and DJ-1 mRNA levels in WPE1-NA22, WPE1NB14, and WPE1-NB26 cells treated with MSKE at 24 h compared
with untreated control cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). However, a
reduction in Akt2 mRNA levels was not observed in WPE1-NB14
cells. Additional results indicate that Akt1 and Akt2 mRNA levels
are significantly lower in the premalignant WPE1-NA22 cells
compared with the metastatic WPE1-NB26 prostate cells by 8 h
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). However, the difference was not
maintained over time.

Discussion
The identification of new compounds with antitumor activities
but minimal systemic toxicity is critical for discovering substances

www.aacrjournals.org

that may have significant effects in cancer prevention and possibly
treatment. Some members of the flavonoid class of phytochemicals
have been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis by numerous mechanisms, including antiinflammatory activities, induction of cell cycle
arrest, inhibition of catalytic topoisomerase, suppression of cellular
proliferation, stimulation of apoptosis and antioxidant properties
(1). Because the effects of MSKE on prostate cancer have not been
previously studied, we explored whether MSKE contains potentially
novel compounds that can inhibit the growth of prostate cancer
cells at different stages of tumor cell progression and through what
mechanisms of action such antitumor activities are induced.
HPLC analyses showed that MSKE does not contain resveratrol,
a compound commonly found in red grapes and red wines that
exhibit many biological effects, including tumor inhibition.
Additionally, chromatograms of MSKE show significant differences
compared with chromatograms from muscadine seed extract,
indicating that the skin and seed of the muscadine grape have very
different chemical compositions with potentially unique biological
properties. Preliminary purification analyses show that activity of
MSKE can be segregated into subfractions which do not contain
compounds with known antitumor activity including gallic acid,
quercetin, and ellagic acid.

Figure 4. MSKE induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. A, MSKE induces apoptosis in RWPE-1, WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, and WPE1-NB26 prostate cells.

Because resveratrol has been previously studied in prostate
cancer models (7, 23), we compared the effects of MSKE with that
of resveratrol on a series of transformed human prostate cells,
which include the RWPE-1 line (nontumorigenic), the WPE1-NB26
line (highly metastatic), and two cell lines with intermediate
properties. Importantly, MSKE was found to exhibit different
effects and mechanisms of action on the human cancer cells lines
compared with resveratrol. Both MSKE and resveratrol did not
alter the growth characteristics of normal human primary prostate
epithelial cells, suggesting that these compounds may not induce
toxic effects in vivo. Interestingly, the fact that all of the cell lines
studied representing different stages of prostate cancer tumor progression responded to MSKE suggests that the active compound(s)
in this extract may inhibit tumorigenesis at very early stages.
Distinct morphologic changes were observed in the MSKE and
resveratrol treated tumor cells, but not normal primary cells.
Changes in nuclear morphology and increased cell death suggested
that MSKE was inducing apoptosis, whereas cells treated with
resveratrol did not exhibit features of apoptosis and death. FACS
analysis showed that treatment with resveratrol caused a G1-S cell

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

cycle arrest, whereas treatment with MSKE induced a large fraction
of cells in the sub-G0 fraction consistent with apoptosis. Induction
of apoptosis by MSKE was further confirmed by TUNEL assay. We
further showed that MSKE exerted similar antitumor cell inhibitory
action against the commonly studied LnCaP and DU-145 prostate
cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis. These data suggest that
MSKE is targeting pathways involved in apoptosis and that
resveratrol is targeting pathways involved in cell cycle arrest in
this system. Therefore, MSKE and resveratrol seem to inhibit tumor
growth in this model system through different mechanisms.
The PI3K, Akt, and MAPK have been shown to be critical
regulators of prostate tumor growth through enhancing survival
signaling and reducing apoptosis (24–26). The results of this study
clearly show that MSKE increases JNK2, p38 isoforms (p38g, p38a),
and intracellular kinases (MSK2) and decreases intracellular
kinases (ERK1, RSK1, Akt1, ERK2, GSK-3h, Akt3). The data suggest
that MSKE is able to indirectly or directly target multiple pathways
that are involved in cell survival and apoptosis. Previous studies
have shown that the phytochemicals genstein and quercetin
activate JNK and attenuate EGF, Akt1, and MAP/ERK kinase 1/2

Inhibition of Prostate Cancer Growth

in DU-145 and PC-3 metastatic prostate cancer cells (27, 28). In
addition, Tyagi et al. showed that the induction of apoptosis in
DU-145 prostate metastatic cells in response to grape seed extract
is through the inhibition of EGF and activation of JNK (26). In this
study, we show that the induction of apoptosis by MSKE may be
induced in transformed, but nontumorigenic, prostate cells as well
as in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells through the attenuation of
the Akt pathway. The modulation of these important signaling
proteins by MSKE was confirmed by Western blot analysis showing
an increase in p38 and decreases in PI3K p85, phosphorylated
PDK1, all three isoforms of Akt, phosphorylated Akt (Thr308),
phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated p38, phosphorylated GSK-3h
(Ser9), cyclinD1, and androgen receptor at 30 min or 8 h.
DJ-1 is thought to be a critical regulator of the Akt pathway by
negatively regulating PTEN (19, 29). For instance, it has been shown
that reduced DJ-1 expression resulted in decreased phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt, whereas overexpression led to increased phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt and increased cell survival (29). Elevated
levels of DJ-1 have been associated with human breast cancer (30).
Although, DJ-1 was not modulated by MSKE at 8 h, DJ-1 protein

expression decreased at 24 h, suggesting that MSKE may indirectly
target DJ-1. This is the first report suggesting that a phytochemical is
capable of modulating DJ-1. Consistent with reduced protein
expression of Akt and DJ-1 by MSKE, we observed a decrease in
mRNA levels of all three Akt isoforms and DJ-1 in WPE1-NA22,
WPE1-NB14, and WPE1-NB26 prostate cancer cells.
Therefore, based on these results, we propose that MSKE may
target different signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death. MSKE targets the PI3K/Akt pathway
by suppressing phosphorylation of the upstream effector molecule
PI3K, thereby reducing activation of the survival kinase, Akt
(protein kinase B). The decrease in total Akt and Akt phosphorylation results in decreased phosphorylation of GSK-3 and FKHR,
and total cyclin D1 downstream effector molecules of the Akt
survival pathway, leading to a decrease in cell survival and
increased apoptosis.
MSKE action may also involve the p38 pathway, because MSKE
induced phosphorylation (but not increased total levels) of p38
protein. In addition, we observed significant suppression of ERK1/
ERK2 phosphorylation associated with decreased cell survival,

Figure 5. MSKE targets MAPK phosphorylated proteins that are
involved in apoptosis. The human phosphorylated MAPK array
shows that 20 Ag/mL MSKE targets JNK, p38, MSK2, and GSK-3
phosphorylated proteins for 4 h (A) and JNK, p38, ERK, MSK2,
Akt, and GSK-3 for 8 h (B ) in the WPE1-NB26 metastatic prostate
cell line. C, the fold-change of each gene at 4 and 8 h. Proteins
on the array were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence
system. Relative fold change represents the comparison of treated
versus untreated of the average pixel density signals on
corresponding arrays. Western analysis was done on total cell
lysate. The array signals from the X-ray film images were analyzed
using image software analysis. Each phosphorylated MAPK array

positive and six negative controls. Columns, average pixel density;

Figure 6. MSKE induces apoptosis through the PI3K/Akt cell survival pathway. A, WPE1-NA22 and WPE1-NB26 MSKE-treated cells were plated at a density of 6  105
per well for 24 h, starved for 24 h, and treated with or without 20 Ag/mL MSKE for 0, 30, and 8 min. Western blot and immunodetection using anti-DJ-1, PI3k-p85,
phosphorylated PDK1, AKT, phosphorylated Akt, ERK, phosphorylated ERK, p38, phosphorylated p38, phosphorylated GSK-3h, cyclin D1, and androgen receptor
antibodies were done. B, Western blot and immunodetection using anti–DJ-1, PI3K-p85, phosphorylated PDK1, AKT, phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated GSK-3h,
cyclin D1, and androgen receptor antibodies were done in MSKE treated in RWPE-1, WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, and WPE1-NB26 prostate cells for 24 h. C, 20 Ag/mL
MSKE induces degradation of Akt in prostate cancer cells. The WPE1-NB26 prostate cells were treated with 20 Ag/mL MSKE or both MG132 and MSKE and the results
reveal that MSKE causes degradation of Akt. D, 25 Amol/L Resveratrol induces cell cycle arrest through cell cycle regulators. The results reveal decreases in
Cdk4, cyclin D1, Cdk2, and cyclin E and increases in p21, p27 protein expression in RWPE-1 nontumorigenic, WPE1-NA22 premalignant, WPE1-NB14 malignant,
WPE1-NB26 metastatic prostate cells. All proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system. All Western analyses were done on total cell lysate.

without changes in the total protein level of ERK1/ERK2. These
results show that MSKE exerts potentially important antitumor
activities through the effects on p38, ERK1/ERK2 and the PI3K/Akt
pathways, potentially resulting in increase apoptosis. Future studies
will elucidate more detailed mechanisms of action by MSKE on
these signaling pathways.
An additional mechanism of action of MSKE on inhibition of the
Akt survival pathway seems to involve increased proteosomemediated degradation of Akt. The ubiquitin-proteosome degradation system plays a critical role in the degradation of cellular
proteins that regulate cellular functions (31). When the metastatic
WPE1-NB26 prostate cells were treated with MSKE, total Akt levels
decreased compared with untreated cells. However, when these
cells were treated with both MSKE and the proteosome inhibitor
MG132, Akt protein levels did not decrease, suggesting that MSKE
may target Akt for proteosome-mediated degradation of Akt.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

Interestingly, resveratrol in this model system seemed to inhibit
tumor cell growth through a different mechanism relative to MSKE,
involving G1-S phase cell cycle arrest. This was associated with a
marked decrease in Cdk4 and cyclin D1 and a significant increase
in the cell cycle inhibitor p21. In addition, we observed a decrease
of cyclin E in the nontumorigenic, malignant, and metastatic
prostate cell lines, in conjunction with an increase of p27 in
nontumorigenic, and metastatic prostate cell lines. However,
protein expression of cdk2, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor of
cyclin E, was not modulated by resveratrol in this model system.
Thus, the data suggest that the primary targets of resveratrol in this
model system possibly includes cdk4–cyclin D1 complex and p21.
Our data are in agreement with other reported studies, which
conclude that cdk4 and cyclin D1, p21, and p27 operate together as
primary targets of resveratrol (32–35). Most importantly, these
reports indicate that similar concentrations of resveratrol used in

the current study were responsible for the G1-S phase arrest
observed in the above studies.
Although previous reports also showed that concentrations of
resveratrol (100–1,000 Amol/L) induced apoptosis, we did not
observe a significant induction of apoptosis or senescence by
resveratrol in the prostate cell model system used in this study
when given at 100 Amol/L (data not shown). This suggests that
resveratrol may preferentially activate different antitumor mechanisms, depending on the concentration used and the cell lines
studied. However, the results presented in this study are the first to
show that the cell cycle arrest induced by resveratrol can be
induced in nontumorigenic prostate cell lines.
Although MSKE has significant inhibitory effects on the prostate
cancer cell lines, it did not alter the growth variables of normal
human primary prostate cells. This strongly suggests that the
effects of MSKE may be specific for transformed cells, even at early
stages, and that MSKE may be potentially very useful as a

grape juice (given 4 mL/kg twice daily for 14 days) and grape
wine (given isocalorically at 240 mL/day) have been used in human

MSKE may be relatively safe in clinical trials. Therefore, MSKE may
be useful as a chemopreventive or therapeutic agent. Ongoing
in vivo studies of MSKE will further address the potential effects of
MSKE in preventing or inhibiting prostate cancer growth.
