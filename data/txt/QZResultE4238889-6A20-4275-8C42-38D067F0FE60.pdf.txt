ABSTRACT
Recent reports suggest that colorectal carcinoma (CRC) may be sustained by
a small subpopulation of cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have drug
resistance properties as a key reason for chemotherapy failure. The epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) controls CRC initiation and progression. Monoclonal antibody
against EGFR (cetuximab) has been used in treatment of several cancers. However,
the effects of cetuximab on CSCs in the CRC chemotherapy remain unclear. Here, we
studied the effects of cetuximab on the CSC-like cells in Fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated
CRC cells. CSC-like cells were independently isolated from CRC cells using CD133,
CD44 or EphB2-high as markers and confirmed by tumor sphere formation assay. We
found that 5-FU increased the apoptotic death of CSC-like CRC cells. Co-application of
cetuximab augmented the apoptotic death of CSC-like CRC cells by 5-FU, seemingly
through inhibition of 5-FU-induced increases in cell autophagy in CSC-like CRC cells.
Together, our data suggest that EGFR monoclonal antibody may sensitize CSC-like
CRC cells to 5-FU-induced apoptosis by affecting autophagy.

INTRODUCTION

However, the current identification of CRCs in CRC is
not satisfactory [18–24].
Autophagy is a catabolic pathway for degradation
and recycling of the cellular compartments for cell survival
at harsh environments, using regularly by cancer cells to
improve survival against chemotherapy [25–27]. During
autophagy, a cytosolic form of microtubule-associated
protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-I) conjugates to form
LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II), as a
feature of autophagic activities [25–27]. Among all proteins
that regulate autophagy, autophagy-associated protein 6
(ATG6, or Beclin-1) plays a pivotal role [28].
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
signaling pathway is involved in the initiation and
progression of CRC [29–32]. Cetuximab is a FDAapproved EGFR chemeric human-murine monoclonal
antibody against EGFR (cetuximab). However, the effects
of cetuximab on CSCs in the chemotherapy of CRC
remain unclear.
Here, we studied the effects of cetuximab on the
CSC-like cells in Fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated CRC cells.
CSC-like cells were independently isolated from CRC

Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third common
cancer in humans [1–3]. Although the primary CRC are
highly curable, some CRC may migrate to distal tissues,
resulting in poor prognosis [4]. Recent reports suggest that
CRC may be sustained by specific cells called cancer stem
cells (CSCs). CRCs have potential innate drug resistance
properties, leading to chemotherapy failure [4]. Moreover,
CSCs are supposed to be responsible for the majority of
the cancer invasiveness and metastases, which highlights
the significance of treating CSCs rather than the complete
cancer mass during cancer therapy [4].
CSCs are highly tumorigenic, and often play critical
roles in cancer relapse and metastases [5–8]. Hence,
treatments targeting CSCs may substantially improve the
therapy [5–8]. Cell surface markers are pretty critical for
isolating CSCs using a cell biology technology called flow
cytometry. Importantly, although many cancers share same
CSC markers, some CSC markers appear to be cancerspecific. In CRC, the best established ones are prominin-1
(CD133) [9–11], CD44 [12–14], and EphB2 [15–17].

cells using CD133, CD44 or EphB2-high as markers and
the features of these cells as CSC-like cells were proven
by tumor sphere formation assay. We found that 5-FU
increased the apoptotic death of CSC-like CRC cells, in
an CCK-8 assay and an apoptotic assay. Co-application
of cetuximab augmented the apoptotic death of CSC-like
CRC cells by 5-FU, seemingly through inhibition of 5-FUinduced increases in cell autophagy in CSC-like CRC
cells. Together, our data suggest that EGFR monoclonal
antibody may sensitize CSC-like CRC cells to 5-FUinduced apoptosis by affecting autophagy.

cells (Figure 3B). To confirm that EphB2-high cells may be
enriched for CSCs, we performed tumor sphere formation
assay. We found that EphB2-high cells formed significantly
more spheres than EphB2-low cells, in either HT-29 cells
(Figure 3C), or SW480 cells (Figure 3D). Quantification
was shown in Figure 3E. Hence, EphB2-high cells are
enriched with CSCs in CRC. Thus, these enriched CSCpopulations (CD133+; CD44+; EphB2-high) were
independently used for analyzing the effects of cetuximab
on the CSC population of CRC cells treated with 5-FU.

EGFR inhibition increases 5-FU-induced
apoptotic death in CSC-like CRC cells

RESULTS

Cultured CD133+ HT-29 cells, or SW480 cells were
treated with/without 5-FU. Moreover, the 5-FU-treated
cells were also treated with cetuximab, or control IgG.
After 24 hours, the cells were analyzed. We found that
5-FU significantly reduced the cell viability of CD133+
CRC cells, in an CCK-8 assay (Figure 4A), seemingly
by increasing the apoptotic cell death (Figure 4B–4C).
Co-application of cetuximab augmented the apoptotic
death of CD133+ CRC cells by 5-FU (Figure 1A–1C). We
got similar results, using CD44+ or EphB2 cells in this
study (not shown). Thus, EGFR inhibition increases 5-FUinduced apoptotic death in CSC-like CRC cells.

CD133-positive cells are enriched with CSCs in
CRC
In order to examine the effects of cetuximab
on the CSC population of CRC cells treated with
chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. 5-FU), we isolated CSC-like
cells from CRC cell lines using different CSC markers,
CD133, CD44 and EphB2, independently. We chose
two CRC cell lines, HT-29 and SW480, in our study.
HT-29 cells express low levels of EGFR, and has wildtype KRAS. On the other hand, SW480 express high
levels of EGFR, and has mutated KRAS [37]. Hence,
these two lines are very good representatives in analyzing
the effects of cetuximab on the CSC population of CRC
cells treated with 5-FU.
First, we isolated CD133+ cells vs CD133− cells
from either HT-29 cells (Figure 1A), or SW480 cells
(Figure 1B). To confirm that CD133+ cells may be
enriched for CSCs, we performed tumor sphere formation
assay. We found that CD133+ cells formed significantly
more spheres than CD133− cells, in either HT-29 cells
(Figure 1C), or SW480 cells (Figure 1D). Quantification
was shown in Figure 1E. Hence, CD133-positive cells are
enriched with CSCs in CRC.

EGFR inhibition reduces 5-FU-induced cell
autophagy in CSC-like CRC cells
Since autophagy and apoptosis are closely related
and may affect each other at molecular level, we thus
examined whether EGFR inhibition may alter cell
autophagy in 5-FU-treated CSC-like CRC cells. LCII vs
LC I levels are a golden standard for evaluating cellular
autophagy activity. We found that 5-FU induced cell
autophagy in CD133+ CRC cells, which was significantly
attenuated by cetuximab (Figure 5A–5B). Similar results
were obtained when we used either CD44+ cells, or
EphB2-high cells (Figure 5C–5F). Thus, 5-FU may not
only induce apoptotic cell death of CSC-likes in CRC,
but also induce cell autophagy to contradict apoptotic
cell death to allow some cells to survive the treatment.
However, cetuximab may inhibit the autophagy to increase
the sensitivity of CSC-like CRC cells to chemotherapy
(Figure 6).

CD44-positive cells are enriched with CSCs in
CRC
Then, we isolated CD44+ cells vs CD44− cells
from either HT-29 cells (Figure 2A), or SW480 cells
(Figure 2B). To confirm that CD44+ cells may be
enriched for CSCs, we performed tumor sphere formation
assay. We found that CD44+ cells formed significantly
more spheres than CD44− cells, in either HT-29 cells
(Figure 2C), or SW480 cells (Figure 2D). Quantification
was shown in Figure 2E. Hence, CD44-positive cells are
enriched with CSCs in CRC.

DISCUSSION
CSCs are characterized by their drug resistance
properties. Treatments targeting CSCs thus could improve
the therapeutic outcome of rapidly growing cancers and
highly metastatic cancers [5–8].
In the current study, we showed that 5-FU treated
CRC cells underwent apoptotic cell death. However, the
effects of 5-FU on CRC cells could be augmented by co-

been widely used in treating malignant cancer in clinic.
Here, we examined two CRC cell lines, among which

SW480 has mutated KRAS while HT29 has wild-type
KRAS. Those cell lines thus represent CRC cells with or
without mutated KRAS. Since mutated KRAS is resistant

to EGFR-targeted mAbs [38], our data that show coapplication of cetuximab with 5-FU is effective for both
lines may suggest that the effects of cetuximab on cell
death are indirectly and may result from the changes of
sensitivity of CRC cells to 5-FU. This conclusion is also
supported by the data that a control group of cetuximab
alone of same dosage did not have significant effects on
cell death.
Interestingly, we found that the effects of cetuximab
on CRC cells appeared to be on CSC-like cells, which
were independently isolated from CRC cells using
CD133, CD44 or EphB2-high as markers. Of note, these
markers have been used to enrich CSC cells, but not purify
them. Using these markers independently increased the
reliability of the conclusion on CSC cells, which were
further proved by tumor sphere formation assay, which is
a gold method for validating CSCs. We found that 5-FU
increased the apoptotic death of CSC-like CRC cells in
an apoptotic assay. Moreover, the changes in cell number
were confirmed in a CCK-8 assay.
Then, we studied the mechanisms underlying the
cetuximab augmented CRC cell death. We found that
5-FU treatment decreased CRC cell viability in a dosedependent manner. However, this 5-FU-induced CRC
cell death appeared to be attenuated by augmentation
in autophagy-associated cell survival. Thus, 5-FU
may induce both apoptotic cell death and autophagic
cell survival in CRC cells, while autophagy could be
a negative feedback from CRC cells to resist 5-FU. In
another word, 5-FU damaged CRC cells, the CSC-like
cells from which upregulated autophagy associated
proteins to enhance autophagic cell survival against
the effects of 5-FU. The cetuximab treatment inhibited
the autophagy of CSC-like cells from CRC, resulting
in improved elimination of the CRC. A limitation of
the current study is that the effect of cetuximab/5-FU
adjunctive treatment in vivo was not investigated, which
should be addressed in future studies. Moreover, further
dissection of the details of the involved signaling pathway
is highly needed.
Together, our data suggest that EGFR monoclonal
antibody may sensitize CSC-like CRC cells to 5-FUinduced apoptosis by affecting autophagy. Cetuximab
treatment may be a promising treatment targeting chemoresistance of CSC-likes from CRC.

Cell line culture and treatment

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability assay

Protocol approval

The CCK-8 detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich) was used
to measure cell viability according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 96-well
microplate at a density of 5 × 104/ml. After 24 h, cells were
treated with resveratrol. Subsequently, CCK-8 solution
(20 ml/well) was added and the plate was incubated at
37oC for 2 h. The viable cells were counted by absorbance

From all published CRC cell lines, we selected
HT-29 and SW480 in our study. HT-29 is a colorectal
adenocarcinoma from a 44 year-old female, and has
been describe before [33]. SW480 is a colorectal
adenocarcinoma from a 50 year-old male, and has been
describe before [34]. Both lines were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
MD, USA), and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS; SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in a humidified chamber
with 5% CO2 at 37°C. 5-FU (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared
in a stock of 1 mmol/l and applied to the cultured CRC
cells at 2 µmol/l [35, 36]. Cetuximab is an EGFR chemeric
human-murine monoclonal antibody, and was applied to
the cultured CRC cells at 0.5 mg/ml. Isotype-match IgG
of same concentration was used as a control.

Primary tumor sphere culture
Purified CSC-like cells by flow cytometry were
washed, acutely dissociated in oxygenated artificial
cerebrospinal fluid and subject to enzymatic dissociation.
Cells were then re-suspended in tumor sphere media
(TSM) consisting of a serum-free DMEM, human
recombinant EGF (20 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), bFGF
(20 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), leukemia inhibitory factor
(10 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and N-acetylcysteine
(60 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and then plated at a density of
2 × 106 cells/60 mm plate.

Analysis of CD133, CD44, and EphB2 by flow
cytometry
CD133, CD44, and EphB2 -based cell analysis and
sorting were performed by flow cytometry, using either
PEcy7-conjugated anti-human CD133 antibody, FITCconjugated anti-human CD44 antibody or APC-conjugated
anti-human EphB2 antibody (Becton-Dickinson
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), respectively. Flow
cytometry was performed using a FACSAria (BectonDickinson Biosciences) flow cytometer, and analyzed with
Flowjo software (Flowjo LLC, Ashland, OR, USA).
