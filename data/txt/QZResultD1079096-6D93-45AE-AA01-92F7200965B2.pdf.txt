Abstract
L-Type amino acid transporters such as LAT1 and LAT3 mediate the uptake of essential amino acids. Here, we
report that prostate cancer cells coordinate the expression of LAT1 and LAT3 to maintain sufﬁcient levels of
leucine needed for mTORC1 signaling and cell growth. Inhibiting LAT function was sufﬁcient to decrease cell
growth and mTORC1 signaling in prostate cancer cells. These cells maintained levels of amino acid inﬂux through
androgen receptor–mediated regulation of LAT3 expression and ATF4 regulation of LAT1 expression after amino
acid deprivation. These responses remained intact in primary prostate cancer, as indicated by high levels of LAT3
in primary disease, and by increased levels of LAT1 after hormone ablation and in metastatic lesions. Taken
together, our results show how prostate cancer cells respond to demands for increased essential amino acids by
coordinately activating amino acid transporter pathways vital for tumor outgrowth. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7525–36.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is initially regulated by androgens through
androgen receptor signaling (1). Androgen receptor is a liganddependent transcription factor that translocates into the
nucleus and binds to androgen response elements (ARE; ref. 2).
Androgen receptor mediates expression of many critical factors required for proliferation and viability of prostate cancer
growth, as well as kallikreins (KLK) such as prostate-speciﬁc
antigen (PSA; KLK3).
In addition to androgen receptor signaling, the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt pathway is critical in prostate cancer. Mutation
of PTEN, which commonly occurs in prostate cancer (3),
leads to phosphorylation and activation of Akt (4, 5) leading

to activation of mTORC1 signaling (6). The mTORC1 comprising mTOR, raptor, mLST8, and PRAS40 (7) requires
intracellular amino acids such as leucine for its activity
(8, 9). Recently, inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK)
has been shown to function as a physiologic mTOR cofactor
to stabilize the interaction of mTORC1 and raptor, facilitating activation of mTORC1 by Rag GTPases in the presence
of amino acids (10). Rag GTPases, together with the class III
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) Vps34, both mediate this
amino acid-mTORC1 signaling (11–13). Alternatively, amino
acid deprivation may activate GCN2-eIF2a-ATF4 which
triggers gene expression via amino acid response elements
(AARE; ref. 14).
Amino acid transporters regulate intracellular amino acid
levels; thus, changes in transporter expression or activity may
alter mTORC1 signaling. Prostate cancer–overexpressed gene
1 (POV1/LAT3/SLC43A1), ﬁrst described as a gene overexpressed in human prostate cancer (15, 16), is a member of the
L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) family (17). Members of
the LAT family mediate the Naþ-independent transport of
large neutral amino acids. LAT1 (SLC7A5) has been detected in
tumors of the lung (18) and its expression correlates with highgrade prostate cancer (19).
In this study, we show that signaling via the androgen
receptor and ATF4 pathways regulates expression of the amino
acid transporters LAT1 and LAT3, thereby coordinating their
increased expression in prostate cancer cells. This new connection linking these pathways provides the necessary essential amino acids to promote mTORC1 signaling and cell growth
in prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP-FGC, PC-3,
and DU145 were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. Human C4-2B prostate cancer cells were
obtained from ViroMed Laboratories Inc. Human MDAPCa-2b prostate cancer cells were a kind gift from A/Prof.
Qihan Dong at the University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW,
Australia. LNCaP cells have been passaged directly from
original low-passage stocks (2009), and we conﬁrmed PC-3
and DU145 cell identity by short tandem repeat proﬁling in
2010 (CellBank). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
(Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) FBS or charcoal-stripped
serum (CSS), penicillin–streptomycin solution (Sigma), and
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. MDAPCa-2b cells were cultured in Ham's F-12K medium with
dextran-coated charcoal-stripped serum, which has been
described previously (20). Chemicals were diluted as follows,
with control wells treated with the appropriate vehicle
controls: 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid
(BCH, Sigma; in PBS), bicalutamide (dimethyl sulfoxide,
AstraZeneca), dihydrotestosterone (DHT, Sigma; in ethanol),
and R1881 (ethanol; DuPont).
Leucine uptake assay
The [3H]-L-leucine uptake was conducted as detailed previously (21). Further details are available in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Cell viability assay
MTT (Millipore) assays were conducted as per the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (22). Further details are available in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Antibodies for Western blotting, immunoﬂuorescence,
and chromatin immunoprecipitation
Full details are available in Supplementary Materials and
Methods. Antibodies used were LAT3 [a kind gift from Dr.
Kunimasa Yan, Kyorin University, Tokyo, Japan (ref. 23)];
phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), mTOR, phospho-p70S6K (Thr389),
p70S6K, p15, p21, p27, cyclin D1, and cyclin D3 (all from Cell
Signaling Technology); LAT1 (Cosmo Bio); ATF4, androgen
receptor, a-tubulin, control rabbit IgG (all from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; Abcam); and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
donkey anti-mouse IgG, donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and goat
anti-mouse IgM secondary antibodies (Millipore).
Knockdown and overexpression constructs for LAT1 and
LAT3
Gene knockdown was achieved by stable transduction with
lentivirus, using the pLKO.1-puro vector system (Sigma) containing a LAT1- or LAT3-speciﬁc short hairpin RNA (shLAT1
and shLAT3; Supplementary Table S1). Control plasmid consisted of a plant microRNA sequence (miR159a; shControl;

Supplementary Table S1), which has no speciﬁc targets in
mammalian cells.
LAT1 and LAT3 cDNAs were inserted into an IRES-eGFP
cassette from pIRES2-eGFP (Clontech) and subcloned into a
tat-dependent lentiviral vector pHIV-1SDmCMVpre (22, 24).
Further details are available in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as mean  SEM. The Student t test
was used to compare differences among groups.

Results
Prostate cancer cell growth and mTORC1 signaling are
inhibited following blockade of LAT transport
To determine whether LATs are responsible for leucine
uptake in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, we treated cells with the
leucine analogue BCH, which is a speciﬁc inhibitor of LATs
(25). Incubation of LNCaP and PC-3 cells in the presence of
BCH signiﬁcantly decreased the radiolabeled leucine uptake
(Fig. 1A). Leucine uptake was inhibited by 79% and 61% of
control in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, respectively, upon BCH
treatment, suggesting that the majority of leucine transport
in these cells is dependent on the LAT family.
As leucine is an essential amino acid known to be important for protein synthesis, we next examined cell growth
using the MTT assay. BCH-treated LNCaP and PC-3 cells
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in cell growth and viability
over 3 days, compared with controls (Fig. 1B and C). The
inhibition was consistent with the reduced level of leucine
uptake by BCH, whereas removal of leucine from the culture
media resulted in complete growth arrest (Fig. 1B and C). To
directly test the regulation of cell proliferation by the LAT
family, we used a clonogenicity assay to examine the effect of
BCH on cell growth. In the presence of BCH, there was a
signiﬁcant decrease in colony formation in LNCaP cells (74%
inhibition) and in PC-3 cells (21% inhibition; Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S1A). BCH treatment also inhibited leucine
uptake (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and decreased cell growth
(Supplementary Fig. S1C) in DU145 cells, which contain
wild-type PTEN.
In the control LNCaP cells, 75% of cells accumulated in the
G0–G1 phase, 13% in S-phase, and 11% in G2–M phase (Fig. 1E;
Supplementary Fig. S1D). However, in the presence of BCH,
signiﬁcantly more cells accumulated in the G0–G1 phase (88%),
with only 7% in S-phase and 4% in G2–M phase (Fig. 1E;
Supplementary Fig. S1D). However, in PC-3 cells, there was
no signiﬁcant change in the percentage of cells in each cellcycle stage (Fig. 1F; Supplementary Fig. S1E).
To further examine cell proliferation, we used a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay. When LNCaP cells were
treated with BCH, BrdUrd incorporation decreased signiﬁcantly from 37% to 16% compared with untreated control cells (Fig.
1G; Supplementary Fig. S1F). In PC-3 cells, BrdUrd incorporation decreased from 45% to 28% (Fig. 1G; Supplementary Fig.
S1F). These results suggest that the rate of prostate cancer cells
entering the cell cycle is decreased when LATs are blocked.

Wang et al.

To determine whether known cell-cycle regulators were
responsible for the changes observed in LNCaP cell cycle
following LAT blockade, we examined the expression of the
p21 and p27 family and the p15 family by Western blotting.
BCH treatment led to increased expression of the cell-cycle
inhibitor p27 (1.8-fold) after 24 hours, with no change in p21 or
p15 levels (Fig. 1H). We also observed a decrease in the
expression of cyclin D3 (0.6-fold), with no change in cyclin
D1 expression (Fig. 1I). These results suggest that blocking
LAT-mediated leucine transport affected cell-cycle progression through G1 phase checkpoints.
As mTORC1 signaling is regulated by leucine, we examined
the activation of mTOR and its downstream target p70S6K
by phosphorylation using Western blotting. In the presence
of BCH, phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) and p70S6K
(p-p70S6K) levels were decreased in LNCaP cells and to a
lesser extent in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1J and K).
To examine whether BCH inhibition of LATs induced apoptosis, we used Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and
measured caspase 3/7 activation. Blocking leucine transport
did not substantially increase the amount of apoptosis in
LNCaP or PC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C).
LAT3 regulates LNCaP and PC-3 cell growth
Because BCH inhibits all members of the LAT family, we next
set out to determine which speciﬁc transporters were mediating cell growth in prostate cancer. Both LAT3 (16) and LAT1
(19) are expressed in prostate cancer tissues. Analysis of
microarray data (GDS1699; ref. 26) showed that LAT1 and
LAT3 exhibit higher expression than other LAT family members in a variety of prostate cancer cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S3A–S3D). To conﬁrm these data, we used Western
blotting of LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines to show LAT3 protein
expression (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we conﬁrmed the correct
distribution of LAT3 protein on the plasma membrane in both
cell lines by immunoﬂuorescence (Fig. 2B).
To determine whether LAT3 mediates leucine uptake in
LNCaP and PC-3 cells, we used lentiviral vectors to stably
express shRNAs for a nontargeting control (plant miR159a;
shControl) or against LAT3 (shLAT3). Western blot analyses
showed that shLAT3 could effectively reduce LAT3 expression
by more than 50% in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Fig. 2C).
Knockdown of LAT3 expression signiﬁcantly reduced the
uptake of leucine in LNCaP (61%) and PC-3 cells (40%) compared with shControl cells (Fig. 2D) and decreased p-p70S6K
activation (Supplementary Fig. S4A). The expression of shLAT3
led to a signiﬁcant decrease in cell growth and clonogenicity in
LNCaP, and to a less extent PC-3 cells, similar to that observed
in BCH-treated control cells (Fig. 2E–G; Supplementary Fig.
S1A). These results suggest that LAT3 is the major LAT family
member regulating cell growth in the androgen-sensitive
LNCaP cell line.
To further examine the function of LAT3 in prostate cancer
cell lines, we ectopically expressed LAT3 in LNCaP and PC-3
cells. While Western blot analyses showed that LAT3 was
marginally overexpressed (Supplementary Fig. S4B), there was
a signiﬁcant increase in leucine transport in LNCaP cells
(4-fold; Fig. 2H). This did not affect cell growth (Supplementary

7528

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

Fig. S4C) but resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in clonogenicity
(4-fold of control; Fig. 2I). Cell-cycle analysis also showed that
LAT3 overexpression signiﬁcantly increased cell-cycle progression (Supplementary Fig. S4E). However, no change was
observed on PC-3 cell growth after LAT3 overexpression (Fig.
2I; Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4F).
LAT1 regulates PC-3 cell growth
We next examined LAT1 expression in prostate cancer cells.
Western blotting showed low levels of LAT1 in LNCaP cells,
with high expression in PC-3 cells (Fig. 3A). We conﬁrmed that
LAT1 is correctly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B),
with strong expression in the lamellipodia of PC-3 cells (Fig. 3B
arrows), suggesting that LAT1 may also have a function in
regulating cell migration. To examine the function of LAT1, we
used lentiviral shRNA knockdown of LAT1 (shLAT1) in LNCaP
and PC-3 cells, which decreased LAT1 expression by more than
50% in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Fig. 3C). shLAT1 expression
signiﬁcantly reduced leucine uptake in LNCaP (22%) and PC-3
(63%) cells (Fig. 3D) and decreased p-p70S6K activation (Supplementary Fig. S5A). While inhibition of LAT1 expression had
no effect on cell growth or clonogenicity in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3E
and G; Supplementary Fig. S1A), there was a signiﬁcant reduction in PC-3 cell growth and clonogenicity (Fig. 3F and G;
Supplementary Fig. S1A). These results suggested that LAT1 is
the major leucine transporter regulating cell growth in the
androgen-insensitive PC-3 cell line.
To further examine the function of LAT1 in prostate cancer
cell lines, we ectopically expressed LAT1 in LNCaP and PC-3
cells and conﬁrmed this by Western blotting (Supplementary
Fig. S5B). LAT1 overexpression led to signiﬁcantly increased
leucine transport in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Fig. 3H);
however, there was no effect on cell growth or cell-cycle
progression in either cell line (Supplementary Fig. S5C–S5F).
A signiﬁcant increase in the clonogenicity of LNCaP cells was
observed after LAT1 overexpression (2-fold of control; Fig. 3I).
LAT3 expression is regulated by androgen receptor
binding
Elevated LAT3 expression in prostate cancer compared with
normal prostatic tissue has been previously reported (15,
16, 27); however, the pathway leading to altered LAT3 expression is unknown. The presence of high levels of LAT3 in
primary prostate cancer, prostate development (27), and
androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C)
suggested to us that the androgen receptor may regulate its
expression. Indeed, the synthetic androgen agonist R1881
strongly elevated LAT3 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells by
quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR; Supplementary Fig. S6A), conﬁrming previous microarray data (28).
Stimulation of LNCaP cells with various concentrations of
DHT led to a dose-dependent increase in LAT3 expression
shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). LAT3 expression was
also regulated by DHT in androgen-sensitive cell lines MDAPCa-2b and C4-2B (Supplementary Fig. S6B). This effect was
inhibited by the androgen receptor inhibitor bicalutamide in
LNCaP cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that LAT3 expression is
regulated by androgen receptor signaling.

Figure 2. LAT3 is required for LNCaP and PC-3 cell growth. A, LAT3 protein expression was detected in LNCaP and PC-3 cells by Western
blotting, with a-tubulin used as a loading control. B, localization of LAT3 protein was determined by immunoﬂuorescent staining and confocal microscopy,
with nuclei visualized using 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Scale bar, 30 mm. C, expression of LAT3 was inhibited using a speciﬁc shRNA (shLAT3),
with a nontargeting miRNA (shControl) used as a control. LAT3 expression was detected by Western blotting to conﬁrm knockdown in LNCaP and
3
PC-3 cells. D, LNCaP and PC-3 cells expressing shControl or shLAT3 were cultured in leucine-free media with [ H]-L-leucine for 15 minutes to assess
uptake. Data represent mean  SEM, n ¼ 4. LNCaP (E) and PC-3 (F) cells expressing shControl or shLAT3 were cultured in the presence or absence of BCH for
3 days. MTT assay was conducted every 24 hours to determine changes in cell growth. Data represent mean  SEM, LNCaP, n ¼ 3; PC-3, n ¼ 8. G,
LNCaP and PC-3 colonies expressing shControl or shLAT3 were scored after 10 (PC-3) or 12 (LNCaP) days in culture. Data represent mean  SEM, n ¼ 3. H,
LNCaP and PC-3 cells containing empty vector or LAT3 expression vector were cultured in leucine-free media with [3H]-L-leucine for 15 minutes to assess

(LNCaP) days. Data represent mean  SEM, n ¼ 3.

To determine whether LAT3 expression is directly regulated
by androgen receptor, we analyzed androgen receptor chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Seq data from LNCaP cells
grown in CSS medium in the presence or absence of R1881 (our
unpublished data; refs. 29–31). This global survey revealed two
putative androgen receptor binding sites 12.5 kb downstream
from the transcription start site (TSS) of LAT3 within the
second intron [LAT3(þ12.5); Supplementary Fig. S6C].
Analysis of transcription factor–binding sites in this region
revealed two predicted AREs 42 bp apart (Fig. 4B) on the basis
of the canonical class 1 nuclear receptor consensus AGAACAnnnTGTTCT. To verify this result, ChIP was conducted
using an androgen receptor antibody on LNCaP cells grown in
CSS medium in the presence or absence of 10 nmol/L DHT for 4
hours. Using qPCR, we observed a 5-fold enrichment of androgen receptor binding to ARE-III upstream of the KLK3 promoter after the addition of DHT, similar to previous reports
(ref. 32; Fig. 4C). No androgen receptor binding was observed

www.aacrjournals.org

proximal to the LAT3 TSS (0.4 kb and þ0.6 kb) or to an
intronic region in LAT1 containing an unrelated enhancer
element (control; Fig. 4C). A 6-fold enrichment of androgen
receptor binding to the LAT3(þ12.5) enhancer was observed in
the presence of DHT (Fig. 4C). For further conﬁrmation of
LAT3 regulation by androgen receptor, we constructed luciferase reporter plasmids containing wild-type and mutant
versions of this putative enhancer region. LNCaP cells were
transfected with the constructs and cultured in CSS medium in
the presence or absence of DHT for 18 hours. Minimal luciferase expression was observed in the KLK3 ARE-III control or
LAT3 ARE enhancer region transfections in the absence of
DHT; however, a 36- and 63-fold induction in luciferase expression was observed upon the addition of DHT, respectively,
conﬁrming that both regions were androgen receptor responsive. Mutagenesis of LAT3 ARE-I or ARE-II separately, or in
concert, resulted in the abrogation of androgen receptor

LAT1 expression is regulated by AARE signaling
To date, no single regulatory element has been identiﬁed
in the LAT1 gene that accounts for its regulation in normal
tissues and cancer. We observed that LAT1 expression was
increased 2.4-fold in LNCaP cells and 1.5-fold in PC-3 cells
after 3-day culture in leucine-free media, suggesting that it
may be regulated by amino acid starvation (Fig. 5A). Blocking leucine transport by BCH also upregulated ATF4 expression in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6D).
Because LAT1 was shown to have reduced expression in
Atf4/ embryonic ﬁbroblasts (33), we analyzed ATF4 protein expression after 6 hours of culture in leucine-free media
(Fig. 5A). ATF4 controls an important transcriptional program initiated by cellular stress due to amino acid limitation
(14), and the substantial increase in ATF4 expression sug-

gested that LAT1 expression may indeed be regulated by
ATF4. We also observed that both LAT1 (1.9-fold) and ATF4
(3.4-fold) expression were increased in LNCaP cells grown in
CSS (Fig. 5A), suggesting that androgen deprivation may
stimulate ATF4 translation, leading to increased LAT1
expression.
Our analysis of the LAT1 promoter region shows that it is
poorly conserved amongst higher eukaryotes. Hence, we analyzed conserved regions within the LAT1 locus based on
conservation scores and alignments of 28 vertebrate genomes.
We identiﬁed a conserved AARE within the ﬁrst intron of LAT1,
15.7 kb downstream from the TSS [LAT1(þ15.7)], consisting of
the sequence TGATGCAAT (Fig. 5B). The consensus sequence
TGATGnAAn is a composite C/EBP-ATF site bound by the
transcription factor ATF4 (14). We conducted ATF4 ChIP on

PC-3 cells, grown in leucine-containing or leucine-free medium
for 6 hours. We observed a 4.5-fold enrichment of ATF4 binding
to LAT1(þ15.7) when the cells were grown in leucine-free
medium (Fig. 5C). We observed similar enrichment for binding
of ATF4 to known AARE sequences within CHOP, 4EBP1, and
xCT gene loci (ref. 14; Fig. 5C). ATF4 binding was not observed
to the LAT3(þ12.5) enhancer as expected (Fig. 5C), and leucine
deprivation did not increase LAT3 levels (Supplementary Fig.
S6E). To further validate these results, we constructed
luciferase reporter constructs containing a single copy of
a wild-type or mutant LAT1(þ15.7) enhancer and transfected them into PC-3 cells grown in leucine-containing or
leucine-free medium for 18 hours. Luciferase expression
from PC-3 cells in leucine-free medium was 1.8-fold higher
than basal levels in normal medium from the wild-type
LAT1(þ15.7)-containing construct (Fig. 5D). In the mutant
construct, basal expression was reduced, and luciferase
expression induced by leucine deprivation was completely
abolished (Fig. 5D).

LAT expression is coordinately regulated during prostate
cancer progression
We hypothesized that transcriptional regulation of LAT3
and LAT1 expression might explain why LAT1 is strongly
expressed in androgen-insensitive PC-3 cells, whereas LAT3
is strongly expressed in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Also,
these data suggested that microenvironment changes, such as
nutrition deprivation or hormone ablation, may stimulate
cancer development and affect LAT3 and LAT1 expression.
We analyzed LAT1 and LAT3 expression in silico using publically available microarray data from GDS1439 (34), GDS2545
(35, 36), and Holzbeierlein and colleagues (37). Gene expression
of both LAT1 and LAT3 was low in benign or normal prostate
tissue (Fig. 6). In primary prostate cancer tissue, however, LAT3
expression was signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 6A and D), whereas
LAT1 expression remained at low levels (Fig. 6B and E). In
castrate-resistant metastatic cancer tissue, LAT3 expression
decreased (Fig. 6A and D), whereas LAT1 is signiﬁcantly
increased (Fig. 6B and E). After hormone ablation therapy,

Figure 5. LAT1 expression is regulated by ATF4. A, LNCaP and PC-3 cells were grown in normal, leucine-free (Leu), or CSS media (LNCaP only).
ATF4 protein expression was detected after 6 hours and LAT1 protein expression after 3 days by Western blotting. B, LAT1 genomic locus showing
conservation of the LAT1(þ15.7) enhancer within the ﬁrst intron containing an AARE. Known AARE sequences within CHOP, xCT, and 4EBP1
regulatory regions and AARE consensus are shown. C, ATF4 ChIP was conducted on PC-3 cells grown in the presence or absence of leucine for 6 hours. The
presence of genomic DNA from AARE regions within the CHOP, 4EBP1, xCT, and LAT1 genes was examined by qPCR. The LAT3(þ12.5) region was
used as a negative control. Data represent mean  SEM, n ¼ 3. D, luciferase reporter constructs containing a single copy of a wild-type (wt) or mutant (mut)
LAT1(þ15.7) enhancer were transfected into PC-3 cells grown in the presence or absence of leucine for 18 hours to measure enhancer expression of
luciferase. Normalized luminescence values are presented as a ratio of the enhancer-containing construct to empty vector. Schematic of luciferase
reporter constructs are shown. Data represent mean  SEM, n ¼ 3.

LAT3 expression decreases (Fig. 6G), whereas LAT1 expression
was increased (Fig. 6H). These results suggest that decreased
androgen receptor signaling may lower LAT3 expression and
consequently increase LAT1 expression. Analysis of these two
genes together separated primary and metastatic tumors into
distinct groups in all three data sets (Fig. 6C, F, and I).
To conﬁrm this inverse relationship between LAT1 and
LAT3 during prostate cancer development, we conducted
LNCaP xenografts in nude mice, followed by castration.
Tumors were harvested from noncastrated mice (intact), 15
days after castration (Nadir), and about 4 weeks after castration once castrate resistance had developed (castration-resistant prostate cancer). Analysis of LAT3 and LAT1 expression by
qRT-PCR in these samples showed that LAT3 is high in intact
tumors and decreases after castration (Fig. 6J), whereas LAT1 is
low in intact tumors and increases after castration (Fig. 6K).
This is similar to that seen in human samples after hormone
ablation therapy (Fig. 6G and H). Unlike the human microarray
data, however, upon castration resistance, LAT3 is reactivated
and LAT1 decreases (Fig. 6J and K).

Discussion
In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms
that lead to increased amino acid import in prostate cancer.
We have identiﬁed a unique regulatory system that comprises a combination of androgen response and amino acid
stress pathways working in concert to maintain adequate
intracellular amino acid levels throughout prostate cancer
progression.
When LAT transport was inhibited in LNCaP and PC-3 cells,
we observed a decrease in cell growth, coincident with a
decrease in leucine uptake, and decreased mTORC1 pathway
activation. Our results raised the possibility that members of
the LAT family may be increased in prostate cancer to ensure
that adequate leucine is available for activation of the mTORC1
pathway. Direct inhibition of LAT1 or LAT3 in both LNCaP and
PC-3 cells further showed that the decrease we observed in cell
growth was predominantly due to LAT transport activity. The
higher levels of LAT3 in LNCaP cells coincided with a more
dramatic inhibition of leucine uptake and decrease in cell

growth in LNCaP cells subjected to LAT3 knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of LAT1 led to a smaller decrease of
leucine uptake in LNCaP cells consistent with the predominance of LAT3 in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. In contrast,
leucine uptake and cell growth in androgen-insensitive PC-3
cells subjected to LAT3 knockdown was less pronounced. This
is likely due to the predominance of LAT1 in PC-3 cells, as LAT1
knockdown led to a signiﬁcant decrease in leucine uptake, cell
growth, and clonogenicity.
The regulation of LAT3 by androgen receptor adds to an
increasing number of links between the androgen receptor and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Indeed, the combination of a PI3K
and androgen receptor inhibitor has recently been shown to be
effective in PTEN-deﬁcient mouse models (38). Androgen
receptor signaling and the PI3K pathway have also been shown
to regulate each other by reciprocal negative feedback (39, 40).
Inhibition of PI3K pathway in PTEN-deﬁcient prostate cancer
results in activation of androgen receptor signaling, which may
induce LAT3 expression and further activate mTOR signaling.
We have also shown that LAT1 is regulated by the amino
acid stress pathway and ATF4-mediated transcription. There-

fore, when androgen receptor signaling is compromised, for
example, after hormone ablation therapy, the levels of LAT3
would decrease, leading to decreased amino acid levels and
rapid ATF4 translation. Atf4 knockout mice have decreased
levels of LAT1, 4F2hc, 4EBP1, and ASCT2 (slc1A5; ref. 33). We
showed that LAT1 and 4EBP1 are regulated by ATF4 binding to
AARE sites present in their introns, with 4EBP1 playing a role in
suppressing global protein translation in the absence of amino
acids. LAT1/4F2hc and ASCT2 have been shown to cooperatively regulate the inﬂux of leucine into cells and play a role in a
number of cancers (41, 42). Their increased expression because
of ATF4-mediated transcription and translation would restore
the balance of amino acids, allowing cell growth to continue
through the mTORC1 pathway, in the absence of androgen
receptor–mediated LAT3 expression.
Our studies suggest that prostate cancer cells have strict
regulation of amino acid transporters to maintain intracellular
levels of leucine. In this model, androgen receptor signaling
activates LAT3 transcription in primary prostate cancer
(Fig. 7A), increasing LAT3 membrane expression, intracellular
leucine, and ultimately stimulating mTORC1 signaling to drive

cell growth. After hormone ablation therapy in patients, LAT3
expression is decreased. Low intracellular leucine levels will
activate ATF4 translation, which initiates the transcription of
LAT1 and 4EBP1. Once LAT1 protein levels are increased,
intracellular leucine levels are restored and mTORC1 signaling
can again drive cell growth (Fig. 7B). The differences seen in
castrate-resistant metastatic cancer in humans, compared
with castrate-resistant tumors in mice may reﬂect either the
androgen-sensitive nature of LNCaP cells or the differences
between cells at the primary cancer site compared with
metastatic sites.
At this stage, it remains unclear whether LAT1 can regulate
progression to metastasis; however, increased localization of
LAT1 on the lamellipodia of PC-3 cells suggests a possible role.
LAT1 forms a disulﬁde-linked heterodimeric complex with
4F2hc, which is required for plasma membrane localization
(43). 4F2hc has been shown to interact with b1 integrin (44),
which may play an important role in cell adhesion in metastasis (45). Furthermore, the inverse expression of LAT1 and
LAT3 in prostate cancer may not apply for androgen-independent cancers that remain androgen receptor sensitive. For
example, the C4-2B cell line (derived from LNCaPs) expresses
androgen receptor but is androgen independent (46) and

7534

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

expresses high levels of both LAT3 and LAT1 (Supplementary
Fig. S6F). As such, there may be mechanisms other than ATF4
that can increase the expression of LAT1 in prostate cancer.
We have shown that inhibition of either LAT1 or LAT3 can
lead to decreased growth of prostate cancer cells. As such,
LATs may be a viable target for therapeutic intervention in
primary prostate cancer (LAT3) and late-stage prostate cancer
(LAT1). Both LAT1 and LAT3 have overlapping substrate
speciﬁcities but distinct protein-coding sequences, making
them attractive candidates for drug design. While the addition
of simple competitive inhibitors such as BCH alone does not
kill prostate cancer cells, anti-nutrient transporter therapy
may slow cell growth. For slow growing cancers like prostate
cancer, this may be used in combination with "watch-and-wait"
type approaches or current therapies.
