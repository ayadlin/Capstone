BACKGROUND: Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a family member of chromatin remodeling factors. The epigenetic silencing mechanisms of CHD5 in colorectal cancer have not been well studied. METHODS: Here we analyzed CHD5 methylation and mRNA expression in vitro and in clinical samples from African American patients. DNA and RNA were isolated from formalin
fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) colon tissues. DNA was tested for methylation using methylation-specific polymerase chain reation
(PCR) and bisulfite sequencing. RNA was used for mRNA quantification using qRT-PCR. The RKO cell line was treated with 5-Aza-dC
and SAHA. RKO cells were also stably transfected with a CHD5-expressing vector. The transcriptional activity was studied in the 1 kb
upstream region of the CHD5 promoter using the dual reporter assay. We performed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays
using the RKO cell line. RESULTS: In most adenoma samples, CHD5 expression was not detected in contrast to normal tissues. In RKO
cells, CHD5 silencing was associated with DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. CHD5 expression was restored after
treatment with 5-Aza-dC and SAHA. CHD5 reactivation reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The reporter assay indicated that the main regulatory region of the CHD5 promoter is encompassed in the 2489 to 2823 region with important transcriptional regulatory sites (TCF/LEF, SP1, and AP-2). CONCLUSIONS: The CHD5 gene is repressed in all types of adenomas, either
epigenetically or by chromosomal deletion. CHD5 activity is regulated by DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications.

Epigenetic changes play important roles in the initiation and progression of the tissue-specific gene expression.1 These epigenetic mechanisms result from cross talk between DNA methylation and histone modifications and occur through various physiologic and pathologic conditions. The combination of these dynamic interactions leads to different genome
expression outcomes.2-4 Aberrant DNA methylation such as global DNA hypomethylation and regional DNA hypermethylation cause activation and/or inactivation of cancer genes.5-8 Chromatin-remodeling factors such as SWI/SNF can
affect gene expression by disrupting the chromatin structure in an ATP-dependent manner.
CHD5 belongs to a group of SWI/SNF proteins called chromodomain helicase DNA binding (CHD) proteins,
which contain a SWI/SNF-like/ATPase domain, and some members form a nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation
complex that directly modifies chromatin structure and enhances the binding of transcription factors to their binding
sites.9 As such, CHD5, which is located on 1p36, has an impact on gene regulation, and it was shown to be highly methylated in colon cancer tumors of African American patients.10 It is preferentially expressed in the brain and nervous system.9
CHD5 is deleted in neuroblastoma and has been demonstrated to control cell proliferation, apoptosis, and senescence
through the p19/p53 pathway.11 CHD5 expression is regulated by promoter DNA methylation and is silenced or downregulated in primary tumors and cancer cell lines.11,12 In gastric cancer, CHD5 is downregulated through promoter hypermethylation, and it is hypothesized to be a tumor-suppressor gene.13,14 We recently demonstrated that CHD5 is a
direct target in miR-211 regulation of posttranscription in a colon cancer cell line.15 Enforced expression of miR-211 promotes tumor cell growth, at least in part by downregulating the expression of the CHD5 gene.
The formation of adenomas are precursor lesions that generally develop into colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the third
most common cancer in the United States. These types of polyps are the epithelial benign tumors that might become malignant

and lead to adenocarcinoma. The 4 most common adenomas causing CRC are tubular adenoma, villous adenoma,
tubulovillous adenoma, and sessile serrated adenomas. In this
study, we first investigated mRNA expression of CHD5 in
different types of adenoma tissues. Next, we analyzed the epigenetic silencing mechanism by evaluating the DNA methylation level of the CHD5 promoter in these tissues. Finally,
we investigated the molecular functions of CHD5 and its
transcriptional regulation in a colon cancer cell line.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Tissue Samples

A total of 24 normal and adenoma samples from African
American subjects were used after the Howard University
Institutional Review Board’s approval of the study. All
samples were evaluated and subjected to histological diagnosis by expert pathologists. Tissues were collected, and
clinical data were obtained. From 24 FFPE samples, 6
samples were healthy normal colon, and 18 samples were
adenomas, which were collected between 2002 and 2004.
The adenoma samples were classified in 4 different pathological groups: tubular, tubulovillous, villous, and sessile
serrated adenoma.
Cell Growth

We used 2 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines for these
studies, RKO and HTC116. The RKO colon cell line was
selected because CHD5 was methylated, and the HTC116
colon cell line was selected because CHD5 was unmethylated.
CHD5 expression was low in RKO and high in HCT-116
cells.12 Both cell lines are well defined, and they have been frequently used for colorectal molecular biology studies.12 RKO
cells were maintained in MEM medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen). HCT116 cells were maintained in
McCoy’s medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS
and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen).
Stable Transfection

CHD5-expressing (sense plasmid) and -nonexpressing
(antisense plasmid, control [mock]) vectors were used.11
Twenty-four hours before transfection, 10,000 cells/well
were seeded in MEM growth medium without antibiotics. The cells were transfected with 100 ng of plasmid
DNA and 0.6 lL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per
well diluted in 100 lL of MEM medium without serum
and antibiotics. After 16 hours of transfection, the medium was changed with normal medium. The cells were
treated with G418 (900 lg/mL) after 48 hours of transCancer

fection to select for transfectants. The colonies were
selected and isolated after 2 weeks.
Transient Transfection

CHD5 promoter luciferase constructs in a pGL3 vector
were transiently cotransfected with TK-pRL plasmid
(Promega) in the RKO cells. Then 5000 cells/well were
seeded for 24 hours before transfection in MEM growth
medium without antibiotics. The cells were transfected
with 100 ng of each plasmid DNA and 0.6 lL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per well diluted in 100 lL of
MEM medium without serum and antibiotics. After 24
hours of transfection, the cells were processed for the reporter assay as described below.
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay

CHD5 transcriptional activity was tested by the dualluciferase reporter assay (Promega) in the RKO cell line,
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The generic
plasmid DNA (GeneScript) of a 1-kb fragment of the
CHD5 promoter was subcloned into a pGL3-Basic vector.
Deletion constructs from the 1-kb promoter construct
were made in the following series: 823, 489, 400, and 273
bp. A vector containing constitutively expressed Renilla
(TK-pRL, Promega) was transiently cotransfected into
the RKO cell line for 24 hours along with the vectors with
the CHD5 promoter subclones.
Proliferation Assay

The proliferation assay was performed using a Celltiter 96
Aqueous kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were seeded in titrated cells numbering
2000, 4000, 5000, and 10,000 cells in a 96-well plate. Absorbance at 490 was recorded using an ELISA plate
reader.
Cell Migration and Invasion Assay

Cell migration and invasion assays were performed using a
CytoSelect 24-well plate. The cell migration and invasion
assays (8 lm, colorimetric format) from Cell Biolabs, Inc.,
were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Colony Formation Assay

The soft agar colony formation assay was performed using the
colorimetric system of a 96-well cell transformation assay kit
(Cell Biolabs, Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA and RNA Extraction

DNA and RNA were extracted from the cell lines, freshfrozen tissues, and FFPE tissue using a DNA/RNA/protein kit (Qiagen AllPrep Kit) following the manufacturer’s
protocol.

fite sequencing. mRNA expression was determined by
qRT-PCR as described above. For the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, chromatin from RKO and
HCT 116 cells (after 5-Aza-dC and SAHA treatments)
was harvested following the protocol described in the
assay ChIP.

MSP and Genomic Bisulfite Sequencing

ChIP Assay

The primers were designed as previously reported.11 Statistical analysis was performed to detect significant
changes in the frequencies of DNA methylation of CpG
nucleotides between tumor and normal samples.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was conducted as previously described.16 The RKO and HCT116 cell lines were
fixed in 0.8% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 25 C. Following lysis, samples were sonicated using a probe sonicator (Misonix) for 7 cycles (20 seconds per cycle/1 minute
of cooling) at a power level of 3. Chromatin shearing was
optimized to a size range of 200 to 600 bp. Chromatin
(150-200 ng) was immunoprecipitated with antibodies
H3K27me3 (07-449; Upstate), H3K4me3 (ab8580;
Abcam), or rabbit IgG (15006; Sigma). A 5% aliquot was
removed as an input fraction. Enrichment of histone
marks was assayed by quantitative PCR employing SYBR
green master mix (Applied Biosystems) and primers
(region 1, CHD5 H3K27me3 forward, TCTGGAAGAGAAGTCGGAGAGTGA; CHD5 H3K27me3 reverse,

method. Control enrichment was measured by quantitative PCR using primers for RNA polymerase II large subunit (POL II forward, AGATGAAACCGTTGTCCA

27me3 antibodies. All experiments were conducted in 3 independent experimental replicates and 3 qPCR technical
replicates.

Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Analyses of CHD5 Expression

Total RNA (1 lg) from the cell lines and primary tissue
samples was isolated using a DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen).
Single-stranded cDNA was subsequently synthesized using
an ABI high-profile cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems). The primers were designed by Taqman gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems, CA). qRT-PCR was
performed using the ABI 7500 system. The threshold cycle
number was automatically determined by ABI software
(Applied Biosystems, CA). Reactions were performed in
triplicate, and the threshold cycle (Ct) numbers were averaged. The results of CHD5 expression were normalized to
GAPDH (reference gene), which had minimal variation in
all normal and tumor samples tested. Expression fold was
calculated according to the formula DCt 5 2(Ct[test]2Ct[ref]),
where Ct(ref) is the threshold cycle number for the reference gene observed in the tissue, and Ct(test) is the threshold cycle number for the experimental gene observed in the
tissue. RQ is the relative quantification of the DCt
observed in the normal samples versus the DCt observed in
the adenoma samples.
5-Aza-20 -Deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) and
N-Hydroxy-N0 -Phenyloctanediamide (SAHA
or Vorinostat) Treatment

RKO cells were seeded at a low density of 5000 cells/well
in a 24-well plate. The cells were treated with different
concentrations of 5-Aza-dC (Sigma-Aldrich) and SAHA
(Toronto Research Chemical Inc.) in order to obtain the
optimal concentrations of treatment. The cells were
treated with 3 lM 5-Aza-dC for 3 and 5 days. Every 24
hours, 5-Aza-dC was freshly added to the cells. SAHA
(1 lM) was added only once, 16 hours before harvesting
the cells. Total RNA and DNA were isolated and purified by a DNA/RNA AllPrep kit (Qiagen). DNA methylation levels of CHD5 in the samples before and after
treatment were determined by MSP and genomic bisul174

CHD5 Expression in Adenoma Tissues

We applied the MSP method in all samples. Male blood
DNA was used as an unmethylated DNA control, and a
methylated cancer DNA sample or the CpGenome Universal Methylated DNA (IVD) was used as a fully methylated DNA control. Expression of CHD5 mRNA was
analyzed by qRT-PCR. Of the 24 samples, 6 were normal
tissues, and the rest were adenoma polyps. Of the 6 normal samples, 4 had an unmethylated CHD5 promoter
(Fig. 1). Only 1 was partially methylated, and 1 was fully
methylated at the CHD5 promoter, corresponding with

methylation at the CHD5 promoter is common in all adenoma types from African American patients, and this is
associated with transcriptional silencing of CHD5 in
these samples.

CHD5 silencing. In the adenoma samples, there were 5
tubular adenomas (TAs). Of these, only 1 TA showed partial DNA methylation, and CHD5 was expressed in this
tissue. The other TA samples showed either complete
DNA methylation in the CHD5 promoter region or deletion; therefore, CHD5 was silenced. Of the 5 tubulovillous adenomas (TVAs), 2 samples showed active CHD5,
of which 1 had a fully methylated CHD5 promoter, and 1
had a variegated DNA methylation pattern. The other 3
TVA samples showed a methylated CHD5 promoter and
inactive gene expression. Of the 5 serrated sessile adenomas (SSAs), no sample showed CHD5 expression. Of
these, 3 had a completely methylated promoter, and 2 had
deleted CHD5 region. Finally in 3 villous adenomas
(VAs), only 1 showed active CHD5 expression, although
all 3 samples possessed a semimethylated CHD5 promoter. These data suggest that deletion or aberrant DNA

We performed genomic bisulfite sequencing to analyze the
methylation status of the CHD5 promoter in the RKO cell
line. The cell line was then treated with 5-Aza-dC and SAHA
to restore the CHD5 activity by inhibiting DNA methylation
and histone deacetylation. Different concentrations and times
of treatment were tested in order to reach the best nontoxic
conditions of gene reactivation (see supplementary data, pages
22-26). Our data showed that transcriptional activity of
CHD5 was restored 2.7-fold with 3 lM 5-Aza-dC and 1
lM SAHA after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 2A). Demethylation of the CHD5 promoter was tested by MSP and verified
by sequencing (Fig. 2B). The sequencing data for the control
and the treated cells are representations of 10 clones (because
the marks were the same for other 6 clones, 4 are shown
here). To check the role of histone modifications in CHD5
regulation, a ChIP assay was carried out with the activating
marker H3K4me3 and the inhibiting marker H3K27me3 in
2 cell lines, the CHD5-expressing HCT116 cell line and nonexpressing RKO cell line (Fig. 2C). Our data showed that
the activating marker H3K4me3 is highly enriched at the
transcription start of CHD5 (region 2) in the CHD5expressing cell line HCT116 and low in the -nonexpressing
cell line RKO. In contrast, the inhibitory marker H3K27me3
was highly enriched in the CHD5 region 1 in the nonexpressing cell line RKO and low in the same region in the expressing cell line HCT116. These primers (see Materials and
Methods sections) were designed on the basis of the areas of
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 enrichment derived from ChIPseq data generated from the ENCODE consortium. The
H3K27me3 primers were in exon 2 of the gene, whereas
H3K4me3 was adjacent to the transcription start site.
CHD5 Biological Functions in CRC: Stable
Transfection of CHD5-Inducing Vector Into the
RKO Cell Line

Because CHD5 expression may have an important role in
the development and progression of CRC and its role has
not been well understood, we performed biological analysis to identify the consequences of CHD5 expression in
CRC. To analyze the biological role of CHD5 in CRC, a
CHD5 expression vector was stably transfected into the
RKO cell line. As a negative control, the antisense CHD5
vector was stably transfected into the same cell line. Figure

grew as a monolayer when compared with the CHD5expressing RKO cells. RNA and protein analysis of
CHD5 confirmed the expression of CHD5 in the transfected RKO cells (Fig. 3B).
CHD5 Expression Reduced Cell Proliferation in
RKO Cell Line

We compared the proliferation of RKO wild-type cells
(CHD5 is methylated) with the CHD5-transfected RKO
cells at different cell densities. At all cell densities, cell proliferation was reduced when CHD5 was expressed. The

highest fold difference was observed at a cell density of
5000 cells/well. This result suggests that CHD5 suppresses tumor growth in these colon carcinoma cells (data
not shown).

assay according to a similar previous study16 in RKO cells
(Fig. 6). The highest reporter activity was observed in a
region from 2825 to 150. This activity was dropped 2fold by deletion of 336 bp from 2489 to 150. This indicates that the active region encompasses 2825 to 2489 of
the CHD5 promoter, where few putative binding sites of
transcription factors such as SP1 and AP2 were detected
using Proscan TF software.

DISCUSSION
CHD5, a newly identified tumor-suppressor gene,17,18
and its expression is reduced in many tumor types. This
reduction is related to either deletion of the 1p36 region
or epigenetic modification, such as hypermethylation of
its promoter.10,13,19 In our previous study, the epigenetic
silencing of CHD5 was investigated in different CRC
populations. Our findings established a high level of
methylation of this gene in African Americans when compared with whites.10 It is noteworthy that African Americans have a higher incidence of CRC and generally are
diagnosed with advanced and aggressive tumors. Here, we
investigated the epigenetic status of the CHD5 gene at earlier stages of colon carcinogenesis in different adenoma
types, and we characterized its functions in vitro.
CHD is a super family that can be subdivided into 5
subfamilies on the basis of the presence of specific protein
motifs that endow each family of proteins with a unique
function. CHD5 is most similar to CHD3 and CHD4 in
that it contains plant homeodomain motifs and is frequently
deleted in many types of human cancers,20,21 and the
chromatin-remodeling activity of CHD5 is required for
appropriate transcriptional activation of the p19Arf/p53
pathway.17 It is clear that CHD5 deficiency is a common
initiating event in human tumorigenesis. CHD5 is frequently downregulated through promoter hypermethylation
in gastric, breast, ovarian, and glioma tumors, suggesting

epigenetic silencing of CHD5 by methylation may contribute to tumorigenesis in these tissues.11,14
Studies suggest that CHD5 exerts its effect as a tumorsuppressor gene in various malignancies; however, its role in
colon adenoma and cancer was not clear.11,17-19,22 The analysis of its methylation status in several adenoma types and
normal tissues showed an overall high level of methylation
or deletion in most tested samples, and the methylation/deletion status correlated with the lack of expression of the
CHD5 gene. Two of the normal tissues showed some methylation, which was likely a result of some molecular field
effect taking place in these histologically normal tissues adjacent to the adenomas. These findings established the prevalence of CHD5 promoter DNA methylation at earlier stages
in the carcinogenic process. Genes that have the capacity to
affect the expression of multiple other genes would be attractive targets in early stages of carcinogenesis23 The CHD5
gene through its effect on chromatin structure also has the
potential to alter the expression of hundreds of genes, and
any deregulation of its expression could have far-reaching
consequences for tissue homeostasis.
In these experiments, CHD5 expression in the RKO
cell line was restored using 5-Aza-dC and SAHA. However, the restored CHD5 expression (1.7-fold) was still
lower than that observed in the HCT116 cell line, in
which CHD5 was not methylated (5.2-fold). These findings suggest that other regulatory processes might be at
play in the alteration of CHD5 activity and expression.
Indeed, Oliver et al24 pointed to the presence of multivalent recognition of histone tails by the PHD-fingers of
CHD5. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
using antibodies against 2 modified histones, namely,
H3K4m3 (an activating modifier) and H3K27m3 (an inhibiting modifier), revealed that the activating modification
was primarily associated with the CHD5-expressing cell
line HCT116 (CHD5 not methylated), whereas the inhibiting modification was associated with the RKO cell line, in
which the CHD5 promoter was methylated. RKO cells
appear to have CpG islands (CGI) methylation and
H3K27me3 consistent with the data showing coordinate
regulation between DNAme and H3K27me3, which are
both involved in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic gene silencing. However, conflicting data have been
reported and have provided evidence to support the theory
that PRC2 and DNAme cooperate to achieve silencing or,
alternatively, that H3K27me3 and DNAme act antagonistically.25 Acquisition of CGI methylation in cancer has
been found to occur preferentially at genes marked by
H3K27me3 in ES cells.26-28 An unknown CGI-binding
factor could be responsible for recruiting PRC2 to CGIs

that then trimethylates H3K27. This H3K27me3 is recognized by polycomb PRC1 complexes that act to impede
transcriptional elongation, thereby silencing genes.29
This demonstrates the complexity of epigenetic factors
regulating the expression of this gene. Because of the technical difficulty, positron emission tomography could not be
used for the cloning and sequencing. It is worth noting that
we recently demonstrated a role for miRNA-211 in the control of CHD5 expression in CRC in vitro and in vivo.15,24
When we transfected the RKO cell line with a CHD5expressing vector, we were able to restore CHD5 mRNA
and protein to levels comparable to those in CHD5expressing cell lines. The transfected RKO cell line became
less proliferative and less invasive and with a lower migration
potential when compared with parental or mock-transfected
RKO cells. These findings established unequivocally the
tumor-suppressor characteristics of CHD5 in colon tissues.
A tumor-suppressor role for CHD5 has been suggested in a number of other tumor types, including lung,
gastric, and ovarian cancers.11,13,17,19,22,30-33 At this stage,
CHD5 regulation seems to involve multiple epigenetic
processes such as CpG island methylation at the promoter
region, histone modifications, and miRNA. In addition,
genetic processes such as deletion may also be involved, as
is the case in some of the adenomas tested in this study and
many CRC tumors analyzed by aCGH previously.34,35
Through different subcloning steps and dual-luciferase
experiments, we located an area between 2823 and 2423
upstream of the TSS. This promoter region contains some
very important sites for known transcriptional factors such
as TCF/LEF, CREB, SP1, AP-2, and E4F1. The presence
of 2 TCF-binding sites at the CHD5 promoter, one near
the TSS and the other about 823 bp apart from the TSS,
suggests a special regulatory action of TCFs on CHD5 activity. In fact, the TCFs at 823 bp apart from TSS acted as
a negative regulator for the gene activity because the 1000bp construct of the CHD5 promoter showed less activity in
the luciferase assay than in the truncated one. This observation is consistent with previous studies regarding the negative regulatory role of TCFs, in the Wnt “off” state, where
TCFs interact with Groucho transcription repressors36,37
preventing gene transcription. When the region containing
SP1 and AP-2 sites was removed, gene activity decreased
significantly, indicating their role as influential transcription factors in CHD5 activity. The presence of the TCFs,
SP1, AP-2, and other transcription sites suggests an interaction with the Wnt pathway, which plays an important role
in many human cancers including CRC.38,39 Is there a
common underlying mode of CHD5 as tumor-suppressor
activity? We showed the fundamental concept that human

CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion are inhibited by CHD5, and its lower expression is consistent with
tumor-suppressor activity in colon adenomas and tumors
from patients, similar to other cancers.11,17-19,22
We have previously shown that CHD5, ICAM5,
and GPNMB were predominantly methylated in colon
cancer tumors in African Americans compared with
whites.10 CHD5 may be the sole potential gene candidate
to be involved in the early stages of oncogenic transformation and as such may be a useful biomarker for early colon
cancer detection in this high-risk population.
