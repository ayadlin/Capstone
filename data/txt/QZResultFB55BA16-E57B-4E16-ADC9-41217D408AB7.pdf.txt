BACKGROUND: A recent randomized study conducted on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients
demonstrated that concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide added to standard radiotherapy had a survival
advantage compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit of this aggressive treatment,
however, was attenuated in older or poor performance status patients. The aim of the present study was to
verify the activity and the toxicity of temozolomide administration concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy
as first-line treatment for elderly GBM patients, and to explore correlations between clinical outcome and
O6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. METHODS: Newly diagnosed GBM patients 65 years were considered eligible. Treatment comprised radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30
fractions over 6 weeks) plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day), followed by 12 maintenance
temozolomide cycles (150 mg/m2 once a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days) if MRI showed no
enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise, chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or
unequivocal progression. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients (34 males; median age, 68 years; range, 65-82
years) were enrolled. Sixteen patients (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated
(57%) status. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (MST) were 9.5 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 8.6-10.5) and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10-17.3 months), respectively. Mental status
deterioration grade 3-4 was detected in 25% of patients. Leukoencephalopathy was diagnosed in 10% of
patients. CONCLUSIONS: The overall and progression-free survival of patients given concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are greater than in those given radiotherapy alone; however, this regimen incurs a
greater deterioration in mental status. Further randomized trials should, therefore, be conducted to investigate the efficacy and against the toxicity of this regimen as first-line therapy in patients with GBM. Cancer

Chemoradiation in Elderly GBM Patients/Brandes et al

incidence of cancer, especially GBM, has increased in
this age group over the past 20 years. It is particularly
noteworthy that age has been recognized as a poor
prognostic indicator in patients with malignant glioma.2 Consequently, elderly patients are frequently
treated suboptimally or left out of clinical trials. A
combination regimen with standard radiotherapy
(60Gy/30F) plus concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide, shown to have a survival advantage over radiotherapy alone,3 has now become the standard
treatment for GBM patients younger than 70 years.
However, this combined treatment may not represent
the optimal approach in patients older than 70. A subsequent trend benefit analysis demonstrated a decreasing benefit with increasing age, the hazard ratio being
.80 for the 65-71 year age group (P ¼ .340).4 The
aim of the present study was, therefore, to verify the
activity and the toxicity of a combined regimen using
temozolomide concurrent and adjuvant to radiotherapy
as first-line treatment for elderly patients with GBM.
Moreover, because epigenetic silencing of the O6
methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) DNA
repair gene by promoter methylation has been strongly
associated with longer survival in adult patients with
GBM given alkylating agents,5 a further endpoint was
to investigate MGMT methylation status in an elderly
population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Criteria for eligibility were as follows: histological diagnosis of GBM; no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy; age
65 years; Karnofsky performance score (KPS) 70; stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids for at least 2
weeks before start concomitant treatment; neutrophils
1500/lL and platelets 100,000/lL; normal liver function (bilirubin <1.5 fold the upper limit of the normal
range) alkaline phosphatase and transaminases <2.5 the
upper limit of the normal range; serum creatinine <150
mmol/L. A Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)
score of at least 27 was required. Patients with active
infection or other uncontrolled diseases, psychiatric disturbances, and/or a history of cancer other than resected
nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the

uterine cervix were ineligible. The study, approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Padova, was conducted
according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the rules of Good Clinical Practice. All patients
signed a form giving their full informed consent to participate in the study.

Treatment Regimen
Radiotherapy comprised a conventionally fractionated
regimen, a total dose of 60 Gy being delivered in 6
weeks, in a once daily schedule of 2Gy per fraction for
a total of 30 fractions. During radiotherapy, temozolomide was administered continuously at a daily dose of
75 mg/m2. After a 4-week resting period, temozolomide was administered as maintenance therapy once
a day for 5 consecutive days every 28 days at a dose
of 150 mg/m2. A maximum of 12 maintenance
cycles were administered if MRI showed no enhancement suggesting a tumor; otherwise chemotherapy was delivered until complete response or unequivocal
progression.

Dose Modifications
Patients were closely monitored for toxicity throughout
cycles, and all adverse events being recorded and graded
according to the common toxicity criteria of the National
Cancer Institute, version 3.0. (http://ctep.cancer.gov/
forms/CTCAEv3.pdf).
Hematology was performed weekly, while complete
biochemistry was assessed once per cycle, preferably on
Day 28. No dose reduction was allowed during the concomitant treatment.
Chemotherapy was given if neutrophils were
1500/lL, and platelets 100,000/lL; otherwise, treatment was delayed for a maximum of 3 weeks until
adequate recovery. If blood counts analyzed throughout
3 weeks were still unsatisfactory, then treatment was
stopped. In cases of  G3 hematological toxicity at nadir
or reversible G3 nonhematologic toxicity (except for
nausea/vomiting), TMZ was reduced by 25%. If G4
hematologic or G3 nonhematologic toxicity reappeared
notwithstanding dose reductions, or if any type of nonhematologic G4 toxicity was observed, chemotherapy was
interrupted. The use of growth factors to maintain high

blood counts and to administer chemotherapy at fixed
intervals was proscribed. Patients were kept at the lowest
corticosteroid dosage allowed in relation to their neurological status. All patients underwent assessment of cognitive function with a MMSE at baseline and at intervals
coinciding with MRI scans.
Efficacy Measures
Progression-free survival was evaluated from the start of
chemotherapy to progression; median survival (MST) was
calculated from the start of treatment to death for any
reason.
Progression-free survival at 6 months (progressionfree survival-6) and at 12 months (progression-free survival -12) and MST were calculated by using the KaplanMeier method6; differences in progression and overall survival were evaluated by the log-rank test for statistical
significance.
Patients were evaluated for response using clinical
and neurological examinations (performed monthly
before each cycle) and MRI or CT neuroimaging performed at 3 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, and every
2 cycles, or earlier if indicated, according to Macdonald
criteria.7 Neurological status was assessed by considering
signs and symptoms possibly correlated with progression,
as compared with the previous examination, and each variation in daily corticosteroids dosage was recorded.
Patients were withdrawn if they had progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or retracted their consent
DNA Extraction and Methylation-specific
Polymerase Chain Reaction
DNA from 10 lm paraffin sections of cerebral lesion was
modified by sodium bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosine to uracil, according to the procedure of
Herman et al.8 Modified DNA was submitted for methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after a
nested-PCR protocol.9 Because the quality of DNA
obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor
tissue affects the success rate of methylation-specific PCR,
in some cases MGMT methylation status was determined
using an alternative nested methylation-specific PCR
approach, a first pair of primers being used to obtain
smaller amplicons (129bp), for which forward and reverse
primers have been described.8,9
3514

Statistical Analysis
The main endpoint of the present phase 2 study was to
determine the progression-free survival at 6 months (progression-free survival-6). According to the 1 stage design,
our study, with its sample size of n ¼ 53, had a 5% probability of rejecting (a) the hypothesis of a progression-free
survival-6 of 30% (P0) and a 90% probability of accepting
(1-b) the hypothesis of a progression-free survival-6 of
50% (P1). Overall survival and progression-free survival
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method,6 and differences in progression and survival in relation to prognostic factors were evaluated with the log-rank test.
Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox
proportional hazard model. The significance level was set
at P < .05. All calculations were performed using S-PLUS
software (MathSoft, Seattle, Wash).

RESULTS
Patients’ Characteristics
From June 2004 to November 2007, 58 patients (34
males, 24 females; median age, 68 years, range 65-82
years); 29.3% of patients were aged 70 years, and the
median KPS was 80 (range, 70-100). Patients’ characteristics are reported in Table 1. All patients were evaluated for
drug activity and toxicity.
Methylation-specific PCR was performed in 37 of
the 58 patients because adequate paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was not available in 21 cases. Among patients
with methylation-specific PCR assessment, 16 (43%) presented MGMT promoter methylated and 21 unmethylated (57%) status. In this subgroup with available
MGMT methylation status, 27 patients were 65 to 70
years of age, and 10 were >70 years old. Moreover,
MGMT promoter was methylated in 11 of 27 (40.7%)
patients aged <70 years and in 5 of 10 (50%) patients
aged >70 years, but unmethylated in 16 of 27 (59.3%)
patients aged <70 years and 5 of 10 (50%) patients aged
>70 years (P ¼ .61).
Progression-free Survival
All patients were followed up to disease progression. The
progression-free survival-6 and progression-free survival12 was 78.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.8%90%), and 35% (95% CI, 24%-51%), respectively. The

median progression-free survival, which was 9.5 months
(95% CI, 8.6-10.5) overall, was 22.9 months (95% CI,
10-35.9) versus 9.5 months (95% CI, 7-11.9) in patients
with MGMT promoter methylated status and with unmethylated MGMT promoter status, respectively; progression-free survival-6 was 86% (95% CI, 69.5%-100%)
and 76% (95% CI, 60%-97%) in patients with methylated and unmethylated MGMT status, respectively.
At log-rank test evaluation, no significant correlation was found between progression-free survival and sex
(P ¼ .3), type of surgery (P ¼ .27), or age less or older
than 70 years (P ¼ .4), whereas KPS (P < .001) was a significant prognostic factor. Among patients with methylation-specific PCR determination, a significant difference
was found between progression-free survival in relation to

19.6%-50%) and 16% (95% CI, 6%-43.4%) of patients
were alive. The percentage of methylated MGMT promoter status patients alive at 2 and 3 years was 83 (95%
CI, 63%-100%), and 69 (95% CI, 44%-100%), respectively; while in patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter status, these figures were 56 (95% CI, 36%-84%)
and 38 (95% CI, 19%-75%), respectively. At log-rank
test evaluation, no significant correlation was found

KPS (P < .01) and MGMT promoter status (P ¼ .05)
were significant prognostic factors (Fig. 2).

Overall Survival
The median overall survival was 13.7 months (95% CI,

At multivariate analysis, only MGMT methylation
status retained significance (P < .01), thus proving to be
the most important prognostic factor for survival in elderly patients with GBM.
Toxicity
Three patients (5%) interrupted concomitant phase for
grade 4 hematological toxicity: in 2 of these patients, levels returned to normal in 3 weeks and temozolomide was
continued as maintenance treatment, and 1 patient had
persistent grade 2 hematological toxicity 6 months after
discontinuation of concomitant treatment and no further
chemotherapy was given.
Ten patients (17%) discontinued treatment after the
phase of concomitant therapy because of disease progression
in 6 cases, and toxicity in 4 (pulmonary embolism, 2 cases;
prolonged grade 4 hematological toxicity, 2 cases). Grade 2
and grade 3 mental status deterioration were detected in 15
(31%), and 12 (25%) patients, respectively. Patients with
cognitive impairment had a median age of 66 years (range,
65-73); only 1 patient was (8%) older than 70 years of age.
The median time from end of radiotherapy to mental state
deterioration was 6 months. Grade 3 leukoencephalopathy
was demonstrated in 3 patients (6%), with a median time
3516

from the end of radiotherapy to diagnosis of 14 months.
Toxicities are listed in detail in Table 2. Among 12 patients
that presented grade 3 mental deterioration, 9 (75%) had
no comorbidities, 2 (17%) and 1 (8%) patients had 1 and 2
controlled comorbidities, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Radiotherapy could be considered current standard treatment for elderly GBM patients: In a recent randomized
study, it has been demonstrated that, at a dose of 50 Gy
(1.8 Gy per fraction), this regimen has a survival advantage over best supportive care (7.3 vs 4.2 months), without
reducing quality of life or cognition.10
In a previous randomized trial conducted on GBM
patients aged older than 60 years (median KPS, 70; previous surgical resection in 65%), no difference was found
between standard (60 Gy/30F) and short course radiotherapy (45 Gy/15F) for survival, the MST being 5.1
versus 5.6 months, respectively.11
The impact of adjuvant chemotherapy was analyzed
in a trial conducted by Brandes et al, in which 79 elderly
GBM patients with favorable prognostic factors (gross total
resection and KPS 80) were treated with radiotherapy
(60 of 30F) alone or the same radiotherapy followed by adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV), or
the same radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide. Patients who received adjuvant temozolomide had a
median overall survival and median progression-free survival of 14.9 months 10.7 months, respectively.12
The EORTC/NCIC phase 3 randomized trial comparing temozolomide concomitant and adjuvant to standard radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone (60Gy/30F) has
demonstrated an overall and progression-free survival benefit over radiotherapy alone in patients younger than 70
years of age3: the trend benefit analysis showed a decreasing
benefit with increasing age, with a hazard ratio (HR) of
0.63 for patients 50 to 60 years of age (P < .05), HR of
0.72 for patients 60 to 65 years of age (P ¼ .096), and HR
of 0.8 for patients 65 to 71 years of age (P ¼ .340).4
Two studies have analyzed the impact of concomitant and/or adjuvant treatment in the elderly population.13,14 In the study conducted by Combs et al,13 43
GBM patients older than 65 years of age were treated with
temozolomide concomitant with (81% received temozolomide at 50 mg/m2, and 19% 75 mg/m2) radiotherapy

(adjuvant chemotherapy prescribed in only in 5 cases for
unspecified reason); the median OS was 11 months and
the median progression-free survival only 4 months. No
data on MGMT status were provided. In the study conducted by Minniti et al,14 30 patients aged over 70 were
treated with temozolomide concomitant with radiotherapy followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant treatment; the
median survival was 10.6 months and the median progression-free survival was 7 months. No data on MGMT status were provided (Table 3).
In the present study, 58 GBM patients older than
65 years of age were treated with temozolomide concomitant with and adjuvant to standard radiotherapy; the median survival and the median progression-free survival
were 13.7 and 9.5 months, respectively. The prognostic
profile of this population was favorable: 71% of patients
were 65 to 70 years of age; 92% had a KPS of 80-100, and
all had undergone a previous surgical resection. These
more favorable prognostic factors may explain the more
satisfactory findings made in the present paper.
Elderly GBM patients are considered less tolerant to
treatment than younger patients; however, the survival in
the elderly GBM patients with good prognostic factors
treated in our study was similar to that of the adult population treated in the EORTC/NCIC trial3 (13.7 vs 14.6
months); moreover, the percentages of patients alive at 2
years were 31% versus 26%, and different from other previous studies, age (<70 vs >70 years) does not seem to
correlate to progression-free survival or OS in our study.
On evaluating results in terms of MGMT promoter methylation status,5 it emerges that the prognostic and predictive value of MGMT methylation is also maintained in

the elderly population, being associated with a longer progression-free survival and OS.
The dosage of temozolomide (150 mg/m2) given to
our patients during the maintenance period was lower
than that (200 mg/m2) given to the adult population;
treatment was well tolerated and the therapy discontinuation rates and hematological toxicity profiles were
similar.3
However, the neurologic and neurocognitive sequelae found in the present study were important: deterioration in mental status, occurring in 56% of patients, led to
significant disability and compromising quality of life. Of
the patients, 6% had grade 3 leukoencephalopathy. The
risk of cognitive impairment does not appear to be age
related. Patients with cognitive impairment had a median
age of 66 years (range 65-73); only 1 (8%) patient was
older than 70 years of age. The median time of onset to
the development of neurologic toxicity was 6 months,
whereas time to progression was 9.5 months. These findings suggest that disease progression does not play an important role in neurotoxicity and that the burden of
neurocognitive deficits is a crucial issue in elderly patients.
However, it is possible that cognitive impairment was due
to tumor progression and in many trials it was, in fact, the
first indicator of tumor growth. However, lack of an
untreated control arm makes it difficult to determine the
specific contribution of the treatment to neurocognitive
decline.
Nevertheless, the neurocognitive decline, occurring
after concomitant and adjuvant treatment in GBM
patients, is multifactorial because of the disease itself
and age-related comorbidity, and chemotherapy also

playing a role; moreover, concomitant treatment
may exacerbate neurological deterioration in view of
the activity of radioenhancers involved in concomitant
chemotherapy.
The real benefit of concomitant and adjuvant treatment over radiotherapy alone followed by adjuvant treatment has not yet been clearly demonstrated in the elderly
population. Moreover, although it is known that this
approach incurs long-term cognitive impairment, none of
the trials reported in literature made pretreatment and
post-treatment psychometric evaluations of their patients.
A randomized study including specific testing should,
therefore, be conducted to further investigate this aspect;
it may yield data revealing that the real incidence of cognitive deficit in elderly GBM patients given concomitant
radiochemotherapy is even higher than reported so far.
