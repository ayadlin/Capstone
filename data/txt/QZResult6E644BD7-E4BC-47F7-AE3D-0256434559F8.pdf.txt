Abstract
Nanoparticle-based delivery systems provide new opportunities
to overcome the limitations associated with traditional smallmolecule drug therapy for cancer and to achieve both therapeutic
and diagnostic functions in the same platform. Preclinical trials are
generally designed to assess therapeutic potential and not to
optimize the design of the delivery platform. Consequently, progress in developing design rules for cancer nanomedicines has been
slow, hindering progress in the ﬁeld. Despite the large number of
preclinical trials, several factors restrict comparison and bench-

marking of different platforms, including variability in experimental design, reporting of results, and the lack of quantitative data. To
solve this problem, we review the variables involved in the design
of preclinical trials and propose a protocol for benchmarking that
we recommend be included in in vivo preclinical studies of drugdelivery platforms for cancer therapy. This strategy will contribute
to building the scientiﬁc knowledge base that enables development of design rules and accelerates the translation of new technologies. Cancer Res; 75(19); 4016–20. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

the physicochemical properties (e.g., size, shape, composition,
zeta-potential, surface chemistry, etc.) inﬂuence pharmacokinetic
parameters (area under the curve, clearance rate, distribution
volume, and clearance half-time), biodistribution (uptake in
organs), tumor accumulation, tumor size (growth rate), and
survival (Kaplan–Meier curves).
Despite the large number of preclinical trials of drug-delivery
platforms, surprisingly few report quantitative data that would
be useful in developing platform design rules. In a recent metastudy, we reviewed 74 preclinical trials of drug-delivery platforms that reported quantitative values of tumor accumulation
(7) and showed how the variability in experimental design
signiﬁcantly limits the ability to make the comparisons necessary to develop design rules. Speciﬁc problems include: differences in the animal model, inconsistent reporting of tumor
size/weight, inconsistent reporting of dose, inconsistent reporting of physicochemical properties, tumor accumulation
reported at different time points, and variability in controls
(especially for active targeting).
The ability to make comparisons between studies with different
platforms is key to accelerating progress in the ﬁeld and increasing
the impact of the investment in research. To overcome this
problem, we propose a standard protocol that could be included
in preclinical trials to allow benchmarking between studies. In vivo
preclinical trials are time consuming and often expensive, and
hence recommendations for benchmarking should be convenient, limited to a small number of animals, and be limited to
a small number of measured parameters.
Here we consider the variables involved in the design of
preclinical trials, including animal model, tumor size, dose, and
measured variables such as physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetics/biodistribution. We propose a protocol for benchmarking that could be included in in vivo preclinical studies of
drug-delivery platforms for cancer therapy (Table 1). Brieﬂy, we
propose that preclinical trials of drug-delivery platforms should
include measurement of (i) the concentration of the delivery
vehicle in blood and (ii) tumor accumulation in athymic
nu/nu mice with subcutaneously implanted LS174T cells grown

Chemotherapeutics are inherently toxic and hence treatment is
invariably a balance between inducing cancer cell death and
minimizing the adverse side effects associated with drug accumulation in normal tissue and organs (1, 2). Nanotechnology provides the possibility of creating delivery systems where the design
constraints are decoupled, allowing new approaches for reducing
the unwanted side effects of systemic delivery, increasing tumor
accumulation, and improving efﬁcacy (3–5). The development
and translation of new nanomedicines is extremely challenging
and hence progress in the ﬁeld has been relatively slow. Of the six
FDA-approved nanomedicines for cancer therapy, two are antibody–drug conjugates, three are liposomal formations of anticancer drugs, and one is a protein–drug complex (6). Progress has
also been hindered by the largely empirical approach to research
and development (7).
Building a knowledge base is key to advancing a scientiﬁc ﬁeld,
as it enables the development of design rules that, in turn,
accelerate the translation of new technologies. Preclinical trials
of nanomedicines are usually designed to assess efﬁcacy by
measuring changes in tumor size and/or survival rates following
administration in an animal model. However, to develop design
rules for drug-delivery platforms, it is essential to understand how

to a tumor size of 8 to 10 mm in diameter. Experiments should be
performed at a minimum of three ﬁxed time points, at 6, 24, and
48 hours after injection. Tumor accumulation should be obtained
using a suitable quantitative method and reported as %ID and
%ID/g. We recommend that experiments be performed at a dose
of 1013 particles per mouse (approximately 20 g). These additional experiments will typically require 21 mice (typically 7 at
each time point). Data from such experiments will allow direct
comparison and benchmarking of different platforms, and contribute to the development of design rules that will allow more
efﬁcient utilization of research resources and accelerate translation to the clinic.

Animal Models
Rodent models are widely used in cancer research for identiﬁcation of carcinogens, the development of cancer therapies,
and to study the molecular mechanisms of tumor growth and
metastasis. Mouse models have been developed for primary
tumors in most organs or organ systems, as well as models of
metastasis, and include environmentally induced models,
human tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice, and
genetically engineered mice (8, 9). While mice are relatively
inexpensive, they have a blood volume of only about 2 mL and
hence it is difﬁcult to extract sufﬁciently large blood samples for
analysis of the concentration in blood at different time points
from a single animal. Although the fraction of successful preclinical studies that survive clinical trials is very low (10), animal
studies can provide insight into the relationship between physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic parameters. The
predominant mouse models include spontaneous and environmentally induced mouse models, immunocompromised mice
for xenografting, and genetically engineered mice (see Supplementary Information for further details) with varying levels of
physiologic relevance and accessibility.
Recommendation for benchmarking
While genetically engineered mouse models and primary
human tumor xenografts in humanized mouse models represent the state of the art in animal models for cancer research,
they are technically challenging, expensive, and time consuming. These models can recapitulate many aspects of the tumor
microenvironment associated with speciﬁc types of cancer and
hence are important in developing therapies and delivery
strategies for different malignancies. Despite the limitations of
subcutaneous xenografts using immortalized cell lines, these
models are straightforward, relatively inexpensive, and tumors
can be formed within a few weeks. Therefore, for benchmarking
drug-delivery platforms, we recommend a subcutaneous xenograft in athymic Nu/Nu mice.

www.aacrjournals.org

Cell Line
A wide range of human and animal cell lines have been used for
subcutaneous xenografts. Indeed a major problem in benchmarking drug-delivery platforms is the wide range of cell lines used for
subcutaneous xenografts (7). In a recent meta study of nanomedicines that reported tumor accumulation, 68 of 74 studies used
xenograft mouse models (7). These 68 studies used 35 different
cell lines to form the xenografts, highlighting the variability in
experimental design. Several commonly used cell lines are the
4T1, C26, KB, and LS174T lines (see Supplementary Information
for details; ref. 7).
Recommendation for benchmarking
We propose subcutaneous xenografts of 5  106 LS174T cells
injected as suspended cells in 50% growth media and 50% growth
factor–reduced Matrigel. LS174T implants grow reasonably
quickly, reaching about 8 to 10 mm in size after 1.5 to 2 weeks,
and do not have a signiﬁcant tendency to metastasize (11).
Matrigel provides a viscous medium to minimize cell diffusion
away from the injection site and decreases shape abnormalities
during the initial tumor formation.

Tumor Size
Tumor size is an important parameter in analysis of tumor
accumulation when comparing nanomedicines. Small tumors,
typically 1 mm3, are not well vascularized (12) and the normalized tumor accumulation (in terms of %ID/g) is expected to
be less than in a well-vascularized tumor. On the other hand, in
large tumors, the necrotic core may represent a signiﬁcant fraction
of the total tumor volume, resulting in small values of accumulation compared with a tumor where the necrotic core is a small
fraction of the tumor volume. The point at which tumors develop
a necrotic core is highly dependent on their ability to self-vascularize. For details about tumor growth and the EPR effect, see the
Supplementary Information.
In subcutaneous xenograft models, the time dependence of
tumor size is widely used to assess efﬁcacy. Tumor size is
determined from measurement of the smallest and largest
dimension of the tumor and a model of tumor shape (13).
Tumor accumulation, when measured, is usually normalized
by the tumor mass. While direct measurement of the mass of
the resected tumor is preferred, in many cases tumor mass is
determined from the tumor volume and an estimate of the
tumor density. Both volume and density are subject to errors
and should be avoided (13).
Recommendation for benchmarking
We recommend tumors be grown to 8 to 10 mm in diameter
or approximately 0.2 g in weight. This size range is typical for

preclinical studies and provides a relatively large sample for
analysis without a large degree of necrosis. The mass of the
resected tumor should be reported along with the smallest and
largest dimensions for calculation of size using the ellipsoid
formula (13).

Physicochemical Evaluation
To establish design rules for drug-delivery platforms, it is
essential to elucidate the relationship between physicochemical
properties and pharmacokinetics and tumor accumulation.
Important design factors for physicochemical evaluation include
size, shape, surface chemistry, and aggregation state (14–16). All
of these parameters are known to inﬂuence pharmacokinetics,
biodistribution, uptake, and trafﬁcking (17–22).
Recommendation for benchmarking
We recommend that all preclinical studies include characterization of size, shape, composition, surface chemistry, and zeta
potential.

Dose
The dose of a drug is usually determined by the therapeutic
index and hence standardization for preclinical trials is difﬁcult.
The dose of a drug-delivery platform can be based on the amount
of drug administered (e.g., mg of drug per kg of body weight or
surface area), or can be reported as the number of nanoparticles
administered. Reporting drug loading (number of molecules per
carrier) is key to making appropriate comparisons. Similarly, dose
reported as mg of the drug-delivery platform per kg of body weight
is only useful if the mass of a single nanoparticle and the drug
loading are also reported. While radiolabeling is a commonly
used method for imaging and determination of biodistribution,
data are only useful for benchmarking if quantitative calibration
curves are provided to convert radioactivity units (e.g., Curies or
Bequerels) to dose.
There are six FDA-approved nanomedicines for solid tumor
therapy: doxil, marqibo, daunoxome, abraxane, brentuximab
vedotin, and trastuzumab emtansine (Table 2; ref. 6). Doses for
the liposomal drugs (doxil, marqibo, daunoxome) vary from 2 to
93 nmol of nanoparticles for an average human patient (based on
the mass of the drug). All three have a similar drug loading (about
10,000 molecules per liposome). The recommended dose for
abraxane is 100 to 260 mg/m2, corresponding to 2 to 6 mmol of
nanoparticles. The drug loading (10,000 per nanoparticle) is

similar to the liposomal drugs. For the six nanomedicines, the
number of particles per dose varies over about two orders of
magnitude from about 10 nmol to 1 mmol.
Tumor accumulation and biodistribution are often determined
using a radiolabel and hence dose is reported in Curies or
Bequerels. A disadvantage of this approach is that the absolute
amount accumulated in the tumor can only be determined if the
decay in emission of the radiolabel and the number of radiolabels
per particle (for a given isotope) are reported.
To determine a suggested dose for benchmarking, we analyzed published quantitative studies of tumor accumulation in
mouse studies in the literature (see Supplementary Information;
ref. 7). In these studies, the doses ranged from 1011 to 1016
particles per mouse, with most around 1013 nanoparticles/
mouse (or approximately 20 pmol/mouse). This dose, normalized to body weight, is within range of the doses of FDAapproved nanomedicines (Table 2).
Recommendation for benchmarking
We recommend a nanoparticle dose of 1013 particles per
mouse. Dose should also be reported as mass of drug and mass
of drug normalized to the mass of the animal.

Pharmacokinetics/Biodistribution
Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution are sometimes included
in preclinical trials of nanomedicines. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve, clearance rate, distribution
volume, and elimination half-time provide important insight into
stability in circulation, clearance by the kidneys and mononuclear
phagocyte system, and the propensity for uptake in normal tissue.
Biodistribution studies of the accumulation in organs, particularly liver and spleen, provide valuable information concerning
possible toxicity.
For comprehensive comparison of drug-delivery platforms, it
would be desirable to have detailed pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and tumor accumulation data, along with tumor growth rate,
and survival curves under a given set of conditions. However, these
time-consuming and expensive experiments are unrealistic for
benchmarking. As described previously, tumor accumulation is a
parameter that is not widely reported but combines aspects of
pharmacokinetics and extravasation by the EPR effect (see Supplementary Information). Therefore, tumor accumulation and concentration in circulation are key parameters for benchmarking.

Recommendations for Benchmarking

In selecting time points for benchmarking, there are many
competing factors. Circulation half-times for chemotherapeutics
and FDA-approved drug-delivery platforms (Table 2) typically
vary from 4 hours to 4 days (6). Evidence suggests that the
accumulation of a drug-delivery system in a solid tumor increases
with time following administration and subsequently decreases
at longer times (6, 7). However, detailed measurements of concentration in circulation and tumor accumulation at multiple
time points requires a large number of animals and hence is time
consuming and expensive. Therefore, we recommend that blood
concentration and tumor accumulation be measured at three
time points: 6, 24, and 48 hours.
Measurements at 6 hours provide information on the concentration in circulation and tumor accumulation shortly after
administration. This is particularly important for nanoparticle
systems where a sustained concentration in blood is not
required, for example, for imaging. Measurements at 24 hours
provide insight into tumor accumulation at a later time point
relevant for drug-delivery systems where the concentration in
circulation is likely to be considerably lower. Finally, at 48
hours, the concentration in circulation is generally very low,
resulting in a large concentration gradient for transport of
unbound nanoparticles in the tumor back into circulation.
Therefore measurement of concentration in circulation and
tumor accumulation at 48 hours can provide insight into
retention of the drug-delivery system in the tumor. We emphasize that the goal is not to quantify pharmacokinetics or biodistribution, but to allow benchmarking between drug-delivery
systems at different time points.
Recommendation for benchmarking
We recommend that blood concentration and tumor accumulation be measured at 6, 24, and 48 hours. A detailed
discussion of methods for quantitative measurement is provided
in Supplementary Information. We suggest that concentration in
blood be reported as %ID and mg of drug. The tumor concentration should be reported as %ID and %ID/g tumor mass, from
which the mass of the tumor can be inferred. Depending on the
nanoparticle design and cargo, the analytical methods used to
determine blood concentration and tumor accumulation may
be very different. Therefore, appropriate controls, standards,
and/or calibrations should be provided to ensure the validity
of the reported metrics.

Suggested Protocol for Benchmarking
Preclinical Studies of Nanomedicines
Recipient animal and tumor model
Immunodeﬁcient, 4- to 6-week-old athymic nude female mice
are to be housed in a speciﬁc pathogen-free animal facility in
accordance with federal guidelines, including the Principles of
Laboratory Animal Care, along with regulations from each institution's Committee on the Use and Care of Animals.
Tumor cell line
The LS174T human colorectal carcinoma cell line is to be
purchased from the ATCC and maintained in vitro at 37 C, 5%
CO2 in Eagle MEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells should be used only below passage 15. Before injection
in the mice, the cells should be harvested using trypsin-EDTA
solution, washed, and resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension

www.aacrjournals.org

(5  106 cells in 50 mL of growth media and 50 mL of growth
factor–reduced Matrigel) is to be injected subcutaneously into one
ﬂank of each mouse. Tumors are to be allowed to grow for
approximately 1.5 to 2 weeks until reaching a diameter of 8 to
10 mm. Tumor volume should then be computed for the standard
volume of an ellipsoid (13).
Drug administration
Animals are to be injected via lateral tail vein with less than
200 mL solution containing 1013 nanoparticles. Dose should
be reported as the number of nanoparticles injected in addition
to other relevant metrics, such as drug/radiolabel loading, total
drug administered, etc.
Physicochemical properties
The following data should be reported: average particle size,
shape, composition, surface chemistry, and zeta potential.
Biodistribution and tumor accumulation of nanoparticle
At 6, 24, and 48 hours, the animals are to be euthanized and
tumors are to be entirely resected and weighed. Each group
should include a minimum of seven mice. Blood concentration
should be reported as amount (mg) and %ID, and tumor
concentration should be reported as amount (mg), %ID, and
%ID/g tumor.

Conclusion and Future Perspectives
There has been rapid growth in the number of preclinical
trials of drug and gene delivery systems for cancer therapy and
imaging. However, these studies have not resulted in the
development and validation of design rules to the extent that
would be expected on the basis of the number of publications.
It is extremely challenging to move preclinical studies to clinical
trials and ultimately to the clinic, as evidenced by the small
number of FDA-approved nanomedicines (6). However, the
development of delivery systems remains largely empirical and
the lack of standardization of preclinical studies has been a
barrier to establishing robust design rules for nanoparticle
development.
The ability to make quantitative comparisons between delivery platforms is key to elucidating the complex interactions
that relate the properties of the delivery platform to efﬁcacy. In
general, it has been established that drug toxicity can be
reduced by encapsulating the free drug (e.g., liposomes).
Similarly, stability in circulation can be improved by developing strategies to minimize protein binding and evade the
immune system. The efﬁciency of accumulation at a tumor
site can be improved by active targeting of the delivery system
or by increasing extravasation by the EPR effect. However, a
more detailed understanding of the complex interactions of
delivery platforms in the body would greatly accelerate progress in the ﬁeld.
