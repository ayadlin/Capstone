ABSTRACT
Protein hydroxylation is a posttranslational modification (PTM), in which a
CH group in Pro (P) or Lys (K) residue has been converted into a COH group, or a
hydroxyl group (-OH) is converted into an organic compound. Closely associated
with cellular signaling activities, this type of PTM is also involved in some major
diseases, such as stomach cancer and lung cancer. Therefore, from the angles of both
basic research and drug development, we are facing a challenging problem: for an
uncharacterized protein sequence containing many residues of P or K, which ones
can be hydroxylated, and which ones cannot? With the explosive growth of protein
sequences in the post-genomic age, the problem has become even more urgent.
To address such a problem, we have developed a predictor called iHyd-PseCp by
incorporating the sequence-coupled information into the general pseudo amino acid
composition (PseAAC) and introducing the “Random Forest” algorithm to operate
the calculation. Rigorous jackknife tests indicated that the new predictor remarkably
outperformed the existing state-of-the-art prediction method for the same purpose.
For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for
iHyd-PseCp has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iHyd-PseCp, by which
users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the
complicated mathematical equations involved.

INTRODUCTION

HyL sites in proteins is an indispensable step for decoding
protein function. It is also crucially important for in-depth
understanding the physiological roles of hydroxylation.
Meanwhile, it can also provide useful information for
developing drugs to treat various diseases associated with
hydroxylation.
Although the information of HyP and HyL can be
determined by means of large-scale mass spectrometry, it
is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is highly
demanded to develop computational methods to deal
with this problem. In a pioneer work, by incorporating
dipeptide position-specific propensity into the general
Chou’s pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) [7] and

Protein post-translational modification (PTM or
PTLM) is one of the most efficient biological mechanisms
for expanding the genetic code and regulating cellular
physiology. Hydroxylation is one type of PTM that can
take place in proteins to hydroxylate proline and lysine.
Hydroxyproline (HyP) is the key factor in stabilizing
collagens [1, 2], whose instability or abnormal activity
may cause stomach cancer [3] and lung cancer [4,  5].
Hydroxylysine (HyL) is also found in collagen, which
may affect fibrillogenesis, cross-linking, and matrix
mineralization [6]. Consequently, identifying the HyP and

using the discriminant function algorithm used by Chou
et al. for identifying the HIV protease cleavage sites [8, 9],
Xu et al. [10] proposed a predictor called iHyd-PseAAC
to identify the HyP and HyL sites in proteins. Although
these authors did make contribution in stimulating the
development of this area, more work is definitely needed
to improve the prediction quality. And the current study
is to devote to do so by introducing the sequence-coupled
approach.
According to the Chou’s 5-step rule [7] and
concurred by many investigators in a series of recent
publications [11–23], for developing a new prediction
method that can be widely used by broad users, we should
consider the following five points: (1) the prediction
method should be with a web-server accessible to public;
(2) a compelling demonstration to show its prediction
quality being improved over the existing counterparts;
(3) a good benchmark dataset used to train or test the
new model; (4) an elegant mathematical formulation to
represent the statistical samples concerned; and (5) a
powerful algorithm to operate the calculation. Below, let
us address the above points one-by-one.

Users can easily get their desired results by following the
instructions below.
(1)	Open the iHyd-PseCp web-server at http://www.
jci-bioinfo.cn/iHyd-PseCp, your computer will be
prompted with the web-server top-page shown on
its screen (Figure 1).
(2)	In the input box (Figure 1), enter your query protein
sequences. This can be done by either typing or
copying/pasting manner. The entered query protein
sequences should be in the FASTA format. If you
are not familiar with FASTA, just click the Example
button to see what it looks like.
(3)	If you wish to predict HyP sites, check on the Pro
button; if you wish to predict the HyL sites, check
on the Lys button.
(4)	Click the Submit button to see the predicted result.
For example, if you use the sequences of the two
query proteins in the Example window as the input
and check the Pro button on, after clicking the
Submit button, you will see the following predicted
results: (a) The total number of Pro (P) in the 1st
protein (P35248) is 41, of which those located at
the sequence positions 47, 95, 149, 170 and 200
(highlighted with red) are of the hydroxylation site,
but the remaining 36 sites are not. (b) The total
number of Pro residues in the 2nd protein (Q4ZJN1)
is 31, of which those at the sequence positions
31, 34, 40, 58, 61, 64, 76, 115, 151, 160 and 175
(highlighted with red) are of the hydroxylation

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A new predictor and its user guide
A powerful predictor, called iHyd-PseCp, has
been developed for identifying the HyP and HyL sites in
proteins. The new predictor is accessible to the public.

site, but the remaining 20 sites are not. For the
same input sequences, however, if you check on
the Lys button, you will instead see the following
outcomes after clicking the Submit button: (a) The
total number of Lys (K) residues in the 1st protein
(P35248) is 21, of which those located at the
sequence positions 86 and 98 (highlighted in red)
are of the hydroxylation site, but the remaining 19
sites are not. (b) The total number of Lys residues
in the 2nd protein (Q4ZJN1) is 24, of which those
at the sequence positions 73 and 127 (highlighted in
red) are of the hydroxylation site, but the remaining
22 sites are not. It would take about 30 seconds
before the aforementioned results shown on your
screen. Of course, the more number of query protein
sequences or the longer of the sequences concerned,
the more time it is usually needed.

long computational time, you can also use the batch
prediction mode. To do so, just use the Browse
button to select the desired file (in FASTA format
of course) and follow the online instructions.

two opposite angles. When, and only when, both Sn and
Sp of the predictor A are higher than those of the predictor
B, can we say A is better than B [19]. In other words,
Sn and Sp are actually constrained with each other [24].
Therefore, it is meaningless to use only one of the two
for comparing the quality of two predictors. A meaningful
comparison in this regard should count the rates of both Sn
and Sp, or even better count the rate of their combination,
which is none but the score of MCC.
Graphic analysis is a very useful vehicle to deal
with complicated biological systems as demonstrated by a
series of previous studies (see, e.g., [25–50]). To provide
an intuitive comparison of the proposed method with the
existing state-of-the art method [10] by using the graphic
analysis, let us use the Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) graphs [51, 52] as given in Figure 2. In the figure,
the green and red graphic lines are the ROC curves for
iHyd-PseCp and iHyd-PseAAC [10], respectively, where
panel (a) is for the case in predicting HyP sites in proteins,
and panel (b) for the case of HyL. The area under the ROC
curve is called AUC (area under the curve). The greater
the AUC value is, the better the predictor will be [51, 52].
As we can see from Figure 2, the area under the green
curve is remarkably greater than that under the red line for
both the HyP and HyL cases, once again indicating that
the proposed predictor is indeed much better than iHydPseAAC [10]. Accordingly, we anticipate that iHyd-PseCp
will become a useful bioinformatics tool for identifying
HyP and HyL sites in proteins, or at the very least, play a
complementary role to the existing state-of-the art tool in
this area.
Why could the proposed method be able to increase
the prediction quality so substantially? This is due to
the fact that the amino-acid-coupled effects around the
hydroxylation sites have been taken into account via the
conditional probability approach. Similar remarkable
successes have also been observed in predicting betaturns [53], alpha-turns [54], tight turns and their types
in proteins [55], specificity of GalNAc-transferase [56],
HIV protease cleavage sites [8, 24, 57], as well as signal
peptide cleavage sites [58–60].

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The success rates achieved by the new predictor
iHyd-PseCp via the rigorous jackknife test on the 164
hydroxyproline proteins are given in Table 1, where for
facilitating comparison, the corresponding rates obtained
by the predictor iHyd-PseAAC [10] are also listed. Also,
the jackknife success rates by the new predictor iHydPseCp on the 33 hydroxylysine proteins are given in
Table 2, along with the corresponding rates obtained by
the predictor iHyd-PseAAC [10]. As we can see from
Table 1, for predicting the HyP sites, the newly proposed
method has remarkably outperformed the state-of-theart method from all the four angles: overall accuracy
Acc, stability MCC, sensitivity Sn, and specificity Sp.
As for the prediction of the HyL sites, it can be observed
from Table 2 that the new predictor iHyd-PseCp has
significantly outperformed iHyd-PseAAC [10] in Acc
and MCC. Although the rate of Sn by the new predictor is
about 9% lower than that by iHyd-PseAAC, interestingly
the rate of Sp by the new predictor is about 16% higher
than that by iHyd-PseAAC.
It is instructive to point out that, of the four metrics,
the most important are the Acc and MCC [11, 12, 21, 22]:
the former reflects the overall accuracy of a predictor;
while the latter, its stability in practical applications. The
metrics Sn and Sp are used to measure a predictor from

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Benchmark dataset
The benchmark dataset used in this study was derived
from the same proteins as used by Xu et al. [10]. They
consist of 164 hydroxyproline proteins and 33 hydroxylysine
proteins. The former were used to construct the benchmark
dataset for studying the HyP sites, while the latter used to
construct the benchmark dataset for studying the HyL sites.
To make the description mathematically more
rigorous and clear, the Chou’s scheme [61] was adopted
to formulate peptide samples, as done recently by many
authors in studying the nitrotyrosine sites [62], methylation
sites [63], protein-protein interaction [64], and protein44312

protein binding sites [65]. According to Chou’s scheme, a
potential hydroxylation site-containing peptide sample can
be generally expressed by

Pξ () = R −ξ R − ( ξ−1)  R −2 R −1  R +1R +2  R + ( ξ−1) R +ξ

that have P (Pro) at the center. (2) If the upstream or
downstream in a protein sequence was less than ξ or
greater than L − ξ where L is the length of the protein
sequence concerned, the lacking amino acid was filled
with a dummy residue X. (3) The peptide segment samples
thus obtained were put into the positive subset if their
centers have been experimentally annotated as the
hydroxylation sites; otherwise, into the negative subset.
(4) The peptide samples thus obtained were subject to a
screening procedure to window those that were identical
to any other in a same subset; excluded from the
benchmark dataset were also those that were self-conflict,
namely, occurring in both hydroxylation group and nonhydroxylation group.
By following the same procedures but using the 33
hydroxylysine proteins and focusing on K (Lys), instead of
the 164 hydroxyproline proteins and P (Pro), we obtained
the benchmark dataset  ξ ( K ) .
Because the length of peptide sample Pξ () is
2ξ + 1 (see Eq.1), the benchmark dataset with different ξ
value will contain peptide segments with different number
of amino acid residues, as illustrated below

(1)

where the symbol  denotes the single amino acid
code P or K, the subscript ξ is an integer, R −ξ represents
the ξ -th upstream amino acid residue from the center, the
R +ξ the ξ -th downstream amino acid residue, and so
forth. The (2ξ + 1) -tuple peptide sample Pξ () can be
further classified into the following two categories:
Pξ+ (  ) , if its center is a hydroxylation site

	 (2)
Pξ (  ) ∈ 
P −  , other wise
 ξ ( )

where Pξ (  ) denotes a true hydroxylation segment with
−
P or K at its center, Pξ (  ) a false hydroxylation segment
with P or K at its center, and the symbol ∈ means “a
member of” in the set theory.
In literature the benchmark dataset usually consists
of a training dataset and a testing dataset: the former is
used for training a model, while the latter for testing the
model. But as pointed out in a comprehensive review [66],
there is no need to artificially separate a benchmark dataset
into the two parts if the prediction model is examined by
the jackknife test or subsampling (K-fold) cross-validation
since the outcome thus obtained is actually from a
combination of many different independent dataset tests.

Sequence-coupled information and general
PseAAC
With the avalanche of biological sequence generated
in the post-genomic age, one of the most important
problems in computational biology is how to formulate
a biological sequence with a discrete model or a vector,
yet still considerably keep its sequence pattern or order
information. This is because all the existing machinelearning algorithms can only handle vector but not
sequence samples, as elaborated in [67].
To address this problem, the pseudo amino acid
composition [68, 69] or PseAAC was proposed. Ever since
the concept of pseudo amino acid composition or Chou’s
PseAAC [70–72] was proposed, it has rapidly penetrated
into nearly all the areas of computational proteomics (see,
e.g., [73–80] as well as a long list of references cited in
[81, 82]) and many biomedicine and drug development
areas [67, 83–86]. Because it has been widely and
increasingly used, recently three powerful open access
soft-wares, called ‘PseAAC-Builder’ [70], ‘propy’ [71],
and ‘PseAAC-General’ [81], were established: the former
two are for generating various modes of Chou’s special
PseAAC; while the 3rd one for those of Chou’s general
PseAAC [7], including not only all the special modes
of feature vectors for proteins but also the higher level
feature vectors such as “Functional Domain” mode (see
Eqs. 9–10 of [7]), “Gene Ontology” mode (see Eqs.
11–12 of [7]), and “Sequential Evolution” or “PSSM”
mode (see Eqs.13–14 of [7]). Inspired by the successes
of using PseAAC to deal with protein/peptide sequences,
three web-servers [87–89] were developed for generating
various feature vectors for DNA/RNA sequences as well.
Particularly, recently a powerful web-server called Pse-inOne [90] has been developed that can be used to generate
any desired feature vectors for protein/peptide and DNA/
RNA sequences according to the need of users’ studies.
According to the general PseAAC [7], the peptide
sequence of Eq.1 can be formulated as

In Eq.7

p−+10 (R −10 | R −9 ) is the conditional
probability of amino acid R −10 occurring at the left 1st
position (see Eq.1) given that its closest right neighbor is
R −9 , p−+9 (R −9 | R −8 ) is the conditional probability of
amino acid R 9 occurring at the left 2nd position given that
its closest right neighbor is R −8 , and so forth. Note that in
Eq.7, only p−+1 (R −1 ) and p++1 (R +1 ) are of non-conditional
probability since the right neighbor of R −1 and the left
neighbor of R +1 are always  (namely Pro for the case of
HyP, or Lys for the case of HyL). All these probability
values can be easily derived from the positive training
subsets taken from Supporting Information S1 and S2,
respectively, as done in [9]. Likewise, the components in
Eq.8 are the same as those in Eq.7 except for that they are
derived from the negative training subsets in Supporting
Information S1 and S2, respectively.

most commonly used type of random forests, split selection

the features using Gini importance that is implemented with
the machine learning platform scikit-learn. The detailed
procedures of RF and its formulation have been very clearly
described in [94], and hence there is no need to repeat here.
For the current study, all the involved peptide
samples were converted into a 20-D (dimensional) vector
according to Eq.6, and then entered into the RF operation
engine as the input. And the output would indicate whether
the center residue  of the query peptide is a
“hydroxylation site” or “non-hydroxylation site”. Note
that, in using the current prediction method, one must
observe the self-consistency principle: if the center residue
of a query peptide is  = P, then the corresponding
training data must be taken from  ξ=10 ( P ) ; if the center
residue of a query peptide is  = K, then the training data
must be taken from  ξ=10 ( K ) .

intuitive and easier-to-understand, particularly for the

investigators (see, e.g., [11, 12, 16, 18, 19, 21–23, 64, 65,
99–108]).
Note that, however, the set of equations defined
in Eq.9 is valid only for the single-label systems. For
the multi-label systems whose emergence has become
more frequent in system biology [109–111] and system
medicine [112], a completely different set of metrics are
needed as elaborated in [113].

The predictor established via the above procedures
is called “iHyd-PseCp”, where “i” stands for “identify”,
“Hyd” for “hydroxylation site”, “Pse” for “general
PseAAC”, and “Cp” for “sequence coupled effect”.
As pointed out in the Introduction section, one of the
keys in establishing a useful predictor is how to properly
evaluate its anticipated success rates. To realize this, we
need to consider the following two things: one is what
metrics or scales should be used to quantitatively measure
its prediction quality; the other is what validation method
should be adopted to calculate or derive the metrics values.
Below, let us address the two problems.

A set of four metrics
The following four metrics are usually used in
literature to measure the quality of binary classification:
(1) overall accuracy or Acc; (2) Mathew’s correlation
coefficient or MCC; (3) sensitivity or Sn; and (4)
specificity or Sp (see, e.g., [95]). Unfortunately, the
conventional formulations for the four are not intuitive
and that most experimental scientists feel difficult to
understand them, particularly for the one of MCC.
Interestingly, by using the Chou’s symbols and derivation
in studying signal peptides [96], the aforementioned four
metrics can be easily converted into a set of following
equations [97, 98]:

Jackknife test
With a set of well-defined metrics to measuring
the quality of a predictor, the next thing is what kind of

validation method should be used to score these metrics.
In predictive analytics, the following three cross-validation
methods are often used: (1) independent dataset test, (2)
subsampling (or K-fold cross-validation) test, and (3)
jackknife test [114]. Of these three, however, the jackknife
test is deemed the least arbitrary that can always yield a
unique outcome for a given benchmark dataset as elucidated
in [7]. Accordingly, the jackknife test has been widely
recognized and increasingly used by investigators to
examine the quality of various predictors (see, e.g., [73–76,
78–80, 115–123]). Therefore, the jackknife test was also
adopted in this study to score the metrics of Eq.9. In the
jackknife test, each of the samples in the benchmark dataset
is singled out one-by-one and tested by the predictor trained
with the remaining samples. During the jackknifing process,
both the training dataset and testing dataset are literally
open, and each sample is in turn moved between the two.
The jackknife test can exclude the “memory” effect; it
can also avoid the arbitrariness problem occurring in the
independent dataset test and subsampling test as pointed out
in [7] because the outcome obtained by the jackknife test is
always unique for a given benchmark dataset.

The iHyd-PseCp predictor is a new bioinformatics tool
for identifying the hydroxylation sites in proteins. Compared
with the existing state-of-the-art predictor in this area, its
prediction quality is much better, with remarkably higher
overall accuracy and stability. For the convenience of most
experimental scientists, we have provided its web-server and
a step-by-step guide, by which users can easily obtain their
desired results without the need to go through the detailed
mathematics. The reason of including them in this paper
is for the integrity of the new prediction method, and that
these techniques, such as incorporating the sequence-coupled
approach into the general PseAAC, may be of use as well in
developing other tools in computational biology.
We anticipate that iHyd-PseCp will become a very
useful high throughput tool for both basic research and
drug development in the areas relevant to the protein
hydroxylation.
