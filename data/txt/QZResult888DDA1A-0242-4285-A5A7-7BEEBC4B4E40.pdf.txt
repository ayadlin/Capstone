Abstract
Type II endometrial cancer, which mainly presents as serous and clear cell types, has proved to be the most
malignant and recurrent carcinoma among various female genital malignancies. The transcription factor Nrf2
was first described as having chemopreventive activity. Activation of the Nrf2-mediated cellular defense
response protects cells against the toxic and carcinogenic effects of environmental insults by upregulating
an array of genes that detoxify reactive oxygen species and restore cellular redox homeostasis. However,
the cancer-promoting role of Nrf2 has recently been revealed. Nrf2 is constitutively upregulated in several
types of human cancer tissues and cancer cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of Nrf2 expression sensitizes
cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, the constitutive level of Nrf2 was compared in different
types of human endometrial tumors. It was found that Nrf2 was highly expressed in endometrial serous
carcinoma (ESC), whereas complex hyperplasia and endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) had no or
marginal expression of Nrf2. Likewise, the ESC-derived SPEC-2 cell line had a higher level of Nrf2 expression
and was more resistant to the toxic effects of cisplatin and paclitaxel than the Ishikawa cell line, which was
generated from EEC. Silencing of Nrf2 rendered SPEC-2 cells more susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs,
whereas it had a limited effect on Ishikawa cells. Inhibition of Nrf2 expression by overexpressing Keap1 sensitized SPEC-2 cells or SPEC-2–derived xenografts to chemotherapeutic treatments using both cell culture and
severe combined immunodeficient mouse models. Collectively, we provide a molecular basis for the use of
Nrf2 inhibitors to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and to combat chemoresistance, the biggest
obstacle in chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 70(13); 5486–96. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynecologic malignancies in the world. According to the statistics
from the American Cancer Society, 42,160 new cases and
7,780 deaths occurred in 2009 (1). Extensive epidemiologic,
molecular, and behavioral information suggests that there
are two distinct forms of endometrial cancer, referred to
as type I and type II. Type I is classified by endometrioid
histology and type II consists of serous and clear cell carcinomas. Type I comprises 70% to 80% of newly diagnosed

cases of endometrial cancer, whereas type II comprises only
15% (2–4). Typically, patients diagnosed with type I have a
relatively good prognosis, whereas type II has a disproportionally higher death rate. The dismal prognosis for type II
endometrial cancer is attributed to its highly aggressive nature, rapid cancer developmental, lack of early diagnostic
methods, a high recurrence rate, and a high incidence of
chemoresistance (5, 6).
Many chemopreventive compounds are able to enhance
the expression of Nrf2, a master regulator of an array of genes
containing an enhancer sequence known as the antioxidant
response element (ARE; refs. 7–13). ARE-bearing genes can
be categorized into three major classes: (a) intracellular
redox-balancing genes, such as glutamate cysteine ligase
(GCLC and GCLM) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1); (b) phase
II detoxifying genes, including glutathione S-transferase and
NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1); and (c) genes
encoding transporters, such as multidrug resistant proteins
(MRP) and xCT (8, 11, 14). Based on the functions of these
ARE-bearing genes, it is apparent that activation of Nrf2 target genes should enhance the detoxification and removal of
xenobiotics, such as pharmacologic agents, toxicants, and
carcinogens. Indeed, activation of Nrf2 confers protection
against many chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, high-fat diet–induced obesity, lung inflammation and fibrosis, and diabetic nephropathy (11, 15–21).
Furthermore, the beneficial effects of many chemopreventive

Nrf2 and Chemoresistance in Endometrial Cancer

compounds rely on the activation of the Nrf2-mediated
antioxidant response, as shown experimentally in Nrf2deficient mice, which were unresponsive to chemopreventive compounds (22). Mechanistic studies have shown that
Nrf2 is tightly regulated, primarily at the protein level, by a
negative regulator named Keap1 (23). Under basal conditions, low levels of Nrf2 are maintained by constant degradation of Nrf2 through the Keap1-dependent ubiquitination
and proteasomal machinery. Chemopreventive compounds
are able to stabilize Nrf2 through inhibition of Nrf2 degradation, thus enhancing the protein level of Nrf2 and activating the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response (24, 25).
Recently, the dark side of Nrf2 has been revealed (26).
Many mutations in Nrf2 or Keap1 that disrupt the Keap1Nrf2 interaction have been identified in several cancer tissues
and cancer cell lines (27–30). We have reported that Nrf2 is,
at least in part, responsible for chemoresistance, as shown by
our findings that overexpression of Nrf2 enhanced chemoresistance whereas knockdown of Nrf2 sensitized cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic drugs in neuroblastoma, breast, and
lung cancer cell lines (31). Consistent with this notion,
Kwak's group provided evidence that inhibition of Nrf2 sensitized ovarian carcinoma cells to cisplatin and doxorubicin
(32, 33). Most importantly, Biswal's group showed that xenografts derived from Nrf2-silenced lung cancer cells had an
enhanced response to carboplatin in vivo compared with
control (34). In this study, the level of Nrf2 expression was
compared among the different stages of human endometrial
tumors. It was concluded that Nrf2 expression highly correlated with the aggressiveness and chemoresistance of the
cancer type, with 90% of ESC tissues showing Nrf2 overexpression. The role of Nrf2 in chemoresistance was further
supported by the fact that SPEC-2 cells, expressing a higher
level of Nrf2 than Ishikawa cells, were more resistant to cisplatin and paclitaxel than Ishikawa cells. Moreover, inhibiting Nrf2 expression rendered SPEC-2 cells or SPEC-2–derived
xenografts more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs, providing strong evidence that inhibiting Nrf2 to overcome chemoresistance holds a great promise.

Materials and Methods
Case selection, tissue handling, and pathologic analysis
One hundred seventeen (117) hysterectomy specimens
were studied. These included 46 ESC, 51 EEC, and 20 benign
uteri that were resected for a variety of benign indications.
The cases that were reviewed in this study included only
slides that had adjacent noncancerous endometrium. No patient with a history of prior radiation or chemotherapy was
included in the study. In patients with benign diseases, no
personal history of cancer or transplantation therapy was
indicated. Any patient with a known history of hormone
replacement was excluded. Tissue obtained was formalin
fixed and paraffin embedded. The histologic sections containing both benign endometrium and cancerous areas for
all the cancer cases were processed. The diagnosis and histologic classification of the endometrial carcinomas was
made using the criteria proposed by WHO.

Nrf2 immunohistochemical analysis
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for Nrf2 protein
expression was done as described previously (35). A monoclonal antibody against human Nrf2 (IgG2) was purchased
from Abcam, Inc. Sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) was used as
an antigen retrieval solution. A section of lung carcinoma,
previously confirmed to have overexpressed Nrf2 protein,
was included in every experiment as a positive control. A
negative control was carried out by replacing primary antibodies with class-matched mouse IgG proteins on a section.
All slides were evaluated in a blinded manner for the percentage (P) of positively stained cells and the intensity (I) of
the staining. The intensity was arbitrarily divided into four
categories (0–3) and was judged based on the positive control. Staining index was calculated according to the following formula: Index of Nrf2 expression = P × I. Only those
cases whose indices were more than 25 were regarded as
positive.
Cell culture, transient transfection of small interfering
RNA, and establishment of stable cell lines
All the chemicals used in this study, including cisplatin
and paclitaxel, were purchased from Sigma. Ishikawa cells,
which were derived from well-differentiated endometrioid
carcinoma, were bought from the American Type Culture
Collection. SPEC-2 cells, which were derived from ESC, were
kindly provided by Dr. Janet Price at The University of Texas
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX; ref. 36). Nrf2
small interfering RNA (siRNA) and Hiperfect transfection
reagent were purchased from Qiagen. Transfection of Nrf2
siRNA was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. SPEC-2–derived stable cell lines, with stable incorporation of Keap1-CBD or an empty vector, were established
using a retrovirus system as described previously (31). Stable
SPEC-2 cell lines were continuously cultured in medium
containing 1.5 μg/mL puromycin (Sigma).
Immunoblot analysis
The antibodies for Keap1, NQO1, HO-1, γ-GCS, Keap1,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and
β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
The anti-CBD antibody (New England Biolabs) and Ki67
antibody (Vector Lab) were purchased from commercial
sources. Immunoblot analysis for cultured cells and tissues
was performed as previously reported (37).
Cell viability assay, apoptotic cell death, NQO1 activity,
and glutathione level
Cell survival was measured by MTT assay as reported
previously (31). An in situ cell death detection kit (Roche)
was used for detecting apoptotic cell death in tumor tissue
according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed
under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Observer Z1, Marianas Digital Microscopy workstation). NQO1 activity was
measured as the dicoumarol-inhibitable fraction of DCPIP
reduction (31). The intracellular glutathione concentration
was measured using QuantiChrom glutathione assay kit
from BioAssay Systems (31). All the experiments were done

in triplicate to obtain means and SDs, and data are presented as mean ± SD.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR
Total mRNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) conditions have
been previously reported (37). TaqMan probes were from
the universal probe library (Roche): hNrf2 (#70), hKeap1
(#10), hNQO1 (#87), hHO-1 (#25), hMRP2 (#25), hGCLC
(#25), hGCLM (#18), and hGAPDH (#25). Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and their sequences are listed in Table 1. Duplicated reactions were
performed for each sample and the same experiment was
repeated twice. GAPDH was included as a reference gene.
Endometrial serous carcinoma models in severe
combined immunodeficient mice
Two SPEC-2–rived cell lines (SPEC-2-control and SPEC2-Keap1+) were harvested and resuspended at a concentration
of 1 × 107 cells/200 μL sterile saline. Mice (16 per group) were
injected s.c. in the subdermal space on the medial side of the
thigh just above the level of the stifle with 1 × 107 SPEC-2-control
or SPEC-2-Keap1+ cells at the age of 6 weeks. Mice injected
with control cells or Keap1+ cells were further divided into
two groups: one treated with saline and the other with cisplatin. Mice were given saline or cisplatin (2 mg/kg per mice) i.p.
every other day for a total of 10 days (five injections in total).
Tumor volume (mm3) was measured every other day and
calculated using the formula (a2 × b)/2 (a, the smallest diameter; b, the largest diameter). Mice were sacrificed 24 days after
cell injection. Tumors were dissected and weighed. Formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections were used for
IHC and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis, whereas snapfrozen tissues were subjected to immunoblot analysis.

Statistical test
Results are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical tests were
done with SPSS 10.0. Unpaired Student's t tests were used to
compare the means of two groups. One-way ANOVA was applied to compare the means of three or more groups. P < 0.05
was considered to be significant.

Results
Selected clinical and pathologic features
The age of patients undergoing hysterectomies for cancer
ranged from 45 to 91 years with a mean of 58 years. The
mean age of patients with ESC was 65 years (range, 58–91),
whereas the mean age of patients with EEC was 57 years
(range, 45–77). The average age of patients with positive
Nrf2 expression ranged from 50 to 79 years with a mean of
59 years. All but 23 cancer patients presented had postmenopausal bleeding. Among the 23 patients who did not have
postmenopausal bleeding, 15 had an abnormal pap smear,
6 had an increased endometrial stripe thickness found by
ultrasound, and 2 were found to have a pelvic mass by a routine pelvic examination. Among the benign control group,
average patients' age ranged from 46 to 82 years with an
average age of 58 years.
Endometrial serous carcinoma had elevated
Nrf2 expression
A total of 117 cases including 46 ESC, 51 EEC, and 20 benign endometria were studied. H&E staining was examined
to differentiate the type of endometrial tumors. Representative images are shown (Fig. 1A-a, c, and e). A consecutive tissue section from the same patient was also analyzed for Nrf2
expression by IHC (Fig. 1A-b, d, and f). Nrf2 expression was
scored as positive or negative for each case according to the
criteria described in Materials and Methods. The data are
summarized in Table 2. Among the 46 ESC cases, 41 (89%)
were positive for Nrf2 expression. In contrast, Nrf2 was only
expressed in 14 of 51 (28%) EEC cases. The difference in Nrf2
expression was statistically significant between the two types
of endometrial cancer (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, there was
no Nrf2 expression in all 20 benign endometria consisting
of 5 atrophic, 5 weakly proliferative, 6 proliferative, and 4
hyperplastic endometria. These results implicate a strong
correlation between elevated Nrf2 expression and the aggressiveness of cancer, indicated by higher Nrf2 expression in
type II endometrial cancer tissues. Furthermore, overexpression of Nrf2 correlated with high expression of HO-1, a Nrf2
target gene. HO-1 was highly expressed in ESC tissue sections
whereas there was no expression detected in benign tissue
sections (Fig. 1B). These data show that Nrf2 was functional
in ESC and was able to activate its downstream genes.
SPEC-2 cells express a higher level of Nrf2 than
Ishikawa cells and are more resistant to
chemotherapeutic drugs
To investigate if there is a correlation between basal Nrf2
protein level and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, two
cell lines, Ishikawa and SPEC-2, were used. Ishikawa and

higher levels of Nrf2, NQO1, and γ-GCS compared with Ishikawa under both basal and induced conditions (Fig. 2B, compare lane 1 with lane 3 and lane 2 with lane 4). Consistent
with a decrease in Keap1 mRNA, there was a decrease in
Keap1 protein level in SPEC-2 compared with Ishikawa
(Fig. 2B, Keap1 and the bar graph). Next, the sensitivity of
these two cell lines to cisplatin and paclitaxel, two commonly
used chemotherapeutic drugs for treating endometrial carcinoma, was measured. Ishikawa cells were more sensitive to
cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment than SPEC-2 (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these data establish a correlation between the level
of Nrf2 and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.
Transient silencing of endogenous Nrf2 enhanced the
sensitivity of SPEC-2 to chemotherapeutic drugs
To further explore the role of Nrf2 in chemoresistance,
Nrf2 was knocked down by transient transfection of Nrf2
siRNA into Ishikawa and SPEC-2 cell lines. As shown
in Fig. 3, the protein level of Nrf2 was reduced significantly
in both cell types, as well as the levels of NQO1 and γ-GCS
(Fig. 3A, compare lane 1 with lane 2 and lane 3 with lane 4).
Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2B, the basal level
of Nrf2 in SPEC-2 cells is higher than that in Ishikawa cells
(Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 3). Next, the effect of Nrf2
knockdown on cell resistance to therapeutic drugs was
assessed. Knockdown of Nrf2 in Ishikawa cells did not significantly affect cell viability in response to cisplatin or paclitaxel
(Fig. 3B, left). In contrast, silencing of Nrf2 in SPEC-2 cells
significantly sensitized SPEC-2 cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel (Fig. 3B, right). It is conceivable that the substantial
effect of Nrf2 knockdown in SPEC-2 is due to the higher basal
level of Nrf2 in this cell line compared with Ishikawa.

Figure 1. Type II endometrial cancer had elevated Nrf2 expression.
A, left, H&E staining; right, IHC staining with a monoclonal Nrf2 antibody.
No Nrf2 expression was detected in benign tumors or in EEC. However,
Nrf2 staining was observed in ESC. B, two consecutive tissue sections
were analyzed by IHC for Nrf2 (left) and HO-1 (right).

SPEC-2 were isolated from tumors of patients with type I
(EEC) or type II (ESC) endometrial carcinomas, respectively.
Although no difference in Nrf2 mRNA transcription was
observed (Fig. 2A, Nrf2), the mRNA expression of Nrf2 downstream genes, including NQO1, HO-1, MRP2, GCLC, and
GCLM, were increased in SPEC-2 cells (Fig. 2A), indicating
the activation of the Nrf2-mediated response. Transcription
of MRP2 was increased almost 9-fold in SPEC-2 cells compared with that in Ishikawa cells. Interestingly, Keap1 mRNA
was decreased about 30% in SPEC-2 cells compared with
Ishikawa cells (Fig. 2A). Next, the protein levels of Nrf2 and
two of its downstream genes were measured under basal and
tert-butylhydroquinone–induced conditions. SPEC-2 had

Establishment of a stable SPEC-2 cell line
overexpressing Keap1
Transient silencing of Nrf2 sensitized SPEC-2 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs; therefore, SPEC-2 was used to establish
a stable cell line in which Keap1 was overexpressed. Expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes, as well as their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, were compared between
vector-containing (control) and Keap1-CBD–containing
(Keap1 + ) cell lines. Overexpression of Keap1-CBD did
not affect the mRNA level of Nrf2 (Fig. 4A, Nrf2), which is

consistent with the established notion that Keap1-mediated
negative control is primarily at the level of Nrf2 protein stability. Stable incorporation of Keap1 cDNA was confirmed by
a 5-fold increase in Keap1 mRNA expression in Keap1+ cells

compared with control cells (Fig. 4A, Keap1). As a consequence of Nrf2 inhibition by Keap1-CBD overexpression,
the mRNA levels of NQO1, HO-1, MRP2, GCLC, and GCLM
were significantly reduced in Keap1+ cells compared with

control cells (Fig. 4A). Immunoblot analysis also showed a
reduction in the protein levels of Nrf2, NQO1, and γ-GCS
in Keap1+ cells under both basal and induced conditions
(Fig. 4B, compare lane 1 with lane 2 and lane 3 with lane
4). Consistent with a reduction of Nrf2 in Keap1 + cells,
NQO1 activity and glutathione levels were also lower in
Keap1+ cells than in control cells (Fig. 4C and D). Collectively,
these results show the successful establishment of a stable
cell line with reduced Nrf2 expression. Next, the sensitivities
of control and Keap1+ cells to cisplatin or paclitaxel were
compared. Keap1+ cells were significantly more sensitive to
cisplatin and paclitaxel than control cells (Fig. 4E), indicating
that Nrf2 protects cells against the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and paclitaxel.
Knockdown of Nrf2 increased the chemosensitivity of
SPEC-2 xenografts to cisplatin
To further confirm the role of Nrf2 in chemoresistance, a
human tumor xenograft model in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice was used. As shown in Fig. 5A and B,
the average tumor size developed after injection of control
cells or Keap1+ cells without cisplatin treatment was not
much different at the termination of the experiment. In con-

trast, the Keap1+ xenografts responded better to cisplatin
than the control xenografts as evidenced by the greater size
reduction of Keap1+ tumors than control tumors in the treated groups (Fig. 5A and B). Interestingly, the average tumor
weight in the Keap1+ group was less than that in the control
group, even in the untreated condition (Fig. 5C). It is worth
mentioning that Keap1+ tumors in the untreated group were
more cystic and some of them lost fluid during their removal
from the mice, resulting in an underestimation of tumor
weights in the untreated Keap1+ group. Furthermore, the difference in tumor size between the Keap1+/saline and Keap1+/
cisplatin groups is significantly larger than that between control/saline and control/cisplatin, with the smallest tumor
size observed in the Keap1+/cisplatin group (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these results indicate that genetic suppression of Nrf2
expression rendered xenografts more susceptible to cisplatin,
showing a critical role of Nrf2 in chemoresistance in vivo.
Keap1+ xenografts had an increase in apoptosis and a
decrease in proliferation
The excised tumors were used to confirm reduced expression of Nrf2 in Keap1+ tumors. Three tumors excised from
three different mice in each group were used for immunoblot

immunoblot analysis with an anti-CBD antibody (Fig. 6A,
Keap1-CBD). Consequently, the protein level of Nrf2 was
significantly lower in Keap1+ tumors compared with that in
control tumors in the untreated and treated groups (Fig. 6A,

treated groups (Fig. 5B). Next, cellular proliferation in tumor
tissues was assessed by IHC with an anti-Ki67 antibody. Cisplatin treatment significantly inhibited proliferation in both
control and Keap1+ tumors (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, there were
less proliferative cells in Keap1+ tumors compared with control tumors following cisplatin treatment (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, Keap1+ tumors showed a marked increase in the
number of apoptotic cells as detected by TUNEL analysis
(Fig. 6D). Taken together, these results clearly show that
suppression of Nrf2 expression results in a reduction in tumor
cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of tumor cells in
response to cisplatin treatment, which is likely the basis for
sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs when
Nrf2 is inhibited.

Discussion
Endometrial serous carcinoma is the most common gynecologic cancer in developed countries and is one of the lead-

ing causes of death in women. Despite the fact that many
new chemotherapeutic drugs have been developed and many
aggressive treatment options are available, the overall survival of patients has not been significantly improved because
many patients with type II endometrial cancer are either
refractory to chemotherapeutic treatments or develop resistance to chemotherapy (38, 39). Thus, resistance of cancer
cells to chemotherapeutic treatment represents a major
obstacle in cancer treatment.
In this study, we have investigated the possible contribution of Nrf2 in the poor prognosis of type II endometrial
cancer. Tissue sections from more than 100 patients with different types of endometrial lesions were obtained. The
expression of Nrf2 in these tissues was measured using IHC
staining. The results are striking: Nrf2 was not detected in
nonmalignant endometrial lesions and it was marginally expressed in type I endometrial tumors; however, a large percentage of type II endometrial tumors had a high level of Nrf2
(Table 2; Fig. 1). In addition, the functional ability of overexpressed Nrf2 was confirmed by elevated HO-1 expression in a
consecutive tissue section (Fig. 1). To our knowledge, this is
the first large-scale study of Nrf2 expression in human endometrial cancer. To further investigate the possible role of
Nrf2 in the resistance of type II endometrial cancer to therapeutic treatments, we used two cell lines derived from type I
and type II endometrial cancers: Ishikawa and SPEC-2, respectively. Our data clearly indicate that Nrf2 was overexpressed and transcription of its target genes was elevated

in SPEC-2 cells, which correlated with the resistance of
SPEC-2 to cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 2). In previous reports, high basal level of Nrf2 expression in certain
cancer tissues or cancer cell lines was attributed to somatic
mutations in Nrf2 or Keap1 that disrupt interaction, thus resulting in stabilization of Nrf2 (27–30). To our surprise, no
mutations were detected in the interaction domains of
Nrf2 or Keap1 in SPEC-2 (data not shown). However, a 30%
reduction in Keap1 mRNA expression and a 20% decrease in
the Keap1 protein level, compared with Ishikawa cells, were
detected. We believe that one of the molecular bases for Nrf2
overexpression in SPEC-2 is the reduced expression of Keap1,
which leads to the stabilization and higher expression of Nrf2
(Fig. 2A and B). Next, downregulation of Nrf2 by transient
transfection of Nrf2 siRNA or stable overexpression of Keap1
rendered SPEC-2 cells more susceptible to cisplatin and paclitaxel (Figs. 3 and 4). More importantly, the notion that
blockage of Nrf2 expression enhances tumor response to chemotherapeutic drugs is shown in vivo using SCID mice.
Keap1+ tumors in the cisplatin-treated group had the smallest tumor size and weight among all the groups (Fig. 5),
implicating Nrf2 as an important determinant of tumor response to chemotherapy. Obviously, coordinated upregulation of many Nrf2 target genes is responsible for protecting
cancer cells against anticancer drugs. However, the contribution of individual Nrf2 target genes in chemoresistance may

be different. Prompt recovery of glutathione levels by upregulating the Nrf2 target genes GCLC and GCLM following glutathione depletion may be important. In a recent report,
Hayes and colleagues showed that sulforaphane-mediated
protection against the cytotoxic effects of chlorambucil, not
menadione, was lost when cells were cotreated with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis (40).
Based on this finding, we speculate that inhibition of glutathione synthesis may have comparable effects as Nrf2 inhibition in sensitizing SPEC-2 to cisplatin treatment.
Interestingly, Keap1+ xenografts in the untreated group
had tumor sizes slightly smaller than control xenografts,
but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 5).
However, the average tumor weight in this group was significantly less than that in the control group (Fig. 5C). We
observed liquid discharge during isolation of the tumors
from this group. At this point, the watery nature of the
Keap1+ tumors is not clear. The proliferation and apoptosis
status measured by IHC-Ki67 and TUNEL did not show
any difference in the tumors between these two untreated
groups (Fig. 6C and D). This is consistent with the results
in Fig. 5D showing that inhibition of Nrf2 did not significantly affect cancer cell growth, but sensitized them to chemotherapeutic drugs. Interestingly, Biswal's group reported
that inhibition of Nrf2 in A549 cells by stable incorporation
of Nrf2-shRNA completely eliminated their growth in soft

agar and completely inhibited tumor formation in nude
mice without any treatment of chemotherapeutic drugs
(34). They also showed that suppression of Nrf2 expression
eliminated soft-agar growth of H460 cells, whereas tumors
developed in nude mice; however, the size was significantly
reduced (34). The reason underlying this discrepancy is not
clear.
In conclusion, we show that Nrf2 is overexpressed in human type II endometrial cancer compared with other types
of endometrial cancer, suggesting that Nrf2 may play a role in
the aggressiveness, resistance, and poor prognosis of type II
endometrial cancer. Studies using type I– and type II–derived
cell lines further confirmed the higher expression of Nrf2 in
type II endometrial cancer. Stable knockdown of Nrf2 by
Keap1 overexpression significantly sensitized both SPEC-2
cells and xenografts to chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting

that combined therapy with an Nrf2 inhibitor may represent
a new avenue in cancer treatment.
