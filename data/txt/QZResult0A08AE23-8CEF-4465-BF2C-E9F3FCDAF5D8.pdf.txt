BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have increased cancer risks. The authors reported nonlinear associations of cancer with triglyceride and other lipids in T2DM. Crosstalk between lipid metabolism and the
renin-angiotensin system may increase cancer risk via activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway in T2DM. In
this analysis, the authors explored associations of cancer risk with high/low triglyceride in T2DM and possible modifying effects of statins on this risk association, if any. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 5166 Chinese patients with
T2DM, free of cancer at enrollment and not using statins at or before enrollment, was analyzed using Cox models. Biological interactions were estimated using relative excess risk because of interaction, attributable proportion because
of interaction, and synergy index. Relative excess risk because of interaction >0, attributable proportion because of
interaction >0, or synergy index >1 indicates biological interaction. RESULTS: During 5.25 years of follow-up (median), 4.7% (n ¼ 243) patients developed cancer. Triglyceride <1.70 mmol/L was associated with increased cancer
risk in the entire cohort and in statin nonusers, but not in statin users. Patients with triglyceride <1.70 mmol/L plus
nonuse of statins during follow-up had 2.74-fold increased cancer risk compared with their counterparts with either
triglyceride 1.70 mmol/L or use of statins or both. There was significant interaction between triglyceride <1.70
mmol/L and nonuse of statins (relative excess risk because of interaction, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.071.90 and attributable proportion because of interaction, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.02-0.70). CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese T2DM

Diabetes is among the most prevalent diseases in the world, with a rapid increase in Asian populations in recent

years.1 In addition to cardiovascular disease, diabetes also predisposes to a variety of cancers.2 In Chinese patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the incidence of cancer was 1=3 higher than that in the general population.3 In a series of
investigations, our group reported the nonlinear risk associations of cancer with lipids exemplified by a V-shaped relationship for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol3,4 and an A-shaped
relationship with triglyceride with a zenith at 1.17 mmol/L.4 On the basis of these findings, we further observed that the
cancer risk association of low LDL cholesterol depended on the presence of albuminuria, which was attenuated by use of
statins.5 By using clinical and experimental studies, we reported crosstalk between lipid metabolism and the renin-

angiotensin system. This interaction may increase cancer
risk via activation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1,
Akt, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways in T2DM.6
Given the intimate relationships between cholesterol and
free fatty acid (triglyceride) metabolism, we used triglyceride 1.70 mmol/L, 1 of the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome, as a cutoff value7 and asked the
questions: 1) whether high and low triglyceride levels
increased risk of cancer as in the case of LDL cholesterol3;
and 2) if so, whether use of lipid-lowering drugs might
modify these risks.5

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The study used data of the Hong Kong Diabetes Registry,
which was established at the Prince of Wales Hospital, the
teaching hospital of the Chinese University of Hong
Kong. The hospital serves a population of >1.2 million.
The referral sources of the cohort included general practitioners, community clinics, other specialty clinics, the
Prince of Wales Hospital itself, and other hospitals. The
1998 World Health Organization criteria (the 1985 criteria were used before July 1998) were used to diagnose diabetes.8 Enrolled patients with hospital admissions within
6 to 8 weeks before assessment accounted for <10% of all
referrals. A 4-hour assessment of complications and risk
factors was performed on an outpatient basis, modified
from the European DiabCare protocol.9 Once a patient
had undergone this comprehensive assessment, he/she was
considered to have entered this study cohort and would be
followed until the time of death. Ethical approval was
obtained from the Chinese University of Hong Kong
Clinical Research Ethics Committee. The Declaration of
Helsinki was adhered to and written informed consent
was obtained from all patients, at the time of assessment,
for research purposes.
For this analysis, the clinical endpoints, including
discharge diagnoses and mortality from enrollment to
July 30, 2005 were recorded, or otherwise censored on
July 30, 2005. Details of all medical admissions of the
cohort by that date were retrieved from the Hong Kong
Hospital Authority Central Computer System, which
recorded admissions to all public hospitals in Hong Kong.
Collectively, these hospitals provide 95% of the total hospital bed-days in Hong Kong.10 Mortality data from the
Hong Kong Death Registry was also retrieved and crosschecked with hospital discharge status. Drug use data
were extracted from the Hospital Authority computer sys-

tem that recorded all drug dispensary data in public hospitals including the start dates and end dates for each of the
drugs of interest. In Hong Kong, all medications are dispensed onsite in both inpatient and outpatient settings.
These databases were matched by a unique identification
number, the Hong Kong Identity Card number, which is
compulsory for all residents in Hong Kong.
From 1996 to 2005, 7387 diabetic patients were enrolled in the registry. After sequential exclusion of 328
patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (defined as acute
presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis, heavy ketonuria
[>3þ], or continuous requirement of insulin within 1
year of diagnosis) or missing data on types of diabetes, 45
with non-Chinese or unknown nationality, 175 with a
known history of cancer or receiving cancer treatment at
enrollment, and 736 with missing values on any variables
used in the analysis (see Table 1 for a list of variables), a
total of 5166 patients were used in the analysis, after further exclusion of 937 patients who had ever used statins at
or before enrollment to remove potential prevalent user
bias (Fig. 1).
Clinical and Laboratory Measurements
Details of assessment methods and definitions have been
described.3 Patients attended the center after 8 hours of
fasting to undergo clinical assessments and laboratory
investigations. A sterile, random spot urinary sample was
used to measure albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR).
Microalbuminuria was defined as ACR 2.5 mg/mmol
in men and 3.5 mg/mmol in women. The abbreviated
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula
recalibrated for Chinese11 was used to estimate glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) expressed in mL/min/1.73 m2: estimated GFR ¼ 186  (SCR  0.011)1.154  (age)0.203
 (0.742 if female)  1.233, where SCR is serum creatinine expressed as lmol/L (original mg/dL converted to
lmol/L), and 1.233 is the adjusting coefficient for Chinese. Lipids (total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol) were measured by enzymatic methods on a
Hitachi (Hitachi Instrument Division, Ibaraki-ken, Japan) 911 automated analyzer, using reagent kits supplied
by the manufacturer of the analyzer. LDL cholesterol was
calculated using Friedewald’s equation.12 The precision
performance of these assays was within the manufacturer’s
specifications.

Statistical Analyses
The Statistical Analysis System (release 9.10) was used to
perform all statistical analysis (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Follow-up time was calculated as the period in years from
the first enrollment since December 1, 1996 to the date of

the first cancer event, death, or censoring, whichever came
first. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to
obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) of triglyceride <1.70 mmol/L versus 1.70 mmol/
L in the entire cohort and in statin users and nonusers,
separately. A structured adjustment scheme was used to
adjust for covariates. First, we adjusted for age, smoking
status, HbA1c, body mass index (BMI), LDL cholesterolrelated risk indictors (LDL cholesterol <2.80 mmol/L
plus albuminuria and LDL cholesterol 3.80 mmol/L),5
and HDL cholesterol. As BMI and HDL cholesterol were
associated with cancer in nonlinear manners, we used restricted cubic splines with 4 knots at the 5th, 35th, 65th,
and 95th percentiles of BMI and HDL cholesterol to
adjust for their confounding effects.4 Second, we adjusted
for covariates with P values <.10 (see Table 2 for the list
of covariates, including alcohol intake and duration of
diabetes).
To ascertain whether use of statins conferred clinical
benefits in patients with triglyceride <1.70 mmol/L, we
examined biological interaction between triglyceride
<1.70 mmol/L and nonuse of statins after enrollment, to
the earliest date of incident cancer, death, or 30 July 30,
2005, whichever came first.13,14 We used 3 measures to
estimate biological interaction: 1) relative excess risk
because of interaction; 2) attributable proportion because
of interaction; and 3) synergy index. The relative excess
risk because of interaction is the excess risk because of
interaction relative to the risk without exposure. Attributable proportion because of interaction refers to the attributable proportion of disease that is because of interaction
in persons with both exposures. Synergy index is the excess
risk from both exposures when there is a biological interaction, relative to the risk from both exposures without
interaction.15 Relative excess risk because of interaction

Cancer

>0, attributable proportion because of interaction >0, or
synergy index >1 indicates biological interaction. In Cox
models, relative excess risk because of interaction is the
best among the 3 measures.16 In addition, Kaplan-Meier
was used to examine the cumulative incidences of cancer
in patients stratified by triglyceride levels (ie, <1.70
mmol/L vs 1.70 mmol/L) and statin use status (ie, use
vs nonuse) (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for
Windows, Release 13.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).
The same 2-step adjustment scheme was used to
control for confounding effects of other covariates. In
addition, we calculated the propensity score (probability)
of initiation of statins during the follow-up period using a
stepwise logistic procedure (P ¼ .30).17 BMI, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, HbA1c, natural logarithm (ACR þ
1), duration of diabetes, retinopathy, prior myocardial infarction, and prior stroke were selected to calculate the
propensity score (c statistic ¼ 0.80). We then used stratified Cox models on deciles of the score to adjust for probability of initiation of statins during follow-up, which was
automatically exported from the SAS procedure of logistic
regression. Proportionality was checked using either the
Supremum test18 or plots of log negative log (survival distribution function) versus log (follow-up time), depending on whether the covariates were continuous or
categorical. Correlations between pairs of baseline covariates were checked using Pearson correlation test, and none
of the pairs was highly correlated (correlation coefficient,
<0.60).19 A 2-sided P value <.05 was considered to be
significant.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Patients
At the time of enrollment, the cohort had a median of 56
(25th to 75th percentiles, 46-67) years of age and 6 (25th
to 75th percentiles, 2-11) years of duration of disease.
During a median of 5.25 (25th to 75th percentiles, 3.027.19) years of follow-up, 4.7% (n ¼ 243) patients developed cancer, and the incidence of cancer was 9.34 (95%
CI, 8.18-10.51) per 1000 person-years. Compared with
those without cancer, patients who developed cancer were
older, more likely to be smokers or alcohol drinkers, had
longer duration of diabetes, higher blood pressure, and
lower triglyceride. They were more likely to have albuminuria and renal dysfunction, but less likely to use statins,
fibrates, gliclazide, metformin, and rosiglitazone (Table
1). Among statin nonusers, crude cancer rate was higher
in patients with triglyceride <1.70 mmol/L than in those

Associations Between Use of Statins and
Cancer
In univariate and multivariate Cox model analysis with
further adjustment for probability of use of statin during
the follow-up period, use of statins was associated with a
significantly lower risk of cancer among patients with triglyceride <1.70 mmol/L. To a less extent, use of statins
was also associated with lower cancer risk among patients
with triglyceride  1.70 mmol/L in univariable and multivariable Cox model analyses (Table 3).

Interaction of Low Triglyceride and Nonuse of
Statins on Cancer Risk
The Kaplan-Meier plot showed that statin nonusers with
triglyceride <1.70 mmol/L had the highest cumulative
incidence of cancer, followed by statin nonusers with triglyceride 1.70 mmol/L. Statin users, regardless of triglyceride levels, had the lowest cumulative incidence of
cancer during the 7-year follow-up period (Fig. 2). After
adjusting for covariates, patients with triglyceride <1.70
mmol/L plus nonuse of statins had 2.74-fold increased
cancer risk compared with their counterparts with either
triglyceride 1.70 mmol/L or use of statins or both. In
multivariate analysis, nonuse of statins alone and triglyceride <1.70 mmol/L alone were not associated with
increased cancer risks (Table 3), but there was a significant
biological interaction between triglyceride <1.70 mmol/

because of interaction were, respectively, 0.99 (95% CI,

Copresence of Low Triglyceride and Nonuse
of Statins for the Risk of Site-Specific
Cancers
Copresence of triglyceride <1.7 mmol/L and nonuse of
statins was associated with increased risk of cancers in digestive organs and peritoneum as well as cancers in sites
other than digestive organs and peritoneum. Other sitespecific cancers also showed a similar trend, albeit short of
significance with a small sample size (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
In this analysis, we have made novel discoveries regarding
the risk association of cancer with low triglyceride, defined
as <1.70 mmol/L (but not high triglyceride), and that
this risk association was attenuated in the presence of statin therapy.
The association between triglyceride and cancer
remains inconsistent in general populations and largely
unexplored in patients with T2DM despite their increased
cancer risks.2 Some studies reported positive associations
between triglyceride and certain cancers such as lung, rectal, thyroid,20 breast,21 and endometrial cancer.22 Con-

versely, other workers have reported negative associations
of triglyceride with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and prostate
cancer in men.20 Recent studies also failed to detect any
significant relationships between triglyceride and breast
cancer risk23,24 or cancer mortality.25
By using a prospective diabetes registry with detailed
documentation of risk factors, complications, clinical outcomes, and drug use, our group has systematically examined the risk relationships between T2DM and cancer in
Chinese populations. We first reported an A-shaped association between triglyceride levels and cancer, with a zenith at 1.17 mmol/L and a long right tail covering values
>2.5 mmol/L.4 In this analysis, we further confirmed that
copresence of low triglyceride, defined as <1.70 mmol/L,
and nonuse of statins was associated with increased risk of
cancer in T2DM. Although we detected increased risks of
all-site cancer in patients with low triglyceride plus nonuse
of statins, the small sample size prevented us from testing
associations for site-specific cancers. Notwithstanding the
consistent overall trend for site-specific cancers, we
acknowledged that other studies have reported a negative
association between diabetes and other site-specific cancers, such as lung cancer.26
Although the nature of these findings is not immediately obvious, they were in agreement with our previous

findings. In a series of investigations, we reported a Vshaped cancer risk association of LDL cholesterol, with a
nadir at 3.28 mmol/L. LDL cholesterol both 3.80
mmol/L and <2.8 mmol/L was associated with elevated
risks of cancers at any sites in T2DM patients naive to statins.3 Copresence of LDL cholesterol <2.80 mmol/L and
albuminuria dramatically increased the risk, which was
more than their summation. Similar to findings in the
present analysis, the increased cancer risk associated with
copresence of low LDL cholesterol and albuminuria was
attenuated in the presence of statin therapy.5 In a uninephrectomized rat model that developed glucose intolerance, renal impairment, and renal cancer 9 months after
the procedure, we observed up-regulation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, and IGF-1 and Akt
pathways. In animals treated with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, none developed renal cancer with normalization of the above pathways.6 In this context, during
cholesterol biosynthesis, intermediate nonsterol products
such as farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate,
and dolichyl phosphate are produced. These molecules
have been implicated in the post-translational modification and activity of many small proteins essential for cellular growth.27 On the basis of these prior knowledge and
our findings, we hypothesized that copresence of LDL
cholesterol and albuminuria might be associated with upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and intracellular
accumulation of nonsterol by-products to increase risk of
cancer in T2DM.5
Furthermore, lipid biosynthesis is tightly regulated
by 3 sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs)
with multiple feedback mechanisms.28 Among the 3

in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are shown. Insufficient insulin secretion or action may cause down-regulation of
SREBP-1c and its downstream signals, leading to a low triglyceride level, which may up-regulate the IGF-1, SREBP-1a
and cholesterol synthesis pathways. The up-regulation of
these pathways will then lead to increased production of intermediate molecules, which may lead to carcinogenesis.

Thus, using similar arguments and given the importance of insulin action in lipid storage, we postulate that
insufficient insulin secretion or its action may up-regulate
the IGF-1 and cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, which
can lead to intracellular accumulation of nonsterol products, which nonetheless can be inhibited by use of statins.
In support of this hypothesis, we recently reported a linear
association between HbA1c and cancer risk. Importantly,
use of insulin was independently associated with 80% risk
reduction in cancer risks in these patients with T2DM.31
Put another way, insulin treatment in insulin-insufficient
patients may restore synthesis of free fatty acid and prevent up-regulation of the IGF-1 and cholesterol synthesis
pathways, with attenuated cancer risk (See Fig. 3). Of
note, this hypothesis only explains in part the link
between T2DM and cancer in patients with insufficient
insulin action; that between cancer and hyperinsulinemia
requires further investigations.
Our study has several limitations. First, triglyceride
levels during follow-up were not systematically collected
and therefore not available for this analysis. The triglyceride status in some patients might also have changed during follow-up period. Second, the small number of fibrate
users does not allow us to perform a meaningful analysis
to examine interaction between low triglyceride and
fibrate use. Third, hospital admission and death registry
data were used to retrieve cancer events during the followup period, and a small number of cancer cases might have
been missed. Fourth, this was a mainly clinic-based
cohort, although major referral bias was unlikely, as evidenced by the low rates of complications at enrollment
and an annual mortality rate of 1% to 2%, comparable to
most Caucasian community-based cohorts or clinical trials.32 Fifth, this study was largely exploratory, and
requires independent replication.
In conclusion, in a prospective cohort of Chinese
patients with T2DM with detailed documentation of
drug use during the follow-up period, low triglyceride
level was associated with increased cancer risk, which was
attenuated in the presence of statin therapy. Our findings
emphasize the critical importance of maintaining energy
balance and internal milieu as reflected by the narrow
range of biomarkers including lipid values, such as LDL
cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.3,4 Taking all data into
consideration, we hypothesize that in T2DM, insufficient
intracellular lipid synthesis because of lack of insulin
action may cause up-regulation of other pathways, resulting in production of intermediate carcinogenic molecules,
which nonetheless can be inhibited by statin therapy.

870

Given the high risk of T2DM patients for cancer, our
findings suggest that statins may have beneficial effects
beyond cardiovascular protection, and that lipid values
may help identify high-risk subjects for further
intervention.
