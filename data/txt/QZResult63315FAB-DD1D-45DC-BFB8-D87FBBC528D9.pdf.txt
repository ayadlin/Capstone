ABSTRACT
The PKCβ inhibitor enzastaurin was tested in parental neuroblastoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, their vincristine-resistant sub-lines, primary
neuroblastoma cells, ABCB1-transduced, ABCG2-transduced, and p53-depleted
cells. Enzastaurin IC50s ranged from 3.3 to 9.5 μM in cell lines and primary cells
independently of the ABCB1, ABCG2, or p53 status. Enzastaurin 0.3125 μM interfered
with ABCB1-mediated drug transport. PKCα and PKCβ may phosphorylate and
activate ABCB1 under the control of p53. However, enzastaurin exerted similar
effects on ABCB1 in the presence or absence of functional p53. Also, enzastaurin
inhibited PKC signalling only in concentrations ≥ 1.25 μM. The investigated cell
lines did not express PKCβ. PKCα depletion reduced PKC signalling but did not affect
ABCB1 activity. Intracellular levels of the fluorescent ABCB1 substrate rhodamine
123 rapidly decreased after wash-out of extracellular enzastaurin, and enzastaurin
induced ABCB1 ATPase activity resembling the ABCB1 substrate verapamil.
Computational docking experiments detected a direct interaction of enzastaurin
and ABCB1. These data suggest that enzastaurin directly interferes with ABCB1
function. Enzastaurin further inhibited ABCG2-mediated drug transport but by a
different mechanism since it reduced ABCG2 ATPase activity. These findings are
important for the further development of therapies combining enzastaurin with ABC
transporter substrates.

been investigated for its effects against various cancer
types in clinical trials [4, 13–22].
We had previously shown that enzastaurin
activates glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β in natural
killer cells and in turn reduces their activity [23]. To
test the effects of (potential) anti-cancer agents in the
context of cellular chemoresistance mechanisms, we
have established the Resistant Cancer Cell Line (RCCL)
collection, a collection of cell lines from 15 different
cancer entities with acquired resistance to various

INTRODUCTION
Enzastaurin (also known as LY317615) was
synthesised as protein kinase C (PKC) β inhibitor based
on the structure of staurosporine, a natural compound
known to interfere with PKC signalling [1]. In pre-clinical
models, enzastaurin displayed activity against cancer cells
from different entities including carcinomas, glioblastoma,
melanoma, and different haematological malignancies as
well as anti-angiogenic effects [2–13]. The substance has

cytotoxic and targeted anti-cancer drugs (http://www.
kent.ac.uk/stms/cmp/RCCL/RCCLabout.html) including
cell lines derived from the paediatric cancer entities
neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Significant
subgroups of patients suffering from these cancers are
high-risk patients with very poor prognosis [24–27].
Vincristine is a constituent of therapy regimens for
both neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma [24–28].
Here, we tested enzastaurin alone or in combination
with vincristine in a panel of parental neuroblastoma
and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and their vincristineresistant sub-lines.

ABCB1 recognises a broad range of structurally
different substrates. In concordance, enzastaurin 0.625
μM and 1.25 μM also dose-dependently sensitised
ABCB1-expressing UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells (that do not
express ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC5, or ABCG2,
data not shown) to the alternative cytotoxic ABCB1
substrates paclitaxel and actinomycin D (Figure 1C,
Suppl. Table 2). Enzastaurin further sensitised ABCB1expressing UKF-NB-3rVCR10, UKF-NB-2rVCR10,
KFRrVCR10, and Rh30rVCR10 cells (but not nonABCB1-expressing UKF-NB-3, UKF-NB-2, KFR, and
Rh30 cells) to vincristine in a dose-dependent manner.
Enzastaurin concentrations as low as 0.3125 μM were
found to enhance vincristine activity (Figure 1D, Suppl.
Table 3A–3D).
Finally, we investigated the influence of enzastaurin
on the efflux of the fluorescent ABCB1 substrate
rhodamine 123 in ABCB1-expressing UKF-NB-3rVCR10
cells. Enzastaurin caused a concentration-dependent
increase in rhodamine 123 fluorescence in the UKFNB-3rVCR10 cells (Figure 1E) but did not affect ABCB1
expression (data not shown).

RESULTS
Influence of enzastaurin on viability of
neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cells
Enzastaurin interfered with the viability of
chemosensitive and chemoresistant neuroblastoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma cells in similar concentrations,
enzastaurin IC50 values ranged from 3.74 to 8.20 μM
(Table 1). Similar results were obtained in primary
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells (Table 2).
ABCB1 and ABCG2 are major ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters that are involved in the
passage of drugs, xenobiotics, and food constituents
through cellular and tissue barriers and consequently in
their absorption, distribution, and excretion. Moreover,
ABCB1 and ABCG2 are frequently found highly
expressed on cancer cells playing an important role in
cancer cell chemoresistance [29–31]. p53 is a major
tumour suppressor gene. Loss-of-p53 function has been
associated with decreased drug sensitivity in cancers
including neuroblastoma [32, 33]. However, neither p53
functionality nor ABCB1 or ABCG2 expression status
significantly modified enzastaurin sensitivity of the
investigated cell lines (Table 1).

Direct interaction of enzastaurin with ABCB1
Previous reports had indicated that PKCα or PKCβ
may promote ABCB1 function by phosphorylation [34,
35]. Therefore, enzastaurin may affect ABCB1 function
through direct interaction with ABCB1 and/or inhibition
of PKC-mediated ABCB1 phosphorylation. Enzastaurin
affected ABCB1 function in concentrations as low as
0.3125 μM (Figure 1D, Figure 1E, Suppl. Table 3).
Since enzastaurin was shown to inhibit PKCβ enzyme
activity with an IC50 of 0.03 μM and PKCα activity
with an IC50 of 0.8 μM in isolated enzyme assays [1],
enzastaurin-mediated effects on PKCα signalling are
unlikely to be responsible for the reduced ABCB1 activity.
Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS)
is a PKC substrate, and MARCKS phosphorylation is a
surrogate parameter for PKC activity [3, 4]. Enzastaurin
inhibited MARCKS phosphorylation in UKF-NB-3rVCR10
cells only in concentrations of 1.25 μM or higher after
6 h of incubation. After 120 h, only an enzastaurin
concentration of 5 μM reduced MARKS phosphorylation
(Figure 2A). Since enzastaurin inhibits ABCB1 function
in concentrations as low as 0.3125 μM (Figure 1D, Suppl.
Table 3), this finding suggests that the enzastaurinmediated inhibition of ABCB1 function may not be the
consequence of inhibition of PKC-mediated ABCB1
phosphorylation.
Next, we wanted to test whether interference with
PKC signalling is sufficient to interfere with ABCB1
function in our model. Although we readily detected
PKCβ in K562 cells that had served as positive control, we
were not able to detect PKCβ in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells

Enzastaurin sensitises ABCB1-expressing cells to
cytotoxic ABCB1 substrates
Next, the influence of enzastaurin was tested
on the vincristine sensitivity of neuroblastoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Enzastaurin 1.25 μM, a
concentration that did not significantly affect cell line
viability, sensitised ABCB1-expressing vincristineresistant cells to the ABCB1 substrate vincristine but
did not substantially change the vincristine sensitivity
of the respective parental cell lines that express low
levels of ABCB1 (Figure 1A, Suppl. Table 1). Effects
were similar in vincristine-adapted, ABCB1-expressing
cells and in UKF-NB-3ABCB1 cells transduced with
a lentiviral vector encoding for ABCB1 (Figure 1B,
Suppl. Table 1).

(Suppl. Figure 1A). PKCα was present, and siRNAmediated PKCα depletion inhibited PKC signalling as
indicated by decreased levels of phosphorylated MARCKS
(Figure 2B, Suppl. Figure 1B). However, siRNA-mediated
depletion of PKCα did (in contrast to ABCB1 depletion)
not increase rhodamine 123 accumulation in or vincristine
sensitivity of ABCB1-expressing UKF-NB-3rVCR10
cells (Figure 2C, Suppl. Figure 1C). Similar results were
obtained in UKF-NB-3ABCB1 cells (Suppl. Figure 2A–2C).
After incubation of UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells
with rhodamine 123 and enzastaurin, the wash-out of

extracellular enzastaurin (and rhodamin 123) resulted in a
rapid decrease of cellular rhodamine 123 fluorescence in
a similar fashion like the wash out of the known ABCB1
substrate verapamil (Figure 3A). In addition, enzastaurin
0.3125 μM significantly increased ABCB1 ATPase
activity (Figure 3B). The combination of enzastaurin
and verapamil further enhanced ABCB1 ATPase activity
(Figure 3C). Taken together, these data suggest that
enzastaurin interferes with ABCB1 predominantly through
direct interaction with ABCB1, possibly being an ABCB1
substrate.

interaction between enzastaurin and ABCB1. The docking
scores for the top five docking poses ranged between
−16.60 and −9.01 kcal/mol for mouse, and between
−13.30 and −10.42 kcal/mol for human ABCB1 (Suppl.
Table 4). Docking enzastaurin into 3G60 and 3G61
generated the lowest binding scores. The protein structures
3G61 and 3G60 are the structures co-crystallised with
QZ59-SSS and QZ59-RRR respectively, and have
a x-ray resolutions of 4.35 Å and 4.40 Å. 3G5U is the
apo-structure with a higher x-ray resolution of 3.80 Å.
Suppl. Table 4 also shows that the best binding scores in all
cases are achieved when the biding site is defined using the
co-crystallised QZ59-SSS (see the average of the top five
poses in Suppl. Table 4). The only exception to this is the
top pose obtained for 3G60 when docked into QZ59-RRR
binding site. The energy of the top pose can be as low as
−16.60 when the binding site residues of QZ59-RRR have
been selected to define the binding pocket for enzastaurin
(Suppl. Table 4).
Suppl. Table 5 shows the ligand interaction report
indicating specific interactions between structural elements
of the enzastaurin structure and ABCB1 residues in the
top docking poses. A summary of the residues involved in
the enzastaurin interaction with mouse Abcb1a has been
plotted in Figure 4A. The figure indicates that the most
prevalent interacting residues in mouse Abcb1a are Phe71,
Phe728, and Phe974. Notably, Phe728 and Phe974 are the
amino acids reported by Aller et al. [36] to be involved
in the QZ59-RRR binding site. These three Phe residues
are mostly involved in π-π interactions, with fewer
occurrences of π-H or π-cation interactions with the ligand
(Suppl. Table 5). An example of a top scoring docking
pose for the interaction of enzastaurin with mouse Abcb1a
is shown in Figure 4B. The Phe residues 71, 728 and 974
are present in the binding site with the shadows indicating
that in the absence of the ligand these amino acids are
highly exposed to the solvent, but the presence of the
ligand greatly reduces the solvent accessible surface area
(Figure 4B). In addition, there are several other lipophilic
residues in the close proximity of the ligand with receptor
exposure shadows indicating the possibility of several
hydrophobic interaction points (Figure 4B). The pyridine
ring in the ligand has a strong arene-H interaction with
Gln721, while the pyrrole ring is engaged in H-bonding
interaction with Ser975 (Figure 4).

as determined by flow cytometry (Figure 5B; Suppl.
Figure 3). While enzastaurin had enhanced ABCB1
ATPase activity, it inhibited basal and sulfasalazineinduced ABCG2 activity (Figure 6A and 6B) indicating
that enzastaurin inhibits ABCB1 and ABCG2 activity
through different mechanisms.

DISCUSSION
PKC signalling was reported to be relevant in
neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma [37–40]. In
this report, IC50 values between 3.7 and 8.2 μM were
determined for the PKCβ inhibitor enzastaurin in a panel
of parental neuroblastoma and rhabdhomyosarcoma cell
lines and their vincristine-resistant sub-lines and IC50s
between 3.3 and 9.5 μM in primary neuroblastoma cells.
These concentrations are in the range of those reported
to be effective in other cancer entities [2, 6]. Notably,
enzastaurin activity was not affected by ABC transporters
ABCB1 or ABCG2 or the cellular p53 status. With
regard to p53, our results are in line with a recent study
that showed that the effects of enzastaurin monotherapy
did not differ between HCT116p53wt and HCTp53−/− cells
[41]. However, since enzastaurin plasma levels of 1 − 2
μM were reported to be achievable in patients [14, 42],
enzastaurin may rather not be a candidate for single
therapy in neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma.
Enzastaurin concentrations as low as 0.3125
μM sensitised ABCB1-expressing cells (but not nonABCB1-expressing cells) to toxicity induced by the
ABCB1 substrate vincristine. Enzastaurin also sensi­
tised ABCB1-expressing cells to the structurally differing
cytotoxic ABCB1 substrates paclitaxel and actinomycin
D. Notably, enzastaurin exerted more pronounced effects
on vincristine- and paclitaxel-mediated toxicity than on
actinomycin D-induced toxicity. The exact molecular
mechanisms underlying these differences are not clear.
It is known that the mode and/or strength of ABCB1
interaction may differ among ABCB1 substrates and
ABCB1 modulators. Certain ABCB1 modulators
were shown to exert differing effects on the cellular
accumulation of distinct ABCB1 substrates [43–45].
Moreover, enzastaurin caused a dose-dependent
accumulation of the fluorescent ABCB1 substrate
rhodamine 123 in ABCB1-expressing cells. Again,
significant effects were determined at an enzastaurin
concentration of 0.3125 μM. These data indicate that
enzastaurin interferes with ABCB1-mediated drug
transport. This is of potential clinical relevance. ABCB1
is expressed at virtually every tissue and organ barrier
and influences the absorption, distribution, and excretion
of drugs, xenobiotics, and food constituents [29, 31].
Therefore, enzastaurin may affect the pharmacokinetics
of co-administered drugs including anti-cancer drugs
and drugs non-related to cancer. Moreover, ABCB1 is
frequently found highly expressed on cancer cells playing

Effects of enzastaurin on ABCG2
Finally, we showed that enzastaurin also
concentration-dependently sensitised ABCG2-transduced
UKF-NB-3 (UKF-NB-3ABCG2) cells (but not UKF-NB-3 or
control vector-transduced UKF-NB-3iG2 cells) to toxicity
induced by the cytotoxic ABCG2 substrate mitox­
antrone (Figure 5A, Suppl. Table 6A–6C). In addition,
enzastaurin enhanced mitoxantrone accumulation in
UKF-NB-3ABCG2 cells but not in UKF-NB-3iG2 cells

an important role in cancer cell drug resistance [30].
Seemingly, our data are in accordance with unpublished
internal data from Eli Lilly [46].
Previous reports had shown that PKCα and PKCβ
may promote ABCB1 function by phosphorylation [34,
35]. However, other data did not support this [47, 48], and
further reports even suggested that PKC signalling may also
decrease ABCB1 activity [49, 50]. Our data do not suggest
that PKCα and/or PKCβ inhibition may play a dominant role
in the observed effects on ABCB1 function in our system
although some contribution of effects on PKC signalling
cannot be excluded, in particular at higher enzastaurin
concentrations. We did not observe PKCβ expression
in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells. PKCα depletion reduced
MARCKS phosphorylation indicating inhibition of PKC
signalling but did not affect ABCB1 function. Moreover,
the enzastaurin IC50 for PKCα inhibition in isolated enzyme
assay is 0.8 μM (1) and appears, thus, to be too high to
explain effects on ABCB1 function in concentrations as low
as 0.3125 μM. Also, enzastaurin-mediated inhibition of PKC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

signalling became only detectable at a concentration of 1.25
μM after 6 h of incubation or 5 μM after 120 h of incubation.
These concentrations are substantially higher than the low
enzastaurin concentrations that affected ABCB1-mediated
drug transport. In addition, wash-out experiments and
determination of ABCB1 ATPase activity demonstrated
that the enzastaurin-mediated effects closely resemble those
of the ABCB1 substrate verapamil. Therefore, enzastaurin
appears to interfere directly with ABCB1, possibly being
an ABCB1 substrate. This finding is in concordance with
data showing that staurosporine, the lead structure that
provided the basis for the synthesis of enzastaurin [1], and
staurosporine analogues may interfere with ABCB1 function
independently of effects on PKC signalling [43].
In a head-to-head comparison of enzastaurin with
staurosporine and its derivatives UCN-01, GF109203X,
and RO-31–8220 that had previously been investigated
for their interaction with ABCB1-mediated drug transport
[43], enzastaurin exerted similar effects on rhodamine 123
accumulation in ABCB1-transduced UKF-NB-3ABCB1 cells

like staurosporine and UCN-01 that had previously been
shown to interfere strongly with ABCB1-mediated drug
transport [43]. Also in concert with previous findings [43],
GF109203X and RO-31–8220 displayed substantially
weaker or no effects on rhodamin 123 accumulation
(Suppl. Figure 4A and 4B). Moreover, enzastaurin exerted
stronger effects on rhodamin 123 accumulation than ver­
apamil in a direct comparison (Suppl. Figure 4A and 4B).
The notion that enzastaurin interacts directly with
ABCB1 is further supported by computational docking
studies. Recent analyses had shown that docking studies
performed by various approaches are reliable strategies
to identify compounds that interact directly with ABCB1
[51–53]. From our previous studies, the docking scores
obtained for a group of 54 substrates (including well-known
substrates such as ivermectin and cyclosporine) had an
average docking score of ≤ −12, like those we observed for
enzastaurin in the 3G60 structure, while a group of 69 nonwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

substrates had an average score of ~ −10 kcal/mol using
MOE software and the same docking methodology [54, 55].
Notably, the effects of PKC signalling on ABCB1
phosphorylation and function appear to be cell typedependent. In ovarian carcinoma cells, antisense oligomers
directed against PKCα and PKCβ reversed ABCB1mediated drug resistance [56]. In contrast, PKCβ was not
detectable in our model system, and siRNAs targeting
PKCα interfered with PKC signalling but not with
ABCB1 function. Moreover, p53 was shown to suppress
PKCα-mediated ABCB1 activation in leiomyosarcoma,
fibrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma cells [35]. In contrast, the
enzastaurin-mediated effects on ABCB1 function did not
differ between p53 wild-type and p53-mutant neuroblastoma
or rhabdomyosarcoma cells in the present study.
In addition to its interaction with ABCB1,
enzastaurin interfered with ABCG2-mediated drug
transport but the mode of action appears to be different.

While enzastaurin stimulated ABCB1 ATPase activity, it
inhibited ABCG2 ATPase activity. ABCC1 (also known
as MRP1) is another ABC transporter that is known to be
of clinical relevance in neuroblastoma [57]. Noteworthy,
enzastaurin also sensitised ABCC1-expressing cells to the
ABCC1 substrate vincristine and enhanced accumulation
of the fluorescent ABCC1 substrate 5-CFDA in ABCC1expressing cells (Suppl. Figure 5A–5C). Our findings
showing that enzastaurin interferes with ABCB1-,
ABCG2-, and ABCC1-mediated drug transport are of
relevance for the further development of enzastaurin
combination therapies. Enzastaurin has been reported to
display enhanced activity  in combination with various
anti-cancer drugs [see  e.g. 11, 13, 17, 19, 41; 58–60]
including ABCB1, ABCG2, and/or ABCC1 substrates
such as paclitaxel [60], docetaxel [58], erlotinib [59],
and doxorubicin [11]. In the light of the finding that
enzastaurin interferes with the ABCB1-, ABCG2-, and
ABCC1-mediated drug transport studies that investigate
the combined use of enzastaurin with substrates of these
transporters may require careful (re-)evaluation.
In conclusion, our data show that enzastaurin
inhibits ABCB1 predominantly through direct interaction
independently of effects on PKC signalling or the cellular
p53 status. This finding is in particular relevant for the
further development of therapies in which enzastaurin is
combined with ABCB1 substrates.

3p53shRNA) were established by lentiviral transfection as
described previously [65–68] (http://www.lentigo-vectors.
de). ABCB1 expression data for the project cell lines is
presented in Suppl. Figure 6.
Fresh neuroblastoma cells (MYCN amplified) were
isolated from the bone marrow aspirate of patients with
metastasised INSS stage 4 neuroblastoma.
Cells were propagated in IMDM supplemented with
10% foetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 mg/
ml streptomycin at 37°C.

Viability assay
Cell viability was tested by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye
reduction assay after 120 h incubation modified as described
before [64].

ABC transporter expression and function
Antibodies directed against ABCB1 (Alexis
Biochemicals via AXXORA Deutschland, Lörrach,
Germany) or ABCG2 (Kamiya Biomedical Company,
Seattle, WA, USA), followed by a secondary antibody
labelled with Phycoerythrin (R&D, Wiesbaden, Germany)
were used to detect protein expression by flow cytometry
(FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany).
To investigate ABCB1-mediated drug efflux, cells
were pre-incubated with different concentrations of
enzastaurin for 30 min. 0.5 μM rhodamine 123 (fluorescent
ABCB1 substrate) was added for another 30 min. Then,
cell culture medium was removed, cells were washed three
times with PBS, and fresh medium containing enzastaurin
was added. After another 45 min, cellular fluorescence was
analysed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur). Rhodamine
123 was detected at the FL1 channel.
For wash out kinetic experiments, cells were
incubated for 1 h with 0.5 μM rhodamine 123 and
enzastaurin at the indicated concentrations. Cells were
resuspended in supplemented medium and cellular
fluorescence was measured after different time points (t0, t5,
t15, t30, t60, t120 minutes) by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur).
To investigate ABCG2-mediated drug efflux, the
same procedures were carried out. Mitoxantrone served as
fluorescent and cytotoxic ABCG2 substrate. The ABCG2
inhibitor Ko143 [69] was used as control substance.
The ATPase activities of ABCB1 and ABCG2
were determined using membrane preparations (ABCB1Membran: BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany; ABCG2
membrane: Solvo Biotechnolgy, Budapest, Hungary) and
an established kit (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany)
following the manufacturer’s instruction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs
Enzastaurin was purchased from Selleck Chemicals
via BIOZOL GmbH (Eching, Germany). Vincristine was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Munich,
Germany). Rhodamine 123 was purchased from Merck
Biosciences (Darmstadt, Germany).

Cell culture
The MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines UKFNB-2 and UKF-NB-3 were established from INSS stage 4
neuroblastoma patients [61, 62]. The rhabdomyosarcoma
cell line Rh30 was kindly provided by Dr. P.J. Houghton
(St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis,
TN). The alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line KFR was
established from a bone marrow metastasis [63]. K562
cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA).
The cell lines were adapted to growth in the presence
of vincristine 10 ng/ml and named UKF-NB-2rVCR10 [61],
UKF-NB-3rVCR10 [62], Rh30rVCR10 [64], KFRrVCR10
and derived from the RCCL collection (http://www.kent.

by proximity to a co-crystallised ligand and the residues
reported by Aller et al. [36] to be involved in the binding
pocket of cyclic-tris-(R)-valineselenazole (QZ59-RRR),
upper binding pocket of cyclic-tris-(S)-valineselenazole
(QZ59-SSS), lower binding pocket of QZ59-SSS, or the
verapamil binding site (residues protected from MTS
labelling by verapamil) as described by Aller et al [36].
In the MOE dock panel, the placement method was
Triangle Matcher, scoring methodology was set to London
dG as the first and the second scoring functions, and the
final energy was evaluated using the Generalized Born
solvation model (GB/VI) and finally, the top five best
scoring poses were retained.
Default parameters of the software were used for
the calculation of the ligand interactions. These were
energy cut-off for H-bonding and ionic interactions at
−0.5 kcal/mol and the maximum distance for non-bonded
interactions at 4.5 Å. This docking methodology has
been validated previously by docking the co-crystallised
ligand, QZ59-RRR and comparing the geometries of
the ‘docked ABCB1/QZ59-RRR’ structure with the
structure of P-gp/QZ59-RRR complexes from x-ray
crystallography [71]. The docking methodology using
MOE has a built in conformational search that conducts
a systematic search covering all combinations of angles
on a grid if this will result in under 5000 conformers.
Otherwise a stochastic sampling of conformations is
conducted. In addition to this automatic conformational
search in one of the docking experiments for each protein,
we performed a prior conformational analysis before the
docking and used all the resulting conformations. MOE
conformational search was used with LowModeMD
sampling method. This sampling method has been
suggested as the method of choice for larger flexible
compounds and macrocycles [70]. Using the default
settings of the software, 74 different conformations were
generated and used in one docking experiment for each
of the proteins.

Western blot
Cells were lysed in Triton X-sample buffer and
separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected using
specific antibodies directed against β-actin (BioVision
via BioCat GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), PKCα (abcam,
Cambridge, UK), PKCβ (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany), MARCKS (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA), and phosphorylated MARCKS (Cell
Signaling Technology). Protein bands were visualised
by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercially
available kit (Amersham, Freiburg, Germany).

siRNA transfection experiments
Synthetic siRNA oligonucletides targeting ABCB1
or PRKCA (encoding for PKCα) (ON-TARGET
plusSMART pool siRNAs) were purchased from
Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). The non targeting
siRNA ON-TARGET plus SMART pool (Dharmacon) was
used as negative control. Transfections were performed
using the NeonTM Transfection System (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. UKF-NB-3rVCR10 or UKF-NB-3ABCB1 cells were
grown to about 60–80% confluence, trypsinised and 2 ×
106 cells were re-suspended in 200 μl re-suspension buffer
containing 2.5 μM siRNA. Electroporation was performed
in a pipette tip chamber with previously optimised
adjustments (voltage 1400, width 20ms, 2 pulses). After
electroporation, the cells were transferred into fibronectin
(100 μg/ml)-coated 6-well-plates containing pre-warmed
IMDM plus 10% foetal calf serum.

ABCB1 docking studies
The protein and ligands were prepared for docking
in MOE (version 2012.10, Chemical Computing Group
Inc., Montreal, Canada). Mouse Abcb1a structures,
3G60, 3G61 and 3G5U [36] were obtained from the
protein data bank (http://www.rcsb.org), the human
homology model based on this structure from [70]. The
crystal parameters were retained and all atoms of ABCB1
were protonated and titrated using default parameters of
the software.
To prepare the ligand for docking, atomic charges
were initially calculated using Merck Molecular Force
Field 94 (MMFF94) force field and then the energy
was minimised and atomic charges were re-calculated
using Self-Consistent Field (SCF) optimization (AM1
Hamiltonian). Several docking experiments were
performed for each protein using the binding site defined

Statistics
Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. of at least
three experiments. Comparisons between two groups were
performed using Student’s t-test. Three and more groups
were compared by ANOVA followed by the StudentNewman-Keuls test. P values lower than 0.05 were
considered to be significant.
