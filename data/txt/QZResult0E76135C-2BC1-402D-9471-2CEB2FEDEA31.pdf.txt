Abstract
To identify potential mechanisms underlying prostate cancer chemotherapy response and resistance, we
compared the gene expression profiles in high-risk human prostate cancer specimens before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical prostatectomy. Among the molecular signatures associated with chemotherapy, transcripts encoding inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) were significantly upregulated. The patient
biochemical relapse status was monitored in a long-term follow-up. Patients with ID1 upregulation were found
to be associated with longer relapse-free survival than patients without ID1 increase. This in vivo clinical association was mechanistically investigated. The chemotherapy-induced ID1 upregulation was recapitulated in
the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Docetaxel dose-dependently induced ID1 transcription, which was mediated by ID1 promoter E-box chromatin modification and c-Myc binding. Stable ID1 overexpression in LNCaP
increased cell proliferation, promoted G1 cell cycle progression, and enhanced docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity.
These changes were accompanied by a decrease in cellular mitochondria content, an increase in BCL2
phosphorylation at serine 70, caspase-3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In contrast,
ID1 siRNA in the LNCaP and C42B cell lines reduced cell proliferation and decreased docetaxel-induced
cytotoxicity by inhibiting cell death. ID1-mediated chemosensitivity enhancement was in part due to ID1 suppression of p21. Overexpression of p21 in LNCaP-ID1–overexpressing cells restored the p21 level and reversed
ID1-enhanced chemosensitivity. These molecular data provide a mechanistic rationale for the observed in vivo
clinical association between ID1 upregulation and relapse-free survival. Taken together, it shows that ID1
expression has a novel therapeutic role in prostate cancer chemotherapy and prognosis. Cancer Res; 70(8);

Introduction
In the treatment of advanced, castration-resistant prostate
cancer, docetaxel-based chemotherapy is empirically deployed as no markers are available to select patients who
do and do not benefit from treatment (1–3). When used preoperatively in the treatment of high-risk and localized disease, docetaxel-based chemotherapy can reduce serum
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), but has not resulted in complete pathologic responses; the long-term benefit is a subject
of ongoing randomized clinical trials (4–6). These results

emphasize the importance of understanding the molecular
mechanisms underlying the prostate cancer chemotherapy
response and resistance.
Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) is a negative regulator of
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (7). It has been
implicated in regulating a variety of cellular processes, including growth, senescence, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and neoplastic transformation (8). In various
mammalian cell culture models, cellular differentiation is associated with the downregulation of ID1, whereas ID1 overexpression inhibits the ability to differentiate (9). The
inhibition of differentiation can also be accompanied by cell
proliferation (10). Several lines of evidence have suggested
that ID1 transcriptionally inhibits the expression of cyclindependent kinase inhibitors p16, p21, and p27 (11–13). Cells
that overexpress ID1 progress through the G1-S cell cycle
transition much faster than those that do not (7, 14). ID1
has been shown to promote apoptosis in a variety of settings
(7). Transgenic mice engineered to overexpress ID1 in T cells
show massive apoptosis in thymocytes (15). ID1 overexpression has also been reported to induce apoptosis in dense
mammary epithelial cells and cardiac myocytes through a
redox mechanism (16, 17).

The role of ID1 in cancer development has also been intensely investigated. ID1 knockout mice exhibit an impaired
angiogenic response to tumor xenografts due to reduced endothelial cell differentiation, mobilization, and recruitment
(18), but are also more susceptible to tumor formation in a
chemically induced skin carcinogenesis model (19). In human
breast cancer, overexpression of ID1 is associated with lung
metastasis (20, 21). In prostate cancer cell lines, ID1 is linked
with increased androgen independence (22), oncogenic signaling (23, 24), and resistance to cytotoxic therapy (25–28).
Although ID1 protein overexpression was initially reported
in many tumor types, more recent recognition of the nonspecific nature of the antibodies used have brought into question
the validity of these observations, including those made in
clinical samples of prostate cancer (29). Recently, we observed
that ID1 mRNA transcripts were significantly downregulated
in patient-matched human prostate cancer epithelium compared with its adjacent benign epithelium derived from lasercapture microdissection (LCM) of frozen needle biopsy
samples (30). Overall, the role of ID1 has been well defined
in the endothelial compartment and tumor angiogenesis,
but not in epithelial cancer cells. The impact of cancer therapies on ID1 expression is not well understood.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The human prostate cell line LNCaP and human
embryonic kidney cell line 293T/17 (HEK293T/17) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Prostate
cancer C42B cell line was a gift from Dr. John Isaacs (Johns
Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Cells were cultured as previously described (31).
Plasmid construction and transfection. Lentiviral-ID1–
expressing plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Rhoda Alani
(Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). Lentivirus vector
iDuet 101 and packing plasmids pCMV-Δ8.92 and pMD.G were
kind gifts of Dr. Linzhao Cheng (Johns Hopkins University School
of Medicine). Full-length p21 was amplified by PCR from cDNA
of LNCaP cell line and inserted to a lentiviral vector iDuet 101.
ID1 siRNA. An oligo-based ID1 siRNA cocktail (SMARTpool siRNA) and transfection reagent Dharmafect 3 were
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Dharmacon. The
transfection reaction was based on the manufacturer's protocol as previously described (32).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. LNCaP cells were treated with either solvent or 10 nmol/L docetaxel for 24 hours.
The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was done
as previously described (33) using antibodies specific for
c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), acetyl-histone 3 lysine 9
(Ace-H3K9; Millipore Inc), or isotype rabbit IgG control.
DNA recovered from ChIP or input controls were subject
to real-time quantitative PCR using primers flanking the
E-box in ID1 promoter region (forward 5′-TGGAAGATTGCACTGTGGGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-CACTGTTCTCGTCCAGAGTGTTCT-3′). Promoter occupancy was calculated
based on the ratio of ChIP to input control.
Cell proliferation and viability. As previously described
(34), cancer cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 per well

3240

Cancer Res; 70(8) April 15, 2010

in 24- or 12-well culture plates. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the attached cells were treated. Viable cells at specific
time points were counted by a hemocytometer based on
the trypan blue exclusion principle.
Florescence-assisted cell sorting cell cycle analysis. Flow
cytometry analysis was carried out in BD FACSCalibur analyzer as previously described (31). Results were analyzed by
software for cells at sub-G1 (dead cells), G1, S, and G2 phases.
Real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed on ABI
PRISM 7500 Fast instrument using the SYBR Green PCR
Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). β-Actin was
used as an internal control. Primer sequences are available
on request. The ΔΔCt method was used to represent mRNA
fold change.
Statistical analysis. Differences between the means of
unpaired samples were evaluated by the Student's t test
and ANOVA using the SigmaPlot and SigmaStats program.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical
tests were two-sided. Progression-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and χ2 test.

Results
In prostate cancer cells microdissected from patients,
ID1 mRNA was upregulated by chemotherapy and associated with longer relapse-free survival. To identify the molecular signatures associated with chemotherapy, we
compared the gene expression patterns of patients with
high-risk localized prostate cancer before and after chemotherapy with docetaxel and mitoxantrone (35). To avoid possible bias due to different stages of cellular differentiation, we
used LCM to specifically isolate tumor epithelium with the
same Gleason grade from both pretreatment and posttreatment tissues (35). We performed cDNA microarray analyses
using a head-to-head comparison of specimens from the
same patients before and after treatment. We then subtracted gene expression alterations that could be attributed
to surgical procedures and different methods of tissue acquisition (30, 35, 36). We found that the gene encoding ID1 was
significantly upregulated in the postchemotherapy specimens (S1). Subsequently, we confirmed the upregulation by
using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) in 35
patient samples (Fig. 1A). In pretreatment- and posttreatment-matched LCM cancer cells with the same Gleason
score, we found that ID1 was significantly upregulated by
at least 1-fold in 15 of 35 patients (S2). After chemotherapy
and radical prostatectomy surgery, all patients were followed
by quarterly blood PSA test. Patients with confirmed PSA
values higher than 0.4 were considered to have a PSA biochemical relapse (BCR). After a median of 56 months of postchemotherapy–radical prostatectomy follow-up, we found
that 60% (12 of 20) of ID1 stable and 40% (6 of 15) of ID1
upregulation patients developed BCR. The median relapsefree survival was 36.7 months for ID1 stable group and 58.7
months for ID1 upregulation (Fig. 1B). The median time to
develop BCR was 10.9 months for the ID1 stable group, but
43.8 months for ID1 upregulation group, which were significantly different (Fig. 1B). The relapse-free survival analysis

ID1 Overexpression Enhances Chemosensitivity

Figure 1. Chemotherapy-induced ID1 upregulation is
associated with a significant delay in developing BCR.
A, ID1 upregulation in posttreatment cancer epithelium
was confirmed by qRT-PCR. The cDNAs of 35 patients
from posttreatment radical prostatectomy samples and
pretreatment needle biopsy samples were used. For each
patient, ID1 transcript level was measured by qRT-PCR
and quantified using the comparative ΔΔCt method
(post-pre) with actin as an internal control. Data are mean
and SD; *, P < 0.01, paired t test. B, the time of relapse-free

ID1 status.

stratified by the change of ID1 suggested that chemotherapyinduced ID1 upregulation was associated with the delay of
BCR (Fig. 1C). Importantly, Fisher's exact test analysis
showed that the frequencies of relapse were significantly
lower in the ID1 upregulation group compared with the
ID1 stable group 3 years after the chemotherapy–radical
prostatectomy treatment. Specifically, the relapse frequencies for ID1 upregulation versus stable groups were 0% versus
35% after 12 months (P = 0.012), 6.7% versus 50% after
24 months (P = 0.009), and 13.7% versus 50% after 36 months
(P = 0.034). These data suggested that ID1 upregulation possibly plays a role in mediating the chemotherapy efficacy or
disease behavior and delaying the onset of BCR.
Docetaxel upregulates ID1 expression through c-Myc in
prostate cancer cells. We confirmed that ID1 can be upregulated by chemotherapy. We treated the LNCaP prostate
cancer cell line with increasing doses of either docetaxel or
mitoxantrone, and measured the mRNA and protein levels by
qRT-PCR and Western blots, respectively. Docetaxel, but not

www.aacrjournals.org

mitoxantrone (data not shown), was able to induce ID1 mRNA
and protein expression at concentrations of 10 nmol/L and
higher (Fig. 2A and B). In breast cancer cells, ID1 expression
has been associated with c-Myc regulation (37). In B-cell lymphoma, global ChIP analysis revealed an E-box c-Myc binding
site in the ID1 promoter (38). To investigate the molecular
pathways involved in docetaxel-induced ID1 expression, we
measured both c-Myc occupancy and local chromatin structure modifications surrounding the ID1 promoter E-box by
quantitative ChIP in LNCaP cells. We found that c-Myc protein
levels were not significantly altered following docetaxel
(10 nmol/L) treatment (S3) and ID1 overexpression (S4). However, c-Myc occupancy in the ID1 promoter E-box was significantly higher in docetaxel-treated cells than in solvent
controls (Fig. 2C). This increase was accompanied by the increase of histone acetylation that is commonly associated with
transcriptionally active chromatin (Fig. 2C). Further, transient
siRNA inhibiting c-Myc reduced both the basal and docetaxelinduced ID1 mRNA levels in LNCaP (Fig. 2D).

gels. All results are mean and SD of three independent experiments.

Stable ID1 expression enhances docetaxel cytotoxicity in
LNCaP cells. We used the LNCaP cell line with low basal ID1
levels to investigate whether ID1 overexpression mediates
prostate cancer cell response to docetaxel chemotherapy.
We transduced LNCaP cells with pseudo-lentivirus carrying
an ID1 expression cassette. The transduced cell line (LNCaPID1) had stable and robust ID1 expression compared with
the empty-vector control cell line (LNCaP-Ev; Fig. 3A, left).
Using cell proliferation assay, we observed that LNCaP-ID1
cells grew much faster than LNCaP-Ev controls (Fig. 3A,
right). This increase in proliferation was accompanied by a
decrease in G1 phase and an increase in S- and G2-M–phase
cell populations measured by flow cytometry [florescenceassisted cell sorting (FACS); Fig. 3B, left], whereas no significant change in viability or cell death was observed (data
not shown).
Next, we tested the sensitivity of LNCaP-Ev and LNCaPID1 cell lines to chemotherapy. We treated cells with 0, 1,

5, and 15 nmol/L of docetaxel for 48 hours. By counting viable cells based on trypan blue exclusion, we observed that
LNCaP-ID1 cells were significantly less viable than empty
vector cells at both 5 and 15 nmol/L compared with their
respective solvent-treated controls (Fig. 3B, right). FACS
analysis confirmed the enhanced sensitivity. Docetaxel decreased cell cycle progression and increased cell death in both
cell lines. Compared with LNCaP-Ev cells, ID1-expressing cells
had a significantly larger decrease in the G1 phase (S5) and a
larger increase in the sub-G1 (dead cell) population after docetaxel treatment (Fig. 3C, left). The increased cytotoxic effect
was also observed by using Western blot analysis of proteins
involved in the apoptotic pathway associated with docetaxel.
BCL2 phosphorylation at serine 70, which inactivates BCL2
and mediates taxane-based apoptosis (39), was more robust

(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), processes associated with

apoptosis, were more active in docetaxel-treated LNCaP-ID1
than LNCaP-Ev (Fig. 3C, right). In addition, ID1 overexpression in the LNCaP-ID1 cell line caused reductions in mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial mass (S6). Therefore, we
speculate that ID1 overexpression can cause mitochondrial
damage, which in turn sensitizes cells to docetaxel-induced
cytotoxicity.
ID1 siRNA reduces docetaxel cytotoxicity in prostate
cancer cells. We next evaluated ID1 loss-of-function to further elucidate the role of ID1 in mediating chemotherapy.
In the LNCaP cell line, siRNA against ID1 (si-ID1) reduced
docetaxel-induced ID1 expression (Fig. 4A, top). Cells treated
with ID1 siRNA grew significantly slower than the nontargeting siRNA controls (si-Control; Fig. 4A, bottom). Forty-eight
hours after transfection of the siRNA oligos, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of docetaxel for 2 days.
Cells transfected with si-ID1 were less sensitive to docetaxel

than cells transfected with si-Control (Fig. 4B), which was associated with reduced cell death (Fig. 4C) and increased
numbers of cell arrested in G1 (#, Fig. 4D). We also tested
the effect of ID1 siRNA in the C42B prostate cancer cell line,
which expresses a robust amount of endogenous ID1 protein
(Fig. 5A, top). Unlike in LNCaP, docetaxel did not further
induce ID1 expression in C42B (Fig. 5A, bottom). Transient
siRNA consistently reduced ID1 protein levels in C42B cells
over a period of 2 to 5 days (S7). Consistent with the proliferative effect of ID1 seen in LNCaP, ID1 siRNA slightly but
significantly reduced the proliferation of C42B cells (Fig. 5B),
whereas cell death remained trivial (data not shown). ID1
siRNA significantly reduced docetaxel efficacy (Fig. 5C). Time
course experiments indicated that reduced chemosensitivity
was accompanied by a significant reduction of docetaxelinduced cell death in si-ID1 cells compared with the
si-Controls (Fig. 5D).

ID1 sensitizes LNCaP cells to docetaxel through p21
inhibition. To elucidate the potential mechanisms that are
responsible for ID1-enhanced docetaxel sensitivity in LNCaP
cells, we compared gene and/or protein expression of genes
involved in androgen signaling, cytotoxic responses, and cell
cycle/cell death regulation in the LNCaP-Ev and LNCaP-ID1
cell lines. There was no significant change in androgen receptor, p16, p27, Bad, Bax, BCL2, and BCL-xl gene expression
(S8). On the other hand, AKT and c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) signaling in LNCaP-ID1 cells were higher than LNCaP-Ev in
solvent-treated conditions (S9). Consistent with a previous
report (22), PSA expression was significantly upregulated
(S8). However, under both androgen-stimulated (1 nmol/L
R1881) and depleted (charcoal-stripped serum) conditions,
ID1 overexpression equally enhanced docetaxel sensitivity
(S10). Thus, the investigated ID1 pathway seems to be independent of the androgen/androgen receptor pathway. Consistent with the function in repressing cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors, ID1 overexpression repressed p21 expression in LNCaP-ID1 cells (S9). Because p21 has been shown
to attenuate chemotherapy cytotoxicity by inducing cell cycle
arrest but not cell death (40–42), we hypothesized that the
ID1-initiated reduction of p21 was one of the causes for

the enhanced docetaxel sensitivity in LNCaP-ID1 cell line. Indeed, LNCaP-ID1 cells compensated with stable lentiviral p21
overexpression had higher p21 protein levels (Fig. 6A, left),
grew significantly slower (Fig. 6B, left), and were significantly
less sensitive to docetaxel compared with LNCaP-ID1 cells
transduced with a vector control (Fig. 6B, right). Because
the rate of cell cycle can also play a role in chemosensitivity
(43) and the LNCaP-ID1cells grew much faster than LNCaPEv (Fig. 3A, left), we wanted to determine if the loss of docetaxel sensitivity can be recapitulated by merely inhibiting
cell cycle and proliferation without compensating for p21.
We cultured LNCaP-ID1 cells under a fetal bovine serum
(FBS)–depleted condition for 48 hours. Western blot analyses
revealed that p21 levels were not significantly changed
(Fig. 6A, right). Cell proliferation experiments showed significant growth retardation due to FBS depletion (Fig. 6C, left).
However, docetaxel induced similar levels of cytotoxicity in
both fast-proliferating and slow-proliferating LNCaP-ID1
cells (Fig. 6C, right). These data indicate that elevated cell
proliferation rates do not account for enhanced chemosensitivity to docetaxel. On the other hand, the ID1-initiated p21
inhibition contributes to both enhanced cell proliferation
and docetaxel sensitivity.

Discussion
In the current study, we identified ID1 as a molecular enhancer of docetaxel cytotoxicity. Prostate cancer cells with
stable overexpression of ID1 exhibited higher sensitivity to
docetaxel than empty vector controls. This enhanced sensitivity was accompanied by increases in BCL2 phosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and ultimately
cell death. Being an important transcriptional regulator
of cell differentiation, ID1 was expected to affect multiple
pathways, which may in turn influence chemosensitivity.
One of these pathways was investigated here. Consistent
with previous reports, stable ID1 overexpression significantly
decreased the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p21 in the LNCaP cell line. This led to increased
cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, but also enhanced cytotoxicity to docetaxel. We used serum starvation
to slow down the LNCaP-ID1 cell cycle progression and
proliferation, and found that the slow-proliferating cells
were equally sensitive to docetaxel as the fast-proliferating
ones. However, stable p21 overexpression reversed the

www.aacrjournals.org

enhanced cytotoxicity. This suggests that ID1 modulation
of chemosensitivity is proliferation independent but p21
dependent.
The casual relationship of the ID1-p21 pathway and
chemosensitivity enhancement is consistent with the observations made more than a decade ago, in which the p53- and/or
p21-negative cancer cell lines were prone to apoptosis in
response to cytotoxic chemotherapy (40–42). Numerous
studies have shown that p21 is capable of blocking caspase activation induced by both intrinsic and extrinsic cell
deathsignals. The cell cycle regulatory property of p21 was
recently separated from its antiapoptotic function, in which
investigators observed that a small deletion of the p21 protein disrupted its ability to inactivate the ASK1/JNK pathway
but not the ability to initiate cell cycle arrest (44). The JNK
pathway has been shown to mediate the cytotoxicity of
docetaxel. We speculate that one way for ID1 to chemosensitize cells is to downregulate p21, which may lead to
longer and/or more robust activation of JNK signaling as
seen in S8 (45, 46). In addition, we showed that docetaxelinduced ID1 expression was associated with the increased

c-Myc binding at the ID1 promoter E-box. Although c-Myc
is usually associated with cancer cell proliferation, Myc can
also induce synthetic lethality within specific p53-positive
cellular contexts (47, 48). The LNCaP cell line has wild-type
p53, and our current observation is consistent with a
pathway in which docetaxel induces ID1 expression through
c-Myc. ID1 can subsequently inhibit p21, which promotes
cell cycle progression, but also commits cells to death
pathways in response to treatment. Additional mechanisms
leading to ID1 chemosensitization may also exist due to
the pleiotropic effect of ID1. In our study, most of the patients with ID1 upregulation also had ID3 upregulation after
chemotherapy (S1).
The results of our current study both confirm and argue
against some of the existing knowledge regarding the status
and function of ID1 in prostate cancer. Previously, ID1 protein overexpression has been observed in human prostate
cancer specimens (49, 50). However, using matched benign

3246

Cancer Res; 70(8) April 15, 2010

and cancerous prostate epithelium obtained through LCM,
we observed significantly higher ID1 mRNA expression in benign cells (30), and tumor ID1 mRNA levels were higher in
patients who were BCR-free (S11). ONCOMINE analysis also
revealed that ID1 expression decreased as the disease progressed (S12). Using a more specific anti-ID1 antibody, we
did not detect ID1 protein expression in localized prostate
cancer tissues (data not shown), which confirmed a recently
published histologic study using the same antibodies (29).
These data suggest that ID1 overexpression is not associated
with the development of localized prostate cancer. Previous
in vitro experiments have shown that ID1 overexpression enhances cell proliferation, activates several oncogenic signaling cascades, and promotes resistance to paclitaxel. In our
study, we confirmed some of the proliferative and oncogenic
properties of ID1. Further, using more detailed cellular and
biochemical analysis, we showed that expression of ID1 increased prostate cancer cell line responses to docetaxel in

ID1 Overexpression Enhances Chemosensitivity

contrast to the published reports. Part of the discrepancies
between our data and prior studies may be due to differences
in cell lines. Based on our observation that clinical prostate
cancers had low ID1 expression levels, we chose LNCaP as
the primary in vitro model because it has the lowest ID1
mRNA and protein levels among all prostate cancer cell lines
tested. In other studies, investigators primarily used DU-145
and PC-3, which have measurable levels of ID1 protein and a
loss of wild-type p53 function.
These in vitro and in vivo results suggest a potentially
important clinical role for ID1 in cancer therapy. Currently,
docetaxel-based chemotherapy is widely used in treating
cancer; however, the therapeutic efficacy has been hard to
predict. Based on the current results, ID1 mRNA expression
may prove useful as a molecular predictor for docetaxel efficacy in cancer patients after chemotherapy or as a pretreatment marker to select cancer patients who may be more
responsive to specific cytotoxic agents. Further study using
larger independent patient sets would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
