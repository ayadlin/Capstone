Abstract
Excessive signaling from the Wnt pathway is associated with numerous human cancers. Using a high
throughput screen designed to detect inhibitors of Wnt/b-catenin signaling, we identiﬁed a series of acyl
hydrazones that act downstream of the b-catenin destruction complex to inhibit both Wnt-induced and cancerassociated constitutive Wnt signaling via destabilization of b-catenin. We found that these acyl hydrazones bind
iron in vitro and in intact cells and that chelating activity is required to abrogate Wnt signaling and block the
growth of colorectal cancer cell lines with constitutive Wnt signaling. In addition, we found that multiple iron
chelators, desferrioxamine, deferasirox, and ciclopirox olamine similarly blocked Wnt signaling and cell growth.
Moreover, in patients with AML administered ciclopirox olamine, we observed decreased expression of the Wnt
target gene AXIN2 in leukemic cells. The novel class of acyl hydrazones would thus be prime candidates for further
development as chemotherapeutic agents. Taken together, our results reveal a critical requirement for iron in
Wnt signaling and they show that iron chelation serves as an effective mechanism to inhibit Wnt signaling in
humans. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7628–39. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Inappropriate activation of the canonical Wnt/b-catenin
signaling pathway contributes to the development of a numerous human cancers (1–3). In colorectal cancers, loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) are common. APC is an integral part of the
destruction complex that controls cytoplasmic b-catenin
levels by promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation of b-catenin. Cancer-associated mutations in APC, thus lead to constitutively high levels of b-catenin and the concomitant expression of Wnt/b-catenin target genes that are important in cell
growth, survival, and metastasis (1–3). In other cancers, conAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Biochemistry, Donnelly Centre for

stitutive Wnt signaling is achieved by a variety of means, such
as increases in Wnt ligand or decreases in secreted inhibitors
(2). Deregulation of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway has been
reported in acute myeloid leukemias (AML) where expression
of b-catenin is correlated with poor prognosis (4, 5). In addition, Wnt/b-catenin signaling has been shown to be required
for the development of the highly proliferative leukemia stem
cells (LSC), that are thought to maintain leukemias (6). The
widespread deregulation of the Wnt pathway in diverse cancers makes it an attractive therapeutic target (7, 8) and while
several chemical inhibitors of the Wnt pathway have been
identiﬁed (7–11), there remains the need for effective smallmolecule inhibitors appropriate for therapeutic development.
Cancer cells have an increased demand for iron to maintain
robust cell proliferation, yet use of iron chelators for cancer
treatment has only recently been rigorously considered (12–
15). Here, we used a mammalian cell–based screen and identiﬁed a class of acyl hydrazones that block constitutive Wnt
signaling and cell growth through their activity as iron chelators and thereby suggest that iron chelation–based therapies
may be an effective means to target Wnt signaling in cancers.

Iron Chelators Inhibit Wnt/b-Catenin Signaling

Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada), was synthesized by Sundia
MediTech Company. OICR142 and OICR623 were synthesized
by the OICR Medicinal Chemistry Group.
b-catenin-ﬁreﬂy luciferase stabilization assay and high
throughput screen
HEK293 cells, stably expressing a Flag-b-catenin-ﬁreﬂy luciferase fusion protein were plated into 96-well dishes at 1,250 cell
per well. The next day, cells were incubated 1 hour in Minimum
Essential Media with 0.2% fetal calf serum, 1 hour with 1.2
mmol/L compounds, and then Wnt3A or control conditioned
media, prepared as described (17, 18) was added for 16 hours.
Luciferase activity was measured using Bright-Glo (Promega)
10 min after addition, using the CLIPR plate reader (Molecular
Devices). Screens were conducted at the SMART Robotics
Facility at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute. Hits were
identiﬁed by B-score analysis. For validation assays, Flagb-catenin-ﬁreﬂy luciferase was immunoprecipitated from cell
lysates with anti-Flag antibody and collected using Protein G
beads.
Transcriptional reporter, electrophoretic mobility shift
assay, and cell growth assays
Cell lines, from American Type Culture Collection, were
expanded, frozen, and thawed aliquots cultured for less than 6
months. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma, and Wnt
pathway status was monitored using TOPFLASH/FOPFLASH.
Cells were transfected with CMV-bgal and either 5HREluciferase (provided by Dr. Michael Ohh, University of Toronto,
Toronto, ON, Canada), TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH using calcium phosphate (HEK293T) or Lipofectamine 2000 (SW480,
DLD-1, SW620, and HCT116). HEK293T cells were incubated
with compounds for 1 hour prior to overnight incubation with
control or Wnt3A-conditioned medium. For all other cells,
compounds were added 5 hours posttransfection, and cells
were incubated for 24 hours in full serum containing media.
Luciferase activity, normalized to b-galactosidase activity was
measured as previously (17, 18). All results were statistically
signiﬁcant (P < 0.005) using the Student 2-tailed t test at 5 and
10 mmol/L of compound. Iron responsive element (IRE)-binding activity of iron regulatory proteins (IRP) was analyzed by
gel shift assay as described (19). Growth inhibition was determined at 72 hours using the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as
published (20).
GST-E-cadherin pull down assays and immunoblotting
For immunoblotting, cells were lysed and total protein
content was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The
following antibodies were used: anti-Flag M2, rabbit antiFerritin and anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-b-catenin and
anti-HIF1a (BD Biosciences), anti-active b-catenin (Millipore),
and mouse anti-Transferrin Receptor (TfRI; Invitrogen). For
glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-downs, 3 mg of puriﬁed
bacterially produced GST or GST-E-cadherin (cytoplasmic tail
domain) protein (21), bound to glutathione beads, was incubated with whole cell lysates for 1 hour at 4 C to collect the free
cytoplasmic pool of b-catenin. Beads were washed 3 times and
analyzed by immunoblotting.

Measurement of intracellular calcein-chelatable iron
Cells were loaded with 100 mmol/L ferric ammonium citrate
(FAC) for 24 hours (22), washed twice with PBS containing 20
mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.3, loaded with 0.25 mmol/L calcein green
acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM; Molecular Probes) in serumfree medium containing 20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.3 for 15
minutes at 37 C, and then were washed and plated at 50,000
cells/well in a 96-well plate (23). Intracellular ﬂuorescence
intensity of calcein (lex ¼ 485 and lem ¼ 520), a measure of
the amount of labile iron (24), was determined as a function of
time 1 minute before and 10 minutes after compound addition
at 37 C using FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech) microplate
reader.
Microarray analysis and real-time PCR
SW480 cells were incubated with 10 mmol/L OICR623, 100
mmol/L desferioxamine or 50 mmol/L deferasirox or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as control for 6 hours. RNA was isolated
using the PureLink Mini Kit (Invitrogen), and cDNA samples
were hybridized to the GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST array
(Affymetrix) and then scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 at the Center for Applied Genomics. Raw
data were prenormalized using RMA (robust multiarray
average) algorithm, adjusted for batch effects and differentially expressed genes were identiﬁed using LIMMA (linear
models for microarray data; ref. 25). Data are available at
GEO (GSE32369). Real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR
Green (Applied Biosystems) using validated primers (Supplementary Table S1). Gene expression was normalized to
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and relative quantitation was calculated using the DDCt method. Results
shown are statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.005) using the
Student 2-tailed t test.
Clinical trial of oral ciclopirox olamine in patients with
refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies
Patients were treated with ciclopirox olamine at increasing concentrations from 5 to 80 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, in a
phase I clinical trial, following informed consent and REB
approval by the Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto,
Canada (NCT00990587). Peripheral blood samples were
obtained before, during, and after drug treatment. Mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma
Chemical) density-gradient centrifugation and AML blasts
isolated by magnetic bead separation.

Results
Identiﬁcation of small-molecule inhibitors of Wnt
signaling
The deleterious effects of constitutive Wnt signaling result
from abnormally high levels of b-catenin protein (1). Thus, to
identify small-molecule inhibitors that reverse b-catenin
accumulation, we designed a homogeneous high throughput
screening (HTS) assay using HEK293 cells stably expressing a
fusion protein comprising ﬁreﬂy luciferase (FFluc) linked to
b-catenin in which fusion protein levels were measured using a
luciferase assay (Fig. 1A). Cells were treated with compounds

Iron Chelators Inhibit Wnt/b-Catenin Signaling

M-110, a structural variant of 21H7, also inhibited stabilization of b-catenin-FFluc and Wnt/b-catenin–dependent activation of TOPFLASH with no effect on FOPFLASH (Fig. 1G–I)
as did compound OICR623, which contains the more polar
pyrimidine group and a 2-ﬂuoro-4-chloro phenolic moiety (Fig.
1G and J). In contrast, OICR142, which lacks the orthohydroxy
group rendered the compound inactive (Fig. 1G and J). Thus,
our screen identiﬁed a class of acyl hydrazones that inhibit
Wnt-induced transcriptional responses.
Inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and cell
proliferation in colorectal cancer cells
Most colorectal cancer cell lines display constitutive Wnt
signaling because of mutations in APC. M-110 treatment of
APC-mutant DLD-1 cells (26), preferentially attenuated constitutive TOPFLASH activity as compared with FOPFLASH,
and had no effect on the CMV-b-galactosidase control reporter
(Fig. 2A). Real-time PCR analysis also revealed that M-110
inhibited expression of the endogenous Wnt targets, AXIN2
and SP5 (Fig. 2B). In other APC mutant colorectal cancer cell
lines, including SW480, SW620, and Colo205, M-110 similarly
reduced TOPFLASH activity (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and
expression of Wnt target genes (Fig. 2C). OICR623 and 21H7
also inhibited Wnt activity, whereas compound OICR142,
which lacks the orthohydroxy group did not (Fig. 2D; see
also Fig. 5). The Wnt/b-catenin pathway regulates cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells. Consistent with this, M-110,
OICR623, and 21H7 inhibited the growth of DLD-1 and SW480
cells, with IC50 values in the range of 0.5 to 1.7 mmol/L (Fig. 2E
and Supplementary Fig. S1B). Thus, this family of small molecules inhibits constitutive Wnt signaling and blocks the growth
of colorectal cancer cell lines.
Acyl hydrazones block Wnt signaling by promoting
b-catenin degradation downstream of the destruction
complex
There are 2 cellular pools of b-catenin, plasma membrane Ecadherin-associated and Wnt-modulated cytoplasmic pools
(27). In mouse L cells, where most of the b-catenin is cytoplasmic, M-110, OICR623, and 21H7 blocked Wnt-induced
stabilization of total b-catenin and the active, nonphosphorylated (S37/T41) b-catenin, which mediates Wnt signaling (Fig.
3A). In SW480 cells, M-110 also decreased the levels of free
cytoplasmic b-catenin as determined by E-cadherin pull down
assays, which collects b-catenin that is not prebound to Ecadherin, and reduced the pool of the active, nonphosphorylated b-catenin (Fig. 3B). Total b-catenin levels, which include
the E-cadherin-bound pool were not signiﬁcantly affected (Fig.
3B), nor were b-catenin mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Degradation of b-catenin occurs in a destruction complex
comprising Axin and APC, within which CK1 and GSK3bmediated phosphorylation of b-catenin marks it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (1). DLD-1 and SW480 cells have a
mutant APC, suggesting that the compounds act downstream
of the destruction complex. Consistent with this, M-110 also
blocked Wnt signaling when other destruction complex components were disrupted, including abrogation of AXIN1/2
expression using siRNAs or inhibition of GSK3b activity using

www.aacrjournals.org

LiCl or I3M (Fig. 3C and D). The ability of M-110 to decrease the
levels of active b-catenin was mitigated in the presence of
MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, but not by chloroquine, a
lysosomal inhibitor (Fig. 3E), indicating ubiquitin-mediated
degradation of b-catenin. M-110, OICR623, and 21H7 also
inhibited activation of the TOPFLASH reporter in HCT116
cells, which harbor a constitutively-active version of b-catenin
and in HEK293T cells overexpressing versions of b-catenin
lacking the phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3F and G; Supplementary Fig. S1D). Altogether, these data show that the compounds
act downstream of the destruction complex to destabilize
active b-catenin.
Gene expression proﬁling reveals compounds induce an
iron chelation signature
To gain insights into molecular mechanisms, we used
microarrays to examine changes in gene expression in SW480
cells treated for 6 hours with OICR623. Analysis of results from
replicate runs revealed that OICR623 signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
upregulated the expression of 31 genes by 1.5-fold or greater
(Fig. 4A and B) including several genes induced by iron
chelators (28), such as DDIT4, VEGFA, and NDRG1. This gene
proﬁle was next compared with that obtained using 2 welldescribed iron chelators, desferioxamine and deferasirox in
cells treated in parallel. At 6 hours of treatment, 64 and 72 genes
were upregulated by greater than 1.5-fold (P < 0.05) by desferioxamine and deferasirox, respectively, of which 64 overlapped
(Fig. 4A). Remarkably, all 31 genes upregulated by OICR623
were found within the desferioxamine/deferasirox signature.
Similar results were observed in the case of signiﬁcantly (1.5fold, P < 0.05) downregulated genes, although this overlap set
comprised only 4 genes (Fig. 4B). Of note, at this early time
point, inhibition of Wnt target gene expression was not yet
manifested. These results thus show that the OICR623-induced
gene signature is entirely encompassed by that of the iron
chelators, desferioxamine and deferasirox.
Iron depletion inhibits the activity of iron-dependent
enzymes, including prolyl hydroxylases (PHD), which promote
stabilization of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor,
HIF1a (29, 30). Treatment of SW480 and DLD-1 cells with
OICR623, M-110, and 21H7, stabilized HIF1a and activated a
HIF1a transcriptional reporter, 5xHRE-luciferase (Fig. 4C and
D). Furthermore, genes induced by OICR623, desferioxamine,
and deferasirox in the microarray analysis included the known
HIF1a targets (29), VEGFA, ADM, EGLN3, and NDRG1 (Fig. 4A).
Veriﬁcation of microarray results by real-time PCR showed
that all 3 acyl hydrazones, OICR623, M-110, and 21H7, as well as
the iron chelators, desferioxamine and deferasirox, rapidly
induced expression of the iron-dependent and/or HIF1a target
genes, NDRG1, DDIT4, VEGFA, and GLUT1 in SW480 cells, used
for the microarray study and in DLD-1 and SW620 cells (Fig. 4E
and Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
Under conditions of iron depletion, IRPs recognize and
bind to IREs in mRNAs such as Ferritin (Ft), to stall translation
or to TfRI mRNA to enhance mRNA stability and translation
(14). As expected for iron chelators, treatment of SW480 cells
with M-110 or deferasirox resulted in enhanced IRE–IRP
binding activity, in an RNA-binding gel shift assay (Fig. 4F).

observed by immunoblotting for M-110 (Fig. 4F) and OICR623,
21H7, and deferasirox (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Thus, given

the gene expression proﬁles and characteristic cell-based
responses of iron depletion, our data strongly suggest that
OICR623 and related compounds act as iron chelators.

Compounds bind iron in vitro and in cultured cells and
this activity mediates inhibition of Wnt signaling and cell
growth
The acyl hydrazone group is a characteristic metal chelating
motif, thus, to test whether OICR623 can bind iron in vitro, we
mixed Fe (NO3)39H2O with OICR623 and analyzed the mixture
by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. An iron complex of OICR623 in a 1:2 ratio (iron:OICR623) with a molecular
ion mass [Mþ1] of 698 was observed. On the basis of the
reported crystal and molecular structure of Compound 311
and its iron (III) complex (31), we speculate that OICR623 is a
tridendate chelator (Fig. 5A).

We next assessed the ability of the compounds to bind
intracellular iron in colorectal cell lines by calcein assay. Upon
cell entry, calcein-AM is cleaved into calcein, whose ﬂuorescence is quenched upon chelation of labile iron (23). CalceinAM–loaded SW480 cells were brieﬂy incubated with M-110,
OICR623, and 21H7. Similar to the iron chelator, deferasirox,
both M-110 and OICR623 increased calcein ﬂuorescence (Fig.
5B), whereas 21H7 yielded a more modest increase that was
similar to that observed for desferioxamine, an iron chelator
with poor cell-permeability properties (32). We next tested the

(5 mmol/L) coincubated with a 2-fold molar excess (10 mmol/L)
of various divalent cations revealed that addition of FeSO4 or
FAC completely neutralized compound activity, whereas
Mg2þ, Mn2þ, or Zn2þ salts had no effect (Fig. 5C). Moreover,
in cell growth assays, addition of FeSO4 at an equimolar ratio of
iron to compound completely abrogated the inhibitory activity
of the compounds in SW480 and DLD-1 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Treatment of DLD-1 or SW480 cells with the structurally unrelated iron chelators, desferioxamine or deferasirox,
similarly inhibited expression of Wnt target genes (Fig. 5D) and
inhibited cell growth with IC50 values of 2.9 to 3.0 mmol/L (Fig.
5E), roughly 5- to 10-fold higher than the acyl hydrazones, but
similar to previously reported IC50 values for these compounds
(Fig. 5D and E; ref. 33). Stabilization of HIF1a and activation of
the HIF1a reporter, 5xHRE-luciferase by DMOG, an inhibitor of
2-oxoglutarate–dependent enzymes including PHDs, to levels
(0.1 mmol/L) comparable as that achieved by acyl hydrazones
or deferasirox, had no effect on TOPFLASH activity, though at
10-fold higher DMOG doses, some inhibition was observed
suggesting that HIF1a is unlikely to be the primary mechanism
whereby iron chelators inhibit Wnt signaling (Supplementary
Fig. S3C).
Altogether, our results showed that acyl hydrazones are
potent iron chelators in cells and that depletion of intracellular
iron abrogates cell proliferation and Wnt signaling by promoting b-catenin degradation downstream of the destruction
complex.
Oral administration of the iron chelator, ciclopirox
olamine, reduces Wnt target gene expression in the
leukemic cells of patients with AML
Ciclopirox olamine functions as an anticancer agent in both
leukemic cell lines and primary AML patient samples via its
intracellular iron chelation activity (34). We conﬁrmed in
SW480 cells that ciclopirox olamine also binds intracellular
iron (Fig. 5B), induces the HIF1a responsive reporter,
and inhibits TOPFLASH in an iron-dependent manner (Fig.
6A and B).
Mutations in Wnt pathway components have not been
reported in AML, but expression of b-catenin is correlated
with poor prognosis (5). Thus, to determine if iron chelators
modulate Wnt signaling in vivo, we assessed the effect of
systemic administration of ciclopirox olamine to patients with
refractory hematologic malignancies. Expression of AXIN2 in
patients with AML taking orally administered ciclopirox olamine as part of an on-going phase I dose escalation trial was
determined in isolated leukemic blasts. Analysis of samples
from 9 patients with relapsed AML receiving ciclopirox olamine doses between 5 and 80 mg/m2 daily for 5 days revealed
that 7 of 9 patients displayed a decrease in AXIN2 levels. For
4 patients (A–D), marked decreases were detected within 1 day
of ciclopirox olamine administration (day 2) that became more
pronounced from days 3 to 5 (Fig. 6C and D). In 3 patients
(E–G), decreases in AXIN2 levels were transient, whereas in
2 patients (H and I), there was no reduction (Fig. 6C and D).
Excluding the 2 patients (H and I) who showed no changes, the
average reduction in AXIN2 levels from days 2 to 5 ranged from
60% to 74% (median) or 40% to 71% (mean; Fig. 6D). Of note,

7636

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

hematopoietic cells isolated from 2 ciclopirox olamine–administered patients (J–K) with myeloma or MDS, but lacking
circulating malignant cells showed no reduction in AXIN2
(Fig. 6E), suggesting that leukemic cells may be more susceptible to iron chelation than non-malignant hematopoietic cells.
Although only a small, short-term study, these results show
that administration of iron chelators can decrease the expression of Wnt target genes in patients with hematologic malignancies and further indicate that iron chelators might be of
therapeutic value for Wnt pathway driven tumors.

Discussion
Stabilization of b-catenin is an invariant feature of cancers
with excessive Wnt signaling (1, 2). Our screen, designed to
identify small molecules that destabilize b-catenin, identiﬁed a
compound series that inhibits b-catenin stabilization and
blocks Wnt-induced transcription. The compounds were
shown to function downstream of the b-catenin destruction
complex and were effective in blocking Wnt signaling and
growth in APC and b-catenin mutant colorectal cancer cells
with constitutive Wnt signaling. This is consistent with studies
showing that downregulation of b-catenin inhibits proliferation of colon cancer cell lines grown in vitro or as xenografts
(35, 36). Given the frequent occurrence of excessive Wnt
signaling through a range of mechanisms, these inhibitors
which act downstream of the destruction complex to control
b-catenin levels could have widespread therapeutic utility in a
diverse range of Wnt-driven cancers.
Investigation of the mechanism whereby the acyl hydrazones block the Wnt pathway showed that the compounds
bind iron and that this iron chelation activity is essential for
compound activity. Iron loading of colorectal cancer cells has
been reported to promote Wnt signaling and cell proliferation
(37) consistent with our observations that iron depletion can
attenuate the pathway. Our conclusions were further supported by the observation that a series of structurally unrelated
iron chelators, including desferioxamine, deferasirox, and
ciclopirox olamine also inhibit Wnt signaling and that patients
with AML taking ciclopirox olamine, show a marked reduction
in the expression of the Wnt target gene, AXIN2. Our work
along with a recent study (38) show that iron depletion
attenuates Wnt signaling, but which of the plethora of irondependent proteins, are most relevant for inhibiting Wnt
signaling remains to be determined.
Iron is essential for cell growth and metabolism and cancer
cells in particular, have an increased demand for iron to
maintain cell proliferation having acquired diverse alterations
to ensure increased iron accumulation (12–15). In breast
cancer, decreases of the intracellular iron exporter, ferroportin,
is associated with reduced metastasis-free survival, whereas
ferroportin overexpression decreases breast cancer cell growth
in an orthotopic mouse model (39). Expression levels of
ferroportin are correlated with levels of intracellular iron,
indicating that altering iron levels can modulate tumor growth
in vivo. It is thus tempting to speculate that an increase in iron
accumulation promotes widespread increases in the proproliferative Wnt signaling pathway to promote tumorigenesis.
