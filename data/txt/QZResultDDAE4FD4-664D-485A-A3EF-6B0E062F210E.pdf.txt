Abstract
There are no clinically relevant treatments available that improve function in the growing
population of very preterm infants (<32 weeks gestation) with neonatal brain injury. Diffuse white
matter injury (DWMI) is a common finding in these children and results in chronic
neurodevelopmental impairments1,2. As shown recently, failure in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell
maturation contributes to DWMI3. In a previous study, we demonstrated that epidermal growth

factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in oligodendrocyte development4. Here, we
examine whether enhanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling stimulates the
endogenous response of EGFR-expressing progenitor cells during a critical period after brain
injury, and promotes cellular and behavioral recovery in the developing brain. Using an
established model of very preterm brain injury, we demonstrate that selective overexpression of
human (h)EGFR in oligodendrocyte lineage cells or the administration of intranasal heparin
binding EGF immediately after injury decreases oligodendroglia death, enhances generation of
new oligodendrocytes from progenitor cells (OPCs) and promotes functional recovery.
Furthermore, these interventions diminish ultrastructural abnormalities and alleviate behavioral
deficits on white matter-specific paradigms. Inhibition of EGFR signaling with a molecularly
targeted agent used for cancer therapy demonstrates that EGFR activation is an important
contributor to oligodendrocyte regeneration and functional recovery after DWMI. Thus, our study
provides direct evidence that targeting EGFR in OPCs at a specific time after injury is clinically
feasible and applicable for the treatment of premature children with white matter injury.
Chronic neonatal hypoxia (Hyp) is a clinically relevant model of premature brain injury
caused by insufficient gas exchange from poor lung development5. This ‘hypoxic’ state is a
major contributor to DWMI – a common finding in infants born very preterm (VPT),
resulting in sensori-motor deficits that persist throughout their lifetime1,2,6. We used a
mouse model of chronic Hyp, which replicates DWMI and other neuropathologic hallmarks
of brain injury resulting from premature birth7–9.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying DWMI in VPT children - and in Hyp are unknown. It has been previously demonstrated that enhanced EGFR signaling in WM
OL lineage cells promotes their proliferation, migration, myelination and remyelination in
the adult4,10. We observed a significant increase in endogenous EGF levels in WM after
Hyp (Extended Data Fig. 1). Therefore, we compared OL development in WM injury and
recovery in 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) enhanced fluorescent green
protein (GFP) mice (Rep mice) and Rep mice in which hEGFR was overexpressed in the OL
lineage under the CNP promoter (Rep-hEGFR mice)4,11–13. Hyp decreased myelin basic
protein (MBP) expression in WM of Rep mice, but not in Rep-hEGFR mice (Fig. 1a–e). At
P60, MBP expression recovered in the Hyp Rep group (Fig. 1e). At P11, Hyp did not cause
any change in the number of Rep+Olig2+ cells and mature (Rep+CC1+) OLs (Fig. 1f). At
P18, we observed a decrease in Rep+Olig2+ and Rep+CC1+ OLs in the WM of Hyp Rep
mice (Fig. 1g), but no change in the Rep-hEGFR mice. OL recovery was evident by P60 in
the Hyp Rep group (Fig. 1h).

There was an increase in apoptosis of OL lineage cells in Rep mice after Hyp at P11 and
P18, but no change at P60 (Extended Data Fig. 2e). No significant apoptosis was observed
in Rep-hEGFR mice (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Hyp caused an increase in the number of
Propidium Iodide (PI)+ cells (data not shown) and Rep+PI+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d,
f). This increase was not observed in Rep-hEGFR mice. These results indicate that enhanced
EGFR expression prevents OL loss by decreasing cell death after Hyp.
We next assessed the effects of Hyp on OL progenitor (Rep+NG2+) cells (OPCs) in WM
(Extended Data Fig. 2g–k). Enhanced hEGFR expression caused an increase in Rep+NG2+

OPCs at P11 and P18 (Extended Data Fig. 2k; Nx Rep vs. Nx Rep-hEGFR). Hyp caused a
significant increase in WM OPCs in both Rep and Rep-hEGFR mice at the same ages
(Extended Data Fig. 2k). Similar findings were obtained after assessing proliferation of
Rep+ OL lineage cells (Extended Data Fig. 2l). Enhanced hEGFR expression increased
Rep+NG2+ OPC proliferation in Nx, and had an additive effect on Hyp-induced OPC
proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 2m). Enhanced hEGFR expression increased
oligodendrogenesis at P18, but, at P30, no difference was evident between Hyp Rep and
Hyp Rep-hEGFR (Fig. 1i). These results indicate that enhanced hEGFR expression in OLs
promoted generation of new OLs after Hyp.

We used electron microscopy (EM) to determine whether Hyp caused myelination
abnormalities, and to assess whether EGFR overexpression rescued these abnormalities.
(Fig. 1j–o). At P60, when OL cell numbers and MBP expression recovered, myelination was
still abnormal after Hyp (Fig. 1j–o). Hyp caused a significant increase in g-ratio and hEGFR
expression prevented this increase (Fig. 1n,o).
Next, we investigated behavioral deficits resulting from DWMI after perinatal Hyp by using
subcortical WM-dependent sensori-motor behavioral tests (complex wheel and inclined
beam-walking task)14–18. In the complex wheel, there was no difference in training
maximum velocity (Vmax) between all 4 groups (Fig. 1p). On day 15, all 4 groups had a
decline in Vmax, however the largest decline was in the Hyp Rep group (Fig. 1p). The Hyp
Rep group performed poorly on the complex wheel (days 15–21), as compared to the other 3
groups (Fig. 1p), suggesting altered subcortical WM integrity.

Author Manuscript

The inclined beam-walking task17,18 requires subcortical WM integrity (Extended Data Fig.
3a–c) and no difference was observed between Rep mice and C57Bl/6 mice (Extended Data
Fig. 3d). At P30, the Hyp Rep group displayed more foot slips than the Nx Rep group (Fig.
1q). The Hyp Rep-hEGFR mice displayed no significant increase in the number of foot slips
as compared with Nx Rep-hEGFR group. At P60, the Hyp Rep group continued to display
an increase in number of foot slips, while the Hyp Rep-hEGFR group had no difference
(Fig. 1r). These behavioral studies confirm that Hyp during a critical period in myelin
development results in poor performance on WM-specific behavioral tasks. Enhanced EGFR
activity prevents the effects of Hyp, strongly suggesting that EGFR signaling in OL lineage
cells plays a crucial role in WM recovery after perinatal injury.

Author Manuscript

We directly tested the role of endogenous EGFR signaling in OL recovery after Hyp by
Gefitinib administration from P12-P18 (Fig. 2a). Gefitinib, a specific EGFR antagonist19,
caused a small reduction in basal phosphorylated (p)EGFR levels in WM of Nx mice at P18,
but completely prevented the increase in pEGFR induced by Hyp (Fig. 2b). Gefitinib caused
a decrease of WM Rep+Olig2+ and Rep+CC1+ OL lineage cells in Nx (Fig. 2c). Hyp
resulted in a decrease of these cell populations, which were further reduced by Gefitinib
(Fig. 2c). This decrease was attributed to a significant increase in OL apoptosis in both Nx
and Hyp (Fig. 2d). Gefitinib also decreased NG2+ OPCs in Nx WM, and prevented their
increase observed after Hyp (Fig. 2e). Similarly, Gefitinib decreased WM OL linage cell
proliferation in Nx and prevented the proliferative response observed after Hyp (Fig. 2f).
Gefitinib also decreased Sox2- and Ascl1-expressing progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 4a–e

and f–j, respectively). At P30, Gefitinib still caused a decrease in OL lineage cells and
mature OLs in Nx, and prevented OL recovery and oligodendrogenesis observed after Hyp
(Fig. 2g,h). Finally, Gefitinib prevented the recovery in CNPase and MBP protein levels
observed after Hyp at P30 (Fig. 2i). These results confirm that endogenous EGFR signaling
is important in WM cellular and biochemical recovery after Hyp.

We wanted to examine whether directly targeting EGFR with a selective ligand
[recombinant heparin binding EGF (HB-EGF)] via intranasal route promoted cellular
recovery of WM OLs after Hyp. The clinical relevance of targeting endogenous OLs was
demonstrated by the presence of EGFR-expressing OL lineage cells (Olig2+EGFR+) in
neonatal preterm human WM (Figure 3a). The intranasal route allows rapid drug delivery
directly to the brain from the nasal mucosa20–22. HB-EGF via intranasal route entered the
brain20,23 and acts on WM (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c), where Rep+pEGFR+ cells could be
identified (Extended Data Fig. 5d). FACS-purification of Hyp WM Rep+ cells after HBEGF treatment directly demonstrated activation of EGFR in OL lineage cells (Extended
Data Fig. 5e). Treatment with 7 doses of intranasal HB-EGF from P11-P14 (Fig. 3b)
prevented WM OL lineage cell loss after Hyp (Fig. 3c). Rep+ cells were stained for
caspase-3 in all groups. At all ages examined, HB-EGF treatment reduced (P15) or
prevented (P18) the effects of Hyp on OL cell death (Fig. 3d).

Author Manuscript

HB-EGF treatment also caused an increase in WM Rep+NG2+ OPCs in both Nx and Hyp
groups, and enhanced OPC proliferation (Fig. 3e,f)24. To determine whether OL recovery
was a result of increased oligodendrogenesis from this expanded pool of proliferative OPCs,
we performed BrdU-pulse chase labeling of newly generated OLs. HB-EGF increased the
number of Rep+CC1+BrdU+ cells under Nx and Hyp conditions at P18 (Fig. 3g). At P30, the
additive effect of Hyp and HB-EGF was not as evident (Fig. 3g). Genetic lineage tracing of
OLs in vivo by using the platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor [PDGFαRCreER:Z/EG] (GFP+) reporter mouse (Extended Data Fig. 6; Fig. 3h)25 confirmed that Hyp
and HB-EGF treatment have an additive effect on the generation of Olig2-expressing cells
(Extended Data Fig. 6j). Conversely, PDGFαR-driven EGFR deletion in OPCs prevented
the cellular effects of HB-EGF on NG2+ OPCs (Fig. 3i). HB-EGF treatment after Hyp also
resulted in recovery of MBP and Proteolipid Protein (PLP) expression (Fig. 3j). These
results indicate that, after Hyp, HB-EGF promotes expansion of the OPC pool, and OL
regeneration and maturation.

Author Manuscript

EM analysis revealed that HB-EGF treatment rescued the increase in g-ratio observed in
Hyp and partially prevented the decrease in % of myelinated axons (Fig. 4a–f; Extended
Data Fig. 7). Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) demonstrated that, at P60, fractional
anisotropy (FA) values are significantly decreased in corpus callosum, cingulum and
external capsule regions of Hyp mice, but not in the HB-EGF-treated Hyp group (Fig. 4g–j).
Electrophysiological analysis of extracellular compound action potentials (CAPs)
demonstrated that HB-EGF prevented the decrease in amplitude of myelinated axons
observed after Hyp (Fig. 4k). Finally, analysis of N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA) in WM
decreased levels at P18 and P30, which was prevented by HB-EGF (Fig. 4l; Extended Data
Fig. 8).

On the complex wheel, Hyp HB-EGF-treated mice had similar performance to the Nx Saline
group (Fig. 4m). Furthermore, in the inclined beam-walking task, HB-EGF treatment
completely prevented Hyp-induced behavioral deficit tested on the 2cm-width beam, and
reduced the effects of Hyp tested on the 1cm-width beam (Fig. 4n,o). Importantly, when
HB-EGF treatment was performed at P18-P21, it had no effect on the Hyp-induced
behavioral phenotype (Fig. 4p; Extended Data Fig. 9).

Author Manuscript

Importantly, HB-EGF strongly inhibited Hyp-induced upregulation of Notch signaling
elements (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c) and functional activation of Notch in WM Olig2+ OL
lineage cells (Extended Data Fig. 10d–h), which could be at least in part responsible for
delayed OL maturation after perinatal injury26. These results are consistent with the notion
that HB-EGF accelerated OPC maturation after Hyp through inhibition of Notch11, and
indicates that HB-EGF treatment promotes functional recovery during a critical
developmental time window for effective therapeutic intervention.
Our results reveal that activating EGF/EGFR signaling promotes cellular and functional
recovery after neonatal brain injury. Enhancing EGFR signaling through overexpression of
the EGFR prevents DWMI, promotes the generation of new OLs and prevents behavioral
deficits in different WM-related tasks. Furthermore, a brief pharmacological treatment that
targets endogenous EGFRs using a clinically feasible (intranasal) mode of entry during a
critical window promotes cellular, developmental, myelin structural improvement and
behavioral recovery. Intranasal treatment is a plausible route to introduce sufficient HB-EGF
into the brain and WM of critically ill VPT infants.

METHODS
Author Manuscript

Animals

Author Manuscript

The CNP-EGFP (Rep) and CNP-EGFP-hEGFR (Rep-hEGFR) strains were generated as
described previously and backcrossed to a C57BL/6 genetic background greater than 9
generations29–31. The Rep-hEGFR mice used for these experiments were crossed with
heterozygote Rep mice to ensure that all pups were positive for green fluorescent protein
(GFP), but not all expressed hEGFR. This ensured littermate controls. For experiments that
required only Rep line of mice, a Rep adult mouse was crossed with a C57BL/6 (Jackson
laboratories). Only mice that expressed green fluorescent protein (Rep) during screening on
postnatal day 2 with ultraviolet goggles were used. The PDGFαR-CreERT2 (Courtesy of
Dr. Dwight Bergles; referred in the text as PDGFαR-CreER) was crossed with Z/EG
reporter mice (Jackson Laboratories; stock number 003920) and genotyped as previously
reported32. Z/EG reporter mice were crossed with EGFRfl/fl33 followed by PDGFαR-CreER
transgenic mice. These mice were backcrossed to ensure homozygote EGFRfl/fl so that all
mice were PDGFαR-CreER;EGFRfl/fl;Z/EG. The Ascl1GFP mice (Jackson Laboratories,
stock 012881; also known as Mash1) were used to determine the effects of Gefitinib on
white matter (WM) Ascl1-expressing cells. In this study, unless described below or in the
figure legends, only male mice were used due to male preterm children displaying more
clinically relevant injury and neurological deficits compared to females34,35. All animal
procedures were performed according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee

Hypoxic rearing

Author Manuscript

Mice were randomly chosen to either undergo Hypoxic (Hyp) rearing or serve as Normoxia
(Nx) controls. The Hyp mice were placed in a sealed chamber maintaining O2 concentration
at 10.5% by displacement with N2 as described previously36–38. Hyp began at P3 for 8 days
until P11. This time window in rodent WM oligodendrocyte (OL) development reproduces
changes that occur at 23–40 weeks of gestation in the human brain39. A separate group of
mice from the same breeding cage were used for age and strain matched Normoxia (Nx)
controls. Genotyping (CNP-hEGFR; PDGFαR-CreER;Z/EG; Ascl1GFP; and EGFRfl/fl) was
performed at P11 by PCR of tissue obtained from the tail as previously reported29,30,32,33.
Time points chosen for immunohistochemistry or protein quantification were P11, P15, P18,
P30 and P60.
BrdU administration
The BrdU labeling protocol was performed in all mice as follows: Mice were injected
intraperitoneal (IP) at the same time of the day with BrdU (50μg/g body weight) daily for
four days (P11-P14) in the morning. In studies using HB-EGF or Gefitinib, BrdU was
administered one hour prior to vehicle or drug administration.
Gefitinib administration

Author Manuscript

Gefitinib (Iressa; Tocris (Astra Zeneca)) was prepared with strong sonication in a 25%
DMSO and 75% sunflower seed oil at a concentration of 10mg/mL. Male mice in each litter
were randomly chosen to receive either drug or vehicle. The drug dose for this study was 75
mg/kg/day and administered once daily. Equal amount of vehicle was administered to
control animals. A total of 7 doses of vehicle or drug were administered beginning at P12.
HB-EGF administration

Author Manuscript

The intranasal route allows for small molecules to rapidly enter the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from the nasal cavity, followed by subsequent distribution to the brain and spinal
cord40–43. Recombinant human heparin binding epidermal growth factor constituent free
(HB-EGF; R&D Biosciences) was prepared using 0.45% normal sterile saline solution
(Saline) at a concentration of 10μg/mL and stored at −20°C Mice were randomized to the
vehicle (Saline) or HB-EGF group. Saline or HB-EGF was administered intranasally at no
more than 5μL increments 5–10 minutes apart for a total of 100 nanograms/gram (ng/g). The
mouse was held ventral-side up, and a small-modified 27-French catheter was inserted into
either nare. Saline or drug was slowly administered and mouse was held for 1–2 minutes to
ensure absorption. Drug or Saline was administered every 12 hours beginning on the
evening of P11.
Immunohistochemistry and antibodies
Freshly cut, free-floating brain sections (40 μ thick) from P11-P60 mice were prepared as
described previously29,30,36,38. Primary antibody dilutions were 1:500 for anti-BrdU

referred as CC1, Millipore) and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (caspase-3; Millipore); 1:250 for
anti-MBP (Covance); and 1:500 anti-EGFR phosphorylated Tyr1068 (Novus Biologicals).
Sections were incubated at room temperature for one-to-three hours, followed by overnight
at 4 °C in primary antibodies diluted in 0.1M phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1%
Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum (vol/vol). Three washes were performed with cold
1x PBS prior to secondary antibodies being administered. The secondary antibodies (1:200)
used were AlexaFluor 488, AlexaFluor 546 and AlexaFluor 633 conjugated goat anti-rabbit,
anti-rat or anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies
for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by three 1x PBS washes. Sections were treated
with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10–15 min at room
temperature and mounted with Mowiol. Human tissue was obtained from a deceased 3-day
old infant born at 36-week gestation with approval from Children’s National Institutional
Review Board. Sections of corpus callosum and periventricular region were removed after
fixation of the brain for 2 weeks in formalin solution. Tissue was kept in PBS for 1 week
with daily changes of PBS solution to remove excess formalin. The brain was then placed in
20% glycerol solution for 24 hours. Freshly cut, free-floating sections (40 μ thick) were
made on a sliding microtome. Sections were immunostained as described above.
Microscopy and cell counting

Author Manuscript

All fluorescent images were taken on a Zeiss LSM confocal laser-scanning microscope with
sequential scanning mode using 40x oil objectives. Microscopy and cell counting were as
recently described44,45. Z-stack images of 1 μm thick single plane were captured through the
entire thickness of the slice and each cell was analyzed using Zeiss LSM Image Browser
(version 4.2) in its entire z-axis to exclude false double labeling due to overlay of signals
from different cells. Four different laser lines were used to image localization of FITC (488
nm excitation; 522/35 emission filter), CY3 (560 nm excitation; 605/32 emission filter), Cy5
(647 nm excitation; 680/32 emission filter), and DAPI (400 nm excitation). Data acquisition
and processing were controlled by modified LSM software. Analysis of
immunofluorescence was performed on confocal z-stack as previously described44,45. Cells
were counted in 225 × 225 × 10μm (X,Y,Z planes) images for cells/volume quantifications.
Data were obtained from an average of 6 tissue sections per mouse per immunostain.
Analysis of subcortical WM - rostral to the hippocampus - was performed in the corpus
callosum, cingulum and external capsule. Cells were counted in a blinded fashion. The
merged image for each confocal z-stack was analyzed and positive immunofluorescence
identified for each individual channel counted double or triple labeled cells. Merged images
were processed in Photoshop CS5.5 with minimal manipulation of contrast.

Propidium iodide
To assess loss of membrane integrity and increased plasmalemma permeability in vivo,
propidium iodide was used as demonstrated previously46. Propidium iodide (10mg/mL;
Sigma) was diluted in 0.9% NaCl and 1mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally 1 hour
prior to sacrifice. As described above, mice were perfused, brains collected in all groups and
free floating brain sections (40 μ thick) were prepared. Sections were washed, incubated
with DAPI for 10 minutes, washed and then mounted on a slide. Propidium iodide (PI) emits

visualize the GFP+ PI+ Dapi+ cells.
Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

For Western blot analysis of WM lysates, the subcortical WM was dissected on ice-cold
medium from 300–400 μm-thick sections as previously described29,36,38. Briefly, brains
were sliced coronally and only sections anterior to the hippocampus were used. Using
Roboz – a fine-straight and fine-angled microdissecting forceps under a dissecting
microscope – the cortex was dissected away leaving the subcortical WM attached to the
striatum. The WM was then easily pushed away from the striatum, leaving only WM tissue.
The dissected WM was rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and then lysed on ice in 150–200 μl of
RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined by using
the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-rad). Western blot analysis was performed using 10–40
μg of total cell lysates. Proteins were resolved on 4–20% Tris glycine gels (Nusep) and
transferred to Immobilon PVDF membranes in transfer buffer overnight at 4°C. Membranes
were blocked for 1 hour in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST), then
incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk in TBST: (1:5000 for
anti-MBP (Covance), anti-CNP (Covance) and anti-Actin (Millipore); 1:1000 for anti-PLP
(Abcam); 1:1000 for anti-HB-EGF (Santa Cruz); 1:1000 for anti-Delta1 (Santa Cruz);
1:1000 for anti-NICD (Iowa Hybridoma Bank C17.9C6); and 1:4,000 for antiAspartoacylase (ThermoScientific)). The membranes were then washed in TBST three times
for 10–15 min at room temperature followed by the addition of either horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) for polyclonal primary
antibodies, or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Santa Cruz) for mouse
monoclonal primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk in TBST. For phosphorylated EGFR
(Novus Biologicals), 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST was used as block and for
primary antibody incubation overnight. For all Western blots, chemiluminescent signals
were detected using Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate. X-ray films were scanned using
an Agfa T1200 scanner and densitometric measurements were obtained using ImageJ
software. Western blots were obtained from WM of 3–6 male mice in each group.
Densitometric measurements were obtained using ImageJ software averaged as previously
described29,36,38.

WM was grossly dissected on ice-cold 1x PBS from P11, P15 and P18 Rep and Rep-hEGFR
Nx and Hyp mice as described above. Assay procedure was performed according to
manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, Mouse EGF Quantikine ELISA Kit).
Experiments were performed in triplicates and averaged.
Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting [FACS]
WM microdissected tissue from Hyp P15 Rep+ (CNP-EGFP+) vehicle or HB-EGF treated

(BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). The collected Rep+ cells were used for Western blot
analysis.
Electron microscopy

Author Manuscript

Mice at P30 and P60 were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 10% picric acid
and 5% glutaraldehyde and postfixed for 2 weeks48. Brains were sectioned and prepared in
groups at the same time as previously described38,48. Sagittal sections of white matter were
examined with a JEOL transmission electron microscope (JEM-1400), and pictures were
taken with a Gatan SC1000 ORIUS CCD camera. Measurements and image processing was
performed using ImageJ (US National Institute of Health). Myelin thickness was calculated
from the average of radial measurements at four points per sheath, avoiding areas of tongue
processes or fixation artifact48,49. Axon diameters were calculated from measurement of the
axon circumference. Axons with diameters typical of unmyelinated fibers (<0.3 μm) were
excluded from analysis48,49. The extent of myelination was quantitatively compared by
determining g-ratios, which were calculated by dividing the diameter of the axon by the
diameter of the entire myelinated fiber, as previously described48–50. Measurements were
performed by J.S. who was blinded to groups. At least 100 axons were measured for each
brain.
LPC-induced demyelination

Author Manuscript

Bilateral demyelination was performed in adult male and female C57Bl/6 (8 weeks old)
mice after deep ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (10mg/gram body weight). Mice were placed
in a modified stereotaxic frame (Stoetling) and 2 μl of 2% lysolecithin (EMD Chemicals,
LPC) solution (vol/vol) and/or 0.9% NaCl (vol/vol) was injected bilaterally into the corpus
callosum using a Hamilton micropette (Stoetling). Injection time lasted for 5 min to reduce
reflux along needle track. The needle was then slowly withdrawn over a 5 min period.
Stereotaxic coordinates for corpus callosum were taken from bregma (0.26 mm caudal, 1.0
mm lateral and 3.0 mm ventral). Inclined beam-walking behavioral test testing began 5 days
after surgery in both groups of mice as described below. Bilateral demyelination was
confirmed after testing by perfusing the mice as described above and immunohistochemical
analysis of corpus callosum using anti-MBP. Only mice that displayed clear bilateral lesions
on microscopic examination were included in the behavioral analysis. Three (n=3) mice
were excluded from the study because bilateral WM demyelination was not clearly evident.
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Analysis (ex vivo)

Author Manuscript

Mice (P60) used for DTI were perfused and imaged as previously described51. One hour
prior to DTI scans the brains were soaked 3 times for 10 minutes each time in 10 mL PBS to
remove the PFA solution. The brains were placed into a custom built MRI compatible tube,
filled with Fluorinert - an MRI susceptibility-matching fluid (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis,
MO). The DTI datasets were obtained on a 9.4 T horizontal bore magnet (Bruker, Billerica,
MA, U.S.A.) with a custom-made 1H radio frequency coil. The DTI experiments were
performed using the Stejskal-Tanner spin-echo diffusion-weighted sequence with a diffusion
gradient of 5ms and a delay between the two diffusion gradients of 15ms. 24 contiguous
coronal slices of 0.5mm thickness were acquired using a repetition time (TR) of 2s and an
echo time (TE) of 25.1ms. Two Shinnar–Le Roux (SLR) pulses of 1ms each were used for

excitation and inversion, respectively. 20 averages were acquired for each slice and the 128
× 64 images were zero-filled to 256 × 256, resulting in an in-plane resolution of 100 μm ×
100 μm. Sixteen different images were acquired for each slice, fifteen corresponding to
various noncollinear diffusion weighting directions with the same b = 1000 s/mm2 and one
with no diffusion weighting. The DTI processing and analysis was performed blindly as
described previously51,52.
Compound Action Potential [CAPs]

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Compound action potential (CAP) recordings were performed in all 4 groups at P30 and P60
using methods previously described29,45. Briefly, following sacrifice, coronal slices 400 μm
in thickness were obtained using a VT1000S vibratome (Leica) in ice-cold slicing solution
(85 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 7 mM
MgCl2, 25 mM glucose, 75 mM sucrose). Slices were placed in recording solution (125 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2,
11 mM glucose, pH = 7.4) bubbled in 95% O2/5% CO2 and maintained at 37°C for 1 hour
then kept in the same solution at room temperature (22–25°C) until recording. CAP
recordings were performed on five slices corresponding to sections 13–18 (Bregma 1.32 to
−0.94 mm) of the National Institutes of Mental Health’s mouse brain atlas (http://
www.mbl,org/atlas170/atlas170_frame.html). Slices were placed in a recording chamber
superfused with oxygenated recording solution at a flow rate of 2 mL min−1 and viewed
using the 10x objective of an Olympus BX61WI microscope. CAP recordings were obtained
using a FHC concentric bipolar stimulating electrode and an extracellular field electrode
with a tip resistance of 1MΩ. The stimulating and recording electrodes were placed ~2 mm
apart (~1 mm on each side of the midline) in the corpus callosum of sub-cortical WM and a
constant stimulus was delivered for each recording in current clamp. A single pulse protocol
was used with a pulse frequency of 200 Hz and a period of 5 ms. Fifty sweeps were
recorded, averaged and used in analysis for CAP amplitude. Two distinguishable downward
waves were evident for each CAP recording, with the first corresponding to rapidly
propagating myelinated (M) axons and the second to slower propagating unmyelinated
(UM) axons29,45,53.

Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy [1H-NMR]

Author Manuscript

Brains from all groups were collected at P11, P18 and P30. The brains were removed and
placed on dry ice. The WM was dissected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (total time <60sec),
and stored in −80°C freezer until extraction. Samples for 1H-NMR spectroscopy were
prepared as previously published54. Each frozen sample was homogenized in 1ml of 7%
perchloric acid and centrifuged for 10min at 4°C and 7000rpm. Supernatants were
transferred to separate tubes and pellets were re-extracted. Combined supernatants were
neutralized with KOH, centrifuged and lyophilized. Lyophilized samples were dissolved in
0.8ml of 99% D2O and pH was adjusted to 7.0. Fully-relaxed 1H NMR spectra was acquired
on Varian 500 with the following parameters: 90° pulse angle, an acquisition time of
1.36sec, relaxation delay of 17sec, total number of 800 scans per sample. Low-power presaturation pulse at water frequency was used to achieve water suppression. Obtained spectra
was analyzed using MestReNova software (version 8.1; Mestrelab Research, Spain) and the
amounts of metabolites were quantified from integrals of the peak areas corrected for

Behavioral testing

Author Manuscript

Each behavioral experiment was performed in separate naïve mice that had not undergone
any previous behavioral testing. Complex running wheel task was performed as previously
described55–57. At P45, naïve mice that did not undergo any prior behavioral testing, were
individually housed in a modified cage equipped with a running wheel attached to an optical
sensor to constantly detect the number of wheel revolutions per time interval (minute).
Animals were kept on a regular 12-hour light/dark cycle. Food and water were made
available ad lib. During the first 2 weeks, a training wheel with all 38 rungs was present
allowing for normalization of running behavior. On the third week (day 15; age P60), the
regular training wheel was replaced with a complex wheel of the same diameter with 22
rungs missing in an alternative pattern. Using the Activity Wheel Monitoring Software
(Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, IN), wheel revolutions were recorded each day and
exported to a Microsoft Excel file in which daily total distance traveled and maximum daily
velocity were calculated. All mice showed spontaneous running behavior and no mice were
excluded from this study. Inclined beam-walking task was performed as previously
described58,59. Two elevated 80 cm in length wooden beams were placed at a 30-degree
angle. One beam was 2cm in width and the other 1cm in width. A dark box with bedding
was at the end of the incline and served as target for the mouse to reach. A blinded
experimenter observing and recording from above assessed mice performance by
documenting the number of foot slips (either hind legs or front legs) and the time to traverse
the beam58. In pilot studies, we determined that Hyp Rep mice less than 30 days of age - or
on a beam that was inclined more than 30 degrees - were unable to perform this task (data
not shown). To confirm whether this sensori-motor task is dependent on subcortical WM,
bilateral LPC or 0.9% saline injected adult mice were tested on day 5 after surgery
(described above). Bilateral demyelination was confirmed after testing by removal of brains
and immunohistochemical analysis of corpus callosum. Only mice that displayed clear
bilateral lesions on microscopic examination were included in the behavioral analysis (n=3
mice were excluded due to failure in demyelination).

Statistics

Author Manuscript

All data in histograms are presented as averages ± s.e.m. All cell counting and Western blot
data were statistically compared using One way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to
determine whether overall differences exist across study groups. Comparisons between
specific groups were treated as unplanned comparisons, which were adjusted using a
Bonferroni correction. A two-tailed type I error (p value < 0.05) was used to determine
statistical significance. Each experiment evaluated outcomes in 4 groups. The Bonferroni
correction was applied for the following comparisons: Nxa vs Nxb; Nxa vs Hypa; and Nxb vs
Hypb. The 2 Hyp groups were compared post hoc if the one way ANOVA was significant
using a two-tailed unpaired t-test (Hypa vs Hypb) with two-tailed type 1 error set at p=0.05.
For the EM data, a one-way ANOVA was used to compare the g-ratio for each mice in each
of the 4 respective groups. If significance was found, then a two-tailed unpaired t-test with
two-tailed type I error set at p=0.05 was used to make the following comparisons: Nxa vs

Hypa; Hypa vs Hypb; Nxa vs Nxb; and Nxb vs Hypb. Scatter plots of g-ratios of individual
fibers in relation to axon diameter are shown comparing the groups outlined above. The
average FA anisotropy for each mouse in each group was compared using a one-way
ANOVA as described above. The Bonferroni correction was applied for the following
comparisons: Nx Saline vs Hyp Saline; Nx Saline vs Hyp HB-EGF; and Hyp Saline vs Hyp
HB-EGF. For the complex running wheel data, we used a longitudinal linear regression
analysis to compare slopes (trajectories) of change. We also performed post hoc testing
between the four groups for each individual day. For the beam walking behavioral results,
the number of foot slips, the time to traverse the beam and the size of the beam was analyzed
using a Poisson multiple regression analysis, which allowed us to overcome the lack of
normality in count type data and account for other variables to compare the rate of foot slips.
The one-way ANOVA with post hoc comparisons was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0
(for Mac; La Jolla, CA). All histograms and scatter plots in this manuscript were created
with GraphPad Prism.

The WM was dissected out at P11, 15 and 18 in normoxia (Nx) and Hyp CNP-EGFP (Rep)
and CNP-EGFP-hEGFR (Rep-hEGFR) mice. At P11, in both Hyp groups, there was a
significant increase in EGF levels, as measured by ELISA. There was no significant
difference between the two Hyp groups, indicating that overexpression of EGFR in
oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells does not modify endogenous EGF levels. At P15 and

Extended Data Figure 3. The inclined beam-walking task requires normal subcortical white
matter

Author Manuscript

This study was performed to test the hypothesis that the inclined beam-walking task is a
good assessment of subcortical WM function. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed
a well-established model of subcortical WM demyelination induced by bilateral lysolecithin
injections in 8-week-old C57Bl/6J male and female mice. Animals were tested at 5 days
post-surgical intervention - which is a time period when demyelination is at its maximum to determine whether subcortical WM integrity is important in this behavioral task. Control
mice received bilateral injections of normal saline using the same coordinates as the
lysolecithin group. a–b, Bilateral demyelination was confirmed after testing by removal of
brains and immunohistochemical analysis of corpus callosum. Only mice that displayed
clear bilateral lesions on microscopic examination were included in the behavioral analysis

very significant increase in average number of foot slips on 2-and-1cm wide inclined beam,
respectively (2-tailed Mann Whitney test, n=6 per group). d, We wanted to determine
whether the Rep (CNP-EGFP) transgenic mice performance on the inclined beam-walking
task was similar to C57Bl/6 mice (wild-type). No difference in performance was evident
between the 2 different lines of male mice. We found that the Rep and wild type mice
performed similarly in either Nx or Hyp conditions (Poisson multiple regression analysis,
Nx Rep n=7, Nx wild-type n=11, Hyp Rep n=8, Hyp wild-type n=11). All histograms are
