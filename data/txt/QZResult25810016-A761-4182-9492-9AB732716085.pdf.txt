ABSTRACT
Development of anti-cancer drugs towards clinical application is costly and
inefficient. Large screens of drugs, efficacious for non-cancer disease, are currently
being used to identify candidates for repurposing based on their anti-cancer properties.
Here, we show that low-dose salinomycin, a coccidiostat ionophore previously
identified in a breast cancer screen, has anti-leukemic efficacy. AML and MLLr cell
lines, primary cells and patient samples were sensitive to submicromolar salinomycin.
Most strikingly, colony formation of normal hematopoietic cells was unaffected by
salinomycin, demonstrating a lack of hemotoxicity at the effective concentrations.
Furthermore, salinomycin treatment of primary cells resulted in loss of leukemia
repopulation ability following transplantation, as demonstrated by extended recipient
survival compared to controls. Bioinformatic analysis of a 17-gene signature identified
and validated in primary MLLr cells, uncovered immunomodulatory pathways, hubs
and protein interactions as potential transducers of low dose salinomycin treatment.
Additionally, increased protein expression of p62/Sqstm1, encoded for by one of
the 17 signature genes, demonstrates a role for salinomycin in aggresome/vesicle
formation indicative of an autophagic response.
Together, the data support the efficacy of salinomycin as an anti-leukemic at
non-hemotoxic concentrations. Further investigation alone or in combination with
other therapies is warranted for future clinical trial.

Salinomycin is a polyether organic anion that is
widely used as a coccidiostatic antibiotic in poultry and
ruminant feed. Salinomycin was identified in a chemical
screen by Gupta et al to target breast cancer stem cells
(CSCs) [7], and has subsequently shown anti-neoplastic
properties in a range of human cancers, including
hematological malignancies (reviewed by Zhou et al) [8],
though it’s activity in acute leukemia remains unexplored.
We previously used Connectivity Mapping to identify
candidate drugs, including an antibiotic, for repurposing
as anti-leukemic agents [9].
As an antibiotic, salinomycin primarily acts as an
ionophore, facilitating transportation of cations (e.g. Ca2+ and

INTRODUCTION
Drug repurposing (or repositioning) has become a
tactic to deploy approved weaponry in the war on cancer,
resulting in the development of defined projects [1]. The
concept of drug repurposing is borne from a demand to
complement and accelerate current drug development
strategies, which are often costly, inefficient, [2, 3] and
in the case of anti-cancer therapies, can take over 8 years
to obtain approval for clinical use [4]. This potential drug
development ‘crisis’ is occurring at the same time as
increased cancer incidence due in part to an aging society,
altered lifestyles and diet in developing countries [5, 6].

K+) across membranes resulting in toxic intracellular levels
[10, 11]. As an anti-cancer agent, salinomycin has been
reported to activate several pathways including apoptosis
in a p53/Caspase/CD95/DC95L/ proteasome independent
manner, increase DNA damage, and inhibit Wnt signalling,
preferentially in malignant CSCs [12–15]. However, the
precise mechanism of action of salinomycin in distinct
CSCs remains to be elucidated. One recognized limitation
for clinical application of salinomycin is a relatively narrow
therapeutic index, giving rise to potential related toxicities
[16–18] and potential impairment of normal stem cell
function, particularly within the hematopoietic system.
To gain further insight into possible clinical
application for hematological malignancies, we examined
and demonstrated the anti-leukemic potential of lowdose salinomycin in pre-clinical models of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and poor prognosis Mixed Lineage
Leukemia-rearranged (MLLr) subtypes, whilst concurrently
demonstrating negligible toxicity to normal blood cells.

2A and Supplementary Table S1). Increases in Sub G0
were associated with decreases in S-phase populations
(Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2 upper), and
increased Annexin V expression (Supplementary Figure
S2) was associated with limited change in Caspase
activity, restricted to 1 μM treatment of MV4;11 cells
(Supplementary Figure S1, lower panel). Microscopic
examination showed similar morphological changes as
observed for AML cells, including the presence of vesicles
in all MLLr cell lines following 500 nM salinomycin
treatments (Figure 2C). Overt vesicle formation in three
of the MLLr cell lines examined (MOLM-13, NOMO-1
and RS4;11) was observed even at 100 nM salinomycin
compared to vehicle controls, indicating increased
sensitivity in these cell lines.

Salinomycin-sensitive primary murine AML and
MLLr leukemia cell lines
To further examine the potential anti-leukemic
effect of salinomycin, studies were extended into two
growth factor-dependent primary murine cell lines
A9M and MAF9, generated by retroviral transduction
of HOXA9-ires-Meis1(A9M) or MLL-AF9 (MAF9) into
primary haematopoietic cells, as previously reported
[9], followed by serial replating in methylcellulose.
Due to anticipated increased sensitivity in the primary
cells, an extended lower dose range (10 - 500 nM) was
used. Both primary cell lines demonstrated reduced cell
viability at 250 nM and 500 nM salinomycin at both early
(24 hour) and late (72 hour) time points (Figure 3A).
Lower dose salinomycin (75 nM and 100 nM) resulted
in differential time and cell line response, with the MAF9
cells demonstrating greater sensitivity and lower estimated
IC50s (Supplementary Figure S3). The decreased cell
viability was matched with dramatic changes in cell cycle,
in particular increased Sub G0 and decreased S and G2M
populations at higher doses (Figure 3B). Consistent with
the cell viability assays, cell cycle responses were more
striking in MAF9 (lower panel) than A9M cells (upper
panel). Since higher doses of salinomycin resulted in
significant cell loss, cell morphology analysis in A9M
and MAF9 cells was restricted to lower concentrations
(75 nM and 100 nM) for up to 72 hours. Morphological
changes, including the presence of vesicles, were observed
for both cell lines in a time and dose-dependent manner.
Interestingly, MAF9 cells also demonstrated the presence
of band neutrophils at the 72 hour time point (75 nM),
indicative of differentiation (Figure 3C).

RESULTS
Differential sensitivity of human AML cell lines
to Salinomycin
AML cell lines demonstrated reduced cell viability
following salinomycin treatment (100 nM - 5 μM), with
OCI-AML3 cells demonstrating greatest and U937 cells
least sensitivity, particularly at the 24 hour time point
(Figure 1A and Supplementary Table S1). Reduced cell
viability was associated with an accumulation of cells in the
Sub G0 phase of the cell cycle as determined by direct DNA
staining (Figure 1B) with only limited related changes in
Caspase activity (Supplementary Figure S1, upper panel).
Although U937 cells demonstrated little increase in the Sub
G0 population, some alteration in cell cycle progression,
primarily reduction of cells in S-phase, was observed.
To further examine the effects of salinomycin, AML
cells were exposed to low concentrations (≤1 μM) for 48
hours and examined microscopically. Three of the cell
lines demonstrated significant alterations in morphology
in a dose-dependent manner, ranging from loss of nuclear
shape at low dose exposure (100 nM, HL60) to the
formation of cytoplasmic vesicles at higher dosages (500
nM, OCI-AML3, HL60 and NB4). Consistent with the cell
viability and cell cycle assays, U937 cells demonstrated
no morphological changes compared to DMSO controls
(Figure 1C).

significance in the form of B-statistic (log-odds) or
negative log10(Adjusted P-value) versus log2 expression
(fold change) for each gene. Ultimately, only genes with
−log10(Adjusted P-value) > 2 and log2(fold change) > 0.5
were considered (Figure 4A). All samples and transcripts
induced or repressed at log2 (fold change) of 0.5 or more
(P ≤ 0.05) were subjected to hierarchical agglomerative
clustering by treatment with salinomycin (Figure 4B,
left panel). Clustering was based on a Euclidean distance
and complete linkage as distance and linkage methods.
Transcripts induced or repressed at log2(fold change) of
0.5 or more (P ≤ 0.01) were sorted in ascending order by
adjusted P-value. Twenty one probes, representing 18
genes, were identified for further evaluation (Figure 4B,
right panel, Supplementary Table S3).
Col4a1 was excluded due to insufficient expression
(CT > 35) and the remaining 17 genes were validated
with high correlation (r2 = 0.901) to the array outputs
for MAF9 (Supplementary Figure S4). All 17 genes
were significantly differentially expressed (P < 0.05)
in the MAF9 cells compared to control (Figure 4C)
with lactotransferrin being the only gene with reduced
expression following salinomycin treatment. qRT-PCR
analysis of the salinomycin 17-gene signature was
extended to A9M cells and over 50% (9/17) of the genes
demonstrated differential expression to a significance level
(P < 0.05).
The salinomycin 17-gene signature was further used
to interrogate bioinformatic databases. Submission of the
gene signature to GeneMania [19], a large associationbased database, identified functional networks, including
positive regulation of immune response and protein
serine/threonine kinase activity, based primarily on coexpression with FDR values < 10-5 (Supplementary Figure
S5). Submission of the translated 17-gene signature to
the protein-protein interaction network STRING [20]
identified three primary hubs (NF-kB, chemokine and
DNA repair) centrally connected by Tnf, Mapk14 and
Akt1 (Supplementary Figure S6A). Application of the
signature to DAVID (The Database for Annotation,
Visualization and Integrated Discovery) [21, 22] analysis
identified the toll-like pathway (KEGG) with significance
(P = 0.0063 corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method;
Supplementary Figure S6B). Together, these analyses
identified association of salinomycin treatment with
primary immunomodulatory pathways.

induced structures (ALIS), which resemble the vesicles
observed in the salinomycin-treated leukemic cell lines
(Figures 1C, 2C and 3C). To examine this further, human
MLLr and both primary cell lines were treated with
salinomycin and probed for expression of Sqstm1/p62.
Treated cells showed cytoplasmic restricted Sqstm1/p62
positivity, by co-immunofluorescence and DAPI staining,
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5). Quantitative
scoring demonstrated a marked increase in the proportion
of salinomycin treated Sqstm1/p62 positive cells
compared to vehicle control (Supplementary Figure S7)
associated with modest increased expression of Atg7 and
Beclin-1, particularly in the more sensitive MAF9 cells,
as determined by western blot analysis (Supplementary
Figure S8). Together, these data indicate activation of an
autophagic response by AML/MLLr cells to low-dose
salinomycin treatment.

Anti-leukemic effects of salinomycin in
primary cells
Primary mouse models and patient samples
were next used to examine the anti-leukemic activity
of salinomycin. Normal bone marrow (mouse) and
donor derived mobilized peripheral blood (human)
cells served as controls to examine potential toxicity to
normal hematopoietic cells. As for the generated mouse
cell lines, a range of low dose salinomycin (10 nM to
500 nM) was used to treat the corresponding primary
leukemia cells (A9Mp and MAF9p, respectively).
Myeloid colony formation for both primary leukemias
was impaired in a dose dependent manner compared to
controls (Figure 6A). To examine effects on leukemia
maintenance, vehicle control or salinomycin treated
primary leukemias were transplanted into recipient
mice. Extension in survival was observed for both the
early onset A9Mp (P = 0.0027) and late onset MAF9p
cells (P = 0.002) treated with 500 nM salinomycin
compared to controls (Figure 6B). The short extension
in survival (~ 6 days) for the more aggressive A9M
compared to the more sensitive MAF9 leukemias may
reflect differences in cell of origin or repopulating cell
numbers. Transplantation of salinomycin treated normal
bone marrow cells had no deleterious effect on recipient
mice within the time of evaluation (data not shown).
Colony formation of mouse normal bone marrow (NBM)
or normal mobilized peripheral blood (NMPB) was not
markedly affected by salinomycin treatment (even at 500
nM), whereas the ability to form colonies was impaired
by 100 nM and inhibited by 500 nM salinomycin
treatment in both human (hAML1-3) and mouse (A9Mp,
MAF9p) primary leukemias (Figure 6C). Interestingly,
both mouse and patient derived leukemia cells appear
to retain metabolic activity (as seen by incorporation of
the INT stain) but the ability to form small clusters or
colonies is impaired.

Induction of sequestosome-1(p62) positive
aggresomes/vesicles
Five of the genes identified as part of the
salinomycin-induced signature in MAF9 cells,
including sequestosome-1 (Sqstm1/p62), were highly
significantly upregulated (P < 0.001) compared to control
(Supplementary Table S3). Sqstm1 is associated with the
formation of polyubiquitin-containing aggresome-like

DISCUSSION

signature, subsequently analyzed in the murine AML
cells. Two of the genes verified in both primary cell lines,
Klf6 and Ddit3, are markers of oxidative stress recently
reported as upregulated by salinomycin in prostate cancer
cells [26]. An additional gene identified, p62/Sqstm1, is
required for aggresome formation linked to degradation of
ubiquitinated proteins by autophagy [27]. Further analysis
confirmed increased SQSTM1-positive aggresome
formation and increased expression of Atg7 and Beclin-1
in salinomycin treated leukemic cells. Salinomycin
has been reported to induce autophagy in other cancers
[28–30]. However, whether this response is cancer cell
protective or destructive requires further investigation.
SQSTM1 was recently shown to shuttle polyubiquitinated
proteins to nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies [31],
and a specific role in this context may warrant further
examination.
Submission of the gene signature to online
bioinformatics databases identified several pathways
and network hubs including: positive regulation of
immune response and serine/threonine kinase activity
(GeneMania); NF-kB, DNA-damage and chemokine
hubs (STRING) and the Toll-like receptor pathway
(DAVID). Together these analyses indicate activation
of an immunomodulatory response by salinomycin
treatment. Immunomodulation is well established as

Novel approaches to drug discovery for
hematological malignancies are essential to take advantage
of advances made in molecular classification over the
last decade. Drug repurposing represents an attractive
and economical option in which a novel application for
an existing drug is indicated e.g. Metformin, the antitype 2 diabetes mellitus drug, was recently found to
have anti-neoplastic effects in several tissues including
gynecological cancers [23]. Salinomycin is a polyether
antibiotic with promising anti-cancer properties [7, 8, 12,
15], albeit at the micromole level with associated potential
toxicities [24, 25]. A specific study on its potential clinical
use in the acute leukemia context has not been reported.
Here, we investigated the anti-leukemic effects
of low dose (sub-micromole) salinomycin in human
and murine pre-clinical models, of AML and MLLr,
including primary leukemia cells. Low dose salinomycin
treatment resulted in reduced cell viability, increased
apoptosis, vesicle formation and differentiation. A greater
sensitivity was observed throughout for MLLr cells. The
time and dose-dependent manner of the salinomycin
effects indicated a biological response. Gene expression
profiling and validation of the most sensitive murine
MLLr cells revealed a salinomycin induced 17-gene

both a cellular and molecular therapy in hematological
malignancies, including leukemia [32–34]. Specifically,
activation of Toll-like receptor pathways promotes
differentiation and growth inhibition in AML [35] and
demonstrates efficacy in combination with anti-multiple
myeloma agents including bortezomib, lenalidomide,
melphalan or vorinostat [36]. Activation of an immune
response may also reflect inherent inhibition of these
pathways in MLLr and HOXA9-Meis-induced malignant
cells, as recently reported for MN1 [37], and highlight a
potential therapeutic role for salinomycin in these specific
leukemias. The specific loss of colony formation of
primary leukemia cells and associated loss of repopulating
ability in vivo supports the reactivation of differentiation
pathways by low dose salinomycin treatment. The fact
that cells remain metabolically active yet incapable of
forming colonies may also reflect subtle differences in
mitochondrial and biosynthesis requirements for AML
cells that are susceptible to antibiotics and can be exploited
[37–42].
Indeed, association with chemotherapy [43] or
combination with experimental therapies, including
histone deacetylase inhibitors, in the form of anticancer
kits that exploit cytotoxic and neo-protection [44], as
recently reported for solid tumours [45, 46], may provide
the best method to exploit the observed anti-leukemic
effects of salinomycin.
Together, the data demonstrates efficacy of non-toxic
low dose salinomycin treatment against poor prognostic
MLLr and AML and provides insights into the underlying
molecular mechanisms. Further investigation of the
mechanism and in vivo use of low dose salinomycin as a
monotherapy or in combination with either chemotherapy
or epigenetic modifiers is warranted, to provide the basis
for future clinical application.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability, cell cycle and morphology

Human cell lines, murine primary cell lines and
leukemias and patient samples

Human and murine cell lines were treated for up to
72 hours in RPMI-10 or RPMI-10+ respectively containing
either salinomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK)
at the stated concentration or 0.01% DMSO as vehicle
control. Cell viability was determined by CellTiter-Glo®
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For cell cycle analysis,
samples were fixed in 70% ethanol and DNA stained by
Propidium Iodide (Sigma-Aldrich). DNA content was
measured with an LSR II flow cytometer and analyzed
using FACS DivaTM (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA) or Cyflogic software (CyFlo Ltd, Turku,
Finland). Cells were pelleted, re-suspended in 200 μl
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), cytospun (28 x g) for
5 minutes (Cytospin3, Thermo Shandon, Runcorn, UK)
and stained with Modified Wright’s stain, for morphology
analysis.

effectively constitute log2 fold changes in expression of
genes of interest in treated samples compared to control.

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol® (Life
Technologies), and its quality was assessed using Agilent
RNA 6000 Nano chip and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity (RIN) values
of >9 were obtained for all samples prior to application
to the Mouse Ref-8 expression v.2 BeadArray (Illumina,
San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 550 ng of each RNA sample was
reverse transcribed then in vitro transcribed to generate
biotinylated cRNAs. Aliquots of labelled cRNAs (750 ng)
were then hybridized to the BeadArray for 16-18 hours
at 58°C. Signal detection was achieved using Amersham
fluorolink streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences,
Little Chalfont, UK) and scanned images obtained using
the Illumina BeadArray confocal scanner. Bead level data
of biological triplicates were transformed to log2 scale,
normalized (quantile method) using beadarray R package
[49] and annotated (Gene Symbols, Names, Entrez IDs,
and Probe Quality Grades) using illuminaMousev2.db
R package [50]. Probes with poor quality grades were
removed. Differential expression was then assessed
by linear regression followed by parametric empirical
Bayes analysis using limma R package [51] and output
obtained by plotting significance versus log2 expression
(fold change). Genes with expression ratios above
log2(0.5)-fold between treatments and control (P < 0.05
and P < 0.01) were identified. False discovery rates
(FDR) were controlled using the Benjamini-Hochberg
algorithm. Hierarchical clustering with complete linkage
and Euclidean distance, as a measure of similarity, was
performed.

Immunofluorescence
Treated and control cells were collected by
centrifugation (107 x g), re-suspended in PBS, and 1 x
105 cells cytospun (28 x g) onto glass slides (Cytospin3,
Thermo Shandon Ltd., Runcorn, UK). Cells were fixed
in 4% Paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes,
washed (x 2) in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/
PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes, then incubated in 3%
Bovine Serum Albumin Fraction V (BSA; Sigma Aldrich)
for 30 minutes, all at room temperature. SQSTM1/p62
Alexa Fluor monoclonal antibody (Clone 864807; R&D
Systems, Abingdon, UK) was diluted 1:10 in 3% BSA/
PBS, as per the manufacturer’s instructions, and slides
were incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber.
Following primary antibody labelling, slides were washed
(x3) in PBS, air-dried, and mounting medium containing
4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) applied prior to
coverslip application. Slides were stored at 4°C prior to
image capture using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (x60
objective) (Nikon, Surrey, UK).

Salinomycin treatment of primary leukemias
Fresh primary murine leukemia or rapidly thawed
primary AML patient bone marrow and mobilized
peripheral blood samples were allowed to recover in
RPMI-10+ or RPMI-10 respectively. Primary cells were
treated with salinomycin or DMSO for 16 hours in
liquid culture then plated in methylcellulose. Similarly
treated human cells were seeded at 1 x 105/ml in
MethoCult™ H4434 Classic (Stem Cell Technologies)
and treated mouse leukemias were either seeded at 5 x
105/ml in MethoCult™ GF M3434 medium (Stem Cell
Technologies) or directly transplanted (5 x 105 cells) into
sub-lethally irradiated (850 cGy) recipient mice. Recipient
mice were followed for up to 80 days, or disease endpoint,
at which point necropsy was performed.

qRT-PCR validation of beadarray data
Total RNA isolated from salinomycin or vehicle
treated MAF9 and A9M cells was converted to cDNA
[9]. Expression of 18 candidate genes with Peptidylprolyl
isomerase A 1 (Ppia1) as endogenous control was
quantified using technical duplicates of biological
replicates (n=4). Genes and corresponding primers are
listed (Supplementary Table S4). Assays were performed
with FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix
(Roche) on the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast RealTime PCR System using Sequence Detection System
(SDS v2.3) software as per manufacturers’ protocols.
Technical duplicates with standard deviations <0.6
CT were averaged, else a single value closest to other
biological replicates was used.
Data were processed as reported previously [52].
Briefly, mean ΔCT values and standard errors calculated
for each control and treatment group were normalized
to yield −ΔΔCT (=ΔCTcontrol −ΔCTtreatment) values, which

Methylcellulose assays, staining and imaging
Methylcellulose cultures were maintained at 37°C
with 5% CO2 for up to 10 days when colony formation,
colony counts, and images were captured and analyzed.
Colony staining with 1 mg/ml p-iodonitrotetrazolium
violet (INT, Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) for 16 hours
enabled visualization of colonies and metabolic activity.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-tests were performed using GraphPad
Prism software v5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,

USA). Sample sizes of similar variance (n ≥ 3 for cell
lines and n ≥ 5 for animal studies) were selected based on
previous experience to provide sufficient statistical power.
Means ± SEM were plotted and significance denoted by
