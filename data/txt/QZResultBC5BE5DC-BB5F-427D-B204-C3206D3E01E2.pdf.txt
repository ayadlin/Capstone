Abstract
Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is an important cytokine for
monocyte/macrophage lineage. Secretory M-CSF (sM-CSF) and membrane-bound
M-CSF (mM-CSF) are two major alternative splicing isoforms. The functional diversity
of these isoforms in the activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs),
especially in lymphoma microenvironment, has not been documented. Here, we
studied the effects of M-CSF isoforms on TAMs in xenograft mouse model. More
infiltrating TAMs were detected in microenvironment with mM-CSF and sM-CSF. TAMs
could be divided into three subpopulations based on their expression of CD206 and
Ly6C. While sM-CSF had greater potential to recruit and induce differentiation of
TAMs and TAM subpopulations, mM-CSF had greater potential to induce proliferation
of TAMs and TAM subpopulations. Though both isoforms educated TAMs and TAM
subpopulations to M2-like macrophages, mM-CSF and sM-CSF induced different
spectrums of phenotype-associated genes in TAMs and TAM subpopulations. These
results suggested the diverse effects of M-CSF isoforms on the activation of TAMs and
TAM subpopulations in lymphoma microenvironments.

Introduction

M-CSF function in M-CSF-deficient mice [6] and mMCSF was more effective to accumulate and activate
macrophages in renal inflammation kidney [7]. mM-CSF
and PG-M-CSF each shifted the circulating monocyte
population toward an inflammatory, activated phenotype
more readily recruited to the kidney during lupus nephritis
[8].
M-CSF takes part in the pathological process of
tumors. High level of M-CSF was detected in breast
cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial carcinoma, and
cervical cancer [9, 10]. Furthermore, high sM-CSF level
was associated with poor prognosis in colorectal and
breast cancers [11, 12]. Abnormal high serum M-CSF
level was also reported in pre-leukemia, leukemia,
lymphoid malignancies [13] and high level of membrane
associated M-CSF was reported in Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) [14].
Macrophages are essential cellular components
of the host defense system and play important roles

Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF),
also known as colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), is the
key regulator for monocyte / macrophage lineage [1]. By
alternative splicing from a single gene, three biologically
active isoforms, i.e. secretory (sM-CSF), membranebound (mM-CSF) and extracellular matrix or proteoglycan
(PG-M-CSF), have been identified [2]. They bind the
same receptor, M-CSFR. PG-M-CSF was suggested as
an extracellular matrix storage form of sM-CSF [3]. sMCSF regulates cells nearby or in distance by autocrine,
paracrine or endocrine mechanisms, whereas mM-CSF
regulates physically contact cells by juxtacrine mechanism
[4]. Though cleavage is inefficient, mM-CSF can also be
cleaved from cell membrane by TNFα converting enzyme
[5]. M-CSF isoforms show distinct characteristics in both
physiological and pathological processes. For example,

in both physiological and pathological processes [15].
They have remarkable plasticity, and their functional
phenotype is controlled by microenvironmental signals
[16-18]. Typically, macrophages can be polarized into
two functionally distinct forms representing two extreme
phenotypes, i.e. M1 and M2 macrophages. As important
components of the tumor microenvironments, tumorassociated macrophages (TAMs) promote the progression
of tumors in most cases by enhancing angiogenesis,
stimulating proliferation, migration and invasion of
tumor cells [19]. Though TAMs are regarded as M2
macrophages, they show diverse phenotypes different from
classical M2 phenotype in tumor microenvironments [16].
In facts, TAMs with both M1 and M2 characteristics were
detected in tumor tissues [20] though M2 macrophages are
suggested to have pro-tumor effects and M1 macrophages
are suggested to have anti-tumor effects [21]. Meanwhile,
subpopulations of TAMs were studied to reveal the nature
of macrophages in the development of tumors [22-24].
The significance of macrophages in hematopoietic
malignancies is mainly discussed in lymphomas.
Lymphoma-associated macrophages were proposed in
follicular lymphoma, and suggested to be an independent
predictor of overall survival [25, 26]. High TAM counts
in lymph node biopsy samples were detected in patients
with poor-prognostic classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma [27]
and different groups further discussed the potential use of
TAMs as a biomarker for risk stratification in Hodgkin’s
lymphoma [28-30]. We previously demonstrated that
mM-CSF could be a special linker between macrophage
and lymphoma cells [31]. However, the effects of M-CSF

isoforms in lymphoma microenvironment on macrophages
have not been elucidated.
In this study, we studied the characteristics of
TAMs in microenvironment with mM-CSF or sM-CSF in
a xenograft mice model. We found that TAMs could be
divided into three subpopulations based on the expression
of CD206 and Ly6C. While mM-CSF was more potent
to induce proliferation, sM-CSF was more potent to
recruit and induce differentiation of TAMs and TAM
subpopulations. Furthermore, mM-CSF and sM-CSF
induced different spectrums of phenotype-associated
genes though both isoforms educated TAMs to M2-like
macrophages phenotypes.

Results
Establishment of Namalwa cell lines stably
expressing sM-CSF and mM-CSF
To investigate the effects of M-CSF isoforms in
tumor microenvironment on macrophages, Namalwa
cells, which lack endogenous M-CSF expression, were
infected with blank MSCV-GFP retrovirus, retrovirus
carrying sM-CSF or mM-CSF. After cell sorting, stably
transfected cell lines were named Namalwa-V, Namalwa-S
and Namalwa-M, respectively. M-CSF expression was
verified by RT-PCR (Figure 1A), flow cytometry (Figure
1B), and confocal microscopy (Figure 1C).

Distribution of TAMs in xenograft mouse model

CSF on the proliferation of TAMs in tumor tissues.
51.4±6.5 % Ki67+ TAM-M were detected, whereas only
28.6±3.4% Ki67+ TAM-V and 28.0±7.5% Ki67+ TAM-S
were detected, respectively (Figure 2E). For BrdU
incorporation experiment, similar results were observed
(Figure 2F). These results indicated that the proliferation
potential of TAM-M was significantly higher than that
of TAM-V or TAM-S, suggesting that mM-CSF in
tumor microenvironment had greater potential to induce
proliferation of TAMs.

NOD/SCID mice were subcutaneously implanted
with equal number of Namalwa-V, Namalwa-M
or Namalwa-S cells. Mice were sacrificed on day
30~35, when the tumor volume was about 1 cm3. Flow
cytometry analysis showed that the average of infiltrating
macrophages was about 0.63% and 0.67%, respectively,
in Namalwa-M and Namalwa-S formed tumor tissues
(TAM-M and TAM-S, respectively), whereas it was about
0.12% in Namalwa-V formed tumor tissues (TAM-V)
(Figure 2A, 2B). This observation was further verified
by confocal microscopy analysis (Figure 2C, 2D). These
results demonstrated that more TAMs were found in tumor
microenvironment with mM-CSF or sM-CSF.

Activation phenotype of TAMs
Macrophages have remarkable plasticity, and their
functional phenotype is controlled by microenvironmental
signals. In vitro studies suggested that M-CSF induced
monocytes to M2 phenotype macrophages [32]. Here
we studied the polarization of macrophages in different
microenvironments by analyzing expression of 15
phenotype-associated genes by real time PCR. Compared
with TAM-V, TAM-M or TAM-S expressed lower level

of most M1-related genes including iNOS, IL-1β, IL-12
and IL-6. In contrast, they expressed higher level of most
M2-related genes including Arg1, CCL22, CD206, IL10, M-CSF, MMP9, and VEGFα (Figure 3A). Moreover,
TAM-M and TAM-S showed different spectrums.
Significant higher expression of CXCL11, CXCL9, Arg1
and M-CSF was detected in TAM-M, whereas higher
expression of IL-12, CCL17, CCL22, IL-10, MMP9 and
VEGFα was detected in TAM-S. These data suggested
that mM-CSF and sM-CSF had different effects to educate
TAMs to M2 phenotypes in vivo.
To analyze the systemic effects induced by different
Namalwa cells, we also analyzed the expression of the
above genes in peritoneal and bone marrow macrophages

in the same model (Figure S1). Compared to control group,
in bone marrow, macrophages expressed lower level of
all M2-related genes. In peritoneal cavity, macrophages
expressed lower level of most M2-related genes except
Arg1 and CD206. These results indicated that the systemic
effects of M-CSF isoforms on peritoneal and bone marrow
macrophages were totally different from that on TAMs in
tumor microenvironment.
It was reported that macrophage polarization was
determined by specific transcription factors. STAT1 is an
essential mediator of M1 macrophage polarization, while
STAT6 is required to drive M2 macrophage activation
[33]. To further investigate the mechanism, total and
phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT6 in TAMs were studied

by Nanopro immunoassay. The results showed that
three TAMs expressed similar level of STAT1 (Figure
3D) while TAM-V expressed lower level of STAT6
(Figure 3B). Furthermore, pSTAT6 was detected in all
three TAMs though it was lower in TAM-S (Figure 3B),
whereas pSTAT1 was detected in only TAM-V (Figure
3D). Moreover, though lower value of both pSTAT1/
STAT1 (Figure 3E) and pSTAT6/STAT6 (Figure 3C) was
detected in TAM-M and TAM-S, more drastic decrease
was observed in pSTAT1/STAT1 in TAM-M and TAM-S
compared to that in TAM-V. Unphosphorylated STATs
can also participate in cell signaling [34]. The above
results suggested that mM-CSF and sM-CSF in tumor
microenvironment polarized TAMs to M2 phenotype by
transcriptional regulation.

gene expression in TAMs in response to LPS or IL-4
stimulation when untreated TAMs in different groups
were set as controls, respectively. Upon LPS stimulation,
drastic response was observed in TAM-V, as much higher
fold increase was observed in the expression of IL-12,
IL-6, TNFα, CCL22, and IL-10 than TAM-M or TAM-S,
while decrease in the expression of Arg1 and M-CSF was
detected in TAM-V, which was not observed in TAM-M
or TAM-S (Figure 4A). The responses of TAM-M and
TAM-S were similar though higher fold increase of IL1β and TNFα could be observed in TAM-M. Upon IL-4
stimulation, high fold increase of Arg1 was observed in
all three TAMs though it was higher in TAM-V or TAM-S
than TAM-M. Furthermore, different responses could be
observed among three TAMs. Higher fold increase of IL-6
and VEGFα was detected in TAM-V; higher fold increase
of CCL17 was detected in both TAM-M and TAM-S;
higher fold increase of CCL22 was detected in TAM-M
whereas higher fold increase of IL-12 was detected in
TAM-S. These data suggested that the responses of
TAM-M and TAM-S to LPS or IL-4 showed differences
to TAM-V. Furthermore, the responses of TAM-M and
TAM-S had unique characteristics.
The data were also analyzed when the expression
of respective genes in untreated TAM-V was set as

Responses of TAMs to LPS and IL-4

further investigate the characteristics of TAMs in tumor
microenvironment with mM-CSF or sM-CSF, isolated
TAMs were stimulated with LPS or IL-4 for 24hrs
before real time PCR analysis of phenotype-associated
genes. Figure 4 showed the relative fold change of

microenvironments, the RQ value of gene expression in untreated TAM-V, TAM-M or TAM-S was designated 1.000, respectively. Data

control (Figure S2). After LPS stimulation, three TAMs
expressed similar level of most genes, except CXCL11,
iNOS, M-CSF and VEGFα, which were higher expressed
in TAM-M and TAM-S. In contrast, after IL-4 stimulation,
TAM-M and TAM-S expressed higher level of most genes
except IL-12 and M-CSF, which were similar in three
TAMs. These results suggested that TAMs educated by
mM-CSF and sM-CSF were more responsive to IL-4,
which polarized TAMs to classical M2 phenotype.

different biological characteristics [22, 36]. In this study,
we labeled TAMs with Ly6C, a surface marker for
recruited monocytes and macrophages, and CD206, a
surface marker for M2 macrophages. Three obvious TAMs
subpopulations were gated and termed gate I, gate II and
gate III TAMs (Figure 5A). The majority of TAM-V was
gate III TAMs, while the majority of TAM-M and TAM-S
was gate II TAMs (Figure 5B). Furthermore, gate I or gate
II TAMs in TAM-M and TAM-S were significantly more
than those in TAM-V while gate III TAMs in TAM-M
were more than those in either TAM-S or TAM-V (Figure
5C). Moreover, gate II and gate III TAMs in TAM-M
or TAM-S expressed higher level of F4/80 (Figure 5F),
indicating that they were more mature macrophages.

Subpopulations of TAMs
It has been reported that TAMs were heterogeneous
and could be further divided into subpopulations with

Interestingly, just gate II TAMs in TAM-M and TAM-S
expressed higher level of the differentiation specific
gene M-CSFR (Figure 5D). The typical morphology
of TAMs from different gates is shown in Figure 5G.
Drastic morphological distinction was observed among
TAM-V, TAM-M and TAM-S whereas less distinction was
detected among different gates. TAM-S from three gates
showed more mature morphology with large cell size and
abundant cytoplasm while TAM-M from gate II and gate
III were distinguished by their enlarged nucleoli. These
data suggested that both mM-CSF and sM-CSF in tumor
microenvironment promoted more mature phenotype of
TAMs while sM-CSF was more effective.

subpopulations was also analyzed when respective gene
expression (except IL-12 and CCL17) of gate I TAMs in
TAM-V was designated 1.000 (Figure 6B).

Discussion
M-CSF is a key regulator for the proliferation,
differentiation, activation and function of monocyte/
macrophage lineage [37]. Evidence showed that M-CSF
isoforms had both shared and unique functions [7, 8].
Until now, to our knowledge, little is known about the
diverse effects of M-CSF isoforms, specifically mMCSF and sM-CSF, on the recruitment, proliferation and
activation of TAMs though the effects of sM-CSF on
TAMs were reported [38]. In this study, we compared
the in vivo effects of mM-CSF and sM-CSF on TAMs to
explore functional diversity between these isoforms on
TAMs in a lymphoma xenograft mouse model.
High level sM-CSF in tumor tissues accounted for
the accumulation of TAMs and blockage of CSF1/CSFR
signal in tumors could significantly decreased TAMs
infiltration [39, 40]. We observed that more TAMs were
detected in tumor microenvironment with either mM-CSF
or sM-CSF. The rate of recruitment, proliferation and
apoptosis determines TAM counts in tumor tissues. sMCSF was reported to promote macrophage proliferation
in tumor microenvironment or in inflammation site [41,
42]. For the first time, we reported that mM-CSF more
potently stimulated the proliferation of TAMs than sMCSF. Furthermore, little difference could be detected
on the apoptosis between the two isoforms (6.3±4.6%
VS 5.4±3.9%, data not shown). Hence, sM-CSF is more
potent to recruit TAMs while mM-CSF is more potent to
stimulate the proliferation of TAMs. Interestingly, M-CSF
isoforms had different effects on the proliferation of TAM
subpopulations. Compared with TAM-V, little difference
was detected in gate I TAM-M and TAM-S; slight decrease
was detected in gate II TAM-M and TAM-S; whereas
significant increase was detected in gate III TAM-M and
TAM-S. Moreover, mM-CSF was more potent to stimulate
the proliferation of gate III TAMs than sM-CSF. It was
suggested that mM-CSF could provide stronger and more
persistent signals, which accounts for stronger effects of
mM-CSF on the proliferation of gate III TAMs, since the
membrane integrated mM-CSF hinders the internalization
and degradation process [43, 44].
M-CSF affects activation phenotype of
macrophages. But the mechanism(s) seem to be
complicated. Administration of sM-CSF in vitro induced
monocytes to M2 phenotype macrophages [18, 32].
However, conflicting results were obtained from in vivo
studies. Blocking CSF1/CSF1R signaling in mouse
pancreatic tumor model preferentially killed M2-like
CD206hi TAMs, whereas M1-like CD206lo TAMs were
much less affected [45]. However, in spontaneous
mammary tumor model, inhibition of CSF1R resulted

Proliferation of TAM subpopulations
The proliferation of TAM subpopulations was
studied by BrdU incorporation assay. The results showed
that gate I TAMs showed little difference among three
groups whereas more BrdU+ cells were detected in gate
II TAM-V than either TAM-M or TAM-S. It’s worth
noting that the majority of TAM-M and TAM-S was
gate II TAMs (Figure 5A, 5B), which suggested that the
increase of gate II TAM-M or TAM-S was mainly due to
recruitment rather than proliferation. Furthermore, more
BrdU+ cells were detected in gate III TAM-M and TAM-S
than TAM-V (Figure 5E), which suggested that M-CSF
mainly increased gate III TAMs and mM-CSF was more
potent than sM-CSF.

The phenotype of TAM subpopulations
To further study the characteristics of TAM
subpopulations, 104 cells were sorted each gate and
dynamic array analysis was performed. Figure 6A
plotted the relative expression levels of M1- and M2related genes in different subpopulations of TAM-M
and TAM-S, which were normalized to their respective
subpopulations of TAM-V. Compared with subpopulations
in TAM-V, TAM-M and TAM-S subpopulations had
common features, i.e. decreased expression of IL-1β, IL12 and CCL17 whereas increased expression of CXCL9,
CXCL11, Arg1, IL-10, CD206, uPA, CXCL4 and TGFβ,
which further confirmed the observation that tumor
microenvironment containing both M-CSF isoforms
educated TAMs to M2 phenotype. Furthermore, increased
expression of iNOS, VEGFα, MMP9 and CCL22 as well
as decreased expression of TNFα were detected in gate I
in both TAM-M and TAM-S, which were different from
the response of gate II and gate III TAMs. It’s worth
noting that IL-6 was increased significantly in all TAM-S
subpopulation, but decreased slightly in all TAM-M
subpopulation, which indicated that the two isoforms of
M-CSF in tumor microenvironment had different effects
on TAMs. The relative expression of these genes in three

in similar kinetics for depletion and recovery of both
M2-oriented MHC IIlo and M1-oriented MHC IIhi
TAMs [46]. In orthotopic pancreatic tumor model, two
CSF1R antagonists significantly deplete macrophages
expressing high levels of MHC II, but not MHC IIlo or
Tie+ TAMs [47]. From an overexpression model, we
found that M-CSF isoforms in tumor microenvironment
induced TAMs with more M2 phenotypes. Analysis of
transcription factors further confirmed the observation.

Nevertheless, TAM-M and TAM-S showed different
expression patterns of phenotype-associated genes and
different levels of pSTAT6. These observations suggested
that M-CSF isoforms in lymphoma microenvironment
polarized macrophages to different states with more M2
phenotypes.
An interesting observation of our results is that
TAMs in our model could further be divided into three
sub-populations based on the expression of CD206,

designated 1.000) and CCL17 (gate II TAMs in TAM-V was designated 1.000). Data in columns are shown as mean ± SD.

an M2 macrophage marker, and Ly6C, an important
marker for monocytes. Ly6C+ and Ly6C- monocytes are
regarded as “inflammatory” monocytes and “patrolling or
resident” monocytes, respectively [48]. Ly6C+ monocytes
differentiate into Ly6C+ inflammatory macrophages while
Ly6C- monocytes differentiate into Ly6C- macrophages
[33]. Ly6C+ macrophages could also differentiate into
Ly6C- macrophages in both tissue repairing model and
tumor [22, 49]. TAMs were supposed to be differentiated
from both Ly6C+ and Ly6C- recruited peripheral blood
monocytes [33] , but recent evidence suggested that
Ly6C+ monocytes might be the origin of TAMs [22,
50, 51]. In our model, more gate I and gate II TAMs
(Ly6C+ subpopulations) were detected while neither high
proliferation rates nor low apoptosis rate was detected
in both TAM-M and TAM-S. Furthermore, more gate
III TAMs (Ly6C- subpopulation) and high proliferation
rate were detected in TAM-M. These results imply that
both M-CSF isoforms are more potent to recruit Ly6C+
monocytes rather than Ly6C- monocytes.
M-CSF isoforms had different effects on phenotypes
of TAM subpopulations. Three subpopulations in TAM-S
showed more mature morphology with large cell size and
abundant cytoplasm despite of differential expressions of
F4/80, CD206, Ly6C and M-CSFR. Only gate I TAM-M
showed more mature morphology though the majority of
TAM-M was detected in gate II which expressed high level
of F4/80, CD206 and M-CSFR. Furthermore, analysis
of activation-related gene expression also demonstrated
that M-CSF isoforms also had different effects on TAM
subpopulations despite of similarities.
Taken together, TAMs could be divided into three
subpopulations based on the expression of CD206 and
Ly6C in a lymphoma xenograft model. More TAMs could
be detected in tumor microenvironment with M-CSF
isoforms. While mM-CSF had greater potential to induce
proliferation of TAMs and TAM subpopulations, sM-CSF
had greater potential to recruit and induce differentiation
of TAMs and TAM subpopulations. Though both M-CSF
isoforms educated TAMs and TAM subpopulations to
the states with more M2-like macrophage phenotypes,
mM-CSF and sM-CSF induced different spectrums
of activation-related genes in TAMs and TAM
subpopulations.

Namalwa-V, Namalwa-M or Namalwa-S, were sorted by
flow cytometry, respectively. All cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics (Hyclone, Logan,
UT) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. All
culture supplies were screened and selected on the basis of
being endotoxin free.

Antibodies against human M-CSF, mouse F4/80 were
from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); antibodies against mouse
STAT1 and pSTAT1 were from cell signaling technology

Xenograft mouse model
4- to 5-week old female NOD/SCID mice were
purchased from Center for Experimental Animals, the
Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and housed in the
sterile microisolators in the Animal Centre of the Institute
of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS &
PUMC. Experimental procedures performed on the mice
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
at the institutions involved in this study. After irradiated
by 137Cs with 250 cGy, mice were injected s.c. on the
dorsal side with 5×107 cells in a volume of 200μL. Mice
were sacrificed when the tumor volume was about 1cm3
(volume = length×width×width/2).

Preparation of tumor tissue samples
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and
tumor tissues were isolated by blunt dissection and grinded
into the Petri dish with PBS buffer with EDTA. Then cell
suspension was filtered through graded nylon filter and red
cells were removed using erythrocyte lysis buffer (8.26
g/L NH4Cl, 1 g/L KHCO3, and 0.037 g/LEDTA, pH 7.35).
After washing, enrichment of macrophages and labeling of
macrophage-associated antigens were performed. Briefly,
CD11b+ cells were enriched by anti-CD11b conjugated
magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA)
following manufacturer’s protocol. Then, enriched cells
were resuspended in PBS containing 1%FBS and stained
with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies. For sorting or
analysis of TAMs, cells were stained with APC-conjugated
anti mouse F4/80, whereas for sorting or analysis of TAM

FACS analysis and cell sorting

Real-time reverse transcription PCR

An LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) was used for FACS analysis and a FACS Aria III
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was used for cell sorting.
Flowjo software (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA) was used
for data analysis. Standard protocols were followed for
all experiments. TAMs in tumor tissues and macrophage
in peritoneal cavity were gated as F4/80+ population.
Macrophages in bone marrow were gated as described
previously [20].

Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacture’s
instructions. Reverse transcription was achieved using
Super Script First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was performed using a
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (AppliedBiosystems,
Foster City, CA). The sequences for all primers are listed
in Table S1.

Nanopro immunoassay

Cell proliferation assay

Nanopro immunoassay (NIA) was performed
using Nanopro 1000 (Protein Simple, Santa Clara, CA)
following manufacturer’s protocol. TAMs were sorted
and lysed with Bicine/CHAPS Lysis buffer plus 1×DMSO
inhibitor mix and 1×aqueous inhibitor mix (Protein
Simple, Santa Clara, CA) at 104 cells/μl. Cell lysis was
mixed with 2.7M urea/53mM DTT (1:3) and treated for 5
min at RT. Then samples were mixed with Premix G2 5-8
(Protein Simple, Santa Clara, CA), including pI standard
(Protein Simple, Santa Clara, CA) at a ratio of 1:3, and
loaded into 384-well microplate. For each experiment,
samples were analyzed in duplicate. Data analysis was
carried out using Compass Software (Protein Simple,
Santa Clara, CA).

For BrdU incorporation assay, tumor-bearing
mice were injected i.p. with 100ul of 10 mg/ml BrdU
16hrs prior to preparation of tumor tissue samples. Then
enriched and labeled cells were further stained with
BD PharmingenTM APC BrdU Flow Kit (BD, San Jose,
CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For Ki67
staining assay, enriched and labeled cells were fixed
and permeabilized by Cytofix/Cytoperm™ Fixation/
Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD, San Jose, CA), then
stained with PE-conjugated anti Ki67 according to the
standard procedure. BrdU+ or Ki67+ cells in TAMs or TAM
subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Immunofluorescence and Wright-Giemsa staining

Dynamic array analysis

To identify Namalwa-V, Namalwa-M, and
Namalwa-S, cells were collected and incubated with
primary antibody against human M-CSF at a dilution
of 1:100 followed by incubation with DylightTM
649-conjugated anti-mouse IgG before performed FACS
or dropped on slides. To study the distribution of TAMs
in tumor tissues, immunofluorescence staining of tumor
sections (4-µm thick) was performed as described
previously [31]. Briefly,  sections were incubated with
primary antibody against F4/80 at a dilution of 1:100
followed by incubation with DylightTM 649-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG. Slides or sections were scanned analyzed
under a confocal laser microscope (UltraView Vox,
PerkinElmer, MA).
TAM subpopulations were sorted and spun to slides
and Wright-Giemsa staining was performed. The slides
were examined under a light microscope (AXIO Observer
A1, ZEISS, Germany).

Dynamic array analysis of gene expression in TAM
subpopulations was performed following instructions
of BioMark™ real time PCR system. Briefly, 104 cells
were sorted directly into lysis buffer RLT (RNeasy
mini-kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was extracted
and reverse transcribed into cDNA for further specific
target amplication (STA). STA consists of 2 min at 95
°C to inactivate reverse transcriptase and activate Taq
enzyme, followed by 14 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 4 min
at 60 °C. Preamplified cDNA was diluted with TE buffer
(1:5) before used for real-time PCR. Gene expression
was analyzed using BioMark™ 96·96 Dynamic Array
(Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA). The PCR consists
of 10 min hot-start at 95°C to activate the Taq polymerase,
followed by a 40 cycles two-step program (15 s at 95°C
and 60 s at 60°C). All The TaqMan primers and probes
(AppliedBiosystems, LifeTechnologies, Foster City, CA)
used were listed on table S2. Data were analyzed using
BioMark™ Real-Time PCR Analysis Software (Fluidigm,
South San Francisco, CA).

Responses of TAMs to LPS and IL-4
TAMs were sorted from different tumor
microenvironments and cultured in 24-well plates for
24hrs with or without 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis) or 20ng/ml IL-4 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ).
