ABSTRACT:
Although novel drugs have contributed immensely to improving outcomes
of patients with multiple myeloma (MM), many patients develop drug resistance
and ultimately succumb to MM. Here, we show that artesunate, an anti-malarial
drug, reliably induces cell death in vitro in naïve as well as drug-resistant MM
cells at concentrations shown to be safe in humans. Artesunate induced apoptosis
predominantly through the non-caspase mediated pathway by primarily targeting
mitochondria and causing outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization that led
to cytosolic and subsequent nuclear translocation of mitochondrial proteins apoptosis
inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG). Nuclear translocation of AIF
and EndoG was accompanied by low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
increased mitochondrial production of superoxide. These effects were present before
apoptosis was evident and were related to intracellular levels of bivalent iron (Fe+2).
Artesunate’s unique mechanism probably was at least partially responsible for, its
ability to act synergistically with multiple anti-myeloma agents. Our findings suggest
that artesunate acts through iron to affect the mitochondria and induce low ROS and
non-caspase–mediated apoptosis. Its potency, toxicity profile, and synergism with
other drugs make it an intriguing new candidate for MM treatment.

INTRODUCTION

based and animal studies [5-8]. These drugs constitute an
important class of FDA-approved antimalarial agents, of
which artesunate (ART) is the most potent available today
[9]. ART’s clinically proven favorable toxicity profile for
malaria treatment [9], combined with its potential as a
cancer chemotherapeutic, prompted us to examine its in
vitro anti-MM activity.
In this study we establish the in-vitro effectiveness
of ART against MM and in MM models of BZ resistance.
Furthermore, we show that ART induces apoptosis
mainly through the non-caspase mediated pathway,
primarily targeting mitochondria, and that the effect is
related to intracellular levels of bivalent iron. MM cells’
“commitment” to apoptosis after treatment with ART is
characterized by low cellular levels of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). These unconventional mechanisms
of action could help explain the absence of crossresistance to ART in MM models of in-vitro established

With therapeutic advances over the last two decades,
5-year life expectancy for patients diagnosed with multiple
myeloma (MM) has increased from 15% [1] to 70%
[2]. Nevertheless, treatment of patients diagnosed with
high-risk MM [3] or those who relapse after exposure
to a multitude of anti-MM agents remains a significant
challenge. For instance, Kumar et al. recently showed that
MM patients who developed resistance to bortezomib (BZ)
and IMiDs have an ominous median survival prognosis of
only 9 months [4]. This patient population is in clear need
of new drugs without cross-resistance to existing agents
and, ideally, that function through a mechanism that has
not yet been exploited for therapy.
Recent research has demonstrated that artemisinbased endoperoxide drugs can function as experimental
cancer chemotherapeutics with significant activity in cellwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drug resistance. We developed two BZ-resistant (BR)
sublines of BZ-sensitive cell lines JJN3 and U266 by
exposing cells to increasing concentrations of BZ. JJN3BR
and U266BR exhibited 20-fold increases in BZ IC50 (48
h), compared to BZ-naïve parental cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B). Treating JJN3BR and U266BR cells with
ART resulted in no evidence of cross-resistance, compared
to parental cell lines; similarly treating dexamethasone
(DEX)-resistant cell line MM-1R and its DEX-sensitive
mate MM.1S resulted also in no cross-resistance. In-vitro
anti-MM effectiveness of ART was also evident in CD138selected primary MM cells from six patients with relapsed/
refractory MM (Supplementary Table S1B).

RESULTS
ART inhibits viability of MM cell lines and
primary MM cells, regardless of prior drug
resistance, in a dose- and time-dependent manner
To assess the efficacy of ART as an antimyeloma
agent, we first evaluated its impact on the viability of the
MM cells. ART was able to inhibit viability in clinically
achievable concentrations [10] and in a time-dependent
manner in IL-6-independent and -dependent MM cell lines
(Suppl. Table S1A; Fig. 1A-E). The MM cell line RPMI
8226/R5 which is known to exhibit one of the highest BZ
IC50s among MM cell lines [11] proved to be among the
most sensitive to ART.
Motivated by this finding and by the clinical
importance of drug resistance in treating MM, we sought
to investigate the effects of ART in different models of

MM cell lines
We investigated the mechanism behind ART’s ability
to induce cell death in MM cells. In several cell lines,
flow cytometry analyses of annexin V and PI positivity
indicated that ART induced early and late apoptosis (Fig.
2A-E); BZ resistance had no effect on ART’s ability to

induce apoptosis. To further elucidate ART’s mode of
action, we determined the sequence and level of caspase
activation. ART exposure initiated the extrinsic pathway
of apoptosis with a brisk increase in levels of activated
caspase-8 at 3 h, followed by activation of caspase-9 at 6
h (Fig. 3A). A prominent increase in the levels of effector
caspase 3/7 was evident after 12 h of ART exposure (Fig.
3A). To further examine the role of caspases in inducing
apoptosis after ART exposure, we evaluated the impact of
pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-mfk on the effectiveness of
ART. Z-VAD-mfk effectively inhibited caspase activation
by ART (Fig. 3B) but did not block ART’s effects on cell
viability—at least 70% of ART’s effect was retained in
JJN3, U266, and RPMI 8226/R5 cells (Fig. 3C). Similar
results were obtained in flow cytometry-based apoptosis
assays (Supplementary Fig. S2A-B)

To investigate the molecular effectors involved in
ART’s induction of non-caspase–mediated apoptosis, we
examined the translocation of the two main mitochondrial
factors implicated in this type of apoptosis, AIF and
EndoG. When JJN3 cells were exposed to 125 μΜ ART,
AIF translocated from mitochondria to cytoplasm at 6 h
and to the nucleus at 12 h (Fig. 4); the soluble apoptogenic
AIF Δ 1-102/118 isoform was readily detected in the

abnormally low levels of ROS in MM cells

cytoplasmic fraction [12] (Fig. 4). Similarly, EndoG
cytoplasmic and nuclear translocation were evident
at 6 h and became more prominent at 12 h, especially
in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 4). Because nuclear
translocation of AIF and EndoG has been directly related
to DNA damage and fragmentation [13], we evaluated
the cleavage of PARP-1, a nuclear protein that repairs
DNA damage [14] and whose cleavage is associated with
apoptosis characterized by excessive DNA damage [15]
. Indeed, cleavage of PARP-1 in the nuclear fraction was
clearly evident at 24 h, well after nuclear translocation
of AIF and EndoG. Similar results were obtained for
RPMI8226/R5 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).

Because ART-mediated apoptosis occurs primarily
through the non-caspase pathway, which evolves from
mitochondrial factors, we examined the effects of ART on
mitochondria by using JC-1 dye [16] to measure changes
in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in JJN3
and RPMI-8226 cells. The ratio of the 545-nm (green
fluorescence) and 595-nm (red fluorescence) emissions
readings was used as a surrogate for the ΔΨm, since this
ratio is not affected by factors such as mitochondrial
size, shape, and density, which may influence singlecomponent fluorescence signals. As early as 30 minutes
after exposure to ART, a small but statistically significant
change occurred in the ΔΨm. This change persisted for 12
hours, when a brisk and continuous increase in the ΔΨm
was observed (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Because mitochondrial function plays a pivotal
role in the cellular ROS balance [17], we examined the
effects of ART treatment on the ROS status and production
of mitochondria-derived superoxide. ART treatment
resulted in a small but steep increase in ROS level within
30 minutes after drug exposure; however, by 12 h, the
ROS level was well below that of untreated control cells
(Fig. 5B). The decrease in ROS level cannot be due to
a reduced number of viable cells because annexin V
staining (indicating apoptotic cells) was negligible at the
12-h time point (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Interestingly,
the reduced cellular ROS level was accompanied by high
levels of mitochondria-derived superoxide (Fig. 5C). The
paradoxical reduction in cellular ROS levels and increase
in mitochondrial superoxide production that occurred 12 h
after ART treatment also occurred in RPMI-8226/R5 MM
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4D-E). In contrast, 12 h after
treating cells with BZ at a comparable effective dosage

(10nM) the ROS level was clearly higher than that of
control cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C).

1 are consistent with a synergistic effect. ART exhibited
profound synergism with all tested agents in medium to
low dosages. At high dosages the effect was either additive
(DEX, BZ) or slightly antagonistic (DOX) (Figure 6A-C).
However it should be noted that in the high concentrations
the IC50 values were exceeded for all agents.

ART’s efficacy depends on the levels of
intracellular bivalent iron
An iron dependent mechanism that directly affects
the redox cycle of the parasite has been proposed for the
antimalarial action of ART [18]. We therefore proceeded
to examine the effect of iron in ART’s anti-MM efficacy.
Supplementation of growth medium with bivalent iron in
the form of Iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate at a concentration
of 0.8 mg/L (i.e. within the normal range of iron levels in
human blood (0.6–1.7 mg/L)) drastically increased ART’s
anti-MM efficacy, as evidenced by a marked decrease
in its IC50 in JJN3, INA-6, RPMI-8286, and U266 cell
lines (Supplemental Table S2). This decrease in IC50
was much less pronounced when the protein-bound form
of iron, holotransferrin, was used and did not achieve
statistical significance when the trivalent form of iron
(Iron(III) citrate) was used at the same concentration,
as was the bivalent form (Supplemental Table S2).
Deferoxamine, an iron chelator that can enter the cells
[19], exerted clear antagonism to ART (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). The potentiating effect of bivalent iron and
the inhibitory effects of deferoxamine were also reflected
in levels of ROS and mitochondrial superoxide at the
various time points (Supplementary Fig. S5B and C). To
clarify whether ART’s anti-MM efficacy is potentiated by
intracellular or extracellular bivalent iron, we examined
the combined effects of ART and EDTA, a potent metal
chelator that does not enter the cells [20]. Addition of
EDTA had no statistically significant effect on ART’s
IC50 (Supplementary Fig. S5D), suggesting that it is the
intracellular bivalent form of iron which potentiates ART’s
efficacy.

DISCUSSION
Artemisinin and its derivative ART have been
reported to have anticancer activity in many different in
vitro tumor models [6]. This report establishes ART’s in
vitro effectiveness against MM cells and elucidates the
mechanisms by which this agent induces apoptosis of
MM cells. Our observations suggest that ART induces
apoptosis primarily through the non-caspase mediated
pathway and that the mitochondria are ART’s primary
target in MM cells. Furthermore, initiation of apoptosis
was characterized by low levels of cellular ROS levels and
a marked increase in mitochondrial superoxide, an effect
that has not been previously reported for other drugs.
Non-caspase mediated apoptosis has not been
studied extensively [24]. The main factors implicated
in this form of apoptosis are the AIF and EndoG [25].
In our experiments ART induced non-caspase apoptosis
was related to translocation of AIF and EndoG initially
from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and subsequently
to the nucleus. While whether or not non-caspase
mediated apoptosis is the dominant pathway of ART
induced apoptosis seems to be cell type dependent [7],
Zhou et al [26] also found non-caspase apoptosis in lung
adenocarcinoma cells as the main mechanism of ART
induced cell death. Furthermore, ART caused the release
of the apoptogenic isoform Δ 1-102/118 of AIF from the
mitochondria, which has been shown to be an aftermath
of the outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization
(OMMP) [12]. The OMMP leads to a loss to the ΔΨm and
an increase in ROS [27]. It should be noted that these two
events coincided early in the timeline of ART exposure and
were concurrent with the release of both Δ 1-102/118 AIF
and EndoG to the cytoplasm. The nuclear translocation of
AIF and EndoG initiated apoptosis in MM cells a finding
consistent with the effects of these two factors in other
type of cells [28, 29]. Moreover this nuclear translocation
preceded the cleavage of PARP-1 , in accordance with
other reports [30], providing further evidence that the
cell death of MM cells from ART exposure is through
programmed apoptosis. PARP-1 cleavage, an indicator
of late apoptosis [31], followed the nuclear translocation
of AIF and EndoG supporting thus the role of these two
factors in the ART induced apoptosis in MM cells.
While the biggest difference in ΔΨm was found
at 12 hours, changes that were statistically significant
were found as early as 30 minutes after drug exposure.
This was accompanied by a small but brisk increase in
the ROS level of the cells. It should be noted that while

ART exhibits synergy with various anti-MM
agents
Due to the different pathway of inducing apoptosis
in ART we then tried to examine the effect of the
combination of ART with the known anti-MM agents,
DEX, doxorubicin(DOX) and BZ that are known to induce
apoptosis through the caspase dependent pathway with a
high ROS accumulation. While ART induces apoptosis
primarily through a non-caspase dependent pathway,
anti-MM agents DEX, doxorubicin(DOX), and BZ
induce apoptosis through the caspase dependent pathway
characterized by high levels of ROS [21-23]. For this
purpose the “Synergy” program was applied as described
in the methods section and the Interaction Index (II) was
used as an index of interaction evaluation. Values greater
than 1 are consistent with antagonistic effect, values equal
to 1 are consistent with additive effect and values less than

the mitochondria are the primary target of ART, for the
caspase dependent pathway of apoptosis it is the extrinsic
pathway that is activated first. This activation is an early
event and occurs at the time of increased ROS production.
It has been shown that increased ROS levels can activate
the extrinsic pathway of caspase dependent apoptosis
by ROS induced sphingomyelinase activation, ceramide
production and death receptor clustering [32]. However, at
least in MM cell lines, it does not seem to be the increased
level of ROS that actually induces apoptosis but the way
ART interferes with the redox status of the cell.
The increased mitochondrial superoxide production
from the beginning of ART exposure does not translate
to an overall increase in cellular ROS levels. In fact the
opposite happens; at 12 hours when the mitochondrial
derived superoxide level is at its highest, cellular ROS
level is well below that of the untreated control. This
paradox could imply that ART directly interferes with
the Fenton reaction for production of free radicals
from superoxide. In this reaction, bivalent iron plays a
fundamental role, and inhibition of iron reduction from
the bivalent to the trivalent form diminishes production

of hydroxyl and free oxygen radicals [33]. This proposed
mechanism is supported by our finding that ART’s effects
on mitochondria and induction of apoptosis are strongly
related to intracellular levels of bivalent iron. The
interaction of ART with bivalent iron in malarial parasites
also has been implicated in the drug’s anti-plasmodial
effect [34].
Early and sustained mitochondrial superoxide
overproduction combined with the early change in the
ΔΨm, as observed in our experiments, is consistent with
a complex I mitochondrial dysfunction [17]. Interestingly,
complex I function is highly dependent on the FMN
cofactor, which passes electrons through a chain of seven
FeS (iron sulfur) centers to the CoQ reduction site [35],
where the bivalent or trivalent state of iron is of crucial
importance for the electron transport. Non-caspase
mediated apoptosis has been linked with loss of cellular
respiration and dysfunction of mitochondrial complex
I that precedes nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG
[36]; this is consistent with our findings from MM cell
lines treated with ART. In addition, it has been shown
that, even in caspase-dependent ΔΨm dissociation, the

iron-containing NADH-ubiquinone oxireductase subunit
of complex I is primarily affected [37]. Dysfunction of
Complex I has been linked with superoxide overproduction
along with ΔΨm alterations [38]. Similar findings
pertain to the iron-containing subunits of mitochondrial
complexes II [39] and III [40]. Also of importance is the
fact that heme seems to be one of ART’s target molecules
in cancer cells, where it reduces heme (bivalent iron) to
hemin (trivalent iron) [41]. Heme is essential to many
protein complexes and one of them, cytochrome C,
plays a fundamental role in the electron transport chain
of the mitochondria [42]. Thus the mitochondrion, with
its abundance of iron provides an ideal environment for
the action of ART. Although we have not shown depletion
of bivalent iron as a direct effect of ART, circumstantial
evidence - as laid out in this study - suggest Fe+2 as a
target of ART. We have summarized this in Supplementary
Fig. S6. In clinical studies for malaria ART was shown
to have an excellent toxicity profile [9, 43], with the
most significant finding a transient minimal reduction
of the reticulocyte count in a phase I dose escalation
study [10]. In vitro studies with human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells found the IC50 to be more than 100μM
a dosage which as shown here exceeds several times the
IC50 in MM cells [44]. When dihydroartemisinin (DHA)
- the primary metabolite of ART- was tested in cultures
of human CD34+ selected cells only a transient effect
on erythroid maturation was evident. No differences
in cell number between cells cultured with and without
DHA were seen in long term cultures, regardless of the
time exposure to DHA [45]. ART was able to overcome
resistance in both BZ as well as DEX resistant MM cell
lines regardless of whether the resistance was native or
acquired. Additionally, we were able to show synergy
between ART and several frontline anti-MM agents,
which are known to cause caspase-dependent, high-ROS
apoptosis. Through these unique mechanisms ART not
only has the ability to act independently but can also
complement and augment the effect of other anti-myeloma
agents. Primary BZ resistance of a subpopulation of MM
cells in the clinical setting has been identified as the main
mechanism failure of BZ to eradicate the disease [46].
These data provide the rationale for further “in vivo”
experiments to establish the therapeutic potential of ART
either alone or in combination with other agents especially
in the relapsed/refractory MM setting.
In conclusion ART is an effective single agent, has
synergy with known myeloma agents and can overcome
resistance to BZ in preclinical models of MM. One
possible explanation for these beneficial effects is that
ART induces apoptosis through a unique mechanism of
non-caspase mediated apoptosis and low levels of cellular
ROS. While more work needs to be done to elucidate
the entire mechanism of the ART-induced initial ROS
production, mitochondrial dysfunction and the specific
redox signaling sequelae that result in apoptosis, and for

could potentially be the forerunner of a whole new class of
agents for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell models, cell culture, and experimental
conditions
MM cell lines RPMI 8226/R5, INA-6, MM-1S,
MM-1R, KMS-11, ARH-77, JJN3, U266; BZ-resistant
(BR) sublines JJN3BR and U266BR; and patientderived primary MM cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
(Corning) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals), 100 U/ml penicillin/
streptomycin, and 2-mM L-glutamine and were incubated
at 37˚C with 5% CO2. Interleukin (IL)-6-dependent cells
and purified plasma cells from patients were supplemented
with 2-ng/ml IL-6 (R&D Systems). All cell lines were
authenticated by a method of copy number variant (CNV)
fingerprinting developed by Jonathan Keats and P. Leif
Bergsagel [47].
Patient samples were collected under a protocol
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS).
Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Mononuclear cells from bone
marrow aspirates were isolated by density gradient
centrifugation over Ficoll-Hipaque Plus. Plasma cells
were then isolated with immunomagnetic bead selection
for CD138+ cells in a Midi MACS LS column following
the manufacturer’s recommendations (Miltenyi Biotec).
Plasma cell purity was confirmed by flow cytometric
analysis with phycoreythrin-conjugated CD38 and CD45
antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec).
Stock solutions of ART (Sigma-Aldrich) and BZ
(LC Laboratories) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and used as indicated, with a final vehicle
concentration that did not exceed 0.5% (vol/vol). All
chemicals, unless otherwise indicated, were purchased
from Fisher Scientific.

Cell extract preparation and Western blot analysis
Mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and nuclear fractions
from cultured cell lines JJN3 and RPMI-8226/R5 were
isolated with Cell Fractionation Kit Standard from (Mito
sciences). Protein samples were fractionated with SDS
PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane. Antibodies
for apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), poly (ADP ribose)
polymerase-1 (PARP-1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
and mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase (MTCO)
were purchased from Abcam, antibody for β-actin was
purchased from Cell Signalling Technology, and the

indicated time period, cells were incubated with 3.5 μM
JC-1 for 15 minutes at 37˚C. After this incubation period
cells were then rinsed and transferred to a 96-well plate
for fluorescence measurement by a plate reader with the
following settings: excitation 485 nm, emission 545 nm
and 595 nm, cutoff 530 nm. The ratio of measurements at
545 nm/595 nm was used as the measurement of the ΔΨm.

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was measured with CellTiter 96
AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay
(MTS) (Promega) as published elsewhere [48]. Briefly,
myeloma cells were seeded in 96 wells at a concentration
of approximately 2 × 104 cells per well. After incubating in
culture medium alone for 24 hours, anti-myeloma agents
were added in, in serial 2-fold dilutions titrated according
to the potency of each agent. MTS was added to each
well at the time points indicated for each experiment.
Absorbance was read at a 490 nm wavelength according to
the manufacturers recommendations. All tests were done
in triplicates.

ROS and mitochondria-derived superoxide
detection and quantification
For the determination of ROS and mitochondrial
derived superoxide generation, cells were treated with
drugs at indicated doses and time. On the day of the
analysis, 0.5x 106 cells were resuspended in 1 mL prewarmed PBS and incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA (Life
Technologies) or in 0.5 ml DPBS with 5 μM MitoSOX
(Life Technologies) for 30 min at 37°C. Then, cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS and subjected to flow cytometry
using the FACSVerse (Becton Dickinson). Data were
analyzed with FC Express software (De Novo).

Statistical analysis
IC50 calculations and the respective curves were
generated by GraphPad Prism v6.0 Software. The effect
of the interaction of different agents on combination
treatment (synergistic, additive, antagonistic) was analyzed
with the freeware program “Synergy” based on the R
statistical language (R v2.13.1) as published elsewhere
[49]. For each interaction-effect experiment, the ChouTalalay method [50] was primarily used and results were
verified with the Plummer method [51]. For comparisons
of treatment groups, unpaired t-tests (Mann-Whitney),
paired t-tests, and one-way or two-way ANOVA (where
appropriate) were performed. For ANOVA, Bonferroni
posthoc analysis was used to compare treatment groups.
All analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism
v6.0. Differences with a P value ≤ 0.05 were considered
significant.

Caspase activation and quantification assay
Identification and quantification of the activated
caspases 3/7, 8, and 9 was performed through the use of
the CaspaseGlo assay (Promega), as published elsewhere
[54]. Pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was purchased
from R&D and was applied at a concentration of 200μM
every 24 hours unless otherwise indicated.
