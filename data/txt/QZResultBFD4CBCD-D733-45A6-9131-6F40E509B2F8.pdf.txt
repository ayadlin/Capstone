Abstract
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are critical mediators of immunosuppression and
the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous work indicates that
HSCs promote HCC progression by enhancing immunosuppressive cell populations
including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs).
MDSCs are induced by inflammatory cytokines (e.g., prostaglandins) and are important
in immune suppression. However, how HSCs mediate expansion of MDSCs is uncertain.
Thus, we studied activated HSCs that could induce MDSCs from bone marrow cells and
noted that HSC-induced MDSCs up-regulated immunosuppressive activity via iNOS,
Arg-1, and IL-4Rα. After treating cells with a COX-2 inhibitor or an EP4 antagonist,
we established that HSC-induced MDSC accumulation was mediated by the COX2PGE2-EP4 signaling. Furthermore, in vivo animal studies confirmed that inhibition of
HSC-derived PGE2 could inhibit HSC-induced MDSC accumulation and HCC growth.
Thus, our data show that HSCs are required for MDSC accumulation mediated by the
COX2-PGE2-EP4 pathway, and these data are the first to link HSC and MDSC subsets
in HCC immune microenvironment and provide a rationale for targeting PGE2 signaling
for HCC therapy.

Introduction

have immunomodulatory activity and prolong islet
allografts survival [6, 7]. We reported that activated
HSCs can induce immune-suppressing cells, specifically
regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSCs) in tissues of tumor-bearing mice [810]. MDSCs are heterogeneous immature myeloid cells
comprised of myeloid progenitors and precursors of
macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs) [11,
12]. Murine MDSCs co-express CD11b and Gr-1 [11] and
their heterogeneity is also based on expression of Gr-1:
granulocytic-MDSCs (G-MDSCs, CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Cint/
low
), and monocytic-MDSCs (Mo-MDSCs, CD11b+
Ly6G-Ly6Chigh) [13, 14]. Höchst’s group reported that
activated HSCs can recruit and transform peripheral
blood monocytes into de novo MDSCs [15] but how HSCs
induce MDSC expansion and activation is unclear.
Recently, Qian and colleagues reported that HSCs

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most malignant tumors and the third leading cause
of cancer-related deaths around the world [1, 2].
Hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex and multi-factorial
process and at this time, some molecular pathways
have been identified that contribute to the development,
progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis of HCC. The
tumor microenvironment is of interest in cancer research
and is now recognized as a critical contributor to cancer
progression. Infiltrating stromal and immune cells in the
tumor microenvironment contribute to cancer biology as
well [3].
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are important stromal
cells that are activated during liver injury, inflammation,
infection, trauma, or by other pathogens [4, 5]. HSCs

induced MDSCs via soluble factors secreted by HSCs
and expanded these data by revealing that complement
component 3 (C3) is critical for inducing MDSC expansion
and protecting islet allografts [16]. However, HSCs
deficient in C3 did not completely lose their capacity to
induce MDSCs, implying the involvement of other factors
that may synergize with C3 to promote MDSC induction.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) promote
MDSC activity in cancer [11, 17] but Qian et al has proved
that these factors do not involved in induction of MDSC
[7] , so additional factors are required for induction of
MDSCs by HSCs.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a pro-inflammatory
mediator produced by cancer, stromal, and infiltrating
myeloid cells and acts on G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs) including EP1-EP4 [18]. Cyclooxygenase
(COX)-2 is chiefly believed to be key to influencing the
rate of PGE2 production during immune response [19].
A positive feedback loop between PGE2 and COX-2
determines the redirection of the development of CD1a+
DCs to CD1a-CD14+CD80-CD83- monocytic MDSCs
[20]. Furthermore, Kalinski’s group reported that addition
of PGE2 to GM-CSF/IL-4-supplemented monocytic
precursor cultures generated numerous MDSCs [21].
Silencing COX-2 in 4T1 tumor cells reduced CD11b+Gr-1+
MDSC accumulation in mouse spleens [11]. Moreover,
PGE2 can be produced by HSCs [22-24], which suggested
the hypothesis that HSCs induce expansion of MDSCs via
secreted PGE2. For this reason, bone marrow (BM) cells
were cultured with HSC-conditioned medium (HSC-CM)
plus SC-236, a COX2 inhibitor. Then, the effect of SC236-treated HSCs on MDSC expansion and tumor growth
was assessed.

half (decreased from 55.9 ± 2.1% to 33.7 ± 1.9%, P <
0.01. Figure 1C, upper panel). CD11b/Gr-1 co-staining
confirmed the presence of MDSCs, which doubled (25
± 2.9% in control vs. 54.9 ± 2.4% in HSC-CM, Figure
1C, middle panel). MDSCs can be divided phenotypically
into granulocytic (MDSCs, CD11b+/Ly6G+/Ly6Cint/
low
) and monocytic (Mo-MDSCs, CD11b+/Ly6G-/
Ly6Chigh) subgroups, which have been shown to be
immunosuppressive via different pathways. Figure 1C
(bottom panel), depicts G-MDSCs and Mo-MDSCs
induction in HSC-CM culture and that upregulation of
Mo-MDSC was most prominent and these findings agree
with those of Qian’s group [16]. To verify the specific
HSC-CM effect on MDSC expansion, we used CM from
MEF cells as controls and noted that MEF-CM had no
effect on MDSC expansion, and the influence of HSC-CM
on BM cells was concentration-dependent (Figure 1D).
To study immunosuppression of MDSCs, Gr-1+ cells
were isolated using MACS, and more than 90% of the Gr1+ cells were CD11b+Gr-1+. MDSCs were cultured with
T cells (1:1). As shown in Figure 1E, MDSCs inhibited
T-cell proliferation. It has been reported that elevated
expression of Arg-1, iNOS, and IL-4Rα accounts for
suppression of T-cell function by MDSCs [11, 25]. For
this reason, the mRNA expression of each protein was
detected, and a 2-fold increase in iNOS mRNA, a 4.5fold increase in Arg-1 mRNA, and a 4-fold increase in
IL-4Rα expression were detected (Figure 1F). In this way,
HSC-CM inhibited DC development and promoted MDSC
accumulation in vitro.

Results

Factors such as cytokines (IL-6) [26, 27], stemcell factor (SCF) [28], growth factors VEGF, TGF-β,
GM-CSF, G-CSF, and macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (M-CSF), COX-2, and PGE2 [21, 29, 30] have been
reported to induce MDSC expansion. IL-6 is abundantly
produced by activated HSCs according to previous work
from our laboratory and that of others [9], so we speculated
that HSCs may induce MDSC accumulation via IL-6. To
test this hypothesis, IL-6 neutralizing antibody was added
to HSC-CM cultures of BM cells and MDSCs did not
decrease compared to the HSC-CM group (Figure 2A), so
IL-6 does not apparently mediate the effect of HSC-CM
on MDSC induction.
PGE2 influences MDSC expansion and is secreted
by activated HSCs [23, 24], so to assess whether HSCCM induced MDSC expansion was correlated with PGE2
production, HSCs were pretreated with SC-236, a COX-2
inhibitor. Figure 2B depicts no significant cytotoxicity of
SC-236 against HSCs (5-20 μM), but PGE2 production
was inhibited by SC-236 (Figure 2C).

Induction of MDSCs from BM cells by HSCconditioned media is mediated by PGE2
production

Incubation of BM cells with conditioned media
from activated HSCs induced MDSCs
First, BALB/c BM cells were cultured with HSCCM and cell surface marker expression by various myeloid
cell types after HSC-CM treatment was measured. Figure
1A shows BM co-cultured with HSC-CM decreased
CD11c, MHC II, CD86 and CD80 expression, suggesting
less BM cell differentiation into macrophages and
immature DCs. Meanwhile, Gr-1 increased significantly
and a slight increase in B7-H1.
Next, the expression of DCs, MDSCs, and MDSC
subsets were detected after BM cells were cultured with
HSC-CM. The gating strategy of these cells is shown
in Figure 1B. As shown in the Figure 1C, the number
of CD11b+CD11C+ DCs decreased by approximately

BM cells were cultured with the HSC-CM or
conditioned media from 20 μM SC-236-pretreated
HSCs (SC-236-CM) for 3 days. Flow cytometry
indicated a significant increase of MDSCs in the HSC-

CM group compared to controls (Figure 2E). SC-236CM significantly reduced MDSCs induced by HSCCM (Figure 2D), suggesting the importance of PGE2 in
inducing MDSCs by HSC-CM.

We next investigated the effect of SC-236 on MDSC
subgroups. HSC-CM upregulated expression of both
CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Cint/low G-MDSCs and CD11b+Ly6GLy6Chigh Mo-MDSCs, especially Mo-MDSCs (Figure
2E). SC-236-CM abolished G-MDSCs promotion by
HSCs, and they decreased in the HSC-CM and SC236-CM groups. However, the effect of HSCs on MoMDSCs induction was not altered significantly by SC-236

treatment, suggesting that induction of Mo-MDSCs was
independent of PGE2 production in HSCs.

EP4 antagonists block MDSC accumulation
MDSCs from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice are known to
express four E-prostanoid receptors (EP) for PGE2 [30].

To validate that HSCs induces MDSC accumulation via
the PGE2/EP signaling way, BM cells were cultured with
IL-4 and GM-CSF with/without CM, or with/without EP
antagonists. Figure 3A shows that HSC-CM upregulated
expression of MDSCs. When BM cells were cultured with
HSC-CM plus EP antagonists, only the EP4 antagonist
inhibited induction of MDSCs by HSC-CM. Data show
that accumulation of MDSCs induced by HSCs was
mediated through the PGE2/EP4 signaling.
Because the stimulatory effect of HSCs on MoMDSCs only slightly decreased with SC-236 treatment.
Next, experiments were conducted to determine whether
the G-MDSC and Mo-MDSC subsets induced by HSCs
were regulated by the PGE2/EP4 signaling. As shown
in Figure 3B, AH23848 (EP4 antagonist) inhibited the
G-MDSC but not Mo-MDSC expansion by HSC-CM.
Taken together, these in vitro data indicated that HSCderived PGE2 induced the expansion and differentiation
of MDSCs, especially the G-MDSC subset, through the
EP4 receptor.

to that observed in the HSC group (P < 0.05).
Next, we sought to evaluate the subsets of MDSCs
in tumors co-transplanted with HSCs or SC-236-pretreated
HSCs. As Figure 4C shows, co-transplanted HSCs
significantly increased both the percent of G-MDSCs and
Mo-MDSCs in spleen and tumor, whereas HSCs pretreated
with SC-236 presented a reduction in G-MDSCs and
Mo-MDSCs expression both in the spleen and tumors,
respectively. To evaluate MDSC immunosuppressive
activity, MDSCs were isolated from the control group,
HSC co-transplanted group, and SC-236 pretreated group.
As shown in Figure 4D, MDSC immunosuppressive
activity showed no obvious difference among three groups.
The data from the subcutaneous model (Supplementary
Figure 2) were consistent with the orthotopic HCC model.
To confirm whether the increase in MDSCs in the HSC
group was due to the higher tumor burden of these mice,
the population of MDSCs was assessed in the spleens
of mice at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after tumor
injection. The data show that the MDSCs in the HSCs
were higher than those in the control group and SC-236
group since at the first week when tumors did not different
in size among groups (Supplementary Figure 3). These
findings suggest that COX-2 antagonist SC-236-pretreated
HSCs could reduce the tumor size and the population of
MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice.

Inhibition of COX-2 activity in HSCs impairs
MDSC induction in vivo
To understand how HSCs-produced PGE2 affects
accumulation of MDSC cells in vivo, a murine orthotopic
HCC model was established. The liver capsule was
injected with H22 cells alone (1 × 106 cells/mouse, control
group), or H22 plus HSCs (2 × 105 cells/mouse, HSC cotransplanted group), or H22 and SC-236-pretreated HSCs
(2 × 105 cells/mouse, SC-236 pretreated group) (n = 8/
group). Figure 4A shows that tumors from the HSC cotransplanted group were significantly larger than those of
controls, a finding that agreed with previous observations
[10]. In addition, tumors were smaller in the SC-236
pretreated group compared to the HSC co-transplanted
group, suggesting that HSC pretreated with SC-236 lost
tumor-promoting activity.
Because the primary tumor burden by itself does
not dictate the level of MDSCs [30], we then further
investigated the accumulation of MDSCs in the spleen and
inside the tumor among the 3 groups via flow cytometric
analysis (Figure 4B). Significant differences in the
percent of MDSCs in the spleen between control group
and HSC co-transplanted group with or without SC-236
pretreatment were observed (8.4% vs. 16.7% for control
vs. HSC co-transplanted group, P < 0.01; 16.7% vs. 12.3%
for HSC co-transplanted group vs. SC-236 pretreated
group, P < 0.05). Further analysis of MDSCs population
in the tumors revealed a similar pattern. As shown in
Figure 4B (bottom panel), there was a significant increase
in the percent of MDSCs in the tumor in the HSC cotransplanted group relative to the H22 alone group (8.9%
vs. 6.1%; P < 0.05). HSCs pretreated with SC-236 resulted
in a 25% decrease in the MDSC population as compared

Discussion
Researchers across the world have made great
strides in understanding the role of the tumor environment
in tumor progression, but cross-talk between stromal
and immune cells in cancer progression and metastasis
is entirely unexplored. Our previous work indicates
that activated HSCs can create an immunosuppressive
microenvironment in an orthotopic liver tumor mouse
model by inducing expansion of Tregs and MDSCs [10],
but how this occurs is unclear. Qian’s group reported
that MDSCs could be induced by HSC derived C3 to
protect islet allografts, but HSCs deficient in C3 did not
completely lose their capacity to induce MDSCs [16].
Here, we investigated other factors involved in induction
of MDSCs and measured their effects on specific subsets
of MDSCs and noted that HSCs promoted MDSC
accumulation, particularly Mo-MDSCs. Furthermore,
data showed that HSCs promoted G-MDSC expansion via
COX2-PGE2-EP4 signaling, and inhibiting HSC-derived
PEG2 with a COX-2 inhibitor reduced tumor grow and
MDSCs accumulation, which indicated that the PGE2/EP4
pathway was involved in induction of MDSCs by HSCs.
MDSCs are critical mediators of tumor-induced
immune dysfunction and cancer progression [32].
Previous work indicates that MDSC expansion is
regulated by factors such as COX2, PGE2, SCF, M-CSF,
IL-6, GM-CSF, and VEGF [11, 28, 30, 33], most of
which are produced by activated HSCs. IL-6, VEGF,

GM-CSF, and G-CSF have been implicated in MDSC
development [6, 34-37]. Reports suggest that induction of
MDSCs by HSCs is unlikely to be mediated by VEGF,
GM-CSF, or G-CSF [7, 16]. IL-6 is sufficient to drive
MDSC expansion, compared to other factors produced by
various tumors and it causes a rapid generation of MDSCs
from mouse and human BM [38-40]. In BM cell culture,
however, IL-6 neutralizing antibody had little or no effect
on generation of CD11b+Gr-1+ MDSCs (Figure 2A).
PGE2 is known to be a regulator of MDSC accumulation,
MDSC-mediated T cell inhibition, and expression of Arg1
and iNOS [41-43]. Evidence is mounting that activation
of COX-2 signaling results in an alteration of HSCs [44,
45]. In addition, COX-2 and COX-2-dependent PGE2
expression was persistently upregulated in fully activated
HSCs and participated in the chemokines regulation,
VEGF production, and HSC proliferation and migration
[46-48]. PGE2 also induces MDSC expansion [21, 4954], so activated HSCs that produce abundant PGE2 were
evaluated next.
The expression and expansion of MDSCs were
reduced after treatment of HSCs with COX-2 inhibitor
SC-236, which indicated that MDSC induction by HSCs
was mediated by the COX-2/PGE2 pathway. IFN-γ has
been reported to be critical for HSC-mediated MDSC
generation [7] and HSCs deficiency in IFN-γ R1 largely
lose the ability to induce MDSCs. PGE2 signaling is
thought to mobilize the cAMP-PKA pathway via EP2/
EP4 receptors and induce CREB- and its co-activator
CRTC2-mediated transcription of IL-12Rβ2 and IFN-γR1

[55]. Therefore, inhibiting PGE2 signaling may affect
transcription of IFN-γ R1, thereby decreasing MDSCs.
We assessed the effect of COX2 inhibitor SC236 on MDSC subset generation and noted that only
G-MDSC expansion decreased with SC-236 CM but not
Mo-MDSCs. PGE2 exerts its functions by interacting with
PGE2 receptors, of which there are four subtypes (EP14) [56]. PGE2 is reported to induce accumulation of Gr1+CD11b+ MDSCs from BM cells via EP1, EP2, and/or
EP4 receptors [30]. In our study, only an EP4 receptor
antagonist inhibited MDSC expansion and G-MDSC
expansion appeared to be the only cell type affected,
although both G-MDSCs and Mo-MDSCs expressed the
EP4 receptor (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, expansion
of G-MDSCs induced by HSCs was through the COX2PGE2-EP4 signaling pathway and different factors might
be involved in Mo-MDSC expansion.
Qian’s group reported that BM cells cultured with
HSCs deficient in C3 expressed less Ly6C compared
to wild type HSCs, suggesting that C3 may be crucial
for inducing Mo-MDSC (CD11b+ Ly6G-Ly6Chigh cell)
expression [16]. Also shRNA-mediated reductions in
C3 expression in HSCs impaired Mo-MDSC expression
(data not shown). Possibly, C3 has greater priority over
PGE2 for inhibiting Mo-MDSC expression. SC-236 had
no obvious effect on immunosuppressive activity of
MDSCs isolated from tumors, perhaps because of the
abundant inflammatory factors secreted by tumor cells that
stimulate immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs. TGFβ1-induced miR-494 expression in MDSCs is essential

Figure 5: Scheme of MDSC induction signaling pathway by HSCs. In vitro, activated HSC-derived PGE2 inhibits myeloid
progenitor cell maturity and induction of G-MDSC accumulation via the EP4 receptor, which can be reversed with a selective COX2
inhibitor or EP4 antagonist. Inhibition of activated HSC-derived PGE2 reduces HCC growth and HSC-induced MDSC accumulation.

for accumulation and function of tumor-expanded MDSCs
[57].
In our animal model, reduction of HSC-derived
PGE2 with the COX2 inhibitor reduced Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells
accumulation and decreased growth of implanted tumors.
Interestingly, HSCs pretreated with COX2 inhibitor could
better inhibit Mo-MDSC accumulation in vivo, although
the COX2 inhibitor and the EP receptor antagonist had
less effect on Mo-MDSC accumulation in co-culture. This
may be explained by differences in the tumor environment.
Fewer Mo-MDSCs in vivo may result from differentiation
of Mo-MDSCs into other types of immune cells. Ly6C
expression in Mo-MDSC sorted from the spleen of EL-4
TB mice was reported to be down-regulated expression by
~30% after 3 days of culture with GM-CSF [58].
Overproduction of COX2 and PGE2 in the
tumor microenvironment may also explain the local
accumulation of MDSCs observed in different cancers
[32, 59]. HSC co-transplantation induced more PGE2
expression than control group, while co-transplantation
with COX-2 inhibitor-pretreated HSCs produced a
PGE2-reduced microenvironment than in the HSC
co-transplantation group, which reduced Mo-MDSC
accumulation (Supplemental Figure 4), However, HSCsecreted PGE2 influenced MDSC accumulation but not
their immunosuppressive activity. Different chemokine/
chemokine receptor signal axes play different roles
in mediating the mobilization of MDSC subsets. The
CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is necessary for mediating
the attraction of monocytic MDSCs into the tumor
environment and PGE2 is important to regulation of
CXCL12 production in cancer-associated fibroblasts and
the cancer environment, and to enhancement of CXCR4
expression in Mo-MDSCs [29]. CCL2 has been reported
to foster PMN-MDSC accumulation in tumors [60].
The expression of Cxcl12 and Ccl2 was also measured
in the tumor microenvironment, and data show the
expression of Cxcl12 and Ccl2 to be increased in the
HSC co-transplantation group. Relative to the HSC cotransplantation group, Cxcl12 and Ccl2 mRNA expression
was down-regulated in the SC-236 group.
Our data indicate a relationship between
activated HSCs and MDSC subsets in the HCC tumor
microenvironment. HSCs promote G-MDSC accumulation
via COX2-PGE2-EP4 signaling and COX2 inhibition
blocks HSC-derived PGE2 and HSC-mediated induction of
MDSCs, decreasing HSC tumor-promoting ability (Figure
5). We offer a novel mechanistic explanation for the link
between HSCs and HCC progression, targeting PGE2 as
an innovative strategy for future cancer immunotherapy
development.

Animals and cell lines
All experimental protocols were reviewed and
approved by our Institutional Review Board and animal
experimental protocols were performed in compliance
with the Guidelines for the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Xiamen University.
Adult male BALB/c mice (H-2d, haplotype, 8-12
weeks-of-age) mice were purchased from the National
Rodent Laboratory Animal Resources, Shanghai, China.
The mouse H22 hepatoma cell line was purchased from
Shanghai Cell Bank, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT),
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/
mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, as previously
described [9].

HSCs isolation and culture
HSCs were isolated from BALB/c mouse livers
as described previously [9]. Livers were perfused with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and type IV collagenase
(Sigma, city, state), and soaked in collagenase for further
digestion. Isolated HSCs were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, U.S.) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, BRL Co. Ltd.), 100
U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in 5%
CO2/95% air at 37ºC. Cells at passage 4-10 were used for
experiments. Cell activation was measured via a-SMA
staining [9, 31].

Culture of DCs
DCs were prepared according to published methods
[31]. After lysing RBCs with lysis buffer (Beyotime,
Jiangsu, China), 1 × 106 BM cells/well from tibias and
femurs of BALB/c mice were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium containing 10% FBS and mouse recombinant
GM-CSF (10 ng/mL, R&D, Minneapolis, MN, U.S.; IL-4
10 ng/mL, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, U.S.) for 6 days.
To measure the effect of HSCs on BM, (HSC-CM) or SC236, CM was used to replace RPMI 1640 medium at DC
culture initiation. Floating cells were harvested, washed,
and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium.

Isolation of MDSCs
Tumors or spleen were cut into small pieces
and dissociated with a MACS dissociator (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After dissociation, dead

remaining cells were used to isolate MDSCs by bitionGr-1 antibody (BD, San Diego, CA, U.S.) and Streptavidin
MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec).

Splenocytes were harvested and disaggregated
in 10 mL of RPMI 1640 complete medium. RBCs were
lysed with RBC Lysis Buffer (Beyotime, Nanjing, China).
Tumors were cut into small pieces and dissociated with a
MACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After dissociation, dead cells were exclude with DAPI
(0.2 μg/mL), and leukocytes were gated on FSC and
SSC for analysis. Monoclonal antibodies against CD11b,
CD11C, Ly6C, Ly6G, and Gr-1 were purchased from
BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA, U.S.), and antibodies
against CD40, CD86, CD80, MHCI, MHCII, and B7-H1
were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, U.S.).
Fluorescently-labeled cells were analyzed with flow
cytometry (Beckman Gallios). Analysis and graphical
output were performed using with FlowJo software and
appropriate isotype control antibodies were used.

Mixed leukocyte reaction
A mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) culture was
performed in 24-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY).
Nylon wool-eluted splenic T cells (1 × 106/well) from
BALB/c mice were used as responders. T-cell proliferation
was elicited with anti-CD3 mAb (1 μg/mL) and CD28 (1
μg/mL). Cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 complete
medium for 3 days under 5% CO2. T-cell proliferation was
measured with a CFSE dilution assay and flow cytometry.

Tumor inoculation
Mice were injected intra-hepatically with 0.1 mL
cell suspension containing either 1 × 106 H22 cells or a
mixture of 1 × 106 H22 cells and 2 × 105 activated HSCs
(N = 8/group). To understand the role of HSC-derived
PGE2, HSCs were pretreated with the COX2 antagonist
SC-236 (20 µM) 3 days before inoculation. HSCs treated
with DMSO were controls. At the end of the experiment,
mice were euthanized, and spleens and tumors were
collected and stored for subsequent analysis.

Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version
13.0) and are expressed as means ± SD. Statistical
analyses were performed with a Student’s t test (P < 0.05).
