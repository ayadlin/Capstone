ABSTRACT
We investigated the pre-clinical activities of two novel histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACi), ITF-A and ITF-B, in a large panel of pre-clinical lymphoma
models. The two compounds showed a dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity
in the majority of cell lines. Gene expression profiling (GEP) of diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) cells treated with the compounds showed a modulation of genes
involved in chromatin structure, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, B-cell signaling,
and genes encoding metallothioneins. Cell lines showed differences between the
concentrations of ITF-A and ITF-B needed to cause anti-proliferative or cytotoxic
activity, and cell cycle and apoptosis genes appeared implicated in determining the
type of response. In particular, CDKN1A expression was higher in DLBCL cells that,
to undergo apoptosis, required a much higher amount of drug than that necessary to
induce only an anti-proliferative effect.
In conclusion, the two novel HDACi ITF-A and ITF-B demonstrated antiproliferative activity across different mature B-cell lymphoma cell lines. Basal CDKN1A
levels appeared to be important in determining the gap between HDACi concentrations
causing cell cycle arrest and those that lead to cell death.

INTRODUCTION

The family of histone deacetylases (HDACs)
is divided into four classes: class I HDACs are
predominantly localized in the nucleus and comprise
HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8; class II HDACs, subdivided into
class IIa (HDAC4, 5, 7, 9) and class IIb (HDAC6 and
10), shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm; class III
HDACs comprise Sirtuins 1-7 and are mainly localised
in the nucleus and mitochondrion. Differently from
the zinc-dependent HDACs in the other three classes,
Sirtuins require NAD+ to catalyse deacetylation. HDAC
class IV only contains HDAC11, a nuclear HDAC [5,
6]. HDACs are aberrantly expressed in various solid
and hematological cancers including diffuse large B-cell

Despite the important advances made in the
treatment of B-cell lymphomas, particularly with the
addition of the monoclonal antibody Rituximab to
standard chemotherapy, significant numbers of these
neoplasms are still refractory to currently used therapies
[1, 2]. The importance of epigenetic mechanisms in
lymphomagenesis is known, with specific histone and
chromatin modification enzymes targeted by inactivating
mutations and genomic aberrations [3, 4]. These
observations suggest that targeting of the epigenome in
lymphomas may be therapeutically beneficial.

lymphomas (DLBCLs) and peripheral T-cell lymphomas
(PTCLs) [7-9]. Due to their targeting of multiple histone
and non-histone proteins, including regulators of
proliferation and apoptosis, alterations in their expression
can contribute to tumorigenesis [5].
HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) function by interfering
in the interaction between HDACs and their substrates [5,
6, 10-13]. Several structurally distinct classes of HDACi
exist and, of these, the hydroxamic acid derivatives are
the most potent [6, 11]. HDACi have shown pre-clinical
and clinical efficacy in T-cell lymphomas leading to the
approval of vorinostat [14], romidepsin [15] and, most
recently, belinostat [16] for the treatment of relapsed
or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and PTCLs.
HDACi appear to exert their anti-tumor activities primarily
by targeting gene transcription [13, 17]. The most
common anti-tumor response to treatment with HDACi
is cell cycle arrest in G1. Arrest in G1 is associated with
transcriptional activation of CDKN1A, the gene encoding
the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1/CIP1 [11, 13,
18]. HDACi can also induce apoptosis and in most cases,
the induction of G1 arrest or apoptosis is governed by
drug concentration, with lower doses inducing cell cycle
arrest and higher doses provoking cell death [10, 19, 20].
Cell type can also contribute to the type of proliferation
inhibition and related to this, the genetic background of the
cell may be an important factor [21]. The expression levels
of several genes have been associated with the response to
HDACi: overexpression of BCL2, BCL2L1, STAT1, STAT3
and the antioxidant genes TXN (thioredoxin), SOD2, GSR
(glutathione reductase) has been reported to correlate with
resistance to HDACi [22, 23]. Induction of CDKN1A
expression following HDACi treatment is also associated
with resistance to HDACi-mediated cytotoxicity and cells
that fail to upregulate CDKN1A/p21WAF1/CIP1 following
HDACi treatment readily undergo apoptosis [19, 20].
Here, we assessed the preclinical activities and the
mechanism of action of two novel HDACi, in over 30
lymphoma cell lines.

228nM). The majority of IC50 values were below 20nM
and 50nM for ITF-A and ITF-B, respectively (Figure 1a).
In addition to IC50 values, we also determined GI50 (50%
Growth Inhibition), LC50 (50% Lethal Concentration)
and TGI (Total Growth Inhibition) values (see Methods
for further explanation). Similarly to the IC50 values, the
ranges of GI50, LC50 and TGI were narrower for ITF-A
than for ITF-B (Supplementary Figure 1a). The IC50
and GI50 are similar anti-proliferation parameters and
comparbly to the IC50 values, most cell lines had GI50
values less than 20nM or 50nM for ITF-A and ITF-B,
respectively. We did not observe any association between
lymphoma histology and IC50, GI50, LC50 or TGI for
either of the two HDACi (Supplementary Figure 1b).
We also assessed the ability of ITF-B and ITF-A to
inhibit HDAC activity. The DLBCL cell lines DoHH2 and
TMD8 treated with ITF-B or ITF-A showed increases in
nuclear acetylated histone H3 and cytoplasmic acetylated
α-tubulin levels (Figure 1b). Thus, ITF-B and ITF-A
exhibited nuclear and cytoplasmic activities and caused
the acetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins.

The anti-proliferative effects of ITF-A and ITF-B
are mainly due to a block in the cell cycle
Following the demonstration of the anti-proliferative
effects of ITF-A and ITF-B in lymphoma cell lines, we
performed cell cycle and apoptosis analyses. We treated
cells with fixed doses of 20 nM ITF-A or 50 nM ITF-B
for 72 hours. Only the MCL cell line JeKo-1 exhibited
a marked induction of apoptosis, as determined by flow
cytometry analysis of Annexin V-stained cells (Figure
1c), also supported by cell cycle analysis, which showed a
prominent accumulation of sub-G1 cells (data not shown).
Among the eight cell lines, the induction of apoptosis
could not be predicted from IC50 or GI50 values: seven
out of eight cell lines had IC50 or GI50 values that were
lower than the administered doses of HDACi but did
not exhibit a marked induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle
analysis at the used doses showed that in the absence
of apoptosis, arrest in G1 was responsible for the antiproliferative effects of the two HDACi (Figure 1d,
Supplementary Figure 2a). Of the cell lines tested, the
DLBCL cell line U2932 was the only one that did not
undergo arrest in G1 in response to HDACi treatment,
likely because its IC50 and GI50 values were much higher
than the doses used for these experiments. These results
indicate that at doses representative of the IC50 or GI50
the main anti-proliferative effect of the two HDACi is
to block the cell cycle. This observation is in agreement
with reported results obtained with other HDACi [10,
24], which usually mediate a block in the cell cycle. Since
we also had data indicating concentrations at which each
HDACi could be cytotoxic, we treated selected lymphoma
cell lines with the respective LC50 doses of each HDACi.

RESULTS
ITF-A and ITF-B exhibit anti-proliferative
activities in lymphoma cell lines
We assessed the anti-proliferative activities of
two new HDACi, here termed ITF-A and ITF-B, using
the MTT cell viability assay in 24 diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, 5 mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL) cell lines and 3 splenic marginal zone lymphoma
(SMZL) cell lines. ITF-A and ITF-B presented dosedependent anti-proliferative activities with median IC50
(50% Inhibitory Concentration) values of 12nM for ITF-A
(range, 1.5nM – 103nM) and 34nM for ITF-B (range, 5 –

At the LC50 doses we observed a marked induction
of apoptosis in all cell lines tested, confirming that at
these doses, both HDACi were able to induce cell death
(Supplementary Figure 2b).

HDACi similarly modulate specific processes as well as
the expression of multiple genes in DLBCL cells (Figures
2a, 2b). Commonly modulated gene sets included those
defining signaling processes, those defining the structure
and composition of chromatin, gene sets determining
the transcription and translation of nucleic acids as well
as gene sets comprising genes involved in cell cycle
progression and apoptosis (Figure 2b, Supplementary
Tables 1-4). For the ABC cell line TMD8, gene sets
for the NfκB signaling cascade were also modulated
(Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The number and variety
of gene sets obtained following HDACi treatment
demonstrated the widespread effects of the two HDACi on
diverse cellular processes, a phenomena also observed for
other HDACi [17, 25]. When comparing transcriptional
changes at the single gene level, genes that were commonly
up-regulated for both cell lines following treatment with
either HDACi comprised anti-proliferation and proapoptotic genes, including several cyclin-dependent kinase

Treatment of DLBCL cell lines with ITF-A and
ITF-B induces diverse transcriptional changes
To better understand the transcriptional changes
that occur following treatment of cells with ITF-A and
ITF-B, we performed gene expression profiling (GEP)
experiments on two DLBCL cell lines: DoHH2 (GCBDLBCL) and TMD8 (ABC-DLBCL). Cells were treated
for 8 hours with 100nM of ITF-A, 200nM of ITF-B or
DMSO. Treatment with either HDACi affected diverse
processes in both cell lines as determined by Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Similar gene sets were
enriched in both cell lines, suggesting that the two

the top 100 most up-regulated genes, genes encoding
histones, tubulin genes and metallothionein genes were
frequently represented (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).
Down-regulated genes included pro-survival and proproliferation genes such as MYC, CCND2 and NFKB1.

correlated with LC50 values for both HDACi suggesting
that they may be specifically associated with the cytotoxic
effects of ITF-A and ITF-B. For SOD2, the correlation
between expression and LC50 values for ITF-B and
ITF-A respectively, were r2 = 0.569, p-value = 0.001 and
r2 = 0.542, p-value = 0.002). For GSR, the values were r2
=
0.444, p-value = 0.013 and r2 = 0.419, p-value = 0.020
for ITF-B and ITF-A, respectively (Supplementary Table
8). Overexpression of STAT1 and STAT3 transcripts has
been reported to reduce sensitivity to some HDACi, but
we did not observe an association between dose response
values and STAT1 or STAT3 expression. Furthermore, as
mentioned above, we did not observe any association
between dose response values and DLBCL cell of
origin, suggesting that the presence of phosphorylated
and constitutively activated STAT3 that is exclusively
observed in ABC-DLBCL, was unlikely to be associated
with response. Inactivating mutations of the histone
acetyltransferase genes EP300 and CREBBP, were not
associated with response in DLBCL cells (Supplementary
Figure 4), which frequently harbor mutations of these
genes [3, 4]. At the level of gene expression, CREBBP
exhibited no correlation with IC50 values for either
HDACi, but showed a positive association with LC50
values for ITF-B (r2 = 0.431, p-value = 0.016). EP300
expression negatively correlated with LC50 values for
both HDACi (r2 = -0.382, p-value = 0.035 for ITF-B and
r2 = -0.485, p-value = 0.006 for ITF-A).

As described above, lymphoma cell lines generally
underwent G1 cell cycle arrest when treated with HDACi
representative of IC50 or GI50 doses. However, some cell
lines presented small differences between doses conferring
cell cycle arrest (GI50 doses) and those inducing cell
death (LC50 doses), while other cell lines presented large
differences between these values. We were therefore
interested in determining if distinct genetic features
characterized these different cell lines. We focused on 23
DLBCL cell lines for which we had drug response data
as well as baseline GEP data (e.g., GEP data from cells
grown under normal culture conditions, in the absence
of HDACi treatment), to prevent histology-specific
genetic signatures from masking signatures specifically
associated with response. For each of these 23 cell lines,
LC50 values were divided by GI50 values to obtain
LC50/GI50 values. For each HDACi, the 23 DLBCL
cell lines were assigned to one of two groups using the
median LC50/GI50 value for each HDACi as a cutoff.
For ITF-B, GSEA showed the enrichment of multiple
cell cycle associated gene sets in the group of cell lines
with high LC50/GI50 values i.e. with LC50/GI50 values
greater than the median (Supplementary Table 7 and
Figures 3a, 3b). Genes associated with inhibiting cell cycle
progression and promoting cell cycle arrest (CDKN1A,
CDKN1B, CDKN2A) were more highly expressed in
the high LC50/GI50 group (Figure 3b). Comparison of
CDKN1A levels in high and low LC50/GI50 cell lines
showed that CDKN1A was specifically overexpressed in
the high LC50/GI50 group (p = 0.032) (Figure 3c). These
observations indicate that the high LC50/GI50 and low
LC50/GI50 groups comprise cell lines with genetically
distinct transcriptomes, which may be important in
mediating their response to treatment with HDACi.
We then looked at the association between the
anti-proliferation responses of all 32 lymphoma cell
lines used in this study and genetic or biological features
previously reported as being associated with resistance
to HDACi (Supplementary Table 8). The overexpression
of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2 and BCL2L1) has been
associated with resistance to HDACi [26]. Expression of
BCL2L1 was positively correlated with IC50 values for
ITF-A (r2 = 0.490, p-value = 0.006), but not with IC50
values for ITF-B (r2 = 0.227, p-value = 0.219). Expression
of BCL2L1 was not associated with LC50 values for
either of the two HDACi. BCL2 expression exhibited no
correlation with IC50 or LC50 values. Additionally, when
considering only DLBCL cell lines we did not observe
any association between BCL2 translocation status and
IC50 values (Supplementary Fgure 4). Increased levels of
the antioxidant genes SOD2, glutathione reductase (GSR)
and thioredoxin (TXN) have also been associated with
resistance to HDACi treatment [26]. SOD2 and GSR levels

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have demonstrated the antiproliferative activities of two novel HDACi in a
panel of 32 lymphoma cell lines. ITF-A and ITF-B are
hydroxamic acid HDACi. These novel HDACi target
classes I, IIb and IV HDACs. Both HDACi showed
the ability to inhibit the proliferation of lymphoma cell
lines of different histologies (DLBCL, MCL and SMZL)
without any association between potency and lymphoma
histology, also when comparing GCB-DLBCL and
ABC-DLBCL. For both HDACi, IC50 values were in
the nanomolar range with most cell lines displaying
IC50 values below the thresholds of 20nM for ITF-A
and below 50nM for ITF-B. These values compare
favourably with other HDACi currently in the literature
[13, 17]. We demonstrated the ability of the two novel
HDACi to reverse the deacetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins: ITF-A and ITF-B were able to induce the
acetylation of histone H3 and α-tubulin in the DLBCL cell
lines DoHH2 and TMD8.
In order to better understand the mechanisms
of action of the two HDACi, we performed GEP on
two DLBCL cell lines that had been treated with each
HDACi. We observed the modulation of multiple
transcripts and consequently, of numerous signaling
pathways and biological processes following the 8 hours

treatment. These processes included those regulating
cell cycle progression and apoptosis, although these
were not the most frequently altered processes. The top
100 up-regulated genes following treatment primarily
comprised histone, tubulin and metallothionein genes.
Metallothioneins comprised 8/100 (8%) of the top 100
up-regulated genes. Metallothioneins are a class of heavymetal binding proteins that also scavenge free radicals.
HDACi treatment has been shown to up-regulate their
expression in certain cell types, and they may be involved
in drug resistance [27, 28]. The top 100 down-regulated
genes, which included the pro-survival genes MYC,
CCND2 and NFKB1 likely comprised genes that were
targeted for down-regulation following HDACi treatment,
probably via mechanisms that specifically reduce the
binding of acetylated histones and specific transcription
factors to the regulatory regions of these genes [21].
The anti-proliferation response to HDACi can either
result from cell cycle arrest or apoptosis [18]. It is not fully
clear which factors determine a cytostatic or a cytotoxic
response to HDACi although HDACi concentration and
cell type are likely to play major roles [18, 29]. Studies
investigating the anti-proliferation activities of anticancer drugs usually consider the IC50 as a measure of
cellular response and drug potency. Determination of
additional dose response parameters may provide further
information that assists in identifying genetic and/or
biological characteristics that influence response [30]. In
this study, we also determined GI50, LC50 and TGI values
in addition to IC50 values. These measurements enabled
us to determine doses at which each HDACi was cytotoxic
i.e. the LC50 dose, in each cell line. We observed that at
doses representative of the IC50 or GI50, most cell lines
tested underwent cell cycle arrest in G1 with little or
no apoptosis. Interestingly, cell lines displayed marked
differences when comparing their LC50 and GI50 values.
Thus, we performed functional annotation analysis
comparing cell lines with larger lold differences between
their LC50 and GI50 values (high LC50/GI50 group) to
those with smaller lold differences between their LC50
and GI50 values (low LC50/GI50 group). We observed
that the cell lines belonging to the high LC50/GI50
group were specifically enriched of cell cycle gene sets
compared to the low LC50/GI50 group. When looking
closer at the single gene level, several genes encoding
cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors showed a trend for
overexpression in the high LC50/GI50 group and of these
CDKN1A was more highly expressed in the high LC50/
GI50 group than in the low LC50/GI50 group, suggesting
that high basal expression of CDKN1A might protect cells
from HDACi-mediated cytotoxicity. This observation is
important considering the critical role of CDKN1A in
the anti-proliferation response to HDACi treatment [11,
13, 18, 31]. The ability of HDACi to increase CDKN1A
expression is the main mechanism by which they mediate
cell cycle arrest in G1 [11, 13, 18]. However, increased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CDKN1A expression can also protect cells from
cytotoxicity [19] and indeed, therapies combining HDACi
with agents that abrogate HDACi-mediated induction of
CDKN1A enhance HDACi-mediated apoptosis [32].
Recently it has been shown that cell lines resistant to
another hydroxamic acid derived HDACi, belinostat,
exhibit prolonged up-regulation of CDKN1A/p21WAF1/CIP1
following treatment with belinostat and do not undergo
apoptosis whereas sensitive cell lines only transiently upregulated CDKN1A/p21WAF1/CIP1 and underwent apoptosis
[20]. This together with our observations indicates that
the baseline level of CDKN1A/p21WAF1/CIP1 as well as
the duration of its induction following HDACi treatment
[20] are important in determining a particular cell’s antiproliferative response to such treatment.
The expression levels of several genes have been
shown to impact on the response to HDACi treatment.
Among these, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic
genes BCL2 and BCL2L1 has been reported to confer
resistance to HDACi [21, 23, 33]. We did not observe any
association between expression levels of BCL2 and IC50
or LC50 values for the 32 cell lines used in this study.
Expression of BCL2L1 was only positively correlated
with IC50 values for ITF-A. Notably, the expression of
the antioxidant genes SOD2 and GSR correlated positively
with LC50 values for both HDACi. The role of antioxidant
genes in conferring resistance to HDACi-induced
cytotoxicity has been reported [22, 34] and it is interesting
that levels of SOD2 and GSR correlate strongly with LC50
values, suggesting that their higher expression specifically
impedes a cytotoxic response.
Recent discoveries of the prevalence of inactivating
mutations in the acetyltransferase genes EP300 and
CREBBP in lymphomas have highlighted the crucial
role of epigenetics in the pathobiology of lymphomas,
including especially DLBCL [3, 4]. As HDACi are
epigenetic drugs that mediate changes in the acetylation
levels of numerous histone and non-histone proteins, it is
possible that the presence of mutated EP300 and CREBBP
proteins may affect the response to HDACi. However, in
DLBCL cells, we observed no correlation between the
mutational status of CREBBP or EP300 and the dose
response values for ITF-B and ITF-A. We also looked at
the expression levels of CREBBP and EP300 transcripts in
all 32 cell lines as factors other than mutation or genomic
aberrations may reduce the expression of these genes [4].
CREBBP expression did not correlate with IC50 values for
either HDACi, but positively correlated with LC50 values
(i.e., the drug cytotoxic activity) for ITF-B. Conversely,
EP300 levels showed a negative correlation with LC50
values for both HDACi.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the robust
anti-proliferative activity of two novel HDACi, ITF-B
and ITF-A. Basal CDKN1A levels appear to be important
in determining the gap between HDACi concentrations
that cause cell cycle arrest and those that cause cell death.

The importance of baseline CDKN1A levels in mediating
cytotoxicity at doses similar to or much higher than the
GI50 has not been previously reported. These data may
be useful in identifying cells that would benefit from
combination approaches using HDACi and agents that
overcome cell cycle arrest.

corresponding to the IC50, GI50, LC50 and TGI were
estimated by fitting a sigmoidal model through the dose
response curve using the R statistical package (www.rproject.org). Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle
were evaluated on cells treated with DMSO or different
doses of ITF-B and ITF-A. For cell cycle analyses, the
percentages of cells in G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell
cycle were determined using the Watson Pragmatic model
and the FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR,
USA).

METHODS
Cell lines and compounds

Western blotting analysis

Established human cell lines derived from
DLBCL, MCL and SMZL were cultured according to the
recommended conditions. All media were supplemented
with fetal bovine serum (10%), Penicillin-StreptomycinNeomycin (~5,000 units penicillin, 5 mg streptomycin and
10 mg neomycin/mL, Sigma) and L-glutamine (1%). Two
novel HDACi were used: ITF-A and ITF-B (Italfarmaco
S.p.A., Milan, Italy).

Protein extractions, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting
were performed as previously described [35]. The
antibodies used were: anti-STAT3 (9139, Cell Signaling),
anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) (9131, Cell Signaling),
anti-Acetyl Histone H3 (Lys27) (8173, Cell Signaling),
anti-Acetyl--Tubulin (Lys40) (5335, Cell Signaling).

Immunohistochemistry

Cell proliferation, cell death and cell cycle

Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and
embedded in paraffin. Antigen retrieval was performed
with Tris-EDTA at pH 9 for 30 minutes at 98°C. A
monoclonal antibody against phospho-STAT3 (Cell
Signaling) was applied. Reactions were developed with
the Ultravision Quanto Detection System (HRP-Polymer
kit (TL-125-QHL, Thermo Scientific).

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (non-tissue
culture treated) at a density of 10,000 cells for all cell
lines except for VAL and JeKo-1, which were seeded
at 20,000 cells per well. Each HDACi was dissolved in
dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). For treatment of cells,
compounds were serially diluted in the appropriate tissue
culture medium, at a range of 7.8 – 500 nM and added to
cells (in five replicates). Cells were incubated for 72 hours
at 37ºC, 5% CO2. DMSO alone was added to negative
control (untreated) cells. Wells containing medium only
were included on each plate and served as blanks for
absorbance readings. MTT; 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie
GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland) was prepared as a 5 mg/ml
stock in PBS and filter-sterilized. MTT solution (22µL)
was added to each well and tissue culture plates were
incubated at 37ºC for 4 hours. Cells were then lysed
with 25% SDS lysis buffer and absorbance was read at
570 nm using an AD340 plate reader (Beckman Coulter
International SA, Switzerland). For each cell line and
biological replicate, a “time zero” (t0) plate was seeded
with the appropriate number of cells per well and
processed immediately to allow a time zero density to be
determined. The IC50 (50% Inhibitory Concentration),
GI50 (50% Growth Inhibition), LC50 (50% Lethal
Concentration: the drug concentration that kills 50% of
the cells that were present at the time of drug addition),
and TGI (Total Growth Inhibition: the drug concentration
that yields no net growth over the course of the assay)
were calculated from absorbance values obtained from the
treatment plates alone (IC50) or from the treatment plates
and time zero plates (GI50, LC50 and TGI). The doses

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
RNA was extracted using TRI-reagent (SigmaAldrich Chemie GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland). Quantitative
Real-time Polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was
performed as previously described [35] (primer sequences
available upon request).

Gene expression profiling
Gene Expression Profiling (GEP) was performed
using the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), as described [35]. Data
processing and statistical analysis were performed using
R/Bioconductor [36]. Transcript mapping was based on
HG19 using manufacturer-supplied annotation. Data were
quantile normalized and subsequently batch corrected
using ComBat [37]. Differential expression analysis was
performed using LIMMA [38]. Functional annotation
was performed using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) software [39, 40]. Raw GEP data are available
on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
(GSE64821).
