Abstract
Here we found loss of c-Cbl, an E3 ligase, expression in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) compared with its adjacent normal tissue in patient specimens. HDAC
inhibition by WJ or knockdown of HDAC 1, HDAC2, HDAC3 or HDAC6 all induced c-Cbl.
Ectopic expression of c-Cbl induced decreased EGFR, inhibited growth in NSCLC cells.
Knockdown of EGFR inhibited NSCLC growth. Mutation of EGFR at Y1045 decreased WJinduced growth inhibition as well as in vivo anti-cancer effect and EGFR degradation
mediated by WJ. Time-lapse confocal analysis showed co-localization of c-Cbl and
EGFR after WJ treatment. Furthermore, WJ inhibited lung tumor growth through c-Cbl
induction in orthotopic and tail vein injected models. C-Cbl up-regulation induced by
HDACi is a potential strategy for NSCLC treatment.

Introduction

cancer usually diagnosed at advanced stage with poor
outcome [10]. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy
remains the mainstay for advanced NSCLC, but toxicities
including leukopenia, nephrotoxicity, or neurotoxicity
hinder its application [11-13]. Although EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitor leads to a great treatment advance of
NSCLC, only a subgroup with EGFR activating mutation
benefit from it.
Transcription factor-mediated gene expression
is regulated by histone modification, in which histone
acetylation induces chromatin relaxation to facilitate
this event [14]. The extent of histone acetylation is
controlled by the balance between histone deacetylases
(HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) [14].
Overexpression of HDACs associated with transcription
repression inactivates tumor suppressor genes, leading
to carcinogenesis and tumor progression [15]. Therefore,
HDACs are therapeutic targets for cancer treatment,
and HDAC inhibitors have been reported to exert
clinical efficacy against hematological malignancies and
preclinical activity for solid tumors [16]. Its mechanisms

Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) protein is an
E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating intracellular signaling [1].
Its dysfunction mutation has been reported to induce
myeloid neoplasm while overexpression inhibits tumor
growth in xenograft models [2, 3], implicating its tumor
suppressive role. C-Cbl acts through E3 ubiquitin ligase
activity to promote epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) internalization and lysosome degradation [1, 4].
Over-expression of EGFR is frequently found in epithelial
cancers and correlated with clinical aggressiveness and
poor outcome [5, 6], suggesting that targeting EGFR is
an important strategy for cancer treatment. Thus, upregulation of c-Cbl might be effective. Clinically, antiEGFR monoclonal antibody and EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) have already led to great success in head
and neck, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancers [79].
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a worldwide

autophagic cell death, mitotic failure, senescence, antiangiogenesis by HIF-1 down-regulation, induction of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inhibition of heat
shock protein 90 (HSP90) [17]. In this study, we found
c-Cbl was lost in NSCLC patients and disclosed a
mechanism that HDAC inhibition could induce c-Cbl
up-regulation, in which histone lysine acetylation
and transcription factor SP1 play important roles. We
synthesized an hydroxamate-based HDAC inhibitor, WJ,
which was more potent than SAHA to inhibit HDAC and
tumor growth. WJ induced c-Cbl up-regulation to degrade
EGFR through lysosome pathway, and knockdown
of c-Cbl reversed WJ-induced anti-cancer effect. WJ
inhibited-lung tumor growths in orthotopic and tail vein
injected mouse models were abolished by Y1045 EGFR
mutation, indicating the critical role of EGFR in the
anti-cancer effect of HDAC inhibition. Therefore, c-Cbl
induction by HDAC inhibition is a promising strategy to

treat lung cancer. This finding contributes to the anticancer
mechanism of HDAC inhibitors in lung cancers.

Results
Tumor suppressive role of c-Cbl in lung cancer
and effect of HDAC inhibitor on c-Cbl induction
Since c-Cbl may play a tumor suppressive role,
its expression in 11 lung adenocarcinoma specimens
from patients was evaluated by immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining. Clinical characteristics of patients
are summarized (Supplementary Table S1). Loss of
c-Cbl expression was found in cancer part compared to
normal part of tissues (Figure 1A). The effect of c-Cbl
on cell viability was evaluated by overexpression of
c-Cbl into A549 cells. c-Cbl overexpression inhibited

antibiodies. D, Knockdown of c-Cbl reversed WJ-mediated growth inhibition after WJ treatment for 48 hours in A549 cells (left panel). The

WJ induced co-localization of c-Cbl and EGFR

cell proliferation and induced PARP and pro-caspase 3
cleavages (Figure 1B). It also down-regulated EGFR
expression (Figure 1B), an important oncoprotein in
lung cancer. Since c-Cbl is a tumor suppressor in lung
adenocarcinoma, we screened a series of small molecules
and found that HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) SAHA could
induce c-Cbl expression (Supplementary Figure S1A and
Figure 1C). Therefore, an HDACi, WJ, which was more
potent than SAHA was employed [18]. WJ induced c-Cbl
expression in NSCLC cells in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Supplementary Figure S1B and Figure 1C).
It showed greater growth inhibitory effect on various
NSCLC cells and less toxicity on normal fibroblasts (MEF
and HS68) compared to SAHA (Supplementary Table S2).
WJ-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis were reversed
by the knockdown of c-Cbl (Figure 1D), indicating that
c-Cbl played a role in HDACi-induced anti-cancer effect.

Since WJ induced c-Cbl to degrade EGFR, the
localization of c-Cbl and EGFR was evaluated in live cells
by time-lapse confocal microscopy. The co-localization of
c-Cbl and EGFR was observed at 30 minutes after WJ
treatment (Figure 3A), and EGFR degradation ocurred
at 60 minutes (Figure 3A and movie 1 in supplementary
material), suggesting that WJ induced co-localization of
c-Cbl and EGFR to degrade EGFR.

Mechanism of WJ-induced c-Cbl expression
To elucidate WJ-induced c-Cbl up-regulation, c-Cbl
mRNA was examined by Q-PCR, which showed increase
in a dose- and time-dependent manner by WJ (Figure
3B). To investigate which HDAC isoform mediates c-Cbl
expression, class I-specific HDACi MS-275 or apicidin
was used and both induced c-Cbl mRNA expression
(Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S2A). Furthermore,
knockdown of HDAC1, HDAC2 or HDAC3 as well as
A549 HDAC6 -/- cells increased c-Cbl mRNA (Figure
3C and Supplementary Figure S2B), suggesting the
involvement of HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6 in c-Cbl expression.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed
that WJ induced acetylation but not methylation of histone
H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) on the c-Cbl promoter (Figure 3D).
There are putative SP1 binding sites within c-Cbl promoter
by sequence analysis and SP1 inhibitor mythramycin
A (MTM) was found to attenuate WJ-induced c-Cbl
expression (Figure 3E), indicating the involvement of SP1
in c-Cbl transcription.

A HDAC inhibitor induced c-Cbl to attenuate
EGFR expression and its downstream signaling
Since WJ could induce c-Cbl expression, its effect
on EGFR was evaluated. WJ induced EGFR downregulation in A549 cells, as well as SAHA and TSA did
(Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S1C). Its effect on
wild-type or mutant EGFR lung adenocarcinoma cells was
further evaluated. WJ down-regulated EGFR expression
in all NSCLC cells and inhibited its downstream AKT
and ERK in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure
2A). Knockdown of c-Cbl reversed WJ-mediated EGFR
inhibition (Figure 2B), suggesting that WJ mediated
EGFR inhibition through c-Cbl expression.
To investigate whether WJ-induced EGFR
degradation was through c-Cbl-mediated lysosome
pathway, lysosome inhibitor NH4Cl or proteasome
inhibitor lactacystin was used. WJ-reduced EGFR
expression was completely reversed by NH4Cl but
partially reversed by lactacystin (Figure 2C), indicating
the involvement of lysosome in this event. Confocal
microscopy further demonstrated the induction of late
endosome/lysosome marker LAMP1 by WJ, and the
reverse of WJ-induced EGFR degradation by NH4Cl (Fig.
2C). WJ was found to induce EGFR phosphorylation at
Y1045, the docking site of c-Cbl, but not Y1068 or Y1173
(Figure 2D). These results indicated that c-Cbl mediated
WJ-induced EGFR degradation through lysosome
pathway. The effect of WJ on EGFR transcriptional
regulation was also examined, and decreased EGFR
mRNA by WJ was seen (Supplementary Figure S1D).
Knockdown of EGFR in A549 cells resulted in
growth inhibition (Figure 2E). Lysosome inhibitor NH4Cl
reversed WJ-induced EGFR degradation as well as growth
inhibition (Figure 2E), indicating that EGFR plays an
important role in HDAC inhibition-induced anti-cancer
effect.

WJ inhibited lung tumor growth in vivo
To evaluate the in vivo anti-tumor effect of WJ,
A549-Luciferase expressing cells were orthotopically
injected into the lung of NOD/SCID mice and
photographed by IVIS imaging system at week 1, 2, and
3 (Figure 4A). Significant lung tumor growth was seen
after three weeks injection. WJ and cisplatin inhibited
tumor growth, which was confirmed by microscopic
examination. Both agents were more effective than SAHA
(Figure 4A-4C). However, cisplatin induced body weight
loss (Figure 4D). Induction of c-Cbl, down-regulation of
EGFR and inhibition of its downstream AKT and ERK
accompanied with induction of PARP cleavage were
seen in the lung tissues of WJ-treated group (Figure 4E).
Acetylations of histone H3 and tubulin were also observed
(Figure 4E).
To further examine the activity of WJ, CL1-5 cells
were intravenously injected into NOD/SCID mice via the
tail vein. Lung tumor nodules were evident three weeks
after injection (Figure 5A). WJ was more potent than

Discussion

lung injection of Y1045-mutant EGFR A549-Luciferase
expressing cells into NOD/SCID mice (Figure 6B). The
anti-tumor effect of WJ was abolished in Y1045F-mutant
EGFR A549-Luc orthotopic lung tumors and WJ inducedEGFR degradation in wild-type EGFR A549 tumors was
not seen in Y1045F-mutant EGFR A549 tumors (Figure
6B and 6C), indicating the critical role of EGFR in lung
cancer formation. However, the induction of c-Cbl by WJ
was not affected by Y1045F EGFR mutation (Figure 6D).

We recently found that HDAC inhibitors (HDACi)
act through transcription inhibition to induce EGFR
down-regulation and growth inhibition in colon cancer
cells [19]. In the present study, we further demonstrated
that up-regulation of c-Cbl in vitro and in vivo mediated
HDACi-induced EGFR degradation and anti-cancer effect
on NSCLC. Knockdown of HDAC1, HDA2, HDAC3, or
HDAC6 all induced c-Cbl up-regulation through mRNA
transcription. SP1 is an important transcription factor

degradation is c-Cbl-dependent and mainly through
lysosome.
C-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that could
be indirectly activated by EGFR to potentiate EGFR
signalings in EGFR wt NSCLC cells [31]. Amplification
of c-Met provides an escape mechanism of EGFR
inhibition leading to TKI resistance in NSCLC [32].
Combined targeting c-Met and EGFR leads to an increase
of xenograft antitumor activity in NSCLC [31]. Our data
showed that WJ induced c-Met degradation in addition
to EGFR down-regulation (Supplementary Figure S4A).
Recently, the concept of synthetic lethality implied that
combined inhibition of two or more genes leads to cell
death whereas either one does not [33]. The exploration
of synthetic lethality might be a approach to overcome
drug resistance in cancer treatment [33]. Our data showed
that WJ-induced c-Met degradation is c-Cbl-dependent
and through endocytosis (Supplementary Figure S4BS4D). However, lysosome or proteasome inhibitor both
reversed this effect, suggesting the different destination
of c-Cbl-mediated EGFR or c-Met degradation. The
extent of protein ubiquitination might affect the route of
degradation [34, 35]. For example, monoubiquitination
facilitates receptor endocytosis and lysosomal degradation
while polyubiquitination targets proteins for proteasomal
degradation [34, 35]. It is possible that the extent of c-Cbl
mediated ubiquitination of EGFR or c-Met determines
the subsequent degradation route, which merits further
investigation.
In addition to c-Cbl induction, several mechanisms
are responsible for the inhibition of EGFR protein
stability by HDACi. For example, LBH589 reduced
EGFR expression in NSCLC cells through increasing the
acetylation of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), resulting
in the dissociation of HSP90 and EGFR leading to EGFR
degradation [36]. Inhibition of HDAC6 was found to
enhance the endocytosis of EGFR through increasing
tubulin acetylation [37, 38]. In this study, mRNA of EGFR
and c-Met was also decreased by WJ (Supplementary
Figure S4E), indicating that both decrease in EGFR
protein stability and inhibition of EGFR transcription
contribute to the anti-cancer effect of HDACi.
In conclusion, our findings showed that HDAC
inhibitors act through in vitro and in vivo induction of
c-Cbl to exert great activity against NSCLC. Therefore,
Up-regulation of c-Cbl contributes to anti-cancer effects
of HDAC inhibitor to serve as a treatment against NSCLC.

closely associated cell growth and differentiation [20]. WJinduced c-cbl up-regulation was reversed by SP1 inhibitor,
suggesting the involvement of SP1 in c-Cbl expression.
Our data showed loss of c-Cbl expression in lung cancer
patients compared with their adjacent normal epithelium.
Ectopic expression of c-Cbl induced growth inhibition and
apoptosis as well as EGFR down-regulation in NSCLC
cells, confirming the tumor suppressor role of c-Cbl.
Therefore, c-Cbl up-regulation serving as a treatment
against NSCLC contributes to anti-cancer effects of
HDAC inhibitor in lung cancer. However, c-Cbl has been
reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer and promote
tumor progression by inhibiting tumor-suppressive TGF-β
activity [21]. The role of c-Cbl on cancer formation might
depend on different cellular context.
The great success of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) in NSCLC with EGFR activation mutation implies
the critical role of EGFR in EGFR mutant NSCLC [22,
23]. The efficacy of EGFR TKI is modest in NSCLC
without EGFR activating mutation [i.e. wild-type (wt)
EGFR] and the role of EGFR in EGFR wt NSCLC is less
addressed [24, 25]. We demonstrated that knockdown
of EGFR inhibited NSCLC cell growth. Furthermore,
mutation of EGFR at Y1045 attenuated WJ-induced cell
growth inhibition as well as its anti-cancer effect and
EGFR degradation in vivo, suggesting the important
role of EGFR in EGFR wt NSCLC. Lysosome inhibitor
NH4Cl also reversed both EGFR down-regulation and
growth inhibition mediated by WJ. Therefore, HDACi
mediates anti-NSCLC effect through c-Cbl-induced
EGFR degradation. Our HDAC inhibitor is more potent
than SAHA to exert in vivo anti-cancer effect and far less
toxic than cisplatin, the backbone of chemotherapeutic
agent against NSCLC. The expression of EGFR per
se independent of kinase activity has been reported
to stabilize the active glucose transporter, SGLT1, to
prevent cell death [26]. By degradation of EGFR, WJ
exerted promising anti-cancer effect like cisplatin. This
effect might be resulted from EGFR degradation per
se beyond TKI-induced EGFR inactivation. Therefore,
HDAC inhibition-induced EGFR degradation might be a
promising strategy for the treatment of EGFR wt NSCLC.
A number of clinical trials regarding HDAC inhibitors for
NSCLC are undergoing [16] .
C-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination is the most
elucidated pathway for EGFR degradation [1, 27, 28].
We found WJ induced c-Cbl up-regulation concomitant
with EGFR down-regulation. Similarly, over-expression
of c-Cbl induced EGFR down-regulation. However, c-Cbl
knockdown reversed WJ-mediated EGFR degradation.
Furthermore, WJ induced co-localization of c-Cbl and
EGFR. Lysosome or proteasome was reported to be
responsible for EGFR degradation [2, 28-30]. We also
found lysosome inhibitor completely reverse WJ-induced
EGFR degradation but partially done by proteasome
inhibitor. All these suggested that WJ-induced EGFR

10% Chelex (Bio-Rad), then boiling them to reverse the
cross-linking and centrifuging them to remove the Chelex
slurry. For ChIP-on-chip assays, the DNA was further
purified through phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
extraction and ethanol precipitation. Real-time PCR was
performed with the purified DNA using the following
primers: 5’-GCCAACCTCCCGCCCACAAG-3’ and
5’-GTCTTCCCCGCCCCTA CGCC-3’.

Development of orthotopic lung cancer models
Seven-week-old male NOD/SCID mice were
anesthetized by continuous flow of 2-3% isoflurane.
A549-Luc cells (2 × 106) suspended in 40 μl of PBS were
injected percutaneously into the right lung of the mice
using 500 μl Gas-Tight syringes with 27G top winged
infusion set. These mice were then given endotoxon-free
luciferse substrate and photographed using IVIS-200
imaging system once a week. When lung tumor nodules
were detected, the mice were treated intraperitoneally with
WJ (50 mg/kg), SAHA (50 mg/kg) or vehicle (DMSO) 5
days a week for 2 weeks.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay
Immunohistochemistry was performed with Onestep Polymer-HRP Detection Kit (Biogenex) on sections
from 10% paraffin-embedded samples according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. Pictures were acquired using
TissueFAXS (TissueGnostics).

Transient transfection and siRNA knockdown
The plasmids and SmartPool siRNA (Dharmacon)
were transfected with Lipifectamine 2000 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 50% confluent cells in
6-well plate are transfected with indicated concentrations
of plasmid or siRNA in 1 mL of serum-free medium for 6
h at 37°C. Then, 1 mL of medium containing 20% FBS is
added to the transfection mixture. After 48 hours, cells are
treated with WJ for 24 hours. The cells are lysed and the
protein expression is analyzed by western blot.

Statistical analysis
The SPSS program (SPSS Inc.) was used for all
statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
by Student’s t-test. p<0.05 (*) and p<0.01 (**) were
statistically significant. Data shown were representatives
of at least three independent experiments. Quantitative
data are presented as means ± standard error (SE).
