Abstract
The effect of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) on immune cells is not
elucidated. Here, we demonstrate PDGF inhibited the maturation of human DCs and
induced IL-10 secretion. Culture of PDGF-DCs with T cells induced the polarization
of T cells towards FoxP3 expressing T regulatory cells that secreted IL-10. Gene
expression studies revealed that PDGF induced the expression of C-type lectin like
receptor member 2, (CLEC-2) receptor on DCs. Furthermore, DCs transfected with
CLEC-2 induced T regulatory cells in DC-T cell co-culture. CLEC-2 is naturally expressed
on platelets. Therefore, to confirm whether CLEC-2 is responsible for inducing the
T regulatory cells, T cells were cultured with either CLEC-2 expressing platelets or
soluble CLEC-2. Both conditions resulted in the induction of regulatory T cells. The
generation of T regulatory cells was probably due to the binding of CLEC-2 with its
ligand podoplanin on T cells, since crosslinking of podoplanin on the T cells also
resulted in the induction of T regulatory cells. These data demonstrate that PDGF
upregulates the expression of CLEC-2 on cells to induce T regulatory cells.

INTRODUCTION

results in DCs which induce T cell tolerance. Such DCs
are known as tolerogenic DCs (Tol DC). Tol DCs induce T
cell tolerance by generation of Ag-specific, anergic CD4+
T cells and the peripheral induction of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+
T regulatory cells (Tregs) [7, 9].
This has led to the development of a number of in
vitro methods for the generation of Tol DCs. Both genetic
and pharmacological inhibitors have been investigated.
Modification of DC in vitro with immunosuppressive
cytokines such as IL-10, transforming growth factor-β
(TGF-beta) or molecules such as indoleamine dioxygenase
[IDO], is a relatively simple way to generate TolDC [10,
11]. Similarly, in vitro treatment of DCs by molecules that
prevent their activation also generates Tol DCs. Examples
include drugs that inhibit nuclear factor κB (NFκB)
signaling-for example, the BAY 11-7085 compound,
dexamethasone and vitamin D3 [12, 13].
Platelets release several factors such as, TGF-β,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) on aggregation [14-16].
PDGF along with VEGF is considered a key driver of
angiogenesis [17]. PDGF and its receptor, platelet-derived
growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β), are essential to
pericyte recruitment, a critical component of maturing

Inhibition of immune response is essential to
prevent uncontrolled cell activation and inflammation,
both of which are detrimental to the body. Chronic
inflammation is the hallmark of autoimmune diseases
such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis etc [1, 2].
Inflammation is controlled by regulatory T cells (Tregs)
which are potent suppressors of cellular activation. It is
well established that the number and function of Tregs is
severely compromised in inflammatory and autoimmune
disorders [1, 3, 4]. Immunotherapy with Tregs is also
useful in transplantation where these cells can dampen the
immune response and prevent graft rejection [5].
Antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells
(DCs) are capable of inducing Tregs. DCs play a crucial
role in initiating immunity against invading pathogens
and maintaining tolerance against self-antigens [6-8].
Encounter with pathogens activates DCs resulting in
upregulation of antigen presenting and costimulatory
molecules along with secretion of pro-inflammatory
cytokines. In contrast, self-antigens induce secretion
of anti-inflammatory cytokines [6-8]. Absence of
costimulation and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines

blood vessels [17, 18]. In addition to their effects on
vasculature, these factors also affect the immune cells
since the receptors for these factors are also expressed on
DCs and T cells [19]. Both TGF-β and VEGF have been
demonstrated to suppress DC activation [20, 21]; however,
the effect of PDGF on DCs has not been investigated.
Here we report that PDGF has a profound effect on
human DC functions and induces T regulatory cells via
the expression of C-type lectin like receptor member 2
(CLEC-2).

PDGF induces IL-10 in DCs
PDGF exists as 3 different isoforms in humans,
PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB with PDGF-AB
being the most abundant isoform [17, 22]. DCs were
cultured with PDGF-AB at concentrations ranging from

PDGF upregulates the expression of C-type lectin
receptor, CLEC-2 on DCs

1-100ng/ml for 48h. Addition of PDGF did not lead to
change in expression of antigen presenting (HLADR)
and maturation makers (CD40, CD80, CD86, CD83) on
DCs (Figure 1A). Data presented is with PDGF at 10ng/
ml since other concentrations of PDGF were comparable.
The cytokine secretion by DCs was determined
using multiplex bead assay. PDGF stimulated DC (PDGFDC) secreted significantly higher (p < 0.05) levels of IL-10
compared to unstimulated DCs (Figure 1B). The secretion
followed a bell shaped curve with maximum secretion
being observed at a concentration of PDGF 10ng/ml. The
levels of TNF-α, CXCL-8, IL-6, MCP-1, and CXCL-10
were comparable to unstimulated DCs (data not shown).
These data suggest that DCs stimulated with PDGF may
be immunosuppressive.
To further confirm that indeed PDGF is
immunosuppressive, DCs were treated with PDGF and
subsequently stimulated with TLR-2 ligand, PAM-3
Cysteine (PAM). As is evident from figure 1C, exposure
to PDGF inhibited the upregulation of DC maturation
markers by PAM. Moreover, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α was significantly reduced
(p < 0.05) while the secretion of IL-10 was significantly
increased (p < 0.05) in PDGF exposed, PAM-stimulated
DCs (PDGF-PAM) (Figure 1D). Together, these
data suggest that exposure to PDGF renders the DCs
tolerogenic.

Expression of a variety of inhibitory costimulatory
molecules on DCs can induce T regulatory cells [12]. Here
we determined the expression of Programmed Cell death
Ligand 1 (PDL-1), PDL-2 (B7DC) and B7Rh on PDGFDCs using specific antibodies. There was no significant
difference in the expression of these molecules between
PDGF stimulated DC and controls (Figure 3A). Since
expression of numerous other inhibitory costimulatory
molecules as well as other molecules such as IDO in
DCs can induce the differentiation of T regulatory cells,
we performed affymetrix gene expression microarray
to determine the difference between PDGF stimulated
DC and unstimulated DC. The gene expression pattern
of both groups was highly homologous and only 12 (all
upregulated) genes were significantly different between
the two groups (Table 1). None of the genes were
known to induce T regulatory cells. One of gene which
was significantly upregulated on PDGF stimulated DC
was CLEC-2 which is C-type lectin receptor expressed
primarily on platelets [23]. Since CLEC-2 was the
only gene which was expressed on cell surface and
may possibly interact with T cells to generate Tregs we
focused our attention on this gene. The expression of
CLEC-2 receptor was compared between PDGF-DC
and unstimulated DC using CLEC-2 specific antibodies
(Figure 3B). The expression was significantly higher (p <
0.05) on PDGF-DCs. These data demonstrate that PDGF
induces the expression of CLEC-2 on DCs.

PDGF stimulated DCs induce T regulatory cells
We then investigated whether increased IL-10
secretion by DCs resulted in polarization of T helper cell
response towards a T regulatory phenotype. PDGF-DC
and unstimulated DCs were cultured with purified, CFSE
labeled naïve CD4 T cells for six days. IFN-γ secretion
from PDGF-DC-T co-culture was significantly (p <
0.05) lower and IL-10 secretion was significantly (p <
0.05) higher than that of unstimulated DC-T co-culture
(Figure 2A & 2B). The level of TGF-β in the supernatant
was below the limit of detection (data not shown). IL4, IL-5 levels were also comparable (data not shown).
Similar results were obtained with T cells cultured with
PDGF-treated PAM stimulated DCs (Figure 2C & 2D).
Staining of T cells with FoxP3, signature regulatory T
cell transcription factor revealed that PDGF stimulated
DC significantly enhanced the differentiation of T helper
cells towards Tregs verses the unstimulated DC (Figure
2E & 2F). The proliferation of CD4 cells was also
significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after culture with PDGFDCs as compared to unstimulated DCs (Figure 2G). PDGF
stimulated DC thus bias the T cell response towards a
regulatory phenotype.

CLEC-2 expression on DC induces T regulatory
cells
To confirm that expression of CLEC-2 was
responsible for regulatory nature of PDGF-DC,
unstimulated DCs were transfected with CLEC-2 plasmid
(gift from Dr. Steve Watson, University of Birmingham,
U.K.)[24] using magnetofection. This resulted in
significant expression of CLEC-2 on DCs 48h after
transfection (Figure 4A). CLEC-2 expressing DCs were
collected and cultured with T cells as described in Figure
2. Determination of cytokines in the supernatant revealed
that while the IFN-γ levels were comparable (Figure 4B),
IL-10 secretion was significantly increased in CLEC-2
DC-T co culture (Figure 4C). Moreover, culture of CLEC2 transfected DCs with T cells generated significantly
increased percent of Treg cells as compared to mock
transfected DCs (Figure 4D). Thus CLEC-2 expression in
DCs bestows the ability to induce the differentiation of
Tregs.

CLEC-2 expression on platelets also induces T
regulatory cells

was found to be optimal since the increasing the ratio to
5:1 did not result in significant increase over 2:1. T cells
cultured with Platelets also secreted high levels of TGF-β,
IL-10 compared to T cell cultured alone (Figure 5D). The
secretion of IFN-γ was concomitantly reduced. Culture of
platelet alone did not result in detectable level of these
cytokines (data not shown).
Next we determined the effect of platelets on antiCD3 and anti-CD28 bead activated T cells. Treg induction
(Figure 5E) and cytokine secretion (Figure 5F) results
were similar to that obtained with unactivated T cells. In
addition, we also measured proliferation. The proliferation
index of T cells was also significantly reduced (p < 0.05)
in the presence of platelets (Figure 5G).
Collectively, these results suggest that CLEC-2
expressing cells stimulate T cells to induce a T regulatory
phenotype.

Next we determined if CLEC-2 expression on APCs
such as DCs is required for inducing T regs or any cell
expressing CLEC-2 is capable of inducing the T regs.
Platelets in the blood naturally express CLEC-2 to interact
with endothelium [23, 25]. Therefore, we purified platelets
from the blood and confirmed the expression of CLEC2 on purified platelets (Figure 5A). The purified platelets
were cultured with syngeneic unactivated T cells and the
induction of T regs was determined. As shown in Figure
5B, culture of platelets with T cells resulted in significant
increase (p < 0.05) in CD4+CD25+CD127lo FoxP3+,
Tregs (Figure 5B & 5C). This increase was proportional
to the number of platelets. Platelet to T cell ratio of 2:1

0.05) in the T cells cultured with CLEC-2 protein (Figure
6D). IFN-γ secretion was very low; despite this, it was
reduced in CLEC-2 treated T cells (Figure 6D). These data
demonstrate that CLEC-2 protein by itself is sufficient to
induce Tregs.
Since CLEC-2 most likely interacted with
podoplanin on T cells, we determined whether crosslinking
of podoplanin on T cells using specific antibody also
resulted in induction of T regs. Indeed, as shown in Figure
6E, ligation of podoplanin on unactivated T cells resulted
in significantly increased (p < 0.05) induction of T regs
compared to T cells crosslinked with isotype specific
antibody. Similar to CLEC-2, podoplanin antibody
treatment of T cells also resulted in significantly increased
secretion of TGF-β and IL-10 with a concomitant
reduction IFN-γ Figure 6F).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that
CLEC-2 protein binds with podoplanin on T cells to
induce T reg cells.

The two known ligands for CLEC-2 are the
Podoplanin and snake venom rhodotoxin [23, 26]. Recent
studies have demonstrated that T cells express Podoplanin
in mice [27]. We confirmed the expression of Podoplanin
on human CD4 T cells (Figure 6A). Podoplanin was
expressed on naïve, central and effector memory subsets
with highest expression on effector memory subset. Next,
we determined whether purified, soluble CLEC-2 protein
can bind to T cells. Indeed, there was significant binding of
CLEC-2 on T cells (Figure 6B). Since CLEC-2 expression
on two very different cell types, DCs and platelets was
leading to the induction of Tregs, we investigated if the
protein itself was enough to generate Tregs or it requires
accessory signals from the cells. Purified T cells were
cultured with recombinant CLEC-2 and induction of
Tregs was determined. Addition of CLEC-2 alone
resulted in increase in Tregs (Figure 6C). The production
of TGF-β and IL-10 was also significantly higher (p <

DISCUSSION

cells, monocytes, dendritic cells and granulocytes [25,
33]. However, recent studies have reported the expression
of CLEC-2 on DCs in inflammatory conditions [34, 35]
where based on our observations, CLEC-2 may have a role
in suppressing inflammation.
Podoplanin, a sialoglycoprotein is the physiological
ligand for CLEC-2 [23, 25]. It is expressed on numerous
cell types including mesothelial cells, epithelial cells,
fibroblasts, follicular dendritic cells and various tumor
cells. In tumors, podoplanin is involved in tumor cellinduced platelet aggregation and tumor metastasis
[36]. Podoplanin is also expressed at high levels on the
endothelial cells and fibroblastic reticular cells of lymph
nodes where it plays a major in maintaining the high
endothelial venule integrity during immune response via
its binding with CLEC-2 on platelets[37]. Podoplanin-

Here we demonstrate that C-type lectin receptor;
CLEC-2 induces Tregs in soluble form as well as when
expressed on DCs and platelets.
CLEC-2 belongs to the family of C-type lectin
receptors (CLRs) which are a large family of carbohydrate
binding, Ca++ dependent receptors present on numerous
cells types [28]. CLEC-2 is a member of the “dectin-1
cluster” of CLRs and was originally thought to be restricted
to platelets. Recent studies document the expression of the
receptors in the ‘Dectin-1 cluster’ on myeloid populations
where they function in homeostasis and immunity [2832]. Initial studies suggested that surface expression
of CLEC-2 is restricted to platelets, although RT-PCR
analysis has shown transcripts in PBMC, bone marrow

potential to lead to the development of novel therapies
against tumors and autoimmunity.

CLEC-2 axis also controls the expansion and contraction
of lymph nodes during an immune response [30, 38].
CLEC-2 expression on DCs and its interaction with
podoplanin in fibroblastic reticular cells was also found
to be essential for migration of DCs to lymphatics and
trafficking within lymph nodes [29]. All these studies
have studied the interaction of CLEC-2 on DCs with
podoplanin on fibroblast reticular cells. There is a key
gap in knowledge about the effect of CLEC-2 expressing
DCs on T cells. Peters et al [27] recently demonstrated
that podoplanin is expressed on effector T cells during
autoimmune inflammation where it functions as an
inhibitory molecule promoting tolerance. Our results also
demonstrate that CLEC-2 binds to T cells (Figure 6B)
and ligation of podoplanin on T cells induces T reg cells
(Figure 6E-6F). Therefore, CLEC-2 may be inducing
Tregs via engagement of podoplanin on T cells.
Our discovery that PDGF can induce regulatory
DCs identifies novel approaches to generate regulatory or
tolerogenic DCs. Furthermore, our finding that CLEC-2
protein by itself and podoplanin antibody are capable of
inducing T regs identifies novel approaches for induction
of Tregs for immunotherapy against transplantation and
autoimmunity. Local infusion of CLEC-2 or podoplanin
antibody in autoimmune diseases such as Multiple
Sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis may prove useful in
suppressing inflammation. This is supported by the
fact that global deletion of podoplanin in mice resulted
in enhanced T cell responses as well as spontaneous
development of EAE [27]. Furthermore, podoplanin
expressed on Th17 cells in mice [27, 39, 40] inhibits the
long-term Th17 responses in the target organ by reducing
sensitivity to IL-7 survival signals, thereby preventing
tissue damage.
Our results also suggest a novel mechanism by
which platelets may be inducing immune suppression
and promoting tumor growth. The activation of platelets
releases PDGF which not only causes platelet aggregation
and angiogenesis but also induces tolerance in DCs via
induction of CLEC-2. PDGF is also known to upregulate
the expression of CLEC-2 on platelets. Both these cells
together enhance the induction of Tregs in the tumor
microenvironment. Our observations suggest novel targets
for treatment of tumors. Inhibitors of CLEC-2 which
prevent the binding of of CLEC-2 with podoplanin on T
cells may prove useful in reducing immunosuppression
in tumor microenvironment. However, such therapies
would require careful design so that the effect is specific
to tumors and does not induce other physiological
interactions of CLEC-2. In this regard, Kato et al have
recently reported the development of a podoplanin
antibody which specifically recognizes podoplanin on
tumor cells and not on endothelial cells [41].
To our knowledge this the first report of CLEC-2
expression of DCs and its binding with podoplanin on T
cells in humans. As mentioned, this knowledge has the

Blood samples were obtained from healthy
volunteers via Institute for Clinical and Translational
Science (ICTS), UC Irvine. This study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
California (Irvine, CA).

Culture and stimulation of human monocytederived DCs
Monocyte derived DCs were prepared as described
before by culturing the purified monocytes with GMCSF
and IL-4. DCs (CD14-HLA-DR+CD11c+ cells) were
collected after 6 days [32]. Serum free, AIM V media
was used for culture. The purity of the DCs was >95% as
determined by the expression of CD14, CD11c and HLADR. DCs collected were stimulated with recombinant
PDGF-AB (Peprotech, NJ) at a concentration ranging
from 1-100ng/ml. 48h later supernatant was collected and
stored at -70°C until analyzed. In experiments with PAM,
DCs were treated with PDGF for 24h and subsequently
stimulated overnight with PAM 3 Cys (Invivogen) at a
concentration of 10µg/ml. Cytokines, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α,
CXCL-8, MCP-1, CXCL-10 in the supernatants was
measured by multiplex cytokine assay (eBiosciences, CA)
as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Control and PDGF-stimulated DCs (PDGFDC) were analyzed for the expression of CD40, CD80,
CD86, CD83, PDL-1, B7DC, B7Rh and HLADR (BD
Bioscience) using Flow jo (Treestar Inc).

Allogeneic DC-T cell co-cultures
PDGF-stimulated and unstimulated DCs were
cultured with magnetic bead purified (StemCell,
Vancouver, Canada), allogeneic T cells at a ratio of
1:10. After 6 days of incubation, the supernatant was
collected and the secretion of TGF-β, IL-5, IL-4, IFN-γ,
IL-10, (BD Bioscience) was assessed using ELISA.
Subsequently, the cells were collected and stained
with antibodies for CD4, CD25, CD127 and FoxP3 to
stain for Tregs. CD4+CD25+CD127lo gated cells were
analyzed for the expression of FoxP3. In some assays to
measure proliferation, T cells were labeled with CFSE
and proliferation was measured by flow cytometry as
described [42].

Podoplanin staining on CD4 T cells

DCs and PDGF-DCs were generated as described
above. RNA was extracted from DC and corresponding
PDGF-DC from 3 different subjects using TRI reagent
as in the past [43]. Affymetrix gene array (Human gene
1.0ST array) was performed by UCI genomics high
throughput facility as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Genearray data was analyzed by Genesifter.

PBMCs were stained with CD4, CD45RA and CCR7
antibodies to identify naïve (CD4+CD45RA+CCR7+),
central memory (CD4+CD45RA-CCR7+) and effector
memory (CD4+CD45RA-CCR7-) subsets. Podoplanin was
stained using a specific antibody from Biolegend, San
Diego, CA.

T reg induction by recombinant CLEC-2 protein
and podoplanin crosslinking

CLEC-2 transfection and staining
CLEC-2 plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Steve
Watson U.K[24]. CLEC-2 was transfected into immature
DCs using CombiMag Magnetofection (Chemicell, Berlin,
Germany) kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Magnetofection™ is a novel, simple and highly efficient
method to transfect cells in culture. It exploits magnetic
force exerted upon gene vectors associated with magnetic
particles to draw the vectors into the target cells. In this
manner, the full vector dose applied gets concentrated on
the cells within a few minutes so that 100% of the cells get
in contact with a significant vector dose. Briefly, immature
DCs were derived from monocytes. 5x105 DCs were
added/ well of a 24 well plate. Non-adherent cell protocol
for CombiMag was used. Transfection reagent was Roche
XtremeGENE.
Expression of CLEC-2 was determined 48h after
transfection using specific antibody (RnD systems)
followed by FITC conjugated second antibody.

described above were cultured with recombinant CLEC2 protein (RnD systems) at 1µg/ml for 96h. T cells were
stained for T regs as described. Supernatants collected
were assayed for IL-10, IFN-γ and TGF-β.
Purified T cells were cultured with Podoplanin
antibody (1µg/ml) or isotype control for 1 h and
subsequently crosslinked with secondary anti-rat antibody.
96h later T cells were stained for T regs as described.
Supernatants collected were assayed for IL-10, IFN-γ and
TGF-β.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad
Prism. Within group differences between unstimulated
and stimulated conditions were tested using paired t-tests.
Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.

Platelet and T cell co-cultures

Acknowledgments

Platelets were purified from whole blood using the
protocol described [44]. Briefly blood was centrifuged at
200 x g or 15min at room temperature to obtain plateletrich plasma. To obtain a platelet pellet, the collected
plasma was centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min at RT. The
pellet was suspended in AIM V. T cells were purified from
the same donor using magnetic beads as described above.
Platelets and T cells were cultured at ratios ranging from
1:1 to 1:5 for 72h. Subsequently, the cells were collected
and stained for CD4, CD25, CD127 and FoxP3 to stain
for T regulatory cells as for DCs. The supernatant was
collected was assayed for TGF-β, IFN-γ, IL-10 by ELISA.
Experiments were also performed where platelets
were cultured with activated T cells. anti-CD3 and antiCD28 coated Dynabeads (Invitrogen, CA) were used for T
cell activation [45]. For proliferation measurements CFSE
labeled T cells were used.
