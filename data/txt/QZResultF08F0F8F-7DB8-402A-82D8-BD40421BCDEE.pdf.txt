Abstract
The ability of tumor cells to avoid immune destruction (immune escape) as well
as their acquired resistance to anti-cancer drugs constitute important barriers to
the successful management of cancer. Interaction between the Programmed Death
Ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of tumor cells with the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1)
receptor on cytotoxic T lymphocytes leads to inactivation of these immune effectors
and, consequently, immune escape. Here we show that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis also
leads to tumor cell resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Using a
panel of PD-L1-expressing human and mouse breast and prostate cancer cell lines, we
found that incubation of breast and prostate cancer cells in the presence of purified
recombinant PD-1 resulted in resistance to doxorubicin and docetaxel as determined
using clonogenic survival assays. Co-culture with PD-1-expressing Jurkat T cells also
promoted chemoresistance and this was prevented by antibody blockade of either
PD-L1 or PD-1 or by silencing of the PD-L1 gene. Moreover, inhibition of the PD-1/
PD-L1 axis using anti-PD-1 antibody enhanced doxorubicin chemotherapy to inhibit
metastasis in a syngeneic mammary orthotopic mouse model of metastatic breast
cancer. To further investigate the mechanism of tumor cell survival advantage upon
PD-L1 ligation, we show that exposure to rPD-1 promoted ERK and mTOR growth and
survival pathways leading to increased cell proliferation. Overall, the findings of this
study indicate that combinations of chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade
may limit chemoresistance and progression to metastatic disease.

Introduction

amplitude of immune responses, primarily through the
inhibition of adaptive T cell responses [2]. Tumor cells
co-opt the PD-1/PD-L1 mechanism of immune regulation
such that activation of this axis results in suppression
of anti-tumor adaptive responses through mechanisms
involving induction of CTL anergy, exhaustion, apoptosis
and decreased cytokine production [1, 3]. In addition to
interfering with CTL function, engagement of PD-1 with
PD-L1 increases tumor cell resistance to pro-apoptotic
signals including those delivered by cytotoxic immune
effectors, staurosporin, and Fas ligation [4]; however,
the specific mechanism through which this occurs has
not been elucidated. Most solid tumours express PD-L1

The ability of tumor cells to avoid immune
destruction (immune escape), as well as their acquired
resistance to anti-cancer drugs, constitute key barriers
to the successful management of cancer. An important
mechanism of cancer immune escape involves interaction
between the Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) receptor on
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) with the Programmed
Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) on cancer cells or other host
immune cells. [1]. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is one of several
“immune checkpoint regulators” that have physiological
roles in self-tolerance and in limiting the duration and

at various levels and local factors and molecules, such as
interferon gamma (IFNγ), stimulate PD-L1 expression [3,
5]. PD-L1 has emerged as a valuable prognostic marker
and several studies have correlated PD-L1 expression
with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) [6], high
histological grade [7] and poor overall survival [8].
Current strategies designed to interfere with PD-1/PDL1 signaling through the use of humanized monoclonal
antibodies (e.g. Nivolumab) have shown robust clinical
responses in patients with heavily-pre-treated advanced
cancers such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer,
and renal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, there is evidence
of PD-1/PD-L1-mediated resistance to radiotherapy and
anti-CTLA-4 antibody immunotherapy [9], suggesting that
PD-1/PD-L1 axis may serve as a pro-survival mechanism
for tumour cells. There is evidence that response to PD-1/
PD-L1 blockade therapy is at least partly dependent on the
levels of tumor PD-L1 protein [10, 11].
Based on the knowledge that PD-L1 expression
protects tumor cells from pro-apoptotic agents [12], and
that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is correlated with negative

patient outcomes [8], we postulated that the PD-1/PDL1 axis also contributes to the acquisition of resistance
to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Here we show
that the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 increases
breast and prostate cancer cell resistance to doxorubicin
and docetaxel in vitro and that inhibition of the PD-1/
PD-L1 axis using targeted therapy against PD-1 enhances
the effect of conventional chemotherapy to attenuate
metastasis in an in vivo model of mammary carcinoma.

Results
PD-1/PD-L1 interaction increased clonogenic
survival in tumor cells following exposure to
chemotherapeutic agents
To investigate the contribution of the PD-1/PD-L1
axis to drug resistance in tumor cells we incubated MDAMB-231, 4T1 and DU145 cells with rPD-1 for 24 h prior

to exposure to doxorubicin or docetaxel. We observed
increased survival in all cell lines when exposed to rPD1 prior to doxorubicin (MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells) or
docetaxel (DU145 cells) (Figure 1A, p < 0.05). To assess
whether the specific interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1
mediates the observed drug resistance, we blocked PD-L1
using a monoclonal antibody prior to exposure to rPD1 and subsequent treatment with the chemotherapeutic
agent. This resulted in complete inhibition of rPD-1mediated chemoresistance (Figure 1B, p < 0.0001).
Furthermore, stable knockdown of PD-L1 expression
using human PD-L1-specific or murine PD-L1-specific
shRNA prevented the rPD-1-mediated acquisition of

resistance to doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells and 4T1
cells (Figure 1C and 1D). Interestingly, MDA-MB-231
and 4T1 cells expressing PD-L1-specific shRNA in the
absence of PD-1 were intrinsically more resistant to
doxorubicin than their non-targeting shRNA-expressing
counterparts. However, the results from the knockdown
experiments support the conclusion that the interaction
between PD-1 and PD-L1 mediates chemoresistance.
To model a more physiological system, we cocultured MDA-MB-231 cells or DU145 cells with PD-1expressing Jurkat T cells [13] for 24 h prior to exposure
to doxorubicin. Results from these experiments revealed
an increase in drug resistance when tumor cells were

exposed to Jurkat cells (Figure 2A, 2B, 2C p < 0.0001).
Furthermore, inclusion of blocking anti-PD-L1 or antiPD-1 antibody (Figure 2A, 2B) or transient knockdown of
PD-L1 expression using siRNA (Figure 2C) prevented the
T cell-mediated acquisition of resistance to doxorubicin in
MDA-MB-231 and DU145 cells.
IFNγ is a known inducer of PD-L1 expression in
various cell types, including mammary carcinoma cells [5]
and is often present in the tumor microenvironment. To
determine whether the extent of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions
is associated with the size of the surviving fraction
following exposure to anti-cancer drugs we increased the
expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells using IFNγ. We then
exposed the tumor cells to a low (0.2 µg/ml) or high (1.0
µg/ml) concentration of rPD-1 for 24 h (Figure 2D) and
subsequently exposed them to doxorubicin for 1 h. Preincubation of cells with IFNγ resulted in increased PDL1 expression (Supplementary Figure 1A) and enhanced
the effect of rPD-1 on resistance to doxorubicin in MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 2D, p < 0.0001). Specifically, cells
incubated with IFNγ and exposed to 1 µg/ml of rPD-1
exhibited a 33% increase in survival compared to IFNγstimulated cells exposed to 0.2 µg/ml of rPD-1 (p <
0.0001). These results provide evidence that the proportion
of cells surviving exposure to doxorubicin correlates with
the extent of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions.
Interestingly, exposure to IFNγ alone resulted
in increased resistance to doxorubicin (Figure 2D, p <
0.001). This effect was not limited to MDA-MB-231 cells,
as it was also observed when 4T1 and DU145 cells were
treated with IFNγ (data not shown).

compared to mice that received IgG and saline (Figure 4).
To determine if anti-PD-1-antibody-mediated attenuation
of chemoresistance was immune-cell specific, a similar
experiment was conducted using Rag2-/-γc-/- mice deficient
in T cells, B cells and NK cells. We did not observe a
significant difference in the total number of organ-specific
metastases between the treatment groups (Figure 3B).
This lack of effect of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in
these immunodeficient mice supports the concept that
the chemosensitizing effect of the anti-PD-1 antibody is
mediated by immune cells.
Though we did not observe a statistically significant
reduction in primary tumor volume in the Balb/c mouse
model, combination treatment revealed a trend towards
and a smaller final tumor volume (Supplementary
Figure 1B, p = 0.069) and decreasing tumor growth
(Supplementary Figure 2C; p = 0.055)

Exposure to PD-1 increased ERK and mTOR
phosphorylation and tumor cell proliferation
To dissect the molecular mechanisms linking PD-1
binding to PD-L1 on tumor cells, we treated MDAMB-231 cells with rPD-1 and assessed ERK and mTOR
survival pathways. Western blot analysis revealed ERK
activation that was sustained for up to 60 min (Figure
5A). Similar results were observed for mTOR activation
(Figure 5B). Furthermore, exposure to rPD-1 for 24 h
resulted in a significant increase in proliferation in both
MDA-MB-231 and DU145 cells as determined using a
cell proliferation assay (Figure 5C).

Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment combined with
doxorubicin resulted in decreased metastasis in
mice bearing 4T1 mammary tumors

DISCUSSION
This investigation sought to determine the role of
the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in the acquisition of resistance to
doxorubicin and docetaxel in breast and prostate cancer
models, respectively. In vivo and in vitro findings using
human and murine cell lines and two distinct murine
models of metastatic breast cancer support the concept
that tumor cells may co-opt the host’s immune system
to acquire resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics.
These findings reveal a potential for currently available
immune checkpoint blockade approaches specifically
designed to interfere with the PD-1/PD-L1 axis to be used
as adjuvants to chemotherapy.
A recent publication by Noh et al. revealed that
co-culture of PD-L1-expressing B16F10 melanoma
cells with bone marrow-derived cells results in a smaller
proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis/necrosis
following gemcitabine treatment [14]; however that study
did not assess the contribution of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis
specifically. Our study demonstrated that independently
blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 resulted in inhibition of PD1-mediated chemoresistance to a similar extent, and

To determine the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in
chemoresistance in vivo, we employed an established
mouse model of metastatic mammary carcinoma using
GFP-tagged 4T1 cells. Mice treated with blocking antiPD-1 antibody in combination with doxorubicin had
a significantly reduced number of metastases (liver,
lungs, heart, spleen, kidneys and posterior abdominal
wall combined) than those treated with anti-PD-1
antibody or doxorubicin alone (p < 0.05; Figure 3A,
top). Furthermore, combined treatment with anti-PD-1
antibody + doxorubicin resulted in a significantly reduced
number of lung and heart metastases when compared with
treatment with doxorubicin alone (p < 0.05; Figure 3A,
middle & bottom). Interestingly, treatment of mice with
anti-PD-1 antibody alone did not have a significant effect
on metastasis. Though metastatic lesions were quantified
using fluorescence image analysis, histological analysis
also revealed that mice receiving combination anti-PD-1
and doxorubicin treatment had fewer Ki67+ nuclei when

experiments using stable knockdown of PD-L1 expression
abolished rPD-1-mediated chemoresistance. The use
of distinct human and murine PD-L1 shRNA as well as
human PD-L1 siRNA resulting in similar inhibition of
PD-1/PD-L1-mediated drug resistance indicates that the
effect of PD-L1 knockdown was not gene-constructspecific. Furthermore, using an immunodeficient Rag2-/γc-/- murine model of breast cancer lacking the major PD-1
expressing immune cells (T, B and NK cells), our study
showed that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis using PD-1
blocking antibodies in combination with doxorubicin
had no effect on the number of metastases, highlighting
the essential role of immune cells in the acquisition of
chemoresistance. Due to the immunodeficient nature
of the Rag2-/-γc-/- mice, tumor progression occurred at
a faster rate than in the Balb/c immunocompetent mice
and not all mice were able to complete the four cycles of
treatment. However, taken together, these findings reveal
for the first time that specific PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are
at least partly responsible for resistance to doxorubicin
and docetaxel. Furthermore, our results indicate that
interactions between PD-1 or PD-L1 and other ligands

(e.g. PD-L2 and B7.1) are unlikely to play a role in the
drug resistance phenotype.
Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism by
which tumor cells acquire resistance to conventional
chemotherapeutics upon engagement of the PD-1/PDL1 axis and strengthen the rationale for combination
chemotherapy/immunotherapy in the clinical setting. Due
to the correlation between PD-L1 expression and response
to anti-PD-1 treatment [15], most clinical trials are
currently focusing on treating cancers known to express
high levels of PD-L1 such as melanoma and non-small
cell lung cancer [16]. Our in vivo data show that although
PD-1 blockade or doxorubicin alone did not affect primary
tumor growth and metastasis, the combination of these
two modalities significantly reduced the overall and organspecific (lung and heart) number of 4T1 metastases. A
lack of effect of PD-1 blockade alone on metastasis using
this model may be due to differences in the PD-1/PD-L1
signaling threshold required for drug resistance versus
immune escape. Alternatively, the synergy observed with
combination anti-PD-1 + doxorubicin therapy may be
a consequence of chemotherapy-induced immune cell

stimulation and tumor antigen release [17]. In the presence
of anti-PD-1 antibody, these tumor-specific antigens may
be able to promote an effective CTL-mediated anti-tumor
immune response.
A study by Azuma et al. demonstrated resistance to
pro-apoptotic signals in tumor cells following engagement
of PD-1 with PD-L1 [4]; however, that study did not
reveal a role for major anti-apoptotic and apoptotic
pathways in this process. In an effort to determine the
mechanism responsible for PD-1/PD-L1-mediated
chemoresistance, we explored a potential role of known
cell survival molecules. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and
RAS/PI3K/PTEN/mTOR signal transduction pathways are
well known regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis
which ultimately lead to drug resistance in various
cancers including breast [18-20], hematopoietic [21, 22]
and liver [23] cancers. Our study revealed a significant
increase in ERK and mTOR phosphorylation as well as
cellular proliferation in response to rPD-1. These findings
indicate that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis may initiate protumorigenic signals leading to chemoresistance. In vitro
activation of pro-tumorigenic pathways and an increase
in cell proliferation following tumor cell exposure to rPD1 corroborate our in-vivo findings showing blockade of
PD-1/PD-L1 interaction resulted in reduced Ki67 staining
in metastases. Further investigation into how these signals
function to promote cell survival is required in order to
effectively target PD-1/PD-L1-mediated drug resistance.
The findings of this study indicate that immune
checkpoint blockade approaches designed to target
the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in cancer patients may be of
further therapeutic benefit when used in combination
with conventional chemotherapy. The complex tumor
microenvironment (TME) composed of immune, stromal
and vascular cells and their associated cytokines influence
tumor growth and malignant progression. While this study
attempted to mimic certain aspects of the TME through
the incorporation of T cells and IFNγ, other factors,
such as hypoxia could also affect PD-1/PD-L1-mediated
chemoresistance. A previous study from our laboratory
demonstrated that hypoxia induces PD-L1 expression
in tumor cells in a HIF-1α-dependent manner [13]. It
is also well known that hypoxia and HIF-1 contribute
to the acquisition of drug resistance in cancer cells
independently of PD-1 [24, 25]. Therefore, the present
study provides evidence of an alternative mechanism
by which hypoxia could indirectly contribute to drug
resistance in cancer cells. Overall, our findings indicate
that, in addition to being an effective immune checkpoint
blockade strategy, inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis may
be a novel approach to decrease drug resistance in cancer
and, therefore, improve the efficacy of chemotherapy.

Cell lines
Human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells,
DU145 prostate cancer cells and Jurkat T cell leukemia
cells were obtained from The American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and used for the in vitro experiments.
Mouse 4T1 breast carcinoma cells were obtained from
ATCC and used for both in vitro and in vivo experiments.
All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Invitrogen #11875-119) supplemented with either 10%
(MDA-MB-231 cells, 4T1 cells and Jurkat cells) or 5%
(DU145 cells) fetal bovine serum (Sigma #F6178). The
authenticity of these cell lines has not been verified in the
last six months. Cells were maintained under standard
culture conditions (37ºC in 20% O2 and 5% CO2).

Transient and stable PD-L1 knockdown
Transient knockdown of human PD-L1 expression
was achieved using Silencer® Select siRNA #s26547
(Ambion Inc.). Silencer® Negative Control siRNA #2
(Ambion Inc.) was used as control. The siRNA (25 nM
final concentration) was introduced into cells using
siPORT NeoFx reagent (Ambion Inc.) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Treatments with siRNA were
performed 24 h prior to incubation in hypoxia or standard
conditions.
We used a lentiviral transfection system consisting
of GFP-expressing PD-L1 specific short-hairpin RNA
(shRNA) (Open Bioscience; mouse #V2LMM_71093,
human #V2LHS_53668) to achieve stable PD-L1
knockdown (Supplementary Figure 1). A non-targeting
equivalent vector was used as a control (Open Bioscience).
Cells that incorporated the cDNA vector were selected in
puromycin-containing medium (2-10 µg/ml; Invitrogen
#A1113803). PD-L1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells
and 4T1 cells was confirmed by immunoblot (R&D
Systems #AF156) or flow cytometry (R&D Systems
#FAB1019F), respectively (Supplementary Figure 1A
and 1B), as described previously [13]. Briefly, 293T cells
were transfected with the desired lentiviral plasmid along
with psPAx2 (packaging- Gag Pol Rev proteins) and

overnight. Cells were cultured in fresh medium for 48 h
before the medium was collected and filtered. Target cells
(MDA-MB-231 or 4T1) were seeded in six-well plates at
50,000 cells/well and a dilution series was used to infect
the cells. After 48 h, cells underwent puromycin (2-10 µg/
ml) selection for 4-5 days. GFP-expression was assessed
during the selection period using a UV microscope.

For immunoblot analysis, plates of MBA-MB-231
cells stimulated with rPD-1 (1 µg/ml) were rinsed
with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer containing
the inhibitors leupeptin (10 µg/ml), aprotinin (10 µg/
ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), sodium
orthovanadate (1 mM), and sodium fluoride (10 µM).
Equal amounts of protein from whole cell lysates were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF
membrane using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system
(BioRad). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk
in TBST for one hour at room temperature and incubated
overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: antipSer2448 mTor, anti-mTor (Cell Signaling Technology),
and anti-pErk1/2 and anti-Erk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
All antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in TBST. Membranes
were washed three times with TBST and incubated
with anti-mouse and rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies (LI-COR), diluted to 1:25,000 in TBST for one
hour at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized
using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate and
quantified using a C-digit Blot Scanner (LI-COR).

Stimulation of PD-L1 expression
To stimulate PD-L1 expression, tumour cells
were incubated with human IFNγ (10 ng/ml; human,
eBioscience #14-8319-80) for 24 or 48 h. PD-L1 upregulation on human MDA-MB-231 cells after incubation
with IFNγ was confirmed by Western blot analysis as we
previously reported [13] (Supplementary Figure 1A).

Exposure to PD-1
MDA-MB-231, DU145 and 4T1 cells were
incubated with recombinant PD-1 (rPD-1; R&D Systems;
human: #1086-PD; mouse: #1021-PD) in serum-free
medium for 24 h prior to exposure to chemotherapeutic
agents and subsequent clonogenic assays. Alternatively,
MDA-MB-231 or DU145 cells were co-cultured with
human Jurkat T cells for 24 h in a 1:5 ratio. Jurkat cells
were stimulated with IL-2 (100U; Sigma, #17908-10KU)
prior to co-culture in order to induce activation and
stimulate PD-1 expression as previously reported [26].
We have shown that > 90% of Jurkat T cells express
PD-1 [13]. In some experiments, we blocked PD-1/PD-L1
interaction with either human anti-PD-L1 antibody (4 µg/
ml; Biolegend #329702) or anti-PD-1 antibody (1 µg/ml;
R&D Systems #AF1086) prior to exposure to rPD-1 or
Jurkat T cells and doxorubicin.

Proliferation assay
The effect of rPD-1 on tumor cell proliferation was
assessed using the WST reagent. Briefly, cells cultured in
96-well plates were incubated for 24 h in the absence or
presence of rPD-1 (0.2 and 10 µg/ml). Two hours before
the end of the incubation period, 10 µl of the WST reagent
was added to each well according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Absorbance was
measured at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader.

Mouse mammary carcinoma models of metastasis

Clonogenic (colony formation) assay

Female Balb/c mice (Charles River) were inoculated
with a single orthotopic injection of 3.5 x 103 GFPexpressing 4T1 cells into the lower left mammary fat pad.
Once tumours were palpable (about 10 days following
tumor cell inoculation), mice were treated twice a week
for 15 days with either mouse anti-PD-1 antibody (n =
12; 200 µg in 100 µL; Pharmacia Biotech) or control
anti-hamster IgG (n = 11; Jackson Immunoresearch)
delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Twenty-four hours after
each antibody injection, mice received either doxorubicin
(n = 12; 5 mg/kg; Sigma #D1515) or the equivalent
volume of saline (n = 11;) i.p. One mouse did not develop
a primary tumour and therefore was excluded from the
study. Tumor dimensions were measured after each
antibody treatment using digital calipers and volumes
were calculated using the formula (length x width)2 x 0.5.
Overall, mice received four treatment cycles of anti-PD-1

Clonogenic assays were performed to determine the
effect of PD-1/PD-L1 on tumor cell survival following
drug exposure as described previously [27]. Tumor cells
(50,000 - 100,000) were plated in six-well plates and
after various manipulations of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, were
incubated with either doxorubicin (6.25 µM and 12.5 µM
for MDA-MB-231; 2.5 µM for 4T1; 6.25 µM for DU145;
Sigma #D1515-10MG) or docetaxel (1.6 µM; Sigma
#Y0001133) for 1 hr. Drug concentrations were established
such that similar surviving fractions were observed across
all cell lines and drug types (approximately 0.01). Colony
formation assays were performed and scored 7-14 days
following plating.

conflicts of interest

Ab or IgG ± doxorubicin/saline throughout the duration
of the experiment. On day 15 (experimental endpoint),
mice were euthanized and the primary tumour, heart,
lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys were excised and analyzed
using a Pan-A-See-Ya Panorama biophotonics imaging
system (Lighttools Research) followed by image analysis
using ImagePro 6.1 software (Media Cybernetics).
Primary tumors and lungs from tumor-bearing Balb/c
mice were also fixed in formalin and processed for
immunohistochemistry using a rabbit polyclonal antiKi67 antibody (Abcam ab15580; 1:1,000) in order to
localize proliferating cells. Sections were stained using
the Discovery XR Staining System (Ventana Medical
Systems, Inc.). Staining was visualized using DAB
followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Sections
were scanned on an Aperio CS digital slide scanner (Leica
Biosystems) and images were captured using Aperio
Spectrum software (Leica Biosystems).
To determine a potential role of PD-1-expressing
lymphocytes in PD-1/PD-L1-mediated chemoresistance
in vivo we adopted the 4T1 mammary carcinoma model
described above using mice lacking T, B, and NK cells.
Alymphoid female Rag2-/-γc-/- mice (provided by Dr. C.
Tayade, Queen’s University) were inoculated as above
with GFP-expressing 4T1 cells. After tumours were
palpable (7-10 days following tumor cell inoculation),
mice were treated twice a week for up to 15 days with
either mouse anti-PD-1 antibody (n = 10) or control antihamster IgG (n = 10) in combination with doxorubicin
or saline as described above. Mice were euthanized
upon reaching humane endpoints or on day 15 after
receiving four rounds of treatment. Because of their
immunodeficient nature, a few mice reached humane
endpoints prior to completion of the four rounds of
treatment (see Supplementary Table 3 for details). Organ
metastases were analyzed as described above.

None of the authors declare any potential conflict
of interest.
