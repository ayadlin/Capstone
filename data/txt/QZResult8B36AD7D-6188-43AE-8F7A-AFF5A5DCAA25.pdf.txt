ABSTRACT
Treatment of HER2+ breast cancer with trastuzumab is effective and combination
anti-HER2 therapies have demonstrated benefit over monotherapy in the neoadjuvant
and metastatic settings. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting
the BAG-1 protein co-chaperone in trastuzumab-responsive or -resistant cells. In the
METABRIC dataset, BAG-1 mRNA was significantly elevated in HER2+ breast tumors
and predicted overall survival in a multivariate analysis (HR = 0.81; p = 0.022). In a
breast cell line panel, BAG-1 protein was increased in HER2+ cells and was required for
optimal growth as shown by siRNA knockdown. Overexpression of BAG-1S in HER2+
SKBR3 cells blocked growth inhibition by trastuzumab, whereas overexpression of a
mutant BAG-1S protein (BAG-1S H3AB), defective in binding HSC70, potentiated the
effect of trastuzumab. Injection of a Tet-On SKBR3 clone, induced to overexpress
myc-BAG-1S into the mammary fat pads of immunocompromised mice, resulted
in 2-fold larger tumors compared to uninduced controls. Induction of myc-BAG-1S
expression in two Tet-On SKBR3 clones attenuated growth inhibition by trastuzumab
in vitro. Targeting endogenous BAG-1 by siRNA enhanced growth inhibition of SKBR3
and BT474 cells by trastuzumab, while BAG-1 protein-protein interaction inhibitor
(Thio-S or Thio-2) plus trastuzumab combination treatment synergistically attenuated
growth. In BT474 cells this reduced protein synthesis, caused G1/S cell cycle arrest
and targeted the ERK and AKT signaling pathways. In a SKBR3 subpopulation with
acquired resistance to trastuzumab BAG-1 targeting remained effective and either
Thio-2 or BAG-1 siRNA reduced growth more compared to trastuzumab-responsive
parental cells. In summary, targeting BAG-1 function in combination with antiHER2 therapy might prove beneficial.

INTRODUCTION

influences cellular function through its interaction with
diverse molecular targets including Bcl-2 [21], Hsc70/
Hsp70 chaperones [22], ER [14] and RAF-1 [23], a key
downstream component of the HER2 signaling pathway.
Although the significance of BAG-1 as a biomarker
in ER+ breast cancer is recognized, little is known about
the role of BAG-1 in HER2+ disease. BAG-1 protein
levels are increased in some HER2+ breast cancer cell
lines [10, 24], while HER2 gene transfer in MCF7 cells
increases expression levels of BAG-1 and its interacting
partner Bcl-2 [25,  26]. Proof-of-principle studies
from our laboratory show that it is possible to restrict
breast cancer cell growth by targeting BAG-1 proteinprotein interactions using synthetic peptides and small
molecule compounds, like Thioflavin S (Thio-S) and
its biologically potent constituent Thio-2 [27–29]. Our
investigation adopted a multipronged strategy comprising
overexpression, RNA interference, and protein-protein
interaction inhibitors of BAG-1  to examine BAG-1
function in HER2+ breast cancer cells and to explore
whether combination of BAG-1-targeted therapies with
trastuzumab could restrict growth of these cells more
effectively than trastuzumab monotherapy.

Amplification of the human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene occurs in 15%–30% of
breast cancers and results in high levels of HER2 protein
expression [1]. This is accompanied by increased HER2
signaling and promotes malignant cell growth and survival
[2]. Therefore, patients whose tumors are characterized
by HER2 gene amplification and protein overexpression
develop a more aggressive type of cancer, which is
associated with poor prognosis [3]. The humanized
antibody trastuzumab, which targets the extracellular
domain of the HER2 receptor, can prolong overall survival
when used as a single agent [4] or when combined with
chemotherapy [5]. However, 74% of patients with
HER2+ metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab
monotherapy and about 50% of patients treated with
a combination of trastuzumab with anthracycline and
cyclophosphamide exhibit de novo resistance [5].
Moreover, although combination of trastuzumab with
chemotherapy has significantly improved disease-free
survival and overall survival in patients with early-stage
HER2+ breast cancer, in the metastatic setting acquired
resistance occurs within a year of initial treatment [6].
Treatment of patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer
with trastuzumab plus lapatinib (EGF104900) provides
overall survival advantage over lapatinib monotherapy
[7]. Moreover, in the neoadjuvant setting treatment
with trastuzumab plus lapatinib (Neo-ALTTO) [8] and
trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (Neosphere) [9] results in
improved pathological complete response. These data
suggest that combination targeted therapies have great
potential.
The co-chaperone protein Bcl-2-associated
athanogene 1 (BAG-1) exists as three main isoforms
BAG-1S, BAG-1M, and BAG-1L and is frequently
overexpressed in breast cancer and preinvasive breast
disease [10–13]. Clinical studies show that increased
BAG-1 immunoreactivity is an independent predictor
of outcome particularly in node-positive patients with
oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer receiving
adjuvant hormonal therapy alone and enhances the
predictive power of IHC4 score (a combination of
prognostic information derived from ER, PgR, Ki67,
and HER2 immunohistochemical staining) [14–16].
Furthermore, BAG-1 mRNA has been incorporated as a
prognostic biomarker in Oncotype DX [17] and PAM50
[18] multigene assays. In breast xenograft studies, BAG1 overexpression drives growth of oestrogen-responsive
ZR-75–1 breast cancer cells in an oestrogen-dependent
manner [19]. At a cellular level BAG-1 can promote
cancer progression which is characterized by evasion of
apoptosis, through the emergence of chemo-resistance
[20] and self-sufficiency in growth signals, as shown
by growth-factor independent survival [19]. BAG-1

RESULTS
BAG-1 mRNA and breast cancer outcome
As expression of BAG-1 protein is frequently
increased in breast cancer [12,  14,  15,  30,  31], we
examined whether an association might exist between
BAG-1 mRNA levels and disease outcome. Oncomine™
(Compendia Bioscience, Ann Arbor, MI) was used
to analyze BAG-1 gene expression in the Molecular
Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium
(METABRIC) dataset [32], comprising 1971 patients
of which there were 506  deaths due to breast cancer.
An unbiased estimation of the optimal cutpoint between
patients whose tumors express BAG-1 at high and at
low levels was performed using X-tile software [33].
Statistical significance for death from disease was
determined using Kaplan-Meier (log-rank test) univariate
analysis (Figure  1). High BAG-1  mRNA expression
was significantly associated (p = 0.001) with improved
prognosis in line with findings from other patient cohorts
[15]. Furthermore, high BAG-1 expression remained an
independent prognostic predictor (p =  0.022) of death
from breast cancer in a multivariate model comprising
standard clinicopathological variables (Table 1).

BAG-1 expression in HER2+ breast cancer cells
Amplification of HER2 is associated with poor
prognosis in breast cancer [3]. To examine the association
between BAG-1 gene expression and HER2 status the
18852

METABRIC dataset was analyzed. Data revealed that
BAG-1  mRNA was significantly increased in HER2+/
ER+ and HER2+/ER- tumors compared to normal breast
tissue (Figure  2A). Survival data for HER2 positive
tumours was not analyzed as a separate subgroup as we
felt that the number of patients in the HER2 positive
subset would not have been sufficient to achieve adequate
statistical power for this analysis. We next examined
BAG-1 protein immunoreactivity in a panel of breast
cancer cell lines representing distinct disease subtypes
and in non-tumorigenic MCF10A mammary epithelial
cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that BAG-1 protein
isoforms were present in all cell lines examined and
densitometric analysis revealed that total BAG-1 levels
were higher in HER2-overexpressing cells (Figure 2B),
in concordance with the METABRIC patient data
(Figure 2A). To determine the functional significance of
BAG-1 expression in breast cancer, the effect of BAG-1
knockdown by siRNA (siBAG-1) on cell growth was
examined in the breast cancer cell line panel. Robust
knockdown of BAG-1 protein isoforms was achieved
(72%–86%; Figure  2C) and was sustained for at least
8  days post-transfection (data not shown). Following
siBAG-1  treatment, growth of HER2-overexpressing
MDA-MB-453  was slightly reduced, while that of

SKBR3 and BT474 was significantly reduced compared
to siRNA nonsense control sequences (NSC) (Figure 2C).
Moreover, growth of ER+ T47D cells was significantly
reduced, while there was a small but not significant
reduction in the growth of MCF7 cells. Triple negative
CAL51 and MCF10A non-tumorigenic cells remained
unaffected (Figure 2C). Under these conditions, growth
of ZR-75–30 and BT20 cells was adversely affected by
NSC control thereby precluding meaningful interpretation.
Taken together, these data suggest that BAG-1 may have
a prosurvival role in HER2+ cells and further justifies
investigating the impact of BAG-1 on the sensitivity of
HER2+ cells to trastuzumab and the potential of BAG-1
as a therapeutic target in HER2+ breast cancer.

Effect of BAG-1 overexpression and knockdown
on the growth of HER2+ cells treated with
trastuzumab
To investigate the possibility that targeting BAG-1
protein function in HER2+ cells could influence response
to trastuzumab, BAG-1S, which has previously been
shown to protect MCF7 cells from a variety of stresses
[20], was overexpressed in SKBR3 HER2+ cells as
verified by immunoblot analysis (Figure 3A); an empty

vector was transfected as a control (Figure 3A). HER2
expression levels remained unchanged 96  h posttransfection in control and BAG-1S transfected cells
(Figure 3A). Although treatment with trastuzumab resulted
in 70% reduction in the long-term growth of control cells
(Figure 3A) this was inhibited by overexpression of BAG1S, as reflected by the similar level of growth observed
between untreated and trastuzumab-treated BAG-1S
overexpressing cells (Figure 3A). These data suggest that
BAG-1S overexpression can inhibit the growth-inhibitory
effect of trastuzumab.
We also examined whether response to trastuzumab
could be influenced by BAG-1 protein interactions. To
this end, a BAG domain helix 3 mutant (Q201A/D208A/
Q212A) BAG-1S protein (BAG-1S H3AB), which is
defective in binding HSC70 [34], was overexpressed
in SKBR3 cells as confirmed by immunoblot analysis
(Figure  3A). Studies using a series of BAG-1  deletion
mutants have shown that although helix 3 of the BAG
domain, the region within which the H3AB mutation
occurs, mediates interaction with HSP70 it does not
appear to be important for interaction with RAF-1 [23].
Overexpression of BAG-1S H3AB did not affect HER2
protein expression but resulted in 50% growth reduction
in response to trastuzumab compared to untreated cells
(Figure 3A). These data suggest that growth inhibition by
trastuzumab relies in part on the interaction of BAG-1S
with HSC70 protein chaperones.
We reasoned that a reduction of BAG-1 protein
expression would potentiate the growth-inhibitory effect
of trastuzumab. SKBR3 and BT474 cells, which have
high endogenous BAG-1 expression (Figure  2B) and
whose growth is susceptible to targeting with siBAG-1
(Figure 2C), were selected to address this. Immunoblot
analysis revealed that siBAG-1  resulted in a marked
decrease in BAG-1 expression levels compared to NSC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

but had no effect on HER2 expression (Figure  3B). In
addition, BAG-1 knockdown resulted in ~25% decrease
in the growth of both SKBR3 and BT474 cells relative
to NSC (Figure 3C). When combined with trastuzumab,
siBAG-1 caused a further ~20% reduction in growth in
both cell lines compared to trastuzumab+NSC control
(Figure 3C).
As transient transfections can lead to heterogeneous
and unsustained protein expression, we generated a
SKBR3 Tet-On myc-BAG-1S inducible cell line in order
to further corroborate the protective role of BAG-1 in
response to trastuzumab; a myc tag was chosen in order
to differentiate overexpressed from endogenous BAG-1S.
Two clones were generated which fortuitously exhibited
differential basal (-Doxycycline) levels (Figure  3D)
enabling us to examine the effect of basally overexpressed
BAG-1S on cell growth. Addition of doxycycline resulted
in upregulation of myc-BAG-1S protein expression but
did not affect HER2 protein levels (Figure 3D). Growth
rate correlated with the level of BAG-1S overexpression
in both induced and uninduced conditions. In the absence
of doxycycline, clone 10 grew faster than clone 11
(Figure  3E). Upon induction with doxycycline clone
11 grew faster, relative to its corresponding uninduced
control, versus clone 10 which exhibited higher BAG-1S
basal expression levels (Figure  3D and 3E). Increased
expression of BAG-1S therefore results in significantly
increased SKBR3 growth rate.

Effect of BAG-1 overexpression on the growth of
HER2+ mammary xenografts
To investigate the role of BAG-1 in HER2+
tumorigenesis in the breast, Tet-On myc-BAG-1S
inducible clone 11 or parental SKBR3 cells were
injected into the mammary fat pads of mice that received
18854

Oncotarget

doxycycline-supplemented (induced) or normal water
(uninduced) and were allowed to form tumors over
32 days. Induced Tet-On myc-BAG-1S tumors were 2-fold
larger (mean ± SD: 18.0 ± 6.2 mm3 vs 9.1 ± 3.5 mm3)
(Figure  4A) than uninduced controls. A comparison
between doxycycline-treated Tet-On myc-BAG-1S and
parental SKBR3  tumors, to account for the net effect
of the inducer on the cells, revealed a 5.5-fold increase
in size (mean  ±  SD: 3.3  ±  0.8  mg vs 18  ±  6.2  mg)
(Figure 4A). Haematoxylin and eosin staining revealed
that both induced and uninduced tumors exhibited poorly
differentiated architecture (Figure 4B). Immunoreactivity
of myc-BAG-1S appeared granular, localised to the
cytoplasm, and was overall greater in the induced setting
(Figure  4B). Staining for pancytokeratin, Ki67, and
platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, a marker
indicating mouse vasculature formation within the tumor,
was present at a similar intensity in the area around the
centre of all tumors examined (data not shown). These
data suggest that increased expression of BAG-1S in
HER2+ SKBR3 cells promotes tumor growth in vivo.
We next examined the effect of trastuzumab on
the growth of SKBR3 cells in vitro. When treated with
trastuzumab, growth of doxycycline-induced clones 10
and 11, which overexpress myc-BAG-1S (See Figure 3D),

was greater than that of uninduced controls and correlated
with the level of BAG-1S overexpression, as clone 10
exhibited overall significantly more growth than clone
11 cells (Figure 4C). These data suggest that induction of
BAG-1S overexpression attenuates growth inhibition by
trastuzumab in vitro.

Effect of combining BAG-1-targeting therapies
with trastuzumab on HER2+ cell growth
As BAG-1  knockdown by siRNA enhanced the
growth-inhibitory effect of trastuzumab, we examined
whether using Thio-S (a mixture of compounds) and its
biologically potent constituent Thio-2, which have been
shown to inhibit BAG-1 protein-protein interactions
[27,  29], would have a similar effect. To reduce any
potential non-specific effects of the compounds targeting
BAG-1 and to keep the concentration of compound diluent
(DMSO) in culture to a minimum, we used a 4-fold lower
concentration than previously reported [27, 29] based on
compound titrations we performed. Treatment of SKBR3
or BT474 cells with trastuzumab and Thio-2 combination
resulted in significantly reduced growth compared to
single compound treatments (Figure  5A); the effect
of trastuzumab+Thio-2  was overall more pronounced

compared to trastuzumab+Thio-S. Treatment of SKBR3
or BT474 with a combination of Rituximab (a humanised
anti-CD20 antibody used here as control for antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity) with Thio-2 or Thio-S,
had no additional effect on growth than either of those
BAG-1 inhibitors used in isolation (data not shown).
To examine the enhanced growth inhibition
observed in response to BAG-1 and HER2  targeted
therapies, cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of single compounds or compound
combinations at a constant ratio. Statistical analysis
of the efficacy of compound interactions revealed a
synergistic mode of action for both trastuzumab+Thio-S
and trastuzumab+Thio-2 combinations, in BT474 and
SKBR3 HER2+ but not in MCF7 HER2- cells. In

particular, BT474 were more susceptible than SKBR3 in
response to Thio-2 treatments (Figure 5B). To elucidate
the nature of this synergy at the protein signaling level,
immunoblot analysis was performed to examine the
molecular changes that occur when targeting BAG-1
and HER2 in BT474 cells; compound treatments were
applied for 24 h, similarly to studies by other groups [35].
Treatment with trastuzumab alone resulted in a decrease
in the phosphorylation of HER2, AKTSer473, ERK, p70
S6 kinase (S6K), and ribosomal S6 protein (Figure 5C).
Moreover, phosphorylation of ERK and S6  was
noticeably reduced by Thio-2 treatment alone and no clear
difference with Thio-S alone was observed. Additionally,
phosphorylation of AKTSer473  was slightly reduced by
Thio-2 (Figure 5C). Single treatment with either Thio-2

or Thio-S caused a marked upregulation of AktThr308 and
S6K phosphorylation compared to DMSO control, while
trastuzumab+Thio-2 combination treatment caused a
reduction in the phosphorylation of AKTSer473/Thr308, ERK,
S6K, and S6 compared to trastuzumab+DMSO control
(Figure 5C). In comparison, trastuzumab+Thio-S caused
a smaller reduction in the phosphorylation of AKTThr308,
ERK, and S6 but had no effect on AKTSer473 compared to
trastuzumab+DMSO control. Furthermore, as shown on
the immunoblot in Figure 5C, cell treatment with single
compounds or compound combinations led to a noticeable
increase in the expression levels of p27Kip1, an inhibitor of
G1/S cell cycle transition [36], which was greatest in the
presence of Thio-2.
Analysis of cell cycle using propidium iodide
staining was therefore performed to elucidate the growthinhibitory effect observed in response to combination
treatment targeting BAG-1 and HER2. Results show
that trastuzumab caused G1/S arrest in BT474 cells,
while Thio-2  treatment exhibited greater growth arrest
(Figure  5D). A further increase in G1/S arrest was
observed when trastuzumab and Thio-2  were used in
combination. Thio-S did not induce G1/S arrest on its own
but caused slightly more G1/S arrest when combined with
trastuzumab compared to control (trastuzumab+DMSO)
(Figure  5D). There was no sub-G1 cell fraction, an
indicator of cell death, detected in any of the examined
conditions (data not shown).

S6 protein is an indispensable component of the
40S ribosomal subunit, and is thought to be involved
in regulating translation [37]. Based on the changes we
observed on S6 phosphorylation in response to treatment,
we further investigated the effect of targeting HER2 and/
or BAG-1 on global protein biosynthesis by 35S metabolic
labelling of BT474 cells. Treatment with trastuzumab,
Thio-2, or Thio-S reduced protein synthesis compared to
controls (Figure 5E). When compared to single compound
treatments trastuzumab+Thio-2 combination significantly
attenuated translation, while trastuzumab+Thio-S
treatment had a similar but less pronounced effect
(Figure  5E). Overall, these data show that combining
trastuzumab with the BAG-1 protein-protein interaction
inhibitor Thio-2 synergistically reduces growth of BT474
cells through suppression of ERK and AKT signaling
pathways and leads to a reduction in global protein
synthesis and G1/S arrest (Figure 5F).

Effect of BAG-1 inhibition on trastuzumabresistant cells
We next addressed whether BAG-1  targeting
might be of benefit in cases where acquired resistance
to trastuzumab has developed. To this end, we examined
the effect of targeted BAG-1  therapies on the growth
of trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells characterized by
Nahta et al. [35] in which insulin growth factor receptor 1,

a protein associated with resistance to trastuzumab [38],
interacts with and modulates the activity of HER2. Parental
cells responded to trastuzumab by a ~20% reduction in
growth compared to untreated control (Figure  6A); a
further reduction in growth was observed in response to
trastuzumab+Thio2 and trastuzumab+Thio-S combination
therapies compared to single treatments with trastuzumab,
Thio-2, or Thio-S (Figure 6A). As expected, trastuzumabresistant cells were unresponsive to trastuzumab but
responded significantly more to Thio-2 than parental cells
(Figure 6A); combination treatment (trastuzumab+Thio-2)
did not reinstate sensitivity to trastuzumab.
To corroborate these findings and examine the
role of BAG-1 in the long-term growth potential of
trastuzumab-resistant cells, a siRNA knockdown approach
was used. Following siRNA transfection, viable parental
or trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells were allowed
to grow over 2  weeks. Immunoblot analysis revealed
approximately 70% knockdown in BAG-1 protein levels
(Figure 6B). Quantification of long-term growth showed
that trastuzumab-resistant cells were more susceptible
to treatment with siBAG-1, as indicated by a reduction
in their overall growth, compared to similarly treated
parental cells (Figure 6C). Altogether, our data suggest that
BAG-1 can partially support growth of these trastuzumabresistant cells. Targeting BAG-1 might therefore constitute
a potential therapeutic option for HER2+ breast cancers
refractory to trastuzumab.

by siRNA confirmed that SKBR3 and BT474 HER2+ cell
lines require BAG-1 for optimal growth. Based on this
finding and the fact that induction of BAG-1 expression
leads to the formation of larger xenografts in the mammary
fat pads of mice, we hypothesized that these tumors may
be more resistant to trastuzumab therapy depending on the
level of BAG-1 expression. In support of this, we present
evidence from in vitro culture experiments showing
that induction of BAG-1S expression in two SKBR3
cell clones leads to an increase in their growth rate and
impedes growth inhibition by trastuzumab in a manner
that correlates with the level of BAG-1S overexpression.
Moreover, overexpression of BAG-1S offered protection
in long-term SKBR3 cell cultures after transient exposure
to trastuzumab, suggesting that upregulation of BAG-1
may be a way by which cells could develop resistance to
this drug. This protection is partly due to the interaction
between BAG-1S and HSC70/HSP70 as a BAG domain
helix 3  mutant (BAG-1S H3AB), which is deficient
in chaperone binding, is sensitive to treatment with
trastuzumab. These findings are in agreement with data
published previously by our group showing that BAG-1S
overexpression prevents heat shock-induced long-term
growth inhibition in MCF7 cells through its interaction
with HSC70/HSP70 protein chaperones [20]. Our proofof-principle data show that attenuating endogenous BAG-1
expression by siRNA in HER2+ cells which are partly
dependent on it for growth further increases the growthinhibitory effect of trastuzumab. Our data indicate that
BAG-1 overexpression can support growth of HER2+
breast cancer cells and reduces the growth-inhibitory
effect of trastuzumab both in short and long-term cultures.
In contrast, targeting endogenous BAG-1 function with
siRNA impedes growth of these cells and potentiates the
growth-inhibitory effect of trastuzumab. These results
provide a rationale for assessing BAG-1 as a biomarker of
therapeutic response in clinical studies of breast cancers
treated with trastuzumab.
Based on our current data and previous findings
[20, 27, 29] from our group we hypothesised that using
Thio-S or Thio-2 inhibitors of BAG-1 protein-protein
interactions in combination with trastuzumab, a firstline treatment for HER2+ breast cancer [4], would
further restrict growth of HER2+ breast cancer cells. The
synergistic growth-inhibitory effect observed at the dose
used suggested that the prosurvival function of BAG-1
and HER2  may be exerted on distinct but functionally
convergent signaling pathways. BAG-1 is known to
activate RAF [23] and we have previously reported [29]
that Thio-2 acts at the level of RAF to disrupt BAG-1
protein-protein interactions (Figure 5F). Here, we found
that single Thio-2 treatment markedly inhibited ERK but
had comparatively little effect on AKT activity leading
to attenuation of HER2+ breast cancer cell growth.
Phosphorylation of ERK was slightly reduced with
trastuzumab treatment. Studies have shown that allosteric

DISCUSSION
In this study we show for the first time that
elevated BAG-1 protein expression correlates with
that of HER2, is important for optimal growth of some
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, and impedes
the growth-inhibitory effect of trastuzumab. Moreover,
inducible overexpression of BAG-1S results in the growth
of larger poorly differentiated HER2+ tumor xenografts
in the mammary fat pads of mice, while induction of
BAG-1S expression in in vitro culture attenuates growth
inhibition by trastuzumab. Combination treatment
targeting BAG-1  with small molecule protein-protein
interaction inhibitors and HER2  with trastuzumab
synergistically reduces breast cancer cell growth, which
is accompanied by attenuation of protein synthesis and
induction of G1/S cell cycle arrest through the ERK and
AKT pathways.
Analysis of the METABRIC patient cohort [32]
revealed that BAG-1  mRNA is increased in HER2+/
ER+ as well as HER2+/ER- breast tumors compared to
normal breast epithelium, and in HER2+ cell lines BAG-1
protein expression is elevated. The observed increase in
BAG-1 expression in HER2+ breast cancer cells raised
the possibility that certain HER2+ cells may be dependent
on BAG-1 for growth in response to the HER2-targeted
therapy trastuzumab. Knocking down BAG-1 expression

inhibition of ERK activity exerts a minimal effect on
the proliferation of trastuzumab-sensitive SKBR3 and
BT474 cells [39] and suggest that the growth-inhibitory
effect observed is predominantly driven through the PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway leading to a decrease in S6Ser235/236
phosphorylation and induction of cell cycle arrest. BAG-1
targeting caused compensatory activation of AKT by
phosphorylation at Thr308, which is known to be regulated
by PDK1 [40], and resulted in increased S6K activity,
which is crucial for protein synthesis and cell cycle
progression [41]. As there was little change on AKTSer473
phosphorylation under these conditions, it is less likely
that the observed AKTThr308 phosphorylation was caused
by mTOR, a key activator of AKT [42]. It is conceivable
that this may have been caused by increased activation
of HER2, since combination of BAG-1 inhibitors with
trastuzumab resulted in a reduction of AKTThr308 and
S6KThr389/412 phosphorylation to basal levels. Our data
are consistent with other studies showing that when
used as single agents for cancer therapy, MEK inhibitors
frequently lead to increased AKT phosphorylation by
relieving a negative feedback loop of ERK on HERfamily receptor signaling, which can result in reduced
efficacy [43]. Moreover, trastuzumab caused G1/S cell
cycle arrest that was augmented in the presence of Thio-2
but not Thio-S. This is in line with our previous findings
[29] showing increased potency of Thio-2 over Thio-S at
inhibiting the interactions between BAG-1 with HSC70
and BAG-1 with RAF. This ability of Thio-2 may account
for the increased growth inhibition of HER2+ cells.

Our investigation reveals a protective role for
BAG-1 in HER2+ breast cancer and provides insight
into the mechanism by which increased BAG-1 protein
expression supports cell viability by attenuating the
growth-inhibitory effect of trastuzumab. Combining
BAG-1- and HER2-targeted therapies synergistically
inhibits HER2+ breast cancer cell growth, while
interfering with BAG-1 function targets trastuzumabresistant cells more effectively. The concept of targeting
BAG-1, a protein that supports cancer cell survival
but is also related to improved patient survival, may
on the surface seem paradoxical. Nevertheless, these
observations are not mutually exclusive; since BAG-1
enhances ER transcription and can stimulate ER activity
[14], it would be expected to support growth of breast
cancers that are reliant on BAG-1  related pathways.
This is similar to the ER in ER+ breast cancer where
its expression is associated with good prognosis [44],
whilst the ER remains an excellent target for hormonal
therapy, for example with tamoxifen. A few clinical
implications can be drawn from this study. BAG-1
could be a candidate predictive biomarker by enabling
the definition of breast cancer patient subgroups likely
to display de novo resistance to trastuzumab. Moreover,
our data indicate that disrupting BAG-1 function might
be a useful therapeutic strategy for targeting HER2+
breast cancers in combination with trastuzumab, but also
for those cancers that are refractory to trastuzumab, and
emphasise the need for developing drug-like BAG-1
inhibitors and/or testing the efficacy of existing inhibitors
of BAG-1 mediated pathways.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

were seeded in triplicate in 96  well plates (Corning,
USA) for short-term (4–5  days) cell viability or in
12 well plates for long-term growth assays, as described
by Townsend et al. [20], and treated as described in the
text or figure legends. Uninduced or doxycycline-induced
cells were allowed to grow for a further 24  h prior to
treatment. Following treatment, media were removed and
monolayers fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for
30 min and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 20 min.
Plates were rinsed in a water bath and dried. Growth
was expressed as a measure of the adherent cells by
extracting the associated dye with 10% (v/v) acetic acid
and reading the absorbance at 590 nm with a Varioskan
Flash multimode reader (Thermo Scientific, UK). Longterm growth was measured using ColonyArea ImageJ
(1.48v) plugin [47] and the fraction of growing cells was
expressed as a percent of untreated control as described by
Franken et al. [48].

Cell culture and treatments
All cell lines were purchased from LGC Standards
(UK), while CAL51  were purchased from DSMZ
(Germany); cell lines were grown as recommended by
their suppliers. SKBR3 Tet-On myc-BAG-1S inducible
clones were maintained in DMEM containing 10% (v/v)
tetracycline-free FCS (Biosera, France), 2 mM L-Glutamine,
penicillin (100  units)/streptomycin (100  μg/ml),
and blasticidine/zeocin for selection. Expression of mycBAG-1S was induced by doxycycline (2 µg/ml). MCF10A
cells were cultured as described by Debnath et al. [45].
SKBR3 parental and trastuzumab-resistant (clone 3) cells
were kindly provided by Professor Francisco Esteva (M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center, USA) and cultured as previously
described [35]. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a 10%
CO2 humidified atmosphere. Thioflavin S (Thio-S) practical
grade was from Sigma (UK) and Thio-2 was produced at
the Institute of Pharmacy/Pharmacognosy, University of
Innsbruck as described previously [29]. Trastuzumab was
gifted by the Oncology Pharmacy at Southampton General
Hospital.

Cell lysis and immunoblotting
Cells were lysed on ice for 30  min in RIPA
buffer (CST, UK) containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktails (Sigma, UK). Lysates were clarified
by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 15 min, 4°C), diluted with
Laemmli buffer, and denatured at 95°C for 5 min. SDSPAGE and immunoblotting were performed according to
standard protocols [49]. Most primary antibodies used
were from CST, BAG-1 (3.10 G3E) was from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, and β-actin-HRP was from Sigma (UK).
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Dako
(Denmark). Proteins were detected by SuperSignal West
Pico or Fempto chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo
Scientific, UK) using a BioRad Fluor-S Multiimager with
Quantity One 1-D v4.6.6 image acquisition and analysis
software.

Expression constructs
pcDNA3-BAG-1S wt and H3AB mutant constructs
were generated as described previously by our group
[14,  34]. An inducible Tet-On myc-BAG-1S construct
was generated by touchdown PCR amplification [46] using
primers: 5ʹ- ATTAAGCTTGCCA CCATGGAACAGAA
ACTGATCTCTGAAG AAGACCTGAATCGGAGCCAG
GAGGTGACCC and 5ʹ- CCGCTCGAGCTGCTACACCT
CACTCGG CCAG and subsequent ligation of the resulting
amplicon into a pcDNA4/TO plasmid (T-REx System,
Invitrogen, UK) with HindIII and XhoI flanking sites.

FACS analysis

Cell transfection

For cell cycle analysis, cells were processed as
described before [35]. DNA content was determined by
capturing 20,000 events using a FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson) flow cytometer following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The proportion of cells in different phases of
the cell cycle was analyzed with ModFit LT v4.1.7 and
expressed as a percentage of total cells.

Expression constructs were transfected using Fugene
HD (Promega, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool BAG-1
siRNA or siRNA nonsense control sequences (GE
Healthcare Dharmacon, UK) were transfected by
DharmaFECT 1 reagent according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Cells were seeded for experiments 24 h posttransfection. To generate Tet-On inducible clones,
pcDNA4/TO-myc-BAG-1S:pcDNA6/TR
(T-REx™
System, Life Technologies, UK) vectors were cotransfected into SKBR3 cells and individual clones were
isolated following blasticidine/zeocin selection.

Metabolic labelling
Tran35S-Label (MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France)
was added to the culture medium (0.37 MBq/ml) for
the final 2 h of culture. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer
with protease inhibitors. Lysates were supplemented
with 10 mg/ml L-cysteine and 10 mg/ml L-methionine,
clarified by centrifugation, applied onto Whatmann filter
discs (GE Healthcare, UK), and air dried. Bound proteins
were precipitated by 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid

added to the filter discs before washing in absolute ethanol
and acetone. The filter discs were air-dried, immersed
in OptiScint ‘HiSafe’ scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer,
UK) and radioactivity was measured using a WALLAC
1409  liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, USA).
Control cells were treated with cycloheximide (10 µg/ml).
Counts from cycloheximide-treated samples were

Tumor xenografts and immunohistochemistry

GRANT SUPPORT

NOD.SCID mice (Harlan Laboratories, UK)
were bred and maintained locally under pathogen-free
conditions. Animal experiments were approved by the
local ethical committee and performed under Home
Office license PPL30/2964. Two days before tumor
cell injection, female animals were offered ad libitum
doxycycline-containing (200 μg/ml) water for induction
of myc-BAG-1S expression or plain water as control. For
tumor implantation, SKBR3 Tet-On myc-BAG-1S cells
were mixed 1:1 with BD Matrigel basement membrane
matrix (SLS, UK). Cell suspensions (5 × 106 cells/mouse)
were injected subcutaneously into the mammary fat pad
and allowed to form xenografts over 32  days. Tumors
were measured by callipers, weighed, and cryopreserved
in OCT buffer (CellPath, UK). Haemmatoxylin and eosin
(H & E) staining was performed as previously described
[50] and immunohistochemical detection was performed
using ImmPress HRP polymer detection reagent (Vector
Laboratories, UK) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Sections (5  μm) were mounted and were
imaged using an Olympus digital microscopy/slide
scanning system (Olympus Soft Imaging Systems,
Germany) with a x40 objective with dotSlide v2.2
software. Immunoreactivity was assessed in a blinded
manner by a consultant histopathologist (MAK).
