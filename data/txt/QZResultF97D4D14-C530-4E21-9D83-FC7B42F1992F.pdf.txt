Abstract

Author Manuscript

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a prevalent and devastating disease that claims more lives
than breast, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancers combined. Current research suggests that
standard chemotherapy regimens have been optimized to maximal efficiency. Promising new
treatment strategies involve novel agents targeting molecular aberrations present in subsets of
NSCLC. We evaluated 88 human NSCLC tumors of diverse histology and identified Mer and Axl
as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) overexpressed in 69% and 93%, respectively, of tumors
relative to surrounding normal lung tissue. Mer and Axl were also frequently overexpressed and
activated in NSCLC cell lines. Ligand-dependent Mer or Axl activation stimulated MAPK, AKT,
and FAK signaling pathways indicating roles for these RTKs in multiple oncogenic processes. In
addition, we identified a novel pro-survival pathway—involving AKT, CREB, Bcl-xL, survivin,

and Bcl-2—downstream of Mer, which is differentially modulated by Axl signaling. We
demonstrated that shRNA knockdown of Mer or Axl significantly reduced NSCLC colony
formation and growth of subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Mer or Axl knockdown also
improved in vitro NSCLC sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents by promoting apoptosis. When
comparing the effects of Mer and Axl knockdown, Mer inhibition exhibited more complete
blockade of tumor growth while Axl knockdown more robustly improved chemosensitivity. These
results indicate that Mer and Axl play complementary and overlapping roles in NSCLC and
suggest that treatment strategies targeting both RTKs may be more effective than singly-targeted
agents. Our findings validate Mer and Axl as potential therapeutic targets in NSCLC and provide
justification for development of novel therapeutic compounds that selectively inhibit Mer and/or
Axl.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although prostate and
breast cancer are the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men and women, respectively,
lung cancer kills more people than prostate, breast, colon, and pancreatic cancers
combined 1. The current 5-year survival rate for all stages of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) combined is 17% 2. Significant focus on targeted therapeutics has resulted in
approval of new drugs for lung cancer, including inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). These agents have improved
outcome in approximately 10% and 5% of NSCLC cases, respectively, where EGFR
mutation or ALK rearrangements are present 3, 4. Mutations in KRAS (10–20%), PI3KCA
(3%), BRAF (3%), and ERBB2 (2%) have been found in additional subsets of NSCLC 5–8.
Preclinical target validation studies have demonstrated the utility of inhibiting these mutant
proteins and numerous agents are currently in various phases of clinical development for use
in lung cancer 9–14. The remaining majority of NSCLC diagnoses represent an unmet need
for identification of oncogenic drivers—and novel therapeutic targets—in these molecularly
undefined cases. To address this problem, we have investigated the roles of Mer and Axl
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as novel oncogenic molecules in lung cancer.

Author Manuscript

Mer and Axl are members of the TAM family of RTKs 15. TAM receptors have been
implicated in the development and metastasis of many cancers, including hematologic
malignancies and solid tumors of the brain and breast 16, 17. Previous studies identified Axl
as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC 18, 19, particularly in adenocarcinoma, where Axl
expression correlated with advanced disease stage 20. A proteomic study ranked both Mer
and Axl among the top 20 most phosphorylated RTKs in a subset of NSCLC tumors 21, but
there are no other published reports investigating the role of Mer in NSCLC. This paper
identifies Mer and Axl as frequently overexpressed and activated RTKs in human NSCLC,

and proposes a mechanism by which Mer and/or Axl inhibitors may improve the efficacy of
current NSCLC chemotherapy regimens.

Results
Mer and Axl are frequently overexpressed and activated in NSCLC

Author Manuscript

We evaluated expression of Mer and Axl RTKs in 88 NSCLC patients. Demographic and
histopathologic data are presented in Table 1. Consistent with previous reports, survival was
associated with stage of disease, but not histology 2, 22. Tumor cells exhibited membranous
and cytoplasmic staining for Mer and Axl (Fig. 1A and Supplemental Fig. 1A). Mer
expression was detected (H-Score ≥ 5) in 69% of patients (Table 1) and was generally low
to moderate with a median H-Score of 15 (range: 0–213). However, intermediate (H-Score =
101–300) Mer expression was observed in 5% of patients. Axl expression was detected in
93% of patients and tended to be higher than Mer (median H-Score: 175, range: 0–375) with
intermediate and high (H-Score ≥ 301) expression observed in 66% and 6% of patients,
respectively. Normal lung tissue adjacent to tumors was always negative for Mer and Axl, as
was bronchial epithelium (Fig. 1A and Supplemental Fig. 1A), indicating upregulated
expression of both Mer and Axl specifically in cancer cells. Within the tumor
microenvironment, Mer was strongly expressed in cells exhibiting macrophage morphology,
while Axl expression intensity was variable. Axl, but not Mer, was strongly expressed in
blood vessels (Fig. 1A and Supplemental Fig. 1A and 1B). Mer expression did not correlate
with Axl expression, suggesting that these related RTKs may have different roles in the
pathogenesis of NSCLC. Mer and Axl expression were not associated with overall patient
survival and did not differ significantly by stage or histology (Table 1 and data not shown).

Mer and Axl were also frequently overexpressed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines relative to
normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. In general, Mer and Axl protein
expression patterns (Fig. 1B) were consistent with mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). Mer protein was
overexpressed in 12/13 NSCLC cell lines relative to NHBE cells where Mer was
undetectable. Expression of Mer mRNA was significantly higher in 9/13 NSCLC cell lines
(0.03 – 2.3, P < 0.01) relative to NHBE cells (0.004). Axl protein was overexpressed in 9/13
NSCLC cell lines relative to the low level present in NHBE cells. Axl mRNA levels were
higher in H1299, H157, HCC15, and H2009 cells (0.68–2.35) relative to NHBE cells (0.36).
Significantly lower levels of Axl mRNA were found in the H358 (0.13, P < 0.001) and
H1648 (0.03, P < 0.001) cells relative to NHBE and Axl mRNA was undetectable in
Colo699 cells. Mer and Axl were highly phosphorylated under normal culture conditions in
several NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 1D). Relative Mer phosphorylation (pMer/total Mer) was
highest in Colo699, H1299, and A549 cells, while relative Axl phosphorylation was highest
in H2009, H1299, and A549 cells. These data are consistent with a proteomic study that
identified Axl and Mer as highly phosphorylated in NSCLC tumors and cell lines 21.
Mer and Axl activate multiple oncogenic signaling modules
Activation of Mer and Axl stimulates proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling, including
the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways 15. We utilized a phospho-kinase array to
investigate whether these and/or other oncogenic signaling pathways were activated

downstream of Mer in NSCLC cells. Colo699 cells were used for this experiment because
they express high levels of Mer and do not express Axl (Fig. 1B), thereby eliminating
complications due to Axl activation by the shared ligand Gas6 (Fig. 2A). Nine proteins
(p38α, ERK1/2, GSK3α/β, MEK1/2, MSK1/2, AKT, mTOR, CREB, and FAK) exhibited
increased phosphorylation following Gas6 treatment (Figs. 2B and 2C). We verified our
findings in Colo699 cells as well as three additional NSCLC cell lines (A549, H2009, and
HCC15) by immunoblotting (Fig. 2D). The most robust responses to Gas6 stimulation—
which could be observed in all four cell lines—were phosphorylation of FAK, AKT,
GSK3α/β, and ERK1/2. Gas6-induced CREB phosphorylation was most notable in H2009
cells. An additional protein, ATF1, was identified as Gas6-responsive in H2009 and
Colo699 cells due to cross-reactivity of the anti-phospho-CREB antibody with phosphoATF1. ATF1, a CREB family transcription factor, is activated downstream of MSK1/2 in
response to both growth factors and cellular stress 23. The ten proteins most highly
phosphorylated in response to Gas6 indicate activation of MAPK (MEK1/2, ERK 1/2, p38α,
MSK1/2, CREB, and ATF1), AKT (AKT, GSK3, and mTOR), and FAK signaling modules
downstream of Mer in NSCLC cells (Fig. 2E). Since Axl is expressed and activated by Gas6
in the A549, H2009, and HCC15 cell lines, we cannot rule out contributions of Axl to these
signaling pathways. These data suggest roles for Mer and/or Axl in multiple oncogenic
processes including cell growth, proliferation, survival, and migration.
RNAi depletion of Mer or Axl predisposes NSCLC cells to apoptosis and inhibits prosurvival signaling

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To assess the functional consequences of blocking anti-apoptotic Mer and Axl signaling
pathways, we utilized a short-term YO-PRO-1/PI assay. A549 cells were used for these
studies because they exhibit high relative phosphorylation of both Mer and Axl under
normal culture conditions (Fig. 1D). Constitutive knockdown of Axl (shAxl8, shAxl9) or
Mer (shMer1, shMer4) was achieved in polyclonal A549 populations transduced with two
different target-specific shRNA sequences (Fig. 3A). Clonal isolates were generated from
the shAxl8, shAxl9, and shMer1 populations (shAxl8-G5, shAxl9-D3, and shMer1-G8,
respectively). In general, clonal populations exhibited more robust knockdown of Mer or
Axl than polyclonal populations. Under basal culture conditions, a significant fraction of
shMer1 cells exhibited increased staining with YO-PRO-1 relative to shControl cells,
indicating a higher rate of apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Upon serum starvation, increased YO-PRO-1
staining in shMer1 cells was accompanied by increased PI uptake, indicating an
accumulation of both apoptotic and dead cells. Mer-knockdown A549 cells exhibited higher
rates of basal (37%, P < 0.01) and serum withdrawal-induced (52%, P < 0.01) apoptosis
relative to shControl cells (5% and 20%, respectively) (Fig. 3C). Evaluation of shAxl8 A549
cells revealed a non-significant trend towards more cell death under both basal (14%, P >
0.05) and serum-free (33%, P > 0.05) conditions relative to shControl cells. NSCLC cells
are known to overexpress the pro-survival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL 24, 25, which are
transcriptionally activated by the AKT/CREB signaling pathway 26 identified as
downstream of Mer activation in Figure 2. Activation of these and other pro-survival
signaling proteins was evaluated by western blotting of A549 whole-cell lysates following
serum starvation for two hours to replicate the experimental conditions applied in Figures
3B and 3C. Relative to control A549 cells (wild type and shControl), Mer-knockdown A549

cells (shMer1-G8) exhibited a dramatic reduction in phosphorylation of AKT that correlated
with reduced expression of CREB and Bcl-xL (Figure 3D). In addition, expression of
survivin—an inhibitor of apoptosis recently identified as a poor prognostic factor in
NSCLC 27—was reduced in Mer-knockdown cells. Modulation of this pro-survival
signaling pathway was less robust and restricted to reduced expression of Bcl-xL and
survivin in Axl-knockdown (shAxl8-G5) cells suggesting a possible explanation for the nonsignificant increase in YO-PRO and propidium iodide uptake reported in Figures 3B and 3C.
Unexpectedly, expression of Bcl-2—typically considered a pro-survival factor—was absent
in control A549 cells and upregulated in Mer-knockdown cells. This result suggests either
pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 as previously described 28–31 or compensatory upregulation
of Bcl-2 in response to Bcl-xL inhibition. Taken together, these findings indicate that Mer
provides a survival advantage by stimulating the AKT/CREB/Bcl-xL/survivin signaling
pathway in A549 cells.

Mer or Axl inhibition reduces NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that inhibition of the anti-apoptotic signaling pathways activated
downstream of Mer and Axl would reduce tumorigenic growth. Knockdown of Axl (shAxl8G5) or Mer (shMer1-G8) significantly reduced the average number (16–17, P < 0.05) and
size (344–377 μm, P < 0.001) of A549 colonies relative to shControl cells (32 colonies, 483
μm) (Fig. 4A). With the exception of shAxl8 cells, which produced smaller colonies (426
μm, P < 0.05), the polyclonal Axl- (shAxl8, shAxl9) and Mer-(shMer1, shMer4) knockdown
cells did not exhibit differences in colony-forming capacity relative to the shControl
population (Fig. 4A and data not shown). This effect is likely due to cell-to-cell variation in
Mer and Axl expression levels in the polyclonal populations and more robust knockdown in
the clonal populations. The growth-inhibitory phenotype of Mer and Axl inhibition was
recapitulated by subcutaneous xenograft studies in nude mice (Fig. 4B). Axl knockdown
reduced average tumor size (shAxl8-G5, 155 mm3, P = 0.0565; shAxl9-D3, 159 mm3, P =
0.1135) measured 47 days after injection when compared to shControl tumors (494 mm3).
Mer-knockdown (shMer1-G8) tumors were essentially immeasurable for the entire duration
of the study (27 mm3, P = 0.002 at day 47). These data support our hypothesis that inhibition
of Mer or Axl is an effective anti-tumor strategy in NSCLC.
Mer or Axl knockdown enhances chemosensitivity of A549 cells by promoting apoptosis

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have suggested a role for Axl in mediating resistance to both targeted
therapies 19, 32–34 and cytotoxic agents 35–37. Studies from our laboratory demonstrated that
Mer confers chemoresistance in leukemia and glioblastoma 38, 39. Given our findings that
Mer or Axl inhibition reduces NSCLC tumor growth, at least in part by promoting
apoptosis, we hypothesized that Mer or Axl knockdown would improve the efficacy of
cytotoxic agents by a similar mechanism. To test this hypothesis, control and Mer- or Axlknockdown A549 cells were treated with cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, or etoposide,
and relative cell numbers were determined by MTT assay (Fig. 5A). Mer or Axl knockdown
resulted in 2-to 20-fold reductions in the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of
cisplatin and carboplatin relative to shControl cells (Table 2). In addition, Axl inhibition
significantly improved A549 sensitivity to etoposide and doxorubicin.

The MTT assay measures metabolically active cells, and thus does not distinguish between
the contributions of cell proliferation and cell death. We used the YO-PRO-1/PI assay to
more specifically investigate whether Mer or Axl knockdown increased NSCLC cell death
in response to treatment with cytotoxic agents. Axl-knockdown cells demonstrated a dosedependent increase in apoptosis (39%–59%, P < 0.01) relative to shControl cells (24%–
30%) following treatment with doxorubicin (Fig. 5B). A similar trend was observed when
Axl-knockdown cells were treated with carboplatin. Consistent with the data in Figure 3,
Mer-knockdown cells exhibited higher rates of basal apoptosis (36%, P < 0.05) than
shControl cells (19%). In response to carboplatin, shMer1-G8 cells exhibited significantly
more apoptotic cell death (53%, P < 0.01) than shControl cells (27%–31%). A similar trend
was observed for doxorubicin-treated shMer1-G8 cells. Compared to shControl cells, both
shMer1-G8 and shAxl8-G5 cells exhibited increased PARP cleavage in response to
carboplatin and doxorubicin, confirming apoptotic pathway activation at the biochemical
level (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that Mer and Axl inhibition increases NSCLC sensitivity
to cytotoxic agents by promoting apoptosis and suggest additional mechanisms for Mer and
Axl inhibitors.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

While tyrosine kinase inhibitors selective for mutated enzymes have highlighted the utility
of targeted therapeutics in oncology, mechanisms apart from activating mutations—such as
gene copy number variation, amplification, posttranscriptional regulation by miRNA, and
autocrine or paracrine activation of overexpressed oncogenes—cause an oncogene to
“drive” tumor development. Activating mutations in Mer and Axl have not been described.
Evidence supporting alternative genetic mechanisms of TAM receptor-mediated
oncogenesis is reviewed elsewhere 16. This paper identifies Mer and Axl as RTKs that are
frequently overexpressed in human NSCLC cells lines and tumors relative to surrounding
normal lung tissue. Gas6, a ligand for Mer and Axl, is also frequently expressed by NSCLC
cells and is found in plasma, suggesting that these RTKs are continuously activated in
NSCLC via autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms 40, 41. This is the first report to describe
a role for Mer in NSCLC and extends the findings of previous reports that have indicated a
role for Axl in NSCLC. These results justify further investigation of Mer and Axl inhibitors
as potential therapeutic agents in NSCLC.

Author Manuscript

Mer inhibition was an effective anti-tumor strategy in A549 cells despite relatively low
expression of Mer suggesting that total Mer or Axl levels may not be the optimal means to
identify patients who might benefit from Mer- and/or Axl-targeted agents. A more likely
predictive biomarker might be relative phosphorylation levels of Mer and Axl, which were
high in A549 cells. Although Mer phosphorylation can be difficult to detect and often
requires application of pervanadate to stabilize the signal, we are currently investigating the
utility of various assay platforms—including traditional immunohistochemistry as well as
new ELISA-based methods—to reliably measure Mer phosphorylation in xenograft and
clinical samples. The new ELISA-based technology provides considerably improved
sensitivity relative to traditional western blotting and may permit assessment of Mer
phosphorylation in clinical samples without pervanadate treatment. Alternatively, a specific
tumor gene expression profile might be considered. In addition, Gas6, soluble Axl, and

soluble Mer have been measured in human serum and may have prognostic value in
autoimmune disease and cancer 42–45. Preclinical investigation of translational Mer and Axl
inhibitors is necessary before the predictive value of these and other biomarkers can be
assessed in the clinic.

Author Manuscript

Contrary to our findings, Axl positivity was previously identified as a poor prognostic factor
in lung adenocarcinoma 20. In that report, tumors were defined as Axl-positive if more than
25% of the cells were stained by Axl immunohistochemistry; however, staining intensity
was not evaluated. Our analysis differs in that the H-Score represents the percentage of
positive cells and staining intensity. Both parameters are informative when assessing protein
expression within tumor tissues. In this study, the majority of NSCLC tumors exhibited
overexpression of Mer (69%) and/or Axl (93%) relative to surrounding normal lung tissue
where expression of both receptors was completely absent. Similar patterns were observed
in vitro with overexpression of Mer and Axl protein in 92% and 69%, respectively, of
NSCLC cell lines relative to NHBE cells. Analysis of receptor phosphorylation patterns
revealed that when present, both Mer and Axl tend to be phosphorylated under normal
culture conditions (Axl in 5/5 cell lines and Mer in 6/7 cell lines). This effect could be
related to the presence of Gas6 or another TAM receptor ligand in the serum added to
culture media. Receptor phosphorylation was detected in some cells lines (Mer in Colo699
and Axl in A549, H2009, and HCC15) even after removal of serum from the culture
medium, suggesting that these cells may express Gas6 or another TAM ligand. Future
studies should evaluate the phosphorylation status of Mer and Axl in NSCLC tumor tissues
to investigate whether activation of the two receptors frequently occurs together, and
whether these particular phenotypes have prognostic or predictive value.

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have delineated MAPK/p38/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways
activated downstream of Mer and Axl, and roles for these RTKs in cell survival and
proliferation are well established 15, 38, 39, 46–49. This is the first report to document
activation of these Mer and Axl signaling pathways in lung cancer cells. This is also the first
paper to extend the TAM receptor-activated MAPK pathway to include the downstream
effectors MSK1/2, CREB, and ATF1. A recent study identified a CREB-binding motif in the
Axl promoter region of leukemia cells 50, suggesting that constitutive activation of the
MAPK and/or AKT pathways downstream of Mer and Axl may drive overexpression of
Axl, at least in some cancer cell types. Phosphorylation of GSK3α/β has been previously
described in response to Gas6 but expression of the TAM family receptors was not fully
characterized and thus the upstream receptor involved was not determined 51–53.
Differentiation of signaling pathways downstream of individual TAM receptors is
complicated by the fact that most cell lines express more than one family member. In
addition, antibodies that reliably detect the third family member, Tyro3, were not available
until recently. Although the Mer-positive Colo699 cell line does not express Axl at the
protein or mRNA level, these cells—as well as several other NSCLC cell lines—express
Tyro3 (Supplementary Fig. 3). We used the Mer- and Axl-knockdown A549 cell lines to
explore differences in pro-survival signaling mechanisms downstream of Mer and Axl. Our
results suggest that Mer inhibition induces apoptosis by attenuating pro-survival signaling
mechanisms mediated by AKT, CREB, Bcl-xL, and survivin. Axl inhibition exhibited less

robust modulation of this pathway as demonstrated by reduced Bcl-xL and survivin
expression without inhibition of AKT or CREB. A minimal threshold of Axl expression may
be required for inhibition of this pro-survival pathway as Bcl-xL and survivin expression
was not altered in shControl cells although they exhibited a smaller, but measureable,
reduction in Axl expression relative to Axl-knockdown cells in these experiments.
Expression of Bcl-2 was absent in control and Axl-knockdown A549 cells but upregulated
in Mer-knockdown cells. Although Bcl-2 most commonly exhibits pro-survival function, a
growing body of evidence demonstrates that this protein is also capable of inducing
apoptosis 28, 30, 54, particularly when expressed at high levels or bound to an orphan nuclear
receptor 29, 31. These findings highlight specific differences in pro-survival signaling
mechanisms activated downstream of Mer and Axl in the A549 cell line and may contribute
to the different functional outcomes observed in Mer-knockdown and Axl-knockdown cells.
Development of novel biologic or small molecule inhibitors that selectively inhibit a single
TAM receptor will be useful tools for elucidation of additional signaling pathways that are
unique to individual TAM receptors. The data presented here expand our understanding of
TAM receptor function at the biochemical level and reveal novel pathway interactions that
may be useful as surrogate markers for Mer and Axl inhibition in lung cancer cells.

Axl has been shown to mediate migration and invasion of glioblastoma, lung cancer, and
breast cancer cells 18, 20, 55, 56. The Axl-stimulated signaling pathways that mediate this
phenotype may include upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and transition of solid
tumor cells from an epithelial to mesenchymal morphology 17, 57, 58. Axl/Gas6 signaling via
Rho family GTPases regulates actin dynamics and migration of specialized neurons 47, 59,
but these pathways have not been investigated downstream of Axl in cancer cells. However,
Mer was recently shown to regulate migration of glioblastoma cells via altered FAK and
Rho signaling 60. This novel finding is consistent with previous reports that established roles
for FAK and Rho GTPases in Mer-mediated morphological changes required for phagocytic
engulfment of apoptotic cells 49, 61, 62. Thus, additional studies investigating the role of Mer
in NSCLC migration are warranted.
Our data clearly demonstrate that Mer inhibition has profound functional consequences in
lung cancer cells. Mer-knockdown cells exhibited higher rates of apoptosis, and tumor
growth was significantly reduced in colony formation assays. More impressively, this effect
was recapitulated in mice: growth of xenograft tumors was completely blocked by Mer
knockdown. This study is the first to demonstrate a role for Mer in NSCLC and validate Mer
as a novel therapeutic target in NSCLC.

Author Manuscript

As mentioned above, previous studies identified Axl as a therapeutic target in NSCLC 18–20.
Our results support and expand these findings by demonstrating that Axl knockdown
inhibits NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo, and suggests that Axl inhibition may enhance
the antitumor effects of chemotherapeutic agents by promoting apoptosis. Interestingly, Mer
knockdown was a more effective inhibitor of tumor growth than Axl knockdown, suggesting
that Mer plays a more substantial role than Axl in NSCLC tumor progression. Although Mer
knockdown improved chemosensitivity, this phenotype was limited to the platinum agents
and the IC50 reductions were smaller in magnitude compared to those observed with Axl
knockdown. Upon treatment with cytotoxic agents, Mer-knockdown and Axl-knockdown

cells exhibited similar levels of apoptotic cell death and PARP cleavage suggesting that the
differences in IC50 values observed in the MTT assay may be due to Axl inhibition of
another cellular mechanism such as cell proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that
Mer may play a more prominent role in cell survival and tumor progression while Axl may
be more involved in cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Strategies targeting both Mer
and Axl may therefore work by multiple mechanisms and be most effective.

Author Manuscript

Regardless of whether Mer and Axl play individual or concerted roles in NSCLC, these data
conclusively demonstrate that clinically translatable compounds inhibiting Mer and/or Axl
merit further investigation as potential therapeutics in NSCLC. We are currently
investigating an inhibitory anti-Mer monoclonal antibody and a series of novel Mer- and
Axl-selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mouse models of NSCLC. A
number of other drugs with activity against Mer and/or Axl are in various phases of
development (reviewed in ref. 17).

Materials and Methods
Clinical samples and immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

De-identified clinical specimens of primary tumors were assembled into a tissue microarray
(TMA) by the University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) SPORE in lung cancer tissue
bank core 22. The study protocol was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institution Review
Board. The TMA contains samples from patients diagnosed with NSCLC at the UCCC and
the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution between 1993 and 1999. Only samples from patients
diagnosed at the UCCC were included in this study because clinical follow-up information
was updated in 2008. To assess expression of Mer and Axl proteins in the clinical samples,
we used an enzyme-based staining method whereby binding of horseradish peroxidaseconjugated antibodies is visualized by oxidation of a reporter dye (3, 3′ diaminobenzidene,
DAB). Details are provided in the Supplementary Information.

Author Manuscript

All specimens were scored independently by two board-certified pathologists (D.T.M. and
P.J.). An H-Score was calculated for each specimen by multiplying the percentage of
positive tumor cells (0% to 100%) by the dominant staining intensity (scale 0 to 4). Thus,
the possible range of H-Scores was 0 to 400. When the reliability of a single reader’s scores
was evaluated, the intraclass correlation coefficients 63 for Axl and Mer were moderately
high (0.74 and 0.65, respectively), indicating that the agreement between the two
pathologists was good. The correlation coefficients measuring reliability of using the mean
ratings were relatively high (0.85 for Axl and 0.79 for Mer) indicating excellent agreement
between raters. Based on these two results we used the average scores of the two
pathologists.
Cell culture and reagents
NHBE cells (also known as HBEC-3KT 64) were cultured in bronchial epithelial cell growth
medium (Lonza, CC-3170). The NSCLC cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/
ml). Cell line sources and authentication details are provided in the Supplemental

Information. Recombinant human (rhGas6, 885-GS) and mouse (rmGas6, 986-GS) growth
arrest specific 6 (Gas6) were purchased from R&D Systems and reconstituted in PBS.
Carboplatin (C2538), cisplatin (P4394), and doxorubicin (D1515) were from Sigma.
Etoposide (341205) was obtained from Calbiochem.
Animals and subcutaneous xenograft model

Author Manuscript

All experiments involving mice were approved by the University of Colorado Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Subconfluent cultures of A549 cells were washed with
sterile PBS and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in PBS. Male and female athymic nude mice
(aged 5–9 weeks) received 100 μl of cell suspension via subcutaneous injection in the left or
right flank. Engraftment typically occurred 18–21 days after injection. Beginning on day 19,
tumors were measured twice weekly with calipers and tumor volume (V) was calculated
using the formula V = πa2b/6, where a represents the shortest diameter measured
perpendicular to the longest diameter (b).
Western blotting and phospho-kinase array
Whole-cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10
mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM Na2MoO4)
supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals).
Total protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay and samples
were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
immunoblotting. The protein-kinase array (R&D Systems, ARY003) was performed
according to manufacturer guidelines. All antibodies used for immunoblotting were applied
as recommended by the manufacturer. Vendor catalog numbers are provided in the
Supplementary Information.

Immunoprecipitation and detection of phosphorylated Mer and Axl

Author Manuscript

Phosphorylation of Mer is difficult to measure, possibly due to phosphatases in complex
with Mer that result in extreme lability of Mer phosphorylation. We developed a phosphoMer assay whereby cells are treated with pervanadate (0.12 mM Na3VO4 in 0.002% H2O2)
for 1–2 minutes prior to cell lysis to preserve the phosphorylation status of Mer. Because
pervanadate treatment precludes assessment of downstream signaling events (data not
shown) this procedure was strictly limited to analysis of Mer and Axl phosphorylation. Mer
was immunoprecipitated from pervanadate-treated lysates by incubating with mouse
monoclonal anti-Mer antibody (R&D Systems, MAB8912) followed by incubation with recProtein G-sepharose 4B (Invitrogen, 10–1242) bead slurry. Immune complexes were
collected by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer. Beads were resuspended in
Laemmli buffer (62.5 mM Tri-HCl pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS,
and 0.01% bromophenol blue) and boiled prior to analysis by western blotting. Axl was
immunoprecipitated from the same samples by incubating the supernatant of Mer
immunoprecipitates with goat polyclonal anti-Axl (R&D Systems, AF154) and subsequently
following the same protocol.

Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR

Author Manuscript

Diluted RNA (50 ng/reaction or 5 ng/reaction) was used as a template for real time RT-PCR
in the presence of primer pairs homologous to Mer or Axl and GAPDH, respectively. Primer
and probe sequences and concentrations are provided in the Supplementary Information.
Threshold cycle values (Ct) from at least three independent experiments performed in
triplicate were normalized to the GAPDH internal control using the equation Δ Ct =
Ct Mer or Axl − Ct GAPDH. Standard curves were generated with multiple cell lines, which
demonstrated >99% efficiency of all three primer/probe sets. Thus, a two-fold difference in
RNA concentration per cycle was assumed for calculation of relative expression levels.
Lentiviral transduction and isolation of clonal populations

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Lentiviral vectors (pLKO.1) containing shRNA sequences targeting Mer (shMer1, Oligo ID:
TRCN0000000862 and shMer4, Oligo ID: TRCN0000000865), Axl (shAxl8, Oligo ID:
TRCN0000000574 and shAxl9, Oligo ID: TRCN0000000575), or GFP (RHS4459) were
obtained from Open Biosystems. The GFP vector, which does not express the fluorescent
protein, encodes an shRNA that engages the endogenous RNAi machinery and targets GFP
mRNA; since human cells do not express GFP, this vector serves as a non-silencing control
and is referred to as “shControl” throughout the text. Lentiviral particles were produced
using the 293FT cell line and the third generation packaging system developed by the
laboratory of Dr. Didier Trono. Target cells were incubated in media containing viral
particles and 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Cells were then cultured overnight and incubation with viral media was
repeated the following day to increase transduction efficiency. Cells were cultured overnight
prior to selection in media containing 2 μg/ml puromycin (Clontech). Puromycin resistant
colonies were typically observed 5–9 days after transduction. Polyclonal populations were
maintained in puromycin to prevent loss of knockdown. Stable clonal isolates were obtained
by single-cell flow cytometry sorting and maintained in normal culture media.
Clonogenic colony formation assay
A549 cells were plated in triplicate wells of 6-well dishes at ultra-low density (50 cells/well)
and cultured under normal conditions without perturbation for seven days. Colonies were
washed with PBS and stained with crystal violet (0.5% w/v in 25% methanol). Stained
plates were rinsed in dH2O and allowed to dry at room temperature. Colony diameter and
number was quantified using a GelCount colony counter and software (v1.4, Oxford
Optronix). Only colonies containing > 50 cells were analyzed 65.
YO-PRO-1/propidium iodide assay of apoptosis and cell death

Author Manuscript

Subconfluent cultures of A549 cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells
were lifted with 0.02% EDTA in PBS, combined with culture supernatants, and centrifuged
for 5 minutes at 950g. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 0.2 μM YO-PRO-1
(Invitrogen, Y3603) and 1.5 μM propidium iodide (PI) (Invitrogen, P3566). Uptake of YOPRO-1 and PI was measured using a FC500 flow cytometer and CXP analysis software
(Beckman Coulter). Cells undergoing apoptosis are stained with YO-PRO-1 but are

impermeable to PI. Dead cells and cells in late apoptosis are permeable to both dyes. Viable
cells are not stained by either dye.
Colorimetric assay of relative cell number
A549 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2. Cells were
allowed to adhere overnight before addition of cytotoxic agents or vehicle for an additional
48 hours. MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide, SigmaAldrich) was added and cells were cultured for an additional four hours. Solubilization
solution (2X, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0.01 M HCl) was added and plates were
incubated at 37°C overnight. Optical density was determined at 562 nm with a reference
wavelength of 650 nm. Relative cell numbers were calculated by subtraction of background
absorbance and normalization to untreated controls.

Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

All data are representative of three independent experiments unless otherwise noted.
Statistical analyses of immunohistochemistry data were performed by the University of
Colorado Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core using SAS/BASE and SAS/STAT software,
Version 9.2 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute Inc.). Descriptive statistics were
calculated. Continuous variables were categorized: age at diagnosis was dichotomized at its
median 62-years; Mer H-Score and Axl H-Score were categorized according to
convention 22. For clinical characteristics (age at diagnosis, histology, and sex), statistical
significance between different levels of each characteristic was assessed by log-rank test. On
stage, categorical Axl H-Score, and categorical Mer H-Score, statistical significance
between different levels of each factor was assessed by log-rank test for trend as these
variables are considered ordinal. Statistical analyses of all other data were performed using
Prism 5 (Version 5.04, GraphPad Software, Inc.).

cancer tumors and cell lines

(A) Immunohistochemical staining of Mer and Axl in sections of normal human lung and
squamous cell carcinoma of human lung. Micrographs shown represent the range of staining
observed in tumor cells (T). Adjacent normal tissue (N) was always negative for Mer and
Axl as was bronchial epithelium (BE). Macrophages (M, arrows) were strongly positive for
Mer and blood vessels (V) were strongly positive for Axl. The scale bar in the upper right
panel is applicable to all micrographs and represents 100 μm. (B) Whole-cell lysates of the
indicated cell lines were subjected to western blot (WB) analysis using the indicated
antibodies. Two exposures (exp) are shown for Mer and Axl. In 13/13 NSCLC lines tested,
Mer and/or Axl are overexpressed relative to levels found in normal human bronchial
epithelial (NHBE) cells. Variation in the molecular weight of each receptor is likely due to
cell line-specific patterns of glycosylation as the extracellular domains of Axl and Mer
contain 6 and 13 glycosylation sites, respectively. Tubulin was used as a loading control.
Numbers on the left indicate the location of molecular weight (kDa) markers. Blots
representative of at least three independent experiments are shown. (C) Real-time RT-PCR

shown in panel B. Two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-tests were used to compare the
mean ΔCt values derived from at least three independent measurements. The mean + SD of
antilogged ΔCt values (2−Δ Ct) are shown. The asterisks indicate significant differences
versus NHBE (*** P < 0.001, ** P < 0.01, * P < 0.05). (D) Mer and Axl were
immunoprecipitated from whole-cell lysates of steady-state cultures of a subset of the
NSCLC cell lines shown in A and B. Phosphorylated and total levels of Mer and Axl
proteins were assessed by western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Mer (pMer, Y749/Y753/
Y754, PhosphoSolutions) and anti-Mer antibodies or anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr, Millipore,
05–1050) and anti-Axl antibodies, respectively. Blots representative of at least three
independent experiments are shown.

pathways in NSCLC cells

Subconfluent cultures of A549, H2009, HCC15, and Colo699 NSCLC cells were incubated
in serum-free medium for two hours followed by ten minute stimulation with (+) or without
(−)200 nM rGas6 (human or mouse). (A) Mer and Axl immunoprecipitates were analyzed
by western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Mer (pMer) and anti-Mer antibodies or antiphosphotyrosine (pTyr) and anti-Axl antibodies, respectively. Due to variation in expression
levels among the cell lines, longer exposure times are shown for pMer in A549 cells and for
pTyr in HCC15 and Colo699 cells and shorter exposures are shown for both pMer and total
Mer in Colo699 cells. Blots representative of at least three independent experiments are
shown. (B) Diluted Colo699 lysates were incubated with human phospho-kinase array
(R&D Systems, ARY003) membranes and bound phospho-proteins were detected according
to kit instructions. Each membrane contains kinase specific (e.g., 1–9) and positive control

on the array is available on the R&D Systems website (http://www.rndsystems.com/pdf/

pixel density of each positive control to 100. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of duplicate
spots from a single experiment. Quantification of the protein spots that did not exhibit Gas6responsive phosphorylation is provided in Supplemental Figure 2. (D) Protein expression
was assessed by western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates using the indicated antibodies.
Numbers on the right indicate the location of molecular weight markers. Tubulin was used
as a loading control. Due to variation in expression levels among the cell lines, a shorter
exposure is shown for Mer in Colo699 cells and longer exposures are shown for pFKA
(HCC15 and Colo699 cells) and pAkt (H2009 and HCC15 cells). Blots representative of at
least three independent experiments are shown. (E) Flow chart of signaling modules

(A) Whole-cell lysates of the indicated A549 cell lines were subjected to western blot
analysis using anti-Mer and anti-Axl antibodies. Tubulin was used as a loading control.
Blots representative of at least three independent experiments are shown. (B) Representative
scatter plots of Mer-knockdown (shMer1) and shControl A549 cells incubated in the
presence (Untreated) or absence (Starved) of 10% fetal bovine serum for 1–5 hours.
Apoptotic and dead cells were identified by flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with
YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide. The percentages of apoptotic (bottom right) and dead
cells (top) are shown. (C) Cumulative data demonstrate a significant accumulation of
apoptotic and dead cells when Mer expression is reduced (** P < 0.01 vs shControl, 2-way
repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posttests, n = 12). Mean values and
standard errors are shown. (D) Wild type, shControl, shMer1-G8, and shAxl8-G5 A549 cells
were cultured in serum-free medium for two hours to mimic the experimental conditions in
panels B and C. Whole-cell lysates were subjected to western blotting with antibodies
against the indicated proteins. Tubulin was used as a loading control. Blots representative of

(A) Clonogenic colony formation assays. Wild type, shControl, and Axl- (shAxl8, shAxl8G5) or Mer- (shMer1, shMer1-G8) knockdown A549 cells were plated at ultra-low density
and cultured for 7 days. Colony number and diameter were determined. Each bar represents
the mean + SEM derived from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Oneway analysis of variance was used to compare shControl cells to all other A549 cells lines.
shControl cells produced smaller colonies than wild type cells, although no difference in
colony number was observed between wild type and shControl cells. * P < 0.05, *** P <
