ABSTRACT
Interpretation of complex cancer genome data, generated by tumor target
profiling platforms, is key for the success of personalized cancer therapy. How to draw
therapeutic conclusions from tumor profiling results is not standardized and may vary
among commercial and academically-affiliated recommendation tools. We performed
targeted sequencing of 315 genes from 75 metastatic breast cancer biopsies using
the FoundationOne assay. Results were run through 4 different web tools including
the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGidb), My Cancer Genome (MCG), Personalized
Cancer Therapy (PCT), and cBioPortal, for drug and clinical trial recommendations.
These recommendations were compared amongst each other and to those provided by
FoundationOne. The identification of a gene as targetable varied across the different
recommendation sources. Only 33% of cases had 4 or more sources recommend
the same drug for at least one of the usually several altered genes found in tumor
biopsies. These results indicate further development and standardization of broadly
applicable software tools that assist in our therapeutic interpretation of genomic data
is needed. Existing algorithms for data acquisition, integration and interpretation will
likely need to incorporate artificial intelligence tools to improve both content and
real-time status.

INTRODUCTION

Therapeutic interpretation of genomic data from
tumor biopsies is challenging at multiple levels. It has been
suggested that molecular alterations in a single biopsy may
not be representative of the entire tumor [7]. However, it
is also clear that the majority of molecular abnormalities
are shared across different regions of a cancer and even
between metastatic sites, therefore the importance of
private mutations is still debated. Most commercial,
and many academic laboratories, perform tumor-only
sequencing and it is increasingly recognized that several
of the variants (up to 15–20%) that are assumed to be
somatic mutations may in fact be germline alterations. To
what extent germline variants represent actionable targets
is unknown [8]. Furthermore, there is no perfect method
to predict the impact of a nucleic acid variant on protein
function. Many computational algorithms exist that

Molecular target profiling of cancer is readily available
in the clinic through commercial diagnostic companies and
CLIA-accredited academic laboratories. Many of the assays
rely on next generation sequencing methods, sometimes also
including other techniques, to detect DNA sequence changes
or other molecular abnormalities in tumor specimens. It is
expected that the results will assist in selecting a therapy that
is tailored to the specific molecular abnormalities of a given
cancer [1]. Guidelines exist for the analytical validation of
next generation sequencing and omics-based assays [2, 3]
and the technical reliability of several clinically available
assays have been published [4–6]. The clinical interpretation
of the results, however, is less clear.

predict functional impact for a variant (SIFT, PolyPhen,
Mutation Assessor, etc) but the true accuracy of these
predictions is uncertain and they often yield conflicting
results for the same variant [9]. Laboratory validation of
biological impact is only available for very few mutations
and variants. Finally, linking molecular abnormalities to
potential therapeutic agents is also challenging and often
inconsistent [10].
Putting mutations into a therapeutic context requires
a broad range of expertise and a substantial amount of time
on literature and database searches. Short of the handful
of clinically validated targets (e.g. EGFR, c-KIT, HER- 2,
AKT, ROS1, BRAF, BCR-ABL, PML-RARα) that
represent only a very small subset of mutated genes, there
is no universal agreement, or algorithm, for determining
what mutations in what genes are clinically actionable
and what treatment to recommend. Many academic
institutions have started molecular tumor boards which
include clinical disease experts, molecular pathologists,
bioinformaticians, laboratory scientists and phase I clinical
trialists to assist in the clinical interpretation of complex
genomic data [11, 12]. Several academic institutions
and scientific organizations have developed free online
tools to assist this process. The Drug-Gene Interaction
Database [13], My Cancer Genome [14], Personalized
Cancer Therapy [15] and cBioPortal [16–18] represent
the most readily available public resources to match genes
and particular mutations to therapies that might target
these. Each of these tools employs a distinct strategy
that includes various combinations of automatic search
algorithms and manual curation to synthesize information
from databases and from the published literature.
The purpose of this study was to examine to what
extent the different web tools identify similar therapeutic
options for a given set of gene level anomalies observed
in a cancer biopsy and if these options are concordant
with those suggested by the diagnostic laboratory that has
performed the molecular profiling.

were temsirolimus for alterations in 15 genes (PIK3CA,
PIK3R1, PTEN, STK11, AKT-1, -2, -3, TSC2, KIT,
PDGFRB, KRAS, VHL, RPTOR, NF1, BRAF) followed
by everolimus for 14 genes (same as temsirolimus except
BRAF) and regorafenib for 10 genes (FGFR -1, -2, FLT -2,
- 4, KDR, KIT, KRAS, PDGFRβ, VHL, BRAF) (Table 3).
However, for a given mutated gene, a drug
recommendation by one source did not imply identical
recommendation from another source. Only for 2 genes
(KIT, FLT3) did all 5 sources recommended the same
drug. Three other genes (BRAF, FGFR1, FGFR2,)
had drug recommendation from all 5 sources, but the
recommendations were partially discordant (Figure 1 and
Table 2). There were 7 genes (PDGFRB, BRAF, EGFR,
ERBB2, FGFR1, SRC & FGFR2) with the same drug
recommendation from 4 sources and 11 genes with drug
recommendations from 3 sources; among these 10 had
at least one drug recommended by all 3 sources. There
were 12 genes for which only 2 web sites made drug
recommendations, but 11 of these genes had the same drug
recommended by both. These results indicate only partial
overlap in identifying similar treatment options based on
the same mutation data among different web-based tools
and FoundationOne.
The median numbers of drugs for a targetable gene
identified by the different tools was 2 for Foundation
One (range 1–11), 3 for DGIdb (range: 1–24), 5 for
PCT (range: 1–10), 2 for MCG (range 1–7) and 2 for
cBioPortal (range: 1–20). Clinical trial recommendations
were reported for 56 of the 103 genes by FoundationOne.
Only 7 of these genes (AKT1, BRAF, FGFR1, FGFR2,
KIT, PIK3CA & PTEN) had at least one clinical trial that
was recommended by both the FoundationOne report and
another source (Figure 2). The median number of clinical
trials recommended by FoundationOne (for 56 genes),
MCG (for 5 genes) and PCT (for 9 genes) was 2, 51 and
9 respectively.
For individual cases, the drug or clinical trial
recommendations ranged from high degree of overlap
to no overlap across the 5 tools. Figure 3 illustrates
recommendations at the cohort level, case level and gene
level for a single case. This cancer had 10 mutated genes with
multiple drug recommendations that illustrate the various
degrees of overlap in treatment options. For example, KIT
had identical recommendations by all 5 tools, KRAS, TOP1
and JAK2 had 3 tools reporting the same drug as an option,
while GNAS and TP53 each had drug recommendations
by FoundationOne only. Alterations in AURKA, BRCA2,
SMAD4 & ZNF217 had no drug recommendations.
Overall, 3 cases had at least 1 gene with an identical drug
recommendation from all 5 sources, 22 cases with an
overlapping recommendation from 4 sources, 32 cases from
3 sources, 12 cases from 2 sources and 6 with no overlapping
recommendations at all. Additionally, 21 cases had at least
1 overlapping clinical trial recommendation from 3 sources,
33 cases had 2 sources and 21 cases had at least 1 gene

RESULTS
One hundred and three genes had predicted
deleterious nucleic acid variants or copy number changes
in at least one of the biopsy specimens determined by a
commercial diagnostic laboratory; we refer to these as
“mutated genes”. The median number of mutated genes
per specimen was 5 (range 2 to 18). The most commonly
affected gene was TP53, 37 of 75 (49%) specimens had
alterations, followed by the PIK3CA (40%). Table 1 lists
each of the affected genes and their frequencies. Forty
three genes (42%) had at least one FDA-approved drug
recommendation by at least one tool (Table 3). The website
that identified the most drugs was DGIdb (for 36 genes)
followed by the FoundationOne report (for 31 genes),
cBioPortal (for 25 genes), MCG (10 genes) and PCT
(for 9 genes). The most commonly recommended drugs

DISCUSSION

with a clinical trial recommendation from FoundationOne,
but no recommendations from any of the other sources. In
summary, 33% of the metastatic breast cancer cases had a
drug recommendation for at least 1 of its mutated genes that
was agreed upon by 4 or more of the sources and 72% had
a clinical trial recommendation agreed upon by 2 or more
of the sources.

The purpose of this study was to examine to what
extent different web tools and a widely used commercial
service identify similar therapeutic options for a
given set of genomic anomalies in a cancer. Our data
represents the typical clinical scenario of tumor only

research biopsies obtained mostly from a metastatic
site in heavily pretreated patients. Target profiling was
performed by FoundationOne assay. We observed only
partial overlap in finding similar treatment options based
on the same mutation data among 5 recommendation
sources designed to enable personalized medicine. Only
33% of cases had a drug recommendation agreed upon
by 4 or more sources for at least 1 mutated gene. The
different tools identified different number of genes as
targetable with off-label use of FDA-approved drugs.
Using the same input data from the FoundationOne
reports, DGIdb identified 36 genes, FoundationOne
identified 31 genes, cBioPortal 25 genes, MCG 10 genes
and PCT 9 genes as potentially targetable. Furthermore,
clinical trial recommendations were provided by
only half of the web tools (MCG & PCT) and were
less frequently provided for both web tools combined
(14 genes) than FoundationOne alone (56 genes). While
we recognize that identical treatment recommendations
for a given molecular abnormality from multiple sources
does not imply clinical validity or increase the likelihood
that the suggested treatment would work, our findings
highlight the challenges in interpreting clinical tumor
profiling results.

Different therapeutic conclusions can be drawn
from the same data depending on what analytic tool is
used. This is primarily due to the different rules used
by different tools to define what constitutes a druggable
gene. Concordance was greater when there was high
level of evidence from clinical trials that a given drug
directly targets a particular molecular abnormality
(e.g. Kit, BRAF, ERBB2). However, for the majority
of mutations and affected genes no such drug exists. In
these instances, potential drug efficacy is inferred from
biological principles or from off-target effects of kinase
inhibitors. Different websites apply different rules to
such circumstantial evidence that largely explains the
substantial discordance. For example, the most frequently,
but not the most concordantly recommended drug,
was the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus for alterations in
PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, STK11, AKT-1, -2-, 3, TSC2,
KIT, PDGFRB, KRAS, VHL, RPTOR, NF1 and BRAF
based on biological pathway-level association. The effect
of temsirolimus on these targets is hypothetical since no
mutations in any of these genes have been directly linked
to temsirolimus sensitivity in patients, therefore discordant

example is FGFR4 amplification. One source identified

ponatinib, and two other tools identified palifermin (but
not ponatinib) as potential options, among other drugs.
Neither of these drugs represents a valid option. Ponatinib
is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that primarily targets BCRABL but also inhibits the FGFR receptor family; however,
it has been withdrawn from the market due to serious
toxicity concerns in 2013 [19]. Palifermin is a truncated
recombinant keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), which
mimics the actions of endogenous KGF by binding
to and activating the fibroblast growth factor receptor
2b (FGFR2b) [20]. There is no plausible biological
hypothesis, or preclinical, data suggesting that palifermin
would work as an anticancer drug for FGFR4-amplified
cancers.
Since drug approval status and clinical trial options
evolve rapidly as does our understanding of molecular
pathways and drug targets, expert curation is currently still
critical for the accuracy of the data. Unfortunately, human
review of data elements is low throughput, time consuming
and may also be of variable quality. The annotation
databases also often lack information on the effect of
gene level alterations (e.g. loss-of-function mutation
vs amplification or gain-of-function mutations) on the
biological pathway activity that is involved. A further

difficulty arises from the presence of multiple mutations
in different genes in the same cancer which may result in
multiple different drug recommendations (Figure 3). This
is consistent with the notion that ultimately combinations
of targeted drugs will be required for successful therapy
[21]. However, most of the drug combinations that would
match the molecular abnormalities in a particular cancer
have never been tested formally for safety in a Phase I
trial.
In summary, we examined 4 different websites
and a commercial service that were designed to link
mutated genes to potential therapeutic options and found
only partial overlap in the treatment options that were
identified for the same genomic abnormalities. The
highly curated sites contain more accurate information
but only cover a very small number of genes, while the
sites that are more broadly applicable are also more
error prone and can include outdated information or
link mutations to drugs that are not supported by strong
evidence. Further improvements in search algorithms,
data integration from multiple sources, and rapid and
real-time interpretation of the peer-reviewed literature
combined with artificial intelligence tools will be
required for the development of broadly applicable

menu and clinical trial options are listed through the
clinicaltrials.gov website using the NCT identifier number
and study title. Specific drug recommendations are also
provided since 2015. The Personalized Cancer Therapy
(PCT) website is affiliated with MD Anderson Cancer
Center (https://pct.mdanderson.org/). It includes detailed
biological information in various disease contexts on
20 genes that can be selected from a dropdown menu. It
relies both on manual curation and automatic database
mining [15]. The intended audience is both patients and
clinical researchers. Only clinically accessible drugs
(approved or in active clinical trials) are listed and links

gov website. The cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.
org/public-portal/) is affiliated with Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center and provides access to a variety
of information on 17,584 tumor samples from 69 cancer
studies [16–18]. It integrates data from a large number of
diverse sources and is intended audience are researchers.
For a query, cancer data type and assay platform must
be selected and a gene symbol entered. The output is
presented as interactive molecular and epidemiologic data
drawn from the selected database and data platform and
can be accessed through various tabs which lead to tables
and graphical results. Drugs that interact with the selected
gene (either in preclinical or clinical experiments) can be
found under the “network” tab and are embedded in an
interactive gene network diagram; drug information can
be filtered by FDA approval status. There is no listing of
clinical trials. For this study, a gene was queried selecting
the Breast cancer - TCGA (provisional) database and
mutation and copy number level alterations, and potential
drugs were identified through the network function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and molecular data
Molecular target profiling was performed in
the context of a clinical study (clinicaltrial.gov:
NCT01855503) to identify potentially actionable
molecular abnormalities in prospectively collected
metastatic tumor biopsy specimens of breast cancer
(n = 33 liver, n = 13 lymph node, n = 5 breast, n = 5 skin,
n = 5 soft tissue, n = 3 lung, n = 3 ovary, n = 8 other). The
study was approved by the Human Research Committee of
the Yale Cancer Center. Seventy-five patients were accrued
between June 2013 and June 2015. Target profiling was
performed using the FoundationOneTM (Foundation
Medicine Inc. Cambridge, MA) targeted sequencing assay
that interrogates the coding sequence of 315 cancer-related
genes and select introns from 28 genes often rearranged
in solid tumors [1, 4]. The assay report includes only
molecular abnormalities that are deemed potentially
actionable using a proprietary method and lists the drugs
and clinical trials that represent therapeutic options
(Supplementary Table S1 lists the specific abnormalities
for each cases and the location of the biopsy).

Web tools
We ran the results from each case through 4 different
websites that were designed to link mutated genes to
potential therapeutic options. Table 3 presents an overview
of the websites. The Drug-Gene Interaction Database
(DGIdb) is affiliated with Washington University
School of Medicine (http://dgidb.genome.wustl.edu) and
integrates data from 13 primary sources to provide over
14,144 drug-gene interactions involving 2,611 genes
and 6,307 drugs [13]. It’s intended for researchers and
has a specific disclaimer that the information is not to
be used for medical advice. The input information is any
gene symbol and the output is a list of generic, brand or
developmental code names of drugs that are unfiltered for
duplicates. The result also includes the predicted effect
of the chemical entity on gene function (i.e. activator
or inhibitor) and the name of the source database.
This website does not identify clinical trials options.
The My Cancer Genome (MCG) website is affiliated
with Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (http://www.
mycancergenome.org/) and provides extensive background
information and potential clinical trial options for specific
mutations in 55 genes in 21 different cancer types [14].
It is based on manual curation by physician-scientists
and is intended to provide clinically relevant information
for patients, and clinical researchers. During the query,
the cancer type and gene is selected from a dropdown
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Data collection and analysis plan
Treatment options were retrieved from all 4 web
sites for all cases by entering every altered gene that was
detected in a given cancer and reported by Foundation
One. Abnormalities were collapsed at gene level because
none of the sites were designed to interpret specific
variants (with a few exception of canonical oncogenic
mutations). Results were categorized as either FDA
approved drugs (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/
cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm) or clinical trial options defined
by the National Clinical Trial (NCT) identifier. We use
the term FDA-approved drug to indicate commercial
availability under some cancer indication; we do not imply
that a given drug is approved for breast cancer. We did
not consider drugs or molecules that are not commercially
available. Duplicate entries and drug name aliases were
removed to create a single entry for each drug or trial.
We assigned drug targets to “primary” or “secondary”
categories whether the target represented the presumed
main mechanism of action of a drug or an ancillary effect.
The biopsies were collected over a 24 months period and
