T Cells by Low-Dose Cyclophosphamide Is Explained
by Reduced Intracellular ATP Levels

Abstract
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells have been shown to play important roles in mediating cancer
development. Although cyclophosphamide (CY) has shown promise as a drug to selectively target Treg cells
with low-dose in vivo, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this report, we provide evidence that ATP, the energy molecule and signal element, accounts for the selective depletion of Treg cells by
low-dose CY. Relative to conventional T cells or other cell types, ATP levels were much lower in Treg cells. This
was due to Treg cells that downregulate one microRNA, miR-142-3p, and upregulate ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase CD39. The transfection of miR-142-3p or the blockade of CD39 could increase intracellular ATP levels of Treg cells, consequently decreasing the sensitivity of Treg cells to low-dose CY. On the
other hand, the transfection of miR-142-3p inhibitor or the addition of soluble CD39 to the cultured CD4+CD25−
T cells resulted in the decrease of intracellular ATP levels and increase of sensitivity of conventional T cells to
low-dose CY. Furthermore, we found that the low levels of ATP attenuated the synthesis of glutathione, leading
to the decrease of CY detoxification, thus increasing the sensitivity of Treg cells to low-dose CY. Therefore, we
here identify a molecular pathway through which low-dose CY selectively ablates Treg cells. Our findings also
imply that low levels of ATP are probably related to Treg cell function. Cancer Res; 70(12); 4850–8. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are of paramount importance to the maintenance of peripheral selftolerance and avoidance of autoimmunity (1, 2). However,
under pathologic conditions, cancers can use Treg cells
for immune evasion. The number of functional Treg cells
is elevated in cancer patients, leading to the observed immunosuppression (3–7). Therefore, to potentiate elimination
of tumors by the immune systems, targeting Treg cells may
be beneficial. Cyclophosphamide (CY) has recently shown
promise as a drug to target Treg cells (8–10).
CY, an alkylating agent, is widely used in the treatment of
malignancies as well as autoimmune disorders (11). However, in low doses, CY has been reported to reduce suppres-

sor function of uncharacterized T cells (12, 13). It is now
clear that low-dose CY can selectively ablate CD4+CD25+
Treg cells, leading to the enhancement of immune responses
(14, 15). Based on this principle, low-dose CY has been successfully tested in the treatment of various types of tumor
(16–18). Moreover, our observations indicated that low-dose
CY can effectively prevent the recurrence of condylomata
acuminata caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) by selectively depleting Treg cells.4 These findings together indicate
that low-dose CY might be an ideal agent to target Treg cells
clinically. However, the molecular mechanism by which lowdose CY selectively targets Treg cells is unclear.
CY is a prodrug subject to a series of biological activation
steps necessary for its cytotoxic effect (19). These include the
following: (a) catalysis of CY to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide
by hepatic cytochrome P450 isozymes; (b) interconversion of
4-hydroxycyclophosphamide with its tautomer, aldophosphamide; (c) diffusion of aldophosphamide out of hepatic cells
into the circulation, and subsequent uptake by other cells;
and (d) spontaneous degradation of aldophosphamide to
phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. On the other hand,
multiple detoxification routes may be used by cells, including
oxidation of aldophosphamide to the inactive carboxyphosphamide by aldehyde dehydrogenases (20). In addition, glutathione, the most abundant intracellular nonprotein thiol,
also serves to detoxify CY. Both CY itself, phosphoramide

mustard, and other metabolites can be detoxified by conjugation with glutathione (20, 21).
Glutathione is synthesized from glutamate, cysteine, and
glycine by two successive reactions with glutamate cysteine
ligase and glutathione synthetase, respectively (22). Notably,
these two enzymatic reactions are dependent on ATP. Coincidently, ATP levels in Tregs have been shown to be regulated by the low expression of miR-142-3p, resulting in a
high level of adenylyl cyclase 9 (23). The latter converts intracellular ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). In line with this,
Bopp and colleagues (24) showed that naturally occurring
Treg cells harbor high levels of cAMP for their suppressive
function. In addition, CD39 and CD73 expressed on Treg
cells catalyze extracellular ATP to adenosine (25–27), further
implying a possible link between altered ATP and Treg cells.
We hypothesize that Treg cells express low concentrations
of ATP, leading to the decrease of cytosolic glutathione and
the increase of sensitivity to low-dose CY.

Materials and Methods
Donor samples
Peripheral blood samples were taken from healthy volunteers and were approved by the Ethical Committee of the
Medical Faculty of Tongji Medical College. Informed consent
was obtained from all subjects.
Cell sorting
The splenocytes from naive BALB/c mice were labeled
with FITC-conjugated CD3, phycoerythrin-conjugated
CD4, and allophycocyanin-conjugated CD25 antibodies
(eBioscience). The CD3+CD4+CD25− and CD3+CD4+CD25+
cells were sorted according to our previous report (23).
In addition, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-human CD3,
phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD4, phycoerythrinCy5–conjugated anti-human CD127, and allophycocyaninconjugated anti-human CD25 antibodies (eBioscience). The
CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127− Treg cells and CD3+CD4+CD25−CD127+
conventional T cells were sorted.
The sorted Treg cells used for the experiments were >95%
in purity by flow cytometric analysis of intracellular Foxp3
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Intracellular ATP detection
The isolated Treg cells or conventional T cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/mL interleukin 2 (IL-2) for
12 hours. Cells (2 × 104) were used to measure the concentration of intracellular ATP with the ATP Bioluminescent
Somatic Cell Assay kit (Sigma) according the manufacturer's
instruction. The result was expressed by mole per cell.
Treg cell induction in vitro
Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) was used to induce
the conversion of murine CD4+CD25− T cells into Treg cells
according to the previous report (28). Briefly, CD4+CD25−
T cells were stimulated with 0.5 μg/mL anti-CD3 in the
presence of irradiated T cell–depleted splenocytes as

www.aacrjournals.org

allophycocyanins, 1 ng/mL recombinant murine IL-2, and
5 ng/mL recombinant murine TGF-β1 (PeproTech) for
7 days of culture.
For human Treg induction, purified CD4+CD25−CD45RA+
T cells were activated with 5 μg/mL plate-bound anti-CD3,
1 μg/mL soluble anti-CD28, and 1 ng/mL IL-2 (PeproTech)
in the presence of 10 nmol/L all-trans retinoic acid ATRA
(Sigma) and 5 ng/mL recombinant human TGF-β (PeproTech) for 7 days of culture as previously described (29). ATRA
was first dissolved in DMSO at 10 mmol/L and further diluted in complete medium.
In both cases, after 7 days of culture, CD4+CD25+ cells were
sorted for another 12-hour culture in the presence of 1 ng/mL
of IL-2 for ATP detection.
Northern blot for microRNA
Total RNA was extracted from cells with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen). RNA (30 μg) was separated on a 15% denaturing
polyacrylamide gel. The RNA was then transferred to Genescreen Plus membranes (Perkin-Elmer). Biotin-labeled oligo
nucleotide complementary to the mature miR-142-3p was
synthesized by Signosis, Inc. The membranes were incubated
with labeled probe. Prehybridization and hybridization were
carried out using hybridization buffer. The most stringent
wash was carried out in 2× SSC and 1% SDS at 37°C.
Transfection assay
Stability-enhanced miR-142-3p (Dharmacon), miR-142-3p
inhibitor (Ambion), and the corresponding control oligonucleotides were purchased: miR-142-3p and its inhibitor.
The transfection assay was performed according to our previous report (23).
Detection of cell viability
The HepG2 cell line was treated with different concentrations of CY (0, 0.2, 2, 10, and 100 μg/mL) for 6 hours. Then,
the supernatants were used to culture Treg cells and conventional T cells for 24 hours. The apoptotic cells were analyzed
with FITC-conjugated Annexin V (BD Biosciences) by flow
cytometry.
Analysis of Foxp3 expression by reverse transcriptionPCR and real-time reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative quantity of mRNA was determined by
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; 28 cycles, One-step RTPCR kit, Qiagen). The mRNA of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the internal control.
The primer sequences were as follows: mouse GAPDH, sense
5′-GTGGAGATTGTTGCCATCAACG-3′, antisense 5′CAGTGGATGCAGGGATG ATGTTCTG-3′; mouse FoxP3
5′-CAAGCAGATCATCTCCTGGATGAG-3′, antisense 5′GAACATGCGAGTAAACCAATGG-3′; human FoxP3, sense
5′-CATG CCTCCTCTTCTTCCTTG-3′, antisense 5′GCTGGTGCATGAAATGTGG C-3′; and human GAPDH,
sense 5′-CCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC-3′, antisense 5′GGT GATGGGATTTCCATTG-3′.

Zhao et al.

For real-time RT-PCR assays, the cDNA sequences of the
murine or the human Foxp3 gene was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. The
primers were designed with the Oligo Primer Analysis 4.0
software and the sequences were blasted (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Real-time RT-PCR was done as previously described (23). The mRNA level of the detected gene
was expressed as the relative level to that of GAPDH.
Intracellular glutathione detection
Total cellular glutathione levels were determined using
the Glutathione Assay kit (Cayman Chemical) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed
by freeze/thawing and protein was precipitated with 5%
5-sulfosalicylic acid solution. Glutathione in the supernatant was quantified by its ability to convert 5,5-dithiobis
(2-nitrobenzoic acid) into the yellow product 2-nitrobenzoic
acid, which was measured spectrophotometrically.
Statistics
Results were expressed as mean value ± SD and interpreted by ANOVA-repeated measure test. Differences were
considered to be statistically significant when P < 0.05.

Results
Treg cells express lower levels of ATP than
conventional T cells
CD4+CD25+ Treg cells and conventional CD4+CD25− T cells
were isolated from the spleens of naïve mice and the intra-

cellular ATP levels were measured. The level of ATP was 8-fold
lower than conventional T cells (Fig. 1A). To confirm these
data in human Treg cells, we analyzed CD4+CD25+CD127−
Treg cells and CD4 + CD25 − CD127 + conventional T cells
isolated from eight normal subjects' peripheral blood. Human Treg cells consistently expressed lower levels of ATP relative to conventional T cells (Fig. 1B). We also measured the
ATP concentration in various cell lines derived from both
mice and humans, and found that all the cell lines had a
higher concentration of intracellular ATP than the cultured
Treg cells (Fig. 1C). To further confirm the alteration of ATP
levels between Treg cells and conventional T cells, the murine CD4+CD25- T cells were induced into CD4+CD25+Foxp3+
Treg cells with the stimulation of anti-CD3 antibody and
TGF-β (28), or human CD4+CD25−CD45RA+ T cells were induced into CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells with the stimulation
of anti-CD3 antibody, ATAR and TGF-β (29). Similarly, the
induced CD4+CD25+ Treg cells expressed lower levels of
ATP, compared with the originally isolated conventional
T cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, Treg cells have intrinsically low levels
of ATP.
Both miR-142-3p and CD39 contribute to the low level
of ATP in Treg cells
Next, we explored the underlying mechanism for the low
levels of ATP in Treg cells. Our previous study showed that
very low levels of miR-142-3p in Treg cells leads to a high
level of adenylyl cyclase 9 and high production of cAMP
(23). Because ATP is the substrate of adenylyl cyclase 9,
it was reasonable to speculate that the low expression of

CD4+CD25+ Treg cells and CD4+CD25− T cells were isolated from the spleen of naïve mice (n = 6), or CD4+CD25+CD127− Treg cells and CD4+CD25−CD127+
T cells were isolated from human PBMCs (n = 8). After 12 h of culture in the presence of 10 ng/mL of IL-2, the intracellular ATP levels in isolated cells

Murine H22 (hepatocarcinoma) and B16 (melanoma) tumor cell lines, and human HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma) and Jurkat (leukemia) tumor cell lines, were

cultured and induced into Treg cells as described in Materials and Methods. The CD4+CD25high T cells were sorted for 12 h culture in the presence of
10 ng/mL of IL-2. The intracellular ATP levels were measured.

ATP Mediates Low-Dose CY that Kills Tregs

Figure 2. miR-142-3p and CD39 contributes to
the low level of ATP in Treg cells. A, Treg cells
and conventional T cells were isolated from
mice and humans. The expression of
miR-142-3p was analyzed by Northern blot.
B, the level of miR-142-3p influences the
concentration of ATP in Treg cells. The isolated
murine or human Treg cells were transfected
with miR-142-3p (left) or miR-142-3p inhibitor
(right). Twenty-four hours later, the intracellular
ATP levels were measured with the somatic
cell ATP assay kit. C, the activity of CD39
influences the concentration of ATP in Treg
cells. The isolated murine or human Treg cells
were treated with CD39 inhibitor ARL67156
(left) or recombinant CD39 (right). Twenty-four
hours later, the intracellular ATP levels were
measured with the somatic cell ATP assay kit.

miR-142-3p contributed to the low levels of ATP in Treg
cells. Consistently, we found, by Northern blot, much higher miR-142-3p in conventional T cells and much lower
miR-142-3p in mouse and human Treg cells (Fig. 2A).
We then transfected CD4+CD25+ Treg cells with miR-1423p and observed, as predicted, an increase in ATP concentration in Treg cells (Fig. 2B, left). On the other hand,
transfecting the inhibitor of miR-142-3p into conventional
T cells resulted in the decrease of intracellular ATP
(Fig. 2B, right). Similar results were also observed in human T cells (Fig. 2B). In addition to miR-142-3p, ectonucleotidase CD39 can catalyze ATP effectively and has
been reported to be mainly expressed on Treg cells rather
than conventional T cells (25, 26), which we have also confirmed (Supplementary Fig. S2). To determine if CD39
plays a role in the maintenance of low levels of ATP in
Treg cells, we tested the CD39 ecto-ATPase inhibitor
ARL67156 (20 μg/mL, Sigma), which resulted in the increase
of ATP in murine and human Treg cells (Fig. 2C, left). In
parallel, we also cultured CD4+CD25− T cells isolated from
mouse spleen or human PBMCs in the presence or absence
of recombinant mouse or human CD39 (0.5 μg/mL; R & D
Systems). Consistently, the addition of CD39 decreased the
concentration of ATP in conventional T cells (Fig. 2C, right).
Taken together, these data showed that both miR-142-3p
and CD39 may contribute to the maintenance of low levels
ATP in Treg cells.

Low-dose CY killing Treg cells is triggered by low level
of ATP
Next, we asked whether low levels of ATP explained the
selective killing of Treg cells by low-dose CY. To address this
question, we first explored whether Treg cells could be selectively killed by low-dose CY in vitro. We found that CY is not
toxic to cultured splenocytes (Supplementary Fig. S3). This
may be due to the fact that CY is a prodrug and needs the
biotransformation in hepatocytes. Therefore, we treated human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 with different concentrations
of CY for 6 hours to generate 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide
and added the supernatants to murine Treg cells and conventional T cells, respectively. Treg cells, but not conventional
T cells, treated with 2 μg/mL activated CY were killed; higher
concentrations killed both Treg cells and conventional T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4; Fig. 3A). Consistently, incubation
with 2 μg/mL CY–treated supernatant resulted in the
depletion of Treg cells rather than conventional CD4+ T cells
in bulk murine splenocytes or human PBMCs, which was
confirmed by both Foxp3 expression and analysis of live
T cells (Fig. 3B–D). In addition, the analysis of apoptotic
T cells showed that the Annexin V+ cells preferentially were
CD4+CD25+ cells after killing by 2 μg/mL CY–treated supernatant (Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, although conventional T cells were not killed by 2 μg/mL CY–treated
supernatant, the transfection of miR-142-3p inhibitor or the
addition of soluble CD39 to the culture medium to decrease

intracellular ATP levels or hydrolyze the extracellular ATP
could result in the killing of conventional T cells by 2 μg/mL
CY–treated supernatant (Supplementary Fig. S6). Taken together, these data indicated that the low-dose active form of
CY generated from hepatocytes may selectively target Treg
cells and such killing seems to connect to energy molecule ATP.
Next, we tested whether the ATP concentration affected
Treg cytotoxicity mediated by 2 μg/mL CY–treated supernatant. We added different concentrations of ATP to the culture system and found that 5 μg/mL ATP rendered Treg
cells resistant to the cytotoxicity induced by 2 μg/mL CY–
treated supernatant (Fig. 4A and B). We also found that the
addition of 5 μg/mL ATP increased the intracellular ATP
concentration in cultured Treg cells to that of conventional
T cells (Fig. 4C). More significantly, in cells from human
subjects, 5 μg/mL ATP enhanced the resistance of Treg cells
to the cytotoxicity induced by 2 μg/mL CY–treated supernatant (Fig. 4A and B). To clarify that the influence of 5 μg/mL
ATP on Treg cells, we tested the apoptosis of Treg cells and
found that apoptosis was not altered by 5 μg/mL ATP (data
not shown). In addition, we here also transfected miR-1423p to Treg cells and found that the resultant increase of intracellular ATP levels conferred Treg cells resistant to the
cytotoxicity induced by 2 μg/mL CY–treated supernatant
(Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data suggested that low level

of ATP guides the selective killing of Treg cells by lowdose CY.
Low levels of ATP decreases the production of
glutathione, leading to the sensitivity of Treg cells to
low-dose CY
Next, we investigated the mechanism by which low levels of
ATP sensitize Treg cells to low-dose CY. The active metabolite
of CY can be detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. We
hypothesized that low level of ATP in Treg cells diminished
the synthesis of glutathione, impairing detoxification and thus
increasing the sensitivity of Treg cells to low-dose CY. To test
this, we compared the levels of glutathione in Treg cells and
conventional T cells, and found that Treg cells had 10-fold less
glutathione than conventional T cells (Fig. 5A). To verify
whether such low glutathione mediates the killing of Treg
cells by low-dose CY, we added glutathione (1 mmol/L) to
Treg cell treated with 2 μg/mL CY–treated supernatant. Addition of glutathione attenuated the sensitivity of Treg cells to
low-dose CY (Fig. 5B, left). In contrast, addition of buthionine sulfoximine (12.5 μmol/L; Sigma), an inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine
synthetase, to the media induced the killing of conventional
T cells by low-dose CY (Fig. 5B, right). Therefore, the decrease
of glutathione may induce the killing of Treg cells by lowdose CY. Glutathione levels were also affected by ATP.

and conventional T cells for 48 h. Then, cells were harvested and stained with FITC-Annexin V for flow cytometric analysis. B to D, HepG2 cell line was
treated with 2 μg/mL of CY for 6 h. The supernatants were used to culture mouse splenocytes or human PBMCs for 48 h. The expressions of Foxp3
were detected by both RT-PCR (B, left) and real-time RT-PCR (B, right), and the numbers of Treg cells (C) and conventional T cells (D) were counted by flow
cytometry.

ATP Mediates Low-Dose CY that Kills Tregs

Figure 4. ATP concentration affects the cytotoxicity of low-dose CY to Treg cells. A and B, HepG2 cell line was treated with 2 μg/mL of CY for 6 h.
The supernatant was used to culture murine splenocytes or human PBMCs in the presence of 0, 1, 5, 25, 125, or 500 μg/mL ATP for 48 h. The expression of
Foxp3 was detected by real-time RT-PCR (A). The data were expressed relative to the cells cultured with normal media, in which the Foxp3 expression
was designed as 1. The Treg cell number was counted by flow cytometry (B). * and #, P < 0.01, compared with the corresponding control group
(neither CY treatment nor ATP addition). C, addition of 5 μg/mL ATP increased the intracellular ATP concentration in cultured Treg cells. HepG2 cell line was
treated with 2 μg/mL of CY. Six hours later, the supernatant was used to culture mouse splenocytes or human PBMCs in the presence of 5 μg/mL ATP.
Twelve hours later, the intracellular ATP levels were measured with the somatic cell ATP assay kit. D, the isolated murine or human Treg cells were
transfected with miR-142-3p. Twenty-four hours later, the transfected cells were cultured with the supernatant of 2 μg/mL CY–treated HepG2 cells for 48 h.
The Treg cell number was counted by flow cytometry.

The addition of 5 μg/mL ATP to culture media increased glutathione in Treg cells to roughly the levels found in conventional T cells (Fig. 5C) and, as shown previously, increased
resistance to low-dose CY. Moreover, although 5 μg/mL
ATP induced the resistance of Treg cells to low-dose CY, this
resistance was counteracted by the addition of buthionine
sulfoximine (Fig. 5D, left and right). Taken together, these data suggested that low levels of ATP decrease the synthesis of
glutathione in Treg cells, thus increasing the sensitivity of
Treg cells to low-dose CY.

Discussion
The molecular basis of the selective killing of Treg cells by
low-dose CY is unclear. In the present study, we provide evidence that the intrinsic low levels of ATP and consequent
low levels of glutathione explain the selective killing of Treg
cells by low-dose CY.
Cells normally keep a steady cytosolic concentration of
ATP. Here, we report that the intracellular concentration of
ATP in Treg cells of either mice or humans, is ∼1 × 10−15 mol
ATP per cell, but that conventional T cells have as much as 4to 5-fold higher ATP concentration. Compared with conventional CD4+ T cells, Treg cells express much lower levels of
miR-142-3p, resulting in elevated synthesis of adenyl cyclase
9, which converts ATP to cAMP (23) and express a much
higher level of CD39 to degrade extracellular ATP (26), which

www.aacrjournals.org

probably facilitates the efflux of cytosolic ATP (30). It is
known that ATP can be released by various nonexcitatory
cells, including T lymphocytes (31, 32). Regardless of that
mechanical stimulation and that agonists promote nonexcitatory cells to release ATP, rest nonsecretory cells also physiologically release ATP. Such basal extracellular ATP levels
probably reflect a dynamic steady state of cells and the hydrolytic action by ecto-ATPase CD39 may lower extracellular
ATP levels. To keep the basal extracellular ATP concentration, more intracellular ATP probably is released, leading to
the decrease of cytosolic ATP. On the other hand, the increase of extracellular ATP levels probably prevents the release of intracellular ATP, leading to the increase of
intracellular ATP levels. In line with this, our data showed
that the addition of ATP increased the intracellular ATP concentration of cultured Treg cells (Fig. 4C). In our present
study, we indeed confirm that miR-142-3p and CD39 are involved in the maintenance of low cytosolic ATP levels in Treg
cells. However, there may be additional Treg-specific mechanisms that contribute to low ATP levels that we have not yet
identified.
One interesting finding in this study is that 5 μg/mL ATP
almost totally rendered Treg cells resistant to the cytotoxicity. However, high-dose ATP (≥25 μg/mL) only conferred
Treg cells a little resistance. Such inconsistency is probably
attributable to that ATP is a signal molecule and may profoundly influence T cells, largely dependent on the quantity

added (33, 34). Yip and colleagues (34) found that although
extracellular ATP could stimulate T cells, the decrease of
ATP to 40 μmol/L concentration (equal to 20 μg/mL) resulted in the loss of stimulatory effect on T cells, suggesting
that extracellular ATP has to reach a certain concentration
for signal transduction. Therefore, in our study, the addition
of a high concentration of ATP (≥25 μg/mL) probably induces signal transduction in Treg cells, leading to the alteration of intracellular ATP or cell death pathway. For instance,
it might be possible that this stimulatory signal promotes intracellular ATP release or increases the apoptosis pathway.
Efflux pump and intracellular metabolism are basically
two major detoxification pathways against chemotherapeutic
agents. Although CD4+ T cells may express ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as ABCB1 (35), which requires
ATP for function (36), CY is a non–P-glycoprotein substrate
drug (37). Therefore, in this study, we did not investigate the
role of ABC transporter in CY-mediated Treg cell killing. We
show that the decreased glutathione contributes to low-dose
CY-mediated Treg cell killing, consistent with previous reports of the antitoxic effect of glutathione in tumor cells
against CY (20, 21). The oxidation of aldophosphamide by aldehyde dehydrogenases is another important detoxification
pathway. The coenzyme NAD+ is required for the catalyzing
activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases. Interestingly, the cytosolic NAD+ concentration has been reported to be dependent
on the concentration of ATP (38). Therefore, aldehyde dehy-

drogenase might be involved in the low-dose CY-mediated
Treg cell killing, which is currently under study.
Treg cells suppress both antitumor and antivirus immunity in patients and murine models. Several lines of evidence
indicate that the interference in Treg biology or depletion of
Treg cells is of critical importance in the treatment of cancer
and viral infection (39–41). A commonly used chemotherapeutic agent CY can selectively deplete Treg cells when administered more frequenty or “metronomically” at a dose
substantially lower than the maximum tolerated dose. Such
low-dose CY is not only immunostimulatory but also avoids
CY high-dose toxicity (16, 42). In addition, the restoration of
Treg numbers and function 10 days after low-dose CY administration implies that a limited period of Treg cell inhibition
may avoid potential autoimmunity (15). These features indicate that low-dose CY administration may be an ideal strategy to target Treg cells in cancer- or virus-infected patients.
In this regard, our present study, shedding light on the underlying mechanism of low-dose CY selectivity for Treg, has
important clinical significance.
In two clinical trials, a single bolus dose of CY combined
with vaccines was administrated to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer (9, 43). Slight decreases in the absolute
number and the percentage of Treg cells were observed. In
contrast, the treatment of nine cancer patients with metronomic low-dose CY showed a selective reduction in Treg cell
numbers and preservation of total number of lymphocytes

Figure 5. The low level of glutathione results in the killing of Treg cells by low-dose CY. A, Treg cells express low levels of glutathione. The isolated murine or
human T cells were used to detect the glutathione level with the glutathione assay kit. Glutathione content was expressed in nmol per 1 × 106 cells.
B, glutathione level influences the sensitivity of Treg cells to low-dose CY. HepG2 cell line was treated with 2 μg/mL of CY. Six hours later, the supernatant
was used to culture Treg cells in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L glutathione (left) or conventional T cells in the presence or absence of 12.5 μmol/L
buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; right) for 48 h for the flow cytometric analysis of FITC-Annexin V+ cells. C, ATP affects the level of glutathione. Treg cells
were cultured in the presence or absence of 5 μg/mL ATP. The glutathione level was measured with glutathione assay kit. D, inhibition of glutathione
synthesis impaired the ATP-induced resistance of Treg cells to low-dose CY. Splenocytes/PBMCs were cultured in the presence or absence of 5 μg/mL
ATP and 12.5 μmol/L buthionine sulfoximine. Forty-eight hours later, the expression of Foxp3 was detected by real-time RT-PCR (left). The data were
expressed relative to the cells cultured with normal media, in which the Foxp3 expression was designed as 1. The Treg cell number was counted by flow
cytometry (right). * and #, P < 0.01, compared with the corresponding control group.

ATP Mediates Low-Dose CY that Kills Tregs

and natural killer cells (16). In our unpublished clinical trial
against HPV infection–derived genital warts, we also found
that by selectively depleting Treg cells, metronomic low-dose
CY effectively prevented the recurrence of warts after laser
therapy. In that clinical trial, Treg cells and conventional
T cells are differentially sensitive to CY. Low-dose CY mostly
affects Treg cells rather than conventional T cells; however,
high-dose CY affects both Treg cells and conventional T cells.
Therefore, the administration of single high-dose CY kills
Treg cells as well as other immune cells, but it may be metabolized within a short time, leading to the recovery of Treg
cells. In contrast, metronomic low-dose CY treatment may
continue to selectively deplete Treg cells. Based on our findings, we suggest that metronomic low-dose CY administration is an ideal approach for Treg cell depletion.
In summary, our data show that a single energy molecule
ATP, by virtue of its differential expression levels in
CD4+CD25+ Treg cells and conventional CD4+ T cells, can
determine the sensitivity of these cells to low-dose CY.
These findings suggest that metronomic low-dose CY
administration may be a safe way to deplete Treg cells for
the treatment of cancers.
