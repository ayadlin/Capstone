Abstract
The AKT signaling pathway is activated in soft tissue sarcoma
(STS). However, AKT blockade has not yet been studied as a
potential targeted therapeutic approach. Here, we examined
the in vitro and in vivo effects of AKT inhibition in STS cells.
Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the expression of
AKT pathway components and the effect of AKT stimulation
and inhibition on their phosphorylation. Cell culture assays
were used to assess the effect of AKT blockade (using a
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor and a specific AKT
inhibitor) on STS cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis.
Oligoarrays were used to determine gene expression changes
in response to AKT inhibition. Reverse transcription–PCR was
used for array validation. Specific small inhibitory RNA was
used to knockdown GADD45A. Human STS xenografts in nude
mice were used for in vivo studies, and immunohistochemistry
was used to assess the effect of treatment on GADD45A
expression, proliferation, and apoptosis. Multiple STS cell
lines expressed activated AKT. AKT inhibition decreased STS
downstream target phosphorylation and growth in vitro; G2
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were also observed. AKT
inhibition induced GADD45a mRNA and protein expression in
all STS cells treated independent of p53 mutational status.
GADD45A knockdown attenuated the G2 arrest induced by
AKT inhibition. In vivo, AKT inhibition led to decreased STS
xenograft growth. AKT plays a critical role in survival and
proliferation of STS cells. Modulation of AKT kinase activity
may provide a novel molecularly based strategy for STStargeted therapies. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2895–903]

Introduction
Use of standard chemotherapy (even in drug combinations) for
soft tissue sarcoma (STS) therapy remains problematic due to
toxicity, expense, and the markedly chemoresistant nature of these
malignancies; the search for better systemic agents is therefore
crucial (1). Molecularly targeted therapy has recently emerged as a
new treatment paradigm that seeks to improve conventional
systemic therapy by specifically and selectively targeting cancers
while minimizing treatment-related morbidities. This approach has
led to successful advances in several diseases, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (2, 3), an STS subtype. To use targeted
therapy for STS, an increased knowledge of potential targets and
their roles in STS progression and metastasis is needed (4, 5).

One potential molecular target is AKT kinase and its signaling
pathways. AKT, also called protein kinase B, is a serine-threonine
kinase activated by phosphorylation of two critical residues:
threonine 308 (T308) located in the activation loop and serine 473
(S473) at the COOH terminal portion of the protein (6, 7). AKT
activation is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
which in turn is activated by a multitude of cell surface receptors
and other related molecules (8–10); the negative regulation of
AKT activation is achieved via tumor suppressor genes, such
as PTEN (11) and Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol
5-phosphatase1/2 (SHIP1/2; ref. 12). The role of AKT has been
investigated in a variety of epithelial origin tumors; upon
phosphorylation, AKT activates downstream pathways that promote protumorigenic, prometastatic processes (13). Activation of
AKT has been found in brain (14), prostate (15), breast (16), lung
(17), liver (18), gastric (19), colon (20), ovarian (21), and
endometrial cancers (22), in association with cancer progression
and chemoresistance. These findings have led to identification of
several specific AKT inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials
for a variety of epithelial malignancies.
Whereas not extensively explored, evidence points to potential
involvement of the AKT pathway in STS development and
progression. Recently, Hernando et al. reported increased expression of activated AKT in a large panel of human leiomyosarcoma,
malignant fibrous histocytoma, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma
(23); using a conditional PTEN knockout mouse model, they
showed a critical role for the AKT pathway in smooth muscle
transformation and leiomyosarcoma development. Tomita et al.
identified a correlation between phosphorylated AKT (pAKT)
expression in human STS specimens and subsequent tumor
recurrence and patient survival (24). These findings suggest that
determining the effect of AKT inhibition on STS in vitro and in vivo
may facilitate inclusion of specific AKT targeted therapy in the
anti-STS treatment armamentarium.
We report that AKT activity blockade induces STS cell growth
inhibition, G2 cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis both in vitro and
in vivo using human STS xenograft murine models. Relevant to STS,
which harbor a high rate of p53 mutations contributory to the STS
chemoresistance phenotype (25), is the finding that antitumor
effects induced by AKT inhibition were observable in both wtp53,
as well as mutated p53 STS cell lines. In addition, we identified a
p53-independent increase in GADD45a, which is at least partially
responsible for AKT-induced STS growth inhibition.

were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured
in DMEM (A204 in McCoy’s 5A) supplemented with 10% FCS (Life
Technologies, Inc.). p53 mutational status of these cells was previously
determined by sequencing.5 The specific AKT kinase inhibitor A674563
(A563) was a kind gift from Abbott Laboratories; the PI3K inhibitor
Ly294002 was purchased from Cayman Chemical. Doxorubicin (Ben Venue
Laboratories) was obtained from the UTMDACC Pharmacy. Recombinant
human epidermal growth factor (EGF; R&D Systems) was used for EGF
receptor (EGFR) stimulation.
Commercially available antibodies were used to detect AKT, pAKT
(S473), pGSK3 (S21/9), pMDM2 (S166), activated caspase-3, PTEN, SHIP2,
EGFR, c-MET, HER2, and insulin-like growth factor-IRa (Cell Signaling);
GADD45a, p53, p21/WAF1, MDM2, GSK3, and h-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Dako Cytomation).
The Dead End Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega) was used for TUNEL
staining. Secondary antibodies included horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated (Universal kit HRP, Biocare Medical) and fluorescent secondary antibodies
(antirabbit Alexa488 and antimouse Alexa 594, Jackson Immuno Research).
Other reagents included CytoQ FC receptor block (Innovex Bioscience),
Hoechst 33342 (Polysciences, Inc.), and propyl gallate (Acros Organics).
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed by standard
methods. Briefly, 25 to 50 Ag of proteins extracted from cultured cells were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.
Membranes were blocked and blotted with relevant antibodies. HRPconjugated secondary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Plc.). IRdye680-conjugated and
IRdye800-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were detected
using Odyssey Imaging (LICOR Biosciences).
Measurement of cell proliferation. Cell growth assays were done using
CellTiter96 cell prolifetation assay kit (Promega) as per manufacturer’s
instructions. STS cell lines were plated at concentrations of 1.5  103 to
4  103 cells per well (depending on cell doubling time) in 96-well plates.
The next day, cells were treated with either 0.1% DMSO as control or
different concentrations of LY294002 or A563 ( for 24, 48, and 72 h).
Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm; absorbance values of
treated cells are presented as a percentage of the absorbance of untreated
cells. Drug concentrations required to inhibit cell growth by 50% (IC50) were
determined by interpolation of dose-response curves.
Cell cycle analysis. STS cell monolayers were treated with relevant
agents for varying time periods. Cells were harvested, washed, and fixed.
Fixed cells were treated with 50 Ag/mL RNase and stained with 50 Ag/mL
propidium iodide for 30 min. Cells were analyzed in a FACSCalibur, and
data were analyzed with Cell Quest and Flowjo software or ModFitLT v3.1
software (Verity Software House).
Apoptosis assay. Apoptosis was measured using the Apoptosis
Detection kit I (BD Biosciences). As a standard, 1  106/mL of cells per
treatment condition were fixed and stained with 5 AL Annexin V–FITC (BD
PharMingen) and 5 AL propidium iodide (Sigma). Flow cytometric analysis
was performed for 1  104 cells and analyzed by FACScan (Becton
Dickinson) using a single laser emitting excitation light at 488 nm. Data
were analyzed by CellQuest software (Becton Dickson).
Caspase-3 apoptosis assay. DEVD-NucView 488 caspase-3 assay kit for
live cells was purchased from Biotium, Inc. Apoptotic cells were detected
per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, STS cells grown on chamber slides
were treated with A563 (1 Amol/L) or DMSO for 24 h. NucView substrate
stock solution (5 AL from 0.2 mmol/L stock) was added to culture medium
and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence was
determined via a florescent microscope using FITC filters, and images
were captured.
Microarray hybridization. Total RNA isolated from STS cells treated
with relevant agents was used to synthesize cDNA as template for
generating Biotin-16-UTP (nonradioactive) labeled cRNA target using
TrueLabeling-AMP linear RNA amplification kit (SuperArray Bioscience

Corporation). Labeled cRNA was purified using SuperArray ArrayGrade
cRNA cleanup kit and quantified by spectrophotometry (1 absorbance unit,
40 Ag/mL). Gene expression profiling was performed using OligoGEArray
Human Cell Cycle OHS-020 (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation). This
microarray is designed to profile the expression of 112 key genes in cell
cycle regulation.6 Prehybridization (2 h) and hybridization (overnight) was
performed in a hybridization oven (60jC) using 4 Ag of labeled cRNA target.
High stringency washing at 60jC (0.1  SSC, 0.5% SDS) was followed by
chemiluminescent detection. The array image was recorded using X-ray film
and a flatbed desktop scanner to create grayscale (16 bits) files in TIFF
format that were analyzed by GEArray Expression Analysis Suite online
software.7
Reverse transcription-PCR. Reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) was
done as previously described (26). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from
cultured STS cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corp.) as per
manufacturer instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using
superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 2 AL of the product
were used as templates for multiplex PCR containing both target
GADD45a and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers for normalization. PCR primers were designed using primer
3 software: GADD45a, 5¶-GGAGAGCAGAAGACCGAAA-3¶ and 5¶-TCACTGGAACCCATTGATC-3¶; GAPDH, 5¶-GAGCCACATCGCTCAGAC-3¶ and 5¶CTTCTCATGGTTCACACCC-3¶. The PCR reaction solution contained
25 AL of Taq PCR Master Mix (Qiagen); 0.2 Amol/L of forward and reverse
primers, respectively; 2 AL of cDNA and double-distilled water to final
volume of 50 AL. PCR consisted of denaturation for 3 min at 94jC, 26 cycles
of denaturation for 30 s at 94jC, annealing for 40 s at 56jC, and an
extension for 50 s at 72jC. PCR cycles were terminated by an extension
at 72jC for 7 min, and products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel.
Small inhibitory RNA knockdown of GADD45A. 5  105 RD cells were
plated per well of six-well plate and incubated overnight at 37jC. The
following morning, SmartPool GADD45a small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) or
nontargeting siRNAs constructs (Dharmacon, Inc.) were transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) reagents according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Mock-transfected cells were treated with Lipofectamine 2000
only. Incubation time for transfection reagents was 24 h, at which time
media was replaced with fresh regular media containing appropriate
inhibitors (A563 or DMSO). The next day, cells were harvested for RT-PCR
and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry.
In vivo therapeutic animal model. All animal procedures and care
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee of
UTMDACC. Animals received humane care as per the Animal Welfare Act
and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Trypan blue
staining–confirmed viable HT1080 STS cells (1  106/0.1 mL HBSS per
mouse) were injected s.c. into the flank of 6-wk-old female nude/nude mice
(National Cancer Institute/NIH; n = 20). Subcutaneous tumors were
measured twice weekly by digital caliper; tumor volume was calculated as
V = L  W 2  p / 6, where V is volume, L is length, and W is width. When
average subcutaneous tumor volume reached f100 mm3, mice were
assigned into two treatment groups (n = 10): (a) control (vehicles only) and
(b) A563 (20 mg/kg/bid, gavage). Mice were followed for tumor size and
body weight and were sacrificed when control group tumors reached an
average of 1.5 cm in largest dimension. Tumor was resected, weighed, and
frozen or fixed in formalin and paraffin embedded for further immunohistochemical studies.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (27). Briefly, paraffin sections were dewaxed
and rehydrated before antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase activity
was quenched with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide before blocking with horse
serum. Staining with primary antibodies (described above) was done at
concentrations based on manufacturer’s recommendation. Biotinylated
secondary antibodies were applied at 1:200 before ABC peroxidase system

application (Vectastain ABComplex; Vector Laboratories, Inc.), 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine color development (Sigma Chemical Co.), and Mayer’s
hematoxylin counterstaining. For immunofluorencence staining, fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies were used, followed by nuclear
staining with Hoechst. In situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied
Science) was used as per manufacturer’s instructions for TUNEL assay.
Staining distribution and intensity were evaluated and scored by two
independent reviewers (B.K. and Q.Z.). Photographs were obtained using a
Leica DM4000B microscope (Leica Microsystems, Gmb) and a Leica HCxPLS-APO 40/0.75 numerical aperture objective lens. Images were captured
using SPOT digital camera and were processed using SPOT advanced
acquisition software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.).
Statistical analysis. Cell culture assays were repeated at least thrice, and
means F SD was calculated. Cell lines were examined separately. For
outcomes that were measured at a single time point, two sample t tests were
used to assess the differences. Differences in xenograft growth in vivo were
assessed using a two-tailed Student’s t test. Significance was set at P V 0.05.

Results
STS cell lines express activated AKT. Previous reports have
suggested a possible role for AKT activation in STS (24). To study
the effect of AKT inhibition on STS cell growth, we initially
evaluated the expression of pAKT in a panel of human STS cell
lines of diverse histology (Fig. 1A). AKT activation to varying levels
was demonstrable in all STS cells examined by immunobloting for
the pAKT S473 epitope. Moreover, increased AKT phosphorylation
was observed when STS cells were under serum starvation
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1). Serum-independent pAKT
expression is possibly an even better discriminator of STS cell AKT
dependence.

www.aacrjournals.org

There are multiple molecular mechanisms which could possibly
result in the activation of AKT. Dysregulation in intrinsic
components of the PI3K-AKT pathway, e.g., PTEN mutation
resulting in the loss/dysfunction of the PI3K-negative regulator
PTEN protein, has been identified in many cancers. Although not
well described in STS, some evidence suggests that PTEN is
dysregulated in STS, especially leiomyosarcomas (23). Screening
human STS cells8 for PTEN expression (Fig. 1B), we observed that
two cell lines (MES-SA, uterine sarcoma and its derivative MESSA-Dx, and SW872, liposarcoma) do not exhibit PTEN protein. It is
possible that the loss of PTEN in these cells is at least partially
responsible for their pAKT expression. Similarly, we screened cells
for the expression of another phosphatase that negatively regulates
PI3K, SHIP2 (Fig. 1B). All STS cells were found to express SHIP2. As
with STS cells expressing PTEN, we cannot exclude the possibility
that loss of function, rather than loss of expression, of these
phosphatases per se contributes to AKT activation.
The AKT pathway is a common point of convergence for a
multitude of upstream activators, such as tyrosine kinase receptors,
several of which have been previously shown to be dysregulated in
STS (28, 29). For example, Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) showed
that all STS cells evaluated in the current study express at least one
of the growth factor receptors examined and that most express
multiple such receptors. Thus, it is possible that upstream
modulators are at least partially responsible for the AKT

phosphorylation observed in the STS cell lines. Moreover,
stimulation of upstream receptors with an appropriate ligand
(i.e., EGF/EGFR; Fig. 1C) can induce further AKT phosphorylation.
These findings are of special importance in that the tumor
microenvironment is rich in cytokines secreted by a variety of cells
composing the tumor stroma, suggesting that AKT could possibly
be even more activated in vivo.
To further evaluate whether AKT activation is of significance in
STS cells, we examined the phosphorylation status of downstream
AKT targets, such as MDM2 and GSK3. As shown in Fig. 1D,
phosphorylation of MDM2 at Ser166 and phosphorylation of GSK3
at Ser21 (a subunit) and Ser9 (h subunit) were detectable at varying
levels in all STS cell lines. These data suggest that AKT kinase is
activated and functional in STS cells, mediating intracellular
signaling and downstream target phosphorylation.
AKT blockade results in decreased STS cell downstream
target phosphorylation and tumor cell growth inhibition. Next,
we wanted to evaluate the effect of AKT inhibition on STS cells.
Utilizing a commercially available inhibitor of the AKT activator
PI3K (LY294002), we were able to show a dose-dependent reduction
in AKT phosphorylation in all STS cell lines tested (Fig. 2A). As
suggested above, these data indicate that phosphorylation of AKT
in STS is dependent upon PI3K activity. Treatment of the different
STS cell lines with increasing doses (0.1–10 Amol/L) of LY294002
resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation, as was
identified by MTS assay, with IC50s (at 48 h) ranging from 3.5 to
7.5 Amol/L (data not shown).

Whereas PI3K blockade results in effective inhibition of AKT
phosphorylation, it is not specific and possibly affects other
signaling pathways (30, 31). Therefore, we next analyzed the
efficacy of a specific AKT inhibitor, A563 (32). This compound is an
ATP competitor that binds to the ATP site of the AKT kinase
domain, inhibiting AKT-catalyzed phosphorylation activity. As
depicted in Fig. 2B, A563 does not inhibit AKT phosphorylation
per se, but blocks the phosphorylation of AKT downstream targets
in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure of STS cells to increasing
doses of A563 significantly decreased GSK3 and MDM2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). No effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase
phosphorylation could be observed in STS cells after A563
treatment (data not shown).
Next, we determined the effect AKT activity blockade induced by
A563 on STS cell proliferation. We examined the sensitivity of the
different cell lines exposed to increasing concentrations of A563 for
varying lengths of time (24, 48, and 72 hours). Our results indicate
that all STS cell lines were sensitive to A563, with the IC50 values
at 48 hours ranging from 0.22 F 0.034 Amol/L (SW684) to 0.35 F
0.06 Amol/L (SKLMS1; Fig. 2C). AKT inhibition induced growth
inhibition in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner
(Fig. 2D). Cells expressing the highest level of pAKT (RD, MESSA, and SW684; see densitometry in Fig. 1A) were found to be most
sensitive to this inhibition. Additionally, because p53 mutations are
the most common genetic alteration in STS and p53 mutated
STS are more therapeutically resistant, it is important that no
significant differences in response to A563 could be found when

comparing STS cells bearing wtp53 (HT1080, A204, MES-SA)
versus mutated p53 genes (SKLMS1, RD, SW684, SW872). This
observation suggests the possible importance of further investigating the AKT inhibition-induced p53-independent pathway
in STS.
AKT activity inhibition induces G2 cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in STS cells. Based on the observed effect of A563 on
STS cell growth, we next evaluated the effect of A563 on STS cell
cycle progression and apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis after treatment
of STS cell lines with A563 using propidium iodide staining/
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)–induced G2 cell cycle
arrest in all STS cells tested (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). Additionally, an
increase in apoptotic cells (cells in G0–sub-G1) could also be
observed. When treating STS cells with A563, we observed clear
morphologic changes, i.e., loss of elongated shape and cytoplasmic
and nuclear condensation, confirming A563-induced apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S2). To further quantitatively evaluate the

www.aacrjournals.org

effect of A563 on STS cell apoptosis, we used an Annexin V
apoptosis detection assay (Fig. 3B). AKT inhibition induced
significant early and late apoptosis in all STS cell lines tested
(P < 0.01; Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis showed increase in
caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 3C), and using a NucView 488 caspase-3
assay kit, we detected apoptosis in living cells when treated with
AKT kinase inhibitor, as shown in Fig. 3D. Similar to the cell
growth assays, the effect of A563 on the cell cycle and apoptosis
observed in the STS cells was independent of p53 mutational
status, suggesting that these findings cannot solely be explained by
wtp53 stabilization found to occur secondary to AKT inhibition
(33). Taken together, these data indicate that AKT activity is highly
correlated to proliferation and survival of STS cells. AKT blockade
is effective in significantly inhibiting STS cell proliferation, as well
as induction of G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
AKT inhibition up-regulated the expression of GADD45A
independent of p53. To identify possible AKT downstream

modulators responsible for the effect of AKT blockade on STS G2
cell cycle arrest in both wtp53 and mutp53 cells, we used
the commercial Human Cell Cycle OligoGEArray to determine the
expression profile of a panel of genes involved in cell cycle
progression. Human RD cells (mutp53) and MES-SA cells (wtp53)
were treated with A563 (1 Amol/L/12 hours), and total RNA from
treated and untreated cells was used to identify changes in gene
expression (Supplementary Fig. S3). Our results showed that
GADD45a, a gene encoding for the growth arrest and DNA damage
45a protein, was the only gene up-regulated in both cell lines
(5.69 F 0.09–fold in MES-SA and 2.37 F 0.62–fold in RD); therefore,
we elected to study its possible role in AKT blockade-induced
effects. Initially, we wanted to confirm the Oligoarray results in RD
and MES-SA cell lines, as well as evaluate whether the GADD45a
increase could also be seen in other human STS cells. Increase in
GADD45a mRNA expression level after A563 treatment was
identified in all STS cell lines tested (MES-SA, HT1080, A204wtp53 and RD, SW684, SKLMS1-mutp53; Fig. 4A). Furthermore,
Western blot analysis showed that the changes observed in mRNA
expression were translated to an increase in GADD45a protein
levels in all STS cell lines treated with A563 (Fig. 4B). Our data also
indicate that GADD45a induction can be observed after treatment
with low doses of A563 (0.1 Amol/L) in both wtp53 and mutp53
cells (Fig. 4C), whereas p21 increase occurs only after exposure
to a higher A563 dose and is dependent on p53 mutational status.
As its name implies, GADD45a has a role in cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in response to DNA damage in eukaryotic cells (34). The
GADD45a gene was the first ever described p53 response gene; it
was found to be transcriptionally up-regulated by p53 via a p53
consensus-binding site located in the third intron of the GADD45a
gene (35). It has also been reported to be regulated in a p53independent manner (34). To further evaluate whether the increase
in GADD45a observed in STS cells after AKT inhibition is a general
stress response or whether it is a specific response to AKT
inhibition in these cells, we compared the effect of doxorubicin (the
most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment
of STS) on GADD45a expression to that of A563 (Fig. 4D).

Doxorubicin treatment resulted in an increase in GADD45a only in
wtp53 STS cell lines (A204 and MES-SA). The chemotherapy
induced stabilization and increase in p53 levels accompanied by
increased p21 levels in these cells suggests that the wtp53 pathway
is at least partially intact. Although not the focus of this
manuscript, the lack of doxorubicin-mediated GADD45a induction
in mutp53 cells (RD and SKLMS1) might possibly offer an
additional explanation of our previous observation of increased
doxorubicin resistance in STS harboring mutp53 (36, 37). In
contrast, treatment with the AKT inhibitor increased the
expression of GADD45a in both wtp53 and mutp53 cell lines,
whereas p21 was only induced in wtp53 cells. These data suggest
that AKT inhibition–induced up-regulation of GADD45a in STS
cells is specific and independent of wtp53 protein function.
GADD45A knockdown attenuates G2 arrest induced by AKT
inhibition. To further study whether AKT inhibition–induced
GADD45a up-regulation is of functional significance in STS cells,
we used smartpool siRNA directed against human GADD45a
mRNA to knockdown its endogenous and inducible expression. RD
cells were mock-transfected, transfected with nontargeting siRNA,
or transfected with GADD45a smart pool siRNA for 24 hours, at
which point cells were treated with 0.1%DMSO or A563 (1 Amol/L)
for an additional 24 hours; cells were then harvested for total RNA
isolation and for cell cycle analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, RT-PCR
showed that endogenous and AKT inhibition–induced GADD45a
mRNA was knocked down effectively (>86% as measured by
densitometry) after siRNA GADD45a transfection. Furthermore,
when the cells were subjected to cell cycle analysis by FACS
(Fig. 5B), GADD45a knockdown attenuated the AKT inhibition–
induced G2 arrest. These data suggest that AKT inhibition–induced
GADD45a is at least partially responsible for the observed G2 cell
cycle arrest in response to A563 in STS cells.
AKT blockade decreases STS growth in vivo. To investigate if
the effect of A563 on STS cells in culture can also be recapitulated
in vivo, therapeutic animal studies were conducted using human
fibrosarcoma (HT1080) subcutaneous xenografts. Treatment with
A563 (20 mg/kg/bid, p.o.) was initiated when tumors reached

expression of GADD45a. A, increase in
GADD45a mRNA in STS cells is shown
(RT-PCR) after treatment with A563
(1 Amol/L/12 h). B, similarly, an increase
in GADD45a protein is observed after
A563 treatment (1 Amol/L/24 h; Western
blot analysis). C, A563 (24 h) induces
GADD45a expression in both wtp53
(MES-SA) and mutp53 (RD) STS cell
lines, whereas A563-induced expression
of p21 occurs only with a higher A563 dose
and in cells harboring wtp53 (Western
blot analysis). D, doxorubicin induces
GADD45a, as well as p53 and p21
expression, only in wtp53 STS cells
(A204 and MES-SA). A563-induced
GADD45a is p53 status independent,
whereas A563-induced p21 expression is
observed only in wtp53 cells (Western
blot analysis). All figure panels are
representative of three independent
experiments.

G2 Arrest in STS Cells in Response to AKT Inhibition

Figure 5. GADD45a knockdown attenuates G2 arrest induced by AKT inhibition.
A, GADD45a siRNA transfection to RD cells decreased constitutive and
A563-induced GADD45a expression compared with mock (Lipofectamine only)
or nontargeting siRNA transfection (RT-PCR). B, AKT inhibition–induced G2
arrest was attenuated by GADD45a knockdown. RD cells transfected with
nontargeting siRNA (top ) exhibit increased G2 arrest after A563 treatment
(1 Amol/L/24 h). No significant G2 arrest was observed in GADD45a siRNA
transfected cells (bottom ) after treatment with A563 (propidium iodide/FACS
analysis). All figure panels are representative of three independent experiments.

5 mm, tumor growth was compared with those of mice treated
with vehicle only (5% dextrose). A563-treated mice exhibited slower
tumor growth (Fig. 6A) and a significant difference in tumor
volume at the termination of the study (320.76 F 86.8) compared
with that in control group (667.92 F 97.41; P < 0.01). No significant
weight loss was observed in A563-treated mice compared with
control groups. Death occurred in one of the A563-treated mice.
H&E staining of tumor specimens revealed pronounced tumor
necrosis in A563-treated groups (Fig. 6B, a and b). Sections
containing viable tumor cells were then selected for further
immunohistochemical studies. A563-treated tumors were found to
express increased levels of GADD45a (Fig. 6B, c and d) and
decreased levels of PCNA (a nuclear marker for proliferation;
Fig. 6B, e and f ). Additionally, an increase in TUNEL assay staining
levels (marker for apoptosis) in the A563-treated specimens was
observed (Fig. 6B, g and h). Taken together, these data suggest that
AKT blockade results in significant STS tumor growth inhibition,
an observation of potential clinical utility.

Discussion
Overall STS patient survival is f50% at 5 years depending upon
tumor size, histology, grade, location, and presence of regional or
distant disease. Development of lung metastasis is particularly
ominous, accounting for f80% of sarcoma-specific deaths with
the remainder attributable to aggressive local STS effects (38). The

www.aacrjournals.org

need to successfully control STS growth and dissemination via
systemic approaches remains compelling but is hampered by the
availability of few drugs available with meaningful STS efficacy;
toxicity ratios and new and effective systemic agents are crucially
needed. Several reports suggest a possible role for activated AKT
in STS development and progression (39–41), rendering it a
potentially attractive therapeutic target. It is therefore encouraging
that our studies show that AKT signaling pathway blockade results
in STS cell G2 arrest and apoptosis in vitro, as well as inhibition of
STS growth in vivo. AKT blockade combined with conventional
chemotherapy should be explored in STS; such combinations have
shown effectiveness in other tumors (42, 43).
STS include >50 distinct histologic subtypes, which are grouped
together due to their shared putative mesenchymal origin and
unique clinical behaviors which distinguish them from the more
common epithelial tumors. Due to their relative rarity (<1% of
adult solid tumors), it is difficult to accrue sufficient numbers of
individual STS histiotype patients needed to study the efficacy
of new therapies. We have shown high expression of pAKT in STS
cells of different histologic origin, perhaps due to an array of
upstream modulators which could vary between different STS
histiotypes. Functioning as a common convergence point of
multiple dysregulated pathways operative in various STS, AKT
per se may be more useful than its various upstream modulators
as a target for STS therapy.
The effect of AKT inhibition on STS cells was reproducible using
either Ly294002, a PI3K inhibitor, or A563, a potent direct inhibitor
of AKT kinase activity. Whereas the effect of Ly294002 could be due
to the inhibition of other PI3K downstream pathways, A563 is
highly selective for the AKT pathway, suggesting its observed
effects are directly related to AKT inhibition. However encouraging
these results are in supporting our hypothesis, A563 cannot be used
in the clinical arena. Others have shown that mice could not
tolerate A563 for longer than 25 days, thereafter becoming
moribund. Whereas a significant A563 effect on tumor growth
was observed, tumors regrew rapidly upon A563 cessation (32). The
dose-limiting toxicities of A563 and other pan-AKT inhibitors are
mainly due to the physiologic role of AKT in insulin signaling and
glucose metabolism (32, 44). Efforts to develop specific high affinity
AKT inhibitors with less toxic side effects are currently under way.
It may be a possible approach to use specific AKT1 inhibitors in
lieu of pan-AKT inhibitors, such as A563. AKT2 inhibition is
perhaps the major cause of A563 toxic effects and predominates in
insulin signaling; whereas AKT null mice develop typical type II
diabetes, AKT1 null mice do not (32).
Another approach to reducing severe metabolic side effects is via
inhibiting individual AKT downstream substrates. There are
caveats to such approaches: critical AKT downstream effectors
may vary between different STS histiotypes or even within the same
subtype, and inhibiting individual downstream components of the
AKT pathway may miss key entities that are involved in the AKTinduced STS-promoting effects. However, encouraging preliminary
results using mTOR inhibitors (a down stream target of AKT) in
phase I/phase II clinical trials for advanced STS (45) suggests the
feasibility of this approach and supports further study of
potentially significant AKT downstream substrates in STS.
In the current study, we have identified GADD45a as a common
AKT downstream target up-regulated after AKT inhibition in STS
cells of different histologic background and p53 mutational status.
The exact function of GADD45a, one of several growth arrest–
inducible and DNA damage–inducible proteins, and its expression

and role in STS is not well elucidated. It has been implicated in G2
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, thereby serving as a tumor
suppressor (46). GADD45a interacts with several important
intracellular signaling molecules, such as proliferating cell nuclear
antigen, cyclin B/CDC2 complex, p21/WAF1, histone, and aurora-A
kinase, all of which participate in the regulation of DNA replication,
DNA repair, and cell cycle progression (47). Our studies show that
the GADD45a increase in response to AKT blockade at least
partially mediates the anti-STS AKT inhibition–induced G2 cell
cycle arrest. It is possible that loss of GADD45a expression and
function in STS due to increased activated AKT may play a role in
the dysregulated cell cycle progression of these tumors.
AKT-induced suppression of GADD45a, as well as AKT blockadeinduced GADD45a, has not yet been extensively explored and may
be due to several molecular mechanisms. AKT blockade is known to
up-regulate and stabilize wtp53 expression through the inhibition of
MDM2 phosphorylation (7); GADD45a is a known transcriptional
downstream target of wtp53; however, this cannot solely explain the
AKT inhibition–induced GADD45a, which also occurs in mutp53
cells. FOXO3 has also been identified as a GADD45a transcription
activator (34, 48). AKT inhibition induces the translocation of
cytoplasmic FOXO3 to the nucleus, thus increasing its transcriptional activity; previously. FOXO3 has been shown to increase
GADD45a expression (34). In our studies, we have failed to show

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

FOXO3 expression or subcellular localization in STS cells in response
to AKT inhibition (data not shown); however, it is possible that other
FOXO family members having similar functions might play a role in
STS. Additionally, AKT inhibition–induced post transcriptional
mechanisms resulting in GADD45a mRNA stability are also possible.
For example, Zheng et al. (49) reported that nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB) inhibition resulted in posttranscriptional stabilization of
GADD45a mRNA; AKT blockade inhibited the function of NF-nB
(50). Current studies in our laboratory are investigating the
STS-specific mechanisms resulting in AKT-induced GADD45a
suppression and AKT inhibition–induced GADD45a.
In summary, we show that AKT inhibition results in significant
antitumor activity against human STS in vitro and in vivo. Our
results suggest the possibility of AKT blockade as a promising
therapeutic intervention for the treatment of patients burdened by
this disease.
