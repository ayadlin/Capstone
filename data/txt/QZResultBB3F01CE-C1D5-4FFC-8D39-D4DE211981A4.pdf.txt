Abstract
The continuous release of bone-stored growth factors after bone resorption promotes the colonization of
circulating cancer cells. However, the precise role of each of the various growth factors remains unclear. In this
study, we investigated the role of bone-derived insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in the development of bone
metastases in an animal model of breast cancer. We found that local stimulation of calvarial bone resorption
before cell inoculation stimulated subsequent bone metastases to that site in vivo, although inhibition of bone
resorption inhibited bone metastases. Anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells was stimulated by the
culture supernatants from resorbed bones, which contained elevated levels of IGF-I. This stimulation was blocked
by IGF type I receptor (IGF-IR) neutralizing antibody, but not antibody targeting other bone-stored growth factors
including TGF-b, ﬁbroblast growth factors, and platelet-derived growth factors. Although recombinant human
IGF-I caused IGF-IR tyrosine autophosphorylation, followed by activation of Akt and NF-kB in cancer cells,
dominant-negative inhibition of IGF-IR, Akt, or NF-kB signiﬁcantly reduced bone metastases with increased
apoptosis and decreased mitosis in metastatic cells. Together, our ﬁndings suggest that bone-derived IGF-I
bridges the crosstalk between bone and metastasized cancer cells via activation of the IGF-IR/Akt/NF-kB
pathway. Disruption of this pathway therefore may represent a promising therapeutic intervention for bone
metastasis. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4238–49. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Bone is one of the most common target sites of distant
metastasis of breast, prostate, and lung cancer (1–3). Bone
metastasis represents one of the major causes of morbidity
such as intractable bone pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord
compression, and hypercalcemia in cancer patients. Accumulated clinical and experimental data that speciﬁc inhibitors of
osteoclasts including bisphosphonates (BP) effectively suppress osteolytic bone metastases (4, 5) suggest that osteoclastic
bone destruction plays a critical role in the development and
progression of bone metastases.

Bone is a storehouse of a variety of growth factors such as
insulin-like growth factors (IGF), TGF-b, ﬁbroblast growth
factors (FGF), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), and
bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP; refs. 6 and 7). Our group
showed that TGF-b is released in active forms after bone
resorption in organ cultures of neonatal mouse calvarial bones
(8), verifying that bone-stored growth factors are released by
osteoclastic bone resorption.
Several lines of evidence suggest that colonization of cancer
cells in bone is under the inﬂuence of bone-derived growth
factors. For example, bone-derived TGF-b has been shown to
activate TGF-b-Smad signaling pathway in metastatic breast
cancer cells in bone leading to increased parathyroid hormonerelated protein (PTHrP) production in these breast cancer cells
(9, 10), which in turn enhances osteoclastogenesis and bone
destruction through an upregulation of receptor activator of
NF-kB ligand (RANKL) expression in neighboring osteoblasts
(11). RANKL in osteoblasts then functionally interacts with
RANK expressed in preosteoclasts and mature osteoclasts,
causing increased osteoclast formation and bone resorption.
Consequently, growth factors are further released from resorbing bone and promote colonization of metastatic cancer cells
in bone. Accordingly, it has been proposed that an establishment of so-called "vicious cycle" between metastatic cancer
cells and bone is a requisite for the development of bone
metastases (1–3). However, the contributions of bone-stored
growth factors other than TGF-b to bone metastasis are still
poorly understood. Moreover, dissection of cancer cell
responses to these bone-derived growth factors in the

Bone-Derived IGF Promotes Breast Cancer Bone Metastases

development of bone metastases is important to understand
the mechanism of bone metastases and to design novel therapeutic approaches for bone metastases.
IGFs, which are the most abundant growth factors stored in
bone (6, 7), have been implicated in the development, progression, and aggressiveness of many types of cancers including breast cancer (12, 13). Therefore, the role of IGFs in bone
metastasis is of particular interest and worthwhile studying.
IGFs initiate its actions primarily through binding to IGF type
I receptors (IGF-IR; refs. 12 and 13). Clinical studies described
that the majority of cancers express IGF-IR (14) and that the
expression levels are signiﬁcantly higher in tumors than
neighboring normal tissues (15). Experimental studies
showed that the activation of IGF-IR signaling pathways
promotes cancer growth and metastasis (16). Conversely,
inhibition of IGF-IR signaling suppressed tumor aggressiveness (17). These results suggest that IGF-IR expression
and activation of its signaling pathway are critical to the
promotion of malignant behaviors of cancers. Accordingly,
IGF-IR and its downstream pathway have been thought to be
promising targets for cancer therapy and varieties of antagonists, inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies are currently under
clinical evaluation (12, 13).
In this study, we attempted to determine the role of bonederived IGFs and IGF-IR signaling pathway in responding
breast cancer cells in the development of bone metastases in
a preclinical setting using a well-characterized animal model
(4). We found that the bone-derived IGFs stimulated bone
metastases of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells
through stimulation of cell proliferation and inhibition of
apoptosis. These effects of IGFs were elicited via the activation
of the serine/threonine kinase Akt and the transcription factor
NF-kB. Akt and NF-kB are known to be activated by IGFs and
promote cell survival (12, 13, 18–21). Disruption of the activation of IGF-IR, Akt, or NF-kB signiﬁcantly inhibited bone
metastases. Our results suggest that an activation of IGF-IR
signaling by bone-derived IGFs promotes bone metastases of
breast cancer. IGF-IR signaling pathway could thus be a wellrationalized target in the development of pharmacological
therapeutic agents for bone metastasis.

Cell culture
Human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were
expanded and stored according to the supplier's instructions,
and used within 2 months after resuscitation of frozen aliquots.
MDA-231AD cells, a MDA-MB-231 clone that is reproducibly
and highly metastatic to bone and adrenal glands, was
described previously (23). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% FBS (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution
(Life Technologies) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2
in air.
Stimulation of calvarial bone resorption in organ culture
The details of this culture technique have been described
previously (24). In brief, calvariae were excised from 6-day-old
pups of BALB/c mice (Harlan), dissected free of adjacent
connective tissues, placed in serum-free Biggers-GwatokinJackson medium (BGJb; Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.1% BSA
and cultured with or without 100 pmol/L IL-1b for 48 hours in
the absence or presence of 1 mmol/L ZOL. The conditioned
medium (CM) harvested from IL-1b-treated or -untreated
calvarial bones was designated resorbed or unresorbed bone
CM, respectively and frozen at 20 C until use.
Colony formation assay
Anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231 cells was
determined by colony formation in soft agar as described (25).
MDA-MB-231 cells (500 cells/well/24-well plate) were cultured
in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and control bone or
resorbed bone CM (20%, v/v) in the absence or presence of 5
mg/mL neutralizing antibodies to TGF-b, IGF-IR, FGF-1, FGF-2,
or PDGF-BB in soft agar for 14 days. CM and antibodies were
added to the cultures every 3 and 7 days, respectively. At the
end of culture, colonies >200 mm in diameter were manually
counted under inverted microscope.
Measurements of PTHrP and IGF-I
PTHrP production by MDA-MB-231 clones was measured
as described (9). PTHrP concentrations were determined
using a 2-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA; Nichols
Institute or Mitsubishi Chemical) according to manufacturer's instruction. IGF-I concentrations were measured
using a commercial RIA kit (American Laboratory Products
Company).
Transfection
Cell transfection was carried out as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Wild-type IGF-IR gene was
stably transfected into parental MDA-MB-231 cells and dominant-negative mutants of IGF-IR (IGF-IR/486STOP), Akt (DNAkt), and inhibitor of kBa (IkBaDN) were into MDA-231AD
cells.
Tumor inoculation
Tumor cell inoculation was carried out as described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods. All animal protocols
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use

Radiographic analysis
Development of bone metastases was monitored by X-rays
as described previously (4).
Histological and histomorphometric analysis
Parafﬁn sections of the hindlimbs were made after conventional methods. Histomorphometric analyses of metastatic
tumor burden in bone, apoptosis, and mitosis of MDA-MB231 cells, and osteoclast number in bone metastases were
carried out as described previously (4).
IGF-IR immunohistochemistry
Fifteen clinical samples of bone metastases were obtained at
the time of surgery at Osaka University Hospital (Osaka, Japan).
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine. Immunohistochemical staining of parafﬁn sections was carried out
using Histoﬁne Simple Stain Kit (Nichirei Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Chromogen was developed
using DAB Liquid System (Dako). The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. The immunoreactivity was evaluated as negative () or positive (þ).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blotting (WB) were
carried out as described previously (26).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was carried out
as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean  SEM. The data were
analyzed by 1-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's PLSD post hoc
test (StatView; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for determination of
differences between groups. Student t test or Welch t test was
conducted when 2 groups were compared. P values of <0.05
were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Effects of bone resorption on the development of bone
metastases
We previously described that MDA-MB-231 cells rarely
metastasized to calvarial bones after intracardiac inoculation
for unknown reasons (7). Taking advantage of this feature, we
examined whether stimulation of calvarial bone resorption in
advance modulates the subsequent development of bone
metastases to this rare site. Bone resorption was stimulated
by the repeated subcutaneous injections of IL-1b over the
calvariae (Fig. 1A). This treatment induced no evident stimulation of bone resorption in other bones than calvariae at
radiologic and histologic levels and did not cause hypercalcemia (27). Thus, the effects of IL-1b were restricted to the

4240

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

calvarial bones. Twenty-four hours after the last injection of
IL-1b, MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated into the left cardiac
ventricle in female nude mice (Fig. 1A). At day 28, mice treated
with IL-1b before cell inoculation showed macroscopic tumor
formation on the calvariae (Fig. 1B). Radiographic examination
revealed multiple osteolytic lesions on the calvarial bones
(Fig. 1C). Quantitative assessment of these osteolytic lesions
showed that stimulation of calvarial bone resorption by IL-1b
before to cell inoculation signiﬁcantly increased osteolytic area
(Fig. 1C). Histologic examination showed that these osteolytic
lesions were colonized by metastatic cancer cells with destruction of calvarial bones by numerous osteoclasts (Fig. 1D),
verifying that these osteolytic lesions represent bone metastases. Mice received repeated IL-1b injections on their calvarial
bone but no subsequent intracardiac inoculation of cancer
cells exhibited no development of osteolytic lesions at day 28
(data not shown). However, we observed discernible increase
in calvarial bone formation probably as a consequence of IL1b-stimulated bone resorption as described in the previous
report (27). IL-1b administered together with the BP ZOL, a
potent and speciﬁc inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption
(5), showed signiﬁcant reduction of osteolytic bone metastases
on calvarial bones (Fig. 1C). ZOL alone with no IL-1b injections,
followed by intracardiac inoculation of MDA-MB-231 cells
showed no effects on calvarial bones, since no osteolytic bone
metastases were developed on the calvarial bones in the
absence of IL-1b injections. However, under these circumstances, osteolytic bone metastases developed in the proximal
tibiae that are one of the representative sites of bone metastasis in this animal model and zoledronic acid signiﬁcantly
reduced these osteolytic bone metastases (data not shown).
These results suggest that the stimulation of bone resorption
stimulates bone metastases, whereas inhibition of bone resorption inhibits them.
Effects of resorbed bone CM on MDA-MB-231 cells
We next attempted to identify a bone-derived factor that is
released after stimulation of bone resorption and is responsible
for stimulation of bone metastases. To study this, neonatal
mouse calvarial bones were placed in organ cultures in the
presence or absence of IL-1b with or without ZOL, and the CM
was harvested and tested for their capacity to stimulate MDAMB-231 cell behaviors. Earlier studies from our group reported
that bone resorption of neonatal mouse calvariae was stimulated under this experimental condition (24) and that bonestored growth factors are released in the culture medium in
active forms (8).
To examine the effects of the CM on cell growth, we carried
out the colony formation assay in soft agar. This assay has been
widely used for determining in vitro tumorigenicity of cancer
cells (28) and shown to correlate well with in vivo tumorigenicity. The resorbed bone CM (20%, v/v) markedly stimulated
the anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in
soft agar compared with the control bone CM (Fig. 2A). The
effects of the resorbed bone CM were dose-dependent between
concentrations of 10% to 50% (v/v; data not shown). The CM
harvested from the cultures treated with both IL-1b and ZOL
showed profoundly reduced activity compared with those

and were signiﬁcantly decreased in the presence of ZOL (Fig.

collectively suggest that IGFs released from bone as a consequence of bone resorption are responsible for the promotion of
anchorage-independent growth in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells.

Role of IGF/IGF-IR in bone metastases of MDA-MB-231
cells
To examine the role of IGFs in the development of bone
metastases in vivo, we ﬁrst established 2 MDA-MB-231 clones
(Cl. 1 and Cl. 2) stably transfected with the dominant-negative
IGF-IR (MDA/486STOP). In MDA/486STOP cells, expression of
the endogenous IGF-IR was not altered compared with the
empty vector-transfected cells (MDA/EV; Fig. 3A, bottom left,
thin arrow); however, tyrosine autophosphorylation of IGF-IR
induced by IGF-I was almost abolished (Fig. 3A, top left) in
conjunction with the expression of large amounts of the
dominant-negative IGF-IR (IGF-IR/486STOP; Fig. 3A, bottom
left, thick arrow). IGF-IR/486STOP was secreted into the
culture medium from MDA/486STOP cells because of a lack
of transmembrane domain (Fig. 3A, right), which competitively
inhibited the binding of IGFs to the endogenous IGF-IR (17).
We then examined the capacity of MDA/486STOP cells to
develop bone metastases. Radiographic analysis showed that
the development of osteolytic lesions was markedly suppressed in MDA/486STOP (Fig. 3B). Histologic examination
also showed that the metastatic tumor burden of MDA/
486STOP in bone was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with
MDA/EV (Fig. 3C). Osteoclast number was not different
between the groups (data not shown). Terminal deoxynucleo-

4242

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

tidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
staining revealed that apoptosis was increased in MDA/
486STOP (Fig. 3D and E), whereas cell mitosis was signiﬁcantly
decreased (Fig. 3F). In addition, IL-1b-induced metastases to
calvarial bones, as determined according to the same method
as Fig. 1A, were markedly reduced in MDA/486STOP (Fig. 3G).
These results suggest that IGF-IR activation by bone-derived
IGF facilitates the development of bone metastases by decreasing apoptosis and increasing proliferation of cancer cells
colonizing bone.
To determine whether these effects of IGF/IGF-IR are speciﬁc for bone metastases, tumor growth in the orthotopic
mammary fat pad, and the capacity to develop lung metastases
were examined. Tumor growth of MDA/486STOP in the orthotopic site was not different from that of MDA/EV (Fig. 3H).
Lung metastases were marginally reduced in MDA/486STOP
(Fig. 3I).
Because IGF-IR/486STOP is a secreted form of IGF-IR, the
possibility remains that it decreases bone metastasis via
inhibition of IGF-IR signaling not only in MDA-MB-231 cells
but also other neighboring bone-resident cells. To exclude this,
we established MDA-MB-231 clones in which IGF-IR was
stably knocked down (MDA/shIGF-IR) and tested their ability
to develop bone metastases. Consistent with the results of

showed metastases to calvarial bones (data not shown). Metastasis to lung was not different between MDA/IGF-IR and MDA/
EV (data not shown). Tumor growth at the mammary fat pad
did not signiﬁcantly differ between MDA/IGF-IR and MDA/EV
(Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results are in support of the
notion that IGF/IGF-IR axis plays a role selectively in bone
metastasis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
IGF-IR expression in bone metastases in cancer patients
To explore the clinical relevance of these ﬁndings obtained
in preclinical settings, we examined the expression of IGF-IR in
cancer cells in bone metastases in patients with several types of

A

cancers. Immunohistochemical study revealed that 13 of 15
cases (86.7%; Fig. 5A) showed strong expression of IGF-IR
(Fig. 5B) in cancer cells colonizing bone, suggesting an important role of IGF/IGF-IR axis in bone metastases in cancer
patients regardless of the primary site of tumors.
Role of Akt in bone metastases of MDA-MB-231 cells
Because Fig. 3D and E show that increased apoptosis in
MDA/486STOP is associated with reduced bone metastases,
we next studied the involvement of the serine/threonine kinase
Akt in the development of bone metastases. Akt is a downstream molecule of IGF-IR signaling and is widely recognized
as a cell survival or an antiapoptotic factor (12, 13, 21). Western

and p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; ref. 29), leading to
a complex formation of IRS-1 with p85 PI3K upstream of Akt
activation. Thus, the conventional IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling pathway is propagated in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.
Role of NF-kB in bone metastases of MDA-MB-231 cells
As another downstream molecule of IGF-IR signaling whose
activation is associated with survival of cancer cells, we examined the role of the transcription factor NF-kB in bone metastasis. EMSA analysis showed that IGF-I activated the p50 and
p65 subunit of NF-kB in MDA/EV (Fig. 7A, left and center).
MDA/IGF-IR exhibited increased NF-kB activation (Fig. 7A,
left). IGF-I failed to activate NF-kB in MDA/486STOP cells
(data not shown). NF-kB activation was also markedly suppressed in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing dominant-negative
IkBa (MDA/IkBaDN; Fig. 7A, right). Histologic and histomorphometric analysis revealed that MDA/IkBaDN developed
signiﬁcantly reduced bone metastases (Fig. 7B). Apoptosis in
MDA/IkBaDN cells in bone metastases was signiﬁcantly
increased compared with MDA/EV cells (Fig. 7C), whereas
mitosis in MDA/IkBaDN was signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 7C).
Osteoclast number at tumor–bone interface was decreased in
bone metastases of MDA/IkBaDN (Fig. 7C). Of note, however,
production of PTHrP, a potent stimulator of osteoclastogenesis, in MDA/IkBaDN cells in the absence or presence of TGF-b
was not changed compared with MDA/EV cells (Fig. 7D).

blot analysis showed that IGF-I induced phosphorylation at
threonine 308 (Fig. 6A, top left) and serine 473 (data not shown)
of Akt in MDA/EV. Phosphorylation at threonine 308 was
abolished in MDA/486STOP (Fig. 6A, top left) and increased
in MDA/IGF-IR (Fig. 6A, top right). These results show that
IGF-I/IGF-IR axis activated Akt. To examine the role of Akt
activation in bone metastasis, we established MDA-MB-231
cells expressing dominant-negative Akt (MDA/DN-Akt). Histologic and histomorphometric analysis showed that tumor
burden in bone was signiﬁcantly reduced in MDA/DN-Akt
compared with MDA/EV (Fig. 6B). The number of apoptosis in
MDA/DN-Akt cells in bone determined by TUNEL staining was
signiﬁcantly increased, although the number of mitotic cells
was not changed (Fig. 6C).
In separate experiments, we observed that IGF-I caused tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)

Bone is one of the most preferential target organs of cancer
metastasis (1–3). Although the precise mechanism by which
cancer cells preferentially spread to bone has not been fully
understood, it has been suggested that bone-derived growth
factors create favorable microenvironment for cancer cells to
survive and colonize bone. Consistent with this notion, our in
vivo study showed that stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption in calvarial bones by repeated injections of IL-1b before
cell inoculation markedly increased subsequent MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cell metastases to that local site. We previously
described that MDA-MB-231 cells rarely metastasize to calvarial bones following intracardiac inoculation in this model for
unknown reasons (7). In contrast, inhibition of bone resorption
by cotreatment with IL-1b and the BP ZOL, a potent inhibitor
of osteoclastic bone resorption, signiﬁcantly decreased MDAMB-231 metastases to calvarial bones. The CM harvested from
resorbed bones increased anchorage-independent growth of
MDA-MB-231 cells in soft agar compared with that of control
bone. On the other hand, the anchorage-independent growth
was not stimulated by the CM harvested from bones treated
with IL-1b together with ZOL. We previously described that
bone-stored growth factors are released from resorbed bone
into the culture medium in active forms (8). Taken together,
these results suggest that stimulation of bone resorption can
induce bone metastases at this rare site via promotion of breast
cancer cell colonization because of increased supply of bonestored growth factors. Our experiments prove that cancer
metastasis to bone is dependent on the extent of osteoclastic
bone resorption.

Next we studied which bone-stored growth factor is responsible for promotion of anchorage-independent growth of MDAMB-231 cells. To approach this, the effects of the neutralizing
antibodies to the growth factors that are known to be stored in
bone (6, 7) were examined in colony formation assay. Notably,
anchorage-independent growth-stimulatory effects of the
resorbed bone CM on MDA-MB-231 cells was blocked by the
neutralizing antibody to IGF-IR but not TGF-b, FGF, and
PDGF. Recombinant human IGF-I or IGF-II showed the greatest stimulation of anchorage-independent growth of the
growth factors tested. The CM harvested from resorbed bone
contained increased amounts of IGF-I compared with that
harvested from control bone and IGF-I concentration was
profoundly decreased in the CM harvested from bone in which
bone resorption was inhibited by ZOL. Moreover, our in vivo
studies showed that the number of mitosis was decreased in
MDA/486STOP cells in which IGF-IR signaling was disrupted
compared with that in MDA/EV. These results collectively
suggest that IGF-I is at least one of the growth factors responsible for promotion of cancer cell colonization in bone.
Earlier clinical studies have reported that aggressive breast
cancers express increased IGF-IR (14). However, it has not been

4246

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

examined whether human cancers spread to bone express
elevated IGF-IR. Our immunohistochemical study using clinical specimens obtained at surgery exhibited that cancer cells
colonizing bone were IGF-IR-positive regardless of the primary
site of tumors. Although it is unknown whether these cancers
also express IGF-IR at primary site, these observations suggest
that IGF-IR expression is a requisite for metastatic cancer cells
to appropriately respond to bone-derived IGFs to lead to bone
metastases. Indeed, disruption of IGF signaling by introducing
dominant-negative IGF-IR or short hairpin RNA against IGF-IR
in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells (MDA/486STOP or
MDA/shIGF-IR) signiﬁcantly reduced bone metastases. Similarly, an anti-IGF neutralizing monoclonal antibody decreases
tumor burden of MCF-7 human breast cancer in bone (30).
Conversely, overexpression of wild-type IGF-IR in MDA-MB231 cells (MDA/IGF-IR) signiﬁcantly increased bone metastases in this study. Furthermore, we previously reported that the
bone-seeking clone of MDA-MB-231 cells exhibits higher IGFIR expression and responsiveness to IGF-I than parental cells
(31). In contrast to these results, however, our in silico analysis
of the published microarray database GSE14244 and GSE16554

Bone-Derived IGF Promotes Breast Cancer Bone Metastases

(GEO; ref. 32) showed no differences in IGF-IR expression
between bone-metastatic and parental MDA-MB-231 cells
(data not shown). Thus, elevated expression of IGF-IR in cancer
cells may not always be a prerequisite for causing bone
metastasis. Nonetheless, our data suggest an important role
of IGF/IGF-IR axis in the development of bone metastasis in
breast cancer.
Although data are not shown here, we found that the CM of
resorbed bone not only stimulated anchorage-independent
growth but also PTHrP production in MDA-MB-231 cells. Of
note, this effect was blocked by the neutralizing antibody to
TGF-b but not IGF-IR. There were increased amounts of TGF-b
in the CM of resorbed bone as determined by the bioassay
using mink lung epithelial cells (33). Recombinant TGF-b1
(0.5–5 ng/mL) increased PTHrP production in MDA-MB-231
cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas IGF-I and IGF-II
had no effects. These results are consistent with those previously reported from our group (9, 34). PTHrP is a potent
stimulator of osteoclastic bone resorption and is one of the
primary cytokines that play a critical role in the pathophysiology of bone metastasis of breast cancer (1–3). We have also
reported that bone-derived TGF-b stimulates COX-2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells and a COX-2 inhibitor reduces bone
metastases (35). Moreover, it has recently been reported that
bone-derived TGF-b increases Jagged1 expression in metastatic breast cancer cells, which directly stimulates osteoclast
differentiation through activating Notch pathway (36). Taken
together, our results suggest that osteoclastic bone resorption
promotes bone metastasis at least in part through releasing
IGFs that stimulate cell proliferation and TGF-b that increases
PTHrP production and COX-2 and Jagged1 expression in breast
cancer cells metastasized in bone, which consequently leads to
the development and progression of bone metastases.
IGF has been also implicated in cell survival (12, 13). Our
results showed that apoptosis in MDA/486STOP cells in bone
was signiﬁcantly increased compared with MDA/EV, suggesting that activation of IGF-IR signaling by bone-derived IGFs
protected cancer cells from apoptosis. Akt is a well-described
survival factor that is activated by IGFs (12, 13, 21). We
conﬁrmed that IGF-I activated Akt in MDA-MB-231 cells and
found that this IGF-I–induced Akt activation was suppressed
or enhanced in MDA/486STOP or MDA/IGF-IR cells, respectively. More importantly, suppression of Akt signals by introduction of dominant-negative Akt in MDA-MB-231 cells
(MDA/DN-Akt) reduced bone metastases with increased numbers of apoptosis in cancer cells in bone. These results show
that Akt is a downstream molecule of IGF/IGF-IR signaling and
mediates antiapoptotic effects of IGFs on cancer cells in bone.
Thus, IGF-induced Akt activation takes a part in the promotion
of bone metastases.
NF-kB, another well-known survival factor (19), is one of the
downstream signaling molecules of IGF-IR/Akt pathway
(18, 20). Our in vitro studies showed that IGF-I activated
NF-kB in MDA-MB-231 cells and the IGF-I–induced NF-kB
activation was enhanced or suppressed in MDA/IGF-IR or
MDA/486STOP, respectively. Our in vivo study showed that
the dominant-negative inhibition of NF-kB by introducing
the truncated IkBa reduced bone metastases. Furthermore,

www.aacrjournals.org

apoptosis in MDA/IkBaDN cells in bone was signiﬁcantly
increased compared with MDA/EV. These results suggest that
the activation of NF-kB by IGF/IGF-IR axis also promotes bone
metastases through suppression of apoptosis in cancer cells.
Propagation of IGF-IR/Akt/NF-kB axis in breast cancer cells by
bone-derived IGFs facilitates bone metastasis and disruption
of this axis may be a promising approach to inhibit bone
metastasis of breast cancer.
Because NF-kB is a transcription factor, identiﬁcation of a
transcriptional target molecule is important to further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying bone metastasis of
breast cancer. We have previously shown that hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) promotes bone metastasis of MDAMB-231 cells partly via increased osteoclastogenesis and that
suppression of HIF-1a decreases bone metastases (37). It has
also been reported that NF-kB regulates HIF-1a gene expression at transcriptional levels (38) and that NF-kB–HIF-1 interaction contributes to an increase in breast cancer metastatic
capacity (39). Thus, HIF-1a could be one of the candidate
target molecules of NF-kB that can be implicated in bone
metastases.
NF-kB transcriptionally regulates the expression of a variety
of cytokines including IL-1b, IL-6, TNFs, and macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; ref. 19), all of which are
stimulators of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption (40).
Activation of NF-kB may augment cancer-induced bone
destruction through increased production of these osteoclastogenic cytokines. The result that osteoclast number was
decreased in bone metastases of MDA/IkBaDN cells supports
this notion. It should be noted that the production of PTHrP
was not changed in MDA/IkBaDN cells compared with MDA/
EV cells. It is therefore unlikely that the reduced number of
osteoclasts in bone metastases of MDA/IkBaDN cells is
because of decreased PTHrP production and that IGF-IR/
NF-kB pathway is involved in PTHrP-mediated osteoclastogenesis. In this context, Park and colleagues reported that
granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor is a target
of NF-kB, which mediates osteolytic bone metastasis of breast
cancer by stimulating osteoclast development (41). Contribution of NF-kB to osteoclast recruitment and bone resorption in
the pathophysiology of bone metastasis remains to be
elucidated.
IGFs are well-known mitogenic factors (12, 13). Our present
study showed that IGFs increased colony formation of MDAMB-231 cells. Furthermore, mitotic cells were decreased in
MDA/486STOP colonized bone. Similar results were also
observed in bone metastases of MDA/IkBaDN but not in
MDA/DN-Akt. These results suggest that IGF-IR signaling is
not necessarily acting through Akt to activate NF-kB.
Despite that MDA/486STOP showed reduced bone metastases, tumor development of MDA/486STOP at the orthotopic
mammary fat pad was not decreased compared with that of
MDA/EV. Furthermore, pulmonary metastasis of MDA/
486STOP or MDA/IGF-IR was changed to a marginal extent.
These results raise the possibility that IGF actions are relatively
bone-selective. Murphy and colleagues reported that the
expression of IGF-I and IGF-II in lung and mammary gland
is rarely detectable (42). Wu and colleagues have shown that

Hiraga et al.

hepatic metastasis of colon cancer is reduced in the liverspeciﬁc IGF-I–deﬁcient mice (43). From these earlier studies
together with our results, it is possible that organ/tissue IGF
concentration is inﬂuential on the behaviors of cancer cells
arresting at the local site. In this regard, metastatic breast
cancer cells with increased IGF-IR expression can take advantage of bone in which IGFs are abundantly stored. It is therefore
expected that blockade of IGF/IGF-IR axis using agents including neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and small molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (12, 13) may suppress cancer cells in
bone more effectively and selectively than other organs/
tissues.
In conclusion, our data suggest that bone-derived IGFs,
which are released from bone in substantial amounts by
osteoclastic bone resorption, activate IGF-IR, Akt, and NF-kB
signaling pathway, thereby increasing proliferation and
decreasing apoptosis in breast cancer cells that are colonizing
bone. These events consequently lead to the development and
progression of bone metastases. Given the abundance of IGFs
in bone, targeting IGF/IGF-IR/Akt/NF-kB signaling pathway
may be a selective and effective approach for the treatment of
bone metastases.
