Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in EGFR mutant
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is limited by the development of drug resistance mutations,
including the gatekeeper T790M mutation1-3. Strategies aimed at targeting EGFR T790M with
irreversible inhibitors have had limited success and are associated with toxicity due to concurrent
inhibition of wild type EGFR4,5. All current EGFR inhibitors possess a structurally related
quinazoline based core scaffold and were identified as ATP-competitive inhibitors of wild type
EGFR. Here we identify a covalent pyrimidine EGFR inhibitor by screening an irreversible kinase
inhibitor library specifically against EGFR T790M. These agents are 30-100 fold more potent against
EGFR T790M, and up to 100 fold less potent against wild type EGFR, than quinazoline based EGFR
inhibitors in vitro and are effective in murine models of lung cancer driven by EGFR T790M. Cocrystallization studies reveal a structural basis for the increased potency and mutant selectivity of
these agents. These mutant selective irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors may be clinically more

effective and better tolerated than quinazoline based inhibitors. Our findings demonstrate that
functional pharmacological screens against clinically important mutant kinases represent a powerful
strategy to identify new classes of mutant selective kinase inhibitors.

EGFR kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, are effective clinical therapies for NSCLCs
that harbor activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain1,6. The most common EGFR
mutations, L858R and delE746_A750, impart both an increased affinity for gefitinib or
erlotinib and a decreased affinity for ATP relative to wild type (WT) EGFR7,8. The clinical
efficacy of gefitinib/erlotinib is however ultimately limited by the development of acquired
drug resistance such as by mutation of the gatekeeper T790 residue (T790M) which is detected
in 50% of clinically resistant patients2,3. Unlike the analogous T315I mutation in ABL, which
introduces a steric impediment for imatinib binding, EGFR T790M only modestly effects
gefitinib binding but more importantly restores the affinity for ATP, similar to that of WT
EGFR9.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Most EGFR inhibitors are based on a 4-anilinoquinazoline core scaffold and were initially
identified as ATP-competitive inhibitors of WT EGFR. This includes irreversible inhibitors
that, unlike gefitinib, contain an electrophilic functionality which undergoes a Michael addition
reaction with a conserved cysteine residue present in EGFR (Cys797). The covalent nature of
these compounds allows them to achieve greater occupancy of the ATP-site relative to
reversible inhibitors providing the ability to inhibit EGFR T790M in pre-clinical models, in
spite of the increased ATP affinity conferred by this secondary mutation4,10,11. However, all
current irreversible inhibitors are less potent in cell line models harboring EGFR T790M
compared to those with an EGFR activating mutation alone (Figure S1) and at clinically
achievable concentrations, these agents do not inhibit EGFR T790M in vitro10-13. Since the
ATP affinity of EGFR T790M is similar to WT EGFR, the concentration of quinazoline-based
EGFR inhibitors required to inhibit EGFR T790M, will also effectively inhibit WT EGFR. In
patients, this concurrent inhibition of WT EGFR, results in skin rash and diarrhea, and limits
the ability to achieve plasma concentrations sufficient to inhibit EGFR T790M. As a
consequence the clinical efficacy of the irreversible EGFR inhibitors CI-1033, HKI-272 and
PF00299804 has been limited, especially in gefitinib/erlotinib resistant NSCLC patients, and
the dose limiting toxicity has been diarrhea and skin rash5,14,15.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that the anilinoquinazoline scaffold may not be the most potent or specific
for inhibiting EGFR T790M because it relies on the small size and hydrogen bonding
interactions with the gatekeeper threonine of WT EGFR. We prepared a focused library of
common kinase inhibitor core scaffolds where one of the side chains was modified with an
acrylamide group at a position that molecular modeling predicted to react with Cys 797. This
library was screened for compounds that could inhibit the growth of both gefitinib resistant
(PC9GR; delE746_A750/T790M) and sensitive (PC9; delE746_A750) cell lines but were not
toxic up to 10 μM against A549 (KRAS mutant) or H3122 (EML4-ALK) cells. We compared
our findings to both reversible (gefitinib) and irreversible EGFR inhibitors (CL-387,785 and
HKI-272). Three closely related pyrimidines, WZ3146, WZ4002, and WZ8040 were identified
from the screen that possessed up to a 300-fold lower IC50 against the PC9GR cells compared
to clinical stage inhibitors such as HKI-272 (Figures1A, 1B and Table S1). We observed a
similar increased potency of the WZ compounds in the H1975 (L858R/T790M) cell line and
in Ba/F3 cells harboring EGFR T790M (Figure 1B and Tables S1 and S2). The increased
cellular potency correlated with inhibition of EGFR, AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in

NSCLC cell lines (Figures 1C and S2) and with the more potent inhibition of EGFR
phosphorylation by WZ4002 in NIH-3T3 cells expressing different EGFR T790M mutant
alleles (Figures 1D and S3). The profile against ERBB2 was markedly different; the WZ
compounds were less potent than CL-387,785 or HKI-272 (Tables S1 and S2) and did not
inhibit ERBB2 phosphorylation in 3T3 cells expressing the ERBB2 gatekeeper (T798I)
mutation (data not shown). Analysis of recombinant EGFR T790M kinase incubated with
WZ3146 by electrospray mass spectrometry revealed stoichiometric addition of one inhibitor
molecule to the protein. Analysis of a pepsin digest of the modified protein by tandem MS
identified Cys 797 as the site of modification thus verifying covalent bond formation between
WZ3146 and EGFR (Figure S4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We profiled WZ3146 and WZ4002 against a panel of 400 kinases using the Ambit kinome
screening platform (Table S3 and Figure S5). For WZ4002, kinases that exhibited greater than
95% inhibition relative to the DMSO control (Ambit score < 5) at 10 μM were selected for
measurement of their dissociation constants (Table S3). In addition to EGFR, we observed
potent inhibition of several of the ten kinases that possess a cysteine at the same position as
EGFR including a subset of the TEC-family kinases (Figure S6). Cross-reactivity with BMX
has been reported for irreversible quinazoline-derived EGFR inhibitors16. To confirm whether
the observed binding activity translated into cellular inhibition, WZ4002 and WZ3146 were
profiled against Ba/F3 cells transformed with TEL fusions of BMX, BLK, JAK2 and JAK3.
WZ4002, which possesses an ortho-methoxy group at the C2-aniline substituent, is more
selective for EGFR compared to WZ3146 (Table S4).
We next determined whether the increased potency of the WZ compounds against mutant
EGFR also applied to WT EGFR. We used EGFR WT HN11 cells17 and Ba/F3 cells harboring
the EGFR vIII mutation which contains a WT kinase domain (Figure 2A and Table S2). These
compounds were 3-100-fold less potent, with WZ4002 being least potent, compared to
CL-387,785 and HKI-272 at inhibiting the growth of the EGFR WT cells. Furthermore,
WZ4002 was 100-fold less effective at inhibiting phosphorylation of WT EGFR compared to
the quinazoline inhibitors (Figure 2B). Similarly, WZ4002 inhibited EGFR kinase activity of
recombinant L858R/T790M protein more potently than of WT EGFR, while the opposite was
observed with HKI-272 and gefitinib (Figures S7A and S7B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to better understand the potency and relative selectivity for EGFR T790M over WT
EGFR, we determined the crystal structure of WZ4002 in complex with EGFR T790M (Figures
3A, 3B and S8 and Table S5). The compound binds within the ATP-binding cleft of the enzyme,
forming the expected covalent bond with Cys797. As expected based upon co-structures of
related pyrimidine derived inhibitors with CDK218, JNK119, and FAK20, the anilinopyrimidine
core of WZ4002 forms a bidentate hydrogen bonding interaction with the ‘hinge’ residue Met
793 (Figure 3B). The chlorine substituent on the pyrimidine ring contacts the mutant gatekeeper
residue, Met790. The hydrophobicity conferred by this mutation likely contributes to the
potency of these compounds against the T790M mutant. The aniline ring forms a hydrophobic
interaction with the α-carbon of Gly796 and its methoxy substituent extends toward Leu792
and Pro794 in the hinge region. The greater selectivity of the WZ4002 compound likely derives
from the fact that both JAK3 and TEC-family kinases have a bulkier residue (tyrosine in JAK3,
phenylalanine in TEC-family) in the position of Leu792, which would be expected to sterically
interfere with the methoxy group in WZ4002. The reactive acrylamide moeity and the linking
phenyl ring comprise the other arm of the inhibitor. The “linker” phenyl ring lies roughly
perpendicular to the pyrimidine core; this orientation juxtaposes the acrylamide with the thiol
of Cys797 for covalent bond formation (Figure 3B).
We further determined whether WZ4002 is effective in vivo using mouse lung cancer models
harboring either EGFR L858R/T790M or Del E746_A750/T790M. We chose WZ4002 for the

in vivo studies because in vitro it was least potent against WT EGFR and against other cysteine
containing kinases (Tables S2 and S4) but was effective against EGFR T790M. A
pharmacokinetic study was performed to determine the achievable plasma concentration
(429ng/ml), half life (2.5 hours), and the oral bioavailability (24%) of WZ4002 (Tables S6, S7
and S8). In a pharmacodynamic study WZ4002 effectively inhibited EGFR, AKT and ERK1/2
phosphorylation (Figure 4A) which was associated with a significant increase in TUNEL
positive and a significant decrease in Ki67 positive cells compared to vehicle alone treated
mice (Figures 4B and 4C). To evaluate whether WZ4002 imparted a differential effect on WT
EGFR in vivo, we evaluated EGFR phosphorylation in the hair bulb from mouse skin following
treatment with either erlotinib or WZ4002 (Figures 2C and 2D). Only erlotinib significantly
inhibited EGFR phosphorylation in the hair bulb. In a 2 week efficacy study, WZ4002 treatment
resulted in significant tumor regressions compared to vehicle alone in both T790M containing
murine models (Figures 4D, 4E and S9). Histological evaluation of the lungs following
treatment confirmed significant resolution of the tumor nodules with only few small residual
nodules and nodule remnants that had evidence of treatment effect with decreased cellularity
and increased fibrosis consistent with remodeling/scarring (Figure 4F). There were no signs
of overt toxicity compared with vehicle treated mice during the study as assessed by changes
in weight (data not shown), serum creatine and total white blood cell count (Figure S10).

Our studies identify a novel structural class of EGFR kinase inhibitors which are effective in
vitro and in vivo models harboring the EGFR T790M mutation. Given the dramatic activity in
models with established EGFR T790M, we determined whether WZ4002 treatment could also
prevent the development of EGFR T790M using in vitro models harboring EGFR activating
mutations. Unlike with gefitinib or HKI-272, which when used at their achievable plasma
concentrations lead to development of EGFR T790M in vitro13,21,22, we were unable to isolate
any EGFR T790M containing clones from WZ4002 treated Ba/F3 or PC9 NSCLC cells (Table
S9). These findings suggest that WZ4002 could also be used as initial therapy for EGFR mutant
NSCLC patients and may ultimately lead to a longer time to disease progression than currently
achieved with gefitinib1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our crystallographic studies provide insight as to why WZ4002 is so much more effective
against L858R/T790M than HKI-272. Although both share the irreversible component, the
anilinopyrimidine scaffold of WZ4002 is an intrinsically better fit for the mutant gatekeeper
methionine (Figure S11). To further test this hypothesis we prepared WZ4003, a reversible
analog of WZ4002 which is non-reactive toward Cys797. WZ4003 binds to the L858R/T790M
mutant 100-fold more tightly than it does to the WT EGFR (Table S10), confirming that the
scaffold per se is indeed specific for the mutant kinase. Importantly, the WZ compounds rely
on covalent bond formation for potent cellular inhibition, as evidenced by the 100-fold increase
in IC50 of WZ4002 against the EGFR C797S mutants and by the significantly reduced cellular
IC50 of WZ4003 against T790M containing Ba/F3 cells (Table S2). These observations
highlight the importance of using a library of irreversible kinase inhibitors, as WZ4003 would
not have been identified in the initial cellular screen.
Mutations, including at the gatekeeper residue, are a common mechanism of drug resistance
to kinase inhibitors. The current approach, using a cellular screen expressing the mutant kinase
of interest, can be applied to identify novel agents specifically against drug resistance or
oncogenic mutations implicated in human cancers. Such agents may truly be cancer selective
and clinically more potent and less toxic than those that also concurrently inhibit the wild type
kinase. The agents described here are unique in that they inhibit both the drug sensitizing and
resistance mutations but are selective against WT EGFR23,24,25. Further studies are needed to
determine whether this class of EGFR inhibitors will be clinically effective in patients with
EGFR mutant cancers harboring EGFR T790M mediated acquired drug resistance.

Figure 3. Crystal Structure of WZ4002 bound to EGFR T790M

A. Chemical structures of WZ8040 and WZ4002 are shown schematically in a manner
resembling the conformation adopted in complex with the kinase. B. Crystal structure of
WZ4002 in complex with EGFR T790M mutant (PDB ID 3IKA). WZ4002 binds the active
conformation of the kinase, with the both the regulatory C-helix and “DFG” segment of the
activation loop in their inward, active positions. The EGFR kinase is shown in a ribbon
representation (blue) with the bound inhibitor in yellow. Sidechain and mainchain atoms are
shown for selected residues that contact the compound. Expected hydrogen bonds to the
backbone amide and carbonyl atoms of Met 793 are indicated by dashed lines. Note also the
covalent bond with Cys797. The structure was refined to a crystallographic R value of 21.3%

murine models of EGFR T790M

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A. Two doses separated by 16 hours of WZ4002 (2.5 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg) or vehicle were
administered to EGFR delE746_A750/T790M or L858R/T790M mice with MRI confirmed
tumors. The mice were sacrificed, the lungs isolated and grossly dissected and subjected to cell
lysis. Cell extracts were immunoblotted to detect the indicated proteins. B.
Immunohistochemical analyses of tumors from EGFR delE746_A750/T790M mice from A.
using indicated antibodies. Scale bar, 50 μm. C. Quantification of TUNEL and Ki67 positive
cells from tumor nodules (n=4) from vehicle and WZ4002 treated mice. The mean and standard
deviation are plotted. D. MRI images of vehicle or WZ4002 treated mice at baseline (0w) and
following 2 weeks (2w) of treatment. E. Quantification of the relative tumor volume from MRI
images from vehicle treated mice (E746_A750/T790M (n=3); L858R/T790M (n = 4)), and
WZ4002 treated L858R/T790M (n=3) and E746_A750/T790M (n=3) mice. The mean and
standard deviation are plotted. F. Tumors from vehicle and WZ4002 treated mice stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. Low power view (inset) demonstrates near complete resolution of
tumors in the WZ4002 treated mice. Scale bar, 100 μm.
