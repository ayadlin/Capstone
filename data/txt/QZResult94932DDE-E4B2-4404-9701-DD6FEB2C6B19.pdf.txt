Abstract
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway deregulation is
a common event in human cancer, either through inactivation
of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue
deleted from chromosome 10 or activating mutations of p110A. These hotspot mutations result in oncogenic activity of the
enzyme and contribute to therapeutic resistance to the antiHER2 antibody trastuzumab. The PI3K pathway is, therefore,
an attractive target for cancer therapy. We have studied NVPBEZ235, a dual inhibitor of the PI3K and the downstream
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). NVP-BEZ235
inhibited the activation of the downstream effectors Akt, S6
ribosomal protein, and 4EBP1 in breast cancer cells. The
antiproliferative activity of NVP-BEZ235 was superior to the
allosteric selective mTOR complex inhibitor everolimus in a
panel of 21 cancer cell lines of different origin and mutation
status. The described Akt activation due to mTOR inhibition
was prevented by higher doses of NVP-BEZ235. NVP-BEZ235
reversed the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway
caused by the oncogenic mutations of p110-A, E545K, and
H1047R, and inhibited the proliferation of HER2-amplified
BT474 cells exogenously expressing these mutations that
render them resistant to trastuzumab. In trastuzumabresistant BT474 H1047R breast cancer xenografts, NVPBEZ235 inhibited PI3K signaling and had potent antitumor
activity. In treated animals, there was complete inhibition of
PI3K signaling in the skin at pharmacologically active doses,
suggesting that skin may serve as surrogate tissue for
pharmacodynamic studies. In summary, NVP-BEZ235 inhibits
the PI3K/mTOR axis and results in antiproliferative and
antitumoral activity in cancer cells with both wild-type and
mutated p110-A. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):8022–30]

Introduction
The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway
plays a central role in diverse cellular functions, including
proliferation, growth, survival, and metabolism. In addition to
their physiologic role, several isoforms of the PI3K family are

implicated in pathologic processes and diseases. In particular,
members of class 1A PI3Ks, which are heterodimers comprised of a
p85 regulatory and a p110 catalytic subunit, are often mutated in
human cancer (1–6).
The initiating event of a growth factor binding to a receptor
tyrosine kinase enables PI3K to interact with the intracellular
domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase (7, 8). This binding, which
occurs either directly or indirectly via adaptor molecules such as
insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), removes the inhibitory effect of
p85 and leads to the activation of the lipid kinase activity of the
p110 subunit (9). The GTPase RAS can also directly activate PI3K
(10). p110 phosphorylates the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate
to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, itself responsible for
facilitating the phosphorylation of Akt (also known as PKB) at
Thr308 by PDK1 (11). A second phosphorylation event at Ser473 by
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-rictor complex
(mTORC2) is required for maximal Akt activity (8, 12).
Akt is the central effector of the pathway (reviewed in Engelman
and colleagues 13). It is able to execute its myriad cellular
operations via a host of effectors, including direct substrates such
as tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3),
and the forkhead box transcription factors (FOXO). It promotes
protein synthesis and cell growth by alleviating TSC1/2 suppression of mTOR, allowing the latter to act as part of the mTOR-raptor
complex on 4EBP1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K; ref. 14).
Akt reduces cell cycle inhibitors p27 and p21, and promotes cell
cycle proteins c-Myc and cyclin D1, resulting in enhanced cellular
proliferation. Influence extends to a host of proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic proteins, such as the Bcl-2 family member Bad,
limiting programmed cell death and boosting cellular survival.
Some of these phenomena are mediated by the Akt-driven
expulsion of FOXO from the nucleus, from which it normally
inhibits the transcription of genes promoting apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest.
Genetic aberrations of the PI3K/Akt pathway are among the
most commonly encountered in human cancer. Germ line loss of
function mutations at the PTEN gene locus on chromosome 10q
result in cancer predisposition syndromes, whereas somatic loss of
heterozygosity 10q is prevalent in breast, gastric, endometrial and
prostate cancer, and glioblastomas (13, 15). PIK3CA, the gene
encoding p110-a, is frequently amplified or mutated. The
mutations tend to cluster in ‘‘hotspots’’, with f80% accounted
for by oncogenic substitutions in exon 9 (E542K and E545K) and
exon 20 (H1047R; ref. 1). Breast, colon, endometrial, and
hepatocellular cancers harbor these changes with greatest
frequency in human populations (16). These critical perturbations
have shown transforming capacity in vitro and in vivo (17, 18).

NVP-BEZ235 Prevents Oncogenic PI3K Signaling

Excessive signaling through the PI3K/Akt cascade has been
shown to be both prognostic and predictive. In breast cancer,
PIK3CA mutation and functional PTEN loss have been linked with
poorer patient outcomes, whereas in glioblastoma, high pathway
activity has been shown to be significantly associated with reduced
patient survival times (19, 20). Constitutive PI3K activity predicting
for resistance to cytotoxic agents has been shown in models of
breast, lung, and ovarian cancer, often evidenced by attenuation in
the level of apoptosis (21–23). Furthermore, the anti-HER2
monoclonal antibody trastuzumab depends on intact p110-a or
PTEN for its action in HER2-overexpressing breast cell lines (19, 24).
This constellation of features of PI3K/Akt signaling—critical
cellular functions, prevalent oncogenic genetic aberrations, consequent therapeutic resistance, and its potential reversal—have made
the inhibition of this pathway an attractive target for developmental anticancer strategies. A new generation of PI3K inhibitors is
emerging, overcoming earlier problems of poor selectivity,
unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles, and unacceptable toxicity
(reviewed in ref. 25). A number of these agents have entered early
phase clinical trials. NVP-BEZ235 (Novartis Pharma) is a synthetic
low molecular mass compound belonging to the class of imidazoquinolines that potently and reversibly inhibits class 1 PI3K
catalytic activity by competing at its ATP-binding site. NVPBEZ235 also inhibits mTOR catalytic activity but does not target
other protein kinases (26).
In this report, we show that NVP-BEZ235 is highly active against
breast cancer cell lines and xenografts harboring endogenous or
overexpressed p110-a mutants. Under the tested experimental
conditions, we establish a differential effect of NVP-BEZ235
according to the concentration used, whereby mTOR inhibition
predominates at a low concentration (<100 nmol/L) but dual
mTOR/PI3K blockade is observed at relatively higher concentrations (500 nmol/L).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and treatments. All the cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and maintained in 1:1 DMEM/F12
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Life Technologies, Inc. Ltd.) at 37jC in 5% CO2. Cells infected with the PI3Kbased vectors were selected and maintained in the same medium containing
1.0 and 0.5 Ag/mL of puromycin (Sigma), respectively. NVP-BEZ235,
everolimus (NVP-RAD001), and NVP-AEW541 were kindly provided by
Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research-Oncology, Basel Switzerland and
were dissolved in DMSO. Trastuzumab (Herceptin; kindly provided by
F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was dissolved in sterile
apyrogenic water. Cells were treated at the indicated final concentrations
of drugs. Wherever indicated, cells were serum-deprived for 16 h, then
incubated with the appropriate inhibitor, and finally stimulated with insulin
growth factor I (IGF-I; 50 ng/mL) for 30 min. DMSO was added to the culture
medium of the control cells and was always kept below 0.1%.
Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. For
drug treatments, cells were counted and their viability assessed with a
Guava cytometer. Cells (2  105 to 4  105) were grown in 60 mm dishes
and treated with NVP-BEZ235 for the indicated concentrations and
time. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into
ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (20 mmol/L
Na2PO4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mmol/L
h-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 50 mmol/L NaF supplemented with
200 Amol/L Na2VO4, and protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche). For detection
of caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage products, the
detached cells were collected and lysed together with the adherent cells.
Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000  g for 10 min at 4jC, and

supernatants were then removed and assayed for protein concentration
using the DC Protein assay (Bio-Rad). Thirty micrograms of total lysates
were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to
nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride ( for Thr308-P-Akt, 4EBP1 and
cleaved caspase 3 detection) membranes. Membranes were hybridized with
the following primary antibodies from Cell Signaling: Ser473-P-Akt, Thr308P-Akt, Akt, Ser240/244-P-S6, S6, 4EBP1, PARP, IRS-1, and cleaved caspase 3
in 5% bovine serum albumin or with caspase 3 (Alexis Biochemicals) and
actin (Bionova) in 1% nonfat dry milk. Mouse and rabbit horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were
used at 1:3,000 in PBS-T/1% nonfat dry milk. Protein-antibody complexes
were detected by chemiluminescence with the SuperSignal West Dura
Extended Duration Substrate, and images were captured with a FUJIFILM
LAS-3000 camera system. The experiments were repeated at least thrice.
For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were grown in 100 mm
dishes and treated with NVP-BEZ235, everolimus, NVP-AEW541, or the
combination of drugs for 24 to 48 h. Volumes of 500 AL of lysis buffer
containing equal amount of proteins were incubated with immobilized Akt1
antibody (Cell Signaling) overnight at 4jC with gentle rotation. The beads
were washed thrice with lysis buffer before suspension in SDS loading
buffer. For immunofluorescence, 4  104 cells were seeded on 14-mm
coverslips in 24-well plates. After treatment was completed, cells were
washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 20 min at room
temperature and permeabilized in cold PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for
10 min at room temperature. After blocking with PBS, 1% bovine serum
albumin, 0.1% saponin, and 0.02% azide for 40 min at room temperature, the
slides were incubated with the primary antibody (1:50, FOXO; Santa Cruz)
for 1 h at room temperature and thereafter with the anti-rabbit Alexa 488
antibody (1:500). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole–containing Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and visualized by confocal microscopy. The negative
control shows a staining without primary antibody.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells (5  105) were seeded in 60-mm dishes and
treated with NVP-BEZ235 for 48 h. Floating and adherent cells were
collected by trypsinization and washed once with PBS. Cells were incubated
in 70% ethanol at 20jC overnight, treated with 20 Ag/mL RNase A, then
stained with 0.5 Ag/mL of propidium iodide, and evaluated by flow
cytometry (Beckman Coulter Epics XL, Beckman Coulter). The experiments
were repeated thrice.
Proliferation assays: crystal violet and WST-1. Depending on the cell
line, 2  103 to 4  105 cells were seeded in six-well plates and treated with
increasing doses of NVP-BEZ235. Medium was replaced every 3 to 4 days.
After 11 days, adherent cells were fixed in 20% glutaraldehyde in growth
medium for 10 min, then washed twice in distilled water and stained with
0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. After washing, the stain was dissolved with
10% acetic acid and subsequently quantified at 570 nm. The 50% growthinhibitory concentrations were calculated for at least two independent
assays per cell line. For BT474 cells overexpressing the ecotropic receptor
(BT474-eco), 4  104 cells were seeded in 12-well plates. Medium was
replaced every 3 to 4 days with the indicated drugs. After 8 days, cell
proliferation was quantified by crystal violet as described.
For WST-1–based cell viability assays, 1  105 cells were seeded in 96well plates and were treated with increasing doses of NVP-BEZ235 and
everolimus for 72 h, starting 24 h after seeding (day 1). The WST-1
colorimetric assay was quantified at 415 nm, and normalized to the value of
untreated cells. A duplicate plate of untreated cells was measured at 24 h.
The X-axis value represents the amount of cells at the beginning of the
assay and resulted from the ratio between untreated cells at 24 h and
untreated cells at 72 h. All experiments were repeated at least twice.
Overexpression of PIK3CA mutants. pBABE-based and pJp-1520–based
vectors were kindly provided by Marion Dorsch (Novartis Oncology,
Cambridge, MA) and Joan Brugge (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA),
respectively. Plasmid DNA was sequenced to confirm the presence of the
oncogenic mutations. SkBr3 and BT474 cells overexpressing the ecotropic
receptor (SkBr3-eco and BT474-eco, respectively) were infected with
ecotropically packed retroviruses, whereas amphotropic viruses were
needed to infect MDA-231 and BT474-VH2 cells.

Tumor xenografts in nude mice. Mice were maintained and treated in
accordance with institutional guidelines of Vall d’Hebron University
Hospital Care and Use Committee. Six- to 8-week-old female athymic
nude-Foxn1nu mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Italy). Mice
were housed in air-filtered laminar flow cabinets with a 12-h light cycle and
food and water ad libitum. Mice were handled with aseptic procedures and
allowed to acclimatize to local conditions for 1 week before the
experimental manipulations. A 17h-estradiol pellet (Innovative Research
of America) was implanted s.c. into each mouse 1 day before injection of
BT474-VH2 cells. BT474-VH2 cells were obtained from in vitro explants of
BT474-derived xenografts (27) and expanded in DMEM/F12 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 Ag/mL puromycin (Sigma), and 2 mmol/L
of L-glutamine at 37jC in 5% CO2. Cells (2  107) were resuspended in PBS,
mixed with Matrigel (1:1; BD Biosciences) and injected s.c. into the right
flank of each mouse in 200 AL of final volume. Treatment began when
tumors reached an average size of 500 mm3 (11 days after injection)

and were thus considered as established growing xenografts. NVP-BEZ235
(40 mg/kg in 10% NMP–90% PEG) was freshly prepared and given p.o. once
every 24 h in 100 AL of volume. Tumor xenografts were measured with
calipers thrice a week, and tumor volume was determined using the
formula: (length  width2)  (k/6). At the end of the experiment, the
animals were anesthetized with a 1.5% isofluorane-air mixture and killed by
cervical dislocation. Results are presented as mean F SD.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumor xenografts and non–tumor tissue
(skin) were fixed immediately after removal in a 10% buffered formalin
solution for a maximum of 48 h at room temperature before being
dehydrated and paraffin-embedded under vacuum conditions. Slides were
deparaffinized, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by
incubation in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min at room temperature.
Sections were then microwaved in PBS for 4 min for antigen retrieval and
incubated with avidin and then biotin for 15 min each to block nonspecific
binding. An immunoperoxidase technique was then performed using a

with NVP-BEZ235 at concentrations 100 and 500 nmol/L for up to 48 h. Phosphorylation of Akt initially decreased but slowly recovered after 24 h to 48 h, whereas
S6 remained dephosphorylated, as did 4EBP1. At 500 nmol/L, NVP-BEZ235 inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was sustained. D, Western blot of total lysates
showing increase in Akt phosphorylation in DU145 cells treated with NVP-BEZ235 at 10 and 100 nmol/L and everolimus at 5 nmol/L for 48 h. AEW-541 (1 Amol/L)
prevented both NVP-BEZ235-dependent and everolimus-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Akt. NVP-BEZ235 (500 nmol/L) fully decreased P-Akt. As a
control, 90 min of treatment with the dual inhibitor fully decreased P-Akt, P-S6, and P-4EBP1. Everolimus (5 nmol/L) did not fully dephosphorylate 4EBP1. NVP-BEZ235
induced IRS-1 dephosphorylation (lower mobility shift) and accumulation, similar to everolimus.

antibodies were Ser473-P-Akt, Ser240/244-P-S6, Thr70-P-4EBP1, and Ki67
(all from Cell Signaling) and secondary antibody was from Amersham. As a
negative control, primary antibody was omitted. No labeling was ever
observed in control experiments when primary antibodies were omitted or,
alternatively, when normal nonimmune serum was used. There was no
evidence of cross-reactivity with the antibodies used in this study. H-scores
were used to quantify the expression of the phosphoproteins, whereas the
percentage of stained cells was counted in the Ki67 staining.
Statistical analysis. Inhibitory concentrations 50 (IC50) and growthinhibitory concentrations 50 (GI50) were estimated graphically as the

For in vitro assays and nude mice experiments, comparisons between
groups were made using a two-tailed Student’s t test. Differences of P < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.

Results
NVP-BEZ235 inhibits Akt, S6RP (S6), and 4EBP1 phosphorylation and induces FKHRL1 nuclear translocation. The dual
p110 and mTORC1/2 inhibitory activity of NVP-BEZ235 was
assessed in breast cancer cell lines with different modulations of
the PI3K/Akt cascade as a result of wild-type p110-a (MDA-231),
mutated p110-a (MCF7, T47D), loss of PTEN (MDA-468), or
amplification of HER2 (BT474, SkBr3). Dose-response experiments

www.aacrjournals.org

showed that NVP-BEZ235 was able to inhibit the phosphorylation
of Ser473-Akt, Ser240/244-S6, and 4EBP1 in all cell lines tested,
irrespective of the basal activation of PI3K/Akt cascade (Fig. 1A).
Similar findings were observed in a panel of non–breast cancer cell
lines (data not shown). Together with Ser473-P-Akt, phosphorylation of Thr308-Akt was also reduced in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Of note, the IC50 for Ser473-P-Akt was
6.4-fold higher than that of P-S6 (77 F 29 nmol/L compared with
12 F 10 nmol/L). In agreement with an elevated IC50 for Ser473P-Akt, we observed that complete FKHRL1 nuclear translocation
was achieved only at 500 nmol/L NVP-BEZ235 and not at the lower
dose of 100 nmol/L (Fig. 1B).4 Indeed, mTORC2 is the necessary
component of the Ser473-P-Akt-FOXO pathway (28).
Moreover, time course experiments revealed that long-term
exposure to low concentrations of NVP-BEZ235 resulted in
sustained inhibition of P-S6, with a concomitant increase of PAkt levels. Such an effect on P-Akt was completely abolished in
cells incubated at higher concentrations of the inhibitor (Fig. 1C).
In agreement with previously published data (29, 30), we found that
the total levels of S6 decreased after long-term exposure to NVPBEZ235.

Suboptimal doses of NVP-BEZ235 induce Akt phosphorylation. We investigated whether the long-term increase in P-Akt
levels observed in cells exposed to a low concentration of NVPBEZ235 was due to the disruption of the known S6K1 to IRS-1
negative feedback loop (31). For this purpose, we chose the DU145
prostate cancer cells, for which the rapamycin-induced deregulation of S6K–IRS-1 is well described (32). When DU145 cells were
treated with NVP-BEZ235 for a short period of time (90 minutes)
Akt was completely dephosphorylated regardless of the dose level
used (Fig. 1D). On the contrary, as previously observed in Fig. 1C,
longer term (48 hours) exposure to low doses of NVP-BEZ235
(10 and 100 nmol/L) induced an increase in P-Akt. This effect was
prevented by the IGF-IR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AEW-541. Also, a
higher NVP-BEZ235 concentration (500 nmol/L) completely
blocked Akt phosphorylation in these cells, irrespective of
treatment duration. As expected, the rapamycin analogue everolimus, an mTORC1 inhibitor (which seems to have additional
activity against the mTORC2 in some cells; ref. 33) led to the
inactivation of mTOR targets and was associated with increased
levels of P-Akt both at 90 minutes and 48 hours. This effect was
abolished by NVP-AEW541 (48 hours). Both inhibitors, NVPBEZ235 and everolimus, induced IRS-1 dephosphorylation (lower
mobility shift) and accumulation, as described for everolimus (32).
Although a similar effect was observed in the breast cancer cell
lines BT474 and MDA-468, this was not reverted with the help of
IGF-IR (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Reduction of cellular proliferation in cancer cells is
associated with G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis. Cellular
viability and proliferation was assessed by both WST-1 assay and
crystal violet staining in an extended panel of cancer cells of
different origin with diverse activation status in the PI3K and Ras
pathways (n = 21). NVP-BEZ235 reduced the number of viable cells
in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines tested after 3 days
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S3). When compared with everolimus,
the dual inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 was consistently more potent in
inhibiting the proliferation of the tested cells at concentrations
>10 nmol/L. Similar results were obtained by treating the cancer

control or p110-a–overexpressing cells. The increased Akt phosphorylation was
inhibited by 100 nmol/L of NVP-BEZ235 treatment for 6 h.

cells for an extended period of time and calculating the GI50s. All
cells tested were potently inhibited by NVP-BEZ235, with GI50s
ranging between 5 and 32 nmol/L. A trend was observed, in that KRas/B-Raf/EGFR+ cell lines were less sensitive to NVP-BEZ235
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Consistent with the antiproliferative effects of NVP-BEZ235,
the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle was
substantially increased after treatment with the inhibitor (Fig. 2B).
Markers of apoptosis such as cleavage products of caspase 3 and
PARP were detected by Western blot in four representative breast
cancer cell lines with different PI3K pathways and HER2 status
(Fig. 2C).
NVP-BEZ235 targets p110-A oncogenic mutations. In order
to confirm the ability of NVP-BEZ235 to target the p110-a
oncogenic mutations in cell culture, we exogenously expressed
wild-type p110-a and the E545K and H1047R mutations in a cell
line with a wild-type p110-a background and low levels of basal
P-Akt (MDA-231 cells). In conditions of serum deprivation, the
oncogenic mutations induced constitutive Akt phosphorylation,
which was abolished when the cells were treated with NVP-BEZ235
for 6 hours (Fig. 3), demonstrating that NVP-BEZ235 targets p110-a
oncogenic mutations.
NVP-BEZ235 overcomes trastuzumab-resistance driven by
p110-A oncogenic mutations in HER2-positive breast cancer
cells. We engineered both BT474 and SkBr3 breast cancer cells
(HER2-amplified and trastuzumab-sensitive) to overexpress the
p110-a–activating mutations E545K or H1047R, which have
recently been shown to confer resistance to trastuzumab (19).
As expected, overexpression of mutated p110-a E545K and
H1047R in BT474 cells increased P-Akt when compared with
control cells (Fig. 4A). Down-regulation of HER2 with trastuzumab
reduced the levels of Akt in control cells but not in wild-type or
mutated p110-a–overexpressing cells. Similarly, 4EBP1 was
dephosphorylated only in control cells treated with trastuzumab.
NVP-BEZ235 was active in decreasing Akt, S6, and 4EBP1
phosphorylation in all cells regardless of their p110-a status. A
WST-1 assay was used to assess the growth-inhibitory potential of
both trastuzumab and NVP-BEZ235 at increasing doses. BT474
cells bearing p110-a oncogenic mutations were less sensitive to
trastuzumab compared with the p110-a wild-type and control
cells (Fig. 4B). The capacity of NVP-BEZ235 to inhibit the proliferation of p110-a–mutated cells was also quantified by crystal
violet staining after 8 days of continuous drug exposure. Hotspot
mutated cells grew faster than control cells in the presence of
trastuzumab, whereas all cells showed equal growth inhibition in
the presence of NVP-BEZ235 (Fig. 4C). The same effects as in
Fig. 4A, B and C were observed in SkBr3 cells overexpressing the
PI3K mutants (data not shown).
NVP-BEZ235 antitumor activity in vivo. The antitumor
activity of NVP-BEZ235 was further studied in a xenograft model
derived from HER2-amplified BT474 breast cancer cells engineered
to express either the H1047R hotspot mutation or the empty vector
(pBABE). NVP-BEZ235 daily oral treatment at 40 mg/kg started
11 days after cell injection, when tumors reached an average volume
of 500 mm3. NVP-BEZ235 resulted in suppressed tumor growth
(Fig. 5A). The H1047R-overexpressing tumors responded better to
the NVP-BEZ235 treatment when compared with mock controls.
At the end of the experiment, we measured the levels of P-Akt, P-S6,
P-4EBP1, and Ki67 in tumor tissues by Western blot and

post-drug administration. In both H1047R and control tumors,

NVP-BEZ235 Prevents Oncogenic PI3K Signaling

Figure 4. PI3K mutants in HER2+ cells are sensitive to NVP-BEZ235 in vitro. A, overexpression of E545K and H1047R mutations induced Akt phosphorylation in
untreated cells (O ). Trastuzumab (T, 50 nmol/L, 48 h) decreased HER2 expression in all cells treated but only achieved Akt and 4EBP1 dephosphorylation in
control cells. NVP-BEZ235 (B, 500 nmol/L, 24 h) achieved dephosphorylation of all of the depicted PI3K targets in all cells. B, the sensitivity of BT474 cells
overexpressing either p110-a wild-type or the activating mutations E545K and H1047R was assayed by WST-1 after 72 h of NVP-BEZ235 and trastuzumab treatment
at increasing concentrations. Oncogenic mutations conferred resistance to trastuzumab but were equally sensitive to NVP-BEZ235 compared with p110-a
overexpressing or control cells. *, P < 0.05, compared with empty vector control. C, the growth of BT474 cells overexpressing either wild-type p110-a or hotspot
mutations was assessed by crystal violet after 8 days of treatment. Mutated cells were less sensitive to trastuzumab (T, 15 nmol/L) compared with p110-a–
overexpressing cells or mock control, whereas they were inhibited by NVP-BEZ235 (B, 10 nmol/L). **, P < 0.01 ***, P < 0.001, compared with mock control.

P-Akt was reduced at 1 hour post-dosing, but recovered to baseline
24 hours after drug administration (Figs. 5B and 6). P-S6 was also
reduced at 1 hour post-dosing, but after 24 hours of treatment, P-S6
levels remained lower in H1047R tumors. The percentage of Ki67positive cells decreased in NVP-BEZ235–treated animals at 1 hour
after last drug administration, an effect that persisted 24 hours after
the last dosage only in H1047R tumors (Fig. 5C). P-4EBP1 was not
significantly changed by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).
In the same mice, we performed immunohistochemistry for
levels of P-Akt, P-S6, and P-4EBP1 in normal skin at 1 hour after
last drug administration. In the basal layer of skin, P-Akt, P-S6, and
P-4EBP1 were significantly reduced upon NVP-BEZ235 treatment,
1 hour after last drug administration (Fig. 6A and B). These findings
are similar to those observed in the tumors and suggest that skin
may be a good surrogate tissue to study PI3K and mTOR inhibition.

Discussion
NVP-BEZ235 is an ATP competitor that potently and reversibly
reduces the kinase activity of both p110 and mTOR. Consequently, it
inhibits several PI3K pathway effectors, among them the serine/
threonine-specific protein kinase Akt, the ribosomal protein S6, and

www.aacrjournals.org

the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1
(4EBP1) and induces nuclear translocation of forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 (FOXO3a). The reported IC50s for Thr308-P-Akt
and Ser473-P-Akt are 29 and 8 nmol/L, respectively, and 6.5 nmol/L
for mTOR (26). In our hands, the cellular IC50 for Akt phosphorylation measured by Western blot was significantly higher than that
previously reported in the literature. This may be explained by
differences in the assays employed, the cell lines tested and the
durations of treatment. Also, the fact that p70 S6K, the upstream
kinase of S6 ribosomal protein, is sequentially activated by both
mTORC1 and PDK1 may explain why S6 phosphorylation is more
sensitive to NVP-BEZ235 than Ser473-P-Akt (activated only by
mTORC2). Thus, the inactivation of p70S6K may be an additive
effect because its two major activator kinases are blocked by NVPBEZ235. Furthermore, the disruption of the p70 S6K–IRS-1 feedback
could explain, at least in part, an overall increase in Akt
phosphorylation at times/concentrations when p70 S6K is inhibited.
This effect varies between cell lines and over time. In DU145
prostate cancer cells, the IGF-IR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
NVP-AEW541 was effective in preventing the Akt phosphorylation
caused by both NVP-BEZ235 and everolimus, indicating that
blocking upstream signaling may prevent the effects of negative

feedback loop disruption in these cells. Higher doses of NVPBEZ235 (500 nmol/L) are also sufficient to fully prevent this
increased upstream signaling. On the contrary, in BT474 and MDA468 cells, IGF-IR inhibition did not revert the P-Akt induction seen
at low doses of the dual inhibitor, leading us to postulate that
alternative mechanisms could also account for the increased P-Akt
(Supplementary Fig. S2). This observation has clinical implications
because some patients treated with rapamycin analogues showed
an increase in P-Akt in tumors and thus this effect has been
postulated to be one of the reasons for their lack of clinical activity
(32, 34). Therefore, it may be desirable to achieve dual inhibition of
both mTOR and p110 in order to prevent this increase in P-Akt,
which is reached by NVP-BEZ235 in the tested cells at doses
>500 nmol/L.
In our studies, we found a lack of correlation between basal
activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway and biochemical activity of NVPBEZ235. It could be an indication that this agent blocks Akt in full
regardless of its level of activation, in a similar fashion as it occurs
with other kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib in erbB2-positive
tumors. It is already known that in breast cancer, the activity of the
PI3K/mTOR axis is often regulated by other signaling elements,
such as HER2 overexpression or PTEN loss of function, which
generally results in high levels of P-Akt. In agreement with this, we
found that MDA-468 (PTEN ), BT474, and SkBr3 (both HER2+)
have high levels of P-Akt. Because PI3K behaves as a ‘‘bottleneck’’ in
which these and other pathways converge, a plausible explanation
is that inhibiting PI3K with NVP-BEZ235 prevents Akt activation
independently of the upstream pathways involved. This would

support the lack of correlation between the compound’s biochemical activity and basal levels of P-Akt. Regardless of the cause, this is
an important observation because this data suggests that in
patients, therapy with NVP-BEZ235 should not be selected based
on the basal levels of P-Akt in the tumors.
NVP-BEZ235 blocked proliferation in all of the cancer cell lines
tested (n = 21), independently of their PI3K pathway mutation
status. In addition, NVP-BEZ235 was superior to everolimus in all
tested cell lines. The differential sensitivity to the dual pan-PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235) versus the allosteric mTORC1
inhibitor (everolimus) is likely to be due to the different mechanisms
of action of these two agents. We believe that the higher activity of
NVP-BEZ235 is due to inhibition of p110. At low doses, both
compounds inhibit mTOR signaling and mTOR-dependent proliferation. At higher doses, everolimus’ antiproliferative effects reach a
plateau whereas the dual inhibitor continues to increase its
antiproliferative effects that are maximal at higher concentrations
(z100 nmol/L). Importantly, inhibition of P-Thr308-Akt by
NVP-BEZ235 also occurs at concentrations z100 nmol/L, suggesting that the increased antiproliferative activity of NVP-BEZ235 is
due to PI3K inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S1).
In terms of any relationship between K-Ras mutations and
sensitivity to NVP-BEZ235, we observed that MDA-231 cells,
harboring a K-Ras mutation, responded poorly to NVP-BEZ235,
suggesting that K-Ras mutation could signal for resistance to the
dual inhibitor. Consequently, we studied a possible correlation
between sensitivity to NVP-BEZ235 and mutation status in a panel
of 27 cancer cell lines. We found that cell lines harboring either

K-Ras or B-Raf mutations, or EGFR amplification were slightly
less sensitive to NVP-BEZ235 than the rest of the tested
cells. Nevertheless, the GI50s were relatively low (between 5 and
30 nmol/L) for all the tested cell lines. This may be explained by the
predominant mTOR-inhibitory activity of NVP-BEZ235 we have
observed in this concentration range (Fig. 1A).
NVP-BEZ235 equally targets wild-type and mutated p110-a.
Maira and colleagues reported similar IC50s for wild-type 110-a and
the oncogenic mutations E545K and H1047R in enzyme assays,
likely due to the fact that these mutations do not interfere with the
ATP-binding pocket, where the drug reversibly binds.5 Here, we
have shown that NVP-BEZ235 reduced PI3K pathway activity in
either p110-a wild-type or endogenously mutated cells. Moreover,
NVP-BEZ235 targets the E545K and H1047R hotspot mutations

when overexpressed in a cell line with low P-Akt levels (MDA-231),
indicating that the use of this drug is appropriate for tumors
harboring p110-a mutations. The observed inhibition of the PI3K
pathway occurred in parallel to reduced cellular proliferation,
potent G1 arrest and increased expression of apoptotic markers
such as cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP.
The fact that NVP-BEZ235 targets both wild-type and mutated
p110-a has important implications. Increased signaling of PI3K
may occur via upstream or lateral activation (such as via receptor
signaling or PTEN loss of function) or by the presence of activating
mutations in PI3K itself. It is likely that inhibition of this pathway
in any of these circumstances results in similar antiproliferative
effects. Thus, an agent such as NVP-BEZ235 that can effectively
target both wild-type and mutated p110-a has the potential for
wider applicability in the clinic.
As an example, it has been shown that some HER2-positive
patients are refractory to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody

trastuzumab due to the presence of oncogenic mutations in p110-a
or PTEN loss (19). We have observed trastuzumab resistance by overexpressing the E545K and H1047R hotspot mutations in two HER2amplified cell lines (BT474 and SkBr3 cells). This intrinsic resistance
to trastuzumab was overcome by NVP-BEZ235, which showed
similar activity in cells bearing either wild-type or mutated p110-a
and was able to inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt in all cells.
The antitumor activity of NVP-BEZ235 was also evaluated in vivo
using a xenograft model of BT474-derived cells overexpressing
either the p110-a H1047R oncogenic mutation or an empty vector
(mock control). NVP-BEZ235 significantly reduced tumor growth of
both H1047R and empty vector control xenografts. Interestingly, in
our hands, the H1047R-overexpressing tumors responded better to
the treatment. We could speculate that this increased response was
due to a sustained P-S6 suppression and reduced proliferation
(Ki67 low) throughout the whole treatment period.
Nowadays, the identification of potential biomarkers is of
tremendous importance as targeted therapeutics evolve. These
biomarkers aim to serve as surrogates that can correlate drug
activity and target down-regulation. For this reason, we have
quantified P-Akt, P-S6, P-4EBP1 and the percentage of Ki67 positive
cells, in tumor xenografts and mouse skin, as end points to assess
in vivo NVP-BEZ235 activity. The levels of P-Akt and P-S6RP were
significantly reduced 1 hour after NVP-BEZ235 dosage both in
tumor xenografts and skin, suggesting that the latter could be used

as a surrogate marker of target down-regulation in patients treated
with NVP-BEZ235.
The present work shows that NVP-BEZ235 specifically inhibits
activated signaling in both wild-type and mutated p110-a, both in
cellular models and in xenografts. Importantly, inhibition of p110
and mTOR signaling consistently offers an antiproliferative
advantage than inhibiting mTOR alone. Taken together with the
work by Maira and colleagues, in which NVP-BEZ235 showed
activity in cells with PTEN loss, our observations offer a valid
therapeutic alternative for the treatment of solid tumors with
mutated PI3K.
