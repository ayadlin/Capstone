Abstract
Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) is a histone acetyltransferase and nuclear hormone receptor coactivator, located on 20q12, which is amplified in several epithelial cancers and well studied in breast
cancer. However, its possible role in lung cancer pathogenesis is unknown. We found SRC-3 to be overexpressed in 27% of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (n = 311) by immunohistochemistry,
which correlated with poor disease-free (P = 0.0015) and overall (P = 0.0008) survival. Twenty-seven percent of NSCLCs exhibited SRC-3 gene amplification, and we found that lung cancer cell lines expressed
higher levels of SRC-3 than did immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), which in turn expressed higher levels of SRC-3 than did cultured primary human HBECs. Small interfering RNA–mediated
downregulation of SRC-3 in high-expressing, but not in low-expressing, lung cancer cells significantly inhibited tumor cell growth and induced apoptosis. Finally, we found that SRC-3 expression is inversely
correlated with gefitinib sensitivity and that SRC-3 knockdown results in epidermal growth factor receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor–resistant lung cancers becoming more sensitive to gefitinib. Taken together, these
data suggest that SRC-3 may be an important oncogene and therapeutic target for lung cancer. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3; AIB1/ACTR/RAC3/
p/CIP) is a member of the p160 SRC family. SRC-3 has histone acetyltransferase activity and interacts with multiple
nuclear receptors and transcription factors to regulate the
expression of their target genes, including estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), E2F1, NF-κB, and activator
protein-1 (1). SRC-3 also plays a role in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (2).

SRC-3 has been implicated in the development of many
human cancers. Amplification and overexpression of SRC-3
is detected in 5% to 10% of ovarian and 30% to 60% of breast
cancers (3). SRC-3 overexpression in breast cancer is associated with high levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) and EGFR, tamoxifen resistance, and
poor disease-free survival, suggesting that there may be
cross-talk between the SRC-3, HER2/neu, and ER signaling
pathways in the genesis and progression of some breast tumors (4, 5). SRC-3 is also amplified and overexpressed in
many other types of cancer, including prostate cancer (6),
ER- and PR-negative breast cancer (7), and gastric cancer
and colorectal carcinoma (1). Increased SRC-3 expression is
also observed during pancreatic cancer (8) and esophageal
tumor progression (9). However, a comprehensive profiling
of SRC-3 gene and protein expression levels in lung cancers
is lacking, as is knowledge of the function of SRC-3 in lung
cancer cell survival and proliferation.
In this study, we show that SRC-3 is overexpressed in a
subset of lung cancers, which correlates with poor diseasefree and overall survival and, in some cases, is associated
with DNA amplification. Knockdown of SRC-3 in lung
cancers leads to reduced cell growth, decreased anchorageindependent colony formation ability, and increased apoptosis in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with high
endogenous levels of SRC-3. In addition, we show that SRC-3
knockdown can potentiate the effect of gefitinib in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)–resistant cells.

Materials and Methods
Case selection and tissue microarray construction
We obtained archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissues from surgically resected (with curative intent)
NSCLC specimens (lobectomies and pneumonectomies) containing tumor and adjacent normal epithelium tissues from
the Lung Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence
Tissue Bank at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, Texas), under a protocol approved by
the institutional review board. The tissues had been collected
from 1997 to 2001. The tissue specimens were histologically
examined and classified using the 2004 WHO classification
system (10). We selected 311 NSCLC tissue samples (188 adenocarcinomas and 123 squamous cell carcinomas) for our
tissue microarrays (TMA). TMAs were constructed using
triplicate 1-mm-diameter cores per tumor, and each core included central, intermediate, and peripheral tumor tissues.
Detailed clinical and pathologic information, including demographics, smoking history (never and ever smokers),
smoking status (never, former, and current), clinical and
pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, overall survival duration, and time to recurrence, was available for most
cases. Patients who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in
their lifetime were defined as smokers, and smokers who quit
smoking at least 12 months before their lung cancer diagnosis were defined as former smokers. Tumors were pathologic
TNM stages I to IV according to the revised International
System for Staging Lung Cancer.
Immunohistochemical staining, evaluation, and
statistical analysis of clinical correlation
Using anti–SRC-3/AIB-1 mouse monoclonal antibody from
BD Transduction Laboratories (6), immunohistochemical
staining was performed as follows: Five-micrometer FFPE tissue sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, heated in a
steamer for 10 minutes with 10 mmol/L sodium citrate
(pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval, and washed in Tris buffer. Peroxide blocking was done with 3% H2O2 in methanol at room
temperature for 15 minutes, followed by 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in Tris-buffered saline-T for 30 minutes. The slides
were incubated with primary antibody at 4°C for 90 minutes,
washed with PBS, and incubated with biotin-labeled secondary antibody (Envision Dual Link +, DAKO) for 30 minutes.
Staining for the slides was developed with 0.05% 3′,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, which had been freshly prepared in 0.05 mol/L Tris buffer at pH 7.6 containing 0.024%
H2O2, and then the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. FFPE A549 cells were used as
a positive control. For the negative control, we used the same
specimens used for the positive controls but replaced the primary antibody with PBS. For this antibody, we performed titration experiments using a relatively wide range of antibody
concentrations (1:50, 1:100, 1:200, and 1:500), including the
concentration suggested by the manufacturer. One observer
(M.G.R.) quantified the immunohistochemical expression using light microscopy (magnification, ×20). Both nuclear and
cytoplasmic expressions were quantified using a four-value

6478

intensity score (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+) and the percentage (0–
100%) of reactivity. We defined the intensity categories as
follows: 0, no appreciable staining; 1+, barely detectable staining in epithelial cells compared with the stromal cells; 2+, readily appreciable staining; and 3+, dark brown staining of cells.
Next, an expression score was obtained by multiplying the intensity and reactivity percent values (theoretical range, 0–300).
There were three cores of tissue per case in the TMA. On each
core, the score was obtained as described earlier. The average
of the three cores was used as the score for this case.
Progression was defined as either disease recurrence or
death; survival time was defined as the time from diagnosis
to death (or disease progression), which was censored by the
last known number of follow-up days. Lung cancer patients
were dichotomized into high SRC-3 expression group (>1.67)
and low SRC-3 expression group (≤1.67), and the cutoff value
was the median SRC-3 expression among all lung cancer
samples.
Array comparative genomic hybridization
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on cDNA microarrays was carried out as previously described (11). Briefly, 4 μg of tumor and normal sex-matched reference genomic
DNA were random primer labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively, then hybridized to a cDNA microarray (Stanford
microarray core) containing ∼39,000 cDNAs representing
∼26,000 mapped genes/expressed sequence tags. Hybridized
arrays were scanned on a GenePix scanner (Axon Instruments), and fluorescence ratios extracted using SpotReader
software (Niles). Normalized log 2 ratios were then mapped
onto the genome using the National Center for Biotechnology Information genome assembly (Build 36). A preliminary
report of these data (focused on TITF1 amplification) was recently published (12). Copy number at the SRC-3 locus was
determined with the cghFLasso algorithm using a false discovery rate of 0.001 (13).
Cell lines and cell culture
All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
5% FBS (Invitrogen). Most of these cell lines were established
by John D. Minna and Adi Gazdar at the National Cancer Institute and the Hamon Cancer Center for Therapeutic Oncology at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (14,
15). The other cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All of the cell lines have
been DNA fingerprinted for provenance using the PowerPlex
1.2 kit (Promega). The DNA fingerprints were all confirmed
to be same as in the DNA fingerprint library maintained by
ATCC or the Minna/Gazdar lab (which is the primary source
of the lines). The lines were also tested to be free of Mycoplasma
by e-Myco kit (Boca Scientific).
Reverse transcription
Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer's instruction. First-strand cDNA
was reverse transcribed with 3 μg of mRNA using the Superscript II first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The final
volume was 20 μL.

Role of SRC-3 in Lung Cancer

Quantitative PCR
TaqMan Gene Expression Assays for the SRC-3/NCoA3
gene and the internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene were purchased from Applied
Biosystems. To generate the standard curve, serial dilution of
MCF-7 cDNAs was run in triplicate for both SRC-3 and
GAPDH. Efficiency for both primer and probe is almost as
high as 2 [E = 10(−1/slope) = 10(−1/−3.3) ≈ 2 (data not
shown)], making the ΔΔCt method appropriate for use in
data analysis.
For the SRC-3 expression in 33 tested cell lines, all the
cDNAs were run for both SRC-3 and GAPDH in triplicate.
Threshold and baseline were set up similarly for both relative
standard curve generation and comparative Ct generation for
the whole panel. In each group of cells [i.e., NSCLC versus
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) versus human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC)], the cell line that expresses the lowest
level of SRC-3 in the group is defined as 1, and the other lines
are relative levels to the lowest one, using [relative expression
level = 100 × 2−ΔΔCt] for calculation.

EGFR inhibitor treatment
Clinical-grade gefitinib and cetuximab were obtained from
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center pharmacy. Gefitinib was dissolved in DMSO to prepare a
10 mmol/L stock drug solution, which was stored at 4°C.
The NSCLC cell line H1819 was treated with SRC-3–specific
siRNA, nontargeting siRNA pool, or transfection reagent only
24 hours after 100 nmol/L gefitinib was added to the medium; 72 hours later, cells were harvested for Annexin V staining. Treated H1819 cells were trypsinized, counted, and then
resuspended in 1× binding buffer (BD Pharmingen; 1 × 106
cells/mL). Annexin V-FITC (5 μL) and propidium iodide
(5 μL; BD Pharmingen) were added; the solution was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes; and
staining was quenched by adding 400 μL of 1× binding buffer
to 100 μL of cells. Flow cytometry analysis was done, with the
percentage of Annexin V–positive cells normalized to the
transfection reagent-only treatment.

Immunoblot analysis
All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
5% FBS (Invitrogen); cells were grown to 80% confluency before lysis. Cell lysates were prepared with 1% SDS–containing
lysis buffer followed by boiling. Cell extracts with equal
amounts of proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting.
The SRC-3/AIB1 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories)
was used at 1:2,000 dilution. Antibodies for cleaved
caspase-7 (1:1,000) and phospho-SRC-3 (Thr24; 1:1,000) were
from Cell Signaling Technology and antibody for GAPDH was
from Santa Cruz. Western blot band intensity is quantified
using ImageJ following the program instruction.

SRC-3 expression is highly variable in NSCLCs, and
patients whose tumors have high SRC-3 expression
have inferior prognosis
Using a specific anti–SRC-3 antibody, we performed semiquantitative immunohistochemistry on a TMA of 311 clinically annotated NSCLCs and found a wide range of tumor
SRC-3 expression (nuclear staining; Fig. 1; see also Materials
and Methods): 85 NSCLCs (27%) expressed SRC-3 (staining
score ≥10), 144 (46%) showed no SRC-3 staining, whereas
84 (27%) exhibited a SRC-3 nuclear staining score between
0 and 10. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on the 215patient subset for which clinical data including survival were
available. As shown in Fig. 1C, patients whose tumors have
high SRC-3 levels by immunohistochemistry have significantly shorter overall (P = 0.0008, log-rank test) and progressionfree (P = 0.0015, log-rank test) survival time than patients
with low SRC-3 levels. The median overall survival time
was 54 months for the high SRC-3 expression group and 98
months for the low SRC-3 expression group (Fig. 1C). After
adjusting for the effects of histology, gender, race, tobacco,
stage, and lymph node status in the multivariate proportional hazard survival model, high SRC-3 was still significantly
associated with poor overall (hazard ratio, 2.02; P = 0.0007)
and progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.92; P = 0.0011;
Table 1). Importantly, the expression of SRC-3 did not correlate with EGFR mutation (P = 0.365, t test) or KRAS mutation
(P = 0.256, t test; Supplementary Table S1).

Reverse-phase protein array
Protein lysates were prepared as previously described (16).
Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) was produced and analyzed as previously described, with slight modifications (17).
RPPA data were quantified using the SuperCurve method,
which detects changes in protein level with MicroVigene software (VigeneTech) and an R package developed in-house (18).
Small interfering RNA transfection
Human SRC-3 SMARTpool small interfering RNA (siRNA)
and nonspecific control siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon Research, Inc. siRNAs were transfected with Dharmafect
2 (Dharmacon) into H1299, Dharmafect 4 into H1819, Dharmafect 3 into H2073, and Dharmafect 1 into A549 at 50 nmol/L
following the reverse transfection protocol.
Liquid colony formation assay
Forty-eight hours after siRNA treatment, cells were harvested and counted and single cells were seeded (500–2,000
cells per well) in triplicate into six-well plates. Cells were
grown for 11, 12, or 14 days (for H1299, H1819, and H2073,
respectively); colonies were stained with methylene blue
(0.5% in 70% isopropyl alcohol) or crystal violet for 1 hour
at room temperature and counted.

levels in NSCLC and breast cancer lines
Analysis of SRC-3 (at 20q12) DNA copy number alterations
by array-based CGH in a panel of lung and breast cancer cell
lines revealed SRC-3 copy number gain in 14 of 55 (25%)
NSCLC lines, 8 of 23 (35%) SCLC lines, and 15 of 31 (48%) breast
cancer cell lines, whereas 4 of 55 (7%) NSCLC lines, 1 of 23 (4%)
of SCLC, and 1 of 31 (3%) breast cancer cell lines showed
copy number loss at this locus (Supplementary Table S2).

SRC-3 expression level of NSCLCs was greater than that of the

the nonimmortalized HBECs. The means and 95% confidence

HBEC-KT, and HBEC-UI are significant (Fig. 2A). The NSCLC
lines (HCC44, HCC15, and H28) with SRC-3 expression level
lower than that in HBECs were those with SRC-3 DNA copy
number loss. In addition, SRC-3 protein expression was highly
variable in HBEC and NSCLC lines as analyzed by Western
blotting (Fig. 2B).
The function of SRC-3 is regulated by protein phosphorylation, and among the eight mapped phosphorylation sites in
SRC-3, modification of Thr24 is crucial for the interaction
with ER, androgen receptor, and NF-κB to achieve maximum
transcriptional coactivation activity (19). Phosphorylation at
this site is also important for the transforming ability of SRC-3
(19). Using an anti–phospho-SRC-3 (Thr24) specific antibody,
we found the phosphorylation level of SRC-3 to be highly variable among the lung cancer cell and HBEC lines (Fig. 2B).
For example, HBEC13KT and H2073 show no detectable
pSRC-3, although they express modest amounts of total protein. On the other hand, H1299 has the highest pSRC-3/SRC-3
ratio, although it does not express the highest level of total
SRC-3 protein.
Inhibition of SRC-3 expression in high-expressing
NSCLC cells significantly decreases cell growth and
elicits a proapoptotic response
To investigate whether the cells expressing high levels of
SRC-3 rely on it for survival and proliferation, a pool of four
siRNA oligonucleotides targeting SRC-3 was transfected into

H1299, which expresses significant levels of both total and
phosphorylated (Thr24) SRC-3. The cell viability and liquid
colony formation were found to be decreased by more than
70% when SRC-3 was knocked down (Fig. 3). Cleaved
caspase-7 expression was detected 72 hours after siRNA
transfection and was sustained up to 96 hours, indicating
that SRC-3 knockdown in H1299 cells is associated with activation of the apoptosis pathway (Fig. 3A). The SMARTpool
siRNAs targeting SRC-3 had been deconvoluted into the individual targeting sequences, and the degree of SRC-3 knockdown is correlated with the degree of effect observed
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Note that the control siRNA oligo
itself was somewhat toxic and rendered a modest effect
(∼20% reduction) on cell viability, yet showed no effect on
the caspase activation. Contrary to the results in H1299 cells,
H1819 and H2073 NSCLCs (expressing medium and low
SRC-3 levels, respectively) showed only modest or no effect
on growth and liquid colony formation after SRC-3 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that
only NSCLCs expressing high levels of SRC-3 (or pSRC-3)
show dependence on continued SRC-3 expression for survival
and growth.
SRC-3 knockdown sensitizes NSCLC to
EGFR antagonists
Several studies have revealed a relationship between SRC-3
expression level and EGFR family pathway signaling in breast

cancer (4, 5). Thus, we wished to know if SRC-3 expression in
NSCLC correlates with the response to EGFR-targeted chemotherapy. We examined the expression of 160 proteins potentially involved in signaling and oncogenesis by RPPAs
using validated antibodies and correlated protein levels with
in vitro sensitivity and resistance to erlotinib, gefitinib, and
cetuximab in 48 NSCLC lines using an MTS proliferation assay (20). High EGFR protein expression (often associated
with the presence of EGFR oncogenic mutations and amplification) correlated with cetuximab, erlotinib, and gefitinib
sensitivity (Supplementary Table S3), whereas high SRC-3
protein expression correlated with resistance to these drugs
(Fig. 4A). This result led us to question if SRC-3 knockdown
would sensitize NSCLCs with wild-type EGFR to EGFR TKIs.
H1819 is a NSCLC cell line expressing moderate levels of
SRC-3 and with wild-type EGFR but shows phosphorylation
of EGFR, HER2, ErbB3, and downstream effectors such as
AKT and P44/42 extracellular signal–regulated kinase, indicating that the EGFR pathway is active (Supplementary
Fig. S3; ref. 20). H1819 cells are resistant to gefitinib (IC50,
15 μmol/L), and knocking down SRC-3 via siRNA in these
cells only led to a modest growth reduction (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Whereas neither of these treatments alone elicited
apoptosis (with gefitinib given at 0.1 μmol/L, a concentration that is within the range of achievable serum levels
in patients), combined siRNA SRC-3 knockdown and
0.1 μmol/L gefitinib led to induction of apoptosis detected
by Annexin V staining (Fig. 4B). Also, cells treated with SRC3–targeted siRNA and gefitinib were less well attached,

rounded up, and showed a “spider web”–like appearance
when compared with cells treated with SRC-3 siRNA or gefitinib alone (not shown).

Discussion
Studies of SRC-3 in lung cancer have revealed DNA copy
number increases and great variation in expression levels,
with ∼25% of NSCLCs dramatically overexpressing this
gene compared with other NSCLCs, normal lung epithelium, and immortalized HBECs. Patients whose tumor
showed SRC-3 overexpression also had inferior survival
compared with those with low or no SRC-3 expression. Increased expression was also associated with SRC-3 DNA
copy number increase. This frequency of high SRC-3 expression is comparable to that found in breast, ovarian,
and prostate cancers, all of which can become dependent
on SRC-3 for proliferation (3, 6, 7). In addition, NSCLCs
varied in their levels of pSRC-3 expression, and the variations in SRC-3 DNA copy number and mRNA, protein, and
phosphoprotein levels suggest that there is regulation of
SRC-3 at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels. For example, a recent study identified a ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, which can directly target SRC-3 for
ubiquitinylation and degradation, and these changes inhibit
the anchorage-independent cell growth and the metastatic
potential of cancer cells (21). This is consistent with our
general finding that siRNA-mediated SRC-3 knockdown

correlation analysis with drug sensitivity suggests a relationship between high SRC-3 expression and EGFR TKI resistance. For a panel of 48 NSCLC lines,
the expression levels of a panel of proteins were quantified using RPPA and correlated (Pearson values determined) with the IC50 values (MTS assay)
for gefitinib, erlotinib, and cetuximab. Red, a correlation of increased IC50 values (resistance) with increased expression of the particular protein; green,
a correlation of decreased IC50 values (sensitivity) with increased expression of a protein. Color brightness level indicates the level of the Pearson
correlation, with bright red levels found with SRC-3 representing R values of >0.7 of protein with IC50 values. B, SRC-3 knockdown combined with 0.1 μmol/L

inhibited cell growth and colony formation in NSCLCs expressing high levels of SRC-3 and pSRC-3, whereas little or
no effects of SRC-3 knockdown were seen in NSCLCs with
low endogenous SRC-3 levels. It is true that in the
A549 cell line, which expresses the highest level of the
protein, knockdown of SRC-3 resulted in only a 20% reduction in cell viability. However, we were unsuccessful in
achieving efficient knockdown in this line; the maximum
knockdown efficiency was 50% using up to 100 nmol/L

siRNAs, which still left a significant amount of SRC-3
protein in the cells.
Finally, we discovered a correlation between SRC-3 expression levels and resistance to EGFR TKIs gefitinib and
erlotinib. SRC-3 knockdown led to dramatic sensitization
of NSCLC with wild-type EGFR to EGFR TKI targeted therapy. The mechanism by which SRC-3 knockdown leads to
gefitinib sensitization remains to be elucidated. One possibility is that SRC-3 might be crucial for the activation of

Role of SRC-3 in Lung Cancer

other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as insulin-like growth
factor-I (IGF-I) receptor, in lung cancers that can bypass
EGFR to activate critical downstream signaling pathways.
For example, SRC-3 is known to mediate IGF-I–induced
phenotypic changes in human breast cancer cells (22) and
SRC-3 deficiency affects breast cancer initiation and progression in mice (23). After this article was submitted for review,
an article was published which showed that overexpression
and amplification of SRC-3 was found in 48.3% and 8.2% of
NSCLCs, respectively, and that overexpression of SRC-3 negatively affects the survival of surgically resected NSCLC patients (24). This article provides an independent validation
of our findings. The difference in overexpression and amplifi-

cation frequencies is most likely due to the fact that an Asian
population was the subject of their experiments, whereas a
Caucasian population was the subject of ours.
Taken together, our results suggest that SRC-3 is an important new oncogene and potential therapeutic target for lung
cancer.
