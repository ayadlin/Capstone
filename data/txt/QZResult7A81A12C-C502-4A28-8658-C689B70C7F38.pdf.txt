ABSTRACT
As the primary cause of lung cancer, tobacco smoke (TS) promotes the initiation
and progression of lung tumorigenesis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
a crucial process involved in cell malignant transformation. The role of ERK5, the
lesser studied member of MAPKs family, in regulating TS-triggered pulmonary EMT
has not been investigated. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells and BALB/c mice
were used as in vitro and in vivo TS exposure models. Exposure of normal human
bronchial epithelial cells to TS for 7 days induced morphological change, enhanced
migratory and invasive capacities, reduced epithelial marker expression and increased
mesenchymal marker expression. Importantly, we demonstrated for the first time
that ERK5 negatively regulated TS-mediated lung epithelial EMT, as evidenced by
the findings that TS suppressed ERK5 activation, and that TS-triggered EMT was
mimicked with ERK5 inhibition and reversed by ERK5 overexpression. The negative
regulation of ERK5 on pulmonary EMT was further confirmed in mice exposed to
TS for 12 weeks. Taken together, our data suggest that ERK5 negatively regulates
TS-mediated pulmonary EMT. These findings provide new insight into the molecular
mechanisms of TS-associated lung tumorigenesis and may open up new avenues in
the search for potential target of lung cancer intervention.

development as well as cancer development [7–9]. During
EMT process, cells lose their epithelial traits and acquire
mesenchymal features. Evidences have suggested that,
in addition to facilitating tumor invasion and metastasis,
EMT is also critically involved in the initiation of
tumorigenesis. Exposure of cells to carcinogens induces
EMT during malignant transformation [10–14]. TS has
been documented to promote EMT which regulates early
events in lung carcinogenesis [13, 15–21]. Nonetheless,
the underlying mechanisms by which TS induces EMT are
poorly understood.
The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
include four major subfamilies: extracellular regulated
protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), the Jun N-terminal

INTRODUCTION
Tobacco smoke (TS) is causally associated
with various types of cancers, especially lung cancer.
Epidemiological and experimental studies have revealed
the positive link between TS and risk of lung cancer
development as well as other cancers [1–5] . It is estimated
TS accounts for 80–90% of all lung cancer. Although
enormous progress in understanding its molecular
mechanisms leading to lung cancer development has
been made, the molecular pathogenesis remains largely
unknown [6].

kinases (JNKs), p38, and ERK5 [22, 23]. ERK5, also
termed big MAPK1 (BMK1), is the least studied member
of MAPKs family. The MEK5/ERK5 pathway is implicated
in important cellular processes, including gene expression,
proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell motility and
differentiation [24–27]. While some reports have suggested
the functions of ERK5 in cancer oncogenesis, its role in EMT
regulation has not been well explored. It has been shown that
ERK5 promotes EMT in MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, MDAMB-453 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells [28–30]. ERK5
triggers a motility and invasive phenotype of prostate cancer
cells [31], osteosarcoma cells [32] and mesothelioma cells
[33]. Importantly, several lines of evidence have suggested a
differential regulatory role of ERK5 on EMT. Activation of
ERK5 suppresses EMT in both Hs578T and MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells [34]. ERK5 inhibits NF-κB activity,
an essential step for EMT, in myoblast cells [35]. It has
been reported that ERK5 positively regulates keratinocyte
and vascular smooth muscle cell migration [36, 37], but
negatively regulates hepatic and endothelial cell migration
[38–40]. Therefore, ERK5 regulation of EMT may depend
on cell types and/or cellular microenvironment.
To date, no studies have been done to examine
the action of ERK5 in TS-induced lung epithelial EMT.
Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate
ERK5 regulation of TS-induced EMT. By using in vitro
and in vivo TS exposure models, we demonstrate for the
first time that ERK5 negatively regulated TS-mediated
EMT. These novel findings indicate the important role of
ERK5 activity in TS-associated carcinogenesis and may
open new avenues in search for potential interventional
target of TS-associated lung tumorigenesis.

significantly increased NHBE cell migration (Figure 1C).
Similarly, invasion of cells through reconstituted matrigel
matrices was enhancedby CSE (Figure 1D). To determine
whether molecular alterations of EMT occurred in CSE
treated cells, the expression levels of EMT markers were
determined. As measured by Western blot analyses, exposure
of NHBE cells to CSE resulted in significant decreases in
the protein expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin
and ZO-1. The levels of E-cadherin at 1% CSE, 2% CSE
and 4% CSE were 95.61%, 62.09% (p < 0.05) and 40.96%
(p < 0.01) of the control, respectively; the levels of ZO-1 at
1% CSE, 2% CSE and 4% CSE were 93.03%, 60.82% (p <
0.05) and 42.67% (p < 0.01) of the control, respectively. In
contrast, CSE treatment significantly increased the protein
levels of mesenchymal markers Vimentin and N-cadherin.
CSE at concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% caused 65.36% (p
< 0.05), 93.67% (p < 0.01) and 180.54% (p < 0.01) increases
in Vimentin, and –1.13%, 95% (p < 0.01) and 120.31% (p
< 0.01) increases in N-cadherin, respectively (Figure 2A).
Immunofluorescent staining also showed that CSE decreased
E-cadherin protein expression and increased Vimentin
expression in NHBE cells (Figure 2B). Moreover, qRT-PCR
analyses revealed similar changes in the mRNA levels of
epithelial and mesenchymal markers in NHBE cells exposed
to CSE (Figure 2C). Collectively, data from morphological,
migratory/invasive and molecular changes demonstrated that
TS exposure induced EMT in human lung epithelial cells in
a concentration-dependent manner.

TS-induced pulmonary EMT is associated with
ERK5 suppression
As the lesser studied member of MAPKs family,
ERK5 is implicated in cancer oncogenesis. The function
of ERK5 in EMT regulation has not been well explored,
and several lines of evidence have suggested that
differential regulatory role of ERK5 on EMT may exist.
To determine whether TS-elicited pulmonary cell EMT is
associated with change in ERK5 activation, the level of
phosphorylated ERK5, an indicator of ERK5 activation
status, was measured. Exposure of NHBE cells to CSE
for 7 days decreased phosphorylated ERK5 level. The
levels of phospho-ERK5 at 1% CSE, 2% CSE and 4%
CSE were 80.36%, 42.38% (p < 0.01) and 22.62% (p <
0.01) of the control, respectively. These results suggested
the suppressive effect of TS on ERK5 activity. Meanwhile,
CSE increased the activation of AP-1 protein in NHBE
cells, as indicated by elevated levels of phosphorylated-cJun and phosphorylated c-Fos (Figure 3).

RESULTS
TS induces EMT in normal human lung
epithelial cells
TS is the most important risk factor for lung
cancer, and TS-induced EMT is critically involved in TSassociated malignant transformation. To investigate the
effect of TS on EMT induction, NHBE cells were exposed
to various concentrations of cigarette smoke extract (CSE)
for 7 days. Cell viability was not apparently affected in cells
treated with CSE at concentrations up to 4% (Figure 1A).
Therefore, 4% CSE was selected as the maximum
concentration for the following experiments.
EMT process is manifested by alterations in cell
morphology, migration and invasion capacity, as well
as expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers.
Treatment of NHBE cells with CSE for 7 days resulted in
significant morphological change from epithelial roundshaped to spindle-like mesenchymal form (Figure 1B).
To further examine the effect of TS on EMT, transwell
assays were carried out to analyze NHBE cell migratory
and invasive capacities inresponse to CSE. CSE treatment

the protein and mRNA levels of the epithelial markers
E-cadherin and ZO-1, as well as up-regulation of the
mesenchymal markers Vimentin and N-cadherin; these
effects were similar to that of TS on NHBE cells (Figure 4E,

play an important role in CSE-induced EMT in NHBE cells.

regulation of ERK5 on CSE-induced EMT in NHBE cells.

To further determine the role of ERK5 in TStriggered EMT, NHBE cells were transfected with
lentiviral ERK5 expression vector at multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 2.5, 5, 10, 25 and 50 for 72 hours.
Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence imaging
showed the successful transfection of NHBE cells with
a MOI of 25 as the optimal infection efficiency. After
transfection of ERK5 vector, NHBE cells were exposed
to CSE for 7 days. Results showed that ERK5 expression
vector restored CSE-suppressed ERK5 activity and
prevented CSE-triggered activation of AP-1 subunits
(c-Fos, c-Jun and Fos B) in NHBE cells (Figure 5A).
Overexpression of ERK5 decreased CSE-mediated
migration and invasion capacities of NHBE cells (Figure
5B, 5C). In addition, Western blot analyses showed
that stable transfection of ERK5 with lentiviral vector
attenuated CSE-induced decrease of E-cadherin and ZO-1
levels, as well as increase of Vimentin and N-cadherin
in NHBE cells (Figure 6A). Immunofluorescent assay

Following the illustration of the negative regulatory
function of ERK5 in CSE-induced pulmonary EMT in
vitro, we further investigated whether TS induces EMTlike changes and modulates ERK5 activation in an animal
model. Mice were exposed to TS for 12 weeks, and the
expressions of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and
ZO-1, as well as the mesenchymal markers Vimentin
and N-cadherin in lung tissues were examined. We
revealed that TS exposure significantly decreased protein
and mRNA expressions of E-cadherin and ZO-1, and
significantly elevated the expression of Vimentin and
N-cadherin in the lungs. Western blot analyses showed
that the levels of E-cadherin, ZO-1, Vimentin, and
N-cadherin in TS exposed mice were 30.65% (p < 0.01),
41.96% (p < 0.01), 276.25% (p < 0.01), and 217.58% (p
< 0.01) of the control, respectively (Figure 7A). qRT-PCR
assays showed that TS induced changes in mRNA levels
of these EMT markers were consistent with that of protein
measurements (Figure 7B).

Similarly, in our study we found that exposure
of mice to TS resulted in significant decreased ERK5
activity and increased c-Jun and c-Fos activation in lung
tissues (Figure 7C and 7D). These data were in line with
our in vitro findings. Intriguingly, we also analyzed ERK5
activation status in other tissues of mice exposed to TS
in this study and observed that TS increased, rather than
decreased, ERK5 activation in stomach, liver, kidney and
bladder tissues of mice (Figure 8). These results suggest
tissue specific modulation of TS on ERK5 activation.

mechanisms of TS-related lung tumorigenesis as well as
search for the potential target of lung cancer intervention.
Characterized by changes in cell morphology,
migration and invasion capacity, as well as expression
prolife of epithelial and mesenchymal markers, EMT
is a crucial process in cancer development. Evidences
have revealed that exposure of cells to carcinogens
induces EMT during transformation and tumor formation
[10–14], suggesting the important role of EMT in the
initiation of tumorigenesis by promoting cell malignant
transformation. Tellez et al demonstrated that exposure of
human bronchial epithelial cells to tobacco carcinogens
benzo(a)pyrene-diolepoxide and methylnitrosourea
induces EMT, which is an early manifestation during
transformation process, participating in cancer initiation
and promoting the clonal expansion of premalignant
cells [10]. Evidences also show that EMT is involved
in arsenite-induced transformation of human bronchial
epithelial cells [11, 12]. It has been documented that
TS promotes EMT, resulting in loss of cellular polarity,
down-regulation of epithelial cadherin, loss of cell-cell
adhesion, and increased mobility of lung epithelial cells

DISCUSSION
TS is the primary cause of lung cancer, which
promotes the initiation and progression of lung
tumorigenesis. The underlying molecular mechanisms
by which TS causes lung cancer development remain
to be established. In the present study we revealed that
TS induced EMT in both NHBE cells and the lungs of
mice. Most importantly, we demonstrated for the first time
that ERK5 negatively regulated TS-mediated EMT, as
evidenced by the findings that TS suppressed pulmonary
ERK5 activation, and that TS-triggered EMT phenotypic
alterations was mimicked with ERK5 inhibition and
reversed by ERK5 overexpression. These findings suggest

[15–21]. In agreement with previous reports, we showed
in the present study that exposure to TS induced EMT in
NHBE cells, as manifested by morphological change from
epithelial to mesenchymal form, increased migratory and
invasive capacities, as well as alterations in the expression
of EMT markers, including decreased epithelial markers
E-cadherin and ZO-1, and increased mesenchymal
markers Vimentin and N-cadherin. Moreover, we also
showed that TS exposure resulted in decreased expression
of E-cadherin and ZO-1, as well as increased expression of
Vimentin and N-cadherin in the lungs of mice, suggestive
of EMT induction. Taken together, our data revealed that
TS triggered EMT in both in vitro and in vivo settings.
Several cell signaling factors have been implicated
in EMT. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms of EMT
induction by TS are poorly understood. ERK5 is the lesser
studied member of the proto-oncogenic MAPKs family.
Some reports have depicted the important biological
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

functions of ERK5 in cancer oncogenesis; however, its
role in EMT regulation has not been well characterized,
and the available evidences suggesting the action of ERK5
in EMT process remain elusive. On one hand, it has been
shown that ERK5 promotes EMT in MCF-7 breast cancer
cells [28, 29] and facilitates migration and invasion
of MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453 and SKBR3 breast
cancer cells [30]. ERK5 triggers a motility and invasive
phenotype of prostate cancer cells [31], osteosarcoma cells
[32], and mesothelioma cells [33]. Upregulated ERK5
expression correlates with high-grade prostate cancer and
oral squamous cell carcinoma [42, 43]. On the other hand,
evidences have suggested a differential regulatory role
of ERK5 on EMT. ERK5 activation results in significant
decreased migration and invasion of both Hs578T and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, whereas knockdown
of ERK5 increases cell migratory and invasive capacities
and Vimentin expression, indicating ERK5 as a negative
19613

regulator of EMT in these breast cancer cells [30]. ERK5
positively regulates keratinocyte and vascular smooth
muscle cell migration [36, 37], but negatively regulates
hepatic and endothelial cell migration [38–40]. These
evidences suggest that ERK5 regulation of EMT may be
cell types and/or cellular microenvironment sensitive.
To date, no studies have been done to investigate
the function of ERK5 in TS-induced EMT or in lung
cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In the present
study we showed that TS-induced pulmonary EMT was
associated with suppression of ERK5 activation in vitro
and in vivo. To determine the role of ERK5 in pulmonary
EMT regulation, the inhibitory effect of TS on ERK5 was
mimicked with a highly specific ERK5 inhibitor. Inhibition
of ERK5 alone resulted in effects similar to that of TS on
NHBE cells, including mesenchymal-like morphological
changes, enhanced migratory and invasive capacities,
and alterations in EMT markers expression. Furthermore,
we illustrated that overexpression of ERK5 reversed
TS-triggered EMT in both NHBE cells and the lungs of
mice. Collectively, these data clearly indicated that ERK5
negatively regulated TS-induced pulmonary EMT.
Intriguingly, in the present study we also analyzed
ERK5 activation status in other tissues of mice exposed to
TS. We observed that TS increased, rather than decreased,
ERK5 activity in other tissues such as stomach, liver,
kidney and bladder of mice. These results provided
evidence for the tissue sensitivity of ERK5 activation
regulated by TS. In addition, we compared ERK5
activation in NHBE cells with non-small cell lung cancer
cells and found reduced ERK5 activity in lung cancer
cells (unpublished data). In supporting our finding is
the observation of low ERK5 activation in H2122 and
H157 non-small cell lung cancer cells in comparison
with high level of ERK1/2 activation [44]. Based on
these findings from the present study in non-malignant
lung cells, investigation on the distinct role of ERK5 in
regulating EMT and invasion and metastasis in malignant
transformed lung cancer cells is ongoing.
As the proto-oncogenic signaling, MAPKs
pathways are generally thought to promote cancer
development; while differential biological functions may
exist for individual MAPK pathways. Among MAPKs
family, ERK5 is twice the size of other members. The
N-terminal half of ERK5 contains the kinase domain
which is similar to that of ERK1/2 and has the TEY
activation motif. Unlike other MAPKs, the C-terminal
region of ERK5 contains a long non-catalytic domain
which has a unique function. Upon activation, ERK5
phosphorylates and activates downstream target
molecules, including transcription factors such as
members of the AP1 proteins. Activation of ERK5
also results in autophosphorylation of the C-terminus,
which alone has the ability to increase transcription
activity. Therefore, ERK5 differs from other ERKs in
possessing transcriptional activation activity. It is able
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to regulate the transcription of downstream molecules
in two ways, i.e., through either the phosphorylation
or the enhancement of the transcription activity of
target molecules [24–27]. Nevertheless, only a small
number of molecules have been identified as the target
genes of ERK5. Notably, it has been found that ERK5
transcriptional regulates gene expression in a tissuespecific manner [45]. In skeletal muscle cells, activation
of ERK5 significantly inhibits TNF-α-mediated NF-κB
activity [35]. In lung microvascularendothelial cell,
activation of ERK5 suppresses HIF1alpha expression
and inhibits angiogenesis [38]. In this study we showed
that TS-mediated pulmonary ERK5 inhibition increased
the activation of AP-1 proteins c-Fos and c-Jun; on the
contrary, overexpressed ERK5 decreased c-Fos and c-Jun
activation, suggesting the negative modulation of ERK5
on AP-1. Evidences have suggested that AP-1 proteins
play key role in EMT regulation by increasing the
expression of master switch EMT-inducing transcription
factors such as Snai1, Slug, Zeb1/2, Twist1/2, and TGFβ,
which in turn transcriptionally increase the expression
of mesenchymal markers Vimentin and N-cadherin, and
suppress the expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin
and ZO-1 etc. In addition, AP-1 can directly regulate
the transcription of mesenchymal and epithelial markers
involved in EMT induction [46–49]. It is noteworthy that
the precise mechanism by which ERK5 regulates AP-1
activation is unknown at present time, and future studies
are warranted to define the underlying mechanism of
pulmonary ERK5 regulation on AP-1 protein.
ERK5 activity is regulated by its phosphorylation
and dephosphorylation status [24–27]. It has been
demonstrated that ERK5 is activated in response
to a variety of stimuli upon phosphorylation by
its upstream kinase MEK 5, which specifically
recognizes the TEY motif in the N-terminal half,
whereas the phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase
PTP-SL (protein tyrosinephosphatase STEP-like) is
able to dephosphorylate ERK5, thereby hindering its
translocation to the nucleus [50]. Further regulation
of ERK5 by post-translational modifications has been
illustrated. A small ubiquitin-like modifier 3 (SUMO3)
protein covalently binds to ERK5 on Lys6 and Lys22
and inhibits its transcriptional promoter activity without
affecting ERK5 phosphorylation [51]. Additionally, it
has been observed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are able
to regulate ERK5 activity. Expression of miR-143 and
miR-145 has been shown to down-regulate levels of
ERK5 [52–53]. Scapoli L et al. has demonstrated that
activation of Src, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is
involved in ERK5 phosphorylation and activation in
murine alveolar epithelial type II cell line caused by
EGF, H2O2 or asbestos treatment for up to 24 hours
[54]. A recent study has shown that Src activation is
involved in tobacco smoke induced EMT in transformed
lung cancer cells with 72 hours treatment [55]. In the
19614

Oncotarget

Quantitative real-time PCR

present study we have showed that tobacco smoke
decreases the level of phosphorylated ERK5 which
negatively regulates EMT in normal human bronchial
epithelial cells with 7 days treatment and in normal
mouse lungs with 12 weeks treatment. It is possible that
Src activation by tobacco smoke may be involved in
the regulation of ERK5 activity and EMT, although the
experimental conditions including in vitro and in vivo
models as well as treatment durations were different
in our study from that of other studies. Other posttranscriptional modifications may also participate in TS
induced regulation of ERK5 activation.
In summary, the present study demonstrates for
the first time that ERK5 negatively regulates TS-induced
pulmonary EMT in both in vitro and in vivo settings.
These novel findings indicate the important role of ERK5
activity in tobacco smoke-related carcinogenesis and
provide a plausible strategy for the search of potential
interventional target of tobacco smoke-associated lung
tumorigenesis.

The levels of E-cadherin, ZO-1, Vimentin,
N-cadherin and GAPDH mRNA in NHBE cells and
mouse lung tissues were determined by qRT-PCR. The
primers used were as follows: E-cadherin, forward
5′-TCGACACCCGATTCAAAGTGG-3′ and reverse
5′-TTCCAGAAACGGAGGCCTGAT-3′; ZO-1, forward
5′- GCAGCCACAACCAATTCATAG-3′ and reverse
5′-GCAGACGATGTTCATAGTTTC-3′;
Vimentin,
forward 5′-CCTTGACATTGAGATTGCCA-3′ and reverse
5′-GTATCAACCAGAGGGAGTGA-3′;
N-cadherin,
forward 5′-ATCAAGTGCCATTAGCCAAG-3′ and
reverse 5′- CTGAGCAGTGAATGTTGTCA -3′; GAPDH,
forward 5′-GCTGCCCAACGCACCGAATA-3′ and
reverse 5′- GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′.

Transfection of ERK5 lentiviral vectors
NHBE cells were stably transfected with lentiviral
vector expressing ERK5 or its negative control vector
according to manufacture’s protocol. Following
transfection, NHBE cells were exposed to CSE for 7 days
and used for experiments.

METHODS
See the supplementary material for further details
concerning methods.

Mice and exposure to TS

Culture and smoke treatment of NHBE cells

Male BALB/c mice were purchased from the Animal
Research Center of Nanjing Medical University. All mice
were maintained and used in accordance with the guidelines
of Animal Care and Welfare Committee of Nanjing
Medical University. Ten mice were exposed to tobacco
smoke in a smoking apparatus with target concentration
of total particulate matter (TPM) of 85 mg/m3,
or exposed to filtered air. Animals were exposed for
6 hours daily for 12 consecutive weeks. After the last
exposure, mice were sacrificed and lung tissues were
isolated for analysis.

Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells
were purchased from XiangYa Central Experiment
Laboratory (Changsha, China) and cultured in RPMI 1640
Medium. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared
daily immediately before use according to the reported
method [56–58]. One filterless Research cigarette (3R4F)
was combusted and used for preparation of 10 ml medium
which was referred to as a 100% CSE solution. NHBE cells
were exposed to various concentrations of CSE for 7d.

Transwell assays

In vivo delivery of ERK 5 lentiviral vector

Migratory and invasive capacities of CSE-treated
NHBE cells were evaluated using Transwell chambers
without or with matrigel, respectively.

In a separate set of animal study, mice were
intratracheally delivered with lentiviral vectors, as
previously described [59–60]. Mice were randomly
divided into four groups (n = 8 per group): filtered air
group; TS-exposed group, mice were exposed to TS;
TS+LV-control group, mice were delivered with lentiviral
negative control vector and exposed to TS; TS+LVERK5 group, mice were delivered with lentiviral vector
expressing ERK5 and exposed to TS. Following the
complection of exposure, mice were sacrificed and lung
tissues were collected for analysis.

Immunofluorescent staining
Immunofluorescent staining was performed to
analyze the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin in
NHBE cells treated with CSE.

Western blot analysis
Proteins were extracted from NHBE cells and
mouse lung tissues. Western blot analyses were performed
for the determination of protein expression levels. For
densitometric analyses, protein bands on the blots were
measured by the use of Eagle Eye II software.
