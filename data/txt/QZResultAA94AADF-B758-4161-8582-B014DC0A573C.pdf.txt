Abstract
Ligand-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) inhibits proliferation in cancer cells
in vitro and in vivo; however, the downstream targets remain
undefined. We report the identification of a peroxisome proliferator response element in the promoter region of the Na+/
H+ transporter gene NHE1, the overexpression of which has
been associated with carcinogenesis. Exposure of breast cancer cells expressing high levels of PPARγ to its natural and
synthetic agonists resulted in downregulation of NHE1 transcription as well as protein expression. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of activated PPARγ on tumor colony-forming
ability was abrogated on overexpression of NHE1, whereas
small interfering RNA–mediated gene silencing of NHE1 significantly increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to growthinhibitory stimuli. Finally, histopathologic analysis of breast
cancer biopsies obtained from patients with type II diabetes
treated with the synthetic agonist rosiglitazone showed significant repression of NHE1 in the tumor tissue. These data provide evidence for tumor-selective downregulation of NHE1 by
activated PPARγ in vitro and in pathologic specimens from
breast cancer patients and could have potential implications
for the judicious use of low doses of PPARγ ligands in combination chemotherapy regimens for an effective therapeutic response. [Cancer Res 2009;69(22):8636–44]

Introduction
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) belongs
to the nuclear receptor superfamily (1). Putative endogenous ligands for the PPARγ receptor include polyunsaturated fatty acids
(2, 3) and the eicosanoids 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15dPGJ2; refs. 2, 3), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (4), and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (4). In addition to their role in lipid and
glucose metabolism, PPARs play a role in cancer development

and represent promising targets for cancer prevention and treatment strategies (5, 6). Activation of PPARγ has been identified as
an approach for inducing differentiation and inhibiting proliferation in a variety of cancers. Breast tissue, in particular, was found
to express PPARγ in amounts greater than those found in normal
breast epithelium (7). Moreover, activation of PPARγ on exposure
to specific ligands was shown to exert antitumor activity through
growth inhibition and cellular differentiation (8–11). Despite these
promising results, the target genes involved in the anticancer activity of PPARγ ligands are still not well understood.
Interestingly, a recent report implicated the pH regulator, NHE1,
in the mechanism(s) underlying tumor cell growth arrest by activated PPARγ (11), a truly intriguing association considering that
the activation of NHE1 is an oncogenic signal necessary for the development and maintenance of the transformed phenotype (12,
13). Supporting this, cancer cells invariably exhibit a strong tendency toward an alkaline intracellular milieu (14, 15). In addition,
tumor cells deficient in NHE1 activity either fail to grow or show
severely retarded growth when implanted in immunodeficient
mice (16, 17). Along similar lines, we recently reported that decrease in NHE1 expression led to tumor cell growth arrest, intracellular acidification, and sensitization to death stimuli (18, 19).
These data support that downregulation of NHE1 could be an avenue in the search for new strategies to induce growth arrest in
cancer cells as well as increase sensitivity to anticancer treatment.
In light of the increased expression of PPARγ in breast cancer
cell lines and its association with acidic intracellular pH, we hypothesized that, in addition to inhibiting NHE1 activity, ligandinduced activation of PPARγ could regulate NHE1 gene expression.
Indeed, our results show that exposure of breast cancer cell lines
expressing high levels of PPARγ to natural (2, 20) or synthetic (20)
ligands of PPARγ significantly inhibited NHE1 gene expression
compared with noncancerous cells or cancer cell lines expressing
low levels of PPARγ. Furthermore, histopathologic analysis of
breast cancer biopsies from patients treated for type 2 diabetes
with the PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone, showed significantly lower
NHE1 protein expression in the tumor tissues.

Figure 2. NHE1 gene expression regulates tumor cell growth. A, MDA-MB-231 cells were cotransfected with either the empty vector pCMV (vector)/pIRES-Hyg or
pCMV-HA-NHE1/pIRES-Hyg. Cells were then treated with 3 μmol/L 15d-PGJ2 for 16 h followed by seeding in 100 mm culture dishes for colony-forming assays
in the hygromycin selection medium. Successful overexpression of NHE1 after 48 h of transfection was determined by Western blot (top). B, MDA-MB-231 cells seeded
on coverslips placed in culture plates were cotransfected with either empty parent plasmid (vector) or pCMV-HA-NHE1 plasmid (NHE1) and green fluorescent
protein (GFP) plasmid. Cells were treated with 3 μmol/L 15d-PGJ2 for 24 h. Green fluorescent protein fluorescence and bright-field images were analyzed with
an Olympus system Fluoview 500 using the Fluoview imaging system.

Determination of tumor clonogenic ability. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
and T47D cells were treated with various concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 for
16 h before they were left to grow for 10 to 15 days with complete medium
and stained with crystal violet. Colony-forming assays with overexpression
of NHE1 were done with MDA-MB-231 cells by cotransfecting 7.5 μg of either NHE1 or the control plasmid and 1 μg of the hygromycin encoding
vector, pIRES-Hyg (Clontech). Further details on the tumor cells colonyforming capacity can be found in Supplementary Data.
DNA and small interfering RNA transfections. DNA was transfected
using CalPhos Mammalian Transfection kit (Clontech) for 15 h before
growth in fresh medium for another 24 h. Cotransfection with the
Renilla plasmid (Clontech) was used to assess transfection efficiency
in dual-luciferase reporter assay. For small interfering RNA–mediated
gene silencing, 21-nucleotide RNAs were chemically synthesized by Qiagen. 5′-GAUAGGUUUCCAUGUGAUC sequence was used to silence
NHE1 gene transcription (Si-NHE1) and 5′-AGCUUCAUAAGGCGCAUGCTT (luciferase gene sequence inverted) sequence was used as
a control (Control Si). Cells were transfected with small interfering
RNA using the CalPhos Mammalian Transfection kit using 200 nmol/L
small interfering RNAs per well in a 6-well plate for 12 h. Gene silencing
was assayed 48 h post-transfection by Western blot analysis of the total
cell lysates.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer's instructions with a
DNase treatment step incorporated into the protocol. Primers and probes
for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, human PPARγ, and
human NHE1 were purchased as kits from Applied Biosystems (Assays-onDemand). Details of the real-time PCR protocol can be found in Supplementary Data.

LightShift Chemiluminescence electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(nonradioactive gel shift assay). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was
applied to untreated and 15d-PGJ2–treated MCF-7 nuclear extracts (5 μg)
prepared using the nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents N-PER kit
(Pierce). For the detailed protocol, refer to Supplementary Data.
Clinical material from breast cancer patients. The study material
comprised 15 cases of mammary carcinoma diagnosed at or referred
to National University Hospital, Singapore, between 2004 and 2006. Tumors were previously classified according to histology and graded according to the Bloom-Richardson system. All 15 cases were invasive
ductal carcinomas, 2 of which were micropapillary type. There were
6 grade 2 tumors and 9 grade 3 tumors. The 15 cases were then categorized into three groups. Patients in group I had diabetes and had
been on rosiglitazone, patients in group II had diabetes and were on
antidiabetic medication but not the thiazolidinedione class, and patients in group III did not have diabetes and were not on any antidiabetic medication.
Immunohistochemistry for NHE1. Immunohistochemical detection of
NHE1 antigen was done on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor
breast tissues. Stained sections were viewed on an Arcturus PixCell II
LCM System. Two pathologists blindly observed each sample and evaluated
positively stained cells. Pictures of stained sections were taken using an
Olympus camera (Model C5050).
Measurement of intracellular pH. Intracellular pH was measured
using the pH-sensitive fluorogenic probe 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester as described previously (18).
Renilla assay for cell viability. Cells were cotransfected Renilla expression plasmid together with either NHE1 or PPARγ expression plasmids in a 1:10 ratio. Control cells received Renilla plasmid together
with appropriate empty vector in the same 1:10 ratio. Forty-eight hours
post-transfection, cells were treated and death sensitivity was assessed
by measuring the Renilla activity using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega). Percent survival was calculated as the Renilla activity of transfected cells incubated with drug treatment divided by the Renilla
activity of transfected cell incubated without drug treatment multiplied
by 100.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was evaluated using
Student's t test. Significance was accepted at P = 0.05. Asterisk indicates
P < 0.05.

PPARγ-Induced NHE1 Repression

Results
Repression of NHE1 protein expression is involved in the inhibition of the growth of tumor cells on PPARγ activation. Recently, we showed that expression of the NHE1 was critical for the
growth of tumor cells (18). In agreement with these previous findings, inhibition of NHE1 expression in the breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-231 efficiently blocked the ability of tumor cells to form
colonies (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similarly, exposure of MCF-7 or
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines to 3 μmol/L 15d-PGJ2 resulted in significant inhibition of long-term colony formation (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Intrigued by the similar effects of PPARγ
activation and repression of NHE1 protein expression on tumor
cells growth, we assessed the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on the expression
of NHE1 in both cell lines. Results show that exposure of MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells to increasing concentrations of 15d-PGJ2
inhibited NHE1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner
that was accompanied with a decrease in intracellular pH (Fig. 1A
and B). To confirm the involvement of PPARγ in the response of
cells to 15d-PGJ2, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were preincubated with the PPARγ antagonist, GW9662 (21), before exposure

to 15d-PGJ 2 and NHE1 protein level was assessed. GW9662
(15 μmol/L) was sufficient to block PPARγ activation, assessed
by transfection with a 3× PPRE-luciferase reporter gene construct,
in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, the presence
of GW9662 blocked the repression of NHE1 protein brought
about by ligand-induced PPARγ activation (Fig. 1A and B). Similarly, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of PPARγ,
PPARγC126A/E127A, prevented the downregulation of NHE1 protein
expression in MCF-7 cells in response to 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 1C). Taken
together, these data indicate that the decrease in NHE1 protein expression could be a critical mediator of 15d-PGJ2–induced inhibition of tumor colony formation. To test this hypothesis further,
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing
the full-length NHE1 gene (22) before being exposed to 15d-PGJ2
and the colony-forming ability and morphology of cells were assessed. It is to be noted that transient transfection with NHE1
did not affect the activation of PPARγ by 15d-PGJ 2 (data not
shown). To assess the effect of 15d-PGJ 2 on cell morphology
MDA-MB-231 cells were cotransfected with a construct encoding
for the green fluorescent protein in addition to NHE1 or the empty

vector for monitoring the effect on NHE1-transfected cells only
(green fluorescent cells). For the colony-forming assay, cells were
cotransfected with a vector encoding for hygromycin resistance
and selection for NHE1-transfected cells was achieved by the addition of hygromycin in the culture medium. Results show that overexpression of NHE1 afforded by transfection with NHE1 encoding
plasmid prevented the effect of 15d-PGJ2 (compared with empty
vector transfected cells) on cell morphology as well as long-term
colony formation in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2A and B). Cells that
overexpressed NHE1 maintained a viable morphology, whereas
cells exposed to 15d-PGJ2 showed a lot of vacuoles (Fig. 2B) that
correlated with the absence of colony formation in the presence of
the PPARγ agonist (Fig. 2A). Vacuole formation and inhibition of
colony formation were both prevented on overexpression of NHE1
(Fig. 2A and B).
Activated PPARγ binds to the PPRE motif at the 5′-proximal
promoter region of the human NHE1 promoter. Interestingly, a
putative PPRE with an AGGTCAnnAGTTCG motif in the 5′-proximal region of the human NHE1 gene promoter (nucleotides −977
to −990 with respect to the TATA box; accession number L25272)
corresponding to a nonconsensus DR2 element was found. This
motif is within a primate-specific Alu element, in a cluster of hexamers half-sites recognized by various nuclear receptors, termed as
Alu receptor response element (refs. 23–25; Supplementary Fig. S3).
To verify that activated PPARγ could bind to this motif, nuclear
extract was prepared from MCF-7 cells exposed to 3 μmol/L
15d-PGJ2 (2, 20), and biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide
containing the PPRE site within the NHE1 promoter was used as a
probe. Some basal PPARγ binding (retarded complex) could be detected in nuclear extract from untreated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A,
lane 2); however, the intensity of the retarded complex increased
significantly in nuclear extract from cells incubated with 15dPGJ2 (Fig. 3A, lane 3,). The PPRE binding of activated PPARγ
could be inhibited by either nonbiotinylated oligonucleotides

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (22). November 15, 2009

(Fig. 3A, lane 4) or the presence of anti-PPARγ antibody that
blocks the formation of the DNA/PPARγ complex (ref. 23; Fig.
3A, lane 5).
Activation of PPARγ decreases NHE1 promoter activity and
mRNA expression. To assess the effect of PPARγ activation on
NHE1 promoter activity, MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were transfected with a CAT reporter plasmid containing either the full-length
human NHE1 promoter construct (−1374/+16; NHE1−1374/+16), a
5′-deletion construct of the human NHE1 promoter in which the
PPRE is absent (−850/+16; NHE1ΔPPRE), or a full-length mouse
NHE1 promoter. The mouse NHE1 promoter was used because
the putative PPRE motif present in the human NHE1 promoter
is not found within the 1.1-kb mouse NHE1 promoter sequence
(data not shown). Data show that exposure of transfected MCF-7
cells to 15d-PGJ2 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the promoter activity of the human NHE1−1374/+16 construct, whereas no
significant decrease was observed in the NHE1ΔPPRE construct or
the 1.1-kb mouse NHE1 promoter (Fig. 3B). These results indicate
that the 15d-PGJ2–induced downregulation of NHE1 promoter activity in MCF-7 cells requires the presence of the PPRE motif and
therefore is linked to the activation of PPARγ. To corroborate this
result with the induction of mRNA expression, MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells were preincubated with the PPARγ antagonist,
GW9662 (21), before exposure to 15d-PGJ2, and NHE1 mRNA was
assessed. The presence of GW9662 blocked the repression of NHE1
mRNA level brought about by ligand-induced PPARγ activation
(Fig. 3C and D).
Ligand-induced inhibition of NHE1 expression is a function
of PPARγ expression. To assess if the inhibition of NHE1
expression by 15d-PGJ2 was a function of PPARγ expression, we
assessed the mRNA level as well as the activity of PPARγ (induced
by 3 μmol/L 15d-PGJ2) in three breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7,
MDA-MB-231, and T47D) and one human normal mammary epithelial cell line (HTB125). The level of PPARγ mRNA in the three

PPARγ-Induced NHE1 Repression

tumor cell lines was significantly higher than the normal mammary cell line (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Furthermore, within the tumor
cell lines, the level of PPARγ mRNA was in the order of MDA-MB231 > MCF-7 > T47D, which mirror-imaged their respective ligandinduced PPARγ activity (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Similar to the
level of PPARγ mRNA expression, 15d-PGJ2–induced PPARγ activity was hardly detected in the normal mammary HTB125 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). It is noteworthy that PPARγ mRNA
expression level and activity in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells correlated well with the level of NHE1 suppression obtained with 15dPGJ2 (as shown in Fig. 1). Corroborating these data, the inhibitory
effect of 15d-PGJ2–induced PPARγ activation on NHE1 expression
was significantly less pronounced in T47D cells that express low levels of PPARγ activity (Fig. 4A), whereas HTB125 normal mammary
cells were completely refractory to the repressive effect of 15d-PGJ2
on NHE1 expression (Fig. 4B). However, T47D and HTB125 cells became responsive to 15d-PGJ2 in terms of both an increase in PPARγ
activity and an inhibition of NHE1 expression (Fig. 4A and B) on
transfection with a plasmid encoding murine PPARγ.
Thiazolidinedione ligands of PPARγ downregulate NHE1
gene expression. In addition to the endogenous PPARγ agonist
15d-PGJ2, several synthetic PPARγ ligands are already in clinical

use for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (20). Different concentrations of each of these ligands were tested for their effect on PPARγ
activity in MCF-7 cells transfected with the PPARγ reporter gene
construct. All three synthetic ligands induced strong activation of
PPARγ albeit at different concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S5A)
that was inhibited by preincubation of the cells with GW9662.
More importantly, all three agents induced a significant decrease
in NHE1 promoter activity in cells transiently transfected with the
full-length promoter construct (NHE1−1374/+16) but not in those expressing the NHE1ΔPPRE (Fig. 5A). Similar effect was observed at
the protein level with all three synthetic ligands significantly downregulating NHE1 mRNA and protein expression that could be rescued in the presence of the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (Fig. 5B–D).
Interestingly, the morphology of MCF-7 cells exposed to ciglitazone, troglitazone, or rosiglitazone resemble the one described in
Fig. 1B on exposure to 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 5B–D).
NHE1 expression is downregulated in breast cancer tissues
from diabetic patients treated with rosiglitazone. To provide a
physiologic relevance to the finding that activation of PPARγ by
endogenous or synthetic ligands induced a decrease in NHE1 expression in breast cancer cell lines, we exploited the clinical use of
synthetic PPARγ ligands for the management of type 2 diabetes

Tissue sections were incubated with mouse monoclonal NHE1 antibody. Positively stained cells were evaluated using the following intensity categories: 0 (no staining),
1+ (weak but detectable staining), 2+ (moderately intense staining), and 3+ (very intense staining). Tumor grade indicated as intraductal carcinoma (IDC) grade.

mellitus. To that end, we compared the expression of NHE1 in
breast cancer tissues of diabetic patients treated with PPARγ ligand (rosiglitazone) versus breast cancer patients who did not
receive rosiglitazone (but other antidiabetic drugs) for their diabetic condition and/or nondiabetic patients with breast cancer. A total of 15 cases of carcinoma of the breast (intraductal carcinoma
grades 2-3) with available paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were
identified for the periods 2004 and 2006 from the pathology files
of the Department of Pathology, National University of Singapore.
These cases were divided into three groups: group I, diabetic breast
cancer patients treated with rosiglitazone; group II, diabetic breast
cancer patients treated with other antidiabetic drugs; and group
III, nondiabetic breast cancer patients. Immunohistochemical

analysis showed that the expression of NHE1 in clinical tissues corroborated our findings in breast cancer cell lines on the repressive
effect of PPARγ activation on NHE1 expression; 3 of 4 patients in
group I (diabetics on rosiglitazone) showed reduced levels of NHE1
expression compared with the tumors of all patients from the
other two groups. Note that the intraductal carcinoma grade at
diagnosis was similar within the different groups (Supplementary
Table S1). A representative histopathology specimen stained for
NHE1 expression from each group is shown in Fig. 6. In addition,
we show that overexpression of NHE1 abrogated the chemosensitizing effect of PPARγ activation on MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6B
and C). Alternatively, small interfering RNA–mediated gene silencing of NHE1 significantly increased the sensitivity of MCF-7 and

PPARγ-Induced NHE1 Repression

MDA-MB-231 cells to paclitaxel and daunorubicine (Supplementary Fig. 6SA and B).

Discussion
The present study presents evidence supporting a relationship
between two genes reported to be associated with carcinogenesis,
PPARγ (5, 26–30) and NHE1 (11, 17, 31–36). Firstly, exposure of
breast cancer cells to PPARγ agonists (endogenous as well as synthetic) specifically downregulated NHE1 expression in cells overexpressing PPARγ; secondly, a functional PPRE sequence was
identified in the 5′-proximal promoter region of the human
NHE1 gene. The repressive effect of ligand-induced PPARγ activation on NHE1 promoter activity was confirmed by the inhibition of
this activity in the presence of the PPARγ antagonist GW9662.
As a first step to determining the pathway involved in the downregulation of NHE1 gene expression by activation of PPARγ, the 5′proximal promoter region was examined for a potential PPRE. A
putative PPRE in the human NHE1 promoter located at nucleotide
−977 to −990 with respect to the TATA box (accession number
L25272) was identified.
Interestingly, the PPRE found in the NHE1 promoter region is
located within a primate-specific Alu element (37). An alignment
AluRRE of the human NHE1 with that of human MPO gene showed
considerable sequence identity (data not shown). Incidentally, it
has been reported that the human MPO gene is regulated by
PPARγ (23). The AGGTCAnnAGTTCG motif found in the NHE1
promoter corresponds to a nonconsensus DR2 element not only
recognized by PPAR but also recognized by retinoic acid receptors
functioning as retinoic acid response elements. This suggests that,
in addition to respond to PPARγ the PPRE motif found in the
NHE1 promoter may respond to retinoids.
The inhibition of target genes by PPARγ involves either the
transrepression (negative cross-talk) of activating transcription
factors (e.g., NF-κB and activator protein-1; refs. 38, 39) or the sequestration of limiting amounts of coactivator molecules such as
CBP (40). Alternatively, repression of gene transcription by PPARγ
activation could be due to the recruitment of corepressors, NCoR
and SMRT, in a promoter-specific manner (41). In this regard, recruitment of sumolylated PPARγ was recently shown to downregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase gene transcription in
response to PPARγ ligands (42). As for the mechanism underlying
PPARγ-mediated repression of NHE1, our results show that PPARγ
binds to a PPRE sequence on the NHE1 promoter. This supports
that transrepression may not be the mechanism involved in the
inhibition of gene transcription by PPARγ and a mechanism involving corepressors may be more likely to explain the inhibition
of NHE1 expression by PPARγ ligands.
The decrease in NHE1 expression by PPARγ ligands was shown
in breast cancer cell lines as well as in breast tissue of cancer patients incidentally treated with PPARγ agonists because of a type 2
diabetes mellitus. Although our data on clinical samples may not
be statistically significant due to the low number of cases collected,

we believe that these data support that downregulation of NHE1 expression is achievable in vivo on treatment with thiazolidinedione.
Moreover, the inhibition of NHE1 expression on activation of PPARγ
correlated with the level of PPARγ expression. Normal cells or tumor
cells expressing low levels of PPARγ only became responsive following transfection with a plasmid encoding for a mouse PPARγ. These
data support that decrease in NHE1 expression can be specifically
induced in tumor cells overexpressing PPARγ, leaving normal cells
unaffected. In light of the recent study showing that an antisense
therapy targeting NHE1 gene in gastric cancer decreased invasive
capacity, and loss of cloning efficiency, and tumorigenicity in nude
mice (43), the repressive effect of PPARγ activation on NHE1 expression presents a window of opportunity for exploiting PPARγ agonists for selectively tailoring the expression of NHE1 to achieve a
favorable therapeutic response. In addition, synergy between rosiglitazone and platinum-based drugs in several different cancers both
in vitro and using transplantable and chemically induced “spontaneous” tumor models was recently reported (44, 45). Pertinent to this,
we have shown previously that decreasing NHE1 expression sensitizes tumor cells to anticancer drugs (18) and Supplementary
Fig. S6A and B.
In conclusion, our data provide evidence for a tumor-selective
effect of PPARγ activation on downregulation of NHE1 expression
in vitro and in vivo. In light of these data and our previously published experiments on the sensitization of tumor cells to anticancer drugs by a decrease in NHE1 expression, we surmise that,
despite the current controversy surrounding the use of the rosiglitazone, intelligent use of PPARγ agonists singly or in combination
chemotherapy for tumors such as breast cancer could be a promising novel therapeutic strategy.
