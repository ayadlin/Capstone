Abstract
Ral-binding protein 1 (RALBP1) is a stress-responsive and
stress-protective multispecific transporter of glutathione
conjugates (GS-E) and xenobiotic toxins. It is frequently
overexpressed in malignant cells and plays a prominent
antiapoptotic role selectively in cancer cells through its ability
to control cellular concentration of proapoptotic oxidized
lipid byproducts. In the absence of chemotherapy, depletion
or inhibition of RALBP1 causes regression of syngeneic mouse
B16 melanoma. Because RALBP1 transports anthracycline and
Vinca alkaloid drugs, as well as GS-E, and because it confers
resistance to these drugs, we proposed that depletion or
inhibition of RALBP1 should cause regression of human solid
tumors that overexpress RALBP1 and augment chemotherapy
efficacy. Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H358 and H520
and colon SW480 cell lines were used. Cytotoxic synergy
between anti-RALBP1 immunoglobulin G (IgG), cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) [CDDP], and vinorelbine was examined
in cell culture and xenografts of NSCLC cells. Effects of
RALBP1 depletion by antisense were examined in xenografts
of NSCLC H358, NSCLC H520, and colon SW480 cells. RALBP1
depletion by phosphorothioate antisense was confirmed and
was associated with rapid, complete, and sustained remissions
in established s.c. human lung and colon xenografts. RALBP1
inhibition by anti-RALBP1 IgG was equally as effective as
antisense and enhanced CDDP-vinorelbine in lung cancer
xenografts. These studies show that RALBP1 is a transporter
that serves as a key effector function in cancer cell survival
and is a valid target for cancer therapy, and confirm that
inhibitory modulation of RALBP1 transport activity at the cell
surface is sufficient for antitumor effects. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The human Ral-binding protein 1 (RALBP1) functions as an
antiapoptotic and stress-protective protein that prevents cellular
accumulation of toxic metabolites of lipid oxidation products by
catalyzing ATP-dependent transport of reduced glutathione (GSH)electrophile conjugates (GS-E) from cells (1–9). Studies in RALBP1
knockout mice have shown 2- to 7-fold increased accumulation of
lipid hydroperoxides, aldehydes, and alkenals in tissues as a

consequence of RALBP1 loss (9). This is accompanied by >80% loss
of total transport activity for GS-E as well as anthracycline; this loss
translates into an order of magnitude greater sensitivity to
xenobiotic toxins including natural product chemotherapy drugs,
which are directly transported by RALBP1, as well as alkylating
agents and platinum-coordinates that are metabolized to GS-E.
Because GS-E formed downstream of lipid peroxidation are
common toxins formed from both chemical and radiant stress,
RALBP1 loss also confers dramatic sensitivity to apoptosis caused
by radiant stressors, which can induce lipid peroxidation, including
heat, UV, and ionizing radiation (9–11). As predicted by studies in
knockout animals, augmenting RALBP1 in cell culture confers
resistance to anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids, mitomycins, alkylating agents, platinum coordinates, hydrogen peroxide, alkenals, UV
light, heat, and X-irradiation (9–11). In animal models, supplementing RALBP1 increased survival time nearly 3-fold after lethal
irradiation with 500 cGy (9). The central role of RALBP1 function as
a stress-protective antiapoptotic protein is also reflected in the
number of crucial stress signaling proteins found in complexes
with RALBP1, including protein kinase C (PKC)-a, cdc2, Ras-R,
cdc42, RalA, heat shock protein 70, heat shock protein 90, Hsf-1,
POB1, AP2 clathrin adaptor, and epsin (4). That RALBP1 provides
an essential effector function regulated by these signaling
molecules is supported by recent studies showing that activation
or depletion of PKCa has no effect on cell growth in mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from RALBP1 / mice (12, 13).
Protection from stress-mediated apoptosis is essential for cancer
cells, which often have to survive under very adverse conditions.
RALBP1 expression is found to be increased in a number of
malignant cells by gene expression array studies.4 Depleting or
inhibiting RALBP1 causes apoptosis in cultured cells from a variety
of human solid and hematologic malignancies including non–
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer, melanoma,
ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, myeloid leukemia,
and lymphoma (14). The relatively greater sensitivity to apoptosis
on RALBP1 depletion in malignant as compared with nonmalignant cells in culture is also reflected in the B16 mouse melanoma
model, where complete tumor regression occurs after a single i.p.
dose of R508 antisense targeted to specifically deplete RALBP1 (14).
These results naturally raised the questions of whether these
observations would be applicable to human malignancy and
whether RALBP1 depletion or inhibition could augment the
efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Present studies address these
questions in cell culture and nude mouse xenografts of human lung
and colon cancer cell lines. We used the lung and colon cancer
xenograft models to test whether RALBP1 depletion by antisense
would cause cancer regression and used the lung cancer model in

cell culture and xenograft to test whether inhibition of RALBP1 by
anti-RALBP1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) would enhance the efficacy
of cisplatin (a GS-E-forming drug) and vinorelbine (a Vinca alkaloid
known to be transported by RALBP1). This chemotherapy
combination was felt particularly suited because it is known to
be synergistic and is the first combination chemotherapy to be
shown to prolong survival in an adjuvant setting.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. RPMI 1640 and DMEM, PBS, penicillin/streptomycin solution,
fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA, and trypan blue were purchased
from Life Technologies, Inc. Keratinocyte serum-free medium and EGM-2
bullet kit medium were purchased from Cambrex BioScience. DMSO, G418
(geneticin), and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were obtained from Sigma. Vinorelbine (Navelbine) and
doxorubicin were obtained from GensiaSicor Pharmaceutical and Adria
Laboratories, respectively. 3H-Vinorelbine was purchased from ViTrax. cisDiammine-dichloroplatinum (II) [CDDP] was procured from Bristol-Meyers
Squibb. Reagents for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories.
Sources of other reagents and polyclonal rabbit anti-human rec-RALBP1
antibodies and protocol for purification of IgG were the same as previously
described (2). Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) Fluorescence Detection kit was purchased from
Promega.
Cell lines and cultures. Human lung cancer cell lines H520 (squamous
cell carcinoma), H358 (Bronchio alveolar), H2347 (adenocarcinoma), and
colon cancer cell line SW480 were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. Human lung bronchioepithelial cells (HLBEC), human umbilical
vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), and human aortic vascular smooth
muscle cells (HAVSMC) were kindly provided by Drs. John D. Minna and
Fiemu Nwariaku (University of Texas Southwestern Medical center, Dallas,
TX), respectively. All cells were cultured at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 in the appropriate medium: RPMI 1640 (H358, H520, H2347, and
SW480), DMEM (HAVSMC), keratinocyte serum-free medium (HLBEC), and
EGM-2 bullet kit (HUVEC) medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heatinactivated FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/L
glucose, and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate.
Transfection of RALBP1 in NSCLC cells. H358 (NSCLC) were
transfected with the eukaryotic expression vector alone (pcDNA3.1) or
with pcDNA3.1-RALBP1 using Effectene Transfection Reagent kit (Qiagen).
Expression of RALBP1 mRNA was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR
analysis. The RNA was prepared with RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA was
quantified and purity was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 and
280 nm. RALBP1 gene-specific primers [334–353 bp (upstream primer) and
1,209–1,228 bp (downstream primer)] were used for RT-PCR. Ready-to-go
RT-PCR beads were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Amersham Biosciences). Levels of RALBP1 protein in control and
transfected clones were measured by immunoassay using anti-RALBP1
IgG. Aliquots of crude detergent membrane fraction of cells containing
200 Ag protein were applied to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were
done as previously described (8).
Anti-RALBP1 antibodies. We have raised and purified polyclonal rabbit
anti-human RALBP1 IgG (also referred to previously as anti-RLIP76 IgG)
using procedures previously described (2) and aliquots were stored at
86jC. All reagents for the preparation of antibodies and storage were
filtered through 0.22-Am filters and handled under laminar flow hoods in a
sterile manner. Aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal cultures of random aliquots
were done at 2-month intervals. The integrity and purity of the antibodies
were consistently checked by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis against
anti-IgG antibodies during these studies. Protein A affinity-purified
immunoglobulin fraction obtained from the preimmune serum was used
as control. Anti-RALBP1 IgG used in these experiments was previously
shown by Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion assay to be non–crossreactive with any other proteins including P-glycoprotein or MRP1 (4, 5).

Drug sensitivity assay. Cell density measurements were done with a
hemocytometer to count reproductive cells resistant to staining with trypan
blue. Approximately 2  104 cells were plated into each well of a 96-well
flat-bottomed microtiter plate 24 h before addition of medium containing
varying concentrations of either preimmune serum or anti-RALBP1 IgG
(0–100 Ag/mL final concentration). After 24-h incubation, 40-AL aliquots of
drug (vinorelbine or CDDP and both; concentrations ranging from 1 to
10,000 nm) were then added to eight replicate wells to assess the IC50 of
drug, which is defined as the concentration at which formazan was reduced
by 50%. After 96-h incubation, 20 AL of 5 mg/mL MTT were introduced to
each well and incubated for 2 h of exposure. The plates were centrifuged
and medium was decanted. Cells were subsequently dissolved in 100-AL
DMSO with gentle shaking for 2 h at room temperature, followed by
measurement of absorbance at 570 nm (15).
Chou-Talalay median effect analysis of synergy. The Chou-Talalay
method of determination of synergy (16) is based on measurement of IC50
values for each drug alone and in combinations. The Calcusyn software
package, which uses an algorithm that takes into account the cytotoxicity as
well as dose-effect curves for each chemotherapy drug and the antibodies,
was used. Analysis of synergy was done by determining the combination
index from the isobologram equation for two drugs or three drugs.
Combination index < 1, combination index = 1, and combination index >1
correspond to synergy, additivity, and antagonism, respectively.
Efflux studies of 3H-vinorelbine in the presence of CDDP and antiRALBP1 IgG. The NSCLC (H358) cells were harvested and washed with
PBS. Aliquots containing 5  106 cells were inoculated into fresh medium.
Anti-RALBP1 IgG (40 Ag/mL final concentration) alone or in combination
with CDDP (1 Amol/L final concentration) was added to the cells in
microcentrifuge tubes and incubated at 37jC for 60 min in a CO2 incubator.
The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 90-AL medium. 3H-Vinorelbine
(100 nmol/L; specific activity, 4,080 cpm/pmol) was then added to the
medium. The cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37jC. Cells were
centrifuged at 300  g for 5 min, after which the supernatant was removed
completely and the cell pellet washed with PBS twice. The pellet was
immediately resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. Fifty-microliter aliquots of clear
supernatant were removed every 60 s for radioactivity counting for 15 min.
The back-added curves of cellular residual vinorelbine versus time were
constructed as previously described (8, 17).
Immunohistochemical analysis. Buffered formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue sections (5 Am) were deparaffinized and rehydrated by
passage through xylene and graded ethanol solutions. Slides were then
treated with 3% hydrogen peroxidase with 0.03% sodium azide in PBS for
10 min, followed by microwave antigen retrieval at 100jC for 10 min in
DAKO Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO Corp.) in an H2800 Microwave
Processor (Energy Beam Sciences, Inc.). Slides were incubated in 0.05%
casein (Sigma)/0.05% Tween 20/PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific protein
binding. Rabbit anti-human RALBP1 IgG was applied to sections at a 1:200
dilution for 60 min. Universal Negative Control for rabbit primary
antibodies (DAKO) was used as negative control. Envision+R system
labeled polymer-horseradish peroxidase antirabbit was used for detection
and color was developed with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAKO). Slides were
counterstained with Mayer’s modified hematoxylin (Poly Scientific) before
mounting and viewed under an Olympus BX51 microscope; images were
recorded by a DP70 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.).
Animal model. Hsd: athymic nude nu/nu mice were obtained from
Harlan. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with a
protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Fifty-one 14-week-old mice were divided into 17 groups of 3 animals
(treated with PBS, preimmune IgG, scrambled antisense DNA, anti-RALBP1
IgG, R508, CDDP, vinorelbine, and with various combinations). Thirty-three
animals were injected with 2  106 H358 NSCLC, nine animals were injected
with 2  106 H520 NSCLC, and nine animals were injected s.c. with 2  106
SW480 colon cancer cell suspensions in 100 AL of PBS. Animals were
examined daily for signs of tumor growth. Treatment was administered
when the tumor surface area exceeded 45 mm2 (days 22 and 25 for lung and
colon cells, respectively). Treatment consisted of 200 Ag anti-RALBP1 IgG,
R508, 6 Ag vinorelbine, 30 Ag CDDP, 6 Ag vinorelbine + 30 Ag CDDP, 200 Ag

Nude mice bearing lung cancer tumors (size f50 mm2) were injected i.p.

mL of penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin, minced in 2 mL of
trypsin/EDTA, and incubated at 37jC for 30 min. After further disruption
by repeated aspiration in a 1-mL syringe, cells were diluted in RPMI 1640
containing 10% FBS. The cells were allowed to attach to coverslips by
overnight incubation in RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated
FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/L glucose, and 1.5 g/L
sodium bicarbonate at 37jC in a CO2 incubator. Effect of depletion of
RALBP1 by R-508 on immunohistochemistry using anti-RALBP1 IgG and
apoptosis by TUNEL assay were done according to the method previously
described (18, 19).

Results
Antineoplastic effects of RALBP1 depletion by phosphorothioate antisense DNA. We have previously shown that RALBP1
depletion by the phosphorothioate antisense R508 (directed against
nucleotides 508–528 of RALBP1) induces apoptosis in cultured
human malignant cells, including melanoma, lung cancer, prostate
cancer, and ovarian cancer, and causes complete regression of
established s.c. murine B16 melanoma (14). To determine whether
these findings are applicable to human cancer cell lines, we
compared the cytotoxic activity of R508 between immortalized
nonmalignant cells, including HLBEC, HUVEC, and HAVSMC cells,
versus malignant cell lines, including human lung, colon, ovary, and
melanoma and mouse melanoma (Table 1). The malignant cells
were significantly more susceptible than nonmalignant cells to the
cytotoxicity of R508. Encouraged by these results, we subsequently
tested the ability of R508 to cause regression of xenografts of
NSCLC H358, NSCLC H520, and colon cancer SW480 cell lines. The
ability of R508 to deplete RALBP1 in mouse tissues was first
examined. Non–tumor-bearing animals injected with a single 200Ag dose of R508 were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, and 14 days later and
crude homogenate fractions of liver, kidney, lung, and brain were
assayed for RALBP1 protein by ELISA (18) and for total protein by
Bradford assay. RLIP76 represented a remarkably constant 0.4 F
0.05% of total extractable protein in all four organs (Fig. 1A). This
amount is comparable to the f0.6% previously reported in lung
and other cancer cells (14, 18). Within 24 h of R508 treatment,
RALBP1 was depleted to <0.01% of the total extractable protein and
a slow partial recovery was seen within a 14-day period of these
experiments. Immunohistochemical studies for RALBP1 expression
further confirmed ELISA findings. Representative findings from
immunohistochemistry in kidney tissue are presented (Fig. 1B).
These results indicated that the R508 regimen used during the
present studies caused RALBP1 depletion in tissues.
Tumor-bearing animals with established s.c. implanted tumors
>45 mm2 were treated with 200 Ag of R508 administered on days 1
and 15 by i.p. injection. R508-treated animals had rapid and
dramatic reductions in tumors until disappearance before day 20;
the remarkable contrast in the outcome of tumors in animals
treated with R508 versus scrambled phosphorothioate was clearly
evident for two lung cancer cell lines and one colon cancer cell line
(Fig. 1C–E). The R508-treated mice with lung or colon cancer are

NOTE: Cells were treated with R508 using Maxfect transfection
reagent (Molecula, Inc.). Cell survival was measured by MTT
cytotoxicity assay 48 h after treatment (18). The final concentration
of R508 in a 96-well plate was 5, 10, and 50 Ag/mL. The values are
presented as mean F SD from two separate determinations with eight
replicates each (n = 16).

still alive at >10 months without evidence of recurrence (see
Supplementary data). Weight gain in R508 animals was comparable
to non–tumor-bearing controls, and no overt toxicity was evident,
perhaps the clearest demonstration of sufficiently cancer-specific
apoptotic activity of R508 in the present model system. To examine
whether this depletion also occurred in the tumor and to
determine whether the resultant disappearance of tumor was
due to triggering of apoptosis, we excised tumors from flanks of
animals 48 h after i.p. dosing of R508 and examined the cells for the
presence of RALBP1 protein by immunohistochemistry and for the
occurrence of apoptosis by TUNEL stain. As shown in Fig. 1F,
RALBP1 is immunohistochemically detectable in the tumor from
animals treated with the scrambled antisense, in which there is
also little or no apoptosis identified by TUNEL assay. This is in
stark contrast with R508, which nearly completely depleted
RALBP1 and caused extensive apoptosis (Fig. 1F).
Antineoplastic effects of RALBP1 inhibition, CDDP, and
vinorelbine. The above studies establish that RALBP1 depletion
causes regression of lung and colon cancer xenografts but do not
distinguish between two possible models of RALBP1 function: that
the transport activity of RALBP1 is the key element necessary for
its protective effects or that, as proposed by others, it functions
through signaling interactions with antiapoptotic signaling proteins distinct from its transport activity. Because R508 depletes
virtually all cytosolic and membrane-associated RALBP1, the
antineoplastic effect would be the same with either of the two
models. We reasoned that an experimental approach aimed at
specifically inhibiting transport activity of RALBP1 without
affecting total cellular RALBP1 would be necessary to distinguish
between the two models. We have previously shown that a cellsurface epitope of RALBP1 (amino acids 171–185) is recognized by
anti-RALBP1 IgG as well as by polyclonal antibodies generated

against the specified peptide, and that this recognition is abrogated
on sole expression of mutant RALBP1 lacking this peptide (19).
Coating live cells with either antibody causes rapid increase in
cellular content of transported substrates including doxorubicin
and 4-hydroxynonenal-glutathione conjugate (4HNE-SG; refs. 7, 10,
11), whereas total RALBP1 protein content remains unchanged.
These findings predict that anti-RALBP1 IgG should function with
at least equal antitumor efficacy as the antisense if the antiapoptotic activity of RALBP1 is dependent on its transport activity.
The specificity of the present anti-RALBP1 IgG was clearly
apparent from studies showing that the antibody recognizes only
two peptides, 95 and 38 kDa, in crude homogenate of mouse heart
tissue from wild-type mouse, and no peptides were recognized in
the similarly prepared homogenate from the RALBP1 / animal,
which by definition lacks RALBP1. The striking lack of any
recognized band in the RALBP1 / could not be overcome by
increasing protein loaded per well from 150 to 400 Ag (Fig. 2A). The

95-kDa band represents intact RALBP1, confirmed by NH2-terminal
sequence analyses, and the 38-kDa band is an internal fragment
beginning at residue Ser424. These results showed essentially
absolute specificity of these antibodies in the mouse model. To
test this further in the human cells, we similarly applied crude
protein samples (200 Ag/well) from three lung cancer, one colon
cancer, and two immortalized nonmalignant cell lines (Fig. 2B). As
previously seen (5), only the 95- and 67-kDa bands are seen in these
cells; both bands were transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane
and shown by amino acid NH2-terminal sequencing to be the NH2terminal and the internal peptide beginning at residue Met225
characteristic for cultured cell lines (5), whereas the 95- and 38-kDa
bands are always observed in RALBP1 purified from tissues (2, 9).
These differences may be related to both differential posttranslational modifications, as well as to known splice variants of RALBP1
(5). Lack of any significant extraneous bands in these studies
attests to the relative specificity of these antibodies in human

sacrificed at 24 h, 48 h, 96 h, and 2 wks after one dose of R508 (200 Ag in 100 AL of PBS), i.p. Control groups were treated with 200 Ag of scrambled antisense
phosphorothioate in 100 AL of PBS (three animals per group). Liver, lung, kidney, and brain tissues were removed from animals at each time point. RALBP1 protein content
was measured in homogenates prepared from each tissue by an ELISA assay using anti-RALBP1 IgG as previously described by us for cultured cells (18). B, time course
of RALBP1 depletion in renal tissue by immunohistochemistry. Studies were done on kidney tissue at each time point with anti-RALBP1 IgG as a primary antibody
using Mayer’s modified hematoxylin counterstaining as previously described (9). C to E, antineoplastic effect of RALBP1 depletion in NSCLC H358, H520, and colon
cancer SW480 xenografts. An aliquot of 2  106 H358, H520, or SW480 cells in 100-AL PBS was injected s.c. into one flank of each nu/nu nude mouse (three animals
per group). When tumors reached a cross-sectional area of f45 mm2, animals were randomized into treatment groups as indicated in the figure. Tumors were
measured in two dimensions using calipers. F, effect of depletion of RALBP1 by R-508 on immunohistochemistry and apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Nude mice bearing lung
cancer tumors (size f50 mm2) treated with 200 Ag of either scrambled or RALBP1 R508 were dissected after 48 h and primary cultures from both scrambled- and RLIP76
R-508–treated tumors were prepared. For immunohistochemical localization studies, anti-RALBP1 IgG was used as primary antibody and FITC-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody. Induction of apoptosis is shown by TUNEL assay in which green fluorescence represents apoptotic cells.

systems as well. These results also confirm our previous finding of
the significantly lower content of RALBP1 in the immortalized as
compared with malignant cell lines (14).
The CDDP-vinorelbine combination is highly active in lung
cancer and has been shown by others to be synergistic. A
prediction from our recent studies, showing that RALBP1 can
mediate efflux of vinorelbine, was that the efficacy of the CDDPvinorelbine combination could be enhanced by depleting or
inhibiting RALBP1. This postulate was tested in cell culture by
comparing vinorelbine efflux from wild-type or RALBP1-overexpressing H358 NSCLC cells in the presence of anti-RALBP1 and
CDDP (Fig. 2C). Efflux of 3H-vinorelbine from cells loaded with the
drug was monitored using a modified flow-cell method to quantify
time-dependent loss of drug from cells (17). RALBP1-overexpressing

cells showed faster vinorelbine efflux than the wild-type or empty
vector–transfected cells. Coating cells with anti-RALBP1 IgG
markedly reduced vinorelbine efflux but did not abrogate it.
Addition of CDDP caused further significant decrease in vinorelbine efflux (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that residual
vinorelbine efflux after blocking RALBP1 is likely mediated by
ABC transporters, and that addition of CDDP (with resultant
formation of GS-CDDP conjugates) likely blocked those ABC
transporters known to transport both vinorelbine and GSH
conjugates of CDDP, such as MRP1 and BCRP (20, 21). These
studies confirm that efflux of vinorelbine is augmented by
increasing RALBP1; that it is inhibited partially by anti-RALBP1
IgG; and that this inhibition is more effective in the presence of
cisplatin, a GS-E forming agent.

is shown by Western blot analysis, with application of 150 Ag (lanes 1 and 2, wild-type and knockout homozygous, respectively) and 400 Ag (lanes 3 and 4, wild-type
and knockout homozygous, respectively) of crude membrane fraction to SDS-PAGE (top ) and using anti-RALBP1 IgG as primary antibody and h-actin as internal
control (bottom ). B, antibody specificity in human cells was examined by Western blotting of crude detergent extracts of the membrane fractions of human lung
(H358, H520, and H2347), colon (SW480), HUVEC, and HLBEC cell lines against anti-RALBP1 IgG. The lanes contained 200-Ag proteins and Western blot was
developed with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody and 4-chloro-1-napthol as chromogenic substrate. h-Actin was used
as internal control. W.B., Western blot. C, effects of RALBP1 overexpression, anti-RALBP1 IgG, and CDDP on vinorelbine (VRL ) efflux. H358 wild-type (y),
vector alone–transfected (n), and RALBP1-transfected (E) cells were loaded with 100 nmol/L radiolabeled 3H-vinorelbine and incubated for 60 min; extracellular drug
was washed off with PBS, followed by rapid dilution in drug-free buffer. The cells were divided into three groups: untreated (yellow ), treated with anti-RALBP1
IgG (green ), and treated with anti-RALBP1 IgG and CDDP (brown ). Aliquots of buffer were removed every minute and total residual radioactivity in the dilution
buffer was measured at the end of the study. Efflux studies were done with three replicates in two independent experiments. Points, mean (n = 6). Back-addition curves
of cellular residual vinorelbine versus time were constructed as previously described (8, 17). D, in vitro cytotoxic interactions of CDDP, vinorelbine, and anti-RALBP1

was injected s.c. into one flank of each nu/nu nude mouse (three animals per group). When tumors reached a cross-sectional area of f45 mm2, animals were
randomized into treatment groups as indicated: PBS; preimmune serum; anti-RALBP1 IgG; vinorelbine; CDDP; vinorelbine + CDDP; anti-RALBP1 IgG + CDDP;
anti-RALBP1 IgG + vinorelbine; and anti-RALBP1 IgG + vinorelbine + CDDP. Tumors were measured in two dimensions using calipers.

RALBP1 Targeted Therapy of Lung and Colon Cancer

The cytotoxic effects of these drug-combinations were tested in
three NSCLC cell lines: H520 (squamous cell carcinoma), H358
(bronchioalveolar), and H2347 (adenocarcinoma). Results of one
fixed dose combination are shown (Fig. 2D). The CDDP-vinorelbine
effect was supra-additive, as was the CDDP-vinorelbine-antiRALBP1 IgG effect; vinorelbine-anti-RALBP1 IgG and CDDP-antiRALBP1 IgG were additive or subadditive. Chou-Talalay analyses of
synergy using multiple combinations of dose effects for the three
agents confirmed synergy for combinations CDDP-vinorelbine and
CDDP-vinorelbine-RALBP1 IgG and indicated additive effects for
the vinorelbine-anti-RALBP1 IgG and CDDP-anti-RALBP1 IgG
combinations. The predictions from this in vitro model were
tested in a nude mouse xenograft model using NSCLC H358.
Animals were treated with i.p. injection of 100-AL PBS containing
CDDP (1 mg/kg body weight), vinorelbine (0.2 mg/kg of body
weight), anti-RALBP1 IgG (7 mg/kg of body weight), or combinations when implanted tumor size reached 45 mm2, and repeated
1 and 3 weeks later (Fig. 2E and Supplementary figures). The
CDDP-vinorelbine combination was more effective than either drug
alone with respect to rate of regression. Remarkably, the animals
treated with anti-RALBP1 IgG responded much more quickly than
animals treated with CDDP, vinorelbine, or CDDP-vinorelbine.
Addition of either CDDP or vinorelbine individually to anti-RALBP1
IgG did not result in any increase in the efficacy of the antibody
alone. However, treatment with all three agents caused the most
rapid remission. Whereas the chemotherapy-treated animals all
died of recurrent disease between 72 and 120 days, 8 of 12 animals
receiving any anti-RALBP1 IgG are surviving at >330 days.
These striking results not only confirm the validity of RALBP1 as
a target but also strongly support our model for RALBP1 in which it
functions to protect from stress through its transport activity.
These results also show for the first time that anti-RALBP1 IgG
alone exerts antineoplastic activity in xenograft models of human
NSCLC at least equivalent to that of a fixed combination of CDDP
and vinorelbine. The lack of additional effect of vinorelbine and
CDDP on the effect of anti-RALBP1 IgG alone further suggests that
inhibition of efflux of physiologic GS-E (such as 4HNE-SG) may be
an important mechanism for the apoptotic effects of vinorelbine or
CDDP; i.e., these drugs exert at least some of their apoptotic effect
by competitive inhibition of physiologic ligand transport by
RALBP1. Accumulation of such ligand, GS-HNE, is known to
directly inhibit GSH-linked metabolism of lipid hydroperoxides and
their potent proapoptotic alkenal derivatives, particularly 4HNE. In
context of such a model, it would not be surprising to see no
additional effect of either of these drugs alone when RALBP1 is
inhibited. The increased anti-RALBP1 IgG effect in the presence of
both drugs may be related to the presence of distinct but related/
overlapping sites on RALBP1 for binding GS-E versus natural
product toxins; thus, perhaps the presence of both drugs is more
effective at inhibition of efflux of physiologic ligands (GS-E formed
from lipid hydroperoxides).

Discussion
During present studies, we show that i.p. administration of
RALBP1 antisense or anti-RALBP1 IgG to nude mice leads to
complete and sustained regression of lung (NSCLC) and colon
cancer xenograft tumors. These findings indicate that RALBP1 is a
key survival protein for NSCLC and colon cancer cell, and that its
depletion/inhibition results in regression of human NSCLC and
colon cancer xenografts without any apparent toxicity to animals.

Because both anti-RALBP1 antibodies and R508 antisense DNA
produce similar effects, our findings support the assertion that the
antiapoptotic and stress-protective effects of RALBP1 are primarily
related to its transport activity. RALBP1 is present in cytosol, and
for its transport function, it can also anchor to membrane (19).
Functions attributed to the intracellular RALBP1 (e.g., its signaling
role as a Ral or Ras-R GTPase-activating protein; refs. 22–26) are
least likely to be affected by anti-RALBP1 antibodies that cannot
enter the cells and specifically interact with epitopes on
membrane-anchored RALBP1 to inhibit its transport function. In
case the lack of presence of RALBP1 within cells also contributes to
the observed suppression of tumors due to the cessation of some
or all of its known cellular functions (e.g., involvement in Ral or
Ras-R signaling, endocytosis and mitosis, spindle motor functions,
and the regulation of the expression of heat shock proteins), one
would expect a more tumor-suppressive activity associated with
antisense as compared with anti-RALBP1 IgG. Our findings show
that RALBP1 is a unique anticancer target that is a versatile and
efficient multidrug transporter and an antiapoptosis protein
essential for the survival of cancer cells. Through its ability to
efficiently transport the GSH conjugates of endogenous proapoptotic molecules (e.g., 4HNE), as well as chemotherapeutic drugs, it
provides survival advantage to cancer cells.
Multiple signaling mechanisms seem to operate in parallel under
conditions of oxidative stress to induce apoptosis and to defend
against it (10, 11, 27–29). Free radicals activate cellular stress–
sensitive pathways including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, InB
kinase, nuclear factor nB (NF-nB), and extracellular receptor
kinases (10, 11, 30–32), leading to the production of superoxide
anion radicals by NADPH oxidase (33–35). The availability of
superoxide anion accelerates lipid peroxidation, resulting in
amplification of parallel chemical signaling cascade consisting of
oxidized lipids and their obligatory degradation products. 4HNE is
the most abundant reactive alkenal formed from lipid peroxidation
and is capable of functioning as a toxic endogenous alkylating
agent (29, 36). Lowering cellular 4HNE levels increases proliferation, whereas increasing its concentration triggers differentiation,
apoptosis, and necrosis (37). 4HNE is metabolized primarily to the
glutathione conjugate GS-HNE by glutathione S-transferase (GST),
particularly the a-class isoenzyme A4-4. hGSTA4 directly regulates
cellular 4HNE level (38, 39) such that its overexpression in HLEB3
cells depletes 4HNE and causes a dramatic phenotypic transformation accompanied by loss of Fas; down-regulation of p53, p21,
p16, fibronectin 1, laminin g1, connexin 43, integrin a6, transforming growth factor (TGF)-a, and c-jun; and up-regulation of
protein kinase Ch-2 (PKCh-2), c-myc, cyclin-dependent kinase 2,
and TGF-h (40). These results support the direct involvement
of 4HNE in carcinogenic transformation. The next step in
4HNE metabolism is the aldose-reductase–catalyzed reduction of
GS-HNE to GS-glutathionyl-1, 4-dihydroxynonenol (DHN). Aldosereductase depletion causes disappearance of GS-DHN, accompanied by inhibition of proliferation of the SW480 colon cancer cells
in culture and arrest of colon cancer xenograft growth in vivo. The
mechanism for this effect has been identified as inhibition of
key proliferation signals including Cox-2, PKCh-2, phospholipase
C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, prostaglandin E2, NF-nB, AP1,
interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-g, cyclic AMP, MCP (chemokine),
and inducible nitric oxide synthase (41, 42).
Aldose-reductase regulates the GS-HNE/GS-DHN ratio, but the
absolute cellular concentrations of these and other GS-E are
determined by the ATP-dependent transporters, such as RALBP1.

GS-E transporters include the ABC-proteins MRP1 and BCRP, but
RALBP1 (RLIP76) is the dominant GS-E transporter (9, 43). This is
evident from loss of f80% transport activity for GS-E in RALBP1
homozygous mouse tissues and from sensitivity of these mice to
GS-E–generating stresses including X-irradiation and oxidant
chemicals (9). Acute depletion of RALBP1 by siRNA or antisense
or inhibition of transport by cell-surface epitope–directed antibodies causes apoptosis in cancer cells selectively, sparing
nonmalignant cells (14). Unlike aldose-reductase inhibition, which
causes gradual partial response, RALBP1 depletion or inhibition in
animal models causes rapid, complete, and sustained regression of
malignancy shown here in human xenografts and previously in
syngeneic mouse melanoma (14). The independence of the
apoptotic effect of RALBP1 from either p53 or ras alterations;
greater apoptotic sensitivity of RALBP1 / MEFs to stress despite
constitutively active Akt, c-jun NH2-terminal kinase, AP1, and NFnB;5 and complete loss of PKCa-mediated signaling of proliferation
and drug-resistance (12, 13) further show the central importance of
RALBP1 as an antiapoptotic effector. The efficacy of anti-RALBP1
IgG was superior to either CDDP or vinorelbine alone, highlighting
the importance of RALBP1 as an anticancer target and suggesting
that apoptosis triggered by CDDP or vinorelbine could be mediated

by competitive inhibition of transport of physiologic substrates
such as oxidative metabolism–derived GS-HNE, as specifically
shown previously in transport studies using artificial and cell
membrane–derived liposomes (1). The greater activity of the threedrug combination suggests that, when given together, the two
chemotherapy drugs may be more effective at inhibiting not only
RALBP1 but also other ABC family transporters. That anti-RALBP1
IgG did not completely abrogate vinorelbine efflux and an
increased inhibition was seen when CDDP was present as well
support the results of previous studies in which a significant role of
ABC transporters such as ABCG2 or ABCC1 has been shown in the
transport of vinorelbine as well as GS-CDDP conjugate (20, 21, 43).
In conclusion, present studies show that inhibition or depletion
of RALBP1 exerts antineoplastic effects in colon and lung cancer,
and indicate that GS-E and xenobiotic transporters occupy a very
important position in the hierarchy of stress defense mechanisms
necessary for cancer cell survival.
