BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to characterize the relation between the survival of patients with stage
IIIB/IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pack-years of cigarette smoking (graded according to the American
Joint Committee on Cancer staging system). METHODS: Data were analyzed from patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC
who had completed a prospective smoking questionnaire. The impact of pack-years of cigarette smoking, age, sex,
Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and the presence of weight loss >5% was evaluated on overall survival using
univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Smoking history and clinical data were available for 2010 patients
with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC (1004 women and 1006 men). Approximately 70% of patients (1409 patients) had smoked
>15 pack-years, 13% (270) were former and current smokers who had smoked 15 pack-years, and 16% (331) were
never-smokers (<100 lifetime cigarettes). Never-smokers had a longer median survival compared with former or current smokers (17.8 months vs 11.3 months; log-rank P < .001). Among smokers, patients with a 15 pack-year history
of smoking had a longer median survival than patients who had smoked >15 pack-years (14.6 months vs 10.8 months;
log-rank P ¼ .03). As the number of pack-years increased, the median overall survival decreased (log-rank P < .001).
Multivariate analysis indicated that a history of smoking was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 1.36; P
< .001). CONCLUSIONS: More cigarette smoking, measured in pack-years, was associated with decreased survival after a diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Trials assessing survival in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC should report a

KEYWORDS: nonsmall cell lung cancer, cigarettes, smoking history, pack-years, survival, prognostic factor.

Although cigarette smoking causes the majority of new cases of lung cancer in the United States, greater than 30,000
patients diagnosed with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) each year have never smoked cigarettes. For patients with
NSCLC, a history of smoking cigarettes is a negative prognostic factor.1-16 However, among smokers, a history of cigarette
smoking can range from patients who smoked a few cigarettes a day for a few years to patients who smoked packs of cigarettes daily for decades.
The importance of amount of cigarette smoking history, as measured by pack-years, is clear from our understanding
of the epidemiology of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. Although somatic EGFR mutations are
widely known to be more common in patients with NSCLC who never smoked cigarettes, patients with more limited
smoking histories are more likely to have EGFR mutations than those with heavy smoking histories.17 In fact, the frequency of EGFR mutations is not significantly different between patients with NSCLC who never smoked and those who
smoked cigarettes for up to 15 pack-years.17
Patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations in exon 19 or 21 are reported to
have response rates >70% and prolonged progression-free survival after treatment with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib or erlotinib (graded according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system).18-22 The

presence of EGFR mutations is reported to predict
response to EGFR TKI therapy better than smoking status and may be a positive prognostic factor in patients
with advanced lung adenocarcinoma irrespective of
therapy.18,23
The identification and characterization of prognostic factors for patients with NSCLC is important to allow
comparison of patient populations in clinical trials and to
help guide therapies for some patients. The best prognostic
factor for patients with NSCLC is stage of disease.24
Among patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, positive prognostic factors include Karnofsky performance status (KPS)
80%, absence of significant weight loss (>5%), and
female sex.25,26 To characterize the relation between survival and pack-years of cigarette smoking, we reviewed prospectively collected smoking data, clinical characteristics,
and outcome data for patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients
All patients evaluated by the Thoracic Oncology Service
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)
complete a prospectively administered smoking questionnaire as part of the standard clinical assessment. Using the
smoking questionnaire, the number of pack-years was
determined for patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. This
cohort includes patients with stage IIIB/IV disease at the
time of the initial diagnosis and patients diagnosed with
stage IV NSCLC at the time of recurrent disease after previous surgery or radiation. From the medical record, we
also obtained data regarding sex, race/ethnicity, age, KPS,
and the presence of weight loss >5% within 6 months of
the initial visit. This review of records was done under a
waiver of authorization approved by the MSKCC Institutional Review Board and Privacy Board.
Patients were categorized as never-smokers if they
smoked <100 cigarettes. Former smokers had to have
quit at least 1 year before the visit. Current smokers continued to smoke or quit less than 1 year before the visit.
Race and ethnicity were reported by the patient.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in clinical characteristics among smoking
groups (never, 15 pack-years, and >15 pack-years) were
tested using the chi-square test for categorical variables and
analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables.
Overall survival time was measured from the date of diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC until the date of death. Liv-

ing patients were censored at the date of last evaluation at
the institution. Survival data were obtained using the medical record and the Social Security death index. Survival
status was updated in March 2008. Survival probabilities
were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared among different groups using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were
performed to identify variables with independent prognostic significance. Statistical analyses were performed using
SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
We evaluated 2010 patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC
between June 2003 and March 2006. The demographic
characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1.
Never-smokers comprised 16% of the study cohort,
with current and former smokers representing 29% and
54% of the patients, respectively. Former and current
smokers were subdivided into patients who had smoked
15 pack-years and those who had smoked >15 packyears.17 Never-smokers and former or current smokers
with 15 pack-years of smoking were younger than
patients with a >15 pack-year smoking history (median
ages: 59 years, 60 years, and 65 years, respectively; P <
.001) and were more likely to be women (66%, 60%,
and 44%, respectively; P < .001). The majority of the
patients were white. The largest proportion of Asian
patients was among never-smokers (15%) compared
with those with 15 pack-years (6%) and >15 packyears (1%) groups.
Survival Analysis
A total of 1568 deaths (78%) had occurred at the time of
analysis. Never-smokers had a longer median survival
than former and current smokers (17.8 months vs 11.3
months; log-rank P < .001) (Fig. 1). Never-smokers had
a 2-year survival rate of 39% compared with 21% for former and current smokers (log-rank P < .001) (Fig. 1).
The effect on survival of the amount of cigarette smoking
was apparent when we subdivided the former and current
smokers into 15 pack-years and >15 pack-years groups.
Never-smokers had a 3-month longer median survival
compared with smokers who smoked 15 pack-years,
and a 7-month longer survival compared with those who
smoked >15 pack-years (17.8 months vs 14.6 months
vs 10.8 months; log-rank P ¼ .03) (Fig. 2). Similarly, the
2-year survival rate was greatest for never-smokers compared with 15 pack-year and >15 pack-year smokers

(39% vs 29% vs 20%; log-rank P ¼ .03). We further subdivided former and current smokers into groups by
smaller increments of pack-years smoked. Due to the large
number of subgroups, the survival data are presented as
median survivals (Fig. 3). As the number of pack-years
increased, the median survival decreased. In univariate
analysis, which included weight loss, sex, age, KPS, and
smoking history, smoking history was found to predict
overall survival, with a hazard ratio similar to that of other
known prognostic factors (Table 2). In a multivariate
analysis (Table 3), which included sex, age, KPS, and
weight loss, cigarette smoking history was an independent
prognostic factor.

DISCUSSION
NSCLC in never-smokers has a distinct biology, natural
history, and responsiveness to EGFR TKI therapy.27

672

Although multiple previous studies have demonstrated
the negative effects of smoking on patients with NSCLC,
these results are confounded by several factors.1-16 In
some reports, never-smokers accounted for a small
proportion of patients.6,10 Although the majority of
reports defined never-smokers as individuals who smoked
<100 cigarettes, some previous studies have used inconsistent definitions of never-smokers.5-8,15 In other
studies, retrospective chart reviews did not include a
detailed dose quantification by pack-years of cigarettes
smoked.3,6-8,11,13,15,16 Most studies included a heterogeneous population comprised of patients with all stages
and types of lung cancer.1,3,5,6,8,10,11,15 Small cell lung
cancer, a disease with a different natural history from
NSCLC, has even been included in some analyses.6,10
In contrast, the current study cohort consisted exclusively of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. We
obtained detailed smoking history data by using a

the amount of cigarette smoking and survival. Our analysis is unique because it demonstrates that the amount of
cigarette smoking is important.
Although the large number of patients with a clearly
documented cigarette smoking history and a uniform
stage of disease make these data powerful, there are limitations to our analysis. Current and former smokers were
grouped together in this analysis. Although several other
studies have shown that lung cancer patients who continue to smoke have a poorer outcome,6,8-10,14 to the best
of our knowledge, the current study is the first to highlight
a significant dose-response relation between smoking and
survival. Patients in this cohort received a wide variety of
therapies, raising the possibility that the outcomes could
have been affected by the particular therapies administered. Scagliotti et al noted that never-smokers with
NSCLC who received 1 of 2 cisplatin-based doublet
chemotherapies had a 5-month better median survival
compared with former or current smokers, supporting a
survival difference based on smoking status and

independent of treatment type.28 Because patients with
a minimal smoking history are more likely to carry sensitizing EGFR mutations and therefore respond to erlotinib or gefitinib, there is a possibility that the effect on
overall survival is a result of EGFR TKIs. However, earlier patient cohorts studied by Nordquist et al and
Marks et al that demonstrated survival differences based
on cigarette use were not treated with EGFR TKIs.8,29
Finally, we have not performed a systematic evaluation
of the medical comorbidities for these patients. We have
accounted for these issues by adjusting for KPS, age, and
weight loss through the multivariate analysis. The uniformly short overall survival reported for patients with
advanced NSCLC makes it unlikely that medical
comorbidities alone could account for the findings
observed here. Toh et al demonstrated that there was no
significant association between the presence of comorbidities and survival on univariate and multivariate analyses.11 Finally, in the study by Nordquist et al, the
improvements in overall survival noted with neversmokers were the same as the improvements observed
with regard to cancer-specific survival.8
These results, together with published studies,
emphasize the negative prognostic effects of cigarette
smoking in patients with NSCLC.1-16 We believe we
have demonstrated for the first time that an inverse relation exists between the extent of cigarette smoking and
survival. These data suggest that NSCLC in neversmokers is at 1 end of a spectrum, demonstrating the
negative prognostic impact of cigarette smoking. Based
on these findings, we recommend that, in clinical trials,
when an imbalance could exist in the amount of cigarettes smoked by patients in the comparison arms, investigators should stratify patients by smoking status. All
clinical trials assessing survival in patients with stage
IIIB/IV NSCLC should report the cigarette smoking
history for all patients.
