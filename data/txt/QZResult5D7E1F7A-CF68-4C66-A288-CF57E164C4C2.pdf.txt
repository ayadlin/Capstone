BACKGROUND: Survival rates for gastrointestinal (GI) and bronchopulmonary (BP) neuroendocrine tumors
(NETs) have not altered significantly (5-year survival rate: GI NETs, 64.1%; BP NETs, 87%-89%) in 30 years
(from 1973 to 2004). No effective or specific antineoplastic agents are available to date, although somatostatin analogs inhibit NET 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) secretion. Given the expression of 5-HT receptors
on NETs, the authors hypothesized that 5-HT autoregulated NET proliferation. METHODS: Proliferation was
evaluated in 3 NET cell lines using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide uptake; in
addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies
were performed to delineate 5-HT–mediated signaling pathways. To determine the receptor and role of endogenous 5-HT production, the effects of ketanserin (5-HT receptor subtypes 2A and 2C [5-HT2A/2C]);
ondansetron (5-HT3); and the suicide inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis, tryptophan
hydroxylase (7-HTP) were investigated. RESULTS: Exogenously added 5-HT stimulated proliferation in atypical BP NET NCI-H720 cells (þ50%; half-maximal stimulatory concentration [EC50] ¼ 10 nM), in typical BP
NET NCI-H727 cells (þ40%; EC50 ¼ 0.01 nM), and in GI NET KRJ-I cells (þ60%; EC50 ¼ 25 nM). In NCI-H720
cells, proliferation was inhibited by ketanserin (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] ¼ 0.06 nM) and
ondansetron (IC50 ¼ 0.4 nM) and also was inhibited by 7-HTP (IC50 ¼ 0.3 nM). In NCI-H727 cells, ketanserin
and 7-HTP inhibited proliferation (IC50 ¼ 0.3 nM and IC50 ¼ 2.3 nM, respectively), whereas ondansetron had
no effect. In KRJ-I cells, ketanserin (IC50 ¼ 0.1 nM) and 7-HTP (IC50 ¼ 0.6 nM), but not ondansetron, inhibited proliferation. In all cell lines, 5-HT activated proliferation through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1
(ERK1) and ERK2 phosphorylation and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated pathways (c-JUN and Ki67 transcription). An autoregulatory effect was indicated by the 7-HTP–mediated inhibition of extracellular
5-HT and downstream effects on NET proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Lung and GI NET proliferation was
autoregulated by 5-HT through alterations in ERK and JNK signaling. Targeting NET cells with 5-HT2 receptor antagonists and 7-HTP reversed proliferation. The current results indicated that 5-HT2 receptor subtype-specific antagonists may represent a viable antiproliferative therapeutic strategy. Cancer

5-HT in Neuroendocrine Tumor Cell Lines/Drozdov et al

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)—previously
termed ‘‘carcinoids’’—account for 0.66% of all malignancies. They generally are considered ‘‘slow-growing’’ and of
minor oncologic importance; however, their incidence
has increased 3% to 10% per year over the last 30 years,1-3
and the majority of gastrointestinal (GI) tract lesions are
nonlocalized.1-3 They are located predominantly in the
GI tract (66%; the majority [60%] are small intestinal
NETs) and in the bronchopulmonary (BP) system
(31%).1-3 It is recognized today that the highly specialized
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptophan [5-HT])-producing
enterochromaffin cells and the 5-HT–secreting pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are progenitor cells of the majority of GI NETs and BP NETs.2,4 The role of 5-HT in
the manifestation of ‘‘carcinoid syndrome’’ (cutaneous
flushing, bronchospasm, and diarrhea) is well known,5
whereas both 5-HT–mediated flushing and diarrhea and
the nausea associated with cancer therapy can be inhibited
by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin6 and the
5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron, respectively.7,8
In addition, somatostatin analogs have become an important part of the treatment of carcinoid syndrome.9 In general, these agents reduce urine 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid
by approximately 25% to 50%,10 suggesting the inhibition of 5-HT secretion.
Apart from its role in flushing, nausea, and diarrhea,
5-HT has mitogenic effects in fibroblasts,11 smooth muscle cells,12 osteoblasts,13 mesangial cells,14 and endothelial
cells.15 Although the exact mechanism of mitogenic
5-HT action is unknown, it has been demonstrated that
some subtypes (5-HT1B, 5-HT2A) of 5-HT receptors can
directly facilitate activation of the extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) pathway16-18 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. To our knowledge, a role for
5-HT in mediating NET proliferation has not been studied previously but is suggested by the recently published
‘‘Placebo-Controlled Prospective Randomized Study on
the Antiproliferative Efficacy of Octreotide LAR in
Patients With Metastatic Neuroendocrine Midgut
Tumors’’ (PROMID) phase 3 study, which demonstrated
that tumor growth and the development of hepatic metastases could be inhibited by octreotide acetate (Sandostatin
LAR; Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland).19
Because this agent is a known inhibitor of 5-HT release
but is not recognized as a direct antiproliferative agent,
there is a need to delineate whether 5-HT secreted from

tumors is a proliferative regulator and to identify the mitogenic mechanisms that regulate amine-mediated proliferation in this tumor type.
We analyzed the proliferative effects of 5-HT on 3
human NET (carcinoid) cell lines (atypical BP NET:
NCI H-720, a typical BP NET: NCI-H727, and the
small intestinal NET: KRJ-I20,21) to investigate whether
NET cells autoregulate proliferation through 5-HT production and secretion. In addition, we examined the effect
of ketanserin (5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist); ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist); the suicide inhibitor of
the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis, tryptophan
hydroxylase (Tph-1) (7-HTP); and PD98059 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway inhibitor)
on the mechanisms of proliferation and cellular
transcription.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Culture Conditions
KRJ-I and NCI-H720 cells were cultured as floating
aggregates at 37 C with 5% CO2. KRJ-I cells were kept in
Ham F-12 medium (Gibco; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, Mo).21,22 For NCI-H720, a 1:1 solution of Ham F-12 and Dulbecco minimal essential medium supplemented with final concentrations of FBS
(5%), insulin (0.005 mg/mL), transferrin (0.01 mg/mL),
sodium selenite (30 nM), hydrocortisone (10 nM),
b-estradiol (10 nM), N-(2-hydroxethyl) piperazine-NA2-ethanesulfonic acid medium (10 mM), and L-glutamine (2 mM).20 The adhesive, growing NCI-H727 cells
were kept at 37 C in RPMI-1640 medium that contained
final concentrations of FBS (10%), L-glutamine (2 mM),
sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and glucose (2.5 g/L).20 For
further processing, NCI-H727 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline before trypsin-ethylene diamine tetracetic acid was applied.

Proliferation Studies
After the cells were spun down (for 5 minutes at 1500g),
the pellets of the 3 cell lines were resuspended in each medium to 5  105 cells/mL and seeded in 96-well plates at
with 100 lL at 5  104 cells per well (2 plates per

negative (media only) and positive (pure cell suspension)
controls, respectively. 5-HT, ketanserin, and 7-HTP were
diluted in respective cell media and applied in final
concentrations from 1012 M to 106 M.

5-HT, ketanserin (5-HT2A/2C antagonist), ondansetron
(5-HT3 antagonist), and PD98059 were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, and 7-HTP (suicide inhibitor) was
obtained from SYNCHEM Laborgemeinschaft (Kassel,

204; E10 monoclonal antibody) of each protein (for
60 minutes at room temperature). After washing and secondary antibody application (for 60 minutes at room
temperature), the cells were incubated with color developer (for 10 minutes at room temperature), and the plates
were read at 450 nm. Thereafter, protein was assayed in
each well (protein development; reading at 595 nm).
Results were calculated as antibody reading (at 450 nm)/
protein concentration (measured at 595 nm) and normalized to unstimulated cells. Phosphorylated signal was
compared with total nonphosphorylated signal.

3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide Assay

Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
Analysis

After 72 hours of incubation (37 C; 5% CO2), 3-[4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) was added to cell lines at a final concentration of
0.5 mg/mL per well followed by additional incubation for
3 hours.23 The reaction was stopped, and the formazan
dye was solubilized by adding an equal volume (100 lL)
of acid-isopropanol (0.01 N HCl in isopropanol). The
optical density was read at 595 nanometers (nm) (microplate reader; Bio-Rad 3500; Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif).22

RNA was extracted from 2  106 NCI-H720 cells, NCIH727 cells, and KRJ-I cells in log phase growth (n ¼ 3
experiments) (TRIZOL; Invitrogen) and cleaned (Qiagen
RNeasy kit and DNeasy Tissue kit; Qiagen Sciences, Inc.,
Germantown, Md) to minimize contaminating genomic
DNA. RNA (2 lg) was converted to combinational DNA
cDNA (High Capacity cDNA Archive kit; Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, Calif).24,25 Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was
performed using Assays-on-Demand products and the
ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System according to the
manufacturer’s suggestions (Applied Biosystems).24,25
Cycling was performed under standard conditions (TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix Protocol; Applied Biosystems), and data were normalized using geNorm25 and
NET house-keeping gene expression (using the asparaginine-linked glysosylation 9 gene ALG9, the transcription
factor CP2 gene TFCP2, and the zinc finger protein 410
gene ZNF410)26.

Chemicals

Enzyme-Linked Immunoadsorbent Assay
The effects of 5-HT, ketanserin, 7-HTP, and PD98059
on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and
ERK2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway were measured in
NET cells as described.22 Cells were stimulated with
5-HT or 7-HTP or with combinations of 5-HT and
ketanserin or 7-HTP and PD98059 for 30 minutes. The
half-maximal stimulatory concentration (EC50) or the
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated, except for PD98059, for which 0.1 lM was used.
ERK1/2 phosphorylation was measured by using an
enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) kit (the
SuperArray Cellular Activation of Signaling ELISA
[CASE] kit; SABiosciences Corporation, Frederick, MD)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, stimulated cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained
with either primary antibodies against the nonphosphorylated form (a-ERK; P42-P44/MAPK polyclonal

and PD98059. EC50 or IC50 concentrations were used
except for PD98059 (0.1 lM). Cells were cultured for 24
hours before RNA extraction. RNA was isolated using the
standard PCR protocol.24,25

Extracellular 5-Hydroxytryptophan Content
One hundred microliters of NCI-H720 cells, NCI-H727
cells, and KRJ-I cells (2  104 cells per 100 lL) were
seeded into 96-well plates, and an ELISA was used to
measure the 5-HT that was released into media from
untreated cells after incubations of 0 hours, 24 hours, and
48 hours, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Serotonin EIA; Rocky Mountain Diagnostics, Colorado
Springs, Colo). Similar measurements were performed
after 24 hours and 48 hours after the administration of
7-HTP (IC50 concentration).

Statistical Evaluation
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 4
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif). Sigmoidal dose
responses and nonlinear regression analyses were calculated to identify the EC50 and IC50 concentrations for
each agent. Alterations in signal transduction and transcriptional activation were assessed using 2-tailed Student
t tests for paired data.

RESULTS
Receptor Profile by Polymerase Chain
Reaction Analysis
Initially, we used a real-time PCR approach to analyze
5-HT receptor subtypes in each of the NET cell lines. The
NCI-H720 cell line was derived from an ‘‘atypical’’ BP
NET,20 and transcripts for the 5-HT2A/2C and 5-HT3A
receptors were identified in these cells (Fig. 1A). NCIH727 was derived from a ‘‘typical’’ BP NET20 and
expressed transcripts for the 5-HT2C receptor (Fig. 1B).
KRJ-I was derived from a ‘‘typical’’ small intestinal
NET,21 and the receptor profile in this cell line was
5-HT2C (Fig. 1C).
Proliferative Effects of 5-HT
Having identified that NET cell lines expressed 5-HT
receptors, next, we evaluated whether exogenously added
5-HT stimulated proliferation and if this could be inhibited by selective 5-HT receptor antagonists. 5-HT
induced proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner (þ50%; EC50 ¼ 10 nM) in NCI-H720 cells
(Fig. 2A). This 5-HT–mediated effect was reversed by
ketanserin (IC50 ¼ 0.06 nM) and ondansetron (IC50 ¼
0.4 nM), whereas both of these agents also inhibited basal
(unstimulated) proliferation (ketanserin: 30%; IC50 ¼
0.1 nM; ondansetron: 10%; IC50 ¼ 0.01 nM)

FIGURE 2. These charts illustrate the effect of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) and specific antagonists on neuroendocrine tumor
proliferation. 5-HT stimulated proliferation in all cell lines. In (A) NCI-H720 cells, the half-maximal stimulatory concentration
(EC50) was 10 nM; in (B) NCI-H727 cells, the EC50 was 0.01 nM; and in (C) KRJ-I cells, the EC50 was 25 nM. In the NCI-H720 cell
line, which expressed the 5-HT2/3 receptor subtypes, 5-HT-stimulated proliferation was inhibited by (A) ketanserin (half-maximal
inhibitory concentration [IC50] ¼ 0.06 nM) and ondansetron (IC50 ¼ 0.4 nM), whereas those agents also (D) inhibited basal proliferation (IC50 ¼ 0.1 nM and 0.01 nM, respectively). (B) In the 5-HT2-expressing NCI-H727 cell line, ketanserin inhibited both 5-HTstimulated proliferation (IC50 ¼ 0.3 nM) and (E) basal proliferation (IC50 ¼ 0.50 nM), whereas ondansetron had no effect on either
parameter. In the (C) 5-HT2C-expressing KRJ-I cell line, ketanserin inhibited both 5-HT-stimulated proliferation (IC50 ¼ 0.1 nM) and
(E) basal proliferation (IC50 ¼ 0.3 nM), whereas ondansetron had no effect, consistent with the receptor profile of this cell line.

(Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that 5-HT stimulates
proliferation of this atypical lung cell line through the activation of both 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. In the typical
lung cell line (NCI-H727), 5-HT induced proliferation
with an estimated EC50 of 0.01 nM (Fig. 2B). This effect
was reversed by ketanserin (IC50 ¼ 0.3 nM), which also
inhibited basal (unstimulated) proliferation (15%; IC50
¼ 0.50 nM) (Fig. 2E). Ondansetron had no measurable
effect on either 5-HT–stimulated proliferation or on basal
proliferation, consistent with the absence of a 5-HT3 receptor on this cell line (Fig. 2B) (Table 1). In KRJ-I cells,
proliferation was activated by 5-HT (þ40%; EC50 ¼ 25
nM) (Fig. 2C). Inhibitory effects on both 5-HT–stimu4938

lated proliferation and basal proliferation were observed in
response to ketanserin (IC50 ¼ 0.1 nM and IC50 ¼ 0.3
nM, respectively (Figs. 2C and 2F). Ondansetron had little
measurable effect consistent, with the 5-HT receptor profile on this small intestinal cell (Fig. 2C) (Table 1).

Effects of the 7-HTP on NET Cells
After demonstrating a role for exogenous 5-HT in the regulation of NET cell proliferation, we evaluated whether
inhibition of endogenous 5-HT production and secretion
with 7-HTP inhibited NET proliferation. In initial studies, we evaluated the effect of 7-HTP on 5-HT secretion.

In NCI-H720 cells, the mean extracellular levels of
5-HT in untreated cells measured at 0 hours, 24 hours,
and 48 hours were 11.3 ng/mL, 43.9 ng/mL, and 36.1
ng/mL, respectively. The administration of 7-HTP inhibited 5-HT secretion significantly to concentrations of
23.6 ng/mL at 24 hours (P < .05) and 18.5 ng/mL at 48
hours (P < .05) (Fig. 3A). In NCI-727 cells, the extracellular 5-HT content remained elevated and constant (133
ng/mL) after 24 hours and after 48 hours compared with
the initial reading (66.7 ng/mL; P < .01). Stimulation of
these cells with 7-HTP resulted in the inhibition of 5-HT
secretion after 24 hours and 48 hours (61.3 ng/mL and
61.1 ng/mL, respectively; P < .05) (Fig. 3B). In KRJ-I
cells, the extracellular 5-HT content increased in a timedependant manner; 173.9 ng/mL, 278.2 ng/mL, and
318.1 ng/mL concentrations were observed at 0 hours, 24
hours, and 48 hours, respectively. At 24 hours and 48
hours, 7-HTP inhibited 5-HT release to 117.5 ng/mL
(P < .01) and 191.1 ng/mL (P < .05), respectively (Fig.
3C). These results demonstrate that 7-HTP effectively
inhibited NET cell 5-HT secretion.

Next, we evaluated whether this decrease in secreted
5-HT was associated with a decrease in cell proliferation.
When NCI-H720 cells were incubated with 7-HTP, inhibition of basal proliferation was noted at low concentrations of this substrate (20%; IC50 ¼ 0.3 nM) (Fig. 3D)
(Table 1). In NCI-H727 cells, basal proliferation was
reversed by 7-HTP (20%; IC50 ¼ 2.3 nM) (Fig. 3E);
whereas, in KRJ-I cells, the observed inhibitory effect was
20% (IC50 ¼ 0.6 nM) (Fig. 3F). In the presence of exogenously added, excess 5-HT (1 lM), 7-HTP had no inhibitory effect on any cell line proliferation (Fig. 3D-F).
MTT uptake in these cells was not different in untreated
cells, indicating that the inhibitory effect of 7-HTP was
not caused by a direct cytotoxic effect on the cells but,
rather, reflected the inhibition of 5-HT production.

were measured in cell media alone and in media with cultured cells. 5-HT levels in media ranged between 0.7 ng/mL and 7.3 ng/mL.
(A-C) Concentrations of 5-HT (ng/mL) increased over time (24 hours, 48 hours) in all neuroendocrine tumor cell lines. 5-HT secretion

5-HT (100 nM) reversed 7-TPH inhibition of proliferation. The values shown are the mean  standard error of the mean from 4 to 6

pathway was involved in amine-mediated signal transduction, because this pathway is a well characterized, growth
factor-regulated pathway in NET cells.27,28 Because we
were interested in pathways that were common to all 3
cell types, we focused on the 5-HT2C receptor and the
effects of 7-HTP on ERK signaling. For these studies, we
used an ELISA to quantify the effects of 5-HT (100 nM),
5-HT plus ketanserin (100 nM), 7-HTP (100 nM),
7-HTP plus 5-HT (both 100 nM), and PD98059 plus
5-HT (both 100 nM) on ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
In NCI-H720 cells, 5-HT phosphorylated ERK 1/2
(48.8%; P < .01 vs control). This effect was reduced to
22.1% (P < .01 vs control) when cells were treated with
ketanserin followed by 5-HT (5-HT plus ketanserin).
The inhibition of ERK phosphorylation was observed in
response to 7-HTP (22.6%; P < .01 vs control), an
4940

effect that was reversed in the presence of exogenously
added 5-HT. The ERK inhibitor, PD98059, also reduced
5-HT–mediated ERK phosphorylation significantly to
10%, confirming that amine-mediated growth signaling
occurs through the MAPK pathway (Fig. 4A) (Table 1). In
NCI-H727 cells, 5-HT increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation (þ3%; P ¼ .07); whereas 5-HT plus ketanserin inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation (7%; P < .01 vs control).
Similarly, in response to 7-HTP, phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 was decreased (17%; P < .01 vs control), an
effect that was not observed after 5-HT was added to cells.
In NCI-H720 cells, PD98059 inhibited 5-HT–mediated
ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4B) (Table 1). In KRJ-1 cells,
5-HT induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (31.4%;

ERK1/2 phosphorylation by 10% (P < .01 vs control)

5-HT–mediated phosphorylation.

Effects of 5-HT, Ketanserin, and 7-HTP on
Downstream Transcriptional Targets
Amine-mediated signal transduction in each of the cell
lines is mediated by the 5-HT2 receptor through ERK1/2
phosphorylation. Because signaling through this pathway
is associated with activation of c-Jun and Ki67 transcripts
(markers of cell proliferation),27,28 next, we evaluated
whether 5-HT stimulated the transcription of these ERK
targets in each of the cell lines.
In NCI-H720 cells, real-time PCR analysis (5-HT,
100 nM for 24 hours) demonstrated that c-JUN transcript
levels were significantly increased (72%) compared with
unstimulated cells (P < .01) (Fig. 5A) (Table 1). Ki67 levels were noted to be elevated 13.4% compared with control (P < .01 vs control) (Fig. 5B) (Table 1), which was
consistent with the observation that 5-HT increased NCIH720 cell proliferation. In 5-HT–stimulated cells that
were coincubated with ketanserin, c-JUN and Ki-67 tranCancer

script levels were decreased to 16.6% and 3%, respectively
(P < .01 vs 5-HT alone), confirming that this compound
inhibited 5-HT-mediated NCI-H720 cell proliferation.
A similar observation was noted when 7-HTP decreased
c-JUN and Ki-67 transcript levels by 74% and 95%,
respectively (P < .01 vs control). This effect was reversed
in the presence of excess, exogenous 5-HT. We also noted
that the addition of PD98059 inhibited 5-HT–mediated
c-JUN and Ki-67 transcripts, confirming that ERK signaling coupled 5-HT2 receptor activation and JNK transcription. In NCI-H727 cells, 5-HT increased c-JUN
transcripts (3.2%; P ¼ .06 vs control) (Fig. 5C) (Table 1);
whereas Ki-67 transcription was elevated 17.9% compared with control (P < .01) (Fig. 5D) (Table 1), indicating that the proliferative effect of this amine principally
occurred through activation of Ki-67 transcription. In the
presence of exogenous 5-HT, ketanserin had no effect on
c-JUN transcript levels, whereas Ki-67 transcript levels
were decreased (2.4%; P < .05). 7-HTP inhibited c-JUN
and Ki-67 transcripts by 91% and 57%, respectively,
consistent with its antiproliferative effects; however, no
effect was identified after exogenous 5-HT was applied to
the cells (Table 1). PD98059 reversed 5-HT–mediated

inhibited 5-HT–stimulated c-JUN transcription (2.1%;

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that 5-HT plays an autocrine
proliferative role in BP and GI 5-HT-secreting neoplastic
neuroendocrine cell lines through phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 and activation of the JNK pathway. Targeting
these NET cells with 5-HT receptor subtype-specific
antagonists and 7-HTP reversed proliferation through inhibition of 5-HT synthesis, release, and 5-HT2 receptor
activation.
A real-time PCR assessment of the 5-HT receptor
subtypes (5HT2A/2C and 5HT3A) in NET cell lines indicated that 5-HT2C was expressed commonly in both BP
and GI NET cell lines. In addition, the atypical BP NET,
NCI-H720, also expressed transcripts for 5-HT2A and
5-HT3. In the current study, the mitogenic effects of
5-HT in NET cell lines was concentration-dependant and
produced EC50 values in the nM range. These ranges were
similar to those identified in a 5-HT–secreting prostate
cancer cell line (PC3; E50 ¼ 10 nM29) but significantly
lower than in the 5-HT2A–expressing MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (10 mM).30 It is noteworthy that the endogenous 5-HT concentrations in the cell culture media were
low (<0.1 nM). Secretion of this amine over the experimental period resulted in exposure of the cells to concentrations as high as 0.1 lM to 1 lM. Decreasing secreted
5-HT by the addition of 7-HTP (usually by 50%-70%)
inhibited NET proliferation. This effect was reversed by
adding 5-HT (107 M; 20 ng/mL), indicating that
5-HT was required to autoregulate proliferation. These
reductions in 5-HT are similar to those caused by somatostatin analogs10 and suggests 1 mechanism by which these
agents inhibit NET growth. It also is noteworthy that
5-HT concentrations in normal blood ranged between
107 M and 106 M and can be from 15 to 20 times
greater in patients with NETs.31 In addition, tissue levels
Cancer

of 5-HT, particularly in carcinoid tumors, are similar,32
suggesting that systemic or local 5-HT concentrations are
sufficient to regulate NET growth, whereas decreasing
those concentrations may reverse proliferation.
The proliferative effects of 5-HT on NET cells was
inhibited by the 5-HT2A/2C antagonist ketanserin in all
cell lines and by the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron in
NCI-H720 cells. These findings are consistent with the
5-HT receptor profile in these cell lines. In addition,
although ondansetron was a potent inhibitor in all NET
cell lines, NCI-H720 cells were 10 times more sensitive
to ketanserin. This is consistent with observations that
5-HT2C receptors have the highest affinity for 5-HT; however, it also suggests that targeting multiple 5-HT receptor
subtypes (when they are expressed) may be an effective
strategy for inhibiting NET proliferation at different sites.
To investigate the subcellular mechanisms that regulate the mitogenic effects of 5-HT in NET cell lines, we
measured phosphorylation of ERK and performed realtime PCR to assess the effects of this amine on transcript
levels of c-JUN and the proliferation marker Ki-67. Previous studies have demonstrated that Ras-dependent ERK
activation as well as c-JUN transcriptional regulation is
involved in NET cell proliferation27,28 and is a common
feature of neoplastic cell proliferation pathways.33-35 In
addition, recent studies have demonstrated that 5-HT receptor subtypes induce cellular proliferation through
direct coupling with ERK.17 Coupling of 5-HT2C receptors to ERK activation has been reported in studies using
Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts.36 To our knowledge, it
has not been reported previously that the 5-HT3 receptor,
a ligand-gated ion channel, couples to ERK; however, it
appears that this 5-HT receptor subtype may be involved
in neuroprotective pathways17,37 through the inhibition
of cytosolic Ca2þ concentration and through the activity
of caspase-3, which is an indicator of apoptosis.38
In the current study, NCI-H720 and KRJ-I cell line
proliferation was induced by 5-HT through the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and that proliferation was followed
by the activation of c-JUN transcription and the up-regulation of Ki-67,which is a cyclin marker of cellular proliferation. Consistent with its antiproliferative effects,
ketanserin inhibited the transcription of c-JUN and Ki-67
and the phosphorylation of ERK, suggesting that the
5-HT2C receptor may be activated in the presence of
basally released 5-HT. These observations suggest that
4943

Original Article

5-HT2C receptor subtypes are coupled to the ERK-JNK
pathway in NET cell lines. However, it is noteworthy
that, although 5-HT induced proliferation in the typical
BP cell line, NCI-H727 (Ki-67 transcripts were elevated),
it did not phosphorylate ERK significantly, and no effect
on c-JUN transcription was noted. However, ketanserin
reversed 5-HT–mediated proliferation largely through
the inhibition of Ki-67 transcription, suggesting that the
5-HT2C receptor in this cell line is coupled to proliferation; however, the exact signaling pathway remains to be
defined.
To investigate whether newly synthesized 5-HT was
involved in the regulation of NET cell proliferation,
7-HTP was used to inhibit the biosynthesis of 5-HT.
7-HTP is a competitive inhibitor of Tph-1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of 5-HT, and is converted
by Tph-1 and the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase into
5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT).39,40 The addition
of 7-HTP inhibited 5-HT levels significantly in each of
the cell lines from >50% to 70%, and that inhibition was
associated with a decrease in proliferation through the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the down-regulation of c-JUN and Ki-67 transcription. These effects
could be reversed by adding exogenous 5-HT (0.1 lM).
We interpret these data to suggest an autocrine role for
5-HT in NET cell proliferation. It also is worth noting
that 7-HTP was a more potent inhibitor of the downstream targets than ketanserin in all cell lines. This suggests that an aspect of the inhibitory effects of this agent
may be consistent with the cytotoxicity demonstrated in
earlier studies.40
In conclusion, our investigations demonstrate that
lung and GI NET cell proliferation is autoregulated by
endogenously produced 5-HT. These amine-mediated,
proliferative effects are associated with ERK1/2 and JNK
signaling through c-JUN and Ki-67 expression and can be
inhibited by 5-HT2/3 receptor targeting and through the
inhibition of 5-HT synthesis. Given the relation between
the somatostatin-mediated inhibition of 5-HT secretion
and the reduction in NET growth in a recent study,19 our
observations suggest that the 5-HT receptor pathway
plays a role in regulating tumor growth and may provide
1 explanation for these observations. In addition, the current results suggest that targeting multiple 5-HT receptor
subtypes (when expressed) may be an effective, complementary strategy for inhibiting NET proliferation.
