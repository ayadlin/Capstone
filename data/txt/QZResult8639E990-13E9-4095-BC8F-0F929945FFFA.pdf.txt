Abstract
Studies from tumor cells suggest that tumor-suppressor AIP1
inhibits epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the
role of AIP1 in the tumor microenvironment has not been
examined. We show that a global or vascular endothelial cell
(EC)–speciﬁc deletion of the AIP1 gene in mice augments tumor
growth and metastasis in melanoma and breast cancer models.
AIP1-deﬁcient vascular environment not only enhances tumor
neovascularization and increases premetastatic niche formation,
but also secretes tumor EMT-promoting factors. These effects from

AIP1 loss are associated with increased VEGFR2 signaling in the
vascular EC and could be abrogated by systemic administration of
VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors. Mechanistically, AIP1 blocks VEGFR2dependent signaling by directly binding to the phosphotyrosine
residues within the activation loop of VEGFR2. Our data reveal
that AIP1, by inhibiting VEGFR2-dependent signaling in tumor
niche, suppresses tumor EMT switch, tumor angiogenesis, and
tumor premetastatic niche formation to limit tumor growth and
metastasis. Cancer Res; 75(17); 3492–504. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

sis, including vascular endothelial cells (EC), tumor-associated
macrophages (TAM), and bone marrow–derived cells (BMDC;
refs. 1, 6, 7). These cells are ﬁrstly activated by factors secreted by
tumor cells (5, 8), subsequently promoting tumor EMT, tumor
angiogenesis, tumor premetastatic niche formation, and metastasis. Therefore, the tumor cells and the host cells are interactive
and form a positive feedback loop. However, the underlying
molecular mechanisms regulating the tumor cell–tumor niche
interactions are not completely understood.
ASK1-interacting protein-1 (AIP1; also named as DAB2-interacting protein DAB2IP) is a recently identiﬁed signaling scaffolding protein. AIP1/DAB2IP has been shown to be downregulated
in a variety of human cancer tissues, including prostate cancer and
breast cancer (9, 10). Two genome-wide association studies of
aggressive prostate cancer suggest AIP1 as a putative prostate
tumor-suppressor gene (11). Further studies have shown that
AIP1 downregulation in cancer cells is primarily through epigenetic regulation of the AIP1 promoter. Speciﬁcally, AIP1 expression in cancer cells is suppressed by the polycomb-group protein
histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 (9, 12), which is consistently elevated in invasive breast and prostate carcinoma compared with normal breast and prostate epithelia, respectively (13).
Importantly, AIP1 is a major EZH2 target and silencing of AIP1 is a
key mechanism by EZH2 triggers tumor metastasis in mouse
prostate cancer models (12).
The function of AIP1 in tumor cells has been assessed by in vitro
proliferation and EMT assays, and by in vivo tumor progression
and metastasis analyses in mouse models. AIP1 contains multiple
signaling domains, including the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for membrane targeting, the PKC-conserved
region 2 (C2) domain for ASK1 interaction to induce apoptosis,
the Ras-GAP domain for inhibition of Ras (therefore, it has been
considered as a novel member of RAS-GAP family protein), the Cterminal period-like domain for inhibition of transcriptional
factor NF-kB, and the proline-rich for inhibition of the PI3K–Akt
survival pathway (14–17). By gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we and others have shown that AIP1 inhibits

In the absence of metastasis, cancer is largely a treatable disease.
Thus, early diagnosis of patients who will develop metastasis
could reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with this
disease. The development of metastasis depends on genetic
and/or epigenetic alterations that are intrinsic to cancer cells, and
extrinsic factors provided by the tumor microenvironment
(niche). Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from a primary
site to distant, secondary host organs and requires a number of
distinct steps, including epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT) of neoplastic epithelial cells for invasive growth, invasion
into adjacent tissue, entering the systemic circulation (intravasation), extravasation into surrounding tissue parenchyma, and
ﬁnally proliferation from microscopic growth (micrometastasis)
into macroscopic secondary tumors (1–4). Premetastatic niche
can also be formed at distant tissues before tumor cells arrive (5).
Multiple cell types have been shown to promote tumor metasta1

AIP1 in Tumor Niche Suppresses Tumor Metastasis

tumor growth, EMT and metastasis by inhibiting Ras, PI3K–Akt,
GSK-3–b-catenin, and NF-kB pathways (12, 16, 17). Moreover, it
has been reported that the inhibitory activity of AIP1 on NF-kB,
but not its Ras-GAP activity, is critical for its suppressor effect on
EMT in cancer models (12). Recent data also suggest that mutant
p53 in cancer cells, by binding to AIP1 in the cytoplasm, enhances
NF-kB activation to increase tumor metastasis (18).
However, the role of AIP1 in tumor niche has not been
explored. AIP1-KO mice exhibit enhanced inﬂammation and
pathologic angiogenesis (15, 19). Given that inﬂammation and
angiogenesis are required for tumor growth and metastasis, in the
present study, we determined the role of AIP1 in tumor micro-

environment in regulating tumor growth and metastasis using
various mouse breast cancer models. Our data suggest that AIP1 in
vascular EC represses tumor metastasis by modulating not only
tumor angiogenesis, but also tumor-associated premetastatic
niche formation and tumor cell EMT phenotype.

cell line was from CH3 BioSystems (catalog #940001). B16
melanoma cell lines, 168FRAN and 4T1 breast cancer cell lines,
and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line were sourced from the
ATCC. All cell lines were validated by STR proﬁling.
Mouse tumor model and in vivo evaluation of lung metastases
and treatments
A total of 1  106 mouse cancer cells (ATCC) were injected s.c.
in the right rear ﬂank of mice in a 50 mL volume of DMEM solution
(22). Tumor dimension (length, width, and depth) was measured
by electronic caliper coupled to computer that converted to tumor
volume. Lung metastases were established in mice by injecting 1 
105 B16 melanoma cells in 100 mL of Hank's Balanced Salt
Solution (Life Technologies), without Caþþ or Mgþþ, into the
tail vein. After 10 to 42 days, the mice were sacriﬁced according to
procedures approved by Yale's Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee, and the primary tumor and draining lymph nodes
were analyzed by histology.
Administration of VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor and VEGFR2neutralizing antibodies in mouse tumor models
VEGFR2 kinase Inhibitor I (Cat# 676480) was obtained from
Calbiochem. It is a highly selective, cell-permeable, reversible, and
ATP-competitive indolin-2-one class of receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) inhibitor (IC50 ¼ 70 nmol/L) for mouse VEGF-R2 (KDR/
Flk-1). It does not inhibit PDGF, EGF, and IGF-1 RTK activities
(IC50 > 100 mmol/L). For VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor experiments,
tumor-bearing mice were subjected to i.v. injection of 100 mL of
either DMSO or kinase inhibitor every other day. VEGFR2-neutralizing antibody DC101 was produced from hybridoma cells
that were obtained from the ATCC, using the BD CELLine 1000
system (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. DC101 and isotype control IgG1 (40 mg/kg) was injected
i.v. every other day.

AIP1 in Tumor Niche Suppresses Tumor Metastasis

Metastasis incidences (the percentage of mice with detectable
pigmented tumor nodules) to multiple organs, including lymph
node, lung, liver, spleen, and bone marrow, at 4 weeks were
signiﬁcantly increased in AIP1-KO mice (Fig. 1B). Detailed examination of lung tissues indicated that lung metastasis was detected
in AIP1-KO, but not in WT mice, as early as 3 weeks following
implantation (Fig. 1C with quantiﬁcation in Fig. 1D). Both the
number of tumor nodules and the percentage of tumor areas in
the lung were higher in AIP1-KO mice (Fig. 1E with quantiﬁcation
in Fig. 1F). AIP1-KO mice also exhibited enhanced tumor metastasis in lymph nodes (LN; Fig. 1G with quantiﬁcation in Fig. 1H).
AIP1 is highly abundant in vascular ECs but not in myeloid cells
(14, 15, 19, 24). To determined relative AIP1 expression levels in
tumor ECs, TAMs, and tumor cells, we implanted GFP-expressing
B16 melanoma subcutaneously or E0771 breast cancer cells
orthotopically into WT mice. Tumor tissues were harvested at 2
weeks postimplantation and CD31þ ECs, CD68þ TAMs and GFPþ
tumor cells were collected by FACS sorting. AIP1 mRNA levels
were determined by qRT-PCR. Results indicated that AIP1 was
highly expressed in tumor ECs, but only weakly in tumor cells and
was not expressed in TAMs (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To deﬁne the host cell type in which AIP1 regulates tumor
behavior, we applied the tumor models to the EC-speciﬁc AIP1knockout mice (AIP1-ecKO; AIP1lox/lox:VE-cad-Cre) mice. We ﬁrst
validated the deletion efﬁciency of AIP1 by qRT-PCR in freshly
isolated lung ECs from AIP1lox/lox (WT), AIP1-KO, and AIP1-ecKO
mice. AIP1 gene was completely deleted in ECs isolated from both
AIP1-KO and AIP1-ecKO, and AIP1 gene deletion was comparable
between AIP1-KO and AIP1-ecKO (Fig. 2A). In an orthotopic
breast cancer model with E0771 (a mouse metastatic breast cancer
cell lines derived from C57BL/6 mice), AIP1-ecKO exhibited
enhanced tumor growth and lung metastasis (Fig. 2B–F), comparable with the global AIP1-KO (Supplementary Fig. S2). These
results suggest that AIP1 in vascular EC suppresses tumor growth
and metastasis in the mouse models.
AIP1 deletion has no effect on tumor metastasis after a direct i.v.
injection of tumor cells
We next used AIP1-ecKO mice to deﬁne the mechanism by
which AIP1 in host limits tumor metastasis. Tumor metastasis
involves multiple steps, including tumor cell EMT switch, intravasation into the lymphatic system and/or the bloodstream,
extravasation from and survival/colonization in the host distance
tissues. Primary tumor cells, by secreting soluble factors, also

activate premetastasis niche at a distance tissue before their arrival
to the tissue (illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S3A). To determine
how AIP1 in host controls tumor metastasis, we directly injected
tumor cells (1  105) into bloodstream intravenously. Tumor
cells directly arrived at the lung tissue where they extravasated and
colonized, therefore, metastasized without processes of EMT
switch, intravasation, and pre-niche formation. We observed no
differences between WT and AIP-ecKO mice in lung metastasis as
determined by tumor nodule number and lung weight (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C). We further injected GFPþ B16 melanoma cells with fewer numbers (1  104), and examined extravasation of tumor cells to the lung. We did not observe signiﬁcant
differences between WT and AIP1-ecKO mice in the tumor cell
retention (at 30 minutes after injection) or extravasation (at 4
hours after injection; Supplementary Fig. S3D and S3E). These data
suggest that the AIP1 deletion in vascular EC affects tumor metastasis at a step(s) before extravasation, that is, tumor cell EMT
phenotypic change, tumor cell intravasation to lymphatic and/or
blood systems, and the formation of premetastasis niche.
Tumor angiogenesis but not tumor lymphangiogenesis is
increased in AIP1-ecKO mice with enhanced VEGFR2 signaling
Tumor angiogenesis and tumor lymphangiogenesis are
required for tumor growth and metastasis (25). We examined
tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by immunostaining
with anti-CD31 and anti–LYVE-1, respectively. Tumor vessel
density and area were signiﬁcantly enhanced in the AIP1-ecKO
mice (Fig. 3A and B), consistent with our results in inﬂammatory
angiogenesis models (15). Tumor implantation induced both
angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the sentinel lymph nodes
(LN) at 2 weeks postimplantation before tumor cell metastasis,
suggesting that LN angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis were
induced by tumor-derived angiogenic factors such as VEGFs
(26). Numbers of blood vessels (Fig. 3C and D), but not lymphatic vessels (Supplementary Fig. S4), were signiﬁcantly
enhanced in the AIP1-ecKO mice at the peritumoral region and
distant lymph nodes. We measured expression and activation of
VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, two potent angiogenic and lymphangiogenic receptors (27). Total and phosphorylation of VEGFR2, but
of VEGFR3 or total VEGFR1, were signiﬁcantly increased in tumor
tissues from AIP1-ecKO mice (Fig. 3E). Primary tumor induced
expression and phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 in
distant lymph nodes at 2 weeks postimplantation. However,
AIP1-ecKO exhibited enhanced expression of VEGFR2 (but not

increased tumor angiogenesis, but not lymphangiogenesis, in
AIP1-ecKO mice contributes to the enhanced tumor metastasis
in these mice.
Tumor-induced premetastatic niche formation is enhanced in
AIP1-ecKO mice with enhanced VEGFR2 signaling
Formation of premetastatic niche at a distant tissue is also
important for tumor metastasis, which can be regulated by tumorand bone marrow–derived cytokines (5, 8). It has been proposed
that upon activation by tumor-secreted factors (e.g., VEGF, IL6,
and SDF-1), vascular endothelium at the distant tissue can be
activated followed by inﬁltration of immune cells and bone

marrow cells (5, 8). We ﬁrst measured lung endothelial barrier
function by "Miles assay" using Evans-blue dye. AIP1-ecKO
exhibited higher permeability at day 14 post-tumor implantation
in an orthotopic breast cancer model (Fig. 4A). We also observed
upregulation of several premetastatic niche markers, including
ﬁbronectin, LOX, c-Kit, VEGFR1, CD34, and VEGFR2, in the lung
as detected by qRT-PCR. These genes were more greatly upregulated in tumor-bearing AIP1-ecKO lungs (Fig. 5B). However,
genes involved in lymphangiogenesis (e.g., VEGFR3) and arteriogenesis (e.g., Notch1 receptor and Dll4 ligand) were not altered.
We then determined whether gene expression of pre-niche markers
preceded tumor cell arrival at the lung. To this end, GFPþ tumor
cells were applied to orthotopic cancer model, and gene expression

AIP1 in Tumor Niche Suppresses Tumor Metastasis

advanced cancer patient (28). Consistently, we have observed
stronger VEGFR2 signaling in bone marrow EC progenitors from
AIP1-KO mice (15, 19, 24).
We next determined whether enhanced VEGFR2 signaling in
vascular EC contributes to augmented tumor angiogenesis and
premetastatic niche formation. To this end, a VEGFR2 tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI)-1 was applied to the orthotopic breast
cancer model as we recently described (21). VEGFR2 TKI significantly attenuated tumor-induced recruitment of VEGFR2þ cells
to the lung as detected by immunostaining (Fig. 4F and G).
VEGFR2 TKI also signiﬁcantly attenuated activation of VEGFR2
signaling in the lung as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 4H).
Of note, VEGFR2 TKI appeared to upregulate AIP1 expression in
WT mice, suggesting a potential AIP1-VEGFR2 autoregulatory
loop. Functionally, VEGFR2 TKI blocked tumor angiogenesis
(Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B) and premetastatic niche formation (Supplementary Fig. S6C), suggesting that observed
changes in tumor angiogenesis and premetastatic formation are
dependent on vascular VEGFR2 signaling. Importantly, tumor
growth and lung tumor metastasis in AIP1-ecKO mice were
blunted by VEGFR2 TKI (Fig. 4I and J). VEGFR2-dependent tumor
growth and metastasis in AIP1-ecKO mice were also blocked by
DC101, a monoclonal antibody speciﬁcally binds and neutralizes
VEGFR2 (Supplementary Fig. S6D–S6F; ref. 29).

of tumor markers (GFP and S100A2) and pre-metastatic niche
markers (ﬁbronectin and VEGFR2) in the lung tissues were measured by qRT-PCR. Clearly, upregulation of premetastatic niche
and VEGFR2 in the lung occurred on day 10 postimplantation
before tumor-speciﬁc markers could be detected on days 17 to 21
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Immunoblotting conﬁrmed that total
ﬁbronectin, phosphorylated and total VEGFR2 were upregulated in
the lung tissue at day 14 postimplantation before detection of
GFPþ tumor cells on day 21 (Fig. 4C). Very few activated VEGFR2þ
cells were found in resting WT and AIP1-ecKO lung tissues, and
tumor implantation induced a recruitment of activated VEGFR2þ
cells to the lung as visualized by phospho-VEGFR2 staining.
Importantly, tumor-induced activation of VEGFR2þ cells in the
lung was augmented in the AIP1-ecKO mice (Fig. 4D and E). Of
note, some VEGFR2þCD31 cells were detected and these cells are
likely the bone marrow–derived EC progenitors (EPC) that have
not been fully differentiated into CD31þ mature EC. Interestingly,
circulating VEGFR2 EPCs have been associated poor prognosis in

AIP1 binds to the VEGFR2 kinase activation loop and inhibits
VEGFR2-mediated signaling
The results above established a critical role AIP1-regulated
VEGFR2 in tumor metastasis, and we subsequently took biochemical approaches to deﬁne the mechanism by which AIP1
regulates VEGFR2 signaling. We have previously shown that AIP1
binds to an active form of VEGFR2, and a mutant AIP1 (AIP1KA1) with mutations at the ﬁrst lysine cluster within its C2
domain (K104-106 to A) loses the VEGFR2-binding activity
(15). A certain type of C2, similar to the SH2 domain, associates
with phosphotyrosines (30, 31). These observations prompted us
to determine whether AIP1 via its C2 binds to phosphotyrosine
residues on VEGFR2. To this end, we mutated the tyrosine residues
of VEGFR2 known to be autophosphorylated in response to
VEGF-A, including Y1054/1059, Y1175, and Y1121 (32, 33).
293T cells were cotransfected with VEGFR2 mutants along
with AIP1-N, the N-terminal half of AIP1 constitutively associating with VEGFR2 upon coexpression (15). Overexpression of
VEGFR2-WT induces autophosphorylation at pY1054/1059
(within the kinase activation loop), pY1175 (critical for activation
of PI3K and PLC-g activation) as well as other phosphotyrosines
involved in other signaling (Fig. 5A). The kinase-dead mutant
(VEGFR2-K868M) and the Y1054/1059F mutant abolished
VEGFR2 autophosphorylation at both pY1054/1059 and
pY1157. In contrast, mutations of other Y sites (Y1175, Y1214,
or Y801) had no effects on pY1054/1059. Association of VEGFR2
and AIP1 was determined by a coimmunoprecipitation assay. As
shown in Fig. 5B, AIP1 associated with VEGFR2-WT and Y1175F
mutant. However, the kinase-dead form and the Y1054/1059F
mutant failed to associate with AIP1. These results suggest that an
active form of VEGFR2 with phosphorylations at Y1054/1059 is
required for the AIP1 binding.
To further determine the role of VEGFR2 pY1054/1059 in the
AIP1 binding, we performed a peptide competition assay using
13-mer peptides ﬂanking the pY1054/1059 of VEGFR2
(RDIY1054KDPDY1059VRKG) in two forms: nonphosphorylated

AIP1 in Tumor Niche Suppresses Tumor Metastasis

(Y1054/1059-peptide) and phosphorylated peptides (pY1054/
1059-peptide). These peptides were initially designed for the
generation and afﬁnity puriﬁcation of the pY1054/1059-speciﬁc
antibody (32). We performed the coimmunoprecipitation assay
in the presence of 0.3 mmol/L of either Y1054/1059 peptide or
pY1054/1059 peptide. Addition of the pY1054/1059 peptide, but
not the Y1054/1059 peptide, disrupted the VEGFR2-AIP1 association (Fig. 5C), suggesting that phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at
Y1054/1059 is critical for the AIP1 binding. We also designed
a C2-peptide derived from the lysine-cluster 1 of AIP1 C2
domain (IEAKDLPAK104KK106YLCELCL where the lysine residues
are underlined; C2-KA peptide contains K to A mutations).
Interestingly, the C2-peptide, but not the C2-KA peptide, also
disrupted the VEGFR2–AIP1 complex, further supporting a critical
role of the lysine-cluster within the AIP1 C2 domain in the
VEGFR2 binding. Taken together, these data suggest that the
C2 lysine-cluster on AIP1 and the phosphotyrosine residues
1054/1059 on VEGFR2 are responsible for their interactions.
We then determined effects of the AIP1 binding on VEGFR2
activation and signaling. AIP1-deﬁcient mouse MLECs (15, 34)
were reconstituted by lentivirus-expressing AIP1-WT or AIP1-KA1
(a mutant defective in the VEGFR2 binding). VEGF-induced
phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and downstream signaling Akt were
blunted by re-expression of AIP1-WT but not AIP1-KA1 (Fig. 5D
and E). VEGF-stimulated migratory activities of MLECs were also
inhibited by AIP1-WT but not by AIP1-KA1 in a Transwell assay
(Fig. 5F). Taken together, our data support that AIP1 binds to the
VEGFR2 kinase activation loop and inhibits VEGFR2-mediated
signaling in the vasculature.
AIP1-deﬁcient EC enhances tumor cell EMT and invasion
When we examined tumor cell EMT and invasive markers
(E-cadherin, vimentin, b-catenin, snail, and NF-kB) in the orthotopic breast cancer model, we observed downregulation of
E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin, b-catenin, snail, and
NF-kB (p-p65) in the tumors from AIP1-ecKO mice compared
with WT. These changes were more profound at the peripheral
regions of the tumor (Supplementary Fig. S7). As an intrinsic EMT
suppressor, AIP1 is downregulated via epigenetic regulation by
EZH2 in tumor cells (12, 35). We examined whether AIP1
expression in tumor cells is altered upon transplantation into
AIP1-ecKO microenvironment. AIP1 expression in tumor cells
was dramatically downregulated within the peripheral regions in
the AIP1-ecKO host (Fig. 6A), correlating with increased EMT
markers in this region. Interestingly, EZH2, a component of PRC-2
responsible for the epigenetic suppression of AIP1 expression,
showed a reciprocal expression pattern of the AIP1 expression
(Fig. 6A). The changes of E-cadherin, NF-kB (p-p65), AIP1, and
EZH2 were also veriﬁed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6B and C).

These data suggest that the host microenvironment modulates
AIP1 expression and EMT phenotype of tumor cells.
AIP1-VEGFR2 signaling in vascular EC mediates tumor cell EMT
switch
To determine the mechanism by which the endothelial AIP1–
VEGFR2 axis regulates tumor cell EMT and metastasis, we ﬁrst
performed a modiﬁed Transwell migration assay to measure
permeability of WT and AIP1-KO MLECs to tumor cells by
counting tumor cells migration cross the conﬂuent MLEC monolayer (Fig. 7A). Despite that invasive 4T1-migrated cross WT
MLECs at higher rate compared with less malignant 168FRAN
cells, AIP1-KO MLECs were highly permeable to both 168FRAN
and 4T1 (Fig. 7B). We reasoned that AIP1-KO MLECs, by secreting
factors, regulated tumor cell EMT phenotypic changes. To test this
idea, we used a Transwell system to coculture 168FARN with WT
or AIP1-KO MLECs without direct cell–cell contacts (Fig. 7C).
Coculture of AIP1-KO MLECs (but not WT MLECs) strongly
induced EMT responses in 168FARN tumor cells (Fig. 7D and
E). However, re-expression of AIP1-WT or an ASK1-binding
defective mutant KA2, but not the VEGFR2-binding defective
mutant KA1, diminished the effects of AIP1-KO MLECs on tumor
cell EMT. These results suggest that vascular AIP1-VEGFR2, but not
AIP1-ASK1 signaling, regulates cocultured tumor cell EMT. Moreover, treatment of MLECs with VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor (TKI) in
the coculture system blocked AIP1-KO MLEC-enhanced
168FRAN EMT responses (Fig. 7F). Of note, tumor cell EMT
morphologic change was accompanied by upregulation of EZH2
with a reciprocal reduction of AIP1, increase in NF-kB activity and
NF-kB–dependent gene expression of metastasis-promoting factor IL6 (Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B). To test whether downregulation of AIP1 is a critical step for tumor cell EMT, we
examined AIP1 expression in breast cancer cell lines with various
metastatic potential (168FARN, 4T07 and 4T1; ref. 36). AIP1
expression was inversely correlated with EZH2 expression and
breast cancer cell metastatic potentials in these cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S8C). Consistent with a low level of AIP1 protein
and a high basal EMT in 4T1 cell, coculture of 4T1 cell with AIP1KO MLEC weakly enhanced its EMT (Supplementary Fig. S8D).
These data suggest that the VEGFR2 signaling in vascular EC
potently modulates an EZH2-AIP1–dependent EMT cascade in
tumor cells.
To deﬁne the MLEC-derived EMT factors that mediate tumor
cell EMT, we measured gene expression of a few known EMT
factors in MLECs (37), and we found that TGFb (TGFb2 in
particular), but not HGF, were highly upregulated in AIP1-KO
MLEC (Supplementary Fig. S8E). Pretreatment of MLECs with
VEGFR2 TKI completely blunted TGFb2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S8F), suggesting that the AIP1–VEGFR2 axis

induces tumor angiogenesis and formation of premetastatic niche. Enhanced VEGFR2 activity in vascular EC also stimulates secretion of tumor EMT-promoting
factors (e.g., TGFb2), which directly augment tumor cell EMT phenotypic changes, including upregulation of EZH2 protein, reduction of AIP1 protein, increases
in NF-kB activity, and NF-kB–dependent IL6 expression. Together, AIP1-deﬁceint niche promotes tumor invasion and metastasis.

directly regulates TGFb2 expression. We then determined the
functional important of TGFb2 in mediating the MLEC effect
on tumor EMT responses. Coculture of AIP1-KO MLECs
induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and upregulation of
EZH2 with a reciprocal reduction of AIP1 expression in
168FARN cells (Fig. 7G). Moreover, knockdown of TGFb2 in
AIP1-KO MLECs attenuated the EMT responses in 168FARN
cells, including p-Smad2/3, upregulation of EZH2, downregulation of AIP1 and EMT morphologic switch (Fig. 7G and H),
supporting a role of MLEC-secreted TGFb2 in mediating crosstalk between MELCs and tumor cells.

Discussion
In the present study, by implanting tumor cells with the same
genetic background into normal and AIP1-deﬁcient (AIP1-ecKO)
mice, we have deﬁned the role of AIP1 in tumor microenvironment in regulating tumor growth and metastasis. Loss of AIP1 in
vascular ECs is sufﬁcient to augment tumor growth and metastasis
in subcutaneous melanoma and orthotopic breast cancer models.
AIP1 in the vascular EC limits tumor metastases appears to be at a
step(s) before entrance into the bloodstream as a direct i.v.
injection of tumor cells results in no differences in tumor metastasis between WT and AIP1-ecKO mice. Indeed, AIP1 deletion in
the vascular EC enhances VEGFR2 signaling; this enhanced
VEGFR2 not only regulates tumor angiogenesis and premetastatic
niche formation in distant tissues, but also directly modulates
tumor cell EMT phenotypic switch (Fig. 7I: Model for the role of
AIP1 in tumor niche in regulating tumor EMT and metastasis).
Mechanistically, we have deﬁned a novel mechanism by which
AIP1 blocks VEGFR2-dependent signaling, that is, AIP1 through a
lysine-cluster sequence within the C2 domain binds to the phosphotyrosine residues 1054/1059 within the activation loop of
VEGFR2; the VEGFR2 activity in vascular EC is critical for gene
expression of tumor EMT-promoting factors (e.g., TGFb2), which
directly augment tumor cell EMT phenotypic changes, including
upregulation of EZH2 protein, reduction of AIP1 protein,
increases in NF-kB activity, and NF-kB–dependent IL6 expression.
It has been well established that EZH2 epigenetically regulates
AIP1 expression in various tumor cells in vivo and in vitro, and
EZH2-mediated AIP1 downregulation is critical for tumor cell
EMT and metastasis (9, 12). Our data support that the upregulation of EZH2 with AIP1 reduction in tumor cells is a key mechanism by which tumor niche (vascular ECs) induce tumor EMT
and metastasis. Consistently, AIP1-KO MLECs have less effect on
the EMT responses of more malignant tumor cells with high
EZH2/low AIP1 (e.g., 4T1 cells). Taken together, our data support
that AIP1 in tumor microenvironment limits tumor metastasis by
suppressing tumor cell EMT, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor
premetastatic niche formation.
It is well known that TAMs are associated with tumor EMT
and metastasis (38). However, our studies indicate that AIP1 is
abundantly expressed in tumor ECs, but not in TAMs. Moreover, vascular EC-speciﬁc deletion of AIP1 augments tumor
angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. Therefore, AIP1 in vascular ECs limits tumor growth and metastasis. Our data support
that the AIP1 suppresses VEGFR2 in vascular EC to limit tumor
angiogenesis and formation of premetastatic niche formation
as well as tumor cell EMT switch. VEGFR2 signaling is increased
in the both primary tumor and lung tissues of AIP1-ecKO in
response to subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor implantations.

A VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor or a neutralizing antibody abrogates
the augmented VEGFR2-dependent signaling, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis in AIP1-ecKO mice. In vitro, AIP1VEGFR2 signaling in vascular EC directly mediates tumor cell
EMT switch, at least partly by regulating EMT factor TGFb2.
Taken together, we have uncovered a novel pathway—AIP1VEGFR2-TGFb in tumor niche and EZH2-AIP1-NF-kB in tumor
cells—that mediates crosstalk between tumor niche and tumor
cells (Fig. 7I).
AIP1 has been shown to mediate cytokine (e.g., TNF)-induced
EC apoptosis (14–17). EC death and/or proliferation under
inﬂammatory tumor microenvironment can have strong inﬂuence on tumor angiogenesis, and hence tumor growth and on
tumor metastasis (5, 8, 39). We have assessed EC apoptosis and
proliferation in AIP1-ecKO mice. Speciﬁcally, we have performed
immunostaining on sections of tumors and lungs from AIP1-KO
animals for proliferation marker Ki-67 and apoptotic marker
cleaved caspase-3. Our data indicate that AIP1-ecKO mice exhibit
increased EC proliferation with decreased EC apoptosis in the
primary tumor, but not in the lung tissues at 2 weeks postimplantation (Supplementary Fig. S9). These data suggest that
increased EC proliferation with reduced EC apoptosis in AIP1ecKO may contribute to augmented tumor angiogenesis that
enhance growth and metastasis, at least in the primary tumor.
We observe increased VEGFR2 signaling in both primary tumor
and lung tissue, highlighting the important function of VEGFR2
signaling in primary tumor angiogenesis and premetastatic niche
formation in distant tissues. This is further supported by the
VEGFR2 inhibitor experiments presented in our study.
A signiﬁcant mechanistic ﬁnding in this study is that we have
uncovered how AIP1 inhibits VEGFR2 signaling. VEGF primarily
utilizes its receptor VEGFR2 (also Flk-1 or KDR) to induce angiogenic responses by activating a variety of signaling cascades,
including activation of PI3K–Akt, phospholipase C-gamma
(PLC-g), and MAP kinase (40). Given the critical role of VEGFR2
signaling in angiogenesis, VEGFR2 activity/activation needs to be
tightly regulated and ﬁne-tuned. VEGFR2 activity is regulated by
direct interactions with other proteins, including its coreceptor
neuropilins, adhesion molecule VE-cadherin, and integrins.
VEGFR2 could also be negatively regulated. E3 ubiquitin ligase
c-Cbl and SCFbTRCP-dependent ubiquitination could induce
VEGFR2 degradation (41–43). A high cell density-enhanced
phosphatase (DEP-1) is associated with VEGFR2-VE–cadherin–
catenin complex at cell–cell contacts and reduces VEGFR2 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 signaling (44). Therefore, increased
VEGFR2 intracellular trafﬁcking could prevent activated VEGFR2
from inactivation by phosphatases (45–47). We have previously
identiﬁed several VEGFR2 modulators that directly regulate the
formation, activation and stability of the VEGFR2 receptor signaling complex—two positive regulators Bmx (bone marrow
tyrosine kinase located in X-chromosome, a nonreceptor tyrosine
kinase) and CCM3 (cerebral cavernous malformation-3 (CCM3),
and two negative regulators AIP1 and endocytic adaptor protein
Epsin (15, 21, 48, 49). Our study has deﬁned the intriguing
mechanism by which AIP1 binds to active form of VEGFR2 and
inhibits its signaling, that is, AIP1 via its lysine-cluster sequence
within the C2 domain directly binds to the phosphotyrosines
(pY1054/1059) within the activation loop of VEGFR2. We have
provided strong evidence to support our conclusion: The kinasedead mutant (VEGFR2-K868M) and the Y1054/1059F mutant
abolish both VEGFR2 autophosphorylation at pY1054/1059 and

the AIP1 binding. In contrast, mutations of other tyrosine residues
(Y1175, Y1214, or Y801) have no effects on VEGFR2 autophosphorylation at Y1054/1059 and the VEGFR2-AIP1 interactions. A
phosphorylated pY1054/1059 peptide, but not a nonphosphorylated Y1054/1059 peptide, disrupts the VEGFR2-AIP1 association. Similarly, the C2-peptide derived from the lysine-cluster 1 of
AIP1 C2 domain also disrupts the VEGFR2-AIP1 association. On
the basis of the published crystal structure for the VEGFR2 kinase
domain, the pY1054/1059 are exposed on surface and are accessible to protein interactions (50). Likewise, sequence alignment
and structure-based homology modeling of AIP1 C2 domain
suggests that the basic patches are surface exposed. Therefore, it
is possible that the VEGFR2–AIP1 interactions are mediated by
electrostatic interactions. Given that AIP1 via its C2 domain
directly binds to the autoactivation loop of VEGFR2, it is plausible
that AIP1 directly inhibits the VEGFR2 kinase activity. We have
previously shown that AIP1 can recruit PP2A phosphatase to
ASK1 to dephosphorylate a negative phosphorserine-967 site,
leading to ASK1 activation (51). Another possibility is that AIP1
recruits phosphatase(s) to VEGFR2 activation loop to terminate
VEGFR2 signaling and this model needs to be further tested.
Nevertheless, we have revealed a novel function of the AIP1–
VEGFR2 complex. Besides the EC intrinsic function of AIP1VEGFR2 signaling, AIP1-VEGFR2 in tumor niche (e.g., vascular
EC) also regulates tumor cell EMT phenotype through a nonautonomous manner. Speciﬁcally, we show that the AIP1–VEGFR2
signaling in tumor niche cells, by regulating gene expression of
EMT factors (e.g., TGFb2), modulates EZH2-AIP-NF-kB–dependent EMT cascade in tumor cells (Fig. 7I).
Taken together, our results suggest that downregulation of AIP1
expression in tumor niche may be a potential biomarker for tumor
malignancy, and stabilization and/or re-expression of AIP1 in

tumor niche may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of cancer metastasis.
