ABSTRACT
The three oncogenes, ErbB receptors, Ras proteins and nucleolin may contribute
to malignant transformation. Previously, we demonstrated that nucleolin could bind
both Ras protein and ErbB receptors. We also showed that the crosstalk between
the three proteins facilitates anchorage independent growth and tumor growth in
nude mice, and that inhibition of this interaction in prostate and colon cancer cells
reduces tumorigenicity. In the present study, we show that treatment with Ras and
nucleolin inhibitors reduces the oncogenic effect induced by ErbB1 receptor in U87-MG
cells. This combined treatment enhances cell death, reduces cell proliferation and cell
migration. Moreover, we demonstrate a pivotal role of nucleolin in ErbB1 activation
by its ligand. Nucleolin inhibitor prevents EGF-induced receptor activation and its
downstream signaling followed by reduced proliferation. Furthermore, inhibition
of Ras by Salirasib (FTS), mainly reduces cell viability and motility. The combined
treatment, which targets both Ras and nucleolin, additively reduces tumorigenicity
both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that targeting both nucleolin and Ras
may represent an additional opportunity for inhibiting cancers, including glioblastoma,
that are driven by these oncogenes.

INTRODUCTION

cell proliferation, differentiation, motility and death [3].
Signals transmitted by activated Ras induce activation
of multiple pathways [3-5]. Although Ras mutations are
rare in glioblastoma [6], Ras can be activated by ErbB1,
which is often over expressed in these tumors. Therefore,
targeting Ras activation can potentially reduce malignancy.
S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS; also known
as Salirasib) is a synthetic Ras inhibitor that structurally
resembles the carboxy-terminal farnesylcysteine group
common to all Ras proteins. FTS acts as a Ras antagonist
in cells and thereby reduces cellular Ras content [7].
Nucleolin is a ubiquitously expressed acidic
phosphoprotein with key functions in transcription,
synthesis and maturation of ribosomes [8, 9]. Nucleolin is
involved in regulation of cell proliferation and cell growth
[10, 11]. It is localized primarily in the nucleoli, but it
is also found in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface of
some types of cells [9, 12-14]. Nucleolin over expression

Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive class of tumors
with hallmark features that include proliferation, genetic
instability and chemoresistance [1]. Thus, the treatment
of glioblastoma remains a challenging question. Several
studies have identified epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR also known as ErbB1/HER1) and its downstream
signaling molecules as unregulated in glioblastoma [2].
Amplification of ErbB1 and alteration of its activity are
important contributors to glioblastoma development
[2]. Therefore, identification of proteins that regulate
ErbB1 activation, degradation or part of its downstream
signaling, may promote the development of new targeted
therapy. Among the downstream effectors of ErbB1 is the
Ras signaling pathway. The Ras family of small GTPases
can transmit extracellular signals, which are initiated by
the ErbB1, to regulate various cellular processes including

is related with increased cell proliferation. Cell surface
nucleolin is found in a wide range of tumor cells, and it is
used as a marker for cancer diagnosis [15, 16]. Increased
levels of cytoplasmic and cell-surface nucleolin have been
demonstrated to correlate with malignancy grade and
proliferation rate in glioblastoma [15]. Inhibition of cellsurface nucleolin and nucleolin activities, suppresses the
growth of various cancer cells that may also express high
levels/or activated Ras protein [8, 17-19]. In our previous
studies, we identified non-nucleolar nucleolin as an ErbB
receptor-interacting protein [20-23]. This interaction
leads to ErbB1/EGFR receptor activation as well as to
colony growth in soft agar [20]. In addition, recently we
identified a crosstalk between nucleolin, ErbB1 and Ras
proteins [22]. More recently, we have demonstrated that
treatment of colon and prostate cancer cells with FTS
and GroA (AS1411) inhibited cell growth and anchorage
independent growth [24]. In the present study, we used
U87-MG glioblastoma cells to examine the impact of Ras
and nucleolin inhibition on ErbB1 and on the crosstalk
between these three oncogenes. We demonstrated a pivotal
role of nucleolin in activation of ErbB1 with or without
its ligand EGF, in glioma cells. We showed that GroA
(nucleolin inhibitor) reduced ErbB1/nucleolin interaction,
affected EGF-induced ErbB1 activation and facilitated
the degradation of ErbB1. In addition, GroA treatment
significantly inhibited cell proliferation whereas FTS
treatment increased cell death. Furthermore, the combined
treatment of GroA and FTS inhibited cell growth, induced
cell death and reduced cell motility. Moreover, the same
treatments exhibited similar effects in vivo, namely, the
combined treatment reduced ErbB1 phosphorylation
and ErbB1/nucleolin interactions, induced cell death and
reduced tumor volume in nude mice.

The effect of FTS and GroA on ErbB1
phosphorylation and ErbB1/nucleolin interaction
U87-MG cells express high levels of ErbB1
receptor and cell surface nucleolin [2]. Previously we
have demonstrated a crosstalk between Ras, nucleolin and
ErbB1 [21-24]. In order to test the effect of nucleolin and
Ras inhibition on ErbB1 phosphorylation in glioblastoma
cells, we used two inhibitors: FTS (salirasib) [25-27], a
powerful Ras inhibitor, and GroA (AS1411), an aptamer
that targets cell surface nucleolin [8, 28-30]. Cells were

with FTS 75µM, GroA 10µM or both for 48 hr, followed by
EGF (100ng/ml) treatment for 30 min. Cell lysates were

anti ErbB1 or with anti nucleolin Abs. As a control, total cell
lysates were immunoblotted with anti ErbB1, anti nucleolin or
anti-actin Abs. B. Cells were treated with GroA 10µM for 48 hr,

three times with similar results. C. lysates were precipitated with
anti-PY20 and blotted with anti-ErbB1 antibodies. As a control,

treated or untreated with FTS or GroA for 48 hr and then
treated with or without EGF for 30 min. Cell lysates were
subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-nucleolin
antibodies and blotted with anti ErbB1 antibodies. As
shown, treatment with each drug alone or in combination
reduced the interaction between the two proteins (Figure
1A). Furthermore, EGF increased the interaction between
ErbB1 and nucleolin, whereas, GroA treatment alone
or in combination with FTS treatment, inhibited EGFinduced elevation of ErbB1 and nucleolin interaction.
Since GroA treatment affected ErbB1/nucleolin
interaction with or without EGF, we next examined the
time course of EGF-induced receptor degradation. As
shown in Figure 1B, receptor degradation was enhanced
by GroA treatment. Furthermore, as shown in Figure
1C, GroA treatment with or without FTS inhibited EGF-

induced ErbB1 phosphorylation, which suggests that the
interaction between the two proteins has a functional
role. Thus, inhibition of cell surface nucleolin may affect
its interaction with ErbB1 as well as the ligand-induced
ErbB1 degradation or phosphorylation.

FTS and GroA effect on MAPK and PKB/AKT
signaling pathways
Since inhibition of nucleolin and Ras affected
receptor phosphorylation and receptor degradation, we
next examined the combined effect of the drugs on ErbB1
downstream signaling (Figure 2). Two main pathways
activated by ErbB1 and Ras are the mitogen activated
protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (Akt/PKB).

Figure 2: Ras and nucleolin inhibition reduces p-MAPK and p-PKB levels. U87-MG cells were treated with FTS 75μM,

GroA 10μM or both for 48 hr, followed by EGF (100ng/ml) treatment for 30 min (A and C). A. Total cell lysates were analyzed by western
blot using anti p-MAPK. As a control, total cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti- MAPK. B. Cells were treated with FTS 75μM and
GroA 10μM following staining with anti- pMAPK and actin (using phalloidin-rhodamine). Fluorescence levels were quantified by image

and actin staining using phalloidin-rhodamine. Fluorescence levels were quantified by image J and were compared to the control (100%).

Combination of both drugs significantly inhibited both
downstream pathways as detected either by Western blot
or by immunostaining (Figure 2). Cells were treated with
and without GroA in the presence or in the absence of
FTS for 48 hr and then treated with EGF for 30 min. As
shown, inhibition of Ras and nucleolin together reduced
EGF-induced MAPK (Figure 2A) and PKB (Figure 2C)
activation more effectively compared to each of the
treatments alone. As demonstrated by immunostaining
using anti-phosphorylated MAPK (Figure 1B) and
PKB (Figure 1D), the activation of these pathways
was significantly reduced. Moreover, co-staining with
phalloidin, which stains actin filaments, demonstrated that

the combined treatment affected cell morphology. Treated
cells became more flattened and contained stress fibers
(Figure 2B and D). Hence, the combined treatment can
effectively inhibit Ras downstream signaling pathways,
which may affect cell proliferation and viability.

The effect of FTS and GroA on cell proliferation
In order to test the effect of nucleolin and Ras
inhibition on cell growth and viability we first examined
the ability of FTS and GroA to reduce the number of cells
as determined by the methylene blue assay (Figure 3A).
As shown, FTS and GroA each reduced the number of

was assayed after 3 days of treatment by BrdU incorporation (B and C) and Ki67 staining (D and E). In each field the percentage of

live cells, while the combined treatment was significantly
more effective than each of the treatments alone. Since
the number of cells was reduced following treatment, we
further asked whether the drugs influence cell proliferation
or cell death. Therefore, we examined cell proliferation
using the Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation
assay (Figure 3B and C). As shown, each treatment
alone inhibited BrdU incorporation, but the GroA , as
well as the combined treatments, were significantly more
effective compared to FTS treatment alone (Figure 3C).
Moreover, proliferation mediated by EGF was almost
completely blocked by GroA treatment. This highlights
the role of nucleolin as a regulator of cell proliferation
via EGF-dependent ErbB1 activation. Similar results were
also obtained by using the proliferation marker Ki67,
which labels cells during the different phases of the cell
cycle (Figure 3D and 3E). The combined treatment was
significantly more effective in inhibition of cell growth
compared to FTS treatment alone. However, there was no

significant difference between the combined treatment and
GroA treatment alone. This may suggest that GroA has a
strong inhibitory effect on cell proliferation.

The effect of FTS and GroA on cell death
As described above, FTS and GroA co-treatment
reduces cell number, which may result from cell growth
inhibition but also from enhanced cell death. To determine
the degree of cell death induced by the combined treatment
we used the Hoechst dye exclusion assay, 3 days following
treatments. As shown, we observed enhanced cell death
following FTS treatment which was further increased
when combined with GroA treatment as indicated (Figure
4A). As a positive control for cell death induction, we
used staurosporine, a known apoptotic inducer. To further
investigate cell death, we examined whether it is caspase
dependent (Figure 4B and C). As shown, active caspase
3 levels were significantly elevated following FTS

results suggest that most of the cell death observed in the
combined treatment is mediated by FTS.

cell viability and cell density. Taken together, these results
demonstrate drugs synergism on U87-MG xenograft
growth inhibition, which are in agreement with the in vitro
results showing that GroA inhibits proliferation and FTS
induces apoptosis.

The effect of FTS and GroA on cell migration

DISCUSSION

In order to study the effect of the treatments on cell
motility, scratch-induced migration assay was employed
[31, 32]. Results of a representative experiment are
presented in Figure 5. As shown, both FTS and GroA
treatments significantly inhibited the gap closure, with
stronger effect induced by FTS treatment. However, the
combined treatment exhibited a significantly greater effect
compared to each of the treatments alone. These results
suggest that, each of the drugs inhibit cell migration, and
with better effectiveness when combined.

Glioblastoma are among the most lethal and
untreatable types of human adult cancer. Glioblastoma
have several genetic and signaling abnormalities that
lead to uncontrolled growth, invasiveness, angiogenesis,
and eventually facilitate cell proliferation and survival
[33, 34]. The impairment of signaling pathways provided
the basis for designing molecular-targeted therapy for
treatment of glioblastoma. The epidermal growth factor

FTS and GroA effect on tumor growth in vivo
Since FTS and GroA treatments affected cell
proliferation and viability, we next wanted to examine
whether the treatment has similar effects on tumor growth
in nude mice that were xenografted with U87-MG cells in
vivo. The four groups of mice (8 per group) received 2.5
x 106 cells subcutaneously in the flank. Tumor volumes
were monitored every two days. When the tumor reached
the volume of approximately 140mm3, the mice were
randomly divided into four groups; each group was treated
with either Cro (oligomer control) + CMC (FTS vehicle),
FTS+Cro, GroA+CMC, or FTS+GroA (Figure 6). Twenty
days after treatments, the tumors in the groups treated
with GroA, FTS and both were significantly smaller then
those observed in the control (Cro+CMC) treated mice
(Figure 6A). In agreement with the in vitro studies, lysates
prepared from the tumors showed that the combined
treatment reduced nucleolin/ErbB1 interaction as well as
ErbB1 phosphorylation at 12 days and at 20 days following
treatment (Fig 6 B and C respectively). These results
support the conclusion that Ras and nucleolin synergize
in receptor activation, which may be related to induction
of cell transformation. Furthermore, cell proliferation was
inhibited and cell death was enhanced in the combined
treatment as evident by immunostaining of the tumor
sections with Ki67 and caspase 3 antibodies (Figure 6
D and 6E, respectively). Analysis of tissue morphology
depicted by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) staining of
the tumor sections revealed that, as opposed to the control
sections where cells looked dense and viable, the GroA
sections showed reduced cell density with empty spaces.
Furthermore, FTS sections showed apoptotic nuclei, while
the combined treatment enhanced the effect of each of the
drugs alone, exhibiting condensed nuclei and no defined
cell structure (Figure 6F). Of note, although there is no
significant difference between the treatments in tumor size
there are apparent differences in the tissue morphology,

receptor (EGFR)/ErbB1 gene amplification is one of
the most frequent alterations, occurring in 30–40% of
malignant glioblastoma and it has been associated with
tumor invasiveness, angiogenesis, poor survival, and
resistance to radiation therapy [35]. ErbB1 activates
signaling cascades leading to cell proliferation and it
is considered as an attractive target for cancer therapy
[36]. Active Ras–dependent pathways are also abundant
in most glioblastoma multiform, [37] and contribute to
the malignant phenotype by disrupting cell cycle arrest,

increasing cell migration, enhancing cell survival, and
promoting angiogenesis [38, 39]. The increased presence
of active Ras-GTP in glioblastoma is secondary to
mitogenic signals originating from activated receptor
tyrosine kinases [40]. Nucleolin is highly expressed in
glioblastoma and it was shown previously that knocking
down nucleolin in glioblastoma cells could inhibit tumor
growth and induce cell arrest [15].
In our earlier studies, we have identified a functional
crosstalk between Ras, nucleolin and ErbB1 [22, 24]. In

MATERIALS AND METHODS

the present study we examined the effect of two drugs,
directed towards Ras and nucleolin proteins, as a tool to
disrupt the synergism between these three oncogenes as a
potential treatment for glioblastoma. To target nucleolin
we used GroA, and to target Ras, we used FTS. We
found a pivotal role of nucleolin in enhancing ErbB1
stabilization, activation and therefore cell proliferation
in glioblastoma. Moreover, the combined treatment that
targeted nucleolin and Ras (GroA and FTS, respectively)
reduced cell growth and viability, more effectively than
treatment with each drug alone. GroA mainly inhibited cell
proliferation, while FTS induced cell death. Cell motility
was inhibited mainly by FTS with smaller contribution of
GroA treatment. These results suggest that both drugs can
affect different cellular pathways, as they induce different
biological responses. Thus a combined treatment may be
more efficient in inhibition of glioblastoma cell growth.
Previously, it was demonstrated that FTS attenuates
glioblastoma cells by inhibiting both their migration and
their anchorage-independent proliferation. The main
effect of FTS treatment was mediated by inhibition of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling [32]. It was also
demonstrated that knocking down nucleolin expression
inhibits glioblastoma tumor growth [41]. In agreement
with these findings, our study suggests a benefit of
the combined treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Each
treatment affects slightly different biological responses;
FTS mainly affects cell migration and cell viability
whereas GroA mainly affects cell proliferation. Moreover,
the combined treatment inhibits cell viability, migration
and cell proliferation significantly more efficiently than
each treatment alone. In addition, the combined treatment
inhibits Erk and PKB signaling pathways more effectively
than each of the treatments alone. Furthermore, in the in
vivo experiments, although in the combined treatment the
sizes of the tumors were similar to those of the single drug
treatments, we found that there was substantial altered
tumor morphology. In the combined treatment, the tissue
density was reduced with many dead cell regions. This
may strengthen the possibility that the combined treatment
has a better potential to inhibit tumor cell growth and
viability. Taken together, these results are extremely
important in light of the absence of drug treatment in brain
tumors that express high ErbB1 levels and nucleolin.
In conclusion, our results indicate that treatment
with a combination of drugs that target the cooperation
between these oncogenes better inhibits tumor cell growth.
The combination of FTS and GroA reduces receptor levels
and activation, thus inhibiting signaling downstream
to the receptor affecting tumorigenicity. These results
highlight the superior effect of the combined treatment.
Furthermore, our study suggests a new and possibly more
effective way to treat cancer patients that overexpressed
these oncogenes.

Immunohistochemistry

U87-MG cells were plated into 10cm culture dish
at 1×106 cells in phenol DMEM supplemented with 5%
FCS, 24hr before treatment. After treatment, cells were
lysed and protein concentration was determined using
Bradford assay (BioRad). Equal amount of protein was
taken for each immunoprecipitation or immunoblot. For
immunoprecipitation, monoclonal antibodies were first
coupled to anti-mouse IgG agarose (Sigma), for 30 min
at 4°C, then the proteins in the lysate supernatant were
immunoprecipitated with aliquots of the beads-antibody
complexes for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates
were washed with HNTG buffer, resolved by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) through 7.5%
gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane. For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of
protein from each sample were loaded and resolved by
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 7.5%10% gels. The gels were electrophoretically transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked,
blotted with the corresponding primary antibodies
followed by secondary antibody linked to horseradish
peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were detected by
chemiluminescence reaction. The protein levels were
quantified by a densitometric analysis of protein bands
using the ImageJ software.

U87-MG cells were seeded on coverslips coated with
poly-L-Lysine in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. The
cells were then stimulated with the indicated treatments
and time and fixed with 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) for
10 min followed by incubation in blocking solution (PBSTriton X-100 containing 5% normal goat serum; Jackson
immunoreaserch) for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary
antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and cells were
incubated for 1 hr in room temperature. After washing,
cells were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with
secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Cells
were mounted in Fluoromount (Dako).

Microscopy
Cells were examined under a fluorescence
microscope at 10× to 60×magnification (as indicated) with
Olympus motorized inverted research microscope Model
IX81. Average fluorescent intensity after immunostaining
against p-MAPK and p-PKB were quantified using
ImageJ.

Scratch-induced migration assay

Assays of cell survival and cell death

Cells were plated in six-well plates. Two days after
treatment, by the time confluency was reached, a scratch
wound was inflicted at each well. 24 hour later, the cells
were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, followed by nuclei
labeled with DAPI. The resulting gap was imaged and cell
number in the scratch was quantified.

U87-MG cells were plated in medium supplemented
with 5% FBS, treated with or without FTS, GroA or Cro
for the indicated time. Cell numbers were determined
by the methylene blue assay. For this purpose, the cells
were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered
saline for 2 hours, then washed once with 0.1 M boric
acid (pH 8.5) and incubated with the DNA-binding
dye methylene blue (1% in boric acid) for 20 minutes
at room temperature. The cells were then washed and
lysed with 0.1 M HCl. Absorbance was measured with a
Tecan Spectrafluor Plus spectrophotometer (Mannedorf,
Switzerland) at 595 nm. Cell viability was calculated
as the ratio of absorbance in treated cultures to that in
untreated control cultures. Nuclear staining and nuclear
morphology scored dead cells. To estimate the number
of dying cells, live cells were incubated for 5 minutes
with 1μg/ml of the fluorescent DNA dye bisbenzimide
(Hoechst 33258; Sigma). As a positive control, the cells
were treated with 200 nM STS (staurosphorine). After
staining, the cells were photographed with an Olympus

BrdU-positive cell counts
Cells were examined under a fluorescence
microscope at 20×magnification with Olympus motorized
inverted research microscope. In each field (15-20 fields
for each treatment) the percentage of proliferating cells
was estimated by counting the BrdU-positive cells relative
to the total number of cells (DAPI labeled). (100–300 cells
per field), and expressing the result as a percentage of the
BrdU- positive cell number.

Tumor Growth in Nude Mice

This work was supported by the Israel Science
Foundation (Grant no. 848/12), by the Israel Cancer
Association and by the Kauffman Prostate Cancer
Research Fund. SST is supported by the Buchmann
scholarship fund.

The study was conducted according to the NIH
Guidelines for Use and Care of Laboratory Animals and
following the approval by Animal Care Committee of the
Tel Aviv University. U87-MG cells were implanted into
nude nice. Nude CD1-Nu mice (25-30 g) were housed in
barrier facilities on a 12-h light/dark cycle.
On day zero, 2.5 ×106 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS were
implanted subcutaneously just above the right femoral
joint. Tumor size was measured every 4 days. When the
tumors were apparently seen and the calculated tumor
size was 140 mm3, the animals were divided randomly
into four groups of mice (control, FTS treatment, GroA
treatment and combined treatment; 8 mice per group).
GroA treatment was performed by intraperitoneal injection
of 4.5 mg/kg in 100 μl PBS (or 4.5 mg/kg Cro in 100 μl
PBS for control mice) every other day. FTS was orally
administered daily at 60 mg/kg, and was prepared in
H2O/0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC; or H2O/0.5%
CMC for control mice). Tumor volumes were monitored
on the indicated days as described previously [42]. At the
end of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed and the
tumors were dissected and used for protein analysis and
immunohistochemistry.

Tumor analysis
Every tumor was cut in half with a scalpel
blade; half was taken for protein analysis and half for
immunohistochemistry and histology. For protein analysis,
tumors were homogenized by a polytron homogenizer in
lysis buffer, immunoblot and immunopercipitations were
done as described above. For immunostaining tumors
were post-fixed for 3 hours in cold 4% PFA followed
by 20% sucrose in PBS overnight at 40C. Cryostat
sections (20 µm) were cut and stained using standard
immunohistochemistry as described above. Primary
antibodies: rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:300, Thermo Scientific),
rabbit anti-active caspase 3 (1:1000, R&D Systems).
Standard protocol was used for H&E staining.
