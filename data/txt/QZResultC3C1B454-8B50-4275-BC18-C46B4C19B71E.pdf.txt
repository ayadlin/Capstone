Abstract
Acquired drug resistance is a primary obstacle for effective cancer therapy.
The correlation of point mutations in class III β-tubulin (TUBB3) and the prominent
overexpression of ATP-binding cassette P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), a multidrug resistance
gene, have been protruding mechanisms of resistance to microtubule disruptors such
as paclitaxel (PTX) for many cancers. However, the precise underlying mechanism
of the rapid onset of cross-resistance to an array of structurally and functionally
unrelated drugs in PTX-resistant cancers has been poorly understood. We determined
that our established PTX-resistant cancer cells display ABCB1/ABCC1-associated
cross-resistance to chemically different drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, docetaxel,
and cisplatin. We found that feedback activation of TUBB3 can be triggered through
the FOXO3a-dependent regulation of ABCB1, which resulted in the accentuation of
induced PTX resistance and encouraged multiplicity in acquired cross-resistance.
FOXO3a-directed regulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function suggests that control
of ABCB1 involves methylation-dependent activation. Consistently, transcriptional
overexpression or downregulation of FOXO3a directs inhibitor-controlled proteasedegradation of TUBB3. The functional PI3K/Akt signaling is tightly responsive to
FOXO3a activation alongside doxorubicin treatment, which directs FOXO3a arginine
hypermethylation. In addition, we found that secretome factors from PTX-resistant
cancer cells with acquired cross-resistance support a P-gp-dependent association
in multidrug resistance (MDR) development, which assisted the FOXO3a-mediated
control of TUBB3 feedback. The direct silencing of TUBB3 reverses induced multiple
cross-resistance, reduces drug-resistant tumor mass, and suppresses the impaired
microtubule stability status of PTX-resistant cells with transient cross-resistance.
These findings highlight the control of the TUBB3 response to ABCB1 genetic
suppressors as a mechanism to reverse the profuse development of multidrug
resistance in cancer.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters bound in the cell
membrane compartments. The overexpression of ABC
transcription correlates with an increase in patient relapse
during or following treatment with various chemotherapy
drugs [1, 2]. Paclitaxel (PTX), an anticancer drug against
various human solid tumors, primarily targets microtubules
(mt) to disrupt mitosis, motility, and the growth of cells.
PTX-resistant cancers highlight the rapid onset of multiple
cross-resistance and the high percentage of failures even
in therapies that involve drug combinations. Alterations in
tubulin-isoform expression alongside the overexpression of
energy-driven P-glycoprotein (P-gp; encoded by ABCB1)
are well-known causative factors of taxane-refractory
tumors. Mt-targeting agents such as PTX and its synthetic
analogue docetaxel (DCT) bind to the β-subunit in the
αβ-tubulin dimer, which exemplifies the stability of the
mt assembly [3, 4]. In several cancers, class III β-tubulin
(encoded by TUBB3) is a predictive biomarker of clinical
PTX resistance and a DCT-based chemotherapy response
[5]. A number of factors are involved in the concession
of mt-targeted therapies including the patient’s β-tubulin
isotype differential expression profile in various tissues/
organs and the modifications in tubulin-binding sites,
mt assembly properties, tubulin synthesis, and tubulin
polymerization. Dynamic equilibrium between soluble
tubulin dimers are maintained by microtubule-associated
proteins (MAPs) collectively known as microtubule inner
proteins (MIPs), which include proteins that are intact with
tubulin heterodimers. This specific occasion of equipoise is
often targeted by PTX but is altered in several malignancies
[6, 7]. Conflicting results and inconsistencies have
previously been identified in both in vitro and in vivo models
of the mechanism of MAPs in drug resistance, which
suggests that there is much work remaining to elucidate the
precise mechanisms of action.
A rapidly growing paradigm is that targeted therapies
require factors that can overcome the spontaneous mutations
in β-tubulin isotypes to reverse resistance to PTX and other
taxanes [8]. Therefore, designing small molecule drugs and
testing rationale drug combinations that can target specific
β-tubulin isotype modifications to reverse P-gp-mediated
resistance are warranted; however, this is very challenging
because structurally, the seven isotypes of β-tubulin have
complex differential functional mechanisms on mt and
play key roles in cellular homeostasis [9]. Therefore, the
discovery of genes that can regulate the feedback control
of β-tubulin isotypes associated with drug sensitivity is
necessary to provide a rationale platform for both MDR
biomarkers and therapeutic discoveries.
Forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factors
such as FOXO3a have recently been identified as key
players in the initiation of cancer and the development of
drug resistance. The anticancer drug-mediated up-regulation
of FOXO3a enhances ABCB1 expression, which may
directly contribute to the genesis of MDR in general and
to the implicated FOXO activation-mediated chemotherapy

response, including those cytostatic and cytotoxic effects
amended by PTX, DCT, cisplatin (CIS), gefitinib (GEF),
and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [10, 11]. Identified as downstream
targets of the PI3K/Akt pathway, FOXO transcription factors
are associated with tumorigenesis and chemotherapeutic
resistance in several ways, such as through inhibiting the
transactivation of drug-target genes (e.g., p27/Kip1, BclxL, cyclin D, and Bim) involved in cell proliferation,
apoptosis, and differentiation [12]. In addition, because
the overexpression of Akt can increase resistance to PTX,
FOXO transcription factors have since been implicated
in determining drug sensitivity and affecting other signal
transduction pathways that regulate the response to PTX.
Similarly, the MAPK member JNK, specifically its submembers JNK1 and JNK2, augment protection from the
toxic effects of PTX [13, 14]. Furthermore, PTX not only
induces FOXO3a expression but also enhances its nuclear
translocation through a JNK-dependent mechanism and
affects its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Meanwhile,
FOXO3a, aside from affecting PTX actions, regulates the
DNA damage response and stimulates the DNA repair
pathway, which regulates the sensitivity to drugs that target
the DNA repair system such as 5-FU and CIS, among
others [15, 16]. Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and FOXO3a
have been observed to compete in binding to similar DNA
sequences, which often results in antagonized transcriptional
output that has recently been related to genotoxic
drug resistance and the response of various cancers to
chemotherapy [17, 18].
Considerable progress has been made in determining
the mechanism of FOXO-regulated mt organization. Very
recently, FOXO has also been implicated in drug-mediated
cytoskeletal stress because of its effects on neuronal mt
organization following pharmacological damage, which
requires Akt kinase [19, 20]. Importantly, some FOXO
transcription factors also influence the PTX-induced
inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR), suggesting a
connection between the mt-dependent trafficking of the
AR and the clinical efficacy of PTX as well as that of other
taxanes [21]. Although these distinct drug-induced mt
organization regulatory events may suggest a connection
between β-tubulin isotypes such as TUBB3 and FOXO
transcription factors, very little is known about the systemic
relation of these factors and their collective function as
interacting elements in the regulation of the response of
cancers to chemotherapeutic drugs and the malignant
progression of tumors caused by MDR that often leads to
cancer recurrence.
Herein, in light of the increasing demand to
uncover drug resistance mechanisms, we dissected the
function of FOXO3a-mediated ABCB1 in regulating
TUBB3 feedback in the context of the development of
multiple cross-resistance to chemically unrelated cancer
chemotherapeutics in PTX-resistant cancer cells, and
we extended this event to systemic drug-resistant tumor
progression.

RESULTS

cells and H292 and A549 lung cells. The expressions of
both TUBB3 and FOXO3a were the highest in cancer cells
with derived PTX and GEF resistance. In PacR cancer cells,
TUBB3 expression had > 2.8 and > 1.3 fold increases while
FOXO3a had > 2.8 and > 1.0 fold increases when compared
to both drug-sensitive normal and cancer cells, respectively.
A Western blot analysis also exhibited the same expression
patterns of both genes including FOXO3a phosphorylation
(Figure 1A, 1B), which showed relatively higher expressions
in drug-resistant variants. Furthermore, the level of ABCB1
gene expression was confirmed to be several-fold higher in
drug-resistant cancer cells compared to normal and parental
cells, which confirms the high level of drug resistance in
these cells (Figure 1C). Higher P-gp expression in drugresistant cancer cells compared to their parent cells was
clearly demonstrated both in protein expression (Figure 1D)
and intracellular distribution (Figure 1E).

ABCB1-associated acquired drug resistance is
correlated with TUBB3 and FOXO3a expression
Given the previous reports that separately associate
drug-induced FOXO3a phosphorylation and TUBB3
alterations with the overexpression of ABCB1 [5, 11], we
sought to examine the transcription and protein expression
patterns of TUBB3 and FOXO3a in a panel of non-tumor
(normal cell), drug-sensitive cancer, and drug-resistant
cancer cell models to correlate their expression with MDR
development. A gene expression analysis showed that both
TUBB3 and FOXO3a mRNA levels are relatively lower
in non-cancer RWPE-1 prostate cells, L132 and MRC-5
lung cells, and HEK293 and HUVEC cells whereas their
levels are higher in drug-sensitive cancer PC-3 prostate

PTX-resistant cancer cells display frequent
cross-resistance to DCT, 5-FU, and CIS
associated with high P-gp-mediated drug efflux

others with distinct MRP (ABCC1) overexpression in the
PC-3 subline, as determined by Western blot analysis.
ABCB1-transfected HEK293 cells also displayed crossresistance to 5-FU and DCT but not to CIS. These results
suggest the involvement of P-gp activity in multiple crossresistance in PTX-resistant cancer cells.

Several paclitaxel-resistant cancers have been defined
to have cross-resistance to a variety of chemically unrelated
drugs such as cisplatin, vinblastine, and anthracyclines
[22, 23]. Along with the overexpression of P-gp (ABCB1),
progress in determining other key molecular events that
lead to the onset of multiple cross-resistance in PTXresistant cancers has been greatly hampered [24]. To
investigate the degree and mechanism of cross-resistance
in PTX-resistant cancer cells, we employed our previously
established PTX-resistant sublines, A549-PacR and PC3-PacR cells, and developed transient cross-resistance to
5-FU, DCT, and CIS (see the Experimental Procedures).
First, we identified whether P-gp drug efflux is involved
in the occurrence of cross-resistance to 5-FU, DCT, and
CIS in PTX-resistant cancer cells. Notably, fractions of the
drug intolerant cells following treatment with apoptosisinducing concentrations of the drugs were increased
in PTX-resistant cancer cells and ABCB1-transfected
HEK293 cells, suggesting that P-gp expression is highly
correlated, except to CIS cross-resistance (Figure 2A, 2B).
The number of drug-resistant colonies following exposure
to 5-FU-conditioned media (CM) complemented these
findings (Figure 2C). A549-PacR and HEK293/ABCB1
cells showed very low intracellular accumulation of
Rho-123 dye relative to parental and empty vector (EV)transfected cells (Figure 2D). Paclitaxel resistant (PacR)
cells displayed lower ABCB1 ATPase activity following
DCT and 5-FU treatment compared to DMSO (vehicle)treated control cells, whereas HEK293/ABCB1 cells
induced minimal lowered levels (Figure 2E). Treatment
with 5-FU, DCT, and CIS positively stimulated P-gp
protein expression in A549-PacR and PC-3-PacR cells
(Figure 2F). Moreover, a lower 5-FU concentration
regulated ABCB1 gene expression in A549-PacR and PC3-PacR cells in a strict time-dependent manner whereas
variations in ABCB1 gene expression were observed in
HEK293/ABCB1 cells (Figure 2G). Drug-stimulated P-gpspecific luminescent ATPase activity of both A549-PacR
and PC-3-PacR cells was stimulated in a concentrationdependent manner following 5-FU treatment (Figure 2H).
The cells were then screened for their response to a variety
of chemotherapeutics. Both A549-PacR and PC-3-PacR
cells were found to have frequent cross-resistance to DCT,
5-FU, and CIS whereas H292-GefR cells had minimalfold cross-resistance, as determined by the IC50 values of
incorporated drugs (Table 1). In addition, PacR cancer cells
with developed transient cross-resistance showed increased
resistance relative to both the parental and PacR cells in
all of the drug cases tested. Specifically, PacR cancer cells
with transient 5-FU cross-resistance (-PacR/5-FU) showed
the highest relative resistance and P-gp dependence among

Multiple cross-resistance in PTX-resistant cancer
cells involves regulated TUBB3 and FOXO3a
expressions and supports escape from druginduced apoptosis
The overexpression of TUBB3 has been clinically
implicated in several malignancies with PTX-resistance
[25]; this mechanism appears to be dependent on tubulinmutation-induced decreases in mt stability [26]. Meanwhile,
an Akt-dependent increase of FOXO3a activity was observed
in response to PTX-induced apoptosis and was correlated
with limited mt stability conferring ABCB1-associated drug
resistance [15, 27, 28]. To study the potential phenomenon
of TUBB3 and FOXO3a regulation in the context of PTXresistance and MDR in cancer cells, PTX-resistant cells with
developed transient cross-resistance were analyzed (Figure
3A). Late-passage (p#21) cells were subjected to 5-FU
treatment, which showed the growth inhibition in A549
parental cells in a concentration-dependent manner whereas
A549-PacR cells with developed transient cross-resistance
to 5-FU, DCT, and CIS displayed continued resistance even
at a high concentration treatment with a higher fraction
of cells surviving than just A549-PacR cells (Figure 3B).
To associate this sustained cross-resistance with P-gp,
ABCB1 mRNA levels were determined in late-passage
A549-PacR/5-FU and PC-3-PacR/5-FU cells while being
maintained with very low concentrations of 5-FU overtime.
The cells were harvested at days 0, 5, 10, and 15 subsequent
to cell passage (reaching p#12–14) and subculture
processes after generation and were analyzed for target
gene expression. We found significantly increased levels
of ABCB1 over time (relative to day 0) that were sustained
even at day 15 in both cells. Sustained transient crossresistance to 5-FU in PTX-resistant cells appeared to involve
ABCC1 because the gene levels were slightly increased over
time (Figure 3C). TUBB3 and FOXO3a gene levels were
significantly increased in A549-PacR/5-FU, A549-PacR-/
DCT (Figure 3D), PC-3-PacR/5-FU, and PC-3-PacR-/DCT
(Figure 3E) cells compared to the PacR phenotype only and
were slightly regulated, although an increase was detectable,
in HEK293/ABCB1 cells compared to EV-transfected
cells (Figure 3F). To confirm that the qRT-PCR data were
correlated with increased protein levels, the expressions
of βIII-tubulin, phosphorylated FOXO3a, and P-gp were
determined. Consistent with the findings of gene expression,
the expressions of βIII-tubulin and phosphorylated FOXO3a
were up-regulated in 5-FU and DCT cross-resistant cells
compared to the PacR phenotype only. In addition, all of

the cells also exhibited continued P-gp expression (Figure
3G). In HEK293 cells, the establishment of transient crossresistance to 5-FU and DCT in the ABCB1-overexpressing
subline caused an activation of βIII-tubulin compared to the
minimally down-regulated levels in EV-transfected cells
(Figure 3H). These data suggest that TUBB3 and FOXO3a
play significant roles in conferring cross-resistance in PTXresistant cancers associated with ABCB1.
We observed that 5-FU (40 µM in form of pretreatment) stimulated an escape from etoposide-induced
apoptosis in A549-PacR cells (Supplementary Figure 1).

To functionally examine whether P-gp-associated crossresistance to 5-FU confers apoptosis protection, we
employed the P-gp inhibitor, verapamil. A549-PacR/5-FU
cells showed a reduced fraction of apoptotic cells compared
to A549-PacR cells after treatment with an apoptosisinducing concentration of verapamil (Figure 3I). Of note,
this effect was supported by the expression of apoptotic
biomarkers. Verapamil down-regulated the expressions
of both Bax and p53 and up-regulated the expression of
Bcl-2 in A549-PacR/5-FU cells compared to A549-PacR
cells (Figure 3J). A rapid increase in verapamil-induced

furthermore, FOXO3a enhances βIII-tubulin activation
with an observed 3-fold increased accumulation of TUBB3
turnover (Figure 4C, 4D). This finding suggests that the
effect induced by MG132 pin-points the constitutive
degradation of TUBB3 through its ubiquitination status. We
further examined the status of TUBB3 poly-ubiquitination
in these cells by transfecting the myc-tagged ubiquitin
expression vector. After anti-TUBB3 immunoprecipitation
followed by anti-myc antibody detection, we detected
strikingly high molecular weight smears following MG132
treatment with higher polyubiquitinated levels in FOXO3asiRNA transfected-cells relative to EV transfected cells,
while lower poly-ubiquitination status in non-treated
controls (Figure 4E). These results demonstrate that
FOXO3a strikingly influences the physiological control
of βIII-tubulin, at least in part, by the ubiquitin-proteome
system, which can potentially modulate cross-resistance to
5-FU in PTX-resistant cancer cells.
Frequent aberrant DNA methylation of ABCB1 has
been observed in highly drug-resistant and invasive cancers,
making its hypomethylation-triggering factors desirable
targets for transcription-based inhibition, including the
regulation of histone acetylation to reverse MDR [33, 34].
However, pivotal effectors that regulate ABCB1 methylation
and their precise epigenetic mechanisms have not yet been
well elucidated. To determine whether the DNA methylation
status of ABCB1 is influenced by FOXO3a to effect PTXresistance and MDR, we amplified our designed primers
specific to both methylated and unmethylated alleles of the
-50GC and -110GC boxes of ABCB1. Among the several
GC boxes of ABCB1 that are essential for its activation, the
-50GC and -110GC boxes are regarded to be highly relevant
binding sites for ABCB1 activators and repressors [35].
The -50GC box appeared to be slightly hypomethylated in
12 hr culture whereas it displayed detectable methylation
in 24 hr culture, which was emphasized when the cells
overexpressed FOXO3a and received PTX treatment. The
-110GC box was determined to have relatively higher
methylation levels with the same observed status as that
of the -50GC box when the cells overexpressed FOXO3a
in 24 hr culture (Figure 4F). To further confirm that the
methylation modifications in PTX-resistant cells with
5-FU cross-resistance were stimulated in part by drugs, we
employed a COBRA analysis of the cytosine-phosphateguanine (CpG) site of the Inr region of ABCB1. DNA
methylation was increased after a relatively higher dose
of PTX, 5-FU, and combination treatments (Figure 4G).
Thus, the changes in ABCB1 promoter methylation can
be triggered partly by FOXO3a overexpression and drugs,
whereby cancer cells have acquired first-line resistance and
cross-resistance.
To examine whether the FOXO3a-mediated
regulation of ABCB1 and subsequent TUBB3 expression are
influenced by FOXO3a up-stream effectors, we determined
the expressions of Akt signaling molecules that were highly
associated with FOXO3a activity. We also employed

intracellular ATP levels was also observed in A549-PacR/5FU cells (Figure 3K). Interestingly, 5-FU cross-resistance
in PacR cells caused minimal deficiency in the verapamilinduced regulation of P-gp/ABCB1 with prevented rapid
ABCB1 gene suppression, but there was an observed
reduction in A549-PacR/5-FU cells (left panel, Figure 3L).
Compared to the A549-PacR cell line, from which the
PacR/5-FU variant was derived, verapamil caused a failure
to inhibit P-gp expression and distribution (right panel,
Figure 3L). These results argue that the physiological
role of MDR in protecting cells from apoptosis may have
different genetic drivers addressing P-gp protection instead
of the direct effects of drugs on P-gp. In support of this,
it has been reported that PTX-resistance in breast cancer
cells is associated with profound changes in the cell death
response with the regulation of multiple apoptotic factors
conferring platinum resistance [29].

FOXO3a regulates ABCB1 transcription to
coordinate the TUBB3 response in PTX-resistant
cancer cells with 5-FU cross-resistance
To determine the mechanism by which regulated
FOXO3a and TUBB3 levels affect P-gp-associated MDR
in PTX-resistant cancer cells, we employed transient
GFP-tagged-gene and/or siRNA transfections (see the
Experimental Procedures) in A549-PacR/5-FU and
PC-3-PacR/5-FU cells. The difficulty of identifying
TUBB3 effector genes and other interacting factors has
been addressed in drug-resistant cancers because of the
complexity of tubulin auto-regulation many years before
identifying the association of β-tubulin isotypes and PTX
resistance [30]. FOXO transcription factors regulate mt
defects by regulating tubulin loops [19, 31]; although
this observation has not yet been implicated in several
malignancies, considerable progress has been made in
associating FOXO-mediated mt stability regulation and
taxol-resistance in some cancers. In A549-PacR and
PC-3-PacR sublines with 5-FU cross-resistance, the
overexpression of FOXO3a up-regulated both ABCB1
and TUBB3 whereas the direct silencing of ABCB1 caused
incomplete inhibition of TUBB3 at both mRNA and protein
levels (Figure 4A). To determine whether FOXO3a is able
to directly regulate TUBB3, the FOXO3a gene was knocked
down, and silencing FOXO3a was shown to directly inhibit
TUBB3 with both mRNA and protein expression completely
suppressed (Figure 4B).
The ubiquitin-proteasome system has also been
associated with βIII-tubulin protein degradation and
epigenetic regulation [32]. To further dissect how βIIItubulin protein expression is controlled in cancer cells with
MDR, we employed the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent
degradation pathway. When A549-PacR/5-FU and PC-3PacR/5-FU cells transfected with EV or FOXO3a-GFP are
treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, it suppresses
the degradation of βIII-tubulin in both cell models;

doxorubicin to mechanistically identify the role of druginduced FOXO3a phosphorylation on P-gp expression
because doxorubicin was found to induce Akt-dependent
FOXO3a activity [36]. Doxorubin up-regulated Akt and
FOXO3a and increased their phosphorylation in both
A549-PacR/5-FU and PC-3-PacR/5-FU cells. FOXO3a
overexpression derived more preserved doxorubicininduced p27/Kip1 activation except for IκB-α, which
appeared to be unaffected in both conditions. Doxorubicin
strikingly up-regulated P-gp and βIII-tubulin expression
in cells overexpressing FOXO3a (Figure 4H). Given that
PI3K/Akt signaling is involved in predominant MDR,
which is further associated with the increase of doxorubicinmediated FOXO3a nuclear accumulation [37], these
findings suggest that the involvement of FOXO3a activity
in regulating the P-gp and βIII-tubulin response involves a
doxorubicin-induced PI3K/Akt mechanism. Interestingly,
we found that in both drug-resistant phenotypes of the PC-3
cell line, PacR and PacR/5-FU, doxorubicin stimulated the
methylation of FOXO3a at the arginine residues of the cells
overexpressing FOXO3a (Figure 4I). This suggests that an
alteration in the Akt-induced phosphorylation inhibition
of FOXO3a through arginine methylation is associated
with acquired resistance. We then studied whether the
doxorubicin-induced nuclear translocation of FOXO3a is
affected using PC-3-PacR/5-FU as a model. Notably, we
found an increase in cytosolic FOXO3a when cells received
doxorubicin alone or in combination with either PTX or
5-FU (Figure 4J, 4K), with doxorubicin alone causing
cytosolic condensation of FOXO3a in the same cells
(Figure 4L).
We next addressed whether MRP1 (encoded by
ABCC1) expression is involved in the FOXO3a-regulated
ABCB1 mechanism in the PC-3-PacR/5-FU phenotype
because this specific model was found to overexpress
MRP1 at higher levels compared to the same line of
acquired resistance derived from A549 cells (see Table 1).
We found no significant changes, although MRP1 is
abundantly expressed in EV-transfected cells, whereas
in FOXO3a overexpressing cells, doxorubicin induced
MRP1 up- regulation in both protein and gene expression
levels (Figure 4M). Similar to previous reports, this finding
may support the high correlation of MRP1 hyperactivation
with PTEN-controlled PI3K/Akt cascade in acquired drug
resistance in prostate cancer cells [38].

cancer cells in response to targeted therapies, such as kinase
inhibitors, drive the outgrowth of drug-resistant cells [41].
Based on these findings and to refocus on cross-resistance
manifestation, we hypothesized that signals derived from
PTX-resistant cancer cells with cross-resistance to 5-FU
and the PTX-analogue, DCT, can influence the contentious
onset of multiple cross-resistance in first-line PTX-resistant
cancers. To examine this speculation in vitro, we acquired
conditioned media (CM) (see schematic diagram in
Figure 5A) from PacR/5FU, PacR/DCT, and their
combination (1:1 ratio) cultured with low-dose drug
treatment and co-cultured this media with young passage
A549-PacR cells (see schematic diagram in Figure 5B). We
mixed CM from A549-PacR/DCT with DMSO-treated cell
CM and performed subsequent FOXO3a gene transfections;
we combined A549-PacR/DCT-CM with A549-PacR/5FU-CM and performed subsequent TUBB3 RNAi; and
we combined A549-PacR/5-FU-CM with A549-PacR/
DCT-CM and performed dual FOXO3a and ABCB1 gene
transfections. The rationale behind these combinations
was based on previous findings relating the gene of
interest to a specific class of cross-resistance occurring in
drug-resistant cancers [42, 43, 44]. To study the effect of
the above-described scheme on the FOXO3a-regulated
ABCB1 mechanism and TUBB3 response in a more growthrelevant system, we performed a colony formation assay.
PacR cells pre-exposed to DCT-CM following FOXO3aGFP transfection formed more drug-resistant colonies than
EV-transfected cells. The transient knockdown of TUBB3
prevented the outgrowth of colonies derived from PacR
cells pre-exposed to a combination of 5-FU-CM and DCTCM, producing significantly lesser colonies than scramble
control cells. Furthermore, the effect of TUBB3 knockdown
on colony formation with the same drug combinationCM pre-exposure was completely opposite that of cells
overexpressing both FOXO3a and ABCB1 (Figure 5C),
whereas the observation was significantly supported
with the cell growth response of A549-PacR cells that
experienced the same drug-CM pre-exposure as described
above (A549-PacR/5-FU-CM) with subsequent dosedependent 5-FU treatment. Relative to cells transfected with
either EV or scramble siRNA, FOXO3a overexpression
promoted drug-resistant cell growth whereas the
knockdown of TUBB3 suppressed cell growth in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5D). To determine whether
FOXO3a-induced growth promotion involves ABCB1,
we transfected the same cells with ABCB1-GFP alone,
co-transfection with FOXO3a-GFP, or transfection with
their respective empty vectors. The cells overexpressing
both FOXO3a and ABCB1 proliferated more rapidly than
the cells overexpressing ABCB1 alone following 5-FU
treatment (Figure 5E). Consistent with the involvement of
ABCB1, A549-PacR cells that were pre-exposed to A549PacR/5-FU-CM followed by subsequent FOXO3a-GFP
transfection displayed higher P-gp distribution than control
cells (Figure 5F). Employing the same scheme of drug-CM

siRNA respective controls (EV, scramble siRNA) can be
observed in Supplementary Figure 3; although measurable,
no significant differences were found. Taken together, these
data indicate that secretome factors from PTX-resistant
cancer cells with acquired cross-resistance can sufficiently
influence MDR in first-line PTX-resistant cancers cells with
impaired FOXO3a-regulated ABCB1 activity and can be
predicted by TUBB3 feedback.
Meanwhile, the above described regulatory effects of
transient TUBB3 knockdown on P-gp function may not be
translated to GEF resistance because the reversal of drug
resistance after siRNA-mediated silencing was not observed
in H292-GefR cells (Supplementary Figure 4A, 4B).
Notably, TUBB3 knockdown did not significantly affect
P-gp efflux and ATPase activities (Supplementary Figure
4C, 4D), which can be traced on the preserved ABCB1 and
ABCC1 mRNA levels even after 5-FU and DCT stimulation
(Supplementary Figure 4E, 4F, 4G). These results suggest
that modification of TUBB3-directed effects on P-gp
regulation and cross-resistance can only be implied to PTXresistant cancer cells.

exposure, transient gene and/or siRNA transfections as in
Figure 5B, we found regulated gene expressions of TUBB3
(left panel) and protein expressions of βIII-tubulin, P-gp,
and MRP1 (right panel) in A549-PacR cells, suggesting
that the secreted factors from 5-FU cross-resistant PacR
cells influence the promotion of MDR through a FOXO3adirected ABCB1 mechanism (Figure 5G). Notably, in the
same cells, the overexpression of either FOXO3a or both
FOXO3a and ABCB1 subsequently induced the activation
of MRP1.
To functionally characterize the effects of FOXO3a
on P-gp activity, we addressed the drug efflux function
of the P-gp pump incorporating the Rho-123 and ABCB1
ATPase assays. FOXO3a overexpression significantly
blocked the intracellular accumulation of the Rho-123
fluorescent substrate following 5-FU and DCT treatment,
which was supported by the suppression of ABCB1
ATPase activity (Figure 5H left panel). Correspondingly,
TUBB3 knockdown resulted in enhanced accumulation
of the substrate and increased ABCB1 ATPase activity
(Figure 5H right panel). Accordingly, TUBB3 knockdown
sensitized the cells to 5-FU, resulting in fewer formed
colonies compared to control cells upon drug exposure
(Figure 5I).
To understand the role of secreted signals from
A549-PacR cells with multiple acquired cross-resistance
in promoting P-gp-associated MDR, we directly harvested
CM from A549-PacR/5-FU, A549-PacR-/DCT, and A549PacR-/CIS cells followed by individual or combination
transient gene or siRNA transfections (see scheme in
Figure 5J). The TUBB3 gene response to various
transfections was determined by qRT-PCR (Supplementary
Figure 2) and was used as an indicative mechanism factor
in consequent cell growth and Rho-123 accumulation.
Drug-resistant cells progressed significantly more rapidly
when TUBB3 was activated in response to co-transfection
of FOXO3a-GFP and ABCB1-GFP whereas cell growth
progressed more slowly when TUBB3 was negatively
regulated in response to co-transfection of FOXO3asiRNA and ABCB1-siRNA (Figure 5L). Verifying this
finding, Rho-123 intracellular accumulation was inhibited
when TUBB3 was suppressed whereas Rho-123 substrate
accumulation was increased when TUBB3 was activated
in response to similar gene modifications as described
above (Figure 5M). The results of the cell growth and Rho123 accumulation assays for cells transfected with gene/

Transient knockdown of TUBB3 supresses the
ABCB1-associated aggressive cell phenotype and
alters subcutaneous tumor physiology
PTX-resistant cancers highlight the acquisition of
an aggressive phenotype exhibiting abnormal nuclear
morphology and faster cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics
[43, 44]. To elaborate the involvement of TUBB3 in the
mechanism by which acquired PTX-resistance and 5-FU
cross-resistance develop aggressiveness, we employed
various cell-based and protein expression assays that
characterize cancer cell invasiveness. In both A549PacR and A549-PacR/5-FU developed phenotypes,
TUBB3 knockdown induced an increase in the G0/G1
transition phase, resulting in an increased G1/S-phase ratio
compared to both controls (Figure 6A). Similarly, scant
TUBB3 transcription resulted in an expedited S-phase
fraction identified by BrdU incorporation, down-regulated
the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, and promoted
the inhibition of cell-cycle regulatory proteins, thus
collectively explaining the gradual decrease in cell growth
(Figure 6B, 6C). In relation, our preliminary findings on
5-FU stimulated outgrowth of A549-PacR cells suggest
that TUBB3 deficiency reduces the cells contentious

growth rate but fails to induce complete attenuation
(Supplementary Figure 5). Targeted silencing of TUBB3
regulated the protein expressions of EMT markers,
revealing a general trend away from the epithelium and
towards the mesenchyme (Figure 6D). Interestingly, the
distribution of vimentin in A549-PacR/5-FU control cells
was condensed in the cytoplasm, and some appeared to be
atypical to the nucleus. The same cells with silenced TUBB3
expression inhibited the immunofluorescence of vimentin
(Figure 6E). Along with Akt and ERK signals, the classical
EMT markers encompass key factors that regulate drugresistant aggressiveness [45]. This may suggest that
modification of mt stability through TUBB3 affects the
distinctive EMT-driven hostile outgrowth of the tumor intercellular system in cancers with MDR, at least in vitro.
We next elucidated the probable involvement of Akt
by incorporating the LY294002 inhibitor. The knockdown
of TUBB3 escalated the LY294002-induced Akt-inhibition
in A549-PacR/5-FU cells at the protein level compared
to scramble siRNA-transfected cells except with little
alteration between non-treated and LY294002-treated
siTUBB3-transfected cells (Figure 6F). In addition, a
concurrent increase in intracellular ATP levels was evident
in siTUBB3-transfected cells compared to scramble siRNAtransfected cells in both A549-PacR and A549-PacR/5-FU
cells (Figure 6G). This prompted us to further evaluate the
association of TUBB3-induced Akt activity suppression
in cell mobility and invasiveness. The same attenuation
of TUBB3 siRNA-induced effects were observed in the
Akt-dependent promotion of intrinsic apoptosis, which
supports escape from drug-induced apoptosis (Figure 6H),
and in cell migration, invasion, and colony formation in
soft agar, indicating that the metastatic aggressiveness of
PTX-resistant cells with acquired cross-resistance, at least
to 5-FU, can be controlled by TUBB3 (Figure 6I).
In support of the identified TUBB3-dependent
effects in multidrug resistance in vitro, a tumor xenograft
model was used to examine the probable drug resistanttumor physiological alteration in vivo by modifying
TUBB3 transcription. The nude mice were randomized
and subcutaneously engrafted with A549-PacR/5-FU and
PC-3-PacR/5-FU cells transfected in vitro with either
scramble siRNA or TUBB3 siRNA. At the termination
of the experiment (35 days after inoculation) (see in vivo
experiment scheme in Figure 6J), the TUBB3 deficient
tumors showed less condensed tumor mass and induced
susceptibility to apoptosis (Figure 6K). These data
confirmed that the described genetic and other substantial
factors affecting TUBB3 transcription directly affect
metastatic tumor progression of drug-resistant cancer cells,
specifically PTX-resistant tumors with acquired crossresistance to unrelated drugs (at least to 5-FU and CIS).
Preliminarily, we observed the regression of tumor growth
using a small-size sample group in TUBB3-deficient
subcutaneous tumors. The subcutaneous tumor mass (in
grams; g) of the control group was approximately 1.98 g
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(n = 2; 8 isolated tumor xenografts of A549-PacR/5-FU)
and 0.89 g (n = 2; 8 isolated tumor xenografts of PC-3PacR/CIS), whereas the mass of the tumor induced by
TUBB3 siRNA-transfected cells was inhibited by 19%
(p < 0.011) and 32% (p < 0.005) with tumor masses of
approximately 1.62 g (n = 2; 8 isolated tumor xenografts
of A549-PacR/5-FU) and 0.61 g (n = 3; 12 isolated tumor
xenografts of PC-3-PacR/CIS) (Supplementary Figure 8),
respectively.
A biochemical analysis of the tumor tissues was
performed to substantiate the in vitro findings and evaluate
those findings in a more physiologically-relevant manner.
We confirmed the in vivo transient siRNA transfection
efficiency by qRT-PCR using RNA extracted from tumor
samples. TUBB3 siRNA reduced the TUBB3 mRNA level
by 47% and the ABCB1 mRNA level by 19% in A549PacR/5-FU-induced subcutaneous tumors whereas in
PC-3-PacR/CIS tumors, TUBB3 was reduced by 31% and
ABCB1 by 29% relative to the mRNA levels from tumors
induced by scramble siRNA transfected cells (Figure 6L).
To further elaborate the consequences of scant TUBB3 on
P-gp expression, we determined their protein expression
levels in extracts from frozen xenograft tumor tissue
samples. We observed down regulated levels of βIII-tubulin
and P-gp in TUBB3-deficient subcutaneous tumors. We
then determined the gene expressions of Akt and VEGF in
an attempt to explain their effects on tumor progression. A
similar paradigm in which tumor endothelial cells acquire
drug resistance involving Akt and VEGF signaling to
promote metastatic tumor growth was previously reported
[46]. Thus, reduced tumor mass in response to TUBB3
knockdown is influenced by Akt and VEGF signals, which
we found to suppress Akt gene expression and attenuate
VEGF levels in A549-PacR/5-FU tumors (Figure 6N).
These results confirm the regulation of Akt signaling in
modified TUBB3 status associated with acquired crossresistance in PTX-resistant cancer in vivo and in vitro.

FOXO3a-directed feedback control of TUBB3
transcription confines PTX-targeted microtubule
stability in PTX-resistant A549 cells with
acquired cross-resistance
Notably, although several cancer cell models of
mt-stabilizing drug resistance (e.g., taxol) have been
concomitantly associated with reduced mt stability
[47,  48], a precise characterization of tubulin dynamics
in A549 cells with acquired MDR has not yet been welldescribed. We then identified whether the tubulin dynamics
in the resistant phenotypes we developed had changed
relative the mt status of parental A549 cells. The tubulin
microtubules (pellet fraction, P) were measured after being

fraction, S). The cells confirmed to have PTX resistance

the tubulin is present in the polymerized form (Pol), in
contrast to A549-PacR/5-FU cells, in which the majority
of the tubulin is in the soluble form (Sol). This is an
interesting observation because a significant difference
has been identified between PacR and PacR/5-FU cells
associated with tubulin polymerization. Further, the
addition of lysate from PacR cells at a higher fraction of
PacR/5-FU lysates did not induce polymerization of tubulin
but was more polymerized when the lysate fraction from
the PacR/5-FU variant was decreased (Figure 7C). Thus,
there is partially an induction of polymerization amended
by PacR cells to 5-FU cross-resistant subline PacR cells,
which is associated with the recruitment of tubulin in the
presence of polymerized tubulin. Next, we addressed the
functional mechanism by which modification on TUBB3
transcription affects mt stability and tubulin polymerization.
In A549-PacR/5-FU cells, upon incorporating the transient
transfection of FOXO3a and ABCB1 genes or siRNAs,
TUBB3 gene expression can be modified correspondingly.
Using these feedback control patterns, as verified by qRTPCR (see scheme in Figure 7D, 7E), we subjected the
control transfected cells (EV) and transfection schemedependent transfected cells (TS) based on the TUBB3
response to the same assay of mt stability as that described
in the method used for Figure 7C. The successful negative
regulation of TUBB3 through the co-transfection of both
FOXO3a and ABCB1 siRNAs conferred stabilization of the
cytoskeletal mt through tubulin dynamics while preserving
TUBB3 transcription in cells transfected with FOXO3aGFP and ABCB1 siRNA. FOXO3a siRNA and ABCB1-GFP
were characterized as no-feedback and did not significantly
induce any changes in the undermined mt tubulin levels
after the treatment with PTX (Figure 7F); similar
patterns were obtained in those without PTX treatment
(Supplementary Figure 9). As reported previously, disrupted
TUBB3 functioning underlies impaired mt stability whereas
missense mutations causing the loss of TUBB3 can induce
increased mt stability [50, 51]. This led us to hypothesize
that the development of 5-FU cross-resistance in our PacR
variant might have induced mutations in TUBB3, thus
causing its FOXO3a-directed negative regulation feedback

by the subsequent acquisition of 5-FU cross-resistance.
Surprisingly, although it is a PTX-analogue, transient crossresistance to DCT strikingly destabilized tubulin dynamics,
and the development of cross-resistance to a combination
of 5-FU and DCT completely undermined tubulin levels
in mt. In PacR cancer cells with cross-resistance to
5-FU, DCT, and 5-FU+DCT, the regulation of tubulindependent mt stability, which showed an impaired mt
status, was evident and was strictly responsive to increasing
concentrations of PTX (Figure 7A). This suggests that the
acquisition of PTX resistance has less stable mt and that
the development of cross-resistance to other agents can
augment this event, showing more impaired mt dynamics
through the modification of tubulin in mt. The stability
of mt can be represented by the acetylation status of mt
because post-translationally, tubulin is modified by mt
acetylation, which directs conserved mt dynamics [49].
Because less tubulin was found in A549 cells with PTXresistance and developed cross-resistance, this prompted
us to measure the acetylated microtubules in the lysates
of A549, A549-PacR, and A549-PacR/5-FU cells treated
with or without PTX using an acetylated tubulin-specific
antibody. Acquired PTX resistance and cross-resistance
resulted in lower acetylation of tubulin than parental cells
(Figure 7B). Combined with the reduced amount of mt
found in the MDR phenotype, these data suggest that firstline PTX resistance confers less stable microtubules, which
can further be augmented with the consequential onset of
cross-resistance, at least to 5-FU.
To examine whether a soluble factor required for
tubulin polymerization was influenced in the resistant
sublines and whether it can differentiate, to a certain
degree, the less stable mt we found as described above, we
performed a mixing experiment. Whole cell lysates from
A549-PacR cells were added to the lysate from A549PacR/5-FU cells at varying ratios of 1:1, 1:4, and 1:19
(PacR:PacR/5-FU) to examine whether PTX resistance
could affect the state of polymerization in the 5-FU crossresistant lysate, which we further associated with a PTXtargeted mt mechanism by incorporating PTX treatment.

to increase mt stability, in part by increasing polymerized
tubulin (Figure 7G). These findings indicate that incidence
of the cross-resistance phenomenon in PTX-resistant
cancers results in less mt stability associated with tubulins
and their polymerization and that the regulation of mt
dynamics can be coordinated directly by TUBB3 genetic
modifications, particularly by targeting FOXO3a-mediated
ABCB1 activity.

The development of transient cross-resistance to drugs that
are chemically different from PTX induced regulation in
FOXO3a and TUBB3 endogenous expressions, encouraged
escape from etoposide- and verapamil-induced cell death
and was highly associated with P-gp hyperactivation.
In support, we found regulated apoptotic signals and
escalated intracellular ATP levels, which demonstrate a
complementary mechanism by which MDR acquisition
is associated with a drug response. Furthermore, druginduced activation of FOXO3a up-regulates P-gp/ABCB1
expression at gene promoter levels, which promotes cell
death regulation and increases cell survival [55, 59]. We
currently lack experimental evidence on the genetic drivers
that specify the augmentation of chemically different
acquired drug cross-resistance in tumors that developed
prior to first-line acquired drug resistance, which is a
well-known characteristic of MDR aggression. Here, to
address this particular issue and to shed light on the onset
of multiplicity of cross-resistance defining MDR, we
examined the influence of FOXO3a-regulated ABCB1 to
TUBB3 feedback control, as suspected from our preliminary
findings. We found that transient TUBB3 activation,
through ABCB1, in response to the stimulation of FOXO3a
expression, significantly contributes to the cross-resistance
of the PTX-resistant cell population and consequently
limits the efficacy of both agents where cancer cells
have developed multiple resistance. Mechanistic studies
clearly demonstrate that the observed TUBB3 feedback
control was physiologically, at least in part, amended by
the ubiquitin-proteasome system engaged in the ubiquitin
degradation pathway because the proteasome inhibitor upregulated βIII-tubulin expression. Further, we found that
increased polyubiquitination of TUBB3 was correlated
with FOXO3a silencing in 5-FU cross-resistant PacR
cancer cells which reflects a strong transcriptional feedback
control of TUBB3. The role of the ubiquitin-proteasome
system in mt polymerization in cells has been previously
described but remains underscored because malfunctioning
of this system has been implicated in a variety of diseases
[60, 61]. However, in our in vitro model of acquired PTX
resistance and 5-FU cross-resistance, the observed systemic
polyubiquitination of βIII-tubulin appeared to support
previous findings on the role of specific ubiquitin substrates
essential for tumor drug resistance [62].
In assessing the extent by which FOXO3a regulates
ABCB1 transcription, we evaluated the methylation profiles
of ABCB1 promoter boxes deemed essential for P-gp
activation and drug efflux pump hyperactivity conferring
MDR. Of note, the transient overexpression of FOXO3a
marginally promoted ABCB1 methylation at the -50GC and
-110GC boxes, which are highly relevant binding sites for
ABCB1 substrates. PTX and 5-FU-mediated drug-induced
methylation was also observed as confirmed by COBRA
at the CpG site of the Inr region of ABCB1, which showed
increased DNA methylation. This finding appears to be
critical in urging 5-FU cross-resistance in PTX-resistant
cancers [63, 64].Therefore, the regulatory effects of

DISCUSSION
PTX and its synthetic analogues have emerged as
effective and clinically validated chemotherapeutic agents
targeting the mt cytoskeleton with broad activity in solid
tumors and hematological malignancies [52, 53]. However,
the occurrence of altered tubulin isotype expressions such
as class III β-tubulin (encoded by TUBB3) is prominent in
cancers receiving taxane-based therapy [54]. The factors
contributing to genetic modifications of TUBB3 have been
poorly understood in the context of acquired drug resistance
in several malignancies. Contrasting studies have been the
center of controversy portraying tubulin point mutations
at the PTX-binding sites conferring drug resistance.
Previous reports noted disparities in the involvement
of mutations in the class I β-tubulin isotype providing
DNA sequencing of the fourth exon, which contains the
paclitaxel-binding site, with primary drug resistance [54,
55]. This discrepancy was further supported with the results
of the DNA sequence for Kα1-tubulin, in which mutations
were absent in both sensitive and resistant patients with
invariable SNPs independently affecting patients’ responses
to PTX [56, 57]. These clinical events shifted the focus
to βIII-tubulin-associated multiple genetic alterations in
aggressive and drug refractory cancers because βIII-tubulin
has been mechanistically correlated with tubulin-binding
agents (TBAs) although it is poorly understood in the
context of drug resistance [58]. Accordingly, βIII-tubulin
has recently been classified as a biomarker for the onset of
PTX-specific relapse for some cancer types. Thus, there is
urgency in identifying molecular signatures that result in
the modification of βIII-tubulin at the transcriptional level
in PTX-resistant cancers to accelerate the design of MDR
reversal agents.
The present study demonstrates that TUBB3
transcription can be controlled by FOXO3a-mediated
ABCB1 regulation and can subsequently promote the
profusion of multiple cross-resistance and govern the
tumor progression of PTX-resistant cancers. In a panel of
normal and tumor cells that were primarily derived from
the lung and prostate, we found that P-gp-associated drugresistant (PacR and GefR) cancer cells express higher
TUBB3 and FOXO3a levels compared to drug-sensitive
normal cells. Notably, we determined that our developed
PTX-resistant cancer cells display cross-resistance to a
variety of chemically different drugs including 5-FU, CIS
and the PTX-analogue DCT. This occurrence led us to
develop a transient cellular model of this cross-resistance.

FOXO3a on P-gp control add another layer of complexity
to the role of FOXO transcription factors in drug resistance
and provide an understanding for conflicting activities
in between. We identified the involvement of the PI3K/
Akt pathway, a critical regulator of FOXO transcription
factors, in this FOXO3a-directed regulation of P-gp at the
protein expression level. Our results also underscore the
association of these FOXO effectors, showing regulated
levels of phospho-Akt and p27/Kip1 in FOXO3a
overexpressing cells, which influence the control of P-gp

and βIII-tubulin. Although the regulatory activity of these
signals in several drug-resistant models derived from
colon and breast cancers has been reported [65, 66], this
is the first study to reflect these associations in a MDR
model stipulating 5-FU cross-resistance in PTX-resistant
cancer cells. We also demonstrated a doxorubicin-induced
increase in FOXO3a methylation at arginine residues and
increased FOXO3a translocation from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm, which sheds light on how FOXO3a regulates
ABCB1. Interestingly, complimentary activation of MRP1

has been observed in FOXO3a overexpressing cells,
depicting that the regulation of P-gp amended by FOXO3a
influences MRP1 as an adjoining factor in conferring
cross-resistance in PTX-resistant cancer cells.
The acquisition of PTX resistance is profoundly
associated with a more aggressive and superinvasive
phenotype both in vitro and in vivo [67, 68]. Although
highly associated with P-gp/ABCB1 hyperactivation,
P-gp inhibitors are often ineffective and toxic at the doses
required to suppress P-gp function in the clinic. In addition,
PTX relapsed tumors rapidly develop MDR [69]. Our
findings also indicate the contribution of secreted signals
of PTX-resistant cancer cells with 5-FU cross-resistance to
the outgrowth and regulation of FOXO3a-mediated ABCB1
transcription, leading to a drug transporter efflux increase.
Because these secretomes are unknown, we are not able to
directly assess the interaction with P-gp. Despite this, we
demonstrate that controlling the feedback of TUBB3 predicts
P-gp-mediated efflux function influenced by complex drugresistant secretomes in vitro. Furthermore, 5-FU crossresistant PacR cancer cells display increased EMT associated
with P-gp, which can be repressed by transient silencing of
TUBB3. Notably, the knockdown of TUBB3 resulted in the
attenuation of PacR/5-FU and PacR/CIS cancer cell-induced
tumors in vivo associated with regulated levels of Akt and
VEGF. Our study identifies that the response of TUBB3
from FOXO3a-regulated ABCB1 is a critical feedback
mechanism to genetically identify cross-resistance in PTXresistant cancers and its tumor progression.
Dysfunction in mt stability and tubulin
polymerization is associated with PTX resistance in
several malignancies [70]. These particular underpinnings
drove us to determine the status of mt dynamics in
our PTX-resistant cancer cells with a transient crossresistance model. In particular, we found that impaired
mt stability was correlated with the acquisition of the
PacR, PacR/5-FU, PacR/DCT, and PacR/5-FU+DCT
phenotypes. The lower acetylation level of tubulin in these
models compared to the parental phenotype confirms
irregularity in mt dynamics. Interestingly, we found
complete attenuation of polymerized tubulin in PacR/5FU cells compared to PacR cells with higher tubulin
polymerization. Furthermore, we found that transiently
silencing TUBB3 reversed the impaired mt stability in
PacR/5-FU cells. Finally, the most significant conclusion
of our study is that inducing FOXO3a activation mediates
an upsurge in ABCB1 transcription and P-gp function
and collectively controls the TUBB3 gene response to
confer multiplicity in cross-resistance to chemically
different drugs in PTX-resistant cancer cells (Figure 8).
Our study opens avenues for understanding how PTXresistant cancers develop MDR and subsequently develop
metastatic tumors. Our work also provides a rationale for
manipulating TUBB3/βIII-tubulin as a biomarker not just

for PTX-resistant cancers but also for cross-resistance to a

[71]. All fluorescent events were acquired using a FACSCalibur equipped with CellQuest Pro software (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Microtubule stability assessment, tubulin
polymerization and acetylated tubulin
measurement

ABCB1 and P-gp atpase activity, Rho-123 assay,
and ATP quantification

Mt stability was assessed with slight modification
as described previously [85]. Degree of tubulin
polymerization, mixing experiment, and measurement
of relative acetylated tubulin in cells were carried out as
described previously [4].

ATPase activity determination was carried out using
ABCB1 PREDEASY ATPase kit and Pgp-Glo Assay
System kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega and Solvo Biotechnology, respectively). Rho123 accumulation assay was carried out as described
previously [71]. Determination of intracellular ATP
content was performed using EnzyLight ATP Assay kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions (BioAssay
Systems).

Software, statistics, and image acquisition
Statistical analyses were assessed (p < 0.05) and
performed using OriginPro 8.0 (OriginLab, Northampton,
MA). IC50 values of all compounds and non-linear
regression were calculated using the TableCurve 2D v5.01
(Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). Statistical evaluation
were carried out using one-/two-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons post -test and Student’s
t test and x2 test. GraphPad Prism 5.01 software was used
to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Adobe
Photoshop software was also used for image acquisition
aid and only brightness and/or contrast of expression blots
were simultaneously changed for all areas only if deemed
necessary. All results were obtained from at least three
independent experiments and most were biologically
replicated. The data are presented as mean ± SD.

Isolation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts
Cells were harvested at 80% confluence through
trypsination. Isolation of nuclei and cytosol was carried
out using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction
Reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL) following manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cell migration, invasion, and soft agar assays
Chemotaxis-induced migration and cell invasion
assays were carried out in Boyden chamber wells with
or without matrigel-based membrane as described
previously [73]. Anchorage-independent growth
was assessed in a two-layer agar system with final
concentration of 0.8% for the bottom and 0.4% for the
top agarose layers according to manufacturer’s protocol
(Millipore, Bedford, MA).
