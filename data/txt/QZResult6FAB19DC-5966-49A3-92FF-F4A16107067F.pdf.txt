BACKGROUND: Women with BRCA1 mutations develop breast cancer with similar pathologic features to sporadic triple negative (TN) breast cancer, a subtype associated with early disease relapse and poor outcome. The clinical outcome of women with and without BRCA1 mutations who had TN breast cancer treated with conventional
chemotherapy were compared. METHODS: Women with stage I to III TN breast cancer who had BRCA1 testing within
36 months of diagnosis and received alkylating chemotherapy were identified from clinical databases and a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) specimen bank. BRCA2 mutation carriers were excluded, resulting in a
study cohort of 46 BRCA1 carriers and 71 noncarriers. Sites of metastasis, relapse rates, and survival were compared
among carriers and noncarriers. The median follow-up was 75 months. RESULTS: BRCA1 carriers were younger at diagnosis (P < .001) and had smaller tumors (P ¼ .03) than noncarriers. Freedom from distant metastasis at 5 years
was 76% for carriers and 70% for noncarriers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, P ¼ .5). Sites of distant recurrence did not differ
significantly (P ¼ .15), although BRCA1 carriers had a propensity for brain relapse (58% vs 24%, P ¼ .06). Overall survival at 5 years was 82% for carriers and 74% for noncarriers (HR 0.64, P ¼ .25). Adjusting for age and stage, BRCA1
mutation status was not an independent predictor of survival (HR 0.73, P ¼ .48). CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1 mutation
carriers with TN disease had similar survival rates to noncarriers when treated with alkylating chemotherapy. Women
with BRCA1-related breast cancer may benefit from novel therapies that target DNA repair, and further study
is needed to identify sporadic TN breast cancers with a BRCA-deficient phenotype. Cancer 2011;117:3093–100.

Triple negative (TN) breast cancer accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancer subtypes but a proportionately larger
number of breast cancer deaths.1 The TN subtype is characterized by the absence of expression of estrogen receptor (ER),
progesterone receptor (PR), and the epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TN breast cancers are diagnosed at a
younger age and have aggressive biologic behavior with the development of local-regional and distant metastasis within 5
years.2,3 Distant metastases more often involve visceral sites such as the brain and lung, and less likely bone and liver.4‥6
Despite systemic therapy, distant metastasis-free survival for patients with localized TN breast cancer is approximately
70% at 5 years, with overall 5-year survival rates ranging from 70% to 80%.2,7
The majority of breast cancers that develop in women with germline mutations in the BRCA1 breast cancer susceptibility gene are TN cancers.8,9 BRCA1 has a central function in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, and loss of function mutations in BRCA1 lead to genomic instability and underlie cancer predisposition.10 BRCA1-related TN cancers
share several pathologic features with sporadic TN cancers, including low or absent expression of hormone receptors and
HER2, high histologic and nuclear grade, and high mitotic index.8,11,12 By gene expression profiling, BRCA1-related
breast cancers, as well as the majority of sporadic TN breast cancers, cluster within the basal subgroup13 and express basal

cytokeratins and EGFR.14 Recent studies have also shown
that a proportion of sporadic basal-like breast cancers may
have a dysfunctional BRCA1 pathway due to gene promoter methylation or transcriptional inactivation.15,16
Despite the significant overlap between the clinical
and biologic features of sporadic and BRCA1-related TN
breast cancers, the prognostic significance of a deleterious
BRCA1 mutation in women with TN breast cancer is not
known. Prognostic differences between mutation carriers
and noncarriers could influence the treatment decisions of
patients and their physicians regarding the use of adjuvant
chemotherapy or preventative surgeries, such as prophylactic mastectomy. The goal of this study was to determine
whether BRCA1 mutation status was associated with a difference in survival in women with TN breast cancer
treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. We analyzed the
rates of local-regional and distant relapse, sites of distant
metastasis, breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival in BRCA1 mutation carriers and noncarriers diagnosed with invasive TN breast cancer who were treated
with alkylating chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A review of the clinical databases and annotated Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) specimen
bank at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and DanaFarber Cancer Institute identified 183 women diagnosed
with invasive TN breast cancer between January 1, 1996
and December 31, 2004 for whom BRCA1 testing had
been performed. BRCA2 mutation carriers were excluded.
ER, PR, and HER2 status, assessed as part of the routine
clinical evaluation, was abstracted from institutional pathology reports. BRCA1 mutation status had previously
been established for 120 of these women who had donated
blood for research by high thoughput heteroduplex detection from a banked blood sample as described previously.17 Fourteen of these 120 women carried a BRCA1
mutation. The other 63 BRCA1 mutation carriers identified had genetic testing performed by commercial methods in high-risk clinics. Inclusion in the cohort required
the diagnosis of a first invasive stage I to III TN breast cancer and use of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Therefore, 15 women were excluded for the following reasons: diagnosis of a second or third primary breast cancer
(n ¼ 7), stage IV disease (n ¼ 1), and no adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy given (n ¼ 7).
To limit the potential survival bias of delayed
genetic testing, 19 mutation carriers and 15 noncarriers

3094

were excluded because the time to genetic testing was >36
months from breast cancer diagnosis. An additional 12
women were excluded for unsuccessful genotyping, and 5
women had BRCA1 variants of unknown significance.
The final study cohort consisted of 117 women, including
46 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 71 noncarriers. Clinical
data were abstracted from the medical record, including
review of operative notes, pathology reports, and clinic
visits with the approval of the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board.
Chemotherapy was delivered in the adjuvant setting
in 108 patients (92%), and 9 patients received neoadjuvant treatment. The majority of chemotherapy regimens
contained an anthracycline backbone (91%), most
commonly doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC),
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluoruracil (CAF) or
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel
(ACþT). Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) was used in 9 patients (8%). Docetaxel
and cyclophosphamide (TC) was used in 2 patients (2%).
Nine women (8%) received hormonal therapy, including
tamoxifen in 7 and leuprolide acetate in 2 for chemoprevention and fertility preservation. Mastectomy was performed in 52 patients (44%) and partial mastectomy in
65 (56%). Eighty-two patients (70%) received adjuvant
radiation to the breast (48 patients), breast and nodal
areas (15 patients), or chest wall and nodal areas (19
patients).
According to institutional practice, patients were
seen in routine follow-up every 3 to 6 months for 3 years
after the completion of therapy, and thereafter every 6
months. Follow-up visits included an interval history and
physical examination. Surveillance imaging was not
routine and performed at the discretion of the treating
physician. The site or sites of metastatic disease were
documented following restaging chest, abdomen, and pelvis computed tomography (CT). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed if clinical history
was concerning for metastatic brain disease. Recurrent
disease was categorized as local-regional, distant, or a
combination of sites. Local-regional recurrence was
defined as recurrent disease in the ipsilateral breast, chest
wall, or draining lymph nodes (axilla, supraclavicular, or
internal mammary chain). The first sites of distant metastatic involvement were documented after restaging studies were performed. The diagnosis of a second cancer and
incident brain metastasis were also recorded.
Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software JMP version 7.0.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary,

were compared for BRCA1 carriers and noncarriers using
a chi-square approximation, Fisher exact test, or Wilcoxon test. Actuarial estimates of local-regional failure,
freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM), breast cancerspecific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were
calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by
a log-rank test. Local-regional recurrence was defined
from the date of diagnosis until the date of recurrence
involving the ipsilateral breast, chest wall, or regional lymphatics. Patients who had a prophylactic mastectomy after
breast-conserving therapy (BCT) were censored from the
analysis at the date of surgery. Freedom from distant metastasis was defined from the date of diagnosis until the
date of first distant metastasis. Breast cancer-specific survival was determined from the date of diagnosis until

identify predictors of FFDM, BCSS, and OS: age, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, nodal status, tumor size, presence of lymphovascular invasion
(LVI), and BRCA1 mutation status. The univariate Cox
proportional hazards model was used to analyze continuous covariates. Multivariate analysis was performed using
the Cox proportional hazards model to identify independent predictors of DMFS, BCSS, and OS. A type 1 error

.14). Three carriers had a blood draw prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer at 17.0, 13.5, and 2.2 months.
BRCA1 mutation carriers were significantly younger at diagnosis than noncarriers (median age, 39.3 years vs 51.3
years, P < .001), as shown in Table 1. The most common
histologic type was invasive ductal carcinoma among both
carriers (96%) and noncarriers (89%). The median tumor
size was smaller for mutation carriers compared with noncarriers (1.8 cm vs 2.0 cm, P ¼ .03). Carriers and noncarriers had similar rates of high histologic grade (93% vs
91%), LVI (47% vs 44%), and nodal involvement (48%
vs 46%). In addition, the TNM and AJCC stage distributions did not significantly differ between the groups (Table 1). The treatment characteristics for the 117 women
with invasive TN breast cancer are summarized in Table 2
by mutation status. Mastectomy was more common in
mutation carriers (54%) than in noncarriers (38%) (P ¼
.08). The chemotherapy regimen most commonly used
was doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) or
ACþpaclitaxel in both groups. Adjuvant radiation was
delivered to 70% of mutation carriers and 77% of
noncarriers.
The median follow-up for survivors was 77 months
(range, 10-149 months) among BRCA1 mutation carriers
and 75 months (range, 13-114 months) for noncarriers.
Of the 21 mutation carriers and 44 noncarriers treated
with BCT, 2 (9.5%) carriers and 8 (18.2%) noncarriers
developed local-regional recurrence at a median of 22.4
months and 17.4 months, respectively. Following

and 5-year estimates of local-regional failure did not
differ between mutation carriers and noncarriers (Table 3).
Of note, 5 of 21 (23.8%) mutation carriers initially
treated with BCT had a prophylactic mastectomy at a
median of 48 months after diagnosis (range, 24-99
months).
Twelve mutation carriers and 21 noncarriers developed distant metastatic disease at a median of 22.4
months and 19.5 months after diagnosis, respectively. At
5 years, the freedom from distant metastasis was 75.6%
for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 69.9% for noncarriers
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, log-rank P ¼ .51) (Fig. 1). As
shown in Table 3, the most common site of first distant
metastatic spread in mutation carriers was lung (50%),
followed by bone, liver, and brain (25% each). For the 21
noncarriers with metastatic disease, the most common site
was lung (71%), followed by liver and bone (33%). None
of the noncarriers (0 of 21) developed brain metastasis at
the time of first distant relapse compared with 3 of 12
(25%) BRCA1 mutation carriers. The overall incidence of
brain metastasis was 58% (7 of 12) for carriers and 24%
(5 of 21) for noncarriers (P ¼ .06). The number of metastatic sites (1, 2, or >2) did not differ between the 2
groups (data not shown). The median number of salvage
chemotherapy regimens was 2 (range, 0-6) for both carriers and noncarriers (P ¼ .98).
The cause of death was breast cancer for all patients
who died during the study period (9 carriers, 19 noncarriers). Breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival
at 5 years was 82.1% for BRCA1 mutation carriers and
73.9% for noncarriers (HR 0.64, log-rank P ¼ .25) (Fig.
2). On univariate analysis for survival, AJCC stage, nodal
involvement, tumor size, and the presence of LVI were
significant predictors of FFDM and BCSS (Table 4). On
multivariate analysis when adjusted for age and stage,
BRCA1 mutation was not an independent predictor of
FFDM (HR 0.90, P ¼ .79) or BCSS (HR 0.73, P ¼ .48).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the clinical outcome of women with TN breast cancer treated
with conventional chemotherapy according to BRCA1
mutation status. Freedom from distant metastasis and
overall survival did not differ significantly between
BRCA1 mutation carriers and noncarriers. BRCA1 carriers
had a propensity for brain relapse, although the rate and
distribution of metastatic sites did not differ significantly
by mutation status. When adjusted by age and stage,
BRCA1 mutation status was not an independent predictor
of outcome, including freedom from distant metastasis,
breast cancer-specific and overall survival.
A number of retrospective series have reported a
similar or worse prognosis for women with BRCA-related
breast cancer compared with patients with sporadic breast
cancer. Early clinical reports were limited by a small number of BRCA mutation carriers and heterogeneous treatments. Furthermore, clinical and treatment factors were
often imbalanced due to the high-grade, estrogen receptor-negative nature of the cancers diagnosed in BRCA1
mutation carriers.19–23 Other studies did not differentiate
between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.19,24–26
Despite the limitations of earlier reports, a large population-based study from the Israeli National Cancer Registry found no difference in overall mortality or breast
cancer-specific mortality for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers compared with noncarriers.18 For the 76
BRCA1 and 52 BRCA2 carriers, the hazard ratio for death
from any cause and death from breast cancer were not significantly different between carriers and noncarriers after
adjusting for age, tumor size, lymph node status, and presence of metastasis. BRCA1 mutation carriers were less
likely to have estrogen receptor-positive tumors than noncarriers (24% vs 65%), but outcome by hormone receptor
status was not reported due to missing data in the majority
of cases. Of interest, the 10-year survival rates for women
who received adjuvant chemotherapy were 71% for carriers and 46% for noncarriers (HR 0.48, P ¼ .12). Among
women who did not receive chemotherapy, the 10-year
survival rates were 75% for carriers and 74% for noncarriers (HR 0.93, P ¼ .86). The difference in outcome
stratified by use of chemotherapy was not seen for BRCA2
mutation carriers. A second study by Robson et al found
that BRCA1 mutation status predicted for breast cancer
mortality only among women who did not receive chemotherapy (HR 4.8; range, 2.0-11.7), whereas survival rates
were similar for carriers and noncarriers treated with
chemotherapy (HR 1.5; range, 0.7-3.5).21 Neither of

3098

these reports, however, controlled for biologic subtype,
grade, or breast cancer histology.
In contrast to the similar outcomes for BRCA1
mutation carriers and noncarriers found in the current
study, others have described more clinical heterogeneity
among TN breast cancers. Gene expression array data suggest that the TN immunophenotype includes both the basal-like and normal breast subtype.13,27,28 Supporting this
notion, there is only moderate concordance between TN
and basal-like breast cancers; 56% to 84% of TN breast
cancers express basal cytokeratins and EGFR,29,30 and
conversely, 15% to 45% of basal-like cancers express ER,
PR, and/or HER2.14,28,31 A report from Rakha et al
defined basal and nonbasal subtypes of TN breast cancers
based on a distinct immunohistochemical profile of 3
basal cytokeratin markers (CK5/6, CK17, CK14) and
EGFR.32 Of 232 TN cases, 71% were positive for at least
1 of the 3 basal keratins and/or EGFR, and 29% were negative for all 4 basal markers. The basal-like subtype was
associated with BRCA1 mutation status (odds ratio 13),
improved response to chemotherapy, and shorter survival.
Among the basal-like cancers, there were more frequent
metastases to brain and lung compared with other lymph
node groups. Cheang et al also found that a 5-marker immunohistochemical panel including CK5/6 and EGFR
was a better predictor of outcome than the triple negative
definition.33 One possible explanation for the similar clinical outcomes observed in the current study is that a substantial proportion of sporadic TN breast cancers in this
cohort have a BRCA1-deficient or basal-like phenotype.
Alternatively, BRCA1 deficiency may not have prognostic significance in BRCA1-related or sporadic TN
breast cancer treated with alkylator-based chemotherapy.
Our cohort received a combination of alkylating and
anthracyline chemotherapy agents, which has been the
standard adjuvant chemotherapy backbone for the last
decade. Newer platinum-containing regimens as well as
poly- (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP-1) inhibitors have
shown substantial promise in BRCA-related breast cancers.34–37 In a recent report of 102 women with BRCA1related breast cancer, the pathologic complete response
(CR) rate for 12 patients treated with neo-adjuvant cisplatin on clinical study was 83% compared with 22% for the
51 BRCA1 mutation carriers who received AC in a retrospective comparison.34 It is therefore possible that alkylator or anthracycline-based chemotherapy does not exploit
the unique biologic defects that exist in BRCA1-deficient
breast cancers, although direct comparison of these chemotherapeutic agents will require a randomized trial.

Nonetheless, identifying the TN breast cancers that share
biologic similarities to BRCA1-related breast cancers will
likely aid in selecting appropriate patients for these
therapies.
In cohort studies, the clinical outcome of mutation
carriers may be affected by longevity selection, as the timing
of mutation testing may select for long-term survivors of
breast cancer. A strength of this study is that all 117 patients
included in the cohort had genetic testing within 36
months of diagnosis, either by commercial sequencing or
conformation-specific gel electrophoresis. This method was
validated at our institution and has a sensitivity of 97.4% in
detecting BRCA1 sequence changes,17 although it will not
detect complex gene rearrangements or mutations in the
BRCA2 gene that could result in misclassification. The limitations of this study include the small sample size and
retrospective nature that may introduce bias due to
unmeasured confounders and patient and treatment selection. With the current sample size, the study is underpowered to detect the observed effect, a hazard ratio of 0.73 for
breast cancer mortality for mutation carriers.
In summary, this study found that the clinical
outcome of TN breast cancer is similar in BRCA1
mutation carriers and noncarriers who received conventional alkylating chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting.
These findings may support the emerging biologic hypothesis of a BRCAness phenotype in a large proportion of TN breast cancers. Alternatively, alkylating and
anthracycline-based chemotherapy may not exploit the
biologic differences that may exist between BRCA1related and sporadic TN breast cancers. Correlative
studies are needed to identify women with sporadic
TN breast cancer who have a BRCA1-deficient phenotype and may benefit from therapies that target DNA
repair pathways. By understanding the heterogeneity of
TN breast cancers, we can provide better prognostic
information for our patients and improve our ability
to stratify patients for clinical trials based on molecular
subtype.
