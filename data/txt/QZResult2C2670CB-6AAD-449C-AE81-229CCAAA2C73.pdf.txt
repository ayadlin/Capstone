Abstract
Statins are widely used cholesterol-lowering drugs that
selectively inhibit the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
CoA reductase, leading to decreased cholesterol biosynthesis.
Emerging data indicate that statins stimulate apoptotic cell
death in several types of proliferating tumor cells, including
breast cancer cells, which is independent of its cholesterollowering property. The objective here was to elucidate the
molecular mechanism(s) by which statins induce breast
cancer cell death. Fluvastatin and simvastatin (5–10 Mmol/L)
treatment enhanced the caspase-3–like activity and DNA
fragmentation in MCF-7 cells, and significantly inhibited the
proliferation of MCF-7 cells but not MCF-10 cells (noncancerous epithelial cells). Statin-induced cytotoxic effects were
reversed by mevalonate, an immediate metabolic product of
the acetyl CoA/3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase
reaction. Both simvastatin and fluvastatin enhanced nitric
oxide ( NO) levels which were inhibited by mevalonate. Statininduced NO and tumor cell cytotoxicity were inhibited by
1400W, a more specific inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS or NOS II). Both fluvastatin and simvastatin
increased iNOS mRNA and protein expression. Stimulation of
iNOS by statins via inhibition of geranylgeranylation by GGTI298, but not via inhibition of farnesylation by FTI-277,
enhanced the proapoptotic effects of statins in MCF-7 cells.
Statin-mediated antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects
were exacerbated by sepiapterin, a precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential cofactor of NO biosynthesis by NOS.
We conclude that iNOS-mediated NO is responsible in part
for the proapoptotic, tumoricidal, and antiproliferative effects
of statins in MCF-7 cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7386–94]

statins: (a) natural or fermentation-derived: lovastatin (Mevacor),
simvastatin (Zocor), and pravastatin (Pravachol); (b) synthetic
statins: fluvastatin (Lescol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), cerivastatin
(Lipobay), and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Some statins such as
simvastatin and lovastatin are more hydrophobic (i.e., lipid-soluble)
than others (e.g., cerivastatin). A major biochemical function of
statins is the ability to lower lipid levels, in particular, plasma
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. However,
reports suggest that statins elicit vasoprotective and cardioprotective effects that are independent of their lipid-lowering effects
(9–11). The pleiotropic effects (i.e., actions independent of the
cholesterol-lowering property) of statins are dependent on their
structural property (i.e., hydrophobicity; ref. 12).
Emerging research suggests that statins may prevent various
types of cancers, including breast carcinoma, although results have
been mixed (13–15). Statins inhibit cancer cell proliferation by
arresting the cell cycle at the G1-S phase and inducing apoptosis
(16, 17). Recent studies have shown that fluvastatin markedly
attenuates epidermal growth factor–induced invasion of pancreatic
cancer cells by inhibiting the translocation of RhoA from the
cytosol to the membrane (18). Statins have been shown to inhibit
in vivo tumor growth at clinically relevant doses and to diminish
metastasis in animal models (19, 20). The objective of this study
was to determine the molecular mechanisms by which statins
exert cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cells. Results from
this study revealed that statin-induced inducible NO synthase
(iNOS)/NO activity and inhibition of geranylgeranylation play a key
role in enhancing MCF-7 cell apoptosis, and that supplementation
with sepiapterin exacerbates statin-mediated breast cancer cell
death via increased generation of NO.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
Statins, a class of hyperlipidemic blockbuster drugs, are routinely
used for lowering serum cholesterol in the treatment and
prevention of hypercholesterolemia and other cardiovascular
conditions (1–5). Statins are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins improve endothelial
and cardiovascular function by enhancing nitric oxide ( NO)
biosynthesis in endothelial cells (6–8). There are two groups of

Figure 1. Effects of statin and mevalonate
on cell death and cell proliferation in
MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. A, MCF-7
cells were treated with simvastatin or
fluvastatin (5–10 Amol/L) for 24 to 48 h
and cell survival was measured by the
MTT assay. B, MCF-7 and MCF-10A
cells were treated with simvastatin or
fluvastatin (5–10 Amol/L) for a period of
48 h and cell survival was measured by the
MTT assay. C, the effect of mevalonate
(20 Amol/L) on cell death induced by
simvastatin or fluvastatin was determined
using the MTT assay. D, the effects of
varying concentrations of simvastatin
and fluvastatin in the presence or
absence of mevalonate (20 Amol/L) on
cell proliferation were determined by
measuring 3H-thymidine uptake into cells
after a 48-h treatment. Columns, means
from three different experiments; bars,
SD. *, significantly different compared
with untreated conditions (P < 0.05);
#, significantly different compared with
simvastatin or fluvastatin alone (P < 0.05).

MCF-7 cells were washed twice with DPBS, resuspended in 1 mL of MEM
without FBS, and incubated with 5 mg/mL of MTT solution for 1 h at 37jC.
The medium was removed and the cells were solubilized in DMSO. The
absorption was measured at 562 nm with reference at 630 nm.
Thymidine uptake studies. DNA synthesis was measured by monitoring the uptake of tritiated thymidine, [3H]TdR (Perkin-Elmer). Cells
(5  105/mL) were cultured with different concentrations of simvastatin
or fluvastatin (0–10 Amol/L) in the presence or absence of mevalonate
(20 Amol/L), 1400W, or sepiapterin. Cells were pulse-chased with [3H]TdR
[0.5 ACi (0.185 MBq)/well] during the last 3 h of a 24-h culture, harvested
onto glass filters with an automatic cell harvester (Cambridge Technology),
and radioactivity on the filters was measured by h-scintillation counting.
All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated thrice.
Measurement of intracellular NO. Intracellular NO levels were
monitored using a DAF-2-DA fluorescence probe (21). After the treatments,
cells were washed with DPBS and incubated in 2 mL of fresh culture
medium without FBS. DAF-2-DA was added at a final concentration of
710 Amol/L, and cells were incubated for 20 min. Cells were washed twice
with DPBS and maintained in 1 mL of the culture medium for monitoring
the fluorescence using a Nikon fluorescence microscope (excitation, 488 nm;
emission, 610 nm) equipped with an FITC filter. Fluorescence intensity was
calculated using the Metamorph software.
Nitrite and nitrate measurements. Nitrite and nitrate, the oxidative
metabolites of NO, were measured by chemiluminescence, using a Sievers
apparatus, following reduction with vanadium (III) chloride (22). Briefly,
following treatments, the cells were washed thrice with DPBS and then
incubated for 30 min at 37jC in 1 mL of Hanks’ balanced salt mixture
containing 25 Amol/L of L-arginine. The medium was collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 rpm, and 50 AL of the clear supernatant was
used for nitrate and nitrite analysis. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
Western blot analysis. After treatment with statins, cells were washed
with ice-cold DPBS and resuspended in 150 AL of radioimmune
precipitation assay buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.5 mmol/L
EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 100 mmol/L
NaCl, and 100 mmol/L sodium fluoride] containing 1 mmol/L of sodium

vanadate, 10 Ag/mL of aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL of leupeptin, and 10 Ag/mL
of pepstatin inhibitors. Cells were homogenized by passing the suspension through a 25-gauge needle (20 strokes). The lysate was centrifuged at
750  g for 10 min at 4jC to pellet out the nuclei. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000  g. Protein was determined
using the Lowry method and 50 Ag of the lysate was used for the Western
blot analysis. Proteins were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gels and
blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were washed with
TBS (140 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl; pH 7.2) containing 0.1%
Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% skimmed milk to block nonspecific protein
binding. Membranes were incubated with 1 Ag/mL of rabbit anti-iNOS
polyclonal antibody (Abcam), mouse anti-cyclin D1 antibody, mouse anticyclin E antibody (BD Biosciences) or rabbit anti-p27 antibody (Chemicon International) in TBST for overnight at 4jC, washed five times
with TBST, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse
IgG horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000) for
1.5 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using
the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences).
RT-PCR analysis. Following the treatments, the medium was aspirated
and 1 mL of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was added and total RNA was
extracted using the manufacturer’s protocol. Five micrograms of RNA was
used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis using a first-strand cDNA synthesis
kit (Amersham Biosciences). Four microliters of the cDNA mixture was used
to amplify mRNAs from iNOS (5¶-CATGGCTTGCCCCTGGAAGTTTCT-3¶)
and (5¶-CCTCTATGGTGCCATCGGGCATC-3¶), arginase I (5¶-CTCTAAGGGACAGCCTCGAGGA-3¶) and (5¶-TGGGTTCACTTCCATGATATCTA-3¶),
arginase II (5¶-ATGTCCCTAAGGGGCAGCCTCTCGCGT-3¶) and (5¶-CACAGCTGTAGCCATCTGACACAGCTC-3¶), and eNOS (5¶-CCAGCTAGCCAAAGTCACCAT-3¶) and (5¶-GTCTCGGAGCCATACAGGATT-3¶).
Cell cycle analysis. For DNA content analysis, harvested cells were
centrifuged at 1,000  g for 5 min, fixed by the gradual addition of ice-cold
70% ethanol, and washed with PBS. Cells were then treated with RNase
(10 Ag/mL) for 30 min at 37jC, washed once with PBS, and resuspended
and stained in 1 mL of 69 Amol/L of propidium iodide in 38 mmol/L of
sodium citrate for 30 min at room temperature. The cell cycle phase

distribution was determined by analytic DNA flow cytometry as described
previously (23). The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was
analyzed using Modfit software (Verity Software House).
Soft agar assay for colony formation. After cells were treated under
various conditions, they were seeded in six-well plates. The plates were first
covered with phenol red–free MEM containing 0.6% agar and 10% FBS. The
middle layer contained cells (5  103) in phenol red–free MEM with 0.35%
agar and 10% FBS. The top layer, consisting of the medium, was added to
prevent drying of the agar in the plates. The plates were incubated for
21 days, after which the plates were stained in 0.5 mL of 0.005% crystal
violet for 1 h and the cultures were inspected and photographed. The colony
efficiency was determined by a count of the number of colonies >15 mm in
diameter, which was calculated as the average number of colonies counted
at 50 magnification in five individual fields manually (24).

Caspase-3–like proteolytic activity. Cells were washed twice in cold
DPBS and lysed in buffer containing 10 mmol/L of Tris-HCl, 10 mmol/L
of NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.5), 130 mmol/L of NaCl, 1% Triton, and
10 mmol/L of sodium PPi. Cell lysates were incubated with a caspase-3
fluorogenic substrate N-acetyl-DEVD-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin
at 37jC for 1 h. 7-Amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin liberated from the
substrate was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Perkin-Elmer
Life Sciences) with k ex = 400 nm and k em = 505 nm (25). The fluorescence
intensity was normalized to the protein levels measured with the Bradford
protein assay kit (Sigma).
Measurement of apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated nick-end labeling assay. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used for
microscopic detection of apoptosis (26). This assay is based on labeling

iNOS Statins and Breast Cancer Cell Apoptosis

Results
Statin-induced MCF-7 cell cytotoxicity. We assessed the
effectiveness of simvastatin and fluvastatin to induce cytotoxicity
in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with fluvastatin or simvastatin at different concentrations (0.5–20 Amol/L)
for 24 to 48 h. The changes in the number of viable cells were
determined using the MTT assay, which monitors the intracellular
conversion of MTT to formazan spectrophotometrically (k max =
562 nm). As shown in Fig. 1A, statins potently diminished the
number of viable MCF-7 cells. Statins induced cytotoxicity in both
MCF-7 breast cancer (malignant) cells (Fig. 1A and B) and MDAMB-231 (metastatic breast cancer cell lines; data not shown).
Fluvastatin and simvastatin did not affect noncancerous mammary epithelial cells, MCF-10A (Fig. 1B). To determine whether
statin-induced MCF-7 cell cytotoxicity was due to the inhibition
of HMG-CoA reductase activity, cells were pretreated with
mevalonate prior to adding simvastatin and fluvastatin. Results
show that mevalonate significantly reversed the cytotoxic effects
of statins (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the HMG-CoA reductase activity (leading to cholesterol biosynthesis or protein isoprenylation)
plays a pivotal role in statin-induced tumor cell cytotoxicity.
However, pretreatment with squalene, an immediate precursor
of cholesterol biosynthesis, did not prevent statin-induced
cytotoxicity (data not shown). This suggests that modulation of
isoprenylation of proteins may play a key role in statin-mediated
effects in MCF-7 cells.
To further confirm the loss of cell proliferation (as detected by
the MTT assay), we measured DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells treated
with simvastatin or fluvastatin for a period of 24 h and monitored
the uptake of 3H-thymidine during the last 3 h of the incubation.
As seen in Fig. 1D, both simvastatin and fluvastatin inhibited the
uptake of 3H-thymidine, and this inhibition was partially reversed
by mevalonate (Fig. 1D).
Role of L-arginine metabolizing enzymes in statin-induced
cytotoxicity. As statins are known to protect against endothelial
dysfunction by modulating the NOS and NO levels in endothelial
cells (6–8), we surmised that statins might also regulate NOS
and NO levels in MCF-7 cells. To this end, we initially measured
the DAF-2–derived green fluorescence. Both simvastatin and
fluvastatin significantly increased NO-mediated DAF fluorescence
(Fig. 2A). To identify the source of NO, we initially monitored
the eNOS protein levels by Western blotting in MCF-7 cells treated
with and without statins, and found no detectable eNOS protein
levels in control and treated MCF-7 cells (data not shown). However, quite unexpectedly, iNOS protein and iNOS mRNA levels were
up-regulated in cells treated with statins (Fig. 2B). To further confirm that increased expression of iNOS protein corresponds to
increased activity, we measured NO2 /NO3 levels in the medium.
Results indicate that statins increased NO2 /NO3 levels (Fig. 2B).
Mevalonate suppressed this increase in NO2 /NO3 levels (Fig. 2B),
indicating that HMG-CoA reductase–dependent pathways regulate
iNOS expression and regulation.
In addition to NOS-mediated oxidation of L-arginine to NO
and citrulline, L-arginine can also be metabolized by arginases to
L-ornithine and urea within the urea cycle and is subsequently
converted to polyamines (27). Polyamines are known to increase
cell proliferation (28). Because iNOS is significantly induced by
statin treatment, it was of interest to measure the levels of
arginases (Arg I and Arg II) in statin-treated MCF-7 cells. Arg I
transcript levels could not be detected in MCF-7 cells, but Arg II

catalyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Procedures were followed according to a commercially available kit (ApoAlert) from Clontech.
Apoptotic cells exhibit a strong nuclear green fluorescence that could
be detected using a standard fluorescein filter (520 nm). All cells stained
with propidium iodide exhibit a strong red cytoplasmic fluorescence at
620 nm. The apoptotic cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy
equipped with rhodamine and FITC filters. The quantification of apoptosis
was done using the Metamorph Image Analysis package.
Statistical analysis. Results were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA, and
differences estimated by a Student’s t test were considered to be statistically
significant at P < 0.05.

levels were significantly down-regulated in statin-treated cells
which was reversed by mevalonate (Fig. 2C). This result suggests
a ‘‘cross-talk’’ between arginase and iNOS that plays a role in
statin toxicity in MCF-7 cells. As statins increased NO levels, we
wondered whether N-nitroso-fluvastatin ( NO-fluvastatin) supplementation in MCF-7 would be more effective in causing MCF-7
cell death as compared with fluvastatin alone. NO-fluvastatin is
a hybrid molecule comprised of both statin and NO activities
(29). Results show that NO-fluvastatin was more potent than
fluvastatin alone in causing MCF-7 cell death (Fig. 2D). This
clearly implicates a major role for NO in statin-induced MCF-7
cell death.
Inhibition of geranylgeranylation by statins induces iNOS
expression and cell death in MCF-7 cells. The present data
showed that cholesterol-independent pathways were responsible
for statin-induced effects. Statins have been reported to deplete
the availability of prenylated substrates (30). Posttranslational
prenylation of small GTPases by the addition of a geranylgeranyl or
farnesyl moiety is critical for cellular localization and signaling
activity (31). To further confirm the involvement of isoprenoids
on statin-induced, iNOS-dependent cell death, we investigated the
effects of isoprenylation inhibitors. Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells
with geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI-298), but not farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI-277) decreased the number of viable
cells, as indicated by the MTT assay (Fig. 3A), and decreased cell

proliferation, as indicated by diminished 3H-thymidine uptake
(Fig. 3B). To investigate whether inhibition of geranylgeranylation
or farnesylation was responsible for enhanced iNOS expression,
iNOS protein levels were measured in the presence of either GGTI298 or FTI-277. As shown, GGTI and not FTI-277 dose-dependently
increased iNOS protein levels (Fig. 3C). Concomitantly, inhibition
of geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation, increased NO2 /NO3
levels (Fig. 3D). However, treatment of noncancerous mammary
epithelial cells with fluvastatin and simvastatin did not induce
NO2 /NO3 levels (Supplemental Fig. S1). Based on these results, we
conclude that GGTI mimics the effects of statins, and therefore, it
is likely that statin-mediated iNOS/ NO induction and cytostatic/
cytotoxic effects in MCF-7 cells occur through reduced geranylgeranylation of downstream signaling targets, such as Rho or Rac
GTPases.
Contrasting effects of iNOS inhibitor and iNOS activator on
statin-induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis. Pretreatment with 1400W,
a specific inhibitor of iNOS (32), partially reversed the statindependent antiproliferative effects (Fig. 4A) and diminished
statin-dependent NO2 /NO3 generation (Fig. 4B). Conversely,
treatment with sepiapterin (which is a precursor of the NOS
cofactor BH4) significantly enhanced the statin-dependent increase in NO2 /NO3 levels (Fig. 4B). Sepiapterin also enhanced
the GGTI-298–dependent increase in NO2 /NO3 levels (compare
Figs. 3D with 4C). Sepiapterin treatment alone or in the presence

statin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5). Treatment with simvastatin or
fluvastatin promotes apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase3–like activity in the cells (Fig. 5A) and increased TUNEL staining
(Fig. 5B). These statin-induced indicators of apoptosis were
diminished by treatment with the iNOS inhibitor 1400W and
enhanced by treatment with sepiapterin (Fig. 5A and B). Taken
together, these results indicate that NO modulation plays a key
role in the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of statins in
tumor cells.
Effect of statins on cell cycle distribution: role of NO. As
NO has previously been reported to exert tumor cell cycle
alterations (33), we investigated the cytostatic effect of statins
in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were treated with simvastatin
and fluvastatin for 48 h in the presence and absence of 1400W
(10 Amol/L) and mevalonate (20 Amol/L). Cell cycle progression
was examined using FACScan flow cytometry analysis. As shown in
Table 1, both simvastatin and fluvastatin (5–10 Amol/L) arrested
MCF-7 cells in G0/G1 phase, and as a result, the number of cells
in the S phase was decreased. Similar effects were observed with
NO-fluvastatin at a much lower concentration (1 Amol/L) as
compared with native fluvastatin (Table 1). Statin-induced cell
cycle alterations were partially reversed by the iNOS inhibitor
(1400W) and almost completely reversed by mevalonate (Table 1).
As cell cycle progression from G0 through G1 phase involves
activation of the cell regulatory proteins, cyclins D and E, we
investigated the effects of statins and iNOS inhibitor on the cell
cycle proteins. As expected, the cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin
D1 and cyclin E (which are responsible for driving the cell cycle
progression from G0/G1 to S phase transition) were significantly
decreased with statin treatments and restored in part by 1400W
or mevalonate (Fig. 6A). The levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor, p27, were also down-regulated by statin treatments
(Fig. 6A). Therefore, under our experimental conditions, it seems
that the decrease in cell cycle regulatory proteins was independent

of FTI-277 had no effect on NO2 /NO3 levels (Fig. 4B and C).
These findings support the model that statin-mediated inhibition
of geranylgeranylation causes an iNOS-dependent increase in
NO2 /NO3 levels, which promotes cell death or loss of cell
proliferation. Consistent with this model, we found that 1400W
partially suppresses the antiproliferative effects of GGTI-298
(Fig. 4D), just as 1400W partially suppresses the antiproliferative
effects of statins (Fig. 4A). Further support for this model is
provided by the contrasting effects of 1400W and sepiapterin on

of the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor(s) and
possibly other cdk-independent regulatory mechanisms are involved.
Effects of statins on anchorage-independent growth of
MCF-7 cells. The extent of malignancy of cells corresponds to
the attainment of anchorage-independent growth (34). To test
the effects of statins on anchorage-independent growth, the longterm effects of statins, GGTI, and FTI on the clonogenic growth
of MCF-7 cells were determined. MCF-7 cells were treated with
simvastatin or fluvastatin in the presence or absence of either
1400W or mevalonate or sepiapterin. In separate experiments,
cells were treated with either GGTI-298 or FTI-277. At the end of
the treatments, f5  103 cells were seeded onto soft agar to
determine their clonogenic efficiency after 21 days. Simvastatin
and fluvastatin (10 Amol/L) and GGTI-298 (10 Amol/L) but not
FTI-277 (10 Amol/L) drastically lowered the visible colony
formation in soft agar (Fig. 6B). In the presence of either 1400W
or mevalonate, the colony formation was restored in statin-treated
cells (Fig. 6B). Sepiapterin supplementation completely inhibited
the colony growth at a lower concentration of simvastatin or
fluvastatin (5 Amol/L; Fig. 6B). For quantitative estimation of the
number of colonies, please refer to Supplemental Fig. S2. Taken
together, these results indicate that statins are able to inhibit cell
proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells by
modulating NO levels through a pathway involving the inhibition
of geranylgeranylation.

Discussion
In this study, we report the following: (a) statins diminish
proliferation and promote apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells
through elevation of inducible NOS expression and NO formation
from oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline using BH4 as a cofactor;
(b) supplementation with sepiapterin, a precursor to BH4
biosynthesis, enhanced statin-mediated proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects in MCF-7 cells; (c) statin-mediated tumoricidal
effects occur through inhibition of geranylgeranylation and not
through inhibition of farnesylation.
Statins as cancer-therapeutic/cancer-preventive agents.
Recently, statins have been studied as potential cancer therapeutics. As early as 1992, it was reported that lovastatin treatment
diminished tumor cell proliferation in xenografts of pancreatic
cancer in nude mice (35). Epidemiologic studies support the
effectiveness of statins as anticancer therapeutics (36–39). Cancer
cells usually exhibit constitutively elevated levels of HMG-CoA
reductase and low-density lipid receptor levels to satisfy their
increased need for isoprenoids and lipids, and potentially making
them more sensitive than normal cells to the isoprenoid-depleting
effects of statins (40). The clinical reports on the antitumor effects
of statins in breast cancer have yielded mixed results, ranging
from no association to both positive and negative associations
(41, 42). However, results from a recent study conducted in a
large population of postmenopausal women with breast cancer
concluded that there exists a significant beneficial association
between breast cancer and hydrophobic or lipophilic statin therapy
(43). However, when statins were considered together as a class
including both hydrophobic and hydrophilic statins, no statistically
significant association with breast cancer regression was detected
in the same group (43). For instance, the use of pravastatin
(hydrophilic statin) did not show any positive effect in association
with breast cancer (43). This lack of an in vivo effect of pravastatin

iNOS Statins and Breast Cancer Cell Apoptosis

was consistent with the results of in vitro cell culture studies in
which only hydrophobic statins (e.g., lovastatin) but not hydrophilic statins (e.g., pravastatin) induced significant antiproliferative and antitumor effects in breast cancer cells. These findings
have been confirmed by other investigators (17). By and large,
the in vitro cell culture experiments are a reasonable predictor of
the in vivo antitumor and/or chemopreventive effects of statins
in mammary carcinogenesis models (17). Therefore, defining the
biological mechanisms by which statins induce apoptosis and
exert antiproliferative effects in breast tumor cells is important.
The present study shows a novel mechanism by which statins
(lipophilic) exert proapoptotic effects in MCF-7 cells.
NO as a tumoricidal agent. The cytostatic and cytotoxic
effects of NO in tumor cells are well-established (33, 44, 45).
Potential strategies for treating cancer through modulation of NO
biosynthesis and its downstream signaling pathway have previously
been described (45). Inducible NOS activity has been implicated
in macrophage-induced antitumor activity. Tumor cells transfected
with iNOS gene (NOS II gene) exhibited a less aggressive phenotype
in both in vitro and in vivo assays due to increased apoptosis (46).
Inducible NOS gene transfection in human lung carcinoma cells
was shown to down-regulate the expression of the antiapoptotic
protein, survivin (47), leading to enhanced tumor cell death.
The geranylgeranylated members of the Rho family of small
GTPases may participate in the statin-mediated increase of NO
levels in MCF-7 cells. This probability is supported by our
finding that GGTI mimics the effects of statins by increasing
iNOS expression, increasing NO levels, and decreasing the
proliferation of the cells. Previous studies indicate that inhibiting
isoprenylation of RhoA with statins or GGTI, or inhibiting the
RhoA activity with bacterial toxins, increases NO levels in a
variety of cell types. RhoA can modulate NO levels by regulating
iNOS expression (48, 49). Thus, the loss of RhoA activity in statintreated cells may contribute to increased iNOS expression and
elevated NO levels.
NO production is compromised by the interplay between NOS,
arginases, and arginosuccinate synthetase in tumor cells (27).
L-Arginine is a common substrate for both NOS and arginase
enzymes. L-Arginine is oxidized by NOS enzymes to L-citrulline and
NO through the formation of an intermediate, N-hydroxyL-arginine, which is also a potent competitive inhibitor of arginase.
Arginase, both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms, metabolizes
L-arginine to L-ornithine, the precursor of polyamines that are
essential for cell proliferation (27). Although the K m for arginine is
1,000-fold higher for arginase as compared with the NOS enzymes,
the V max of arginase is >1,000 times that of the NOS enzymes (27).
This suggests similar rates of L-arginine utilization by arginase and
NOS enzymes. Thus, NO production can be regulated by controlling the availability of L-arginine, by inhibiting the arginase
enzyme, or by stimulating the NOS activity. In MCF-7 cells, we
were able to detect only Arg II transcript levels, but not Arg I levels,
and its levels were significantly decreased by statin treatments.
Sepiapterin enhances statin-mediated proapoptotic effects.
BH4 is an indispensable cofactor for NO generation by all isoforms
of NOS (50). In the absence of BH4, NOS switches its activity from
NO synthesis to superoxide generation (Supplemental Fig. S2).
Inducible NOS transfection of fibroblast cells deficient in BH4
synthesizing enzymatic machinery failed to produce NO in the
absence of exogenous supplementation with BH4 (50). This clearly
shows the critical need for intracellular BH4 for iNOS-dependent

generation of NO. De novo biosynthesis of BH4 is catalyzed by
guanosine-5¶-triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase 1. Mammalian
cells can also generate BH4 by a ‘‘salvage pathway’’ which converts
sepiapterin to BH4 by sepiapterin reductase and dihydrofolate
reductase (50). Intracellular BH4 is also manipulated by inhibiting
either GTP cyclohydrolase 1 with 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine, or dihydrofolate reductase using methotrexate. Alternatively,
treatment of cells with sepiapterin or 7,8-dihydrobiopterin
increases BH4. Thus, pharmacologic manipulation of BH4 levels is
a good strategy to modulate NO in cancer cells. Determining how
statins modulate L-arginine metabolism through the arginase and
iNOS pathways would likely have a significant effect on our
understanding of the stimulation and inhibition of breast cancer
growth. As shown in the present study, treatment of MCF-7 cells
with sepiapterin enhances the potency of statins via enhanced
synthesis of NO. As shown in Supplemental Fig. S3, supplementation with drugs activating iNOS activity may synergistically
enhance statin-induced antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects
in breast cancer cells.
Role of NO as a cytostatic agent. Recent research suggests
that one of the potential areas of intervention to arrest breast
cancer progression is to block the activity of HMG-CoA reductase
and lower the levels of mevalonate and other products (39). This
pathway controls critical cellular functions including cell signaling
and cell cycle progression associated with tumor initiation and
tumor metastasis. Cell cycle progression is mainly governed by the
activity of a family of protein kinases (cdk). Cyclins were shown to
promote cell cycle transitions by binding and activating specific
cdks. Cyclin D is involved in the early to mid-G1 phase, whereas
cyclin E activation occurs in the late G1 to early S phase (Fig. 6C).
The molecular mechanism(s) by which statins induce G1 arrest in
breast cancer cells are not known. The present results show that
statins inhibit cyclin D and cyclin E expression in MCF-7 cells, and
that this inhibition was abrogated by pretreatment with mevalonate and 1400W, a selective inhibitor of iNOS (Fig. 5A). This finding
implicates a role for statin-derived NO in the modulation of the
cell cycle regulatory proteins (Fig. 5A). Previous reports have
shown that DETA-NONOate, a nitric oxide donor, induced cytostasis in human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, and that the
arrest of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle was accompanied by
cyclin D1 down-regulation (33). However, our results show that
although cyclin D1 and cyclin E were significantly down-regulated
by statins, it seems that these events were not controlled by cdk
inhibitor p27, the levels of which were also decreased with statin
treatments. These results were consistent with a recent report
showing that the decrease in cell cycle regulatory proteins by statin
treatments was not dependent on p21 and p27 protein levels in
prostate cancer cells (16).
In conclusion, the present study shows, for the first time, that (a)
NO generated via the induction of iNOS by selective inhibition of
geranylgeranylation plays an important role in statin-induced cell
death in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and (b) supplementation with
sepiapterin exacerbates the proapoptotic effects of statins in these
cells through augmentation of NO synthesis.
