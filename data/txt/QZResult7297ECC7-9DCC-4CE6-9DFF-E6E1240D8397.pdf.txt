Abstract
We describe the biological properties of NVP-AUY922, a
novel resorcinylic isoxazole amide heat shock protein 90
(HSP90) inhibitor. NVP-AUY922 potently inhibits HSP90
(K d = 1.7 nmol/L) and proliferation of human tumor cells
with GI50 values of approximately 2 to 40 nmol/L, inducing G1-G2 arrest and apoptosis. Activity is independent of
NQO1/DT-diaphorase, maintained in drug-resistant cells and
under hypoxic conditions. The molecular signature of HSP90
inhibition, comprising induced HSP72 and depleted client
proteins, was readily demonstrable. NVP-AUY922 was glucuronidated less than previously described isoxazoles, yielding
higher drug levels in human cancer cells and xenografts. Daily
dosing of NVP-AUY922 (50 mg/kg i.p. or i.v.) to athymic mice
generated peak tumor levels at least 100-fold above cellular
GI50. This produced statistically significant growth inhibition
and/or regressions in human tumor xenografts with diverse
oncogenic profiles: BT474 breast tumor treated/control, 21%;
A2780 ovarian, 11%; U87MG glioblastoma, 7%; PC3 prostate,
37%; and WM266.4 melanoma, 31%. Therapeutic effects were
concordant with changes in pharmacodynamic markers,
including induction of HSP72 and depletion of ERBB2, CRAF,
cyclin-dependent kinase 4, phospho-AKT/total AKT, and
hypoxia-inducible factor-1A, determined by Western blot,
electrochemiluminescent immunoassay, or immunohistochemistry. NVP-AUY922 also significantly inhibited tumor cell
chemotaxis/invasion in vitro , WM266.4 melanoma lung
metastases, and lymphatic metastases from orthotopically
implanted PC3LN3 prostate carcinoma. NVP-AUY922 inhibited proliferation, chemomigration, and tubular differentiation of human endothelial cells and antiangiogenic activity
was reflected in reduced microvessel density in tumor xenografts. Collectively, the data show that NVP-AUY922 is a

potent, novel inhibitor of HSP90, acting via several processes
(cytostasis, apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis) to inhibit
tumor growth and metastasis. NVP-AUY922 has entered phase
I clinical trials. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2850–60]

Introduction
The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an
exciting target in oncology (1–3). It supports the correct conformation, stabilization, activation, and localization of ‘‘client’’
proteins, many of which are involved in tumor progression (4).
Targeting several pathways is essential to prevent tumor cell
‘‘escape’’ and development of drug resistance (3). The therapeutic
efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors probably relates to the combinatorial
blockade of multiple signaling pathways (3, 5, 6) and the increased
levels of active HSP90 in tumors (7, 8), in some cases linked to
clinical outcome (9). Tumors may also become addicted to pathways dependent on activated, mutated, or overexpressed client
proteins, the mutated forms of which (e.g., BRAF) are often
hypersensitive to HSP90 inhibitors (10, 11). Thus, for a variety of
reasons, inhibition of HSP90 has considerable clinical potential.
The geldanamycin class of HSP90 inhibitors has been extensively
evaluated. Geldanamycin analogues, specifically 17-allylamino17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG; tanespimycin), 17-(dimethylaminoethyl-amino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG;
alvespimycin), and the 17-AAG hydroquinone IPI-504, have been
developed as less toxic and/or more soluble drugs (12, 13). 17-AAG
and 17-DMAG have been in several phase I and II clinical trials
where some disease stabilization and tumor responses were seen
(14–16). However, this compound series has limitations, including
formulation difficulties, hepatotoxicity, variable pharmacokinetics,
and polymorphic metabolism by CYP3A4 (17) and NQO1/DTdiaphorase enzymes (18), together with efflux by P-glycoprotein
(18). Nevertheless, these agents have been invaluable for showing
proof of principle of therapeutic benefit preclinically and clinically,
for establishing and validating robust biomarkers of target modulation (14, 19, 20), and for identifying additional activities, including
inhibition of tumor invasion (21, 22) and angiogenesis (23, 24).
Other natural product HSP90 inhibitors include the macrolide
radicicol and its derivatives (25). Radicicol is poorly soluble and
inactive in vivo, although semisynthetic oxime derivatives have
improved pharmacokinetics and exhibit antitumor activity (25).

Characterization of Novel HSP90 Inhibitor NVP-AUY922

However, these have not entered clinical development, possibly due
to reported ocular toxicity (26).
There has been considerable effort to design synthetic smallmolecule inhibitors based on the X-ray crystal structure of HSP90.
Purine scaffold derivatives (e.g., PU3) showed parenteral activity in
human tumor xenografts and soluble analogues exhibited oral
antitumor activity at relatively high doses (27, 28). An oral purine
scaffold compound (BIIBO21) is in clinical trial (29).
A second class of synthetic HSP90 inhibitors is the pyrazole
resorcinols (Fig. 1A), initially exemplified by CCT018159 (30–32).
Subsequent structure-based design generated more potent
resorcinylic pyrazole/isoxazole amide analogues (33, 34) and the
significantly improved isoxazole resorcinol NVP-AUY922 (VER52296). NVP-AUY922 is the most potent synthetic small-molecule
HSP90 inhibitor yet described (35). We now report on the detailed
in vitro activity and in vivo pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic,
and efficacy profiles of NVP-AUY922 in a wide spectrum of

human tumor cell lines and xenografts with different molecular
pathologies and including orthotopic and metastatic models.
These results support the selection of NVP-AUY922 for clinical
development.

Materials and Methods
NVP-AUY922 synthesis, activity, and selectivity. NVP-AUY922 was
synthesized as described (35). Its activity was assayed against HSP90a,
HSP90h, GRP94, TRAP-1, HSP72, and topoisomerase II (31, 34). Profiling against a panel of kinases was carried out and screening against a
panel of additional enzymes and receptors was performed at Cerep. X-ray
crystallography, fluorescence polarization, and isothermal calorimetry were
as described (35–37).
Cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Unless otherwise stated,
cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in
DMEM/10% FCS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and nonessential amino acids in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air as described (Supplementary

2.0 Å, and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively. For atomic coordinates and structure factors, see PDB codes 2CVI, 2UWD, and 2BSM, respectively.

information; refs. 23, 31, 34). All lines were free of Mycoplasma (Venor GeM
kit, Minerva Biolabs). Cell proliferation was determined using the
sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (18) for tumor cells and prostate epithelial
cells, the WST-1 assay (Roche Diagnostics Ltd.) for MCF10A and HB119,
or an alkaline phosphatase assay (23) for HUVEC and HDMEC. GI50 was
the compound concentration inhibiting cell proliferation by 50% compared with vehicle controls. Cell cycle analysis was as described (31).
Active caspase-3/7 was measured using a homogenous caspase assay kit
(Promega).
Molecular biomarkers and tumor cell and endothelial cell activities.
Effects of NVP-AUY922 on the expression of client proteins [e.g., CRAF,
BRAF, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), ERBB2, AKT, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)] and on induction of HSP72 were
determined in human tumor and endothelial cells (31, 34). Tumor cell
chemotaxis, haptotaxis, invasion, and endothelial cell functions related to
angiogenesis were also determined as described (23) with minor variations
(see figure legends).
Measurement of NVP-AUY922 in biological samples. Microsomal
incubations were performed with mouse and human liver preparations and
human carcinoma cell uptake studies were as described (34). Given the
relatively low GI50 for NVP-AUY922 in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, we used
5  GI50 for cell uptake studies and equimolar concentrations in HT29 cells.
Xenograft pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in female NCr athymic mice bearing WM266.4 human
melanoma xenografts were essentially as described (34). NVP-AUY922 was
dissolved in DMSO and diluted in sterile saline/Tween 20. A single dose of
50 mg/kg NVP-AUY922 was given i.v. or i.p. and groups of three animals
were taken at intervals for pharmacokinetic analyses. Further details are in
Supplementary information.
For efficacy studies, human tumor xenografts were established s.c. in
athymic mice. WM266.4 cells were also injected i.v. to generate
experimental lung metastases and PC3LN3 prostate carcinoma cells were
implanted into the prostates of male mice. Dosing with NVP-AUY922
commenced when tumors were well established using schedules described.
Tumor growth was monitored and at study end samples were harvested for
analysis. Further details are provided in Supplementary information.
Biomarker analyses by Western blotting, immunoassay, and
immunohistochemistry. Snap-frozen tumors were lysed, protein concentration was determined, and standard Western blotting procedures were
followed (34). The levels of phospho-AKT and/or total AKT, HSP72, ERBB2,
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and hypoxia-inducible
factor-1a (HIF-1a) in treated and control tumor xenografts were determined by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (Meso Scale Discovery).
Cryopreserved tumors were sectioned and stained for phosphoproteins.
Details are in Supplementary information. Tumor microvessel density was
determined as described (23).

Results
NVP-AUY922 binds to the NH2-terminal nucleotide site in
HSP90. The X-ray cocrystal structure of NVP-AUY922 (Fig. 1A)
bound to the NH2-terminal domain of recombinant human
HSP90a is shown in Fig. 1B and C. This confirms the crucial network of hydrogen bonding interactions involving the resorcinol
residue and heterocyclic ring with Asp93, Thr184, and a cluster of
structurally conserved and highly ordered water molecules, as for
CCT018159, VER-49009, and VER-50589 (31, 33, 34). In addition,
as observed with VER-49009 and VER-50589, the C-5 ethylamide
residue of NVP-AUY922 provides additional hydrogen bonding
interactions with the protein backbone via Lys58 and Gly97, the
latter being particularly important (33). Replacement of the chlorine of the resorcinol ring in VER-49009 or VER-50589 by an
isopropyl group in NVP-AUY922 results in an additional hydrophobic interaction with Leu107 in the flexible lipophilic pocket
(Fig. 1C). Further hydrophobic interactions are also seen with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

Thr109 and Gly135 when the methoxy group of VER-49009 or VER50589 is replaced with the morpholino moiety of NVP-AUY922.
The morpholine ring is located close to the surface of the protein
(Fig. 1B). The two orthogonal views of the superimposition of
VER-49009, VER-50589, and NVP-AUY922 show that all three
compounds bind with overall similarity (Fig. 1D).
NVP-AUY922 is a potent and selective HSP90 inhibitor. The
competitive binding fluorescence polarization assay gave an IC50
for NVP-AUY922 of 21 F 16 nmol/L against HSP90h (35) and of
7.8 F 1.8 nmol/L for HSP90a. Inhibitory kinetics were competitive
and the K i values were 9.0 F 5.0 nmol/L and 8.2 F 0.7 nmol/L for
HSP90a and HSP90h, respectively (mean F SE, n = 3). Isothermal
calorimetry showed a very high binding affinity to HSP90h with
a K d of 1.7 F 0.5 nmol/L, 3-fold lower than VER-50589 (34).
The enthalpy of binding of NVP-AUY922 is 12.24 kcal/mol,
f3 kcal/mol more favorable than for VER-50589 (34). The entropy
of binding of NVP-AUY922 is almost negligible (0.19 cal/mol/K),
indicating that the binding event is driven essentially exclusively
by enthalpy (i.e., bonding interactions). NVP-AUY922 exhibits the
tightest binding of any small-molecule HSP90 ligand yet reported.
The IC50 values for NVP-AUY922 against the HSP90 family members GRP94 and TRAP-1 were 535 F 51 nmol/L (K i = 108 nmol/L)
and 85 F 8 nmol/L (K i = 53 nmol/L), respectively, indicating weaker
potency than for HSP90. The fluorescence polarization IC50 for
binding to HSP90 in human cell lysates was in the range of 6.0 F 1.8
to 13.7 F 1.4 with no clear differences between tumor cells (HCT116
and WM266.4) and nontumorigenic cells (HUVEC and PNT2 prostate epithelial cells). NVP-AUY922 at 10 Amol/L showed no inhibition of human HSP72 ATPase or the decatenation activity of human
topoisomerase II and little or no activity against a range of 13 kinases
(Supplementary Table S1). In a screen of 14 additional enzymes and 67
receptors, NVP-AUY922 exhibited >50% inhibitory activity at 10 Amol/L
against only 6 receptors and 1 enzyme; further profiling showed
NVP-AUY922 to be >50-fold selective for HSP90 (data not shown).
NVP-AUY922 potently inhibits proliferation of multiple
human tumor cell lines in vitro. NVP-AUY922 inhibited with
nanomolar potency (2.3–49.6 nmol/L) the in vitro proliferation of
human tumor cells selected for their different tissue origins and
molecular features (Supplementary Table S2). Unlike the geldanamycin-based HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG (18, 38), NVP-AUY922 activity
is independent of NQO1/DT-diaphorase activity because sensitivity
was similar in BEneg human colon carcinoma cells carrying an
inactivating NQO1 polymorphism and isogenic BE2 cells transfected with the NQO1 gene and also in SKMEL2 (high NQO1) and
SKMEL5 (low NQO1) melanoma cells. Activity was maintained in
doxorubicin-resistant CH1 ovarian carcinoma cells overexpressing
P-glycoprotein and in oxaliplatin-resistant HT29 colon carcinoma
cells. In addition, unlike some cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy,
NVP-AUY922 was equally effective under hypoxic conditions. In
PC3 and DU145 prostate carcinoma cells exposed to NVP-AUY922
in 20% or 1% O2, the ratios of GI50 values were 1.17 and 1.20,
respectively, whereas for paclitaxel the GI50 values were increased
by 3.8- and 5.6-fold under hypoxia (data not shown). Nontumorigenic human prostate (PNT2 and Pre2.8) and breast (MCF10A and
HB119) epithelial cells, at least when actively proliferating, showed
similar sensitivity to NVP-AUY922 as tumor cells, as also seen
with 17-AAG. Human endothelial cells (HUVEC and HDMEC) were
among the most sensitive (Supplementary Table S2).
NVP-AUY922 induced marked accumulation in either G1 or
G1 plus G2-M phases in most cell lines. More detailed analysis

bivariate Hoechst-propidium iodide flow cytometry showed that
NVP-AUY922 arrested HCT116 colon carcinoma cells in the
original G1 and G2-M as early as 8 h (Fig. 2A). By 16 h, cells in S
phase that had traversed to the new G2* phase remained blocked
over 72 h. The ability of NVP-AUY922 to induce apoptosis was cell
line dependent. Activated caspase-3/7 levels rapidly increased in
BT474 cells following exposure to NVP-AUY922 and apoptosis was
confirmed by Western blotting for cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (data not shown). In WM266.4 melanoma cells,
activated caspase-3/7 increased moderately, whereas in MDAMB-231 breast carcinoma and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells no
increase was observed (Fig. 2B). Further analysis revealed that cell
death could occur independently of caspase activation. Following
72-h exposure to 6 to 8  GI50 concentrations of NVP-AUY922, the
fraction of either BT474 or MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells
remaining was approximately 15% to 18% of pretreatment levels
(Fig. 2C). In contrast, exposure of HCT116 colon carcinoma cells to
8  GI50 NVP-AUY922 resulted in virtually no cell death, suggesting a
predominantly cytostatic effect in this cell line.
These observations were confirmed by colony formation assays.
The concentration of NVP-AUY922 required to reduce colony
numbers to <1% following 24-h exposure was f32 nmol/L for
MDA-MB-231 cells but 250 nmol/L in HCT116 cells. This is not due
to lack of client protein depletion as exposure of HCT116 cells to
5  GI50 NVP-AUY922 led to a rapid depletion of CRAF and ERBB2
and concomitant induction of HSP72 (Fig. 2D). Despite being

extremely sensitive to growth inhibition by NVP-AUY922, SKBR3
breast carcinoma cells also underwent cytostasis following
exposure to NVP-AUY922 or 17-AAG (data not shown).
NVP-AUY922 shows high uptake in HCT116 human colon
carcinoma cell lines in vitro. HT29 colon carcinoma cells express
uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases, whereas HCT116
cells do not (31, 39). At equimolar concentrations, initially high
uptake was seen in both cell lines; however, f3-fold more NVPAUY922 was detected in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells following 1-h exposure (547.7 F 4.5 pmol/10 million cells in HCT116
versus 172.0 F 10.0 in HT29). Levels increased from 1 to 24 h to
687.0 F 1.7 pmol/10 million cells in HCT116 cells but were hardly
detectable at 24 h in HT29 cells (4.2 F 0.8 pmol/10 million cells).
This suggests that glucuronidation of NVP-AUY922 during this
period results in the reduced sensitivity in HT29 cells compared
with HCT116 cells.
NVP-AUY922 depletes HSP90 client proteins in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The molecular signature
of HSP90 inhibition comprises induction of HSP72 coupled with
depletion of client proteins in a concentration- and timedependent manner (14, 19). Biomarker changes were observed in
HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (Fig. 2D) and in A2780 ovarian,
SKMEL2 and WM266.4 melanoma, and BT474 breast carcinoma
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A–D). HSP72 levels were increased
from 8 to 72 h. ERBB2 was almost completely depleted in all cell
lines for the duration of the study. BRAF (both wild-type and

mutant forms in the SKMEL2 and WM266.4 cells, respectively) and
CRAF were also depleted by NVP-AUY922 treatment. CDK4 levels
showed cell-dependent responses (as previously noted with
other HSP90 inhibitors) with decreased expression in most cell
lines except WM266.4 and recovery evident between 72 and
96 h (Supplementary Fig. S1A; Fig. 2D).
Analysis of two key signaling events in BT474 breast carcinoma
cells (phosphorylation of ERBB2 Tyr1240 and AKT Ser345) indicated
that NVP-AUY922 inhibited pathway activation at lower concentrations than those required to induce complete client protein
depletion (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In SKBR3 breast carcinoma
cells treated for 24 h with 4  GI50 NVP-AUY922, ERBB2 was
predominantly cytoplasmic rather than membrane bound as in
control cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
NVP-AUY922 inhibits tumor cell chemomigration, invasion, and haptotaxis. Several HSP90 client proteins are
implicated in cell motility and invasion (23, 24). Chemomigration
of metastatic PC3LN3 prostate carcinoma cells in FluoroBlok
assays was inhibited by 54% and 68% with 50 and 125 nmol/L
(f2  GI50 and 5  GI50) of NVP-AUY922. Similar effects
were seen in Matrigel-coated filter invasion assays (Fig. 3A). In
addition, in a scratch wound haptotaxis assay, PC3LN3 cells
completed wound closure by 24 h, whereas cells exposed to
125 nmol/L NVP-AUY922 achieved only 60% closure at 48
h (Supplementary Fig. S4A). The rate of movement of PC3LN3
cells in the haptotaxis assay was also determined. Untreated
cells moved on average 9.7 F 1.1 Am/h and this rate was
reduced to 56%, 40%, and 28% of controls by 50, 125, and 250
nmol/L of NVP-AUY922 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). WM266.4
melanoma cell migration and invasion were also very sensitive
to NVP-AUY922: 50 nmol/L induced 90% and 78% inhibition,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
NVP-AUY922 inhibits endothelial cell functions related to
angiogenesis in vitro. Human endothelial cells were highly sensitive
to NVP-AUY922 in proliferation assays (GI50 = 2.5–3.9 nmol/L).
In addition, HUVEC migration was inhibited in a concentrationdependent manner following 24-h exposure to NVP-AUY922
(Fig. 3B). At f1  GI50 concentrations (5 nmol/L), FCS-mediated
chemomigration was reduced to 68% of controls, decreasing to 24%
at 25 nmol/L. VEGF-driven HUVEC migration was even more
sensitive: concentrations as low as 1 nmol/L inhibited chemotaxis
by 50%, with complete inhibition at 2.5 nmol/L and above (Fig. 3C).
HUVEC haptotaxis in a wound closure assay was also inhibited
(data not shown). NVP-AUY922 inhibited HUVEC tubular differentiation on Matrigel in a concentration-dependent manner, with
>80% inhibition at 25 nmol/L (Fig. 3D). We confirmed that HSP72
was induced and key angiogenic client proteins (including AKT
and VEGFR2) were depleted concordantly, as measured by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (Supplementary Fig. S3A–C) and
Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
NVP-AUY922 shows limited metabolism and favorable
pharmacokinetics. Incubation of 10 Amol/L NVP-AUY922 with
mouse and human liver microsomes for 30 min resulted in 69 F 4%
and 59 F 15% metabolism (mean F SE, n = 3), respectively,
considerably less than the isoxazole VER-50589, which showed
71 F 5% metabolism at 5 min and complete metabolism after
15 min of incubation (34). The main NVP-AUY922 metabolites
measured in mouse plasma were the glucuronide of the parent,
a deethylated product, and an oxidation product. The glucuronide
represented f95% of plasma metabolites as estimated by their
area under the curves following i.v. and i.p. administration.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

Plasma pharmacokinetic variables compared well with those
described for other pyrazole and isoxazole HSP90 inhibitors
(31, 34), with similar fast clearances following both i.p. and i.v.
administration to athymic mice bearing WM266.4 human melanomas (Fig. 4A–D). However, as predicted from its decreased metabolism and high cellular uptake, NVP-AUY922 showed enhanced
tissue distribution with ratios of z4.0 in WM266.4 tumors, liver,
and spleen compared with plasma following i.v. administration.
Importantly, tumor clearance was significantly lower than that of
normal tissues, with a longer terminal half-life of 14.7 to 15.5 h.
This resulted in tumor NVP-AUY922 levels at least 100  GI50
concentrations over 24 h following both i.v. and i.p. administration.
Similar pharmacokinetic profiles were observed in other human
tumor xenografts as indicated below.
NVP-AUY922 inhibits HSP90 and exhibits potent antitumor
efficacy in human tumor xenografts. Following five daily i.p.
doses of 50 mg/kg NVP-AUY922 to athymic mice bearing BRAF
mutant WM266.4 melanoma xenografts, liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry analysis indicated NVP-AUY922 concentrations of 6.8 to 7.7 Amol/L in tumors over 24 h (Supplementary
Table S3). As quantified by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay, ERBB2 levels were reduced to a nadir of 7.3% of controls
at 6 h, remaining below 35% over 24 h. Phospho-ERK1/2 levels
were 65% to 83%, phospho-AKT levels were 13% to 51%, AKT levels
were 57% to 65%, and HIF-1a levels were 60% to 85%. HSP72
expression was increased to 247% to 281% of controls over the
24-h period.
The therapeutic effect of NVP-AUY922 was determined against
established WM266.4 melanoma xenografts. Daily doses of
75 mg/kg caused f10% body weight loss; thus, doses were reduced to 50 mg/kg/d after eight doses and body weights rapidly
recovered. NVP-AUY922 significantly inhibited tumor growth rate,
reducing the mean weights of tumors on day 11 from 252 F 19 mg
in controls to 78 F 6 mg (Fig. 5A). Tumor samples on day 11
(24 h after the final dose) showed the HSP90 inhibition signature of
depleted ERBB2 and CDK4, with induced HSP72 (Fig. 5B).
We next tested 50 mg/kg NVP-AUY922 given i.p. or i.v. daily
against established WM266.4 melanoma xenografts. The treatment
regimens were well tolerated with either no (i.p.) or <5% (i.v.)
differences in mean body weights compared with controls. Tumor
weights after 9 days of treatment were reduced by 55% in the i.v.
group (P = 0.000085) and by 46% in the i.p. group (P = 0.00067)
compared with controls. Biomarker changes confirmed HSP90
inhibition in tumor as in the previous study. Both routes of administration gave comparable levels of NVP-AUY922 in the tumors
(similar to those reported above in the single dose studies),
consistent with the comparable efficacy and pharmacodynamic
changes observed. In three additional studies, mice with established WM266.4 tumors were treated with different schedules of
NVP-AUY922, and in all cases, significant growth delays were observed, with some recovery of growth rate toward the end of dosing
(Supplementary Table S5).
We also tested the ability of NVP-AUY922 to inhibit established
disseminated melanoma. Therapy commenced 7 days after i.v.
injection of WM266.4 melanoma cells and continued for 32 days
(50 mg/kg five times weekly for 18 days, three times weekly for a
further 14 days). Histologic examination of lungs indicated that
both the number and size of lung metastases were decreased by
NVP-AUY922 treatment (Fig. 5C). The mean number of metastases
was reduced from 61 F 13 to 17 F 3 (72% inhibition; P = 0.0037)
and the total area occupied by the metastases decreased from

as shown in Fig. 5D.
We then determined the efficacy of NVP-AUY922 in established
PTEN-null U87MG human glioblastoma xenografts. Again, highly
significant growth inhibition was obtained; indeed, regressions
were observed because mean tumor volumes on day 18 were
decreased to 58% of day 0 values (Fig. 6A). HSP90 inhibition was
confirmed by Western blot with significant depletion of ERBB2,
AKT, phospho-ERK1/2, HIF-1a, and survivin together with
increased HSP72 (data not shown). We also showed clear depletion
of phospho-AKT (Ser473) and phospho-S6 (Ser240/244) in histologic
sections, consistent with inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (Fig. 6B). Figure 6C shows that levels of
HIF-1a and AKT were decreased to 39% and 27% of controls,
respectively, and HSP72 levels increased by f800% as measured
by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Finally, microvessel density was significantly reduced in NVP-AUY922–treated tumors, suggesting an antiangiogenic effect (Fig. 6D).
A parallel pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of five daily
doses (50 mg/kg i.p., comparable with that described above
for WM266.4) was performed in U87MG xenografts. Mean tumor
NVP-AUY922 concentrations were 3.8 to 6.7 Amol/L from 6 to

24 h following the last dose (Supplementary Table S4). PhosphoAKT expression was reduced to 19% to 56%, AKT to 74% to 80%,
and HIF-1a to 32% to 48% of controls over 6 to 24 h. PhosphoERK1/2 levels were apparently not decreased in this tumor but
HSP72 expression was increased to 228% to 530% of controls (data
not shown).
The therapeutic efficacy of NVP-AUY922 was explored in further
human tumor xenografts of varying histogenic origins and with
differing molecular abnormalities. Strong inhibitory effects were
obtained in the PTEN and PIK3CA mutant A2780 ovarian
carcinoma [treated/control (T/C) of 10.5% after 8 daily treatments
with 50 mg/kg i.p.; Supplementary Fig. S5A] and the ERBB2+ ERa+
BT474 breast carcinoma (T/C of 21% after 24 daily treatments;
Supplementary Fig. S5B). In the latter case, regressions were observed in 5 of 12 tumors. Body weight loss was <5% and clear biomarker changes consistent with HSP90 inhibition were obtained in
both studies (Supplementary Fig. S5C and D). In BT474, complete
loss of ERBB2 and substantial depletion of ERa were shown, in
addition to reductions in CDK4 and phospho-ERK1/2.
Finally, we explored the ability of NVP-AUY922 (50 mg/kg
daily i.p.) to inhibit growth and spontaneous metastasis in an
established orthotopic and metastatic PTEN-null human prostate

carcinoma xenograft model (PC3LN3). Primary tumor growth was
reduced (Supplementary Fig. S6A), as was the incidence and mass
of local lymph node metastases (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Fiftythree percent of control animals developed distant lymph node
metastases, but none was detected in the NVP-AUY922–treated
animals. Western blots showed induction of HSP72, strong
depletion of ERBB2, and weak but detectable depletion of CDK4
(Supplementary Fig. S6C). The antitumor activity of NVP-AUY922
in all human tumor xenograft models tested is summarized in
Supplementary Table S5.

Discussion
NVP-AUY922 was discovered in a multiparameter lead optimization program (35) based on a high-throughput screening hit (30).

Initial activities focused on improving potency against the HSP90
target using X-ray crystallography and structure-based drug design,
resulting in the resorcinol pyrazole amide VER-49009 (31, 33).
Replacement of the pyrazole with isoxazole led to VER-50589 with
further increments in target affinity and enhanced cellular uptake
and antiproliferative activity with acceptable pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic properties, leading to antitumor activity in
HCT116 xenografts (34). Further lead optimization, focussing on
maintaining or increasing potency while improving physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic behavior,
resulted in NVP-AUY922 (35).
To our knowledge, NVP-AUY922 exhibits the highest affinity of
any synthetic small-molecule inhibitor yet reported for the NH2terminal nucleotide-binding site of human HSP90, with a K d of
1.7 F 0.5 nmol/L. The binding potency is explained by the bonding

Figure 5. NVP-AUY922 shows therapeutic activity against established BRAF mutant WM266.4 human melanoma xenografts and lung metastases. Xenografts of the
BRAFV600D mutant WM266.4 human melanoma were established s.c. bilaterally in the flanks of female NCr athymic mice as described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods. Groups of animals were randomized to vehicle or drug treatment when the mean tumor diameter was 5 to 6 mm (day 8 after tumor cell implantation).
Animals initially received 75 mg/kg NVP-AUY922 (or an equivalent volume of vehicle) i.p. daily for eight doses, and then the dose was reduced to 50 mg/kg until day 11
when samples were obtained for analyses (24 h following the final dose). Results are expressed as % of tumor volumes at the commencement of therapy. In a second
study, WM266.4 cells were injected i.v. to model lung metastases. Therapy with NVP-AUY922 was initiated 7 d later and continued five times weekly for 18 d
and then three times weekly for a further 14 d. Lungs were excised, weighed, and sectioned, and lung metastases were scored by image analysis of three random

interactions revealed by the X-ray cocrystal structure, together with
the entropy and enthalpy factors. NVP-AUY922 also exhibited a
degree of selectivity against the HSP90 target over the highly
homologous HSP90 family members GRP94 and TRAP-1. This is
distinct from 17-AAG, which exhibits moderate selectivity over
GRP94 but is highly selective against TRAP-1. In addition, NVPAUY922 at 10 Amol/L showed no significant inhibition of the
related GHKL family member human topoisomerase II, was
inactive against human HSP72, and exhibited little or no inhibition
of a large panel of additional kinases, other enzymes, and receptors.
The human tumor cells sensitive to NVP-AUY922 represent
diverse tissue origins and were selected to exhibit a range of key
molecular abnormalities, including PTEN loss (e.g., PC3 and
U87MG) and expression of activated oncogenes such as the ERBB
family (e.g., BT474, SKBR3, T47D, and DU145), mutant KRAS
(HCT116), mutant PIK3CA (HCT116, A2780, and BT474), mutant
BRAF (WM266.4, SKMEL28, BE, and HT29), and mutant TP53
(SKMEL2 and SKMEL28). The activity seen across the tumor cell
line panel (Supplementary Table S2) suggests that NVP-AUY922
could have wide therapeutic applicability. Its cellular potency is
significantly enhanced compared with earlier isoxazole and pyra-

zole resorcinols developed in this research program. Mean GI50
values in comparable tumor cell panels are as follows: NVPAUY922, 10.8 nmol/L versus 5,300 nmol/L for CCT018159, 685
nmol/L for VER-49009, and 78 nmol/L for VER-50589, representing
an f5,000-fold improvement from the original hit and a 6.6-fold
enhancement compared with the recently reported isoxazole
VER-50589 (34). Importantly, NVP-AUY922 activity is independent
of NQO1/DT-diaphorase metabolism, is equally effective in cells
with acquired resistance to oxaliplatin or doxorubicin, and retains
activity under hypoxic conditions.
In human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells and others, exposure to
NVP-AUY922 resulted in G1 and G2-M arrest. However, this is cell
line and tumor type dependent, as seen with other HSP90 inhibitors (31, 40), because G1 arrest only was observed in SKMEL5
melanoma cells and BT474 breast cancer cells. There was clear
evidence of concentration- and time-dependent biomarker modulation and induction of HSP72 expression, the accepted molecular
signature of HSP90 inhibition (14, 19). At 5  GI50 concentrations,
client protein depletion was usually evident by 8 h, although CDK4
levels fell later and recovered sooner or in some cells were relatively
unaffected. Inhibition of signaling (as evidenced by the loss of

phosphorylated ERBB2 and AKT in high ERBB2-expressing breast
carcinoma cells) could often be detected before degradation of
client protein. Previous reports have shown that depletion of key
client proteins (such as ERBB2 and AKT) is closely correlated with
antiproliferative effects of benzoquinone ansamycin HSP90 inhibitors and that the pharmacodynamic changes are generally seen at
4 to 5  GI50 concentrations (14, 19). Our findings with NVPAUY922, a member of a different chemical class of HSP90 inhibitor,
are consistent with these observations.
Cell fate following HSP90 inhibition varied between cell lines and
involved caspase-dependent or caspase-independent cell death or
cytostasis. It is likely that the expression of factors downstream of
loss of client protein signaling following HSP90 inhibition is critical
for subsequent cell fate. Identification of factors that confer cell
survival through induction of cell stasis rather than death may help
to determine sensitive patient populations. The fact that inhibition
of other cellular functions (such as chemomigration) occurs at
concentrations below those required for cytostasis attests to their
particular reliance on HSP90 chaperones (22).
In addition to the enhanced cellular potency of NVP-AUY922,
further advantages were obtained from decreased microsomal
metabolism, leading to reduced glucuronide metabolite in plasma
compared with previously described pyrazoles and isoxazoles

(32, 34). This translated into a significant improvement in tumor
distribution. Indeed, NVP-AUY922 was selected from a set of similar
compounds based on sustained high tumor levels following cassette
dosing in tumor-bearing mice (35). Following i.v. and i.p. administration of 50 mg/kg NVP-AUY922, tumor levels were f100  GI50
and sustained for at least 24 h. Given the cellular accumulation
observed with NVP-AUY922, it is likely that high concentrations are
required in tumors for robust target inhibition and therapeutic
efficacy. HSP90 is abundant in tumor cells. The concentration of
820 to 1,100 nmol NVP-AUY922/million cells measured in HCT116
following treatment with 5  GI50 concentrations would correspond
to f5 Amol/L in tumor tissue based on protein measurements.
These levels are within the concentration range observed following
single and multiple dosing in animals (Fig. 4). Similar high levels
were observed in human tumor xenograft models following 17-AAG
treatment (19) and would be predicted to occur in cancers of
treated patients based on plasma pharmacokinetics (14).
NVP-AUY922 was well tolerated in mice at 50 mg/kg/d and showed
excellent target inhibition evidenced by depletion of multiple client
proteins and induction of HSP72, leading to therapeutic efficacy in a
wide variety of human tumor xenografts with different molecular
pathologies. The results compare favorably with those for VER50589 (34) and with other HSP90 inhibitors (29, 41). Significant

Characterization of Novel HSP90 Inhibitor NVP-AUY922

tumor growth inhibition (T/C, 50%) was previously shown with
NVP-AUY922 in HCT116 xenografts (35), and here, we extended
these observations to established melanoma, glioblastoma, and
breast, ovarian, and prostate carcinomas. In some tumors (e.g.,
BT474 breast cancer and U87MG glioblastoma), regressions were
obtained. In all cases, robust therapeutic responses correlated with
clear biomarker modulation and with compound levels in tumors
well above the GI50 for sustained periods.
In addition to effects on s.c. human tumor xenografts, it is
notable that mutant BRAF-expressing melanoma lung metastases
were inhibited by NVP-AUY922 because f70% of melanomas
harbor such activating mutations (42) and there are no effective
treatments for disseminated disease. Interestingly, in a phase I trial
of 17-AAG, sustained responses were obtained in two melanoma
patients with good biomarker responses (14). High levels of HSP90
have been reported in human melanomas compared with benign
nevi, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of cells
isolated from melanoma metastases indicated cell surface expression of HSP90 (43), reflecting experimental studies suggesting that
a proportion of HSP90 is extracellular and associated with tumor
cell invasion (21). Thus, malignant melanoma is an exciting target
for NVP-AUY922 and other HSP90 inhibitors.
ERa and ERBB2 HSP90 client proteins were depleted in BT474
human breast cancer cells and tumor xenografts by NVP-AUY922,
consistent with the therapeutic response seen in this model. Hence,
there is optimism that patients with either hormone-responsive or
hormone-nonresponsive breast carcinomas may obtain therapeutic
benefit from HSP90 inhibitors. HSP90 is overexpressed in human
breast cancer and expression correlates with survival (9). Of great
interest is the recent report of responses to 17-AAG plus trastuzumab in patients with trastuzumab-refractory breast cancers
(16). In addition, heregulin h1 (an ERBB ligand) induces HSP90,
contributing to protection from apoptosis/anoikis (44). Thus, HSP90
inhibition should reverse this survival advantage and indeed 17-AAG
sensitizes SKBR3 and BT474 breast carcinoma cells to proapoptotic
stimulators such as paclitaxel (45). Similar results were obtained in
ovarian carcinoma cells with high levels of activated AKT (46).
Prostate cancers, which may express androgen receptors or
dependency on the PI3K pathway by virtue of PTEN deletion, may
also respond well to HSP90 inhibitors. 17-AAG was reported to slow
the growth of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent
human prostate cancer xenografts at s.c. sites (47). Here, we show
for the first time that a HSP90 inhibitor can limit the growth of
established orthotopic PTEN-null, hormone-independent prostate
carcinoma xenografts and can also block the development of spontaneous lymphatic metastases. Thus, hormone-independent prostate
cancer is another example in which acceptable treatment options
are limited and where NVP-AUY922 may have therapeutic potential.
HIF-1a is a HSP90 client protein in renal cell carcinoma cells
where its high expression is due to loss of the von Hippel Lindau
gene product (48). HIF-1a is also regulated by hypoxia, oncogenes,
or activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as ERBB2, EGFR, and

insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (49). Here, we show that NVPAUY922 is equally active under hypoxic conditions and depletes
HIF-1a in U87MG human glioblastoma tumor xenografts. Because
HIF-1a is implicated in tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and drug
resistance (49), this extends the potential of HSP90 inhibitors to
target these key aspects of tumor progression. Indeed, we provide
evidence that NVP-AUY922 potently inhibits tumor cell invasion,
endothelial cell functions associated with angiogenesis in vitro
(proliferation, motility, matrix invasion, and tubular differentiation), and tumor vascularization in vivo, as previously shown for
17-AAG and 17-DMAG (23, 24).
Geldanamycin and 17-AAG were reported to inhibit invasion of
tumor cells in vitro (21, 22); however, these findings were not
extended to in vivo therapy studies of invasion or metastasis. The
present article provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that a
HSP90 inhibitor can inhibit both hematogenous and spontaneous
lymphatic metastases in preclinical xenograft models. 17-AAG was
shown to enhance bone metastasis in a breast carcinoma xenograft
model (50). The inhibition of lung and lymphatic metastasis
reported here suggests that these effects may be context and/or
chemical class dependent.
Although 17-AAG has shown early promise as a first-in-class,
proof-of-concept HSP90 inhibitor and is in phase II clinical trial, it
has formulation issues and is associated with significant toxicity,
such as liver dysfunction, optical neuritis, dyspnea, fatigue, and
gastrointestinal side effects (14, 15). It is unclear which toxicities
are associated specifically with HSP90 inhibitors (on-target effects)
and which are related to specific chemical scaffolds [e.g., the
benzoquinone moiety (off-target effects)]. There is therefore a need
to discover and develop alternative inhibitors. NVP-AUY922 was
derived from our resorcinylic pyrazole/isoxazole amide series
(31, 33, 34) and is, to our knowledge, the most potent synthetic
small-molecule inhibitor yet reported. In addition, optimization of
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic properties led to robust therapeutic responses in a wide variety of human tumor xenografts
(including orthotopic and metastatic models) tightly linked to high
intratumoral concentrations of compound and clear pharmacodynamic responses. Taken together, these data support the selection
of NVP-AUY922 as an exciting candidate for clinical evaluation.
NVP-AUY922 has entered phase I clinical trials.
