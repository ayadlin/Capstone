BACKGROUND: Inhibiting src kinases (non-receptor tyrosine kinase signaling intermediates) reduces melanoma cell
proliferation and invasion. Dasatinib inhibits c-kit, PDGFbR, and EPHA2 and src kinases c-src, c-Yes, Lck, and Fyn. A
phase 2 trial of dasatinib in melanoma was conducted to assess response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS),
and toxicity. METHODS: Adults with stage 3/4 chemotherapy-naı̈ve unresectable melanoma were eligible. Dasatinib
was initially administered at 100 mg twice daily continuously to 17 patients. Due to toxicity, the starting dosage was
decreased to 70 mg twice daily. Tumor assessments occurred every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled, 36 of whom were evaluable for activity and toxicity. Five, 4, and 3 patients had acral-lentiginous, ocular, or mucosal primaries, respectively. Two patients had confirmed partial responses lasting 64 and 24 weeks (RR 5%). Three
patients had minor responses lasting 136, 64, and 28 weeks, and 1 patient who was responding discontinued due to
noncompliance. The median PFS was 8 weeks; the 6-month PFS rate was 13%. One patient with an exon-13 c-kit
mutation had a partial response, whereas disease in another patient with an exon-11 c-kit mutation progressed. Common toxicities were fatigue, dyspnea, and pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS: Daily dasatinib has minimal activity in
unselected melanoma patients, excluding those with c-kit mutations. The study did not meet the prespecified endpoints of 30% response rate or 6-month PFS. Dasatinib was poorly tolerated overall, often requiring dose reduction
or interruption. Because activity was observed in a small subset without c-kit mutations, identifying predictive biomarkers is important for future development of dasatinib in melanoma alone or in combination trials. Cancer

KEYWORDS: src kinases, dasatinib, melanoma.

Systemic therapy options for metastatic melanoma are limited. Immune modulation, such as high-dose interleukin2, anti-CTLA-4, and adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T lymphocytes can induce durable responses in 5%-20% of
patients, but not all patients are candidates for these therapies.1,2 Cytotoxic chemotherapy induces responses in approximately 10%-15%, but responses are rarely durable, and there is no proven impact on overall survival. Recently, an inhibitor of mutated BRAF was shown to cause shrinkage of tumors harboring BRAFV600E mutations.3,4 Only 40%-50% of
melanomas have BRAF mutations, and although responses to the inhibitor were impressive, most patients develop resistance over time. Similar results have been published for c-kit inhibitors in melanoma patients whose tumors harbor activating c-kit mutations,5 but these mutations are relatively rare.6 Therefore, for the vast majority of melanoma patients,
additional, well-tolerated, molecular-targeted therapies are needed.
Dasatinib is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including src family kinases (c-src,
yes, lck, and fyn), bcr-abl, c-kit, PDGFb receptor, and EPHA2.7 The IC50 for enzyme inhibition for these kinases is in the
low nanomolar range (<1 nM for c-src, yes, and fyn and >20 nM for PDGFbR).8 Dasatinib was approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.9,10 It was generally well tolerated in earlier studies. Based on toxicities in the phase 1 trial for solid tumors, a starting dosage of 70-120 mg
twice daily was recommended for phase 2 studies.11,12 Common toxicities in previous studies include anemia, diarrhea,
nausea and vomiting, hemorrhage, fatigue, dyspnea, anorexia, dehydration, fluid retention, pleural and pericardial effusion, a moderate increase in QTcF, elevated creatinine level, and depression.12

Dasatinib Activity in Melanoma/Kluger et al

Several receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream
intermediates inhibited by dasatinib have been shown to
play a role in melanoma cell growth and metastasis. Aberrant expression of basic fibroblast growth factor is one of
the common early events in progression of melanocytes to
melanoma and is associated with melanoma growth and
survival.13 In melanoma cells, suppression of fibroblast
growth factor receptor 1 is associated with decreased src
kinase activity, resulting in decreased melanoma proliferation and tumorigenesis.14 C-src activation results in proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and motility of cancer
cells, and in many malignancies is active in advanced stage
disease.15 src-activated Stat3 signaling is necessary for
growth and survival of melanoma cells.16 Stat5 activation
in melanoma cells is also mediated through src kinases,
and is important for cell survival.17 Several investigators
reported increased src kinase activity in melanoma cells.18
In addition to src, other dasatinib targets have been associated with melanoma proliferation or survival. Activation
of PDGFbR in B16 melanoma cells promotes angiogenesis, tumor growth, and inhibition of apoptosis.19 The Eph
receptor family is up-regulated in melanoma and contributes to the malignant process.20
The need for improved systemic therapies for metastatic melanoma coupled with preclinical evidence that src
kinases are important intracellular signaling intermediates
in melanoma cells provided the rationale for initiating a
phase 2 single agent trial of dasatinib in unresectable stage
3 and 4 melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program of the National Cancer Institute and Institutional Review Boards at Yale University and the
University of Minnesota.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed, unresectable stage 3/4 melanoma of cutaneous, mucosal, or ocular
origin. Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors21 and disease progression in the 6
months prior to enrollment was required. No prior chemotherapy was allowed; up to 2 prior immunotherapies or
biological therapies were acceptable. Prior radiation to
nonmeasurable sites was permissible. Patients had to be
>18 years old, be willing and able to sign informed consent, have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and have a life expectancy of 3

months. Adequate organ and bone marrow function was
required, as were the following parameters: white blood
cell count >3000/lL, platelet count >100,000/lL, hemoglobin level 9.0 g/dL, total bilirubin level 1.5 mg/
mL, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, and
creatinine level 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.
Patients with active brain metastases were excluded.
Treated brain metastases stable for 8 weeks were
allowed. Patients requiring immunosuppressant agents
(including steroids), proarrhythmic drugs, or potent
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and patients with a
QTc >480 msec were ineligible. Other exclusion criteria
included pregnancy, concurrent active malignancies, and
human immunodeficiency virus infection.

Study Design and Treatment
This single-arm phase 2 study was open at Yale University
and the University of Minnesota. Dasatinib was initially
administered at 100 mg twice daily. After enrolling 17
patients, the starting dosage was reduced to 70 mg twice
daily. Each cycle was 28 days. There were no planned
breaks between cycles. Patients continued treatment until
progressive disease or intolerable toxicity occurred. The
dose modification criteria were standard; grade 2 toxicities
required interruption of treatment until toxicity resolved
to grade 1 or lower. Grade 3 hematological toxicities
required dose reduction, whereas grade 4 toxicities
required discontinuation of the study drug. Grade 3 or 4
nonhematological toxicities similarly required cessation of
dasatinib. For the first 17 patients, the dosage levels were
as follows: dosage level-1, 100 mg in the morning , 50 mg
in the afternoon; dosage level-2, 50 mg twice daily. The
dosages were subsequently modified as follows: dosage
level-0, 70 mg twice daily; dosage level-1, 50 mg twice
daily; dosage level-2, 100 mg/d; dosage level-3, 70 mg/d.

Assessment of Toxicity and Response
The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 was used to grade adverse events. Brain
imaging was performed at baseline and every 16 weeks.
Imaging of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and—when necessary—limbs, was performed via computed tomography,
magnetic resonance imaging, and/or positron emission
tomography at baseline and every 8 weeks (2 cycles).
Response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors .21

c-kit Mutational Analyses
Pretreatment tumor biopsies were reviewed by a pathologist, and areas of invasive tumor were identified. DNA was
extracted, and sequencing of exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 of the
c-kit gene was conducted using standard methods.22
Statistical Methods
Other agents used for metastatic melanoma have response
rates of <20%. In a recent randomized trial of 777
patients with untreated metastatic disease, approximately
30% had progression-free survival (PFS) >120 days and
approximately 20% had PFS >180 days. The median
PFS ranged from 1.6 to 2.4 months.23 For agents such as
dasatinib, prolonged stable disease may be an indication
of activity. For this study, a response rate (RR) or 6month PFS rate consistent with 30% was considered
worthy of further study. For this phase 2 trial, a Simon’s
optimum 2-stage design was used.24 The predetermined
criterion for moving to the second stage was 3 patients of
the first 18 achieving either 6-month PFS or partial or
complete response. The purpose was to differentiate RR
10% from RR 30% and to differentiate 6-month PFS
10% from PFS 30% (corresponding to a median PFS
of 3.5 vs 1.8 months). If at least 7 responses (20%) or at
least 7 instances of 6-month PFS were observed among
the evaluable patients, this agent would be considered

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Enrollment demographics are shown in Table 1. Thirtynine patients were enrolled at Yale University and University of Minnesota between February 2007 and June 2009,
of whom 36 were evaluable for response and toxicity. The
remaining 3 patients were excluded from toxicity assessments for early withdrawal (<1 cycle) due to noncompliance (withdrawal from the study due to voluntary
discontinuation of therapy without protocol-specified
toxicities or disease progression). These patients withdrew
for personal and social reasons. All drug activity analyses
are based on the 39 enrolled patients. The mean age was
64 years; 67% of the patients were men; 44% and 56%
had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 and 1, respectively; and 28%, 39%, and
33% had M1a, M1b, and M1c disease, respectively. Five,
4, and 3 patients had acral-lentiginous, ocular, or mucosal
primaries, respectively.
Dose Delivery
Toxicity assessments and adverse events (AEs) were based
on the 36 evaluable patients. The first 17 patients began at
100 mg twice daily. Twelve (71%) patients had the drug
held for toxicity. The most common AEs requiring cessation of treatment were dyspnea (n ¼ 7, 41%), pleural
effusion (n ¼ 6, 35%), fatigue (n ¼ 11, 65%), and diarrhea (n ¼ 2, 12%). The median time on the 100 mg twice
daily dosage was 4 weeks.
Nineteen patients were treated at a starting dosage
of 70 mg twice daily. Dasatinib was held and/or dosereduced due to toxicity in 9 (47%) patients. AEs resulting
in holding treatment were similar to the 100 mg twice
daily dosage and included dyspnea (n ¼ 5, 26%), pleural
effusion (n ¼ 3,16%), fatigue (n ¼ 6, 32%) and anorexia
(n ¼ 2, 11%). The median time on the 70 mg twice daily
dosage was 7.5 weeks.
Drug-Related AEs
AEs are summarized in Table 2. The most common AEs
were fatigue (n ¼ 35, 97%), dyspnea (n ¼ 31, 86%),

pleural effusion (n ¼ 17, 47%), nausea (n ¼ 29, 81%),
and anorexia (n ¼ 26, 72%). Most AEs were grade 1 or 2.
The most common grade 3 or 4 events were fatigue, dyspnea, and pleural effusion. Pleural effusions were commonly successfully managed with a short course of
prednisone and/or furosemide.
There were no grade 3 or 4 laboratory AEs. Grade 12 events included hypocalcemia (12 patients, 45%) and
elevations in aminotransferase levels (n ¼ 9, 27%), creatinine level (n ¼ 8, 23%), and alkaline phosphatase level (n
¼ 3, 8%). Hematological toxicities included neutropenia
(n ¼ 3, 8%), thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 4, 11%), and anemia (n ¼ 12, 34%). With the exception of anemia-related
fatigue, laboratory abnormalities were not associated with
symptoms and resolved with cessation of therapy.

1.537-18.145). Tumor regression that did not meet partial response criteria was seen in 3 patients (8%), lasting
136, 64, and 28 weeks. The patient with a minor response
lasting 64 weeks had a 28% reduction in tumor burden.
One patient with a 27% reduction in tumor burden withdrew from the study after completing the fourth cycle.
Regression of liver lesions was observed after 2 cycles in 1
patient (not listed in Table 3), but the disease progressed
after the fourth cycle. Overall, sites of response included
subcutaneous tissues, lymph nodes, lung, liver, and skin.
PFS and overall survival curves are shown in Figure
1. The median PFS was 8 weeks (range, 3-136 weeks); the
median overall survival was 55 weeks (range, 7-159
weeks). As of May 2010, 6 (16%) patients remained alive,
and 3 (8%) patients were lost to follow-up.

Activity
Table 3 lists all patients demonstrating tumor regression
for >16 weeks, their primary site of disease, sites of metastatic disease, and PFS. Of the 36 patients evaluable for
activity, 2 had a confirmed partial response, lasting 64
and 24 weeks, for a RR of 5% (95% confidence interval,

c-kit Expression and Mutations
Dasatinib is a known potent inhibitor of c-kit, and by the
time this study was activated, reports were published documenting excellent clinical responses in melanoma
patients whose tumors had activating c-kit mutations
treated with c-kit inhibitors.5,25 Therefore, in patients
demonstrating a tumor response of any kind to dasatinib,
and in selected other patients in whom c-kit overexpression and/or mutation was expected based on prior literature reports, we determined c-kit mutation and/or
expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in pretreatment tumor samples. Only one responder, a patient with
a primary subungual melanoma, had a K642E substitution mutation in exon 13 of c-kit. The other patients demonstrating some tumor reduction all had wild-type c-kit
(Table 3).
Tissue was available on 5 of 8 other patients with
primary acral-lentiginous or mucosal melanomas. An
exon 11 deletion mutation was found in 1 patient who
did not respond to dasatinib. One patient had strong c-kit
expression by IHC (3þ on a scale of 0-3), but no mutation, and did not respond. No other responses were

(but insufficient for mutational analyses) on 3 patients
with primary ocular melanoma. All had expression by
IHC, but none responded.

DISCUSSION
Dasatinib is an inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases that
play a role in melanoma pathogenesis, including src family members, and the EPHA2, PDGFbR, and c-kit receptors. We conducted a phase 2 clinical trial of dasatinib in
39 unselected patients with advanced melanoma.
One of the primary endpoints was to assess toxicity.
The starting dose was based on the maximum tolerated
dose in the phase 1 solid tumor trial. Toxicity was intolerable, and a surprisingly high rate of toxicity was seen at
lower doses as well. Although the majority of AEs were
grade 1/2, and all resolved with holding therapy, the
chronicity of the toxicities resulted in impaired quality of
life and frequent cessation of therapy. Dyspnea and fatigue secondary to pleural effusions were fairly easily managed with temporary treatment cessation and a short
course of prednisone, with or without furosemide. The
increased frequency and severity of AEs in our study compared with the phase 1 study likely reflects the improved
life expectancy of the patients in this phase 2 trial and the
longer resultant duration of treatment.
The objective RR from dasatinib was 5%. Evidence
of tumor regression, confirmed after 4 cycles of therapy,
was observed in 5 other patients, including 2 patients with
PFS exceeding 1 year. The median PFS was only 8 weeks.
Preclinical studies published after initiation of this trial

2206

showed variable inhibition of melanoma cell growth by
dasatinib in vitro. Eustace et al26 reported an IC50 in the
nanomolar range for only 1 of 5 cell lines, Homsi et al27
showed variable sensitivity in 3 cell lines, Buettner et al28
showed little to no effect on viability, and Woodman
et al25 demonstrated activity in c-kit mutant cell lines. In
our own studies, 2 of 8 cell lines were growth-inhibited by
concentrations <300 nM, whereas the other 6 were significantly more resistant (unpublished data). Peak serum
concentrations reached just over 0.2 lM in patients on
the highest dose level in the phase 1 solid tumor trial (120
mg), and the elimination half-life was approximately 4
hours.8,12 Thus, although serum drug concentrations
might not accurately reflect intracellular levels, the pharmacokinetic data raise concerns that levels of drug necessary for cell growth inhibition may not be achievable in
most patients. Of note, in the phase 1 studies, clinically
tolerable doses were sufficient to inhibit c-src in posttreatment tumor biopsy specimens. However, inhibition of
src-kinases may not be sufficient to mediate a measurable
antitumor effect in most patients. The phase 2 clinical
study was not designed to detect other potentially meaningful biological effects of src inhibition, such as reduction
in motility or invasion.28
After this trial was written, reports of c-kit mutations
in up to 30% of acral-lentiginous melanomas and 39% of
mucosal melanomas were published.29 Over the past 4
years, several investigators have reported dramatic tumor
regression in melanoma patients whose tumors had c-kit
mutations, as seen in gastrointestinal stromal tumor
patients . In contrast, c-kit mutations were generally not
found in cutaneous melanomas arising in intermittently

sun-exposed skin or in ocular melanomas, although the
latter often demonstrated c-kit overexpression by
IHC.30,31 Two of our 9 patients with primary acral-lentiginous or mucosal primaries had documented c-kit mutations. Both had subungual primaries, and 1 achieved a
partial response to dasatinib. No confirmed responses
were observed in c-kit overexpressing tumors lacking a ckit mutation, although we did not assess gene amplification status. Our data are consistent with other reports.5,25
Upon disease progression, the responding patient with a
tumor c-kit mutation developed an excellent response to
sorafenib, another c-kit inhibitor, in combination with
temozolomide. The systemic response was durable, but
she ultimately developed uncontrollable brain metastases.
This limited single-patient experience suggests that different c-kit mutations may respond variably to c-kit inhibitors, that progression on one c-kit inhibitor does not
preclude response to another, and lack of drug CNS penetration and consequent CNS disease progression may be a
problem.
Other than the patient with a subungal melanoma
and a c-kit mutation, other patients who had tumor
reduction had tumors that were wild-type for c-kit, indicating that other pathways and molecules targeted by
dasatinib might be driving proliferation in these tumors.
In our in vitro studies, we attempted to identify predictors
of sensitivity to dasatinib, and found that high caveolin-1
levels are associated with in vitro growth inhibition
(unpublished data). Although the number of patients in
whom activity was seen in this trial is small, there might
be an association between pretreatment caveolin-1 tumor
levels and tumor reduction. This is consistent with findings in other diseases,32,33 and requires validation in additional trials of dasatinib for melanoma. The biological
relationship between dasatinib target inhibition, caveolin1 expression, and the mechanism of growth inhibition
remains unclear.
Based on the study design, an overall response rate
20% or 6-month PFS 20%, single-agent dasatinib
would have been considered worthy of further study in
this disease. This is a relatively stringent requirement for a
multitarget kinase inhibitor without pre-selection of
patients based on tumor biology. Our results do suggest
that dasatinib has some activity in melanoma, and further
evaluation of patient subsets such as caveolin-1 overexpressors and c-kit-mutated tumors are ongoing in the preclinical and clinical setting, respectively. Further
evaluation of dasatinib in carefully selected melanoma
patients might be warranted.

Cancer

As with other antineoplastic agents, increased activity might be seen with addition of drugs that work by alternative mechanisms. Combinations with other small
molecule inhibitors might result in severe toxicities, as has
been the experience when combining small molecule
inhibitors in other diseases.34 Addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy with limited overlapping toxicities might be better tolerated. Our recent in vitro studies, and those of
others, suggest that addition of cisplatin or dacarbazine
might enhance dasatinib activity.27 A trial of a chemotherapy-dasatinib combination has been initiated at another
center. It may be important to identify those patients that
have the best chance for responding to the combination,
for example, by preselecting for high caveolin-1 expression in tumor, and for factors permissive of response to
the chemotherapy, such as low O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase expression and an intact DNA mismatch repair pathway.
In conclusion, single-agent dasatinib has minimal
activity in unselected melanoma patients, and at doses
used in this trial, produces poorly tolerated toxicities in
most patients. Tumor regression was noted in approximately 14% of patients without tumor c-kit mutations
and one of two with c-kit mutations. This level of activity
suggests that biomarker-based patient preselection may
identify a subset of patients who could potentially benefit
from dasatinib as a single agent or in combination with
other agents, and predictors of sensitivity/response need
to be studied further. Because of the AEs, future combination studies should be based on biological activity achievable at lower serum concentrations (perhaps sufficient to
inhibit src) and molecularly defined patient subsets.
