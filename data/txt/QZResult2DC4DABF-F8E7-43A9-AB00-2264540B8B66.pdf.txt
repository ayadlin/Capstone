ABSTRACT
Platinum based drugs are the cornerstone of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer,
however the development of chemoresistance hinders its success. IL-8 is involved
in regulating several pro-survival pathways in cancer. We studied the expression of
IL-8 and IL-8 receptors in platinum sensitive and resistant cell lines. Using qRT-PCR
and immunohistochemistry, both platinum sensitive (PEA1, PEO14) and resistant
(PEA2, PEO23) show increased expression of IL-8 and IL-8 receptors. IL-8RA
shows nuclear and cytoplasmic expression, whilst IL-8RB is present solely in the
cytoplasm. Knockdown of IL-8 increased sensitivity to cisplatin in platinum sensitive
and reversed platinum resistance in resistant cell lines, decreased the expression
of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and decreased inhibitory phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic
Bad. IL-8 receptor antagonist treatment also enhanced platinum sensitivity. Nuclear
localisation of ­IL-8RA was only detected in platinum resistant tumours. Inhibition
of IL-8 signalling can enhance response in platinum sensitive and resistant disease.
Nuclear IL-8RA may have potential as a biomarker of resistant disease.

and may also be involved in the acquisition of drug
resistance via the cytokine and chemokine signalling
pathways [8].
Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory
chemokine that is principally a chemoattractant and
activator of neutrophils during an immune response
[9]. It also has cell growth, angiogenic and motogenic
effects in different types of malignancies including
melanoma, ovarian, prostate, and colon carcinoma
[10, 11]. The levels of IL-8 are elevated in ovarian cyst
fluid, ascites, serum, and tumour tissue from patients with
ovarian cancer [12]. Overexpression of IL-8 in ovarian
cancer cells increases anchorage-independent growth,
proliferation, angiogenic potential, adhesion and invasion.
These effects are decreased on depletion of endogenous
IL-8 expression by transfecting IL-8-overexpressing

INTRODUCTION
The principal treatment strategy for most
cases of ovarian carcinoma is primary cytoreductive
surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, usually
using cisplatin or carboplatin along with a taxane
(e.g paclitaxel). Approximately 75% of patients who
are initially responsive to chemotherapy can develop
platinum resistance [1], with a poor outcome for
patients that is both due to the silent progressive nature
of ovarian cancer and the development of resistance
to chemotherapy [2–4]. Among the causes of acquired
drug resistance in ovarian cancer are secretion of
molecules that confer resistance [5] and limitation of
factors required for cancer cell death [6]. The immune
system is implicated in ovarian cancer progression [7]

RESULTS

SKOV-3 cells with plasmid encoding for antisense
IL-8 [13]. Studies have shown that high expression of
IL-8 in ovarian cancer patients is significantly correlated
with poor prognosis [14, 15], with advanced tumour stage
and high tumour grade [16].
Experimental studies in prostate carcinoma
highlighted
that
IL-8
expression
confers
chemoresistance [17]. Links between resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents and IL-8 in ovarian carcinoma
have been previously demonstrated. A paclitaxel-resistant
ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV-3TR, overexpressed
a set of genes which included IL-8, suggesting that the
development of paclitaxel resistance is accompanied
by multiple changes in gene expression including
stable alterations in selective chemokine and cytokine
expression [18]. Also previous studies have shown that
paclitaxel can induce IL-8 gene expression [19, 20].
The aim of this study was to explore the role of IL-8
in platinum response in ovarian carcinoma. We show the
relationship between platinum treatment and expression
of IL-8 and IL-8 receptors and the relation to platinum
resistance in ovarian high grade serous carcinoma (HGS)
both in vitro and in clinical samples.

Expression of IL-8 and IL-8 receptors in
cell lines
To investigate the in vitro expression and subcellular localisation of IL-8RA and IL-8RB protein
levels, and the effect of cisplatin treatment on receptor
expression, sensitive and resistant ovarian high-grade
serous cancer cells were subjected to cisplatin treatment
for 24 h and then studied by immunofluorescence and
confocal microscopy. The intensity of expression and
localization of receptors were also investigated under
untreated conditions. The results confirm expression of
IL-8 receptors in all cell lines tested. The level of receptor
expression is generally higher in the resistant lines.
Nuclear localisation of IL-8RA was observed on cisplatin
treatment in all cell lines (Figure 1).
Examination of the cells at multiple levels using
confocal microscopy confirms the presence of IL-8RA in
the nucleus of cells post cisplatin treatment, in contrast to
IL-8RB, which shows no nuclear localisation. A series of
optical sections confirms these findings (Figure 2).

Figure 1: Expression of IL-8RA and IL-8RB in ovarian cancer cells pre and post cisplatin treatment. Expression levels
increase on cisplatin treatment and are generally higher in resistant as compared to sensitive cell lines. Images show cytoplasmic and
nuclear expression of IL-8RA and cytoplasmic expression of IL-8RB. (Control: negative control; no incubation with primary antibody)

Effect of IL-8 pathway inhibition on cell
sensitivity to cisplatin

All cell lines show expression of IL-8 with a rapid
transcriptional induction of IL-8 following platinum
exposure, reaching a maximum expression peak of over
200 fold above baseline following 72 hours exposure,
reducing back to near basal levels at 96 hours post
platinum treatment (Figure 3). IL-8 mRNA levels increase
more rapidly in PEA1 and PEA2 than in PEO14 and
PEO23. At 48 hours post cisplatin treatment, PEA1 and
PEA2 cell lines undergo 150–200 fold induction of IL-8
levels compared to PEO14 and PEO23 which show 95 and
75 fold induction at 48 hours (Figure 3).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IL-8 was knocked down in the intra-patient paired
platinum sensitive and resistant cell lines, PEA1/PEA2
and PEO14/PEO23. Knockdown of IL-8 was confirmed
by qRT-PCR in all lines.
All cell lines showed a reduction in IL-8 expression
in siRNA treated cells of > 50% when compared to
untreated controls. Following cisplatin treatment IL-8
siRNA treated cells show enhanced apoptotic response to

platinum in PEA1 (clinically platinum sensitive, ~2 fold;
not statistically significant) and PEA2 (clinically platinum
resistant, > 2 fold; P = 0.0018) cells (Figure 4A).
We sought to further confirm that blocking IL-8
signalling influences chemoresistance, using an IL-8
receptor A/B antagonist. Blocking of IL-8 A/B receptors
re-sensitised PEA2 cells to cisplatin treatment (25 μm),
as shown by a significant increase in apoptosis (> 3-fold;
P = 0.0041) compared to the cisplatin only treated cells
(Figure 4B). This observation mirrors the results obtained

by siRNA knockdown of IL-8 compared to the nontargeting control (Figure 4A).

The relationship between IL-8 signalling,
response to platinum treatment and
pro-apoptotic proteins
Previous studies have shown that anti-apoptotic
protein levels are constitutively higher in platinum resistant
cells. To understand the mechanism of enhancement of

Figure 3: Expression of IL-8 on platinum treatment in isogenic pairs of platinum sensitive and platinum resistant cell
lines. There is a consistent trend of increased IL-8 expression up to a peak at 72 hours followed by drop to basal levels around 96 hours in
both platinum sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cells.

DISCUSSION

platinum response following IL-8 pathway inhibition,
we studied the levels of two key regulators of apoptosis,
Bcl-2 and pBad-S136 following IL-8 signalling blockage
by siIL-8 treatment.
Western blot analysis indicates that knockdown of
IL-8 causes noticeable reduction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
protein (Figure 5). This observation is mirrored by the
reduction of inhibitory Bad phosphorylation at S136
following knockdown of IL-8 compared to the nontargeting control (Figure 5). Loss of anti-apoptotic proteins
after IL-8 knockdown and cisplatin treatment explains
the increase in apoptosis indicated by the elevation of
caspase activity after IL-8 knockdown and drug treatment
(Figure 4).

We previously reported the expression of IL-8
and IL-8 receptors, IL-8RA and IL-8RB, in benign,
borderline and malignant epithelial ovarian tumours
of different histological subtypes. There was also a
highly significant correlation between IL-8 and IL-8RA
expression levels and tumour stage, being higher in
tumours of higher stage and also with tumour type, with
higher expression in serous carcinoma as compared to
other histological types [21].
High grade serous carcinoma is the commonest
type of ovarian cancer [22]. In this study we focused
on investigating the functional role of IL-8 in platinum
response in high grade serous carcinoma.
Links between resistance to paclitaxel and IL-8 in
ovarian cancer cells have been previously reported. The
paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV-3TR,
showed overexpression of IL-8 [18]. Also paclitaxel can
induce IL-8 gene expression at the transcriptional level
by activating the IL-8 promoter in human ovarian cancer
[19, 20].
Wang et al showed that treatment of non-IL-8expressing A2780 ovarian cancer cells with exogenous
recombinant IL-8 and overexpression of cellular IL-8
induce cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance, while depleting
endogenous IL-8 expression in IL-8-overexpressing
SKOV-3 cells using antisense IL-8 transfection promotes
the sensitivity of the cells to drugs [23]. Their results
suggest a similar link for cisplatin to IL-8 as has been
previously reported for paclitaxel. However Domcke et al
(2013) showed that A2780 and SKOV3 cells are very poor
models of high grade serous ovarian cancer and therefore

Expression of IL-8 receptors in ovarian high
grade serous carcinomas
In order to investigate if our in vitro findings
reflect clinical expression of receptors, we studied the
expression and subcellular distribution of IL-8RA and
IL-8RB by immunohistochemistry in 41 high grade
serous ovarian tumours, which included platinum
sensitive (n = 17) and resistant tumours (n = 24).
Expression was seen at variable intensity in the majority
of tumours (Figure 6). The levels of expression of
IL-8RA and IL-8RB are presented in tables 1 and 2
respectively. No statistically significant correlation was
found between the level of expression of either receptor
and platinum sensitivity, however, nuclear localisation
of IL-8RA was seen in 4 cases, all of which were
platinum resistant (Figure 6D).

Figure 5: The effect of IL-8 knockdown on the expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins. IL-8 knockdown by siRNA
causes reduction of expression of total Bcl-2 protein and in phosphorylation of Bad at serine residue 136. Both of these events are associated
with pro-apoptotic signalling. (cddp = cisplatin)

In the present study we further explored this link
using these intra-patient paired platinum sensitive and
platinum resistant ovarian cancer cell lines that normally
express IL-8 and IL-8 receptors. We show for the first
time that in these clinically derived HGS cells the
expression of IL-8 is enhanced by platinum treatment,
and that this increased expression is consistent in all
4 studied cell lines, reaching a peak at 72 hours post
treatment and then declining to baseline at 96 hours. Using
immunocytochemistry we confirmed the expression of
IL-8 receptors in all cell lines and show that the expression
of receptors also increased on platinum treatment, with
a change in subcellular localisation of IL-8RA into the
nucleus. This is also the first study demonstrating that
treatment with chemotherapeutic agents not only increases
expression of IL-8, but also influences the level of
expression and subcellular localisation of IL-8 receptors.
The results show a significant link between treatment with
cisplatin and enhancing IL-8 signalling activity through
upregulation of expression of both ligand and receptors.
The high expression of IL-8 in the presence of increased
IL-8 receptor expression would set a circuit for autocrine
and paracrine signalling [24], which is known to increase
tumour cell growth, survival, migration and angiogenesis
[25] and as we show platinum resistance and upregulation
of anti-apoptotic proteins. These facts highlight IL-8
and IL-8 receptors as potential therapeutic targets in
management of ovarian tumours.
Our results show that knocking down IL-8 by siRNA
enhances sensitivity to platinum in the platinum sensitive
cell line PEA1 and reverses platinum resistance in the
platinum resistant cell line PEA2. This is demonstrated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by increase in apoptosis as compared to controls
represented by untreated cells or cells treated with nontargeting siRNA. Platinum resistance in PEA2 was also
reversed using an IL-8 receptor blocking agent/antagonist.
This provides promise for the clinical use of anti-IL-8
receptor agents in treatment of platinum resistant cases
in conjunction with platinum based chemotherapeutic
agents to improve drug sensitivity. Knowing the time
line of the rise of IL-8 expression in HGS cells following
platinum treatment as shown in this study helps making
informed plans as to the optimal time of the concurrent
administration of different agents.
It is well established that the effect of platinum
on cells is principally mediated through its reaction
with cellular DNA to cause damage, which finally triggers
the cell’s apoptotic pathway. Previous work in our lab has
identified that platinum mediated DNA damage leads to
a DNA-PKcs dependent activation of pro-survival AKT
signalling , however this happens in platinum resistant
cells only [26]. The data provided here indicates that the
role of IL-8 in platinum response is independent of this
mechanism as inhibition of IL-8 signalling appears equally
effective at enhancing response in platinum sensitive and
resistant cell lines, using the same cell line models as our
previous study.
Changes in the level of expression or activity of
apoptosis related proteins is one of the mechanisms
of development of platinum resistance [27]. We hence
explored the effect of knocking down IL-8 on the
level of 2 anti-apoptotic proteins; bcl-2 and pBAD.
Our results show the downregulation of both proteins
following knock down of IL-8. The findings are in

and were cultured and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium,

Streptomycin and L-Glutamine (all GIBCO, UK) at

antibodies (DAKO, Denmark). Blocking of IL-8-RA/B

agreement with Wang et al. who demonstrated that
the chemoresistance caused by IL-8 is associated
with increased expression of apoptosis inhibitory proteins
(Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and XIAP) [23].
IL-8 mediates its biological effects via the two
receptors, IL-8RA and IL-8RB. IL-8RA binds to
granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 and IL-8 only. In
contrast IL-8RB is more promiscuous and in addition
to IL-8 is activated by several chemokines including
Gro-α,  β and γ, neutrophil activating peptide and
granulocyte activation peptide-2 [28]. Our in vitro work
showed that nuclear localisation of IL-8RA is precipitated
by platinum treatment in the different cell lines. On
studying tumour samples by IHC we found no correlation
between the level of expression of IL-8 receptors and the
status of platinum sensitivity of the tumours. However,
nuclear IL-8RA expression was only found in platinum
resistant tumours. The results suggest the detection of
nuclear expression of IL-8 in an ovarian high grade serous
carcinoma may be a potential marker for identifying a
sub-population of platinum resistant tumours. The fact
that cisplatin treatment increases expression of IL-8
and that decreased expression of IL-8 is associated with
decrease and / or reversal of resistance suggest that it
plays a role in resistance. Provisionally in vitro work
shows that on increase of expression there is nuclear
localisation. As increased expression in vitro is associated
with nuclear localisation, it may be extrapolated that
nuclear localisation can be a marker of resistance or
decreased platinum sensitivity. In the small number of
tumours studied, we only detected nuclear localisation in
resistant cases. This is an initial observation suggesting
that nuclear localisation of IL-8RA may be a potential
biomarker for resistance. However, as the number of cases
studied is small, a larger cohort with known response to
platinum treatment needs to be tested to validate this
observation.
In conclusion, our results show that IL-8 and IL-8
receptor expression by tumour cells increases on cisplatin
treatment, and that IL-8 knockdown increases the cells’
sensitivity to cisplatin. The effect of IL-8 on platinum
sensitivity appears to be mediated via an effect of IL-8 on
anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bad. Our results form
the basis for preclinical and clinical assessment of IL-8
and IL-8 receptors as therapeutic targets in conjunction
with platinum based therapy.

Assessment of IL-8 expression during continuous
exposure to platinum
Matched pairs of platinum sensitive or resistant cells
were seeded into 6 well plates and incubated for 24 hours.
Platinum sensitive or resistant cells were treated with
cisplatin at doses relative to their previously determined
IC50 concentrations (final concentration 2.5  μM or
12.5  μM cisplatin respectively) and incubated for 0,
24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. RNA was prepared from cells
at each time point using RNeasy mini kit according to
manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, UK). IL-8 levels were
determined by qRT-PCR as described below.

siRNA transfection, apoptosis and cell
viability assays
The matched cell line pairs, PEA1/PEA2
and PEO14/PEO23, were transfected with siRNAs
directed to IL-8 or non-targeting control 2 (NT2) (GE
Dharmacon, USA) at 60% confluency and re-transfected
48 hours later. Cells were transfected with siRNAs at
final concentration of 100 nM using DharmaFECT
1 transfection reagent (GE Dharmacon, USA) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-four hours after
second transfection, cells were reseeded into 6 well
plates and incubated for 48 hours. Cell lysates were
collected and RNA extracted using RNeasy mini kit
according to manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, UK).
Caspase activation was measured using Caspase 3/7 Glo
assay (Promega, UK) and activity normalised to cell
viability inferred by MTT assay, performed as described
elsewhere [26, 32].

Immunohistochemistry for IL-8RA and IL-8RB
expression in platinum sensitive and resistant
ovarian tumours

Cells were grown on coverslips for 24 hours at a
concentration of 1 × 104 for PEO1, PEA2, PEO14, PEO23
cells, at 3 × 104 for PEO4 and 9 × 103 for PEA2 cells
respectively. Cells were treated with either cisplatin for
24 hours at a concentration of 5 μM for platinum sensitive
and 25 μM for platinum resistant cells or media only
(untreated). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 30 min at 37°C and rendered permeable in 0.2% triton.
Coverslips were washed with PBS and blocked in 2%
FCS/1% BSA solution for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were
incubated with the primary antibody for IL-8RA (1:2000)
or IL-8RB (1:200) for 1 hour at 37°C. After rinsing in
PBS, the cells were incubated in the secondary antibody
Alexa Fluor 594 (1:600) for 1 hour at 37°C. For negative
control experiments, cells were similarly treated with
the primary antibody omitted. Cover slips were affixed
to slides with mounting media containing DNA-binding
DAPI dye (Vectashield, Vector Labs, UK). Cells were
examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope,
using an x63 oil immersion lens.

The IL-8RA/RB antagonist SCH563705 [30, 31]
was used at a final concentration of 100 nM. Matched
platinum sensitive and resistant cell lines PEA1 and
PEA2 were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 per well in
96 well plates or 2 × 105 per well in 6 well plates and
treated with the antagonist alone and/or cisplatin (10 μM
(PEA1) or 25 μM (PEA2)) for 24 hours. Apoptosis and
cell viability assays were carried out as described above.
Cell lysates were prepared for both RNA and protein
extraction.

Forty-one ovarian tumours, all high grade serous
carcinoma, were studied. Seventeen tumours were from
confirmed platinum sensitive and 24 from platinum
resistant patients who underwent surgery and received
treatment at the Hammersmith Hospital, London, United
Kingdom. Tumour specimens were available as formalin
fixed, paraffin embedded tissue blocks. All slides were
reviewed and representative blocks of the tumours were
selected for the study. Ethics committee approval was
obtained from Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte’s and
Chelsea Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 05/
Q0406/178).
The expression of IL-8RA and IL-8RB was
investigated using an indirect two-stage method. Tissue
sections were de-waxed and rehydrated by passing the
slides through xylene and descending grades of alcohol
then water. Slides were then incubated for 15 minutes with
0.6% hydrogen peroxide solution to block endogenous
peroxidase activity, followed by heat-mediated
antigen retrieval, using 0.1M citrate buffer pH 6.0 and
microwaving for 20 minutes. Slides were then attached to
a sequenza racks. To block non-specific binding 100 μl of
Protein Block were added to each slide for 5 minutes and
the slides were incubated with 100 μl of the corresponding
primary antibody (1:8000 for IL-8RA and 1:400 for IL8RB) at 4°C overnight.
Slides were washed with 0.05% PBS/ Tween
20 solution, followed by 5 minutes incubation with
100 μl of post primary block. After another wash, the

3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution followed by
counterstaining with haematoxylin.
Slides were then dehydrated in ascending grades
of alcohol, cleared with xylene and mounted using Di-NButyle Phthalate in Xylene (DPX) mountant and covered
with a glass coverslip.
Sections of appendix tissue with acute appendicitis
were used as a positive control in each run of staining.
Additionally, the presence of inflammatory cells within the
test sections acted as further internal positive controls. For
negative controls, duplicate slides from each case were
used, and incubated with 100 μl antibody diluent instead
of primary antibody.
The stained slides were then examined by light
microscopy to assess the expression and subcellular
distribution of IL-8RA and IL-8RB. The level of expression
was scored as weak (1), moderate (2) or strong (3).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of normalised caspase activity
and gene expression analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism® version 5.03. The data represented
is mean ± standard deviation (SD) or mean ± standard
error mean (SEM) as indicated. Statistical analysis was
performed using an upaired, two tailed student’s T-test.
The Chi-square test was used to test for the
presence of correlations between antigen expression in
tumours and response to platinum. Significant correlation
was considered with p ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis was
performed using SPSS (version 16.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
