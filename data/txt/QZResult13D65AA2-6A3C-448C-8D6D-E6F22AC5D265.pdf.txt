ABSTRACT
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is characterized by a uniquely aggressive behavior
and lack of effective targeted therapies. After analyzing the gene expression profiles
of seven paired intrahepatic CCA microarrays, a novel sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1)/
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway and a novel target gene, SPHK1, were
identified. We hypothesized that therapeutic targeting of this pathway can be used
to kill intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells. High levels of SPHK1 protein
expression, which was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of samples
from 96 patients with intrahepatic CCA, correlated with poor overall survival. The
SPHK1 inhibitor SK1-I demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity in vitro and
in vivo. SK1-I modulated the balance of ceramide-sphinogosine-S1P and induced
CCA apoptosis. Furthermore, SK1-I combined with JTE013, an antagonist of the
predominant S1P receptor S1PR2, inhibited the AKT and ERK signaling pathways
in CCA cells. Our preclinical data suggest SPHK1/S1P pathway targeting may be an
effective treatment option for patients with CCA.

INTRODUCTION

advanced at diagnosis, with poor liver function for which
only palliative chemotherapy is available [4, 5].
The development of targeted therapies in cancer
can be guided by the identification of tumor-associated
pathways. Several pathways are deregulated in intrahepatic
CCA, including IL-6/STAT3 signaling and growth factors
such as EGF, HGF/MET, and VEGF, and the KRAS/
MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways [6-8]. Although these
pathways contain several potential targets and molecular-

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a relatively rare
hepatobiliary cancer; however, the incidence and mortality
of CCA are increasing worldwide [1-3]. Intrahepatic CCA
is the second most common liver cancer, accounting
for 10%–15% of all primary liver malignancies [4].
Surgical resection is the only potentially curative therapy
for intrahepatic CCA patients; however, most cases are

targeted therapies have been assessed in clinical trials, all
results have been negative and there remains no effective
therapy for refractory CCA [8-9].
We used microarray analysis to identify other
targetable pathways in intrahepatic CCA [10, 11] and
identified a novel sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway
and a potential drug target, sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1).
Bioactive S1P is now recognized as a critical regulator of
cell survival and proliferation, in contrast to ceramide
and sphingosine, which induce cell apoptosis and cell
growth arrest [12, 13]. Sphingosine kinases (SPHKs)
convert sphingosine to S1P and are critical regulators
that determine cell fate. Two isoforms of SPHK enzymes
with distinct functions, SPHK1 and SPHK2, have been
discovered [14, 15]. SPHK1 has oncogenic roles in
proliferation, angiogenesis, and transformation [12].
Increased SPHK1 expression has also been observed in
gastric cancer [16], breast cancer [17], lung cancer [18],
brain tumors [19], colon cancer [20], and lymphoma
[21]. High levels of SPHK1 protein are associated with
poorer outcomes [13]. However, the role and therapeutic
implications of SPHK1 in CCA have not been explored.
In this study of 96 patients with intrahepatic CCA
treated with hepatectomy, overexpression of SPHK1 was
identified as an independent marker of poor prognosis. We
also determined that SPHK1 targeting induced apoptosis
in CCA cells in vitro and in vivo. This preclinical study
provides a rationale for clinical trials with SPHK1 in
patients with CCA.

cytoplasm in MF-CCA (Figure 1A), but is absent in
normal cholangiocytes. Various intensities of positive
SPHK1 expression could be obtained. Overexpression of
SPHK1 was associated with symptoms (p = 0.007) and
elevated CEA levels (p = 0.019); however, only positive
symptoms were independently associated with SPHK1
overexpression (Supplementary Table 2).

Survival and prognostic analysis of MF-CCA
patients after hepatectomy
Ninety-six post-hepatectomy patients with MFCCA (38 men and 58 women; median age 60.9 years,
range 22–83 years) were followed up regularly until
death. The follow-up duration ranged from 1.4 to 111.8
months (median 14.3 months). Overall survival (OS)
rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 59.5%, 24.4%, and 16.6%,
respectively. Univariate log-rank analysis identified the
following factors as adverse influences on OS: presence
of symptoms, decreased albumin levels, elevated alkaline
phosphatase and CEA levels, tumor size >5 cm, positive
surgical margin and lymph node status, and SPHK1
immunostaining (Table 2). However, multivariate Cox
proportional hazard analysis demonstrated that tumor size
>5 cm, non-curative hepatectomy, and positive SPHK1
immunostaining independently predicted an inferior OS
rate for MF-CCA patients after hepatectomy (Table 3,
Figure 1C, 1D, 1E).

and

SK1-I exhibited strong time- and dose-dependent
antiproliferative effects in HuCCT1 and SNU478 cells
(Figure 2A and 2B). CCA xenograft tumors in the control
and treated groups were evaluated by animal PET on
coronal views. Both groups showed one FDG-avid tumor
in the right limb 2 weeks after subcutaneous injection with
HuCCT1 (Figure 2C). The SUV ratio of tumor and muscle
for both groups is shown in Figure 5B. The SK1-I treated
group clearly showed a lower T/M ratio at 4 and 6 weeks
after treatment when compared with control group (Figure
2D, p < 0.0001). Thus, 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection
of SK1-I every other day (3 days/week) resulted in partial
but significant suppression of tumor growth in vivo (Figure
2E, p < 0.001).

Results of bioinformatics analysis
In total, 320 probes with differential expression,
including 49 up-regulated and 271 down-regulated ones,
were identified (Figure 1A). Forty-three known genes
(Supplement Table 1) corresponding to 49 up-regulated
probes were uploaded into PID. Among those genes
within the top ten significant pathways (Supplement Table
2), SPHK1 is a known oncogene [12] and has available
inhibitors [22]. SPHK1 transcript was significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues (Figure 1B). This gene became
the focus of the following studies.

We investigated the effect of SK1-I on the cell cycle
kinetics of HuCCT1 and SNU478 and found that growth
arrest by SK1-I was associated with the accumulation
of cells in sub-G1 phase (Figure 3A). At 10 µM SK1-I,
cell death predominated, with increases in the sub-G1

cells, respectively (Figure 3A). SK1-I also caused a dosedependent increase in apoptosis within 72 h; 73.1% of
HuCCT1 and 61.5% of SNU478 cells were apoptotic
after treatment with 12 μM SK1-I (Figure 3B). This
was also demonstrated by the dose-dependent increase
in cleaved PARP (Figure 3C). PARP cleavage resulted
in simultaneous activation of the caspase pathway, as
indicated by an increase in levels of cleaved caspases 3
and 9 (Figure 3C).

and SNU478 cells treated with SK1-I (6, 10, and 12 µM)
(Figure 4A). SK1-I caused a dose-dependent increase the
staining intensity of ceramide (Figure 4B). These results
suggest that SK1-I regulates interconversion of ceramidesphinogosine-S1P and directs CCA cell into an apoptotic
program.

SK1-I induced cell apoptosis by increasing

We used four paired fresh CCA and normal liver
samples to measure transcript levels of SPHK2, S1PR1,
S1PR2, and S1PR3 by qRT-PCR. Only S1PR2 was
expressed more strongly in tumor tissue than in normal
liver tissue (Figure 4C, p < 0.05).

According to the proposed ceramide-sphinogosineS1P rheostat theory, SPHK activity shifts the intracellular
balance from the pro-apoptotic ceramide and sphingosine
to the mitogenic S1P [13]. Immunofluorescence analysis
to measure ceramide expression showed near undetectable

antagonist, blocked activation of the ERK/AKT
pathways in CCA cell lines

cell lines and tissues [23-25]. We used SK1-I and JTE013
alone and in combination and then used western blotting
to assess activation of the ERK/AKT signaling pathways.
The use of SK1-I or JTE013 alone did not affect ERK/
AKT signaling, but these drugs in combination caused a
dramatic reduction in signaling activity (Figure 4D). Thus,
simultaneous blockade of SPHK1 and S1PR2 may block
the ERK and AKT signaling pathways (Figure 5).

DISCUSSION

induce apoptosis, whereas S1P promotes cell growth,
proliferation, and survival. SPHK1 is responsible for the
conversion of sphingosine to S1P. Therefore, SK1-I, which
is an ATP-competitive SPHK1 inhibitor, might modulate
this rheostat toward cell death by increasing ceramide.
Indeed, in our in vitro study, SK1-I induced CCA cell
apoptosis, as evidenced by the accumulation of cells in
sub-G1 phase and the increasing numbers of Annexin
V-stained apoptotic cells, as well as increasing amounts
of cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9, and PARP. We also found
that intracellular ceramide concentrations increased after
SK1-I treatment. Thus, SK1-I modulates the balance of
ceramide-sphingosine-S1P and directed the CCA cells into
an apoptotic program.
Understanding the mechanisms leading to CCA
formation is important for the development of new and
effective therapeutic options to treat this devastating
disease. Bile acids may play a role in CCA development
and exhibit pro-proliferative effects by activating ERK1/2
and AKT signaling pathways in murine and human
hepatocytes [25]. Studer et al. showed that conjugated
bile acids activate ERK1/2 and AKT signaling through
sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) in rodent
hepatocytes [28]. Liu et al. reported that conjugated bile
acids also sustain CCA growth and invasiveness through
activation of S1PR2 [24] and demonstrated that S1PR2 is
the predominant S1P receptor expressed in human CCA

This study demonstrated that SPHK1 is upregulated
in intrahepatic CCA tissues in comparison to paired
normal liver tissues. Multivariate Cox’s proportional
hazards model showed that SPHK1 protein expression is
an independent unfavorable prognostic indicator of overall
survival following hepatectomy. Our study suggests
SPHK1 overexpression is common in intrahepatic CCA
and represents a novel prognostic marker of disease
outcomes.
The role of SPHK1 has been characterized in a rat
CCA model [26]. Dumur et al. developed an orthotopic
CCA rat model based on bile duct inoculation. They
also developed spontaneously transformed low-grade
malignant rat BDE1 cholangiocytes (BDEsp cells) and
high-grade malignant erbB-2/neu-transformed BDE1
cholangiocytes (BDEneu cells) that closely mimic the
clinical features of early and advanced human CCA
disease. Microarray analysis showed SPHK1 was
overexpressed in both cell types, suggesting SPHK1 is
a putative molecular target with possible relevance to
progressive human cancer. Our findings supported their
hypothesis in the rat model.
The ceramide-sphinogosine-S1P rheostat was
the earliest model in the field of S1P research [27].
According to this model, ceramide and sphingosine

cell lines. S1PR2 expression is also higher in human CCA
tissues compared to non-tumor samples (Figure 4C).
We found diffuse SPHK1 expression in the cytoplasm
of human CCA, but the protein was absent in normal
cholangiocytes. S1P and conjugated bile acids activated
ERK1/2 and AKT signaling through S1PR2 in CCA.
We also identified synergy between an SPHK1 inhibitor
(SK1-I) and a S1PR2 selective antagonist (JTE-013) in
the blockade of ERK1/2 and AKT signaling. Simultaneous
blockade of SPHK1 and S1PR2 may also block CCA
progression.
In conclusion, SPHK1 overexpression was identified
as an independent poor prognostic factor, suggesting the
SPHK1/S1P pathway is a potential therapeutic target in
CCA. The SPHK1 inhibitor SK1-I had potent antitumor
activity against CCA in vivo and in vitro. These preclinical
findings provide the rationale for clinical trials of this
SPHK1 inhibitor in CCA patients.

defined as death that occurred within 1 month of surgery.
Laboratory tests were conducted on the day before
surgery. Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9)
and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were measured
by radioimmunoassay. The tumors were preoperatively
evaluated by abdominal ultrasonography (US), endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
(MRCP), and hepatic arteriography, as appropriate. Tumor
stage was defined according to the pathological tumor
node metastasis classification proposed by the American
Joint Committee on Cancer, 6th edition. This retrospective
study was approved by the institutional review board at
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (clinical study No. 992886B and 102-5813B). All patients provided informed
consent before taking part in the immunostaining study.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Immunohistochemical staining of SPHK1 in
human CCA

Bioinformatics analysis

Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from each
case were reviewed. Specimens from MF-CCA patients
who had undergone hepatectomy were fixed in formalin
and embedded in paraffin. A 4-μm section of each
specimen was stained for stratifin. The primary antibody
against SPHK1 (rabbit anti-SPHK1 antibody, ab61148,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was diluted (1:200) and added to
the slides that were then incubated overnight at 4°C. The
slides were washed three times for 5 min in TBST before
visualization with the DAKO LSAB2 System, Peroxidase
(DAKO A/S, No K0675). Control slides were incubated
with a secondary antibody alone. After washing three
times in TBST for 5 min each, the slides were mounted.
Immunohistochemical staining of stained target cells
was evaluated in 10 optical microscope fields per tissue
section (400× magnification), and the average staining
percentage was calculated. Staining intensity was scored
as 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (intense). H-scores were
calculated as the percentage of positive staining (0–100)
× the correspondent staining intensity (0–3). Specimens
with H-scores of <50 and ≥50 were classified as
immunohistochemically low and immunohistochemically
high expression, respectively [34].

Normalized expression profiles were obtained on
the NimbleGen Platform for seven paired intrahepatic
CCA and adjacent normal liver tissues. Gene expression
data were analyzed by dChip [29, 30]. Differences in
expression between tumor and normal liver tissues
were compared by using the t-test [31, 32]. To identify
important tumor targets, the list of upregulated genes was
uploaded to the Pathway Interaction Database (PID, http://
pid.nci.nih.gov/) [33]. A PID pathway is a network of five
event types (gene regulation, molecule transport, smallmolecule conversion, protein–protein interactions and
black-box processes whose internal composition is not
provided) connected by four participant molecules (small
molecules, RNA, proteins, and complexes). NCI-Nature
Curated pathways, curated by the Nature Publishing
Group editors based on potential drug targets, suggestions
made by users and reviewers, and other molecules known
to be of interest to the cell signaling community, were
exported for further analysis.

Follow-up study

From the archives of Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital, 96 MF-CCA patients who had undergone
hepatectomy between 1989 and 2006 were selected
based on the availability of sufficient tumor samples.
Intrahepatic CCA was defined as carcinoma that arose
from distal second order (or higher) branches of the
intrahepatic ducts. Curative resection was defined
as a negative resection margin observed during

examinations and blood chemistry tests at each visit.
Additionally, serum levels of CEA and CA 19-9 were
measured, and the remnant liver was examined by US
every 3 months. When a new lesion was detected by US or
elevated levels of CEA/CA 19-9 were noted, abdominal CT
or MRCP was performed for confirmation. When patients

complained of bone pain, bone scans were performed to
detect metastasis. If any of the abovementioned procedures
indicated recurrence, the patient was readmitted for a
more comprehensive assessment, including angiographic
evaluation or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The
methods for treating recurrence included surgery, systemic
chemotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, intraluminal
radiotherapy, interventional radiological therapy, and
conservative treatment.

Cells were plated in 6-well plates, incubated for 24
h, and then treated with DMSO and SK1-I. The cells were
trypsinized and fixed in 70% ethanol at −20°C, washed,
and incubated with 10 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma) for 15
min at 37°C, and then stained with 200 μg/mL propidium
iodide (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature before analysis
on a FACSCalibur machine (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson) was
used to model the cell cycle distribution. Experiments
were performed in triplicate and data are expressed as the
mean ± standard deviation.

Cell lines
Two intrahepatic CCA cell lines, HuCCT1 and
SNU478, were obtained from the Japanese Collection of
Research Bioresources (Osaka, Japan) and the Korean
Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea), respectively [35, 36] (35,
36). HuCCT1 and SNU478 cells were routinely cultured
in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY), respectively, supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin, and 100 μg/mL penicillin, in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Apoptotic cell death
Apoptosis was measured using the FITC Annexin
V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences), according to
manufacturer instructions. After a 24-h incubation, cells
were treated with DMSO, SK1-I for 72 h. Cells were
collected and stained with Annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI), and then analyzed using a FACSCalibur
machine. The data were analyzed using CellQuest
software (BD). Experiments were performed in triplicate,
and data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

Reagents
SK1-I was purchased from (Enzo Life Sciences,
NY). JTE-013 was purchased from Cayman Chemical
(Ann Arbor, MI). For the in vitro experiments, 10 mM
stock solutions of SK1-I and JTE-013 were prepared in
100% DMSO and stored at −20°C. For administration,
optimized aqueous SK1-I salts were formulated in D5W.
SK1-I was delivered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at a
dose of 10 mg/kg.

Western blotting
Whole cell lysates of CCA cell lines were obtained
in Pierce RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).
Protein samples were separated on 8%–12% gradient
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA)
membranes. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected
using the ECL blotting analysis system (Millipore).
Primary antibodies against the following targets were
used: cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP,
9541S; Cell Signaling), β-actin (Abcam ab6276), caspase
9 (9508; Cell Signaling), caspase 3 (9662; Cell Signaling),
SPHK1 (9252; Cell Signaling), phospho-Akt (4058; Cell
Signaling), AKT (9272; Cell Signaling), phospho-p42/44
MAPK (Erk1/2) (4376; Cell Signaling), and ERK (SC135900; Santa Cruz).

Viability assay
Cell viability was determined using the TACS
tetrazolium salt 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation
assay kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), according to
manufacturer instructions. MTT is used to determine
cell viability in cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays.
Briefly, cells were seeded at a concentration of 1500
cells per well (HuCCT1 cells and SNU478 cells) in 100
µL culture medium in 96-well microplates. At 24 h postseeding, the cells were treated with DMSO or SK1-I for
48, 72, and 96 h; the cells were then incubated in medium
containing MTT for 2 h. The optical density at 570 nm was
measured using a microplate reader (Spectral Max250;
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

Immunofluorescence microscopy
HuCCT1 and SNU478 cells were grown on fourchamber Permanox slides for 24 h and then treated with
SK1-I (0, 6, 10, and 12 µM) for 48 h. Cells were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature
and then blocked with 5% BSA in TBS for 1 h at room
temperature. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with

Reverse transcription was performed using 3 µg
total RNA with a reverse transcriptase by using a cDNA
kit (Invitrogen), and real-time PCR and quantitative PCR
were performed to assess expression of S1PR1, S1PR2,
S1PR3, and SPHK2 by using primers designed for the
human mRNA sequences [38-40]. Cycling conditions for
real-time PCR included an initial denaturation cycle at
95°C for 15 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles of
95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 60 sec, and a final extension at
72°C for 30 sec, followed by melt curve analysis.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means and standard
deviations (SD). Differences between experimental
animals and controls were calculated using the MannWhitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. The SUV ratio
between experimental animals and controls was calculated
by using the nonlinear trend test. The overall survival rates
were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Sixteen
clinicopathological variables were selected for survival
difference analysis by the log-rank test (univariate).
The Cox proportional hazards model was employed for
multivariate regression analysis. The statistical software
SPSS for Windows (SPSS version 13.0, Chicago, IL)
was used for the statistical analysis and P ≤ 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Tumor xenograft establishment
Twelve male BALB/c nude mice (age, 4 weeks)
were used in the experiments. The animals were divided
into control (n = 6) and experimental groups (n = 6)
and housed in a specific pathogen-free animal facility
with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle (light from 8:00 AM to
8:00 PM) at an ambient temperature of 20°C. HuCCT1
xenograft was established by subcutaneous injection of 106
tumor cells. SK1-I was prepared in PBS (1 mg/mL) and
administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg via an intraperitoneal
injection every other day (3 days/week) over a 6-week
period. The control group received PBS. All animals were
treated under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to
minimize suffering.

(CMRPG3B0363 and CMRPG3B0533 to C. Yeh).

Treatment efficacy evaluation by positron
emission tomography (PET)
All mice underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
(18F-FDG) PET studies at the molecular imaging center,
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou. Serial PET
scans were performed before treatment and at weeks 2, 4,
and 6 after SK1-I treatment by using the InveonTM system
(Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA, USA). Details
regarding radioligand preparation, scanning protocols, and
optimal scanning time are described in our previous report
[41]. Quantification of 18F-FDG uptake in the xenograft
and surrounding normal muscle was performed according
to the recommendations of the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer [42] by calculating
the standardized uptake value (SUV) using the following
