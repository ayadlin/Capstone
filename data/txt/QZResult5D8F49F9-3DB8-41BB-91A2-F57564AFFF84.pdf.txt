ABSTRACT
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important factor in lung cancer
metastasis, and targeting EMT is a potential therapeutic strategy. Fucosyltransferase
IV (FUT4) and its synthetic cancer sugar antigen Lewis Y (LeY) was abnormally
elevated in many cancers. In this study, a traditional Chinese medicine ginsenoside
Rg3 was used to investigate whether its inhibition to EMT and invasion of lung cancer
is by the glycobiology mechanism. We found that Rg3 treatment (25, 50, 100 μg/
ml) inhibited cell migration and invasion by wound-healing and transwell assays.
Rg3 could significantly alter EMT marker proteins with increased E-cadherin, but
decreased Snail, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression. Rg3 also down-regulated
FUT4 gene and protein expression in lung cancer cells by qPCR, Western blot and
immunofluorescence. After FUT4 down-regulated with shFUT4, EMT was obviously
inhibited. Furthermore, the activation of EGFR through decreased LeY biosynthesis
was inhibited, which blocked the downstream MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways.
In addition, Rg3 reduced tumor volume and weight in xenograft mouse model, and
significantly decreased tumor metastasis nodules in lung tissues by tail vein injection.
In conclusion, Rg3 inhibits EMT and invasion of lung cancer by down-regulating FUT4
mediated EGFR inactivation and blocking MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways. Rg3 may
be a potentially effective agent for the treatment of lung cancer.

INSTRUCTION

last few decades, and targeted drugs have been developed
in recent years, the side effects and drug resistance cause
most patients die of cancer invasion and metastasis, with
a 5-year survival rate of less than 15 % [4]. Invasion and
metastasis is the leading factor that result in the failure
of lung cancer treatment and poor prognosis. Therefore,
there is an urgent need to seek anti-metastatic drugs with
explicit mechanisms and explore new targets for lung
cancer.
The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays
an important role in the migration, invasion and metastasis
of tumors. Moreover, EMT shortens progression free

Lung cancer is the most common malignancy
worldwide, and it ranks first in cancer mortality [1].
Approximately 300,000 people are diagnosed with lung
cancer in China every year, and more than 250,000
patients die from the disease [2]. There are generally two
types of lung cancer: small-cell lung cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is the most
common type, accounting for nearly 85 % of cases [3].
Although chemotherapy has made great progress in the

survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients
[5]. A large number of molecular markers and pathways
correlated with EMT have been explored. In the EMT
process, EMT features a series of biological events,
including the decreased expression of the epithelial
marker E-cadherin protein, leading to a lost connection
between epithelial cells and decreased polarity of the
epithelial cells. However, the expression of N-cadherin
and Vimentin is increased, which exhibits a variety of
mesenchymal cell properties, and enhances migration and
invasion potential [6]. The EMT process is regulated by a
set of transcription factors, including Slug, Snail, Twist,
ZEB1 and ZEB2. These transcription factors transform
epithelial state into the mesenchymal state by inhibiting
the epithelial marker proteins expression and inducing the
mesenchymal state-related marker proteins expression [7].
Induced EMT has significantly promoted the metastasis
of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma by
activating some signal pathways, such as TGF-β MAPK
and NF-κB, and these signal pathways affect each other
interactively [8, 9]. EMT can also increase drug resistance
for radiation and chemotherapy [10]. Drugs inhibiting
EMT may be effective agents for lung cancer.
Tumor glycobiology studies indicate that alterations
in the fucosylation of cancer cells closely correlates with
tumor growth and metastasis, et al. Abnormal fucosylation
is catalyzed by the specific fucosyltransferases
(fucosyltransferases, FUTs). FUT4 catalyzes the transfer
of the Fuc of GDP-Fuc to the N-acetylglucosamine of
sugar chain, and it is a key enzyme in the synthesis of
tumor associated carbohydrate antigen Lewis Y (LeY)
[11]. LeY induces the activation of EGFR, and promotes
the migration of oral cancer cells by the glycosylation
of EGFR [12,13]. FUT4 is highly expressed in a variety
of cancers, including stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer,
colon cancer and ovarian cancer, is closely correlated
to tumor proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis and EMT.
However, whether down-regulation of FUT4 can inhibit
EMT in lung cancer is still unclear.
Ginsenosides are active pharmaceutical ingredients
extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine ginseng.
Currently, 40 types of ginsenoside compounds have been
identified, among which, Rg3 is attracting increasing
attention. Rg3 has multiple antitumor effects. Rg3 inhibits
the proliferation of colorectal cancer by inhibiting the
Wnt/ß-catenin pathway [14], promotes apoptosis of
ovarian cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway
[15], inhibits angiogenesis of esophageal cancer induced
by oxygen deficit [16], and inhibits EMT in ovarian cancer
by reducing HIF-1α [17]. Rg3 combined with gemcitabine
or As2O3 decreased the angiogenesis and growth of lung
cancer in mice, respectively [18,19]. Recently, it is
reported that Rg3 could inhibit TGF-β1-induced EMT
in lung cancer, as well as cancer migration and invasion
[20], indicating that Rg3 may be a potential therapeutic
agent that targets EMT. However, whether Rg3 inhibits

lung cancer EMT by down-regulating FUT4 mediated
glycosylation is not clear. In this study, for the first
time, we found that Rg3 effectively inhibited migration,
invasion, EMT and metastasis by down-regulating FUT4
in human lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our
results provide new insights, suggesting that Rg3 may be
a novel anti-metastasis agent to treat lung cancer.

RESULTS
Rg3 inhibited the migration and invasion of
human NSCLC cells
The structure of Rg3 is shown in Figure 1A. To
evaluate the effects of Rg3 on inhibiting the migration
and invasion of human NSCLC cells, we treated A549,
H1299 and H358 cells with different concentration of Rg3
(0, 25, 50, 100 μg/ml) for 24 h. The gelatin zymography
assay showed that the activities of MMP2 and MMP9
were degraded (Figure 1B). Western blot showed that
MMP2 and MMP9 expression was reduced (Figure 1C).
Cell migration was evaluated by wound-healing and
transwell assay with non-coated membrane. We found that
Rg3 clearly inhibited wound closure (Figure 1D) and the
cellular migration through the membrane (Figure 1E). To
detect the alteration in the invasive capability after Rg3
treatment, we used transwell assay by Matrigel precoated
on the membrane, and got parallel results (Figure 1F). The
above studies also showed a dose-dependent manner with
Rg3 treatment. These data suggest that Rg3 can effectively
inhibit the migration and invasion of human NSCLC cells.

Rg3 inhibited EMT of human NSCLC cells
We next examined the ability of Rg3 to inhibit EMT
in human NSCLC cells. A549, H1299 and H358 cells
were treated with different concentration of Rg3 (0, 25,
50, 100 μg/ml) for 48 h. The results indicated a significant
up-regulation of the E-cadherin and down-regulation of
Snail, N-cadherin and Vimentin by qPCR (Figure 2A). The
inhibitory effects of Rg3 on the EMT markers were further
confirmed by Western blot in A549 cells treated differently
with Rg3 for 24 h (Figure 2B). We also found that
E-cadherin staining was enhanced; whereas N-cadherin
staining weakened by immunofluorescent analysis in
A549 cells (Figure 2C). Treating A549 cells with Rg3 at
50 μg/ml for 0, 24, 48, or 72 h, the results were consistent
with an elevated level of E-cadherin and a reduced level
of Snail, N-cadherin and Vimentin by qPCR (Figure 2D),
Western blot (Figure 2E) and immunofluorescent staining
(Figure 2F). These data suggest that Rg3 effectively
prevent EMT in a dose- and time-dependent manner in
NSCLC cells.

tissues (Figure S1D, P < 0.001). We treated A549, H1299
and H358 cells with different concentration of Rg3 (0,
25, 50, 100 μg/ml) for 48 h, and the results showed that
FUT4 expression was suppressed by qPCR (Figure 3A).
The changes of FUT4 protein in A549 cells after Rg3
treatment was further analyzed by Western blot (Figure
3B) and immunofluorescent staining (Figure 3C), and the
results showed that FUT4 expression was down-regulated.
After treating A549 cells with Rg3 at 50 μg/
ml for 0, 24, 48, or 72 h, the results showed that FUT4
expression was reduced by qPCR (Figure 3D), Western

blot (Figure 3E) and immunofluorescent staining
(Figure 3F). Therefore, Rg3 effectively down-regulated
expression of FUT4 in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. After Rg3 treatment, shFUT4 infection, or Rg3
treatment in combination with shFUT4 infection in A549
cells, the expression of EMT marker proteins present a
similar tendency (Figure 3G) as mentioned above. Thus,
these results suggest that Rg3 plays an important role in
inhibiting EMT by down-regulating FUT4 in NSCLC
cells.

shRNA interference sequences (shFUT4) to silence FUT4
expression in A549 cells. As showed in Figure 4A, 4B, 4C,
FUT4 expression was suppressed by shFUT4 compared
with the untreated control and mock transfected cells.
Cell migration and invasion were evaluated in woundhealing and transwell assays. Wound closure (Figure 4D)
and invasion (Figure 4E) were significantly inhibited in
shFUT4 transfected cells. Furthermore, we examined
EMT marker proteins, and found that E-cadherin
expression was increased and N-cadherin expression was
decreased by qPCR (Figure 4F), Western blot (Figure 4G)
and immunofluorescent staining (Figure 4H) in shFUT4
transfected cells compared with the untreated control
and mock transfected cells. These results suggest that
down-regulating FUT4 expression can inhibit migration,
invasion and EMT in lung cancer cells.

To investigate whether down-regulating FUT4
expression inhibited migration, invasion and EMT in lung
cancer, we analyzed the potential correlation between
FUT4 and EMT in lung cancer tissues. We collected
paraffin sections to examine FUT4 and N-cadherin protein
expression, the results showed FUT4 and N-cadherin were
more highly expressed in lung cancer than normal lung
tissues (Figure S2A), and they had the same tendency.
We used Western blot to analyze FUT4 and N-cadherin
protein expression in fresh lung cancer tissues. The
results showed that FUT4 was positively correlated with
N-cadherin (Figure S2B, C, P < 0.05). We also developed

as pERK and pp38 in MAPK signal pathway (Figure
5D). Furthermore, shFUT4 transfection decreased the
expression and activation of NF-κB signaling proteins,
including pp65, pIKB and pIKK. The addition of anti-LeY
antibody, EGFR inhibitor (AG1478) or NF-κB inhibitor
(BAY11-7082) significantly inhibited the activation of
these molecules (Figure 5E), indicating that there is a

crosstalk in the EGFR activated MAPK and NF-κB signal
pathways. Taken together, these results suggest that downregulating FUT4 expression decreased LeY biosynthesis
which leads to the inhibition of EGFR activation, the
downstream MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways in lung
cancer cells.

tumors, and significantly decreased tumor metastasis
nodules in lung tissues by tail vein injection. Thus, Rg3 is
a potential anti-metastasis agent for lung cancer.
Rg3 is an antitumor drug directed at multiple
targets. Rg3 induced the apoptosis of breast cancer cells
by inhibiting phorbol ester-induced COX-2 expression
and NF-κB activation [26]. Rg3 inhibited the proliferation
of melanoma cells by down-regulating HDAC3 and
enhancing p53 acetylation [27]. Rg3 suppressed
angiogenesis in HIF-1α-mediated acute leukemia by
inhibiting PI3K and ERK1/2 signal pathways [28]. To
further investigate the mechanism of Rg3 in lung cancer,
we detected the expression of FUT4 in the lung cancer
tissues, and the inhibitory effect of Rg3 on FUT4 in vitro
and in vivo. We found that FUT4 was highly expressed
in lung cancer tissues compared with the normal lung
tissues, and Rg3 significantly down-regulated FUT4
expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Our
study also indicates that down-regulation of FUT4 by
Rg3 is correlated to the EMT in lung cancer cells. FHIT
suppressed the metastasis of lung cancer by inhibiting
micro-RNA-mediated EMT [29], and KY-05009 and
TNIK inhibited the invasion of human lung cancer cells
by down-regulating TGF-β1-mediated EMT [30]. In
our present study, we also found that Rg3 suppressed
migration, invasion and EMT in lung cancer cells. These
findings suggest that Rg3 is a important inhibitory EMT
agent by targeting FUT4 in lung cancer.
FUT4 is the key enzyme in the synthesis of LeY.
Our previous data confirmed that FUT4 cDNA transfection
upregulated FUT4 expression and increased LeY
biosynthesis level; whereas down-regulated FUT4 with
shFUT4 inhibit LeY biosynthesis [31]. The elevated LeY
located on EGFR could induce the activation of EGFR.
LeY can induce the activation of EGFR, and promote the
migration of cancer cells by the glycosylation of EGFR;
whereas anti-LeY antibody inactivated EGFR. In this
study, we found that the LeY level and the activation of
EGFR (pEGFR) was significantly decreased in shFUT4transfected A549 cells. EGFR is a critical upstream
molecule, and involved in the crosstalk among many
signal  pathways [32]. Because of the complex of EMT,
it is possible that the overlapping and cross-talk pathways
are interacted [33]. EGFR activation can induce the both
MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways which are involved in
EMT. Platycodin D which is an active triterpenoid saponin
from Platycodon grandiflorum inhibited migration,
invasion, and growth of MDA-MB-231 human breast
cancer cells via suppression of EGFR-mediated Akt and
MAPK pathways [34]. EGFR/NF-κB signal pathway
is correlated with EMT and metastasis. DLC-1 (Loss of
deleted in liver cancer-1) induced mitochondrial apoptosis,
and inhibited EMT in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
by targeting the EGFR/Akt/NF-κB pathway [35].
Scutellarein which is botanical extract bezielle inhibited
the proliferation of human lung cancer through ERK and

To further investigate the inhibition of Rg3 in EMT
and metastasis in vivo, A549 cells were inoculated into
nude mice. The tumor volume and weight were analyzed
in the control and Rg3 treatment group. As shown in
Figure 6A, 6B, Rg3 treatment significantly reduced tumor
volume and weight in xenografts. Rg3 didn’t have obvious
changes about the body weight of the xenograft mice
(Figure 6C). FUT4 expression was examined by Western
blot (Figure 6D) and immunohistochemical staining
(Figure 6E). The results showed that Rg3 treatment
group had a lower expression of FUT4 compared with
the untreated control group. EMT marker proteins were
examined, and the Rg3 treatment group had a higher
expression of E-cadherin and a lower expression of Snail,
N-cadherin, and Vimentin by Western blot (Figure 6F),
and a similarly stronger staining of E-cadherin and a
weaker staining of N-cadherin by immunohistochemical
staining (Figure 6G) compared with the control group.
These data showed that Rg3 significantly inhibited EMT
in vivo. To further examine the inhibition of Rg3 in tumor
metastasis, A549 cells were injected into mice via the tail
vein. Tumor metastasis nodules in Lung tissues of Rg3
group were less and smaller than that control group after
treatment for 2 months (Figure 6H).

DISCUSSION
Currently, the primary therapeutic agents for
lung cancer include cisplatin, pemetrexed and erlotinib.
Cisplatin exhibits an anti-tumor effect by impairing the
structure and function of DNA, whereas the action of
pemetrexed is through regulating intracellular folatedependent metabolism and inhibiting cancer cell
replication and proliferation. Erlotinib is an EGFRtargeted drug that inhibits tumor growth by suppressing
EGFR and its downstream signal pathways. However,
clinical data have shown a limited application of these
drugs at tolerated doses due to their toxic side effects and
drug resistance [21, 22]. Recent years, a capsule named
Shen-Yi, which contains Rg3 as its main ingredient,
was approved by the CFDA for cancer therapy, Rg3 is a
beneficial adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer because
it has the capacity to enhance the patients’ immune
and improve quality of life [23]. Rg3 can enhance the
sensitivity to chemotherapy when used in combination
with cisplatin or docetaxel [24, 25]. In our study, we
investigated the ability of Rg3 to inhibit the EMT of
lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that the
inhibition of Rg3 in lung cancer EMT was dose- and timedependent. Moreover, in vivo, our study indicated that
Rg3 could suppress the volume and weight of xenograft

NF-κB mediated by EGFR [36]. We found that downregulating FUT4 by Rg3 and shFUT4 transfection reduced
LeY biosynthesis, inhibited EGFR activation, and blocked
the downstream MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways.
Therefore, FUT4 can regulate those effectors (FUT4/LeY/
LeY-EGFR/MAPK and NF-κB/EMT markers), which
triggers EMT occurrence. The mechanistic detail is shown
in Figure 7, which helps to state the novel idea of this
paper clearly.
Studies have revealed that changes in glycosylation
closely correlated with EMT in tumors. For instance,
GnT-3 inhibited EMT by changing the glycosylation
of E-cadherin, which reduced the phosphorylation of
β-catenin [37]. However, GnT-5 promoted EMT by
activating EGFR signaling [38]. Overexpression of
GALNT14 promoted the occurrence of EMT [39]. In our
previous study, we found that FUT4 inactivated GSK3b
by inducing PI3K/AKT phosphorylation and further
elevated Snail and promoted EMT. However, it was not
clear whether FUT4 and EMT are correlated in lung
cancer. Our results revealed that both FUT4 and EMT
marker N-cadherin were consistently elevated in the lung
cancer tissues, indicating there was an intrinsic linkage
between them. The further study showed that downregulating FUT4 increased E-cadherin, and decreased
Snail, N-cadherin and Vimentin in lung cancer cells, and

thus, hindering EMT. The mechanism exploration of
FUT4 in EMT confirmed that the down-regulated FUT4
could decrease LeY biosynthesis, block EGFR-activation,
as well as inactivate MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways
as shown in Figure 7. FUT4 is an effective target in
suppressing lung cancer EMT.
In summary, we found that Rg3 inhibited lung
cancer migration and invasion, possibly by inhibiting
EMT. In addition, a high expression of FUT4 was closely
correlated with EMT in lung cancer. Down-regulation
of FUT4 could decrease the expression of EMT marker
proteins. These evidence showed that FUT4 could be a
potential target for the regulation of EMT, which may be
an attractive strategy in inhibiting invasion and metastasis
in the treatment of lung cancer. Rg3 could significantly
inhibited FUT4 expression. Therefore, we hypothesized
that FUT4 is an important target of Rg3’s inhibition EMT
in lung cancer. Among these characteristics, Rg3 is an
efficient, low-toxicity and multi-target traditional Chinese
medicine, and it is expected to become an important agent
in the comprehensive treatment of lung cancer, which may
improve the current strategy of lung cancer therapy. The
molecular mechanism of Rg3’s inhibition in the invasion
of lung cancer by targeting EMT, which may be a more
effective therapeutic strategy.

Figure 7: Schematic of the antimetastasis mechanism of Rg3 Schematic to illustrate the hypothetic mechanism that Rg3
down-regulates FUT4 expression, reduces LeY biosynthesis, inhibits EGFR activation by decreasing the biosynthesis
of EGFR-carrying LeY, blocks MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways, thus, inhibits migration, invasion and EMT.

Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 5 mmol/l CaCl2 (18 h, 37 °C). The
gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie blue R250 and
destained in 10% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid in H2O.
MMP2 and MMP9 level were detected as transparent
bands on the blue background of a Coomassie blue-stained
gel.

All lung cancer paraffin sections and lung cancer
tissues were obtained from the First Affiliated Hospital
of Dalian Medical University. The lung cancer tissues
were kept in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction. Human
NSCLC A549, H1299, H358 cell lines were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA). A549, H1299, H358 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(TransGen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (TransGen) at
37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2.

Reagents

Wound-healing assay

20 (R)-Rg3 was provided by Dalian Fusheng
Pharmaceutical Company (Dalian, China). Rg3
was dissolved in serum-free culture medium, and
filtered through a 0.22 mm sterile membrane. The
sources of regents were as follows: AG-1478 (Selleck
Chemicals, USA); BAY11-7082, EGFR, pEGFR, ERK,
pERK, pp38 and p38 (Beyotime); MMP2, MMP9,
E-cadherin, FUT4 and GAPDH (Proteintech); Snail,
N-cadherin and Vimentin (Bioworld); LeY (Abcam);
UEA (LifeSpan BioSciences); p65, pp65, IKB, pIKB,
IKK and pIKK (CST). The primers were as follows:
Snail,
CAGACCCACTCAGATGTCAAGAA(F),
GGGCAGGTATGGAGAGGAAGA(R),
E-cadherin,
CAACGACCCAACCCAAGAA(F),
CCGAAGAAACAGCAAGAGCA (R), N-cadherin,

CTTGAC(F), GCTTGGAAACATCCAC ATCGA(R),
GAPDH, GTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA(F), GCTTCA
CCACCTTCTT GATGTCAT (R).

Cells were seeded in 6-well plate for 24 h. The
monolayers were scratched with a 200 μl pipette tip, and
washed with media without serum to remove the detached
cells. The wounded areas were observed and imaged under
microscope.

Migration and invasion
Cell migration and invasion were performed in
a 24-well plate with 8-mm pore size chamber inserts
(Corning, New York, NY, USA). For migration assays,
the cells (4×104 /well) were placed into the upper chamber
with the non-coated membrane. For invasion assays, cells
(1×105 /well) were placed into the upper chamber with
the Matrigel-coated membrane, which was diluted with
serum-free culture medium. In both assays, cells were
suspended in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium serum-free,
and seeded into the upper chamber. In the lower chamber,
800 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum was added. After incubation for 24 h at
37 °C and 5% CO2, the chambers were fixed with 100%
methanol for 20 min, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet
for 15 min. Images were captured with an Olympus BX83
fluorescence microscope (Japan).

days for 3 weeks via intraperitoneal injection, whereas
the control group received PBS only. Tumor volume and
the whole body weight were measured every three days
after tumor inoculation. The tumor volume was computed
according to the following formula: tumor volume (mm3)
= 1/2 × a (tumor length) × b2 (tumor width). At the end
of the experimental period, all animals were sacrificed
by cervical decapitation, the tumor tissues were excised
aseptically, and the weight was recorded and used for
further study.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to
measure the mRNA expression. Cells were plated into
a 6-well plate for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted using
TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using
PrimeScriptTMRT reagent kit (Takara, Japan). qPCR
reaction was performed in a Thermal Cycler Dice system
(Takara, Japan). The PCR program included 45 cycles
of 95 °C for 1 sec and 60 °C for 5 sec. Quantified data
were normalized to GAPDH, and the relative quantity was
calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method.

Immunohistochemical staining in xenograft
tumors

Western blot

The excised tumor tissues were fixed in 5%
formalin for 24 h before being embedded in paraffin
and sectioned (5 μm sections) in a standard manner. The
slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated using standard
techniques. Non-specific binding sites were blocked with
complete serum at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, the tissue
sections were incubated with the primary antibody at 4
°C overnight. The sections were allowed to incubate in
a humidified chamber for 1 h at room temperature. The
slides were incubated for 10 min at room temperature
with a secondary antibody. After blocking the endogenous
peroxidase activity with methanol and hydrogen peroxide,
the slides were incubated with a streptavidin-peroxidase
complex. Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen to
the protein. The signal was visualized with peroxidaselabeled streptavidin-complexed DAB, and the sections
were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin (HE). A
yellowish-brown stain indicated a positive result. Images
were captured with an Olympus BX51 microscope
(Japan).

Cells and tumor tissues were lysed. Protein
concentration was determined with Coomassie protein
assay reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard.
Total protein was run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed
by transferring to a nitrocellulose filter membrane (NC),
and blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST for 2 h.
The membrane was incubated with the primary antibody
overnight followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG
or goat anti-mouse IgM, and HRP-linked antibody for 1 h.
An enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system
(Bio-Rad) was used to visualize immunoreactive bands.

Immunofluorescent staining
After washing with PBS, cells plated on cover slips
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells
were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5
min. After being blocked with complete serum for 30 min
at 37 °C, the cells were incubated with primary antibody at
4 °C overnight. The cells were then incubated with FITCconjugated goat anti-mouse IgM or TRITC-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
for 1 h. Images were captured with an Olympus BX83
fluorescence microscope (Japan).

Development of tail vein injection lung cancer
models
The 4-6 week old male nude mice (Balb/c-nu/
nu) were obtained from Animal Center (Dalian Medical
University). A549 cells (2×106) suspended in 200μl of
PBS were injected into the tail vein of the mice. Rg3
group mice were treated intraperitoneally with Rg3 (10
mg/kg body weight) once every three days for 2 months.

Xenograft tumor models of human NSCLC
Male nude mice (Balb/c-nu/nu) were obtained from
Animal Center (Dalian Medical University). The animals
(4-6 weeks of age) were housed in specific pathogen-free
(SPF) environment, and provided sterile food and water ad
libitum. The mice were acclimatized for one week before
being used for experiments. A549 cells (2×106) suspended
in 200μl of PBS were injected subcutaneously into the
right flank of the mice. After one week of the injection,
tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into Rg3 and
control groups (n = 5 per group). Rg3 (10 mg/kg body
weight) was administered to mice at once every three

Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as mean ± SEM of three
independent experiments with GraphPad Prism software.
The Student’s t-test was used to make a statistical
comparison between groups. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
