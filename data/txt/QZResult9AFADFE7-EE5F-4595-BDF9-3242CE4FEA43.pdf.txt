BACKGROUND: Cisplatin reduces plasma ghrelin levels through the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor. This may cause cisplatininduced gastrointestinal disorders and hinders the continuation of chemotherapy. The authors of this report conducted a prospective,
randomized phase 2 trial to evaluate the effects of exogenous ghrelin during cisplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Forty-two
patients with esophageal cancer who were receiving cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assigned to either a ghrelin
group (n ¼ 21) or a placebo group (n ¼ 21). They received either intravenous infusions of synthetic human ghrelin (3 lg/kg) or saline
twice daily for 1 week with cisplatin administration. The primary endpoint was changes in oral calorie intake, and the secondary endpoints were chemotherapy-related adverse events; appetite visual analog scale (VAS) scores; changes in gastrointestinal hormones
and nutritional status, including rapid turnover proteins, and quality of life (QoL) estimated with the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL core questionnaire (QLQ-C30). RESULTS: Two patients were excluded from the final analysis:
One patient suspended ghrelin administration because of excessive diaphoresis, and another patient in the placebo group failed to
monitor the self-questionnaire. Food intake and appetite VAS scores were significantly higher in the ghrelin group than in the placebo
group (18.2  5.2 kcal/kg/day vs 12.7  3.4 kcal/kg/day [P ¼ .001] and 6.2  0.9 vs 4.1  0.9 [P < .0001], respectively). Patients in the
ghrelin group had fewer adverse events during chemotherapy related to anorexia and nausea than patients in the control group. Significant deterioration was noted after chemotherapy in the placebo group in QoL scores, appetite, nausea and vomiting, and global
health status. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term administration of exogenous ghrelin at the start of cisplatin-based chemotherapy stimuC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy using multiple antitumor agents is an important component of any therapeutic regimen for advance-stage solid tumors.1 Cisplatin plays a central role in the success of such multidrug chemotherapy
regimens for various cancers2; however, it is also associated with an assortment of adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity,
myelosuppression, and gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss. These gastrointestinal symptoms
generally are nonlethal and reversible; however, their high frequency and strength can strongly impair the patient’s quality
of life (QoL) and, in general, may preclude the completion of chemotherapy.
The acute phase of cisplatin-induced gastrointestinal disorders involve increased serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine
[5-HT]) secretion from enterochromaffin cells.3 Consequently, a 5-HT3-receptor antagonist was developed and is widely
used for patients with cancer who are receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy.4 Despite this advance, many patients still
suffer from gastrointestinal disorders because of cisplatin, especially in the later phases of treatment.
Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone (GH) secretagogue receptor and is secreted predominantly
by gastric endocrine cells.5 It induces dose-dependent, GH-releasing activity5,6; stimulates appetite and food intake; and
triggers a positive energy balance through a central mechanism involving hypothalamic neuropeptides.5-9 In rodents, ghrelin increases GH secretion, feeding, and body weight when administered centrally or peripherally.7-9 We also reported

previously that intravenous administration of ghrelin
enhanced oral feeding and diminished weight loss in
patients who underwent total gastrectomy10 and
esophagectomy.11
In rodents, cisplatin markedly decreased plasma
ghrelin concentrations, whereas the administration of exogenous ghrelin improved cisplatin-induced decreases in
food intake.12,13 These observations suggested that ghrelin also may be effective in minimizing the gastrointestinal
disorders induced by cisplatin in humans, although there
are huge differences in feeding activity between the 2 species. Accordingly, we undertook a randomized clinical
trial to elucidate the effect of exogenous ghrelin on
patients with esophageal cancer who were receiving cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2
study enrolled 42 patients with advanced esophageal cancer who received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The Human Ethics Review Committee of Osaka
University School of Medicine approved the study protocol, and a signed consent form was obtained from each enrolled patient before study entry in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. This study was registered on the
University Hospital Medical Information Network
(R000005924). It began in February 2010, and enrollment of patients ended in January 2011. The eligibility
criteria for the study were as follows: 1) histopathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus; 2) stage II or III disease according to criteria of the
International Union Against Cancer (UICC), sixth edition14; 3) ages 20 to 80 years; 4) no esophageal obstruction by tumor and capacity for oral intake of soft solid
foods; 5) adequate function of major organs; 6) no other
active malignancy; 7) an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status (PS) of 0 or 1; and, 8) provision of written informed consent. The exclusion criteria
for the study were as follows: 1) pregnant or potentially
(willingly) pregnant women; 2) a past history of other
chemotherapy or radiotherapy; and, 3) patients judged to
be ineligible by the investigator.
A coordinating center (a section of the Department
of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Medical
School) was responsible for creating the treatment allocation code using a computer-generated randomization table with a statistician. Patients were randomized at a 1:1
ratio to receive intravenous infusion of either synthetic
human ghrelin (3 lg/kg) or placebo (saline). Treatment
4786

allocation was arranged before the beginning of chemotherapy. The study was performed in a single-blind manner, ie, without knowledge of allocation to the patients.
Calculation of Sample Size

We estimated that oral intake of food calories during the
study period in the placebo group would be 1600  300
kcal/day. The power calculation was based on a 20%
improvement by ghrelin administration in oral food
intake calories, with a power of 85% and an a value of
5%, requiring at least 17 patients per study group. Assuming that approximately 20% of patients in each group
would not complete the study, the initial proposal aimed
to recruit 20 patients in each group.
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Regimen

The enrolled patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This was a regimen consisting of either 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and doxorubicin (ACF)3,15 or 5fluorouracil, cisplatin, and docetaxel (DCF).16 Both regimens entailed 2 treatments every 4 weeks. Specifically, the
ACF regimen comprised cisplatin (70 mg) and doxorubicin (35 mg) on day 1 and a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (700 mg/day) for 7 days, whereas the DCF
regimen comprised cisplatin (70 mg) and docetaxel (70
mg) on day 1 and then a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (700 mg/day) for 5 days. Supportive therapy and
prophylaxis against expected side effects was provided. All
patients were premedicated with intravenous ramosetron
hydrochloride (0.3 mg), a representative 5-HT3 receptor
antagonist. This was infused 1 hour before the administration of cisplatin on day 1 and every morning thereafter on
days 2 through 7 (ACF regimen) or days 2 through 5
(DCF regimen). Hypersensitivity reactions were treated
prophylactically with intravenous dexamethasone (8 mg),
which was infused 1 hour before the administration of cisplatin. Adequate hydration was ensured before and after
cisplatin infusion. Additional antiemetics or steroid preparations were recommended in case of grade 3 or greater
anorexia, nausea, and vomiting according to toxicity grading criteria from the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE).17 After completion
of the second cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the
patient underwent curative resection, ie, subtotal esophagectomy with reconstruction by gastric tube, together
with 2-field or 3-field lymphadenectomy.18
Evaluation of Adverse Events and Criteria for
Dose Modifications

Adverse events were evaluated each day of chemotherapy
and were scored by the most severe event in the first cycle
(days 1-28) based on the toxicity grading criteria from the
Cancer

CTCAE by each primary physician. Before starting the
second cycle of chemotherapy, patients were required to
have grade <2 hematologic toxicity. When patients did
not recover within a 2-week delay or had grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity in the first cycle, the chemotherapy was
discontinued, and surgical resection was considered.
Dose modifications in the second cycle were based
on treatment-related adverse events recorded in the first
cycle. In the ACF regimen, the doses of cisplatin and doxorubicin were reduced by 20% for grade 4 neutropenia
that lasted >5 days, febrile neutropenia grade 3, and
thrombocytopenia grade 3. In the DCF regimen, the
doses of cisplatin and docetaxel were reduced by 20% for
the same hematogenic toxicity. The dose of cisplatin was
reduced by 20% in the second cycle in both regimens after
a rise in serum creatinine level above 1.5 mg/dL during
the first cycle. The dose of 5-fluorouracil was reduced by
20% for grade 3 diarrhea and mucositis. After completing 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all patients
were restaged by endoscopy and computed tomography
to evaluate the clinical response to chemotherapy 2 weeks
after the completion of chemotherapy. Clinical responses
were categorized according to criteria based on the World
Health Organization response criteria for measurable disease and the Japanese Society for Esophageal Diseases.19
Study Protocol

The study protocol is summarized in Figure 1A. Patients
who were assigned to the ghrelin group received ghrelin
treatment at a dose of 3 lg/kg body weight diluted in 50
mL saline given over 30 minutes twice daily (before breakfast and before dinner) for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7),
as in our previous studies.10,11 Synthetic ghrelin was prepared and supplied as described previously.10,11 Patients
in the placebo group received a corresponding placebo
(pure saline) infusion in the same fashion. All participants
received the same protocol of intravenous infusion in
both groups, ie, 3000 mL/day from days 1 to 3 and 2000
mL/day from days 4 to 7 of chemotherapy, including 43 g
glucose, 35 millequivalents (mEq) sodium, 20 mEq potassium, 35 mEq chloride, and 20 mEq lactate in 1000
mL.
Endpoints

The primary endpoint of this study was alteration in oral
calorie intake from day 1 to day 7 of chemotherapy.
Patients in this study were served standard meals and were
allowed to receive extra food if desired. All dietary intake
calories were calculated by a national registered dietitian
at Osaka University Hospital by measuring the weight of
each dish diet before and after every meal.10,11 The secCancer

ondary endpoints included changes in appetite, adverse
events, QoL, body weight, nutritional status, hormonal
assays, and blood tests. Appetite profiles were measured
using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), with the questions ‘‘How hungry are you?’’ and ‘‘How full do you
feel?,’’ which were anchored with ‘‘0 not at all’’ and ‘‘100extremely.’’ Patients were instructed to rate themselves by
selecting the scale before each meal that was most appropriate to their feeling at that time. The mean VAS score
was calculated each day. Questionnaires included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core QoL questionnaire (QLQ-C30) before and after
chemotherapy (day 8).20 The QLQ-C30 contains 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and
social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health/QoL scale, and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and
financial difficulties). All scale scores and single items
scores range from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional
scale represents a higher (‘‘better’’) level of functioning,
whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a higher (‘‘worse’’) level of symptoms.
Blood samples were collected before breakfast after
an overnight fast before chemotherapy and on Days 3 and
8 of chemotherapy. The samples were transferred immediately into chilled tubes containing disodium ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and aprotinin, centrifuged at 4 C,
separated for serum sampling, and stored at 50 C. The
plasma samples were mixed with a 10% volume of 1 M
hydrochloric acid before storing at 50 C. Plasma acylghrelin and desacyl-ghrelin concentrations were measured
with a sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay kit according
to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Mitsubishi
Kagaku Iatron, Inc., Tokyo, Japan).21 Total plasma ghrelin concentration was calculated as acyl-ghrelin plus
desacyl-ghrelin concentration. Serum GH, insulin, and
leptin concentrations were measured using a GH ‘‘Daiichi’’ kit (TFB, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), a chemiluminescent
enzyme immunoassay (Fujirebio, Inc., Tokyo, Japan),
and a human leptin radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit (Linco
Research Inc., St. Charles, Mo), respectively. Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels were measured by
RIA (SRL Company Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).

course of food intake calories and appetite score were
tested by using a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at P <
.05. All calculations were performed using the JMP (version 9.0) software program (SAS Institute Inc, Cary,
NC).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

In total, 42 enrolled patients were randomized into either
the ghrelin group (21 patients) or the placebo group (21
4788

patients). One patient (4.8%) in the ghrelin group who
developed excessive diaphoresis during ghrelin infusion,
equivalent to grade 2 according to CTCAE, and another
patient (4.8%) in the placebo group who was unable to
monitor the self-questionnaire because of general fatigue
were excluded from the analysis (Fig. 1B). Table 1 lists the
demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients.
There were no significant differences in the background
characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index, localization of cancer, clinical cancer staging, or chemotherapy
regimen.

the VAS score reflected the changes in dietary intake
between the 2 groups with a significant difference among
them (repeated-measures ANOVA: ghrelin group vs placebo group, P < .0001, Fig. 2B). Notably, the appetite
scores recovered more quickly after day 4 of chemotherapy in the ghrelin group than in the placebo group.

Effect of Ghrelin on Dietary Intake and Appetite
Scoring

The mean dietary intake gradually decreased after cisplatin administration to reach the lowest level on days 5
through 7. After completing chemotherapy, it took
another 4 to 7 days for oral intake to recover and to allow
hospital discharge. Although patients in the ghrelin and
placebo groups reflected this trend, the decline in dietary
intake with chemotherapy was significantly less in the
ghrelin group compared with the placebo group (18.1
kcal/kg/day vs 12.7 kcal/kg/day overall), especially at day
1 (26.7 kcal/kg/day vs 23.1 kcal/kg/day) compared with
day 7 (15.0 kcal/kg/day vs 8.5 kcal/kg/day) (Fig. 2A). In
other words, the improved oral food intake because of
ghrelin administration was more significant in the later
phase of chemotherapy (repeated-measures ANOVA:
Cancer

October 1, 2012

Table 2 details the blood test results before and after
chemotherapy (day 8) in the ghrelin and placebo groups.
There were no significant differences in nutritional parameters before chemotherapy, including hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte numbers, cholinesterase, total
cholesterol, and the rapid turnover proteins (RTP) (prealbumin, retinol-binding protein, and transferrin). In the
placebo group, significant declines after chemotherapy
were observed for hemoglobin, prealbumin, and transferrin, but not for the other nutritional parameters tested.
This RTP finding is consistent with ghrelin preventing
nutritional deterioration because of chemotherapy compared with the placebo group (prealbumin: 26.4  4.6
mg/dL vs 21.7  2.8 mg/dL [P ¼ .042]; transferrin: 205
 18 mg/dL vs 162  32 mg/dL [P ¼ .037]).
With respect to ghrelin and associated hormones,
plasma total ghrelin levels (acyl-ghrelin plus desacyl-ghrelin) significantly decreased after chemotherapy, accounting for 61% of the baseline values (before chemotherapy)
in the placebo group. GH, a target hormone for ghrelin,
and IGF-1, a mediator of GH, consistently tended to
decrease after chemotherapy. However, despite the poor
dietary intake during chemotherapy, leptin tended to
decrease rather than increase after chemotherapy. There
were no significant differences in plasma ghrelin levels
between the groups before and after chemotherapy
because of its rapid turnover. Likewise, the levels of GH,
IGF-1, insulin, and leptin did not differ between the ghrelin and placebo groups.
Adverse Events

Table 3 lists the hematologic and nonhematologic adverse
events during the first cycle of chemotherapy. Diaphoresis
is a known physiologic effect of ghrelin. One patient with
grade 2 diaphoresis was excluded, whereas another with
grade 1 diaphoresis completed the study protocol and was
included in the analysis. Anorexia and nausea are the most
common toxicities reported with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In our study, grade 3 symptoms were noted in
55% (anorexia) and 60% (nausea) of patients in the placebo group. Ghrelin administration significantly reduced

these adverse effects to 15% and 20%, respectively (anorexia: ghrelin group vs placebo group, P ¼ .016; nausea:
ghrelin group vs placebo group, P ¼ .012). Other adverse
effects, including myelosuppression, renal toxicity, and
stomatitis, did not differ significantly between the 2
groups.
Treatment Outcome

Dose modifications were necessary in the second cycle of
chemotherapy for 6 patients (30%) in the ghrelin group
and for 10 patients (50%) in the placebo group according
to the criteria for dose modifications. Thus, patients in
the ghrelin group displayed less toxicity from chemotherapy than those in the placebo group during the second
cycle, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P ¼ .17). Ghrelin administration tended to
reduce the length of hospital stay in the ghrelin group
compared with the placebo group (18.4 days vs 23.5 days;
P ¼ .12). The objective tumor response rate after the second cycle of chemotherapy was not different between the
2 groups: In the ghrelin group, 13 patients achieved a partial response, 6 patients had no change, and 1 patient had
progressive disease (PD); whereas, in the placebo group,
13 patients had a partial response, 4 patients had no
change, and 3 patients had progressive disease. After 2
cycles of chemotherapy, 16 patients in the ghrelin group
and 15 patients in the placebo group underwent curative
4790

resection. There were no significant differences in major
surgical complications between the 2 groups.
Quality-of-Life Evaluation

Patients in the ghrelin group reported significantly better
overall global health status scores after chemotherapy than
patients in the placebo group (52  18 vs 26  13, respectively; P < .0001), although there were no significant differences in the functional scale parameters. With respect
to the symptom scale scores and items, patients in the
ghrelin group scored better after chemotherapy than
patients in the placebo group on nausea/vomiting (ghrelin
group vs placebo group: 16  14 vs 36  29; P < .0001)
and appetite loss (26  14 vs 54  22; P < .0001).
Although the differences were not statistically significant,
patients in the ghrelin group scored better after chemotherapy than patients in the placebo group on fatigue (P
¼ .082). There were no significant differences in other
symptom scales or items (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this prospective, randomized trial, we demonstrated
that the administration of synthetic ghrelin during cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy successfully increased food intake and appetite and decreased the
adverse effects of chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this

is the first report on the usefulness of ghrelin administration during cisplatin-based chemotherapy in humans.
It has been reported that acute gastrointestinal disorders caused by cisplatin involve 5-HT secretion from the
enterochromaffin cells in association with 5-HT3 receptors.3,4 Therefore, the administration of a 5-HT3 receptor

antagonist is effective in the suppression of cisplatininduced nausea and vomiting that occur within 24 hours
after administration.4 However, late-phase chemotherapy-induced anorexia, nausea, and vomiting still are difficult to adequately control. In the current study, the mean

oral intake of calories decreased significantly to about
25% of the baseline level at day 8 after chemotherapy despite the use of a 5-HT3 antagonist.
Several observations suggest that ghrelin may play
an important role in the delayed cisplatin-induced gastro4792

intestinal effects. In rodents, a single cisplatin administration caused a transient decrease in plasma ghrelin
concentration and prolonged suppression of both food
intake and body weight loss.22 Cotreatment with a 5HT3 antagonist did not result in the recovery of ghrelin
levels or dietary activity in that experiment. In our clinical
study, we observed that chemotherapy that included cisplatin reduced plasma ghrelin levels to 67% and 57% of
the baseline levels on days 3 and 8, respectively. In addition, there was a close relation between the extent of
decline in plasma ghrelin, nutritional status, and adverse
events of chemotherapy.23 In the current trial, we demonstrated that the administration of synthetic ghrelin during
chemotherapy successfully increased food intake and
appetite. This effect may be explained by the effect on the
GH/IGF-1 axis. The growth-promoting effect of GH is
mediated, at least in part, by IGF-1.24 However, serum
GH and IGF-1 levels were stable in both groups, probably
because of the rapid turnover of GH. Although this phenomenon was reported previous in earlier studies,14,24 we
should have measured GH and IGF-1 in a brief period.
5-HT3 antagonist also was administered in the current clinical study. Taken together, the acute and delayed
effects of cisplatin on gastrointestinal functions may
involve different mechanisms, and the delayed effects,
which seemingly are not mediated through the 5-HT3 receptor, affect nutrition status in cancer patients more
strongly than the acute effects.
Conversely, recent reports indicate that both the 5HT2C receptor and the 5-HT2B receptor, but not the 5HT3 receptor, mediate cisplatin-induced ghrelin suppression in rodents.13,22 The 5-HT2B receptor is distributed
mainly in gastrointestinal smooth muscle,25 and the 5HT2C receptor is localized in the central nerve system.26
Vagal nerve function may regulate afferent and efferent
signaling, which controls ghrelin secretion through these
5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors. However, in our previous study, ghrelin was administered to patients who had
undergone gastrectomy and esophagectomy, which also
included truncal vagotomy, and we observed significant
effects on appetite and body weight increase.10,11 Therefore, the association between ghrelin signaling and the
vagal nerve remains unresolved.27 In the literature, urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), the major
metabolite of 5-HT, increased rapidly and subsequently
returned to baseline within the first 24 hours after cisplatin administration, and it was associated strongly with
chemotherapy-induced emesis.3,4,12,28 In the current
study, serum 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels on days 3 and 8 of
chemotherapy did not increase significantly compared

with baseline values (data not shown). Thus, because
plasma ghrelin undergoes rapid turnover, our observation
regarding 5-HIAA suggests that 5-HT does not directly
control ghrelin secretion.
In other studies, substance P and neurokinin-1
(NK-1) receptor contributed to the delayed emetic symptoms associated with chemotherapy.29 Accordingly, an
NK-1 receptor antagonist could inhibit the binding of
substance P to the NK1 receptor in the vomiting center.29
Several studies have established that administration of
such antagonists, such as aprepitant, together with the 5HT3 receptor antagonist, lessens chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting in patients who are receiving emetogenic chemotherapy during the first 120 hours after initiation of chemotherapy.30 Although aprepitant was not
used commonly during the study period in our country, it
is now used widely in clinical practice. Although the exact
functional association between ghrelin and NK-1 receptor
still is under investigation, their synergistic effect would
be novel, and it would be interesting to resolve this issue
in a clinical setting in the near future.
Exogenous ghrelin, as expected, successfully
increased oral intake and nutritional status and also maintained QoL during chemotherapy. However, our ultimate
objective is to ease the completion of chemotherapy and
to enhance the overall antitumor effect. In this study, the
required dose modifications in the second cycle of chemotherapy tended to be fewer in the ghrelin group (6
patients; 30%) than in the placebo group (10 patients;
50%). Specifically, modifications in the ghrelin group
were because of 3 episodes of neutropenia, 2 episodes of
thrombocytopenia, and 1 episode of nephrotoxicity;
whereas the reasons for modifications in the placebo
group included 6 episodes of neutropenia, 3 episodes of
nephrotoxicity, and 1 episode of diarrhea. This suggests
that ghrelin can prevent some adverse events directly in
addition to its indirect effects through improvement of
nutritional status. A larger cohort study is needed to verify
this aspect of ghrelin administration.
Another clinical question to be answered is whether
nutritional support during chemotherapy should be provided orally or intravenously.31 Recently, we conducted a
randomized trial to address this issue in patients with
esophageal cancer who were receiving cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. Various adverse effects of the chemotherapy, including hematologic toxicity, were observed less
frequently in patients who received forced enteral nutrition than in those who received parenteral nutrition,
although their total calorie intake was identical (unpublished data). This observation encourages the clinical

application of ghrelin administration, which can physiologically increase oral food intake.
In terms of chemotherapy regimens, for this study,
both the ACF regimen and the DCF regimen were used.
Recently, intensive chemotherapy protocols involving
multiple drugs are in fashion; however, to use such regimens, the adverse effects of the regimen components must
be adequately managed. An appropriate nutrition supplement through oral food intake will be more important in
the future.
In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that
short-term administration of exogenous ghrelin at the
start of cisplatin-based chemotherapy stimulated food
intake and minimized adverse events. We believe that
ghrelin administration could increase the efficiency of
chemotherapy, and we recommend the use of ghrelin in
clinical practice.
