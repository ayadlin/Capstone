Abstract
The differences in function, location, and migratory pattern of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) and
plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) not only point to specialized roles in immune responses but also signify additive and
interdependent relationships required to clear pathogens. We studied the in vivo requirement of cross-talk
between cDCs and pDCs for eliciting antitumor immunity against in situ released tumor antigens in the
absence or presence of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 agonist CpG. Previous data indicated that CpG boosted
tumor-specific T-cell responses after in vivo tumor destruction and increased survival after tumor rechallenges. The present study shows that cDCs are indispensable for cross-presentation of ablation-released
tumor antigens and for the induction of long-term antitumor immunity. Depletion of pDCs or applying this
model in type I IFN receptor–deficient mice abrogated CpG-mediated responses. CD8aþ cDCs and the
recently identified merocytic cDCs were dependent on pDCs for CpG-induced upregulation of CD80.
Moreover, DC transfer studies revealed that merocytic cDCs and CD8aþ cDCs were most susceptible to
pDC help and subsequently promoted tumor-free survival in a therapeutic setting. By transferring wild-type
pDCs into TLR9-deficient mice, we finally showed that TLR9 expression in pDCs is sufficient to benefit from
CpG as an adjuvant. These studies indicate that the efficacy of CpG in cancer immunotherapy is dependent
on cross-talk between pDCs and specific subsets of cDCs. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6428–37. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
In the last decades, technological advances catalyzed a shift
in the treatment of solid tumors from open surgical resection
toward less-invasive (radiofrequency ablation, cryosurgery,
and laser ablation) or noninvasive techniques (high-intensity
focused ultrasound; ref. 1). These techniques not only induce
direct cell death by protein denaturation and membrane
disruption but also induce apoptotic cell death due to cell

damage or vascular disruptions. In situ tumor destruction
hence creates a depot of tumor antigens consisting of dead
and dying cells that becomes instantly available for phagocytes such as dendritic cells (DC). DCs are well equipped to
internalize dying cells and cellular debris and subsequently
process tumor antigens for presentation to T cells. The main
arm of the adaptive immune system to fight cancer is the
activation of tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes
(CTL) that recognize and kill tumor cells. In vivo generation
of CTLs is dependent on the unique mechanism of crosspresentation by DCs; presentation of exogenous antigens on
MHC class I. Exploiting the CTL-priming capacity of DCs is of
major interest for cancer immunotherapy, in particular, to
enhance antitumor immunity after applying in situ tumor
destruction techniques.
We previously developed a murine model in which a
normally lethal melanoma tumor is destructed in situ by
cryoablation (2). The released tumor antigens preferentially
end up in CD11cþ DCs in the draining lymph node (3, 4).
Although cryoablated mice remain tumor free, only approximately 20% to 50% of the mice survive a rechallenge with
melanoma cells, indicating that a minority of the subjects
developed efficient immunologic memory against the tumor.
These findings emphasized the need to boost antitumor
immunity by combining tumor-destructive treatment with
adjuvant immunotherapy. Indeed, administration of the

pDCs in Cancer Immunotherapy

Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 agonist, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides,
immediately after the ablation elevates the numbers of CTLs
in the lymph node and promoted survival rate upon rechallenge up to 90% to 100% (4–6). We aimed to elucidate the
significance of different DC subsets in the induction of CpGmediated antitumor responses after in situ tumor ablation and
the importance of TLR9 in the different DC subsets herein.
The unique ability to cross-present antigens has traditionally been attributed to the CD8aþ subset (7), but recent
reports showed that CD8aCD11b conventional dendritic
cells (cDC) also possess the capacity to present exogenous
antigens on MHC class I (8, 9). These cells were named
merocytic DCs after their acquisition of small particles form
dying cells through a "nibbling" process instead of engulfment.
In contrast to these cDCs, plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) show a
poor functional ability to stimulate naive T cells in mouse (10)
and man (11). The cross-priming capacity of pDCs is still
under debate but seems relatively meager when compared
with cDCs and may be restricted to specific circumstances (12,
13). Yet, pDCs are able to effectively stimulate preactivated or
memory-type T cells and deliver differentiation (10, 11) and
activation (14) signals (particularly type I IFN) for cDCs. The
differences in function, location, and migratory pattern of
cDCs and pDCs may thus not only point to specialized roles in
the elicitation of T-cell responses but also may signify additive
and interdependent relationships, resulting in synergistic
antitumor immunity.
In the present study, we elucidated the specific capacities
and interactions of pDCs and different subsets of cDCs in
(CpG stimulated) immune responses against tumor antigens
released by in situ tumor destruction that requires internalization, processing, and presentation by the DCs in vivo.
Furthermore, we studied whether the exclusive expression
of TLR9 in either cDCs or pDCs would be sufficient for the
induction of tumor-specific CTLs after combined treatment
of ablation with CpG administration.

Materials and Methods
Mice, cell lines, and peptides
C57Bl/6J, B6.C-H2.bm1/ByJ (Kbm1), and B6.SJL.Ptpcra (B6.
CD45.1) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.
TLR9/ mice were obtained from S. Akira (Department of
Host Defense, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Act-mOVA
transgenic mice were a gift from Dr. M. Jenkins (University
of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, NM) and were
bred onto a B6.C-H2bm1/ByJ background (ActmOVA Kbm1).
OT-I mice were bred on a CD45.1 background and crossed
with Kbm1 mice. IFNa/bR (Ifnar/) knockout mice were
kindly provided by Dr J. Sprent (The Scripps Research Institute
Vivarium, La Jolla, CA). Mice were maintained at the animal
facility of the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology)
or at the animal laboratory of the Nijmegen Centre for
Molecular Life Sciences under specific pathogen-free conditions and were used at 6 to 12 weeks of age. All experiments
were in accordance with the guidelines by the Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
International.

Ovalbumin (OVA)-transfected murine melanoma cell
line B16F10 (B16OVA, clone MO5) was kindly provided by
Dr. K. Rock (Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worchester, MA; ref. 15). Cells were
frozen and thawed according to American Type Culture Collection guidelines for B16F10 and cultured as described before
(4). No full authentication was carried out, but the expression
of OVA, TRP-2 antigens, TLRs, MHC class I, and molecules was
tested before the experiments by reverse transcriptase PCR
or flow cytometry. In addition, the growth characteristics
in vitro and in vivo are closely monitored and compared with
previous growth curves. Peptides for the MHC class I–restricted OVA257–264 (SIINFEKL) were obtained from A&A Laboratories. B16-FLT3-L cells were cultured in 5% Iscove's Modified
Dulbecco's Medium supplemented with 20 U/mL penicillin
and 10 mg/mL streptomycin, and 5  106 cells were injected
to establish FLT3-L–producing tumors in C57BL/6 mice.
In situ release of tumor antigens by cryoablation
Mice were subcutaneously injected with 5  105 B16OVA
cells in PBS and Matrigel. After 9 to 11 days of injection,
tumors (7–10 mm) were treated in 2 cycles with cryosurgery
using a CRY-AC device armed with a 6 mm probe (Brymill
Cryogenic Systems). To test long-term tumor protection, the
mice were challenged with 25  103 to 50  103 B16OVA cells
40 days after the ablation of the primary tumor and monitored
for tumor growth. CpG-ODN 1668 (50 -TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT-30 ) with phosphorothioated backbone was obtained
from IDT and injected peritumorally (50 mg per mouse in
2  15 mL) within 15 minutes after ablation. CpG-ODN 1668 is
a type B CpG, similar to the clinical grade available CpG-ODNs
used in clinical trials.
Functional ablation of cross-presenting DCs and pDCs
We used a method that was recently described to functionally ablate cross-presentation in vivo (16). Tumor-bearing
mice were injected with horse cytochrome c (5 mg per
mouse; Sigma) on 2 consecutive days before ablation. At this
time point, the number of CD8aþ DCs was reduced 2- to
3-fold. Other DC subsets (CD11cþCD11bþCD172þ and
CD11cintB220þ) were not affected. pDCs were depleted using
the 120G8 antibody administered 1 and 2 days prior to ablation (0.5 mg per mouse). Rat IgG was used as a control. We did
not observe differences in the number of other lymph node
cells. To analyze DCs from the tumor-draining inguinal
lymph nodes, excised lymph nodes were torn apart using
needles in medium containing collagenase D and DNase
and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Suspensions were dislodged by resuspending, and EDTA was added
before filtration.
Tetramer and intracellular cytokine staining
Seven to 10 days after ablation, blood, spleen, and lymph
node cells were stained with allophycocyanin- or phycoerythrin-labeled iTag OVA-Kb tetramers (Beckman Coulter);
CD8a (clone 53-6.7) and CD44 (clone IM7; eBioscience or
BD Pharmingen). Cytokine profiles were assessed after restimulation with 0.1 mg/mL SIINFEKL peptide. Subsequently,

cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies specific for
CD8 TCRb, CD44, and CD62L, fixed and permeabilized according to Cytofix/Cytoperm kit instructions (BD Pharmingen),
and intracellular cytokine staining was carried out for IFN-g
(clone XMG1.2) and/or TNF-a (clone MP6-XT22; all antibodies were purchased from either BD Pharmingen or
eBioscience). Samples were collected on a LSRII flow cytometer with Diva software (BD Pharmingen), and data were
analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Adoptive transfer of OT-I cells and in vivo cytotoxicity
OT-I SJL splenocytes were enriched for CD8þ T cells by
negative selection according to the manufacturer's instructions (CD8 T cell isolation kit; Miltenyi Biotec). Purity of Va2þ
Vb5þ was typically greater than 98%. Cells were labeled with
1 mmol/L carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), and
5  105 cells were intravenously transferred to mice that were
cryoablated. As a control, the same number of CFSE-labeled
splenocytes from wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6J mice was transferred to the same mice. Four days later, spleens were harvested and CFSE dilution was analyzed in CD8þCD45.1þ
(OT-I) and CD8þCD45.2þ (controls) cells using a LSRII flow
cytometer. To address the killing capacity of endogenously
generated CTLs, splenocytes from CD45.1þ mice were loaded
(1 hour incubation at 37 C) with 1 mg/mL SIINFEKL peptide or
an irrelevant peptide (E1B192–200 peptide; VNIRNCCYI) and
labeled with CFSE in a concentration of 0.1 mmol/L (SIINFEKL) or 2 mmol/L (E1B192–200). A total of 5  106 cells of each
population was injected into mice of which the B16OVA
tumor had been treated with cryoablation with or without
CpG 8 days before. Eighteen hours later, spleens were harvested and the differently labeled CD45.1þ populations were
analyzed using flow cytometry. The percentage killing was
calculated using the formula: 100  [(sample-CFSEOVA/
sample-CFSEcontrol)/(naive-CFSEOVA/naive-CFSEcontrol)  100].
Splenic DC isolation and transfer of antigen-loaded DCs
Spleens were isolated from C57Bl/6 mice 10 to 12 days after
injection with 5  106 B16-FLT3-L cells. Spleens were injected
with collagenase/DNase medium and left for 5 to 10 minutes
before they were cut in small pieces. After occasional resuspending during 20 minutes at room temperature, the preparation was filtered and washed. The single-cell suspension
was loaded onto a 2-fraction OptiPrep gradient (Sigma) and
spun for 20 minutes at room temperature. The low-density
cells were washed and generally contained more than 90%
CD11cint/þ that contained 10% to 15% pDCs (CD11cintBST2þ). Total DC fractions were divided in 2 suspensions of which
the first (cDCs with pDCs) was cocultured overnight with
irradiated (1,500 rad) ActmOVA Kbm1 cells (DC:dying cells ¼
1:3). The second fraction was depleted of pDCs by magnetic
bead sorting and incubated in a similar way (cDCs without
pDCs). Cells were harvested and sorted on fluorescenceactivated cell sorter on the basis of the expression of
CD11c, B220, BST-2, CD24, CD8a, CD172, and CD11b. A total
of 1  105 DCs were injected into each mouse, which is
approximately 4.5  106 per kg. [This is a relatively low
amount of cells compared with what is generally used in

6430

mouse studies, especially in a therapeutic setting. However, human DC vaccinations are generally carried out with
multiple injections (n ¼ 2–3) in average 15  106 cells, which is
0.20  105 to 0.25  105 per kg.]
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad
Software, Inc.). Comparisons of one-variable data were conducted using a 2-tailed unpaired Student's t test. Statistical
analyses of the survival curves were carried out using a logrank test. Bar graphs represent mean levels  SEM. P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results
Conventional DCs cross-present tumor antigens that
are released by in situ tumor ablation
C57Bl/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 5  105
OVA-transfected B16-melanoma cells. When tumors measured 7 to 10 mm in diameter (generally 9–11 days after
injection), the tumor was destructed in situ by cryoablation
(4–6). Mice were additionally treated with 2 injections of
cytochrome c, an initiator of the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway in cells capable of endosome-to-cytosol transport
such as cDCs (16). In agreement with Lin and colleagues
(16), cytochrome c selectively reduced the numbers of
splenic CD11cþCD11b cDCs (generally 2- to 3-fold) whereas other cDC populations (CD11cþCD11bþ) and pDCs
(CD11cintB220þSiglecHþ) were unaffected. After cryoablation
alone, OVA-specific CD8þ T cells were present in blood
(Fig. 1A), spleen, and draining lymph nodes. After in vitro
restimulation with MHC class I–restricted SIINFEKL peptide,
CD8þ T cells expressed the activation marker CD44þ and
produced IFN-g (Fig. 1A). Additional treatment with CpG
significantly increased the numbers of CTLs in vivo. Selective
suicide of cross-presenting cDCs by cytochrome c prevented
the increment of CTLs in both the absence and the presence of
CpG. This indicates that the process of DC cross-presentation
is crucial for the induction of immune responses against in situ
released tumor antigens.
Next, we tested whether pDCs are involved in the generation of tumor-specific CTLs. Both murine cDCs and pDCs
express TLR9 mRNA and are responsive to CpG, but only cDCs
are able to cross-present cell-associated antigens to CD8þ T
cells in vitro (data not shown). pDCs were depleted in
B16OVA-bearing mice using 120G8 monoclonal antibodies
before cryoablation with or without CpG treatment. Compared with control Ig-treated animals, CpG-treated, but pDCdepleted, mice showed reduced numbers of OVA-specific
CD8þCD44þ T cells in blood and IFN-g þCD8þ (CD44þ)
T cells in both spleen and lymph nodes (Fig. 1B). In the
absence of pDCs, OVA-specific T cells were still generated
after cryosurgery alone (no CpG), suggesting that CTL priming
in this model is a unique feature of cDCs but not pDCs. The
injection of CpG also drastically increased the cytolytic capacity to kill SIINFEKL-pulsed CFSE-labeled CD45.1þ target
cells, which was shown to be dependent on the presence of
pDCs during priming (Fig. 1C). It was additionally tested

pDCs in Cancer Immunotherapy

Figure 1. Both cDCs and pDCs are required to benefit from immune potentiating effects of CpG in vivo. A, C57Bl/6 mice were injected with 5  104 B16OVA
cells. When the tumors measured 8 to 11 mm, tumor antigens were released by cryoablation (cryo) of the tumor in situ. Some groups received
cytochrome c (cyto c; 5 mg per mouse intraperitoneally) 1 day before and on the day of the ablation and/or CpG (50 mg per mouse peritumorally) after the
ablation. Eight to 10 days after ablation, blood cells were stained for OVA-Kb tetramers. Cells from spleen and draining lymph nodes (LN) were restimulated
with SIINFEKL peptide and TCR-bþCD8aþ cells were analyzed for the expression of CD44þ and IFN-g þ. B, similar experiments were carried out to study the
involvement of pDCs. pDCs were depleted using 120G8 monoclonal antibodies injected 1 and 2 days before the ablation. C, the killing capacity of the
endogenously induced CTLs was assessed by an in vivo cytotoxicity assay; splenocytes from CD45.1þ mice were differentially CFSE labeled and coated with
SIINFEKL peptide (CFSElow) or E1B192–200 (CFSEhigh) and injected into mice that had been treated with cryoablation 8 days before. Cytolytic capacity
was analyzed 18 hours later by determining the presence of CFSE-labeled cells in the spleen. Mean levels  SEM are shown. Each group consisted of
4 to 6 mice and these data are representative of 2 similar experiments. Naive mice and mice that were tumor free for 40 days after ablation were rechallenged
with 50  103 B16OVA cells to determine long-term tumor protection. Tumors measuring 1,500 mm3 were killed according to the animal welfare guidelines.
Groups consisted of 8 to 12 mice. D, the survival curves of naive, Cryo þ CpG, and Cryo þ CpG þ 120G8 differed significantly (P < 0.05) from that of
cryo only. 120G8 significantly reduced the survival ratio in the cryo þ CpG group.

whether the presence of pDCs during the priming phase of the
immune response was required to induce CpG-mediated longterm immunity. Mice that remained tumor free for 40 days
after cryosurgery received a rechallenge with a lethal dose of
B16OVA tumor cells. As reported previously, only approximately 50% of the cryoablation-only mice survive the rechallenge whereas all animals treated with cryoablation and CpG
survive (4–6). In contrast, pDC-depleted mice did not show
the protective effect of CpG (Fig. 1D). These results indicate
that CpG-mediated protective immune responses to in situ
released tumor antigens are highly regulated by pDCs.
CTL priming after cryoablation is dependent on type I
IFN receptor signaling
One of the hallmarks of pDCs is the production of massive
amounts of type I IFN in response to CpG in vitro and in vivo.
It was tested whether cryoablation with or without CpG
treatment could induce antitumor responses in mice deficient for the type I IFN receptor (IFNa/bR/). As expected,
the efficacy of CpG to increase OVA-specific (Fig. 2A) and
IFN-g–producing (Fig. 2B) CD8þ T cells after cryoablation was
drastically diminished in IFNa/bR/ mice. Coadministration
of CpG increased the in vivo killing of SIINFEKL-loaded target
cells in WT mice (Fig. 2C). Also, IFNa/bR/ mice started
to show increased killing of target cells, indicating that CpG
might stimulate the immune response to some extent even
in the absence of type I IFN signaling.
To dissect whether the disabilities observed in IFNa/bR/
mice were intrinsic for antigen-presenting cells or for the CD8
T cells themselves, IFNa/bR/ mice were injected with
CFSE-labeled WT OT-I cells just after ablation and analyzed
for proliferation by CFSE dilution. In all circumstances where
antigen was released after ablation, OT-I cells were able to
divide (Fig. 2D). However, the absolute numbers of dividing
OT-I cells showed that less cells accumulated in the IFNa/
bR/ mice than in WT mice, indicating that the type I IFN
feedback loop in antigen-presenting cells is important in the
onset of the response. Interestingly, IFNa/bR/ mice also
showed lower numbers of CTL priming after cryoablation
alone, suggesting that type I IFN signaling is involved in the
stimulation of immune responses against in situ released
antigens from dead cells. Because pDC-depleted mice were
able to mount effective CTL responses after ablation only,
these data suggest that other cells may be the source of type I
IFN. Indeed, we previously showed that merocytic cDCs
produce type I IFN upon the encounter with dying cells (9, 17).
pDCs determine cDC maturation and antigen loading in
CpG-modulated responses
To get more insight in cDC subsets and their susceptibility
to pDC-mediated factors, we addressed the antigen uptake
capacity and maturation status of the cDCs directly ex vivo.
Tumor-draining lymph nodes were isolated from 120G8- or
isotype-treated mice 1 to 2 days after cryoablation with or
without CpG treatment. Just prior to the ablation, OVA-Alexa
Fluor 647 was injected in the tumor to determine the ability of
DCs to internalize soluble antigens after ablation with or
without CpG. CpG increased the internalization of OVA-Alexa

6432

Cancer Res; 71(20) October 15, 2011

Fluor 647 by CD11cþB220 cDCs after ablation whereas 120G8
did not seem to have an effect on antigen uptake after ablation
alone (Fig. 3A). Generally, lower uptake of OVA-Alexa Fluor
647 was observed in DCs from 120G8-treated mice injected
with CpG. In all circumstances, approximately 80% of the
CD11cþ cells that had internalized OVA-Alexa Fluor 647
expressed CD11bþ. These CD11b-expressing DCs were present in the draining lymph nodes after CpG treatment, irrespective of 120G8 treatment (Fig. 3B). Also, the numbers of
antigen-loaded CD8aþ DCs and merocytic DCs increased
after CpG treatment, although to a lesser extent. In addition,
the expression of costimulatory markers on cDCs was very
much increased following CpG treatment, in particular, in
CD8aþ DCs and merocytic DCs (Fig. 3C). In pDC-depleted
mice, this CpG-mediated upregulation of CD80 expression
was much less pronounced, suggesting that differences in CTL
priming may be due to impairment of activation of crosspresenting cDCs.
pDCs stimulate the intrinsic cross-presenting ability
of cDCs
In Fig. 3, we showed that the in vivo maturation of especially
CD8aþ cDCs and CD8aCD11b merocytic DCs after combinational therapy of ablation and CpG is dependent on pDCs.
We next studied whether the cross-priming function of resting
cDC subsets was differentially regulated by pDC help. A total
of 1  105 sorted DC subsets, loaded with dying ActmOVA
Kbm1 cells (to prevent direct presentation), were transferred
into donor mice bearing an established B16OVA tumor
(4  4 mm2). Therapeutic vaccinations with CD8aþ cDCs
were not successful. However, when CD8aþ cDCs were
allowed to interact with pDCs during incubation with irradiated cells, almost 40% of the mice were able to clear the
established B16OVA tumor after cDC transfers (Fig. 4). In
line with our previous observations (17), vaccinations with
CD8aCD11b alone already extended the period of tumorfree survival. These CD8aCD11b cDCs were also highly
responsive to "pDC help" as approximately 50% of the mice
survived the outgrowth of a lethal melanoma tumor. DC
vaccination with CD11bþ cDCs cultured in either the absence
or presence of pDCs failed to increase survival. This study
suggests that CD8aþ cDCs and CD8aCD11b cDCs develop
a better intrinsic capacity for immune stimulation when they
are permitted to interact with pDCs.
Exclusive TLR9 expression in pDCs suffices to benefit
from CpG
The expression of TLR9 may be differently regulated in mice
and man with the main discrepancy being the low expression
or absence in human cDCs. To study the significance of TLR9
expression in cDCs versus pDCs, B16OVA melanomas in
TLR9-deficient mice were cryoablated in the absence or
presence of CpG. Cryoablation in TLR9/ mice resulted in
the generation of endogenous OVA-Kbþ CD8 T cells in blood
(Fig. 5A) and IFN-g/TNF-a–producing CD8 T cells (Fig. 5B) in
lymph nodes. Additional treatment with CpG failed to modulate these responses. Interestingly, the efficacy of CpG was
restored when TLR9-deficient mice received a transfer with

as Fig. 2D) and confirmed that exclusive expression of TLR9 in
pDCs stimulates antigen-specific T-cell proliferation (Fig. 5C).
In addition, pDC transfer, but not cDC transfer, enhanced the
in vivo capacity of endogenous T cells to kill SIINFEKL-labeled
target cells (Fig. 5D). In all, these data suggest that the
restricted expression of TLR9 in pDCs, but not in cDCs,
suffices for CpG to further stimulate antitumor immune
responses.

Discussion
Accumulating evidence shows that adaptive immunity is
shaped by cooperation between functionally distinct DC
subsets. Cross-talk may include the transfer of antigenic
material between migratory and lymph node–resident DCs
(18) or cDCs and pDCs (19) that may also synergize to reach
optimal activation (20) and physically interact to stimulate
CTL-mediated eradication of viruses (14). This is the first
study to show the in vivo importance of cDC–pDC cross-talk in
generating productive CTL responses to in situ released tumor
antigens. In cancer therapies where a tumor is instantly
Figure 4. pDCs stimulate the intrinsic cross-priming ability of cDCs against
cell-associated antigens. Spleens of B16-FLT3-L–bearing C57Bl/6 mice
were harvested. Dendritic cells were enriched using a density gradient and
divided in 2 volumes. One volume was depleted of pDCs using magnetic
beads and both volumes were cocultured with irradiated ActmOVA Kbm1
splenocytes (DC:dying cells ¼ 1:3). After 18 hours of coculture and
maturation with CpG (0.1 mg/mL), the cells were sorted and 1  105 cells
were injected into tumor-bearing recipients (tumor size: 4 mm in diameter).
Graphs show survival curves of groups consisting of 6 to 8 mice.

Figure 5. Selective expression of TLR9 in pDCs suffices to benefit from CpG as an adjuvant. B16OVA tumors (7–9 mm in diameter) in TLR9-deficient
mice were subjected to cryoablation with or without CpG. Indicated groups subcutaneously received WT, FLT3-L–grown bone marrow–derived pDCs just after
ablation. The percentages of Kb-OVA–expressing CD8 T cells in blood and IFN-g/TNF-a–producing CD8 T cells in the draining lymph node are shown
in (A) and (B), respectively. C, alternatively, CD8þ OT-I cells were transferred intravenously after ablation and the accumulation was analyzed in the draining
lymph node of the TLR9-deficient mice 3 to 4 days later. D, at day 10 after ablation, mice received control and SIINFEKL-pulsed and CFSE-labeled
target cells and the killing capacity was determined 18 hours after injection. Bar graphs show mean values  SEM of 4 to 6 mice. A–C, *, significantly different

destructed in situ (e.g., radiofrequency ablation, cryosurgery,
and irradiation), tumor antigens become readily available
for phagocytic antigen-presenting cells and thus for presentation to T cells. We have previously shown that CpG synergizes with tumor ablation to induce long-term protection
against tumor rechallenges through activation of tumorspecific CTLs. The same conclusions were drawn when using
B16F10 parental cells instead of OVA-transfected cells (4–6),
indicating that responses to classical tumor antigens follow
similar principles. Here, we conclude that the clinical efficacy
of CpG in mice is critically dependent on the presence of both
cDCs and pDCs and the cross-talk between TLR9-expressing
pDCs and specific subsets of cDCs.
The present data suggest that cDCs are required for the
induction of tumor-specific immunity after ablation. Cytochrome c did not affect MHC class II presentation (16) but
selectively decreased the number of cDCs without affecting
the numbers of pDCs. This finding supports the notion that
the ability of pDCs to phagocytose dead cells and crosspresent exogenous antigens in vivo appears less efficient than
that of cDCs (discussed in ref. 21). Moreover, tumor-specific
CTLs were still present in pDC-depleted animals after abla-

tion, emphasizing the leading role of cDCs and not pDCs for
antigen presentation and cross-priming in this model. CpGlicensed pDCs were reported to cross-prime OT-I cells after
isolation from OVA protein–challenged mice (9 mg per mouse;
ref. 22). Compared with these levels, the amount of antigens
released after ablation may be too low to be able to detect
cross-presentation by pDCs. Functional pDCs were however
required to optimally benefit from CpG-mediated immunotherapy evidenced by significantly lower numbers of tumorspecific CTLs and lower survival rates upon secondary challenge in pDC-depleted mice. In the ablation setting in vivo, the
generation of both endogenous and transferred IFNa/bRþ/þ
OT-I CD8 T cells was dependent on type I IFN signaling,
indicating that type I IFN signaling was important at the level
of antigen presentation but was not an intrinsic defect of the
IFNa/bR/ CTLs.
The promoter elements of CD80-encoding genes include
several IFN regulatory factor 2 sites, which suggest that the
upregulation of CD80 may be a direct result of type I IFN.
CD8aþ DCs and merocytic DCs failed to upregulate the
costimulatory molecule CD80 in response to CpG in vivo
when pDCs were depleted before treatment, suggesting that

the lack of costimulatory signals may have prevented efficient
CTL priming. Although our data strongly implicate a role for
type I IFN production by pDCs, administration of recombinant
IFN-a after cryoablation only slightly increased the influx of
DCs in the draining lymph nodes and the expression of CD80
on cDCs (not shown). It is well possible that pDCs influence
cDCs through other mechanisms as was previously reported in
responses to Listeria monocytogenes. Kuwajima and colleagues
(23) showed that CpG-induced protection from Listeria was
dependent on CD40–CD40L interactions between cDCs and
pDCs and subsequent interleukin 12 production by cDCs.
Although adaptive immune responses against antigens from
a destructed tumor develop following different mechanisms
than those at work in an acute infection model, these data
suggest that the cross-talk between pDCs and cDCs after
cryoablation with CpG may also be costimulation dependent.
It was previously shown in vitro that cross-talk between pDCs
and cDCs requires physical interactions (24). The use of
peptides in an in vitro coculture system as used in the study
of Lou and colleagues (24) does however overcome the antigen
uptake and processing machinery of DCs and may therefore
not be directly translated to our preclinical model where
antigens are derived from dead and dying cells in situ.
Type I IFN signaling was shown to be essential to generate
antitumor responses after ablation both in the presence and
absence of CpGs. In the latter situation, the data suggest that
non-pDCs are the source of type I IFN, as pDC-depleted mice
showed a trend toward increased antitumor responses. Indeed, we previously showed that merocytic DCs are a source of
type I IFN upon an encounter with dying cells (9, 17). The
activation pathways through which immunity is established
against in situ released tumor antigens in such sterile inflammatory conditions are subject of intensive research. Previous
studies indicated that CTL priming against antigens derived
from dying cells injected into the host was independent of
MyD88 but dependent on the type I IFN receptor (9). Similar
results were found in the cryoablation model. In addition, type
I IFN was found essential in local radiotherapy-mediated
tumor control (25). The way in which these tumor cells die
in vivo after ablation can thus be considered slightly immunogenic, but the independency of MyD88/TRIF suggests that

the type I IFN pathway might be an alternative immune
stimulatory pathway in addition to those previously proposed
(26).
In situ tumor destruction techniques are increasingly applied for the treatment of solid tumors. The ad hoc availability
of tumor antigens for immune cells makes these treatments
particular good candidates for combinations with immunotherapy. The use of CpG in clinical trials so far resulted in
variable success (27–30). A common argument on the efficacy
of CpG in immunotherapy is the differential expression of
TLR9 between mouse and man DCs. Others challenged this
argument by showing TLR9 expression in both human pDCs
and cDCs (31) and responsiveness to CpG by monocytederived DCs (32, 33) and FLT3-L–induced blood DCs (34).
An alternative explanation could be suboptimal timing (4) and
routing (6) conditions of CpG administration in patients.
We here conclude that the exclusive expression of TLR9 in
murine pDCs suffices to benefit from the clinical efficacy of
CpG in this murine model. The transfer of WT pDCs, but not
cDCs, into TLR9-deficient animals restored the ability to
cross-prime antigen-specific and functional CTLs. These data
show that although murine cDCs are able to respond to CpG,
the exclusive reactivity of pDCs on CpG suffices to induce
protective immunity. It will be interesting to determine CpG
efficacy in clinical trials that take into consideration the
optimal timing (4) and routing (6) prerequisites of CpG
administration.
