Abstract
Sodium orthovanadate (vanadate) inhibits the DNA-binding activity of p53, but its precise effects on p53
function have not been examined. Here, we show that vanadate exerts a potent antiapoptotic activity through
both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms relative to other p53 inhibitors, including pifithrin (PFT) α. We compared the effects of vanadate to PFTα and PFTµ, an inhibitor of transcriptionindependent apoptosis by p53. Vanadate suppressed p53-associated apoptotic events at the mitochondria,
including the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the conformational change of Bax and Bak, the
mitochondrial translocation of p53, and the interaction of p53 with Bcl-2. Similarly, vanadate suppressed
the apoptosis-inducing activity of a mitochondrially targeted temperature-sensitive p53 in stable transfectants of SaOS-2 cells. In radioprotection assays, which rely on p53, vanadate completely protected mice
from a sublethal dose of 8 Gy and partially from a lethal dose of 12 Gy. Together, our findings indicated that
vanadate effectively suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis by both transcription-dependent and transcriptionindependent pathways, and suggested that both pathways must be inhibited to completely block p53mediated apoptosis. Cancer Res; 70(1); 257–65. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Acute radiation lethality is largely caused by the injury of
particularly sensitive organs, the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract; these injuries are known as hematopoietic syndrome and gastrointestinal syndrome, respectively (1). In
these organs, genotoxic stress induces massive apoptosis,
which causes some of the adverse side effects of anticancer
radiation therapy and chemotherapy that frequently restrict
their use (2). To overcome this dose-limiting toxicity, freeradical scavengers containing an antioxidant moiety such
as a thiophosphate group were developed as radioprotectors
(1, 3). More recently, new radioprotectors that inhibit apoptosis have been introduced. These drugs are intended to
minimize the apoptosis-inducing sensitivity of target organs.

They inhibit proapoptotic components or activate antiapoptotic ones; for example, they inhibit the proapoptotic functions of p53 (4–6), mimic the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins (7), or enhance antiapoptotic pathway(s) by activating the Toll-like receptor 5 signal (8).
Although the molecules responsible for the radiation sensitivity of target organs have not been fully identified, p53 is a
well-known culprit and is considered a good target for therapeutic radioprotection. In fact, mice in which p53 function
has been genetically inhibited show increased resistance to
genotoxic stress from radiation (5, 9). Five chemical p53 inhibitors have been reported: pifithrin (PFT) α (4, 5), PFTμ (6),
sodium salicylate (10), cadmium chloride (11), and sodium
orthovanadate (vanadate; ref. 12). At present, the radioprotective efficacy of only PFTα and PFTμ has been shown in mice
(4–6). All of the inhibitors, except PFTμ, block transcriptional
changes induced by p53, albeit in slightly different manners.
PFTμ, on the other hand, uniquely inhibits the mitochondrial branch of the p53 apoptotic pathway, called the “transcription-independent pathway.” This pathway is activated
by a direct interaction between stress-activated p53 and
mitochondrial Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
and Bak, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol (13–17). PFTμ suppresses this
pathway by reducing the affinity of p53 for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL,
thereby inhibiting the binding of p53 to mitochondria, but
it has little effect on the transcriptional activity of p53 (6).
The available evidence suggested that inhibiting both
p53 pathways would offer the most effective radioprotection from p53-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, although
PFTα mainly inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53
(18, 19), both PFTα and PFTμ protect mice from radiation

lethality due to hematopoietic but not gastrointestinal syndrome (5, 6). Their limited efficacy may be explained by
their restricted, although different, spectra of anti-p53
activities.
Here, we initially found that vanadate had a more potent
antiapoptotic activity than the other three known transcriptional inhibitors of p53. We then sought to clarify how
vanadate exerted such potent protective effects, speculating
that vanadate suppressed both the transcription-dependent
and transcription-independent pathways. Therefore, we focused on the transcription-independent pathway and compared the effects of vanadate with those of PFTα and PFTμ.
We concluded that vanadate indeed suppresses the transcription-independent pathway as well as the transcription-dependent one and that it is a potent radioprotective
agent against both gastrointestinal and hematopoietic
syndrome.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment. MOLT-4 cells and their derivatives were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Wako)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies). SaOS-2 cells and their derivatives were cultured in
DMEM/F12 medium (Wako) supplemented with 10% FBS.
The medium was supplemented with 0.25 mg/mL G418 to
maintain the stable transfectants. To generate the MOLT-4
transfectant harboring a p53-responsive firefly luciferase reporter (MOLT/p53-Luc1), MOLT-4 cells were cotransfected
by electroporation (Gene Pulsar II, Bio-Rad) with p53-Luc plasmid (Stratagene) and a neomycin resistance gene vector
(pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen). To generate SaOS-2 stable transfectants expressing temperature-sensitive (ts) p53, SaOS-2 cells
were transfected with BglII-linearized ts p53 vector or mock
vector [pUSEamp(+)] using FuGENE HD transfection reagent
(Roche). Cells were maintained at 37°C, except for the SaOS-2
ts transfectants, which were maintained at 39°C.
Irradiation (IR) was performed at room temperature with
a 137Cs γ-ray source (Gammacell 40, Nordion International)
at 0.83 Gy/min. Vanadate (Wako), PFTα (Alexis), and PFTμ
(Calbiochem) were added to the culture medium immediately after IR unless otherwise specified. The luciferase activity
was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
was performed as described previously (12).
Flow cytometric analysis. For each sample, 10,000 cells
were analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton
Dickinson). The percentage of apoptosis was determined by
Annexin V-FITC staining using a MEBCYTO Apoptosis kit
(MBL). The percentage of cells losing their mitochondrial
membrane potential (Δψm) and the conformational change
of Bax were measured, respectively, by MitoTracker staining
and immunofluorescence staining with an anti-Bax monoclonal antibody (clone 4F11, MBL), as described previously (12).
The conformational change of Bak was measured with an
anti-Bak polyclonal antibody (Bak-NT, Upstate) using the
same method as for the Bax staining with slight modifications: normal goat serum (Dako) was used as the blocking

258

reagent, and FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories) was used as the secondary antibody.
Immunoblotting analysis. We used the following antibodies: p53 (clone DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PUMA
(Ab-1, Calbiochem), β-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma), Bax
(clone 4F11), Bak (Bak-NT, Upstate), Bcl-2 (clone Bcl-2/
100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), VDAC1 (ab15895, Abcam),
Calnexin (Stressgen), Apaf-1 (clone 24, BD Transduction
Laboratories), cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175, Cell Signaling),
caspase-7 (clone 4G2, MBL), p21 (clone EA10, Calbiochem),
or MDM2 (1:1 mixture of clone IF2 and 2A10, Calbiochem).
To avoid cross-reaction between the peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies and immunoprecipitated immunoglobulins, the anti-p53 and anti–Bcl-2 antibodies were purchased in the peroxidase-conjugated form and used for
direct detection.
Subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractions were prepared as described by Leu and colleagues (16). Because the
mitochondrial fractions also contained endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions are referred to as fraction 1 and fraction 2, respectively. The
protein concentrations of all the samples were determined
using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce)
and equalized.
Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (12). We used anti-p53 DO-1–
conjugated agarose (Calbiochem), anti–Bcl-2 (7/Bcl-2, BD
Transduction Laboratories), and normal mouse IgG as a
negative control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Vector construction. The mitochondrially targeted p53s
were constructed essentially as described by Marchenko and
colleagues (13), which were ligated into the HindIII/KpnI site
of the pUSEamp(+) vector. To generate NH2-terminal fusion
proteins with the mitochondrial import leader peptide from
human ornithine transcarbamylase, a 37-codon–spanning sequence was obtained by PCR using HEK293T genomic DNA as
a template, and the product was ligated to FLAG-tagged p53
by the overlap extension method (20). Because p53 has a polymorphism at amino acid 72, which can be either Pro or Arg, of
which Arg confers a greater apoptotic activity (21), the Pro72 of
each p53 (CCC) was converted to Arg (CGC). The Ala138 of each
p53 (GCC) was converted to Val (GTC) to generate the temperature sensitivity of ts p53. The additional NH2-terminal amino
acid sequences were as follows: FLAG-tagged p53 (Np53),
MDYKDDDDKL; OTC-FLAG–tagged p53 (Lp53),
MLFNLRILLNNAAFRNGHNFMVRNFRCGQPLQNKVQLDYKDDDDKL.
Total body IR. Imprinting control region (ICR) female
mice (SLC, Inc.), aged 8 wk, were irradiated with an X-ray
generator (Pantak-320S, Shimadzu) operated at 200 kV to
20 mA at a dose rate of 0.66 Gy/min. Vanadate and a cyclic
derivative of PFTα (cPFTα) were purchased from Aldrich
and Calbiochem, respectively. All experimental protocols involving mice were reviewed and approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) and performed in strict accordance
with the NIRS Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.

Dual Effect of Vanadate on p53-Mediated Apoptosis

Results
The potent antiapoptotic activity of vanadate is qualitatively different from that of other p53 inhibitors. To assess
the transcriptional activity of p53 in situ, and because MOLT4 cells have a low transfection efficiency, we generated a
MOLT-4 stable transfectant expressing a p53-responsive firefly luciferase reporter (MOLT/p53-Luc1). The luciferase activity in the MOLT/p53-Luc1 cells reached its maximum
6 hours after 10 Gy IR (Fig. 1A and B), quite similar to the
transactivation kinetics of the p53 target genes in the parental MOLT-4 cells after IR (12). We also examined PUMA induction as a marker for the apoptosis-related transactivation
of p53. As expected, all four p53 transactivation inhibitors
suppressed the transcriptional activity of p53 and the induction of PUMA (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Micromolar PFTα was recently reported to inhibit firefly
luciferase activity (22), potentially obscuring the transcriptional activity of p53 by this measurement. However, we obtained a good correlation between the luciferase activity and
the induction of PUMA, indicating that the cellular concentration of PFTα required to inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 was less than that required to inhibit luciferase.
We also examined the effect of the inhibitors on the accumulation of p53. PFTα and salicylate suppressed the accumulation of p53, but the others did not (Fig. 2A; Supplementary
Fig. S1A). We observed a slight suppression of p53 accumulation with 50 μmol/L PFTα, consistent with a previous report
(4), but the induction of PUMA was completely blocked
(Fig. 2A). Therefore, although we found that using PFTα at
its saturation concentration (80 μmol/L) almost completely
blocked p53 accumulation, 50 μmol/L seemed sufficient to
inhibit p53-dependent transcription.
We next investigated the effects of the four inhibitors on
the radiation-induced apoptosis of MOLT/p53-Luc1 cells
(Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S1B). In agreement with our
previous study, which used the parental MOLT-4 cells (12),
800 μmol/L vanadate effectively suppressed apoptosis; however, neither PFTα nor salicylate suppressed it despite their
suppression of the transcriptional activity of p53 (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S1). We also examined cPFTα (23) and
found that its effects were virtually the same as those of
PFTα (data not shown). Although 40 μmol/L cadmium mod-

erately suppressed apoptosis, it was cytotoxic at this and
higher concentrations, and its antiapoptotic activity disappeared at 60 μmol/L. Together, these results show that the
radiation-induced apoptosis in MOLT/p53-Luc1 cells did not
depend entirely on the transcriptional activity of p53, and
therefore, the antiapoptotic activity of vanadate was due,
at least in part, to some other effect.
Because the effects of all the inhibitors tested were virtually identical in the parental and reporter cells (data not
shown), we used the parental MOLT-4 cells in the following
experiments to avoid any potential side effects from G418,
which was used to maintain the reporter cells.
Vanadate suppresses p53-dependent DNA damage–
induced apoptosis. We previously used a genetic approach
to show that the suppression of DNA damage–induced apoptosis by vanadate was specifically mediated by p53 (12).
Here, we confirmed and characterized the effects of vanadate
on p53-induced apoptosis by using several cell systems with
defective or impaired p53 function: p53-knockdown MOLT-4
transfectants expressing p53 small interfering RNA (MOLT/
p53KD-1 and MOLT/p53KD-2; ref. 12), MOLT-4 transfectants
(MOLT/E6-1, MOLT/E6-2, and MOLT/E6-3) expressing
HPV18-E6 (an inhibitor of p53 expression; ref. 24), thymocytes from Trp53−/− mice, and p53-mutated leukemia cell
lines, which all have mutation(s) in the core domain of
p53 (Supplementary Fig. S2; refs. 25–27). All the data we
obtained strongly suggested that the suppression of DNA
damage–induced apoptosis by vanadate was specifically
affected through p53, and suggested that the loss of p53 function enhanced the cytotoxic side effect(s) of vanadate.
We also investigated whether some unknown factor was
involved in the effects of vanadate. First, we examined the
antiapoptotic effect in MOLT-4 cells of several known phosphatase inhibitors. However, these inhibitors did not suppress
the MOLT-4 apoptosis at any of the concentrations tested
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). These findings, along with our similar results with protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (12),
indicated that the suppression of apoptosis by vanadate was
unlikely to be through its phosphatase-inhibiting activity.
We also found that the phosphorylation of Akt, a known
antiapoptotic signal relayed through phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (28),
is increased by vanadate; however, the PI3K inhibitor

LY294002 had little effect on the suppression of apoptosis
by vanadate even when Akt phosphorylation had been reduced below that of the untreated control (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Thus, the upregulation of Akt phosphorylation by
vanadate seems to be unrelated to its suppression of apoptosis. We also expressed the constitutively activated myrAkt1, but it did not increase the resistance of the cells to IR
and completely abolished the effects of vanadate (Supplementary Fig. S3C). These data may indicate that activated
Akt1 enhances the cytotoxic side effect(s) of vanadate or
negatively regulates the suppressive effect of vanadate.
To ascertain whether vanadate or PFTα suppressed p53independent mitochondrial dysfunction, we investigated
their effects on the anisomycin-induced loss of Δψm and
on the apoptosis induced by expressing exogenous Bax (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Anisomycin was used to stimulate cJun NH2-terminal kinase–dependent apoptosis (12, 29), and

260

Bax as a direct activator of mitochondrial apoptosis (30).
Neither vanadate nor PFTα protected the cells from these
p53-independent mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathways. These data also indicate that neither of these agents
is a general inhibitor of mitochondrial apoptosis.
Vanadate suppresses p53-dependent mitochondrial
apoptotic events, but PFTα does not. We further investigated the effects of vanadate and PFTα on mitochondrial apoptotic events, that is, the loss of Δψm and the conformational
changes of Bax and Bak (12, 31, 32). We found that these events
were p53 dependent using p53-knockdown transformants
(Supplementary Fig. S4). The suppression of the Δψm loss
by vanadate was dose dependent, whereas PFTα was ineffective against the loss and showed potent mitochondrial toxicity
at 80 μmol/L (Fig. 3A). [Because PFTα fully inhibited p53-induced transcription at 50 μmol/L (Fig. 2A) and was not toxic at
this concentration, we used it at 50 μmol/L in the following
experiments.] We obtained similar results for the conformational change of Bax and Bak (Fig. 3B and C). Of note, because
the loss of Δψm was low 6 hours after IR (12), we measured it
12 hours after IR, whereas Bax and Bak were activated 6 hours
after IR. These results suggest that, in irradiated MOLT-4 cells,
the activation of Bax and Bak may precede the loss of Δψm,
which may not follow immediately. These results were consistent with the ineffectiveness of PFTα against the radiation-induced apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells and indicated that vanadate,
but not PFTα, suppresses p53-driven transcription-independent mitochondrial apoptotic events. Therefore, we next
investigated the effects of PFTμ on the apoptosis. The suppressive effect of PFTμ exceeded that of PFTα and was slightly less
than that of vanadate; the combined treatment with PFTμ and
PFTα was not much greater than that of PFTμ alone (Fig. 3D).
These data indicated that the transcription-independent p53
pathway is predominant in irradiated MOLT-4 cells. In addition, because PFTμ at 10 μmol/L showed a marked inhibitory
effect on the transactivation of PUMA, we used it at 7.5 μmol/L
in the following experiments.
Vanadate suppresses the transcription-independent
pathway. We next investigated the effect of vanadate on
the transcription-independent p53 pathway in irradiated
MOLT-4 cells. First, we analyzed its effects on the translocation of p53 to mitochondria, a key initial event in this pathway
(13–17), in fractionated MOLT-4 cells. Subcellular fraction 1
contained mitochondria and membrane organelles, including
ER, and fraction 2 contained cytosolic components, as assessed by several marker proteins (Fig. 4A). In fractionated,
irradiated MOLT-4 cells, vanadate treatment caused substantial reduction of the post-IR p53 in fraction 1, and PFTμ had a
moderate effect, but neither altered the amount of p53 in fraction 2. Because p53 was present even in fraction 1 samples
that contained little ER, p53 seemed to be predominantly located at the mitochondria. Vanadate and PFTμ also suppressed the interaction—essential for the direct initiation of
apoptosis—of p53 with Bcl-2 (Fig. 4B). We also investigated
the ability of p53 to bind two other known interaction partners, Bcl-xL and Bak; however, these interactions were weak
in irradiated MOLT-4 cells and therefore unlikely to be important for this form of apoptosis (data not shown). Collectively,

Dual Effect of Vanadate on p53-Mediated Apoptosis

these data indicate that vanadate and PFTμ suppress the
transcription-independent apoptotic events in irradiated
MOLT-4 cells, and PFTα (at least at 50 μmol/L) does not.
Vanadate suppresses the apoptosis-inducing activity of
mitochondrially targeted ts p53. To further characterize the
effects of vanadate on transcription-independent p53-mediated apoptosis, we used p53-null SaOS-2 cells to establish stable
transfectants expressing one of two forms of ts p53s: Lp53 (a
mitochondrially targeted ts p53) and Np53 (originally Nucl
p53; a nucleus-directed ts p53; refs. 13, 14, 21). In this system,
these temperature-shifted ts p53–expressing cells predominantly undergo growth retardation, but a fraction of them
die through apoptosis. Np53 is largely translocated to the nucleus at the permissive temperature (30°C; ref. 14), although
some extranuclear Np53 remains, including at mitochondria
(21). The localizations of Lp53 and Np53 were analyzed by
immunofluorescence staining (Supplementary Fig. S5).
We quantified the transcriptional activity of the temperature-shifted Np53 using a sensitive p53 reporter assay and
found an ∼500-fold induction relative to the level at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 5A). In contrast, Lp53 caused
only a 3-fold induction, which was reasonable because its
transcriptional activity is impaired (14); concordantly, Lp53
did not induce MDM2 and p21 (Fig. 5B). To verify that
Lp53 was imported into mitochondria, we used immunoblot-

ting to detect cleavage of the mitochondrial import leader
peptide, which is fused to Lp53 and cleaved only by the endogenous mitochondrial endopeptidase (Fig. 5B).
We next investigated the expression of the apoptosis-related
Bax, PUMA, active caspase-3 and caspase-7, MDM2, and p21 in
the Np53- and Lp53-expressing cells. MDM2 and p21 were upregulated by the temperature shift, and the upregulation was
suppressed substantially by vanadate (200 μmol/L) and moderately by PFTα (80 μmol/L). Although few changes in Np53
expression were observed after the temperature shift in the
vanadate- and PFTα-treated cells, presumably due to its already robust expression, a slight increase observed in the vanadate-treated cells might have been related to the suppression
of MDM2 induction. Bax was not upregulated in the temperature-shifted Np53- or Lp53-expressing cells (Fig. 5B), and
PUMA was not detected in the cells at all (data not shown),
but both ts p53s induced caspase activation after the temperature shift. Thus, Lp53 is an excellent initiator of the transcription-independent pathway, and we used Np53 as a control for
the normal p53 pathways, including the transcription-dependent pathway. Vanadate suppressed the caspase activation
by both ts p53s, whereas PFTα did not suppress the Lp53-induced but substantially inhibited the Np53-induced caspase
activation. The effects of PFTμ on caspase activation were
the opposite of the effects of PFTα. The corresponding apoptotic

inhibitor of the transcription-dependent pathway.
We also assessed the effects of these p53 inhibitors on the
interaction between the temperature-shifted Np53 and Bcl-2

(Fig. 5D). Vanadate reduced the binding to below the level
at the nonpermissive temperature. PFTμ partially suppressed the binding, and PFTα did not affect it. Collectively,

Dual Effect of Vanadate on p53-Mediated Apoptosis

Vanadate has potent radioprotective activity against
both gastrointestinal and hematopoietic syndrome.
Although vanadate was superior to PFTα in suppressing
p53-dependent apoptosis, especially in the transcription-independent pathway, a radioprotective effect of PFTα in mice
has already been shown (5). We did not find a radioprotective
effect of PFTμ in either ICR or C57BL/6J mice (data not
shown). To avoid potentially confounding side effects from
the cytotoxicity of PFTα, we chose cPFTα as an equivalent
alternative, as a reference for vanadate in our mouse study.
We used 8 and 12 Gy of total body IR (TBI), which induce,
respectively, hematopoietic and gastrointestinal syndrome
in ICR mice (33–36). For the i.p. administrations, we used
20 mg/kg cPFTα and vanadate. This concentration of cPFTα
was a dose determined in previous studies and our pilot study
as double the requirement for PFTα to suppress the hemato-

poietic syndrome (5). The dosage of vanadate was approximately one third its LD 50 value, as assessed in our pilot
study, when delivered i.p. into mice, and was similar to the dose
used in wild-type p53 thymocytes (Supplementary Fig. S2C). No
abnormal behavior and no lethality (Supplementary Fig. S6A)
were observed at this dose of cPFTα or vanadate.
Both treatments protected the mice from a sublethal dose of
8 Gy TBI, which killed two thirds of the control (physiologic
saline injected) mice (Fig. 6A), and there was no significant
difference between the vanadate- and cPFTα-treated subgroups. Vanadate rescued 60% of the mice treated with 12 Gy
TBI, which killed all of the control mice within 12 days, but
cPFTα did not protect them at this lethal dose, as reported
for PFTα (5). The protective effect of vanadate at 12 Gy TBI
was significantly greater than that of cPFTα (P < 0.0002). We
also tested the protective effects of vanadate using a supralethal

dose of 13 Gy TBI (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Although the
vanadate treatment did not rescue these mice, there was a
trend toward prolonged survival, but it was observed only
in 2 of 10 mice. Thus, the dose reduction factor (the fold
change in IR dose to produce a given level of lethality) for
vanadate was estimated to be 1.5 to 1.6, which is good compared with other radioprotectors (1, 3, 35, 36).
Finally, we performed a pathologic study on the bone marrow
of femurs and the small intestine and showed that vanadate efficiently inhibited the reduction of bone marrow cells (bone
marrow aplasia) and relieved the epithelial damage (disappearance of crypts and shortening of villi) more effectively than
cPFTα (Fig. 6B and C), indicating strong correlations with the
survival results. The transcriptional inhibitory effects of them
were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S6C).

Discussion
Building on the results of our previous study (12), here we
showed that vanadate is a bifunctional inhibitor of p53 that
suppresses both its transcription-dependent and transcription-independent pathways. Our data suggest that inhibition
of both p53 pathways is a more potent antiapoptotic strategy
than inhibition of one of them, which is supported by the
limited efficacies of the single-pathway inhibitors PFTα
and PFTμ (5, 6) versus vanadate.
One study showed that p53-knockout mice are protected
from hematopoietic syndrome–induced death but shows
heightened lethality from gastrointestinal syndrome (5).
These results were explained by the severe impairment of
p21–mediated growth arrest that presumably gave the damaged cells some recovery time. The difference in gastrointestinal sensitivity between the genetic approach and the
pharmacologic inhibition used here was probably owing to
the constitutive lack of p53 function in the knockout mice,
which is only temporarily inhibited pharmacologically; in
our pilot study, a single i.p. injection of vanadate 2 hours before 12 Gy TBI did not show any protective activity (data not
shown). The key to safe radioprotection is the short-term inhibition of p53. This is evidenced by the resistance to radiation–induced tumorigenesis when p53 is transiently
inactivated during the acute radiation response in genetically
engineered mice, by the finding that PFTα and cPFTα do not

increase the lethality from gastrointestinal syndrome, and by
the observation that vanadate protects 12 Gy–irradiated mice
from death (Fig. 6; refs. 5, 9). It is possible that part of the radioprotection is mediated by the function of p53 as an inhibitor of mitotic catastrophe, which might recover from the
pharmacologic inhibition before the radiation injury becomes
irreversible.
In irradiated MOLT-4 cells, neither PFTα nor salicylate suppressed apoptosis despite their suppression of p53-dependent
transcription, indicating that this apoptosis does not require
p53-dependent transcription. The suppression of apoptosis
by PFTμ in the cells strengthens this idea. Thus, MOLT-4
apoptosis is a useful system for studying the transcriptionindependent pathway. Alternatively, the transcriptional inhibition of p53 might augment the transcription-independent
pathway. Such augmentation by PFTα was recently reported
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (37).
Although vanadate has an antiapoptotic advantage in
suppressing both pathways, it did not completely suppress
the lethality of gastrointestinal syndrome. We do not regard
this as a practical limit for radioprotection through the
suppression of both pathways because vanadate has a
dose-limiting toxicity, and the bioavailable dose in mice is
substantially lower than that in cultured cells. A less toxic
compound capable of suppressing both pathways may serve
as a therapeutic inhibitor of p53.
