Abstract
This study aimed to identify associations between germline polymorphisms and
risk of high-grade osteosarcoma (HGOS) development, event-free survival (EFS) and
toxicity in HGOS patients treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery.
Germline polymorphisms of 31 genes known to be relevant for transport or
metabolism of all four drugs used in HGOS chemotherapy (methotrexate, doxorubicin,
cisplatin and ifosfamide) were genotyped in 196 patients with HGOS and in 470 healthy
age and gender-matched controls. Of these 196 HGOS patients, a homogeneously
treated group of 126 patients was considered for survival analyses (survival cohort).
For 57 of these, treatment-related toxicity data were available (toxicity cohort).
Eleven polymorphisms were associated with increased risk of developing HGOS
(p < 0.05). The distribution of polymorphisms in patients was characterized by a
higher Shannon entropy. In the survival cohort (n = 126, median follow-up = 126
months), genotypes of ABCC2_1249A/G, GGH_452T/C, TP53_IVS2+38G/C and
CYP2B6*6 were associated with EFS (p < 0.05). In the toxicity cohort (n = 57),
genotypes of ABCB1_1236T/C, ABCC2_1249A/G, ABCC2_3972A/G, ERCC1_8092T/G,
XPD_23591A/G, XRCC3_18067T/C, MTHFR_1298A/C and GGH_16T/C were associated
with elevated risk for toxicity development (p < 0.05).
The results obtained in this retrospective study indicate that the aforementioned
germline polymorphisms significantly impact on the risk of HGOS development,
EFS and the occurrence of chemotherapy-related toxicity. These findings should be
prospectively validated with the aim of optimizing and tailoring HGOS treatment in
the near future.

introduction

systemic pre- and post-operative multidrug chemotherapy.
Standard protocols include doxorubicin, cisplatin, high-dose
methotrexate and/or ifosfamide and/or etoposide, which
allow to cure about 60–65% of patients with conventional
HGOS (non-metatstatic at diagnosis, tumor localized in the
extremities in patients younger than 40 years) [1–3].

High-grade osteosarcoma (HGOS) is the most
common malignant bone tumor arising in children and
young adults. Current treatment of non-metastatic HGOS
consists of surgical removal of the primary tumor and

Pharmacogenomic information regarding the drugs
used in HGOS standard chemotherapy were obtained
in other more frequent malignancies, and potentially
common pathways and functional polymorphisms in these
proteins that influence both chemotherapy toxicity and
outcome were identified (https://www.pharmgkb.org/). On
the other hand, a number of case-control studies revealed
a series of polymorphisms associated with increased
risk for HGOS development (https://phgkb.cdc.gov/
HuGENavigator/startPagePhenoPedia.do, [4]) but none
of these was confirmed by a recent international genomewide-association-study approach [5].
The primary aim of this study was the identification
of germline polymorphisms associated with HGOS
development and comparison of their distribution in the
cohort of controls (n = 470) with the one in the cohort
of HGOS patients (n = 196) by means of informationtheoretical measures. The secondary aim was the
identification of polymorphisms with an impact on
event-free survival (EFS) in a subgroup of 126 patients
with conventional HGOS treated with neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy, including methotrexate, doxorubicin,
cisplatin and ifosfamide, and surgical removal of
the primary tumor. The third aim consisted in the
investigation of associations between genotypes and
treatment-related toxicity in a subgroup of 57 patients with
registered toxic events.

Contingency analyses identified 12 polymorphisms
that were significantly differently distributed in HGOS
patients relative to healthy controls (Table 2). In order
to obtain larger group sizes and thus more robust results,
patients were grouped according to either the dominant
or recessive genotypic model. These analyses identified
one additional polymorphism MTHFR _677T/C (VAR
versus WT + HET, p = 0.021) that was significantly
differently distributed in HGOS patients compared to
healthy controls.
Shannon entropy was computed for all the
polymorphisms and all the three genotypic models
(Figure 1). The difference between the two cohorts was
remarkable: the entropy in patients was higher than the
one in controls in 52% of the cases, while it was lower in
45% of the cases. In the remaining 3% the entropy values
were equal. Besides the simple counting of cases with
higher/lower entropy, it is important to observe that the
cases with higher patient entropy seem to be characterized
by a larger difference of entropy values. To assess this
hypothesis, we applied a Wilcoxon test with a 95%
confidence level. The resulting p value of 0.021 provided
significant evidence that the entropy of the polymorphism
distribution in patients was higher than in controls. The
most notable differences with r, which is the ratio between
patients and controls entropy of a given polymorphism
distribution, greater than 1.5 were found for the following
polymorphisms in the recessive model: ABCC2_3972A/G,
ABCG2_421A/C, ATM_61A/G, TP53_IVS2+38G/C,
CYP2B6*6,
GGH_452T/C,
TP53_IVS2+38G/C,
CYP2C9*3_1075A/C, GGH_452T/C, GGH_401T/C,
GGH_16T/C, hOGG1_1245C/G and XPG_3508G/C.
Cluster index analysis was applied and revealed that
the average values of Tc (which is a clustering significance
measure and was computed as described in detail in the
supplementary information) were much higher in controls
then in patients. In general, the highest Tc values in
controls were about three times the Tc values of patients.
This outcome provided further evidence supporting the
fact that the distribution of polymorphisms in patients was
more heterogeneous than in controls.
To determine whether the differently distributed
polymorphisms were associated also with an increased
risk for HGOS development, simple logistic regression
analysis was performed on the data according to
the dominant or recessive genotypic model. Eleven
polymorphisms resulted to be associated with increased
risk for HGOS development (Table 3).

results
To assess the effect of the different alleles of
each polymorphism, data were classified as follows:
“Wild-type” (WT) as homozygous status of the most
frequent allele as reported in the reference public database
(Table 1), “Hetero” (HET) as the heterozygous status of
the variant allele and “Variant” (VAR) as the homozygous
status of the variant allele.
In order to enable 2x2 table and logistic regression
analyses genotypic data were also categorized in two
groups according to 1) the dominant model: WT versus
HET + VAR and 2) the recessive model: WT + HET
versus VAR. For three polymorphisms without public
frequency data, WT was classified as follows: DHFR_
Ins/Del (rs70991108) and TYMS_1494del6 (rs16430)
homozygous without deletion; TP53_PIN_IVS3+16bp
(rs17878362) homozygous without insertion.

osteosarcoma patients

Frequencies of the WT, HET and VAR status of all
polymorphisms were calculated for the healthy controls
(n = 470) and the total cohort of patients with HGOS
(n = 196) (Table 2). Genotype frequencies of controls were
similar to those reported in public databases demonstrating
its representativeness.

To identify genotypes with impact on clinical
outcome, survival analyses were performed for each
polymorphism in a subgroup of 126 HGOS patients with
homogeneous clinico-pathological features and treatment

Toxicity associated with genotypes in
osteosarcoma patients

(Table 4). This subgroup was representative of the whole
patient series since frequency distributions of all genotypes
and clinico-pathological parameters were similar to those
of all the 196 patients (Tables 2 and 5).
Four
polymorphisms,
ABCC2_1249A/G,
GGH_452T/C, TP53IVS2 + 38C > G and CYP2B6*6,
were significantly associated with EFS in univariate
analysis (Figure 2). Worse EFS was associated with the
genotypes HET + VAR of ABCC2_1249A/G (A), VAR of
GGH_452T/C (B), WT + HET of TP53IVS2 + 38C > G
(C) and VAR of CYP2B6*6 (D). However none of
these genotypes, which we defined as “risk genotypes”,
retained statistical significance by multiparametric
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (data not
shown). By using the true median EFS times as input
data, all four polymorphisms reached a power of at least
55% (range 46–100%) (type I error 5%) to detect survival
differences between the two groups characterized by the
different genotypes.
Based on the evidence that the aforementioned
risk genotypes individually impacted on EFS, we
stratified patients into four risk groups. Nine patients
were excluded because they did not have data of all these
four polymorphisms. As shown in Figure 3, patients
carrying three or four risk genotypes (n = 4) performed
significantly worse, compared to patients with two
(n = 32), one (n = 40) or none (n = 41) risk genotypes (A).
This difference was even more evident when patients with
one or two risk genotypes were grouped together (B).
None of the genotypes resulted in a statistically
significant association with any of the clinical parameters
shown in Table 4, which did also not impact on survival
(data not shown).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Possible associations between chemotherapy-related
toxicity and polymorphisms were evaluated in a subgroup
of 57 patients enroled in the ISG/OS-1 protocol. For these
analyses, genotype data were categorized according to the
dominant model in WT and HET + VAR, in order to avoid
too small sample sizes.
Eight polymorphisms proved to be significantly
associated with toxic events (Table 6). Significant
predictivity was confirmed for five of them by multiple
logistic regression analysis (Table 6). Neurotoxicity
was registered in four patients (7%), but no predictive
polymorphism was identified. Nephrotoxicity and
stomatitis were registered in one patient each (2%) and
were therefore not included in association analyses.
Because of the different toxicity profile of
methotrexate compared to doxorubicin, cisplatin and
ifosfamide, logistic regression analyses were performed to
estimate the relative risk for the occurrence of toxic events
in relation to the drugs administered (Table 7). Considering
methotrexate cycles, WT status of ABCC2_3972A/G
was associated with nausea and vomiting, as well as
ABCB1_1236T/C (HET + VAR), ABCC2_1249 (WT)
and GGH_16T/C (WT) with transaminases increase
grade 4. All three polymorphisms remained significant
for transaminases increase grade 4 by multiple regression
analysis (Table 7).
Regarding doxorubicin, cisplatin and ifosfamide
cycles, a higher risk for leukopenia was associated with the
presence of at least one variant allele of ABCC2_1249A/G
and MTHFR_1298A/C. ABCC2_1249A/G (HET + VAR)

Multiple regression analysis confirmed the

leukopenia (Table 7).

Although high-grade HGOS is the most common
malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents,
pharmacogenomic markers still cannot be used for patient
stratification or treatment modulation [9]. Since scarce

40% of HGOS patients, and the four backbone drugs

of HGOS chemotherapy can cause severe short- and
long-time toxic events [10], there is urgent need to identify
pharmacogenetic markers that can identify patients with
higher risk for unresponsiveness and/or to develop
drug-related toxicity.
More than 100 polymorphisms were reported
in association with HGOS [4], but few of them were
correlated with clinical parameters, survival and the
development of toxic events, e.g. [9, 11, 12]. Therefore,
we aimed to analyze polymorphisms known to be
involved in the pathways of all four drugs used in
HGOS chemotherapy in a well documented series of
HGOS patients in order to address all these questions at
the same time.
We observed 12 polymorphisms associated with
an increased risk for HGOS development including
five polymorphisms of genes being important in the
folate metabolism, two polymorphisms of DNA repair
genes, two polymorphisms of the ABCC2 transporter,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and three of the apoptosis pathway. The variant allele
of the MDM2_309T/G polymorphism was reported to
be associated with sarcomas, including osteosarcoma,
by several studies including meta-analyses [13–15]. The
wild-type allele of TP53_ex4+119G/C was reported in
association with risk of HGOS in two studies [16, 17] but
not confirmed in one meta-analysis [13].
With respect to survival-related genotypes, the
HET + VAR status of ABCC2_1249A/G, the VAR status
of GGH_452T/C and CYP2B6*6 and the WT  +  HET
status of TP53_IVS2+38G/C were associated with
worse EFS. Given that these genes do not belong to the
same pathway and are not reciprocally associated, a coevaluation identified three groups with significantly
different survival probabilities suggesting that these
four polymorphisms have a combined effect on survival.
To our knowledge, these polymorphisms have not been
reported as prognostic factors in HGOS patients so far,
but a similar approach has recently identified five other

ABCC2 are known to influence the bioavailability of drugs
and therefore could contribute to a reduced chemotherapy
efficacy [21, 22].
GGH catalyzes the removal of polyglutamates,
preferencially
from
long-chain
methotrexate
polyglutamates, thus influencing the overall effectiveness
of methotrexate [23]. The VAR status of GGH_452T/C
was found in children with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia who showed exclusively low or intermediate
catalytic activity of GGH with the consequence of
intracellular accumulation of long-chain methotrexate
polyglutamates [24].
Our data suggest that in HGOS this polymorphism
plays a different role, since they indicated that the VAR
status of GGH_452T/C might reduce the effectiveness
of methotrexate treatment in HGOS patients. It would be

polymorphisms with combined effect on EFS [18]. On
the other hand, several studies reported polymorphisms
associated with survival that were analyzed also in our
study, although they did not reveal any prognostic impact
(e.g. ABCB1_1236T/C [11], drug-metabolizing enzymes
[19]). The observation that different polymorphisms
can impact similarly on EFS could be explained by the
genomic complexity and heterogeneity of HGOS, by the
different drugs used for treatment, nonetheless by the
small number of overlapping polymorphisms analyzed in
the different studies.
Doxorubicin, methotrexate and cisplatin are known
substrates of ABCC2 and this protein was the third most
expressed ABC transporter in a series of HGOS cell lines
[20], although ABCB1 is the best described biological
prognostic marker in HGOS [3]. Polymorphisms of

therefore interesting to analyze whether the GGH_452T/C
variant affects the hydrolytic activity of this enzyme also
in HGOS cells.
Since the VAR status of CYP2B6*6 was described to
result in decreased expression and activity of this enzyme
in liver cells [8, 25], patients with HGOS might be less
responsive to ifosfamide, which is activated by CYP2B6.

Regarding the role of TP53_IVS2+38G/C, we
hypothesize that although the VAR status is associated
with a high risk for HGOS development, patients seem
to respond better to treatment and therefore have a higher
probability of EFS compared to those with WT + HET
status. However, these four polymorphisms were not
associated with necrosis evaluated after pre-operative

chemotherapy (data not shown) and differed from those
described in other studies ([12, 18], drug-metabolizing
enzymes, for review see [19]). Therefore the direct impact
on survival needs still to be elucidated.
Among the polymorphisms associated with
hematological toxicity, the HET + VAR status of
ABCC2_1249A/G was associated with leukopenia and
thrombocytopenia grade 4 and the necessity of red blood
cells and platelet transfusion. This association remained
significant even in multiple regression analysis and was
associated prevalently to doxorubicin/cisplatin/ifosfamide
treatment which can be ascribed to the fact that both
doxorubicin and cisplatin are substrates of ABCC2.
Another variant associated with leukopenia grade 4
was the HET + VAR status of MTHFR_1298A/C, which
was reported in association with anemia after methotrexate
cycles in HGOS patients [12].
Hepatotoxicity was associated with the WT
status of ABCC2_1249A/G and GGH_16T/C and
with the HET + VAR status of ABCB1_1236T/C.
All three polymorphisms remained significant by
multiple regression analyses in relation to the complete
treatment and to the methotrexate administration.

Since polymorphisms of ABC-transporters are known
to influence the bioavailability of several drugs
[26], and methotrexate is substrate of ABCB1 and
ABCC2, our findings suggest that the variant allele of
ABCB1_1236T/C increases toxicity in hepatic cells due
to a lower activity of the enzyme. Conversely, the variant
allele of ABCC2_1249A/G is protective. Since there are
no pharmacokinetic studies available in HGOS patients
these assumptions need confirmation by functional studies.
To our knowledge, the functional role of
GGH_16T/C polymorphism is still unknown. Our
observation suggests that WT status could be associated
with higher accumulation of methotrexate long
chain polyglutamates, thus increasing cytotoxicity in
hepatic cells.
Independently of the administered drugs, WT status
of ABCC2_3972A/G was associated with nausea and
vomiting. The mechanism underlying this association has
yet to be elucidated since no data were reported.
A peculiar feature of this study was the application
of the information-theoretical measures Shannon entropy
and cluster analysis to genotyping data to support the
interpretation of polymorphism distributions in patients

and healthy controls by objective means. It is noteworthy,
that among the eleven polymorphisms with r > 1.5, four
were associated with risk to develop HGOS, three with
impact on survival, and two with toxicity.
In order to obtain information regarding the potential
functional effects of the polymorphisms analyzed in the
present study, two web-based SNP bioinformatic tools
were explored to predict their regulatory potential, as
indicated by specific in silico scores (<https://snpinfo.
niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/snpfunc.htm>; <http://compbio.
cs.queensu.ca/F-SNP/> and references therein). Several
of the polymorphisms that resulted to be associated with
survival, toxicity and/or risk for HGOS in this study also
showed scores > 0.5 that indicated a relevant functional
impact. This group included three polymorphisms
associated
with
survival
(ABCC2_1249A/G,
GGH_452T/C, CYP2B6*6), seven associated with toxicity
(ABCC2_1249A/G, ABCC2_3972A/G, ERCC1_8092T/G,
XPD_23591A/G, XRCC3_18067T/C, GGH_16T/C,
MTHFR_1298A/C), and three associated with risk
for HGOS (ABCC2_1249A/G, ABCC2_3972A/G,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GGH_16T/C). This evidence indicates that the
polymorphisms emerged in our study as associated to
survival, toxicity and/or risk for HGOS also have a
predicted relevant functional impact, which however needs
to be explored and confirmed in further functional studies.
In summary, since the ABCC2_1249A/G
polymorphism was associated with risk of HGOS
development, worse EFS and hematological toxicity,
and presented a relevant predicted functional impact,
it should be prioritized for further validation studies in
order to definitely estimate its relevance for a possible
use as patients stratification marker. Furthermore, our
data indicate to consider in addition to ABCC2_1249A/G,
also TP53_IVS2+38G/C, GGH_452T/C and CYP2B6*6
in a prospective screening because of their demonstrated
prognostic value. ABCB1_1236T/C, ABCC2_3972A/G,
XPD_23591A/G, ERCC1_8092T/G, XRCC3_18067T/C,
MTHFR_1298A/C, GGH_16T/C polymorphisms should
be further validated within a prospective trial with
registered toxic events to fully determine their value as
markers for patient stratification.

Materials and methods

non-metastatic at diagnosis, arisen in patients younger
than 40 years) treated with standard neoadjuvant
chemotherapy protocols based on doxorubicin, high-dose
methotrexate, cisplatin and ifosfamide in association
to surgery (“survival cohort”). Median follow-up of the
survival cohort was 126 months (range 73–345 months).
From this cohort of 126 patients, toxicity data
were available for 57 patients (“toxicity cohort”) treated
according to the ISG/OS-1 protocol [27]. Median
follow-up of the toxicity cohort was 118 months (range
73–142 months). Toxicity assessment was performed
before each chemotherapy cycle and graded from 0 to
4 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE) v4.0.

Patients and study design
A total of 196 patients with newly diagnosed HGOS
(all recruited and treated at the Rizzoli Orthopaedic
Institute, Bologna, Italy between 1984 and 2005) (Table 4)
and 470 healthy controls (individuals without cancer at
the time of enrollment, who were recruited at the National
Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy) were considered in order to
identify polymorphisms associated with the development
of HGOS (Figure 4). In order to match as much as possible
the healthy controls to the patients cohort, all individuals
over 40 years were excluded from the original pool of
1,000 healthy individuals. After this step, the control
group showed a male/female ratio (1.55) and a median
age (33 years) that were as close as possible to those of
the patient cohort (male/female ratio: 1.65; median age
16 years). All individuals were of Caucasian ethnicity and
had signed an informed consent. The study was approved
by the institutional ethical review boards.
The impact of polymorphisms on clinical outcome
was evaluated in a subgroup of 126 patients with
conventional HGOS (high-grade tumor of the extremities,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DNA isolation and polymorphism screening
Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen
lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood samples or
normal muscular tissue using the High Pure PCR Template
Preparation Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany). DNA quality and concentration were checked
by spectrophotometry using the NanoDrop ND-1000
(NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).

Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses for
polymorphisms affecting the same gene were carried
out by using the freely available LDPlotter software in
both healthy controls and total patients cohort. Strong
LD (with D’ > 0.95 and r2 > 0.75) was found only for the
polymorphisms of GGH in both healthy controls and total
patient cohort.
The Shannon entropy of the distribution of each
polymorphism was computed in both the cohorts,
patients and controls. Missing values were assigned a
special symbol, which was then added to the alphabet
of symbols used to denote the specific instance of each
polymorphism.
The cluster index [31, 32] was computed to identify
genotype groups within the same pathway (transport,
DNA repair, folate cycle, apoptosis or detoxification)
that behaved similarly in HGOS patients compared to
healthy controls. Detailed description of the Shannon
entropy and cluster index analyses are provided in the
Supplementary_Information File.
Two-tailed Fisher’s exact or chi-square tests were
used to correlate genotypes with clinical and biological
parameters and to evaluate statistical associations between
different variables. Two-sided p values < 0.05 were
considered as significant.

Based on literature search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/pubmed), 45 polymorphisms and two haplotypes of
31 genes involved in transport, metabolism, activation and
detoxification of the four drugs used in standard HGOS
chemotherapy (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin and
ifosfamide), as well as in apoptosis or DNA repair were
selected for genotyping (Table 1).
Pyrosequencing (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden),
TaqMan genotyping with pre-designed SNP assays
(Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA), PCR or
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis
were performed as described (Table 8). Primer sequences
and genotyping reaction details are available on request.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive frequencies are provided for all variables
in the data sets of the three cohorts. Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium was assessed by standard methods for each
polymorphism in both the healthy controls and total
patients cohort. No deviations were found in the healthy
controls, whereas few deviations were found in the total
patients cohort (Table 1). However, these polymorphisms
were not excluded from the study because these deviations
may originate from their biological impact in HGOS.

Logistic regression analysis was performed to
estimate the odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95%
confidence interval (CI) of each possible risk factor for the
occurrence of adverse events.
Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated from
diagnosis until the date of the first adverse event
(relapse of the tumor at any site or death of disease) or
the last follow-up examination. Survival curves for each
polymorphism were drawn by the Kaplan-Meier method
and statistical significance was determined by the log-rank
test. The genotype status of the polymorphisms that were
significantly associated with adverse survival was defined
as “risk genotype”.
Toxicity assessment was performed for each
chemotherapy cycle and included incidence evaluation
of grade 4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, red blood
cell and platelet transfusion (as a consequence of the
hematological toxicity), fever, nausea and vomiting,
stomatitis, grade 4 transaminases (hepatotoxicity), nephroand neurotoxicity.
Polymorphisms significantly associated with
adverse events in univariate analyses were also analyzed
by Cox proportional hazards or multiple logistic regression
analyses. Since this was an exploratory study, no multiple
testing correction was applied, considering p values and
CIs more informative for the interpretation of our data.
All statistical analyses were carried out by using
the StatView 5.0.1 software. Power calculations with real
input data obtained from the survival and toxicity cohorts
and a type I error probability of 0.05 were performed using
the freely available Power and Sample size program [33].
