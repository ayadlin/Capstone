Summary

Author Manuscript

The feasibility of performing broad and deep tumour genome sequencing has shed new light into
tumour heterogeneity and provided important insights into the evolution of metastases arising
from different clones1,2. To add an additional layer of complexity, tumour evolution may be
influenced by selective pressure provided by therapy, in a similar fashion as it occurs in infectious
diseases. Here, we have studied the tumour genomic evolution in a patient with metastatic breast
cancer bearing an activating PIK3CA mutation. The patient was treated with the PI3Kα inhibitor
BYL719 and achieved a lasting clinical response, although eventually progressed to treatment and
died shortly thereafter. A rapid autopsy was performed and a total of 14 metastatic sites were
collected and sequenced. All metastatic lesions, when compared to the pre-treatment tumour, had
a copy loss of PTEN, and those lesions that became refractory to BYL719 had additional and
different PTEN genetic alterations, resulting in the loss of PTEN expression. Acquired bi-allelic
loss of PTEN was found in one additional patient treated with BYL719 whereas in two patients
PIK3CA mutations present in the primary tumour were no longer detected at the time of
progression. To functionally characterize our findings, inducible PTEN knockdown in sensitive
cells resulted in resistance to BYL719, while simultaneous PI3Kp110β blockade reverted this
resistance phenotype, both in cell lines and in PTEN-null xenografts derived from our patient. We
conclude that parallel genetic evolution of separate sites with different PTEN genomic alterations
leads to a convergent PTEN- null phenotype resistant to PI3Kα inhibition.

Author Manuscript

We are currently engaged in testing the antitumour activity of a novel PI3Kα inhibitor,
BYL719, in patients with tumours harbouring activating PI3K p110α mutations3. The PI3K
pathway is essential for cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism4,5. The PI3K
family of enzymes is divided into three main classes (I to III), with class I being the most
often implicated in human cancer6. Class IA PI3K is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic
subunit (p110α, β, or δ) and a regulatory subunit 7,8. PIK3CA, the gene encoding p110α, is
mutated in up to 40% of oestrogen receptor (ER) and/or HER2 positive breast tumours9,10.
In our ongoing phase I clinical study of BYL719 we have observed clinical responses in
breast, head and neck, and other tumours3, providing proof of principle that PI3Kα targeting
is active against tumours harbouring PIK3CA mutation.

Author Manuscript

We are presenting the case of a 60-year-old breast cancer patient diagnosed with invasive
ductal carcinoma that underwent surgery followed by adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy
and the aromatase inhibitor examestane. Four years later, the patient developed bone
metastases and started therapy with the oestrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant, achieving
stable disease. After eighteen months on therapy, her disease progressed in the liver, bone
and lymph nodes. The archival tissue of the primary tumour was subjected to PCR-based
genetic analysis11 and a hot spot mutation in PIK3CA (E542K) was detected. This finding
led to the patient's enrolment in a phase I clinical trial of BYL719 (NCT01219699). The
patient rapidly achieved a confirmed partial response according to the RECIST 1.0 criteria12

that lasted 9.5 months (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). At that point, while the tumour
remained stable in multiple sites including a peri-aortic lymph node location, progression
occurred in the lungs (Fig. 1) and consequently therapy with BYL719 was discontinued. The
clinical status of the patient deteriorated rapidly and she died two months after termination
of the BYL719 treatment.
A rapid autopsy was performed three hours after death and a total of 14 metastases with
tumour cells present were identified and collected for sequencing (Extended Data Table 1).

Author Manuscript

In order to proceed systematically to identify possible genetic determinants of acquired
resistance to PI3K p110α inhibition, we took a three-step approach. First, we examined both
the primary tumour (before BYL719 treatment) and the new lung metastasis by whole
genome sequencing. Although both samples shared many somatic genetic aberrations (Fig.
2a and Extended Data Fig. 2), only a PTEN copy number loss was detected in the lung
metastasis (Fig 2b). Then, we analysed the primary tumour, lung metastasis, and the periaortic lesion that remained stable (responding) at the time of progression to BYL719 therapy
by whole exome sequencing (Fig. 2c). This analysis revealed that both peri-aortic and lung
lesions harboured mutations in PIK3CA, ESR1, and BRCA2, and single copy loss of PTEN.
Importantly, in addition to the PTEN copy number loss, we identified a PTEN del339FS
mutation only in the lung metastasis (Fig. 2c). By immunohistochemistry (IHC), we
observed that PTEN protein expression was lost in the lung metastasis but was present in
both the primary tumour and periaortic lesion (Fig. 2d).

Finally, to confirm and expand our findings, we sequenced the primary tumour and all the
metastatic lesions to >500-fold coverage using a custom targeted deep-sequencing assay,
MSK-IMPACT13,14. A number of mutations were shared by the primary tumour and the
metastatic sites whereas others were observed only in all or in selected metastatic lesions
(Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table). We confirmed that the PIK3CA E542K mutation in the
primary tumour was conserved in the metastatic samples and detected the presence of
another PIK3CA mutation (D725G). Moreover, we found increased copy number of FGFR1
and EI4EBP1 in all tumour samples, consistent with the relatively frequent 8p11-12
amplification described in breast cancer15,16. ESR1 Y537N and BRCA2 L971S alterations
were present in all the metastatic lesions but not in the primary tumour. We speculate that
the ESR1 Y537N mutation, reported to promote ligand-independent ER activation13, was
selected upon anti-oestrogen therapy received by the patient prior to BYL719 treatment.
Central to our work, all metastatic lesions appeared to harbour a single copy loss of PTEN
(Extended Data Fig. 3). Furthermore, we found that 10 of 14 metastatic lesions harboured
additional genomic alterations within PTEN. The spectrum of PTEN alterations was
heterogeneous across the 10 samples and included a splice site mutation at K342, a
frameshift indel at P339 (confirming the WES result), and 4 different exon-level deletions
(Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4). All 10 specimens with either secondary PTEN mutations
or copy number loss were confirmed negative for PTEN staining by IHC whereas the four
specimens that retained a PTEN WT allele were positive for PTEN protein expression
(Extended Data Fig. 5). In addition, for those lesions that were visualized by CT scan, there
was a tight correlation between progression of disease and loss of PTEN expression. The
peri-aortic lesion (M02) that was responding at the time of disease progression still

contained one PTEN WT allele and protein expression. On the contrary, the lung lesions
(M04, M06, M09, and M11) and liver lesion (M12) with documented progression to therapy
had bi-allelic PTEN alteration and lack of expression.
In an effort to integrate the genomic data from our patient, we constructed a dendrogram
mapping the phylogenetic evolution of the disease. Our findings suggest that all the lesions
were derived from the PTEN WT primary tumour and that there was a progressive and
parallel loss of PTEN under BYL719 selective pressure (Fig. 3b). Of note, the two-month
duration between progression to BYL719 and autopsy needs to be considered as well.

Author Manuscript

In order to expand our observations, we analysed paired samples (pre-treatment and at
progression) from six additional patients enrolled in the same study at our institution (Table
1). Targeted exome sequencing identified homozygous loss of PTEN in a post-treatment
sample of a breast cancer patient who developed resistance to BYL719 after initially
experiencing a durable response to therapy (Table 1). We also confirmed lack of PTEN
expression by IHC in the post-treatment sample (Extended Data Fig. 6). We found no
detectable PIK3CA mutations in the post-treatment samples of two patients (Table 1). Given
that the presence of PIK3CA mutations drove sensitivity to BYL719 in our cell line
screens17, positive selection of clones bearing wild-type alleles of PIK3CA may explain the
emergence of resistance to BYL719 in these two additional cases. These results may be an
indication that in some cases PIK3CA mutations are not early founder/truncal events but
branched subclonal drivers that are cleared from the tumours under the selective pressure of
PI3Kα inhibition. In any case, the fact that loss of PTEN expression and emergence of
PIK3CA WT clones are mutually exclusive in our patient samples indicates that both events
may be important in opposing the therapeutic efficacy of BYL719.

Author Manuscript

No other alterations with an obvious connection to BYL719 resistance were found in the
responding cases, with the exception of a mutation (E1490*) and an in-frame deletion in
MAP3K1in one of the three patients for which neither PTEN nor PIK3CA status changed
during BYL719 treatment. Further characterization is needed to determine whether these
mutations lead to increased MEK and ERK signaling and limit the effects of PI3K
inhibition.

Author Manuscript

PTEN encodes for a phosphatase that regulates the activity of PI3K by limiting the
accumulation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a required mediator to
initiate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling cascade18. In the absence of PTEN, cancer cells
become dependent mostly on the activity of the p110β isoform of PI3K to propagate
signalling through downstream pathway effectors19,20. In an attempt to explain this, we
hypothesized that progressive decrease or loss of PTEN expression in the presence of PI3K
p110α inhibition might restore PI3K/AKT signalling through PI3K p110β activity. To test
our hypothesis, we established cell lines expressing either doxycycline-inducible or
constitutive shRNA against PTEN mRNA in T47D and MCF7 cells, known to be
intrinsically sensitive to BYL71921. As expected, induction of PTEN downregulation led to
activation of AKT and the downstream effectors PRAS40, GSK3β and S6 in both T47D
(Fig. 4a) and MCF7 (data not shown) cells under basal conditions. PTEN downregulation
markedly limited the effects of BYL719, both at the signalling and cell viability level. On

the other hand, PTEN knockdown did not result in resistance to the pan-PI3K inhibitor
BKM120, which blocks all the PI3K p110 isoforms (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7a).
Similar effects were observed in another BYL719-sensitive cell line (MDA-MB-453) with
constitutive PTEN knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Author Manuscript

From our patient's non-responding PTEN-null lung metastatic lesion, we were able to
establish xenografts in nude mice. Consistent with the in vitro data, this patient-derived
xenograft was resistant to BYL719 treatment but sensitive to BKM120 (Fig. 4c). The degree
of inhibition of phospho-AKT and phospho-S6 was also higher with BKM120 (Fig. 4d and
Extended Data Fig. 7c and d). These results were complemented by the combination of
BYL719 and the PI3K p110β inhibitor AZD6482. Upon PTEN knockdown, only combined
p110α and β blockade was capable of reverting the resistant phenotype (Fig. 4e and
Extended Data Fig 8a). Similarly, the BYL719-resistant patient derived xenograft was
insensitive to AZD6482 alone but responded to the combination of both compounds (Fig.
4f). Profound inhibition of AKT and S6 phosphorylation was achieved only upon treatment
with BYL719 in combination with AZD6482 (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 8b and c).
Taken together, these data indicate that inhibition of the p110β isoform is required to
achieve antitumour activity in cells/tumours that lost PTEN expression and become resistant
to BYL719.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we report a case of parallel genetic evolution under selective therapeutic
pressure leading to a progressive loss of PTEN expression and consequent gain of
dependency on the PI3K p110β isoform. Parallel evolution under selective pressure has been
described in conditions where treatments are highly efficacious such as in HIV22. Our case
highlights that this tumour, despite its heterogeneity, was dependent on PI3K signalling
probably as a result of the presence of the same activating PIK3CA mutation in all the
tumour sites. Upon continued suppression of PI3Kα, diverse genomic alterations emerged,
leading to PTEN loss as an alternate mechanism of PI3K activation. Moreover, our study
emphasises the importance of tumour interrogation upon progression to therapy and the
dynamic nature of tumour genomes under selective therapeutic pressure.

Cell viability was assessed using the tetrazolium-based MTT assay after 6 days of treatment.
All cell lines resulted negative for mycoplasma contamination. Western blotting was carried
out using previously described methods21. All the in vitro experiments were performed in
triplicate.
Patient-derived xenografts and IHC—Animals were maintained and treated in
accordance with Institutional Guidelines of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(Protocol number 12-10-019). Tumours were implanted subcutaneously in six-week-old
female athymic NU/NU nude mice. Once the tumours reached a volume of ∼200 mm3, it
was expanded in multiple mice which were then randomized to the following treatments:
BYL719, BKM120 (a pan-class I PI3K inhibitor), or AZD6482 (a PI3Kβ inhibitor), each
administered orally at 25 mg/kg once a day. After treatment, mice were euthanized and
tumours were harvested and procured for IHC analysis. IHC was performed on a Ventana
Discovery XT processor platform using standard protocols and the following antibodies:

Whole genome and whole exome sequencing—For whole genome (WG) and whole
exome (WE) sequencing, DNA was derived from the primary tumour, lung metastasis, and
peri-aortic lymph node metastasis. DNA from the spleen was used as a normal control. WG
libraries were produced as previously described23 and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq
2500 platform as paired-end 100 base pair reads, producing ∼30-fold (primary tumour,
spleen normal)-50-fold (lung metastasis) coverage for WG sequencing. By hybrid capture
(Nimblegen version 3.0) of the lymph node and lung metastases, primary tumour and spleen
normal, we generated ∼100-fold coverage for WE sequencing.
All patients provided written informed consent for the genetic research studies performed in
accordance with protocols approved by Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional
Review Board. Autopsy in the index patient was performed within the first three hours post
mortem.

Targeted exome sequencing (MSK-IMPACT)—DNA derived from the primary
tumour, 14 metastases, and matched normal spleen tissue was further subjected to deepcoverage targeted sequencing of key cancer-associated genes. Our assay, termed MSKIMPACT (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets), involves
hybridization of barcoded libraries to custom oligonucleotides (Nimblegen SeqCap)
designed to capture all protein-coding exons and select introns of 279 commonly implicated
oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, and members of pathways deemed actionable by
targeted therapies14. The captured pool was subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq
2500 as pairedend 75-base pair reads, producing 513-fold coverage per tumour. Sequence
data were analysed to identify three classes of somatic alterations: single-nucleotide
variants, small insertions/deletions (indels), and copy number alterations.
Barcoded sequence libraries were prepared using 250 ng genomic DNA (Kapa Biosystems)
and combined in a single equimolar pool. Sequence data were demutliplexed using
CASAVA, and reads were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19) using BWA and
postprocessed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) according to GATK best
practices24,25.
MuTect and GATK were used to call single-nucleotide variants and small indels,
respectively26. Exon-level copy number gains and losses were inferred from the ratio in
Tumour:Normal sequence coverage for each target region, following a loess-normalization
to adjust for the dependency of coverage on GC content27. DNA sequences are deposited in
