Abstract
Small-molecule inhibitors of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins are being tested in clinical
trials for a variety of cancers, but patient selection strategies
remain limited. This challenge is partly attributed to the heterogeneous responses elicited by BET inhibition (BETi), including cellular differentiation, senescence, and death. In this study,
we performed phenotypic and gene-expression analyses of
treatment-naive and engineered tolerant cell lines representing
human melanoma and leukemia to elucidate the dominant
features deﬁning response to BETi. We found that de novo and

acquired tolerance to BETi is driven by the robustness of the
apoptotic response, and that genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of the apoptotic signaling network can modify the
phenotypic response to BETi. We further reveal that the expression signatures of the apoptotic genes BCL2, BCL2L1, and BAD
signiﬁcantly predict response to BETi. Taken together, our
ﬁndings highlight the apoptotic program as a determinant
of response to BETi, and provide a molecular basis for
patient stratiﬁcation and combination therapy development.

The development and progression of tumors is driven by
altered transcriptional programs and underlying tumor-speciﬁc
chromatin states. BET proteins are highly enriched and functionally essential at gene control elements that drive the expression of
critical oncogenes such as MYC (1). As such, BET inhibition affects
many pathways critical for cancer cell growth, leading to broad
efﬁcacy in pre-clinical disease models (2–5). However, at the
molecular and phenotypic level, response to BETi can be quite
heterogeneous, making it unclear what the critical drivers are for
deﬁning patient stratiﬁcation strategies. A deeper understanding
of the pathways responsible for maximal response to BET inhibition will, therefore, reﬁne these strategies and allow for effective
patient selection.

Generation of BETi-tolerant cell lines
A375 cells (ATCC) were cultured in 1 mmol/L CPI203 for
approximately 90 days. NOMO-1 cells (DSMZ) were cultured
with CPI203 (increasing concentrations) for approximately 9
months. Live cells were periodically enriched by centrifugation
over Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare). Following selection, cells were
maintained in 1 mmol/L CPI203. Parental and BETi-tolerant cells
were authenticated using SNP genotyping with RNA-sequencing
data (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).
Analysis of gene expression in BETi-sensitive and -insensitive
cell lines
Cells were treated with CPI203 (3–4 days) and viability was
assessed [CellTiter Glo (Promega) or resazurin (Sigma)]. Expression values were obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(6). For qRT-PCR, DCt values for BCL2 and BCL2L1 were obtained
by subtracting Ct PPIB from Ct BCL2 or BCL2L1. DDCt values were

Long-term culture of A375 (melanoma) and NOMO-1 (acute
myelogenous leukemia) in the BET inhibitor CPI203 generated
cells that could proliferate in either CPI203 or the distinct BET

A375-t2, revealed a modest shift in the GI50 values for BETi
(Fig. 1A, left; Supplementary Fig. S1A and Supplementary Fig.
S1C, left). BETi-tolerant NOMO-1-t cells proliferated at concentrations of BETi approximately 30-fold higher than their
original GI50 concentrations (Fig. 1A, right; and Supplementary
Fig. S1C, right) and surprisingly grew best in the presence of
CPI203. Both BETi-tolerant cell lines A375-t1 and NOMO-1-t
displayed a blunted apoptotic response to BETi relative to
parental cells (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1D).
Notably, A375-t1 and NOMO-1-t were equally or more sensitive than parental cells to both cytarabine and doxorubicin,
which suggests that they are not resistant to all apoptosisinducing agents and points toward the use of BETi in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapies (Supplementary Fig.
S1E–S1F).
Consistent with these phenotypes, through gene-expression
proﬁling we observed increased expression of the BCL2 family
member BCL2L1 (encoding BCL2L1, formerly known as BCL-xL)
in both A375-t and NOMO-1-t compared with parental cells

www.aacrjournals.org

treated with CPI203 (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C). In
BETi-treated NOMO-1-t cells, BCL2 was also upregulated compared with BETi-treated parental cells (Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Fig. S2C). MCL1 and BCL2A1 were reduced in both tolerant A375
and NOMO-1 cells, highlighting the selective alteration of speciﬁc
BCL2 family members. In contrast with recent work pointing to
the Wnt pathway as a determinant of response to BETi (9, 10), we
did not observe increased expression of Wnt target genes in either
A375 or NOMO-1 BETi resistance models.
BCL2L1 and BCL2 are critical mediators of BETi sensitivity and
resistance
Given the expression changes noted above, we focused on
the functional roles of BCL2L1 in A375-t1 and NOMO-1-t
cells, and BCL2 in NOMO-1-t cells given that BCL2 was
expressed at very low levels in A375-t1 (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Knockdown of BCL2L1 in A375-t1 cells, and of
BCL2 or BCL2L1 in NOMO-1-t cells, led to dramatically
reduced proliferation and signiﬁcantly increased apoptosis in

the presence of CPI203 (Fig. 2A and B and Supplementary Fig.
S3B–S3C). In addition, overexpression of BCL2L1 in parental
A375 cells resulted in a blunted apoptotic response to BETi
(Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Treatment of A375-t1 and NOMO-1-t with ABT-737, an inhibitor of BCL2, BCL2L1, and BCL2L2 (11), concurrently with
CPI203 led to growth suppression and induction of apoptosis,
while affecting parental cells to a lesser extent (Fig. 2C and D;
Supplementary Fig. S3D–S3E). Consistent with their sustained
expression of BCL2, NOMO-1-t cells also showed growth inhibition with the BCL2-speciﬁc inhibitor, ABT-199 (Supplementary
Fig. S3F; ref. 12). In both models, the degree of apoptosis induction in tolerant cells cotreated with CPI203 and ABT-737 was
comparable with parental cells treated with BETi alone, suggesting
that pharmacologic inhibition of BCL2 family members can
abrogate tolerance to BETi. Notably, combination of the BET
inhibitor JQ1 with ABT-199 showed synergistic effects on growth
inhibition (13), highlighting the potential of combining BETi
with BH3 peptidomimetics.

Engagement of the apoptotic program is associated with robust
phenotypic response to BET inhibition
Next, we tested whether the apoptotic program correlates with
de novo sensitivity to BET inhibitors by proﬁling 51 hematologic
cell lines that we termed "sensitive" or "insensitive" based on a
GI50 cutoff value of 0.25 mmol/L CPI203. As shown in Fig. 3A, the
magnitude of apoptosis, but not the cytostatic response, is highly
correlated with sensitivity to BET inhibition. This is consistent
with previous work showing that the induction of apoptosis is
often associated with preclinical efﬁcacy (2, 3, 5, 14–16).
Given that BETi regulates the expression of antiapoptotic
factors like BCL2 (2), we tested whether apoptosis is associated
with a change in the expression of key anti- and proapoptotic
factors after CPI203 treatment. A clear trend toward downregulation of antiapoptotic factors and upregulation of proapoptotic
factors was observed in cell lines that undergo apoptosis (Fig. 3B,
top), and a more robust transcriptional response is signiﬁcantly
correlated with the magnitude of the apoptotic response to
CPI203 (Fig. 3B, bottom). To functionally test whether these

changes in gene expression were associated with increased apoptotic signaling, we used BH3 proﬁling with the BIM BH3 peptide
to assess mitochondrial "priming" (7, 17). In two cell lines that
show a robust apoptotic response to BET inhibition (MV411 and
Kasumi-1), preincubation with CPI203 induced measurable
increases in mitochondrial priming, which was not observed in

SUDHL5; Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S4A).
The results reported above suggest that in highly sensitive cells,
BETi treatment disproportionately modulates apoptotic signaling
by altering the expression of anti- and proapoptotic genes. Whether these changes in gene expression are the direct result of release

of BET family proteins from chromatin is not clear. Recent work
has reported that highly BRD4-occupied gene control elements
deﬁne loci that are highly BET dependent, which includes BCL2
family genes (1). However, we have found that high BRD4
occupancy and release upon BETi treatment are not universal
predictors of downregulation of any given gene (data not shown).
It is likely that identiﬁcation of predictive features of BET transcriptional regulation will facilitate our ability to forecast a robust
apoptotic response to BET inhibition.
Basal expression levels of BCL2, BCL2L1, and BAD serve as
predictive biomarkers for BETi treatment
Given our functional data, we tested whether the baseline
mRNA expression level of apoptotic factors (Supplementary Table
S1) could predict phenotypic response to BETi in a panel of 245
cell lines (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Information).
We found that ﬁve genes, BCL2, BCL2L2, BCL2L1, BAD, and
BCLAF1, were differentially expressed with high signiﬁcance, with
BCL2 being the most differentially expressed gene (Supplementary Table S1, Fig. 4A). We reasoned that BETi may selectively
target cells that are dependent on BCL2, and tested for BCL2
dependence in a subset of cell lines using mitochondrial exposure
to the BAD BH3 peptide (18). We observed that mitochondrial
depolarization in response to BAD peptide is correlated with the
expression of BCL2 in a set of 6 cell lines (Fig. 4B, top), consistent
with published data (18), and that the degree of mitochondrial
depolarization was inversely correlated with the GI50 of BETi (Fig.
4B, bottom). There was no signiﬁcant mitochondrial depolarization in response to the HRK BH3 peptide, arguing against any
contribution of BCL2L1 to the BAD depolarization response
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). As both inhibitors seem to preferentially target cell lines that are dependent on BCL2 for survival, we
noted that the GI50 values of CPI203 and ABT-199 are signiﬁcantly
correlated (Supplementary Fig. S4C; ref. 12).
We next tested whether the expression levels of these apoptotic
mediators could predict a robust response to BET inhibition.
Selection based on the expression of a one or two genes significantly increased the response rate, with selection of cells with
high BCL2 expression and low expression of either BCL2L1 or
BAD improving the response rate to 65% or 75%, respectively
(Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S5A). Importantly, selection
based on these factors was not merely enriching for cell lines of
hematologic origin, as these selection criteria increased the
response rate of isolated hematologic or solid tumor cell lines,
and of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S5B–S5D). We also noted that selection based on these

biomarkers selected for the most sensitive tumor subtypes, which
may point to indications beyond hematologic malignancies that
will beneﬁt from BETi (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Finally, the
enrichment of phenotypically sensitive cell lines was observed
when gene expression was measured by qRT-PCR or Western
blotting (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S6), indicating that these
criteria may be used with clinically relevant methods.
Although they have tremendous promise, BET inhibitors also
bring new challenges for selecting patient populations and for
determining optimal drug combinations. This work identiﬁes
the apoptotic signaling network and the expression of factors
such as BCL2, BCL2L1, and BAD as patient selection biomarkers
that will help BET inhibitors to reach their full therapeutic
potential.
