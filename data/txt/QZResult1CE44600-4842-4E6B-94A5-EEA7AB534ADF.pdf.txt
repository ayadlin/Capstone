ABSTRACT
Purpose: Patients with distantly metastatic (M1) penile squamous carcinoma
have extremely poor prognosis and few prospective clinical trials evaluating systemic
treatment have ever been performed for this population.
Methods: Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with histologically confirmed, distantly
metastatic, measurable penile squamous carcinoma were enrolled. They were treated
with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (day1), cisplatin 70 mg/m2 (day1), and fluorouracil 500 mg/
m2/d (days 1 to 5) every 3 weeks as first line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint
was objective response rate (ORR).
Results: 39 patients received chemotherapy with a median of four cycles (range two
to six). The median follow-up time was 11 months. 15 patients had a confirmed objective
response (38.5%, 95% CI 23.36–55.38), all of which were partial responses. The median
progression-free survival (PFS) was 3 months (95% CI 2.92–3.09), and the median
overall survival (OS) was 7 months (95% CI 5.99–8.03). Toxicity was manageable and
the most frequently recorded adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (13
of 39; 33%), nausea/vomiting (7 of 39;18%). There was no treatment-related death.
Conclusion: The palliative regimen of docetaxel, fluorouracil, and cisplatin
induced moderate responses and can be used as a choice for the treatment of patients
with distantly metastatic penile cancer. However, efforts to improve efficacy and
minimize toxicity for this regimen should be made in the future.

penile cancer might be also substantially different. More
patients with penile cancer at early stage in developed
world were diagnosed and treated compared with those
in developing countries [2–4]. It has been reported that
the higher incidence and later stage of penile cancer in
developing countries were possibly related to poor penile
hygiene, more smoking habit, absence of circumcision,
suboptimal availability of medical care, and other
socioeconomic factors [5–7].
The rarity of penile cancer in developed countries
made the conduct of prospective clinical trials on which
to build clinical treatment was scarce. Particularly, the
already limited trials for late stage penile cancer mainly
recruited heterogeneous populations of patients with
different prognoses in order to accrue sufficient number of

INTRODUCTION
Penile squamous cell carcinoma is a rare cancer
in developed countries. In 2013, 1,570 new cases and
310 deaths from penile cancers were predicted to occur
in the United States [1]. However, it is a serious health
problem in developing countries. It can constitute up to
10% of malignant diseases in men in some African and
South American countries, and this rate is 6% in some
parts of India. In fact, penile cancer is the most commonly
diagnosed cancer in some developing countries such as
Uganda [2]. Worldwide, an estimated more than 26,000
new cases are diagnosed annually [1].
In addition to difference in overall incidence bet­
ween developed and developing countries, the stage of

patients [3, 8]. For example, in AJCC staging system, stage
IV penile cancer comprises T4, or N3, or M1 patients.
The incidence of distant metastases (M1) has been 1%–
10% at the initial presentation or disease recurrence [4,
9, 10]. For the locally advanced T4 or N3 patients, it
has been demonstrated that a significant proportion of
patients could enjoy long disease free survival if they
received neoadjuvant therapy and subsequent curative
surgery. Overall survival (OS) for this population could
be longer than two years [11–14]. However, for the M1
patients with distant metastases, palliative chemotherapy
is the only effective treatment modality, and the prognosis
for this population is extremely poor. It was reported in
literature that the penile cancer patients at M1 stage only
have overall survival of several months [4, 9]. Clearly the
locally advanced T4 or N3 patients and distantly metastatic
M1 patients require different treatment evaluations.
However, previous studies usually combined T4, N3 and
M1 patients with penile cancer for accrual purpose. This
demonstrates an unmet medical need for this group of
patients with extremely poor prognosis.
Recently, the combination of docetaxel, cisplatin
and fluorouracil has shown high activity in head and
neck squamous cancer and other cancer treatments which
showed histopathologic similarity to penile squamous
cancer [15, 16]. It was also shown that this combination
chemotherapy was active in a few late stage penile patients
in retrospective analysis [17]. In this study, we evaluated the
efficacy and safety of a similar regimen in the treatment of
M1 stage penile cancer in terms of conventional response
rate, progression-free survival (PFS), OS, and toxicity.

progressive disease (44%), adverse events (18%) and
patient’s decision not to receive further treatment (18%).
Dose reductions occurred in 21% patients. Gastrointestinal
toxicities were the most common adverse events leading
to cycle delay.
The median follow-up time was 11 months. Of
the 39 evaluable patients, no patients had a CR, and
15 patients had a confirmed PR, resulting in an overall
response of 38.5% (95% CI 23.36–55.38). Another 14
patients showed stable disease as best response (35.9%).
Thus disease control (CR plus PR plus SD) was noted in
30 (74.4%) patients (Table 2).
At time for this analysis (January, 2015), all patients
had progressive disease and 38 had died. Using the
Kaplan-Meier method, median actuarial progression-free
survival in all patients was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.92–3.09;
Figure 1A). 3-month progression-free survival was 28.2%
(95% CI 15.26–42.65); 6-month progression-free survival
was 2.56% (95% CI 0.20–11.53). Median actuarial overall
survival in all patients was 7 months (95% CI 5.99–8.03;
Figure 1B). 6-month overall survival was 56.41% (95%
CI 70.22–39.57).

Adverse events
All 39 patients were assessable for toxicity
(Table 3). 16 patients (41%) experienced one or more
grade 3 or 4 toxicity during treatment (95% CI 25.6% to
57.9%). The most common single grade 3 or 4 toxicity
was neutropenia (13 patients; 33%). Febrile neutropenia
was experienced by 3 patients (7.7%). Other frequent
grade 3 or 4 toxicities were nausea/vomiting (7 patients;
18%); neuropathy sensor (6 patients; 15.4%). There were
no treatment-related deaths. In general, the toxicities were
manageable through dose reduction, dose interruption, or
supportive medical treatment.
The effect of possible prognostic variables (baseline
hemoglobin, ECOG performance status, albumin, presence
of visceral metastasis) were examined in a univariate
analysis. In the multivariable model, ECOG performance
status of greater than 0, and presence of visceral metastasis
were shown to significantly affect overall survival
(Table 4). Hemoglobin and albumin level did not affect
overall survival.

RESULTS
Patients
Between November 2009 and July 2013, 39 patients
with distantly metastatic penile cancer (M1 stage) were
enrolled in our center in the study. All patients were
assessed for efficacy and safety. The patients characteristics
were listed in Table 1. The median patient age was 59 years
(range from 34 to 75 years), and the distant metastases were
mostly in the lung (30.8%), lymph nodes (38.5%), and the
liver (25.6%). 61.5% patients had ECOG performance
status 1.28% patients were included in this study to receive
primary treatment for penile cancer. 64.2% patients received
surgeries and recurred at the time of enrollment. Because
the role of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgeries of penile
cancer was not established, adjuvant chemotherapy was not
recommended for these patients in our center. The patients
enrolled in this study were chemotherapy naive.

DISCUSSION
Patients with distantly metastatic penile cancer are
administered with chemotherapy as palliative therapy
to control symptoms and prolong survival. Given that
the management of metastatic penile cancer remains a
formidable challenge, a clear need remains for systemic
therapies for these patients, especially for those with good
PS. This is the first prospective study that we know of
with sufficient size to reliably estimate the outcomes of
palliative chemotherapy for M1 penile carcinoma.

Efficacy
Overall mean relative dose intensity was 91%.
Median number of chemotherapy was 4 cycles (range:
2–6). The most frequent reasons for discontinuation were

The TPF regimen had 38.5% objective response
rate in 39 distantly metastatic penile cancer patients. Our
results seem to be consistent with those of several other
phase II studies in the advanced penile cancer setting [12,
19, 20]. A phase II study using similar regimen showed
similar objective response rate. The major limitation
in this study, as discussed by the authors, was that both
patients with metastatic and locally advanced disease
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

were included [20]. This facilitated a trial with efficient
accrual but precluded examination with any subtlety of
the differing requirements for palliative and neoadjuvant
treatment. The clear requirement for the latter is a
sufficiently high-response rate to allow for downstage;
to reduce tumor size for improving the outcomes of
resection and to eliminate microscopic distant metastases.
While the purpose of palliative chemotherapy is to relieve

symptoms and prolong survival. In this study using similar
regimen to our trial, the authors reported considerable and
troublesome toxicity: more than 20% patients experienced
grade 3 or higher febrile neutropenia and diarrhea was
prevalent in the patients. However, in our trial, these
toxicities were moderate and manageable. Grade 3 or
higher febrile neutropenia and diarrhea were only 7.7%
and 5.2%, respectively. One reason for the difference
might be the requirement of prophylactic growth
factor support in our study. In addition, in the study by
Nicholsons et al [20], patients with ECOG performance
status 2 were also recruited. However, in our study, only
ECOG performance status 0 to 1 were allowed. So the
different general conditions of patients may also partially
account for different toxicity profile. More importantly, we
used lower dose of fluorouracil (500 mg/m2/d) compared
with that in Nicholson’s study. When fluorouracil 750
mg/m2/d in TPF regimen was used previously in other
cancer treatments, gastrointestinal toxicities were the most
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

common adverse events leading to dose reduction [15, 16].
And fluorouracil dose was most commonly reduced [16].
Because M1 stage penile cancer patients were more fragile
compared with the locally advanced head and neck cancer
patients for whom TPF was frequently given (the OS for
the latter can be over 2 years.), lower dose of fluorouracil
at 500 mg/m2 was given in our trial. This might be also a
reason for the better tolerability in our trial.
Previously, there were several other phase II
studies for advanced penile cancer treatments [3, 21]. The
southwestern oncology group study of single-agent cisplatin
was the largest phase II chemotherapy trial at that time, with
26 patients evaluable for response. All but 1 patient had stage
IV disease, and none had undergone previous chemotherapy.
An overall response rate of 15% was achieved. And the
median overall survival time was 4.7 months [22].
In the largest published prospective study on
advanced penile carcinoma, Haas et al. administered
the BMP regimen in 40 evaluable patients with locally
32216

advanced or metastatic disease, with a response rate of
32%. However, grade 4 or 5 toxicity occurred in 28% of
patients, which precluded general adoption of this regimen
[23]. Retrospective data by Hakenberg et al confirmed the
unacceptable toxicity profile of such a regimen [24].
The irinotecan/cisplatin study conducted by the
European organization for research and treatment of cancer
was prospective with 26 evaluable patients. However, the
results were interpreted as negative by the investigators
because the response rate had an 80% confidence interval
that extended well below 30% [19].
The recent study by Pagliaro LC et al evaluated TIP
as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced penile
cancer. An ORR of 50% was achieved and this regimen
was also recommended for M1 stage penile cancer
treatment [14]. However, generalizing such a neoadjuvant
regimen to palliative setting would be unreliable. Thus,
currently there is no standard chemotherapy regimen in
the treatment of M1 penile cancer. The moderate ORR of
TPF regimen showed here, together with the manageable
toxicities and no treatment-related death, suggests this
regimen could be a choice for these patients. The median
OS of 7 months demonstrated the efficacy of this regimen
is far from perfection and more effective combinations
should be explored.
Understanding prognostic factors in M1 stage
penile cancer receiving systemic chemotherapy may
better define the population under study, facilitate future
design of clinical trials, and help individualize patient
treatment. Both the poor performance status and visceral
metastases were shown to be independent negative
prognostic factors in some malignancies [25]. A recent
retrospective analysis of individual patient data of
advanced penile cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy
identified that visceral metastases and poor performance
status were poor prognostic factors [26]. Our results were
consistent with these results. Hemoglobin and albumin
were not significant in multivariable analyses. These
factors may be more relevant in localized small tumors
undergoing curative surgery and not in patients with
distant metastases.
The clinical efficacy noted might have been
subject to the common biases noted in the phase II
studies, such as selection bias, especially in the context
of its small sample size. Thus the results should be
interpreted with caution. Challenges facing studies
in penile cancer include the time needed to accrue
sufficient numbers of patients for a rare disease. Another
recent trial of similar size in this disease took over 8
years to recruit 30 patients for neoadjuvant therapy [14].
In our trial, it took us less than 4 years for accruing 39
patients although M1 patients only comprise a minority
in the overall patient population of penile cancer. As the
largest cancer center in China, some of enrolled patients
were referred to us from various local hospitals. The
successful conduct of this trial showed that for this rare
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

disease, accrual would not be an impossible barrier for
clinical trials of penile cancer in developing countries.
More input of health care resources from government
and industry was necessary to facilitate this process and
initiate further clinical studies.
In summary, the results obtained with this regimen are
promising in terms of both efficacy and toxicity, especially in
view of the very limited therapeutic options available for these
patients. This regimen could be a choice for such patients and
should be further confirmed in randomized clinical trials. In
order to further prolong survival for this patient population,
better understanding of tumor biology and study of novel
combinations of biologic agents were warranted.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
The study reported herein was a single-institution,
open-label phase II trial that accrued patients in the
Department of Internal Medicine in Shanghai Cancer
Hospital, Fudan University, China. The clinical trial was
registered in UMIN-CTR (UMIN000002697). The study
was approved by the institutional review board, and
patients were required to provide signed informed consent.

Eligibility
Patients aged 18 to 75 years with histologically
proven squamous carcinoma of the penis were required
to have measurable disease as defined by the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) [18].
Patients were required to be at stage M1 (distant metastases)
according to 2002 TNM staging system of the American
Joint Committee on Cancer with any T or any N stage.
Other main eligibility criteria included glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) of 60 ml/min or greater, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status 0 to 1; life expectancy of 3 months or longer;
absence of brain metastases; and adequate hepatic, and
hematologic functions: absolute neutrophil count of
1.5 × 109/L or more; platelet count greater than 100 × 109/L;
hemoglobin greater than 90 g/L; total bilirubin up to one
and a half times the upper limit of normal; serum aspartate
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase up to three
times the upper limit of normal, or up to five times the
upper limit of normal when liver metastases present.
Exclusion criteria included non-squamous cancer
of the penis, primary squamous carcinoma of the urethra,
previous chemotherapy in metastatic or adjuvant/
neoadjuvant setting, and prior malignancy (other than
squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma of nonpenile skin) in the previous 5 years. Patients were also
excluded if they had uncontrolled infection; class II or higher
congestive heart failure; pre-existing peripheral neuropathy
of grade 1 or higher according to National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE) version 3 or ototoxicity of grade 1 or higher.

Procedures

hemoglobin (≥100 g/L vs <100 g/L), ECOG performance
(≥1 vs 0), albumin and presence of visceral metastasis.
We used a backward stepwise selection procedure in the
multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis to find the
most significant prognostic factors. We calculated hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for each significant prognostic
factors. SAS version 9.2 was used for statistical analyses.

Chemotherapy consisted of docetaxel 75 mg/m2
(1-hour intravenous infusion) plus cisplatin 70 mg/m2
(1- to 3-hour intravenous infusion) on day 1, followed by
fluorouracil 500 mg/m2/d (continuous intravenous infusion)
for 5 days (TPF) every 3 weeks. The use of prophylactic
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was required at each
cycle of chemotherapy. Dose modification criteria were predefined according to the previous report of TPF regimen in
metastatic gastric cancer treatment [16]. All patients required
steroid premedication before docetaxel, and antiemetic
therapy in accordance with existing institutional policies for
highly-emetogenic, docetaxel-based regimens. Treatment
was administered until progressive disease, unacceptable
toxic effects, death, or withdrawal from the study.
Before treatment, a complete medical history
and physical examination were undertaken. Laboratory
tests and tumor assessments were also performed.
Tumor measurements were undertaken every 2 cycles
on chemotherapy treatment. After completion of study
treatments, clinical and radiological assessments were
scheduled for every 2 months. Response of disease
was assessed and confirmed by two investigators using
RECIST, and it was required to be confirmed by follow-up
radiological assessment at 4 weeks after initial assessment.
Adverse effects were graded and recorded according
to NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0.

Statistical analyses
The primary endpoint of this trial was the objective
response to treatment (complete response plus partial
response as defined by RECIST). Secondary endpoints
included: toxicity; progression free survival and overall
survival. PFS time was defined from the time of treatment
initiation until clinically evident disease progression or death
from any cause. OS was defined from the time of initiation
of treatment to the date of death as a result of any cause.
The Simon minimax two-stage design was used to
evaluate a null hypothesis that the true objective reponse
rate (ORR) was ≤30% and an alternative hypothesis that the
ORR was ≥50%, with a type 1 error (α) of 0.10 and type
II error (β) of 0.10. The target accrual was 28 patients in
the first stage, with an additional 11 patients to be enrolled
in the second stage if ≥7 responses were observed. If ≥15
responses of 39, it would warrant further study. Survival
curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and
95% CIs for the medians were provided for progression-free
survival and overall survival. A total of accrual of 43 patients
was planned, with allowance for 10% dropout. Because we
did not have any patient dropout, the 39 patients enrolled
provided us with the desired evaluable patient sample size.
We used a univariate Cox proportional hazard
model to search for significant prognostic factors of
overall survival. Prognostic factors were baseline
