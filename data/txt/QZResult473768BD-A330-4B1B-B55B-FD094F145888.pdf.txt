Abstract
The serine/threonine kinase Pim is known to promote cell
cycle progression and to inhibit apoptosis leading to
tumorigenesis. However, the precise mechanisms remain
unclear. We show, herein, that all the Pim family members
(Pim1, Pim2, and Pim3) bind to and directly phosphorylate
the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 at threonine-157
and threonine-198 residues in cells and in vitro. The Pimmediated phosphorylation induced p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3
protein, resulting in its nuclear export and proteasomedependent degradation. Ectopic expression of Pim kinases
overcome the G1 arrest mediated by wild-type p27Kip1 but not
by phosphorylation-resistant T157A-p27Kip1 or T198A-p27Kip1.
In addition to the posttranslational regulations, p27Kip1
promoter assay revealed that Pim kinases also had the ability
to suppress p27Kip1 transcription. Pim-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of forkhead transcription factors,
FoxO1a and FoxO3a, was involved in the transcriptional
repression of the p27Kip1 gene. In contrast, inhibition of Pim
signaling by expressing the dominant-negative form of Pim1
increased nuclear p27Kip1 level and attenuated cell proliferation. Because the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 plays a crucial role in
tumor suppression by inhibiting abnormal cell cycle progression, Pim kinases promote cell cycle progression and
tumorigenesis by down-regulating p27Kip1 expression at both
transcriptional and posttranslational levels. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Human cancer remains a serious disease, and at present, there is
still no fully critical chemotherapeutic strategy against it. Tumorigenesis occurs when proto-oncogenes are activated and tumor
suppressor genes are, frequently, mutated and inactivated. Most of
the genes are associated with cell cycle progression and cell growth.
Understanding how proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
contribute to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis could be
promising for anticancer drug development.
The serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) kinase pim gene is a protooncogene (1). The pim gene has been identified as a common
integration site of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (2). Pim

kinase has three family gene products (Pim1, Pim2, and Pim3;
ref. 3). They are composed of at least six translational variants:
Pim1 short isoform (Pim1S), Pim1 long isoform (Pim1L), Pim2
short isoform (Pim2S), Pim2 medium isoform (Pim2M), Pim2 long
isoform (Pim2L), and Pim3 in human. Pim kinases have been
implicated in the control of tumorigenesis. In pim1 or pim2
transgenic mice, Pim has been shown to enhance the development
of lymphoma and leukemia (2, 4–6). The expression level of Pim
kinases is frequently elevated in patients with lymphoma, leukemia,
and prostate cancer (4, 6, 7). In particular, the expression of Pim1
has been correlated with measures of clinical outcome (8).
Moreover, pim1 was recently identified as a target of aberrant
somatic hypermutation in non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma and B-cell
lymphoma (9–11), and some of the mutations significantly increase
Pim1 enzymatic activity (12). Thus, it is suggested that Pim kinase
overexpression and activation induce tumorigenesis.
Pim kinases have also been implicated to induce cell cycle
progression and cell growth. Overexpression of Pim kinases is
reported to promote cell cycle and cell growth, whereas pim
knockdown delays them (7, 13, 14). In pim1, pim2, and pim3 triple
knockout mice, the cell number and body size was decreased (15).
Pim1 promotes cell cycle progression at the G1-S and G2-M
transitions. The G1-S–stimulating phosphatase CDC25A was found
to be a substrate of Pim1, and it has been shown that it could be
activated through phosphorylation by Pim1 (16). Furthermore,
Pim1 phosphorylated G2-M–stimulating phosphatase CDC25C and
increased its phosphatase activity (17). Moreover, Pim1 was
reported to phosphorylate C-TAK1 and inactivate its kinase
activity, resulting in CDC25C activation (18). However, the
mechanisms by which Pim kinases stimulate cell cycle progression
and cell growth are not fully understood. Therefore, we tried to
identify novel substrates of Pim1 and to elucidate the mechanism
by which Pim1 induced cell cycle progression and cell growth.
We identified the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 as a novel substrate of
Pim kinases. p27Kip1 is known to be a key molecule that modulates
cell cycle progression at the G1-S transition (19–24). The expression
of p27Kip1 is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranslational
levels (25–28). From the observation of p27Kip1 knockout mice,
p27Kip1 behaved like a tumor suppressor (29). Furthermore, reduced
p27Kip1 expression is frequently observed in most human tumors.
The reduced expression of p27Kip1 was reported to correlate with
tumor progression and poor patient survival (30). Here, we showed
that Pim kinases phosphorylated and down-regulated p27Kip1 at the
posttranslational level. We also showed that Pim kinases repressed
p27Kip1 expression at the transcriptional level by inactivating
Forkhead transcription factors. Moreover, we found the inverse
correlation between pim1 and p27Kip1 mRNA expression in patients
with cancer. These results indicate that down-regulation of p27Kip1

Results
Relationship between Pim1 expression and cell cycle
progression. A previous study reported that the amount of Pim1S
increased at the G1-S transition in chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) BV173 cells (32). We confirmed the increase of endogenous
Pim1S at the G1-S transition in another CML K562 cells after cell
synchronization (data not shown). When HEK293T cells were
transfected with a wt-Pim1S–expressing plasmid, decrease in the
cell number at the G1 phase and increase in the cell number at
S phase were observed (Fig. 1A). These results suggested that Pim
could promote the G1-S transition.
To clarify the mechanisms of G1-S transition, we estimated CDK2
kinase activity in the polyclonal K562/wt-Pim1S and K562/Mock
cells because CDK2 activity is the key regulator for G1-S transition.
We found that CDK2 activity was up-regulated in the Pim1S
transfectant but that the amount of CDK2 was unaffected (Fig. 1B).
It has been well-known that CDK2 activity is regulated by other
regulatory factors. Therefore, we examined whether Pim1S downregulated the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 expression or not. As shown in
Fig. 1C, Pim1S overexpression down-regulated the expression level
of p27Kip1. These results suggest that Pim1S stimulates cell cycle
progression at the G1-S phase, possibly by down-regulating p27Kip1
and activating CDK2.
Pim binds to and phosphorylates p27Kip1 in vitro and in cells.
The concentration of p27Kip1 is known to be transcriptionally and
posttranslationally regulated (25–28). To clarify the mechanisms of
Pim-mediated down-regulation of p27Kip1, we sought to check
whether p27Kip1 was directly phosphorylated by Pim kinases because
overexpression of Pim1S led to a decreased p27Kip1 level (Fig. 1C).
Putative substrate target sequences of Pim have been identified
using a chemically synthesized peptide library (33, 34). Using an
in silico search, we identified two high homologues to Pim consensus
sequences around threonine-157 (T157) and threonine-198 (T198)
residues in p27Kip1 (Fig. 2A, left). Then, we investigated the
interaction between Pim and p27Kip1 by immunoprecipitating
analysis. Figure 2B (left) shows that HA-tagged p27Kip1 was
coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Pim1S, suggesting that
Pim kinases interact with p27Kip1 in cells. To confirm that Pim1S
forms a complex with p27Kip1 at endogenous expression levels, we
performed the immunoprecipitation following Western blot analysis
using K562 and 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 2B, right) because it has already been
shown that Pim1S was up-regulated and potentially had a strong role
in the progression of these cancers (7, 8, 35, 36). Endogenous Pim1S
could be detected in endogenous p27Kip1 immunoprecipitants
(Fig. 2B, right, lanes 2 and 5). These results indicate that Pim1S
physiologically interacts with p27Kip1 in cells.
We then examined whether Pim kinases directly phosphorylated
p27Kip1. The consensus sequence of Pim kinase is very similar to
that of Ser/Thr kinase Akt. The commercially available anti–
phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody could preferentially
recognize the conserved Akt phosphorylation motif (19, 20, 22).
In addition, the predicted Pim phosphorylation sites around T157
and T198 residues in p27 Kip1 have been reported to be
phosphorylated by Akt (19, 20, 22). We thus estimated the Pimmediated phosphorylation at T157 and T198 residues using the Akt

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

substrate antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A (right), the Akt substrate
antibody recognized the phosphorylated form of p27Kip1 only when
HEK293T, K562, and 22Rv1 cells were cotransfected with a wtPim1S–expressing plasmid but not with a kinase-inactive Pim1S
(KD-Pim1S), indicating that Pim1S kinase activity is required for
p27Kip1 phosphorylation. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1,
recombinant GST-tagged Pim1S was incubated in vitro with
recombinant p27Kip1 and the band of phosphorylated p27Kip1 could
be detected. The phosphorylation was inhibited by adding the
Pim1 inhibitor LY294002 (3). Pim1S is known to be phosphorylated
by itself at Ser8 (33). Consistent with this report, Pim1S was
phosphorylated by itself, and the phosphorylation was also
inhibited by LY294002 (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results
suggest that Pim1S directly phosphorylates p27Kip1.
Pim kinases were composed of Pim1S/1L, Pim2S/2M/2L, and
Pim3 in human (3, 14, 37). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2,
all variants were able to phosphorylate p27Kip1. In addition, all
recombinant Pim variants could phosphorylate p27Kip1 in vitro
(data not shown). These results strongly suggest that p27Kip1 is a
substrate of Pim kinases in vivo.
Identification of T157 and T198 as Pim phosphorylation
sites in p27Kip1. p27Kip1 is known to be phosphorylated at serine10 (S10) and threonine-187 (T187) residues, in addition to T157 and
T198 (19). To identify the phosphorylation sites, we first tested
whether Pim1S could phosphorylate NH2-terminal–deleted p27Kip1
mutants DN27 (amino acids 27–198) and DN52 (amino acids 52–
198) and COOH-terminal–deleted p27Kip1 mutants 136STOP
(amino acids 1–136), 156STOP (amino acids 1–156), and 185STOP
(amino acids 1–185). Although Pim1S phosphorylated wild-type,
DN27, DN52, and weakly, 185STOP, Pim1S could not phosphorylate
136STOP or 156STOP, lacking both T157 and T198 residues
(Supplementary Fig. S3). We then prepared four point mutants
(S10A, T157A, T187A, and T198A-p27Kip1) in which predicted
phosphorylation sites were converted to alanine. As shown in
Fig. 2C, the anti-Akt substrate antibody slightly recognized T157Ap27Kip1 or T198A-p27Kip1 even when cells were cotransfected with
Pim1S. Point mutations at S10 or T187 did not affect the band
intensities recognized by the anti-Akt substrate antibody. Immunoblot analysis using anti–phospho-S10 or anti–phospho-T187
p27Kip1 revealed that Pim1 was not associated with p27Kip1
phosphorylation at S10 or T187 residues (Fig. 2C). These results
suggest that both T157 and T198 residues are the Pim
phosphorylation sites. Consistent with these results, mutation at
T157 or T198 residues decreased Pim1S-mediated p27Kip1 phosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 2D). These results strongly indicate that
Pim kinases phosphorylate p27Kip1 at both T157 and T198 residues.
Pim kinases stimulate nuclear export of p27Kip1. It has been
reported that Akt-mediated p27Kip1 phosphorylation at T157 and
T198 residues induced the binding to 14-3-3 protein (19, 20, 22, 38)
and promoted nuclear export of p27Kip1 (19–24, 38). Because Pim
kinases also promoted p27Kip1 phosphorylation at T157 and T198
residues (Fig. 2), we analyzed the interaction between p27Kip1 and
14-3-3 after Pim1-mediated phosphorylation. When HEK293T cells
were transfected with FLAG-tagged wt-p27Kip1, p27Kip1 binding to
endogenoustotal14-3-3(Fig.3A,top)orendogenous14-3-3u (Fig.(Fig.
(Fig. 3A, second panel) was promoted only by HA-tagged wt-Pim1S
expression. As the 14-3-3u mutant (RA), which lost its ligandbinding ability (19), failed to bind to p27Kip1 even in the presence of
wt-Pim1S (Supplementary Fig. S4), the binding to 14-3-3u became
specific. Consistent with the previous reports (19, 20, 22), the
interaction between 14-3-3 and p27Kip1 was weakened when the

T157 or T198 residue in p27Kip1 was converted to Ala (T157A or

T198A) could no longer bind to 14-3-3, even when the cells were
cotransfected with wt-Pim1S (Fig. 3A, lane 8). We also checked the
p27Kip1 binding to other 14-3-3 isoforms (h, q, j, ~, and g) and
found that the exogenously expressed 14-3-3 isoforms bound to
p27Kip1-like endogenous 14-3-3 protein did (Supplementary Fig. S4).
These results suggest that Pim kinases promote 14-3-3 binding to
p27Kip1 by phosphorylating at both T157 and T198 residues.
Next, we investigated the subcellular localization of p27Kip1.
When HT1080 cells were cotransfected with wt-Pim1S and wtp27Kip1, we could observe the nuclear export of wt-p27Kip1 (Fig. 3B,
top) but not that of T157A, T198A, and T157A/T198A-p27Kip1. By
counting, we found that the ratio of cells with cytoplasmic wtp27Kip1 was f80% (Fig. 3B, bottom). However, the percentage of
cells that contained cytoplasmic T157A, T198A, and T157A/T198Ap27Kip1 was <20%. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the
decrease in nuclear p27Kip1 and the increased cytoplasmic p27Kip1
were also observed in Pim1S transfectants (Fig. 3C), indicating that
Pim-mediated p27Kip1 phosphorylation promoted 14-3-3 binding
and nuclear export. To confirm the direct link between p27Kip1
phosphorylation and cell cycle progression, we transfected
wt-Pim1S together with wt-p27Kip1 or phosphorylation-resistant
p27Kip1 into HEK293T cells because their transfection efficiency
was >90% (data not shown). Ectopic expression of wild-type or
mutant p27Kip1 in the absence of wt-Pim1S induced cell cycle arrest
at the G1 phase (Fig. 3D; data not shown). Cotransfection of
wt-Pim1S rescued cells from wt-p27Kip1–mediated, but not T157Aor T198A-p27Kip1–mediated cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The
results clearly indicate that Pim kinases promote cell cycle
progression by phosphorylating and inactivating p27Kip1 in cells.
Promotion of p27Kip1 degradation by Pim kinases. The
cytosolic p27Kip1 was ubiquitinated by ubiquitin ligase KPC1/2

first examined the change in p27Kip1 half-life. Overexpressed Pim1S
stimulates the decrease in p27Kip1 levels (Supplementary Fig. S5).
We next investigated the role of proteasome in Pim1S-mediated
down-regulation of endogenous p27Kip1. The decrease in p27Kip1
expression was attenuated by treatment with proteasome inhibitor
MG132 (Fig. 4A). However, MG132 could not fully rescue the Pimmediated down-regulation of p27Kip1. These results suggest that
Pim kinases down-regulate p27Kip1 level by promoting proteasomedependent degradation and by other mechanisms.
The concentration of p27Kip1 is transcriptionally and posttranslationally regulated (25–28). Therefore, we quantitatively evaluated
the change in p27Kip1 mRNA level by real-time PCR. As shown in
Fig. 4B, overexpression of Pim1S in HEK293T cells down-regulated
the amount of p27Kip1 mRNA to 50% of controls. Consistent with the
previous report (39), imatinib treatment down-regulated Pim1S level
and induced p27Kip1 expression in K562 cells in a dose-dependent
fashion (Supplementary Fig. S6). Under these conditions, imatinib
increased the level of p27Kip1 mRNA (Fig. 4C). The imatinibmediated increase in p27Kip1 mRNA expression was displaced by
ectopic expression of Pim1S (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that
Pim1S down-regulates p27Kip1 level by inducing proteasomedependent degradation and by repressing its transcription.
Pim kinases repress p27Kip1 transcription by phosphorylating and inactivating FoxO transcription factors. It is well
known that p27Kip1 transcription is regulated by FoxO transcription
factors such as FoxO1a, FoxO3a, and FoxO4 (40, 41). In this family,
FoxO3a is reported to contribute mainly to the transcription of the
p27Kip1 gene (27, 40). Using an in silico search, we found that three
residues, threonine-32 (T32), serine-253 (S253), and serine-315
(S315) partially matched the Pim consensus sequence in human
FoxO3a (Fig. 5A, top). Phosphorylation of the residues was reported
to reduce FoxO3a’s transcriptional activity by inducing its nuclear
export (40–42). Because we had discovered that endogenous Pim1S
interacted with endogenous FoxO3a in cells (Fig. 2B, right, lanes 3

and 6), we examined whether Pim could phosphorylate FoxO3a in
cells. When HEK293T cells were transfected with Pim1S and
wt-FoxO3a, we observed the clear bands of phospho-FoxO3a at T32
and S253 residues (Fig. 5A, bottom). The Pim-mediated phosphorylation was not observed in AAA-FoxO3a (T32A/S253A/S315A),
even when Pim1S was overexpressed. Pim1S might regulate FoxO
levels by phosphorylation because the expression level of
wt-FoxO3a, but not AAA-FoxO3a, was diminished by Pim1S
expression. Moreover, a decrease in endogenous Foxo3a expression
and an increase in endogenous FoxO3a phosphorylation at T32 and
S253 residues was observed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5B). We also
confirmed that the Pim1S-mediated phosphorylation of another
FoxO family member, FoxO1a at T24, S256, and S319, resulted in
p27Kip1 transcription inhibition (data not shown). These results
indicate that Pim1S phosphorylates and down-regulates FoxO
transcription factors in cells.
To confirm the involvement of Pim in FoxO-mediated p27Kip1
transcription, we cloned a fragment of the human p27Kip1 promoter
containing the putative FoxO-responsive elements (26) into
pGL4.10 to generate the p27Kip1 reporter vector. In the absence
of Pim1S, transfection of wt-FoxO3a and AAA-FoxO3a, but not

mock or H212R-FoxO3a, increased p27Kip1 promoter activity
(Fig. 5C). The increase in luciferase activity by transfecting wtFoxO3a was suppressed by wt-Pim1S expression. Ectopic expression of wt-Pim1S could not attenuate the AAA-FoxO3a–mediated
increase in p27Kip1 reporter activity (Fig. 5C). These results indicate
that Pim phosphorylate and inactivate FoxO transcription factors
resulting in the suppression of p27Kip1 transcription.
To confirm the negative correlation between pim1S and p27Kip1
mRNA expression in a pathologic condition, we examined their
expression in some tumor tissue (T) compared with corresponding
normal tissue (N) from patients with prostate cancer. It has already
been suggested that Pim1 has a potentially strong role in these
cancer progressions (8). In tumor tissue from patients with
prostate cancer, pim1S expression levels were relatively higher
than in individual normal tissue; however, p27Kip1 expressions were
lower (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that Pim kinases are
associated with tumorigenesis by negatively regulating p27Kip1
expression.
Inhibition of endogenous Pim signaling increased the
amount of p27Kip1 and attenuated cell proliferation. To assess
the role of endogenous Pim signaling in p27Kip1 expression and cell

growth, we generated a dominant-negative form of Pim1 (DN-Pim1;
ref. 13). We then established polyclonal K562 cells that had been
transfected with DN-Pim1 (Fig. 6A, top). The levels of p27Kip1 protein
(Fig. 6A, bottom, left) and p27Kip1 mRNA (Fig. 6A, bottom, right)
were both down-regulated in K562/wt-Pim1S cells although they
increased in K562/DN-Pim1 cells. In addition, we confirmed that
DN-Pim1 had no kinase activity (Supplementary Fig. S7, left).
We observed the increase in p27Kip1 expression in nucleus (N) and
the decrease in p27Kip1 expression in cytoplasm (C; Supplementary
Fig. S7, right). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6B, pim1 gene silencing by
two independent pim1 siRNA resulted in the increase of p27Kip1
expression in 22Rv1 cells. These results confirmed that endogenous
Pim signaling negatively regulated p27Kip1 expression in cells.
Consistent with this increase, inhibition of Pim signaling by
dominant-negative Pim1 (DN-Pim1) diminished the growth of
K562 cells, whereas wt-Pim1S expression promoted cell proliferation

(Fig. 6C). In 22Rv1 cells depleted of Pim1 by siRNA, accumulation of
p27Kip1 was also observed and the growth of the cells was diminished
(Fig. 6D). These results suggest that Pim kinases play an important
role in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation by regulating
p27Kip1 expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.

Discussion
Pim kinases are overexpressed in patients with lymphoma,
leukemia, and prostate cancers (4, 6–8, 26). The ability of Pim to
stimulate cell growth and inhibit apoptosis may contribute to the
promotion of tumorigenesis (3, 5, 13, 31). Previous studies have
reported that Pim1 stimulates cell cycle progression at the G1-S and
G2-M transitions by phosphorylation of p21Waf1/Cip1 and CDC25A
(16, 43) and CDC25C (17, 18). We confirmed that Pim1S overexpression promoted cell cycle progression at both the G1-S and

G2-M transitions in HEK293T and K562 cells (Fig. 1A; data not
shown). Under these conditions, we found an increase in CDK2
activity and down-regulation of CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 expression
(Fig. 1B and C). Pim might accelerate cell cycle progression at the G1S transition in part by down-regulating p27Kip1 expression levels.
There are three genes encoding Pim kinases, pim1, pim2, and
pim3 (3). It is known that the consensus sequences of Pim1, Pim2,
and Pim3 are very similar and that they phosphorylate the same
substrate, such as Bad and 4EBP-1 (14, 33, 34, 44). The depletion of
all pim1, pim2, and pim3 genes is required for the drastic
phenotype of mice (15). In addition, up-regulation of pim2 is
observed in pim1 knockout mice (45). Thus, Pim1, Pim2, and Pim3
could compensate for each function by sharing functional
similarity. Consistent with these reports, we showed that all the
Pim variants could phosphorylate p27Kip1 at T157 and T198
residues (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, p27Kip1 might be an
important substrate of Pim kinases.
We previously reported that T198 residue in p27Kip1 is
phosphorylated by Akt and RSK1/2 (19, 20, 22). These kinases
are regulated through different pathways. Akt is regulated by the
phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathway and RSK1/2 through the Ras/
Raf/MAPK pathway, whereas Pim is regulated by the JAK/STAT
pathway (3). It is still unclear why three kinases phosphorylate the
same residues in p27Kip1. To explain how these kinases coordinate
their contributions to cell cycle progression at the G1-S transition
by down-regulating p27Kip1, we checked the changes in the
amounts of Akt and phospho-Akt (T308) after cell synchronization
in K562 cells. The amounts were not changed throughout the cell
cycle, although the amount of Pim1 was drastically increased at
the G1-S transition (data not shown). Therefore, Pim1S mainly
contributes to p27Kip1 down-regulation at the G1-S phase in K562
cells.
Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 has been thought to regulate its
concentration and subcellular localization (19). CDK2-dependent
phosphorylation at T187 has been well characterized and has
been shown to be associated with proteasome-dependent
degradation (28, 46). The S10 residue was identified as a major
phosphorylation site of p27Kip1 and might regulate the nuclearcytoplasmic shuttling. However, S10 phosphorylation was not
sufficient for its nuclear export (47). Rodier and colleagues (48)
also suggested that another signal might be necessary to direct
p27Kip1 to the cytosol. Previous reports have shown that
phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at T157 or T198 residues was
associated with its binding to 14-3-3 proteins, which drives
cytoplasmic localization (19, 20, 22, 38). Consistent with these
reports, 14-3-3 protein binding to p27Kip1 did not require its
phosphorylation at both T157 and T198 residues at the same
time (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S4). 14-3-3 proteins preferentially bound to p27Kip1 that was phosphorylated at the T198
residue rather than at the T157 residue. Regarding nuclear
export of p27Kip1, phosphorylation at both T157 and T198
residues at the same time might be required for its nuclear
export because single mutation at either T157 or T198 was
enough to abrogate the nuclear export (Fig. 3B). The 14-3-3
proteins were reported to form homodimers or heterodimers
between different isotypes. Binding the dimer to both phosphorylated T157 and phosphorylated T198 might be required for
promoting nuclear export. The nuclear export would be essential
for the G1-S transition because Pim1S expression could not
overcome the G1 cell cycle arrest induced by T157A-p27Kip1 or
T198A-p27Kip1 (Fig. 3D). Therefore, phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

T157 and T198 residues by Pim1 critically contribute to
p27Kip1nuclear export and cell proliferation.
Overexpression of Pim1S decreased p27Kip1 expression (Fig. 1C)
and attenuated the half-life of p27Kip1 (Supplementary Fig. S5). It is
well known that p27Kip1 is degraded in cytosol by ubiquitin ligase
KPC1/2 at the G1-S transition (25). Thus, nuclear-cytoplasmic
shuttling of p27Kip1 by Pim at the G1-S transition may promote its
degradation by KPC1/2. Pim-mediated p27Kip1 down-regulation was
mediated not only by proteasome-dependent degradation (Fig. 4A)
but also by transcriptional repression (Fig. 4B and C). We identified
FoxO transcription factors as new substrates of Pim (Fig. 5A). Pim1S
expression induced the phosphorylation of FoxO3a (Fig. 5A and B)
and inactivated its transcriptional activity (Fig. 5C). We also
confirmed that Pim1S phosphorylated FoxO1a and inactivated its
transcriptional activity as well (data not shown). A previous report
showed that phosphorylation at T32, S253, and S315 residues in
FoxO3a induced 14-3-3 binding, nuclear export, and proteasomemediated degradation (42). Consistent with that report, we found
that Pim1S overexpression decreased the exogenous and endogenous FoxO3a expression level (Fig. 5A and B).
In a physiologic condition, Pim expression was regulated by JAK/
STAT signaling (3). In a pathologic condition, acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML), FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) activation by
in-frame internal tandem duplications (ITD) was reported to
induce the FoxO3a inactivation (49), leading to p27Kip1 downregulation (36). ITD-FLT3 was shown to stimulate Pim1 expression
by activating STAT5 (36). Therefore, Pim1 might down-regulate
p27Kip1 expression by negatively regulating FoxO3a downstream of
ITD-FLT3. In CML, BCR-ABL activates STAT3 and STAT5, leading
to Pim1 expression (39). We detected the increase in p27Kip1
protein and mRNA expression in K562 treated with the BCR-ABL
inhibitor imatinib. We also found that Pim1S transfection repressed
p27Kip1 mRNA expression induced by imatinib (Fig. 4C). These
results suggested that Pim stimulated cell growth in AML and CML
by down-regulating p27Kip1.
In patients with cancer, p27Kip1 is decreased, and its decrease
is strongly correlated with a poor prognosis (30). We detected
the inverse correlation between Pim1S and p27Kip1 mRNA in
prostate cancer (Fig. 5D). A negative correlation between Pim1S
and p27Kip1 expression was also observed in various cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S8). In these tumors, Pim may contribute to
p27Kip1 down-regulation and poor prognosis. Moreover, targeting
Pim1 was shown to impair the survival of hematopoietic cells
that express inhibitor-resistant forms of FLT3 and BCR-ABL (35).
Thus, inhibiting Pim kinases may contribute to the cure of AML
and CML in patients resistant to the inhibitors of FLT3 and
BCR-ABL. Because pim knockout mice do not show serious
defects, Pim kinases are druggable targets, and the small
molecule targeting Pim kinases could be a new anticancer drug.
