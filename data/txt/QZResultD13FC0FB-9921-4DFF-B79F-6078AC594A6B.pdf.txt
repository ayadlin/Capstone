Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Telomere length maintenance is a requisite feature of cellular immortalization and a hallmark of
human cancer. While most human cancers express telomerase activity, approximately 10-15%
employ a recombination-dependent telomere maintenance pathway known as Alternative
Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) that is characterized by multi-telomere clusters and associated
promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies. Here, we show that a DNA double-strand break (DSB)
response at ALT telomeres triggers long-range movement and clustering between chromosome
termini, resulting in homology-directed telomere synthesis. Damaged telomeres initiate increased
random surveillance of nuclear space before displaying rapid directional movement and
association with recipient telomeres over micron-range distances. This phenomenon required
Rad51 and the Hop2-Mnd1 heterodimer, which are essential for homologous chromosome
synapsis during meiosis. These findings implicate a specialized homology searching mechanism in
ALT dependent telomere maintenance and provide a molecular basis underlying the preference for
recombination between non- sister telomeres during ALT.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Homologous recombination (HR) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of DNA repair
that is essential to genome integrity in meiotic and mitotic cells (Mazon et al., 2010;
Moynahan and Jasin, 2010). This form of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair
necessitates an accurate search for homology into duplexed genomic regions by presynaptic
RecA nucleoprotein filaments coating single stranded DNA. Successful capture of
homology entails base pairing between invading single stranded DNA with the
complementary strand of duplex DNA, forming a displacement loop (D-loop). Subsequent
close association of the homologous strands (synapsis) and extension by DNA polymerases
enables template directed DNA repair.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HR mediated DNA repair mechanisms are largely restricted to S and G2 phases in mitotic
cells in eukaryotes when a sister chromosome is present and resection-promoting nucleases
are more active (Aylon et al., 2004; Huertas et al., 2008; Ira et al., 2004). HR between sister
chromatids rather than homologous chromosomes is thought to be the vastly preferred
mechanism of HR in mitotic cells (Johnson and Jasin, 2000). Conversely, meiotic HR is not
limited to sister chromatid recombination, but occurs extensively between sequences on
homologous chromosomes (Neale and Keeney, 2006). Meiotic recombination involves a
lineage restricted, programmatic form of HR that is initiated by Spo11 induced DSBs and
culminates in synapsis of distant homologous loci. This process requires Rad51 and Dmc1
as well as the heterodimeric Hop2-Mnd1 proteins, which promote Rad51 and Dmc1
dependent D-loop formation in vitro and are epistatic to these RecA homologs during
meiosis in yeast and in mammalian organisms (Bishop, 1994; Chi et al., 2007; Petukhova et
al., 2003; Pezza et al., 2007). Thus, 3-dimensional genome organization during physiologic
meiotic recombination is intimately linked to the repair mechanisms that execute homology
searches between non-sister, homologous chromosomes.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Large stretches of homologous DNA sequences encase eukaryotic chromosome termini,
composed of repetitive G-rich sequences contained within a specific nucleoprotein
chromatin structure that protects against DNA damage responses. Deprotected chromosome
ends exhibit both of the major DSB repair pathways, NHEJ and HR, depending on context.
Loss of telomeric sequence due to replicative shortening, or deprotection in the absence of
specific telomere binding proteins, results in a high incidence of NHEJ dependent telomeretelomere fusions (Counter et al., 1992; Dimitrova et al., 2008). Conversely, cells that use the
alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism display elevated HR at telomeres
(Dunham et al., 2000). A subset of ALT telomeres coalesces into characteristic ALTassociated PML Body (APB) structures that display multiple telomeres from different
chromosomes in association with PML (Draskovic et al., 2009; Jegou et al., 2009; Molenaar
et al., 2003; Yeager et al., 1999). These multi-telomere bodies are thought to be sites of
homology-directed telomere synthesis. Mutations within certain chromatin associated genes
are commonly found in ALT cancers (Heaphy et al., 2011; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012).
However, the nature of the initiating stimulus for ALT is unclear, as are mechanisms that
drive recombination within APBs.

One plausible mechanism is that DSB responses at a subset of ALT telomeres would
represent a seminal event that initiates the search and capture of distant homologous DNA.
Pairing and recombination between telomeres from different chromosomes during ALT
would necessitate long range telomere movement. Damage dependent increases in local
DNA mobility have been documented in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which may
suggest that increased movement of broken chromosomes assists in repair of these loci
(Aten et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2013; Dimitrova et al., 2008; Dion et al., 2012; Krawczyk et
al., 2012; Mine-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012; Roukos et al., 2013). Interestingly, DNA
damaging agents increase the prevalence of APBs in ALT cells, and a subset of ALT
telomeres accumulates DNA repair proteins (Cesare et al., 2009; Fasching et al., 2007).
Furthermore, while the majority of telomeres in ALT-positive osteosarcoma U2OS cells
display relatively slow mobility confined to a radius of less than 0.5μm, up to 15% of
telomeres show unusually high mobility (Jegou et al., 2009; Molenaar et al., 2003). Yet,
how increased mobility would facilitate efficient associations between damaged DNA and
homologous genomic regions remains enigmatic, as are molecular events underlying such
migration of DNA across the nucleoplasm lacking canonical structures of cellular transport
such as microtubules.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here, we provide direct evidence that telomeric DSB responses drive inter-telomere
associations in the context of ALT telomeric chromatin. Strikingly, increased ALT telomere
mobility culminated in rapid and directional movement over micron distances toward a
recipient telomere, providing a real-time cellular visualization of homology search and
synapsis in a mammalian cell nucleus. This process required the HR machinery including
Rad51, which could be directly visualized in between recombining telomeres, representing a
putative recombination intermediate. Moreover, these studies reveal that ALT cells
commandeer proteins critical for meiotic recombination searching mechanisms, providing
insights into this specialized form of HR driven telomere maintenance.

Results
Telomere Double-Strand Breaks Increase the Hallmarks of ALT Recombination

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Telomeric chromatin is bound by a set of proteins that recognize double and single stranded
repetitive telomere DNA, termed the Shelterin complex (Cesare and Karlseder, 2012; Palm
and de Lange, 2008). Fusion of the telomere repeat binding factor, TRF1, to the FokI
nuclease catalytic domain targets DSBs specifically at telomeres in both telomerase positive
and ALT cells, leading to a robust induction of DSB responses that extend hundreds of
kilobases into subtelomeric chromatin (Tang et al., 2013). Further characterization of TRF1FokI expression revealed a DSB response equivalent to approximately 1-2 Gy ionizing
radiation in U2OS cells as assessed by western blot using antibodies to γH2AX, and
phosphorylated-ATM (Figures 1A and B). Notably, Chk2 phosphorylation was not
increased to similar levels as phospho-ATM, consistent with prior reports that telomere
damage signals are not efficiently transmitted to some ATM substrates (Cesare et al., 2013).
Despite reduced transmission of ATM phosphorylation to Chk2, TRF1-FokI expression
resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, consistent with
the induction of a G2/M checkpoint (Figure S1A).

Interestingly, TRF1-FokI expression resulted in up to 4-fold increases in average telomere
foci size and reduced numbers of telomeres in each of 4 different ALT positive cell lines in
comparison to cells expressing the nuclease inactive TRF1-FokI D450A mutant (Figures 1C,
1D and S1B). Telomere foci size increases did not occur in telomerase negative primary
human IMR90 fibroblasts or 4 different telomerase positive cell lines. Telomere length
difference between ALT and telomerase positive cells was not sufficient to explain foci size
increases, as TRF1-FokI expression did not significantly increase telomere foci size in the
telomerase positive HeLa 1.3 cells (Figure 1D), which have a mean telomere length
comparable to ALT cell lines.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Telomeres within these larger foci in ALT cells contain chromosomally attached telomeres.
This is supported by the observation that metaphase chromosome spreads from D450A and
WT TRF1-FokI were not appreciably different with respect to the percentage of
chromosome ends displaying telomeric signal, and by the presence of subtelomeric
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) signals or subtelomeric lac operator transgene
repeats juxtaposing telomeres in interphase U2OS cells (Shanbhag et al., 2010) (Figures
S1C-E). Furthermore, expression of TRF1-FokI increased the percentage of multiple
subtelomeric FISH signals accumulating at a telomere cluster (Figure 1E). These data are in
agreement with previous reports that APB bodies contain chromosomally attached telomeres
(Draskovic et al., 2009). However, they do not exclude the possibility that extrachromosomal telomeric repeats (ECTRs), which increase in response to DNA damage, are
also present in these large telomere bodies (Cesare and Griffith, 2004; Fasching et al., 2007).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

These findings suggest that DSB responses at ALT telomeric chromatin provide the
initiating stimulus for telomere clustering. Consistent with this expectation, TRF1-FokI
expression induced multiple hallmarks of ALT recombination, including significant
increases in telomeres associated with promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APBs) and telomere
associated DNA synthesis as evidenced by incorporation of thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2’deoxyuridine (edU) in non S-phase cells (Figures 2A-D and Figure S2A). Similar findings
were not detectable in telomerase positive cells. Expression of TRF1-FokI also increased ccircle formation, a specific indicator of ALT activity (Figures S2B-E) (Henson et al., 2009).
Moreover, TRF1-FokI expression increased telomere length heterogeneity by Terminal
Restriction Fragment Analysis in 3 different ALT cell lines (Figure 2E). The increased
heterogeneity could result from a combination of factors, including telomere cutting by
TRF1-FokI, as well as ALT recombination associated length changes and ECTR generation.
These telomeres were sensitive to digestion by Bal-31, an exonuclease that degrades duplex
DNA from both 3’ and 5’ ends, indicating that the longer telomere fragments observable
following TRF1-FokI WT expression were not a consequence of telomere-telomere end
joining (Figure 2F).
Double-Strand Breaks Initiate Directional ALT Telomere Movement and Clustering
The presence of intense ALT-like telomere clusters suggests that DSB responses initiate a
homology search process, followed by synapsis and recombination between distant
telomeres. To directly test this hypothesis, we visualized telomere movement using an
inducible mCherryTRF1-FokI fused to a modified estradiol receptor and destabilization

domain, which allowed small molecule induction by administration of 4-hydroxytamoxifen
and Shield1 ligand (Figure 3A). Following a 1-hour induction period, TRF1-FokI expressing
cells were monitored over the following hour by capturing confocal z stacks of the entire
nucleus every 2 minutes. Telomere foci were tracked in the z-projected plane, and a
registration process (Thevenaz et al., 1998) assisted normalization for cellular movement.
Strikingly, telomeres in TRF1-FokI WT expressing cells demonstrated increased mobility
and an average of 7 telomere-telomere clustering events per hour between foci separated by
up to 5μm (Figures 3B, C, E, F and Movie S1). Telomere clustering and movement were
greatly diminished in the nuclease inactive D450A mutant or in cells expressing mCherryTRF1 (Figures 3B-D and Movies S2 and S3). Importantly, less frequent instances of
clustering were observed at mCherry-D450A and TRF1 containing telomeres, consistent
with a previous report of an association of two telomeres in an unperturbed U2OS cell
(Molenaar et al., 2003). TRF1-FokI induced DSBs at ALT telomeres greatly increase the
frequency of telomere associations that normally occur in these cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if DSBs at other regions of the genome in ALT cells would demonstrate
similar movement and clustering as those observed at telomeres, we monitored targeted and
random DSB positions at non-telomeric locations. Fusion of FokI to the Lac repressor
(mCherryLacIFokI) enables efficient visualization of DSB responses at lac operator repeat
sequences integrated into chromosome 1p36 (Shanbhag et al., 2010). mCherryLacIFokI
DSBs did not display large increases in mobility at this locus in U2OS cells (Figures S3A
and B). GFP-53BP1 movement and clustering was also minimal at most ionizing radiation
induced foci during time lapse imaging in U2OS cells (Figure S3C). Conversely, telomeric
DSBs moved coordinately with the sub-telomeric LacO locus in cells expressing both GFPLacI and mCherryTRF1-FokI (Figure S3D). The lack of substantial DSB movement at nontelomeric regions of the genome is consistent with reports that ALT cells display elevated
recombination at telomeres, but not elsewhere in the genome (Bechter et al., 2003; Dunham
et al., 2000).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Importantly, the robust increase in ALT telomere movement allowed a quantitative analysis
of this type of chromatin movement. Telomere tracks were subjected to a mean squared
displacement (MSD) analysis, which plots the average squared displacements at each time
interval, given by equation MSD = <(x(t+Δt)-x(t))2>, where x is the position of the focus and
t is time. The MSD trajectories were then fitted to a single exponential time dependence
diffusion model described by where is a generalized coefficient, and α is a time dependence
coefficient which can be used to determine the type of motion. For α ~ 1, the particle is
undergoing normal diffusion, and α < 1 represents sub-diffusion, also known as anomalous
diffusion. Subdiffusive target searches in cells can result from molecular crowding of the
nucleus and cytoplasm (Guigas and Weiss, 2008). Finally, α ≥ 2 represents an exponential
dependence on time that indicates that the particle is moving in a directed manner, an
example of which is active cellular transport.
A comparison of averaged MSD trajectories for all telomeres in TRF1-FokI WT or D450A
expressing U2OS cells revealed that α = 0.8 for WT and α = 0.7 for D450A, both
characteristic of subdiffusive motion (Figure 3D). The coefficient, which describes the

magnitude of the behavior characterized by α, was greater for WT than for D450A, with
values of 4.7×10−2μm2s−α and 3.3×10−2μm2s−α respectively. Calculation of time-dependent
diffusion coefficient D(t) = MSD/t = Γtα−1 showed that the diffusion coefficient decreases
linearly with time with a slope of α-1 when plotted on a log-log scale, consistent with
subdiffusive motion (Saxton, 2007). For D450A, D(t) at 15 minutes was 1.4×10−2μm2min−1,
consistent with values for normal U2OS telomeres (Molenaar et al., 2003), and decreased to
0.9×10−2μm2min−1 at the end of the observation period (Figure S3A). For WT, however,
D(t) was consistently elevated at 2.6×10−2μm2min−1 and 1.9×10−2μm2min−1 at 15 minutes
and 60 minutes respectively (Figure S3E). These results indicate that damaged telomeres
move faster and roam a larger nuclear territory.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While all telomeres considered in sum demonstrated diffusive movement, it was readily
apparent from imaging experiments that faster, “incoming” telomeres displayed a striking
long-range directional movement prior to association with a comparatively slow-moving
“recipient” telomere (Figure 3B, E and Movie S1). For a quantitative analysis of this
observation, mobility data from telomeres that merged into a recipient telomere was
isolated. The terminal behavior of such telomeres was characterized by MSD analysis of the
last 10 timepoints of each track, with the ultimate timepoint representing the merge event.
The shape of the resulting MSD trajectory suggested an initial, increased diffusive
movement for Δt of up to 10 minutes, followed by a transition to directed movement at large
Δt (Figure 3G) This change in behavior was clearly visualized on a log-log plot. The α
coefficient for the initial portion of the clustering telomere trajectory was 0.9 suggestive of
diffusive motion, but between Δt of 12-18 minutes, there was a clear transition of α to ~ 2.3,
indicative of directed movement (Figure 3H).
The average displacement of telomeres during this directed phase was ~1.3μm with up to
4-5 μm observed for some tracks (Figure 3E, F). Following the clustering event, the merged
telomere foci demonstrated reduced movement (Figure 3I), suggesting the searching process
that underlies directional movement had concluded. Interestingly, the less mobile,
“recipient” telomere was associated with PML in 85% of clustering events (Figure S3F).
This supports a model in which PML promotes clustering and recombination of telomeres
within APBs (Chung et al., 2011; Draskovic et al., 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further address whether the driving force behind ALT telomere movement is a DSB
response, spontaneous telomere clustering events in mcherryTRF1 expressing VA13 cells
were quantified with respect to colocalization of GFP-53BP1 as a marker of DSBs. Greater
than 60% of clustering telomeres accumulated GFP-53BP1 prior to association, while 15%
of all telomeres were associated with GFP-53BP1. This indicates that telomere movement
and clustering is closely correlated with a local DNA damage response (Figure S3G, H).
Homologous Recombination Predominates at ALT Telomere DSBs
We postulated that the presence of random surveillance followed by directional DSB
induced telomere movement is a consequence of a homology search and capture between
distant telomeres. Resection of telomeric ends would be a critical determinant of this
pathway choice. RPA localization was assessed at telomeres in cells expressing TRF1-FokI
in ALT and telomerase positive cells. HeLa 1.3 did not significantly accumulate RPA at

telomeres. Conversely, telomeres in both U2OS and VA13 cells were associated with RPA
at baseline, which further increased in the presence of TRF1-FokI (Figures 4A, B).
Furthermore, expression of TRF1-FokI in U2OS cells resulted in an increase in singlestranded telomeres as assessed by electrophoresis and hybridization of telomeric probes
under native conditions (Figure 4C). The increased ssDNA was largely derived from
telomeric overhangs, since the native single stranded telomeric signal was reduced following
treatment with ExoI ssDNA exonuclease (Figure S4A).
Consistent with the observed increases in resection, homologous recombination proteins
BRCA1 and Rad51 were present directly overlying 20-60% of telomeres in ALT cells and
only 5-15% of telomeres in telomerase positive cells after TRF1-FokI DSB induction
(Figures 4D and E). 53BP1 immunofluoresence juxtaposed BRCA1 in both ALT and
telomerase positive cells, consistent with known differences of BRCA1 and 53BP1
chromatin localization adjacent to DSBs (Figures 4D and S4B) (Chapman et al., 2012; Tang
et al., 2013).
Rad51 and the HR Machinery Control Directional ALT Telomere Movement and Clustering

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

These observations raise the possibility of homology directed telomere movement,
analogous to the reported Rad51 dependency for DSB movement that occurs during
homology searches in yeast (Dion et al., 2012; Kalocsay et al., 2009; Mine-Hattab and
Rothstein, 2012; Oza et al., 2009). To test this hypothesis, we examined TRF1-FokI induced
telomere clustering following siRNA-targeted depletion of factors involved in either HR or
NHEJ (Figure 5A and S5A). Knockdown of NBS1 and SMC5 reduced telomere clustering
in accord with their known involvement in ALT (Potts and Yu, 2007; Wu et al., 2003;
Zhong et al., 2007). Similar reductions were observed in cells following knockdown of
either BRCA2 or Rad51, but not 53BP1 (Figure 5A) (Jiang et al., 2007). Interestingly, ALT
telomere clustering was independent of BRCA1, consistent with the HR competency of cells
that exhibit extensive resection as a consequence of 53BP1 deficiency (Bouwman et al.,
2010; Bunting et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Rad51 molecules nucleate onto RPA-coated ssDNA forming a dynamic nucleoprotein
filament which mediates the presynaptic search for homology (Renkawitz et al., 2014).
Remarkably, expression of GFP-tagged Rad51 in VA13 cells allowed visualization of GFPRad51 filaments that originate specifically at telomeres and extended to distant telomeres
(Figure 5B). Live cell imaging revealed that clustering could proceed by rapid shortening of
the GFP-Rad51 filament with synchronous directional movement of the incoming telomere
(Figures 5C and Movie S4). Of 35 clustering events in cells in which a bridging filament
formation was evident, 86% showed Rad51 localization. Rad51 filament could be directly
visualized between recombining telomeres in approximately 46% of cases in which Rad51
was observable at telomeres (Figure S5B).
MSD analysis revealed that Rad51 knockdown restricted telomere mobility as well as
telomere clustering events that occur as a result of directed movement (Figures 5D, E and
Movies S5, S6). Interestingly, telomere clustering was decreased by expression of an
ATPase defective dominant negative mutant of Rad51, K133R, which inhibits HR in mouse
cells and has been reported to lock Rad51 filaments into an extended conformation that

Hop2-Mnd1 Regulate ALT Telomere Movement and Recombination
TRF1-FokI DSB-induced telomere recombination resembles certain aspects of
recombination between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, which is also initiated by
programmed DSBs and requires RecA homologs Rad51 and Dmc1. The Hop2-Mnd1
heterodimer is necessary for Dmc1 and Rad51 dependent inter-homolog recombination in
vivo during gametogenesis in yeast and in mice (Leu et al., 1998; Petukhova et al., 2003),
and strongly stimulates Rad51 or Dmc1 dependent D-loop formation in vitro (Bugreev et al.,
2014; Chi et al., 2007; Petukhova et al., 2005; Pezza et al., 2007). Moreover, Hop2-Mnd1 or
Dmc1 mutant yeast and mice display epistasis with respect to meiotic chromosome interhomolog synapsis. Hop2-Mnd1 binds double stranded DNA and induces rapid condensation
of large stretches of DNA in vitro, consistent with its requirement for homolog synapsis
(Pezza et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Hop2 protein was broadly expressed in all 16 different ALT cell lines and in telomerase
positive cancer cell lines tested, with lower levels detected in primary human fibroblasts
(Figures 6A and S6A-C). Endogenous Hop2 localized to approximately 10-20% of TRF1FokI damaged telomeres in VA13 cells and at lower levels in the absence of TRF1-FokI
(Figure S6E, F). GFP-Hop2 foci localized adjacent to telomeres in a subset of ALT cells and
foci formation was completely ablated by an M110P point mutant within the Hop2 Leucine
Zipper domain (Figures S6G, H). This domain is required for homolog pairing and
recombination, with the Leucine Zipper also being necessary for Hop2 dependent D-loop
formation in vitro (Pezza et al., 2006). Hop2 or Mnd1 knockdown strongly reduced telomere
clustering, mobility and directional movement to levels observed in D450A control cells
(Figures 6B-D, S6D and Movie S7). Hop2-Mnd1 depletion did not affect Rad51 localization
to damaged telomeres (Figure S6I), in agreement with established roles for the heterodimer
in meiotic inter-homolog pairing but not Rad51 or Dmc1 recruitment to Spo11 dependent
DSBs (Petukhova et al., 2003).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if these results would be recapitulated with respect to telomere clustering and
recombination in ALT cell lines that did not express TRF1-FokI, we examined several
different ALT lines for spontaneous APB formation following knockdown of Hop2 or Mnd1
with 5 different targeting siRNAs (Figures 6E, F and S7A, B). Knockdown of either Hop2
or Mnd1 significantly reduced APB formation in each of these lines. The reduction in APBs
could be fully rescued by stable expression of full length Hop2, which is resistant to a
siRNA targeted to the 3’UTR (Figure 6G). To assess the impact of Hop2-Mnd1 on ALT
telomere recombination, telomere chromatid exchanges were assessed by chromosome
orientation-FISH (CO-FISH). Knockdown of Hop2 or Mnd1 reduced telomere chromatid
exchanges by 50% or greater in ALT cells (Figures 6H, I and S7C). Collectively, these data
reveal that the forces driving directional telomere movement are intimately connected to the
mechanism of ALT telomere recombination based lengthening (Figure 7).

Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The phenomenon of DSB movement has been described in prokaryotes, yeast and also in
mammalian cells within distinct experimental contexts (Aten et al., 2004; Dimitrova et al.,
2008; Dion et al., 2012; Kalocsay et al., 2009; Lesterlin et al., 2013; Mine-Hattab and
Rothstein, 2012; Oza et al., 2009; Roukos et al., 2013). Telomeres appear to be a particularly
predisposed genomic location to DNA damage induced mobility increases. Diffusive
movement of damaged telomeres in telomerase positive cells has been reported in several
independent studies (Chen et al., 2013; Dimitrova et al., 2008). Notably, the NHEJ
promoting factor 53BP1 was required for movement of deprotected mouse telomeres.
However, TRF1-FokI induced directional ALT telomere mobility required HR factors and
was independent of 53BP1, indicative of distinct mechanisms underlying telomere mobility
in each case. We postulate that extensive end resection and more prominent accumulation of
HR factors at damaged ALT telomeric chromatin contributes to these differences (Figure 7).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In this study, expression of TRF1-FokI enabled quantitative characterization of an
unanticipated type of chromatin movement. Damaged ALT telomeres initially roamed a
larger nuclear territory at greater velocities than D450A controls, but notably, these
movements culminated in rapid and directional movements of up to 5μm to synapse with a
more stationary recipient telomere. These displacements were also much larger in magnitude
and occurred over a longer time period than those of stochastic unidirectional “jumps” that
could be seen in interphase chromatin (Levi et al., 2005). We note, however, that preselection of clustering tracks in our analysis introduces a bias of describing only highly
mobile particles. We limit our analysis of directionality to clustering telomeres, and do not
preclude the possibility that a proportion of non-clustering telomeres could move
directionally.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To our knowledge, directional ALT telomere movement provides the first example of real
time visualization of homology searches and synapsis in mammalian cells. Given our data,
we favor a model in which Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments interrogate surrounding nuclear
space, leading to homology capture of a non-sister telomere and subsequent directional
movement during synapsis (Figure 7). Interestingly, dynamic formation of long stretches of
prokaryotic RecA coated filaments mediated rapid associations between DSBs and
homologous genomic regions that are separated by 1.3μm (Lesterlin et al., 2013), which are
similar to the distances of directional phase movement we describe for ALT telomeres. The
reported structure of ssDNA filaments in association with RecA reveals an extended
conformation that is stretched to ~1.5 fold longer B-form DNA (Chen et al., 2008). Thus, it
is predicted that 1.3μm of nuclear space connecting non-sister telomeres could theoretically
require only ~2.5kb of Rad51 ssDNA filament for directional movement, which is well
within the length possible for ALT telomeres. Furthermore, as vertebrate telomeres contain
extensive regions of homology consisting of TTAGGG repeats, in effect every chromosome
is a “homolog” with respect to telomere recombination. This feature of primary telomere
sequence would be predicted to increase the probability of recombination between different
chromosomes, enabling successful capturing of distant homology on timescales similar to
those observed in much smaller genomes. It should also be noted that not all recombining
telomeres displayed Rad51 foci, consistent with the presence of Rad51 independent

mechanisms of ALT in type II survivors of telomerase deficiency in yeast (Chen et al.,
2001).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Several obvious parallels exist between meiotic recombination and ALT. Both processes
involve DSB responses to initiate recombination between homologous DNA sequences on
non-sister chromatids. Hop2-Mnd1 uniquely contributes to chromosome pairing in meiotic
recombination and ALT, but is not known to be important for sister chromatid
recombination. Both constituents of this heterodimer are broadly expressed in ALT and
telomerase positive cancers, yet appear to promote telomere recombination only in cells that
use ALT. This may be a consequence of the known interaction of Hop2-Mnd1 with Rad51,
which did not efficiently nucleate damaged telomeres in telomerase positive cells. It is also
plausible that other factors related to the specific chromatin environment in ALT cells, such
as the absence of ATRX and the association between ALT and defective histone chaperone
activity (Heaphy et al., 2011; Lovejoy et al., 2012; O'Sullivan et al., 2014; Schwartzentruber
et al., 2012), may promote inter-telomere recombination. Mechanistic studies into this
process are warranted, as is the extent to which ALT recapitulates known mechanisms of
meiotic recombination.

Experimental Procedures
Cell culture
Unless otherwise stated in the Extended Experimental Procedures, all cell lines were grown
in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. VA13 cell line
refers to WI-38 VA-13 subline 2RA.
Transfections and lentiviral transductions
Transient plasmid transfections were carried out with LipoD293 (Signagen), and siRNA
transfections with Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Concentrated TRF1-FokI lentivirus with polybrene (8ug/ml) diluted in media
was added to cells at a minimum titer resulting in greater than 90% expression at 24 hours
by immunofluorescence. Analyses were performed 16 hours after transfection of plasmids,
and 48-72 hours after siRNA transfection. Analyses were performed 24 hours after
transduction of cells with Flag-TRF1-FokI lentivirus.

Immunofluorescence, IF-PNA FISH and subtelomeric FISH
Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Fixed coverslips were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X100 for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Primary antibody incubation was performed at 37°C in a humidified chamber for 20 minutes
unless otherwise indicated. For immuno-FISH, coverslips were first stained with the primary
antibody, fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature and dehydrated in ethanol series. After
denaturation at 75°C for 5 minutes, coverslips were incubated with TelC-Cy3 PNA probe
(Panagene) overnight at room temperature, then washed and mounted. For subtelomeric
FISH, cells were fixed in freshly prepared 3:1 methanol:acetic acid for 5 minutes and
dehydrated in ethanol series. Subtelomeric probes (Cytocell), were mixed with PNA probe
in hybridization buffer (65% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2X SSC).

Coverslips inverted onto the hyb + probe mix were denatured for 2 minutes at 75°C and
incubated overnight at 37°C. Coverslips were washed once with Agilent FISH wash buffer 1
for 2 minutes at 65°C, washed once with wash buffer 2 for 1 minute and mounted.
Live cell imaging
Cells were transfected with mCherry-ER-DD-TRF1-FokI 16 hours prior to induction with 4OHT and Shield1 ligand for 60 minutes. Confocal images were acquired under temperature
controlled conditions calibrated to 37°C, using a 100× 1.4 NA objective on an inverted
fluorescence microscope (DM6000, Leica Microsystems) equipped with an automated XYZ
stage (Ludl Electronic Products), a charge-coupled device camera (QuantEM 512SC,
Photometrics), an X-LIGHT Confocal Imager (Crisel Electrooptical Systems), and a
SPECTRA X Light Engine (Lumencor), controlled by Metamorph Software (MDS
Analytical Technologies). Images were collected as z stacks at 0.6 μm intervals that covered
the entire nucleus, at 2-minute intervals for a total of 60 minutes. A detailed description of
MSD analysis can be found in the Extended Experimental Procedures.
Analysis of telomere foci size and clustering

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For measurements of telomeric foci size, ImageJ (NIH) was used to apply a constant
threshold to images and subsequent binarization. Foci sizes were measured as square pixels
for each telomeric focus within a nucleus and the average size was calculated for each
nucleus analyzed. For analysis of clustering following siRNA transfection, a cluster was
defined as a telomeric focus equal to or greater than fourfold the area as based on the radius,
compared to the average size of undamaged telomeres.
Statistics
Unpaired t tests were used to generate two-tailed p values.

Figure 7. Model for a Specialized Homology Search Mechanism that drives ALT Telomere
Recombination

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A specialized homology searching mechanism is required for synapsis between distant
telomeres. Extensive end resection at ALT telomeres facilitates a Rad51 dependent
homology search. Homology capture followed by synapsis and congression of
homologously paired non-sister telomeres would be responsible for directional telomere
movement. This ALT telomere recombination mechanism relies in part on Rad51 and Hop2Mnd1 to promote synapsis between non-sister telomeres.
